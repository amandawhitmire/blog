The preparation of an extended account^ of the Odonata of Mexico and Central America has induced me to study the relations of these insects to various factors of their environment, with the results here set forth.
The facts on which this study is based, in so far as the Odonata are concerned, are contained in the Biologia volume, to which reference must be made for further details.
Since the completion of that work, I have received, through the kindness of Mr. H. T. Van Ostrand, specimens of Enallagma prcevarum, Opionceschiia armata and Sym'petrum, illotum virgulum, taken at or near Real del Monte, Hidalgo, Mexico, which add to our knowledge of the distribution of these three species as given in the Biologia.
The first and third are labelled as having been captured at 9,000 feet elevation, or the highest altitude yet recorded for Odonata in Mexico or Central America.
These additional data are included in the following pages.
General Conditions Determining Odonate Distribution.
The actual distribution of the Odonata is determined by the conditions under which their aquatic larvae are able to exist.
The distribution of the larvae, so far as the present region is concerned, is almost entirely unknown.
Our present information refers to the appearance of the imagos in certain localities, and the summary herewith presented ^ Odonata, by P. P. Calvert, forming pp.

rests on the unproven assumption that the adults do not wander far from the waters in which they have passed their earUer stages or in which their offspring are capable of surviving.
This assumption is one of the weaknesses in the following attempted generalizations; another is the real scantiness of our knowledge of the distribution of even the winged individuals.
How scanty this is may be seen by a glance over the list of localities in Honduras, Nicaragua, etc., in Table A and in the columns for these countries in Table B of the Introduction to the Biologia volume quoted and a study of Tables 6-8 of the present paper.
It must be distinctly understood, therefore, that all which follows is subject to future correction in these two important particulars.
In spite of these disadvantages, however, some generalization has been deliberately attempted, in the belief that by so doing progress in investigation wdll be hastened much more than if no such summary were ventured.
The Chief Odonatological Features of Mexico and Central America.
These are : the practical absence of the subfamily Cordulinse,^ some species of which have been recorded from corresponding latitudes in the Old World.
Absence of the following genera, conspicuous or well developed in other parts of America: (a) in Northern America,^ Ophiogomphus, Gomphus, Dromogomphus, Odogomphus, Celithemis, Leucorhinia; (h) in South America, Lais, Thore, Euthore, Microstigma, Telagrion, Leptagrion, Diastatops, Potamothemis ; (c) in the West Indies, Scapanea.
The small number of genera, seven out of seventy-one, which are restricted to this area.
They are Pseudostigma, Thaumatoneura, Paraphlehia, Hesperagrion, Anisagrion, Oplonceschna and Pseudoleon.
Three of these (Hesperagrion, Oplonceschna, Pseudoleon) embrace only one species each.
Oplonceschna and Pseudoleon should be good fliers and, therefore, one would not expect their hmited distribution.
The unity of the district, in that only one genus {Hesperagrion) is restricted to Mexico north of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, none to the * Already pointed out by Carpenter, Scient.

30 area between the latter and the Isthmus of Nicaragua and only one (Thaumatoneura) to the Costa Rican-Panaman section.
The predominant Calopterygine genus is Hetcerina with 17 species out of 23 for the subfamily.
Several species (H. americana, tricolor, titia, macropus, capitalis) show a marked tendency to reduction in size of the pterostigma in some of the western portions of their ranges, but the geographical areas in which this reduction is strongly marked for one species (e.g., macropus in Guatemala) are not necessarily those in which it is displayed by another {e.g., americana).
Amphipteryx is interesting as presenting some features intermediate between those of this subfamily and the Agrioninse.
Only one Old World genus (Calopteryx) is represented and its existence here rests on a single specimen.
Lestince.
Six of the 7 species belong to the cosmopolitan Lestes.
AgrionincB.
Of 24 genera, 3 only {Argia, EnaUagma, Ischnura) have been recorded from the Old World.
Five of the 7 endemic Odonate genera belong here.
Of the 112 species, 48 belong to Argia; next follow Protoneura with 7 species and Telebasis with 6.
Six species (of 3 genera) are of the exclusively Neotropical Pseudostigmatina, including some of the linearly largest known Odonata of the world.
Gomphince.
None of the genera are extra-American.
Erpetogomphus is the predominant genus of the subfamily in the northern part of our district, Epigomphus in the southern.
Cordulegasterince.
The single genus of our area, Cordulegastcr, is Holarctic.
Mshnince.
Three {Anax, JEshna, Gynacantha) of the six genera are also found in the Old World, but none of the species extends thither.
One of the seven endemic genera belongs here (OplonascJma) .
/Eshna has the largest number of species.
Cordulince.
The single record for this subfamily, from near the northern limit of our district, is of the Holarctic and Pala^otropical Macromia.
Libellulince.
Of 28 genera, one (Pseudoleon) is endemic, five (LibclIvla, Tholymis, Tramea, Pantala, Sympetrum) are regarded as also occurring in the Old World.
The only Odonate species common to our area and to the Old World — Pantala flavescens (and Sympetrum corruptum?)
— are of this subfamily.
Predominant genera are Libellula, Micrathyria, Orthemis, Erythrodiplax, Brechmorhoga , Tramea, Perithemis and Erythemis.

463 Relations of the Mexican-Central American Odonate Fauna TO THOSE of other ArEAS.
The study of the species of Odonata found over large parts of Mexico has shown that, to the northward, many of them occupy also considerable portions of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California (in the last named possibly to San Francisco), although their northern boundary line has not been determined in any of these States.
'* Therefore, all species, subspecies or varieties found in Mexico and Central America and which may extend also into these four States of the United States, but not beyond them, nor into the West Indies nor South America, have been considered as endemic.
With this explanation, which applies to all the tables in this paper, the general relations of the Odonate fauna may be learned from an inspection of Table 1.
A further analysis of the relations of the fauna is given in Table 2, wherein, passing from north to south and, in Mexico, from plateau to lowlands, the decrease in the northern element and the increase in the southern element is clearly shown.
Even on the Mexican plateau, excluding its highest portion,^ as the most northern and most elevated section of the present faunal district, the southern element, measured by the number of the "exclusively South American" species, is almost as strong as the northern, represented by the "exclusively Northern American" species'' — a striking fact when the narrow land connection with South America is contrasted with the very much wider union with the United States, and the geological history of the plateau is borne in mind.
It is of further interest to note that while 15 exclusively Northern American species are found on the plateau, 14 Northern American species are found in Mexico exclusive of the plateau, the corresponding figures for the exclusively South American species being 14 and 50.
These differences are in agreement with Gadow's * The existing data for about 40 Mexican species would seem to show that their northern boundary line may correspond with the upper hmit of the Upper Sonoran of Merriam (Map in Bull.
10, U. S. Dept.
Agric, Div.
Biol.
Surv., 1S9S) in California, Arizona and New Mexico; but not east of the last named, as in Texas these species are not yet known as far north as the upper limit of Merriam's Lower Sonoran.
* The Distrito Federal embraces much of the highest portion of the Mexican plateau, having an elevation of 7200-8000 ft. or 2200-24.50 m., and has been fairly well examined as regards its Odonate fauna, which numbers 21 species, etc.
Outside of Mexico and Central America, 6 of the 21 occur exclusively in Northern America and 2 of the 21 exclusively in South America, so that here the southern element is weak.

^ be m •a results for Reptiles and Batrachia: "The plateau seems to be a much more effective barrier to the southerners than is the descent into the hot lowlands to the northern creatures.
"* The West Indies lie within the same parallels of latitude as do Mexico and Central America.
The total number of species of Odonata found in those islands is about 91;^ 56 of these, or 61.5%, also occur in our present district.
The number of species common to both is likely to be increased by future explorations, especially as the Odonate fauna of Yucatan and British Honduras, the continental areas lying nearest to the West Indies, is very imperfectly known.
But, making use of the present figures, it is rather surprising that only 61.5% of the West Indian Odonata are found in Mexico and Central America, seeing that the prevalent winds on the east coast of the mainland are easterly (i.e., northeast, east and southeast).^" With such insects as the Odonata one might expect the winds to play an important part as means of dispersal."
The West Indian species not yet found in Mexico or Central America include a number of fair-sized and probably fair-flying species, e.g., Aphylla produda, Progomphus integer and serenus, Dythemis rufinervis, Scapanea frontalis, Macrothemis celceno, Celithemis eponina, etc.
The extent to which species common to the West Indies are found in some parts of Mexico and Central America is shown in Table 3.
The Endemic Genera and Species are summarized in Table 4, p. 468.
Of the genera listed in Table 4 as occurring in both Northern and South America, Hetcerina, Argia, Progomphus, Erythrodiplax, and perhaps Dythemis, are represented by a greater number of species in South America than in Northern America, and these genera are entirely, 8 Proc.

Lestes, Enallagma, Ischnura, Mshna, LiheUula and Sympetrum are almost or quite cosmopolitan, but are more abundant in the northern than in the southern hemisphere.
Of the seven endemic genera, Pseudostigma, Thaumatoneura and Paraphlebia are South American in their affinities; the other four are not so clear.
Adding together the 9 species of these three genera, the 56 endemic species of genera also occurring in South America but not in Northern America (Table 4), and the 70 non-endemic species found elsewhere exclusively in South America (Table 1), we have a total of 135 species, or 46% of the fauna, as being of distinctly southern relationships.
Similarly, adding the 12 endemic species of genera also occurring in Northern America, but not in South America (Table 4), to the 21 non-endemic species found elsewhere exclusively in Northern America (Table 1) we have a total of 33 species, or 11% of the fauna, as being of distinctly northern affiliations.
In the endemic as well as in the non-endemic species, therefore, the South American element^^ is much the strongest in Mexico and Central America as a whole.
"While the expression "South American element" has been used in these pages to designate those species found at the present time in South America also, there seems to be no evidence to decide whether such Odonata, or their ancestors, entered Mexico and Central America from the south, or whether South America received them from the former countries.
Probably only further discoveries of fossil Odonata will settle this question.

c3 ^-r^-r Arranging the subfamilies in the order of their percentages of endemic species, the series obtained is Cordulegasterinse {two species onl}^ 100%, Gomphinffi 85.7%, Agrionina?
72.2%, Calopteryginffi 47.8%, Lestinse 42.8%, Libellulina?
16%o, iEshninffi 13%.
The Cordulegasterinse, many Gomphinse, most Libellulinse and iEshninae have welldeveloped powers of flight.
Perhaps the great majority of the other three subfamilies are feebly-flying insects, yet some of their species appearing in the present faunal district are very widely distributed, e.g., Enallagma civile, Ischnura ramburi, Anomalagrion hastatum.
It is consequently impossible to account for the relative endemicity of the subfamilies by such general considerations.
If the relative endemicity of these groups is not always inversely proportional to the powers of flight, as these figures seem to indicate, and if nearly 40% of the West Indian Odonata are not to be found in Mexico and Central America in spite of favoring winds, the explanation of the present distribution of this group of insects may perhaps be found in the past distribution of land and water^^ in these regions.
Distribution of the Odonata within Limited Portions of Mexico and Central A:\ierica.
Table 2 and the remarks on the fauna of the Mexican plateau (page 463) have already illustrated this topic to some degree.
Table 5 gives the number of endemic species and of those common to the three countries whose Odonate fauna is best known.
Accepting the areas of Mexico (exclusive of Campeche, Yucatan and Baja California), of Guatemala and of Costa Rica as approximately 655,000," 63,000,15 ^nd 21,000 square miles (1,700,000, 164,000 and 54,000 square kilometres) respectively, it follows that, in proportion to its area, Costa Rica is much the richest coimtry of the three, both in its total number of species and its number of endemic species.

The State of Vera Cruz, lying exclusively on the Atlantic slope, extending through 5i degrees (17°-22° + ) of latitude and 18,000 ft. (5,487 m.) of altitude, and having an area of 29,210 square miles (75,654 square kilometres), has 118 species of Odonata.
The State of New Jersey, U. S. A., also bordering the Atlantic, reaching from 39° to 41° 15' N. and to ISOO ft. (550 m.) in elevation, and with an area of 7,815 square miles (20,241 square kilometres) possesses 111 species of Odonata.
Both areas have been examined by a number of collectors of these insects, and the results do not seem to favor the general belief in the richness of tropical countries in Odonata.
At least 9 species are common to the two areas: Hetcerina americana, Argia translata, Ischnura ramburi, Anomalagrion hastatum, Anax Junius, A. longipes, LibeUula auripennis (probably).
Pantola flavescens, Sijmpetrum corruphim.
As far as I am aware no data have been published showing a richer Odonate fauna in a limited period of time than that of the vicinity of Kent, Ohio, where Messrs. Osburn and Hine took 57 species between June 17 and 24 {Ohio State University Naturalist, I, pp.

Relations of the Odonate Fauna to Teaiperature.^' In Plate XXVI we have given a map of the distribution of mean annual temperatures in Mexico and Central America.^^ The topograph}^, presenting a high paramesial axis running northwest and southeast through the greater part of the district, has brought about the existence of parallel zones of temperature, decreasing in mean annual intensity from each coast line to the axis.
As a result the temperatures are not distributed latitudinally, but a high cool tract extends far '' It is not intended that the remarks here made on the relations of Odonate distribution to temperatvire, rainfall and other environmental factors are to be interpreted as sho-\\ing the Hmits wliich these factors set to the distribution of the insects in question.
Our knowledge of the areas occupied by the latter is still too imperfect to permit this.
We may be said to know where many species occur, but not where they do not occur.
1^ Mr. C. H. T. Townsend, in his papers "On the Biogeography of Mexico, Texas," etc.
(Trans.
Texas Acad.
Sci., Vols.
I and II, 1895 and 1897), has laid great emphasis on the difference between apparent and sensible temperatures, as obtained from dry and wet bulb thermometers respectively, liolding that only sensible temperatures can be used in biogeographical work (I.e., 1, pp.
89-90; II, pp.

I am indebted to Dr. C. C. Adams for calKng my attention to these two papers, which seem to have been omitted from the "Zoological Record."
to the south of Mexico, thence continued as a chain of ''islands" in the midst of lower and hotter lands.
Considering the zones of mean annual temperature in order, from the hottest to the coldest : Zone I (more than 30° C. = 86° F.) is doubtful, as stated in the explanation of the map; no species of Odonata are known to be restricted to the area supposed to constitute it.
Zone II (30°-25° C, 86°-77° F.) is continuous on the Atlantic, and also on the Pacific slope, for the entire length of its extent, from about 20° north latitude on the eastern, or 25° north on the western, coast of Mexico to South America.
The Atlantic and Pacific belts of this zone are connected at the Nicaraguan lakes and at the Isthmus of Panama.
This zone therefore offers a pathway for the extension, northward or southward, of species which find in it temperature conditions similar to those which prevail over large areas of South America.^® It actually possesses a larger nimiber (91) of species also found in South America than any other zone, although Zone III has 90 such species.
Zones II and III have respectively 48 and 47 species also found in the West Indies, larger numbers than for the other zones.
Peculiarities of Zone II are Perilestes (Costa Rica), Argiallagma (Guatemala), Telebasis 4 species, M etaleptohasis , Neoneura, Protoneura 5 species, NephepeUia and Rhodopygia, all genera found in South America and the West Indies.
Yucatan, Campeche and most of British Honduras lie within this zone, and these three have no endemic species.
Zone III (25°-20° C, 77°-68° F.), the Mexican Tierra Caliente of Hann,^° extends continuously southward from the Gulf States on the east, and from Arizona and California on the west, to southern Nicaragua, where it is interrupted by Zone II.
The Atlantic and Pacific belts are confluent from the southern part of the State of Puebla to the western part of Chiapas, and again for the southern part of Honduras and most of Nicaragua.
After its interruption in southern Nicaragua, this zone reappears in northwestern Costa Rica and extends almost to the Isthmus of Panama.
Zones III and IV possess an equal number (27) of species also found in Northern America, a larger number than for the other zones.
Characteristic for this zone are Philogenia (not north of Costa Rica), Palcemnema, Progomphus 3 species, Epigomphus 4 species, genera chiefly South American in their distribution.
'* The distribution of the Odonata by temperature zones in South America should also be considered here, but even the first steps in investigating the South American Odonata from this point of view have vet to be taken.

Zone IV (20°-15° C, 68°-59° F.), the Mexican Tierra Templada of Hann, embracing a large part of the United States, nowhere touches the coasts in Mexico or Central America, as Zones II and III do, but occupies a central position.
It consists in these countries of a Mexican portion, of rather greater area than that of the central plateau, and reaching to southern Puebla ; a mostly elongated and narrow strip in Guerrero and Oaxaca, some of the western parts of Chiapas, Guatemala and Honduras, with an arm into western Salvador; a number of small scattered areas in Honduras and a larger one in northern Nicaragua ; finally, an elongated strip in Costa Rica and Panama.
Representatives of Zone IV are Cordulegaster godmani, Mshna dugesi, Plaihemis suhornata, Lihelhda comanche, foliata, nodisticla and luctuosa, members of chiefly northern, or {.^shna) cosmopolitan, genera.
Zone V (15°-10° C, 59°-50° F.), the Mexican Tierra Fria of Hann, occurs in scattered areas in Sonora, Chihuahua, Durango, Zacatecas, and one of greater extent in the States of Hidalgo, Puebla, Tlascala and Mexico ; in western Guatemala and on some of the peaks of Costa Rica.
No Odonata are peculiar to this zone.
Zone VI (less than 10° C. = 50° F.) occurs only on the higher peaks of Mexico, Guatemala and Costa Rica; no Odonata have been reported as yet at or above the elevations corresponding to its lower limit in these countries.
Zones III, IV, V and VI may be compared to continents or islands, lying within a sea of Zone II, and each enclosed by a girdle of zones of lower numbers than itself.
Table 9 gives the distribution of the Odonata within these zones.
From Table 9 it results that the number of species confined to one zone only is 104, extending through two zones 99, extending through three zones 71, and through four zones 8.
Of all the zones.
III contains the greatest number of species, subspecies and varieties, viz.
: 222 as compared with 165 in II, 143 in IV, and 10 in V; it is also the richest in zonal endemic species, viz.
: 46, as compared with 40 in II and 18 in IV; and the richest in endemic Mexican and Central American forms, viz.
: 106, as compared with 60 in IV, 56 in II, 4 in V, and 3 in I.
The species, etc., which, outside of Mexico and Central America, are found exclusively in Northern America appear in the temperature zones of our district in the following numbers: IV 15, III 13, II 5, V4.
As our map (Plate XXVI) shows, zones IV and III are continuous from the United States into Mexico, so that they offer a pathway for the extension of species whose living conditions are 476 [Oct., 1=1 cc i^ 2 § a Q S a a; fa "-^ o o 1 fOIXM OOIM CO hCO ,_, I-lO CO ,_i •<* »c t(M COQ , •SF^ox (N j-((M (N Oi ^ Tfi co-Hio "cd'coc^ CO ^ cot1 •UAVou^jun ^ T)H(M '^ Tt< l-H 1-H (N 8UOZ ^ > ^ ^ -^ ^ > rH,-( (M ^ IC Tt^ l-H --1 > Id »-H O t^ i-( (M _ t^ O O T-H (M IC T-t ^O fTf CO >— 1 > CO ^ CO^(N (M ^ ^ 1 1 Zones '■' > ec-iofo iM IT 't o^o«: (N (N CO TiH rJ4 ?Ot<M CC ^rt TJHCS 3 1 1— 1 a \—t lOCC ■* i-H lO 05 c t^ CO 00 If r-H I— 1 1-1 CO ^CO § (N 1— 1 § o 1— 1 > w > 7 (M (M "* '^ ^ 1 „ CS| (M (M 1 t— 1 i-i ^_i ,_l ,_i 1— 1 hH > r3 t> CO T-H Tfl .-1 rH (M cc GC O >0 '^ (N "* ^ rH (N s CO COO CO.-HC ir (M ,_!

The Northern American species found in zones II and V are, in all cases, also found in III or IV, and hence can conceivably have descended or ascended from one or the other of the latter two.
Considering all the Mexican and Central American species, etc., occurring also (a) in South America, or (6) exclusively in South America and the West Indies, or (c) exclusively in South America, the order (according to the number of species) of the temperature zones in which they appear is always the same, viz.
: II, III, IV, I, V, the numbers of species being respectively: (a) 91, 90, 60, 4, 1; (6) 29, 29, 18, 0, 0; (c) 52, 51, 33, 4, 0.
Zone II as a pathway for the extension of the "South American element" has already been considered on page 474.
Some Anomalies in the Zonal Distribution.
— Since Zone II is the only zone continuously extending northward from South America, it is of importance to notice, as Table 9 shows, that of the 70 Mexican and Central American forms occurring elsewhere exclusively in South America, 16, or 23%, have not been detected in zone II in our faunal region.
Of the 131 species, etc., common to Mexico, Guatemala and Costa Rica, the great majority have been found in zone II at some point (and hence presumably occur in it at other points), although they may also inhabit other zones, but there are 28 exceptions.
Sixteen of the species, etc., of zones III and IV of Costa Rica are not found farther north, but 17 other species of the same zones and country do so extend, although the Costa Rican areas of these zones are discontinuous.
In spite of the isolation of zone IV in Guatemala, no species of Odonata are known to be restricted thereto, and species found there and not known to occur in any other zone than IV, such as Cordulegaster godmani and Libellula foliata, are also found in Mexico and in Costa Rica.
Sixty-two and 27 species, etc., of zones higher than II found in Mexico and Guatemala are not and are, respectively, found farther south, a discontinuity of zones III-V existing south of Guatemala.
Nine and 4 species, etc., of zones IV-V (but not lower) found in Mexico are not and are, respectively, found farther south.
Some conceivable explanations of these anomalies (suggested for future investigation) are: incompleteness of data on the present distribution; that temperature does not limit the inhabitable area of the species concerned, or that, limiting it, the species found in discontinuous parts of the same zone may at times, past or present, 31 have made their way from one separated area to another by their own powers of flight, perhaps aided by favorable winds; that zones III and IV may have been more continuous throughout the length of Mexico and Central America in Tertiary times, when higher elevations with consequent cooler temperatures prevailed over areas now low and hot, as a result of previous greater volcanic activity or orogenic revolution,^^ some of which latter causes have been invoked by botanists^^ to account for the distribution of the plants of this district.
That temperature is not the only factor in determining the distribution of the Odonata is shown by the fact that each of the zones II-IV, even when continuous over large areas, contains species of quite limited habitat within that zone.
Such are Perilestes fragilis, Argia wilsoni, gaumeri, popoluca, and cwpraurea, Argiallagma minutum and species of Protoneura in zone II; Hetcerina rudis, Argia percellulata, calida, harretti, rhoadsi and pocommia and Palcemnema desiderata in zone III; Hetcerina tolteca and Argia herberti in zone IV, Relations of the Odonate Fauna to Rainfall.
The existence of pools, lakes, or watercourses of sufficient constancy for the development of the aquatic larvse of the Odonata is dependent on the water supply (ultimately traceable to the precipitation) and on the factors which tend to prevent its loss by evaporation or by sinking into the soil.
These latter factors probably include frequency of winds and of clouds, sheltering vegetation and the relative porosity of the soil and underlying rocks.
The supply and conservation of the water of a given area have not only the direct effects of furnishing the necessary living medium for the Odonate larvse, but also, in a more indirect manner, must influence the supply of food for both larvse and adults through the existence of vegetation and through it of herbivorous insects and other animals.
The influence of these environmental conditions on the Odonate fauna has not yet been thoroughly investigated even in those parts of the earth for which the physical data have been accumulated.
For Mexico and Central America, where the collection of these data has been very limited (except at a few well-known localities), it is hardly possible at this time to attempt to correlate the facts of Odonate distribution even with those of precipitation.

merits of rainfall show a much greater anmial variation^^ than in the case of temperature, and a much longer series of observations is, therefore, needed to determine the approximate average rainfall than to ascertain the approximate mean annual temperature.
Since such series exist for very few places^* and the rainfall differs so much at nearby localities (as the data gathered by the authors quoted show), the endeavor to correlate the occurrence of certain species of Odonata with rainfall differences appears to be premature,^^ although it may be that precipitation has a more important influence on the distribution of these insects than has temperature.^^ The annual variation in rainfall, however, may bring about an annual variation in the local Odonate fauna — a possibility which suggests that a proper understanding of the insect fauna may be obtainable only from the same methods of accumulation of data as are practised by the meteorologists.
Mr. E. B. Williamson, as a result of his observations made while collecting in Guatemala, has suggested in correspondence that "The species [of Odonata] occurring at any location during the dry season are those species of widest distribution, or, in other words, local species are to be found in the height of the season. "
In testing this suggestion, the difficulty at once arises that we have no complete records of the Odonata occmring both in the wet and dry seasons at the same locality.
An absolute essential for the study of this and other problems connected with the seasonal distribution of these insects in our district is a series of continuous observations for at least twelve consecutive months in the same limited area.
Under the present conditions the best that can be done is to compare wet season captures at one point with dry season collections at the nearest similar station.

They have yielded respectively 26 dry season species and 17 wet season species; each has 6 endemic species {i.e., restricted to Mexico and Central America), one of which, with 7 non-endemic species, is found at both localities.
The single locality in all Mexico and Central America which has furnished the greatest number of species of Odonata is Atoyac, in Vera Cruz — 68.
At least 59 of these were taken in April and May (the specimens of the other 9 are undated), and of these 59, 17 are endemic in Mexico and Central America.
If we may judge from the rainfall figures published for the nearest point, Cordoba,^^ April and May, while not a part of the wet season in its stricter sense, may have a precipitation of 29-101 mm.

respectively, the total for the 3^ear being 2600-3200 mm.
On investigating the seasonal records for the 17 endemic species at other localities, it appears that they are by no means always confined to one limited portion of the year.
Gualan, Guatemala, lies in the rainfall zone of less than 1000 m.^^ The only rainfall records from anywhere in the vicinity appear to be those of Teculutan, Department of Zacapa, the monthly figures for 1902, from January to December respectively, being 1, 0, 1, 95, 70, 361, ?, 38, 83, 164, 17 and 2 mm.^'o Mr. Wilhamson collected 39 species at Gualan in Januar}^, 1905, 7 of which are restricted to Mexico and Central America.
At Los Amates, lying in the rainfall zone of 10002000 mm., in the same month and the following February, 35 specief:( were obtained, 6 being endemic in our district.
At Puerto Barrios, whose measured precipitation for three years, 1894-6, is 3096 mm., with no month below 50 mm.,^"^ 33 species were procured in December, 1904, and February and March, 1905, 7 of these being confined to Mexico and Central America.
Gualan has a well-marked dry season, which is much less distinct at Los Amates and absolutely, but not relatively, absent at Puerto Barrios.
Of the endemic species, three taken at Gualan (Argia tezpi, A. pipila, Pseudoleon superbus), three at Los Amates (Neoneura amelia, Protoneura remissa, Orthemis hiolleyi), and four at Puerto Barrios {Hetcerina miniata, Argia gaumeri, Neoneura paya, Protoneura amatoria) were not taken at either of the other " Sapper, Petermann's Mittheil., XLIII, map, 1897.

and fall far short of giving a complete picture of the Odonate fauna.
It is also clear, especially from the Cuernavaca list, where the same species appear at frequent intervals throughout the year, that a number of different, perhaps overlapping, broods must exist, as there is no reason for supposing that the life of an individual imago is prolonged for many months.
Rainfall and Odonata on the Atlantic and Pacific Slopes.
— Various authors^^ have remarked the greater abundance of species of animals, including insects, on the Atlantic than on the Pacific slope of Mexico and much of Central America.
Sumichrast {I.e., p. 5) has attributed the relative poverty of the Pacific slope of Tehuantepec and adjoining areas in birds to "the extreme dryness of the soil; to the scarcity of vegetation and of insect life; and to the duration of the \vinds from the northeast and southwest which there prevail with great violence."
Harrington^^ has concluded that for Central America, "The rainfall is greater on the Atlantic than on the Pacific side as two or three to one."
Table 11 gives the distribution of the Odonata on these sides and on the Mexican plateau for the whole of our district, from which it appears that the total nimiber of Atlantic slope species is 235 against 181 for the Pacific, a proportion of nearly 4 to 3.
Tables 6-8 (pages 471-473) give the proportions for Mexico, Guatemala and Costa Rica respectively as, approximately, 4 to 3, 4 to 2, 4 to 4^.
Neither the rainfall nor the Odonate fauna can be summarized bo briefly, however, as local conditions may cause both of these to vary.
Not only the map of Puga,^^ but also the publications of Sapper^^ and of Lottermoser^^ show as heavy a rainfall on parts of the Pacific slope of Mexico and Guatemala as on the Atlantic side.
The Odonate fauna of Altamira and Tampico, in Tamaulipas, numbers 40 specieathat of Tepic 42; for Jalapa, Vera Cruz, we know 24 species, for Guada; lajara 50; for the vicinity of the city of Vera Cruz, including Medellin, 32 Sumichrast, quoted by Lawrence (Bull.

In Pacific Guatemala the highest number recorded for one locality is 26 at Santa Lucia, which is exceeded at various stations on the Atlantic slope, but this latter has received much more attention from the collectors whose material is accessible.
Generally we may conclude that the hot moist areas of Mexico and Central America are tenanted by the greatest number of forms of Odonata, present information pointing to the richest areas as lying in temperature zone III and the higher parts of zone II, on the Atlantic slope, from the centre of the State of Vera Cruz southward, these areas having a heavy annual rainfall.
In this connection may be mentioned the suggestion of a possible 3' The terms "Atlantic" and "Pacific slopes" are here used in the wide sense as embracing : (a) in Mexico all the descending lands from the outUnes of tfie plateau, as sho^Ti on our map (Plate XXVI), to the Gulf of Mexico on the one side and to the Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Cahfornia on the other; (6) m Mexico south of the plateau and in Central America, as corresponding to the Atlantic and Pacific drainage areas respectively.
correlation between paleness of wing-veins and dryness of climate,^^ which seems to receive some support from Argia mcesta?^ and Enallagma civile ;^'^ but, on the other hand, appears to be negatived byspecimens of Enallagma prccvarum from many of the same localities which furnish E. civile.
^^ Whatever of a more exact character we learn in the future of the dependence of these insects on climatic conditions, we must conceive of the latter as operating in a manner which may be compared to the beating of the waves upon a shore.
A higher temperature and a more copious rainfall, together or singly, advance upward to a greater elevation or northward to a higher latitude, making possible the existence of certain species in the larval state where they were previously unknown.
The next year, or after several years, these favorable conditions retreat down the mountain slopes or southward along the coastal plains, and the species whose existence they permitted disappear from certain localities for a longer or shorter period of time until the necessary conditions are again established.^^ To demonstrate the correctness of this view such continuous observations at a number of stations as were mentioned above (page 479) are essential.
Relations of the Odonate Fauna to Vegetation Areas.
Dr. Charles C. Adams, whose recent researches have been directed chiefly to the detection of the relations of faunse to their physiographic surroundings, has suggested to me to endeavor to correlate the distribution of these insects with that of vegetation areas, the latter to serve as indices of the general physical features of the country.
In this attempt I have employed Dr. Karl Sapper's vegetation maps of Central America,^^ locating the various places at which the Odonata have been collected in his zones and tabulating the distribution of the species accordingly.
The results, save in a few instances to be mentioned shortly, have been unsatisfactory, as the great majority of species appear in several columns of the tabulation.

There is also a larger scale map for Guatemala only, dated 1894, in Petermann's Mittheil., Erganzungsband XXIV, species so tabulated, six (Hetcerina cruentata, Argia fissa, A. extranea, Acanthagrion gracile, Ischnura ramhuri var.

Twenty-four species {Hetcerina tricolor, H. macro-pus, Argia pidla, A. indicatrix, A. oenea, Enallagma caecum novce-hispanice, Telebasis salva, Leptohasis vaciUans, Uracis imhuta, Orthemis ferruginea, 0. levis, Erythrodiplax funerea, E. umbrata, E. ochracea, E. connata var.

j\Iore than thirty species (including such endemic forms as Cora marina, Heteragrion triCiUulare, Argia frequentula, Telebasis digiticollis, Neoneura amelia, Erpetogomphus viperinus, Brechmorhoga pertinax) are common to zones 2 and 4, but not to others.
This does not necessarilj^ mean that a correlation of Odonate species with vegetation formations does not exist.
It may be that slight local differences of too small an area to be shown on the maps employed, or that our data based solely on the imagos, not on the larvae, are responsible for its apparent absence.
"* The few instances, above referred to, in which some correlation seems to exist are those of certain Odonata occurring in the tropical and subtropical rainy forest areas, as the species of Protoneura, Paraphlebia, Argiallagma, Ephidatia and Nephepeltia, and, less certainly, of other genera of the legions Podagrion and Protoneura.
From the notes of collectors which have been quoted under the respective species*'^ it would also appear that members of the legion Pseudostigma are dwellers in forests,**^ although not necessarily wet forests. "
Those disposed to make further researches as to the existence of such correlations will doubtless find assistance in Senor Jose Ramirez' "La Vegetacion de Mexico" (Anales, Ministerio de Fomento, Repiib.

Table 9, page 476, in connection with the map (Plate XXVI), may be used as indicating not only temperature zones, but also the elevated or non-elevated character of the country in which Odonata have been found, the higher zone numbers corresponding to higher altitudes.
Zone II in Central America and in Mexico south of 20° N. Lat.
(25° N. Lat.
on the Pacific side) embraces all the low coast lands.
The highest point on the Atlantic slope of Mexico to which it attains appears to be Actopan,^^ in Vera Cruz (311 m.*^), whence it descends to sea-level south of Tuxpan, while on the Pacific slope it reaches 487 m. at the city of Colima^^ and sea-level north of Culiacan.
Its upper limit in Central America is about 270 m. North of zone II the coasts of Mexico fall in zone III, which, with the higher parts of zone II, includes everywhere the gradually ascending slopes of the central plateaus and mountain ranges to an elevation of about 1,160 m. in Central America, 1,560 m. at Oaxaca City, 1,000 m. at Mirador, Vera Cruz, 700 m. in Nuevo Leon and higher than this last in Sonora.
In zones IV and V the larger rivers arise, to descend (except in some parts of northern Mexico) through zones III and II to the sea.
Zone IV extends to an elevation of 2,050 m. in Central America, 2,200 m. in the southern part of the Mexican plateau, but to not above 1,2001,300 m. in places in New Mexico.
The only species which appear to be exclusively confined to the actual sea-coast are ^shna brevifrons, Erythrodiplax berenice nceva and Tramea longicauda var.
Libellula auripennis is chiefly a sea-coast species, but in Mexico, as in the United States, has been found elsewhere.
A larger number (16)^" of forms are not known to descend below the lower limits of zone IV and are, in our district, markedly highland species.
Such are Hetaerina tolteca, H. maxima, Cora skinneri, Lestes henshaioi, Argia terira, herberti, chelata and tonto, Progomphus obscurus borealis, Cordulegaster godmani, >Eshna dugesi, Plathemis subornata, Libellula comanche, foliata, nodisticta and luctuosa.

*° The apparent discrepancy between tliis figure (16) and that to be obtained (19) from Table 9, page 476, is due to the fact that the three other species or varieties, Anax longipes and Erythrodiplax connata a' and c' , while as yet found only in zone IV in Mexico and Central America, have been taken at lower levels in South America or in the West Indies.
in some cases restricted apparently to a single locality (Hetasrina rudis), in others having a wide range of elevation, as from the seacoast to the central plateau (Anomalagrion hastatum, Ceratura capreola).
Where the same species of Ischnura has been found at quite different altitudes, a slight increase in body size and in the number of postcubitals has heen detected in specimens from the higher stations.

It slioiikl be added that the existence of zone I, with a mean annual temperature of more than 30° C, rests solely on the authority of the map of Senties and Reyes, that it is doubted by Seiior Pastrana, and that I have not succeeded in finding any records of temperature observations in the valley of the Rio de las Balsas for a period of more than two months.
For Central America, the temperature records quoted in the paper in the Monthly Weather Review, above mentioned, indicate that in Guatemala and Costa Rica the annual isotherms of 25°, 20°, 1.5°, 10° and 5° C. are situated approximately at elevations of 270, 1,160, 2,050, 2,9.50 and 3,840 metres respectively.
The present map, so far as Central America is concerned, has been made from the topographical maps of Dr. Sapper (Petermann's Mittheilungen, L, 1904, and Erqanzungshander XXVII and XXXII, 1S99 and 1905; and Mittelamerikanische Reisen und Studien, Braunschweig, 1902) and of the Bureau of American Republics for Guatemala (1902), Nicaragua (1903) and Costa Rica (1903), by using these equivalents.
A EEVIEW OF THE GENUS PIAYA Lesson.
BY WITMER STONE.
While rearranging the Cuckoos in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences my attention was attracted to the type specimen of Piaya macroura Gambel.
The apparent omission of this species from Dr. Bowdler Sharpe's Hand List of Birds led me to make a critical study of the genus, the results of which are embodied in the present paper.
I am under obligations to the United States National Museum through Dr. Charles W. Richmond, and to the American Museum of Natural History through Mr. Frank M. Chapman, for the loan of large series of specimens of the genus, without which my investigation would not have been possible.
The material loaned by these institutions, together with that in the Academy's Museum, numbers 259 specimens distributed as follows: Mexico, 64; Central America, 59; Panama, 13; Colombia, 26; Venezuela, 18; Ecuador, 8; Brazil, 32; Guiana, 6; Bohvia, 2; Peru, 4; Paraguay, 2; Trinidad, 8.
The genus Piaya includes two very well-marked species, P. melanogastra and P. rutilus, and a number of alhed geographic races which have generally been combined under the name P. cayana.
The first two offer but few difficulties, and it is the cayana group that has caused confusion in the nomenclature of the genus.
The forms of Piaija caijana may be roughly divided into three groups according to the color of the upper surface.
In group (1) it is bright ferruginous t (2) bay inclining to chestnut; (3) walnut brown tinged with chestnut.
Beginning at the northern part of the range of the genus, we have in western Mexico a large form of the ferruginous group (mexicana), while in eastern Mexico, extending throughout Central America and Panama, is a totally different form of the chestnut-backed group (mehleri).
The individuals are quite uniform over this large area, with the exception of the size of the bill, which is smaller in Mexican and Yucatan birds than in those from Nicaragua and Costa Rica.
In the Cauca river valley of Colombia is a slightly different form (caucce), in which the flanks as well as the crissum are black, this 1 All colors are based on Ridgway's nomenclature of colors.
color encroaching farther upon the gray abdomen than in any other form.
In northeastern Colombia (Santa Marta to Bogota) and the western portion of Venezuela is a light bird of the ''ferruginous" group (columbiana) , practically identical with the form of western Mexico except for its much larger bill.
Farther east, from the Orinoco valley throughout Guiana, is another of the chestnut-backed forms (cayana), similar to that from Central America, while to the southwest is still another (nigricrissa) , ranging over eastern Colombia through Ecuador and Peru.
Both of these differ from the Central American bird in dimensions and in the almost total lack of brown on the under surface and the tail which is uniform black, while the Guiana form differs further in having gray under-tail coverts instead of dull black.
On the island of Trinidad is a diminutive ferruginous-backed bird (insulana), otherwise similar to the Central American form.
In southern Brazil, from Bahia and Matto Grosso, is a larger very pale bird (pallescens) of the ferruginous type.
In Paraguay, and doubtless in parts of Argentina and southern Brazil, occurs the largest form of all (macroura), with a different coloration from any of the more northern races, the back being walnut brown tinged with chestnut.
In Bolivia and southern Peru is a smaller race of this same style of bird (boliviana), difieiing further in its gray instead of black under-tail coverts.
Three of the races of Piaya cayana seem to have been described by early non-binomial authors.
Hernandez's Quapactotl being in all probability the east Mexican bird, while Brisson's Cuculus cayenensis is undoubtedly the form from Cayenne and Azara's Tingazu the very large dark bird of Paraguay.
Linnseus established Brisson's bird in binomial nomenclature as Coccyzus cayanus and Gmelin gave the name.
Coccyzus ridibundus to the Quapactotl of Hernandez, quoting the original more or less indefinite description, as was done also by Ray, Buffon and Latham, the last of whom designated it as the Laughing Bird.
Later Stephens inadvertently changed Gmelin's name to rubicundus, but added nothing to the original diagnosis.

L. 16 ins.
Tail half the length of the body.
Hab., Nova Hispana " — seems not clearly identifiable, although it is added to the synonymy of Piaya cayana by Capt.
Shelly without' question in Vol.
XIX of the British Museum Catalogue of Birds, where all these forms are lumped under the above name.
Vieillot, in 1817, gave the name macrocercus collectively to the 32 P. cayana of Linnaeus and allied forms, several of which were described but not named.
Swainson, 1827, named the light-colored western Mexican bird mexicana, and 1837 modified Linnaeus' name cayanus into cayennensis, which was the form in which it had been used by Brisson.
Gambel, 1849, described the large Paraguay bird as Piayamacroura, but erroneously credited his specimen to Surinam, as pointed out by Cabanis {Mus.
Hein., IV, p. 87).
Dr. J.
A. Allen (Bull.
Amer.
Mus.
Nat.
Hist., V, p. 137, 1893) correctly states that Gambel regarded P. cayana L. and P. mexicana as identical, but his description of macroura could never apply to cayana as Dr. Allen claims.
Gambel states that the crissum is black and the length of tail is 15 inches, while P. cayana has a gray crissum and a tail only 9.50 inches in length (Dr. Allen's measurement) !
Bonaparte, 1850, also describes the large Paraguay bird as P. circe from a specimen erroneousl}^ recorded as from Colombia (error in locality also pointed out by Cabanis, I.e.)
and describes as new another bird, P. mehlerijirom Bogota.
This name has caused much trouble to subsequent authors.
For a time it was used for the small form occurring from southeastern Colombia to Ecuador and Peru.
Then Dr. Sclater examined the type in the Paris Museum and stated (P. Z. S., 1860, p. 285) that it was identical with the east Mexican and Central American bird, claiming that the type locality must have been wrong.
Subsequently Dr. Allen and also Mr. Hartert (Nov.
Zool., V, 499) have used the name again for the Ecuador bird, and it so stands in Sharpe's Hand List.
The examination of the type ought to settle a c^uestion of this kind, and I can see no reason why Dr. Sclater's statement should be ignored.
Cabanis' review of the genus (Mus.
Hein., IV, p. 82, 1862) is a remarkably accurate piece of work.
He describes as new the well-marked forms pallescens, guianensis and columbianus, and clearly diagnoses as distinct mexicanus Swainson, macrourus Gambel, nigricrissa Sclater, cayana Linn, and mehleri Bon.
His new species mesurus, however, seems not separable from his columbianus.
In Dr. J.
A. Allen's brief review of the genus (Bull.
Amer.
Mus.
Nat.
Hist., V, p. 136, 1893) he falls into several errors, largely through lack of material, having no specimens of the light colored bird of northern Colombia and Venezuela, nor of the very large dark form from Paraguay.
He ignored Cabanis' exlpanation of the true nature of Gambel's macroura, making it a synonym of cayana in spite of the discrepancies in size and color; and then identified the macroura of Cabanis with his new race cabanisi, a pale bird differing only slightly in measurements from pallescens Cab., from which it does not seem separable.
As a matter of fact macroura and " cahanisi" differ more in color than do mexicana and mehleri, which Dr. Allen regarded as the most distinct of any of the races.
Dr. Allen used Bonaparte's name mehleri for the Ecuador bird, apparently overlooking Sclater's statement, but he rightly surmised that the Bolivian birds were separable, though he allied them to the Ecuador form instead of to macrowra, to which they are closely related.
P. dree Bon., correctly referred to macroura by Cabanis, is doubtfully referred to mehleri by Dr. Allen.
Hellmayr {Nov.
Zool., XIII, p. 43) describes as new the Trinidad bird, calling it insulana, and gives a good resume of the several forms recognized by him.
He here distinguishes guianensis from cayana, although he later regards them as not separable; he also adopts Dr. Allen's cabinisii for the big dark colored macroura, apparently overlooking the fact that Dr. Allen's bird, which ''differs little in color from pallescens," could hardly have the ''crissum black," Von Ihring {Revista Museo Paulista, 1904, p. 448) recognizes Allen's error in writing P. macroura and P. cabanisi and again renames the former var.
yuarania.

This bird was first described by Brisson as Cuculus cayanensis minor, and is entered by Linnaeus and Gmelin as var.
/?
under Cuculus cayanus.
Gmehn also adds a description of a var.
y, which from its 'capite cinereo' must be Piaya melanogaster.
Illiger (1812) regarded these as sexes of the same species and gave them the name Cuculus rutilus, while Spix (1824) did the same thing, calling them Macropus caixana.
The figure and description of his female ( = melanogaster) is defective in that he does not give the abdomen as black; furthermore he showed by a query that he was not sure whether this was the same species as the smaller bird, therefore his name must unquestionably be restricted to the latter.
lUiger's name could be allotted to either bird , but as the smaller one, var.
«, stands first, and as it was not subsequently named minutus until after the name melanogaster was proposed for var.
r, I think rutilus should be used for 'var.
a,' currently known as Piaya minuta.
Piaya cayana.
Common characters.
Above some shade of ferruginous, bay or wahiut brown, rectrices and remiges with more or less wine purple gloss, tips of remiges dusky, rectrices tipped with white with a subterminal black bar above; central pair usually rusty beneath, others varying from rusty to black in the various races, the white tips always distinct, the subterminal band present or absent, lower surface of body pale gray, thighs sometimes and crissum always darker, throat and breast vinaceous cinnamon.
The races vary in the color of the upper parts and of the lower side of the tail, as well as in the color of the crissum; the latter, however, is not always constant.
There is also marked difference in size, and in the proportions of the bill.
The extremes of coloration are seen in fresh specimens of P. columhiana, nigricrissa and macroura, which on the upper surface are respectively ferruginous, bay and walnut brown of Ridgway's Nomenclature of Colors.
The relationship of the other forms, so far as the color of the upper parts is concerned, is shown below: P. c. Columbiana, ferruginous.
P. c. mexicana, ferruginous.
P. c. pallescens, ferruginous, a trifle paler.
P. c. insulana, ferruginous, a trifle darker.
P. c. nigricrissa, bay.

Mr. Hartert at one time {Nov. ZooL, XIII, p. 43) regarded this as a distinctive character separating the bird of French Guiana from that ranging from Dutch Guiana through the Orinoco valley (P. c. guanensis), but later (XIV, p. 35) he considers the difference not constant, in which opinion I heartily agree.

This bird is indistinguishable from mexicana above, and differs below only in the greater amount of black shading on the rectrices ; the greatest difference is found in the much larger bill.
Bogota specimens have a still greater amount of black on the under side of the rectrices.

Upper parts similar to columbiana but paler, the bright ferruginous modified by a tone of ochre; crissum and thighs paler than in colombiana, and abdomen paler than in any other race, under side of rectrices nearly uniform rusty brown except for the white tips; the pale rusty tint usually pervades the whole dark area instead of forming definite patches, in some lights, however, the dusky subterminal bands are clearly discernible.
.g[I have studied Dr. Allen's series of cabanisi from Chapada, Matto Grosso, and cannot find sufficient difference between them and birds from more northern Brazilian localities to w^arrant separation from pallescens.
Five specimens of the latter give average length of wing 5.90 and tail 11.30, while ten Matto Grosso birds give wing 6, tail 12.
These differences are less than those shown by series of mehleri from different parts of its range and since, as Dr. Allen admits, there are practically no color differences, there seems to be no ground for recognizing cabanisi as distinct.
Dr. Allen was misled by the general recognition accorded to the more southern macroura, to which he thought his bird must be referred, and which he thought required a new name.
Specimens examined from Chapada, Matto Grosso, Corumba, Matto Grosso, Bahia, Para and Rio Janeiro.
The Para specimen approaches cayana, while those from Rio Janeiro are darker, showing a possible tendency toward macroura.

The Committee on tlie Hayden Memorial Award reported as follows : The Committee on the Hayden Memorial Geological Award reports in favor of conferring the medal this year on John Mason Clarke, State Geologist of New York, in recognition of the value of his work in geology and especially of his memoir, Early Devonic History of New York and Eastern North America.
In the opinion of the Committee he ranks with the others who have received the recognition.
(Signed) Henry Fairfield Osborn, R. A. F. Penrose, Jr., Amos P. Brown, Frederick Prime, Samuel G. Dixon, Committee.
John Mason Clarke was born at Canandaigua, N. Y., April 15, 1857.
His early education was received in the Canandaigua Academy, of which his father was principal.
In 1877 he graduated from Amherst College and studied in the University of Gottingen from 1882 to 1884.
For a period he taught at the Canandaigua Academy and the Utica Academy and in 1879 was instructor in geology at Amherst.
From 1880 to 1882 he was professor of geology and zoology at Smith College, and in 1885 lecturer on geology at the Massachusetts Agricultural College.
In 1886 he was appointed assistant in paleontology under Prof. James Hall, State geologist of New York; in 1892 assistant State geologist and paleontologist; in 1898 State paleontologist; in 1904 State geologist and paleontologist, director of the State Museum and the Science division of the Education department; in 1894 he was made professor of geology and mineralogy in the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
In 1908 the Iroquois Nation received him into their membership as keeper of their historic archives with the ancient title of this office.
His scientific publications, chiefly on geology and paleontology, and extending over a period of thirty years, are somewhat voluminous, and, though largely relating to the State of New York, include also parts of Canada, Maine, South America and Germany.
His most comprehensive treatises are The North American Devonian Crustacea (1888), Introduction to the Study of the Genera of the Paleozoic Brachiopoda (1892 and 1894), and The Paleozoic Reticidate Sponges (1898), all published in titular conjunction with James Hall; The Naples Fauna (1899 and 1904), The Early Devonic of New York and Eastern North America (1908).
In addition to numerous other papers on problems in geologyhe has also written on ceramics.
He received the degrees of A.M. and Ph.D. {honoris causa) from the University of Marburg in 1898; LL.D.
from Amherst, 1902.

The following were ordered to be printed : ON THE CICINDELIN^ OF ANGOLA.
BY F. CREIGHTON WELLMAN, IVI.D., F.E.S., AND WALTHER HORN, M.D.
Very little has been known until now about the Cicindelinse of Angola.
Most of the species described are represented by uniques or a few specimens, excepting, of course, those occurring in other parts of Africa.
The discovery of the "typical" Angolan forms is almost entirely connected with the names of four collectors, namely: Friedrich Welwitsch, the distinguished Austrian botanist who collected for the Museum of Lisbon;.
A. v. Hohmeyer and Dr. P. Pogge, whose collections now belong to the Royal Zoological Museum of Berlin, and Major von Mechow, whose specimens are at present in the collection of Rene Oberthiir.
These last were described by Quedenfeldt, Sr., Harold worked up the material for the Berlin Museum, and Putzevs pubhshed concerning the Portuguese collections.
Beyond these only a few species, mostly based on single specimens and some without exact localities, have from time to time been sent to Europe, most of them described by one of the authors of the present paper (W. H.).
While not less than six genera in thirty-five species^ are known from this so highly interesting part of Africa, yet this is the first time that large material with exact bionomical notes has become available — material which permits of a distinct advance in our knowledge of this interesting family.
It seems, therefore, a suitable opportunity to present our notes on the habits and relations of the species occurring in Angola, and we have made the list complete by including the species reported by other observers as well as ourselves.
One very peculiar and interesting new form is described.
In taking up a faunistic study of this kind it is always interesting to note the general features of the climate, soil and flora of the region discussed, as these must always have a bearing on the habits and distribution of its animal life.
For the purposes of this paper our district may be divided into three regions : lowlands, mountainous slopes, and ' Twenty species of these were taken in Angola bv one of us (F. C. W.) during 1906-08. plateau.
The first of these extends from the sea to a point 30 to 100 miles inland, according to the configuration of the country, and its most typical plant may be said to be the cocoanut palm, which will grow wherever moisture enough is obtainable.
The soil is over parts of this belt strongly calcareous, being of recent geological formation, abounding in various fossils such as anamonites and trilobites.
Other parts are the result of silt being carried down by erosion of the older interior mountains.
The rainfall in this part is very scanty, as the storms come from the east and are intercepted by the highlands and mountains, only the heaviest and most general rains for a small portion of the year reaching the lowlands to the west.
The vegetation is in consequence sparse, consisting of a few shrubs and thorny or fleshy trees.
The grass grows in little discrete clumps and dries up and almost disappears during the greater part of the year.
In this region only five species of Cicindelinae were encountered: Cicindela brevicollis intermedia Klug, C. melancholica F., C. nitidula Dej., C. cdbinda Bat.
and Eurymorpha cyanipes mouffleti Fairm., the last three of which occur on the seashore.
The second region may be said to extend inland from the first region to a point marked by the limits of the occurrence of the baobab tree (Adansonia digitata).
The basis of this is a vast primary system, consisting of various metamorphic rocks, chiefly granite and sandstone.
The soil is a sandy loam alternating with red clays.
Of course, there is a great mixture of soils in the lower levels and valleys of this region.
Huge granite mountains and boulders abound.
The vegetation is very dense in canons and valleys and along rivers, -..and in the rainy season the grass is often long, coaree and deixse, forming a sort of jungle.
Many large trees (Anonacese, Anacardacese, Guttiferse, etc.)
abound in the jungles near streams.
The most inland valleys of this region have a flora approaching that of the highland region yet to be described, and it was here that most of the species discussed in this paper were taken, our specimens including Cicindela Mechowi Qued., C. lutaria W. Horn, C. saraliensis Guer., C. uncivittata Qued., C. infuscata Qued., C. Putzeijsi W. Horn, C. angusticollis Boh., C. villosa Putz.. C. flavipes Putz., C. Wellmani W. Horn, C. reticostata n.
sp., Odontochila erythropyga Putz., Cosmema Wellmaiii W. Horn, C. marginepunctata W. Horn, C. auropunctata Qued., etc.
The climate of this region is intermediate between that of the foregoing and that of the region about to be described, being cooler and moister than the lowlands, without equalling in these respects the highlands.
The third region is the high plateau forming the Bihe and parts of the Bailundo and Andulo countries.
This is part of the alpine region of Africa, and is to be classed with Abyssinia, Ruenzori and the NyassaTanganyika highlands.
The soils are about as in the middle region and the country is, geologically speaking, very old, being entirely underlaid with archaean metamorphic rocks.
The grass is comparatively short and thickly set together, quite covering the ground.
The bulk of the trees are Leguminosae and are as a rule not large, forming what is known as "bush."
One of the Rosaceae (Paranarium mohola) is the largest and most striking tree.
Many IMalvacese and Ampelidae add to the smaller aspects of the landscape.
The cUmate is moist and cool and is essentially subtropical and not tropical.
The species found in the center of this last region are Cicindela suturalis Putz., C. Mechowi Qued., Ophryodera rufomarginata Boh., and Mantichora congoensis" P6r.
At the western border of this region, almost at a point where it joins the second region (vide supra) were taken several other species, namely: Cicindela angusticollis Boh., C. uncivittata Qued., C.infuscata Qued., C. Putzeysi W. Horn, C. fiavipes Putz., C. villosa Putz.
and Cosmema auropunctata Qued.
Following is a list of all recorded species^ from Angola, including our own material, much of which is here reported for the first time, together with our notes on the habits of the beetles and the description of a new species.

Several forms occur, with and without white sutural stripe, both brownish and green.
These beetles appeared to be very scarce until a large artificial bare place was prepared, when mechowi and several other species appeared in great numbers.
The brownish form usually appears on clayey soil.
When alive they have a strong verbena-like smell.
They are strong flyers and very pugnacious.
A specimen kept over night in a cage with some other beetles was found next morning chewing the thorax of a Meloid beetle {Eletica rufa F.).

(sine labro).
A single 6^ from the Enyalanganja or great plains, 3 hours south of the Ekuiva River, November, 1907 (Wellman).
It is one of the most peculiar species of the whole genus, belonging to the interesting laeta-quadristriata group, reported only from the tropics of Africa.
The labrum is black with a testaceous patch in the middle, the 3 middle teeth are just a little less prominent than the lateral tooth.
Front and pronotum are roughly and deeply wrinkled.
The sutural angle of the elytra is rectangular without a developed spine.
All tarsi, as in Cicindela quadristriata, sulcated.
The 1st, 3d and 4th articles of the antennae are on their upper part slightly carinate.
The size, color and sculpture of this species, and especially its movements, lend it when alive the appearance of a Carabid.
It did not attempt to fly when pursued, although it was in bright sunshine.

This species occurs almost entirely on feldspathic soil, against which its indistinct light-colored markings make it almost impossible to see, except when it is in motion.
It was only taken once or twice on red or dark soil, but one could count on finding it in abundance as soon as a bit of whitish soil rich in kaolin was reached.

Ent.
Zeitschr., 1900, p. 207.
Kakonda; Chiyaka, November, 1906; Ekuiva River, 1907 (Wellman).
This reddish species almost always occurred on clayey soil, and usually together with C. mechowi {vide supra) In Chiyaka it was taken on the artificial bare place made for the purpose of attracting Cicindelidae.
A pecuhar point noted is that this beetle jumps and flies like a small grasshopper which is always found with it.
On one occasion a large Asilid fly was observed to catch a specimen of C. putzeysi.

Three forms occur: coppery, green and blackish.
It was noted that the coppery form occurred in the valleys on clayey soil, together with Cicindela mechovn, and C. putzeysi, while the green form was taken on the mountain sides among moss, etc., in company with Odontochila erythropyga (vide supra).

In conclusion : there are still two species of Cicindela known in tropical Africa, and very common to the north, east and south of Angola, which almost surely occur in Angola itself, although not yet found there, namely, Cicindela nilotica Dej.
and C. dongalensis imperatrix Srnka.
It is also probable that the common Cicindela regalis Dej., which is widespread in the regions to the north, east and southeast of the district here discussed, will be one day reported from Angola.
Cicindela cincta Fabr., the common species reported from the mouth of the Senegal to Bahral-Ghazal and the Kassai, may likewise touch the boundaries of Angola somewhere.
