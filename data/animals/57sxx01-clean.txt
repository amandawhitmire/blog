ANNOTATED LIST OF THE TYPES OF INVERTEBRATE CRETACEOUS FOSSILS BY CHARLES W. JOHNSON.
The following list of types and figured specimens was made during 1902.
Leaving Philadelphia early the following year I have been unable until the present time to verify some of the notes on synonymy etc.
No attempt has been made to fully work out the synonymy so that only the published synonyms bearing on the types are given usually where recent generic changes have been adopted.
The generic position of many of the species is doubtful as they are based on casts often lacking essential characters the grouping of some of the species in families is therefore only provisional.
Although a very thorough study was made of all the cretaceous material a few types which should be in the collection are missing.
I have not recorded these as they may be found upon further search.

In the drawer containing the Gabb collection above referred to I found the types of this species which were not studied by Prof. Wliitfield when writing his monograph.

The two folds on the columella are very distinct.
The specimen figured by Wliitfield pi.

Not having the types of this species probably led Prof. Whitfield to describe the type of A. ovoidea Gabb as a new species  Actoeon suhovoides although the original label was present.
Both of Gabb's species arc well described and in the true types all the characters in the original descriptions are clearly shown.

With the specimen there is an original label in Gabb's handTiting  Sti'aparolus deplanatus Gabb Cretaceous Ala. On the specimen is wTitten the word '' type.
This seems to be a good species the characters of which are well shown in the figure referred to.
It is more depressed than S. lapidosus the body whorl being almost uniforml rounded above and below.
While practically an internal cast the spire still has some of the shell altered to calcite remaining which shows a slight crenulation below the suture.
The specimen evidently came from Prairie Bluff Alabama.
I have been unable to find a description.

A CONTKIBUTION TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORTHOPTERA OF SOUTH AND CENTRAL FLORIDA.
BY JAIES A. G. REHX AND MORGAN HEBARD.
The material on which the following study is based is almost entirely the property of the junior author the greater portion having been collected by him on trips taken in the months of January and February 1903 and 1904.
The localities represented are Tampa Hillsboro county Chokoloskee and Key West Momoe county and Miami Dade county.
The specimens examined number 783 the species seventyeight of which seven are new and several Cuban types are here recorded from the United States for the first time.
A Aery representative series of the material has been presented to the Acadenw.
The field notes given after the species are entirely the work of the junior author and are followed by the initial of his name.
The brief descriptions of the localities visited with other facts of interest from the standpoint of this paper are also by him.
Tampa Hillsboro County Florida.
During my brief stay in Tampa January 16 and 17 1904 I had time for only a few expeditions and found that from the Tampa Bay Hotel good collecting grounds were not easy to reach.
Chilly weather also hampered me decidedly as in South Florida the weather had been so cool that Orthoptcra was scarce except in the most sheltered places.
There are many marshy spots along the shore of Tampa Bay and in these few specimens of Orthoptera were to be found.
In the driftwood along the shore I also captured a few Forficulids and Blattids and noticed a small cricket of a pale straw color which I was unable to capture.
Back from the bay the country is flat and for the greater part open with frecuent shallow ponds around the edges of which the grasses grow rank and in these I took numerous specimens.
The occasional woods of scattering pines proved unproductive at this time of year but along their borders the dead pine stumps yielded a number of Eurycotis floridana.
A vacant lot near the hotel yielded in addition a few specimens of Ncmohius.
30 proceedings of the academy of jan. Key West Monroe County Florida.
I arrived at Key West on January 18 at 4 P.M. and loft on the 20th but during this time I collected every spare moment and although the Key was dry and a high wind kept the white coquina dust flying in clouds collecting proved quite productive.
During the fall months the collecting must be of the best.
Key West is one of the numerous small islands off the Florida coast and is situated on the edge of the Gulf Stream ninety miles northeast of Havana Cuba.
The surface of the Key is composed almost wholly of coquina and is perfectly flat.
The greater part is covered with a dense scrub growing to a height of from fifteen to twenty feet in which very few Orthoptera could be found.
The lagoons extending along parts of the shore were also improductive but there are a few portions of the island near tlie city where the country is more open and the scrub is interspersed with occasional gumbolimbo trees and in such location the collecting was excellent.
Here not only was Acrididas abundant in the grass but I also found the Blattidse and Forficulidse abundantly represented under the loose chunks of coquina.
I noticed many immature Gonatista grisea scurrying about on the gumbolimbo trees and at their roots captured several Anisomorpha buprcstoides.
Here and there are small shallow ponds around the edges of which peculiar weeds flourish on the bare coquina.
Miami Dade County Florida.
I spent several weeks in Miami in the winter of 1903 but did no collecting of any importance in Orthoptera until February 1904 when I was there from February 5 to February 9 and found Orthoptera plentiful.
Near the town there are four different localities in which to collect the thick jungle or hammock the open pine woods the salt marshes and the Everglades.
In the hammock most insects are abundant but Orthoptera are scarce.
I took several species here on the weeds under the bark of the oaks and in the small open spaces.
The open pine woods are filled with Orthoptera and many species were to be found among the low vegetation and pine needles.
The dead pine logs upon their bark being peeled off also disclosed several interesting species.
These pine woods extend along Biscayne Bay between the Everglades and the hammocks along the shore.
The salt marshes are to be found here and there along the shore of the bay but are quite distant from the hotel and owing to the shortness of my stay I was unable to visit them.
The Everglades are so difficult to penetrate that I found it impossible to collect there.
Along their edge no Orthoptera could be found.
Many species of Orthoptera were to be heard in the grounds of the Hotel Rojal Palm after dark and I made a number of interesting captures there.
During the summer of 1903 Mr. W. S. Dickinson collected for me in this locality and reported Orthoptera to be scarce in most places.
The material from Chokoloskee Monroe county was purchased and therefore I can give no notes for it.
Family FORFIOULID.
labidura bidens Olivier.
A single small male of this species is contained in the Miami collection taken July 11 1903.
It is considerably smaller and lighter than males from Thomasville Georgia and has the anal segment almost unarmed.
Anisolabis maritima Bon..
A female of this species from Key West taken January 19 1904 and another from Miami taken February 9 1904 have been examined.
Key West.
 This specimen was taken from under a coquina boulder which also disclosed a number of Ariisolabis annulipes.
H. Miayni.
 Taken from a stone wall.
H. Anisolabis annulipes H. Lucas.
A series of fiftythree specimens from Miami taken during the summer of 1903 and a Key West series of nineteen taken January 19 1904 represent this species.
Considerable variation exists in the width and intensity of the femoral annuli and in some specimens they are almost wholly lacking.
Key West.
 All of these specimens were taken from under coquina boulders along a new road being built on the outskirts of the town.
They were found several at a time often in company with one or two large scorpions.
H. Labia burgessii Scudder.
Nine specimens from Tampa taken January 17 1904 and fourteen from Miami taken February 6 1904 are identical with specimens from Thomasville Georgia Specimens from both localities were taken from under the bark of dead pine logs those from Miami all being taken from the same log.
H Labia guttata Scudder.
A single female of this species was taken at Tampa January 17 1904 Taken from under a sign on an oak in company with a number of Periplaneta australasicc .
H. Family BLATTID.
Blattella germanioa Linureus.
Four specimens of this species from Iiami have been examined.
Blattella adspersicollis Stal.
Four specimens of this West Intlian and tropical American species have been examined from Miami taken February 6 1903 and February 1 1904.
This is the first record of the species within the United States.
The specimen captured on February 6 1903 I took on the porch of the Hotel Royal Palm in the early morning.
All the others were found under signs on the pine trees in the town.
H. Ceratinoptera lutea Saussure and Zehntner.
An adult was taken at Tampa in the driftwood along the shore of Tampa Bay on January 17 1904 and one in Key West on January 20 1904.
The specimen taken at Tampa was so recently emerged from the larval state that it had not then become hardened.
H. Temnopteryx deropeltiformis Brunner.
An adult female of this species was taken at Miami on the 5th of August 1903.
This record considerably extends the range of the species Indiana being the only State from which it has previously been recorded.
Brunner's original description merely credited the species to North America.
Eurycotis floridana Walker.
This illsmelling species is represented liy a series of twentyeight individuals in all stages of development thirteen being adult.
Tampa specimens were taken January 16 1904 Key West individuals on January IS and 19 1904 and Iiami representatives on Feliruary 6 1904 and July 1 and August 11 1903.
The greater portion of the immature individuals are of the sabaliana type with the lateral margins lightcolored.
In some specimens this is quite marked in others very obscure and in a number absent two adults are noteworthy as retaining indistinct traces of this early color pattern.
I found this species moderately common under the bark of dead pine stumps and logs both at Tampa and Miami.
In Key West it fairly swarmed under the coquina boulders in the woods one rock often disclosing a dozen the greater part immature but ranging from tiny young to huge females bearing large oothecse.
All would immediately scuttle away making a rustling sound in the loose pebbles.
When seized these insects emit a vilesmelling oily fluid.The females always produced far more of this than the males.
H. Periplaneta americana Linnaeus.
This species is represented by an adult female and four immature individuals taken at Tampa January 17 1904.
Periplaneta australasise Fabricius.
Three adults from Miami taken July 11 and 21 and August 23 1903 and three adults and seven nymphs taken at Tampa January 17 1904 represent this species.
All the specimens from Tampa were taken from under a tin sign on an oak tree.
H. Pycnoscelus surinamensis Linnsus.
This tropical species is represented by a scries of sixtyfour adult and immature specimens.
But one specimen was taken at Tampa a. nymph on January 17 1904 and it would appear from this that the species is not so common that far north.
Miami is represented by specimens taken in January February and during the summer while Key West individuals were all fourteen in number taken January 19 and 20 1904.
I have always found this species plentiful at Iiami under stones and rubbish.
In Key West it was very abundant under coquina boulders in the woods.
I have noticed that they usually attempt to escape by burrowing.
H. Plectoptera poeyi Saussure.
This Cuban type is represented by a series of eight specimens taken at Key West on January 19 1904.
These specimens are the first of the species with exact data recorded from the United States.
Family MANTIDJE.
Stagmomantis Carolina Jolianuson.
One immature female beaten from scrub at Key West on January 20 1904 belongs to this species.
Several males were taken at Miami on February 4 1903 attracted to light.
 Gonatista grisea Fabricius.
Six immature individuals from Key West January 19 1904 and one from Miami February 6 1904 are referable to this species.
Key West.
 The immature specimens of this species were abundant upon the trunks of the gumbolimbo trees.
They ran about with 3 great swiftness but when resting pressed themselves close to the bark which they exactly resembled.
Miami.
 I found a few immature specimens on the trunk of a tree in a swampy spot near the Miami river.
H. Thesprotia graminis Scudder.
This species is represented by an immature specimen from Tampa taken January 17 1904 another from Key West taken January 18 1904 and six mature or nearly mature individuals from Miami taken in February March July and August.
I have usually found this species in the pine straw of the pine woods which it so closely resembles as to be invisible when stationary.
H. Family PHASMID.
Anisomorpha buprestoides Stoll.
Three specimens of this species were taken at Key West on January 19 1904 and one adult has been examined from Miami taken August 5 1903.
Specimens from Key West were taken from among the roots of gumbolimbo trees.
A pair taken on January 19 were in coitu.

H. Tettigidea lateralis Say.
This species was taken at Miami February 6 1903.
Badinotatnm brevipenne Thomas.
This species apparently does not occur on Key West as no specimens were taken.
Tampa is represented by sixteen specimens taken on January 17 1904 while thirteen specimens from Miami were taken on January 29 and 31 and February 3 1903 February 6 and 9 1904 and July 28 1904.
Several of the adult females arc of vciy large size.
The usual color forms are represented in the series.
Specimens from Tampa were all taken in the grasses bordering the shallow ponds.
Those from Miami were taken in the wiregrass and undergrowth of the pine woods.
H. Tmxalis brevicornis Johannson.
A single male from Chokoloskee represents this species.
Syrbula admirabilis Uhler.
Asingle female of this species was taken at Miami on September 1 1903.

Macneillia obscura Scudder.
.
A series of eighteen specimens  six adult males six adult females six nymphs  from Miami were taken February 6 and 9 1904.
They represent both color phases the green and the brown the latter predominating and including all except one adult female and one nymph.
The green female has the dorsal half of the latter lobes of the pronotum the face except the costal region and the dorsal face of the caudal femora grass green the remainder of the surface being colored much as in the brown phase.
Five nymphs from Tampa taken on Januar'17 1904 were also examined.
I found these specimens in the wiregrass of the pine woods over a mile from town on the Everglades road.
All the specimens were taken within a few yards of each other and diligent search failed to reveal others in the surrounding woods.
The females were easily captured but the males sprang about with alacrity.
H. Amblytropidia oocidentalis Saussure.
Thirteen specimens of this species have been examined  three taken at Miami February 7 and 9 1904 eight at Cape Florida Biscayne Key February 8 1904 one at Tampa January 17 1904 and one at Chokoloskce.

The males are all uniformly colored except for the presence of a median broad blackish longitudinal bar on the head a character not noticeable in the type very distinct in two and faintly indicated in two others.
The females however exhibit a great color diversity the type representing one form another is dull brown with little or no contrasts in fact resembling the coloration of Amblytro'pidia occidentalis the third is cinnamonrufous on the head and pronotum with the usual postocular streak while the tegmina are a very delicate pinkish without any longitudinal bar.
Arphia granulata Saussure.
This quite distinct species is represented by a series of four from Chokoloskee two from Miami taken February 6 1903 and Februar 7 1904 and four from Key West taken January 20 1904.
Three of this series are females and two of them from Chokoloskee are of a decided blackish hue.
Key West.
 I found this species in a few sunny openings in the scrub at the eastern end of the Key.
Miami.
 Specimens were taken in pine woods near the town.
H. Chortophaga viridifasoiata DeGeer A series of thirtyseven specimens represents this common and widely distributed species.
Miami specimens were taken in January February and July Key West individuals on the 18th and 19th of January 1904 Tampa is represented by three specimens taken January 16 and 17 1904.
Four specimens are from Chokoloskee.
Dissosteira Carolina Linuseus.
One female from Chokoloskee Scirtetica picta Scudder.
This beautiful species is apparently rather common at Miami in July sixteen specimens taken on the 20th having been examined.
Two specimens taken there on February 6 1904 were also studied.
The hoary suffusion so noticeable in the species of this genus is limited in some individuals and more general in others very much as in the closely related S. marmorata.
In a few places in the pine woods this species was plentiful but specimens were hard to capture on account of their extreme shyness.
H. Psinidia fenestralis Serville.
This sandloving species is represented by a series of sixteen specimens taken at Chokoloskee and Miami on February 6.
1904 and July 20 1903.
As a rule they are darker than northern specimens and have the transverse bars on the lateral aspects of the caudal femora more pronounced.
Dictyophorus guttatus Stoll.
This striking species is represented by four specimens taken at Miami on July 11 1903 and June 2 1899 the latter collected by Dr. H. A. Pilsbry and in the collection of the Academy.
A number of specimens have also been examined from Chokoloskee Tarpon Springs Hillsboro county November 1903 and Good all Volusia county August.
Pseudopomala brachyptera Scudder.
A single adult female of this species from Chokoloskee has been examined.
This is the first record of this species from the Southern States Stenacris chlorizans Walker.
This waterloving species is represented by a single individual from Miami taken January 30 1903.
A specimen from St. Augustine in the collection of the Academy has also been examined.
Leptysma marginicollis Serville.
This elusive species is no doubt of regular occurrence in suitable localities ten specimens having been examined from Chokoloskee Tampa January 17 1904 Miami January 16 23 and February 2 1899 S. N. Rhoads and De Funiak Springs Walton county February 20 C. W. Johnson.
All the specimens have the lateral lines distinct.
Specimens from Tampa were taken in the marshy places along the bay.
H. ScMstocerca americana Drury.
This powerful species is represented by a series of thirteen Key West specimens taken on January 18 and 19 1904 two females from Cape Florida February 8 1904 a single Chokoloskee individual anda'series of ten from Miami taken in July 1903 and February 1904.
January specimens from Miami are also in the Academy collection.
Schistocerca damnifica Saussure.
A male from Miami taken February G 1904 and a female from Chokoloskee represent this species.
Schistocerca alutacea Harris.
Three males two from Key West January 20 1904 and one from Chokoloskee represent this species.
The Kej' West individuals are rather uniformly colored while the Chokoloskee specimen is striped.
Key West.
 These specimens were taken in the open bush near the city.
H. ScMstocerca obscura Fabricius.
One male from Miami taken August 12 1903 is referred to this species.
Melanoplus puer Scuddei.
Twentynine specimens represent this peculiar species several being immature and the adults all larger than Scudder's measurements.
One individual is from Tampa while the remainder are from Miami taken February 6 7 and 9 1904.
The species was previously known only from Fort Reed Orange county and Jacksonville Duval county.
Tampa.
 The specimen from Tampa was taken in a grassy spot near the railroad.
Miami.
 These specimens were taken in the undergrowth of the pine woods both to the north and the west of the town.
H. Melanoplus keeleri Thomas.
A series of twentysix individuals evenly divided between the sexes represent this species.
All are from Miami taken in July and August 1903.
Some of the male specimens have the cerci typical of keeleri while others might with justice be referred to deletor and it appears very possible that the two species are identical.
The series examined cannot be separated by the cerci into two forms one extreme running into the other while in all other characters no difference exists.
The series exhibits a considerable amount of color variation and in size both sexes are larger than Scudder's measurements.
Paroxya floridiana Thomas.
A male and a female from Miami taken July 17 1903 and January 23 1899 and three females from Chokoloskee represent this species.
Paroxya atlantica Scudder.
A series of fiftyfive males and twentysix females represents this species.
Miami individuals were taken in February July and August Cape Florida specimens two on February 8 1904 Tampa individuals two on January 17 1904 and the Key West series on January 19 1904.
Chokoloskco is represented by a number of specimens without data.
Many of the males are extremely small and the Key West series twentysix in number is remarkable on account of the distinct bars on the posterior femora a feature not very marked on specimens from other localities.
The same series appears somewhat smaller than the mainland representatives especially the females and possibly may be an insular race worthy of separation.
Those taken in Tampa and Miami were found in marshy spots while those from Cape Florida and Key West were found on dry ground among weeds.
H. Aptenopedes olara Rehn.
This beautiful species is represented by a series of fortyone specimens exhibiting a great amount of variation in size and considerable in color.
A topotypic series from Miami were taken on February 6 and 7 1904 and in July 1903 while Key West is represented by twelve specimens indistinguishable from the types and taken on January 19 and 20 1904.
Several individuals from Cape Florida Key Biscayne taken February S 1904 are of enormous size but cannot be separated otherwise from the types.
Eight specimens from Tampa taken January 16 and 17 1904 have the cerci slightly shorter and less falcate than in Miami specimens but the fiucula are as in true clara and the tendency toward sphenarioides is extremely slight.
The range in total length of adult males is from 19 millimeters in Miami specimens to 26.5 in the Cape Florida type in adult females from 24 in small Miami specimens to 34 in the largest Cape Florida representatives.
The brown phase of coloration has been noticed in the female only the male presenting little else than variation in the intensity of the green phase of coloration.
The specimens from Tampa were taken in marshy spots along the bay.
In Key West I found the species among the low dry herbage near the city and on Cape Florida in a dense tangle of vines and grasses.
Those from Miami were captured in the vmdergrowth of the pine woods.
H. Aptenopedes aptera Scudder.
Folumales of this species taken at Miami February 7 1904 have ben examined.
The caudal femora of this species appear heavier than in any of the other species of the genus.
These specimens were taken in the wiregrass of the pine woods to the north of Miami.
Specimens were very hard to find here and none were taken to the west of the town where otherwise the best collecting was secured.
H. Family TETTIGONID.

A single female specimen of this neotropical species from Chokoloskee has been examined.
It is slightly smaller than a Nicaraguan female in the Academy collection but can without hesitancy be referred to this species.
Scudder has recorded it from the Florida Keys.

Two specimens male and female from Miami represent this species in the Hebard collection.
They were taken on February 5 and September 12.
A single female in the collection of the Academy was taken at Miami on February 1 1899 by S. N. and M. C. Rhoads and another male at Braidentown Manatee county.
Many specimens of this species could be heard stridulating in the trees after dark but were difficult to capture.

Allied to M. lucidum Brunner from Brazil from wh'ch it differs in the triangularly produced mcsoand metasternal lobes and the less rotundate character of the tegmina.
The new form can readily be distinguished from the other North American species by its much smaller size and the peculiar fastigium.
Size small form as usual in the genus.
Head but slightly punctate dorsad occiput and vertex deplanate moderately declivent fastigium of tho vertex narrow produced distinctly sulcate apically rounded and not as wide as the proximal joint of the antennae frontal fastigium much narrower than the fastigium of the vertex and touching the same  eyes subspherical moderately prominent slightly depressed separated from one another by a space equal to the length of one of them antcnnse with the proximal joint subquadrate in section rather small.

Belocephalus subapterus Scudder.
Two females one from Miami August 19 1903 and the other from Chokoloskee represent this species.
The Chokoloskee specimen is smaller than the Miami individual but has the o'ipositor longer.
Both are of a brownish color which apparently is the natural coloration.
The tcgmina and wings are present as very small pads.
Pyrgocorypha uncinata Harris.
This striking species is represented by four specimens two from Miami one taken July 11 1903 immature the other without date and two from Chokoloskee.
They agree very well with Mexican specimens.
Conooeplialus mexicanus Saussure.
Three specimens represent this species one from Tampa taken January 15 1904 the others from Miami taken February 5 1903 and February 6 1904.
Tampa.
 I took this specimen in a marshy spot on the shore of Tampa Bay.

Type 6 Chokoloskee Monroe county Florida.
Hebard collection Apparently allied to Conocephalus truncatirostris Redtenbacher from Brazil C. exiliscanorus Davis from Staten Island and C. bruneri Blatchley from Indiana.
From the former it can readily be distinguished by the slenderer head and smaller size while the shape of the fastigium will separate it from the latter species.
Size medium form rather slender and moderately compressed.
Head vith the occiput and vertex horizontal the rostrum elongate and produced into a rather slender bluntly rounded process which is distinctly longer than the interspace between the eyes ventral surface with a blunt basal tooth frontal fastigium produced but not quite touching the process of the rostrum eyes rounded ovate in outline not very prominent.

Apparently allied to C. ensifer Bolivar from Peru but differing in the short and acuminate tegmina and wings.
The blunt broad fastigium short sublanceolate tegmina and straight elongate ovipositor will at once distinguish this species.
Size large form robust limbs short.
Head somewhat depressed subdeplanate dorsad occiput and vertex horizontal rostrum moderately produced extending beyond the cephalic margin of the eyes a distance slightly less than the interocular space apex rotund atotruncate rounded and with no distinct angles frontal fastigium broadly touching the blunt ventral process of the rostrum eyes subovate small not prominent.

Conocephalus retusus Scudder.
A single female from Chokoloskee is referred to this species.
This species has never before been recorded south of Georgia.
Orchelimum vulgare Harris.
A pair of this species from Chokoloskee has been examined.
Orchelimum concinnum Scudder.
A female from Chokoloskee is the most southern record for this species whose general range is more western.
Orchelimum nitidum Redteubacher.
A male individual from Chokoloskee probably belongs to this species differing from the description in several details which however appear to be unimportant.
Xiphidion gracillimum Morse.
A scries of fourteen specimens nine males and five females represents this beautiful species.
Miami adult specimens were taken on January 30 July 1720 and September 12 1903 immature specimens on Februar 6 and 8 1904.
A single immature male from Tampa was taken January 16 1904.
Considerable variation is exhibited in the intensity of the dorsal stripe.
The type series of the species was taken at Capron and Biscayne Bay.
All specimens of this species which I captured were found among dense weeds.
H. Xiphidion brevipenne Scudder.
This widely distributed species is represented by one female taken at Chokoloskee.
Atlanticus sp.
Fourteen immatiuc specimens belonging to a species of this genus were taken at Miami on February 6 and 9 1904 and at Tampa on January 17 1904.
They apparently are not gibbosus but are quite different from the other species of the genus.
Ceuthophilus latibuli Scudder.
A series of eleven specimens of both sexes represents this richly colored species.
They were taken at Enterprise Volusia county April 18 1903 by Mr. Philip Laurent.
The species was described from Crescent Ciw Florida and Georgia.
Mr. Laurent informs me that this species is found abundantly in gopher holes.
In one hole which he dug out the whole of the bottom of the burrow was covered with them.
H. Family GRYLLID.
Mogoplistes slossoni Scudder.
A female specimen of this species which is considerably smaller than the type measurements and apparently immature was taken at Miami February 6 1904.
The antennae have four distinct blackish annuli on a chestnut ground.
I took this specimen under a sign on an oak tree in the hammock just across the river from Miami.
One other specimen was noticed but escaped by springing from the tree.
Great difficulty was experienced in capturing the specimen without rubbing off its silver scales.
H. Liphoplus krugii Saussnre.
This species was originally described from Cuba and has never since been recorded outside of that island.
Seven specimens one male six females taken at Key West January 19 1904 appear to be referable to this form.
These specimens were taken from Ilex cassine by beating in company with Plectopiera poeyi and Cyrtoxipha delicatula.
The specimens were all secured with little difficulty.

Distinguished from L. krugii by the apparent tegmina the smaller size and peculiar coloration.
Size very small form depressed surface partially and probably wholly in the perfect unabradcd insect covered with minute scales of a silverywhite color.
Head depressed the front with a distinct longitudinal median incision narrow but distinct eyes reniform in outline subvertical antennae considerably exceeding the body in length.
Pronotum scutellate equal to half the length of the body moderately arched the lateral portions deflected toward the median line cephalic portion considerably narrower than the caudal portion the margin truncate  caudal margin very distinctly rotundate  lateral margins straight.
Tegmina visible only as a projecting fringe around the caudal portion of the pronotum the structure apparently being a fanlike set of radiating veins margined apically ly a narrow deflected subcoriaceous area.
Abdomen short thickly covered with scales.
Limbs heavily scaled cephalic and median pair very short caudal femora strongly inflated supplied with a number of long hairs tibiae shorter than the femora and narrowed somewhat proximad metatarsi serratodentate dorsad.
General colors vandyke brown and silverywhite the tibiae and tarsi alternately ringed with these shades caudal femora silverywhite obscvu'ely mottled with the darker color antennae wood brown becoming darker apically and narrowly and rather sparsely ringed with a deeper shade  head probably uniform silverywhite when unrubbed  4 pronotum cinnamon darker on the lateral portions of the cephalic half the lateral lobe lined above with pale ochreyellow and below with a broad line of silverywhite scales.
Tegmina bone white the margins blotched with the two predominating colors.
Abdomen finely mottled with the two contrasting tints.

Length of pronotum 2.9  Caudal width of pronotum .
1.9  Length of caudal femora 3.1  Of this beautiful and peculiar species the type is the only specimen which has been seen.
The striking coloration is quite distinctive and will immediately separate it from L. krugii.
This specimen I captured in the pine woods to the west of Miami It was first noticed perched on the top of a tuft of wiregrass.
After having swept it into the net I very nearly lost it for it jumped around with great agility.
H. Nemobius socius Seudder.
An adult female and an immature individual from Tampa taken January 16 and 17 1904 represent this species.
The adult has the tegmina but slightly longer than the head and pronotum while the wings are not visible.
In all other respects however the Tampa female is inseparable from macropterous individuals from Thomas ville Georgia.
Nemobius ambitiosus Scudder.
This beautiful species is represented by three specimens two males and a nymph from Miami taken February 6 1904 and a pair from Tampa taken January 16 and 17 1904.
This species is almost invariably found in dead leaves.
H. Nemobius aterrimus Scudder.
This species originally described from Jacksonville Florida is represented by a pair taken at Tampa on January 17 1904.
Gryllus firmus Scudder.
A single male from Miami represents this species.
Gryllus rubens Scudder.
This species is represented by a series of ten males and sixteen females.
Miami specimens were taken on February 6 1904 and August 19 and 21 1903 Tampa specimens on January 16 1904 and Chokoloskee individuals in April and May 1903.
Several of the specimens are smaller than the usual type and are referred here with a little uncertainty.
The specimens taken on February 6 were all found under boards and stones along the main street of Miami.
They were captured after dusk while stridulating at a great rate.
H. Gryllodes poeyi Saussure.
This Antillean species is represented by m'ne specimens three adult males two adult females and four nymphs from Miami taken February 6 7 and 9 1904.
They are inseparable from a series of Cuban and Bahaman individuals and constitute the first record of the species from the United States.
The first evening in Miami I heard this cricket stridulating in cracks between the bricks of the drive leading to the Hotel Royal Palm.
Marking the places as it was then too dark to investigate I left them till the next morning.
I then was able to raise the bricks and collected several specimens.
One specimen was taken stridulating in a crack six feet from the ground between the stones which form the front of the Miami Bank.
This insect emits a shrill sound easily distinguished from Gryllus ruhens by its higher pitch and the longer duration of the stridulations.
When exposed it waves its long slender antennae about continually.
H. Cyrtoxipha delicatula Scudder.
A series of eight adult males seven adult females and a nymph from Key West taken January 19 1904 are referred to this species.
An adult male and a nymph were also taken at Miami February 6 1904.
This series does not wholly agree with Scudder's description taken from two males from Fort Reed and Sand Point Florida but as a great amount of variation in the presence of pronotal hairs and considerable in the length of the wings is exhibited by the specimens studied it is impossible to attempt to separate them.
Saussure's C. gundlachi is of a quite different appearance.
Key West.
 These specimens I beat from Ilex cassine with little difficulty.
I found no others on any other bushes and would probably have missed the species in this locality had I not happened to beat this bush.
I found it to be the same in the case of Plectoptera poeyi and Liphoplus krugii.
Miami.
 The nymph was beaten from a bush in the hammock and the mature specimen was taken at night when beating for Microcentrum.
H. Hapithus quadratus Scudder.
This species which has been synonymized with H. agitator by both Saussurc and Scudder appears to be quite distinct and really separable from the northern H. agitator.
The tcgmina of the female are somewhat longer and with a more complex venation while the posterior limbs are longer and distinctly colored and as far as available material ooes the general size appears greater.
Two adult females from Miami were taken August 11 and 21 1903 while two nymphs from the same place were collected on February 6 1904.
One nymph was taken at Key West January 19 1904.
Keij West. This specimen was taken together with Plectoplcra poeyi and Liphoplus krugii while beating Ilex cassine.
H. Orocharis saulcyi cir6riu.
This Antillcan species here recorded from the United States for the first time is represented by two males taken at Miami one on February 3 the other on August 19 1903.
The very slender form and structure of the tegmina will readily separate this from the other North American species.
The specimen captured on February 3 1903 was beaten from the high weeds in a waste field H. Tafalisca' lurida Walker.
A single female from Chokoloskee represents this species. '
This name was denied recognition by Saussure for lack of significance but it should replace Metrypa Brunner having five years priority.
