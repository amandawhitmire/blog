AMERICAN ORTHOPTERA.
DIVISION II.
BY A. N. CAUDELL and MORGAN HEBARD.
The Species of North American Orthoptera Described by Andrew Nelson Caudell.
The desirability of selection and fixation of a single type was pointed out by the last International Entomological Congress and the first paper on this subject with reference to the North American species of Orthoptera by Mr. James A. G. Rehn and the junior author of the present paper has recently appeared in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences 1912 pp.
60128.
In the preface to that paper the subject is discussed and method of selection of lectotypic specimens as followed in that contribution explained.
In the present paper the work is made easy owing to the fact that the author of all the species treated has selected from the typical series that specimen for single type which he would have selected at the time the species was described had such action at that time been customary.
The type numbers of the United States National Museum for Orthoptera are not available in fixing single types though they are given in the original descriptions of all new species recently described or named from material belonging to that institution.
This is due to the fact that in the Orthoptera Collection these type numbers do not refer to a single type or to the male and female types of a species but usually to the entire typical series.
Of the seventyfive species described by the senior author which are found in North America we find sixtytwo single types in the United States National Museum seven in the Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences two in the Scudder Collection and one each in the American Museum of Natural History of New York the Saussure Collection and the Morse Collection while of one species the typical series is lost.
At the present day all of these single types .re extant with the exception of the one mentioned as lost those of the United States National Museum are in Riker Mounts.
The nomenclature given is that of the original description as this paper is not intended to be in any way revisionary.
All forms described by the senior author at the present date considered valid and also all synonyms are here treated.

APPARENT SUNCRA.CK STRUCTURES AND RINGINGROCK PHENOMENA IN THE TRIASSIC DIABASE OF EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA.
BY EDGAR T. WHERRY PH.D.
The rocks deposited during the Triassic period in eastern North America variously known as the New Red Newark and JuraTrias cross the State of Pennsylvania in a northeastsouthwest strip averaging twenty miles in width.
While they have in the past been the subject of considerable investigation some of their most interesting features are as yet undescribed.
1 About the middle of the 20000 feet of sediments representing the period in Montgomery County there occurs a sill of diabase which although greater in size than the Palisade sheet of New Jersey has attracted far less attention since it does not happen to be so located as to give rise to striking scenic effects.
The total length of outcrop of this sill being over 40 miles it would be strange if there were not a few exposures of its contact relations with the sediments even in the absence of a great metropolis nearby as an inducement for railroad companies to pierce it by numerous cuts and tunnels and in fact its upper contact has been observed at several localities northeast of the city of Pottstown.
The rock surfaces exposed at these places by the removal of the metamorphosed shale beds present a rather startling appearance being crossed by a rudely hexagonal network of lightcolored lines closely resembling suncracks such as are frequently found in the sediments.
The best exposure a photograph of which is shown in figure 1 Plate II is on the east side of a road opposite the house of Alexander C. Minshall onehalf mile north of Neiffer Post Office which lies about three miles north of Limerick Square and two miles west of Zieglersville.
1 The writer has been engaged for several years in studying the portion of this area lying east of the Susquehanna River and has previously published two papers upon it The Newark Copper Deposits of Southeastern Pennsylvania Econ.

There can be no question however as to the igneous origin of the rock.
When studied in thin section it is found to consist of interlacing laths of labradorite surrounded by augite similar to the contact facies of Triassic diabases which have been described elsewhere.
2 The lines turn out to be dikes composed of coarser crystals of the same minerals fig.
3 Plate II.
These dikes vary from  to 5 mm.
in thickness and penetrate into the rock to depths of several centimeters gradually losing their identity as the size of grain of the background increases.
The explanation of this occurrence is apparently to be found in the tendency of magmas to contract on solidifying exemplified in the wellknown columnar structure of many basalts.
In the course of the intrusion of the magma the outer portions were rapidly chilled by the cold wallrocks and solidified in correspondingly finegrained form.
At the same time there developed perpendicular to the contact surfaces hexagonally arranged shrinkage cracks.
Into these the still liquid material beneath found its way but since in the meantime the surroundings had become heated cooling was now less rapid and larger crystals were formed.
The boulders which everywhere characterize the diabase areas often show on their surface a hexagonalcrack effect resembling at first sight that just described fig.
2 Plate II.
The two phenomena are however quite distinct for thin sections of the rock beneath these cracks fail to indicate the existence of any structural peculiarity fig.
4 Plate II and the cracking is evidently caused by expansion of the surface layers during the exfoliation of the boulders under the action of frost.
The striking similarity of these two effects to one another and of both to suncracks is due then to the fact that all three have their origin in tension exerted' uniformly in a plane the normal result of which is as is well known the development of cracks at approximate angles of 120 degrees.
The blocks of diabase are occasionally collected into boulder fields  in Germany termed Felsenmeere or rock seas  tracts often an acre or more in extent which are practically barren of vegetation because of the absence of soil in striking contrast to most of the surrounding region fig.

Many of the boulders ring like a metal when struck and under the name of ringingrocks have attracted considerable attention from the inhabitants of the neighbor2 Lewis J. V. Ann.

hood many a fantastic theory having been advanced to account for their formation.
The principal localities of these ringingrock fields are Narrows ville Bucks County on the edge of the plateau south of the Delaware River 3 miles east of Kintners ville.
Shelly Bucks County 2 miles northeast of the railroad station.
Spring Mount Montgomery County east of the Perkiomen Creek one mile above Schwenksville.
Ringing Rocks Park 2 miles northeast of Pottstown.
BlueRocks 1 mile east of Elverson Station Chester County.
Although most of these places are rather widely known and are frequently visited by outing parties curiously enough no scientific description of them appears to have ever been published.
The manner of formation of the large rounded rock masses known as boulders as described in textbooks of geology is as follows The solid rocks at or near the earth's surface are travi rsed by numerous cracks or joints usually intersecting in such a way as to divide them into roughly rectangular or rhomboidal blocks.
Rain water percolating downward along these joints attacks and gradually decomposes the rock constituents but since at the intersections of planes the action can take place in several directions at once edges yield twice and corners three times as rapidly as the flat surfaces and as a result the ultimate shape attained by the blocks is that of a spheroid fig.
8 Plate II.
Boulders thus developed usually remain surrounded by weathered rock fragments or the derived soil but when running water finds its way around them this finer material may be removed leaving them exposed to view.
Study of the abovementioned occurrences has shown that this explanation is adequate to account for their formation.
The boulder fields are always found at or near the base of the sheet of igneous rock where the intensely metamorphosed underlying sediments form an impervious pavement over which streams of water flow this can sometimes be heard or even seen through spaces between the blocks.
Their exact position is determined by local conditions such as the dip of the strata which apparently must be less than 30 the configuration of the hills which affects the flow of the streams and perhaps other factors.
But the point calling for particular emphasis in view of the popular opinion about the matter is that there has been absolutely no  upheaval or other violent disturbance to bring the boulders together but that they have quite to the contrary been formed by the gradual breaking up and washing away of material from the solid rocks originally occupying the ground.
The cause of the ring of the boulders when struck is no doubt to be sought in the peculiar rock texture.
As seen in thin sections fig.
5 Plate II the feldspar crystals interlace to form a close network in which sound waves can readily develop.
But this alone is not sufficient  the boulders must also be supported so as to be able to vibrate freely just as is necessary with a bell for thin sections of two of them found side by side one ringing finely the other not at all show absolutely no textural difference figs.
5 and 6 Plate II but the former was loosely supported and the latter wedged firmly between other blocks.
It is to be concluded then that the ringingrocks consist of boulders formed in the places where they are found by simple normal processes of weathering and that their ringing qualities are due to the texture of the diabase rock of which they are composed.

BY HAROLD SELLERS COLTON.
The following paper is a preliminary study of the pond snail Lymncea columella Say with the particular view of its furnishing material for the study of genetics.
We should look to this form because of the probability that when isolated from one another the eggs that are laid are self fertilized.
No studies have yet been made on animals that reproduce by selffertilization so that as pointed out by Jennings 1911 B no work on animals can be directly compared with that on plants.
Notwithstanding the many means by which hermaphroditic animals prevent selffertilization a number of cases are well known where normally selffertilization does occur.
As an example of this the following groups may be quoted Rhabdocoel Turbellarians Sekera 1906 Polystomum Zeller 1876 j 1 the digenetic Trematodes Leucart v. Siebold Zaddock Voeltzkow and others the Cestodes Loess Carlisle Schultze Bellingham van Beneden Pagenstecher Leuekhart 2 and others the Ascidians Cynthia and Molgula Morgan 1904 Botryllus Pizon 1893 and the pond snail Lymncea.
This paper will not discuss the adaptability of the material from the Flat Worms or the Ascidians for breeding experiments.
Parasites and marine animals furnish great difficulties at the outset for such a study and Rhabdocoels reproduce also asexually so we will turn at once and consider the case of the pond snail.
The first point to be determined is Does Lymncea self fertilize its eggs
Oken 1817 3 isolated an individual adult Lymncea.
After an interval of some months this snail laid fertile eggs.
Oken concluded that this was a case of selffertilization.
Von Hiring 1876 showed how in many gastropods Helix for example a long period as much as a year may intervene between copulation and egglaying.
Because of this he did not consider Oken's experiment of any value.
1 See Bronn 1899 and 1900.
2 See Bronn 1899 and 1900.
3 See Braun 1888.
In the meantime von Baer 1835 reported an observation which seemed to confirm Oken's view.
He actually saw Lymncea auricularia with own penis inserted in its own female opening.
Braun 1888 isolated eggs of Lymncea auricularia in separate vessels and raised the young snails which when they reached adult size laid eggs which developed.
Although this author had the snails under observation for weeks and months at a time he never was able to confirm von Baer.
Nevertheless he did not doubt that von Baer was correct in what he saw.
The present writer has repeatedly isolated eggs and had them develop into snails which laid fertile eggs but has.
never witnessed a case of selfcopulation.
There is the alternative that must be disposed of  Can it be that these eggs are not selffertilized but that they develop parthenogenetically
This question cannot as yet be fully answered.
To be sure normal parthenogenesis is unknown in mollusks but direct evidence on the case in Lymncea is lacking.
The reduced number of chromosomes in maturation of the sperm is small six to eight but as yet the writer has been unable to satisfactorily imbed the eggs so that they may be cut.
As yet he has been unable to observe the first cleavage figures.
An examination of the reproductive organs of the snail will show that there is no reason why selffertilization should not occur.
This system is a complicated one in the lungbearing mollusks and Lymncea is no exception to the rule.
The eggs and sperm arise side by side in a common ovitestis.
When ripe both eggs and sperm pass down a common hermaphrodite duct.
Into this duct the albumen gland opens the function of which is to secrete around the egg a thick coat of albumen.
This is the substance which makes the eggs so difficult to imbed.
Past this point the duct divides into a threadlike vas deferens with wider portion called the prostate gland and a thickerAvailed oviduct.
The former leads finally to an invertible penis just back of the tentacle on the right side of the animal while the oviduct opens somewhat to the exterior somewhat posterior to the former with a narrow slit.
Into the oviduct near its aperture opens the duct from the socalled sperm receptacle in which the writer has never found sperm but in which very often he has found eggs.
He hopes to deal with this matter at another time.
The reason for describing in some detail the reproductive organs of this animal is to make clear that there is every piece of mechanism present to allow selffertilization.
If the eggs are not fertilized in the upper part of the oviduct they may be by selfcopulation in the lower part.
The fact that selfcopulation had been observed by no other observer than the great von Baer the fact that a case of parthenogenesis is as yet unreported in the group of the mollusks together with the fact that there is every arrangement present in the animal to make selffertilization possible  all these seem to the writer sufficient evidence that the chance that parthenogenesis plays a part is remote.
This must not be taken as precluding this remote possibility.
Are these animals easy to handle in a breeding experiment
This question may be answered on the whole yes.
In 1908 the writer Colton 1908 published the results of a series of experiments on the pond snail Lymncea columella showing the effects of various external conditions upon the growth.
Among other things the writer found how easy it is to raise Lymncea from the egg under ordinary laboratory conditions.
They will live in as little .as 500 cc.
of water and require next to no care.
Philadelphia city water from the tap was found to be fatal to the young snails but the same water after standing in a large aquarium for some time could then be used.
In his experiments this winter even this water proved fatal so that water had to be procured from the nearby pond in the Botanical Garden of the University.
In the previous experiments a water plant Myriophyllum.
and a little soil seemed to offer the optimum conditions for growth aeration being neglected.
This winter the writer has had the best results in using dead leaves of trees from the bottom of the pond referred to above.
These were washed in running tap water as a precaution against introducing young snails from the pond.
The best results are now procured by using about 7001000 cc.
of pond water in a battery jar and placing in this a halfdecayed leaf such as a maple leaf.
One snail only is of course placed in the jar.
The length of time that it takes from hatching to egglaying varies greatly.
As the cause of this variation is not understood at all it will be at the present time worth while to mention only some of the cases.
Thirteen had the following interval from hatching to egglaying 32 26 35 49 58 92 50 50 56 57 63 74 and 74 days.
Twentysix days was the shortest interval.
This shows even if we neglect the shortest periods how surprisingly rapid is the growth.
As.
for ease of handling in a laboratory Lymncea columella is seen to furnish splendid material.
They require little care little space and come to maturity promptly.
What are the characters that distinguish the various species and varieties of Lymncea from one another and what is the character of the variation within one species
The most recent work on the systematic relationships of the various species and varieties of Lymncea is the monograph on the group by F. C. Baker 1911.
This writer recognizes one hundred and two recent species and varieties which he distributes through six genera as follows Lymncea two species and three varieties Radix one species Bulimncea one species Acella.
one species Galba fiftyeight species and twentyeight varieties.
The characters on which these genera are distinguished from one another are as follows  the relative size of portions of the male reproductive organs whether there are one or two penis sac retractors whether there are two or three cusps on the lateral teeth proportions of the jaws length of the spire axis of the shell gyrate or not sculpture of the surface etc.
It will be noticed that all these characters with the exception of two are purely quantitative.
The character of the teeth is a qualitative difference to which the author attributed little importance as his Galba obrussa has the same type of radula as his Pseudosuccinea columella when the latter is halfgrown.
There is no qualitative difference between the radulse of the adults.
Many Galba have triand other Galba have bicuspid lateral teeth.
Of the one hundred and two species and varieties of but thirtytwo did the writer know aught of the anatomy of the reproductive organs.
Nothing is apparently known of the internal anatomy of the type species of the genus Galba that is Galba tnmcahda Muller.
Since the important characters in describing the genera are purely quantitative the present writer feels that he cannot accept these genera and will for the present consider the old genus Lymncea as including them all.
When we know more some genera may perhaps be farther separated.
Not being a systematist the author cannot criticise this work and he is very thankful that someone has taken the trouble to examine all the literature and the species of this interesting group bringing it together in one work.
The individual species are separated one from the other by quantitative differences in the shell characters body characters by color and where known the genital organs the radula and jaw.
This roughly outlines the sort of variation that takes place within the genus.
Within a single species what can we look for
In the present case where selection is hoped to be practiced characters visible on the exterior can alone be considered.
This forbids us at the outset dealing with any characters of the internal 1912.
177 organs.
In the snail the shell at once presents itself.
So far we have considered the shell alone.
Adams 1900 made a careful study of the freshwater prosobranch mollusk Io taken from many stations on the same watershed.
He measured the height of the spine the length of the aperture and width of the shell.
In the present study three characters were also measured.
These were chosen so that when their ratios were plotted a picture of the average shape of the shells of the colony from which the collections were made would result.
The length of.
the spire of the shell may be expressed by the ratio  altitude to length of aperture.
See AT m fig.
1 where  this ratio.
The width of the shell may be expressed roughly in terms of a ratio length of the aperture to the width.
The AD former ratio g we will refer to as the ratio and the latter ratio we will refer to as the index.
Using the measurements furnished by Baker 1911 which are probably measurements of extreme individuals calculating their index and ratio and plotting them using the index as an ordinate and the ratio as the abscissa when these Fig.
1. are enclosed by a line then we have a rough picture of the shape of the shell.
Fig.
2 shows such a picture and the dark oval represents Lymnwa columella as it occurs about Philadelphia as compared with some forms taken from Baker's measurements.
The writer made a number of collections of Lymncea columella from some ponds and streams about Philadelphia and also examined several series in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
4 The three characters referred to above were measured with proportional dividers the index and ratio were calculated and plotted in groups.
Fig.
3 shows a number of these collections.
The 4 The writer wishes to thank Dr. H. A. Pilsbry of the Academy of Natural tSciences for many courtesies.
178 May probable error of the single ratio and index was calculated.
These were based on twenty measurements of the three characters from a single'shell.
5 The result of this was a probable error of .04 for Fig.
2. the index and .01 for the ratio.
The probable error of the index was greater as this character was more difficult to measure.

180 May Baker 1910 found in Lymncea rejiexa that the lengthbreadth ratio of the shell increased with the length of the shell.
That is the larger shell had the higher ratio and therefore a higher spire.

The index on Table I is the abscissa.
On Table II the ratio is the abscissa.
Table I shows that the larger shells have a narrower aperture which agrees with H. B. Baker but Table II shows that the height of the spire is about constant at all ages.
On both tables no conclusions can be based on shells under eight millimeters for two reasons  the numbers of shells are too small and the probable error of each ratio is too large.
It may be as much as .10 on the part of the index and .05 for the ratio.
Remembering then that the larger shell may have a narrower aperture then we may look over fig.
3.
In this the Cedar Lake collection and the Wingohocking Creek collection both have narrow apertures but the former has an average shell of 9.44 mm. while the latter has an average shell length of 17.37.
The size of the shell cannot influence then the characters in question in this case.
The other diagrams tell their own story and seem to show that each restricted area has its own type of shell as far as these two characters are concerned.
The numbers are far too small on which to base many conclusions.

There were .hatched during the past winter from an egg capsule laid by a snail from the Sixtyseventh Street and Elmwood Avenue collection thirtytwo snails of which eighteen lived to be measured.
These were kept together in 1000 cc.
of water in a crystallizing dish.
They were measured from time to time.
From two of these measurements an early one and a late one 37 days and 78 days respectively fig.
4 was compiled.
The probable error of the individual 37 days old measurements which were made with the camera lucida were index .10 ratio.05.
These were so much larger in the case of the small shells because of the difficulty in orienting them in exactly the same plane at the time of measurement.
The range of the offspring are almost the same as that of the parent colony.
This is only significant as showing what we may expect when we are able to deal with larger numbers in a more precise manner.
Baker 1911 observed copulation between different individuals of Lymncea stagnalis Lymncea emarginata and Lymncea lanceata.
Several times L. emarginata tried to copulate with L. lanceata  much smaller animal.
Baker saw also L. stagnalis in copulation with emarginata .
Heynemann 1869 records a cross between auricularia and peregra the former acting as female and the latter as male.
Chaster 1909 records a cross between L. stagnalis and L. auricularia the former taking the part of the male.
The progeny were good examples of peregra and the query is raised by Chaster as to whether peregra may not be the ancestral form of auricularia and stagnalis.
Be that as it may it is possible that many of the socalled species and varieti' of Lymncea may be hybrids and it will be necessary to experiment in order to determine how true this is.
In the ponds about Philadelphia however where Lymncea columella is found the writer has never found any other species present.
The chance of hybridization is therefore rare.
Conclusion.
Johannsen 1911 clearly defined the pure line.
A pure line.''
he said maybe defined as the descendants from one single homozygotic organism exclusively propagating by selffertilization.
... A line ceases to be 'pure' when hybridization or even intercrossing disturbs the continuity of the selffertilization.
With this definition in mind it is necessary if we would have a pure line in the Johannsenian sense to deal with hermaphroditic organisms.
Not only must the organisms be hermaphroditic but selffertilization must be possible.
It must either be normal or can be induced and controlled.
These conditions can easily be fulfilled in many plants but as far as I am aware no animals with the proper requirements have been experimented upon.
To be sure Jennings 1911 and others have traced lines of Protozoa.
These animals divide by fission so that their method of reproduction is probably closely allied to asexual or to parthenogenetic reproduction as found in multicellular forms.
The Hydra with which Handel 1907 worked reproduced by budding.
On the other hand Woltereck's 1909 Daphnia were parthenogenetic.
These lines of animals therefore cannot be compared strictly with those lines in plants that reproduce through selffertilization.
Adhering strictly to Johannsen's definition as far as I know no experiments with pure lines have ever been performed with animals.
Lymncea after this superficial study would seem to furnish such material  1.
It apparently does self fertilize its eggs when isolated.
2.
The time for generation is short  two to three months.
3.
There are a few welldefined characters that may be observed.
4.
Hybridization is possible but as far as Lymncea columella from this region is concerned it is rarely that more than one species is found in a single habitat.
There is no evidence as yet that it is not homozygous.
On the whole Lymncea columella seems to combine some of the necessary requirements on which to base a pureline investigation.
