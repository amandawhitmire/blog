ECHINODERMS AND ARTHROPODS FROM JAPAN.
BY J. E. IVES.
The marine invertebrates enumerated and described in tbe following pages were collected by Mr. Frederick Stearns of Detroit ISIichigan during nearly a year's residence in Japan.
He was assisted by an intelligent Japanese who visited at intervals the entire southeastern coast from Tokyo by Sagama and Saruga along Kii Awa and Toza and the north shore of the Inland Sea as far west as Bingo in communication with the fishermen who diedge for fish and molluscs in water sometimes as deep as thirty fathoms.
The southeastern coast of Japan is washed by the warm waters of theKuro Schiwo the continuation of the north equatorial current of the Pacific.
The fauna of this coast is essentially IndoPacific although it possesses many species both of echinoderms and crustaceans peculiar to it. There does not appear to be any evidence of a recent connection of the southern portion of Japan with the mainland and the IndoPacific species found there must have been carried thither by the Kuro Schiwo probably in the larval condition.
The forms that are peculiar may be regarded as IndoPacific types differentiated by the special character of these shores.
The knowledge of the echinoderm and crustacean faunas of these coasts has been largely derived from the collections made by Ph.
Fr.
von Siebold.
The starfishes collected by him were described by Miiller and Troschel in the System der Asteriden to whose descriptions additional information was furnished by Dr.
Von Martens in 1865. The Crustacea were monographed by De Haan in the  Fauna Japonica and this beautiful work even at this day leaves little to be desired by the systeraatist.
To the knowledge of the latter group additions were made by Stimpson  in 1857 1858 and 1 For a discussion of the limitations of the Japanese region see Professor Dana in his monograph of the Crustacea of the U. S. Exploring Expedition Prof. A. Agassiz in the Revision of the Echini and Dr. Paul Fischer in the Manuel de Conchyliogie.

Dr. Ludwig Doderleinhas made the most important addition to the department of Echinoidi recording in 1885 fortyseven species of sea urchins collected by himself in Japan of which twenty were new.
The most important contribution to the Pycnogonoids of Japan was made in 1890 by Dr. A. Ortman who described the specimens collected by Dr. Doderlein.
Three new species collected by Dr. Hilgeudorff in Japan had already been described by R. BGhm ' in 1879.
The Challenger Expedition collected on the southeast coast of Japan.
Its various monographs contain contributions to the fauna of this coast.
The entire collection made by Mr. Stearns was not forwarded to me only duplicates being sent where more than one specimen was collected.
I am therefore unable to give any particulars as to the abundance or scarcity of the forms obtained except in the cases where only one specimen was found when that fact is stated.
I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. Stearns for his liberality in making possible the publication of the plates accompanying this paper.
In the following pages the species of echinoderms and Crustacea collected by Mr. Stearns are enumerated a new Ophurian a new crab and a new and interesting Pycnogonoid are described and several species of starfishes hitherto unfigured have been figured.

In the series of six specimens presented to the Academy by Mr. Stearns three are forms connecting Temnopleurus toreumatica and Temnopleurus Hardwickii as defined by Professor Alexander Agassiz in the Revision of the Echini and I am therefore compelled to regard the latter species as a synonym of the former.
One specimen having rather deep pits has the ocular and genital plates covered with prominent tubercles and other specimens show the passage from the deep rectangular pits to the bevelled grooves of the ambulacral and interambulacral regions.

The specimen given to the Academy by Mr. Stearns is intermediate in character between G. Japonicum and G. acutum and I have therefore given the latter species as a synonym of the former.
The posterior anterolateral tooth on the right side is produced as in MilneEdwards' figure of G. acutum but on the left side it is not produced and is not longer than the preceding tooth.
The carapace is rather less extended at the sides than in the figure of this species and rather more so than in the figure of G. Japonicum.
The anterolateral teeth are rather less prominent than in G. acutum and rather more so than in G. Japonicum.
The outline of the posterolateral borders of the carapace is also intermediate in character.
Three other specimens from Japan in the Museum of this Academy show the passage of the one form into the other.

Carapace subpentagonal in outline the angle of the pentagon directed forwards being occupied by the rostral teeth as broad as long  upper surface very convex smooth minutely punctate with a few minute scattered tubercles cervical groove well defined.
An illdefined groove bounded on either side by a slight elevation leads to the depression between the lateral rostral teeth.
Median rostral tooth small triangular depressed  lateral rostral teeth well developed rounded triangular their inner borders depressed supraorbital tooth very small.
The posterior border of the orbit forming a slight prominence.
Three small anterolateral teeth the third or most posterior placed at the junction of the lateral and the anterolateral edges of the carapace the second placed on a level with the third at about twothirds of the distance from the posterior border of the orbit to the third and the first placed rather higher upon the carapace than the other two at about onethird of the distance from the posterior border of the orbit to the third tooth.
Lateral border divided by a groove which coniniences at about onethird of the dititance from the third auterolateral tooth to the posterior border of the carapace.
Behind the groove at its commencement is a small tooth.
This groove is continued backwards and inwards across the branchial area and ends by passing forwards into the groove separating the branchial and cardiac regions.
The subhepatic area is small and has four small teeth two of them placed one behind the other beneath the eye along the inner border of the area  a third placed behind these two and a fourth placed half way between the last mentioned and the second anterolateral tooth on the edge of the carapace.
Two large tubercles upon the distal edge of the outer surface of the carpus of the cheliped a smaller one behind these two.
and a still smaller one above this one.
Two tubercles upon the distal end of the upper surface of the manus the outer tubercle the larger of the two and a minute tubercle situated at the proximal end of a row of three minute tubercles along the inner edge of the upper surface.
The carpal joints of the two anterior pairs of cruripeds ambulatory legs end in two tubercles the propodal joints in one.
In the specimen examined only the first pair of the last two pairs of cruripeds are entire and they possess but a single claw each.
The entire specimen under examination is covered with apparently a pilose pubescence.
The species closely resembles Cryptodromia Japonlca but may be readily distinguished from it by the presence of three anterolateral teeth instead of two.
The genus Cryptodromia was established by Stimpson in 1858' and the following species have been referred to it   C. nodipes Dromia nodipes Lamarck MilneEdwards Hist.

An interesting Pycnogonoid collected by Mr. Stearns apparently represents a new species.
In describing it I have followed in a general way the nomenclature of parts adopted by Dr. Hoek in his monograph of the Pycuogonoids collected by the Challenger Expedition.
I differ from him slightly however in terming the whole of the trunk from its junction with the proboscis to the commencement of the abdomen the cephalothorax instead of confining that term to the first segment of the trunk.
This appears to me to be a more correct use of the term as when the cephalon and thorax are united the cephalon ceases any longer to be the cephalon pure and simple and the thorax in the same way any longer the thorax pure and simple.
The whole then becomes the cephalothorax and any part of it is a part of the cephalothorax.
The following is a description of the species.

This is a very fine species mucli larger thau any otlier species of the genus yet knoyn.
The only other species which approach it in size are Ascorhynchus glaher and Ascorhynclms orthorhinchus.
It is nearly half as long again as Ascorhynchus glaber the larger of these two species.
It is closely allied to the latter species but differs from it in the following wellmarked characters  ' 1.
The proboscis is divided into two portions is truncated and not longitudinally furrowed while in A. glaher it is divided into three portions is sharply pointed and each of its three sides is longitudinally furrowed.
2.
The oculiferous tubercle bears four distinct eyes whereas in A. glaher it is entirely destitute of eyes.
3.
The surface of the whole body is covered with a very minute granulation whereas in A. glaher it is entirely smooth with the exception of the dorsal cephalothoracic spines.
It will be seen from the above description that this is a species of great interest.
The form to which it is closely related 1.
glaher was dredged in the Southern Ocean between the Cape of Good Hope and Kerguelen Island in 1.375 fathoms.
The species from Japan was obtained in shallow water.
The presence of eyes in A. Japonicus and the simple character of the proboscis divided into two portions instead of into three causes the question as to whether this species does not represent the ancestral type of A. glaher which may have become adapted to deep water and migrated southwards.
Dr. Hoek in his monograph of the Pycnogonida collected by the Challenger Expedition gives a list of the species then known.
The following species of Ascorhynchus have been described since all from Japan.
