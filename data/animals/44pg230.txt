A CATALOGUE OF THE FISHES OF GREECE, WITH NOTES ON THE NAMES NOW IN USE AND THOSE EMPLOYED BY CLASSICAL AUTHORS.
BY HORACE ADDISON HOFFMAN AND DAVID STARR JORDAN.

The first-named author of the present paper spent a large part of the spring and summer of 1890 in Greece.
Part of this time was devoted to making collections of the fishes found in the markets of Athens and to the study of the vernacular names now applied by the Greek fishermen to these fishes.
Each fish as obtained was preserved in alcohol, a number attached to it, and a record kept of the vernacular name attached to this number.
The persistence of vernacular names of fishes and other animals is known to be very great, and it may be safely assumed that the most of these names now heard in Athens are derived from those applied to the same species in the time of Aristotle.
It has been thought that a study of these names would tend to throw light on those applied to fishes by classical authors.
The fact that no such collection or comparison of names of fishes has yet been made is the justification of this paper.
A single catalogue of the fishes of Greece is known to me, that published by my friend, Professor Apostolides in 1883 (La Peche en Grece : par Nicolas Chr.
Apostolides).
This work contains numerous vernacular names and it has been largely drawn upon in the present paper.
In this paper is printed a systematic list of the fishes known from Greece, either on the authority of Apostolides or from my own collection, wuth the vernacular names and such notes on them as I am able to offer.
No one can be more fully aware than I am, of the unsatisfactory character of many things in this paper.
It was often difficult or impossible to make out with certainty just what Aristotle meant.
Some terms occurring over and over and evidently having a very definite meaning to him are obscure to us, and the meanings given in the dictionaries are only guesses.
A good illustration of this is the word n-o'^iufm, usually translated diaphragm.
We have no right to assume that Aristotle always, or ever, meant by this term the diaphragm, especially in those instances where it makes him entirely wrong in regard to the anatomical facts.
In those matters "which could be seen by dissection I feel convinced that Aristotle made the dissections for himself and reported what he saw.
He may not always have seen aright in nice point;;, and he certainly did not understand what he saw as it is understood in the light of modern science ; but there is no ground for assuming that he did not see what would be apparent to any one who took the least pains to look, even if with unpractised eye.
A striking confirmation of the correctness of his observation in matters of anatomy was aflTorded by the repeated statement that the fid-iiayo^ (Lophhis piseatorlus) has its gall bladder upon the intestine, not upon the liver.
A dissection of this fish by Dr. Charles H. Gilbert proved the statement of Aristotle to be correct.
I believe that a reading of Aristotle in the original accompanied by dissections of the animals in question would bring one to a much better understanding of his anatomical terms, which are much in need of some such elucidation.
It is quite otherwise when he comes to the habits of the fishes and other matters than anatomical knowledge.
Here he has to depend upon the observations of the fishermen and others, and what he has to say simply records the prevalent beliefs.
Of course much of this fisherman's lore is real knowledge gained from observation, but it has also a considerable share of myth.
Another great source of difficulty is corruption of the text.
Considering all the time and the vicissitudes that the Mss.
of Aristotle have passed through it is always more or less problematical as to whether in any given passage we have just what Aristotle said.
For the nomenclature and systematic arrangement of the species, the identification of my specimens, and for all matters purely zoological in character I am indebted to Dr. David S. Jordan, at whose suggestion the work was undertaken.
The specimens obtained are in the museum of the University of Indiana.
Explanatory jS'otes.
1.
The following order of statement has been adopted: (1) Scientific name by Dr. Jordan.
(2) M. G. (Modern Greek) name or names heard by me in Greece, if any ; each name followed immediately by a small figure in parenthesis indicating the number of specimens secured under that name.
(3) A reference to the page of Apostolides' book (La Peche en Grece par Nicolas Chr.
Apostolides, Athens, 1883), where the species is given, followed by the scientific name used by him, and the vernacular name or names given by him.
(4) The similar name or names from A. G. (Ancient Greek) authors, chiefly Aristotle, references to the places in their works where these names are found, and a gathering up of the chief things said about the fish in question, especially anything which might in any way help to fix the identity of the species.
Explanatory remarks and comments are thrown in wherever in each case it seems most suitable.
2.
Modern Greek names marked with an asterisk (*) were heard by me in the market at Athens, sometimes elsewhere in Greece, but do not occur in Apostolides' list.
3.
Names marked with a dagger (j) occur in Apostolides, but were not heard by me in Greece.
4.
Names not marked by any sign were both heard by me and found in Apostolides.
They are not marked if the variations in form are slight and insignificant, even if the forms are not identical.
5.
When the names are derived from other sources the source is given in connection with the name.
6.
The references to Aristotle are taken from the Index Aristotelicus of Hermann Bonitz, and, as there, refer to the ])age, column and line of the quarto edition of Aristotle's works issued by the Royal Academy of Prussia through Georg Reimer, Berlin.
The references to Athenaeus, mostly from the Vllth book, are given by book and section, Editio C. Tauchnitii, Otto Holtze, Leipzig, 1887.
7.
Species obtained by me in Greece are marked H. The list which follows is that of Apostolides, the species arranged in accordance with the views of American authors and the accepted rules of nomenclature applied to their names.

Aristotle, axuXiov, name of a fish, 565a 16-26 ; 566a 19.
According to Aristotle the ova of the a/.uUw are grown fast between the branches of the oviduct about the backbone ; as these ova increase in size they change their position and move around into one or the other branch of the oviduct, which is forked and grown fast to the u-o^wp.a (diaphragm, peritoneum) just as in other similar fishes.
The oviduct of both this and the other Galeodes has at a little distance from the u-o^atim a kind of white breasts (oviducal glands) which are not present when they are not pregnant.
The shells of their eggs are shaped like the tongues (reeds) of pipes (aukoi), and there are attached to them hair-like ducts.
The other yalzoi breed twice a year, but the av.olw only once.

According to Aristotle the yaXein^^re.
the long (jeXdyji with uncovered gills on their sides (sharks), as distinguished from the flat atX.dyr^ with uncovered gills underneath them (rays).
The^aAsoi'areovoviviparous, produce at the most three young at a time, and admit their oflspring iuto themselves (iuto their mouths) and let them out again.
The TrncxO.n?
and akw-zy.i(x<} do this especially, but others do not because of their roughness.
The yahoi have a mouth oj^ening wide (literally ' breaking back ').
T\\Q axaAlia^ (thorny) yakeo'i has its ova attached to the v-6ZiO!J.a (peritoneum [?])
above the oviducal glands, and when the ovum descends upon its having been loosed the young fish is produced.
In the same way generation takes jjlace in the ald>-7j^.
But the so-called smooth yalsoi have their ova between the branches of the oviduct like the ff/.ol'jr^.
The ova moving about descend into one or the other branch of the oviduct and the young are produced, having the umbilical cord attached to the oviduct, so that when the eggs are used up these fish seem to have an embryo j ust like the quadrupeds.
In the case of the a/.uUo., Avhich some call v^fifiiai yaXeoi (i. e. yakeoi dappled like a fawn, fawn-colored sharks), when the shell of the egg bursts and fiills off the young fish is born.
There are several kinds of yakeot, e. g. aartpuxq, y.z'^Tpv/rfi, d:/.wjOla^, lilo>i, -o'.y.iAo^, ay.uivM}^, a)M-exia^.
See Atlien.
vii, 43.
Iq 508b 17 ya}.2oi are mentioned among fishes which have many pyloric appendages, but this is thought to be a corrupted reading for y<j.}J/.
See above under references.
The yalzoi and yaho^uhi^, as d/.co-r^^ and yjjcu'^, and the flat fishes, vdpy.Tj, i3d-<iQ, Kz.tuua-0^ and zpoyu)-^ produce their young alive, having first produced eggs internally.
The form of the uterus (oviduct) must be seen from dissections.
The yaXzw^ have it different from one another and from the flat azhiyr^.
For in some cases the ova are grown fast around the back bone between the branches of the uterus (oviduct, f3(Tr^/)a), just as has been said in the case of the <yy.'jU(iy.
As the ova increase in size they move around.
The •uterus being forked and grown to the v-6^wij.a (diaphragm, peritoneum) just as that of others of this kind, the ova come around into one or the other branch of the uterus (oviduct).
Both the uterus of this and that of the other yaXsoetdsl<; at a little distance from the u-6'^u)>j.a.
have what resembles white breasts (oviducal glands) which are not present when they are not pregnant.
The ya'umoz:^ all have their gills double and five on each side.
They also have the gall bladder on the liver, and the two parts of the liver are independent, the beginning not being grown together.
The males differ from the females by having two appendages hanging about the vent.

The /5tV>j is one of the aeXdyji, has the gall on tlie liver, has a large tail and copulates belly to belly.
It breeds twice a year, in autumn and again about the setting of the Pleiades, producing seven or eight young each time.
It allows its young to pass in and out (of its mouth).
The phri seems to cross with the /5«ro9 and produce the fish called />:vwo«-«c.
This has the head and fore parts of the /5aro9 but the rear parts of the ph-q, as if born from both.
Like the oi>o9, /5ar«9 and 4'^irTa it buries itself in the sand and then waves the filaments in its mouth.
It changes its color to that of the rocks on which it is, or to that of its other surroundings, so that it is not easily seen.

NdpxTj means numbness, torpor, stiffness.
The verb '^apxdw means to grow numb, to be stiff, Lat.
torpere.
Arist.
gives the following points with regard to the vdpxr/ : It is a flat aiXfiyoQ and like all such has its gills underneath it and is ovoviviparous.
It has the gall on the liver, has a long spiny tail.
It has its dorsal fins transferred to its belly, where, on account of its shape, they will be more useful, and its helhj (ventral and pectoral [?])
fins near the head.
It has two fins near (or on) its tail.
For two fins it uses its flat edges.
The vfifr/.r, benumbing (yapxav izoiouaa) the fishes which it intends to catch, taking them into its mouth in the way which it has, feeds on these.
It buries itself in the sand and mud and captures the fishes swimming up to it, which it stuns {'^afr/.wj -oiet).
A proof that they live in this way is that they are often caught having in them the •/.sfrrpeo^, one of the swiftest of fishes, the >dpxrj itself being one of the slowest.
Some persons have been eye witnesses of their mode of capturing their prey.
It is well known that they stun people also.
It hunts little fishes for its food, catching them by rendering them numb Q/apyjh") and unable to move.
The •^dpxrj and pr^r^ spawn a little before the autumnal equinox.
They take their young into themselves (their mouths) and let them out again.
A large vdpxrj has been seen with about 80 young in it.
Aristotle frequently mentions it in close connection with rpuycuv, l^d-o^ and pii'r/, implying that they belong to the same general class.
See also Athen.
vii, 95, where the same facts with regard to its stunning power are repeated.
Theophrastus says it can send a shock even up through a fish-spear to a man's hand.

8 (Rata punctata).
The fidro^ is repeatedly mentioned in Aristotle.
4&9b 6, 489b 31, 505a 4, 540b 8, 565b 28, 566a 28 32, 599b 29, 620b 30, 695b 28, 696a 25, 697a 6, 709b 17, 746b 6.
According to Aristotle the [idroi form one division of the (rskdy-q, are flat, have a tail (^xipxa^ = tail like that of a quadruped.
The word xipxo?
is not applied to the tail of a fish, such as a sunfish, etc.)
; they have uncovered gills (no opercula), have no scales, but a rough skin ; they have no fins but " swim by means of their flatness itself," or, as is said in another j)lace, by means of the outer edge of their flatness.
They have their gills tinder them, whereas the ya/.sc6(hj have them in the side.
The flat selache with tails, as the /Sfitrov", rjioyu).!
and the like, copulate not only with belly to belly, but also by mounting with their bellies upon the backs of the females in those kinds in which the tail is not so thick as to be in their way.
Of the flat fish the [id-oq and Tpoym-j do not receive their young into themselves because of the roughness of the tail.
Some fishes lie quiet in the sand, others in the mud, keeping only the mouth above.
The T.eTj>fv.i>'., {id-oc and (rzlayjLl^rj lie hid during the wintriest days.
The o-mi^, fidrof, il<-7,Tza.
and {>b-ri bury themselves in the sand, and when they have made themselves invisible they wave (^paddsijtrat) those things in their mouths which the fishermen call " rodlets " {paCdia) or little wands.
None of the other fishes have been seen uniting in copulation with others not of their own kind ; but the /u'v/j and fidrn^ alone seem to do this ; for there is a fish called pvjdoaTo^, because it has the head and foreparts of the [jdzifi but the hind parts of the /'iVry, as if born from both of these.
The yolzai and yiutotuJslis, as the dlm-riz and xua*^, and the flat fishes, '^dp/.r^, fidra'i, Xzidoo-nq and zpoywj, are viviparous, having produced eggs (internally), i. e. are ovoviviparoiis.
Bari'i also occurs in Aristotle.
It may be merely a feminine form of /3«'-ro9 used as a name of female [idni'i.
1527b 41 43, 565a 22 27, 567a 13. "
The ay.uXia and [ja^ioz^ have shelly arrangements in Avhich is found an eggy fluid.
The form of the shell is like that of the tongues (reeds) of wind-instruments (pipes, anXui'), and there are hair-like ducts attached to the shells.
In the case of the n/.oAia, which some call M^Spiai yaXzoi, the young are produced whenever the shell breaks from around them and falls off"; but in the case of the (i(i-iDt^ whenever they lay the eggs the young comes forth from the shell, which has been broken off" from around it."

Cf.
also aeXaym.hi^, liXayo^ is a term much used by Aristotle in a broad sense to include a wide variety of fishes.
leXa/ax^g is also used, whether as equivalent to fjiXw/o?
or in a still more comprehensive sense, is not clear.
Pliny ix, 24 (78), says : " There is another kind of fiat fishes which have cartilage for the spine (pro spina), as the rrn'cp, pastinacce, sqxiatince, torpedo and those which the Greeks call by the names hovis (l^oo?
), lamia, aquila (asro?
), and ra7ia (^dzpayo^), in which number are also the sr/rta^i although these are not flat (^/ojii).
All these collectively Aristotle called asXAyji, he first having given them this name.
We (Latins) can not give them a distinctive name unless we may be permitted to call them cartilaginous (cartilaginea)."
I gather the following points from Aristotle: Any animal is called a (yi).ayo^ which, being without feet and having gills, is viviparous (or ovoviviparous).
All the askdyr^ except the [id-payoq are externally viviparous, having first produced eggs within themselves (i. e. are ovoviviparous).
Their uterus, or oviduct, is forked and extends to the o-oZoJiia (diaphragm, peritoneum).
The fJz/.dyri are fidzo^i, Tfi'jyw'yi, pi'-'T^, ,jul>^, Id'j.ta, d.£z6^, •^dfi/.r^, fld-payoi; and all the yahwo-i}.
They have uncovered gills ; some are elongated in form, e. g. the yakzui; others flat, e. g. the jSd-o'..
Some of the (Jz Adyrj do not have fins, viz., the flat ones and those having tails, such as iSdrois and t/jo/w'^.
These swim by means of the " flatness itself."
But the [-idpay u^^ has fins, and so do all which do not have the flat parts thin.
Some are rough, others smooth.
The viviparous fishes, such as the (jzXdyr^, have cartilaginous bones (are yoydpd/.a-Ala), but the oviparous ones have a spine like the backbone (pdyii) of quadrupeds.
The liver of the ffskdyvj becomes fatty and an oil is melted from it, although the <Tt)yi.yq themselves are very free from fat both in their flesh and abdomen.
They sleep at times so that they are eveu caught with the hand ; they take their young into their mouths, except the ^dTpayo<s, are purely carnivorous, and most of them have no pyloric appendages ; the female is larger than the male, and the males can usually be distinguished from the females by two appendages hanging near the vent.
All the <7c)M.y6drj have at the same time ova in great numbers above near the t3-«^w,aa, some larger and others smaller, while they already have embryos below.
They are rough and without scales.
They lie toi'pid during the wintriest days.
Galen vi, 737, derives the name (rikayoii from ai/M^, a bright light or blaze, or shining.
He says : " The skin of such creatures is rough and shining in the night, wherefore also some say they have been named (jOAyui.
from having nihi^ (a phosphorescence).

The larger yhhti^ lay their eggs in the deep places, some even a fathom deejD, but the smaller ones lay them in more shallow water, usually near the roots of a willow or some other tree ; also near the reed and the ^poov (some kind of a weed).
The growth of the yMwi^ from the egg is very slow, wherefore the male watches them forty or fifty days that the offspring may not be devoured by the little fishes which happen along.
The egg of the y/.fh'.g is, when laid, as large as a grain of vetch.
No pestilential (universal?)
disease attacks the fishes of rivers and ponds, but peculiar diseases fall on some of them, as the yM>ii especially.

The y/Myei'; in the shallows are destroyed in large numbers by being struck by the dragon-serpent.
The river and lake fish are best after the emission of the eggs and semen, when they recover their flesh.
The ykfhi'i is not good while pregnant.
In all the rest the males are better than the females, but the female ^Aavj^ is better than the male.
Of the river fishes the male y'Ad-yi'i bestows much care upon its young.
The female departs when she has laid her eggs, but the male, remaining where most of the eggs collect, keeps guard over them, affording no other assistance except preventing the other small fishes from seizing the offspring.
It does this forty or fifty days until the young, having grown, are able to escape from the other fishes.

From the Phaleric y.wolri<; are produced p-spopdihg, from these zptyioz^, and from these rpryiat.
The zpiyiat are caught only as they swim into the Pontus, but they are not seen coming out of it.
Whenever one is caught in the neighborhood of Byzantium the fishermen cleanse their nets thoroughly, because it is not customary for it to swim out (i. e. they cleanse their nets because the catching of one is so unusual a thing as to be considered an evil omen and contaminating).
The reason for this is that they swim up the Ister (Danube) to where it splits and then come down into the Adriatic.
This is proved by the fact that there the reverse happens ; for they are not caught going into the Adriatic, but only swimming out.

The lyxilo^ is elongated and smooth, has only two fins, these fins towards the gills, has four single gills on each side, has the gall on the liver, has a gullet {(rzon.ayi,^), but this gullet is small, has but little fat about the stomach and caul, is neither male nor female, and does not engender anything from itself, as none of them has ever been found with eggs in it.
What they call a difference of male and female in the ly/i/.o?, in that the so'called male has the head larger and longer and the female small and pug-nosed, is not a difference of sex but of species.
All male fishes have -milt (dopog) except the iy/J?.^^, but this has neither eggs nor milt.
The iyX^^'^i passes from the lakes into the sea.
They are not produced either from copulation or eggs.
In some marshy lakes when the Avater has all been drained off and the mud has been scraped out the eels (iy/i^.s'.
'^) make their appearance again w'hen the rain water collects.
They are not produced in the dry places, neither in the permanent lakes, for they live and are nourished by the rain water.
Some persons suppose they are produced from the little worms found in some iy/jAsc^.
This is not true, but they are produced from the so-called " entrails of the earth " (earth-worms), which originate spontaneously in the mud and moist earth.
Some (eels) have already been seen coming out of these (earth-worms), and others may be seen in those pulled to pieces.
But in the sea and in rivers such things are produced, especially where there is putrefaction, in the sea weed of the sea, and about the margins of rivers and ponds where the heat is intense.
The iy/Jhj^ requires pure water and soon suffocates in foul water.
The eel-raisers (i//j/j)Tf>6<^<i'.)
keep the w'ater constantly flowing in and out of their tanks.
Those who fish for eels (iy/J/.si'^') stir up the water.
The iy/J/.E'.g which have died do not come up and float on the surface like most fish, for they have the stomach (y.ouia) small.
(Possibly y.oO.ia, literally hollow, here means swimming bladder.)
A few of them have fat, but most of them have not.
They live five or six days out of the water, more when they are northern, fewer when southern.
If transferred in spring from the lakes to the tanks they die, but not so in the winter.
They do not endure violent changes of temperature, dying if plunged into cold water.
Some live seven or eight years.
The river Ijyilt'.^ take food, devouring one another and plants and roots, and whatever they find in the mud.
They feed mostly at night, but duriug the day they retire into the depths.
Those which men call the females are the better ; but they call them so by mistake, they being of different species.

All those fishes which are long and smooth, as the lyyjkvq and yi'iyyiKi^, have only two fins.
Some fishes have two gills on each side, the one single and the other double, as e. g. the yoyyfxx; and ffxdpd^.
Some of the yoyyixn hav^e the gall upon the liver, others below, separated from it.
A few of the fishes have a gullet {a-oij."/"O' ^^ 6S^'^® yjyypo?

Only those fishes which lay the crumbling spawn (jo (I'aOvfiw wov') have thin scales (le-ide^').
For the y>'>yyfi(»} does not have such spawn, neither does the ii.niiavMj.
nor the lyyjhj^.
The yoyypoi also have egg-masses (y-oi]imzo?
), but the egg-mass is not very apparent on account of the fat.
It has a long egg-mass just as serpents have.
But when placed upon the fire it makes its nature evident, for the fat smokes and melts but the eggs jump and crackle when squeezed out.
And besides, if a person feels and rubs them with his fingers the fat feels smooth, but the spawn rough.
Now some ytiyypoi have fat but no spawn, while others, on the contrary, have no fat and much spawn, as has just been described.
The -/.diiafjot (Spiny lobsters?)
overpower the yoyypoi ; for on account of the roughness of the y.dfiaGiii the yoyypoi do not slip away from them.
The y''>yyi>'n^ however, devour the -oXo-ixh?, for the -oXu-ods^ cannot manage them on account of their smoothness.
Some Tro/.o-ads'^ have their arms (^Tzhy-dya^, coils) eaten off" by the yoyy/xn.
The p.njiarm, op<f6<i and yoyypo?
also hibernate (^(fioXohmv, lie quiet or torjiid).
Frequently the xeffrpeli and the yoyypoc live when the tail has been taken away up to the vent.
The y.^fTrptn^ is eaten ofi" by the labrax and the yi'>yypu^ by the p.opav^a. '
The battle is to the stronger against the weaker, for the stronger devour the weaker.
Some of the fishes change their places from the open sea to near the land and from the land to the opeu sea, avoiding the extremes of cold and heat.

In the second reference Aristotle seems partly to contradict the above, saying, the sea serpent's color and body are similar to those of the yoyypoq except that it is of a duller color and more violent in its movements.
If it is caught and let go it quickly goes down into the sand, boring through it with its beak.

According to Aristotle the p.u(iav>a is a long fish, does not have a crumbling egg-mass, has no scales, eats flesh only, is alternately pelagic and littoral, lies torpid for a season, is stronger than the yoyYpoq and eats off the tail of the Y''>y'C [>'>■?-, has no fins, and uses the sea as serpents do the land ; {%.
e. moves through the sea iu the same way as serpents move over the ground); its gills are not articulated like those of other fish; it has four single gills on each side, has the gall bladder on the entrails and is long like a snake ; they copulate by twining around one another and bringing belly to belly like snakes, spawn at any and every season, lay many eggs, and the young grow rapidly.
"The (T;j.op(i>^ and the (Tij.nf>a'./a diflfer, for the (r/wpar^a is variegated and weaker, but the (riwpo'i is of uniform color and strong, and it is colored like the pine tree and has teeth both within and without.

It spawns in winter.
When it is time for it to spawn it bursts open and so the eggs come out ; for this fish has a sort of division (partition) under the belly and intestine (//rpov') just as the snakes called zoif/.vMu have.
After it spawns these parts grow together again.
Its eggs are spread around it just as in the case of the spiders, for the female [ithh^i lays them attached to herself, and if any one touches them they scatter.

In none of the references which I have examined in either Greek or Latin is there anything given, so far as I can see, which helps to identify the animal.

The >ccV«^^"i^ according to Aristotle, is one kind of xsfTTpso^.
It begins to be pregnant in November or December and is pregnant thirty days ; it has scales and is oviparous, feeds on mud or slime ; like all the xsffrpsl^ it is not carnivorous ; these (the xe^rr/^e??)
are the only fishes which are not carnivorous, and have never been caught with any flesh in their stomachs.
The fishermen never use flesh bait for them, but use barley-cake.
The zcffr/ycif all feed on sea-weed and sand.
The z^^aAo?, which some call /sAwi/, is a littoral fish.
The -/.icpaXot feed on mud, and for this reason they are heavy and slimy.
The winter is beneficial to most fishes, but not so to the zso-r/jeu?
and 7.i(paXo<i.
The z^f a/o?
especially suflfers from the rain and cold in winter.
Their eyes become white and the fishes become blind and light in weight, and finally die.
In the shallows at Nauplia and elsewhere many have been caught blind when there came severely cold weather.
The eyes of many were white.
Athen.
vii, 77-79 under the heading -/.taTpzo^ has many references to the -/.ifahi^, which is regarded as one kind of xscrrpsu^.
He says that Dorio in his work on fishes describes the marine division of the x£(TTp£i^ but does not consider the viYer xsa-psn^.
He makes the kinds of marine xearpso^ to be xicuXog and vr^TTig.
Hesychius, under the word xi<puAt)t, says some of the xsffTpel'^ are so called.
There is some confusion in regard to the relation of the xi<paXf)c and x£(7rpsl?, but in general the xiipakoi are sjwken of as a subdivision of the xz(7Tpe'><;.
In some places, however, they seem to be distinguished from one another.

The tunny {(Jnwo?, fem.

), is probably mentioned oftener than any other fish in A. G. writers.
Arist., Ow'^o^, 488a 6, 505a 27, 591a 11, 537a 21 23, 543a 12, 571a 12 8, 607b 32, 607b 28, 599b 9 sq., 602a 31, 543a 1 b 3, 571a 15 14, 598b 19, 597a 22, 557a 27, 598a 18, 602a 26, 1531a 30, 844a 29.

I glean the following points concerning the tunnies from Aristotle : The Oirr^in are migratory and run in schools, are smooth, purely carnivorous, and have the net thrown around them sometimes while asleep ; the female has a fin called dipo.jitu'i under the belly, but the male does not have it ; they are at times burst by their fat.
They live tw^o years.
The fishermen think this is proved by the fact that when the 0wA8e<i failed one year the Onwot also failed the next year.
They seem to be a year older than the -r,Xa[j.bdei.
The Of'r/'MH and (t/mij/iixh copulate about the first of April and spawn about the last of June or first of July.
They lay their eggs in a sort of sack.
The growth of the Ow'Ade'i is rapid, AVhen they spawn in the Pontus (Black Sea) there come from the eggs what some call (y/.n (>(>'') An.
'., but the Byzantiaus u.n'^ioz:'?
(growers), because they grow (jj-b'^dyo)) in a few days.
They go forth (out of the Pontus) in autumn with the Ow^-^ide^, but return in the spring, being already -rj/.a/j.ud£<;.
An old OuwM)f has been caught whose weight was fifteen talents (1350 lbs.
), and whose length was five cubits and a span (about 8 ft.).
The old ones are not good even for salt fish.
The (h'j>-^(i[ lie torpid in the depths of the sea in winter, and are plumpest after this hibernation.
They begin to be caught about the beginning of summer (the rising of the Pleiades), and are caught last at the setting of Arcturus (winter solstice?
).
The Ouwoi, most of all fishes, take pleasure in warmth and come to the sand near the land for the sake of the warmth, because they warm themselves and swim on the surface.
They spawn in the Pontus (Black Sea) and nowhere else, and but once a year.
The Ouwo^ is good to eat again after Arcturus (probably the rising of Arct., about Sept. 15), for during this season it ceases to be afflicted with the olfrroo^^^ because of which pest it is inferior during the summer.
The Ob'^'^m and cc<ftm are infested by the <n(7Tpu^ about the dog-days.
At that time they both have by their fins a sort of little worm called olfrz/io'^, like a scorpion and as large as a spider («,"«/'-"/ v").
These cause them such pain that the ?:v^c«?
leaps out of the water at times no less than the dolphin.
The Oowids'i and -rjla/jMs'?
enter the Pontus in spring and pass the summer there both for food and spawning.
They come out straightway after the Pleiad (probably the setting of the Pleiades, about Nov. 10).
If the wind is a southern one they swim out more slowly, but if northern more quickly, because the wind is then for wafting them on.
They swim into the Pontus, keeping close to favorable the land on their right, but they swim out of it keeping close to the land on the lejV The rry.o/j.dfx,'.
are weaker than the fh'woL and migrate earlier.
The ^y^-i^viV spawns in summer about the month Hecatombpeon near the vernal equinox.
It lays a sort of sack filled with many small eggs.
The above are, so far as I can make out, the main points which Aristotle reports concerning the Ouwoc and OovvctJs?.
Whether they are the same, the latter merely referring to the females, is not altogether clear.
It will be noted that some of the above statements are obscure and others contradictory, at least apparently so.

From there they scatter throughout the rest of the (Mediterranean) sea.

The IdCpa^ has scales and is oviparous, as all fishes with scales are, is carnivorous, has two fins on its back and two on its belly, has an especially acute sense of hearing, is often speared in daytime while sleejiiug, spawns twice a year, once in summer and once in winter, spawns chiefly " where rivers flow," has a stone in its head, and in consequence of this is especially apt to suflTer in winter, being frozen to death and cast ashore.
They are not good for food when pregnant.

Most of the fishes are male and female, but concerning the ifto^'ijK-M)^ and y/iyvri there is a doubt, for all of these which are caught have eggs in them.
The y/vrMu are purely carnivorous ; they often throw out their stomachs {y.oiXiai) when pursuing the smaller fishes, because the stomachs of ,fishes are near to their mouths and they have no gullet {nTotj.ayo'i).

The specimen sold me as (x-dpo?

I am inclined to think that the names (rapyo^, fj/.dpoi^ and a-dpog are used indiscriminately for any and all species of Diplodus.
Aristotle, 508b 17, has (T-dpo<}, but a vario lectio is a/.dpo^;.
He says the (T-dpog (or (Txdpo?
if we follow the other reading) has many pyloric appendages.
Athen.

One is from Epicharmus, in which (r-dpoq can not be a mistake for (i/.dpog, as both names occur connected by and, viz., " We fished for a-dpui and (jy.dpii'.r Cf.

According to Aristotle the (7/.dp<i<i has two gills on each side, one single and the other double, has its stomach shaped exactly like an intestine, seems to ruminate just as the quadrupeds do, is a bony fish, is the only fish whose teeth are not sharp and pointed, and is consequently with good reason held to be the only one that ruminates.
Athen.
vii, 113, under n/.dpn<;, quotes Aristotle as saying that it is (not) sharp-toothed, and solitary and carnivorous; it has a small mouth and tongue, not grown fast much, etc.
A passage plainly corrupt.
To make any sense out of it at all we must assume that the negative near the beginning of the quotation has dropped out, and replace it.
Otherwise it contradicts what Aristotle has repeatedly said elsewhere, and even contradicts the latter part of the passage itself, where it is said that the a/.dpoq is fond of seaweed and is baited with this.
The statement that the <T/.dpog chews its cud is made repeatedly in Aristotle and other ancient writers.
Nicander of Tlayatira says there are two kinds of <Ty.di>i>'., one of which is called o'^ia^, donkey-colored, the other aloXo?, brilliant.
This suggests a/.apoyaidapo, ' scarus-donkey,' a name given to one of my specimens of Diplodus vulgaris.
Moreover the names secured by me under D. vulgaris indicate that at the present time the names (Txdpog, (T-dpo^ and (Tdpyoq are all used more or less indiscriminately for all the species of Diplodus.

is a j^elagic fish, and of both it and the ydwrj the male had never been seen.
He says the most of the fishes are male and female, but concerning the ipoi'iprMi<} and ydy^-q there is a doubt, for all which are caught have eggs in them.
Again he says of those called ipof^p'iyoi no male has ever been seen, but only females, and these full of eggs.
But we have not yet trustworthy observation on this point.
The name means red or reddish, and the color of the fish must have justified the name.

It was a favorite food fish.
Athenaeus derives its name fioa^ from the word yS'f-yj', a cry or shout, and defends this form of the name and derivation against Aristophanes of Byzantium, who says: "We wrongly call the fish fiwxa (/5tti|), and ought to call it [ioin-a {'{i!
('noi^<), since being a little fish it has large eyes.
It should be fiowtl' = having the eyes of an ox."
[:i6u)(l' is compounded of fino'i, stem, /5(>(F) and w^'-, and appears in Homer in the feminine f )rm [iom-t'S as a common epithet of Hera.
The word means ox-eyed, large-eyed.
If this is the fish now called ftCo-a the authority of Aristophanes of Byzantium prevailed.
At any rate, the /5tt)| was a small fish with large eyes, having peculiar markings on its back, running in shoals, and admired by epicures.

A ri-totle says with regard to the ftdrjxiyo'i: "Inasmuch as the flat front part is not fleshy, nature has compensated for this by adding to the rear and the tail as much fleshy substance as has been subtracted in front."
The [-idrpayuq is called the angler.
He fishes with the hair-like filaments bung before bis eyes.
On the end of each filament is a little knob just as if it had been placed there for a bait.
He makes a disturbance in sandy or muddy places, hides himself and raises these filaments.
When the little fishes strike at them he leads them down with the filaments until he brings them to his mouth.
The i3dTf>o.y_(>i is one of the azhr/jj.
All the az/Ayq are viviparous or ovoviviparous except the iidrpayj>q.
The other flat a^hb/j] have their gills uncovered and underneath them, but the ^drpayo^ has its gills on the side and covered with skinny opercula, not with horny opercula like the fish which are not asXaywdrj.
Some fishes have the gall bladder upon the liver, others have it upon the intestine, more or less remote from the liver and attached to it by a duct.
Such are [id-payoq, t)Mnl\ (TU'^ayin^, (jp.hpav^a and '^icpia^.
(Proved true of Lophius piscatorius by a dissection by Dr. C. H.
Gilbert.)
The ftdrpayo^ is the only one of the asXdyri which is oviparous.
This is on account of the nature of its body.
For it has a head many times as large as the rest of its body, and spiny and very rough.
For this same reason it does not afterwards admit its young into itself.
The size and roughness of the head prevents them both from coming out (i. e. being born alive) and from going in (being taken into the mouth of the parent).
The fidzpayo^; is most prolific of the ff^Xdyrj, but they are scarce because the eggs are easily destroyed, for it^lays them in a bunch near the shore.
