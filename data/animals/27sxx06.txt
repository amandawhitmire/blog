ON THE BUTEONINE SUBGENUS CRAXIREX, GOULD.
BY ROBERT RIDGWAY.
The genus Buteo as restricted 1 is divided primarily into two very distinct groups, one (typical Buteo) having four and the other (Craxirex) having only three of the outer primaries emarginated on their inner webs.
The European B. vulgaris, Leach, the type of the genus, belongs to the first group ; its American allies are B. borealis (Gm.
), B. harlani (Aud.
), B. cooperi, Cass., B. lineatus (Gm.
), B. abbreviates, Caban., B. minutes, Pelz., and B. brachyura, Vieill.
; while the Old World contains more numerous representatives of the subgenus.
2 The subgenus Craxirex is peculiar to America, the majority of the species belonging to the southern continent.
North America possesses only C. swainsoni, Bonap., 1 At present we exclude from the genus Buteo the closely related forms named respectively Heteraetus, Kaup (type Spizaetus melanoleucus, Vieill.
), Urubitinga, Lafr.
(type Falco urubitinga, Gm.
= JJ.
zonura [Shaw]), Heterospizias, Sharpe (type Falco meridionalis, Lath.
), Antenor, Ridgw.
(type Falco unicinctus, Temm.
), Buteogallus, Less, (type Falco cequinoctialis, Gm.
), Leucopternis, Kaup (type Falco melanops, Lath.
), Asturina, Vieill.
(type Falco nitidus, Lath.
), Rupomis, Kaup (type Falco magnirostris, Gm.
), OnycJwtes, Ridgw.
(type 0. gruberi, Ridgw.
), Urubitornis, Verr.
(type Circaetus solitarius, Tschudi), and Harpy haliaetus, Lafr.
(type Harpyia coronata, Vieill.).
Busarellus, Lafr.
(type Falco nigricollis, Lath.
), placed in most of the systems in close proximity to Buteogallus, and often in the same genus, we consider to be far removed from any of the above genera, being more closely related to the Haliaetine forms, especially to Oypoictinia, Kaup (type Buteo melanosternon, Gould), of Australia.

B.
{Craxirex) Swainsoni has been usually regarded as the American analogue of the B. vulgaris, of Europe ; but B. lineatus is, in reality, the nearest New World relative of the latter, agreeing very closely in size, proportions, and details of structure, though very different in color.
B. borealis is also strictly congeneric with these two typical species.
7 and C. pennsylvanicus (Wils.
), except in the southern portion ; but Middle and South America have in addition to these (which are there winter migrants from the north), C. albicaudatus (Vieill.
), G. erylhronotus (King), G. poliosomus (Quoy and Gaim.
), and G. galapagoensis, Gould.
Among the species composing the subgenus Graxirex there is considerable variation in proportions and size, though nothing of greater than specific importance, since no two are exactly alike in the details of form.
G. swainsoni and C. albicaudatus have very long wings, reaching nearly to the end of the tail ; but the latter has a conspicuously longer and thicker tarsus than the former; G. erythronotus agrees wonderfully with C. albicaudatus in its colors and changes of plumage, but in form it is intermediate between that species and G. poliosomus.
On the other hand, there is quite a contrast between the great G. galapagoensis and the little C. pennsylvanicus : still, in the subgeneric character of only three primaries emarginated, even tail, etc., they all strictly agree.
Several names have been invented to designate these variations of form, but they are not admissible.
The synonymy of the subgenus stands as follows: Graxirex, Gould, Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle, Birds, 1841, 22 (type, Polyborus galapagoensis, Gould).
Tacliytriorchis, Kaup, Classif.
Saiig.
Vog., 1844, 143 (type, Falco pteroeles, Teuim., =Buteo albicaudatus, Vieill.).
Pacilopternis, Kaup, Isis, 1847, 329 (type, Falco pennsylvanicus, Wilson).
Authors have been exceedingly inconsistent in regard to the classification of the American Buteones.
Thus, one of our latest and best authorities, Mr. Sharpe, 1 places G. albicaudatus and Buteo abbreviatus together in the so-called genus " Tachytriorchis" (=Craxirex, Syn.
), composed, according to his arrangement, solel} r of these two species.
The latter of these, however, belongs to the group having four primaries emarginated, and is, consequent^, and for other reasons, a true Buteo.
The incongruity of arrangement is still further increased by the placing of C. galapagoensis, G. poliosomus, G. erythronotiis, C. albicaudatus, G. swainsoni, and C. pennsylvanicus in the genus Buteo (as separated from " Tachy trior chis"), and scattered among species of no 1 Catalogue of the Accipitres, or Diurnal Birds of Prey, in the collection of the British Museum.
By R. Bowdler Sharpe, London, 1874. near affinity, while Heteraetus melanoleucus (Vieill.)
heads the list!
Messrs. Sclater & Salvin, in their "Nomenclator Avium Neotropicalium" 1 (pp.
118-119), include all the species of Buteo and Graxirex in the genus Buteo, with the exception of B. brachyura, which is assigned to the special genus u Buteola," a procedure which is entirely unwarranted by the characters of the bird.
Mr. Gray, in his "Hand List of Birds" 2 (I., pp.
6-9), makes the distinction between the subgenus Buteo (as he restricts it) and its allies strictly a geographical one, no true Buteo belonging, according to his classification, to the American continent.
The subgenus Graxirex is made to include, besides the appropriate species, Buteo borealis, B. lineatus, B. cooperi, and Anterior unicinctus I The subgenus " Tachytriorchis" contains B.leucops ( = C. galapagoensis,juv.
), B. abbreviatus (given in the list as " 63 albonota<ms" and " 65 zonocercus"), besides B. u pterocles" (= albicaudatus), B. erythronotus, and B. poliosomus, which are true Craxireces.
Having thus explained the proper limits of the subgenus Graxirex, I now present a synopsis of the species, briefly showing the distinguishing characters of each.

Description.
Adult. "
Bluish slate-color above and below, a little clearer about the head and throat ; lores whitish ; upper and under tail-coverts white, with slaty-gray cross bars and mottlings of the same color ; tail white crossed with about nine narrow bands of slaty-gray, and a very broad subterminal band of slatyblack ; primaries black, externally shaded with silvery-gray, the secondaries entirely slaty-gray like the back, tipped with white ; primaries white at base of inner web, with remains of dusky slatecolored bars.
Total length 22 inches; culmen, 1.4; wing, 15.25 ; tail, 8.5; tarsus, 3.4."
(Sharpe, 1. c.) "Female (?
in changing plumage) : All over blackish slate-color, excepting the hinder neck, the entire mantle and upper scapulars, the centre of the breast, extending on to the chest and centre of the abdomen, all these rufous portions of the body more or less obscured with slate-color ; quills black, silvery-gray near the base, barred with black; inner face of quills ashy-white, with a few dusky crossbars ; lower back, rump, and upper tail-coverts ashy, the former slightly washed with rufous ; tail ashy-white, with about nine narrow bars and a broad subterminal band of slatecolor, less distinct below.
Total length 22.5 inches, culmen 1.75, wing 15, tail 9, tarsus 3.50."
(Sharpe, 1. c.) Young (from specimens in the United States National Mnseum): Tail brownish-gray, with more or less of a hoary cast, usually passing into grayish-white at the tip, and crossed by very numerous (more than fifteen) narrow, rather indistinct, somewhat oblique, bars of dusky becoming gradually obsolete basally, and very oblique on the inner webs.
Upper parts blackish-brown, variegated with deep ochraceous, especially on the wing-coverts, scapulars, and upper tail-coverts ; head streaked with the same ; secondaries and primaries obscurely banded with dusky and fading into paler at tips.
Lower parts ochraceous, the jugulum, breast, and sides longitudinally striped with blackish ; sides tinged with rust} r ; tibiae and crissum transversely spotted, or barred, with rufous ; a more thickly spotted belt across the abdomen and flanks.
Inner webs of primaries pure white anterior to their emargination, and immaculate, or very faintly barred.
Wing, 15.50-18.10 ; tail, 9.30-10.50 ; culmen, 1.00 ; tarsus, 3.25-3.55 ; middle toe, 1.50-1.90.
Remarks.
We are inclined to regard the plumage described by Mr. Sharpe as the female in changing plumage, as being in reality the adult female in full dress.
A specimen in the U. S. National Museum corresponds quite closely except that it is still more rufous, and has the tail as in the young plumage (described above) with the exception of a single feather of the new moult.
This specimen (No.
68,309, Nat.
Mus., Chile?
), which is unmistakably in transition plumage, may be described as follows: Tail dull gray, with a perceptible hoary wash, crossed by an indistinct subterminal band (about .50 wide), and by very numerous (more than fifteen) narrow bars of darker; these bars most distinct on the inner webs, which are white to a greater or less distance from their inner edge ; shafts pure white, except terminally ; remiges dull slaty, with a hoary cast, paler (not white) at tips, and crossed b}' numerous, distinct, narrow bands of blackish ; wing-coverts more dusky, and more or less variegated with rusty.
General color of the plumage rusty chestnut, much broken by lighter (ochraceous) and darker (brownish-black) spotting and barring the former color mostly marginal or terminal, the latter central on the feathers ; the chestnut is deepest and most uniform ou the back, lesser wing-coverts, and abdomen ; the ochraceous prevails across the breast, while on the scapulars the black transverse bars predominate ; on the head the pi'edominant color is black, the feathers being merely edged laterally with rufous; on the cheeks the black is nearly uniform.
Lining of the wing rich chestnut the rufous broken by darker and lighter spotting ; inner webs of primaries ash-gra} r , with indistinct, very narrow, deeper-gra}', oblique bars.
1 The tail-feather (middle one) of the new moult, completely grown, is colored as follows: The prevailing color is silvery-gray, but this changes gradually to white along the shaft, but toward the end this gives way to a subterminal band of deep black, about one inch wide, and distant half an inch from the end; the remainder, or gray portion of the feather, is crossed by about twelve narrow, zigzag bars of deeper gray, these becoming gradually more indistinct basally, where they are broken into a confused mottling.
A young male, supposed to be from Chile (No.
1624, Museum of the Wesleyan University, Micldletown, Connecticut) is colored as follows: Tail dull brownish-gray to the tip, crossed by numerous (more than fifteen) narrow bars of dusky; remiges dull brownishslate, distinctly banded with bars of dusk} T black; rest of upper parts nearly uniform blackish-brown, slightly variegated (more heavily on upper tail-coverts) with ocbraceous.
Head blackishbrown, faintly edged with ochraceous, with a large, plain, ochraceous area on the auricular region.
Lower parts (except throat) ochraceous-white, with sharply -defined, broad, longitudinal stripes of blackish-brown ; tibise with irregular hastate spots of rufous ; crissum with sparser, finer markings of the same.
Lining of the wing ochraceous-white, with large but not crowded spots of brownisb-black ; inner webs of primaries white, marbled along the edge with slate.

Diagnosis.
Dimensions.
Wing, 14.25-16.30; tail, 7.30-9.00; culmen, .83-1.00 ; tarsus, 2.95-3.50 ; middle toe, 1.30-1.50.
Form: Third or fourth quill longest ; first intermediate between eighth and ninth.
Tail even in the adult, slightly rounded in the young.
Color: Adult, tail pure white (the lateral feathers scarcely tinged with ash), crossed near the end by a subterminal band of uniform black about 1.00 wide ; the white portion crossed by fine lines or narrow bars of plumbeous.
Above, including the rump, and sides of the neck, mostly or wholly uniform plumbeous ; throat, cheeks, and rest of lower parts pure white, the sides (always), frequently the abdomen and usually the tibiae more or less barred with plumbeous.
%.
Upper parts entirely uniform plumbeous, without any rufous.
?.
Back and scapulars uniform bright rufous.
Young.
Tail hoary ash, uniform, or growing gradually paler basally, with a narrow dusky subterminal band, and narrowly barred to the base with dusky, these bars sometimes nearly obsolete or broken into an irregular mottling.
Above blackish-brown, much variegated, especially on the wing-coverts, scapulars and upper tail-coverts, with ochraceous or rufous.
Lower parts ochraceous or ochraceous-white, the middle of the breast usually inmaculate, but the sides of the breast, the sides and the abdomen marked with broad transverse bars of rusty or longitudinally cuneate spots of brownish-black ; the breast sometimes with narrow streaks of the same ; tibiae and crissum with narrower rusty bars, or hastate spots.
Remarks.
In the adult there is sometimes an entire absence of bars on the white portion of the tail.
One adult female has a few rufous feathers on the sides of the breast.
A young male is marked as follows : Tail hoary ash, narrowly barred to the base with darker, and 98 with a narrow subterminal dusky band.
Upper parts blackishbrown, much variegated, especially on the wing-coverts, scapulars, and upper tail-coverts, with reddish-ochraceous or rufous.
Lower parts deep ochraceous, the sides of the breast, sides, and abdomen, with large, longitudinal, cuneate spots of brownish-black ; middle of the breast with narrow lines of the same ; tibia?
and crissum with large hastate spots of rusty.
Young ?.
Tail whitish-ash, becoming paler basalty, mottled with darker and with a badly defined subterminal band of dusky.
Entire back and scapulars plain bright rufous, and the wiug-coverts, rump, upper tail-coverts, and head and neck, much tinged with the same.
A young female in Mr. Lawrence's collection differs only in the coloration of the lower parts, the ground-color of which is ochraceous-white ; the pectoral area is immaculate ; the abdomen, sides, flanks, tibiae, and crissum are barred with rusty the bars narrower on the tibia?, and more distant on the crissum; there is a distinct rictal " moustache" of black.

Habitat.
The whole of Middle America, north to Mirador (on the eastern side), Colima (west coast) and the City of Mexico (central plateau); eastern South America as far as Paraguay.
Diagnosis.
Wing, 14.50-18.00; tail, 1.
70-10.50; culmen, .951.05; tarsus, 3.30-3.70; middle toe, 1.55-1.80.
Form: Third quill longest; first intermediate between sixth and eighth.
Tail even in adult, slightly rounded in young.
Color: Adult, tail white (the lateral feathers much tinged with ash), crossed by a broad subterrninal band of black; the white portion crossed by faint lines or narrow bars of plumbeous.
Above dark plumbeous; rump and lower parts pure white; throat plumbeous-black, or bluish-plumbeous.
Flanks, rump, and lining of the wing usually faintlj' barred with ashy, dusky, or rufous.
%: Lesser wing-coverts with a restricted patch of rufous on the anterior portion; longer scapulars strongly tinged with rufous.
9: Rufous patch on lesser wingcovert region extended over nearly the whole of its area; longer scapulars scarcely tinged with rufous.
Young: Tail hoary grayish (the inner webs mostly white), growing gradually darker terminally, and passing narrowly into dull whitish or rufous at tip; crossed with numerous narrow and very obscure bars of darker, these growing gradually obsolete towards the base.
1 General color brownish-black, the lower parts more or less variegated (most conspicuously on the posterior portions, and on middle of the breast) with ochraceous or whitish.
Remarks.
The identity of specimens of the two plumages described in the diagnosis as " adult" and " young" is proven by specimens in which part of the tail feathers are of one plumage and part of the other.
Such a specimen is in Mr. Lawrence's collection from the city of Mexico.
The older individuals in the immature dress are colored as follows : Tail hoary ash, growing darker terminally, and passing narrowly into brownish-white at the tip the inner webs mostly white; the terminal half with just descernible obscure bars of darker, these becoming gradually obsolete on the basal half; sometimes they are entirely obsolete for the full length of the outer webs.
Upper tail-coverts pure white, usually immaculate, 1 These bars are sometimes entirely obsolete on the outer webs.
100 but sometimes barred ; inner webs of primaries ashy, the two or three outer ones more whitish, and sometimes barred with dusky.
In males, the middle of the breast, the tibiae and crissum, are usually ochraceous irregularly spotted with brownish-black.
The darker-colored individuals in this stage are distinguishable from the dark examples of the young of C. swainsoni only by the very much stouter and longer tarsi.
The adults vaiy but little.
The white of the jugulum usually reaches forward medially into the plumbeous of the throat, and in one ($ ad.
Tehuantepec, Mexico; Sumichrast) it extends interruptedly, however to the chin.
Another male from the same localit} T has the scapulars almost entirely rufous, with black shaftstreaks.
The white of the lower parts in the adult is of a pureness and continuity strikingly characteristic of this species.
A very young specimen from Paraguay has the tail more brownish, more distinctly barred, and more ochraceous on the tip ; the upper tail-coverts are ochraceous marked with broad crescentic bars of blackish, and the upper parts generally are variegated with ochraceous.

color, and usually predominates, but is sometimes much less in amount than the black; the tail is the same as in the adult.
a.
Normal phase.
Adult: Above continuous blackish-brown, the feathers usually with somewhat paler borders ; outer scapulars and upper tail-coverts very rarely tinged with rufous the latter usually more or less barred with white or ashy; occipital feathers white beneath the surface; primaries plain brownish-black, without trace of bars on outer webs.
Throat and chin more or less white, usually in form of a sharply-defined patch; jugulum and breast brown, generally plain, very rarely spotted with whitish, the tint varying from rufous () to the color of the upper parts ( 9 ).
Other lower parts varying from white to ochraceous (rarely almost rufous), generally more or less barred, or spotted transversely, with dark brown or rufous very rarely immaculate; crissum usually immaculate, but sometimes with faint and distant bars.
Lining of the wing white, sometimes tinged with ochraceous; often immaculate, but generally sparsely (never heavily) spotted with rufous or brown.
Under surface of the primaries cinereous (the outer two or three more whitish) sometimes plain, sometimes indistinctly barred with darker.
% .
Breast-patch rufous with darker shaft-streaks.
9.
Breast-patch dark grayish-umber, or blackish-brown (like the back).
Young: Above brownish-black, with a faint purplish lustre, the feathers all paler on their borders; wing-coverts and scapulars more or less variegated with ochraceous or whitish spotting, this usually very conspicuous on the longer scapulars; upper tailcoverts ochraceous or whitish (their inner webs more brownish), barred with dusky.
Tail as in the adult.
Ground color of the head, neck, and lower parts, ochraceous, varying in shade from very deep cream-color to nearly white; the feathers of the head, neck, anterior part of the back, and sides of the breast with medial longitudinal tear-shaped spots of brownish-black; lower parts generally spotted, sometimes everywhere, with black, and occasionally immaculate.
b. Melanistic j^hase.
Adult : Prevailing color plain blackish-brown ; the tibite, lining of the wings, and sometimes the breast, inclining, more or less, to rufous.
Crissum usually white, sometimes immaculate, generally barred with rusty or blackish ; occasionally with dusky and whitish bars of equal width.
No white on the throat, or else but little of it.
Young: Brownish black, variegated with ochraceous spotting, in amount varying with the individual.
Remarks.
The above diagnosis is based upon upwards of one hundred specimens, and ma}' be considered as covering every phase, seasonal, sexual, and individual, assumed by the species.
So great is the extent of individual variation, that, taking a series of specimens of either plumage, scarcely two can be found which are alike in all their markings, especially those on the lower surface of the body.
The plumage of the upper surface, however, is so constant, that, taking ever so large a series of adults, and turning them on their bellies so that the backs of all are presented to view at once, a specimen in the least degree aberrant is very rare, while one very noticeably different can scarcely be found ; and when such a one is detected, it is generally found that the difference is a seasonal, rather than an individual, one.
Thus, in specimens which have just completed the new moult, some of the longer scapulars are seen to be slightly variegated with oehraceous on their edges ; while in those in which the feathers have become old, these paler mottlings and edges are " worn" off, causing a very uniform shade of dark grayish-brown to prevail continuously over the upper parts, though each individual feather fades gradually in depth of color on its borders.
As a rule, the brown of the upper parts is a shade lighter and more grayish in the males than in the females, and there is apt to be a slight rufous edging to the feathers of the neck, as well as a tinge of the same on the upper tail-coverts ; while not unfrequently the longer scapulars have their exterior edges tinged with rufous.
But these differences between the sexes are so exceedingly slight as to be appreciated only upon actual comparison of specimens, and even then do not prove sufficiently constant to be considered of any importance.
Reversing the position of the specimens, so as to present their lower surfaces to view, they can be immediately placed into two groups, distinguished by the color of the patch on the breast.
One lot has this patch clear, rather light, cinnamon-rufous; the other has it dark grayish-brown, the same color as the upper parts.
Upon examining the labels, the first series is found to be composed entirely of males, while those of the second are all females.
In a series of nine normally-colored adult males, all but two have the rufous breast-patch abruptly defined posteriorly, against the white of the posterior lower parts, the outline being semicircular and pretty firm.
The remainder of the lower surface is white, with little, if any, general ochraceous tinge ; the inside of the tibias is quite strongly washed with this color.
One specimen (No.
161 Mus.
R. R., Wahsatch Mountains, Utah, June 27) is almost immaculate beneath, posterior to the clear cinnamon-rufous breast patch, there being only a very few scattered and minute hastate specks of rust on the abdomen.
The remaining five are more or less speckled or barred underneath, the amount of these markings varying with the individual the lightest-colored being almost as continuously white as that just described, the darkest having the abdomen thickly, though rather faintly, barred.
Two of the specimens have the bars on the upper portion of the abdomen (just below the rufous pectoral area) darker rusty and connected by longitudinal streaks of blackish running along the shafts of the feather.
The tibiae may be either immaculate or faintly barred; but the crissum is immaculate in all.
The two remaining specimens of the series are quite aberrant in the plumage of the lower parts; thus, No.
65,918, Long Coteau River, Dakota (September 9, 1873), has the abdomen, sides, and tibiae heavily barred with rufous, of a more rusty, or less ochraceous, tint than that of the breast; these bars are rather broader than the intervening whitish ones, are very irregularly defined, and become narrower and fainter on the tibiae ; the crissum has a small and very faint transverse bar near the tip of each feather.
The feathers of the sides have blackish shaft-streaks.
No.
5,576, North Platte (August 21, 1856), has the rusty-rufous of the breast continued back to the anal-region and tibiae ; the abdomen, sides, and flanks are variegated only by the sharply-defined black shaftstreaks on each feather ; the tibiae and anal-region are transversly broken by paler bar-like " washings ;" the crissum is white with distant bars of rusty.
A series of nineteen adult females in the normal plumage presents much greater and more complicated variations than does that of the male birds.
Fourteen of them have the lower parts posterior to the breast-patch more or less ochraceous (the ground color varying from buff to rufous), and everywhere, except on the crissum, heavily barred with darker rusty and blackish-brown ; the prevailing form of these bars varies with the individual; in all but one, their direction is decidedly transverse, but as a rule they are neither sharply defined nor regular ; on the tibia?
they are narrower, fainter, and more decidedly rufous ; on the upper part of the abdomen they are more or less modified in shape by an increased breadth along the shafts of the feathers, sometimes running: together, and then forming a median chain of diamondshaped spots, which are usually more blackish than the other markings.
Some specimens have these diamond-shaped spots, the characteristic pictura of the lower parts, in wdiich case the transverse bars are indistinct, if not obsolete, but the strong transverse barring is the rule.
In the darker of these specimens there is a gradual transition between the uniform brown of the jugulum to the broken tint of the lower breast; and in these specimens the white of the throat is more or less streaked with dark brown.
In nine of the fourteen specimens, however, the dark grayish umber jugular area is abruptly defined, with a firm semicircular outline, against the immediately lighter region posterior to it, while the throat of these specimens is plain white, in the form of a well-defined patch.
The remaining five specimens differ decidedly from the series above described.
Four of them agree in having the lower parts posterior to the breast-patch almost free from markings.
The color of these parts is alike in all, and is a creamy white (less pure than in the very light-colored males), witli the tibiae, especially their inner sides, more strongly ochraceous.
One of them is so nearly immaculate, that a dozen or so minute hastate specks of brown scattered over the upper portion of the abdomen constitute all the variegation of the lower surface.
The most heavily spotted one has large transverse spots along the sides, and more irregular, even some longitudinal, ones along the middle portion of the lower bi'east.
This example differs from the others in having the brown of the jugular patch broken up by a conspicuous spotting of ochraceous-white, this most distinct along the median line.
No.
1,271 (Mrs. C. E. Aiken), El Paso, Colorado, May 6, is almost exactly similar.
The remaining specimen is a very remarkable one in every way, and is entirely aberrant and exceptional in its peculiar features.
The relative position of the areas where light and dark markings respectively prevail is exactly reversed, the pectoral region being white, with a longitudinal tear-shaped spot of blackish-brown on the tip of each feather, while the abdomen, sides, and flanks are so heavily marked with more or less confluent transverse spots and bars of dark brown, that this forms the predominant color of those parts; the tibiae are finely and regularly barred with dark brown.
The style of coloration of the lower parts of this specimen strikingly calls to mind that of the adult, normally colored Archibuteo lagopus (vax.sancti-johannis).
The gular region is white, with a conspicuous medial stripe of dark brown, while it is bordered on either side by a broader one of the same color.
The ear-coverts are so much streaked with white that this color prevails ; while the neck is very heavily spotted with the same at the bases of the feathers.
The measurements are as follows: wing, 16.70 ; tail, 9.00; culmen, .95; tarsus, 2.90; middle toe, 1.65.
This specimen was obtained May 29, 1868, on the Wahsatch Mountains, Utah, by Mr. L. E. Ricksecker.
The sex is queried as male upon the original label.
Altogether, it is so far out of the usual range of variation which obtains in the species, that it may possibly eventually prove to belong to another species.
The melanistic plumage grades from individuals only a little darker beneath (with less-defined bars) than the clearly-barred ones described above, up to others which are entirely black, except the crissum and tail.
The latter is always as in the normal plumage, while the former always has some white this forming the prevailing color in seven out of eight examples.
Of the eight specimens before me, only two have the crissum immaculate white, and have much white on the throat.
One of them has the tibiae and anal-region narrowly barred with light rusty.
Three others have the white of the crissum marked with a very few, distant, and faint bars of rusty.
Two others are broadly barred with blackishbrown, while the remaining one (No.
12,117, Mazatlan, Western Mexico) has these black bars so much wider than the white ones that the crissum seems black barred with white, rather than the reverse.
Two specimens (No.
12,117, Mazatlan, and No.
22,569, Onion River, Arctic America) are absoluteby uniform and continuous brownish-black, except the crissum.
No.
6,455, Nebraska, has the breast and tibiae bright rufous, the lining of the wing rusty white.
A male from Arizona in Mr. Aiken's collection has the lining of the wing deep rusty rufous with blackish shaft-streaks, the breast and tibiae blackish-brown.
The plumage of the young varies between great extremes, and were it not for the specific characters at once recognizable in the peculiar proportions, and characteristic details of structure, certain individuals could not be identified at all.
There is, however, an average style of which the specimen described on p. 112 (No.
10,161) is a fair representative.
Upwards of twenty specimens have been examined, and sixteen are now before me.
Of the series now under consideration, twelve have the ground-, and prevailing, color of the head, neck, and lower parts, soft, fine ochraceous-buff, or deep cream-color.
Only one is without spots on the lower parts posterior to the jugulum.
On two, the black spotting nearly equals in extent of color the ochraceous ;' the tibiae are heavily spotted, upon a rusty ochraceous ground.
In one of them, the crissum is also distantly barred.
The remainder of the series have the crissum immaculate, five of them have the tibia?
more or less barred, while no two are alike in the quantity of spotting on the breast, abdomen, etc., or in the exact shape and distribution of the spots though the whole series is intermediate in these respects between the two specimens mentioned above as the light and dark extremes of the series, and which were taken from the same nest.
Three others differ from the above series in having the aroundcolor of the head, neck, and lower parts nearly white, with only a slight tingeof ochraceous, and with the few markings of the lower surface restricted chiefly to the sides of the breast.
The}' are from Buenos Ay res, Costa Rica, and Nebraska ; and though from localities so remote from each other, the}' are almost as nearly duplicates of each other as is ever seen but of these specimens, I have more to say beyond (see page ).
The remaining one is a young example of the melanistic plumage ; and in it the black markings of the lower parts of course predominate over the light ones.
The ground-color ma}', in fact, be considered as brownishblack, variegated w r ith ochraceous.
The upper parts vary with the individual in the proportionate 1 One of these specimens was taken from the same nest along with the very light-colored one mentioned.
Their parents were a very white-bellied male, and a very uniformly blackish female !
amount of black and ocbraceous, though the former is always greatly in the excess.
The latter is not un frequently absent, but a conspicuous spotting and bordering of ochraeeous may be taken as the rule, exemplified by probably 80 or 90 per cent, of the specimens.
Two specimens from Wisconsin, in the Museum of the Philadelphia Academy, differ from any in the National collection, though they are as unlike each other as any which I ever compared.
One of them (the type of B. bairdii, Hoy) is unusually light-colored underneath, and very continuously blackish on the upper surface.
The lower parts are light buff or cream-color, with a few triangular spots and shaft-lines of black on the sides of the breast ; the lining of the wing is entirely immaculate.
The other specimen (Menonomee Marsh, near Milwaukee, spring of 1851) is just the opposite extreme in plumage, being unusually dark for a young bird.
On the upper parts, the continuity of the black is scarcely broken ; while beneath, the black spots are so large as to cover nearly the whole surface.
The pileum, and nape and broad " mustache" stripe from the rictus down to the jugulum, with nearly the whole pectoral region, unbroken black, leaving only the gular region and sides of the head pale, but even these places are thickly streaked.
The measurements are as follows: Wing, 15.00; tail, 8.80; tarsus, 2.35 ; middle toe, 1.50.
A specimen from Iowa (No.
59,052, L. E. Ricksecker) is like the average western style.
A young female from Arizona (September 23, Captain Charles Bendire, U. S.
A.)
in Mr. Aiken's collection differs from the type of U B. bairdii" only in deeper shades of colors as nearly as my memory of the latter justifies comparison.
The Massachusetts specimen in the possession of Mr. Brewster I have seen ; it is very dark, closely resembling, according to my recollection of it, the blank example from Wisconsin described above.
The following detailed descriptions are taken from the best representatives of each stage of plumage in the collection : Normal phase.

The specimen from Buenos A}Tes (No.

H. Hudson) was labelled by Mr. Sclater " B. albicaudatus," and so published (Proc.
Zool.
Soc, Lond., 1869, 634).
This species, however, though belonging strictly to the same section of the genus with B. swainsoni, and being in fact its nearest ally, is yet very distinct, having altogether larger and longer tarsi.
The National Museum contains a fine suite of this species, illustrating the variations to which it is subject.
This specimen is exactly like the Costa Rican one just described.

Melanistic Phase.
Adult, = B. insignatus, Cassin, and B. fuliginosus, Sclater.
Male (No.
12, 117, Mazatlan, Mexico; Colonel Abert) : Entirely fuliginous-black, darkest on head and back; no white on forehead.
Tail cinereous-umber, crossed with seven very regular and continuous bands of black, the subterrainal one of which is broadest.
Lower tail-coverts, and larger under wing-coverts, with transverse bands of dull white ; lining of the wing unvaried black ; under surface of primaries silvery-white, that portion beyond their emargination black, the whitish portion crossed by distant, very indistinct transverse bars.
Third quill longest ; fourth and fifth scarcely shorter, and nearly equal; second equal to sixth; first shorter than eighth.
Tail even; scutellre of the tarsus very faintly defined, or, in fact, scarcely detectable (probabty accidental).
Wing, 13.00; tail, 1.00; tarsus, 1.95; middle toe, 1.55.
Male (22,567, Onion River; R. McFarlane) : Entirely brownishblack, whole under surface of wings included; lower tail-coverts equally barred with white and black.
Tail blackish-slate, narrowly paler at the tip, and crossed with numerous oblique bars of dusky black ; upper tail-coverts barred obsoletely with lighter slatybrown.
Wing, 15.00; tail, 8.00; tarsus, 2.20; middle toe, 1.50.
Fourth quill longest; third, next; second, shorter than fifth ; first, slightly shorter than eighth.
Female (12,927, Utah Valley, July; C. S. McCarthy): Similar; lower tail-coverts white, tinged with rusty, and barred with brown ; tibiae tinged with chestnut.
Wing, 16.50 ; tail, 8.80 ; tarsus, 2.60 ; middle toe, 1.65.
Third and fourth quills equal and longest ; third shorter than fifth ; first equal to eighth.
The melanistic specimen from Mazatlan (No.
12,117) described above agrees perfectly with Mr. Selater's excellent figure of his B. fuliginosus above cited, and the onby discrepancy in the description is in the measurements, those given for the B. fuliginosus being, wing, 12.00, tail, 6.50, and tarsus, 2.60.
The difference in the length of the wing is certainly not great, while the discrepancy as regards the length of the tarsus it is probable results from a different mode of measurement.

Diagnosis.
Adult: Upper surface dark umber-brown, the feathers gradually paler toward edges ; on the back, the feathers more uniformly dusky, causing a prevalent blackish appearance.
Rump and upper tail-coverts blackish vandyke-brown, the latter tipped with pure white, and with a concealed bar of the same, about the middle of each feather.
Tail dull black, with an indistinct terminal band of dull brown, this fading terminally into whitish ; across the middle of the tail a broad band of dull light umber (in some individuals approaching dull white) about three-fourths of an inch in width; about as far anterior to the main bantl as this is from the tip is another much narrower and less distinct band of the same color, crossing jnst beyond the ends of the coverts, or concealed by them.
Primaries uniform brownish-black, fading on the terminal edge into pale brown.
Head above, and broad but inconspicuous "mustache," running from the rictus downward across the cheek, dull black ; the crown posteriorly, with the occiput and nape, having the dull black much broken, caused by the lateral streaks of dull rufous on all the feathers ; this dull rufous tint prevails on the rest of the head and neck, as well as the breast, leaving the lores and chin and lateral portion of the frontlet alone whitish; throat streaked with blackish.
Beneath dull browmish-rufous, that of the breast almost unvariegated ; medially, however, are roundish spots of white on opposite webs, but these are not confluent; posteriori}', these spots become gradually more numerous and more transverse, forming on the flanks transverse bands, almost continuous; on the tibia?
the white prevails, the rufous bars being more distant, and connected only by a brown shaft-line; lower tail-coverts with less numerous, transverse spots of dull rufous.
Lining of the wing ochraceous-white, with sparse, rather small, irregularly deltoid spots of dull rufous; under surface of the primaries unvariegated white, as far as their emargination, beyond which they are black.
Fourth quill longest ; third a little shorter ; second intermediate between fifth and sixth; first about equal to the ninth.
Female (extremes 30,969, Brookline, Mass., and 30,895, Mirador, Mexico the latter the larger) : Wing, 11.00-11.30; tail, 6.80-7.10 ; tarsus, 2.30 ; middle toe, 1.30.
Male (32,309, Moose Factory, Hudson's Bay Territory) : Wing, 10.50 ; tail, 6.30 ; tarsus, 2.30 ; middle toe, 1.20.
Young male, second year?
(39,106, Remedios, Cuba, June; N. H. Bishop): Upper parts similar to adult, but a reddish tint appreciably washing the edges of the interscapulars and (less noticeably so) the scapulars.
Bands on tail nearly as in adult, but very near the base is a fourth, very narrow and faintly de.
fined, pale band, while the bases of all the feathers are much mottled with white.
Dull rufous of the breast not continuous, but in the form of large longitudinal broad spots, occupying the greater middle portion of each feather; abdomen, sides, and tibioe with smaller and more cordate spots of dull rufous ; the lower tailcoverts immaculate ; the decided ochraceous tinge beneath, deepest posteriorly.
Young, first year (11,984, Washington, D. C.) : The blackish above is much variegated, being broken by narrow rusty borders to the interscapulars, rump-feathers, and lesser wing-coverts, the broader and more ochraceous borders to scapulars and greater wing-coverts, and partially concealed whitish spotting on the former.
Upper tail-coverts white, with broad bars of blackishbrown ; secondaries and primaries edged terminally with whitish.
Tail dull umber-brown, growing darker terminally ; narrowly tipped with white, and crossed with six obscure, narrow bands of dusky, the (concealed) bases of all the feathers white.
Superciliary region, cheeks, chin, throat, and entire lower parts, delicate pale ochraceous, or whitish cream-color ; a conspicuous " mustache," a medial longitudinal series of streaks on the throat, with large longitudinal ovate spots on sides of breast, cordate spots on sides and flanks, and sagittate spots on tibiae, clear blackish-brown.
The ochraceous deepest on the abdomen and crissum.
Wing beneath as in adult.
A very young bird, scarcely fledged (33,598, Milltown, Me.
; G. A. Boardman), differs from the last in a much more continuous black shade above, the deeper ochraceous beneath, and larger, as well as more numerous, blackish spots beneath.
Remarks In the adult plumage of this species, the principal variation is in the continuity or distinctness of the anterior light band on the tail, and the extent and depth of shade of the brown beneath.
The first feature is characteristic of most specimens, only one (55,980, % , Costa Rica) being without it; it is broadest and most conspicuous, as well as less concealed hy the coverts, in the females, and this appears to be the principal sexual difference.
The dull brownish-rufous of the under parts is most prevalent in a specimen from Mirador, Mexico (30,895, ?
?
September; Dr. Sartorius), in which specimen the breast is almost continuously of this color, and the lower tail-coverts are strongly barred (or transversely spotted) with the same ; the ground-color beneath is also more ochraceous than in any other individual.
In the Costa-Ilican specimen (the one lacking the anterior tail-band), the brown beneath is quite different from that of the others, being of a much more ashy shade ; the lower tail-coverts are also immaculate.
The brown markings beneath are most sparse in 20,389, from Coban, 119 Vera Paz (January ; 0.
Salvin) ; in this, also, the tail-bands are very distinct, and almost white.
A young bird from Costa Rica (30,412 ; Dr. Frantzius) is exactly similar to No.
27,048, from Fort Garry, Selkirk Settlement.

The fish is a representative of the Dipnoi, or double breathers, like the Lepidosiren, being provided with both lungs and gills.
The genus was long ago named by Agassiz, from isolated teeth found in the Triassic and Jurassic rocks of Europe.
The C. Forsteri was discovered only a few years since, and was referred to Ceratodus by Dr. Giinther, from the near resemblance of the teeth of the fish to the fossils described under that name.
Another specimen, presented by Dr. S. C. De Vesy, of Williamstown, Dauphin Co., Pa., appears to be a fitting companion to the former.
It consists of a fragment of coal shale, from the coal mines of Williamstown, with an impression which looks as if it might be that of the tail of a relative of the Ceratodus, or of a huge tadpole.
Among the many enigmatic impressions occurring in the coal shales, this is better defined than usual.
It is 8f inches long and 6 inches at the widest part.
The accompanying figure is an outline sketch one-fourth the diameter of the original.
Towards the upturned end of the specimen there are many strongly impressed conical pits, looking as if produced by prominent scale-like appendages, in the interspaces of which there are many minute impressions of the same form.
The character of the fossil is very uncertain ; it may be that of a batrachian or fish allied to Ceratodes.
The coal period is well characterized by abundance of remains of both kinds of animals.
Perhaps, however, the impression may be of vegetable origin.
Accompanying the fossil, there is another fragment of coal shale with vegetable remains, and apparently a lamellibranch shell.

121 Remarks on Elephant Remains.
Prof. Leidy called attention to the fragment of a fossil elephant molar tooth presented this evening by Messrs. W. W. Jefferis, and J.
B. Dillingham.
The specimen consisted of four dental plates, and is quite friable.
Adherent to it are a number of crystals of vivianite and also sonic of the same material in pulverulent form.
It was found resting on the Kaolin bed, about eight feet from the surface of the American Kaolin Works, near Chadd's Ford, Delaware Co., Pa. Prof. Leidy also exhibited drawings of an elephant tooth which had been submitted to his inspection by Dr. E. A.
Wood, of Pittsburg.
The specimen was dredged at the confluence of the Monongahela and Alleghany rivers.
The tooth, an upper molar, is well preserved and nearly entire.
Weight 9 lbs.
15^ ounces.
The triturating surface extends about half the fore and aft measurement of the tooth, and exhibits a dozen double dentinal bars.
Another drawing, submitted Lry Prof. E. 0.
Hovey, represents a hugh elephant tooth, from California, and now preserved in the cabinet of Wabash College, Indiana.
The specimen appears to be a last molar, and weighs 21^ lbs.
Towards its backpart the tooth is 13 inches long.
The triturating surface, 7-| inches long, presents eleven double dentinal plates.
All the specimens are supposed to belong to the extinct American Elephant, Elephas americanus.
Remarks on Stephanoceros C. Xewlin Peirce drawings of a specimen of an aquatic animal, belong genus Stephanoceros, which had been recently observed by him.
In doing so, he said he was induced to bring it before the Academy because it was, he believed, rarely met with in this country, and had not been previousl} 7 here described.
In its main characteristics, such as spiral carapace or case, five tentacle-like lobes armed with cilia, or, more properly, seta?, eye-spots, jaws, stomach, etc., it corresponds with the description given by Mr. C. Cubitt in his paper entitled "Observations on the Economy of Stephanoceros," in the " Monthly Microscopical Journal," vol.
iii., 1870, p. 242; but in addition to that very full sketch of this interesting object, there were some points of interest not there recorded.
First was the great length of seta?
or bristles projecting from the ends of the tentacles (only to be seen by especial care in focalizing with the lens), these overlapping each other formed a network in which were entrapped Paramecia of various sizes, as many as forty having been 9 ex ing hibited to the observed there at one time.
And by virtue of these long setae the animal's facility for procuring prey was greatly enhanced.
These minute objects which served as food were by a spasmodic effort of the bristles gradually brought within the arms, and from there, with this continued spasmodic movement which has been described by Mr. Cubitt, were brought within the vortex induced by an arrangement of cilia around the mouth, which, unlike the setae on the tentacles, were, while the animal was feeding, kept in a whorl.
The action of the setae on the lobes of the Stephanoceros is spasmodic; it creates no vortex, and it is only by actual contact with these setae that floating particles are whipped within the area inclosed by the lobes, where, by the same whipping action, they are twitched from point to point, irregularly downwards, until they come within the range of a vortex, which is due not to any action of the setae, but to a range of minute cilia in the funnel, distinct from the foraging appliances.
For two weeks the animal under observation fed voraciouslv.
The last few da^ys of this time granular layers were rapidly deposited on each side of the body just within the case, until the upper part of the carapace was distended with this accumulation.
For twenty-four hours following this condition but little or no food passed into the digestive cavity; any infusoria or other foreign substance accidentally coming within the tentacles being immediately expelled by a sudden constriction of these organs at their base.
It was evident from appearances that some change was about to take place.
The animal, at first very sensitive, withdrawing into its cell on the slightest jar of the table on which the instrument was placed, now but seldom contracted its retractile muscle even though the zoophyte-trough, in which it was examined, was quite violently tapped.
On the sixteenth day of observation it was unavoidably left for a few hours ; on returning to it the tentacles, with the above-described accumulated dark mass, were found to have left the original case and were attached to a portion of the plant beneath the branch to which it (the original case) adhered.
It now presented somewhat the appearance of an animal figured and described by Pritchard as a young Stephanoceros, a dark globular mass with five spreading or divergent tentacles, and at the distal extremity a very slight prolongation by which it was attached to a plant-stem by an almost invisible thread, devoid entirely of any cell or carapace.
Not long, however, was it destined to remain in this nude condition, for in twenty-four hours appearances of a cell were visible, and within three days it was domiciled in as beautiful a spiral case as the one it had left.
Its contractile muscle developing rapidly with the length of the cell, in a few days it presented to the observer all the peculiarities of the parent, and within two weeks was again ready for another change such as is above described, and which was accomplished with a similar result.
The Stephanoceros being too high in the scale of animal life to propagate by gemmation or division, tlie process above portrayed can have but a remote influence upon reproduction, as there was no multiplication by this change.
The original cell with its retracted body within, though remaining for weeks in an apparently perfect condition, was not seen to increase or in the least to change the growth-force seemingly being confined to the detached head and its accompanying organs.
Dr. Leid}^ stated that he had never seen specimens of Stephanoceros until they were shown to him by Mr. Peirce.
On the Disposition of the Great Omentum in Cynocephalus porcarius, etc.
Dr. H. C. Chapman made the following remarks : Man is usually regarded as being the only animal in which the peritoneum exhibits that arrangement in which the great omentum adheres to the colon.
I take the opportunity of calling the attention of the members to the fact that I found the great omentum more or less adherent to the colon in a Cynocephalus porcarius which recently died at the Zoological Garden as also in a Mecacus nemestrinus from the same institution.
In the embryonic condition of man the great omentum does not adhere to the colon, and this condition usually remains permanent in the other mammals.
In the cases just mentioned we have an interesting illustration of a transitional stage in the development of the peritoneum in man, permanently retained in monkeys.
On the Trias of York County, Pa. Prof. Frazer remarked that, as a matter of interest to students of the geology of the Trias, .
it may be stated that in the recent examination of these beds in York County the supposed constant N. W. dip was found to have very many exceptions.
A further fact was noted, viz., the deposition of these beds at their margin unconformably on the upturned edges of the lower silurian limestone.
Several indentations and bays of this limestone found on the Triassic border, exhibit its last dip away from the latter, which has the opposite dip.
The improbability of the formation of these Trias rocks by deposition along a sloping shore was mentioned.
Mr. Young stated that observations recently made by him in the vicinity of Norristown confirmed this state of facts.
Prof.
Cope wanted to know what had become of the other side of the basin, if the said theoi\y of the formation of Trias were true.
Prof. Frazer replied that the theory was not his theory, and itsdifficulties must be overcome by its adherents.

On a Curious Rhizopod.
Prof. Leidy remarked that in some water with aquatic plants, from Absecom Pond, N. J., preserved in an aquarium during the winter, he had detected a remarkable rhizopod, which he thought might best be compared to the reticular pseudopods of a Gromia separated from the body.
The creature moved actively and assumed the most varied forms.
At one time it appears as a C}dinder or a ball of jelly which may spread itself into a disk of extreme thinness, from the edge of which emanate a multitude of delicate pseudopods minutely ramifying, and with the contiguous branches anastomosing, as in the extension of the net of a Gromia.
At other times the creature divides up into branches from a trunk in the manner of a tree, but with the contiguous brandies anastomosing.
At times also the animal assumes the form of a cord, and the jelly accumulating along some portion of it will then move along the apparent cord like a drop of water running down a piece of twine.
The branching pseudopods extending into a net, the large angular meshes gradually contract by the widening of the cords, so that the meshes become perfectly circular and .appear like vacuoles imbedded in the jelly.
A circulation of jelly with granules is observed along all the pseudopoclal filaments exactly as in Gromia.
No trace of a nucleus or investing membrane in any position could be detected, but the protoplasmic structure contained a multitude of minute vacuoles.
Most of the specimens contained no food, and only one of the largest was observed to contain numerous minute Closteria.
The largest specimen, consisting of a net emanating from three divisions, occupied a semicircular space of of a mm.
by 2 mm.
Another specimen with a central disk \ mm.
by mm.
with its net, occupied a circular space mm.
in diameter.
A small cord-like specimen was \ mm.
long with an expanded end ^V mm.
wide ; and another irregular cord-like specimen was of a mm.
long with the widest portion ^ mm.
Amoeba porrecta, of Schultze, from the Adriatic Sea, most resembles the creature described.
While it is nearty related with Gromia, Lieberkuehnia, Vampyrella, Nuclearia, etc., it appears sufficiently distinct in its characters to represent another genus, and with the species may be appropriately named Biomyxa vagans.
On Psorospei'ins in a Mallard Duck.
Prof. Leidy remarked that Dr. Elliott Coues had recently submitted to his examination some portions of the flesh of a mallard duck preserved in glycerine.
The interstices of the muscles of the duck were stated, in the letter which accompanied the specimens, to be everywhere occupied by abundance of parasites.
Specimens of these, in the portions of flesh examined, proved to be oval white bodies from one to two lines long, and about one-third of a line thick.
Beneath the microscope they were found to contain myriads of fusiform corpuscles, resembling minute navicular, and measuring about the -^'^th of an inch in length.
Similar bodies were first discovered in many fishes by the late Prof. J. Midler, and described by him as parasites under the name of Psorosperms.
They have been repeatedly observed since by Retzius, Robin, and others, in the muscles and other parts of fishes, and they are usually regarded as vegetable parasites.
I have not previously heard of similar organisms having been detected in birds.
Though the mallard is not a fish eater, the bird may have become infected by having swallowed an infected fish.
On a Uouthless Fish.
Dr. George W. Lawrence, of Hot Springs, Arkansas, in the course of correspondence, had mentioned to Prof. Leidy the occurrence of a mouthless fish in the Ouachita River.
At his request Dr. Lawrence had sent him a specimen, which he now exhibited to the members.
The fish is the Buffalo sucker, Catastomus bubalus, Kirtland, living in the Mississippi and its tributaries.
The specimen is fifteen inches long, and appears to be in good condition.
The maxillaries, premaxillaries, and the mandible are absent, and the integument is tightly extended between the end of the snout, the suborbitals, and the articular ends of the quadrates.
In the centre of this expansion of the skin there is a small oval aperture one-fourth of an inch fore and aft, and one-eighth of an inch in transverse diameter.
The hole is sufficient to admit a current of water for the purposes of respiration; but it is difficult to understand how the fish had procured its food.
The cyprinoids, generally, are remarkable for their small toothless mouth, but it is, nevertheless, important in its prehensile capacity.
The condition of the specimen is, of course, a deformity, but appears to be the result of a want of development of the jaws, and not of accidental violence.
Dr. Lawrence observes that a few of such fishes are caught every year in the Ouachita, sometimes with the oral orifice so small as barely to admit a crow-quill, and occasionally without even the vestige of an orifice.
If the last condition really occurs, the fish can only supply itself with food and with water for respiration through the branchial fissures, by the alternating outward and inward movements of the opercula.
On Ouramceba.
Prof. Leidy remarked that his description of the curious rhizopod, he had named Ouramoeba, in the Proceedings of Ma}" 12, 1874, having been noticed by Mr. Archer, of Dublin, this gentleman had directed his attention to notices of the same animal described in the Proceedings of the Dublin Microscopical Club for Feb. 186fi and Oct. 1873.
In these notices Mr. Archer regards the animal only as an Amoeba villosa in another condition from that ordinarily observed.
Mr. Archer's description clearly refers to the same animal as that named Ouramceba, in which he aptly compares the bunch of tail-like appendages to "a bundle of dipt-candlcs," and it is of some interest to know that the singular creature, like so many other rhizopods, is common to Europe and America.
While Mr. Archer regards the "Amoeba with remarkable posterior linear processes" (Proc.
Dublin Micr.
Club, Oct. 1873,314) as exhibiting another condition of existence of an Amoeba from the one usually observed in the genus, he gives no evidence that such is the fact.
Until this is proved to be the case the peculiar character of the animal justifies its separation as representing a distinct genus with the name of Ouramoeba.
Since the latter was first noticed, many additional specimens have been observed, and though, as in the case of rhizopods generally, they exhibit considerable variation, it appears that several species may be distinguished.
The genus may be thus characterized : Ouramceba.
Body, as in Amoeba, consisting of an everchanging fluctuating mass of jelly, composed of a granular entosarc, including a contractile vesicle and a discoid nucleus, and defined by a clearer ectosarc.
Pseudopods usually digitiform, projecting anywhere but usually in a direction differentiated as forward, and composed of extensions of the ectosarc closely accompanied by included extensions of the entosarc.
Posterior part of the bod3" furnished with one or more tufts of non-retractile, rigid, linear 127 appendages, branching radically from common points in the vicinity of the contractile vesicle.
Ouramozba vorax.
Fig.
A.
Body active, usually ramifying forward from a median stock extending from the posterior blunt extremity.
Posterior appendages numerous, originating in several tufts up to five or six, from one-third to nearly the length of the body, linear, straight or curved, uniformly cylindrical, or here and there contracted, commencing in a pointed manner from a common root, and terminating obtusely.
Length of body, from I to ^ of a mm.
; length of appendages from one-third to nearly that of the body.
The creature consumes multitudes of diatomes, desmids, and filamentous alga?.
Found in springs and ponds, near Darby Creek, Delaware County, Pennsylvania.
Further observations have induced me to believe that the animal named 0. lapaa is the same as the preceding.
A variety has been observed in several instances in which the animal had a single pair of appendages springing from a common root.
Ouramo3ba botulicauda.
Fig.
B.
This species is predicated on the form alluded to in my previous communication as having, a single tuft of three moniliform rays.
I have seen it a number of times since, and its characters appear to be sufficiently constant to recognize it as a distinct species.
It is much smaller than the preceding.
The body measures about the T ^ of a millimetre.
The appendages are usually in a tuft of three; each appendage consisting of from one to three sausage-like joints.
Found with the preceding.
The Occurrence of Celestine in Blair County, Pennsylvania.
Mr. Chas.
A.
Young stated that Dana gives, as the original locality of celestine, Frankstown, Huntington Co., Pa.
The locality is at Bells' Mills, Blair County.
The mineral is found at the foot of the western slope of Brush Mountain, on the west branch of the Little Juniata, one mile south of railroad station.
The celestine occurs in beds of irregular thickness, in a hard gray limestone slate.
The beds of the mineral are sometimes almost an inch in thickness, thinning out in the space of a lew feet to a thickness scarcely more than that of a piece of paper.
The beds of the mineraf sometimes split, having for a parting a soft brown shale, which material also directly underlies and overlies the mineral to a depth of somewhat less than an inch.
The celestine is of the fibrous variety, the fibres being perpendicular to planes of bedding.
It is rather pale, the greater part of it having a very faint blue tint.
April 27.
The President, Dr. Ruschenberger, in the chair.
Twenty-four members present.
The By-Laws of the Academj^ -were amended, as follows: Art.
2, Chap.
2, in place of " Minors shall not be eligible as members or correspondents," the following words are substituted : " Pei'sons not under sixteen years of age may be elected members, provided their nominations be first approved by the Council.
Members under the legal age of twenty-one are not entitled to vote at any meeting of the Academy, nor to serve on committees."
On the Structure of the York County Valley Limestone , and on Micro-photography of Minerals.
Prof. Frazer asked the permission of the Academy to put on record two observations made since the last meeting.
The first concerned the structure of the York County limestone valley.
H. D. Rogers (whose work was so accurate and full of thought that corrections can only be hazarded after careful consideration), in his report of a section down the Susquehanna from Wrightsville to Havre de Grace, speaks of two folded anticlinals which separate the main synclinal basin of amoral limestone from the smaller one, which crosses the river from Lancaster County near Cabin Branch Run.
The dips as observed and recorded by my party last season fully justify this interpretation, and were it not for other facts not known at the time the above section was made, no one could hesitate to accept this explanation.
But on comparing seven sections made across the lower Silurian measures from Littlestown to Wrightsville, it was found that in every case but the latter, there seemed to be abundant evidence of a vault along which the southeastern half of the valley had been torn away by an upthrow, and the remaining limestone abutted on the lower side of the older slates.
It was found that the supposed double anticlinal wave structure depended on a single dip, which it only needs to suppose were local in character to bring this section into conformity with the rest.
The symmetrical character of the valley also was based upon a single dip in this latter case, not at all inconsistent with a view which would harmonize all the sections.
The other point which Prof. Frazer desired to record was in connection with the reproduction of the structure of the trap rocks as exhibited in thin slices.
Among the causes which had hindered the application of micro-photography to this purpose was the fact that the constituent minerals which were colored yellow or red became black in the photograph.
The experiment of photographing the slides in polarized light and in different positions of the analyzer has met with very fair success.
The photographs of the enlargements of 34 and 13G diameters, respectively, had been exhibited in connection with a paper read before the last meeting of the American Philosophical Society, but at that time the expedient of overcoming the anactinism of parts of the image was merely suggested.
Since then six photographs of the same part of the same thin section of the dolerite, best known, have been made.
In five of these photographs all the conditions remained the same except the position of the analyzei", which was rotated to five points corresponding to maxima and minima of some of the more prominent objects in the field.
A particular crystal of pyroxene being selected, it was pointed out that in three of the photographs this was light colored with a dark axis, and in two dark with a light axis.
Thus in a series of photographic prints made in this wa} r the minerals which were dark from the anactinism of their transmitted light were easily distinguished from those that were dark from opacity, as for example magnetite.
As a means of still further modifying the conditions, No.
6 was photographed just like No.
4, except that a selenite plate was introduced over the slide and between the prisms.
Prof. Frazer concluded b}' remarking that he had delayed returning the thin slides of Connecticut traps prepared and kindly loaned to him by Mr. E. S. Dana, of New Haven, for exhibition before the Philosophical Society, until he had repeated the experiments before the Academy.
He informally invited those members to remain after the present meeting who desired to see the slides in polarized light.
The Connecticut and Pennsylvania traps were then projected on the screen and their effect on polarized light illustrated.
Ellicott Fisher and J. S. Alexander were elected members, and Col. T. M. Bryan, of Vincenttown, N. J., was elected a correspondent.
The committees to which they had been referred recommended the following papers to be published :
