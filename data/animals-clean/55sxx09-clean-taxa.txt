 Length 8 mm. black and yellow head and thorax thickly clothed with long erect coarse hair yellowishwhite below brown above  scape also hairy.
Tegulse yellow nervures and stigma ferruginous basal nervure a little basad of transversomedial metathorax and scutellums entirely black basal area of metathorax with minute longitudinal ridges  tibiae yellow each with a black spot behind femora with a black stripe behind.
In all respects very closely related to N. civilis from Cresson's description of which it differs thus  Supraclypeal mark well developed flagellum mostly black above anterior margin of yellow band on first segment straight.
These characters are not very important ones but I have N. civilis from Colorado and am confident that the Californian species is distinct though it may prove that it should rank only as a subspecies.
The dark hair on the thorax of subsimilis is a good distinguishing character.

The S3ecies of this group Xanthidium and part of Holonomada of Robertson are very variable and in my preliminary examination of them I separated out several supposed species which I have now concluded to treat as varieties only.
Nomada dontariae Rob..
I have a male from southern Illinois sent to me several years ago as A.
luteola by Mr. Robertson.
As it clearly possesses the characters assigned to dentarios.
by Robertson I assume it to be that insect.
Nomada vincta Say.
I have before me three specimens all from Illinois belonging to the Acad.
Nat.

The male is marked by Mr. Viereck mixed with affabilis flagellum thicker than in affabilis.
One of the females has the mesothorax red with a very broad black stripe in the middle the other has it black with a red stripe on each side above the tegua3.
The former specimen is marked by Mr. Viereck mixed with luteola.
Robertson says that N. vincta is autumnal  Mr. Fowler's California 'vincta flying in May is presumably another species.
Nomada zebrata Cress.
The female varies a good deal in size and looks much like N. morrisoni.
I have before me the following specimens Beulah N. M. 8000 feet August 1902 Id South Fork Eagle Creek White .Alts. N. M. about 8000 feet August 16 1 9  collected by C. H. T. Townsend  Colorado Springs Colo. L. Bruner No.

Nomada sulphurata Smith.
This has been regarded as a synonym of A.
lulcola lut it appears to me to be a perfectly valid species.
I thought at first that N .
luteoloides Rob. might be a synonym of it but the males at least certainly appear to be different.
Compared with N. hiteoloides the male of A'.
sulphurata has a larger thorax and broader abdomen  the jleiu'a shows a large irregular yellow mark and a yellow spot beneath the wings the scutellum is all yellow the lateral margins of the mesothorax are yellow and the metathorax has yellow lateral marks.
The scape is more swollen there is a yellow spot in front of anterior ocellus and the A'hole of the face below the level of antennje is yellow.
The hind margins of the ventral surface of abdomen are broadly pale ferruginous.
The flagellum is denticulate or warted beneath on the fifth to seventh segments from the end.
The female has the mesothorax black usually but not alwas with reddishyellow stripes.
The material of A.
sulphurata before me consisting of Id  5 9 was collected by Mr. Viereck at Edge Hill Pa. the male May 23 the females April 28 and May 5 1901.
Nomada rivalis Cress.

Sci.

A female also marked ''W.
T. looks as if it belonged with the male but the basal nervure meets the transverse medial and the specimen is referred to A.
citrina.
Nomada civilis Cress.
A male from the National iMuseum is labelled Colo. 1871 and is apparently from the Baker collection.
I thought this might prove to be the male of N .
morrisoni but a couple of females from Corvallis Ore. June 3 1899 are so much like the male that I can onlrefer them to the same species.
The characters given in the table separate them from morrisoni.
Nomada luteoloides Rob. and N. luteola Lap.
A female from Georgia sent to me by Mr. Fox as A.
luteola has the yellow of metathorax encroaching upon the enclosure as Robertson states for luteola but the proportions of the antennal joints agree with luteoloides.
A male from Georgia received with the female has the flagellum slightly denticulate beneath and the orbits yellow except at summit behind so it ought to be luteoloides.
Nevertheless the denticulation is feeble and the anterior tibiie have a black mark behind the metathorax has four dull yellow spots.
The band on first abdominal segment is ferruginous in the middle.
This does not precisely agree with either of the forms Mr. Robertson gets in Illinois it seems to fall between them.
It does not agree with N. sulphurata although that was described from Georgia.
N. luteola was originally described from Carolina and I suspect that the Georgia specimens here described may truly represent that species the Illinois insect of Robertson being different but this is at present little better than a guess.
A female collected bMr. Viereck at Clementon N. J. May 22 1898 is genuine N. luteola as understood by Robertson A couple of males from Mr. Viereck one marked Montgomery county.
Pa. are referred to N. luteola.

Nomada xanthopMla Ckll. var.
pecosensis n. var.
n.
sp..
A female specimen was taken at the Kin Kale Ranch Pecos N. M. June 26 1903 by Wilmatte P. Cockerell.
It has a good deal of resemblance in color and markings to A'' suavis Cress. but it is by no means the same.
I refer it to xanthophila because it looks like that species and is from the same general region but it differs from the type c
by the microscopically tessellate rather than punctured abdomen the bright ferruginous stigma the second submarginal cell conspicuously narrowed above first joint of labial palpi considerably longer than the other three together second considerably longer than the third and fourth together third antennal joint conspicuously longer than fourth.
Jther characters more likely to be merely sexual are Head rather abundantly hairy though the face is almost bare supracl3q3eal mark welldeveloped scape yellow in front otherwise ferruginous with a black mark behind antennae reaching scutellum sides of metathorax with very large yellow patches pleura with a very large transverse yellow patch and a yellow spot beneath the wings no ferruginous at all hind coxae yellow in front base and apical margin of first abdominal segment black the rest a very broad band yellow no ferruginous on second segment.
The eyes are sagegreen.
From A superba this differs by being smaller the basal nervure very little basad of the transverse medial scutellum much less bilobate mesothorax with only very short inconspicuous hair outer side of third submarginal cell curved instead of angled labial palpi pale ferruginous darker first joint almost llack in superba etc.
The A'.
superha compared is from S. Illinois Robertsoi .
The humplike process seen on the sides of the metathorax in superba is barely indicated bj' a slight angularity in the Pecos insect.
The length of the latter is about IH mm. and it is not so broad as superba.
In Robertson's table of Holonomada the Pecos insect runs to affabUis and vincta having the mesonotum coarsely punctured nearly bare flagcllum red its apical portion more or less suffused with blackish.
On the whole I expect the Pecos bee to prove distinct from N. xanthophila but as the two are so very much alike and are known onhby single examples of opposite sexes I leave the female as a variety' pecosensis.

One is from Washington State without further data the others are from Grangeville Ida. deposited by Wm.

The Washington specimen is no doubt genuine citrina.
The Idaho form has the face slightly narrower and in one of them the head and thorax are red with yellow markings the black being reduced to a few spots and patches.
In this state the insect looks much like A.
morrisoni or zebrata.
In the Washington specimen the basal nervure meets the transverse medial in the Idaho ones the lasal is a trifle more basad.
In Cresson's types as I learn from Mr. Viereck the basal nervure is from moderately to consideraly basad of the transverse medial.
The red form from Idaho may be called A'' citrina var.
rufida.
It has the antennae entirely red except that the scape is yellow in front the front and vertex are bright red except that the ocelli are on a black patch mesothorax red coarsely punctured a little yellow in front of the tegulae scutellum with two large yellow spots separated by red abdomen yellow with red bands basal half of first segment red with four black or blackish spots legs red and yellow hind coxse and femora heavily marked behind with black.

It is possibly a distinct species.
It is from Colorado Morrison in U. S. National Museum.

The specimen of magnifica has the yellow parts wholly reddened by cyanide but it seems to have been marked as in grandis the abdomen was certainly yellow with the hind margins of the segments infuscated and with the basal half of the first segment ferruginous with a dusky spot on each side.
Other particulars are Apical part of mandibles black mandibles simple stout head practically wdthout black area about ocelli blackish antennae entirel' red third joint longer than fourth mesothorax coarsely and extremely ' Mr. J. C. Crawford writes that he has the 2  and that it has a red abdomen.

Nomada americana Kirby.
This species seems to have a very wide distribution specimens in the National Museum are from Canada Colorado with numbers 2076 2185 and Louisiana with numbers 2564 2567 2420.
They appear to come from the Baker collection.
Two in Coll.
of Acad Nat.
Sci.
Phila. are from North Carolina.
I also have the species from So.
Illinois Robertson and Baldwin Kans. June Bridwell.
It appears from the Bakerian nvunbers that this species is taken in Colorado along with N. scita.
Now scita has a spine on the anterior coxa and is very near to americana though undoubtedly distinct.
I cannot help thinking it possible that the Colorado americana females though to all appearances genuine americana are actually females of scita. The male of N. americana is quite variable if I had only a large Canadian specimen and one of the smallest from liouisiana I should think them different species.
The Louisiana males 21 examined vary greatly in size.
One male is from Indiana with number 2003.
Nomada martinella sp.

Hob.
 Mesilla Park N. M. April 9 at flowers of plum Cockerell 2.628.
Named after my little son.
Two specimens were taken.
A supposed variety of the same species somewhat larger length about 8 mm.
 with the second submarginal cell very much broader and the tegulse lighter and yellower and less punctured was sent to me by Mr. Fox as N.incerta.
It is from Colorado and if its distinctive characters are constant it is presumably separable specifically.
Possibly it is the true female of A'' scita.
A specimen from Sioux City Neb.
Bruner 29 is also referred to A.
martinella it has the second submarginal cell However I find two males of N. americana dacotana labelled  Colo.
2076.
comparatively narrow as in nmrtinella  but it receives the recurrent nervure far beyond its middle at its middle in viartinella type  in size it nearly agrees with martinella the first joint of the flagellum is not much shorter than the second seen from the front whereas in 7nartindla type it is considerably shorter.
All these insects are very easily separated from A'' americana by the clear red antennae and thorax without a black stripe.
At a glance they look like N. ultima taraxacella but they are Centrias with strongly punctured abdomen and spines on front coxse.
They have not the black diamond on the metathorax which is seen in taraxacella.

Sometimes the clypeus has only the anterior margin yellow and sometimes the first abdominal segment has an interrupted band while that on the second is narrowly continuous in the middle.
Five specimens examined.
N. scitiformis and also N. scita belong to Centrias having a spine on the anterior coxa.
The anterior legs of the males of these and N. americana differ thus N. scitiformis Spine black fairly long red of leg fairly bright.
N. scita Spine pale red slender and rather long directed caudad red of leg bright.

N. articulata Smith cJ from Brookings S.
Dak. June S 1891 has a long spine on the anterior coxa and belongs to Centrias.
The hind femora are arcuate and the groundcolor of the abdomen is mainly red.
This specimen of A.
articulata was identified by Mr. Fox who gave it to me but I find that it is not typical and in fact Smith's description of articulata applies to the ordinary male of americana .
Kirby as understood by Robertson.
Hence if any one should wish to discard Kirby's name as of uncertain application articulata w411 be the proper name of the insect.
I do not believe that valida Smith which has priority of place is applicable.

It is separable from cuneata by the bands of the abdomen being creamywhite instead of yellow but it is extremely closely allied.
When the abdomen is retracted the bands on the third and following segments become partly or wholly hidden.
The length of the insect is 6 to 7 mm.

In one female the abdomen is without yellow spots in another there is only one black band on the mesothorax.

Nomada valida Smith.
2 .Length 8 to 9 mm.
 mandibles simple abdomen dark chestnutred lasal half of first segment black right across second submarginal cell broad above basal nervure a very little basad of transversomcdial or sometimes a fair distance basad.
I find the markings just as described by Smith except that only the very narrow hind margin of the chpeus is black.
I recognize A valida in three females from the Baker collection in the National Iuseum.
Tao are lalelled ''Canada 1872 and the other New York 1868.
The scutellum is convex bristly but verslightly bilobed.
The fourth antennal joint is a little longer than the third.
The insect is evidently close to 'N.
simplex Rob. but it lacks the spots on the abdomen.
N. valida is separated from A corvallisensis by its larger size distinct parapsidal grooves and dark bristles on scape from N. clarkii ly its much darker coloration and smaller wings.
It is however a close ally of A'' clarkii and when specimens have been collected right across the northern part of the continent it may be necessary to reduce clarkii to subspecific rank.
A male marked ''Canada 1872 may belong to valida.
It is 9 mm.
long face silveryhairy clyieus supraclypeal mark and rapidly narrowing lateral marks yellow scape rather stout jellow tinged with red flagellum entirely red  thorax very dark but the bifid red marks on mesothorax are faintly indicated very narrow hind margin of prothorax yellowish scutellum and postscutellum mainly red pleura with an obscure dull yellow spot and a smaller and more obscure red one higher up metathorax all black with coarse vermiform rugse at base scutellum more prominent than in   and with white instead of fuscous hairs tegulse pale yellowishtestaceous deep red in 9  third submarginal cell as broad above as second narrower in 9   basal nervure a fair distance basad of transversomedial  abdomen ferruginous basal half of first segment black first segment with a rather narrow interrupted 'ellow band second with a very lroad yellow band having only a linear median interru3tion  remaining segments with yellow bands more or less notched behind laterally apical plate deeply notched venter dark ferruginous with a large yellow spot at apex.
The labrum is yellow with a minute red denticle in the middle.
The legs are red the hind femora black beneath.
The dentate labrum of this male allies it Avith A armcda H.S. which European species is said to occur like valida in Nova Scotia.
The large size of this male Canada 1872 and the characters of the Avings tegulae metathorax etc. make its identity with valida so questionable that I believe lea.st confusion will occur if it goes for the present under another name.
It may be called A.

Another species with a denticle on the labrum is N. depressa Cresson if I have correctly identified as such a specimen collected by Mr. Viereck at Lehigh Gap Pa. June 30 1897.
It is a female and has the large semilunar depression on the fifth abdominal segment as described in depressa.
It is about 9 mm.
long.
The second transversocubital nervure is incomplete in both wings.
An allied species described below occurs in Oregon.
Two males collected bj Ir.
iereck at Philadelphia Pa. May 2 1897 have the mesothorax marked wdth dark red just as in N. armatella and also possess a very rudimentary spine on the labrum only visible because of its reddish color.
I was almost ready to think these a varietal form of armatella until I oserved that they had bidentate mandibles and belonged to Gnathias.
As a matter of fact they are a varietal form of N. hella parallel to the variety of A'.
perplexa cited in the table of Gnathias.
Typical hella also has a minute spine on the labrum or rather a rudiment of a spine.
Nomada volatilis Smith described from Canada is I believe a form of N. hella.
We are not informed whether it has bidentate mandibles o and I thought at first it might be N. nrmatella but the following characters indicate hella rather than armatella Supraclypeal mark absent  antennae fulvous beneath nothing said about yellow on scape  tegulte ferruginous abdominal bands interrupted apical margins of ventral abdominal segments fuscoferruginous.

615 VARIATION IN THE SNAILGENUS ASHMUNELLA.
BY T. D. A. COCKERELL.
Dr. Pilsbry's interesting remarks in these Proceedings 1903 pp.
193200 prompt me to offer some observations on Ashmunella.
The species A. ihomsoniana with its various races or subspecies inhabits the mountains near Santa Fe and Las Vegas N. M. and has lately been obtained in sufficient quantities to afford statistical data which may be expressed in curves or polygons.
On June 20 1903 Dr. I.
Grabham and the present writer collected a large nimiber of A. thomsoniana cooperce on the Kin Kale Ranch Pecos N. M. alt.
about 6700 feet and on plotting out the curves of shelldiameter it was found that the mode for cooperce fell exactly between thomsoniana proper and porterce though there was a tendency toward a secondary mode coincident with the normal mode of porterce.
The following table makes the facts clear and can be converted into a series of curves by an one who cares to do so  Ashmunella thomsoniana Varieties.

CO a 0 3 o V c 2 s 9 49 50 1 1 The lanzaiiares Creek portercc represent a siibvariety having the basal tooth with the outer denticle large and pointed and the inner one quite rudimentary a mere slight swelling umbilicus large broadly exposing penultimate whorl  parietal tooth strong.
On the other hand the Cooper's Mill thomsoniana have the basal tooth bifid as in porterce though they have the small size of typical thomsoniana.
Whether they should be regarded as another distinct subvariety is uncertain as' so few specimens of the Santa Fe Canon thomsoniana have been collected.
It is to be remarked that size is not connected closely with altitude regarding the whole series together.
The large porterce occupies the highest altitudes in the moimtains near Las Vegas.
A single example from the debris of the Pecos river had no lasal or outer denticle and could easily have been mistaken for A. ashmuni Dall.
Dr. Grabham and I dissected a number of the Pecos cooperw and found the epiphallus with a basal curve and double insertion of penisretractor spermatheca without any bulbous swelling at end very variable in length that of seven specimens measuring respectively in mm. 29 35 22 33.5 35 45 31.

 Those marked with an asterisk occurred only in some darkcolored beds which seem to be more recent than the red beds containing A. pecosensis.
High up on the bluff Dr. Grabham found an apparently fossil shell oi A. t. cooperce more strongly ribbed than the normal form and thus tending toward pecosensis.
EXPEKIMENTS WITH ANTS INDUCED TO SWIM.
BY ADELE M. FIELDE.
The behavior of ants often appears to originate in mental processes and the myrmecologist is erpetually lured to further experiment by a tantalizing expectation of ascertaining whether the cause of their action be psychic.
One afternoon in the summer of 1901 I inadvertently left upon the base of a Lubbock nest in the laboratory a score or two of ants Stenamma fulvum with a few of their larvae and a little damp earth.
Before the next noonday they had built with particles of the earth what looked like a roundish hut not more than two centimeters long with a doorway and a smokehole.
Its outside shape was like that of the interior of one of their recesses in their wild nests.
They had carried their larvae into it and had thereby screened them from light and from the wind.
The air of the room was dry and after a few hours the edifice disintegrated from the evaporation of its moisture.
These ants live under loose stones and among the roots of grasses an do not build habitations on a surface.
In opening scores of their nests I have never found any similar structure.
The little hut seemed to be evidence of a purposeful adjustment to new conditions. '
In August 1903 I left upon the bottom of a dish surrounded b water in a larger dish about seventy Lasius latipes workers with fifty of their tiny cocoons in two centimeters of earth covered by a pane of orange glass ten centimeters long and eight centimeters broad.
Such glass excludes partial
 but not wholly the ultraviolet lightrays always avoided by the ants.
The earth extended about four centimeters beyond the glass.
There was a morsel of food on the glass.
The ants had been undisturbed and unobserved for ten days when I saw that they had nearly covered their roofglass to the depth of about two millimeters with particles of earth.
Iany of the particles were half as long as the longest of the ants and certainly heavier than any one of them and could not have been laid on the glass without considerable effort on the part of the ants.
This overlaying of the glass secured darkness for the workers and the young under the glass and numerous runs with exits outside the edge of the glass had been made in the earth below as is done in their wild nests under stones.
Thinking that the presence of the food on the glass might have influenced the deposit of the particles of earth I removed the food to the end of the dish washed the glass clean and replaced it.
In a few days the ants had again covered the glass with like particles of earth.
The work was always carried on in the night and I did not witness its performance.
I made a similar arrangement of dishes earth and glass for Stenamma fulvum but these ants did not overlay their semitransparent roof.
On August 29 1903 I placed about fifty workers and three queens of this same species with a halfteaspoonful of their pupae upon the base of the same Lubbock nest in the same place in the same room hoping that they would again build a hut for their young during the ensuing night.
I had many tens of times put Stenamma fulvum on this board with their nestearth and young and they had never once escaped by swimming.
The board is square thirtyeight centimetei's broad and four centimeters high.
On its upper surface about a centimeter from its edge there is a channel having a flat bottom and vertical sides two centimeters deep and from twentysix to thirty millimeters wide.
When this channel is filled with water an island about thirty centimeters square is formed by the central portion of the board.
The ants were on this island and their kind had never manifested alility to swim across the surrounding channel.
These individual ants were habitants of a nest located at a considerable distance from any body of water and they could have had no previous experience in swimming.
I was therefore astonished on the following morning in finding that the ants instead of building huts for their young were carrying it to a crevice forty centimeters from the island between the supporting table and the wall of the room.
Two of the queens had gone and one queen remained with a group of newly hatched callows.
The labor of transporting the callows continued all day.
I was curious to see how the queen would reach the crevice as no ant travels far on any path befpre untraversed by her.
As soon as the queen crossed the channel there was increased excitement among the ants.
Several of the larger ones approached the queen and one of them lifted her free from the edgeway and carried her to the crevice.
All the remaining callows and the pupse were likewise carried to the crevice and at nightfall not an ant remained on the island nor had any dead ants nor deserted pupte been left in the channel.
The exodus had occupied thirty hours.
When crossing the channel without a burden the smallest ants walked on the surface of the water.
Heavier ones clawed the surface with the fore feet walked with the middle pair and trailed the hinder ones.
The degree of submergence greatly varied.
When carrying a burden the ant swam with the legs wholly submerged only the tarsi of the hinder ones being above the surface.
The antennae waved constantly and progress was very slow.
Ants without burdens were from ten to sixty seconds in crossing the channel while burdened ones  These experiments were all made in the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole Mass.
were from one to three minutes in struggling across.
Sometimes the burdened swimmer became completely submerged and when this happened she abandoned the burden which floated while the ant scrambled ashore.
It was evident that the strength of the burdened ants was exhausted in reaching the edge way though they crossed in a straight line at right angles to the length of the channel.
They had chosen as the main crossingplace the narrowest part of the channel which was on the side of the board opposite the source of light a northern window.
The next morning I thoroughly cleansed all parts of the board turned the narrowest part of the channel to the opposite side the northern  replaced it on the table  filled the channel with clean water  enclosed the board and an area half its size by a wall of plaster of Paris. and set within the area one of my artificial nests having an entrance four millimeters wide at a distance of fifteen centimeters from the boal'd.
On the island I then put some antfood three hundred workers twelve queens of whom five had long been deprived of antennae and a large teaspoonful of eggs larve and pupse.
These ants were from the same colony as those that had gone to the crevice.
The only ants in the arena were those on the island.
My preparations were completed at eleven o'clock and the first ant a small adult worker crossed the channel at a quarter before twelve o'clock.
The second ant crossed in another place fifteen minutes later and a third crossed after another half hour.
At three o'clock four more workers and three queens had crossed.
The workers appeared to be seeking a habitation and the queens were roaming on the edgeway.
The first ant to enter the nest was a worker that chanced to find the small entrance at five o'clock when many ants were prospecting in the area.
Before the discovery of the dark warm humid interior of the new nest and up to seven o'clock no ant had returned across the channel.
The ensuing morning at six o'clock the ants were transporting 3oung across the channel mainly at its narrowest part on the north side and toward the light.
The eggs larvae and pupte were piled on the south side of the island farthest from the light and many ants were covering the pile with their bodies.
Rescuers ran along the edgeway or held to it with their hinder feet and stretched themselves over the water as if with the purpose of securing flotsam.
If they rendered aid to struggling swimmers other than the queens it was merely by ' For el's method of preventing the escape of ants.
assuring them in a touch of the antenna
that they were nearing a foothold.
Again all the swimmers with or without a burden crossed the channel at right angles to its length.
The swimming ants varied in length from five to seven millimeters but the longest ones rarely repassed the channel and the transits were made chiefly by ants from five to six millimeters long.
They therefore had to swim at least twice their length after relincjuishing one shore before they touched the other.
They always lingered long on the brink running to and fro entered the water with much hesitation and relinquished the shore with delay.
I supplied as much water as was lost by evaporation and kept the surface of the channel nearly level with that of the island and the edgeway.
The concavity of the meniscus was slight but capillarity always hindered the ant in her departure at one shore and somewhat accelerated her arrival at the other shore.
My first experiments were made with a view to ascertaining whether the ants laid each an individual track across the water as is always done in traversing a solid.
Test a.
 I selected ants that must have crossed the water at least once because they were returning to the island and when they had released their hinder feet from the edgeway I took with a pipette having a curved point some drops of water from the surface of the water directly in front of the swimmer.
f thirtyone ants twentyone went immediately on their way to the island and ten turned back to the edgeway.
The taking of the water may not have caused all of the ten to turn back since many other ants finding the struggle of crossing too great turned back when the water was untouched.
Had the ants that continued on their way had a track previously laid on the water it would probably have been destroyed by my action and the twent3one ants would also have turned back.
Test h.  Choosing an ant that was returning to the island while she was in midchannel I passed a knifeblade five millimeters broad several times around the ant penetrating the water to half its depth.
Often ants thus encircled none turned back.
Test c.  I swept the floor of the room violently raised much dust and left the channel imtouched during the ensuing twentyfour hours.
I then counted the ants that crossed the channel during a halfhour and found that twentyone passages were made to the island and twentyfive away from the island.
The latter number included four ants with burdens.
With a shred of cloth I then brushed the dust from the whole surface of the channel being careful not to touch its shores.
I then counted all the ants that crossed during the ensuing halfhour.
Twenty passages were made to the island and twentytwo were made from the island.
The latter number included two lurdenbearers.
The close correspondence of nimibers is explained by the fact that a few individuals among the ants do most of the work undertaken.
After the removal of the dust with displacement of the particles of water over the whole surface of the channel there was among the ants no action indicating either a difficulty in pursuing their routes or a necessity for laying new tracks across the channel.
Test d.  I next considered only ants that had taken up a burden to carry away from the island and when I saw one of these about to enter the water I swept its surface with a little cloth broom that extended nearly across the channel.
Fifteen burdenbearing ants crossed over water whose particles had just been disturbed to a depth of several millimeters.
Their course was as direct and their time of crossing was as brief as that of lurdenbearers whose path had not been thus swept.
These tests show that the ants did not depend on a previousl laid track when they crossed the water.
They evidently expected to find the water in the place where they had previously encountered it.
Each ant pursued her laid track on the wood to the edge of the channel and then orienting herself by something other than her track she crossed and picked up her track on the opposite shore.
Bethe's wellknown hypothesis that the ants orient themselves through a polarization of the scent laid down by their feet is surely inapplicable when the ants have no track and keep to their bearings without one.
 The difficulty of crossing the channel was greatly increased when the ant was forced to turn herself in the water in order to pursue her route but even under this arduous strain most of the ants maintained their course.
Test e.  With a small knifeblade I swirled the water when the ant was in midchannel so as to turn the swimmer once or more around leaving her with her head toward the shore from which she had just come.
The results were as follows 1.
Of nineteen ants without burden on their way from the edgeway to the island fifteen turned themselves in the water and swam to the island.
Four failed in the effort to turn and went back to the edge way.
2.
Of twentytwo ants without burden on their wav from the island to the edgeway seventeen turned themselves in the water and went to the edgeway.
Five failed in the effort to turn and went back to the island.
3.
Of five ants with burdens on their way from the island to the edgeway four turned themselves in the water and swam to the edgeway.
One after a long struggle landed on the island.
4.
A burdenbearer on her way from the island to the edgeway.
was gently turned around by me when she was in midchannel and caused to land upon the island at her startingpoint.
She was manifestly bewildered.
Holding on to her charge she wandered about over the island for twenty minutes then returned to the place of her landing laid down her burden swam across the channel to the edgeway and back again picked up her burden crossed the channel again and went to the nest.
Dead ants or flecks of wood or yarn of the same size as an ant when cast upon the water and turned by its swirling in the same way as that in which I turned the ants did not revert to their former positions The volition of the ant not the force of the water was the cause of the semirevolution made by the ant in turning back upon her course.
She can orient herself upon trackless water as well as upon a tracked solid but in either case her environment must have been previouslv explored.
I then undertook tests showing whether the ant could orient herself when removed from the shortest line between the end of her path on the one shore and its beginning on the other shore.
Test .When the ant was on her way to the island and in midchannel I placed the nozzle of a bulbsyringe at a distance from the swimmer and very gently drew the water and the ant several centimeters out of her line of crossing and in the direction of the length of the channel without changing the direction of the ant's bod.
Of twentyeight ants thus drawn away from their position all gave marked signs of bewilderment.
Some ceased for a long time from swimming some made a complete re'olution sidcwise some plunged deeper some swam up and down the channel.'
That they had lost their bearings was as evident as if thev had been upon a solid although their movements were more limited in range.
Twelve of these ants finally landed on the island and fourte'en landed on the edgeway.
Of five other ants crossing with burdens from the island to the edgeway all were similarly bewildered by being drawn away from position and were many minutes in reaching shore.
Three of them landed on the island and two of them landed on the edgeway.
Dead ants or flecks of wood or yarn subjected to the same conditions did not behave as did the ants and made no similar movements.
Test g.  When an ant was returning to the island and was in midchannel I pushed the water wdth the cloth broom so that the swimmer would be borne on the water to a distance of a centimeter or two off the line by which she would have crossed if the water had remained untouched but keeping the axis of the ant's body parallel to that line.
Of nine ants thus moved five went on to the island and four turned back to the edgeway.
The evidences of bewilderment were much less marked than when the ants were drawn to a distance of several centimeters from their position.
It is plain that the ants did not orient themselves from their own track where no track existed.
Far less of manipulation than was spent upon the water will destroy the track of these ants upon a solid.
They must have traversed the distance across the channel depending for their orientation on something other than their immediate footprints.
Their lesser bewilderment when they were moved a lesser distance from their position indicates that theorient themselves by something that is not far removed from them.
This may be the remembered odor of objects at very short distances one from another recognized for guidance from point to point as is supposed by Forel.
The ants gave no indication that they had an intellectual conception of the island on which they spent many daj's nor of its surrounding channel whose edgeway they seemed to everywhere explore.
They gave no sign of an idea that if they crossed the water at any point they could reach a solid and their destination.
They were manifestly guided by what was very minute in size and very near in osition.
But these minute things must be rememljered since the ant rightly orients herself by them after absences of considerable length.
The queens were shoved off the island by the workers.
They drifted rather than swam to the edgeway were hauled out by waiting workers and carried by them to the nest.
lany of the callows were carried all the way from the island to the nest while others followed adult workers all the time touching the leader with the antennae.
Occasionally three ants crossed thus in file.
On the morning of September 9 ten days after the ants had been placed on the island only one ciueen and seven workers remained there.
All the five queens without antennse had been transported to the nest as had all the young.
No loss of life or of young had occurred with the exception of about twenty newly hatched callows that had succumbed to the adverse conditions attending their hatching.
  I append an irrelevant note concerning an abnormal form uncommon in my antnests.
On August 25 1903 I found in one of my artificial nests of Stenamma fulvinn a recently hatched gynandromorphic ant bilaterally asymetrical.
The size form color and wings on the left side were those of the normal male while the right side was in all respects like that of a normal worker.
Regarding such abnormal insects Boveri Ueber Mehrpolige Mitosen als Mittel zur Analyze des Zellkerns 1902 presents the hypothesis that the first cleavage of the egg marking the future axis of the body occurred previous to fertilization that the spermatozoan then entered one blastomere producing on that side the female form while the other blastomere developed parthogenetically into the male form.

Note on Crotalus scutulatus Kenn.
 Mr. A. E. Brown stated that in a review of the species of North American snakes published in 1901 by the Academy he had considered Crotalus scutulatus Kenn.
to be a synonym of C. atrox B. and G. Lately the receipt of a living example from Pecos Texas had convinced him that they are distinct.
C. scutulatus has the scales on the upper surface of the head larger than in most Nearctic rattlesnakes there being but two scales between the supraorbitals in front and three behind.
Two or three rows below the suborbitals.
The rostral is triangular sharply emarginate and acuminate above.
Twentythree rows of scales.
The specimen is curiously intermediate in plan of markings between C. atrox and C. confluentus.
It has the strongly contrasted black tailbands of the former while elsewhere the dorsal spots are much like those of C. confluentus in shape in width of separation and in turning to crossbands on the hinder half of the body.
The oblique dark streak below the eye is intermediate both in breadth and direction and on top of the head the only distinct marking is a black blotch on the prefrontals the welldefined pattern of C. confluentus being absent.
Kennicott and Cope both regarded this species as nearer to atrox than appears to be true.
It is abundantly distinct and there is no need for a trinomial.
C. atrox sometimes presents enlarged head scales but never the dorsal spots turning to crossbars posteriorly.
C. confluentus on the other hand is wholly different in its markings on head and tail.
In its head scales the present species departs from both in the direction of C. molossus from which it is otherwise most unlike.
C. scutulatus is known from northern Mexico Arizona and in Texas .
only from Pecos and as reported by Mr. Boulenger from Duval county.
It is therefore Sonoran and does not appear to enter the Austroriparian.
The following were accepted for publication  40 A NEW AMERICAN GENUS OF ARIONIDS.
BY HENRY A. PILSBRY.
Among other mollusks received from the Rev.
E. H. Ashmun the fruits of his first season's collecting in Idaho were a few small slugs about the size of Agriolimax campestris Binn..
The dark color carinated tail and tripartite sole led me upon first glance to think it an immature Amalia but subseciuently upon opening one to confirm the identification it became at once obvious that an Arionid slug was before me  a slug not referable to any hitherto known species.
This slug shall be called Zacoleus idaJtocnsis.
It is from Meadows Washington county Idaho.
 ZACOLEUS gen. nov.
The genus Zacoleus may be briefly defined thus Ariolimacinse with the penis a simple sac continued beyond the insertion of the vas deferens duct of the spermatheca enormously enlarged marginal teeth with very long zonitoid mesocones no ectocones intestine but slightly twisted sole tripartite pneumostome behind the posterior third of the mantle  no caudal pore.
Central nervous system peculiar by the miusually long cerebral commissure and very short cerebrovisceral and cerebropedal connectives.
Zacoleus idahoensis n. sp.
Externally the slug is black on the mantle and back the flanks and head lighter slatecolored the neck or area around the anterior border of the mantle is dirty wdiite.
The reticulation is indistinct and longitudinal lines above oblique on the sides predominate somewhat as in Prophysaon cxruleum CklL.
Back of the mantle the body is keeled the tail strongly so.
The footmargin is rather narrow.
The sole is narrow yellowishwhite and divided by longitudinal grooves into three subequal areas.
There is no caudal pore but the acute tail appears somewhat abruptly truncate posteriorly in a view of the profile.
The oval mantle somewhat exceeds onethird the length of the body.
The pneumostome is situated between the  I am indebted to Mr. E. G. Vanatta for assistance in the examination of these slugs.
posterior third and fourth of its length.
One of the largest individuals measures length 14 breadth of sole 1.3 to 1.5 length of mantle 5.5 mm.
In more contracted individuals the sole is somewhat broader in front.
The wholly buried shell is calcareous and moderately strong oblong a little convex the left side more straightened than the right the slightly projecting blunt apex being terminal.
The surface is marked with growthstrige and seems to be without periostracum.
Length 2.5 width 1.5 mm.
The free retractor muscles are arranged as in Hesperarion and its allies the ocular retractors and the pharyngeal retractor being independent bands converging to the posterior edge of the mantlecavity where they are inserted in a group PI.

The genitalia PI.
XXVIII fig.
5 were imperfectly worked out. The penis p. is a stout oblong sac receiving the vas deferens a little distad of the middle of its length and its lumen is there contracted by a fleshy transverse body or sort of valve.
Above this the walls are thicker.
Both divisions are smooth within.
The small spermatheca sip.
is defined by a constriction from the duct sp.
d. which is a very capacious sac longer than the penis opening directly into the atrium.
Internally this relatively enormous duct has a few coarse longitudinal folds the number increasing toward the distal end where they are numerous.
Its structure aside from size is therefore what is ordinarily encountered.
No retractor muscle of the penis was seen probably owing to the ill preservation of the specimen or to imperfect attention in the early stage of the dissection.
The terminal duct only of the 
system could be traced ov..
The alimentary canal is constructed on the usual Arionid type though less twisted than in the related genera.
The jaw is opaque very thin arcuate and composed of numerous dark plaits or flat ribs separated by thin transparent much narrower intervals.
In one specimen examined there are over twentyfive narrow ribs PI.

The crop is long and capacious hardly separated from the stomach.
The intestine PI.

It is curved in figure ' The spirit first used on the specimens was apparently too weak to properly preserve the viscera and the genitalia and intestine were so soft and tender that their dissection was difficult.
8 fashion but only slightly twisted.
As in other native American Arionidce the posterior loop formed by the first and second folds of the intestine lies anterior to that formed by the third and fourth folds.
The radula has 31.1.33 teeth in two individuals counted.
The median tooth is tricuspid the lateral teeth bicuspid both being of the type frequently figured for American Arionidce.
There are seven laterals on each side PI.

The change to the marginals is gradual and produced by lengthening the main cusp and diminution of the ectocone PI.

The division of the lateral and marginal fields of the radula between the seventh and eighth teeth is obvious in a general view of the ribbon under a low power.
The marginal teeth PI.

The central nervous system PL XXVIII fig.
1 has the commissure between the cerebral ganglia long even for an Arionid slug.
These ganglia are obscurely bilobed.
The cerebropedal and cerebrovisceral connectives are on the other hand excessively short.
The suboesophageal group of ganglia exhibits stong concentration with the exception of the pedal mass.
Affinities of Zacoleus.
The contiguous posterior insertions of the free retractor muscles and the long cusps of the marginal teeth show that this genus belongs to the subfamily Ariolimacince as defined by Pilsbry and Vanatta. The tripartite sole peculiar genitalia total absence of ectocones on the Zonitoid marginal teeth and the extreme shortening of the side connectives of the circumoesophageal ring all distinguish this genus from its allies.
The tripartite sole it has in common with Binneya and Anadenulus both of which differ conspicuously in more important features.
Perhaps the tripartite sole was a character of the primitive Aulacopoda.
It seems to occur somewhat sporadically in some genera of several widely separated families of that group.
There is no indication of the autourotomy to coin a word of Prophysaon m our new genus Zacoleus thus stands isolated among known genera.

A NEW GENUS OF STENOPELMATIN ORTHOPTERA FROM NEW MEXICO.
BY JAMES A. G. REHN AND T. D. A. COCKERELL.
The material on which this genus is founded was collected in the vicinity of Pecos San Miguel county New JMexico in the summer of 1903 by Mrs. W. P. Cockerell.
Two specimens were taken the larger of which is the type of the genus and species.
It appears to be doubtful that it is mature but that it represents an entirely new type is beyond question.
The smaller specimen taken July 21 is in such condition and of such small size that nothing definite can be determined from it.
