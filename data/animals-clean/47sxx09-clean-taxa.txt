NEW SPECIES OF THE GENUS Cerion
BY H. A. PILSBRY AND E. G. YANATTA.
Mr. C. J. Maynard has lately made known certain characters of the internal teeth or lamella
of the species of the genus Cerion found by cutting the shell open.
By this means many species considerably alike externally are found to he well distinguished when their interiors are examined.
Mr. E. G. Vanatta having engaged to make the necessary sections a considerahle portion of the Cerious of the Academy's collection has been thus reviewed and various new species brought to light some of which may be briefly diagnosed as folloAvs further information and figures being reserved for a future communication   Cerion  Paracerion tridentatum Pilsbry and Yauatta.
Shell similar externally to C. incanum but aperture long ovate much higher than wide  cone of spire longer several whorls following the nepionic ones densely striate.
Parietal lamina small short central with a smaller accessory denticle to the left of and beyond its inner end and another lamina slightly to the right and deeper within.

This species and the next are peculiarly unlike all others known in being densely conspicuously spirally striated.

Surface densely spirally striate and hearing very stout distant ribs 11 on penult. one or two fewer on earlier whorls.

This is really the most remarkable form of Cerion yet discovered allied to C. felis in sculpture but in the tapering contour wholly unlike anything known hitherto in the genus with the exception of Phjxi scalarina Gundl.
 which is much smaller with less attenuated earlier whorls.
Cerion Maynardia columna 1'.

Differs from the closely allied G. infanda in the smaller and colored aperture less compressed bodywhorl etc.
 from G. reginu it differs in the more elongate form colored mouth and less excavated umbilical tract  from  '.
regium in the more slender contour etc.
It resembles in shape Pupa cretacea Pfr.
 but that species is far more obtuse than any of the dozen specimens of this before us.
A variety which may be called v. valida is smaller strongly and subregularlv costate throughout.

Turk's Island Swift Gabb.
This species has affinities with C. columna of Inagua G. regium of Castle Island C. lentiginosum and G. album of Rum Cay.
The first is more elongated and pillarlike with very dark mouth  the second is stouter heavier with far wider thicker lip  in fact a lip of quite Ethiopian characteristics and the two forms from Rum Cay are distinguished from all the preceding by the close even microscopic costulation of their earlier whorls.
C. regina percostatum P. and V. Form of shell and mouth as in G. regina but whole surface except nepionic apex regularly ribbed as in Strophia alba Mayn.
 except that the ribs on cylindrical portion are wider spaced.
White much mottled and clouded with brown.
Holds the same relation to  '.

This form looks very distinct from C. regina and we have no intermediate specimens but it occurs on the same small island and may prove to be only a subspecies of that form.

Cerion Maynardia Maynardi P. and V. Shell large strong cylindrical white or fleshy in the intervals between strong slightly curved ribs separated by three times their width on the cylindrical portion which consists of 3 to 4 whorls those above forming a short cone on which the ribs are much closer.
Whorls 111 flat the last ascending becoming attenuated downward but with well rounded base upon which the ribs are obsolete but replaced by fine costuhe.
Umbilical rimation very deep the area below it rather wide bounded by a spiral groove well within the basal margin of umbilical tract.
Aperture ovatetruncate brown within parietal lamina very strong thick but short axial lamina small one whorl long.
Peristome stout broadly reflexed its face convexly thickened but not duplicate broadly vaulted over the umbilical region parietal callus varying from thin to heavy.

Shell cylindrical the lower three whorls of equal diameter those above tapering rapidly to form a short coue white mottled with fleshycorneous above or having this color appear in sparse streaks or in most or all the intervals between the opaque white riblets throughout the shell.
Surface evenly regularly and closely ribbed the ribs separated by intervals slightly greater than their own width about 29 on penult whorl.

Last whorl rounded below.
Umbilical chink much compressed the tract below it semilunar defined by a groove.

While superficially like C. striatellum the different armature of the parietal wall at once distinguishes this species.
The parietal lamina is much reduced almost absent in some specimens.

Mr. Henry A. Pilsbry was elected a Curator for the unexpired term of the late Dr. W. S. W. Ruschenberger.
April 9.
The President General Wistar in the Chair.
Twentyfour persons present.
The following minute was presented from the Biological and Microscopical Section and unanimously adopted  JOHN A. RYDER Ph.
D. In view of the death of our colleague Dr. John A. Ryder it is the sense of the Biological and Microscopical Section of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia that a minute be recorded to express the great regret of the Section and its deep appreciation of the loss it has sustained in his untimely decease.
Dr. Ryder was elected a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia January 29 1878 and shortly after that date began to attend the meetings of the Section and frequently made interesting communications.
He became a member of the Section November 15 1886 and at the annual meeting in the same year he was chosen Director which office he held until the close of.
1888.
Many of his communications made before the Section were verbal and were to a large extent a resume or report of his own current work and also of that of other investigators at home and abroad who were working in lines similar to his own.
The subjects treated in these communications included myology embryology histology microscopic technique malacology comparative anatomy and kindred biological studies.
Most of these communications afterward appeared in print in the Proceedings of the Academy or elsewhere.
16 Dr. Ryder's earnestness of purpose and intense interest in his studies could not fail to impress and stimulate his fellow members while his wonderful memory and obliging disposition were often appealed to by them and it was very rarely that he could not furnish the desired information.
Especially was this true of his knowledge and recollection of scientific literature  on many subjects he could give an almost complete bibliography from memory.
In deeply deploring the early death of Dr. Ryder which occurred at the height of his scientific vigor the Section but voices the sentiment of the entire biological world.
