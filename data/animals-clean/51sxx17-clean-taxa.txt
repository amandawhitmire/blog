THE VOLES COLLECTED BY DR. W. L. ABBOTT IN CENTRAL ASIA.
BY GEPvRIT g. MILLER JR. During three recent expeditious in Central Asia Dr. W. L. Abbott collected fiftyfour voles representing the following ten species.
These specimens form part of the large collection of Asiatic mammals which he has presented to the United States National Museum.

Type locality.
 Between Spiti and Pankong lake eastern Kashmir.
Specimens collected by Dr. Abbott.
 Thirtyfour twenty skins fourteen in formalin.
The specimens were all taken in Ladak where Dr. Abbott found the species the most abundant vole common on all grassy plains bordering lakes and streams between the altitudes of 14000 feet and 16000 feet.
The following are the exact localities represented  Tsokr Chumo lake 15000 feet.
Kupchen Rupshu 15000 feet.
Ooti Rupshu 15500 feet.
Rupshu 16000 feet.
Hanle district 16000 feet.
Banks of Hanle river 15000 feet.
Chibra Hanle river 14000 feet.
West side of Pognor lake 16000 feet.
Above Tsomoriri lake 16000 feet.
Karzok Tsomoriri altitude not stated.
Colo I'.
 The series of skins shows no considerable variation in color.
In summer pelage the back is light woodbrown strongly tinged with yellowish and very faintly darkened by an even sprinkling of long blackish haii's which in many specimens are more noticeable on neck and region behind shoulders than elsewhere.
Sides clear buff belly like sides but paler and irregularly clouded by the appearance on the surface of the dark underfur.
Tail pale buff slightly paler below.
Feet dirty white.
 The autumn coat vhich is beginning to appear in specimens taken late in August and early in September is slightly less yellow.
Halfgrown young are duller and lrowner than the adults.
These immature specimens show a more strongly contrasted though actually duller buffy lateral area.
Feet.
 Both palms and soles are 5tuberculate.
On the soles a rudimentary sixth tubercle is distinguishable in two quartergrown individuals preserved in formalin.
Mammce.
 On the label of an adult female taken above Tsomoriri July 31 1897 Dr. Abbott records the number of mammai as four pectoral and four inguinal.
I find a like number in each of two females preserved in formalin.
Skull.
 The series of fifteen perfect adult skulls shows the slight range of individual variation usually met with in species of 3Iicrotus.
The most variable characters appear to be the form of the interparietal the extent of the constriction near the middle of the nasals the extent of the forward projection of the upper incisors and the size of the audital bullae.
The development of the audital 1899.
283 bullse appears to be less iu the females since I find it jiossible to select the majority of the female skulls iu the series by reference to this character alone.

Teeth.
 The enamel pattern is remarkably constant.
The last loop of the posterior upper tooth is occasionally somewhat more abruptly curved than usual on the outer Oilv side so that the last salient angle is cut v V M nJ iff as a rudimentary closed triangle.
The variation necessary to bring about this result is however very trifling.

Skull.
 The skull of Microtusravidulus though of the same type as that of M. arvalis from Germany is readily distinguishable by its slightly greater length and by the narrowness and great depth of the braincase.
The form of the braincase is much like that of M. Pedomis austerus.
Interorbital constriction narrow the constricted region unusually long.
Zygomatic arches not widely flaring the outer borders nearly parallel not strongly convergent anteriorly as in 31. arvalis in the region opposite postorbital processes.
Rostrum heavier than in M. arvalis but not conspicuously different in form.

larger than in M. arvais but the enamel pattern in the two species is identical.
Specimens examined.
 Five all from the type locality.
Remarks.
 Although a member of another subgenus Microtusraviclidus bears a strong superficial resemblance to 21. hlytlii.
The colors of the two species are almost precisely the same but M. ravidulus aside from its subgeneric characters can be distinguished by the dark dorsal surface of the tail coarser fur and more conspicuous dark ' lining ' of back.
The four skins show no important variations in color.
Microtusravidulus is closely related to M. tianschanicus Buchuer from the Juldus Valley.
In size color and cranial characters the two species apparently agree perfectly but the five specimens of M. ravidulus have the front lower molar of 31. arvalis instead of the very peculiar tooth described and figured by Biichner as occurring without exception in the seven specimens of J tianschanicus collected by Przewalski.
In only one of the latter is there a faint trace of a fourth outer salient angle and this tooth is specially figured as abnormal.
Although both animals occur on the south side of the great Tianschan mountain chain they are some four hundred miles apart and probably completely insulated by the Chalyk and Beschan mountains which would undoubtedly act as barriers to austral species.
Dr. Abbott tells me that this vole was abundant in the grain fields of the comparatively low fertile valley about Okchi.
It occurred together with a species of Cricetulus and one or both of the animals laid up abundant underground stores each containing about a pint of barley heads.
Strangely enough this habit was not known to the owners of the fields.

General characters.
 Size medium tail short ears moderate scarcely overtopping fur color uniform pale brown above whitish below skull heavily built and angular upper incisors conspicuously protruding  two anterior triangles in first lower molar open  posterior loop of back upper molar nearly straight.
Fur and color.
 The fur is full and soft that on middle of back about 12 mm.
in length.
It is everywhere slategray at base.
Color of dorsal surface light broccolibrown very uniform and only inconspicuously sprinkled with darker hairs.
Ventral surface grayish white strongly clouded anteriorly by the dark bases of the hairs.
Feet whitish.
Tail whitish with a very inconspicuous dusky dorsal stripe.
Feet.
 The soles and palms were slit open by the collector so that it is impossible to determine the number and position of the tubercles.

Type.
appearance it strongly suggests an approach to Phaiomys.
This is due chiefly to the protruding upper incisors and the short strongly cuueate nasals.
The whole skull is angular and heavily built much broader than that of M. arvalis from Germany though of about the same length.
Nasals shorter than in 3f.
arvalis and much broader anteriorly.
Zygomatic arches strongly flaring anteriorly nearly parallel in region opposite postorbital processes.
Interparietal rectangular the anteroposterior breadth about half the lateral breadth.
Braincase squarish in outline broader than in M. arvalis but of about the same depth.
luterorbital constriction relatively less narrow than in Jf.
arvalis but constricted region of about the same length.
Palate normal the lateral pits well developed though shallower than in 31. arvalis.
Audital bullte about the same size as in 31. arvalis but flatter.
Incisive foramen considerably broader anteriorly than posteriorly.

Teeth.
 Attention has already been called to the strongly projecting upper incisors.
The molars are heavier than in 31. arvalis.
In general appearance the enamel pattern is less compact than in 31. arvalis while the details in the two species differ considerably.
The posterior upper molar contains an anterior transverse loop a small outer closed triangle a larger one on the inner side and a long terminal longitudinal loop provided with a welldeveloped salient angle on each side anteriorly.
Behind each of these salient angles is a rounded reentrant angle.
As the inner of these saHent angles and its corresponding reentrant angle are the more strongly developed as well as the more posterior in position the terminal loop is bowed very slightly inward.
It is however essentially straight as compared with the corresponding region in 31. arvalis.
Middle upper molar tetramerodont.
The front lower molar contains the same elements as in 3f.
arvalis but the two anterior triangles open freely into the terminal loop.
This character may prove to be individual though I am inclined to believe that it is normal.
The enamel pattern of the remaining teeth is like that of M. arvalis.
Specimens examined.
 Dr. Abbott collected only one specimen of this species.
Remarks.
 Microtxis pamirensis differs too widely from any described form to require detailed comparison.

Krishnagunga valley 7000 feet.
Central Kashmir 12000 feet.
This species occurs in the mountain parks Avell below timber line.
From the information given me by Dr. Abbott I should suppose that its faunal position is lower boreal.
In the middle boreal and upper boreal it is replaced by members of the subgenera Phaiomys and AUicola.
Color.
 The five skins show no marked variation in color.
In all the entire dorsal surface is a fine grizzle of dull woodbrown and sealbrown the result of which is a general tint not far from sepia.
Such variation as occurs is due to slight differences in the balance Ijetween the component colors.
On the sides and belly the sealbrown disappears and the woodbrown changes to a yellowish clay color varying slightly in intensity and in the amount of clouding due to the dark bases of the hairs.
Tail obscurely bicolor sepia above dirty whitish beneath.
Feet dusky sepia varying considerably in depth occasionally almost blackish.
Skull.
 Three skulls show little variation beyond that due to differences in age.
The skull of the type is the oldest and most angular.

General characters.
 Precisely similar to MicrotusfertUis True but with much smaller ears.
Fur and color.
 In length and quality of fur as well as in color the types of Mkrotm fertilis and 31. brachelix resemble each other so exactly that it would be difficult to find two skins more perfectly alike.
Ears.
 The ears ai'e small much overtopped by the surrounding fur.
while in 31. fertilis they are about equal to the fur in length.
The reduction in height is especially noticeable along the upper edge of the anterior border which is reduced to the merest rim.
Skull and teeth.
 In cranial and dental characters 3Iicrotus brachelix agrees perfectly with 31. fertilis.
Remarks.
 I should hesitate to separate 3ficrotus brachelix from 31. fertilis on the single character of the size of the ears did not the five specimens of the latter show perfect uniformity among themselves.
Even in a half grown specimen of 3f.
fertilis the ears are much larger than in the type of 3f.

Remarks.
 Microtusalbicauda is apparently most closely related to M. stracheyi and M. cricetulus.
With both of these it agrees in color and in general size.
From the former it is separable by its simpler m 1 from the latter by its more complex m 3 longer tail and more lightly built skull.
From M. blanfordi it is distinguishable at a glance by its shorter more closely haired entirely white tail.

 The skull of Microtuscricetulus is in all respects that of a typical Alticola.
The brain case is rounded in outhne when viewed from above the interorbital region is broad with a distinct median furrow and the nasals are very large.
Postorbital processes small but distinct.
Viewed from the side the skull is strongly cuneate in outline owing to the nearly flat dorsal profile deep brain case prominent audital bullae and slender rostrum.
It differs from the skull of M. albicauda its nearest ally in slightly larger size a little more highly arched brain case and in the larger size and more anterior position of the rostral protuberances.
The nasal branches of the premaxillaries are narrower than in M. albicauda.
They terminate on a line with the posterior extremity of the nasals while in 3f.
albicauda they extend considerably behind the nasals.

Teeth.
 Both upper and lower incisors are very pale yellow on their anterior faces contrasting strongly with the deep orange incisors of M. albicauda.
Molars noticeably heavier than in 3f.
albicauda but enamel pattern with a single exceptioD exactly the same.
In M. albicauda the inner base of the posterior loop of the back upper molar is produced into a conspicuous salient angle.
In M. cricetulus this angle is completely absent no trace of it appearing in any of the four specimens.
The character however may prove to be inconstant when large series of specimens are available for comparison.

nov. Tyjye adult 
skin and skull No.
62162 United States National Museum collected on the Ladak side of the Kara Korum Pass altitude 17000 feet July 25 1893 by Dr. W. L. Abbott.
General characters.
 Closely related to Microtusstoliczlcanus Blanford but with shorter tail and much paler color.
Fur and color.
 Fur full and soft about 15 mm.
long on middle of back.
Basal twothirds of hairs slaty plumbeous shghtly paler than in Microtusalhicauda and M. cricetulus.
On the dorsal surface the plumbeous basal area is followed by a broad band of pinkish buff which gives the general tone to the pelage.
Throughout the dorsal surface the fur is sprinkled with longer dark brown hairs but these are nowhere conspicuous.
The buff is brightest on the head and lumbar region paler and grayer across shoulders along sides and on rump.
Belly snowy white much clouded by the plumbeous under fur.
Feet and tail dirty white.
Ears.
 The ears are of about the same size as in M. cricetulus but owing to the longer surrounding fur they appear much shorter and less conspicuous.
Feet.
 Palms 5tuberculate  soles 6tuberculate.
All tubercles very large.
Soles densely hairy behind tubercles.
MammcB.
 Mammae eight four pectoral and four inguinal.
Skull.
 The skull of Microtusacrophilus is similar in general form to that of M. alhicauda and M. cricetulus but is slightly larger than either and much more massively built.
Zygomatic arches shorter and rostrum broader and deeper than in M. albiCauda or 3.
cricetulm.
Nasal branches of premaxillaries narrow scarcely reaching posterior edge of nasals.
Mandible larger than in M. cricetulus but with much more slender angular process.
Measurements of type skull  greatest length 28  basal length 27 basilar length 25.4 zygomatic breadth 16.4 mastoid breadth 13 interorbital constriction 5  length of nasals 8.8 anterior breadth across nasals 3.8 posterior breadth across nasals 2 diastema 8.8 palatal length 14 occipital depth 8.4 fronto palatal depth at middle of molar series 7.4 mandible 18 maxillary toothrow alveoli 7 mandibular toothrow alveoh 6.8.
Teeth.
 Incisors pale yellow as in 31. cricetulus.
Molars much heavier than in M. cricetulus but enamel pattern exactly similar. The salient angles are however less acute and the terminal loop of the posterior upper molar forms less than half of the length of the tooth crown instead of slightly more than half as in M. albicauda and 31. cricetulm.
Specimem examined.
 Dr. Abbott took only one specimen of Microtia acrophilus.
On the label he writes  Vast numbers inhabit the cliff of conglomerate at sides of the nullah issuing forth at evening.
Country absolutely destitute of vegetation.
Remarks.
 This species is closely related to 3Iicrotus stoliczkanus but is readily distinguishable by its short tail and very pallid color.
