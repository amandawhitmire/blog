OBSERVATIONS UPON THE PLACENTA AND YOUNG OF Dasypus SEXCINCTUS.
BY HEXRY C. CHAPMAN M. D. The Edentata so called by Cuvier on account of the teeth being so imperfectly developed or absent in the representatives of the order includes a very heterogeneous assemblage of animals  anteaters sloths armadillos  differing very much in their internal organization especially in the character of their placeutation.
Thus the placenta in the Cape anteater Orijctwopiis is deciduous and according to some authorities discoidal to others zonular inform.
In theTamandua T. tetradactyla it is possibly deciduous and discoidal' in the sloths Chokcpus Hoffnianni it is deciduous and loboid in form'' in the Pangolin Manisf nondeciduous and diffuse in certain species of armadillos e. g. Dasypus novemcindus possibly deciduous and discoidal In view of the fact that such profound differences exist in the placentation of the Edentata il is hoped that the following observations upon the placenta and young of the sixbanded armadillo born in the Philadelphia Zoological Garden and submitted to the author for examination by JNIr.
A. E. Brown Secretarv of the Society will prove acceptable.
It should be mentioned in this connection that in the case of the placenta of Dasypus novemcinctas as described by MilneEdwards four foetuses wei'e found enclosed in one chorion.
Such a disposition far from being an abnormal one would seem to be that usually obtaining at least in that species of armadillo since the same number of foetuses were  T. H. Huxley Introduction to the Classification of Animals LondoD 1869 pp.

cit. p. 2. observed enclosed iu a coiumou chorion by Kolliker before and by Duges after Milne Edwards' observations.
Different explanations have been offered by anatomists of this apparent anomaly of one chorion enclosing a number of foetuses.
The most satisfactory as yet offered though hypothetical the early development of the armadillo being unknown is that originally the number of chorions correspond to the number of foetuses but that as development advances the adjacent walls of the primitively distinct chorions fuse together and ultimately break down the result being the formation of one chorion.
In the case of the sixbanded armadillo Dasypus sexdnctus the mother gave birth to but one young and there were no reasons for supposing that more than one was developed during the pregnancy.
The young armadillo Plate XVIIl fig.
1 the fu'st born at the Philadelphia Zoological Garden a aiale which lived but a few hours was perfectly developed and measured from snout to end of tail 25 centimeters 10 inches.
The most striking feature of the young animal externally was the size of the penis it measuring 3.7 centimeters 1.5 inches.
It is well known that this organ attains an enormous size in the adult armadillo absolutely as well as relatively.
Six distinct broad bauds and two indistinct narrow ones were observed on the dorsal surface but they were as yet soft to the touch.
No trace was found of an umbilical vesicle amnion or any part of the chorion except that entering into the formation of the placenta.
The umbilical cord measured 22.5 centimeters 9 inches the vessels not being spirally disposed as was also observed by MilneEdwards to be the case in the Tamandua.
The umbilical vessels were so much torn having been apparently gnawed ly the mother as to make it impossible to inspect the placenta through them.
A mixture of gelatine and carmine was however forced directly into a few of the small vessels of the placenta which consisted of the villous processes of the chorion only without admixture of any maternal tissue and was therefore noudeciduate.
The foetal villi were disposed as a girdle or zone Plate XVIII fig.

The zoue measured from outer edge to outer edge about 5 centimeters 2 inches the average breadth of the rim of the zone 1.2 centimeters .5 inch the breadth of the space between the inner edges of the zone and destitute of villi 2.5 centimeters 1 inch.
The placenta in the sixbanded armadillo is not however a zonular one in the sense in which that word is used byanatomists.
It does not surround the chorion as a broad baud the poles of the latter being bare as in the  diffuse  nondeciduate placenta of the pig  nor as a narrow one as in the  zonular  deciduous placenta of the Carnivoraetc.
It should be regarded morphologically rather as a discoidal placenta the central portion of the disk  ihat is the part of the chorion lying within the inner edges of the rims of the villous zoue  presenting however no villi.
The placenta in Dasypus sexcinctiis being therefore ringshaped rather than discoid in form if it be permitted to introduce a new name in anatomical nomenclature it might be described as a nondeciduate cricoid placenta.
The villi measuring on an average 20 mm.
.8 inch were not simple as in the Pachydermata Camelidte and Tragulide but compound as in Man.
They presented a beautiful arborescent appearance Plate XVIII fig.

As is well known Von Baer'' Eschricht' the elder Milne Edwards Huxley and in recent times Haeckel' advocated classifying the monodelphous mammalia according to the character of the placentation.
It is obvious however as shown by the summary given below that on such a basis the differcnt members of the Edentata would be associated with mammals with which they have no natural affinities just as according to such classification totally different animals like the Hyrax Elephant and Carnivoraare associated and which constitutes one of the most important objections that have been urged to the acceptance of such classification.
