CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ZOOLOGY OF TENNESSEE.
No.
4 MOLLUSKS.
BY HENRY A. PILSBRY AND SAMUEL N. RHOADS. The following paper concludes the annotated lists of the animals of Tennessee collected and observed by Mr. Rhoads which have appeared in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia beginning with page 376 in the volume for 1895.
The reader is referred to this article for an itinerary of the journey through Tennessee during which the collection of mollusks here enumerated was secured.
The list is restricted exclusively to the collection made by Mr. Rhoads in May and June 1895 no attempt being made as in previous papers of this series to complete the list.
The literature of Tennessee mollusks is extensive nearly all general works on the North American land and fresh water forms containing descriptions of or references to species from the state.
There are however but few special papers on shells of this area.
Dr. James Lewis published in the American Journal of Conchology VI 1870 p. 188191  Notes on the Land Shells of East Tennessee based on specimens collected by Miss Annie E. Law.
Pases 216226 contain an article  On the Shells of the Holston River by the same author likewise from Miss Law's collection.
Tryon in Amer.
Jour.
Conch. VII p. 86 reviews Dr. Lewis' notes on Holston River Strepomatide. A third paper by Lewis  Shells of Tennessee No.
2 collected by Miss Law appears in Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia for 1872 pp.
108115.
A number of other papers by Dr. Lewis in the same Proceedings and by Prof. A. G. Wetherby in the Journal of the Cincinnati Society of Natural History deal mainly with Tennessee mollusks.
In species of Unionidce Tennessee is wonderfully rich.
The western part of the state represented in the collection here recorded  Prof. H. A. Pilsbry of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia and his assistant Mr. E. G. Vanatta identified the entire collection.
Chas.
T. Simpson of the National Museum has kindly examined and reported on a number of ambiguous and difficult Unionidse.
All annotations are made by Mr. Pilsbry.
by the forms taken at Reelfoot Lake has the typical northern Mississippi fauna with a few southwestern species.
The special character of the Tennessee River system is well known to conchologists  but among the species herein catalogued from middle and east Tennessee will be found a number of forms described from Alabama Louisiana and other localities to the south and west such as Unio propinquus U.
ybasii U. turgidus U. tiimescens U. caliginosus etc.

Most Tennessee specimens of this species are more coarsely and strongly ribbed than northern and western examples and there is often a more or less pronounced peripheral keel.
The culmination of this type of shell is P. alternata mordax of which however no specimens were taken at localities recorded above.
The form called var.
carinata contrasts with these being very fineribbed and distinctly carinated and not at all of the mordax type.
Peculiarly depressed but not keeled specimens occurred at Sawyer's Springs.

Bank Emory Riv. near Harriman 68634.
This species was first found living in the West by Messrs. Pilsbry and Shimek but has subsequently occurred to conchologists in many localities in Iowa Minnesota and Wisconsin.
In the East it occurs living in Western Pennsylvania Green near Pittsburg Stupakoff in Virginia western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee.
Its range is apparently interrupted by the Ohio Valley and the special localities east and west are more or less isolated.
Its distribution is on the whole more markedly discontinuous than that of any American land snail known to me.
It probably lives in higher latitude than any other member of the Helicinidce.
H. occulta is an omnipresent and therefore characteristic fossil of the Mississippi Valley loess  and during the formation of that deposit was extensively diffused and excessively numerous over a large area where it is now extinct.

Family PLEUROCERID Fischer.
This has long been recognized as one of the most difficult families of American mollusks.
Tryon made a good beginning in the intricate study of its species in his monograph published by the Smithsonian Institution in 1872.
His conclusions were based upon a study of material from all the principal collections of that time  and his extensive synonymy has proved in nearly every case which has since been tested to be singularly well judged.
It was a splendid piece of work considering the time and material available.
But Tryon himself in his later years saw as clearly as anyone that a vastly greater reduction of species must be made.
He told me in 1888 that as he now saw these shells there were not more than a tenth as many good species as names.
Whether the particular ratio mentioned was deliberately said or not I do not know  but I incline to the belief that it will prove near the truth.
These shells must be collected and studied by riversystems  and it then appears that often the same species occurs in some localities sculptured throughout in others only on the upper portion while in still other places only the earlier whorls may show the characteristic sculpture.
Some of the species described from one or two decollate examples will be recognized with great difficulty if at all in cases where the type locality is not known.
A cursory glance at the generic scheme in current use reveals some inaccuracies which call for correction.
The genera are unequally related and as Tryon has shown fall into three main groups.
They are as follows  lo Lea 1831 type Fusis fluvialis Say.
Melafusus Swainson 1840 is a synonym.
LiTHASiA Hald. 1840 type Anculosa Ldthasia geniculata Hald.
A section of Lithasia is Angitrema Hald. 1841 type Melania armigera Say Glotella Gray 1847 same type being a synonym of Angitrema.
It will be observed that this reverses Tryon's usage as he places geniculata in Angitrema and restricts Lithasia to smooth species.
Angitrema is a connecting link between lo and Lithasia and seems conchologically about intermediate between the two groups.

from the M. inargaritifera and monodonta  and Simpson finds numbers of otlier incongruous elements.
We are hardly prepared however to merge the various groups of  Margariinna in Unio.
Among other disadvantages a great many specific names would require change such as the first one of this list  and then tliere is a Teal difference in the hinge teeth which would be without recognition in nomenclature.
It seems to us that although there are a few forms such as Unio preKnus in which this distinction is obscure still in the great majority it holds.
The subject is a complex one which should not be decided hastily and we can well afford to postpone wholesale changes in specific nomenclature until Simpson von Ihering and other specialists who are now working upon the Unionidn' with such gratifying results shall have arrived at a thoroughly mature classification.
FOSSIL BONES OF BIRDS AND MAMMALS FROM GROTTO PIETRO TAMPONI AND GRIVEST. ALBAN.
BY R. W. 8HUFELDT M. D. For some time past the writer has had in his possession a small collection of fossil bones that were kindly submitted to him by Mr. Jno.
Eyerman of Easton Pennsylvania to whose cabinet they belong.
These fossil bones are from birds and mammals and were obtained from two very different localities the smaller lot of the two having been collected at the Grotto Pietro Tamponi and the remainder of them at GriveSt. Alhan in France.
In his letter of transmittal Mr. Eyerman invites my attention to the fact that the celebrated locality GriveSt. Alban 'is situated in the department of Isere France the deposits belonging to the upper division of the Middle Miocene.
European geologists have arranged the Middle Miocene into two divisions of which the upper is distributed principally in isolated patches throughout France although these deposits are also found in Germany and in the Vienna Basin.
 GriveSt. Alban is justly famous for the large number and great variety of mammalian remains found in its beds of which we have Listriodon Hyotherium Palaeomeryx Micromeryx Dicroceros of the Artiodactyla as well as the earliest antelope Profraoceros.
Of the Perissodactyla there are the hornless rhinoceros Aceratherium Chalicotherium.
Of the Proboscidea there is the Mastodon augustidens.
The Rodentia is represented by Lagomys Myoxus Sciurus Chalicomys and the large Dormouse Cricetodon.
The Carnivora by Viverra Lxdra D'lnocyon the sabretooth tiger Machaerodus  the mongoose Berpestes and the disputed genus Haplogale of Sclosser.
The Insectivores by Plesiosorex Erinaceus and Talpa and finally the fossil Gibbon Hylobates.
In the second locality or that of Tavolara we find the  Grotto Pietro Tamponi consisting of several chambers and situated on the small Island of Tavolara in the Gulf of Terranova a few miles off the northeast coast of Sardinia.
The upper chamber of this grotto contains numerous remains of the rodent Lagomys sardus Giebel's variety corsicanus.
The lower chamber has produced the avian remains.
Taking these specimens by their original numbers I find them to be as represented in the following list   1.
The left carpometacarpus of a bird.
2.
The left radius of a bird.
3.
The right tibiotarsus of a bird.

These specimens are all from adult individuals of the various species they represent they are furthermore thoroughly fossilized  free from any matrix save in a few instances where a thin layer of a darkcolored incrustation spreads over the ends of some of the long and other bones.
They are very light in color and upon the whole quite perfect.
Some are thoroughly so as for example Nos.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and 20 others exhibit a little chipping at the extremities or have other slight imperfections as for example Nos.
11 17 19 21 22 25 and 26 while finally the balance are more or less fragmentary as set forth in the above list.
No.
7 is a femur that apparently belonged to a mediumsized rodent but as I have not the proper material wherewith to compare it it is impossible fur me to identify the species.
It has a total length of 4.9 centimeters and presents the usual characters seen in a small rodent's femur as that for example of one of the Seiuridse or some of their near allies.
The vIna in lot No.
10 and the end of the femur in No.
27 also belong to small mammals but from lack of material I am unable to identify them.
The firstmentioned specimen has a length of 4 centimeters while the last is fragmentary and I take it to be a mammal from the fact that no fibular notch exists in the posterior aspect of the external condyle  a common avian character.
A study of specimens Nos.
1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 the tarsometatarsus of lot No.
10 and No.
11 convinced me that they had one and all belonged to species of Shearwater Puffinus.
This conviction was arrived at after comparing the bones with those of a skeleton of Puffinns borealis and with the figures and descriptions given us by Professor Alf MilneEdwards in his Recherches sur les Oiseaux Fossiles de la France. Furthermore the tibiotarsus No.
3 agreed exactly in length and in characters with the specimen No.
9 while in the case of the femora in lot No.
5 and the humeri in lot No.
6 although they agreed in characters differed in either case somewhat in length.
This however amounted to but very little  for example one of the femora measured 4.0 cms.
in length and the other 3.9 cms.
in length whereas in the case of the humeri this difference is a little greater one having a length of 7.9 cms.
and the other only 7.5 cms.

where they are with others described.
Disregarding the cnemial projection or process and measuring the length of the bone from the summit to the lowermost point of the outer condyle we found that the tibiotarsus of No.
3 has a length of 6.7 cms while a similar measurement of the tibiotarsus No.
11 is found to be 7.4 cms.
In this latter specimen the cnemial process has been broken off and lost.
So great a distance as this leads me to believe that this longer bone belonged to a different species of Ptiffinus and that the tarsometatarsus marked No.
10 probably belonged to the same species.
Indeed I believe that the bones Nos.
10 and 11 belonged to the same individual inasmuch as they articulate perfectly when brought together.
So far as I have been able to discover there have been but few remains of fossil bones of the genus Puffinus described.
Two of these are to be found in M. MilneEdwards's work Oiseaux Fossil es de la France T. II where upon page 588 he says  Le Puffinus conradi provient du Miocene du Maryland  ses dimensions se rapprochaient de celles du Puffin cendre Puffima cinereus Gmelin de la cote occidentale d'Amerique and again on page 572 in speaking of Puffinus arvernensis  rare a Langy be says  Cette espece ayant ete decouverte depuis la publication du chapitre relatif aux oiseaux fossiles de cette famille sera decrite et figuree dans un travail suppiemen taire.
Upon comparing the bones before me with the figures of the corresponding ones of Pvffimis cinereus as given us by MilneEdwards I find that the latter species is very considerably larger than were either of the former so that bones Nos.
10 and 11 did not belong to a specimen of Ptiffinus conradi.
In order to make certain that M. MilneEdwards had not described Puffinus arvernensis I wrote him concerning that species and received the following reply accompanied by the drawings he mentions Plate XXIV figs.
1 and 2 for both of which distinguished favors my most sincere thanks are here tendered.
Museum D'Histoire Naturelle Direction 9 Juillet 1896.
Cher Monsieur  Je m' empresse de vous envoyer un dessin du tarsometatarsien du Puffinus arvernensis de St Gerand le Puy.
Je dois decrire cette espece dans un supplement a mon Oiseaux fossiles mais yous pouvez faire tel usage qui vous conviendrai du dessin etle publier si vous le desirez il est fait de grandeur naturelle.
Croyez cher Monsieur a mon sentiments tres distingus.
A. MilneEdwards.
Unfortunately among the bones of the smaller species of Piiffinns before me there occurred no specimen of a tarsometatarsus so that I am unable to say whether they belong to the species described by Professor MilneEdwards naPuffinus arvernensis or not.
Nevertheless upon measuring across the condyles at their lower aspects and taking a similar transverse diameter of the summit of the tarsometatarsus in Professor MilneEdwards' drawing it becomes evident that Paffinns arvernensis must have had a tibiotarsus quite like the one shown in figure 9 of the plate.
In other words I believe the fossil bones of the smaller species of Puffinus in Mr. Eyerman's collection very probably belonged to one or two individuals of the type referred to by Professor MilneEdwards as P. arvernensis.
which species is based upon the tarsometatarsus shown in figures 1 and 2.
In any event there is so much likelihood of this being the case that I do not at present feel justified in describing these bones as having belonged to a species unknown to science up to the present writing.
These bones have all the characters of the corresponding ones as found in the skeleton of the Shearwater P. horealis before me with the exception of some differences in the tibiotarsi and the humeri.
In the former the cnemial crests are much produced upward as in Puffinus cinereus and call to mind this bone in the Grebes  while in the latter there is a very remarkable flattening of the bone in the same plane in which the radial crest lies.
This flattening is wellshown in figure 7 of the plate.
As has already been said above the tarsometatarsus in lot No.
10 and the tibiotarsus No.
11 undoubtedly belonged to a larger species of Puffinus and one probably smaller than the P. conradi of Marsh  in fact to a form having a size between P. arvernensis and P. conradi and hitherto undescribed.
Therefore I propose the following for this species   Puffinus eyermani n. sp.
Based on a tibiotarsus and a tarsometatarsus both of the right side.
They belonged to adult individuals or what is more likely to the one and same individual as the bones articulate together perfectly.
Disregarding the fractured remains of the cnemial crest of the tibiotarsus and measuring between summit and lowest point of condyle this bone has a length of 7.4 cms while the tarsometatarsus is 5.2 cms.
long.
They both present characters agreeing in the main with the corresponding ones in Puffinus cinereus GmeL The shaft of the tibiotarsus is somewhat flattened or compressed in the anteroposterior direction and its distal third to some degree curves gently mesiad.
The fibular ridge is wellmarked and occupies rather more than the upper third of the external border of the bone.
Distal
' we find the usual osseous bridgelet spanning the deep tendinal groove upon the anterior aspect.
In the intercondylar space posteriorly there is a faint indication of a median longitudmal lidge that is also visible in Piiffinus borealis fig.
8.
The tarsometatarsus Plate XXIV figs.
3 and 4 is straight and is grooved for tendons the entire length of its anterior face and faintly so upon its posterior aspect.
Distally the midtrochlear process is placed the lowest on the end of the shaft while the internal one is the highest and is directed backward and slightly inward.
The hypotarsus is welldeveloped and is twice vertically pierced for the passage of tendons while faint groovings also exist upon its posteroexternal surface.
In the fossa at the proximal end of the bone just below the summit are two small foramina piercing the shaft from before backward.
The sides of the shaft are flat.
These bones were discovered in the Grotto Pietro Tamponi Tavolara an island in the Gulf of Terranova a few miles off the northeast coast of Sardinia.
The species is extinct and it gives me pleasure to name it in honor of the wellknown paleontologist John Eyerman Esq. of Easton Pennsylvania in whose collection the specimens at the present writing belong.
The specimen marked No.
12 represents the upper part of the right tibiotarsus of a bird of some considerable size see fig.
1 of the text.
Its procneniial process is slightly broken away above and the free margin of the summit of tlie bone behind is also chipped away.
We have in the National Museum a great number of specimens of the fossil bones of birds received several years ago from Professor Alf.
MilneEdwards and among these numerous examples of the long bones of Palceolodus crassipes P. amhiguus and others of the genus but this bone did not belong to a Palceolodus.
Upon comparing with such material as I had of Pelecanns gracilis it was quickly seen that it never came from a Pelican and the fact was further confirmed by carefully comparing it with the tibiotarsi of numerous species of existing forms of that group.
In short it has been compared by me with every figure of the larger birds where 1896.
513 the tibio tarsus has been figured in all the works at hand as well as with the tibiotarsi of representative groups of existing types.
By differential diagnosis I am satisfied that its owner was a Tantalus and that too very near Tantalus loculator.
Moreover it was a T'aito.sof almost precisely the same size as T. loculator and its ti biotarsus presents characters agreeing very closely with that species.
The agreement is so close that it would appear unnecessary to remove it from that genus I therefore propose the following  Tantalus milneedwardsii n. sp.
Based upon the upper part of the right tibiotarsus nearly complete.
Characters as in Tantalus loculator to which latter species the present one must have been closely related.
This species I name in honor of the very distinguished French savant Professor Alphonse MilueEdwards Fig.

13 the lower half of a bird's tarsometatarsus from the right pelvic limb evidently belonged to some adult medium sized species of a falconine form probably now extinct.
As I have not the proper material in sufficient quantity to compare this specimen with I do not feel warranted in naming it.
 After this drawing was made two other small fragments were found that when placed in .situ simply completed the distal broken part of this fragment.
 In comparing this bone the following works and the plates and figures thereto were also examined.

To be named with certainty No.
15 is also too fragmentary while the remarks about specimen No 15 apply with equal truth to No.

In specimen No.
18 we have the fragments of the upper twothirds of the right tarsometatarsus probably of some small passerine bird which my meagre material for comparison will not admit of my identifying.
On this bone the hypofai'sus is short being composed of two lateral portions enclosing a tendinal foraminal canal between them.
Both of these lateral portions are distinctly grooved in the vertical direction upon their posterior aspects by tendinal channels.
To identify such a minute fragmentary specimen as this one should have before him for comparison the skeletons of a representative series of the small birds of France in its existing avifauna as well as access to such fossil forms as have been discovered or described up to date.
To appreciate the difficulty of diagnosis of this nature one has but to make the trial to distinguish the complete skeleton of any one of our American Warblers from those of its near allies in other genera and my meaning will be made clear.
How much more difficult is it then to name with any hope whatever of being near the truth the bits of bones of birds of no greater size that existed in a former geologic age of the earth.
With skulls sterna pelvis and perfect bones all absent this really becomes impossible  absolutely so in the absence of the material above indicated.
These remarks apply with equal truth to specimens Nos.

The first I take to have belonged to an individual of the extinct species Larus totanoides and the other to the somewhat smaller species Larus elegans both of MilneEdwards.'
I am the more convinced of this inasmuch as I have compared them at least in the case of Larus elegans with a number of the fossil tarsometatarsi of that extinct form in the palseontological collections of the U. S. National Museum and the agreement is altogether too close to admit of any doubt.

MAMMALS COLLECTED BY DR. A. DONALDSON SMITH DURING HIS expedition to lake rudolf africa.
i By Samuel N. Rhoads.
In the following annotated list of the mammals collected by Dr. A. Donaldson Smith during his African expedition of 189495 across Somaliland to Lake Rudolf I have included all the species coming under my observation which were brought back by Dr. Smith to Philadelphia.
The greater part of the collection was most generously given to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia but a large part of the skulls mounted heads and skins of the larger game have been reserved by Dr. Smith and at present form an exhibition at the University of Pennsylvania.
Those species in the list not represented in the donation to the Academy are preceded by an asterisk.
The entire collection represents 50 genera and 77 species seven of which are here described as new.
Dr. Smith is to be congratulated on having brought to Philadelphia by far the largest most comprehensive and best preserved faunal collection of African mammals ever acquired by an American institution and not only many species but several genera are for the first time made accessible to students on this side of the Atlantic.
Owing to the almost total lack of specimens in this country for comparison and the widely scattered literature relating to African mammalogy the author has been severely handicapped in his study of the collection and it is hoped that the paper as now presented will be judged accordingly.
1 At the request of Dr. Smith this paper was originally prepared for publication in his forthcoming book on the Lake Rudolf expedition.
Less than three months were alloted the writer for its preparation.
The mss.
was subsequently returned with other papers of scientific character intended for the work on account of lack of space and was then accepted for publication in the Proceeoings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
This includes four genera and live species of bats which have been worked up by Dr Harrison Allen in a separate paper viz  Megaderma frons Megderma cor Nycteris capensis Scotophilus miaiinus and Adelonyderis sp.

It exhibits the peculiarities defined by Mr. Thomas' for the northern form.
The application to this form of the name cethiopica of Sundevall is however incorrect as the camelopardalis of Linnaeus is assigned by that author to  Ethiopia and Sennar.
 This makes Sundevall's name a synonym the southern race remaining so far as I can ascertain unnamed.
I would propose for the latter the name Giraffa camelopardalis australis Nom.

A remarkably large skull was added to the already fine collection of zebra crania in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
Its greatest length from the anterior edge of the premaxillary to the superior rim of the occiput measured in a straight line is 633 mm.
Its greatest zygomatic width is 220 mm.
The alveolar length of the upper molar series is 170 mm. and the greatest length of mandible is 507 mm.
The specimen is of an old male and compared with a skull of E. hurchelli of same age is 100 mm.
longer and is nearly 50 mm.
longer than the largest skull of E. caballus in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
Compared with that of hurchelli the skull of grevyi is remarkably long for its width due to the great relative prohngation of the rostral and occipital regions.
In hurchelli the length of skull is 2.63 times the width in grevyi it is nearly three 2.88 times the width.
The lower molar series differ markedly from hurchelli in their uniformly massive size and great width the same series in btirchelli becoming much narrowed posteriorly.

It may be characterized as follows  Colors  Upper head back and the slender tail dull black grizzled with tawny brown  half the hairs of back wholly black the remainder blackbased with light brown ring and black tip.
Brownringed hairs more numerous on sides giving a lighter shade to those parts.
Upper and lower sides of tail colored alike blacker toward distal end  hairs at base black with one to three light brown rings terminal hairs longer and blacker with now and then a subterminal brown ring.
Upper feet and scrotum rusty haired.
Whisker patch cheeks line around eyes chin throat breast inside of legs and a narrow abdominal line dirty tawny white or fawn.

This squirrel apparently comes nearest S. poensis A. Smith but it lacks any trace of greenish color is smaller and the tail and body are of equal lengths.
Like poensis the five upper molars on each side are well developed and permanent.
It appears too small and dark for S. cepapi A. Smith.
With any of the recently described species it seems to have no close affinities24.

Fur soft and rather short.
Above uniform tawny ochre faintly grizzled with black  below tawny white.
Upper tail colored like back lower tail with broad mesial stripe of clear rusty ochre.
The dorsal hairs are blackbased and blacktipped with a subterminal ring of ochre as are also those of the upper head.
On the sides the hairs are black at base with long ochre tips and on the limbs and feet and sides of neck the ochre almost obscures externally the darker basal color.
The tawny white hairs of lips cliiu throat breast abdomen and inner legs are unicolor to their bases.
The region just above and below eyes is of the same color.
The whiskers reach to tip of recumbent ears and are sparse and black.
The hairs of upper tail are ochre and black ringed by four to six alternating zones of equal width the basal one being ochre the minute terminal one black.
The lower mesial tail hairs appear to be uniform rusty ochre but a glass reveals a narrow subterminal black ring.
The outer border and tip of lower side of tail is like the upper side.
The skull is remarkably narrow and deep for its length the postorbital process very short and blunt the braincase highly and narrowly arched and the audital bulla
widely separated from the pterygoid processes owing to the strong indented constriction of the inner anterior border of the bullre.
The auditory meatus is also oom pressed within the outer lateral plane of the overhanging squamosal.

One specimen a skin of an old female with skull in good condition represents this distinctly marked little squirrel.
So far as I am able to distinguish it differs in size color and cranial characters from any described species.
Its relationships are with S. cepapi but its smaller size light color and high narrow brain case with long compressed zygorase separate them.

3806 taken August 29 1894 at Shebeli the cinnamon of sides is almost obscured by the white hair tips the back is clear blackgrizzled fawn and the hind head and limbs like sides.
The tail in this specimen has quite recently molted and is a beautiful black above broadly margined and tipped with glistening white.
Below there is a mesial stripe of fleshy brown bordered with black and the latter is fringed with white as above.
In a very old male taken March 231895 the back and hind bead are much blacker and the forehead sides and limbs nearly chestnutred  the whisker patch throat and sides of head neck and a narrow lateral marginal line fulvous.
The tail is in the molt to the black and white pelage and the old pelage is much darker brownblack than in the other specimens and lacks any sign of the mesial band.
Two quartergrown young male and female in alcohol are colored like the adults on head and forelimbs the rest of the body above is sandybrown the outer tail hairs are dull white the upper vertebral line of tail showing short black and rusty hairs.
The tail without hairs is about the length of body without head.
Its tip is blunt and the whole organ viewed from above is remarkably triangular measuring across base in the spirit specimen about 30 mm.
and tapering evenly to the point.
The tail is much flattened and a strongly depressed vertebral line above and below separates the thickened rounded fleshy sides.

The basal fifth of these hairs is black.
followed by a similar length of white then a much longer subterminal one of black the tip being white.
The same style of pelt and coloration is found on the sides tail belly and legs except that the bristling hairs become fewer almost disappearing on the shoulders and sides of neck and becoming obsolete on the underparts.
The tail is unicolor except a short white tip.
There is a welldefined occipital band of black between the anterior bases of ears forming a Vshaped extension into the middle of the white crown patch and connecting across the anterior base of ear with the black area of cheeks nose lower head and supraorbital stripe.
There is a faint isolated patch of white half way up between the eye and the mouth and a conspicuous patch of the same in front of and below each ear.
The feet are sparsely clothed with coarse black hair becoming bristly on the toes and exceeding them in length.
The whiskers reach almost to shoulders and are wholly jetblack.
The backs of ears are very sparsely clothed with short brownish and white hairs but their margins and inner surfaces are thickly set with bristly white hairs 3 to 5 mm.
long.
The lateral band of short spinuous hairs which divides the dorsal from the costal mane areas begins broadly and sharply at the base of the neck on a line with the ear and terminates indefinitely near the sacrum in a slender point of hairs.
The larger of the hairs measure about 20 mm.

Dr. Smith's specimen appears to be the fifth.
It is certainly the first to reach an American museum.
Compared with MilneEdwards' illustrations' of the type of imhausi the Smith specimen is somewhat younger and smaller with much shorter tail though fully adult.
The pelage is more worn or naturally shorter than in the type and consequently is appreciably lighter colored throughout owing to the more exposed bases of the fur.
The tail almost wholly lacks the white tip and the head the small white patch under eye of imhausi.
The most marked color difference in the Sheikh Huseiu example is seen in the division of the white of upper head by a distinct black band joining the dark area of occiput with that of the side of head Zool.

There is a large white spot 25 mm.

Cranially the Smith specimen differs specifically in its narrow interorbital width the less produced expansion of the occipital region beyond posterior line of the interparietal and the almost complete suppression of the forward extension of the squamosal.

long.
The dentition of smithi making allowance for the difference in age appears to be almost identical with Edwards' figures of imhausi except that the posterior upper molar lies wholly outside the median longitudinal axis of the anterior molars.
In the latter the nasals are broader posteriorly than anteriorly these proportions being reversed in smithi.
In imhausi the postpalatal notch is opposite anterior base of posterior molar  in smithi it only reaches the middle of that tooth.
The paroccipital processes in smithi are directed forward against the audital bullse  in imhausi they are directed backward and separated from the bullse by a distinct space.
The mandible of smithi while exactly the same length as that of imhausi is very much more slender the greatest breadth of the latter being 4 mm.

The three recorded specimens' all came from a tract on the Red Sea north of the 15th parallel  smithi was taken on a mountain 5000 feet high in the Indian Oceandrainage about 700 miles southeast of the most southern recorded locality of an imhausi specimen.
For an account of the capture of the specimen and of the nature of its habitat the reader is referred to Dr. Smith's narrative.

It is possible that the dark specimen only is referable to Peters's species and the others to some andescribed form.

Ouly one specimen of this genus is in the collection.
It is an adult female with teeth well worn and showing plainly three pairs of teats pectoral abdominal and inguinal.
The specimen is in spirit.
It differs decidedly from S. pratensis and S. krebsi as figured and described in Peters' work on the mammals of Mozambique in its diminutive size.
Its tail is also relatively much shorter and the ears smaller than in either of these species.
Its colors resemble those given in Peters' plate I. e. of  edulis but lack the fawn tint of that species.

Tail well haired slender nearly equal to length of head and body.
Ears small rounded and thickly haired  pelage dense slightly hispid tricolor.
Color above dark blackbrown becoming dark fulvous brown on sides and lower cheeks.
Lower parts grayishwhite tinged with fulvous on breast neck and throat.

Two specimens of this minute mouse both males taken at Sheikh Mahomet appear to be undescribed.
In some respects they resemble the characters given by Riippell for Mus iniberbis but they are much smaller with relatively longer tails and have well developed whiskers.
The socalled whiskerless character of Riippell's animal appears to me to be an anomaly due to abnormal rather than natural circumstances.
In any event this question in no wise affects the status of the mouse which owes to an accident of birth and locality rather than to its possession of whiskers the august specific name which I have imposed upon it.

in alcohol from River Darde September 12 1894 are of interest.
Mr. Oldfield Thomas considers M. arborarius of Peters synonymous with M. dolichurus.
If this is the case the River Darde mice are perhaps a good subspecies characterized by the excessively long tail and smaller size.
In our oldest specimen No.
3847 with molars more worn than in the adult type skull of arborarius figured by Peters the skull is markedly smaller and shallower.
After examining their descriptions it seems to me that Peters has plainly set forth good distinctions between his arborarius and Smuts' dolichurus.
The most marked character of arborarius is the jDure white feet and belly which in dolichurus are fulvous.
The absence of a preocular spot in arborarius is also to be considered.
In these respects the Smith specimens resemble arborarius.
The feet and under parts are immaculate white to the roots of the hairs.
In the adult the total length is 100 mm. that of the tail vertebrae being 150 mm.
In the younger one contrary to the general rule in young murines the proportional size of tail to head and body is even greater than in the adult the former being 122 mm.

In the type of dolichurus the length of head and body is 125 mm.

These figures combined with the color ditferences convince me of the proprietv of sepurating arborarius
from dolicJiurus and at the same time classing the Kiver Darde specimens with the former species.
The character of the tail in the alcoholic specimen seems to indicate clearly its use as a prehensile organ.

The skull compared with Peters' illustration .
c differs in the shape of the pterygoid fossa which in our examples is widest at the postpalatal notch and contracts at the pterygoid processes widening again in a vaseshaped outline as viewed from above.
The semispinous character of the pelage in this species is intermediate between that of Mus and Acomys.

Golunda reichardi Xoack.
Reichard's Bush Rat.
Six fine skins and one specimen in alcohol of a  grass or bush rat were taken at Sheikh Mahomet.
They answer Noack's description of reichardi' as contrasted with that of Peters for  PeJomys fallax so well that I cannot hesitate to assign them to the former and confirm the correctness of Noack's separation of the two.
The entire absence of a sulcus from the incisors of any of our specimens instantly distinguishes them from fallax.
The black dorsal streak is plain in some in others nearly absent.
The general body color may be said to be ochraceous to tawny brown grizzled coarsely with black.
Sides of nose and eyering pure ochraceous.
A note on one of the labels states this rat  makes a prehensile sic nest in bush  habitat in thick grass.

3853 is a finely prepared skin with skull and field measurements taken by the collector.
The two adults correspond so exactly with Smith's beautiful plate of D. typicus in both color and dimensions I am unable to note any differences of even subspecific value.
The fact that typicus is a South African species would lead to the supposition that the Galla animal diflfered therefrom.
In the absence of specimens for comparison these will be classed under mesomelas Wagner Heuglin and Trouessart agreeing that typicus is a synonym of that species.
Matschie names the longtailed Dendromys of East Africa D.piimilio Wagner quoting  Munch gel.
Anz. XII 1820 p.

I am unable to find this publication but would suppose some mistake as Wagner states three times in his description of piimilio in Weigmanu's Archiv.
fur Naturgesehichte 1841 p. 135 that it is a new species no reference being made to a previous description.
The chief distinction between jyumilio and mesomelas if any Trouessart and Heuglin considering them the same is the absence of the dark dorsal stripe in the former.
From D. mystacalis Heugl.' of Abyssinia the Sheikh Mahomet specimens are distinguished by greater size relatively longer and less hairy tail and the presence of the dark dorsal stripe.

So desperately involved is the nomenclature and classification of the numerous African members of this genus I hesitate to impose a name on what appears to me an undescribed form No.
3857 Ad.
9  from Hargesa taken July 18 1894.
While resembling in general characters of skull and skin Peters' leucogaster it is essentially different from any Gerbillus I have examined in the entire absence of the posterior cusp of m3  that tooth consisting merely of the normal semicircular loop with anterior curve and single posterior crenation.
The tooth is not much worn so that any trace of the posterior cusp would be easily distinguished neither is there the faintest indication of it at the base of the tooth the posterior crenation nearly reaching the alveolus.
The specimen is a dry skin  the upper body colors are a rich dark fawn becoming tawny along sides and lined along upper back and head with coarse blacktipped hairs.
The ears and upper tail are blackishfawn the latter becoming nearly black toward tip and ochraceous white on the lower side.
The feet and under side of body including lower cheeks and upper lips white to the bases of hairs.
Shorter whiskers white longer ones blackish.
Bases of upper body hairs light slate.
The measurement of the dry skin gives the total length 280 mm.

The skull is 60 mm.
long and 20 wide the nasals 16 long and very slender the supraorbital bead very strong and with an anterior flange.

3926 3925 also in spirit and another immature specimen a skin with skull No.
3856 fully represent a species which was collected on the route to and from Lake Rudolf between June 2d and August 5 1895.
The more pallid pelage of the dry skin would indicate it either to be a desert race of the type or that the specimens in alcohol of same age have become darkened by their immersion.
In either case the species is lighter colored than any other in the collection.
I have ventured its sepai'ation because of the remarkable and apparently unique character of the hairysoled feet.
This is quite as marked in the old as in the young.
These sole hairs form a sort of cusliion on and just behind the anterior tuberculated part of the bind and fore feet and even the plantar excrescence of the heel is furnished with scattering bristling hairs.
The toes are almost as fully haired beneath as above.
The character of the tuberculation of iiJj as above given is also strongly diagnostic.

Otomys irroratus Brants.
Brants' Otomys.
A young specimen labeled from Sheikh Mahomet was brought back in alcohol.

It is light brown darkly grizzled with black the tail deep black above its underside being grayish.
The hind feet are black with brownish hairs along the outside near heel.
The upper incisors have two distinct median and inner anterior grooves and a slightly concave flattening of the convex intervening space.
The lower incisors present one deep groove dividing the face of the tooth into an outer third and an inner twothirds  along the inner edge of the tooth face is a faint sulcus and the intervening convexity is faintly flattened medially.
Owing to the immaturity of the tooth these sulcations are less strongly developed than would ensue with greater age the fainter grooves only appearing at the alveolar surface.

Acad.
Berl. 1878 p. 201. rodents brought back by Dr. Smith.
It was taken at Milmil Somaliland July 24 1894.
It appears to be the third recorded specimen in existence and the second belonging to the type species of this remarkable genus.
Riippell's type of glaher came from Shoa and was described in 1845.
It now exists in the Senckenburg Museum in the form of a mounted skin with the skull separate the mandibles missing.
In 1885 E. Lort Phillips sent another specimen of Heterocephalus inspirits to the British Museum from Central Somaliland.
This was made the subject of a communication by Mr. Old field Thomas before the London Zoological Society and in the Proceedings of that Society was described as new under the uame pJiillipsi after its discoverer.
Subsequently Mr. Thomas publi.shed' a more complete account and description with figures of the new animaU and made detailed comparisons with glaher.
It was with no small curiosity that after having a photograph made of Dr. Smith's specimen I removed the skull and compared it with the figures of Riippell and Thomas.
Except in its greater age and size there are no diflerences between the animal from Milmil and the Shoa type.
The color of the skin is pale ochraceous with a fleshy tinge becoming pale livid on the upper sides of head neck belly rump and tail.
The scattered hairs are a silvery transparent white.
The underparts are somewhat lighter than the upper.
The skin of head is very thick and tough more so for example than that of the oldest and toughest Mas decumanus that I ever dissected.
The inner finger of manus is much shorter relatively than figured by Thomas for phillipsi.
Two mammae 15 mm.
apart are faintly indicated at the sternum immediately between the fore legs when they are drawn down at right angles to the body.
A series of seven pairs of teatlike excrescences each bearing in its pitted center a bristling hair 5 mm.
long extend along the sides to the groin in the position of the regular teat series.
The  wrinkled warty appearance of the skin which Mr. Thomas thinks may be due to the action of spirits on the specimen of phillipsi I am confident is perfectly normal as our specimen plainly indicates in many ways and it will be seen that these pits warts and furrows are closely correlated with the anatomy of the animal  Abhand.

' The skull of the Milrail animal is from H to 2 mm.
larger in its exterior dimensions than that of the type o glaber.
It belongs to a much older animal and on this account the differences in dimensions and formation of the teeth are perhaps largely attributable.
Among these the most noticeable are found 1st in the upper incisors each bearing upon their inner anterior surftices a distinct shallow sulcus bordered on the inner side by a sharp ridge and merging outwardly into the convexity of the lateral twothirds of the face of tooth.
Riippell states clearly that his animal had unchanneled incisors  Thomas says the incisors of phillipsi are  somewhat flattened and bevelled on their interior halves but does not define a sulcus.
The upper molars of the specimen in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia number six as in glaber.
Unlike those figured fur glaher their crown surfaces are of unequal dimensions m2 being onethird larger than m1 and m3 considerably smaller than m .
In the two first upper molars the crowns have worn down until the enamel folds are obliterated.
In the last which evidently erupted at a much later date than the anterior pair the crown shows a trifoliate surface due to the impinging of the enamel walls of the lateral and posterior sides of the tooth nearly to its center.
Of the three mandibular molars m72 and m. 3 are about equal in size m. 1 being about half as large  the latter is circular in outline and shows no enamel folding  in m72 there is a pretty deep indentation on the outer wall and a shallow curve of the inner  in m. 3 these indentations are exaggerated nearly equal and nearly divide the tooth into two sections the anterior section being rectangular the posterior hemispherical in outline.
If we were to apply the standard of specific separation generally recognized today as governing the classification of rodents it would be consistent perhaps to make tlie third specimen of Heterocephalus a third species on the dental characters above defined and on similar grounds establish a new genus for the lightmolared H. phillipsi but I fully agree with Mr. Thomas that the known individual variations in other species of the Bathyergincd are quite as marked as any yet attributed to Heterocephalus.
 A plate of the specimen is being prepared for Dr. Smith's book on the Expedition.

3815 3816 the latter from Hargesa July 21 1894 the former taken March 3 1895 are similar in their deep chocolate tints as comjjared with Peters' plate and Thomas'' diagnosis of the typical form.
The young animal is grayer and more tawny than the adult above but the lower parts of the two are very similar.

Herpestes gracilis ochraceus Gray.
Abyssinian Mongoose.
The skin and skull of an old male Herpestes No.

Compared with Gray's plate of ochraceus the Smith specimen is redder and more darkly annulated with black.
The form and color pattern of the tail is very similar to Gray's in our specimen except that the slender portion adjoining the black tip is bright rusty.
The black tip is about 35 mm.
long.

  collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
Collected by Dr. A. Donaldson Smith at Ngare Nocbor Lake Eudolf Africa August 26 1895.
Description  Similar to E. albiventris Wagner as defined by Dobson but with hoary black limbs feet tail ears and facepatch the remaining pelage pure clear white.
Extreme tips of spines sooty black.
Color  Spinous region covered evenly with spines 20 mm.
long whose extreme tips are dusky followed by a subapical zone of dull white 5 mm.
wide then by a hornblack zone 8 mm.
wide fading into a lighter zone and darkening again into a black base.
Facial area bounded by edges of upper lips and lines drawn from corners of mouth to eyes and thence connecting across forehead thinlyhaired anteriorly by sooty black more thickly and lengthily haired posteriorly and with a decided moustache below eye across cheeks of pure black.
A triangular spot of black on lower lips and chin to corners of mouth.
Region between dark facial patch and spines of hindhead and ears cheeks throat breast belly and sides nearly to ventral region pure silky white with an occasional black hair.
Forelegs from body to feet black well intermixed with white especially on inner side of arm.
Forefeet and soles black with a few gray hairs.
Hindlimbs and feet colored like forelimbs with a decided whitish patch on inner side of pes near heel.
Tail and vent hoary black.
Formation of feet as is minutely described by Dobson for albiventris I. c.
The rounded thicklyhaired ears grayish sooty black inside and out.
Measurements of type by collector in field  Total length 118 mm.
 tail vertebra 10 hindfoot 23  ear from crown dry 13.5.
31 Monog.
Insectiv. 1882 p. 11.
Skull total length 35  zygomatic breadth 22 interorbital constriction 10.6 length of nasals 11.8 length of mandible 27 breadth of mandible 12.
The immaturity of the specimen which I have made to represent this newlydescribed race of albiventris can in nowise account for its color characters as contrasted with the typical form whose habitat Dobson places as  northern tropical Africa.
In ajpearance as well as in habitat this race may be said to show some approach to the South African E. diadematus Fitz. but closer examination shows its affinities to be with the northern animal.
The single skin and skull brought back by Dr. Smith indicate an individual closely approaching maturity the posterior molar and the canine just cutting through the gums.
67.
Macroscelides rufescens Peters.
Rufescent Jumping Shrew.
This shrew whose cranial characters so closely ally it to M. intufi Smith is represented by an adult female and an immature male Nos.
3829 3830 taken respectively at Ehrer and Lanimo on the 12th and 16th of August 1894.
The adult is somewhat blacker and less ruddy than Peters' specimens but the measurements and color pattern are identical.
Both specimens are skins with skulls full data and measurements.
68.
Macroscelides sp.

A half grown individual No.
3828 labeled Waleuso October 26 1894 is so dark and has such a short tail compared with body that it is probably distinct.
Its skull however shows near relationship to rufescens.
It is preserved in alcohol.
69.
Crocidura doriana Dobson.
Shoa Shrew.
An alcoholic specimen of an adult shrew No.
3826 in the collection was taken at Sheikh Mahomet October 28 1894.
The skull and dentition are identical with Dobson's Shoa species as figured in the Monograph.
70.
Crocidura sp.

A rather young example No.
3827 in alcohol from Lake Rudolf the skull of which unfortunately was lost after being extracted for examination is of interest.
The skin and sparse hairs of tail and feet are white.
Tail about half the length of head and body.
Color of body dark bluishgray lighter beneath.
Total length about 100 mm. hindfoot 12.5.
Ears conspicuous.
The small size of this specimen makes it improbable that it is C. leucura Matschie its immaturity not being sufficient to account for the different measurements.

 THE HYMENOPTERA COLLECTED BY DR. A. DONALDSON SMITH IN NORTHEAST AFRICA.
BY WILLIAM J.
FOX.
The following list includes only the Aculeate Hymenoptera brought home by Dr. Smith.
The collection includes besides these perhaps thirty species of ants and parasitic forms which I am obliged to pass unnoticed for the present.
Inasmuch as I have had to rely entirely on descriptions in classifying the collection I beg to offer that fact as an apology for any erroneous identifications that may have been made.
The specimens were collected on a journey from Berbera through Somaliland to Lake Rudolf thence to a point on the east coast and with many other specimens have been presented to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia by Dr. Smith.
