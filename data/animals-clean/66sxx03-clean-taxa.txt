FISHES COLLECTED BY THE PEARY RELIEF EXPEDITION OF 1899.
BY HENRY W. FOWLER.
Mr. C. F. Silvester kindly placed this collection of fishes in my hands for determination.
In some cases the specimens represent localities not given by previous writers.
Two species are apparently new.
The collection is small though fairly representative of the meagre fishfauna of such high latitudes in Greenland.
At present it is contained in the Museum of Princeton University with the exception of a series of duplicates presented to the Academy.
The writer is indebted to Princeton University and to Mr. Silvester for assistance and favors in framing the report.

II.
BY JAMES A. G. REHN AND MORGAN HEBARD.
During the month of July 1912 the authors undertook a careful field examination of the Florida Keys and the adjacent mainland in order to complete their studies in the Orthoptera of the subtropical area of southern Florida.
Material procured by field work undertaken by the junior author in January and February 1903 and 1904 and in March 1910 as well as small collections made at Miami during the summer of 1903 and at that locality and Key West in November 1911 have already been studied. The supplementary results obtained from the present collection when compared with the material of the two previous papers noted above afford a very complete knowledge of all but the scarcest species of the Orthoptera of this region.
A number of species of tropical origin are there so scarce and so difficult to find that our knowledge of them is based on the single or very few specimens taken such species can only be fully studied by a resident or through definite search for these forms alone.
We feel satisfied however that the present paper gives the final results of a very careful general examination of the region under consideration.
The recent summer work indicates several important facts.
The families Mantidse Acrididse and Tettigoniidae are shown to be severely affected in winter by the cold the Acrididse the least of the three families.
Almost all of the fairly plentiful or abundant species  are to be found in greatly increased numbers in the summer but the scarce or very rare species are in the great majority of cases quite as difficult to find in the summer as during the winter.
Certain species particularly some of those belonging to the Acrididse and Tettigoniidae which are numerous or very abundant during the summer are wholly absent in the winter.
The following tablewill indicate the comparative abundance of forms as found in midsummer.

Three of these nine species are known only from the keys five from the keys and the junglelike hammock land of the subtropical region of Florida and one from the latter only.
This evidence shows that half of the tropical species which have become permanently fixed in this region were in all probability accidentally introduced by man and that outside of these species the tropical element is very weak equalling but 11.3 of the nonintroduced species and only found in the scrub of the keys and the limited areas of junglelike hammock land on the southernmost portion of the Florida peninsula distinguished particularly by the presence of the gumbo limbo Bursera simarubra.
Of these species the genus Mantoida is tropical American while Oligacanthopus is known only from a single specimen from Miami Fla. All of the other species are West Indian Plectoptera poeyi Stilp7iochlora marginella and Cyrtoxipha gundlachi being found elsewhere in tropical America as well.

Pine trees are found only on Big Pine and the adjacent keys and in the undergrowth of these forests three species Radinotatum hrevipenne peninsulare Schistocerca damnifica calidior and Aptenopedes aptera were found which species were not present elsewhere on the keys.
In this situation the resemblance of specimens of a number of species to mainland individuals of the same was closer than to those taken in the keys scrub the latter series as a rule differing in paler coloration.

After dark the insects would appear in numbers accompanied by swarms of Periplaneta americana but the series was secured with difficulty as the insects were very active and invariablj scuttled awaj into cracks in the walls and tallies at the first approach of a light.
Individuals were greasy and unclean.
Caudell has recently placed Scudder's Labia hrunnea correctly in the synonymy under the present species.
Though this species has been found introduced in the United  The species Labia curvicauda which was found so plentiful in March 1910 on Long Kej' was not seen in the summer of 1912.
PeeuHar conditions following the hurricane of 1909 afforded the opportunity to take the series on the earlier date and had dying tops of cocoanut palms been present in the summer of 1912 there is little doubt but that the species would have been then found abundant.

This individual the first United States record of this circumtropical species was taken in a very greasy cupboard in the Hotel Jefferson in company with swarms of Blattella germanica and a few specimens of Supella supellectilium.
The much paler coloration made this specimen the only one of the species seen very conspicuous among the many other darker roaches disclosed by the light of a flashlamp.
We follow Saussure in placing this species in the genus Ischnoptera.
It is the only species of that genus found within the United States which has the ventrocephalic margin of the cephalic femora armed with a complete row of spines the more distal shorter than the more proximal.
All of the other North American species of Ischnoptera have this margin armed with 3 to 5 strong spines succeeded distad by a closeset row of minute piliform spinulations.

The series was taken in a fruit store where the species was common in a pile of old burlap bags and in cracks under the stands which it shared with one fairly large colony of BlatteUa germanica occasional specimens of Holocompsa nitidula a few specimens of Periplaneta americana and one specimen of Supella supelledilium.
The present species was previously known from the United States from a single female taken on Key Largo Fla. A single female was captured which had just moulted into the adult condition this specimen was uniform pale straw color.
Nymphs of this species are above bay in coloration below more tawny especially on the limbs while that portion of the head from the interantennal space to the clypeal suture is very dark the entire dorsal surface of these nymphs is rough much as are the distal abdominal segments in nymphs of Pycnoscelus surinamensis.

This great insect is widely distributed and well known to the natives about Key West where it is found in wood piles under boards and other refuse about the town.
The insects when exposed either remained motionless or scuttled toward another place of concealment with no great speed.
The nymphs were usually found half buried in loose damp earth under boards where they remained motionless looking much like lumps of earth with which they were usually much dusted until disturbed.
Two very small nymphs were observed which had recently moulted these individuals were pure white and very soft.

These diminutive roaches were found in the folds of burlap bags under the counter of a fruit store where other interesting roaches were taken and also with Blaberus atropos between old boards in a wood shed where nymphs were more numerous than adults.
The insects when disturbed ran about with great speed but did not go far to hide often stopping in the first bits of refuse to which they came.

The present series enables us to synonymize Burmeister's Holocompsa cyanea which was based upon males of the species while his Holocampsa collar is was described from individuals of the opposite sex.
The latter species was first recognized as a synonym of Holocompsa nitidula by Kirby in 1904.
 Previous authors have failed to recognize cyanea and collaris as sexes of the same species owing apparently to their lack of sufficient material.
The males are rather slender and almost uniformly shining blackish the antennse have three pale yellowish joints in the distal portion and the limbs are very dark brown while the females are much more robust the pronotum is strikingly cinnamonrufous and the tegmina are a very dark metallic blue in the colored portion in the latter sex somewhat more than the distal half of the antennae is pale yellowish.
Such striking differences between the sexes explains their being described as different species in the same paper.

The coloration of Ijoth sexes shows no decided variations.
Specimens from more northern localities in the range of the species apparently average smaller than individuals from the keys judging from a male from Tarpon Springs Fla. and two females from Fort George Fla. and Thomasville Ga.
The present specimens were taken chiefly from gumbolimbo trees in the heavy key scrub jungle but the species also occurred on sea grape.
The insects were always on the trunks or branches and generally about six feet from the ground infrequently higher and very rarely lower.
They were perfectly protected when in their resting position being then closely pressed against the bark of the tree.
When disturbed they would make off with a rapid scuttling run.

' On careful examination of our Florida series of twenty adults of this genus two species were found to be present distinguishable by very good characters in the male and female genitalia and also in the distal abdominal segments.
The original description and figure of tenuescens show conclusively that the form with the elongate subcylindrical anal segment in the male is that species.
The two species of Manomera were taken together in the same situations on prairie in undergrowth of pine woods and at night on the extremities of the leaves of the saw palmetto Serenoa at Homestead and in pine woods undergrowth on the edge of a hammock at Detroit.

Closely allied to M. tenuescens Scudder agreeing in general form structure of the limbs and coloration but differing in the much more abbreviate seventh eighth and ninth abdominal segments and the form of the apex of the male abdomen.
In the male the seventh eighth and ninth dorsal abdominal segments together are hardly or not at all longer than the sixth dorsal segment while in tenuescens they are half again as long the eighth dorsal segment in brachypyga is transverse instead of longitudinal the ninth segment fornicate and subinflated instead of decidedly longitudinal and cylindrical as in tenuescens while the cerci of tenuescens have a delicate spine at the internal base which is represented in brachypyga by a much more robust tooth.
The two forms can be very readily separated when the apex of the male abdomen is viewed from either the dorsal or lateral aspect.
In the female the sixth dorsal abdominal segment is considerably longer than the seventh and eighth segments while in tenuescens it is less than the seventh and eighth segments in length the ninth segment is equal in length to the prothorax which 19U.

The present authors have recorded a male of this species taken at San Pablo Fla. August 13 1905 as M. tenuescens at that writing not recognizing it as distinct from individuals of that species in the same series.
A series of one adult female and eleven nymphs taken at Miami Fla. March 28 1910 have also been recorded as that species.
The abovemeasured five males and one female constitute the known series of adult specimens of brachypyga the San Pablo specimen showing that there is considerable variation in size regarding which our series is too small for us to say whether it is geographical or individual in character.
We consider the two additional Homestead specimens and the single Detroit individual paratypes.
The differential characters show almost no variation there being but a slight amount of proportional difference in the length of the eighth dorsal segment.
The distal margin of the ninth dorsl abdominal segment varies from arcuatoemarginate to obtuseangulate emarginate.
In coloration the Homestead and Detroit individuals are uniform while the San Pablo specimen is of similar pattern but with the tones paler.
The new form was found on July 1012 1912 under exactly the same conditions at Homestead and Detroit as was tenuescens the San Pablo specimen having been taken in the undergrowth of pine woods Aplopus mayeri Caudell.

A special trip to secure specimens of this striking species was made to Loggerhead Key where with the kind assistance of Dr. Alfred G. flayer the Director of the Carnegie Marine Biological Laboratory we were able to secure the above interesting series.
All were taken from bushes of the bay cedar Suriana maritima to which as shown by Stockard in his paper on the habits of this species  the species is there restricted.
The adult females show the marked color variations spoken of by Stockard while the males vary only in the extent to which the greenish of the limbs tinges the thoracic segments.
Our series shows the following extremes in the length of the body cf 83.93.

According to Dr. Iayer the species occurs on Bird Key and Garden Key the other islands of the Tortugas group.
On Long Key the single very immature individual was beaten from heavy key scrub.
The nearly halfgrown male from Key West was found in the afternoon climbing up the trunk of a bush in a heavy tangle.

At Homestead the species was common on the prairielike everglades and also in the ''pot holes in the pine woods but not as numerous as in March 1910.
The specimen from Long Key was beaten from tall grasses in an open depressed area where Mermiria mtertexta was taken.

The extensive Homestead and Detroit series of this race are perfectly typical in character the Big Pine Key representation also having all the distinguishing features of peninsulare although of sliglitlj smaller size.
There is considerable individual variation in size in all three lots the extremes in length of lod of each being as follows Homestead d 32.235.7 9 42.346.7 Detroit c 33.335.2 9 45.248 Big Pine Key c 28.333 9 37.340.8 mm.
It will be seen that the Big Pine Key maximum measurements no more than touch the minimum of the other lots in the male sex and do not reach the same in the female.
The average of the Big Pine Key series is very appreciably less than the maximum dimensions given for the same lot.
The Homestead series has the brown phase predominating while the Detroit and Big Pine Key lots have the green phase outnumbering the brown in the male sex.
At all three localities the form was found common in the low undergrowth in the pine woods.
The record from Big Pine Key is the first for the genus on the keys.
It is doubtless found on all the islands possessing stands of pine and not elsewhere as the distribution of the forms of this genus is limited by this controlling factor.

The present series has been compared with a male from Georgia which is one of Scuclder's types.
In size the present representation shows no noteworthy difference except that the Long Key females are slightly smaller than the other two of that sex.
In color the Homestead and Big Pine Key series are very similar with the pale base color showing no greenish except in the Big Pine Key female.
 The Long Key series on the other hand has the pale base color greenishyellow in the males subochraceous in the females.
The three individuals of the latter sex from Long Key have the discoidal area of the tegmina more or less distinctly maculate superficially somewhat suggesting Bruner's M. maculipennis.
In all of the Big Pine Key males the dark mediolongitudinal line is present on the head and pronotum indicated but incomplete in the accompanying female indicated more or less distinctly in all of the Homestead males and entirely absent in the female indicated on the head and pronotum in four Long Key males on the head and as a lining on the pronotal carina in two males and all three females and present on the head and entirely absent from the pronotum in one male from the same locality.
In two of the seven Big Pine Key nymphs there is no indication of this line and in the others it is only faintly marked.
At Homestead the species was infrequent in high grasses near the edge of the prairielike everglade on Long Key it was not uncommon in places where high grasses grew in an open depressed area while on Big Pine Key it was taken from low plants on the edge of a mangrove swamp where the males were not infrequent the females mostly immature and but two adults of that sex seen.

The present series shows that the measurements previously given by us of specimens from Miami Homestead Long Key Key Vaca and Boot Kcy are probally individual in the main and not geographic.
As there stated however south Florida material is always larger than Thomasville Ga. specimens although occasionally but slightly so.
The Big Pine Key series is quite similar in general size to the individuals previously measured from Boot Key and Key Vaca although a single female is distinctly larger and subequal to the smallest of the Long Key females while one Homestead male is subequal in proportions to the maximum Long Key males.

The material from the keys which have scrub cover Key Biscayne Long Key Key Vaca Boot Key and Key West is all either uniformly colored or of the strongh' bicolored phase i.e. dorsum solidly paler than the lateral aspects while that portion of the material from pine woods Miami Homestead Detroit and Big Pine Key contains thirteen specimens distinctly lined with black on each side of the median carina of the pronotum in a number also distinctly punctulate with dark brownish on the tegmina.
The single nymph from Detroit and one of the four from Homestead have the blackish lineations on the pronotum showing that this coloration is fixed before the adult condition is reached.
At Homestead the species was uncommon in the pine woods nymphs however being abundant while the single nymph from Detroit was in similar surroundings.
In the pine woods on Big Pine Key the species occurred in fair numbers while the Key West female all seen at that locality was taken in the scrub.

None of the Big Pine Key series are in the green phase although five of the seven Key West females and both of the same sex from Homestead are in that phase.
The Garden Key specimen is pale rufeseent but in structure normal for the species.
At Homestead and on Big Pine Key the species occurred in the undergrowth of pine woods on Garden Key it was very common in short grass growing in the enclosure of Fort Jefferson on Long Key it was secured in the depressed grassy area where Mermiria intertexta was also taken and on Key West it was scarce among green herlage and grasses in scattered gumbolimbo forest.
At the latter locality nymphs were numerous.

It is probable that environment is the governing factor in regard to tegminal and wing length in this form.
All of the color phases known for this race are present in the series in hand the only lot very uniformly colored being the male series from Key West which are greenish with the usual postocular bars.
The females from Key West however show three different color phases.
At Key West this form was common in green herbage or grasses in or near a gumbo limbo forest in company with Orphulella pelidna while on Big Pine Key it was taken in pine woods undergrowt.h.

The only situation in which this species was found was on the ground under bushes in high jungle growth of the keys where a few scattered individuals and one small colony was encountered.
The species was very difficult to capture as the brush was too heavy to use a net and the insects flew up hurriedly.
Their flight was observed to be usually low and for short distances.

 The females bear out these facts in like manner.
In the series from Loggerhead Key there are three males remarkable for the fact that the tegmina wholly lack maculations of any kind which gives the insects a very distinctive appearance.
No intermediates between this and the normal color phase were seen but no characters exist to separate the specimens from typical americana the difference being simply due to a loss of a portion of the color pattern through recession.
Though only occasional at the majority of localities this species was very common through the scrub on Key West and quite numerous on Loggerhead Key in open spots where the sandy soil was covered with beach plants grasses and prickly pear.

One male from Homestead is quite brownish two females from the same locality are dull straw colored or washed with brownish while two Detroit females are much tinged on the pronotum and proximad on the tegmina with pale reddishbrown.
A halfgrown nymph from Miami Fla. taken March 28 1910 gives us an idea of the condition of individuals of the species at that time of year.
At Homestead this species occurred locally on the prairielike everglades where they were scarce in the daytime but plentiful at night perched on the grasses stridulating fearlessly.
Their note is an indescribable buzz and click.
The Detroit specimens were taken in pine woods on the edge of a hammock and on Big Pine Key the species was beaten from green bushes in the pine woods.
Two specimens were found dead in spiderwebs at the railroad station at Homestead on July 10.
Amblycorypha uhleri St41.

When compared with Texan material of this species the present series is seen to be identical although the size is much greater than in individuals from New Jersey which however show no specific differences from Texan topotypes.
When careful examination of all the available material has been made it will probably be found that the size regularly decreases northward.
All of the males and several of the females have much of the pronotum pleura and proximal portion of the tegmina more or less ochraceous.
Four of the males have the blackish tympanal maculation decided.
The species was fairly common at Homestead more numerous at night than in the daytime always in the pine woods and in or near largeleaved small bushes of several species.
When search was made for them at night with the aid of a flashlamp they proved to be quite shy flying frequently before their exact location could be ascertained.
Two specimens were taken from spiderwebs on the station building at Homestead July 10.

Marathon Kay Vaca Fla. July 9 1912 1 cT. A comparison of this interesting series the largest known of any single species of the genus with a paratypic male from Punta Gorda kindly presented to us by Mr. Davis shows that while fully in accord in all the important specific characters the Homestead series uniformly differs in having the fastigium shorter though of similar form while the black marking of the clypeal suture is pronounced only in the brown phase and not always present in that condition.
One single green male shows indications of this sutural marking but in the others the face is unicolorous.
The Marathon male has the fastigium more as in the paratype than is true of the Homestead specimens but the apex is even there less elongate than in the Punta Gorda specimens while the clypeal suture has no black.
These differences are probably environmental or geographic but hardly specific in character.
In size there is considerable individual variation the extremes of the Homestead series presenting the measurements in millimeters given below with which are placed those of the Marathon male which appreciably surpasses in build any from the mainland and of the Punta Gorda paratype.

Seven of the Homestead males are in the brown phase all of the remainder in the green phase of coloration.
The brown specimens have the broad dorsal darker bar mentioned by Davis.
At Homestead the species was very common on scrub palmetto Serenoa serrulata in the pine woods rarely on other plants two on sugar cane one on a pine tree and one on a low bush and only found at night when their stridulations permitted stalking with a flashlamp.
The song was faint and ceased on an approach of even as much as twenty feet.
However they were easy to capture when located as they almost invariably made no attempt to escape but instead merely slipped down the palmetto leaf a few inches or around to the other side and there flattened themselves out with caudal limbs extended backward and cephalic limbs forward.
When picked up they would violently attempt to bite their captor and if successful could inflict a painful bite on a tender portion of the hand.
Their jaws are capable of cutting the tough palmetto leaves and in consequence are very powerful.
Their note is very low and consists of a succession of sounds like zipzipzipzipzipzipzipzip.

Key West Fla. July 37 1912 5 d' 1 9 n. At Homestead two perfectly typical males of fuscostriatus were taken in company with typical specimens of mexicanus of which we are thoroughly convinced the former is merely the browncolor phase absolutely no structural differences being found on careful examination.
The song of individuals in the different phases was noted as being the same a krzzzzzkrzzzzzkrzzzzz each preceded when one is near enough to detect it by a sharp buzz.
Individuals were only occasional in the pine woods at Homestead at night and exceedingly shy although permitting a near approach until they ceased singing when however they would dart wildly away.
At Jewfish many were heard singing in high grasses from which one was taken.
All the specimens from Key West were secured in the scrub jungle both in the daytime and at night many nymphs being seen.
As remarked above two individuals from Homestead are in the brown phase all the others being in the green phase.
The specimens in the latter condition show considerable variation in the llackish fastigial marking this varying from the faintest possible median indication to quite a broad solid band crossing the entire fastigium.

After a careful examination of the present specimen the types of Conocephalus hoplomachus and of Conocephalus malivolans Scudder we are convinced that hoplomachus represents the female of malivolans.
The latter was based on a single male from Cedar Keys Fla. which remained unique until the very different female was described by us as C. hoplomachus.
At that time we examined the description of malivolans but the sexual differences are so great that we could not recognize the female then in hand as the other sex of Scudder's species.
The present specimen enables us to establish the above synonymy agreeing as the individual does exactly with the original description and clearly being the male sex of the apparently very different hoplomachus.
The present specimen was taken during the daytime from saw grass growing in kneehigh water on the edge of the everglades.

THE VASCULAR SYSTEM OF THE FLORIDA ALLIGATOR BY ALBERT M. REESE.
The account given by Bronn in his Thierreich is apparently the onh' published description of the circulatory organs in the Crocodilia.
This account even when translated is not very satisfactory especially because it contains no diagrams of the circulation.
It was therefore deemed worth while to work out the circulation in the Florida alligator in order that we might have not only a written description but also a series of more or less accurate diagrams of the veins and arteries.
A number of departures from the description of Bronn were found some of which are noted below.
Most of the work was done upon animals of about 30 inches length which were obtained alive from the Arkansas Alligator Farm at Hot Springs Ark.
The arteries were injected with a colored starch mass by inserting a twoway cannula into the dorsal aorta.
With the blood thus forced into them from the arteries the veins could in most cases be traced without difficulty.
In the diagrams the outlines of the more important organs are accurately shown by dotted lines and the relative diameters of thebloodvessels are shown as accurately as possible by the solid Ijlack lines.
The Heart.
In the Crocodilia as is well known the heart is fourchambered and has about the same general shape as in the higher vertebrates.
The venous blood is emptied into a thinwalled sinus venosus on the dorsal side of the heart by three large vessels and one small one.
The largest of these the postcava empties into the posterior side of the sinus venosus and brings blood from the posterior regions of the body it is quite wide but is exposed for a very short distance between the liver and the heart.
Two large hepatic veins empty into the postcava so near the sinus venosus that they practically have openings into the sinus as is shown in a somewhat exaggerated way in Plate XIII fig.
1.
Near the postcaval and hepatic openings is the distinct coronary vein lying in a slight depression between the right and left ventricles.
From the anterior regions of the body the blood is brought back through two fairly wide but very thinwalled precaval veins which pass across the dorsal surface of the heart to enter the sinus venosus.
The arterial blood is brought from the lungs by two wide thinwalled pulmonary veins Plate XIII fig.
4 v.p.d. v.p.s.
They leave the lungs somewhat caudad to their middle region near the point of entrance of the bronchii and the pulmonary arteries pass mediad in a direction almost at right angles to the long axis of the body and enter the left auricle at the same point.
Blood leaves the heart through five large vessels 1 the pulmonary artery 2 the two aortic arches 3 the right subclavian 4 the primary carotid.
The pulmonary leaves the small right ventricle as a single stem which soon branches into two arteries that pass cephalad and laterad to the lungs along with and close to the main bronchi.
The other arteries that carry blood into the systemic circulation are fused at their base to form a sort of conus arteriosus which may be distended in injected specimen until it is larger than the two ventricles together When opened this conus is found to contain two chambers that lead into the left ventricle the larger chamber gives origin to the right systemic arch the right subclavian and the primary carotid the smaller chamber is the basal part of the left systemic arch.
The two systemic vessels fig.
4 Ao.s Ao.d pass in the usual manner as two arches to the dorsal region just posterior to the ventricles where they form the dorsal aorta in the manner to be described in connection with the arterial system.
The further course of the primary carotid and of the right subclavian will also be described in connection with the arterial system.
The auricles are very large in proportion to the ventricles though their relative sizes will of course vary with the amount of contained blood.
The Venous System.
The Posterior Vena Cava and its Branches.
The postcava fig.
1 pc as noted above is a wide thinwalled vessel seen extending across the short space between the anterior face of the right lobe of the liver and the sinus venosus.
As was also noted above the hepatic veins vh  at any rate that from the left lobe of the liver  enter the postcava so close to the heart that they may le considered to have one or more distinct openings into the sinus venosus.
Followed caudad the postcava may he tracetl through the large right lobe of the liver from which it receives several lranches.
Emerging from the posterior border of the liver it is seen to extend caudad in the median line as a rather inconspicuous vessel that receives blood from the reproductive organs and the kidneys that lie close on either side of it.
The hepatic portal vein h has the usual distribution for that vessel.
Entering the liver in the neighborhood of the bile duct it receives first O'.e. nearest the liver a small branch from the pancreas pv near the pancreatic are one or two branches from the stomach g and a branch from the spleen sp.
A short distance caudad to these vessels are two or three mesenteric veins m leading from the mesentery and small intestine.
Caudad to the mesenteries the portal system may be seen as a vein of diminished caliber i leading from the posterior part of the small intestine and from the large intestine.
The connection mentioned by Bronn between the rectal ranch of the portal vein and the caudal vein could not be demonstrated.
After entering the liver the portal of course breaks up into capillaries and the blood thus distributed is recollected by the capillaries of the hepatic veins above mentioned.
The internal epigastric veins ep are perhaps the most conspicuous vessels of the postcaval system.
When the ventral abdominal wall of the animal is removed they may be seen extending forward from the pelvic region on each side of the body to enter the posterior edge of the liver.
The epigastric of the right side enters the large or right lobe of the liver where it breaks up into capillaries the left epigastric sends its main branch into the left lobe of the liver but also sends a branch over to enter the right lobe.
Following the epigastrics caudad they are seen to receive vessels from nearly all parts of the posterior region of the body.
The left epigastric which extends across the ventral side of the stomach receives from that organ four or five branches g while the farther removed right epigastric receives only one or two branches from the stomach.
Posterior to these gastric veins the epigastrics receive one or more veins b from the body wall and skin.
Posterior again to the lastnamed veins each epigastric receives in the pelvic region a large vein the iliac il which receives in turn a vein from the pelvis pi and continues down the thigh and lower leg to the foot as the femoral f the chief vein of the posterior appendage.
After receiving small branches from the muscles of the thigh the femoral receives near the knee a small branch from the posterior surface of the lower leg fb and a larger one t that leads from the anterior surface of the lower leg and foot.
The veins of the pes were so small in the comparatively small animals it was necessary to use that their distribution could not be determined with certainty though they seemed to parallel very closely their corresponding arteries to be described below.
A short distance caudad to the iliac veins each epigastric receives one or two fairly large branches from the pelvic region called by Bronn the ischiadic veins is.
Caudad to the ischiadics and dorsal to the cloaca each epigastric is united with a short but wide renal portal or renal advehente vein rp leading to the posterior border of its respective kidney and receiving on the way a short branch from the pelvic region shown just cephalad to the references lines rt and rp.
Very close to its junction with the renal portals each epigastric gives off a small branch which unites with its fellow of the opposite side to form a median vein rt the rectal leading from the posterior part of the large intestine.
A very short distance caudal to these last veins in the region just dorsal to the anal opening the epigastrics are formed by the division of the caudal vein cv which of course brings blood from the tail and is on account of the large size of that organ of considerable caliber.
The Anterior Vence Cavce and their Branches.
The entrance of the precaval veins into the heart was mentioned above their branches in order from the heart cephalad will now be described.
Since the two precavse are alike it will be necessary to describe the branches of only one side of the body.
After leaving the heart the precava may be traced forward for a short distance at the side of the trachea and cjesophagus as a wide thinwalled trunk fig.
2 vca.
The first tributaries that it receives arc the internal mammary and vertebral veins which join it at the base of the neck at almost the same place.
The internal mammary fig.
2 im is a rather small vein lringing blood from the ventral wall of the thorax.
It may be followed along the inner surface of the ribs near the sternum in company with its corresponding artery.
The vertebral vein fig.
2 v is also of small diameter and extends to the dorsal body wall near the spinal colunm from which region it returns blood to the anterior vena cava it is drawn too large in the figure.
Just cephalad to the vertebral and internal Aiammary the internal jugular j enters the precava.
The internal jugular may be followed directly forward close to the side of the trachea and oesophagus from which it receives numerous branches.
Near its point of entrance to or rather exit from the skull it anastomoses by two or three short branches with the external jugular ej to be described later.
Its distribution in the cranial cavity could not be determined in the available material.
At the point of entry of the internal jugular the precava passes laterad for a short distance and then divides into two more or less equal branches the abovementioned external jugular ej and the subclavian s of which the latter will first be described.
The subclavian s of course returns blood from the regions of the shoulder and arm.
On reaching the body wall where it might be called the axillary ax it receives on its posterior side a large thoracic vein t which returns blood from the thorax shoulder and skin.
The thoracic receives a branch from the posterior surface of the arm which might be called the postbrachial pb this postbrachial may be traced as a rather small vessel to the hand at the elbow it is connected by one or more small branches with the brachial.
Just distal to the thoracic the axillary vein receives two fairly large vessels the subscapulars sc that return blood from the shoulder and upper arm.
After receiving the subscapulars the axillary may be followed into the upper arm as the brachial br.
As has been said the brachial and postbrachial anastomose near the elbow and in this region the former receives a small vessel that extends parallel to it from the manus.
In the forearm the brachial may be called the radial fig.
2 A ra on the back of the manus the radial receives branches from the various digits and from a rather complex plexus of vessels in the carpal region.
The external jugular fig.
2 ej after separating from the subclavian may be traced cephalad close beneath the skin to the base of the skull where it is connected with the internal jugular by short branches as has already been noted.
It receives several small branches from the skin and muscles of the neck and shoulder regions.
At the region of its anastomosis with the internal jugular it receives a large branch the muscular ms from the massive muscle at the angle of the jaw and from the skin of that region.
A short distance cephalad to the muscular the external jugular receives on its mesial side two or three branches from the trachea larynx and oesophagus tr.
Anterior to these vessels the external jugular is formed by the union of two chief veins the lingual 1 from the ventrolateral surface of the tongue and the inferior dental id from the mesial surface of the lower jaw.
The connection of the superior dental extending along the bases of the maxillary teeth with the jugular could not be determined with certainty hence that vessel is not shown in the figure.
The same is true of the small veins in the region of the cranium.
The Arterial System.
The Abdominal Aorta and its Branches.
The right and left aortic arches fig.
3 Ao.d Ao.s arising from the heart in the manner already described form a rather long loop and approach each other in the middorsal line.
Here they are united by a short wide connective in such a way that the left arch seems continued into the coeliac arterj and the right into the dorsal aorta proper.
Each arch anterior to the connective gives off two fairly large branches oe to the posterior region of the oesophagus.
The cceliac arterj fig.
3 c is the largest branch of the abdominal aortic system.
After giving off a couple of small branches oe to the posterior region of the oesophagus it gives off a large splenointestinal artery si to the spleen and small intestine.
The coeliac then breaks up into three arteries of about the same size the gastrohepaticointestinal ghi carrying blood to the stomach liver and small intestine the pancreointestinal pi leading to the pancreas and small intestine and the gastric ga to the greater part of the stomach.
From the dorsal aorta proper da which as has been said seems to be the direct continuation of the right aortic arch several arteries are given off these will be described as they occur in an anterioposterior direction.
At about the point of union of the two aortic arches arises the most anterior of seven or eight pairs of lumbar arteries lu 17 this first lumbar artery is continued cephalad for some distance as a longitudinal trunk that gives off several lateral branches to the walls of the thoracic region.
The other six or seven lumbars are distributed to the dorsal body wall and arise at more or less regular intervals as far caudad as the sacrum or even back of that point.
The first large branch of the aorta is the unpaired mesenteric artery m which is given off in about the region of the fourth pair of lumbars it carries blood through the mesentery to the greater part of the small intestine and also sends a small branch to the large intestine.
Posterior to the mesenteric the aorta gives off four or five pairs of short arteries the urogenitals u 14 that lead to the nearby reproductive organs and kidneys.
About the middle region of the kidneys a short distance anterior to the sacrum is given off a pair of rather large arteries called by Bronn the ischiadicce is each ischiadica after giving off a couple of small branches to the back passes laterad and divides into three main branches P to the ventral body wall 3 to the anterior border and deeper region of the thigh and 2 to the pelvis.
In the region of the sacrum is given off a pair of iliac arteries il Each iliac is of about the same diameter as the ischiadica and gives off soon after leaving the aorta an artery ab that apparently leads chiefly to the abdominal muscles.
Distal to the origin of the abdominal the iliac gives off a small pelvic artery pa which leads as the name would indicate to the pelvis.
The iliac then passes into the thigh where it gives off several large branches and may be called the sciatic sc.
At the knee the sciatic gives off two rather small branches one the fibular artery f  extends down along the posterior side of the lower leg the other is parallel to the first and may be called the tibial artery tb since it extends along the anterior or tibial side of the shank.
These two arteries give off numerous branches to the muscles of the lower leg.
After giving off the fibular and tibial arteries the sciatic passes as a large vessel through the lower leg to which it gives but few branches and may here be called the crural artery cr.
At the tarsus it divides rather suddenly and perhaps variably into four chief branches leading to the toes.
A short distance caudad to the origin of the iliacs the dorsal aorta gives off a pair of small pelvic arteries pa going to the muscles of that region.
Caudal to these pelvis arteries is given off the unpaired first hcemorrhoidal artery he which divides into a rectal rt and a cloacal cl branch.
Caudal to the first hsemorrhoidal arises the second hcemorrhoidal he also unpaired leading to the cloaca.
Posterior to the second haemorrhoidal the aorta continues into the tail as the large caudal artery ca.
28 The Anterior Arteries.
The origin of the great arterial trunks  the pulmonary aortic arches primary carotid and right subclavian  has already been given and the distribution of the pulmonary arteries and aortic arches has been described so that it now remains to describe the distribution of the right subclavian fig.
4 Sc.d and the primary carotid capr.
The right subclavian Sc.d. since it has an independent origin from the heart instead of arising as a branch of the primary carotid will he described first.
After leaving the heart it passes cephalad and laterad and gives off the following branches in order beginning at the heart an oesophageal artery oe a small caudally directed vessel carrying blood to the posterior region of the oesophagus.
Close to the oesophageal arises another small caudally directed vessel the pleural artery plu extending to the pleura and possibly to the pericardium.
From the same region as the preceding two arteries but extending cephalad along the trachea and oesophagus arises the much larger branch of the right subclavian the right collateralis colli cc whose course and distribution will be described later.
Close to the distal side of the collateralis colli arises the very small thyroid artery th leading to the oval thyroid gland that lies against the ventral surface of the trachea a short distance anterior to the heart.
A short distance distal to the thyroid artery the subclavian gives off a fairly large artery the internal mammary im shown too large in the figure that passes to the inner surface of the ribs near the sternum and lies parallel to the vein of the same name described above.
A short distance distal to the internal mammary arises an artery of about the same diameter the vertebral v it passes dorsad and caudad to the region of the thoracic vertebrae.
After giving off the five vessels just described the subclavian artery passes into the shoulder where it divides into three main branches a the subscapular sc going to the skin and muscles of the shoulder b the thoracic t carrying blood to the posterior muscles of the shoulder and to the posterior region of the upper arm c the brachial br which is really the continuation of the subclavian and is the chief artery of the anterior appendage.
After sending several branches to the upper arm the brachial divides in the region of the elbow into two main vessels the radial ra and ulnar uP arteries fig.
4 A.
The radial artery in the caral region divides in a complicated way into five main vessels that extend into the digits.
The ulnar artery gives off several branches to the forearm but apparently does not connect directly  with the branches to the digits.
The primary carotid capr.
After leaving the heart this very largo vessel passes cephalad and laterad for some distance on the left side of the body and then gives off from its anterior side the large left subclavian artery sc.s. to be described later.
After giving off the subclavian artery it makes a short loop still further to the left and then turns sharply mecliad to pass to the head in the median plane directly dorsal to the oesophagus.
Its distribution in the cervical and cephalic region will be described later.
The mate to the oesophageal branch oe near heart of the right subclavian which was mentioned above is apparently sometimes given off from the primary carotid near its base as shown in fig.
4 and sometimes as a branch of the left pleural artery.
The left subclavian artery sc.s. although it has a different origin has the same branches as described in connection with the right subclavian.
The exact order in which the first of these the thyroid th the internal mammary im'  the coUateralis colli cc the pleural plu and the vertebral v are given off is as might be expected subject to some variation.
The coUateralis colli cc following Bronn's nomenclature whose origin was noted above will now be discussed since the two are alike only one need be described.
After leaving the subclavian it passes cephalad at the side of the trachea and oesophagus in company with the internal jugular vein so that in this part of its course it would seem to be the internal carotid artery.
It gives numerous small twigs to the trachea and oesophagus oe.
In the region of the posterior part of the huge jaw muscle it is connected directly x with the adjacent branch cm called by Bronn the common carotid of the primary carotid and indirectly x with a complicated group of branches from the common carotid.
Cephalad to the connective x which extends dorsad and is hence foreshortened in the figure the coUateralis colli gives off a small vessel y too large in fig 4 to the shoulder and skin it then sends a fairly large branch jm into the large jaw muscle close to which it now lies.
Next a small branch Ig is sent to the larynx.
Continuing cephalad and laterad in figure 4 it is drawn further to the side than it actually lies for a short distance further it divides into three branches 1 a short twig mg that goes to the musk gland on the side of the mandible and to the skin of that region 2 a large branch the mandibular md that enters the large foramen on the mesial side of the mandible and extends in the cavity of that bone throughout its entire length 3 the lingual artery P which in turn divides some distance cephalad into two branches one extending along the lateral region the other nearer the midventral surface of the tongue.
It is seen then that the collateralis colli arteries supply directly the lower side of the head  tongue mandible etc.
 though they may also send blood through the abovementioned connectives to the brain and dorsal regions of the skull.
The 'primary carotid capr as was noted above makes a curve to the left after leaving the heart and then passes back to the median plane where it may be seen lying against the ventral side of the neck muscles and dorsal to the oesophagus in this place it gives off a series of unpaired cervical arteries fig.
4 ce each of which almost immediately divides into an anterior and a posterior branch that carry blood to the cervical vertebrae.
At the base of the skull in the region where it is united by the first connective x with the collateralis colli as described above the primary carotid divides into two similar branches called by Bronn the common carotids cm.
The distribution of these two vessels is symmetrical so that only one need be described.
While the collateralis colli as has been said carry blood chiefly to the tongue and lower jaw the common carotids supply the cranium and upper jaw.
Soon after its formation by the division of the primary carotid the common carotid is joined as noted above with the collateralis colli of that side by the connective x since the common carotid and its branches all lie dorsal to the collateralis colli and its branches the connectives x and x extend in a more or less dorsoventral direction.
The two common carotids almost completely surrounded by bone in passing cephalad sweep first lateralad then mediad so that they together form almost a complete ellipse as seen in figure 4 there is however no apparent connection between them at the anterior region Avhere they lie so close together.
A short distance cephalad to the connective x the common carotid is connected laterally z with a rather complicated plexus of vessels lying at the base of the skull it is through this plexus that the common carotid is connected with the collateralis colli by the second connective x The short branch z quickly divides into three parts 1 a small anteriorly directed vessel which may be called the internal carotid ic since it enters the skull through the most ventral of the three foramina in the exoccipital and probably supplies the brain though its further course could not be followed 2 a somewhat larger posteriorly directed artery oc going to the muscles at the occipital region of the skull 3 a short laterally directed stem z The lastnamed branch z in turn leads in three directions a to the coUateralis colli artery through the connective x  b a short anteriorly directed vessel e that passes into the skull possibly to the ear through the large foramen that lies between the exoccipital and quadrate bones it gives off a small twig q to the muscles in the region of the jaw articulation quadrate  c the main stem of the branch z continues laterad and cephalad as one of the chief arteries z to the anterior region of the skull giving off a fairly wide branch jm to the large jaw muscle and then two branches o and o to the lateral surface of the eyeball and socket it then anastomoses just cephalad and laterad to the eye with the forward continuation cm of the corresponding main stem cm of the common carotid already mentioned.
The vessel cm' after almost meeting its fellow in the middle line passes cephalad and laterad across the ventral surface of the eye to the union above mentioned with the lateral branch z at the posteriormesial border of the eye it gives off a branch that divides into two twigs one o for the posterior eye muscles and one e to the region of the ear and the top of the skull.
At the point of union of the branches cm and z a sort of simple plexus may be formed from which two vessels n pass to the posterior nasal region and two vessels pass forward along the side of the upper jaw.
Of the latter two vessels one which may be called the inferior dental of the maxilla dm is very small and extends along the maxilla to its very tip at the base of the teeth and ventral to the palatine bone the other which is larger and may be called the superior dental of the maxilla dm' extends cephalad along the mesial side of the maxilla dorsal to the palatine bone it sends numerous twigs into the maxillary bone among the roots of the teeth.
After passing nearly to the end of the snout the superior dental dm' suddenly forms a loop towards the median line and passes as a straight branch n' directly caudad near and parallel to the median plane.
The branch n' extends along the floor of the nasal cavity and after giving off twigs to this chamber ends in a network of vessels o on the anterior surface of the eyeball and socket.
424 IMay A pair of very small arteries n may be seen in the nasal chamber between and parallel to the branches n they lie close to each side of the nasal septum and supply the anterior nasal region.
They apparently arise as shown by the broken lines from the loop of the superior dental artery dm though this could not be definitely determined.

THE METHOD OF PROGRESSION IN TRUNCATELLA.
BY HENRY A. PILSBRY AND AMOS P. BROWN.
Early in August of 1913 when one of us Brown was collecting fossils along the shores of Willoughby Bay Antigua upon turning over a piece of limestone a few feet above highwater mark he came across a colony of Truncatella bilabiata Pfr.
They were very plentiful under the slab and those that were not disturbed by the lifting of the stone were seen to be in motion.
Others at once retracted the body into the shell along with the operculum and assumed the appearance of dead shells.
On observing those that continued to move it was at once noticed that they do not employ the same method as the rapidly moving Colohoshjlus and Tuclora already observed in Jamaica nor that of the Cistula observed in Antigua but seem to adopt the method of the measuring worm in their progression.
A number of the shells with the living animal were collected in a specimen bottle and upon returning to the town of St. John's they were kept under observation for some time.
In fact upon returning to Philadelphia some weeks later most of them were still quite lively and moved about actively.
It was from these survivors that the figures were drawn.
Before leaving St. John's notes upon the method of motion were made.
These observations were repeated in Philadelphia.
When disturbed or startled the animal at once withdraws into the shell and closes the opening by the operculum which in fact is drawn in beyond the lip.
They then resemble pieces of stone or fragments of dead leaves and without close observation tley would escape notice.
After they are left to themselves for a short time the animal protrudes the operculum with the foot and proboscis which latter at once begins to feel about until it encounters some firm substance when the foot is fully protruded.
The foot is a squarish pad of about 1 scjuare millimeter in area.
The proboscis may be extended to 1 mm.
or more.
It is waved to and fro until it encounters the surface over which the animal moves bending downward at the same time and presenting in front view a certain ludicrous resemblance to the head of a moose which resemblance is enhanced by the blunt expanded snout of the proboscis and by the tentacles Avhich are in the position of the ears of the moose.
The foot when fully protruded is attached firmly to the surface moved over the proboscis is then raised and waved about again and crawling commences.
The progression begins by a stretching forward of the proboscis its tip is then applied to the surface moved over and this tip flattens out until nearly the size of the foot.
If the proboscis secures a firm attachment the foot may now be released and either drawn up to the attached proboscis by sliding the edge of the foot along the surface or the entire animal may be supported upon the proboscis and the foot raised clear of the surface and drawn up to the proboscis when its edge will rest on the surface moved over.
Perhaps more often the foot is raised anteriorly and slid forward upon its posterior edge up to the attached proboscis the position assumed by the body of the animal being now the same as when it is retracted into the shell.
Starting from this position the method of progression may be described as follows The square pad of the foot is turned down anteriorly until it is firmly attached to the surface moved over simultaneously the attachment of the proboscis is released and this is moved to find another attachment as soon as this is found the firm attachment of the proboscis is effected again  then the entire shell is hitched forward as the foot is lifted and brought up in contact with the under side of the proboscis.
In case the foot is lifted clear of the surface moved over the posterior edge of the foot touches the surface first if not lifted clear of the ground this edge is slid or dragged over the surface until the foot comes up to the under side of the proboscis.
Its posterior edge is then applied to the ground and as the proboscis is loosened and raised the foot turns down until it is firmly in contact with the ground and the waving about of the proboscis and its final attachment proceeds as before.
The entire cycle of movements comprising the step is executed in four seconds.
or less so that the animal will make 15 to 17 steps in a minute when advancing steadily in one direction and in these 15 to 17 steps it will have moved over 20 to 25 mm.
of surface.
But it frequently happens that the proboscis does not secure a firm attachment and when the step is attempted the proboscis slides back to the foot and the body is not advanced at all.
The proboscis is then raised and waved about another step is attempted and generally succeeds.
The animal may thus move forward in a straight line or it may take quite an erratic course.
The shell sometimes rests upon the operculum sometimes it is simply dragged along the ground and it is jerked forward when the foot is raised sometimes supported upon the operculum but quite as often not.
The muscles controlling the movement of the foot and of the proboscis can evidently act quite independently of each other.
The external soft parts of T. hilabiata are very pale cartridge buff.
There is an illdefined fleshtinted spot on the prolOscis caused by some colored body perhaps the radula and its sack shining through.
The proboscis has faint annular wrinkles.
Compared with other land operculate snails we have seen alive Truncatella is remarkable for the small size of the foot and the extraordinary development of the proboscis.
The terrestrial prosobranch gastropods show a good deal of diversity in dealing with the problem of progression on a dry surface.
The Cyclophoridce glide like aquatic taenioglossate forms.
The Ericiidce move by the forward translation of vertical folds alternating on the two sides of the foot while the Trimcatellidce step.
The gait of Pomatiopsis lapidaria is intermediate between the step and the glide and serves to show how the gait of Truncatella was probably evolved.
The proboscis and oral disk are used exactly as in Truncatella but the foot moves by gliding or sliding first the fore part moving forward to the proboscis then the back part.

LIST OF LAND AND FRESHWATER MOLLUSKS OF ANTIGUA.

Pleurodonte formosa Fer..
Hills above Willoughby Bay St. Philips Parish also hills above St. Mary's Rectory.
Near Hodge's Point and near St. George's Church Pleistocene.
Also from Barbuda.
The only places where P. formosa was seen living were two namely in the southeastern part of the island in the hills above Willoughby Bay St. Philip's Parish  and in the southwestern part of the island near St. Mary's Rectory.
It appears to be arboreal in habit now though perhaps descending to the ground to deposit eggs.
No doubt it is found living among the hills all through the southwestern corner of the island this portion is still fairly well covered with woods and affords good cover.
While found fossil in the northern and northeastern portions as at Hodge's Bay on the north shore and at St. George's Church along the eastern shore the probability is that the species is extinct in this portion of the island as all the woods have been cut thus destroying the natural cover.
The northwestern portion of the island is wooded in the vicinity of Wetherill's Bay but the woods are probably only of recent growth and no recent specimens of this species were found there.
In the southwestern portion in St. Mary's Parish living specimens are.
found mainly on the loblolly trees Pisonia suhcaudata  although the woods are sufciently dense to afford moist conditions in many places.
In the less wooded and hence arid parts of St. Mary's the specimens are also found living in the trees.
In the region of Willoughby Bay Parish of St. Philip the conditions are still more arid and living specimens were seen only on the trees.
The wild pines Bromeliacece seem to be the places where the living mollusks are most certainly to be met with.
These epiphytes containing as they do in the axils of their leaves the only water commonly to be found on these dry hills are evidently resorted to by the mollusks for their supply of moisture and it is the presence of these wild pines with their constant supply of moisture that has tempted the P. formosa to acquire an arboreal habit and pass from ground forms to a more or less arboreal life.
