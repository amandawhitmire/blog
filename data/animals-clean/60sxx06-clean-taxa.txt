Introduction.
It is a widely recognized fact that animals raised in confinement differ in various ways from those in the wild state.
The differences 1 The writer takes great pleasure in thanldng Dr. J. Percy Moore and Dr. E. G. Conklin in particular for many helpful suggestions and criticisms in carrying out the work.
that are most easily observed are those of relative rate of growth and of relative fertility.
Although naturalists for many years have recorded cases of this sort few have undertaken an experimental study of the factors concerned.
External conditions modifying one structure of an organism have usually been found to be correlated with similar modifications in other organs yet few correlations between dissimilar physiological processes have ever been observed although most naturalists hold them to be present.
In studying the effect of confinement on organisms nearly all investigators have chosen the Pond Snail as an animal admirably adapted to their purpose.
Perhaps it is largely due to the abundance to the hardiness to the rapidity of growth and above all to the extreme sensibihty of Pond Snails to any slight change in environment that they have been so universally chosen.

Historical.
Jebez Hogg '54 discovered that Lymnoea confined in small aquaria were much smaller than their brothers of the same egg case raised in a large one.
The latter were full grown and had produced young which were as large as the former at the end of six months.
Hogg attempted to explain this phenomenon by saying that the snail had the power of adapting itself to the necessities of its existence.
Carl Semper '79 did not consider this as an explanation.
He believed that there was a definite factor that would cause dwarfing.
This led him to perform a series of experiments with various sized containers.
The conclusion that he arrived at was as follows that there was a chemical in the water he had the water analyzed but nothing was discovered that stimulates growth without actually contributing to it but yet is essential like oil to a steam engine.
The next investigator to enter this field was E. Yung '78 '85.
He proceeded to raise tadpoles from the egg in various sized and shaped containers.
He found that those with the greatest area exposed to the air held the largest tadpoles after a certain length of time.
The obvious conclusion was that the dwarfing was caused by lack of aeration.
Stimulated by the experiments of Semper and Yung De Varigny '94 made an attempt to solve the problem by returning to Lymncea.
After a hundred or more very careful experiments he did not dare venture any very definite conclusion but thought that the dwarfing of these Pond Snails was caused by lack of exercise.
Both Semper and De Varigny on a priori grounds assumed that the manner of respiration in the fresh water puhnonates was entirely performed by the socalled lung.
This caused them to overlook the factor of the aeration of the water.
Willem '96 called attention to this fact and conducted a series of experiments with this particular end in view.
Various authors had already noticed that Lymncea in deep lakes never came to the surface and that under certain conditions they could be made to visit the surface very seldom.
Acting on these suggestions he performed his experiments by running a stream of air bubbles through the water using De Varigny's experiments as a basis.
By this means he was able to explain all of De Varigny's results as due to the simple factor of aeration of the water.
Parallel to the experiments of De Varigny '94 and Willem '96 Vernon '95 experimented at Naples on the growth of Echinoderm larvffi.
His conclusions were that dwarfing in confined spaces was due to the concentration of excretory secretions in the medium.
Aeration seemed not to be a factor in the growth of Echinoderm larvae except for the fact that aeration would tend to oxidize the waste products of metabolism.
Warren '00 as a result of experiments with Daphnia in confined spaces reported that the individuals were dwarfed by the accumulation of their own excretory secretions.
This was specific and did not affect the growth and abundance of other crustaceans.
It will be seen that five factors have been advanced to explain dwarfing in confined spaces.
These are lack of oxygen presence of secretions lack of exercise presence of unknown chemical and the adaption to the necessities of existence.
In commenting on these explanations Davenport '99 writes There is however much reason for believing that Hogg's conclusion is the one which with our fuller knowledge we can hardly improve upon.
In the mind of the author Hogg's explanation is not an explanation but a statement of the fact that confined spaces do affect growth.
It does not help us to understand how and why animals adapt themselves to their surroundings.
III.
Materials.
After a few preliminary experiments with Lymncea Physa and Planorhis it was soon found that the former was by far the best form for experiments in the laboratory.
There are several reasons for this.
Lymncea is abundant in the ponds and streams about Philadelphia.
It is not quite as abundant perhaps as is Physa yet except when the ponds are frozen in the winter is easily procured.
A fact of the greatest importance is that eggs are laid throughout the winter and that these eggs ordinarily develop with slight mortality.
The Lymmea on which the following experiments were performed was identified by Dr. H. A. Pilsbry as Lymncea columella Say.
This is the most common Lymncea in the neighborhood of Philadelphia.
The specimens were procured in certain ponds in Fairmount Park in a stream near Bryn Mawr and in the Vivarium of the University of Pennsylvania the latter had come from an unknown source.
The numJDer of eggs laid at one time by Lymncea columella may vary between one egg and ninety.
The egg is as in the case of other Basiommatophora imbedded in an albuminous food material all of which is enclosed by a membrane.
This membrane is in turn imbedded in a shmy jelly in which lie the other eggs laid at the same time.
This slimy jelly is again surrounded by an outer layer of jelly which is quite tough when compared to that matrix which holds the eggs.
This tough jelly is thick on the free side but thin where it cements the eggs to the substratum.
In the act of hatching the young snail which crawls around inside of the membrane finds its way into the soft jelly mass.
After spending a day or two eating this substance it finally ruptures the wall of tough jelly and escapes.
In this jelly mass the eggs are usually placed in three rows.
Although the number of eggs may vary greatly yet in the winter time the average number is about twenty.
When adult snails as soon as the ice is off the ponds in the spring are brought into the laboratory they lay the largest number of eggs in a capsule.
This fact will be discussed later.
To shed some light on the behavior of the snail after hatching an egg case containing four young was placed in a dish of water and the positions of the snails after hatching plotted at intervals of five minutes for a period of fortyfour hours.
From the data gathered in this manner the following generalizations were made  1.
Although on hatching the lung contained no air yet 95 minutes 50 minutes 110 minutes and 60 minutes respectively were consumed by the different snails in reaching the surface of the water.
One snail captured an air bubble before it left the egg case.
2.
The movements of snails previous to their reaching the surface were more or less at random and they paid very little attention to the direction of the diffused light in which the experiment was started.
However on first reaching the edge of the dish they in every case crawled up to the surface.
The snail that captured the air bubble 27 wandered for 110 minutes after leaving the capsule and then reached the surface by a different method.
Letting go from its substratum this snail floated up and proceeded to crawl on the surface film precisely Hke an adult snail.
3.
In this experiment the snails without exception rested at night.
The lack of activity may be due to slightly cooler water yet the dish was kept in a warm room all of the time.
Although these snails had no experience of the oustide world yet they acted as far as this experiment indicates exactly as adults.
Walter '06 has given us the most complete account of the bionomics of Lymncea.
Using his work as a basis it is necessary to call to mind certain activities of the animal.
Lymncea has four methods of locomotion which may be roughly described as gliding hunching dangling and dropping.
The last two methods are rare and it is not necessary to consider them in this place.
The first method is the most common.
It consists in the cilia of the foot beating on a path of mucus secreted by the animal and attached to the substratum.
When the snail is oui of water when its supply of mucus is inadequate and when certain stimuli are applied the snail resorts to the hunching method which consists of muscular movements of the foot which bring the snail forward.
This is something like the movements of a measuring worm.
Whatever method the snail uses it is attached to some substratum whether it be the sides of the aquarium or the surface film of the water or suspended by a string of mucus from the surface film or anchored by a string of mucus from the bottom.
In these ways the snail can browse on water plants on the sides of the aquarium and gather the algse floating on the surface Plankton fishing of Brockmeier '98  but cannot gather any amount of food suspended in the water.
We have seen by the experiments of Hogg Semper and De Varigny that certain external conditions will inhibit growth in Lymmea.
It is interesting to know just what structural differences exist between the fullgrown snail the dwarf and a normal growing snail the size of the dwarf.
Hogg '54 noticed that the dwarfed snail had many characteristics of the newly hatched individual.
A comparison of the structure of a dwarf with a j'oung snail of equal size that was being raised under favorable conditions and a comparison of the structure of a dwarf with a snail of the same age that had spent its growing period under favorable conditions and therefore much larger will show certain relations.
These relations are as follows  1.
Of snails the same size but not the same age the number of whorls of the shell are the same.
1908.
2.
The same relation holds true with regard to the arrangement of the viscera i.e. lobes of the liver stomach and intestines.
3.
Cytologically however the tissues of the young snail are quite different from the older ones.
As an instance of this the liver of the young snail contains large cells laden with yolk all of which has been completely absorbed in the dwarf.
In a pond near Geneva Brot found that Lymtuea had a malformation on the columella that seemed to be correlate i with the presence of Hydra viridis
If a snail be long dwarfed and later be put ijnder favorable conditions the shell is often strangely distorted.
The pond near Geneva may have nearly dried up and suddenly filled up'again.
All the snails in the pond would be under unfavorable conditions and dwarfed.
The pond filling up would offer ideal conditions and the snails would grow.
Dr. Pilsbry informed the writer that he has noted cases of this sort.
A question of great interest is will a dwarf put under favorable conditions grow up
In Lymncea many experiments seem to show that a dwarf does not cease to grow but rather ceases to grow fast.
If however the snail is put under favorable conditions it starts at once to grow faster and may ''grow up.
However they seem ''deUcate and it is with difficulty that they are raised.
In this section the writer has attempted to outline some of the points that have certain bearings on the experiments to come.
IV Methods.
In the brief review of the experiments of various authors that has been given certain controllable factors were shown that would affect in certain ways the growth of animals.
Every author on a priori grounds has assumed that 1 food supply will influence growth.
It was found by Hogg '54 and by Semper 74 that 2 the volume of water affected growth.
Semper showed that 3 temperature also was a factor that could not be neglected and that 4 the number of individuals reacted in some manner on one another.
Willem '96 proved that 5 aeration of the water affected the growth of Lymncea even as Yung '79 had previously observed for tadpoles.
De Varigny considered that a large 6 area on which a snail could crawl was beneficial to growth.
The effect of 7 light was recognized by Higgenbottom '50 and by Yung '80.
'ernon '95'99 completed this list by adding to it a factor 8 the chemical composition of the water.
 Cited from the Camh.
Nat.
Hist. Mollusks p. S8.
There are eight variable factors that have been considered to affect the growth processes of aquatic animals.
Each factor however is not of equal weight but should be held in mind and controlled if possible in an experimental study.
Using the topics named above as a basis for study the general plan of the experiments that follow in the subsequent section will be to keep every other factor constant and vary one alone.
Precautions.
 The experiments were carried out principally in battery jars.
The size used in the majority of the experiments was 4 inches in diameter by 5 inches high.
Other vessels used were 5x6 battery jars 8 x 10 battery jars and 12inch dishes.
In order to save repetition we will consider here the methods employed in every case.
Where this order has been deviated from it will be mentioned in its place.
1 Before each experiment the jars were washed out and wiped clean.
In the later experiments the jars were washed with oxidizing solution potassium bichromate in concentrated sulphuric acid as an extra precaution.
2 The water used in the experiments was taken from a large aquarium in the University Vivarium which contained fish.
This was done to introduce algae etc. without the danger of adding young snails with it.
3 In any one experiment the jars used were similar the water was taken from the same source and the same amount of water was used unless stated otherwise.
These conditions being fulfilled the composition of the water the algae for food and the temperature must vary in the same way.
4 In a given experiment the jars were placed near together and care was taken so that each received an equal amount of light.
5 Over each was placed a glass plate to prevent evaporation and the escape of the snails.
This latter apparently suicidal behavior as described by Walter was found often occurring.
In many of the cases that have come under observation this was caused by the vapor condensing on the glass sides of the jar above the water.
Up this wet glass the snail crawls until temperature changes occur that dry the glass.
The snail is then dried and killed.
Other cases are not so easy to explain.
6 Just before an egg case was ready to hatch with a section lifter it was carefully removed from its substratum and isolated in a jar of water.
If the eggs are freshly laid it is usually fatal to the embryos to remove them.
In some of the earlier experiments after the young snail has broken through the egg membrane the jelly mass was divided 1908.1 417 up SO that each piece contained an equal number of snails and placed at once under the conditions of the experiment.
As there was less mortality by letting the young snails escape from the case normally they were not placed under the conditions of the experiment until a day after they escaped from the egg case.
7 In those jars in which I have placed water plant I have tried to add pieces of water plant of equal length and foliage.
8 Where sediment was needed approximately the same amount was added to each jar.
Measurements.
 To measure growth several methods have been used.
It is possible to measure volume weight a lineal dimension of some part or the number of successively arising homodynamous structures.
In the case of the pond snail the lineal dimension of the length of the shell at once suggests itself.
To measure this the following apparatus was arranged.
A is a compound microscope with about a 7inch working distance magnifying the object about three times fig.
1  .
O is a snail on a thin glass sHde that was placed over a piece of paper ruled in millimeters..
The snail was placed with the aperture flat on the glass and the shell would be projected on the ruled lines.
Millimeters were then read off on the paper and tenths estimated.
This is sufficiently accurate where the work is purely qualitative.
A Vernier caliper could not be used on account of the delicacy of the shell.
In some cases the weight is given.
This is not alwajs satisfactory.
As growth is a three dimensional phenomenon weight more nearly Fig.
1. represents growth.
However the writer found that the snails large and small are mathematically similar.
That is the weights are proportional to the cubes of the length.
In determining the average weight all the snails from a given experiment were placed on a microscopic slide of known weight and all excess water wiped away with a clean handkerchief or with lens paper.
They were then let dry for three or four minutes and weighed.
Dividing the weight found for the snails by the number gives the average.
Tables.
 The results of experiments are placed in tabular form.
Each experiment consists of two parts  the second member of the pair is in every case the control or the condition most nearly normal.
The variable factor precedes it.
A detailed description of the vertical columns of the tables will now be considered.

Column 9.
 The quantity in this column is the per cent of the difference to the largest average of the pair.
To be able to compare the per cent difference of the weights with those of lengths the following formula was used being based on the fact that the snails are similar.
a and b are two members of a pair expressed in grams and a  b.
Since the shells are similar mathematically then Analysis of Experiments.
 To bring the mass of experiments into a form in which they may be more easih' considered a subsidiary table has been compiled from the primary ones.
This table consists of four columns p. 420a.
Column 1 contains the number of the primary talkie for reference.
Column 2 gives the number of experiments in the primary tables that are favorable to the presence of a factor.
Column 3 gives the number of experiments in the primary tables that are favorable to the absence of a factor.
Column 4 shows the number of experiments that are indeterminate.
To determine whether an experiment is indeterminate or not certain rules are followed  1.
If there has been a large mortality among the snails which were the larger at the end of the experiment the difference was considered indeterminate.
The fact that they were the larger could be explained by the fact that they were the fewer.
If however the opposite was true i.e. the mortality was among the smaller snails then the probability is that they are fewer because the conditions have been the more severe.
2.
An experiment has been considered indeterminate if there was a large mortality on both sides of the experiment notwithstanding the fact that the remaining numbers are nearly equal.
The reason for this is the probability that an uncontrolled factor has been acting.
3.
When a known factor has acted on one portion of the experiment and not on the other the difference has been considered indeterminate.
4.
Those experiments where the difference is under 10 per cent of the greatest average has been believed to be indeterminate.
This purely arbitrary criterion has been devised to allow for two uncontrollable errors  individual variation and errors in measurement.
The obvious way to correct these errors would be to make use of large numbers of individuals in single experiments.
As the number of eggs in a case is small and when the snails are crowded the mortality is large it has been found impossible to deal with large numbers.
A limi of error must be made that will be large enough to cover most unknown errors see next page.

Effect of Food.
 Various authors Semper Ullyet Cockerall Walter etc.
have shown that Lymncea will eat animal as well as vegetable food.
However the latter furnishes the normal diet.
This consists of diatomes desmids unicellular and filamentous algse the leaves of water plants and dead leaves of trees.
If a snail after hatching is placed in a clean battery jar with 500 cc.
of clear pond water that snail will grow the necessary amount of food being supplied by the microscopic algae introduced with the water which will increase faster than the snail can eat up.
If the temperature is favorable in the course of two months the snail will reach 7 mm.
or 8 mm.
in altitude and become sexually mature.
The fact that the supply of food keeps ahead of the demand is interesting and led to a series of experiments Boiled water from a jar in which a snail had been raised.

421 with Myriophyllum and Elodeasee the effect of these water plants and to discover whether or not their presence is beneficial.
A priori one would consider that the effect of these larger water plants as ElodeaMyriophyllum would be beneficial.
My experiments seemed in indicate that their effect was the opposite.
I at once started a great number of experiments in this line.
Some experiments as can be seen in Table I and Table II went decidedly one way and some went decidedly the other.
The results were chaotic and no generalizations were possible.
A study of the gross anatomy of Lymncea reveals the fact that the anterior portion of the stomach is highly muscular.
This muscular sac was originally described by Martin Lister ' and compared to the stomach of a mullet.
Cuvier '17 more happily compared it to the gizzard of a granivorous bird.
It was compared much later by the geologist Whitfield '82 independently of Cuvier to the gizzard of a fowl.
Whitfield showed that this organ like the gizzard is normally filled with sand in Lymncea megasoma

 The gizzard of Lymncea columella like the latter is usually filled with fine sand.
However in dissecting a number of individuals of Lymmea columella that had been raised in clean battery jars I found no sign of sand.
In a few individuals I found some grains when a dihgent search of the jar failed to reveal any more.
It seems that this individual had in its crop the only grains of sediment that the jar contained.

1 1 3.9 1 Another point of importance in these experiments was the fact that in no cases was the water plant attacked when sediment was not present.
On the other hand in jars with sediment present the normal thing was to have the leaves of the water plant cut to pieces.
To determine whether the presence or absence of sediment would affect the growth processes of the snail a number of experiments were undertaken.
The sediment used in Experiments 85 86 87 and 88 was mud from the pond in the Botanic Gardens.
This was washed and that which settled in from 1 to 5 minutes kept for experimental purposes.
Because this mud would probably introduce food into the jars soil from the garden bed was taken boiled and that which settled in from 1 to 5 minutes used in Experiments 89 and 90.
In Experiments 118121 the sediment was boiled in concentrated nitric acid evaporated to dryness and ignited.
This would surely destroy all organic matter yet the results of these experiments continued to show the benefit of the sediment.
Quartz sand and quartz pebbles washed with nitric acid gave beneficial results also.
If the Myriophyllum was washed in running water the snails did not grow as large as if it was used with the particles of sediment still clinging to the leaves.
In conclusion it seems probable that 1 the muscular gizzard filled with sand is necessary to break up the plant cells that have been torn off by the radula.
2 The absence of sand seems to have the effect of causing the snails not to rasp off cells from the tissues of water plant.
3 If there is enough small algae present Myriophyllum will have Httle or no effect on the growth.
4 An examination of the stomach of small snails under 5 mm.
shows that such plant tissue as Myriophyllum is not eaten.
With snails 5 to 12 mm. however great gashes are torn in the leaves and the stomach is filled with the crushed cells.
5 The discordant results of Tables I and II are no doubt due to the presence or absence of sediment.
Fceces.
 The amount of fseces produced by Lymruea is enormous and Walter '06 reports that Lymncea elodes forms cylinders of fsecal matter fourteen times its own length every twentyfour hours.
This collects at the bottom of the aquaria in great tangled masses.
De Varigny '94 investigated the effect of this material on the growing snail.
The result of his experiments was the stunting of the snails in the jar with the fsecal masses.
In repeating these experiments of De Varigny the writer gathered fseces from a jar in which a snail had been living for a month or two.
This matter in some cases was washed in a filter and in others by decanting.
This washed material was added to jars of snails.
The result indicated in Table IV 1908.
425 was the opposite from that found by De Varigny.
However the latter did not wash the faecal material and so introduced into the water a large amount of soluble excreted material that he himself found so harmful to the growing snail.

Observations of the fsecal matter of Lymncea shows the same thing true for these pond snails.
Although the writer did not perform any special tests on the cells found in fseces as did Rathay '98 yet the appearance of the Pleurococcus and desmids in those masses was so nearly normal that there is very little doubt that there was any change.
Other Effects of Water Plants.
 Warren '00 discovered that Daphnia in a vessel filled with Vallisneria became less and less productive.
If however the bulk of the water plant was removed the crustaceans soon regained their normal number.
As green light was found to be unfavorable to the fertility of Daphnia Warren concluded that the mass of green plant caused the light to be green and the Daphnia infertile in consequence.
It can be imagined from what has been said that the effect of water plant on the physiological processes of organisms is not simple and it is not easy at once to discover just how it acts.
2.
Aeration.
 This section should be treated under the head of the composition of the water but as Semper De Varigny Willem and Walter have each considered it separately it was thought best to follow them and make it an independent topic.
On a priori grounds Semper '79 and De Varigny '94 both decided that the only means of respiration in Lymncea was by the specially differentiated socalled lung  therefore these mollusks must come to the surface for air.
However the observations of v. Siebold '59 Pauly 77 Forel '69 74 '04 Andre '01 Walker '00 and the experiments of Willem '96 show that the respiration of the animal is in a large part carried on by the outer surface of the body.
De Varigny's Experiment.
 De Varigny noticed that dishes with the largest area contained the largest snails.
This at once suggested aeration.
To determine whether this was the true explanation he half immersed a small glass cylinder with the bottom covered with muslin in a large vessel of water.
To insure the mixture of the water in both vessels he lifted the small vessel out of the large one daily and allowed it to empty and fill when he replaced it again.
In each vessel he introduced a snail of equal size and age and at the end of the experiment the one that had a large place in which to roam was the larger.
As the water in both compartments was in communication the amount of oxygen in both vessels must be identical.
Therefore the snail having the greatest area to roam about on his exercise theory became the larger.
Willem' s Experiment.
 Semper '79 found that to carry air bubbles through a vessel containing young snails created such a disturbance that the small snails were washed from their substratum.
Willem '96 devised an apparatus for conducting air bubbles through a liquid without disturbing the water.
It consisted of a glass tube fig.
2 a immersed in the jar to be experimented on.
Below the surface was blown a hole o.
Tube c turned upon the end conducted bubbles of air into tube a.
The bubbles escaped into the water and travelled up tube a the water carried up by the bubble escaping by the hole o and the air bubble continued up the tube and escaped.
Willem repeated the experiment of De Varigny but introduced his aerating apparatus into the small jar fig.
3.
The water kept constantly interchanging in the large and small vessel caused the snails to be of equal size.
Vernon '03 explained the results of this experiment not by lack of aeration but by the increase of excretory products which did not pass freely through the muslin.
Surface Aeration.
 The experiments undertaken b the writer are considered under two heads  surface aeration and artificial aeration.
The effect of surface aeration was determined by the use of flat dishes and a battery jar for control.
To make the inside area of the jar equal to the inside area of tie dish so as to have equal areas inside the jar  Cited from Walter '06.

In some however no slides were used Table VI.
Out of seven experiments but one difference was significant and that one indicated that the larger surface was beneficial.
However these experiments seem to indicate that the effect of surface aeration is not very striking yet increased aeration by the surface of the water no doubt is of slight advantage to the growth of the snail.
Artificial Aeration.
 In a number of experiments streams of air bubbles were conducted through jars of water.
The apparatus used was a modification of that of Willem 96 see fig.
4.
In Experiments 3743 Table VII the air was passed through night and day in the remaining experiments for but eight hours a day.
The results confirm Willem's conclusion that cuticular respiration is a large factor in the growth of Lymncea.

3.8 Walter's '06 experiments show that Lymncea will live in boiled water but come to the surface more often.
If imprisoned below the surface of aerated water they die.
28 In consideration of the above the writer believes the folloing statement of Willem not altogether supported by the facts.
Willem '96 writes p. 567 Ces experiences .

3.
The Composition of the Water.
 The present study considers those conditions alone in which the composition of the water might affect the growth of pond snails under natural conditions.
Effect of Accumulation of Excreted Matter.
 De Varigny '94 grew snails in water in which a snail had been living for months with the result that the snails were dwarfed.
Vernon '95 performed similar experiments with Echinoderm larvae with the same result.
The writer has conducted experiments of this sort on Lymncea.
Table IX expresses the results of eight experiments.
These results are as follows 1 That weak solutions of the waste products of metabolism are of benefit to the snail.
2 That concentrated solutions are harmful.
3 In Experiments 136 and 199 the water was aerated so the factor of the aeration of the water would be constant.
In Experiment 143 the water was boiled yet in these two cases the results were similar.
Later the experiments of Table X were repeated with different dilutions of urea with similar results.
As these were similar to those found by Vernon '95 who used also uric acid on Echinoderm larvae it was not thought necessary to continue the experiments further.
Analyses of the water.
A year before Vernon's '99 paper was called to the attention of the writer a series of analyses were made of the water in a number of jars.
Although not nearly so extensive as those of Vernon yet the results were nearly parallel.
By the methods of water analysis Clowes and Coleman '03 the water in the jars of several experiments was analyzed for chlorides nitrates and particularly for free and for albuminoid ammonia.
The free ammonia consists largely of the inorganic salts of ammonia.
Albuminoid ammonia on the other hand is made up of organic compounds from which the ammonia radicle is not detached by boiling with sodium carbonate.
Experiments 200 and 201 Table VIII were conducted in the following manner Six jars with 500 cc.
of water which was analyzed before the experiment were taken.
Two were used without water plant or snail as control.
The other jars contained snails and water plant as follows one without water plant but with one fullgrown snail one without water plant but with five snails one with water 431 Table VIII.

This is a phenomenon well known to botanists Sachs 75  Bessy '92.
Vernon '99 found that the presence of Ulva decreased the free ammonia but increased the albuminoid ammonia.

8.0 Effect of Shell Salts.
 If it were possible to measure some other physiological process of the snail than growth another method might be instituted to attack the study of the effect of environment.
As it is possible to measure the activity of a certain tissue in the pond snail by the amount of its secretions a series of experiments were conducted.
The tissue referred to is the mantle which secretes the shell.
With this in mind a few experiments with calcium carbonate calcium sulphate and calcium phosphate.
Snails that had been raised in saturated solutions of these salts which are but shghtly soluble in water were measured the results are expressed in Table XII.
The salts were supphed as the pure chemical or as groundup Lymncea shell.
The results show that calcium sulphate is most beneficial and that the presence of shell salts are favorable to snail growth.
Experiments 5556 did not consider that the sediment of the ground mineral might introduce another factor.
Experiments 201204 consider this factor.
The fact that each chemical seems to favor a separate flora introduces another factor which makes these experiments most unsatisfactory.
Number of Individuals.
 Semper '74 and De Varigny '94 both reported that in two similar jars one containing one snail and one containing many the single one grew the larger in every case.
This fact was one of Semper's strongest arguments in favor of the presence of an unknown chemical.
De Varigny could not explain this result on his exercise theory so he advanced a psychological theory based on the fact that two snails might annoy each other.
He writes Mais que pent etre cette influence morale dans le monde des Lymnees
Le probleme est embarrassant et je n'ose decide si la presence de deux L3rmnees gene ou ne gene pas le peregrinations de la troisieme etc.
p. 187.
The result of the experiments reported in Table VI of the present work confirm the results of the authors who have investigated this factor.
Discarding both Semper's and De Varigny's explanation we must turn to a consideration of those of the later authors.
Willem '96 explained the result as due to aeration but it seems rather that Vernon's '03 explanation is more nearly true.
Vernon considers that the toxic influence of accumulations of the waste products of metabolism is the cause of the dwarfing yet increased aeration will insure more rapid oxidation of those waste products and so remove their harmf ulness.
From what has been said it will be seen that the chemical composition of the water is a very important factor in the rate of growth of Lymncea.
The composition of the water may exert a toxic or a bene1908.
435 ficial effect on the growing snail.
This has been explained in the case of effect of numbers in various ways but most reasonably by lack of aeration and of composition of the water.
It is probable that those two factors work together.
4.
Temperature.
 Semper 79 reported that snails chilled were retarded in growth and that growth ceased at 13 C. Walter '06 found that they became more active in warm water than in cold water.
The experiments of Walter '06 were repeated in the following way Four large snails 9 mm.
and four small snails 1.5 mm.
were placed in a glass dish with about 20 cc.
of water.
Under the dish a piece of crosssection paper was laid and on another piece of crosssection paper the position of each snail was plotted every five minutes for a period of three hours.
For the first hour the dish was in a cold room and the temperature fell from 12 to 6 C. The dish was then packed around with ice for half an hour until the temperature fell from 6 to 3 C. The dish was then placed in a warm room for one hour the temperature rising from 3 to 17 C. For the next twenty minutes it was placed near a radiator and the last ten minutes the dish was placed above the radiator the temperature rising from 17 to 26 C. Fig.
5 shows how the snails were affected tt represents the temperature curve the heavy black line the distance in millimeters that the small snails travelled in periods of five minutes the dotted line indicates the same thing for the large snails.

The average speed for the small snails closely follows thatfor the large ones.
The table shows several things 1 that cold apphed 436 July rather suddenly stimulates the snail to become active so as to escape from the cold.
The same reaction is noticed when heat above the optimum is applied.
2 When the water continued cold the activities decreased.

The solid line shows the same thing for the small ones.
The experiments on growth conducted by Semper did not take into account the effect of cold on the water plant.
To eUminate this factor the writer alternated the jars wdth the water plant from the warm to the cold at stated intervals but transferred the snails from one jar to the other so that certain snails remained in the warm and certain snails remained in the cold all the time yet the jars that contained them were the same and therefore the amount and condition of the food was similar.
The manner that cold acts on the growth of Lymncea may be twofold.
Cold as is so well known retards the rate of chemical combinations and so retards physiological processes.
As growth is a physiological process it is retarded and as the activities of the animal are physiological processes they are also retarded.
Growth depends largely on the presence of food yet the food of Lymnaa is acquired only through constant motion so it might easily become dwarfed with abundance of food about it if conditions should make the snail sluggish.
In LymncBa we have seen that both these factors may be at work reduced physiological processes acting directly on growth or reduced activities may actually caus dwarfing by lack of food.

Lti. Beginning with Higgenbottom '50 various writers have conducted experiments on the effect of Hght on the growth of animals.
The work of these authors including Yung 78 '80 and '92 Vernon '95 Warren '00 and Beclard '58 deals largely with the effect of colored light on the development of different animals.
The present work considers the effect of hght and darkness alone.
Although experiments were attempted with colored lights yet the many difficulties in the shape of uncontrollable factors made the results so unreliable that space will not be taken in discussing them.
Even in the experiments on light and darkness the factor of food was with difficulty controlled.
It was only by resorting to similar means as in the experiments on temperature that this factor was controlled at all.
However this did not remove all the uncontrolled factors present.
There was also the chance of there being a different temperature of the water between the two jars this difference at times amounting to 2 C. 438 July Although the experiments of Walter '06 and some of the writers seem to indicate that Lymncea is slightly negatively phototactic yet darkness is prejudicial to growth Table XV.

2.5 1.7 .8 32 This factor of light is of less importance than the other external conditions affecting growth and is one that the snail can directly control to some extent through its behavior and is also one that can be easily regulated in the laboratory.
It is almost impossible to devise experiments on the effect of light on animals whose food consists of green plants and experiments so conducted can have little significance.
6.
Area.
 According to De Varigny's exercise theory dwarfing of Lymncea was caused by too little area for the snail to crawl upon.
To test the truth of this hypothesis structures of various shapes were constructed out of microscopic slides and introduced into one of two similar jars containing snails.
As some of the structures were cemented with sealing wax sealing wax was added to the other jar of the experiment so that there was no difference between the jars except the fact that one had a larger surface exposed on which the snail could crawl than did the other.
The results Table XVI were contrary to what might have been expected from De Varigny's hypothesis.
It can hardly be that the slides hindered the snails from wandering around  on the contrary the great area exposed would form a surface on which much more algae would grow.

1.7 2.9 1.2 41 This experiment suggests some results reported by Dandino '04 on the effect of toxic sohitions on germinating peas and corn.
In toxic solutions dilute acids the addition of quartz sand washed in HCl and distilled water was 32 times as toxic as that without the sand.
The author explains this fact as the result of surface action.
In the present work experiments with quartz sand and even with pebbles caused an increase in the rate of growth.
This is an effect 440 July opposite to that found by Danclino yet it throws very Uttle light on the bad effects caused by the presence of microscopic slides.
As De Varigny used flat dishes in contrast to spherical flasks his cases of dwarfing by rearing in a small area can be referred with very little doubt to lack of aeration.
7.
Volume.
 Before the preceding series of experiments were completed so before the bad effect of the presence of microscopic slides was known in experiments with volume the inside area of the two similar jars was made equal by a structure of slides of calculated area.
The amount of water in the two jars was not the same the smaller volume of water containing the structure of slides.
Experiments without the structure were later tried but all the experiments led to the same result Table XVII  the snails in the smaller volume were the smaller.

4.7 3.0 63 Dandino referred to above found that in toxic solutions i.e. weak acids the radicles of peas and corn grew longer in a small volume than in a larger volume.
This coidcl be explained by assuming that there is but a definite amount of toxin present to act on the seed.
With the snail however the case is reversed.
The toxin which we have shown in the preceding sections to be present is ever being increased in quantity by the secretions of the animal.
In the case of the seedling the solution becomes weaker and weaker.
Pearl and Dunbar '05 found that Paramecium in small vessels were dwarfed.
This is due most likely to the accumulation of excreted matter.
In fact almost every case of this kind among aquatic animals can be so explained.
8.
Alternation of Conditions.
 In connection with some of the experiments on heat and cold a jar was moved from the warm to the cold and vice versa at two weekly intervals for a period of two months with the very striking result that the alternated snails were larger at the end of that time than those kept in the warm all of the time.
This result was accomplished notwithstanding the fact that when in the cold the water in the alternate jars was sometimes frozen.
This experiment led to a series of experiments in the same line and although many were as striking as the first yet the larger snails were those as a general rule that had been in the warm room all the time.
This control in the warm room was every two weeks transferred to a jar from the cold conditions while at the same time the jar in which they had been living was placed in the cold and snails that had lived in the cold all the time added.
This process of changing the snails was performed every two weeks or every week.
The interval of alternation is given in the tables.
See Tables VIIIXX.
Not only were alternate conditions of heat and cold considered but also alternating conditions of starving and feeding and light and dark.
The latter experiments are not of particular interest as the alternated snails are purely intermediate in size between those under favorable and those under unfavorable conditions.
The starving and feeding experiments however closely approximated those of heat and cold.
Some were larger and some were smaller than the control.
These results must mean that the change from an unfavorable to a favorable condition causes the snail to grow faster than if it were continually in the favorable condition.
9 Experiments on Tadpoles.
 As Yung '85 performed some experiments on the effect of external conditions on tadpoles arriving at the same conclusion as did Willem '96 i.e. that dwarfing was caused by lack of aeration the writer using the methods described in the preceding pages repeated these experiments with tadpoles of Rana in the spring of 1907.

VI.
Effect of External Conditions on the Number of Eggs Laid.
To supplement the experiments on the effect of external conditions on growth and to observe the effect of external conditions on some physiological process rather different from growth the following series of experiments was arranged.
When adult Lymncea is brought into the warm laboratory in the late winter or early spring it lajs an immense number of fertile eggs.
This fact was made the basis of some experiments.
Snails gathered at such a time were placed under various conditions and the number of eggs laid during a given time recorded.
Conditions that one would not consider to have any effect whatever on fertihty were quite effective in their results.
1.
Sediment.
 As we have seen on p. 424 the presence of sediment is beneficial to snail growth yet the presence of sediment is also of advantage in increasing the fertility of the snail.
Four adult snails were isolated in four jars with a small amount of sediment and four jars were similarly treated without the sediment.
At the end of some days the eggs in each jar were counted.
See Table XXI.

As the writer did not have a chance to repeat this experiment its value is only suggestive.
2.
Number of Individuals.
 In each of seven jars with Ceratophyllum was placed a single snail.
In seven other jars similarly arranged were placed two snails each.
In ten days the seven snails in seven jars laid 1149 eggs.
The fourteen snails in seven jars laid 1277 eggs.
The result of this experiment is similar to the growth experiment.
In other words two snails in a jar together do not lay twice as many eggs as a single individual but each snail lays only half as many eggs as when it is alone in the jar.
Thus again is illustrated the bad effect of the presence of the waste products of metabolism in the water.
3.
Effect of Light.
 In each of twelve similar jars one snail was placed and Ceratophyllum was added to each jar.
Six jars were placed Table XXII.

During the daytime the jar in the hght had the temperature about two degrees higher than those in the dark.
As the snails were of slightly different sizes all the jars were placed in a row with the snails in series from the largest to the smallest.
Every other jar was then put in the dark.
The experiment ran 8 days.
In the following table the number of egg capsules laid and the total number of eggs per individual is indicated.
One snail died in the dark and one died in the light.
Both are left out of account in the table.
It will be seen that those in the hght laid nearly twice as many eggs as in the dark.
5.
Other Effects and Observations.
 Snails brought into the laboratory from the ponds lay at first a great number of eggs in a single egg case and the masses laid subsequently contain fewer and fewer eggs.
See Table XXIII.
Placing two individuals together does not have an effect of revivifying the fertility of the snail but has the opposite effect.

The last eggs laid by these snails are sometimes quite abnormal.
Sometimes the eggs are fused sometimes there is a capsule or a number of small capsules without a single egg.
29 Some snails prefer to lay their eggs on the water plant others alwaj'S lay their eggs on the glass jar while still others show no preference at all.
VII.
Summary of the Conclusions.
1.
The effect of Myriophylliim and of Elodeathe growth of Lytn7icea is quite complex.
That it is not a simple factor that is being dealt with is indicated by the inconstancy of the results of the experiments.
Notwithstanding the fact that one factor has been isolated yet it is probable that there are other factors besides.
This determined factor is the presence or absence of sand in the socalled gizzard.
In the latter case plant tissue although ingested cannot be assimilated so that the snail is smaller because it actually lacks food.
On the other hand it is possible that the products of plant metabolism may have a harmful effect on the growing snail.
2.
The accumulations of fsecal matter of Lymncea instead of having the harmful effect on growth as described by De Varigny '94 when washed and filtered have a beneficial effect.
These tangled masses of unassimilated food form a great harbor for algse and so increase the food supply of the snail.
3.
The original planting of the aquarium i.e. algse accidentally introduced with the water causes great variation in the size of the snails.
4.
Experiments on artificial aeration confirm the conclusions of Yung and Willem yet experiments on surface aeration do not seem so clear.
5.
Vernon reported that Echinoderm larvae raised in solutions in which other larvae had been raised were dwarfed.
De Varigny found the same thing true for Lymncea.
Experiments on Lymncea columella confirm the results of the two authors referred to.
Weak solutions were found beneficial and concentrated solutions harmful.
Experiments using urea gave the same result.
AVliy dilute solutions of excreted matter and urea are beneficial and concentrated solutions are harmful may be explained in the following way.
The presence of the excretions which contain plant food may cause more algse snail food to grow on the other hand the solutions are harmful to snail growth.
In dilute solutions however the quantity of toxic substance may be so little harmful that an increase of food will overbalance the harmful effect.
However this explanation is not very satisfactory as the Echinoderm larva experimented on by Vernon had no mouth and so did not eat.
6.
As Semper and De Aarigny showed the number of individuals in a jar affect the rate of growth.
The cause is probably due to increased secretions and perhaps to diminished aeration.
7.
Calcium salts in the water seem on the whole beneficial to growth  calcium sulphate particularly so.
8.
Growth of Lymncea is inhibited by cold as Semper reported.
This factor may act in two ways  directly on the physiological processes of the animal and indirectlj through the inability to procure food the snail becoming too sluggish to search for it.
9.
Area.
The cause that De Varigny advanced to explain dwarfing was lack of exercise on the part of the snail.
The greater the place to crawl the greater the snail.
However when aeration was kept constant which De Varigny failed to do the results were not significant.
10.
Volume.
That the volume of the medium affects the growth of Lymncea is certain.
Willem explains the fact on the ground of aeration.
The author accepts this view but considers that the more concentrated excretions in smaller volumes must play an equal part.
11.
Alternate Conditions.
Snails under unfavorable conditions when placed under favorable ones grow faster than if they were continuously in favorable conditions.
It would seem that the change from unfavorable to favorable conditions of life acts as a stimulant for growth.
However this does not always mean that it surpasses the control size.
It rarely does that.
12.
Not only does the environment affect growth but it affects the number of eggs laid in a given time.
This fact is very important because it shows that the environment probably affects all the physiological processes and not one alone.
13.
This study reveals the fact that confinement influences the growth of aquatic animals in three ways  through the amount of food through the amount of oxygen and through the accumulations of the waste products of metabolism.
The phenomenon is not a simple one and each factor plays its own part.

THE DIRECTIVE INFLUENCE OF LIGHT ON THE GROWTH OF FOREST PLANTS.
BY JOHN W. HARSHBERGER PH.D.
It is a wellknown fact that light exercises a directive influence upon plants.
This directive influence is called heliotropism or phototropism.
When a plant is grown in the window of a room so that it is unequally illuminated that is more powerfully through the window its leaves and even its stem are turned toward the incident rays of light.
This is known as positive heliotropism.
If the common English ivy Hedera helix be grown in pots by a north window so as to emphasize better the difference in light intensities in about four weeks it will be apparent that the growing sprouts are bending toward the inner part of the room away from the stronger light.
This reaction is negative heliotropism.
The growth of forest plants is largely a question of light relationship.
Foresters recognize this fact and group trees into those intolerant of the shade and those that are tolerant.
The herbaceous plants likewise are influenced by the light which filters through the crown of leaves above.
The herbaceous spring flora of the forest requires more light than the relatively few plants which flower in the autumn require when the trees are covered with foliage.
These facts although they can be proved experimentally are not always demonstrable to the uninitiated.
One of the best illustrations that the writer has seen is the directive influence of light upon the leaves or fronds of the hayscented fern Dicksonia pilosiuscula  Dennstoedtia punctilobvla  which is widely distributed on open hillsides from New Brunswick and Ontario to Indiana and Minnesota south to Alabama and Tennessee ascending to 1680 m. in Virginia.
The stipes of this fern are pale green and chaffless covered with fine hairs and the leaves 10 dm.
long 1220 cm.
wide are ovatelanceolate acute or acuminate frequently long attenuate usually tripinnatifid thin and delicate in the woods tougher more inrolled and more erect in the sun rachis and under surface of blades glandular pubescent.
The observations which the writer wishes to record on the directive influence of light upon the position of the fronds were made at Pocono Pines Monroe County Pennsylvania where this fern is one of the most abundant species.
As the photograph will show PI.
XXIV the upper surfaces of the leaves are turned toward the hght if the ilhimination is onesided.
If the ilhimination is from all sides of the fern clump then there is no particular direction in which the leafblades face.
The onesided illumination is obtained when the ferns grow along the edge of the woods composed in the Pocono region of white pines white birches black spruces beeches and maples which on account of their dense crown cut off much of the light from behind and above so that such woods can be called appropriately dark woods.
The photograph shows how all the leaves of a single patch are turned outward toward the open field adjoining the woods in obedience to the directive influence of the light so that the leaves stand row after row all facing in one direction.
The second and more striking example of the directive influence of light is illustrated by the hobblehush Viburnum lantanoides  V. alnifolium a shrub which ranges from New Brunswick to North Carolina western New York and Iichigan but which does not occur in the woods near the City of Philadelphia.
In the dark pine woods on the Pocono plateau this shrub is extremely abundant and where the woods are the densest not only are all of the branches and the leaves directed by the incident rays of light but they show permanent structural changes which are induced by the directive light influence.
It is known that light has a most notable influence in the determination of the external form of a large number of plants.
The development of certain tissues or organs on one side of the axis of a shoot and their suppression on other parts of the plant body may be regulated experimentally by means of the character of the illumination.
This development of tissues on one side of the axis is illustrated finely in the branches of adult forestgrown specimens of the hobblebush.
If we examine young shrubs of this plant illustrated in PI.
XXV fig.
7 we see that the branching system follows the method of a dichasium.
The leaves in such young bushes stand perfectly horizontal so as to receive the incident rays of light on the upper surface of the blade and so as to present their profile to the observer standing in front of the plant.
As fig.
6 shows they arrange themselves when viewed from above in the pattern of a leaf mosaic so that none of the leaves overshadow the others.
Such plants merely show the directive influence of the light on the leaves without showing any characteristic growth differences.
The same influence of light is manifested in the stoloniferous branches which strike root and which give the common names hobblebush or triptoe to the plant fig.
8.
These plagiotropous shoots are only formed in the shade.
The diminished light canbe better used by such branches to which the moist soil offers at the same time an opportuntity to root.
Such plagiotropous stolons with elongated internodes show however orthotropous branches and we therefore have on the same shrub branches which react differently to the light some that are stoloniferous and plagiotropic others that are leafbearing and orthotropic.
After a time however the bushes assume a different habit by a suppression of parts so that the older stems show two horizontally directed branches plagiotropic which separate from the common stem in a dichotomous manner.
Now if we examine figs.
1 and 2 of PI.
XXV we see that all of the lateral spurs that are formed from such a plagiotropic branch are placed on the upper side orthotropous where their leaves receive to the best advantage the light which filters down through the leafy canopy above.
Each segment of such a branch represents a sympodium where there are a series of phytons placed one after the other in serial order.
By this method of sympodial branching each new branch with the suppression of a bud on the other side and torsion of the axis terminates in a leafy extremity and the elongation of the branch according to this arrangement depends on a lateral bud fig.
3.
In this case clearly as all of the leaves are directed dorsiventrally by light relationship the permanent branching system is determined largely by the influence which the light has had in producing a onesided growth of the lateral dichotomous branches of the adult plants.
The fruit stands vertically above the broad cordate leaves as shown in figs.
4 and 5.
Attention might be directed in closing to the color change which takes place in the leaves with the approach of autumn.
The leaves become bronzed to a greater or less extent.
Sometimes the bronze is in the form of blotches.
In other leaves one side is bronzed the other side is green and in many examples the whole leaf rapidly bronzes.
What induces the bronzing of one side of the leaf first while the other side remains of a bright green color
Is it a light reaction

A COMPARISON OF THE LANDSNAIL FAUNA OF KOREA WITH THE FAUNAS OF JAPAN AND CHINA.
BY HENRY A. PILSBRY.
The compilation of a list of Korean land molliisks gives occasion for a comparison of that fauna with the favmas of China and Japan.
In the list of Korean land snails published by Dr. O. von Moellendorff in 1887 some 26 species are catalogued of this number 7 are stated to be common to Japan 3 to China and 2 omitting the doubtful Helix ciliosa to both countries.
The fruitful researches conducted by Mr. Y. Hirase have increased the roll of known Korean forms to 58.
This number is no doubt a mere fragment of the total fauna yet it is enough to show the dominance of Japanese over Chinese forms in Korea.
This preponderance can only be explained by the theory that the submergence of the straits between Kyushu and Korea is a geologically recent event.
From the large proportion of Japanese species existing in Korea this submergence may probably have taken place not earlier than the Pliocene.
Twentyone Japanese species occur in Korea and Quelpart.
Seen Chinese species occur in Korea and Quelpart Four of these species are common to Japan and China.
The great preponderance of characteristically Japanese over Chinese species is thus evident.
Thirtytwo species and subspecies out of a total of fiftyeight are peculiar to Korea including Quelpart.
So much for the numerical relations of the species.
The faunas may also be compared qualitatively.
All of the genera and subgenera of the Korean fauna occur in Japan.
In the Clausiliidce all the species of Quelpart and Korea belong to Eiiphcedusa a group of minor importance in Japan but extending farther north on the Asiatic mainland than any other group of Clausilise.
The genus Ganesella well represented in Japan seems to be absent in Korea unless the species described as Helix Satsuma gradata proves to belong to Ganesella which seems improbable.
The absence of Ganesella and of Clausiliidoe other than Euphcedusa are the most conspicuous discrepancies between  Jahrbucher d. Deutschen Malakozoologischen Gesellschaft XIV 1887 pp.
922. the faiinse of Quelpart and Tsushima.
By the prevalence of Heniiphcedusa Ganesella and Plectotropis Tsushima is wholly Japanese in its snail fauna while Quelpart is as unequivocally Korean.
The political boundaries of Japan and Korea coincide therefore with the faunal limits.
The largely deforested condition of Quelpart and Korea is probably responsible for its rather poor land shell fauna.
In the following table the Korea column is compiled from Dr. von Moellendorff's paper and the collections of Mr. Hirase determined by the author.
The column Korean Archipelago contains a few species reported with that indefinite locality by Pfeiffer and A. Adams.
The Quelpart column contains species collected by Mr. Kuroda part of them identified by the writer the others quoted from Mr. Kuroda's list. The Matsushima Dagelet Island species were recorded by Arthur Adams who visited that island when surgeon on board H. M. S.
Actseon.
In the column of Remarks sundry notes on the affinities of the species find place.

In announcing the death of William S. Vaux Jr. which occurred July 23 1908 the Secretary remarked that it inflicted a loss of which the Academy is immediately conscious.
He was born April 1 1872 and continued the traditions of his family by manifesting an active interest in the work and wellbeing of the Academy.
He contributed to the Proceedings in conjunction with his brother important reports on glacier movements in the Canadian Rockies.
He served as Curator since January 1905 and gave special attention valuable because of his ability as an architect to the plans for the alteration and extension of the premises made possible by the recent appropriation of 150000 by the Legislature of Pennsylvania.
His singularly engaging personality and amiable disposition endeared him to his associates and the Academy deeply sympathizes with the loss his family has sustained in his untimely death.
The deaths of the follong Correspondents were also announced Spiridione Brusina May 21 1908 and Gustav Mayer July 14 1908.

The Publication Committee reported the reception of a paper entitled A Review of the Genus Piaya Lesson by Witmer Stone October 14.
Recent Additions to Our Knowledge of the Flora of Southern New Jersey.
 Mr. Witmer Stone based his remarks on the work of the Philadelphia Botanical Club especially during the past few years.
Taking Dr. Britton's Catalogue of the Flora of New Jersey published in 1889 he stated that twentysix phanerogams and ptcridophytes had been added by the Club since that date exclusive of the numerous subdivisions that have been made of older species or closely allied species not recognized as distinct b Dr. Britton.
Of the latter he had listed fiftyfive not in Dr. Britton's Catalogue and doubtless there are others.
Introduced or naturalized plants were not considered in either enumeration.
The twentysix species were as follows the nomenclature following Britton's Manual  Ophioglossum arenarium.
 Originally discovered by Mrs. E. G. Britton July 3 1897 at Holly Beach and later exterminated by a Ijuilding operation.
This species was rediscovered during the present year by Mr. Joseph Crawford at Longport and by Mr. Bayard Long at Spray Beach.

In the same pond grew Scirpus torreyi new to the State and Eleocharis rohbinsii which had not before been found out of the pine barrens while on the swampy margin occurred Eleocharis melanocarpa a species not before detected by the Chib.
It was found to be rooting at the tips of the leaves like E. rosteUata.
The occurrence of so many new or rare species in one spot was remarkable.

Senecio crawfordii.
 Originally discovered at Tulljtown Pa. this species has recently been found at several points on the New Jersey side of the river.
Among rare species marked in Dr. Britton's Catalogue as not recently collected several have been rediscovered  Triglochin maritima was found at Point Pleasant bv Mr. Stewardson Brown July 22 1902.
Tofieldia racemosa collected by iIr.
C. F. Saunders between Atsion and Tuckerton on July 4 1899 and later found in abundance at several places near Speedwell and at High Bridge by the speaker.
Lilceopsis lineata.
 Perhaps the most interesting discovery of the present year was the finding by Mr. Van Pelt and the speaker of this obscure little plant about a mile below Palermo where a fresh spring bubbles up out of the salt marsh making a hard sandy bottom which was literally covered with Lilceopsis.
The plant has been unknown from the State since its discovery by Thomas Nuttall nearly one hundred years ago in a salt marsh near Egg Harbor.
As the present spot is only a few miles from the shore of Egg Harbor it is quite possible that it is Nuttall's original locality.
The following was ordered to be printed
