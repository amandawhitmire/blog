A FURTHER CONTRIBUTION TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE Orthoptera OF ARGENTINA.
BY JAMES A. G. REHN.
In these Proceedings there recently appeared a paper by the present author entitled A Contribution to the Knowledge of the Orthoptera of Argentina. '
This study was based wholly on material collected by Mr. P. Jorgensen of Buenos Aires and submitted to us for study by that gentleman and Mr. Esben Petersen of Silkeborg Denmark.
Since the appearance of the abovementioned paper several additional collections from Argentina made almost wholly by Mr. Jorgensen have been received from the same persons and in addition a small but very interesting series from Mr. Carlos Lizer of Buenos Aires.
The combined material represents quite a few localities supplementary to those given in the previous paper while thirtyeight species are additional to the one hundred and sixtytwo there discussed.
The total number of species here treated is one hundred and fourteen of which nineteen are now recorded from Argentina for the first time while three species are new to science.
The number of specimens in the present series is four hundred and fiftyeight.
In the tabulation given on page 275 of our previous paper there can be added to the fortynine species known in Argentina only from the Misiones Territory ten of the eighteen here first recorded from Argentina.
This is directly in line with the previously indicated evidence of the richness and Brazilian affinity of the Misiones region.
The forms here first recorded from Argentina are indicated by an asterisk preceding the specific name.
The types of the new species and an adequate representation of the other forms in the collection have been retained for the Academy series.
We wish to thank Messrs. Jorgensen Lizer and Petersen for their interest and courtesy in submitting the present material to us for study.

This individual is identical with though very slightly smaller than the specimen from Puerto Bertoni Paraguay recorded by us as Demogorgon batesi Burr now considers the genera Labidura and Demogorgon to be inseparable and synonymizes batesi of Kirby under the older name xanthopus which action as far as we can determine from our material and the literature is correct.
Stal described the species from Rio Janeiro and Buenos Aires while Borelli has recorded it from Salta province of Salta Argentina.

Four males eight females three pairs in copula.
From this material it is evident that the species is dimorphic in wing length all three pairs taken in copula differing individually in this respect two pairs having the males brachypterous and the females macropterous and the other pair having the male macropterous and the female brachypterous.
Of the unmated specimens one male and one female are macropterous and four females brachypterous.
In the brachypterous individuals the apices of the tegmina vary from straight to strongly uncinate.
From the present evidence it would appear that germari Burmeister is merely the macropterous phase of the present species but we do not wish to establish this synonymy until we are better acquainted with Brazilian material of the genus.
All of the present series are of a brownish coloration some more blackish brown than others.

The Misiones specimens bear out the facts previously stated by ygi2 regarding the divergence of material from this locality from typical Buenos Aires individuals the only difference from the points there noted being the lack of dull purplish on the humeral regions of two males and the but very faint indication of it in another.
The La Cumbre adults are similar in form and coloration to Buenos Aires individuals but the tegmina and wings are shorter.
The nymphs show that the reduction of the median carina in this genus is a feature of specialization as they have it strongly elevated and considerably arcuate.

In the present species the general coloration is bister with intermediate channel of tegmina under parts of body and limbs buffy the latter flecked with bister dorsad.
The occiput is bister striped with three narrow buffy longitudinal lines.
The maxillary palpi are pale clothed with dark hairs and dth distal portion of terminal joint briefly infuscated.
The entire lower portion of the face and lateral lobes of the pronotum are buffy.
In addition to the type we have examined a female bearing the same data and one from the state of Misiones Argentina taken in February 1911 by P. Jorgensen.
These specimens are all in the collection of The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
We take pleasure in dedicating this species to our coworker Mr. Morgan Hebard whose masterly paper on the North American species of this genus has placed the study of the group on a permanent basis making possible by its comprehensive treatment of the subject the study of the genus as a whole.

Of this series the Jujuy and Misiones individuals have caudate wings the others have abbreviate mngs.
The La Cumbre specimens are more uniformly colored than the others the Chacras de Coria individuals showing more contrast between the general coloration and that of the tegmina one with strongly marked pale tegminal bases the Misiones representatives are generally pale while the Jujuy ones are dark with marked pale humeral lines.
It seems very probable that fulvipennis Blanchard is but a form of this species.
The abbreviate wings supposed to be characteristic of fulvipennis we find to be individual in this as in numerous other species of the genus and sufficient specimens are in hand to show that the relative proportionate length of the caudal femora and ovipositor varies appreciably as in other forms of the genus.
