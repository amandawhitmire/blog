Echinoderms COLLECTED OFF THE WEST COAST OF GREENLAND BY THE PRINCETON ARCTIC EXPEDITION OF 1899.
BY WALTER M. RANKIN.
The following Echinoderms were collected by the Princeton Arctic Expedition of 1899.
In compiling the list I have eudeavored to give in addition to the identification of the species some notes on the specimens  their number locality and peculiarities together with a tabulation of the distribution of the species in area and depth.
I have not attempted to give a complete synonomy of the species but merely to quote the original author and ordinarily the reference where a more complete description or figure of the species may be found.

Those near the dorsal spines are smaller than those round the lateral.
The cruciform pedicel larite however seem to differ being somewhat longer than in the type and the jaws more convex on their outer surfaces.
At the biting tip are two very large sharj teeth and smaller scattered teeth are on the concave surface.
These cruciform iedicellarise form very prominent clusters around the two lateral rows of spines.
The sjDCcies was found originally b its authors in Advent Bay Spitzbergen at a depth of 60 fathoms and they also report two specimens from the Kara Sea as a variety of A. gunnerl.
This is the first recorded specimen from Greenland waters.
The color in the living state corresponds.

Of the specimens collected all are 10rayed thus differing from the typical form which has 1113 rays.
The two specimens from Station 49 have an extreme diameter of 80 and 68 mm.
respectively and the proportion of the radii is as two to one.
The rays are broader at the base and more tapering than the typical form.
As to the adambulacral armature there are five or six spines in each plate of the longitudinal series and six in the transverse the former aie somewhat webbed at the base.
From Station 39 one specimen resembles very closely the larger one from Station 49.
The other two 60 and 80 mm.
in diameter respectively have longer more slender and less tapering rays in this respect coming closer to the typical C. papposus the proportions of the radii being about 22 to 1.
The longitudinal series of adambulacral plates have each three or four spines to a plate and the transverse series five spines.
In all five specimens the paxillce have longer more numerous and more divergent spines than does the typical form Danielssen and Koren I. c p. 44 discuss the relation of Sohister affinis Brandt to Crossaster Solaster papposus and Sladen .
c p. 4i describes a form from the Faroe Islands which he calls variety septentrionalis of C. papposu while Duncan and Sladen in the report of the Echinoderms of the Nares Expedition mention the variations from the type form in their specimens of C. papposus.
The present specimens agree with these cited descriptions in the number of the rays 10 but otherwise there are minor deviations from them all 1 am inclined to think that all are merely local varieties of an extremely variable species.

Carpenter L c supra pp.
136ff. 
discusses at length the species of Antedon belonging to the Eschrichtl group of Comatulse and gives a complete synonomy of the two species eschrichti and quadrata.
I find the differences in the material collected by this expedition to be very slight but there are five specimens from Granville Bay which seem to belong to Carpenter's quadrata.
Dr. Ortmann tells me that in life there is a distinct difference in their appearance but this is less evident in the alcoholic material.
The color of quadrata is lighter and the arms have a less feathery appearance due to the slightly greater length of the armjoints and the consequently greater distance between the pinnules.
The character however of quadrata to which Carpenter gives special weight  i. e.  the shorter third pinnule as compared with the second  I cannot find at all well marked though its joints seem as Carpenter says to be slightly longer than those of the same pinnule in escliriclitl.
According to Carpenter the two species are widely distributed through the Arctic Ocean.
Eschrichti reaches in Smith's Sound 79 N.
lat. and quadrata 81.
Both were obtained by the Challenger Expedition as far south as off Halifax at a depth of 51 fathoms.
Eschrichti was found by the  Vega  as far east as long.
92 20' E. In depth eschrichti has been dredged from 632 fathoms quadrata from 4GG fathoms.
The Nares Expedition reports both from Discovery Bay and other localities are for eschrichti Davis Strait Melville Bay Spitzbergen and coast of Siberia for quadrata Barents Sea and Kara Sea.
Of these nineteen species it will be observed that two Asterias polaris and Ophiopholk aculeata are not strictly to be reckoned with the others as they were collected in more southern stations  the former off the coast of Labrador and off Disco the latter in Battle Harbor Labrador.
The other species are all from between lat.
76 and 79 N. though some species were also found at the more southern stations.
The Arctic Echinoderm fauna has been examined with care and it was hardly to be expected that any new species would be added to the list of those already known.
It is interesting however to note at least a new distribution for Asterias gunneri.
has before this I believe never been recorded from Greenland waters.
A comparison is naturally suggested between this list and that of the collection made by Capt.
Nares of the ' ' Alert ' ' and ' ' Discovery  in 18756 from the same region and published by Duncan and Sladen in the Annals of Natural History IV Vol.
XX 1877.
We have in addition to that list one Holothurid M. rinkii and two Asterids Asterias gunneri and Cribrella oculata  while in the Princeton collection Asteracanthion Pedicellaster palmocrystallus Solaster forcifer Ophioglypha struivitzii and Astrophyton ardicum a deepwater form of the Nares collection are not represented.
Of the nineteen species in the Princeton collection all but Asterias polaris are more or less widely distributed in both American and European Arctic seas.
Increased knowledge of the distribution of Arctic Echinoderms seems to increase the probability that they are nearly all circumpolar and not confined to local areas.

Shell large subglobose thin shining translucent pinkish white slightly orangetinted at the vertex and the base.
The surface is covered with very close microscopic wavy spiral striae longitudinally irregularly coarsely wrinkled sometimes with several angular spiral ridges caused by spiral malleation.
Vertex impressed imperforate whitened by an internal thickening of the shell.
The aperture is narrow above ample below.
The right lip rises from the left side of the apical depression.
Parietal callus very thin.
The columellar lip is evenly concave broadly reflexed and the edge is not aduate except at the upper end forming a crescentshaped free plate over the axial region.

This species may easily be distinguished from H. zelandics Gray by its less globular form less convex parietal wall and the microscopic waved spiral strife and free edge of the columellar callus.
This species is larger than H. natalensis Krauss and the right lip does not rise so high above the vertex.
The spiral malleation is similar to that of Limncea palustris.

Shell almost circular somewhat truncate posteriorly nearly equilateral moderately convex shining white orcellanDus surface sculpture divaricate in fullgrown examples there is a smooth band where the diverging lines would meet.
The beaks aie slightly raised above the hinge line directed forward and located hardly in advance of the centre they are sculptured with microscopic concentric strife only which are vorn off in the largest specimen we have.
The luuule i
about oneeighth the length of the shell The anterior area under the lunule is not distinctly marked.
The groove of the ligament is long and narrow.
The margin has the interior layer very finely cnnulate but the outer layer smooth.
The hinge of the right valve is provided with a heavy cardinal tooth with a pit on each side and a single tubercular anterior and posterior lateral the posterior one being about twice as far from the beak as the anterior one.
The muscle scars are of moderate size the anterior one being long and narrowr while the posterior one is more elliptical Alt.

This species is distinguished from L. dentata Wood by not having the outer layer of the margin heavily dentate from L. cumingii A. and A. in having the diverging sculpture extending across the anterior area to the lunule and the inner layer of the margin is crenulate from L. quadrisulcata Orb.
in having a smooth band where the diverging lines would meet in fullgrown examples from L. hidtojiiana n. sp.
in having the inner layer of the margin crenulate and in the smooth band.

Shell almost circular posterior extremity squarely truncate nearly equilateral bluish white with white concentric streaks glossy porcellanous surface sculpture divaricate the diverging sculpture extending to the edge of the comparatively broad anterior area below the lunule.
The beaks are slightly raised above the hinge line directed forward located slightly in advance of the centre sculptured with rather coarse close concentric costellse only.
The lunule is very narrow beginning as a broad impression under the beak and tapers forward ending in a shallow point just above the anterior lateral tooth of the hinge.
The anterior area under the lunule is strongly defined by the termination of the diverging lines and is sculptured with irregular rough concentric striie with more or less yellow epidermis in the interstices.
The gi'oove of the ligament is lounded on the inner side by a ridge which begins as an angle near the beak and gradually becomes higher to a point about four millimeters from the end of the hinge line then suddenly descends almost to the end of the hinge line.
The inner margin of the shell is smooth neither layer being crenulate.
The hinge of the right valve has a large heav cardinal tooth in the centre with a deep pit on each side and a smaller cardinal in front directed forward.
The anterior lateral is a large tubercle with a deep chink where the adductor muscle truncates it there is scarcely any trace of a tubercle at the posterior end of the hinge.
The left valve has the pits for the corresponding cardinals of the right valve and a rather large posterior cardinal an anterior laterail like the other valve and no posterior lateral.
The anterior adductor muscle scar is very long and narrow while the posterior scar is short oval.

This species differs from L. deniata Wood in lacking the dentate margin from L. quadrisulcata Orb.
in lacking the crenulate margin.
It is distinguished from L. cumingii Ad.
and Ang.
by having a long narrow lunule more delicate texture and lower beaks  it is also much less globose.
Venus Anomalocardia malonei n. sp.
PL V figs i 5.
Shell triangular posteriorly rostrate moderately convex longer than high solid.
The color is variable some specimens are creamy white with irresfular transvcse zigzag brown spots or stripes some are almost entirely dark brown and others are light brown with a few very light radial bands and darkbrown blotches.
The interior is generally purple shading into a white margin with a brown band within the pallial line but some lack the white margin.
Sculpture both concentric and radial.
The radial ribs predominate at each end while the concentric sculpture is strongest in the middle of the valve.
Anteriorly the first eight radial ribs are prominent and densely granulose  the median portions of the valves are regularly concentrically costate and radially ribbed with finer closely packed costre prominent in the interstices the concentric costie are cut into even gianules by the crossing radial costaj  at the posterior angle of the valve there are about five or six prominent heavy squamose radial ribs from this point the radial ribs predominate and gradually become finer to the posterior margin.
Beaks prominent directed forward smooth except a few concentric growth lines.
Lunule impressed a little convex narrow about onefourth the length of ihe shell generally of a darker color than the rest of the shell and provided with six or eight longitudinal granulose ribs.
The groove of the ligament is linear tapering at the extremities.
The margin is dorsally quite evenly arcuate rounded anteriorly a trifle convex at the lunule evenly arcuate ventrally posterior obliquely truncate with a very blunt obtuse angle near the centre.
The margin is very finely crenulate beginning at the anterior side of the beak it is minutely crenulate along the edge of the lunule becoming coarser ventrally then gradually becoming finer and ends abruptly at the posterior end of the ligament.
The hinge is broad under the convex lunule narrower posteriorly with three teeth in each valve.
The right valve has the anterior tooth small lamellar and nearly parallel with lunule the middle tooth is triangular and directed forward its posterior ejid is nearly vertical while the anterior end is oblique and almost parallel to the antei'ior tooth posterior tooth large about the size of the triangular central slightly bifid or grooved at the summit directed backward.
The left valve is threetoothed anterior tooth lamellar higher than the rest directed forward central nearly lamellar vertical with a bifid or grooved summit posterior small lamellar directed obliquely backward with a pointed summit.
The adductor muscle scars of nearly equal size palhal line evenly arched with a moderately deep pallial sinus.

This species diflfers from V. squamosa Linn by being smaller and less rostrate also in having a predominance of concentric sculpture in the median portion of the valve the posterior end radially closely ribbed narrower lunule and much finer crenulation of the ventral margin.
The crenulation of the margins inside is much like V. marica.
