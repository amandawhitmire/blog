The President, Dr. Leidy, in the chair. 

Twenty -four persons present. 

On some Parasitic Worms of Birds. — Prof. Leidy stated that 
Dr. B. H. Warren, of Westchester, much interested in ornitho- 
logical pursuits, had submitted to his examination a number of 
parasitic worms obtained in the preparation of specimens. 
Recently he had sent to him the carcass of a Snow Bird, Junco 
hyemalis, in which he reported a multitude of worms filling the 




thoracico-abdominal cavity, and ' extending into the neck and 
beneath the skin of the breast and abdomen. From the carcass, 
Beventy-two worms were obtained, of which two-thirds were 
females ranging from 90 to 120 mm. in length; the rest males, 
ranging from 4n to 55 nun. From the abdomen of another bird, 
Dr. Warren obtained five worms, three females from 55 to 90 
mm., and i wo males, 40 and 55 mm. In twenty-two birds examined 
b\ Dr. Warren, the parasites were found only in the two indicated. 
Flic worms appear to be the Filaria obtusa Rudolphi, wdiich 
infests the Hirundo rvstica, and other species of European Swal- 
lows. The worms of the Snow Bird reach double the length of 
those of the Swallows, but in other characters agree with the 
descriptions of F. obtusa, as given by Diesing and Dujardin, and 
also with the figures given by the latter (Hist. Helminthes, pi. 
iii). except that it is uncertain as to the existence in our speci- 
mens of the buccal armature represented b} r Dujardin. The 
worms are translucent white, with a chocolate-brown intestine 
and white uteri and testes. The caudal extremity is obtuse, 
without appendages, and in the male possesses two spicules, of 
which the longer curved one is F125 mm. long, and the shorter 
twisted one 0*5 mm. long. The ova, containing developed 
embryos, are 0*045 mm. long and 0032 mm. broad. 

Six other specimens, apparently also pertaining to Filaria 
obtusa, Dr. Warren obtained from the abdominal cavity partly 
imbedded in the wall, of a Meadow Lark, Sturnella magna. Two 
are females, 130 and 140 mm. long by 0'625 mm. thick ; and four 
are males, from 50 to 60 mm. long by 0\5 mm. thick. 

Six specimens of another Filaria were obtained from the 
abdomen of a female Kingfisher, Geryle alcyoa. The species 
appears to be the Filaria physalura of Bremser, described from 
specimens obtained from several species of Brazilian Kingfishers. 
Five of the worms are females, ranging from one foot to one foot 
and a half in length, and from one to one and a half millimetres 
in thickness. The head is obtuse, and the body gradualby tapers 
to the tail. The mouth is bounded by a t pair of small conical 
papillae. The five females measure, respectively, 12, 13, 14, 17, 
and 18 inches. A single male is 35 mm. long by 0*625 mm. thick. 
The tail is incurved, ends in a minute blunt cone, and is bialate, 
with the alee short and quinquecostate. The length of the alated 
portion is 0-35 mm. The spicule, partially exserted, is recurved. 
The specimens, when alive, were pink in color, and exhibited a 
slender chocolate-brown intestine, with large tortuous white uteri. 

From the thoracic cavity of a Gray Snipe, Gallinaqo Wilsoni, 
Dr. Warren obtained five Flukes, 18 mm. long, by 4 mm. broad. 
These appear to be Mono&tomum. mutabile. 

Prom a Whippoorwill, Antrostomus vociferus, Dr. Warren 
obtained four worms, two females of 18 mm., and two males of 
12 mm., which appear to be Ascaris subulata. 




From the Pileated Woodpecker, Hylotomus pileatus, Dr. War- 
ren obtained ten worms, which appear to pertain to the Spiroptera 
quadriloba Rudolphi, the female of which was originally described 
from specimens found in the Green Woodpecker, Picus viridis. 
The specimens are reported as having been found in the abdomi- 
nal cavity. Six are females from 9 to 12 mm. long by 0*5 mm. 
thick, and four males 7 and 8 mm. long by 0"375 mm. thick. 
Body white, nearly equally attenuated towards both ends; trans- 
versely wrinkled, and anteriorly minutety, regularly and sharply 
annulated ; mouth quadrilobate. Tail of female conical subacute ; 
tail of male bialate, sexcostate, end acute ; spicules two, the 
longest 1*5 mm. long, the shortest - 5 mm. long. 

The following were ordered to be printed : — 






ON THE AMERICAN 8PECIE8 OF THE GENUS UMBRA. 
BY WILLIS 8. BLATCHLEY. 

I have compared numerous specimens of mud-minnows (Umbra 
Miiller), from different parts of the United States, with a view of 
ascertaining whether more than one species exists in our waters. 
I find, as already noted by Jordan and Bean, two types ; the one 
(limi) inhabiting the waters of the great lake region and north- 
westwardly ; the other (pygrtidea), inhabiting the coastwise 
streams from Connecticut to North Carolina. 

On careful comparison, the only constant difference between 
these forms, which I am able to appreciate, is the coloration. 

The true Umbra limi is dull olive-green in color, with about 
fourteen narrow, pale, transverse stripes, often obscure in the 
young ; dark bar at base of caudal much less distinct, and lower 
jaw always paler than in pygmaea. 

The eastern form, which I regard as a geographical subspecies 
( Umbra limi pygmaea), is much darker in color, with about twelve 
pale, narrow longitudinal instead of transverse stripes, the one 
beginning at upper angle of opercle being double the width of the 
others ; dark bar at base of caudal very distinct, extending over 
l£ scales ; lower jaw dark, almost black in adults. 

The following is the synonymy of each of the two forms : —
