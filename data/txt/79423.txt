PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



ON MOSCHITES VERRUCOSA < Verrill) AND ITS ALLIES. 

 BY S. STILLMAN BERRY. 



Striking instances of anomalous distribution of Cephalopoda are 

 not frequently encountered during a perusal of the literature, espe- 

 cially among the less active, bottom-loving forms, most of which, 

 so far as known, are prone to inhabit each its o\mi definitely circum- 

 scribed district or faunal area. It therefore becomes of especial 

 importance to subject such apparent exceptions as we tlo find to the 

 most careful scrutiny, to ascertain whether they really exist, and 

 then, if they seem so to do, to discover a reason. One of the most 

 interesting and frequently quoted cases of this sort is that of Verrill's 

 Moschites [ = Eledone] verrucosa, originally described from 466-810 

 fathoms, off the coa.st of southern New England, again reported from 

 considerably deeper water off Delaware Bay, and since recorded frt)m 

 630 fathoms off the Kermadec Islands, and from 1,020 fathoms in 

 the Gulf of Panama by Hoyle (1886, 1904). 



^o far as we know now, the Atlantic recortls for verrucosa are 

 unimpeachable, and in any case they fail to offer such zoogeographic 

 peculiarities that they need concern us here. That the case with 

 the Pacific citations is altogether otherwise, it is the aim of the 

 present paper to show. 



The first of these is based upon a single male specimen taken by 

 tlie Challenger ExjM'dition in 1874, reported upon by Hoyle in 1886, 

 and now preserved in the British Museum (Natural History) at 

 South Kensington. Though Hoyle's remarks are brief (1886, 

 J). 104), they show thai he fully appreciated not only the .specimen, 

 but the peculiar interest which his identification gave to it. He 

 wrote vmder '' Eledone verrucosa" as follows: 



"The agreement betw<'en the Challenger speciiiun and the 

 a<lmirablo drawings and description of Professor \'errill is .so clo.se 

 that there can be no doubt as to the correctness of this identification. 

 The only diffen'nees appear to be that in the .\merican specimens 

 the cirri round and above the eyes are a little more prominent than 

 in that from the Pacific, while the latter has the extremity of the 

 hect<icolylized arm formed like that of an Octopus rather than like 

 that of an Klcdone, a.s shown in N'errill's figure. The Challenger

specimen, moreover, has the second pair of arms the longe.«^t, lie 

 first come next, while the third and fourtli are subeciual and still a 

 little shorter; but as appears from Verrill's measurements {loc. at.), 

 these proportions are liable to variation. 



''The point of greatest interest in connection with this specimen 

 is its capture so far away from the original habitat of the species, 

 but this, as will appear in the sequel, is not without |)arallel (see 

 p. '223)." 



Believing that Hoyle's own notes, more particularly the observa- 

 tions on the hectocotylus, are a self-evident disproof of his identifi(:t 

 tion, I recently (191G, p. 49) expressed my dissent from his conclu- 

 sions and proposed the name Moschiles challengeri for the Kermadcc 

 Island species. By way of more (•(>mi)letely estaV)lishing the point 

 in question I have obtained photographs both of the type siXH'imi n 

 of Eledone verrucosa Verrill in the Museum of Comparative Zoology 

 and of the "Challenger" specinn-n which is now the type of M. 

 chaUcnyeri.^ From these it would appear that while the general 

 facies of the two .species is indeed quite similar, the difTerences between 

 them are none the le.ss well marked. At the time the Challengi r 

 report was written, the great im]>ortance of tlie hectocotylus in 

 cla.'^si'fication was not so fully realized as at the i)n'scnt time, but 

 reliance need not be had U])on this alone. The curious stellate 

 tul>erc!es, which occur scattered «)ver the dorsal surface of both forms, 

 and which undoubtedly furnished the principal cause for their 

 confusion, are in the case of M. ihalUiKjrrl much nn)re innnerous. 

 more closely placet!, and have a more general distribution over tho 

 body than in the Atlantic species. Where with M. verrucosa one 

 counts but \'-l or 14 of these tubercles in a line running transversely 

 across the middle of the back, in the Kermadec s|)ecies tin-re aro 

 easily twice as many; and where in rcrrticosa the tuben'Ies extend 

 only slightly past tiie boundary lietween the hea<l and umbrella 

 (.see N'errill's second figure), leaving most of the out«'r surface of the 

 arms and umbn-lla smooth, in M. chuUengeri the tul»<rcN«s exten<l 

 down over the entire upper portion t)f the umbreHa and even well 

 out upon the basal portions of the arms. I think there is no doubl 

 that a direct comparison of the specimens themselves would reveal 

 other and doubtless more far-reacliing difTeren<'es, but tho>o

onumorated above slu)uld be sufficient to prevent a further confusion 

 of the specie>i. 



Miss A. L. Massy lias suggested in correspondence tliat M. chal- 

 lengeri may be identical with the .V. c/mrco^i Joubin of the Antarctic, 

 l)Ut in the absence of better evidence than that afforded by the 

 literature I am unable to arrive at the same conclusion.- 



The remaining Pacific record of verrucosa (Hoyle, 1904, p. 21) is 

 admitted as doubtful by Hoyle because of the inadequate preserva- 

 tion of his material, so I am sure can on a priori grounds be rejected 

 without hesitation. Quite possibly the specimens represent an un- 

 described species. In any case M. verrucosa nmst now be eliminated 

 from our lists of the Pacific fauna. 



Omitting from consiileration the Antarctic members of the genus, 

 Fcveral of which possess stellate tubercles somewhat resembling 

 those of the species described, we arrive at the following summary of 

 this group of Moschites as it has appeared in the literature to date:

 the presumption is that greater knowledge will generally increase 

 rather than diminish the dependable differences.

As the allied Lingiicelapsus Cope has been merged with Ambystoma, 

 it is also likely that the intermediate Chondrotus Cope is also a 

 synonj'iii. 



This salamander is extremely variable in color. The newly 

 developed axalotl is largely dark l)rownish al)ove. from nearly 

 uniform to finely speckled, dotted, spotted or marbled with darker. 

 Some examples show the upper surface largely of uniform tint, 

 though with a number of rather large dusky to blackish spots on the 

 sides, and fewer on the tail (second figure from jjottom). The 

 lower surface of the axalotl is uniform Ijrownish-yellow. The 

 yellow spots then appear and with complete metamorphosis are 

 often quite pronounced. Sometimes the yellowish predominates 

 and the darker brownish becomes black, or the dark color may be 

 of greatest extent. As the yellowish predominates it often leaves 

 the darker color as narrow reticulating irregular lines (fourth figure 

 from bottom). Often along the sides the reticulations may 

 form numerous crowded rounded spots or blotches, fre(|uently 

 variable in size. On the back they are usually not no crowded. 

 As the dark color predominates usually the yellow is restricted rather 

 narrow and regular transverse bands (up])ermost figure). Sometimes 

 some examples appear to retain the dusky ijlotches of the axalotl 

 along with the yellow and dusky markings of the adult (second 

 figure from bottom). We have not seen examples " uniform l)rown 

 above, yellow below, sides darker brown," as mentioned by Cope.' 

 A Mexican example from near Colonia Coreia is remarkable for 

 having a few yellow sp<jts above and but a few along the sides, 

 the dark color greatly predominating. 

 Ambystoma punctatum (Linn6). 



Forty-one examples: New Hampshire (Franconian Notch in

PLETHODONTID^. 



The present state of our knowledge of the genera of this family 

 will not permit us to advance any new rules, though Moore in 

 abolishing the family Desmognathidie renders it imperative that 

 the generic relationships be revised. The value of the characters 

 which can be used must always remain more or less doubtful. Some- 

 times the same character in one group may not be of the same value 

 in limiting the genera as in another. Nevertheless, it appears to 

 us that the boletoid tongue characterizes a very natural group, i.e., 

 Spelerpes and allied genera. All the species of this group of genera 

 display that tendency towards opisthoccrlous vertebrae which led 

 Cope to place Thorius in the Desmognathidae. Most, if not all, 

 have an aquatic larval stage, in some cases, as Spelerpes ruber and 

 Gyrinophilus porphyriticus, of long duration. Separate premaxil- 

 laries compel us to place G. porphyriticus and (ieotriton fuscus at the 

 bottom of the list. These forms are generically sejiarated by the 

 very doubtful character of webbed toes in (kolriton, Spelerpes follows 

 Gyrinophilus, both with free toes, Monculus with only four toes, 

 <E<lipus and (Edipimi with webbed and united digits, respectively, 

 and Thorius with webbed toes and extremely large nostrils. It 

 may be here stated that the young of Geotriton fuscus also have 

 extn-nu'ly large nostrils. Probably further studies may reduce 

 .sf)me of the above to subgenera and even create a new suV)genus 

 for Spelerpes ruber, which seems sufficiently distinct from S. longi- 

 cauduH, the type of the genus. Mnuodus, (Edipus, and (Edipinn 

 may be derived from Spelerpes, which in turn may be derived from 

 Gyrinophilus, probably thrf)Ugh Spelerpes ruber . The direct rela- 

 tions of Thorius and Geolriton are h'ss certain, but that they are 

 closely allied is umpiestionable. Next to the free-tongued group 

 would ramo Stereochilus, a little-known form, which in color and 

 <U*ntition appniaches Spelerpes ruber. The tongue is more free than 

 in any of the other remaining g«'nera. The cranial structure is 

 comparatively tmknown. ("oim's statement that it lacks th<^

premaxillary fontanel and that "in the only skeleton I have examined 

 the prefrontal is present one sick- and wanting on the other" would 

 bring it near Lcurognathus. 



The next group, Desmognathm and Leurognathus, agree in the 

 absence of prefrontals, poorly develoix'd vomerine teeth, and in a 

 peculiar collar on the atlas where the temporal muscles originate. 

 But the absence of a premaxillary fontanel in Leurognathus and the 

 pre.<ience of well-developed vomerine teeth in some male and all 

 female Desmoynnthus prevent us dividing one genus from the other. 

 All the preceding genera have typically aquatic larvae. Desmogna- 

 thus seems to tend towards terrestrialism in that one species lays 

 eggs on land and the aquatic larva of another is unknown and may 

 not exist. Typhlotriton and Autodax stand between this group and 

 the Pldhodon group, but there is some uncertainty as to the actual 

 relations. Both have prefrontals and one ])remaxillary with a 

 fontanel. Autodax is a Pacific-coast form with absolutely terres- 

 trial existence. Tyjdoiriton is a blind cave form from Missouri 

 with an atjuatic larval stage. In both the verteljra? become 

 opisthoccelous with age. Both, according to Cope, have the tem- 

 porals originating; on the atlas. Typfdotritou, whose cranial structure 

 we recently examined, has not the transverse dorsal ridge on the 

 atlas which characterizes Dcwiogtiathus and Leurognathus. Whether 

 Autodax has it is not known, but the tendeney of the temporal 

 muscles to originate on the atlas is acctntuated in these forms, as 

 Cope pointed out. (Icographical probabilities ami life histories 

 .suggest Tjiphlolrllan as next of kin, while the hooked jaw of the 

 most terrestrial species of l)i snintjndllius i^ochrofthtn) would indicate 

 A utudax. 



The next gnjup is I'Ulhodon and its two dcnvativfs. Ilemi- 

 dactylium in the east and Jiatrachoscpa in the west, is, so far :ts known, 

 entirely terrestrial. The vertebra; appear to remain amphiccelous 

 throughout life. Phthodon with two i)remaxillaries stands at the 

 base, lliinidaetylium diH'ers in the loss of a toe, Jiatraehoseps in 

 the loss of prefrontals, the consolidation of the premaxillaries and 

 the loss of a toe. Jhptoyhissn known only from one specimen, has 

 the tongue attached, the toes webbed and opisthocrlous vertebra*. 

 Beyond this it is unknown. Probably it should .stand between 

 Pldhodon and Aut(Hlai. Typhlomolyc is a permanent larva of .s<;me 

 plethodttnt. More cannot be said of its relations other than its 

 affinities are more likely at the aquatic Spelerpes end of the series 

 rather than at the terrestrial Plethodon end. 




14 



PROCEEDlN(;s OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[Jan., 



There are several examples of independent and parallel evolution 

 in these genera. The nu)st obvious is the loss of a toe, which has 

 been undoubtedly indejxMident in the three reduced genera. The 

 loss of the prefrontal in lintrachoseps and the Desmognathus group 

 is another case. The consolitlation of the jiremaxillaries has prc)l)ably 

 been independent, likewise the acquiring of terrestrial habitat. 

 A scheme is here added, followed ]iy a key to the genera, which 

 may show more clearly the relationships as understood by us.

G. porphyriticus, " " " 100+ " " " — " 



.S. ruber and G. porphyriticus are seldom met with in the same locality. 

 The final color pattern of the plethodont salamanders is the result 

 of the gathering of pigment on the sitles of three rows of unpigmented 

 spots. These spots vary with the species in numljer, size and date. 

 In D. fusca the dorsal series is quite large and the two series are 

 confluent at an early age and form the light dorsal area so charac- 

 teristic of the young of that .species. In S. loiigicaudus at 30 mm. 

 (.smallest larva seen), the dorsal areas have merged along the back 

 and the pigment forms a definite lateral line. At this stage the 

 lateral spots are not noticeable. In S. bislineatus at the earliest 

 stage fl7 mm.) the dorsal areas are very noticeable and the others 

 are not evident. Up to the age of about a year (30 mm.) the dorsal 

 areas retain their .shape. As they break up, the lateral arejis ajjpear, 

 and these sometimes la.'<t after transformation. The dorsal areas 

 attract pigment which forms the lateral liiir at transformation. 

 Until transformation, however, this line is much broken and very 

 irregular more resembling a chain than a ban<l. This difference as a 

 chain and a band, connected with the lightness of the dorsal surface, 

 Bcrves to differentiate between this species and .S'. longicnudns. 

 Furthermore, .S, longicaudus has a shorter development than S. 

 bisliurnlus, a.s it i.s a one-year instead of a two-year species. In 

 examples of the Maine size (30 to 10 iimi.) tlic dorsal areas have 




1917.] NATURAL SriEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 17 



completely disappeared in S. longicaudus while they are still quite 

 distinct in S. bislineatus. The dorsal region of S. longicaudus has 

 only a faint stripe down the median line. The larvce of S. bislineatus 

 have the dorsal region either uniform or darker towards the sides. 

 In *S. ruber the dorsal series is formed of a few very small areas, and 

 is only distinct in smaller larva^ (40 mm.). This forms no part in 

 the development of the color-pattern. The lateral series is of many 

 small areas which form a dotted line down the side of the lar\'a. 

 It disappears before transformation, and also plaj's no part in the 

 formation of the adult pattern, or rather the early disappearance 

 of the larval series is responsible for the lack of pattern in S. ruber. 

 The same may be said of G. porphyriticus and D. quadrimaculata. 

 It is interesting to note in this connection that the pattern of D. 

 ochrophea is certainly the result of the development of the dorsal 

 areas from their insignificance in D. quadrimaculata, their late 

 coalescence in IJ. monticohi, their early coalescence in D. fusca, to a 

 coalescence in D. ochrophira, which takes place so early that even in 

 the smallest examples .>^^en no trace of it has been observed. This 

 suggests the al)sence of an aquatic larval stage, and indeed D. 

 ochrophaa is the most terrestrial of the species of Desmognathus. 

 The color pattern of the "red-back" stage of the entirely terrestrial 

 Plethodon erythronutus is almost exactly like that of 1). ochrophoca. 

 The "cinereus" phase is certainly not to be explained in the same 

 way, and the coloration of the species of PUihodon pn-scnts a different 

 proi^lem. It has l>een stated that the tlark pigment underlies the 

 red in P. crythronotus. Now the bleachment and the color pigment 

 (usually red or yellow), in Spekrpcs and iJi.smognathus are distinct, 

 the black i)att('rn ix-ing the result of the change in the larval areas 

 already referred to, while the color pigment appears at transformation 

 and usually is not localized. A possible suggestion of the coloration 

 in the geims PUtlwdon is that the dark color is uniformly over the 

 animal and the color pigment is localized or in scattered spots. 

 Thus there would seem to be no trace in PUlhodon of the influence 

 of any larval areas on the coloration, which wouUl be correlated 

 with the apparent absence of any aquatic larval stage. 



In order to make dear the relations of several recently descriU'd 

 species, and a new sjH'cies of PUtlwdon described later on in these 

 pages, the analysis below is given. Species market! f are restricted 

 to tin- southern Alleghanies and those marked * :ire northeastern

degrees in the vomerine dentition, from extremely obtuse to quite 

 acute, and from widely separated to fairly close together. The color 

 varies from rather light or clear and with small, well-defined, widel>- 

 scattered spots to almost unit-olor, in which spots have run together 

 somewhat, to very thickly well-defined, prominent large spots cover- 

 ing the whole upper surface. A larva from Roan Mountain, Tennes- 

 .<ee, of uncertain determination, differs in the presence of a narrow 

 dark vertebral line. The example from Henderson County, North 

 Carolina, has a long tail and lacks the black spot on the head. The 

 specimen from Auburn, Alabama, in common with the type of 

 P. flatnssi7mts, and the Henderson County specimen, all have the 

 series of teeth very closely approximated in the median line. Further, 

 they have very small scattered spots. The Alabama specimen has 

 the back covered by a dark ground-color, not caused by spots running 

 together. In this it thus differs from the dark color of the usual old 

 of ruber where the spots are very numerous and crowded together. 

 No specimen which could be classed as S. montanus or S. schencki 

 are in the collection. From the descriptions schencki appears a 

 rather local race of ruber. S. montanus appears to be a different 

 matter. Our only approach to the dentition described for montanus 

 is found in the type of P. flavissimus and the two other specimens 

 last mentioned. No approach to the color of montanus has been

 dentition is like that of Plethodon glutinosus. In our .specimens the 

 vomerines extend l)eyond the nares, as they do in P. glutinosus, 

 while in Brimley's figure they are shown just reaching the nares. 

 Tiie dentition of our examples is intermediate between that of 

 P. glutinosus and the species from Pennsylvania we descrilx* as new. 

 The vomerine series are larger in the Koan Mountain specimens than 

 in the Pennsylvania form. l)Ut shorter than in P. glutinosus. Costal

 17, counting axillary and inguinal. Appressed Imibs fail to meet

This new salamander appears to be closely related to P. metcalfi 

 Brimlej', except that it is slimmer and with more costal grooves. 

 It is probably a northern offshoot of that form. Further, it appears 

 isolated, and, with the present state of our knowledge, necessary to 

 admit it as dLstinet. Quite remarkable is the fact that it should 

 have remained so long unnoticed or confused with P. glidviosus. 

 The maximum length of our examples is 139 mm., and the minimum 

 length 44 mm.

Batrachoseps attennatus F^chscholtz. 



Fifty examples from Cahfornia (Russian River, Oakland, San 

 Francisco, Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara). There is considerable 

 variation in this series. Specimens from San Francisco and Santa 

 Barbara are smaller and darker than specimeas from the Russian 

 River and Oakland. The proportions seem about the same, though 

 the tails are longer in the Oakland lot than in any of the others. 



Batrachoseps pacificus (Cope) is said by Van Denburgh^^ to be 

 restricted to the islands off the coast, and thus Santa Barbara is not 

 the tj-pe locality, as he points out very clearly. Our two specimens 

 from Santa Barbara, though in rather poor condition, are certainly 

 not this form, agreeing best with B. attenualus. 



A specimen from Pasadena, California (H. N. Rust), represents 

 B. major Camp. The legs are stouter than in anj' of our large series 

 of B. attenualus. There is also no trace of the lateral stripe usually 

 so prominent in that species.

We cannot see that these two specimens differ in any way from 



small and dark examples of B. attenualus. The fore limb does not 



reach to the angle of the mouth, nmch less "nearly to the orbit," 



and the hind limb extends over only four costal interspaces instead

 was also announced. 



On the unanimous nomination of the Committee on tiie Hayden 

 Memorial (leological Award and with the ai)proval of the Council, 

 the gold Hayden Memorial Medal was conferred on William Morris 

 Davis, Ph.D., Emeritus Professor of (Jeology in Harvanl I'niversity, 

 in reeognition of his distinguished work in geological science. 



\\ II. 1. 1 AM MoKKis Davis was bom in Philadelphia on February 

 12, 18.')(). He was educated at Harvanl liiiversity, where he received 

 the degree of li.S. in 1S()9. He received the honorary degree of 

 Se.D. at the I'niversity of ('ape of ( lood Hope at Cajx' Town in 

 190.'), the degree of Ph.D. at the I'niversity of CIreif.swald in 190(), 

 and the >anie degree at Chri.stiana in 1911. He is a Chevalier de la 

 L<5gion dllonneur. 



l)r. Davis has conducted niany geological investigations, and in 

 his work has travelled widely in tjie t'nited States and foreign coun- 

 tries. His pul»lished writings show a remarkable versatilitv and 




30 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



diversity in scientific interest, for he has become prominent nut only 

 in pure geolog>", but in geography, meteorology' and other allied 

 subjects. 



His early geological efforts were devoted largely to structural 

 geology, as seen in his work in Montana in 1883 and his later work 

 on the Triassic Formation of Connecticut, published by the Unitetl 

 States Cieological Survey. Such researches led him into physiographic 

 geology, which he aptly describes as "the relation of structure, 

 process and stage in determining surface form"; and from physio- 

 graphic geology he branched out into physical geograi:)hy, which in 

 later years has occupied much of his time, and in which he is recog- 

 nized as one of the foremost authorities in the world. His conception 

 of the relation of geolog>' and geography is clearly brought out in 

 his presidential address to the Geological Society of America, 1911-12. 



In the meantime, however, he had not confined himself altogether 

 to geology* and geography. He was assistant at the Argentine 

 National Observatory. Cordoba. Argentina, from 1870 to 1873; 

 while later on at Harvard University he taught at different times 

 geolog}', meteorology and geography. At Harvard he was success- 

 ivelv Assistant 187G-7, Instructor 1878-85, Assistant Profes.sor 

 1885-90, Professor of Physical Geography 1890-99, Sturgis-Hooper 

 Professor of Geology 1899-1912, and Professor Emeritus 1912 to 

 the present time. 



Notwithstanding his many years of teaching at Harvard University, 

 he found time to travel widely and write numerous scientific books 

 and papers. In 1877-78 he toured the world in scientific study; 

 in 1903 he was a meml)er of Pumpelly's Carnegie Institution Expedi- 

 tion to Turkestan; in 1895 he visited South Africa as the guest of 

 the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He was 

 Visiting Pnjfessor at the University of Berlin in 1908-9. and at the 

 Univer-^ity of Paris in 1911-12. 



Among some of the most imjiortant contributions of Dr. Davis 

 to science are his work in structural geology in Montana and Con- 

 necticut, already mentioned; his work on the evolution of form and 

 drainage, as seen in his studies of the Hiver Valleys of Pennsylvania 

 in 1889, the Hivt-r Valleys of Northern New Jersey in 1SS9, the 

 Grand Canyon in ISIM), and the Seine, Meuse, Moselle in 1S9(); his 

 work on the nature of mountain forms, as seen in his studies of the 

 Great Ba.'^in Ranges in 1903 ami in the Turkestan Expedition in 

 1904. Glacial geology, the nature of arid regions in America and 

 Africa, volcantM-s and coral reefs are also subjects on which Dr. Davis 

 has spent much time and thought and jiublished num«'rous ])apers. 



Thus the total contributions of Dr. Davis to s('ienc«> cover a wide 

 field. His numerous text-books relate to varicjus geological ;inil 

 allied subjects and are widely used; his numy papers. meiiKtirs, ami 

 other contributions to scientific lit<>rature include a reinarkabl> 

 broad range of subjects in geology, geograj)hy, meteorology, and 

 allicfl sciences.

OLIGOCENE FOSSILS FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF CARTAGENA, COLOMBIA. 

 WITH NOTES ON SOME HAITIAN SPECIES. 



BY HENRY A. PILSBRY AND AMOS P. BROWN. 



The material de.'^crilied below wa.s collected by Mr. Lloyd B. Smith 

 in 1914, in the course of professional work in the vicinity of Cartagena, 

 chiefly near the so-called "mud volcanoes" and at Cenizas. ]Most 

 or all of them seem to be from Upper Oligocene beds, about equivalent 

 in age to the Gatun in the Canal Zone. 



A few fossils collected by Mr. Smith in the following year in Haiti 

 are also de.scribed. Their chief interest is in adding to the evidence 

 of extensive Oligocene beds south of the main range of the island. 

 The species made known up to this time are not sufficient to fix the 

 position of these beds in the Oligocene series.^ 



When not otherwise specified, the species mentioned are from near 

 Cartagena.

below the shoulder is but slightly convex. The spire is quite low, 

 rising very little above the posterior level of the outer lip. The lip 

 is not very broad, moderately thick, with a slight ledge behind; its 

 inner edge bears about 16 small, unequal teeth. The four columellar 

 folds are about equal, the lower ones being more oblique than in 

 M. laiissimOj and not so strong. 



Length 13.7, diameter 8.7 mm. 



There is also a fragment of a much larger Marginella, not deter- 

 minable. 



Oliva sayana immortua n- subsp. PI. 5, fig. 6. 



The shell differs from the recent 0. saya7m (litterata) by being 

 smaller, less broad at the base, the siitural channel broader and deeper, 

 and the ledge which encircles the shell above the siphonal fasciole 

 is closer to the upper siphonal plait at the edge of the apertural 

 callus. The outer lip is well thickened, indicating maturity. 



Length 41, greatest diameter 18.4 mm. 



Three other specimens are somewhat smaller, but show the same 

 characters. 



Strombina cartagenensis n ap. PI. a, fig. :< 



Tlie sh<'ll is fusiform with a rather long spire of 7J whorls; the 

 earlier ones worn, the later having sculpture of rather narrow, ver>' 

 slightly curved longitudinal ribs, cro.ssed by a group of about 7 

 inconspicuous spirals in the upper part, and strongly developed spiral 

 cords about as wide as their intervals on the lower half of the last 

 whorl, al)out 18 in number. The longitudinal ribs, of which there 

 are 12 on the penultimate whorl, become shorter on the back of the 

 last whorl, where they .scarcely extend to the middle. There is a 

 very thick and high varix Ix'hind tln' outer lip. The aperture is 

 about three-fifths the length of tiie shell, narrow; outer lip heavily 

 callou.sed, the callus bearing about 10 teeth. The columellar lip 

 forms a thin, raised ledge. 



Length 20.8, diameter 11. .'i nun.; lengtii of aperture 1.").2 mm. 



This species differs from the Panamic and .Santo Domingan forms 

 by its rounded periphery, without dorsal or ventral humps.

The .-hell is (juite small, with the greatest width about at the 

 anterior third of the length. Whorls 9, the first three convex, 

 forming the smooth embryonic sIh'II. The remaining whorls of the 

 spire are flat, .sculptured with straight longitudinal ribs about ecjual 

 to their intervals, faint traces of two or three impre.«*sed spiral lines

visible in some of the intervals. The last whorl is convex, iuiving 

 ribs like those of the spire on the front, none on the back, but two 

 precede the small, smooth lip-varix. The intercostal intervals are 

 marked with deeply impressed spiral grooves, obsolete on the crests 

 of the ribs on the front, and on the smooth dorsal patch, but passing 

 over the ribs Ix'hind the lip. The outer lip has a heavy callus within, 

 bearing al)Out 9 teeth, the upper ones stronger. The columella 

 bears a series of 8 teeth. The columellar edge is slightly raised, and 

 there is a very heavy callus upon the body at the posterior commissure 

 of the aperture.

.\ six'cics clo.'^ely related to F. pacificus Sowerby, but differing by 

 the different shape of the last whorl. The coronal tubetcles are 

 situated higher, directed .somewhat upward, and there is no hump 

 on the ba.M- in front of the aperture. The surface is .strongly striate 

 spirally. The inner lip has a di.stinct callous ridge near the po.sterior 

 commissure of the aperture. There are about ten of the i^ointed 

 tubercles on the last whorl. 



This appears to !)»' an ancestor of the recent species, which has 

 more exaggerated sculpture. 

 Tarritella cartageneniis n. Hp. PI. :>, Rk i-'i 



The whorls are nearly flat, but there is a .slight concavity in the 

 upjM'r half and they are a little jirominent below the .suture; the 

 periphery has a rounded prominence, visible above the suture. The 

 light lines of growth are strongly retractive from the upper edge to 

 below the middle of the visible surface of each whorl, then curving 

 and becoming vertical or slightly protractive in the rest of their 

 course. Spiral sculpture of une(|ual, unevenly spaceil threads of 

 various sizes, (hstinct but in Ktw relief. There is a noticeable cingulus

formed by a couple of contiguous threads on a slight elevation, at 

 the lower fourth of the whorls. The base is somewhat convex, and 

 shows four very low, wide spiral welts, with the same finer spirals 

 as the upper surface. The parietal callus is heavy. Length of the 

 fragment figured 47 iniii.: diameter, 24.5 mm. 

 Turritella lloydsmithi n. sp. PI. 5, fig. U. 



This large species has some resemblance to T. gatunensis, the taper 

 being about the same. The whorls are flat except at the periphery 

 (or above the suture) where they bulge a little. This is most marked 

 on the later whorls. The very faint growth-lines are slightly arcuate. 

 Sculpture of about six low spiral cords unevenly spaced, those on the 

 l)ulging lower part being coarser. The base shows about 7 strong 

 spiral cords; over all there is a minute .'sculpture of unequal .spiral 

 threads. The suture is impressed and distinct. A specimen retaining 

 five whorls measures (34.0 mm. long, 23.8 mm. in greatest diameter. 



This species differs from T. subgrundifcra and its allies by the 

 sculpture, and from T. gatunensis by .sculpture and the shape of the 

 whorls, which are not excavated above.

 specifically .seems somewhat doubtful, but the specimens kuduii are 

 smaller.

In the adult stage there are two approximate >i)iral cords, one at, 

 the other above the periphery. Above this there are five .spiral 

 threads, the upper two close together, the others about e(jually 

 spaced. The median part of the whorl is lightly concave, with very 

 strongly arched growth-ridges at wide intervals. Over all there is a 

 minute sculpture of <lightly waved, irregular, sometim«'s anast<unosing 

 striie, spiral and parallel on the lower part of the whorl, converging 

 forward from each growth-ridge on the median part of the whorl. 

 In the young shells, up to over 20 nun. in length, the ridge above 

 th<' suture is acute and strong, the median concavity and the superior 

 convexity are much more marked, and usually some of the median 

 threads are beaded. The largest piece, of about '.i whorls, mea-^ures:

Differs from T. ))icgnlohasis by having the early whorls more 

 elaborately sculptured than the later, not smoother, as in 7ue(jalobasis. 

 It also tapers more gradually. Fig. 7a was inadvertently inverted. 



With the preceding species in the Gabb collection there is one 

 specimen probably referable to T. fueyolobasis, from which it differs 

 only by having the same microscopic sculpture described for T. do- 

 mingensis, and which is not visible on the small specimens of megalo- 

 basis at hand. It tapers much more rapidly than T. dommgensis. 

 Part of a whorl is shown magnified in PI. 5, fig. 14 (the figure in- 

 verted).

 London, vol. XXII, "l866, p. 580, PI. 26, fig. 12 (Cumana, Venezuela, 

 tj^pe loc). 



The Colombian specimens are all fragmentary, but have the 

 typical shape and sculpture. The largest piece, of slightlj' over 

 3 whorls, measures 20 ram. in basal diameter, 41 mm. long. 



This species was also taken bj- W. M. Gabb in Santo Domingo, 

 the specimens smaller, and varying some in sculpture. An ancestral 

 form of T. perattenuata was found with them in the Gabb collection. - 

 T. perattenuata of the Pliocene is clearly distinct from tornata by its 

 much slower taper, though all of the group are closely related. The 

 sculptural development of the series reached its acme in the upper 

 Oligocene when the most highly sculptured species, T. altilira, 

 became extinct. 

 Tarritella calostemma n. sp. PI. .5, 6g. 15. 



The .shell resembles T. altilira Conrad. It is very long and tapers 

 slowly; the whorls are rather narrow, and the suture is not obvious. 

 The growth-lines are deeply arched across the visible part of the 

 whorls. On each whorl there is a high, narrow spiral ridge at the 

 upper fourth, its summit .set with obli(iue tubercles. In the concave 

 interval following there are numerous spiral .stria3 and a slightly

larger beaded central thread. Below the middle there is ii second 

 but narrower spiral ridge, slightly tuberculate, and near the lower 

 edge there is a stronger spiral ridge, with convex, spirally striate, 

 weakly tuberculate summit. The specimens are fragmentary, but 

 indicate a length of at least 75 mm.; diameter of the largest fragment, 

 18 mm. It tapers a little more rapidly than T. altilira. 



Haiti, 20 miles west of Azua. Also from between Las Cahobas ami 

 Thomonde; collected by Mr. Lloyd B. Smith, 1914. 



This species differs from T. altilira by having three major spiral 

 ridges, the lower two nearer together. In altilira and tornata there 

 are but two, and the upper one is sometimes doubled more or less 

 distinctly. In T. calostemma the upper ridge is simple. 



T. calostemma and T. altilira seem to be two lateral branches of 

 the T. tornata stock, highly accelerated in sculpture, reaching their 

 acme and Vjecoming extinct in the upper Oligocene, while descendants 

 of the less specialized tornata stock held on to the Phocene. Its last 

 incarnation, T. perattenuata, shows little advance in sculpture 

 beyond the Oligocene tornata; but it is specialized — probably over- 

 specialized — by its extri'ordinary length and large number of whorls. 



PetalooonchuB domingensis Sowb. 

 Dentalium solidissimam n. sp. PI. 5, fig. s. 



Known by a fragment which tapers rather slowly and is almost 

 circular in section. The shell is very solitl, at the lower breach the 

 walls at IcAst 3 mm. thick. It is sculptured with high ribs slightly 

 narrower than their intervals, their crests and the intervals being 

 rather strongly crenulated by circular stria*. The suprrlicial layer 

 has scaled off in great part, .so that the finer sculpture described may 

 perhaps l>e due to wear. There arc 2S primary ribs, and near the 

 larger end a few small interstitial riUlcts appear. Total length of 

 the fragment, 28.2 mm.; greatest diameter 15.8 nun.; dianicter 

 14 mm. at the smaller end. 



This is probably a Fi,ssidentalium, and from the fragment seems 

 intermediate between candidum and megathyris in taper. 

 Dentalium cartagenenie n. up. PI. .">, fig. 10. 



.\ species of the group of Dentalium di.sparile. Moderately curved, 

 having seven angles, the intervals concave at the smaller, Hat at the 

 larger end. The two intervals bounding the keel on the concave 

 side are wider than the others, and the three forming the curve of 

 the convex side are decidedly narrower than the rest. Inti-rvals 

 have a few longitudinal threads at the smaller end, increasing with 




38 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



growth, so that at the larger end there are 27 cords in all. The 

 growth-lines are inconspicuous. The shell is broken more or less at 

 both ends. 



Length 19.4 mm.; antero-posterior diameter at larger end 3.7; 

 lateral diameter 3.9 mm.; lateral diameter at smaller end 2.4 mm. 



Pitar Hysteroconcha casta n sp. PI. (i, Ak. 4 



The shell is oblong with small, rather plump beaks. Sculpture 

 of continuous, smooth concentric ridges, their edges overhanging the 

 succeeding intervals a little, and some of them broadened into 

 lamellae at the anterior entl. They are not enlarged or interrupted 

 posteriorly, and there are no spines. Between the concentric ridges 

 there are fine growth-lines, some of them larger. thread-lik<'. Lunule 

 defined by a groove, radially striate. Interior not seen. Length 

 about 26 mm.; height 19 mm.; semidiameter 6 mm. 



The sole specimen is partially imbedded in material too hard to 

 be removed, so that the internal characters and posterior end could 

 not be examined. The sculpture, however, is very perfectly pre- 

 served and characteristic, and leaves very little doubt that the shell 

 is related to the recent P. dione (L.). The absence of .spines would 

 be expected in an early member of the group. The concentric 

 lamellae are developed less than in P. dione, and turn downwards at 

 the edge. In contour P. casta stands nearer to P. lupanaria. 



Toldia pisciformis n. sp. PI. fi. fig. 3. 



The shell is much lengthened, the posterior part decidedly atten- 

 uated (end broken), anterior end rounded. Surface nearly smooth, 

 but under a lens showing delicate, rather close grooves in harmonj' 

 with growth-lines, from the middle downward. A pair of extremely 

 low ribs run in a low curve from the beaks to the anterior-l)asal 

 margin. The teeth are very lujmerous, and appear to be about 

 equally so before and behind the beaks. 



Length, as i)roken. oO mm.; height 22.0 mm.; diameter 10. S mm. 



This is much broader than )'. Umatida Say, with a sinuation in the

 beaks. Sculpture (tf many (about 55) extremely low radial ribs, 

 Homewhat wider tli:iii their intervals, and weak, coarse gidwth-lines. 




1917.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 39 



The convexity of the ribs is, in fact, barelj' perceptible, though they 

 are perfectly obvious to the eye. Where erorled ciuite superficially, 

 the ribs are reduced to flat spaces Ijetween slightly raised radii of 

 half their width, representing the intervals. With further erosion 

 the ribs are transformed into slightly concave radii with the edges a 

 little raised, and separated by very narrow, de(^ply l)itten crevices 

 occupying the middle of the original intercostal valleys. With 

 further etching, the edges of the original ril)s become more prominent, 

 the middle being eaten out, so that the effect is an even radial striation. 

 The basal margin is strongly toothed within. The cardinal area is 

 moderately wide. Teeth not examined. Height 44.4. diam. 32 mm.: 

 length about 42 mm. 



This species resembles G. gigantea Reeve of the west coast, and also 

 G. jamaicensis Dall, of the Bowden bed! It differs from both in 

 wanting very minute radial striie. 



Glyoymeris trilobioosta n. »p. PI. 6. fig. 5. 



The shell is compre.s.sed, equilateral, with small beaks; rather 

 thick. Sculpture of about 32 radial ribs, the small ones at the ends 

 simple, the rest l)race-shaped ('—'—-), their interstices narrow grooves; 

 towarils the beaks the cro.ss-section becomes simpler, the ribs at 

 first being convex. Over the ribs there is a very regular, close 

 sculpture of minute concentric threads. The ba.sal margin is toothed 

 within, as usual. Cardinal area small, having about 3 V-shaped 

 grooves. Teeth 12 on each side, rather long, smooth-sided, those of 

 the median part a little bent angularly. 



Height 14. G, length 14.5, semidiameter 4 mm. 



The peculiar form of the ribs and the beautiful concentric sculpture 

 over them are the chief characters of this species. 

 Olycymeris Uoydsmithi n. up. PI. (5. fig. 6. 



The shell is moderately conv(>x, slightly ineriuilateral. the margins 

 somewhat straightened on both sides of the umbo. Sculpture of 

 about 27 very low, broad, rounded rii)s, rapidly becoming weaker 

 towards the base, faint on the anterior end, which is bisected by an 

 indistinct radial angulation, as in (i. jamainnsi.s and some recent 

 Antillean si)ecie8. No secondary radial striation can l>e .seen. The 

 cardinal an'a is very small, not grooved. There are 11 teeth before 

 and 12 b«'liind the beaks; most of the posterior teeth and a few of the 

 anterior being angularly bent. The articulating faces of all of the 

 teeth have very minute striation vertical to the to()th. The lower 

 half of the inn«'r margin of the shell shows about 20 prominences of 

 the usual form. 




40 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb.;. 



Height 29.2, length 28, semidiaraeter 9 mm. 



The ribs weaken rapidly towards the base, where they almost 

 disappear, reminding one of G. subovata (Saj'). G. jainaicensis Dall 

 differs by its greater length, much less arched hinge line and fine 

 striation. 



Ostrea vaaghani insularis n. subsp. PI. C, figs, l, la. 



The common largo oyster of Santo Domingo resembles 0. vaiighani, 

 as described and figured by Dall, except in the following features: 

 The beak is usually straight; the upper valve is verj- much smoother 

 than the lower, marked with growth-lines only, and it is usually 

 almost flat. The lower valve is thick, coarsely lamellar, not fluted, 

 and has a rather deep beak cavity. The valves have a sparse 

 denticulation inside near the hinge. Length of lower valve 106,^ 

 width 58 mm. It may perhaps be well to signalize these differences 

 by a subspecific name. 



Santo Domingo, W. ^I. Gabb. No. 2635, A. N. 8. P. 



Ostrea cahobasensis n sp. PI. 6. fig. 8. 



This oyster is similar to the preceding except that in a large 

 series of specimens none were found to have the inner margins of the 

 valves denticulate near the hinge. The upper valve is nearly flat 

 and is perhaps somewhat rougher than in insularis. Length 85 mm. 

 It often reaches a nmch larger size, length 190 mm. or more.

Oitrea tonlptarata osoulnm n. subsp. PI. 6, fiRs. 2, 2a. 



A small oyster of rounded or subtriangular shape, nearly equilateral. 

 The umbonal half is more or less obviously cuneate in outline, with 

 crenulated submargins; the opposite (basal) border is broadly rounded 

 and extremely sinuous, typically having two deep, angular plications 

 in each valve. The lower valve has a very shallow heak-cavity, the 

 flatter upper valve none. The adductor impres.sion is strongly 

 lateral in position. Beaks are rather short and oblique, nearly (Mjual 

 in the two valves. Length 42.5, width 39, diam. 37 mm. 



Some examples are flatter, with le.ss emphatic and fewer plications. 

 It is certainly not identical with the recent (). mcgodon. It differs 

 from 0. Hculplurnla by the reduced number and large size of the folds.

NOTES ON THE ANATOMY OF OREOHELIX. II. 

 BT HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



The following notes supplement those contained in these Proceed- 

 ings for 1916, pp. 34Q-359. With one exception they deal with 

 material collected by Professor Junius Henderson and Mr. L. E. 

 Daniels in Utah and Idaho, in 1916. A single species taken by 

 Mr. Ferriss in southern Nevada is also included. 



Oreohelix haydeni and subspecies. Fig. 1. 



The typical form has not been rediscovered, but it is not likely to 

 differ materiallj' in genitalia from the numerous forms of the species 

 already dissected. The several subspecies are much alike in soft 

 anatomy; the chief differentiation has been in the shells. The 

 researches of Messrs. Henderson and Daniels in 1916 have added 

 materially to our resources, particularly in northeastern Utah.

HUNTING MOLLUSCA IN UTAH AND IDAHO IN 1916. 

 BY JUNIUS HENDERSON AND L. E. DANIELS. 



We were in Utah and southern Idaho from June 10 to July 24, 

 1916, continuing the work begun in 1915.^ ]More attention was 

 given to fresh-water species and the smaller land snails than before, 

 with some interesting results. A vast amount of work remains to be 

 done in this region before the molluscan faunas and the significance 

 of their present distribution are thoroughly understood. 



The known Tertiarj' and Pleistocene history of the Salt Lake 

 Basin is such that it must vitally affect the present distribution of 

 species, as well as possibly influencing local variations. Great Salt 

 Lake and L^tah Lake, both within the area covered by this report, 

 are among the remnants of a much larger ])ody of water known to 

 geologists as ancient Lake Bonneville. During Pleistocene time it 

 extended over a large part of Utah and into Idaho, with a depth of 

 hundreds of feet. In its retreat it left a fine series of terraces around 

 the margin of its basin to mark the various stages of its recession. 

 The formations deposited beneath the waters of the ancient lake, 

 the fluctuations of its water level, and its molluscan life as revealed 

 by the numerous fossils contained in the lacustrine tleposits have 

 been subjects of extensive investigation and discussion.- 



The aridity of the vast area between the Rocky Mountains and 

 the Sierra doui^tless dates well back into Pliocene time. The changes 

 in the water level in the various lake basins do not necessarily iin])ly 

 periods of great humiditj'. Each receives the drainage of a large 

 territorj', and being completely land-locked, a slight increase in the 

 precipitation for a short cycle may extend the borders of the lakes 

 far out over th«! flat, low-lying area around the lake margins, and 

 increased precii)itati<jn for a longer ])erio(l may fill the basins to 

 overflowing. The rise and fall of the waters of land-locked lakes 

 constitute a complete and accurate record of the net result of all the

climatic factors, chief of which are precipitation and temperature, 

 evaporation being an expre.'^.sion of the relations of temperature to 

 humidity. Even within the short period of occupation by the white 

 race, notable changes in the area of Great Salt Lake and other lakes 

 of the region have been recorded, but these changes have been 

 insignificant when compared with those shown by the geological 

 record. In Pleistocene time there were at least two periods of 

 enormous exjiansion and contraction. During those expansions the 

 Oquirrh and some of the other mountain ranges were peninsulas 

 projecting far out into the lake, while the southern part of Promontory 

 Range and many other small ranges were islands. Thus during 

 the periods of great extension the ilirect interconnnunication of the 

 land-snail faunas of the several mountain ranges was either partially 

 or wholly prevented by the intervening waters. During the recession 

 periods l)etween the major expansions, as well as during the long 

 periods before the first expansion and after the last contraction, 

 many of these mountain areas were nearly as well insulated by wide 

 expanses of territory apparently quite unfavorable to land snails, 

 especially the larger snails of the genus Oreohelix. It is well to note, 

 however, that as work upon this genus progresses, flourishing colonies 

 of the living snails arc found from time to time in unexpected places, 

 where the cover does not seem at all good. It should also be kept 

 in mind that very few of the isolated mountain ranges have been 

 explored at all, and none of them thoroughly exi)lore(l, bj' concholo- 

 gists. Hence the last word on this jihase of the subject cannot be 

 written, even aside- from the possibility of the accidental trans- 

 portation of snails by birds and other agencies. Turning now to the 

 fresh-water mollusks, direct intercommunication of the faunas of 

 such streams as the Bear Hiver, flowing into (ireat Salt Lake from 

 the north, and the Jorilan, entering from the south, has been pre- 

 vented ever since the last contraction of Lake Bonneville by the 

 extremely saliiu' waters of the lake, which form a complete barrier, 

 as effectual as a land barrier. This salinity is due to the fact that 

 the lake is land-locked. The streams pour their waters, containing 

 salts dissolved from the soil and rocks, into the lake. There, in the 

 absence of an outlet, the loss is wholly by eva|)oration, which leaves 

 the salts in the water, thus maintaining a concentrated solution, 

 while I'tah Lake, Bear Lake and others with outlets remain fresh. 

 However, during what is known as the "Lake Epoch," Lake Bonne- 

 ville once or twice reached such tlepth that it establishe<l an outlet 

 at tin- north end of the ("ache \:illev in Llaho, resulting in the 

 I

temporary freshening of the water. Hence it is not surprising that 

 certain strata in the lacustrine deposits contain numerous fossil 

 shells. Nearly all the species in this fossil fauna are still found 

 living in some part of the Bonneville Basin, as was long ago pointed 

 out by Call and Gilbert. The drainage during the overflow period 

 also afforded communication l)etween the various rivers of the l)asin 

 and the Port Xeuf River to the north, thus easily explaining the 

 observed similarity in their faunas. 



Our work in the region has developed a peculiar and as yet unsolved 

 problem in the breeding habits of the genus Oreohelix. The genus 

 is viviparous. In 1915 the snails of the genus collected iii the last 

 week in August contained many embryos, but those obtained after 

 the first two or three days in September contained few or none. 

 In 1916 we found very few embryos during the months we were in 

 the field, June and July, yet if the embryos were to be so fully devel- 

 oped h\ the last of August as to be all gone early in September, as 

 in 1915, it seems that they should have been developing by the 

 middle of July. To add to our perplexity, a considerable number 

 of live snails which w'ere found among the dead shells in cleaning 

 them in November and December, nearly all contained embryos 

 of I5 or 2 whorls. These must have developed after July while the 

 snails were dormant. 



Over a large portion of the region covered by this report, the 

 comh)ined effects of brush fires and overgrazing, with the consequent 

 erosion, have played sad havoc with the cover for land snails. In 

 some places where the steep slopes below clumps of bushes were 

 almost white with bleached Oreohelix shells, the washing of the soil 

 and dead leaves from beneath the shrubs had totally destroyed the 

 cover, .'^o that not a living snail could be found, and the shrubs 

 themselves must die as erosion continues to take the soil away from 

 the roots. 



We have continued our station nuiiilxTs from the 1915 exjiedition, 

 and revisited several of the 1915 stations to ol)tain more material 

 and data. We also include in this report some material obtained 

 by Daniels in 1915 at Idaho Falls. Dubois. McC'amnKm, and Weston, 

 but not hitlnTto recorded, together with some unrecorded material 

 in the I'niversity of Colorado Mus«uiii, in order to keej) all our 

 I'tah and Idaho records togetlM-r. 



We gratefully aekiiowjedge the assistanct- of several who have 

 aided in the determination of diffi«Milt material. The Sph;erii(he 

 were examined by Dr. V. St<'rki. Dr. I'ryant Walker has identified

or confirmed the identifications of the Physas and LymiiiEas, as well 

 as some of the other fresh-water snails. Dr. H. A. Pilshry has 

 determined many of the smaller and more difficult lantl snails and 

 has examined both shells and soft anatomy of the Oreohclices. The 

 Physas and Sphseriidse of the region are not well untlerstood and 

 difficult at the best. Hence many of the determinations must be 

 considered tentative. In a number of instances, also, the material 

 is in poor condition for tletermination. 



Rupert, Idaho. 



The following species in the University of Colorado Museum were 

 collected l)y Mr. Fayre Keneg>-, along the Snake River, near Rupert, 

 in 1913: 



Pisidium sp. Lymncea near traskii Tryon. 



Sphieriuin sp. Fhysa sp.

 Oregon, but did not figure it. If, as we suspect and as Dr. Pil.sbry 

 (Mss.) concluded some years ago, these names are synonyms, 7iut-

 should l>e changed to nuUaUli Lea. 



The Spharium from Idaho Falls and the McCammon stations are 

 doubtfullj' referred to S. aureum Prime by Sterki. The beaks of 

 the McCammon examples are less elevated than the beaks of the 

 Idaho Falls material. 



The type locality of Lymncea hinkleyi Baker is the North Fork 

 of Snake River, eastern Idaho, and therefore must be not far north 

 or northea.st of Idaho Falls. The type locality of Lymncca jack- 

 sanensis Baker is Jackson Lake, Wyoming, which is drained by the 

 South Fork of Snake River, and the species is also recorded from 

 Snake River, Baker, in his monograph, records LymncEa apicina 

 solida Lea from Salmon River, Idaho. 



Dubois, Idaho. 



In August, 1915, Daniels collected the following species in Beaver 

 Creek, at Dubois: 



Pisidium compressum Prime. Lymnoea proxima Lea. 



Pisidium sp. Physa sparsestriata Try on? 



Lymnaa hitmilis rustica Lea. 



The McCammon, Idaho, District. 



We revisited stations 1, 1^ and 2, of 1915, and also established 

 several other stations. 



Sta. 1, west side of Port Xeuf River, about a mile north of McCam- 

 mon. Oreohelix cooperi (W. G. B.) is very abundant under wikl 

 cherrj', wild rose and various shrubs, among large blocks of lava at 

 the foot of a low bluff. Pyrnrniduln cronkhitci anthonyi Pils., three 

 dead shells. On the banks of the near-bj- slough we found Lyjiincca 

 proxima Lea, Pisidium (Sterki says P. hiiachucanum Pils., compare 

 al.^o P. ashmuni), and Physn nmpnllncea did. In 1915 at this place 

 Daniels found a few Succinca, doubtfully identified at the time by 

 Walker a.s »S'. oregonensis gabbi Tryon. Pilsbry .says: "It is not 

 gabbi. Just what it is I do not know. Has the microscopic sculp- 

 ture of atretchiana, but seems too big and too long. With a good 

 series one might come to some conclu.sion. " 



Sta. 62, Port Neuf River, east of Sta. L Sphcerium near aureiim 



•Pbot. Acad. Nat. Sf;i. Puila., XVI, p. 116, 1864. 




1917.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 53 



Prime and Fluminicola fusca (Hald.), both abundant, one example of 

 Physa identified by Walker as P. ampullacea, var. close to propinqua. 

 Sta. I5, about ten miles above McCammon, on south side of Port 

 Neuf River, north side of gulch on east side of mountain about three 

 miles south of west from Lava Hot Springs. 



Oreohelix tenuistriata H. and D. 



This is the type locality of the species, the description of which 

 was based upon three imperfect and immature examples. We 

 revisited the station, where a search of several hours resulted in 

 obtaining about thirty specimens alive, -mostly immature, and twice 

 as many dead shells, under shrubs and mats of the radical leaves of 

 Balsamorrhiza sagittala (Xutt.), overhanging small piles of limestone, 

 in open spaces among the mountain mahoganies, which are here the 

 largest we have seen. The dense blanket of small leaves directly 

 under the mahoganies is not favorable to the snails. This material 

 shows that the species is a larger, finer one than was indicated by the 

 tj-pe and co-t>TDes, and compels an amendment of the description, 

 as follows: Shell rather depressed to moderately elevated; whorls 

 5, convex, carinated almost to the aperture; color very light brown, 

 with two almost undiscernible darker .spiral bands, one well above, 

 the other scarcely below, the iK'rij)hery. The spiral riblets on the 

 best specimeiLS, especially bleached ones, may be seen with the 

 unaided eye. The two largest examples measured are each 13.5 nun. 

 in major diameter, and one is 8 nun., the other 9.5 mm. in altitude. 

 Otherwise the original description holds good. The beautiful 

 sculpture distinguishes it from all other species of the genus we have 

 examined. Pilsbry writes that in genitalia this species is of the 

 haydeni type. 



In the gulch hottom. just hclow the Oreoheliz .slope, among a.spen.s 

 and mountain mapU-s, we obtained Vitrina alaskann Dall. Zonitoides 

 arborea Say, V<illoiun cyclophorclla Ancey and lutconulu.s fulvus 

 ala.'ikensis Pilsbry.

54 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



It is probable that the Sphoorhnn and the Fluminicola may be 

 found in favorable situations all along the stream, and the former 

 wxs noted as a fossil in the alluvial banks of the river at several 

 places. 



Sta. 2, south side of Harkness Canyon, at the springs near a great 

 white clifY plainly visible from McCammon. The large, heavy- 

 shelled Oreohelix strigosa depressa (Ckll.), noted for this station in 

 our former report, occurs in limestone slides on a steep slope almost 

 concealed by a heavy cover of conifers, with an undergro^^'th of 

 mountain maples and various shrubs. A conifer forest is an unusual 

 habitat for such a fine colony of Oreohelix. In the bottomland 

 below the slides we found dead shells of Thijsanophora ingersolU 

 (Bland) plentiful in fine drift wood, and a short distance down the 

 canyon we obtained Euconidus fidvus alasken.sis Pils., Zonitoides 

 arborea (Say), Vitrina alaskana Dall and Vallonia cijclophorella Ancey. 



Sta. 65, east side of gulch coming into Harkness Canyon from the 

 north, above Sta. 2. Large Oreohelix strigosa depressa (Ckll.) 

 abundant, in more open, cleaner slides than at Sta. 2, with few trees 

 and much less shrubbery and herbage. 



Sta. 66, Goodenough Canyon, on east side of a mountain range 

 about five miles west of McCammon. We drove to the end of the 

 road up the canyon, then walked a mile further. Found no lime- 

 .stone, no good rock slides and no Oreohelix, but under leaves and 

 sticks we obtained the following: 



Zonitoides arborea (Say). Euconulus fidnis alaskensis Pils. 



Pyramidu'a cronkhitei anthonyi Punclum n. sp. 



Pils. Vertigo modesta par ie talis 



Vitrina alaskana Dall. (Ancey). 



Thysanophora ingersolU (Bland). 



Bear Lake Valley Idaho and Utah. 



Bear Lake, at an altitude of 5,025 feet, is about nineteen miles 

 long (north to .south) and from six to eight miles in width, bisected 

 by the Utah-Idaho boundary line. It is bounded, on the ea.st, west 

 and south by mountains, but the broad valley extends to the north- 

 ward beyond Montpelier to Bennington, thus giving the valley a 

 length of forty miles, drained by the Bear River, which flows into 

 Great Salt Lake. In the Cieologic Atlas of the United States (United 

 States Cleo'ogical Survey) the region is covered by the Montpelier 

 (Idaho) and Randolph (Utah) Quadrangle sheets. We did not visit 

 the ea.stern or southern shores of the lake, but spent half a day at 




1917.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 55 



the northern end and e.xamined the western shore at various places. 

 We found no living moUusks in the lake itself. This may be due to 

 the fact that the water was considerably above the usual level and we 

 were not prepared for dredging. The sloughs and streams of the 

 valley furnished quite a number of species of fresh-water moUusks 

 alive, and the mountains and canyoas bordering the valley yielded 

 land snails. 



Sta. 67, just within the mouth of Montpelier Canyon, northwest 

 of Montpelier, Idaho, on the south side of the canyon. Oreohelix 

 cooperi (W. G. B.) abundant, mostly innnature, under shrubber}' on 

 slope beneath a limestone ledge almost devoid of rock slides. Al- 

 though the snow from a two days' storm (June 20-21) was just 

 melting, on June 22 the snails were all a.ctive and hence easy to find. 

 Mature examples from this station measure about 20 mm. in diameter. 

 Viirina alaskana Dall was noted on a ditch bank. This Vitrina we 

 found at almost every station where we found Oreohelix, but we did 

 not always collect it and perhaps in some instances failed to record 

 it in the notebook. 



Sta. 68, three miles up Montpelier Canyon, on th«' north side of a 

 ravine that comes in from the east. Oreohelix cooperi (W. G. B.) 

 plentiful, nearly all mature, in limestone rock slides, mature examples 

 varying from 17 mm. to 21.5 mm. in diameter, mostly al)out 20 nmi. 



Sta. 69, south side of the same gulch, op|)osite Sta. 68 and not 

 more than 150 feet distant. Oreohelix cooperi (W. G. B.), live 

 examples scarce, dead shells plentiful, under shrubbery on a limestone 

 slope devoid of rock slides. Though separate(l from Sta. 69 only by 

 the narrow bed of the gulch and with the more favorable north 

 exposure, the snails here are much smaller, the shells varying from 

 13.5 mm. to 15.5 mm. in diameter. Lack of cover does not appear 

 to be the cau.se of the tliflference in size, as the cover at Sta. 67 is 

 about the same. 



Sta. 70. canyon about two miles north of Montpelier. Oreohelix 

 cooperi (W. G. B.), of fair size, l)Ut not |)lentiful, in edges of limestone 

 slides. 



Sta. 71. a short distance up Beimington Canyon, east of Benning- 

 ton (north of Montpelier). Oreohelix cooperi (W. CJ. B.), large, 

 robust, very ai)un<lant under shrui)bery. especially wild roses, on 

 steep banks of creek, active among the tiny patches of snow remaining 

 from the late .storm. None found in the big sandstone slides on the 

 .slope above the brush and trees of the narrow Imttomland. 



Sta. 72. sloughs on east side of Hear River, on Itoth sides of the 

 Montpclier-Ovid wagon road. We here obtained the following: 




56 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



Sphccrium sp. Lymncea utahefisis Call. 



Musculium n. sp. Playiorbis trivolvis near binneyi 

 Succinea rusticana Gkl. Tryon. 



Valvata hnmeralis caUfornica Planorbis parvus Say. 



Pils. Planorbis exacuoiis Say. 



Lymticca stagnalis opprcssa Say. Physa ampuUacea Gld. 



Lymncra proxima Lea. Aphxa hypnorum (Limi.). 



The Planorbis trivolvis at all stations in this valley reaches great 

 size — up to 35 mm. in diameter in some instances. They have the 

 strong transver.se sculpture of the variety binneyi, but the whorls 

 are not quite so conspicuously strap-like as those from Sta. 127 at 

 Utah Lake. Caddis larvse cases from one of the sloughs are com- 

 posed almost wholly of Planorbis parvus, P. exacuous and other small 

 shells and shell fragments. Planorbis exacuous was descrilied by 

 Say,^ in 1821, under this name as thus spelled, apparently a poorly 

 formed adjective from exacuo or from acuo, referring to the sharp 

 periphery. It should have been spelled either exacuus or exacutus. 

 Gould,^ in 1841, in.serted the t, saying: 



"I cannot but think that the name under which this shell ajjpears 

 in the 'Journal of the Academy,' is not exactly as it was intended by 

 the author, as it is neither a Latin word nor a Latin termination. 

 Supposing that l)y a typographical error, an o has taken the place 

 of a i, we have a legitimate term, and one very expressive of the 

 form of the shell." 



In his sjTionymy he gives the original spelling. Haldeman, in his 

 monograph, 1842, follows (lould, but in the synonymy he also cites 

 the name as originally published. Unfortunately, Binney,* in 1865, 

 adopting Ccjuld's form of the name, in his synonymy of the species

 As the latter is the work most generally accessible and used for 

 reference, it ha.s misled many subsequent writers. If the original 

 name were clearly a misprint and we could a.scertain just what was 

 intended, the rules of nomenclature would justify its correction. 

 It is conceivaijly, though not likely, a case of poor judgment in the

 of St. Charles, Idaho. June 27, 1916. 



Sta. 78, natural turnpike forming the northern ])arrier of Bear 

 Lake and separating it from Mud Lake and Dingle Swamp. The 

 sandy soil of this broad barrier is in places composed largely of fossil 

 shells of the same species that abound along the beach, leading to the 

 belief that the beach shells have mostly been washed from the sand 

 by the waves and are fossil. Though we found no live moUusks in 

 the lake, many of the shells, especially Lymtuva and Planorhis, were 

 rather fresh, and all were of species that might be expected to now 

 live in the region, though only two or three of the species were actually 

 taken alive in the valley. As the lake is now used to regulate the 

 flow of water in the streams and ditches, the water level fluctuates 

 considerably, and at the time of our visit the water in the lake, as 

 well as in the streams, was high. The beach material yielded the 

 following: 



Sphcerium pilsbryanum Sterki. Valvata idahensis (Call). 



Pisidium compressinn Prime. Planorbis trivohns near hinneiji 

 Pisidium n. sp. Tryon. 



Pyramidida cronkhitei anlhonyi Planorbis parvus Say.

Baker, in his Lynmieidic of North America, records L. proxima 

 also from the Utah end of the lake. L. utahensis at this station is 

 on the average more elongate than those from the type locality at 

 Utah Lake, but on the whole they cannot be separated. Valvata

Sta. 81, three miles up St. Charle.s Canyon, west of St. Charles, 

 Idaho. Oreohelix strigosa depressa (Ckll.) found sparingly in sand- 

 stone slides and about limestone ledges. In the water-cress of a 

 small seepage ehannel from the creek we found: 



Paludestrina longinqua (Gld.). Lytnnoea obrussa Say. 



Physa atnpuUacea Gld. Succinea rusticana Gld. 



Sta. 82, mouth of Garden City Canyon, west of Garden City, 

 Utah, on south side of canyon. Oreohelix haydeni hybrida (Hemph.). 

 typical, as at Logan, common under small shrubs, and especially 

 under the matted radical leaves of Bahamorrhiza sagittaia (Nutt.), 

 on limestone slopes devoid of rock slides. We also found a few 

 Pupilla bUindi (Morse). The slopes are now very barren, but we 

 were informed by pioneers that forty-fiVe years ago thej' were well 

 coveretl with large mountain mahogany, up to a foot in diameter, 

 as at Sta. I5, in the McCammon district. These trees furnished 

 fuel for the early .settlers, but wa.steful cutting and fires have denuded 

 the hills for some miles back, ant! overgrazing by stock has been 

 disa.strous to the smaller shrubs and herbs. It is difficult to believe 

 that snails could obtain a foothold under present conditions, but 

 having flourished here under more favoral)le conditions, they have 

 been able thus far to survive the change in environment. Erosion 

 is rapidly carrying the soil and vegetative debris from l)eneath the 

 .scant shrubl)ery and may soon destroy the colony, unless saved by a 

 .series of years of imrea-sed moisture favoral)le to i^lant growth. 



Sta. 83, south side of next canyon south of Sta. 82 and al)out half 

 a mile distant. Oreohelix cooperi (W. G. B.) abundant, l)ut much 

 smaller than at most localities where we have found this species 

 (diameter 14 nmi. to 15.5 mm.). These specimens agree with tho.se 

 from Eureka, Utah, in their small size and the ab.sence of the color 

 bands from b<'low, many of them having no color bands at all.

 abundant under leaves in clumps of rose bushes, scrub willows, etc. 

 This station, a flat soil area entireh' free from rocks and some distance 

 from ledges, is an unusual site for a fine colony of Oreohelix. The 

 same sp)ecies is common under similar conditions at ]Montrose, 

 Colorado. 



Sta. 99, slough west of Sta. 98, north of wagon road. Lymncea

Weston, Idaho. 



Sta. 59, cliff of igneous rock about three miles northwest of Weston. 

 Though the place from a distance looked like good snail territory, 

 we succeeded in finding only a very few scorched shells which seem 

 to be a small form of Oreohelix strigosa depressa (Ckll.). A year or 

 two before, a fierce fire had swept the mountain, burning the leaves 

 and sticks to the very bottom of the rock slides, but the scarcity of 

 "bones" shows that the snails were not at all plentiful before the 

 fire. We also vi.sited a good-looking mountain southwest of Weston, 

 in the northern edge of Utah, but found no snails there.

The Fr.vnklin District, Idaho and Utah. 



Franklin is only a mile or two north of the .southern boundary of 

 Idaho, due east of Weston. We visited a good-looking hill about 

 four miles northeast of town, where we found the vegetative cover 

 poor and no .snails. 



Sta. 93. dry slope southeast of Franklin, about half way to the 

 ba.se of the mountain, due north of the type locality of Oreohelix 

 haydeni corrugata H. & D. Succinea oregonensis Lea was very 

 abundant among the quartzite and red sandstone boulders thickly 

 strewn over the surface of the gentle slope, sheltered by verj- scant 

 vegetation growing close to the rocks. Tracks of horses and cattle 

 made when the ground is soft after rains hold a little water for a 

 short time after storms, thus insuring periods of activity sufficient 

 to sustain a very prosperous colony of these snails. They were 

 clinging to the rocks and to the soil beneath by means of a glutinous 

 substance which caused the snails to stick to our fingers and tweezers 

 in removing them from the rocks. Dry, membranous ".scars" 

 adhering to the rocks showed former places of attachment during 

 periods of inactivity, reminding one of Sonorella scars. We ol)tained 

 over a thousand specimens alive in a verj' short time on the Idaho 

 side of the l)Oundar>', then found dead shells all along the way across 

 the line into Utah, to the edgo of the mouth of High Creek Canyon; 

 but not realizing at the time that we were cro.ssing the line, we did 

 not look for live examples. 



Sta. 94. small reservoir in shallow ravine north of Sta. 93. Physn

Sta. 95, north side of High Creek Canyon, southea.^t of Sta. 93, 

 just within the moutli of the canyon and continuing some distance 

 up the canyon on the same side. Oreohelix strigosa fragilis (Hemph.) 

 in quart/.ite and red sandstone slides. 



Sta. 90, similar slides a mile or .so up the canyon on the south side, 

 the same subspecies, scarce. Further up the canyon the walls are 

 of limestone, but strange to say our brief .search there did not 

 yield snails. Hemphill states that the type locality of fragilis is 

 "near Franklin, Idaho, among Red Sandstone." The to|K)Kraphy 

 suggests this canyon a.s a very likely one for him to have visited, the 

 other likely (me i)eing two or thn-e miles to the north, a little north 

 of ea.st from Franklin and hence in Idaho. Our stations for this 

 subspecies, 39 (1915), 95 and 90 (1910), are all in Ctah. If Hemp- 

 hill's type locality is any of these three, then the only Idaho station 

 known ior fragilis is Franklin Hutte, west of the town, our Sta. 38, 1915.

Smithfield, Utah. 



Sta. 101. limestone butte about two miles northeast of Smithfield. 

 Oreohelix periphcrica (Ancey), almost devoid of color banils — the 

 binneyi form. A few live snails were found by persistent search, but 

 dead, lileached shells were very abundant on the slopes to the top 

 of the butte, thence to the north slope of the entrance to the canyon 

 to the southeast. The butte has been considerably denuded by 

 overgrazing, and erosion has washed the soil and dead leaves from 

 beneath the shrubs and Balsamorrhiza that formerly afforded shelter 

 for the snails. Bleached shells almost whitened the ground down 

 the slopes from clumps of bushes where now there is no snail cover 

 at all. It is difficult to see how the shrubbery can long continue to 

 exist. As this butte is only six miles south of the Oreohelix haydeni 

 corrugata butte, and the two l)uttes are of the same character, we 

 expected to find that subspecies here, but failed to do so. Three 

 buttes of similar character, placed at intervals of about six miles and 

 almost in line, our stations 38, 40 and 101, yielded respectively 

 0. s. fragilis, 0. h. corrugata and 0. periphcrica. 



We worked up the large canyon southea.st of Sta. 101 for several 

 miles, and were surprised to find no snails in it.

Sta. 86, north fork of Logan Canyon, about sixteen miles from 

 Logan and three miles above "the forks. " Oreohelix siriyosa depressa

 and roots provided clinging places for the snails. We also obtained

Microphysa ingersolli, with three outline figures which do not ade- 

 quately represent the material he collected or any specimens we have 

 seen from Colorado or elsewhere, and the lateral view is mispleading. 

 Binney," in 1878, 1885, 1886 and 1890, again published misleacUng 

 figures, perhaps based upon the original figures. These all represent 

 a shell with ape.x so depressed that it does not show at all above the 

 last whorl in lateral view. In 1887 Ancey,'^ reU'ing upon the supposed 

 accuracy of those misleading figures, as he plainly indicates, and 

 finding that his specimens of Thysanophora collected by Hemphill 

 in Logan Canyon, Utah, exhibited a spire elevated clearly above the 

 last whorl, described it under the name Microphysa ingersolli convcxior. 

 Meanwhile Binney, in his second supplement, in presenting what he 

 said was a better figure of ingersolli, recorded under that name 

 material collected by Hemphill (doubtless part of the same lot of 

 material from which Ancey's types came) at Logan Canyon and 

 Mt. Nebo, Utah, and also Weston, Oregon. We have examined 

 Thysanophoras from two stations in Logan Canyon, a number of 

 other localities in Utah and Idaho antl many localities in Colorado, 

 some of them near the type locality of ingersolli, and can see no 

 difference, none of them being accurately represented by the figures 

 of ingersolli. Specimens from Logan Canyon were sent to Pilsbry, 

 who compared them with IngersoU's specimens of ingersolli. He 

 agrees with us that the names are exact synonyms, ingersolli, of 

 course, having priority. In bS'.H) Professor T. D. A. Cockerell was 

 permitted to examine and copy portions of Ancey's manuscript 

 notes, including notes on his M. i. convexior, with pen and ink figures. 

 We have examined his copies of Ancey's figures, and the one labelled 

 ingersolli represents Binney's misleading figure of the species, while 

 the one hib('ll«'d convexior is an excellent illustration of the shell 

 found in Mcnitana, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and doubt- 

 less Wyoming, and which must take the name ingersolli. It is 

 interesting to note that though Hinney recorded ingersolli from 

 Weston, Oregon, collected by Heinpliill, Pilsbry'"' reccjrdeil and 

 figured specimens from the same place under the name convexior, 

 becaus«' they had the spire considerably higher than material from 

 Colorado and elsewhere. I'his confirms our conclusion that BiiUH-y 

 was really dealing with a form having a slightly raised spire, while

 If further material shows the Oregon form to be worthy a name,

Sta. 87, just within mouth of Logan Canyon, on south side. 

 Oreohelix slrigosa depressa (Ckll.) very abundant, rather small, 

 nearly white, with two conspicuous, usually broad, dark brown bands, 

 which almost invariably extend to the aperture. These are the most 

 <*onspicuously banded snails we found during the two seasons' work, 

 except 0. peripherica form albofasciata. They were found scattered 

 for a mile up the canyon, and were quite abundant in a small rock 

 slide covered by Clematis. This station also yielded the following:

 about two miles to the north from Logan Canyon. Oreohelix slrigosa 

 depressa (Ckll.), a few alive under mountain maples in the edges of 

 rock slides, dead shells common. 



Sta. 89, between 87 and 88, along the west slope of the mountain. 

 Oreohelix haydeni hybrida (Hemph.), dead shells scattered, but 

 especiallj' common where limestone ledges are exposed at the mouths 

 of small ravines. About a dozen live snails were found under sage- 

 brush in rock slides, but none under Balsamorrhiza, which is usually 

 excellent cover for Oreohelix where it droops over rocks. Here the 

 plant wa.s found in loose soil, not about the rocks. The evidence is 

 abundant that the vegetative cover has here been greatly reduced by 

 overgrazing, followed, as usual in such ca.ses, by active erosion. The 

 colony is likely near extinction. A few dead shells of Vitrina alaskana 

 Dall were found.

While in this district we discovered that our 0. peripherica stations 

 4 and 30, 1915, are on opposite sides of the same small mountain.

Deweyville, Utah. 



Deweyville Postofiice is in Box Elder County, Utah, fifteen miles 

 north of Brigham. Some confusion is likely to arise from the fact 

 that the railroads, both steam and electric, passing through the 

 town, have abijreviated the name to Dewey, though some maps and 

 gazetteers locate a Dewey post village in Grand County. Specimens 

 of Oreohelix collected and labelled by Hemphill, in the collection of 

 Mr. Daniels, bear the locality label, "Dewey, Box Elder Co., Utah," 

 and are designated as utahensis. Specimens in the Hemphill col- 

 lection in the cabinet of Mrs. Ida S. Oldroyd, and others placed by 

 her in the University of Colorado Museum, were labelled by Hemp- 

 hill: "Smooth variety of binneiji, passing into albida. Dewey, 

 Utah. Large." Another lot, designated bj' him as "var. albida," 

 is from "Collinston, Utah," which is about five miles north of 

 Deweyville, and three lots labelled albida by him are from Logan, 

 according to the labels. A careful examination of this material 

 under a leas convinces us that it is identical with the smooth form 

 of O. h. hybrida from Sta. 102, which grades so completely into 

 typical hybrida that we cannot consider it entitled to a separate 

 name, even as a "form."

 Oquirrh Mountain, Utah, and at Glenwood Springs, Colorado. 



Ogden, Utah. 



Sta. 105, mouth of Ogden Canyon. OreoheUx strigosa depressa 

 (Ckll.), dead shells about the granite and quartzite slides for a mile 

 up the canyon on both sides. Live examples were found by a 

 moment's search at several points, particularly abundant under a 

 large mat of Clematis on one quartzite slide. lileached shells also 

 extend along the west slope of the mountains to a gulch about a mile 

 to the north, as far as we went. Brush fires swei)t the mountains 

 some years ago, so the vegetative cover is now very i)()or and erosion 

 is rapidly stripping the steep slopes. Binney'^ recorded Fupilla 

 blandi (Morse) from Ogden and Vertigo corpuUnta (Morse) from 

 Ogden Canyon. Proi)al)ly the latter record should be referred to 

 V. modesta parietalis (Ancey),'* of which Ogden Canyon is' the type 

 locality. Binncy's material recorded as corpulenta was collected 

 Ijy Hemphill, and the fact that other material described by Ancey 

 at about this time was received by him from the same collector 

 makes the supposition that his parietali.s was obtained by Hemphill 

 reasonable, and ln'nce prol»ably Binney's and Ancey 's records arc 

 not only from the same canyon, but frcjm the same lot of material.

 not distinctly carinated and nmch flatter and .smoother than typical

wasatchensis from the next station and peripherica from other locali- 

 ties. As we had expected, Pilsbry's report on the soft anatomy is 

 that the genitalia of wasatchensis and peripherica agree. As usual, 

 Vitrina alaskona Dall is common at this station. 



Sta. 109. This station is east of, but continuous with, Sta. 108, 

 the separation having been made only because of the greater variation 

 at the lower end of the colony. Following up a draw toward the 

 mountain, the smoother, depressed, non-angular form soon dis- 

 appeared, but the typical, high-spired, strongly ribbed, carinated 

 form was found plentifully under the leaves, often with very scant 

 cover, a single small leaf being sometimes sufficient, though the 

 weather was hot and dry. The colony continues up the mountain 

 slope into a quartzite slide, where many of the large pieces of rock 

 are well rounded. Some years ago brush fires burned the leaves to 

 the bottom of the slides along this slope, so we were able to find no 

 live snails above the brush in the ravine and along the side of the 

 valley, which was not touched by fire. We had very carefully 

 searched the region for several miles north and south and up the 

 canyon for this species, but without success until we reached this 

 place, which seemed to be the last chance. We are quite convinced 

 that it is the exact type locality of the subspecies. It answers 

 Hemphill's description, as no other place we found does, but he does 

 not appear, from his notes, to have worked down into the gulch 

 where the live snails are plentiful now. The topography and an old, 

 al)and()n('(l road make it seem likely that he would have passed over 

 this quartzite slide on his way to the mountain. In his description 

 he says: "This pretty and interesting shell I found among quartzite 

 boulders, in crevices sufficiently large to afford cool and moist retreats 

 during the active summer season and safe places for hil)ernating 

 during the cold months. This shell seems to be confined in its range 

 to a very limited area, for I did not find a single sjK'cimen, either 

 dead or alive, outside of a little jjlat containing an acre of ground.'' 

 The last sentence quoted agrees with our experience, after collecting 

 from 120 stations in Utah and southern Idaho. IlcmjihiU's state- 

 ment that almost the first shell he picked up at Ogden was wasalchen- 

 sis indicates that he did not go first into the canyon, or he would 

 have found there plenty of depressa and no wasatchensis. 



Promontohy Range. 



Thi.s range of mountains forms a narrow peninsula jutting into 

 Great Salt Lake from the north. The southern portion formed an 




1917.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 69 



island perhaps twenty-five miles in length during the maximum 

 expansion of ancient Lake Bonneville. Hague's'* discussion is 

 quoted at length by Butler and Heikes,^ with additional information, 

 in a recent bulletin. The isolation of the range and the presence of 

 large bodies of limestone, brush and trees lead us to believe that 

 systematic work there would produce interesting results, but our 

 time was limited and the single day spent at the extreme southern 

 end was disappointing. The only mollusks we saw were Vallonia 

 cyclophorcUa Ancey and Fupilla blandi (Morse), under small bushes 

 in rock slides at Sta. 107, an isolated limestone butte close to the 

 railroad station of Saline. This butte was either covered by the 

 waters of Lake Bomieville or formed only a tiny rocky island. The 

 vegetative cover across the southern slope of the range is everywhere 

 too scant for the larger snails. 



Morgan and Devil's Slide District, Utah. 



Oreohclix haydeni (Gabb) was described from material said to 

 have been obtained in "Webber" Canyon, I'tah.-' We have not 

 been able to learn of any canyon bearing that name, and are assured 

 by men long and well acquaintctl with Utah that the well-known 

 Weber Canyon is the one intended. Unfortunately, that name has 

 been .sometimes used to designate the whole valley of the Weber 

 River and its larger tributaries. It is (juite desirable to find this 

 species alive in the type locality or elsewhere, in order to a.scertaia 

 the anatomy. In 1915 we searched for it in what is more i)roperly 

 called Weber Canyon, below Clateway, without success. In 1916 

 we made two trips to th(.> upper canyon, above Morgan, without 

 8ucce.ss so far as typical haydeni is concerned, but found other 

 interesting forms. Between Morgan and (lateway, a i)r()ad valh'y, 

 with canyons entering from l)oth sides, and the wiiole canyon south 

 of Echo- afford a large field as yet wholly untouched. Binney's** 

 report of live haydeni received from Hemphill is incorrect, as IL'mp- 

 hill did not lind true haydeni, though much of his material from the 

 Oquirrh Mountains wa.s .sent out under that name. 



Sta. 47. gulch on north side of valley, about half a mile north of 

 Morgan depot. Onohelix periphcrica (Ancey), the binneyi (Hemph.)

Sta. 114. south side of canyon, about a mile southeast of Morgan 

 depot, close to a big warm spring and picnic grountl, where the broad 

 valley narrows into the canyon, east side of a limestone ledge at the 

 base of a red sandstone hill. Oreohelix strigosa depressa (Ckll.) 

 abundant beneath Bahamorrhiza sagittata, sagebrush and other 

 herbs and shrubs overhanging the rocks, but equally abundant deep 

 in the red soil beneath such plants; an unusual hal)itat for this 

 subspecies. 



Sta. 11 o, west side of the same ledge, the same subspecies. Sta- 

 tions 114 and Ho constitute really a single colony, but we arbitrarily 

 separatetl it and gave tlifferent numbers to our material, because 

 many of the shells from one side of the ledge are more depressed than 

 those from the other .side, though the ledge is narrow and the colony 

 actually extends across it. 



Sta. 113, a short distance up the canyon from Sta. 114, on same 

 side. Oreohelix strigosa depressa (Ckll.), dead shells very abundant 

 on a limestone slope where the scrub oak and mountain maple 

 thicket has recently been burned and all leaves and underbrush thus 

 destroyed. 



Sta. 112, l)ig limestone slides not far above Sta. 113, on same side 

 of canyon, concealed from the road by tall shrubbery. Oreohelix 

 strigosa depressa (Ckll.), snudl (15 mm. to 18 mm. in diameter), 

 white, strongly banded. 



Sta. Ill, next point of rocks, about 200 yards ea.st of Sta. 112, 

 at foot of canyon wall, beneath limestone ledge, perhaps two miles 

 east of Morg:in. Oreohelix perlpherica (Ancey) conunon in leaves 

 beneath scrul) oaks and mountain maples, showing complete inter- 

 graflation between Hemphill's binneiji and albofasciata forms, as at 

 .several stations in tin.' ("ache Junction district, discussed in our 

 former report. This station is about 05 miles from Cache .Junction 

 in an air line. O. periphrrica at all other stations where we have 

 found it lacks the albofasriata form, so it is interesting to find the 

 intergradation again at this most remote station for the species. 



Sta. 110, some distance above Sta. Ill, on same side of canyon, 

 below the railnjad tunnel, nearly opposite Sta. 53. Oreohelix strigosa 

 (kpresm (Ckll.), dormant, deep in the rock slides and hard to find 

 during the hot, dry season when we were there, (ieneraliy this 

 .•^ubsjM'cies ha.s not been found l)y us very deej) in the slides. 



Sta. 48, both .sides of and above the "slide," south side of canyon, 

 Devil's Sli<le, Utah. Onohilix h<iydeni hyhrida (HeMii)h.) conunon 

 beneath the heavy, drooping radical leaves of Jialsamorrhiza, on

steep limestone slopes, not in the rock slides. Dead shells plentiful. 

 The vicinity is covered by a thick coat of lime dust from the cement 

 plant. It is strange that any live examples wore found under the 

 circumstances. 



Sta. 49, west slope of first gulch that enters the canyon from the 

 north below the Devil's Slide depot. Oreohelix haijdeni form gahbiana 

 (Hemph.) under sagebrush, mountain maple, scrub oak, wild cherry 

 and other shrubs at the edges of limestone slides, common alive, 

 dead shells plentiful. The narrow-leafed cottonwood grove in the 

 bottomland beneath the slides yielded:

Sta. 51, below Sta. 50, opposite (north ofj the railroad tunnel, 

 just east of a dry gulch that comes in from the north. Oreohelix 

 hoydcni form (j<d)biana (Hemph.) plentiful in edges of rock slides. 

 The following were also found: 



Vitrina alaskana Dall. Pyramidida cronkhitei anthonyi 



Euconulus fulvus alaskensis Pils. Pils. 



Zonitoides arborea (Say). 



Sta. 52, across the mouth of the gulch just mentioned, west of 

 Sta. 51, thence along the ba.sc of the canyon wall for some distance 

 around the curve. Oreohelix hnydeni form gabbiana (Hemph.), less 

 common than at Sta. 51. 



Sta. 53, ea.st-facing slope .southwest of Sta. 52, west of the railroad 

 tunnel, separated from Sta. 52 by a hundred yards or so of .slope 

 free from rock slides, where we found no snails. Oreohelix haydcni 

 form gabbiana (Hemph.), a few found alive, dead shells plentiful. 



Sta. 5-1, a mile down the canyon from Sta. 5li, on an ea.st-facing 

 .•^lopc when' the wagon ntad approaches the railroad. Oreohelix 

 haydcni hybrida (Hemph.), ))lentiful under poison ivy in rock slides. 



Tlu' Oreohelices from stations 4S, A*J, 51. 52, 53 and 51, all belong 

 to the haydeni group. Hence the soft anatomy is the same and shell 

 characters alone mast be relied upon in their separation. Not a 

 single example has an strong spiral .sculpture as typical haydeni or

oquirrhcnsis, thoup:h a few ajiproach it. (). h. hybrida, from its type 

 locality at Logan, is reatlily distinguished from 0. h. form gabbiana 

 from its tj-pe locality in the Oquirrh Mountains, hut at these stations 

 we have a puzzling mixture and variation of characters, so that the 

 determinations are made witli some hesitation. The stations are 

 not far apart and in the same canyon, so they may almost be con- 

 sidered one large colony. The form at the extremes of the colony 

 so considered, stations 48 and 54, seems referable to hybrida, a 

 considerable proportion of those from Sta. 48 being typical, others 

 varj'ing more or less in peripheral angulation and the altitude of the 

 spire, but the spiral sculpture in tliose from Sta. 54 is obscure, much 

 weaker than in the typical form. Both lots have the whorls well 

 rounded from above and below to the more or less angled, but not 

 keeled, periphery. The form at Sta. 49 (next to 48) and Sta. 53 

 (next to 54), we refer to gabbiana, not tj'pical. It is really transitional 

 from the hybrida of 48 and 54 to the gabbiana of 51 and 52. On the 

 average the whorls are not so well rounded, the spire flatter antl the 

 angulation more pronounced, though they are somewhat variable 

 in all these characters. On the whole, they seem more nearly related 

 to the form at the nearest stations, 51 and 52, than to the form at 

 the more remote stations, 48 and 54. Some examples are entirely 

 indistinguishable from material labelled utahensis from Hemphill's 

 collection. The form at stations 51 and 52, which we refer to 

 gabbiana, has a depressed spire and the whorls slope rather flatly 

 from above and below to a keeled periphery. The spiral sculpture 

 is variaijle, the primary spirals in some examples being nearly as 

 strong as those in typical oquirrhensis, though only indistinctly seen 

 in others. These forms are further di.scu.ssed in the sections on 

 Dewey ville and Oquirrh Mountains.

Salt Lake City, Utah. 



We did not stop at Salt Lake City to do any collecting in 1916, 

 but have recently received from Mr. L. A. Giddings, of that city, 

 two small lots of Oreohelix strigosa depressa form cornea (Hemph.), 

 one from his Sta. 1, upper slopes of Red Butte Canyon, the other 

 from his Sta. 2, close to the creek in City Creek Canyon. In both 

 lots the spires are much more elevated than usual, but otherwise they 

 correspond with Hemphill's specimens oV carnea, of which the type 

 locality is "near Salt Lake, Utah," and which we found in Dry 

 Canyon in 1915. Pilsbry writes that the anatomy is that of depressa. 

 It may be well to say that this form, sent out by Hemphill, is to be 

 found in many cabinets bearing a printed label on which, by a 

 typographiciil error, an o ha.s taken the j)lace of an a, making the name 

 corneus, which should be corrected. We also note another typo- 

 graphical error in Heinphiirs printed labels, the i having been omitted 

 from gabhia/td.

 Springs, near Salt Lake, Utah." The two last mentioned may well 

 be doubted. He also, on p. 399, records Succmea nuttaUiajia Lea 

 from the Warm Springs locality — a doubtful record. Binney^* 

 records Succinea haydeni W. G. B. from Salt Lake City. 



Utah Lake, Utah. 



Tliis district is covered by the Salt Lake topographic sheet of the 

 United States Geological Survey. Utah Lake was included in Lake 

 Bonneville during the "Lake Period. " It now remains fresh because 

 it has an outlet, the Jordan River, through which it drains into 

 Great Salt Lake. However, the water is said to be not so free from 

 salts as formerly, owing to the extensive use of water for irrigation. 

 Cameron-^ reports that the mineral content, chiefly sodium chloride, 

 of the lake water increased from 300 parts of total solids per million 

 parts of solution in 1883, to 1,400 parts per million in 1903 — a period 

 of twenty years. It is not likely that the salinity will increase so 

 much as to be fatal to fresh-water moUusks or even to seriously 

 modify them. Call*^ and Stearns have discussed the influence of 

 temperature and salinity in modifying the shells of this region, 

 and the arid region farther west. In his bulletin Call records the 

 following species from Utah Lake: 



Pisidium compressinn Prime. Ly^nncca stagjialis Linn. 



SphiErium denlalum (Hald.). Lymncca idahcnsis Call. 



Ancylus sp. Physa ampullacea Gld.

 then (h'scrilx'd, but has since been described from Bear Lake (fossil)

 but the aperture is considerably expanded and not quite tjTiical. 

 Judge(l by liaird's description and Binney's figures, the Phijsa from 

 this station appears to be true P. lordi. Material from the Douglas 

 Lake district, Michigan, referred by some conchologists to lordi, 

 by others to P. anrilhtrin parkvri, differs markedly from the Utah 

 Lake form and Binney's figures in its tabulate form, whidi is due 

 to the decidedly fiat upper surface of the last whorl and the much 

 more acute angulation of the shoulder. The same is true of material 

 from CheLseu, C^uebec, though the difference in that ca.se is not so

stations are possibly the tjT^e locality, described as a "detached pile 

 of rocks," "at the foot of the mountain." It has .seemed almost 

 hopeless to recognize utahensis. Pilsbry^'* has discus.sed the confusion 

 in which he found the descriptions and figures of this form. Hemp- 

 hill's description (in a letter to Binney) was quite inadequate, as 

 follows : 



"This has the form of hemphilli, but is destitute of the revolving 

 ridges of haydcni. The specimens were all constant in sculpturing, 

 but varied very much in size and .somewhat in form." 



Binney published the letter, and on a subsequent page of the same 

 publication says of utahensis: 



"This is a rough, coarse, carinated strigosa, figured in Terr. Moll, 

 V, p. 158, fig. 66. The peristome is sometimes continuous by a 

 heavy raised callus, connecting its terminations. It is .sometimes 

 smaller and more elevated." 



As Pilsbry has pointed out, the figure referred to was based upon 

 material from Big Horn Basin, Wyoming, and Binney added charac- 

 ters belonging to the Wyoming form, now known as 0. strigosa 

 magnicornu Pils. The connected terminations of the peristome is a 

 common feature in a number of species of Oreohelix, including Hemp- 

 hill's forms oquirrhensis and gabbiana, and hence is not of diagno.stic 

 significance. Material we have seen from the Hemphill collection, 

 bearing the name utahensis, is mostly labelled "near Salt Lake," 

 but one small lot is lai)elled " near Logan. " We cannot know whether 

 any of it came from Oquirrh Mountains, but it all agrees cjuite well 

 with our stations 14 and 111) material. The exact ty])e locality of 

 utahensis is not known, except that it is on the west side of this range, 

 and there is no more probable place than these two stations, which 

 really form l)ut one small colony, being each of small extent and l)ut 

 a few rods apart. We cannot ascertain from the descriptions and 

 figures alone, with certainty, just what utahensis is. Material from 

 Hemphill's collection does not settle it, l)ecause of the ab.sence of 

 d<'signated types and cotypes, the uncertainty as to whether any 

 we have .seen are even topotypes, and the fact that lie :i|)i):irentiy 

 u.sed that name for more than one form. His hcniphilli, with which 

 ho compared ntfthcn.sis, is not true hrniphiUi, but is the material \\v 

 collected in the ()(|uirrh .M<»untains and distributeil uiuler that 

 name, which cannot be separated from his ogiiirrhensis from the

find that oquirrhensis has ver\' strong ribs and is keeled, agreeing 

 with specimens he distril)uted under that name and with our material 

 from .Sta. 120; while in his gahhiana the spirals are quite weak or 

 nearly obsolete, with the periphery' compre.s.sed into a distinct keel, 

 the i>rimary spirals being usually visible to the unaided eye, the 

 secondaries visible under a lens, thus agreeing in all respects with 

 the material from our Sta. 15. It has distinctly the two series of 

 spirals characteristic of the haijdeni group— a few ribs, with inter- 

 calated riblets. Our stations 14 and 119 specimens, which we 

 consider of the utahensis form, are well angled, but the peripherj' is 

 not pincluMl into a keel. There is perhaps a little greater variation 

 in the altitude of the spire. The spiral sculpture is weaker, and in 

 most examples the microscopic riblets are crowtled and subequal, 

 iastead of a few stronger ribs with intercalated riblets. However, 

 in a few examples the compound sj)iral sculpture is distinctly present, 

 thus forming a series grading into the form gahhiana. Viewed in 

 ma.ss, material from stations 14 and 119 can be distinguished at once 

 from that found at Sta. 15, and Sta. 15 material can be distinguished 

 from that found at Sta. 120,.l)Ut i)lenty of individuals are found to 

 connect them all. If anyone insists upon considering these forms 

 sufficiently' distinct, in spite of complete intergradation, to merit 

 separate names, then utahensis should be applied to the Sta. 14 form, 

 as it is usually "destitute of the revolving ribs [not of the riblets] of 

 haydeni," a description not at all fitting other forms from this region. 

 In selecting a name, it would .seem most natural to select the one 

 occurring first in the original pul)lication. though all occur on the 

 same page in licmphiU's lett«'r to liinney. That would be utahensis. 

 The .same thing would result if we .select the first one in Binney's 

 notes, a.s utahensis precedes (K/uirrhensin and gahhiana by one page. 

 We have seen the difficulty of recognizing u ahensis, while (Xiuirrhensis 

 is well figured and suffici«'ntly described. The confused description 

 and figurt! do not satisfy the priority rule re(|uiring a name to be 

 accompanied by a description, in order to be accepted. Part of 

 the description flatly contradicts the Hemphill specimens, which 

 would otherwise perhaps enable us to definitely decide what the 

 name appli<'d to. The rules of nomenclature justify the selection 

 of the name otiuirrhensis, instead of utahetisis, un<ler the circum- 

 stances. Kspecially is this course justified by .\rt. 2H of the Inter- 

 national Code of Zoological N<unen<'latun', which provides that 

 "if the names are of the same dat«', that s<'lected by the first revi.ser 

 shall stand," an<l recommendation h. that a specific name accom- 




so PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



panied by l)oth description and figure stands in preference to one 

 accompanied only by a diagnosis or only by a figure, the figure of 

 utahcnuis in the present case being either spurious or doubtful. 

 The page precedence recommendation (c) only applies when "other 

 things are equal." The name utahensis should be dropped and 

 gabbiana used (if at all) only as a "form" name, not in a subspecific 

 sense. 



We revisited Sta. 15 and found one live example of the gabbiana 

 form, so it is possible that the colony may survive the destructive 

 fire of 1915, as a new growth of scrub oak is starting and will soon 

 furnish fair cover. 



!>tarting at Sta. 120, we found old, bleached shells of Oreohelix 

 haydeni oquirrhensis (Hemph.), robust and strongly ribbed spirall}', 

 though the ribbing is somewhat -variable. The ribs below the 

 sharply keeled periphery vary from four to seven and are usually 

 somewhat unecjual in prominence or spacing or both. Above the 

 keel there are usually four ribs, sometimes only three. These shells 

 are ver>' abundant among the charred stumps of scrub-oak thickets, 

 which had been recently burned, but were not found in the rock 

 slides. Persistent search up the gulch and across the low divide to 

 the south, failed to reveal a single live snail, though everywhere 

 "bones" were ])lentiful to the top of the divide. They are all nmch 

 weathered. Our impression is that the colony may have been 

 destroyed long ago, as this portion of the range has apparently been 

 swept by fires before, and is now barren for many miles. H('mi)lull 

 found this form abundant alive somewhere near here over thirty 

 years ago. We found a number of bleached shells which we doulit- 

 fully a.ssign to Succitiea oregonaisis Lea. The>' vary from grosvenori- 

 like to avara-like shells. The absence of cohtr cMliaiucs the difficulty 

 of .specific determination. 



Probably the colony of Sta. 120 cros.ses the divide well up the 

 mountain, and thus connects with Sta. 121, in the next ravine, where 

 the same .subspecies of Oreohelix was found, all dead shells, some 

 nearly a.s coarsely ribbed as at Sta. 120, though the average examples 

 have much less conspicuous ribs, usually seven or eight below, 

 occasionally only four. 



At Sta. 122, on the west slope of the mount iiin, not in llie gulch, 

 but only a short di.stance from 121, the few examples found, all dead 

 shells, are .smaller, slightly flatter and smoother than at Sta. 121, 

 very near typical 0. h. gahhiana (Hemph.), but exhibiting a tendency 

 to grade into oquirrhensis. 




1017.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 81 



This ncar-gabbiana form wa.s found again at Sta. 123, but the 

 shells here were soinewliat larger. 



Material reported from these mountains by Hemphill under the 

 names hoydcni, hcmphiUi and oquirrhensis is all oquirrhensis. Re- 

 peat etl careful examinations, l)v one of the present writers, of such 

 material in several Hemphill collections, fail to discover any basis 

 for or consistency in his separation of the material. Professor 

 T. D. A. C'ockerell and Dr. Paul Bart.sch recently, at our request, 

 compared examples of oquirrhensis from our Sta. 120 with three 

 examples from the type lot of hnydeni, from We))er Canyon, in the 

 United States National Museum, and find them ''(luite distinct." 

 Professor Cockerell writes: "The difference in the spiral keels is 

 constant. In hatjdeni the whorls are rounded, the keels subequal, 

 and the peripheral keel not distinct as in the Oquirrh Mountain 

 specimens. Haydeni has a di.stinct channel below the suture, which 

 is not present in the r)(juirrli Mountain material."

KV H. A. PIL.SHHV AM) .1. II. FERRISS. 



In the summer of 101.5, hcsinning in the second week of August, 

 we collected in the Black Range of New Mexico. Approaching 

 from the west, by way of the Mimi>res X'alleyantl up Clallina Canyon, 

 we reached the crest above the head of. f^ilver Creek. Subsequent 

 camps were made at intervals from Sawyer Peak, the southern end 

 of the range, to Reed's ranch on Black Canyon, our route being along 

 the crest trail, with numerous short trips down the slopes, and a two- 

 day trip to Kingston, in the eastern foothills. After September r2th 

 Ferriss continued the exploration alone, in Morgan and Diamond 

 Creeks on the main range, then eastward to Chloride, the Cuchillo 

 Mountains and the San Mateo Mountains, west of San Marcial, 

 in the southern edge of Socorro County. Travel was by pack train. 

 Thnjughout the trip we had the services of an excellent packer, 

 Teodoro Solis. a native of Chihuahua. 



The Black liange is on the boundary bet we«'n (irant and Sierra 

 Counties, about 40 miles north of Deming. New Mexico. In the 

 north it forms part of the continental divide. The Mimbres River 

 \'allev on the west i.solates the Black from the Mogollon Range and 

 its outlif'rs. The range is narrow and sharp, its Hanks deeply fur- 

 rowed, but without long spur.-. Hillsboro Peak is lO.OOO ft. high. 

 Much of the crest trail is from H.oCM) to slightly over O.(MM) ft. elevation.

 the range at i)resent. 



A good crest trail is maintained by the Forestry Service, and 

 several cabins along it are occupied by forest rangers during the 

 dry season. At the time we were there, the range was uninhabited 

 except for two men caring for mines in Silver Creek, and several at 

 Reed's ranch on Black Canyon. Deer, bear and wild turkeys are 

 abundant. There are no rattlesnakes in the forest zone, though 

 occasionally seen up to about 0,000 feet. 



Eastern Foothills of the Black Range. — Returning to Deming from 

 Chloride. th«' limestone ridges about Chloride were found barren of 

 shells, although they had been seen there by miners at an earlier 

 day. At the Oliver Mine, on Mineral Creek, 4 miles above Chloride, 

 Oreohelix pilsbryi was found. A few miles southward, on the north side 

 of a limestone mountain at Sam's Canyon, Holospira cockcrelU was 

 abundant , and a few ver>' old ' ' bones " of Oreohelix metcalfei and cooperi 

 were found. Again in a like situation on the Little Palomas Creek, 

 Holospira was plentiful, and again at Hermosa. This is a small 

 village on the Big Palomas Creek, all that remains of a settlement 

 of over 2.000 miners in flush times. Teodoro had seen shells here 

 years ago, when emiiloyed as suiierintendent at the Ocean Wave 

 Mine, but not even '"bones" remain. Acro.ss the .stream, however, 

 and down stream for a mile or more, Oreohelix and Holospira were 

 al)undant. Hard digging was re(|uired to get living shells, as the 

 hillside of fine soil and limestone spawls had been completely ])l<)wed 

 up by herds of goats. The snails found shelter under the roots of 

 dead oaks and in undisturbed rock. 



In llic foothill region there was extensive mining years ago, with 

 conse(juent destruction of the small wood which grew in favoralde 

 places. 



Although a sharp lookout was kej)t. nothing fuither was foinid

The Cuchillo Range. 



This range is about six miles east of Chloride, the post office of 

 Fairvicw at the foot of the mountains. The peaks probably reach 

 up to 7,500 feet. 



On a brushy northern slope on the Thomas Seale trail, in the 

 southern end of the range, Oreohelix melcalfei ciichillensis and Holo- 

 apira cockcrclli were found in abundance. The cover was scant, 

 and cattle plentiful. Both species were found again a couple of miles 

 further on, in Frank Calhoun's pasture. In l)oth places they lived 

 in groves of oak, under limestone spawls and dead timber. 



At the north end of the range the peaks are higher, some having 

 large outcrops of fossiliferous limestone," but the only evidences of 

 living shells obtained were a few "bones" of Helicodiscus. In drift 

 debris, however, were many small shells which apparently graze on 

 the gras.sy .slopes and meadows. 



Tm: San Matko Han(.k. 



The San Mateo Range probably reaches a height of 8,000 feet. 

 The southern end is al>out 15 mih's north of Mont!cello Post ( )f!ice, 

 a village on the Canada Alamosa. The rock in this part of the range 

 is a friable, crumbling granite. Nearly the entire southern end is 

 a continuous slope of granitic fragments, many feet in depth. The 

 mesa continues nearly to Monticello. Pinyon, juniper and low- 

 gnnving shrubs cover the hillsides. Along Chipjiy Creek, walnut, 

 (juaking asp and yellow j)ine prevail. 



.Vround the edges of the rocky slides, Oreohelix rooperi and Anh- 

 mnneUu were fairly abundant, but the <maller shells were scarce.

 ASHMUNELLA. 



The Black Range Ashmunellas resemble those of the Mogollon 

 and Chiricahua Ranges in the genitalia. The penis is more or less 

 distinctly bipartite by a submedian constriction. 



In A. binneyi, A. tetrodon, and in A. tnogolloneusis of the Mogollon 

 Range, a retractor mu-scle of a few slender strands attaches to 

 both segments of the penis and to the epiphallus further up, but 

 there is no continuation attaching to the diaphragm. 



In ,-1. mendax and A. cockerelli with its subspecies there is, in 

 addition to the incoherent penial retractor just described, a broad, 

 verj' thin and extremely short band connecting the epiphallus with 

 the diaphragm. This is similar to the condition in most other 

 Ashmunellas except that the connection with the diaphragm is here 

 verj' short. 



All of the species have the usual short flagellum, about l.o mm. 

 long. The constancy in Ashmunello of this minute, seemingly 

 vestigeal organ is remarkable. 



Aside from the particulars noted above, the organs an' much alike 

 in the several species. For convenient compari.son the measurements, 

 in millimeters, an- given in one table, ,1. tnogollonensis Ix'ing added

Very often the inner of the two basal teeth is wanting, being 

 reduced to a sloping callus against the other tooth.

 8,500 feet. 



This .species differs from A. mendax by the angularity and the 

 microscopic .sculpture of the last whorl. Also by the absence of 

 any penial retractor muscle attached to the diaphragm. It is far 

 smoother than any form of A. cockereVi, and not carinate. 



It is certainly far less widely spread than A. mendax. We found 

 it ordy in an area of a couple of miles along the western flank of the 

 range, from Upper Silver Creek to Upper Spring Creek, well within 

 the heavily forested zone. No doubt it will be found over a some- 

 what wider area; yet its absence in our many .stations both north and 

 .south indicate that it is a relatively local species.

The shell resembles A. mogoUonensis, but is less robust, with 

 diff"erent microscopic sculpture, lighter colored, being between 

 tawny-olive and saccardo umber, often with a lighter streak from a 

 former resting period. The third and fourth whorls have minute 

 growth-wrinkles interrupted to form oblong granules in places, and 

 an excessively minute sjiiral striation. On the last whorl the growth- 

 wrinkles are low, unetjual and continuous, and there are many weakly 

 imprcsx'd spiral lines. Last whorl descends slightly in front. The 

 aperture is small, toothless; lip white, narrowly reflected. The

The shell, while superficially very like .4. mogoUoncnsis, is easily 

 distinguished by the somewhat granose intermediate whorls and 

 far le.ss deeply engravetl last whorl. In .4. mogoUohensis there is no 

 granulation, and the la.st whorl is very deeply and closely engraved 

 spirally (PI. VII, fig. 10). In the genitalia, the pre.><ence of a very 

 short, broad penial retractor attacheti to the diaphragm distinguishes 

 mendax (PI. X, fig. 1 1 from mogoUonensis (PI. X, fig. 3), in which 

 there is none. 



This snail has a remarkable range. Tlir lowest colonies on both 

 sides are far below the fore-st, especially on the west side, where it 

 was found in great numbers in the arid (Jallina Canyon. The 

 examples here are rather small, diam. 10 to 17.3 mm. On the east 

 sitle we took it under wood and rubbisii in a garden of Kingston, 

 where it was conmion. Most of the other localities are along the 

 crest of the range, in the humid forest zone. The tyi)e locality is 

 on th(i south side of Iron Creek some distanc*' above the mouth of 

 Spring Creek, at the entrance of a ravine; from the south, where 

 there has been rather extensive mine jirosijecting.

PROCEEDIN(i.< OF THE ACADEMY OF

On the west slope of the Black Range there are two forms: (1) 

 in the south, 0. m. concentrica, broadly umbilicate, with low, wide 

 spiral cords on the Viase. and (2) further north, 0. in. radiata, with 

 strong radial sculpture, remarkably like 0. elrodi. On the eastern 

 slope we have (3). southward, 0. m. acutidiscus, broadly umbilicate, 

 with fine spiral antl coarser radial sculpture, and (4) further north, 

 0. hermoscnais, nearly smooth, angular only in front. iStill further 

 north a few *' bones" of t\'pical metcalfei were found, acutely keeled 

 throughout and nearly smooth. Northeast of here was found 

 0. tn. cuchillensis, which is so weakly angular that we at first thought 

 it a form of 0. strigosa depressa. Further west 0. pilsbryi was found. 

 Further north, in Socorra County, there is 0. socorroensis, an angular, 

 roughly sculptured shell, as vet known onlv bv perfectlv l)leached 

 "bones." 



The metadfei group therefore comprises, besides the original type, 

 forms resembling 0. haydeni, 0. elrodi and 0. strigosa depressa; each 

 being alone in its district. The distribution may be represented 

 diagrammatically thus:

In most specimens the intervals Ix'tween the cords on the base are 

 dull brown, or when concolored the spiral stria' make them appear 

 darker, giving an appearance of relief to the cords. A few individuals 

 from Station 11 (a branch ravine of Silver Creek south of Cray's 

 cabin) have the base blackish chocolate. 



Specimens with the sjiiral cords on the base less (•on>])icuous and 

 the color usually darker clouded and l)anded with dull walnut 

 l)rown in varying degree — were found at Station 20. at the (Jrand

 At Station 17*. on th«' we.st side of Sawyer Peak about 500 feet below

 color to broadly banded below with chocolate, the sjiiral cortls 

 therefore inconspicuous.

 or this may be widened, suffusing much of the base (.figs. C, 6a), 

 with also a cinnamon line on the upper surface. In a few examples,

 »j miles from Chloride, Sierra County. Several hundred living 

 examples were obtained. See Nautilus, XXX, p. 102. 



Oreoheliz cooper? W, O. B.) PI. IX, figs. .5-9. 



This region, which forms the southern border of the vast area of 

 coopcri, has a (•ai)acious form of the species. Many examples are 

 typical in coloring (figs. 7, 9), but pale shells with faint bands or none 

 are al)undant, esjx'cially on Silver Creek (figs. G. S. 8a). Occasionally 

 throughout tin* range, >i)('cimens were found with very broad, almost 

 black bands (figs. 5, oa). The.se color forms are to l)e found together, 

 throughout the forest zone of the range. Thus, figs. 5 7 (Station 9) 

 and 8, 8a (Station 4.J) are from Silver Creek; fig. 9 from Holdcn's 

 Spring (Station 26). TIk' extremes of elevation of the s\mv may 

 also be found in single colonics. The sha|)c and color mutations or 

 forms arc spread throughout the range, though particular color-forms 

 are often prevalent at one or another station. 



The specimens figured measure as follows:

NOTES ON FISHES FROM NEW JERSEY. PENNSYLVANIA, AND MARYLAND. 

 HV HENUV \V. FOWLER. 



Within the pa.-<t two years some local fishes have been 

 obtained for the collections of the Academy. A number have 

 recently been studied, and as there are large series of specimens 

 in many ca.ses, representing the fish-faunas of a number of streams 

 heretofore not explored, a resume is here given. Several species 

 new to the region may also be noted, besides others rare or little 

 known. Among those to whom I am indebted for a.ssistance and 

 many favors are Messrs. C. S. Abbott. Jr., and R. M. Al)i)ott, Miss 

 K. Bell, Messrs. H. H. Burton. Edwin Fowler. W. J. Fox, H. W. 

 Hand, Philip Laurent, G. H. Lings, H. L. Mather, E. S. and W. I. 

 Mattern, W. E. Meehan. Dr. F. Pemiell, Mr. H. E. Thomp.son and 

 Dr. P.. O. Van Deasen. 



New Jersey. 



During the past season collections were made in late April in the 

 streams and bay-shore region of Cumberlantl County (Bivalve, 

 Cedarville, Sheppard's Mill and Fortescue): July 31, the Assanpink 

 Creek in Mercer County (Quaker Bridge); August 8, streams in 

 Warren Count}- (Musconetcong River and Hihickihocki Creek near 

 Stewartsville, and the Pohatcong Creek near Washington and Port 

 Colden); August 3, Hunterdon County (Wickecheok(> Creek at 

 Stockton and the I>oekat<jng Creek below Raven Rock), and on 

 September 27, near Frenchtown (Harihokake, Nishisakawick and 

 Coi)f)er Creeks). I have also examined the records of material 

 collected and such s|)ecimens as were brought to the i'hiladeli)hia

 They likewise obtained but a single example in the Delaware and 

 Raritan Canal in Trenton. As the stream in which my example 

 was taken is very clear and falls with moderate descent over red 

 shale rocks, it was possible to examine many fishes as they swam 

 about. ProbaV)ly a dozen other examples were s(>en in the same 

 locality. They usually kept together and did not appear to scatter 

 much or as.sociate with the dace or suckers.

A dried skin was found in the collection labelled Atlantic City,

 what it may be worth. It is 125 mm. in length. The species is 

 known to range from the tropical Atlantic and Florida to New Eng- 

 land, but its j)resence in New .Jersey has not previously been definitely 

 noted. 



It appears reasonably certain that Diodon pilof<i(s Mitchill is 

 simply the young of the present species, and therefore Trichodiodon 

 Bleeker simply a synonym of Diodon. I have examined similar 

 young specimens, evidently in the Trichodiodon stage, with the 

 flexible hair-like bristles, anfl conclude they are undevel()])ed. Among 

 many large exam|)les of Diodon, iinne were found with (tther than 

 lonii, stiff, rigid and strong spines.

to me. It seems that the soft or papery plates of Lyosphtrra are 

 simply the early stages of the .short, blunt, rigid spines of the adult

 writes: 




IIG PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



"We mentioned that the Jordan dries up during the summer. We 

 found it dry September 2 in the afternoon, with the exception of 

 three or four pools. Most of the jwols had fish in them. One in 

 particuhir, about ten feet long by three feet wide and its depth but 

 a few inches, was full of fish. In fact, it was hlled so that the backs 

 of the catfish projected from the water. We lifted about fifty pounds 

 of fish out of this hole and transplanted them to a larger body of 

 water, taking all we thought necessarj'. It may be of interest to 

 state that this was the farthest up stream we took or saw trout- 

 perch. Having forgotten the camera, we concluded to return next 

 day and take photographs of the pool and some of the fish in the net- 

 Imagine our surprise when visiting the jilace the next morning to 

 find the bed of the stream coveretl with three to five feet dejith of 

 water. AVe secured photographs further down stream, showing 

 some of the holes in the river Ijottom, through which the water 

 evidently disappears. Previous to arriving at this place we caught 

 some long-nosed dace, taken in swift water below a large spring. 

 AN'hen we say large spring we mean one that discharges thousands of 

 gallons of water per minute. 



"On September 22 we collected more trout-perch in the Jordan 

 at the original station, then went up stream to see if any more pools 

 formed. In tlie pool or depression where we took so many fish 

 during the last visit, the water evidently had just left, for some 

 catfisli and killifish were still alive. Kaccoons or minks had eaten 

 most of the larger fish, as fish heads and tails were still strewn about. 

 Another depression, at higher level, was still filled with water. Al- 

 together it is a remarkable stream, at one place dry, at another the 

 water runs eighteen inches deep, and so swift we could hardly keep 

 on our feet while crossing. We fished Lyon Vallej' also in the Jordan 

 and caught several fishes. It is about six miles up stream from the 

 first station at Helfrich's Springs."

Baird." Later' I -takxl, " Percopsis guttatus Agassiz has been 

 credited to the Delaware River by writers with reference to its 

 capture by Dr. diaries C. Abbott. However, Dr. Abbott tells me 

 that he ha.-^ never taken this fish in the Delaware, and also that he 

 has never seen a specimen from any part of the same river system. 

 The confusion he attriliutes to the remark which he made that 

 Baird had reported it from Easton, Pa." Its occurrence in the 

 Delaware was previously admitted 1\\' Jordan and Evermann,^ and 

 copied recently In' Kendall,^ in his paper on the identity of Pcrcopsis 

 (juttatus Agassiz with the earlier Salmo omiscomaycu.s Walbaum. 

 Uhler and Lugger first record^ it from the lower Potomac and also 

 state, "Prof. Baird has seen .specimens from the Susquehanna 

 River." Sul)sequently Smith and Bean mention iV from the 

 Potomac basin in Rock Creek and Cabin John Run, where "it is not 

 al>undant, .><o far as known." 



That Prof. Baird's Delaware River record was correct is quite 

 likely, as Messrs. Mattern have recently presented the Academy 

 with a number of examples, taken in the Jordan Creek near Allen- 

 town, or about three miles above the mouth where it debouches into 

 the Lehigh River. These little fish were captured August 26, 191G. 

 They were C}uite active, dwelling in the clear waters of the stream, 

 and associated with shiners, black-nosed dace, suckers and darters. 

 They are free swimmers, and travel in schools composed entirely of 

 their own specie-, anrl none were secured in water less than a foot 

 in depth. Their capture is of interest as serving to record with 

 certainty the trout-perch in the Delaware River l)asin. 



The allied western Columbia differs chiefly in the more ro])Ust 

 «lorsal and anal spines, the latter two in number. In my examples 

 <jf the trout-perch the dorsal and anal sjjines are slender. As the 

 species is sonu what variable, the following variations are from 1') 

 examples. Head 2; to 3i; depth .it to 4\ : I). Ill, rarely IV, 1) or 10, 

 rarely 8; A. I, 7. fre(iuently (i, rarely 'J; \'. I, 7; scales in lat( ral line

 I. 1. to anal origin. s<imetimes 7; snout 2f to A in head: eye '.\ to 31:

 went up the creek and after about three-rpiarters of a mile we caught 

 the darter. We suppose«| it to be the shielded dartt-r. as it has tlu- 

 plates or .scaU's on the belly and a slightly forked tail. We caught 

 two of them and think we saw four more. In fact, we were ai)le to

 you were abU* to catch your example with a hand net is a mysterj*. 

 As we stepped into the swift water they would immeiliately dart 

 lip stream and hide under stones. Occasionally one would rest in 

 an unprotected position on top of a stone, and as s(M)n as we made

This spocios was dt'scrilied from oxampU's (now 14 in number) in 

 the Academy, obtainetl from T. J. Craven at Hilton Head, South 

 CaroHna. As these examples are still in fair preservation, they have 

 been examined and compared with the accounts of other writers 

 published subsequently. Cope gives D. 11 antl A. 10. His series 

 shows D. usually 11 and occasionally 12, A. usually 0, occasionally 

 10 and rarely 8. He says, "Color in spirits bluish-lead color; fins 

 blackish." In this respect the body is now nearly uniform, though 

 the fins show dark cross-bars or blotches. Evermann and Bean 

 record four examples from Indian River at Titusville, Florida." They 

 give D. 11 and A. 8. ]\Iore recently, Evermann and Hildebrantl 

 record an example Ij inches long from St. Georges Island, Maryland, 

 and another 2 inches long from Gloucester Point, \'irginia.''-' They 

 give D. 10, A. 8. 



On December 15. 191.'), Mr. K. M. Abbott sicurcd an (>\aniple 

 45 mm. long at South River. It has D. 11 and A. 9. When cap- 

 tured it was clinging to an oyster, dredged up in the river, and was 

 received in fresh condition. Its coloration was so much in agreement 

 with that given for G. viryatuhis Jordan and (lill)ert,''* described from 

 Pensacola, and later recorded by Jordan'^ from Egmont. Florida, 

 that a careful comparison convinces me they are identical, and that 

 6'. vinjatulns Jordan and Gilliert must be merged in the synonymy. 

 There is absolutely nothing in tlieir description not applicable to my 

 specimens. The known range of G. stnimos7is will then extend from 

 the upper Chesapeake Bay and Maryland to Ptuisacola. Florida. 

 My entire series range from 30 to 77 mm., including additional 

 material, also from South River, recently received.

 Eulamia commersonii (MUinvilli) 



A head of a slight iy larger exampN' than uuy identified as Eulamia 

 poroHus, shows .several characters not in agreement. The nostril 

 as .seen in profile begins nearly midway in the length of the snout 

 and nasal valves with only \vy\ obtuse wide point at hind angles, 

 whereas in E. ixnosus the point is distinct and projecting. Each 

 mouth corn<'r with a c<jnspicuous though very short fold. Teeth 

 all very finely serrate. \o pores on lower internasal sj>ace as in 

 E. porosiis, those above rictus and in postorbilal region inconspicuous, 

 whereas in E. parosus the reverse obtain>. 



Miller and Heiile state' "Maul .schwach konvex." Their figure 

 of the lowi-r view of the head does not show any distinct point to 

 the ends of the nasal lobes, and there is no indication of a fold at tin- 

 mouth corner. It also shows the spa«"e betwt'en the snout tip and 

 mouth about an eye-diameter greater than the space between the 

 outer nasal corners, which is not in agreement with my specimen. 

 The short labial groove at each mouth angh' an<l the width of the 

 orbit half of spac«* to nostril are points in agreement with my material.

 jaw and snout tip slightly less than snout measured from its tip to 

 eye. All have a distinct projecting point to the na.'sal valve. Very 

 slight outer fold at mouth corner. 



Ranzani's lateral figure- shows the nostril near the last fourth of 

 the snout as seen in profile. His lower view of the head shows it 

 slightly behind middle in snout length, as measured from snout tip 

 to eye. Also the mouth length is shown greater than its Avidth 

 and without any trace of a short groove at the outer corners. His 

 specimen was about 1.171 mm. long.

THE ANATOMY OF AN EOLID, CHIORJERA DALLI. 

 BY HAROLD HEATH. 



In 1852 Gould' dcscrihod a species of nudil)ranch, dredged in three 

 fathoms of water at Fort Discovery, Puget Sound, establishing for 

 it a new genu.s, Chioroera, whose translated diagnosis is as follows: 

 Boily limaciform, head very large, pedunculate, semiglohose; oral 

 face ventral, discoidal; mouth longitudinal, surrounded by a double 

 series of cirri; cephalic tentacles foliate,- retractile; branchial folds 

 fan-shaped, arranged in a series on each side; genital opening removeil 

 from the almost dorsal anus." The species is further characterized 

 by a pearly and whitish-colored body finely reticulated with orange. 

 The cirri likewise are orange colored, and the cephalic tentacles are 

 capable of retraction within a special sheath. The total length of 

 the boiiy is five and one-fourth inches. 



On the 20th of July. 19i;i, I collected a number of specimens of 

 what appear to be a new species of this genus in Rose Inlet on the 

 eastern shore of Dall Island in southeastern Alaska. Two days later 

 a few other individuals were taken in Hecate Strait near Hetta on 

 the western coast of Prince of Wales Island. To Mr. \V. F. Thomp- 

 son I am indebted for additional material collected at Echo Harbor 

 and S»>well Inlet on the eastern coast of the (^ueen ('harlott** Islands. 



The present species appears to l)e largely contined to the littoral 

 zone, as the larger number of specimens were collected on alga* in 

 shallow water. Nevertheless, a considerable numl)er were found 

 swimming near the surface, in .some instances fully three hundretl 

 yards from shore. As they crawl about the great head is frequently 

 contracted with consid('ral)le violenct', possibly for tin* j)urpose of 

 dislodging small organisms which serve as food. Sections of the 

 alimentary canal, however, show it to be entirely empty, in all of the 

 individuals critically examined, with tlu' exception of one containing 

 a few diatoms, so that we hav»' little information indeed concerning 

 the usual l)ill of fare. In the act of swimming the head is contracted 

 as nnich as possibh* an<l the body is strongly flexi'd from side to side. 

 Large numbers of eggs were fotmd attached to "eel grass" and 

 imbedded in gelatinous, spirally wound folds after the fashion of 

 many nudibranchs.

The following; are the measurement.^* of the largest specimen: 

 total length three inehes, diameter of head one and one-half inches, 

 greatest width of body one-half inch, greatest width of foot one- 

 fourth inch, greatest height of body three-fourths inch. No pig- 

 ment is visilile in the skin of living animals, though the body wall 

 has a milky appearance and is sufficiently transparent to show the 

 light blue and reddish viscera within. 



External Features. — The body (PI. XI, fig. 1) comprises two 

 distinct divisions, the head and body proper. The head presents 

 the appearance of a low vault or cowl provided with two dorsal tenta- 

 cles, two sets of marginal tentacles and on its under surface bears 

 the mouth. Unlike Chiorara leonina, the dorsal tentacles are not 

 retractile, and in preserved material are plain, muscular, foliaceous 

 outgrowths. Gould states that the tentacles of C. leonitia bear on 

 their anterior margins "an opaque, whitish papilla, presenting 

 something of a spiral or lamellar structure." Nothing of the kind 

 has been found to exist in the present species. 



The marginal head tentacles form two series, an outer set com- 

 prising from fifty to seventy-five large, slender processes, and an 

 inner fringe formed of much smaller outgrowths of approximately 

 double the number. Each of these cirri is provided with a nerve 

 (PI. XI, fig. 2) and gives evidence of being a tactile organ, though 

 observations along this line were very incomjilete. 



The mouth presents the appearance of a longitudinal slit (PI. XI, 

 fig. 1) placed near the posterior margin of the head, and therefore 

 in close proximity to the anterior margin of the foot. Its posterior 

 border may be .said to be formed by the free border of the head, 

 which here forms a deep angle usually devoid of the larger type of 

 tentacle. Laterally and anteriorly the oral opening is surrounded 

 by prominent, swollen lips. In living and in certain i)reserv((l 

 specimens, the head region for some distance beyond the lips forms 

 a prominent swollen area, occasionally thrown into temporary 

 ridges. Sections show this area to be highly vascular. Unfortu- 

 nately, more pressing duties made it impossible to make careful obsiT- 

 vations on living animals, and an exact descri|)tion of the normal 

 appearance of this area is now impossible. It may be added that 

 in (lould's figure of ('. leoninn the mouth occupies a central position 

 beneath the cephalic vault or cowl, whose tentaculate iiiMPgin ciicom- 

 pa.s.ses it at a considerable distance. 



The V>ody, separated from the lund l)y a dist iict cleft forming a 

 neck, is roughly conical in form, and vent rally is travers«'d throughout 




1917.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 139 



its entire extent by a .slender foot. Dorsally it carrie.s a num])er of 

 lappet.s in two longitudinal series attached along the junction of 

 the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the body. All of the specimens 

 in hand were preserved in formaldehyde, and while this served 

 admirably to preserve the general appearance and proportion of 

 parts, practically all of the lappets were found to be detached when 

 the material was unpacked for study. It is certain, however, that 

 each lappet is attached to the body by a slender .stalk, and is leaf- 

 like in form. The only doubtful point concerns their exact number. 

 Judging by the slight circular scars where they were attached to the 

 body, there appear to be five on the left side and four on the right, 

 the place of the second largest one on the right being occupied In' 

 the anal opening. In a few large specimens there are traces of an 

 additional, very small pair near the posterior end of the body. Each 

 is penetrated by ramifications of the liver branches and by a system 

 of blood sinuses. 



The genital openings are on the right side of the body in the neck 

 region, while the anal opening is far removed on the dorsal side of 

 the animal. 



Internal Anatomy. — In this species no distinct visceral cavity or 

 spacious prinuiry body cavity exists, the various .systems of organs 

 Ix'ing surroumU'd by a loo.se meshwork of connective tissue and 

 muscle fibers with the intercommunicating spaces serving as bloofl 

 sinu.ses. Di.«<.section accordingly is a comparatively simple matt<'r, 

 and the dififerent sy.stems of organs, especially the nervous, have 

 Ix'en traced out in considerable detail. .\ description of each of 

 these will now be given. 



Considering first the digestive system, we find that the posterior 

 border of the snout is deeply cleft along the midline, and, lacking 

 the larger tentacles at this point, forms the ventral border of the 

 mouth opening. The remaining margin is fa.shioned into thick, 

 swollen, glandular lips united anteriorly, and of such length that the 

 mouth apprars as a longitudinal slit three or four millimcter«< in 

 ifiigth. 



The esophagus or pharynx (IM. XI, fig. 4) is a (M»iMi)aratiV(ly ^liort 

 tube, and owing to the ventral position (»f the mouth the ilorsal wall 

 is con.si<lerably longer than the ventral. Immediately beyond the 

 mouth opening the walls are relatively thick and without folds, but 

 a.s the brain ngion is approached the imier lining becomes thinner 

 and is thrown into numerous longitudinal folds. Probal)ly not less 

 than a dozen dig«><tive tracts were either sectioned or oprned care- 




140 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



fully, but in no instance was there a trace of jaws, radula or distinct 

 salivary glands. 



Posterior to the central nervous system the lining of the pharynx 

 becomes smoothed out l)efore uniting with the smooth-walled 

 stomach. Externally there are no noteworthy features to be noted 

 in this section of the gut. It may be said, however, that the stomach 

 is somewhat shorter than the pharynx and of consideraljly greater 

 diameter. On the left side of the stomach are two sac-like dilations 

 and one on the left, all of which are in communication with ducts from 

 the digestive gland. In sections the lining epithelium of each of 

 these sacs is seen to be thrown into a few high folds that are more 

 or less continuous with lower longitudinal ridges extentling throughout 

 the main hepato-pancreatic duct. 



As noted previously, the ventral gastric surface is longer in an 

 antero-posterior direction than the dorsal, and the intestine is thus 

 inclined dorsally, forming a distinct dorsal cleft between the stomach 

 and intestine. Beyond this point the gut proceeds posteriorly, 

 sinking slightly toward the ventral surface of the body, and also 

 curving to the right until it reaches a point on the right side of the 

 animal near the middle of the body. Here it curves dorsally, and 

 expanding consitlerably opens to the surface. The intestinal epithe- 

 lium is fashioned into several folds, visible externally through the 

 thin wall, of whicli one, the dorsal, is highly developed and continues 

 like a typhlosole throughout the entire length of the gut. 



In preserved material the yellowish digestive gland is seen through 

 the translucent body wall in the form of a dense mat generally dis- 

 tributed throughout the l)ody, penetrating the lappets and extend- 

 ing into the snout as far forward as the tentacles. As can be seen 

 in the figures, the follicles are united by an extensive system of 

 <lucts, which finally communicate with the stomach by means of 

 one of the three openings noted i)reviously. 



The circuhitory system can be disposed of in a few words, as the 

 sinuses are innisually delicate and difficult to follow. The pericar- 

 dium ( PI. X 1 1 1, fig. bi), situated anterior to t he rectum, is a spacious 

 thin-walled sac, with the ventral and posterior surfaces largely con- 

 cealed by a rna.ss of excretory tubules. The heart compri.ses an 

 aurir-le and ventricle with their longitudinal axes directed in a dorso- 

 ventral direction. The aorta, leaving the dorsal margin of the 

 pericardial cavity, extends forward and soon disa|)|)ears. On the 

 other hand, the .sinuses entering the auricle lia\e been traced into 

 the kidney and to a much less degree into the reproduct iv<' system 

 un<l liviT. 




1917.1 NATUR-^.L SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 141 



The kidney (PI. XIII. fig. 13) lies on the dorsal side of the body, 

 immediately above the anterior half of the hermaphroditic gland. 

 In two specimens it was relatively thin and sheetlike, while in half 

 a dozen other cases it occupied practically all of the space between 

 the ovote.stis and the body wall. As may be seen in fig. 13, the 

 most conspicuous feature of the excretory system is a long and 

 slender, thin-walled reservoir, somewhat crescent-shaped in lateral 

 view. The form, however, is more or less irregular, owing to great 

 numbers of diverticula springing from its surface. Each diverticu- 

 lum divides several times, the numl)er of divisions correspon<Iing 

 roughly to its diameter, until it finally breaks up into a number of 

 thin-walled, transparent, blind-ended tubes comprising the major 

 portion of the kidney. 



From the central and most elevated portion of the main reservoir 

 a wide cylindrical duct arises, which, narrowing as it pursues a 

 cour.<e dorsally, opens upon the surface of the body im the left side 

 of the anal opening. For a portion of the distance this canal is in 

 contact with the rectum, and the excretory and anal openings are 

 accordingly very clo.se together. As indicated by the drawing 

 (fig. .13), the ureter bears .several excretory tliverticula, and becomes 

 muscular and non-glandular only in the neighborhood of the external 

 opening. The reno-jx-ricardial canal likewise is borne <m the dorsally 

 directed ureter in the form of a short, inconspicuous tube, terminating 

 in nmch folded, ciliated nephrostome. 



The reproductive system forms a conspicuous and compact mass 

 in the po.sterior half of the body (PI. XII, figs. C, 8, \)). Of the 

 various component elements, the gonad, occupying the posterior 

 half of the visceral cavity, is the largest and i)resents the apjiearance 

 of a slender conical organ comprising va.st numl)ers of lobules. In 

 section each of these is seen to be compo.sed of several short acini 

 comnumicating near the «>xcurrent duct with a common chamber. 

 Spermatozoa are developeil in the more central acini, while tho.«^e 

 more externally placed contain ova only. 



From each lobule of the gonad a slender duct arises, unites with a 

 corresponding duct from .soujc other lobule, and ihvav unite with 

 other and larger tubes, until finally the resulting main duct, the 

 hermaphroditic canal, is formed that courst's along the entire ventral 

 face of the gonad. At the anterior border of the gonad it expands 

 perceptibly, and in the form of a yellowish, smooth-walled structure 

 undergoes a few twists, and upon decrea.sing its diameter divides into 

 two branches, the oviduct and vas deferens, respectively. 




142 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



The oviduct (Ov), the more dorsal of the two branches, comprises 

 three main divisions, of which the first is relatively the most slender 

 and forms a highly convoluted mass at the anterior end of the gonad 

 at a somewhat higher level than the remaining elements of the 

 accessory reproductive apparatus. This first section passes abruptly 

 into the second, which is characterized by a greater diameter, much 

 more highly developed muscular walls, and a more open arrangement 

 of the coils. Near its union with the third division, comprising the 

 albumen and mucous glands, it communicates with a slender seminal 

 receptacle (Sr), empty in all of the dozen specimens examined. The 

 mucous gland (Mu) is considerably larger than the albumen, with 

 relatively smooth, thin walls thrown into gentle folds internally. 

 The albumen gland (Al), on the other hand, is externally folded to a 

 conspicuous degree, especially in its distal half. It communicates 

 at its base with the mucous gland, and the secretory products from 

 both make their way by a common canal which unites with the main 

 section of the oviduct close to the external reproductive opening. 



The vas deferens (Vd) enters almost immediately a compact gland, 

 possibly functioning as a prostate, l)y means of several slender ducts 

 which communicate in turn with numerous blind, finger-shaped 

 hollow processes (Pa). Sections show these follicles to be composed 

 of large, highly glandular cells, from many of which the secretion is 

 in the act of escaping in the form of a finely granular colorless product. 

 In some iastances the hermaphroditic duct and the adjacent section 

 of the vas deferens contain multitudes of spermatozoa; none occur 

 in the supposed prostate. Beyond the prostate gland the vas 

 fleferens proceeds as a uniformly slender, much convoluted tube 

 located immediately in front of the prostate, Distally it opens into 

 the penis, a thick-walled, twisted structure communicating with the 

 i'Xterior by means of a pore immediately anterior to that of the female 

 reproductive opening. A retractor nmsde attaches to the base of 

 the penis, and extending posteriorly divides, each half becoming 

 inserted in the body wall about opposite the lateral border of the foot. 



The central nerv(jus system, presenting the highly compact 

 appearance of the ajolids in general, rests upon the dorsal surface of 

 the esophagu.s or pharynx a short distance in front of the anterior 

 border of the stomach. The cerebral ganglia are in close contact 

 along the mid line, and posteriorly are closely united with the pleural 

 ganglia. The lateral portions of the cerebral moiety are prolonged 

 into short horn.s. On each side of the mi<l line a short connective 

 lead** from the posterior b(»nl(r of the cerebral ganglion and unites 




1917.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADKLI'HI A. 143 



with a correspoiuling tt'iitacular ganglion. Each of these last-named 

 bodies is relatively small and rests in a depression between the 

 cerebral ganglia, and in every specimen carefully examined the left 

 is grooved and is considerably larger than the right. The pleural 

 ganglia are more or less spherical bodies separated l)y a shallow 

 depression from the cerebral and by a much deeper constriction from 

 the pedal, which are therefore more clearly defined. The cerebral 

 ganglia give rise to two or three pairs of nerves whose lettering in the 

 following paragraphs is the same as in the figures. 



C'l, a nerve to the snout. In some instances this nerve has an 

 independent origin; in other cases (as in PI. XI, fig. 2, on the right 

 side) it arises as a branch of C2. In any event, it soon divides re- 

 peatedly, and, so far as traced, forms a i)lexus, with ganglia at the 

 nocU's, that extends over the base oi the snout in the middle area. 



C2 is a heavy nerve extending through the loose tissue of the 

 snout in the direction of the tentacle. About the middle of its 

 length it divides, each half with its branches i)assing to the inside or 

 the outside of the tentacle. The inner l)ran(h. after developing a 

 few filxTs, sui)i)lying the more median portion of the hea<l, extends 

 forward to the margin of the cowl. The outer branch, after dividing 

 once or twice, likewise pursues a coursr to the margin. At the 

 Itorder of the cowl all of these nerves unite with an irregular nerve 

 lying at the base of and supplying both sets of margiiuil tentacles. 



C3 extends from each cerebral ganglion into the lateral portions 

 of the cowl. After branching three times the resultant nerves unite 

 with the marginal nerve. A short distance beyond its point of origin 

 a connective unites C3 with ('2. 



C'x, a nerve springing froni the ventral surface of each cerebral 

 ganglion close to tlie cerebro-buccal connective (PI. XIII, fig. IDj. 

 Extending anteriorly and vent rally, it enters the inferior wall of the 

 esophagus. There are indi<-ations that it anastomoses with some of 

 the nerves developed from the anterior surface of the buec.il ganglion, 

 but this has not been conclusively established. 



('4, the tentacular nerve, which pursues a direct course from each 

 tentacular ganglion into the tentacle, where it rapidly disapjH'ars 

 from view among the (len.sc mass of muscle fibers. 



Each otocyst rests upon the dorsal surface of the central nervous 

 system at the junction oi the cerebral and pedal ganglit)n. In 

 preserved material in surface view it appears as a yellowish, spherical 

 body resting in a shallow cup of black pigmented cells. Xo sections 

 of it were made. 




144 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



Two pairs of nerves, in addition to the two commissures (Pc), 

 arise from the pedal gangha. The first of these is — 



PI, a fairly heavy bundle springing from the side of the ganglion. 

 Coursing tii rough the dense mat of muscle and connective tissue 

 composing the botly wall, it extends posteriorly and ventrally, and 

 divides at the junction of the body and head (PI. XIII, fig. 11). The 

 anterior branch supplies the body wall adjacent to the head, and 

 sends a ventrally directed division to join the extensive plexus 

 located in the foot. The posterior branch is distributed over the 

 antero-lateral body wall, and in some instances also appears to be 

 connected with the pedal plexus, though this has not been estabhshed 

 with complete certainty. 



P'2 is a nerve likewise originating from the lateral surface of the 

 pedal ganglion, but posterior to the foregoing nerve. Extending 

 laterally and posteriorly, it divides opposite to the stomach into an 

 anterior and posterior branch. The anterior division supplies the 

 body wall posterior to the area adjacent to the external reproductive 

 opening, and, extending to the foot, unites wuth the pedal plexus. 

 The posterior branch continues posteriorly to a point about opposite 

 to the level of the vas deferens, where it divides. The ventral 

 division pursues a fairly direct course to the foot, where it unites 

 with the pedal plexus. The dorsal branch continues its way along 

 the .side of the body to the po.sterior end of the animal. Throughout 

 its course it develops at least four connectives which unite with the 

 pedal plexus. Approximately one-third of its length beyond the 

 point of origin, P2 gives rise to two dorsally directed branches. The 

 anterior one passes forward and appears to anastomose with nerves 

 from offshoots of x and y (fig. 12) arising from the pleural ganglion. 

 The posterior Ijranch, a slender nerve, pursues a course })osteriorly 

 and dorsally, and more or less parallel with P2 extends to the hinder 

 end of the l)ody. Tlirougliout its extent it (level()i)s four branches, 

 which pa.ss into the dorsal lappets and about the anal opening, since 

 thi.s normally replaces one of the lappets on the right .side. 



The pedal ganglia an- uitih-d l)y Iwo coniniissures (Pc), the lieavier 

 one being anterior. 



Four pairs of nerves usually pass out from the ])i('ural ganglia. 

 In certain cases this may become obscured on one or both sides 

 through fusion or the presence of lieavy connectives. In addition 

 to these paired nerves, a single one — 



(1, appears on the right side (P!. XIII, figs. 11, 12), emerging at a 

 point close to the union of the pedal and i)leural ganglia. Coursing 




1917.) NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 145 



ventrally and posteriorly, it finally reaches the region of the accessory 

 reproductive apparatus, where it breaks up into several distinct 

 branches. One of these disappears from view among the coils of 

 the vas deferens, two or three minute twigs enter the penis, and in 

 two specimens nerves have been traced into the seminal receptacle 

 and into the oviduct adjacent to its external opening. 



PU arises from the antero-ventral border of the pleural ganglion. 

 In one case it was represented bj' two nerves, but whether single or 

 paired, it directs its course dorsally, and branching repeatedly is 

 distributed to the dorsal body wall in the neck region. 



P12, a somewhat stronger nerve than PU, near which it originates, 

 extends in a postero-dorsal direction and after giving off one or two 

 small nerves enters the most anterior and largest lappet. 



P13 arises close to P12, at times fused with it basally, and likewise 

 courses dorsally and posteriorly as far backward as the anal opening. 

 Throughout its extent it gives off branches to the first lappet, which 

 is also innervated by a branch from P12, and also to the second and 

 third lappets. As the third lappet has no counterpart on the right 

 side of the body, the corresjionding nerve is distributed to the region 

 about the anus. Attention has been called to the fact that the 

 third lappet and anal region are likewise innervated by branches of 

 P2. 



P14 courses vtmtrally and after dividing becomes lost in the con- 

 nect iv(! tissue and muscle fibers of the body wall clo.se to the anterior 

 margin of the foot. 



Buccal System. — From the postero-ventral face of the cerebral 

 ganglia the cerebro-buccal coimectives arise, and coursing around 

 the si(h's of the pharynx or esojjhagus unite with the buccal ganglia 

 (Pi. XIII, fig. 10, B) at the sides of the digestive tract. The buccal 

 ganglia are more or less globular bodies, and in addition to the 

 cercbr()-l)uccal connectives each is attached to three other nerves, 

 of which one is the commissure extending beneath the pharynx to 

 join its fellow of the opposite side. Of the remaining two nerves 

 one is comparatively short, and extending anteriorly unites almost 

 immediately with a nerve originating more dorsally from the cerebro- 

 buccal connective. Beyond this point of union the combined bundle 

 extends anteriorly and ventrally, and after forming a plexus becomes 

 lost among the mu.scles of the pharynx. The last buccal nerve to be 

 cotJsidtTcd i)ursues a posteriorly direeted course from the buccal 

 ganglion, and very soon unites with the smaller of the two pedal 

 commLssures. Posterior to this point it continues along the sides of 

 10

the pharynx to a point about midway between the level of the central 

 nervous system and the first liver pouch. Here it divides, one branch 

 extending dorsally to enter the pleural ganglion or the base of P13, 

 while the ventral branch is directed to the ventral wall of the pharjTix 

 where it breaks up into several branches. Both of these last-named 

 nerves give rise to a single offshoot, each of which continues backward 

 to the anterior border of the first liver pouch where they enter a 

 strong, ganglionated commissure, passing over the dorsal wall of 

 the pharjTix. The lower of the two nerves just mentioned develops 

 a nerve, before entering the dorsal commissure, which is directed 

 posteriorly beneath the first liver pouch and branches over the 

 ventral wall of the stomach. Another nerve, having a similar 

 course, arises from the ganglion, and curving around the ventral 

 margin of the pouch becomes lost on its walls after branching two 

 or three times. 



As noted previously, the dorsal buccal commissure is ganglionated 

 at the point of union with the two nerves connected more anteriorly 

 with the buccal ganglion, and posteriorly this ganglionated section 

 extends along the sides of the stomach to the posterior border of 

 the first liver pouch. From it a clearly defined nerve arises, and 

 extending dorsally follows the bile duct into the liver proper, where 

 it breaks up and can be seen extending along some of the larger 

 follicles. At the posterior end of the liver pouch the buccal nerve 

 divides, the ventral branch supplying the liver pouch and the ventral 

 wall of the stomach. The dorsal branch extends posteriorly along 

 the sides of the stomach, and upon reaching the second liver pouch 

 forms several branches, all but one of which enter the liver pouch. 

 The exception is a distinct nerve (Bi) which continues along the 

 sides of the intestine, where it soon forms with its fellow a plexus 

 that has been followed to the anal opening. There are indications 

 that in the anal region this plexus h>ecomes continuous with branches 

 from P13 or P2, which, as noted previously, are distributed to the 

 body wall about the anus. 



From the foregoing paragraphs it will be seen that the head, 

 tentacles and otocysts are innervated solely by nerves from the 

 cerebral ganglia. The neck region is supplied with branches (PI 1 , 

 P14) from the pleural ganglia. The entire ventral half of the body 

 proper and the posterior d(jr.sal half is provided with nerves (PI, P2) 

 from the pedal ganglia. The remaining dorsal half is furnished with 

 offshoots from pleural ganglion nerves (V\2, PI3). The ventral 

 surface of the esophagus is innervated by nerves (C'xj from the 




1917.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 147 



ventral face of the cerebral ganglia. The stomach is supplied with 

 at least three pairs of nerves having their origin in the buccal system. 

 The liver pouches and gland itself like^vise derive their nerve supply 

 from the buccal nerve complex. From the same source a nerve on 

 each side of the intestine forms a plexus throughout the length of the 

 gut, and may connect with branches (P2c) from the pedal ganglia 

 or with others (P13) from the i)leural. The reproductive apparatus 

 is abundantly supplied with branches of the nerve G having its 

 origin in the right pleural ganglion. In two specimens tliere were 

 faint indications that delicate twigs from this same source enter 

 the heart and renal organ, but this was not definitely determined. 

 A brief diagnosis of the present species is herewith appended.

NEW MOLLUSCA OF THE SANTO DOMINGAN OLIGOCENE. 

 BY H. A. PILSBRY AND C. W. JOHNSON. 



The authors have had a revision of the fossils of Santo Domingo 

 and Haiti, chiefly contained in the William ]M. Gabb collection, in 

 preparation for some years. The work is now completed; but as 

 some months must elapse before the illustrations can be published, 

 advance descriptions are here given of most of the new forms. 



The age of the Santo Domingan beds covered by the collections of 

 Heneken and Gabb has been the subject of some uncertainty; but 

 it appears that the lower bed or beds, containing Orthaulox, are nearly 

 or quite equivalent to the Orthaulax pugnax zone of the Oligocene of 

 Tampa Bay, while the upper beds, furnishing most of the fossils, 

 are uppermost Oligocene, synchronous with the upper beds (Gatun 

 formation) of the Canal Zone. We have found no evidence of Plio- 

 cene or other beds between the Upper Oligocene and the Pleistocene. 



Illustrations of the species here described will appear in the com- 

 plete report, now awaiting publication.

Shell similar to A. tornaiilis of Europe in size and form, but as 

 coarsely .sculptured over the whole body-whorl as that species is 

 on the base. There are about 'Art subccpial sjjiral grooves on the last 

 whorl, cut into scjuare or ol)long pits by narrow vertical laiuclUe, 

 the grooves separated by flat-topped ridges which arc wider than 

 the intervals except on the base, where they lu'come narrow, no

 spiral sculpture of unequal cords and threads, which are weak w'here 

 they pass over the riblets. A narrow, convex posterior fasciole has 

 about fine, unequal spiral threads, and is defined by a rather deep 

 sulcHis, also striate. Pelow the sulcus there are al)out 7 unequal 

 cords, followed l»elow by a grou]) of finer threads. On the last whorl

 Drillia sororonla n sp. 



A shell with much the appearance of D. ischnatrada , but differing 

 by the nmch shorter aperture, less produced anterior canal, and the 

 absen.se of spiral striie in the intervals of the .spiral cords. The 

 latter are quite low and rounded, ecjual to their intervals. On the 

 last whorl there are 13 between the anal and siphonal fascioles, on 

 the whorls of the spire 5, with another following the suture. The 

 anal fasciole is excavated, without tlistinct spiral striation.

The penult whorl is crossed by about thirteen rather sharp axial 

 ribs which weaken abruptly where they cross the concave anal 

 fasciole. Some short ribs are intercalated on the last whorl. The 

 back is humped by a broad, i)rominent varix. The anal fasciole is 

 without spiral sculpture; below it there are six spiral grooves between 

 the ribs on the whorls of the spire, and on the last whorl about 

 fourteen, her«' pa.ssing over both valleys and ribs. The anal sinus 

 is deep. sr|)arated from the i)receding whorl by a heavy callous pad. 

 Siphonal fasciole is prominent.

fascicle. Between sutures there is a strongly undulating presutural 

 spiral followed by several very small spiral striae on the anal faseiole, 

 which is not excavated or concave, and three strong cords, a fourth 

 barely appearing al)ove the suture. Between these cords some very 

 fine and weak spiral striation is visible. On the last whorl there 

 are 17 spiral cords in addition to the presutural cord. There is a 

 strong varix a short distance l)ehind the lip. Anal sinus deep and 

 rounded.

It appears to stand close to D. severina Dall, but that species has 

 a wider, "distinctly excavated" anal faseiole, and a relatively 

 longer last whorl. 



Orillia callistara n. »p. 



The spire is straightly turrited, sculptured with regular, acute, 

 slightly protractive axial ribs, of which there are 18 on the penult 

 whorl. The ribs terminate abruptly above, leaving a narrow, deeply 

 concave anal faseiole which is bounded above by a spiral cord a little 

 distance below the suture. In the posterior faseiole and between 

 the axial ribs there are close, fine spiral threads, and weakly marked 

 growth-lines, more obliquely protractive than the ribs. On the 

 la.st whorl the ribs gradually diminish downward, and are wanting 

 on the narrow anterior end, and the lower half has rather coarse 

 spirals. A rather strong varix stands close behind the lip. There 

 are al^out 9 acute line within the outer lip. 



Length 22, diam. 8, length of aperture 9 mm.; 8 whorls remaining 

 in the type, which has lo.st the apical whorls. 



Tyi)e is No. 2907, A. X. S. P. One sijccimen. 



This species is closely related to I), jamaicensis Guppy {IJ. cbciiind 

 Dall). from which it differs by having the anal faseiole evenly and 

 flistinctly striated spirally, with no trace of the close, arcuate growth- 

 ridges, which predominate in jditKu'crusis. The anal sinus is not 

 nearly ho deep and not contracted in front. The throat is Urate. 

 The spin- has straight outlines. Finally, it attains a .somewhat 

 larger hize. 



Drillia iaohnatraota n. «p. 



The shell is fusiform, the t\v<i Mpic-i! whorls smootli, following 




1917.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 155 



whorls of the spire with about nine sHghtly protractive axial ribs, 

 which do not cross the concave anal fasciole. There are numerous, 

 acute, spiral threads alternating with smaller ones. On the penult 

 whorl there are seven of the larger threads below and two or three 

 ai)ove the anal fa-sciole. Between the alternating threads are still 

 finer spiral stria?. On the last whorl, where the axial ribs become 

 irregular, partly obsolete, the spiral sculpture remains the same; 

 there being about 28 larger spirals below the shoulder. The anal 

 fasciole is minutely striate spirally. 



Length 51.4, diam. 13.5 mm. 



Length 53.4, (ham. 13.5 mm., length of aperture 25.5 mm.: 11 

 postnepionic whorls. 



Type No. 2904. 



This differs from D. henckcni by the mf)re slender shape, with much 

 lower ribs, which become weak and irregular on the last whorl. The 

 inter-liral spaces are densely, finely striate, while in I), henekeni they 

 are smooth. 



In many specimens the spirals do not alternate in size as described 

 above, the intervals having fine, unequal or subequal spiral stria?. 



Drillia toala n. up. 



The shell is fusiform, whorls strongly convex, concave just below 

 the suture. Penult whorl with sixteen acute axial ribs, nearly 

 vertical except for a short backward curvature below the suture, 

 where the ribs diminish abruptly in size. In the intervals there are 

 fine, rounded, spiral threads, scarcely as wide as their interstices; 

 between them nuich more minute growth-lines may be seen. There 

 i.s a strong, latero-dorsal varix. The aperture is somewhat broken. 



Length 45.5, diam. 17 mm. 



This species resembles I), squattiosa in form Itut the ncutr not 

 nodose longitudinal ribs, the regular revolving sculpture at once 

 .separate it from that species. On the other hand it is related to 

 D. venustti but is at once distinguished by its long anterior canal, 

 fewer longitudinal ril)s and more lunnerous spirals. The fine linrs 

 of growth between the spiral lines are wanting in I), irnusta. 



Type and a i»roken specimen are No. 2932.

iu the intervals. Each whorl of the spire has two of these cords 

 below and one above the concave anal fascicle, in which a few weak 

 spiral strise may be seen. On the last whorl there are 11 spirals 

 below the fasciole, the intervals somewhat distinctly marked with 

 grovsi-h-striae. There is a stout varix behind the outer lip. The 

 aperture is rather narrow. 



Length 8, diam. 3.5 mm.; about G whorls remaining. 



The small number of spiral cords and very wide axial ribs dis- 

 tinguish this species. It is closely related to the Pliocene D. acuciiicta 

 Dall, 1890, a very much larger species. The strong varix behind 

 the lip of D. hexapleura shows that it is adult. 



Drillia mimula n. sp. 



The shell closely resembles D. parkeri in ribbing, except that the 

 ribs do not extend so far down on the last whorl. The wdiorls and 

 the whole shell are shorter, the last much more abruptly contracted 

 below. The smooth embryonic shell has only 1^ bulbous whorls, 

 the ribs beginning strongly in the middle of the second whorl. There 

 is a microscopic sculpture of crowded spiral striae. Aperture broken. 



Length 16.5 mm. (broken anteriorly), diam. 5.8 mm.; nearly 10 

 whorls. 



Type No. 2925. 



Drillia esculenta " ^]> 



The shell is fusiform, of 10 whorls, the first 2h forming the 

 embryonic shell are smooth and convex. Subsequent whorls are 

 concave in the upper third, then convex, with sculjiture of rounded, 

 slightly protractive axial ribs, which become lower and arched back- 

 ward as they cross the concave zone. There are 15 ribs on the penult 

 whorl; last whorl having a stout dorsal varix. A few ripples along 

 growth-lines may be .seen, more obliquely protractive than the ribs. 

 In the intervals and more weakly over the ribs there are crowded, 

 very fine spiral threads. The aperture is broken, but the inner lip 

 is continuous, rather heavy, and built forward. 



I^ength 13.3, diam. 5 mm. 



Three specimens are in the lot, the figured type having Ixmmi bored 

 by a predaceous gastropod. The minute sculpture dilTerentiates 

 it from other species of the same horizon.

Tin- shell is slender, fusiform, with sculpture of strong longitudinal 

 ribs, continuous from whorl to whorl, and smooth except for fine

growth-wrinkles. The ribs are lower on the anal fa.sciole, which is 

 limited below by an inconspicuous cord. The ribs disappear on the 

 anterior canal. The siphonal fascicle is banded above by an acute 

 cord. Columella is nearly straight. Outer lip broken. 



Length 14. diam. (estimated) 5 mm.; 8 whorls, several at the apex 

 lost. 



Type Xo. 8198. A. X. S. P. 



Drillia callistopleura n >\>. 



Shell fusiform, of l\\ whorls. Embryonic U whorls smooth, 

 the first one inflated; three following whorls are angular above the 

 suture, after which the whorls become convex, having slightly 

 protractive axial ribs and spirally striated intervals. On the penult 

 whorl there are nineteen a.xial ribs, which are slightly lower and a 

 little arcuate below the suture. Between the axial ribs, on the spire, 

 there are rounded spiral cords, about as wide as their intervals, 

 twelve on the penult whorl; on the last whorl they number about 

 thirty-six. Anteriorly the ribs weaken and the spirals pass over 

 them. There is a prominent dorsal varix. Aperture imi)erfect. 



Length 22.4, diam. 7 mm. 



The smooth axial ribs, and uniform, clo.se, revolving cords dis-

Clatharella arnica n. sp. 



Re^^enlbles C. gracilis. It is less slender and the whorls are shorter 

 and revolve less obliquely. It has the same number of axial ribs 

 and spiral threads, but, as they are relatively larger, they are much 

 more crowded than in C. gracilis. The fine spiral lines between the 

 prominent raised threads are very minute. The lip varix is noticea- 

 bly larger, and the mouth is wider; the callous nodule on the body 

 next to the sinus is much larger than in C. gracilis. 



Length 16.3, diam. 5.25 mm.; aperture 7.5 mm. 



It is allied to C. vendryesiana Dall,' but the prominent axial ribs 

 over the whole shell differentiate it.

Scobinella tristis n. sp. 



Tlic shell is fusiform with turrited spire. The whorls are strongly 

 angular at the shoulder, rather deeply concave between the shoulder 

 and a strong, beaded ridge below the suture. There are four spiral 

 cords in the concavity. At and below the shoulder there are about 

 24, deeply beaded spiral cords, the beads arranged in protractive 

 curves. On the penult whorl there are four spirals l)elow the shoulder, 

 which has a bifid spiral. The aperture is verj' narrow. The outer 

 lip of the tjT)e has been broken during the life of the animal, and is 

 thicker than normal, lirate within. The long, straight columella 

 bears two strong, mitriforiii plaits, and there is the faint trace of a 

 third one.

 apex; periphery carinate, the slopes below it nearly straight. The 

 early whorls have a smooth keel, projecting al>ove the suture, but 

 the la.st five are flat, with very weak traces of spiral stria?, and sepa- 

 rated by a plain, narrowly iinpre.ssed suture. The last whorl has 

 coarse, well separated spiral cortls on the anterior end, but under 

 suitably oblique light very faint .spirals may l)e seen throughout. 

 The faint growth-stria? retract rather strongly near the shoulder.

 2^ whorls this carina bears low nodes (about 20 on the last whorl), 

 but on the earlier whorls the keel is smooth. The upper slope of 

 each whorl has prominent, arcuate radial strise but no spirals. Below 

 the shoulder the surface is slightly convex, contracted a little above 

 the base. The lower half has about 13 spiral grooves, widely sepa- 

 rated except close to the base; and except on the anterior fourth 

 there are spiral series of small pustules which are slightly lengthened 

 in the axial direction, and are arranged in vertical rows, but some-

being contained in No. 2556, A. X. S. P. We are utterly at a loss 

 to account for Gabb's reference of the shell to C. cedo-nulli, which is 

 entirely different. 



The sculpture is rather variable, as usual in Co7ius some individuals 

 showing raised spirals nearly up to the shoulder, while in other the 

 upper half may be smooth. 



Conus pernodosus n. sp. 



The shell is rather slender, the diameter not quite half the length; 

 spire produced, slightly concave in the upper part, of about 9 whorls, 

 which are slightly concave and spirally striated above, with a pro- 

 jecting periphery which is set with somewhat pointed tubercles on 

 the last 3^ whorls. On the angle of the last whorl there are 11 

 tubercles. Below the angle the outline is very slightly convex. 

 Surface closely sculptured with flat-topped spiral cords about twice 

 as wide as the intervals (37 below the angle of last whorl); intervals 

 are sharply sculptured with axial threads. 



Length 23.3 (imperfect at base); diam. 12.3 mm. 



With the tj-pe, No. 2552, A. N. S. P., there are two young shells 

 about 15 mm. long, which show tubercles on the last whorl only. 

 The upper whorls, in this species, have a smooth, projecting periphery. 



Conus gabbi n. sp. 



The shell is rather slender, stoutly fusiform, with a concavely 

 conic spire of about 11 whorls; all post-embryonic whorls have a 

 tubercular keel projecting above the suture. Upper surface of each 

 whorl is slightly concave, with about 5 unequal spiral threads crossed 

 by prominent, arched, unccjual stria». Below the shoulder of the last 

 whorl the slope is at first convex, becoming slightly concave in the 

 lower part. It is sculptured with about 37 smooth, rounded spiral 

 ribs narrower than their intervals, which are elegantly cancellated 

 by close rai.'^ed axial tlin-ads. The aperture is rather narrow 

 throughout. 



Length 43, <liiiMi. 17.5 nun.; length of ajierture 35 nnn. 



The number and spacing of the .spiral ribs is somewhat variable. 

 In one? specimen 35 mm. long there are only 24 spiral ribs. Conus

 this specicH somewhat, but it hji.s fewer and flattened spirals, and 

 there are .some fine spiral threads in the furrows. It seems also to 

 be more contracted in the lower part.

The shell is extremely .slender, the length aljout 3§ times the 

 diameter, fusiform. Spire produced, composed of fiat whorls, the 

 beaded periphery projecting above the suture; apical whorls lost. 

 The last whorl is angular, the angle set with 25 bead-like tubercles, 

 which are a little lengthened in the s})iral direction; elsewhere, above 

 and below the angle, it has close, even fine spiral cords with very 

 sharp axial striation in the intervals. Upward, towal^ds the shoulder, 

 the striie slowly retract. The aperture is extremely narrow. The 

 inner lip is excavated in its lower fourth. 



Length (truncated) 33, diam. 9.5 mm.; 5.> whorls remaining. 



Type No. 2550, A. N. S. P. 



This species, ('. gabbi and C. pernodosus, were lumped by Gabb 

 under C. orbignyi Audouin, a recent species inhabiting the Eastern 

 Seas. C. gracillssiinuti (luppy, from the Oligocene of Jamaica, is 

 clo.sely allied, but it is a distinct species, with wide, flat, revolving 

 costae. 



C. larvatus is narrower than ('. lortuofio.stn'oh(,s Toula, and differs 

 conspicuously in contour. Toula's species has iiujre resemblance to 

 (\ gracilissimus Cluppy. 



Canoellaria gabbiana n. np. 



The shell is short, turbinate solid, of al)()ut 7 whorls. The bulbous 

 eml)ry()nic shell consists of l^ convex, smooth whorls. Following 

 whorls have slightly retractive axial ribs much narrower than their 

 intervals, about 18 on the la.st whorl. At intervals of about a half 

 whorl there are rather broad varices. There are 18 .spiral cords 

 hardly half as wide as their intervals and pa-ssing over ribs and 

 varices. Siphonal fasciole is prominent, surrounding a small um- 

 bilicus. The apcrturr is large, oval; outer lip is .somewhat efTuse 

 at the outer-basal i)art, but not retracted; .sculptured within with 

 14 sharp line. Columellar plaits are not very strong, the upper one

Type is No. 2989, A. N. S. P. 



This species is not at all like the recent C. brevis Sowb. It closely 

 resembles C. perspeciiva Conr., of the Chesapeake Miocene, but 

 differs in its more rugose aperture and narrow, irregular ribs, which 

 in C. perspediva are wide and regularly alternating. The aperture 

 and umbilicus are larger than in C. depressa Dall, of the Tampa 

 silex beds. It differs conspicuously from C. moorei Guppy in the 

 basal region. 



A Trigonostoma figured by Toula, referred to above, appears to be 

 close to C. insularis, perhaps specifically identical. 



Oliva proavia n. sp. 



Olira cijlindrica Sby., Gabb. Tr. Amer. Philos. Soc, XV, 1873, p. 215 {pars

The shell is somewhat fusiform, the upper fourth of the last whorl 

 and the spire tapering, forming a straight ly conic spire. In its even 

 surface the suture appears as an engraved groove, the individual 

 whorls being flat. The first two whorls form a minute, mammillate 

 ai>ex. Whorls 9. The aperture occupies almo.st exactly J of the 

 total length. Columella is rather heavily calloused, and bears about 

 21 very oijlique plaits, of which all but about 10 in the median part 

 are cjuite small. There are faint traces of a color pattern resembling 

 that of (). sayana Rav.

 tour and much more obli(|ue columellar folds of (). proavia. A further 

 important distinction is that the lateral contours of the spire are 

 continuous across the suture in proavia, \\\\\\i\ in the other species 

 the posterior edge of eaeh wliorl prctjects beyund the pirccding. 




1917.1 NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 165 



The tjTDC specimen is quite perfect except that the lip is somewhat 

 crushed in above, making the aperture appear shorter and narrower 

 above than it really is. 



Oliva dimidiata n. ap. 



The shell is small, cylindric, with conic spire and mamillate ape.x. 

 The last three to four whorls are flat, covered with callous, and 

 separated by channelled suture. The last whorl is encircled a little 

 above the middle by a narrow groove. The basal fasciole has 6 

 strong ledges. There are 14 short folds on the columellar margin. 



Length 12.2, diam. oM mm.; length of aperture 9 mm.; 61 whorls. 

 Others measure 11.5 and 13 nun. long. 



This was at first suspected to be a young stage of 0. gradata; but 

 that species is longer when it has the same number of whorls. More- 

 over, the narrow ledge of gradata is unlike the groove of this species. 

 It is closely related to the recent 0. undatella Lam. of the west Mexi- 

 can coast but is less inflated, and to judge by the three examples 

 in the typical lot, it does not become so large.

 spiral impressed lines which do not pass over the smooth summits 

 of the ril)s. There are 7 or 8 such impressions in each interval on 

 the penult whorl. On the narrow anterior half of the last whorl 

 there are well .separated spiral cords. The outer lip is sculptured

 with about 27 straight, axial riblets at least as wide as their intervals; 

 no spiral sculpture above the periphery; below it there are fine spiral 

 lines between the riblets, and on the anterior third about 8 spiral 

 cords. The aperture is about half the total length of the shell. 



Length 4.7, diam. 2 mm. 



Two specimens were found in the lot of A. exilis. As both are 

 immature, the aperture cannot be described; but the characteristic 

 sculpture, unlike any other shell of these beds, will insure recognition 

 of the species. Type and another are No. 2803, A. N. S. P. 



Another species of Columbellid is represented by specimens too 

 imperfect for diagnosis. 



Strombina polititiima n. «p. 



TIk; si)ir<' tiii^rs regularly, and is composed of 7 convex whorls, 

 .separated by an impressed suture, which does not ascend in front. 

 .\ prominent, rounded varix strengthens the lip, which has a small 

 tubercle within near the posterior insertion, another at the beginning 

 of the anterior canal. There is a small entering callus on the 

 parietal wall posteriorly. Surface smooth and highly polished 

 except at the ba.se, where there are about 14 obliquely spiral cords.

One specimen wa.s found with the large lot of ^'. haitensis. It 

 resembles that species in shape but not in sculpture. 

 M etalella dominicensis n. sp. 



The long spire has very slightlj^ concave outlines. The embryonic 

 shell is glossy and smooth, of If convex whorls, the first one rather 

 large. Following whorls are very slightly convex, angular a short 

 distance above the suture, which is in a channel. Sculpture of close, 

 fine axial ribs, at first ^nuooth, but at the third a few weak spiral 

 cords appear, stronger in the intercostal spaces. On the penult 

 whorl there are 3 or -i such cords; on the last whorl about 5 from the 

 peripher}' up; just below the periphery there is a zone without spirals, 

 then about 20 stronger spirals on the lower part. There are about 

 7 teeth within the outer lip, and 5 or 6 on the columella. 



Length 10.4, diam. 5.2 mm.; Si whorls. 



Type No. 3217, A. X. S. P. 



Closely related to M. fusiformis, but the whorls are less convex, 

 the spiral sculpture far weaker anfl the shell is more slender. 



Thaii santodomingensis n. sp. 



The shell is somewhat biconic, with short, straightly conic spire 

 and weakly angular periphery. Suture Ijordered below with an 

 irregular, .somewhat scabrous rounded ridge or welt; a somewhat 

 nodose low rounded ridge runs in the anterior concavity. Sculpture 

 of numerous vertical ribs on the upper and miiklle part of the whorls, 

 strongest at the periphery, ten on the last whorl, and many spiral 

 cords in strong relief. Siphonal fa.sciole prominent, uml)ilical 

 crevice open. The aperture has a shallow posterior channel and 

 the usual deep anterior notch. Columella is heavy rounded and 

 straight. 



Length 4.'). diam. 30 nun.; oj whorls. 



Type No. 3187, A. N. S. P. 



This species may be compare(l with the recent Cariblu'an Thais 

 curonata (Lam.j. It differs in sculpture, having rounded ribs in the 

 peripheral region, where it is indistinctly angular. In T. coronnta 

 the later whorls are distinctly shouldered. There is a spiral ridge 

 in the concavity below, which is wanting in T. cormmUi. 

 Malea eUiptioa n. op 



The shell is narrower than M . ctununi, with a longer spire. Sculp-

much wider than the intervals. Three spirals below the suture are 

 narrow. On the penult whorl there are five subequal wide spirals 

 besides three subsutural narrow ones, the intervals traversed by 

 fine threads. The last whorl has twenty wide and three narrow 

 spirals. The aperture is narrow. Lip having about the same 

 structure as in M. camnrn. There is a large parietal tooth, with 

 smaller ones above and i^elow it, and a prominent, double, columellar 

 tooth; the columella and the upper part of the parietal wall strongly 

 rugose. 



Length 53.5, diam. 34.7 mm.; 5f whorls remaining, the tip wanting. 



Type No. 2590. 



The very much less raised and more numerous spirals, as well as 

 the general shape of the shell, separate this from M. camura. 

 Malea goliath n. sp. 



Large and globose, thin, with sculpture of broad, flat spirals 

 parted by furrows from one-fourth to one-third as wide, 19 spirals 

 on the la.st whorl, five on the penult and next earlier, where the 

 median one is larger and prominent. Perietal tooth composed of 

 four plaits. Columellar prominence with about six plaits, the 

 upper three larger. Outer lip broken, but fragments indicate struc- 

 ture similar to M. camura.

Related to S. (jallK.s L. The spire is high, with sculpture of axial 

 riblets and inconspicuous varices on the earlier whorls, changing 

 to short tubercles on the last four, the penult whorl having two 

 low, massive varices. Whorls of the spire having uiiefjual spiral 

 stria?. The la.st whorl has a smooth shoulder in front, three high 

 tubercles on the back, the central one largest; the whole surface 

 having widely spaced spiral ridges and fine, very weak, spiral striie. 

 Lip j)ro<luced upward in an angle, smooth within; no entering wrin- 

 kles on the posterior end of columellar lip. 



Length 1(K), diam. ()() mm.; 9^ whorls. 



In the recent .S. yallua the lip is far more produced upward ami it 

 spreads on the left side above the shoulder; the spiral ridges on the 

 back are coarser, and the tubercles at the shoulder nujre numerous. 

 1 he new form is more like S. peruvianu.s in form of the lip, but that 

 species has the throat conspicuously rugose.

Strombus dominator n. sp. 



Slrombus gigns Linn., Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc, XV, p. 234. 



A species related to S. costalus (accipitrinus). Spire not very 

 high, the whorLs having rounded tubercles on the periphery, and 

 spiral striiP. The la.^t whorl ha.-^ a strong, rounded keel at the 

 shoulder, a .stout, triangular tubercle in the midille of the back, 

 preceded by another on the side. There is an inferior series of small 

 tul)ercles, and on the latter part of the whorl, some low, coarse 

 spiral ridges. The lip spreads broadly and is much thickened 

 within. Posteriorly it extends above the apex. The throat is smooth. 



Length 88, diam. 75 mm. Length of aperture (measured from 

 end of canal to upper end of the lip) 97 mm. 



The type is an almost perfect l)ut dwarf specimen. Several 

 fragmentary specimens are much larger, the be.st one about 15 cm. 

 long. The outer lip of another indicates a length of perhaps 20 cm. 

 It was apparently the mere size, rather than any close correspondence 

 of form or .sculpture, which determined Gabb's reference of the form 

 to N. (jigas. 



It is related to .S. eostotus and S. goliath, the spire being much like 

 the latter, which however, has the outer lip far more broatlly expand- 

 ing, and the upper margin quite different. In .S. eostotus the lip 

 falls short of the height of the spire, but in S. dominator it rises 

 above the apex. 



Type Xo. 257*X 

 Potamides gaitrodon n. np. 



The shell is rather short, conic, the whorls closely and regularly 

 .sculptured with axial riblets crossed by three spiral cords, forming 

 small tubercles at tin- intersections. There are a few inconspicuous 

 varices. La.st whorl ri.ses at the aperture, an<l has a prominent, 

 rounded varix on the left side; the cavity of the whorl at this place 

 having three well developed and a nunute fourth tooth within the 

 outer wall, a fold on the parietal wall near the posterior angle, and 

 a plait on the columella. Last half of the last whorl is broken away.

We have not been able to compare the type of Guppy's T. p ani-

 identification. Guppy has remarked, however, that his figure of 

 T. planigyrota "shows only the general shape."

The single specimen is not mature, but it may be recognized by 

 the sculpture. There are about 25 convex rings, more emphatic 

 posteriorly, lower anteriorly, their intervals much narrower than 

 the ribs, crossed and cut into pits by numerous low axial ril)s, which 

 appear very weakly on the rings. Septum rises in a point near the 

 convex side. 



Length 1.95, diam. 0.6 mm. 



The rings of C. crassicostum Gabb are very much stronger, the 

 intervals wider, so that, with a single example of each at hand, it 

 does not seem prudent to unite them as one species. 



Bifioa epalata n. »p. 



The shell is globose-conic and has a relatively large circular umbili-

 last whorl inflated. Sculj)ture of rounded vertical ribs about equal 

 to their intervals. 17 on the la.st whorl, dimini.shing and soon dis- 

 appearing after passing over the periphery. In the interco.stal 

 intervals there are very l<nv spiral cords, six above the periphery, 

 and the ba.se has four much stronger and more separated cords. 

 A broad and thick varix strengthens the outer lip. The ajxTture 

 is roundly ovate; peristome continuous.

Type No. 3107, A. X. S. P. 



The short form and large umbilicus are the chief characteristics

 ment. 

 Bissoa '^Alvania'* proavia n. sp. 



The shell is imperforate, rather plump, conic; first 2^ whorls are 

 smooth, convex, and form a somewhat acuminate summit. Following 

 whorls have latticed sculpture of rather narrow vertical ribs, which 

 pass over the periphery but are obsolete over most of the base, 

 crossed by spiral cords a little narrower than the ribs, and forming 

 small nodes at the intersections. On the penult whorl there are 

 three spiral cords, the upper one at the shoulder. On the last whorl 

 there are six spiral cords, the second from above forming the peri- 

 pher}', the lower two smooth, the others passing over ribs. Some 

 very minute spiral stria? are visiljle in the intercostal spaces. The 

 aperture is nearly circular, the lip strengthened by a strong varLx.

The shell is oval, obliciuely conic, with the apex curving backward

 at the summit, and is probably smooth, though somewhat worn, the 

 original surface being mostly removed. The later growth is rudely 

 ribbed radially with 14 ribs in a young si)ecimen ') mm. long,

180 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



In some shells the penult whorl does not descend more rapidly than 

 those preceding it. This gives the shell a contour somewhat different. 



This httle shell resembles Pyrgulopsis in shape. It also has much 

 in common with AcUs (Amblyspira) prominens Guppy of the Bowden 

 bed, but we can find no columellar plait in that species, which more- 

 over is decidedly larger. 

 Odostomia Eulimastoma) bathyraphe n. sp. 



The shell resembles 0. pyrgulopsis in umbilicus, surface and 

 general appearance, but differs as follows: The last whorl is more 

 strongly carinate; the whole shell is wider, summit more obtuse, 

 whorls less numerous. The tip of the first whorl is turned in, nuclear 

 whorls being presumably whollj' immersed. The suture is deeply 

 channelled from its beginning. 



Length 1.5, diam. 0.8 mm.; 45 whorls. 



Type No. 309L A. X. S. P. 



As in 0. pyrgulopsis, the columellar plait appears much larger in 

 an oblique view than in the face view drawn in the figures. 

 Odostomia (Evaleal) vezator n. sp. 



The shell is somewhat cylindric but tapers slowly upwards to a 

 very obtuse summit, which turns in at the tip, the nuclear whorls 

 being immersed. Subsequent whorls are flattened, excavated above 

 the suture, very narrowly shouldered below it, Avith sculpture of 

 fine lines of growth and numerous (about 15 on the penult whorl) 

 unequally spaced, verj' low and relatively coarse spiral stria. The 

 aperture is somewhat rhombic; columella thin, with a strong, short 

 plait. 



Length 1.0. diam. 0.0 mm.; 5i whorls. 



Type No. 3080, A. X. S. P. 



By Doctor Bartsch's key wo bring this species into the subgenus 

 Evalea. The deeply excavated suture and somewhat coarser spiral 

 scjilpture are differential characters, the suture, summit and general 

 shape of the shell agreeing with 0. santodomingejisis. We are there- 

 f(jre in doubt as to its subgeneric place. The columellar jilait shows 

 fully only in a somewhat oblicpie view, as it recedes somewhat. 



Besides the type and a broken specimen, there is a larger shell, 

 length 2.2, diam. 0.75 mm., otherw-ise similar. 



Odoftomia Ooniodoitomia) luperant n. *p. 



The shell is imperforate, oblong-conic, terminating in a very 

 obtUHO summit. Kmbrj'onic whorls immersed. First visible whorl 

 is strongly convex, its initial part a-scending. Following whorls are

flat, separated by a channelled suture, angular above and IjcIow it, 

 the lower angle becoming more prominent on the penult whorl, 

 forming a keel which continues at the periphery of the last whorl, 

 which is rather strongly concave above it, and slightly so below. 

 The surface is marked with faint growth-lines and many unequal 

 spiral striic. The aperture is ovate, somewhat oblique; columella 

 thick, l)earing a .stout oblique plait above. 



Length 1.85, diam. 0.9, length of aperture 0.(3 mm.; very nearly 

 5 whorls. 



Type No. 3090, A. X. S. P. 



This species is related to 0. circumvincta, but is wider, with a 

 stronger peripheral carina, a stronger columellar plait, and not so 

 many whorls. 



The spiral sculpture is indicated rather than drawn in the figures 

 of this species and the next. The spiral striae are very low, rounded, 

 unequal and unevenly spaced, but somewhat coarse and barely 

 visible with a good hand lens. 



As it cannot readily be fitted into any of the sections of Odostoruia, 

 we propose the new section (loniodostomia, for Odostomias without 

 axial ribs, having a peripheral keel and spiral striation, the columellar 

 plait emerging, nucleus wholly immersed. Type 0. superans. 



OdoBtomia (Ooniodostomia') oiroumvinota n. !>p. 



The shell is riiiuiti;, slowly tapering to the obtuse summit, the 

 em})ryonic whorls immersed, first visil)le whorl convex, turned in at 

 the tip; subsequent whorls flat, narrowly excavated above and nar- 

 rowly shouldered below the suture, which is therefore deei)ly chan- 

 nelled; la.st whorl angular or subcarinate at the periphery. Sculpture 

 of faint growth-lines and rather sparse unequal, low, spiral striie. 

 Ajx-rture ovate; columella thin, bearing a short fold above.

The specimen is an external mould of the spire, or part of it, in a 

 hard rock. It differs so conspicuously from A. longispina that we

This species is much less oblique than A. tolepia, and approaches 

 more to a circular shape. It is known by 5 valves and one pair. 

 The valves are remarkably thick. 

 Area perfaceta d. sp. 



The shell is nearly equivalve, inequilateral with large, inflated 

 beaks at the anterior fourth; extremely globose. Lower-basal angle 

 a httle produced. Sculpture, in the left valve of 24 ribs about as 

 wide as their intervals, and everywhere closely granose. Right 

 valve having the ribs much narrower than their intervals, smooth 

 in the median part, granose at the ends. Hinge rather short, with 

 13 teeth before, 25 behind an irregularity below the beaks. Margins 

 deep'y fluted.

Area cuneolus n. sp. 



The shell is thin, wedge-shaped, the anterior end short and very- 

 narrow, the posterior end very wide; beaks small, very convex the 

 convexity narrow; situated at theanterior two-fifths, turning somewhat 

 backward. Cardinal area small, not distinctly defined. Sculpture 

 of the convex and posterior parts of the shell of radial flattened, 

 partly bifid ribs alternat ng with narrow riblets, all roughened by 

 transverse granules; the anterior part of the shell having fine riblets 

 and minute concentric threads. Hinge narrow, the tooth-row con- 

 tinuous, of about 27 teeth, a group of very small ones under the beaks. 



Length 8.8, greatest width 6.25, diam. of left valve 3 mm. 



This peculiar species has a general resemblance in shape to Mac- 

 rodon asperula Dall, Area (Cucullaria) endemica Dall, and Area 

 culebrensis Smith. It differs widely from them in sculpture. We 

 know of no nearly related species. 

 Aroa idiodon n. sp. 



The cast is oblong, slightly wider posteriorly, with the beaks very 

 close to the anterior end, full and prominent, and so near together 

 that the beaks of the shell must be closelj' contiguous. Hinge-line, 

 as indicatetl by a narrow ridge in the cast, is gently arcuate from the 

 pMJsterior end nearly to the beaks. Ju.st below and anterior to the 

 beaks it bends rather deeply downwards and the teeth, as indicated 

 in the cast, are comparatively large. There seems to be about seven 

 of these enlarged teeth in the short, downwardly-curved anterior arc. 

 Immediately behind this arc there is a space where the teeth seem 

 to have been very small and irregular. The rest of the hinge seems 

 to have had moderately small, regular teeth, indicated by crenula- 

 tions in the cast. The lateral surfaces of the cast has low, irregular 

 concentric waves and numerous very shallow radial impressions. 

 The anterior border is distinctly creaiulated, but elsewhere the 

 internal borders of the valves would ap]iear to have b(>en smooth.

This peculiar ark differs widely from ail Tertiary species known to 

 U8. The double curve of the tooth-row, with ejilarged teeth on its 

 short anterior arc, is a more specialized structure than we have found 

 in the species conipared. The ri'cenl A. catniKchnisis Dillw. atmri-

anterior, contiguous beaks, the absence or weakness of crenulation 

 along the basal margin, and the concentric waves of the surface of 

 the cast. The shell when found will probably prove to be thin 

 for an Area. Its strong individuality will permit ready recognition 

 of this species, which we know from a single quite perfect cast.

 much flatter, the hinge more curved, and the internal margin has 

 strong V-shaped teeth.

The shell is slightly inequilateral, rather convex, the posterior end 

 more narrowly rounded and more produced than the anterior. 

 Sculpture of low but distinct radial ribs in the median part, obsolete 

 at the ends; over all are fine radial striae, about six strife (five to seven) 

 between crests of the ribs; these are crossed by regular but extremely 

 minute concentric striae, which pit the grooves between the radial 

 striae, when the surface is unworn. Hinge is little curved, with tooth-

Anomia ephippium Linn., Gabb. 



Very similar to the European A. cphippium. Externally the 

 convex value has a coarse sculpture of radial ribs, with radial 

 riblets and striie in the intervals. The byssal impressions are dis- 

 tinctly but not deeplj' impressed, but sufficiently to be readily seen 

 or felt. Major impression somewhat square; minor impression close 

 below it and not greatly smaller. Adductor inpression alongside

This species resembles the recent /'. Juscopurpurca Conrad in

 smaller. In our opinion it cannot be either P. oxygonum or I*. 

 Ihetidis of Sowerby. Whether it is specifically separable from 

 several forms found in the Canal Zone and Costa Rica is uncertain, 

 but there are various differences which indicate at least racial dis- 

 tinction. Typical specimens occur in some alumdance in the Howden

According to Guppy^ the lunule is entirely wanting in his species, 

 imt Dall, who has examined the types, states that it is large and 

 lanceolate, and there is "a close concentric sculpture of fine, sharp, 

 somewhat elevated lines" (Wagn. Trans. Ill, 1285). In the Santo 

 Domingo specimen (No. 2755), an excessively faint impressetl line 

 defines the lunule, which is about 7 mm. long, 3 wide. The sculp- 

 ture consists of unequal, unevenly developed flat growth-ripples, 

 which on the posterior dorsal slope become fine but not much elevated 

 threads.

A NEW HUMMINGBIRD FROM COLOMBIA. 

 BY WITMER STONE. • 



In a collection of birds from the Santa Mart a region of Colombia, 

 recently received by the Academy from Mr. M. A- Carriker, there 

 are two .specimens of a hummingbird which seem to belong to an 

 undescribed form. They are related to Lepidopyga cctruliigularis 

 Gould, but differ in having the whole under parts, except the under 

 tail coverts, glittering i)lue, while in that species the abdomen is 

 green, in sharp contra.st to the blue of the throat and breast. 



Of the two described species which are usually s>'nonymized with 

 L. ccpruliigularis, Trochilus Duchaissingii Bourcier {Compt. Rend., 

 XXXII, p. 187) from "bois entre la Gorgone et Panama," is un- 

 iloubtedly identical with that species. The other one, Thalicrania 

 L'cvlina Bourcier (Rev. ZooL, 18.3(3, p. 5.52), is described from the 

 ** environs de Santa Marthe," and one would suppose from the 

 loeality that it was likely to l)e the same form a.s that obtained by 

 Mr. Carriker. The description, however, seems to apply to a bird 

 much closer to Lepidopyga ccBruliigularis Gould, as it says: "Gorge, 

 <levant du cou, thorax d'un beau bleu l)rillant, verdi-ssant sur les 

 c6tds du cou. Abdomen vort bronze!?." 



In distinguishing it from Trochilus Duchaissingii [= L. ccendiigu- 

 luris], the de.scriber says: "elle en differc par le de.ssus de la tete et du 

 corps, terne bronz6 chez ce dernier, ainsi que par les formes des 

 rect rices et la coloration des mediaires, qui sont entidrcment cuivr^es." 



Brabourne and Chubb, in their "List of the Birds of South 

 America," recognize both L. cccruliigidaria ami L. cdlina, and if 

 they arr really distinct and if the type of L. cxxlina really came from 

 Santa Marta, it would .seem that it was the representative of L. 

 caruliigidaris in the coa.st region of the Santa Marta district. In 

 this ca.se the blue-bellied bird obtained i)y Mr. Carriker at Punto 

 <'aiman in the .same general region must l)e specifically distinct. 

 If, on the other hand, the type of L. avlina, shipped from Santa Marta, 

 was collected at some point more or les.s remote, in the mountains, 

 as is (juite possible since the exact locality at which many of these 

 old types were obtained wa.s not known, then both of them may be 

 bettfT regarded as races of L. cahdiiyularis. Whether the latter 

 15 




204 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



really occurs south of Panama is another question that remains to 

 be settled by the acquisition of additional material. 



Meanwhile it is desiralile to provide a name for the blue-bellied 

 bird, and until the distribution of the green-bellied forms is more 

 accurately worked out it had better be regarded as specifically 

 distinct. 



The description follows : 



Lepidopyga lillise sp. nov. 



Chars. Spec. — Similar to Lepidopyga ccendiigularis, but lower 

 breast and abdomen glittering blue instead of green and upper 

 surface darker green with much less bronze iridescence. 



Description. — Type, adult male, No. 62793, Collection Academy of 

 Natural Sciences of Philadelphia; Punto Caiman, Santa Marta, 

 Colombia, M. A. Carriker, Setpember 29, 1913. Above dark 

 glossy green with bronze tints showing only on the upper tail coverts 

 and median rectrices; general tone of upper parts bluish green as 

 contrasted with the yellow-bronze iridescence of L. cceruliigularis. 

 Below entirely glittering metallic blue excepting the under tail coverts 

 which are metallic green edged with dull white. The center of the 

 throat is purplish, as in L. cceruliigularis, and some of the posterior 

 feathers of the abdomen, especially the lateral ones, have green 

 reflections in certain lights. Feet black and bill black above and 

 flesh-colored with black tip below. 



Measurements.— Winfr, 48 mm.; tail, 35; culmen, 18; length in the 

 flesh, 105. Named in honor of Mrs. Witmer Stone. 



The .second specimen obtained by Mr. Carriker (No. 62794, Coll. 

 Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila.) is also an adult male and is exactly like the 

 type in coloration. It measures: Wing, 49 mm.; tail, 34; culmen, 19. 

 It was taken at the same time and place as the type.

MABINE MOLLUSKS OF HAWAII, I III. 

 BY HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



In the identification of mollusks obtained by the writer in 1913, 

 and those subjsequently received from Mr. D. Thaanum, of Hilo, 

 it was found necessar>' to review all the Hawaiian species of some 

 families. That the studies may be of use to others interested in the 

 Hawaiian fauna, it is proposed to publish the results in a series of 

 articles with illustrations of new forms and those not previously 

 figured. 



It is a pleasure to acknowledge the liberality of Mr. Samuel Hen- 

 shaw, Director of the Museum of Comparative Zoolog>', who allowed 

 the author to study and fipvire specimens from the Pease collection, 

 contained in that museum. Without these, definite conclusions 

 would be unattainable in many cases. 



I. THE PHASIANELLID^. 



The Hawaiian Phasianella; are all very small, but of exquisite 

 beauty. Probably all but P. thaanumi belong to the section Tri- 

 coliella Monts., type P. pulla, if this is separable from TricoUa. 

 For P. thaanumi a new .section, Hiloa, may be formed, characterized 

 as in the followinp: 



K(u t(t Hawaiian Phatiianell(F. 



a. Peristome projecting forward at junction of colunu'llar and liasal 

 margins; shell short, of rapidly enlarging whorls.

 Alciina rubra. It has not lieen reported from any ishind but Oahu. 

 It (Uffers from other Hawaiian species of tlie ^enus by its longer, 

 ovate contour. The patterns vary wid(l\ . An average specimen 

 measures:

 whorl opaque white; thin.

Kahoolawe, the type, No. 116188, from the north shore; another 

 specimen from Smuggler's Bay on the southern shore; collected by 

 Pilsbry. 1913. 



This is probably a di.^tinct species. It is thinner, with a thinner 

 columella than young P. variabilis of the same size. I did not find 

 variabilis on the island of Kahoolawe. 

 Phasianella bryani "• sp. Pi. XV, fig. 13. 



The shell is narrowly perforate, short and broad, rather solid, 

 smooth, nearly white, clo.^ely, obliquely lineolate with pale rose. 

 Spire short. Whorls well rounded, rapidly increa.sing. Aperture 

 oblique, nearly round. Columella rather thin, not prominent at 

 its junction with the basal margin.

Haleiwa, west coast of Oahu. Tyjx' and paratypes No. 116320, 

 A. N. S. P., collected by Pilsbry, 1913. 



This species occurred with P. variabilis, from which it is readily 

 separable In' the shorter spire and relatively i)roader last whorl. 

 The groove behind the columella is much narrower than in /-•. ttialo- 

 kaiensis, and the shell is thicker. Some examples have opaque white 

 spots below the suture. It is named for the author of Xatural 

 History of Hawaii, who was my comi)anion and guide on several 

 collecting trips to the reefs of Oahu. 

 Phaiianella molokaiansii n. Hp. PI. XV, fig. lu. 



The shell is thin, narrowly umbilicate, globosely ovate, smooth 

 and Klo.><sy, the type having old rose spots below the suture, irregular 

 .spots below the periphery, and a lineolate band i)etween, on a whitish 

 ground. The aperture is nearly round, oblitjue, showing the color 

 through; outer lip thin; columella thin, a deep and wide groove 

 b«'hind it.

The umbilicus and the groove below it are larger than in other 

 Hawaiian species. The shell is thinner than that of P. rariahili's or 

 P. hryani. 



The specimens vary in pattern, luit nearly all were bleached. 



Phasianella thaanumi " *p PI XV, figs. 12. n. 



Thf sliell is very thin, perforate, short, obliquely conic, the spire 

 short, somewhat attenuate, last whorl very rapidly enlarging. Surface 

 smooth, pale olive buff, translucent, with four indistinct, narrow 

 whitish bands on the latter part of the la.st whorl, where there are 

 also some very faint brownish flecks. 



The very large and decidedly oblique'aperture is subrotund, l)ut a 

 little longer than wide. The outer lip is well expanded. Columella 

 is narrowly expanded, thin, regularly arched, and there is a forwardly 

 salient angle where it joins the l>asal lij). The operculum is olive- 

 buff, strongly convex and smooth externally.

Hilo. Haw lii. I). Thaanum. Type and jiaratype No. 117053. 

 A. N. S. P., from No. H393 of Mr. Thaanum's collection. 



This species is very distinct by the projei'tion of the peristome at 

 the foot of the (-(jlumella. The rapidly enlarging whorls and marked 

 expansion of the lip are also characteristie. The surface has a thin 

 calcareous incrustation, unlike the clean, glossy appearance of most 

 Phasianellas. 



ALCYNA. 



Alcyna contains shells similar to PiKisianclla except that the 

 columella ha.s a strong tooth. The (»|)tr(uium is not yet known. 

 So far as we know, the gri-atest development of AIci/iki is on the 

 Hawaiian shores, where six species have l>een found. Pour of these 

 were described l)y \\ . 11. Pease, lSG0-'69. As none of them has

Pease's description was reproduced in Manual of Conchology. 

 He overlooked the fine, engraved spirals, of which there are six on 

 the penult whorl, more on the next earlier. On the last whorl they 

 are more or less weakened or even wanting in the peripheral region 

 and above, but distinct on the base. There is a vertical groove at 

 the axis, but not a perforation. As in other species, the columellar 

 tooth appears .stronger in an oblique view, l»ut the degree of emer- 

 gence varies individually. The whorl has a very low, broad swelling 

 V)eliind the lip in adults, l)ut it is often scarcely noticeable. 



The color, as seen in the ma.ss, is old rose, l)ut the shade varies 

 noticeably in different specimens. There is a white area around the 

 columella, and the apical whorl is slightly ])alcr. Otherwise the 

 color may be nearly uniform (fig. 2) or marked with darker oblique 

 lines on a paler ground on the spire, blotched with l)ufT or white 

 below the suture of the last whorl, with scattered whitish dots over 

 the rest of the surface (as in Reeve's fig. \Ha, and our fig.. 1), or 

 exceptionally there may be oblique red lines also on the last whorl. 

 The blunt lip-edge is touched with rose color in adult shells.

 encircled with narrow bands of old rose or jasper red, 7 to 12 on the 

 last whorl, the first two whorls whitish. Lip thickened, bevelled.

This charming little shell was found in Ijeach debris in both localities. 



It has about the shape of A. rubra, Init differs by lacking spiral 



imjiressed lines, the surface being smooth; also by the color-pattern, 



to which there is no approach whatever in the large series of A. rubra 



examined. It is colored like A. lineata, but that species is spirally 



ridged and .somewhat shorter.

Pea.se's description was rei)rinte(l in Manual of Voncholoijij, l)ut 

 the species has not been figured before. It is openly perforate, 

 about as figured for .4. sitbangulata, and, as Pease says, transversely

This species differs from .4. kapiolania , which is similarly colored, 

 by tln" well-developed spiral ridges, the ojx'n perforation and the 

 shorter contour. 



The type is figured. liesides this, I have seen a single sjx'cimen, 

 found at Waikiki, which appears referal)le to this species. It differs 

 by being a little more slender, with the columellar tooth more receding 

 and only part of the .spiral ridges are colored, there being live colore<l

Umbraculum sinicum aurantiacum (Pse.) which Mr. Thaanum 

 has taken at Hilo, appears to be sufficiently distinct from U. sinicu7n 

 by characters of the shell to merit a subspecific name.

The shell is oblong with acutely conic spire, solid, somewhat 

 shining, whitish, unevenly tessellated with flesh pink, the spotting, 

 interrupted by pale bands on the sixth and twelfth spaces between 

 spiral grooves; an apricot buff area at the base. Sculpture of 17 

 spiral grooves on the last, four on the penult whorl; they are closely 

 punctate; the upper two grooves and the lower seven are close, the 

 rest being nearly twice as far apart. Columellar fold heavy, its

Pease's set of this species, No. 31712, M. C. Z., consists of five 

 .somewhat beach worn specimens, all of them having lost the nuclear 

 whorls. There arc, I think, two species in the lot, both of which

 vexly conic. The nuclear whorl is more than half immersed. There 

 are 3 J subsequent whorls. The eolumellar is rather straight, with 

 a verv' small fold al)ove, and in an olilitjue view in the ajHTture 

 a low prominence may be seen near the base. The imier lip has a 

 rather heavy callus. Outer lip is strongly arched forward. :us usual.

The shell is narrowly umbilicate, oval, the diameter about two- 

 thirds of the length; widest slightly above the middle; thin, semi- 

 transparent, white, opaque white at base and vertex, marked with 

 narrow, irregularly waved (sometimes branching) tawny or cinnamon- 

 brown streaks. The surface is glossy, with sculpture of engraved 

 encircling grooves; the intervals being closely sculptured with 

 circular striae near the ends, but smooth towards the middle, where 

 the grooves are wider apart (and, except in the largest individuals, 

 there is a smooth zone in the middle, which narrows progressively 

 with age). The vert ex has a very small and shallow concavity about the 

 posterior axis. The axis posteriorly has a moderate, oblicjue fold. 

 The columella is narrow, nearly straight, but there is a small promi- 

 nence below the rniddle. The aperture is narrowly rounded anteriorly.

Bulla ferruginosa Gmelin {Syat. Sat. 13, p. 3432) is a young Cypnea, 



so that A. Adams' form requires if new name. It may be called Atys

 The rounded vertex is closely .striate spirally, not deeply sunken in 

 the center. Upper part sculptured with about 12 spiral impressed

This form agrees with the account and figures of A. debilis except 

 in shape; it is wider in the upper part, though not at the vertex. 

 As no specimen of A. debilis is in the Pease collection at Cambridge, 

 and comparison with the supposed type in London is impracticable 

 at this time, the present form is described subject to further inves- 

 tigation. 



The summit is more pinched up into a narrow ridge than in A. 

 fylindrica (Helbling.) or .4. parallela Gld. A. hycdina Watson is less 

 slender. 



The species reaches a size considerably greater than the specimen 

 serving as type. One from Hilo, sent by Mr. Thaanum (No. 117076) 

 measures, length 15, diam. 6.7 mm. There are about 11 spiral 

 grooves on the upper fourth, followed by 4 or 5 slightly elevated

III. THE MELANELLID^ (Eulimidce). 



The absence of sculpture and the rarity of color, together with 

 the simplicity of form, reduce the number of available specific charac- 

 ters in this family, rendering determination of species difficult. 

 The arrangement of varices, whether in one or two longitudinal 

 straight or spiral series, or sparsely scattered, is a valuable feature, 

 also the >\-idth of the gray border below the suture, and the curvature 

 of the outer lip; but these have often been overlooked in published 

 descriptions. The size of the apex is often useful, also the degree 

 of curvature, which, however, is individually rather variable. 



All of the known Hawaiian species are mentioned below, but there 

 are certainly many more. At least half a dozen species, beach 

 material, are represented in our collection by specimens somewhat 

 worn, or by single shells which may not be adult, though obviously 

 distinct. 



Melanella thaanumi n sp Pi. XIV, figs. 5 to 6 a. 



The shell is white, slightly transparent, rather solid, with strongly 

 developed curvature in two directions. Whorls very slightly convex, 

 each with one varix. The varices are opaque white, the series 

 ascending the spire spirally on the right side and back, making 

 between a fourth and a half turn. The aperture is ovate. Outer 

 lip arches very strongly forward. Length 25, diam. 7 mm.; length 

 of aperture 6 mm.; 13 whorls, the apical ones lost (type, figs. 5, 5a). 

 An immature specimen 19 mm. long has 16 whorls, the apex perfect.

None of the series before me is so much curved as Sowerby's figure, 

 yet the individuals vary considera])ly in curvature. 



There is an allied species from Mauritius (PI. XIV, figs. 2, 2a) 

 which differs from thnanumi by the somewhat larger size and wider 

 form. It differs from EuUma mnjor by the much more strongly arched 

 outer Up. Length 28.5, diain. 9, length oi jij)i'rture 8 mm.; 15 whorls,

 M. ticicula (Gld.) (Stylifer ocicula Gld.), of which specimens of the

more slender shell, with the sutural margin narrower, and the spire 

 less bent. 



Eulima venusta Pease, from the Paumotus, is very closely related 

 to aciculata, but perfect specimens have a larger apex; the outer lip, 

 also, is somewhat more arched forward. 



So far as I know, there is no reliable record of Eulima acicula 

 (Gld.) from the Hawaiian group. Tryon's record seems to have 

 pertained to Eulima aciculata Pease, of Sowerby, which he appears 

 to have thought was not the true aciculata of Pease, but was a 

 synomjTii of acicula. This opinion seems to me without adequate 

 foundation. Tryon has recorded two synomyms of E. acicula: 

 Eulima vitrea A. Ad. (Fiji) and Leiostraca pyraynidalis Sowb. (Hab. 

 unknown.) From the figures, these appear to be rightly placed. 



Mr. Thaanum's specimens of M. aciculata from Hilo, Hawaii 

 (No. 82228 and 108472 A. N. S.), differ from the Pease examples 

 by being a little more robust, with the early whorls slightly more 

 attenuate (fig. lie). 



Length 9, diam. 2.75, length of aperture 2.3 mm.; 16 whorls 

 (PI. XIV, fig. 8a). 



Length 8.8, diam. 2.75, length of aperture 2.5 mm. (PI. XIV, fig. 8). 



The aperture is narrowly ovate. Outer lip runs rather far forward and is 

 retracted again at the base. 



Length 10.9, diam. 3.1 mm.; length of aperture 3 mm.; 14 whorls. 



It resembles M. aciculata (Pse.), but the margin below the suture is narrower, 

 the last whorl is wider, and especially, the ape.x is larger.

Two specimens sent are figured. It is the narrower one which 

 agrees with Souverl)ie's description and figure. It measures, length 

 7.8, diam. 3.7 nun. The wider one measures, length 7. diam. 3.9 

 mm. With so small a numl)er, one can hardly tell whether the 

 difference is merely indivielual variation or of .specific significance. 

 Temporarily the wide variety may he called form latior (fig. 106).

 not from New Caledonia, as Tryon stated {Man. Conch. \TII,

The apical whorl> of this shell are like those of Stylifer, and unlike 

 Scale no.stoma. It may be taken as type of-a new .section distinguished 

 by the smooth attenuate early whorls, and to be called Hyperlia.

Pea.se was the first to determine the locality of this peculiar snail

 None of the shells seen have them in such regular festoons as are 

 shown in the Thv.satirns figure, which ai)parently served as the 

 original of Dr. liartch's enlarged view. The spire is just perceptibly 

 bent in the upper part, composed of slightly convex whorls. There 

 is series of curved, linear varix-lines on both right and left sides, the 

 lines recetling a little with ascent of the spire, ,so that in the ui)per 

 part they are dorsal and ventral. The later whorls are rather con- 

 spicuously compressed between dorsal and ventral sides, as shown 

 in the basal outline, fig. \'M>, and there is a flattened area un the face, 

 near the bane, banded liy an acute, ascending cvirved angulation on

 narrow, inner lip straight, and heavily calloused in the middle. 



Length 8.8, diam. 3 mm.; about 9 whorls. 



Siibularia has recently been restricted by Dr. Bartsch to the type 

 S. metcalfci A. Ad. Leiostraca distorta Pease forms a second species 

 of the group, no others being known to belong to it. 



Subulario differs from Melanella {Eulima) by its compressed shape 

 and by having a flattened area at the base of the ventral side, between 

 the colun\ella and a short angular longitudinal ridge on the left side; 

 the aperture is very narrow, more than. twice as long as wide, and the 

 inm^r lip is straight. 



Subularia is somewhat like Strombiformis (Leiostraca of most 

 authors) in its narrow mouth, but it is probably more closely related 

 to Melanella by the varices. The flattened area is an unique feature. 

 The genus Chileutomia Tate and Cossmann differs by its projecting 

 varices.® 



The two species known are very distinct by the following characters. 



Spire nearly straight, with varix-lines on the right and left sides 

 (Section Subularia); colored markings present. S. metcalfei. 



Spire strongly curved, with varix-lines on the right side only 

 (Section Hemiliostraca). Shell without color markings, S. distorta, 



A very minute specimen from Smuggler's Bay, Kahoolawe, a 

 larger one from the north coast of Molokai and several from the 

 beach near Waikiki, Oahu, seem to be Sul)ulariie, but as part are 

 single specimens and none in fresh condition they are mentioned here 

 merely as an indication that there are other species. Single shells 

 are particularly inconclusive in this family, as there is nothing to 

 definitely mark the adult stage.

between dorsal and ventral sides (fig. 13c). The ventral side is 



flattened near the base, the flattening bounded by a longitudinal 



angulation on tlit- left side. The internal axis is faintly visible

DERMAPTEROLOGICAL NOTES. 

 BY MORGAN HEBARD. 



In the many large exotic collections at hand, i)Ut very few specimens 

 of Dermaptera are to be found. In no csa^c are the forms of the 

 order sufficiently represented to give anything but a fragmentary 

 faunistic knowledge, excepting in the West Inilian, Mexican, Costa 

 Ricanand Panamanian .series, which are being reported on separately. 

 The study of these important .series hoA offered an opportunity to 

 determine the one hundred and four .specimens discussed lielow. In 

 several instances features of decided interest are encountered, the 

 types of several old .species are discu.s.sed, while among the thirty-one 

 species recorded, one new genus and six new species are found. 



Our hearty thanks are accorded to Dr. F. E. Lutz, of the American 

 Museum of Natural History, Dr. Sanmel HeiLshaw, of the Museum 

 of Comparative Zoology and Prof. Lawn'nce Bruner, of the Univer- 

 sity of Nebraska, not only for the loan of undetermined material, 

 l)ut of historic specim«Mis antl types as well, enabling us to work out a 

 number of vexing i)roblems. Mr. A. N. Caudell, of the I'liited 

 States National Museum, has also helped us greatly, but the rule of 

 his institution. i)reventing the loan of types, has obliged us to omit 

 the ((Misideration of certain species which bear on our work, the status 

 and relationship of wliich is not at present clearly understood.

 pnlchra as genotype of Spandex.- 



These .specimens show little variation except in pronotal coloration. 

 The pronotum varies from solid Sanford's brown, to almost solid

 condition. 



The lirazilian specimen differs from all others before us in having 

 the femora heavily and very broailly annulate with blackisii brown.

to he a member of the genus Spongiphora. The peculiar and dis- 

 tinctive character of the second tarsal joint in the present genus 

 clearly led Rehn to refer the species incorrectly to the Forficulidae, 

 but Burr's erection of a new genus for bogotensis is unwarranted 

 and wouUl not have occurred had comparisons been made. 



The species has the general facies, head, proximal antennal joint, 

 tegmina. wings, tarsal joints and general character of proximal 

 dorsal abdominal segments, pygidium and forceps as typical for 

 Spongiphora. In this genus,- the second tarsal joint is nearly as 

 long as the third and both are enlarged; the second is. however, 

 hardly broader than the third and, enlarging suddenly in the proximal 

 portion, does not form the heart-shaped lobe characteristic of the 

 Forficulidse. The roughness of the abdominal surface in bogotensis, 

 and particularly of the specialized ultimate dorsal segment, are 

 striking features of specific value. The tarsal joints are thickly 

 supplied with hairs ventrad, as in croceipennis, these hairs, however, 

 being coarser in the present species.

Burr's figure is excellent. Though the males of this species and 

 of M. bilineatus (Scudder) are extremely different, the females are 

 l)y no means easily separated. Those before us of basolis have the 

 jngidium with di.stO-lateral projections smaller and very slender, 

 the proximal dorso-internal brief shelf of the forceps as broad 

 l)roximad as distad, the metazona entirely translucent'" and the 

 longitudinal i)ale bands at the tegminal shoulders and proximo- 

 external pale areas of the exposed portion of the wings yellowish. 

 In females of hHiiieatus the disto-lateral i)roj('ctions of the pygidium 

 are acute-angulate, but scarcely project caudad of the distal margin, 

 the proximal dor.so-internal brief shelf of the forceps narrows proxi- 

 iim<l, the pronotum is only slightly paler narrowly laterad on the 

 metazona and the pah* markings of the tegmina and wings are i)ale 

 buffy.

Prolabia modesta (Bnmcr). 



1906. Labia moiUsta Bruncr, Jour. X. Y. Ent. Soc, XIV, p. 137.-' 

 [Trinidad.] 



The unique female type of thi.s .species is now l)efore us and is 

 found to represent a specitvs of the Unidentata Group of the genus 

 ProUibin. 



It shows very close relationship to the recently described Prolabia 

 dominiar Hebard, differing from females of that species in the 

 decidedly larger size, exposed portion of wings with a large proximo- 

 external yellowish buffy spot and ultimate dorsal abdominal segment 

 with a few minute rugae in the medio-distal depresseil area, before 

 the marginal row of minute ruga>. which row is broken mesad. The 

 males will probably show much more decided differences between 

 these species. 



The mea.•^urements of this type are: length of body 7.5, of pronotum 

 1.2, of tegmen 2.1, of exposed portion of wing 1.4, of forceps 2.2; 

 width of pronotum 1.15, greatest width of abdomen 1.8 mm. 



Both modesta and dominiar are ilistinctive in the females having 

 no large, blunt, dorsd-proxiinai i)r()j('cti()n on the iiit('rn:il face of 

 the forceps. 

 Prolabia asoeaiionis "' »v six-rics. Pl. XVI. Rk.h. 8. o. 



This small insect, which is shining reddi.-h l»rown with a pale spot 

 on the exi)osetl portion of each wing, is of the characteristic color 

 type of the Unidentata (Jroup of tlie genus Labia and of numerou-s 

 species of the SpoiigiphorincE. 



The male ]iygidium is (piadrate as in P. arachidis, but with distal 

 portion differently sculplureil and the forceps, though bidentate, 

 much as is normal in that species, are less flattened. The in-sect is 

 smaller and distinctly less rol)Ust than arackidis and does not have 

 the befoule<l, greasy appearance of that insect. 



Type: cf : Ascension Island, South Atlantic. [Museum of Com- 

 parative Zoology.] 



Size rather small; form moth'rately rol>ust, l)Ut not nearly as robust 

 as arachiilis. Head much as in that species, sutures subobsolete.

 The pygidium is declivent proximad, the ventral portion produced, 

 quadrate, with distal margin truncate, but showing three small, 

 triangular productions. The forceps have a decided lamellate 

 proiluction of the internal margin which ceases abruptly at the base 

 of the strongly incurved apices, this margin armed with a blunt

ThLs genu.s agrees with Osteulcus alone, of the genera of the present 

 subfamily, in the male penultimate ventral abdominal segment 

 lacking projecting processes, but differs from that genus in the form 

 of this segment, the tegmina which are not keeled beyond the shoul- 

 tlers and in having the seventh dorsal alxlominal segment alone 

 specialized laterad, not considering the stink glands,-^ The abtlomen, 

 with greatest width mesad, gives a superficial resemblance to Mixo- 

 co.smia. The evenly and not strongly arcuate forceps suggest the 

 type found in .some species of Paracosmia, but are more simple.

NOTES ON MEXICAN MELANOPLI. 

 (Orthoptera; Acrididae.) 



BY MORGAN HEBARD, 



In preparing a Revision of the Melanopli of North America, north 

 of Mexico, it has been found necessary to consider all of the Mexican 

 material at hand. We have before us the greater portion of the 

 important material, including almost all the types, described by 

 Scudder in his Revision of the Orthopteran Group Melanopli and 

 by Bruner in the Biologia Centrali-Americana; the papers here 

 referred to being the most important single contributions to the 

 knowledge of this group for Mexico. The Philadelphia collections 

 contain other types and important series previously recorded from 

 Mexico. In addition, we have fortunately been able to a.ssemble 

 nearly all the recently collected Mexican Melanopli and take the 

 pre-sent opportunity to record the same. 



It is clear that great numbers of species of the Melanopli, found in 

 the southern portions of the United States, will be found in northern 

 Mexico, but as yet have not been taken in that country. In fact, the 

 Melanopli a.s.sembled show that generally ca-sual collecting has been 

 done, a very few localities fairly well investigated, while vast areas 

 still remain virtually unknown for this group. The last condition 

 is particularly true for all the regions of Mexico adjacent to the 

 United States. We woulil hesitate to report on collections so evi- 

 dently incomplete were it not necessary to point out the coiLsiderable 

 synonymy proven by the series at hand. 



Five genera and ten species are shown to be .synonymic in the 

 present paper. A single new species is described. Four hundred 

 and thirty-nine specimens, representing fourteen genera and thirty- 

 six species, an' here considered. 



The superficial character of Scudder's Revision is best shown by 

 the array of errors in his treatment of the species of the United States. 

 The errors applicable to Mexican material, for which he erected two 

 generic and six specific synonyms, did not come as a surprise after 

 the other portions of his work had been studied.*

Careful .stuily of the literature and .study of the specinieiLs di.s- 

 cussed below, proves to our full satisfaction the above synonymy. 

 Saussure's description. thou{z;h very l)rief, givi-s nearly. all the features 

 of importance. The efforts of Scudder and Bruner to locate Pedies 

 inrescens, the genotype by monotypy, have been decitledly incorrect, 

 their supposition being that the position of the species \va.s near 

 Dadxjlolum. At the time PanidichropluS' was described Brunner 

 ignored the genus Pedies. 



We would note that, from material before us, three species, mexi- 

 canus (Brunner), variabilis (Bruner) and atuicaiius (Caudell), in 

 addition to the genotype, are referable to Pedies; but that nigrigena 

 Rehn and hnonieri, fusiformi.s and bipunclalxis all of Giglio-Tos, 

 a.s.signed originally to Paradichroplus, can not pro]M'rly be placed in 

 the present genus. 



Striking features in the genus Pedies, as given by Sau.ssure, are: 

 the strongly (h'clivent and convex face; the sub-bicarinate frontal 

 costa; the conoid-arcuat<' apex of the heatl; the pronotum with strong 

 percurrent median carina cut weakly by the i)rincij)al transverse 

 sulcus, with distinct percurrent lateral carinie and with caudal margin 

 distinctly emarginate, and male genitalia of the characteristic tyjx; 

 found in iJirhruplus and allied genera.*

This insect, the single type of which is before us, is a distinctly 

 aberrant member of the present genus. Compared with P. 7nexicanus 

 it is found to differ in the slender, conical prosternal spine, the 

 weakly obtuse-angulate caudal margin of the pronotum, the dis- 

 tinctly less retreating face, lanceolate and overlapping tegmina and 

 distinctive male genitalia. The general structure, however, par- 

 ticularly of the head and pronotum, shows definitely a derivation 

 from the stock of P. virescens and mexicanus rather than from any of 

 the types of the genus Melanoplns.^

Careful comparison of iScudder's type of parvidua antl his type and 

 allotype of geniculatus with StkVs description of pilosus proves the 

 synonymy given above, StM's material apjiarently differing only in 

 being somewhat larger, (length IG mm.). That size variation occurs 

 in the species is shown by the two males before us, (length 12.7 and 

 14 mm.).

The genotype of Pha'drotettix, angustipennin, is inseparaVUe generi- 

 cally from the species of Rhabdotettix, of which palmeri is the genotype. 

 It Is true that palmeri antl dumicola^ agree closely in distinctive 

 features of male genitalic development, while in both the tegmina 

 are ovate. In the other species of Phcedrotettix the tegmina are 

 linear, but this difference alone is utterly insufficient to warrant 

 generic separation. The male genitalic development shows widely 

 different features in a number of the species, this being much the 

 greatest in vcdgiis, but in our opinion generic separation is in no case 

 warranted. 



A careful comparison of the genotype, Phcedrotettix angustipennis, 

 with accola, genotype of Cijclocercua, shows also that the latter genus 

 must fall in the present synonymy. The pronotum of aecola shows 

 a very slightly heavier median carina than is found in the other 

 species of Phrdrotettlx. This feature is of no generic value, nor are 

 the male genitalic features given by Scudder. In fact, were the 

 latter given generic significance it would be necessary to separate 

 gracilis and bistriguta as one, litim a.s another, palmeri and dumicola 

 as another and vnlgn as still another genus.

The type and allotype, belonging to the Museum of Comi)arative

 pattern and /-*. accola in pronotal form- and contour, but has the 

 tegmina of the broader type found in P. Utus, palmeri and diimicoUi. 

 The elongate, slender, parallel male furcula, with a node on the 

 ilorsal surface of the subgenital plate on each side of these appendages 

 are distinctive features in the jiresent genus.

 features of coloration. Dorsal surface of head ami pronotum rather 

 pale. i)ost ocular dark stripe broad, less distinct but percurrent on 

 the lateral lobes of the pronotum and continued on the tegmina,

The type and an additional topotypic male, when comi)ared with

 The t'Xtraordinary mal«' genitalia are very similar in the two species, 

 the only noteworthy diffi'iem-e being in the greater distal width of 

 the cerci in the genotype, behrrnsii. 



When coMJpared, we find the male of nitida to l>e more rol)Ust in 

 structure, with pmujitum shorter, j)rozona more convex, with tran.s-

 is weakly convex in longitudinal outline anfl prozona laterad weakly

It is further evident that Scudder's Barytettix peninsulce,^^ known 

 from the unique female l)efore us, is nearer Sinaloa than any other 

 described genus and should he placed in this genus until the male 

 sex is found to determine whether separation is necessary. 



The female type of peninsidcF is more robust, with pronotum 

 l>roporti()nately much shorter, than the female allotype of bchrensii. 

 It differs further in the broader and non-sulcate facial costa, decided 

 transverse sulci of the dorsum of the pronotum which cut the weak 

 median carina,'^ strikingly bicolored tegmina and marking of the 

 lateral lobes of the pronotum, which is of the same general type as 

 found in nitida but Ijy no means as solidly, sharply and strikingly 

 defined as in that species.

 from the ea.stern portion of the arid .southwestern Uniteil States.

jiupposeclly adult and, in eoiLsequence, very dLstinctivo insect. 

 Bruner's sjiionymic genus and three synonymic specific names are 

 entirely attributable to Scudder's error and the remarkai)le color 

 variation found in the species. 



The males are either brilliant green, marked with buff, or brown 

 with a greenish suffusion, marked with buff; the females are either 

 solid and almost immaculate brown or green, marked with buff. 

 The caudal tibise and tarsi of the males are entirely jasper red to 

 scarlet red, or this color only in the distal third or two-fifths of the 

 tibiiE, the remaining proximal portion being light terre verte or 

 porcelain blue. The females have the caudal tibia? and tarsi usually 

 much less brilliantly colored, entirely reddish, or bluish, changing 

 gradually through purplish to redilish distad. The dorso-lateral 

 pale lines of the pronotum are striking only in the green condition of 

 both .sexes, these vary in width and are sometimes abruptly terminated 

 at the principal sulcus. None of the.se types of coloration have any 

 further significance than the adaptation of the individual to local 

 environmental condit ions.

 Nearest approach to the pre.«;ent insect is shown by C. lamprotata 

 Rehn antl Hel)ar(l. Comparetl with that iiLsect, similis is found to be 

 more robust, with coloration deeper and less brilliant. The males 

 of Campiilacdnihn, like those of HcsperoU'ilix, differ from the majority 

 of the species of the Melanopli in having the genitalia very much 

 alike in all of the species belonging to the genus. 



The male from Monclova has the tegmina reaching the apex of 

 the su|)ra-anal plate; in the Lerilo males the tegmina are shorter, 

 about half as long as the abdomen.

This insect is the optimum development of the forms of tiie \'iridis 

 Ciroup. The intensified coloration, particularly of the black 

 markings, combined with its heavier build, gives the species a dis- 

 tinctive facies when compared with its nearest ally, //. viridis. 



The male from Durango is less brilliantly colored and much smaller 

 than the type, now l)efore us. 



The female specimen nf //. pnitcnsis labelled "Orizaba, Mexico"

This specimen agrees fully in all diagnostic features with the type 

 and paratype before us. It is slightly smaller than the female 

 allotype and the coloration is less intense, the marginal fields of the 

 short almost circular tegmina being feebly darkened and only in 

 their proximal portion, the ventral surface of the caudal femora 

 showing very faintly an orange tinge and the caudal tibia) being a 

 much less intense glaucous. 



The broad jirosternal spine, with cephalic face weakly concave and 

 distal margin broadly convex-truncate, is a striking feature in the 

 present insect. Though different in this respect and in male genitalic 

 features as well from M. rejlexus, affinity to that species is clearly 

 indicated in the head, pronotum, form of tegmina and general type 

 of coloration. 

 Melanoplus desultorias insignis new subspecies. 



This handsome insect is clearly the optimum development of the 

 species desultorius Rehn, showing sufficient differentiation to warrant 

 its recognition as a geographic race. From typical desultorius the 

 present insect differs in the larger size, richer greens of the body and 

 red of the antenna^, more uniform coloration of the external faces of 

 the caudal femora and particularly in the more ample, conspicuously

 Sonora, Mexico.) 



The synonymy of marculentus is clearly proven by comparison of 

 the different large series before us with the single type of lakinus^^ 

 and of marculentus.^ An optimum condition, very robust in struc- 

 ture, is the l)asis for this name; the mesosternal differences noted by 

 Scudder are wholly due to slight individual variation. 



The typical series of .sonorcB is lost; the material clearly npicsi-nting 

 dried alcoholic .speciniens of lakinus, in which the caudal tibiie have 

 lest their glaucous coloration, becoming yellowish brown.-' Material 

 similarly badly preserved is before us.

CONCERNING RAFINESQUES PRECIS DES DECOUVERTES SOMIOLOGIQUES. 

 BY DAVID STARR JORDAN. 



In Palermo, in 1814, Constantine Samuel Rafinesque published a 

 mean little pamphlet which he called "Precis des D^couvertes 

 Somiologiques, ou Zoologiques et Botaniques." By his newly 

 invented word "Somiology" Rafinesque meant Systematic Zoology 

 and Botany. In another paper of the same date he gives the " Princi- 

 paux Fondamentaux de Somiologie, ou les Lois de la Nomenclature 

 et de la Classification de I'Empire Organique ou des Animaux et des 

 V^getaux." 



These laws of nomenclature are mostly reasonable enough, except 

 that they justify the substitution of new names on trivial grounds, 

 A name may be too long or too short, and all names indicating 

 likeness to other genera, as Gobioides, Scoynberomorus, Scomberesox, 

 were discarded. These rules he applies at once to numerous plant 

 genera and in his "Analyse de la Nature," in 1815, to many others 

 also. 



The "Precis de Ddcouvcrtes" has i^een rarely seen by naturalists. 

 The only copy I have examined is in the library of the Department 

 of .\gricultur('. In it the following species are described, from Sicily, 

 unless (jtlnTwise noted:

 ti la faniille des Gadiens. T. fasciatus: Jaune dor6 rayd transversa- 

 lenient de brun: ligne laterale droite et brune: queue f()urch(?e." 



According to Risso this is the same as his Muntd aipelanus or 

 limchijgaduH minulus (L). This identification is prol)ul)ly correct, 

 in which ca.se Trisoptcru-s replaces Jirnchyyadiis (lill.

Upper side reddish, dotted with brown; lateral line arched in front;

Bothas diaphanas, p. 17. 



Hyaline, a red spot on opercle; two at ba.se of caudal; 12 along 

 body near dorsal and anal; dorsal beginning over mouth; lateral 

 line straight. 



These three species are plainly larval flounders, the first possibly 

 Flesus flesus (L) the others perhaps Butluis rhombus (L). 

 Monoohirus hispidus, p. 17. New genus. 



This is a valid genus and species for which Rafinesque's name 

 must stand. 

 Blennius lanceolatus, p. 17. 



Body lanceolate; tail sharp; silvery, dotted with brown; back 

 greenish; ventral rays 3; a i^arbel under the mouth. (Not identified, 

 possibly Ophidion barbalum L.) 



Fhycis agrammus. p. 17.

Esoz reticulatus, p. IS. 



Coriys coinprime, sans lijiiie laterale, reticule de noir bleuatre sur 

 un fond argente, bouche grande noire, a dents erochues inegales; 

 nageoires blanchdtres, les dorsale et anale a 16 rayons, queue fourchue. 



This seenLs to be the common European pike, Esox Indus L. 

 The name invalidates the later name of Esox reticulatus, given in 

 1818 by Le Sueur to the Grass Pike or Green Pickerel of Eastern 

 States of America. For this, the name Esox tredecemlineatus given 

 by Professor Mitchill in 1852, to his "Federation Pike" from Oneida 

 Lake, should apparently stand. ]Mit chill was impressed with the 

 patriotic agreement of this fish, having 13 dorsal rays, 13 anal rays 

 and 13 branchiostegals, with the thirteen American States. 



Esox phaleratus Say, 1818, from East Florida, was never described. 

 The few words quoted from Say by Le Sueur, apply better to the 

 little banded pickerel, Esox americanus Gmelin. "Body dusky 

 with a vertical fulvous vitta and three or four fulvous fasciae. '' 



Balistes fuscatus, p- 10. 



Brownish, with 3 large black spots. Dorsal spines 3, the first 

 very rough. Pectorals with 15 rays, the first very rough. Between 

 the Azores and the United States. This seems to be Balistes forci- 

 patus Gmelin. 

 Chironectes variegatus, p- 19. 



Compressed; gray olive above with large spots and streaks of 

 black and small white spots; two appendages above eyes. Between 

 the Azores and the United States. This is apparently Histrio 

 iumidus (Osbeck). Chironectes variegatus of Cuv. ct \'al. is a different 

 species. 



The three following are from streams flowing into Chesapeake Bay: 



Centropomus albus, p. 19. D. VIII, 10. A. 12. 



Tail half forked; upper jaw the longer. This seems to be Morone 

 nmcricnnn (Imelin, but the number of dorsal rays should be IX-1, 12. 

 Centropomui lateas, p- 19- 



Yellow with brown bands; lower fins red; jaws almost equal; tail 

 almost entire; second dorsal unspotted. This is Pcrca flnvcsccns

1917.1 NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 270 



ON A FORGOTTEN GENUS OF SHARKS DESCRIBED BY NARDO. 

 DAVID STARR JORDAN. 



In a paper entitled " Observazione Ittiologiche" in the Afinali 

 delle Scienze del Regno Lomhardo-Veneli, 1843, Professor Gian 

 Domenico Nardo, described a genus of sharks, to which I have seen 

 no subsequent allusion. He calls the genus Caninoa or Caninotus 

 in honor of Charles Lucien Bonaparte, prince of Canino. 



The type is Sgualus barbarus Xardo or Caninoa ciereghini Xardo. 

 This shark is said to have but one dorsal fin, inserted behind the 

 ventrals, the gills 5 as in ordinary sharks; no spiracles; the teeth 

 equal, triangular, elongate, very sharp, dentate at the ba.se. The 

 tail is not described. 



This agrees with no known shark. It is barely possible that it is 

 based on an individual of Carcharhinus commersoni which had its 

 first dorsal fin bitten off while very young. The Hexanchida, sharks 

 with one dorsal fin, have spiracles, and teeth of a different type. A 

 deep water shark, Pentanchns Smith & Radcliffe, lately described 

 from the Philippines, has but one dorsal and five gill openings. 

 The small tlorsal is, however, inserted over the very long anal and 

 the tricuspid teeth could hardly i)e described as merely dentate at

NEW AND LITTLE KNOWN GASTROPODA FROM THE UPPER CRETACEOUS 



OF TENNESSEE. 



BY BRUCE WADE. 



An announcement of the discovery of unii.sually well pre.-^erved 

 Ujiper Cretaceous fo.<sils in the Ripley formation on Coon Ci'eek in 

 McXair>' County, Tennessee, wa.s made in the Contributions to 

 Geology of the March, 1917, number of the Johns Hopkins Uniiersity 

 Circular. A somewhat detailed description of the locality and a few 

 preliminary observations on tlie fauna were made in the same article. 

 The studies of this fauna have since been pursued further and mor(> 

 than 350 species have been recognized. 



The Gastropoda of this fauna are especially interesting, since this 

 class is so prolific and .so well preserved. A systematic study of these 

 gastropods has recently been submitted as a dis.sertation from the 

 Geological Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins University. In this 

 study 151 species of Gastropoda from the Coon Creek locality have 

 been differentiated and descril)ed. As a result of the evidence 

 furnished by this large assemblage of perfect or nearly perfect univalve 

 shells, it has been found necessary, in order to classify all of these 

 forms, to propose several new generic groups. Descriptions of some 

 of the more interesting of these new genera and species have been 

 published recently- and it is the purpo.se of the present paper to 

 present several additional forms of especial interest from this 

 locality.'

 been referred to the genus Conorbis since it shows all the generic 

 features revealed in the type of the genus, Cojius dorniitor (Sowerby)^ 

 from the Eocene of western Europe. The Tennesisee form is probably 

 the first typical Conorbis to be reported from the Upper Cretaceous.

This genus is proposed for a group of ^'olutes represented by two 

 species from Coon Creek and a third species from (Iwl Creek which 

 jire characterized by large, inornate shells with expanded bodies and 

 low sjMres. This group is probably nearer Liopeplum^ than any 

 other described genus but differs from that genus very essentially in 

 the character of the spire, the outline of the body, and further in the 

 obliqueness and number of the columellar plaits. Another closely 

 related group of Volutes in the Upper Cretaceous is represented by 

 the species Melo pyriformis Forl^es from the Arrialoor, South India,^ 

 a species which Cossmann has referred to the genus Scaphella.^

 ill his text to the species nor has mention of it been found elsewhere 

 in his writings. This figure does not show all the shell features but 

 it presents characteristics that seem sufficient to say that Conrad's 

 form is a species of the new genus Hyllus. 



The species, Hyllus callilateris, is the type of the genus and is 

 represented in the present collection by one specimen which is well 

 preserved excejit for the loss of the apex. The species is well charac- 

 terized by the Ijroad flat l)ody with a heavy calliis deposit on the 

 ])ody opposite the inner lip and further by the single columellar 

 plait. 



Hyllus coloratus n. sp. PI. XVII, figs. 3. 4. 



Description. — Shell of medium size and ovoid in outline; length 

 of aperture and anterior canal greater than the elevation of the spire; 

 whorls of conch proba])ly four in numlxT and increasing in size with 

 a fair degree of rapiiUty; sculpture absent, external surface smooth 

 and free from ornamentation except for incremental lines which show 

 tlintugh a brilliant glaze; suture indistinct, hidden by a glaze<l callus 

 which coats the entire surface of the shell; body evenly rounded 

 posteriorly and medially but gently constricted anteriorly into a 

 short broad i)illar which is mark<'d by a gently elevated ant(^rior 

 fasciole formed \)y increments of the anterior siphonal notch; aperture 

 lenticular, produced anteriorly into a short canal; posterior siphonal 

 notch shallow and subangular, directly in front of posterior commis- 

 sure, notch indicated behind margin of ajx-rture by incremental 

 lines; outer lip simple and smooth; inner lip excavated; columella 

 marked by two strong oblicjue folds; parietal wall thinly washed with 

 callus. 



Dimensions (imperfect individual).— Altitude 5.2 mm.; ma.ximum 

 diameter 2.4 mm. 



There are two specimens of this species juul both arc incomplete. 

 One of the.se shows a dark yellow color banding which is fixed in the 

 glaze of the ext<Tnal surface and is no <loubt a remnant of an original 

 color pattern. The species is w«'ll characterized by the two colu- 

 mellar folds which are conspicuous <»n the inner lip, the inornate 

 external surface an<l further by the subelliptical outline t»f the shell. 

 This sprcies differs from llyllus calliUiUris by being nmch smaller 

 ami having two columellar plait.-* iiLsteud of one and further by not 

 having a heavy deposit of callus on the body opposite the inner lip.

Genus FALSIFUSUS (;rabau.» 

 Falsifnsas mesozoicus n. sp. PI. XVII, figs. 11, 12. 



Description. — Shell small and fragile, fusiform in outline, spire 

 elevated and acute, pillar very long, slender and straight; elevation 

 of spire much less than length of aperture and canal; angle of spire 

 increasing with age; whorls closely ai:)pressed, five in number, whorls 

 of spire sharply convex or subangular in cross-section, body inflated; 

 protoconch small, smooth and trochoid, coiled thrice; sculpture of body 

 axial and spiral; axials strong, about ten in number on the body; 

 axial ribs angular and spinose on the keel of the shoulder of the body 

 but well rounded or nodulated on the whorls of the spire; axials 

 absent on the shoulder and obsolete on the base of the body; spiral 

 .sculpture elaborate and may be described in groups as follows: 

 a half-dozen subequal lirae on the shoulder, three on the sides of the 

 whorls of the spire, including the spiral which outlines the periphery'; 

 twice as many on the medial portion of the body with intercalated 

 secondaries; four or five irregular and obscure spirals on the posterior 

 portion of the base, four stronger equal and equispaced lirje upon the 

 anterior portion of the base; about a dozen increasingly finer spirals 

 upon the pillar; suture impressed and undulated by the costae of the 

 preceding whorl; Vjody abruptly constricted anteriorly into a long, 

 slender pillar; aperture narrow, ovate, produced in front into a long, 

 narrow canal with proximate, parallel margins; outer lip thin and 

 simple; inner lip excavated at the base of the body; columella smooth, 

 slightly twisted at the entrance of the anterior canal; parietal wall 

 thinly glazed. 



Dimensions. — Altitude 20.4 mm.; maximum diameter 8.2 mm. 



The slender and fragile shells of this species are well characterized 

 by the spinose terminations of the axials along the shoulder angle 

 of the body, the elaborate spiral sculpture and the slightly l)ent 

 slender pillar. The Miestrichtian species Fusus bicinctK.^ Kaun- 

 howen'* from Belgium is probably a related species of this genus. 

 Kaunhowen's species hits a higher spire and a much longer pillar than 

 the Tenne.s.see species and resembles the type of the genus more 

 closely. These two species are the first Upper Cretaceous f(jrms 

 to be referred to Grabau's genus Falsifuaus.

Genus BOLTENELLA n. gen. 



Etymology: Name given in honor of Bolten wlio applied the name 

 Busycon to the type genus of this famih'. 



Type: Boltenella excellans n. sp. 



Shell of nie<li(nn size, thin, fuiguroitl in outline; elevation of spire 

 less than the length of the aperture and anterior canal; whorls 

 closely appressed and increasing rapidly in size; protoconch smooth 

 and paucispiral, fairly large and bullous but not greatly inflated; 

 sculpture subdued, both axial and spiral elements present; aperture 

 pyriform; outer lip simple; parietal wall wa.shed with callus; columella 

 reinforced near the entrance of the anterior canal; pillar slender, 

 either straight or curved. 



This new genus is proposed to include a group of forms known 

 from two species, one from Coon Creek, represented by several well 

 preserved individuals antl another from the Upper Cretaceous of 

 Vaals, Germany, well illustrated and described by Holzapfel. The 

 German species, Hetnifii.sn.s coronatus (Roemer) Holzapfel'-' has 

 been variously a.ssigned by ilifferent authors since the days of Roemer 

 to such genera as Pyntla, Fusus, Rapa, Tritoniden, Tudicla, and 

 lastly to Ilemifusu.s by Holzapfel. The discovery of a related species 

 in the Ripley formation of Tennessee is further evidence of the 

 existence of a well defined group, characterized l)y a fulguroid outline, 

 a large, pauci.spiral i)rotoconch and further by the subdued spiral 

 and axial ornamentation of the outer surface, as well as a slender 

 pillar in front of an inflated body. The fulguroid outline and fairly 

 larg(! protoconch .seem sufficient to tie the group to the family 

 Basyconida*, yet there are many features that suggest the Fusiihe. 

 The genus Boltenella is probably intermediate between these two 

 families but more nearly like the Busyconidu; yet not near enough 

 to true Busycon to be inchuh'd in the group Protobusycon^* since it is 

 a nuich smaller form with a difTen'ul type of pillar and external 

 ornamentation. Among the Fusitla; it resembles Falsi fusun Gra\)iiU,^^ 

 but that group is typically more slender. Its .spire is elevated and 

 acuminate and the pillar is very long and straight. It is not typically 

 fulguroid in outline as is the group for which the name lioltenella is 

 proposed.

Boltenella exoellans n sp. PI. XVIII. figs. 3, 4. 



Description. — Shell of medium size and thin; elevation of the spire 

 less than the length of the aperture; whorls closely appressed and 

 strongly shouldered by a broad concave shelf, whorls five in number, 

 increasing in size from a minute apical whorl to a much inflated body ; 

 protoconch fairly large and bulbous: smooth and naticoid, coiled 

 two and a half tunes; sculpture well defined but somewhat subdued; 

 axials elevated and low% well rounded and short, persisting on the 

 whorls of the spire to the anterior suture but evanescing a little in 

 front of the shoulder angle of the body, axial ribs nodulated on the 

 body, nodes occurring directly upon the shoulder angle while the 

 axials persist for a short distance across the shoulder; spiral sculpture 

 low and fine, slightly irregular with secondary spirals developed in the 

 interspiral depressions near the aperture; spirals microscopically 

 roughened by the intersection of numerous incremental lines; suture 

 appressed and undulated by the axial ril)s of the preceding whorl; 

 body much inflated, shouldered behind, rounded or globose in front, 

 and merging into a long straight pillar which may be straight or 

 curved; aperture broadly ovate, grooved at the posterior commissure 

 and produced in front into a narrow canal ; outer lip thin and simple ; 

 inner lip excavated at the l)ase of the body; columella smooth, 

 reinforced at the entrance of the anterior canal by a deposit of callus; 

 parietal wall thinly glazed, outer margin of the wash sharply defined. 



Dimensions. — Altitude 38. i mm.; elevation of spire 13.5 mm.; 

 maximum diameter 18.7 mm. 



This species is represented in the Coon Creek collection by several 

 well preserved specimens, a few of which show the protoconch. 

 The species Is characterized by fulguroid shells which are ornamented 

 on the external surface both by axial and spiral sculpture. They 

 have a i)road, slightly concave shoulder and the angle of the shoulder 

 is nodulated on the body by the axial elevations.

narrow peripheral region, abruptly coustrieted in front of the periph- 

 ery; sculpture spiral, spinose and laminated in the type species; 

 incrementals sinuous in character, forming a reentrant angle along 

 the posterior keel; aperture subovate, produced in front into a narrow 

 canal; outer lip sinuous at the shoulder angle; inner lip reflected. 

 not always adnate to the body and pillar, a chink occasionally present 

 between the inner lip and pillar; pillar slender and elongate often 

 curved or bent near the anterior extremity. 



This genus has an acute spire and is characterized by a highly 

 inflated body with a narrow perijiheral region abruptly constricted 

 in front of this periphery. The pillar is long and variable. The 

 sculpture is dominant ly spiral with laminar, somewhat zig-zag 

 incremental lines. This genus is proposed to include two known 

 species, one from Coon Creek and another from both Ripley antl 

 Dumas, Mississippi, both of which are represented by several well 

 preserved specimens that present generic features that cannot be 

 included within the limits of any of the described groujjs. The 

 general form of the gf^nus suggests Hercorhynchus^^ or possibly 

 Pyrifu.sus. However, the strong sinuations of the axials along the 

 shoulder is a character by which it may be readily separated from 

 any of the previously known Busyconi(la\ There is a tendency 

 toward low, obtuse spires in most of the genera of this family, yet 

 some forms, such as Pyrifusu.^, are acute at the apex. With age, 

 however, this low angle of tlu' spire greatly increases, a feature very 

 characteristic of Sc()bitui. The stronglj' inflated, bicarinate body of 

 the South Indian Upper Cretaceous form Jiapn canrcUnta (ex j>arte) 

 Stoliczka''^ resembles Scobirui somewhat l)ut the South Indian form 

 is umbilicate, ami not acute spirally. Hapn has a well defined um- 

 bilicus. Pyropsis differs from Scobitid in having a low sj)ire and no 

 laminar incremental ornamentation. These characters will also 

 serve to separate Scnbinn from Trochifusua.^*

 with laminar spinose axial lines. It is common at Coon Creek and 

 represented in the jm-sent collection l)y a number of individuals 

 which show a wide variation in form and size. Further collecting

 two individuals are known. They were collected from Coon Creek 

 antl are the first representatives of thi.s genus to be reported from

 or tleeply impressed; body well rounded medially, constricted and 

 folded inward at the base of the body where a deep sulcus, parallel 

 to the spiral sculpture, separates the body from the pillar; aperture 

 broad and subovate, produced anteriorly into a short, recurved canal; 

 outer lip simple or varicose, a strong tooth-like projection occurring 

 on the margin at the anterior extremity of the spiral sulcus at the 

 base of the body; inner lip excavated medially; columella reinforced, 

 marked l>y an oblique plication near the anterior extremity and 

 along the margin of the anterior canal; parietal wall calloused, 

 sometimes heavily; pillar broad and short, slightly recurved; um- 

 bilical chink shallow; anterior fasciole broad, oblique, heavily 

 corrugated. 



This genus is well characterized by globose shells of ditYerent 

 sizes, having both spiral and axial sculpture variously developed. 

 The pillar is broad and short, being separated from the body by a 

 deep spiral sulcus that terminates with a tooth-like ]>rojection on the 

 margin of the outer lip, a shell character which possibly indicates the 

 former position of the eye-stalk of the animal. The genus is proposed 

 to include five species heretof«)re unknown in the literature: two from 

 Coon Creek, one from Owl Creek, and two from the Ripley of Texas; 

 and one species from Pataula Creek, Ceorgia, describeil by (labb 

 under the name of \asnu glohonnP There is no figure of this species, 

 but the tyiM', which is imperfect, may be seen at the Museum of The 

 Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. Tlir nmeric deter-

mination of Gabl)'s species was questioned In' Johnson^ in 1905. 

 The evidences furnished by recently (Uscovered material from Coon 

 Creek shows that these related species from the Ripley do not belong 

 to the genus Xnssa but represent a large, undescribed group of 

 magnificent forms which ijelong to the family Buccinidie. This 

 group is no doubt near Meek's genus Odontobasis.-* Seminola differs 

 from Odontobasis in liaving a globose or ovoid form rather than a 

 fusiform outline. Another closely related genus of the Buccinidie 

 is Pseudoliva^ Swainson, represented in the Senonian by Pseudoliva 

 zilUli Petho-*^ from Hungary. The sjiiral groove in Pseudoliva occurs 

 well up on the l)ody and is nothing more than a deep spiral sulcus 

 in the sculpture pattern and differs very decidedly from the deep 

 spiral sulcus at the base of the body of Seminola. The Xassida? 

 usually have a crenulate or dentate outer lip and lack the marginal 

 fold on the anterior end of the columella and do not have such a deep 

 spiral sulcu>: at the base of the body which terminates in a tooth on 

 the outer lij) of the aperture.

 i\ conspifuous spiral .sulcus which separates the body from the 

 pillar; aperture subovate, grooved posteriorly and produced anteriorly 

 into a short, broad, slightly recurved canal; outer lip thin and crenu- 

 lated along the margin in harmony with the spiral sculpture, thickened 

 or varicose in very oltl individuals; inner lip excavated and calloused; 

 parietal wash very thick and heavy in old individuals; columella 

 reinforced, marked l)y a very oblique fold near the anterior extremity 

 and along the margin of the anterior canal; pillar short and broad; 

 umbilical chink shallow; anterior fasciole a broad and oblique ridge 

 registering the incremental stages of the anterior canal, extremity 

 broadly and quite deeply emarginate. 



Dimensions (immature individual). — Altitude 54.5 nun.; maximum 

 diameter 35 mm. 



This magnificent species is common at Coon Creek but even though 

 the shells are thick and fairly strong the specimens are nearly always 

 crushed as they occur in the matrix, so that perfect specimens are 

 rarely obtained. The shells reach considerable dimensions; imperfect 

 specimens in the collection show that some individuals had an 

 altitude of about 80 mm. and a maximum diameter of about 50 mm. 

 The species is well characterized by the retractive axials which are 

 unusually elevated and strongly rounded. The interaxials are 

 unusual because they are so deep and narrow. The spiral sculpture 

 consists of both primary and secondary cords. The peculiar spiral 

 sulcus at the base of the body is conspicuous on the outer wall of the 

 shell l)Ut ])r()(luces little or no effect on the inner surface of the shell 

 wall within the Ijody cavity.

 shallow and ol)seure; anterior fasciole well defined, deeply emarginate 

 at its extremity. 



Dimensions. — Altitude 24.4 mm.; maximum diameter 19.4 mm. 



This species is well characti-rized by its low spire and globose 

 outline. It differs from Seminold crassa in that it is much smaller 

 in size, in character of the i)ilhir and in having long axial costae 

 parallel to the axis and ])ersisting from the shoulder to well down on 

 the anterior part of the body. The axial costie of Seniinola crassa 

 are retractive and more deeply impressed, even in young individuals. 

 »S. .soUda has a ])illar and marginal columellar fold much the same as 

 Gabb's species of this genus, which was described under the name 

 of \assa globosa-'' but that species is much larger, its external ornamen-

 posteriorly, forming a broad shoulder behind and a decidetl con- 

 striction at the base of the l)ody; aperture sul)circular, produced in 

 front into a short, slightly curved canal with proximate parallel 

 margins, outer lip thickened a little along the margin, serrated by 

 the extremities of the four spiral ridges, shallow sulcus occurring on 

 the inner surface beneath each spiral ridge of the outer surface, two 

 low dcntieU's developed between each pair of sulci along the inner

 the body, sharply angulated at the entrance of the anterior canal; 

 umbilicus profound; umbilical keel prominent, slightly varicose and

Dimensions. — Altitude 11.4 mm.; maximum diameter 9.5 mm. 

 This species is well characterized by its low but acute spire, its 

 four strong spiral ridges and further by a .slightly dentate inner 

 margin of the outer lip. It is represented in the Coon Creek collec- 

 tion l)y four or five specimens, the one selected for the type is perfectly 

 preserved and its generic relations can hardly be doubted. This 

 elegant little species is of special interest since it is the first repre- 

 sentative of this genus, so well known in the later Tertiary of the 

 Atlantic Coastal Plain to be found in the Upper Cretaceous.' No 

 Eocene representatives are known from the Coastal Plain of the 

 United States so that the discovery of a typical Ecphora in the 

 Upi)er Cretaceous indicates that species of this well known genus 

 may be expected in the earliest Tertiary marine sediments of. the 

 Southeastern United States. About a half-dozen species of Ecphora 

 are known from the Oligocene and the Miocene ami are given in 190^3- 

 in Cossmann's Essais de Palioconchologie Comparie as follows:

 .sharply differentiated from the conchs. Both nuclei are elevated 

 or trochoid but that of the type specie.s is the higher. The apical 

 tips or initial points of the protoconchs of both species are immersed 

 in the later nuclear turns but this is probably more pronounced in 

 E. proquadricosiata. 



Genu- PARAMOREA n. gen. 



Etymology: llapd, near, Moiea, a genus of gastropods. 



Type: Paramorea lirala n. sp. 



Shell small and porcellanous, ovate-conic in outline; spire acute, 

 less than half the total altitude of the shell; protoconch scar small; 

 ■conch solid and slightly glazed, paucispiral; axial sculjiture absent; 

 spiral sculpture well tlefined; aperture ovate, deeply notched in front; 

 outer lij) well rounded, its margin simple or slightly crenulated; inner 

 lip excavated and thinly glazed; columella slender and marked l)y a 

 feeble oblicjue plait or twist of the pillar near the anterior extremity; 

 unii)ilical chink narrow, obli(iue and deep, canal short and broad. 



This genus is propo.sed to include a single species from Coon Creek 

 which seems to represent a group of univalves related to Morea. 

 This species is well characterized by its sharp spiral .sculpture, deeply 

 notched ajierture, and further by its very oblique and narrow um- 

 bilicus or umbilical chink with a general a.spect and generic features 

 that do not allow it to fit naturally into any known genus of related 

 shells. The type of the genus Morca^ was described from. the Hijiley 

 formation. Two or three species other than the t\i)e also occur at 

 that horizon so that it is not surprising to find another group related 

 to this very unique genus in the I'jjper Cretaceous of the soutiiea.><tern 

 states. The genus I'ardmornt differs from Mona in having instead 

 of a well defined uml)ilicus a narrow and obli(|Ue chink, and in the 

 development of only spiral ornamentation instead of both spiral and 

 a.\ial, in the acute spire and in the absence of a strongly retlected 

 inner lip such as that of Mono. In general a.spect, i. e., the acute 

 .spire, strong spiral sculpture and narrow umbilicus this genus greatly 

 reseml)les Trichotropin in features as i)resented by the recent North 

 Atlantic species Trichotropin borealin Broderijj and Sowerby,™ but 

 differs from that form in having a stnmg anterior notch or short open 

 canal. In 1889, C. .\. White descril)ed and figured an imperfect 

 specimen from the Chico series of Shasta county, California, a species

 Stomatia obstrida White,^' although it is represented by a cast, i)re- 

 sents an outline together with a spiral ornamentation and an indica- 

 tion of an uuii)ilical chink which suggest the genus Paramorca. 

 Until more perfect specimens of the California species are known its 

 generic jxisition will probably remain uncertain. 



Paramorea lirata n. sp. PI. XVII, figs. 9, 10. 



Description. — Shell small and porcellanous, ovate-conic in outline; 

 spire acute, its elevation a little less than the length of the aperture; 

 whorls closely appressed and shouldered; increasing in size with a 

 fair ilegree of rapidity; protoconch scar small; sculpture sharply 

 spiral, consisting of six well defined line on the penult and thirteen 

 on the ultima, lirae strongest and most widely spaced on the posterior 

 edge of the whorls, on the anterior portion of the body the spiral 

 threads are closely spaced, the interspaces being narrower than the 

 liriE, lira? intersected antl slightly interrupted by incremental lines; 

 suture distinct; body abruptly constricted posteriorly, forming a 

 narrow shoulder, body convex medially and well rounded in front; 

 ai)erture ovate, deeply notched anteriorly; outer lip evenly rounded^ 

 very slightly crenulated along the margin, subangular and a little 

 thickened at the entrance of the anterior canal; inner lip excavated, 

 parietal wall washed with a thin callus; columella slender, marked 

 by a very feeble and oblique fold or twist of the pillar near the 

 anterior extremity; umbilical chink very narrow and oblique, the 

 la-st of the body spirals abnormal and constituting an obtuse umbilical 

 keel; anterior canal short and open. 



Ditnensions. — Altitude 7.8 mm.; maximum diameter 4.7 mm. 



Only two individuals of this elegant little sjx'cies, which is the 

 iypa of the genus, are known. Tlicy arc well characterized by their 

 sjjiral ornamentation, deeply notched aperture and further by the 

 very oi^liciue and narrow umbilical chink. The shell material is 

 I)orcellanous and hard. One of the specimens has a brownish axial 

 banding fixed in the shell material which seems to be ;i rciim;mt of 

 an ancient color pattern.

 acute; aperture less than one-third a.s high as the entire shell; whorls 

 of conch numerous, flattened and wide, increasing in size regularly 

 and slowly: protoconch small and trochoid, coiled al^out three times, 

 line between the conch and protoconch poorly defined; external 

 surface usually smooth and glazed; sculpture absent and subdued; 

 incremental varices occasionally present; suture simjile and distinct j 

 body abruptly constricted in front of the periphery into the short, 

 curved pillar; aperture lenticular, angular behind and produced in 

 front into a short canal ; outer lip thin and simple; inner lip excavated; 

 parietal wall glazed; columella smooth. 



This genus is propo.sed to include a group of gastropods charac- 

 terized by simple, elongate-conical shells with unadorned external 

 surfaces. The aperture is subovate, considerably narrowed towanl 

 each end, terminating anteriorly in a short canal. Besides the type^ 

 two other species arc known, one of which was described under the 

 name of Cerithium {Fibula ?) detedum^'- by Stoliczka from the Arria- 

 loor group of beds from the Upper Cretaceous of South India: the 

 other under the name of Pscudomelania nstonensisi^^ by Huddleston 

 from the upper division of the Inferior (Oolite of England. Xudivagus 

 dilTers from Ceritliium, however, in the character of the aperture and 

 in the absence of a strongly twisted columella and from Clava in 

 having a non-plicate columella. Xudivayus is pr(jbai)ly near Gymno- 

 ccrithiiun^* but dilTers from the latter in having le.ss numerous whorls 

 which are of greater height and less convexity. The new genus 

 dilTers from I*,seudomclani(i in the presence of an anterior canal. 

 Meek's genus ClosteriscuK^ includes elongato-conical forms somewhat 

 .similar to S'tidivagua in outline and lack of (>xternal ornamentation, 

 but the former, however, pos.se.sses well defined tooth-like, internal 

 varices not found in the body cavities of the latter.

 surface highly i)olished; sculpture absent, excepting for very fine and 

 crowded spirals and faint incrementals, discernible with a lens in the 

 glaze of the external surface; suture indicated by a simple slightly 

 imjiressed spiral line; body abruptly constricted in front of the 

 periphery and produced into a narrow recurved pillar; aperture 

 lenticular; terminating anteriorly in a narrow, rather long, recurved 

 canal; outer lip thin and simple; inner lip excavated medially, washed 

 with a thin callus; columella smooth. 



Dimensions (slightly imperfect individual). — Altitude 76.2 mm.; 

 maximum diameter 22.5 mm. 



This species is the type of the genus and is well characterized by 

 its broad, flat whorls and the fine, crowded spiral lines that show 

 through the glaze of the external surface. The shells are relatively 

 thick but not strong. They are fairly common at Coon Creek, but 

 so fragile that not a single perfect specimen has as yet been recovered 

 from the sediments.

 roundfd and retractive; spirals'lirate; suture impressed; body equally 

 con^strictt'd in front and behind; aperture D-shaped and produced 

 in front into a short shallow canal; outer lip thickened and dentate; 

 parietal wall wa.«ihed with a callus; umbilicus imj^erforate. 



This genus is ver>' much like Cerithiodcrma Conrad""^ in general 

 outline, the circular cross-section of the wliorls and in the axial and 

 spiral sculpture, but differs from it in the less acuminate spire and 

 the imperff)rate umbilicus. It resembles P<dadmdv (lardner,-^^ but 

 differs fnjm that group in having a short anterior canal. The genus 

 is proposed to include a species recently discovered at Coon Creek 

 and two other known Mpecies in the European Upper Cretaceous.

 species, including Chemnilzia cerilhiformis, recently collected from 

 Coon Creek, it seems that Meek and Hay den's species wa,s an Acirsa 

 and that the other two Tennessee species are congeneric. 



Acirsa corragata n .«p. l'\. XVIII. fig. 9. 



Description. — Shell small and slender; form elongate-conic, spire 

 acuminate; whorls eleven in number, slightly convex and increasing 

 in size regularly and very slowly; protoconch scar small; sculpture 

 elaborate, consisting of both axial and spiral elements; axial eleva-

 lower and more widely spaced on the later volutions; spiral sculjjture 

 overriding the axials, but very obscure on their summits; spiral sculp- 

 ture ((tnsisting of low, crowih-d thread-like lira', sixteen to twenty in 

 number on the later whorls of the spire and with slightly wider 

 ad<litional spirals on the ba.se of the body; intersi)iral areas nuirked

body very slightly constricted in front of the postericjr margin; 

 peripheral angle obtase, base of body obliquely flattened or very 

 broadly rounded; aperture holostomoiLs, broadly and obliquely 

 ovate, angulated at the posterior commissure; outer lip thin and 

 simple, slightly patulous in front; inner lip excavated medially, 

 thin and reflected, adnate to the body wall; columella smooth. 



Dimeniiions. — Altitude 14.7 mm.; maximum diameter 4.1 mm. 



This species 'is well characterized by its sharply defined axial costs 

 which are crowded on the early whorls of the spire but become more 

 widely spaced on the later volutions, and further, the species is 

 characterized by fine regular pittings in the interspiral spaces. Both 

 Acirsa corrugata and Acirsa microdriata iliffer from Acirsn cerithi- 

 formis M. and H.'^ in the more elongate and slender outline and the 

 details of the external ornamentation. Acirsa corrugata is smaller 

 than Acirsa microstriata and unlike the latter exhibits a well developed 

 axial sculpture over the entire shell. 



The very elegantly ornamented species Scalaria detise-striata 

 Kaunhowen," from the Miestrichtian of western Eurojie is j^robably 

 a mrmber of the genus Acirsa and may be comparetl with Acirsa 

 corrugata.

Description. — Shell fairly large for the group, slender, turritcd 

 and conical in outline; spire acuminate; spire of the type slightly 

 curved, possibly an individual characteristic due to three accidt-nts 

 in the life of the animal, each of which resulted in the breaking of 

 the shell (a.s scars on the type specimen show) on the same side of 

 the spire or possibly a specific charact<'r of this many-whorle<l form; 

 whorls flattened, very closely appressed posteriorly, le.ss tightly 

 coiled toward the aperture; whorls twelve and a half on the imperfect 

 type, at least two hav«' been l)roken away, volutions increju^ing 

 gradually in size; protoconch unknown; sculpture dominantly axial, 

 axial costflB abruptly eU^vated and subangular on thecre.sts, somewhat 

 flexuous, costa' sixteen in innnber on the body of the type, regularly 

 .spaced, persistent from suture to suture on the whorls of the spire, 

 interaxial spaces concave and a little wider than the co.staj; spiral

consist iHfi oi rU'Vi'ii on the body whorl and about the same number 

 on the whorls of the spire; spiral lines on base of body very faint; 

 suture impressed; base of body nearly fiat; angular edge • between 

 Inise and sides of body well rounded; aperture ovate; margin of outer 

 lip broken away; inner lip strongly and smoothly excavated medially; 

 parietal wall washed with a thin glaze of callus; columella smooth. 



Dinunsions (apex of individual broken away). — Altitude 39.4 mm. ; 

 maxinmm chameter 11.1 mm. 



This species is well characterized by its long, slender, rather large 

 spire, and its flattened ba.se, by its well defined axial costic but 

 obscure spirals. Whether the bend in the spire is an individual or 

 specific character of this many-whorled species cannot be determined 

 without additional material. Only one specimen is known at present 

 but it is of special significance since it is the first evidence of the 

 presence of this genus in the Upper Cretaceous. In Europe a number 

 of species of Hemiacirsa have been reported ranging in age from the 

 Montian^^ up to the recent species now living in the Gulf of Lyons. 

 One species only is known from the Eastern United States. This is 

 Hemiacirsa perlaqueata (Conrad) Cossmann." a form originally 

 described as a Turriklla by Conrad,^ later referred to the genus 

 Trachyrhynchus Morch by Martin"*^ and finally to the genus 

 Hemiacirsa by Cossraann in 1912.

mellar plait on the body is another plait similar to a columcllar fold; 

 parietal wall glazed with callus; umbilicus imperforate. 



This genus is well characterized by three conspicuous folds on the 

 inner lip. The most po.sterior of these folds is situated on the l)ody 

 of the preceding whorl and the other two occur on the columella. 

 The posterior one of the columellar plaits is the stronger and on 

 either side of it there is a deep columellar sulcus. The genus is 

 probably near Pynunidella, but the umbilicus of that genus is typi- 

 cally imperforate. The genus Creonella is proposed for a group 

 represented by two species from Coon Creek which are unlike any 

 known .species of this family in either the Upper Cretaceous or the 

 early Tertiary. A representative of the genus Obcliscn^ which 

 occurs at Coon Creek and aLso in the Monmouth of New Jersey, has 

 a single columellar plait, otherwise, in simple, slender, conical forms 

 of the inornate shells, the two groups resemble each other very much.

COLPICHTHYS. THYRINOPS. AND AUSTEOMENIDIA, 

 New Genera of Atherinoid Fishes from the New World. 



BY CARL L. HUBBS. 

 COLPICHTHYS mw Konu,. 



Genotype. — Atlierinops regis Jenkins and Evermann fChilf of 

 Calif orniaj. 



Colpichthys regis is related to the specie.s of Atherinops, with wliic-h 

 it ha.s heretofore been considered con^;enerit'. But the Gulf species 

 differs in so many ways from the typical species from the outer 

 coasts of Lower California, and from California and Oregon, that a 

 new genus may he erected for its sole rece])tion. 



Compared with Atfierinups, Colpichthys may l)e distinguished as 

 follows. The head is depressed, although the body is deeper and 

 more strongl>' comjiressed than in Atherinops. The mouth is sub- 

 inferior, being i)U a level with the lower margjn of the eye; the u]>per 

 li|) is thickened. The uni-serial teeth arc Y-shaped, but the inner 

 fork is usually nnich the shorter. The gill-rakt-rs, IG to 18 in number 

 along the lower limb of the outer arch, are strongly compressed, 

 curved, serrate on their imur margins, and relatively short, being 

 about one-fourth as long as the eye. In typical Atherinops the gill- 

 rakers are rather more numerous, 20 to 2.'). and they are slender, 

 terete, straight, nearly >mooth. and about t\vi>-Hfths as long as the 

 eye. 



The scales of ('olpichthijs differ markedly from those of Atherinops, 

 although <-on><truct<'d on a similar i)lan. The po.«<terior or exposed 

 field of tln' scale is marked outwanl from the focus to tlu' first amuilus 

 or sea.>«jnal ring by circuli similar to those of the anteri»>r field, but 

 l)eyond this mark the circuli assume a sharply and irregularly undu- 

 lat<' course paralleling the |)ost<'rior margin of the scale. In 

 AtherinopH proper (.1. ojfinis) the circuli of the posterior field through- 

 out maintain u nearly even course, and are all greatly crowded, while 

 in ('otpirhthi/s only those in the annuli or y«'ar checks are closely 

 approximated. In ('olpiehthtjs there are about six basal radii within 

 the first annutus. beyond which thi* number is abruptly decrea.se<i. 

 In Atherinops, on the other hand, the ra<iii are often absent. Itut on 



.som«' scales I. 2. <tr eVJ-n '.\. are in evidelire :inil tlie-e nidii :ire not

modified at the first annulus. In Colpichthys further, the scales 

 are rather thicker and larger than in Atherinops, the number of trans- 

 verse series 47 to 51, instead of 52 to 72. 

 (Colpichthys, a fish of the bay or gulf.) 



THYEIN0P8 new genus. 



Genotype. — Atherinichthys pachylepis Giinther, 1864 ( = Menidia 

 pachylepis Jordan and Evermann 1896 = Thyrina pachylepis 

 Jordan and Evermann 1898, and Regan 1907 = Kirtlandia pachy- 

 lepis Gilbert and St arks 1904). 



Thyrinops pachylepis, the only species of the genus, occupies a 

 position almost exactly intermediate between Kirtlajidia and Athe- 

 rinella, agreeing with both of these genera as well as with Menidia, 

 etc., in the posterior position of the anal fin, which is not advanced 

 as in Thyrina and Eurystole. Thyrina closely resembles Thyrinops, 

 and is proV)al)ly a fresh-water derivative from some such form. 

 This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that some species of 

 Thyrina, especially T. sardina, have the scales on the sides more or 

 less laciniate. 



Thyrinops may be diagnosed as follows: form moderately slender, 

 contracted ventrally as in Thyrina. Head rather pointed; gape 

 .strongly arched downward posteriorly; jaws forming a semicircular 

 cur\'e when viewed from above; maxillary not reaching to below 

 front of orbit. Teeth in villiform bands, rather wide in the upper 

 jaw. l)Ut narrow in the lower; outer series of jiremaxillary teeth 

 spaced and a little enlarged; entire palate toothless. Scales thick- 

 en('<l. rather deeper than long; the free margin rounded, but the 

 dorsal, vrntral, and l)asal margins nearly straight; circuli al)sent 

 fron) the apical field, which is crossed by numerous fine, subparallel 

 radii, between which the .scale is produced so as to form a liorder 

 more finely laciniate than in Mcinbras (Kirllandia) ; ba.sal Held usually 

 crossed by a line or two along which the circuli are curveil inward; 

 ba-sal ra<lii usually absent on the trunk scales, or only a few shallow 

 ones developed, whereas on the tail the scales are deeply .sculpt uri'd 

 with well developed radii;' The number of .scales is about 40 in 

 lateral series. Fin rays: dorsal, IV or VI, 6 to 8; anal I, 20 to 23. 

 Anal ba.se <h*cidedly longer than head, as in Thyrina; .soft dorsal and 

 anal fin.s .scalel<*ss, falcate in outline; origin of spinous dorsal well 

 b< hind that of the anal, about an orbital lengtli separating the two

verticals; pectorals falcate and elongate, reaching nearly to or even 

 beyond, the tips of the pelvic fins. 



Two specimens of T. pachylepis are at hand; they were collected 

 January 5, 1908, by Anai>ta.sio Alfaro, in the Estero at Tivives near 

 Pantarenas in Costa Rica. Lengths to base of caudal, 88 and 113 

 nun. The so-called annuli or .seasonal rings on the scales are well 

 <levelopetl, and resemble those of California Atherinids; the scales 

 show respectively 2 and 3 of these rings, prol)ably indicating the 

 age in years of the two fishes. Dorsal rays, IV-I, 7 (both .specimens) ; 

 anal, I, 20 and I, '21; pectorals reaching a little pa.st tips of pelvics, 

 their length iK'ing contained 3.4 and 3.6 times in the total. Scales 

 40-9 and 42-9.

Austrnnienidin is used to replace Bosilichthyx of authors and not of

 troptrrus and Piaciregiit . 



The fishes of this geniis, referable to several species. inlial»it both 

 <'oasts of .southern South America. They are of comparatively 

 large size, and are of commercial importance. The scales are notably 

 small, nmnbering from (»7 to over 100 in lateral .series. Hoth jaws 

 are strong and arched downward posteriorly; the |)remaxillary is 

 ililated distally. The teeth are disposed in narrow bands along the 

 jaws, and are usually absent from the vonur, althotigh a few teeth 

 or even a small patch, may be |>resent on that bone. The first dorsal 

 tin begins w«'ll before the anal, at a point about midway between base 

 of stiout and ba.se of caudal. 



\{ will be noted from the foregoing diagnosis that Anstromenidia 

 reseml)les Mcnidia very closely, dilTering from it in the larger size, 

 the stronger jaws, and the nmch finer scales. 



Tin- species of Chirnstnnin, conline<l to the fauna ()f the Lerma 

 River System in .Mexico, form a large series with (livers<' extremes, 

 'i'he scales are usually larger (37 to 75)' than in Austromenidia; the

lower jaw stronger, projecting beyond the upper, at least at the 

 symphysis.' and forcing the gape into an oblicjue direction. 



Species of "Atherinichthys" have been recorded by Giinther and 

 others from Australia and Tasmania, but they cannot be congeneric 

 with any New World genera.* The same is true of Atherinichthys 

 nouluiyiii Weber^ from New Guinea. The original type of Athe- 

 ritiichthys is identical with that of Chirostoma an earlier name. 



Two genera related to Austromenidia, Odonteslhes and Kronia, 

 have been described from the east coast of South America. 



Odontesthes Evermann and Kendall^ has a peculiarly pikelike 

 form, produced by the strength of the jaws, and by the positions of 

 the dorsal and anal fins, which are inserted much farther back than 

 in Austrometiidia; the spinous dorsal originates nearly opposite the 

 anal. The scales are of medium size (about 50 to 70 transverse 

 series). The teeth on the jaws are in two series-, and there are 2 or 3 

 groups of vomerine teeth. Kronia, recently describetl by Ribeiro,^ 

 is said to have 3 linear groups of vomerine teeth; large sublaciniate 

 scales (in 54 series); and the dorsal origin directly over the anus. 

 Perhaps Kronia is synonymous with Odontesthea, but it is not the 

 same as Austromenidia} 



* The species have all been recxjimined as regards this character; the single 

 exception i.s C. promelaa, in which the upper jaw has secondarily become hookod 

 over the lower, somewhat ;is in tlip hn'cding male of Onnirfnjiichus.

Since the publication of the first paper of this series,' the writer 

 has been able to study part of the miportant collection of Hawaiian 

 marine shells made l)y Professor Wm. Alanson Bryan and Mrs. 

 Bryan, which they had brought to the Academy for identification. 

 It is very rich in the shells of Kauai, Oahu and Molokai, also several 

 of the islets of the northwestern group as far as Laysan. The present 

 paper treats also of shells collected by Mr. D. Thaanum, minutiaj 

 picked out of shell-sand sent many years ago l)y Mr. Frederick

The .shell is slender, turrited, with long, attenuate spire, cinnamon 

 colored, or nearly white with cinnamon bands. Nuclear shell of one 

 smooth elevated whorl, the spire exposed, low. Post-nuclear whorls 

 are moderately convex, with sculpture of close, rounded, axial ribs, 

 their intervals deep ami equal to the ribs on the upper whorls, about 

 half as wide as the ril)s on the last four whorls. There are also 

 swollen white varices as wide as three to five ribs, at irregular intervals, 

 more numerous in the lower whorls; in all 8 in the specimen shown 

 in fig. 5. The axial ribs and varices are crossed by rather strong 

 spiral cords, about 10 between sutures, the fourth from above being 

 a little larger than the others. The last whorl is rounded periph- 

 erally and has a short, convex base. The aperture is trapezoidal, 

 angular at the base of the columella. Columella vertical, with a 

 sharp, very oblique spiral fold at the base. Parietal callous scarcely 

 noticeable. 



Length 22. diam. 4.7, length of aperture 4.2 mm.; 15 post-nuclear

 Turbonillas having conspicuous vertical and sj)iral sculj^ture, a

 spiral fold emerging 7icar the base of the columella. In this last

The shell is oblong-conic, white, Nuclear whorls are worn. The 

 rest of the wluirls of th*' spire have two broad, rounded, contiguous 

 .««piral ridges in the upper part. In the last whorl the ridges are more 

 separated, the lower one being narrower and median on the whorl: 

 tlu're is also a third and snuillcr ridge around the axial region. Over 

 the whole surface there is a dense microscopic spiral striation. The 

 apertur»' is oblique, the outer lip irregular. The columella is very

VI. THE OSTREID^. 



Of the four species of Ostrea known from the islands, two ari' 

 apparently extinct. The existing species are quite small oysters. 

 O. sandvichensis is common on stone and shell bottom in Pearl 

 Harbor. 0. hanleyana appears to inhabit open shore and reefs. 



Professor Bryan- has recorded the unsuccessful attempts to 

 introduce eastern and Californian oysters. It could not reasonably 

 be expected that oysters from waters so much colder would thrive. 

 and so far a.s is known, they have died out completely. There is a 

 large valve of the \'irginia oyster in the Bryan collection, j^icked out 

 of material dredged m Honolulu Harbor, j)robably a ballast shell.

 corrugation, antl the beaks are often very long. This form may 

 prove to be a distinct species when perfect specimens come to hand. 

 It may temporarily be called O. sandvichensis )nnrgarit(c (PI. 21,

According to Bryan, the native name of this oyster is pioeoe. It is 

 too small to be of econonic value.

 is small, shortly oval. There is some minute crenulation of the 

 inner edges near the beaks, which are always very short. The 

 u-ual length is 35 to 60 mm.

Pearl Harbor, Oahu (Bryan, Kuhns, Pil.sbry). 



This oyster has not yet been found living, the specimens being 

 from deposits believed to be |)leistocene. on the shores of Pearl 

 Harbor. I found it in abundance in a railroad cut about one-fourth 

 mile east (jf Waipio, where a section of the ancient oyster bed is 

 exposed. 



It lias been taken by Prof, and Mrs. Bryan at \N aipaliu, :ind by 

 Kuhns and Bryan on the southern border of Ford's Ishuid. 



The extinction of the species may have l)een due to an inflow of 

 hot water from one of the tufa cones northward, as Prof. Bryan 

 suggests to me; or |)ossil)ly a heavy fall of volcanic ash was l)lown 

 over Pearl Harbor, and the shell fish were smotliered by the turbid 

 water. \\ all events, the species has not l)een found elsewhere in 

 the islands. <'ither recent or fossil. We may infer that it had been

 The Hut upper valve is generally smooth except for the u.sual rough 

 growth-lines. Both have erenulated inner edges when young, as 

 shown in the figures, but this feature is generally indistinct or lost 

 in old shells. The lower valve varies from having a rather deep 

 lieak-cavity to none. A large specimen measures 14 cm. long, 6 

 wide; others apparently adult are 10 cm. long.

The shell is very large, ponderous, oblong, extremely thick. The 

 more convex valve has a strong sculpture of rounded radial ridges, 

 .some of which branch: at the lower edge there are alxnit 15. Inside, 

 the beak occupies nearly half the total length. The flat valve has 

 a tliiii hiyer of calcareous material <n'er most of the outside, but it

POLARIZATION AND COLOR EFFECTS EXHIBITED BY CERTAIN DIATOMS 



F. J. KEELEY. 



The June, 1917, issue of the Journal of the Royal Microscopical 

 Society, reprints a paper by E. M. Nelson, descril)ing polarizing 

 effects shown by certain diatoms, in which the suggestion is made 

 that "it may be that silex deposited by animals does not exhibit 

 polariscope effects, while that deposited by plants, such as diatoms, 

 will do so." Hence a satisfactory explanation of this effect seems 

 desirable. 



When plane polarized light impinges on the surface of a transparent 

 isotropic substance so oriented as to be neither parallel nor normal 

 to the plane of polarization, each ray is, to a greater or less extent, 

 resolved into two polarized rays, vibrating parallel and normal to 

 the plane of incidence, transmitted and reflected respectively. If the 

 angle of incidence happens to correspond to the angle of maximum 

 lx)larization of the reflecting substance, the effect will be almost 

 complete, but only partial at other angles. Such reflected and 

 refracted rays, therefore, vibrate in planes different from that of the 

 f)riginal polarized light and would pass through an analyzer placed 

 at right angle to the polarizer. 



In using a polarizing microscope arranged to illuminate the oi)ject 

 with parallel rays and an objective of small aperture, there is little 

 chance of such reflected or refracted rays entering into the formation 

 of the image, and isotropic substances appear dark between crossed 

 prisms no matter what their shape, but the arrangement de.scribed 

 by Mr. Nc'lson includes a condenser above the polarizer and an 

 objective of fairly wide aperture, .5 N. A., under which conditions, 

 rays reflected up to the maximum polarizing angle or their refracted 

 ('(»mj)on<'nts. may be transmitted through the objcctivi', and the 

 <-orresi)onding structural elements of the object will appear bright 

 on a dark field, or modify the field color if a selenite film is interpost'd. 

 The structure of diatcims and other minute silicious organisms is 

 now sufficiently well understood to render it appan-nt that the 

 innumerable surfaces capable of reflecting light, amply account for 

 the i>olarizing effects noted, and. wh<'n illuminated under the de- 

 jHTilwd conditionH, all diatoms, radiolaria, sponge spicules, powdered

glasijs, or even the surface of a grouiul glass plate, will show bright 

 polarization, provided they are mounted dry or in a medium of liigh 

 refractive inilex such as realgar. When in balsam, or other media 

 approximating their own index, the reflections are nearly or quite 

 '■liminatcd and most such objects become invisible, although some 

 of the thicker polycystina and diatoms may still appear faintly 

 contrasted with the black l)ackground. Imt Mr. Nelson calls attention 

 to the interesting fact that there are certain species of diatoms that 

 show almost eciually l)rilliant polarizing effects when mounted in 

 balsam. 



In 1901. there was published in tlusr Proceedings, a short com- 

 munication In' me, relating the results ol)tained from the examination 

 of a series of diatoms in media of various refractive indices, which 

 demonstrated that the secondary structure of certain specie^* of 

 Auhicwli.scus tliffered from that of most diatoms by remaining 

 equally distinct in all media, including a liquid with refractive index 

 1.42 to \A'^, in which diatoms generally became practically invisible. 

 This structure has the appearance of fine granules arranged uni- 

 formly, but not symmetrically, between the larger cells constituting 

 the primary .structure, instead of over or under the latter as is the 

 ca-xi' with the perforated plates forming the .secondary structure of 

 most species of Coscinodiscu.s, Tn'ceratium and many of Aulacodisnts. 

 It is exhibited most distinctly by Auhicodiscu^s formosus. on which 

 it can be well shown with a half inch of .00 X. A., but is jiresent on 

 many species of this genus, including (injus. rogertdi, oreyunu.s, etc.; 

 and is well displayed in a photograph of .1. stitrlii used as one of the 

 illu<trations in recent editions of Carpenter. "The Microscope and 

 its Revelations." It may bo account<'<l for by various hypotheses, 

 among which, by a proce>s of eliminjition. the most satisfying is to 

 assmne that the apparent granules are hermetically do.sed cavities, 

 impenetrable by any inedimn in which the diatom is iinmer.setl. 



It will be found that almost nil the diatoms which exhibit bright 

 polarization when mounted in baham, are included in the species 

 having this secondary structure, and, as it is not iK*nctrated by the 

 l)alsam, the same c^xjilanation will apply as to dry mounted forms. 



Mr, Nel<on specially mentions Aullxcus (Mitnnrutu.sis as giving a 

 most charming image with polarized light, and it is likewi.se one of 

 thr' best forms available for elucidating the subject. This was one 

 of the species which I formerly studied sectionally. and the markings 

 consist (tf slender tul)es p«iiet rating an unusually thick silicious 

 pl.it. . It was not inchnled aniong those t-xamined in media of

cliflfereiit refractive imlices, but its appearance under high, powers 

 indicates that the tubules are not penetrated by the mounting 

 metliuni. Its most important characteristic for the present purpose 

 is that the markings do not extend throughout the valve but are 

 confined to curved bands with clear interspaces and a large area of 

 clear silica in the center. On examination with polarized light, 

 using the highest power and aperture objective that will stand dark 

 field illumination without halation, which in my experience, is a 

 4 mm. of .05 N. A., it will be noted that the polarizing effect is 

 confined strictly to the tubular markings, while the interspaces and 

 central area remain dark, indicating that the silica, itself, is entirely 

 devoid of polarizing action. 



Probably everyone who has mounted many slides of selected and 

 arranged diatoms, has at times been annoyed to find that the gjlatine 

 fixative has sealed up some of the cellular structure of the diatoms, 

 preventing penetration by the mounting medium and producing 

 unsightly patches. However unsightly, they become interesting 

 with polarized light as the manner in which the air filled cells light 

 up, while the remainder of the valve is practically invisible, can 

 leave no doubt in the mind of the observer as to the cause of the 

 polarization effect. This was particularly noticeable on an arranged 

 group of marine diatoms from California, which on completic^n, I 

 regarded as greatly impaired by the manner in which the central 

 portion of sL'veral valves of Hyalodiscus maximus had been rendered 

 semi-opacjue by the gelatine preventing complete penetration of 

 the balsam. With polarized light, the minute air filled c?lls closely 

 resembled, except in their .symmetrical arrangement, the corresjiond- 

 ing a.ssumedly air filled cells of the secondary structure o{ Aidacodiscus 

 formofm.s. A similar condition seems to exist naturally in Hyalodiscus 

 subtilis, in which the so called umbilicus contains markings like the 

 margin, but being impenetrable to balsam, remains comparatively 

 dark when mounted in that medium, while the outer zone becomes 

 very transparent. It is hardly necessary to add, that the central 

 space reacts with polarized light. 



Microseopi.'<ts accu.stomed to the emi)loymeiit of polarized light 

 for the purpose of determining whether a substance is isotropic or 

 doubly refracting, have long been familiar with the effects of reflec- 

 tion and refraction and the necessity of avoiding them by the use of 

 parallel illumination and mounting media of similar refraction to 

 the material examined. In this explanation. I luive confined my.self 

 t(» i)lienomen'.i connected with the elTect of -ueh reflection ;m(l 




1917.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 337 



refract iom on plane polarized light, hut in an exhaustive treatment 

 of the subject it would he necessary to further consider that plane 

 polarized light, hy internal total reflection or leHection from metallic 

 8urface.s, at certain angles, may become circularly or <'lliptically 

 polarized, and in this form pass through the analyzing prism. This 

 may account for the fact that light ri'flected from the edge of a tin 

 foil cell, used l)y some preparers in mounting selected diatoms, will 

 appear bright between crossed prisms except where .such edge is 

 ])arallel to the axis of either prism. 



In the communication referred to above, I mentioned that some of 

 the species of Aiilncoflisciifi with the peculiar secondary structure, 

 exhibiteil bright coh^rs with ordinary triuismitted light, which I was 

 then unable to account for, but which I would now suggest may l»e 

 due to optical resonance. The group of phenom<'na classed under 

 this head, includes the scattering of light by particles or molecules 

 in the atmo.sphere, causing the blue color of the sky, and similar but 

 not identical effects jiroduced by minute particles emlx'dded in or 

 deposited on the surface of solids. The latter phase of the subject 

 has been extensively studied in connection with the so calletl "ultra 

 microscopy" and it is unnecessary to give details here beyond 

 stating that (^ne of the methods of illustrating it consists of ilis- 

 tributing minute globules of gold on a glass surface by means of 

 electrical discharges from the end of a gold wire. Such films reflect 

 various colors acccjrding to the size of the particles and transmit 

 the complementary color. 



Some years ago. Mr. T. ('. l*almer calleil my attention to the 

 possibility of depositing thin films of gold from a solution of its 

 chloride in collodion, and gave me some of the prepared .solution, 

 with which I experimented in (lei)ositing the gold on variou«< organic 

 structures with the view of their elucidation, but ftjund the film too 

 coarsely granular to be generally satisfactory. The films, wIumi de- 

 posited on glass, transmitted various colors, generally dark blue, 

 and one in particular, after heating until the surface of the glass was 

 fused, gives brilliant red and blue color eflfects by transmitted light, 

 reflecting the complementary grci'n and orange tints, due to oi)tical 

 re.soiumce from the minute granules in which the metal was deposited. 

 On examination under the microscoix', the granular film shows a 

 -tart ling resemblance to the s«'con<lary structure of the group of 

 .Vulacodiscj previously referred to, and suggests that the color shown 

 by some of them with transmitted light may be due to the .same 

 caus<'. In most of these diatoms the structure is too coar>e t<» 

 •24

produce color by this means, merely gi^■illg them a more or less 

 opaque or sometimes metallic appearance, but in such forms as 

 A. Oregon us, in which tlie structure is almost as fine as on the gold 

 film descriljed, fairh' bright colors appear, generally a bronzy green 

 l)y transmitted light, and the complementary color, pink, when 

 illuminated from above, which is as it should be, if the color is due to 

 optical resonance from the granules of the secondary' structure. 



But the diatoms that show by far the brightest colors by trans- 

 mitted light, are certain species of Adinocyclus, notably 7-alfsii, in 

 which, as far as I am aware, no secondary structure has hitherto been 

 noted, yet if this theorj^ was correct they should contain such a 

 structure and, to account for the brighter colors, it should be finer 

 than in any species of Aulacodiscus. On examination, this structure 

 was readily foimd to be present and particularly visible in the central 

 blank space and wedge shaped radial segments between the coarser 

 cellular structure of A. ralfsii. It is extremely delicate and will afford 

 an excellent test for the definition of wide aperture objectives, although 

 after finding it with an oil immersion antl selecting a well-marked 

 valve, was al^le to see it distinctly with a well-corrected water immer- 

 sion of about 1.00 N. A., and even with an exceptionally fine thy 

 objective of slightly less aperture. 



If it should prove that this structure in Adinocyclus has been 

 previously seen by others (as is usually the case with all supposedly 

 new observations with the microscope) it will not make the slightest 

 difference in this connection, as it was entirely unsuspected and new 

 to me, and being found, not by accident, but because its presence 

 was indicated theoretically, it seems to furnish rather strong evidence 

 in favor of the correctness of the theory. As in the case of Aulaco- 

 disciis, Actinocyclus shows complementary colors with transmitted 

 and reflected liglit, and fairly bright jiolarizing effects when mounted 

 in balsam. On examination in a fluid of about 1.43 refractive index, 

 it remained visible and showed bright colors by transmitted light. 



All the diatoms with this jK'Culiar secondary structure which I 

 have as yet examined in media of various refractive indices, show 

 brighter, higher order colors as the refractive index is increased, 

 although the structure itself shows no change in visibility, indicating 

 that the internal .structure is combined with surface irregularities 

 that permit the index of the medium to modify the color in accord- 

 ance with the chang(.' in wave length of light transmitted through 

 it. .' A liypothetical view would be that the structure corresponds 

 to that of a foam, both with respect to the internal closed cavities, 

 and the external surface.

REPORT OF THE RECORDING SECRETARY. 



The Recording Secretary respectfully reports that late in Sep- 

 tember, he was disabled by an affection of the right side which has 

 reduced him to a pa.ssive administration of the affairs of his offices 

 of Recortling Secretary and Librarian, the active dUties of the posi- 

 tion being performed by the Assistant Librarian, William J. Fox. 



The Secretary, in the hope of being able to resume the duties of 

 his offices with the oix'ning of the New Year, has been sustained 

 by the sympathy of the President and the other administrators of 

 the Academy, to whom, and to other friends, he returns his sincere 

 thanks. 



The following report, and that of the Librarian, have been prepared 

 by Mr. Fox, whose cfficifncy is cordially recognized by the Secretary 

 and Librarian. 



Acknowledgment is also made to Dr. J. Percy Moore and Dr. Philip 

 P. Calvert for .services at the meetings of the Academy and Council. 



Meetings were held on December Hi, 1910, January Ki, February 

 20, March 20, April 17. June 12, and November 20, 1917. Com- 

 munications were made by William E. Hughes, Mrs. Arthur R. 

 IlifT. John Ci. Kotliermel. IMiilip P. Calvert, and William Alanson 

 Bryan. 



Twenty-thr<'e papers have been presented for pul)lication as

 eighty-four pages, with ten plates, of Memoirs; and five hundred 

 and seven pages, with thirty-one plates, of the Entomological 

 News. 



One hundred and fortj'-three pages, with twenty plates, have 

 been issued of the ]\Ianl\\l of Conchology. 



The total number of pages is two thousand and fifty-five, and 

 131 plates, being an increase of 130 pages and twenty-two plates 

 over last year. 



One hundred and two members and one correspondent have been 

 elected. Fourteen deaths have been announced. Resignations have 

 been received from Warren M. Foote, Theodore Brooks, and Walter 

 Sonneberg. Five were dropped from the roll. 



The increase in new members is due to the activities of the Com- 

 mittee on Membership and Endowment. The financial results of 

 the campaign of this committee will, no doubt, be referred to in the 

 Treasurer's report. 



The special appointments of the Council are as follows: The 

 Standing Committees, the Councillor, the Curator of the William 

 S. \'aux Collections, and the Custodian of the Lea Collections. In 

 addition, there were appointed a Committee of Council on By-Laws, 

 and a Committee on Correspondents,

 The museum stafT has been constantly employed in the ^tudy, 

 arrangenu-nt, and display of the collections in the various depart- 

 ments as described in detail below. 



Most of this work has consisted in carrying out the arrangement 

 of material in the new study and exhibition cases, as (outlined in 

 last year's report, but mtich new material has also been cared for. 



At the .ses.'iion of the State l.egislatiire, which do.seil early in the 

 pa.«-t summer, an aj)propriation of Slo.OOO was made for the needs 

 of the Academy. From this fund it was possible to ])aint tlie entire 

 outside wood and iron work of the building, which was nnich in nee(| 

 of attention. Plans have been prejjared for necessary alterations 

 in the heating plant, which will be carried out at once. The con- 

 sideration of other injprovements niade possible 1)y tlii> appropria-

tion has bei'n temporarily po.>tp(jiied owing to tlie illn»'s.>; (A the 

 President and Executive Curator, Dr. Samuel G. Dixon. 



The attendance of visitors, both the general public and the cla&ses 

 of school f'hildren from the city and nearby towns, has been large, 

 and the educational importance of the museum is con.-tantly in- 

 creasing. 



In field work, Mr. Clarence B. Moore has continuetl his 

 explorations among the Inchan mounds of the J^outhern States. 

 Mr. J. A. G. Rehn, through the liberality of M^r. Morgan Hebard, 

 wa.s enal)led to join him on an entomological tri|) of several weeks 

 in central Florida and northern Georgia, the Academy sharing in 

 the material collected. Dr. Stone received leave of alxsence for 

 .several weeks during the spring and summer, and collected consider- 

 able botanical and entomological material for the Academy in 

 central South Carolina and southern New Jersey, and local field 

 work was carried on l)y various members of the staff. While the 

 Academy sent out no expcdition.s during the year, several valuable 

 collections of mollusks, birds, fishes and in.»<ects were obtained by 

 purchase. 



Details of work in the several departments follow: 



Ma.m.mals. 

 Many osteological preparations have been made by the taxider- 

 mist from material received from the Zoological Society of Phila- 

 delphia, which are ready to Im- placed in the study series, and a 

 number of specimens from the same source, as well a.** two sea lions 

 from the Philadelphia Aquarium, have been prepared ius skins. 

 Material hjts lieen loaned to Dr. .1. A. Allen. 



I^IHDS. 



By r( moving a number of duj)licates fntm the general cxhiliitinn 

 coIlecti(jn of birds, sjjace was si-cun-d for the di>play of a large part 

 of the groups of North American birds recently received from Mr. 

 Geo. B. Benners, an exhii)it which has attract»<l iinich attention. 

 During the spring the services of Mi.xs Kmma P. ^b-rrick were 

 .secured a.s an aid in the ornithological department, and with her 

 help. Dr. Stone was enabled to make a great advanc*- in the arrange- 

 nu'ut of the .study .<eries of bird.-. 



The entire series of hununingbirds were examined and many of 

 tlie specimens made over, while all were identified and relal eled. 

 The .Jewel collection and the Hhojids Guatemala coll' ctioii- w«*re

also identifioil and relabeled, and together with the Carriker collec- 

 tion of Colombian birds, were distributed through the study series, 

 and 1,173 specimens were catalogued. 



The entire collection of birds eggs has been carefully cleansed 

 and Jill the North American specimens placed in uniform glass- 

 covered boxes secured for the purpose. In these they are absolutely 

 protected and present a very handsome appearance. 



Several important accessions have been received, notably the 

 collection of i^ird skins of the late Samuel Wright, presented by 

 Mrs. Wright; the Charles J. Pennock collection of eggs and skins, 

 presented by Mrs. Pennock; and collections of Colombian birds 

 and of Hummingbirds obtained by purchase. A number of visiting 

 ornithologists have made use of the collections during the year and 

 specimens have been loaned to J. E. Law, and W. E. Clyde Todd. 



Reptiles and Batrachians. 



Mr. Henry W. Fowler has had charge of this department and has 

 looked after the welfare of the specimens along with those of the 

 ichthyological department. 200 specimens have been catalogued, 

 representing part of the material received during the year. A 

 number of West Indian reptiles have been loaned to Dr. Thomas 

 Barbour, of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, who is studying 

 them critically and redetermining them while a series of African 

 reptiles has Iwen borrowed l)y the American Museum of Natural 

 History. Mr. (1. K. Noble visited the Museum in the summer 

 and made use of the coiiectic^ns while Mr. E. R. Dunn has studied 

 certain of the Salamanders and in conjunction with Mr. Fowler, 

 has prepared a paper upon them. 



During the summer Dr. Stone and the Taxidermist, Mr. McCad- 

 den, made experiments in preparing casts of local reptiles for ex- 

 hibition and material was obtained for several groups of turtles and 

 toads. Specimens were loaned to Dr. Thos. Barbour, d K. Noble, 

 Mary C. Dicker.son and Karl P. Schmidt. 



Fisiip:s. 



Mr. Fowler reports large accessions to the iclithyologicMl collec- 

 tions, of which 1,134 have been catalogued. He has identified a 

 (•(•Ijection of Philippine fishes for the Philadelphia Commercial 

 Mu.«eum, in return for which the Academy has received a valuable 

 HerieK of specimenH, while in the same way he has secured from the 

 Miiseuin of Comparative Z(K)l(>gy, a series of cypriiioid fishes from 




1917.J NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHfLADELPHIA. 349" 



India. The AcacUmy is again especially indebted to Messrs. E. 

 S. and W. I. Mattem, who have presented collections of local fi.'jhes 

 from various parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, aggregating 

 5,000 specimens. On March 8, the .second meeting of the American 

 Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists was held at the Acad<'my, 

 which brought together specialists in these fields from various parts 

 of the country and proved in every way most successful. 



Three papers dealing with the collections were published by Mr. 

 Fowler during the year. Specimens were loaned to Dr. C. H. Eigen- 

 mann. 



MOLLVSKS. 



Dr. Henry A. Pilsbry, h'j)ecial Curator of MoUusks, states that 

 specimens have been received from 82 persons and institutions since 

 the last report. Among other valuai)l(' gifts were large accessions to 

 the collection of Hawaiian Mollusca, received from Mr. D. Thaanum. 

 of Hilo, Hawaii, and from Prof, and Mrs. W. A. Bryan, of Honolulu, 

 who spent several months at the Academy studying the collections. 

 Also the important Rocky Mountain and Califoniia matrrial from 

 Prof. Junius Henderson and Mr. Jas. H. Ferri.^^s. 



New cases in.stalled last year have permitted the expansion and 

 rearrangement of the whole study series of shells, which is now in 

 excellent order. 



Dr. Pilsbry has completed the first volume of the "Monograph 

 of the Pupillidip," begun la.st year, the final number being now 

 in press. He has also published three papers on the anatomy of 

 West American snails, and in collaboration with Mr. Ferri.ss, a 

 study of the mojlusks of the lilack Hangc, New Mexico. .Vlso 

 papers on Hawaiian marine shells. 



Mr. \'anatta has been occupied with labeling and arranging 

 accessions to th<' collection and in determining specimens for corres- 

 pondents. Miss Ziegler has mad*' good j)rogress in the long task 

 of cataloguing tin- collection of shells. 



The collection has been extensively used by visiting iialuralists. 

 Specimens have been loaned to Dr. Paul Hartsch, Prof. A. E. Wrrill 

 and K. P. ( 'hase. 



Insecth. 



In the dep.iiiiiirnt of Entomology, Dr. Henry Skinner reports 

 that during the year, two thousand three hundred and eight>-six 

 insects have been received, anri the greater part of them has been 

 relaxed, mounted and placed in the ca)>inets. 




350 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



The usual care has been devoted to the preservation of the col- 

 lections antl a considerable amount of rearrangement in the new 

 metal cases carried into effect. In the Coleoptera the family Cer- 

 ambycidae has been rearranged in its entirety. The Siiphidae, 

 Scydmtenidie and Pselaphidse have also been rearrangetl. 



In the Lepidoptera the genus Argynnis has been rearranged, and 

 many ackhtional sjiecimens added. Some work has also been done 

 on the exotic species. Mr. R. C. Williams, Jr., arranged the Lycseni- 

 die according to his studies of the genitalia of the family. 



In the Diptera, Mr. E. T. Cresson, Jr., has continued his system- 

 atic studies of the family Ephydridie, and has also determined and 

 rearranged the Sciomyzidae and Sarcophagidse. 



In the Orthoptera, ^Ir. J. A. G. Rehn has continued the rearrange- 

 ment of the specimens in the new type of large glass-covered boxes, 

 and the work has been nearly completed. Numerous small collections 

 have been mounted, labeled, and stored. A report on extensive 

 Brazilian collections has been completed, as well as a study of the 

 genus Mcryniria both of which will be published as soon as the 

 illustrations are completed. Numerous specimens have been de- 

 termined for correspondents. 



Mr. Morgan Hebard has spent most of his time at the Museum 

 <luring the year and in the course of his studies on his various col- 

 lections, ha.s presented much valuable material to the Academy. 

 His expedition to Florida and Georgia, already referred to, was 

 productive of collections of much importance. Many visiting 

 entomologists have studied the collections of insects during the 

 year and specimens have been loaned to Jas. S. Hine, G. C. Crampton 

 and W. T. Davis. 



\'ertebrate Fossils. 



The collections of vertebrate fossils have been removed to the new 

 series of ca.'^es provided for them last year. The main collections 

 are arranged in trays in the storage closets under the cases, while a 

 representative .'series has been selected from them for exhibition. 

 The mammals and birds have been arranged by Mr. Kehn, the 

 reptiles and fishes by Mr. Fowler. Mr. Rehn has also comjiiled 

 exten.sive data from which comprehensive labels will be prepared, 

 desfribinc the exhibition for the benefit of the public. 



Invertebrate Fossils. 

 AcceR.«<ion.s to this department have not been large during the past 

 year. Dr. Pilsbry and the late Prof. Amos P. Brown have published 




1917.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 351 



a paper describing a small, but valuable lot of fossils from Colombia, 

 given by Mr. Lloyd B. Smith. A preliminary report on Santo 

 Domingo fossils by Dr. Pilsbry and Mr. C. W. Johnson, has also 

 been published. 



Herb.^rium. 



Mr. .•^tcwardsun Brown, who has been able to again take active 

 control of the herbarium, spending every other day at the Museum, 

 reports much progress in the work in this department. 



During the year Miss Ada Allen has mounteil 3.388 sheets of 

 plants, which have been catalogued and ilistributed in the general 

 herbarium l)y Mr. Brown, while Mr. S. S. Van Pelt, who has con- 

 tinued his voluntary .services during the year, has mounted 2,400 

 sheets for the local herbarium. 



Mr. Brown has studied and identified the collections made in 

 California by Dr. Witmer Stone, and in New Mexico by Dr. Henrj' 

 A. Pilsbry during 1915, and has also prepared for distrilnition to the 

 New York Botanical Garden, St. Ix>uis Botanical Garden, Gray 

 Herbarium and V . S. National Herbarium. 1,723 duplicate specimens, 

 in return for valuable accessions received from the.^e institutions. 



Mr. Van Pelt has rearranged nearly the entire Porter collection, 

 placing the specimens in systematic order so that they are readily 

 accessible, while he and Mr. Bayard Long have critically studied 

 certain families and separated out the local material, much of which 

 has been mounted. Mr. Long ha.s continued his voluntary care 

 of the local herbarium. 



Dr. J. C. Arthur and Mr. C. L. Shear spent a week in the study 

 of the de'^chweinitz cryptogamic herbarium and rearranged much 

 of it, giving the Academy the benefit of tiitir exjiert knowledge of 

 these obscure plants. 



Specimens have been loaned to I'rol. M. L. Fernald, W. W. 

 Eggleston, Francis J. Pennell, C. \. Pitxr. Mrs. Agnes Chase and 

 Prof. A. S. Hitchcock. 



Minerals and Rocks. 



Mr. Sanmel CJ. (Jordon, a student on the Je.s.«!up Fund, has con- 

 tinued to render excellent .'service in caring for the collections of 

 minerals and rocks. During the year he ha.s thoroughly clean.«:ed 

 and relabeled the collection of minerals depo.sited by the Franklin 

 Institute and arranged them in the new ca.ses in the mineral hall, 

 part of them Iteinc: placed on exhibition and the others in the study

collection. A number of small collections aggregating 6,000 speci- 

 mens which have lieen stored in the basement were critically exam- 

 ined, specimens of value placed in the general series and the others 

 packed away for disposal as duplicates. 



On several field trips to northern New Jersey, Virginia, etc., Mr. 

 Gordon secured a number of valuable rocks and minerals for the 

 collection. 



The arrangement of the William S. Vaux collection has been com- 

 pleted, and Mr. George M. Greene was employed to prepare new 

 labels for the entire collection. This work was completed early 

 in the year. Further labeling of groups, etc., has l)een done l)y 

 Mr. Gordon. 



Archeology. 



Mr. Moore's field expedition during the first three months of 

 1916, made a re-investigation of aboriginal sites along the lower 

 Mis.si.s.sippi River and in northwest Florida and Southern Alabama. 

 The autumn expedition was devoted to the region of northwest 

 Florida and southwest Georgia. The results of both expeditions 

 being largely pottery, regarded as duplicate, proved the thorough- 

 ness of his earlier investigations. The collections of archipological 

 material in the museum have been partly rearranged during the 

 year, l)y Miss H. N. Wardle, who has continucnl to care for the 

 department and many specimens have been identified for visitors 

 and correspondents. 



A number of loral eollectors have consulted the collections during 

 the year.
