From Professor Owen, of London, dated Nov. 11, 1845, 

 in reference to the fossil genus Dorudon, of Dr. R. W. Gibbes, 

 published in the Academy's Proceedings. He considers this 

 genus to be the same as the Zeuglodon, (Basilosaurus of 

 Harlan,) to which genus also belongs the very extensive 

 series of bones recently brought from Alabama by Dr. Koch, 

 and now exhibiting in this city. 



Mr. Haldeman offered some remarks on the specimen of

Unio crassus prosentC'<I by liini tliis evening, and stated that 

 it is one of tliosc which lie placed in the river Susfiuelmnna, 

 in a living state, in the year 1841, a record of -which fact ■will 

 be found at page 104, Vol. 1, of the Proceedings of the Aca- 

 demy. As no "western species of Unio, except U. viridis, 

 Raf., had hitherto been found in that river, Mr. Ilaldeman 

 had no doubt tliat the present specimen was in reality one of 

 those referred to. The growth had been inconsiderable, and 

 the general appearance very little changed. The other indi- 

 viduals of this and other species seem not to have survived.

DONATIONS TO LIBRARY. 



Eleventh and Twelfth Memoirs with reference to the law of 

 Storms in India, &c. By Henry Piddington. Calcutta, 

 1845. From the Author. 



A letter was read from Mr. Piddington, dated Calcutta, 

 September 8, 1845, accompanying the donation of his Me- 

 moirs above announced, and calling the attention of the So- 

 ciety to the Postscript to the 11th Memoir, page 64, " where 

 a curious experiment will be found detailed, which sets the 

 whole question of circular or converging winds (winds blow- 

 ing towards a centre) completely at rest, for these seas at 

 least." 



A letter was read from Benjamin Silliman, Jr., dated New 

 Haven, February 6, 1846, requesting on behalf of M. Alcide 

 D'Orbigny, of Paris, exchanges between him and the Aca- 

 demy, both of books and specimens of Natural History, and 

 suggesting especially the transmission of the publications of 

 this Society for such of M. D'Orbigny's works as may be de- 

 sirable for its Library. 




Feb., ]846.] 1*^ 



Professor Johnson then read to the Society the portion of 

 Mr. Piddington's Memoir referred to in his letter, and added 

 some remarks in confirmation of the correctness of the views 

 of the author on the subject. 



Dr. Morton announced that he had recently received letters 

 from Mr. I. G. Strain, U. S. N., a Correspondent of this 

 Institution, dated from the China seas, detailing the causes of 

 failure of his late expedition into the interior of Brazil. Mr. 

 S. was on his return home, and expressed an ardent hope of 

 being enabled to make a renewed effort to accomplish the 

 objects of his undertaking. 



On motion of Mr. Phillips, Resolved, That the Geological 

 Committee be authorised to put up a collection of the dupli- 

 cate fossils, to be forwarded to M. D'Orbigny.

 ington, dated February t), 184G, returning acknowledgments 

 for his election as a Correspondent. 



From Jacob Tremper, Es((., dated Dresden, New York, 

 February 9, 184G, calling the attention of the Society to the 

 advantages and importance of the adoption by scicntifiic bodies 

 throughout the Uuitcd States, of some general rules for keep- 

 ing meteorological registers for comparison, &c. 



From the American Academy of Arts and Sciences of 

 Boston, dated February 8, 1846, communicating a copy of a 

 letter addressed by a committee of that Society to the Joint 

 Library Committee of Congress, desiring the publication of a 

 larger edition of the Scientific Reports of the late U. S. Ex- 

 ploring Expedition, and soliciting the co-operation of this 

 Institution in the matter. 



The copy of the letter referred to was read also by the 

 Corresponding Secretary. 



Professor Johnson offered the following Resolutions, which 

 where adopted, and copies ordered to be transmitted to the 

 American Academy at Boston, and to the Library Committee 

 of Congress. 



Resolved, That the memorial of the American Academy of 

 Arts and Sciences of Boston, to the Joint Library Committee of 

 Congress, asking for the publication of a larger number of copies 

 of the scientific volumes containing the results of the late South 

 Sea Exploring Expedition, meets the cordial approval and con- 

 currence of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. 



Resolved, That in the view of this Academy, the present num- 

 ber of 100 copies only, printed on public account, is utterly in- 

 adequate to supply the demand for this work, especially as about 

 one-half of that number is understood to be distributed in dona- 

 tions to Foreign Governments, while none are allowed to Scien- 

 tific Societies at home. 



Resolved, That while the results of other American Exploring

Expeditions, and of other scientific labors, performed in obedience 

 to the requirements of Grovernment, have, by a just and liberal 

 policy, been made widely known to the public, the present course 

 oi j^^'^^tinff 100 copies only of the labors of the South Sea Expe- 

 dition, and which, therefore, scarcely deserves the name of a 

 publication, does equal injustice to the nation which has borne 

 the expense, and to the meritorious individuals who have per- 

 formed the scientific duties 



Resolced, That this Academy having, by special request of the 

 Xavy Department, afforded its aid and counsel in the preparation 

 of the Expedition, deems itself justified in complaining of the 

 treatment which, in common with all the other scientific bodies 

 then consulted, it receives by the existing arrangement, — that of 

 being compelled either to forego the possession of the works in 

 question, or to pay such a price as private speculation may afiSx 

 to public documents prepared by public oflBcers, and the entire 

 expense of which (with an exception too insignificant to mention) 

 has been defrayed out of the public treasury.

Descriptions of Netv Species of Fossil and Recent Shells and Corals. 



By T. A. Conrad. 



TERTIARY FOSSIL SHELLS. 



Cerithium ? 



Cerithiwn? ccelata. Plate 1, fig. 19. Turrited, whorls with four revolv- 

 ing ribs on each, the superior pair large, elevated, and obliquely crenate ; 

 the lower pair small, approximate, inferior one very near the suture; lines 

 of growth profoundly undulated. 



Locality. Island of Huaffo, near Cape Horn. In Tertiary clay. Dr. 

 James Eight?. 



This remarkable shell is imperfect in the last volution, and it is uncertain 

 whether it should be referred to Turritella or Cerithium. The rib in the 




20 [Feb., 1846. 



middle of the whorls is largest, and the crenae have a diffi.rent directioo 

 from those in the superior rib. A variety occurs with only three ribs, one 

 of the inferior pair being wanting 



Tklli.va. 



Tkllina Iluaffoensis. Plate 1, fig. 20. Subtriangular ; right valve vcntri- 

 cose ; anterior side subcuneiform ; margin obliquely truncated, extremity 

 rounded ; beaks medial ; posterior margin regularly rounded ; basal margin 

 nearly straight in the middle ; surface without other lines than those of 

 growth. 



Locality. Occurs with the preceding. 



These two fossils are imbedded in drab colored clay, the geological age 

 of which is uncertain. I have no doubt, however, that it is posterioi to the 

 Eocene period. 



MIOCENE SPECIES. 



EULIMA. 



EuLiMA eborea. Plate 1, fig. 21. Subulate, whorls 9 ; suture slightly de- 

 fined ; aperture somewhat oblique, ovate-acute. 



Locality. SufTolk, Virginia. 



E. migrans. Plate 1, fig. 22. Subulate, verj- narrow or slender ; suture 

 indistinct ; aperture direct, oblong-ovate, acute. 



Locality. Occurs with the preceding. 



Odostomia. 



Odostomia limnia. Plate 1, fig. 4. Subfusiform, polished, whorls 4; con- 

 vex ; suture impressed ; aperture oblong-ovate, half the length of the shell : 

 columella slightly folded. 



Locality. Yorktowu, Virginia. 



0. protexta. Plate 1, fig. 5. Subulate, minutely cancellated, with five 

 volutions, those of the spire being subangulated near the base; labrum sub- 

 angulated above the middle ; columella with a prominent fold in the 

 middle. 



Locality. Yorktown, Virginia. 



Delphinula. 



Delphinula arenosa. Discoidal, whorls 3, slightly convex ; minutely 

 striated longitudinally ; base regularly convex : umbilicus profound. Dia- 

 meter ^ of an inch.

 middle; labium rounded or ventricose; margin of labrum straight above; 

 base minutely umbilicated. 



Locality. Calvert Cliffs, Maryland.

CALYPTR^A. 



Subgenus Dispot(ea, Say. 



All the species of this genus found in the United States belongs to Say's 

 genus Dispotoea, which forms a very natural and distinct group, if the cha- 

 racters of the shells are any criterion of generic distinction. The following 

 list of species occur in the Miocene strata of the Union : 



C. (Dispotoea) corrugata, Brod. ^ Recent on the coast of Central Ame- 

 D. ramosa, Con. j rica, and fossil in Virginia. 



C. (Dispotoea) costata, Say, ^ Recent ; coast of Central Hmerica. 

 C. rugosa, Brod. j Fossil in Maryland. 



C. (Dispotcsa) multilineata, Con. Fossil. Wilmington, North Carolina. 



C. (Dispotoea) dumosa, Con. " »' " 



Trochus.

Myodora. 

 Myodora arenosa, Con. (^Pandora arenoso, Con.) Foss. Shells of Tert. 

 Form., p. 4, pi. 1, fig. 3. 



Eocene species. 

 Ampullaria ? 



AmpuUaria? perovata. V\ai,e 1, fig. 16. Ovate, body whorl ventricose ; 

 spire conoidal? aperture subovate, half the length of the shell. 



Locality. Claiborne. 



I possess but one imperfect specimen of this shell. It is rather elevated 

 for an Ampullaria ; but to this genus or to Paludina, the form of the aper- 

 ture more nearly allies it, than to any marine genus which is known to me. 



Caricella. 



Shell pyriform, with ribs or spines : spire short, apex thickened or papil- 

 lated ; beak somewhat produced and slightly curved, pointed, not emarginate 

 at base ; columella with four or five oblique, prominent, compressed plaits, 

 decreasing in size towards the base, as in Mitra. 



In my publication entitled " Fossil Shells of the Tertiary Formations,' 

 I propose the above name for a group of Claiborne shells, and re- 

 ferred it as a subgenus Turbinella, but the characters are sufiiciently dis- 

 tinctive to constitute a genus. The want of an emarginate base widely 

 separates it from Mitra ov Voluta. The labrum is always simple, without 

 teeth, and thin. The following species may be designated: C. bolaris,

 curved towards the base, and with numerous elevated pustules, most of 

 which have a central perforation: 



Locality. State of Ohio, in Silurian limestone, Dr. Riley. 



The rays are visible on only a small portion of the specimen, the rest 

 being imbedded in compact gray limestone. 



EOCENE SPECIES. 

 Turbinolia. 

 Turbinolia elaborata. Plate 1, fig. 30. Subcuneiform ; base acute, in- 

 curved, lamellae thin, numerous, branched, smooth becoming very irregular 

 or sinuous where they approach the centre; sides profoundly sulcated or 

 ribbed, the ribs densely and distinctly porous, many of them divaricated, 

 the intervals with remote transverse lamellse. 

 Locality. Near City Point, Virginia. 



T. pileohis. Plate 1, fig. 2G. Vide Proceed. A. N. S., vol. 1, p. 327. 

 Madrepoba. 



Madrepora vcrmiciilosa. Ramose, branches cylindrical ; cells remote, un- 

 equal, a little prominent, interstices with thick, equal, vermicular striae, 

 minutely granulated. 



Locality. Occurs with the preceding. 



This is a rare species ; the undating striae are large and ornamental.

 collection it belongs. 



31. clevata. Plate 1, fig. 31. Obliquely oval, somewhat ventricose, ribs 

 about 42 in number, prominent, acutely rounded, interstices very narrow,

 Norwood, M. D., of Madison, Indiana, dated Feb. 25, 1846, 

 desiring the communication to the Academy of an accompany- 

 ing printed description and figures of a new fossil fish from 

 the Palsezoic rocks of Indiana, by Drs. Norwood and D. D. 

 Owen, for which they propose the name Macropetalichthys 

 rapheidolahis. 



" This is (as far as is known to the describers) not only the 

 first instance of finding scutcheoncd fishes in this country, 

 but also the lowest position in which remains of vertebratje 

 have been found, if we except defensive fin bones, which 

 occur in New York, nearly in the same geological position, — 

 viz : in the corniferous group — and the scales of fishes, 

 which the Professors Rogers traced throughout the Clinton 

 frroup of Pennsylvania and Virginia."

 intention to further the objects of the Academy. 



Dr. Morton offered some observations (intended for publi- 

 cation in the American Journal of Science) on the Ethno- 

 graphy and Archaeology of the Aboriginal race of America. 



Dr. Morton called attention to the cretaceous fossils pre- 

 sented this evening ])y Mr. Lewis Germain, and especially to 

 the numerous fine fragments of Ammonites Delawarensis, of 

 which only a single specimen had hitherto been discovered in 

 the cretaceous beds of New Jersey or Delaware. Even that 

 specimen had been lost or mislaid, and there remained no 

 voucher for the species, excepting an uncertain fragment from 

 Alabama, which is now identified with the A. Delawarensis, 

 by means of Mr. Germain's collection. 



The iScaphites Cuvieri is more perfect than any other hitherto 

 found, excepting only the specimen in Mr. Conrad's cabinet, 

 and which is figured in Dr. Morton's synopsis of organic re- 

 mains. 



The Baculites ovatus of Say, heretofore a very rare species, 

 is here represented by nearly twenty finely characterised 

 specimens. The Nautilus Dekayi is also almost perfect ; and 

 the Ammonites placenta, Pholadomya occidentalis, Pecten 

 (^uinquecostatus, a Strombus, Turritella, and various other 

 genera, are found in this remarkable series, which was 

 obtained from a single marl excavation, about five miles east 

 of Bui'lington, in Ncav Jersey.

diflfering essentially from the " Agelacrinites" (Asteriacrinites) 

 of the New York reports, which is also found here, attached, 

 almost always, to a Strophomena or some other large shell, but 

 rather rare. This last it will be recollected, has five rays ex- 

 tended on an acicular disk, reaching even beyond the rays. The 

 specimen from which this drawing has been made, is so far as I 

 know, the only one which has been found here ; it is therefore 

 rare. Whether it be identical with an Asterias described by Dr- 

 Troost as occurring in the rocks of Tennessee, I cannot say, as I 

 have never seen his account.

 ty, I believe, for calling this limestone the carboniferous, and in 

 a paper read before our geological Association, I maintained the 

 .same views chiefly from Ldholinjifdl characters. The more ac- 

 curate test by the fossil remains, I am convinced determines our 

 limestone to be the equivalent of the Lower Silurian. With this 

 view it is interesting to find the Asterias at so low a point in the 

 geological column ; as it was formerly supposed not to extend 

 below evcu the secondary rocks."

While on a passage along the coast of Florida in the spring of 

 18-44, in the U. S. Revenue Cutter Nautilus, Capt. Waldron, 

 having on board Mr. Stacy, U. States Commissioner for the in- 

 !>pection of the Lighthouses, we stopped on the 28th of April to 

 examine at Key Biscayne, the ruins of the lighthouse burnt by 

 the Indians in 1836. The next day we took the boats with kegs 

 to procure water for the vessel ; passed inside of Cape Florida, 

 and ascended the Miami Elver about five miles to where it issues 

 from the Everglades. I was surprised to find that the water 

 from the everglades falls into the river over an exceedingly 

 porous limestone rock resembling Travertine, so open, that in nu- 

 merous places at the foot of the rapids, which are about two 

 hundred yards in length, the water spouts up from the small 

 round holes in the rock, in little natural fountains of from one foot 

 to eighteen inches in height. I estimated the fall at from seven 

 to eight feet; which cannot be far from the truth, as there is a mill 

 ut their foot for grinding the Coontic root, {Zamia integrifolia, 




April, 1846.] 35 



from which the Florida arrow root is made,) having a dam six feet 

 high,with a fall in the tail-race to high water in the river, of not less 

 than 18 inches. There had been a severe drought of five months, 

 and the bed of the everglades was quite dry, with the exception of 

 the brook running over the rapids, which, as far up as I explored it, 

 lay upon the travertine rock, at about eighteen inches below the 

 level bed of the everglades of hard sand, and covered with a strong 

 wiry grass from two to three feet high. This fact of the fall of the 

 waters of the everglades into the Atlantic, has, so far as I can as- 

 certain, hitherto remained unpublished ; nor have I been able to 

 learn that it was known to our officers during the war. Their op- 

 erations were principally on the Gulf side of the Peninsula, where 

 they entered and passed long distances into the everglades without 

 meeting with obstruction to the boat navigation. It appears to me 

 that, considered in connection with the great rapidity of the Grulf 

 stream in passing through the Straits of Florida, indicating a flow 

 from a higher level, this fall is a very strong link in the chain of 

 evidence which goes to prove that the sea is at a higher level on the 

 Western than on the Eastern coast of the peninsula of Florida.

 J. R. Ingersoll, Esq. 



Dr. Morton read the following extract of a letter addressed 

 to him by Prof. Bailey, of West Point. 



" I have lately hit upon some processes for revealing vege- 

 table structure in anthracite coal, which have yielded results 

 of unhoped for interest and beauty. I get, not mere traces 

 of parenchymatous tissue, as by Schultz's process, described 

 in Silliman's Journal, No. 1, new series, but I readily obtain 

 surfaces of several square inches, entirely covered over with 

 dotted or scalariform vessels, (bothrenchyma) in so perfect 

 a state, that their minute markings may be seen as easily as 

 upon the vessels of a recent plant. 



"I can prepare these, either as opake or transparent 

 objects, and all to whom I have shown them, including Tor- 

 rey, Gray, Prof. Henry and others, think them very beautiful. 



" A brief notice of these will appear in the forthcoming 

 number of Silliman's Journal." 



Dr. Morton offered some remarks upon the additional 

 fossils from Burlington Co., N. J., presented this evening by 

 Mr. Lewis Germain. Among the most remarkable are three 

 Specimens of Clypeaster florealis, of which only a single im- 

 perfect specimen had hitherto been found, and which had 

 served the purpose of specific description. The series also 

 contains a fine specimen of the Trochus leprosus, not before 

 found north of the cretaceous beds of Alabama. The cha- 

 racteristic species, Pecten quinquecostatus, and Baculites 

 ovatus, are also among Mr. Germain's collections, together 

 with a very large and a small tooth, and two vertebrae of the 

 Mosasaurus Gocidentalis, in admirable preservation. 



Dr. Morton also made the following observations on the 

 Peruvian remains deposited by him this evening. 



These ten crania and two mummied bodies, were exhumed 

 from the Indian cemetery at Arica, under the direction of our 




40 [April, 1846. 



member, Mr. Wm. A. Foster, now reyident in Lima. " Tliis 

 cemetery," observes Mr. Foster, " lies on the face of a sand-hill, 

 sloping towards the sea. The extent of surface occupied by these 

 tombs, as far as we explored, I should say was five or six acres. 

 In many of the tombs three or four bodies were found clustered 

 together, always in the alttiiKj j^ondirr, and wrapped in three or 

 four thicknesses of cloth^ with a mat thrown over all." 



The most interesting circumstance connected with these heads 

 14 the fact that with two exceptions they present the artificial 

 form of horizontal elongation, though in very variable degrees. 

 The most casual notice will convince any one, that this conforma- 

 tion has been in part produced by compresses on the forehead, 

 and partly, as Dr. Goddard has suggested, by the use of simple 

 rotary bandages. Thus a double compress has been applied to 

 the forehead, one bearing on each side of the frontal suture of in- 

 fancy ; these have been kept in their places by a bandage brought 

 from the base of the occiput obliquely over the forehead ; while the 

 parietal bones have been depressed by carrying the same band- 

 age alternately over the top of the head, immediately behind the 

 coronal suture. 



Any person who is acquainted with the form and pliableness 

 of the infant head at or soon after birth, will rea*dily conceive how 

 effectually the above plan would operate in moulding the cranium 

 into the elongated or cylindrical form; for while it prevents the 

 anterior portion from rising, and the sides from expanding, it al- 

 lows the occipital region an entire freedom of growth ; and thus 

 without diminishing the volume of the brain, merely forces it into a 

 different, though unnatural direction, and preserves, at the same 

 time, the symmetry of the whole structure. 



The series of skulls presents, in a most satisfactory manner, 

 all the grades of this process ; leaving no longer a doubt as to the 

 precise means by which it has been accomplished.

On ike Fossil SqualidcB of the Untied States. 

 By Robert W. Gibbes, M. D., of Columbia, South Carolina. 



Upon a careful comparison of the descriptions and plates of the admirable 

 •work of Agaseiz, "&ir les Poissons FossUes," belonging to the Library of 

 the South Carolina College, I have identified in my collection a large num- 

 ber of the teeth of Squalides. I have three which I cannot refer to any of 

 his species, and therefore consider them probably new. 



1. Charcharodon megalodon, Agassiz. Eocene, S. C. 



Agassiz refers this to the Miocene, as Lord Eaniskillen has a specimen 

 from the "molasse" of Switzerland, and Mr. Charlesworth notices it from 

 " the crag" of England. My finest specimen measures six inches in length, 

 and five across the root. 



2. Charcharodon rectidevs, Agassiz. Post Pliocene, S. C, from Eocene. 

 This measures five inches in length, and four and a quarter inches across 



the base of the root. It was sent to me as found in an excavation on the 

 suburbs of Charleston, for the foundation of a building at the rail road depot. 

 Beds of Post Pliocene underlie that city, and among the shells of that forma- 

 tion these teeth (two) were found. If no mistake occurred, (as my friend 

 had them twelve vears,) and they were actually found here, they were pro- 

 bably washed down from the Eocene marl, which is only a few miles off. 

 A, fine C. megalodon was found in the harbor of Charleston, and occasionally 

 other Eocene and Miocene remains are found on the beaches close by. 



I have classed it with my Eocene specimens, as Agassiz, from a specimen 

 in the " Museum d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris," has referred it to this 

 period. He saya : "La nature des fragmens attaches a 1' os basilaire d' un*

By William Gambel. 



AGCIPITRES. 



Cathartes Californianus, Shaw. Californian Vulture. 



This immense and interesting bird, rivalling the condor in size, al con- 

 fined exclusively to the Pacific coast, is particularly abundant in Cafornia 

 during winter ; when they probably come from Oregon, as they are lid to 

 disappear from the region of the Columbia at that time. 



It is not always so shy and difficult of approach, as has been repor ;t, and 

 like the Turkey buzzard, it is most so when solitary, but often venture to the 

 neighbourhood of the towns without much fear of man.* 



It is very voracious, and nothing less than the carcase of ahorse or c\y can 

 make a meal for many of them ; but such food is abundant, at least in le fall 

 of the year, where the dry pasturage has been destroyed by fire, acciditally 

 orintentionally, by the Indians. These fires extend over large tracts onoun- 

 try, and in consequence many cattle perish, as well as from the Eiimer 

 drought. 



It is not uncommon to see them assemble with the gulls, and gndily 

 devour the carcase of a whale which had been cast ashore ; they wi also 

 frequently pursue wounded game. 



The male in perfect plumage has the skin of the head and neck omge- 

 yellow, and the irides carmine. 

 Cathartes aura, Linn. Turkey Vulture. 



The Turkey buzzard is quite as abundant and familiar in Californias it 

 is in the southern parts of the United States. It is seldom molested, a ac- 

 count of its usefulness in ridding the neighbourhood of the towns andarm 

 houses of the refuse of the cattle, which are slaughtered in great numbs. 



*I may mention here an instance of the great disposition in the Vulms to 

 become domesticated, and to show how much they differ in character om 

 the other Accipitres with which they are classified. A Condor, which iaw 

 in Valparaiso, Chili, during the early part of last year, was allowed to )am 

 the city at large, and from its remarkable docility received kind treacent 

 from every one. It would follow and walk alongside of a person like dog, 

 for a considerable distance, and offer no resistance to being handled orave 

 its feathers or wings smoothed down. It would ascend a long hill leadix to 

 a part of the city where the foreigners resided, and when tired of the ]ice, 

 or after having obtained all it could procure to eat, it would spread its^rge 

 wings and soar down to the city, alighting perhaps on a steeple or iher 

 lofty point. It would receive the caresses of children, and permit the. to 

 beat it with switches, or even to attempt to get upon its back. It was nd 

 of thrusting its bill into my pocket, and under the straps of my pantaUns, 

 at the same time shutting its eyes and allowing me to rub and scratc its 

 head. In fact, I think that I have never met with any bird which exhiited 

 more tameness or greater confidence in man than this large and remarkale 

 Condor. I was informed that several other similar instances had been kc^irn 

 there.

 the city at large, and from its remarkable docility received kind treatment 

 from every one. It would follow and walk alongside of a person like a dog, 

 for a considerable distance, and offer no resistance to being handled or have 

 its feathers or wings smoothed down. It would ascend a long hill leading to 

 a part of the city where the foreigners resided, and when tired of the place, 

 or after having obtained all it could procure to eat, it would spread its large 

 wings and soar down to the city, alighting perhaps on a steeple or other 

 lofty point. It would receive the caresses of children, and permit them to 

 beat it with switches, or even to attempt to get upon its back. It was fond 

 of thrusting its bill into my pocket, and under the straps of my pantaloons, 

 at the same time shutting its eyes and allowing me to rub and scratch its 

 head. In fact, I think that I have never met with any bird which exhibited 

 more tameness or greater confidence in man than this large and remarkable 

 Condor. I was informed that several other similar instances had been known 

 there. 




April, 1846.] 45 



The Carrion Crow (C atratus, Wils.) is very common about the Gulf of 

 California, and at Mazatlan, particularly, may be seen around th.e town in 

 large gangs. In company with them I think I have also seen that new and 

 perfectly distinct species detected in the collection of the Academy, and 

 described by my friend Mr. Cassin.* Probably both may be found in 

 Upper California. 

 Ualiatus hucocephalus, Linn. Bald Eagle. 



Abundant ; in winter feeding on the ducks and geese which cover the 

 plains in immense flocks. 



I have found the nest on high isolated rocks along the coast, containing.' 

 eggs as early as the middle of February. 



An interesting circumstance connected with this noble eagle, as the em- 

 blem of our country, is, that it was held sacred by the native tribes of Indians 

 of the coast and interior of California, as I have frequently been informed. 



Another large brown Eagle, the Aguila rial, (probably the bird of Wash- 

 ington,) is said by the Indians and others to be occasionally observed here. 

 Patidion CaroUnensis, Gmel. Fish Hawk. 



Common along the coast, particularly the rocky islands, where they 

 breed. At Santa Catalina I found them nesting on the precipitous cliflFs, 

 in February, along with the bald eagles. 

 Butaetes Sancti Johannis, Gmel. Rough-legged Buzzard. 



Common in the prairie-valleys during winter, keeping much on the 

 ground. The adult in his dark livery, although frequently seen, is much 

 less common than the young. 

 Buteo borealis, Gmel. Red-tailed Buzzatd. 

 Very abundant; as also in the interior in the ranges of the Rocky mountains. 

 Buteo lineatus, Gmel. Red-shouldered Buzzard. 



The shrill kee ou of this handsome species may be heard at all times 

 around the vineyards and farms of the lower portions of Upper California, 

 where it is more abundant than about Monterey. 

 Bnteo Swainsoni, Bonap. Rocky Mountain Buzzard. 

 Buteo montana, Nutt. Man., p. 112, 2d ed. 

 B. vulgaris, Aud., pi. 372, et auc. 



This species was first brought from the fur countries by Richardson, who 

 considered it identical with the European Buteo vulgaris. 



Bonaparte in his comparative list of the birds of Europe and America, dis- 

 tinguishes it by the specific name of Swaiyisoni, quoting Audubon's descrip- 

 tion and plate of the specimen brought from Oregon by Townsend. 



My friend Nuttall retains the common buzzard as an inhabitant of the fur 

 countries, on the authority of Richardson, and refers Bonaparte's synonym 

 to that species, describing this, which he considers sufficiently distinct, un- 

 der the name of White-throated Buzzard, Buteo montanus. 



Richardson describes the nest as containing from three to five eggs, equal 



*Cathartes Bitrrovianus, Cussin, Proc. Acad. Nat, Sciences, vol. 2, p. 212.

in size to those of the common fowl, and of a grocnidU wliito colour, with 

 a few (lark brown blotches at the thick end. Townsend, who Ijrought it 

 from the Rocky mountains, found it breeding there in July, the nest con- 

 taining two white eggs. 



A. L. Heermann, M.D., during a recent trip to the prairies, found this 

 ^pecies breeding near the Platte River, and also procured the eggs, of which 

 he kindly furnished me with a drawing and description. It is considerably 

 smaller than that of the Eurojjean buzzard, and differs from it in being pure 

 white, with a few dark brown blotches on the smaller end, while the latter is 

 i)f a bluish or greenish tinge, with faded marks of a neutral tint, apparently 

 5unk into the shell, and scattering blotches of dark brown. The account 

 ^iven me of its nest by Dr. Heermann agrees so exactly with that of Rich- 

 ardson, that I have no doubt of its being the same bird. 

 Elanus leucurus, Bonap. White-tailed Elanus. 



This active, beautiful hawk, is not unfrequent in California. At the mission 

 of St. John, between Monterey and St. Francisco, I procured three specimens 

 in one day. It flies low and circling over the plains in the manner of a 

 marsh hawk, feeding on the small birds which are so abundant on the 

 i^round. It is easy of approach when perched on trees, and utters a very 

 loud shrill cry, particularly when wounded and caught, fighting viciously. 

 Falco anatum, Bonap. Peregrine Falcon. 



Occasionally seen along the coast, nesting on cliffs near the sea. 

 Falco Columbarius, Linn. Pidgeon Falcon. 

 Common throughout the Western coast. 

 Cercneis Spai-ve.rins, Linn. Sparrow Hawk. 



This familiar little species is abundant throughout the country. 

 Astur Fttscus, Gmel. Sharp-shinned hawk. 



Our pugnacious and daring little marauder appears to be distributed 

 over the whole of N. America. 

 Astur Cooperii, Bonap. Cooper's Hawk. 



The most remarkable similarity exists between the plumage of this spe- 

 cies and the former in every age ; and although the great difference in size 

 renders it impossible to mistake them, I think that if we depended upon 

 the plumage alone, no sufficiently distinguishing marks could be given. 

 We find, in fact, in every department of natural science, that those cha- 

 racters, which in one genus or family can be relied upon as showing 

 specific differences, are, in others, almost useless, or at best perplexing. 



This bird is common throughout the Pacific coast. 

 Strigiceps uliginosus, Gmel. Marsh Hawk. 



In low valleys or marshes throughout California, the Rocky mountains, 

 and New Mexico, we are sure to find this widely disseminated species. 

 Bubo Virginianus, Gmel. Great Homed, or Cat Owl. 

 Common in the wooded regions of Upper California. 




April, 1846.] 47 



Athene socialis, Nobis. Barrowiog Owl. 



Strix cunicularia, Bonap., Aud., Nutt. 



This bird, which hitherto has been considered the same throughout the 

 wide range of North and South America,may,I think, be separated on as good 

 grounds as many of the owls which are generally admitted to be distinct. It is 

 unnecessary to repeat here the excellent descriptions which have been given 

 by Bonaparte and Audubon of N. American specimens of the burrowing owl 

 I shall merely state wherein I think ours differs from the S.American species 



I conceive it to differ in the general colour, being lighter in our species. 

 with the markings and quills usually of a pale yellowish or cinnamon hue 

 while in the other the colour is always much deeper and approaching dusky. 



The most marked difference exists in the feet and legs, which are in ours 

 slender and delicate, while in the other they are longer and much stouter. 



The wings are shorter, and have the first and fifth quills equal, if any- 

 thing, the first longest : in the S. American the fifth quUI is considerably 

 longer than the first. 



The bill in ours is smaller in every way, and of a dusky horn colour, ex- 

 '•ept at the ridge and edges ; in the other it appears to be dusky only at the 

 base. 



But how can either of these agree with the description given of the Co- 

 iiuimbo owl, by Brisson, as being so much larger, with the tail of a dirty- 

 white colour and immaculate ? 



I have seen this bird in New and Old Mexico, on the Roeky mountains, 

 and in California ; in each place presenting little difference in its habits. It 

 always lives in burrows in the ground, either solitary, as I have frequently 

 seen it, or in small companies. If it can avail itself of the labours of other 

 animals, it will always do so, so that it is a constant interloper in the habi- 

 tations of the prairie dogs, and in California in those of the large ground 

 squirrel, which is there so very common. It however often digs for itself, 

 :ind lives in scattered companies of four or five. 



Xuttall is, I think, mistaken with regard to its migrating from California 

 in August. I have seen it there at all periods of the year. 



On the prairies its note is said to resemble that of Marmots, with which it 

 is associated. The account which Vieillot gives of its nocturnal habits and 

 note, has been doubted by Bonaparte and my friend Nuttall. During the 

 breeding season, while sleeping near their burrows, I have been awakened 

 by its low, measured and solemn cry, uttered much in the manner of its 

 congeners, but peculiarly solemn. 



Nyctale Acadica, Gmel. Little Night Owl. 



I procured but one specimen of this species at Monterey in October. 



Striz pratnicola, Bonap. Barn Owl. 



This delicate feathered and f^xmiliar fowl, which, hitherto, I believe has not 

 been known to exist west of the Atlantic coast, I found very abundantly in 

 California, and presenting all the habits ascribed to its European relative. Its 

 favorite resort is in the neighborhood of the towns and ruined Missions, al- 

 though it may be found also about farm houses, and occasionallyin the prairie 

 valleys, which furnish it with abundance of mice and other small animals fjor 




48 [April, 184r». 



subsistence. It makes its nest under the tiled roofsof the bouses of the town;:, 

 numbers under one roof, and shows but little fear when approached. I have 

 scarcely ever visited a mission without disturbing some of these birds, which 

 were roosting about the altar, cliandelier, &c., of the chapel, and hearing 

 the bendition of the Padre for drinking all the oil out of the lamps. Ever.v 

 where iu Culifornia, when speaking of it, we arc sure to be told of its pro- 

 pensity for drinking the sacred oil ; with what truth I cannot say. 



The specimeus which I have examined agree in every respect with those 

 from this side of the continent, and present the constant characters given 

 by Audubon to distinguish it from the European species.

Descriptions of Tioo Neio Species of Fossil EcTiinodermata, from 

 the Eocene of the United States. 



By Samuel Gteorge Morton, M. D. 

 Genus Cidaris. 

 C. Alahamensis. Compressed, pentagonal, the angles rounded 

 so as to form a ten-sided figure. Tea rows of tubercles, with 

 nine or ten in each row. Ambulacra arranged in five pairs, 

 with delicate, slightly oblique fissures separated by a double ele- 

 vated line. Surface between the tubercles and ambulacra finely 

 granulated. 



Genus Galerites. 



G. f Agassii. Elevated, hemispherical, with four pairs of am. 

 bulacra which diverge from the apex and meet at the margin, 

 having each two rows of pores connected by transverse fissures. 

 Surface marked by numerous, distinct granulations, which are 

 continued over the whole base of the fossil. 



I have much pleasure in dedicating this remarkable species to 

 M. Louis Agassiz, whose profound researches into this class of 

 organized beings have thrown much new light on their structure, 

 aflBnities and geological relations. 



Both these fossils were found by Dr. Albert Koch, in the Eocene

 the tip. This insect, on account of its very frequent occurrence, has been 

 doubtless already described. I should not hesitate to consider the H. cisteloides 

 of Germar identical with the present species, if that accurate entomologist had 

 not stated that the thorax of cisteloides was "postice pauUoangustior," which 

 is not the case in ,our species, but in numerous specimens before me the 

 thorax is in every instance postice paullo latior.

 By John S. Phillips. 



Physa princeps. Testa elongata conica, luteo vol griseo cornea, 

 nitida, lineis albis interruptis longitudinalibus picta ; anfractibus 

 5 — 6-subconvexis ; suturis appressis distinctis ; apice acuto ;

This beautiful Physa was brought from Yucatan, Central 

 America, by my friend Mr. Norman, the enterprising traveller 

 and author of " Rambles in Yucatan," &c. 



Among other species brought by Mr. Norman from Yucatan, 

 were some specimens of a Glandina, of which I have found no 

 description that would at all apply, except that of G. obtusa, Pfeif., 

 from Nicaragua, (Proceedings of the Lend. Zool. Soc, 1845.) 




May, 1846.] 6T 



If this species from Yucatan be the G. obtusa, Dr. Pfeiffer has 

 described a young shell, the dimensions of the Nicaragua shell 

 being, length 9J lines, diameter 5 lines ; last whorl rather longer 

 than spire of the Yucatan shell ; d. 14 lines ; diameter 5 J lines ; 

 aperture 5^ lines. The character of the surface in G. obtusa is 

 not noticed. The specimens from Yucatan are minutely striated 

 longitudinally,the stride the strongest near the sutures and becoming 

 weaker towards the apertui'e ; these striae are crossed by very 

 minute revolving lines, giving the shell under a good glass a 

 slightly granular aspect. The G. obtusa is described as " ovata 

 utrinque attenuata;" these adult shells have the two last whorls 

 almost cylindrical. 



See plate 1, fig. 33, in No. 1. 



Should it prove to be distinct from the Nicaragua species, I 

 would propose the name of 



Crlandina (Achatina) cylmdracea. Testa sub-cylindracea, apice 

 obtusa, solidula, pellucida, pallidissime carnea, longitudinaliter 

 tenue striata, striis decussatis lineis exilissimis, anfractibus 7, vix

/if mat k.^ ujion the Anntomy of the Alxlominal Viscera of the Sloth, liradi/pus 

 tridartyliis, Linn. 



By Joseph Leidv, M. D. 



A living specimen of the three-toed sliAh, which was lately brought to this 

 city from South America, having died a short time sine, I have been enabled, 

 through the kindness of Mr. Wood, preparer of specimens in natural history, 

 to procure the greater part of the abdominal viscera and the uterus. 



Descriptions of the anatomy of this animal have been given by several authors, 

 but unfortunately not without a great deal of discrepancy in the statement of 

 the simplest matters of fact, which I cannot account for in any other way than 

 by suspecting several species to have been indiscriminately described as the 

 same. Such cases of discrepancy are by no means unfrequent in Zootomy, 

 arising, no doubt, in many cases, from the too exclusive attention in the 

 preparation and preservation of the exterior, to the careless examination, or 

 even total neglect of the interior. 



Regretting exceedingly that I have not been able to extend my observations 

 to the whole anatomy of the animal, I must be content to give a few cursory 

 remarks upon the material obtained, which I proceed to do at once. 



The stomach, according to Cuvier, in his Regne Animal, Tome I. p. 217, 

 "is divided into four sacks analogous enough to the four stomachs of the 

 rumiuantia, but without folds or other salient parts in the interior."' Dr. 

 Harlan,* in his account of the anatomy of this animal, writes, "the stomach 

 consists of a large paunch, in no way furnished with compartments like that 

 of the ruminantia, as is asserted by Buflfon, who also errs in attributing 

 ruminating faculties to the animal ; but this organ presents a structure diflfering 

 from that of any other animal with which we are familiar, being furnished 

 with numerous, long, conical cul-desacs." 



The specimen of the stomach which I have investigated agrees with the 

 account, so far as it goes, of Cuvier. Taken as a whole, this organ is irregular 

 in shape, large, capacious, and sacculated. It is evidently divided into four 

 compartments, or distinct portions, by contractions, partitions, and difference 

 of structure. The first compartment is the largest and corresponds to the paunch 

 of the ruminantia; it is separated from the second compartment by a well marked 

 and prominent ridge, is lined by a soft mucous membrane, having in it nu- 

 merous follicles of a large size, is, comparatively with the other portions, thin in 

 its parietes, and has projecting upwards from it, possessing the same structure, 

 a ' ' long, conical cul-de-sac, ' ' the only one found in connection with the stomach 

 in this specimen. The second and third compartments are next in size, and 

 are separated from each other by a partition of the same structure projecting 

 from each side of the cavity of the organ. The cBsophagus opens into the 

 second compartment, but as it was cut oflf close to the stomach I am unable to 

 say anything about it. The lining mucous membrane of these two latter com- 

 partments presents a rigid, rqugh and thick epithelia, surface resembling in 



•Observations on the Anatomy of the Sloth, Bradypus tridactylus, Linn. Medical 



and Physical Researchei, p. .544. Philadelphia, 183o. 




June, 1846.] 73 



structure the cuticular lining of the gizzard of birds. A deep fold of the lining 

 and intermediate or muscular membrane passes from the left of the opening of 

 the oesophagus into the second compartment, transversely along the side of the 

 third compartment into the fourth, being somewhat analogous to the arrange- 

 ment in the ruminantia for conducting the ruminated food into the fourth 

 stomach. The fourth compartment is narrow and intestiniform ; the muscu- 

 lar tunic at its inferior half obtains a sudden increase, being extremely thick 

 and strong. The internal surface at the commencement presents a patch of 

 soft mucous membrane extending about two-thirds round the circumference of 

 the cavity, and about an inch in width, and is surrounded by an abrupt, thick- 

 ened, and papillated ridge of the epithelial structure, giving it somewhat the ap- 

 pearance of an excavated ulcer. The remaining part of the surface is formed 

 of the same epithelial structure as in the second and third compartments, but is 

 thicker, and is thrown into numerous transverse and longitudinal folds, and has 

 at its commencement several large and deep follicles, with mouths from one to 

 two lines in diameter. The pylorus is small, and presents no valvular arrange- 

 ment, but is capable of being perfectly closed by the agency of the very thick 

 muscular tunic and the approach of the internal longitudinal folds. 



The duodenum comes off from the stomach by a very abrupt thinning in 

 structure. Its lining mucous membrane is soft and villous, but has no valvulas 

 conniventes. The openings of the hepatic and pancreatic ducts into it are 

 about one inch apart. 



The other part of the small intestine is, comparatively, rather short, and 

 appears to be pretty uniform in diameter, although it has a gradual increase 

 downwards, being the reverse in this point in man and some other animals. 

 The muscular coat of the small intestine is rather thin; the mucous coat pre- 

 sents a structure like that 6f the duodenum. 



The distinction between the small intestine and colon is pretty well marked 

 but the latter does not extend beyond the former to a sufficient degree to form 

 a coecum. The commencement of the colon is about ten lines in diameter, but 

 decreases as it passes forwards or ascends, until at its anterior part, the diameter 

 is less than that of the small intestine ; it gradually increases again as it de- 

 scends, until it emerges in the extremely dilated rectum. It is not at all saccu- 

 lated, which appears to have been otherwise the case in Dr. Harlan's specimen.. 



The liver is formed of large acini, is very little lobulated, and has no gall 

 bladder. 



The pancreas and spleen present nothing of interest. 



The kidnies are small, and present internally but a single papilla renalis pro- 

 jecting into the pelvis of these organs. 



The uterus in this individual is in a pregnant condition, being probably 

 about four or six weeks advanced. Its size in this condition is a little more 

 than one half that of the unimpregnated adult human uterus, and is pyriform 

 in shape. The ovaries are about the size of a coffee-grain, and at one extremi- 

 ty are in contact with the uterus. The Fallopian tubes are correspondingly 

 short. In structure the uterus is fibro-muscular ; the cavity of the neck is 

 lined by a mucous membrane thrown into numerous longitudinal folds. The 

 cavity of the body contains a single embryo. The two portions of the mem. 

 brana decidua, the reflexa and vera, are combined, forming a thickness of five

[Jdne, 184G. 



or six lines, ami possesses a decided vascularity. The chorion is connected to 

 tlie decidua by its shaggy surface, but an amnion is not distinguishable, being 

 probably not yet formed. 



Passing from the sides of the cavity of the chorion, is a delicate cellular tissue, 

 filled with a transparent serous fluid, the corpus reticulare, in which the embryo 

 is suspended by the duct of the allantois and vessels to the upper part of the 

 chorion, at the point where the future placenta is formed. The embryo, in its 

 curved position, measures six lines in length, and exhibits the cerebrum, cere- 

 bellum, chorda dorsalis, the rudimentary vertebrae, ribs, and extremities, and 

 the heart, the liver, the stomach and urinary bladder. 



Conceiving the pregnant uterus at this stage to be of more than ordinary 

 interest, I present the following figures of the same as it appeared on dissection.

 The Committee on Dr. Leidy's paper on the Anatomy of 

 Spectrum femoratum. Say, rcportc<l in favor of publication. 



On the Anatovuj of Spectrum femoratum^ Say, 



By Joseph Leidt, M. D. 



Spectrum femoratum is one of those singular insects which from their 

 appearance, in localities where they are found, are commonly known under 

 the name of" Walking Sticks." 



This species was first described by the distinguished naturalist, formerly 

 in connection with our Society, Thomas Say, and a description and drawing 

 of it will be found in the third volume of his American Entomology. Indi- 

 Tidual specimens have been found in most parts of the United States, bat I 

 have not learned of any place where it is abundant, excepting in the State 

 of Iowa, from whence I obtained my specimens, through Dr. B. J. Kern, 

 who informs me they are found in considerable numbers, frequenting high 

 bluffs or dry exposed situations, creeping on the ground or on decaying 

 timber. 



It belongs to the order Orthoptera, family Mantidae. The male insect 

 measures 2 inches 9 lines in length, and one line in breadth ; the female, 

 3 inches, 7 lines in length, and 2 lines in breadth at the thorax, and 3J 

 lines at the abdomen. 



The head is oval; the eyes are somewhat protuberant. It has no sim- 

 ple eyes. The antennae, in the male, are about 2 inches in length ; in the 

 female, 1^ inches ; setaceous, and numerously jointed, the joints (Fig. 1.) 

 being long, oval and hirsute. 



The thorax has three segments, the two posterior of which form full one 

 third the length of the whole body. The smallest rudiment of wings does 

 not exist. The anterior and posterior pair of legs, in the male, are two 

 inches in length, the intermediate pair one and one-half inches ; in the 

 female they are all about half an inch shorter. They are narrow, and 

 much separated in the walking position. The thighs of the central 

 pair of legs in the male are comparatively thick and the thighs of the central 

 and posterior pairs, have at their distal extremity an acute projecting 

 spine, long in the male, short in the female. The tarsus (Fig. 2.) 

 is five jointed, each joint being furnished with siiflT haira and at the under 

 part of the distal extremity, a pair of hard, smooth, shining black tuber-

cles. The last joint is armed with two hooked phalanges having placed be- 

 neath them a round and thick soft pad. The abdomen has nine segments. 

 The last abdominal segment, in both sexes, is furnished with two short 

 caudal appendages. The external part of the sexual apparatus is articulated 

 with the ventral plate of the seventh abdominal segment. 



Of the digestive apparatus. The oral organs are mandibulate or masticatory. 

 The labium (Fig.3,) is in fourpieces,two of which are external and one longer 

 than the internal. They are somewhat claviculate in shape, have each a black 

 spot at the extremity and articulate with the mentum, properly a fifth piece 

 to the labium. The labial palpi (Fig. 3, a,) articulate with the mentum, are 

 hirsute, and three-jointed, two of the joints being oval and the third lanceo- 

 late in shape. The tongue, (Fig. 4,) which is internal as regards the mouth 

 and is generally considered to belong to the labium, is flat from side to side, 

 ot a curved triangular form, corneous in structure, and ciliate upon its upper 

 edge. 



The maxillae (Fig. 5,) are tridentate and slightly hairy. The maxillay palpi 

 (Fig. 5, a.) are five-jointed and hirsute ; the first two joints are subrotund, 

 the next two conical, and the last one lanceolate in form. The mandibulae 

 (Fig. 6,) are very hard, short, and strong, and present a triangular molar 

 surface, with two of the sides raised into trenchant, sharp edges, resembling 

 very much a gouge, and well adapted for cutting the harder vegetable sub- 

 stances. The labrum (Fig. 7,) is slightly convex and emarginated. The intes- 

 tinal canal (Fig. 8,) extends in a straight line, the length of the body, from 

 the mouth to the anus, and is broad and capacious throughout. The pharynx 

 is almost null. The oesophagus, at first narrow, after a few lines of its course 

 almost abruptly dilates into a tube of large calibre, extending nearly one half 

 the length of the whole canal, and may be considered in the light of a com- 

 bined crop and oesophagus, as it appears to be a receptacle of the food, in 

 which the latter undergoes some change preparatory to being received into 

 the stomach, and I will, hence, call it the oesophageal crop. (Fig. 8, a.) Its in- 

 ferior part (Fig. 9,) becomes contracted in shape like the neck of a Florence 

 flask, and projects into the cavity of the stomach. The orifice'opening into 

 the stomach is narrow, and has a valve-like appendage connected to its lip. 

 The exterior or muscular tunic of the oesophageal crop is thick and strong; 

 its transverse fibres are well marked. The epithelium is comparatively 

 thick and tightly adherent to its basement membrane. 



This portion of the alimentary canal I found to be full of coarse particles 

 of decaying wood, which I infer to be the food of the animal. 



The stomach (Fig. 8, b.) is about half an inch in length, and of very little 

 greater breadth than the preceding receptacle. Its parietes are compara- 

 tively thin, and present internally numerous transverse rugae which pass 

 from a longitudinal ruga in front to a corresponding one behind. The 

 muscular investment is very thin ; the epithelial surface is soft and readily 

 separable from the basement membrane, which latter makes up the greater 

 part of the thickness of the stomach. 



The duodenum (Fig. 8, c.) is only distinguishable from the stomach by a 

 narrowing of its capacity and the disappearance of the rugae. It presents 

 the same structure as the stomach. Its length is about three times thaf o 




82 July, 1846. 



the latter, aad it receives near ita middle, where it undergoes a narrow 

 contraction, the biliarj vessels. The contained mass of the Btomach and 

 duodenum has a pultaceous consistence. 



The ilium (Fig. 8, e.) is not more than four lines in length, is exceedingly 

 contracted, and opens directly into the rectum. 



The rectum (Fig. 8, f.) is about tlie same length as the ilium, is mode- 

 rately capacious, and has thick musculo-epithelial parietes. It presenti 

 internally several columns or longitudinal folds, which give a columnar 

 appearance to the excrement of the animal. The anus opens at the extre- 

 mity of the last abdominal segment between the caudal appendages. 



The salivary glands (Fig. 8, g.) two in number, are placed laterally upon 

 the anterior part of the oesophageal crop. In structure they are of the 

 highest order, being granulated or conglomerate, one of the rarest forms in 

 the economy of insect life. Their ducts open into the mouth. 



The biliary vessels (Fig. 8, h. Fig. 11,) are numerous, moderately long, 

 and form a double attachment to the duodenum. They are connected attheir 

 commencement to the external tunic of the duodenum just above the middle, 

 in three rows, (Fig. 10,) one below the other, from whence they pass down- 

 wards nearly to the termination of the duodenum, then doubling upon them- 

 selves, running forwards, they finally form the connection of entry about 

 the middle of the duodenum, at the contraction before mentioned, (Fig. 11.) 

 "When highly magnified, they present a structure of basement membrane 

 filled interiorly with organic nuclei and cells, (Fig. 12.) 



The Generative apparatus. — In the female : The ovaries (Fig. 8, i.) two in 

 number, are placed within the abdomen on each side of the duodenum, and 

 are about 18 lines in length. Each ovary consists of numerous ovigerous 

 tubes (Fig. 13, a.) 4 or 5 lines in length, which commence very narrow, gra- 

 dually dilate, and join a common tube, the oviduct. The ovigerous tube 

 contain ova in various stages of development, from a mere point at their 

 commencement to the fully formed ovum at their termination. The perfected 

 ova measure 1^ lines in length, are oval and smooth. The oviducts (Fig. 

 8, j, Fig. 13, b.) are narrower and pass backwards and join each other be- 

 neath the ileum to form a common canal, the vagina. The vagina (Fig. 

 13, c.) is 2\ lines long, its external orifice is placed between an oval ventral 

 plate (Fig. 13, d. Fig. 14, a.) articulating with the extremity of the ventral 

 plate of the sixth abdominal segment, and an upper convex plate provided 

 with four curved and pointed forceps, (Fig. 13, e.) articulating with the 

 seventh abdominal segment, which probably acts the part of an ovipositor. 



In the male, the genitalia are very simple. The testes (Fig. 15, a.) consiit 

 of a pair of comparatively thick and short tubes, forming each a single con- 

 Tolution, and joining each other beneath the ilium to form the ductus ejacu- 

 latorious (Fig. 15, b.) which proceeds to the penis. The penis (Fig. 15, c.) 

 is external to the body, and is placed below the eighth abdominal segment, 

 but articulates with the seventh. It is short, semi-oval in form, with a short 

 pointed process behind, ii enveloped by chitinous membrane, and is received 

 in a calx (Fig. 15, d.) formed of chitine, which articulates with a small con- 

 vex segment attached to the ventral plate of the seventh abdominal segment.

The Xervous system. — The cerebrum (Fig. 17, a.) placed above the oeso- 

 phagus, in form is like two pyriform bodies placed side by side, with the 

 apices anterior and divergent to the base of the antennae. From the most 

 anterior part of each lateral mass passes off the antennal nerve, (Fig. 17, b.) 

 and from the external side, just posterior to the latter, the optic nerve, (Fig. 

 17, c.) From the base of the optic nerve and the cerebrum immediately pos- 

 terior proceed two small branches, which unite to form a single cord, the 

 analogue of the sympathetic nerve (Fig. 1 7, d.) which passes backwards along 

 the side of the oesophageal crop, to which, after dividing into two principal 

 branches, it is ultimately distributed by numerous minute twigs. Antero-in- 

 feriorly the cerebrum sends off two branches which pass forwards, unite, and 

 form the frontal ganglion (Fig. 17, e.) from which proceeds backwards, be- 

 neath the cerebrum, a single cord running along the upper surface of the oeso- 

 phageal crop nearly to its termination. These two latter branches, the frontal 

 ganglion, and the single resulting cord, constitutes the nervus recurrens, or 

 nervus vagus, (Fig. 17, f.) The nervus vagus, after passing the cerebrum, 

 forms a small swelling, which gives off minute ramuscles to the salivary 

 glands and neighboring part of the oesophageal crop. It also forms a gang- 

 lion (Fig. 17, g.) of moderate size upon the lower part of the oesophageal 

 crop, from which proceed six principal nerves to be distributed to the oeso- 

 phageal crop and stomach. 



The ventral cord consists of a chain of eleven ganglia, connected in their 

 length by a double commissure. 



The first of this chain, the cerebellum, (Fig. 17, i.) is a cordiform gang- 

 lion situated beneath the commencement of the oesophagus, and connected 

 to the cerebrum by its appropriate commissures, gives off the mandibulary, 

 maxillary, and labial nerves. 



The three following ganglia are the thoracic ganglia, (Fig. 18, a.) the 

 first of which is simple, the two others double. These give off nerves both 

 to the extremities and to the neighboring parts. 



The seven remaining ganglia are the abdominal. (Fig. 18, b.) They are 

 all single and give off numerous minute ramuscles in their vicinity.

 America. 



By Edward Hallowell, M. D. 



The animal from which the following description was taken, died in one 

 of the menageries of Ehiladelphia of a tuberculous affection of t'le lungs. 

 It is remarkable for the great development of the lower extremities, which 

 are sufficiently powerful to enable it to carry off a goat with facility. It is 

 even stated that it has the power to carry off the dead body of a man, but 

 such accounts are evidently fabulous. It is said to be solitary and to feed 

 upon sloths and other small quadrupeds. 



VertebrcE. There are 13 cervical vertebra;. The bodies of the four first are 

 quite short; the seventh measures six and a half lines in depth upon its ante- 

 rior face; the transverse processes attached to the anterior extremities of these 

 vertebrae are well characterized, the longest being 4 lines in length; a small 

 tubercle exists at the base, at the inner margin of the process in the sixth, 

 seventh, eighth and ninth. Inferior spinous processes are observed in the first, 

 second, fourth and fifth, and from the eleventh to the last; the superior spinous 

 processes are well marked in the second, third, fourth and fifth, and iu the 

 tenth, eleventh twelfth and thirteenlh ; the superior spinous process of the 

 thirteenth is square, and resembles that of the first dorsal, except that its 

 breadth is not so great. There are inferior spinous processes to the five 

 first dorsal ; and there is a rudiment of one attached to the sixth ; those 

 attached to the third, fourth and fifth are the longest; the middle one 

 of these three is broader at its base than either of the others ; the inferior 

 spinous processes of the caudal vertebrae are five in number ; a complete 

 foramen for the transmission of an artery exists in each of the four pos- 

 terior ; in the first it is not observed ; the bony processes passing from 

 one transverse process to another are well defined, but there is no

anchylosis ; there are no spines or processes attached to the anterior face 

 of the lumbo-sacral bone ; a slight ridge exists near its posterior extremity; 

 the fourth and fifth transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae are more 

 developed than either of the others ; transverse processes are observed in 

 all but the two last ; the dorsal spinous process of the penultimate vertebra 

 is ■well characterized ; none of the caudal vertebr e are truly anchylosed ; 

 there are eight caudal vertebrae and nine dorsal ; the vertebrae present nu- 

 numerous foramina for the transmission of air ; the spinous processes of the 

 dorsal vertebrae are all separated ; none of their bodies are truly anchylosed. 

 The keel of the sternum is well developed ; there are no notches in the pos- 

 terior border ; near its extremity are two large foramina, eleven lines in 

 length, which extend to within two and a half lines of the posterior margin ; 

 the coracoid bones are remarkably strong and powerful, being greatly ex- 

 panded at their base ; the furcula is separated from the sternum a distance of 

 nearly half an inch. The scapula and clavicles present nothing remarkable 

 in their conformation ; there are eight ribs, two of which appear to be want- 

 ing, the pit8 for their reception being alone observed ; the six which exist are 

 attached to the sterno-costal bones ; there are caudal appendages to the 

 second, third, fourth and fifth; that of the second meets the anterior margin of 

 the fourth about its middle ; none of the ribs are anchylosed with the pelvis. 



Cranium. The foramen magnum is nearly horizontal ; two well marked de- 

 pressions exist upon the posterior and inferior aspect of the occipital bone ; 

 between them is a small ridge four lines in length ; it is very narrow, pre- 

 senting a marked contrast in this respect with the ridge in the same part 

 in the grey vulture of Africa which measures half an inch in breadth ; the 

 supraorbitar and lachrymal bones are of nearly equal length ; the former 

 is rounded at its posterior extremity where it presents a broad expansion, 

 the corresponding part of this bone in the grey African vulture terminates 

 in a point ; that part of the skull immediately above these depressions is 

 much flattened ; the ossa communicantia are seven lines in length and of 

 moderate thickness. The opening for the nostrils is four lines in breadth ; 

 the posterior extremity of the lower jaw does not project beyond the up- 

 per ; the cranium presents generally a smooth surface exteriorly. 



Anterior Extremities. The humerous is well developed. On its internal 

 aspect is a well marked ridge, presenting a broad and somewhat rough 

 surface, inclining backwards, beneath which is the hole for the transmis- 

 sion of air ; the humerus immediately below this is compressed laterally, 

 having a triangular form ; it is concave near its inferior extremity pos- 

 teriorly, and convex in front ; the middle of the bone is smooth and 

 rounded ; the inferior articulating surface presents two oblong convexities 

 for articulation with the bones of the forearm, with a narrow fossa be- 

 tween them ; there is but one carpal bone in the subject under examination, 

 but there is clearly a smooth articulating surface for another ; the radius is a 

 long and slender bone, having about one half the diameter of the ulna ; there 

 are two small ridges upon its distal extremity; the ulna has a well marked ole- 

 cranon process: the metacarpal bone corresponding with the radius has three

times the breadth of the bone opposite, at its middle ; there are two pba- 

 langes to the radial finger ; the ulnar phalanx is a slender Btyliforni ap- 

 pendage pointed inferiorly. 



The pelvis is narrow in front, broad posteriorly ; it presents a email pro- 

 cess on each side three lines behind the last rib , that portion of the pelvis 

 comprised between this process and the cotoloid cavity is much compressd ; 

 the ossa pubis look backwards as in most birds ; the cotyloid cavity is 

 incomplete posteriorly. 



Posterior extremities. There is no proper neck to the femur ; the large 

 trochanter presents a well marked rough process posteriorly ; there is no 

 small trochanter ; on the lower side of the trochanter at its inferior extremity 

 upon the anterior face of the bone, is a foramen three lines in length and two 

 in breadth, for the admission of air ; the outer condyle of the femur is large ; 

 the groove upon inferior part is well marked; there is a rough eminence upon 

 its external face, Avith a depression in front of it ; the upper surface of the 

 tibials flat for the most part ; the anterior margin projects considerably be- 

 yond the anterior face of the bone, but there is no spine extending upwards 

 as in some birds ; the superior extremity of the tibia is remarkable for the 

 deep i)it which it presents upon its posterior face ; it measures twelve lines 

 in length ; there are two holes at its distal extremity situated posteriorly, 

 with an oblique ridge between them ; it is triangular in form above, 

 rounded in the middle, and flattened inferiorly ; a marked depression ex- 

 ists upon the anterior face of it, at its inferior extremity. The foramen for 

 the transmission of the interosseous artery is placed two and a quarter 

 inches from the head of the tibia, about a line from its junction with the fi- 

 bula ; the fibula is a slender bone anchylosed with the tibia in the greater 

 part of its extent, as in other birds. The tarso metatarsal is the most remark- 

 able bone in the body ; it is a large and powerful bone, concave posteriorly, 

 presenting nnmerous very well marked depressions and elevated ridges upon 

 its anterior aspect ; there is a foramen for the transmission of air near its 

 outer margin, five lines from its proximal extrennity; there is also another two 

 lines in breadth, and two in extent, near its inner margin, within two and a 

 half lines of the snperior margin of the outer groove, at the extremity of the 

 bone; the outer aspect of the bone is flat in nearly its whole extent, presenting 

 a smooth surface ; it measures seven lines in an antero-posterior direction at 

 its middle ; its inner margin forms a sharp edge extending the whole length 

 of the bone as far as its junction with the accessory bone, for the articulation 

 with the first phalanx of the powerful back toe ; the articular eminences at 

 the extremity of the bone are separated from each other by intervals each 

 about two lines in breadth ; the middle eminence is the largest ; the remain- 

 ing two are of nearlj' equal size ; the articulation of the accessory bone is 

 placed seven lines and a half above the level of the anterior toes ; the access- 

 ory bone is large and triangular in shape, presenting a smooth surface for its 

 articulation with the first phalanx of the hind toe ; its posterior margin mea- 

 sures thirteen lines in length ; it presents a sharp edge continuous with 

 that of the inner margin of the tarso metatarsal bone for seyen lines

of its extent, the remaining portion being expanded laterally, and pre- 

 senting a somewhat oval and rough surface. The toes are strongly devel- 

 oped ; the back toe and inner toe are the most powerful ; the first phalanx 

 of the inner toe is remarkable for its shortness ; it is somewhat quadrangu- 

 lar in shape, and presents a deep groove upon its posterior extremity, for 

 articulation with the tarso -metatarsal bone.

 Observations on certain Fossils from the Collection of the Academy 

 of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 

 By Richard Owen, Esq., F. R. S., &c. &c. 



[The organic remains which form the subject of the following paper by 

 Prof. Owen, are apart of the series collected by James Hamilton Couper, 

 Esq., during the excavation of the Brunswick Canal, near Darien, in Geor- 

 gia. Prof. Owen, having expressed a wish to examine these fossils, they 

 were transmitted to him through Mr. Charles Lyell, by authority of the Aca- 

 demy, and the following highly interesting memoir was promptly returned. 

 Besides the references by Prof. Owen to Dr. Harlan's original paper in the 

 American Journal of Science, some valuable remarks by Mr. Couper him- 

 self, will be found in volume I. of these Proceedings, page 216.] 



Genus Bos. 



No. 1. Distal half of right humerus : it is about one-sixth less 

 than the same part in Bos primogenius, and more resembles that of 

 the Aurochs : it belongs, probably, to a species of Bison. 



No. 2. The left tibia of the same species. 



Genus Equus. 

 No. 3. Fragments of a lower molar tooth of the size of the Equus 

 cahellus : but the specific character not determinable. 



Genus Mastodon. 

 No. 4. A portion of tusk, labelled Hippopotamus, but satisfacto- 

 rily known to have belonged to a Proboscidian Pachyderm by the 

 decussating curved lines, intercepting lozenged -shaped spaces, at 

 the transverse fractures of the ivory at the two ends. (The struc- 

 ture is shown in British Fossil Mammalia, p. 291, fig. 101, c.) 



13 




94 [August, 1846. 



Transverse fractures of the tusks of Hippopotamus, show fine con- 

 centric lines, as figured in Briti.sli Fossil Mammalia, p. 402, fig. 100. 

 From the size, shape and slight degree of curvature of the Geor- 

 gian fossil, it may probably have belonged to the left side, lower 

 y\w, of the Mastodon yigantcus. 



Genus Uarlamus. 



No. 5. The middle part of the right ramus of the lower jaw of a 

 large Pachyderm, with the last three (or true) molars, part of the 

 premolar next in advance, and part of the socket of another premo- 

 lar. The crowns of all these teeth appear to have been wuro down 

 by mastication to their base ; they present the proportions, and the 

 last molar, in a cast transmitted to me by my lamented friend, Dr. 

 Harlan, appears to retain the anterior of the two large transverse 

 ridges, which characterize the teeth of the genus Lophiodon, Cuv.: 

 it likewise possesses the large posterior lobe or talon, which dis- 

 tinguishes this tooth in the Lophiodon from that of the Tapir. 

 The teeth of the fossil from Georgia a little exceed in size those of 

 the Lophiodon Isselanus (^Grand Lophiodon d'Issel, Cuvier, " Os- 

 semens Fossiles," ed. 1822 , torn. 2. pt. 1, p. 184, pi. 3, fig. ,3,) the 

 antero-posterior diameter of the last molar in that species being one 

 inch and eight lines, and in the present fossil one inch and ten 

 lines. But the depth of the jaw below the middle of the last molar 

 in the present fossil is three inches ; whilst that in the Lophiodon 

 isse?a?ms in the figure cited, is scarcely two inches; and Cuvier 

 expresslj' states (p. 186,) that it surpasses in depth the correspond- 

 ing part of the jaws of the Lophiodon medius (pi. 3, fig. 1,) which 

 has molar teeth of the same size as in the Lophiodon Issehinus, 



The present fossil has been described and figured in " Silliman's 

 American Journal of Science," vol. 43, 1842, pi. 3, fig. 1, under 

 the name of Sus Americana ; Dr. Harlan conceiving that from 

 its general appearance and number of the teeth this fragment 

 bore a close analogy with the same part in the Sus bahiruana, 

 BuflF, acknowledging, however, that the Babyroussa " was a 

 much smaller animal." Besides the difference of size, the last 

 molar in the fossil has the anteror transverse ridge proportion- 

 ally larger, and the posterior lobe proportionally smaller than in 

 the Babyroussa, resembling the Lophiodon in the points in which 




August, 1846.] 95 



it thus differs from the species of Sus cited. The form of the 

 fossil jaw differs at the part supporting the last molar from that in 

 the Babyroussa, where the socket of the last molar overhangs the 

 inner surface of the ramus, whilst in the fossil the inner surface 

 of the ramus beneath the last molar describes a gentle convexity 

 from the tooth to the lower margin of the ramus. The outer part 

 of the ramus of the jaw of the Babyroussa begins to expand be- 

 low the fourth and fifth molars, counting forwards from the last, 

 to form the socket of the large tusk; but the fossil jaw does not 

 offer the least indication of an enlargement for that purpose ; and 

 the fractured anterior end, as displayed in the cast, is very different 

 in shape from the corresponding part of the jaw in the Baby- 

 roussa, and shows merely the wide dental canal, and no socket 

 for the tusk which would be here situated in the Babyroussa or 

 Wild Boar. 



The nearest approximation which I could [make from a study 

 of a cast of the fossil in question to any known existing or extinct 

 animal, was to the great tapiroid Pachyderms j but I added in 

 my description of this cast in the Catalogue of Fossil Mamma- 

 lia and Birds in the College of Surgeons 4to. 1845, p. 198, " that 

 ulterior discoveries, may, indeed, show that the Lophiodont denti- 

 tion was combined with other characters in the American fossilj 

 necessitating a generic distinction, and it is well to remember that 

 the dentition of the Macranchenia of South America, a three-toed 

 Pachyderm with an astragalus almost identical with that of the 

 Lophiodon, and of a size which agrees with the jaw of the fossil 

 Sus Americana of Harlan, has yet to be discovered." 



The original of the cast shows the course of the enamel on the 

 outer side of the penultimate molar ; it there defines an anterior 

 lobe of the crown about one-third the antero-posterior extent of 

 the crown, by a close, straight fold of enamel penetrating inwards 

 about 2\ lines. • . 



The anterior lobe or transverse ridge of the corresponding tooth 

 of a Lophiodon might, perhaps, present a similar appearance, if 

 worn down to the base of the crown. 



But in the present fossil, the enamel proceeds to define a mid- 

 dle lobe on the outer side of the crown, shorter than the foregoing, 

 beyond which the enamel and dentine are worn obliquely away 

 to the base of the posterior fang ; the indication of the middle ex- 




96 August, 184C.] 



ternal lobe or festoon of enamel is, however, decisive against its 

 generic relationship with LoplnoJon. 



Tliis indication of the arrangement of the enamel,* slight as it 

 is, reminds one of that in the lower molars of the ToxoJon, and 

 another feature of resemblance is the apparent interruption of 

 the enamel at the anterior part of the molar in the fossil. If the 

 presence of two distinct fangs in the Georgian Fossil were adduced 

 as distinguishing it from the Toxodon, it might be replied that 

 perhaps the long curved rootless molars in that animal at the last 

 period of age might, as in the Horse, acquire roots. 



But the trilobed character is on the outside of the molar in 

 question, and on the inside of those of the Toxodon ; in which 

 also the middle lobe only has a coat of enamel, not the anterior 

 or posterior of the inner lobes : there is no doubt, therefore, that 

 the Georgian Pachyderm is generally distinct from Toxodon, as 

 it is from Lopliiodon ; and it would seem to have diminished the 

 interval which divides the strange Gliriform Pachyderm of South 

 America, from the more normal Tapiroid forms of Pachyderms 

 which are found fossil in the old world. 



As naturalists have accepted the latinized Indian word Tapirus 

 as the generic name of the existing American Pachyderm, which 

 makes the nearest approach to the present remarkable fossil, they 

 will probably sanction the application to the genus and species 

 which it represents, of the name Harlanus America nus ;'\ in honor 

 of the indefatigable and accomplished Naturalist by whom the fossil 

 was first made known to Science.

 Vice Presidext Morton in the Chair. 



The committee on Dr. Leidy'e paper, on a new genus and 

 species of Entozoa, reported in favor of publication. 



Description of a new yenus and species of Entozoa. 

 By Joseph Leidy, M. D. 



In the course of an investigation of the anatomical structure of 

 the terrestrial gasteropoda of the United States, I discovered a 

 microscopic entozoon inhabiting the fluid contained in the vessie 

 copulatrice or spermatbeca of Helix albolabris, since which I have 

 found it to exist in two other species, Helix tridentata, and Helix 

 alternata, and I have no doubt of its existence in others, not yet 

 having had an opportunity of examining further. As there ap- 

 pears to be no known genus in which this animal can be placed, 

 I have been necessitated to form the following : 



Cryptobia. Animal minute ; form exceedingly proteoid ; inter- 

 nal organization cellular or granular. 



C helicis. Colorless; form, ordinarily elongate, ellip- 

 solid, fusiform, or ovate; caudated, caudae opposite, one longer 

 than the other. Internal granular structure consisting of two 

 large cells and numerous minute granules. Total length from 

 the 126th to the 100th of a line. Habitat, the vessie copulatrice 

 or spermatbeca of Helix albolabris, Helix [tridentata and Helix 

 alternata. 



The name of this genus is derived from K/it/^rTdf, bidden and 

 HiSm^ to live. This singular entozoon in its general appearance 

 and organization appears to be intermediate between Cercaria 

 seminis and Filaria. Its varied form and movements are curious 

 to observe ; at one moment globular, then oval, ovate, fusiform, sig- 

 moid, crescentic, &c., it appears as if it would outvie the kalei- 

 doscope in its changes. The motions are vibratile, rotary, with 

 a lateral progression, or whirling in circles like the insect Gyrinus. 



Cryptobia helicis might be confounded with the spermatozoa 

 of the animals in which they are parasitic, on account of the organ in 

 which they are found being connected with the generative appara- 

 tus, and its supposed use aa a spermatbeca, but they may be readily 




September, 1846.] 101 



distinguished ; the spermatozoa of Helices generally having either 

 a uniform sigmoid or a beaded body, with an enormous propor- 

 tionate length of tail, and a slow, vibratile motion. It may be well 

 to mention that C. helicis does not exist in the collapsed state of 

 the generative organs. 



The subjoined sketch represents some of the principal forms 

 of the animal, highly magnified. 



The committee on the following description, bj Dr. Morton, 

 of two living Hybrid Birds, reported in favour of publication. 

 Description of two living Mi/hrid FowU, between Gallus and 



NUMIDA. 



By Samuel George Morton, M. D. 

 The singular birds which form the subject of this communica- 

 tion, were bred on a farm about seven miles from Wilmington, in 

 the State of Delaware. The person who raised them states, that 

 the eggs that produced them differed in no respect from those of 

 the guinea fowl, were part of a large number that were hatched 

 at the same time, and that the birds are known to be just four 

 years old. My friend, Mr. Augustus E. Jessup, having accident- 

 ally observed these birds on the above mentioned farm, pur_ 

 chased them of the proprietor, and sent them to my care, with a 

 request that they might be eventually placed in the Collections of 

 the Academy. Both are yet living and in good health ; and the 

 following description, in which I have been materially assisted by 

 my friend Mr. William Gambel, has been drawn up after many 

 examinations, made during a month and upwards that the birds 

 have been in the charge of Mr. Robert Kilvington, horticulturist 

 of this city. 




102 [September, 1846. 



The first of these birds is mottled with the colour of a reddish 

 brown chicken and guinea fowl, (Numida meleagris.) Back and 

 rump lineatcd with darkish brown and whitish, and a tinge of 

 yellowish brown. Greater wing-coverts, and margins of secon- 

 daries, reddish brown ; breast, belly, sides and under tail-coverta, 

 dirty white, with scattering feathers of the same. Quills and 

 tail-feathers dusky brown, lineatcd, and finely speckled like those 

 of the guinea fowl. Two quills in one wing and one in the tail ar« 

 entirely white. Wings concave and rounded, one foot in length 

 from flexure. First quill an inch and a half shorter than the 

 second, which last is one inch shorter than the third; 3 — 8 quills 

 about equal. Tail of fifteen feathers, rounded ; the two middle 

 ones longest and pointed. 



Heads sparsely covered with feathers, almost bare for a consi- 

 derable distance around the eye. Upper mandible dusky, except 

 at tip, which, with the lower mandible, is whitish ; towards tho 

 base it is somewhat striated, and covered by a reddish, fleshy 

 cere, elongated at the angle of the mouth into barbies, which, 

 however, are only rudimentary in comparison with those of the 

 guinea fowl. Beneath the skin a distinct, hard, bony ridge can 

 be felt, extending over the top of the head. Another bony ridge 

 extends over the eye, giving it a sunken appearance. The nos- 

 trils are half closed by a fleshy membrane ; sides of head and 

 front, white. Top of head and nape with linear black feathers, 

 elongated on the nape into hackles. Neck and upper part of the 

 breast reddish-brown. Tarsus very stout, with large, divided 

 scutellse; length 3§ inches; middle toe and nail 2| inches. Total 

 length about two feet. 



The second of these birds bears yet more resemblance to a 

 guinea fowl, both in shape and colour, than the preceding, not 

 being so much mottled with reddish-brown feathers, but princi- 

 pally with white. The bill appears to be not so much arched ; 

 the upper mandible is barbled as in the other, and the head is in 

 <reneral the same, Back, shoulders and upper tail-coverts dusky, 

 lineated with whitish like the guinea fowl ; greater wing-coverts, 

 fading into white, the tertiaries being margined with the same. 

 One quill white. Quills like the other as to colour and markings; 

 3d to 6th nearly equal. From flexure the wing measures llj 

 inches. 




September, 1846.] 108 



Back of head and neck with black linear feathers, not so 

 much like hackles, as those of the other bird. Breast, beneath 

 and sides, whitish. Tail nearly plucked out, as in the other; 

 upper tail-coverts, full and pendant. The bare flesh around the 

 eye in both birds is tinged with blue. 



The sounds which these birds utter are also intermediate, but 

 partake much more of the harshness of the guinea fowl, although 

 they occasionally cluck not unlike the common hen. 



They are shy, wild and resentful, boldly attacking any one who 

 irritates them. They have several times escaped from custody, 

 and. flown a hundred yards or more, when they alight and run 

 with great celerity. 



The sex of these birds has not been determined with certainty, 

 but the male characters seem to predominate. During the four 

 years they were on the farm, they were never observed to have 

 sexual intercourse with any other fowls. It is designed on a 

 future occasion to notice their anatomical peculiarities, when 

 the productive organs will be carefully examined. 



It has been remarked by a distinguished naturalist, that "many 

 of the birds which compose the gallinaceous order, appear to 

 be less difficult to unite with strange species, than those of any 

 other order. From the great majority of pheasants, mongrels 

 may thus be produced ; all the Hoccos (Crax) will couple together 

 in a state of domestication ; the pheasant will ally with the cock ; 

 the last with the turkey, with which the hoccos born in the do- 

 mestic state will also unite. It appears, in fact, very possible to 

 produce mongrels from the major part of those gallinse which 

 are suceptible of cultivation."* 



The latter remark receives strong corroboration from the facta 

 we have adduced in this paper; and we believe that a hybrid 

 progeny between the guinea fowl and common fowl is now for 

 the first time made known to naturalists. The fact derives its 

 peculiar interest from the remoteness of the genera which have thus 

 produced an intermediate variety.

[September, 1846. 



The committee on tlie following ])apfr by Dr. Joseph 

 LeiJy, reported in favor of publication. 



On the mechanism which closes the membranous wings of the genus 



Locusta. 

 By Joseph Leidy, M. D. 



The membranous wings or alee of the locusta while at rest are 

 folded up, like a closed fan, beneath the anterior pergamentaceous 

 wings. These are opened or expanded by the contraction of 

 appropriate muscles (extensores alae) contained within the thorax; 

 the tendons of which are inserted into the ribs or longitudinal 

 veins at the root of the wings. When one of the wings is sepa- 

 rated from the body of the insect, and stretched open by* the 

 fingers, upon letting go, it will be found instantly to close or re- 

 sume the position of rest. 



The mechanism which produces this closure in the separated 

 wing, as well as when attached to tlie living animal, I find to 

 be spiral ligamentous bands, wound, like the thread of a screw, 

 around the transverse or connecting veins, which latter arc also 

 flexible. By this arrangement, upon the contraction of the alary 

 extensors, the spring-like ligaments, or ligamenta spiralia as I 

 will call them, are stretched in the expansion of the wings, and 

 upon the relaxation or cessation of the action of the muscles, the 

 physical properties alone of the ligamenta spiralia, in resuming 

 their unstretched state, close the wings. These ligamenta spiralia 

 are numerous, and exist in all the species of Locusta possessing 

 perfect alae which I have examined. To this short description I 

 append a drawing of several of these ligaments, magnified, from a 

 preparation in Canada balsam, of one of the alae of Locusta Caro- 

 lina.

Dr. Dickeson exhibited a large and remarkably varied series 

 of fossil bones, obtained by him from the vicinity of Natchez, 

 Miss. The collection embraces the entire head and half of the 

 lower jaw of the Megalonyx Jeffersoni,* now for the first time 

 discovered ; together with many parts of the skeleton, and indeed 

 of several skeletons of that animal, sufficient to enable its com- 

 plete osteological reconstruction. The stratum that contains these 

 organic remains, i§ a tenacious blue clay that underlies the dilu- 

 vial drift east of Natchez, and which diluvial deposit abounds in 

 bones and teeth of the Mastodon giganteum. 



* Dr. Dickeson originally suggested, from partial comparisons, that 

 this cranium belonged to the Megalonyx, and not to the Mylodon, as others 

 had supposed ; his opinion was fully confirmed by M. Agassiz oa 

 a recent examination ; and this distinguished naturalist has proved the 

 Megalonyx laqxitatus of Harlan, to belong, not to Megalonyx, but to some 

 other but nearly allied genus. 




October, 1846.] 107 



The animals associated with the Megalonyx are, an Ursus, a 

 Bos, two species of Cervus, one or two species of Equus, and 

 several undetermined genera, all which are now in progress of 

 delineation and description for the Academy's Journal. 



Dr. Dickeson presented another relic of yet greater interest ; 

 viz., the fossil os innominatum of the human subject, taken from 

 the above mentioned stratum of blue clay, and about two feet 

 below the skeletons of the Megalonyx and other extinct genera of 

 quadupeds. 



This ancient relic of our species, is that of a young man of about 

 sixteen years of age, as determined by its size and form, and by the 

 fact that the epiphyses have separated from the tuberosity of the 

 ischium, and from the crista of the ilium. Nearly all the os 

 pubis is wanting, the upper posterior part of the ileum is broken 

 away, and but half the acetabulum remains. That this bone is 

 strictly in the fossil state, is manifest from its physical characters, 

 in which it accords in every respect of color, density, &c., &c., 

 with those of the Megalonyx and other associated boues. That 

 it could not have drifted into the position in which it was found, 

 is manifest from several facts: 1. That the plateau of blue clay 

 is not appreciably acted on by those causes that produce ravines 

 in the superincumbent diluvial ; 2. That the human bone was 

 found at least two feet below three associated skeletons of the 

 Megalonyx, all which, judging from the opposition or proximity 

 of their several parts, had been quietly deposited in this locality, 

 independently of any active current or other displacing power; 

 and lastly, because there was no admixture of diluvial drift with 

 the blue clay, which latter retains its homogeneous character 

 equally in the higher part that furnished the extinct quadrupeds, and • 

 in its lower part that contained the remains of man. Dr. Dicke- 

 son has announced his intention of returning, at an early period 

 of the present autumn, to resume his explorations in this prolific 

 and most interesting locality ; and it is earnestly hoped that his 

 researches may lead to a further elucidation of this important 

 question in science. 



Dr. Leidy stated that he had lately detected the existence 

 of an Entozoon in the superficial part of the extensor mus- 




108 [October, 1846. 



cles of the thigli of a hog. Tlie Entozoon is a minute, coiled 

 worm, contained in a cyst. The cyst arc numerous, white 

 oval in sliapo, of a gritty nature, and between the 30th and 

 40th of an incli in length. 



The Entozoon he supposes to be the Trichina spiralis, 

 heretofore considered as peculiar to the human species. He 

 could perceive no distinction between it and the specimens 

 of T. spiralis which he had met with in several human sub- 

 jects in the dissecting rooms, where it had also been observed 

 by others, since the attention of the scientific public had been 

 directed to it by Mr. Hilton and Prof. Owen. 



Dr. Leidy also exhibited a singular knotted mass of living 

 Gordii, or hair worms, with numerous long strings of ova at- 

 tacked, which had been taken a few days since from one of 

 the hydrants of this city.

Professor Johnson read an extract of a letter from Judge 

 Tremper, in continuation of his observations on the tempera- 

 ture and evaporation of Seneca Lake ; also some remarks on 

 the increased rapidity of evaporation from the earth, when 

 the herbage is closely cropped, as in grazing and pasture 

 fields, and the causes thereof. 



Dr. Dickeson stated, that having noticed some tracks re- 

 sembling Ornithichnites, which were produced by the Alliga- 

 tor, he was induced to cause some tracks to be made in clay 

 by that animal, several of which impressions he exhibited. 

 He also mentioned that tracks of other animals had been re- 

 peatedly noticed by him, which he thought closely resembled 

 the so-called bird tracks of the sandstone slab this evening 

 presented to the Society. 



Dr. Dickeson also made some interesting observations in 

 relation to the habits of the Alligator. 



Professor Johnson offered some remarks on Drift : — He re- 

 marked that in the vicinity of St. John's, N. B., he had met 

 with some well marked examples of diluvial action, as evin- 

 ced by scratches on the rocks at great depth. In some cases 

 the grooves were to be found well marked on the side of the 

 rock, while on the other no such action was manifest ; but 

 boulders not in situ were deposited there, as if from the action 

 of a current in a direction from the grooved to the unaffected 

 side of the rock. These boulders also exhibited grooves on 

 their surface.

 PASSERES. 

 HiRUNDO fhallassina, Swains. Violet-green Swallow. 

 This beautiful species I fonnd passing to the northward through Califor- 

 nia, in the spring, 



HiEUNDO fulva, Vieill. Republican Swallow. 



This is the most abundant swallow on our western coast, and arrives in 

 California about the latter part of February or beginning of March. They 

 immediately resort to the neighborhood of the towns, missions and farm- 

 houses, and soon commence repairing their old retort-shaped nests, with 

 which sheltered walls, the eves, and even window frames of the houses, are 

 sometimes nearly covered. The nest is also frequently made on the trunk.' 

 of large trees in the woods. They are very loath to quit their old nesting 

 places, and will persist in building them up, however often they may be 

 destroyed either by the rain or the inhabitants. 



Chelidon bicolor, Vieill. White-bellied Swallow. 



This is also a common species, and a few appear to remain all winter, but 

 the greater pari arrive about the latter part of February. At Santa Barbara, 




October, 1846.] Ill 



I found their nests, as usual, in the knot holes of the evergreen oaks in 

 April. 



CoTYLE rijparia, Linn. Bank Swallow. 



Common ; burrowing their nests in the sandy banks of small streams and 

 creeks, which have worn deep ravines. 



I also observed another swallow, not far from Monterey, in August, 

 with a deeply forked tail, like our barn swallow, but apparently differently 

 marked. 



Ceryle alcyon, Linn. Kingfisher. 



Common along the whole of the western coast. In California it is never 

 observed to frequent the inland streams and creeks, being exclusively found 

 along the rocky shores and islands. 



Calliphlox rufa, Gmel. Rufous Humming Bird. 



This beautiful little flame bearer is not unfrequent throughout California. 



Calliphlox anna, Less. Anna Humming Bird. 



Trochilus kterocephalas. Nutt. Man. Orn. vol. 1, 2d Ed. p. 712. 



A very abundant and interesting species, numbers passing the winter in 

 California ; at such times inhabiting sheltered hill sides and plains, where at 

 all seasons a few bushy plants are in flower, and afford it a scanty subsist- 

 ence. They appear, however, in greater numbers about the latter part 0^ 

 February and during the month of March ; the country is soon carpeted 

 with flowers, and the Anna humming bird, revelling among their sweets, 

 commences the duty of rearing its young. About the Pueblo, the vineyards 

 and gardens are its favourite resort, forming its delicate downy nest in a 

 small flowering bush, or some concealed spot about the fence. In April 

 and May these may be found in almost every garden. 



In other parts it attaches its nest almost exclusively to a low, horizontal 

 branch of the evergreen oak. (Quercus agrifolia) so common throughout the 

 country ; the nest is small, being about an inch in depth and one and a quar- 

 ter in diameter ; it is not very thick, and is formed in the most delicate man- 

 ner of pappus and down of various plants, held together and matted into a 

 soft felt with spider's webs, which latter I have frequently observed them 

 collecting for the purpose in the spring along hedges and fence rows, and at 

 first supposed they were only searching them for gnats and small insects 

 which might be entangled, but in a nest which I now have the base is formed 

 of a few dried male aments of the oak, and which with the adjoining felt- 

 like matting of pappus, is agglutinated and bound around the twig with a 

 thick layer of spider's web. The eggs, as usual, are two, white and ellip- 

 tical. The note resembles that of the Rufous humming bird, and is a slender 

 chep, frequently repeated, but during the breeding season they are very 

 pugnacious, and the little combatants dart through the trees, like meteors, 

 uttering a loud and repeated twittering scold. It has the same habit also. 




112 [October, 1846. 



that has been remarked in the rufous humming bird, that of ascending in 

 clear weatlier to a considerable licight in the air, and then descending with 

 great rapidil.)', uttering at the same time a peculiar note. 



Nuttall, who brought this species from California, did not procure the 

 male, but saw it frequently, and supposed it to have a yellow spot on the 

 crown. I discovered that that which deceived him in this respect was the 

 glutinous pollen of a tubular flower upon which it feeds, adhering to the 

 rigid feathers of the crown, and making it look as if it rea!Iy had a yellow 

 head. I have also seen the bill for half its length covered in the same 

 manner. 



SiTTA carolinmsis, Briss. Carolina Nuthatch. 



This species is common in the pines of the Rocky Mountains, and also in 

 the wooded regions of the western coast. 



SiTTA canadensis, Linn. Canada Nuthatch. 



I found this little wanderer very abundant in the mountains of the inte- 

 rior of California in October, roving in company with busy flocks of the 

 Parus monlanus nobis. 



SiTTA pyymcea, Vigors. Pigmy Nuthatch. 



Extremely abundant in winter in Upper California, sometimes almost 

 covering the trunks and branches of the pine trees, through which they ex- 

 clusively forage. Around Monterey, particularly, the trees at times are alive 

 with the noisy little creatures, incessantly uttering their monotonous queru- 

 lous notes as they run around the branches. The note is generally a repeated 

 whistling, wit, ivit, which, when one commences, the rest join in ; they also 

 utter a whistling trill, at the same time industriously searching the tree 

 throughout, and only leaving it when every crack has been examined for 

 the concealed insect fare. 



Harpes rediviva, Nobis, Proceed. Acad. Nat. Sc. vol. 2, p. 264. 



Promerops de la Galifornie Septentrionale, La Perouse. Atlas to voy- 

 ages, pi. 47. 



This very remarkable bird was first noticed by La Perouse, who figured 

 it in the atlas to his voyages, and subsequently by other writers when 

 treating of the Tenuirostres, on his authority, as a Promerops. 



On comparison, it will be found more properly to belong to the great 

 family Certhidse, and is allied to the oven birds of S. America, (Furnarius) 

 both in general appearance, and as far as I can gather, in habits also, but 

 the bill bears a greater resemblance to some of the large wren-like birds 

 (Thryothorus ?) of tropical America. 



It does not stand alone in our country; I have lately been shown by Mr 

 Audubon a specimen received from near Galveston, Texas, which he sup- 

 posed to be the bird I had described, but upon comparison, it proved to 

 be a distinct species with the bill more curving at the tip, and not so much 

 flattened, of which no doubt a description will soon be published. 




October, 1846.] 113 



Teoglodytes Bewiekii, Aud. Bewick's "Wren. 



Common, keeping in low bushes and piles of brush, as well as about old 

 dead trees and logs, over and around which it flits with the greatest ac- 

 tivity, uttering, when approached, the usual grating scold of the wrens. 



TBOGLoDYTBa ^aZ«5<rM, Wils. Marsh Wren. 



I found this epecies in small reedy marshes in the Rocky Mountains of 

 the interior, in October. 



Troglodytes sylvestris, Nobis. Audubon's Wood Wren, 



T. Americana, Aud. Orn. Bicg., vol. 2, p. 452, pi. 179. 



A summer resident among the evergreen oaks of California, in which 

 it sings and breeds. 



I have changed the name of this species from that given by its discoverer, 

 because that a Troglodytes AmericanuSf from Cayenne, was described by 

 Cuvier, in the Gal. du Paris. See Lesson's Traite de Ornithologie, p. 400. 



SiAL, artica, Swains. Artie Blue bird. 



This beautiful azure songster is common throughout the northern pro- 

 vinces of Mexico. In the neighborhood of Santa Fe it is abundant, keeping 

 about the houses and gardens where they breed, sometimes forming its 

 nest in boxes which are stuck up for the purpose by the inhabitants. In 

 the ranges of the Rocky Mountains, as far as California, we frequently found 

 it, and always associated with the S. Mexicana, both at this season occa- 

 sionally uttering their cheerful song to remind us of home. 



SiALiA Mexicana, Swains. Western Blue bird. 



S. occidentalis, Townsend, Aud. 



This epecies is found throughout the Rocky Mountains, in company with 

 the former, and in California is by far the moat abundant species. In 

 April and May, I found it breeding in the knot holes of the evergreen 

 oaks. During winter they assemble in small flocks, and frequent the 

 weedy plains and valleys of the moautains. 



TuRDus migratorius, Linn. American Robin. 



We found the Robin scatteringly throughout the Rocky Mountains, and 

 a few are found at all seasons, in California. 



TuRDus ncEvius, Gmel. Varied Thrush. 



I have only observed this beautiful species to pass throagh California 

 during the spring and autumn, in silent flocks. 



ToEDUs minor Gmel. Hermit Thrush. 



T. nanus. Dwarf Thrush, Aud. Orn. Biog. 5, p, 204, pi. 419 ; Nutt. 

 Man. p. 396, 



T. aolitarius. Auc. 



The confusion hitherto existing in the description of the nearly allied 

 group of Thrushes to which this belongs, has rendered the determination 

 of the epecies exceedingly diflBcult, and at beat but a matter of uncertaintyj 




114 [OCTOBHR, 184G. 



The Dwftrf Thrush of Audubon was founded upon specimens from the 

 Atlantic States, and no doubt upon the true Hermit Thrush. 



Mr. Pickering, and also Mr. Nuttall, must have had the T. oUvaceus, 

 since characterized by Drs. Brewer and Giraud before them, and mis- 

 taking it for the Hermit Thrush, when they distinguished the T. nanus as a 

 species. 



An examination of Epecimens of the T. minor from the Atlantic and 

 Pacific coasts of North America shows no diflference in any way, except 

 that perhaps the western one is somewhat smaller, yet the difference is 

 scarcely appreciable. From the measurement of many western specimens, 

 I found its length to be 6} inches, and the extent of wings lOjinches ; the 

 tail, wings, and relative length of quills the same as in our eastern one, 

 and in fact, I think it can in no possible way be distinguished as specifi- 

 cally different. A European specimenalso of the same species, from the RI- 

 Toli collection, now in the Academy, is the same in every respect as our own. 



That which is most remarkable in the character of this delicate and 

 gentle bird, is its solitary and retiring disposition ; avoiding the ruthless 

 gaze of man, it glides into the deepest shade of the forest or underwood, 

 and is but seldom seen, except unconsciously, when earnestly engaged, 

 scratching upon the ground in search of food ; or else, it be discovered 

 while perched upon a low leafy branch or twig, when it allows a very 

 near approach, as if depending for concealment and security upon the 

 thickness of the foliage and bushes around. 



In the wooded regions of the Rocky mountains, I found it not uncom- 

 mon, always keeping on, or very near the ground. It is very frequent 

 throughout California, and in the spring may be found in the retired 

 hedges of the vineyards, where very possibly it breeds. 



MiMCS montanus, Towns. Mountain Mocking bird. 



We occasionally met with individuals of this mocking bird along the 

 bushy banks of streams in the interior, during September and October, 

 then silent. 



Hmva polygloids, Linn. Common Mocking bird. 



I observed a few of these in sheltered ravines during the winter, and in 

 May, around Santa Barbara, the woods were ringing with their inimitable 

 song, at this time, mimicking Bullock's oriole, and the western Blue bird. 



CiNCLUS Americamts, Swains. American Dipper. 



A few of these are found along the solitary streams of the interior, 



Anthus Ludovidanus, Licht. American Titlark. 



This species appears to be one of the most extensively distributed of X. 

 American birds, being found throughout the length and breadth of our conn- 

 try. In the desert regions, between Santa Fe and California, it was one of 

 the few birds we met with ; then going in small flocks, either on the plains 

 among arid Artemesia and sage bushes, or along the courses of rivers and 

 small streams. In California it is abundant, particularly in winter, when 




October, 1846.] 115 



it frequents the seashore to pick up insects, and perhaps small shells, from 

 the seaweed which is cast ashore. 

 Regulcs calendula. Ruby- crowned Kinglet. 



This species, like many of the most diminutive birds, is found dis- 

 tributed over the whole extent of our vast continent, thereby showing its 

 connection as a single zoological centre or province of creation. 



In the highest ranges of the Roeky mountains, we met with the Ruby- 

 crowned wren in large flocks, roaming in company with the Par us minimus, 

 Towns., also in large flocks, enlivening those dreary solitudes with their 

 restless activity and twittering while in search of food. Throughout Cali- 

 fornia it is equally abundant ; ever varying habits and note making it but 

 too often the victim of the gun in supposition of being something else. 



The Report of the Corresponding Secretary was read and 

 adopted. 



By permission of the Society, a paper was read, entitled, 

 ' On several new genera and species of Insects, by S. S. 

 Haldeman,' which was referred to a committee, consisting 

 of Messrs. Leidy, Hallowell, and Bridges.

120 [Nov., 1846. 



encc to his recent donation to the Academy, of a fine ppeci- 

 men of fossil tracks in the red sandstone of the Connecticut 

 Valley. 



"It may not be improper for me to add, that we were shown on 

 a large block of stone, by a gentleman connected with the quar- 

 ries, tracks resembling those of some of our land animals, per- 

 haps those of a mink in size. They were very distinct, though 

 rather lightly impressed, there being, I believe, two rows across 

 the stone. And that early last spring I found among some frag- 

 ments, thrown out in consequence of sinking a well deeper, in 

 Rockyhill, Ct., a specimen of fossil shell, or something having a 

 close resemblance to one. One side of it is very perfect, the 

 other is embedded in the stone, and is probably a small bi-valve, 

 nearly an inch in length, and ne?r three quarters of an inch in 

 breadth. I sent it to Professor Silliman, with permission to 

 deposit it in the cabinet of Yale College. If a shell, it appears 

 to be the first we have any account of as having been found in the 

 sandstone of the Connecticut Valley. 



The suggestion that the fossil tracks may probably be those of 

 some Sauroid reptile, is doubtless worthy of attention. But from 

 the few observations I made during my four years' residence at the 

 University of that place, I am inclined to the opinion that they can 

 never be attributed to any other than biped animals of some type 

 or other. Where opportunity is afforded for the inspection of a large 

 number of successive tracks, they are found to be at regular 

 intervals, along a line in the direction of the motion of the centre 

 of gravity of the animals; and the line drawn through the heel 

 and centre toe makes but a small deflexion from the line of motion 

 of the animal. In all the tracks which I have earfully noticed, each 

 alternate track exactly resembles that which precedes it, and in 

 some cases where there is a slight peculiarity in one of the feet, 

 this fact is very apparent. The heel of the track does not exhibit 

 any sign of the impression of a portion of the leg adjoining the 

 foot, not even where the animal has passed up or down a small 

 declivity, as was the case with some tracks on that portion of the 

 specimen in your museum, destroyed by the workup en in our 

 absence. If uric acid is found only in the excrements of birds, 




Nov., 1846.] 121 



the analysis of some of the coprolites found in the valley is pretty 

 conclusive evidence that birds did exist there at the time the sand- 

 stone was forming. 



Now if we take the Crocodile, Alligator, or any of the Saurian 

 type with which we are acquainted, we should expect to see their 

 tracks made at irregular intervals, and at some distance on either 

 side of a plane passing perpendicularly through the centre of 

 gravity of the animal in the direction of its motion, especially 

 when we consider the width the feet are separated, and the 

 clumsy manner in which these animals must move. These ani- 

 mals would, in all probability, leave the print of a portion of the 

 leg next the foot, and which, if I mistake not, is the case with the 

 fossil tracks acknowledged to be of the Sauroid character, found 

 in the same valley." 



Dr. Morton concluded the reading of his memoirs on '^ Hybridity 

 in animals considered in reference to the question of the Unity of 

 the Human Species," and after some general remarks, submitted 

 the following conclusions : 



1. A latent power of hybridity exists in many animals in the 

 wild state, in which state, also, hybrids are sometimes produced. 



2. Hybridity takes place not only among diflFerent species, but 

 also among different genera ; and the cross-breeds have been 

 prolific in both cases. 



3. Domestication does not cause this faculty, but merely 

 evolves it. 



4. The capacity for fertile hybridity, cceteris paribus, exists 

 in animals in proportion to their aptitude for domesticity and culti- 

 vation. 



5. Since various species of an'mals are capable of producing a 

 fertile hybrid offspring, hybridity ceases to be a test of specific 

 affiliation. 



6. Consequently, the mere fact that the several races of man- 

 kind produce, with each other, a more or less fertile progeny, 

 constitutes, in itself, no proof of the unity of the human species.

Prof. Johnson announced to the Academy the decease of 

 our late fellow member, Isaiah Lukens, Esq. After some 

 very appropriate remarks on the character, high qualities and 

 scientific attainments of the deceased, the following resolu- 

 tions were submitted by him : 



Resolved, That thi'' Acadeinj has heard with deep regret the 

 los3 it has sustained in the demise of our late able and excellent 

 associate, Isaiah Lukens, one of th3 earliest members of this 

 institution. 



Resolved, That through the whole period of its existence, this 

 Academy has felt the beneficial influence of the personal worth 

 of our late coadjutor, and of his firm, unwavering support of the 

 interests of this institution ; of bis sound and discriminating judg- 

 ment in various departments of science ; of his constant devotion 

 to knowledge and the useful arts, and of his sincere uncompromis- 

 ing love of truth. 



Resolved, That the members of this Academy deeply sympa- 

 thize with the relatives and friends of the deceased in the bereave- 

 ment they have sustained by the death of our lamented associate ; 

 that they recall with a melancholy pleasure the many happy and 

 profitable hours which they have passed in his society; that they 

 dwell with unmixed satisfaction on the memory of his free and 

 generous spirit, ever ready to communicate of his abundant stores 

 of useful knowledge, ever wise and liberal in his estimate of the 

 labors and characters of others, ever modest and reserved in what 

 concerned his own peculiar and distinguished merits. 



Resolved, That we cherish a deep sense of the value of that 

 combination of intelligence with useful labor for which our 




124 [Nov., 1846. 



departed friend was so fiipnallj characterized, and cannot with- 

 hold the tribute of our admiration from that devotion to duty 

 which found him, as his lamp of life was drawing to its last faint 

 glimmer, ptill at his post, intent on the fulfilment of u professioual 

 service, while his dying breath expressed his ^'ratitude for the 

 privilege of having lived at a period when so much of truth and 

 improvement had been developed in the world, and that in his 

 day and generation he had been permitted to share in the many 

 and varied enjoyments which science and ingenuity had dif- 

 fused. 



Resolved, That a member of the Academy be appointed to pre- 

 pare a suitable memoir of our departed fellow member. 



Resolved, That a copy of the foregoing resolutions be communi- 

 cated to the family of the deceased, with the heartfelt condolence 

 of the Academy on this mournful occasion. 



The resolutions were unanimously adopted, and Prof. 

 Johnson appointed to prepare the memoir.

The Monthly Report of the Corresponding Secretary was

The Committee on the following paper by Mr. Ilaldeman, 

 reported in favor of publication. 



On several New Genera and Species of Insects. 



By S. S. Haldeman. 



Whilst engaged in making dissections of the mouth of several 

 species of Copris for the purpose of learning their true generic 

 character, I was struck with the dissimilarity existing in the la- 

 brum. I consider the European CoPRis huiari's as the type of the 

 genus, because European naturalists have usually constructed 

 the genera, and the type should be a species whose habits are 

 well known. To prevent confusion, the author who subdivide." 




Nov., 1846.] 125 



an old genus, should "generally be allowed to decide what portion 

 is to retain the old generic name. The rule which adopts as the 

 type the species which stands first in an author's work, is not 

 applicable in all cases, because these were not always considered 

 the type of the genus. An author might name a genus Geo- 

 TRTJPES from the known habits of a European species, and com- 

 mence his list with a large exotic species having entirely different 

 habits, and not really congeneric with it. In such a case it would 

 be obviously improper to consider the latter as the type of the 

 genus Geotrupes. Moreover, instead of being the type, the 

 initial species may have been thus placed from its resemblance 

 to the preceding genus ; and it is obvious that the animal which 

 most nearly approaches another genus, cannot be the type of that 

 to which it really belongs. 



1. Brachycopris. The type of this new genus is the well 

 known Copris Carolina. In Copris the labrum is subquadrate, 

 rather widest anteriorly ; the anterior margin transverse, slightly 

 emarginate, with a medial projecting appendicle, and the ex- 

 terior margins rounded. In Brachico- 

 PRIS the labrum is distantly triangular, 

 widest at base, and much narrowed an- 

 teriorly, where it is deeply emarginate, 

 leaving a lateral aculeate process, the 

 appendicle projecting from the base of 

 the emargination, as represented in the 

 figure. The basal articulation of the 

 labial palpi is proportionally much 

 larger than in Copris. This body is con- 

 tracted in length ; and in the type, the elytra are sulcate and the 

 tibiae unarmed. 



Copris nwlosstts would upon first view be placed nearer to C. 

 Carolina than to C. hinaris, or the American C. anaglj/pticus, 

 Say. Its labrum, however, associates it with these. Mr. Hope 

 has made it the type of his genus Catharsius. It has the labrum 

 more regular, more nearly quadrate, and the anterior half only 

 of the medial solid portion is covered with hair, the posterior 

 portion presenting a smooth furrow with a well defined margin. 



2. Prion us Jissicomis. General characters as in P. imhri- 

 cornis. Blackish brown, antennae thick, imbricate, reaching the 

 middle of the elytra, 25 articulate, canaliculate beneath by means 

 of a deep emargination in the articulations, which are somewhat 

 V-shaped when detached, the posterior branch the longer, with 

 its apex incurved : prothorax with three lateral teeth. 11 lines 



long- 



For this interesting species I am indebted to my friend Dr. J. 

 L. Le Conte, who found it near the Rocky mountains. It is re- 




126 [Nov., 1846. 



marlvublc for the emargination and nuiuljer of lLc articulations of 

 the antcunjc, which are more numerous than in any native specicR 

 hitherto described. The ghibuhir base of the second i.s not enu- 

 merated ; twenty-four are imbricate, and the final one has a small 

 additional process rising out of its concavity. In 1*. imbricornis 

 the antennec of the male have nineteen, and of the female, seven- 

 teen articulations. 



3. SpiiENOSTETnus. Allied to Prtonus. Head small, narrower 

 than the thorax, concave above; eyes slightly emarginate ante- 

 riorly ; antenna) less than half the entire length, slender and com- 

 pressed, second articulation longest, subserjuent ones gradually 

 decreasing, with a tendency to serration beneath ; mandibles ro- 

 bust, toothed; palpi with the terminal articulation triangular: 

 prothoras transverse, narrower than the elytra, contracted ante- 

 riorly, concave posteriorly, the external margins unarmed : pro 

 and mesosternum conjointly carinate, in close contact, the latter 

 entering an acute emargination of the former : scutel triangular : 

 elytra separately rounded at base, moderately tapering and 

 dehiscent; sides incurved, apex minutely serrate : feet slender. 



4. S. se-n-ijyennis. Shining black, punctate scabrous above ; front 

 with a wide depression having an impressed medial line; pro- 

 notum with two approximate impressed punctures upon each 

 side arranged diagonally, medial line visibly impressed poste- 

 riorly; external margins convex, emarginate at the posterior 

 angles ; posterior margin convex in the centre and concave late- 

 rally : elytra meeting the pronotum in close contact, a .'^hallow 

 scabrous impression at the base ; apex finely serrate. Length 

 111 ; prothorax 2; elytra 8; "vidth at base 4 lines. 



A single specimen taken in south-eastern Pennsylvania. An- 

 other seen in Le Conte's cabinet, probably taken in New York. 

 Probably allied to Prionus muticus, Fabr. ii. 265. It is remarka- 

 ble for the close contact of the prothorax with the elytra and scutel 

 above and the mesosternum below. 



5. MoLORCHUS tenuipes. Black, frontal line deeply impressed : 

 prothorax cylindric : elytra dark fuscous, obsoletely fulvous at base : 

 medial and posterior feet very slender. 3 lines long. 



The larva inhabits detached branches of the genus Carya, 

 (hickory), the perfect insect appearing in May in S. E. Pennsyl- 

 vania. 



6. Enoplium vennstum. Dark brown, with minute fulvous 

 hairs : middle of the elytra with a broad irregular transverse silvery 

 band. 41 lines long. South-eastern Pennsylvania. 



Base and half the terminal articulation of the antenna;, palpi, 

 anterior tarsi, and base of the femora, pale yellow: pronotum tu- 

 berculate : elytra with numerous dilated impressed punctures : 

 apex pale yellowish brown, and with the base marked with a 

 few small spots of yellow; the central white portion has several 




Nov., 1846.] 127 



spots of black, and is bounded posteriorly by a black zigzag line, 

 the black enlarging towards the suture ; medial and posterior 

 feet pale yellow ; the femora with the middle and the tibiae with 

 the terminal half, brown. Apparently allied to E. bimaculafum, 

 Mels., Proceed. Acad. 2, 307. According to Dr. Le Conte this 

 is the venustum of Dejean's Catalogue. 



7. Heterodromia [Fam. Donaciadae.] Body slender, punc- 

 tate-scabrous : head advanced; eyes rather prominent, reticulate ; 

 antennse 11-articulate, slender, longer than the head and pro- 

 thorax, first articulation longer than the .second and third, last 

 fusiform : mandibles strong, short, incurved : palpi 3-articulate, 

 final articulation subsecuriform, prothorax subelougate, narrowed 

 behind : elytra subparallel, narrowing towards the apex, wider 

 than the prothorax, conjointly rounded at tip : feet slender, sub- 

 elongate, posterior femora incrassute. 



8. H. velox. Thickly punctured, hirsute, pale yellow ; head, 

 anterior margin of the prothorax, and seventh, (at the apex) eighth, 

 ninth and tenth articulations of the antennge, black : elytra lineate 

 punctate, with a tendency to fuscous behind the middle : abdo- 

 men obscure fuscous, feet pale. 4 J milliin. long. 



Var. a. Having three transverse fuscous dots on the pronotum, 

 and a large sutural fuscous spot at the base of the elytra. 



Found in May, upon grass and under stones and rubbish, in 

 Pennsylvania, Carolina, Alabama and Ohio. It runs with great 

 rapidity, and resembles some of the Carabidse. The species de- 

 scribed might at first view be taken for the Demetrias atricapillus, 

 Linn. 



9. Trogus nuhilipennis. Fulvous ; antennae, eyes, vertex, and 

 five terminal segments of the abdomen, with half the preceding 

 one, black : wings fuliginous, mottled with a few spots of yellow 

 in the middle and at the base : mesosternum tipped with black : 

 abdomen shining black beneath : inside of the base of the femora 

 and trochanters blackish : tibise, tarsi, front and base of the an- 

 tennae beneath, yellow. 11 lines long, expanse 19. 



About a year ago I sent a description and specimen abroad, 

 which seems to differ from the present one, as the segment of the 

 abdomen upon which the two colors meet is described with ''ma- 

 cula longitudinali nigra in medio, et nigro-marginato ;" and the 

 wings " fuligine flavoque nubilatis." There are a few minute 

 white specks upon the alar nervures ; one on the medial, a little 

 within the small intercubital cell; one exterior to the same cell ; 

 and two on the interdiscoidal nervure running from it. 



10. Ibalia maculipennis 5 . Yellow ; meso-and metathorax black, 

 except the scutel and two longitudinal bands above, and a spot 

 beneath the wings : eyes, apex of the antennae, base of the coxje, 

 and middle of the femora, (the greater part of the posterior ones) 




128 [Nov., 1846. 



black : posterior tibiae blackinh towards the apex : wings yellow, 

 apex and a central spot fulij^inous. 7 lines long, 11 expanse.

The following amondmcnts to the By-Laws were adopted: 



Chap. y. Art. VI., to commence thus : " The duty of the 

 Librarian shall be to attend daily at the Hall from 11 o'clock,

And to add to the same Chapter : 



Art. VIII. The Chairman of the Curators shall attend 

 daily at the Hall from 2|, P. M. until sunset, to perform 

 the duties of his office. 



The following preamble and resolutions, offered by Dr. 

 Morton, were adopted ; 



Whereas, Dr. Thomas B. Wilson has made this institution 

 the depository of his magnificent collection of Birds, which, 

 from the number, beauty and variety of its specimens, al- 

 ready ranks as the fourth extant ; and 



Whereas, Dr. Wilson is assiduously extending and perfect- 

 ing this collection for the interests of science and of this in- 

 stitution ; and 



Whereas, The collection of the Academy is comparatively 

 small and incomplete, and must continue to be so, inasmuch 

 as the former incentive to increase it no longer exists, and 

 also since two collections in Ornithology are unnecessary 

 and inexpedient ; 



Therefore, Resolved, That the collection of birds now 

 belonging to the Academy, be merged in the Wilson Col- 

 lection. 



Resolved, That the galleries now occupied by the Orni- 

 thological collection of the Academy, with such of the cases 

 as may be required, be appropriated to the use of the joint 

 collection. 



Resolved, That the Zoological Committee be authorized 

 and instructed to carry into effect the foregoing resolutions.

Eleven ribs nearly perfect, seven of which belong to the 

 left side ; one rib of same side much mutilated ; two scapulae 

 imperfect; a humerus, two feet three inches long (French 

 measure) with the head separated from it; three cervical ver- 

 tebrne and six dorsal well preserved ; one lumbar and four 

 caudal vertebrae ; two vertebral spinous processes ; the 

 ossa innominata, fractured, with the acetabula perfect, 

 but the foramina thyroidea incomplete, and the ischia 

 partly broken off; one patella ; the head of the os femoris and 

 upper portion of the shaft of the bone ; a scaphoid and other 

 small bones of the feet ; with numerous undetermined frag- 

 ments of bone. Besides these, there are two others, sup- 

 posed to be the zygomatic processes of the temporal bones. 

 The epiphyses are separated from the upper extremity of the 

 OS humeri and of the femur, which, with the size of the 

 bones, indicate that they belonged to a young animal.

The following remarks by Miss Morris, communicated 



through Professor Johnson, fully explain the circumstances 



which led to, and accompanied the discovery of the larvae 



of Cicada septendeeim preying on the roots of fruit trees : 



I have, for a number of years, believed that the failure of fruit 

 on trees over twenty years old, was mainly owing to the ravages 

 of the larvae of the Cicada scjptendecim, though Entomologists 

 have heretofore considered them harmless, or nearly so, believing 

 that the principal injury caused by them was received on the 

 branches of the trees when depositing their eggs. But from the 

 fact of thfeir burrowing into the earth the moment of their escape 




Dec, 1846.] 133 



from the eggp, and their living, as all acknowledge, on the sap of 

 the roots of plants, I was led to think that the constant drain of 

 sap required to nourish so many thousands of grubs, of from a 

 quarter of an inch to an inch in length, must be more than a tree 

 could live through, and yield good fruit. I was confirmed in this 

 opinion by an experiment made by J. B. W., New York, and 

 published in the November number of the Horticulturist, page 

 227. The method prescribed to renovate an outcast, is to dig a 

 trench four feet wide and twenty inches deep, around the tree, 

 leaving a bail of earth six feet in diameter, and then to fill the 

 trench with rich earth and compost. The author states that the 

 experiment succeeded, and that in three years the tree was in a 

 flourishing condition, and yielded fine fruit. The writer attributes 

 the change to the new and rich soil with which he supplied the 

 tree. I argue, that on cutting off the larvae of the Cicada, which 

 he did when he cut off so large a portion of the roots, he removed 

 the real disease, and the tree was then in a condition to take ad- 

 vantage of the congenial soil placed around it ; and new life was 

 given to roots and branches. 



Under this impression, I superintended a similar experiment on 

 a pear tree that had been declining for years, without any appa- 

 rent cause, and agreeably to my expectations, I found the larvae 

 of the Cicada in countless numbers clinging to the roots of the 

 tree, with their suckers piercing the bark, and so deep and firmly 

 placed, that they remained hanging for half an hour after being 

 removed from the earth. From a root a yard long, and about an 

 incli in diameter, I gathered twenty-three larvae ; they were of 

 various sizes, from a quarter of an inch to an inch in length. 

 They were on all the roots that grew deeper than six inches below 

 the surface. The roots were unhealthy, and bore the appearance 

 of external injury from small punctures. On removing the outer 

 coat of bark, this appearance increased, leaving no doubt as to 

 the cause of the disease. 



The larvae were enclosed in a compact cell of earth, with no 

 outlet except that in immediate contact with the root, and as 

 there were no galleries or holes leading from these cells, I infer 

 that the grubs never leave the roots they first fasten on ; which 

 may account for the great difference of size; the small ones being 

 starved specimens of the same brood : though I am inclined to 

 believe that there are two species, differing sufiiciently in size to ac- 

 count for the discrepancy in the size of the larvae now found. I 

 noticed this difference in 1817, and again in 1834 : the note of 

 the smaller va/iety, or species, is much shriller than that of the 

 larger, and will never be mistaken when noticed. 



The Cicado is too well known to need a description here; I 

 will therefore only notice its habits as they have fallen under my own 

 observation, and make a few extracts from an article published in 



19 




134 [Dec, 1846. 



the National Gazette, and written by my brother, Mr. Thomas 

 W. Morris, in 1834. 



The eggs require forty-two days to niriture in the branches of 

 the trees; they then burst the shell and appear, a minute but 

 active fac simile of the parent in the larva; state, except the ab- 

 sence of the wing cases ; they require but a few moments to 

 stretch their limbs and prepare for labor, before they unloose their 

 hold on the twiggs on which they had been deposited, and fall to 

 the ground, where they immediately disappear in search of food 

 in the roots of the tree. If the eggs that are about to hatch be 

 placed over a glass jar filled with earth, the young grubs will in 

 a few hours after their escape from the eggs, be seen at the bot- 

 tom of the jar endeavoring to force their way still deeper — when 

 first hatched they are quite white, but soon change to yellowish 

 brown. They exist in separate tribes, occupying different sec- 

 tions of country ; making their appearance in different years, but 

 invariably after the same interval of time. For a year or two 

 before the arrival of the main body, a few scattered individuals 

 are generally found. 



Mr. Morris thus describes them, as noticed by him at various 

 times and places : — 



"In November, 1812, I found a large number of locust grubs 

 under an old apple tree, between two and three feet below the 

 surface, having every appearance of such as now issue from the 

 ground, and nearly of the same size. On the 27th of June, 1815, 

 I saw a portion of one of their countless tribes west of the Alle- 

 ghany mountains, extending from the summit of the Chestnut 

 ridge into the State of Ohio, beyond Steubenville ; occupying every 

 shrub and tree except the pines, and the walnut, hickory, and 

 some of the same family. On my return in the latter end of the 

 following month, not an individual of the myriads which had oc- 

 cupied that space was to be seen ; the tops of the forests for up- 

 wards of a hundred miles appeared as if scorched by fire. In 

 1832, just seventeen years after, I noticed a newspaper para- 

 graph, which stated that the locust had appeared in that neigh- 

 borhood in large numbers. 



The northern parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey were 

 visited by them in 1826, when I had another opportunity of see- 

 ing this extraordinary insect. On my way from Easton, through 

 New Jersey to Milford in Pike county, Pennsylvania, I fell in 

 with a very numerous body ; how far they extended, I was unable 

 to learn, but they did not disappear from my route until after 

 passing through a large part of Pike county, a distance by the 

 road, of more than sixty miles from the place where I saw them 

 on the 23d of May. Trees and shrubs are necessary as places of 

 deposit for their eggs ; consequently, though numerous in the 

 State House Square, none were to be found in Washington Square, 

 which in 1817 was destitute of trees."

On the situation of the Olfactory sense in the terrcMrial tribe of 

 the Gasteroj)odous MolUi&ca. 



By Joseph Leidy, M. D. 



While no observer of the habits of the terrestrial Gasteropoda 

 doubts the existence of the sense of smell in them, but on the con- 

 trary, asserts positively that it does esist, the anatomist heretofore 

 has not been able to point out its precise scat. 



Swammerdam, in his Biblia Natura, speaks decidedly of the ex- 

 istence of this sense in the Helix pomatia, but offers no conjec- 

 ture as to its situation. Blumenbach remarks, under the head of 

 Vermes, " Several animals of this class appear to have the sense 

 of smelling, as many land snails (Helix pomatia, &c.,)" and after- 

 wards adds, " But the organ of this sense is hitherto unknown ; 

 perhaps it may be the stigma thoracicum." Cuvier in his Memoir 

 sur la Liniacc et Ic Colimagon, after remarking the delicacy of this 

 sense, thinks it probable it may reside " Dans la pean toute en- 

 tiere, qui a beaucoup texture d'une membrane pituitaire." 



In investigating the anatomy of this tribe of Gasteropodous 

 Mollusca, I detected an organ which appeared to have been en- 

 tirely neglected, or has escaped the notice of those who have dis- 

 sected these animals. It is a depression or cul-de-sac, having its 

 orifice beneath the mouth, between the inferior lip and the ante- 

 rior extremity of tlie podal disk, and which in many species of dif- 

 ferent genera is elongated backwards into a blind duct, more or 

 less deep, occupying a situation just above the podal disk, within 

 the visceral cavity. In Balimus fasciatus it extends backwards 

 as far as the tail, and is several times folded upon itself; in Glandina 

 truncata it extends the length of the podal disk ; in the various species 

 of Helix it is found from a superficial depression to a sac the length 

 of the podal disk; in Succinea obliqua it is of considerable length ; 

 in Limax and Arion it is a superficial depression : in an undeter- 

 mined species of Vaginula, hereafter to be described, I found it 

 half an inch in length, &c. 



It is composed of two laminae; a delicate lining mucous mem- 

 brane and an external layer, having a whitish or reddish glan- 

 dular appearance. A large nerve, on each side, from the suboeso- 

 phageal ganglia, is distributed to its commencement, besides 

 which it receives numerous smaller branches along its course 

 from the same ganglia. Its arterial supply is derived from the 

 cephalic branch of the aorta. 




Dec, 1846.] 137 



This organ, from its situation, relative size to the degree of 

 perfection of the olfactive sfense, as in the carnivorous Glandina 

 truncata, &c., its structure, and nervous supply, I think, is the ol- 

 factory organ.* 



The Committee on Mr. Cassin's communication, read Nov. 

 17, 1846, reported in favor of publication. 



Note on an Instinct prohahly possessed hy the Herons, (Ardea, Linn.) 

 By John Cassin. 



Several years since, I had an opportunity of observing the 

 Great Heron (Ardea Herodias, Linn.) engaged in capturing fishes, 

 and was much surprised at the singular facility with which he 

 struck his prey beneath the surface of the water. This was done 

 almost invariably by striking laterally and obliquely, very rarely 

 vertically or nearly so, as fishes came within reach. 



It appeared to me at that time, and more recent observations 

 have tended to confirm the impression, that this bird, and others 

 which procure food in the same manner, must possess an instinc- 

 tive knowledge of refraction. 



A moment's consideration is sufficient to warrant the inference 

 that this knowledge, if possessed at all, must be instinctive and 

 transmitted from parent to offspring; for it is obvious that if 

 every young bird should be obliged to acquire it, his risk of starv- 

 ing during such apprenticeship would be imminent. 



My observations have not been sufficiently extended to fully 

 justify a conclusion, but I have little doubt that the opinion here 

 expressed is correct, — my object, however, is more especially to 

 ask attention to this remarkable and hitherto unnoticed subject. 



The Monthly Report of the Corresponding Secretary was 

 read and adopted. 



The Annual Report of the Treasurer was read and refer- 

 red to the Auditors. 



The Annual Report of the Librarian was read and adopted. 



• Since writing the above, I have had an opportunity, through 

 the kindness of Mr. Cassin, of examining a specimen of Helix poma- 

 tia, from Europe, in which I find the organ in question existing as a fun- 

 rel-shape depression beneath the mouth, and extending backwards along 

 the podal disk for the distance of three-fourths of an inch. This 1 con- 

 sider particularly interesting, as thesame species has been minutely dis- 

 sected and described by Swammerdam, Cuvier, and others, without any 

 reference whatever to this cul-de-sac.

Letters were read : 



From Richard Brown, Esq,, addressed to the Correspond- 

 ing Secretary, dated Sydney Mines, Nova Scotia, Dec. 9th, 

 1846, acknowledging the receipt of his notice of election as a 

 Correspondent. 



The following extract from this letter is interesting : 



" I have visited Cranberry Head several times recently, and 

 have made a section and drawings of the fossil trees there. The 

 first tree near the Point is based upon a small seam of coal : lately 

 a large piece of the cliff has fallen down, and part of the tree 

 with some of the coal under it. Fortunately it has exposed two 

 long roots — one branching to the North and the other to the 

 South — about seven feet each way. They are very broad and 

 flat, and are genuine Stigmaria. I could not trace any rootlets, 

 but the areolae are not to be mistaken. I have preserved some 

 large pieces, as also some of the bark, of the tree, which is appa- 

 rently an irregularly fluted SigiUaria. 



In a bed of Shale, some twenty feet lower in the section, I have 

 also found several small upright trees, about eight inches diame- 




144 [Jan. 1847- 



ter, filled with soft shale, but having a pith of beautiful bright 

 coal, li inches in diameter, runninj^ up tlie middle: tbo bark is 

 fluted; the roots, long fibres, something like the leaves or rootlets 

 of Stigmaria." 



From Wra. D. Breckenridge, Esq., dated Wasliins^ton, 

 Dec. 29, 1846, returning, with acknowledgments, a collection 

 of ferns from the Berlin gardens, which had been loaned him 

 by permission of the Society for examination and comparison. 



From the Trustees of the Western University of Pennsyl- 

 vania, dated Dec. 9, 1846, referring to the loss by fire lately 

 sustained by that Institution of its entire Museum and Li- 

 brary, and asking for donations towards a renewal of the 

 same, particularly the latter. Referred to the Library Com- 

 mittee.

Descriptions of several new species and one neio genus of Insects, 



By S. S. Haldeman, A. M. 



Blethisa quadricollis. Black, somewhat bronze ; head elon- 

 gate, transversely impressed behind the eyes, which are promi- 

 nent; frontal impressions long and bisinuate, posteriorly connected 

 with the transverse impression ; labrum quadrate, slightly bisinu- 

 ate anteriorly ; antennai steel blue, as long as the head and pro- 

 thorax, four basal articulations glabrous. Prothorax quadrate, 

 bitruncate, wider than the head, slightly rounded on the sides an- 

 teriorly, and very slightly sinuated behind the middle ; posterior 

 angles rounded; margin depressed and reflexed; transverse im- 

 pressions very deep, the anterior one in the arc of a circle ; dorsal 

 line deep, transversely wrinkled, bi-abbreviated ; basal impressions 

 deep, punctured, with an obtuse slightly elevated ridge near the 

 margin. Elytra a little wider than the head, obtusely rounded 

 behind; deeply punctate-striate, strias somewhat interrupted; 

 3d interstice with four or five large fovese ; 5th with three foveas, 

 the anterior one being behind the anterior one of the other range ; 

 6th with two foveas, one below the humerus, and one (sometimes 




150 [Feb., 1847. 



obsolete) towards the apex ; marj;in subcupreous, witli confused 

 ranges of smaller punetures ; legs steel blue; anterior femora 

 with a very slight promiueneo in the female. 7 2 1- long. 3 1. 

 wide. 



Found by Mr. Jo.shua Child upou the Southern shore of Lake 

 Superior. The elytra agree with tho.se in 13. inultipunetuta, Fab. 

 and the thorax apparently with that of B. cseh.scholtzii. 



*CiioiiKA. Body short, robust, and of a rather solid consistency j 

 head small, deflected ; maxillary palpi robust, prominent, last 

 joint largest, and triangular; antennae short, serrate, not sensibly 

 tapered, placed between the eyes and a little removed from them, 

 ■which renders them approximate; they are inserted upon each 

 side of a slight frontal elevation, and arc borne parallel, arched 

 over the thorax and extending a little beyond the scutel. Protho- 

 rax short, transverse, inflated, anterior angles obtusely rounded, 

 posterior ones produced in a sharp angle. Scutel rounded. Ely- 

 tra elongate, texture solid, with wings beneath. Abdomen of five 

 inflated segments. Feet slender, i\\e. posterior coxae very lon<j, be- 

 ing as long as the femur proper, which is much reduced io length, 

 although the limb is of ordinary length. Tarsi with short hair, but 

 scarcely pulvillate; penultiuate articulation bilobed. Probably a 

 female. 



A single individual taken upon the porch of my residence. It 

 endeavored to liberate itself by a sharp click, which, with the shape 

 of the prothorax, led me to suppose it an Elater. The click was 

 produced by approximating the anterior femora along the breast and 

 separating them with a sudden jerk which could be heard and felt. 

 There is nothing apparent in the structure of the anterior feet to 

 indicate this peculiar use of them. 



Chorea py^'-^^'^tor. Dull black, minutely punctured, slightly

 tum covered with piliferous punctures, dorsal line not apparent ; 

 elytra with nine striae filled with large elongate punctures. 4 1.

Eburia diatincta. Flavesccnt, covered with a short ■whitish 

 pubescence ; labrura fringed with fulvous hair ; front imprest ; 

 medial line of the head glabrous posteriorly ; prothorax subcy- 

 lindric, narrowed before, with an anterior and posterior transverse 

 impression ; sides armed with a short spine ; disk on each side, a

 paler from a short pubesceuce ; prothorax subglobular, minutely 

 granulate ; dorsal line slightly impressed posteriorly, a lateral ob- 

 solete impression before the middle towards the exterior margin ,• 

 elytra sparsely and deeply punctured, bi-spinose at tip. 11} 1. long. 

 Greorgia. Distinguished from E. lecontei, Dejean, (^pulverulentum, 

 Fabr., hitherto considered an Elaphidion by me) in having a smaller 

 prothorax, a darker color, and in being less. For the opportunity 

 to describe this and the next species of Longicornia, I am indebted 

 to the kindness of my friend Dr. J. L. Le Conte, in whose cabinet 

 they are.

 flexions : front impressed, antennje, mandibles, labrura, terminal 

 joint of palpi, and scutel, black ; elytra scabrous with confluent 

 punctures ; femora rufous, apex and extreme base, with the tibiae 

 and tarsi, blackish. 6 1. long. Lake Superior. 



Ploiaria maculata. Brown, superior wings pale grey with 

 whitish reticulations, and maculate with brown, darkest towards the 

 base, where there is a long conspicuous triangle with its apex ex- 

 tending to the base ; anterior edge of the wing with a single series 

 of spots, apex with a semicircle of large ones. 2. 1. long. Penn- 

 sylvania, in July. 



The only specimen of this well marked species is imperfect, and 

 although taken several years ago, a second individual has not been 

 seen.

Notice of the discovery of a Cranium of the ZEUaLODON. 

 By M. Tuomey, State Geologist of South Carolina. 



Almost every day adds something to our knowledge of those 

 remarkable forms, which in the revolutions of time have passed 

 out of existence. In 18 — , Dr. Harlan described and figured in 

 the Transactions of the Geological Society of Pennsylvania, some 

 fossil bones from Alabama, consisting of portions of the upper and 

 lower maxillae of an animal under the name of " Basilosaurus," 

 from an impression that they belonged to a gigantic Saurian. An 

 examination of the teeth, however, satisfied Professor Owen that 

 these remains belonged to a Cetacean, to which he has given the 

 name " Zeuglodon." 



The first description of an entire tooth of this animal, was given 

 by Mr. Buckley, in a concise account of the discovery of a consi- 

 derable portion of the skeleton, published in the American Journal 

 of Science in 1843. In 1845, Dr. R. W. Gibbes, of South Carolina, 

 published in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences 




152 [Feb., 1847. 



of Philadelphia, accurate fijrurcs of similar teeth with fragments 

 of the lower maxilla. The teeth boiug hollow, and. in his opinion 

 presenting other important diflForences, he constituted for them a 

 new genus, " Dorudon." 



The " Hydrarchos," I believe, has passed away without advancing 

 our knowledge upon this interesting subject, excepting perhaps that' 

 Prof. Wymaii discovered iu the extremity of the ribs some ceta- 

 cean cliaracters. 



The next important development consisted in the publication by 

 Professor Kmmons, in the American Quarterly Journal of Agricul- 

 ture, beautiful figures of the teeth, anterior portion of lower max- 

 illae, together with a portion of the ramus having the corouoid pro- 

 cess and condyle almost perfect, cervical and caudal vertebrae^ and 

 a rib. But up to the present time, no notice has appeared of the 

 discovery of any considerable portion of the cranium proper — for 

 the mutilated head of the so called Hydrarchos can scarcely be con- 

 sidered an exception. 



Early in January I was presented by F. S. Holmes, Esq., with 

 a portion of the left upper maxilla, containing one tooth and the 

 alveolse of several others, which he discovered in the Eocene beds 

 of Ashley river, about ten miles from Charleston. Soon after, Prof. 

 Lewis R. Gibbes, of the College of Charleston, visited the same lo- 

 cality, and had the good fortune to find the rest of the scull, much 

 fractured, but so carefully were the fragments collected, that with 

 a little patience we were enabled to restore them to their proper 

 places. It is then altogether to these gentlemen that we owe a 

 knowledge of this valuable fc ssil. 



Description. Occipital bone somewhat semicircular, transversely 

 flat or slightly concave, central portion thin ; a crest like ridge sur- 

 rounds the superior portion terminating in the suture with the tem- 

 poral bone. Condyles two, articulating surfaces lunate, and almost 

 enclosing the foramen magnum. Foramen magnum oval ; trans- 

 verse diameter 11 inches, vertical diameter 1 inch; transverse pro- 

 cesses thick, spreading, making the breadth of the base of the cra- 

 nium equal to its diameter across the zygomatic processes ; jugular 

 foramen i inch in diameter ; temporal bones small, mastoroid por- 

 tion thick and strong but not prominent ; articulating cavities for 

 condyles of lower maxillae large, forming about 30° of a circle, in- 

 clining inwards and backwards; maxillae thick and strong, vertical 

 section triangular; a cavity for nerves and vessels runs within at 

 the points of the roots of the teeth ; alveolar process thick ; palatal 

 bone strong, anteriorly emarginate and horizontal, posteriorly de- 

 scending below the alveolar process. 



Frontal bone and anterior portion of maxilla; wanting; walls of 

 the nasal canal smooth ; sutures squamous ; in the left maxilla one 

 tooth remains, which is solid, spear-shaped, edges coarsely ser- 

 rate, exterior side flattened, interior side convex ; agreeing in this 

 respect with the position of the teeth in the shark ; roots double,

nearly parallel, and inserted obliquely backwards; in the right 

 maxilla are the alveolae for eight teeth with double roots. In the 

 solidity of the teeth and slight divergency of the roots, this speci- 

 men agrees with the figures of Dr. Harlan and Prof. Emmons. 



This fossil is particularly interesting, as it removes every doubt, 

 if any remain, of the true character of the animal to which it be- 

 longed. The double occipital condyle shows it to have been a 

 mammal, while the squamous sutures and a symmetrical form refer 

 it to the Cetaceae.

Geological position. The teeth described by Dr. Gibbes were 

 found in the oldest of the calcareous beds of the Eocene of South 

 Carolina, which contain Gardita planicosfa and other well known 

 Eocene fossils, together with Grt/phea mutuhilis and Terehratula 

 harJani, which are also common to the cretaceous formation. And 

 the fossil just described was found in upper beds of the Eocene so 

 that the Zeuglodon must have existed through the whole of the 

 Eocene period; a period which, in South Carolina, was at least 

 sufficiently long for the deposition of three hundred feet of calca- 

 reous and sedimentary matter; a fact which was ascertained by 

 boring at Charleston. ,

Remarks oti the Birds observed in Upper California. 

 By William Gambkl. 



(Oiutinucd from page, 110.) 



PASSERES. 

 Genus *CHAM-«A.t 



Bill short, tapering to the point, acute and compressed. Both mandibles 

 entire, ridge of upper elevated, and curving nearly from the base ; the de- 

 pression for the nostrils large, oval, and exposed ; the nostrils opening be- 

 neath a niembraue in the depression. Wings very short and much rounded. 

 Tail very long and graduated. Tarsus long. 



Chameea fasciata, Nobis. Ground Tit. 



Parus fdsciatus, nobis, Proceed. Acad. Nat. Sc, vol. 2, p. 26.5, 



This interesting bird, placed provisionally among the Titmice, I have noTV 

 made the type of a new genus, not being able, as yet, to find a suitable place 

 for it, among those already described. 



For several months before discovering the bird, I chased among the fields 

 of dead mustard staliis, the weedy margins of streams, low thickets and 

 bushy places, a continued, loud, crepitant, grating scold, which I took for 

 that of some species of wren, but at last found to proceed from this Wren- 

 Tit, if it might so be called. It is always difficult to be seen, and keeps in 

 such places as 1 have described, close to the ground; eluding pursuit, by 

 diving into the thickest bunches of weeds and tall grass, or tangled bushes, 

 uttering its grating wren-like note whenever an approach is made towards it. 



But if quietly watched, it may be seen, when searching for insects, to 

 mount the twigs and dried stalks of grass sideways, jerking its long tail, and 

 keeping it erect like a wren, which, with its short wings, in such a position 

 it so much resembles. At the same time uttering a very slow, monotonous, 

 singing, chickadee note,like pee pee pee j)ee peep ; at other times iis notes are 

 varied, and a slow whistling, continueipwit, pivit, pwit, pwit,pwi(, pwit, may 

 be heard. Again, in pleasant weather towards spring, I have heard them 

 answering one another, sitting upon a low twig, and singing in a less solemn 

 strain, not unlike a sparrow, a \iveljpit,pit,pit, tr r r r r r r r, but if dis- 

 turbed, at once resumining their grating scold. 



Parus inornaius, Nobis. Plain Titmouse. Proceed. Acad. Nat. Sc, vol. 

 2, p. 265. 



The Plain Titmouse I first discovered near Monterey on the 20th of 

 November. It was actively flitting about among'the evergreen oaks of the 

 vicinity, in company with large flocks of the Chestnut-backed and Least 

 Titmouse, all in restless activity, searching every branch for insects. 



Among the busy throng I could not well distinguish its notes, but they 

 appeared to resemble very much those of the common Black-cap, and on 

 mv following it up, uttered a loud scold, erecting its high and pointed crest, 

 and looking as angry as possible at the intrusion. 



■j- From x^^f^'^'i ^^ ^^^ ground. 




Feb., 1847.] 155 



I afterwards found it common, frequenting in small flocks tall bushes and 

 branches of small trees, uttering a weak and slender tsee day day, tsee day 

 day dait. 



Parus montaims, Nobis. Rocky Mountain Titmouse. Proceed. Acad- 

 Nat. Sc, vol. 1, p. 259. 



I have already stated all that I know of this new and handsome species, in 

 the description contained in the number of the Proceedings above referred to. 

 It was exceedingly abundant in the western ranges of the Piocky Moun- 

 tains, particularly in the high ridges near the great salt lake, in the wooded 

 portions of which they were roaming in large flocks, and from thence to the 

 Galifornian ridge, on the other side of which I never saw them. In habits, 

 as well as appearance, it resembles very much the P. atricapillus, but is at 

 once distinguished by the two white lines, running over the top of the head 

 to the occiput. 



Parus riifescens^ Towns. Chestnut-backed Titmouse. 

 In the latter part of summer and during the winter season, the young of 

 this species are found around Monterey in large flocks. 

 Parus minimus, Towns. Least Titmouse. 



This interesting and most diminutive bird, is exceedingly abundant in 

 the Rocky Mountains and California. During winter, the otherwise cheer- 

 less woods, are alive with busy, noisy troops of these industrious birds, 

 gleaning their scanty fare in company with the Ruby-crowned Kinglet, in 

 every possible manner and position from bush or tree. 



It is curious to watch them in this anxious solicitous search for food, keep- 

 ing up a continual twittering; so intent are they in their employment, that 

 they appear to lose sight of danger, and often have I been so surrounded 

 by a flock, that I could have almost caught them in my hands. 



The above additional species, together with the P. septentrionalis, recently 

 described by my friend Mr. Edward Harris, in the Proceedings of the Aca- 

 demy, have increased the number of North American Titmice, exclusive of 

 the Ground Tit, to nine species. 



Trichas Marylandica. Maryland Yellow Throat. 



This species, distributed throughout the whole of North America is com- 

 mon, both in the Rocky Mountains and California. 



Vermivora cclata, Say. Orange-crowned Warbler. 



Flocks of this species are common during winter in Upper California, 

 frequenting low bushes and margins of streams. On the Island of Santa 

 Catalina in early spring I heard its simple though lively song, commencing 

 in a loud sweet shrill and ending tsh^ up, sometimes considerably varied, 

 but.generally er r r r r r tsM up. 



Sylvicola Auduboni, Towns. Audubon's Warbler. 



This handsome warbler is abundant throughout the West. I first ob- 

 served it in New Mexico, thence through the ranges of the Rocky Mountains 

 to California, where, particularly during winter, the young birds are found 

 in large flocks, and generally in the tops of trees. Its habits as well as 




156 [Feb., 1847. 



appearance they resemMe the Yellow Rump, S. coronala, and like them 

 also, diiplay a great deal of familiarity, entering the towns, and resorting 

 to gardens and fence rows, and even the corals of the houses ; frequently 

 also, descending to the ground with the Blackbirds and Sparrows. 



Sylvania pnsilla. Wils. (Nutt.) Green Black-capped Flycatcher. 



Myiodi/oitcs WiUonii, Aud. 



This pretty little Sylvan Flycatcher is common both in the Rocky Moun- 

 tains and California. 



Culicivora cccriilia, Lath. Blue-grey Flycatcher. 



Abundant in Upper California. 



Tyrannula pnsilla. Swains. Little Pewee Flycatcher. 



I observed this species to be plentiful about the Pueblo delos Angeles in 

 .Upper California, where most probably they breed. During the month of 

 April, it frei-iueuted the hedges of vineyards and neighboring trees, uttering 

 a sweet and considerably varied song. The following description of an 

 adult killed there in the spring, may be useful, to show that it is the same 

 bird as that described by Swainson in the Arctic Zoology, and that found 

 in Labrador by Audubon. Above greenish olive; wings and tail dusky 

 brown, the coverts tipped with dull white, forming two bands on the wing; 

 the tertiaries also broadly edged with the same. Below yellowish, brightest 

 on the lower part of the throat and breast, and on the abdomen. Feet and 

 legs bright lead-blue. A yellowish ring around the eye. Upper mandible 

 black, the lower pale flesh colored ; inside of both, orange. Tail even, 2i 

 inches ; wings 21 inches. Tarsus |. Bill along ridge about g, from angle 

 of mouth |. Total length 5 inches. First quill a little shorter than the 

 Cth : 3rd and 4th nearly equal. The bird has a conspicuous crest. 



Tyrannula Saya, Bonap. Black-tailed Flycatcher. 



T. pallida, Swans. Syn. Bds. of Mexico. 



This species, common throughout the western regions of our country, ie 

 particularly so in California and the northern provinces of Mexico. Its 

 manners much resemble those of the common Pewee, frequenting the neigh- 

 borhood of towns, weedy hill sides and plains, darting from twig to twig 

 after passing insects, jerking its tail, and merely uttering a single weak and 

 singing chip, or an occasional guttural twitter, but very different from the 

 harsh angry ishij) of the T. nigricans, with which it 'u so often associated. 

 It breeds in California, and no doubt like its dark companion, about the 

 houses and Missions, but I did not find its nest. 



Tyrannula niyricans, Swains. Black Pewee. 



This bird is abundant in California, and like our common Pewee is particu- 

 larly fond of being near the habitations of man: with the utmost confidence, it 

 is seen familiarly flying about the corals and gardens,and even the very doors; 

 over which, on a projecting beam, about the middle of April, I found its nest. 

 It was large for the size of the bird, and consisted of a solid round mason work 




Feb. 1847.] 157 



of clay, intermixed with fibres of grass, kc, and lined with a thin layer of 

 softer materials, blades of grass, fine strips of bark from the neighboring 

 vineyard, and horsehair, and contained four eggs. This was the second 

 nest which had been built that year; the first near the same place having 

 been destroyed by the occupant of the house, this was commenced still 

 nearer the door. I was informed that it was difficult to get them to leave 

 the place they had once selected for their nest, and that if it were torn down 

 they would at once commence forming another. The previous year three 

 successive nests had been destroyed. These birds are constant residents: 

 and, as well as near the towns, are also distributed over the whole country, 

 either in the margins of woods, or bushy plains, and almost always in pairs. 

 They are very pugnacious, and are often seen fighting together in the air, 

 »nd darting afcer each other from branch to branch, at the same time ut- 

 ring their peculiar loud and angry tship, which can always be recognized. 

 From the arrangement of its colors, at a little distance, when sitting with 

 their breasts towards you, they are easily mistaken for Snow birds. 

 Tyrannus borealis, Swains. Olive-sided Flycatcher. 

 T. Cooperii, Nutt. 



I found this species scatteringly in the Rocky Mountains : it is quite 



abundant in the Pine woods of Upper California, for which it appears to 



have a great partiality. In the latter part of July I killed the young, not 



yet fully fledged, in the pines near Monterey, where they must have bred. 



Tyrannus veriicalis, Say. Arkansas Flycatcher. 



This tyrant is an abundant resident in California. Around the Pueblo 

 de los Angeles it takes possession of the hedges of the vineyards, orchards 

 and gardens ; noisy, pugnacious, and ever on the alert, it suffers no intru- 

 sion upon its dominions ; Hawk, Raven, or Crow, not even its own species, 

 are allowed to pass unmolested. For this reason it has acquired the name 

 of Correaierbo (Crow-chaser) by the inhabitants, who also gladly allow 

 them full possession. 

 Tyrannus crinitus ? 



A large species of Flycatcher, very much resembling the Great Crested, 

 is not uncommon in Cilifornia. My friend S. F. Baird, of Carlisle, Pa., is 

 in possession of a specimen, and considering- it distinct, it will soon be 

 published in a paper he has prepared, upon the North American birds of 

 this family. Near Monterey I have heard it uttering the payiip note of the 

 Great Crested, and at Santa Barbara they were breeding in the knot holee 

 of the evergreen oaks in May. 



Ptilogonys Tou-nsendii, Aud. Townsend's Ptilogonjs. 

 This rare bird I frequently found in the Rocky Mountains of the interior 

 of California. See Proceedings of the Academy for April, 1843. 

 Icteria viridis, Gmel. Yellow-breasted Chat. 



The Chat arrives in California about the middle of April, and resorts to 

 the hedges of vineyards, gardens and bushy places, where no doubt it breeds. 



22 




158 [Feb. 1847. 



It is very extensively distributed on our continent, as I observed it also 

 common along the coast of I'eru. 



Vireo solilarius, Vieill. Solitary Vireo. 



During the latter part of summer and winter, the young birds of this 

 species are abundant, frequenting low bushes and thickets, in small flocks.

March, 184T.] 185 



The following communication was read from Messrs. 

 Aaron Sharpless and William Kite, of Chester country, Penn- 

 sylvania, dated 2d mo. 18th, 1847, in reference to the living 

 Hybrids between the Guinea fowl and the turkey, lately pre- 

 sented by them to the Society. 



" The mother was a common Guinea fowl, the survivor of 

 two or three chicks hatched under a common hen two years ago 

 from eggs presented to us. From constantly associating with 

 the poultry, and having none of her own species for companions, 

 she was rather unusually domestic. 



The father was a common turkey cock, the reputed father of 

 our flock of turkeys, having nothing very remarkable in his 

 habits 



Last spring the hen having arrived at maturity, was observed 

 to drop one or two eggs, as though preparing for incubation. 

 Supposing them to lack vitality, we procured a cock of the same 

 species from a neighbor, and confined them together in a coop 

 for a few days. On releasing them, the new comer remained for 

 some days and then disappeared. Supposing our object to have 

 been accomplished, the hen was now suffered to form her nest in 

 peace, which she did, laying twenty-two eggs, differing in no re- 

 spect that we can now remember, either in size or colour from 

 common. 



When within a few days of maturing these eggs, her nest was 

 broken up by an opossum, which destroyed nearly all of ihem ; 

 she however gathered the remnant together and brought off three 

 chicks : the surviving two are those now in the possession of the 

 Academy ; discovering the hybridity of these, we have much re- 

 gretted the loss of the rest of the brood. 



As the chicks advanced toward maturity, "they began to excite 

 our attention by peculiarities which induced us to suspect their 

 hybridity. The young of the guinea fowl assume the colour of 

 the adult, but these always had the rusty brown tinge on their 

 plumage which now marks them. They never were able to com- 

 pass the note of their mother so familiar to our boyish reminis- 

 cence, but always ran into a cracked or falsetto key, which seem- 

 ed laboured. They were quiet birds, differing ia this from 

 the guinea, whose clamor is so disagreeable in the poultry 




186 March, 1847.] 



yard as to induce many persons to discard them. In the Cgure 

 of these birds, their heaJs, and the size and appearance of 

 their legs and feet, there is a greater resemblance to the turkey 

 than to the dung-hill fowl, the only other bird a cross like the 

 present could be traced to. One habit they had peculiar to 

 the turkey, that of erecting the feathers on the back of the neck. 

 The plumage of these birds also partakes somewhat of the pecu- 

 liarities of that of the turkey, though curiously blended with 

 that of the pintado. 



In a poultry yard we always find the guinea fowls masters 

 of the place, in which peculiarity our hen nliared, boldly attack- 

 ing any who offended her, and readily putting the cocks to flight. 

 This latter circumstance seems to negative the probability of the 

 cross we are examining being with the latter fowl. 



We consider ourselves further confirmed in supposing the 

 turkey before alluded to, to be the father of these hybirds, from 

 the face that he was the only male turkey then in the poultry 

 yard, and very close attentions were noticed between him and 

 the hen, which were fully reciprocated on her part, though the 

 act of sexual intercourse escaped our observation." 



Professor Johnson offered some observations on the cellu- 

 lose of the Borneo Palm, and its reaction with Nitric and 

 Sulphuric acids, bywhich it was apparently converted into 

 Zyloidine, and not into Pjroxiline. 



The Curators exhibited a mass of minute black insects, 

 (Acari ?) which had been received from the Rev. James H. 

 McFarland, of Reading, Pa., by whom they had been collected 

 on the Broad mountain, "near the Summit Coal mines, Schuyl- 

 kill county, Pa, on the 28th of December last. The snow for a 

 quarter of a mile along the road was covered to blackness 

 with these insects, and heaps from which a peck could have 

 been collected, were frequent on the road. The day was 

 warm for the season. A few more were obtained on a sub- 

 sequent day, during a fall of snow. 




March, 1847.] 18T 



The Curators having announced that a National Medical 

 Convention -was to assemble in this city in the early part of 

 May next, it was on motion, 



Resolved, That the Curators be authorized to tender to the 

 delegates from the city and county of Philadelphia to the 

 National Medical Convention, the use of the Hall of the 

 Academy during the session of the Convention. 



Also, on motion, Resolved, That the Library Committee, 

 in conjunction with the Librarian, be instructed to devise 

 plans for book cases in the new Library and Meeting room, 

 and report the same at the next meeting of the Society.

A letter was read from Miss Morris, dated Gcrmantown, 

 March 5th, 1847, addressed to the Corresponding Secretary, 

 containing the following in relation to the larvae of Cicada 

 septemdecim, presented this evening. 



" I send with this a box containing the larvae of the Cicada 

 which I promised, and believe you will find them satisfactory 

 evidence of the truth of my theory; they were found on the 

 roots of a pear tree, which I had under examination this morning 

 in company with between four and five hundred, which I gathered 

 while the earth was being removed from a trench four feet wide 

 and two deep that was dug around the tree. This experiment 

 was in every way satisfactory, and proved beyond a doubt the 

 correctness of my former observations.* My only surprise was 

 that the tree had lived so long. I then removed the earth from a 

 tree, distant about twelve feet. A quantity of earth and rubbish 

 had been thrown around this tree, some years since, in conse- 

 quence of which, the tree had produced a fresh and vigorous set 

 of roots above those attacked by the Cicada ; passing below these, 

 about two feet, I found the larvae in great numbers, but from the 

 difficulty of getting at them, I believed the remedy would prove 

 worse than the disease; so covering them up with fresh earth and 

 manure I left the tree to its fate. I then went to a distant part of 

 the garden, and caused the roots of another tree to be exposed, 

 but to my surprise, found but few Cicada, not more than a dozen. 

 This tree had long ceased to bear fruit, and had become withered 

 and diied, several years before any other tree appeared to suffer, 

 but in 1845 it again showed signs of returning life, though no 

 care had been bestowed to restore it ; and in the following year it 

 threw out several fine and vigorous shoots from the branches. 

 On a little further search I found the remedy, as well as the dis- 

 ease, at the root. Mole tracks were to be seen in every direction 

 around the tree and in that portion of the garden. I then ex- 

 amined four other trees, and found that where the mole tracks 



*See No. 6, page 132. 




March, 1847.] 191 



were to be found, the Cicada had nearly disappeared, while they 

 abounded where the moles had not been. Many larvae of the 

 Scarites Icevigatus were found, no doubt doing their full share 

 to rid us of so great an evil." 



Dr. Leidy, from the Curators, read a letter from Dr. J. K. 

 Mitchell, Chairman of a committee of the delegation from the 

 city and county of Philadelphia to the National Medical 

 Convention, returning acknowledgments to the Academy for 

 the offer of its Hall for the use of the Convention, and accept- 

 ing the same. 



The Corresponding Secretary read a letter from Judge 

 Tremper, dated Dresden, N. Y., March 8, 1847, containing 

 some Meteorological observations. 



Professor Johnson communicated some observations and experi- 

 ments on the dust of anthracite furnace flues. Having several 

 years since ascertained the presence of large quantities of salts of 

 ammonia, both sulphates and chlorides, in flues and stove pipes 

 where anthracite is consumed, he had recently directed attention 

 to this as a source from which a moderate supply of these salts 

 for the uses of horticulture may readily be obtained. It was 

 therefore deemed worthy of a trial to ascertain in what proportion 

 the salts soluble in water might occur in the dust of a flue, such 

 as ordinary practice iu domestic use would afford. For this pur- 

 pose, one pound of the dry dust was heated with successive por- 

 tions of distilled water until the liquid ceased to be coloured, or to 

 give a saline residuum on complete evaporation. The liquid 

 was of a dark brown colour, and on analysis afi'orded.

A letter was read from the Rev. Dr. Thomas S. Savage, 

 dated Cape Palmas, Western Africa, January 1, 1847, ac- 

 knowledging the receipt of his notice of election as Corres- 

 pondent. 



Dr. Leidy mentioned, as a remarkable instance of the great 

 fecundity of the Cryptogamia, that in a puff-ball (Lycoper- 

 don) of large size, he counted under the microscope 27 

 sporules in the cubic hundredth of a line, which by calcula- 

 tion, allowing for cellular tissue, makes the total amount con- 

 tained in the specimen, 1,007,669,000,000. 



On motion of Prof. Johnson, Resolved. That a committee 

 be appointed to inquire into the conditions of the bequest of 

 the late William S. Warder, Esq., to this Institution, and 

 to ascertain whether the conditions on which said bequest 

 was made, have not been so for realized that the Academy 

 may be justly entitled to receive the benefit intended by the 

 testator. 



Messrs. Johnson, Pearsall and Carpenter were then ap- 

 pointed the Committee.

Dr. Leidy communicated an observation which he had 

 made in the human adult subject, of the existence of a spicu- 

 lum of bone developed between the lamina of the dura 

 mater, just over the point at which the trigeminus nerve 

 pierces that membrane, the purpose of which he supposes to 

 be, to protect the nerve from pressure as it passes over the 

 superior edge of the petrous portions of the temporal bone to 

 join the Casserian ganglion. 



Mr. Phillips offered the following, which was adopted ; 



Resolved, That a copy of the Journal of the Academy, as

Genua Cymindis, Cuvier. 



Cymindis Wilsonii, Nobis. J . Body above entirely dark brown, palest 

 on the head, beneath white ; every feather from chin to under tail coverts 

 crossed by several bars of bright rufous chesnut, and these colours extending 

 upwards into a collar around the neck; fourth, fifth aiid sixth primaries longest 

 and nearly equal, external webs nearly black, internal webs of outer primaries 

 white at base and for nearly half their length, the remaining part reddish in- 

 clining to chesnut, every primary (oil its inner web) having two irregularly 

 shaped black marks and tipped with black. Tail of the same colour as the 

 back but paler, white at base, and crossed by about four broad bars which are 

 nearly black, the second bar from the tip accompanied by a narrow rather in- 

 distinct bar of rufous ; tip of tail narrowly edged with white. Bill very large, 

 (larger than in any other species of this genus,) yellowish white, inclining to 

 bluish horn colour at base. 



$ . Body above entirely slate colour, palest onjthfe head, beneath barred with 

 the same, the bars having a ferruginous tinge. 



Total length of mounted specimen, from tip Of bill to end of tail, 17 inches; 



tiab. Island of Cuba. 



The two specimens here described, were presented to the Academy by its 

 esteemed member, Richard C. Taylor, Esq., the eminent Geologist, who has 

 kindly favoured me with the following note and memorandum from hla 

 journal : 



Philadelphia, April 5th, 1847. 



Dear Sih: I make the best reply in my power respecting the pair of Hawks, 

 the skins of which and of other birds were brought by me from the Island of 

 Cuba ; but not being an Ornithologist, the very concise description that I cafl 

 give of them may not be very intelligible nor useful. 



The locality was towards the north-eastern part of the island, in the'vicinitjr 

 of the port of Gibara, in the province of Holguin. The range of country mora 

 especially traversed by me, during six months residence, extended from the sea 

 coast to thirty miles inland, either into the savanna, or copper region of the 

 mountains. I have particularly described this country in the Transactions of 

 the Am. Phil. Society, vol. ix., pp. 204 to 218, where I have also given a re- 

 connoisance map. 



My journal contains a short note, made at the time these hawks were shot. 

 My companion and myself saw this pair in company, hovering over the crest 



28 




200 [Ai'RiL, 1847. 



of the high limestone mountain called La SilU, about eeveu miles from the 

 coast : my attention was called to them by my companion, a resident of the 

 island, who assured me they were extreraly rare, and he hoped we should be 

 able to shoot them ; we were then on the peak of ihe mountain, and after a 

 little chase, were so fortunate as to obtain both the male and female. My note 

 is literally as follows: 



" Gabilanazul, blue hawk of the Spaniards, male and female, very rare and 

 diflScult to shoot. Pupil black, with a greenish-yellow iris." 



The food of these birds was stated to be various birds, of which doves were 

 the most abundant on the spot, with perhaps an occasional relish of lizards, 

 which were also abundant. I understood that these hawks frequented the 

 most lofty and solitary peaks and were not often seen below. We considered 

 ourselves extremely fortunate in the acquisition of this fine pair of birds. 

 Respectfully yours, Richard C. Tatlor. 



Mr. John Cassin. 



The bill in this species is very large in proportion to the size of the bird, and 

 it agrees, moreover, tolerably well with the urilten description of Falco magni- 

 rostrie, Gmelin, — so does the young Cymindis uncanitus, Illig. All authors, 

 however, except Dr. Latham, clearly understood the F. magnirostris to bo 

 the bird figured in Enl. 464, which is a common South American species of 

 the genus Astur. 



Dr. Latham, in his article on F. magnirostris, Gen. His. vol. 1, p. 282, gives a 

 description of a bird suspected by him to be the species intended by Gmelin, 

 ■which applies very well to Cymindis cayanensis, Gm. , in young plumage, but 

 not to C. Wilsonii. 



I have named this species in honor of Dr. Thomas B. Wilson, as a slight 

 tribute to his merits as a man, and his munificence as a patron of Zoological 

 science.

PASSERES. '* 



Laniua Ludovicianus, Linn. Loggerhead Shrike. 



L. excubitoroides, Swains. Northern Zool. p. 115, pi. 34. 



In the Shrikes we are presented with a group of birds closely allied to each 

 other, and undergoing such changes in plumage as renders them difficult to 

 diBcriminate. Although examined with great care by Swainson in the Fauna 




April, 1847.] .201 



Boreali-Americana, yet he appears to have laid too much stress upon char- 

 acters subject to great variation, as size, relative length of quills and color. 



The adult of the Loggerhead is a beautiful bird, and might well have been 

 called excubitoroides, for the resemblance in colour and marking to the Euro- 

 pean ercubitor is very great. Above, it is of a clear pearl grey colour with the 

 upper tail coverts, and exterior edges of the scapulars, nearly pure white; be- 

 neath pure white ; the quantity of white on the tail feathers varies, but gene- 

 rally is in proportion to the age of the bird. 



The relative length of quills in the Shrilies is an uncertain cTiaracter, and 

 differs very much according to age. In the young of this species, the second 

 quill is generally much shorter than the sixth, but in the adalt, equals and may 

 even exceed the sixth in length; the proportion of the third, fourth and fifth to 

 each other is also exceedingly various, and indeed in each wing of the same 

 bird it is very common to find the proportion of the quills differing very mate- 

 rially. This I have found to be the case in the European and both American 

 species. 



It is rather strange that this bird so abundant in the southern, western and 

 north western portions of our country, should not be found in the middle and 

 northern Atlantic States. In California it is very common. 



Lanius septentrionalis. Gmel. Northern Shrilie. 



L. horealis, Vieill. Swains. 



I found our Butcher Bird in the Californian ridge of mountains in Novem- 

 ber, but did not meet with it along the coast during summer, appearing to be 

 replaced by the Loggerhead, which is a summer resident. 



Perisoreus Canadensis, (Linn.) Bonap. Canada Jay. 



We met with numbers of this plain and familiar bird in the Rocky moun- 

 tains of the interior. 



Cyanocoraz Stelleri. (Pallas) Bonap. Steller's Jay. 



This species is occasionally met with in the pine groves of the mountains 

 from New Mexico to California. 



Cyanocoraz Californkus, (Vigors) Nobis. California Jay. 



Garrulus Californkus, Vigors, Zool. Beechy's voyage. 



G. ultramarinus, Aud, Nutt. non Bonap. 

 The California Jay has been hitherto confounded by American ornithologists 

 with the Mexican G. ultramarinus, accurately described by Prince Bonaparte, 

 in the Journal of this Society, in 1825, and afterwards described and figured 

 also, by Temminck in his Planches colorees, 439. It is strange that the 

 Prince himself should have committed the same error of confoundiug the two 

 species in his Comparative list of the Birds of Europe and North America, 

 quoting at the same time Audubon's place and description, which is clearly 

 the Californkus. 




202 [April, 1847. 



The distinctions between the two species arc very considerable, and may be 

 thns stated.

Tarsus 1| inches. Tarsus 1^ inches. 



The C. ultramarinus by its greater size, blue colour above, and absence of 

 pectoral band, together with its very different proportion, is easily distin- 

 guished from the C. Calif ornicui,yih\ch is much smaller, has a brown back, 

 p, white superciliary line, and a dull white throat, and breast surrounded by 

 a collar of blue. 



The G. sordidus, Swains. (Syn. Bds. Mex.) generally quoted as a synonym 

 of the uUramarimts, dose not agree verj'' well with it, unless the description 

 were taken from a young bird, in which the tail is irregularly rounded, and 

 the size somewhat less. 



The California Jay is a very abundant species, and a constant resident. 

 Jn its actions it is exceedingly restless, and at the same time sprightly and 

 graceful, ever flitting from tree to tree, uttering a harsh grating/ay, /ay, and 

 sometimes altering it to kay ic, kay ic. Like all the Jays, they are very fond 

 of scolding, and a troop of them will surround and follow almost any object 

 that attracts their attention, with their teasing disagreeable cries. 



Pica Hudsonica (Sabine) Bonap. Common Magpie. 



We frequently met with the Magpie on our route from New Mexico to Cali- 

 fornia. It would linger around our camp to pick up the offal, and sometimes 

 boldly steal the meat which was hung on the bushes around. 

 Pica Niittalii^ Aud. Nuttall's Magpie. 



I felt great pleasure on arrivingat Santa Barbara,in Upper California, in see- 

 ing in its native haunts, this distinct and beautiful Magpie, discovered by my 

 friend, the indefatigable naturalist and traveller after whom it is named ; 




April, 1847.] 203 



among others, a just tribute for the invaluable services he has rendered to 

 natural science, during more than thirty years of his life, spent among us, 

 in untiring investigation of the productions of our country. 



In California, at least, and where as yet I believe it has alone been found, 

 this Magpie is exceedingly local, being confined, as far as I have observed, to 

 the immediate neighborhood of Santa Barbara, where among the beautiful 

 evergreen oaks (Quercus agrifolia) of the vicinity, it is abundant. 



Sprightly and graceful in its movements, it is a favorite with the inhabitants; 

 and when not molested shows considerable confidence, often being seen about 

 the doors of the houses, but becoming remarkably shy and cautious when 

 chased or shot at. During my stay, from frequently shooting at them, although 

 at first they were numerous in small fiocks, they at length became so scarce 

 that during the breeding season very few were to be seen, apparently having 

 gone to the ravines of the neighboring mountains, so that I did not find a sin- 

 gle recent nest, although the woods were full of those of the last year. The 

 old nests were large, and built loosely of sticks like that of a crow, and situat- 

 ed in the topmost forks of the trees, well concealed by the foliage. 



Corvus ossifragus, Wils. Fish Crow. 



Abundant along the Pacific coast. 



Corvus Americanus, Aud. Common Crow. 



Also abundant throughout the Pacific coast, as well as in the interior. 



Corvus catatotl, Wagler. American Raven. 



Fitted by its organization for any means of subsistence, there are few parts 

 of North America where the Raven may not be found. 



In the arid region between the Rio Colorado and California, its ominous 

 croak renders the desert solitude more dismal, and on the rocky uninhabited 

 Islands off the coast of California, it is the companion of the Fish-hawk and 

 Gulls; but in California, instead of being scattered and solitary, it becomes 

 one of the most abundant and familiar of birds, and in company with its 

 fellow-scavengers, the Turkey vultures and dogs, it is exceedingly useful in 

 consuming the refuse of the cattle which are slaughtered in such great num- 

 bers. At the Pueblo de los Angeles, so abundant were they in and around 

 the town, that I have counted ic the corral, or court yard of a single house, 

 as many as 150 at one time. 



Nucifraga Columbiana, (Wils.) Aud. American Nutcracker. 

 "We occasionally met with this peculiar bird in the mountains of the interior, 

 among the scattered pine groves. 



Quiscalus majors, Vieill. Boat-tailed Blackbird. 



This large and handsome blackbird is very abundant about the Gulf, and 

 occasionally is seen as far north as Upper California. 

 Scolcophagusferrugincus, (Wils.) Eire. Rusty Blackbird. 

 We found this species very common in New Mexico and California, as also 




204 [April, 1847. 



the S. Meiirnnm, Swains, lately described and figured by Audubon as 

 Quiscaltts Jircweri. 



Sturnella neglccta, Aud. Western Meadow Lark. 

 This nearly allied species we found a bundant on the prairies in N'cw Mexico, 

 Rio Colorado, and California. In the s|)ring around the Pueblo de los Angeles 

 its delicate and melodious song was every where to be heard. About Monte- 

 rey in the winter it kept in and along the margins of the pine woods. 



Molothrus pecorus, (Grael.) Swains. Cow Blackbird. 



Abundant, in company with the Rusty Blackbird, frequenting, in flocks, 

 the cattle corrals and farm houses of New Mexico and California. 



Icterus bullockii, Swains. Bullock's Oriole. 



The males of this beautiful bird arriveattheirsummer quarters about the 

 Pueblo de los Angeles and Santa Barbara, in California, about the first week 

 in April, and the female in a week or so afterwards. They resort to the 

 retired hedges of vineyards and orchards, and occasionally are seen among 

 the trees in the town. Its song during this joyful season is uttered in a 

 loud clear tone, and sometimes varied, but generally wek te te.k tshe-o tshe-o 

 tshe-o, wek le Uk (she-o. This is continued at intervals while flitting through 

 the budding trees in search of their insect fare. When it observes any ob- 

 ject of suspicion, it utters a few guttural croaking scolding notes, and con- 

 ceals itself among the leafy boughs. 



About the middle of April I saw them commencing to hang their nests in 

 the manner of our golden Robin, on the pendulous branches ef the willow and 

 other trees surrounding the vineyards, and as far as I remained to see them 

 completed, they were made with the same ingenious interweaving of delicate 

 materials to form a pouch. 



Afjeliaus xmitkrocrphalns, Bonap. Yellow-headed Blackbird. 



Abundant in California. 

 , A. phafiieeus, (Linn.) Vieill. Red winged Blackbird. 



Abundant in New Mexico and California. 



A. tricolor, Aud. Three colored Blackbird. 



This handsome species, discovered by Mr. Nuttall, and sent to Audubon 

 with the above name, is abundant in California, going in small flocks in 

 company with the other species. Its notes are very different from those of 

 the red-wing, with which it associates, being a kind of guttural squeaking, 

 like that made by a dying animal. The red of the wing cannot be seen 

 when they are closed, looking as if it only had a white band. 



A. ffuhernutor, (Wagler) Bonap. Two colored Blackbird. 



This pretty species is abundant, also, in California, and along the western 

 coast of Mexico. It is often found in company with the/^AcE/iicci/^, which it

so much resembles, together keeping about corrals and places where cattla 

 have been.

PROCEEDINGS 



OF THE 



ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES 



OFPHILADELPHIA.. 



Vol. III. MAY AND JUNE, 1847. No. 9. 



Stated Meeting, May 4, 1847. 



The Society convened this evening, for the first time, in the 

 nd^ and commodious Librarj and Meeting Room in the 

 basement of their Hall. On this occasion, Vice-President 

 MoRTOX, upon taking the Chair, addressed the Society as 

 follows : — 



Gentlemen, — As we now meet here for the first time, and 

 under circumstances highly auspicious to the success of our In- 

 stitution and to the interests of science, I beg to be indulged in a 

 few remarks. 



On the evening of the 25tb of January, 1812, six gentlemen 

 met at a private residence, the home of one of them, in this city. 

 Their objects were, conversation and improvement. They had 

 often met before, but without any definite intention ; but they 

 were noio incited by a new impulse, a prospective enterprise. — 

 Let them speak for themselves, in the following brief but emphatic 

 declaration : 



" We will contribute to the formation of a museum of natural 

 history, a library of works of science, a chemical experimental 

 laboratory, an experimental philosophical apparatus, and every 

 other desirable appendage or convenience for the illustration and 

 advancement of natural knowledge, and for the common benefit 

 of all those individuals who may be admitted members of our In- 

 stitution." 



This resolve wan adopted at the second meeting of the found- 

 ers, one week after their primary sitting, on which occasion 



29 




208 [May, 1847. 



Thomas Say was also present, and Dr. Ocrard Troost was elect- 

 ed first President of this Society. Little did these two gentle- 

 men, and their five colIeaf;ues, foresee the results of their unpre- 

 tending enterprise ; for Science, in this country, was then in its 

 infancy, and the number of those who fostered it was few indeed. 



From the acorn springs the oak ; and from the humble eflforts 

 and continued self-sacrifices of a few private individuals, has 

 arisen this Institution, now grown to the manhood of science. 



Thirty-five years have elapsed since those seven persons, pri- 

 Tate citizens, men without fortune or influence, laid the foundation 

 of our Society. That their intentions have been ably and zeal- 

 ously sustained, through periods of probation and uncertainty, I 

 can safely aver. Trials are the best incentives to exertion ; and 

 the mind knows not its resources until forced to contend with ad- 

 verse circumstances. There were those who resolved in their 

 minds, who vowed in their hearts, that this institution should suc- 

 ceed. Many of them are now in their graves; but their me- 

 mory is inseparably blended with the annals and the honours of 

 science. Maclure, Say, Godman, Collins, Conrad, Harlan and 

 Keating — each has left his name on the tablet of nature ; and 

 could the venerable Maclure now behold the institution which be 

 so ably sustained, and so munificently provided for, how would 

 he rejoice in the consummation of those hopes which he so ar- 

 dently cherished during the last twenty-five years of his life ! 



Among our living members are many to whom I would gladly 

 award the just meed of praise for their signal and successful exer- 

 tions in this our common cause ; and there is one among us in 

 the prime of life, and full of zeal in diffusing those great truths 

 which in part illustrate, in part constitute, the laws of Omnipo- 

 tence. He has come to us clothed in the spirit of science. 

 What he has accomplished, every eye can see. An hundred 

 years of ordinary prosperity could not have realized so much. 

 To say less would be unjust. To say more would wound a mind 

 that shrinks from observation and eulogy. 



Let us continue our exertions to make this Institution a practi- 

 cal school of Natural History, by throwing open our doors to all 

 who seek knowledge ; and, supported and encouraged by the flat- 

 tering auspices under which we have now met, let us redouble 

 our zeal to unfold and difi"use the truths of Science.

Professor Hare made some observations on the combustion 

 of gum in oxygen gas, and stated that tlie brilliant light which 

 it emitted during combustion, proceeded from the presence of 

 lime, which he considered an essential constituent of gums. 



Dr. Leidy stated that Avhilst engaged in examining the 

 structure of some Lichens, he discovered numerous octagonal 

 crystals intermingled with the cellular structure of several 

 species of Parmelia. Many of the crystals equalled in size 

 the greenish cells themselves, although none of them appeared 

 to be contained within the latter. As chemical analysis has 

 detected in these plants a large proportion of oxalate of 

 lime, Dr. Leidy supposed these crystals to be that salt.

Meeting for Business, May 25, 1847. 



Vice President Morton in the Chair. 



After some preliminary business had been concluded. Dr. 

 Morton made a few remarks on an aboriginal cranium ob- 

 tained by Dr. Davis and Mr. Squier, during their researches 

 in the mounds near Chilicothe, Ohio. Dr. M. observed that 

 it possessed in a remarkable manner all those characteristics 

 which pertain, in various degrees, to the Indian skull in every 

 region of this continent, viz.: — the vertical occiput, great 

 vertical diameter, and corresponding width between the parie- 




May, 1847.] 213 



tal bones, so that the several diameters are nearly equal, 

 giving the whole head a singularly high, and squared or conical 

 form, while the forehead recedes less and the face is less 

 prominent than is usual in skulls of the American race. Dr- 

 M. added, that he had in his possession upwards of four hun- 

 dred Indian crania, but that this was more beautifully de- 

 veloped, in all its proportions, than any one of them. The 

 relic in question possesses additional interest from the opi- 

 nion of the gentlemen who found it, that it pertains to the 

 race of aboriginal mound builders.

A letter was read from Prof. Andreas lletzius, dated 

 Stockholm, April 25, 1847, acknowledging the receipt of his 

 notice of election as a Correspondent of the Academy, and 

 communicating the result of Prof. MuUer's examination of the 

 Hydrarchos of Dr. Kock, which he is satisfied is identical with 

 the Basilosaurus of Harlan, (Zeuglodon cetoides, Owen ;) a 

 fact long since announced by this Society, and published in 

 its Proceedings. 



Prof, lletzius also stated that he had detected a cutaneous 

 gland in the Fox, (Canis vulpes) near the root of the tail, 

 opening on the surface, and emitting an agreeable odour. lie 

 considered this gland characteristic of the genus Vulpes, and 

 desires further investigation of the subject. 



Prof. Uare made some observations on the weather of the 

 past spring, referring particularly to the great prevalence of 

 easterly Avinds, and their unnsual and remarkable aridity, and 

 as a consequence, the retarding of vegetation. 



He also expressed his conviction that rain only occurred 

 when two strata of clouds existed ; if only one was present, 

 its moisture would be absorbed by the surrounding atmos- 

 phere. 



Mr. Gliddon remarked that the casts of Egyptian tablets, 

 presented this evening, were those of ordinary funereal tablets, 

 which were frequently found with the mummies, deposited 

 by the friends of the deceased. They probably belonged to 

 the 18th or 19th Dynasty.

A letter was read from J. W. Dawson, Esq., dated Pictou, 



N. S., May 25, 1847, acknowledging the receipt of his notice 

 of election as a Correspondent. 



Dr. Leidy exhibited a drawing of an Entozoon, (a species 

 of Distoma,) found in the pericardium of Helix alternata. 

 This entozoon is half a line in length by a quarter of a line in 

 breadth, a large comparative size, when its situation is con- 

 sidered, being equal to that of the ventricle of the heart. 

 The pericardium was perfectly transparent, and presented no 

 appearance o/ cicatrix, or marks of external communication. 

 Dr. Leidy then read the following description of 



Distoma Helicis. — Oval, flattened, white in colour; oral 

 disk large, round, marked by radiating lines : posterior disk 

 central, about the size of that of the mouth, radiate, with a 

 dark spot in the centre. Intestinal canal commencing by a 

 fusiform oesophagus, the apex of which joins a round stoma- 

 chal cavity, from which passes off on each side a convoluted 

 intestinum, which proceeds to the posterior extremity of the 

 body. About half way between the central disk and the

posterior extremity of the animal, I indistinctly observed 

 what I presumed to be the generative orifice. 



By permission of the Society, a report was received from 

 the Committee on Dr. R. W. Gibbes' memoir, entitled " On 

 the fossil genus Zeuglodon, Owen, with an account of speci- 

 mens from the Eocene green sand of South Corolina," recom- 

 mending the same for publication in the forthcoming number 

 of the Journal of the Academy. The report was adopted. 



Meeting for Business, June 29, 1847. 



Mr. Phillips in the Chair. 



The Committee, to whom was referred Prof. Hare's paper 

 entitled " Objections to the electrical theories of Franklin, 

 Du Faye, and Ampere, with some suggestions as a substitute," 

 reported in favour of publication in the Journal of the 

 Academy. The report was adopted. 



The Committee on Mr. Peter A. Browne's paper, proposing 

 a new nomenclature for the class Mammalia, reported that 

 the views taken by the author, although novel and ingenious, 

 did not, in their opinion, justify the substitution of the names 

 proposed for those in use, and established by Cuvier and 

 others. The Committee also requested that a copy of the 

 paper might be deposited in the Library of the Academy. 

 The report was adopted. 



The Committee on a paper by Lieut. J. W. Abert, U. S. A., 

 describing a supposed new species of Quail inhabiting 

 New Mexico, reported the same to be the Ortyx squamata, 

 Vigors ; and recommended for publication the following por- 

 tion of the communication. 



" This bird appears to be well known throughout the whole de- 

 partment of New Mexico, for a sketch that I had inside of it was 

 universally recognized by the inhabitants of that couutry, who 

 called it " La Codurniz." I met with several coveys on the 

 banks of the " Rio del Norte," opposite to Socorro," but I had 

 not the good fortune to obtain any specimena until Nov. l'2ifi, 




222 [June, 1847. 



when in the ntigbbourhood of ' Busqaecito,' and again on the 

 9th of Dec, wlieu hunting, about eight noiles to the north of 

 ' Fray Cristobal.' 



These birds congregate in flocks or coveys of from 20 to 30 ; 

 when alarmed, they omit a chicking note, and run with such ra- 

 pidity, that it is difficult to get a second sight of a covey, that one 

 may have startled ; they seem to love the low sandy bottoms 

 where the wild sage grows ; as these bottoms are covered with 

 little knolls, which with the sage, serves to secure them from 

 their enemies. Although not hunted by the people, they are 

 shy. When forced to take wing, they make a whizzing sound 

 that startles one, scattering as they fly, so that when they alight, 

 they are at considerable intervals from each other, but they soon call 

 together, with the uttering of a single whistling note. I dissected 

 several, and found them to contain small green insects of the 

 Hemipterous order, also grass seed and the berries of the mistle- 

 toe, which in that country grows on nearly every cotton-wood 

 tree. The female bears so great a resemblance to the male, that 

 dissection alone can serve to determine the sex." 



The Publication Committee, to whom was referred Prof. 

 C. B. Adams' letter of May 22d, relative to a paper on the 

 Natural History of Jamaica, reported that they deem it at 

 present inexpedient to accept the proposal of Prof. Adams, in 

 regard to publishing the same in the first number of the new 

 series of the Journal of the Academy. The report was 

 adopted. 



The report of the Corresponding Secretary was read and 

 adopted. 



The following resolution was adopted. 



Resolved, That subscribers to the Journal of the Academy 

 be entitled to the Proceedings of the same, free of charge 

 during the period of their subscription. 



ELECTION.

July, 1847.] 229 



From Henry Sejbert, Esq., dated Philadelphia, July 5, 

 1847, in reference to the deposit of his chemical apparatus 

 and books in the Institution, the conditions of the deposit 

 being, that the whole is to become the property of the Society, 

 unless withdrawn by himself during his life-time, under the 

 usual rules regulating such deposits. 



From Richard Brown, Esq, dated Sydney Mines, Cape 

 Breton, Nova Scotia, addressed to the Corresponding Secre- 

 tary, of which the following is an extract : 



■' During the last winter months I frequently went into the Pits, 

 and rejoice to say was rewarded by the discovery of some remark- 

 able fossils in the roof of the seam. One was an upright Lepidoden- 

 dron 12 inches diameter, with roots spreading out in all directions 

 to a distance of 7 to 8 feet from the stem. The roots near their 

 junction with the stem, present rhomboidal markings combined 

 with areolae of stigmaria — nearer to the extremities of the roots, 

 the rhomboidal spaces disappear and the surface assumes the ap- 

 pearance of true ivtigniariffi. A pith or core of iron pyrites is found 

 in some of the roots. I sent drawings and descriptions of this fos- 

 sil to Mr. Bunbury about a month ago. You will probably see 

 them in the London Geological Journal, for August next. 



I have also got another remarkable fossil, a complete root-stock 

 of a dome-shaped figure, but the stem had been broken short off, 

 and the bark squeezed together by the mud deposited upon it. It is 

 covered with a coaly bark 10th of an inch thick ; presents leaf scars 

 arranged in double lines similar to the Sigillaria alternans of Lind- 

 iey and Hutton. Roots spread out in all directions, marked with 

 areolae of stigmaria; but what is most curious, the under side of the 

 root exhibits a series of short, obtuse tap roots, arranged nearly in 

 a circle— these are marked with scars similar to stigmarije. The 

 under side of the root is also covered with a thin coaly bark — the 

 verfical tap roots are 3 inches long, 2 in diameter at their junction 

 with the root-stocks, and terminate downwards in an obtuse point, 

 the shape being fusiform, or not unlike a short carrot. 



In addition to these, I have got some fine specimens of fossil 

 fruits from the same locality. They appear to have been similar to 

 those of Pandanus ; the seeds being arranged on the surface and 

 continuing in towards the centre. Before compression they proba- 

 bly resembled a fluted melon in shape, and were as large." 



Prof. Hare presented a Synopsis of his paper on Electricity 

 (read at a late meeting of the Academy,) which being designed 




280 [July, 1847. 



for publication in the Journal, as the commencement of said 

 paper, was referred to the same committee. 



On motion of Prof. Johnson, Resolved, that the thanks of 

 the Academy be presented to Mr. H. Seybert for his liberality 

 in depositing for the use of this Institution, to an indefinite 

 period, his extensive and valuable chemical apparatus an'l 

 collection of works on chemistry.

By Georgk a. M'Call. 

 Columba *solitaria. 



Length 13 inches 9 lines. Alar extent 23 inches. Wing, from 

 the flexure, 7 inches, 5 lines. Tarsus 1 inch; middle toe 1 

 inch, 2 lines ; first toe 9 lines, and longer than the third ; nails 

 light flesh colour; feet and legs deep red. Iris dark-orange. Bill 

 above, 1 inch, 1 line, but feathered to within 5 lines of the tip; 

 reddish near the base, whitish near the tip. Head chocolate-blue. 

 Throat chocolate-white. Neck and breast bluish-chocolate with 

 brilliant reflections. Back, belly, flanks, underwing-coverts and 

 greater exterior wing-coverts light red colour, the last faintly 

 bordered with white. Lesser wing-coverts chocolate red, forming

 tinged with lead colour on the outer vanes, ord primary longest. 

 Upper and under tail coverts bluish-lead colour. Tail 5 inche.s ; 

 slightly rounded ; of twelve feathers ; dusky. 



Individuals of this fine species, which, in general contour, re- 

 sembles Columba (Enas, were found on the Rio Grande, from 

 Matamoras to Camargo — these were shy, and only met with at 

 intervals. They were again observed on one or two of the smaller 

 water courses between the former place and Victoria, but never 

 in flocks ; nor were more than half-a-dozen seen anywhere in

 near the water, or with rapid win£f .shaping his solitary course 

 across the extensive waste. His lii{i;ht is extremely bold, as he 

 pitches in wide irregular ziij-zaya through the air, with a velocity 

 scarcely to be surpassed. The meat for delicacy of flavour is not 

 •excelled by any of the family. 



(rEOCOCCYX viATicus, Wagler. 



(^For a description of this bird, see Proceedings of the Academy, 

 vol. 2, No. 10.) 



The G. viaficus, which the Mexicans familiarly call Paisano, 

 (countryman,) is found in Texas, from the lliver Nueces to the 

 Rio Grande, and in ]\[oxico, from the seaboard at least to the 

 Sierre Madre ; and being an inhabitant of the chaparral, or thorny 

 thicket, he rarely ventures far beyond its borders. Although the 

 toes of this bird are disposed in opposite pairs as in other species 

 df his family, yet the outer hind too being revcrseable and of great 

 flexibility, is in either position aptly applied in climbing or perch- 

 ing, as well as on the ground. Thus he at times pitches along 

 the ground in irregular but vigorous hops, and again when the 

 outer toe is thrown forward, he runs smoothly, and with such 

 velocity as always to be able to elude a dog in the chaparral, with- 

 out taking wing. He feeds on coleoptei-a, and almost every 

 species of insects. And near the Nueces where the snail {Lym- 

 naeics !f'a</nalii) abounds, it is also greedily eaten. These he 

 snatches from the ground or plucks from the low branch of a 

 bush, and as he rarely wanders far from his abode, the prize is 

 carried to a particular spot, where the shell is broken with his 

 strong bill and the animal devoured. Piles of these shells are 

 often found that would half fill a hat crown. 



Although dwelling principally on the ground, he is ready and 

 expert in catching his prey in the air. in which act his movements 

 are full of animation — boundinj from the ground with a sudden 

 impulse to the height of 8 or 10 feet, his wings and tail are seen 

 'Expanded for a scarcely appreciable instant, and his bill is heard 

 to snap as he takes his prey, when he drops as suddenly to the 

 spot from which he sprang. Here he will stand for a moment, 

 his legs apart, and his tail flirted on one side with a wild and ec- 

 centric expression of exultation in his attitude, before he scampers 

 under cover of the thick chaparral. At first I thought — as is the 

 general impression among the Mexicans — that his potvers of flight 

 were extremely limited; but he will, when suddenly alarmed in 




Aug, 1847.] 235 



open ground, rise with a liglit, quick motion, and contioue his 

 flight over the bushes for some hundred yards apparently with 

 an ease that would argue the ability to sustain a longer flight. 



Though fond of shade and solitude, he will at an early hour in 

 th e morning, climb to the top of a straight leafless branch, there 

 to sit and enjoy the first rays of the sun. 



He is said by the Mexican rancheros to build his nest of loose 

 sticks either in a low thick bush, or in close cover on the ground. 

 The eggs are about three in number, of a whitish colour. 



The Monthly Report of the Corresponding Secretary yf<is

Dr. Morton read some additions to Dr. Gibbes' paper, sug -

of London, dated Jan. 19, 1847, acknowledging the receipt 

 )f" certain Nos. of the Journal, recently transmitted at the re- 

 < I nest of that Society. 



From the Lihrarian of the Boston Society of Natural His- 

 tory, transmitting certain portions of the Proceedings of that 

 Society, at the request of the Corresponding Secretary of the 

 Academy. 



From Miss Morris, of Germantown, dated July 20, 1847, 

 addressed to the Corresponding Secretary, communicating 

 the following in relation to the Hessian fly, and to the insect 

 destructive to the Raspberry plant : 



" I have great pleasure ia banding to you a box containing the 

 larvae of the Cecidomjia, described bv me in 1841, and a vial 

 with those described by Dr. Fitch. 



The difference is so marked that I (hink no doubt can arise io 

 the mind of any one that there are two species. 



The species in the vial were procured from New Jersey by 

 Mr. Haines, and presented to me ; from the same source 1 ex- 

 pect pu]iM-> from which I hope to obtain the flies in September. 



What Las retarded the earlier development of the Larvae in the 

 centre of the straw it is impossible to conjecture, but I fear now 

 they will all perish, as they have not attained more than half their 

 growth, and the straw is all dead and ready for the harvest. 



The three stems of ra.^pberry which will accompany this, con- 

 tain the nests of a Hymenopterous insect which has troubled us 

 for some years, but whose history we were unacquainted with 

 until this morninjz;, when I discovered them, as as you will see, in 

 the centre of the stem. In one you will find eggs, in another 

 pupae, and a third contains both pupae and the perfect insect. 



T am not prepared to say whether it be the parent or larva that 

 causes the greatest injury, as I have not seen the worm feeding 

 on the pith, but am well assured that they are too injurious to 

 suffer them to remain uimoticed. This spring, in many of the 

 gardens in this neighbourhood, entire rows of raspberries were 

 blighted by them; it is said the worm fed on the pith, but I am 

 in doubt, as I found a worm, which 1 am inclined to think was 

 ]..epidopterou5, in thtir nest, but may have been a starved speci- 

 men of their own brood. 



Since writing the above, I find that the worm feeds on the pith 

 of the raspberry, and that its history is briefly this: the fly de- 

 posit.s its eggs in the new shoot or summer growth in the fall, and 

 the worm feeds on the pith until the following July, when it un- 

 dergoes its transformation."

 objects of Natural History of this country could be procured 

 for the same. Referred to the Zoological Committee. 



The following communication was read from Mr. Wm. S. 

 Pease, of N. Y., containing some remarks '-a the localities 

 whence the fossils presented by him this evening were ob- 

 tained : 



" The basin of the Chesapeake and its tributaries, the Patapsco, 

 Gunpowder, and other rivers, drain a vast number of shallow 

 vallies, which have been rendered such bj filling up with clay, 

 mostly blue, sometimes variegated, containing stone, iron ore in 

 nodular masses with lignite and sulphuret of Iron. Near Balti- 

 more the ere is very abundant, whilst the pyrites and lignite are 

 predominant lower down. The whole rests upon hornblende rocks. 

 This clay is often intercalated with ferruginous sands and gravel. 

 These gravels often unite and form a hard conglomerate rock, 

 as the " White rocks" in the mouth of Patapsco river. The 

 whole deposit is irregular in thickness, enlarging at some points 

 and thinning off very much in others; varying much also in 

 color and consistency. It is always, however, highly ferruginous in 

 its composition, with one exception, and that in the case of a 

 deep leaden or black colored clay, which, upon calcination, be- 

 comes white. Hayden, in his Geological Essays, speaks of lignite 

 having been found in this strata with shark's teeth, &c., (doubtful.) 

 The fossils accompanying this were found in a thin vein passing 

 through the above clay formation, which enlarges very much near 

 the city of Baltimore, and forms the hill known as Telegraph or 

 Federal Hill, associated with lignite and sulphuret of Iron. Cu- 

 cullias have been found at Bear creek, (emptying into the Patap- 

 sco) .5 or 6 miles from Baltimore, partly composed of earthy 

 blue Phosphate of Iron. They were thrown out of an excavation 

 for a well about 25 feet deep. With these, other fossil traces 




Aug., 1847.] 243 



were recognized, but they were not suflSciently distinct to be re- 

 ferred to any class. 



Thuse vegetable impressions I would refer to tbe Henopteris 

 or Glossopteris, and are new. 



In the Geological Report of the State, this formation is placed 

 below the Tertiary." 



The Chairman read a letter from Dr. JeiFries Wjman, dated 

 Boston, Aug. 5, 1847, enclosing sketches of crania of a male 

 and female supposed new species of Oj-ang, inhabiting 

 Western Africa, brought to this country by Dr. Thomas S. 

 Savage. Information on the subject was requested from the 

 Society. 



Dr. Morton read a portion of a memoir designed for pub- 

 lication in the Journal, " On the position of the Ear in the 

 statuary and paintings of the civilized nations of antiquity;" 

 which was referred to a Committee consisting of Mr. Gliddon, 

 Dr. Pickering and Dr. Wilson. 



Dr. Leidy presented an instance of a curious optical illusioa 

 arising from a peculiarity in the structure of the intervertebral 

 substance of man. He stated the external third of each disk to be 

 composed of concentric layers of non elastic or white fibrous tis- 

 sue, the fibres of which are oblique, those of the alternate layers 

 cro.ssing each other. This arrangement, when viewed from either 

 side, gives rise to the appearance of alternating layers of white 

 fibrous tissue, indicated by its shining whiteness and opacity, and 

 of cartilage, indicated by its semi-transparency and dulness, and 

 this is actually stated to be the arrangement in anatomical works 

 generally, and even in the late and very excellent Physiological 

 Anatomy of Messrs. Todd and Bowman. 



The illusion is well marked : if a disk be held side-ways in the 

 hand, and pins be stuck in what seem to be the alternating layers 

 of cartilage, and then viewed from the other Ride, the pins wiJl 

 actually appear to have changed their position from the cartilage 

 to the fibrous layers. 



Dr. L. explained the illusion by supposing it to be produced 

 in the one case from the rays-of light reflected from the numerous 

 points of the fibres, when the eye is opposed to them, giving rise 

 to a divided, and consequently white, opaque surface, while in the 

 other direction, the rays of light being partly transmitted by the 

 extremities of the fibres, give rise to the characteristic dulness and 

 semitransparency of cartilage. 




244 [Aug., 1847. 



By permission of the Society, a report was received from 

 the Committee on Prof. Ilaldeman's paper, containing de-

 teeth, counting froia before backwards, and five teeth in each 

 row, in the lower jaw ; and nine rows with the same number 

 in each row, in the upper jaw. The intestinal canal is very 

 simple, and has but one convolution in its course. The oesopha- 

 gus is capacious and undefined from the stomach : both arc 

 strongly muscular.

Description and Anafomy of anew and curious sub-genus of Flanaria. 

 By Joseph Leidy, M. D. 



la October, 1840, Prof. S. S. Haldeman published a description of 

 an animal under the name of Planaria gracilis.* Upon examination 

 I detected such a remarkable peculiarity in the digestive apparatus 

 as led me to investigate its anatomy in detail, and to form for it a 

 separate sub-genus, characterised as follows : 



Pkagoca'a, oblonga, plano-convexa, nuda, contractilis, mucosa, 

 antica auricularia. Aperturse dua;, ventrales, ad os at generationem 

 pertinens. Proboscides multiE. 



P. gracilis, nigricans, lateribus parallelis, postero acuto abruptc, 

 plerumque antico recto ; oculis duobus. Long. 91in., lat. llin. Hab- 

 itat in fontibus Pennsylvaniae. 



Description. Oblong, limaceform, naked, convex superiorly, flat 

 inferiorly, very contractile ; sides ordinarily parallel, convex when the 

 animal is in a contracted state, convergent anteriorly when elongated ; 

 anterior extremity with a lateral triangular auricular appendage, 

 straight in front, by contraction becoming convex or concave ; poste- 

 rior extremity abruptly pointed ; ocelli two, anterior composed of an 

 oblong, semi-transparent (nervous?) mass with an intensely black dot 

 of pigmentum at the internal posterior part ; ventral apertures two; 

 oral aperture a little less than one-third the length of the body from

 way between the oral aperture and posterior extremity. Colour black 

 or iron gray, and some younger specimens latericeous. 



This animal I have only found in abundance in the neighborhood of 

 Prof. Haldeman's residence, near Columbia, Pa. In a spring in front 

 of his house, thousands of them may be seen gliding along the bottom; 

 some of them occasionally creep up the sides to the surface of the

 water Univalve Shells of North America," containing descriptions of ap-

water, turn apon the back, and by making the ventral surface con- 

 cave, float about in the manner of the Limmadce. It appears to be 

 carnivorous in habit, or at least it attaches itself to animal matter, 

 dead or living, in preference to vegetable matter. When irritated, 

 it throws out a considerable quantity of very tenacious mucus. 



In structure it appears to be intermediate between the entozoic 

 Distomata and the aunulose Hirudinoe. I could not detect any trace 

 of annulation, but I think that this alone would hardly be sufBcient 

 to place it lower than the latter animals, because, in a closely allied 

 animal, the Gordius aquaticus, although there is no annulation in the 

 perfect animal, yet in the embryo state I find it to exist. 



The whole animal is composed of a delicate granular structure : the 

 only approach to muscular fibre is in the longitudinal striation of the 

 integument rendered more distinct by the pigmentum nigrum, a ra- 

 diated appearance around the oral orifice, and a faint transverse and 

 longitudinal arrangement of the granules entering into the composi- 

 tion of the proboscides, seen more or less distinctly in the continued 

 movements of these organs when slightly compressed beneath the 

 microscope. 



The digestive cavity presents the same dendritic arrangements as 

 \\x Planarioe generally,* but instead of posessing a single sucker or 

 proboscis, the full grown animal has not less than twenty-three ; vary- 

 ing, however, in this respect from three upwai'ds, according to the age 

 of the animal. One of these proboscides joins the digestive cavity 

 at the posterior part of the anterior division, as usual, the others join 

 the remaining two divisions at their internal side in their course back- 

 wards. They are considerably longer, but narrower than in P. lactea,f 

 and when not in use are closely packed together within the animal, 

 so that when the latter is placed beneath the microscope and slightly 

 compressed, they will be seen pressing upon one another in such a 

 manner, that if one changes its position, it will be instantly occupied 

 by another. Those which are formed last are smallest, but they soon 

 gain their full size. 



When the animal feeds, the whole of them are protruded from the 

 oral orifice, the longest extending out full one-third the length of the 

 body. As they are all convergent to the same orifice, when fully pro - 

 truded the animal becomes puckered up and increased in breadth at 

 the expense of the length. In this state the anterior extremity is erected 

 and the posterior brought nearly to a right angle with it, so that it 

 looks as if sitting upon its prey apparently unconcerned, with its pro-

boscides, whicli writhe and twist about as if they were totall> distinct 

 org.inisms. 



If one of these animals be punctured or cut. one or more of the 

 proboscides will be immediately protruded as if they existed under 

 pressure, and will move about in all directions appearinff as if (iutirely 

 without the control of the animal ; or if one of the animals be crushed 

 between two slips of f,Mass so that the proboscides will be torn from 

 their attachment, they move about involuntarily, always in a line for- 

 wards or towards the mouth, which they do by contractinjf the stom- 

 achal extremity towards the oral, the latter remaining fixed. In this 

 progressive course they constantly contract and dilate; the n'outh 

 opens and any matter in its vicinity rushes in, when it is closed and 

 the matter passes onwards, and by the alternate contraction and dila- 

 tation of different parts of the same tube, it is thrown backwards and 

 forwards several times, and finally violently expelled at the tornex - 

 tremity. When they have escaped from the ruptures of the tegument 

 produced by crushing, or when snipped off with a pair of scissors 

 whilst an animal is feeding, they will present the same curious pheno- 

 mena. In fact these carious independent movements caused me at 

 first to mistake the organs for viviparous young, and it was not until 

 I had frequently observed the animal feeding, and examined its struc- 

 ture beneath the microscope, after having fed them upon coloured 

 food, that I was convinced of their true nature. 



Excrementitious matter is expelled from the digestive cavity 

 through the same course by which the food enters. 



Circulation. There appears to be nothing peculiar about the 

 arrangement of the blood vessels, if such they be ; the term being ap- 

 plied to two semitransparent lines passingalong each side of the ven- 

 tral surface, and a third along the middle of the dorsal surface, the 

 three freely communicating with each other by transverse lines and 

 numerous smaller branches, the whole forming an extensive reticula- 

 tion upon the surface of the body. At the anterior part of each 

 ventral line, I distinctly observed a dilatation to exist. 



Generative apparatris. As in all Planarice the animal is androgy- 

 nous. The penis is a bulbiform organ placed between the oral and 

 generative orifice with its point directed towards the latter. The 

 point is straight, or contorted ; the bulbous portion is also changeable, 

 sometimes elongated, at others flattened or increased in l>readth at 

 the expense of the length. The bulb shows through the thin integu- 

 ment, and without close examination may be taken for a third orifice. 

 The penis is perforate, and has a dilated cavity within the bulb. Im- 

 mediately above the penis I indistinctly observed a somewhat lobated 

 organ, which appeared to join the penis at its base by a narrow per- 




Aug., 1847.] , 251 



lion. This is probably the testicle, for it was tlie only thing I could 

 discover in connection with the genitalia to correspond to it. 



In two individuals only could I see part of the female organs. This 

 consisted in two sigmoid tubes or oviducts, which could be traced 

 from the generative orifice a short distance forwards, one on each side 

 of the penis, 



I could detect no traces of a nervous system. 



The eyes, so called, have been previously described. It is still a 

 question with many, whether these, as well as the corresponding deep 

 black points existing in very many of the lower animals of the inver- 

 tebrate series, subserve the purpose of eyes; and some anatomists 

 have even gone so far as to deny the sense of sight to the compara- 

 tively perfect eye of many gasteropodous mollusca. The experiments 

 which are made to test the existence of this sense in those organs for 

 the most part are exceedingly fallacious, generally being performed 

 by concentrating the light upon them through a lens. Insects, and 

 even serpents and frogs, I find will frequently bear the impression of 

 a sudden glare of light produced in this way without any inconveni- 

 ence, at other times they will seek to avoid it, but Helix albolahris 

 will occasionally retract its tenticle when so distufted, and Phagocata 

 will frequently raise its anterior extremity and move from the too 

 great light. From their position, which is always such as to be well 

 exposed to the influence of the light, from their structure, imperfect 

 as it is in many cases, and their connection with the nervous system 

 when this exists, I am led to conclude that in all cases they are or- 

 gans of vision. 



The general sensibility of Phagocata is very consideiable, that is 

 it contracts with great readiness from the slightest disturbance. The 

 contraction has much the appearance of being involuntary and is very 

 like that of the Mediisoe. When an individual is irritated at any point, 

 contraction commences and thence rapidly extends throughout the 

 animal, and the only appearance of volition is in the effort to escape^ 

 but if the touch be too rude, apparently involuntary contraction takes 

 place suddenly and appears to destroy all power of volition for the 

 moment ; the animal however soon revives from this state and glides 

 off with its accustomed speed. 



Some experiments which I performed upon Phagocata confirm the 

 statements that the Planarice are capable of repairing injuries. 

 When an individual is cut into two, both parts after a time become 

 distinct and perfect animals. Division carried to a greater extent in 

 some instances results in as many perfect animals as there are parts, 

 but generally I have found that when cut into more than three or four

pieces, the intermediate pieces are apt to die, and sometimes tlio 

 extremities do not survive.

Description of two new species of Plonaria. 

 By JosKi'H Lkidy, M. D. 



Planaria maculata. Superiorly convex, faintly blackish or brown- 

 ish with irregular colorless maculae ; inferiorly flat, colorless ; anteriorly 

 trapezoidal; posteriorly spatulate or oval; eyes two, anterior, proxi- 

 mate, composed of a large semi-transparent mass with a reniform mass 

 of pigmentum nigrum at the postero-intornal part ; oral aperture 

 ventral, one-third the length of the body from the posterior extrem- 

 ity; proboscis large and cylindrical. Length 2^ lines; breadth ^ line. 

 Found in moderate abundance, in the ditches below the city, creeping 

 upon the submerged stems of aquatic plants. 



Subgenus. Prostoma, Duges. Mouth anterior and terminal. 



Prostoma marginatum. Blackish, narrow lanceolate, anteriorly 

 truncate ; marginate, margin delicately striate ; mouth large ; pro- 

 boscis large and oblong; eyes two, anterior, distant, each consisting 

 of two round masses of pigmentum nigrum in contact with each other, 

 and of which one is larger than the other ; generative orifice one- 

 fourth the length of the body from the posterior extremity. Length 

 1 line. A single specimen found with the preceding ; but probably not 

 rare, for from its small size, it escaped my notice while collecting son-.c 

 of the former, and it was not until I got home that I detected its 

 existence in the vessel of water containing the others. 



The anatomy of P. maculata does not differ from that of Planaria 

 lactea as given by Duges in the Annales des Sciences Naturelles. In 

 Prostoma marginatum the digestive 'cavity has not the dendritic ar- 

 rangement of Planaria, but merely consists of a large capacious sac 

 extending as far back as the posterior third of the body, and having a 

 coecum upon each side of the proboscis. The penis has a yellow color 

 and consists of a round granular mass, with a moderately long and 

 bent spiculum projecting from its posterior part. The arrangement 

 of a female apparatus I failed to trace. 



Amendments to Articles 7 and 8, of Chap. vii. of the By- 

 laws, proposed by Dr. Bridges, were adopted. 

 These Articles now read as follows : 




Aug. 1847.] 268 



*' Art. vii. — Members may borrow books, the property of 

 the Academy, from the Librarian, on signing a promissory 

 note for fifty dollars, which shall become void on the book 

 being returned." 



" Art. viii. — But no works shall be loaned from the Hall, 

 on any account whatever, except those marked with an aste- 

 risk (thus *) in the Catalogue, unless by an affirmative ballot 

 vote of three-fourths of the members present when the applica- 

 tion is made ; and in case of deposited books the written 

 consent of the depositor having been previously obtained : 

 the name of the borrower and the title of the book to be re- 

 corded on the minutes, and security given for its safe return 

 by note or otherwise for the full value thereof, according to 

 the estimate of the Librarian or Library Committee." 



On motion of Dr. Leidy, a committee was appointed to 

 examine into the expediency of converting the present lecture 

 room into a portion of the Museum, and also to ascertain what 

 alterations may be necessary for this purpose, &c., and to 

 report thereon as soon as practicable. Committee, Drs. 

 Bridges, Wilson and Morton.

On the Fo3sil Horse of America. 



By Joseph L.eidt, M. D. 



The fact of the existence of fossil remains of the horse in America has been 

 generally received with a good deal of incredulity, arising, perhaps, from the 

 mere fact being stated of their having been found, often without even mention- 

 ing the associate fossils, and in all cases, previous to Mr. Owen,* without des- 

 cribing the specimen. At present their existence being fully confirmed, 

 it is probably as much a wonder to naturalists as was the first sight ot

the horses of the Spaniards to the aboriginal inhabitants of the country, for it 

 is very remarkable that the genus Equus should have so entirely passed away 

 from the vast pastures of the vrestern world, in after ages to be replaced by 

 a foreign species to which the country has proved so well adapted ; and it is 

 impossible, in the present state of our knowledge, to conceive what could 

 have been the circumstances which have been so universally destructive to the 

 genus upon one continent, and so partial in its influence upon the other. 



The remains are by no means unfrequent, and according to William Cooper, 

 the author of a paper entitled " Notices of Big-Bone Lick," in Featherstonhaugh's 

 "Journal of Geology,"* the first printed notice of them occurs in Mitchell's 

 "Catalogue of Organic Remains,"! upon referring to which, I find mentioned 

 pp. 7, 8, that a cervical vertebra and teeth of the horse were found associated 

 with the Mastodon, &c., in a tract extending from the base of the Neversink 

 Hills to Bordentown, New Jersey. The author of "Notices, &c." also men- 

 tions the remains of the horse being found at Big-Bone Lick, but speaks doubt- 

 fully as to the authenticity of such remains having been found in a fossil state 

 in this country, and says, p. 208, " I saw nothing in support of it myself, nor 

 have I met with any person who could answer for such a fact from his own 

 careful observation." 



Dr. HarlanJ mentions the sparing existence of fossil remains of the horse, 

 which, from the heading of his chapter, he has referred to the same species as 

 the existing Equus caballus. 



The most satifactory account, however, with which I am acquainted, is given 

 by Mr. Owen in the Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle, Part 1, Fossil Mam- 

 malia, p. 109, and is derived from two teeth obtained by Mr. Darwin in South 

 America. One of them, a superior molar, was far decomposed, and Mr. Owen 

 observes, " every point of comparison that could be established, proved it to 

 difl"er from the tooth of the common Equus caballus only in a slight inferiority 

 of size." The other a superior left molar, was found with the Mastodon, &c., 

 in the province of Entre Rios, and is figured (PI. xxxii. figs. 13 and 14,) in the 

 work. One of the figures represents an antero-lateral view of the tooth, and is 

 rather smaller in size, and is much more curved than in the corresponding 

 tooth of the recent E. caballus. The other figure represents the crown of the 

 tooth and indicates the diameters to be somewhat less. From what Mr. Owen 

 remarks in the " British Fossil Mammalia,"^ this is a species which he proved 

 to be distinct from all European fossil and existing species, and from the 

 greater degree of curvature of the upper molars|| he has designated it under 

 the name of Equus curvidens. In the cabinet of the Academy there are a num- 

 ber of specimens of American fossil horse teeth, which I refer to two distinct 

 and well marked species. 



The first of these I consider as identical with the Equus curvidens, of which

there are ten specimens of permanent molars, one a superior posterior molar of 

 the left side, and five inferior molars of the right side, and four of the left side. 

 These were all obtained from that celebrated fossil bone deposit, Big-Bone 

 Lick, Kcntuck}-, where they were associated with the Mi'yalon;/z, Mastodon, &c., 

 and are a part of a donation to the Academy by Mr. J. P. Wetherill. The ex- 

 ternal cementum is almost entirely removed, and the color, which is brown in 

 the inferior molars, a bluish blatk in the superior molars, corresponds with 

 that of their fossil associates. They are very little inferior in size, both in 

 length and diameter, to the corresponding teeth of the recent E. caballus. The 

 lateral diameter of the inferior molars hardly varies at all, the difference exist- 

 ing in the transverse diameter, which gives to the teeth a rather more com- 

 pressed appearance. The superior posterior molar tooth in all sjfecies of Equus 

 is much curved, so that but little difference is observable in this respect in the 

 fossil specimen. The bodies of the inferior molars are considerably more curved 

 laterally than is usual in the corresponding teeth of the recent horse, which 

 fact, however, was not to be expected from the greater degree of curvature in 

 the superior molars. 



The enamel folds generally are more delicate, but I do not find sufficient pe- 

 culiarity in their course to render them characteristic. On comparing the 

 crowns of these fossil molar teeth, with, the recent species, I find a remarkable 

 degree of resemblance to exist, and in fact, greater differences may be found in 

 this respect, in different individuals of the existing species. The posterior part 

 of the enamel folding of the posterior tooth is rather narrower, and has a deeper 

 groove upon the outer side than I have seen in the recent tooth. The supe- 

 rior molars lead to more positive results than the inferior, yet it is necessary to 

 be very careful, for if we do perceive more differences in these particular teeth 

 in different species, than exists in the inferior teeth, so also do we find a 

 greater variation among them in different individuals of the same species. This 

 variation in the same species is very striking in the case of the posterior tooth 

 of the recent horse, as may be seen by comparing any number of specimens. 

 In this particular tooth in the recent horse, there is always a disposition to the 

 formation of a third isolated enamel fold, always small and posterior to the 

 others. Sometimes it appears as if the disposition existed, but for want of 

 room in the process of development of the tooth, the ordinary posterior, isola- 

 ted enamel fold becomes united by an isthmus to the peripheral fold. In the 

 fossil tooth no disposition of the kind has existed, so that it has more the ap- 

 pearance of the other molars, and indicates a less amount of room for develop- 

 ment, and consequently a smaller jaw. 



From the foregoing description it will be perceived that I have fixed upon no 

 absolute characters for determining this species with any degree of accuracy, 

 and that this is not possible, I may state upon the authority of Guvier, who ac- 

 knowledged his incompetency to find characters, " assez fixes," to pronounce 

 upon any species of horse, examined by him, from an isolated bone,* and it is 

 therefore only from their being fossil American teeth coinciding with the E.

curvidens as described bj Mr. Owen, more than with any other species, so far 

 as I am capable of judging, which has made me refer them to that species. 



The second species is founded upon twelve specimens of teeth which have 

 been deposited in the cabinet of the Academy by our enterprising fellow-mem- 

 ber, Dr. M. W. Dickeson, and is one only of the many important results of his 

 palaeontological researches in the southwestern part of the United States. 

 Ten of these interesting relics, consisting of five superior and five inferior mo- 

 lars, Dr. Dickeson states,* were obtained, together with remains of . the 

 Megalonyx, Ursus, the os hominis innominaium fossile, &c., in the vicinity of 

 Natchez, Mississippi, from a stratum of tenacious blue clay underlying a diluvial 

 deposit. The remaining two, both right superior posterior molars, are rolled 

 or water-worn, and were found, as Dr. D. informs me, upon one of the Natchez 

 Islands, in the Mississippi River. All the specimens have the exterior 

 cementum entirely removed, with the exception of one inferior molar of the 

 right side, in which it still exists upon the external face, and much of the in- 

 ferior cementum, and part even of the dentine, is also destroyed, so that the 

 enamel folds everywhere stand out in strong relief. 



These teeth are larger than those of any species heretofore known, recent 

 or fossil, and must have belonged to a horse, which, in point of magnitude, 

 was a fit cotemporary for the 3Iastodon, Elephas, ^c, and worthy of the large 

 continent which produced it, and I have therefore named it Equus Ameri- 

 canus. 



Two of the inferior molar teeth measure 4.3 inches in length, with a lateral 

 diameter of 1.25 of an inch, and a transverse diameter of .7 of an inch. Two 

 also, of the superior molars, measure 3.9 inches in length externally with a 

 lateral diameter of 1.2 of an inch, and a transverse diameter of 1.1 of an inch. 

 The inferior molars are curved from without inwards, instead of laterally, as is 

 usual. The superior molars are curved to a degree intermediate to that of the 

 Equus caballus and Equus curvidens. 



The enamel folds are one-fourth thicker than in the recent horse and the 

 isolated enamel folds of the superior molars are much more plicated, resem- 

 bling in this respect the Equus plicidens, Owen. In one of the two superior 

 posterior molars, there is an additional or third isolated enamel fold, which 

 is oval, and two or three times larger than in the recent horse, and in the 

 other there is a fourth, small, round, isolated enamel fold. Both of these 

 teeth indicate a greater amount of room for development, and consequently a 

 larger jaw. Other and considerable differences will be noticed upon com- 

 paring the figures 2 and 3, representing the crowns of these teeth, especially 

 at the posterior part, which might lead to the supposition that they belonged 

 to distinct species, but from the general characters of the two specimens, 

 added to reasons before stated, relative to the amount of variation existing in 

 the corresponding tooth of the recent horse, I cannot but think they both be- 

 long to Equus Americanus.

It is straight, and although not longer than the corresponding tooth of the

Description of new species of Squalides from the Tertiary Beds of South Carolina. 

 By Robert VV. Gibbes, M. D., Columbia, S. C. 



1. Cap.charodon Mortoni. — I have only tvro specimens from the Eocene, 

 both broken. That, of which a cast is in the collection of the Academy, 

 was probably four inches deep, and three inches across the roots ; the upper 

 third is wanting. It is somewhat inequilateral — the anterior edge sloped in- 

 wards, and the posterior arched — both the outer and inner surfaces are con- 

 vex and prominent, the latter trebly so. The enamel is thin but strong — 

 cracked in striaj parallel to the edges, and as in most other species converging 

 and disappearing towards the apex : — it is sloped on the inner face. The 

 cutting edges are finely indented, the dentelures (if I may be allowed to adopt 

 an expressive word from the French) are very small, and more minute near 

 the base of the enamel. Next the edges on both faces is a longitudinal flat- 

 tening, giving the appearance of undulations. The root is immensely thick, 

 an inch and a half, and constitutes more than half of the bulk of the tooth. 

 The root is concave, but the extremities being broken, the form cannot be

given ; the structure of the dentine is not as compact as in C megalodon. 

 A partial description of this fine species was given in a previous paper 

 published in the Proceedings of the Academy, when I named it after the 

 distinguished pioneer of Tertiary Geology in the United States, Dr. Samuel 

 Geo. Morton. 



2. Carcharodon acutidens, — This beautiful species resembles C. angus- 

 tidens, Agassiz, but is very acutely pointed. Of four specimens which 

 are in my cabinet, the largest cone measures three inches, and it is more 

 than three times the depth of the root, which is concave, very thick and 

 prominent on the inner face. The body of the tooth, or enamelled portion 

 is conical, the lower third swollen, widest next the lateral denticles which 

 are distinct from it. The inner face is arched, while the outer is nearly flat, 

 though undulated by depression next the edges, and having a deep furrow 

 longitudinally in the middle near the base of the enamel, which extends to 

 the root. This does not extend as low on the inner face, and is sloped, 

 leaving an interspace next the root. The cutting edges are sharp and finely 

 indented, the serratures very close. Most of the specimens are straight, but 

 I have two which are oblique. There are examples of this species in the 

 Cabinet of the Academy. 



3. Carcharodon lanriformis. — Very flat, acutely pointed, triangular, nearly 

 equilateral, the posterior edge slightly sloped, while the anterior is straight. 

 The root is not much thicker than the base of the cone, very concave, the 

 rami not symmetrical, one being much longer than the other ; in the small 

 lateral teeth this, however, is scarcely perceptible. The edges are sharp and 

 finely indented ; the inner face elevated ; the outer plane, in some specimens 

 concave. Viewed laterally, some are much bowed or arched forward. In 

 the middle of the outer face near the base of the enamel, is a longitudinal 

 depression, the sides of which are elevated and unite above the horizontal 

 middle line, and form a ridge to the apex. It has lateral appendages, which 

 are not distinct from the principal cone. The enamel extends lower on the 

 outer face than on the inner. 



I have a series of specimens from the Eocene beds of Ashley and Cooper 

 rivers, S. C. 



4. OxYRHixA Desorii. — Prof. Agassiz described under this name specimens 

 which subsequent experience induces him to consider identical with Lamna 

 cuspldata, with which he had noticed a resemblance. 



I take pleasure in restoring the name of the distinguished M. Desor, the 

 friend and co-laboier of M. Agassiz, in this department of science, to a fine 

 species in my cabinet. 



It is very massive — thicker than any other of this genus — in this respect 

 resembling Oxyr. crassa, but not so broad. Viewed en projil, the form is 

 similar to Lamna Hopei, much curved inwardly, except near the apex, which 

 is flat. The edges are cutting in their whole extent, the base of the enamel 

 arched, and nearly equal on both faces, the root very thick, compaeV and 




2C«

heavy. I have six specimprin fmin the Miorenr, and three from tlie Eocen* 

 of South Carolina. 



5. OxYRHiNA Sil/imaiii. — Amorii: twelve specimens from the Eocene, there 

 is much uniformity in this species. The cone is straight or very slightly 

 bowed on the inner surface, equilateral, acutely pointed, both surfaces convex, 

 the inner much more so. A peculiarity exists in the great breadth of the 

 enamel at the base, which is similar on both aspects. The root is thick, and 

 forms one-third of the height of the tooth. 



I attach to it the name of Prof. B. Silliman, the veteran co-laborer in 

 American Science. 



6. Otodus levls. — Tliis has very much the form of Lamna cuspida'a, but the 

 position, form and size of tlie lateral wingletfl mark it as a true Otodus. It is 

 more slender than any other of this genus, laiiciform, equilateral, straight, 

 convex on the inner face, and undulated on the outer from a triangular 

 depression near the base extending longitudinally nearly to the apex. The 

 lateral cones are broad and thick, and detached from the base of the enan:el 

 which extends lower on the outer face than on the inner. I have a single 

 specimen from the Eocene, S. C. 



7. Glyphis subulata. — The cone is shorter and thicker proportionally than 

 in G. hnstalis, Agassiz, and is more straight, convex on both surfiices, 

 more so on the inner ; the upper third of the outer face is flat, and the point 

 has a tendency outward. A sharp lateral edge extends from the apex equally 

 on l)oth sides two-tliirds of tlie length of the cone, and is uniformly indented. 

 The root is thick, the enamel extends lower on the outer face and to the 

 root on both. In one specimen the root is very broad, and the enamelled 

 base equally so. 



I have only two specimens from the Eocene, S. C. 



I have in preparation full descriptions of all the genera and species of 

 Squalides from the Tertiary of South Carolina, which will be published with 

 figures in a future number of the Journal of the Academy. I have in my 

 collection eight genera and thirty-nine species. I have had the privilege and 

 pleasure of submitting them to the inspection of our distinguished visitor, 

 Prof. Agassiz, who has kindly and liberally given me much information as to 

 their character and arrangement, the result of his extensive experience.

The following letter was read from Dr. J. W. Dawson, of 

 Pictou, N. S., dated Sept. 11, '47, addressed to Prof. Johnson, 

 in answer to some inquiries made by the latter, respecting the 

 gypsum of that section of country. 



37 




272 [Oct. 1847. 



" The gjrpsnm of Nova Scotia lias attracted considerable attention since Mr. 

 Ji.vell published his reasons for supposing it to be older than had been previously 

 supposed, and you will find much matter relating to your inquiries, in papers 

 by Mr. Lyell, Mr. Brown of Sidney, and myself, published, within the last few 

 years, by the Geological Society of London. I do not, therefore, profess, in this 

 letter, to state much that is new, but merely to give you a general view of the 

 appearances I have observed, and the conclusions deducible from them. 



The great workable deposites of gypsum are all contained in the carboniferous 

 system, and most of them in its lower part. The new red sandstone contains 

 only small veins and thin layers of gypsum, of no economical importance. For 

 proof of this, I may refer you to the papers above mentioned, and to that on 

 the new red sandstone, which I hope will be published in the course of this year. 



The great masses of gypsum quarried in this Province, are the outcropping 

 edges of true beds, apparently as continuous as those of the limestone associated 

 with them, though perhaps not so much so as the accompanying sandstone and 

 .shale. These beds are, however, often of great thickness, and this, together 

 with the tendency of their surfaces to be worn into " pits," their association 

 with soft marls and sandstones easily removed by denudation, and the disturb- 

 ances to which our carboniferous strata have been subjected, often prevent their 

 arrangement from being distinctly seen. In the following places, however, it 

 is very evident : 



At Ogden's Point, near Antigonish, the descending order, seen in the coast 

 section, is as follows : 



1. White gypsum, fine grained and rather hard, in thick ) Aggregate 

 laminae, and with minute crystals of carbonate of lime. / thickness 



2. Reddish gypsum, large grained foliated. ) over 100 feet. 



3. Alternations of thin beds of gypsum and of grey earthy limestone. 



4. Grey limestone, laminated and brecciated, a thick bed. 

 .'). Reddish sandstones and shales. 



The dip of these beds is S. S. E. 25°, and the lamination or subordinate bed- 

 ding of the upper bed of gypsum, coincides with this dip. The beds can be 

 traced inland for several miles ; the outcrop of the gypsum running parallel 

 to that of the other beds. 



A section somewhat similar to the above, occurs at De Bert river, but there 

 the limestone, which is fossiliferous, does not alternate with the gypsum at 

 their junction ; the gypsum is, however, evidently a bed superimposed on 

 the limestone. 



Two of the smaller beds near the mouth of the Shubenacadie river, afford 

 good illustrations of the bedding of the gypsum. The first is a bed of black 

 gypsum, on the west side of the river. It is 12 feet thick, and is included in 

 beds of reddish sandstone, a layer of which separates the gypsum into two 

 portions. In this case the contrast between the color of the red sandstone and 

 that of the gypsum, apparently colored by coaly or bituminous matter, is very 

 striking. The other instance occurs on the east side of the river, at the south- 

 ern extremity of the bay, named the " Bend." It i^ a bed of whitish anhy- 

 drite, with some common gypsum in its upper part, regularly interstratified 

 with reddish sandstones. Near this bed the red sandstones are traversed by 

 a network of very narrow veins of fibrous gypsum. 




Oct. 1847.] 278 



Near the entrance of Wallace Harbor is a bed of gypsum, whose relations 

 are as follow, in descending order : 



1. Reddish clay or shale, not well seen. 



2. Grey limestone with fossil shells. Its fissures and the cavities of the 



shells filled with selenitic gypsum. 



3. White granular gypsum ; thickness about 12 feet. 



4. Reddish clay and shales. 



5. Grey sandstone, with calamites and trunks of coniferous trees. 

 The dip of these beds is S. S. W. 20°. 



The above are the best illustrations which, on looking over my notes, I can 

 find of the stratification of gypsum. There is, however, one circumstance 

 worthy of notice, in addition, as it aids in generalizing from such facts. It is 

 the rude lamination or layering observed in many masses of gypsum. This 

 always coincides with the plans of stratification, where the latter can be ob- 

 served, and is often produced by the presence of thin layers of clay, marl, or 

 limestone. In beds whose associated rocks cannot be seen, this lamination is 

 often observable, and affords an evidence of stratification, which may some- 

 times be farther confirmed by a comparison with the nearest visible beds ot 

 other rocks. In some cases also, this layering affords proofs of disturbances. 

 An instance of this is the enormous bed of gypsum, called White's or the Big 

 Plaster Rock, on the banks of the Shubenacadie. The indications of the 

 singularly contorted laminae of this bed are confirmed by the vertical position 

 of some associated thin beds of marl and limestone. 



Anhydrite very frequently accompanies the common gypsum. In some 

 cases, as at White's quarry, and the bend of the Shubenacadie, it forms the 

 lower parts of beds, which above consist of hydrous gypsum. In other instances, 

 as at the estuary of the Avon and the St. Croix river, it constitutes the mass of 

 greatbeds, which are, however, in the immediate vicinity of the beds of the com- 

 mon variety. At the East river of Pictou, it occurs in large balls, included in 

 a thick bed of hydrous gypsum. The anhydrite is sometimes also dissemi- 

 nated in grains, through some parts of the beds of gj'psum, which are quarried ; 

 and this mixed rock, as well as the purer anhydrite, is called hard plaster or 

 shark-stone, by the quarrymen. Anhydrite has not been observed to be con- 

 nected with any igneous or metamorphosed rocks. In the only instance which 

 I have observed of the occurrence of gypsum in rocks altered by heat, the 

 gypsum is hydrous. 



The gypsum of this province is nearly always crystalline. In the great beds, 

 whether of common gypsum or anhydrite, the structure is always foliated or 

 granular ; sometimes large grained, in other cases so fine as to appear compact 

 or chalky. The finer grained varieties often contain groups of larger crystals. 

 In the true veins, occupying fissures in the sandstones, limestones, and gypsum 

 beds themselves, the structure is invariably fibrous. Little rounded kernels of 

 gypsum, sometimes occurring in sandstones, &c., are foliated. 



The crystalline structure, and great comparative purity of gypsum, show that 

 it is a chemical, not a mechanical deposit. Its constant association with the 

 limestones of the carboniferous system, containing marine fossils, (Terebratula, 

 Productus, Orthoceras, Corals, &c.) prove that it was deposited in the sea; and 




•274 [Oct. 1847. 



from the present relations of the carboniferous rocks to older system?, in this 

 province, it is probable that the sea basins in which gypsum was deposited, 

 were not very extensive. In these sea basins the deposition of gypsum alter- 

 nated with mechanical deposits of sand and marl, and with the growtli of shells 

 and corals; but the conditions which produced beds of gypsum, were unfavora- 

 ble both to the transport of sediment and the existence of animals or plants. 



F;-om a consideration of these facts, I am disposed to refer the formation of 

 gypsum to springs and rivers, containing free sulphuric acid, and poured into 

 seas in which carbonate of lime had been deposited. The sulphuric acid may 

 have been derived from the volcanic regions of the neighboring ranges of older 

 rocks, and may have been a product of the oxidation of iron pyrites, which still 

 abound in some parts of these older strata, either directly by the action of air 

 and water, or, perhaps, indirectly by the formation of sulphuretted hydrogen, 

 and its oxidation in passing through fissures in contact with water and air. To 

 realize the operation of these causes, you need only imagine streams like the 

 South American Rio Vinaigre flowing into a sheltered bay containing beds of 

 shells and corals, or into the space between a coast and its coral reef. I do not, 

 however, pretend to explain the mode of former action of anhydrite in this 

 way, though it, like the common gypsum, has evidently been deposited in beds 

 by water."

 Woodpecker resembling Picm pubescens, but probably a new 

 species. This last is remarkable in having only three toes, and 

 would therefore more probably belong to the genus Picoides Lacep. 

 [AjJteriius, Swains.) The feet are slender and delicate, without 

 even a rudiment of a fourth toe ; in other respects it more closely 

 resembles the -P. meridionalis, Swains. (P. Gairdnerii, Aud. ) 

 which is also an inhabitant of Georgia. It differs in having the 

 bill more compressed at the base, the tips of the tertiaries with- 

 out emarginations, the primaries narrower and more pointed, and 

 in the toes being only three in number.

Description of a New Species of Coluber inhabiting the United States. 



By Eiiward Hallowell, M. D, 



Coluber venustus. 



Characters. — Head small, neck slender, color reddish-brown, with a dorsal 

 ash-colored band extending from the occiput to near the extremity of the tail ; 

 four narrow bands of reddish-brown color from the neck to the commencement 

 of the tail, with two intermediate bands of the same color, but less distinct ; 

 an ash-colored, band resembling tbat ujwn the dorsum, along each side of 

 the abdomen ; abdomen of a brick-red or copper color ; tail short. 



Description. — Head small, elongated, flattened above, covered with nine

plates ; of these the vertical is pentagonal ; the occipital are also pentagonal, 

 their anterior margins being in contact with the vertical, supra-orbitar, and 

 superior post-occular plates ; the supra-orbitar are pentangular, and in contact 

 posteriorly with the occipital and posterior superior post-oculai'S, internallj with 

 the vertical, and anteriorly with the posterior frontal ; their external margin 

 forms the upper part of the orbit, and is in contact in front with the superior 

 ante-ocular ; they do not project beyond the e^'e ; the posterior frontal are 

 quadrilateral ; the anterior frontal are smaller than those last described ; theii 

 external and posterior angle is somewhat prolonged, passing in between the 

 frenal and the posterior frontal plate ; their anterior margin is rounded ; there 

 are two ante-ocular, and two post-oculars, of the posterior the superior is the 

 larger ; the frenal plate is quadrilateral ; the nasal is single ; the nostril, which 

 is small, is placed near the posterior margin ; the rostral plate is hexagonal, 

 incurvated below ; it is in contact with the anterior frontal, the nasal and the an- 

 terior labials ; in the specimen examined there are six superior labials on one 

 side and seven upon the opposite side of the head, exclusive of the rostral : 

 of these the fifth is the largest ; it is oblong quadrilateral ; eyes of moderate 

 size, placed upon the side of the head ; neck slender, body rounded, contracted 

 near the anus, thickest near the middle, covered with carinated scales ; of these 

 there are fifteen rows ; these scales are bi-punctate posteriorly ; the interven- 

 ing epidermis is black ; tail short and tapering to a point. 



Colour. — Head brown above; irides . An ash-coloured band extends along 



the dorsum, beginning at the occiput ; it is narrow upon the neck, and broadest 

 near the middle of the animal, where it measures one line and a quarter in 

 breadth ; it becomes narrow xipon the tail, and is finally lost towards its ex- 

 tremity ; two longitudinal bands of a reddish-brown colour extend along each 

 side from the neck to the tail, the superior along the external margin of the 

 ash-coloured dorsal band, the inferior along the lateral margin of the abdominal 

 scuta ; there is an intermediate band of the same colour, but less distinct ; the 

 spaces intervening between the bands are light brown ; the chin is white, pre- 

 senting numerous small conglomerate spots of a black colour upon its surface ; 

 the throat is also white, with blackish points, most numerous upon its sides ; 

 the neck, abdomen and under part of tail are of a trick-red colour ; lighter 

 upon the neck ; an d,sh-coloured band, resembling that upon the back, extends 

 along each side of the neck, and of the abdomen as far as the tail. 



Dimensions. — Length of head 4 lines ; greatest breadth 2^ lines ; length of 

 body 9 inches, (Fr.) of tail, 2 inches 5 lines. 



Abdomen. — Scuta 122. Subcaud. 41. 



Habitat. — Michigan, near Copper Harbour, Lake Superior. This species 

 was found by Mr. Theodore F. Moss, between stones upon the border of the 

 lake, and presented by him to tbe Acadamy of Natural Sciences. The speci- 

 men had been preserved in alcohol two weeks. 



No animal resembling the one I have described is figured in Prof. Holbrook's 

 work on the "Reptiles inhabiting the United States," and I have therefore 

 ventured to consider it as new. 



Since the figure of this animal was printed, I have received, through the

280 [Oct. 1847. 



kiudueas of Dr. Storer, the original of the occipitoviaculattu,* which corres- 

 ponds with the .animal descrihcd in many partiuiilars. Tlie form of the liead 

 and neck is the same, as are also the plates imme'iiately in front of the eye, 

 which are two in number, the Tripidonntns Dikaijl, with which it ha,s been 

 considered identical, presenting but one. The scales are likewise carinated and 

 bi-punctate posteriorly, and the number of caudal and abdominal plates is 

 aearly the same in both. The specimen of Dr. Storer, however, is much more 

 slender, and the coloration is almost totally different, which, however, may 

 be the effect of long immersion in spirits. We are inclined to the opinion, 

 therefore, that notwithstanding the great difference in their size and coloration, 

 the two animals are the same. 



My friend Prof. Baird, to whom I exhibited tlie specimen brought by Mr. 

 Mo.ss, states that it is very abundant in the north, being, in fact, the most 

 common snake along Lake Champlain. In Troy, he observes, " I have found 

 one, and have a specimen from Georgia, at least given me as from that local- 

 ity." It is certainly remarkable, that an animal having so wide a geograph- 

 ical distribution, and presenting the beautiful appearance which it does, should 

 lie $0 little known to natiiralists. 



The Committee on Mr. Conrad's paper, read 12th inst., re- 

 ported in favour of publication in the Proceedings. 



Observations on the Eocene formation, and descriptions of one hundred and five 



new fossils of that period, from the vicinity of Vicksburg, Mississippi, with an 



Appendix. 



By T. A. Conrad. 



la the Spring of 1844, I collected about 109 species of Eocene fossils, most 

 of which appear to be new species. There are 60 univalves, 42 bivalves, and 

 1 multivalve shell, and 6 or 7 polyps. 



Of these fossils, I can identify two only with species of the Claiborne sands, 

 Irfundibulum trochiformis aud Conus saurodens. Very few others are related to 

 species of the Alabama sand strata ; Lucina Mississippi<:nsis, Sigaretus Missis- 

 sippiensis and Dentalium Mississippi ensis, are the only shells which might be 

 confounded with species of those deposits. 



The Vicksburg group contains three species of bivalves which have much 

 resemblance to Miocene fossils of this country. Lima staminea approaches L. 

 papyria; Cor6(//a en^onate is allied to C inequalis, Say ; and Xucula Vicks- 

 buri^ensis, to N. obliqua. Say. 



I have not observed a recent species in this group, and yet it is decidedly 

 more modern than that of the Claiborne sands : and as both deposits have but 

 two species in common, I thought it advisable to designate the former. Upper 

 or Newer Eocene, and the latter Lower or Older Eocene, as the two divisions 

 are more distinct than the Older and Newer Pliocenes. 



In the American Journal of Science and Arts, I have given a sketch of the 



* Reports on the Icthyology and Herpetology of Massachusetts, by D. Hum- 

 phreys Storer, M. D., p. 230.

Mississippi Eocene, and observed that not* more than 10 species would be fouad, 

 on comparison, identical with Claiborne shells. I had reference to the sand at 

 Claiborne, and not including the limestone above it. A careful comparison hae 

 reduced the number to two species, for the Dentalium, which when at Vicks- 

 burg (without a Claiborne specimen for comparison) I had supposed to be D. 

 (haUoides, is a distinct, though closely allied species. 



This newer portion of the Eocene in Mississippi is represented in Alabama 

 by the white limestone at St. Stephens on the Tombeckbe river, and the simi- 

 lar rock which constitutes the uppermost stratum at Claiborne, on the Alabama 

 river ; all being admirably connected by the abundance of Nummulites Manttlli. 

 There is a similar limestone in Charleston County, South Carolina, in which I 

 found Scutella Lyelli and Pecten calvatus, fossils of the Claiborne limestone, 

 and both rocks are probably of the same geological age. The limestone of 

 Tampa Bay, Florida, is included in the Upper Eocene series, but as yet no 

 fossil has been obtained from it identical with a species of the Carolinas, Mis- 

 sissippi or Alabama, unless it is a specimen of Carcharias meyalodon. which 

 Capt. Powell, of the Navy, found on the bay shore. 



The only species of Crassatella which occurs at Vicksburg, is more nearly re- 

 lated to C. tumida of the Paris basin than to C, alia of Claiborne. 



Oslrea sellce/ormis characterises the lower division of the Eocene formation. 

 It occurs abundantly beneath the fossiliferous sands of Claiborue ; at Vance's 

 Ferry, South Carolina: and on the right bank of James river, below City 

 Point, Virginia. I also refer to this section, the localities at Fort Washington, 

 Piscataway, and Upper Marlborough, Maryland. Other characteristic fossils 

 are Cardila planicosta and Turritella Mortoni, the former occurring at Piscata- 

 way ; at Claiborne, Alabama: and also at Marlbourne, on Pamunkey river.

 contain ppccies of organic remains identical with tliosc of the Lower Eocene of 

 Alabaroa and Virginia, none of which has yet been found associated with the 

 two characteristic fossils above named. On the other hand, the OstrK-a Georgi- 

 ana occurs at Jackson, Mississippi, where its position is said to be below the 

 Vicksburg group. It is therefore the line of demarcation between the Upper 

 and Lower Eocene.

 ly, and with revolving lines; ribs curved, undulated on the body whorl and 

 subnodose above; body whorl gibbous ; aperture narrow ; callus cf the labium

1. Triton crassidens, 



Subfusiform, a little distorted ; spire acuminated ; whorls latticed, the 

 longitudinal ridges rather distant, prominent; body whorl with the longitu-

 plaits, the middle one largest ; canal long. Length 5 inches. 



The young of this species has distinct lines on every part of the shell, ex- 

 cept on the large portion of the body whorl, where they are indistinct and re- 

 mote. This species is named to commemorate the scientific zeal of Dr. Thomas 

 B. Wilson. It is rare, and generally very imperfect.

 mental ; aperture narrow ; labrum striated within : columella with two large 

 plaits; beak long and narrow. Length 1. 



Distinguished from the preceding by its narrower outline, fewer and larger 

 plaits on the pillar, &c. It is probably a much smaller species, but as I have 

 one specimen only, its greatest size cannot be determined.

Descriptions of New Eocene Fossils in the Cabinet o/Lardner VaNUXHsi. 



The following organic remains were obtained from Eocene rocks in St. Mat- 

 thew's Parish, Orangeburg District, S. C, by Lardner Yanuxem. 



1. Nucula mucronata . 



Elliptical, convex in the middle, with equal, laminated, not closely- arranged 

 lines, about seventeen in number ; anterior side longest, the end acutely pointed ; 

 a submarginal furrow emarginates the base; posterior side slightly contracted, 

 end obtusely rounded or subtruncated. Length 9-10. Height 5. 



2. Nucula carolinensis. 



Somewhat elliptical, convex, with rather closely-arranged prominent concen- 

 tric lines, wanting on the posterior side, which is rather shorter that the an- 

 terior and regularly rounded at the end ; anterior submargin with a narrow 

 groove, bounded^by a subcarinated line ; anterior side narrowed and rather ob- 

 tuse at the end. Length^. Height^. 



3. Nucula subtrigona, 



Subtriangular, ventricose, nearly equilateral, with numerous prominent con- 

 centric lines ; anterior side pointed, flexuous ; submargin angulated : anterior 

 margin sinuous, end angular ; ligament margin straight ; basal margin pro- 

 foundly rounded. Length f. Height k nearly. 



4. Nucula calcarensis.. 



Subovate, ventricose, with minute closely-arranged concentric lines ; ante- 

 rior side longest, pointed, slightly recurved, without a submarginal groove or 

 fold; base profoundly rounded. Length 7-16. Height}. 



1. Cardita vigintinaria. 



Suborbicular, inequilateral, ventricose, with about thirty square radii, about 

 as wide as the interstices ; umbonial slope rounded ; anterior margin subtrun- 

 cated. Length 7-8. Height 7-8. 



2. Cardita carolinenm. 



Suborbicular? profoundly ventricose, with about thirty very prominent 

 square radii, on the anterior side sharp, recurved and crenulated ; lunnle very 

 broad and cordate, deeply impressed; hinge thick; pit anterior to the cardi- 

 nal tooth small and profound. 



This is a fragment of the right valve, about 5-8ths of an inch long. 



3. Cardita bilineata. 



Subrhomboidal, very inequilateral, with about twenty-four wide, flattened 

 radii, with very narrow interstices, a carina in the middle of each rib, with 

 an impressed line on each side of it ; ribs crenulated anteriorly ; carina some- 

 what tuberculated on the posterior side of the shell. Length ^. Height 9-16. 




298 [Oct 1847. 



4. CardUa subquadrata. 



Trapezoidal, compressed ; valves flattened in the middle ; radii about twentv- 

 five, broad on the disk, with very narrow interstices, and each rib with a crenu- 

 lated carina in the middle ; posterior to umbonial slope the ribs are smooth, not 

 carinated ; anterior side short, rounded at the end; posterior margin obliquelr 

 truncated. Length 6-10. Height 7-20.

 volving lines ; suture profound. A fragment. Width §. 



Infundibuluvi carinatum. 



Depressed, with a suddently elevated acutely conical spire, and a carinated 

 line revolving at the suture. Length of fragment f. 



All the preceding fossils are from the Eocene rocks of St. Matthew's Parish, 

 Orangeburg District, S. C. Not one species of this locality is known in the 

 lower Eocene of Claiborne or elsewhere, nor in the upper Eocene of Vicksbnrg, 

 and therefore the relative age of the deposit is uncertain, but it unquestionably 

 belongs to the Eocene period. Near this rock Mr. Vanuxem found quite a dif- 

 ferent class of shells, consisting of casts in indurated clay. The relative posi- 

 tion is undetermined. Two of the shells are described and named Tellina sub- 

 equalis and Lutraria petrosa. 



Tellina subequalis. 



Somewhat elliptical, nearly equilateral; posterior end acutely rounded ; an- 

 terior slightly bent, end rounded. (A cast.) Length IJ. Width |. 



Madrepora punctulata. 



Cylindrical, ramose with prominent cells ; whole surface ornamented with 

 fine, equal, punctate, impressed lines. Diameter J. 



Locality. St. Mathew's Parish, Orangeburg, S. C. Vanuxem. 



A species highly ornamented by the punctate vermicular lines. It occurs 

 much larger than the speeimen described. 



In Vanuxem's collection there is a cast, from the Eocene near Long Branch, 




Oct. 1847.] 299 



N. J., resembling Xautilus zigzag, (Sow.) It is more compressed than tbat 

 species, and the angles of the septa appear to be in contact near the periphery. 

 It is more like a Goniatite than a Nautilus, and may properly constitute a 

 genus, which I propose to name Nautilopsis. 



Nautilopsis Vanuxemi. 

 Length 2|. Diameter 1 5-16. 

 N. zig-zag may be referred to the same genus. 



The Society, in accordance with the resohition adopted at last 

 meeting for business, proceeded to the election of a Recording 

 Secretary in the place of Mr. Moss, resigned — when Mr. John 

 Lambert was unanimously elected. 



A letter was read from Mr. Wm. C. Redfield, dated New York, 

 Oct. 19, 1847, requesting the loan of the Westfield specimens of 

 fossil fish, in the collection of the Academy, for the purpose of 

 description by Mr. Agassiz, in his Memoir on the American 

 Fossil Fishes from the New Red Sandstone, now in course of 

 preparation. 



On motion, the By-law relating to the loan of specimens from 

 the Museum, was temporarily suspended, and the request of Mr. 

 Redfield complied with by the Society, under proper restrictions. 



ELECTION. 



Messrs. Charles Lennig, J. Dickinson Sergeant, Edward M. 

 Kern, Charles Klemm, and Prof. James B. Rogers, all of Phila-

A paper containing a description of a new Utiio, by Mr. 




Nov. 1847.] 313 



Haldeman, was read and referred to a committee consisting 

 of Dr. Griffith, Dr. Wilson, and Mr. Phillips. 



Dr. Leidy made the following remarks upon the very slow 

 destrnctibility of animal tissues in certain states. 



The great length of time that animal matter may be preserved 

 in a recent form, in ice, is so well known as hardly to need refe- 

 rence to the instance of the Siberian mammoth. 



Bones and teeth, under ordinary circumstances, resist the in- 

 fluence of exterior agencies better than any of the other tissues, 

 and then follow epidermic tissue, fibrous tissue, &c. Bones of the 

 mastodon have long since been determined to contain almost as 

 much gelatin as those of recent animals, and I have lately detect- 

 ed, by chemical analysis, the existence of animal matter in a por- 

 tion of a vertebra of the Basilosaurus, a fossil of the Eocene tertia- 

 ry period. A portion of this animal matter, preserved in alcohol, 

 I exhibit to the Academy. It has a flocculent appearance, con- 

 tains no gelatin, but readily carbonizes and takes fire, giving out 

 an odour characteristic of burning animal substances; the ash it 

 leaves behind contains a large proportion of oxide of iron. 



If not exposed to the influence of air and moisture, bones will 

 retain their animal matter for an indefinite period of time. We 

 have, in the collection of the Academy, bones of the extinct 

 Megalonyx, from White Cave, Tennessee, which look as fresh as 

 though prepared but yesterday. But when they are exposed to 

 air, and to alternations of dryness and moisture, or a constant but 

 slightly moistened state, without the presence of carbonate of 

 lime, silex, or oxide of iron, which tend rather to the preserva- 

 tion than destruction of the animal matter contained in them, the 

 animal matter is gradually and almost wholly removed, leaving 

 nothing but the earthy constituents, which, if they do retain the 

 original form, readily crumble to pieces from the slightest vio- 

 lence. Of the softer animal tissues, the preservation of insects 

 in amber, a resin belonging to a very ancient flora, is well 

 known. But one of the most remarkable instances occurring 

 under ordinary circumstances, which has been presented to my 

 notice, is the existence of portions of fibrous membrane and 

 articular cartilage, attached to some of the bones of the Megalonyx 

 before spoken of, as exhibited in these specimens. By ex- 

 amining this piece of fibrous membrane, taken from one of the 

 bones, it will be found to have retained all the characteristics of 

 perfectly recent membrane ; it imbibes moisture and becomes as 

 flexible as if fresh. The articular cartilage has become hard and 

 brittle and yellow in colour, and looks like resinous matter. A 

 fragment beneath the microscope presented all the characters of 




314 [Nov. 1S47. 



that form of cartilage, .13 represented in this drawing, which I 

 took from it. The cartilage corpuscles are well preserved and 

 very distinct. By soaking it in water it does not become tough 

 and flexible, as in recent cartilage, but swells up and forms a 

 thick jelly, which, after a few hours, dissolves in the water, and 

 colours it yellow. A change has taken place in it, correspond- 

 ing to that which occurs in most organic tissues when constantly 

 kept in the dry state. The atoms or molecules undergo a change 

 of relation in regard to each other, or new chemical combinations 

 take place without destroying the form of the dried object, but 

 destroying the power of its resuming its original form. The 

 change is an exceedingly slow one; in many instances, after 

 centuries have elapsed, no perceptible change has taken place. 

 An instance in point was lately presented to us by Dr. Morton, 

 who put a dried ear of an Egyptian mummy of the time of the 

 Pharaohs, into water, in the hope that it would resume its former 

 proportions, but instead of so doing, for a few days it appeared to 

 undergo no chL,nge, except colouring the water yellow, as in the 

 case of the articular cartilage of the Megalonyx. It then sudden- 

 ly underwent rapid decomposition, and in the course of a day 

 entirely disappeared ; the solution for two days exhaled a putrid 

 odour, which then disappeared, leaving the fluid coloured yellow 

 and without further chance. 



A report was presented from the committee appointed on 

 the subject of exclianges with M. Vattemare, proposing 

 to forward to him for works lately received two copies of 

 Vols. 1 and 2 of the Proceedings; and also to place in his 

 hands for further exchanges, additional copies of the same, 

 which was accordingly ordered.

The following extract from a letter from Prof, Haldeman, 

 dated 11th November, 1847, was read. 



" Herpetologists now suppose that Salamandra erythronota, 

 Green, and S. cinerea, Green, are opposite sexes of the same 

 species. The two are frequently found under the same stone 

 or log, but I have never seen one with intermediate characters. 

 I recently found six individuals and submitted them to dissection. 

 Four of cinerea, opened successively, proved to have gravid 

 ovaries, and two of ert/thronota to be males ; but to be certain, I 

 submitted the secjinal matter to microscopic examination, and 

 found spermatozoa, although not fully developed. Subsequently 

 I found two erythronota with gravid ovaries, so that not being 

 sexual, and no intermediate forms having been observed, I am 

 induced to believe that Green was right in proposing two species."

Those Fossils were found in one part of the mine only, scat- 

 tered over an area of three or four acres, in some places so thick 

 that five or six might be found in one square yard. They lie in 

 the Shaie Roof immediately in contact with the Coal Scam.

 their membranes of carbonaceous matter, and small pipes of Iron 

 Pyrites terminating in scars on the external surface, supposed to 

 be seed culls. I cannot find any decribed fossils resembling 

 thom more nearly than the Fruit of Podocarya from the oolite, 

 in Auckland's Bridgewatcr Treatise.

Professor Johnson exhibited a specimen of a boiler sediment 

 derived from a steam boiler used at Burlington, New Jersey, 

 which uses clear spring water. It is dark brown, has a specific 

 gravity of 1.235, contains 34.88 per cent, of earthy residue, and 

 (55.12 per cent., of combustible material, melting only at 900 — 

 1000 degrees, though it softens at 260, and exhales an empy- 

 reumatic odour at 430*^ ; and at 450^^ becomes reddish-brown and 

 brittle. The sediment pulverized and boiled in alcohol gave, by 

 slow evaporation, an oily substance, which separates in a white 

 hydrated condition — but the water is lost below the boiling point 

 of alcohol, leaving the oil a reddish-brown, capable of softening 

 at ISO'', and becoming fluid at 180°. The earthy matter contains 

 carbonate of lime and magnesia, as well as silicate of alumina 

 and oxide of iron. 



Prof. Johnson also oflTered some observations on the fossil 

 bones from Dr. Joel Y. Shelly, deposited this evening, which, 

 from the appearance of the rock adhering to the specimens,

enclosed in a sheath; thirteen plates margin tbenpper jaw on the right, and 

 fourteen on the left side of the head, exclusive of the rostral; the tenth on 

 the right, and the eleventh on the left side are the largest ; the shape of both 

 is pentangular ; the rostral plate is also pentangular,and incurvated inferiorly; 

 there are sixteen plates along the margin of the lower jaw, exclusive of the 

 mental, which is broad and triangular ; the anterior geneials are oblong 

 quadrilateral, the posterior, large and rbomboidal. Ifcck contracted, quite 

 slender compared with the body, which is somewhat cylindrical and very 

 thick in the middle, becoming slender towards the tail ; tail quite short ; 

 upper part and sides of neck, body and tail covered with very strongly 

 carinated scales ; many of these scales are truncated posteriorly. 



Color. — Upper part of head light brown ash color ; a dark colored 

 triangular blotch exists upon the side of the head, its apex touching the 

 posterior margin of the orbit ; another dark colored blotch, an inch in 

 length, extends along the margin of the lower jaw ; chin and throat light 

 straw color, with numerous small black spots. A series of oblong quad- 

 rangular bands extends along the dorsum, commencing at the neck, and is 

 lost upon the tail ; in the young subject they are bordered with white ; at 

 each extremity is a dark triangular blotch, the apices of which touch each 

 other: a row of dark colored triangular blotches is also observed along the 

 margins of the quadrangular bars, contiguous with which are other triangu- 

 lar spots, having their bases toward each other; these are not represented 

 in the figure ; there is also a row of triangular spots upon each side of the 

 body, in contact with the abdomen : abdomen and under surface of tail 

 straw color, presenting numerous spots of black. 



Dimensions. — Length of head 2 inches, 3 lines (Fr.) ; breadth posteriorly, 

 2 inches ; length of tail, 5 inches 3 lines ; length of body, 2 feet 8^ inches 

 (Fr.) ; greatest circumference of body, 8 inches 3 lines. 



Abdominal scuta 128 ; Subcaudal 27, two of which are single, (the second 

 and third from the anus,) the rest bifid. 



Habitat. — Liberia, Western Africa. Specimen in the Museum of the 

 Academy. 



General Observations. — The animal from which the above description 

 is taken, was presented to the Academy of Natural Sciences by Dr. 

 Thomas S. Savage, Colonial Physician, and one of our Correspondents. 

 The drawing was taken from a young animal, eighteen inches in length : 

 the coloration, however, does not vary materially from that of the 

 older specimen, except that the general tints are lighter, and in the points 

 indicated. It has no resemblance to the Vipera cornuta, Auct., a beauti- 

 ful figure of which is given in Dr. Andrew Smith's Illustrations of the Zoo- 

 logy of Southern Africa, plate 32.* 



There can be no doubt, we think, that this is the animal figured by Shaw, 



* See Schlegel, Physiognomies des Serpens, torn. ii. p. 583, note.

and described under the name of Coluber nasicomis. The figure of Shaw 

 does not represent the triangular spots at the extremities and sides of the 

 quadrangular bars upon the back, and the form of the head is altogether differ- 

 ent ; he states, however, that " along the whole length of the back, is placed 

 a series of yellowish brown oblong spots or marks, each of which is imbedded 

 in a patch of black," which, although a somewhat loose description, evidently 

 refers to the species under consideration. Many of the drawings in his Zoo- 

 logy, it is well known, are exceedingly incorrect. It is remarkable that an 

 animal so hideous, and provided with weapons so destructive, should possess 

 the beautiful robe which it presents to the eye. Why this animal, and others 

 among the reptilia, should be thus endowed, is a mystery ; for, judging 

 from its formidable head, and powerful fangs, no reptile, not even the 

 Crotalus, or Trigonocephalus, is so deadly. It is also remarkable that ani- 

 mals of this kind should exist in tropical countries associated with the most 

 beautiful of Flora's productions.

An account of the habits of this, as well as those of other animals recently 

 presented by him to the Academy, has been promised by Dr. Savage.

The Committee on Dr. Leidy's description of a new genus 

 and species of Fossil Ruminants, reported in favor of publi- 

 cation ; 



On a netv genus and species of fossil Ruminantia : Poebkothkrium Wilsom. 

 By Joskph Leidy, M. D. 



Indirectly, through Mr. J. S. Philipa and the influence of Dr. S. G. Morton, 

 the Academy has become the depository of a valuable and unique fossil, 

 received through Dr. S. D. Culbenson, of Chambersburg, Pa., from Mr. 

 Joseph Culbertson. 



As first received, it consisted of a mass of argillaceous limestone, having 

 one side of a cranium of an animal exposed to view, which, by the patience 

 of Dr. T. 13. Wilson, was relieved of its matrix, and the lower extremity 

 of the humerus, and the upper extremity of the ulna and the radius of the 

 right leg were also disclosed. 



The top or vault above the orbits and posterior part of the cranium are 

 wanting, as are also the ossa nasi, ossa intermaxillaria, the part of the oe 

 maxillare inferius just anterior to the commencement of the symphysis, and 

 the zygoma of the left side, but sufficient is left to charcterize it as a remark- 

 able genus o{ Ruminantia, very different from any that has been heretofore 

 described. 



The cranium belonged to a full grown or adult animal, but not an old 

 one, as is indicated by the teeth. 



In the upper jaw are seven molars, differing in this respect from any 

 ruminant known, living or fossil. The posterior three molars, usually called 

 true, present nothing very peculiar in their conformation. They are not so 

 square as in Cervus, but are more like those of Ovis, being much broader 

 than wide, so that they have a compressed appearance. The four crescents 

 upon the crowns are quite simple. Externally these teeth present two and 

 nearly plane surfaces, separated by an abrupt, salient, longitudinal ridge on 

 a line with the notch separating the anterior and posterior pair of columns. 

 Each of these surfaces has a longitudinal rounded ridge, more prominent 

 upon the anterior than the posterior one, but neither so salient as the first. 

 The antero-external border is also elevated or prominent, so that each of 

 these teeth presents externally four longitudinal ridges. As is usual, these 

 teeth are obliquely situated in the jaw, and the anterior part of one folds 

 over externally or overlaps the posterior part of the one preceding it. 



The anterior four molars or premolars are not more than half the length 

 of the true molars, and differ among themselves so as to render it necessary 

 to examine them separately. The posterior or fourth premolar has more the 

 characteristics of a true molar, and it would probably not be wrong to con- 

 sider it as an additional true molar. The crown presents four crescents, 

 which are thicker than in the true molars, and the anterior and posterior 

 pair are separated by a comparatively deeper notch. Externally the tooth 




Nov. 1847,] 323 



has four ridges corresponding to those of the true molars. The third pre- 

 molar, or the one immediately preceding the last, has upon its crown a 

 posterior pair of thick crescents, and an anterior cusp which has the appear- 

 ance of being formed by the blending together of a pair of crescents. Ex • 

 ternally it is trilobed, the lobes being separated by two concave depressions. 

 It is shorter but broader than the last. The second premolar is com- 

 pressed, faintly trilobed, and presents an elongated trenchant crown. The 

 first premolar is the most remarkable characteristic of this cranium. It 

 13 separated from the others by a concave notch of .333 of an inch, and is 

 on a line with the anterior mental foramen. It is implanted in the jaw by 

 two fangs, which are divergent and placed one anterior to the other. The 

 body is nearly as broad as the second premolar and is of a compressed pyra- 

 midal form, and the crown has a trenchant edge, the posterior and anterior 

 part of which form an angle about its centre. 



In the lower jaw, in the specimen, are sis inferior molars in a closed 

 row commencing .25 of an inch anterior to the corresponding six molars 

 above, and continuing as far back as the latter. Besides these, and separated 

 from them by a concave descending notch of .45 of an inch, just anterior 

 to the anterior mental foramen, or .15 of an inch anterior to the commence- 

 ment of the sympyhsis posteriorly, is one half of an alveolus for an addi- 

 tional or seventh molar, which, when the specimen was first received, con- 

 tained a portion of a fang, since mislaid. This additional molar in the 

 lower jaw is possessed by only one other known genus oi Ruminaiiiia ; the 

 Dorcalherium, of Kaup. 



The crowns of the inferior molars are enveloped in the matrix in such a 

 manner that they cannot be exposed without endangering the specimen. 

 Externally the three true molars present their columns as sharply triangu- 

 lar prisms, as in Ovis, &c., and have no intervening points or cones, as in 

 Cervus, Dorcatherium, Sfc. 



The fourth premolar is tri-lobed externally, each lobe presenting a cusp 

 towards the crown. The third and second are compressed, and the latter. 

 I can perceive, has a trenchant crown. 



The position of the molars, though resembling that of Dorcatherium, con- 

 siderably more than that of any other genus of Euminatilia, differs materially 

 from it, for while the teeth reach to the symphysis in the latter, in the for- 

 mer they even extend anteriorly to its commencement. 



From the foregoing description of the teeth, it will be perceived, that in 

 the possession of a seventh molar in the upper jaw, in the position of the 

 molars, and in several other minor peculiarities, this genus differs from all 

 others heretofore known, and is well characterized, and I therefore propose 

 tor it the name of," Poebrotuerium."* 



The base of the maxilla inferius presents a double curve, and has its an- 

 terior, central, and posterior parts very nearly on the same line, so as to 

 give the lower part of the face an unusual degree of squareness. The angle 

 is prolonged upwards and backwards into a well marked and hook-like pro- 



* von herba, flfoat pasco, 9-ii/) fera. ' 




324 Nov. 1847. 



cess similar to tbat of many RoJentia and Carnivorn, and exists in no other 

 Ruminantia excepting the Camdidoi. Just above the base, where it curves 

 downwards and bacliwards, is a short crescentic depression made by the 

 attachment of the masseter muscle. The processus coronoideus has been 

 proportionately about as long as that of the Ovin aries. The depression be- 

 tween the processus coronoideus and condyloideus upon the outer face of 

 the ramus is comparatively deep, resembling more that of a carniverons 

 than a ruminating animal. The anterior mental foramen is i)laced im- 

 mediately posterior to the commencement of the symphisis. About one inch 

 and a half to posterior to the latter foramen, on a line with the separation 

 of the Grit true and last premolar, is another and smaller foramen, which 

 is common to most Ruminants. 



The os3a maxillaria snperiora, below the situation of the ossa nasi, are 

 very much depressed, so as to make this part of the face extremely narrow. 

 Just anterior to this depression is a prominence resembling that produced 

 by the root of the canine tooth of the Moschus, although I doubt very much 

 whether this animal had such large canine teeth, if it had any at all, because 

 of the very great narrowness of this part of the face, and the very advanced 

 position of the first premolar. 



The infra orbitar foramen is further back or more approached to the orbit 

 than usual, being situated on a line above the fourth premolar. 



The anterior part of the orbit is elevated so that the latter looks directly 

 outwards. 



The body of the os malas is narrowed and elongated backwards. The 

 zygoma proper, or that which is posterior to the frontal process of the 

 OS malae, is short. 



The meatus auditorius externus borders immediately upon the glenoid 

 cavity. The tympanic bone is inflated and comparatively larger than in 

 Bos bovis, Cervus rufescens, or any other Ruminant with which I am ac- 

 quainted. Externally it projects beyond the face of the lower jaw and the 

 meatus externus. Viewed posteriorly, it presents two parallel ampullae, 

 united anteriorly, and separated posteriorly by a notch, whiih terminates 

 in a deep depression below for accommodating the processus styloideus. 



The portion of os humeri, consisting of the articular surface for the elbow 

 and posterior sigmoid cavity, presents nothing peculiar. 



The ulna, where it is broken off about three-fourths of an inch below the 

 articulation, has nearly the same thickness as the radius, and probably has 

 been proporlionaLely larger than usual. 



These bones belonged to an animal rather less in size than the Dorca- 

 thertum. 



The species I have designated Wilso7n, in honor of Dr. Thomas B- 

 Wilson, the munificent patron of the Natural Sciences. 



Probable habit of the animal. — From the evidences of considerable mus- 

 cular strength in the posterior part of the inferior maxilla and the trenchant 

 crowns of the anterior premolars, it might be supposed that the animal was 

 adapted to eating flesh as part of its food, as was thought by Cuvier to have 

 been probably the case with the Anoplotherium gracile, a pachydermous ani-

mal having very similar characters, but I should think its general structure 

 would entirely preclude the idea of its having been able to catch living 

 animal prey, and doubt very much whether its food could have been other 

 than vegetable. The anterior trenchant molars were more probably in- 

 tended for cutting branches and twigs of bushes, or tough grasses, which 

 afterward underwent a finer trituration with the true molars. 



The, position which the genus should occupy. — Poebrotherium in its denti- 

 tion approaches the Rumiyiantia to the Pachydermata, for in the number of the 

 molar teeth and the trenchant nature of the anterior premolars it is closely 

 allied to the Xiphodant Anoplotherium, while in the true molars it is charac- 

 teristically Ruminant, and its position would, therefore, probably stand thus : 

 Dorcatherium, Poebrotherium^ Anoplotherium.

Dr. Morton made some remarks on an Indian cranium of 

 singular form found near Richruond, on the Delaware; and 

 also on a Chenook infant mummy. The cranium is interest- 

 ing on account of its locality, and from its having the atlas 

 vertebra continuous with the occipital bone. No trace of 

 suture is visible ; although the skull has pertained to an indi- 

 vidual not exceeding 25 years of age. 



The Chenook mummy is from the Straits of Fuca ; the 

 head is artificially compressed in a very remarkable manner, 

 according to the custom of these people.

Tail very long, graduated, the two middle feathers exceeding all the others 

 by several inches ; all the tail feathers largely tipped with white. 



Total length (of skin) from tip of bill to end of tail, 2 feet 6 inches, of which 

 the tail alone measures 17 inches. 

 Hah. Western Africa. 



The specimen above described, I received several years since from Robert 

 MacDowell, M. D., surgeon, attached to the colonial government of Sierra 

 Leone, and an enthusiastic naturalist, who obtained it on the banks of the St. 

 Paul's river. 



This species resembles no other which I have seen, or of which I can find a 

 description, and may at once be recognized by its white erect crest and long 

 taU. 



For the same gentleman I have received several other specimens of this 

 genus, also from Western Africa, one of which is the Buceros elatus, Temm., 

 of which a figure of the head and bill is given in PI. Col., 521, and another 

 may be the female of the same species ; as such, however, I do not feel war- 

 ranted in describing it at present, the bills of the two specimens differing more 

 materially than I have been accustomed to seeing in the same species. 



Two crania of the Buceros elatus are in the collection of Dr. Morton, one 

 of which is undoubtedly from Western Africa. As this species appears to be 

 known only from the figure of the cranium and beak above alluded to, I take 

 the liberty of giving a description of the specimen which I suppose to be the 

 male.

 extends to the upper part of the breast.

Greater wing coverts with rounded white spots at their tips, forming a 

 conspicuous bar on the wing.

 attenuation edged (externally) with white. 



Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail 7^ inches, wing 8.8-10, 

 tail 3.4-10 inches. 



Hah. Mexico, near Vera Cruz. 



This species resembles no other which I have met with, and may readily 

 be recognized by its conspicuous and peculiar white bar on the wing, formed 

 by large white spots at the tips of the greater coverts. Upon examination 

 it will be found that these spots are on the outer webs only. 



I have seen one specimen only of this species, which belonged to the 

 Rivoli collection.

No white on the wings or on any other part of the body. 

 In a specimen which is probably that of a young bird, the black of the 

 chin is mixed with yellow ; no white whatever on any part of the plumage. 

 Total length from tip of bill to end of tail, about 7 inches, wing 3.6-10, 

 tail 3| inches. 

 Hab. Mexico and South America. 



Resembles Icterus cucullatus, Swainson, more than any other species 

 known to me, but I. cucullatus is very conspicuously marked with white on 

 the wings, which is not the case in the species now described. 



The I. cucullatus has black shoulders, its bill also is longer and more 

 slender, and in other respects it is entirely diflFerent. 



After a careful examination, with the advantage of the Academy's large 

 collection of Icteri, I am rather surprised that I can find no description 

 which will apply to this species, although I have seen it occasionally in col- 

 lections for the last ten years. 



Of the four specimens now in the collection of the Academy, two from the 

 Rivoli collection are labelled Mexico, one also from that collection is with- 

 out label of any kind, and the fourth was received by me from Brazil. I 

 have also seen specimens said to be from the island of Trinidad.

 wing 4.1-10, tail 4 inches. 



Hab. Bogota in New Grenada. 



Resembles Icterus xanthornus, (Linn.,) more than any other species with 

 which I ara acqiiiinted or have found described, but is larger, and has ihc 

 mask much broader. 



In I. xanthornus, the gular black scarcely exceeds the width of the under 

 mandible, but in the species now described, it fully includes the eyes and 

 the whole base of the bill. I. xanthornus has also white markings on the 

 wings, which is not the case in any stage of plumage represented by the IJTe 

 specimens now described. 



I have named this beautiful species in honor of Jacob P. Girard, Jr., Esq., 

 of the city of New York, author of "The Birds of Long Island," and other 

 important contributions to American Ornithology. 



The following Reports were then read, and ordered to be 

 published : 



REPORT 



or THE RECORDING SKCRKTAKT 



I For the years 1846 and 1647. 



It has now been two years since the last annual Report of the Record- 

 ing Secretary was laid before the Academy. This paper will therefore 

 include a brief statement of the Transactions of the Society for the two year? 

 past. 



During the year 1846, twenty-six Correspondents and five Members were 

 elected. Twenty communications, written by the following named gentle- 

 men, have been published in the Proceedings, viz. : One paper by Mr. T. A. 

 Conrad, entitled, " Descriptions of new species of Fossil and recent Shells 

 and Corals ;" one by Mr. Locke, " On an Asterias from the Blue Limestone 

 of Cincinnati;" one by Mr. Edward Harris, " On the difference of level be- 

 tween the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and those of the Atlantic Ocean.'' 

 one by Robert W. Gibbes, M. D., of Columbia, S. C, " On the Foesi; 

 Squalidae of the United States ;" one by Mr. William Gambel, being " Re-

 species," and " On several new genera and species of Insects ;" one by 

 Richard Owen, F. R. S., &c., being " Observations on certain Fossils from 

 the Academy of Natural Science."?, of Philadelphia; and one by Mr. John 

 Cassin, viz., "Note on an instinct probably possessed by the Herons. 

 (Ardea, Linn.)" 



The following amendments to the By-Laws have been made during the 

 same year, (1846) viz : 



Chap. V. Art. VL to commence thus : " The duty of the Librarian shall 

 be to attend daily at the Hall, from 11 o'clock, A. M. to 2h P. M., &c. ;'' 

 and to add to the same chapter, 



" Art. VIII. The chairman of the Curators shall attend daily at the Hall 

 from 2J o'clock, P. M., until sunset, to perform the duties of his office." 



From the commencement of the present year (1847) to the present time, 

 there have been elected thirteen Correspondents and nineteen Members. 



In the first five numbers of this year's " Proceedings" have been published 

 thirteen valuable original written communications, as follows : one by Prof. 

 S. S. Haldeman, being " Descriptions of several new species and one new 

 genus of Insects ;" one by Mr. M. Tuomey, State Geologist of South Caro- 

 lina, being a " Notice of the discovery of a cranium of the Zeuglodon ;"

 Academy, liave also been published in tlie Proceedings. 



The following alterations in the By-Laws have been made, viz. 



Art. VII. of Chap. VII. to read as follows : " Members may borrow books, 

 the property of the Academy, from the Librarian, on signing a promissory 

 note for fifty dollars, which shall become void on the book being returned." 



Art. Vin. of same Chapter : " But no works shall be loaned from the 

 Hall on any account whatever, except those marked with an asterisk (thus*) 

 in the catalogue, unless by an affirmative ballot vote of three fourths of the 

 members present when the application is made ; and in case of deposited 

 books, the written consent of the depositor having been previously obtained, 

 the name of the borrower and the title of the book to be recorded on the 

 Minutes, and security given for its safe return, by note or otherwise, for the 

 full value thereof, according to the estimate of the Librarian or Library 

 Committee." 



Since the last Annual Report, the affairs of the Academy have been in an 

 exceedingly flourishing condition. An addition of thirty feet has been made 

 to the building, and the sessions of the Academy are held in the Library, a 

 comfortable apartment in the basement of this addition — a great improve- 

 ment over the immense room in which its meetings were formerly held. 

 During the past year, the lecture room has been altered and adapted to tbt 

 purposes of the Museum — an alteration greatly needed in consequence of 

 the immense increase in the different departments through the munificent 

 donations and deposits lately received by this Institution. A report on 

 the state of these departments belongs more properly to other officers of the 

 Society ; it vvill therefore be sufhcient here simply to state, that during the 

 period embraced by this report, a greater impetus has been given to the 

 Academy than it has received at any previous period of its existence. Du- 

 ring the last two years, thanks to the noble liberality of a generous member, 

 and to the exertions of others, it has made such rapid strides that, in the 

 language of one of our Vice Presidents, " an hundred years of ordinary 

 prosperity could not have realized so much." It has completely thrown all 

 lethargy aside ; and, fully aroused and energetic, is now performing its full 

 quota towards the cause of scientific discovery and research. 

 All of which is respectfully submitted by

REPORT 



OF THE LIBRARIAN 



For 1347. 



The Librarian is enabled on the present occasion to exhibit to the Society 

 a highly flattering statement of the existing condition of the Library, and to 

 congratulate the merabers on its rapid increase and the great additional valne 

 which it has acquired during the year, and the peculiarly auspicious circum- 

 stances under which it has been placed since the last Annual Meeting. 



At that time, the Library occupied ranges of cases on either side of the large 

 Saloon or Hall in common with the collections of the Society. These accom- 

 modations were imperfectly adapted, either for a proper display of the Books, 

 or for such an arrangement of them as would afford easy and convenient re- 

 ference. Many of the cases were likewise greatly crowded, their contents in 

 consequence abused and injured, and in several instances it was necessary to 

 distribute works belonging to a particular department into cases at a consider- 

 able distance from each other. In addition, the want of proper daily ventila- 

 tion of the Hall in the summer season, and of regular warmth during the win- 

 ter, and the unavoidable exclusion of the members from the Library on those 

 days when the Hall was open to the public, were all serious obstacles to the 

 prosecution of study, on the very spot where, on the contrary, every facility 

 and advantage should be afforded. For the latter reasons especially, the 

 necessity of a separation of the Library from the Museum had been long felt 

 and acknowledged. Happily, through the spontaneous liberality of an indi- 

 vidual member, too favorably known among us to require to be named, the 

 Society has been enabled to remove all these objections and disadvantages, 

 and I have the pleasure this evening to present this report in a new apart- 

 ment, expressly designed for the purpose of a Library and Meeting room, and 

 possessing every convenience that could be desired. 



The removal of the books from the Hall to this room was commenced in 

 the latter part of April, and their arrangement in the cases was completed 

 about the close of the following month. In the arrangement, the principal 

 object has been to facilitate access to those works likely to be in most re- 

 quest, and accordingly the different departments of Natural History occupy 

 cases on the floor of the Library, commencing with general Natural History, 

 and followed by Botany, Conchology, Geology, Ornithology, &c. The remain- 

 ing cases on the floor contain Anatomy and Physiology, the Journals, and the 

 large and valuable collection of works on Antiquities and the Fine Arts. On 

 the gallery, are the various Dictionaries of Arts and Sciences and Encyclo- 

 paedias, Physical Science and Chemistry, History, Voyages and Travels, 

 Biography, &c. 



By a late regulation of the Society, the Librarian is required to be in at- 

 tendance at the Library daily during a part of the forenoon, and in the after- 

 noon his place is supplied by the Chairman of the Curators. 



From these measures the happiest effects have already resulted, and have 

 fully equalled expectation. Beside the greater protection necessarily alTor^ed 

 to the Library by a constant and daily supervision of it, they have tended, per- 




338 



[Dec. 1847. 



hap3 more than %ny others since the origin of the Institution, to proiluce a 

 better knowledge, and more correct appreciation of the truly legitimate ob- 

 jects of the latter, to invite and encourage study and research, and, not the 

 least of all, to bring together, and to create more frequent intercourse be- 

 tween, the members of the Society. 



The niimbcr of additions of all descriptions to the Library in the various 

 departments, during the presentyear, is exhibited in the following table : —

Making a total of 1072 additions of all descriptions to the Library in 1847. 



Of the whole number, there were presented by authors 54 ; by editors 31 ; 

 by members, correspondents and others 119; by Societies 56 ; obtained by 

 purchase or exchange 25 ; deposited by Dr. Thomas B. Wilson 586 ; by Dr. 

 R. E. Griffith 1G3 ; and by J. Price Wetherill, Esq., 9C. Two charts were 

 derived from the U. S. Treasury Department ; one from Mr. R. C. Taylor, and 

 one from Dr. Wilson. 



The above statements show a greater increase in the Library during the 

 last twelve months, than has occurred at any period since that in which it re- 

 ceived the noble contributions of its early benefactor William Maclure. It 

 will be seen also how very large a proportion of the whole number of additions 

 has been derived from our fellow member Dr. Wilson. From a reluctance to 

 occupy the time of the Society too long with this report,! refrain from a reca- 

 pitulation of the titles of the numerous splendid works deposited by this gentle- 

 man, and mustcontent myself therefore with referring those, who may be de- 

 sirous of forming some estimate of their great value, both in actual cost, and as 

 works of Science, to the printed Proceedings, in which they have been already 

 fully announced. Nearly all of them have been imported from abroad expressly 




Dec. 1847.] 339 



for this Library, and have been placed here by him with the sole object and 

 desire to foster and encourage a spirit of investigation, especially in the de- 

 partments of Ornithology, Geology and Conchology. 



In these acts the depositor has evinced an amount of disinterested gene- 

 rosity, and of zeal for the promotion of science, rarely to be found combined 

 in the same individual, and which have secured for him the lasting esteem 

 and gratitude of all connected with the Institution. 



To Dr. Griffith, the Society owes its highest acknowledgements for the 

 deposit of a large number of works in the various branches of Science, many 

 of them very rare and old, and probably contained in few public or private 

 Libraries in this country. 



Through Mr. Wetherill, the Library has been enriched the present year, 

 with severai important and valuable Geological works, and it is also in- 

 debted to him for completing its series of others, parts only of which it 

 previously possessed. 



In closing this report, an opportunity is afforded me of stating to the Society 

 that, during the ensuing year, the Library Committee, in conjunction with 

 the Librarian, propose to select from the numerous miscellaneous works in 

 the collection, such of them as may appear either extraneous to the objects of 

 the Society, or of little value or utility in any form to the members, and to 

 exchange these for other works, either on subjects of Natural History, or of 

 an otherwise really useful character, and also to allow room for further 

 additions of the latter description. 



A list of those proposed to be rejected will, however, be first submitted to 

 the Society, and its consent fully obtained, before any action will be taken 

 by the Committee. 



Wm. S. Zantzinger, 

 December 28/A, 1847. Librarian. 



REPORT 



OF THE CURATORS 



for the year 1847. 



At no time since the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia was 

 instituted, has its condition been more prosperous than at present; and 

 indeed, it is such as to form an important epoch in the progress of Natural 

 Science in America. This successful state is mainly attributable to the 

 interest which ouc fellow-member and co-labourer, Dr. Thomas B. Wilson, 

 has latterly taken in it. In 1846, this gentleman, through his brother, Mr. 

 Edward Wilson, of Lydstep House, South Wales, a Correspondent of the 

 Academy, purchased, in Paris, the large and magnificent collection in orni- 

 thology of the Due de Rivoli, which, upon importing to this country, he 

 resolved to deposit in the Academy, and at his private expense increased 

 the building to an extent commensurate with the end in view — the accom- 

 modation of this vast addition to the Musuem. More space was also 




340 [Dec. 1847 



obtained in the museum, by removing the library, which had occupied several 

 ranges of cases, into the basement room of the new part of the building. 



In May, 1847, Dr. Wilson made a second large purchase in Ornithology, 

 in England, of Mr. A. Gould's splendid collection of Australian birds, 

 which renders a further increase of space necessary for its accommo- 

 dation. For this purpose, Dr. Wilson obtained ready permission of the 

 Academy to convert its little used lecture room into part of the museumi 

 which work is rapidly progressing towards completion. The north east 

 basement room is also undergoing change for the same object. In accordance 

 with the original plan of the building, all the additions and improvements 

 to it have been made fire-proof. When completed, the collections of the 

 Academy will be contained in three rooms, as follow : 



The first or upper room, or hall, is one hundred and ten feet in length, 

 by forty-two in breadth, and is lighted from above, and from the eagt 

 and west extremities. On the north and south sides are three galleries, 

 and four ranges of vertical cases, and a range of foot cases at the outer 

 edge of the second gallery. On the west side are three galleries and four 

 ranges of vertical cases, on the east side two galleries and two ranges of 

 vertical cases. The two lower ranges of cases on the south side, for two- 

 thirds the length of the room, corresponding to the old part, are occupied by 

 Dr. S. G. Morton's extensive series of human and other crania, and the col- 

 lection in Comparative Anatomy. The lowest range of cases on the north 

 side, for the same extent as those just mentioned, contains the collection of 

 Mammalia ; and the range above this, Dr. Dickeson's collection of Ameri- 

 can antiquities and the Carpological cabinet, and leads into the herba- 

 rium room in the north east corner. All the remaining ranges of cases 

 mentioned contain the Ornithological collection. The floor of the hall is to 

 be occupied by ranges of horizontal, centrally vertical, double cases for the 

 reception of the collection in Palaeontology. One of these ranges has been 

 already finished, and part of the collection arranged in it ; the others are in 

 progress of construction. At the east extremity, on each side, is a strong 

 vertical case, containing the skeletons of large fossil Sauri in massive slabs 

 of lias limestone. 



The second or east basement room is forty-one feet in length by forty in 

 l)readth, with a gallery all around it and communicating with another 

 running through its centre. This room will be appropriated to the Minera- 

 logical, Conchological, Herpetological, and Ichthyological collections. 



The third, or north east basement room is sixteen feet by nine feet, has a 

 gallery on three of its sides, and is to accommodate the collections of 

 Crustacea and Entomology. 



The state of the different departments of the museum, as they at present 

 exist, with the additions which have been made during the past year, will 

 now be briefly referred to. 



Mammalogy. — The expensive character of the larger objects in this branch 

 of Zoology, as well as the amount of space required for their proper accom- 

 modation, have prevented the Academy from accumulating any great 

 number of them. We possess most of the North American species, besides 




Dec. 1847.] 341 



a few foreign ones. During the past year a comparatively large number 

 has been received, and it is to be hoped that efforts will be made towards a 

 further increase. We enumerate for 1847, eighty mounted specimens and 

 five skins of iMammalia, chiefly of foreign species, presented by Dr. Wilson, 

 and six specimens presented by Dr. Thomas S. Savage, Mr. Germain, &c. 



Ornithology. — Of this department, in which at this time we stand equal 

 to any in the world, a special report is hereto appended, prepared by Mr. 

 John Cassin, who, with Mr. \Vm. Gambel, has particularly attended to its 

 arrangement. 



In Oology, belonging to the department of Ornithology, in the past year 

 we received in donations, eggs of 79 species of birds, principally from Dr. 

 Wilson and Mr. William H. Edwards. 



Herpetology — Our collection ot Reptilia is a large and valuable one. A 

 part of it, however, is not in the best state of preservation, but will be early 

 attended to in the coming year, and before any loss of consequence is sus- 

 tained. During the past year 88 species of Reptilia have been presented, 

 chiefly by Drs. Hallowell, Savage, Wilson, and Hildreth. 



Ichthyology . — In this department we have not made much advance. It is 

 to be hoped the Academy will hereafter encourage this branch more than it 

 has done. During the past year. Dr. Thomas S, Savage presented several 

 jars of fishes from Western Africa, many of which are probably new, and 

 we are indebted to several members for a large specimen of the rare Squatina 

 Dumerili. 



Molhisca. — The arrangement of the conchological cabinet has been kindly 

 undertaken by Dr. R. E. Griffith, who with the greatest liberality is also in- 

 corporating with it his own private collection, which, as he progresses, he 

 presents to the Academy. In this step he has been followed by the ever 

 liberal Wilson, so that when the collection is fully arranged, with the addi- 

 tion of the two private cabinets, it will contain between 9 and 10,000 spe- 

 cies, many of them of the most valuable character. 



During the past year there have been presented 1209 species of shells by 

 Dr. R. E. Griffith; 3S3 species by Dr. T. B. Wilson; 200 species by Wm. 

 Thompson, Esquire, of Ireland ; 40 species by Mr. C. B. Adams ; 31 species 

 by Mr. T. A. Conrad; and 30 species by several others, inall 1893 species, 

 and almost 2300 varieties. 



Entomology , — The destruction of the Academy's once fine collection of 

 Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, for a while quite discouraged those members 

 who were particularly interested in this department, but the general stimulus 

 which has been infused into the Academy by the rich contributions to other 

 departments, has aroused them once more to exertion in the formation of a 

 new collection, which already bids fair to surpass the one lost. Our fellow 

 member, Mr. R. Kilvington, during the past year, made a liberal dona- 

 tion of 1035 specimens, comprising 345 species of British Lepidoptera. and 

 Dr. T. S. Savage has recently presented a collection in alcohol, of large and 




342 [Dec. 1847. 



ma'»nificent Coleoptera from Western Africa, many of which are new spe- 

 cies. 



Crustacea. — Our collection of Crustacea, numbers 1G2 species, and was 

 carefully arranged during the past summer by Dr. Lewis R. Gibbes, of 

 South Carolina, and catalogued by Dr. R. Bridges. Twelve species have 

 been presented the past year by several of the members. 



Zoophytes. — Eighty-nine specimens of fifty-nine species of corallines and 

 sponges, and three species of Echinodermala have been presented in the 

 course of the last year. 



Comparative Analomij. — Additions still continue to be made tc Dr. S. 

 G. Morton's large and magnificent series of human crania, which now con- 

 tains upwards of seven hundred specimens of many nations and of various 

 epochs. • 



At present there appears to be a strong disposition amongst the members 

 to attend more particularly to the heretofore rather neglected department of 

 Comparatve Anatomy. During the past year 385 crania, comprising 260 

 species of animals, have been presented, principally by Drs. Wilson, Morton, 

 and HufTnagle. Among the number may be particularly mentioned the 

 very large and perfect specimens of crania of Crocodilus vulgaris and 

 Gavialis gavgeticus. Eight mounted skeletons have also been presented, 

 among wh'ch are a fine and large skeleton of Felis tigris from Dr. Huffnagle, 

 and a beautiful skeleton 12 feet long oi Boa Constrictor from several of the 

 members. 



Botany. — The botanical collection comprises upwards of 40,000 species 

 of dried plants, and about 1000 species of dried fruits. It has been kept in 

 a good state of preservation up to the present time, but has lately been 

 slightly injured by insects; the further ravages of which, will however, be 

 prevented. 



Palaontology . — The collection of organic remains which occupied the 

 range of cases on the upper gallery of the south side of the ball, has been 

 removed to the cases prepared for its reception on the floor of the hall, and 

 is in progress of arrangement by Dr. Wilson. It has received very exten- 

 sive and invaluable accessions during the past year, and when completely 

 arranged will contain in the neighbourhood of 20,000 specimens. In it are 

 the valuable collections of Mr. R. C. Taylor, J. Price Wetherill, Esq., Dr. 

 Morton, Mr. T. A. Conrad, Dr. Dickeson, Miss Benett, &c. The last year 

 Dr. Wilson deposited in the Academy five very nearly perfect skeletons of 

 large fossil Saurians. One of these is the Plesiosaurus Hawkinsii, three are 

 species of Ichthyosauri, and the fifth is the Telosaurus, or Gavial de Boll of 

 Cuvier. 



Mr. Conrad presented 2000 specimens from the Miocene of France, the 

 Eocene, Cretaceous, Oolitic, mountain limestone, and Salurian formations of 

 England and France. Mr. R. C. Taylor has presented an extensive collec- 

 tion of very large and beautiful specimens of coal plants of Pennsylvania, be- 

 sides numerous other fossils, which have not yet been examined. Numerous 




Dec. 1847.] 343 



specimens of coal plants from Prof. W. E. Johnson, Green sand fossils of 

 Germany, from Dr. F. Roemer, Silurian fossils of New York from Mr. W. A. 

 Pease, and many others, have been received. Dr. Wilson has also deposited 

 about 10,000 fossils, which are already in progress of arrangement, and 

 which he intends presenting to the Academy so soon as a list can be made out. 



Mineralogy and Geology — The mineralogical collection is at present 

 carefully packed up in boxes, preparatory to its removal to the north-east 

 basement room, now undergoing alteration. We are indebted to the gene- 

 rosity of Mr. R. 0. Taylor for a donation during the iast year, of a large col- 

 lection of rocks, comprising several thousand varieties from different parts of 

 North America and the West India Islands. 



Forty specimens of minerals, some of them very beautiful, have been pre- 

 sented by members and others during the past year. 



In the course of the arrangement of the mineralogical collection, which 

 several gentlemen have kindly consented to undertake, we have good reason 

 to believe that large additions will be made from the private cabinet? of 

 members interested in this department. 



Physics. — The last year Mr. Henry Seybert deposited in the Academy a 

 valuable chemical apparatus for the use of the members, which we hope ere 

 long may prove of essential service to the Institution. 



The great increase and importance of the museum and library of the Aca- 

 demy, have rendered it necessary that both should be under regular daily 

 supervision. The Academy, therefore, has made it the duty of the chairman 

 of the Curators and Librarian to be present alternately during certain hours 

 daily for this purpose. 



We conclude this report by stating that the greatest good feeling and har- 

 mony prevails among the members of the Society, all of whom desire to 

 promote the interests of this noble Institution and the cause of science in 

 general. 



Joseph Leidy, 

 December 2%th, 1847. Chairman of Curators. 



SPECIAL KEPORT 



ORNITHOLOGICAL DEPARTMENT. 



The operations in the Ornithological department of the Academy have been 

 of so highly important, not to say of so extraordinary a character, during the 

 year now about closing, that the undersigned Curator, who has been exclu- 

 sively engaged in that department, hopes he may be allowed to submit a 

 special report, in compliance with a request made by the chairman of the 

 Curators. 



I have the high gratification of reporting, that through the ardent attach- 

 ment to the study of the Natural Sciences, and the great personal enterprize 

 also, of a member of this Society, a collection has been organized, which, as 




344 [Dkc. 1847. 



it now stands, is one of tho, first extant, and wlicn further additions already 

 engaged shall have arrived, the Ornithological collection of this Academy 

 will be probably the most extensive and complete in the world. 



The collection, well known in Europe as that of the Prince Massena, Duke 

 of Rivoli, has been received. This large collection, the arrangement of 

 which is now nearly completed, consists of not less than twelve thousand 

 five hundred specimens, from all parts of the world, and in a very superior 

 state of preservation. 



Where so many of the families and genera of birds are alike fully repre- 

 sented, it is not easy to pronounce in which of these a collection is most 

 remarkable ; this distinction, however, in the Rivoli collection, I am in- 

 clined to award to the Rapacious birds, in the various genera of which it is 

 not only almost absolutely complete, but very many of the species are illus- 

 trated by series of specimens showing varieties of plumage, or distinctions 

 of sex, age and season, in the most satisfactory manner. Of the Aquila 

 chrysaetos, (Linn.) or Golden Eagle, for instance, there are six specimens : 

 of the Aquila Bonellii, (Bonap ) also six; of the Aquila najvia, (Gm.) five; 

 of the Aquila vulturina. (Daud.) a large black Eagle from South Africa, four 

 specimens; of the Haliaetus vocifer, (Daud.) six ; of the Helotarsus ecauda- 

 tus, (Daud.) six ; of thePernisapivorus. (Linn.) ten; of theButeounicinctue, 

 (Temm.) nine; of the Buteo aguia, (Temm.) nine specimens; and many of 

 the smaller or more variable species are even more fully represented. Of the 

 Astur magnirostris, (Gm.) for instance, we have fifteen specimens, of the 

 Accipiter nisus, (Linn.) thirteen, of the Meliecrax musicus, (Daud. twelve, 

 of the Circus cinerascens, (Mont.) fifteen, of the Falco peregriuus, Gm., 

 fourteen, and of one species, the Falco sparverius, Linn., twenty-six speci- 

 mens were not considered too many to illustrate its supposed changes and 

 varieties ; and even with these the Duke or his Curator appears to have been 

 scarcely satisfied, for among the specimens in the collection, marked as un- 

 determined, were six others of this species. I mention this case, more par- 

 ticularly, because it affords an example of the extraordinary care and atten- 

 tion shown by the former proprietor of this collection ; not even a variety, of 

 any possible consequence in the representation of a species, having been 

 neglected, when attainable, notwithstanding the previous existence in the 

 collection of numerous specimens of the same species. 



Of Vultures, all the known species, except three, are in the Rivoli col- 

 lection; one of which, I may observe, has been obtained from another 

 source. 



Taking into consideration the comparative difficulty of collecting Rapa- 

 cious birds, and more especially of forming such series of specimens as are 

 to be found in this collection, its great scientific value in the Order Rap- 

 tores ; is sufficiently evident. 



Nor are other Orders far behind the Raptores, and it is rather a remark- 

 able as well as interesting character, that in many genera the species of 

 which are of more difficult attainment, such as the larger swimmers, 

 waders and gallinaceous birds, the Rivoli collection is particularly complete. 



Of the Natatores, or swimming birds, the collection is scarcely second to 




Dec. 1847.] 345 



chat of the Rapacious birds. I beg leave to refer to the splendid collections 

 of the species constituting the various genera of geese, ducks, cormorants 

 and gulls, now beautifully arranged by Mr. Gambel, for the truth of my 

 assertion. The genera Diomedea, Porcellaria and Thalassidroma, are also 

 very amply illustrated. The specimens of the several species of Pelicans, 

 are highly interesting, as are also those of Alca impennis, Linn., Phaleris 

 cristatella, Gm., Mormon glacialis, Linn., and others of species vrhich like 

 these, only inhabit the Arctic regions. 



The magnificent series of specimens of the Flam'jgos, also will be found 

 especially worthy of notice. 



The order Grallatores, or wading birds, is very extensively represented ; 

 the various genera of plovers, herons, storks, ibises, — in fact, scarcely a genus 

 can be named which is not fully illustrated. The genus Grus, or cranes, is 

 especially worthy of attention. I may notice, too, the various species of 

 Ibis, particulaly the Ibis religiosa, Guv., or sacred Ibis of the Ancient 

 Egyptians, of which a suite of specimens will be found in its proper place. 



Of the Rasores or Gallinaceous birds, the Pigeons number one hundred and 

 twenty species. 



The genera Perdix, Phasianus, Pterocles, Tetrao and Otis are richly repre- 

 sented, as are also the beautiful genera Gallus, Lophopharus and Tragopan. 



I may be allowed to notice especially, splendid specimens of Pano muti- 

 i:ua, Linn. — of the Phasiani Scemmeringii, Temm., Stacei, Vigors, and 

 veaeratus, Temm., of Gallus Sonneratii, Temm., of Gallus Lafayettii, Less., 

 of the Polyplectron emphanum, Temm., very fine specimens of the Argus 

 giganteus, Temm., and also a specimen of that singular bird, the Apteryx 

 australis, Shaw, of which, at quite a recent period, but one specimen was 

 known in Europe. 



In the great order Incessores or Perching birds, the Garrulinse, Icterinae, 

 Tanagrinae, Laniinae, Turdinse, Caprimulginre, and theScansoria! subfamilies 

 generally deserve particular notice. 



Of Paradise birds there are all the known species. 



Of the Hornbills, (Buceros,) six species only are wanting. 



Of the various genera of Parrots, there are upwards of two hundred 

 species. 



In short, so extensive and comprehensive is the Rivoli collection, that it 

 is evident an extraordinary attachment to natural history, a superior 

 knowledge of Ornithology, constant assiduity during a long period, and 

 opportunities of no common order, must alike have contributed to its for- 

 mation. 



Besides the Rivoli collection, others of great interest have been received, 

 one of the most important of which is that of M. Bourcier, an Ornithologist 

 of the city of Lyons, well known by his papers in the Annales des Sciences 

 Physiques et Naturelles de Lyons, the Revue Zoologique and other journals. 



The collection consists of ^about one thousand specimens, and is almost 

 exclusively composed of Conirostres, and Scansores ; a large portion of 




346 [Dec. 1847. 



which are South American and Mexican species. M. Boarcier's col- 

 lections contains specimens of nearly all the little known species of New 

 Grenada, and is especially rich in the beautiful Tanagers of that country. 



The collection made in California by Mr. Wm. Gambel, I am happy to 

 state, has also been added to the collection of this Society. This collection 

 contains numerous and remarkably beautiful specimens of the birds of 

 Western America, many of which were not previously in any collection in 

 the United States, and are of rare occurrence in those of Europe. 



The specimens of the hitherto unknown species described by this enter- 

 prising young naturalist, in the Proceedings and Journal of this Academy, 

 are especioliy interesting, as well as those of Tyrannulae Saya (B^nap.) and 

 nigricans, Sw., Ptilogonys Townsendii, Aud., Pica Nultallii, Aud., Pipilo 

 fuscus, Sw., Picus Harrisii, Aud., Picus scalaris, Wagler, Lanius elegans, 

 Sw., llitmatopus Bachmannii, Aud., Strepsilas melanocephalus, Vigors, and 

 many others. 



Mr. Edward Harris has presented to the Society several specimens of un- 

 usual value to the collection, of which may be mentioned a specimen of 

 Tyrannus veriicalis, (Say,) shot near his residence at Moorestown, N. J., 

 being the first instances of the appearance of this species so far west or 

 north. 



A series of specimens of the genus Parus, including the Parus septentrio- 

 nalis, Harris, has also been presented by this gentleman. 



A collection made by the writer during a period of about fifteen years 

 is also merged into that of the Academy. It is composed principally of 

 birds from Western Africa, collected under some advantages, and of the 

 rarer birds of North America. Of the African species, I may be allowed 

 to mention a series of specimens of Musophaga violacea, Isert, including 

 males, females and young birds ; — specimens of Taracus giganteus. Vieill. — 

 Buceros elatus, Temm. — Cuculus Klaasii, Le Vaill. — Pyrenestes ostrina, 

 Vieill. and others. 



Of the American species, those of most interest are a series of specimeny 

 of Archibuteo sanctijohannis, (Gm.) including the perfectly adult bird, and 

 the rare stage of plumage figured by Wilson as a variety ; also several spe- 

 cimens including the perfect adult of Buteo Pennsylvanicus, (Wilson,) or 

 broad winged Hawk; a specimen of Asiur atricapillus, Wilson, from New 

 Jersey; a series of nine specimens of Astur Cooperi, (Bonaparte;) also a 

 specimen of Bombycilla garrula, (Linn.) shot near this city ; several speci- 

 mens of Trichas Philadelphia, Wilson, Sylvicolaj maritima, (Wilson,) agillis. 

 (Wilson,) coerulea, (Wilson,) and many others of this genus. 



There will also be found several specimens of Rallus Jamaicensis, Briss. 

 obtained near this city ; a series of specimens of Anser hyperboreus, (Gm.; 

 also a specimen of Bernicla nigricans, (Lawrence,) a recently discovered 

 American species, of which this is the third specimen. 



Various collections, including several hundred specimens from the cele- 

 brated Ornithologist M. Temminck of Leyden, and a large number from the 




Dec. 1847.] 347 



Britidh Museum, have been secured for this Society through the exertions of 

 Mr. Edward Wilson, now residing in England. 



To this gentleman the collections of the Society are indebted in a de- 

 gree second only to that of his distinguished brother. 



Independently of his immediate agency in obtaining the Rivoli collection 

 and that of M. Bourcier, the collections made by him, personally, in various 

 cities of Europe, evince at once his love of Natural History, his excellent 

 judgment and his just appreciation of the wants of the natural sciences in 

 this his native country. 



Mr. Wilson's ornithological collections, in the aggregate, amount to 

 several thousand specimens, a portion of which, only, has been received ; — 

 but that portion contains some of our most valuable acquisitions. I will 

 mention a fine specimen of Haliaetus pelagicus, (Pall.) from Behring's 

 Straits, a species which is probably the largest of known FalconidsE, and is 

 especially interesting to American Ornithologists from the fact of its being 

 an inhabitant of the northern regions of this continent ; also a beautiful 

 specimen of the Meleagris ocellata, Temm., the second species of Turkey 

 discovered a few years since in Yucatan. 



For almost the whole of the large collection of Humming Birds the 

 Society is indebted to the same gentleman. 



One other collection, which is to be delivered to this Society early in the 

 coming year, remains to be noticed, and that is Mr. John Gould's collection 

 of the birds of Australia. 



When I inform the Society that this collection contains specimens of all 

 the known Australian birds, except five species, and of the nests and eggs 

 of a large number, its peculiar value will be immediately understood. I 

 may be excused for remarking, however, that Mr. Gould's collection acquires 

 additional interest from the consideration that it contains the original speci- 

 mens from which many of the numerous species described by him were first 

 characterized, and that the specimens comprised in his collection are those 

 from which the drawings were made for his latest and splendid work, " The 

 Birds of Australia." 



The number of specimens now contained in the collection and those 

 which will be received in the course of the ensuing year, according to ar- 

 rangements now completed, may be estimated as follows : 



Duke of Rivoli's collection, .... 12,500 specimens 



M. Bourcier's collection, 1,000 " 



Mr. Edward Wilson's collections . . . 4,000 " 



Mr. Gambel's and Mr. Cassin's collections . . 1,000 " 



Mr. Gould's collection, 2,000 " 



Former collections of the Academy . . . 2.500 " 



23,000 

 As premised at the commencement of this report, this magnificent result 

 is the work of an individual member of this Society, himself a naturalist of 

 excellent and varied acquirements, who in the formation of this and other 




348 [Dec. 1847. 



collections, and a library also, in natural history, may be said to bave real- 

 ized the happiest hopes of the American student and the American natural- 

 ist, and to have marked an era which mu3l ever be acknowledged as the 

 most important in the history of the Zoological sciences in this country. 



The arrangement of this immense collection, excluding duplicates, will, 

 in all proUiibility be completed during the coming year, and it is also pro- 

 bable that at the next annual meeting of the Academy, a report can be mad*" 

 of the exact number of species and specimens exhibited. 



It is to be understood, however, that other extensive additions are con- 

 templated, which if received and incorporated into the present collection, 

 may, of course, naturalUy affect the issue to which I allude. 



All of which is respectfully submitted by 



John CassiS; 



December 28th, 1847. Curator. 



A note was read from Prof. Haldeman, dated Columbia. 

 Penn., Dec. 27, 1847, requestii)g that the following correctioa 

 of his published papers may be noticed in the present No. 

 of tiie Proceedings. 



The genus IIeteuodromia, Hald., Proceedings Academy, vol. o. 

 p. 127, seems to be identical with PsAMMflECnus, Boudicr, although 

 the prothorax is not wider than long, as described by Latreille. 



The proposed genus Chorea, Raid., Proceedings Academy, 

 vol. 3, p. 150, is founded upon the female of Cerophytum, unless 

 the structure of the posterior femora should be found to differ. 

 Neither of these rare genera has been yet announced as Ameri- 

 can, and but one species of each is found in Europe. M. Lucas 

 has described a species of Psammocchus from Algeria, which be 

 names Boudieri. 



The Academy then proceeded to an election for Officers for
