Professor Johnson communicated some observations in 

 relation to the properties and habitudes of different varieties 

 of coal. 



1. He gave the results of some recent analysis of coal, which strongly con- 

 firm the position which he had previously advanced, viz.: that in coals from 

 â€¢he same coal district, and where that part of the mineral substance which is 

 combustible may be considered as similiarly constituted, ihe density of different 

 specimens may be considered as the index to their relative impurity. 




February, 1844. j 



From seven samples of coal from different mining districts were taken, at 

 random, specimens for analysis 



per cent. 

 From the first sample specimen C a had a sp. gr. 1 .43 8, and t;ave of ashes, 1 8.99

2. He also called attention to the fact that, from the same hand specimen, 

 may often be obtained widely different results by analysis. .^ small specimen 

 was shown, in which were displayed most decided differences of structure, 

 lustre, colour, character of powder, amount of volatile matter, amount and 

 character of impurities. This was a specimen of coal from the Cumberland 

 coal field of Maryland â€” in which a portion was columnar and crystalline 

 in form â€” of a deep jet black colour, shining and friable, giving a brown pow- 

 der, and when coked, yielding a highly intumescent porous mass, and leaving, 

 when completely incinerated, only 1 .754 per cent, of reddish yellow or fawn 

 coloured ashes, exceedingly light,and liable to be carried away by the slightest 

 motion of air. The same part yielded 18.28 percent, of volatile matter, and 

 consequently left 79.9G6 per cent of fixed carbon. The other part of the speci- 

 men was amorphous in structure, tough in consistence, dull, and almost des- 

 titute of lustre, yielding when completely pulverized, an almost black powder. 

 It gives, when incinerated, 14.736 per cent, of ashes, of a greenish white co- 

 lour, very dense, and cohering slightly when strongly heated. Its volatile 

 matter is 15.976 per cent and consequently the fixed carbon 69.288. The coke 

 produced swells more or less, according to the rapidity of the application of 

 heat. 



3. He adverted to the designations red and white ash coals, and exhibited 

 proofs that mere analysis, on a minute scale, is liable to mislead us in regard 

 to the true character of the earthy residua of the coals in question. He exhi- 

 bited a sampleof ashes and of clinker, from Lackawanna anthracite, obtained 

 from the combustion of two tons of that coal ; and also a specimen of ashes 

 from the analysis of a hand specimen, â€” the former being dark brownish 

 red, and the latter, almost perfectly white. 



4. He presented evidences of the effect of the rate of heating on the amount 

 and character of the coke produced from a given weight of coal of the same 

 kind, showing that when a brisk and intense action of heat is made the means 



9 




10 [Febkuaky, 1^44. 



of coking the coal, a consulerably greater amount of volatile matter is ex- 

 pelled than when a slow application of heat gradually drives off the matier 

 volatilizable by that principle alone. 



The Chairman amioiinced to the meeting the recent tie- 

 cease (on the 10th inst.) of Dr. INI. Burrough, late a member 

 of this Institution, and one of its most zealous and activ^e 

 friends, and a large contributor to its collections in all the de- 

 partments of Natural Science. 



Whereupon the following Resolutions presented by Pro- 

 fessor Johnson, were unanimously adopted : 



Resolved, That the members of this Academy have hear 

 with unfeigned regret of the decease of cur late valued and 

 highly respected member, Dr. Marmaduke Burrough, whose 

 zeal in the cause of Natural Science, persevering industry in 

 the prosecution of jits various departments, and deep interest 

 in the welfare of this Institution, have laid it under numerous 

 and lasting obligation to our deceased associate. 



Resolved, That the members of this Academy deplore the 

 loss of Dr. Burrough, not only as the ardent prosecutor of 

 scientific researches, but as the undeviating man of honor, 

 and highly accomplished gentleman. 



Resolved, That the Vice President of this Society, Dr. 

 S. G. Morton, be requested to communicate to the family of 

 the deceased a copy of the foregoing Resolutions.

A paper, by Dr. Morton, describing a supposed new spe-

 rad, Dr. Goddard, and Prof. Johnson. 



A letter was read from Mr. Isaac G. Strain, of the U. S. 

 Navy,* Corresponding Member of the Academy, addressed 

 to Dr. Morton as Vice President, giving the synopsis of the 

 translation, by himself, of a letter from Dr. Lund, of the 

 Royal Society of Antiquarians at Copenhagen, to the Histo- 

 rical and Geographical Society of Brazil, on the subject of 

 some organic remains recently discovered in the calcareous 

 rocks in the Province of Minas Geraes, Brazil. 



[The interesting and novel information contained in Dr. 

 Lund's letter has induced the Committee on Proceedings to 

 submit for publication the entire translation of Mr. Strain,] 



Rio de Janeiro, 7th December, 1S43. 



My Dear S'r. â€” Knowing the interest yon, as well as the other members 

 of the Academy, take in any subject tending to throw light upon the history 

 of the human race, I take the liberty of giving you a synopsis of a translation 

 I have made of a letter addressed by Dr. Lund, of the Royal Society of Anti- 

 quarians at Copenhagen, to the Historical and Geographical Society of Bra- 

 zil, of which he is an honorary member. 



Dr. Lund has for some time been pursuing his investigations in the Province 

 of Minas Geraes; and has devoted his attention particularly to the fossil 

 remains found in the calcareous rocks of that region. At present he is engaged 

 in the publication of a work entitled, Blik paa Braziliens Dyreverden, or a 

 View of the animal creation which inhabited Brazil immediately preceding 

 the present state of things. The Doctor states it to have been his wish to have 



* Mr Strain left the United States in the summer of last j'ear in a Govern- 

 ment vessel for South America, as the head of a scientific exploring party 

 into a portion of the interior of that country, and which promises important 

 and interesting results. Mr. S. goes out under the auspices of the U. S. 

 Government, aided also by members of this Institution and other indivi- 

 duals, and is amply furnished with every requisite for the successful prose- 

 cution of his hazardous and arduous undertaking. Since his arrival at Rio, 

 he has also been fortunate enough lo obtain every facility and encourage- 

 ment froni the Imperial Government. The letter above was written on 

 the ove of his departure on his journey. 




12 [February, 1S44. 



published in French ; but not being ready, he immediately communicated with 

 the Geographical Institute, with the remark, however, that being written in a 

 language little known, he expects to ensure but few readers. He commences 

 by referring to the question of the coexistence of man with the extinct Ter- 

 restrial mammiferous animals, as a point which the Naturalists of the old 

 world have not been able to resolve decisively: that some few facts appear 

 favourable to an affiimative, but more to a negative solution ; that, though he 

 has had an opportunity to submit the question to a new examination in this 

 part of the world, he has not had pioofs to arrive at a definite result, although 

 his labors in Zoology have terminated most happily. The geological archives 

 of the history of our planet are found (says the learned Doctor) in the caverns 

 of the calcareous rocks, which enter, as a constituent part, into the most 

 extensive formations in the interior of Brazil. The animals whose remains 

 he has met, are for the most part different from those which actually exist on 

 the surface, showing that they belong to a distinct creation. 



He has already examined nearly two hundred caverns. The species of ani- 

 mals he has examined, of the mammiferous class alone, number one hundred 

 and fifteen, which much exceeds the number now existing of this class, which 

 he has reduced to eighty-eight. 



From the mutilated state in which they were generally found, it appears 

 probable that they owe their introduction to the beasts of prey of those 

 times â€” the denizens of those caverns â€” who carried them there to devour 

 them. In the midst of these testimonials of an order of things differing from 

 the actual, he had not the slightest vestige of the existence of man; and if 

 man had existed, how could he have escaped the fate of animals stronger 

 than he, who w-ere victims of these ferocious and gigantic beasts of prey. 

 This evidence he thought suflSclent to decide the question negatively, when 

 he unexpectedly met the first remains of the human species under circum- 

 stances which, at least, admit of a contrary solution. He found these remains 

 in a cavern which contained mixed with them bones of animals decidedly 

 extinct; (Platyonix Bucklandii, Chlamydotherium Humboltii, C. majus, 

 Dasypus sulcatus, Hydrochaerus sulcidens, &c.) a circumstance which ought 

 to call attention to these interesting relics. Besides, they present all the cha- 

 racters of really fossil bones. They were in part petrified, and in part pene- 

 trated with iron particles, which gave to them a metallic lustre, resembling 

 bronze, and at the same time an extraordinary weight. Of the immense age 

 of these remains there can be no doubt ; but, upon the question of the coexist- 

 ence with animals whose remains were found with them, we cannot, unfor- 

 tunately, arrive at a definite conclusion, as the cave is situated on the margin 

 of a lake whose waters i ise annually, and in the rainy season enter it ; so it is 

 possilde the remains of animals, now existing, might have been more recently 

 introduced, and mixed with those already deposited These bones are in dif- 

 ferent states of preservation ; some differing little from new bones, while others 

 approximateto the sub-metallic state already referred to; but the greaternum- 

 ber occupy a grade of decomposition intermediate between the two extremes. 

 A similar difference, but less conceivable, he noted among the human bones, 




February, IS 14.] 13 



proving a diversity of ages, while all showed an antiquity; making them 

 most interesting, even if they do not solve the question of coexistence. In 

 Kiirope, (sajs the Doctor,] the remains of the great species of terrestrial 

 mammiferous animals are 'he only proof of their existence; as no mention 

 is made of them in history; consequently their extinction dates back more 

 than three thousand years. Applying the san e result to the extinct species 

 of Brazil, with which they agree in their state, and attributing to the human 

 bones found in a state perfectly analogous to those which characterise these 

 fossils, we take for them an age of thirty centuries and upward. Ailmitting, 

 then, the proofs of these document^, the population of Brazil is derived from 

 very remote times, and undoubtedly anterior to the time of history. 



The question then arises, who were these people? what their mode of life? 

 of what race ? and what their intellectual perfection ? The answers to these 

 questions are, happily, less difficult and doubtful. He examined various crania, 

 more or less perfect, in order to determine the place they ought to occupy in 

 the system of Anthropology. The narrowness of the forehead, the prominence 

 of the zygomatic bones, the facial angle, the niaxillnry and orbital con'orraa- 

 tion, all assign to these crania a place among the characteristics of the Ame- 

 rican race. .\nd it is known, says the Doctor, in continuation, that the race 

 which approximates nearest to this is the Mongolian ; and the most distinctive 

 and salient characte.'- by which we distinguish between them, is by the greater 

 depression of the forehead of the former. In this point of organization, these 

 ancient crania show not only the peculiarity of the American race, but this 

 peculiarity, in many instances, in an excessive degree ; even to the entire dis- 

 appearance of the forehead. We must allow, then, that the people who occupied 

 this country in those remote times, were of the same race as those who inha- 

 bited it at the time of the conquest. We know that the human figures found 

 sculptured in the ancient monuments of Mexico represent, for the greater part, 

 a singular conformation of head, â€” being entirely w.ithout forehead, â€” the cra- 

 nium retreating backward immediately above the su|)erciliary arch. This ano- 

 maly, which is generally attributed to an artificial disfiguration of the head, or 

 the taste of the artist, now admits a more natural explanation ; it being now 

 proved, by these authentic documents, that there really existed on this continent 

 a race exhibiting this anomalous conformation. The skeletons, which were of 

 both sexes, were of the ordinary height, although two of the men were above 

 the common stature. These heads, according to the received opinions in Cra- 

 niology, could not have occupied a high position in intellectual standing. This 

 opinion is corroborated by finding an instrument of imperfect construction 

 joined wil h the skeletons. This instrument is simply a smooth stone, of a bout ten 

 inches in circumference, evidently intended to bruise seeds or hard substances. 



In other caverns he has found other human bones, which show equally the 

 characteristics of fossils, being deprived of all the gelatinous parts, and con- 

 sequently very brittle and porous in the fracture. They were, unfortunately, 

 unaccompanied by the bones of any other animals, so that the principal point 

 of the question remains undecided; although they go to prove the antiquity 

 and prolonged existence of the human race on this continent.

The above, then, my dear Sir, is a brief synops-is of Dr. Lund's 1. tter, 

 which may, perhaps, have already reached you by way of Europe; but 

 of this I am not assured, and have determined to send it. 



Having given you the general feature of the letter, it would be presump- 

 tuous in me to hazard any remark to one so skilled in Anthropology ; and I 

 would only suggest, that fossil remains are not confined to Minas Geraes, 

 but are also found in the western part of this Province, and in Bahia. 



Nfar the city of Rio de Janeiro of course nothing of the kind has been dis- 

 covered, as the formation is entirely Granitic ; but from the point where the 

 calcareous rocks commence, (about ninety miles inland, near Canto Gallo,) 

 I am informed that fossils are abundant. 



I take this opportunity to express my thanks to you, personally, and to the 

 members of the Academy generally, for the honor conferred by my election 

 as a corresponding member, and for the kind interest they have taken in 

 my enterprise, and 



Remain, dear Sir, 



Your most obd't. servt, 



I. G. Strain.

Meeting for Business^ February 27, 1844. 

 Mr. Pearsall in the Chair. 



The Monthly Report of the Corresponding Secretary was 

 read and adopted. 



The Committee to whom was referred the following paper, 

 read at the last meeting, reported in favour of publication. 



On a supposed New Species of Hippopotamus. 



By S. G. Morton, M. D. 



It is about six months since I received from my friend Dr. 

 Goheen an extensive series of skulls, of mamrniferous and other 

 animals, from Western Africa. They had been obtained by him 

 during a residence of several years at Monrovia, where he had 




February, 1S44,] 15 



officiated as Colonial Physician ; a situation which gave him 

 great advantages for procuring the natural productions of that 

 region. Amoncf these crania were two of a Hippopotamus, of 

 small size, from the river St. Paul's. Although nothing could be 

 more manifest than the difference between the head of this ani- 

 mal ant! that of the common species, I have hesitated to publish 

 it, from a fear that some one else may already have done so ; for 

 I could hardly convince myself that so remarkable a species was 

 wholly unnoticed in the systems. Having, however, searched 

 the latest European works on Zoology without finding any account 

 of this interesting animal, I venture to submit the following facts 

 in relation to it. 



Hippopotamus minor.

 Dental Formula :

Length of the skull, measured from the anterior extre- 

 tremity to the notcl/between the condyles of the occipi- 

 tal bone, - -' 12.3 



Zygomatic diameter, ..--._ 8. 



Parietal diameter, 3.5 



Distance between the orbits over the surface of the 



skull, ........ 3.9 



Vertical diameter of orbit, ... - - 2. 



Horizontal diameter of orbit, - . - . - 1.8 



These measurements have been taken from a very old indivi- 

 dual, in which the sutures are entirely obsolete, and the teeth 

 worn almost to the level of the jaw ; and the contrast in size, be- 

 tween this and the large or common species, (familiar to every 

 one as the H. amphibivs, but recently divided into two species, 

 the H. capensis and H. Senegalensis,) will be manifest to every 

 one. The difference, however, is not only in size, but in 




16 [Februarv, 1844. 



all the proportions of the head, as the subjoined drawings will 

 show : 



In the H. minor there is a uniform convexity of the upper sur- 

 face of the cranium, from orbit to orbit, and between the occiput 

 and ossa nasi; while in the common species the orbits are remark- 

 ably elevated, and the intermediate surface is concave. The orbit 

 is placed about midway between the occiput and snout, and the 

 latter is consequently short : while in the large species the orbits 

 are placed about one-third the distance between the occiput and 

 snout. The H. minor has only two canines in the lower jaw; 

 the false molars are proximate to the canines ; and the base of 

 the zygomze is in the same plane with the upper maxilla. 



The second skull of this species (which is of the same length 

 as the other,) is that of a younger animal ; for the sutures are 

 open, and the teeth in the process of changing from the deciduous 

 to the permanent set. The posterior molars are only partially 




February, 1844.] 17 



protruded, and rise obliquely from the jaws, like those of the 

 Elephant and Mastodon. 



Dr. Goheen, who assured me from the first that he could find 

 no notice of this animal in the systematic works, has obligingly 

 favoured me with the following memorandum in relation to it. 

 " This animal abounds in the river St. Paul's, and varies in 

 weight from four hundred to seven hundred pounds. They are 

 slow and heavy in their motions, yet will sometimes stray two or 

 three miles from the river, in which situation they are killed by 

 the natives. They are extremely tenacious of life, and almost 

 invulnerable, excepting when shot or otherwise wounded in the 

 heart. When injured they become irritable and dangerous, but 

 are said by the natives never to attack them when in their canoes. 

 The negroes are very fond of the flesh, which seems to be inter- 

 mediate in flavor between beef and veal." 



My comparisons with the common Hippopotamus have been 

 made on four specimens, (three of which are fully grown,) two 

 from the vicinity of the Cape of Good Hope, and two from the 

 Senegal river. 



The Chevalier Amedeo Avogardo, of Turin, was then 

 elected a Correspondent of the Academy.

Fortj'-seven species of Plants of Missouri, including several 

 species of Cuscuta recently described by Dr. Engelmann, 

 of St. Louis ; and also several of Torrey & Gi'aj^'s new 

 species of Desmodium, Hed3^otis, Ambrosia, &c. From Dr. 

 Engelmann. 



One hundred and ninet}^ specimens of Coleopterous, Hemip- 

 terous, Lepidopterous, and other insects, from the vicinity 

 of Newark, Delaware. Collected and presented by Dr. 

 Thomas B. Wilson, of Newark. 



Mr. T. R. Peale presented a travelling case from the Sand- 

 wich Islands, formed of sections of a g-ourd of large size. 



Mr. Cassin stated a fact, which he considered as worthy 

 of record : that, during the past winter, the Snow Owl (Strix 

 njxtea, L., Nyctea Candida, Sw.) had been observed in the 

 vicinit}' of Philadelphia, and in the adjoining states of New 

 Jersey- and Delaware, in numbers unusually great for this 

 latitude. At a moderate calculation, he supposed that not less 

 than one hundred specimens had been shot and exposed for 

 sale in the markets, and at a very trifling price. Several of 

 them had been seen for many da^'S successively upon the 



3

roofs of houses, chimne}^ tops, and other elevated places, in 

 the city itself, during the verj' severe weather of Januar}'. 



As this is a Ijird almost exclusively' confined to extreme 

 northern latitudes, its appeai'ance here in such large num- 

 bers, is to be solely attributed to the great severity' of the 

 season to the North.

 From feinoralus, Say, which it somewhat resembles, it differs, aside of 

 other characters, it being much larger.

Descriptions of New Species of North American Coleoptera. 

 By John L. Le Contk.* 



1. Galerita dubia. Nob. Length U lines, breadth 'â– >[ lines. 



Head black, frontal impressions oblong, shallow : palpi and first joint of 

 the antenna' ferruginous : remainder of the latter brown. 



Thorax ferruginous: posterior transverse impression tolerably marked, 

 straight; longitudinal line very slight: basal impressions shallow. Elytra 

 black, stria; impunctate, beneath dark brown : legs and under part of the 

 thorax ferruginous. Inhabits Georgia. 



Uiflfers from G. Le Contei, Dej., in not having a red spot on the heail, 

 and in the basal impressions of the thorax, which are shallower: from G. 

 hicolor, Drury, (G. Americana, Dej.,) in having the longitudinal line of the 

 thorax less impressed, and the posterior transverse impression more dis- 

 tinct. The thorax is also less retracted posteriori}- : it diflers from all the 

 other species in having the striiv of the elytra impunctate. 



2. Plochionus viHatus. Nob. Lengih 4 lines, breadth 1| lines. Fer- 

 ruginous: tips of mandibles and eyes black: frontal impressions oval, 

 very deep: thorax covered with transverse wrinkles: transverse impres- 

 sions scarcely visible : longitudinal line entire, deeply marked : basilar 

 impressions deep, oblong, and transverse : a wide and deep fovea impressed 

 on each side near the middle of the thorax : lateral margin widely depressed 

 towards the posterior angles. 



Elytra, with a broad black sutural vitta, and a lateral spot of the same 

 colour behind the middle: striae deep, impunctured. Body and legs dark 

 ferruginous. Inhabits Florida. 



3. Aptinus americanus. Dej. Cat. Length Splines; breadth '2\ lines. 



Head, thorax, and legs ferruginous. Antenna ferruginous, growing 

 dusky towards the extremity. Head smooth, with a deep and long lv)ngi- 

 tudinal impression between the eyes: eyes black. Thorax sparsely 

 punctured : transverse impressions none : longitudinal line well marked : 

 with a few transverse wrinkles on each side. 



Elytra bluish-black, costs smooth : intervals deep, wide, and punctured. 

 Sternum ferruginous : abdomen very dark brown, almost black. Inhabits 

 Georgia. 



Resembles much in form and size Brachinus quadripennis, but it is 

 narrower, and the elytia are less parallel. 



4. Brachinus stretiuus. Nob. Length 7| lines : breadth 'il lines. 



Head, antenna, palpi, thorax, sternum, and legs ferruginous : abdomen 

 d?rk brown, with a reddish spot in the middle of the upper part: head 

 sparsely punctate, particularly at the posterior part. Thorax scarcely 

 wider than the head, thickly punctured. 



* Communicated by the Entomological Society of Pennsylvania. 




April, 1844.] 49 



Elytra bluish-black, punctured : interstices of the costa; narrow at the 

 bottom. Inhabits Georgia. (Common.) 



Resembles both the fumans, Fabr.. and libra/or, Dej. ; but the thorax is 

 narrower and more rounded anteriorly than the former, and less so than 

 the latter. The head is larger and the frontal impressions broader than 

 in either: the antenn;e are thicker and darker than in the fi/nu/ us, but 

 want the darker spots observable on those of the Hbrator. The elytra are 

 wider, the interstices are deeper than in either, and wider than in the 

 fumans. 



5. Brachinus Le Contei. Dej. Cat. Length 6 lines: breadth 2^ lines. 

 Inhabits Georgia. 



Resembles the viridipennis, Dej., mnA perplexus, Dej. : the former in size 

 and form, the latter in form, but is easily distinguished by the frontal 

 impressions, which are shallotv and punctate : in the viridipennis they are 

 still shallower and more punct-ite : in the perpleici/s they are rugous : the 

 tirst two joints of the antenna? and base of third and fourth, are ferru- 

 ginous : tips of these last are brown : in both the remainder is brown, but 

 in the perplexus the third only is brown at the tip. The thorax is wider 

 before : the anterior angles are sharper and more projecting. Elytra deep 

 blue to blackish blue. Abdomen deep reddish brown. 



6 Braohinus ci/anopterus. Dej. MS. Length oH lines : breadth 2| 

 lines. Inhabits New York. 



Resembles the cordico//is, but is larger, and easily distinguished by the 

 deeper and brighter blue of the elytra: the antenna' are likewise ferru- 

 ginous, without spots, growing darker towards the extremity. The thorax 

 is rather narrower anteriorly, and the costie of the elytra are more appar- 

 ent. Abdomen red, sides brownish. 



7. Brachinds viridis. Nob. Length 6 lines : breadth 2\ lines. Inhabits 

 Georgia. 



Resembles the viridipennis, but is narrower : the thorax is not so much 

 rounded on the sides, the basal impressions are more distinct. The elytra 

 are of a paler and brighter green, more thickly and coarsely punctured; 

 the costte are more strongly marked. The first two joints of the antennie 

 and a spot on the third are ferruginous : in the viridipennis the first three 

 and sometimes the four are ferruginous, with a small brown spot on the 

 third and fourth. 



8. Brachinus neijlectus. Nob. Length 5J lines: breadth 2f lines. 

 Inhabits Georgia. 



Somewhat resembles the quadripennis, but is larger and proportionally 

 broader; the elytra are of the same bluish-black colour, but less rounded 

 at the anterior nngles, they are more distinctly costate, and the intervals 

 are narrower. The tirst two joints of the antenn* are ferruginous, and 

 the rest brown, whilst in the qiiadripennis the base of the third is also fer- 

 ruginous. The thorax is also more retracted posteriorly, and the anterior 

 angles more acute ; the basal impressions are prolonged and extend almost 

 to the middle of the thorax. 



9. Brachinus tenuieoUis. Nob. Length G lines : breadth 2J lines. 




50 [April, 1844. 



Also resembles the qvadripennis, but the elytra are more blue, and the 

 first five costie of the elytra are more apparent than the rest, and are 

 impunctured on the top. The first two joints of the antenn><? and baae 

 of the third are ferruginous, the rest brown. Sides of the head coarsely 

 punctured, frontal impressions longer, more rugous and more punctured. 

 The thorax is more retracted posteriorly, wider and more rounded 

 anteriorly. 



10. BuACHiNUS palnielis. Dej. Cat. Length 4Hines ; bread 1|. In- 

 habits New York. 



Resembles somewhat B. cordicollis, but the frontal impressions are 

 longer: first three joints of antenna? and base of fourth ferruginous: the 

 third has a small brown spot at the extremity, and the remaining joints 

 are also brown. In the cordicollis the two first and base of the third only 

 are ferruginous : thorax much wider and more rounded anteriorly. 

 Elytra bright blue, costa; slight, and much less elevated than in the 

 cordicollis.

17. Clivin.a. impressefrorDs. Nob. Length -3] lines: breadth ; line. 



Dark rufous : front with three wide and deep longitudinal impressions, 

 the middle one abbreviated at the ends, so as to form an oblong fovea.

 deeply impressed. Elytra narrower than the thorax, parallel : striate, 

 striae punctate : third interval with three impressed points. Inhabits 

 New York. 



Resembles C, rufe.icens: but diflFers from it in being larger, in having 

 the front deeply impressed, and the elytra narrower than the thorax. 



18. Clivina convexus. Nob. Length 2^ lines ; Breadth | line. 



Head and thorax black : the latter convex and round : anterior trans- 

 verse impression scarcely visible : median line distinct. 



Elytra piceous, with a large transverse rufous sutural spot near the 

 extremity : deeply striate : strife strongly punctate, with but one im- 

 pressed point on the third interval, near the extremity. Inhabits Georgia. 



Resembles the C. bipustulatm ; but is readily distinguished by its 

 rounded thorax and the very slight anterior transverse impression. 



19. Rembus striatopunclatus. Nob. Length 6| lines : breadth 3^. 



Black, shining: palpi black, with the extremity of each articulation 

 rufous: antennae blackish-brown: frontal impressions deep, incurved at 

 the middle, as in the imprexsicollis. Medial line of the thorax deeply- 

 impressed, and abbreviated at both ends : transverse impressions indistinct, 

 basal ones deep, with an inwardly deep cut furrow beyond the middle. 



Elytra striate : striaj punctate : the second one incurved at the tip: the 

 third and fourth and fifth and sixth united at the tip : interstices convex, 

 with an impressed point on the middle of the third rudimental striae, a 

 mere point between first and second striae. Inhabits Pennsylvania. 

 Found at Carlisle by S. F. Baird. 




April, 1844.] 51 



Diflfers from R. im/irexaicoZ/is in tke transverse impressions of tlie thorax 

 which in that species are very distinct, also in tlie basal impressions and 

 in the striie of the elytra being very distinctly punctured : in the uapres- 

 sicollis they are (juite smooth. It is a much larger insect. 



20. Rembus axximifis. Nob. Length of lines : breadth 2 J lines. 



Black, shining : palpi and antennae dark ferruginous brown ; head as in 

 the prece ing : medial line of the thorax deep: anteriorly abbreviated: 

 posteriorly reaching to the base: posterior transverse impression deeply 

 marked in tlie middle : striie of the elytra punctate : the second not in- 

 curved ; third interval with an impressed point in the middle: an indis- 

 tinct rudiment of a striae at the base between the first and second. 

 Inhabits Georgia. 



At first sight this insect strongly resembles an anisodactylus, but it 

 possesses all the characters of the genus to which I have referred it. 



21. Chl.enius congener. Nob. Length 7 J lines ; breadth, 3 lines. 



Head and thorax coppery, with a greenish tint, the punctures on the 

 latter large and confluent. The thorax obcordate, slightly narrowed 

 behind: medial line deeply impressed, abbreviated anteriorly, and not 

 reaching posteriorly farther than the posterior transverse impression, 

 which is very deep and strongly marked : basal impressions very deep, 

 oblong, rather inclining inwards : elytra bHck, with a tinge of blue, striie 

 scarcely punctate : body beneath black, palpi, first three joints of antennae 

 and legs ferruginous. In other respects same as C. cobalfiniis. Inhabits 

 Georgia. 



Closely resembles C. cobaltinus; but is easily distinguished by the trans- 

 verse posterior impression of the thorax, which is much deeper. The 

 medial line does not extend so far backwards, and the elytral stride are 

 scarcely punctate. 



22. CwLiEHivi patruelis. Dej. Cat. Length 6]-7 lines: breadth 2|-3 

 lines. 



Above green, -beneath black : antenn;e and legs ferruginous. Head 

 coarsely punctured particularly at the posterior part : fiontal impressions 

 distinct. Thorax very coarsely punctate, much longer than wide, nar- 

 rowed before and behind, subcordate, much curved on the sides : medial 

 line on account of the close and deep punctures not very apparent : basal 

 impressions deep and triangular. Elytra much wider than the thorax, 

 covered with a short reddish pubescence: striae punctured; intervals 

 plane, covered with fine and close punctures. Inhabits Georgia. 



Resembles slightly the Kericea-i, but is distinguished at first sight by its 

 narrow thorax. 



23. Badister (erminalis. Nob. Length 2^ lines : breadth | line. 



Head, thorax, and body beneath black : palpi, antennic, cox;c and legs 

 ferruginous, frontal impressions of the head, very large and shallow. 

 Thorax smooth, obcordate, the angles rounded, the posterior less than the 

 anterior: transverse impressions well and deeply marked the anterior 

 incurved : longitudinal line entire and deep : rounded posterior margin a 

 little elevated and reddish. Elytra smooth, piceous, with tlie margin 

 suture, and large spot at the base ferruginous, gradually changing into

the piceous colour of the remainder. Striie very iatlistinctly punctured. 

 Third interval with three impressed points rather indistinct. Inhabits 

 New York. 



24. Badister testacetis. Nob. Length 2 lines ; breadth | line. 



Smooth, shining, t^estaceous, inclining to piceous on head and elytra : 

 joints of the anteume gradually increasing to the extremity : frontal im- 

 pressions deep and rounded. Thorax obcordate, lengthened, scarcely 

 wider than the head: anterior angles rounded, posterior acute, anterior 

 transverse impression tolerably marked, posterior one obsolete : longi- 

 tudinal line Well marked and entire: basal impressions deep, oblong. 

 Elytra wider than the thorax parallel, almost plane, deeply striate, striaj 

 covered with small transverse wrinkles a little oblique, which cutting the 

 striae, give ihem an almost reticulated appearance. Inhabits Pennsylvania. 



25. Bauister micniis. Nob. Length 4^ lines ; breadth 1^ lineg. 



Black: head, rhiuariuni, and upper lip testaceous, palpi ferruginous, 

 with a black spot on ihe last joint: antenmc brown, the first two joints 

 rufous: frontal impressions rather larger, distinct: an impressed point 

 near each eye. Thorax plane black, margined with reddish brown : the 

 margin sinuate near the posterior angles : base rugose : transverse impres- 

 sions tolerably distinct. Longitudinal line deeply marked. Basal im- 

 pressions large and ileep. Elytra piceous, irridescent, not sinuate at the 

 extremity ; strnc tolerably deep, impunctured: intervals broad and plane. 

 Third interval with two impressed points. Body beneath piceous, legs 

 testaceous. Inhabits Georgia. 



This insect difiers vÂ£ry :much in its general appearance from all the 

 species of this genus, and it may perhaps be necessary hereafter to sepa- 

 rate it from the genus in which 1 have placed it. 



26. OoDES picipes. Nob. Length 5^ lines : breadth 2] lines. 



Resembles the amencanus, but is smaller; the palpi and antennae are 

 entirely piceous ; the thorax is more convex ; the posterior transverse 

 impression is scarcely visible ; the longitudinal line almost obsolete : basal 

 impressions very shallow and indistinct: the elytra are more deeply 

 striate; and the striie are impunctate : the third interval with two im- 

 pressed points : underside of the body black : legs piceous. Inhabits 

 Georgia. 



27. Pristonychus a7?ie?vVY/Â«Â«s. Nob. Length 5 J lines; breadth 1 J lines. 



Apterous; black, shining: beneath smooth: palpi, antenn.e, and legs 

 dark ferruginous ; frontal impressions tolerably deep and slightly rugous ; 

 thorax, oblong, almost square, wider than the head, narrowed behind, the 

 anterior angles projecting, posterior ones rounded: covered with very 

 slight transverse undulating wrinkles : lateral margin elevated posteriorly ; 

 the base cut almost square : anterior transverse impression small, in- 

 curved : posterior deeply marked ; mesian line deep, abbreviated at each 

 end by the transverse impressions, the anterior of which cuts it at right 

 angles : basal impressions oblong, deep, slightly rugous. 



Elytra wider than the thorax, lightly convex ; not sinuated at the ex- 

 tremity ; deeply striate ; striiÂ» impunctured, with two impressed points

on the third interval, near the second strise ; rudimental strise at the base, 

 short and straight ; epipleuroe with a longitidinal elevation near the base. 

 Inhabits Georgia. 



28. CAL.A.THUS dititinguenidvs. Nob. Length 5] lines ; breadth 2 lines. 



Piceous black, shining, smooth ; palpi, antennae and legs ferruginous ; 

 front with a small impression at the base of the antennaj, and a linear one 

 near the eyes: thorax smooth, with some indistinct transverse undulating 

 wrinkles, quadrangular, narrowed before, the anterior angles projecting 

 and a little rounded, base cut square, so as to make the posterior angles 

 almost right, lateral margin rufo-piceous, a little curved, dilated, and 

 depressed posteriorly : anteriorly : anterior transverse impression toler- 

 ably distinct : posterior well marked ; meilial line slight, abbreviated by 

 the transverse impressions : with the anterior of which it forms an angle, 

 so as to leave a well defined triangular depression in front : basal impres- 

 sions slight, scarcely distinct from the depressed base of the thorax. 



Elytra striate, striae impunctured, with three impressed points on the 

 third interval, the two upper ones near the third, the lower one close to 

 the extremity of the second strije. Inhabits Georgia. 



Larger than C. greyarius. which it very much resembles : the thorax, and 

 its margins are proportionally much wider, more curved, and more re- 

 flexed ; and it wants the impressed point on each side of the thorax near 

 the margin, which is very apparent in the yregarius : the anterior trans- 

 verse impression is strongly marked, whereas in C. gregarius, it is much 

 less apparent. It is also much darkened beneath. 



29. ANCHOMENtJs Le CoM<e/. Dej. Cat. Length 9', lines ; breadth 2 lines. 



Very much resembles the A. extensicolUs : but differs in the thorax being 

 wider and more rounded : the basal impressions are longer, perpendicular 

 to the base, and curving upwardly and outwardly ; whilst in the extensi- 

 rollis they are oblique, so as to make them wider at the base ; from this 

 last circumstance the middle of the base between the impressions is much 

 wider in A. Le Contei than in A. extensicollis. 



It may, however, prove to be nothing more than a variety.

Head large, wings steel blue, with a small yellow spot below the base of 

 the anterior pair: thorax lightly margined with yellow anteriorly; tarsi 

 fusceous. Somewhat larger than E. verticalis. Say, and distinguished by 

 tlie almost uniform black colour, and the base of tlie abdomen being fusi- 

 form, on account of the depth of the incisure. 



ScAPHiNOTUS fiammeiis. Reddish brown, head slightly transversely 

 rugose between the antennue: pronotum proportionally wider, and the

 margin, and several tarnished spots of green. 10 lines long. 



An imperfect specimen in the cabinet of the Academy, from Marietta, 

 Ohio. Distinguished from S. elevatus by the wider prothorax and elytra, 

 and lighter colour. Not having seen a female f the latter, I am unable 

 to point out its distinction from the proposed species. 



ScARiTES â– suhstrifitiix. Black, shining ; antennne, palpi, and tarsi dark 

 testaceous : head large, nearly as wide as the thorax ; mandibles wide at

Genus EurREPis, Dum. and Bibron. 



E. Blanilingii. The head is of moderate size, triangular, uavrow^ 

 flattened above ; the snout is somewhat prolonged and rounded in 

 front; the plates upon the upper surface of the head, as well as 

 those upon the sides are perfectly smooth ; the rostral plate is 

 large, pentagonal, presenting an obtuse angle at its summit ; the 

 nasal plates arc of moderate size, triangular, rounded posteriorly ; 

 the supero-nasal are narrow, oblong, in contact with each other; 

 the inter-nasal plate is larger, presenting the form of a lozenge 

 with it3 lateral angles truncated, the posterior angle is acute, the 

 anterior obtuse; it is in contact in front with the two supero-nasal 

 plates, its anterior angle not reaching quite so far as the rostral; 

 the fronto-nasal are of moderate size, sub-pentagonal, their lateral 

 and inferior margins are in contact with the superior margin of 

 â– the two frenal plates ; the freno-nasal plate is small, triangular ; 

 the first of the frenal plates is oblong-quadrilateral ; the second, 

 which is much the larger of the two, is pentagonal; the frontal 

 plate is pentagonal, much broader in front, rounded posteriorly; 

 the fronto-parictal are oblong pentagonal, their anterior margins, 

 or those which embrace the posterior margins of the frontal, are the 

 smallest^ they are in contact laterally svith the two supra-orbitar, 

 and posteriorly with the parietal and inter-parietal plates ; the 

 parietals are large, pentagonal ; the inter-parietal is larger than 

 either of the fronto-parietals, and terminates posteriorly in an ob- 

 tuse point ; there are four supra-orbitar and two freno-orbitar 

 plates ; the supra-orbitar are four in number, their exterior mar- 

 gin is bordered by a row of seven small oblong quadrangular 

 plates; immediately behind them is a small rhomboidal plate, the 

 upper half of which is received between the posterior supra-or-

bitar and the parietal plate; there is no occipital, but immediatelj 

 behind the parietal are two oblong scales, much larger than the 

 rest, presenting numerous strias, or elevated lines upon their pos- 

 terior margin; the labial plates are seven in number, of these the 

 fifth is most remarkable, it is regularly quadrilateral, oblonf, and 

 much larger than either of the others, forming of itself one-half 

 of the inferior margin of the orbit; the second, third and fourth, 

 are rhoniboidal ; the first is irregularly quadrilateral ; the sixth 

 and seventh are pentagonal; the ear is of moderate size; its in- 

 ferior margin is bordered with numerous small granules and 

 there are two or three small scales in front ; (he scales upon the 

 body are hexagonal, more or less rounded posteriorly ; those upon 

 the back, sides, and tail, present three carinas upon their surface 

 all of which are very distinct; here and there a smaller one may 

 bo observed at each extremity of a scale ; there are eight scales 

 immediately in front of the anus of nearly equal size. 



Colour. The head, back, and upper part of the tail is of a bronze 

 colour, with numerous spots of black ; these spots are more abun- 

 dant, and somewhat larger upon the upper part of the tail â€¢ there 

 is a row of white spots extending along the side of the neck and 

 body as far as the extremity of the tail ; a broad black band passes 

 along the side of the body, and one immediately behind the orbit 

 the former extending as far as the posterior extremities, becomino- in- 

 distinct upon the tail; immediately below this is a white narrow vitta 

 commencing near, the anterior extremity of the orbit and termina- 

 ting in a line with the inferior extremity of the forearm when 

 placed in contact with the side of the body ; under surface of chin 

 throat, abdomen and extremities of a light silvery gray colour 

 slightly tinged with green; a number of small conglomerated 

 spots of a black colour arc observed upon the chin.

Two letters were read from Mr. I. G. Strain, U. S. Navy, 

 Correspondent of the Academy, (now on an exploring tour 

 through the interior of South America,) addressed to Mr. 

 Plnilips and Dr. Morton, dated City of St. Paul's, Brazil, 

 February 26th, 1844 ; of which tlie following is an abstract : 



The party Iiad been reduced to three, Mr. Strait), Dr. Rein- 

 hart, and Mr. Christie, the otiiers having left tliem from sick- 

 ness and other causes. After having reached the head of 

 navigation on the river Tiete, it was ascertained that the un- 

 healthiness of the country through which they would pass in 

 descending that river, was such as to threaten the lives of the 

 party ; the natives positively refusing to accompany them in 

 the descent, and, without some assistance, tiie canoes could 

 not be dragged over the portages. In consequence of this, 

 the route was changed, and preparations made to descend the 

 Parana-Panema, which has remained unexplored. A covered 

 boat, twenty-two feet long and four feet beam, was built by 

 the party, and every preparation made to commence the de- 

 scent of the river in a few days. Dr. Reinhart had made 

 numerous collections in various departments of natural science, 

 although he was principal constructor of their little boat, 

 which was so. constructed as to be taken in pieces should it be 

 required. Mr. Strain had made two journeys to distant cities, 

 to complete arrangements for his expedition with the officers 

 of the government, and had at length returned, found all 

 ready, and the little party was on the eve of starting, in e.x- 

 cellent health and spirits, and full of hope and confidence. 



A letter was read from Mr. James Ombrosi, U. S. Consul 

 at Florence, Italy, -dated February, 1S44, acknowledging the 

 reception of his diploma, and announcing his intention of pro- 

 curing for the Academy, and forwarding by the earliest op- 

 portunity, certain publications of learned Italian Societies.

Dr. Morton exhibited the skull of a Hottentot, sent him by 

 Mr. T. Watson, (now re'sident near the Cape of Good Hope,) 

 through Dr. Gavin Watson, of this city. This is a female 

 head, remarkable for having the Negro ch<iracteristics very 

 strongly expressed. The face is prominent, the nose perfectly 

 flat, the head narrow and elongated, but the whole structure 

 rather tiiin and delicate. This cranium pertained to a woman 

 of about twenty years of age; the facial angle gives 75 de- 

 grees; but the internal capacity, or size of the brain, mea- 

 sures but sixty eight cubic inches, which, Dr. Mortoji re- 

 marked, was as small an adult brain (with a single exception, 

 and this, also, a native African) as he had ever met with. 

 Dr. M. has shown the mean internal capacity of the Negro 

 cranium to be 85 cubic inches ;* so that this Hottentot skull 

 presents a measurement of no less than 17 cubic inches below 

 the average.

 city, to establish a Zoological Garden in this vicinity ; that it 

 had been thought advisable to conduct the same upon the 

 most liberal atid popular plan ; and that it had been found 

 that it was likely to receive a large share of public patronage. 

 Mr. Browne remarked that, while such places of scientific 

 and moral instruction and amusement were quite conunon in 

 Europe, there v.-as not, so far as liis knowledge extended, 

 any thing of the kind in the United States; and that he 

 would feel gratified that so laudable an example should be set 

 in this city. 



Mr. Browne also remarked, that in furtherance of the plan 

 of a Zoological Garden, and in aid of its fund, there were 

 grounds to believe that several patriotic naturalists would 

 consent to deliver, at the ensuing season, lectures upon sub- 

 jects connected with Zoology, the proceeds to be appropriated 

 entirely to the above object.

 James Smithson, Esq. By Walter R. Johnson. Pliiladel-

Prof. Johnson made some remarks on the specimen of Plum- 

 bago mica presented this evening, and on tiie comparative 

 characteristics of other varieties of Plumbago from various 

 localities, and as an artificial product, all of which were ex- 

 hibited. 



The specimens of Plumbago from Saybrook occur in felspar, as- 

 sociated with, and passing directly into dark brown mica. Indeed 

 so intimate is the union of these two minerals, that in several in- 

 stances the folia are mica on one edge, and plumbago on the other. 

 It is in some cases difficult to determine where the micaceous cha- 

 racter begins and where the plumbaginous ends. The mass has, 

 with the exception of possessing a crystalline form, much the aspect 

 of some samples of furnace cinder from anthracite iron works which 

 have fallen under Prof. J.'s notice, and which exhibited large folia- 

 ted portions of keech or artificial plumbago, passing into a greyish 

 shining, silicious mass of nearly the same colour as the brown mica 

 which accompanies the plumbago of Saybrook. 



The only mineral with which plumbago is liable to be confounded 

 by the casual observer, is sulphuret of Molybdenum â€” this mineral 

 is likewise represented by authors to occur in or near Saybrook. 

 A specimen of the sulphuret of Molybdenum which Prof Johnson 

 had tried, possessed a specific gravity of 4.6676. A specimen of 

 fibrous plumbago presented at the last meeting, (probably from Cey- 

 lon,) had a specific gravity of 2.200 ; a fragment of the plumbago 

 from Saybrook 2.353 ; a specimen of plumbago from Russia 3.227 ; 

 and a mass of plumbaginous deposite from the interior of a gas re- 

 tort, derived probably from the decomposition of bicarburetted hy- 

 droffen, had a specific gravity of 1.957. The relation between the 

 several specimens of plumbago and their contrast with the sulphuret 

 of molybdenum, are sufiiciently indicative of the true nature of the 

 specimen this evening presented. The peculiar silvery colour, and 

 the greenish streak of the sulphuret were also referred to and ex- 

 hibited in contrast with the darker grey colour, and the similarly

tinted streak of plumbago as conclusively fixing the character of 

 the specimens under consideration. 



The occurrence of plumbago in numerous localities associated 

 with coal, was alluded to, and the fact was noticed, that in these 

 cases the beds of altered ov graphitlzcd coal, are generally in close 

 proximity with igneous rocks. 



This natural conversion of coal into plumbago, with the artificial 

 production of it in the iron furnace, the sras retort and other similar 

 situations, together with its existence in primary rocks, or in the 

 fissures of adjacent sedimentary rocks, appear to point to a common 

 origin of the material in all these cases. 



Prof. J. proposed to give at a future meeting some further illus- 

 trations of the subject. 



Resolutions were adopted, accepting a proposal from Dr. 

 â€¢Morton to purchase from the Academy for a proper con- 

 sideration, the remaining half of the range of cases in the 

 South flying-gallery,for the purpose of accommodating an ad- 

 ditional portion of his collection of Crania â€” and also authori- 

 sing the Curators to have erected forthwith, a similar range 

 of cases for books in the North flying-gallery, j

78 [August, 1844. 



Dr. Zantzinger called the attention of the Society to the specimen 

 of milky fluid or juice derved from the Cow tree of S. America, 

 which had been presented at the last stated meeting by a lady of this 

 city. As this was a substanceof peculiar interest, and the opportunity 

 of obtaining or of seeing it here very rarely occurred, he stated tliat he 

 had, on these accounts, been induced to collect from various sources 

 some information relating to it, which he would now present to the 

 Society. Most of the facts had been obtained froni Curtis' ]jotanicaI 

 Magazine, Vol. 13, new series. 



The tree affording this milk is a native of Venezuela, and was 

 first discovered by Humboldt in the year 1802, and was believed 

 by him to be peculiar to the Corderilla of the sRore, between a plan- 

 tation called Barbula and the Lake of Maracaybo, a district of country 

 extending from the 65th to the 71st degree W. Longitude, and from 

 the 9lh to the 1 llh degree N. Latitude. It grows in situations elevated 

 probably from 3000 to 4000 feet above the level of the sea, and in 

 a temperature of which the annual mean is from 65Â° to 70Â°. It is 

 called by the natives Palo de Vaca, and is highly prized by them. 



The botanical character of this plant is not yet accurately 

 determined. Its flowers having never been seen by botanists, 

 the class and order to which it belongs cannot therefore be ascer- 

 tained. The fruit is known, and has been figured and described. 

 By some it has been considered as a species of Brosimum, by others 

 as belonging to the natural family Sapoteae; but it is now generally 

 regarded as a new genus, to which the name Galaclodendron, ori- 

 ginally suggested by Humboldt, has been applied. Its generic cha- 

 racters are given by Kunth, in his ' Synopsis Plant. ^"Equinoc' 

 He places it among the Urlicea?, and has called it Galaclodendron 

 utile. The fruit is a monosperm, contained in a green covering or 

 rind, and as represented in Curtis' Botanical Magazine, is not unlike 

 in size and shape the fruit of the Hickory or Walnut. 



Humboldt's description of this tree is to be found in his 'Relation 

 Historique,' Vol. 2. He states that, while on his route, for some 

 weeks he had heard much of a tree called the Cow tree, whose 

 juice is a nourishing milk, and that the natives, regarding it as such, 

 consumed large quantities of it. This was to him an extraordinary 

 fact, as almost all lactescent vegetable fluids are unpalatable, and 

 inore or less poisonous. 



He found, however, that the statements he had received were not 




August, 1S44.] ''' 



exaggerated, as he had subsequently ample opportunities of judging 

 from trials made of it himself. He says : " It was a gluey and 

 thickish milk, destitute of acridity and exhaling a very agreeable 

 balsamic odour. It was offered to us in calabashes, and though 

 we drank large quantities of it, both at night before going to bed, 

 and again early in the morning, we experienced no uncomfortable 

 effects." The viscidity of this milk was the chief objection to it. The 

 natives and slaves used it freely, and became visibly fatter during 

 the season when the Palo de Vaca yields most milk. 



Other naturalists and travellers have since confirmed these state- 

 ments of Humboldt. Healso says; " none of the wonders of these tro- 

 pical regions so riveltedmygazeas did this tree, growing on the sides 

 of rocks, its thick roots scarcely penetrating the stony soil, and un- 

 nioislened for many months in the year by a drop of dew or rain. 

 But dry and dead as the branches appear, if you pierce the trunk, a 

 sweet and nutritive milk flows forth, which is in greatest profusion at 

 day-break. At this time the blacks and other natives of the vicinity 

 hasten from all quarters, furnished with large vessels to catch the 

 milk, which thickens and turns yellow on the surface. Some drink 

 it on the spot, others carry it home to their children, and you might 

 fancy you saw the family of a cow-herd gathering around him and 

 receiving from him the produce of his kine."'^ 



Sir Robert Ker Porter, British consul at Laguayra, at the request 

 of Sir Wm. Hooker, visited in the month of May, 1837, the region 

 where the Palo de Vaca is found. Accompanied by some of the na- 

 tives, with great difficulty and fatigue, and through a dense and un- 

 travelled forest, and at an elevation which he supposed to be 4000 

 feet above the level of the sea, he reached a group of these trees, 

 and at once made an incision into one of them, ' from which flowed 

 the milk, white and limpid as that of the cow, sweet to the palate, 

 and accompanied by an aromatic smell, but leaving a clamminess 

 upon the lips, and upon the tongue a slight bitter.' He was enabled 

 in a short time to obtain a considerable quantity, although less than 

 was usual, as his visit was made during the decrease of the moon, 

 when this fluid is said not to be so abundant as during its increase. 



The trunks of the trees seen by him measured in some instances 

 20 feet in circumference, and had attained an altitude of at least an 



â€¢Curtis' Botan. Mag. Yol. 1.3, ripw series. 




so [August, 1844. 



hundred feet. The trunk frequently rose sixty feet before it 

 branched ; the branches spread on each side 25 or 30 feet, and from 

 30 to 40 feet higher. They were densely clothed with foliage of a 

 rich and velvety green colour. Tlie leaves measured from 10 to 

 16 inches in length, and 2 to 4 inches in breadth. The wood was 

 white, hard and very close grained, and the bark of the larger 

 branches was of a yeliovvish colour.* 



An analysis of the milk of the Palo de Vaca, was made in the 

 year 1823 by MM. Rivero and Boussingault, and published in the 

 23d vol. of the Annales de Chimie, of which the following is a sum- 

 mary : 



This vegetable milk possesses the same physical properties as 

 that of the cow, except in being rather viscid : but in chemical pro- 

 periies it materially differs. 



It mixes readily with water in all proportions, is not curdled by 

 acids, and is rendered more liquid by ammonia, which latter cha- 

 racter shows the absence of caoutchouc â€” alcohol slightly coagulates 

 it. When fresh it slightly reddens turnsol. At the temperature of 

 100Â° Cent, it boils. When slightly coagulated by alcohol, the 

 more liquid portion may be passed through a tilter. This when 

 evaporated to the consistence of a syrup and treated with rectified 

 alcohol, developes a little sugar, but the greater part is insoluble. 

 The insoluble portion has a bitter taste, and by chemical manipu- 

 lation may be made to yield a salt of a magnesian character. 



Under the action of heat, the milk of the Palo de Vaca presents 

 at first the same phenomena as that of the cow. A pellicle is quick- 

 ly formed on the surface, which prevents the disengagement of 

 aqueous vapour. Upon the pellicle being raised as fast as formed, 

 and the evaporation continued carefully at a moderate heat, oily 

 drops begin to form ; these increase in proportion as the water is 

 driven off, and at length unite into an oily liquid, in which floats a 

 fibrous substance which shrivels up according as the temperature of 

 the oil increases. By proper measures the oily matter may be con- 

 verted into a substance of a yellowish white colour, solid, translucent, 

 resisting pressure, insoluble in water, soluble in hot alcohol and in 

 the essential oils, &c., and in fact resembling refined bees-wax, and 

 applicable to the same purposes. 



â™¦Curtis' Botan. Mag., Vol. 13, new series. 




AuODST, 1844.] 81 



The JihroKs substance is of a brown colour, and witliout taste; 

 upon a hot iron it swells, then becomes shrivelled and carbonised, 

 giving out an odour like that of broiled meat. Oiher experiments 

 with this fibrous matter showed its close similarity to animal fibre. 



The constituents of the milk of the Cow tree, as ascertained by 

 MIM. Rivero and Boussingault, are therefore, Ist, wax: 2d, fibrine : 

 3d, a little sugar: 4th, a magnesian salt: and 5th, water. 



Another analysis has been made by the celebrated Mr. Thomson, 

 and published in bis Vegetable Chemistry. He regards the substance 

 called fibrous by Rivero and Boussingault as having many cha- 

 racters similar to those of cork. He also discovered in it a new 

 substance which he called Gnlacline, obtained by evaporating the 

 milk to dryness by a gentle heat, and digesting the residue in hot 

 alcohol. Upon the solution cooling, an abundance of snow while 

 flakes are deposited, which constitute the Galactine, of which he 

 gives the ultimate analysis. 



The specimen on the table is a portion of some brought by the 

 Brig Caraccas, Capt. Dill, which sailed from Porto Cabello on the 

 2d July last. It was furnished at the request of a gentleman of 

 this city, by a resident of Porto Cabello. The bottle in which it 

 was pent, contained abfuit a pint, and was labelled ' Leche Palo de 

 Vaca;'and the letter accompanying it, gave some particulars re- 

 specting the mode in which it was obtained. 



The long peritid wliich has elapsed since it was taken from the 

 tree, has necessarily occasioned an alteration in some of its sen- 

 sible properties. 



In colour and consistence it can scarcelj- be distinguished from 

 ordinary milk; but the smell resembles that of sour or stale cheese, 

 and the taste is not of course agreeable. If allowed to remain un- 

 disturbed for some time, it separates spontaneously into two portions ; 

 an upper and by far the largest portion, which is thick and viscid, 

 and a thinner one below, which is transparent, of a greenish yellow 

 coldur, and very like the whey of ordinary milk. When exposed 

 to the air, it quickly thickens and becomes of a dark colour. 



Dr. Z. stated that he hoped to have an opportunity to exhibit at 

 a future period, spiecimens of the fruit, leaves, and probably the 

 flowers of this interesting plant; as he had been kindly promised 

 by the gentleman alluded to above, that every effort should be made 

 to obtain them for the Academy.

August, 1S44.] 



83 



This species is wholly unlike any other, fossil or recent, willi 

 which I have been able to compare it. It seems to form an inter- 

 mediate link between the Gavials and true Crocodiles, for the snout, 

 though long and narrow, is gradually and not abruptly produced 

 from the head, and has probably been from eight to twelve inches 

 longer than it now is. 



This remarkably large and admirably preserved relic was found 

 in the cretaceous limestone which overlies the ferruginous marl near 

 Vincentown, in New Jersey, and has been obligingly presented to 

 our Institution by General William Irick (on whose farm it was 

 discovered,) and William Whitman, Esq., of this city. These strata 

 of cretaceous limestone were first discovered and announced by me 

 in 1829 ; in which year I published an account of them, with a list 

 of their organic remains, as observed at Timber creek, in Gloucester 

 county.* Since that period I have continued my researches into 

 this interesting section of our geology, which I have subsequently 

 identified in two other localities in New Jersey, viz. Vincentown and 

 the vicinity of Salem, and also in South Carolina west of Charleston ; 

 at which latter place the fossils have been chiefly collected by Dr. 

 Raveuel, who is preparing for publication a description of several 

 species hitherto unknown. 



I obtained from Timber creek at my first visit, a fragment of the 

 jaw of a Crocodile with three teeth; but the parts were not suf- 

 ficiently perfect to enable me to decide to which division of this class 

 of animals it pertained. Upon comparing it, however, with the spe- 



* Vide Journal of the Acad. N. S., vol. VI. 




84 [August, 1844. 



cimen now under consideration, it appears to belong to a Gavial, 

 and in all probability to the G. clavirostris. 



Dr. Harlan, many years ago, described the remains of a fossil 

 crocodile from the lower or ferruginous beds of this series.* These 

 fragments enabled Dr. Harlan to reconstruct the head so far as to 

 identify it as a true crocoaile, to which he gave the name of C. 

 maa-orhyncus.i This species is figured in the fourth volume of the 

 Journal of the Academy, and the fossil itself is preserved in the So- 

 ciety's collection. 



During JMr. Lyell's recent visit to this country, he also obtained 

 some fragments of a fossil crocodile which appear to belong to the 

 Procaelian division of this family.J 



Prof. Buckland remarks that " as there were scarcely any mam- 

 malia during the secondary periods, whilst the waters were abun- 

 dantly stored with fishes, we might, a priori, expect that if any 

 crocodilean forms had then existed, they would most nearly have 

 resembled the modern Gavial. And we have hitherto found only 

 those genera which have elongated beaks in formations anterior to, 

 and including the chalk; whilst true crocodiles, with a short and 

 broad snout, like that of the cayman and alligator, appear for the 

 first time in strata of the tertiary periods, in which the remains of 

 mammalia abound. 



This remark would seem to conflict, in a geological sense, with 

 the observations of Dr. Harlan, as just quoted, because his descrip- 

 tion and figure correspond to those of a true crocodile ; while the 

 C. clavirostris seems, as we have remarked, to possess an interme- 

 diate organic structure. 



M. Geofi'roy St. Hiliare has divided the fossil Gavials into two 

 genera, viz : Teleosaums and Steneosaurus, which chiefly diff'er from 

 each other in the position and form of the anterior termination of 

 the nasal canal. As the terminal portion of the snout of the present 

 specimen has not been discovered, we cannot avail ourselves of this 

 generic distinction ; and this uncertainty must continue until the re- 

 covery of the deficient portion may enable us to decide the question.

Professor Johnson then offered some remarks on (he speci- 

 mens of rocks presented by him this evening. 



Those from tte sammit of Mount Washington are quartz, coarse 

 granite, and tourmaline, with quartz filling its fissures, and plates 

 of mica adhering to its crystals. Those from the northwestern 

 slope of the same mountain are hornblende, and tabular masses of a 

 micaceous rock, in which the folia are laid in narrow bands ob- 

 liquely inclined to each other. Ail these materials are very durable 

 in their nature, and suifer little from mere atmospheric influence. 

 In strong contrast with these are many of the rocks found at the 

 White mountain notch. The latter are generally more or less 

 friable in their nature, and liable to pretty rapid detrition. They 

 consist of beds of gneiss, intermixed with others of a granitoid cha- 

 racter, having the aspect and constituents of granite, but the loose- 

 ness, and friability of gneiss which has been long exposed to the 

 weather. The hardest specimens obtained from that part of the 

 notch which contains the celebrated Willey house, are mixtures of 

 quartz and serpentine. 



A portion of the masses having a granitic aspect has since the 

 catastrophe which happened to the Willey family about 18 years 

 ago, become completely disintegrated, and fallen into small gra- 

 nules. 



The event just alluded to seems to furnish, to a considerable es- 




90 [September, 1844. 



tent at least, a solution of the present aspect, if not of the very 

 existence of this notch. The numerous and extensive scars which 

 the mountain still bears, derived from that occurrence, with others 

 obviously produced by similar means, but of a more ancient date, 

 and not in the notch only, but also in the numerous recesses all 

 along this mountain chain, point significantly to the causes which, 

 through innumerable ages, have been operating upon the gradual 

 degradation of the softer portions of these elevated regions. The 

 notch is stated to be, at its highest part, about 2000 feet above the 

 level of tide water. For the first few miles the decent is very 

 rapid, and the head of the Saco is truly a mountain torrent. This 

 steep acclivity favors the rapid action of water in washing down 

 the looser portions of the rock formation â€” aided as it is by the al- 

 ternate wetting and drying of the rocks. 



The Chairman announced to the Society the decease, on 

 the 5th September last, of Miss Anna Maclure, at the resi- 

 dence of her brother Alexander Maclure, Esq., at New Har- 

 mony, Indiana. The zeal with which this lady, in common 

 with her brother, has ever promoted the objects and interests 

 of this Institution, will indissolubly connect her name with 

 its past and future history, as one of its earnest friends and 

 liberal benefactors. 



On motion of Professor Johnson, the letters of the late 

 Rev. Mr. Melsheimer, presented to the Academy this even- 

 ing, were referred to the Library Committee, with directions 

 to have them bound and placed in the Library.

 Prof. Espy. 



Philadelphia, Sept. 22d,1844. 



Dear Sir, â€” I send you an extract of a letter which I have 

 lately received, which is only one of many in my possession, 

 going to prove that rain may be produced by man in time of 

 drought. 



"Dear Sir, â€” The undersigned citizens of Coudersport, Pa., 

 and vicinity, desirous of rendering you what little aid they possi- 

 bly can, beg leave to present to you their testimonial of the fol - 

 lowing facts. 



On Saturday the 13th of July, about one o'clock, the fallow of 

 D. F. Ellsworth, Esq., containing about six acres, was fired. At 

 the time the fire was set, the day was calm and warm, and would 

 be considered clear ; there were some flying clouds, with slight 

 ippearance of rain to the North, but none in our neighborhood. 

 The fire spread rapidly and burned with great violence. 




92 [October, 1844. 



In a short time, a â€¢white cloud was seen to form over the black 

 smoke, which rose over the fire with great rapidity, nearly per- 

 pendicular. The white cloud rolled outwards above, especially 

 towards the North and South, and probably towards the East as 

 the wind was gentle in that direction, and as the rain which, fell 

 from it increased as it proceeded East, as far as heard from. It 

 did not swell out far towards the West. In less than an hour 

 from the commencement of the burning, very large drops of rain 

 were seen descending by many inhabitants of Coudersport from 

 the cloud, glittering in the sun like diamonds. 



It rained but little in Coudersport, which is about one hundred 

 rods west of the fire, and none at all one half mile west of the 

 village. 



This latter fact was remarked particularly by Charles Lyman, 

 who was ten miles west of Coudersport, at the time of the burn- 

 ing, and who found the road very dusty until he came within a 

 few rods of the village, when the first edge of the shower made 

 its appearance. Mr. Lyman lives two miles east of Coudersport 

 and he found the quantity of rain which had fallen constantly in- 

 creased as he advanced. When he got home he found the ground, 

 quite wet; previous to the rain it was quite dry and parched, 

 suffering much for want of rain. 



Samuel Taggart lives six miles east of the fire, and at his 

 place the shower was very violent, and lasted about thirty min- 

 utes. Some of our citizens watched the whole formation of the 

 cloud and its gradual recession towards the East after the rain, 

 and we have understood from credible authority that it rained 

 hard and much longer many miles to the East the same after- 

 noon. 



We are unanimously of the opinion that the rain was produced 

 by the burning of the fallow, and we think it due to your zeal in 

 the cause of science to make this communication to you. 

 Yours, 



John S. Mann, Att. at Law. 

 Charles Lyman, 

 W. C. BuTTERWORTH, Att. at Law. 

 Samuel Taggart, 

 John B. Pradt, Epis. Clergyman, 

 David T. Hall.

Description of some new species of Fossil Organic remains, from 

 the Eocene of South Carolina. By Edmund Eavenel, M. I>- 

 of Charleston, S. C* 



Genus PECTEN. 



1. JPecten Mortoni. Specific character â€” Orbicular, thin, both 

 valves moderately convex, one more so than the other â€” outside? 

 with numerous concentric obsolete strise ; inside, with from eighteen 

 to twenty-four radiating double ribs, slightly elevated ; ears large, 

 sub-equal, striated externally. 



This species is nearly allied to the P. plewonectus and P. Japo- 

 nicus. It is found in the limestone on my plantation. The Grove, 

 in St. Thomas's Parish, about 17 miles from Charleston, and also on 

 Goose creek, at Mr. Henry Smith's, about 7 miles South West from 

 the Grove deposite, and 11 miles from Charleston ; Cooper River 

 being between these two localities. 



This shell is abundant at the Grove, but being large and thin, it 

 is generally broken in getting out the marl, and with the exception 

 of a few small specimens, I have not been able to procure a perfect 

 valve. 



The largest specimen in my possession although not perfect, is 

 suflSciently so to determine its size ; it is 8| inches in diameter. 



I take much pleasure in designating this shell by the name of our 

 distinguished Geologist, Dr. Samuel George Morton, of Philada. 



2. Pecten Holbroohii. Specific character. â€” Orbicular, convex 

 with twenty-three large, prominent, somewhat flattened ribs, smooth, 

 margin strongly dentate ; ears large, nearly equal, obscurely rib- 

 bed, within deeply channeled on the hinge margin ; cavity of the 

 ligament triangular, deep. Transverse diameter 5^ inches, longi- 

 tudinal diameter 4| inches. 



Detached valves only have fallen into my hands. It occurs in my 



* It is designed to give wood-cuts of these interesting species in a future 

 number.

own marl pits, at tlie Grove, with the P. Mortoni, but more rare- 

 ly. I have fragmeats of larger specimens than the one described ; 

 from these fragments it is probable that both valves are convex, one 

 a little more so than the other. 



I have dedicated this species to our learned herpetologist, Pro- 

 fessor Holbrook, of Charleston, S. C. 



Genus TEREBPvATULA. 



Terebratula canipes. Specific character. Larger valve, pear- 

 shaped, convex ; beak rather large and prominent; seven plates ex- 

 tending from the anterior, and part of the lateral margin to about 

 two-thh-ds of the shell towards the beak, three of these occupying 

 the middle, and two others, less prominent, each of the sides ; mar- 

 gin deeply toothed by the plaits. Length If inches, width If 



inches. 



I found a single valve in the limetone thrown out for agricultu- 

 ral purposes at the plantation of Dr. I. Gl. Prioleau, in St. John's 

 Parish, S. C, about five mile south of Black Colt, on the Santee 

 Canal. It was associated with fragments and casts of various 

 species which could not be determined with certainty, with the ex- 

 ception of ''Pecten ealvatus," (Morton,) " Ostrea panda," (Morton,) 

 and ''Scutella Lyelli," Pileus sinensis, (nobis.) 



The marl on this property is conveniently obtained from the 

 bottom of a small creek, which is often nearly dry, and as it varies 

 in hardness, the deposit has been examined at difi"erent spots within 

 a half mile. At one of these places, about 200 yards from that at 

 which I found this Terebratula, the Scutella pileus-sinensis is cu- 

 riously abundant and perfect, and is almost the only fossil which 

 can be determined. In a few cart loads thrown out, and not used 

 from being too hard, thousands of this fossil are visible. 



Unfortunately, the rock is generally too hard to permit their re- 

 moval; occasionally a good specimen may be procured, but gene- 

 rally they are broken in the effort to separate them. 



Genus SCUTELLA. 

 ^cMteZ?apt7eMS-smerjsw.â€” (Mandarin's hat.) Specific character: 

 Orbicular; posterior margin slightly truncated, with two slight in- 

 dentations opposite the posterior ambulacra ; margin thin, least so 

 anteriorly. 




98 [October, 1844. 



Apes a little anterior to the centre and very much elevated and 

 rounded ; ambulacra rather short. 



Beneath slightly concave, with five compressed, lines correspond- 

 ing with the ambulacra, dividing at about half their length into 

 two, and then running on, becoming less distinct, to the margin. 

 Diameter three inches. 



This fossil is found abundantly in a mass of limestone on the 

 estate of Dr. PhilipG. Prioleau, in St. John's Parish, S. Carolina, 

 about six miles south of Black Oak Lock of Santee Canal. 



The limestone is excavated for agricultural purposes, and in 

 spreading it upon the fields^ numerous very perfect specimens are 

 thrown out. 



The elevation of the apex is very remarkable, and at once dis- 

 tinguishes this species from any other with which I am ac- 

 quainted.

The Committee to whom was referred a commurjication 

 from Dr. Morton, containing observations on Ancient Egyp- 

 tian Crania, reported in favor of publication. 



Ohservations on a second series of Ancient Egyptian Crania. 

 Towards the close of the year 1842, Dr. Lepsius, the distin- 

 guished head of the Prussian Scientific Commission in Egypt, re- 

 opened several very ancient tombs in the vicinity of the Pyramids 

 of Ghezeh. These tombs date with the third and fourth dynasties 

 of Egyptian chronology, as is proved by their inscriptions ; but 

 having been the receptacles of wealthy individuals, they were no 

 doubt plundered in very remote times ; and whenever succeeding 

 generations have again devoted them to sepulchral purposes, avarice 

 has renewed its desecrations in the search for treasure. Thus, the 

 Hykshos, Persians, Greeks, Romans and Saracens, have probably 

 each in turn violated these tombs ; leaving it a question of entire 

 uncertainty, whether the embalmed bodies now found in them belong 

 to the earlier or later epochs of Egyptian history. I make these 

 remarks to show that I do not infer the age of these mummies from 

 the date of the tombs ; but at the same time it may be observed, 




October, 1844.] 123 



that in the mere search for plunder there waa no occasion to de- 

 stroy or eject the bodies of the dead ; and mutilated as they are, it 

 is possible that some of them may have pertained to a very remote 

 age. 



3Iy friend Dr. Pickering, writing to me from Cairo about the 

 time of these explorations, observes that Dr. Lepsius expected to 

 find " the veritable remains of the primeval Egyptians; but it was 

 discovered that they had been displaced by Greeks, &c., and that 

 there was nothing of this sort older than Psammeticus." (B. C. 550.) 

 The bodies that retained their legends may have been of Greek 

 and other comparatively modern inhabitants of Egypt ; but with re- 

 spect to the seventeen skulls before us, I have no hesitation in declar- 

 ing, that but two of them could have belonged to persons of Greek 

 or any other Indo-European lineage. The others may have borne 

 Greek inscriptions, but that would not make them Greeks ; for the 

 language of the latter people was the compulsory vernacular tongue 

 during most of the Ptolemaic epoch. Moreover, the skulls in 

 question are entirely denuded of bandages and even of integuments ; 

 whence it seems evident that no inferences drawn from Greek or 

 other inscriptions could have applied to them. 



The following is an Ethnographic analysis of this series of 

 crania :

1 . The Egyptian form is admirably characterized in eleven of 

 these heads, and corresponds in every particular with the Nilotic 

 physiognomy, as indicated by monumental and sepulchral evidences 

 in my Crania ^gyptiaca, viz. â€” the small, long and narrow head, 

 â– with a somewhatreceding forehead, narrow and rather projecting face, 

 and delicacy of the whole osteological structure. No hair remains, 




124 [October, 1844. 



and the bony meatus of the ear corresponds with that of all other 

 Caucasian nations. 



Two other heads present some mixture of Negro lineage with the 

 Egyptian, which is expressed in the conformation and expression 

 of the facial bones, more particularly as seen in th& greater breadth 

 and flatness of the face, and a stronger development of the upper 

 maxilla. 



Of these thirteen crania, eleven are adult, of which the largest 

 has an internal capacity of 93 cubic inches, and the smallest 76, 

 giving a mean of 86 cubic inches for the size of the brain. This 

 measurement exceeds, by only three cubic inches, the average de- 

 rived from the entire series of Egyptian heads in my Crania 

 ^gyptiaca. 



The facial angle of the adult heads gives a mean of 82Â°, the 

 the largest rising as high as 86*^, and the smallest being 78Â°. Two 

 other heads are those of children, in whom the Egyptian conforma- 

 tion is perfect, and these give, respectively, the remarkable large 

 facial angle of 89Â° and 91Â°. The mean adult angle is greater than 

 that given by the large series measured in the Crania ^gyptiaca. 

 Is this owing to the fact, that the heads now under consideration 

 belonged to persons of distinction, and probably, therefore, of edu- 

 cation and refinement ? 



These crania, as already observed, are long and narrow, and 

 receding in front'; but posteriorly, in the parietal regions they be- 

 come much broader ; the whole occiput is very full, and remarkably 

 projecting ; the sides of the cranium are rather flat, and the coronal 

 region long and depressed. 



2. The Negroid head, as I have elsewhere explained, is a mix- 

 ture of the Caucasian and Negro form in which the Id^iier predomi- 

 nates. Such is the case in the present instance, as even a partially 

 practised eye can readily discover. This head strongly resem- 

 bles those of two modern Copts in my possession. It gives 81 cubic 

 inches for the size of the brain, and a facial angle of 80. It is re- 

 markable for deep depressions on the lateral surfaces of the parietal 

 bones, apparently caused by the action of the posterior portions of 

 a powerful occipito-frontalis muscle. Among six hundred skulls in 

 my collection, but two present this development in an equal degree ; 

 one of these is an Egyptian, the other a Hindoo head.

3. Of the two Pelasgic heads, one is perfect, and well character- 

 ised in most of its proportions. It has an internal capacity of 93 

 cubic inches, and a facial angle of 80**. The other head has lost 

 the bones of the face, whence its ethnographic relations are not so 

 obvious ; and I have ventured to judge it by its cranial developments. 

 It is internally but two cubic inches smaller than the other. 



4. The solitary Semitic head, has rather the common Arab, than 

 the Hebrew cast of features. It measures internally 78 cubic 

 inches, and has a facial angle of 79". 



The ages of the individuals to whom these seventeen skulls 

 pertained, may be proximately stated as follows : 5, 7,* 18, 20, 20, 

 25, 30, 40, 40, 40, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 55. 



The results derived from this series of crania, sustain in a most 

 gratifying manner, those obtained from the greater collection of 

 one hundred skulls sent me from Egypt, by my friend, George K. 

 Gliddon, Esq., and which have afforded the materials of my Crania 

 Egyptiaca ; and without making further comparisons on the present 

 occasion, (for I design from time to time to resume the subject, as 

 facts and materials may come to my hands,) I shall merely subjoin 

 my^Ethnographic table from the Crania Egyptiaca, so extended as 

 to embrace all the ancient Egyptian skulls now in my possession. 



Ethnographic Table of one hundred and seventeen ancient Egyptian Crania. 



It remains for me to add, which I do with great pleasure, that I 

 am indebted for this second series of Egyptian Crania, to Mr. Wm. 

 A. Gliddon, of Cairo, who, prompted by that extraordinary interest 

 in Egyptian questions which seems inherent in his family, has 

 availed himself of every opportunity for extending our knowledge 

 of the people and the monuments of ancient Egypt. 



* The two juvenile heads are of course not used in calculating the mean 

 either of the size of the brain or the facial angle. 




126 [October, 1844. 



A letter from Dr. Richard Lepsius, head of the Prussian 

 Scientific Commission in Egypt, was read at the meeting of 

 the 23d of July last, but accidentally omitted in the last num- 

 ber of the Proceedings. It is addressed to Mr. Gliddon, and 

 dated at Khartoon, (junction of the White and Blue Nile,) 

 March 29, 1844. After returning thanks for his election as a 

 Corresponding member of this Society, he concludes his letter 

 with the following highly interesting announcement : 



" The most important result of my visit to the Pyramids 

 of Begerawe, and the temples at Ben Naga, Naga and the 

 Wadee e'-Sofra, is, that all these monuments ascend, as an 

 extreme, as far as the times of the Ptolemies ; and date, for 

 the most part, about the first centuries of our era. I hasten 

 to examine the Ethiopian monuments of Mount Berkal, 

 which date at least as far back as the seventh century before 

 Christ."

Dr. Morton exhibited an interesting and numerous collec- 

 tion of fossil bones of the Mosasaurus, from New Jersey, con- 

 sisting of 3S nearly perfect vertebrae, a perfect tooth, several 

 fragments of other bones, and perhaps the most remarkable 

 of all, a perfect coprolite^ or portion of fossil excrement of 

 this animal. 



These had all been recently obtained from the ferruginous 

 sand near Mount Holly, New Jersey, and were presented to 

 Dr. Morton by Mr. Wm. L. Bispham of this city. 



Dr. Morton then proceeded to make some brief observa- 

 tions on the general characters of the European Mosasaurus, 




November, 1S44.] 133 



and pointed out some differences which a comparison of the 

 specimens on the table with the descriptions of that species 

 would seem to indicate. 



These differences he beheved to he sufficient to authorize 

 a new specific name, and he therefore proposed that of 

 M, occidentalis. 



In the absence, iiowever, of more positive information on 

 this subject than heat present possessed, he stated that he 

 preferred that this specific designation should ba considered 

 as merely provisional.

i 0. castaneus. Testaceous; head armed with two long erect horns. â€” 3h 1. 

 Jong. Pennsylvania. 



Light chestnut, clothed with very short ochraceous hairs; head with the front 

 profoundly and distantly punctured, with two long erect horns between the 

 eyes, and with the clypeus almost innpunctured, reflexed and slightly repand at 

 tip ; glossy : antennae pale ochraceous ; thorax densely and profoundly punc- 

 tured, moderately excavated each side before, and lobate in the middle; obtusely 

 grooved behind the middle : elytra each with six fine striae, interstices finely 

 punctured : pygidium with large, profound and vicinal punctures: beneath and 

 feet rufo-piceous, with the anterior pair of tibia dusky. The 5 differs from 

 the % in having the thorax of dark-green, the head, as in common, with two 

 transverse ridges in place of the horjis, and the clypeus densely transversely 

 wrinkled.

 foundly punctured, slightly excavated each side before, and slightly lobate in the 

 middle, with the lobe feebly concave in the middle; dorsal groove obsolete be- 

 hind the middle ; black, with a greenish reflection: elytra finely striate with the 

 interstices finely punctured ; pygidium punctured as in the preceding species : 

 venter black, opake: pectus pitchy-black : feet pitehy-chesnut.

Black; head with a long erect horn on the vertex, being cylindric towards 

 the tip and flattened and dilated at base ; profoundly and distantly punctured, 

 each puncture furnishing one or two rufous hairs ; clypeus with the margin re- 

 flexed, and faintly emarginate at apex; thorax much punctured, and clothed 

 with short rufous hairs; a fine glabrous dorsal line ; anterior edge slightly re- 

 tuse : elytra fulvous, confluently maculate with black, finely striate, interstices 

 with irregular series of minute and distant punctures; hirsute like the thorax: 

 pygidium punctured as in castaneus : beneath and feet black, glossy : pectus and 

 under part of the head with long rufous hairs. The 2 differs from the ^ in 

 being destitute of the occipital horn, instead of which the head is armed with 

 two prominent transverse ridges, of which the anterior one is arcuated; the cly- 

 peus is also very rough with punctures. Distinct from the O. nuchieomis,

 and profoundly punctured, with a prominent acute tubercle each side before, 

 margin { (destroyed) thorax retuse each side in front, with a broad bifid central 

 lobe, projecting over the head; dorsum obsoletely channelled behind ; punctured, 

 and clothed with short rufous hairs ; green : elytra faintly striate, the interstices 

 minutely punctured ; green, with the base and apex irregularly testaceous : py- 

 gidium punctured, superior half rufo-testaceous : beneath and feet green. Of 

 this species there is only a single specimen in our collection. 



0. latebros7is, Ya.hv.â€”heca.te, Panz. The ^ of this species varies much in 

 the length of the thoracic central lobe, being in some specimens only half the 

 common length, and in others it is still less, being represented only by two small 

 tubercles. Fabricius described a % , and Panzer figured and described a 5 ; 

 the name of the latter having the priority ought to be adopted.

 cylindrical form. The sculpture of the elytra resembles those of a C/(rj(soJo/ArjÂ« 

 but they are entire at the lateral edges, and not serrated.

December, 1844.] 163 



Professor Johnson exhibited specimens of coal coke, cinders, and 

 lumps of pyrites, from a heap of about 250 tons of bituminous coal, 

 from the line of the summit portage Railroad, in Cambria ccunty, 

 Pennsylvania. This coal had been lying for five or six months in 

 the coal yard of 3Ir. Nathan Middleton, south west corner of E-idge 

 Road and Willow street, and was yesterday morning (December 2, 

 1844,) found to be on fire from spontaneous combustion, burning 

 through a board fence between the coal yard and the adjoining pre- 

 mises, very near the ground. The height of the pile, above the 

 point where combustion commenced, was about nine or ten feet. 

 On applying a thermometer at three feet distance, in a horizontal 

 direction from the fire, the temperature was found to be only 70 

 degrees ; but by digging down over the same point to within four 

 foot of the level of the fire, the temperature was 160 degrees. 



One of the specimens exhibited, on a surface of deposition, a yel- 

 lowish white pellicle of pyrites, which, from the minuteness of the 

 crystals, resembles frost-work; another has distinct plies or seams 

 of the sulphuret continued through the lumps ; a third is a nodular 

 lump of nearly pure pyrites ; and a fourth is a fragment of a reni- 

 form mass of the same material, weighing upwards of three pounds, 

 with a film of adhering coal. The interior of the mass is some- 

 what porous, with a slight intermixture of carbonaceous matter; while 

 the exterior is a shell of much more compact structure. Clusters 

 of crystals, of considerable magnitude, are here and there seen. On 

 the part coated with coal are seen films or dissepiments, penetratinn- 

 the coal at right angles to the surface of the kidney-shaped mass. 

 On one side the coal has been polished, apparently by sliding under 

 immense pressure over some hard substance, giving it the appear- 

 ance of " slickensides." In this part, the projecting partitions of 

 sulphuret of iron, as well as the coal, have been broken down, 

 crushed and flattened, and the direction in which the folia have been 

 bent, marks that of the motion which had occurred in the bed. 



Professor Johnson also exhibited the pei-oxide of iron adherino- to 

 the coke formed in this spontaneous ignition, and referred to the de- 

 composition of sulphate of iron, without access of air, as capable of 

 producing that oxide. Also, to the simultaneous development of 

 anhydrous sulphuric acid and sulphurous acid as the volatile pro- 

 ducts. The latter acid, when generated in the combustion or dis- 

 tillation of bituminous coal, passes off in combination with ammonia. 




164 [Decembeu, 1844. 



giving rise to the sulphite of amraonia, one of the known products 

 of the gas making process. 



Reference was made to the first volume of the Proceedings, page 

 140, for an account of another case, not of actual combustion, but 

 of the heating to 110Â° of a heap of coal from the same coal district ; 

 and to an instance which had come tinder the observation of Prof. 

 Johnson, at Lowell, Massachusetts, where, having found a tem- 

 perature of 160" in a heap of Sidney, Nova Scotia, coal, at a dis- 

 tance of three feet from the surface, a period of 50 days was allowed 

 to elapse, in which time it actually took fire. 



The importance to coal dealers of attending to the character of that 

 which they store and keep on hand for months, was rendered apparent 

 by the occurrence now alluded to. Had the combustion occurred on 

 another side of the heap, it would have set fire to a coach maker's shop 

 filled with combustible materials. Had it been on ship-board, the 

 planks and timbers might have been charred, or the vessel set on 

 fire, with scarcely the possibility of extinguishing the flames. The 

 decomposition of sulphuret of iron, found in such abundance in this 

 coal, aided by air and moisture, aifords a ready solution of this and 

 similar occurrences. 



Dr. Gibbons exliibiled a diagram, intended to show ihe 

 path of the thermotneter as compared wilfi that of the baro- 

 meter, ill which the great fluctuations of the former iiistiu- 

 ment ate observed to follow those of the latter al a distance 

 of about thirty-six hours.

 caloriiic power of coals, and particularly on the Osage coal 

 of INIissouri, and on a specimen of pure bitumen. He then 

 gave a resume of the several varieties of coal which he had 

 assayed, and compared the'practical evaporative powers, as 

 determined by steam generating operations, with the calcu- 

 lated powers of the same coals, as ascertained by determining 

 the proportion of its carbon constituent. The accordance is 

 very striking, being 10.701 for the mean of the results given 

 by steaming operations, and 10.691 by ultimate analysis. An 

 abstract of this valuable and elaborate paper will be furnished

Mr. Gilpin exhibited a recent rib-bone of a cetaceous animal, 

 whicii had been fomid by Dr. Morris, in the middle of a 

 forest in the State of Delaware, at a distance of about six

Dr. Morion read a communication from Dr. Alfred T. 

 Kinsj-, of Greensburg, Pennsylvania, and intended for publi- 

 cation, in relation to the fossil foot marks found in his vicinity, 

 casts of which were presented by him at a late meeting of the 

 Academy. Referred to the following Committee: Dr. 



Morton, Mr. Phillips, and Mr. Cassin. 



Dr. Morton submitted the following observations on the 

 measurements of the internal capacity of the crania deposited 

 by bin) this evening. 



In the Society's Proceedings for Decembsr, 1S41, I cora- 

 municafed the result of the internal measurement of forty-five 

 skulls of native Africans, of the Bassa, Grabbo, Makoua, 

 Benguela, Mina, Mozambique, and other but undetermined 

 tribes, Tliose measurements gave S5 cubic inches for the 

 internal capacity of the cranium or size of the brain. More 

 recently I have received, through the kindness of Dr. Goheen, 

 twelve additional skulls of native Africans, of which ten are 

 adult, and aflord the following measurements : 



The lar-rest iieads in the series ara those of two Kroomen, 

 which afford respectively a capacity of 92 and 95 cubic 

 inches. The smallest head, that of a female, (tribe unknown) 

 measured but t)5 cubic inches, which is the smallest adult 

 cranium I have hitherto met with ; while the mean of all 

 Fives a fraction more than 84 cubic inches. Of this series of 

 heads, nine are male, and one is female ; and they are derived 

 from theKroo, Golah, Pessah, Dey, and Eboe tribes. 



In addition to these, I possess a single female Hottentot 

 skull, which measures fiS cubic inches; and if we take the 

 niean of the whole adult series of fifty-six crania, we find it 

 to be about 85 cubic inches, whicli may be assumed as the 

 average bulk of the brain in the Negro race ; thus confirm- 

 ing, in a very satisfactory manner, the results of my previous 

 observations.

The Committee on Mr. Conrad's paper on n<;w fossii 

 shells of the United States, reported in favor of publication. 



Descripiio7is of eight nevj Fossil Shells of the United States. 

 By T. A. CoNEAu. 

 Miocetie Species. 



CuEPlDrLA.. 



Ckepidula cymbceformis. Elliptical, very profound cr venliicose; thicU 

 about the region of the beak; apex inclined towards the left margin, acute, 

 separated from the margin of the aperture; umbo compressed, prominent: 

 aperture dilated above the middle and rapidly narrowed towards the eniS 

 opposite the beak ; diaphragm concave and remote from the margin. Length 

 li inch. 



Locality. Petersburg, Virginia. 



The boat-shaped outline of this shell serves to distinguish it from its con- 

 geiicrs. It is the deepest or most ventricose of all the smooth species of the 

 Union 



Eocene Species. 



Cardita. 



Cardita densata. Obliquely cordate, ventricose, thick, â– with about 

 t'.venfy-five flattened costae, obsolete towaids the base, narrow, profound, 

 elevated and crenulated on the umbo ; umbo very prominent at the apex ; 

 anterior basal margin obliquely subtruncated ; posterior extremity truncated, 

 direct; cardinal area very thick and dilated, the teeth oblique. Height If 

 inch. Length the same. 



Locality. Claiborne, Alabama. 



This pretty species abound? in entire specimens in the argillaceous stratun". 

 near low water mark in the Claiborne Bluff. I found none in the upper 

 beds. Compared with C. planicosta, it is much smaller, comparatively 

 shorter, thicker, and may always be readily distinguished by the crenulated 

 tibs on the umbo. 



Cytherea. 



Cytheeea siihimpressa. Ovate, slisrhtly ventricose, smoo'h and polished, 

 with concentric slightly impressed lines on the anterior side ; anterior side 

 short, rather acutely rounded ; posterior side produced, acutely rounded at 

 the extremity; dorsal marsin long, oblique, slightly curved : beaks promi. 

 dent ; lunule lanceolate, defined by a slightly impressed line. Length 1^ inch- 

 Height 8_inch. 



1 



Locality. ^larlbourne, Hanover county, Virginia. Mr. Ruffin, 




174 [December, 184}. 



This species may be distinguished from C. cequorea, by its greater com- 

 parative lenath, smaller size, and in wanting the strong furrows ofthatspe 

 cies. Mr. Ruffin obtained several entire specimens. 



C. Uciata. Suboval, thin and fragile, convex-depressed, surface with mi- 

 nute, closely arranged concentric lines ; anterior margin rather acutely 

 rounded; posterior margin obtusely rounded or subtruncated obliquely out- 

 wards, the extremity rounded ; lunule lanceolate, defined by an obscure line; 

 beaks prominent, and profoundly curved towards the anterior margin. Length 

 1 inch. Height ^ inch. 



Locality. Marlbourne, Hanover county, Virginia. Mr. Ruffin. 



This species is related to the C. ovata, Rodgers, but is more compressed, less 

 dilated posteriorly, the striae more numerous and distinct on the middle of 

 the valves, while the ovata has there only lines of growth. 



Ceversa. Suborbicular or lenliform, ventricose surface with fine, closely 

 arranged concentric lines ; anterior and posterior extremity rounded; basal 

 margin profoundly rounded, and forming a regular curve from the extremi- 

 ties ; umbo broad, with a prominent apex ; lunule ovate-acute, marked by a 

 well defined impressed line; cardinal teeth robust. Length 3| inch. Height 

 If inch. 



Locality. Marlbourne, Hanover county, Virginia. 



This shell has much the exterior aspect of an Artemis. Mr. Ruffin has 

 one specimen with both valves. It occurs at Marlbourne, the residence of 

 Edmund Ruffin, Esq., who Is making important investigations in the Eocene 

 deposits of that locality. He has kindly sent me beautiful specimens of 

 Cardita planicosta and Cardium Nicolled , together with the new species of 

 Cytherea above described. 



C. pyga. Suboval, ventricose, thick, with closely arranged robust con- 

 centric lines ; umbo wide, prominent above; dorsal margin very oblique, 

 rounded ; posterior extremity obtusely and obliquely rounded inwards ; an- 

 terior extremity much narrower than the posterior, and more acutely 

 rounded ; lunule lanceolate, defined by a distinct impressed line ; cardinal 

 teeth robust. Length IJ inch. Height H inch. 



Locality. Potomac river, Stafford county, Virginia. Mr. BrufF. 



1 am indebted to Mr. BrufF, of Washington, for an opportunity to describe 

 this species. The specimen is a right valve, very perfect, and in outline 

 has some resemblance to C. liciaia, but is larger, thicker, more ventricose. 

 with much wider umbones, &c. 



Pecten. 



Pecten elixatns. Suborbicular, inferior valve ventricose, with fourteen 

 wide, elevated, rounded ribs, and with concentric wrinkles. Height Ij 

 inches. 



Locality. Near Santee canal, South Carolina. 



Occurs in friable limestone. 




December, 1844.3 ^'â– ^ 



Carloniferozts specieS' 

 Belleeopheox. 



Bellerophron scissile. Dilated, profoundly ventricose from the margins 

 of the aperture, and with coarse, transverse, irregular lines ; back subangu- 

 lated medially and with a medial channel, angulated and slightly carinated 

 on the margins, the channel profound from the margin of the aperture to the 

 middle of shell, and obsolete on the other portion of the back. Length 2 

 inches. 



Locality. St. Genevieve. 



The Committee on a conmiiinicatioti from Dr. Alfred T. 

 King, of Greensbiirg, Pennsylvania, describing fossil foot 

 marks recently discovered in his vicinity, reported in favor 

 of publication. 



Description of Ihssil Foot llarJcs, supposed to he referable, to the 

 classes Birds, Rejitilia and Mammalia, found in the carhoni- 

 ferous series, ia Westmoreland county, Pennsylvania. 



Bj Alfred T. King, 31. D. 



The petrifaction of tracks of animals once almost universally doubted, is 

 now no longer a problem to be solved, and Ichnolology or Ichnolithology is 

 admitted as a distinct branch of Palaeontology. It is but an extension of the 

 principle of Cuvier, who proved experimentally, 'â€¢' that when we find merely 

 the extremity of a well preserved bone, we are able, hy a careful examina- 

 tion, assisted by analogy and exact comparison, to determine the species to 

 which it once belonged, as certainly as if we had the whole animal before us." 

 Professor Kauss, of Germany, Rev. Dr. Duncan, of Scotland, and Professor 

 Hitchcock, of Amherst College, have described various and singular foot 

 marks in the upper new red sand stone, but so far as my information extends, 

 they have never found either the inhumed bones, or any other decided indica- 

 tions of the existence of Birds, Reptilia, and Mammalia, as early as the car- 

 boniferous period. If I am correct in this statement, the discovery which I 

 am about to announce of the vivid imprint of the feet of animals referable to 

 these classes, and to this epoch, must be regarded with no ordinary interest 

 by geologists. 



If the discovery of bird tracks by Professor Hitchcockj in 1S36, as low as 

 the upper new red sand-stone, was received with skepticism by geologists, 

 their doubts may now be renewed with increased strength, when it is an- 

 nounced that birds existed analogous to cur Grallateres, and left their foot 

 marks in arenaceous mud, ages anterior to the deposite of the sand-stone of 

 Connecticut river. 



Professor Hitchcock originally denominated the bird tracks which he 



21-22 




^'^ [December, 1844. 



described Ornlthichnites, or stony bird-tracks, but afterwards changed the 

 name to Orniihoidichmtes, or tracks resembling those of birds. I am unable 

 to percpive the propriety of this change, inasmuch as it is universally con- 

 ceded that the tracks were made by birds. I trust, therefore, I shall be 

 pardoned for making use of the original, and in my view, more correct and 

 appropriate term, Ornithichnites. 



The first track which I shall describe is one evidently made by a bird, 

 referable to the order Gmllae, and allied to our Galiinules. I shall therefore 

 call it the 



No. 1.* Ornithichhites galliyiuloides. â€” Toes 

 4, three before, pointing forwards, almost entirely 

 separate, leptodactylons ; middle toe much the 

 longest ; spread of lateral toes 95*" ; hind toe point- 

 ing directly backwards (on one foot slight inclina- 

 tion inwards) on the same plane with the front 

 ones ; all the toes have long and pointed claws ; 

 length of the foot about nine inches ; length of 

 the step not easily determined, as it seemed to 

 vary from two to fifteen or eighteen inches. 



No. 2. Orhituichnites CÂ«<Z5er<*o>m. I have named 

 this impression after my friend Alexander Culbertson, 

 Esq., a gentleman of acute and penetrating mind, an ac- 

 curate and original observer of all subjects pertaining 

 to either morals or physics, and who had the kindness 

 first to direct my attention to these singular bird tracks. 

 The toes are 4, and much resemble the preceding, but 

 the hind toe is longer ; the front ones spread at an angle 

 of 70* ; length of the foot 4J inches ; length of the 

 step uniformly 11 inches. The tracks were nearly 

 in a straight line, and traceable over ten or twelve 

 feet surface, the last step leaving a vivid imprint on the perpendicular side 

 of the stone. This seems to indicate that the position of the rock has been 

 changed since these birds walked upon it, and left their foot prints upon the 

 then plastic mud, for the wonder and speculation of man in after ages. Ordi- 

 nary observers have uniformly compared these tracks to those made by wild 

 turkeys; but it does not require much ornithological knowledge to detect 



â€¢ This, and the succeeding cuts, are one-fourth of the size of the original 

 drawings. 




Decembek, 1844.] 177 



the incorrectness of this opinion. The hind toe of all j;allinaceous birds is 

 comparatively short, and is articulated with the tarsus higher than the rest. 

 When the bird is walking, this toe, therefore, scarcely touches the ground at 

 the tip. In one stony track the hind toe is long, on the same level with the 

 front ones, and the imprint is deep and vivid. 



No. 3, I imagine, is the track of an immense 

 Saurian reptile, for which I suggest the name of 

 Thenaropus* hptodactylus. The toes are five, 

 slender, spreading, like an open fan, 160Â°; 

 they are two inches long, with distinct claws; 

 the extreme spread five inches, leaving an in- 

 terval of one inch between each toe ; the ball 

 of the foot is spherical, and near 2^ inches 

 across it. 



No. 4 is the Thenaropus pachydactylus. 

 Toes are five, short and thick; the imprint is 

 deep ; the spread of the toes 5i inches. The 

 track resembles somewhat the preceding, but 

 the toes are shorter, thicker, the imprint is 

 deeper, and the foot is considerably larger. 



Nos. 5, 6. I am unable to form even a probable con- 

 jecture in regard to the class of animals to which it 

 should be referred. There is certainly some resem- 

 blance to the order Digitigrada, but as it is extremely 

 improbable that these animals should be associated 

 with aquatic birds and saurian reptiles, or that they 

 should be even represented at this early period of 

 our planet, during its half finished condition, and 

 while the proportion of land to water must have 

 been far less than what it is at the present day, 1 

 have almost abandoned the idea. It may have been 

 an animal in some respects allied to the Ilifiwpota- 

 mus. At all avents, I shall venture the provisional 

 name of Thenaropus sphcerodactylus. Toes are 5, 

 spherical, arranged in a circle, spreading acout 240Â°, 

 or two-thirds of a circle. The ball of the foot is 



* From 6fva^, a â€¢palm, and crt:/;, a footâ€”2i palm-footed animal ; which 

 generic name may serve, at least provisionally, for several others of this 

 series of footmarks.

spherical, and about one and a half inches across it. The track is four 

 inches in its transverse and conjugate dian^eters. In the specimen before 

 us, the ball of the foot is situated in the centre, the toes spreading regu- 

 larl)- around it ; but in some it stands out behind and completes the digital 

 circle. 



No. 7. Thenakopus ovoidactyhis. Toes 

 5, ovoid, spreading about 240*. This is 

 evidently the track of a very large ani- 

 mal. Each toe is about an inch long, 

 and their spread near six inches. The 

 ball of the foot is about two and a half 

 inches across it. 



The stone on which these tracks were found has an exposed surface of 

 fifteen by twenty feet, rising like the other rocks in the neighborhood to the 

 west, and dipping at a small angle to the east. It is a coarse grained sand 

 stone, about 150 feet beneath the largest of our coal seams, and near SOO feet 

 beneath the topmost stratum of our coal formation. From the fact of the 

 existence of numerous holes or pots, some of which will hold fifteen or 

 twenty gallons, excavated, as we know they are at the present day, by the 

 whirling of pebbles, set in motion by a running stream, I infer that the stone 

 must have Iain in the bed of a river which was subject to partial periodical 

 desiccation. These pots, which bear a striking resemblance to those now 

 found in our neighboring rivers, particularly the Youghiogheny, were the 

 objects of curiosity to the people of the neighborhood for years ; but the 

 tracks, though often noticed, were comparatively unimportant, as they pre- 

 sumed they were made by dogs, bears, wild turkeys, and other animals 

 belonging to the present order of animated nature. 



To the geologist, however, they are of more interest. He looks through 

 the long vista of time which has elapsed since the stone on which these tracks 

 are now found was plastic sand or arenaceous mud â€” contemplates its con- 

 solidation into stone â€” the subsequent excavation of these pots by whirling 

 pebbles â€” the deposition of sandstone, limestone, shale, and numerous beds of 

 coal, amounting, in all, in this vicinity, to about 800 feet. And after ali 

 these various changes, which required hundreds, and perhaps thousands of 

 years to accomplish, he views with his mind's eye the vast agency, the over- 

 whelming power, which doubtless convulsed the whole western continent, 

 contorting the crust of the earth, and upheaving our vast Apalachian 

 chain of mountains, extending from New York to Alabama, and at the same 

 time throwing the main strata into beautiful folds, or elongated anticlinal 

 roots. And finally, he contemplates the slow upheaval of the continent from 

 the bed of the primeval ocean â€” the subsidTnce of the waters â€” the quiescence 

 of the earth â€” and tlie various successive races of animals and plants, both 

 visible and microscopic, which preceded the present order of animated

existences. All this, doubtless, occurred, and probably in the order \ve 

 have mentioned ; since these animals sported in their native elements, basked 

 on the oozy shore of a river or an ocean, and left the vivid imprint of their 

 feet in its plastic mud. These are a few inferences from established data, 

 which give beauty to geology, interest to these foot marks, and which are 

 well calculated to impress the mind with sublime and stupendous concep- 

 tions. 



In another locality, about twelve miles distant, but in the same s)'nclinal 

 axis, on a slab of fine grained micaceous sandstone, which was taken from a 

 quarry about fifty feet beneath the rock already described, I found beautiful 

 imprints of hind and fore feet of an animal which I have ventured to refer to 

 the class MammaUa, and order Marsnpialia. The hind and fore feet 

 are obviously different. On the hind foot the toes are five ; on the fore foot 

 there are but four ; the plantar surface on the hind foot is long, narrow, and 

 terminates in a distinct heel: the fifth toe, whose imprint is faint, stands out 

 almost at a right angle with the foot, and much resembles the human thumb. 

 Indeed, the whole track does not look unlike the imprint of the human hand. 

 The length of the foot is five and a half inches ; the extreme spread of the 

 toes five and three-quarter inches; the interval between the toes is from one, 

 to one and a half inches ; length of the toes three inches. The fourth toe on 

 the fore foot stands out obliquely, like the fifth toe on the hind foot ; length 

 of toes two and a-quarter inches ; length of the foot four and a half inches ; 

 the extreme spread of the toes four and three-quarter inches ; the interval 

 between the toes from one to two inches ; the nails are quite distinct. At 

 the external side of all the tracks there is a protuberance, which resembles 

 the rudiment of another toe. The plantar surface is round and full, and 

 seems to indicate that the greatest weight of the animal was before; at all 

 events., the fore feet seem to have sunk more deeply into the plastic mud on 

 which these animals sported in the pristine ages of the world. The tracks 

 were in relief. 1 found but one that was in has relief. The fore and hind 

 foot follow each other very closely, there being an interval of only about two 

 inches between them. The length of the step was about twenty inches.* 

 I have given the average size of these truly remarkable tracks, but a few 

 were discovered, though not very distinct, at least two or three inches larger. 

 The slab was large, and contained tv%-elve or fourteen very vivid imprints, 

 together with many that were not so distinct. 



The discovery evidently conflicts with an hypothesis long since thrown 

 out, and still maintained by distinguished geologists, that the atmos- 



* The apparent shortness of the animal in proportion to the size, (for it 

 must have been large,) the sluggishness of its movements â€” which may be 

 inferred from the fact of the feet not tracking together, and the difference in 

 the number ot toes on fore and hind foot â€” seem to indicate an alliance with 

 the Batrackia. 




ISO [December, 1844. 



phere, during the carboniferous period, was essentially different from 

 what it is at present. It was supposed that it contained a much larger 

 amount of carbonic acid gas, which, by absorption, caused the rapid and 

 enormous growth of the coal plants. This could not have been, since we 

 now find that lung-breathing animals existed at the same epoch. 



The Reports of the Corresponding Secretary, of the Libra- 

 rian, and of the Treasurer of the Publication Committee, were 

 severally read and adopted. 



The Report of the Treasurer was read, and refeired to the 

 Auditors, 



The Recording Secretary read his Annual Report, which 

 was, on molion, referred to the Committee on Proceedings. 



REPORT 



OF THE RECORDING SECRETARY, 



For 1844. 



The original desisin in requiring i'rom the Recording Secretary of this Society 

 an annual Report of its transactions, maybe considered now as nearly super- 

 ceded by the plan adopted within the last few years of publishing its â€¢' Proceed- 

 ings " at short intervals. In addition to the various written and verbal commu- 

 nications made to the Society, this periodical contains extracts from the minutes 

 of all other matter which the committee, having charge of its publication, may 

 deem useful or important to be made known. 



Its pages may, therefore, be appealed to with confidence, for affording 

 abundant information to enable all who may cbooseto examine them, to form 

 an opinion of the character of its transactions, and of the degree of progress 

 which it has made in a twelve-month. 



The present report will, therefore, merely contain a short summary of the 

 contents of the Proceedings of the present year, together with a few additional 

 facts, not generally familiar to the members, and which may perhaps be inter- 

 esting to them. 



Perhaps, at no period since its organization, have the standing and prospects 

 of the Society afforded higher gratification to its members, than at present. 

 The cabinet has been enhanced in value and utility by an unusual amount of 

 contributions to its various departments, in some of which, in fact, should the 

 increase continue in the same ratio for a few years longer, there will be little or 

 nothing for the Institution to desire. New and neat ranges of cases have been 

 constructed within the last few months, for accommodating the large additions 

 of books and specimens. Every gallery is now occupied, and we have at 

 length the satisfaction of seeing the interior arrangements of this spacious and 

 commodious Hall completed in accordance with the design originally contem- 




December, 1S44.] ISI 



plated. For the accomplishment of these desirable objects, the Society is 

 indebted to the active efforts of the Curators, and other members. 



In number, variety, and aggregate value, the communications to the Society 

 in 1844, which have been published, will more than bear comparison with 

 those of any previous period, and furnish additional proof of the fact stated in 

 former reports, that this mode of publication is annnally increasing in impor- 

 tance and advantage to it, and is therefore eminently deserving of its continued 

 attention and care. 



The report of the Treasurer will show that some financial arrangements 

 have been effected by him during the year, materially benefitting the Society; 

 and that the efforts of this officer are still zealous and constant to secure to it 

 whatever advantages circumstances may place in his power. 



It is doubtless still within the recollection of most of those present, that the 

 long pending claim of the Society for $5,000 upon the heirs of an estate, 

 (being the amount of a mortgage upon the latter, presented to the Academy by 

 its late President, William ^laclure,) was settled in the course of last year by 

 a compromise between the parties, the Academy agreeing to accept from the 

 heirs, in payment of the claim, about $4,550, in Pennsylvania five per cent, 

 stock, at its original value. Mr. Alexander Maclure, desirous of carrying out 

 the wishes and intentions of his brother to the full extent, tendered to the 

 Academy, a few months since, the difference between the ori;:inal claim and 

 the amount accepted from the heirs. This sum, about Â§450, has been received, 

 and is now in the Treasury. The Academy owes its sincere thanks to this 

 gentleman, both for his promptness and the generous motives which influenced 

 him in this matter. The State stock still remains in the hands of the 

 Treasurer, under the hope, which recent circumstances have contributed to 

 strengthen, that its par value will ultimately be realized by the Academy. 



The donations to the Museum, in the different departments, have been 

 numerous and valuable, as has been already stated. 



Of the Mammalia, donations of skins and mounted specimens have been 

 received from Dr. Wra. Blanding, Dr. Reynell Coates, Oliver Evans, Esq., Mr. 

 Kilvington, and also a number in exchange. 



The contributions and additions to the Ornithological collection have been 

 remarkably numerous aud valuable. They have been derived chiefly from Mr. 

 Cassin, Dr. Watson, Dr. Blanding, the late Dr. Wesley Johnson, of Liberia, 

 Dr. Kane, U. S. N., Mr. Woodhouse and others. A number of fine bird skins 

 from Brazil, were purchased by subscription ; and recently, a large addition has 

 been obtained from Sweden, in exchange. 



The members are generally aware of the fact, that the Academy has pos- 

 sessed, for several years, a large and rapidly increasing collection of bird and 

 quadruped skins. Many of these were rare and valuable ; the gifts of corres- 

 pondents and friends of the Institution, to some of whom it has been at all 

 times indebted for contributions to its collections. With all the precautions 

 which may be taken, these skins cannot be entirely protected from injuries from 

 insects, dust, and other causes, and the Curators therefore promptly embraced 

 an opportunity, fortunately afforded a few months since, of employing a compe- 

 tent taxidermist, and upon such favorable terms, as to entrust to him the prepa- 




183 [December, IS44. 



ration and mounting of specimens of all such species as were not already 

 displayed in the Museum. This individual has now been employed regularly 

 up to the present time, and has accomplished a large amount of work in a very 

 short period, and with much satisfaction to the Curators and the Zoological 

 Committee. The whole number at present mounted and nearly ready to be 

 deposited in the cases, is 219. Of these 172 are birds, and the remainder 

 quadrupeds. 



So large an accession of mounted specimens to the Museum, necessarily 

 required additional accommodations, and accordingly a new and beautiful 

 range of cases is now being erected, occupying the entire length of the lower 

 gallery on the north side of the Hall. 



I have great pleasure in stating here, that the entire expense incurred in both 

 these improvements, has been defrayed by voluntary contributions from the 

 members alone â€” to some of whom the Academy is under especial obligations 

 on this occasion. In fact, the spiritof liberality which has always characterized 

 the members of this Institution, lias been equally displayed in this undertaking, 

 as in many others, having for their object real advantage to it, and permanent 

 utility. ^ 



Of Rcptile-i, Fishes, and Crustacea, donations have been made by Dr. Wat- 

 son, Dr. R. Coates, Capt. H. F. Baker, Wm. L. Bispham, Esp., J. Dundas, 

 Esq., Mr. J. G. Howard, Dr. Day, of Liberia, &c. 



The Entomological collection has received numerous additions during the 

 year. From the Rev. Dr. Thomas F. Savage of Africa, a number of very fine 

 insects of that country ; from Dr. Thos. B. Wilson of Delaware, a considerable 

 collection of very perfect American insects ; a collection of British Lepidoptera, 

 from Mr. Cassin ; and smaller donations from other individuals. By purchase and 

 exchange, there have also been obtained a very beautiful and numerous collec- 

 tion of Brazilian insects, a number of fine American Lepidoptera, and within 

 the past two weeks, about SOt) specimens of European Coleoptera. 



In the last report I stated that an effort was being made not only to improve and 

 increase the Entomological collection, but also to secure it, if possible, from the 

 constant injuries and losses to which it had been hitherto liaJDle. The plan 

 then proposed for the latter purpose has been since adopted, and there is every 

 reason, at present, to suppose that it will prove effectual. 



The interest already taken by the members in the improvement of this de- 

 partment has been such, that the number of specimens has rapidly increased 

 within a short period, and the collection promises to equal very soon, both in 

 size and value, any of those in the other departments. The whole of the 

 Coleoptera which it contains are now undergoing revision, and an arrangement 

 of the genera after the most modern system. The Academy is indebted, for 

 this advantage, to our fellow-member. Mr. Haldeman, who has voluntarily un- 

 dertaken this task, and upon whose known accuracy and intimate knowledge 

 of the subject the most implicit reliance can be placed. 



We would again beg leave to call the attention of the members and corres- 

 pondents of the Institution to this subject, and to request their further aid in 

 the present effort to improve an interesting department of the Society's cabinet. 



To the collection of Shells, the following are the principal donors during 

 the year : Mr. J. G. Anthony, of Ohio ; Rev. Dr. Savage, of Africa ; Mrs. 




December, 1S44.] 183 



Lucy W. Say, Mr. Peterson, Mr. Haldeman. and Dr. Gould of Boston. 

 Others have been derived from Dr. Mighels of Maine, Mr. Cassin, Dr. R. 

 C'oates, Capt. Baker ; and recently^ a very large accession has been made 

 through exchange. 



OC Fossils, the donations this year have been fewer than usual. A most 

 interesting one, however, was that by Gen. Irick, of Vincentown, N. J., of 

 the head of a fossil crocodile discovered in the vicinity of that place, and 

 which has formed the subject of a paper by Dr. Morton, who has regarded it 

 as new. Another donation of much value has recently been received from Dr. 

 Alfred T. King, of Westmoreland county, in this State, of fossils from the 

 carboniferous limestone of that region. 



The collection of Crania, possessed by Dr. Morton, has been increased 

 during the present year by many additions of great value and interest. This 

 collection is now of such extent as to require, for its display, the entire range 

 of cases on the south flying-gallery, which have been resigned to Dr. Morton 

 for this purpose. It numbers about 600 crania, derived from all the races of 

 man, ancient and modern, and G40 crania of the lower orders of animals, 

 forming an aggregate believed to be greater than is possessed by any other indi- 

 vidual living. 



Additions to the Zlineralogical cabinet have been made by Messrs. Ashmead, 

 Johnson, H. S. Stevens, Rice, Woouhouse, Kendal, Mease, Prof. Durbin, and 

 others. But the most important and valuable donation to this department during 

 the present, or perhaps any previous year, has been that of an entire suite of 

 the minerals of Cumberland, Durham, Westmoreland, and other counties of 

 England, by our fellow-member. Dr. Thomas B. Wilson. This beautiful 

 collection was obtained by this gentleman during his recent visit to that 

 country, and was presented to the Academy immediately upon his return home. 

 It has greatly enriched our Cabinet, and the donor well deserves and has re- 

 ceived the sincere thanks of the Society. 



In Botany, some donations of value have also been received. They are 

 chiefly from Dr. Englemann, of native Western plants ; from the late Dr. 

 Westley Johnson, of African plants ; and from Mr. Jacob Snyder, Jr., of this 

 city, of Alpine plants ; besides which, are smaller donations of fruits, seed 

 vessels, single specimens of plants, &c., from a number of contributors. 



The additions to the Library during the present year are as follows : 

 Folios, 4; Quartos, 26; Octavos, 16 ; Periodicals, (including Journals, Pro- 

 ceedings of Societies, &c.,^ 35 ; Publications in pamphlet form, 36 ; and Maps 

 and Charts, 4. Of the whole number, 46 have bsen received from authors and 

 editors, 27 from members, and 50 from Correspondents, Societies, &c., and 

 also in exchange. The average is about equal to that of late years. 



One of the new ranges of cases erected this season, to which reference has 

 been made at the commencement of this report, was for the use of the Library. 

 The rapid increase of the latter has required this addition for some time past, 

 a large number of volumes having been crov.^ded out of view, for want of room 

 in their appropriate places, and their existence in the library scarcely known to 

 the members. These have now been restored to their proper situations, and a 




IS4 [December, 1S44. 



more genera! distribution of the books has been made by the Library Committee. 

 Labels have been also placed over each case, indicating the nature ofits con- 

 tents, and indeed the whole arrangements of the Library, as now made, add 

 greatly to its facilities. 



In an Institution like ours, a Museum, however extensive and systematically 

 arranged, would obviously be of comparatively little advantage, without a cor- 

 responding Library of well selected works on subjects of Natural Science. 

 To render it entirely available, as few restrictions as possible should be placed 

 upon it ; and this has always been the object and aim of the Society. Access 

 to the books is at all times freely permitted to the members, and a large propor- 

 tion of them are allowed to be taken from the Hall. But experience has lately 

 proved that these privileges are not without some disadvantages. The Library 

 Committee, while engaged in the duty just mentioned, (of re-arrangement of 

 the books,) discovered that a considerable number were missing. Some of them 

 are works of much value, and which cannot easily be replaced ; and although 

 it is highly probable that many may be recovered through proper efforts, the fact 

 stated would seem to render it incumbent upon the Society to inquire, whether 

 the present regulations, if properly complied with by the members, are suffi- 

 cient for the security of the Library, or whether some further restrictions are 

 necessary. 



From a hasty examination of the Librarian's book of entries of additions to 

 the library, since the publication of the catalogue in 1836, the number may be 

 estimated at nearly 700, including all except maps and charts. If this number 

 be added to those stated in a report of the Library Committee accompanying 

 the catalogue, to be in the possession of the Academy at the above period, the 

 total now in the Library, including duplicates, would be little short of 8,000. 

 From this estimate, the collection of maps and charts, now numbering about 

 ."iOO, is excluded. 



Of the entire number of works in the Library, upwards of 1,500 are exclu- 

 sively on subjects of Natural Science, about 1,200 others are journals and 

 dictionaries, a large proportion of the contents of which are on similar subjects, 

 and are highly important and often indispensable as works of reference. 



Although, with such a collection of works at his command, the resources of 

 the student of natural history would seem to be ample enough, yet our Library 

 is greatly deficient in modern standard publications in almost every depart- 

 ment. Industrious and active laborers in the cause are now so numerous 

 throughout the world, and the field for investigation still so extensive, that 

 new discoveries are constantly made, new truths developed, and even ma- 

 terials for the formation of new systems collected. To enable our Library to 

 keep pace with the rapid progress of modern Science, it would be necessary for 

 a Library fund to be established â€” a measure which the Society has always had 

 in view â€” and placed in the hands of a competent committee, vviUing to under- 

 take the duty of impartially selecting from the numerous publications of the 

 day, such as would be of the greatest practical value to the Institution. 



This subject is not now referred to with the object of urging it upon the 

 Society, or even with the expectation of any action on it at present, as it in- 

 volves an expenditure which, at chis time cannot be incurred ; but it deserves 




December, 1844.] ^^^ 



to be always kept in view, and should engage the attention of the Society 

 whenever practicable, as the one now most important to its interests. 



The " Proceedings " are now so closely identified with the character of the 

 Society itself, that a brief sketch of the contents of those numbers which have 

 appeared during the year, can scarcely be omitted in an annual report. 



The support which this publication has received since it originated in 1841, 

 has been highly encouraging, and this has increased during the present year. 

 The second volume was commenced on the first of January last, since which 

 time five numbers have been issued, and the sixth is now in press, and nearly 

 ready for distribution. Together, these numbers will contain between ISO and 

 190 pages of matter, (much of which is in small type,) published in twelve 

 months. This proportion is larger than in any previous similar period since 

 this periodical was commenced by the Society. 



The first number contains a highly interesting letter from I. G. Strain, Esq., 

 U. S- N., one of the correspondents of the Institution. While at Rio Janiero, 

 towards the close of last year, awaiting the completion of his preparations for 

 making a hazardous journey of exploration into the interior of Brazil, he de- 

 voted a portion of his time to the translation of an important paper, which had 

 been communicated by Dr. Lund, of Copenhagen, to a Scientific Society 

 of Brazil, on the subject of some remarkable organic remains which the latter 

 had discovered in the calcareous rocks of that country. This translation was 

 obligingly furnished by Mr. Strain to the Academy, and was published in the 

 Proceedings soon after it was received. The information contained in Dr. 

 Lund's paper, of his discovery of human remains, in a state, to all appearance, 

 fossilized, is of great interest, and if verified by further developements of a 

 similar character, may tend to throw much light on a subject now attracting 

 great attention : the ancient history and physiology of the human race. 



The next communication is by Dr. Morton, being a description of the 

 cranium of a supposed new species of Hippopotamus, to which he has given 

 the name H. minor. The skull had been sent to Dr. Morton by Dr. Goheen 

 of Liberia, Africa, who himself believed it to belong to a species at present 

 unknown to naturalists, although the animal is by no means uncommon in the 

 river St. Pauls, from the banks of which he had obtained the specimens which 

 Dr. Morton possesses. 



A large portion of the succeeding number is occupied by papers describing 

 new species of N. American Coleoptera, from Dr. Melsheimer, and the Rev. 

 Mr. Zeigler, of Pennsylvania ; and from Mr. John L. Le Conte, of New York. 

 Dr. M.'s paper, which is long, and includes a large number of species, has been 

 drawn up with great care, and evinces a closeness of observation, and a 

 minuteness of investigation, which are rarely exceeded by those devoted to the 

 study of Entomology. The communications of the two other gentlemen 

 named, are not equaf in length, but they are likewise entitled to great credit. 



In the third number will be found a paper, by Dr. Hallowell, describing new 

 African reptiles. This paper, and another published in the fifth number, will 

 serve to maintain the reputation which the author enjoys, of being a cautious 

 and accurate describer, especially of objects in this department of Natural 

 History. 



Dr. Morton has communicated another paper in the fourth number, describing 




1S6 [December, 1844. 



a very interesting fossil, the nearly perfect head of a crocodile, already alluded 

 to, from the Cretaceous strata of New Jersey. To this relic Dr. Morton has 

 given the specific name of Clavirostris, and closes his paper with a list of all 

 the organic remains hitherto discovered in the same strata. 



In the fifth number there is a letter to Professor Espy from several of his 

 friends in this State, in which some facts are stated tending to corroborate 

 his theory that rain may be artificially produced in time of drought. This 

 number also contains a description of some new organic remains from the 

 Eocene of South Carolina by Dr. Ravenel, of Charleston ; a portion of 

 another voluminous paper on N. A. Coleoptera, by Dr. Melsheimer ; the 

 paper by Dr. Hallowell 'already referred to; an analysis of sulphur springs 

 in the State of New York by Professor Reid, of the N. Y. College of Pharma- 

 cy ; and some interesting observations by Dr. Morton, on a new series of 

 Ancient Egyptian Crania which he had recently received, the characters of 

 which he has been gratified to find fully bear him out in his results previ- 

 ously obtained from the larger collection which form the materials of his 

 Crania Egyptiaca. 



In addition to the different written communications which have been thus 

 hastily noticed, there are a number of others in a verbal form which have 

 been offered before the Society during the j'ear ; chiefly from Prof. Johnson 

 and Dr. Morton. The former has given some further results of his exten- 

 sive researches and experiments upon the habitudes and properties of coals 

 of this and other countries, and has greatly added to otir knowledge of their 

 comparative value for the purposes of fuel and the arts. 



Betv.'eenthe 1st of December, 1843, and the 1st of the present month, the 

 Society has elected eight new members, and eleven correspondents. Ten of 

 the latter are residents in the Uniteil States, and one is foreign. 



And here the present Report might be closed. But it would appear to be 

 doing injustice to the memory of two of our late fellow members â€” Dr. 

 Marmaduke Burrough, and Nathan Dunn â€” were I to omit the opportunity 

 here afforded me of devoting a few words to a notice of each. 



The former, as is well known to all present, passed abroad the greater 

 part of the active period of his life, and during his extensive travels, never 

 failed to acquaint himself with the natural productions of the various coun- 

 tries which he visited. His collections were made less for himself, than for 

 the purpose of affording gratification to his numerous friends, and of enrich- 

 ing the cabinets of those Institutions with which he was connected. But 

 none received so abundant a share of these treasures as the Academy. There 

 is scarcely a department of the museum which will not amply attest this 

 fact. The name of Dr. Burrough is associated with many recollections 

 of benefits conferred on this Institution, and his loss will ever be deplored 

 by her as that of one of her warmest supporters, and most disinterested and 

 active friends. 



From the executors of the late Nathan Dunn we have learned, with min- 

 gled feelings of pleasure and regret, that his will contains a bequest to this 

 Institution of $10,000, but that in consequence of circumstances which need 




December, 1844.] 1S7 



not be referred to here, there is but little probability that the intentions ot 

 the testator can be complied with. 



The possession of this sum would not only render the Academy indepen- 

 dent, but it would be also enabled thereby to carry out several favorite 

 projects which have been long contemplated. Whether this bequest be 

 realised or not, however, the Academy is equally bound to record its gratitude 

 for this unexpected instance of noble liberality towards it, and also for the 

 unequivocal evidence which it affords of the testator's approval of the objects 

 for which this Institution was founded. 



All which is respectfully submitted by

Mr. Haldeman exhibited specimens of the male and female, 

 and of the larva and pupa of Corydalus cornutus, and made 

 some remarks upon its habits and structure. The larva is 

 aquatic, but leaves the water and constructs a cavity beneath 

 a stone, in which it changes. The prothorax is much larger 

 in the larva than in the pupa and imago. The mandible 

 and labrum are prominent at all stages; the antennae very 

 small in the larva, and situated at the external base of the 

 mandibles. The male of the perfect insect is known by the 

 large arcuate mandibles, and both sexes present the re- 

 markable peculiarity of a vertical perforation through the 

 head, at the anterior base of the antennae.

The Chairman read a letter from Mr. Richard K. Haight, 

 dated Paris, 6th November, 1S44, acknowledging the receipt 

 of his notice of election as a Correspondent, and in reference 

 10 Mr. Panthier's work above mentioned. 



Dr. Morton also read the following extracts from a letter 

 addressed to him as President of the Academy, by Dr 

 Richard Lepsius, the distinguished head of the Prussian sci- 

 entific commission in Egypt, dated Island of Philge, 15th 

 Sept., 1844. 



" It will interest you, perhaps, to read the summary of the 

 communications made by me to Mr. John Pickerino^, of Boston, 

 President of the American Oriental Society of that city. They 

 give some of the results of our journey into Ethiopia, and espe- 

 cially in regard to the ancient population of Meroe, their lan- 

 guage, their descendants, and their relation to Egypt, â€” showing 

 that the Meroites were a people of a red complexion, and that 

 they spoke the language of the Bishariba [Bisharrees?] of the 

 present day, which is decidedly Caucasian, and very rich in gram- 

 matical forms, and important on account of the place it occupies 

 among the other Caucasian languages. 



But another remarkable fact which presents itself to us in 

 Ethiopia, may perhaps have a more immediate bearing on the ob- 

 ject of your Society. In the province of Butir-el-Hagar, at a 

 lono^day's journey above Wady-Halfa, and near the cataract of 

 Semneh, the Nile is contracted between high rocks which ap- 

 proach each other within a distance of three hundred and eighty 

 feet; and on these yet remain the foundations of two very ancient 

 fortresses, erected by the conqueror of the country, Sesourtasen 

 III., (Osortasen,) the fifth king of the twelfth dynasty^ and not of 

 the XVIIth dynasty, as hitherto supposed. 



Upon the enormous blocks constituting these structures, as 

 as upon the rocks themselves, I have found a series of 

 eighteen hieroglyphical inscriptions, of which thirteen belong to 

 the reign of the immediate successor of Osortasen, viz., Amen- 

 enha III., the Mceris of the Greeks, the same who built the pyra. 

 raids and excavated the lake of the Fayoum, as recently discovered 

 by M. Linant. The other five descriptions belong to the last 

 king of the Xllth Dynasty, Amenenha IV., and to the first two 




194 [January, 1845 



kings of the XIITth Dynasty. All these incriptions, which em- 

 brace a period of nearly fifty years, have no other object than to 

 mjrk the height to which the river rose in the several years of 

 which they bear the date. Independently of the novelty of these 

 inscriptions, which are very short, they possess a great value 

 in enabling us to compare the ancient elevations of the waters of 

 the Nile with those of our own time ; for the oldest of these re- 

 cords dates back to a period of twenty-two hundred years before 

 the Christian era. Thus, the measurements I have made with the 

 greatest care, and which at this place were taken with compara- 

 tive facility, on account of the vertical position of the impending 

 rocks, have given the remarkable result that the average rise 

 of the Nile four thousand years ago, was seven metres, thirty 

 cent, (or about twenty four English feet) higher than it is at the 

 present day. 



It will be readily conceived that this great difference in the 

 level of the river, must have had an important influence upon the 

 soil above the cataracts- and it directly explains a fact that had 

 previously surprised me, viz : that in all the valley of Nubia, the 

 level of the soil upon both shores, although it consists entirely of 

 alluvium deposited by the Nile, is much more elevated than the 

 highest level of the river in the best year of modern inundation â€¢ 

 for the whole country has now to be irrigated by hydraulic ma- 

 chines called Sakie. 



The cataract of Semneh could never have influenced the height 

 of the river between Wody-Halfa and Assouan ; but we may sup- 

 pose that the cataract of Assouan was in ancient times much 

 more closed than at present ; because we observe the same eleva- 

 tion of the soil in this part of the valley ; [between the first and 

 second cataracts.] The mean elevation of the soil above the mean 

 height of the river, is here (Philce) somewhere from three to 

 four metres, (from 10 i to 16 i feet.) But this same country 

 still presents the traces of a much more ancient state, beyond the 

 record of history, when the granite mountains which separated 

 Ethiopia from Egypt obstructed the passage of the river, and 

 formed real lakes in some localities ; as for instance, in the gullies 

 or gulfs between the rocks in the Arabian chain, wherein we ob- 

 serve hillocks of Nile earth which rise ordinarily even to ten and 

 eleven metres (thirty-four to thirty-seven feet) above the level 

 the highest modern inundation. 




January, 1845.] ' 195 



In reference to the preceding facts, it may perhaps be interesting 

 to the members of your Society to examine some specimens of the 

 different layers of the earth of the Nile, and I have accordingly 

 sent, in a tin case, the following examples : 



1. Earth ofthe Nile, taken from the summit of hillocks at 

 thirty feet above the present level of the river, upon its eastern 

 bank, half an hour (about a mile) above Korosco, [nearly sixty 

 miles above Assouan.] 



2. Some ofthe present soil of the valley of Korosco, taken at 

 a height of three feet above the Nile. 



3. Specimen ofthe earth newly deposited at Korosco, the l8th 

 of August, 1844. 



4. A little sand taken from the thermal spring at Okme, on 

 the southern frontier of the Province of Butir-el-Hagar, which is 

 the only spring of the kind, to my knowledge, in all the valley of 

 the Nile. It is on the western bank of the river, and issues 

 from the earth at a temperature of 44 deg. Reaum." (130 Fahr.) 



The following extract from another letter from Dr. Lepsius, 

 of the same date, addressed to Mr. Gliddon, was also read by 

 the Chairman. 



" We shall leave this (the Island of Philce) in a few days, and 

 hope to arrive at Thebes in a month. We shall remain there 

 during the winter, and shall return during the spring through Syria, 

 Asia Minor, Constantinople and Greece, to our fatherland, where 

 we shall arrive in the course of the next summer."

202 [February, 1845. 



The Committee to whom was referred a coraraunication by 

 Prof. Johnson, read at the meeting of the 11th inst., reported 

 in favor of pubUcation. 



Prof. Johnson first enumerates some of the methods which have been 

 hitherto employed by Chemists and others, to ascertain the relative heating 

 powers of fuel. 



1. The heating of waUr, without converting it into vapour, is practised first 

 by Rumford, and more recently by other experimenters, particularly by Des- 

 pretz and Dulong. The French chemists assume as the united calorific power, 

 1 gram of water heated 1Â° centigrade, (1. "^SFahr.) The number of such units 

 produced by burning 1 gram of combustible is termed its calorific efficitncy. 



2. The melting of ice, as in the calorimeter of Lavoisier and Laplace, also 

 employed by Hassenfratz. The heat of fluidity, (135o Fahr.) is here the 

 measure of effect. 



3. The heating of air, or maintaining a certain distance between an interior 

 room in which combustion is conducted, and an exterior one, kept cool by 

 the open air. The length of time such difference is maintained by a given 

 weight of each fuel, is the measure of its efficiency. This is the method of 

 Mr. Marcus Bull. 



4. Comhustion in. contact with metallic oxides, â€” measuring the heating 

 power by the weight of metal, reduced on the supposition that the latter is 

 proportionate to the weight of oxygen withdrawn. This is illustrated by 

 M. Berthier's process by litharge. 



5. The reduction of the nitrate or chlorate of potash to the state of a carbo- 

 nate, by fusing these salts, and then graduallya dding the combustible, till 

 complete saturation has taken place. 



6. The practice of the Coriiish engineers, of measuring the efficiency of 

 fuel by the weight of water, which a given bulk of it (as 1 bushel) will raise 

 one foot high, when burned under a boiler driving a pumping engine. 



7. The distillation of the coals to ascertain the weight affixed carbo7i 

 which they contain, suggested by the experiments of Mr. Pfyfe, of Edinburgh; 

 the weight of that constituent being supposed to measure the head or power. 



8. Ultimate analysis , which assumes that the quantity of heat developed 

 by an organic combustible, depends on the heating power of the carbon which 

 it contains, added to that of its excess of hydrogen, above what is required 

 to combine with its oxygen in forming water. This method has been applied 

 by Messrs. Peterson and Schoedler to wood, and by Richardson, Regnault 

 and others, to coals. 



9. The direct or practical trial by evaporation, as practised by Messrs. 

 Parkes, Wicksteed, Pfyfe, Schanfhautl and Manby in Great Britain, by 

 Messrs. S. L. Dana, A. A. Hayes, J. A. Francis, and more recently by 

 Prof. J. himself, in this country. (The results of the trial last referred to 

 are contained in the Report to the Navy Department on American coals re" 

 c?ntly published by Congress.) 



10. The melting of iron either in a reverberatory or a cupola furnace, the 

 weight of metal fused by one part of combustible being the standard of com- 

 parison. 




February, 1845.] 203 



11. The perfonnance jf smith's work of a uniform character, such as the 

 manufacturing of chains by means of the several varieties of fuel. The num. 

 ber of links of chain formed by a given weight of each coal, is here the 

 measure of useful effect. 



'J"he object of the present communication is mainly to exhibit the relation 

 between the results obtained by the eighth, and those by the ninth method 

 of trial above mentioned. 



The existence, in bituminous coals, of variable proportions of nearly pure 

 charcoal, is referred to as furnishing evidence of a want of homogeneousness 

 in this class of bodies. A diversity of results may consequently be expected 

 when ultimate analysis is resorted to for the purpose of establishing a theory 

 of transmutations, or of demonstrating what changes have occurred in bring- 

 ing vegetable substances into the state of bituminous coal. Those who 

 assume uiondy fibre as the sole basis from which it has been derived, do not 

 pretend to prove that the other proximate constituents of vegetables, the re- 

 sinous matter, for example, and the oily component of seeds, have been 

 wholly removed. Hence analyses of coal applied to this purpose may not 

 always lead to unobjectionable inferences. But as means of determining 

 the calorific power of combustible bodies, they may, especially when per- 

 formed on average samples, or multiple specimens, afTord information both 

 interesting to science and valuable to the arts. 



The relation between the calorific power calculated from analysis, and the 

 practical heating power decided by evaporating water, is determined for six 

 different varieties of bituminous coals, varying considerably in their com- 

 position. 



Drawings of the apparatus employed for both these purposes were ex- 

 hibited, and their action explained. That used in evaporation is so con- 

 structed as to determine the proportion of heat expended on the products of 

 combustion, as well as that employed to generate steam. 



In applying calculations to the ultimate analyses of coals as well as to the 

 products of combustion, the atomic weight of carbon is assumed to be six, 

 of oxygen eight, and of nitrogen fourteen times that of hydrogen, in accord- 

 ance with the recent determinations of Dumas. In calculating evaporative 

 powers, the latent heat of steam is taken at 1030Â° Fahr., according to Prof. 

 J.'s own investigations of that subject. 



In ascertaining the relative efficiencies and values of combustible bodies, 

 with a view to economical applications, it is necessary to take them either as 

 found in nature, or as supplied in commerce, including, of course, whatever 

 impurities they may chance to contain. But in order to deduce general re- 

 lations between bodies differently constituted, in regard particularly to their 

 combustible constituents, the comparison must be made after deducting the 

 waste, or incombustible matter found in the crude state of the fuel. This 

 principle is applied both to the ultimate analysis and to the evaporative ex- 

 periments; and hence in the following table both the calculated evaporative 

 power of the carbon comtiluent, (column 15,) and the total evaporative 

 efficiency by experiment (column 18,) are referred to, and calculated for, one 

 part by weight oi combustible matter. 



The relation between the fixed and the volatile combustible matters of 




204 [February, 1845. 



coais, is liable to considerable variation, accoriling to the rate of distillation 

 to which they are subjected. The nnore slowly this process is conducted, 

 the higher (within certain limits) will be the proportion of fixed carbon.* 

 'J'he estimation of heating powers, therefore, from the quantity of fixed car- 

 bon which coals contain, if not wholly erroneous in principle, must be liable 

 to considerable uncertainty in practice. 



Many highly bituminous coals contain more than 5 per cent, of materials 

 convertible into ammoniacal liquor by simple distillation without contact of 

 air. This is proved on tho largest scale in the manufacture of illuminating 

 gas. That proportion, therefore, is not only unavailable for heating purpo- 

 ses, but it also abstracts from the really combustible materials of the I'uel. 

 all the heat, sensible and latent, which the vaporized ammoniacal products 

 receive during combustion. 



The proper water nj combustion, namely, that derived from the hydrogen 

 in excess, and oxygen of the atmosphere, must in every instance where heat 

 is applied to evaporate water above the boiling point, as in all ordinary 

 steam boilers, be likewise incapable of giving up its latent, as well as much 

 of its sensible heat. 



The average specific gravity of the six varieties of bituminous coals assay- 

 ed is 1.31, â€” that of water at 60Â° being unity. Admitting the hydrogen in 

 its solid state to have a density of only 1.25, it must in passing into the 

 state, first of gaseous hydrogen, and then into that of watery vapour, (still 

 having the same bulk as the hydrogen,) undergo an enlargement to 2117 

 times its original bulk. This volume is farther increased according to the 

 usual law of gaseous expansion, by whatever heat above boiling point is left 

 in the vapour, when it passes away from the surface to be heated. In a well 

 constructed evaporative apparatus producing steam of 6 pounds pressure, in 

 which the circuit traversed by the gases afterl passing the grate, and before 

 reaching the chimney, was 121 feet, the temperature was generally about 

 100Â° above the boiling point; and the watery vapour, being of course sur- 

 charged with heat, possessed 2431 times the bulk which it had in the solid 

 state and at 60 degrees of temperature. 



By the experiments of Dulong, (Comptes Rendus, tom. 7,t) one gram of 

 pure carbon developes, in burning, heat enough to raise the temperature cf 

 7170 grams of water, 1Â° centigrade, or 12906 grams 1Â° Fahrenheit. This 

 latter number is, therefore, used as a co-efficient, by which to multiply the 

 numbers in the 12th column of the following table to obtain those of the 

 15th. By the same authority, 1 gram of gaseous hydrogen gives heat suffi- 

 cient to raise 62,535 grams of water 1Â° Fah. 



The average excess of hydrogen for the six varieties of coal tried by eva- 

 poration, as deduced from columns 13 and 14 of the table, is 4.636 per cent, 

 which, calculated after the manner of the European chemists, ought to pos- 

 sess an evaporative power of 2.814. This would raise the average of the 

 15th column from 10.700 to 13.514, as the calculated evaporative power of 

 the unit of combustible matter, showing the calculated to be 26.3 per cent, 

 higher than the experimental effect.

The data furnished by the preceding table afford the means of ascertain- 

 ing the proportion of its carbon volatilized in the distillation of the combus- 

 tible matter in each kind of coal. 



The calculations prove that of its whole carbon constituent, the per cent- 

 age volatized was as follows : 



Cambria county coal, .... 16767 



Midlothian, new shaft, 

 New Castle, â€¢ 

 Clover Hill, . 

 Scotch Cannel, 

 Caseyville, Ky., Cannel, 



29.195 

 15.967 

 1(5.847 

 24.169 

 22.452 



And that the average was 20.883 



The identity of results obtained in the averages of the 15th and 18th 

 columns would seem to demonstrate that the heating power of bituminous 

 coals is proportionable to the carbon which they severally contain. 



The Monthly Report of the Corresponding Secretary was 

 read and adopted. 



John L. Le Conte, M. D., of New York, and M. Clot Bey, 

 M. D., Surgeon in Chief to the Viceroy of Egypt, were 

 elected Correspondents of the Academy.

Specimen of a true concretionary Oolite rock ; from the south

A communication from Mr. Haldeman was read, dajed 

 Chiquesalunga, March 3d, 1845, suggesting to the Society an 

 exchange of publications with the " Swiss General Association 

 of Naturalists." 



A paper by Dr. Hallowell, entitled "Description of Rep- 

 tiles from South America, supposed to be new ;" and a 

 second paper, entitled " Descriptions of new species of African 

 Reptiles," were read and referred to the following committee, 

 â€¢viz. : Dr. Blanding, Rev. Mr. McFarland, and Dr. Hol- 

 brook. 



Professor Johnson made some remarks on a recent occurrence 

 of the adhesion and apparently perfect cementation of two steel 

 bars in the cold state, while revolving in contact with each other. 

 The one, the upright shaft, bearing a heavy mill stone, and the 

 other a cylinder of the same diameter, also standing vertical, and 

 on the head of which the shaft was supported. Both bars were 

 of the same diameter, (rather more than an inch) and their ends 

 were planes running in contact. The mill being suddenly arrest- 

 ed and the two bars found strongly united, eflforts to separate 

 them proved ineffectual, and the attempt led to a fracture out of 

 the original juncture. 



This occurrence was stated to be in accordance with observa- 

 tions already familiar to those who have studied the phenome- 

 na of cohesion, and particularly the habitudes of steel and iron, 

 when subjected to mechanical motions tending to modify the con- 

 dition of their ultimate molecules. 



The simple pressing together at ordinary temperatures of two 

 clean and plain surfaces of lead causes them to cohere with much 

 tenacity. Two or more portions of the same metal at an elevat- 

 ed temperature, issuing under pressure from a reservoir of semi- 

 fluid metal, may unite under simple pressure to form a continuous 

 tube, so perfect, that it will part at any other section as soon 

 as at the line. of juncture. Two disks, of glass, perfectly clean, 

 and placed in contact without the intervention of air or of organic 




210 [March, 1S45, 



matter, cohere to an extent far beyond what the mere external 

 pressure of the air would be adequate to produce. 



Besides the tendency of similar materials to cohere when 

 brought into close contiguity, the two bars had the farther advan- 

 tage of developing in each other a very high degree of magnetism. 

 This, their vertical position alone, without motion, being so near 

 the direction of the magnetic dip, would certainly in time pro- 

 duce; and with the revolving motion, which (as every machinist 

 knows from the operations of boring and drilling) produces a high 

 magnetic state, it would occur with much greater promptitude and 

 intensity. 



It was represented that the juncture had not apparently been 

 heated, at least not discolored. This latter fact is perfectly con- 

 sistent, however, with such a degree of temperature as would allow 

 much mobility of particles, and greatly aid the high pressure of 

 more than a ton weight per square inch, and a strong magnetic 

 attraction to bring the revolving surfaces into the sphere of actual 

 cohesion. The grease box with which the two bars are stated to 

 have been surrounded would defend the surfaces from oxidation, 

 the cause of discoloring, and would interpose no effectual pre- 

 ventive against the contact of two plain surfaces, revolving in the 

 circumstances now supposed. 



Professor Johnson referred to his own experiments, made many 

 years ago, in which it was found that bars of iron broken at a tem- 

 perature of 5 or 600 degrees, and in the magnetic meridian, be- 

 came strongly and permanently magnetic. He referred to the 

 Proceedings of the Academy (vol. 1, page 144,) for an account of 

 the phenomena then observed. 



It is a subject of regret that the proprietors of the mill in ques- 

 tion bad not preserved the united bars, to be submitted to compe- 

 tent persons for a minute examination of their condition and pro- 

 perties. 



Prof. Henry D. Rogers stated that the specimen of OoUte 

 rock presented by him this evening, had been obtained from 

 Dr. Binney of Boston. It had been found in Florida, in a 

 somewhat extensive deposit, by a correspondent of that gen- 

 tleman. Though identical in color and structure with the 




March, 1S45.] 211 



Bath Oolite of England, its organic remains would seenn to 

 refer it to tlie latest tertiary period. 



On motion of Dr. Bridges: Resolved, Thiat the Committee 

 of publication be authorised to transmit to the " Swiss General 

 Association of Naturalists," an entire set of the Journal of the 

 Academy, and a copy of the Proceedings as far as published.

Description of a oiew Vulture in the Museum of the Academy of Naturai 

 Sciences of Philadelphia^ 



By John Cassin. 



Genus Cathartes, Illiger. 



C. Burrovianus. 5 C. capite nudo, laBvi, naribus magnis, ovatis, cor- 

 pore otnnino nigro, viridi-ccerulescente subnitldo, subtus pallidiore ; plutnis 

 extendentibus sursum super posteriore cervicis, parvo spatio in pectore nudo. 

 Alls longis, remigibus et rectricibus nigris, scapis primarum albis et conspi- 

 cuis, tertia prima longissima. Haec species est minima vulturum American- 

 orum cognitorum. 



Long. tot. (exuvii) 22 unc, rostri 2\, alae IS, caudae 8i. 



Hah Prope Vera Cruz. 



Head naked, smooth, with the nostrils large and oval ; plumage of the body 

 entirely black, with a greenish blue gloss, paler beneath; the feathers ex- 

 tend upwards on the back of the neck, a small bare space on the breast. 

 Wings long, the quills and tail feathers black, with the shafts of tlie prima- 

 ries white and conspicuous, third primary longest. The smallest American 

 Vulture known. 



Total length (of skin) 22 inches, bill 2J, wing 18, tail 8i. 



Hah. â€” Near Vera Cruz. 



This species resembles C. anra^ Linn., in the shape of the bill and nostrils, 

 and in having the tail rounded, but differs from it not only in size, but the 

 feathers extend upwards on the back of the neck and lie flat instead of form- 

 ing a ruff; the plumage of the specimen now described is black, none of the 

 feathers having pale margins, as is commonly the case in specimens of C. 

 aura ; the shafts of the primaries are clear white, and the head is more en- 

 tirely destitute of downy feathers. The tarsi are longer and more slender. 



The head oi C Burrovianus is quite smooth, in which, as in other respects, 

 it is very different from C. atratus, Wilson. 



This new species was obtained in the vicinity of Vera Cruz, by the late 

 M. Burrough, M. D., in honor of whom 1 have named it, as a slight acknow- 

 ledgement for his very valuable services to Natural History and to this Aca- 

 demy.

 middle, thence to the apex suddenly rounded; deeply, densely and rather 

 equally punctulate ; anterior edge [liceous ; hind angles subacute, slightly ex- 

 curved, carinate, carinas parallel to the outer edge : scutel densely punctulate,

 9 1. Jong; 3il. wide. Pennsylvania. 



Densely rugose ; head and thorax black, minutely and confluently wrinkled 

 and punctured, densely clothed with yellowish pile, the latter with an obtuse 

 indentation on the middle of the anterior margin and the obsolete one in front 

 of the scutel ; between the two indentations is a faint medial line ; lamellae of 

 Xhe ayitemia dusky rufous; elytra dusky rufous, finely and densely wrinkled: 

 the three ordinary raised lines not strongly defined ; beneath and feet black ; 

 postpectus densely clothed with yellowish hairs. This species bears a very 

 strong resemblance to S. niger, Kn., but it differs from that species in being 

 always more robust, and in having the elytra differently colored, and always 

 differently and more obsoletely sculptured. The elytra are scarcely punctured 

 inriibidus, hnt m ni^er Xhej VLte obviously and profoundly punctured. But 

 as only male specimens of rubidiis have yet been found, it may still prove to 

 be oaly a male variety of ?i45-er. Is not mhidiis T[ieTha.ps Rkipicera rufpetuiis 

 of Dejean's Catalogue ? 



2. S. brevicollis. Black, punctured ; thorax short and round at the sides.

Robust, oblong, black ; head opaque, densely and finely rugose-punctured, 

 with the frontal lateral edges more than usually elevated above the insertion of 

 the antennae : thorax more than twice shorter than long, w'ider at base than 

 at apex, widest behind the middle, with the sides rounded; densely and 

 minutely punctured and wrinkled, densely clothed with an ashy pubescence ; 

 a large triangular indentation on the middle of the anterior margin, and a 

 similar but less profoundly indented one in front of the scutel; medial groove 

 distinct between the two indentations : elytra opaque, with the ordinary lines 

 distinct, spaces with irregular series of large, profound and approximate punc- 

 tures ; vesture indistinct ; beneath and/eei black, finely and densely punctured,' 

 and clothed as above ; tarsi piceous. Resembles in the thorax S. petrophya^ 

 Kn., but in the general colour and outlines and sculpture of the elytra it differs 

 essentially from the same.

Black, densely clothed with a fine, short pile : head finely and densely sha- 

 sreened ; chjpeits truncate at apex ; lahriim narrow, transverse ; palpi fili- 

 form, ternninal joint acute at tip ; antenncR inserted before theeyes, nearly half 

 the length of the body, fuscous, pubescent, sometimes the two first joints dull 

 testaceous, joints compressed, basal joint clavate, second small, subglobose, 

 third and fourth almost equal, the former very slightly longer than the latter : 

 thorax convex, comparatively narrower before and wider behind than'in cervina, 

 Fabr., dull rosaceous, with a large suboval black spot each side of the middle ; 

 medial line obsolete, with a small impression in front of the saitel, which is 

 suborbiculate or cordate, color of the^thorax; elytra slightly convex, feebly 

 contracted behind the shoulders ; punctate-striate, interstices flat, confluently 

 and minutely transversely corrugated : lateral edges, suture, and two or three 

 longitudinal bands, ashy, they are somewhat obsolete except when viewed in a 

 lateral oblique direction : feet and beneath, dull blackish, ashy sericeous ; tarsi 

 almost simple, basal joint subclavate, the three following ones slightly dilated, 

 hardly cordate ; claws very minutely ciliated or pectinated. In consequence of 

 the second and third antennal joints of this coleoptera being almost equal, and 

 the tarsal joints simple and not cordate, it cannot strictly be placed in the genus 

 Atopa, but it certainly approaches, in other characters, nearer to it than to any 

 other genus. This species feeds exclusively on the Alder.

A letter was read from Dr. Edmund Ravenel, dated

 ing particulars respecting the geological position of certain 

 strata of that State, and indicating some new localities which 

 he had discovered for Eocene and Miocene fossils. 



A comminiication was read from the Directors of the 

 " Museum d'Hisioire Natnrelle" at Paris, dated 1st March, 

 1845, acknowledging the reception of certain Nos. of the 

 Proceedings, and requesting the transmission of others wiiich 

 the Association had failed to receive. 



Dr. Morton then proceeded to make some ohservations on 

 the three himian crania deposited hy him this evening, hut 

 more particularly in reference to that of the Congo nearo, 

 whicli Wcis presented to liim by Dr. David Gilbert, of Get- 

 tysburg, in this State, 



This skull pertained to an indivi<lual who could not have been 

 more than twenty years old ; and yet there is a total absence of 

 the sagittal and coronal sutures, and the lamdoidal itself is not 

 complete, while the temporal suture remains entirely open. 

 Dr. Morton called the attention of the society to a communication 

 made by him in 1841, on a skull in nearly all respects analogous 

 to the present one, and the opinion then deduced from it, viz.: 

 that the principal function of the sutures is to subserve the growth 

 of bones, which they do by osseous deposition at their margins; 




May, 1845.] 233 



hence a suture in the cranium is equivalent to the epiphysis be- 

 tween the shaft and head of any one of the long bones.* In the 

 present example, Dr. 3Iorton showed that owing to the total ab- 

 sence of the sagittal suture, the lateral growth of the cranium has 

 ceased at an early period of life ; the presence of the lamdoidal 

 suture has permitted uf posterior eldugalion, and the squamous 

 sutures being entirely open, the upward gri)Wth, corresponding to 

 the lines of these sutures, is remarkably developed. 



Dr. Morton expressed his acknowledgments to the Baron Von 

 Gerolt, Prussian Minister at Washington, for the ancient Mexican 

 cranium deposited this evening. It was exhumed from the ce- 

 metery of San Juan de Tlatilolco, near the city of Mexico, in 

 wliich were buried great numbers of the Mexicans who were 

 slain in defence of their city against the Spaniards, during the in- 

 vasion of Cortez.

To Professor Henry D, Rogers, Samtiel George Morton, M. D., and Pro- 

 fessor IVa/ler R. Johnson, Committee of the Academy of Natural Sciences 

 of Philadelphia. 



Gentlemen, â€” A plain statement of such facts as I have been able to collect 

 in reference to the Gfoloi;ical character of the country bordering on the Mis- 

 souri River, will perhaps be preferable to attempting a detailed reply to the 

 questions pr' posed by your Committee to Mr. Audubon and myself on our de- 

 parture for the upper waters of the Missouri in the spring of 1843. 1 would 

 beg leave to remark that our opportunities for Geological research fell far short 

 of our anticipations. The extent of our journey was unexpectedly limited to 

 the mouth of the Yellowstone, and just before leaving that place, a diagram, 

 which I had formed of the strata in the hills rising baclc of Fort Union, was un- 

 fortunately destroyed when too late to replace it. The specimens taken from 

 these strata will be found in the box which I have sent to the Academy. Our 

 opportunities in descending the river were also far from being favorable. Fre- 

 quent storms and high winds obliged us to lie by in places which we would not 

 have chosen lor any of the purposes of the expedition, so that by taking advan- 

 tage of all the good weather to hasten our progress, we were only able to reach 

 St. I.ouis in our Mackinaw boat on the sixty-third day from Fort Union. 



In the whole course of the Missouri, from its mouth to the mouth of the Yel- 

 lowstone, the strata are horizontal, and as we passed up the River, I noted the 

 points at which each of the principal series was lost under the water by the 

 rise in the bed of the stream. Thus â€” the lower series of secondary limestone 

 disappears a few miles above Bellevuc, and at Cabaue's Bluff, twenty miles fur- 

 ther, a ledge of rocks crosses the river beneath the water, causing a slight rapid 

 at a low stage water. I take this to be the last evidence of that formation. 

 From Cabaue's Bluff to the Grand Sioux River, a distance of about 160 miles, 

 the River approaches the Bluffs in but few places, and in those places the rock, 

 of about 60 feet in thickness, appeared to be a soft sandstone. (In no part of 

 this formation had we an opportunity of landing to ascertain the nature of the 

 rock, still I thought we were near enough to pronounce it sandstone.) This 

 stratum loses itself in the River near the Grand Sioux. At this place a stratum 

 of soft clay stone appears, which runs to within a few miles of the lower end 

 of the Great Bend where there is another submerged ledge of rocks crossing; 

 the river. Then we have Nicollet's great bed of clay, which is visible until you 

 pass the Mandans, terminating between Beaver anil Grand Rivers. Here com- 

 tnences what I have called the Yellowstone series, which probably continues to 

 the great Falls of the Missouri, or until it is met by the outcropping rocks of the 

 mountain range, if these Falls be not formed by such outcropping. 



Thus we have in the ascending series â€” No. 1, The secondary limestone 

 from the first Bluff on the Mississippi, above the mouth of the Ohio, to Cabaue's 

 Bluff on the Missouri, ten or twelve miles below Old Council Bluffs. No. 2, 

 Yellow sandstone (?) to Grand Sioux River. No. 3, Clay stone to lower end 

 of Great Bend. No. 4, Nicollet's clay to a point between Beaver and Grand 

 Rivers. No. 5, The Yellow stoneformation. It will be perceived that the loca- 




236 [May, 1845. 



lities named as the ending of one and beginning of another series, are not in 

 fact the beginning of the upper bed, but are the points where the superior stra- 

 tum of the last series is lost sight of in the River. Hence it is evident (fronn 

 the fact of the strata being perlectly horizontal) that while the lower series will 

 never be seen higher up the river than the points indicated, the superincumbent 

 series must have ii s beginning many miles lower down, according to the height 

 of the Bluffs and the angle of descent of the stream. 



Whenever we ascended the Bluffs to the High Prairies, we found them more 

 or less covered with a Boulder drift, with frequent denuded points, leaving the 

 larger Boulders lying upon the regular strata. As we ascended the River, the 

 Boulders, which are much worn and rounded, increased in size (with some vari- 

 ations) until we reached the high hills of the second Great Bend, between the 

 Mandans and the mouth of the Yellowsione, say, from the size of paving stones 

 at Fort Croghan to rocks of several tons at the second Great Bend, after which, 

 and at thu Yellowstone, half a ton would probably be the size of the largest 

 Boulder. 



The exceptions to perfectly horizontal stratification are only found in series 

 No. 4, and appear to have arisen from two causes â€” from slides of the h luffs, 

 and from the fact of their frequently taking fire and burning for several years, 

 causing the B'uds to i-inc ;ind crumble down. Mr. Bell was the only one of 

 our party who had an opportunity of witnessing the burning of the cliffs, while 

 on a hunting excursion about 30 miles above the Yellowstone on the northern 

 bank of the Missouri. Smoke was issuing from the summit of the cliffs under 

 which he was riding â€” there was a thin seam of coal on a line with the smoking 

 part of the cliff, but where it was burning, and where the fire appeared (by the 

 crumbling down of the clift) to have passed, there was no coal visible. I am 

 inclined, from this circumstance, and from having found remains of coal in a 

 stratum of sandstone containing impressions of leaves, and bearing evident 

 marks of iire, to think with Lewis and Clark, that the burning of the cliffs is to 

 be attributed to the spontaneous ignition of the coal. The soil in No. 4 and 5 is 

 strongly impregnated with salts, apparently sulphate of magnesia (?) so that 

 most of tl.e brooks and springs are saliferous. In excursions on the Prairies it 

 is difficult to find good water. Soon after rains it may be found in smnll basins, 

 but these soon become brackish, unless they are in the detritus of the drift. 



Series Nos. 3 and 4 appear to contain the greatest quantity of crystallized salts, 

 such as alum, copperas and sulphate of magnesia, and saliferous springs and 

 streams in great numbers. Warm springs are said to exist, but we did not meet 

 with them. We found a substance like petroleum in color and consistence, but 

 without odor. Crystallized gypsum ? (see specimens) is exceedingly abundant 

 in No. 4, lying in thin veins, cutting the regular stratification at right angles. 

 Fossil shells abounded most in No. 4. 



In No. 5 commence the remarkable strata which form the picturesque hills 

 noticed by travellers, and called thi^ Mauvaises Terre- by the trappers and voy- 

 ageurs. The strata vary from a few inches to a few feet in depth, and from the 

 variety of their colors, and from the singular forms and grouping of the hills 

 into which the great Bluff of the high Prairie is gullied by the torrents of ages, 




May, 1845.] 237 



they appear in many places more like the work of art than nature. They are 

 usually called Clay hills by travellers, but repeated inspection has satisfied me 

 that clay occupies but a small number of the strata, at least in the vicinity of 

 Fort Union. There are strata of sand, clay, shale, sandstone and coal alternat- 

 ing, but without regularity. I have frequently seen a stratum of sand com- 

 pletely covered by the washing from a superincumbent stratum of clay, like a 

 coat of paint, so that its nature could only be ascertained by scraping off the 

 thin covering; of clay. I am inclined to think, however, that the proportion of 

 clay is greater in the lower strata of this series, immediately overlying the Nicol- 

 let clay. The cause of the singular castellated appearance of these hills is the 

 great variety of materials of which the strata are composed being acted upon in 

 various degrees by atmospherical influences, according to their capability of re 

 sisting them ; hence the spires, pyramids, cones and other forms cutout by the- 

 torrenls, are frequently capped by hard sandstone, while the stratum, immediately 

 underlying it, may be sand or clay, which being more easily affected by the 

 atmosphere, crumbles away and leaves the sandstone projecting, and soon with 

 thirty or forty distinct strata of hard and soft sandstone, sand, clay, sh.ile and 

 coal, of very marked shades of color, and in many places reddened by the 

 action of fire. I should have remarked that the vi-^ible coal seams which com- 

 mence in the upper part of No. 4, are most abundant soon after entering into 

 No. 5, and become small and few in number about the Yellowstone. I counted 

 in one place ei^ht seams of coal between the river bank and the top of the Bluff, 

 varying from six inches to four feet in thickness. This coal is very light, and 

 ignites with difliculty. emitting a very unpleasant odor while burning. Fossil- 

 ized wood is very abundant in No. 5 ; I saw one specimen very much flattened 

 by the pressure of overlying strata. Small beds of limestone are found at Fort 

 Union. 



In regard to the evidences of volcanic matter overlyinsj the stratified rocks on 

 the borders of the Missouri, and of the existenc-' of red purnice in such situa- 

 tions, I have no where been able to discover them, alihou<;h I sought them dili- 

 gently in my frequent excursions into the Mauvaises Terres. The red appear- 

 ance of the shal^" and clay, and in many instances of the sandstone, is, I believe, 

 to be attributed to the action of fire, but may be more read;ly accounted for 

 from the effects of the spontaneous combustion of the coal going on at the pre- 

 sent day, than froin volcanic agency. These evidences of fire occur in so many 

 of the strata at such different levels, that to give them the latter oiigin we are 

 compelled to suppose a succession of eruptions, but in this case what has become 

 of the tuffa and lava ? It is impossible that I coulil have tailed in discovering 

 some evidences of their existence. Still I do not pretend to deny that the pumice 

 which is so Irequetitly found flodted down the Missouri, may have had its origin 

 in these hills, and may have been found there hy Mr. Catlin ; (I do deny that it 

 is the cause of the red appearance of the hills) but may it not be accounted for 

 by the action of these spontaneous fires ? May itot pumice be found without 

 volcanic action ? Some of the specimens of sandstone with impressions of 

 leaves, in the box sent to the Academy, are evidently changed in their specific 

 gravity by the action of fire, and your Committee will be better able than my- 




238 [May, 1845. 



self to judge, whether an increase of the heat, short of that necessary to produce 

 vitrification, may not have converted the mass into the red pumice of the 

 Missouri. 



In a bed of soft sandstone at the mouth of Cannon Bali River, great numbers 

 of those singular stones are found, which give name to the stream. The fol- 

 lovs^ing remarks from my Journal, made on the passage up the River, were 

 fully confirmed when we stopped at the mouth of Cannon Ball River on our 

 return : *' June 6 â€” On passing the mouth of Cannon Ball River yesterday, we 

 noticed a remarkable formation in this stratum " (soft sandstone) " of round 

 masses of rock " (hard sandstone) " in the divisions of the strata, many of them 

 apparently perfectly spherical, and from 18 to 30 inches in diameter, some as 

 perfect as cast balls, others appear to be flattened or composed of two sections of 

 a sphere, from a smaller ace up to a hemisphere, joined together with mathema- 

 tical nicety, and surrounded by a belt or zone at the junction, projecting from 

 one to four inches, which zone lies horizontally in the line of division of two 

 strata. I had observed traces of this peculiarity in the rock the day before, and 

 this evening, 30 miles below the Mandans, I noticed it again. Cannon Ball 

 River takes its name from the presence of these balls. Thev are said to be 

 hollow, and to contain crystals." The last remark was not confirmed by the 

 opening of two large specimens brouiht home by Mr. Audubon, which were 

 found to be solid and of uniform texture throughout. 



A somewhat analogous formation occurs in the region of the Yellowstone. 

 It consists of a similar hard sandstone, lying also in the direction of the strata 

 of soft sandstone, but in form like a flattened trunk of a tree swelling out at the 

 root, and might be taken for fossilized wood, but that it is destitute of concen- 

 tric rings, and laminae can always be traced in the direction of the longest dia- 

 meter of the elliptical end, sometimes in exact correspondence with, and in 

 other instances lying obliquely to. that diameter. I have seen them in situ 

 projecting ten feet horizontally and perpendicular to the face of the cliff. I 

 have seen others of more than twenty feet in length lying at the foot of the 

 cliff whence they had fallen. The smaller end always exhibits the appear- 

 ance of a transverse fracture with edges sharp and well defined, the larger 

 end rounded and resembling the head of an immense bone fitted to work in 

 a socket. 



If this meagre statempnt of facts and the few specimens which accompany 

 it, will serve in a small degree for the better appreciation of the Geological 

 character of this interesting region, and hold out any inducement to well qua- 

 lified persons to undertake its investigation, the object of the undersigned will 

 be accomplished. 



Yours Respectfully, 



Edward Harris. 




May, 1845.] 239 



The Committee to whom the above paper of Mr. Harris, 

 on certain points in the geology of the Upper Missouri, was 

 referred, having availed themselves of additional information 

 from that gentleman, and examined the specimens brought 

 home by him, submitted to the Academy the following facts 

 and inferences in the form of an appendix to his valuable 

 communication. 



Of the Red Pumice of the Missouri. 



Upon the question of the origin of this singular substance, the Committee 

 desire to express their general concurrence in the views presented in the paper 

 of Mr. Harris. From the evidence afforded by the series of specimens, it is 

 clear that the so-called Pumice is not a true volcanic product, but is originally 

 an argillaceous sandstone, probably a lacustrine deposition of a tertiary age. 

 In its altered, cellular form, it is said to occur loose on the shore, throughout 

 nearly the vehole length of the River, as if strewed by the freshets, its specific 

 gravity being frequently less than that of water. 



The locality, where it was seen in place, is between the Beaver and Grand 

 Rivers, above the Mandans, on the East sideof the Missouri, and therefore about 

 200 miles below the mouth of the Yellowstone. Here the material offers the 

 most unequivocal marks of being derived from the spontaneous combustion of a 

 sedimentary argillo-arenaceous stratum. The rock is seen in almost every state 

 of gradation from a stratified mass containing beautifully distinct impressions 

 of leaves of terrestrial trees, to a light vesicular pumice. Certain half-fused 

 specimens show indeed the well preserved traces of these leaves, the partially 

 melted condition and the nearly perfect vesicular structure, all upon the same 

 mass. The presence of sulphuret of iron, and of lignite, in the neighboring clays 

 of the same group of strata, suggests a ready source for this spontaneous 

 combustion. 



This explanation of the origin of the pumice, sustained as it is by the draw- 

 ings and descriptions of the scenery given by the Prince Maximilian, and borne 

 out by the fact that no other material, of even an imputed volcanic source, has 

 ever been discovered in the plains of the Missouri, renders it highly probable 

 that the stratified pumice, alleged by Mr. Catlin to exist there, is derived from 

 the same cause. We therefore come to the general conclusion, which best 

 accords with all that is known of the topographical features of the region, that 

 no trace of volcanic action is visible East of the Rocky Mountains. 



The leaves imbedded in the stratum which produces the pumice-like material, 

 bear a near resemblance to those of the common beach tree, (Fagusferruginea,) 

 they are at all events the leaves of an exogenous tree of a recent type. 



Proofs of a Freshwater formation^ near the Mouth of the Yellowstone River. 



In the immediate vicinity of Fort Union, near the junction of the YelJow- 

 stone and Missouri Rivers, in the group of strata designated as No. 5 in Mr. 

 Harris's paper, occur incontestible proofs of a freshwater formation. At a dis- 



29 




210 [May, 1S45. 



tance from the Fort of about half-a-mile, that gentleman had a view of the 

 horizontal outcrop of the lands of rock thro'jgh a height of about 80 feet, com- 

 mencing 80 or 100 feet above the river, and terminating more than 100 feet be- 

 low the general level of the rolling plains, which are here nearly 300 above the 

 bed of the Missouri. The section which he constructed was subsequently lost. 

 It exhibited 15 different beds of alternating soft clays, uncemented sands, and 

 soft argillaceous sandstone. 



In the upper part of this section occurs lignite, some of which is in the com- 

 dition of a ver)- friable charcoal. 



The fourth and fifth layers in this section are especially interesting. The 

 4th is a bed of clay, the 5th a layer not more than one foot in thickness, of a 

 brown ferruginous araillaceous rock. They contain three or four species of 

 freshwater univalve shells, Lymnea, Planorbis, &c. One of the species of 

 Planorbis it is conjectured may be a form now extinct, but the mutilated con- 

 dition of the specimens prohibits a positive opinion. 



Within one mile and-a-half of the locality of the section just alluded to, there 

 is a stratum of fine-grained argillaceous sandstone of a light-grey colour, with 

 minute black specks. This occupies a higher level than the top of the section. 

 The rock is exposed in a quarry through a thickness of 20 or 30 feet, whence 

 building stone has been procured for the foundations of the fort. Like the beds 

 previously described, this stratum furnishes proofof a freshwater origin. Among 

 the specimens from it, is one presenting the two valves of a bivalve shell, appa- 

 rently an Anadovta ? 



It also contains leaves of deciduous trees, bearing a close resemblance to those 

 of the Beach. Besides these indications we have evidences derived from the 

 remains of what was probably a mammiferous animal. Two fragments of bone 

 procured at one of the above localities, indicate by their cancellated structure an 

 animal of this type; but they were too imperfect to enable us to decide the 

 order to which they belong. 



The proofs thus afforded of a probably widely diffused freshwater formation 

 in the region of the Upper Missouri, reposing upon the cretaceous strata, and 

 jmbedJmg remains of a manifestly tertiary age, are just at this time invested 

 v.itli considerable interest, from their according with the discoveries recently 

 mide bv Criptain Fremont, of the presence of other and probably extensive 

 freshwater tertiary strata in the Oregon Territory. 



AH which your Committee beg leave respectfully to Report.

 might be taken ; it differs from it, however, in the form of the head, which is 

 much more' depressed, and in the arrangement and form of its plates ; the tail 

 also is much shorter.

This species resembles very much our C. functatus, but wants the spots 

 upon the abdomen. The latter, however, are occasionally absent in the pttne- 

 tatus ; it may, therefore, notwithstanding the remoteness of its habitat, very 

 possibly be the same species. It would appear to be common, four specimens 

 having been observed in the collection.

The specimens above described were found in the Republic of Columbia, 

 within two hundred miles of Caraccas. As far as I have been able to ascertain 

 they are new, with the exception of the Coluber atratus, and the Trigonoce- 

 phalus Colomhiensis, both of which are somewhat doubtful ; the latter resem- 

 bles very much the plate of the lajiceolatus, as given in the Regne Animal of 

 Cuvier, except that the triangular spots upon the sides meet upon the back, 

 whereas, in our specimens â€” of which there were two â€” they are distinct. It 

 differs from it also, as above stated, in the number of the abdominal and sub- 

 caudal plates. Among them was a specimen of the Amphisbaena fuUgi7iosa, 

 They were all preserved in spirits.

For the opportunity of describing this and the preceding species, I am in- 

 debted to the kindness of my friend Dr. Blanding, whose services in the 

 illustration of the Zoology of this country and of Africa are well known. 

 The specimens were preserved in spirits, and the colours have no doubt 

 more or less changed. Among them was a horned snake, which appears to 

 be the Coluber nasicomis of Shaw, but his description is imperfect, and his 

 figure incorrect; I would propose for it the name Cerastes nasicomis.

Description of the Teeth of a neiv Fossil Animal found in the Green Sand of 

 South Carolina. 



By RoKERT VV. Gibbes, M. D., of Columbia, S. C. 



DoRUDON SEERATUS. 



Teeth spear-shaped, serrated, indistinct deep sockets with double fangs, the 

 bifurcation commencing a half inch below the enamel, which extends from the 

 point of the tooth one inch; enamel striated ; the serrse longitudinal, diminish- 

 ing in size from the apex of the tooth, which is | of an inch from the first la- 

 teral point ; length of the tooth 3i inches ; breadth 2^ inches ; thickness of ihe 

 body below the enamel a Aa// inch; the anterior root a cone compressed 

 laterally, the other prismatic, thicker on the posterior side, which is fluted 

 so as to present the appearance of being partially divided into two fangs. 

 When tha fangs are united the neck is contracted, so that a horizontal section 

 presents the yoke shape of the tooth' of the Zeuglodon of Owen ; in one of the 

 teeth the distance from the extremities of the fangs across is 2^ inches. 



The teeth and fragments of a maxillary bone here described, were found in 

 March last, in a bed of Green sand near the Santee Canal, in South Carolina. 

 The locality is on the plantation of R. W. Mazyck, Esq., about three miles 

 from the entrance of the canal from the head waters of Cooper river. The de- 

 posite of Green sand is from four to eight feet near the surface, lying on a 

 solid yellowish limestone containing casts of Cardita Planicosta, (Sow.,) and 

 Pecten Mortoni, (Ravenel,) which, according to the opinions of Lyell and 

 Conrad, would refer it to the Eocene period. Casts of C. planicosta are found 

 in the Green sand, which seems, therefore, to belonstotbe Tertiary formation. 

 Conrad makes the following remarks, in his conr.munication on " the Tertiary " 

 addressed to the National Institution. 



" In many localities of the former period (tertiary,) the green sand is quite 

 as abundant as in the fossiliferous ' marls' o( New Jersey." In this deposite is 

 found, in great abundance, Gryphaa, Tnutahilis, also Pecten memhranosus, 

 P. ealvatus, Scutella erustuloides, S. Rogersii, Solarium ? , Plagiostoma gre-

 Crocodiles, and of several species of Squalns ; casts of C- â€¢planicosta, and of a 

 Terebratida. Mr. Tuomey, the Geological Surveyor of South Carolina, found 

 also, at this locality, a new Ostrea and a large Lima. Here also was found a 

 singular fossil, of a conical shape, 15 inches long, fluted externally, somewhat 

 resembling a Belemnite, of which a drawing and description have been for- 

 warded to the Academy of Natural Sciences by Dr. E. Ravenel, of Charleston, 

 South Carolina. 



About two miles from this locality a very compact white limestone is found, 

 with grains of silicate of iron intermingled with portions of it, containing 

 Ostrea sellceformis, O. panda, Terebratida lacryma, Scutella crustidoides, 

 casts of Turritella Mortoni, Conns gyratus, Anthofhyllum, atlanticum, Flus- 

 tra? casts of the chambers of a Nautilus, Crustacea, a Spatavgns, Cidaris? 

 &c. &c. Here also Mr. Tuomey has discovered another new Ostrea. This 

 list of fossils is made out from recollection, and without the specimens before 

 me. 



With these teeth I have a part of a lower maxilla, containing portions of 

 teeth, 20 inches in length, hollow, filled with the gree7i sand. It re- 

 sembles much the elongated beak of the GariÂ«/, but is too imperfect to describe 

 more accurately. 



A portion of the anterior partof this jaw contains a cuspidatus, resembling 

 that of the Megalosaurus, a single fang, with the protruding crown and point 

 curved but not serrated; it is compressed laterally, and placed obliquely in a 

 socket. 



These teeth are all hollov:, filled with the green sand which surrounds them. 

 They differ materially from any genus or species described by Ctjvier, Owen, 

 Ma.ntell, Buckland, Harlan, Morton, or Hays. A strong resemblance 

 exists, in the form of the elongated snout, to the Gavials, while the hollow 

 teeth, characteristic oi Saurians, differ from them in being seated in sockets, 

 and having two roots. 



Mantell, treating of the teeth of Reptiles, says: 



" The characteristic type is that of a conical pointed tooth with a simple root 

 or fang ; for in no reptile does the base of the tooth terminate in more than one 

 fang, and this is never branched." 



Owen, in his Odontography, (p. 25,) observes : 



" Any fossil which exhibits a tooth implanted by two fangs in a double 

 socket must be mammiferous, since the socketed teeth of reptiles have but a 

 single fang, and the only fishes' teeth which approach such a tooth are those 

 with a bifurcate base belonging to certain sharks." 



I observe that Professor Owen has classed the Zeuglodon (^Basilosattrus of 

 Harlan,) with the Cetacea, I am inclined to think the Dorudon, which 1 here 

 name, (from <f5,:y, a spear,) will, on farther investigation, be found to belong 

 to the same class. 



I visited the locality where it was found, but the marling operations of the 

 planters had ceased for the season, and the pits were filled with water. I have 

 made arrangements for excavations in the fall, when I hope to procure other 

 bones of this remarkable fossil. It may then be possible to decide with more 

 authority as to its position in the great scale of extinct gigantic carnivora.

256 [Juke, 1845. 



Since the above communication was written, I have visited Albany, and 

 through the politeness of Professor Emmons, had an opportunity of examining 

 the teeth of the Zeuglodon cetoides, (Owen.) I was much struck with the 

 similarity in their general characters with those of the Dorudon. They are 

 very much of the same form, but the crown rounded instead of hastate â€” the 

 serratures are similar, though more crenate- The fangs of some are inserted 

 almost perpendicularly, while in others they are divergent, and fixed in the 

 sockets as in the Dorudon. The teeth of the Zeuglodon are solid, of dense 

 structure, and very strong, resembling those of Cetacea, while the hollovjness of 

 those of the Dorudon approximate it to the Saurians. The jaw of the Zeuglo- 

 doti is much shorter, and proportionally thicker. The conformation being 

 similar, while the specific characters of these teeth separate them, I am disposed 

 to think that the Dorudon is an intermediate connecting link between these 

 two great classes. 



Professor Emmons is about to publish correct drawings of the teeth of the 

 Zeuglodo?!,, which Professor Owen has not given, from having imperfect speci- 

 mens. '

 collection of European fossils, belonging to Mr. R. C. Taylor, 




Aug., 1845.] 261 



which the Society, by a late resolution had authorized them 

 to receive on deposit, was now in the Hall. 



The Chairman, after making some general remarks on Mr. 

 Taylor's cabinet of fossils deposited this evening, read the follow- 

 ing abstract of its contents, from a printed circular, which was 

 issued by Mr. Taylor, and which will serve to convey some idea 

 of their extent and value. 



The collection is designed to illustrate the principal English 

 formations. The specimens were selected by Mr. Taylor with great 

 care from their respective localities, during a period of 25 years, 

 commencing in 1805; and although since they have subsequently 

 been subjected to frequent removals from place to place, &c., very 

 few have sustained injury. The greater portion is fixed on 

 blocks covered with paper of different colors. Labels attached 

 to the foot of each block, exhibit the generic and specific name 

 of each fossil, arranged according to Sowerby's Mineral Concho- 

 logy, and referring to the tables or figures in that work. 



In Geological arrangement, the collection commences with the 

 English Diluvium, so called, and proceeds downwards, by sec- 

 tions, from the most recent deposit to the oldest, which contains 

 organic remains. In conchological classification, the Univalves, 

 Bivalves, and compound shells, are separated in distinct drawers, 

 and reference to any individual or species is further facilitated 

 under this arrangement, by an alphabetical nomenclature. 



The collection has been repeatedly subjected to examination 

 by English professors and Naturalists of celebrity, and their aid 

 obtained in doubtful cases. 



The entire number now contained in the collection, amounts 

 probably to about 4000, all arranged in the mode already men- 

 tioned, in drawers with sliding glass covers, accurately fitted, and 

 a label in the front of each, indicating the formation to which the 

 specimens contained in it belong. 



On motion of Mr. Cassin : Resolved, That the cordial thanks 

 of this Society be presented to Richard C. Taylor, Esq., for 

 his liberality in making the Academy the depository of his mag-

By William Gambel. 



Family LEPTOSTOillDiE. 



Bill longer than the head, straight except towards the tip ; wings short, 

 rounded; tail long, cuneated ; feet with two toes before and two behind ; tar- 

 sus long and stout. 



Genus Leptostoma, Swains. 



Bill long, stout, entire ; straight, except at tip which is hooked ; triangular 

 at base, compressed towards the tip. Nostrils lateral, naked, oblong. A wide 

 bare space extending from the eye to the nape. Wings very short, rounded. 

 Tail very long, cuneated. Feathers around the base of the bill rigid, the 

 shafts elongated into black setaceous hairs ; the upper eyelid also with a 

 row of very rigid hairs. Feathers of the body very long and woolly ; those 

 of the breast, shoulders, wings and tail beautifully variegated, and with 

 long ciliated edging. Tarsus very long and stout, crested.

 CYX viaiicus ? Wagler, Lichtenstein. 



Male. â€”Variegated; feathers of the back part of the head erectile into a crest 

 one and a quarter inches in height, which is steel blue with purplish retlec- 

 tions. Upper part of back and wings, upper tail coverts and two middle 

 tail feathers, brownish green with bronze reflections, those of the former with 

 steel-blue, ochraceous, and white ciliated edgings ; those of the latter 

 principally with white. Front of the head, sides of the neck and breast, with 

 the centres of the feathers still blue, broadly margined with ochraceous and 

 white. Tail cuneated, of ten feathers, and nearly twelve inches in length, 

 the two outer ones about three inches shorter than the two middle ones, and 

 all except these latter bluish-green, narrowly edged and tipped with white- 

 Body covered with very long silky or woolly feathers ; above of a blackish 

 gray color, below of a grayish white, with a tinge of yellowish-brown, par- 

 ticularly about the thighs and vent. A bare space extending from the eye 

 to the back of the head on each side, where it opens out into a round patch 

 of a Vermillion color. Wings very much rounded, first quill two-thirds the 

 length of the fourth to the tenth, which are nearly equal^ the rest of the 

 secondaries scarcely shorter. Primaries and secondaries dark brown, edged

with white at their tips, and with a band of narrow white spots on their 

 outer margin some distance above their tips. Throat greyish-white, with 

 a dusky line on each side. Bill dark horn color. Feet and legs very stout, 

 the former beneath very scabrous. Tarsus bluish-white. 



Length 21 J inches. Tail nearly 12, tarsus 2J, longest toe and nail If. Bill 

 along the ridge nearly 2 inches, depth at base J an inch. "Wing from 

 flexure about 7 inches. 



This extraordinary bird, evidently the connecting link between the scan- 

 sorial and rasorial order of birds, was first noticed by Swainson, from a spe- 

 cimen brought from Mexico by Mr. Bullock ; and who gave it the above name, 

 though for many years it remained undescribed in the collection of the Zoo- 

 logical Society from not being able to get access to it. In the Natural His- 

 tory of Birds, Mr. Swainson describes the genus and gives also the specific 

 name by which he had distinguished it in 1824 in the catalogue of Bullock's 

 Museum. It was afterwards perhaps described by French as Saurothera 

 Bottce, Blainville ; and S. Californiana, Lesson ; but if they mean the same 

 bird, the description is so inaccurate as to be scarcely recognizable, the 

 locality alone making us suppose it to be the same. 



It is found in all the northern provinces of Mexico, where it is called 

 Paisano. In California it is not uncommon, and called in some parts of it 

 Chur^a^ and in others Correcamino, the astonishing swiftness with which it 

 runs making it well known wherever it inhabits. 



Family PROMEROPIDJE. 



Genus *HARPES.f 



Bill longer than the head, arched from base, depressed ; upper mandible 

 broad and flattened with the margins very sharp ; lower, narrower and some- 

 what shorter. Nostrils basal, open, rounded. A tuft of hairs at base of 

 upper mandible. Wings short and much rounded. Tail long, cuneated. 

 Feet and legs long and stout. Tongue short and flat. Colors plain. 



Harpes *redwiva. Promerops de la Californie Septentriouale, La Pe- 

 rouse. Atlas to voyages, plate No. ST. 



Glossy brown above ; beneath from lower part of breast ochraceous, ap- 

 proaching to rufous on the vent and lower tail coverts. Throat greyish 

 white, lower part of neck, breast and sides brownish, somewhat lighter than 

 that of the back. A dusky line runs along the side of the throat from the base 

 of lower mandible. Ears large and open, auriculars loose and somewhat 

 rigid, the shafts white, with the sparse hairy webs, dusky. A dirty white 

 line over the eye. Tail 5^ inches in length, cuneiform ; beneath tinged with 

 the fulvous color of belly, and with traces of narrow dusky bars throughout 

 its whole extent ; two outer feathers about an inch shorter than middle ones. 



Wings short and rounded ; extent of both 12 J in., each from flexure 4 in- 

 1st primary about half the length of the 3d, which is shorter than 7th, 8th 

 and 9th ; 4tb, 5th and 6th equal and longest. Tarsus 1 J in.; hind toe and nail, 

 which is curved, 1 in., the nail being about as long as the toe. Total length 



f From 'A/>TÂ», a sickle, hook or bill. 




Aug., 1845.] 265 



12 inches. Bill black, along ridge 1 and 5-8th inche3,inner surface of upper 

 mandible almost flat, the edges sharp and projecting; each mandible triago- 

 nal ; the lower narrower than the upper. Eyes projecting. Irids hazel. 



This curious bird was first seen by the naturalists in La Perouse's expe- 

 dition, as he tells us, who considered it a Promerops ; and he merely remarks 

 on it, " we killed and prepared a Promerops which most ornithologists be- 

 lieve peculiar to the ancient continent,'' and gives no further description 

 of it. 



The figure given in plate No. 37 of the Atlas is very inaccurate in every 

 respect, except as regards size ; the tail of the bird is not so graduated and 

 tipped as in the figure, and although the breast alone is showed, the broad 

 pectoral band and white throat is not given : the black line over the eye 

 also is incorrect ; however, it is nearly as good as the figure of the Califor- 

 nian Quail. 



No further account of this bird (as far as I can learn) has been given since 

 the time of La Perouse until now, and it is rather singular that so many 

 travellers should have passed through the country it inhabits without find- 

 ing it, from which I infer its rarity even there. Both specimens which I have 

 seen were shot on the ground, near Monterey, in Upper California. 



Veilliot and Lotham also mention this bird, merely quoting La Perouse's 

 words, of course giving neither name or description. 



Parus, Linn. 



Parus *inornaius. Male. â€” Crested : above olive brown ; beneath greyish 

 white, with a slight tinge of brownish on the flanks. Front close to bill, 

 round the eye and ears grizzled grey. Crest high and pointed like that of 

 the p. bicolor. Bill and feet leaden-blue, the former very stout and blunt. 

 Wings and tail dark-brown, the feathers edged with the same colour as the 

 back ; some of the primaries also with a faint edging of whitish. Irids 

 wood-brown. 1st primary half the length of the 2d ; 4th, 5th and 6th equal. 

 Extent of wings a little over 8 inches. Wing from flexure 2| inches. Tail 

 nearly even 2i inches. Total length of inches. 



Upper California, common â€” frequenting the evergreen oaks in company 

 with the other western species. 



Parus *fasciatus. Male. â€” Feathers of the head elongated, erectile into a 

 crest ; head greyish brown, inclining to bluish grey on the cheeks and sides 

 of the neck. Back, rump, margins of wing and tail feathers olive brown. 

 Beneath pale rufous, slightly mingled with bluish grey about the throat and 

 breast, and with brownish about the flanks and vent. Wings and tail dusky 

 brown, the latter distinctly barred throughout with a darker colour, having 

 from 20 to 25 bars, the quill feathers also barred in the same manner on 

 their inner webs. Bill and feet dark horn colour. Feathers between nostrils 

 and eye whitish. Wings short and rounded. 1st quill an inch shorter 

 than 5th, 6th and Tth, which are longest. 3d shorter than 9th to 12th, from 

 flexure 2^ inches. Tail very long, cuneated, 3^ inches in length, two outer 

 feathers IJ inches shorter than middle ones. Tarsus long and slender, 1 

 inch. Total length about 5 inches, extent of wings the same. 



This very distinct species, after having once discovered, I found to be quite 




266 [Aug., 1845. 



common in California, frequenting the bushy margins of streams and weedy 

 places, with the intermediate habits of a titmouse and wren ; both of which 

 in some respects it resembles. For the present I place it in the Genus 

 Parus, but think its bill and other peculiarities render it worthy of being 

 separated from it. 



The bars on the tail and wings in some specimens are more indistinct 

 than in others. 



Mergulus, Ray. 



yi ERGV Lvs, *Cassinii.f Head, back, wings and tail deep glossy black; 

 breast, belly, vent, spot above and below the eyelids white ; throat, neck 

 and sides greyish black or plumbeous, the feathers of the scapulars, lower 

 part of back and rump tinged with the same. Bill larger and stouter than 

 that of the M. alle, and with a yellowish white spot or Ijand across the 

 base of lower mandible ; wings without any white in them. Front part of 

 feet and legs sky-blue, behind black. 



Length to end of tail 1\ inches. Tarsus 1 inch. Bill nearly f of an inch. 



This new species frequent along the coast of California ; may readily be 

 distinguished from the M. alle, which it resembles, by the absence of any 

 white in the wing; the size of the bill ; and as it turns in the dried speci- 

 men, the orange spot at base of lower mandible ; and by the sides being 

 coloured like the throat. , 



Further notices of the character and habits of these birds I hope to give 

 in a future paper, containing a list, with remarks on the birds which I ob- 

 served in Upper California.

Tachinus, Gravenh. 



T. puncticollis. Chestnut-brown; thorax with two punctiform impres. 

 sions on the middle near the basal margin ; elytra yellowish testaceous- 

 Length 4 lines ; breadth 1| lines. 



Head dark chestnut brown. Antennae, four basal joints rufo- testaceous ; 

 remaining joints fuscous, excepting the terminal one which is dull-yellow- 

 ish at tip. Clypeus and palpi rufo-testaceous. Labrum pale yellowish. 

 Thorax, at base slightly narrower than the base of the elytra, transverse, 

 base subrectilinear, sides rounded and marginate, angles obtusely rounded, 

 anterior ones deflexed ; two punctiform impressions on the middle near 

 the basal margin, between which is an abbreviated longitudinal impressed 

 line ; dark chestnut-brown ; highly polished. Scutellum rather small, im- 

 punctured, somewhat dusky. Elytra punctured ; yellowish-testaceous, 

 with the lateral edges and suture posteriorly, and the apical margin dusky. 

 Pectus and feet, dull yellowish-rufous. Abdomen punctured, dark chest- 

 nut-brown. Inhabits Pennsylvania. 



Somewhat like T. crassus, Gravenh., but differs in the punctiform im- 

 pressions of the thorax, in being much wider in proportion to its length, 

 and in its depth of colouring ; in the present spacies the body is chestnut. 

 brown, whereas in crassus it strongly inclines to black. Can it be a variety 



of that species ?

P. luteosignata. Blackish ; elytra each with three yellowish or ferrugi- 

 nous spots. Length 5 J lines ; breadth 2^ lines. 

 Pcenops luteosignata, Dej. Catal. 



Head coarsely punctured ; a shallow longitudinal indentation on the 

 front. Antenna bluish-black. Thorax numerously punctured each side,

274 [Sept. 1845. 



Dr. Morton offered some remarks on the skulls deposited 

 by him this evening. 



1. The four embalmed heads were brought from the Egyptian 

 catacombs, by Dr. C. Pickering. Two present all the character- 

 istics of the Negroid variety, or that in which the negro conformation 

 predominates ; the hair, especially in one of them, is long, but 

 harsh and somewhat wiry ; in the other it is cut short and presents 

 a finer texture. 



A third head of this series also exhibits some mixture of the 

 Negro race, but the little hair that remains is remarkably fine. 



The fourth has lost the facial bones, and is therefore not capable 

 of being precisely determined ; but judging from the cranium, it is 

 of Caucasian origin, and the hair, which is short and curly, is of a 

 very fine texture. 



2. The two ancient Peruvian heads possess great interest. They 

 were obtained by Dr. John Houstoun, an intelligent officer of the 

 British Navy, who politely sent them to Dr. Morton, with the fol- 

 lowing memorandum : " From an ancient Indian town called 

 Chiuchiu, or Atacama Baja, on the river Loa, eight leagues from 

 Calamo, and on the western edge of the desert of Atacama. Here 

 there are extensive remains of Indian houses, and a loop-holed 

 fortress built of mud. The huacha, or native burial place, is in a 

 terrace of soft sandstone, or volcanic tufia. The bodies are nearly 

 all buried in the sitting posture, with the hands either placed on 

 each side of the head, or crossed over the breast." These crania 

 have been moulded by an artificial process into the upwardly- 

 elongated or sugar loaf form, being thus very high and broad in 

 front, with a short antero-posterior diameter, both the forehead and 

 occiput bearing evidences of long-continued compression. These 

 heads correspond precisely with the descriptions given by the 

 earliest Spanish travellers in Peru, and especially by Cieza and 

 Torquemada, who saw the natives in various parts of the country 

 with heads moulded precisely in this manner ;* which was also 

 once in use among the Natchez tribes of the lower Mississippi, and 

 in various parts of Mexico. 



3. Two admirably characterized Indian crania, from ancient 

 cemeteries in Missouri, whence they were obtained by a zealous

inquirer into American Ethnography, â€” Dr. Wistlenius, of St. Louis- 

 Dr. Morton expressed his regret that the very interesting letter of 

 that gentleman to him had been inadvertently mislaid ; but he in- 

 tends to communicate it to the Society as soon as recovered. 



4. Two skulls of native Africans, the one a Hottentot, the other 

 a Mozambique. The first of these is the head of a woman, of 

 perhaps five and twenty. It is small in size, with all the strongly 

 marked negro features which are characteristic of these singular 

 people. For these crania, Dr. Morton expressed his acknowledg- 

 ments to Mr. John "Watson, of Cape Town, through his brother, Dr. 

 Gaviu Watson, of our Institution.

Dr. Leidy read the following notes on White Pond,

Mies taJcenon a visit to White Pond, in Warren Co., N'ew Jersey. 

 By Joseph Leidy, M. D. 



In the course of a pedestrian tour, during tbe latter part of the 

 last summer, accompanied by R. H. Kern, Esq., an artist of this 

 city, while in the northern part of New Jersey, I visited White 

 Pond, in Warren Co. This pond or lake is situated one mile north 

 of the village of Marksboro, is about one mile in circumference, and 




280 [Oct. 1845. 



received its name from its remarkable appearance, arising from its 

 bed being a deposit of a kind of white shell marl. At a short dis- 

 tance it has quite a wintry aspect, the shore appearing as if covered 

 with snow. On near approach, the ordinary observer will be much 

 Astonished, and the naturalist much interested in finding a vast 

 quantity of comparatively recent fossil fresh water shells, which not 

 only cover, but in many places appear to form the shore, extending 

 in breadth and depth for several feet. If a bunch of the Helianthe- 

 mum corymbosom, which grows here profusely, be pulled up, 

 nothing but shells and their fragments will be found adhering to its 

 roots. These shells are evidently washed from the deposit of marl 

 in the bed of the pond, as the neighboring inhabitants state that 

 the shores receive an accession of them every spring. 



With the exception of a small species of Cyclas and some frag- 

 ments of Unios, the shells are all univalve, and most of them are of 

 the same genera and species as those found in our fresh water, of 

 the present time, a few being extinct. Many of them have ad- 

 hering to their inside some root-like fibres, which upon examination 

 I find to be a species of Chara. 



It was a matter of much surprise to me that I could not find a 

 single living molluscous animal in the pond, and a neighbor in- 

 formed me "no snails had ever been found, and only a very few 

 muscles with flesh in," in it. 



The pond is in a limestone region ; its water, from its situation, 

 is necessarily calcareous, but probably at some anterior period of 

 time was much more so, was much more afi"ected by the internal 

 temperature of the earth than at the present time, and then teemed 

 with the animals whose testaceous coverings form the deposit of 

 marl. 



It is very evident that the deposit of shell marl belongs to the 

 newer Pliocene of some, or tertiary period of other geologists, from 

 the fact of the existence among the shells of the Limneus galbanus 

 in considerable numbers, which is an extinct species, the abundance 

 of other species now comparatively rare, and the absence of others 

 now common ; as for instance, the Planorbis trivolvis, our most 

 common species of that genus, is here completely replaced by the 

 P. campanulatus. 



Subjoined is a list of the various fossil shells which I picked up 




Oct. 1845.] ^^^ 



during several hours search along the shore, with the comparative

Mr. James D. Uana submitted the following : 

 General vleics on the\Glassification of Animals. 



In Cuvier's classification of animals, the division Radiata in- 

 cludes all invertebrated animals not comprised in either of the sub- 

 kingdoms, Articulata and Mollusca. Consisting thus only of refuse 

 species, and not limited by positive characters, as Owen states, we 

 should not expect that the group could be a natural assemblage. 

 No line of subdivision, however, has yet been made out, which has 

 met with general favor ; yet greater precision has been given to our 

 views of the affinities that run through the animal kingdom, by ap- 

 pealing to the nerves, the seat of sensibility and sentiment, as a 

 basis in classification ; and in this manner the subdivisions have been 

 characterised as follows, by Dr. Grant. 



I. The Vertehrata, having a brain and a spinal cord, constitute 

 the Spini-Yeetebrata. II. The Mollusca, having the nerves 

 forming generally a transverse series of ganglia disposed around 

 the oesophagus, the Cyclo-gangliata. III. The Articulata having 

 no proper brain, and the main cord which runs the length of the 

 body, double, the Diplo-neura. IV. The Radiata, having a ra- 

 diate structure in the body, and the nervous ganglia arranged in a 

 circle, Cyclo-neura. 




282 [Oct. 1S45. 



An objection might be made to this system, on the ground of the 

 apparent absence of nerves in some of the lower orders. But a 

 real absence can hardly be concluded, from our inability to dis- 

 tinguish them. Many of these animals show by their voluntary 

 motions and sensibility that nervous influences traverse the body : 

 moreover, nervous matter is secreted in lines. We can therefore 

 only infer the indistinctness, and not the absence of nerves from our 

 ineffectual efforts to trace them out; and we must consequently be 

 guided by general structure, in determining the relations of groups, 

 when the nerves fail of giving aid. 



The above arrangement fails, in some respects of present- 

 ing a clear idea of the system in nature, although highly philoso- 

 phical in its general features. A study of the animal kingdom, as 

 has been lately shown, brings to light lines or general systems of 

 development branching up from the lowest Infusoria to the higher 

 grades of life. It is not true that the forms among the lower grades 

 are actually copied in any of the imperfectly developed young of 

 ^he superior ; yet there is some general analogy, sufficient to indi- 

 cate that the former commence on the same system of development 

 with some of the latter, although carried essentially out of the direct 

 upward line by the peculiar vital forces of the species. The Roti. 

 fera are decidedly crustacean in type. Their stout mandibles 

 are precisely those of the Cyclopida; in position, and also in 

 general form ; and in their mode of reproduction, the animals are 

 closely similar; yet no young crustacean is ever a Rotifer. The 

 latter belongs to the same system of development with the former, 

 but is a distinct branch, from the I'egular line, characterized by the 

 peculiar natatory organs, which appear to be the analogues of the 

 branchial or basal appendages to the feet in Crustacea. The same 

 reasoning applies to the Bryozoa or Flustroid polyps, which are as 

 nearly allied to the Tunicata as the Rotifers to Crustacea.* It is a 

 side-development from the imaginary line, which connects the In- 



* The Bryozoa have been placed near the Rotifera ; but the absence of 

 mandibles, as well as their peculiar type of structure, separates them widely 

 from these crustaceoid species, and allie8 them as closely to the Tunicata. 

 with which they were first associated by Thomson, under the name of 

 Polyzoa. Lister has a finely illustrated article on this subject in the Philo- 

 sophical Transactions, for 1834, p. 365.

fusoria with the Tunicated Molluscs. The Entozoa afford other ex- 

 amples, one branch of them passing into the Crustacea through the 

 Lernseidae and Caligidae, and the other into the Annelida. 



These remarks are intended to support no monad or Lamarckian 

 theory, but only to elucidate the established principle that there are 

 in nature certain distinct systems or types of development. Each 

 species is developed with some reference to one or the other of these 

 systems, but through the agency of the vital forces peculiar to 

 itself â€” forces which there is reason to believe only creative power 

 can change. 



In accordance with these principles, the several orders of animals 

 may be arranged as follows : 



I. Yertebrata. 



II. Articulata. 

 Insecta, Myriapoda, 



Arachnida. 

 Crustacea, Annelida. 



lY. Radiata. 

 Echinodermata. 



II. MOLLrSA. 

 Cephalopoda, Pteropoda, 

 iGasteropoda, Conchifera, 

 Tunicata. 



Rotifera, Entozoa. 



Zoophyta, Acalephge. 



Bryozoa. 



Y. Protozoa or Infusoria. 



A radiated structure characterizes the simplest form of ani- 

 mal life. Passing up from the monad globule, the structure has 

 its highest development in the Echinoderms. Among Zoophytes, 

 the Hydra forms the first step upward, in which the digestive 

 cavity is a mere sac, which will work equally well inside out, and 

 the mode of reproduction is extremely simple. From this group 

 we pass to the Actinia, in which there is a distinct stomach and a 

 series of fleshy lamellae around the internal cavityâ€” the first rudi- 

 ments of an insolation of the function of digestion and generationâ€” 

 but the circulating fluid is only the elaborated chyle mingled with 

 more or less water from without. A step farther and we, find 

 separate organs for the functions of the liver, and a circulating 

 system, in some Echinoderms. Through the Bryozoa, the In- 

 fusoria are connected with the Tunicata and the other Molluscs; and 




284 [Oct. 1845. 



through the Rotifera and Entozoa, tliey connect with the Articulata, 

 thus passing by each way, out of the true Radiate type, into that 

 which characterizes the higher sub-kingdoms. The Bryozoa, Ro- 

 tifera and Entozoa, may be arranged in sub-kingdom Radiata, or 

 with the Mollusca and Articulata, whose types of structure they ex- 

 hibited, though under a Radiate form. 



The Echinoderms, although so strikingly peculiar in some 

 species â€” the Echini â€” yet through the Holothuria bear closely upon 

 the Articulata ; while the Acalcphs incline towards the Mollusca. 



In the above remarks, it is not attempted to trace out all the gra- 

 dations in the groups referred to, but only the most prominent. The 

 animal kingdom is throughout a net work of affiliations, yet there 

 are main trunks and larger branches, to which the smaller anasto- 

 mosing ramifications are subordinate. Much study will be required 

 before the system of nature from the Protozoa up, can be correctly 

 mapped out.

 description by Mr. James D. Dana, read 14th inst., reported 

 in favour of publication. 



Genus CoRTCiEns, (Dana.) 



Cyclopidae cephalo-thorace compresso, 3 â€” i articulate; oculis 

 medis inconspicuis, sed in frontem duabus lenticulis crystallinis 

 oblatis praegrandibus, et penitus aliis lenticulis prolatis minoribus, 




2S6 [Oct. 1845. 



his pigmento instructis; antennis quatuor, anterioribus simpli- 

 cibus, ia utroque sexu sequalibus et brevibus, posterioribus pre- 

 hensilibus ; pedibus duabus subcbeliformibus, aliis octo natatoriis ; 

 ovario externo simplici. 



This genus includes minute marine CyclopidEe, none of them 

 exceeding a line in length, and mostly not over two-thirds of a 

 line. They are remarkable for the two large hyaline lenses 

 placed in the front of the animal, their compressed form, the 

 short and simple anterior antennas, while the posterior pair is pre- 

 hensile, the presence of only two pair of prehensile legs, which are 

 succeeded by four pairs of natatory legs, similar to those in other 

 Cyclopidae. 



Posterior to the two large oblate lenses, wholly within the 

 animal, there are two oblong or prolate lenses, equally pel- 

 lucid and hyaline in appearance j each situated behind one of 

 the former, though remote from them, and separated by an 

 open unobstructed space. At the posterior extremity of each 

 of the inner, there is a long mass of pigment of an oblong shape, 

 usually of a crimson or blue color, so deep as to be almost 

 black. The structure here presented is so remarkable, that it 

 may be unsafe to offer any conjecture as to the nature of the 

 organs described. Yet after examining hundreds of specimens, 

 I may express an opinion that we have in these animals a pair of 

 eyes, each with two lenses. It is known that in water animals 

 the crystalline lens is usually spherical. But here we have an 

 oblate and prolate spheroid combined for the same result. The 

 genus Sapphirina, of Thomson, affords other examples of the same 

 character, which will be the subject of remark at a future time.

Dr. Joseph Leidy stated, as the result of his observation by 

 the microscope, of a portion of a vertebra of the fossil Zeuglo- 

 don of Alabama, that it presented all the characters, well 

 defined, of recent bone. 



Dr. Morton made the following remarks on the skulls of 

 two natives of New Holland, deposited by him this evening. 



After many fruitless attempts to obtain some of the crania of 

 these singular people, I am at length indebted to Dr. Charles 

 Nicholson, an intelligent naturalist of Sydney, for two remarkably 

 well characterised skulls, male and female, respecting which I 

 submit the following notes. 



Both these heads have several characters in common; they 

 are thick, ponderous, long and narrow, the forehead being low, 

 and the occipital region remarkably full. The orbits are deep 

 and quadrangular, the bones of the nose short and compressed, 

 and the nasal meatus wide and arched at the sides. 



The sutures are throughout remarkable for their simplicity, and 

 in the woman the coronal and spheno-temporal sutures are con- 

 tinuous ; an arrangement that is not unfrequent in the negro. 

 In the female head, also, the coronal region is very low. In the 

 man it is higher, and the area of the temporal muscle is particu- 

 larly conspicuous. This cranium is also marked by several cica- 

 trised depressions of the external table, of which the two largest 

 are on the frontal and parietal bones. These wounds are readily 

 accounted for in the irascible and pugnacious character of the 

 Australian savages. 



The preceding characteristics are, in general, analogous to those 

 of the African negro ; but a striking osteological difference be- 

 tween the two races consists in the far greater prominence of the 

 face in the Negro than in the Australian. In the former the 

 facial angle was established by Prof. Camper at 75^, and this has 

 been confirmed by nearly one hundred measurements by my 

 own hands. Yet in the two Australians before us, the angle in 

 the man measures 84Â°, in the woman SI'*, or more than the Cau- 

 casian mean. This, however, does not result, as we have seen, 

 from a well-formed cranium, but from a fulness of the supra- 

 orbitar region, and the small and non-projecting character of the 

 face. These features of the facial structure are remarkably ex- 




Dec. 1845.] ^^^ 



emplified in all the profile drawings I have seen of the Austra- 

 lians; for the face is often but little more salient than in the Eu- 

 ropean, while every other characteristic partakes largely of the 

 Negro.

 accordance vvith a resolution of the Society, directing appli- 

 cation to be made for a complete copy of the Natural History 

 of that State for the Library. The Society was informed 

 that no copy was at present at the disposal of the Depart- 

 ment. 



A paper, by Alfred T. King, M.D., of Greensburg, Pennsyl- 

 vania, entitled, " Descriptions of fossil foot prints," was read 

 and referred to the following Committee, viz. : Prof. Johnson, 

 Dr. Morton and Mr. Cassin. i 



Professor Johnson communicated some observations on the re- 

 lative evaporation from land and water surfaces, and stated the 

 means by which the question had been investigated, referring to 

 the report, a copy of which was presented to the Academy at the 

 last meeting, concerning the water sources near Boston, for a por- 

 tion of the details of experiments and observations, by which the 

 ratio in question had been established. 



The method of research was stated to have comprised, 1st, an 

 observation of the quantity of water falling in rain ; â€” 2d, the 

 quantity flowing away by the outlet of the source ; â€” 3d, the 

 depth removed from the surface of water by evaporation ; and 

 4th, the relation between the area of ground covered by water, 

 and of that constituting the water shed or drainage, from which, 

 owing to the direction of its slope, the rain falling upon it must 

 necessarily pass into the pond or lake, constituting the source of 

 immediately supply. The plan pursued required of course a de- 

 termination by actual surveys, of the total area of ground em- 

 braced within the district or hydrographic basin, and also that of 

 the water surface at several different stages of height correspond- 




296 [Dec. 1845. 



ing to the several periods of observation, in order to established the 

 ratio above referred to, between the land surface and the water 

 surface at each of those periods. 



With these data, and a simple formula of easy application, it 

 will be found practicable, not only to establish the ratio of supply 

 from the surrounding slopes, to the whole quantity of rain falling 

 during a season, but also the ratio which evaporation on land, 

 bears to that on the water surface. 



The quantity, or bulk of water, removed from any source, such 

 as a lake or pond, during any given period of observation, will 

 consist of, first, the draught, or flow from the outlet ; and second, of 

 that removed by evaporation. 



This quantity, determined by actual gauging, is readily referred 

 to the known area of water-surface, simultaneously observed â€” and 

 the depth to which it would cover the same surface if again re- 

 stored, is thereby ascertained. 



The supply of this quantity may be derived from, 1st, tbe store 

 previously accumulated in the pond or lake ; 2d, from ram which 

 falls directly on the water-surface during the period of observa- 

 tion ; or 3d, from the drainage, or flow from the surrounding 

 slopes. 



When the level of the lake falls during the period of observa- 

 tion, it is evident that something has been taken from the accu- 

 mulated store, and if the amount of depression of level, and the 

 depth of rain gauged, be not together equal to the sum of 

 draught and evaporation observed, it is evident that the third 

 source of supply â€” viz : the drainage from the water-shed, must 

 have furnished the balance. If, on the other hand, the level of 

 the source has risen, something has been added to the store of 

 water previously accumulated ; and in this case the depth of rain 

 and the supply from the icater-shcd have exceeded the sum of 

 draught and evaporation, and the measures of level and of area 

 show the amount of this excess. In either case the supply de- 

 rived from the surrounding slopes is easily eliminated, since all 

 the other terms of the equation are known. 



From the 7th of August, to the 1st of November, of the pre- 

 sent year, â€” the time in which the observations, surveys and gaug- 

 ings, required for the purposes above designated, were made in the 

 district of Spot Pond, 9 miles north west from Boston, â€” the depth

of rain guaged was 10.17 inches ; the evaporation from the sur- 

 face of the pond was 15.07 inches, showing the evaporation to be 

 48.1 per cent, more than the depth of rain. By an average of five 

 periods of observation into which this time was divided, the ratio 

 of water derived from the slopes to the rain which fell upon them 

 was .1765 to 1, or the actual depth was 1.79 inches. Conse- 

 quently, the evaporation from the land, and from its vegetable 

 covering, was .8235 of the rain which descended. Hence the 

 ratio between the evaporation from land, and that from water, was 

 .8235: 1.481 =.556:1. 



In the district of Long Pond, 18 miles south west from Boston, 

 from the 3Uth of July to the first of November, the depth of rain 

 was 10.46 inches; and of evaporation 12.78 inches â€” conse- 

 quently the evaporation was 22.2 per cent, more than the rain. 



The water derived from the slopes of the district was .1839 of 

 the whole fall of rain, leaving .8161: 1 as the proportion evapora- 

 ted from the land, or appropriated by vegetation, and the ratio of 

 evaporation from land to that from the water, was consequently 

 .8161: 1.222â€”697: 1. 



It appears from comparisons of the annual falls of rains for long 

 periods of years, that the quantities of rain above stated, as having 

 fallen in the months of August, September, and October last, at 

 the two sources mentioned, are above the average quantities due 

 to those months, and that consequently the ordinary ratio which, 

 in the neighborhood of Boston, and at the season above specified, 

 may be expected to flow from the land, and be available in water 

 .1765+.1839 



sources isâ€” â€” â–  =.1802 or almost exactly 18 per cent. At 



2 

 other seasons, very different proportions between the quantity of 

 rain, and that of evaporation, would be found to prevail. Whether, 

 in the winter season, the same ratio would be found to exist be- 

 tween the evaporation from land, and that from a water surface, as 

 has been found to prevail in summer, is a question still awaiting 

 a practical, experimental determination. The same methods of 

 research, as have been applied in the above cases, would be found 

 applicable to its solution, substituting only in part the fall of snow 

 gauged as water for that of rain, and the evaporation from a sur- 

 face of ice for that from a surface of water. 



The elevated and insulated position of Spot Pond, resting in a 




298 [Dec. 1845. 



basin composed of igneous rocks, and these partly bare of vege- 

 tation, was referred to, as favoring the continuance of the water 

 which falls upon the slopes, for a considerable time in contact 

 with the air, and subjected to evaporation before it reaches the 

 pond. This was considered adequate to account for the small 

 difference .1839 â€” .1764=.006J: between the drainage from that 

 district, and the one found at Long Pond.

Description of I^ossil Foot Prints. 

 By Alfred T. King, M. D. 



It is now more than a year since fossil foot prints were discovered 

 in the sandstone of the coal measures in ^\iestmoreland county, 

 Pennsylvania. Since then, numerous localities have been observed, 

 which contain well characterized impressions. Some of these are 

 similar to, and a few identical with, those which I first described, 

 but by far the greatest number are totally different from any which 

 have heretofore been observed. 



About three miles from this town, near the summit of the first 

 anticlinal roll, west of Chesnut ridge, one of the principal axes of 

 elevation belonging to the Alleghany range, in a coarse grained 

 sandstone, are eight remarkable impressions, all having the same 

 dimensions, the same distance apart, and forming a continuous se- 

 ries in a slight bent line. Each is of an ovoidal form, 13 inches 

 long, 9 broad, and from 3 to 6 deep. The impression is deep and 

 ovoidal before, but superficial behind, as though made by an animal 

 with a long and flexible pastern. 



Twenty-seven miles from Greensburg, on the summit of Ches- 

 nut ridge, in a coarse grained sandstone, are numerous imprints, 

 as perfect *as they are anomalous and remarkable. These imprints 

 are of different kinds ; the greatest number seem to have been 

 made by ruminant mammals, as the feet were cleft so as to resem- 

 ble those of the ox and deer, but much larger. They are of vari- 

 ous sizes, and differ from most living types, in having two hind 

 hoofs, which made deep and vivid impressions from one to two in- 

 ches behind the main track. 



The length of the largest, including the posterior imprints, is 9 

 inches, breadth 51 inches. 



The smaller vary from 4^ to 5i inches in length, by 2i to 4i in 

 breadth. The general form of these foot marks is ovoidal, the 

 largest portion being bebind as well as the widest part of the 




300 [Dec. 1845. 



cleft. The posterior impressions are each about the size of a walnut. 

 The interval between each foot mark is about 21 feet in the larger, 

 and 18 inches in the smaller. 



Besides these, and a few others which are identical or nearly 

 so with some which I have already described on a former oeca- 

 sion, there are four or five large imprints of a still more remarka- 

 ble character than any that have heretofore met my eye. They 

 are in a continuous line : each imprint is 13 inches long, and 9 

 wide. The toes, which are five in number, are thick and very 

 perfect. Four of these imprints are quite perfect, others are less 

 so, and many are nearly obliterated. The average distance be- 

 tween each impression is 3 feet 7 inches, with the exception of 

 the last two, which are seven feet apart. This seems to indicate 

 that there was once a track between these two, which has been 

 defaced by the erosive action of the elements upon the rock during 

 a series of ages. 



The Committee on Mr. Edward Harris' description of a 

 new species of Parus from Missouri, read at last meeting, re-

Description of anew species of Parus from the Upper Missouri. 

 By Edward Harris. 



Partis septentrionalis. Young, in summer plumage. 



Bill brownish black, short and stout. Iris dark brown. Feet greyish 

 blue. Upper part of the head, chin and foreneck dull dark ; the black of 

 the head scarcely descending ^to the hindneck, and that on the foreneck 

 hardly reaching to the breast. Cheeks and sides of the neck, a line running 

 from the base of the bill under the eye and almost meeting on the hindneckj 

 white. Back greyish, slightly tinged with yellow. Quills and tail feathers 

 dark greyish brown, margined with pure white ; secondaries conspicuously 

 so. Lower parts greyish white with an almost imperceptible tinge of yel- 

 lowisb under the wings, 



Length 5{. Wing 2L^ Tail 3'J inches.

A single specimen of this bird was procured on the 26th of July, on the 

 Yellow Stone River, about thirty miles below its junction with the Missouri. 

 It is evidently a bird of the season, with immature plumage, to which may 

 be attributed the dalness of the black on the head and throat. On com- 

 parison of this bird with P. Carolirunsis and P. atrieapillus, it will be per- 

 ceived that, beginning with the smallest bird, the parts which are black, de- 




Dec. 1845,] 301 



crease, and the white parts increase in size and intensity in ascending. In 

 leptentrionalis the outer web of the lateral tail feather is entirely white, ex- 

 cept a small portion near the base, where there is a slight tinge of grey next 

 the shaft, and the quills, secondaries and all the tail feathers are margined 

 more broadly and with a purer white than in the other species. 



I have given a table showing the comparative measurements of the three 

 American species of this division of the genus Parus having black heads, 

 which so closely resemble each other in voice, habits and markings ; and 

 have also added some measurements from a paper in the Archives of the 

 Academy, by M. de Selys-Longschamps, Corresponding member of the 

 Royal Academy of Brussels, extracted from their Bulletin, vol. 10, No. 7. 

 I have reduced his measurements to English inches and decimals, and have 

 given my own also in decimals for more ready comparison. It will be seen 

 that his specimen from Iceland {frigoris) corresponds so nearly with our 

 alricapillus, as to render it probable that it is identical, while his atricapillus 

 from Brisson is so near to Audubon's Carolinensis as to render it almost cer- 

 tain that the description of P. atricapilhis by the old authors was from our 

 small southern bird. If this opinion be correct, our Carolinensis should re- 

 sume the name of atricapillus, and the larger bird be called frigoris, a? 

 .suggested by M. de Selys-Longschamps. 



The note of this bird is similar to atricapillus, but its voice more liquid, 

 and less harsh and querulous in the utterance. Bill longer and stouter.

" atricapillus (Briss.) (from the paper of M. de

It will be seen by the above table, that while in each of the old American 

 species the wing is .125, or \ of an inch longer than the tail, in the new 

 bird, the tail is .281, or nearly ,J of an inch longer than the iving ; compared 

 with atricapillus, the total length is greater by J of an inch, the wing by \, 

 and tail by ^s or more than half an inch. 



The colours in this immature specimen are only to be depended upon as 

 showing the much greater development of the white, and smaller extent of 

 the black markings, than in the other species. For the sake of more easy 

 reference, the description has been made parallel with those of Audubon in 

 his Synopsis. I would propose as an appropriate English name for this 

 bird, the " long-tailed black-cap Titmouse."

Head small, black, produced anteriorly into a rostrum, which is more than 

 half the length of the thorax: antennae black, joints compressed, second small, 

 subglobular, third slightly longer than the fourth: thorax subquadrate, wider 

 at base than long, where it is nearly as wide as the base of the elytra ; sides

Black ; head small; antennae compressed, second joint small, third less 

 than the fourth, which is slightly longer than the fifth: thorax subquadrate, 

 as wide as the base of the elytra, wider behind than before, black, with the 

 lateral margins broadly yellow and ordinarily elevated ; anterior edge ob- 

 tusely rounded, and fringed with short black hairs ; posterior edge elevated :

 angles excurved, deflexed, rather acute : elytra black, with longitudinal, 

 slightly raised lines, and alternate obsolete ones ; interstices with numerous 

 transverse lines ; beneath and feet black ; pleurae yellow. This may prove 

 to be the marginellus of Fabricius, but the elytra are not sulcated, as is 

 stated to be the case in that species.

 antenucE blackish, not compressed, with three basal joints piceous, second 

 joint half as long as the third, which is somewhat shorter than the fourth, the 

 latter and fifth sub-equal ; thorax as in the preceding species, but the anterior 

 margin is also yellow, and the edge obtusely round ed ; the medial groove dis- 

 tinct and nearly entire : elytra black, with a tinge of reddish, and with the 

 anterior lateral fourth obsoletely rufo-piceous ; each elytrum with three lon- 

 gitudinal raised lines; lateral edges and suture raised; beneath and feet black- 

 ish. The obtusely rounded anterior margin of the thorax, and the peculiar 

 sulpture of the elytra, serve to distinguish this species from the preceding. 

 Lychndeis, Dej. Catal. 



L. morio. Black ; lateral thoracic margins dull testaceous ; elytra four- 

 ribbed. 5J 1. long ; 2 1. wide. Pennsylvania. 



Black or black-brown ; antennae compressed, black-brown, with the joints 

 sub-equal : thorax inequal, or each side of the middle impressed ; triangular, 

 with the sides slightly sinuated a little behind the apex, which is acutely 

 rounded ; minutely and densely wrinkled, black, with the anterior and lateral 

 margins dull testaceous: scutel acute -triangular : elytra finely granulate or 

 shagreened with four or rather five longitudinal raised lines, which are more 

 or less abbreviated before the apex : beneath and feet black, with the 

 terminal ventral segment dull testaceous. Form and size oi Lampyrii lati- 

 cornis, Fab., to which it is closely allied, but it differs from it in having the 

 apex of the thorax more acutely rounded, in the lateral margins being less 

 broadly testaceous, the disk more inequal, and in the raised lines of the 

 elytra being more distinctly defined. 



Ellychnia, Dej. Catal. 



E. autumnalis. Black-brown; sub-margins of the thorax whitish, with a 

 testaceous spot. 4:\ i. long ; 2 1. wide. Pennsylvania. 



Lampyris autJimnalis, Melsh. Catal. 



Oblong-oval, black-brown ; antennae moderately compressed, subfili- 

 form, black, with the second joint about half as long as the third : thorax 

 semioval, confertly and minutely wrinkled, with the disk suborbicular- 

 convex, black, glossy ; submargins whitish, with an oblong rosaceous 

 spot; exterior margins black and not attaining the apex ; basal edge very 

 slightly sinuate ; scutel glabrous ; elytra finely shagreened, with about 

 three obsolete, longitudinal raised lines ; beneath and feet black ; pleurse 

 within the margins whitish, tinged with rosaceous. Bears a resemblance 

 in the dispositions of the colors of the thorax to Lampyris corrusca, Fabr., 

 but it can hardly be confounded with that species, as it is almost three 

 times smaller, and has the elytral lines obsolete. It also resembles L. nigri- 

 cans, Say, but apart of inferiority of size, it differs from that species in hav- 

 ing the lateral thoracic margins exteriorly black, and the disk orbicular-con-

 middle, thence to the apex strongly narrowed ; apex acutely rounded ; yel- 

 lowish, tinged with rosaceous each side of the middle ; a medial anteriorly 

 and posteriorly abbreviated vitta, and a short submarginal one, black : 

 scutel testaceous, truncate at apex: elytra brown, obscurely two-ribbed, 

 with the sutural and lateral margins testaceous : beneath brown, with the 

 terminal ventral segments yellowish : feet brown with the bases of the femora 

 and tibiae, testaceous. Resembles L. cenirata, Say, from which, however, it 

 is distinguishable by the outlines of the thorax.

The following report, the conclusion of vvliicli was read at 

 the meeting of 23d inst., was referred for publication to the 

 Committee on Proceedings. 



Examination and analyses of samples of the alluvial soil of the Nile, from 

 Korosco, in Nubia. 



By Walter R. Johnson. 



The specimens about to be described are the same which were on the 21st 

 of January last presented to the Academy, by Mr. Gliddon, from Dr. Richard 

 Lepsius of Berlin, then in Egypt, (see Proceedings of the Acad. vol. 2, p. 

 195,) and referred to the reporter for examination. 



^0. 1. Earth of the Nile, taken from the summit of hillocks at thirty feet above 



the present level of the river, about a mile above Korosko. 

 This earth is partly in powder and partly in lumps. In some of the latter 

 distant traces of folia, *r plies, marking an imperfect stratification, are to be 

 seen. Along these seams fractures often occur. Throughout the lumps are 

 to be observed innumerable cavities or spiracles of a tortuous form, giving 

 the impression of having been produced by some species of vermes. Many 

 of these are lined and some nearly filled up with carbonate of lime. 

 Tubes of the same material are found in a separate state, and some plane sur- 

 faces are covered with it. The whole has a light spongy appearance, and, 

 the resemblance is strengthened by the vermicular cavities, which remind 

 one of the white tubes often found traversing masses of common sponge. 

 Very fine micaceous particles are distributed pretty copiously through the 

 masses distinctly perceptible to the eye, and clearly exhibiting their forms 

 under the lens. To the naked eye no ferruginous appearance is discernible, 

 but the microscope shows innumerable points of a deep red color. The mud 

 appears to have been deposited at successive, but not very distant periods ;

while soft to have been penetrated by myriads of animalculffi ; then dried 

 and baked into a solid mass, imprisoning and destroying the animals, 

 and forming a very porous soil, which, on subsequent exposure to water, 

 strongly impregnated with lime, received so much of the latter as to fill up 

 many of the pores when the water came to be dried up. 



Analysis. 1. The existence of roots, stems, or of any other fibrous matter 

 was sought for in vain in this specimen, and the magnet separates from it 

 only minute quantities of magnetic oxide of iron. 



2. Fifty grains placed in a syphon-shaped drying tube in which it was ex- 

 posed to a heat of 212Â° for thirty minutes, and over which, during the whole 

 time, a current of perfectly dry air, amounting in all to 200 cubic inches was 

 passed, lost by this treatment 2.1 grains or 4.2 per cent. 



3. One hundred grains of the soil were boiled for ten minutes in four ac- 

 tive ounces of distilled water, then filtered and washed. The insoluble resin 

 duum, separated and dried, weighed 93.5 grains, and is of a reddish grey, 

 slightly varying in color from the original soil. Deducting 4. 2 from the 

 loss, the part soluble in boiling water is 2.3 per cent. To the clear solution 

 nitrate of silver imparted a slight milkiness, indicating the presence of chlo- 

 rine. Chloride of barium, producing no turbidness, implied the absence of 

 soluble sulphates. Oxalate of ammonia, gave evidence of a salt of lime so- 

 luble in boiling water. Phosphate of soda and ammonia gave no evidence of 

 magnesia, and ferrocyanide of potassium, none of iron. The liquid slowly 

 evaporated to dryness, left a residuum, which in the bottom of the porcelain 

 basin separated into a yellowish ring of crenic acid, giving the usual impres- 

 sion, first of acidity and then of astringency to the taste, and a central por- 

 tion of white crenate or carbonate of lime. 



4. Another portion of one hundred grains was exposed in a platinum cruci- 

 ble to a dull red heat over a lamp, by which it lost 8.65 grains, showing the 

 insoluble organic matter to be 2.15 per cent. The same portion afterwards 

 exposed for fifteen minutes to a nearly white heat lost in addition 5.3 grains; 

 and became of a light brick red color. 



5. A third portion of one hundred grains finely pulverized was placed in 

 a green glass flask. An ounce of distilled water was poured over it, and an 

 open-mouthed tube containing chlorhydric acid was inserted, the mouth 

 closed with a cork traversed by a small glass tube surmounted by a tube 

 containing chloride of calcium. The whole being carefully counterpoised, 

 the acid was by degrees decanted and allowed to act on the soil. Heat was 

 cautiously applied near the close of the operation, bringing the liquid at 

 length to gentle ebullition, but taking care that no pure steam entered the 

 chloride tube. On cooling the apparatus, the air was allowed to pass through 

 a second chloride tube attached to the first, thus avoiding the hygrometric 

 moisture of the air. When the whole apparatus had become cool, heat was 

 again applied and the boiling and cooling repeated with the same precautions? 

 until, on re-weighing, no loss was found to occur between one boiling and an- 

 other. The final loss of carJowicaci'c? was thus ascertained to be 5.55 per cent. 



6. Having withdrawn the cork from the flask, more chlorhydric acid was 

 added, and the boiling continued until every thing soluble had been taken up. 



38 




320 Dec. 1845.] 



The undissolved residuum filtered, washed, and ignited weighed 63.55 

 grains. It is a powder of a lighter grey than the original soil. Minute par- 

 ticles of white quartz, and some with a reddish tint are discernible by the 

 help of a lens. 



7. The solution filtered from the above residuum was treated with sulphy- 

 dric acid, to ascertain whether lead, copper, mercury, tin, antimony, or 

 arsenic, existed in the soil. A reddish white tint, indicative of a bare trace 

 of antimony, was all which could be procured. The liquid smelling strongly 

 of sulphydric acid, the sulphur was separated, and then the solution was 

 neutralized with pure ammonia. 



8. Sulphydrate of ammonia was added, throwing down a copious precipa- 

 tate of sulphuret of iron and alumina, which was filtered out, redissolved in 

 chlorhydric acid, with a little nitric, and boiled to peroxidize the iron ; the 

 solution was then precipitated and boiled with pure potash, separating the 

 iron, which being ignited, weighed in the state of peroxide 8.07 grains. 



9. Having acidulated the potash liquid, it was precipitated by ammonia 

 and gave of ignited alumina 2.64 grains. 



10. The solution, filtered from the sulphurets, was concentrated, treated 

 with chlorhydric acid, the precipitated sulphur separated, and after neutral- 

 izing by ammonia, was precipitated with oxalate of ammonia, allowed to 

 repose 18 hours, then heated and filtered. The oxalate of lime thus obtained, 

 was, after ignition, repeatedly moistened with a solution of carbonate of 

 ammonia, and re-ignited till it ceased to gain weight. The carbonate of lime 

 was 12.6 grains. 



11. Ammonio-phosphate of soda applied to the liquid filtered from the 

 oxalate of lime, after the same had been duly concentrated, entirely cooled 

 and neutralized by pure ammonia, threw down ammonio-phosphate of mag- 

 nesia, which, separated and ignited, gave of phosphate of magnesia, 5.15 

 grains, equal to 2.06 grains of magnesia, or 4.25 of its carbonate.

Xo. 2. â€” Specimen of ike present soil of ike Valley of Korosco, taken at a 

 heigkt of three feet above the Nile. 

 This earth is also partly in lumps and partly in powder. The former exhibit 

 no marks of stratification, and so far as can be observed, have no tendency to 

 part in one direction more than in another. The texture is open and porous, 

 but the pores are not filled as in Xo. 1, with any deposite of white matter, ex- 

 cept here and there a rather light gray in the interior of the cavities. In 

 some of the lumps, minute rootlets are seen traversing the mass in different 

 directions. The color of this soil is considerably darker than that of No. 1, 

 due in part no doubt to the absence of carbonate of lime. Ferruginous par- 

 ticles abound in this, a,s in the preceding specimen, but those of mica are of 

 far less frequent occurrence. 



Time has allowed me to make but a few trials to ascertain the composition 

 of this soil, as it was believed to be of more interest to determine the relative 

 characters of the oldest and of the most recent ones, rather than that of an in- 

 termediate period. By twice drying in the inverted syphon apparatus, and 

 in the last instance passing over it 200 cubic inches of air, thoroughly dry, 

 it lost 2.6 per cent. By treatment in the apparatus for separating carbonic 

 acid, and boiling five times successively to expel the last atom of that mate- 

 rial, using a solution of pure baryta to ascertain when the escaping air, ex- 

 pelled in boiling, ceased to be mixed with that acid, it was found that the 

 amount of carbonic acid was only l.V per cent, equivalent to 3.9 per cent, 

 of carbonate of lime. On separating the soil with the sieve, the finest portion 

 â€” that passing through the gauze sieve â€” was found to afford decidedly more 

 magnetic oxide of iron, than specimen No. 1. 



iV^o. 3. â€” Specimen of the earth newly deposited zt Korosco, the IStk ^f 

 August, 1844. 

 This specimen is entirely in powder, and of a color very nearly approach- 

 ing that of No. 2. 



Particles of mica are of rather rare occurrence. A few minute fragments of 

 straw or grass are detected, and by a gauze sieve, of which the meshes are 

 100 to the inch, and the spaces to the threads as 2\ to 1 in diameter, making 

 the open space -^ of an inch square only, 22 per cent, of this earth was 

 arrested. A quantity of very fine fibrous or downy matter was also collected 

 by the seive. Portions of both the coarser and the finer parts of this soil 

 are attracted by the magnet, 4-tenth3 of one per cent, being found in an 

 average portion of it. On being washed, the coarser part is found to be a 

 sand, composed of quartz, red and white, fragments of schorl, and garnet?, 

 of magnetic oxide of iron, a little mica, and a few fragments of tubes, such 

 as are sees traversing the older portions of soil already examined. This 

 composition indicates that this specimen has resulted] from the decomi^osi- 

 tion of primitive rocks, and that their debris has been mixed with some por- 

 tion of the anterior depo&its along the river banks. 



Analysis. 



1. Dried 100 grains and found the loss, 3.7 grains. 



2. Transferred the same to a well closed platinum crucible, and ignited ; which 




322 [Dec. 1S45. 



caused an additional loss ot :j.57 per cent. The powder having now 

 a dull reddish gray color, was again heated, and with access of air, stirring 

 occasionally with a platinum spatula, to facilitate the complete combustion 

 of organic matter. 



By this treatment the additional loss was .13 grain, showing the organic 

 matter in the soil to be 3. TO per cent. To ascertain what part of the matter 

 was soluble, a second portion of 100 grains was placed in a green glass matras 

 and boiled for an hour, with three ounces of a saturated solution of car- 

 bonate of ammonia; the clear liquid was decanted, and a second portion 

 3f the carbonate added, boiling as before, and in the same way a third por- 

 tion was subsequently added. The solution being acidulated with acetic 

 iicid, acetate of lead was applied, producing when dried,4.7 grainsof crenate 

 of lead, equivalent to 2.28 grains of crenic acid, and showing the insoluble 

 organic matter to be 1.42 grains. 



::. Placed the reddened powder of the first 100 grains in a matras, and 

 poured over it an ounce of pure water and half an ounce of pure chlorhydric 

 acid; boiled half an hour, decanted the clear liquid, put in another ounce of 

 water and half ounce of acid, boiled for the same length of time, decanted 

 once more and repeated the operationâ€” then filtered, washed carefully, 

 ignited and weighed the residue, found it 70.2 grains, showing that 22.4 

 grains of matter have been dissolved by the acid. 



4. The solution in chlorhydric acid, reduced to a convenient bulk, was 

 boiled with a little nitric acid, to peroxidize the iron, by which it was 

 changed from greenish yellow to a fine deep red color, and while still hot 

 precipitated with pure ammonia, boiled to condense the precipitate, filtered, 

 washed for more than 24 hours, and until all alkaline reaction ceased. 



r>. The precipitate was boiled in a strong solution of caustic potash, until 

 the clear liquid yielded with chlorhydric acid the usual indications of a 

 sufficient excess of alkali. 



*i. The remaining precipitate of oxide of iron v.-a3 fike/ed and washed for 

 12 hours, with hot water, separated, dried, and ignited sufficiently long to 

 reduce the whole to the state of peroxide, which then weighed 9.18 grains. 

 7. The potash solution was acidulated with chlorhydricacid, and precipi- 

 tated by carbonate of ammonia, yielding, after being thoroughly washed, 

 dried and ignited, 6.55 grains of alumina. 



3. The ammonical solution filtered from oxide of iron and alumina, was 

 treated for phosphate of lime, and afterwards with oxalate of ammonia, and, 

 allowing ample time to precipitate, the oxalate of lime was filtered, washed, 

 converted into carbonate, and in that state weighed, giving 6.7 grains. Con- 

 verted this, by exposure three times to a white heat, into caustic lime, weigh- 

 ing exactly 3.8 grains. 



'.'. The liquid from which oxalate of lime had been filtered, was now with 



the usual precautions precipitated with ammonio-phosphate of soda, the 



precipitats cautiously washed, and the double phosphate ignited, giving 



phosphate of magnesia 5.18 grains, equivalent to 1.89 grains of magnesia.

 oxide of manganese. 



II. A third portion of 100 grains of the soil, treated for carbonic acid with 

 all the precautions of boiling the liquid, and alternately cooling off ten times, 

 until the pure baryta showed no more carbonic acid, and the successive 

 weighings gave identical results, the quantity of that ingredient was found 

 to be only 1.4 grains. Hence the soil is composed of

The excess is here attributable in part to the peroxidation of the iron, which 

 in the soil is partly in the state of magnetic oxide, and in part to the pre- 

 sumed slight amount of potash still adhering to the oxide and alumina. 



Sand taken fro7n the thermal spring at Ohne, on the Southern frontier of the Pro- 

 vince of Butir-el-Hagar, on the Western hank of th" Nile â€” ^vherc the tempera- 

 ture of the water is 131Â° Fah. 



This sand obviously contains the debris of granitic rocks. Particles of 

 quartz and mica are very abundant, and the magnet takes up a notable por- 

 tion of magnetic oxide of iron. Particles of highly ferruginous clay are in- 

 terspersed among it, resembling crumbs of bog iron ore, and leading to the 

 supposition that the heat of the spring is occasioned by the decomposition 

 of pyritous rocks, whose insoluble debris it brings in minute portions to 

 the surface. The gauze sieve already mentioned retains 25 per cent, of this 

 sand, including nearly all the particles of ferruginous clay. The portion 

 which passes the seive, resembles, in almost every particular, the sandy por- 

 tion washed out of the newly deposited soil, except of course the dififerent 

 degree of its fineness. Both have particles of red and white quartz, both 

 show magnetic cxide of iron, the sand of the spring in the greater abundance. 

 It is remarked that the particles of this oxide in the portion of sand which 

 passes the sieve, is far greater than in that which remains upon it, which we 

 might anticipate, on the supposition that the sand is brought up by the 

 spring. The greater specific gravity of the particles of oxide than that of 

 the quartz, would allow larger masses of the latter than of the former to he 

 thrown up by a current of given velocity. 




324 [Dec. 1S45. 



Bringing together the results of the analysis of the ancient and that of 

 the most recent soil, we find the following composition in 100 parts.

The loss in the analysis of the ancient soil, is attributed in part to the 

 combined water, which no doubt existed in the peroxide of iron, and in part 

 to the chloride of sodium and phosphate of alumina, of which some traces 

 were observed, but of which time did not allow me to make a minute ex- 

 amination, or to repsat the analysis for the purpose of an exact determina- 

 tion of their proportion. The most striking difference between the ancient 

 and the modern soils is to be found in the far higher proportion of carbonic 

 acid, lime, and magnesia in the former, and the greater abundance of alumina 

 and of insoluble silicates in the latter. The mattersoluble in water is nearly 

 the same for both, and the oxide of iron widely diflferent.
