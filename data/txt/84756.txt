On a Mile in the Ear of the Or. — Prof. Leidy remarked that 

 he had received a letter from Dr. Charles S. Turnbiill, in whicli 



he stated that while studying the 

 anatomy of the ear he had dis- 

 covered in several heads of steers, 

 at the bottom of the external 

 auditory meatus, a number of 

 small living parasites. Tiiey 

 were founil attaclied to tiie sur- 

 face of the meml)raiia tym[)ani. 

 Sjiecimens of the parasite pre- 

 served in gh-cerine, and a petro- 

 sal bone with the membrana tym- 

 pani, to which several of the 

 parasites were clinging, were also 

 sent for examination. These 

 prove to be a mite or acarus, ap- 

 j)arently of the genus (7(imai<u.<. 

 Tiie body is ovoid, translucent 

 white, about ^- of a line long, and

are from -? to I a line long. The feet are terminated by a five- 

 lobed disk and a pair of claws, as rej^resented in figure 3. The 

 palpi are six-jointed, as represented in figure 1. The mandibles 

 end in pincers or cheljB, resembling lobster claws, as represented 

 in figure 2. The movable joint of the chelae has two teeth at the 

 end. The opposed extremity of the fixed joint of the chelas is 

 narrow, and ends in a hook. 



Whether this mite is a true parasite of the ear of the living 

 ox, or whether it obtained access to the position in which it was 

 found after the death of the ox in the slaughter house, has not 

 yet been determined. Di'. TurnbuU observed it onl}' in the posi- 

 tion indicated.

Mr. Thomas Meehan said that among the ranchmen and 

 miners of California a belief exists that the mammoth Sequoias 

 will live eight or ten years after being girdled. These trees often 

 had strips of bark taken off for some distance up, and completely 

 round, for the purpose of exhibition in other countries. 



This belief has been generall3' discredited by those of us ac- 

 customed to the prevalent ideas of the effects of girdling. But 

 experience having taught him how often popular observation was 

 nearl}^ at least correct, notwithstanding our predisposition to be- 

 lieve implicitly accepted conclusions, he had watched for some 

 opportunity to test, by some observations of his own, the Cali- 

 fornian idea. 



A few years ago an Austrian pine on his grounds had the main 

 stem partially girdled by an insect. The opportunity before re- 

 ferred to suggested itself; and he completed the injurj', entirely 

 girdling the stem. It was then staked securel}^ to prevent the 

 wind from breaking it off at the injured place. The part above the 



[April li], 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 1] 



injuiy was about four years old, and the whole tree perhaps ten 

 years. It continued to grow both above and below the wound 

 until tlie last season, when the ui)per portion died. The whole of 

 the section between the horizontal tier of brandies above the oird- 

 ling and the tier below, a space of about eighteen inclies, died the 

 same season with the girdling. He now exhibited a portion of 

 the trunk with part of the stem, wliich died the year of girdling; 

 and part of the piece which had grown above, and died last year. 

 There were four concentric rings of wood in the former and 

 eight in the latter, sliowing that it had made four annual circles 

 of wood after the complete girdling. 



He then observed that we might assume that the vital functions 

 could scarcely be carried on between the upper portions of the tree 

 and lower, if the intervening cells were dead. He supposed the 

 cells forming the annual concentric masses of wood had a longer 

 period of vitality in some species of trees than in others. In many 

 trees it was well known that such a girdling as that performed on 

 the pine would destroy them in one season. A recent examina- 

 tion of a trunk of Paulownia led him to believe that in that tree 

 the cells of the annual circles lived but two 3'ears. It was probaltle 

 that even in tlie pine famil}' the period of vitality might var^- with 

 different species. In the Rocky Mountains of Colorado he had seen 

 man}- hundreds of trees of Finns ponderosa which had the whole 

 of the l)ark for about six feet from the ground stripped from the 

 trees for the purpose of getting at the inner bark, wliich was used 

 as food b}' the Ute Indians; yet he saw no trees which indicated 

 that tliey had been destroj'ed by this heav}^ girdling process. 

 In the case of the Austrian pine, however, though the formation 

 of wood went on above the girdled portion, growth was not as 

 vigorous as before. The first season after the j'oung shoots were 

 about one foot in length; but these annually decreased, until last 

 year they were but two inches. 



Prof. Cope exhibited the cranium of a humped-backed whale 

 from the Caribbean Sea, obtained by Dr. Goes, of St. liartholomow's. 

 and ])resented to the Academy through the liberality of Messrs. 

 Wm. S. Vaux and Isaac Lea. He pointed out that while the 

 scapula and cervical vertebrjv were of the type of the true M^eg- 

 opfcrfe, the development of the coronoid process of tiic mandible 

 was comparable to that seen in lUihxnoptrra. The orliital jilates 

 of the frontal are rather wider than in M. luurjimana. The species 

 was named Mcf/aplcra hrlUcosn. Its size was about that of the 

 M.longimana, but the llippers were shorter. A full description 

 appeared in the Proceedings of the .American Philosophical 

 Society for 1871. 



Prof. Cope exhiliitcd a portion of the skeleton of a large cro- 

 codile from the cretaceous green sand of New Jcrsc}-, belonging 

 to the genus Holops. The teeth were smooth, cyliudric, acute.

 were very large, and of depressed form; the walls of the long 

 bones unusuall}' thin, and pneumatic foramina large. He called

LIST OF THE REPTILIA OF THE EOCENE FOEMATION OF 

 NEW JERSEY. 



BY EDW. D, COPE. 



The Eocene Formation occiii^ies in Xew Jersey, according to 

 Cook, a band extending from near the centre of the State, north- 

 eastward, to the Atlantic coast in Mammouth County, in the 

 neighborhood of Deal. Lithologically it consists of a light green 

 glauconite mixed with variable quantities of clay and fine sand. 

 The character of its fossils is marine, including sharks, rays, 

 sawfishes, and swordfishes in great abundance. These forms 

 especially abound in the southwestern part of its area, for ex- 

 ample, at Vincenttown, but in the northeastern region reptiles 

 are more abundant, with cetaceans. It is also in that section, 

 near to Shark River especiallj^, overlaid by a thin stratum of 

 loamy sand, which contains fragmentarj' remains of terrestrial 

 vertebrates of the Miocene period ; e. g., Elotherium, Dicotyles, 

 Bhinocerus, etc. Whether the larger mammal described as Hemi- 

 caiilodon (Cope) and Anchippodus (Leidy) were derived from this 

 or from the Eocene bed remains uncertain. 



The reptiles belong to the Ophidia, the Crocodilia, and the 

 Testudinata, and number only ten species. They are as fol- 

 lows: —

Establisliecl on an anterior portion of a carapace. This is very 

 peculiar in all respects, and throws much light on the character 

 of the genus. The anterior vertebral or nuchal bone is preserved 

 entire. It is recognized from its combination of a free concave 

 margin, with a basis of attachment of the first dorsal vertebra, 

 and from the first marginal bone on each side sj'mmetrically 

 placed. The sutures thus exposed are very peculiar, and entirely 

 unlike those of any turtle known to me. It is a kind of com- 

 pound gomphosis, or mixture of the gomphosial and squamosal 

 types. The prominences are long, and penetrate deeply-; they 

 are flat, and man}' grooved on both sides. The suture uniting 

 the nuchal and first costal consists of a median lamina from the 

 former, and two from the latter, fitting into grooves, but deeply 

 grooved, and divided on the edges. That uniting the first mar- 

 ginal is double squamosal, the former entering a groove of the 

 latter, which sends its inferior lamina far under the marginal. 



The nuchal is crescent shaped, the anterior or free margin 

 forming the concavity'. The liorns or external angles arc nuich 

 more produced than is usual in turtles, extending on the inner 

 side of the marginals, and gradually tapering to a point. The 

 middle of the edges of the first marginal takes part in the con- 

 cavity of the front" of the carapace. This concavity is thus more 

 extensive, both in respect to its deptli and width, than in any 

 living member of the order, having but a slight representation in 

 some of them. Its edge is subacute in the middle and thickened 

 laterally. It is bordered on cacli side apparently b}' a i)rominent 

 angle for the edge of one (the best preserved) of the marginals 

 turns posteriori}', and is thinned out. 



The texture of the bone is closely spong}-, with scarcely any

dense layer ■svithout or within. This point alone distinguishes 

 the form from any found in the cretaceous strata. The external 

 surface of the carapace is smooth, and without trace of sutural 

 grooves of the horny scuta. The carapace is very thick, more so 

 than in any species of the order Ivuown, except the Agomphus 

 firmiis.

The length of the carapace, if proportioned to the size of the 

 nuchal bone, as in Chehjdra serpentina^ would be fort}' inches, 

 with the width nearly the same. If the length of head and tail 

 were relatively less than in that species, and more than in the 

 species of Chelone, the total length would have been seven and 

 one-half feet. 



Of the affinities of the genus little can be said. The characters 

 of the plastron, as I noted when describing the genus, are moi'e 

 those of Chelydra than Chelone, and the present specimen adds 

 to the weight of tlie conclusion. The extensive union of the first 

 marginal and nuchal, and of the same with the first costal, are 

 very different from CheJone. The character of the sutures is 

 equallj' distiuct from an^'thing seen in Chelydra. 



As compared with L. polemicus, the present reptile is thicker 

 and probably considerably larger. The plastron is usualh' equal 

 to or thicker than the carapace in tortoises. In the present animal 

 the carapace is much thicker than the plastron of L. jyolemicus.

 attention of A. J. Smith, director. 



LEMBONAX INSULAKIS, Cope, sp. nov. 



Established on marginal and nuchal bones of a specimen from 

 the Eocene bed of Tincenttown. The first marginal forms a pro- 

 minent marginal angle, the sutures of the nuchal and second 

 marginal approaching each other at a strong angle. The margin 

 of the nuchal is continuous with the transverse edge of the ad- 

 joining marginal, and has not bordered it on the free side for any 

 distance, as is striking in L. popylaeus. There has evidently 



[April Ifi, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PniLADELPIIIA. 17 



been less concavity of this margin than in that turtle. The 

 suture between the two is also peculiar in not underninning the 

 marginal to the same extent, and a portion of it underruns the 

 nuchal. It is indeed possible that these bones represent the 

 caudal and adjacent marginals, but the presence of a fragment 

 bearing the support of a vertebra is more suggestive of the nu- 

 chal. 



A prominent pectiliarit}' of the lione is its great thickness. Tlie 

 first marginal near its suture with the second, measures an inch 

 and three-quarters. The free margin is ver^' thick and obtusely 

 rounded.

Should the size of this turtle be proportioned to the thickness 

 of the carapace, or to its relation to corresponding parts of the 

 L. propylaeus, it will have been one of the largest species of the 

 order, say from ten to twelve feet in length. 



The above descriptions leave much to be desired in regard to 

 the characters of the genus. The peculiarities of the sutures 

 distinguish the form from Chelydra, and the association with an 

 especially marine fauna suggests natatory limbs like those of Pro- 

 jAeura or Chelone.

THECACHAMPSA SERRATA, Cope, sp. nov. 



Established on cervical and dorsal vertebrae of an adult croco- 

 dile of about the size of a South American Jacare {J. sclei-ops). 

 The teeth are not preserved, so that reference to this genus is 

 only made in consequence of the simple form of the hypapophyscs 

 of the cervical vertcbrjc, a character belonging also to other 

 genera. The neural arches and odontoid element are co-ossified. 

 The axis is compressed concave laterall}', and witli a very pro- 

 minent hypapophysial extending on the auterioi- half keel of the 

 body. The parapophj'ses are inferior or on the lower plane, and

look back-wards. They are separated by a concavity from the 

 diapophysial projections, wMcli is continuous with the anterior 

 surface of the odontoid. 



In a posterior cervical the cup of the centrum is transverse 

 oval, and the neural canal ample and transverse. The parapo- 

 physial articular surfaces are J-shaped, the convexity forwards. 

 The roof of the canal is deeply excavated on the middle line 

 above, and from the fossa thus formed the ridge of the neural 

 spine rises. This ridge is peculiar in the possession of a double 

 row of teeth or serrse separated by pits ; on the posterior edge a 

 median series of teeth is most prominent. The edge of the cup 

 is thick, of the ball strongly shouldered, the shoulder obsoletel}"- 

 ridged. 



The first dorsal has a similar transverse articular surface and 

 neural canal, and the serration of the neural spine is strongly 

 marked. The parapoph3'sial articular -face is an isosceles spheri- 

 cal triangle with the long angle upwards.

The serration of the neural spines constitutes the most striking 

 peculiarity of this crocodile. The use of the structure cannot 

 be surmised, as they were in large part at least concealed by 

 muscles and integument. It is intermediate in size between the 

 T. ininoi' and T. squankensis.

The following paper was presented for publication: "Sj'nopsis 

 of the Species of Cheljdrina?." By E. D. Cope. 



Notice of Corundum. — Prof. Leidy remarked that the speci- 

 mens of corundum presented this evening were of unusual interest 

 and beautj'. They were from Franklin, Macon County, N. C, 

 where the mineral is said to occur in some abundance, contained 

 in a vein of chlorite. The specimens are fragments of large 

 cr^-stals, presenting portions of the faces of the latter. They 

 exhibit in association the three varieties of the mineral. Mainly 

 composed of gra}' corundum, with the crystal surfaces of bright 

 rub>-, and the interior with mingled rich blue sapphire. The rub}' 

 and sapphire, though of fine color, have not been found in a con- 

 dition fit for gems. Some small crystals of gray corundum 

 exhibit brilliant and translucent summits of rub}'. 



A large crj'stal of corundum from the same localit}' is now in 

 the cit}'. It is a truncated, six-sided, compressed p3-ramid, about 

 two feet in length, and weighs about three hundred pounds, Tlie 

 summit is one foot by six inches in diameter. It is much fissured, 

 and has a quantit}- of chlorite adherent or partially imbedded 

 towards the base. The surface is ruby; the interior is of gra}' 

 corundum with mingled sapphire. 



Remarks on Fossils from Wyoming. — Prof. Leidy made the 

 following observations: The A-arious fossils from the tertiary for- 

 mation of "Wyoming, which both I and Prof. ^larsh have referred 

 to Lophiodon, I suspect to belong to a genus distinct from this, as 

 represented by tlie species Lophiodon isselensc, of France. In 

 this, as in the related and living Tapir, there are six molars in 

 both ujjper and lower series. In the upper premolars of the Lo- 

 phiodon i.'^seleiise a single ridge extends from the outer part of the 

 crown to the inner lobe, and the last lower molar has a trilobate 

 crown. 



In JlyrarJnjus agrarius, which I suspect to be the same as the 

 Lo])hiodon Jhnrdianus of Prof, Marsli, there are seven molars to 

 both upper and lower series. The upper two back premolars have 

 two well-marked ridges extending between the outer and inner 

 l)art of the crown ; and the last lower molar has a bilobed crown, 

 as in the Tapir. 



Portions of two lower jaws, which I exhibit, probably belong 

 to a smaller species of Ifgraclnjus, perhaps to the same aniuuil as 

 1872.] 




20 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



that indicated by Prof. Marsh under the name of Lophiodon nanus. 

 One of the specimens was obtained, by Dr. Joseph K. Corson, 

 U. S. A., at Grizzly Buttes ; the other, by Dr. J. Van A. Carter, at 

 Lodge-pole Trail, Wyoming. In both these the molar series is 

 six, and the last molar has a bilobed crown. In the upper jaw 

 specimen referred to Lophiodon nanus by Prof. Marsh, there are 

 seven molars. One less in the lower jaw may be regarded as a 

 less important character than the others separating Hyrachyus 

 from Lophiodon., in which view I refer the specimens to the former 

 under the name of Hyrachyus nanus. Probably also the other 

 species which have been noticed under the wfiinQB of Lopliiodon 

 modestus. L. affinis, and L. jjumilus, may be viewed as pertaining 

 to Hi/rachyus. 



I farther exhibit portions of jaws of several individuals of a 

 small pach3'derm allied to Hyopsodus. The specimens were dis- 

 covered, by Dr. J. Van A. Carter, at Grizzly Buttes and Lodge-pole 

 Trail, Wyoming. 



In Hyopsodus, seven molars, a feeble canine, and the incisors 

 together form an unbroken row. In the lower jaw specimens, 

 which I propose to refer to a genus with the name of Microsyops, 

 six molars, a comparatively large canine, and the incisors form 

 the corresponding series. 



In Hyopisodus, the lower true molars, except the last one, are 

 of uniform width at the fore and back part of the crown. In 

 Microsyops the fore part of the crown is decidedl}^ narrower than 

 the back part. In both genera the crown of these teeth is com- 

 posed of an outer pair of deraiconoidal lobes with crescentoid 

 summits and an inner pair of conical lobes. In Hyopsodus the 

 contiguous horns of the crescentoid summits of the outer lobes 

 conjoin in the antero-internal lobe, and tlie anterior horn of the 

 crescentoid summit of the antero-external lobe ends at the base 

 of the antero-internal lobe. In Microsyops the anterior horn of 

 the crescentoid summit of the antero-external lobe ends in a tujjer- 

 cle in front of the antero-internal lobe, while its posterior horn 

 ends in the latter; but the anterior horn of the postero-external 

 lobe, instead of joining the antero-internal lobe, as in Hyopsodus, 

 ends at the base of the antero-external lobe. The character of 

 these teeth leads me to the belief that the jaw specimens referred 

 to Microsyops belong to the same animal as that named Hyopso- 

 dus gracilis by Prof Marsh, and with this view I propose the 

 name of Microsyops gracilis, which may be used in either case, 

 whether the animal is or is not the same as Hyopsodus gracilis. 



Two additional specimens I suppose belong to an insectivorous 

 animal, though the}^ may perhaps indicate a small marsupial. 

 Thej^ were obtained, b^' Dr. Carter, at Lodge-pole Trail, W\'oming. 

 One of the specimens, an upper jaw fragment, contains a molar 

 tooth. This resembles the back molars of the Opossum, but with 

 the outer lobes of the crown proportionately better developed, and

the median lobes reduced to a minute condition. A strong liasal 

 ridge bounds the cro^vn externally, a thin one anteriorly, and 

 a strong festoon-like portion at the bottom of the inner lobe pos- 

 teriorly. The second specimen, an isolated tooth, is a diminished 

 representative of the one described. It may be a last upper or 

 other premolar of the same animal, or a corresponding true molar of 

 a smaller species. AVc have no means of determining the proba- 

 bility of these specimens belonging either to Omomys or Triaco- 

 do7}, and I propose to name the animal to -vvhich the}' pertained 

 raJpeoeodon veriia. The larger tooth is 2 lines fore-and-aft, and 2^ 

 lines transversely; the smaller one is 1^ lines fore-and-aft, and 2 

 lines transversely.

SYNOPSIS OF THE SPECIES OF THE CHELYDRIN^. 



BY E. D. COPE, A.M. 



This group of tortoises, so far as their structure is exactly 

 known, is confined to Nortli and Tropical America. The number 

 of species is small, though the present list adds several to those 

 previously known. Their structure is highl}'- interesting, as ex- 

 pressing relationship to groups which existed during mesozoic 

 time. I allude to the family of Propleuridse, found in the creta- 

 ceous greensand of New Jersey, which possessed features of the 

 sea-turtles, combined with those of the present group, or the 

 snappers. The latter possess the imperfect and small plastron 

 of the Propleuridse^ conjoined with the ambulatory limbs of the 

 Emydidse. In other respects they resemble the Emydidas, and 

 I am inclined, until further discoveries of structural peculiarities 

 shall have been made, to allow them to remain in that family, 

 although both Dr. Gray and Prof. Agassiz have referred them to 

 a distinct one, under the name of Chelydidde. Certain it is, that 

 they are also related to the Cinosternidae^ which is peculiar in the 

 absence of the mesosternal bone. Claudius approaches the latter 

 family in its short tail and lack of posterior vertebral bones. 



The only possible exception to the rule of distribution above 

 laid down, is the genus Platy sternum^ Gra}', from eastern Asia. 

 This form has been placed here, but appears to associate them 

 with more typical Emydidae ; until its structure be better known, 

 its position will remain doubtful. 



The vertebrieof Chelydra serpentina \)rQ^&nX some peculiarities 

 as compared with Trionyx Testudo and Emys, as follows: — 



Testudo jyolyphemus. Cervical vertebr?e 2-3 and 4 opistlioca?lian, 4tli bi- 

 convex, remainder proccelian. Caudal vertebra; all procceliau. 



Trionyx fer ox. Cervical vertebrae all opisthocoelian, caudals all proccelian. 



Cheloptis guttatus. Cervical vertebrae as in Testudo, the balls of the poste- 

 rior transverse bilobed ; caudals all proccelian. 



Chelydra serpentina. Cervicals as in Testudo; the caudals all opistlioca?lian. 



There are only three well-ascei'tained genera of this family-, to 

 which a fourth may perhaps be added. They are distinguished 

 as follows : —

think the identifications must be reconsidered, and one of the 

 names originally proposed b}' himself {C. megalocephalua)^ be 

 retained. The species are thus distinguished : — 



I. Inguinal scuta two. 

 Shell depressed, broad, carina? very weak ; one long anal plate ; inguinals 

 transverse ; tail smooth ; head brown, shielded above to behind the eyes. 



C. SEVERUS. 



Shell with three elevated keels, the carapace emarginate between the anal 

 scuta ; one short anal plate ; inguinals longitudinal ; tail with four rows 

 of tubercles ; head white spotted above, brown spotted below. 



C. PICTUS. 



II. Inguinal scuta one or wanting. 



Head very wide, smooth above ; two anal scuta ; lobes of plastron sub- 

 similar ; dorsal keel grooved. C. megalocephalus. 



Head narrower, with a horny shield on the top of the nose ; posterior lobe 

 of plastron narrower and more acute than anterior ; dorsal keel simple. 



C. AXGUSTATUS. 



CLAUDIUS SEVERUS, Cope, sp. nov. 

 Carapace an elongate oval, with convex sides; the upper sur- 

 face nearly plane in profile, rising anteriorly, sloping to the an- 

 terior margin, and descending rather abruptly to the posterior. 

 General form rather depressed, the middle line including the entire 

 width of the vertebral scuta below the level of the proximal part 

 of the costals. The latter present an obtuse longitudinal carina 

 on the two median. The two central vertebral scuta also possess 

 a weak keel, of which a trace appears anteriorly on the fifth or 

 last; first and second flat. The scutal sutures bounding the ver- 

 tebrals, costals, and marginals (except those between the last) 

 are bounded b}' flat but marked grooves of the shell. Thus a 

 continuous band-like groove extends round the carapace above the 

 marginal bones, and is continuous with a similar one passing 

 along the anterior margin of each costal, and undulate grooves 

 along the margins of the vertebrals. The first costal is one-fourth 

 longer than the second. The vertebrals are hexagonal, longer 

 than broad, with a rounded notch behind and projection in front. 

 The first is narrowed urceolate, deepl}' notched behind, and mar- 

 o-ining nearly half the first marginal in front. The nuchal is 

 broad transversel}", and very narrow; the anterior one narrower 

 than the posterior. The last and penultimate are a little wider, 



[April 16, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 25 



tlie last joining the last costal b}- a very short suture. The mar- 

 gin of the carapace is regular without notch behind or elsewhere. 

 The plastron is small, rather broad, and rounded in front, and 

 much contracted and acute behind. The bridge is rather wider 

 tlian in C. a)HiHt>fa(us, and more as in Chehjdra. The anterior 

 lobe is immovable in the dried specimen. Pectoro-abdominal 

 suture transverse, length of pectoral on median suture equal 

 abdominal and two-thirds femoral length, and equal to that of 

 the anal. Latter much longer than wide. The abdominal plate 

 is the onl}- one which covers the bridge from within, but does not 

 extend quite half-wa}^ across. Each is met by two large ingui- 

 nals, which are broadly in contact with each other, and are 

 broader than long. 



The color of the carapace is brown, but wherever rubbed of a 

 wax-3-ollow. The marginals at the bridge are principally a 

 strong yellow, which color covers the whole of the plastron. 



The soft parts are preserved in alcohol. The head is large for 

 the size of the carapace, and is remarkably- broad, and with rather 

 short muzzle. This projects, however, much be3-ond the mouth, 

 the end of the under jaw visible when closed, being scarcely 

 beyond the margin of the orbit. Beak short, obtuse, not dentate; 

 an obtuse festoon of the tomia below the orbit. Two beards. 

 Head covered with skin above, except from the line of the poste- 

 rior margin of the orbits to the end of the muzzle, which is pro- 

 tected by an undivided horn}' plate. 



The skin is but slightly granular. There are five curved scuta 

 on the inner side of each fore foot, and a single row of scuta 

 above on each digit. The fore feet are webbed to the bases of the 

 ungues. The hind feet are well palmate, and with a free outer 

 web supported by a clawless toe. There are six curved scuta 

 on the inferior outer face of the base of the lower leg, of which 

 the first and third reach the external margin, and the others are 

 more internal except the lowest, which is very small. The tail is 

 very short, depressed, and incurved, with a terminal compressed 

 corneous scale. It is smooth, or without tubercles, nl)ovc and 

 below, but anterior to the anus above arc three pairs of very 

 small tubercles, one on each side of the median line. 



Color of soft parts dirty wiiite below, dark brown above; sides 

 of head with close yellow reticulations behind. Throat and 

 lower jaw yellow; a dark spot <m each side of the symphysis con-

 and sent by him to the collections of' the Smithsonian Institu- 

 tion. (Coll. No. 485.) I am indebted to the secretarj^. Prof. 

 Henry, for the opportunity of making an examination of it. 

 Prof. Sumichrast says of it in his notes, that it is rare, and only 

 lives in muddy pools. In the j'oung the dorsal crests are more 

 distinct. During life the anterior lobe of the sternum possesses 

 a slight mobility, which disappears on drying.

Staurotypiis salvinii^ Bocourt, Miss. Sci. Mex. Eept. 22, tab. v., fig. 3, 

 1870; nee Grayii Proc. Z. S. Lond., 1864. 



This fine species has been identified by MM. Dum^ril and Bo- 

 court with the species described by Dr. Gray, as above cited; but 

 it appears to me to be very distinct and perhaps pertinent to 

 another genus. Dr. Gray describes the anterior lobe of the ster- 

 num in S. salvinii as narrowed like the posterior, while it is 

 broadly rounded in this animal. He also states that in his species 

 the tail has a median crest of compressed tubercles, as in ChC' 

 lydra, with a lateral series on each side. In this species there are 

 four series of minute warts, as in the other Claudii, and in no 

 way resembling those of Chelydra. This is evidently not Gray's 

 species, and it remains to compare it with the Claudii, and espe- 

 cially with C. severus. It differs from this tortoise in the cara- 



[June 25, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 27 



pace with more neavl}- parallel sides, with three stronger or more 

 elevated keels above. It differs in the possession of an emargi- 

 nation between the anal scuta. The plastron differs in the shorter 

 and less acuminate posterior lo])e with shorter bridge. The 

 femoral scuta extend behind the abdominals on the bridge, while 

 the latter cover its entire width in C. j^icf^is. The infra-marginal 

 plates are longer than wide in this species; in C.x>ictns they are 

 transverse. The tail of this species exhibits the nsual four rows 

 of tubercles, while in G. severus it is smooth. The head is nar- 

 rower in C. pictus, and the colors more varied. Thus the top of 

 the head is pale spotted on a brown ground, the jaws are 3'ellow 

 with brown cross-bands; a yellowish band extends from their 

 angle over the tympanum to the side of the neck. Carapace j^el- 

 lowish-brown with a dark brown spot on the posterior part of 

 each scutum ; limbs brown above ; plastron 3-ellow with a brown 

 spot on each scutum. Length of carapace, .136 m.

 Miss. Sci. Mex. Zool. Kept., p. 20, tab. iv. 



This species and the G. angusfadis constitute the tj'pical and 

 smaller forms of the genus, distinguished b}' the very slender 

 bridge of the plastron and single inguinal or intermarginal. The 

 present animal, after being described as distinct by Bocourt, was 

 subsequently referred to the longer described G. a7igus!a(us, but I 

 am disposed to regard his first conclusion as the more correct, 

 having received from Sumichrast a second specimen of the latter, 

 whicli confirm its characters. 



In G. megalocejjhalus, according to Bocourt, the head is verj' 

 wide and the muzzle short, with hooked beak. Its upper surface 

 does not display the oval horny scute seen in G. anfjuslahoi, and 

 though there is a convexity of the edge of the maxilla below the 

 front of the orbit, it is not an acute tooth as in the tj-pe of G. 

 angustalus. This appearance may perhaps be due to age. 



The carapace is three keeled above, the median keel ri.s.surcd in 

 its length. The keels traverse all the costal and vertebral scuta, 

 except perhaps the last vertebral. The plastron is rather wide 

 with the anterior lobe a little longer; neither lobe is much uar-

This species is rather more slender than the last; the head is 

 narrower, and the posterior lobe of the plastron narrower and 

 more acute. The horny plate on the nose, and the undivided 

 dorsal keel, constitute other distinctions, the last of which are 

 noticed by Bocourt. In one of our specimens there is a single 

 anal scutum, in another there are two. 



STAUEEMYS, Gray. 



Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1864, p. 127 ; Supplement to Catal. Shield Rep., 



1870, p. 65, f. 22. 



This name was applied by Dr. Gray as a subdivision of Stauro- 

 typus, Wagl., which belongs to the Kinosternidse, a family defined 

 by the absence of the mesosternal bone. If this arrangement 

 expresses the true affinities of the species referred to it, it is un- 

 necessary to introduce it here. Dr. Gray states that the anterior 

 lobe of the sternum is movable as in Staurotypus ti'iporcatus, hut 

 is more acute than in that species, being in this respect like the 

 posterior lobe. This difference is only specific, and the supposed 

 genus Stauremys, as defined by Gray, would not appear to stand 

 on any foundation. Should, however, it turn out to embrace a 

 species of Chelydrinae, it will rest on the character given above, 

 as distinguishing it from Claudius, viz., the movable anterior lobe 

 of the sternum. M. Bocourt appears to believe it to be one of 

 this group, from his referring to it a species of Claudius {G. 

 pictus, Cope), and as he may be correct, I introduce it into the 

 present synopsis. 



Dr. Gray's descriptions render it plain that the only known 

 species is quite distinct from those described above.

ON AN EXTINCT WHALE FROM CALIFOKNIA. 

 BY PROF. E. D, COPE. 



George Davidson, of the United States Coast Survey, recentl3' 

 presented the Museum of the Academy of Natural Sciences, the 

 proximal portion of the left ramus of the mandible of a whale- 

 bone whale. The specimen was found in digging a well at San 

 Diego, on the coast, in the southern part of the State, at a depth 

 of seventy-four feet below the surface, July 27th, 1871. 



The angle and condyle are broken from the specimen, and the 

 distal extremity was not preserved. It possessed a coronoid pro- 

 cess, the apex of which has been lost. The inner face is plane, 

 somewhat convex above, behind the basis of the coronoid process. 

 Anteriorly it becomes more convex, the surface turning inwards 

 to the superior and inferior margins. The exterior face is con- 

 vex, so that at the posterior foramen its diameter above the mid- 

 dle is greater than that below the middle. The inferior outline, 

 from below the coronoid process to below the last external fora- 

 men, is straight, not decurved. It is obtuse most of this distance, 

 but becomes narrowed at the anterior point. The superior mar- 

 gin is obtuse anteriorly, narrowed acute for ten inches anterior 

 to the coronoid process ; it is not truncate anteriorl}-. The internal 

 foramina are large, and form a series below the ui)per margin, 

 without distinct groove. The external foraminal series termi- 

 nates much anterior to the interior, that is, the last external is 

 opposite the sixth from behind of the inner row. There is no in- 

 ternal Meckelian groove. The Meckelian cavity of the ramus is 

 large behind the coronoid, but small and in the upper part of the 

 ramus at the last exterior foramen. Tlie dental foramen is large 

 and above the base of the Meckelian cavity, to that its inner 

 wall descends to the floor of the latter. Below the l)ase of the

The presence of coronoid process indicates that the present 

 species was a finner, and allied to Balaenojjtera. Though there 

 are no vertebrfe or other elements to determine its reference to 

 this genus or to its all^' Eachi^ichtius^ it may be proper to refer it 

 provisionally to the latter genus, since so many of its allies on 

 the Atlantic coast formations have been found to be referable to 

 it. This course is still more appropriate from the fact that the 

 strata of tertiary age near San Diego are reported to be of mio- 

 cene age, the same in which the eastern Eschrichtii have been 

 found. As to its specific characters, these differ entirely from 

 those of the latter. The ramus lacks the decurA'ature of most of 

 them. In size it approaches nearest the E.pohjporus^^ Cope, and 

 E. 2mscus, Leidy. It is much less convex externally than the 

 latter. The exterior series of pores does not extend so far poste- 

 riorly as in E. polyporus, and the dental foramen has a superior 

 position, besides other differences. Size that of E. j^riscus. 



The species may bear the name of its discoverer, and be called 

 EscHRicHiTus DAviDSONii, in rccollcction of the efforts of George 

 Davidson to aid the cause of science in various ways. 



This whale, when living, probably attained a length of about 

 forty feet.

ON NUMERICAL ORDER IN THE BRANCHING OF SOME CONIFER^:. 

 BY THOMAS MEEHAN. 



In a paper entitled " Adnation in Coniferre,'" read at the 

 Ciiicago meeting of the American Association for the Advance- 

 ment of Science, and which was published in the "Proceedings'' 

 for 1868, I pointed out that the true leaves of Coniferie were 

 mostly adherent to the stem — not merelj' "decurrcnt" as is 

 usually said of some of them ; and that the vigor of the axis or 

 stem was the measure of the adhesion. I now propose to show 

 that axial vigor also determines the law of branching in some 

 cases, and that the branching is on a numerical plan. 



In the most vigorous growths of Thuja occidentalism the com- 

 mon American arbor vitn?, the leaves are almost wholly united 

 with the axis, only the delicate sharp awns are free. Tliese are 

 arranged in pairs, one leaf opposite the other. The upper pair 

 alternates with tlic lower (decussate). A branch appears at tiie 

 eighth node ; and always at the eighth node when the vigor of 

 the branch remains the same. As the axis weakens the branches 

 appear at the sixth node. This is the general average. With 

 greater weakness the fourth node gives birth to the branch ; and 

 finally as the plant takes on its froudose flattened form, a branch 

 pushes from every alternate node. But in no case does a branch 

 push at an odd number. They are always from the second, fourtli, 

 sixth, or eighth node. 



In Tlntja gigantea, Nutt., the same law prevails, tlie sixth 

 and eightii being more numerous. 



In Lihocedrus decurrens all appear to be on the alternate plan. 

 I have seen no instance, even in vigorous shoots, where the 

 branches push otherwise than from every second node. This is 

 also true of Chamren/pari^ Laxosoniana^ Pari.; and of (.'. ohluxa^ 

 Sieb., G. jrisifera, and C. retusa—aW probably varieties of one

produce frondose branches, the numerical order is lost: bi'anchlets 

 push at any indefinite point along the stem. 



In Ghamsecy parts sphaeroidea, Spach., the American white 

 cedar, the branching is pretty regular at the fourth node, some- 

 times from the second, rarely from the fifth. 



In Ghamsecyparis nulpaensis, Spach., the yellow cedar of the 

 Pacific Coast, the course is the same as in the American arbor 

 vitae. 



Sometimes in very stout shoots of this plant the leaves will be 

 in whorls of three. It is curious to note then that the branching 

 is on the odd numbers; either at three, five, or so on; but yet not 

 in a regular graded series as in its normal condition and in the 

 arbor vitoes. I have counted as man}- as fifteen nodes without a 

 branch, and this absence of order in branching also exists in 

 junipers. In these the leaves are mostly in threes, though still 

 decussate, and the branching takes place at the odd numbers, and 

 is irregular. 



Gallitris qiiadrivalvis has four leaves in a whorl, and here again 

 we have the irregular branching of the junipers. 



The result of these observations is that in a large number of 

 cases the frequencj^ of branching is in company with declining 

 vigor ; that presence of leaves in an opposite pair is favorable to 

 a regularity'' of branching on even numbers; and that whorls of 

 three or more are associated with irregular branching on odd 

 numbei's. 



It is proper to remark that this branching has reference to the 

 growth of one season. There are axillar}' dormant buds at every 

 node, which maj^ push according to circumstances during any 

 subsequent year. 



In connection with this subject are some observations worthy 

 of note, though not probably original. As soon as the branching 

 at alternate nodes begins in Libocedrus, Thuja, Biota, and others, 

 the frondose character commences. The pair of adated leaves 

 just above the node which bore a branch, is much contracted. 

 These are always on the upper and lower faces, and are known as 

 the dorsal leaves. The next pair of leaves are more developed, 

 more free from cohesion with the axis, and from one of them a 

 branchlet usually springs. Tiiese are the marginal leaves. 

 Usually the branchlets, one from a node and from every second 

 node, are alternate Avith the ones above and below it ; but when 



[June 25, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 35 



the branchlet pushes from the main branch, the first series of two 

 or sometimes three are one above another, and on the upper side. 

 The flattened froudose form is the result of this plan of develop- 

 ment. Rarely two branchlets will proceed from each node, one 

 from the axil of each opposite leaf. 



In some species each succeeding pair of cohering leaves are 

 of equal length and strength. In the Thujas and in Chamse- 

 cyparis Lamsoniana this is characteristic; but in Libocedrus 

 decurrens, and Chameecyparis obhisa, and allies, every first pair 

 succeeding a branchlet, and which on the flattened conditions 

 constitute the dorsal pair, are very much abbreviated and 

 shortened, so much indeed as to scarcely proceed beyond the line 

 of the lower pair, and thus some writers have been led to describe 

 these plants as having 4-verticillate leaves. 



The seedling or first j-ear's growth of Biota orientalis exhibits 

 this subverticillate character. The first pair of leaves succeeding 

 the cotyledons is so near as to appear almost two of a series of 

 four cot^-ledon lobes. For many successive nodes the leaves 

 appear to be 4-verticillate. 



In regard to the early leaves of coniferous plants, those which 

 folloAv the cotyledons are nearl}' free, having little cohesion with 

 the stem or "decurrence," as botanists sa}'. As the axis becomes 

 thicker, or, as I have termed it in the paper referred to, endowed 

 with more vitality, there is less of the free portion and more of 

 the adnated or cohering, until in Finns there is nothing left but 

 a thickened bed or pidxiinus ; and the axial bud which generally 

 marks the diverging place of the proper leaf has to push and in 

 a difficult way perform the function of leaves. If any thing tend 

 to check the vitality of the tree, so that the axial buds do not 

 develop, the adnating power is weakened, and the true leaves 

 again become free from the stem. This is seen in Pimis edulis, 

 Engl. At an}' time through its existence, where the branches arc 

 weak by being shaded or starved by other branches, the pulvini 

 develop into true leaves, and the axial bud, usually producing 

 two " needles," does not push. Street trees and osier willows wlicn 

 annually trimmed, though the subsequent growth is vigorous, 

 increase their trunks slowly in girth, and die much earlier than 

 nncut ones. Thus their vitality is impaired. iSome i)iiio trees 

 when cut down push up strong sprouts, and those will ot'tfii have 

 the pulvini developed into true leaves as in the weakened I'inus 

 1872.1 




36 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



edulis. I have shown already, in the paper before referred to, 

 that Thujopsis horealis {Chamsecyparis^ Nutkaensis, Spach.) also 

 throws out free leaves always in the weakened cutting state. In 

 some garden varieties of Thuja and Biota the weak axis of the 

 seedling condition remains throughout many succeeding years of 

 growth. In all these cases the leaves are free. These free leaved 

 forms are still regarded by some excellent European botanists as 

 species of unknown introduction, although, as stated in my paper 

 on " Adnation in Conifera," their derivation from Thuja and Biota 

 is founded on direct evidence. I refer to this incidental matter 

 chiefly to add the new observation, in connection with the leading 

 points of the present paper, that with their weakened condition, 

 the regular numerical order of branching, as noted in the fully 

 developed forms, does not exist. 



I do not suppose this law of vital vigor so far as developed will 

 account for all the phenomena of free or adnated leaves; or for 

 all the numerical relations of branchlets to the nodes. I have 

 myself pointed out some apparent exceptions, but I trust I have 

 made it clear that it performs no mean part in the order of these 

 thinos.

The following paper was presented for publication : — 



" Descriptions and Illustrations of Genera of Shells." By T. A. 

 Conrad. 



Remarks on some Extinct Mammals. — Prof. Leidy exhibited 

 specimens of fossils from the Tertiary of Wyoming. One of these 

 is an upper jaw fragment with two molars ; the other a lower jaw 

 fragment with a single molar. The upper molars have crowns 

 composed of four lobes, of which the outer are like the corres- 

 ponding ones in Anchitherium. Of the inner lobes, the front one 

 is much the larger, and is prolonged outwardl}' in advance of the 

 antero-external lobe. It is homologous with the antero-internal 

 and antero-median lobes as existing in Anchilherium^ in a com- 

 jDletely connate condition. The postero-internal lobe is the smallest 

 of the crown. It is conical and conjoins that in front. A barely 

 perceptible trace of a postero-median lobe is seen. A strong basal 

 ridge incloses the crown, except externally, where it is feebly 

 produced. 



The three upper molars occupied a space of 8 lines. The first 

 molar is 2i lines fore and aft and 3j transversely ; the second is 

 2| lines fore and aft, and the last one 2^ lines. 



A question arises as to whether these teeth pertain to any of 

 the animals previousl}' indicated from lower jaw specimens with 

 teeth. They are too large for tlie known species of llyopsodn^ or 

 Microsyops. They nearly accord in size with the lower molars of 

 NolJia7-(fu.<, and perhaps belong to this genus. Linnolhrrium 

 appears not to dilfer from this, as the number of teeth and their 

 constitution are the same. 



The lower jaw fragment accompanying the upper one may be- 

 long to the same animal. The molar it contains, tliough resomhliug 

 those of No(ha7'dits^ dilfei's in several points. I propose to refer 

 the fossils to a species with the name of IIipposyus formosis. 



Prof. Leidy further remarked that he had recently the oppoi- 

 tunity of examining the tooth described by Prof. Marsh under the 

 name of Palaosijops minor. The tooth evidenlly l)elongs to the 

 curious pachyderm with the beaver-like incisors named Tr(i(/<>sii.< 

 casfuridtns. On observing the molar tooth, which is not worn awny 

 like those in the jaw specimen upon which the latter was named, 

 it at once called to mind, the tooth which had i)een deseribed 

 under the name of Aiic/iippodu.s ripnrius. On comparison, it 

 would appear as if the specimens referred to I'alitosyops ininvr 

 1872.J 




38 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



aud Trogosus casforidens, really belong to the same genus and 

 species. The tooth of AncJnppodus riparius was obtained from 

 a tertiary formation, miocene or eocene, in Monmouth Co., N. J. 

 If the determination is correct, it would go to show that the Brid- 

 ger Tertiary formation of Wyoming was contemporaneous with 

 the Tertiary deposit of Monmouth Co., N. J. 



Prof. Cope stated that the largest mammal of the Eocene for- 

 mations adjoining those of W3'oming, 1 e. of the Wahsatch group 

 of Hayden, was the Bathmodon radians^ Cope, of about the size 

 of Rhinocerus. It was an odd-toed ungulate, with peculiar dental 

 characters. The incisors were well developed above and below 

 as in the Tapir, but the dental series was little interrupted. The 

 crowns of the upper molars were all wider than long, and presented 

 mixed characters. On the outer margin one only of the two 

 usual crescents of Ruminants was present, but a tubercle repre- 

 sented the anterior one. The one wliicli was present was di- 

 rected very obliquely inwards. Inner crescents were represented 

 by two angles, the posterior forming the inner angular margin of a 

 flat table, the anterior, a mere cingulum at its anterior base. The 

 arrangement of these parts was stated to be of interest in connec- 

 tion with the relationships between the types of hoofed animals. 

 The single outer crescent was a ruminant indication, while the 

 inner table resembled the interior part of the crown of Titanothe- 

 rium. It differed, however, in its early union with the outer mar- 

 gin, its edge being thus possibl}^ homologous Avith the posterior 

 transverse crest in Rhinocerus. Tlie premolars had two or three 

 lobes with crescentic section arranged transversel3^ He regarded 

 the genus as allied to Chalicofherium. 



He stated that the mammalian fauna of Wyoming and Utah 

 more nearly resembled that of tlie Paris Basin than any yet dis- 

 covered in our country, and that it had been discovered to con- 

 tain a still greater number of generalized mammalian forms. One 

 of the most marked of these was the genus just described by Dr. 

 Leidy.

Remarks on some Extinct Vertebrates. — Prof. Leidy directed at- 

 tention to some fossils upon which he made the following obser- 

 vations. Several teeth and jaw fragments from the Loup Fork of 

 the Niobrara River, Nebraska, obtained b}^ Prof. Hayden, appear 

 to indicate a large species of Felis, not previously desci'ibed. 

 The most characteristic specimen consists of an upper sectorial 

 molar about as large as that of the Bengal Tiger, and consequently 



[June 25, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 39 



mucli too large for either of the largest existing american cats, 

 the Panther and the Jaguar. It is as much too small to have 

 pertained to the American hiou, Felis afrox^ for its breadth is l)ut 

 slightly greater than that contained in the lower jaw from which 

 the latter was described. Breadth of the crown of the tooth is 15^ 

 lines; its thickness in front 8 lines. The measurements in the 

 corresponding teeth of a Bengal Tiger are, 16 lines in breadth, 

 and Ti lines in thickness in front. The form of the fossil tooth is 

 the same as in the other feline species. 



The extinct species may be named Felis Augustus. 



A distal extremity of a humerus, from the Niobrara River, about 

 the size and construction of the corresponding part in the Bengal 

 Tiger, ma}- belong to this species. 



Another fossil, consisting of a detached body of a vertebra, ap- 

 parently indicates an extinct reptile allied to Fl('.-<iOfiaHrus and 

 Discosaurus. The specimen, recent!}- received from Prof. Ilayden, 

 was obtained in 1870, on Henry's Fork of Green River, AVyoming. 

 It is free from attaclied matrix, and was the only specimen ))ertain- 

 ing to the animal which was found. It probabl}' belonged to a for- 

 mation of earlier date tlian tliat of the same locality wliicli has 

 yielded other fossils previously described. 



The vertebra is from the base of the tail, and is much sliorter iu 

 relation to its otiier dimensions than in Fle>;iosai(riis or Discosau- 

 rus. The extremities are concave, and encircled near the margin 

 of the articular surfaces with a narrow groove. Posteriorly there 

 are two large articular facets, as widely separated as the bone 

 would permit, for the junction of a chevron. Anteriorly there are 

 no marks of clievron attachment. The roots of strong transverse 

 processes or diapophyses i)roject from the sides of the body just 

 above the middle. The neural arch was completely co-ossified 

 with the body, leaving no trace of its earlier separation. 



The breadth of the body is 23 lines ; its depth 111 lines, and its 

 length 1 inch. 



"N'iewingthe specimen as probably representing a genus different 

 from those mentioned, I propose to name it with the si)ecies as 

 Oligosimus graxd.evus. 



Another fossil is a remarkable specimen, obtained by Prof. 

 Ilayden in the " Black Foot country" at the head of the Missouri 

 River. It looks as if it had formed part of the dermal armor of 

 some huge saurian or perhaps of an armadillo-like animal. It is 

 imperfect, and looks as if it were half broken away. In its pre- 

 sent state it is liemiovoid, al)out two inches in diameter. <f)ucavc 

 below, and convex above, where it is covered by about fifteen 

 large mannniliar}- l)osses. 



Accompanying this specimen there is a distal iihahmx, which 

 ma\' belong to the same animal. It is rather less tiian two inciies 

 long. The articular surface is transversely elliptical, l.{ incli 

 wide, and 11 lines deep, anil feeljly depressed, so as to indicate a

moderate degree of mobility. The upper surface of the bone slopes 

 to the end and is transversely convex. The extremity is expanded 

 at the borders. Beneath are several vascular perforations. 

 Though the specimens are not sufficiently characteristic to deter- 

 mine positivel}' whether they belong to a mammal or a reptile, or 

 whether they even belong together to the same animal, the former 

 one is so peculiar that I am disposed to regard it as representing 

 a genus and species, which may be named Tylosteus ornatus. 



Curious habit of a Snake. — Mr. Cope made the following re- 

 marks : — 



I had for some time a specimen of Cyclophis seslivus, received 

 from Fort Macon, N. Ca., through the kindness of Dr. Yarrow, 

 living in a wardian case. Tlie slender form of this snake, and 

 its beautiful green and 3'ellow colors, have led to the opinion 

 that it is of arboreal or bush-loving habits. It never exhibited 

 such in conftnement, however, and instead of climbing over the 

 Caladia, ferns, etc., lived mostly under ground. It had a curi- 

 ous habit of projecting its head and two or three inches of its 

 body above the ground, and holding them for hours rigidly in a 

 fixed attitude. In this position it resembled very closel3' a sprout 

 or shoot of some green succulent plant, and might readily be mis- 

 taken for such b}' small animals. 



Intelligence in Monkeys. — I have two species of Cebus in my 

 study, C cajnicinus, and a half-grown C. a2:>eUa. The former 

 displays the usual traits of monkej- ingenuity'. He is an admirable 

 catcher, seldom missing anything, from a large brush to a grain, 

 using two hands or one. His cage door is fastened by two hooks, 

 and these are kept in their places by nails driven in behind them. 

 He generally finds means sooner or later to draw out the nails, 

 unhook the hooks and get free. He then occupies himself in 

 breaking up various objects and examining their interior appear- 

 ances, no doubt in search of food. To prevent his escape I 

 fastened him by a leather strap to the slats of the cage, but he 

 soon untied the knot, and then relieved himself of the strap by 

 cutting and drawing out the threads which held the flap for the 

 buckle. He then used the strap in a novel wa}'. He was accus- 

 tomed to catch his food (bread, i^otatoes, fruit, etc.) with his 

 hands, when thrown to him. Sometimes the pieces fell short 

 three or four feet. One day he seized his strap and began to 

 throw it at the food, retaining his hold of one end. He took 

 pretty correct aim, and finally drew the pieces to within reach of 

 his hand. This performance he constantly repeats, hooking and 

 pulling the articles to him in turns and loops of the strap. Some- 

 times he loses his hold of the strap. If the poker is handed him, 

 he uses that with some skill, for the recover}- of the strap. When 

 this is drawn in, he secures his food as before. Here is an act of 



[June 25, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 41 



intelligence which must have been originated b}- some monkey, 

 since no lower or ancestral t3pe of ^lammals possess the hands 

 necessary for its accomplishment. Whether originated b}- Jack, 

 or by some ancestor of the forest who used vines for the same 

 purpose, cannot be readily- ascertained. 



After a punishment, the animal would only exert himself in 

 this way when not watched ; as soon as an e3'e was directed to 

 him, he would cease. In this he displayed distrust. He also 

 usually exhibited the disposition to accumulate to be quite su- 

 perior to hunger. Thus he always appropriated all the food with- 

 in reach before beginning to eat. When different pieces were 

 offered to him, he transferred the first to his hind feet to make 

 room for more ; then filled his mouth and hands, and concealed 

 portions behind him. With a large piece in his hands, he would 

 pick the hand of his master clean before using his own, which he 

 was sure of.

Prof P. Frazer, Jr., noticed agranular sediment at tlie l)ottom 

 of several bottles of water from the Geyser Spring, Saratoga, 

 and on taking them out the^^ proved to be phancro-crystallinc 

 individuals of peculiar form. This form seemed at first sight to 

 be that of the sphenoid or wedge-shaped hemi-pyramitls of one of 

 the tetragonal or rliombic systems. On testing the crystals they 

 proved to be nothing else tlian carbonate of lime, and the dilll- 

 cult3' lay in making tiieir hal»itus and comp<isition harmonize. 

 Arragonite crystals they certainly were not, and if they were cal- 

 cites it is evident that they could not be sphenoids.

42 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



On a closer examination it turned out tliat they were acute 

 rhomlDohedrons witli four planes largely and the other tAvo planes 

 only very minutely developed, thus giving to the crystal the ap- 

 pearance* of a tetrahedron or sphenoid, two of whose angles were 

 truncated by small planes. 



It suggested itself as a means of obtaining crystals from a 

 saturated carbonic acid solution of those substances not readily 

 soluble in pure water, to allow the gas to escape uniformly but 

 slowly, and thus allow each crystal time to complete its comple- 

 ment of planes.

Permission being granted, Dr. H. Allen called attention to a 

 novel method of studying the appendicular skeleton of vertebrates. 

 He had found that a radiated arrangement of bones could be de- 

 tected in the shoulder girdle. The recognition of such a plan sug- 

 gested the propriety of characterizing rays as divergent from a 

 hypothetized centre with respect to their positions to the longi- 

 tudinal axis of the bod3\ The scapula thus becomes the neurad; 

 the pre-coracoid and coracoid bones the heamad; while the ra}' of 

 the arm is the manad. The neurad ray is single and may seg- 

 ment twice, as in some batrachians, or but once, as in others of 

 the same class. The heamad rays never segment. They may be 

 single or double. The manad rays are multiple in fishes, and may 

 not diverge from a single point. In Gobius some of these rays 

 appear as actinapophyses to the neurad rays. 



The manad rays are single in other vertebrates. They do not 

 segment in fishes, but may twice segment ("glenoid"-brachium) 

 with other forms. It is necessary to remember that the centre of 

 this radiate arrangement is not at all times at the slioulder-joint, 

 but ma}^ be at a point at which the "glenoid" (Parker) scapular, 

 pre-coracoid, and coracoid bones converge. This is instanced in 

 man and the salamander. 



The study of the pelvic girdle yields similar results to those 

 above stated. The centre here is at the acetabulum. The neurad 

 ray (ilium), tlie two heamads (pubis and ischium), as well as the 



[June 25, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 43 



pesad (femur) do not segment. The late Y-shaped ossification 

 (man) is without morphological value. 



Dr. A. endeavored to establish a plan for the construction of the 

 hand and foot, b}' premising a system of divergent ra3's project- 

 ing from the distal extremity of the manad and pedad segments 

 respective!}'. He conceived it to present a better principle of 

 action than does the hypothesis of Gegenbaur, which rests upon 

 marginal chains of ossicles appended distad to the limb. 



In the fish tlie primal divergence of the rays from the multiple 

 manad are infinite, and do not permit of subsequent divergences. 

 In all other vertebrates the primal divergence is finite (single), 

 and the subsequent divergences var}-; they attain their maximum 

 number (four) in the carpus and tarsus of Ichthyosaurus and 

 Plesiosaurus. 



In taking thelimbsofthe salamander' as illustrations, it is found 

 that the humerus gives off at the elbow two rays, the ulna and 

 radius. The ulna at the wrist gives off two ra3's in the shape of 

 carpal bones, which are serially homologous with the radius and 

 ulna. Tlie lateral {i. e. outer) ra}^ segments three limes to pro- 

 duce the outer toe. The median (i. e. inner) ray segments once 

 and then yields divergents to produce by serial segmentation the 

 toes placed median to the axis of the carpal quantity. The radius 

 does not present divergents but segments to project the inner- 

 most toe. In this arrangement the ulna is seen to be the more 

 potential of the divergents of the humerus, since its several diver- 

 gences make up the bulk of tlie hand and account for the i)rojec- 

 tion of all the toes excepting the innermost. In the foot the fibula 

 is the more potential bone, since the area of its related divergen- 

 ces yields the bulk of the foot, asdoes the ulna in the hand. Again, 

 of tlie first ulnar divergence the median is the more potential, 

 siiK'C the lateral passes off to the outer toe, exhibiting axial repe- 

 tition of segments only. The tendency for the greater i)oti'iitialit3' 

 to be found in the median ray of any given divergence, finds an 

 api)arcnt exception in the penultimate divergence in Ivhlln/o^aurus 

 and /Ve.s«o.sa!<7-u.s, where it would appear as though the lateral ray 

 yielding the last divergence is the ouler instead of the inner side. 

 Enougli is secured, however, to modif^y tlie prevalent idea concern- 

 ing tiie ac(iuisition of toes. Conceding that the above scheme is 

 correct, it will follow, that, inasmuch as in tiie several diver- 

 gences the median rays arc favored, and the toes are tlie ultimate 

 projections of such rays, tliey may be initiated from towards 

 the centre and not always from tiie sides. It was observed, for 

 example, that in the bi-dactylous foot of the Prufeus the ubiar 

 divergent produced an axis composed of five segments to consti- 

 tute the outer toe. Tlie radial divergent repeated segments four 

 times, the terminal three comprising tlic inner toe. Now, the hand

44 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



of the Proteus is i!ri-clactylous, and it is found that the third toe 

 is the median ray of a divergence terminating the ulnar projec- 

 tion. 



In this connection reference was made to Buhl's' account of a case 

 of congenital defect in the human foot, in which four toes only 

 were present. The missing toe was the fourth, which is the median 

 terminal divergent of calcaneal side of foot ; the normal arrange- 

 ment of the human foot being as follows: The potential side 

 (tibial (?), remembering the twist of the posterior extremity, 

 caused the speaker to consider the potential side of the foot to be 

 homologous with the ulnar side of the hand) is segmented twice 

 (astragalus and scaphoid) to produce three divergents (1st, 2d, 

 and 3d metatarsals), each of which segments four times in form- 

 ing the first three toes. The outer weaker side segments "serially 

 twice (calcaneum., cuboid) to yield two divergents (4th and 5tli 

 metatarsals), which thence form the fourth and fifth toes.'^ 



The relations between the term actinapophysis and the term 

 ra}'', as used in the above descriptions, were next dwelt upon. It 

 was proposed to restrict the term actinapophysis to a segment 

 pi'ojected from the side of an axial ray, while such axial ra3'S are 

 always in themselves projections from a hypothetical non-osseous 

 centre. It follows that unless a ra}^ can be traced to such centre, 

 it cannot be considered of primal value, and l)ecomes actinapo- 

 phj'sal. In the event of the correctness of this hypothesis, many 

 of the identifications of Parker must fall. 



Actinapoph3^ses may behave like primal raj's with respect to 

 the bone from which thQj spring. The separately ossified tip to 

 the acromion process is an example. This is an interesting ex- 

 pression of an actinapophysis projecting in an opposite direc- 

 tion to the axis of its own ray. Ruge,^ in his descriptions of 

 abnormalities of the acromion, figures two disjuucted actinapo- 

 physes in the above position. They are, it was judged, the 

 two centres of ossification of the acromial tip, not co-ossified 

 axiallj', as is the rule, but placed as divergents to the primal ra}^ 



Dr. A, felt inclined to claim for such centres the name of " cen- 

 tres of nutrition," and to revert the present application of the 

 theory to Goodsir' (1845).

2 In the hand the radius (nhia, Gegenbaur) yields the scaphoid for a 

 segment, and the trapezius and trapezium as divergents (probably). The 

 ulna gives the seraihmar for a segment and magnum unciform and cunei- 

 form for divergents ; the fourth and fifth toe are secondary divergences 

 from the unciform (probably).

[Journal of a Reconnoissance made along Creek Valley, Colorado, in October and 



November, 1871.] 



Greeley, Colorado. 



Oct. 21, 1871. We leave Greeley, lat. 40° 25', long. 104° 36' 

 west, at 2^ P.M., cross Cache La Poudre Railroad, half raile east 

 of town, our course is N. 60° east. Camping in the evening below 

 the mouth of the Cache La Poudre, and on north bank of South 

 Platte River, our reconnoissance line takes us to Low Wet Creek, 

 three miles north of the river, but the total want of water in the 

 creek compels us to go to Platte River for camp. 



Altitude above the sea 45.56. Vegetation is getting more 

 stunted; the only trees and shrubs found are Populiis angulata, 

 Salix muhlenhergianal Rhus triloba, and Negundo aceroides; 

 Gerasiis serotina: while a few Cleome integrifolia, and Aster 

 Novse-Angliae? are yet in flower, and Cac/ws opuntia, covers the 

 high prairie everywhere. 



Platte River abounds in wild geese, A. canadensis ; brant, A. 

 Bernicla ; some white gulls and sooty terns. 



Oct. 22. Leave camp at 7 A.M., course N. 36° east. Travel- 

 ling to-day to reach Crow Creek for evening camp ; soil is sandy 

 and covered in every direction with prickly pear of most anno^'ing 

 thickness ; our view in every direction except west is bounded by 

 a drear}', grayish, monotonous prairie, still it is singular to see 

 what a large amount of animal life exists here. 



Three kinds of wolves, the little prairie fox Canis veJox, ante- 

 lopes, badgers, prairie dogs, two kinds of rabbits, black-tailed 

 deer were seen by us to-day at 3 P.M., in full sight of Crow Creek; 

 we find in several prairie ridges multitudes of Ostreea or Inocera- 

 mus shells, forming beds of dark, soft earth}' limestone. Reach- 

 ing Crow Creek we camp in a bend of tlie stream. 



Oct. 23. We follow Crow Creek to-daj' for nine or ten miles in 

 a course on average about N. 40° east. Water and grass scarce 

 and bad. We cross and reeross the creek to-daj', but it is dry 

 and sand}', and its banks wofully parched; at 3 P.M. finding a

water hole of gi-een slimy liquid, we camp on the west side of the 

 creek. 



While investigating the formation of the bluffs capped with 

 gravel, we Dnd man}- beautiful moss agates, and numerous flakes 

 and rude stone implements, mixed in tertiary gravel and seemingly 

 coeval with it. 



Oct. 24. Crossing Crow Creek at camp our course is N. 23° and 

 N. 11° east. 



On leaving Crow Creek I obtained a complete suite of stone im- 

 plements and rude fragments which occur mixed in a gravel and 

 sand deposit that composes the summit and sides of the low bluffs 

 on the east bank. I found them in the gravel, in the soil, in every 

 kind of position, and sometimes weather beaten or stained by 

 weather and rain. The accompan3ing gravel is composed of smooth 

 pebbles of quartzite jasper, agate, granite, mica, slate, basalt ; with 

 a few shells and fossil wood, or wood opal ; while in the low grounds 

 at the foot of the bluffs ancient fireplaces, burnt fragments of bone 

 and wood, with flint and agate, chips and implements, almost uni- 

 versally distinct from those on the summit of the low hills border- 

 ing Crow Creek; so much is this the case, that the two seem to 

 point to a distinct era, the later presenting some progress and re- 

 finement even in stone implements. 



The evidences of the oldest and rudest art do not even sliow 

 traces of Ore or fireplaces; rough implements, irregular piles of 

 pebbles, are all that is left us to show and identify to the observer 

 the obscure seat of a still more obscure barbarism. 



Another fact puzzles me, that whenever and wherever on Cache 

 La Poudre, Big Thompson River, Clear Creek, Crow Creek, and 

 Platte River, we find evidences of " Pre-aboriginal" occupation, 

 it is invariably on the low bluffs bordering these valleys, and in a 

 tertiary gravel deposit; but if we go back in the higher region 

 of the prairies, they almost disapiicar or present a diirerenec in 

 form or material. 



The shape, the location, the rude barbarism of these first 

 attempts of art irresistibly lead us to compare tliem to the rude 

 tools of Abbeville in France, or the implements of kerne in Eng- 

 land. I am glad to be able to give a few shells from this place, 

 which will serve to guide us in determining the age of the gravel 

 beds of Crow Creek. 



We are fast nearing the high talile-land, between South Platte

River, Crow Creek, and Pole Creek ; this is a dividing ridge capped 

 by conglomerate in many places, and under this on Low Wet, 

 Little Crow Creek, etc., miocene beds with Oreodon, Titanothe- 

 rium and fresh-water turtles. The gravel beds of Crow Creek 

 may be quaternary ? but they seem made up from the decomposed 

 capping north of us, and at Golden Cit}^ apparently underl}- the 

 newer tertiary beds, capped with basalt ? 



Continuing our course about N. 15° east we reach Crow Creek 

 again in the evening ; passing over a bed of lignite or tertiary 

 coal. Prairie very sandy and dry ; formation soft sandstone and 

 clay beds. 



Oct. 25. Course about IS". 11° to 17° east, following Crow Creek 

 three or four miles. I noticed in two places in the steep bluffs 

 bordering the stream the burnt stones and black carbonaceous 

 remains of old fireplaces, from four to eight feet below the present 

 surface. 



At 11 A.M. we again leave Crow Creek, and begin to cross 

 another large bend in that stream.- We are in sight of bright, 

 white bluffs north of us and directly in our course. These are the 

 white or chalk bluffs, that extend west to near the foot of the 

 black hills and on the boundary between Colorado and Wyoming 

 Territories, on the parallel of 41° jST. Antelopes abound here, 

 we saw also to-day sixteen wild horses, which at tlie first sight of 

 our men went ofi" at a rattling pace; the patriarch of the flock, a 

 fine black stallion, driving the rest before him.- 



Passing over a flat well-grassed prairie bottom we reach at 1 P.M. 

 some long low ridges, that insensibly are lost in a low flat bottom, 

 bordering a small dry affluent of Crow Creek. 



Halting here to await the arrival of the party some two miles 

 back, I strolled over the ridges to pick up specimens of agates 

 or fossils ; while so occupied I found at the foot of the first ridge 

 the evidences of the deserted site of an ancient village; the stone 

 heaps and circles, the projecting and polished boulders, the stray 

 flint tools and weapons, the multitudes of broken flakes or frag- 

 ments left in the primeval workshop ; while all around dispersed 

 in rude circles, the boulders of quartzite, of jasper}' rocks, j-ellow, 

 red, or graj^, nowhere else " in sitii,^^ speak of some method or 

 manner of industry, totally unlike our more modern Indian or 

 mound builder's vestiges. 



I made a sketch of this localitj-, marked aaa on the map, and 



[June 25, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 49 



also made a collection of the better formed implements and 

 weapons. I examined this localit}' criticall}', to get some clue to 

 its antiqnit}'. 



North, half a mile farther, another old site was reached, marked 

 by four large boulders, placed on end in some sort of rude order. 

 Crossing a small valley I reached another spot indicated by 

 similar rude monuments, and characterized by heaps of ancient 

 implements and cliiplings of the most primitive kind ; these are 

 strewn in every direction on a grassy ridge sloping down into a 

 small valle.y. The boulders Jiere and elsewhere ma3' have been 

 placed as rallying points for the family circle of the " Pre-abo- 

 riginal" man. 



Located on points of land and extended promontories, these 

 ancient sites favor strongly the idea of location near some ancient 

 estuary or fresh-water lake ; whose vestiges the present topography 

 of this region favors. 



Note on the Shells accompanying the Flints. — These represent four 

 species, three only determinable. My friend, T. A. Conrad, to whom I 

 submitted them, states that one of them is a Corbicula, the other a Rangia, 

 both estuary shells, " certainly not of later age than older Pliocene, or 

 possibly Miocene, but there is no trace of Rangia in the Eocene."— E.D.

DESCRIPTIONS AND ILLUSTRATIONS OF GENERA OF SHELLS. 

 BY T. A. CONRAD. 



CRASSATELLA, Lam. 

 Subgenus Pachyth^rtjs. 

 C. Pteropsis, Conrad, PI. I., fig. 1. Cretaceous. 

 C. Ripleyana, Conrad, fig. 7. Cretaceous. 

 C. ligeriensis, D'Orb. fig. 10. Cretaceous. 



I do not suppose this group of Cretaceous, Eocene, and Oligocene 

 shells will be recognized as a genus distinct from Crassatella, 

 and therefore I propose it as a subgenus to mark the differences 

 which characterize the species of Cretaceous and older tertiary 

 formations, and distinguish them from Miocene and recent forms. 

 For description of the subgenus, see Amer. Journ. of Conch., vol. 

 V. p. 47. 



Crassatella. 

 Miocene and recent. 

 ^. undulata, Say, Plate I., fig. 9. 



PLEUROCONCHA. 



Shell radiateljM-ibbed, hinge of right valve with 2 cardinal teeth, 

 posterior one immediately' under the apex, triangular, thick, and 

 directed obliquely posteriori}-, anterior tooth approximatel}^ direct, 

 no cartilage pit as in Crassatella. 

 Crassatella Gallieni, D'Orbigny. 



I originally proposed this genus under the objectionable name 

 of Radioconcha, and as it has not been accepted I feel at liberty 

 to alter the orthographj^ though not the meaning of the name. 



In an attempt at a natural classification of bivalves it would be 

 wrong to include this shell in the genus Crassatella, as the above 

 diagnosis must render evident to any one who studies the subject. 



In indicating the genus an error occurred in quoting the name 

 of Guerangeri, instead of Gallieni as I intended. It seems hardly 

 possible that any one could suppose that I would quote the As- 

 TARTE figured on the same plate as the type of the genus. Had 

 I done so it would have been quoted Astarte, not Crassatella. 

 G. Rohinaldini was incorrectly referred to this genus. 



Ptychomya, Ag., is described as having 3 diverging cardinal 



[June 25, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PniLADELPIIIA. 51 



teeth in each valve, which with other characters show a wide 

 generic difference between it and Pleuroconcha. 



PLIONEMA, Conrad. 



Shell subrotund, sculptured with close radiating lines or fine 

 ribs ; hinge of left valve with 2 robust diverging teeth ; lunule 

 none. 

 Astarte Guerangeri, D'Orbigny. 



The radiating ribs and lunule arel think sufficient to distinguish 

 this as a subgenus. AVhen it is considered that all the numerous 

 species, Cretaceous and recent, of the genus Astarte or Crassina 

 are characterized b\' a well-marked and gcnerall}^ profound lunule, 

 and when ribbed, alwaj's concentricallj', the Aslarle Gueranrjcri 

 forms too marked an excejDtiou to place it in the group of typical 

 species. 



SCAMBULA. 



Shell triangular, compressed ; in the right valve one direct tooth 

 under the apex, with a pit on each side of it, and a long lateral 

 tooth anteriorl}^, posterior dorsal margin carinated, which promi- 

 nent line fits into a doubled lateral tooth, in the opposite valve, 

 left valve with 2 long approximate direct teeth, and a long ante- 

 rior marginal lateral tooth, pallial line invisible, inner margin finely 

 crenulated on a raised line. 



S. perplana, Conrnd, PI. I., fig. 2 



The crcnulations on the shell closely resemble those of Paciiy- 

 TiiiERUS (Cretaceous forms of Crassatella), being arranged in a 

 slightl}' prominent line. The hinge of this shell is very distinct 

 from that of Crassatella. 



PTEROMERIS. 



Shell triangular, compressed, radiatelj' ribbed, not oblique: 

 hinge of left valve with 2 diverging cardinal teeth, the anterior 

 one slightl}' grooved; the po.sterior one elongated, profoundly 

 bifid; i)Ostorior liinge margin carinated. 

 P. perplana, PI. I., fig. 3. 



This genus was indicated in the rrocecdings of the Academy of 

 Natural Sciences in 18()2. It was not founded on Aslnrfr miiiu- 

 tissima as stated b}' Stoliczka, but on Cnrdita perplana a Mio- 

 cene shell. MiCROMERLS was proposed for the former, which from 



1872.] 




52 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



Lea's description and figure must be sufficiently' distinct in generic 

 character. 



In the Eocene catalogue published in the American Journal of 

 Concholog}', Astarte mimdissima was incorrectly referred to Pte- 

 ROMERis. This shell, and Cardita atomus, Deshayes, look much 

 alike extern all^^ 



VETERICARDIA. 



This genus was improperly printed Vetocardia. and I here re- 

 store the correct orthograph}'. 



V. crenalirata, PI. I., fig. 4. 



Venericardia dupiniana, from D'Orbigny, fig. 11. 



Stoliczka has figured a shell under the name of Cardita Jaguenoti 



which has more external resemblance to Venericardia than any 



cretaceous form known to me, but the hinge is diflTerent from that 



of Cardita or Venericardia, and also from that of the present 



genus. 



PLEUROMERIS. 



P. tridentata (Cardita), Sny. 



Ma}- be regarded as the tj'pe of this genus, which was described 

 in the Amer. Journ. of Conch., vol. III., p. 12. 



P. decemcostata, PI. I., fig. 8 



This is a Miocene species in which formation most of the species 

 are found, though the genus first appeared in the Eocene. I 

 refer to this genus Cardita Kickxii, C.chamseformis, Sowerhy, C. 

 scalaris, G. analis, Phil. 



EULOXA. 



Equivalved; hinge of right A-alve having a long oblique bifid 

 tooth immediately under the apex, and one i)3'ramidal thick dis- 

 tant tooth anteriorl}', left valve with 3 distant cardinal teeth, one 

 under the apex oblique thick entire, posterior tooth slender and 

 very oblique, anterior tooth small, pallial line with a slight sinus ; 

 inner margin entire. 



E. latisulcata, PI. I., fig. 5. Proceed. Acad. Nat. Sciences, vol. sir. p. 585. 



This genus essentially differs from Crassina in the thick an- 

 terior tooth of the right valve; in having 3 teeth in the left valve, 

 and in having a dental pit in the right valve where Crassina has 



[June 25, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 53 



a prominent tooth, and in having a pallial sinus. I know of one 

 siJecies only, E. latisulcafa, a Miocene fossil. 



ALVEINUS. 



Shell equivalved, smooth ; hinge of both valves with a central 

 pit or emargination ; right valve with 2 approximate tuberculiform 

 minute teeth, the first immediateh* under the apex and the other 

 beneath and a little in advance of it ; a lanceolate furrow in front of 

 it ; left valve with 2 tuberculiform teeth situated in respect to each 

 other in a line with the anterior hinge marsrin; a subraarafinal 

 channel runs entirely round the valves to the apex; pallial line 

 entire ? 



A. minutns, Conrad, PI. I., fig. 6. Amer. Journ. Conch., vol. i. p. 13S, PI. X., 

 fig, 2. 



A minute shell of the Oligocene period found at Enterprise, 

 Miss. The exterior has much resemblance to that of a ventricose 

 Dosinia. The channel around the submargin of the entire shell 

 is, I belieA'e, an unique character. The figure is greatly enlarged. 

 We have but two specimens of this little bivalve, which is ex- 

 tremely thill in substance. 



PARASTARTE. 



Comparing this minute shell with Goodallia triangularis, the 

 hinge is found to correspond with tliat of the latter, and therefore 

 P. ti'iquetra, Conrad, (Proceed. Acad. Xat. Sciences, 18G2) must 

 be named Goodallia iriquetra. 



LATIARCA. 



Shell triangular, thick, capacious ; hinge line narrow medially, 

 broad at the ends ; cardinal plates elevated strongly and rugosely 

 striated transversely, the larger plates descending; medial phite.s 

 very irregular ; lower margin of posterior cicatrix elevated and 

 acute, ai'ca between the beaks with conspicuous grooves anguhitcd 

 under tlic beaks. 



Latiarca idonea, Conrad, PI. II., Cg. 1. Amor. Journ. Conch., p. 289. Eocene. 



The most essential difference ])etween this genus and Idoucarva 

 is the want of the intcrnnl plate, very prominent in the latter, 

 which is also a ranch .shorter .slioU, with a l)roadi'r hinge plate. 



Cucullaea crassatiua, Lam., is a fine example of this genus. Des-

Shell triangular, thick, ventricose, with radiating lines, hinge 

 broad, medial cardinal plates prominent, linear, transverse, or di- 

 rect and transversely striated ; anterior and posterior plates elon- 

 gated, oblique or descending, angular at the inner ends and 

 strongly striated transversely, inner plate prominent, curved, car- 

 dinal area subequal, grooved.

This genus is one of the most characteristic of the Cretaceous 

 forms, and has the earliest and most developed form of hinge, now 

 represented by the recent Cucullsea. Stoliczka confounds with 

 Macrodon, the two very distinct genera of Idonearca and Gram- 

 MATODON. The latter is a Jurassic genus unknown in Cretaceous 

 strata. 



Having obtained the hinge of a New Jersej' bivalve belonging 

 to a group of wliicli Cucull^a vulgaris^ Morton, is the typical form, 

 I am enabled to subjoin a list of all the species of Idonearca 

 known to nie.

TRIGONOARCA. 



This genus is eminently characteristic of the Xewer Cretaceous 

 series. It has very marked and distinct generic characters, par- 

 ticularly in having teeth like Axinsea and an internal elevated 

 plate like Idonearca and Cucull^a. 



Stoliczka doubts W'hether this genus should not rather be a sub- 

 genus of Noetia, a very strange reference considering that Noetia 

 is strongly ribbed, has comparatively fine hinge teeth, no internal 

 plate and reversed beaks, and above all is no older than the Mio-

cene, while Trigonoarca disappeared at the close of the Chalk 

 epoch. It combines the characters of Axinjea and Idonearca 

 and connects these with Cucull/EA. 



The American species have a very short posterior hinge area, 

 which is rather long anteriorly.

STUDIES OF THE TYEANNID^.— PAKT I, REVISION OF THE SPECIES 

 OF MYIARCHUS. 



BY ELLIOTT COUES. 



A complete and perfectly satisfactory account of this family 

 can only be rendered by some one who has access to the principal 

 European collections as well as those of this country. But if the 

 large amount of United States material is thoroughly worked up, 

 it may become an important contribution to the urgently needed 

 monograph of the future. The present is the first one of a series 

 of papers in which more or fewer of the genera of Tyrannidae 

 will be considered as time and circumstances may allow. The 

 basis of these "studies" should be explicitl}^ stated. The investiga- 

 tion is grounded, first, upon the entire Smithsonian series, which, 

 in the liberal polic}- pursued b}^ the authorities of that institution, 

 is placed in m}' hands; and probably, in the end, the specimens 

 will be made up in sets, labelled in accordance with my views, and 

 distributed to home and foreign societies. Through the friendly 

 offices of Mr. J. A. Allen, the whole collection of the museum 

 of Comparative Zoology has been sent to me. The large suite 

 of the Philadelphia Academy is examined, as well as the Lafres- 

 na^-e types and other specimens in the Boston Society's Museum; 

 while I have received, through the courtesy of Dr. Brewer and 

 Prof. Hyatt, such specimens as the rules of the society permit to 

 leave the building. Mr. Lawrence generously places the fly- 

 catchers of his private cabinet at mj- service; they represent all 

 his types and many other indispensable examples. Prof. Orton 

 has promptly signified his willingness to transmit, from the ex- 

 tensive collection of Yassar College, Poughkeepsie, such speci- 

 mens as I may desire to inspect. Others are derived from m^' 

 own cabinet and miscellaneous sources. Since it does not appear 

 that there is any important material in southern or western cities, 

 what is just recounted virtually represents the gross amount 

 available in the country; and what this is may be inferred by the 

 fact, that the specimens of Myiarclnis alone are over two hundred 

 in number.

 Non Myiarchus apud Bp. Cousp. Av. i. 188. 

 Muscicapa, Tyrannus, Tyrannula, Aliquorum. 



The genus, so called, rests upon no stnictural characters, wliile 

 its .synonyms are among the vagaries of ornithology. But the 

 term is a convenient designation of a group of fl^'catchers modelled 

 in the likeness of Musciaj^a crinifa, L. They stand near Tyr- 

 annus proper, and closely' resemble the olivaceous, yellow-bellied 

 species (" Laph3'ctes") of the latter, such as veiiicalis; but are 

 distinguished by not having the outer primaries emarginate, nor 

 the wings longer than the tail, nor a flame-colored crest. The bill 

 and feet of the two genera do not differ noticeably ; or rather, 

 these members, in the species of Ilyiarchus^ vary as much inter se 

 as the difference between Myiarchus and Tyrannus in the same 

 respects. 



But tlie distinction between Myiarchus and Tyrannus, due to 

 the tolerably strong features of the latter genus, is considerable, 

 compared with the differences subsisting between Myia?-chus and 

 several allied olivaceous flycatchers. Color aside, there are no 

 substantial characters bj' which the Myiarchi can be distinguished 

 generically from " Empidias" fuscus, "Empidonax" acadicus, 

 "Myiodynastes" a?<(7aa;, and others, among which lam not sure 

 that some forms with which I am at present unacquainted may 

 not fall in Myiarchus as defined for the purposes of this paper. 



In the matter of external anatom}', or contour, we can only sa^' 

 that Myiarchi are rather large tyrannulas, with the nearl}' even 

 tail so lengtliened that when measured inside the coccyx it equals 

 or rather exceeds the wing in length; witli the wing rather .short, 

 and its point formed by llie third, or third and fourth quills, 

 closely supported by the second and lifth, the first being only as 

 long as tlie inner primaries; with the bill of the most ordinary 

 tyrannuliue shape, a little more or less Hum lialf its own length 



• I ((uote this and the following name on Gray's authority, having no 

 means of verifying the references. 

 1872.] 5 




58 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



broad opposite the nostrils, and a little shorter than the tarsus, 

 which latter somewhat exceeds the middle toe and claw in length; 

 and with the occipital and coronal feathers somewhat lanceolate 

 and lengthened into a slight crest. 



Coloration is a good arbitrary clue to the genus. The upper 

 parts are more or less oYixe, sometimes clear and bright, sometimes 

 grayish or brownish ; the throat is more or less ash}-, variable in 

 shade ; the belly is more or less yellow, from a rich shade to a 

 mere trace; and the wing and tail feathers are marked with rufous, 

 sometimes intense, and occupying the whole of certain feathers, 

 sometimes reduced to a mere trace; but even in those species, in 

 which it is at a minimum, it ma}^ be detected in some specimens. 

 If one will la^^ the following birds side by side, one will see this 

 distinctive brand of coloration running through them all, though 

 at first sight such a form as antillarum does not particularly re- 

 semble validus. The TyroMni aflTord a parallel series between ex- 

 tremes, from the most olivaceous yellow-bellied species, like verti- 

 calis, to the dark ashy white-bellied carolinensis. Still, in a cer- 

 tain per cent, of specimens of several 3Ii/iarchi the rufous is 

 ordinarily imperceptible. 



Judged b}' the foregoing standard, " Blacicus" t7-istis is a pure 

 Myiarchxis ; in fact, it is the insular representative of nigriceps, as 

 stolidiis is of lawrencei. " Blacicus" pallidus, however, falls unde r 

 " Contopus," owing to the smallness of the feet. " Tyrannus" 

 antillarum, Bryant, referred by Gra}^ to typical Tyrannus, is 

 certainly a true 3Iyiarchtis, being simply an insular variety of M. 

 stolidus. But this error of Gray's is a slight matter, compared with 

 his assignment of stolidus itself to an entirely different genus of an- 

 other sub-famil}'^; this bird being pure Afyiarchiis, only specifically 

 distinguishable from M. lawrencei as its insular representative. I 

 know nothing of the "On3'chopterus tuberculifer Lafr." which 

 Gray interpolates betwixt the larger and smaller species of typical 

 Uyiarchus ; but I suspect it does not belong just here. Likewise 

 I have not seen four oth :r species ascribed to the genus, viz. : 

 tricolor, cantans and gracilirostris, Pelzeln, ^wd fasciaius, Landb. ; 

 so I cannot say whether or not they fall in the group as here de- 

 fined; but there is little, if any doubt, that they belong here. 

 Excepting these, 1 have before me, I believe, types or typical spe- 

 cimens of all the described species of 3Iyiarchus ; and these I 

 purpose to elaborate in this paper. And that I may not be mis-

understood in my method of treating them, 1 v;\\\ state explicitly 

 that I am gOA'erned, on this occasion, by the following arl)itrary 

 rules or definitions : — 



I. I predicate " species" upon specimens presenting any defi- 

 nite, constant, tangible characters whatsoever, that do not, so far 

 as it appears, grade into the characters of other specimens. 



II. I predicate ''varieties'' upon specimens presenting indefinite 

 and inconstant yet tangible characters that arc seen to grade into 

 the characters of other specimens. 



III. I predicate "synonyms" upon specimens presenthig in- 

 definite, inconstant, and intangible characters due to individual 

 peculiarities, or to age, sex, season, or locality; as well as upon 

 specimens presenting no special characters at all. 



My present belief is, that there are only four' forms of Mi/i- 

 archus that do not intergrade, and that are differentiated from 

 a common original stock to such degree, or in such manner, that 

 wo cannot account for their respective peculiarities according to 

 highly probable laws of geographical variation depending upon 

 dilferences in food, climate, etc.; but I cannot here enter upon 

 debatable ground. According to the foregoing practically con-' 

 vcnient if not very scientific rules, I find that tlie specimens ex- 

 amined represent nine species, two of which each present tlircc 

 tangible vai'ieties." 



Before proceeding to handle these species and varieties I will 

 recount several propositions that should receive due consideration. 



a. The normal inherent variability in size, of the whole bird 

 and of its several members, is at least 12 per cent, of the mean. 

 (This is independent of all extraneous influences.) 



b. Size varies in direct ratio with the latitude of the breeding 

 place. 



e. Size of peripheral parts, as compared with total size, varies 



' One is the scries comprising cvinitus, validus^ cincrascens, tyrannulun 

 and pTicpocephaluH ; the second is lawrencii and nigriceps ; tlic third, xto- 

 lidus ; fourth, tristis. 



2 In defining these varieties, as 1 do lieyond, I must not he tiik<'ii as 

 meaning that tlio character-, assigned always apply in full force: that 

 would be prima facie evidence of species. i)n the contrary, I describt! the 

 extreme jtliase of variation, which shades by insensible steps into the 

 "typical" condition of the species.

in inverse ratio with the latitude of the breeding-place.' (Cf. 

 Allen, Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool. ii. p. 229 ) 



d. The ? is generallj^ a little smaller than the % . 



e. Intensit^^ of coloration varies in direct ratio with the tem- 

 perature and humidity of the breeding-place. Moisture, however, 

 intensifies color ;nore than heat; aridity tones down color more than 

 cold. Birds from hot dry places, therefore, are paler cseteris 

 jmribus, than birds from wet places of the same or even lower 

 temperature. (Cf. Allen, op. cit. p. 239.) 



f. The rufous coloration belongs to the categor}^ of what some 

 call " embryonic features," in the sense that it generally decreases 

 with age. Young birds are suffused with rufous to an extent 

 rarely if ever seen in the old ; this is shown both in the greater 

 extent of the color on the quills and tail, and in the modification 

 of the olivaceous by admixture, young birds being "browner" 

 than the old. 



g. In the adult state, the freshest plumage is the most oliva- 

 ceous, as the feathers wear browner with exposure. 



/?. The yellow coloration increases with age to a certain extent; 

 and in the fall is at least as bright as, if not brighter than, in 

 spring, in equally mature birds. 



i. The sexes do not diflfer in color to a recognizable degree.'' 



k. Yariation unconnected with age, sex, or season, is in inverse 

 ratio with the migration or changeable geographical distriljution 

 of individuals. 



This last important generalization is well illustrated in the cases 

 of crinifus and stolidus. Tlie former is the most extensively dis- 

 persed species of the genus, being found at different seasons from 

 Guatemala to New England. As its individuals are never con- 



' But certain localities produce larger bills, in opposition to this rule, or 

 show greater variability in the size of the bill, according to influences at 

 present unknown; e. g., the large bills of the Tehuantepec Myiarchi; the 

 extremely variable bills of the Jamaican M. stolidus. 



2 An unquestionable fact, in its application to crinitus and some others. 

 Authors, however, speak of color-difl'erences in the sexes of the South Ame- 

 rican species, ferox. I have been unable to verify such statements, and 

 think that a point of age, not of sex, is involved, younger birds having ru- 

 fous that afterward disappears. If so be it, that such sexual differences 

 really subsist in the case of ferox, then my entire characterization of that 

 species falls to the ground, and the bird cannot be specifically distinguished 

 from the variety of crinitus that I call irritabiUs, beyond. 



[July 2, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 61 



tinuoiisly subjected to local modifying influences of a special 

 kind, it preserves its peculiarities intact; specimens from the ex- 

 tremes of its range are utterh' indistinguishable. But the non- 

 migratory individuals of ^Mexico, belonging to the same criniliis 

 stock, present recognizable local varieties; whilst M. stolidus, a 

 thoroughl}' localized bird, stationary in several places, has de- 

 veloped several sharply distinguished insular races peculiar to the 

 islands they respectivel}^ occupy.' 



I can offer no satisfactory explanation of the fact that several 

 species of the genus are distinguished bj' the amount of rufous 

 coloring, though I suspect it may be referable to proposition e, 

 considering fuscous a " more intense" coloration than rufous. 

 Certainly the northernmost bird, crmitus, and the bird of the 

 New Mexican deserts, have the most rufous of any continental 

 forms. The extent of rufous decreases even in the Mexican varie* 

 ties of crinitus, is still less in laicrencii, and almost or quite 

 disappears in the purel}- tropical nigriceps^ ferox, and phceocepha- 

 lus. But even continental specimens of an opjiosite character occur, 

 whilst the insular species, validus and stolid us, offer completely 

 rebutting testimony. 



Til is general question of the production of the rufous aside, 

 stud^- of these birds makes it evident that large allowance must 

 be granted for purely individual — commonly called "accidental" — 

 differences in amount or intensity of the rufous in specimens of 

 the same species. Though it is certain that, for example, validus, 

 cinerascens, and crinitus, with its varieties, may each be recog- 

 nized witli tolerable facility by their respective patterns of the 

 rufous, whether occup3-ing the whole, or a small part, or a different 

 part of the inner webs of the rectrices, yet it is equally cerlnin 

 that no such slight distinctions as its occupying a fourtii, a fifth, 

 or a sixth of the web, fading insensibly or changing abruptly into 

 the fuscous, etc., can be relied upon at all. Among the varieties 

 of M. stolidus, indeed, we can trace the restriction of the rufous 

 by insensible degrees, from its occupying two-thirds of the inner 

 web to its narrow edging of the feather, and finally to its forming 

 a mere trace at the end. Moreover, the rufous differs so much in

extent and even in pattern in the same individual at different 

 stages of plumage, that we can only compare age for age and 

 season for season with an}- success in determination of specific 

 characters. It is mosf, probable that even the wide limits I set for 

 Tariability in this respect, due to age, season, and individual pecu- 

 liarity, Avill require to be somewhat enlarged. 



The foregoing paragraphs must not be construed as any attempt 

 to undervalue the interesting and sometimes extremely curious 

 characters distinguishing the several species. Though in the 

 following pages I may appear to have "unnecessarily," if not 

 unwarrantably, reduced the number of species, yet I am persuaded 

 that no unprejudiced ornithologist could have reached different 

 conclusions upon study of the same material. It may be well to 

 remember that two hundred specimens of BIyiarrhus have never 

 before been examined by one person at a coup cVoeil: and I really 

 think that with two thousand specimens instead of two hundred, 

 I should not be able to establish as many species as are here 

 allowed. Others will judge whether I have placed the species 

 here discussed upon sure footing; I simply ask for impartial 

 criticism.

The bill is nearly at the maximum size for the genus, is largely 

 light-colored at base below, and not perfectly black elsewhere, as in 

 var. cooperi^ another subtropical form. The rufous coloration is 

 at the maximum both of intensity- and extent; it occupies a part 

 or the whole of every single feather of the wings and tail and their 

 coverts ; it is intense on the outer edges of the primaries, paler on 

 the inner edges of these and other remiges, paler still (3'et not 

 whitish) on the outer edges of the inner remiges ; it tips and 

 edges all the upper coverts, and suffuses all the under coverts, 

 both of wings and tail ; it usually occupies the whole outer rectrix, 

 and whole inner web of the other rectrices (saving tlie middle pair), 

 excepting a narrowest possible shaft line ; moreover, it narrowly 

 edges the outer webs of the rectrices. In fact, the tail might be 

 described as rufous, with the central rectrices and a narrow 

 shaft line on the others, fuscous. Nothing like this is known to 

 occur in any continental form. Likewise the bird has a peculiar 

 sordid aspect below, arising from impurity- both of tlie asli and the 

 yellow ; which colors have no definite line of separation.

Oha. — These references and diagnosis apply exclusively to the 

 bird that breeds in the L'nited States, entirely withdrawing in the 

 fall to winter in Central America. This is pure crinitus; the birds 

 that summer in Mexico and elsewhere south of the United States 

 have developed other varieties (infra). During the extensive 

 migrations, its passage seems rapid and its path narrow; for we 

 haA'e no Antillean (except as above) nor West Mexican quotations 

 of the bona fide crinitus, and few Mexican skins are certainly re- 

 ferable to it. In passing from its winter headquarters, either it flies 

 across the Gulf, or else it hugs the eastern coast of Mexico. I have 

 3'et to see t^ypical crinitus from South America. 



Diagno.stic points to be remembered are these : bill never quite 

 black ; stout and coraparativeh'- short, hardlj^ or not equalling 

 the tarsus, which latter never (?) touches .90 ; back pure olive, 

 throat pure ash, belly, etc., pure j-ellow ; inner secondaries and 

 upper wing coverts and outer rectrix edged with j'ellowish-white 

 (never rufous — cf. validus), in marked contrast with rufous edgings 

 of primaries and inner webs of rectrices ; all rectrices but the 

 middle pair so nearl}' completely rufous on the inner webs that a 

 mere line of fuscous persists next the shaft (cf. irritabilis et 

 cooj)eri) ; this runs of equal breadth the whole length of the 

 feathers {cf. cinerascens) ; it is sometimes inappreciable on some 

 feathers (then about as in validus) ; none of the rectrices ever with 

 more than a trace of rufous on the outer web. 



About sixty specimens examined. (Mus. S. I., etc. etc.) Xearly 

 all these not of the United States are Guatemalan, are positive 

 duplicates of Pennsylvania skins, for instance, and were doubtless 

 hatched in the United States. Other Guatemalan examples and 

 manj'' Mexican skins of birds that never saw the United States, 

 represent different varieties, as follows.

Obs. — This bird, so far from being specifically distinct from the 

 ordinar}' North American form, is so extremely similar as to be 

 with difllcult}' recognizable as a variety of typical criniliis. The 

 size is the same; there are no evident nor constant diflerences in 

 the relative proportions of bill, feet, tail, and wings, and thi; general 

 colors only differ b}' a shade. The bill is exactly as in crinittis ; 

 having neither the elongate, constrictiul shape of cinerasccns, nor 

 the general bulkiness of var. cooperi and of validui<. In mo.st of 

 my specimens it happens that the plumage is old and worn, so 

 that these look browner or grayer on the back than is usual for 

 true ciinitus; but the Paraguay and Parana skins in better 

 feather are not to my eye an appreciable shade different from 

 several United States skins ; the 3ellow below, however, is recog- 

 nizably paler, and the gular ash seems to have a little more pectoral 

 extension. There is, however, one obvious and nearhf constant 

 discrepancy in the pictura of the tail feathers, enabling me to 

 predicate a variet}'. On on average the rufous and tiie fuscous on 

 the inner webs of the rectriccs are dimidiate — iialf-and-half in 

 amount; this never occurs to my knowledge in I'nitid States 

 crinifus (cf. descr.). The relative breadlli varies as follows: The

 American skins; and then we have l-^ to nil in a Xicai'aguan 

 (S. I., No. 41,789) and in vai'ious North American skins. Com- 

 ment is unnecessary. 



As the foregoing synonymy may be regarded with mistrustful 

 surprise, it becomes me to state my case explicitly. " Tyrannus 

 irritabilis Vieill." is generally enumerated amongst the sj-nonj-ms 

 of crinitus — correctly so, leaving out of consideration the varieties 

 of the latter. But Yieillot's bird, being based on Azara, is of 

 course South American, and I have yet to see pure crinitus from 

 that portion of the continent, all my South American specimens 

 being characterizal)le as above. So we have "a local habitation 

 and a name," as firm ground for further investigation. 



I take the Nos. 16,349, 16,348 (Paraguay and Parana) as 

 being unquestionably the Azara-Yieillot l)ird ; the}' are both dis- 

 tinguishable from United States o^initus by the characters above 

 detailed ; but one of them has the fuscous stripe along the inner 

 web much broader than the other. 



Next, the Bahia skin (Mus. G. N. L.), as I see by the label, has 

 been compared with the type of er3'throcercus, in Mus. P. L. S., 

 and found identical. It is in poor plumage, quite brownish above, 

 and " streak}'" below, and has the fuscous rather broader still, but 

 there is less difference in the breadth of the fuscous in this speci- 

 men, and in No. 16.348, than there is between 16,348 and 16,349. 

 All three are unquestionably identical. This fixes the status of 

 '^erythrocercus." 



Then, the type of "3'ucatanensis" Lawr. 1871 (="mexicanus" 

 Lawr. 1869), now in my hands, has the rufous and fuscous exactly 

 as in typical " erythrocercus," and is in other respects a duplicate 

 of the latter. That Mr. Lawrence did not recognize this identity is 

 doubtless- due to the fact that his example of "erythrocercus" 

 Avas not in his hands at the time. When he published "yuca- 

 tanensis (I)ased on the same Yucatan specimen he called " mexi- 

 canns" in 1869) he did so simply upon Dr. Sclater's announcement 

 that mej:?'ca?2w,s Kaup was the Idrd called " cooperi" by Baird — 

 quite a different variety, and usually held to be a different species. 



[July 2,

Thus we arrive at the above synonymy. I should add. in 

 justice to an excellent young ornithologist, noted for discrimi- 

 native abilities, that I am not the fii'st to perceive the identit}' of 

 the specimens here discussed. They are all labelled "mcxicanus" 

 in Rol)ert Ridgwa3's handwriting — he having accurately distin-

 parts (usually) so bright yellow; and especially by tiie presence 

 of a band of fuscous on the inner webs of the rectrices, varying 

 from I or ^ to nearly ^ the widtii of the vanes. In its strongest 

 differentiation, the variety looks very different from typical crini- 

 fus, but with onl}' a dozen specimens on hand, I can trace it 

 directly into ci'inilutt, of which it is unquestionably a mere local 

 race. It seems nearly confined to southern and southwestern

68 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



The Mazatlan and Guadalaxara skins are the two biggest 

 Myiarchi I ever saw; one of them is marl^ed "length (fresh) 9^;" 

 their bills are enormous, comparing with ordinary crinitus almost 

 as Tyrannua magniros(?^is or crassirodrin do with carolinensia. 

 They are scarcely different from crinitus in color, except in the 

 definite fuscous stripe, about ^ the width of the inner web, on 

 the tail feathers. The several Tehuantepec skins are essentially 

 similar, but grade towards crinitus^ or rather towards ii^ritahilis, 

 and in other skins the boundary line is too shadowy to be seen 

 at all. 



Of my own knowledge, of course I have no idea what the 

 "Tyrannula mexicana" of Kaup is — for no one who has not seen 

 the type can tell anything about it. But, according to Mr. Law- 

 rence {I. c), Dr. Sclater has recently examined the tj'pe, and 

 announces it is what Prof. Baird called "cooperi" in 1858. Now 

 I have in my hand the specimen (No. 9100, Mus. S. I., "Mexique," 

 Verreaux) that furnished the account in the Birds of North 

 America, and it is one of the large heavy-billed examples of true 

 var. cooperi as characterized in this paper ; that is to saj^, " mexi- 

 canus" Kaup, and "cooperi" Kaup, are one and the same thing, 

 if Dr. Sclater has correctly apprehended Prof. Baird's article. I 

 hardly see, however, how this can be, for Kaup must have meant 

 to indicate two species or varieties, and it is reasonable to suppose 

 his specimens showed aome differences. My own surmise is, that 

 the t^'pe of "mexicanus" is one of those intermediate specimens 

 that Dr. Sclater could hardly \\q\\) identifying with Baird's de- 

 scription of "cooperi," the latter's No. 9100 being by no means 

 one of the largest-billed specimens ; and it seems to be also Mr. 

 Ridgway's opinion, to judge by his labelling, that " mexicanus" is 

 rather referable to the smaller-billed variet3'' above characterized 

 under the name of irritahilis. However, the game is not worth 

 the candle, since fortunately it proves that the name need not be 

 used at all ; and the sooner " mexicanus" is forgotten the better. 

 It has caused vexatious mistakes enough alread}', four different 

 authors having used it in as many different senses, in the vain 

 attempt to identify something not identifiable. 



Turning to a more inviting point, it is interesting to observe 

 how many 3Ti/iarchi come to a focus, as it were, on and near the 

 Isthmus, and thence radiate in all directions. First we have in 

 winter the birds that breed in the United States, constituting true

 tance northwestward to form tlie local race cooperi, and yet 

 another, chiefly' spreading southward throughout the greater part 

 of South America, forming the variety irrilahilis. It is little, if 

 any, bej'ond the southern terminus of cinerascens, forms the 

 southern limit of laivrencei, and constitutes the northern lioundarN- 

 of nicjricepH and tyrannulus (ferox). In fact, every continental

 I have seen no indeterminable si)cciiuens, though I suspect that 

 questionable ones will yet appear from southwestern .Aloxico. 

 But the fact that the bird occurs there associate<l with varieties 

 of crimluH without losing its distinctive features, favors the sup-

TO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



The most reliable peculiarity of cinerascens is tlie contour of 

 the rufous on the rectrices. In all other Myiarchi examined the 

 rufous, no matter how broad or how narrow, is straight-edged 

 against the fuscous from base to tip; but in cinerascens it occu- 

 pies the whole inner web for about h or f the length of the 

 feather, and then bends inward to give way to fuscous that conse- 

 quently possesses most or all of the tip of the feather. It is a 

 curiously slight matter to be so constant as it appears ; and it is 

 not absolutely invariable. Thus, in U. S. specimens, constituting 

 the best-marked examples, the rufous is coramonlj^ altogether shut 

 off from the end of the feathers, while in Tehuantepec skins the 

 rufous gains the very tip, being but little encroached upon by the 

 fuscous. However, even in these specimens, which barely escape 

 being troublesome, the peculiar pattern in exhibited. But in no 

 case do other than adult birds show the peculiarity ; e. (/., in No. 

 1595, Mus. E. C, shot from the nest in Arizona, the wings and 

 tail are nearly as rufous as in validusf the margins of all the 

 remiges and upper wing coverts, and all the tail feathers are 

 rufous, the rectrices having each merely a narrow shaft-line of 

 fuscous; the upper parts are grayish-brown, without olive ; the 

 cap warm pure brown, the bell}'- white, slashed with yellow. 



But cinerascens has other marks, none of them infallible, all of 

 them nevertheless useful. It is the palest Myiarchus of all. The 

 upper parts are graj^, merely suffused with olive, and browner on 

 the head; the gular ash is gray and hoary; the belly ver}^ pale 

 yellow, or yellowish-white, without sharp demarcation from the 

 hoary on the breast; the margining of the inner secondaries and 

 wing coverts is grayish-white (not yellowish nor ochrey-white) ; 

 the bill is almost perfectly black. My palest birds come from the 

 United States deserts and from Cape St. Lucas; here the olive 

 , above and yellow below are barely appreciable. Tehuantepec and 

 Mazatlan birds are the brightest ; here the yellow is almost as 

 pure as in crinitus (and these, it ^vill be remembered, are the ones 

 with rather dubious tail-coloration). 



There is notliing diagnostic in the size or shape of this bird, 

 but several tangible characters are usually exhibited. Compared 

 with crinitus^ the bill has a constricted, somewhat more terete 

 shape ; probably it is rarel}' if ever quite half as wide as long op- 

 posite the nostrils. The tarsi average longer, frequently touching 

 .90. The wings average a little shorter relatively, and the tail a 



[July 2,

trifle longer, the latter exceeding the former, on an average, .10 

 to .25, instead of equalling the wings. 



Yar. " pertinax" not distinguishable even as a local race; the 

 specimens vary infer se, and some of them are perfect duplicates 

 of my Arizona skins. The yellow-bellied Tehuantepec bird comes 

 much nearer the requirements of a geographical variety. 



Baird's erroneous identification of Kaup's " mexicana" is per- 

 fectly excusable, and, indeed, was well nigh unavoidable under the 

 circumstances. Kaup's careless notice is wortldess for all practi- 

 cal purposes, and we have to thank Dr. Sclater for telling us 

 what his bird really is. (Cf. Lawr., P. A. X. S. P., 18T1, 235.) 

 Other American writers copied Baird's mistake. This point 

 settled, the sj-non^-my of the bird is plain, Mr. Lawrence's origi- 

 nal description being perfectly satisfactory.

06.S. — The ordinary South American Mi/iai-chus is distinguislied 

 at a glance from all the foregoing by the reduction of the rufous 

 edging of the rectrices and primaries to a mere trace, or its entire 

 absence. 



This bird averages a little smaller than crinitus ; the bill is 

 shaped and colored exactly as in that species, but is rather 

 smaller ; the wings are shorter, both absolutely and relatively, not 

 often quite equalling the tail; the tarsi, on the contrarj', are a 

 little longer. In these respects the bird tallies to a nicety with 

 cinerascens. 



The colors are rarely if ever as bright and clear as in crinitus. 

 There is generall}^ a mere trace of rufous on the outer edges of the 

 primaries and rectrices, and in younger birds is quite noticeable; 

 but I have never seen a touch of it on the inner webs of the rec- 

 trices. The outer edges of the wing coverts and inner remiges, 

 and the outer edges of the outer rectrices, and the inner edges of 

 the remiges, are whitish or pale j^ellowish ; otherwise the wings 

 and tail are concolor and unicolor. 



With both Mr. Lawrence's types, a typical Brazilian swainsoni 

 labelled in Dr. Sclater's handwriting, and various unquestionable 

 ferox before me, I cannot distinguisli even a geographical variet}^ 

 among them all. The}' are indisputably identical. 



Sicainsoni is one of those constantl}' recurring cases of the 

 attempt to distinguish Brazilian individuals from specimens of the 

 same species from northern South America. Sometimes, I know, 

 local influences have produced modifications recognizable as geo- 

 graphical varieties, and I am willing to admit in this case that 

 swainsoni may run a shade darker, and possibl}' average a trifle 

 larger than ordinary /e?'ox; but the difference is not even tangible, 

 much less reasonably constant. Birds from either localit}^ differ 

 as much among themselves as they do from each other; and some 

 specimens of swainsoni are more like ferox than the}' are like 

 other specimens of swainsoni. 



Panamensis, as originall}' described, was compared with crinitus 

 and cinerascens, and its striking differences correctl}' indicated. 

 But I am persuaded that if Mr. Lawrence had compared it with 

 ferox, be would have been satisfied of its identity with the latter. 



Venezuelensis is based upon a youngish bird, which, as usual 



[July 2, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 73 



in this genus (see above), shows more rufous than is retained in 

 adult life. The outer webs of the rectrices show quite a rufous 

 edging; but there is none at all on the inner webs; and in all 

 other respects the specimen is a perfect duplicate of some skins 

 of ferox. 



The older names above quoted, including the one it seems ne- 

 cessar}' to adopt for the species, are given upon Gra^-'s authorit}'. 

 I have not been able to look up the references, but I presume there 

 is no doubt of their pertinence.

Obs. — My material is insufficient for a satisfactory determina- 

 tion in this case, but the species is different from an}' other, so 

 far as I can judge from the single imperfect specimen before me, 

 labelled phseocephalus in Lawrence's handwriting, which is the basis 

 of his citation, /. c. It is apparently an old bird moulting, the quills 

 and tail feathers being ungrown. The wings and tail are blackish 

 with the whitish edgings above mentioned, and are without a trace 

 of rufous ; in these respects the bird is like ferox^ but there the 

 resemblance ends, phseocejjhahiH being clear olive, much like 

 crinitus on the back, shading on the head and neck into olivaceous 

 ash, not very different from that of the throat. The pileum shows 

 quite dusky in contrast. The whitish edgings of the remigcs and 

 outer tail feathers are strong. The dimensions cannot be given 

 exactly, but the bird seems to have been nearly 8 inches long, 

 with the wing and tail each about 3f ; the bill measures .75 from 

 the front, the tarsus .90. 



Additional information respecting the bird is tlesirablc, since 

 there is room for suspicion that it is a local race of the preceding.

 (Garmiol., Frantzius). 



Obs. — With much the same strong olive, clear ash, and rich 

 yellow that characterize crinitus, lawrencii is distinguished on 

 sight by its smaller size ; pileum generally dark, in strong contrast 

 to the back ; wing coverts and inner secondaries edged with much 

 the same rufous as the primaries are (as in volidus), and ver^^ 

 narrow rufous edging of the tail feathers, often wanting altogether 

 on the inner webs, and almost alwa3^s stronger on the outer webs 

 than on the inner ones. In young birds the edging of the inner 

 webs is usuall}^ very noticeable, but it is never, so far as I have 

 seen, so broad as is usually the case with the associated continental 

 species and varieties ; never half the breadth of the vane. Further- 

 more, the bill of laiurencii departs from the thick, deep, heavy style 

 of the larger 3Iyiarchi, and is broad and flat nearly as in the smaller 

 olivaceous flj^catchers, such as Contopus and Empidonax. It varies 

 much, as usual, in precise shape, but is generally just about half 

 its own length broad at the nostrils. 



Mr. Lawrence has already very properly- called attention to the 

 fact, that the supposed M. nigricapillus of Dr. Cabanis offers no 

 tangible specific characters ; while for myself I cannot make out 



[July 16, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 75 



that it is even a recognizable variet}'. It is true that in Costarica 

 laiorencii tends to be a little darker on the pileum, with the j-ellow 

 a little more extensive ; but it is also true that these characters 

 •will not decide the status of ten per cent, of current specimens. 

 NigricapUlus is simply a slight tendency towards nigriceps. 



The normal variations in size and color are precisely parallel 

 with those already discussed under head of M. cinerascens. 

 Northern and western specimens average a trifle paler than 

 usual ; the southernmost are the brightest. Sometimes the 

 edgings of the inner remiges and the coverts are whitish. Tchu- 

 antepec skins show the stoutest bill ; this is likewise tlie case in 

 crinitus var. and cinerascens^ showing the uniform operation of 

 some unknown local influences. One example (34,810, Mus. S. I., 

 Costarica) has exceptionally short wings and tail, these members 

 measuring only 2.80 and 2.90 respectivel3'. 



Specimens examined, thirtj^-three. The bird seems to range 

 throughout Mexico and Central America. I have never seen a 

 United States skin, and though the species ma^' overstep the 

 Mexican boundary, this remains to be shown. Probably Giraud's 

 bird came from Xortheastern Mexico, as some others of his sixteen 

 "Texas" birds certainly did.

 rufous trace can only be detected in some specimens on the outer

edges of a few primaries, the inner edges of which, however, show 

 it a little more plainly. For the rest, the secondaries and coverts 

 are evidently ochrej^-whitish margined. The bird will average 

 smaller than laivrencii, but the difference in size is not marked. 



The three specimens examined, one of them the basis of Mr. 

 Lawrence's remarks upon the proposed " brunneiceps," which he 

 has siMce abandoned, are absolutely identical. Having no doubt 

 that nirjriceps is simply a geographical representative of laiurencii, 

 I fear that troublesome specimens will yet occur from intermediate 

 localities. But the differentiation has become perfectlj' tangible, 

 and I have seen no connecting links, so that I can indorse the 

 species, upon the principles already laid down for my guidance in 

 this paper.

I admit none of the many nominal species established upon 

 this elastic tj'pe : for they all run into each other. But I can 

 distinguish three local races, the extremes of which are readily 

 characterized, though their mutual intergradation — as perfect as 

 we ever see in stationary insular birds — renders it impossible to 

 put them on substantial specific bases. 



Compared with the only large insular species (validus), these 

 birds of the stolidus pattern fill the same position that lawrencii 

 holds in relation to the larger continental species and varieties 

 with which it is associated, though they are perfectly distinct 

 from laiorencii. In the lengthened and constricted bill stolidus 

 differs from the flatter-billed lawrencii, and copies a noticeable 

 feature of cinerascens.

 Habitat — Ins. Jamaica. St. Domingo. Hayti. 

 Obis. — To take this variety as a standard for comparison of the 

 others (though of course it is no more " typical of the species" 

 than either of the others is), I find its particular character in tlie 

 combination of decidedly yellow belly with tail feathers so broadly 

 edged on the inner web with rufous that this color and the fuscous 

 occup}' nearly equal areas. Either color maj' be restricted to one- 

 third of the width of the web, but neither is ever wanting. The 

 primaries are lightly touched with rufous on their outer webs ; the 

 secondaries and upper coverts are edged with soiled whilisli, 

 always evident, generally j-ellowish, in young birds tinged witli 

 rufous. The dark olive of the back is generally pretty pure, con- 

 trasting with the blackisli cap; but in weather-worn plumages tlie 

 upper parts arc grayish-brown, including the pileum, and in sudi 

 ragged state the wings show little edging, and the yellow of the 

 belly looks pale and dirt}'. 



This bird is best known by Jamaican material, but specimens 

 from some of the other islands are indistinguisliable. I have 

 before me all the specimens upon which Mr. March (/. c.) based 

 his remarks upon the smaHer Jamaican "petcharics" or "tom 

 fools ;" there is certainly nothing but pure stoHdus among them, 

 though their individual variations are unusually great. Some of 

 the skins appear to somewhat exceed the normal limits above 

 given in size, and the dilfercnces in the size and shape of the bill 

 are remarkal)le. One has a twisted bill ; several otliers are allii- 

 notic, a condition to which the species seems singularly liable in 

 this locality.

Examining Dr. Biyant's typical examples of var. domimcensis 

 (Port-au-Prince ; Yoimglove), I can see that, as he says, the remiges 

 and rectrices are a little more rufons than in most Jamaican skins ; 

 but I also find that they can be precisely matched by some of the 

 latter, and consequently I am unable to recognize a variety in 

 this case. Dr. Br^-ant's other varieties (lucaysiensis and mitil-

Hab. — Cuba. Bahamas. 



Obs. — The Cuban and Bahaman birds (which are precisely 

 alike) ordinarily" have the inner webs of the rectrices, as in 

 Jamaican sfolidus, nearly half rufous, half fuscous ; but the rufous 

 tends to be a little restricted, half the breadth of the vane seeming 

 to be its maximum width, while it is frequently reduced to a mere 

 edging, especially in Cuban skins. Variety i^hoebe, however, is 

 well distinguished from variety sloUdus by other characters, the 

 chief of which is the almost entire absence of yellow on the under 

 parts. These, in fact, are "white," shaded in front with ashy, 

 and just tinged behind with 3'ellow — the latter, however, is some- 

 times inappreciable. The rufous edging of the primaries is at a 

 minimum ; the whitish edging of the secondai'ies and upper 

 coverts is at a maximum. There is not so much olive in the 

 color of the upper parts as in var. stolidus, while the cap is much 

 less abruptly darker. 



Dr. Bryant says that his variety (lucaysiensis) is " larger than 

 either the Jamaican stolidus or the Cuban sagj^se,^' and probably 

 this is so, on an average, but any difference there may be in this 

 respect eludes me in comparing any except the largest lucaysiensis 

 with the smalkst of the others. I can only distinguish lucaysi-

ensis from true sfolidus bj' the nearly white belh', and find it 

 absolute!}' inseparable from the Cuban sagrae. 



I cannot find where (if anywhere) Dr. Bryant has characterized 

 the Baharaan bird as '■' hahamensis;"^ but on p. 00, in text under 

 " dominicensis" he says that the latter " differs from sagrce and 

 bahamensis in the distinct yellow of the abdomen," etc., showing 

 that his "bahamensis" is a white-bellied bird, and being from the 

 Bahamas, it must be the same as lucarjsiensis.

 tiation is here at an extreme, the better marked examples looking 

 very little like tlie Jamaican stolidus, and not particularl}' resem- 

 bling even the wliitish-bellied Cuban phrebe. In extreme cases the 

 tail feathers liave no rufous edging at all, and the belly is pure 

 white. But we have already seen, in the Cuban and Bahaman 

 bird, that the belly fades away from the j^ellow that is found in 

 the Jamaican, through every shade, till it is sometimes white ; 

 and we have likewise observed the reduction of the rufous to a 

 mere edging of the rectrices ; thence into antillarum is but a 

 step. Some specimens of antillarum have the inner webs mar- 

 gined with rufous part wa}' down ; and the difference in thi.s 

 respect between these and some Cuban phcrbe is not so great as 

 may be found among different individuals of either of the other 

 varieties. These examples of antillarum also show the most 

 yellowish on the belly, this often exceeding the amount exhibited 

 by Cuban or Bahaman skins. In the purest antillarum, however, 

 the rufous is usually restricted to a mere trace at the end of the 

 inner webs, and it maj' disappear altogether. 



I could easily and plausibly describe antillarum as a species, but

I am confident that my mode of treating it is a Ijetter way. In 

 fact, my view is simply an amplification of the judicious queiy 

 that Dr. Bryant inserted after the word "species" in the first 

 sentence of his original description. 



Avoiding all qualified expressions, and ignoring details, I ma}'- 

 finall}' recapitulate and discriminate the three insular varieties of 

 stolidus, thus: — 



Var. stolidus : Belly ^yellow, tail feathers edged with rufous. 



Yar. phoebe : Belly white, tail feathers edged with rufous. 



Yar. antillarum : Bell}' white, tail feathers not edged with rufous. 



Twenty-nine specimens examined of the several varieties, from 

 the localities above quoted.

Ohs. — The smallest species of the group, and the one showing 

 the least rufous on the tail and primaries of an}' of the smaller 

 ones, unless it be antillarum. There is no rufous at all on the 

 inner webs of the rectrices, but close inspection will show rufous 

 traces on the outer webs of these feathers near the base, at any 

 rate; rufous edging is evident on the outer webs of the primaries, 

 and a very j^ale cast of rufous is more conspicuous on their inner 

 webs. The upper wing and tail coverts show the same thing, but 

 the edging of the inner secondaries is whitish. 



This species does not particularly resemble any of the foregoing. 

 It shows perhaps the broadest and flattest bill of an}' ; the width 

 of the bill, at or just behind the nostrils, exceeding half its length. 

 In this respect it departs notabl}- from M. stolidus, its geographical 

 associate, and repeats laivrencii and nigriceiis. Its aflSnities are 

 reall}' closest with the last named. Although nigriceps and t7'istis 

 do not sufBcientl}' resemble each other to render special com- 

 parison necessar}', the}' are still evident geographical representa- 

 tives — tristis holding the same relation to the insular forms with

 laivrencii, which it replaces in Northern South America.

' It is very curinus to ol)serve that most of the above distinguished authors, 

 finding that the West Indian rfica/-t>a<a of Lamarck, Gnx'lin, and Chemnitz 

 is distinct from the European dinirinita of Linn., have eaeh immediately 

 recliristened tlie former without troubling themselves to a.sc<Ttain whether 

 any one else had previously made tlic same discovery. To this carelessness, 

 and to the itisdne desire to describe sjtecies, are to be ascrilu-d the terrors of 

 the science to the novitiate, who in nine cases out of ten is frightened at 

 the very threshold b}- an heterogeneous mass of a hundred tlmusaiid names, 

 representing probably not more thau one-fifth that number of species. Long 

 and familiarly known to Conchologists as tliis species is they have per- 

 mitted nearly all of the above synonyms to stand as distinct species. The 

 geographical range is great, but well established by numerous authorities.

SHELLS OF HEKKIMEE AND ADJACENT COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF 



NEW YORK. 



BY JAMES LEWIS. 



At various times I have prepared catalogues and other papers 

 relating to the shells of this region. The latest catalogues of 

 shell-bearing mollusca of Herkimer and adjacent counties was 

 printed in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences 

 in 1860. Since that date several species have been found which 

 previously had not been noticed. Corrections have also been 

 made of species wrongl}' named. 



A few rare land-shells have been detected in obscure retreats, 

 where the progress of civilization has not reached them. For con- 

 venience of reference I arrange the species alphabetically, Avithout 

 following the most recent classification, my object being geogra- 

 phical distribution rather than classification. 



Amnicola Cincinnatiensis T Anthony. 



Erie Canal and ^lohawk River. In the rivers, this shell some- 

 times attains remarkable size. Specimens submitted to Mr. Tryon 

 were pronounced to be Cincinnatiensis or iieiv. I do not feel dis- 

 posed to quote this as a new species on account of its size, for the 

 reason that other shells not recognized as new species sometimes 

 attain remarkable size in tliis region. 



A. lustrica, Say. 



Schuyler's Lake, Otsego County; Little Lakes, Herkimer 

 County; Smith's Pond, Litchfield, Herkimer County; Erie Canal. 



The shells found in Erie Canal are doubtlessly- introduced. 

 Have been seen there only on one occasion (1800). 

 A. pallida, IlaM. 



Lakes, rivers, and canal. I can distingui.sh these sliells from 

 those shells of Massaciiusctts called A. jiorala, Sa}', by Gould, 

 only by their color, due to localit}-. 



Ancylus fuscas, Adams. 



Schuyler's Lake and Little Lakes, New York. 

 Ancylus parallelus, Hal J. 



Schuyler's Lake and Little Lakes, New York.

98 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



Ancylus tardus, Say. 



Mohawk River. Found under stones along the margin of the 

 stream at low water. I have found them onl^' during the fall 

 months. Xone could be found in 1871. 

 Anodonta edentula, Say. 



Mohawk River and Erie Canal ; also streams running south to 

 the Susquehanna River. 



Anodonta fluviatilis, Lea. 



In ponds and streams near Schuyler's Lake. 

 Anodonta imbecilis, Say. 



Erie Canal. Very scarce and small. 

 Anodonta lacustris, Lea. 



Schuyler's Lake, Little Lakes, Smith's Pond, and a small pond 

 at Herkimer. A small variety occurs in a marshy creek on the 

 hills eight miles south of Mohawk. 



Anodonta Lewisii, Lea. 



Erie Canal and Mohawk River. During the last ten years this 

 species has been very nearly exterminated in the canal, affected, no 

 doubt, by chemicals introduced in the armory sewage at Iliou. 

 Anodonta subcylindracea, Lea. 



Erie Canal, Mohawk River, and ponds at Herkimer. ]S[ot 

 abundant. 

 Anodonta undulata. 



Erie Canal and Mohawk River. Scarce. 

 Bythinella obtusa, Lea. 



p]rie Canal and Mohawk River. Hi the rivers this species some- 

 times grows very large ; it is usually much larger here than spe- 

 cimens I have seen from other localities. 

 CarycMum exiguum, Say. 



On moist land in the Valley of the Mohawk. I have not found 

 it abundant elsewhere. 



Goniobasis livescens, Menke. 



Erie Canal and Mohawk River. The shells var3^, exceedingly, 

 under the influences of station. The shells are characterized 

 here as elsewhere by a weak epidermis, easily worn off. The 

 species has, no doubt, been introduced from western waters by 

 way of the canal. It is extremely abundant on rocks and hard- 



[July 16, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PniLADELPIITA. 99 



clay banks in the Mobawk Pviver, preferring swift water. I liave 

 no doubt a variety of this species furnished the type of ^Mr. Tryon's 

 Gon. Haldemani. 



Goniobasis virginica, Gmelin. 



Common enougli in the canal at long intervals. Has no doubt 

 been introduced since 185G. Is said to abound in the Hudson 

 River, and in streams near Buffalo. Is very seldom found in the 

 Mohawk River. 



In 1871 I found specimens which attain ncarl3- the size of adults 

 of this species, but which exliibit colors and forms somewhat 

 inilike it. They seem to blend the colors of Trypanoi^toma sub. 

 ulare and Goniohasis livescens, and approximate the form and 

 size of Gon. virginica. I am persuaded by the circumstances 

 attending them tliat the}' are 7i^6rzV/s, and proliably derived from 

 Gon. virginica, and perhaps both the other two moUusca just 

 named. The supposed hybrids are not found apart from virginica. 

 Feeling unwilling to assume tlie responsibility of suggesting hy- 

 hridity in a case which others might have settled by proposing a 

 new species, I submitted specimens to Mr. Charles M. Wheatley 

 for his opinion. I feel privileged to say that Mr. AVheatley assents 

 to ni}' view respecting the shells. 

 Helix albolabris, Say. 



A common species. A variety with a tooth is found in the 

 town of Litchfield. A single reversed specimen was found near 

 ]\rohawk in June, 18T1. 

 Helix alternata, Say. 



This is the most abundant Helix of this region. It docs not 

 offer any notable varieties. 

 Helix arborea, Say. 



Formerly somewhat abundant, but now extremely rare in the 

 valley of the Mohawk. 

 Helix chersina, Sny. 



Damp grounds along the valley of the Mohawk. This species 

 is rare, and very few have been seen for man}' 3cars. 

 Helix concava, Say. 



Somewliat al)un(lant in damp ravines. 

 Helix dentifera, Binney. 



Found in ravines in tlie town of Litchlicld (ls71). Only a very

100 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



few specimens have been found. Some of these have the reflected 

 margin of the aperture of a beautiful rose color. 



Helix electrina, Gould. 



Formerly abundant, but now quite scarce. 

 Helix fallax, Say. 



Two specimens from Litchfield (ISVl), appear to belong to this 

 species. They differ essentially from the variety of tridentata 

 found here — heretofore regarded as fallax. 



Helix fuliginosa, Griffith. 



Abundant in some of the ravines in Litchfield. 

 Helix hirsuta, Say. 



I have never found this species. Col. E. Jewett, of TJtica, in- 

 forms me he had found it several years ago near New Hartford. 



Helix indentata, Say. 



Alwaj's rare. It has not been found for several years. 



Helix intertexta, Binney. 



Found in ravines and on hillsides shaded by poplars. It is not 

 a very abundant species, but may usually be obtained in the 

 months of July and August. 



Helix ligera, Say. 



I have found a single specimen only. Dr. William Brown, of 

 Litchfield, has half a dozen specimens taken from under an old 

 fence on a hill in Litchfield. The shells are smaller than typical 

 ligera and the apex is less pointed. It may be placed between 

 typical Zigrera- and demissa, and seems to identify these forms as 

 varieties of one type. 



Helix lineata, Say. 



A rare species. Scarcely twenty living specimens have been 

 found since L854. [Since the above was written. Dr. Brown has 

 presented numerous specimens found in Litchfield.] 



Helix inomata, Say. 



Common in ravines. Apparently more abundant than in former 

 years. 



Helix minuscula, Binney. 



A rare species. Wet land in the Mohawk Yalley. 



[July 16, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 101 



Helix minutissima, Lea. 



A few specimens have been found in Litchfield h}- Dr. Brown 

 (1871). 

 Helix nitida, Mull. 



Usuall}- found abundantly on wet ground, near streams, ponds, 

 and lakes. More common in the valle}^ of the Mohawk. 



Helix palliata, Say. 



Xot abundant. Occurs somewhat more plentifully in the Litch- 

 field ravines than elsewhere. 

 Helix perspectiva, Say. 



Litchfield; very scarce. (1871.) 

 Helix pulchella, Meill. 



Common on damp soil in many localities. 

 Helix Sayii, Binney. 



Common in ravines, but not so abundant as to be found with- 

 out laborious search. 



Helix striatella, Anthony. 



Sometimes very numerous in the A'alley; usually not abundant 

 elsewhere. 



Helix tridentata, Say. 



A small variety. Common in ravines. 

 Helix thyroides, Say. 



Seen only in the Mohawk Yallc}'. Col. Jewett, of Ltica, finds 

 this species abundant and associated with albolahris by the side 

 of the railroad embankment, seven miles east of Utica. The few 

 specimens I have found occurred in an alder swamp west of the

 in the Erie Canal, spring of ISH. Probably introduced from 

 Cayuga Lake.? 



Lymnaea umbilicata, Adams. 



None have been seen for man}' years. All that have been found 

 inhabited a pool of stagnant water in a Avood lot that has long 

 since been cleared, and the pool dried up. 



Margaritana marginata, Say. 



Erie Canal and Mohawk River ; not abundant. 

 Margaritana rugosa, Barnes. 



More abundant than the preceding, in the same localities.

 Schuyler's Lake. 



Melantho decisus, Say. 



Inhabits Schuyler's Lake and Little Lakes without any asso- 

 ciate species. Found also in the Erie Canal and Mohawk River 

 with the two species next named. A few reversed specimens have 

 been found. 



Melantho integer. Say. 



The opercle of the adult has the form of that of 31. pondei'osiis 

 Say. I am inclined to regard these shells as varieties of x>onde^ 

 rosiis. Reversed and malformed specimens occur sometimes in 

 considerable numbers in the Erie Canal. Largest shell found is 

 over two inches long. 



Melantho rufus, Haldeman. 



This species, as well as integer, has evidently been introduced

here, but at a more recent date. No shells of this species have 

 been found here earlier than 1855, since which time they have 

 gradually increased in size and numbers. The largest shell j-et 

 found is 1,83 inches long. It is in the collection of Mr. Charles 

 M. Wheatley, of Phoeuixville, Pa. 

 Physa heterostropha, Say. 



Common in rivers and streams; also in stagnant water. Some 

 of the varieties simulate the forms of gyrina^ancillaria^ and Inte-

The shells of this region are between ventricosum and suhrotun-

 a stagnant pool near Mohawk, and from Little Lakes.

 abundant than any other mollusc in the canal. 



Spliserium croceum, Lewis. 



I described this species many 3'ears ago. Mr. Prime puts it in 

 the sj-nonyms of one of his species (.S'. secure). Since the publi- 

 cation of Mr. Prime's papers I have had opportunity to study >S'. 

 croceum, and find it in very different circumstances from those 

 which determine tbe habits of S. secure, typical specimens of which 

 I have collected in Massachusetts. My shells are found usually 

 in coarse angular gravel anchored b^' a byssus. They are more 

 abundant in a small stream that connects the two " Little Lakes" 

 in the south part of this county than elsewhere.

[July 16, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PKILADELPniA. 105 



Sphaerium rosaceum, Prime. 



This shell I proposed as " Cyclas errans,''^ a number of j'cars 

 ago. Mr. Prime puts it in his sj-nonymy of S. roaaceum. It seems 

 to me, however, that the habits of this mollusc are more like those 

 of S. parlumeium^ Sa^-, which species is usually found in stagnant 

 water, while Mr. Prime's rosaceum is a river shell. My shells are 

 the most fragile of their class that I have seen. From ni}- present 

 knowledge of species and their habits, I am induced now to reclaim 

 m}' species. I have found these shells usually adhering to the 

 trunks of the " dwarf button-ball" growing in a stagnant pool ; a 

 more solid variety sometimes occurs in ditches. 



Sphaerium Bimile, Say. 

 Lakes. Abundant. 



Sphaerium solidulum, Prime. 



Mohawk Kiver. Xot plent}'. 



Sphaerium striatinum, Lamarck. 



Mr. Sa3's descrij^tion of Cyclas edentula, if read with the nn- 

 derstanding that his idea of the anterior and posterior of bivalves 

 was the reverse of the present usage, will be found to accord to 

 the shells here referred to. This species occurs in the outlet of 

 Schuyler's Lake, in sicift water among gravel, while S. simile 

 occurs in still water in mud in the same stream. A recent writer 

 supposes striatinum to be the young oi! simile. This is an error. 

 S. striatinum occurs as far east as the Connecticut River at Spring- 

 field, Massachusetts, and is found in many of the larger streams 

 in Xew York, Ohio, and States westward. Is ver}- abundant in 

 the Erie Canal, less so in the Mohawk Kiver. It has been found 

 in Oneida Lake. (F. E. Spinner.) 



Sphaerium transversum, Say. 



Sometimes abundant in the canal. A few may be found in late 

 summer months in the Mohawk River. Evidently a western si)e- 

 cies, introduced, though known since 1853 to inhabit the canal. 



Succinea aureaT Lea. 



A small, orange-colored species found sometimes' in the month 

 of June around the " Little Lakes" may be aurca. The species 

 has not been authoritatively determined. 



Succinea avara, Say. 



A huge variety, sometimes 11-20 inch long, is found on the moist 

 muddy banks of the Mohawk River, sometimes very plenty, some-

times rare. Smaller shells abound along water-margins on the 

 hill regions south, at Little Lakes, and at Schu^'ler's Lake. Pf. 

 Brown finds it in Litchfield. 



Succinea obliqua, Say. 



Damp, shaded grounds along the Mohawk. This species is 

 sometimes found on vegetation and trees, several feet from the 

 ground. S. Toileniana, Lea, has similar habits, and has been found 

 on apple-trees or hill-sides near woods. 



Succinea ovalis, Gould. 



Margins of ditches, river banks, lake-shores, &c. Sometimes 

 very abundant. 



Succinea Totteniana, Lea. 



Inhabits ravines and hill-sides, wooded. Is nearly as large as 

 obliqua, and has similar arborial habits.

 and in streams emptying into the lake. 



TInio Tappanianus, Lea. 



Mohawk River. Abundant only at times. Some cause not un- 

 derstood makes them scarce only in exceptional seasons, as is the 

 case with man}' other molluscs. 



Valvata tricarinata, Say. 



Erie Canal, Mohawk River, Schu3der's Lake, and Little Lakes. 

 In " Little Lakes" the shells are varied ; bicarinata and simplex. 

 occurring as prevailing forms in the upper lake ; along the marsh}- 

 borders V. sincera^ Say, occurs. I am disposed to believe sincera

 the usual forms to the influence of station. " V. sincera'^ is found 

 in mart' lies in Michigan.

Sometimes f'^und alive in bogs. Oftencr found dead in the high- 

 water drift floated into windrows b^- the river. 



Vitrina limpida, Gould. 



In November and December, 18C4, I found iraraen.se numbers 

 of large, fine specimens of this Vitrina along the sliaded slopes of 

 a ditch on the flats near Mohawk. The soft parts were very dark. 

 Since that time no specimens of Vitrina have been seen near Mo- 

 hawk tliough lepeated search has been made for them. Dr. Brown, 

 of Litchfield, finds Vitrina in his yard. His residence is on a rich 

 soil, the eastern slope of a hill, at an elevation supposed to l)e 

 about 1200 feet above the sea-level. His specimens are not nu- 

 merous, l)ut are apparent!}' perennial.'

SHELLS OF TENNESSEE. (No. 2.) 

 BY JAMES LEWIS, M.D. 



Since the publication of my papers on tlie Shells of the Holston 

 River, and on the Laud Shells of Tennessee,' a few supplementary^ 

 species have come to my notice, and conclusions have been reached 

 respecting some of the operculate univalves that occur in the small 

 streams and springs of Knox, Blount, Monroe, and adjoining 

 counties in Tennessee. In this paper conclusions are presented 

 as to what seem to be, with only one or two exceptions, known 

 species. For the identification of species and varieties in several 

 instances thanks are due to Mr. Lea, Mr. Wheatley, Dr. Hartman, 

 and others. Too much credit cannot be awarded to the enterprise 

 and interest with which Miss Law has extended her explorations.

Holston River. No specific name was suggested for this shell 

 in my previous paper. It may possibly be A.obscui'us, Ilald.; if 

 so, the two names are probably sjaionyms. 



LAND SHELLS. 

 Helix arborea, Say. 



Blount and Monroe Counties. Yerj^ scarce. 

 Helix clausa, Say. 



Blount County. Among fort3^ specimens was one having all 

 the features of H. Mitchelliana, Lea. 



Helix demissa, Binney. 



The typical form is scarce. The few I have secured are small 

 and pale. The larger shell of this group, which in my previous 

 paper I treated as a variet3^ of ligera, is proportionally a little 

 more elevated and decidedl}' yellow. Mr. W. G. Binney, I am in- 

 formed, regards it as a varietj^ of demissa. It is apparently as 

 distinct from the typical demissa as sculpHJis, Bland, is from in- 

 dentata Saj'. This consideration induces me to reclaim for the 

 larger shell the name acerra, hesitatingly'' suggested in my previous 

 paper. I have a single specimen in no respect distinguishable 

 from the typical demissa except by two teeth, within, as in 

 gulains. 



Helix gularis, Say. 



In my endeavors to find young specimens of this species among 

 the numerous shells sent hy Miss Law, I am constrained to regard 

 as such tlie small depressed shells which in m}' former paper I re- 

 ferred to supp7-essa. The shells hitherto regarded as suppressa 

 differ so essentially from undoubted specimens of that species from 

 Pennsylvania that I cannot unite them. Among the shells of this 

 type from Miss Law appear to be three varieties of gulaiHs differ- 

 ing in size, form, and elevation. A fourth form is more polished 

 and subglobose, with the umbilicus entirely' closed. It may be 

 hereafter separated as a distinct species.

 carinate above. I have separated from it all pUeate-striate shells 

 that iiave been referred to this species b}' my correspondents. 

 The largest shells occur in loc. 8 ; they are also variable, souie of 

 them passing through phases referable to the next species to forms 

 entirely free from striatious and carina?. The most perfect forms 

 occur in loc. 17. 

 Trypanostoma Estabrookii, Lea. 



Localities, 2, 4, 8, 10, 18. The shells of loc. 18 are very fine, 

 perfect, and slender ; and have been referred b}" a correspondent 

 to T. unciale. The shells of loc. 10 are small and imperfect. 



Goniobasis arachnoidea, Anthony. 



Localities, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 10, 13, 17, 18, 10, 21, 23, 25, 27, 28, 20, 

 35, 30, 37, 43. The local varieties are ver^' perplexing, and some 

 of them could not have been identified but for the aid deriveil from 

 shells of other localities. Some of the various forms have been 

 referred to Try. unciale ; others to Gon.haculum : some of the 

 more slender varieties have been referred to Gon. corinifera^ Lam. 

 The shells of one locality (23) have been called iiu undcscribed 

 species of Tnjpanosloma. Of two otlier loealities (2S, 43) the 

 shells have been supposed to be anotln-r undescribed species of 

 Trypanostoma. These shells bear a strong resemblance to Mr.

Shells of loc. 10 bear a strong resemblance to Mr. Lea's figure 

 of T. Sycamorense, from which they are (by i^nplication) supposed 

 to be distinct. 



Some of the least plicate specimens of loc. 2 are very like Mr. 

 Lea's figure of Melania oblita, and, of course, have been referred 

 to Try. unciale b}^ my correspondents. I unhesitatingly refer 

 Mr. Anthony's llel. haculum as a synonym to Gon. a?'achnoidea ; 

 baculum being the adult form, a7-ach)widea the immature form ; 

 arachnoidea has priority; but at the same time I think a careful 

 stud}' of the various shells which may ^''ct be identified with arach- 

 noidea will result in assigning priority to some other name.

Localities, 2,4, 11, 13, 15,18, 22, 24, 32. This is also a variable

 fordii. Lea, and aterina^ Lea. Usually this species is much 

 eroded. 



Goniobasis castanea, Lea. 



Localities, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 14, 16, 18, 21, 24, 26, 31, 37, 45. Lo- 

 calities 2, 4 produce shells, the upper whorls of which are smooth; 

 all the other localities produce shells which, when perfect, are 

 slightly but variably carinate above. Some of the varieties have 

 been referred to Gon. difficilis, Lea; but as that species is "obso- 

 letely plicate" on the upper whorls, the reference does not seem to 

 have been well considered. Localities 30, 31 produce decallate 

 shells that bear a strong resemblance to figures of Gon. pulla, 

 Lea, but possibl}'' not identical. Some of the varieties have been 

 referred to " 3IeL simplex, Say." I am not able to sa^' the iden- 

 tificatitm is conclusive.

 that the comparison of large suites of specimens would result in 

 a wholesale reduction of the species. Some of the earlier species

122 TROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



May T. 

 Mr. Yaux, Vice-President, in the chair. 

 Twelve members present. 



Mr. Thomas G. Gentry called the attention of the Academy to 

 what he regarded as a rare and remarkable case of hybridism, 

 which occurred between Macacus nemestrinus, male, and Macacus 

 cynomolgus, female. After exhibiting an alcoholic specimen of 

 the j-oung, and a stuffed specimen of the mother which w^as clearly 

 identified as Macacus cynomolgus, he detailed the leading charac- 

 ters of the two parents. 



He stated that the male differed from the female in being more 

 robust and of greater dimensions; in the almost perfect smoothness 

 of the face, which is of a pale flesh color, while in the female it is 

 black and invested with a close growth of short black hairs; in the 

 absence of a crest upon the head of the male, which is a prevailing 

 characteristic of the species (31. nemestrinus)^ and its presence in 

 the female, which is a prominent feature of the species to which she 

 belongs; in color; and, lastl}', in the unequal development of the 

 caudal appendage, which in the male is about seven inches in 

 length, and densely clothed with long hairs, while in the female 

 it is more than twice the lengtli, and nearly naked for more than 

 two-thirds of its extent. 



He further said that there could be no doubt of the genuineness 

 of the case, as the two had been isolated from all other monkey's 

 during the past two years. 



He also called the attention of the Academy to a fact which he 

 believed not to be generally known, and which goes far to show 

 the close relationship between the Bimana and Quadrumana. In 

 this instance, the menstrual flow, as sometimes occurs in the 

 human species, continued at the regular periods up to the time of 

 birth. 



May 14. 



The President, Dr. Rtjschenberger, in the chair. 



Twenty-seven members present. 



The following paper was presented for publication : — 

 " Notice of some Crustacea from the Island of St. Martin, W. I. 

 Collected by Dr. Tan Kijgersma." By T. Hale Streets, T. S. K 



Mr. Thomas Meehan observed that on several occasions, before 

 the Academy and other scientific bodies, he had offered some facts 

 and suggestions tending to prove that what are popularly" termed 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 123 



Pine needles are not properly leaves, but rather brauchlets, ■which, 

 through the real leaves becoming attached for neail}' their whole 

 length to the axis or stem, had of necessity taken on themselves 

 the offices of leaves. He believed that many botanists had coin- 

 cided with his views; but some very distinguished ones, among 

 others he believed his esteemed friend Prof. Asa Gra}-, did not feel 

 warranted in fully agreeing with him. He was rather glad of this 

 hesitation, because it was an incentive to liim to continue his 

 observations and searches for new facts which might either 

 weaken or confirm his original views. 



He now wished to offer to the Academy two additional obser- 

 vations in favor of the axial origin of these so-called leaves. 



In plants in general the leaves unfolded contemporaneously 

 with the branches or axes. He could not call to mind an instance 

 where the axis first extended to its full length before the leaves 

 ventured to push forth from the nodes. The axial buds usually 

 remained dormant until this final length was approached. "When 

 this occurred, or if anytliing happened to destroy the apex of the 

 growing shoot, then the axial buds pushed into growth, and never 

 to any great extent before. In the Pine famih' we had the follow- 

 ing axial experience. The buds which bore the needles were axial 

 buds, situated at the base of the scale — the adnated leaf as he 

 maintained. These buds remained nearl}' at rest until the axis 

 had reached its full length, and in this respect coincided with the 

 axial buds of trees in general. A pine tree in the spring season 

 presented the appearance of an immense chandelier, with its long 

 axial shoots as the naked burners. In this respect it is apparent 

 that, regarding the fascicles of pine needles as brauchlets, the 

 law of folial development coincidental with axial growth finds no 

 exception in the Pine family. 



The next striking consideration was one derived from the 

 nature of the infiorescence. In vegetable morpholog}', the fioral 

 system of j)lants was made n\) of neither leaf nor axis separately, 

 but conjointh' of both. In the inflorescence of the pine, the male 

 catkins each took the place of a fascicle. The axial bud at the 

 base of the leaf scale, instead of a Ijuncli of needles, developed as 

 a si)ike of flowers. This spike or catkin is metamorphosed nee- 

 dles. If these needles were leaves merely, we could hardly ex- 

 pect inflorescence to be formed from tliem. It would be an excep- 

 tion to regular rule. Put regarding the needles of the i)ine as 

 rather axis than leaf, their devulopment to flowers accords with 

 general law; and he held that it was more philosophical to accept 

 conclusions based on general law, than to hunt for new laws to 

 account for apparent exceptions to geiicral rule. 



For his own i)art he felt there needed no further reasoning than 

 he had oflercd at previous times; but he thought perhaps those 

 additional suggestions might have wi'iglit with other minds that 

 had not yet decided as fully as he had done. 




124 proceedings of the academy op 



May 21. 

 The President, Dr. Rusciienberger, in the chair. 



Thirty members present. 



The following papers were presented for publication : — 

 " Notes on Lingual Dentition of certain species of North Ameri- 

 can Land Shells." By Thos. Bland and Wm. G. Binney. 



" On a new California Pulmonata." B}' John G. Cooper, M. D. 



Prof Cope called attention to the anterior curvature of the 

 horn in the common deer Gariacus virginianus, and said it was a 

 point of interest to determine whether the true axis or beam was 

 curved forwards or not. On comparison with the Gariacus ma- 

 crotis of the plains, it was found that the true beam was partly 

 erect and was branched (as already shown b}^ Baird) while an 

 anterior snag was directed forward, marking exactly the curved 

 line of the axis of the G. virginianus. The curvature of the latter 

 was then shown to be due to the predominant development of 

 this large anterior snag, and the partial suppression of the true 

 beam. 



He then exhibited a spike or second year's horn of the G. ■vir- 

 ginianus, and alluded to the occasional occurrence of permanent 

 spike-horned deer in the Adirondack region of New York. He 

 said Alexander B. Lamberton, a gentleman who had spent much 

 time in that region, confirmed the statements that had been made 

 as to their existence, but said that they were rare. He then ex- 

 hibited a pair of simple beams or spikes of three feet in length, 

 which had been taken from a black-tailed deer (G. macrotis) shot 

 within three miles of the Kansas Pacific R. R. in Kansas. They 

 had evidentlj' belonged to an adult animal, and Avere the first ex- 

 amples of spike-horned deer of that species which had been re- 

 corded. 



Prof. Cope further remarked that observation on varieties and 

 variation was at the basis of a true system of creation, and that 

 while it was often necessary for the sake of systematic clearness to 

 unite many varieties under one specific head, we did not in this 

 way escape their recognition and study. He said that the neces- 

 sary exactness of systems had concealed from many the fact as 

 well as the meaning of variation. 



There were and had been for years two schools of naturalists, 

 whose modes of treating natural history subjects were quite 

 different. In reference to these modes, they might be called 

 the technical and natural schools. As, however, the claim of the 

 latter to better appreciation of natural affinities and classifica- 

 tions appeared to him to be doubtful, he thought they had 

 better be called the x)seudo-natural school, while the so-called 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 125 



technical naturalists were sucli on account of their pursuing au 

 analytic method. The psoiulo-natural school decided on the 

 affinities of organic t^-pcs 1)3- their "pli^-siognomv" or their /acies 

 habit and the lilvc, reading nature witli an artist's C3'e, and at- 

 taining opinions of systems without the trouble of much ana- 

 tomical study. They protested against the strict adhesion to 

 "technical" (or structural) characters, saying that they violate 

 " natural affinities" oftener than support or ex[)ress them. Thus 

 their systems become physiognomical, and please the eye by 

 their appearance, rather than the mind by their expression of ex- 

 act structural relations ; in accordance with this S3'stem, species 

 were always well distinguished, and could not have been derived 

 from common parents, but that nevertheless everything "runs 

 together," and that the higher groupings are mainly " opiniona- 

 tive," — in fact, tliat, although nature has a beautiful system, we 

 do not 3'et understand it, and that it is "too soon to generalize." 

 Periiaps this obscurity has its advantages, as it certainly shelters 

 in its profundities any theur}^ of creation its supporters may 

 choose to adopt. Hence the3' might be called the Anseslhetic 

 school, or tiie Anasstheniasls {nv ai.i')r,ii). 



The unnatural school think that the wa^"- of determining the 

 origin and relations of an object is to ascertain of what it is com- 

 posed. This was to be accomplished by analj'sis of all its ap- 

 pearances, and an account taken of every character. In tiiis way 

 the structure is learned, and a S3'stem based on anatomy* is estab- 

 lished. As anatomical s^^stems are unnatural, and anatomical 

 characters very difficult to discover by the anjxisthesiasts, they 

 regard such systems with disfavor, although tliey admit tliat they 

 constitute tlie onl3' correct classification of bones, teeth, brains, etc. 

 The anal^'sts even find that species having very close specific 

 relationsinps occasionally present dilTerent generic characters. 

 This was proof positive to the Ana_*sthesiasts of the errors of the 

 technical school, liut it was still less to their credit that tliey laid 

 stress on variations and monstrosities, whicli were mere accidents. 

 The fact that the analyzers believed in the development of species, 

 showed their s^'stems to be unnatural. 



The sjieakcr did not take sides, but observed- that, in order to 

 ascertain the relations of a species, he usually examined it first. 



Mr. Thomas Meehan said he had recently read, in tiie published 

 Proceedings of the American JMulosopliical Society, the report of 

 a discussion l)etween Professor Cope and ]Slr. Kli K. Price in re- 

 gard to the Hypothesis of Evolution. Mr. Price appeared to lay 

 much stress on tiie assumed fact that variations were rather the 

 result of interference by art with the rcguhir fiow of natural hvws, 

 and that it was therefore unphilosophical to attempt to found :iny 

 theory of evolution on tlie facts of variation. 



For himself he might say, that no theory of development, so far 




126 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



as he had been able to understand them, had satisfied his mind ; 

 but that there was a continual growth of form, wholl}^ unaided by 

 man or any external agency, he thought fully warranted b}' nume- 

 rous facts. He believed that this natural and inherent growth 

 force in relation to form, was greater than even some who believed 

 they understood the laws governing evolution were disposed to 

 admit. Not only intelligent minds like that of Mr. Price, but even 

 evolutionists, like Professor Gray and Dr. Engleman — judging 

 from the last edition of the 3Ianual of Botany^ seemed indisposed 

 to allow great power to inherent change ; for whenever a marked 

 change occurred, and there happened to be distinct forms at each 

 end of the line, we find the fact assumed that such change could 

 only occur by outside influences. Thus we find in a recent notice 

 of JRubus neglectus of Peck, the expression " hybrid ?" Also in 

 relation to the oaks Quercus tridentata, Q. quinqueloba, Q. Leana, 

 Q. heterophylla, "probably some or all of them hybrid ;" and so on 

 in other instances. 



He wished to claim no credit for any particular original dis- 

 coveries, but thought it had fallen to his fortune perhaps as much 

 as to that of any one, to remark that art both in the animal and 

 vegetable world had had more credit awarded to it in the matter of 

 change than it was entitled to. He had shown long ago in the 

 American Naturalist., that even in the production of double flowers, 

 usuall3^ deemed peculiarly the privilege of the florist, nature herself 

 was the peer of the gardener. He had shown by direct evidence that 

 some things had been found double in a Avild state, and the great 

 probability that the double forms of so many species of such a 

 common thing as the Butter-cup (Ranunculus), and other weeds 

 never cultivated, originated naturally in the same way ; and in 

 numerous papers and remarks before this institution, and in other 

 places, he had shown that there was as great variation in those 

 genera which had only one species in a given localitj^, as there are 

 in the cases of the Oaks and Blackberries before referred to. At 

 the present moment he remembered especially a short paper in the 

 American Naturalist on the Ox-eye dais}' ( Chrysanthemum leucan- 

 themum) and in the Proceedings of the Academy on " Variations 

 in Epigoea repens," There are no " allied species" here to hybri- 

 dize with. They are far out of the way of cultivation. Neither 

 gardening nor hybridization can by any possibility have an^-thiug 

 to do with the great variations we see. 



But he would now ofler another contribution to this class of 

 facts. He had journeyed last summer several hundred miles 

 through the Pocky Mountains of Colorado, and had noted re- 

 markable variations in the only species of Oak hi that region, 

 Quercus Douglassii, or Q. Neo-mexicana of some authors. The 

 first plants he found of this occupied large clumps in flat open 

 spaces, and grew onl}' about three feet high. He felt sure he had 

 several species, and collected specimens accordingly. One form 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF nilLADELPHIA. 127 



had the loaves so miK-h like the Quercus Ccrris of Europe, that 

 branches of the two mixed together could seareel}- be sciiarated ; 

 others came near in their resemblance tlic Euroitoan Quercus 

 rohur ; and again some near Q. alha of our own countr}'. Did these 

 species grow there, Ave should assuredly have the remark by the 

 esteemed author of the " ^lanual." " Probably a hybrid between 

 Q. cerris and Q. alba." It was onl}- aftei" man}- successive days 

 of acquaintance with it, during which it liad ranged from a low 

 bush to a small tree — from leaves decpl}' lobcd to leaves almost 

 entire — from leaves of a deep shining grecii to leaves of a glau- 

 cous gray — trees with fruit pretty Avell matured, to others onl}' 

 just commencing to set tlieir fruit — from long to sliort peduncu- 

 lated, elongated to sub-rounded fruit — and so on tlirough otlier 

 changes — that lie was forced to tlie conclusion that he had but 

 one species to deal with, and such he believed would be the con- 

 clusion of any careful botanist. 



"Whatever may be ultimately' accepted as the correct theory of 

 evolution, the fact of evolution so great as to produce forms equal 

 to the most decided species could scarcely be disputed ; and this, 

 too, as such cases as this of Quercus Douglassii proved, entirely 

 removed from the hand of art, or the agency of hj'bridization.

 Thirtj'-six members present. 



Tlie following gentlemen were elected members of the academy: 

 Jos. H. Ogdcn, Jos. E. Gillingham, D. S. Ilolman, J. W. Miller, P. 

 P. Morris, and T. M. Drown, M.D. 



Mons. E. Riviere, of Menton, France, was elected a correspon- 

 dent. 



On favorable report of the committees, the following papers 

 were oi'dered to be printed. 



Permis><ion having been granted, Prof. Cope exhibited some 

 vertoljm? of a Plosiosauroid reptile and those of a smalloi' species, 

 probably a CJiilastes^ which were found in close proximity near 

 Sheridan, Kansas, by Joseph Savage, of Leavenworth. According 

 to this gentleman, tlie vertebral column of the Clidasfcs was found 

 immcdiatoh' l)elow that of the Plesiosauroid and in a reversed 

 position, as though it had been swallowed b}' the latter or larger 

 reptile. The largest vertebra' of the ('lidnti/rs were about three- 

 quarters the length and one-fourth the diameter of those of the 

 Plesiosauroid, and the animal must have furnished a large, or at 

 least a long, mouthful for its captor. The bones of the C'lidastes

were not in good condition, but resembled those of C. cineriarum, 

 Cope, though smaller. 



The Plesiosauroid was new to science, being the third species 

 discovered in the Cretaceous of the Xiobrara group. Specifically 

 it was nearest to the Elasmosaurus 2:)lat]jurus, Cope, but was 

 readily distinguished by the relatively shorter cervical vertebrae, 

 and the regular acute ridges on the exterior surfaces near the 

 margin of the articular faces, as well as the less contracted form 

 of all the vertebral centra. As tlie neural arches and the cervical 

 parapoph3'ses were not coossified with the centra, the species 

 was referred to the genus Plesiosaurus, with the name P. giiJo, 

 Cope, and the following description: — 



Specimen represented b}^ eleven cervical, thirteen dorsal, and 

 seven or eight otlier vertebrae, with portions of scapular and 

 pelvic arch and ribs. 



The cervicals are longer than wide, and considerably com- 

 pressed in form anteriorl}', but depressed posteriori}-; this is 

 partly due to pressure, but not wholl}', and it is likel}' that the 

 posterior centra are about as transverse as in CimoUnsaiirus 

 magnus, Leidy, while the anterior are relatively several times as 

 long. In the length the latter resemble the English Plesiosauri^ 

 in which the centra are also compressed. The compressed ante- 

 rior centra exhibit a ridge on the side above the middle. A more 

 massive ridge extends between the articular extremities at the 

 lower part of the side, and presents a pit for the parapophysis. 

 The pit for the neural spine is of nearly similar size. Where the 

 cervicals begin to be depressed, two foramina appear near together 

 on the inferior face, and the articular extremities displa}' an open 

 obtuse emargination below. They are also emarginate for the 

 neural canal above, so as to have a form approacliing a transverse 

 figure 8. In the large posterior cervicals the sides are contracted 

 both below and at the sides. In all the cervicals the articular 

 faces are a little concave, in the larger with some median con- 

 vexities. 



In none of the dorsals preserved are the diaphop3'ses seen to 

 issue from the centra, hence the}' are probabl}' not posterior iu 

 position. The centra soon become smaller than those of the 

 posterior cervicals, and are subronnd in section, with a well- 

 marked emargination for the neural canal. The sides are gently 

 concave, and are without angulation, but are marked near the 

 articular extremity with short, sharp, and regular undivided ridges, 

 eight in a half inch. The articular faces are slighll}- concave and 

 without ridges. There are the two inferior foramina, and one on 

 the lower part of each side. The articular face for the neural arch 

 is an oval pit extending the length of the centrum and inter- 

 rupted b}'' some transverse ridges near the middle. The vertebrae 

 diminish in size posteriori}'. Two centra, probably sacral, resem- 

 ble the dorsals, but present an extensive vertical articular surface

ou each side. This has raised edges and terminates above in the 

 longitudinal surface for the neural arch, having thus a X'Shape. 

 It narrows below to an obtuse point, and no doubt supported a 

 free diapophysis. 



The fragments of the ])elvic and scapular arches indicate that 

 the}' w^ere capacious. The clavicle inclosed a large foramen, was 

 rather narrow, and thickened on the inner edge. Its glenoid 

 surface was wide and sub-rhomboid. Some of the other bones 

 were quite thin.

Associated with these remains were those of a turtle of the 

 size of some of the large Cheloniidae of recent seas. The only por- 

 tions were the scapulo-procoracoid, the coracoid, and the mandible 

 nearly- comi)lete. Tlie two former were like those of Chchjdra ; 

 the procoracoid issuhig nearly at the articular extremity, and the 

 coracoid being of moderate elongation and much expanded dis- 

 tallj', and with nearly' straight axis. The mandil)iilar rami were 

 remarkably slender and with correspondingly short symphysis. 

 The tomia obtuse and directed outwards, the apex flat and obtuse. 

 Coronoid process slightly elevated ; articidar bone osseous. 

 Length coracoid .250 m.; diameter distally .080; distal width of 

 scapula .058; length ramus of mandible .150; length symphysis

The general characters of this form were thought to agree with 

 Cynorerciis, Cope, though the individual was larger than that 

 on which the C. incisus was established.

DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW SPECIES OF MARINE BIVALVE MOLIUSCA. 

 BY GEORGE W. TRYON, JR. 



1. Crassatella Adeline, Tryon. Plate 6, fig. 1. 



Shell ovate, triangular, anteriorly rounded, jDosteriorly pro- 

 duced ; umbones depressed, slightly undulated. Surface white 

 with brown rays, occasionally marked with cuneiform characters 

 of darker color under a thin dark brown epidermis; within choco- 

 late color, margins white without crenulations. 



Length 3, alt. 2.25, diam. 1.13 inches. 



Habitat, unknown. Museum of the Academj^ 



This species is nearly allied to C Antillarum, Reeve, but is 

 not so gibbous, and is more narrowly produced behind ; it is also 

 readijy distinguished by its peculiar colored markings. 



3. LuciNA (CoDAKiA) DiSTiNGrE^TDA, Trjon, Plate 6, fig. 3. 



Shell orbicular, depressed, disk-like, covered with flattened 

 radiating ridges which are crossed by numerous close-set, raised,

Habitat., Gulf of California. W. M. Gabb. Museum of the 

 Academy. 



This fine large species has been confounded, by Mr. P. P. 

 Carpenter and others, with an analogous West Indian species — 

 Lucina tigrina, Linn. It is readily distinguished, however, by 

 its flattened form and border, and more depressed ribs. 



3. Circe (Crista) eidivayicata, Tryon. Plate 6, fig. 2. 



Shell oblong-oval, thick, somewhat ventricose, sides declining 

 convexly and ventral margin slightly rounded, covered by radiating

]\[ale. This species is very closely allied to G. mordax, Smith. 

 The carapax is convex longitudinally and slightly so transversel}'. 

 The dorsal surface of the carapax is XQvy similar to that of G. 

 mordax. Like that species it is punctate, and the space between 

 the puncta is perfectly smooth. The regions are but faintly 

 marked out on the dorsum ; a prominent sulcus separates the gas- 

 tric and cardiac regions. The front is broad and dcflexcd. Its 

 dorsal surface is grooved in the medial line ; the tip is curved back- 

 ward and downward so as to be completel}' hidden when looked 

 at from above ; it is bifid. The front is marginatc above at the 

 l)oint Avhere it is curved backward. The upper edge of the supe- 

 rior orbital border is straiglit, but directed a little backward. The 

 ascent of the outer portion of the curved lower edge is much more 

 gradual and is longer than the inner portion of the same edge, 

 which is curved rapidly' downward. The raised margin of the 

 lower edge is finely denticulated. The antcro-lateral angle is some- 

 what projecting, and the anterior portion of the lateral border is 

 thin and straight. The margin is raised, and in some cases finely 

 denticulated. The posterior portion of it is curved inward and 

 terminates opposite the cardiac region. From the point where 

 the postero-lateral border turns inward, a line runs downward anil 

 backward in a curved manner to join the posterior border. In tiie 

 space left by the divergence of these two lines there is one, and in 

 some cases two, short plications. 



In the larger cheliped,the merus is triangular in form, the ante- 

 rior surface is smooth, tlie l)orders are granular or tnlirreulose, 

 and the superior surface is arcuate and crossed by short i)ccteni-

132 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



form lines, as is also the external surface. The superior and 

 external surface of the carpus is obscurely tuberculose, and the 

 inner surface is crossed by an oblique, smooth ridge. The basal 

 portion of the propodus is shorter than the digital. The superior 

 and external surface is covered thickly with small depressed tuber- 

 cles. On the superior surface these tubercles are distinct and are 

 separated by distinct intervals, but they become gradually smaller, 

 more numerous, and are thickly crowded together towards the in- 

 ferior border. A raised tuberculose margin extends from the 

 base of the propodal finger along the whole length of the inferior 

 border to the carpus. The inferior part of the inner surface is 

 minutely granulose, and is crossed by an oblique tuberculose ridge 

 W'hich extends to the evacuation for the reception of the carjius. 

 The space between this ridge and the base of the dactylus is 

 covered with tubercles. The superior edge is carinated ; from its 

 posterior part a tuberculate line curves downward around the 

 upper part of the depression into which the carpus folds. The 

 fingers are long and slender, smooth and punctate. The row of 

 tubercles along the inner margin of the prehensile edge of the 

 propodal finger curves upward behind the base of the dactylus. 

 The prehensile edge is armed with tubercles ; there is a large one 

 near the middle and another at the tip. The dactjdus is tubercu- 

 lose at its base ; its prehensile edge is also armed with tubercles ; 

 those in the median line are the largest. The tips are hooked. 

 In the ambulator}^ feet the merus is broad and compressed, and 

 the upper part of the superior surface is marked by pectin iform 

 lines; the fourth and fifth segments are hairy. 



The abdomen is similar to that of G. j^ugnax. The second and 

 third segments are broadest. The terminal segment is narrower 

 than the penultimate, and is arcuate in form. 



The female is distinguished from the male by being minutely 

 granulose on the dorsal surface of the carapax, and the carapax 

 is nearl}' plane transversely. 



Dimensions of the male. Length of the carapax .56-.65 in.; 

 breadth .3Y-.44 in. Length of the hand .74-1 inch. Length of 

 the carapax of the female .50-.53 in.; breadth .31-.o7 in. 



This species can be distinguished from O.pugnax by having the 

 anterior surface of the merus smooth, and a smooth oblique ridge 

 on the inner surface of the carpus. It differs from G. mordax in 

 not having the sujierior surface and the upper part of the external

sui'face obscurel}' tuberculose, nor is the inferior portion smooth. 

 The carapax in the female is nearly plane, and the lateral margins 

 of the branchial region are not tuberculose.

Dko.mia latch, II. Milne-Edwards. Ilist. Xat. des Crust., Vol. II. p. 174. 



Petrolisthes nodosxjs, Nov. sp. 



The carapax is broadly ovate, about as broad as long. It is 

 nearly plane from side to side, and convex from behind forward. 

 The anterior portion is nodulated ; the nodules are arranged in a 

 semicircular manner transversely across the dorsum from one 

 hepatic region to the other. There are two nodules, larger than 

 the otliers, placed in the centre behind and between the orbits. 

 The posterior portion of the carapax is indistinctly imbricated. 

 The front is prominent and deeply tridentated. The middle tooth 

 is the largest and triangular in shape, and ver}^ slightly more 

 prominent than the lateral ones. The lateral teeth arc broad ; 

 their outer margin is convex and the inner is concave; their apices 

 are directed inward. A shallow groove is in the middle of the front; 

 and there is also a groove on each side running doMii into the 

 lateral teeth. The superior margin of the orbit is intlated and 

 everted. The external angle is acute, but not prominent. The 

 eyes are large. The peduncles of the antenna? arc knobby-; the 

 first article presents an obtuse tooth on its anterior margin. 



The right chcliped was missing. Tiic left is large, compressed, 

 imbricated on the superior surface, and smooth on the inferior. 

 The hand is as long as the carapax ; the width is greater at its 

 junction with the dact3lus than where it joins the carpus. The 

 posterior margin is covered with a dense i)ubescence. Tlie dac- 

 tylus and propodus closely approximate, and their approximatetl 

 borders are finely denticulated. Their extremities are hooked. 

 The dact^lus presents a slight groove on its superior surfaee. The 

 carpus is shorter than the hand. The anterior margin is armed 

 with four large, serrated, and imbrie.itcd teeth ; the two middle 

 ones are the largest, and are united at tlieir l)ases; the external 

 tooth is smallest. The superior edge of the distal extremity of 

 the car[)us is dilated. There is a small tooth at the external angle ; 




134 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



and between the two angles are two rounded prominences. The 

 superior surface presents a well-marlved ridge witli a sulcus on 

 each side of it. 



The ambulatory feet are hairy : the third article is broad, com- 

 pressed, and imbricated. The color of the carapas and cheliped 

 is reddish. The length of the carapax is .025 of an inch. 



Petrolisthes jugosus, Nov. sp. 



The carapax is rotundo-ovate in outline, about as broad as long, 

 depressed, and smooth, or very lightly granular under the micro- 

 scope. The front is deflexed and trilobate. The lobes are rounded ; 

 the middle one is more prominent than the lateral ones. There is 

 a well-marked median furrow extending to the tip of the middle 

 lobe ; and a furrow on each side wiiich terminates at the anterior 

 border of the lateral lobes. The anterior border of the front pre- 

 sents a well-defined raised margin. The superior border of the 

 orbits is not inflated. The external angle is obtuse and not pro- 

 minent. The eyes are large ; the first article of the antennary 

 peduncle has a projection on its anterior border. 



The chelipeds are large, compressed, and granular ; the left is 

 larger than the right. The hand is as long as the carapax. Its 

 width is greater at its junction with the dactylus than where it 

 articulates with the carpus. The posterior border is pubescent. 

 The posterior part of the superior surface is broadly grooved, and 

 this groove is continued on the propodus. The anterior part of 

 the upper surface presents another slighter groove ; and a broad 

 ridge runs longitudinally along the centre of the same surface. 

 The carpus is shorter than the hand, and its anterior margin is 

 armed with five small teeth. Its upper surface is marked by three 

 longitudinal ridges. The posterior and external borders are di- 

 lated. The anterior angle of the merus is armed with a tooth. 



The ambulatory feet ai-e pubescent, and minutely granulated 

 under the microscope. The third article is compressed ; the fourth 

 and fifth articles are ridged on their upper surfaces, in their long 

 direction. The color is a reddish shade ; the chelipeds arc more 

 deeply colored than the carapax. The length of the carapax is 

 .019 of an inch.

NOTES ON LINGUAL DENTITION OF CERTAIN SPECIES OF NOETH 

 AMERICAN LAND SHELLS- 



BY THOMAS BLAND AND W. G. BINNEY. 



We are indebted to Miss Aunie E. Law, of Jalapa, Tennessee, 

 and to Mr. Ileniy Ilempbill, of Oakland, California, for the 

 specimens from whieli we extracted the jaws and lingual mem- 

 branes here described. 



ZOXITES L^YIGATUS, Pf. 



Jaw as usual in the genus. 



ZoxiTES ixTERTEXTUS, Binncy. 



The jaw and lingual membrane arc as usual in the genus. 



ZoxiTES DEMissrs, Blnncy. 



Jaw arched, ends attenuated, pointed; anterior surface smooth, 

 cutting edge with well developed sharp median projection. 



Lingual membrane as usual in the genus. Laterals above 

 eight in number on either side of central line. 



ZoNiTES LASMODON, Phillips. 



Jaw and lingual membrane as usual in the genus. 

 ZoxiTES ixTEUxrs, Saj'. 



The jaw and lingual membrane are those of Zonites (or Hya- 

 Una), and not of Helix, thus showing the generic position of the 

 species, which is not so well marked by the shell. 



The jaw is slightly arcuate, ends attenuated, pointed; median 

 beak-like prominence to the cutting edge. 



The lingual membrane is long and narrow. Central teeth 

 large, with a long median cusp. Laterals like the centrals, but 

 bifid, four in number, marginals aculeate. 



Patdla strigosa, Gould. 



Jaw long, low, slightly arcuate; anterior surface smooth except- 

 ing near the lower margin, where there are numerous, crowded, 

 subobsoletc ribs, or coarse strife, crencllating the cutting edge. 

 There is a very strong muscular attachment to the upper margin. 



The lingual membrane is as usual in the genus. (See fig. 1*20 of 

 L. and Fr. W. Shells, L) The marginal teetli are wide and low, 

 with one inner, long, obtuse, oblique denticle, and several short 

 side blunt denticles, obtusely rounded. 




136 PROCEEDINQS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



Patula cooperi, W. G. Biun. 



Lingual membrane as in Patula strigosa. 



Patula idahoensis, Newc. 



Tlie jaw very much resembles in form and in its crenellated 

 cutting edge that of Patula striatella. (See fig. 141 of L. and 

 Fr. W. Shells, part I.) Its anterior surface has coarse perpendicu- 

 lar strife or obsolete wrinkles, not well formed ribs. There is a 

 stout membranous attachment to the upper margin. Lingual 

 mem))rane as in Patula Hemi^hilli. (See Am. Journ. of Couch., 

 VL 247.) 



Patula perspectiya, Say. 



The jaw and lingual membrane are quite like those of P. stria- 

 tella. The ends of the jaw, however, are more squarely truncated, 

 and the strise are not converging. ' 



Helix polygyrella, Bland. 



Jaw slightly arcuate, ends but little attenuated, blunt; anterior 

 surface with fifteen broad ribs, denticulating either margin. 



Lingual membrane as in H. auriculata. 



We are indebted to Mr. Harford for the living specimens from 

 which the notes on this species are drawn. 



Helix palliata, Say. 



Jaw short, high ; anterior surface with more than fifteen ribs, 

 denticulating either margin. 



Helix obstricta, Say. 



Jaw with ten ribs. Lingual membrane as in H. palliata. 

 Helix deyia, Gld. var. 



This small, doubtful form from Salmon River, Idaho, has the 

 jaw arcuate, ends blunt, with about seven stout ribs denticulating 

 either margin. The lingual membrane is broad, teeth as usual in 

 the genus, the marginals low, wide, with one oblique, bluntly 

 bifid, inner denticle, and several short, blunt, outer denticles. 



Helix fidelis, Gray. 



In Amer. Journ. Conch., TI. p. 207, pi. ix. fig. 1, we described 

 and figured thejaw as short, high, thick, rough, strongly arcuate, 

 ends attenuated, blunt, cutting edge with a well developed, blunt, 

 median projection, marked with decided longitudinal strife, which 

 crenellate its margin. We have lately had an opportunity of 

 examining numerous other adult specimens, and find them decid- 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PUILADELPHIA. loT 



edly costate, usuallj' with about six ribs, deuticulating either 

 margin. 



Pallifeua dorsalis, Binncj'. 



Au opportunity has lately been given us b}' Mr. 11. Prime of 

 examining living specimens from Westchester Co., New York. 

 We find Mr. Morse's description and figure of the jaw to be quite 

 correct, and have no doubt of the genus being distinct from 

 Tebennophorus. The species appears to us well marked also, 

 especiall}^ by the great activity of the animal's motions. 



Mr. Prime noticed it climbing on trees, a habit often observed 

 by us in several of our land shells. Thus Helix thyroides in 

 the garden of one of us at Burlington, N. J,, constantly climbs 

 the fruit trees, to eat the gum which exudes from the branches. 



Our figure 535, of L. and Fr. W. Shells, part I., is defective. 

 The head does not extend bej'ond the mantle. See the upper

The President, Dr. Ruschenberger, in the chair. 



Tn-euty-two members present. 



The following papers were presented for publication : —

United States." By Isaac Lea. 



"A Contribution to the Ichthj^ology of Alaska." B}' Edw. D. 



Cope. 



Note on Gamasus of the Ox. — Prof. Leidy read an extract from 

 a letter from Dr. C. S. Turnbull, in which it was stated that the 

 Avriter had been misunderstood in relation to the Acarus of the 

 Ox, described in the Proceedings for January- 2d. He had seen 

 the cattle killed, and was positive that the mites occupied the 

 position in the ear of the steers while these were alive. Such 

 being the case, the acarus may be viewed as a parasite of the Ox, 

 and ma}' be specificalh' named Gamasus auris. 



Mr. Thomas Meehan presented some specimens of the common 

 asparagus, and remarked that in consequence of observing last 

 3'ear so many plants that had evidentl}" flowered, producing no 

 seeds, he had this j-ear examined them in a flowering condition 

 and found them perfectl}' dioecious. Imperfect stamens existed 

 in the female flowers, but they were never polleniferous. An occa- 

 sional g^-ncecium in the male flower would make a weak attempt 

 to produce a pistil, but no polleniferous flower ever produces a 

 fruit. There was a great diflTereuce in the form of the male and 

 female fluwers. The former were double the length of the latter, 

 and nearly cylindrical, while the female flower was rather cam- 

 panulate. Other observers had nearly made the discovery of 

 division in this plant. The old " English Botany" of Smith gave 

 it the character of being occasionall}' imperfect, and the authors 

 of" Deutchland Flora" considered it as occasionally Pol^-gamous. 

 But Mr. M. was satisfied from a half daj^'s investigation among 

 man}' plants that in this region at least the asparagus is never 

 perfect, but trul}' dia'cious. 



He had observed another matter, small, but which might be of 

 importance to systematic botanists, as well as to those engaged in 

 evolutionar}- studies. One flower had a quadrifid stigma, and a 

 four-celled ovary. The trinate type, or its multiple, is so closeh' 

 associated with the endogenous structure, that he considered this 

 circumstance particularly worthy of note. 



The male flowers seem very attractive to insects, various kinds 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PIIILADELPriTA. 139 



of which seem to feed on the pollen. The honey bee was a fre- 

 quent visitor. Xone seemed to be attracted to the female flowers. 

 In the division into separate sexes the plant had gained notliing 

 in tlie way of aid by insect fertilization. Fertilization seemed 

 wholly accomplished by the wind. The male flowers are produced 

 in mucli oreater abundance than the female ones. 



]\Ir. M. added that this discover}- had a more than usual practi- 

 cal importance. Man}' attempts had been made to improve tlie 

 asparagus, as garden vegetables and the farm cereals had been im- 

 proved ; but it had often l)een questioned whether these improved 

 forms would reproduce themselves from seed as other garden 

 varieties did. The tendencj- of thought the few past 3'ears had 

 been in the direction of the belief that permanent varieties could 

 be raised, and several improved kinds had been sent out by seeds- 

 men, and were popular to a considerable extent. He said he had 

 himself inclined to this opinion; but this discovery of complete 

 dia?cism in asparagus, whereby two distinct individual forms were 

 required to produce seed, rendered a true reproduction of one 

 original parent impossible, as the progeny' must necessarily par- 

 take of both forms. 



Mr. Meehan further said he had been requested by one of the 

 members. Professor Frazer, to call the attention of the Academy 

 to an orange on the table, which had produced a second smaller 

 fruit under the rind of the larger one. The orange externally 

 presented nothing unusual, but on being peeled the second one 

 was found of about one-fifth the size of the principal one, of a tur- 

 binate shape, and fitting into the lower larger one as into a cnp. 

 This \qiper secondary orange had the regular colored skin with 

 its endopleura, and the whole inclosed Ity the regular skin of the 

 primary- fruit. lie explained that a fruit was formed by the sud- 

 den arrestation of growth in a branch, and what wouhl be under 

 ordinary circumstances an elongated branch, with its several nodes 

 and axilhuy leaves and l)uds,is to form a fruit compressed and con- 

 densed, so to speak, into the organized mass we call a fruit. In 

 the orange before us, the central axis, after having had its elon- 

 gating direction arrested, made another feeljle departure onward, 

 and the small orange was the result. These sudden accelerations 

 of a ncarlv arrested growth are, though not common, sometimes 

 seen in fruits. They have hccn most frequently seen in the i)ear. 

 Here the renewed growth of tlie central axis bursts through the 

 primary cuticle as seen by the manner in which it is drawn up 

 with the secondary growth. He believed he had seen an instance 

 of a i)ear making three series of growths in one fruit. In the 

 larch it was (piite common to find a l)rauch arrested in its de- 

 velopment to form a cone, push out again into vigf)rous growth 

 at the apex, after resting as it were for nearly a month, while the 

 cone was forming. Tliese lareh cones, with l)ranches growing as 

 it were completely through them, are very olteii seen. Aiuaiilia-

ceous plants seem addicted to these irregularities. It was not 

 unusual to find several young seedling plants spring from one 

 orange seed.

 by him iu Kansas. As the writer had recently passed in review 

 much similar material, he was much interested iu Prof Marsh's 

 conclusions. These, he said, were of importance. In the first 

 place, he had ascertained that what was former!}' supposed to be 

 the inner side of the quadrate bone was the outer side, a conclu- 

 sion Prof. Cope thought entirely consistent with the other known 

 relations of the parts. 



Secoudl}'. He had discovered the stapes, and had entirely con- 

 firmed the opinion of the speaker, which Prof. Marsh had appa- 

 rently overlooked. This was stated as follows:' the quadrate 

 " is characterized by the presence of an oval pit. . . . Its use 

 is uncertain, but there is some probability that it received the 

 extremity of au osseous or cartilaginous styloid stapes. A groove 

 on the under side of the suspensorium would accommodate such 

 a rod, and in a position nearly similar to that which it occupies 

 in many of the Ophidia." It is iu precisely this position that 

 Prof. Marsh is so fortunate as to have discovered it. 



Thirdly. Prof Marsh believes that he has found the columella. 

 I have supposed it to be wanting, from the absence of its usual 

 points of attachment on the parietal and pterj-goid bones. It 

 remains to compare the bone found by Prof. Marsh with ali- and 

 orbito- sphenoid and ethmoid ossifications found in many sau- 

 rian s. 



Fourthly-. Prof. Marsh has observed the parieto-quadrate arch 

 described by the speaker, and makes the interesting observation 

 that it is formed of three elements, the median connecting the 

 parietal with the opisthotic. This piece, he says, is " apparently 

 the squamosal ;" as the latter bone completes the zygomatic arch, 

 it cannot occup}'' a position in the parieto- squamosal, unless it 

 sends a branch in that direction. 



Fifthl3\ He discovers the malar arch, proving it to be incom- 

 plete and supported by the postfrontal bone. Prof Marsh also 

 observes an ossification in the glenoid cavity of the opisthotic, 

 which he regards as the pterotic (of " Huxle}-," which should be 



' Trans. Amer. Philos. Soc, 18G9, p. 180. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 141 



Parker), an identification which cannot probably be maintained. 

 The connections of the pterotic, where present, are very different. 

 The bone in question is present in Edesfosaio'us tortor^ Cope. 



Sixthly. Prof. Marsh completes almost entirely onr knowledge 

 of the anterior limbs. The previous descriptions of these mem- 

 bers in CUdastes jji'opi/thon^ Cope, Holcodux ictericus, Cope, 

 and other species, had left the number of phalanges and their 

 relative positions, as well as those of the carpals, uncertain ; these 

 points are now happil}' supplied b}' Prof. Marsh's important re- 

 searches. 



Seventhly. He has done much for the pelvic arch and hind 

 limbs. lie was the first to announce the existence of both, and 

 actualh' described the pelvis o^ Edesfosauriis di.<j)ar; the speaker, 

 however, first described the hind limb in Liodon crassartus and 

 L. dyspelor^ Cope. Prof. Marsh is in error when he saj's the 

 "absence of these extremities in the Pythonomorpha was consid- 

 ered satisfactoril}' established." I had never stated that they 

 were certainl}'' absent, and the last time I wrote observed that this 

 order " possessed an anterior pair onl}', or with the posterior pair 

 so reduced as to have been insignificant.'" They appear, ac- 

 cording to Marsh, to have been relativel}' small in some of the genera. 

 In Liodon dyxpelor^ Cope, tlie anterior are the smaller. Prof. 

 Marsh la3's students under especial obligation for his determina- 

 tions of the pelvic elements and the excellent figures of all the 

 parts connected with the support of the hind limb. His figure of 

 the fore limb is also highlv important, as it will be difficult soon 

 to duplicate his beautifully complete specimen. 



In subsequent pages there are six additional species described, 

 bringing up the number from the Kansas Cretaceous to twenty- 

 three. Two new genera are proposed, viz., Lesfosaurus for those 

 l)reviously referred by myself to Holcodiis, Gibbes, and Bhino- 

 sai(i-u^ for species allied or belonging to Liodon. As to the for- 

 mer, it is no doubt a well-marked genus, and I am willing to 

 believe Prof. Marsh's opinion, that it will not include (libbes' Hol- 

 codxts acufiden.v, will turn out to be well founded ; but there is, 

 on tlie other hand, insufficient evidence to show that it is not 

 Flati'carpxii<^ Cope. If Liodon curliroslris be referred to it, it 

 will ver}' probably' prove to be Flofccarpui^^ as tiiat species pre- 

 sents palatine teeth, much as in P. fympaniticuf^, and the i)leuro- 

 dont character is not wanting in some of the other species. Uhi- 

 7}osain-Uf< includes such species as Liodon prori(/rr, Cope. As 

 the name has been used two or three times before, it may be al- 

 tered to PIiavi2>ho)<niiriii>, but I have always had doubts that the 

 conic projecting snout would distinguish the species gcnericall^' 

 from the true Liodon, with which it agrees in dentition. Tlic 

 type of Liodon, L. anceps ord., is, however, very little known.

Ecmarks on Mastodon from Neiu 3Iexico. — Prof. Leidy directed 

 attention to portions of a lower jaw of Mastodon reeentl,y received 

 for examination from the Smitlisonian Institution. The speci- 

 mens were from New Mexico, and were presented to the latter by 

 the Hon. W. F.M. Arn}'. One of the specimens contains a molar 

 resembling that from California, described before the Academy, 

 and supposed to belong to Mastodon obscu?-us, which was origin- 

 ally named from a tooth said to have been derived from the mio- 

 cene formation of Mar^'land. The other fragment is part of the 

 S3'mphysial prolongation of the jaw containing portions of tasks. 

 This resembles in its form and proportions the corresponding part 

 of the European Mastodon angustidens. These and other speci- 

 mens, including the portion of an upper tusk, having a band of 

 enamel, from California, described before the Academy' under the 

 name of 3Iastodon Sheppardi, lead to the inference, that a species 

 resembling Mastodon angustidens, inhabited North America during 

 the middle tertiary period. The late Dr. Falconer states that he 

 saw at Genoa the cast of a lower jaw of a Mastodon from Mexico, 

 with an enormous beak containing a large lower incisor. The 

 animal to Avhich it belonged was named Ithy nchotheriuni. This 

 perhaps ma}'^ be the same as the species named 3Iostodon obsciirus. 

 A full description of the New Mexican and Californian fossils, 

 with plates, will shortly be given.

 BY J. G. COOPER, M.D, 

 ALEXIA SETIFER. Cp. n. s. PI. 3, fig. A. 1 to fi. 



Sp. cn. Alexia " ^. myosotis''' persimilis, sed testa jimiore tetis bre- 

 vissimis deciduis munita, linea spirali ante sutura sitis. Var. tenuis, 

 cloiigata, pallida. 



Lat. 0.08 ad 0.14, alt. 0.30 ad 0.40 partes cent, pollici. 



Shell very similar to A. viyosotis (of the northern Atlantic 

 States), but the 3'oung provided with short deciduous bristles, 

 arranged in a spiral line just in front of the suture. 



Form varying from ovate to lanceolate, translucent, smooth, 

 pale to dark corneous, with a purple tinge, often marked with nu- 

 merous longitudinal paler stripes ; apex short, or rather length- 

 ened and subacute ; suture usually distinct, whorls six or seven, 

 the nuclear three or four, ver}' narrow, and nearl}^ alike, with the 

 apex inverted or planorvoid ; the last elliptic-ovate, and forming 

 nearly three-fourths of the total lengtli ; aperture nearly' two- 

 thirds of total length ; peristome thickened and projecting hori- 

 zontall^', especially in front, appressed to columella, leaving a 

 slight umbilical fissure open, then blending with a strong plait 

 which winds obliquely inward ; parietal wall with a white trans- 

 verse flat denticle near its middle, and usually a small tubercle 

 above it, making the moutli three-toothed on the inner side. 



Young shell showing the bristles on about three wliorls, the 

 first two or three being without them, and losing them by wearing 

 off after attaining half its growth. 



The variety /criKi.s is slender, elongated, shell usuall}- thinner 

 and paler, sometimes amber-yellow. Man}' of the more robust 

 form arc, however, fully as thin and pale. 



Animal yellowisli-white, translucent ; eyes black; tentacles trans- 

 parent, faintly wrinkled, muzzle strongly wrinkled transversely. 



This species seems chieflj' characterized by the bristles of the 

 young shell, but these may exist in some other species, being easily- 

 overlooked, or rubbed olf in cleaning tlie shell, which is ollen 

 covered with adhesive mud. 



The usual form of the adult differs much from tlie figure given 

 by Binney of "yJ. mijosotiis,^^ more resembling other Kuropcan 




144 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



species. The variety tenuis, however, is very similar to that of 

 Binuey and Trj^on. The figures show the varieties of form aucl 

 color met with here, but scarcely two specimens are exactly alike, 

 and some adult shells are as ventricose as the j'oung one figured. 



I found this species exceedingly numerous on the stony shore 

 of a tide-water creek within the limits of San Francisco, but only 

 for a distance of about ten rods, where a rocky point comes to the 

 shore, though a few can be found for half a mile on loose stones 

 and timbers, crawling under the stones in great numbers when 

 the tide is out long. They look so similar to the buds of the 

 Salicornia which grows about the spot that thej'- may easily be 

 overlooked hy enemies when crawling among it. They creep 

 rather rapidly by a stead}' gliding motion, like the other pulmo- 

 nates, and live for a week or more in a damp vial, though killed 

 quickly by immersion in fresh water. 



Though so numerous that several hundred may be scraped off 

 from the bottom of a small stone, it is strange that this shell has 

 escaped the notice of a host of collectors for more than twenty 

 3'ears, though many of them must have passed within a few yards 

 of the spot, as it is close to the old southern entrance to the city 

 by land. This suggests that it ma}' have been introduced from 

 China on the bottoms of fishing-boats, or as ova in damp nets or 

 otherwise, especially as the Chinese have always made the creek 

 a fishing station, and cultivate the low land along its shores. It 

 is, however, just as likely to be native, and to have been over- 

 looked on account of the limited and rather inaccessible locality 

 it inhabits. Until it is proved that these delicate aquatic mol- 

 lusca can be transported from one country to another by the ways 

 of commerce, it is better to consider them indigenous. I may be 

 able to find them in other similar localities out of the way of 

 foreign vessels. 



It is almost as probable that the Assiviinea, which is equally 

 numerous in the same spot, was introduced in the same way, though 

 that is probably the same as found in other similar creeks about 

 the bay.^ 



I Ifoie on "^. myosotis''' of U. 8. Atlantic Coast. The variations of the 

 Pacific sliell suggest that the form figured by Biuney is only the northern 

 attenuated form of what may occur farther south more fully developed as

 found in New Jersey. Conrad's and De Kay's descriptions of "JoreaZjs"

I Avill probably be able to make explorations sufficient to deter- 

 miue most of these doubtful points relating to this and many 

 other species, before the publication of the Conchology of Cali- 

 fornia bj' the Geological Survey.

Long, circa duo polliceo, alt. corporis bis major quam lat. disci motivi. 

 Testa oblongo-ovalis, i poll. 



Similar to L. Sowerhii (of England), the back being stronglj' 

 carinate even when fully extended, and higher than the front of 

 body ; shield granulate-rugose, and with a groove, sub-elliptic in 

 outline, above the level of the spiracle, which is just behind the 

 middle ; color blackish-brown, or deep black above, the sides paler, 

 the locomotive disk beneath whitish. 



Length about two inches or less, height of body twice the width 

 of foot. Shell oblong-oval, i inch long. Its other characters 

 agree with those common to most of the subgenera Anialia and 

 Eulimax. The figures best show the comparative points. 



I have named this species in compliment to Dr. George Hew- 

 ston, of this cit}', who has made manj' interesting observations on 

 the habits of the species in his garden. 



It is, I believe, the first "yl?»a/m" found in the United States, 

 nativp or naturalized. In the remarkable groove on the shield it 

 differs from any I find described, but, as this is not apparently 

 connected with any organic difference, it seems merely a specific 



indicate varieties like ours but not described by Biuuey, while Say's " tur- 

 ritus'" is like the young. 



Binncy's figure of the animal of " Tralia,^' from Charleston, is so much 

 like ours, that it seems probable tliat it may also be a more southern develop- 

 ment of the Alexia, while his " T. puatlla,^' from Florida, looks very like 

 some forms of our A. setifer, the revolving lines and labial denticles being, 

 perhaps, more perfect characteristics not found far uortli. Melampus bidcn- 

 tattis presents similar variations with a like geograi)hieal range. Eastern 

 conchologists may decide whether it is not more Hkely that the soiUheru 

 shell extends north under a less perfect form, than that the northern shell 

 has come from Europe, and also wliieh ofthf nanus (|iinti'd is i)rior, if it is 

 distinguished from the latter.

character. It does not evea coincide Tvith the outline of the at- 

 tached portion, or with the shell, and, though general, is in some 

 so faint as to be scarcely visible. 



The L. fuliginosus, Gld., seems very similar, and might pass 

 for the same, though described as from " New Zealand," but has 

 ferruginous tentacles. 



It is barely possible that this species was inti'oduced from China 

 or elsewhere, as I have not met with it beyond the vicinit}' of San 

 Francisco, but it is so exceedingly numerous in ever}'- garden here 

 that it seems indigenous. It is found in drier places than our 

 others, and is active all summer in moist shady places. I find 

 none like it described from Asia or Europe.

This, the only indigenous eastern species, has not been before 

 announced from west of the Kocky Mountains, and I, therefore, 

 give a figure of the California form which appears rather more 

 robust than the eastern. It presents the same range of colors, 

 from amber-brown to black, being paler when it first emerges from 

 its retreat in the dry season. I have found it numerous at San 

 Francisco and Santa Cruz, at Clear Lake, Alta, 3625 ft. elev. on 

 west slope of the Sierra Xevada, and Truckee, 5866 ft. high on the 

 east slope, besides observing probably the same at points near 

 lats. 31° and 39° in the valleys. It has not been noticed in 

 Oregon.

Resembling A. Columbiamis in form and color, but with the 

 dorsal grooves much more numerous (26 to 36), often twice as

The figui'es given of portions of this form, taken from life, show 

 the remarkable dissimilai'ity in the reticulations of the dorsal 

 region, and, did I not find considerable variation among them, I 

 would consider it certainly a different species. 



The black form next mentioned agrees with the Oregon animal 

 in this character as shown in E. Young and adult of the yellow 

 form, from one to six inches long, all show the same peculiarity,

and it ma}' be only an adaptation to a drier climate. It is quite 

 well shown even in alcoholic specimens, and I am surprised that 

 it has not before been mentioned. Some parts of ^Ir. W. G. Bin- 

 ney's description may, however, be taken from tliis variety. Tlie 

 following notes have not before been published, and are all talieu 

 from the southern form. Mr. Toy has brought it from the Sierra 

 Nevada, lat. 39°, alt. about 3500 feet, but I have not heard of it 

 elsewhere out of the coast range. 



The locomotive disk, anal and generative oriflces are like those 

 of Limax. Fig. D, 3, shows the latter as preserved in alcohol in 

 a specimen taken in copido. I may be able to describe them more 

 full\' from fresh ones. The mantle is minutely granulated, Avhich 

 ma}- have led Mr. Tryon to place it in Amaha. The dorsal- 

 grooves are unicolor witli the rest of body, but those of the upper 

 margin of foot are colored brown (sometimes very pale), the color 

 permanent in alcohol, and t'.ic stripes wider at every fourtli or 

 fifth, like the grooves. The longitudinal division of the foot be- 

 neath is ver}' fainth' perceptible. 



The young, just hatched, is pale-j^ellowish, with pellucid whitish 

 spots, and when an inch and a half long is colored like adult, 

 while the shell is perceptible through the thin shield. Tiiis can 

 also be seen by looking into the grisacle of the adult when full}- 

 expanded. 



Eggs are laid from April 1st to June, and var}^ in size from 0.44 

 X 0.36 to 0.35 X 0.2G inch, (probably laid by slugs of various 

 ages). They have a shelly but tough envelope, and, after the}' are 

 laid, the shell is often entirely xoanting in the animal, having ap- 

 parently been absorbed to form the egg-shells ! This may explain 

 the absence or fragmentary state of the shell in some species re- 

 ferred to Arion.

Dr. Gonld mentions a, "small specimen uniformly slate color" 

 (probably from alcohol), which indicates that this is also found in 

 Oregon. A very young one from east of S. F. Bay has the shield 

 and back brownish with small irregular black spots, and no cari- 

 nation perceptible as it is in the yellow species, which shows it 

 stronger in the young than the adult. The dorsal grooves agree- 

 ing with those of the Oregon form suggested that it was only a 

 southern dwarfed A'ariety of that, which is often mottled with 

 blackish ; but Dr. Gould's specimen was also small, and may in- 

 deed have been collected in California. Here I find none inter- 

 mediate between this and the yellow variety. The color and dorsal 

 grooves agreeing with Liniax Hewstoni also suggested hybridity, 

 but I have never found this in the same localities with that species. 

 We thus have three very distinct sijecies often equally black, but 

 the only common cause I can guess for this similarity is possibly 

 more nocturnal habits than in the others. The comparative 

 rarity of this form ma}^ be a consequence of more thorough con- 

 cealment in the daytime. I found them copulating in December, 

 and the 3'oung was found in Februar^^ probably recently hatched.

 each side above the spiracle, converging in an ellii)tic form ; a pale 

 dorsal streak. Head uniform pale-brown, tentacles darker. Foot 

 and often the mantle tinged with olive. 



Shell large and thick, the nucleus near posterior left corner ob- 

 tusely rhomboidal, concave beneath. Length about 0.14, breadth 

 0.06 inch.^ Jaw arcuate, wider near middle, with 20 to 30 riblets 

 denticulating the lower margin. 



Hah. Near south and east sides of San Francisco Bay north- 

 ward to Santa Cruz. It is confined to well wooded hills or damp 

 river-banks, being less able to bear heat and dryness than our 

 other slugs. I have named it for Dr. C. L. Anderson of the latter 

 place, a zealous naturalist, who has much aided me by collecting 

 this and other species of mollusca. 



This species combines the form and spiracle of Arion with the 

 shell and jaw of ^WoZimaa;, making the generic distinctness of the 

 two forms doubtful, and consequently connecting J n'o« still more 

 closely with Limax. The minute caudal mucous gland and acute 

 tail of this species also approach the character of Limax, and 

 make the modern separation of these genera into separate families 

 still more unnatural. 



The rule adopted by Agassiz of founding family divisions on 

 modifications of the general forms, and genera only on those of 

 special organs, will apply well in the case of these animals. But 

 a difl!iculty arises here in the disagreement of this species in several 

 points from the latest definition of the genus Arion, in those cha- 

 racters above indicated as connecting it with Ariolimax. Still, as 

 Arion is the older genus, it would seem more proper to extend its 

 generic limits to include a more developed shell and jaw than 

 usual, than to make Ariolimax include a species as different from 

 the type in form, position of siiiraclc, and structure of locomotive 

 disk. The form of the caudal termination seems like that of 

 Arion liorlensis. Orifice of generative organs about half-wa}- be- 

 tween tentacle and shield as in Limax, etc. 



In colors, this species is so similar to ''^ A. foliolaliis,^^ Gld., that 



' The shrll represented in the ligurcs is from a larger specimcu than the 

 animal figure. 




150 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



it mio-ht be considered identical if not for the important differ- 

 ences indicated in the diagnosis. 



Mr. Binney places that species without hesitation in subgenus 

 Lochea, which has the shell represented by calcareous granules 

 only, but remarks that he had not examined the jaw or granules, 

 and, as the types are probably still preserved in the Smithsonian 

 Institution, this important omission may yet be attended to. 



Dr. Gould says, in Binney's Terr. Moll. ii. p. 31, " That this 

 animal belongs to the genus Avion there can be little doubt, from 

 the peculiar strncture of the tail, as represented in Mr. Drayton's 

 figure, and from the anterior position of the respiratory orifice." 

 He did not examine any specimens with reference to the shell, but 

 figures the dorsal areola? as peculiarly granulated and indented, an 

 appearance apparently caused, as in our species, when in alcohol, 

 by minute reticular subdivisions. The figure represents tlie tail 

 as acute, though Dr. Gould describes it as " somewhat truncated 

 at tips exhibiting a conspicuous pit which was probably occupied 

 by a mucous gland." As he was not aware of the existence of 

 this gland in his " Limax^'' Columbianus, he may have examined 

 specimens of the latter when partly or wholl}^ destitute of the 

 shell (as described by me), and confounded them with Drayton's 

 figure, as alcoholic specimens do not retain all the specific charac- 

 ters. The great similarity of the figure published as of the Arion 

 to that of L. Columbianus makes it probable that some such con- 

 fusion has occurred, the only essential difference being the posi- 

 tion of the spiracle. 



Mr. Tryon places this species in Ariolimax^ but on what grounds 

 is not stated. This would be justified by the discovery of the 

 shell and generative orifice in alcoholic specimens, but is rendered 

 doubtful b}" other considerations above pointed out. 



Mr. Drayton's original figure probably represented A. Ander- 

 sonii^ though Dr. Gould's description does not agree wholly 

 with it.

Shell depressed-turbinate, below a little concave, whorls G^ to 7, 

 umbilicus large, peristome white, expanded, somewhat thickened, 

 above descending; color yellowish-brown, paler beneath, with a 

 dark-brown zone above the peripheiy, margined below by j-ellow- 

 ish, visible on three whorls; epidermis shining, finelj- nigose- 

 malleate, lines of growth often obliquely cut by delicate grooves, 

 obscure revolving ridges around umbilical region. Young shell 

 not subangled. 



Animal pale purplish-gray, semicylindrical, its length twice the 

 breadth of shell, its whole surface covered with small elliptic 

 tubercles ; ej'c-bearing tentacles one-third the length of body ; foot 

 short behind, wedge-shaped, broader than height of bod}', its 

 margin crcnately incised. Intestines seen through upper whorls. 

 llah. "Cedar Mountain," 25 miles southeast of Mount Diablo, 

 California, among oaks and cypresses, thence south to San Luis 

 Obispo, 200 miles. 



The first specimen obtained by Prof. Brewer, "east of Mount 

 Diablo," was too imperfect for me to decide on its characteristics, 

 and the sculpture, somewhat resembling that of the Arionta group, 

 led me to refer it doubtfully to that, while the form and color sug- 

 gested hybridity between A. ramentosa and the nearest of the 

 /yysj;»oe groups, either L.mormonum or ^7'as^7■^■, neither of which 

 were known, however, to exist within 90 miles of ramentosa. 

 Fresh specimens, lately discovered b}' the industrious Dr. Yates, 

 among the cypresses of Cedar Mountain, though much smaller,

indicate its near alliance with L. TrasHi, differing as much, how- 

 ever, as several others of the allied species. 



Specimens said to come from San Luis Obispo appear to be the 

 same, and are the ones referred to by me in the Cal. Acad. Proc. 

 III. 332, as combining characters of ra??ie?itosa and Dupetithouarsi. 

 I am, however, becoming more and more of the opinion that 

 natural hybrids are so very scarce that shells presenting interme- 

 diate characters are to be considered rather varieties in which 

 local proximity and exposure to the same influences produce 

 changes simulating those of neighboring geographical groups, as 

 before remarked, concerning some of our most northern and 

 southern forms. Thus we have in this the nearest approach to the 

 sculpture of the Ariontas to be found in our Lysinoes, as it exists 

 on a belt next adjoining the centre of development of the sculp- 

 tured group. L. Dupetilhouarai often shows a little of the same 

 sculpture. 



This form probably occupies the whole of the gap of 160 miles 

 south of Mount Diablo, mentioned previously by me as destitute 

 of any known species, but at an elevation seldom visited by col- 

 lectors, though the young specimens, also found by Dr. Yates, " at 

 the crossing of the Salinas River above Soledad," indicate that it, 

 like others, may follow down the river banks into the valleys. 

 These have a smaller umbilicus and flatter apex. About two hup- 

 dred miles southward, the Mount Diablo range combines with the- 

 coast range near San Luis Obispo, the Salinas Yalley lying be- 

 tween them. 



Genus ASSIMINEA, .Leach. 



Although not a pulmonate mollusc, the species to be described 

 forms a link between these and the branchiate shells, in its power 

 of existing for several days, and even of crawling actively about 

 in a slightly damp bottle, showing nearly as much vitality out of 

 water as the Alexia with which it lives, while it cannot exist in 

 fresh water. It is probable that, like An^ndlaria, etc., it possesses 

 a reservoir for moistening its gills, or a sort of imperfect lung. 

 Its subterminal tentacular eyes are also similar to those of the 

 Pujnllse, with only one pair of tentacles. 



It will be lucky if some hair-splitting microscopist, ambitious 

 of affixing his name to the species of others, does not find a slight 

 difference in the lingual asperities on which to found a "new

 rufous patch on top of head. "When extended it is about tAvice as 

 long as shell, the foot ovate. 



Inhabits brackish creeks near mouth of San Francisco Bay, and 

 found in great numbers within the city limits under small stones 

 with Alexia. The animal crawls activel}' by a jerking motion, 

 ftlternatelj^ projecting the foot in front of the muzzle and then 

 drawing the shell forwarti, so as to show the two positions repre- 

 sented in the plate. 



The shell closely resembles Ihjdrohia Californica., which is found 

 in similar places at Oakland and ^Martinez, but, it being rather 

 scarce there, I have not been able to obtain living specimens yet 

 for comparison. Mr. Trj-ou's description and the dimensions 

 given agree exactly-, but Oakland specimens of the shell are thicker, 

 the whorls a little shouldered, and the umbilical region pitted, 

 perhai)s from stronger growth. Mr. Tryon's figure, however, does 

 not agree with the dimensions. 



It dilfersfrom A.l aithrotundata., Carpenter, of the Str. of Fuca, 

 in all its dimensions and iu size. (See Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist., 

 18Go, p. 28.) Several of our frcsh-wato' Hydrobrinsc have been 

 confounded with //. Californira. 



I believe this is the first of the genus determined to inhabit tlu;

 the New England ^^ Bissoids^^ are congeneric.^ 



I have used the specific name Galifornica as not likely to lead

 Hydrohid^ and thus of another family.

July 2. 



The President, Dr. Ruschenberqer, in the chair. 



Sixteen members present. 



On a new Genus of Extinct Turtles. — Prof. Leidy stated that 

 in a more careful study of the fossil turtles of Wyoming, he had 

 determined that the one he had named Bsena undata belonged to 

 a different genus. Besides other well marked distinctive charac- 

 ters, like the genus Platemys, it possessed an additional pair of 

 plates to the usual number found in the sternum of the emydoids. 

 These plates are intercalated between the hyo- and hyposternals. 

 In Platemys Bullockii they are quadrate. In the new genus they 

 are triangular, and the sutures defining them cross the plastron 

 like a prostrated letter X, from which character it was proposed 

 to name the genus Chisternon. 



On some remains of Cretaceous Fishes. — Prof. Leidy called 

 attention to some teeth of fishes from the cretaceous formation, 

 which he described as follows : — 



Otodus divaricatus. 



The species is indicated by an entire tooth of peculiar character, 

 submitted to my examination by Dr. William Spillman, of Colum- 

 bus, Mississippi. It was sent to him from Texas, but its exact 

 localit}^ is unknown. It was probably derived from a cretaceous 

 formation. Of known species it resembles most the Otodus senii- 

 plicatus., Miinster, of the chalk of Europe, and has likewise consider- 

 able likeness to a tooth from the chalk of France, represented in 

 fig. ii. pi. Y6, of Gervais' Paleontologie Francaise. 



The crown forms an elongated demicone with the apex slightly 

 bent forward. The enamel at the base is plicated in front and 

 behind. The lateral denticles are conical and divergent outward 

 and anteriorly. The root is thick, strong and notched, and rises 

 posteriori}^ above the middle of the length of the tooth. Length 

 of crown in front 13 lines ; base of same external to denticles of the 

 same width. Breadth of root 15^ lines ; thickness 6 lines. 



OXYRHINA EXTENTA. 



A species founded on a number of teeth obtained from the 

 cretaceous formation of Kansas, by Dr. George M. Sternberg, 

 TJ. S. A., and from near Columbus, Mississippi, by Dr. William 

 Spillman. 



The teeth resemble most those of Oxyrhina Mantelli of the 

 English chalk, and differ mainlj' in the proportionately greater 

 lateral extension of the base of the crown.

ACRODTJS HUMILIS. 



Founded on a tooth adherent to a portion of limestone from 

 the Xew Jersc}' cretaceous formation. It resembles most nearly' 

 the Ac7'odus rugosus, Ag., of the chalk of Maestrieht, and the A. 

 polydictyos, Reuss, of the Bohemian chalk. The tooth is 8 lines 

 wide, 2| lines fore and aft. The anterior and posterior borders are 

 not quite straight ; and the extremities are angular. The upper 

 surface is moderatel}' convex. A nearly obsolete ridge crosses the 

 tooth transversely, and from this ridge minute folds are directed 

 forward and backward to end in a reticulation. 



This is I believe the first time the genus Acrodus has been 

 noticed in the American cretaceous formation. Prof Emmons 

 represents the tooth of a species in his report of the North Caro- 

 lina Geological Survey, p. 244, fig. 97, which he attributes to the 

 miocene. If reall}- an Acrodus tooth, it would be the latest spe- 

 cies yet discovered. It might be named Acrodus Emmonsi in 

 honor of its discoverer. 



Pycnodus faba. 



This species is named from a specimen from the cretaceous for- 

 mation of Mississippi, discovered by Dr. William Spillmau. The 

 fossil consists of a jaw fragment with four large teeth obliquely 

 parallel with each other. > They are elongated elliptical, and 

 smooth ; and the}' measure three-fourths of an inch wide, and one- 

 fourth of an inch in the sliort diameter. On both sides the larger 

 teeth, there are two rows of small teeth. 



Mr. XoRRis spoke at some length on his effort now in progress 

 to stock the Delaware with the true salmon ( Sal inn anlnr). Having 

 procured 12,000 ova from Mr. AVilmot, New Ca.stle, Canada, he 

 placed then on gravel in wooden troughs of running spring water 

 near the town of Easton, I'a. These eggs was taken in November, 

 ls71,by manipulation of tlie parent fish and feeundated in the 

 usual way, and placed in water almost down to the fret-zing point. 

 The young fish were, however, plainly visible in the egg when 

 received on the first of April, ami struggling to break the shell. 




164 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



On being placed in water at 52° the ova immediately commenced 

 hatching, and in a week the fry were all ont. In seven weeks the 

 yolk sac was absorbed, and they commenced feeding off small 

 particles of curdled milk fed to them daily for a week longer. 

 They were then transported in large tin vessels to the Buskill, 

 which runs through the outskirts of Easton, where a third of 

 them were liberated at the mouth of a cold spring branch, and the 

 remaining two-thirds placed in a small natural pond fed b}^ a 

 copious spring in a meadow above and discharging b}'^ a narrow 

 outlet into the creek. Either here or at the mouth of the spring 

 branch mentioned the fry will get such natural food as their in- 

 stinct will lead them to seek, and thrive far better than if kept in 

 artificial ponds and fed on prepared food. 



The law of the salmon, as with the shad and other anadromous 

 fishes, is that it will inevitably seek its native stream in its return 

 from sea impelled by the instinct of reproduction, and althougli 

 the Delaware is south of the limit of the geographical range of the 

 salmon, it is on the law of nature that reliance is placed for its 

 return to this river. It has been ascertained beyond doubt that 

 one-half of a brood of salmon go to sea when a little over a year 

 old, and the remaining half the following summer. The males of 

 salmon as with shad are fecund a year earlier than, the females, and 

 it is not improbable therefore that those that migrate when a year 

 old are males, and those that go to sea the next year are females. 

 Mr. Norris thought the Delaware, on account of its being unob- 

 structed by impassable dams and having a bold current, was a 

 favorable river for trying to acclimatize salmon south of their 

 present habitat. He is sanguine of success, and, even if the solu- 

 tion of this problem should not be favorable, he considers it im- 

 portant that the question should be definitely settled. 



Mr. Norris also made some remarks on the effect of food on the 

 external appearance of trout {S. fontinalis), as well as on the 

 quality of their flesh — that, when fed in crowded artificial ponds 

 on prepared food, the vermilion spots disappear, and the flesh 

 deteriorates, but that the spots are restored, as well as the flavor of 

 the fish, when placed in large ponds where they can find natural 

 food. He also spoke of the malformation of young trout and 

 salmon on being hatched, the body being curved around the yolk- 

 sac, causing their death in a few weeks.

On Artemiafrom Salt Lake^ Utah. — Prof. Leidy directed atten- 

 tion to a bottle containing numerous specimens of a minute cms-

tacean from Salt Lake, Utah, caught on the 22d of June by Mr. 

 C. Carrington, a member of Prof. Ilaytlen's exploring party now 

 in the field. The}' >vere received from Prof Ilayden with the 

 remark " that Salt Lake has been supposed, like the Dead Sea, to 

 be devoid of life, but its saltest water contains the most of these 

 little creatures." 



The crustacean is the Arteviia saJiua which has long lieen 

 known in Europe, and has been previously found in other localities 

 of this countrj'. The animal has alwa^'s been viewed with especial 

 interest, in its order, from the fact that it lives and thrives best in 

 a concentrated solution of salt, which would destroy' most marine 

 animals. It has not, I believe, been noticed in the ocean, but is 

 found in salt lakes, and salt vats, in which by evaporation the 

 brine has become more concentrated than sea water. 



Artemia is furnished with eleven pairs of limbs, which serve 

 both for progression and respiration. The limbs are four jointed, 

 and the joints have leaf-like expansions fringed with long feather- 

 like bristles. The narrow abdomen or tail-like prolongation of 

 the body is six-jointed, and traversed by the intestine. The last 

 joint ends in a pair of processes furnished each with a bunch of 

 bristles like those of the limbs. The head exhibits a median, 

 quadrate, black e^'C-spot, and in addition is provided with a pair 

 of pedunculate, globular compound e3-es. A short narrow pair of 

 inarticulate antennre project in advance of the eyes. 



The head of the male is furnished with a pair of singular organs 

 for seizing the female. These claspers are large double-jointed 

 hooks. Li the female they are replaced b}' a pair of comparativel}' 

 small horn-like processes. The first abdominal segment bears the 

 ovarian sac in the female; and two cylindroid api)endages in the 

 male. 



The female of the Salt Lake Artemia ranges from 4 to Y lines in 

 length ; the male from 3 to 4 lines in length. The color is trans- 

 lucent-white and ochreous-yellow, with three black eye-spots, and 

 a longitudinal line varying in hue with the contents of the intes- 

 tine. The ovarian sac appears orange-colored from the eggs 

 within. 



The antennaj end in three or four minute seta\ and are consider- 

 ably longer in the male tlian the female. The first joint of the 

 claspers is provided on its inner side just below the middle with 

 a spheroidal knob. The last joint forms a rectangular hook, the 

 angle having an ell^pw-like prominence. AVhen the clasper is 

 thrown forward, the outer border of the hook is convex ; the 

 anterior border straight, slighll}', or deeply concave, and the inner 

 or posterior border is sigmoid. Tiie anlenna* are longer than in 

 the female, and longer than the first joint of the claspers ; and in 

 the female are longer than their homologues. The ovarian sac it> 

 inverted llask-shaped, and has a pair of lateral conieal or niam- 

 millary, finely tuberculated processes. The caudal sel:v are longer 

 than in the male, au<,l are eight to each process.

This clescription is taken from alcoholic specimens. They ex- 

 hibit considerable variation in size, and to some extent in detail. 



Prof. Yerrill has described what he views as two species of 

 Artemia distinct from the well-known A. sali7ia. One he names 

 A. gracilis fi-om near New Haven, Conn.; the other A. llonico from 

 Lake Mono, Cal. That from Salt Lake differs from either of them 

 as much as they do from A. salina, and with tlie same propriety 

 may be regarded as a distinct species. I am disposed to view 

 them all as varieties merely of A. salina.

 time to time he had observed speci 

 cretaceous formations which were idei 

 of Lamna elegans and L. cuspidafa of tertiary deposits except 

 that they were devoid of the lateral denticles. He had now in his 

 possession well-preserved specimens of such teeth, unabraded, but 

 exhibiting no trace of the existence of lateral denticles. There 

 were teeth of the L. elegans variety found with the skeleton of 

 Hadrosaurus Foulkii in New Jerse}", and others from the creta- 

 ceous of Mississippi and Kansas. There were also teeth of the 

 L. cuspidata. variet}" from the cretaceous of Kansas, and one in a 

 block of chalk from Sussex, England. The absence of the lateral 

 denticles in all the cretaceous specimens he thought could hardly 

 be accidental, and suspected that these teeth represented the ox])- 

 rhina ancestors, of the tertiary Lamna elegans and L. cusjjidata, 

 who lived during the cretaceous era.

ON SOME NEW SPECIES OP FOSSIL MAMMALIA FROM WYOMING. 



Fort Bridoer, Uikta Co., Wyoming, 

 July 24tli, 1872. 



I arrived at this place on the 15th inst. The country is the 

 most remarkable that I have ever seen. It is an immense basin, 

 the bed of an ancient lake, bounded on the south by tlie Uinta 

 Mountains, and extending far north to the Wind River .Mountains. 

 The deposits of the lake, of the tertiary period, are estimatt><l to 

 be about 8000 feet in tliickness. They present the appearance of 

 a succession of terraces or table-lands extending southerly from 

 Green River to the l)ase of the Uintas. The country for the most 

 part is treeless, and, except along the watercourses, nearly a 

 desert. The tertiary deposits consist of strata so little inclined 

 that the}' appear to be horizontal to the eye. The strata are 

 composed main)}' of clays, soft and crumbling or more or less 

 indurated, often mixed with sand. Friable sandstones and in- 

 durated marls, often with al)undance of fresh-water shells, also 

 frequentl}' occur. The lands are often isolated by broad plains or 

 narrower valleys. Tliese isolated lands are named buttes, and 

 resemble great earthworks or huge railway eml)ankinents. Fre- 

 quentl}- their eroded sides give them tiie ap[)oarance of a vast 

 asseml)lage of p]gyptian pyramids Hanking the plains above. 

 Such assemblages of earthworks, pyramids, mounds, piles of trun- 

 cated cones, «S:c., rising from a plain, constitute what are named, 

 in various i^arts of our great West, "bad lands" or "mauvaiscs 

 terres." 



As the buttes crumble away under the effect of tiic weather, the 

 fossils of their strata become exposed to view. 




168 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



On the nth, in company with Dr. J. Van A. Carter and Dr. 

 Josepli K. Corson, U.S.A., I made a trij) to tlie valley of Dry 

 Creek, forty miles from Fort Bridger. Here we encamped and 

 spent three da^'s in exploring the neighboring buttes for fossils. 

 In ascending the buttes bounding the valley I was astonished at 

 the appearance of the country extending from the horizon in the 

 north to the snow3^-peaked Uintas on the south. An utter desert, 

 a vast succession of treeless plains and buttes, with scarcely any 

 vegetation and no signs of animal life. Everj'thing parched, 

 abundance of river courses without water, the stones at my feet 

 baked in the soil. An overwhelming silence reigned undisturbed 

 even by the hum of an insect. Truly, I said, this is the wreck of 

 another world which was once luxuriant with vegetation and 

 teemed with animals. 



We were successful in finding many interesting fossils. The 

 most abundant vertebrate remains are those of turtles, the shells 

 of which are frequently met with in little heaps of fragments into 

 which they have been reduced after exposure from the wearing of 

 the buttes. Of mammalian remains the most abundant are those 

 of the tapir-like animal I named Palseosyops paludosus. We also 

 found a number of more characteristic specimens than I had before 

 seen of the larger species of Paleeosyopa major. Dr. Corson farther 

 discovered the remains of a small species which may be named 

 Pal^osyops humilis. An upper molar tooth of this animal mea- 

 sures three-fourths of an inch in diameter. We have likewise 

 found some additional remains of Hyrachyus agrariiis, and better 

 specimens than I before had of the larger Hyrachyus eximius. A 

 well-preserved last lower molar of this species measures an inch 

 fore and aft. 



We were fortunate in obtaining the remains of two of the largest 

 and most extraordinary mammals yet discovered in the Bridger 

 tertiary deposits. One of these was a tapiroid animal exceeding 

 in bulk of body and limb the living Rhinoceroses, though the head 

 appears to have been proportionallj^ small. Dr. Carter discovered 

 many fragments of a skeleton of the animal, including a whole 

 humerus, portions of jaws, and a much crushed and distorted 

 cranium. 



The upper molar teeth have the crown composed of a pair of 

 transverse lobes, with sloping sides and acute summits, separated 

 externally and united internally in a V-like manner. A thick 

 basal ridge bounds the crown in front and behind. A last upper 

 molar measures an inch and a half in the median line fore ailcl aft. 

 The molars in advance are smaller. 



The lower molars have a trilobed crown. The anterior lobe, 

 larger than the others, extends across the crown and rises in a 

 prominent peak internally. The acute summit is worn away 

 posteriori}'. The middle lobe extends about two-thirds across 

 the crown from the outer side, and is less prominent than the 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 1G9 



others. The Ixick lobe, seconrl in size, is thickest internally. The 

 fore aufl aft diameter of the last lower molar is equal to the cor- 

 responding upper tooth. 



The dei)th of the lower jaw at the last molar is three and a 

 quarter inches. 



The humerus is nearly- a foot and three-fourths in length and 

 seven and a half inches in breadth at the condyles. 



I propose to name the great pachyderm of the Uinta countr}', 



the UlNTATHERlUM ROBUSTUM. 



If not the most interesting, the most exciting incident of our 

 exploration of Drj' Creek buttes was Dr. Corson's discovery of the 

 upper canine teeth, apparently of the most formidable of Carnivores, 

 the enemy of the Uintatherium^ Palceosyops, and other peaceful 

 pachyderms. Tlie teeth resemble in their form those of tlie Sabre- 

 toothed Tiger. The more perfect specimen consists of nearly nine 

 inches of the enameled crown. In its perfect condition the tooth 

 measured upwards of a foot in length, so that it exceeded the 

 canines of the great Brazilian ]\[achairodus. The tooth is sabre- 

 like, curved, and compressed conical. Its most remarkalile cha- 

 racter consists in the lance-head-like form of the terminal three 

 inches. It is thickened at the axis, and impressed and expanded 

 towards the edges, so as to be actually broader in one portion 

 than immediately above. The antero-posterior diameter of the 

 crown near its base is two inches ; the thickness over an inch. 



These canine teeth terminating in lance-like points must have 

 proved most terrific instruments of slaughter. Their i)ossessor 

 was no doubt the scourge of Uinta, and may therefore be ai)pro- 

 priately named Uintamastix atrux. 



On favorable report of the committee, the following paper was 

 ordered to be printed : —

MATEKIAL FOE A MONOGRAPH OF THE SPHENISCIDiE. 

 BY DR. ELLIOTT COUES, U. S. ARMY. 



This paper is based chiefly upon the specimens contained in the 

 Philadelphia Academy and Smithsonian Institution, one portion 

 of it representing a descriptive catalogue thereof. The Academy's 

 collection is the largest and most nearly perfect in this country, 

 and has not heretofore been worked up; while that of the Smith- 

 sonian is particularly valuable because it contains the types of all 

 the species described as new by Mr. T. R. Peale, in 1848. With 

 this material is collated that in the Museum of the Boston Societj", 

 as recently elaborated by the custodian, Prof. Hyatt. Extensive 

 lists of synonyms have been prepared, representing, it is believed, 

 every name, generic or specific, that has been proposed for these 

 birds, with numerous additional references. Some anatomical 

 investigations have been made in an attempt to determine the 

 genera. An annotated list, in chronological order, of the prin- 

 cipal authorities upon the subject, from the Linuiean starting- 

 point to the present day, is likewise given. 



I. OX THE LITERATURE OF THE SUBJECT. 



1766. LiNN^us, %s<. iVa^. i. pp. 214, 219. Gives two species, 

 under different genera. One, Diomedea demersa, based on Wil- 

 loughbj^, 242, Edwards, 94 (black-footed penguin), Clusius, 101 

 (Anser magellanicus), and Brisson, vi. pp. 97, 99, pi. 9 (Sphe- 

 niscus^ noevius) is now the Sphenicus demersus auct. It is 

 quoted from the Cape of Good Hope. The other, Phaeton demer- 

 sus^ is based upon Edwards, 49 (red-footed penguin), and the 

 Catarractes^ of Brisson, vi. 102 ; it is the Eudijptes catarractes of 

 this paper. In strict interpretation, the species should be called 



' These names, Sphcniscus and Catarractes, conflict with no Linna?an 

 genera, and so far are tenable. Spheniscus holds ; but the other is ante- 

 dated by Catarractes of Moliring, and therefore falls, since Mobring's 

 name does not conflict with a Linnsean one. If the very strict rules that 

 some contend for should go in force among the penguins, I hardly know 

 what would become of our nomenclature of the group. The bouleversement 

 of the familiar names would certainly be complete.

1768. Pennant, Phil. Trans. Iviii. p. 91, pi. 5. Gives an "Ac- 

 count of the different species of the Birds called Penguins," and 

 among other things characterizes the smaller of the two species 

 of Aplenodi/(es, subsequent!}' called longi?-ostris by Scopoli, and 

 later named pennantii by Gra3\ 



1777. Scopoli. I have not the work at hand, but, as well as 

 I can gather from other sources, Sonnerat's penguins are named 

 as follows: Manchot de la Nouvelle Guinee, Sonn. Yoy. 180, pi. 

 113 = Aptenodytes longirostris, Scop, (a name that appears to hold 

 good, a.ntedat'm g 2^6 nnantii of Gray). Manchot papou, Sonn. 181, 

 pi. 115 = Aptenodytes papua, Scop. Manchot a collier de la Xou- 

 velle Guinee, Sonn. 181, pi. 114 = Aptenodytes platyrhyncha, Scop. 

 The last is Sphejiiscus de7nersus,x!i.i'. magellanicus; the others 

 are valid new species. 



1781. Forster, Comm. Soc. Beg. Sc. Gotiing. iii. 121. "Ilis- 

 toria Aptenodytaj generis avium orbi australi proprii." This 

 article stands facile princeps among the writings upon this 

 subject of the last century. It not only marks a great advance 

 upon previous knowledge of the family, but is more satisfac- 

 tory in every respect than anj^thing that followed for a long 

 period; in fact, it is the real beginning of the exact literature. 

 Placing all the species in the genus Aptenodytes, the author 

 divides them into the Gristatae, containing one species, and the 

 Alopjhse, with eight species. His crested species is chryaocome, 

 n. s. ; and I agree with Dr. Schlegel that this is not the same bird 

 as Forster's catarractes. However his figure may strike us, and 

 however we may interpret his language, Forster certainly meant 

 to indicate two different species; and accordingly we cannot rele- 

 gate chrysocome to catarractes, as Gray has done. Forster's 

 crestless species are: A. jmtachonica, n. s., the first recognizable 

 description of the species Gray subsecjuently called fori<leri; A. 

 papua, Scop.; A. antarctica, n. s.; A. magellanicus, n. s., but the 

 collared variety of demersus, and tiie same as the Manchot dii 

 Cap de lionne Esperance, Buff., PI. Eulum. 382; A. dcini'rsnx 

 (= Diomedea demersa, L.) ; A. catarractes {= P/iacfon demersua, 

 L.) ; A. torquata, n. s., but a variety of deniersus, the same as A. 

 platyrhyncha. Scop.; and A. minor, n. s. Thus, of Forster's nine 

 species, six are here named for the first time; seven ;ire valid; and 




1Y2 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



four are valid new species. Most of the species are also figured. 

 Forster does not give longit'oslris, ScoP. ; this, added to his seven 

 good species, gives us the following list of eight valid and well- 

 determined species, up to date.

 papua (pi. 17). Names Apt. gorfua; it is the same as Phaeton de- 

 mersus^ L. 



1788. Gmelin, Syst. Nat. i. pp. 555-9. This author gathers 

 eleven species, as follows. None of those given additional to 

 Forster's are valid: — 



1. A. chrysocome, p. 555. This is based primaril}^ upon Forster, 

 133, pi. 1, although the author also quotes the Manchot sauteur. 

 Buff, ix., 409, and Manchot huppe de Siberie, P. E. 984, which is 

 catarractes. But as the description is applicable to either species, 

 and the prior reference is to Forster, I do not see why Gmelin's 

 bird should not be considered the same as Forster's. 



2. A. PATACHONiCA, p. 556. This is compounded of equal parts 

 of the two species of Aj^tenodytes ; for neither Gmelin nor n.ny 

 of the earlier authors seem to have made the discrimination, 

 although we can, in certain cases, as those of Scopoli and Forster, 

 determine which species they had in view. Thus, Gmelin quotes 

 Forster, 137, pi. 2, and Mill. 111. pi. 20, both of which are true 

 pataclionica, Forst. (forsteri, Gra^^); and also quotes Buff., ix. 399; 

 P. E. 975 ; Sonnerat, Yoy. 179, pi. 113 ; Pennant, Phil. Trans. Iviii. 

 p. 91 ; Pennant. G. of B. 66, pi. 14 ; and Latham, Syu. vi. 563, No. 

 2 ; most of which, when not including both species, are unmis- 

 takably the smaller species {pennantii^ Gray). 



3. A. PAPUA, p. 556. Based on Sonnerat and Forster. 



4. A. ANTARCTICA, p. 557. Forster's species. 



5. A. MAGELLANicus, p. 557. Forster's species. Mill., pi. 34, 

 Lath., Syn. vi. 569, are also quoted. It is a variety of demersus.

 variet}', /3, on Brisson's naevius coupled witli the Jlanchot d bee 

 tronque of Buffon, ix. 411 ; P. E. 1005. 



7. A. CATARRACTES, p. 558, stauds on the same footing as the 

 Linncean Phaeton demersus. 



8. A. TORQUATUS, p. 558, is tlie same as Forstcr's bird; the 

 collared variety of demersus. Sonuerat, pi. 114, etc. 



9. A. MINOR, p. 558 = A. minor, Forst. 



10. A. CHiLENSis and 11, A. chiloensis, p. 559, are based on 

 Molina's descriptions of a young S. demersus in downy plumage, 

 and one of the same species in imperfect feathering. 



1790. Latham, Index Ornilhologicus, ii. 878 et seq. Tn this 

 work l)inoraial names are given to the species described under 

 English names in the General S>jnopsis, vol. vi. of the same 

 author. We may also conveniently consider, in this connection, 

 Latham's General History, yo\. x. p. 381 et seq., which brings the 

 subject, so far as thia author is concerned, down to 1824. As ex- 

 pressing the author's mature views, we take up the species as 

 given in the latter work, referring also to the earlier ones. There 

 are fifteen of them, as follows: — 



1. Cape pinguin, p. 381 ; Gen. Syn. vi. 506 ; Apt. demersus, Ind. 

 Orn. ii. 879. This is the original Linntean Diomedea demersa. 

 Latham makes a var. A. out of Brisson's ,S'. naeoius, and a var. B. 

 of the Pinguin d lunettes of I'ernet, Voy. ii. 17, pi. 7, f. 3. 

 Neitlier variety stands good. 



2. AfAGELLANic PiNGi;iN',p. 383 ; Syn. 569 ; Apt. magellanicus, 

 Ind. 880. This is the collared variety of demersus. 



3. Crested pinquin, p. 385; Syn. 561 ; A. chri/socomc, Ind. 878. 

 This is essentially tlie same as Forstcr's and Gmelin's chri/socome, 

 but Latham also makes some other quotations (as Pinguinaria 

 cristata, Shaw, Nat. Misc. pi. 437, and Phuicli. Knl. 9:^4), which 

 are prolmbly catarractes. 



4. Red-footed pinquin, p. 386 ; Syn. 572 ; Apt. catarractes, Ind. 

 881. The original Phaeton demersus of Linnanis. 



5. Little pinguin, p. 387, pi. clxxx = A. minor, Forst. 



6. NewHollandpinquin, p. 388. Indeterminable witli certainty; 

 no references are given, but the description points to a young S. 

 demersus. (''Bill black, upper mandible hooked near the tip, 

 under truncated, legs flesh-colored brown, webs black.'')

9. Antarctic pinguin, p. 389; Syn. 565; A. ayit arctic a, Ind.

10. Patagonian pinguin, p. 390 ; Syn. 563 ; A. jmtagonica, Ind. 

 878. Here, as in Gmelin's case, the quotations of both the species 

 of Aptenodytes are brought togetlier, Buffon, Sonnerat, Forster, 

 Miller, Shaw, Pennant, and others being indiscriminatel}^ cited. 



II. Collared pinguin, p. 391 ; Syn. 571 ; A. torquata^ Ind. 880. 

 Same as Forster's bird of that name; the collared variet^^ of S. 

 demersus. 



12. Hairy pinguin, p. 392. No citations. Indeterminable. 

 The bird is unquestionably the young of one of the well-known 

 species, probably Ajyteiiodytes longirosfris, to judge from the 

 dimensions assigned. 



13. Woolly pinguin, p. 392, pi. clxxxi. No citations. Appa- 

 rentlj' a "new species," like the hairy penguin, and evidently the 

 young of Aptenodytes longirostris. 



14. Three-toed PINGUIN, p. 393; Syn. Suppl. ii. 361 ; Apteno- 

 dytes molinde, Ind. 881. This is the same as Gmelin's bird, both 

 being based on Diomedea chilensis of Molina. It is S2:>^ie7iiscus 

 demersus. 



Latham's fifteenth species, the "Apterous Pinguin," is the Ap-

name will stand, if, as Mr. Gray liolds, chrysocome and catarractes 

 Forst, Gm. and Lath., are the same bird ; but I cannot agree 

 with him here. I think that these older authors had two species 

 in view, and that their chrysocome is what Gray here names 

 pachyrhyncha. 



1844. LiCHTENSTEiN, Edit. Fo7^ster''s Descr. Anim. In this re-

 palpehrata, from the Cape of Good Hope, is the original Linnsean 

 Biomedea demersa, whilst A. brasiUensis is a variety of the same 

 species, equivalent to the old torquata or marjellanicus of Forster. 



1844. Gray, Am. Mag. Nat. Hist. xiii. 315. The author care-

 other pennantii, which is antedated by longirostris of Scopoli.

 logists are aware, the Ornithology of the Wilkes's Expedition was 

 " officiallj"" cancelled by the United States Government, and the 

 edition was recalled as far as possible, on account of the unsatis- 

 factory manner in which the author of the work was considered to 

 have performed his task. But the attempted suppression proved 

 impossible ; the work is extant, and must be recognized. In his 

 treatment of the penguins, Mr. Peale shows his familiarity with 

 the birds themselves, but unfortunately some ignorance of orni- 

 thological literature. With a copy of his work before us, and 

 all his original specimens, now in the Smithsonian, we find that 

 he has discriminated the species with perfect accuracy; and he 

 gives man}' new and interesting biographical data. His short- 

 comings are solely in the matter of nomenclature. We are enabled 

 to make the following determinations : — 



A. MAGNiROSTRis, Peale, = Sph. demej-sus, var. magellanicus. 



"A. CHRYSOCOME, Gm.?" Peale,= Eudyptes catarractes. 



A. PLAViLARVATA, Peale,= Fygoscelis antipodes (H. and J.) 



A. LONGiCAUDATA, Peale, = Fygoscelis adelise (H. and J.) 



A. T^NIATA, Peale,= Apitenodytes piapua of Scopoli, but the 

 name must stand, since Scopoli's is geographically inapplicable. 

 Peale's other names are correct ; his patagonica is Forster's bird, 

 the true " emperor penguin."

1849. Gray, Genera of Birds, iii. Since the Sjyhemscul a , like 

 the Psittacidae, the Picidse and some others, form a remarkably 

 definite and somewhat isolated group of birds, it is particularly 

 su-rprising that such an accomplished ornithologist as Mr. Gvny 

 should here and elsewhere dismember the Alcidx for the purpose 

 of wedging the penguins bodil}' in between different genera of 

 auks. "We have alread}^ had occasion to speak of this as ''a great 

 bleinish" upon Mr. Gray's treatment of these two families, and 

 our former opinion is strengthened with the increase of our know- 

 ledge upon the subject. In the " Genera," Mr. Gray adopts three 

 genera for the Spheni.HCidas, giving good characters and fnilhful 

 illustrations. We believe the division to be a very close approxi- 

 mation to the natural order — in fact, we are not sure that these 

 three genera are not a more truthful expression of fact than the 

 four we are led to adopt in the present paper. Mr. Gray cata- 

 logues the species known at that date, but we do not think he is 

 in tliis matter nearly so successful as in his generic divisions. 

 (See 1871, Gray, below.) A beautiful colored plate (pi. ITG) illus- 

 trates Eudyptes pachyrhyncha, Gra3\ The article is one of the 

 few that the student can confidently consult to gain a clear gene- 

 ral idea of the subject. 



18oO-5G. IJoNAPARTE, ? I do not know where this author 



has treated of the penguins, and none of the authorities consulted 

 give any reference. According to quotations, he has instituted a 

 genus Eudyplila upon Apleiiodytes ??»«o7', Forst., and has renamed 

 the two species of Aptenodytes that Gra^' named ybrs/tfri and pen- 

 ymndi, calling thorn imperator and rex respectively. There is no 

 excuse whatever for this. 



1858. Cassi.v, U. S. Exploriivj Expedition, Birds. Uniting 

 Peale's field studies with an accurate deterniinaticm of the species, 

 Mr. Cassin's article on the i)cnguius is one of special importance. 

 After examination of tlie original specimens themselves, we find 

 Mr. Cassin's identifications correct throughout ; but, for .some 

 reason, Eudyplei^ calarractcs does not appear, altiiough several 

 specimens were brought home by the Expedition, as shown in the 

 body of this paper.

puts Abbot's chrysocome as a synonym of nigrivestis, Gould ; 

 but as this last is a sjmonym of chrysocome, Forst., the affair 

 seems to odd itself even. 



1860. SCLATER, P.Z. S. 382. In a catalogue of the Falkland 

 Islands' Avifauna, the author gives (p. 392) five species of pen-

 and ivagleri, Scl.). He is, we think, perfectly justified in cancelling 

 Scopoli's name '"'• papua''^ on the score of geographical inapplica- 

 bility, but in proposing to call the species after Wagler, has he 

 not overlooked Peale's prior designation ? (For additions and 

 corrections, cf. Id. ibid., 1861, 45.)

 species of the family being represented in the Leyden Museum, 

 this article is, in effect, a monograph of the Spheniscidse ; and it 

 is, in every respect, the most satisfactory treatise i;pon the subject 

 that has appeared, being as much superior to the contemporaneous 

 literature as Forster's was in its day and generation. As far as 

 the determination of the species is concerned, our own studies 

 bear out Dr. Schlegel's in every single instance ; indeed, it seems 

 to us impossible to reach any other conclusion, when any con- 

 siderable and sufficient amount of material is examined. The 

 present article of ours is so completely an indorsement of Dr. 

 Schlegel's, that the only points of difference are one or two unim- 

 portant synonymical determinations among the crested species, 

 which, after all, will probably remain matters of opinion. Dr. 

 Schlegel's analysis of the species is an excellent clue to their 

 determination. He presents five primary sections, the first repre- 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 179 



senting Ajitenodytes, the fourth and fifth containing, respectively, 

 S. minor, and S. demersus "with its variety magellmnciis. The 

 third contains the four crested species (divided into that one with 

 the short tail, cntarractes, and the three with longer tail, chryso- 

 covie, chrysolopha, and diademata) in one sub-group, to which 

 antipodes is added as a second sub-group. The second includes 

 the three longest-tailed species, adelise, jiapua, and antarctica. 

 The article is open to criticism on the score of the generic deter- 

 mination, we think, for we show, in another place, that there cer- 

 tainh' are several well-marked modifications of cranial structure, 

 warranting, if not enforcing, as man}' generic divisions. But 

 even here the difference between Dr. Schlegel's results and our 

 own is rather apparent than real, for the divisions he makes seem 

 to correspond, in the main, with the genera we find it necessarj' to 

 adopt. {Cf. Neicton, Zool. Rec. 1867, 124. Ibis, 1868, 110.) 



1867. Huxley, P. Z. 5., 458. The penguins form the fourth 

 of the several third-rate groups into which the author proposes 

 to divide birds, in his celebrated "Classification," and are called 

 ^^ Spheniscomorphse''' — a name anticipated by Squamipennes, 

 Nullipe.nnes, Impennes, Plilopteri, and some other designations. 

 Of the nine sets of characters assigned, the fifth, sixth, seventh, 

 and eighth are more or less perfectly diagnostic; the ninth is 

 shared by nearl}'^ all swimming and some wading birds; the fourth 

 and first are no more applicable to penguins than to a great many 

 other birds; the third is not likewise particularl}' pertinent, and 

 the second is untrue, so far as relates to the basipterygoid i)ro- 

 cesses — those being present in some species of the family. The 

 group, it is said, "contains" the single famil}' A]>fi'T()di/lid,T, and 

 comprises three genera, Eudijptcs, Sphenisciis. and Apterodytes 

 [lege Aptonodytes], It is probable that final determinations will 

 show that Prof. Huxley's views are perfectly sound in this last 

 particular. (V. cranial characters, infra.)

 men in the Philadelphia Academy represents the same thing. 



18tl. Gray, Hand-list^ iii. pp. 98, 99. Mr. Gray retains the 

 Spheniscidse in the unnatural association with the Alcidee that we 

 have already been forced to criticize adversely. The three genera 

 he adojats appear to be well founded, the author here showing the 

 same admirable conservatism that guides his recognition of full 

 genera throughout the work; but we think that some of the species 

 retained under subdivisions of his most extensive genus, Eudypte^^ 

 are more different from each other than they are from species of 

 the other genera; and iu this respect some change seems to be 

 desirable. But in the determination of the species Mr. Gra}' is 

 certainly wide of the mark; assuredly, there are not nineteen of 

 them, as he gives. The list is much more useful as a guide to 

 one's own research than as a model to be copied. At the same 

 time, the sj'uonymical discriminations are so accurately made that 

 little or no confusion results from the redundancy of species. 

 The only point concerning which we are at issue in the matter is 

 that Mr. Gray relegates chrysocome, Forst., to catar7'actes, leav- 

 ing his pachyrhyncha as the tenable name of a certain species, 

 whereas we agree with Dr. Schlegel, that chrysocome, Forst., is 

 different from cafarrades, and is the prior name of what Gray 

 calls pachyrhyncha. The following reductions in the list appear 

 to be required : — 



No. 10,806 to be united with Xo. 10,805. 



No. 10,804 to be united with No. 10,803.

 10,803, 10,805, 10,807, 10,808. 



1871. Hyatt, Proc. Bost. Soc. Nat. Hint. This is, we believe, 

 the author's first appearance as an ornithologist ; but he shows 

 the trained naturalist here as elsewhere, bringing to bear upon the 

 subject the same qualities that have distinguished him in another 

 department of zoologj'. There is a certain freshness and origi- 

 nality^ in his treatment of the family that contrast by no means 

 unfavorably with more conventional writings of practised ornitho- 

 logists, and, in looking from a new stand-point, he has caught 

 sight of some things that pei'sons accustomed to the birds have 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PIIILADELPniA. 181 



looked cit -witlioiit seeing. This more than compensates for some 

 slight deficiencies that, under the circumstances, we could not 

 reasonablj"^ expect to find supplied. The article modestly pro- 

 fesses to be simply a museum catalogue, but it possesses scien- 

 tific claims of a ver}' high order. The pterylographic data repre- 

 sent a valuable supplement to Xitzsch's earlier notice. So far 

 as we know, Prof. Hyatt is the first naturalist who has attempted 

 any critical discrimination of the various types of the Spheyiificidie 

 with a view of determining their precise relationship, and espe- 

 cialljr their genetic relations to each other and to a probable an- 

 cestral stock; and this, we need not add, is work upon a higher 

 plane than the mere identification of species, or preparation of 

 descriptions and syuonym^'. We must refer to the paper itself 

 for the details that we cannot here enter upon. It will suflice to 

 say here, in heartily indorsing the author's plan of stinly and 

 concurring in his general conclusions, that he shows bettor reasons 

 for the genera he adopts than any one has hitherto given, and that 

 our own studies of osteological structure, as far as these go, are 

 emphatic evidence in favor of his views.

 In this work, an alphabetical catalogue of the nominal species, 

 thirtj'-one in number, that were originally described under ''Ap- 

 tenod^'tcs," is given, with the reference of each to its i)roper 

 place. The determinations seem to be correct, with few excep- 

 tions. As the work has not progressed beyond the letter "A," 

 the remaining names are not accounted for. 



II. ON CEUTAIX POINTS OF CRANIAL STRUCTURE 

 REARING UPON THE DETERMINATION 0¥ THE 

 GENERA. 



Some authors have rested content with referring all the pengriins 

 to a single genus, adopting cither the name Apteiiudi/tcs or ^;>/»e- 

 niscus; and there is some show of reason for this, in the fact that 

 all the representative species arc singularly interrelated in various 

 points of form. Rut this is simply defining a genus upon the 

 identical grounds that indicate the family. Others, going to the 

 opposite extreme, have instituted or a<lopted a genus for every 

 leading species, though in so doing they have been of course un- 

 able to assign characters of more tiian specific value. To rocou- 




182 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



cile these conflicting views, and, if possible, to fix this question of 

 tlie genera with reasonable certitude, has been one object of the 

 present investigation. 1 found that any division of the species 

 according to the details of external form, as the size, shape, and 

 extent of feathering of the bill, length of tail, presence of peculiar 

 ptilosis, etc., would be, for the reason just alluded to, an elevation 

 of various chai'acters, properl3'- to be regarded as specific, to 

 generic rank ; while the ignoring of these would force me to the 

 other extreme of recognizing a single genus virtually equivalent 

 to the famil}'^' itself. It seemed to ine that, if there were true 

 genera among the penguins, the fact would appear from examina- 

 tion of internal structure ; and, having a number of skulls at com- 

 mand, I directed my attention to these. As far as my material 

 goes, the results of this investigation are to me highly satisfactory. 

 At the same time, having examined the skulls of only a limited 

 number of species, I cannot fix the generic status of all of them, 

 nor even say how far, if at all, the skulls of the species not ex- 

 amined may show intergradatiou between the types of structure 

 herewith detailed. 



The skulls examined show three positively different patterns. 



A. The first is that presented by Aptenodytes pennantii. The 

 rostrum is much longer than the rest of the skull, attenuate, 

 particularly narrow and acuminate. The nasal opening is cor- 

 respondingly' long and narrow. The upper prong of the nasal 

 bone is auchj^losed with the nasal prong of the premaxillary. The 

 palatines are auchylosed with the maxillse. The zygomata dip 

 downward moderately from the maxillo-jugal suture. The man- 

 dible is not abruptly deepened in any part of its length, and shows 

 a long narrow vacuity at the juncture of its symphyseal.with the 

 succeeding elements. The angle of the mandible lies directly 

 below a perpendicular let fall from the mastoid. The interorbital 

 space on the top of the skull is broad and smooth, since the rough 

 depressions for the lodgment of the glands are narrow, and ter- 

 minate before reaching the anteorbital prominences. The tem- 

 poral fossae are very shallow, widely apart, and merely separated 

 by a slight bony ridge from the slight depression between them- 

 selves and the cerebellar protuberance. The greatest width of the 

 skull is one-third, or less, of its entire length. 



B. The second modification is afforded by the crested species 

 {Eudyptes proper). (PI. 4, fig. 1.) The rostrum is shorter or no 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 183 



longer than the rest of the skull, very stout, in particular extremely 

 broad and obtuse. The nasal opening is correspondingly short. 

 The upper prong of the nasal bone is partlj' or wholly free from 

 the premaxillar3\ (Fig. 2.) The palatines are imperfectly auchy- 

 losed with the maxillfe. The z3-gomata are extremely curved, 

 looping downward from the maxillo-jugal suture. The mandible 

 is abruptl}' deepened at its middle into a broad plate, and shows 

 no vacuit}' between the symphj'seal and following elements. The 

 angle of the mandible lies in front of the mastoid plane. The 

 smooth interorbital space is narrow on top of the skull, since the 

 glandular depressions reach the anteorbital prominences. The 

 temporal fossjB are very shallow, widely apart, and merely sepa- 

 rated from the depression between themselves and the cerebellar 

 protuberance by a slight bony ridge. The greatest width of the 

 skull is nearly half its length. 



C. Sjjheniscus demersus shows a third modification. (Figs. 3, 4.) 

 The rostrum is longer or no shorter than the rest of the skull, 

 verj' stout, in particular extremely- deep, with the apex hooked 

 above, truncate below. The nasal opening is correspondingly 

 short. The upper prong of the nasal bone is almost completely 

 anchylosed with the premaxillary. The palatines are extensively 

 anchj'losed Avith the maxillae. The zygomata are curved but 

 slightly downward. The mandible is deepened very slightly and 

 graduall}", and shows no vacuity between the symphyseal and 

 succeeding elements. The angle of the mandible is below, if not 

 behind the mastoid plane. The smooth interorbital space on top 

 is narrow or reduced to a ridge. The temporal fossae are ex- 

 tremely deep, meet each other on the median line on top of the skull, 

 and are completely isolated from the depressions on either side of 

 the cerebellar protuberance by a strong flange-like plate of bone. 

 The greatest width of the skull is about two-fifths of its length. 



It will ])e observed that each of these types has its own pecu- 

 liarities. Thus A stands alone in characters of the rostrum; C is 

 isolated in the singularity of its temporal fossae ; B is peculiar in 

 the dip of the jugal and depth of mandible ; and the other charac- 

 ters vary in intensity of expression with each one. JJut there are 

 in each case other characters that are shared with one other, but 

 not with both the others ; and it is these combinations that render 

 the three distinct. 1 propose to establish genera upon thcni. 




184 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



One skull of tj'p.e B, of an undetermined species,^ shows, among 

 some peculiarities that I regard as simply specific, the presence 

 of small and slender but perfectly plain basipterj'goid processes, 

 of which I see no trace in any other specimen. 



As already intimated, I cannot say whether or not these cranial 

 tj'pes shade into each otlier, or whether species not examined do 

 not show something different from either of these three patterns, 

 nor, finally, with which one of the three the unexamined species may 

 aoree. It seems to me that the species minor agrees so closely in 

 external characters with C that its reference to the genus Sphe- 

 niscus is warranted. For the same reasons, the species antiioodes 

 seems allied to B. In the uncertainty at present attaching to 

 pajnia, adeliee, and anfarctica, it may be best to leave these to 

 stand on their own merits in the genus " Pygoscelis,^' -which, how- 

 ever, can then only be characterized by the extreme length of the 

 tail and the feathering of the bill, since the form of the bill differs 

 greatly in each of the three. These genera would correspond 

 very nearly with the sections Dr. Sehlegel has indicated, and are 

 exactly those of Prof. Hyatt. The latter has shown how difficult 

 it is to define the genera, seeing that they vary with whatever 

 character we take as our guide. On the whole, I think it most 

 probable that no more than three genera will be finally deter- 

 minable, namely, Aptenodytes, Eudyptes, and Spheniscus, though 

 the second of these may contain subgenera, based upon shape 

 and feathering of the bill, presence or absence of crests, and 

 length of tail. 



The cranial characters just described will be readily appreciated 

 by reference to the accompanying figures (Fig. 4), kindly drawn for 

 this paper by my friend, Prof. Morse. It was not thought neces- 

 sary to give a figure of Aptenodytes, as a beautiful engraving has 

 already been presented in Prof. Brandt's invaluable article. Thesb 

 figures are all of two-thirds size ; those representing vertical views 

 show the skull from above, on the one side, and from below 

 (with the mandible removed) on the other side, of the median 

 lengthwise line. 



In its general characters the skull conforms to the ordinary 

 pygopodous type. The palate is schizognathous. The inter-

 syrhamphus" adelim, but there is no certainty about this. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PIIILADELnilA. 1S5 



orbital scplura lias a large vaouit3- ; its thickened lower border 

 curves gently forward and upward. The vomer is slight and 

 readily detached. Tlie optic foraniiiui are merged in a large 

 vacuit}' ; the foramina in front of the ear are large and distinct. 

 The mastoid and postorbital are both prominent ; tlie depressions 

 for lodgment of the gland are well marked. The pterygoids are 

 remarkable for their breadth anteriorl}', forming somewhat tri- 

 angular lamina?, instead of irregular cylinders of bone. The 

 palatines are large, very broad posteriorly, and thin. The max- 

 illo-palatines, on the other hand, are verj' small and simple. The 

 very large and irregular lachrymals are permanently free from 

 surrounding bones, and seem to be usually (but not always) fenes- 

 trated with a large foramen. A prominent peculiarity of the 

 skull is the loose connection of the bones of both jaws. The 

 nasals are never entirely' confluent with either maxillaries or pre- 

 maxillaries, and they are sometimes distinct tliroughout. The 

 posterior cuds of the median prongs of tlie premaxillaries commonly 

 remain distinct from tlie nasals embracing tliem, and frequently 

 are not even anch^dosed with each otlier. Traces of the maxillo- 

 premaxillary, maxillo-palatal,and maxillo-jugal sutures are usually 

 verj' plain ; and in the lower jaw, most of the original elements 

 remain more or less distinct throughout life. None of the cranial 

 bones appear to be pneumatic. 



An incomplete skeleton of Ap(cno(hjles pennantii furnishes the 

 following additional osteological data (PI. 5; figs, all of nat 

 size) : — 



All the bones of the wing are flat and solid. 



The humerus (Fig. 5), about 4^ iuclies long, has an average 

 ■width of an inch, and a thickness of about ^ of an inch. It is 

 perfectl}' laminar, except the globular expansion at its head. Tliis 

 portion lies oblique to the general axis of the bone, the general 

 convexity' of the articular surface presenting inward and jjack- 

 ward. The whole of this expanded surface is, in clfect, the dome 

 roofing over an immense antrum, into whicii the whole end of 

 one's finger may Itc thrust. The articular siiiface is somewhat 

 crescentic in general outline; anteric^rly it slopes to the pioini- 

 nence representing the "greater tuberosity," which is directly 

 continuous with the front edge of the bone. Inside this ridge 

 there is a deep groove, and along the inner border of the articular 

 surface lie two fossa? separated by a ridge. Hut the distal exlrem- 

 13 




186 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



ity of the bone is still more peculiar — showing a characteristic of 

 the faniil}' onl}- shared, to a certain extent, b}' Alca impennu. (Fig. 

 6). The bone is cut off obliquely, at an angle of about 45°, with 

 a straight edge. The anterior three-fifths of this is occupied with 

 the two facets for articulation with the bones of the forearm. 

 These facets are continuous, and the radial one scarcely shows 

 the particular elliptical shape common among birds. The pos- 

 terior extremit}^ of this oblique end of the humerus is prolonged 

 far be^^ond the true elbow joint, funiishing a resting place for the 

 two large anconal sesamoids. The very end is deepl}' grooved, 

 and another similar groove is impressed upon the bone on the 

 outside, a little higher up. The sesamoids are in these grooves. 

 The structure of the elbow is such as to allow but very restricted 

 motion ; the forearm can be flexed out slightly from its usual posi- 

 tion of nearly complete extension. 



The larger, outer one of the two sesamoids is an irregularly 

 discoidal bone, with a smooth, flat, external face, and curved outer 

 border; its sharpened edge fits in the upper of the two grooves 

 at the extremity of the humeinis; the prominence of the hu- 

 merus that defines this groove abuts against a slight excavation on 

 the outer surface of the sesamoids. The smaller sesamoid lies a 

 little beliind and inside the other; it has one flat face applied 

 against the surface of the other, an irregular surface with a cen- 

 tral ridge fitting into the extreme groove of the humerus, and a 

 long, curved, postero-external free border. These sesamoids, 

 borne upon the most projecting point of the humerus, aff"ord an 

 extremely powerful leverage for extension of the forearm. 



The ulna and radius are similar to each other in general appear- 

 ance, both being laminar, like the humerus, with a sudden thick- 

 ening and constriction at the proximal extremity'-, so that the 

 articular facets are irregularly' circular. The distal extremitj' of 

 the ulna is pretty effectually^ divided into two facets, a posterior 

 excavation in which the head of the ulnare articulates, and a 

 superior prominence abutting against a surface of the radiale. The 

 distal extremity of the radius shows a single convex articular sur- 

 face fitting the concavity of the radiale. The outer surface is 

 obliquely impressed for a long distance with a distinct groove for 

 a tendon; the anterior margin of the radius is a straight, sharp 

 crest, more prominent than the opposite edge of the ulna. The 

 two bones of the forearm have very intimate relations to each 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 1S7 



other only at tlieir proximal extremity, being barely in mutual 

 contact at the wrist; but in consequence of their straightness, 

 their edges lie parallel in the contiiiuit}' — not presenting the ellip- 

 tical interspace commonly seen in birds' forearms. 



The radiale is not specially noteworthy ( Fig. T), being a simple, 

 somewhat cubical nodule with distal and proximal articular con- 

 cavity for the metacarpus and radius respectivel}', another articu- 

 lar face for the protuberance of the ulna, two free faces, and an 

 anterior extremity for tendinous attachment. The ulnare, on the 

 other hand, is of extraordinary, if not unique, shape and size. It 

 develops an immense lamellar expansion of the curious sliape 

 shown in the figure, the real bodv of the bone appearing as a mere 

 process wedged in betwixt the ends of the ulna and metacarpus. 

 If, as I presume, the flexor carpi ulnaris has its customarj' inser- 

 tion into this bone, the increase of leverage must be enormous. 



The single metacarpal bone is peculiar in several respects. It 

 bears no poUical phalanx, and the crest that ordinarily indicates, 

 in the composition of this bone, tlie originally distinct radial met- 

 acarpal is here obscure, not being differentiated to any consider- 

 able degree from the general laminar expansion. The ulnar 

 metacarpal has no convexity ; its fusion with the main metacar[);d 

 is perfect for nearh- its proximate half, and again at the distal 

 extremity — a narrow linear fenestration separating it in the rest 

 of its extent. Tiie head of the bone represents one continuous 

 articular surface for the radiale and ulnare, flat sideways, strongly 

 convex fore and aft. At the distal extremity, however, there are 

 two perfectly distinct articular facets — an oval one for the radial 

 phalanx, and a small circular one for the ulnar phalanx. The bone 

 is nearlj' three inciies long, and rather less than one-third as l)roa<l. 



The proximal radial phalanx is a straight, flattened, rectangu- 

 lar blade of bone, with four sharp corners, a sharp anterior and 

 posterior border, and an oval articular surface at either end. It 

 is two inches long and half an inch broad. The distal phalanx is 

 simply a flattened spur, with sharp edges, tapering to an obtuse 

 point; it is about h:df an incli long. Th(,' ulnar digit, however, is 

 of unusual size, reaching beyond the end of the proximal radinl 

 phalanx. It has a stout head, whence a process is developed, and 

 then tapers regularly to tiie ciid. It is less obviously HatfenL-il 

 than tiie other bones of the hantl. 



The bones of the leg conform closely to the general pygopodous 




188 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



type. The patella, however, is of immense size, aud of an indes- 

 cribable, irregular shape. According to Owen, it develops from 

 two centres — a matter interesting in connection with the presence 

 of two sesamoids in the elbow. The tibia is a bone about eight 

 inches long, and nearly cylindrical in its continuit3\ It closely 

 corresponds, in general, with the same bone of a loon, for example, 

 except that it does not develop the long apophysis above the 

 knee-joint. There is a considerable protuberance, however, above 

 the plane of the articulation, formed by the extension of two sharp 

 cuemial ridges that meet above, defining a long deep fossa that lies 

 between them. The distal extremity offers nothing peculiar; the 

 osseous bridge for confinement of the flexor tendons is perfect, 

 and the trochlear surface has the usual configuration. The fibula 

 is six inches long, and extremely slender from above the middle 

 downwards. It abuts against the tibia at both ends, and also 

 for about an inch of its length at a place nearly half-wa}' down. 

 Elsewhere, the interspace between the two bones is considerable. 



The ankle-joint has a peculiar free, persistent ossicle, about the 

 size and shape of a split pea. It appears to be a sesamoid, and it 

 lies on the posterior aspect of tlie joint ; but owing to an unfor- 

 tunate inadvertence in the preparation of the specimen, its exact 

 position and relations were not made out. 



The tarso-metatarsus (Fig. 8) is the most remarkable bone of 

 the skeleton in several respects, and the one more particularly 

 diagnostic of the family. Penguins afi"ord probably the only in- 

 stances, among recent birds, of width crosswise being decidedly 

 greater than thickness antero-posteriorly, and more than half the 

 length; and the only case of persistence throughout life of fenes- 

 tra marking the composition of the bone of three originally dis- 

 tinct metatarsals. In the present species, the bone is rather under 

 two inches long, from an inch to one inch and a third wide at 

 different points. The front shows two deep grooves lengthwise 

 from one end to the other, and in each of these grooves there is 

 an oval perforation, that would about admit the passage of a 

 goose-quill. Behind, the corresponding grooves are nearly obso- 

 lete. The proximal extremity is an uninterrupted articular sur- 

 face for the tibial condyles, the inner impression being much the 

 more strongly marked. The distal extremity is deeply' cleft in 

 two places, the three metacarpal prongs being completely isolated. 

 The central one of these projects beyond the lateral ones. The 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PniLADELPHIA. 189 



articular faces have the usual contour; all being grooved perpen- 

 dicularh-, and the lateral ones showing that ordiuar}- but highly 

 interesting kind of obliquity, bj' means of which the toes, -when 

 flexed, are brought side b}' side, and made to diverge from each 

 other -when extended. 



In the dried bone, no special surface for attachment of the ac- 

 cessor}^ metatarsal can be recognized. The first digit is extremely 

 small, completely lateral, closely' joined with the base of the sec- 

 ond toe, and appears in its usual position during life to be turned 

 more or less completely forward. Technically, it may be consid- 

 ered "elevated," though the disparity in size between these and 

 the other toes is so great that it is difficult to sa}- how much, if 

 an}', above the plane of the rest it is reall}' situated. It appears 

 to have little or no functional importance, although all its bones 

 are present and morphicall}' perfect. The accessory metatarsal is 

 a straight, slender bone, about half an inch long, irregularly flat- 

 tened ; the proximal phalanx is similar but still smaller, while the 

 distal phalanx is a mere spiculum about a fourth of an inch long. 



The other three toes are of ordinary size ; the middle one exceeds 

 the outer a little, ■while the inner is considerably the shortest; all 

 show the normal number of phalanges (3-4-5, from 2d to 4tlO. 

 The phalanges of each toe, as usual, decrease in length and bulk 

 from flrst to last, and the corresponding ones of different toes 

 bear to each other the usual relative size. The distal phalanges 

 have enlarged processes for the support of the heavy, blunt claws, 

 and these processes are deeply grooved on each side. 



III. OX THE GEOGRAPHICAL IMSTUmrTIOX OF TlTi: 



FAMILY. 



It is well known that the jienguins are entirely confined to tiie 

 southern hemisphere, and their nortliorn limit of dispersion is 

 probably ascertained witii approximate accurac}'. Their nearest 

 approach to the equator seems to be on tlie coast of South 

 America. According to Me3'cn, the S. ^^hnmboldtiV^ {dc.merAUit) 

 is abundant in the harbor of Callao, Peru, lat. 10^ S. ; wliile this 

 Spheniacus reaches on the other side of this continent to Southern 

 Brazil, and Ascension Island, lat. 8^ ^.{LirhL). Dr. Schlegel 

 places the African limit at ■25'^, and the Australian at 3;")" S., 

 properly ignoring tiie accounts of Sonnerat, whose representations 




190 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



of the occiuTence of penguins, as given in his " Voyage," are in 

 all probability erroneous. On the other hand, some species of 

 penguins have been found apparently as far as voyagers have 

 penetrated toward the pole. Such highly antarctic species are 

 tlie Pygoscelis adcliee, and antarctica, named from their habitat, 

 and the Aptenodytes patachonica, seen by Peale in lat. 66° 52'. 



The Falkland Islands appear to be a centre of the famil}^, no 

 less than half of the known species occurring there. 



A number of the species are very extensively dispersed, having, 

 as it were, a circumpolar mode of distribution. Such are some 

 of the crested species, the " papuan" penguin, and especially the 

 Spheniscus demersus. This last appears to have the most exten- 

 sive distribution, both in latitude and in longitude, of any ; and 

 since it varies, like other birds, with a change of habitat, this may 

 account for the exceptional number of nominal species that have 

 been established at its expense. As far as is known, two species 

 constitute an exception to the general rule, being confined to a 

 comparatively limited area ; these are the Spheniscus minor and 

 Eudijptes antipodes^ inhabiting the Australian region. 



As Dr. Schlegel remarks, the precise habitat of each species 

 cannot be given as yet ; and this will not be possible without 

 much more information than we now possess, respecting the 

 places where the different species propagate, and especially in 

 regard to their movements, whether irregular and contingent, or 

 periodical, according to season of the j-ear.

 Expl. Exped. : basis of PeaZe, pp. 258, 335, sp. No. 691, and of 

 Cassin, pp. 349, 450, sp. No. 681. This specimen, as mounted, 

 stands about 3^ feet high, but appears somewhat overstuffed ; 

 wing 14 inches, tail about 3, bill along culmen 8, along gape 

 almost 5, from antise to tip of bill 2. The bill is feathered beyond 

 its middle, the antise reaching more than half-waj' from angle of 

 the mouth to tip, and these feathers conceal the maxillar tomia 

 for a great distance. On the under mandible the feathers com- 

 pletely fill the interramal space, and also cover much of the side 

 of the lower mandible, leaving, towai'ds the base, only the ex- 

 panded and colored edge of the mandible naked. The tarsi are 

 entirely covered with feathers, which furthermore overlie the toes 

 for some distance; but onlj' a part of the tarsus is implanted 

 with feathers, the rest being reticulate with small six-sided plates, 

 as are also the upper surfaces of the toes, except just at the end, 

 where there are 2-3 annular scales. The hallux is minute, rela- 

 tively smaller than in any other species, and almost perfectly 

 antrorse ; the lateral toes are sub-equal to each other, but the 2d 

 is a little shorter than the 4th ; the tips of the claws of both 

 overreach the base of the 3d claw. Claws enormously stout and 

 blunt; 2d 1.20, od 1.50, 4th 1.25 long. This bird appears to be

 of the sides of the neck stands an isolated black stripe, running 

 upward from the shoulder, stopping abruptly, not reaching the

to tip of bill 2.50. While a much smaller bird than pataehonica 

 (Forsteri), it is thus seen that the wings, tail, and feet are rela- 

 tivelj' longer, and that the bill, besides being relatively longer, 

 is actually made of equal length, if not absolutely longer, in con- 

 sequence of the less extent to which the feathers of the front 

 encroach upon the upper mandible, the antioe falling short of half 

 the distance between angle of the mouth and tip of the bill. 

 Another and yet stronger character is, that the sides of the under 

 mandible are entirel}' naked, whereas in jiatachonica (Forst.) the 

 feathers encroach so much that hindwards onlj^ the tomial edge of 

 the mandible remains bare. This difference heightens the seeminsr 

 greater size of the bill of pennantii ; it likewise makes the brightly 

 colored area larger, and gives it a different shape. The tarsi of 

 2:>ennantii are entirely naked, and not even hidden by the tibial 

 plumes; whereas \n pataehonica (F.) the tarsi are largely' ptilose, 

 and wholly hidden by feathers, as are also the bases of the toes. 

 The general piclura of the plumage is the same ; but the neck 

 shows a verj' noticeable difference, the gular black running far 

 down in a sharp point embraced betwixt the forks of the narrow 

 median anterior jugular line of j'ellow that after bifurcating 

 mounts on either side of the neck and head, there to form a large 

 very 3'ellow spot, bounded immediately by the dark color of the 

 neighboring parts ; and moreovei', the isolated black line running 

 up in the whitish of the side of the neck from the shoulder 

 towards the throat, as observed in the Smithsonian specimen of 

 p)atagonica^ is not seen here. 



I am not satisfied, however, that these precise points of color- 

 ation are sufficiently distinctive of the species as compared with 

 its congener. It is probable that the only reliable characters are 

 to be found in the larger size, proportionally shorter members, 

 much more extensively feathered bill, and feathered tarsi, of 

 patagonica ; and all these points seem to be accounted for b}' a 

 difference in habitat, p)atagonica being more decidedly antarctic 

 than longiroslris.

rior hordei' broadly white. The bill of this species stands quite 

 aloue among the penguins, savijig Apfenodyfes, in its length and 

 slenderuess and in the length combined with narrowness of the 

 frontal antias. AVhilst the culmen measures 2.75, the distance from 

 the nasal feathers to the tip of the bill is only about 1.60 ; the 

 nostrils are completely hidden, and not easy to discover in the 

 dried state. The bill is really longer than it looks, the rictus 

 measuring 5 inches ; the progression of the feathers on the bill is 

 a condition essentially similar to that of adelise: although the bills 

 of the two look so different, this is merely due to the length of 

 the terminal part in tseniata. If the terminal portion were cut off 

 an inch, the bill of taeniata would be essentially similar to that of 

 adelise. Sharing other features, especiallj' the ver}- long tail, adeliae 

 and tseniata seem to be most closely- related species ; and despite 

 the difference in the bill, I think that the skulls of the two will be 

 found of a single pattern. Some ornithologist will do good service 

 by noticing the skulls and seeing whether they agree, and if so, 

 how they compare with the three types of cranial structure. I am 

 induced to surmise that the resemblance will be found closest with 

 Aptenodytes.

 tail is very long, the central feathers being upwards of T inches, 

 though the lateral are only about 2, in consequence of the extreme 

 graduation ; all the rectrices are merely narrow linear laminie, like 

 pieces of whalebone with frayed edges. The tibial feathers cover 

 the tarsus in front, but none grow on tiie tarsus itself, which 

 is very short — onl}' about an inch. Middle toe and claw 3.00 ; 

 inner do. 2.25, outer do. 2.50 ; nails very long, but blunt; webs 

 emarginate. The podotheca is entirely reticulate, except a few 

 annular .scales at the ends of the toes. The bill is very short,- 

 narrow and deep, and densely feathered beyond its middle. The 

 autiai reach within an inch of the tip, entirely covering the nos- 

 trils ; the broad rounded-depressed aud decurved culmen runs in 

 a point on the forehead ; its chord is 1.50 long. The feathers of 

 the antia", and tliose between the mandibular rami, slope so 

 obliquel}' and rapidly towards the edges of tlie bill, that the 

 naked portion of the tomia is ouly 1.75 inches long, though the 

 whole gape measures 2.50 ; the feathery extension in the inter- 

 ramal space i.s within .75 of the tip of the mandible. Dejtth of 

 bill at base over .90. The short nasal groove is very narrow and 

 oblique, running into the tomia behind tlie lio6keil portiou, and 

 behind widening into a. feathered fossa wliere the nostrils lie This 

 specimen, as mounted, now stands a trifle over 2 feet higii, but 

 measures about 33^ inches (its length in the flesh was 31 inches — 

 Peale). The bill is wholly dark colored — probabl}- it showed 

 some reddish in life; the feet appear to have been flesh-colored.

Although we repose great confidence in the judgment of the 

 accomplished ornithologist who latel}^ proposed to separate from 

 adelise a specimen in Count Ercole Turati's collection, yet we 

 cannot hesitate to refer E. hercnlis to this species, even without 

 examining the tj^pe. For according to Dr. Fiusch's own showing, 

 the only tangible difference lies in the white throat, which is surely 

 a mark of immature plumage, however adult the specimen may 

 otherwise appear. Every one of the black-throated penguins 

 (all the fiimily except minor and ant arctic us.) have the throat white 

 at first ; and in several cases we have actually traced the change, 

 by insensible degrees. The British Museum examples, with white 

 throat, lately printed by Mr. Gray as ^'' hercidis^''^ were never sus- 

 pected to be aught else than young adelise^ before Dr. Finsch's 

 article appeared. Dr. Schlegel reports a precisely similar " in- 

 dividu au premier plumage, de taille raoins forte et offrant la gorge 

 blanche, terre Yictoria, acquis in 1863 ;" and we recognize the 

 same condition in this one of the Academy's specimens. 



The Aptenodytes longicauda of Peale was promptl}'^ identified 

 with adeliee by Cassin ; and Mr. Gray soon recognized the same 

 species in his PygOscelis brevi^'oatris.

The foregoing description is copied from Dr. Schlegel, who

In the length of tail, feathering of the bill, and some other 

 characters, it seems related to tseniata and adcJire^ and to be 

 referable to the genus Pygoscelis. It forms, with S. viinor, an 

 exception to the general rule of coloration among i^enguins, in 

 that the throat persists white.

 mage, from the Auckland Is., U. S. Ex. Ex., T. R. Peale : type of 

 Apt. favilarvata Peole, I. c. ; basis of Cass. I.e. There are no 

 true lateral crests as in the typical species of Eudi/j^tes, but all the 

 feathers of the face, and most of those of the cro^vn, are length- 

 ened and linear. The yellow of the cheeks and crown has a dull 

 soiled shade, and that of the crown is sharply streaked with fine 

 black lines, one on each feather ; the unlengthened feathers of the 

 hind head, and those over the auriculars and through the 63^68, 

 form a well-marked band of much brighter and purer sulphur yel- 

 low ; the lower parts of the head, and uppermost of the neck, 

 including the throat, have a peculiar brownish cast; and, alto- 

 gether, the head markings are unique in the family. The under 

 parts are white, up to the slight gular brownish just mentioned; 

 the upper parts are of a pale watery blue, more dilute than on an 

 average among the other species. The head markings, and length- 

 ened feathers of the vertex, together with the points of form here 

 to follow, show how the species is a link between true Spheniscus 

 and typical Eudyptes. Bill stoutish, straight, tip fairly hooked, 

 but under mandible hardly truncate, nasal sulcus as usual. The 

 antifE run out pointedl}^, about ^ of an inch bej^ond base of cul- 

 men, but still do not conceal the nostrils ; from their apices, the 

 feathers rapidly retreat, to angle of the mouth, leaving the maxil- 

 lar tomia entirel}^ bare, while those on the under mandible simi- 

 larly expose the whole tomia, although between the rami they 

 reach within less than an inch of the end of the bill. Chord of 

 culmen 2.10 ; depth of bill .85 ; antia; to tip 1.75 ; gape 3.00 : the 

 anterior canthus is just over the angle of the mouth. Tail very 

 short (under 2 inches), and much rounded, as in Spheniscus de- 

 mersus or minor. The whole length of the bird is somewhat over 

 2 feet. 



Schlegel reports one of the t^^pes of the species from the

 According to Gray, tlie British Museum examples are from the

Obs. This species is at once distinguished among the crested 

 ones by the shortness of the tail, which in size and shape rather 

 recalls S. deviersus. This member is under three inches long, 

 rounded, of fourteen narrow stitlish graduated rectriccs. From 

 either chrysocome or chrysolopha it is also known b}' its inforit>r 

 size ; and from chrysocome, its nearest all}', bj' the quite blue 

 upper parts, as in chrysolopha, the color of the back of '•^'/•"-

Til is appears to have been the earliest described of the crolid 

 species, and its synonym}' is in such a state of confusion with 

 that of the following, tiiat probably it is now impossible to com-

 feathers moderately lengthened, those of the forehead not reach-

 base of the culmen over the eye, to the occiput, and there forms 

 a curly tuft an inch longer. This specimen certainly shows 

 nothing whatever different from ordinary cJuysocome, nor does 

 Gould's description (I. c.) give any tangible characters. He says, 

 indeed, that his bird is "smaller than chrysocome^^'' but the dimen- 

 sions he assigns (length 21;^; bill 2; tail 4; tarsi §) do not bear 

 out this statement; nor do any of the other characters hold. "We 

 judge from the nature of Mr. Gould's remarks that he compared 

 his bird with chrysolopha, from which it is different in the respects 

 he mentions. In any event, we full}' concur with Prof. Schlegel,

 1.60 long, by nearly one inch deep. The specimen is labelled

No. . . . Mus. Bost. Soc, no localitj^ given, Coll. La Fresna3'e. 

 (Hyatt.) 



This species, if it be different from catarrh actes, is to be distin- 

 guished by the rather larger size, very stout bill, decidedly longer 

 tail, and prevalent darkness of the back, and especiall}' the head. 

 From clirysolopha it may be known by the less development of 

 the crests, darker color, and heavier bill. 



It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to pick out, among 

 the earlier notices of this species and caiar-rhactes, the names and 

 descriptions that respectivel}' ^pply to these tAvo. Mr. Gray, in- 

 deed, throws all the eighteenth century synonymj- upon cataj-rhac- 

 tes, considering that his pachyrhyncha represents the original 

 description of the present species ; and it would be advantageous 

 to agree with him on this point. But I cannot help thinking that 

 Forster had two different species in view, tliat he named respec- 

 tivel}^ Qalai^rhactes (after Briss.) and chrysocome (n. sp.). 



It is also Dr. Schlegel's opinion tliat Forster indicated the 

 two species, so that I hardly see how he (Dr. Schlegel) relegates 

 chrysocome, Gmelin and P. E. 984, to catarrhactes ; for Gmelin 

 quotes Forster, and whatever species Forster's is, that Gmelin's 

 must also be. The Blanche Enlum., also, shows a very darl*- bird. 

 I know that in this matter my judgment is quite as likely to be 

 at fault as Dr. Schlegel's is, but 1 think that, all things considered, 

 it may be best to accept the synonymy as it is here arranged, let- 

 ting " chrysocome " mean chiysocome, and " catarrhactes " mean 

 catarrhactes, in everj^ instance, without attempting an identifica- 

 tion upon the vague and unsatisfactory descriptions that the 

 older authors gave.

No. . . . Mas. Acad., Philada. Xo locality given. Tlic upper 

 parts are rather lighter colored (bluer) than in cJn-ijsocome (luucli 

 as in catarrhactea)^ but tlie difference is not well marked ; the head, 

 however, has a decided bluish cast hardly visible in the opaque 

 black of chnjsocome. All the coronal feathers are longer, more 

 slender, and stiffer than I have ever seen them in chri/socome, 

 extending nearlj' two inches beyond the occiput, and forming a 

 median vertical black crest connecting the yellow lateral i)lumes. 

 The longest yellow plumes are full 3 inches in lengtli, and reach 

 over 4 inches behind the eye — about 7 inches from the tip of the 

 bill : they are accompanied to their very ends by a few of the long- 

 est black plumes. This is a condition I have never seen equalled 

 in any specimen of chnjsocome^ though the difference after all is 

 not so decided. The bill is no shorter than in some specimens of 

 chrysocome (the chord of culmen measuring 1§ inches long) ; but 

 it is weaker than I have ever seen it in that species, l)eing hardly 

 I of an inch deep. The tail is about 4 inches long ; middle toe 

 and claw nearly 3.00. 



Xo. . . . Mus. Acad., Phila. Xo locality assigned. Exactly 

 like the last, but the crests not quite so highl}' developed, though 

 they are still noticeably longer than in chi'ijsocome. The bluish 

 cast of the ujipcr parts, and even of tlie head, is well marked.

According to Dr. Schlegel, it is this species tiiat is indicated 

 in Gould's Handbook, p. 517, under the name of Eadyplcs "calar- 

 ractes;^^ and by Pelzeln, Xovara Keise, p. 140, pi. 5, under the name 

 of Eudypfes '•'' chrysocomey We do not, however, venture to so 

 assign these names in our s3Mion3-my, especially since Dr. Schlegel 

 is certainly wrong in his identification of Gould's '■^ chrysocome.^^ 



Although I am able to distinguish the three eurrently accredited 

 species, in the few specimens examined, yet the distinctions aro 

 not of a very satisfactory nature, and I strongly suspect that 

 when specimens enough shall have been compared, the supposed 

 specific characters will melt insensibly into each other, so that, 

 at most, only varietal distinction can be rcasonabl3' asserted.

Indeed, I am not sure that differences of age or season or special 

 conditions of plumage may not be the sole basis of the supposed 

 species.

No. 59,241, Mus. Smiths., adult, in perfect plumage, from the 

 Falkland Islands, received under the name of "Eud. chrysolopha." 

 The upper parts are very dark, with barely a trace of dull pen- 

 guin-blue in some places, in others, as on the head, none at all. 

 (In these respects quite different from its nearest all}', chrysolo- 

 pha.) The intense yellow plumes, very slender, and perfectly 

 straiglit, reach hai'dly an inch beyond the sides of the occiput 

 (the}' are longer, curly, and not so 5'ellow, in the other species) ; 

 and on the forehead they coalesce to form a large orange spot, 

 with sharp black lines, the terminal half of each feather being- 

 black. (In all the other three crested species the lateral bundles 

 of yellow plumes remain strictly separate.) The other feathers 

 of the crown are perfectly black, and not much lengthened. Bill 

 larger and more robust than in the other crested species ; nasal 

 groove very strongly impressed, dividing the maxilla into the 

 broad, depressed, culminal part, and the bulging tomial portions ; 

 on the under mandible the feathers ascend backwards from their 

 point of extension between the rami, as usual, but do not reach 

 the toraia at all, but retreat to the very angle of the mouth ; while 

 the corneous part of the mandible is defined along the line of 

 these feathers by a raised border. Chord of culmen 2.25 ; gape 

 2.50 ; from antife to tip of bill 1.75 ; height of bill opposite base 

 of culmen 1.15; width do. .85 ; wing nearly 8 ; tail 5.25; tarsus 

 about 1 ; middle toe and claw 2.15 ; whole length of the dried 

 skin, apparently not stretched, 2^ feet. 



No. . . . Mus. Acad., Philada. No locality given. Adult ; as 

 stuffed, stands 22 inches high ; chord of culmen 2.15 ; gape 2.T5, 

 but not quite 1 deep at deepest place ; tail about 4^ ; wing 8;^ . 

 Similar to the Smithsonian specimen. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 201 



No. . . . !Mus. Acad., Philada., male, adult, '' Isles Croquets ;" 

 almost exactly' like the preceding ; bill uot quite so large ; stands 

 about 2H inches high. 



No. . . . Mus. Acad., Phila., "Isle Macquarie." Young, or at 

 least imperfect plumage, the throat and sides of the head below 

 the eyes being white, slightly clouded with dusk}', indicating the 

 blackish area of the mature state ; but the plumes are as largely 

 developed, the forehead is as 3'cllow, and the l»ill is as large as in 

 the adults above mentioned. It seems to be exactly like spec. 

 No. 3 of Dr. Schlegel's catalogue, and is from the same locality. 

 This concurrence of white throat with intensely yellow forehead 

 is rather in favor of the validity of the species. 



These specimens appear to have stood a long time unrecognized 

 in the Academy, the richness of the ornithological department of 

 which only graduall}' appears. They are unquestionably diadema- 

 tus. We are also pleased to identify with this beautiful species, 

 •which seems strongh^ marked, and is at sa^y rate recognizable on 

 sight by the orange forehead and other characters, a specimen 

 that has lain for some time in the Smithsonian, labelled ^' cliryso- 

 lopha^ It does not appear to be contained in the British Mu- 

 seum. Dr. Schlegel reports three examples at Leyden ; two 

 adults, one from the Falklands, the other from New Zealand ; and 

 an " individu a gorge et cotes de la tete blancs, du reste au plu- 

 mage parfait ; lie Macquarie, au sud de la Nouv. Zeelande." 



? A shade of doubt attaches, that this may be au extreme case 

 of chrysolopha; for we have in the Eud. nigj'iveslis of Gould, 

 which is not distinct from chi'i/.socoma^ a state of plumage as dark 

 as that of diadematus. But diademalu^ is distinguishable on 

 sight, and no intermediate specimens have been forthcoming.

 as mounted, a foot high ; wasproloably 14 inches long ; wing 4.25 ; 

 tail 1.25 ; the rectrices scarcely surpassing the tectrices ; culmen 

 of bill, 1.25; gape, 1.T5 ; from anti^e to tip, only 1.00 ; depth of 

 bill at base, .45, its width there .25 ; tarsus .*75 ; middle toe and 

 claw, 1.66. The feet are wholly reticulate with hexagonal plates ; 

 the hullux is completely lateral, the end of its nail barely touch- 

 ing the ground. The color of the feet is now undistinguishable ; 

 but the webs and the toes towards their end appear to have been 

 darker than the rest. The bill is much shorter than the head, 

 slenderish, compressed, the hook of the maxilla barel}' overarching 

 tlie end of the mandible; the nostrils are entirely unfeathered, 

 and lie in a deep narrow sulcus that runs obliquely into the max- 

 illary tomium at the beginning of its decurvature ; the antite are 

 acute, but only run out a little be3'ond the feathers on culmen, 

 falling short of the nostrils. Feathers occlude the interramal 

 space, and retreat in a straight line, obliquely upward and back- 

 ward, to the angle of the mouth. Thus the bill is most like that 

 of Spheniscus demersus in general characters, but somewhat ap- 

 proaches that of Pygoscelis. This is one of the onl^^ two penguins 

 that never gain a dark throat; the pictura is perfectly simple — 

 blue above, white below ; the line of demarcation passes straight 

 through the eye, shoulder, and thigh ; a spot at the end of the 

 under surface of the wing is blue, and the border of the wing is 

 white.

 1340 is 1.25, just as in Xo. 1338, and X'o. 15601. I cannot dis- 

 tinguish these specimens even as a variet}'. 



Hyatt reports another of the \J. S. Ex. Ex. specimens in the 

 Boston Society's Museum, and one from the Coll. La Fresnaye ; 

 these, and several quoted by Gray and Schlegel, are all from the 

 one or another of the localities above mentioned, and to which 

 the species seems confined. 



We cannot discover, in Gould's undina, any specific characters. 

 The bird is one of the bluest of the penguins ; and the shade of 

 the plumage, as well as the hue of the bill and feet, varies with 

 age or other changeable circumstances.

 The bill is one of the smallest (of Spheniscus proper) we haA'e seen ; 

 the rugous parts are shrunken, and much of the bill is yellowish; 

 the upper parts are lighter and bluer than is usual in this variety, 

 and much as in ordinary demersus. There is no trace of the dark 

 breast-band or of the lateral stripe; but the cervical half-collar 

 distinctive of vuKjellatricusis jjlainl}' apparent. This lias decided 

 us as to the proper determination of the specimen ; and of course, 

 with this identification, comes the reference of Peale's magniros- 

 tris, and Cassin's " demersus," here instead of to true demersus. 

 In fact, we find the specimen labelled "magellanicus?" in a hand- 

 writing we do not recognize, and we observe that Mr. Cassin has 

 queried his private No. 083, which refers to his catalogue {<>ji. rit. 

 p. 45U, No. 083), although there and on p. 354 (o}). cit.) he lots the

August 6. 

 The President, Dr. Ruschenberger, in the chair, 

 I^lne members present. 



Note on Cotius G7-(i'nlandicu.<, Fahr. — Dr. Gill communicatecl 

 the results of certain observations made on Cotluft gnrnlandicits, 

 Fab. {Acanlhocotlus gro'nJand icux^ Girard), duriugthe past season 

 at the island of Grand ]\Ianan, New Brunswick. 



Two forms, agreeing in most respects except color, have been 

 always noticed togetlier Iw those who have been in a position to 

 observe numbers. Tlie most obvious external dillVrence 1)ctwccn 

 these consists in the color, one having tlie flanks downward and 

 the abdomen 3'ellowish, Avhile in the other form the abdomen is 

 spotted with white. Descriptions in several works have been 

 based on onl^^ one of these foims, but in Giinther's " Catalogue of 

 the AcanthopterA'gian Fishes" (II. p. 161), under tlie general 

 term " Cotius girenlandicus,^^ the two forms are mentioned, one 

 bcing"Yar. a. Sides of the l)ell3' with large Avhite spots;" tiie 

 other '• Var. |3. Sides irregularly marbled ;" each was represented 

 in the British Museum b}' four specimens. No suspicion of any 

 sexual relation of those forms was expressed. 



Tlie universal occnrrence of these two forms together and in 

 aiiproximatel}' equal numbers led the speaker to suspect that 

 the^' really represented sexual conditions of the same species. 

 Dissection confirmed the suspicion, and it was found that all in- 

 dividuals with white spots on the abdomen were males, and all 

 without, females. In order to remove doubt, sixteen specimens 

 were dissected, all caught within a cou|)le of hours, at Grand 

 Manan, from the wharf of Mr. Walter ^McLaughlin. 



Six of these had (1) the bell}' ornamented with very distinct 

 white round spots, and (2) the ventral fins were white, banded 

 with black; all these were furnished with spermaries ; (3) the 

 spiny tubercles on the sides were also more numerous, and de- 

 veloped (below as well as above) the lateral line; (4) the spinous 

 dorsal fin was aiiprcciable higher, and (5) several of the nu'dian 

 ra3S (sixth to eleventh) of the pectoral fins were muricated or 

 studded with minute tubercles. 



Of the other form, ten specimens were examined and found 

 with well-developed ovaries (the right larger than the left). Tiiese 

 were (1) yellowish towards the bell}-, and with (2) the vciitral.s 

 yellow, banded with black; (3) the spiny tubercles were, as a 

 rule, less developed, and in one s|)ecimcn sparsely (2-4) existent 

 below the lateral line; (4) the spinous dorsal was comparatively 

 lower, and (5) all the jicctoral rays were perfectly smooth on their 

 inner surfaces. 



The intestinal canal from tlie ca^ca to the anus, when extended, 

 was about twice as long as the entire fish (including the caudal).

There thus appears to be a considerable range of variation in 

 the number of rays. The most common number is represented by 

 the fornnda D. x, 16-17, A. 13, P. 18. The number of pectoral 

 rays, as might a j^riori be expected, is the most constant. 



There seems to be no valid reasons for the distinction of 

 '■'■ AcanthocoUus variabilis,'^ A3a-es,and '-'' Acanthocoitus miicosus,'^ 

 Ayres, from Cotl.us grcenlandicus, and certainly no distinctive 

 characters have been assigned. 



In answer to questions, it was added that no definite relation 

 existed between the numbers of rays of the vertical fins and the 

 number of vertebrae, nor was there any corresponding variation. 

 The most common number of vertebra in fishes 'is ten dorsal and 

 fourteen caudal (10 + 14), but the difference in the number of rays 

 in forms thus distinguished is very considerable.

Mr. Thomas Meehan said he had observed this season that the 

 spawn of the common mushroom {Agaricua campestris) radiated 

 from a central point in a manner which he thought had not been 

 recorded b}^ other observers. As usually seen, the mushroom 

 seemed to rise from various points along the mycelium, or under- 

 ground thread, without any regular order or system. Fungi, like 

 lowering plants, had other modes of propagation besides seeds. 

 As in the potato, we had one sj^stem elevating its parts into the 

 atmosphere ending in seeds, and another sending thready stolons 

 under ground terminating in distended stems or tubers — the 




NATURAL SCIEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 215 



tliveacls dj'ing awa^- after the tubers were mature — so in the com- 

 mon agarics we have the parts known as the " mushroom"' which 

 elevates itself into the atmosphere, and produces reproductive 

 bodies like seeds called spores; and we also have underground 

 white threads starting out from the base of the mushroom wliich 

 at their terminus bear buds which next ^^ear become mushrooms, 

 as the swollen ends or tubers of the potato produce plants. The 

 observations, which he supposed new, referred to the distance 

 which the iijnwn-threads traversed in one season, and the regular 

 manner in wliicli the mushrooms appeared from the parent of the 

 past 3'ear. 



In the autumn of 18T1, passing over a part of his farm where 

 lie had seen no mushrooms in previous 3'ears, he found two soli- 

 tary specimens several yards apart. This season, where these two 

 were gathered last A'ear, there were two exact circles of several 

 dozens of mushrooms, the circles about nine feet in diameter. 

 The mushrooms were wholly confined to a belt of about six inches 

 on the margin of this circle. The diameters in both instances 

 being the same, led to the fair inference that about four feet is 

 the distance travelled in one season b^' the spawn of the mush- 

 room. Of course, next year, when the spawn starts from the l)ases 

 of the mushrooms now in the circle, some will go back over the 

 distance traversed this year, and the appearance of circles will be 

 broken up, and it was owing to the fact of only two appearing in 

 this way, that the radiating character could be observed. 



In England there are fungi which are known to radiate their 

 threads from a common centre in this way. These destroy tiie 

 vegetation which they come in contact with on their route, and 

 make brown circular spots known to the common people as Fairy 

 rings. The grass and vegetation inclosed in the mushroom rings 

 were not destroj'ed as in those instances, but exhibited a slight 

 bluish tint which that beyond the circle did not, which tint was 

 a sign of slight injury. Tiie facts that the mycelium radiated in 

 so exact a circle, terminating in a bud which produced tlu' mush- 

 room ; and that this radiation covered a circle nine feet in diame- 

 ter, he thought novel facts worth recording.

This interesting shell was sent to the Academy b}'' Dr. Yarrow, 

 from Fort Macon. I suppose it to be a recent shell, on account 

 of its polish, and part of the unaltered ligament remaining. Two 

 specimens were found. It is the onl^^ recent species of Glycimeris

 in the Miocene of Virginia and North Carolina. The genus

Remarks on the Habits of an Ant. — Prof. Leidy remarked that 

 in his recent visit to Fort Bridger, Wyoming, in man^^ places he 

 observed the nests or hills of an ant, which reminded him of a 

 communication formerly made to the Academy by Mr. Lincecum, 

 on the Agricultural Ant of Texas (1866, 323). The ant-hills con- 

 sisted of conical piles of gravel from one to two feet in diameter 

 and from six inches to a foot in height, occupying the centre of a 

 bare, circular level several yards in diameter. The mode of for- 

 mation and object of the circular space were not ascertained. 

 Probably it was the accidental result of the insect feeding on all 

 kinds of vegetation growing within a circumscribed limit. Mr. 

 Lincecum described similar circles, or pavements as he calls them, 

 and stated that the ants allow nothing to grow upon them except- 

 ing a certain grass, Aristida stricta, from which they collect the 

 seeds when ripe.

Remarks on llineral Springs,, (&c., of Wyoming and Utah. — 

 Prof. Leidy observed that, in his recent trip to Wj^oming and 

 Utah, he had had the opportunity of seeing a few of the mineral 

 springs which are so numerous and varied in character, west of 

 the Pvocky Mountains. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 219 



In Pioneer Hollow, about fourteen miles west of Fort Lridger, 

 and a couple of miles from the Union Pacific Railroad, tlierc are 

 about a dozen springs within the extent of a mile. These resemble 

 the famous Saratoga Springs of New York. The waters are cool, 

 slightly alkaline, of an agreeable taste, and highly impregnated 

 with carbonic acid. The springs range from a foot to fifteen feet 

 in diameter. Each forms a circular mound or crater from one to 

 three or four feet in height composed of a ferruginous silicious 

 sinter. The waters pour gentl}- over the edge of the craters, 

 which have been deposited very slowly during a long period of 

 time, as the amount of silcx in solution in the water is probably 

 exceedingly' small. Abundance of a green filamentous alga grows 

 in the springs, apparently a species of oscillatoria. No animal 

 forms were detected in them. The rocks contiguous to Pioneer 

 hollow consist of reddish and yellow indurated clays and sand- 

 stones, in nearly horizontal strata. I detected no fossils in them, 

 but suspect from their contiguit}' that they are of tertiary ago. 



About twent3'-two miles from Fort Dridger, in tlie same direc- 

 tion as the former, there is an oil spring, the product of which 

 resembles the so-called lubricating oil. Judge Carter is making 

 the experiment of boring to render tlie spring more productive. 

 The neighboring rocks are highlj' inclined, and probably are of 

 cretaceous age. 



A mile or two north of Salt Lake Cit}' there is a warm spring 

 with which a sanitary estaljlishmcnt is connected. The water is 

 strongly saline and is impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen. 

 Its temperature I found, with an ordinary thermometer, to be \)S^^. 

 A mile or two further north, on the Utah Central Railroad, there 

 is a similar spring with a higher temperature, which I found to be 

 128°. The water gushes forth abundantly from beneath a rock 

 and forms a clear pond, with the bottom covered with a bright- 

 green alga. This a})pears also to be an oscillatoria. Masses of 

 it fioating near the edge of the pond were white on the ui)per or 

 exposed surface. This I suspected to be due to free sulphur, and 

 indeed when the alga was exposeil to the flame of a spirit-lamp it 

 gave out an indistinct odor of sulphur, though the result was not 

 so marked as I had anticipated. The water is strongly saline to 

 the taste and is impregnated with sulphuretted hytlrogen. No 

 animals were detected in the water — not even microscopic forms. 

 The waters of these springs finally' pour into Salt Lake. 



Salt Ijake, as is well known, is remarkable, like the Dead Sea, 

 for the concentrated condition of its briny water, due to the accu- 

 mulation of the saline matters by the evai)oration of the water 

 which has no river outlet. The many salt springs which empty 

 in the lake must have greatly conlriliuted to the aecnniulation of 

 the saline constituents. The water of the lake is intensi-ly salt to 

 the taste, and is said to contain a fifth of its weiglit of salt. This, 

 as well as some other points, 1 iiave not l)een able to test, from my 




220 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



collections not 3'et having arrived. Tlie much greater extent of 

 the Lake in former times is apparently confirmed b}^ the ancient 

 shore lines seen high np on the sides of the neighboring moun- 

 tains. Two of these ancient shore lines, at different heights, pre- 

 serve their horizontalit}- and parallel character for miles along the 

 base of the Wasatch Mountains, and form a quite conspicuous 

 feature of the landscape of Salt Lake Valley. They reminded me 

 of the view given in Lyell's Antiquity of Man, of the parallel 

 roads of Glen Roy in Scotland. On ascending to these ledges, 

 behind the position of Camp Douglas, I found that they were 

 hardly recognizable, and the description of the roads just men- 

 tioned applies to tliem so closely that it may be suspected they 

 may have had the same mode of origin. I was informed that 

 similar ancient shore lines are visible on the sides of the mountain 

 islands of the lake. 



Salt Lake is usually' considered to be destitute of animal and 

 vegetable life. Through the kindness of General H. A. MorroAv, 

 in command of Camp Douglas, I was enabled to visit the south- 

 west shore of the lake. I observed a number of water-birds on its 

 surface, among which were gulls and teal, and on the shore I 

 noticed several curlew. Other birds, especially pellicans, were 

 said to be abundant. These birds lead me to suspect the exist- 

 ence of fishes in the lake, though none have yet been noticed. I 

 observed no peculiar aquatic plants growing at the border of the 

 lake, and indeed the part of the shore I visited was entirelj' desti- 

 tute of vegetation within reach of the water. The shore swarmed 

 with a small black fly, which from the vast quantities of larva 

 skins h'ing near, I supposed to have been derived from the lake. 

 Never before did I see such a vast accumulation of any one species 

 of animal. The flies formed thick rows near the water's edge like 

 windrows of ha}', and the bushes bordering the shore were loaded 

 with them in such a manner as to remind one of swarms of black 

 aphides. In walking along shore the}^ rose before you in dense 

 black clouds. So far as I could discover, the gulls and curlews 

 appeared to be feeding on them. The remarkable crustacean Ar- 

 temia salina has been abundantly found in the lake, as before 

 indicated in this Academy. {Proc. p. 164.) 



I also observed floating at the edge of the lake and thrown on 

 shore an abundance of an alga, apparently a species of Nostoc. 

 It was in irregularly globular masses, from the size of mustard- 

 seed to that of a large pea, and was of an olive-green color.

ON THE AGENCY OF INSECTS IN OBSTRUCTING EVOLUTION. 

 BY THOMAS MEEHAN. 



Since so much which has been learned in regard to the agency 

 of insects in the cross fertilization of flowers, I understand the 

 drift of scientific thought to be in the direction of .the general 

 principle, that in the h3^pothesis of evolution insects pla}' an im- 

 portant i^art. It does not seem to have occurred to an}' observer 

 that they may act as an obstruction to any great departure from 

 what we may take as the normal form — that but for them varia- 

 tions would probably often be much greater than they are. 



It has fallen to m}^ lot to observe and to place on record in the 

 Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 

 the American Naturalist, and elsewhere, that art has not so much 

 to do with garden variations as gcnei'ally supposed ; that varia- 

 tions in nature are as great as in horticulture; and that tlie 

 florist's credit is chiefly due in preserving the form which un- 

 assisted nature provided for him. It was at one time part of the 

 essential idea of a species that it would reproduce itself. If any 

 variation occurred in nature, it was taken for granted that seed- 

 lings from this variation would revert to the parent form. But it 

 is now known that the most marked peculiarit}' in variation can 

 be reproduced in the progeny, if care be taken to provide against 

 fertilization by another form. Thus, the blood-leaved variet}' of the 

 English beeeli will produce blood-leaved beeches; and, as I Iiave 

 myself found by experiment, the very pendulous weeping peach 

 produces from seed plants as full}' ciiaracterlstic as its parent ; 

 and when the double blossomed peaches bear fruit, as they some- 

 times do, I have it on the authority of a careful friend that the 

 progeny is doubled as its parent was. But I need not refer 

 particularly' to this. Any intelligent florist of the pi'csent age 

 can testifj' to the fact, that varieties will reproduce themselves as 

 fully as the original forms from whence they sprung. 



I do not think botanists, as such, are so fully aware of these 

 facts as the florists are. They scarcely admit of mucli inherent 

 variation in form in nature ; l)ut look rather to liybridization, and 

 insect agency in connection therewith, to account for tiie changes 

 when they occur. In order to avoid the possiliiiity of these 

 agencies acting as the sole factors in evolution, 1 liave generally 




236 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



taken a genus consisting of only one species in a given locality, to 

 show how great is the variations in form, where no congenital 

 species could mix with it. I have, for this, chosen Epigsea repena^ 

 Chrysanthemum leucanthevium, and the Quercus neo-mexicana ( Q. 

 Gminissonii?) of the Rocky Mountains — papers which most of 

 the readers of this will probably remember. Another familiar 

 plant to illustrate this is the common yellow toad flax, Linaria 

 vulgaris. In a handful of specimens gathered in an afternoon's 

 walk, I find the following marked variations : — 



In regard to the spur, which is generally as long as the main 

 portion of the corolla, some have them only one-third or one-fourth 

 as long; and in one instance the plant bears flowers entirely 

 sjyurless. Dr. James Darrach, a member of the Academy, informs 

 me that he believes he has, in years past, gathered a spurless form, 

 but has neglected to place it on record. Then some plants bear 

 flowers with spurs thick, and others with narrow ones ; and while 

 some have spurs quite straight, others curve so as to describe 

 nearly the half of a circle. The lobing of the lower lip is various. 

 In some cases the two lateral ones spread away from the small 

 central one, leaving a free space all around it ; at other times they 

 overlap the central one so that it is scarcely seen. Sometimes the 

 small central lobe is nearly wanting — often not more than half 

 the depth of the two large lobes, and at times quite as full, 

 when it may be linear, ovate, or nearly orbicular. The palate, 

 as the deep colored process attached to the lower lip m^y be 

 called, also varies. In color it is pale lemon, but often a brilliant 

 orange. Sometimes it is but about the eighth of an inch in 

 thickness ; at others one-fourth, in flowers of the same size. In 

 the case of the shallow flat palate, the attached lobes are patent, 

 or even incurved ; while in the thick ones they are very much 

 reflexed. These two forms, when the extremes are selected, are 

 as strikingly distinct as two species often are. Again, the palate 

 is rounded and blunt at the apex ; at other times almost wedge- 

 shaped, or at least narrowing to a blunt point. The upper lip 

 varies in proportionate length, sometimes not extending much 

 beyond the palate, sometimes half an inch more ; then the 

 margins are sometimes bent down like the wings of a swooping 

 bird ; or upwards as in those of a rapidly descending one. Some- 

 times they are united and turned abruptly up at the apex, like 

 the keel of the garden pea. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 237 



Anrl now in regard to the hearing of all these facts on the great 

 scientific questions of the da}', we have to note first, that the 

 plant is an introduced weed, with nothing allied to it anywhere, 

 in the localities where we usually find it, with which it can 

 possibly hybridize. The variations must be from some natural 

 law of evolution inherent in the plant itself. Varieties of course 

 ma}- cross-fertilize as well as species ; and some of these varia- 

 tions may be owing to one form fertilizing another form ; but 

 there can be no avoiding the fact, that at least the first pair of 

 var3'ing forms must have originated by simple evolution. 



Now going back to our florists' experience the question occurs, 

 that as varieties once evolved will reproduce themselves from 

 seed, whj' does not some one of these Linarias, which has been 

 struck oflT into some distinct mould, reproduce itself from seed, 

 and establish, in a state of nature, a new race, as it would do under 

 tlie florist's care ? Why, for instance, is there not a spurless race? 

 It is scarcely probable that the solitary plant, found on this after- 

 noon's walk, is the onlj' one ever produced. Dr. Darrach's 

 recollection shows it is not a solitary case. The bumblebee 

 furnishes the answer. They, so far as I have been able to see, 

 are the only insects which visit these flowers. They seem very 

 fond of them, and enter regularly at the mouth, and stretch down 

 deep into the spur for the sweets gathered there. The pollen 

 is collected on the thorax, and of course is carried to the next 

 flower. The florist, to " fix" the form, carefull}' isolates the plant • 

 but in the wild state a spurless form has no chance. The bee 

 from the neighboring flower of course fertilizing it wilh the 

 pollen from any of the otiier forms. 



If there were no bees, no agency whatever for cross fertilization, 

 nothing but the plant's own pollen to depend on, there would 

 undoubtedly be races of this linaria, which, again, by natural 

 evolution at times changing, would produce other races ; and in 

 time the difference might be as great as to be even though 

 generic. lUit we see that by the agency of the liuniblebee the 

 progress of the newl}' evolved form is checked. The pollen of 

 the original form is again introduced to the ofl'spring, ami it is 

 brought back at least half a degree to its starting point. 



The conclusion seems to me inevitalde, that insects in their 

 fertilizing agencies, arc not always al)ettors, but rather at times 

 conservators of advancing evolution.

Notice of a Corundum Mine. — Prof. Leidy remarked that he 

 had visited a corundum mine recently opened on the farm of Mr. 

 George Ball, in the vicinity of Unionville, Chester Co., Pa. The 

 accumulation is perhaps the most extraordinary discovered, and 

 its extent yet remains unknown. Detached crystals of corundum 

 have often been found in the ploughed fields and roadsides of the 

 neighborhood, and also masses or boulders of the same material 

 have been discovered on the surface of the ground or buried in 

 the local drift covering the deeper rocks. In several instances 

 boulders of nearly pure corundum have been found in the locality 

 up to several tons in weight. A company was led to seek for this 

 important mineral, and for the purpose sunk a shaft in a neighbor- 

 ing hill of albite, but without success. Mr. John Smedley, an in- 

 telligent farmer, employed by the proprietors of the mine, was led 

 to the discovery of the corundum by noticing the direction of the 

 boulders in the surface drift. Tracing it to the top of the hill, he 

 found it about five feet below the surface. 



The corundum, as exposed to view at the bottom of a trench, 

 appears as the crest of a large body or vein lying between a de- 

 composing gneiss and a white talcose schist. The A^ein appears to 

 extend in a western direction and towards the east turns at an 

 obtuse angle to the northeast. The exposed portion ma}" prob- 

 ably reach twenty or more feet and averages about six feet in 

 depth and fl,ve feet in thickness at bottom, and is estimated to 

 contain about fifty tons. How much further the vein extends 

 • west and northeast, and how far it I'eaches in depth and thickness, 

 can only be determined by future mining. It looks as if it pro- 

 mised to be the most valuable deposit of corundum ever found. 



The rock on the south side of the vein is the white talcose 

 schist above mentioned. In immediate contact with the corundum 

 it appeavs to be metamorphosed into the material described a few 

 years ago by our fellow member, Mr. Lea, under the name of 

 Lesleyite, The schist on the declivity of the hill is contiguous to 

 steatite and serpentine. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 239 



The corundum is the pure material, and is not emerj'. The 

 masses are made up of a close aggregation of crystals with the 

 intervals occupied with margarite. Some of the fissures and sur- 

 faces of the masses display large and beautiful cr3'stalline plates 

 of margarite, and occasionally unusally fine crj'stals of diaspore. 

 Some of the crystals of corundum appear to have undergone par- 

 tial metamorphosis into margaiite. The corundum is bluish-gray, 

 of very compact texture, and does not cleave so readily as the 

 North Carolina mineral. 



The various specimens of corundum and other minerals found 

 in association with it, presented to the Academy this evening by 

 Mr. Ball, were obtained at the locality described. 



October 8. 

 The President, Dr. Ruschenberqer, in the chair. 

 Seventeen members present. 



Mr. Thomas Meehan remarked, that as botanists well knew. 

 Quercus prinoides seldom grew more than two feet in height. It 

 was one of the smallest of shrubs. In his collections in Kansas, 

 he found oaks in the vicinity of Leavenworth, which made small 

 trees from ten to fifteen feet high, and with stems from one to two 

 feet in circumference. He was entirely satisfied that it is identical 

 in every respect but size with the Q. jjrinoides of the eastern 

 States. 



Among trees there are few which produce forms as low shrubs; 

 but the Pinus Bankfiiana, in the East but a bush of five or ten feet, 

 grew often fort^' feet along tiie shores of Lake Superior ; the Cas- 

 tanea pumila^ Chinquapin chestnut, when it gets out of the sands of 

 Kew Jersey into the elaye}' soils west of the Delaware, often grew 

 as large as many full grown apple trees; while the Cclfis occuien- 

 (alis, which in the East is generally but a straggling bush along 

 fence corners, is in Ohio a large spreading tree with enormous 

 trunk, and in Indiana is as lofty and as graceful as an elm. 



He also exhibited a section of a stem of n7.s7fl?-/a .sinensis, and 

 • called the attention of members to a curious arrangement of the 

 wood and bark. The vertical section showed by the annual rings 

 of wood that it was about twelve years old. After the cighlh 

 year's circle there was a laj'er of bark, and over this layer two 

 more circles of wood. On a portion of the section another layer 

 of bark iiad formed between tiie tenth and eleventh years' circles 

 of wood. The bark seemetl to be wholly of liber, tlie cellular 

 matter and external cortical-layer of the regular hark appeared to 

 l)e wanting. A longitudinal section showed wher(! these iiilernnl 

 laj-ers of bark extendetl no further upwards, and al this point there 




240 TROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



was an evident flow of wood from the interior over and down this 

 laj-er of inclosed bark. 



He remarked that this section of wood was taken from a stem 

 which had been led to support itself in an upright position. When 

 the Wistaria is permitted to trail along the ground numerous 

 rootlets are formed along its length. He thought from the appear- 

 ance of the wood, in the specimen presented, that rootlets had 

 partially formed in these erect stems, pushing through the liber, 

 and then instead of penetrating entirely through the bark, and 

 forming perfect rootlets, the}^ remained within the cellular matter, 

 and descending joined with the regular woody layer in forming 

 an annular course of wood. This explanation was the more 

 plausible, he thought, from the fact that woody stems formed on 

 the ground. Where the rootlets went quite through into the earth, 

 the stems were nearly regularly cylindrical ; but these upright 

 stems on which rootlets w^ere never seen had an irregular fluted 

 appearance; of course, this explanation does not accord with the 

 formation of wood in ligneous structures as generally understood ; 

 but he could not understand how the appearance presented could 

 have occurred in any other way, than as he had supposed. 



Attention was called to a twin aj^ple, on the table, with two stems 

 and stem cavities, and two calj^x basins a little below which, how- 

 ever, an union had taken place. Mr. Meehan said these phenomena 

 were rather common with various fruits and the mode of produc- 

 tion well understood. It was simply the inarching of two fruits 

 ■at a verj' early stage of their existence, through two embryonic 

 blossoms having perhaps been produced in juxtaposition from one 

 bud. 



Dr. Joseph Carson said that he thought the varietj'' exhibited, 

 the wiuesap, had a tendency to pair 3'Oung buds and thus bring 

 forth these united twin fruit. He had once known a tree of them 

 which produced a large proportion of the fruit of this character. 

 He had seen perhaps a peck of them which had been gathered at 

 one time from the tree.

RemcD'ks on Fossil Mammals from Wyoming. — Prof. Leidy di- 

 rected attention to the collection of fossils, from the vicinity of 

 Fort Bridger, Wyoming, presented this evening bj^ Dr. J. Van 

 A. Carter, Dr. Joseph K. Corson, U. S. A., and himself. Among 

 them are the more characteristic remains noticed in a letter sent 

 by him to the Academy last July, published August 1st, and sub- 

 sequently in the Proceedings, page 167. Some of the fossils were 




NATURAL SCIEN'CES OF PHILADELPHIA. 241 



referred to a huge pachyderm with the name of Uintatherium 

 ROBUSTUM. Of this animal Drs. Carter and Corson found together 

 a number of parts of the same skeleton, consisting of the back 

 portion of a cranium retaining parts of both temporal fossse, the 

 occiput and the occipital condyles; parts of the upper and lower 

 jaws containing the back molars ; a mutilated humerus ; a proximal 

 and a distal extremity of a femur ; and a calcaneum and an astra- 

 galus. These were found 10 miles from Prj' Creek Canon, about 

 50 miles from Fort Bridger. In Dry Creek Canon Prof Leidy 

 found a mutilated atlas and the body of an axis, evidently of the 

 same animah 



Ten miles distant from the locality in which the former remains of 

 Uintnlherium were found. Dr. Corson discovered the hxi-ge canines, 

 originally referred to Uintamastix atrox. "While it was -suspected 

 that the}' might pertain to Uintatherium, no evidence was found 

 to sustain the opinion, and from their resemblance to the canines 

 of the great Brazilian sabre-tootlied tiger MachaiJ'odus, thej' were 

 referred to a carnivore with the name just stated. 



Prof. Marsh has since published a notice, dated Sept. 27th and 

 appearing in the October number of the American Journal of 

 Science, of a skull from Wyoming, under the name of Dinoceraa 

 mirabilis^ which appears to be the same as Uintatherium robustum. 

 The skull he observes is entire and is 2Si inches long. It is pro- 

 vided with three pairs of horn cores and huge decurved canine 

 tusks. The top of the skull is deeply concave and has around its 

 lateral and posterior margins an enormous crest. This description 

 will apply to our cranium, as does also that of the molar teeth to 

 those in our upper jaw specimens. The description of the canines 

 equally well applies to those referred to Uititamasfix alrox, so 

 that it would appear that this and Dinoceras mirabilis are the 

 same as Uinlalherium robustum. 



Some of the fossils belong to PaLjEOsyops major, a large tapir- 

 like animal. Of this we have a number of line specimens, including 

 a cranium, the face and parts of the jaws of a second individual, 

 and several rami of lower jaws with well preserved teeth of others. 

 These were discovered b}' Drs, Carter and Corson in Dry Creek 

 Cafion. The genus was originally noticed in the Proceedings of 

 this Academy for 1870. It was founded on a few teeth and was 

 supposed to be an even-toed pachyderm. From more coniph'lc 

 material its true position as an ochl-toed pachyderm was recog- 

 nized, and its characters more fully given in Prof Hayden's Pre- 

 liminary Ileport of the C S. Geological Survey of Montana, etc., 

 published in the l)eginning of this year. The last August, i'rof 

 Marsh pul)lished a notice, in the American .lournal of Science, 

 of some fossils from W3'oming wliicli he ascribes to two genera 

 under the name of J'(ilfi'()si/o])ft and Liiiniohi/us. From the notice 

 it would appear he has overlooked the description of J'alarosi/o]>s 

 in the Report just named, for he intimates the reference of the 

 genus to the perissodactyls as if i)reviously unknown and sug- 




242 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



gests the reference to it of specimens in which the " last upper 

 molar has two inner cones," though it is distinctly stated in the 

 above Report that " the last upper molar of Falseosi/ops has but a 

 single lobe to the inner part of the crown." Upon the latter char- 

 acter Prof. Marsh proposed the genus Limnohyus, which, under the 

 circumstances is untenable, but might with propriety be applied 

 to the animal with molars like those of Paleeosyops^ except that 

 the last upper one has two inner cones to the crown. In this view, 

 a specimen in the collection, of a last upper molar tooth, which I 

 had ascribed to Palseosyojos humilis on account of its comparatively 

 small size, would belong to Limnohyus. 



Beviarks on Chipped Stones from Wyoming. — Prof. Leidy 

 further called attention to a multitude of chipped stones, which 

 he had collected about 10 miles northeast of Fort Bridger. He 

 observed that he had noticed in manj^ places in the vicinity of 

 Fort Bridger, covering the plains and ravines at the base of the 

 foot hills of the Uintas, great quantities of sharpl}"^ fractured stone 

 fragments. They are frequently mingled with the rounded peb- 

 bles of the drift from the Uintas, but in other places are thickly 

 strewn over the ground without being mingled with the drift. 

 Man}'^ of the fragraeuts are broken in such a manner that it is 

 difficult to be convinced that they are not of artificial origin. 

 Mingled with the more evident accidental flakes there occur great 

 numbers of stone implements of the rudest construction, such as 

 those exhibited on the table. A few are also found of the finest 

 finish. Between these and the stone spawls of accidental origin 

 there occurs such a gradation of form as to render it doubtful at 

 times when nature ceased her labor and where primitive man com- 

 menced with his. 



The materials of the splintered stones consist of jaspers, quart- 

 zites, some of the softer rocks of the tertiary strata, and less fre- 

 quently of black flint, identical in appearance with that of the Eng- 

 lish chalk. The latter material I nowhere found in position, but 

 have been informed by Prof. Haydeu that it occurs in the cliffs of 

 Henry's Fork of Green River. 



The accidental flakes probably had their origin through the 

 agency of frosts, and from the concussion of stones descending 

 from the declivities. In experimenting on some weather-worn 

 slabs of jasper from the buttes of Dry Creek, I found that mode- 

 rate blows of a hammer would send off sharp spawls, reminding 

 one of the ancient flint knives. 



The splintered stones appear greatly to diflTer in age; while some 

 appear perfectly fresh as if recently broken from the parent block, 

 others are dull and worn, and many so deeply altered bj^ exposure 

 as to look very ancient. In some of the old looking specimens, 

 the jasper originally black or brown has become whitened to the 

 depth of half an inch or more. 



Prof. Leidy further remarked as follows : — I may take this op- 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 243 



portunit}^ of referring to one of the simplest of stone implements 

 yet in use among the Indians of W^'oniing. During my stay at 

 Fort Bridger the Slioshones made a visit to the post, and en- 

 camped on Black's Fork in its vicinit}' for a week. They comjirised 

 about 800 persons with about 80 lodges and 1 000 horses. Being the 

 first time I had had a chance of seeing a tribe of Indians, I felt 

 much interest in observing them. While wandering through their 

 camp I noticed the women engaged in dressing buffalo skins with 

 a stone implement, the onl}- one of the material I discovered in 

 use among them. It was a thin segment from a quartzite boulder, 

 made b}^ a single smart blow with another stone and with no other 

 preparation. Several specimens I exhibit to the Academy, ob- 

 ■ tained by m}' friend Dr. Carter, who ascertained that tiie instru- 

 ment was called a Te-sho-a. By an accident I learned that it was 

 not a recent instrument incidental to the i)lace and circumstances. 

 While on an excursion after fossils, I noticed on the side of a 

 butte some weathered human bones, which had fallen from a grave 

 above. With them I found some perforated tusks of the elk and 

 one of the stone teshoa. As the grave was an old one, which had 

 become exposed by the wearing away of the edge of the butte, it 

 made it probable that the teshoa did not belong alone to the 

 present generation. 



The tusks of the elk are used by the Shoshones as ornamental 

 trophies. They form another evidence of the early relationship of 

 man, as I observe in a recent number of the American Journnl of 

 Science, that similar ornaments were found together with Hint 

 knives, in association with a human skeleton, in a cavern uf 

 Brousse-rousse, iu Italy. 



Bemarks on the Action of Wind and Sand on /ioc/x. — I'rof. 

 Leidy then directed attention to some specimens of quartzite and 

 jasper, which he observed illustrated the eroding and p(jlisliing 

 eti'ect of the conjoint action of wind and sand. They were coUecteiJ 

 b}' him from one of the buttes of Wyoming. In some situations tiie 

 stones, firmly imbedded in the hard clay of the buttes, and exposed 

 to an almost incessant action of winds and sand, are all much 

 worn and highly polished. He remarked that many of the sand- 

 stone cliffs and other rocks of the West, which were supposed to 

 owe their eroded, cavernous, and often fantastic appearance to the 

 action of water, he thought was largely due to the conjoined 

 action of winds and sands.

' I think that a considerable reduction ot' sjiecies is neressnry in this 

 genus ; but, unfortunntely, I liave not enough specimens at hand to ninkc 

 satisfactory comparisons. The species appear to vary so much in form, 

 sculpture, and color, that identification, in many cases, is entirely arbi- 

 tniry.

NOTES ON THE GENUS POLORTHUS, Gabb. 

 BY WILLIAM M. GABB, 



In 1834, Dr. S. G. Morton, in his " Sj-nopsis of the Oriranic 

 Remains of the Cretaceous Group of the United States," described 

 a species under the name of Teredo tibialis ; mentioning a former 

 edition of the same work, when he saj's he " referred this species 

 to T.antenanlas, Sby." {Min.Conch., vol. i. p. 231, pi. 102). Sow- 

 erby's shell is from the London clay, and ^Morton was correct in 

 separating the American species, which is Cretaceous. But while 

 correcting one error he fell into two others, not less grave. He 

 included all of the terediform tubes found in New Jersc3' under 

 the one name, and figured as the type of the species a shell which 

 1 believe is not only not a Teredo, but is Cejihalopod. There 

 are at least two species mentioned by Morton (Syn. Crel., p. 69) ; 

 and for the one figured and described, the specific name must be 

 retained. For the other I proposed the name of T. irrerjularis 

 in 1860 {Jour. Philad. Acad., 2d ser. vol. iv. p. 30.3, pi. 68, fig. !*>)• 



In 1861, while examining Dr. Morton's specimens, I was struck 

 bj- some peculiarities in the tubes, which, on further stud>-, in- 

 duced me to propose the above generic name, and suggest the 

 lelationship of the genus to Vermetus. Since then tiic matter 

 seems to have been forgotten, until recently my friend. Dr. 

 Stoliczka, in his able work on the Fossils of India (Pal. Indira, 

 vol. iii. p. 14), quotes the name doubtfully and at second hand for 

 the Smithsonian Check List, and in the PhnJadida\ This last 

 fact has determined me to call attention to the genus in a inoie 

 explicit manner than the original imperfect notice, in the Tro- 

 ceedings of the Academy, 1801, p. 360. 



P. tibialis, Morton, is the species for which the name was first 

 proposed. At the time I described the genus, I was in receipt of 

 a fine series of specimens of my Ga.stroclixna Americana, from 

 the "Ripley Group" of Tennessee, sent me by Prof. Sallbrd, the 

 State Geologist, and I found tliat the two forms were congeneric, 

 although I have never yet seen the apex of tlie latter species. 



The generic characters are as follows: Shell tubular, growing 

 singly or in clusters, nearly straight. Interior divided into cham- 

 bers by two entirely dilferent sets of septa. In the young state, 




260 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



the septa are cup-shaped, as in Orthoceras^ but, unlike that genus, 

 they are not perforated by a small siphonal opening. Instead, 

 the middle of each septum is prolonged into a tapering tube with 

 an elliptical cross section, the apex of which tube enters the base 

 and nearly, or completely, fills the interior of its predecessor. 

 Extreme apex unknown. In the space immediately succeeding 

 the last septum, there is a saddle-shaped, continuous muscular (?) 

 scar, which rises on the sides corresponding with the broad part 

 of the funnel -like siphonal tubes, and is deeply depressed on the 

 sides corresponding with the ends of the ellipse.- Beyond this 

 stage, the shell continues as a nearly straight tube, increasing 

 xevy slowl}^ in diameter and, at irregular intervals, is hermetically 

 closed by convex septa, having their convex face reversed ; that 

 is to say, placed tow^ards the broader, or newer portion of the 

 tube. The structure is microscopically prismatic, the prisms being 

 placed transversel}" as in Inoceravms. Both the walls and the 

 septa are made up of numerous layers of shell substance, no struc- 

 tural difference existing between the several parts. 



P. tibialis grows in masses of tubes bearing a strong superficial 

 resemblance to Teredo, which resemblance misled Dr. Morton in 

 his generic reference. But, even apart from its internal structure, 

 the analogy fails, since it never occurs perforating wood or other 

 hard substances. The spaces between the shells are filled only 

 with sand. This free mode of growth, and my not being ac- 

 quainted at the time with the peculiar characters of the apical 

 portion, induced me to refer my genus to the Vermetidse on ac- 

 count of the septa in the larger portions of the tulae; a character 

 not unlike that of Vermetus and Csecum. Latterly, through the 

 kindness of my friend. Dr. Joseph Leid}'^, I have been enabled to 

 study better specimens than any heretofore examined, and thus 

 discovered the anomalous character of the young shell. 



P. Americanus seems to be solitary in its habits ; at least, no 

 masses of this species have ever been obtained. In external form 

 it is not unlike the tube of Gastrochaena, and I thus described it 

 at first. The Tennessee specimens, preserved in a soft matrix, 

 show that internally it has the same imperforate septa, convex 

 towards the broader end of the tube, and placed at irregular dis- 

 tances. 



The structure of the j^oung shell places this genus, as the tj'pe 

 of a new family, PoLORTHiDiE, among the Cephalopods^ and it only 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PUILADELnilA. 261 



remains to determine ■what are its nearest relations. Its simple- 

 edged septa confine it to the group, of which the modern Xautilus 

 may be taken as a type. But the complex nature of its septa has 

 no analogy among the modern genera, even geologically- speaking. 

 We must look for its relations among the paloeozoic forms, such as 

 Endoceras, Actinoceras, and more especially Beatricea. In fact, 

 it seems in some respects to be intermediate between the last, as 

 described by Hyatt^ and the two former ; and again to connect 

 both groups with the Oi'thoceridae proper. In Orthoceras we have 

 direct communication from one chamber to the next. In Endo- 

 ceras, Actinoceras, and the allied genera, the position of the siphon 

 is occupied bj' a shelly tube which seem.s to have allowed no such 

 communication bc^-ond its own walls. In Beatricea the central 

 column is described as consisting of a chain of small hollow 

 chambers, not continuous either with each other or with the en- 

 circling chambers. In Polortlius, unlike Orthoceras, the tubes 

 are not membranous, but shelly. The}'' can be compared in their 

 enveloping character to the column of Beatricea, of which Hyatt 

 says, "the central chambers are imperforate, generally deeply 

 concave, and set upon one another like a pile of Chinese teacups." 

 By elongating these " teacups" into a series of laterall}' com- 

 pressed cones, we have the column of Polorlhus, with the dift'er- 

 ence that in the latter each cone is soldered to, or more properly, 

 is a continuation of one of the outer septa. The nature of the 

 matrix is such that I have not been able to demonstrate, be^'ond 

 a doubt, the character of the apex of these cones, but I believe it 

 to have been perforated by a minute slit; a fact which would con- 

 nect Beatricea with Endoceras. On the other hand, while the 

 base of each cone, where it leaves the transverse septum, is appa- 

 rently closed complete!}' by the next cone fitting tightly into it; 

 there is at least a rudimentary, if not a real connection between 

 the outer chamber and the interior of the column, thus sliowing a 

 nearer connection betwecii Folorl/ius a.ud Orthoccm.^ ih.in ])ct\v(i'ii 

 the latter and the other two quoted genera. 



The muscular scar visible on the casts of tlie intciior jusL al)ovc 

 the last of the sepLa is not without its analogy. I have found 

 such impressions in all the modern species of Nautilus, hut more 

 especially in N. pompilius,^ where it consists of two broad scars

like those of an oyster, connected b}' a faint polished line, marking 

 the mantle margin. 



Having pointed out what I believe to be the relations of this 

 remarkable fossil, it yet remains for me to remai'k on the anoma- 

 lous circumstances connected with the manner of growth of the 

 shell in its later stages. 



After growing to a length of nearly an inch, the animals (at 

 least of P. tibialis) seem to have congregated into colonies. 

 Thenceforward the septate character, above described, ceases. 

 The tube increases gradually in diameter as it grows in length, 

 and at distances varying without any determinate sj^stem, from a 

 quarter of an inch to two inches apart, the tube is hermetically 

 closed b}' arched septa, with their convex faces towards the mouth 

 of the tube ; or in a reversed position to that of the primary 

 series. The tube consequenth^ could have been of no further use 

 as a float, like that of the other chambered cephalopods, and 

 would have been really disadvantageous to its occupant, was it 

 not permanently anchored as we see it actuall}'- was. The colonies 

 must consequentl}^ have resembled a highly magnified view of a 

 brj'ozoon or a coral.

NOTICE OF A COLLECTION OF CRETACEOUS FOSSILS FEOM CHIHUAHUA, 



MEXICO. 



BY WILLIAM M. GABB. 



A SMALL collection of Cretaceous fossils has recently been sub- 

 mitted to me for examination by my friend, Dr. J. P. Kimball, 

 who collected them near the centre of the State of Chihuahua, at 

 a place called Nugal, in the midst of a silver mining region. In 

 fact, the doctor represents the argentiferous veins as lying in the 

 cretaceous limestone.* 



The fossils are of the more interest, since the}^ are another link 

 in the chain of evidence, to prove an extension of the cretaceous 

 sea completely across Northern Mexico." The}' are of the same 

 *group, from which I have alrcad}' described one series, collected 

 by my old friend and colleague, Aug. Remond, at AriA'cchi in 

 Sonora ; and the two localities are only separated b}'- the crest of 

 the Sierra Madre, which probabl}^ showed its summits as a string 

 of islands in the ancient ocean. 



Collected incidentall}' during a journey made for an entirel}' 

 diflerent purpose, and in a region infested by Apaches, it is not 

 strange that the series is meagre. Fortunatclj', it is full enough 

 to give us an undoubted key to the exact meml)er of the forma- 

 tion. 



The following is a list of the species identified. In addition to 

 these, there is a. /avosilifu7-m coral, and one or two otiier forms 

 too imperfect for recognition.

Roemer's figure represents a larger specimen than the one be- 

 fore me, and one which exhibits only the more mature form of the 

 shell. The present fine example is 4.T inches in its greater dia- 

 meter, and gives us some additional characters. It wants almost 

 entirely the dorsal ornamentation figured in Kreid. Texas ; the 

 dorsum being broad, nearly flat, and rounded on the margin. The' 

 umbilical row of nodes is well developed, but the outer lateral row 

 is barely discernible ; their place being occupied, on the older 

 parts or the shell by faint undulations, which show a tendency to 

 form a series of bifurcate ribs extending outward from the above- 

 mentioned nodes. In the still younger stage, as exhibited by the 

 inner whorls, the shell is flattened discoidal, very similar to A. 

 placenta or A. Pedernalis^ without tubercles, or with no more 

 than are often shown by these species. The dorsum is then very 

 compressed laterally, and is truncated and bi-carinate, so that 

 young specimens of this shell, except for the wider umbilicus, 

 could readily be mistaken for either of the above, but more espe- 

 cially the latter species, which also occurs in the same rocks.' 



Roemer's figure of the septum seems to have been drawn from 

 a weathered specimen. The diflerences between the details of his 

 lobes and mine are not more than I have frequently observed in 

 individuals of other species.

 The President, Dr. Ruschenberger, in the chair. 



Thii'ty-three members present. 



The following paper was presented for publication : — 



" Description of some new genera of Mollusca." B}' Wm. M. 

 Gabb. 



Mr. Joseph Willcox stated that having felt much interest in 

 the subject of corundum, he had frequently visited the localities 

 of that mineral in Pennsjdvania ; and that during last April he 

 visited many corundum localities in Lowns Co. Ga., and in Clay 

 and Macon Counties in North Carolina. Mr. Willcox exhibited 

 a specimen latel}' obtained from near Unionville, Pa., the central 

 portion of whicli was corundum surrounded by chlorite. The ex- 

 terior part of the corundum was so mixed with chlorite, that there 

 appeared to be an alteration of one of the substances into the 

 other. Mr. Willcox said he had frequently found in several locali- 

 ties in North Carolina, round specimens of chlorite, the central 

 portions of which were corundum, which corresponded in shape to 

 the surrounding mass of chlorite. Tliese nodules of corundum 

 were from one-quarter inch in size to three inches. In some of the 

 specimens the lines were well defined between the corundum and 

 chlorite, while in others these two substances were so mixed as to 

 appear to pass into each other bj^ insensible degrees. 



Mr, Willcox said he had never seen a specimen of this character 

 from any corundum localitj' in Pennsylvania before. Mr. Willcox 

 also exhibited specimens of crj^stals of corundum from Laurens 

 District in South Carolina; one of which was partly altered into 

 margarite, and another was wholly converted into the latter sub- 

 stance. 



Mr. Thomas INIeehan, referring to the cylindrical production 

 presented by Prof. Leidy, said he thought he could confirm Prof 

 Leidy's suspicion that it was not of vegetable origin, but was 

 wholly mineral. There was not only the peculiarity in the appa- 

 rent concentric la^'ers, referred to b}"- Prof. Leidy, but also an 

 entire absence of any trace of medullary raj's which he thought 

 never wholly obsolete in woody petrifactions. But beyond this 

 the diameter of what appeared to have been the pith cavity was 

 far beyond what usuall}" occurred in Dicotyledonous structures of 

 the age which this, b}- the number of circles, ought to be. Although 

 he believed the suggestion had not been made before, he had reason 

 to believe that the pith cavity decreased in diameter with the age 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 267 



of the wood. Thus in the case of the strong shoots which in 

 this country formed the ultimate trunk of the Pauloxonia impe- 

 rialist, the i)ith occupied a space in the centre of from one-quarter 

 to three-quarters of an inch in diameter according to the strength 

 of this shoot; but in some trees about twenty-five 3'ears old, he 

 had seen cut down, the pith cavity was nearly obliterated. It was 

 scarcelj' credible that an}' dicotyledonous shoot of one year's 

 growth ever had a pith as thick as this. 



But besides these incongruities he had been able to trace the 

 origin of similar formations. In central New York, he had seen 

 on a farm a large number of hollow cylindrical substances from 

 one-quarter to one inch or more in diameter which appeared like 

 jjieces of large clay pipe stems. There were man}' successive cir- 

 cular layers as in this specimen. Informed by the farmer that 

 they came in the muck obtained from a swamp near by, he examined 

 the spot, and found in many instances the central portion was 

 occupied by decaying wood and roots. In time these rotted com- 

 pletely away, and left the structure a hollow tube. The mineral 

 substance around this woody matter appeared to be carbonate of 

 lime, and as the swamp was very wet in winter, and partly dry in 

 summer, he supposed the varying temperature of the water at dif- 

 ferent seasons of the year, or pei'haps actual periodical dryness, 

 would give the appearance of annual rings to the deposit, which 

 formed around the woody core. 



He would suggest that probably this piece had been formed in a 

 similar manner, and that after the woody centre which had formed 

 the nucleus of the cylindrical mass had decayed and disappeared 

 through the ends, the crystallized silicious matter had formed in 

 its place. 



Notice of Donation of Fossils, etc., from Wyoming. — Prof. Leidy 

 directed attention to the specimens of fossils and other specimens 

 from Wyoming Territory, presented this evening. 



The fine specimen consisting of a nearly complete dorsal shell 

 of a Trionyx, was found on the ])uttes of Dry Creek, about ten 

 miles from Fort Bridgcr. It was discovered by Maj. K. S. La 

 Motte, commander of the fort, and was kindly presented liy him 

 to the Academy. The shell is about 16^ inches long and nearly 

 as broad. Before comparing it with the specimen of Trionyx gut- 

 tatus it was supposed to be the same, but certain cliaracters aj>- 

 pear to indicate it as a distinct species, which may be named Trio- 

 ny.x uintaensis. The fore and l)ack parts of the carapace are trun- 

 cated as in the existing T. mutints. The back truncation is slightly 

 sinuous, and extends the width of the last two pairs of costal 

 plates. In T. gutlatus the corresponding border is convex and 

 exhibits a deep median and two deep lateral sinuses. The speci- 

 men possesses only six pairs of vertebral plates. 



Of the other fossils a number pertain to a large land tortoise, 




268 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



previously described under the name of Testudo Corsoni. There 

 are two specimens consisting of nearly complete ventral shields^ 

 broken into many species. One of these was found at Grizzly 

 Buttes and presented by Dr. Corson; the other was found at Dry 

 Creek, by Mrs. Anna Carter, the wife of Dr. Carter, and was pre- 

 sented by her to the Academy. The specimens exhibit some va- 

 riation in conformation though they are supposed to pertain to the 

 same species. The anterior lobe of the shield has the episternals 

 much prolonged and truncated. The posterior lobe at the ex- 

 tremity presents a wide and deep angular notch. The surface of 

 the shield posteriorly is deeply concave. The length of the plas- 

 tron is about two feet. 



A third specimen of a ventral shield less perfect than the others, 

 has associated with it the median portion of a dorsal shield or 

 carapace. The specimens were found by Dr. Corson on Grrizzly 

 Butte. These would appear to indicate that the specimens for- 

 merly described and supposed to pertain to a large Emys, for 

 which the name of E. Garteri was proposed, really belong to the 

 same animal. The error was committed on account of the large 

 costal capitula, which accord in their proportions with those of 

 living terapenes. 



Among other specimens presented are some large cylindrical 

 masses of agate, obtained from the buttes in tlie vicinity of Carter 

 Station on the Union Pacific R. R. They simulate, in their form 

 and concentric structure, fossil wood, which they however appear 

 not to be, but are rather of the character of siliceous concretions. 

 Some of them contain an axis of clear white chalcedony, and others 

 are occupied along a central cavity by large yellow crystals of 

 calcite.

DESCEIPTION OF SOME NEW GENEEA OF MOLLUSCA. 

 BY WILLIAM M. GABB. 



The following diagnoses of new genera are published in advance 

 of a more extended paper on West Indian mollusca, now in process 

 of prepariition. The amount of material embodied in that paper is 

 so great, that circumstances will not permit me to illustrate the nu- 

 merous new species, and I avail mj'self of the present means of 

 explaining, bj^ figures, the generic descriptions, which are not al- 

 ways clearly intelligible from verbal descriptions. 



PTEROPODA. 



Fam. LIMACINIDJE. 

 Planorbella, Gabb, pi. 11, fig. 2. 



Shell minute, vitreous, sinistral, apex sunken as in Plano7'bis. 



This genus, from its sinistral character, is evidently allied to 

 Limacina, from which its planorbiform mode of growth distinctly 

 separates it. The type F. imitans, were it dextral, might be mis- 

 taken for a very young specimen of Planorbis ti'ivolvus, so nearly 

 does it copy the form of that shell. 



GASTEROPODA. 



MTJRICIDa;. 

 Metulella, Gabb, pi. 11, fig. 3. 



Shell fusiform, canal more or less produced ; inner lip covered 

 with a thickened plate, continuous posteriorly with the outer lip. 

 Interior of both inner and outer lips stronglj-^ denticulated or 

 transversely striated. Surface cancellated or costate. 



This genus is more distinctly fusiform than Metula, and has the 

 additional character that the inner lip is covered throughout its 

 length by a series of prominent denticles, not necessarily corre- 

 sponding with the covered-up surface ribs. 



Type if. fusiformis. 



TVRRIBM. 

 Gltphostoma, Gabb, pi. 11. fig. 4. 



Shell like Defrancia, but with the inner lip strongly cranulated 

 or transversely' rugose. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 9Y1 



This genus has the same relation to Defrancia that Mclidella 

 bears to Me.tula. The inner lip of G. dentifera^ the only known 

 species, is thickened, and is crossed hy a number of prominences, 

 intermediate in character between teeth and transverse folds. At 

 the same time, the}^ are wholly unlike the one fold of Bormnia^ or 

 the two or three of Cordiera. A better comparison would be with 

 the teeth of Cyprsea. 



BTICCINID^:. 

 EcTEACHELiZA, Gabb, pi. 9. fi;;. 2. 



Shell acuminately oblong, spire elevated (alwa3's truncated in the 

 only species known). Surface compressed near the suture. Inner 

 lip encrusted ; columella sinuous, short ; outer lip produced in 

 advance. This genus seems to be allied in manj' of its characters 

 to Cominella and Truncaria. Like them, it is compressed ad- 

 joining the suture. It shows no trace of umbilicus, as seen in 

 most of the Buccinidre, but its most distinctive character is in 

 its obliquely sub-truncated columalla, which does not reach to 

 the anterior end of the shell. It differs from Truncaria in having 

 no fold on the columella and in the outer lij) not being emargiuate 

 posteriori}'. In E. hnincala, the apex is truncated at all ages, 

 shells of less than half an inch long having lost several of their 

 apical whorls, and it is rare to find more than two entire volutions 

 in any specimen. 



OLIVIDJE. 

 PLOcnELvEA, Gabb, pi. 11, fig. 5. 



Shell olive shaped, suture ncarl}' obsolete, as in Ancillaria ; 

 aperture linear, deepl\' and obliquely notched at the base, as in 

 Dfhophuf!. Outar lip thickened internally, in the middle ; inner 

 lip incrusted and having several transverse folds, of which the 

 upper are the smallest ; columiiclla strongly recurved at the l)ase. 



From its form and general aitpearance, I am inclined to coii.sider 

 this genus as belonging to the Olitudae, although its details of 

 character are strikingly like that of Dibaphus. It seems to form, 

 in a manner, a connecting link between the true Olives and the 

 genus Monoptygma Lea (not of Adams, Sowerl}', etc.) The 

 folds are placed in a reverse order to those of Milra. 



I have before me specimens of Dibaphus edentulus and Mnuritia 

 Barclayi, the typical species of their respective genera. There is 

 no possible room for doubt that D. edentulus is at least sometimes 




212 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



supplied with mitra-like folds. My specimen lias seven or eight, 

 well developed. Consequently 3Iauritia is sj-nouymous with Diba- 

 phus ; and it seems to me that the genus should be placed rather 

 with the Miti-es than with the Cones. The differences between the 

 present genus and Dibaphus are small, and it is possible that the 

 two should be placed side by side, although I strongly suspect 

 that the resemblances are those of imitation rather than of true 

 relationship.

Shell eulimoid, polished, spire elevated, suture nearly obsolete, 

 apex dextral ; no umbilicus ; columella slightly twisted and pro- 

 duced into a short lip-like canal, not emarginated. 



The ivorjMike structure, obsolete suture, and whole general ap- 

 pearance of this little shell prove its close relationship to Eulima, 

 while its faintly twisted columella, extended to such a degree as 

 to produce a short though not notched canal, distinguishes it from 

 the other genera of the family. It resembles in form a miniature 

 lo, from which circumstance the name is derived. I have noticed 

 in some species of true Eulima a slight tendency to expansion of 

 the lip in advance, on the columellar margin.

 Orthaulax, Gabb, pi. 9, figs. 3, 4. 



Shell rounded fusiform, canal moderate, straight and regularly 

 tapering ; adult shell enveloped over the whole spire by an exten- 

 sion of the inner lip ; posterior canal fissure like, formed by the 

 continued edge of the outer lip and running directly to the apex. 

 Outer lip apparently sharp and simple ; anterior notch oblique 

 and broad. 



The discovery of this genus fills an important break in the Ros- 

 tellarias, uniting the true genus Rostellaria, with Conrad's fossil 

 from Galypirax>h.07^us. Unlike both of these genera the canal is not 

 styliform, but robust and comparatively short, and its terminal 

 notch is formed by an almost rectangular truncation of the anterior 

 pai't of the outer lip. Like Bostellaria it has a straight posterior 

 canal, prolonged, however, further than is common in that genus. 

 The canal is similar in structure to that of CaJi/2yt7'apJiorus^ being 

 formed by a squamose plate, but in the latter genus it curves over

backwards, behind the spire, which it ascends to about half its 

 height, and then bends down to near the suture of the body whorl. 

 Unlike the first, and like the second, of its congeners, it has the 

 whole spire enveloped in a plate, which might more probably be 

 described as a posterior extension of the bod}^ whorl, carrying 

 the suture to the extreme apex. The lines of growth ran from the 

 top of the spire to the anterior end of the shell. It carries none of 

 the tubercles seen in Cahjptrapliorus and Tessarolax, and seems, 

 unlike most of the other genera of the family, to have had a simple 

 outer lip, neither thickened, digitate, nor notched.

Shell elongate oval, spire elevated; with a minute, imperforate 

 umbilicus; aperture semi-oval, inner lip acute, sinuous ; anterior 

 end of the aperture terminating in a short, not emarginate canal. 



The first impression produced on looking at this little shell, is 

 that it is probably a Melania. It is however undoubtedly marine, 

 and it has a grouping of characters which ally it so closely to 

 Slriithiolaria, that I am convinced that it is a nearly' related 

 genus. Its spire is very like that of many of the species of the 

 Sfrombidas, and, in the details of its mouth, it differs only from 

 Struthiolaria in having a thinly encrusted inner lip, an acute outer 

 lip and an obsolete umbilicus, instead of the thickened margins 

 and no uml>ilicus of that genus.

This genus, in its thin character and minute hinges, is closel3'' 

 allied to Pholadomya, Thetis, and Neaera, but differs from all in 

 details of the hinge. Nesera has no cardinal tooth, but, in its place, 

 a cartilage pit in each valve. It has a single posterior tooth, 

 while this genus has the anterior equally well developed. In 

 having corresponding teeth in both valves, it differs from Thetis, 

 while its well specialized hinge and its closed ends distinguish it 

 from Pholadomya.

Joseph Willcox made the following remarks about some glacial 

 scorings lately' observed by him in St. Lawrence County, X. Y. 

 Between the village of Kossie and Morristown,on the St. Lawrence 

 River, a distance of eighteen miles, the country is generally a level 

 plateau. The hard potsdam sandstone, alternating with calci- 

 ferous sandstone, underlies a soil so thin that in man}' fields the 

 use of the plow is impracticable; and fence posts are rarely placed 

 in the ground. 



Over this territorv rounded boulders of granite are scattered 

 in great profusion ; though no outcrop of this rock is visil)le for 

 many miles. The sandstone is frequentl}' exposed to view to tlie 

 extent of man}' yards, and on its surface the glacial marks made 

 by the boulders of granite during their passage are cxliiltited 

 in great perfection. An examination made with a pocket compass 

 applied in three places at intervals of several miles determined 

 the course as X. X. East with little variation. X"o glacial marks 

 were observed on the calciferous sandstone, as this rock is 

 disintegrated with too much facility to retain impressions of this 

 character for a long period of time. 



For a distance of thirty miles north of the St. Lawrence, between 

 that river and Rideau Lake, the country is level and characterized 

 l)y the absence of streams of water. The only rocks observed in 

 position were the calciferous sandstone and limestone. Though 

 rounded boulders of granite were abundant, none of the rocks 

 were sufliciently durable to retain the glacial marks. On the north 

 shore of Rideau Lake, in Burgess, is the remarkable locality for 

 apatite (pliosphate of lime). 



This mineral is found in the Laurentian rocks; generally in 

 gneis, but occasionally in limestone. It is ncarl}' always associated 

 with black mica (biotite). Al)out 100 tons per week of apatite 

 . are mined, which is all shipped to Europe.

Two miles southwest of Perth. — Bronze mica (phlogopite), 

 having beautiful hexagonal marks on the cleaveage planes. 



Near Otty Lake, in" North Elmsley — Apatite, pyroxene, black 

 mica (biotite), zircon, red spinel — chondrodite. 



In Burgess. — Apatite, black mica (biotite). 



Near Bob Lake, twenty miles northwest of Perth, the best 

 crystals of apatite are found. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 27T 



Near the St. Lawrence River, six miles southwest of Brockville, 

 large octahedral crystals of irou pj^'ites, some of tbein 4 inches in 

 diameter. 



All of these minerals are well crystallized, except the peristerite 

 and chondrodite, and most of them are found in splendid speci- 

 mens. 



I am indebted to Prof. B. Silliman for the examination of the 

 above-mentioned micas.

attention to some fossils recently received from Dr. J. Van A. 

 Carter, of Fort Bridger, Wyoming. lie characterized them as 

 follows : — 



1. Pal.^iosyops junior. — Intermediate in size to P. paludosus 

 and P. humilis. Founded on portions of a lower jaw agreeing in 

 character with the corresponding parts of P. j}aludosu.-<hnt smaller. 

 Space occupied by the last premolar and the true molars, 4 inches. 

 Antero-posterior diameter of last premolar, 8 lines; of last molar, 

 iTi lines. 



2. UiXTACYON EDAX. — A remarkable animal, probablj^ marsupial. 

 Indicated b}- the greater part of a ramus of the lower jaw resem- 

 bling in its form the corresponding part in the Fox. Number of 

 incisors unknown. Fang of canine indicates a tooth proportion- 

 ately as large as in the latter animal. Molar series following close 

 upon the canine, and consisting of eight teeth! First premolar 

 with a single fang, but lost. Second premolar nearl}- like that in 

 the Fox. Third, anomalous in form as a lower tooth and probably' 

 so altogether. The crown is conical, and is inserted by three 

 fangs, of which the odd one is external to the others. The 

 remaining teeth holding the relative proportions of those in the 

 Fox. Fourth premolar with a conical crown and with a thicker 

 heel than in the latter. The fifth premolar and tlie fore part of 

 tiie crown of the first molar are lost. The back of the crown of 

 the first molar and the succeeding tooth nearly resembling those 

 in the Fox. The last molar is a small tooth as in tlie latter, and 

 is inserted by a single fang. Space occupied l>y the molar series, 

 one and a quarter inches; that of tiie true molars is half an inch. 

 Breadth of first molar, one-fourth inch; of second molar, two lines ; 

 of last molar, one line. 



3. UiNTACYON vouAX. — Apparently a larger species, indicated 

 by a lower jaw fragment containing the second molar, part of tiie 

 first one, and the socket of tiie last. Space occupied by tlie true 

 molars aliouo eiglit lines; breadth of second molar, three lines. 



4. ("hamki-eo pristi.nus. — Indifated l)y a lower jaw fragment

Bemarks on Silver Ore from Colorado, by Geo. A. Konig. — 

 I had an opportunity, lately, to test a silver ore from Coinload, 

 Colorado, and was astonished at the beautiful crimson and flesh- 

 colored incrustation, which was obtained by treating the ore with 

 the point of the inner flame on charcoal. The crimson was most 

 intense in a zone immediately following the yellow incrustation of 

 lead, it went gradually through ditferent shades of flesh-color into 

 the white incrustation produced by the terosyd of antimony. 

 The oi'e was composed of Galena and antimoniferous ruby silver. 

 After a number of experiments with pure ruby silver from 

 Andreasberg, pure Galena, and pui-e sulphide of antimony, I found 

 that a crimson color could only be produced by the presence of all 

 three compounds, or an alloy of silver, lead, and antimony ; and that 

 it appeared only just before the silver button had become nearly 

 pure. Now, if we consider that silver alone, when kept in fusion 

 by a strong oxydizing flame, deposits a brown coating in the 

 immediate neighborhood of the button, that lead produces an 

 incrustation of plumbic oxyd, which is of a dark yellow color 

 while hot and a lighter yellow in the cold, and lastlj', that antimony 

 gives rise to a copious white coating, at some distance from the 

 flame, of antimoni terox3'd, it seems striking that the three 

 metals together should produce a crimson Incrustation. A 

 mechanical mixture of the three oxj'ds — brown, 3'ellow, and white^ 

 cannot be supposed to bring about a crimson color. Also the 

 fact, that only then this color appears, when the silver is nearly 

 pure is suggestive of a peculiar chemical combination, formed of 

 the oxydized metals as soon as these are brought into a certain 

 quantitative relation. 



At the same time it must be inferred that the volatilit}^ of silvei- 

 is increased to a considerable amount when this quantitative rela- 

 tion is reached. This latter reflection might throw, perhaps, some 

 light upon the.inaccuracj' of the cupelling assay in certain dases, 

 where the loss of silver is larger than usually. 



It seems to me of some interest to investigate into the nature 

 of this crimson-colored compound, and I hope to be able to lay 

 before the Academy some positive results regarding it, at an early 

 date. The observation of crimson-colored incrustations from 

 silver ores containing lead and antimony is not new. Prof Richter 

 mentions them in the last edition of '-Plattner's Probirkunst 

 vor dem Loethrohr," Leipzig, 18G5, page 84. But as to the real 

 cause, there has no publication been made, so far as my knowledge 

 goes. 



The death of Samuel Emlen Randolph was announced.

Prof. Cope made some remarks on the Geology of "Wyoming, 

 especially with reference to the age of the coal series of Bitter 

 Creek. lie said that the discovery of the Dinosaur Agalhaicmas 

 sylvesfris had settled the question of age, concerning wliich there 

 bad been much difference of opinion, in favor of the view that they 

 constitute an npper member of the Cretaceous series. In the 

 sections made, he had succeeded in tracing the line of demarcation 

 between these and the lower beds of the Green Kiver epoch, and 

 had found the leaf beds of the former to be immediatel.y covered 

 b}?- deposits of mammalian remains, with an interval of a few feet 

 only.' In the same way. the close approximation of the Evanstou 

 cretaceous coal to tertiary strata was determined by the finding 

 of numerous mammalian and rci^tilian remains in the lower part 

 of the AVahsatch beds of Haydcn, or even in the sandstones over- 

 lying the coal. Here two species of Bathmodon were found, cor- 

 responding with the nearly allied genus Jlelalophodon from the 

 Bitter Creek locality. So far as is yet known, the Balh.modonlidss 

 are diagnostic of tiie Green River formation, and, ou this and 

 other grounds, the Wahsatch beds of Evanston were regarded 

 as belonging to it. A further extension of the Green River 

 formation was found at a point 400 miles westward {see Proc. Am. 

 Philos. Soc, Jul3% 1872), near Elko, Nevada, where fishes and 

 insects occur in thin shales. Some of the former are nearly allied 

 to species from the fish beds of Green River. 



He added that exception had been taken to his claiming the final 

 determination of the cretaceous age of the Bitter Creek coal strata 

 {see Silliman's Journal, I8T2, Dec, p. 480); his critics presuming 

 that he was unacquainted with previous publications on the suliject; 

 It was, however, his knowledge that previous authors had ex- 

 pressed either adverse or doubtful opinions respecting it, that 

 induced him to print the short preliminary notes that had appeared. 

 He was well aware that ^Messrs;. King and Emmons had considered 

 the lower part of these beds as cretaceous, and the upper as 

 tertiani {see Exi)loration 40th Parallel, III. p. 458), on strati- 

 graphic grounds. Since the cretaceous was represented in dilferent 

 parts of the country b}' clays, sands, glauconite, chalk, limestone, 

 and sandstone, he thought that palteontological evidence was 

 needed to complete tlie demonstration. This had not been pro- 

 duced for the locality in question, l)ut the nearest point (Hallville) 

 had been called Tertiary by ^Ir. Meek, and Prof. Lesquereaux 

 (Ifayden's Surve}' of Terrs., 1870, p. 300) had considered the 

 fossil flora of Point of Rocks, forty miles westward, as of ''unknown 

 age." and those of Evanston as miocene. Hayden himself is well 

 known to regard the strata as of uncertain or transitional age. 

 Paheontological determinations of cretaceous age of the Bitter 

 Creek series were very iudefmite up to the publication in rpiestion. 

 ]Jut first he would reuiark, tiiat his critic was doubtless uninformed 

 as to the geograpli}' of W^'oming, when he cited Prof. Marsh's 

 determination of the cretaceous age of the coal of Brush Creek, a 




280 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



localit_y from 150 to 200 miles distant. So witli the determinations 

 from Weljer River (Coalville) 200 miles, and Evanston and Siilpluir 

 Creek 150 miles distant, on the opposite side of the Bridger Basin. 

 He did not regard these as determinations affecting the age of the 

 Bitter Creek Ijeds any more than they did of the Eocene coal of 

 Osino, 200 miles west of them. 



The only approximations to the point were made by Mr. Meek. 

 In King's Survey of the 40th Parallel (1. c. 462), Mr. Meek's 

 nearest points of investigation were the shell beds of Sulphur 

 Creek (Bear River); of these he sa3's, " While I am, therefore, 

 willing to admit that facts ma}' yet be discovered that will warrant 

 the conclusion that some of these estuary beds should be included 

 rather in the Cretaceous than in the Tertiarj', it seems to me that 

 such evidence must either come from included vertebrate remains, 

 etc." This is not very conclusive, and acknowledges in advance 

 the importance of the determination of vertebrates from the same 

 neighborhood (Evanston), and from Bitter Creek, above described. 

 Secondl}^, in Hayden's Survey, 18T0, p. 298, the only determina- 

 tion of the age of coal of the Bitter Creek area is tertiary (Hall- 

 ville). Thirdly, in Hayden's Survey Montana, etc. (1871, p. 375), 

 Mr. Meek enumerates three species from this region (Point of 

 Rocks) as cretaceous, every one with question as to the determi- 

 nation, which, therefore, decides little as to the age of the beds. 

 In the same way all his Coalville species are marked with question. 

 In his earliest investigation in connection with Mr. Englemau, in 

 Capt. Simpson's Report (1860), he expressly states that the age 

 of the Bitter Creek coal series is unknown. 



Thus it seems that a knowledge of the literature of the geology 

 of the Bitter Creek coal, shows : I. The Messrs. King and Emmons 

 on stratigraphic evidence referred the lower part to the cretaceous 

 and the upper to the tertiary. That on Paljeontological grounds, 

 II. Mr. Lesquereaux regards them as tertiary; III. Mr. Meek's 

 evidence is doubtful;^ and, IV. Dr. Hayden has believed in a 

 transition series. 



Hence it appeared to the speaker, that the explorations directed 

 by Dr. Ha3-den during the past season had contributed largely to 

 our knowledge, proving the existence of an interruption between 

 the cretaceous and tertiar}' formations; less it is true than that 

 which exists elsewhere, and similar to that insisted on b}^ Clarence 

 King's survey in the region of Bear River and the Wahsatch 

 country. 



Prof. Cope defined a genus of Saurodont Fishes from the 

 Niobrara Cretaceous of Kansas, under the name of Erisichthe. 

 He stated that it agreed with Portheus and Ichfhyodectes in the 

 absence of nutritious dental foramina on the inner face of the

 Beds constitute a "new zone."

dcntary bone, and especially with Portheua in tlie ii regular sizes 

 of the teeth. The crowns are, however, compressed and knife- 

 like, and closely similar to those of SanrocephaluK. The typical 

 species was called Erisichthe nitida, and was stated to have heeu 

 discovered in the cretaceous formation of Kansas, near to the 

 Solomon River, by Prof. B. F. Mudge. The enamel of the teeth 

 is smooth and glistening, and their outline acuminate and 

 rather elongate. In the anterior part of tlio jaw are two teeth 

 much larger than the others, separated by a small tooth. The 

 posterior of these is much compressed, wliile the anterior is ovnl 

 in section, with one angular edge. Length of tlie restored skull 

 between one and two feet. 



It was added that the Poiihcrfs angiilatittt, Cope, probably 

 belongs to the genus Erisichthe^ and that it differs from E. nitida 

 in its greater size and other features. The genus was further 

 stated to be abundant in certain formations of the Southern States, 

 and in the English chalk. Isolated specimens of large teeth from 

 the latter had been referred to the genus Saarocephalus in the 

 Poissons Fossiles, which could not be distinguished from those of 

 the genus newl}' described.

 of properly arranging the journals and periodicals, especially, is

 large exchanges are received from corresponding societies at home

 the older volumes of a series out of view at the back of the cases 

 to make room for the current numbers. It is not possible to do 

 this, however, where the volumes are large and the book-cases 

 shallow, so that the necessity for additional room is becoming 

 daily more pressing. 



All of which is respectfully submitted,

REPORT OF THE CURATORS. 



The Museum of the Academj' continues in its usual condition, 

 and the more perishable dei)artments are in a fair state of preser- 

 vation. While several remain in a state of comparative confusion, 

 others are in an advanced condition of arrangement. The con- 

 chological cabinet, which novr numbers upwards of 21,000 species, 

 is reported to have nearly one-half of the collection S3stematically 

 arranged and properly- labelled. 



Mr. James A. Ogden, one of the members of the ornithological 

 committee, informs us that during the past 3'ear, the entire collec- 

 tion of birds has been carefull}- examined, and those which were 

 found infested were submitted to the heating process. lie also 

 assures us that the collection is now in good order. Further, 

 several families have been arranged, and about 1400 specimens 

 labelled. 



Several hundred duplicate bird skins were presented to the 

 Chicago Academy of Sciences, according to a special vote of our 

 Academy'. 



The donations and additions to the collections and Museum of 

 the Academy during the year are as follows: — 



Mammals — The skeleton of a Whale, Mefjaptera bellicosn, Cope, 

 from St. Barts, W. I., was presented bj' Wm. S. Vaux. and I. Lea. 

 Dr. Ruschenberger presented a skull, a skeleton, and a mounted 

 skin of a Japan Dog. Dr. 11. Rand presented four skulls of 

 Monkeys, and Dr. H. C. Chapman, the skull of a very old Horse. 

 Several mammal skins from the West Coast were presented by 

 George Davidson. 



Jiirds — Mr. James A. Ogden, of the ornithological committee,

The Curators regret to state, that during the past year several 

 valuable minerals have been stolen from the Museum. It may be 

 added that in consequence of the present great extent of the latter, 

 and the want of proper labelling and numbering, with a catalogue 

 of the collections, we are unable in many instances, to discover 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 287 



depredations and their extent. It is to be hoped that in a short 

 time the Academy will feel the importance of appointing a paid 

 curator and assistants, whose duty it shall be as early as possible, 

 to put the Museum in complete order of arrangement, to number 

 all its specimens, and prepare a catalogue of the same.

REPORT OF THE BOTANICAL COMMITTEE. 



To the President and Members of the Academy : — 



The Committee on Botany respectfully report, that during the 

 year good collections of plants have been contributed by Dr. 

 Gibbons from California, T. Meehan from Colorado and Western 

 Kansas, Prof. Davidson from California, Dr. Leidy from the Uinta 

 Mountains, and Professor Asa Graj', a large package chiefly of 

 tropical rubiaceoe. The American plants have added largely' to 

 the value of the herbarium, in regard to botanical geograph}', and 

 hy furnishing specimens in varying conditions of growth, besides 

 in a few cases adding to the number of species in the already 

 pretty full collection. 



The Committee are desirous of bringing the general herbarium 

 nearer completeness. In order the better to ascertain its defici- 

 encies, the work of preparing a catalogue of species has been com- 

 menced. Iloiigh lists have been prepared of the first twenty-three 

 volumes, serving as indices to each volume temporarily; and it is 

 hoped that the whole one hundred and twent^'-scven volumes will 

 b(! thus far finished b}' the next j'oar. 



Thomas Meeiian, for the Committee.

REPORT OF RECORDER OF BIOLOGICAL AND 

 MICROSCOPICAL SECTION. 



Read before the Section December 2d, 1873, and directed to be forwarded to 

 the Academy as the Report of the Section for the current year. 



The closing business 3'ear of 1872 leaves our Biological and 

 Microscopical Section in a much more healthy and vigorous con- 

 dition than did its immediate predecessor. In spite of the gloomy 

 forebodings, which twelvemonths ago threatened our department 

 with complete and speedy extinction, we can this evening look 

 back to a better record, of real scientific work accomplished 

 during the past year, than even warm friends of a Microscopical 

 society dared at one time to hope was witliin the bounds of possi- 

 bility'. When we remember that our eminently honorable and 

 useful parent Academy of tlie Natural Sciences, with her far larger 

 membership, and wider claims upon the scientific world for sup- 

 port, has on a few untoward occasions even found it difficult to 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELrillA. 289 



convene the quorum requisite to transact her ordinary- business, 

 we may well feel encouraged to persevere in thus meeting togetlier, 

 although the paucit}' of our number sojnetimes might otherwise be 

 enougli to dishearten the most earnest seeker after truth among us. 



Prominent in the list of triumphs during the past year, stands 

 of course our Exhibition of microscopes and microscopical appa- 

 ratus, given in Horticultural Hall, to the American Medical Asso- 

 ciation, on the evening of May Tth, and witnessed with warmly 

 expressed satisfaction, not only by the members of the National 

 Convention and their ladies, but also bj- hundreds of the inhabi- 

 tants of Philadelphia, whose awakening interest in the wonders 

 and beauties of microscop\', as well as their enjoyment of the 

 results attained by microscopic investigation, formed a gratifying 

 feature of the occasion. At this exhibition one hundred and six 

 instruments, adjusted to a classified collection of objects, illus- 

 trating most of the different applications of the higher magnifying 

 powers, to researches in Medicine, Natural History, Botany, 

 Chemistry, etc., were arranged upon our tables. The display- of 

 microscopes is said to have been the largest ever gathered 

 together for a similar reception in America, and it excited much 

 admiration among both visitors and citizens. There is no doubt 

 that such demonstrations of downright facts, in regard to the 

 advancement of our knowledge of nature, either with or without 

 the aid of the microscope, will lead to a more and more just 

 appreciation of the inestimable value an Academy for the study 

 of the natural sciences has to the comraunit}- at large, and thus 

 contribute in some measure towards creating that much needed 

 disposition, among merchants and business men, to foster sueh 

 an institution, b^'- subseriljing the comparatively trivial amount 

 of pecuniary endowment necessary for its successftd opi-ration 

 aud supi)ort. 



Among the more or less elaborated papers and oral communica- 

 tions, presented before the section during the past year, may lu; 

 enumerated Dr. Henry (". ('liapnian's leniarUs ujion I']uiIm yology, 

 pr(>fusely illustrateil by charts and tlrawings, and his comuK'nls 

 this evening upon the Polycystina, etc ; Dr. Al!)crt Fricke's 

 valuable contril)ution (o the mc(lical history of our recent I"](iuine 

 epifleniic; Dr. J. 11. ]SrcQiiillen's description of Salivary cali-iilus 

 and Oral Mici'ozoa; Dr. Isaac Xorris' p;ipcr on the History and 

 value ol" Polarized ligiit as applied to llu- microsct)pc ; Di. .I.(r. 




290 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



Hunt's dissertation on the Preparation and preservation of 

 Tissues; Mr. Joseph Zentmayer's discourse upon Erectors and 

 a new Erecting prism; Dr Jas. Tyson's article on Urinary 

 microscopy, and his interesting oral communication upon Practical 

 Histology in Germany; and Dr. Jos. G. Richardson's papers on 

 Certain Human Parasitic Fungi, and their relations to disease, 

 and upon a new method of preserving Tumors and some urinary 

 deposits during transportation. 



Discussions upon the various subjects thus brought under the 

 consideration of the members, have been remarkal^le for their un- 

 usuall}^ practical and useful character; indeed, so eminent have 

 they appdired in this respect, that reports of our proceedings have 

 always been warmly welcomed b}'^ the Editors of The Philadelphia 

 Medical Times, in whose interesting columns they, as well as 

 several of the papers read before the Section, have from time to 

 time been published. 



All of which is respectfull}' submitted, 



Jos. G. Richardson, Recorder. 



REPORT OF CONSERVATOR OF CONCHOLOGICAL 

 SECTION. 



The Conservator of the Conchological Section respectfiill}'' re- 

 ports tliat the donations to the Cabinet, during the past year, have 



been as follows: — 



Beadle, Rev. E. R. Helix Schrammi, from St. Martins, "W. I. 



Bland, Thos. Bulimus aui^eolus, from West Indies. 



Conrad, T. A. Ancylus, from Trenton, N. J., and twent^'-seven 

 species of Unionidse, from the vicinity of Raleigh, N. C, 

 determined for tlie Section by Mr. Lea. 



Dall, "W". H. Nine species of Acmeea, types of new species. 



Gabb, Wm. M. Small collection of terrestrial and marine 

 mollusca, from St. Domingo. 



Jewett, Col. E. Two species, from Charlotte Harbor, Fla.

 pura lajyillus, from Isle of Shoals, off Portsmouth, N. H. 



Pease, W. Harper. Six species of marine mollusca, from 

 Central Pacific Ocean, types. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 291 



SuMMiCHRAST, Dr. Spccics of Cijlindrella, from near Tehuan- 



tepec. 

 Yarrow, Dr. H. C. A small collection of marine shells, from 



Fort Macon, X. C. 



Forty-four species of West Indian Helices, new to the collec- 

 tion, were purchased from Mr. Thos. Bland. 



Thirt3--eight species not heretofore in the collection of the 

 Academy, from the Island of Mauritius, were presented b}' the 

 following gentlemen: Wm. S. Yaux, 13 species; Isaac Lea, 5; 

 Wra. M. Gabb, 5; Benj. Smith Lyman, 4; S. R. Roberts, 2; Chas. 

 F. Parker, 5; and Geo. W. Tryon, Jr., 4. 



The Committee on the arrangement of the Collection have been 

 working industriously, and report that during the year the 

 arrangement of the Land and Fresh-water shells has been com- 

 pleted, as well as that of the Xeriles, Xeretinas. Harps, Astarles, 

 Cardilas, and a portion of the Veneridse. The amount of work 

 'done exceeds that of any previous year, as the following state- 

 ment will show: Number of species determined during 1872, 

 28G2 ; number of labels written, 4898 ; number of specimens 

 cleaned and mounted, 19,932. The total number of species 

 determined by the Committee to date is 6893; total number of 

 labels written, 12,0G7; total number of specimens mounted, 

 40,873. 



Our system of exchange has been during the past year discon- 

 tinued, in consequence of the great and increasing difficulty of 

 obtaining desiderata except by purchase. This is owing to the 

 nearly complete condition of many i)ortions of the collection. It 

 may be mentioned, as an illustration of this fact, that out of 913 

 species recently received for examination from the Lsland of 

 Mauritius, but thirty-eight species, reported above, could be found 

 new to the collection. 



All of whicli is respectful!}' submitted, 



Edward J. Nulax, Conservator. 



At an adjourned meeting held January 7, 1><73, tlic following 

 were elected members: Chas. Macaloster, AVm. B. lU-nunt, 

 Riciiard II. Townsend, M.D., Wm. Logan Fox, Dr. (has. A. 

 Siegfried, U.S.X., and Mrs. Caroline Beiinoek.

NEW HALL 



ACADE31Y OF Is^ATURAL SCIEXCES OF 

 PHILADELPHIA. 



The corner-stone of a new building for the Academy of Xatural 

 Sciences of Philadelphia was laid, AVednesday, October 30, 1872, 

 at the southeast corner of Race and Nineteenth streets. The dig- 

 ging of the cellar of the north wing was commenced Jul}' 0. 18T2. 



At half-past eleven o'clock A.M. man}' of the officers and mem- 

 bers of the society assembled at the hall, northwest corner of 

 Broad and Sansom streets, and walked together to the site of the 

 new building. 



At twelve o'clock, noon. Dr. Ruschenberqer, President of the 

 Society and Chairman of the Building Committee, addressed the 

 assembled crowd in substance as follows : — 



Ladies and Gentlemen : — 



We have assembled to-da}' to manifest our satisfaction that, 

 through the intelligent liberality of a comparatively few of our 

 fellow citizens, we are enabled to commence the erection, on this 

 spot, of a new building adapted to the purposes of the Academy 

 of Xatural Sciences of Philadelphia. The want of a sufficiently 

 capacious ediflce has embarrassed, and in some degree retarded, 

 the progress of the institution during many years. The citizens of 

 Philadelphia and of the State of Pennsylvania iiave a wide-spread 

 interest in the success of this enterprise, although that interest is 

 not universally recognized or admitted. 



The completion of the entire edifice, one wing of which we have 




commenced to build, and the arrangement in it of the collections 

 now belonging to the institution, will be as palpable evidence of 

 educational progress, in one department of the exact sciences, as 

 can be presented ; and it will be so estimated by those who may 

 come here from abroad, in the summer of 18*70, to determine our 

 intellectual advancement during the hundred years of our national 

 existence. 



The object of the society is to acquire exact knowledge of all 

 created things, within the narrow limits of man's capability to in- 

 vestigate, and to give freely to the whole world the knowledge 

 which may result from its labors. Its constant effort is to remove 

 the veil which conceals from us the facts of the Creation in order 

 that all may perceive and recognize their wonderful wisdom and 

 beauty. Attainment of precise truth is the extremely difficult 

 task assumed by this, and everj^ society formed for the cultivation 

 of the natural sciences. Yet, under an erroneous and wide-spread 

 notion that the pursuit of truth on this line is in some indefinite 

 manner detrimental to societ}^, it has been and is still opposed by 

 very many intelligent people. 



Truth is a unity, vastly multiple in constitution, but no one of 

 its parts is inconsistent with another. Everj- absolutely estab- 

 lished truth, be it great or small, must be in perfect accord with 

 all that has been or ever will be ascertained b}^ nian. The crite- 

 rion of truth in natural science is its harmon}^ with all that is 

 absolutely known. Everj^ scientific assumption which is not true, 

 however plausible it ma}'' appear on presentation, Avill prove to be 

 discordant. In God's creation there is no conflict or contradic- 

 tion of parts. When accurately interpreted the perfect harmony 

 of their relations will be manifest. The book of nature is entirely 

 free from error; it contains no misstatement of any kind. Surely 

 such a book may be studied without perverting the mind from 

 truth or establishing a preference for what is not reality. 



Seeking the truths of nature demands an extensive workshop, 

 in which to collect and arrange conveniently for use the numerous 

 implements employed in the work. The implements consist in 

 collections of all those natural objects which have been described 

 properl}' classified and labelled, ready for study and comparison 

 with those supposed to be new — that is, not previously described — 

 and also an extensive collection of books in wliich are recorded the 

 results of investigations made b}^ naturalists in all parts of the 




5 



world ; for he who wonhl add to the stock of knowledge in any 

 department of science needs to be acquainted with what is known 

 already in it, or he maj' find himself laboring to discover what 

 has been ascertained. A museum and library, chemical apparatus 

 and microscopes, constitute the machiuer3' necessar3' to facilitate 

 and guide his labors. Such a museum and library- and laboratory, 

 in such condition as to be utilized by the naturalists, require 

 large space, and this demand for space increases with the progress 

 of our knowledge. 



The Academy now possesses more than 6000 minerals ; 700 rocks ; 

 65,000 fossils; 70,000 species of plants; 1000 species of zoo- 

 phj-tes ; 2000 species of crustaceans ; 500 species of myriapods 

 and arachnidans ; 25,000 species of insects ; 20,000 species of 

 shell-bearing mollusks ; 2000 species of fishes ; 800 species of rep- 

 tiles ; 31,000 birds, with the nests of 200, and the eggs of 1500 

 species ; 1000 mammals and nearly 900 skeletons and pieces of os- 

 teolog}-. Most of the species are represented by four or five speci- 

 mens, so that, including the archreological and ethnological cabi- 

 nets, space is required now for the arrangement of not less than 

 400,000 objects, besides the library of more than 22,500 volumes. 



Besides space enough in our workshop to appropriateh- arrange 

 this vast number of implements, room is desired for a separate 

 and distinct arrangement of all objects necessary to illustrate the 

 natural history- of the State of rcnnsylvania, as well as a suitable 

 room in which lectures on the natural sciences may be delivered. 



To set up this great museum and liljrar}-, laboratory and lecture 

 room, we have a plot of ground, measuring little more than an 

 acre, for which we are indebted to the liberalitj' of members of 

 the society and individual citizens. No substantial encourage- 

 ment has been yet received from the government of this city, nor 

 from that of the State of Pennsylvania. 



In this respect, the polic}' of some of the State Legislatures is 

 more encouraging. Massachusetts has given liberal aid to the 

 Boston Society of Natural History; to the Museum of Compara- 

 tive Zoology, at Cambridge; and to the Institute of Teciuiulog}'. 

 New York maintains a museum of natural history, at Albany, by 

 annual appropriations, and has given eighteen acres of land, valued 

 at four millions of dollars, and five hundred thousand dollars be- 

 sides, to establish a natural history museum at Central Park, in 

 the city of New York. 




The institutions thus aided are of great value but no one of 

 them as a whole equals ours in scientific importance or intrinsic 

 worth, or is better entitled to public favor. 



I mention these facts in no spirit of envy or detraction. We 

 are all gratified to know that the number of laborers in the vast 

 field in which we work is ever^^where increasing. The encourage- 

 ment extended to them by State governments implies that the 

 cultivation of the natural sciences is becoming more and more 

 wisely appreciated, and more widely diffused. 



I wnll detain you no longer. 



Rev. E. R. Beadle, D.D., was introduced to the audience and 

 said, substantial!}', that Philadelphia had been facetiously desig- 

 nated as " a dining station on the road to New York ;" but he 

 doubted whether that was all that can be truthfully said about 

 Philadelphia. He referred to the hospitals for the sick, asylums 

 for children, retreats for the aged and indigent, and the neat and 

 comfortable domiciles provided for working people, as well as to 

 the schools, colleges, nniversit}-, and expressed his belief that, 

 although not j-et finished, Philadelphia is doing very well. The 

 building of the Academy of Natural Sciences is one of the works 

 yet to be done. He alluded to the popular ignorance of even the 

 simplest matters which influence the life, happiness, and comfort 

 of humanitj'', and said that a workshop is wanted in which young 

 people may be taught to recognize the properties and uses of nat- 

 ural objects — to distinguish what is fact from what is not — and be 

 trained to apply such knowledge intelligently for the benefit of 

 themselves and of mankind. 



Prof. J. AiTKEN Meigs, M.D., of the Jefferson Medical College, 

 was next introduced and delivered the following address : — 



Three-score years, heavy-laden with the endless series of changes, 

 the thrilling narrative of private joys and sorrows, hopes and fears? 

 the extraordinary record of national triumphs and social defeats, 

 and the wondrous history of the great achievements and miserable 

 failures that go to make up the life-history of two generations of 

 men, have been forever engulfed in the illimitable ocean of the 

 past, since the occurrence of that event the happy development of 

 which you this day celebrate. 




In this brief period — comprised within the life-time of some 

 who now hear mj' voice — the most remarkable historical events 

 have occurred, and many surprising scientific discoveries and im- 

 portant industrial applications of them have been made. Indeed, 

 by means of intellectual inquiry and its handmaid, applied science, 

 the social and industrial condition of the world, during this short 

 interval, has been completely revolutionized. 



Look at Philadelphia as it appeared at the commencement of 

 1812, as it has been pictured, in truth, b}' a medical worthy of that 

 time. A city whose inhabitants numbered 111,120, or less than 

 one-sixth of its present population, occupying an area not one-half 

 of that over which it now stretches its huge proportions ; a city 

 which contained 25,814 dwelling-houses, 6955 public buildings, 

 stores, manufacturing establishments, etc.; 42 churches, 11 insur- 

 ance offices, 4 banks, 2 hospitals, a universit}', an Academy of Fine 

 Arts, a museum of natural histor}', and 2 theatres in which per- 

 fo-mances were occasional!}- given ; a cit}' in which 51 printing- 

 oflLces, employing 153 hand-presses, were in operation ; a city 

 boasting of 8 daily, 9 weekly, and several semi-weekly newspapers 

 havng a combined circulation of about 01,000 copies per week — 

 sucL, in brief, was the citv of Penn sixty years ago. 



Ntither in this country nor in Great Britain, at that time, had 

 railroads and steamboats been put into operation. Electricity, 

 the nodern Puck, had not yet learned the art of " putting a girdle 

 rounc about the earth in forty minutes." The telegraph had not 

 been invented. Communication between distant points was slow 

 and imcertain. Instead of a few minutes, as is now the case, 

 weeks were required for tlie transmission of intelligence from 

 Philaddphia to the Gulf of Mexico. Our citj' was then two 

 months distant by sail from Europe, and six from California, in- 

 stead cf being, as at present, within eight or nine days of the 

 former, and but seven days' ride by rail from the latter. The 

 steam-jiow, the reaping-machine, and the screw-ship were not in 

 existen(e. The printing-press and the spinniug-jcnu}' were worked 

 by hand instead of by steam. The photographic art was not 

 known. The old-fashioned tinder-box and brimstone-matcli had 

 not 3'et been replaced b\- the lucifor niatt-li, and oil, instead of gas, 

 was an universal means of illumination. In short, a thousand 

 mechanical and chemical influences which arc incessantly changing 

 the aspect of our present civilization were then utterly unknown. 




Come back with me, in imagination, to tlae period of time just 

 mentioned. It is the evening of the last day of the Aveek, near the 

 close of January, and the nipping air sweeps eagerly up this broad 

 thoroughfare from the icy river below. Let us cross over and take 

 refuge from the wintry blast in yonder quaint-looking house at the 

 northwest corner of Second and High streets. From the imposing 

 arra}' of many-colored bottles, seen through the dimly-lighted 

 window, and the inevitable sign of the pestle and mortar sur- 

 mounting the doorway, you gather, at a glance, that it is the shop 

 of a druggist. Let us enter, for this is one of the centres of the 

 literary and scientific gossip of the town. Passing through an 

 atmosphere odorous with the emanations of camphor, rhubarb, 

 and musk, we find ourselves in a little room at the rear, and in the 

 presence of a group of men gathered around a table and engaged 

 in earnest conversation. At the further end of the room stands s 

 young man, who, with animated countenance and impressive ges- 

 ticulations, appears to be addressing the others upon a subject of 

 some importance. The lineaments of his face bear the stamp of 

 an earnest, ingenuous, and benevolent mind ; and now^, as he ceases 

 speaking, and his face falls again into its accustomed repose, it 

 assumes an unmistakably reflective character. This is the pro- 

 prietor of the store — one John Speakman, a native of Bucks county, 

 and a member of the religious society of Friends. That 3^(ung 

 gentleman sitting at the right of the table is Jacob Gillians, a 

 dentist by profession, and an ardent lover of the natural sciaices. 

 The individual by his side, bending over the table, with his eyes 

 intently fixed upon the speaker, is John Shinn, Jr., a manufictur- 

 ing chemist from ISTew Jersey. In front of the latter, and upon 

 the opposite side of the table, sits a native of France, Nicholas J. 

 Parmautier, by name, who follows the occupation of a distil er and 

 manufacturer of cordials. That man yonder, apparently older 

 than his comrades, and whose broad and massive brow clearl}^ 

 betokens a mind given to profound thought, is Dr. Gerard Troost, 

 a Hollander of Bois-le-Duc, a man of large attainments ii mine- 

 ralogy and chemistry especially, and at one time a protcgi of the 

 King of Holland. In the gentleman at the near end of the table, 

 who appears to be recording the remarks of the chairmiin, you 

 perceive another ph^-sician, Dr. Camillus M. Mann, an Irish refu- 

 gee, who having boldly but unsuccessfully struck, in 1798, for the 




libert}' of his native land, has fled from its shores to cast his lot 

 with the dwellers in the Xew "World. 



In this outline picture, thus hastily sketched, behold the Tncn 

 who, with slender pecuniary means, but with admirable jDrevision 

 and indomitable will, laid broadl}' and deeply the foundations of 

 the Academj' of Natural Sciences of Pliiladelphia, on the evening 

 of Saturday, the 25th day of January, 1812. I say broadly and 

 deepl}', and I saj- it advisedly, for, from the scanty memoranda of 

 the early meetings of the Academy which have been preserved, 

 we gather that the founders considered ignorance of the laws of 

 nature to be the prolific parent of many of the evils to which man 

 is subjected, and they, consequently, recognized fully the necessity 

 of improving the condition of mankind by seeking to enlarge the 

 bounds of knowledge, and imparting what they thus acquired to 

 others. 



Furthermore, thej' clearl}' perceived, as we learn from the early 

 minutes of the society, that the operations of nature demand un- 

 prejudiced, attentive, and severe scrutiny: and, in order that they 

 might aid each other by a comparison of observations, they also 

 declared that their discussions must be free. 



Freedom of scientific thought and discussion, the cultivation of 

 the natural sciences exclusively, and the diffusion of this kind of 

 knowledge among the people, were the principles which guided 

 Speakman and his associates in their great undertaking. Indeed, 

 the founders of the Academy (under which honorable title must 

 also be included that eminent naturalist, ^Ir. Thomas S;iy, who 

 became one of their number a few months after their first meeting) 

 were evidently penetrated with the restless spirit of scientific 

 inquiry which was then so rife in Europe. The fact, moreover, of 

 living, as they did, in that memorable quarter of a century- which 

 witnessed the great American and French revolutions, and the 

 famous though short-lived Irish rebellion, could not fail, in tlie 

 case of such young, enthusiastic, and reflective minds, to impress 

 them strongly with ideas of political freedom and the necessit}- of 

 establishing this freedom upon the enduring rock of the enlighten- 

 ment of the people. 



Mr. (jilliains was born in the closing year of our revolutionary 

 war, and Mr. Say four years later; while Dr. Troost, the first 

 President of the Academy, was ushered into the world in the very 

 year made memorable by the declaration of American Indcpend- 




10 



ence. He was eighteen years of age, therefore, when the French 

 Revolution terminated with the death of Robespierre. Having 

 received his medical diploma from the University of Leyden, he 

 practised pharmacy for a short time in Amsterdam and at the 

 Hague. Afterwards he travelled extensively in France, Italy, 

 German}', and Switzerland, and became the pupil and companion 

 of the celebrated Abbd Rene Just Haii}', with whom he studied 

 crystallography. In Paris he became the associate of many of the 

 most eminent scientific men of the da}', and was elected in 1810 a 

 correspondent of the Museum of Natural History of France. Two 

 years later we find him in Philadelphia assisting in founding the 

 Acaden\y. Of Dr. Mann we simply know that in 1798 he was old 

 enough to take an active part in the Irish rebellion, and that 

 before coming to this country he also had spent some time in 

 France seeking aid for his compatriots. Mr. William Maclure, 

 who joined the Academy in June, 1812, and who acted as its 

 second president for more than twenty-two years, was born in 

 Scotland in 1*763. Endowed with an eminently philanthropic and 

 benevolent mind, and believing that knowledge and intelligence 

 are the true sources of human happiness and prosperity, he used 

 the large wealth of which he was happily possessed, to foster 

 institutions of learning and to disseminate knowledge as much as 

 possible. He travelled much in his own country, in France, Spain, 

 the United States, and Mexico. We are told by his biographers 

 that he " visited these countries while in a state of political revo- 

 lution, that he might be near to extend assistance to the poor and 

 sufljering." Now a moment's reflection will show, I think, that 

 these men, in the course of their studies and travels, could not 

 avoid being impressed by the spirit of free inquiry in science and 

 politics by which they were ever3'where surrounded. In view of 

 the facts just presented, and from what we know of the lives and 

 opinions of the originators of the Academy, and of the motives 

 which actuated them in banding together for the cultivation of 

 natural knowledge, it appears to me not inappropriate to regard 

 the Academy as, in realit}^, an outgrowth of that great intellectual 

 and democratic movement which, during the latter half of the 

 eighteenth century, swept over Europe and a part of America, 

 and was characterized by an extraordinary activity in the study 

 of nature, coupled with a growing demand on the part of the 

 governed classes for larger social and political privileges. So 




11 



correct does this idea appear to me that I am led, in this con- 

 nection, to refer briefly to the condition of science in Europe in 

 the latter part of the eighteenth and the beginning of the present 

 century', when the first feeble and apparentl}' insignificant attempts 

 were made to rear, in Philadelphia, a temple of the natural 

 sciences. 



To the student of history it is well known that in France, under 

 the administrations of those famous cardinals — the ftir-seeing 

 Richelieu and the astute Mazarin — a powerful impulse was given 

 to the highest branches of learning. From the hour that Louis 

 XIV. ascended the throne, however, this impulse began slowly to 

 be arrested by the gradual inauguration of a policy fatal alike to 

 the intellectual and mechanical interests of the countr}'. Mathe- 

 matics, astronomy, the mechanical and inventive arts, anatomv, 

 physiology, theoretical and practical medicine — all fell more or 

 less rapidly into decay. With the death of Louis in 1715, the 

 intellectual decadence of France was complete. Her great men, 

 one after another, had passed away, until at last she was without 

 literature, science, and arts. With the appearance of a new order 

 of literary and scientific men, in the middle of the eighteenth cen- 

 tury, she began at length to emerge from this stagnant condition. 

 In 1735 Newton's "Treatise on Fluxions" was translated into 

 French by Bufljon. Three years later Voltaire made the people 

 of France acquainted with the philosoph}' of Newton in a manner 

 so clear and forcible as to cause it to supersede that of Descartes. 

 He also gave popularity among his countrymen to the writings 

 of Locke, from which, according to lUickle, Condillac drew the 

 materials of his sj'stem of metaphysics, and Rousseau his thcor}- 

 of education. In 1749 attention was strongly directed to the 

 stud}' of natural history b}' the celebrated Hufibn, who, in that 

 year, commenced the publication of his famous work on that sub- 

 ject, and in glowing language advocated the unity of tlie human 

 race, and endeavored to show how climate :ind other physical 

 conditions influence the geographical distribution of animals. In 

 1751 a popular account of Bacon and his pliilosophy was con- 

 tributed by D'Alcmbert to the Encyclopedia. In 1754 Condillac, 

 who Cousin declares was the only metaphysician produced l)y 

 France in the eighteenth century, published his famous treatise 

 on Sensations. Four years afterward appeared the remarkable 

 essay of Hclvetius on the Mind. Thc^c works undoubtedly gave 




12 



a powerful impetus to the study of the natural sciences at the 

 close of the last centur}-. For their authors, with great ability' and 

 ■with much logical acumen and fulness of illustration, maintained 

 most peremptorily, as Locke had done more than a century before, 

 that all our knowledge is reall}^ due to the stud}' of the external 

 world. Under the influence of the leading principle thus forcibl}^ 

 inculcated, some of the ablest intellects of France began to devote 

 themselves, with extraordinary activity, to the study of the phe- 

 nomena of nature. The laws of the radiation and conduction of 

 heat were worked out by Prevost and Fourier ; electrical phe- 

 nomena were investigated by D'Alibard and Coulomb, while 

 Malus and Fresnel, by their researches upon double refraction 

 and the polarization of light, extended the bounds of our knowl- 

 edge of optics. At the same time Lavoisier, b}- investigating with 

 great ability the laws of oxidation, placed chemistry upon a 

 strictly scientific basis, and, in conjunction with Berthollet, De 

 Morveau, and Fourcro}', laid down, for the first time, a systematic 

 chemical nomenclature. Meanwhile, geology was also cultivated 

 with eminent success by Buffon, Rouelle, Desmarest, Dolomieu 

 and Montlosier ; while astronomy, both physical and mathemati- 

 cal, was materially advanced by La Grange's discovery- of the 

 periodical inequalities of the planets, and b^' the publication of 

 the " Mechanique Celeste" of Laplace, in which was clearly pre- 

 sented to the world for the first time the famous " nebular hypo- 

 thesis" — an hypothesis which is steadil}" approaching the character 

 of a demonstration with every new discover}'- in astronomical 

 science, and which has not only anticipated, but has also paved 

 the way for, the co-ordinate doctrine of evolution in biology. In 

 1762 Daubenton gave a new interest to palreontologj' b}' apply- 

 ing, for the first time, the principles of comparative anatomy to 

 the study of fossil bones. In this epoch, also, the illustrious Cu- 

 vier gave to both geology and paleontology an eminently philoso- 

 phical character b}' practically associating the study of the earth's 

 strata with the fossil remains found therein. This greatest of all 

 descriptive anatomists did much for philosophical natural history 

 b}' showing that the classification of animals must be based upon 

 the comprehensive study of their organs rather than their ex- 

 ternal characters. Histology, botany, and mineralogy likewise 

 found zealous investigators during this remarkable intellectual 

 period. While Bichat with scientific skill and industry was 




13 



demonstrating that the study of the organs of an animal must be 

 subservient to the study of the tissues composing them, and wiiile 

 Adansou, Duhamel de Monceau, Desfontaines, and cspeuiall}- 

 Jussieu were bringing to light man}' of the important facts con- 

 cerning the structure and physiology of the vegetable kingdom, 

 Rome de Lisle and Ilaiiy were as actively' engaged in studying 

 the structure of minerals and applying the principles of geometry 

 to the elucidation of their forms. 



Turning, now, to Great Britain, we find that science, though not 

 so actively cultivated, during this period, as in France, was by no 

 means neglected. In 1753 was founded, at the cost of the govern- 

 ment, the British Museum, Avhich for man}' years has been so largely 

 instrumental in promoting natural science in the United Kingdom. 

 Between the jears 1759 and 1804, the science of thermotics was 

 greatly advanced by Black and Leslie, who, with much breadth of 

 mind and industry, not only demonstrated the laws of specific and 

 latent heat, but made possible the recognition of those remarkable 

 doctrines, the development of which has stamped the science of the 

 present century with its distinctive character. I allude to the inde- 

 structibility of force and the correlation of the forces as modes of 

 motion. At tliis time, many of the fundamental facts of cUemistr}'' 

 were discovered. Carbonic acid gas was isolated and studied in 

 1757 by Black. The discovery of oxygen was announced in 1774 

 by Priestley, together witli a description of some of its important 

 properties. A j^ear later lie made known the fact tluit tlie air is 

 composed of oxygen and nitrogen; and in 1770 lie nrade pliysi- 

 ology his debtor by proving that the change in color which the 

 blood undergoes in passing through the lungs is due to the ab- 

 sorption of oxygen — an important and fundamental fact in the 

 chemistry of respiration. From 1799 to 1S12, chemical science 

 was also promoted by Sir Humphry Davy, whose great aclueve- 

 ment — the decomposition of the fixed alkalies by galvanism — 

 constituted a new era in this science. In 1808, just four years 

 before the founding of the Academy, Dalton gave another impetus 

 to chemical philosoph}' b}' announcing, as deductions from the 

 atomic theory, the well-known laws of definite combining propor- 

 tions — laws which have done so much to perfect the analytical 

 and synthetical processes of tlie chemist. Anotlier remarkable 

 discovery of this period— the composition of watei— was maile in 

 1783, by Watt and Cavendish, inilepemlently of each otlier. 




14 



In the early years of the present century, optical science re- 

 ceived a powerful impulse from the labors of Dr. Thomas Young, 

 "who made the important discovery of the interference of light, and 

 gave to double refraction a rational theory by advancing a plau- 

 sible hypothesis of the propagation of light through an elastic 

 medium in a manner not contradictory to any of the well-known 

 facts and laws of dynamics. 



Geology, too, was not without its zealous cultivators. In 1788 

 Hutton published his celebrated " Theory of the Earth," in which, 

 according to Lyell, may be found the germ of the metamorphic 

 theory. Scientific geology in England owes its existence to Wil- 

 liam Smith, who, between the 3'ears 1790 and 1815, made a labori- 

 ous examination of different strata in Great Britain, and finally 

 published the first complete geological map that ever appeared. 

 In 1807 was formed the London Geological Society, the mem- 

 bers of which early began with untiring industry to collect the 

 facts relative to the structure of the earth's crust. Owing to the 

 assiduous and intelligent labors of John Hunter, comparative 

 anatomy, in the last quarter of the eighteenth centur}', became, 

 for the first time, in Great Britain, a science of importance. In 

 astronojuical science many important facts were discovered and 

 recorded. Maskelyne, in 1790, published an admirable catalogue 

 of the stars, while Sir William Herschel, between 1799 and 1820, 

 may be said to have recreated astronomy and enlarged our views 

 of the immensity of space by his astounding discoveries. 



In the mean time, science was steadil}'^ though less rapidly un- 

 folding its fair proportions in various parts of Europe. The inte- 

 gral calculus and analytical mechanics were greatly improved 

 between 1727 and 1783 by Euler, the celebrated Swedish geometer. 

 In Germany, astronomy was cultivated from 1779 to 1815 with 

 signal industry and success by the physician Olbers, who, besides 

 discovering several of the asteroids, published an improved method 

 of calculating the orbits of comets. During this period, Werner, 

 in Germany, and Pallas, in Russia, made many important contri- 

 butions to geological science. By the publication, in 1774, of his 

 short but very remarkable " Treatise on the Characters of Minerals," 

 Werner accomplished for the terminology of mineralogy what the 

 " Philosophia Botanica" of Linnasus had done for that of botany 

 nearly a quarter of a century before. Moreover, his celebrated 

 ' Classification and Description of Mountains," which appeared in 




15 



nSY, did much to give to geology the rank of a positive science. 

 In the mountain ranges of Siberia, Pallas discovered the general 

 law of the succession of the granitic, schistose, and calcareous 

 rocks — a discovery which has given birth, as Cuvier affirms, to 

 all modern geology. In 1808 Berzelius, b}' the publication of his 

 admirable " System of Chemistry," greatly enlarged the bounda- 

 ries of chemical science. His vast analytical labors did much to 

 place the atomic theory upon a sure foundation. In Italy, near 

 the close of the last centur}', electrical science was measurably pro- 

 moted by the labors of Galvaui and Yolta. The former, in 1791, 

 made known his curious researches upon the influence of electri- 

 city upon muscular motion ; while the latter, about the same time, 

 invented his well-known electric pile, by which he showed that a 

 disturbance of electrical equilibrium was produced bj' the mere 

 contact of different bodies, and that the electrical current circu- 

 lated in one constant direction through a circuit composed of dif- 

 ferent conductors. Between 1753 and 1812, anatoni}', physiolog}^ 

 and general natural history were cultivated with much success in 

 Europe by Linnaeus, Pallas, Spallanzani, Camper, Blumenbach, 

 Felix d'Azara, and others. In addition to his " System of Na- 

 ture," " Botanical Philosoph}-," and other valuable contributions 

 to the literature of botanical science, Linnreus, in 1753, published 

 the " Species Plantarum," in which, for the first time, was adopted 

 the happy idea of distinguishing species by adding a simple de- 

 scriptive word to the generic term. Camper and Blumenbach, in 

 addition to their other labors, cultivated ethnology with much 

 zeal. Blumenbach, especiall}', by the publication of his " Decades 

 Craniorum," laid the foundation of the science of human cranio- 

 graphy. It was during the great scientific epoch now under review 

 that the illustrious Humboldt entered upon his wonderful career 

 of extensive travel and varied scientific research. In the ten 

 years immediatel}' preceding the founding of the Academy, he had 

 already published valuable works on the physical geograph}', geo- 

 logy, zoology, comparative anatomy, and ethnology' of the northern 

 partof South AmcricaandMexico, together with important mouioirs 

 on the astronomical observations and baromct»ic measurements 

 made b}' him in conjunction with his fellow-traveller, Bonpland, 

 during their five years' ex[)loration of little-known regions of the 

 New World. These works, together with the " Aspects of Nature," 

 which first appeared in 1808, did more, perhaps, than the writings 




16 



of any other scientist of that period to call attention to the study 

 of natural phenomena. 



Such, briefl}', was the scientific outlook in Europe at the close 

 of the first decade of the nineteenth century. What was the con- 

 dition of science at that time in the Xew World? Meagre indeed. 

 Franklin, that " mighty genius," as Mirabeau styled him, had 

 been resting in his grave full twenty -two j^ears when our Academy 

 ■was born, and science in Philadelphia — I may say in America — 

 lay sleeping with him. From the time that he had experimentally 

 identified lightning with the electric fluid no great scientific dis- 

 covery had been made in the United States. The American 

 Philosophical Society, which he was instrumental in creating, 

 had been in existence forty-three years, and had published in all 

 that time but six volumes of its Transactions. The College of 

 Physicians, founded in 1T8Y, had issued, in 1793, the first and, up 

 to 1812, the only volume of its publications. In addition to these 

 institutions, two medical societies of but little importance, one 

 botanical association known as the Linntean Society, the Philadel- 

 phia, Loganian, and Friends' Libraries, with two small circulating 

 libraries, were the only available aids to the literary and scientific 

 • student. Strictly scientific works were scarce, and scientific men 

 but few in number. Between 1139 and 1803, James Logan, Dr. 

 John Cla3^ton, John and William Bartram, and Dr. Benjamin S. 

 Barton had published various more or less valuable works on 

 botany. The celebrated David Rittenhouse, whom Renwick, his 

 biographer, pronounced as " second to Franklin alone in point of 

 scientific merit, and the equal, in point of learning and skill, as an 

 observer, to any practical astronomer then living," had, some years 

 prior to his death, in 1796, contributed man}'- valuable papers on 

 astronomical, philosophical, and mathematical subjects to the 

 early volumes of the Transactions of the American Philosophical 

 Society. In a later volume of these Transactions, Mr. Maclure, 

 who has been called the pioneer of American geolog}-, published 

 an account of a geological survey of the United States made by 

 himself in 1809. In ornithology a new era ma}'^ justly be said to 

 have been established in 1808 by the publication of the first 

 volume of Alexander Wilson's magnificent work on American 

 birds, the fifth and sixth volumes of which appeared in 1812. 



The mass of the people of Philadelphia were then, as they are 

 now, but little interested in pureh" scientific studies. The few 




17 



persons who directed their attention to such inquiries, having 

 neither cabinets nor books in the special departments of natural 

 science at their command, were forced to contend with many diffi- 

 culties. 



Amidst such inauspicious surroundings, and upon the eve of a 

 ■war with Great Britain, the founders of the Academy began their 

 great work, which, long ago, would have perished in the bud, had 

 it not been for the important princijiles involved in the attempt. 

 For it often happens in the affairs of men that the importance of 

 the objects to be accomplished gives to the efforts made in their 

 behalf a degree of perseverance which becomes the guarantee of 

 ultimate success. 



Did the time permit, T would fain dwell upon tlie trials and dilli- 

 culties experienced hy the resolute men whose labors we this da^* 

 commemorate. I might interest 3'ou with details of their earl}' 

 meetings held at Mr. Speakman's residence, and of the subsequent 

 sittings which took place at the house known to the citizens of 

 that day as " Mercer's cake shop," where the title, " Academy- of 

 Natural Sciences," was first adopted ; I might describe to you the 

 little room over the milliner's shop in Second, near Race Street, 

 in which the present magnificent museum and lil)rary of the Aca- 

 demj- were begun by the donation of books and dried plants, a 

 few stuffed birds, some shells and insects, and a handful of arti- 

 ficial crystals, all presented b}' the members themselves ; I might 

 tell you how, as the museum increased, it was found necessary' to 

 move it to the larger accommodations afforded b}' a house in the 

 neighborhood ; how a collection of minerals was purchased for 

 the Academy by Mr. Speakman, who advanced the money from 

 his own private means; how public lectures were delivered on 

 mineralogy by Dr. Troost, on entbmologj' b}' Mr. Say, and on 

 botany by Drs. "Waterhouse and Barnes, to large audiences of 

 ladies and gentlemen; how, in July, 1815, the cabinet and library, 

 now considerably increased, were moved to a building exjjressly 

 erected for them on a vacant lot in the rear of Mr. Gillianis's resi- 

 dence on Arch Street; how the war with Great Britain whicii 

 broke out in 1812, and continued during the first three years of 

 the society's existence, interfered very seriously with its progress 

 Ity interrupting, to a considerable extent, intercourse with Kuropc, 

 and thus almost entirely preventing the importation of much- 

 needed scientific books; how several of the meml.iers were drawn 

 2 




18 



away from their quiet pursuits to act as volunteers in defence of 

 the city ; and how, finally, notwithstanding the zealous efforts 

 that had been made to advance the interests of the Academ}'^ and 

 obtain for it the public support it deserved, the list of its members 

 at the end of three years contained but twenty-five names. In 

 1820 the society numbered one hundred members and one hundred 

 and ninety correspondents, and began, for the first time in its 

 career, to be favorably recognized by the cultivators of natural 

 knowledge in Europe as well as America. The lot and building 

 at the southeast corner of Twelfth and Sansom streets having 

 been purchased with funds supplied by Mr. Maclure and other 

 members, the Academy moved to this locality in Ma}'-, 1826. 

 Thirteen years afterwards the collections had increased so much as 

 to require still laiger space for their accommodation. Accordingly, 

 the present site at the southwest corner of Broad and Sansom 

 Streets was secured, and a large and commodious edifice erected 

 through the munificence mainly of its large-hearted president, the 

 late Mr. William Maclure. The building was enlarged in 1847, at 

 the expense of another benefactor of the Academy, the late Dr. 

 Thomas B. Wilson ; and again in 1855, by means of a fund raised 

 by subscription among the members and their friends. In this 

 building the sessions of the Academy have been held for the last 

 thirty-two years, during which time its utility as an educational 

 institution, and as a centre of scientific research, has been steadily 

 increasing. 



Thus slowly and laboriously advancing, encountering many ob- 

 stacles, now succumbing to them and anon overcoming them, 

 constantly embarrassed by the want of funds, deriving no assist- 

 ance from either the State or municipal government, except ex- 

 emption from taxation, and obtaining but little aid outside of the 

 immediate circle of its members, the Academy, after the lapse of 

 little more than half a century, has become famous in the great 

 republic of science, has achieved an enviable reputation not only 

 in this country, but in the Old World, as a chief focus of scientific 

 activity in the United States. As such, as the champion of edu- 

 cation of a special kind, as the earnest promoter of natural knowl- 

 edge, it deserves the respect and heart}'' support of the citizens of 

 Philadelphia. 



Listen, I pray you, to what the society has been able by its own 




19 



unassisted efforts, to accomplish in the brief period comprised 

 within the limits of a single human life. 



It has gathered into its museum more than 400,000 specimens 

 of natural histor}^, many of them unique, and not to be replaced b}' 

 any expenditure of mone}', time, or labor. It has created a grand 

 library, containing nearly 23,000 volumes, many of which are not 

 to be found in any other library in the United States. Of some 

 of them duplicates cannot be procured at any price. This library, 

 which is one of reference exclusivel}', is of incalculable value to 

 men of science in this countr}-. It is constantly consulted not 

 only by persons residing in this cit}-, but also by students from 

 all parts of the United States ; not only by its own members, but 

 by man}' others engaged in scientific research ; for the societ}', 

 true to the principles of its founders, true to their desire to diffuse 

 knowledge as much as possible, has never refused permission to 

 any respectable persons to consult its treasures freely. 



The Academ}-, earl^- recognizing the importance of contributing 

 to the common stock of knowledge an3' discoveries in natural 

 science made by its members, issued, in Ma}'', 1817, the first num- 

 ber of a journal of its transactions. The first series of this jour- 

 nal terminated in 1842, and consisted of 8 octavo volumes, of 

 2912 pages, containing 23Y papers contributed by 56 authors, and 

 illustrated b}' 161 plates. In 1841 another publication known as 

 the " Proceedings," was commenced. Up to the present time, 22 

 volumes, each averaging 400 pages, and containing the verbal, 

 and manj' of the written, communications made at the meetings 

 of the society, have been published. In 1847 a second series of 

 the " Journal" was begun in quarto form. Seven volumes of 2820 

 pages in the aggregate, and containing 116 articles, contributed 

 by 50 authors, and illustrated by 318 well-executed lithographic 

 plates, have appeared. In 1865 the Academy, through its con- 

 chological section, commenced the publication of another serial, 

 the "American Journal of Conchology." Of this, seven volumes 

 have been issued, containing in the aggregate 2500 pages of 

 printed matter, illustrated by 150 plates, many of them colored, 

 besides about 1000 wood engravings. These publications are ex- 

 changed with about 200 scientific and pliilosophical institutions 

 located in the United States and South America, in Europe, Asia, 

 and Liberia. While serving as a medium for the dissemination 

 of a large amount of technical knowledge hitherto unknown or 




20 



uurecorded, they have acquired for the Academ}- and its students, 

 a world-wide reputation, and, b}' giving to Philadelphia a definite 

 scientific character and position, have enhanced our national re- 

 spectability abroad. They have shown that our city has its repre- 

 sentatives of mind as well as of wealth, that it is alive to the 

 intellectual as well as the material needs of mankind. 



The beneficial eflTorts of the Academy' have not been confined 

 to the collection of books and specimens and the publication of 

 learned papers. It has, also, as its archives show, aided, both by 

 judicious counsel and pecuniary means, many scientific expedi- 

 tions, whether projected under the patronage of government or 

 conducted by private individuals. In this way it has assisted in 

 developing the topography, meteorology, natural history, and 

 ethnology of many parts of this country, of the islands of the 

 South Sea, of the frozen Polar zone, and the burning African land. 

 By means of a sum of mone}^ annnalh^ donated by the children 

 of the late Augustus E. Jessup, for many years a member of the 

 Academy, it has supported a number of young men while devoting 

 their time and energies to the acquisition of a practical knowledge 

 of the natural sciences. 



To bring together the appliances necessar}' for scientific study, 

 to give to the world the important results of its toilsome, pro- 

 tracted, and self-den3ing labors, to aid in their researches those 

 who have given evidence that they possess the rare ability and 

 the willingness to become the interpreters of nature, to inculcate 

 a taste among the people generally for the natural sciences by 

 exhibiting its rich collections for many years, without charge — 

 such has been the work of the Academ}^, such its noble mission. 



When we reflect that the institution is supported entirely by 

 donations and the annual contributions of its members, very few 

 of whom possess large means ; when we consider that since its 

 formation not more than five hundred citizens of Philadelphia 

 have enrolled themselves in the list of its members ; when we re- 

 call the fact that it possesses no estate yielding revenue, that for 

 manj^ 3'ears it struggled under the burden of a heavy mortgage 

 upon its building, and that, until this debt was extinguished in 

 1859, by the generous act of Dr. Wilson, its legitimate income was 

 not more than sufficient to defray its current expenses ; and when 

 we remember that the classing, labelling, and arranging of the 

 specimens have voluntarily been done by a few of the members, 




21 



the most of whom have been able to give to this work and to theii- 

 studies onl3^ the leisure moments snatched from their daily voca- 

 tions, we ma}- well be astonished at the results it has accomplished 

 — results which compare favorably in many respects with those 

 achieved by similar institutions, which for many 3-ears have been 

 sustained bj' the kingly governments of Europe. By fostering 

 science it has proven itself a benefactor of mankind. For the 

 labors of scientific men, though often but little heeded when first 

 promulgated, or looked upon as curious, and, it ma}' be, as use- 

 less speculations, are reall}- not lifeless germs. Like seed fallen 

 by the wayside, though neglected for a while, they nevertheless 

 spring up in due time and blossom and bear fruit ; like the tiny 

 brooks which feed the mighty river ui)on whose bosom the com- 

 merce of a great nation is ultimately to be borne, they find, at 

 length, a marvellous expression in the practical affairs of every-day 

 life. 



To appreciate properly the efforts of the Academy we should 

 contemplate for a moment what science has done for mankind, 

 especially during the last sixty years. 



Look for a moment at savage man, who finds in his material 

 wants, the first incentive to the emplo3'raent of his powers of ob- 

 servation in the acquisition of natural knowledge. Inferior to 

 many of the lower animals in the keenness of his senses, he has, 

 vastly more than they, felt tiie pressure of the external world upon 

 him. The necessity of obtaining subsistence, providing shelter 

 against the weather, and means of defence against his enemies, 

 arouses liis dormant intellectual energies. He begins to observe 

 how sunshine, rain, and wind atlect the growtii of the plants 

 around liim, especiall}' those supplying him with a portion of his 

 daily food; how the germinating seed is developed into a plant; 

 how the i)lant blossoms and bears fruit. He learns to distinguish 

 nutritive from poisonous plants, observes the effects of fire and of 

 natural forces, scans the starry heavens with eyes brimful of 

 superstitious wonder, and learns at length to couple the motions 

 of the heavenly bodies with the ever-recurring changes of the sea- 

 sons. Thus, face to face with the unalterabU- lacts, the inexorable 

 laws of nature, his reason enters feebly upon that career of iiniuiry 

 which, though its immediate and pressing object is simply the 

 amelioration of his ph^'sical condition, is destined, after long ages, 

 to place him in possession of Iho-jc classified groups of facts and 




22 



principles which we denominate mathematics, physics, chemistiy, 

 geology, botan}', biology, social, political, and moral science. 



Science, thus created, has rescued savage man from the bond- 

 age of ignorance and gross superstition, and, by giving him com- 

 mand over the primal forces of nature, has elevated him in the 

 economic, social, and moral scale. It has benefited him by im- 

 proving agriculture, developing and utilizing the staples of com- 

 merce, and increasing and cheapening the means of transportation. 

 It has bridged the ocean and made its waves a means of convey- 

 ance from one hemisphere to the other, thus bringing distant 

 nations face to face, as it were, and enabling them to exchange 

 their handicrafts quickly and profitably. It has thrown huge 

 bridges — wonders of engineering skill — over impassable rivers, 

 and covered the earth with an endless net-work of railway's. The 

 classic fable of Mercury, cast from Olympus, becoming the mes- 

 senger of the gods, it has practically realized by drawing from 

 heaven the electric fluid and compelling it to act as the letter- 

 carrier of man along thousands of miles of telegraphic wire. Nay, 

 mirabile dictu, it has bound together the two hemispheres with 

 might}'' submarine cables, along which our scientific Hermes speeds 

 with his letter-bags at the rate of 19,000 miles in a second of time. 

 It has introduced, as motive power, thousands of steam-engines 

 into mills, mines, and factories, with the most extraordinary in- 

 dustrial and financial results. By inventing a multiplicitj'' of 

 apparatus for accomplishing, in a simple and effective manner, a 

 great — I had almost said an endless — variety of purposes, it has 

 increased the facilities of production, simplified and cheapened 

 many manufactures, remodelled the arts, and made labor so easy 

 and rapid that it is now possible to perform an amount of work 

 which no combined manual effort could hope to accomplish. Con- 

 stantl}'- discovering new raw materials, it is constantl}' adapting 

 them to the material wants of life. It has taught us to bleach and 

 to dye, to spin and to weave, to decompose and recombine, and in 

 various waj^s to modify and to call into existence the hidden, use- 

 ful properties of the numberless substances that nature gives to 

 man for his convenience and comfort. It teaches us how to irri- 

 gate and manure barren soils into fruitful fields, how to transform 

 the wild currant into the sweet grape, how to convert its juice 

 into wine, and this into ether ; how to transform a caterpillar into 

 a silk-worm, and to weave into velvet the silk which it spins. 




23 



Diving into the bowels of the earth, it brings forth coal and iron. 

 From the former it distils, on the one hand, a brilliant light, and, 

 on the other, a magnificent series of dyes rivalling in gorgeousncss 

 the colors of Tyre. The latter it converts into steel, and forges 

 this into bars, and even, as if to show its amazing dexterity, ham- 

 mers it into laminffi rivalling the leaves of a book in thinness and 

 flexibility. It bleaches rags to whiteness, and gives to the calico- 

 printer indigo and ultramarine dyes. From refuse soap-suds it 

 reclaims important fatty matters ; from the leaflet of the pine tree 

 it obtains cloth capable of being woven into various articles of 

 dress. It has transformed pulverized bones and the sewage of 

 cities into manure, the refuse of the gas-works into ammonia, ether, 

 and flavoring extracts ; and old rags into clothing, paper, and 

 many ornamental articles. 



But the acquisition of natural knowledge, while adding directly' 

 to the resources of our material civilization, has conferred upon 

 man practical benefits of another character. The proper applica- 

 tion of our advanced knowledge of the laws and conditions of life, 

 both in health and disease, has done much not only to mitigate 

 individual sufiering and to prolong individual life, but it has also 

 enabled whole communities to protect themselves, more eflectually 

 than in former years, from the ravages of epidemic disease. 



Though often foot-sore and weary in this long and solemn 

 march called the progress of science, though often ])ruised and 

 broken in his struggles with a stern and unrelenting nature, man 

 at length rises to the realization of the fact that he cannot live by 

 bread alone. His mental elibrts, directed to the improvement of 

 his material condition, have given rise to intellectual wants, to the 

 irrepressible desire to understand the mystery- of nature, to know, 

 in the language of Goethe's " Faust :" — 



" To know what tho world contains 

 In its innonnost heart and finer veins, 

 To see all its energies and seeds, 

 And deal no more in words but in deeds." 



Perplexed and amazed in the midst of the knowledge which he 

 has so laboriously wrested from rock and tree, from river and cloud, 

 he obstinately questions the universe about liim, interrogates the 

 consciousness within him as to the meaning of creation, the sig- 

 nificance and purpose of ni;in in tlu' order of that creation, whence 




24 



he comes and whither he goes. To nature he says, in the -svords 



of Shelley's " Alastor," 



"I have loved 

 Thee ever and thee only ; I have ■\\'atched 

 Thy shadow, and the darkness of thy steps, 

 And my heart ever gazes on the depths 

 Of thj" deep mysteries. I have made my bed 

 In charnels and on coffins, where black Death 

 Keeps record of the trophies won from thee ; 

 Hoping to still these obstinate questionings 

 Of thee and thine." 



But these questionings, these yearnings of the soul, meet witii 

 a vague and evasive response. Loving the light and seeking it, 

 the student of nature comes out of the search baffled and sad, but 

 not discouraged. In his attempts to penetrate the outward sem- 

 blance of the numberless objects that engross his attention, and 

 attain the inner and hidden meaning, he finds himself suddenly 

 confronted with the unknown and the unknowable, discovers im- 

 perfections in his knowledge that cannot be remedied, and feels 

 that the aspirations of his soul cannot be realized. Be3-ond the 

 sensual plienomena of nature, behind this veil of Isis, he beholds 

 forces which dreamil}- waver before him, and which contiuualh- 

 elude his eager grasp. Thus he awakens to a painful conscious- 

 ness of the limitation of his faculties, and to the recognition of a 

 Power vastl}^ superior to himself — a Power " past finding out." 

 In this consciousness, and in the feelings of helplessness and de- 

 pendence engendered b}^ it, lies the germ of the religious idea — 

 the essence of natural religion. Thus out of the philosophy of 

 nature is evolved the philosophy of spirit, as the flower is developed 

 from the stem. Though unable to grasp the secret idea of nature, 

 though unable to understand the reason and the object of the 

 eternal and infinite play of matter and force around him, he, 

 nevertheless, constantly rises in his pursuit of natural knowledge 

 to grander and still grander conceptions of the universe, to more 

 and more philosophical views of himself as part of that universe. 

 He rises to the recognition of fixed order and immutable law in 

 the moral as well as in the intellectual and phj^sical worlds. He 

 fashions for himself a new morality, based upon a more exact 

 acquaintance witla the laws of his organization and his relations 

 to the animate and inanimate nature about him. 




Tlirough the earnest and untiring efforts of its members, aided 

 by the Avise munificence of man}' generous patrons of science in 

 this city, the Academy is to-day enabled to lay the corner-stone 

 of a larger edifice, and thus to inaugurate a new and still brighter 

 era in its existence. Assisted b}' the liberal and continued sup- 

 port of the citizens of Philadelphia, it is destined, in its efforts to 

 promote and popularize knowledge, to become more than ever the 

 l^ioneer of advanced science, more than ever a great school for the 

 higher culture of the mind, more than ever the exponent of that 

 intellectual revolution which is, at the present time, slowly but 

 surely changing the aspect of societ}'. 



Professor H. C. Wood, Jr., M.D., of the University of Pennsyl- 

 vania, was introduced, and delivered the following address : — 



Ladies and Gentlemen : Standing here to-day on this platform 

 in presence of some of my masters in science, there comes upon 

 me a flood of reminiscences from the past, and in the uncertain 

 twilight of the future I seem to see a vision fair and fruitful, 

 though misty and uncertain in its outline. 



The tinj* doors which close the cells where memories sleep arc 

 flung wide open, and scenes of the long-ago come upon me as 

 sharp and clear as though in the light of the present. It seems 

 but yesterda}', when, a lad of some ten summers, leading my little 

 brother by the hand, with eager, anxious heart, I rang the front- 

 door bell of a house in Arch Street, near Fourth, and asked for 

 one of those who now sit upon this jilatform. Well do I remember 

 the disappointment of the final answer to my entreaties that I was 

 too young to be given tickets to the Acadcnw of Xatural Sciences. 

 Childish griefs and cliildish J03's, though they seem to us trifles 

 light as air, are 3'et real as life, and the impression of the choking 

 disappointment of that hour time will not efface. 



Again I see myself, now in advancing youth, armed with a letter 

 of introduction, ascending the steps of a modest dwelling in 

 Sansom Street, wondering, as I ring, how strange it is that so 

 great a man should live in so small a house. Little then did I 

 know the truth of tlie saying of the prose poet, Ruskin, '' That the 

 world pays least for its best work." 



The word of the master of the little house had, howcviM'. power 

 enough to unlock that chamber of mysteries of my childish fancy, 




26 



the Library of the Aeaclemj', and, astonished, in my joy, I roamed 

 at will and fastened as I wished on the books that crowned the 

 walls. But another step was wanted. I could not. handle the 

 rare treasures locked in the museum cases. I could but flatten 

 my nose against the panes in my efforts to see the specimens. 

 One auspicious morn, however, the keys were given me, and now 

 at last I could touch and handle and taste to my heart's content. 

 It seemed as though the veritable keys of knowledge had been 

 put in my possession, and I had but to walk in and pluck the 

 golden fruits of the orchard. 



There comes to me to-day also a vision of the future. I see no 

 longer the homely face of the old Academy, beautified by the 

 thoughts of its usefulness and by the glamour of old association. 

 A new building rises before me, higher and wider in its scope, 

 grander and nobler in its architecture, than the old building that 

 we love, but yet cold and barren in its very newness. 



It is to realize this vision that we are here to-day. It is to 

 witness the first beginning of the new life of our loved institution 

 that we are assembled. The trustees, in their faith rather than 

 in their knowledge, in their weakness rather than in their strength, 

 have gone forward, and it rests with the citizens of Philadelphia 

 to decide what measure of success shall crown tlieir efforts. 



I know that there are some who see but little value in the study 

 of natural science ; who in their folly cry out Cui bono ? With 

 such to-day I will not pause to reason ; if the noonday blaze of 

 this the nineteenth century cannot penetrate the thickness of their 

 intellectual darkness and prejudice, what could the rushlight of 

 my best efforts do ? I can only say with reverent feeling, God 

 pity the man and God help the nation that, blinded by its avarice 

 for present material gain, can see no place for the quiet student 

 of God's work. 



See yon orchard, with its golden fruit of plenty. Could it be 

 foreseen, or did the little rootlet know, that, working so silently 

 and yet so faithfully in the darkness under ground, it was prepar- 

 ing for such a bounteous harvest ? So it is with the scholar in 

 his quiet room; in his most abstruse and apparently most profit- 

 less study, he is gathering the knowledge, the power, that per- 

 haps other men shall ripen into the richest material fruit. 



There has been made recently, in this city, and indeed there is 

 still being made, an effort to put the University of Pennsylvania 




27 



on a wider footing. Far be it from us to-day to dampen the ardor 

 or throw aught in the wa}' of those who are carrying out this 

 work ; but none the less is it true that there is a culture deeper, 

 higher, and more profound than any university can give. 



This is the self-culture of the true scholar, for which a university 

 at best can but laj- the foundation. The highest culture must be 

 forever self-culture. A man may be aided by others up to a cer- 

 tain point ; into the unknown he must travel alone. Aye, more 

 than this, before he reaches that unknown he must for himself 

 trace out the obscure, unfrequented paths which mark the out- 

 lying regions of uncertainty in knowledge. 



It is to afford opportunity for this self-culture that the Academy 

 exists. There are but few men whom destiii}' has marked for such 

 a course. The study halls of the Academy must alwaj^s be for 

 the few — but the work of the few is the life of the nation. I 

 must assert, then, the pre-eminent claims for such institutions as 

 our Academy. Talk of your universities — of the large crowds 

 that haunt their doors — of the annual overflow of viijorous trained 

 young talent wherewith thej'' bless surrounding regions. Why, 

 our old Academy is the g^-mnasium in which men train themselves 

 for professorships in the universities. 



There is a class of medical men who, in their earl}- professional 

 life, study deepl}^ the natural sciences, and who often through 

 life add to the practical duties of their profession investigations of 

 natural history. I do not remember a single great name of such 

 a character in Continental Europe. Yet in the British Islands, 

 the brightest lights of the profession — the Hunters, Coopers, 

 Brodies, Reids, Bells,'Beales, Pagets, etc. — the foremost medical 

 thinkers, leaders, and practitioners of tlieir days, have been of 

 this character — students of natural history who have applied the 

 methods and facts of their sister science to their profession, and 

 thereb}'' dimljed to their proud pre-eminence. In our own c-it}- the 

 names of Rush, Morton, Harlan, Wood, and some about us, 

 mark our origin. And, indeed, it is chiefly tli rough such men 

 that the great renown of our city, as a medical centre, was ac- 

 quired. Speaking for this class of men, I wouhl sa^' to the citi- 

 zens of Philadelphia, as the}' value the fair name of their city ; as 

 tlicy respect and honor that profession into whose keeping they 

 place all that is dearest to them; as they hope for skilful rescue 




28 



when life is in peril, to see to it that men of this character are not 

 deprived of tlieir opportunities for culture and growth. 



For myself, I wish to say to-da}-, that whatever of value I may 

 have achieved in the past, or whatever of value, little or great, I 

 ma}' achieve in the future, as a medical investigator, is largely due 

 to the lessons of close observation, of patient comparison, of cau- 

 tious deductions, learnt in the close aisles and dust}' b3'-rooms of 

 the old Academy' — the only institution which I ever have or ever 

 ■will claim as my Alma Mater — the veritable mother of m}- intel- 

 lectual life. 



A few weeks before the lamented Pi'ofessor Frazer's death, a 

 prominent business man of this citj'told me that he called on him 

 in reference to a grandson who rebelled against learning Greek or 



Latin. Mr. asked the Professor, " Is there anj^ use in his 



learning these things ?" " Where is he to live V was the reply. " In 

 Philadelphia." "Ah, in Philadelphia ! Wh^', then it makes little 

 difference whether he is an ignoramus or not." 



There was deep truth in the Professor's sarcasm. It has seemed 

 in the past as though our cit}' was vrilling to settle down to be the 

 far-famed paradise of mediocrit}'^ — a dead level, unbroken alike by 

 abysses of gross ignorance or masses of high culture. 



There has, however, come into this old city of ours, I am most 

 happy to believe, a new life. Arousing herself from her lethargy 

 of years, like a giant refreshed b}' sleep, she is marching forward 

 in all iier interests; stretching out the arms of her commerce to 

 grasp at once the Occident and the Orient, pouring forth from 

 multitudinous workshops products of a continent, sending her 

 sons to drag out the untold treasures of the neighboring moun- 

 tains, she is multiplying her wealth with almost magical rapidity. 

 Her educational interests, awakened by the hum of universal labor, 

 are forgetting their feeble steps in this the da^'' of their rejuvena- 

 tion, and it's well that our cherished institution now steps forward 

 to the changing music of the times. 



Not long since there came to a neighboring city a man of 3'ears 

 and said to its citizens : I have nothing to give but my time and 

 my reputation, but if you will find me the means I will found a 

 museum that shall far eclipse the famous Academy of Natural 

 Sciences of Philadelphia ; and the citizens of that cit}', scarcely' a 

 third the size of ours, gave him $.362,000, and the legislature of a 

 State scarcely as large as a corner of Pennsylvania gave him 




29 



$190,000, aud the museum is arising iu grand proportions, and 

 the fame of it is filling the whole earth. To-day we come before 

 the citizens of Philadelphia not with emptj' hands. With a librarj-, 

 with a collection that it would take half a million of dollars to 

 gather up ; with funds sufficient for future support, this institu- 

 tion only asks a habitation — -a house in which it may display its 

 riches. 



Trustees of the Building Fund of the Academy of Natural 

 Sciences, we labor, it is true, under that strange curse which seems 

 rooted in the very groundwork of human nature. We are no 

 citizens of a foreign land. We are but prophets without honor in 

 our own countr}'. And 3'et I say, go forward. 



Only with faith and vigor let us work, and it must be that suc- 

 cess will crown our enterprise ; that ere long we shall raise our 

 jal)ilant voices under roofed arch tree, in spacious halls and 

 lighted galleries — voices jubilant for labor past, for good works 

 done, for hopes extinguished in fruition. 



Dr. Ruschenberger then laid the corner-stone, depositing in it 

 copies of the daily papers of the cit}', papers relating to the his- 

 tory of the Academ}', the by-laws of the Academy, and the num- 

 ber of the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of 

 Philadelphia last published. 



Rev. Dr. Boardman delivered a prayer, after which the assem- 

 blage dispersed.
