A CONTKIBUTION TO THE COMPARATIVE MORPHOLOGY OF THE THORACIC 



SCLERITES OF INSECTS. 



BY G. C. CRAMPTON, PH.D. 



Although the thoracic sclerites are much used factors in insect 

 classification and myology, there exists a most confusing lack of 

 uniformity in the homologizing and terminology employed by the 

 various writers upon these subjects. This confusion, it would appear 

 has largely arisen from the fact that each investigator has been con- 

 tent to confine his attention to one or two groups of insects, applying 

 his own terminology as occasion arose, or, more frequently, naming 

 the sclerites without sufficient comparison with intermediate forms 

 to determine their true homologies. 



As would be naturally expected, many new and important points 

 have been brought to light in each of the orders, but they stand as 

 isolated facts, rather than as generalities applying to the Hexapoda 

 as a whole. It is with the purpose of applying this knowledge to 

 insects in general that a comparative morphological study has been 

 here attempted. 



Material. 



The insects for study were collected in the United States, Europe 

 and North Africa. With these I was able, through the kindness of 

 Prof. R. Heymons, to compare a number of rare specimens in the 

 Berlin Museum, not otherwise accessible. However, in so far as was 

 possible, the commonest insects have been chosen to illustrate the 

 types discussed, in order that any one wishing to verify the results 

 might have no difficulty in procuring the necessary material. 



Technique. 



The binocular microscope was found indispensable to the perform- 

 ing of dissections, which were always made and studied under a 

 liquid medium, the rays of an artificial light being concentrated upon 

 the object by means of a bull's-eye condenser. Glycerine or oil proved 

 to be the most favorable medium for the examining of small objects, 

 since they more readily remain in the position in which they are placed , 

 when a denser medium is used. 




4 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



In studying the musculature to determine the homology of the 

 sclerites, the so-called "Halbierungs methode" was largely employed. 

 Usually a series of dissections was prepared, in each case an additional 

 layer of muscles being removed, beginning at the mesal surface of 

 the bisected insect. The preparations thus made were fastened upon 

 thin strips of mica, by means of photoxylin, and preserved in 80% 

 alcohol. Since both mica and photoxylin are transparent, the speci- 

 men may thus be easily studied from either side. 



Only in the case of very small insects, or when it was difficult to 

 follow the course of certain muscles, was it necessary to have recourse 

 to reconstructions from microtome sections. 



In dealing with strongly chitinized material, good preparations 

 could be obtained only by the celloidin-paraffin embedding method, 

 and even then it was frequently necessary to paint the upper face of 

 the block with a thin film of mastix collodion before cutting each 

 section. 



For general purposes, staining with Grenadier's haemotoxylin, 

 differentiating with picric acid, and counterstaining with eosin gave 

 good results. 



Literature. 



The works of Swammerdam, Linne, and all authors before Illiger's 

 time have but little interest other than from an historic point of view. 

 On the other hand such of the later publications as those of Chabrier, 

 '20; Strauss-Diirkheim, '28; Kirby and Spence, '28; Westwood, '39; 

 Burmeister, '32, etc., although very thorough and painstaking, are 

 too confusingly varied in their homologizing and terminology to have 

 •any very great practical worth. 



The most scientific handling of the subject is to be found in the 

 work of Audouin, '24, upon whose researches the modern terminology 

 is based. Since the appearance of this article, but little has been 

 added to our knowledge of the comparative morphology of the thorax. 



Of the more modern publications the following were found very 

 useful in the preparation of this paper: For the homologizing of the 

 sclerites, Kleuker, '83; Kolbe, '93; Brauer, '88; Amans, '85; Borner, 

 '03; Verhoeff, '03; Janet, '98; Comstock, '02; Walton, '00, and Voss, 

 '04. For the terminology of the musculature, Luks, '83; Petri, '99; 

 Breed, '03 ; Voss, '04, and Durken, '07. For the wing venation, Adolph, 

 '80; Redtenbacher, '86; Comstock, '98, and MacGillivray, '06. 



Such of the works as are of a more particular interest will be dis- 

 cussed under those headings to which they especially refer.

Terminology. 



The modern terminology for the thoracic sclerites is based upon the 

 epoch-making work of Audouin, '20. Discarding the then prevalent 

 conception of a binary division of the thorax according to the function 

 ©f its organs of locomotion (as, for example, the collum and pectus of 

 Knoch, 1801, the corselet and segment alifere of Chabrier, '20, or the 

 mani- and ali-truncus of Kirby, '28) this author demonstrated that 

 the thorax is composed of three similar segments. These three he 

 designated as the pro-, meso-, and meta-thorax — terms variously 

 attributed to Kirby, Latreille and Audouin, but which appear to have 

 been first proposed by Nitzsch, '18. Nitzsch, however, used the 

 slightly different form protothorax instead of prothorax. 



Each segment Audouin considered as composed of four regions, 

 namely, a dorsal region or tergum, two flanks or "pleurae," and a 

 ventral region called the sternum. The sternum he regarded as con- 

 sisting of a single piece, but for the flanks and tergum he described a 

 number of subdivisions. 



In the flank or "pleura," he recognized the following parts: two 

 large lateral plates, the anterior of which he termed the episternum, 

 and the posterior the epimeron; a narrow strip along the anterior 

 margin of the episternum called the parapleuron ; a small plate con- 

 taining the spiracle, called the peritreme; and a triangular sclerite 

 articulating with the coxa, called the trochantine. 



The tergum he considered as composed of four regions, lying one 

 behind the other. Beginning with the most anterior he termed these 

 the prsescutum, scutum, scutellum and postscutellum. 



Some entomologists employ the word dorsum to designate the tergal 

 region of a single segment, but it is far preferable, as Audouin has 

 done, to apply this term to the whole dorsal surface of the insect. 



The expression stigma is frequently used as synonymous with spir- 

 acle, especially in the German publications; but, as used by system- 

 atists, the word stigma denotes the chitinized cell in the costal region 

 of the wings of certain Hymenoptera, etc. It would, therefore, be 

 preferable to use only the more exact and suitable term spiracle to 

 denote the tracheal opening. 



In most of the modern works there is a very great laxity in the use 

 of the singular and the plural form of the word pleura. For example, 

 some authors speak of one flank as the pleuron and both together as 

 the pleura, while others, following Audouin's example, choose the 

 latinized forms pleura and pleurae. One cannot employ the term 

 pleura in both a singular and plural sense without creating confusion, 




6 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



and as the words are of Greek origin it would seem advisable to use 

 only the etymologically correct forms, pleuron and pleura. 



Recently the terms tergite, pleurite and sternite have been used 

 interchangeably with tergum, pleuron and sternum. One form of the 

 word appears to be amply sufficient for all ordinary purposes, and it 

 would be far more practical to use the term tergite for a subdivision 

 of the tergum, pleurite for a part of the pleuron, and sternite for a 

 sclerite of the sternum. Thus the prsescutum, scutum, etc., would 

 be tergites, the epimeron and episternum pleurites, and so on. It is 

 in this sense that these terms have been used in the text. 



Theoretical Discussion. 



Before taking up the subdivisions of the segments in detail, a brief 

 review of the theories dealing with the formation of the thorax will serve 

 to give a clearer idea of the nature of the sclerites. 



Despite Newport's, '39, statement to the contrary, Audouin seems 

 to have regarded the thorax as consisting of but three simple seg- 

 ments. MacLeay, '30, however, and after him Newport, '39, proposed 

 that each of the pro-, meso-, and meta-thoracic segments is in reality 

 composed of four subsegments or annuli, which have become more or 

 less completely fused together in the formation of the compact, highly 

 specialized thorax. The prsescutum, scutum, scutellum and post- 

 scutellum, according to this theory, are the tergal portions of the four 

 annuli, which are more closely fused in the pleural region and com- 

 pletely consolidated in the sternal region. 



Hagen, '89, on the other hand, holds the view that each segment is 

 composed not of four, but of three subsegments, each bearing a charac- 

 teristic appendage. The most anterior he terms the leg-bearing, the 

 next following the wing-bearing, and the last the spiracle-bearing 

 subsegment. 



The more modern theories are founded upon the work of Patten, 

 '90, who claims that the thoracic segments are composed of but two 

 annuli. From a comparison with the nervous system of Scolopendra, 

 which he takes as a type, he concludes that in all Anthropoda the 

 neuromeres, and consequently the segments themselves, are in reality 

 double. In support of this view, he states that "in all anthropods 

 carefully studied two cross commissures have been found in each 

 neuromere," thus indicating the double nature of these structures. 

 Furthermore, "in Acilius the median furrow between the cross com- 

 missures is similar to that found between the successive neuromeres." 

 "In Scorpio the neuromeres are distinctly double," and in such forms 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 7 



as Julus not only the neuromeres, but also the cardiac ostia, arteries, 

 tracheae and legs plainly show the double nature of the somites. Other 

 indications of segmental fusion are two pairs of tracheal invaginations 

 in each segment of Acilius, the bifurcated appendages of many Crus- 

 tacea, and the bifid maxillae of insects, in which latter group monsters 

 with double pairs of legs are of frequent occurrence. 



All of the subsequent theories, though differing greatly in their 

 point of view, lay great stress upon the fusion of segments traceable 

 in the Myriopoda as an indication of what has taken place in the 

 Hexapoda. 



Banks, '93, regards the suture between the episternum and epimeron 

 as the boundary between two leg-bearing subsegments. Of these, the 

 anterior or episternal subsegment, has retained its appendage fully 

 developed, while the leg of the posterior or epimeral subsegment 

 occurs only in a vestigial condition (the so-called styli found on the 

 meso-, and meta-thorax of Machilis and other insects) or is completely 

 fused with the episternal leg. 



Walton's, '00-01, theory differs from that of Banks only in the fact 

 that he regards the epimeral leg as represented by the so-called meron 

 or posterior portion of the coxa, and in that he believes that each sub- 

 segment originally bore a wing. According to this author, only the 

 epimeral wing is fully developed, while that of the episternal subseg- 

 ment exists only as a wing "fundament," and is represented by the 

 squamulae, tegulae, etc., designated under the common term pterygoda. 



Kolbe, '93, whose book appeared contemporaneously with Banks', 

 '93, first publication, differs from Banks and Walton, in regarding the 

 epimeron and episternum as parts of the same segment, and in addition 

 he finds traces of other " complementary" segments in such forms as 

 Locusta, (Edipoda, etc. These complementary segments are especially 

 well developed in the larvae of Lampyris, and here show a great simi- 

 larity to the condition found in Scolopendrella — which Kolbe considers 

 as an intermediate form between the rest of the myriopods and insects. 



Verhoeff, '02-04, accepted Kolbe's theory, which he enlarged and 

 worked out more in detail. Believing that traces of three "Vorder- 

 segmente" or complementary segments (one in front of the pro-, meso-, 

 and meta-thorax respectively) are to be found in such insects as 

 Japyx, Embia, etc., he proposes that the typical hexapod thorax is 

 composed of six primitive segments. To the " Vordersegmente " he 

 gives the names micro-, steno- and crypto-thorax. Of these, the 

 microthorax (the complementary segment in front of the prothorax) 

 is the best developed, and occurs in a large number of insects. In 




8 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



Japyx, etc., between each chief segment and its corresponding " Vorder- 

 segment," and also in front of each Vordersegment, are found certain 

 minute sclerites which Verhoeff interprets as the remains of two 

 "intercalary" segments. Under these conditions, each of the three 

 commonly accepted thoracic regions would in reality be composed of 

 four subsegments (i.e., a chief and a complementary segment, each with 

 its corresponding intercalary segment), thus giving a total of twelve 

 subsegments for the thorax as a whole. 



In this connection it may be remarked that Banks, '04, is entirely 

 incorrect in stating that his theory is supported by the views of Ver- 

 hoeff. In reality the two are not at all alike, for, while Banks con- 

 siders that the epimeron and episternum represent two annuli, Verhoeff 

 expressly states that these two sclerites are parts of one and the same 

 segment, in front of which he finds the additional so-called comple- 

 mentary and intercalary segments. 



If then, with Banks, we consider the epimeron and episternum as 

 representing two subsegments, a combination of Banks' and Verhoeff' s 

 theories would give five subsegments in each thoracic region, or a total 

 of fifteen for the entire thorax. On the other hand, if MacLeay's, '30, 

 contention, that the prsescutum, scutum, scutellum and postscutellum 

 represent four annuli, be correct, a combination of this with Verhoeff 's 

 theory would raise the total number of thoracic subsegments to twenty- 

 one. This reductio ad absurdum only serves to show to what extremes 

 it may lead if we regard each of the sclerites which chance to be serially 

 arranged as the remains of a vestigial segment. Then, too, in view 

 of the marked tendency toward the formation of separate chitinous 

 plates which, as will be later discussed, takes place largely through 

 mechanical causes, and for the most part without reference to any 

 segmental arrangement, one cannot be too cautious in attributing to 

 them a segmental value. 



While it must be admitted that the "compound-segment" theory 

 is a most attractive and not wholly groundless one, the following 

 serious objections to the above cited theories may be made. Thus, 

 the mere occurrence of four regions in the tergum, or the fact that the 

 pleuron is divided into epimeron and episternum, is not sufficient proof 

 that the segment is compound, since such divisions frequently occur 

 from purely mechanical causes, and wholly without reference to any 

 segmental arrangement — as, for example, the division of each segment 

 into tergum, pleura and sternum. 



Again, one should not lay too great stress upon the conditions found 

 in Myriopoda as an indication of what has occurred in Insecta. A 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 9 



similar mode of life frequently leads to a remarkable convergence in 

 structure, which would, however, have no value in a genetic homolo- 

 gization. Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that insects are not 

 descended from myriopods, but that recent Myriopoda, Crustacea, 

 Insecta, etc., are groups of equal rank; and modifications in any direc- 

 tion may occur in each of the groups, quite independently of what 

 occurs in any of the others. 



Patten's argument, that the presence of two cross commissures in 

 each neuromere is indicative of its double nature, loses its force when 

 we consider that in many insects the last abdominal ganglion — which 

 is regarded as the fusion product of a number of neuromeres — likewise 

 contains but two cross commissures; whereas, if Patten's argument 

 were correct, there should be as many commissures present as there are 

 neuromeres entering into its composition. With regard to the bifur- 

 cated maxillae of insects, it would appear far more reasonable to explain 

 this condition as a secondary development, rather than the persistence 

 of a primitive condition in such highly specialized appendages as the 

 mouth parts; and Patten's other argument, that insect abnormalities 

 with double pairs of legs are of frequent occurrence, has no weight 

 when one considers the fact that there are likewise many vertebrate 

 monsters with double appendages — yet no one considers this as a 

 reversion to the primitive condition. 



With regard to Kolbe's, '93, conclusions based upon the thorax of 

 the larva of Lampyris, etc., it must be remembered that the larval 

 form by no means represents the most primitive condition, but is 

 rather an adaptation to its mode of life, as is so well shown in the 

 hypermetamorphosis of Sitaris humeralis. Again, in certain lepidop- 

 teran larvae — Sphinx for example — it is very easy to observe a marked 

 tendency toward the formation of intrasegmental rings ; and this sug- 

 gests that the extra constrictions in the soft larval bodies of Lampyris, 

 Rhaphidia, etc., are probably some such superficial modifications, 

 especially since no indications of any subdivision is indicated in such 

 important segmental structures as the ganglia, tracheae, etc. 



Banks', '93, theory, that the meso- and metathoracic styli of Machilis 

 are rudimentary legs, has no support either from an embryological 

 or a structural point of view, and he seems to have been unaware of 

 Haase's, '89, far more probable explanation of these structures as 

 modified setae. Furthermore, Borner, '03, and Henneguy, '04, recently 

 homologize these organs with the exopodite of the Crustacea, while 

 Verhoeff, '03-'04, following Haase, '89, compares them to the coxal 

 organs of Myriopoda. 




10 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



The theory of Walton, '00, who considers the "meron" as a vestigial 

 leg, seems likewise highly improbable. From an examination of a 

 large number of insects, it would appear that the meron is merely a 

 portion of the coxa. In such generalized forms as the Blattidse, it is 

 not at all, or only partially, distinguishable from the remainder of the 

 coxa; but in less generalized forms, as for example the Lepidoptera, 

 it becomes more separated from the coxa, and in the highly specialized, 

 swiftly-flying Diptera it is drawn quite into the pleural region, doubt- 

 less as the result of muscular tension. 



Walton's other theory, that the pterygoda represent a pair of epi- 

 meral wings, is fully as improbable as his meron hypothesis. The 

 pterygoda bear absolutely no resemblance to wings in structure or in 

 development, and, furthermore, no fossil remains show any traces of 

 more than one pair of wings to each thoracic segment. Walton has 

 tried to evade these facts by suggesting that the tegulse, etc., are wing 

 "fundaments." With regard to this supposition, all that can be said 

 is, that, so far as our present knowledge extends, the tegulse have funda- 

 mentally nothing in common with wings, and any attempt to discuss 

 what they might develop into belongs wholly to the realm of specula- 

 tion. 



If, as Patten, '90, states, two pairs of tracheal invaginations occur 

 in each segment of Acilius, this would indeed be a strong proof of seg- 

 mental fusion. In the adult Acilius, however, this is certainly not the 

 case. Embryos of this insect were not accessible, but in the embryos 

 of Chrysopa, and the far more primitive Forficula, there are no traces of 

 more than one tracheal invagination to the segment. Furthermore, 

 in all illustrations of other insect embryos that I could find, only one 

 tracheal invagination is indicated in each segment, and there are no 

 evidences of a double nature in the ganglia or any other important 

 segmental structures. 



This lack of embryological evidence is the chief argument against 

 the hypothesis of segmental fusion, and until proof more convincing 

 than that brought forward in support of the above cited theories can 

 be offered, it would seem preferable to adopt a mechanical explanation 

 — as, for example, muscular tension, etc. — to account for the origin of 

 the separate sclerites. 



In attempting to apply this thery it must be borne in mind that the 

 sclerites are not produced in a more or less haphazard fashion, as such 

 extremists as Graber seem to think, but one can trace the systematic 

 following out of a ground plan common to all three of the thoracic seg- 

 ments. 




191)9.] NATURAL, SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 1 



Lowne, '90, is quite incorrect in his statement that the prothoracic 

 sclerites cannot be homologized with those of the other two segments, as 

 a glance at the thorax of any Blattid would have convinced him. 

 His criticism of Audouin, '20, for taking as a type so "specialized" a 

 segment as the wing-bearing one, is likewise wholly unjustified; for 

 a comparative study can lead to no other conclusion than that the 

 segment bearing the functional wing has undergone the least modifi- 

 cation. The pro thorax in many cases has been reduced to a mere 

 collar, and, indeed, Brongniart, '90, finds that in certain fossil insects 

 this segment bore a wing-like appendage which has since been lost. 

 The prothorax, then, cannot be chosen as a type, and in the segment 

 which does not bear the functional wing — as for example the meta- 

 thorax of the diptera — it is convincingly apparent that there has been 

 a great fusion and reduction of both sclerites and muscles. It is the 

 wing-bearing segment, therefore, that more nearly represents the primi- 

 tive condition, and if Lowne had not confined his attention to a special- 

 ized species of the highly specialized dipteran order, he would have seen 

 how illogical are his conclusions for insects in general, based upon so 

 modified a form. 



General Description. 



The Tergum. — As has been previously stated, the structure of the 

 prothorax is essentially the same as that of the other two segments. 

 This principle, however, may lead to a mistaken interpretation of the 

 condition exhibited in the prothoracic tergum (or the pronotum, as 

 Burmeister, '32, terms it) of certain insects. Thus most text-books 

 state that in the grasshopper's pronotum, the ring-like areas, produced 

 by a series of transverse furrows, represent the prsescutum, scutum, 

 scutellum and postscutellum — as is figured by Brooks, '82, for example. 

 Theoretically this sounds very plausible, but a comparison with a large 

 number of Saltatoria shows that these wrinklings are largely of a 

 secondary nature. Not only is the musculature quite different, but 

 it is likewise the case that the four subdivisions of the meso- and meta- 

 thoracic terga never occur as such regular, parallel rings. In addition 

 to this, in certain Acrididse (Dictyophorus for example) there are even 

 more than four rings, and in some cases the transverse furrows which 

 mark off these rings are interrupted, thus showing their secondary 

 character. 



The praescutum and postscutellum usually form what Kirby, '28, 

 terms a phragma — that is to say an inward projecting process of the 

 tergum. Such a prsescutum or postscutellum has never been described

for the prothorax, and it would appear that if such structures ever 



existed in the pronotum they have since been lost through reduction 



or fusion with the scutum and scutellum. 



The Prcescutum. — As has been stated, it is impossible to distinguish 



a prsescutum in the prothorax, but in the mesothorax this sclerite is 



frequently represented by a well developed phragma (fig. 1, Nj). 



This phragma is apparently a portion of the tergum drawn inward and 



downward by muscular tension, and is 



separated from the scutum by the line 



of attachment of the intersegmental 



membrane, beneath which the phragma 



projects into the body cavity. 



In his earlier works Audouin did 



not distinguish between the phragma 



and the triangular portion of the 



scutum immediately behind it (N 23 ),

paper/ the word prsescutum as synonymous 



with Kleuker's protophragma — in 



other words the prsescutum is only the anterior phragma of the tergal 



region. 



The prsescutum of the metathorax is frequently fused with the 

 postscutellum of the preceding segment or it may be greatly reduced. 

 On this account Kleuker, '83, terms the second phragma the deutero- 

 phragma, whether it is composed of the mesothoracic postscutellum, 

 the metathoracic prsescutum, or of both together. It would seem 

 preferable, however, to use Audouin's terminology, which is not only 

 more exact, but also has the right of priority. 



On either side of the mesothoracic prsescutum of such insects as 

 Myrmeleon, Mantispa, etc., are two bridge-like plates lying just in 

 front of the wings, and connecting the tergum with the upper portion 

 of the episternum. These plates appear to represent the so-called 

 prsesegmental lamellse described by Voss, '04, in the thorax of Gryllus. 

 Since these plates are not internal lamellse, in most insects, but occur 

 usually as external sclerites, they will be here referred to as the prseseg- 

 mental sclerites. 



The Scutum. — The thorax of Dytiscus, which Audouin, '24, chose as 

 his type for insects in general, is too greatly modified to show the nor- 

 mal relations of the tergal subdivisions, but fortunately Audouin, '32, 

 has given a more serviceable description in his translation of MacLeay's 




1909.] 



NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA.

article on Polistes. By comparing the thorax of Polistes with that of 

 certain other less specialized Hymenoptera, such for example as 

 Macroxyela, Tenthredo, etc.. in which the mesonotum has retained a 

 ■comparatively primitive condition, it is an easy matter to apply 

 Audouin's terminology to insects in general. 



In the mesothorax of Macroxyela, Chrysopa, Myrmeleon, etc., the 

 portion of the tergum just behind the prsescutum is composed of two 

 regions : a median portion triangular in shape, with its apex directed 

 caudad (fig. 1, N 2& ), and a larger portion surrounding the first laterally 

 and posteriorly (A 7 ^). The triangular median region of the scutum 

 may be termed the mediscutum, and the remainder the parapsido- 

 scutum (from MacLeay's, '30, parapsides, applied to two pieces sepa- 

 rated off from this region in Polistes). 



In his description of Dytiscus, Audouin regards the mediscutum as 

 part of the prsescutum, while in his translation of MacLeay's work he 

 speaks of the region corresponding to the mediscutum as the scutum 

 proper, and likewise reckons the parapsides to the scutellar region. 

 The latter division is the only natural one, and has consequently been 

 adopted in this discussion. 



In the Hymenoptera, one can trace an extremely interesting series 

 of changes in the scutellar region of the mesothorax. Thus, if one 

 examine the thorax of Macroxyela, Abia, Odynerus and Chrysis, in the 

 order given, it will be seen that the apex of the triangular mediscutum 

 (figs. 1 and 2, N 23 ) becomes gradually lengthened out, and pushes 

 through that portion of the parapsidoscutum (N 2h ) behind it until it 

 reaches the scutellum (N 3 ). Its sides then begin to open out, and 

 become nearly parallel. By this 

 process the formerly triangular 

 mediscutum assumes a rectangular 

 form (fig. 2, N 2a ), and divides the 

 parapsidoscutum into two widely sepa- 

 rated halves (N 2 ^ and AT 2 b), the parap- 

 sides of MacLeay, '30. 



As shown by MacGillivray, '06, the 

 wing veins of the Xyelidse show that 

 this family is the most generalized of 

 the Hymenoptera. Consequently the 

 thorax of Macroxyela is more primitive 

 than that of Polistes — an opinion which 

 is confirmed by a comparison with cer- 

 tain lower insects, such as Myrmeleon, 

 etc. If this be true, one is justified in assuming that the " parapsides ' 



Fig. 2. — Eumenes. — Dorsal 

 view of the mesothorax. A 

 comparison with fig. 1 shows 

 that the mediscutum (N" 2 a) 

 has pushed through the par- 

 apsidoscutum (N" 2 b) and di- 

 vided it into the two "par- 

 apsides" (N" 2 b and N" 2 b). 






14 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



of Polistes are but portions of the mesothoracic parapsidoscutum. 

 MacLeay's suggestion, that the mesothoracic parapsides are but the 

 prothoracic paraptera( !) pushed back from their original position, 

 must, therefore, be regarded as entirely untenable. 



The parapsidoscutum is very closely connected with the organs of 

 flight; and indeed its caudal portion appears to merge into the mem- 

 branous anal region of the wing. 



Along the sides of the scutum lie a number of small plates which are 

 usually free, but may be more or less fused with one another or with 

 the scutum. Jurine, '20, has described six of these for Hymenoptera, 

 but only three are of particular importance. The first of these is found 

 at the base of the costal region of the wing, and has been termed the 

 antesigmoid by Amans, '85; the second, which Amans terms the 

 "piece quadrilatere" (sigmoid), is situated at the base of the median 

 region of the wing; and the third or dorso-terminal lies at the base of 

 the anal region of the wing. The structure and mechanism of these 

 sclerites has been described in detail by Amans, '85, and Voss, '04, 

 and need not, therefore, be further discussed here. 



In addition to the above-mentioned sclerites, there occur two plates 

 (one at the base of each wing) which have been variously termed 

 squsemula, tegula, paraptera, pterygoda, etc. Of these terms, La- 

 treille's, '20, "pterygodes" or pterygoda appears to have the right of 

 priority, and on this account has been here adopted. In Gryllus, Voss, 

 '04, has described a structure which he terms a " Hautpolster," but does 

 not compare it with other insects. This structure is beyond a doubt 

 homologous with the pterygoda, and bears the characteristic hairs. 

 In the Trichoptera, although still somewhat "Polster"-like, it is more 

 strongly chitinized, and in the Hymenoptera it forms a horny scale, 

 covering the base of the wing. In certain Lepidoptera the pterygoda 

 are greatly developed and are densely beset with hairs. Westwood, 

 '39, has confused these with the patagia of the Lepidoptera, but they 

 are doubtless quite different structures. 



The Scutellum. — Behind the scutal region lies a small, medianly- 

 situated scutellum (fig. 1, N 3 ). In form it may be somewhat semi- 

 circular, oval, shield- or wedge-shaped. In the latter case its anterior 

 end is embedded in the parapsidoscutum. Its posterior margin is 

 usually drawn out into a narrow strip on either side, and is continued 

 in the posterior margin of the anal region of the wing. . This character 

 is frequently very useful in determining the boundaries between the 

 mesoscutellum and.phragma, or to distinguish[the mesoscutellum from 

 the metanotum when these are partially fused . 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 15 



Voss, '04, appears to consider the scutellum as part of the scutal 

 region, and terms it the "unpaares mittelfeld." This terminology, 

 however, would be incorrect for three reasons: in the first place, 

 because the sclerite in question does not belong to the region which 

 Audouin, '24, calls the scutum, but is what he terms the scutellum; 

 furthermore, the unpaired median region of the scutum, if such existed, 

 would be the triangular mediscutum; and, lastly, there is no "un- 

 paired" region, strictly speaking, in either scutum or scutellum, as the 

 whole tergum was originally divided into two symmetrical halves by 

 a median longitudinal suture. 



This suture, according to Comstock, '02, represents the line of closure 

 of the embryo, and it is along this line that the cuticle is ruptured at the 

 time of moulting. The median dorsal suture may be spoken of as the 

 mid-dorsal suture, while the corresponding median ventral suture 

 (which may represent traces of the neural groove) will be referred to 

 as the mid-ventral suture. 



The mid-dorsal suture is easily seen in such insects as the Sialidse, 

 Perlidse, Tenthredinidse, Psocidae, Tipulidse, Trichoptera, etc. In 

 certain other insects, and some of these are very primitive, as, for 

 example, the roaches and earwigs, one can find scarcely any traces of 

 this suture in the mesothorax, since the tergal subregions have united 

 to form a simple undivided notum. However in the metathorax of 

 some Blattidse, etc., one can distinguish faint traces of these parts. 

 This leads to the conclusion that the simple notum is the result of non- 

 usage of the wings, or the peculiar mode of life of these insects, and 

 would hence be a tertiary modification rather than a retention of the 

 primitive condition. 1 



An examination of the inner ridges, which serve as points of insertion 

 for certain muscles, suggests that the tergum at one time may have been 

 a single piece, but, though muscular tension, ridges were drawn inward, 

 thus creating corresponding furrows or sutures on the exterior surface. 

 It is possible that the so-called parapsidal furrows, or sutures separating 

 the medi- from the parapsido-scutum, were formed in this way, as is 

 likewise the case with the furrow which separates the parapsidoscutum 

 from the scutellum. The latter furrow may be spoken of as the scutel- 

 lar suture. 



The Postscutellum. — Behind the scutellum lies the postscutellum (fig. 

 1, N 4 ), which usually occurs as a phragma projecting more or less into 



1 In the Apterygota, however, the simple, undivided notum doubtless repre- 

 sents the primitive condition. 




16 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



the body cavity, or, as is the case in the Diptera, it may be largely 

 external (see figs. 7 and 8, N t ). 



The postscutellar phragma is usually much larger than the prse- 

 scutal phragma, and, while the latter is always closely connected with 

 the scutum, the postscutellum may become almost completely sepa- 

 rated from the remainder of the tergum. 



As has been stated, the prsescutum and postscutellum usually occur 

 as phragmas, and between them extend the dorsal longitudinal muscles. 

 It would appear that the arching of the mesothoracic region in such 

 swift-flying insects as the Hymenoptera, Diptera, etc., is caused by the 

 tension of these muscles. In the Diptera, the mesothoracic postscutel- 

 lum is greatly developed to furnish an attachment for these powerful 

 muscles, and the whole mesothorax appears to have grown at the 

 expense of the metathorax, which shrinks away, as it were, thus expos- 

 ing the huge mesothoracic postscutellum. Muscular tension is doubt- 

 less another factor causing the mesothoracic postscutellum to become 

 external, since it would give rise to an arching upward of the tergum 

 and the shifting forward of certain of the sclerites, as will be later dis- 

 cussed. This external character and unusual development of the 

 mesothoracic postscutellum in the Diptera caused Latreille, '20, to 

 mistake it for the notum of the metathorax. He consequently homo- 

 logized the metathorax of the Diptera with the first abdominal seg- 

 ment (the "segment mediaire") of the Hymenoptera. MacLeay, '30, 

 committed a somewhat similar error in considering the first abdominal 

 segment (which is closely connected with the thorax in pedunculate 

 Hymenoptera) as part of the metanotum. Consequently, that portion 

 which he terms the postscutellum in Polistes belongs to the abdominal 

 region. 



The postscutellum 2 (fig. 7, N t ) of the TipulidsG is greatly developed 

 and is distinctly divided into three regions — a median region which 

 may be termed the mediophragmite (iV 4a ), and two lateral regions 

 which will be spoken of as the pleurophragmites (N&). Each of the 

 pleurophragmites may be subdivided into a superior (iV 4 b s ) and 

 inferior (A 7 4 bi) region, and the mediophragmite likewise may be 

 divided into symmetrical halves by a continuation of the mid-ventral 

 suture. 



In certain insects in which the pleurophragmite is not connected with 

 the pleura, it would appear that a portion of the pleurophragmite 



2 Snodgrass, '08, frequently states that the Orthoptera have no postscutellum. 

 This is not the case in the Gryllidae, for example, as the postscutellum of 

 Gryllus domesticus is quite well developed. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 17 



becomes separated off and remains connected with the epimeron. 

 This piece has been termed by Kolbe, '93, the "parapleure" in the 

 Coleoptera, but this term is quite differently applied by other inves- 

 tigators. Thus Voss, '04, considers "parapleura" as synonymous 

 with episternum. On the other hand Cuvier, '23, states that the 

 "parapleural" are the "epimeres." According to MacLeay, '30, the 

 "parapleural" are the episterna. Latreille, '20, considers the para- 

 pleurae as the "epimeres du metathorax. " Lacordaire, '54, speaks of 

 the epimeron and episternum together as the "parapleures," and 

 erroneously ascribes this usage to Audouin. According to Knoch, 1801 

 (who introduced the term), "parapleururum" would refer to the 

 episternum; while the episternum and epimeron together were termed 

 "parapleururum duplum." If we are to abide strictly by the rule of 

 priority, the term parapleuron would apply only to the episternum, 

 in which sense it is used by Knoch, 1801, Kirby, '28, MacLeay, '30, 

 Burmeister, '32, Fieber, '61, Voss, '04, and others. However, in the 

 sense used by Kolbe, '93, it is a very useful term, if so used that there 

 would be no danger of confusion with the above cited usages. 



Amans, '85, gives a terminology for the tergal subdivisions entirely 

 different from that here accepted. Thus he proposes the names 

 prodorsum, dorsum, postdorsum and sub-postdorsum for exactly 

 the same sclerites which Audouin, '24, had previously termed the prae- 

 scutum, scutum, scutellum and postscutellum. Enderlein, '03, has 

 recently adopted Amans' usage, but there appeal's to be no just cause 

 for thus arbitrarily changing Audouin's terminology, which not only 

 has the right of priority, but also has the advantage of widespread 

 acceptance, and is not open to the objection mentioned by Audouin 

 himself, namely, the term dorsum should be applied only to the entire 

 dorsal surface of the insect, in contradistinction to the venter, ventrum 

 or ventral surface. 



As has been previously mentioned, Kleuker's, '83, terminology is 

 inexact, in that he does not distinguish between the postscutellum of 

 the mesothorax and praescutum of the metathorax, but terms them 

 indiscriminately the deuterophragma. Moreover, Voss', '04, substi- 

 tution of the term postscutum for postscutellum is quite unwarranted, 

 and it would appear far preferable to employ only the simple and appro- 

 priate terminology of Audouin, '24. 



The Wing. — The wing, as we have seen, is very closely connected 



with the parapsidoscutum, and indeed Packard, '98, believes that the 



wing fundaments are scutal structures. They usually arise as sack-like 



folds of the body wall, and in insects with incomplete metamorphosis 



2 




18 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan.;; 



appear as lateral outgrowths of the caudal margin of the tergum. 

 Thisis well shown in the development of the male Blattid, in which the 

 elytron-like fore wings project from the posterior margin of the tergum, 

 becoming more and more elongate at each moult, and finally develop 

 into^chitinous structures in which the characteristic venation of the 

 wings^is clearly shown. This has led to the theory that the wings 

 arose as lateral outgrowths of the margin of the notum, originally 

 acting as a sort of parachute, but later developing into functional 

 wings. Another theory is that the wings and legs have a similar 

 origin. In a third theory, it is claimed that the wings develop from 

 tracheal gills; and in yet another, it is held that the wings are modi- 

 fied spiracles. It is not proposed to discuss these theories here at 

 length, but, in objection to Gegenbauer's, '78, tracheal-gill theory, 

 it may be remarked that Palmen, '77, has clearly demonstrated that 

 the closed tracheal system is only a secondary adaptation to the aquatic 

 life of the larva, and that aerial respiration was doubtless the primitive 

 one. On this account, it is hardly probable that wings have developed 

 from tracheal gills. 



Walton, '01, believes that the tegulse or pterygoda are rudimentary 

 wings, but, as has been previously discussed, there is absolutely no 

 proof for the statement that these structures are wing fundaments, 

 either from an embryological or a structural point of view. Comstock, 

 '95, suggested that "the wing covers or elytra of earwigs and beetles 



probably correspond to the tegulse that is, they are a pair of 



side pieces of the mesothorax, the parapleura, greatly enlarged." 

 Walton has followed out this suggestion in his theory, and likewise 

 adopts the view that the alulet-like structures under the elytra of 

 Hydrophilus, etc., represent extra wings. Comstock, '98, however, 

 has shown that the elytra are the modified wings, and that the mem- 

 branous structures beneath them are quite comparable to the alulae of 

 Diptera, etc., and are even bordered by the "spring vein" characteristic 

 of the alulae. 3 



In the most generalized insects the tracheation follows the path indi- 

 cated by the chief cuticular thickenings, which later become the veins 

 for stiffening the wings. The tracheation, therefore, is frequently of 

 great value in determining the homology of the principal wing veins, 

 and was much used by Comstock, '98, in the comparison of the 

 venation throughout the orders. The principal veins recognized by 

 him are the costa, subcosta, radius, media, cubitus, and the anals. 



3 See Sharp, '96. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 19 



This terminology, based upon that of Redtenbacher, '86, is the one 

 usually accepted by modern systematists, and has consequently been 

 here adopted. 



The Pleuron. — The two principal sclerites of the pleuron are the 

 episternum and epimeron of Audouin, '24. The later terms, ante- 

 pleuron (episternum) and postpleuron (epimeron) of Amans, '85, or 

 the coxopleure (episternum) and anopleure (epimeron) of Verhoeff, '03, 

 since they are applied to exactly the same sclerites, must be regarded 

 as superfluous synonyms. The pleurit and subcoxa of Heymons, '99, 

 will be later discussed under the heading Hemiptera. However, it 

 may be remarked of these sclerites — which have given rise to a great 

 deal of discussion — that the pleurit is merely the epimeron, while the 

 greater part of the subcoxa corresponds to the episternum. 



The pleurites of the Blattidae are interesting from the fact that the 

 epimeron and episternum appear to be merely portions of a single 

 plate separated into two regions by a deep pocket-like infolding of the 

 integument. This suggests that the episternum and epimeron may 

 originally have been one piece, but became separated by such an in- 

 folding of the integument — possibly due to muscular tension. In this 

 way there would be formed an external furrow, the so-called pleural 

 suture, and a corresponding hollow ridge, the entopleuron or apodeme. 

 This would account for the fact that the apodemes of insects are hollow 

 processes, and it is conceivable that the apodemes would thus arise as 

 hollow invaginations of the body wall of the embryo, even though 

 the muscular tension which originally developed the apodemes were 

 not strongly operative at this stage. 



There is a greal lack of uniformity in the usage of the terms apodeme 

 and apophysis in referring to the internal or " entothoracic " processes. 

 As here used, the expression apodeme is applied solely to internal 

 processes of the pleuron (i.e., the "entopleura"); while the term 

 apophysis refers only to the internal processes of the sternum — the 

 "entosterna." 



The entopleuron may bear four inward projecting processes as fol- 

 lows: above, a pivot, or articulating process for the wing, which may 

 be termed the alar process of the apodeme; and below this a process 

 serving for muscle attachment (in such insects as Panorpa, etc.), which 

 may be termed the intermedian process. The third is usually quite' 

 a large process. It may or may not extend as far as the furca (or 

 forked apophysis of the sternum), but frequently abuts against the end 

 of the furcal arm, and may even fuse with it. This process will be- 

 referred to as the adfurcal process. The process just below it, which.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF

forms an articulation with the coxa, has been termed the coxal process. 

 These'processes will be discussed more at length in a later article dealing 

 with the comparative myology of insects. 



The Epimeron. — It is generally taken for granted that the epimeral 

 and episternal regions of the thorax are not subdivided into smaller 

 sclerites, but a glance at the mesothorax of Cicada (fig. 5) and Tipula 

 (fig. 7) or the metathorax of Myrmeleon (fig. 4) and Chrysopa (fig. 3) 

 will readily convince one that this is an error. 



To illustrate, let us examine the thorax of the widespread insect 

 Chrysopa. For this purpose Chrysopa vulgaris is preferable to the 

 somewhat commoner form Chrysopa perla, as the black bars and 

 markings upon the thorax of the latter insect tend to obscure the 

 sutures between the subregions. 



In the epimeral region of Phassus (fig. 6), and most winged insects 

 as well, one can readily find an elongate plate embedded in the softer 

 cuticule directly under the posterior portion of the wing (EM C ). This 

 sclerite doubtless corresponds to the plate which Lowne, '90, desig- 

 nates as the "costa" in the blow-fly. The term costa, however, has 

 been applied to one of the wing veins, and this usage has been every- 

 where adopted. It would, therefore, seem preferable to substitute 

 the expression costal sclerite in referring to the above mentioned 

 plate. 4 The costal sclerite bears an internal process, which serves as

 there frequently occurs a smaller sclerite which likewise serves as an 

 attachment for the epimeral muscles. This will be spoken of as the 



4 Snodgrass, '08, terms this sclerite the "postepimeron," but since the plate 

 in question is normally " supraepimeral " rather than "postepimeral," Lowne's 

 term, slightly modified, has been here retained.

posterior costal sclerite (EM 2C ). It is usually very small and relatively 

 unimportant. 



In the metathorax of Chrysopa and Myrmeleon, and in the mesotho- 

 rax of Cicada, etc., the epimeron is distinctly divided into an upper 

 and lower portion. The upper region will be referred to as the anaepi- 

 meron 5 or anepimeron (fig. 3, EM & ) and the lower region may be termed 

 the kataepimeron or katepimeron (EM k ). In the Raphidians, the 

 suture between the anepimeron and katepimeron is partly obliterated, 

 and in many other insects all traces of it have disappeared. In 

 Phassus scliamyl (fig. 6), the upper portion of the epimeron is mem- 

 branous, thus suggesting that in other insects the anepimeral region 

 may have originally arisen as a softening of the chitin, to give greater 

 freedom of motion to the wing, and thus become differentiated from 

 the remainder of the epimeron. 



In the Muscinse, there is an arching of the mesothorax and a shifting 

 forward of the sclerites — probably

the result of muscular tension — 

 so that the upper region of the 

 epimeron (EM & ) is bent forward 

 and lies upon the episternum 

 (fig. 8). It would appear that 

 Lowne, '90, and other dipterolo- 

 gists have not been aware of this 

 fact, for Lowne, Hewitt, '07, and 

 a number of others mistake the 

 anepimeron (EM a ) for the epis- 

 ternum and consequently designate the katepimeron (EM^) as the 

 entire epimeron. A comparison with one of the Tipulidse — in which 

 group the sclerites are in their normal positions — readily shows the 

 error of such a homologization. In the Tipulidse, and less distinctly 

 in the Ephemeridse, the pleurophragmite (or lateral region of the 

 postscutellar phragma) is so closely connected with the pleuron that 

 it appears to be a part of the pleural region (fig. 7, N 4 hs)', but, with 

 the "parapleure" of the Coleoptera, it should be classed as a portion 

 of the posts cutellum. 



Connected with the lower portion of the epimeron in Chrysopa and 

 a number of other insects is a sclerite termed the meron (fig. 3, C 2 ). 



6 In an earlier publication (Crampton, '08) the term hyper- and hypo-epimeron 

 were employed to designate these regions, but, upon further consideration, it 

 has seemed preferable to substitute the designations ana- and kata-epimeron, 

 which are not so confusingly similar as the former terms.

PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



[Jan., 



This sclerite is of a variable nature, being entirely coxal in some insects, 

 while in others it is entirely pleural. The origin and nature of this 

 sclerite will be more fully described in the discussion of the sclerites 

 of the leg. 



The Episternum. — While the division into ana- and kata-epimeron is 

 shown in but few hexapods, a subdivision of the episternum into an 

 upper and lower region is evident in a great number of insects. Among 

 these may be mentioned Sialis, Hepialus, Corydalis, Phassus, Bittacus, 

 Cicada, Tipula, Mantispa, Hemerobius, Raphidia, Chrysopa, Myrmeleon, 

 the Nemoptera, Trichoptera, and a large number of other insects from 

 different families. Beyond a doubt, if enough material could be ex- 

 amined, it would be found that indications of this division occur in 

 some genera of every family.

The epimeral subdivisions are best shown in Mantispa, but Chrysopa 

 serves the purpose almost as well, and is a much commoner insect. 

 In Chrysopa, the upper region of the episternum — which will be termed 

 the anepisternum (fig. 3, ES a ), is separated from the lower or "katepi- 

 sternum" (ES^), by a narrow strip which may be spoken of as the 

 median region of the episternum (ES m ). In the thorax of Chrysopa 

 this strip is very narrow, but in the thorax of Myrmeleon it is quite 

 broad (fig. 4, ES m ). In the metathorax of the Forficulidse, the upper 

 portion of the anepisternal region is frequently cut off by a white, 

 scar-like softening of the chitin of the episternum. Verhoeff, '03, 

 terms this piece the pteropleure. 6

previously mentioned shifting forward of the anepimeral region in 

 the Muscidse (fig. 8, EM a ) has displaced the anepisternum (ES a ) in 

 the mesothorax. This phenomenon has led to a great variety of 

 interpretations of these sclerites in the Diptera. Thus Brauer, '82, 

 refers to the anepisternum (fig. 7, ES & ) as the entire episternum, and 

 the katepisternal region (ES^) as the sternum. Lowne, '90, mistakes 

 the anepimeron (fig. 8, EM&) for the entire episternum, and, therefore, 

 terms the anepisternum (ES&) the "lateral plate." Hammond, '81, 

 commits the same error and terms the anepisternum the parapteron. 

 The latter term, however, cannot be used in this connection, as Audouin, 

 '32, made it synonymous with squamula, i.e., the tegula or pterygodum. 

 As first employed by Audouin, '24, the designation parapteron was 

 applied to the anterior margin of the episternum. Audouin himself 

 seems to have had a great deal of trouble in homologizing this region 

 with that of other insects, and finally solved the difficulty by applying 

 the terms hypopteron and parapteron to MacLeay's, '32, squamula — 

 with which they are therefore synonyms, and are so used by most 

 authors. 



On the inner surface of the anepisternum of Chrysopa, Corydalis, 

 and a number of other insects, one can distinguish a lobe-like struc- 

 ture which is apparently formed 

 by the inrolling of the anterior 

 margin of the anepimeron, and 

 serves as an attachment for the 

 muscles extending to the trochan- 

 tin and leg. It is quite easy to 

 follow the modification of this 

 structure in various insects, as it 

 gradually becomes more separated 

 from the anepisternum, assumes 

 a conical form, and is finally 

 connected with the upper portion 

 of the episternum by its apex 

 alone. This plate will be spoken 

 of as the conus. 



The Laterale. — If one compare the mesothorax of a Blattid with that 

 of a Forficulid, it will be seen that the so-called episternum is not the 

 same in both. In order to better understand the relation of the sclerites 

 in these insects a hypothetical type (fig. 20) has been taken as a basis 

 for comparison. In the stage here represented, the epimeron (EM) 

 is indicated as a distinct region, while the remainder of the pleuron

(ES' + L) consists of a single piece which may be designated by 

 Heymon's, '99, term subcoxa. 7 However, it should not be taken for 

 granted that in adopting Heymon's terminology, his theory of the origin 

 of the subcoxa is likewise accepted ; for, as will be later discussed, it is 

 very improbable that the subcoxa is the basal portion of the leg.

 Fig. 11 represents the posterior portion of fig. 9 seen from within; showing the 



apodeme {AD') between the prothoracic episternum (ES') and epimeron (EM'). 



The trochantin (T) is represented as a portion of the subcoxa, though 

 it is quite possible that it was originally a portion of the coxa, separated 

 off by muscular tension, and united with the subcoxa as a secondary 

 modification. For the present, however, this point may be left out 

 of consideration. 



The first division of the subcoxa doubtless occurred along the line 

 a c (fig. 20), thus separating the subcoxa into the episternum (ES) 

 and a region which may be termed the laterale (L). The further divi- 

 sions in the laterale may occur in either of two directions — longitu- 

 dinally or transversely. A longitudinal division (i.e., along the line 

 c i g) would produce the condition found in the cockroach (fig. 21, 

 compare also pi. Ill): that is, there would be a separation into an 

 anterior region, which may be termed the anterior laterale 8 (L a ), and 

 a posterior one, which may be termed the antecoxal laterale (L b ). 

 The latter term is a slight modification of Walton's, '00, "antecoxal 

 piece," which has priority over Verhoeff's, '03, " katopleure. " If, on 

 the other hand, the laterale be divided, not longitudinally (as in the

 considers it the equivalent of his merosternum; and Verhoeff homologizes it

cockroach), but transversely, i.e., along the line / e (fig. 20), we would 

 have the condition found in the earwig (see fig. 19, compare also pi. 

 II). The region nearest the episternum (ES) may be termed the 

 episternal laterale (Lj), and that next the sternum (S) the sternal 

 laterale (L 2 ). In Forficula there is a third piece, the "hyposternal 

 laterale" (L 3 ), which is not so deeply pigmented as the other two. It 

 is usually covered by the sternum, and in Anisolabis it appears to be 

 fused with the sternal laterale. 



The interpretation of the relations of these sclerites as given by 

 Verhoeff, '03, differs very widely from the one just discussed. This 

 investigator homologizes the episternum of the earwig (fig. 19, ES) 

 with the episternum plus the anterior laterale in the cockroach (fig. 

 21, ES + La). The earwig's episternal laterale (fig. 19, L x ) he homo- 

 logizes with the antecoxal laterale of the cockroach (fig. 21, L\>); and 

 as the earwig's sternal laterale (fig. 19, L 2 ) would then have no corre- 

 sponding sclerite in the cockroach, Verhoeff seeks to explain the sternal 

 laterale as a "Vorplatte" or anterior plate which lies in front of the 

 sternum in the pro thorax (i.e., a lateral cervical?), but in the meso- 

 and metathorax it is supposed in some way to become drawn around 

 to the side of the sternum and take up a position between the latter 

 and the antecoxal laterale (or "katopleure"). The musculature gives 

 no indication of such a caudad migration of the lateral cervicals, or 

 of any other " Vorderstuck," and it is difficult to see how such a theory 

 can be supported. On the other hand, it is quite comprehensible that 

 a transverse, as well as a longitudinal division might occur, since a 

 similar division is clearly traceable in the prothoracic trochantin of 

 the Blattidse. 



In the metathorax of the Dermaptera (or Euplexoptera) the sterna) 



laterale has apparently fused with the sternum (pi. II). In the 



prothorax of Anisolabis (pi. II) the 



episternal laterale (L t ) has partially 



fused with the episternum, but traces 



of its outlines are still preserved. The 



sternal laterale may be readily observed 



as a distinct sclerite (L 2 ), but both it 



and the episternal laterale (L 2 ) are

(the prothoracic sternal laterale) and one of the cervicals with the meso- 

 thoracic episternal laterale of the same specimen. The remaining scle- 

 rites of the posterior lateral cervicals (CS 2X ) he homologizes with the 

 sternal laterale of the mesothorax. Borner likewise considers that the 

 mesothoracic sternal laterale (pi. II, L" 2 ) and episternal laterale (L'\) 

 are subdivisions of the antecoxal laterale (pi. Ill, Lb). These views 

 however seem quite untenable. 



The longitudinal division of the laterale into the anterior and ante- 

 coxal regions is best shown in the cockroach (pi. Ill), although it is 

 clearly traceable in a number of insects. In many Neuroptera, as for 

 example Corydalis (fig. 17), Chrysopa (fig. 3), etc., the antecoxal 

 laterale appears as a narrow strip (Lb) connecting the katepimeral 

 complex 9 (Esk X ) with that portion of the sternum which will be later 

 spoken of as the furci-sternum (S 3 ). The anterior laterale (L a ) is 

 usually quite large, filling the region between the episternum and the 

 "Basi-sternum" (*S> 2 ). 



In the thorax of Gryllus, Voss, '04, has described a sclerite which 

 seems to correspond in part to the laterale. He terms this sclerite the 

 coxosternum, upon the ground that it represents the region so desig- 

 nated by Borner, '03. This homologizing, however, is quite incorrect, 

 for, as may be readily seen in his figures, Borner's "coxosternum" 

 includes the epimeron, episternum and laterale. Furthermore, Ver- 

 hoeff had long before employed the term "coxasternum" to designate 

 the fusion product of the coxae with the sternum. The laterale, there- 

 fore, can hardly be termed the " coxosternum. " 



The Trochantin. — The small, somewhat triangular-shaped sclerite 

 articulating with the coxa is designated as the trochantin, trochantine 

 or trochantinus. In the Blattidse (fig. 21 and pi. Ill) the trochantin (T) 

 is quite large, and in some species it is united for a short distance with 

 the episternum. In the Trichoptera (fig. 18) it would appear that the 

 trochantin has fused with the katepisternal complex almost completely, 

 its extreme tip alone remaining free. The trochantin may thus com- 

 pletely fuse with the katepisternal complex, or, according to certain 

 ■coleopterologists, it may fuse with the coxa. 



In the prothorax of all the Blattidse that the writer could obtain 

 the trochantin is transversely divided into two regions, the larger of 

 which may be termed the trochantinus major and the smaller one the 

 trochantinus minor. This condition seems to be a characteristic of 

 the Blattidse alone, and may prove to be of systematic value. 



8 I.e., fusion product of the katepimeron, part of the trochantin, and a portion

1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 27 



If one compare the mesothoracic trochantin of a Blattid (pi. Ill) 

 with that of Chrysopa (fig. 3) and Corydalis (fig. 17), it appears that the 

 so-called trochantin of Chrysopa and Corydalis correspond only to the 

 "minor" region in the cockroach. The condition in Corydalis indi- 

 cates that the minor region may become constricted off and form what 

 is usually considered the entire trochantin in certain insects, while 

 the major region fuses with the episternum — as it partially does in the 

 pro thorax of the Blattidse. 



In the cockroach this breaking of the prothoracic trochantin into 

 two pieces is so evident that it is difficult to see how Sharp, '95, could 

 have so confused these sclerites in his figure of 

 Blabera gigantea {Cambridge Natural History, 

 Vol. I, p. 222). He has turned the figure upside 

 down, thus making it more difficult to see what he 

 is trying to show, but it is quite plain that the 

 portion he terms the entire trochantin is only the 

 minor region, while his " epimeron( ?) " is the Fig. 13. — Lyda. — 

 major region of the trochantin. The true epimeron ^oCTviSS^and 

 is the sclerite he designates as a fold of the pro- prothorax. 

 notum. 



In the mesothorax of Forficula (pi. II) the trochantin is not trans- 

 versely, but longitudinally divided into separate pieces (T & and T^). 

 In the Blattidse (fig. 21 and pi. Ill) this division is indicated by a longi- 

 tudinal suture — the trochantinal suture — which is present not only in 

 the meso- and meta-thoracic trochantin {T" and T'"), but also in the 

 major and minor portions of the prothoracic trochantin (T\ and T' 2 ), 

 thus clearly indicating that the latter are but parts of a single piece. 

 Of the two regions marked off by the trochantinal suture, the posterior 

 one will be termed the coxal trochantin 10 (pi. Ill, T^) and the anterior 

 region will be referred to as the antecoxal trochantin (T a ). 



Comstock, '02, terms the antecoxal trochantin (TV) the antecoxal 

 piece, and refers to the antecoxal laterale (T h ) as the second antecoxal 

 piece. In using the terms antecoxal trochantin and antecoxal laterale 

 an attempt has been here made to retain Comstock's terms, and yet 

 make it clear to what region the parts so designated belong. It must 

 be borne in mind that Comstock's, '02, antecoxal piece (i.e., the ante- 

 coxal trochantin) is not the same as Walton's, '00, antecoxal piece 

 (the antecoxal laterale), and neither of these sclerites corresponds to 



10 With reference to the designation of this sclerite, the term "accessory tro- 

 chantin plate" (Snodgrass, '08), of which the writer was not aware at the time 

 the above given terminology was proposed, has the right of priority. 




28 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [Jan., 



the piece termed the "antecoxal piece" in Comstock's, '95, figure of 

 Enchroma gigantea (page 503). In the latter case, the antecoxal 

 piece corresponds to that portion of the sternum which will be later 

 referred to as the furci sternum. The writer was not able to discover 

 the original use of the expression, but as early as 1861, Leconte, in 

 his classification of the Coleoptera of North America, states that a 

 pair of "horny plates" is found embedded in the membrane of the neck, 

 and terms these the "antecoxal plates." The plates here referred to 

 are evidently the cervical sclerites. 



As has been mentioned, Comstock, '02, designates the antecoxal 

 trochantin (pi. Ill, T & ) the antecoxal piece. On the other hand, he 



refers to the coxal trochantin as the entire trochan- 

 tin. The latter usage, however, is quite incorrect, 

 for the coxal- and antecoxal-trachantin together 

 form the trochantin, and it is in this sense that 

 the term will be used in the following discussion.

preferable if entomologists had adopted the term 



rotule ; for the latter term better expresses the function of this sclerite, 



is not borrowed from vertebrate anatomy, and is not so confusingly 



similar to the term trochanter, as is the case with Audouin's trochantin. 



However, the name trochantin, or the latinized form trochantinus, 



given it by MacLeay, '30, is a very useful term and has received too 



wide an acceptance to attempt to change it. 



Between the trochantin and the coxa lies a very small chitinous 



plate, the complementary coxal sclerite, 11 or "complementary plate" 



(Borner, '03), which bears an internal process, the complementary 



process, to which are attached certain muscles extending to the epi- 



sternum. This small sclerite is frequently fused with the coxa, and the 



complementary process then appears as a process of the coxal margin.

The Leg. — The coxa is very closely connected with the pleuron in 

 certain insects, and indeed Miall and Denny, '86, consider that the 

 pleural sclerites are "two basal leg-joints which have become adherent 

 to the thorax." From his embryological studies, Heymons, '99, also 

 adopts this view in designating the "subcoxa" as the basal portion of 

 the leg. Borner, '03, at first considered the pleural sclerites as plates 

 which have become separated from the sternum, but he later adopted 

 Heymons' view. 



The theory that the pleural sclerites are basal leg-joints appears 

 hardly tenable. In those insect larvae which have long, well-developed 

 legs (as for example Corydalis, Carabus, etc.) it is necessary that the 

 muscles have some firm support, and it is doubtless the stimulus of 

 the muscular tension which causes the formation of certain sclerites 

 in the soft integument of the larva. This is certainly a far more reason- 

 able supposition than that the epimeron and episternum would be 

 drawn up from a hard chitinized leg region into a soft pleural region, 

 before the latter region were sufficiently resistant to furnish the needed 

 support for the muscles. In the above mentioned insects, the pleural 

 sclerites first appear near the base of the leg, and it is quite possible 

 that these would appear to arise from the basal region of the embry- 

 onic leg mass, as it is impossible to say just where the leg begins and the 

 pleuron ends in the embryonic stages. There is such a shifting, 

 flattening, and distorting of the parts in those forms upon which 

 Heymons bases his conclusions, that he was deceived into considering 

 that the mesothoracic subcoxa (fig. 16) represents the epimeron and 

 episternum together, whereas, in reality, it represents the mesothoracic 

 episternum, laterale, and perhaps the trochantin. On the other hand, 

 the "pleurit," which he considers as representing the metathoracic 

 pleurites, does not belong to the metathorax at all, but is merely the 

 mesothoracic epimeron (fig. 15, EM"). This mesothoracic epimeron 

 is thrown into a fold by the shifting forward of the region behind it 

 and overlaps the metathoracic epimeron (EM'"), which escaped 

 Heymons' attention altogether. These facts serve to illustrate how 

 easily the embryonic regions may be confused ; and when one takes into 

 consideration that even in the larval stages of the above mentioned 

 insects, the pleural sclerites are first formed so near the base of the leg, 

 it is readily comprehensible that Heymons could have been misled 

 into considering the pleurites as basal leg-joints, since in the embry- 

 onic stages (upon which he bases his conclusions) there is no sharp 

 distinction between the leg and pleural region. 



It is perhaps worth mentioning in this connection that the katepis- 




30 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



ternal complex, the antecoxal laterale, the furci-sternum (described 

 later), and the katepimeron form a closed ring about the base of the 

 leg, and might consequently be taken for a portion of the leg region; 

 but, for the reasons above stated, this view would be extremely 

 improbable. 



Hansen, '93, compares the trochantin to the coxopodite of the Mala- 

 costraca, and homologizes the coxa with the basipodite. He likewise 

 adopts the views of Wood-Mason, '79, and Jourdain, '88, who pro- 

 pose that the styli on the meso- and meta-thoracic coxae represent the 

 exopodite of the crustacean leg. In a recent article Bonier has again 

 brought this theory into prominence. Henneguy, '04, who likewise 

 compares the insect leg with that of the Crustacea, differs from the 

 above-mentioned investigators in that he maintains that the stylus 

 corresponds to the epipodite — not to the exopodite. He argues that 

 if the coxa corresponds to the basipodite, the stylus or coxal appendage 

 must correspond to the epipodite or basipodite appendage, and not 

 to the exopodite, which is the appendage of the coxopodite. 



The above-mentioned views seem hardly probable, for all indica- 

 tions point to the fact that insects are not descended from aquatic, 

 but from terrestrial ancestors. Palmen, '77, has demonstrated that 

 the open tracheal system for aerial respiration is the primitive one, 

 and it may be added that in the development of the Ephemerid embryo, 

 the primordia (or fundaments) of the spiracles may be observed even 

 in the germinal streak. The aquatic life of the larva?, then, must be 

 regarded as a secondary adaptation; and, therefore, one can hardly 

 attempt to homologize the styli of the insect leg with the exopodite 

 or the epipodite of the aquatic Crustacea. 



Banks', '93, theory that the styli are vestigial legs has no founda- 

 tion other than the extremely improbable supposition that each seg- 

 ment is double. In all probability these structures are modified sen- 

 sory hairs, or they may be comparable to the movable spine-like struc- 

 tures found upon the legs of certain insects. Verhoeff, who adopts 

 Haase's, '89, view regarding the styli, homologizes them with the 

 coxal organs of the Myriopoda. 



As has been stated, Walton, '00, believes that the meron is a vestigial 

 leg, but serious doubt is cast upon this theory by the fact that one can 

 trace the formation of the meron as a coxal sclerite, which is either 

 not distinguishable from the rest of the coxa, or at most indistinctly 

 traceable, in the lower forms, but becomes detached by muscular ten- 

 sion in the highly specialized insects. The view that the tension of 

 the muscles attached to it causes the meron to become detached is 




1909.] 



NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



31 



strengthened by the fact that it occurs as a distinct sclerite only in the 

 segments which bear functional wings. Thus it seems to be absent 

 in the prothorax of all the insects which the writer has studied, and no 

 traces of it are to be found in the metathorax of the Diptera, although 

 it is well developed in the mesothorax of these insects. 



Since the mode of life is the same among insects and myriopods, and 

 as the legs of both are used in the same manner, it is but natural that 

 there should be a very marked convergence in the structure of these 

 organs. This, however, is not sufficient ground for attempting to 

 change the terminology applied to the segments of the insect leg, as 

 Verhoeff, '03-'04, has done. Even if it could be demonstrated that 

 the joints of the insect leg can be homologized with corresponding- 

 ones in the myriopods, the terminology for the leg segments of the 

 myriopods should be adapted to that of insects, as the latter has- 

 the right of priority and of widespread acceptance.

 is likewise slightly raised to show the first abdominal segment which is hidden 

 by the epimeron, and does not appear in Heymons' figure of Nepa (fig. 16). 



Fig. 16. — Heymons' figure of Nepa, slightly modified. The dotted lines indicate 

 the region corresponding to that shown in fig. 15. 



Of the leg segments only the coxa and trochanter need be here con- 

 sidered. The coxa is frequently divided into two regions, as has been 

 previously described. Verhoeff's, '03, term eucoxa (fig. 3, C y ), applied 

 to the anterior coxal region, seems preferable to Walton's, '00, "coxa 

 genuina," but for the posterior coxal region Walton's term meron has 




32 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



been here adopted. A narrow marginal area, the "coximarginal" 

 sclerite, is frequently separated from the rest of the coxa by a suture, 

 as is well shown in the Blattidae (pi. Ill, C m ), Corydalis (fig. 17), etc. 

 It is questionable whether this region corresponds to the area desig- 

 nated as " C m (?) " in fig. 18 of the Trichopteran thorax, but the matter 

 is of relatively slight importance. 



That portion of the furci-sternum later spoken of as the pedal region 

 (fig. 18, S 3& ) frequently occurs as an elongate wedge-shaped process 

 extending into the coxal region. In such cases the furci-sternum is 

 so closely connected with the coxal region that the coxa usually loses 

 much of its freedom of motion. This loss, however, is usually compen- 

 sated by the greater mobility of the trochanter. Although the tro- 

 chanter appears to consist of but one joint in many insects, the second 

 joint is frequently hidden within the coxa, so that the "ditrochleate" 

 condition is much commoner than is generally supposed. This fact has 

 led to the formulation of the theory that one of the segments of the 

 trochanter represents a second joint of the "meral" leg. As the 

 author of this theory has not yet published his results, the improbability 

 of such a hypothesis will not be discussed here. 



The question as to whether or not the trochanter (or any part of it) 

 is the upper portion of the femur, and the different theories regarding 

 its homology, have but little bearing upon a study of the thoracic 

 sclerites, and need not be further gone into here. 



The Sternum. — MacLeay, '30, as has been stated, proposes that 

 each segment is composed of four subsegments or annuli. Arguing 

 from the fact that the tergum.is divided into four regions, he states 

 that the sternum likewise "ought to be" divided into four regions, 

 and proposes for these the names prsesternum, sternum, sternellum, 

 and poststernellum. He has not figured, described or even seen these 

 regions, but merely assumes their existence because of the condition 

 found in the tergum. Indeed, Newport, '39, who adopts MacLeay's 

 theory, states that these regions cannot all be found in any living insect, 

 as the specialization and fusion of the subsegments have gone too far 

 to leave any traces of the subdivisions in the sternum. 



Despite Newport's statement to the contrary, four distinct sub- 

 divisions of the sternum are to be found in certain insects, as for exam- 

 ple in the thorax of Nemura (pi. I). The terminology proposed 

 by MacLeay has not been adopted for the following reasons: the 

 names presternum, siernum, sternellum, and poststernellum imply 

 a relation between these subdivisions of the sternum and the prse- 

 scutum, scutum, scutellum and postscutellum, as MacLeay intended 




1909.] 



NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



33 



that they should. This relation, however, does not exist, for these 

 subdivisions do not represent four annuli, as assumed by MacLeay. 

 Furthermore, there is this very serious objection to MacLeay 's termi- 

 nology, that the designation sternum cannot be applied to a subdivision 

 of the sternal region, since Audouin employed the name sternum to 

 designate the whole ventral region of the segment, and it is in the latter 

 sense that the term is everywhere used. Lastly, since MacLeay has 

 neither seen, figured nor described these regions, but merely assumes 

 their existence based ipon a fallacious hypothesis, his terminology is 

 not binding. 



Comstock, '02, although he makes no mention of MacLeay, has at- 

 tempted to apply MacLeay's terminology to the sternal region. Un-

fortunately both of Comstock's figures (pp. 24 and 25) are of the 

 metathoracic segment, and what he terms the sternellum is the first 

 abdominal sternum. This accounts for the fact that he found no 

 "poststernellum." 



The Presternum.— -The name presternum is the only one of Com- 

 stock's and MacLeay's terms here adopted, since only the presternum 

 in Comstock's figure of Pteronarcys (p. 24) has a corresponding region 

 in the sternum of Nemura (pi. I, S t ). This term, however, has 

 been adopted without reference to Meinert's, '67, presternum, men- 

 tioned in his description of Japyx. 



The Japygidse are such rare insects that the writer was unable to 

 procure a specimen for dissection, and it is therefore impossible to 

 state here, with any degree of certainty, to what extent the presternum 

 3

and poststernum of Meinert correspond to the regions here designated 

 as the spini- and furci-sternum. Meinert gives no description of his 

 prsB- and post-sternum, other than the brief statement that they are 

 chitinized double folds lying between the segments. Verhoeff, '04, 

 and Borner, '03, make no attempt to employ Meinert's terms in their 

 figures, but from a study of these illustrations one might hazard the 

 opinion that Meinert's presternum does not correspond to Comstock's, 

 '02, presternum at all, but is probably the furci-sternum, later 

 described. 



In all probability the presternum is merely a portion of the large 

 sternite lying behind it, and exists 'as a separate piece in but few insects. 

 It is usually the first sternite to disappear, and its small size makes it 

 of relatively tittle importance. 



The Basi-sternum. — Just behind the presternum is a large sternite 

 forming the greater part of the sternal region. This sclerite, which 

 may be termed the basi-sternum (pi. I, S 2 ), is frequently fused with 

 the anterior laterale and katepisternal complex to form the "sterno- 

 pleura" of Osten-Sacken, '84. The basi- and furci-sternum are 

 visually symmetrically divided by a longitudinal furrow — the " mid- 

 ventral" suture. 



The Furci-sternum. — Immediately caudad of the basi-sternum is a 

 somewhat smaller sternite, which bears the furca or internal forked 

 process of the sternum. On this account the sclerite in question has 

 been termed the furci-sternum. In the swiftly flying insects there is 

 usually an internal "mid-ventral lamella," or ridge corresponding to 

 the mid-ventral suture, and as this is frequently continuous with the 

 shaft of the furca, it may appear as though the base of the furcal shaft 

 arises in the basi-sternum. This, however, is only a secondary modi- 

 fication, for in the primitive forms the furci-sternum alone bears the 

 paired apophyses. Externally it is a comparatively easy matter to 

 distinguish between the basi-sternum and the furci-sternum, even when 

 these are not entirely separate sclerites, as traces of the "intrasternal" 

 suture (which separates the basi-sternal from the furci-sternal region) 

 are retained in a great number of insects. 



In the Gryllide the furci-sternum (which is very closely connected 

 with the basi-sternum) is bent inward, so that its surface forms an 

 angle with that of the basi-sternum. This bending inward of the furci- 

 sternum causes it to be concealed by the sclerites which follow it 

 and this doubtless accounts for the fact that Voss, '04, did not mention 

 this region in his description of the thorax of Gryllus. The furci- 

 sternum has been figured in the Coleoptera, but no attempt has been 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 35 



made to designate it by any especial term, except that Comstock, '04, 

 terms it the antecoxal piece. This, however, is not the antecoxal 

 piece of Comstock, '02, nor of Walton, '00, and most assuredly does 

 not represent the antecoxal plates of Leconte, '61. 



In the Blattidae (pi. Ill), the furci-sternum of the meso- and meta- 

 thorax is somewhat "T "-shaped, and the internal paired apophyses are 

 borne one at the end of each arm of the "T". Each of the outer 

 openings of the hollow apophyses is covered by a sclerite which may 

 be termed the "tegmentary sclerite" (pi. Ill, Tg). The function 

 of these "tegmentary" sclerites is doubtless to keep dust, etc., from 

 collecting in the hollows of the apophyses. Miall and Denny, '86, state 

 that there is no ante-furca (i.e., prothoracic furca) in the cockroach; 

 nevertheless paired apophyses which correspond to the meso- and 

 meta-thoracic furca are to be found in the prothorax, if sufficient care 

 be taken in searching for them. The specimen should be slit along 

 the mid-dorsal suture, placed in 10% caustic potash, and left in the 

 paraffin oven until the soft parts can be easily washed away by driving 

 currents of water against them with a pipette. If the soft parts are 

 removed with forceps the apophyses, which are very delicate and 

 somewhat transparent, are usually plucked off before one discovers 

 them. This doubtless accounts for the fact that these structures were 

 not found by Miall and Denny. 



The prothoracic furci-sternum of Nemura (pi. I, S' 3 ) is divided into 

 two pieces; in the Trichoptera (fig. 18, S' 3 ) it is a single plate, drawn out 

 longitudinally, while in the Blattidse (pi. Ill, S' 3 ) it is a somewhat 

 oval transverse sclerite. 



In the meso- and meta-thorax, the furci-sternum is frequently 

 separated from the basi-sternum merely by the "intra-sternal" suture. 

 The furci-sternum is usually connected with the katepimeral complex 

 by the narrow antecoxal laterale (fig. 3, L b ), and may likewise be 

 connected with the epimeron by a bridge-like strip extending behind 

 the leg. In the Trichoptera (fig. 18) this strip (S" 3 -Em") dips below 

 the surface of the body, and reappears just before it is joined with 

 the epimeron. In those insects in which the coxal cavity is enclosed 

 posteriorally the coxae are frequently closely approximated, and that 

 portion of the furci-sternum between them is folded together. This 

 is well shown in the Trichoptera (fig. 18), and in these insects the 

 "pedal region" of the furci-sternum (S" 3p ) extends along the mesal 

 surface of the coxa, with which it is very closely connected. 



It is perhaps of some interest to note that in the Trichoptera the 

 pleural suture is continued in the "coxal suture" (between the meron 




36 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



and eucoxa), and is extended through the pedal region of the furci- 

 sternum (i.e., the "furcal suture") and up the other side of the insect. 

 With the "intertergal" space (between the postscutellum and the 

 remainder of the tergum) it may separate the segment into two rings, 

 but, from reasons previously given, it is not at all probable that this 

 indicates that the segment is double. 



Behind the furci-sternum (S' 3 ) in Nemura (pi. I) are two plates 

 (^pf) which may be termed the post-f ureal sclerites. These occur in 

 but few insects, and are relatively unimportant. 



The Spini-sternum. — Behind the furci-sternum is a smaller sternite, 

 which bears an internal unpaired apophysis, the "spina," and may 

 hence be termed the spini-sternum. This sclerite varies greatly in size 

 and shape, and is never very large. 



The prothoracic spini-sternum is the most constant, and occurs in a 

 large number of insects. In the Blattidse (pi. Ill, £' 4 ) it is very long 

 and narrow, while the prothoracic spini-sternum of Nemura (pi. I, 

 S\) is drawn out transversely into two wing-like processes. In the 

 Trichoptera (fig. 18, S\) and Xyelidse it is very small, and in many 

 insects it is represented only by the endoskeletal "spina" or unpaired 

 pophysis. 



The prothoracic spini-sternum (pi. Ill, S' 4 ) usually lies just in front 

 <of the basi-sternum of the mesothorax, being much nearer to the meso- 

 thorax than to the prothorax. Again, in certain insects (Corydalis 

 for example) the mesothoracic spini-sternum is united with the meta- 

 thorax, but in each case the musculature clearly indicates to which 

 segment the sclerite in question belongs. 



In the Blattidae (pi. Ill, S'" 4 ) the metathoracic spini-sternum is a 

 distinct sclerite, but in Nemura (pi. I, £'" 4 ) it is united with the furci- 

 sternum, and in most insects it is indistinguishably fused with the 

 latter sternite. As has been mentioned, the prsesternum is usually 

 fused with the basi-sternum (except in a few insects such as Nemura, 

 Ectobia, etc.) and the spini-sternum frequently lies directly in front of 

 the basi-sternum. On this account it would seem very probable that 

 Meinert's, '67, prsesternum corresponds to the spini-sternum, rather 

 than the prsesternum of Comstock, '02, and the writer. This, however, 

 is mere supposition, and cannot be determined until specimens of 

 Japyx can be obtained for dissection. 



Amans, '85, divides the sternum into two regions, the ante- and post- 

 sternum. The former of these two regions may possibly correspond 

 to the prse- and basi-sternum, and the latter to the furci- and spini- 

 sternum, but it is impossible to determine this from Amans' descrip- 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 37 



tions, as he gives no boundaries for his two regions, other than the 

 statement that they are separated by the coxal cavities. His post- 

 sternum is apparently not the same as Meinert's, '67, and is surely not 

 the poststernum of Petri, '99, as the latter sclerite is the meron. 

 Amans' division of the sternum would be of no service in such insects 

 as Nemura, or in the Blattidae, where the coxal cavities do not divide 

 the sternum at all. On this account, and because the sternum is not 

 divided into two but into four sternites, Amans' terminology will not 

 be further considered. 



Voss, '04, states that the spini-sternum corresponds to Comstock's, 

 '02. sternellum; but, as we have seen, Comstock's, '02, sternellum is 

 the first abdominal sternum — except in the neck region, where his ster- 

 nellum and sternum are doubtless detached portions of the presternum. 

 If Comstock had found the four sternal regions, he would doubtless 

 have termed the spini-sternum the poststernellum, as he states (p. 25), 

 "A poststernellum corresponding to the postscutellum has not been 

 observed." 



The Intersegmentalia. — In front of the laterale, on either side 

 of the mesothorax of such insects as the Trichoptera, Xyelidae, etc., 

 is a sclerite which is doubtless a detached portion of the laterale. This 

 sclerite may be termed the prselaterale (fig. 18, 7 X ). Surrounding the 

 spiracle is a number of small plates, the "peritremal sclerites," and 

 between them and the pleuron of the preceding segment is a detached 

 portion of the pleuron, which may be termed the post-pleural sclerite 

 (7 P ). All of the above-mentioned sclerites will be included under 

 the general term intersegmentalia, as they lie in the intersegmental 

 membrane, more or less separated from the segment to which they 

 belong. 



Voss, '04, claims that the musculature of the first and second thoracic 

 spiracles indicates that they belong to the segment behind which they 

 are situated — that is, that the first is the prothoracic spiracle, and the 

 second is the mesothoracic one. The third spiracle Voss assigns to 

 the first abdominal segment, as do most other investigators. 



Heymons, '95, concludes from his embryological studies that the 

 spiracle does not belong to the segment preceding it, but to the segment 

 in front of which it is located. He states that in the early embryonic 

 stages, the primordia of the spiracles lie in the anterior portion of their 

 corresponding segments; as development proceeds, the spiracle ma} 7 

 migrate forward and become attached to the segment in front of it, 

 but this is only a secondary modification. 



Palmen, '77, proposed the theory that the first thoracic spiracle may

be prothoracic in some insects and mesothoracic in others, but this 

 view does not seem to have a very wide acceptance. 



The embryological proof seems to be in favor of Heymons view, 

 and it is certainly the case that the musculature of such insects as the 

 Blattidse indicates that the spiracles belong to the segment behind 

 them rather than to the preceding one. It is possible, however, to 

 designate the spiracles as the first thoracic spiracle, second thoracic 

 spiracle, etc., without specifying to which segment they belong, and 

 this usage has been here adopted. 



In the thorax of Japyx there occurs an extra spiracle, which has 

 given rise to much discussion, but all speculation as to its homology 

 can be of no value until the musculature and embryology of Japyx 

 have been carefully studied with a view to determining this point. 



In insects other than Japyx, most investigators now agree in desig- 

 nating the third spiracle as the first abdominal one. It would appear 

 that Latreille's, '20-'22, designating the first abdominal segment the 

 "segment mediaire" is responsible for much of the dispute which 

 later arose concerning this segment, especially in the Diptera and 

 arculeate Hymenoptera ; and it is hard to understand why certain 

 modern systematists — Schmiedeknecht, '07, for example — persist in 

 using Latreille's confusing terminology. The first abdominal segment 

 is the first abdominal segment, no matter where it is located, and if 

 it be designated by its proper name, there can be no dispute as to its 

 homology or that of its spiracle. 



The Cervictjm. — Between the head and the prothorax is a narrower 

 neck region whose softer walls give a greater freedom of motion for

40 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan.. 



are a number of plates which serve to strengthen its walls, and furnish 

 an articulation for the head (pi. Ill, C sv C s2 , etc.). The number of 

 these sclerites varies greatly, being the most numerous in the Orthop- 

 tera, while in certain Coleoptera they are entirely wanting. 



The neck region has been designated as the "Mikrothorax" by 

 Verhoeff, '02, who at first considered this as a fourth segment of equal 

 rank with the pro-, meso- and meta-thorax. < There appear to be very 

 grave doubts as to the correctness of this view, and' since every inves- 

 tigator who has dealt with this subject terms the region in question the 

 "neck," "Nacken," "cou," etc., according to the language in which 

 the article is written, it seems preferable to designate the neck by the 

 Latin term cervicum — a purely typographical designation, and one 

 which is already implied in the expression "cervical plates," applied 

 to its sclerites for more than eighty years. As has been stated, Ver- 

 hoeff, '02, terms the cervicum the "Mikrothorax," and at first con- 

 sidered it a fourth thoracic segment similar to the pro- meso-, and 

 meta-thorax. Later, however, he designated this "Mikrothorax" as 

 one of the so-called complementary segments (" Vordersegmente") 

 which he states can be found in front of each chief segment of the 

 thorax; and, in addition, he described the remains of an intercalary 

 segment in front of each of the above-mentioned thoracic segments. 



In the earlier works there has been much speculation as to the origin 

 of the cervical sclerites, and the question is still a very hotly debated 

 one. 



The first of these theories is that of Strauss-Durkheim, '28, who 

 states that in the neck region of the Forficulidse, one can find traces 

 of the sterna and pleura of two segments formerly existing between 

 the prothorax and the head. He had thus long ago expressed exactly 

 the same theory, founded upon the same insects, that Verhoeff uses to 

 illustrate his microthorax theory, yet Verhoeff states that "es klingt 

 zwar sonderbar, dass bei den von Hunderten von Forschern studierten 

 Insekten dergleichen (d. h. ein vorn am Thorax befindliches bisher 

 ubersehenes segment) noch gefunden werden soil, ist aber tatsachlich 

 so." 



The second theory is that of Huxley, '85. In describing the neck 

 plates he says: "I think it is probable that these cervical sclerites 

 represent the hindermost of the cephalic somites" — in other words, 

 he regards the cervicum as the labial segment. Comstock, '02, adopts 

 this view, and proposes that the appendages of the cervicum are the 

 second maxillae which leave their segment and, migrating forward, fuse 

 to form the labium. He likewise makes use of Carriere's, '98, theory, 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 41' 



that the salivary glands are modified tracheae, to explain the fact that 

 the prothorax has no spiracles. Comstock claims that the prothoracic 

 spiracles are drawn along with the migrating maxillae and, becoming- 

 united, form the opening of the salivary glands, into which their corre- 

 sponding tracheae have changed. He regards the lateral cervicals as 

 the episternum and epimeron of the labial segment, and the internal 

 process between these he explains as the endopleural apodeme of this 

 "segment." Voss, '04, arrived at much the same conclusion from his 

 study of the musculature, and Riley likewise considers that the cervical 

 sclerites belong to the second maxillary segment, from his embryological 

 investigations. 



The third theory is that of Newport, '39, who proposes that the 

 cervical sclerites are detached portions of the prothorax, and repre- 

 sent the paraptera (laterale?) of the meso- and meta- thorax. Borner, 

 '03, likewise considers that the cervicals are prothoracic plates which 

 have become detached from the sternal region of that segment. 



In an earlier paper (Crampton, '08) it was suggested that the cervi- 

 cals possibly correspond to the "intersegmentalia" found between the 

 pro- and meso-thorax, and that the internal hollow process between the 

 lateral cervicals might represent the remains of the trunk of a pro- 

 thoracic trachea. It is quite comprehensible that a strongly chitinized 

 tracheal stem, such for example as that of a Perlid, could serve as a 

 muscle support, and, furthermore, it is possible for muscles to become 

 attached to the tracheae without interfering with their respiratory 

 function, as is shown in certain Arachnoidea. In the case of the pro- 

 thoracic tracheae, it was proposed that their trunks, being in a favorable 

 position to serve as a support for the head muscles, were preserved by 

 a change of function, while the remaining portion of the tracheae would 

 be subjected to the same influences which caused the disappearance of 

 the tracheae in the buccal somites. 



This theory would seem no more improbable than Comstock's, '02, 

 view that the apodemes of the pro-, meso- and meta-thorax are tra- 

 cheal vestiges, and is by no means so startling as Carriere's, '98, theory 

 that the salivary glands are modified tracheae. Indeed, the views of 

 Palmen, '77, Hatschek, '77, Wheeler, '89, and Carriere, '98, who 

 claim that the tentorium (which likewise serves as a muscle support) 

 is composed of modified tracheae, render the theory that the cervical 

 apodeme is a modified trachea all the more probable; and Palmen's,. 

 '77, statement that there are traces of a tracheal invagination in the 

 neck region of the embryo likewise lends weight to the above-men- 

 tioned theory. However, upon looking into the subject more carefully. 




42 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



it would appear that these theories dealing with a change of function 

 have not been sufficiently well established, and it would be much 

 simpler to explain the origin of the cervical apodeme as a drawing 

 inward of a portion of the integument (or a corner of one of the sclerites) 

 due to muscular tension. 



Even if the theory of the tracheal nature of the cervical apodemes be 

 rejected, this does not preclude the possibility that the peritremal 

 sclerites which lay in front of the prothorax, may have taken part in 

 the formation of the cervical sclerites. The musculature of these 

 plates could admit of such an interpretation, and it would be only 

 natural that such sclerites should be the most developed in the cervical 

 region, where they would serve not only as supports for the attachment 

 of the head muscles, but also as strengthening plates for the membrane 

 of the neck. 



Verhoeff's, '02, theory seems very improbable from the fact that no 

 traces of a " mikrothoracic " segment are to be found in the embryo, 

 and none of the segmental structures show any indications of a dupli- 

 cation. On the other hand, if the theory that the cervical sclerites 

 represent the labial segment be accepted, how can one account for the 

 occurrence of similar plates in front of the meso- and meta-thorax, 

 for these surely cannot be likewise interpreted as labial segments? 



Voss, '04, attempts to show from the musculature that the cervicum 

 is the labial segment, but it would appear that the cervical muscles 

 are for the most part attached to the occiput, and not to the labium. 

 Furthermore, Riley, '04, himself states that the pleura of the labium 

 are in the occiput region, yet he speaks of the lateral cervicals as the 

 pleurites of the second maxillae, without giving any reason for thus 

 assigning them to the labial segment. 



It is possible that certain detached portions of the labial segment 

 may enter into the formation of the cervical sclerites, but it is not any 

 more correct on this account to designate the cervicum as the labial 

 segment, than it would be to term the intersegmentalia between the 

 first two thoracic segments, the prothorax. The ventral cervical 

 sclerites, termed by Comstock, '02, the labial sternum and sternellum, 

 appear to be detached portions of the prothoracic sternum, while the 

 lateral cervicals may possibly correspond to the "intersegmentalia" 

 between the pro- and meso-thorax, and the dorsal cervicals are probably 

 detached portions of the pronotum. 12 



12 In assuming that the cervicals are formed partially from prothoracic scler- 

 ites, it must be borne in mind that certain other factors, such as mechanical 

 friction, etc., may have produced certain of these sclerites. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 43 



In most Hymenoptera, the prothoracic pleura are very closely con- 

 nected with the cervical sclerites, and in many insects of this family 

 the pleura of the pro thorax are almost indistinguishably fused with 

 the lateral cervicals. On this account the term cervico-propleura 

 has been here applied to the lateral portions of this region in the 

 Hymenoptera. 



If one observe a Macroxyela (or a Tenthredo), a wasp and an ant, 

 in the order above mentioned, it may readily be seen that the cervico- 

 propleura (fig. 13, C.Pl) gradually approach one another on the ventral 

 surface, and almost completely conceal the small presternum (fig. 14, 

 S'). In such a case, the ventral portion of the cervico-propleura is 

 almost without exception incorrectly termed the " presternum, " and 

 even so careful an observer as Janet, '98, has been deceived in this 

 respect. Indeed, Rheinhard, '65, terms the entire cervico-propleuron 

 the presternum, as does Schmiedeknecht, '07, and a number of 

 others. 



As has been stated, the cervical sclerites may represent the "inter- 

 segmentalia, " and, in addition, certain of the neck plates doubtless 

 owe their origin to mechanical friction. This brings us to the question 

 of the formation of sclerites in general. The prevalent opinion is that 

 the segments originally consisted of chitinized rings, which became 

 split between the pleura and tergal region to accommodate the wing; 

 and the pleura became separated from the sternal region to make room 

 for the leg. This view, however, is not borne out by the facts of onto- 

 genetic development, nor by the results. of comparative morphological 

 study. In all of the very active larvae studied, the sclerites of the ster- 

 num and pleura form as islands (pi. IV) which later unite to form the 

 chitinous integument. Again, in the adult stages of the lowest insects, 

 such as Japyx for example, even though there are no wings present, the 

 segments are not solid rings interrupted only at the base of the leg; 

 but consist for the most part of small individual sclerites. It is like- 

 wise the case that within the same family the sclerites of the general- 

 ized forms are more numerous and distinct, while in the more specialized 

 forms there is a marked tendency toward a fusion of the sclerites to 

 form a solid ring; and even the segments themselves tend to become 

 closely united. 



With regard to the origin of the sclerites, there are a number of fac- 

 tors which might give rise to such chitinous plates. Among the chief 

 of these causes is doubtless the stimulus of muscular tension, which 

 would serve to produce a chitinized thickening of the integument at 

 the points of origin and insertion. The sclerites thus formed would not 




44 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



only serve as firmer supports than the softer yielding integument about 

 them, but would likewise serve as protective plates. Contact with 

 external objects and mechanical irritation, such, for example, as the 

 rubbing of one part upon another, doubtless play no inconsiderable role 

 in the production of the sclerites. This was well illustrated in the case 

 of a young cricket, whose developing wing pads, by rubbing on the 

 tergum upon which they rested, left their outlines distinctly imprinted 

 in its integument. 



In addition to the formation of chitinous areas in the integument, 

 by the stimulus of its tension, muscular stress may likewise bring about 

 the breaking up of the large chitinous plates, or cause their division 

 into smaller regions by producing the infolding of hollow ridges, as is 

 shown in the tergum 13 and pleura. Again, it is quite evident that 

 portions of chitinous regions may become detached by muscular ten- 

 sion and drawn into another region, as is shown in the case of the 

 "migration" of the meron; such instances, however, are very rare, 

 and this method would consequently play an unimportant role in 

 sclerite formation. 



However, the method of sclerite formation, the theories of segmental 

 duplication, etc., are questions of minor interest, as the purpose of 

 this paper is to deal with the comparison of the sclerites in the adult 

 insect. With regard to the homologizations and terminology at present 

 in vogue, it may readily be seen that entomologists are by no means 

 agreed in these matters. Furthermore, the views here set forth fre- 

 quently differ very radically from those of other investigators, and on 

 this account the following list, which to some extent anticipates certain 

 points which will be brought out in a subsequent publication, may be 

 of some service, not only to furnish a resume of the synonyms, etc., 

 applied to the various sclerites, but also to give a brief outline of the 

 results here reached : —

 the term thorax to the notum or tergum, but these obsolete usages need 

 not be further discussed here.

ACTION OF CHEMICAL SOLUTIONS ON BUD DEVELOPMENT: AN EXPERI- 

 MENTAL STUDY OF ACCLIMATIZATION. 



BY JOHN W. HARSHBERGER, PH.D. 



The phenomena of vegetation lend themselves to experimental 

 study. This experimentation is necessary, because the laws which 

 control the periodicity of plants can be determined only by altering 

 the conditions under which such plants grow. Interest in the periodic 

 growth of plants is perhaps keenest in the Spring, when everyone is 

 observing, in a more or less detailed manner, the gradual awakenment 

 of vegetation. The opening of shrub and tree buds has, as a result of 

 this human interest, long engaged the attention of botanists. The 

 phenomena of bud opening, and the laws to be deduced therefrom, 

 have not been studied experimentally. Every student has been struck 

 by the orderly sequence of the process in any particular district or climate. 

 Each species seems to fill its allotted place in the line of bud develop- 

 ment. The question arises, is this sequence due to heredity, to the 

 character of the reserve food, or the disposition of this reserve food 

 in the buds and twigs of the plant, or is it due solely to the climatic 

 conditions, such as temperature and humidity? The experiments 

 which follow will furnish data which it is hoped will contribute to the 

 answer of the above questions. The only other experiments of a 

 similar nature that have come to the writer's knowledge are those of 

 DeCandolle, mentioned by Schimper 1 as follows: "Zweige von Holz- 

 gewachsen zeigen das gleiche Verhalten wie Samen. A. de Candolle 

 trieb Zweige von Populus alba, Carpinus betulus, Catalpa bignonise- 

 folia [bignonioides ?] und Liriodendron tulipifera die sich theils in 

 MontpelliertheilsinGenf entwickelt hatten vom 4 Februar an in einen 

 Raume dessen Temperatur wahrend der Dauer des Versuches zwischen 

 + 7° und +10° schwankte. Die Genfer Zweige entwickelten ihre 

 Laub-knospen fruher als die aus Montpellier stammenden." 



Experiments of the First Year. 



Eight species were studied the first year in which the experiments 

 were conducted. Twigs from Liriodendron tulipifera, Quercus palustris, 



1 Schimper, A. F. W., Pflanzengeogrophie auf phi/siologischer Grundlage, p. 56. 




58 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



Populus monilifera, Tilia americana, Magnolia conspicua, JEsculus 

 hippocastanum, Salix babylonica and Forsythia viridissima were placed 

 in various chemical solutions described below, and at the same time 

 plants near the University were observed under more normal conditions 

 out of doors. Twigs cut from these trees were placed in the chemical 

 solution on March 1, 1907. Under each species will be mentioned 

 the chemical solutions used and the reaction which took place. The 

 date of the reaction will be given in each particular case. The species 

 of the first year's experimentation are arranged in the order of their 

 response. The plants were kept in a greenhouse where the tempera- 

 ture range was about 25 degrees. At night the temperature descended 

 to 65° F., while on sunny middays it rose as high as 90° F. 



Forsythia viridissima. — The following chemical solutions were 

 used with this species. One per cent, chromic acid filled several of the 

 bottles; ordinary stock picric acid diluted four times with water; 

 ammonium nitrate (two grams) dissolved in 200 cubic centimeters of 

 water; five decigrams of sodium chloride in fifty cubic centimeters of 

 water; five drops chemically pure nitric acid in fifty cubic centimeters 

 of water ; menthol water ; two bottles filled with 800 cubic centimeters 

 of filtered water; two grams ammonium sulphate in 600 cubic centi- 

 meters of water; 100 cubic centimeters of ether in 500 cubic centimeters 

 of water ; 200 cubic centimeters of chemically pure ammonium hydrate 

 in 1,000 cubic centimeters of water; a saturated solution of corrosive 

 sublimate in 1,000 cubic centimeters of water; ten drops of chemically 

 pure hydrochloric acid in fifty cubic centimeters of water. 



One week after the experiments were begun buds of this species 

 showed a reaction. The most marked was with the ammonium 

 hydrate solution when, on March 8, it was found that all of the buds 

 above the middle ones were well opened, but the leaves remained 

 tightly folded. There was a steady advance in this solution until 

 March 20. On March 11 the flower buds were ready to open, and 

 on March 15, four days later, the buds were expanded, while on March 

 18 the flowers had withered and a few green leaves had appeared. 

 After March 25 there was no advance, and on March 28 the twigs were 

 dead. Response was shown on March 8 by the twigs in picric acid, 

 ammonium nitrate, sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid, ammonium 

 sulphate, ether water, corrosive sublimate and pure water. The 

 most marked response was in the solution with five drops of hydro- 

 chloric acid, where the buds had burst, and in the picric acid, where 

 the three topmost buds had burst. The response in the other cases 

 was shown by an easement of the buds. In the pure water the buds 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 59 



were green. On March 8 no reaction was shown by the twigs in the 

 chromic acid, nitric acid, menthol water and one bottle of filtered water. 

 In fact the twigs in the nitric acid did not respond and were dead by 

 March 20. The buds, however, in the menthol water, chromic acid and 

 filtered water had responded on March 11. The subsequent history 

 of the twigs in the different solutions is as follows : 



Chromic Acid. — March 11: The buds of the two upper nodes were 

 developed. March 15: The two topmost buds were expanded, but 

 the leaves were still folded.. March 18: The leaves of the top pair of 

 buds were fully expanded, with the terminal bud one and a half inches 

 long. March 25: No advance. 



Picric Acid. — March 11: Upper buds were green. March 15: A 

 few end buds were green, but not opened. March 18: Upper buds 

 burst, leaves green. March 20: Leaves hardly unfolded. March 25: 

 No advance. March 28: Leaves hardly unfolded. March 25: No 

 advance. March 28: Twigs dead. 



Ammonium nitrate. — March 11 : All of the buds were burst and some 

 of the leaves were expanded. March 15 : Nearly all of the buds showed 

 leafy branches one and a half inches long, with two to three pairs of 

 leaves expanded. March 18: All of the green leaves were spotted and 

 unhealthy looking. March 20 : All of the expanded leaves were dead, 

 and on March 28 all of the twigs were dead. 



Sodium chloride. — March 1 1 : The three upper buds were enlarged 

 and ready to burst, March 15, March 18, March 20, March 25: No 

 advance in the development of these buds took place, and on March 

 28 the twigs w T ere dead. 



Hydrochloric Acid (five-drop solution). — March 11: The buds were 

 burst open, but the leaves were still folded together; only the lower- 

 most leaf was expanded. March 15: The upper two pairs of buds had 

 grown to a branch two inches long, with four pairs of opposite leaves 

 unfolded. March 18, March 20: All leaves of the branches expanded. 

 March 25, March 28, April 1 : No advance. April 5 : Twig dead. 



Menthol Water.— March 11: Middle buds burst. March 15: Three 

 buds were green, but not fully opened. March 18, March 25, March 28, 

 April 1 : No advance. April 5 : Twig dead. 



Filtered Water {A). — If the twig in this experiment is contrasted 

 with the twig in the other bottle of water, it is evident that its vitality 

 must have been impaired in some way before the experiments began, 

 hence the results obtained. On March 8 there was no response, as in 

 the other case March 11. The middle and lower buds had burst, the 

 leaves were flat but still erect. March 15: All of the buds had devel- 




60 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



oped into leafy branches two and a half inches long. March 18: All 

 of the branches measured two and a half inches long. March 20 : Slow 

 advance. March 25, March 28, April 1 : No advance. April 5 : Twigs 

 withered. 



(B) March 11 : Leaf buds eased, two flower buds were ready to open. 

 March 15: All of the flower buds were open, leaf buds one-half inch 

 long. March 18: All of the branches were green and two inches long. 

 March 20: The green branches were slowly growing. March 25, 

 March 28: The twigs and leaves were making rapid growth. April 1, 

 April 5, April 13: The growth continued. 



Ammonium sulphate. — March 11: One flower bud showed signs of 

 opening. March 15: Three flower buds advanced to stage of the first, 

 but still tightly closed, no leaf buds open. March 18, March 20, March 

 25: No advance. March 28: Twig dead. 



Corrosive sublimate. — March 11 : Lower pair of leaves in each of the 

 leaf buds were expanded. March 15: Branches were two inches long 

 and three pairs of leaves expanded. March 18: Branches two to two 

 and one-half inches long, flowers all withered. March 20: Leaves 

 of twig all flat. March 25 : Leaves were all expanded and had grown 

 in size. March 28 : Leaves began to wither. April 1 : Twigs unhealthy. 



Hydrochloric Acid (ten-drop solution). — March 11: Middle buds 

 of twig eased. March 15: Buds were three-quarters of an inch long, 

 leaves were not unfolded. March 18: Three buds were burst, but on 

 March 20 no advance in these buds was shown. March 25, 2 8,' April 1 : 

 No advance in twig. April 5: Twig dead. 



Magnolia conspicua. — Only two solutions were used in experi- 

 menting with the twigs of this tree. Two grams of ammonium nitrate 

 were dissolved in 200 cubic centimeters of water. Filtered water was 

 also used as a control. On March 8 the twigs did not show response in 

 either liquid. The first response was shown on March 11. 



Ammonium nitrate. — March 11: The large terminal bud was burst, 

 white petals shown at the base. March 15: Bud opened, but no ad- 

 ditional development. March 18: No advance. March 20: Termi- 

 nal buds unhealthy. March 20: All the buds were dead. 



Filtered Water. — March 8: No response. March 11: Flowers fully 

 open with the petals reflexed, but the stamens still closed. March 15: 

 Flower buds withered. March 18 : First foliage leaf expanded. March 

 20 : The twig was a little more advanced. March 25, March 28, April 1 : 

 Twig was dead. 



iEscuLUs hippocastanum. — Five solutions were used with the horse 

 chestnut, viz., five drops of hydrochloric acid in fifty cubic centimeters

of water; five drops of chemically pure nitric acid in fifty cubic centi- 

 meters of water; three bottles contained filtered water. 



Hydrochloric Acid. — March 11: Buds not burst, but resin abundant 

 and more fluid. March 15, March 18, March 20: No change reported 

 in the record of this branch. March 25 : Bud burst at tip. March 28 : 

 Bud nearly fully burst, leaves still tightly folded. April 1, April 5: 

 No change. April 13 : Twig dead.

 of water; saturated corrosive sublimate solution diluted in 1,000 cubic 

 centimeters of water. 




62 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



No response was noticed in any of the twigs on March 8 and March 

 11, except in the case of the twig in ether water which showed a slight 

 easement of the upper buds. This stimulus was only a temporary one, 

 because on March 11 no enlargement was noticeable. On March 15, 

 the twigs in water, menthol water, ether water, ammonium hydrate, 

 ammonium sulphate and corrosive sublimate had responded and the 

 extent of this response will be indicated in what follows. It should 

 be noted, however, that the buds on the twigs on March 15 in the ammo- 

 nium hydrate solution had burst and the leaves were about to unfold, 

 while the buds of the twigs in the filtered water, in the corrosive sub- 

 limate and in the ammonium sulphate were just beginning to burst 

 open. 



Chromic Acid (one per cent). — No response whatever on any of the 

 dates. 



Water {A). — March 15: Buds enlarged and green, but not open. 

 March 18: Large buds burst, leaves about to unfold. March 20: 

 Lateral buds open, one leaf began to unfold. March 25: Lateral buds 

 with first leaves partly unfolded, terminal buds burst. March 28:-

 water. There was no response shown in any of the twigs until March 

 15. The twigs in the chromic acid, ten-drop hydrochloric acid solu- 

 tion and in ether water showed no response during the entire course 

 of the experiments. The record obtained from the other twigs is as 

 follows :

66 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



nal bud fully expanded. March 28 : The twig was found dead, because 

 the water had evaporated from the jar. 



Corrosive Sublimate. — March 15: Bud scales eased. March 18: 

 Buds nearly all burst. March 20 : Half of the folded green leaves seen 

 in the partially open bud. March 25 : One to three leaves were found 

 fully expanded. March 28: All of the buds were burst, with one to 

 three leaves fully expanded, flat and large. April 1 : Twigs gone bad. 



Quercus paltjstris. — The chemicals used were: Two grams of 

 ammonium nitrate dissolved in 200 cubic centimeters of water ; five 

 decigrams of sodium bicarbonate dissolved in fifty cubic centimeters 

 of water; five decigrams of sodium chloride dissolved in fifty cubic 

 centimeters of water ; 200 cubic centimeters of chemically pure ammo- 

 nium hydrate dissolved in one liter of water; saturated solution of 

 corrosive sublimate in one liter of water; two water control experi- 

 ments were inaugurated. 



The twigs placed in the ammonium nitrate, sodium bicarbonate, 

 sodium chloride, ammonium sulphate, and ammonium hydrate solu- 

 tions made no response by the opening of the buds. Those, however, 

 in the solution of corrosive sublimate showed signs of response on 

 March 25, when the terminal bud showed signs of elongation. On 

 March 28, three days after, the terminal bud had burst and the leaves 

 were ready to unfold. On April 1 the twigs began to show signs of 

 going bad. In water the response was more marked than in the corro- 

 sive sublimate solution, for on March 25 the terminal bud had burst, 

 but the leaves were still enclosed in the stipular scales. On March 28 

 the leaves had nearly expanded, and on April 1 the leaves were fully 

 expanded and the new shoots 100 to 127 millimeters long. 



Summary of the Experiments of the First Year. 



The experiments conducted the first year with twigs in various 

 solutions throw considerable light upon the conditions which influ- 

 ence the flow of sap in plants. Strasburger set the cut ends of trees 

 in tubs containing copper sulphate solution. He found that the 

 poison ascended to the leaves a distance in the tallest trees of twenty- 

 one meters. If such a violent protoplasmic poison ascends the trunks 

 of trees, it is clear that they must kill all of the cells lying in the path 

 of its ascent. Strasburger concluded that the living cells of the stem 

 were not necessary to the ascent of the sap, as a result of the above- 

 mentioned experiment with copper sulphate. Strasburger also killed 

 portions of the stems of living trees by heat, and yet the upper living 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA 67 



and leafy portion was found to remain turgid for a few days. Another 

 experiment, which was held to negative the theory of protoplasmic 

 activity, was that in which boiling water was poured on the root, when 

 the plant continued to respire in spite of the roots having been killed. 

 These experiments of Strasburger are negatived by the experiments 

 with the twigs in the various chemical solutions previously described. 

 As before indicated, the response of the twigs in the most susceptible 

 instance did not take place until a week after the twigs were placed 

 in the chemical solutions. After the first response, the opening of. the 

 buds progressed steadily until the leaves had fully expanded. In 

 some instances the branch grew considerably in length after the open- 

 ing of the buds had started. As the experimental data prove, many 

 twigs did not respond but were killed outright, as illustrated by the 

 twigs of the Carolina poplar, Populus monilifera, in the ten-drop hydro- 

 chloric acid solution, or as in the case of Quercus palustris in the sodium 

 bicarbonate, sodium chloride and ammonium hydrate. Many twigs 

 which responded at first by the enlargement or even bursting of the 

 buds afterwards made no advance and were eventually killed, and 

 ultimately most of the twigs not in water, but with their ends immersed 

 in the chemical solutions, died after the buds had dried up or the 

 leaves had wilted. This seems to indicate that the chemicals first 

 acted as a stimulus on the twigs; this was followed by the ascent of 

 water, by the suctional activity of the living cells of the twig and bud, 

 while the poisons lagged behind. As long as any of the cells remained 

 alive in the upper part of the twigs and in the buds they maintained 

 their suctional activity. Bose, 2 by a series of elaborate and pains- 

 taking experiments, has shown after the administration of a poison 

 at the cut end of a branch or petiole that successive zones are killed 

 one after another, and that the death of a point below does not stop the 

 suction above. He says: "It is evident that the application of poison 

 at the root or cut end of a stem does not in general arrest suction until 

 the whole plant is killed." The records of his newly devised shoshun- 

 graph indicate that the final arrest occurs after an appropriately long- 

 period. That a poison can easily pass through killed tissue owing to 

 the suctional response of cells higher up, Bose proved in his experi- 

 ments on Desmodium, when he placed the cut end of a petiole in copper 

 sulphate solution. In this case there are areas which during the 

 ascent of the poison react visibly by the motile indications of the 



2 Bose, Jagadis Chunder, Plant Response as a Means of Physiological Investi- 

 gation, 1906, p. 385. 




68 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [Feb., 



pul vini of the inserted lateral leaflets. Bose by his experiments proved 

 that the ascent of sap is brought about, not by any localized group of 

 cells in a particular region, but by cells which extend throughout the 

 length of the plant. Even after some of these have died, therefore, 

 by the access of the poison, those above are still active, and will con- 

 tinue to exhibit suction until they in their turn are finally killed. It 

 is thus evident that the movement of ascent cannot be completely 

 abolished until the poison has reached effectively the very top. As 

 all the living cells are actively concerned in the work of suction, this 

 conveyance of poison to the top of the plant is what was to have been 

 expected. Only after such conveyance indeed could permanent arrest 

 possibly take place. Bearing these facts in mind, the action of the 

 chemicals on the various twigs used in my experiments become very 

 much simplified, and, instead of being very complex and unintelligible 

 phenomena, became reducible to one or two simple kinds of activity. 



Another important principle to be deduced from the experiments 

 of the first and also of the second year is, that the experimenter is 

 unable to disturb the natural sequence of bud opening by the stimulus 

 imparted to the twigs by the various chemical solutions. In only 

 one or two instances did the chemical seem to react upon the buds 

 and cause their enlargement out of the usual sequence. These cases 

 were with Forsythia viridissima twigs in the ammonium hydrate solu- 

 tions and in the five-drop hydrochloric acid solution. The response 

 was appreciably earlier and greater than with the twigs in filtered water 

 alone, or in the chemical solutions. The Populus monilijera twigs 

 in the ether water responded seven days in advance of the other 

 twigs placed under various experimental conditions. The results 

 obtained seem to indicate that the chemicals do not influence either 

 the time or the order of the response, but that this time and sequence 

 depend upon some factor not directly influenced by the environment 

 or by the experimental conditions. One then looks to the hereditary 

 influence which determines the time and the sequence of bud develop- 

 ment. Under hereditary influence we may include the minuter 

 structure of the plant which determines what the character of the 

 response must be. Perhaps it is a structural preparedness and the 

 character of the reserve food which determines the sequence of bud 

 development. To determine this point a study was made of the 

 microscopic anatomy of the experimental twigs. These are described 

 in the order in which the twigs responded in their bud development. 

 The twigs were cut on March 13, 1907, before the advent of Spring, 

 which occurred on March 30 and 31. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 69 



(1) Forsythia viridissima. — The iodine test showed the pith cells 

 crowded with starch, as also the cortex cells between the bast fibers, 

 as also the medullary ray cells. Fehling's test gave no reaction. 



(2) Magnolia conspicua. — On treating the sections with iodine 

 starch was found in the medullary ray cells and not any in the cortex. 

 Fehling's test for sugar gave no reaction. 



(3) ^Esculus hippocastanum. — Starch occurs in the protoxylem 

 region, in the inner part of the medullary rays. No starch was found 

 in the cortex cells and no reaction was produced with Fehling's solu- 

 tion. 



(4) Populus monilifera. — The iodine test showed the presence of 

 starch in the cortex. Fehling's test for sugar gave no result. 



(5) Liriodendron tulipifera.— Starch is present in the younger 

 and older portions of the stem in the cortex cells. No sugar reaction. 



(6) Salix babylonica. — Iodine showed the presence of starch in 

 the cortex cells and medullary ray cells. No starch was found in the 

 pith. Fehling's sugar test was negative. 



(7) Tilia Americana. — Small starch grains were found in the cor- 

 tex of a one-year old stem. No starch was seen in the cortex of old 

 stems. In water the sections became strongly mucilaginous. Feh- 

 ling's solution gave no reaction. 



(8) Quercus PALUSTRis. — Starch was found in the pith, medullary 

 ray cells and in the wood-parenchyma cells. No starch was detected 

 in the cortex. Fehling's solution gave no starch reaction. 



• As far as these microscopic studies throw light upon the state of 

 the plant's preparedness, they seem to support the view that the more 

 prepared a plant is and the more responsive its protoplasm is to the 

 influence of external conditions the earlier is its response. For the 

 response of Quercus palustris with deep-seated starch is much more 

 sluggish than the response of the twigs where the starch occurs in the 

 cortex. This relationship of response to the position of the reserve 

 food should not, however, be pushed too far, as the protoplasm of the 

 twigs and that of the cells of the preformed buds may be influenced 

 without any transformation of the reserve supplies of food. We do 

 find, however, a sequential development of the buds and, as far as the 

 experiments go to show, that sequential development is not disturbed 

 by the chemicals that are used. The course of bud development, 

 therefore, depends upon the state of preparedness of the twig and bud, 

 and not on the environmental conditions which surround the plants. 

 Heat is the great factor which determines the opening of the buds. 

 If the plant has the requisite supply of moisture, heat will accelerate the 




70 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



opening of buds ; but buds of different species of plants if exposed to 

 the same temperature preserve the order of their bud development; 

 but the time interval is very much lessened if the amount of heat is 

 increased. This was exemplified by a double climbing white rose 

 growing against the side of a house with a chimney placed in the 

 outside wall. The heat of the chimney caused the buds over the chim- 

 ney bricks to open at least a week or ten days before those on the rest 

 of the bush showed any signs of development. All of the buds in the 

 rosebush were equally prepared to open, but only those did so which 

 received the stimulating effect of the heated brick surface. 



Experiments of the Second Year. 



The second year of experimentation began with a plan for the 

 enlargement of the scope of the work of the previous year. In order 

 to test the question whether chemical solution could alter the sequence 

 of bud development if the buds were obtained from different geographic 

 localities, and in order to test whether the twigs obtained from south- 

 ern latitudes would or would not respond more or less quickly than the 

 twigs from northern latitudes to the new environmental conditions, 

 a circular letter was addressed to all of the agricultural 'experiment 

 stations and to a few private individuals in the forest-covered portion 

 of the eastern United States from the Gulf States' to Maine. The letter 

 read as follows: 



My dear Sir: — In continuation of a study which I have begun on the influence 

 of chemicals on the opening of buds, I write to ask if you will supply me with 

 twigs of one or several of the following varieties of fruit trees: apple: Baldwin, 

 Early Harvest, Maiden Blush, Red Astrachan, Winesap, York Imperial; cherry: 

 Black Heart, Governor Wood, Morello; peach: Early Crawford, Late Crawford, 

 Oldmixon (free) ; pear: Duchess de An gouleme, Bartlett, Clapp lavorite, Flemish 

 Beauty, Kieffer, Seckel. These twigs I should like cut so as to show the last three 

 years of terminal growth. In addition I should like twigs of the same age of 

 Quercus palustris (the pin oak), IAriodendron tulipifera (the tulip poplar), Populus 

 monilifera (the Carolina poplar), Acer rubrum (the red maple), Msculus hippo- 

 castanum (the horse chestnut), Forsythia viridissima, Tilia americana (the linden), 

 Magnolia conspicua (Yulan magnolia). If not too much trouble please send 

 them so as to reach me on January 15, 1908, when I expect to start all of the 

 twigs received.

each station are given in the accompanying table. It will be seen 

 that the material came from as far south as Alabama and as far north 

 as Massachusetts, and that the twigs sent by the correspondents were 

 abundant enough to represent, in many cases, the entire geographic 

 range of the variety studied. Thus the Red Astrachan apple twigs 

 came from Pennsylvania State College; College Park, Maryland; 

 Geneva, New York; Storrs, Connecticut, and Auburn, Alabama. 



Bundles of twigs were sent by express in boxes or protected by bur- 

 lap. Upon their receipt at the University they were kept in a light, 

 cool, airy cellar until all of the packages had been received. The 

 experiments, as far as practicable, were started at the same time,. 

 viz., on the afternoon of January 22, 1908, and on the morning of 

 January 23, 1908. The bottles with chemical solutions had been 

 prepared previously. The jars with the twigs were placed in a green- 

 house the temperature of which ranged from about 70° F. at night to 

 90° or 95° in the daytime. The latter temperature was reached with 

 a bright midday sun. The observation continued uninterruptedly 

 from January 23, 1908, to March 14, when the experimentation vir- 

 tually stopped. Only one change was made in the fluids, viz., on 

 February 14, 1908, when the evaporated water was resupplied, without 

 the addition of any fresh chemical substance. 



The chemical solutions used were made as follows: 



Corrosive sublimate. — Strong solution : Ten grams in 850 cubic centi- 

 meters of water. Weak solution: Five grams in same amount of 

 water. 



Copper sulphate. — Strong solution: Ten grams in 850 cubic centi- 

 meters of water. Weak solution: Five grams in same amount of 

 water. 



Sodium chloride. — Strong solution: Ten grams in 850 cubic centi- 

 meters of water. Weak solution: Five grams in same amount of 

 water. 



Ammonium nitrate. — Strong solution : Ten grams in 600 cubic centi- 

 meters of water. Weak solution : Five grams in 600 cubic centimeters 

 of water. 



Ammonium oxalate. — Strong solution: Ten grains in 600 cubic 

 centimeters of water. Weak solution : Five grams in same amount of 

 water. 



Ammonium oxalate. — Strong solution: Ten grams in 600 cubic centi- 

 meters of water. Weak solution: Five grams in same amount of 

 water. 



Potassium chloride. — Strong solution : Ten grams in 900 cubic centi- 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 73 



meters of water. Weak solution: Five grams in same amount of 

 water. 



Sodium bicarbonate. — StrongT solution : Ten grams in 900 cubic- 

 centimeters of water. Weak solution : Five grams in the same amount 

 of water. 



Potassium bisulphate = Acid sulphate. — Strong solution: Ten grams 

 in 850 cubic centimeters of water. Weak solution : Five grams in the 

 same amount of water. 



Hydrochloric Acid. — Strong solution: Ten cubic centimeters in 

 800 cubic centimeters of water, only one-half of this liquid being used 

 in the experiment. Weak solution: Five cubic centimeters in 800 

 cubic centimeters of water, only one-half of this liquid was used. 



Acetic Acid. — Strong solution: Ten cubic centimeters in 800 cubic 

 centimeters of water, one-half this quantity of liquid was used. Weak 

 solution : Five cubic centimeters in 800 cubic centimeters of water used 

 in one-half the amount of liquid. 



Nitric Acid. — Strong solution: Ten grams used prepared as above. 

 Weak solution: Five grams as above. 



Chromic Acid. — Strong solution: Ten cubic centimeters of four per 

 cent, acid in 500 cubic centimeters of water, one-half of the amount 

 of liquid being used. Weak solution: Five cubic centimeters of four 

 per cent, acid in 500 cubic centimeters of water, liquid used in half 

 amounts. 



Besides the use of chemical solution water controls were instituted, 

 the twigs from each station being placed in a separate jar of water. 

 Thus there were jars for the twigs from the agricultural experiment 

 stations mentioned above. Each of the twigs (some 900 in all) was 

 labelled with a tag on which the locality and the name of the twig- 

 were recorded by a selected abbreviation, thus Pas A 2 indicated that 

 the branch was from an Early Harvest Apple sent from Pennsyl- 

 vania State College, and that NYI W 25 was a twig of the linden 

 (Tilia americana) from Ithaca, New York. The results obtained 

 with the twigs from the northern and southern States in the water 

 and in the various chemical solutions, with the date and the character 

 of the response, may be given as follows: 



Apple (Baldwin). — 



Corrosive sublimate. — Twigs from Geneva, New York, showed no- 

 response in strong corrosive sublimate solution. Twigs from Amherst^ 

 Massachusetts, in weak corrosive sublimate responded on January 31 

 by the easing of the leaf buds; on February 3 the leaf buds had burst; 




74 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



on February 4 the first leaf had unfolded ; on February 1 1 all the leaves 

 had unfolded; on February 14 the first leaf had withered, and on 

 February 21 all the leaves had withered. The twigs from Lafayette, 

 Indiana, responded by the bursting of the buds on February 3; on 

 February 5 the first leaf had unfolded; on February 8 all the leaves 

 had unfolded ; on February 1 1 the first leaf had withered ; on February 

 14 all the leaves had withered.

 not respond. Those from Amherst, Massachusetts, responded by 

 the bursting of the buds on February 7; on February 8 the first leaf 

 had unfolded; on February 15 all the leaves had unfolded, while on

Conclusions Based on Experiments. 



The experiments of the second year corroborate those of the first 

 year in many particulars. First, it will be noticed that in every case 

 where the twigs responded, they followed the sequence already estab- 

 lished among the branches from the same locality. In the first experi- 

 ments, the phenologic sequence was established by contrasting the 

 development of plants out of doors with those treated experimentally 

 in the greenhouse, and it was found, as before emphasized, that the bud 

 development in chemical solutions followed the same order as out of 

 doors. The experiments of the second year go to prove the same thing. 

 However, we know that in general pear trees blossom earlier than 

 apple trees; that Forsythia flowers earlier than the horse chestnut; 

 that the male catkins of the Carolina poplar appear earlier than the 

 flowers of the linden and the oak throughout the Eastern United States 

 at large. 



By correspondence with the stations from which the twigs were 

 obtained the following phenologic data was secured that shows the 

 sequence of bud development: 4

This general sequential development is preserved in the experimental 

 liquids. The same phenomenon with reference to the action of poisons 

 was emphasized in the experiments of the second year. As the data 

 will show, buds were eased and many burst by the stimulating action 

 of the various chemicals. In some instances the leaves unfolded, 

 flower buds opened and such leaves and flowers reached their normal 

 size. This was notably the case with flowers of Forsythia viridis- 

 sima (Pennsylvania State College) in strong corrosive sublimate solu- 

 tion, with the leaves of the Seckel pear (College Park, Maryland) 

 in the same solution, with the leaves and flowers of the Kieffer pear 

 (from Michigan) in the weak corrosive sublimate, with the leaves of 

 Populus monilifera (Auburn, Alabama) in weak copper sulphate 

 solution, with the Bartlett pear flowers (Amherst, Massachusetts) 

 in weak copper sulphate, with the York Imperial apple (Amherst, 

 Massachusetts) in weak sodium chloride, with the horse chestnut 

 ( Pennsylvania State College) leaves in strong sodium chloride, with the 

 York Imperial apple (Amherst, Massachusetts) leaves in weak sodium 

 chloride, with the red maple (Lansing, Michigan) flowers in weak 

 sodium chloride, with the Forsythia (Lexington, Kentucky) flowers 

 in strong ammonium nitrate, with the Populus monilifera (Auburn, 

 Alabama) leaves in the same solution. In the weak ammonium 

 nitrate solution, the leaves of the Forsythia twigs from Pennsylvania 

 State College reached full size, as did those of Populus monilifera from 

 Philadelphia in strong potassium chloride and the flowers of the Bart- 

 lett pear (Lansing, Michigan) in weak potassium chloride. The flowers 

 of Clapp Favorite and Kieff er pears opened when the twigs were placed 

 in weak potassium bisulphate, as also the leaves of the Kieffer pear 

 twigs from Lafayette, Indiana. In weak acetic acid solution, the 

 leaves of the Red Astrachan apple (Auburn, Alabama) opened fully 

 wide. The flowers of the Maiden Blush (College Park, Maryland) 

 opened when the twigs were placed in the weak chromic acid solution. 

 But eventually, with but few exceptions, all of the twigs succumbed, 

 many after the first green leaf had been formed. The strong solutions 

 of copper sulphate, potassium bisulphate, hydrochloric and nitric acids 

 seemed to be arrestive and deadly, because very few of the twigs 

 even responded when placed in these solutions. 

 These results, it seems to the writer, are corroborative of the principle

101 



that response is not arrested until the poison has actually penetrated 

 and killed the living cells, thus putting a stop to the suctional activity 

 and responsive power of the living cells. The poisons enumerated, 

 being perhaps more easily conducted, act at once in killing the cells, 

 which with other poisons are stimulated long before they are eventually 

 killed. Bose (loc. cit, 383) has demonstrated this differential activity 

 of poisonous solutions in a number of his experiments. Among various 

 solutions of salt, some are physiologically neutral in their effects; of 

 these potassium nitrate may be taken as an example. Others, again, 

 like a strong solution of sodium chloride, act as excitatory agents. 

 The application of this last reagent is known to initiate rhythmic 

 excitation in animal tissues. Similar effects have been shown to be 

 brought about by this reagent in the case of Biophytum and Desmo- 

 dium. Thus in a strong solution of potassium nitrate we have a 

 reagent whose physiologic action is more or less neutral, while its 

 osmotic action is pronounced, and in a strong solution of common salt 

 we have an agent which is both excitatory and osmotic at the same 

 time. If, then, we apply K NO 3 solution to the base of a cut stem, 

 placed in the shoshungraph (Bose's apparatus), water will be osmotic- 

 ally withdrawn from the plant in opposition to normal suction, and 

 the normal suctional rate will be somewhat reduced. On the appli- 

 cation of copper sulphate, the suctional movement, Bose found, was 

 quickly arrested, and this was followed almost immediately by a slight 

 movement in the negative direction ; showing that by some spasmodic 

 contraction water was expelled from the tissue. This phase was 

 succeeded by an almost complete arrest of suction, there being now 

 only the feeblest ascensional movement. Within a short period after 

 this, on washing off the poisonous reagent, it was found that the arrest 

 had been temporary only, suction being renewed at the rate of eleven 

 instead of the normal fifteen cubic mm. per minute. The poison was 

 applied once more and allowed to act for thirty-six hours. The arrest 

 was then found to be permanent — that is to say, the substitution of 

 fresh water induced no revival of response, the plant being killed 

 throughout. It is interesting to note that the twigs experimented 

 with at the University of Pennsylvania responded after a much longer 

 time interval than thirty-six hours, as noted in the experimental data 

 above. 



It will be noted also that the sequence between northern and south- 

 ern grown twigs was preserved in the experimental liquids. If the 

 results obtained in the chemical solutions are contrasted with those 

 in the water, it will be found that the buds on branches obtained from

northern localities responded much more quickly than did those from 

 southern localities. Thus in water the leaf buds of the Red Astrachan 

 apple from Storrs, Connecticut, burst on February 4; those from 

 Lansing, Michigan, on February 6, and those from Auburn, Alabama, 

 on February 11 — a difference of a week between the more northern 

 and the more southern localities. The leaf buds of the York Imperial 

 apple burst in water on January 31 from Geneva, New York; 5 February 

 3 from Amherst, Massachusetts; February 4 from Storrs, Connecticut; 

 February 11 from College Park, Maryland, and February 15 from 

 Auburn, Alabama. A reference to the experimental data will show 

 practically the same sequence throughout, the buds on northern grown 

 twigs always opening before those on southern grown ones. The 

 sequence of the bud development in the chemical solutions proceeded 

 as above indicated for the twigs in water. The buds on twigs of the 

 same species, where comparison is possible, from northern localities 

 opened first in the same chemical and those of southern localities 

 followed as indicated below;

In this case the buds developed coincidently from widely separated

 more plastic species that it is more thoroughly so. Yet in the next 

 experiment there is a difference.

The fact that there is such a difference between the time when the 

 leaf and flower buds of the same variety and species of fruit and forest 

 trees open is an index of the extent of their acclimatization. The 

 native trees have, since their migration from the original forest centre, 

 been acclimated to their new localities of growth, while the introduced 

 fruit trees since their introduction to America have become similarly 

 ameliorated to the American climate, so that they react in nature and 

 in the experimental culture solutions exactly as do the native plants. 



Bearing of Experimental Data on the Advent of Spring. 



The climatic differences between the north and the south, representing 

 the amount of acclimatization which each species has had to adopt, 

 may be demonstrated by a study of the advent of spring. The tem- 

 perature of 42.8° F. (6° C.) is that at which the protoplasmic contents 

 of the ordinary plant find the limits of their activity. The advent of 

 spring may be considered as taking place at the approach of an isotherm 

 one degree higher, or 43.8° F. This isotherm, progressing steadily in

its advance across the United States, is illustrated in the accompany- 

 ing map which was constructed from the recorded mean temperatures 

 for 15 years from 1870-1885. 7 This line may be regarded as the edge 

 of spring. In the Gulf States there is no true advent of spring. On 

 February 1 the isotherm in question crosses the United States from 

 the vicinity of Cape Hatteras on the east to the north of El Paso, then 

 turns northwestward and reaches the Pacific coast some distance north 

 of San Francisco. The advance on the first of successive months is 

 illustrated by the map. 



Spring may be said to begin in our most northern locality, Lansing, 

 Michigan, about May 1. Auburn, Alabama, lies below the isotherm of 

 February 1. We therefore have a difference of three months in the 

 awakenment of vegetation under the influence of the advent of spring 

 conditions. Yet in our experimental cultures no such great discrep- 

 ancy existed, because the heat of the greenhouse is more uniform 

 (not so fluctuating), and yet, notwithstanding the fact that the interval 

 between the ■ successive events is shortened, nevertheless the same 

 phenologic sequence is maintained as described above. The difference 

 of three months in the advent of spring between the most northern 

 and the most southern of our localities indicates the real amount of 

 acclimatization of the same species and race growing in the different 

 places from which the experimental material was obtained. That is, 

 the growing season of trees and shrubs is very much abbreviated com- 

 pared with the growing season in more southern situations. Three 

 months difference is a very appreciable amount between the northern 

 and southern States, and the fact that such fruit trees as the Maiden 

 Blush apple and the Kicffer pear can be grown in Michigan and Ala- 

 bama is noteworthy as an instance of acclimatization of the most pro- 

 nounced type. In Alabama the growing season is about nine months 

 long, from February 1 to November 1. In Michigan the growing season 

 begins May 1 and is completed by the beginning of October, a length 

 of about five and a half months. The fact that many of the fruit 

 trees mentioned above did not take kindly to the American climate, 

 and that they afterwards became adapted to its wide range of climatic 

 conditions is proof of their acclimatization. Yet some doubt that 

 acclimatization occurs. A writer in Forest Leaves (XI : 108) says 

 that "Trees are fixed, almost inflexible, in their habits. For centuries, 

 indeed as long as we have record, each species has kept in its beaten 

 ways, insisting on the same average of temperature and refusing to

grow where this could not be, seeking and occupying certain kinds of 

 soil and demanding certain amounts of moisture and avoiding situa- 

 tions where these were wanting. " In connection with the experiments 

 which have preceded, some experimental data from other sources should 

 be given in order to prove that organisms can be acclimated, that is 

 can be inured or habituated to conditions at first injurious to them. 

 A reference to the short bibliography of acclimatization at the end of 

 this paper will enable the investigator to obtain the additional evidence 

 of acclimatization which it is not possible to review. The experimental 

 data for animals and plants is here given. 



General Experimental Work on Acclimatization. 



Among invertebrates Loew 8 has found in Owen's Lake, California, 

 the alkaline waters of which contain among other things 2.5% of Na 2 C0 3 , 

 numerous living infusoria, Copepoda, larva? of Ephydra and molds. 

 Again the vinegar eel, Rhabditis aceti, lives in a 4% solution of acetic 

 acid, although this strength is usually fatal: e. g., a 0.23% solution of 

 acetic acid kills the tentacles of Drosera, according to Darwin. Beu- 

 dant accustomed fresh-water animals to salt water. He used Lymnea, 

 Physa, Planorbis, Ancyclus, Paludina and some other fresh-water 

 mollusks. He began in April by putting these organisms into a 1% 

 NaCl solution, and, continuing to add salt slowly, by September many 

 of these withstood a 4% solution, a solution which kills animals sud- 

 denly subjected to it. He performed the reverse experiment upon 

 marine mollusca, bringing them to live in fresh water by gradually 

 diluting the medium. According to MacDougal, 9 Lopriori found that 

 while the streaming movements of protoplasm were inhibited by 

 exposure to an atmosphere of one part oxygen and four parts carbon 

 dioxide, yet if the plant were first exposed to a mixture of 25 parts 

 of oxygen and 75 of carbon dioxide for a time, it might then be brought 

 successively into atmospheres containing 80, 85, 90, 95 and even 100 

 parts of the gas without immediate injury. Organisms can be accli- 

 matized to extreme temperatures. Davenport (loc.cit., 249) cites illus- 

 trations of both. Few active organisms can withstand a temperature 

 of over 45° C, and for whole groups like Ccelenterata, marine mollusca, 

 Crustacea and fishes 40° is a point of death. There are plant and ani- 

 mal organisms that cany on their life processes in hot springs. Simple 

 plants like Chroococcus, Nostoc, Anabcena, Leptothrix, Oscillaria, etc.,

exist in springs where the temperature ranges from 45° to 93° C. Roti- 

 fers and Anguillulidse were found in the Carlsbad Springs of Bohemia 

 at a temperature of 44° to 54° ; Cypris balnearia occurred in water 45° 

 to 50.5° and Stratiomys larva at 69° in a hot spring in Colorado. But 

 the experiments of Dallinger are remarkable illustrations of gradual 

 acclimatization. He kept Flagellata in a warm oven for many months. 

 Beginning with a temperature of 15.6° C. he employed the first four 

 months in raising the temperature 5.5°; this, however, was not neces- 

 sary, since the rise to 21° can be made rapidly, but for success in higher 

 temperatures he found it best to proceed slowly from the beginning. 

 When the temperatures had been raised to 23° the organisms began 

 drying, but soon ceased, and after two months the temperature was 

 raised half a degree more and eventually to 25.5°. Here the organisms 

 began to succumb again, but finally after several years of treatment 

 Dallinger succeeded in rearing the organisms in a temperature of 70° C. 

 The same acclimatization to cold may be shown. Thus the swarm 

 spores of a marine alga were liberated when the temperature of the 

 water was between 1.5° and 1.8° C. 



We can exemplify this kind of acclimatization in the higher plants. 

 Our treatment of the twigs from various localities demonstrates that 

 this kind of acclimatization was operative in the past with each tree 

 species. Sweet peas raised in Calcutta from seed imported from Eng- 

 land rarely blossom and never yield seed; plants from French seed 

 flower better, but are still sterile; but those raised from Darjeeling 

 seed (originally imported from England) both flower and seed profusely, 

 according to Wallace. 10 Speaking of the introduction of the Sea Island 

 cotton into the United States, Wight 11 says that (Gossypium barbadense 

 and G. vitifolium) they were with much difficulty introduced into 

 North America owing to the shortness of the summer season. The 

 former (Sea Island), indeed, could not be established until a fortunate 

 occurrence of a very mild winter permitted the roots to live through it 

 and produce an early crop of fresh shoots in the spring. These bore 

 and ripened, the seed of which was found sufficiently hardy to resist 

 the cold of spring and matured a crop of excellent cotton in the course 

 of the succeeding autumn. Indian corn develops local varieties with 

 extreme readiness, but they seldom succeed when transferred even short 

 distances, at least until time enough for acclimatization has elapsed. 

 E. Davenport sent a standard white Illinois corn, ripening in about

120 days and capable of maximum yields (75 bushels per acre), 

 to be grown in Michigan, Wisconsin, Maine and Mississippi. In 

 Maine it failed to ripen, but at all other points it ripened in about 

 100 days, producing small, inferior ears. That it should hurry 

 through its period of growth at the north was not surprising, but that 

 it should do so in the south is unaccountable. 12 The season of maize 

 varies from six months in the elevated plains of Santa Fe in South 

 America to four months in the middle United States and two and one- 

 half months in the rainy lake district northwest of Lake Superior. 13 

 Peach trees from central Georgia blossom ten to twelve days later in 

 Virginia and Maryland than do those of the same variety from New 

 Jersey or New York. As peach trees are propagated by buds we may 

 regard the Georgia and New Jersey trees, being of the same variety, as 

 parts of the same individual. The foregoing citations indicate that 

 acclimatization does occur, and that in the case of the experimental 

 twigs the differences in the time of the bud development illustrates 

 that acclimatization has taken place to the extent of a variation in 

 habit as to their seasonal development, emphasized in the acclimatiza- 

 tion of the cotton, corn and peach previously described. 



The response of the buds in the chemical solutions was an immediate 

 one, and at a season of the year when all of the twigs from widely sepa- 

 rated stations (north and south) were in a dormant condition. The 

 advantage of these experiments in demonstrating the above conclusions 

 is marked over the growth of such trees in the forest, or in the orchard, 

 for the reason that as to temperature all of the twigs were exposed 

 equally to the same amount, and those placed in the pure water were 

 under practically the same conditions, while the chemical solutions 

 provided enough of different conditions under experimental control 

 which would produce alterations in the time and method of response, 

 if such could be produced by experimental means. The results have 

 already been summarized.

AN ORTHOPTEROLOGICAL RECONNOISSANCE OF THE SOUTHWESTERN 

 UNITED STATES. PART II: NEW MEXICO AND WESTERN TEXAS. 



BY JAMES A. G. REHN and MORGAN HEBARD. 



The first portion of the results of this examination of the south- 

 western United States, treating of Arizona material, has already been 

 published in these Proceedings. 1 



Seven rather distinct regions were examined in the area covered by 

 this paper, notes on the localities being given below. In addition a 

 number of other localities are represented in the series by lots of from 

 one to six species. A small lot of material from Fort Wingate, McKin- 

 ley County, New Mexico, collected by Mr. John Woodgate and now the 

 property of the Academy, has also been examined in this connection. 



Mr. Otho Poling, of Quincy, Illinois, assisted in collecting some of 

 the material secured at Deming, while all taken at Albuquerque and 

 Aden was collected by the junior author. 



The number of species examined and treated in this report is one 

 hundred and fifteen, of which six prove to be new, while the specimens 

 number one thousand, three hundred and ninety-five. 



The types of all the new forms are in the Hebard Collection. 



El Paso and Franklin Mountains, El Paso County, Texas. Alti- 

 tudes, 3,700 to about 5,600 feet. July 9 to 11 and 17, 1907. 



The vicinity of El Paso may be divided into several regions: first, 

 the low bottom-land along the river, this section being threaded with 

 acequias and a considerable portion is or has been under cultivation; 

 second, a region of low sand dunes slightly northeast of the city, 

 covered with a scattering growth of mesquite ; third, a fairly extensive 

 mesa bordering the Franklin Mountains, very broken and rugged on 

 its eroded marginal slopes where is exposed a sort of caliche as the basis 

 of the mesa, and quite level on the summit, all covered more or less 

 completely with rather uniformly-sized greasewood {Covillea tridentata) 

 bushes, mingled on the rugged base slopes with mesquite (Prosopis 

 velutina) and occasionally tornillo or screw bean (Prosopis odorata) ; 

 fourth, the Franklin Mountains, rising from the mesa to an elevation

of from 5,000 to 7,000 feet. The latter were ascended to the summit 

 of the South Peak, altitude about 5,600 feet, and found to be 

 desert to that height. The slopes of this range are covered more or 

 less uniformly on the lower section with greasewood, while the higher 

 portions are sparsely covered with aloes and other desert species. They 

 were very productive of Orthoptera, Syrbula fuscovittata, Bootettix 

 argentatus, Diapheromera covillece, Pseudosermyle tenuis, Mermiria 

 iexana, Arphia teporata and others being taken. 



On the mesa and at the foot of the same the greasewood yielded, 

 among others, Diapheromera covilleo3, Bootettix argentatus, Melanoplus 

 bowditchi, M. herbaceus, Ateloplus macroscelus and Litaneidria skinneri, 

 while Anconia coeruleipennis , Heliastus aridus, Schistocerca vaga, 

 Trimerotropis texana, Psoloessa texana, Derotmema laticinctum and 

 Phrynotettix robustus were found on and about the mesa. In the sand- 

 hill region the character of the Orthoptera was found to be much like 

 that of the mesa, but in the clumps of mesquite Melanoplus glaucipes, 

 M. herbaceus, Moloplus elegans, and Schistocerca shoshone were found. 



The low bottom-land is covered in many places with tangles of screw 

 bean (Prosopis odorata), with tall rank weeds in others, and areas 

 of hardened bare adobe are also to be found. In the tornillo tangles 

 Melanoplus glaucipes, Moloplus elegans, Mermiria bivittata and Dia- 

 pheromera mesillana were found, while the areas of high weeds har- 

 bored JEoloplus elegans, Melanoplus herbaceus, M. aridus, M. atlanis, 

 Stagmomantis sp., and Diapheromera persimilis. On the bare spots 

 Paropomala virgata, Derotmema laticinctum, Trimerotropis rubripes 

 and Hippiscus corallipes were found. 



Alamogordo and Dry Canyon, Sacramento Mountains, Otero County, 

 New Mexico. Altitude, 4,300 to 5,500 feet. July 12 and 13, 1907. . 



The conditions in the vicinity of Alamogordo have already been 

 treated by Stone and Rehn 2 and Ruthven. 3 Our collecting was re- 

 stricted to the edge of the mesquite area, on the eastern margin of 

 which the town is situated, and the greasewood slopes leading to Dry 

 Canyon. The mesquite section was unproductive, while in the grease- 

 wood belt Bootettix argentatus, Ectatoderus borealis, Gryllus alogus and 

 Psoloessa texana were secured, but most of them not in such numbers as 

 at El Paso. In the broken country at the first foothills and in the 

 arroyos at the canyon mouth collecting was more productive, Para- 

 bacillus coloradus, Dichopetala brevihastata and Yersinia solitaria

being taken and a greater variety of species noticed. Work was 

 continued up the south arm of Dry Canyon to the broader valley- 

 like portion of the canyon above the spring. Here pinon (Pinus 

 edulis or cembroides) and juniper (Juniperus pachyphlcea) appeared, 

 giving the canyon bottom a park-like appearance quite different from 

 the sotol (Dasylirion) and ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens) covered 

 slopes at the canyon's mouth. In this region, which is at about 5,500 

 feet elevation, one Amblycorypha huasteca was beaten from a small 

 green tree, while on the barer slopes at the same elevation several 

 interesting species, such as Yersinia solitaria, Syrbula fuscovittata, 

 Amphitornus ornatus and Melanoplus aridus, were taken. 



At night in Alamogordo several species of Orthoptera, such as 

 Derotmema laticinctum, Trimerotropis texana and Gryllus, came to the 

 street lamps, while Coleoptera and Lepidoptera were attracted in the 

 greatest numbers. Certain species of beetles, as Cicindela lemniscata 

 and Tetracha Carolina, fairly swarmed, and the great moth Marumba 

 occidentalis was by no means uncommon. 



Cloudcroft, Sacramento Mountains, Otero County, New Mexico. 

 Altitude. 8,600 to 8,700 feet. July 14 to 16, 1907. 



This charming spot, situated on the summit of the Sacramento range, 

 does not appear to be on the mountain top except at certain points 

 of lookout, where one looks down on the long slopes and deep canyons 

 of the mountains w T hich sink into the desert plain of the Otero basin 

 or Hueco bolson as it is variously called. The Cloudcroft region is one 

 of low hills with beautiful open vales between them. The hills and 

 some of the level areas are covered with magnificent forests, chiefly 

 of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga mucronata), western yellow pine {Pinus 

 ponderosa) and in some places aspen (Populus tremuloides) . The vales, 

 or "canyons" as they are termed by courtesy, are usually carpeted 

 with numerous grasses and in many places are veritable flower beds. 

 Many of the forest trees are of immense size, and the rich greens of the 

 region are in striking contrast to the colors of the desert but ten miles 

 away, though some thousands of feet below. In a grassy field, bounded 

 on one side by a stand of deciduous saplings and on the other by huge 

 firs, we found Gomphocerus clavatus, Melanoplus calidus and M . atlanis 

 plentiful. One specimen of Eritettix variabilis was also taken in this 

 location. Among the firs on the border of this field a single Chloealtis 

 abdominalis was heard striclulating among some low herbage near a 

 stump and was captured. The very noisy Circotettix undulatus was 

 plentiful in open spots in the forest, along the roads and on bare 

 lumbered slopes. One Melanoplus altitudinum was found in damp 




114 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



grasses at the junction of two of the glades, and another specimen was 

 taken on a steep hillside in open conifer forest. In the latter situa- 

 tion Acrydium crassum was also taken. Search in many pine and fir 

 logs disclosed only a few Ceuthophilus, valgus and uniformis being taken. 



The nights were very chilly and no katydids were heard. The 

 effect of the cool evenings was apparent in the scarcity of Melanoplus 

 calidus and Gomphocerus clavatus before ten in the mornings, both 

 species occurring in numbers in the afternoon. 



Aden, Donna Ana County, New Mexico. Altitude, 4,382 to 5,000 

 feet. July 21, 1907. 



The plain about this station differs from the greater part of the 

 southern New Mexican desert plains in that it is covered in most 

 places by low grasses, giving it some slight resemblance to the Great 

 Plains. Over this plain small mesquite bushes are scattered at greater 

 distances than usual. Near the railroad track the grasses grow in 

 great profusion, reaching in many places a height of nearly a foot. 

 In this location Orthoptera were found in very great numbers, among 

 the series taken being several plains species not found on the surround- 

 ing deserts. 



About a quarter of a mile from the station a rounded hill rises directly 

 from the prairie. This hill is very rocky and covered by a scattered 

 growth of grease wood (Covillea tridentata), and in spite of its elevation 

 of not more than 600 feet above the surrounding plain several 

 mountain-loving species, such as Eritettix variabilis and Arphia teporata, 

 were found on it. It is interesting to note that such forms of Orthop- 

 tera were to be found on this solitary little knob, in spite of its small 

 size, low altitude and the fact that it is several miles distant from 

 the nearest hills. 



Deming, Luna County, New Mexico. Altitude about 4,350 feet. 

 July 18-21, 1907. 



About the town of Deming stretches a typical desert plain, covered 

 with groves of medium-sized mesquite (Prosopis velutina) and large 

 areas of rabbit-weed (Isocoma heterophylla) , broken on the north by 

 the bed of the Mimbres River. On both sides of this stream-bed are 

 extensive flats of white sand closely dotted with tall yuccas. These 

 flats average about half a mile to a mile in width and are hard to 

 cross, owing to the loose and yielding sand. No low vegetation is 

 present on these areas, and but two species of Orthoptera, Tri- 

 merotropis texana and laticincta, were taken in the section. On the 

 north side of the sand and yucca belt, in extensive rabbit-weed tracts, 

 collecting was very productive, Hesperotettix viridis being found in 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 115 



abundance and Pseudosermyle straminea and truncata were taken, the 

 former in numbers, the latter sparingly. As Deming is a considerable 

 distance from the greasewood slopes at the bases of the nearest moun- 

 tains (Florida and Cook's ranges), those areas were too distant to be 

 examined on foot. 



The interesting roach Homceogamia eiratica was found at night 

 about lights in the town, while Hormilia eleyans was attracted the same 

 way. 



Florida Mountains, Luna County, New Mexico. Altitude, 4,500 to 

 5,500 feet, July 19, 1907. 



By driving fourteen miles across the mesquite plain from Deming 

 and ascending the gradual greasewood slopes the Florida Mountains 

 were reached. Various stops on the way revealed nothing of special 

 interest in either the mesquite or greasewood areas. A canyon at the 

 north end of the range, extending southwest under the towering bulk 

 of Capitol Dome, was our objective point. A small spring which trick- 

 led a short distance over the rocks before disappearing proved very 

 attractive to Telmatettix aztecus, which was present in numbers on 

 the damp spots. The slopes of the canyon were rugged and steep, but 

 we ascended the east face to about 5,500 feet elevation. On the semi- 

 barren slope, with here and there a holly-like scrub oak and numerous 

 scattered mountain bushes, the former often with a precarious hold be- 

 tween boulders, Orthoptera were not uncommon and in character were 

 very interesting. Among the species found were Yersinia solitaria, Mer- 

 miria texana, Melanoplus aridus, Mestobregma plattei and Trimero- 

 tropis cyaneipennis. The steepness of the ascent and the short length 

 of time at our disposal prevented us from reaching the summit of the 

 mountains. The slopes at the foot of the mountains did not yield 

 even moderately good collecting and but two or three common species 

 were taken. 



Silver City, Grant County, New Mexico. Altitude, 5,900 feet. 

 July 20, 1907. 



About one-half day was spent at Silver City, collecting on the rounded 

 hills west of the town. Various short grasses scantily covered the 

 tops and slopes of these hills, with here and there in the ravines and 

 valleys clumps of juniper. Collecting was not very productive, the 

 only species worthy of note being Aulocara rufum (the first New Mexi- 

 can record), Cordillacris apache, Stirapleura pusilla and Trimerotropis 

 melanoptera. 



Albuquerque, Bernalillo County, New Mexico. Altitude about 

 4,900 feet. September 14, 1907. 




116 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



Nearly all the collecting at Albuquerque was accomplished near 

 the river in low grassy fields and areas of cultivated ground. In 

 this location Orthoptera were found in great numbers, but collecting 

 was made difficult by the swarms of mosquitoes which were every- 

 where very active and vicious. On areas of short grass were found 

 Encoptolophus texensis, Litaneutria skinneri, Paropomala calamus and 

 virgata and Mermiria bivittata, while in the higher and more succulent 

 growths of heavy weeds, clover and grasses many Melanoplus bivit- 

 tatus, M. femur-rubrum, M. differentialis and Nemobius utahensis were 

 found. A single specimen of Telmatettix aztecus was captured by a 

 pool beside the river and one other specimen was seen. In the arid 

 foothill section but two specimens of Trimerotropis fascicula and one 

 or two T. vinculata were found.

TEMNOPTERYX Brunner. 

 Temnopteryx desertae n. sp. 



Type: 9 ; Johnstone, Valverde Co., Texas. July 8, 1907. M. 

 Hebard. [Hebard Collection.] 



A very peculiar species with lateral, non-attingent tegmina. Its 

 relationship is closer to T. limbata Saussure from eastern Mexico and 

 T. lobipennis Saussure from Brazil than to any other species of the 

 genus, differing from the former in the more elongate and non-attin- 

 gent tegmina, which reach to the apical margin of the first abdominal 

 segment, and in the shorter and thicker cerci; from the latter in the 

 proportionately shorter tegmina and much smaller general size. 



In general appearance the resemblance of the species to those of the 

 genus Loboptera is very great, but the wings are present as distinct, 

 articulate though functionless appendages, which is not the case with 

 Loboptera. 



Size small; form depressed, ovate. Head with the occipital outline 

 arcuate and distinctly projecting beyond the pronotum; space between 

 the eyes great, slightly more than that between the ocellar spots. 

 Pronotum slightly broader than longer, moderately arcuate transversely, 

 lateral and cephalic margins slightly thickened, cephalic margin 

 arcuato-truncate, lateral margins moderately arcuate, caudo-lateral

angles rounded rectangnlate, caudal margin very slightly arcuate; 



caudal portion of the disk with a pair of shallowly impressed 



areas. Tegmina about equal to the pronotum in length, elongate 



trigonal, reaching to the margin of the first abdominal segment, 



the greatest width contained one and one-half times in the 



length; costal margin straight, arcuate at the base and at the apex,

HOM(EOGAMIA Burmeister. 

 Homoeogamia erratica Rehn. 



At Deming, July 18 to 20 , a series of eleven males of this species was 

 collected at night about electric lights in the town. All the specimens 

 were taken on rough walls or screens upon which a light shone, excepting 

 one specimen which was flying about a light, much in the manner 

 of a Noctuid, but not so erratic. There is in the lot an appreciable 

 amount of variation in size, and in a few specimens the disk of the 

 pronotum is darker than in others. In all of the eleven individuals 

 the interspace between the ocelli is greater than that between the 

 eyes, although in one specimen the difference is very slight. 



This is the first exact record of the species from New Mexico. 



MANTID^E. 

 YERSINIA Saussure. 

 Yersinia solitaria Scudder. 



On rocky slopes and ledges and on scattered boulders at altitudes 

 of from 4,300 to 6,000 feet this species appears at home. Perfectly 

 protected by its coloration which harmonizes with its environment, it 

 is with considerable difficulty that individuals are located. When 

 disturbed they spring very quickly to a new resting-place, often jump- 

 ing as much as six inches, frequently repeating their spring several 

 times until a place of safety is reached. 



A series of twenty-six specimens was taken at the following localities : 

 Dry Canyon, Sacramento Mountains, 4,900-5,500 feet, July 13, two 

 males and two females; Aden, 4,386 feet, July 21, one male; Florida 

 Mountains, 5,100-5,200 feet, July 19, eight males, five females; Silver 

 City, 5,900 feet, July 20, four males, one female and two with the 

 sex not determinable as the apex of the abdomen is missing in both. 

 The majority of the individuals collected are immature, but several 

 from Dry Canyon, a number from the Florida Mountains and one from 

 Silver City are fully adult. Adult males from the Florida Mountains 

 range from 19 to 22 mm. in length of body, while mature females from 

 the same locality show extremes of 18 and 25 mm. In color numerous 

 shades are present — clay color, ochraceous, orange-red, wood brown, 

 seal brown and greenish-yellow, one specimen being parti-color, the 

 head, pro- and mesothorax and limbs pale orange-red, the remainder 

 of the body very pale ochraceous. 



Two males and two females from Fort Wingate, New Mexico, taken 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 119 



September 15-16, 1908, by John Woodgate, have also been ex- 

 amined. 



The records given herewith are the first published ones of the species 

 from southern New Mexico, while the known range extends from western 

 Nebraska and southwestern Colorado south to central southern New 

 Mexico and southeastern Arizona. 



LITANETITRIA Saussure. 

 Litaneutria skinneri Rehn. 



At El Paso this interesting species was taken in three quite different 

 situations : swept from dry grass in sandy ground along the Rio Grande, 

 July 10 (one cJ* ) ; swept from greasewood on edge of mesa, 4,200 feet, 

 July 11 (one 9 ), and taken from the bare face of a precipitous rock at 

 5,000 feet elevation in the Franklin Mountains, July 9 (one 9 ). One 

 male and two females were taken on dry bunch grass at Albuquerque 

 on September 14, while five immature specimens (two d\ three 9) 

 taken at Aden, July 21, on grass prairie, and at Silver City, July 20, are 

 provisionally referred to this species. The Albuquerque females and 

 the Franklin Mountains individual are equal to the female type in size, 

 while the other El Paso female is distinctly smaller and less robust. 

 The Franklin Mountains specimen is blotched and barred with seal- 

 brown on a pale mars-brown ground, a coloration eminently protec- 

 tive as our field notes mention the blending of this insect's coloring into 

 the surroundings. 



The range of this species now extends from the Grand Canyon region, 

 Arizona, and Albuquerque, New Mexico, south to the Huachuca 

 Mountains, Arizona, and the vicinity of El Paso, Texas. 



STAGMOMANTIS Saussure. 

 Stagmomantis sp. 



Immature specimens of a species of this genus were taken as follows : 

 on irrigated land at El Paso, July 10 and 11; at the east base of the 

 Franklin Mountains, July 9; Alamogordo, July" 13; Aden, July 21, on 

 rabbit weed; Deming, July 18; Silver City, July 20. Of the eleven 

 specimens before us all are in the green phase except one which has 

 the thorax dark brown. The Alamogordo specimen is a female nearly 

 mature. 



PHASMID^B. 



PARABACILLUS Caudell. 

 Parabacillus coloradus (Scudder). 



This peculiar walking stick was encountered at three localities, viz. : 

 Dry Canyon, 5,000 feet elevation, July 13, two females; Cloudcroft. 




120 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



8,600 feet elevation, July 15, one male; Aden, 4,400-4,500 feet ele- 

 vation, July 21, five females. The Cloudcroft male is apparently 

 mature, the remainder being in about the same stage of the immature 

 condition. 



At Aden and in Dry Canyon the species was taken by beating low 

 vegetation, while at Cloudcroft it was captured in a clump of grass 

 under pines and fir. Two females, taken at Fort Wingate, New Mexico, 

 Nov. 4, 1907, and Sept. 9, 1908, by John Woodgate, have also been 

 examined. The range of this form now extends from Nebraska and 

 Colorado south to southern New Mexico and west to southern Cali- 

 fornia. 



PSEUDOSERMYLE Caudell. 

 Pseudosermyle straminea (Scudder). 



This species was present, July 18, in great numbers on rabbit weed 

 on the plain north of the town of Deming and around the dry bed of 

 the Mimbres River. A series of twenty-one males, all adult, and four 

 females in various stages of immaturity was taken on that date. A 

 single male was taken from the same plant on the lower slopes of the 

 Florida Mountains, July 19, while six of the same sex from Aden, July 

 21, and one other male from Dry Canyon, Sacramento Mountains, taken 

 on July 13, are included in the collection. Practically all of the specimens 

 were taken by beating, the insects exhibiting a striking reliance upon 

 their protective form and coloration. When alarmed they held them- 

 selves motionless with legs at stiff angles and, upon experimenting 

 with one of the individuals, this was found to be true when it was picked 

 from the bush, and even when dropped upon the sand it retained its 

 rigidity. 



In size there is a considerable amount of variation, the extremes of 

 the Deming series of males measuring 40.5 and 47 millimeters in the 

 length of the body. The form of the male cerci remains essentially 

 the same, some slight but unimportant variations being present. In 

 coloration there appears to be two types, in the male at least, one olive- 

 greenish, the other greenish-yellow, the whitish lateral lines being- 

 present more or less distinctly in all the adult males seen. The imma- 

 ture females are all yellowish-green, with very faint indications, in one 

 or two individuals, of the lateral lines. 



This species was previously known only from the vicinity of Mesilla 

 Park, Donna Ana County, New Mexico. The range now covers 

 sections of Otero, Donna Ana and Luna Counties. 



Pseudosermyle truncata Caudell. 



Associated with P. straminea on rabbit weed, three males and one

female of this species were taken near Deming, July 18, while under 

 similar surroundings at Aden a pair were taken on July 21. 



The males are of very similar coloration, the olive green predomi- 

 nating in one or two more than in the others. The females, however, 

 are quite dissimilar, one being pale yellowish-green, the other pale 

 cupreous green like weathered copper. 



The range of this species is now known to extend from Aden, Donna 

 Ana County, New Mexico, to Los Angeles County, California, and 

 from the Grand Canyon region to near the Mexican line.

Type: cT ; Franklin Mountains, altitude 4,500 

 feet, near El Paso, El Paso County, Texas. 

 July 9, 1907. Hebard and Rehn. [Hebard 

 Collection.] 



This new form is a most interesting species, 

 allied to P. banksii Caudell, from eastern and 

 east-central Texas. Through the kindness 

 of the describer of banksii I have been able to 

 compare the new form with a typical specimen 

 of his species, from which tenuis differs in the 

 slightly more robust build with slightly shorter 

 legs though the body is slightly longer, in the 

 absence of a median carina from the caudal 

 portion of the occiput, in the smoother proxi- 

 mal antennal joint, in the narrower pronotum 

 which is distinctly constricted cephalad, in 

 the less distinctly keeled meso- and meta- 

 notum, in the less compressed and more in- 

 flated apex of the abdomen, and in the slightly 

 more incurved cerci. 



Size medium; form very elongate, extremely 

 slender. Head slightly longer than the prono- 

 tum, decidedly longer than broad, slightly 

 narrower at the caudal margin than immediately 

 caudad of the eyes, a pair of short low sinuate 

 carinse present mesad and extending caudad 

 as far as between the caudal margin of the eyes, 

 these carinse sharply constricted between the 

 antennae and again slightly constricted at a 

 point between the cephalic margin of the eyes, 

 a slight median carina present between the paired caringe caudad;

occiput smooth; eyes slightly depressed, circular in outline, rather 

 small, not prominent; antennse slightly exceeding the head and 

 thoracic segments in length, slender, the joints elongate, the 

 proximal joint with a slight lamellate expansion on the proximo- 

 internal portion. Pronotum narrow, the greatest width (supra-coxal) 

 contained about one and one-half times in the length, the cephalic 

 portion strongly constricted with the lateral margins bent ventrad 

 and the section A -shaped; lateral margins very slightly converging 

 caudad of the middle, the caudal margin truncate, a moderate median 

 transverse and a broken longitudinal sulcus present. Mesonotum 

 very slightly less than three times the length of the head and 

 pronotum together, arcuate in section, very slightly expanding 

 caudad, a very slight median carination present cephalad, the whole 

 mesonotum elongate sub-cylindrical. Metanotum including the 

 median segment four-fifths the length of the mesonotum, arcuate 

 in section except caudad where it is flattened, slightly expanding 

 caudad, a slight carination present on all but the median segment, 

 which latter is less than a fifth the length of the metanotum sensu 

 stricttore, with its greatest width (caudal) about equal 

 to the length and the cephalic margin much narrower 

 than the caudal. Abdomen slightly shorter than 

 the thorax, the five proximal joints subequal in 

 length and similar in character and width, each seg- 

 ment being about three times as long as wide and 

 very slightly widened at the extremities; sixth 

 joint about four-fifths the length of the fifth ; seventh 

 joint slightly longer than the sixth, narrow proxi- 

 mad, inflated dorsad, ventrad and laterad in the 

 distal portion; eighth segment quite short, tapering 

 caudad; ninth segment slightly longer than the 

 eighth segment, moderately inflated but hardly 

 expanded laterad, the distal margin A -shaped when 

 seen from the caudal aspect ; supra-anal plate visible as a point between 

 the bases of the cerci ; subgenital opercule 

 tubular, moderately large, reaching to the 

 distal margin of the eighth segment, the 

 apical valve small with its margin with a 

 slight projection; cerci about as long as the 

 ninth segment, straight when seen from the 

 side, moderately arcuate when seen from the 

 dorsum, rather robust, trifid, the apical 

 pair of processes less robust than the median one which is

 the caudal, very slightly bowed dorso-ventrad. Cephalic femora 

 but slightly shorter than the head, pronotum and mesonotum 

 together, proximal flexure rather sharp ; cephalic tibiae surpassing the

 reaching to the middle of the second abdominal segment; median 

 tibiae slightly longer than the femora. ' Caudal femora reaching to the 

 apex of the sixth abdominal segment; caudal tibiae slightly longer 

 than the femora; caudal tarsi with the proximal joint about two- 

 thirds the entire length of the same. 



General color very pale greenish, becoming buff on the venter and 

 limbs, the head and pronotum ochraceous-buff mesad, a white lateral 

 line extending caudad from the antennae, bordering the eye dorsad and 

 becoming obsolete on the sides of the pronotum. Apex of the abdomen 

 cream-buff, slightly washed with ochraceous-buff.

The unique type was taken on bunch grass on the east slope of the 

 mountains. Upon being approached it violently shook the stems to 

 which it was clinging, apparently to conceal itself or frighten away its 

 enemies. Upon experimenting we found the insect would repeat this 

 performance as often as approached. 



DIAPHEROMERA Gray. 

 Diapheromera persimilis Caudell. 



Two females, one mature, the other not quite mature, taken on irri- 

 gated land along the Rio Grande near El Paso, July 10, are referred 

 to this species ; the mature individual was swept from tornillo or screw 

 bean, the other from thick weeds. After a careful study of the species 

 of the genus, a tabulation of their more important character in the 

 female sex, and of their measurements, we have reached the conclusion 

 that this species described from the vicinity of Brownsville extends 

 up the Rio Grande valley at least as far as El Paso. The cerci of the 

 specimens in hand fully answer CaudelFs description in being inter- 

 mediate in length between those of jemorata and veliei, while the

measurements as given below with those of the type female of 

 persimilis show the similarity of proportions. 



The proportions of the El Paso specimens are seen to approximate 

 very closely to those of the type female and we feel justified in con- 

 sidering them persimilis. Actual comparison with Brownsville females 

 or the acquisition of El Paso males would, however, make the deter- 

 mination more positive. No very close relationship exists to the 

 Mexican D. calcarata and comparison has been made with females of 

 femorata, veliei 4 and arizonensis. 



Diapheromora mesillana Seudder. 



Ten females, including one mature specimen and others in three 

 immature stages of growth, appear to represent this species, previously 

 known only from the male sex. When compared with the species 

 represented by the female sex in the collections before us they are 

 clearly different, as the following comparison shows : 



Head. Similar to arizonensis but more depressed. 



Pronotum. Much as in arizonensis, distinctly shorter than in 

 veliei. 



Dorsal apical abdominal segments. Longer and narrower than in 

 femorata, persimilis, and arizonensis, much as in veliei. 



Cerci. Longer than in all but persimilis and veliei, tapering, acute, 



4 Brunner (Insektenfam. Phasm., II, pp. 337, 338) has redescribed this species 

 from Texas under the name dolichocephala. He entirely overlooked the name 

 veliei as well as the species arizonensis Caudell, Carolina Seudder, mesillana 

 Seudder and persimilis Caudell.

grooved on the internal face, much shorter than veliei, much more acute 

 and less subequal than in persimilis. 



Subgenital opercule. Nearest to veliei, but blunter. 



A key to the females of the five species before us would be as follows : 



A.— Cerci hardly more than half the length of the eighth abdominal 

 segment. 

 B. — Subgenital opercule arcuate at the apex, . femorata. 



BB. —Subgenital opercule arcuato-truncate at the apex with a 

 distinct median projecting finger, . . arizonensis. 



A A. — Cerci decidedly more than half the length of the eighth abdominal 

 segment. 

 B. — Apical margin of the subgenital opercule not reaching to the 

 apical margin of the eighth dorsal abdominal segment. 

 C. — Head narrow, but little exceeding the cephalic width 

 of the mesonotum. Cerci as long as the ninth dorsal 



abdominal segment, . veliei. 



CC. — Head broad, half again as wide as the cephalic width 

 of the mesonotum. Cerci no more than half the 

 length of the ninth dorsal abdominal segment, 



mesillana. 



BB. — Apical margin of the subgenital opercule reaching to the 



apical margin of the eighth dorsal abdominal segment, 



persimilis. 



Three of the specimens of mesillana measure as follows : 



Of the series referred to mesillana, a single one (adult) was taken at 

 El Paso on July 17 on mesquite in the desert, an immature individual 

 was collected at the same place on July 10 on the irrigated land along 




126 PROCEEDING'S OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



the Rio Grande, while seven in various stages of growth were taken at 

 Deming on July 18 on the rabbit weed and mesquite flat, and a single 

 immature specimen was taken on the lower slopes of the Florida 

 Mountains, July 19. 



A bleached female specimen from Pecos, Texas, in the collection of 

 the Academy belongs to this species. It has been immersed in liquid 

 preservative at some time and in consequence is somewhat shrivelled, 

 but the character of the head and the apex of the abdomen show it 

 to be mesillana. 



The range of the species now extends from Reeves County, Texas, 

 to Luna County, New Mexico. 



CERATITES 5 n. subgenus. 



Closely related to true Diapheromera, but differing in the presence of 

 a pair of horns on the head in both sexes, 6 and in the peculiar recurved 

 and inflated margin of the subgenital opercule in the male. 



Type. — Diapheromera (Ceratites) covillece n. sp. 



This subgenus includes four and probably five species: the type 

 species, tamaulipensis Rehn from Tamaulipas, Mexico, and beckeri and 

 bidens Kaup 7 from Mexico, while saussurii Kirby 8 from Dominica 

 probably belongs in this group, although rather anomalous in the 

 uninflated median femora. 



Diapheromera (Ceratites) covilleae n. sp. 



Types: cT and 9 ; Franklin Mountains, altitude 4,500 feet, near 

 El Paso, El Paso County, Texas. July 9, 1907. On greasewood (Covil- 

 lea tridentata) . (Hebard and Rehn.) [Hebard Collection.] 



Compared with D. beckeri and bidens Kaup, its nearest allies, the 

 new species differs from the former in the head being longer than the 

 pronotum, in the distinctly larger size and in the unarmed ventral mar- 

 gins of the cephalic limbs; from bidens it differs in the distinctly larger 

 size, more distant horns and in the absence of granules from the head 

 and thoracic segments. The cerci and eighth and ninth dorsal abdomi- 



6 KepaTiTijg, one that has horns. 



6 Horns are absent from the head of a male of a new species from Mexico 

 (tamaulipensis Rehn), but the female of that species possesses such well-marked 

 cephalic appendages that we feel justified in considering their absence in the 

 male as purely accidental.

The male type is the only specimen of that sex seen by us. One 

 paratypic adult female, taken July 9, and two adult females taken 

 July 10 on the greasewood growth on the mesa at the east foot of the 

 Franklin Mountains, have been examined. A series of twelve immature 

 female specimens in about five different stages of growth are now 

 before us. These individuals are all from the Franklin Mountains 

 and mesa at the base of the same, July 9-11, except two from near 

 Alamogordo, one taken April 23, 1902, by Viereck and Rehn, the other 

 in the adjacent Dry Canyon, July 13, by Hebard and Rehn. All the 

 stages but one are represented in the material taken July 9-11, the 

 April specimen being smaller than any of the others. The half 

 developed individuals show an interesting protective color adaptation, 

 the base color being apple or oil green with the abdomen and limbs 

 annulate with olive, the result being a color scheme blending wonder- 

 fully with the peculiar joint-like terminal twigs of the greasewood on

130 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [Feb., 



which the species is found and feeds. As individuals near maturity 

 this color pattern is lost, the dull coloration of the female type sup- 

 planting it. The two mesa adults have the hoary suffusion much 

 stronger and more extensive than in the female type, the limbs and the 

 greater portion of the body being much lighter than in the type. The 

 cephalic horns are well indicated in all the immature specimens. 



A series of seven females from Pecos, Reeves County, Texas, in the 

 Academy collection are referred to this species, although rather smaller 

 and slenderer, the latter difference probably being due to the fact 

 that all have been immersed for some time in a liquid preservative and 

 in consequence there has been considerable shrivelling. The essential 

 characters, i.e., width of head, horns and form of femoral spines and 

 apex of abdomen, are the same as in the El Paso specimens. 



ACRIDIDJE. 



TELMATETTIX Hancock. 

 Telmatettix aztecus (Saussure). 



In a canyon in the Florida Mountains, at about 5,100 feet elevation, 

 along a little rill of water which trickled a few dozen yards over a 

 rock slope and thin top soil, this species was found quite plentiful on 

 July 19. Specimens were noticed only on such spots as had been 

 moistened by the water, a series of fourteen males and eleven females 

 being taken in a short time. The insects were active and flew rapidly 

 about when disturbed. There is a considerable range of color varia- 

 tion in the lot, many shades of browns and grays being represented, 

 with several decidedly rufous individuals, and a number with com- 

 plete or incomplete "saddle" of blackish brown caudad of the broadest 

 portion of the pronotum. In one specimen the cephalic and median 

 limbs and the ventral margin of the lateral lobes of the pronotum are 

 ringed or spotted with brilliant red. All the series have the pronotum 

 elongate. 



PARATETTIX Bolivar. 

 Paratettix mexioanus (Saussure). 



A male of this species was taken on irrigated land along the Rio 

 Grande, atjEl Paso, July 10, and a female was captured on cultivated 

 ground at Albuquerque, September 14. 



ACRYDIUM Geoffroy. 

 Acrydium crassum (Morse). 



A single male of this species was taken at Cloudcroft, July 15, being 

 beaten from vegetation on the steep hillside of James Canyon at an 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 131 



elevation of about 8,800 feet. When compared with two male repre- 

 sentatives of the species from near Manitou, Colorado, it is seen to 

 differ only in the slightly more arcuate cephalic section of the median 

 carina of the pronotum. 



The only previous New Mexican record of the species was of its cap- 

 ture at Las Vegas, April 13. 



Acrydium inourvatum (Hancock). 



A pair of this species, taken at Fort Wingate, April 23 and May 8, 

 1908, by John Woodgate, have been examined. 



The only definite record from New Mexico published previous to 

 this date was from 6,500 feet elevation on the Rio Ruidoso, White 

 Mountains, Lincoln County, July 30. The species has been recorded 

 from Washington and Colorado. 



MERMIRIA Stal. 

 Mermiria bivittata (Serville). 



This widely distributed species is represented by a series of thirty-three 

 specimens, taken at the following localities : Spofford, Kinney County, 

 Texas, July 8 (one nymph) ; Johnstone, Valverde County, Texas, July 8 

 (one nymph) ; Seminole, Valverde County, Texas, July 8 (1 cT) ; El Paso, 

 July 10-11 (9 6", 2 9); Albuquerque, September 14 (12 d\ 7 9). 

 In size there is a very appreciable amount of variation, particularly 

 in the male sex, while several types of coloration are easily recognized. 

 The Albuquerque series is rather dull in color, with broad postocular 

 bars which infringe on the dorsum of the pronotum in the male; the 

 El Paso specimens represent two color types, one ochraceous with 

 prominent postocular bars infringing on the dorsum of the pronotum 

 and with a distinct or siibobsolete median occipital stripe in the males, 

 the other light greenish with the postocular bars narrower, limited to 

 the lateral lobes and sharply defined, the occiput usually without a 

 median line. The Seminole male belongs to the first type mentioned 

 from El Paso. The pale subcostal streak is present on the tegmina of 

 all the series, though varying somewhat in intensity and also in color, 

 ranging from white to bright green. The form of the fastigium and 

 of the rostrum when seen from the lateral aspect is subject to consider- 

 able variation, the latter particularly exhibiting a surprising range, from 

 a type with the facial line regular from the fastigio-facial angle to the 

 clypeal suture to one with a very evident though obtuse angle between 

 the antennal bases. The Albuquerque series was taken on cultivated 

 ground, while at El Paso the species was encountered among tornillo 




132 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



bushes in irrigated ground along the Rio Grande. The Seminole 

 specimen was taken from grass growing on a sandy spot. 



Mermiria texana Brunei-. 



This beautiful species is essentially one of the rough desert moun- 

 tains and foothills, the altitude at which it occurs being between 

 4,000 and 5,500 feet. On the rugged slopes of the Franklin Moun- 

 tains and their broken foothills three males and one immature 

 female were captured on July 9, while on a rocky desert hill at Aden a 

 pair were taken on July 21. An immature female from the lower 

 slopes of the Florida Mountains, July 19, belongs to this species. A 

 series of nine adult specimens of the species in the brown phase is now 

 before us and surprisingly little difference in coloration is exhibited. 

 Aside from the medio-longitudinal bar on the head and pronotum 

 which is pale in one specimen, the only appreciable color variations 

 are that the caudal tibiae range from pale pinkish, through vermilion 

 to solferino, and the antennas are more obscure in some specimens than 

 in others. 



Individuals of the species are alert and quick to take wing, in fact 

 this is one of the most difficult insects to capture among the Orthoptera 

 of the Southwest. 



PAROPOMALA Scudder. 



In studying the series of Paropomala contained in the collection it 

 was found necessary to critically examine the descriptions of all the 

 species of the genus. Aside from the unique and little known P. 

 dissimilis Bruner, the only species not easily located was P. virgata 

 Scudder, very briefly described from Mesilla, New Mexico, between 

 Gila Bend and Yuma, Arizona, Palm Springs, Cahon Pass, Lancaster 

 and Kern City, California. In reply to a request for typical material 

 of the species, Prof. Morse very kindly loaned us cotypes from all 

 the typical localities, and on careful study it develops that at least 

 two species are included in the series on which virgata was based. 

 The Mesilla individuals belong to a short comparatively robust species 

 found at several localities in the Rio Grande valley, while the southern 

 Californian and Arizonan individuals belong to the species later called 

 pallida by Bruner. One cotype from Kern City may be distinct from 

 pallida of the Mohave, Colorado and Gila desert regions, having the 

 fastigium very broad and the pronotum narrower than usual, but with- 

 out additional material its separation does not seem warranted, inas- 

 much as forty-nine specimens of the species from Arizona, California 

 and Nevada exhibit a great amount of individual variation. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 133 



As no single type or pair of types of virgata was originally designated, 

 and the original diagnosis being too brief to give any assistance, the 

 selection as typical virgata of either species known to exist in the 

 type series is open to us, and in view of Mesilla, New Mexico, standing 

 first in the list of localities the Rio Grande form is here selected as true 

 Paropomala virgata. 



To assist in the work of determination a key to the species in hand 

 was constructed which is here reproduced to aid future workers. As 

 stated above all the species have been examined except P. dissimilis 

 Bruner. 



A. — Tegmina not reaching tip of abdomen or even tip of caudal 



femora; subgenital plate of male elongate, half as longjagain 



as the last ventral segment. 



B. — Antennae of female as long as the caudal femora ; eyes smaller, 



the interocular space in the male decidedly more than 



half the length from that region to the apex of the 



fastigium; caudal femora longer, 



wyomingensis (Thorn.) [cylindrica Bruner]. 

 BB. — Antennae of female shorter than the caudal femora; eyes 

 larger, the interocular space in the male less than half 

 the length from that region to the apex of the fastigium ; 

 caudal femora shorter, .... calamus Scudd. 

 AA. — Tegmina surpassing the tips of the caudal femora, generally 

 reaching the apex of the abdomen and in some cases sur- 

 passing it. Subgenital plate of male (at least in the species 

 where known) not very long, hardly longer than the last 

 ventral segment. 

 B. — Form rather slender or moderately robust (for the genus), 

 slightly compressed; head moderately produced. 

 C. — Tegmina of male hot exceeding the apex of the abdo- 

 men; occiput more or less appreciably inflated; 

 caudal limbs rather slender; cerci styliform, com- 

 paratively slender. 

 D. — Size larger (body of male 18.5-24 mm., of female 

 27-36.5 mm.); antenna? more depressed pro- 

 portionately; caudal margin of the disk of the 

 pronotum arcuate; metazona more than two- 

 thirds the length of the prozona, pallida Bruner. 

 DD. — Size smaller (body of male 16 mm.); antennae 

 less depressed proportionately; caudal margin 

 of the disk of the pronotum very bluntly obtuse- 

 angulate; metazona two-thirds the length of 

 the prozona, . perpallida Rehn and Hebard. 

 CC. — Tegmina of male exceeding the apex of the abdomen; 

 occiput not appreciably inflated; caudal limbs 

 proportionately more robust; cerci styliform, mod- 

 erately robust, virgata Scudder. 




134 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



BB. — Form very slender, considerably compressed; head strongly 

 produced. (Size rather small, cT 18-21 mm., 9 26-27.5 

 mm.), acris Rehn and Hebard. 



A single imperfect specimen from Lathrop, California, seems to 

 indicate the presence of a quite distinct species in the San Joaquin 

 valley. 



Paropomala calamus Scudder. 



Rather unexpectedly this species was encountered at three places 

 in or adjacent to the Rio Grande valley. On the bare desert slopes of 

 the Franklin Mountains at El Paso a single immature specimen was 

 taken on July 9 at an elevation of 4,500 feet; a series of six adult and 

 five immature males and nine immature females was taken at Aden, 

 July 21, while one adult male and two adult females were taken at 

 Albuquerque on September 14 in dry grass. At Aden the species was 

 taken chiefly in grass prairie land, where it was found clinging tightly 

 to blades of grass, while at Albuquerque it was found in the river 

 bottom-land. The immature specimens from Aden represent three 

 stages of growth. 



As no measurements have been published for this species the follow- 

 ing may prove of service : 



Albuquerqw 

 Length of body, 

 Length of head, 

 Length of pronotum, . 

 Length of tegmen, . 

 Length of caudal femur, 



The specimens from Albuquerque are all in the green phase, while 

 the Aden series and the Franklin Mountains specimen are in the pale 

 brownish and hoary white phase. The adult males from Aden and 

 nearly half the immature series have the hoary white suffusion very 

 strongly marked, usually covering the head, pronotum, pleura and 

 caudal femora. 



The only previous record of this species is that of the types from 

 Lancaster, California, in the Mohave desert. 



Paropomala virgata Scudder. 



This species appears to be one restricted to the eastern side of the 

 continental divide, the only exact records being from the Rio Grande 

 valley and the region adjacent to it. At El Paso a series of seven 

 males and one female was taken July 10-11 on irrigated land along 

 the Rio Grande and in dry grass in sand near the edge of the mesa. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 135 



A single male was taken in dry grass at Aden, July 21, while at Albu- 

 querque, September 14, a series of thirteen females was taken in dry 

 grass and on cultivated ground, chiefly on the latter. In size there is 

 a slight amount of variation, but not enough to cause any difficulty 

 in recognizing the species. An average pair measure as follows : 



El Paso- Albuquerque. 

 Length of body, . 

 Length of head, . 

 Length of pronotum, 

 Length of tegmen, 

 Length of caudal femur, 



In coloration the species appears to be quite uniform, although the 

 Albuquerque series is darker than the individuals from the El Pasan 

 region, all examined being in a buff and brown phase except one Albu- 

 querque specimen which demonstrates the existence of a green phase. 



The comparatively robust build of the species, particularly of the 

 females, will readily serve to differentiate it from its allies. 



The only positive records for the species aside from those given here 

 are from the vicinity of Mesilla and Las Cruces, Donna Ana County, 

 New Mexico. 



Paropomala acris Rehn and Hebard. 



This species, which was described from Railroad Pass, Cochise County, 

 Arizona, was found to be fairly numerous at Aden, July 21, chiefly 

 in grass prairie land, a series of eight adult and two immature males 

 and two adult and three immature females being taken. A pair 

 was also taken at El Paso: the male, July 11, clinging to a thorn of a 

 mesquite near the edge of the mesa; the female, July 10, on prickly 

 pear (Opuntia sp.) in the greasewood belt at the east base of the 

 Franklin Mountains. 



The El Paso male is of nearly the same size as the type, but all the 

 Aden males are smaller. This difference in specimens from the two 

 localities holds true in the female sex, the two Aden specimens of that 

 sex being uniform in size and both smaller than the El Paso individual. 

 The following measurements may be of interest. 




136 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



The majority of the Aden series is more grayish ochraceous than the 

 type, the remainder being very similar to the Railroad Pass individual. 

 The El Paso male is greenish yellow dorsad, while the female from the 

 same locality is decidedly green with the tegmina roseate. 



The only localities from which the species is known are those recorded 

 here and the type locality — Railroad Pass, Arizona. 



SYRBULA Stal. 

 Syrbula admirabilis (Uhler). 



A single male taken July 8 at Johnstone, Valverde County, Texas, 

 belongs to this species. 



Syrbula fuscovittata Thomas. 



A mature male and an immature female taken in Dry Canyon, 

 Sacramento Mountains, July 13, and an adult female taken at 4,500 

 feet elevation in the Franklin Mountains, July 9, are referable to this 

 species. Both adult specimens are in the brown phase of coloration. 

 The male from Dry Canyon was taken at an elevation of about 5,000 

 feet, in the lower portion of the juniper and pinon zone. 



B00TETTIX Brunei-. 

 Bodtettix argentatus Brunei-. 



This interesting grasshopper, which seems never to leave the branches 

 of the greasewood (Covillea tridentata), was taken, July 9 to 11, at a 

 number of points in the greasewood belt on the mesa northeast of El 

 Paso and on the lower slopes of the Franklin Mountains. The series 

 from the El Pasan region, numbering twenty-four males, fourteen 

 females and eight nymphs, and two females and one nymph taken 

 July 13 in the greasewood of the lower portion of Dry Canyon, Sacra- 

 mento Mountains (elevation 4,800-4,900 feet), and the growth of the 

 same shrub on the alluvial slope at the mouth of the same canyon, 

 exhibits a very considerable amount of variation in size, the extremes 

 of each sex being as follows : 



In color numerous little variations are noticeable, none, however, 

 important enough to call for special note. In all the series the tegmina 

 are more or less strongly maculate, although the markings are limited 

 in the majority of the specimens to the vicinity of the anal area. The 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 137 



striking pearl markings on the pronotum, pleura and limbs are present 

 in all the specimens, even in those in the immature condition, the bril- 

 liancy of these markings in the living insect being retained by a good 

 proportion of the series. 



The stridulation of Bootettix is a faint buzzing szszszsz terminated by 

 a distinct whirr and repeated at intervals. 



EKITETTIX Bruner. 

 Eritettix variabilis Bruner. 



A single female of this species was taken at Cloudcroft, July 14, and 

 eleven males were collected at Aden, July 21. At Cloudcroft it was 

 taken in a mountain meadow, while at Aden the males were all collected 

 among a scant covering of desert plants on the rocky hillside. As in 

 the case of the other species of this genus, these individuals were found 

 to be extremely active. 



The males show a considerable amount of variation in size, but are 

 rather uniform in coloration. However, none of the males have their 

 color pattern as contrasted as the female, this being chiefly due to the 

 uniform dorsal color of the males, the female having the pair of black- 

 ish dorsal lines quite distinct. The supplementary dorsal carinse of 

 the pronotum are rather well marked over the whole dorsum of the 

 pronotum in some males, indicated only on the metazona in otherrs 

 and entirely absent in a few, while the female possesses weakly devel- 

 oped ones. 



This species has previously been recorded from Silver City, Grant 

 County, and La Trementina, San Miguel County, New Mexico, and 

 Douglas, Cochise County, Arizona. 



OPEIA McNeill. 

 Opeia imperfecta Bruner. 



During brief train stops made on July 8 at Dunlay, Medina County, 

 and Spofford, Kinney County, Texas, this species was captured in a 

 grassy spot under mesquite trees at the former locality and in dry grass 

 at the latter. A single male was taken at Dunlay and four of each sex 

 were collected at Spofford. 



These specimens demonstrate the unreliability of the length of 

 the tegmina and the form of the apex of the same as specific characters 

 in this genus. The typical specimens examined by Bruner all pos- 

 sessed rather abbreviate tegmina, "about one-half ( 9 ) or nearly three- 

 fourths (c?) as long as the abdomen, their apices pointed or acumi- 

 nate." In every character and every proportion the Dunlay and 

 Spofford individuals fully agree with the original description, except 




138 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb. r 



that the males have the tegmina reaching or slightly exceeding the 

 apex of the abdomen, while the females possess tegmina much over 

 half as long as the abdomen, in all of that sex failing to reach the apices 

 of the caudal femora by less than the length of the pronotum. The 

 apices of the tegmina are more or less narrowly rounded in all the 

 specimens. On examining a number of representatives of the Great 

 Plains 0. obscura, which it may be added has a considerable amount 

 of variation in the tegminal length, it is noticed that individuals with 

 rather short tegmina have the tips of the same pointed, while those 

 with longer tegmina have the same portions rounded. This is true of 

 almost all of a number of individuals of the species, and no doubt 

 explains the presence of rounded apices to the tegmina in the long- 

 winged Spofford and Dunlay individuals. 



To the characters given by Bruner for separating Opeia imperfecta 

 from 0. obscura might be added the less inflated character of the head 

 in imperfecta with the resultant straighter and less arcuate occiput. 



This species was described from southwestern Texas and Jimulco 

 and Comancho, Zacatecas, Mexico. 



AMPHITOKNUS McNeill. 

 Amphitornus ornatus McNeill. 



On a desert hillside and on grassy prairie at Aden this species was 

 found rather numerous on July 21, three individuals of each sex being 

 taken. At an elevation of 5,300 feet in the pinon and juniper zone of 

 Dry Canyon, Sacramento Mountains, a single male was taken, July 13, 

 on bare ground among low bushes on the steep canyon wall. At 

 both localities the species was found to be exceedingly wary and diffi- 

 cult to capture. The only previous New Mexican record of the species 

 was of its capture at Little Mountain, east of Mesilla Park, Donna Ana 

 County, on July 1. 



CORDILLACRIS Rehn. 

 Cordillacris occipitalis (Thomas). 



On the grassy rolling prairie at Aden this species was found fairly 

 plentiful on July 21, a series of fifteen males and ten females being 

 taken. A female of the species was also taken during a train stop at 

 Faywood, Luna County, New Mexico, on July 20. 



An appreciable amount of variation in size is noticeable in both 

 sexes, but particularly in the male, while the general tone of the basic 

 coloration varies from a predominating ochre type to one with gray- 

 brown the main element, with, however, one specimen decidedly brick 

 red in general tone. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 139 



The only previous record of this species in New Mexico is of its occur- 

 rence in Johnson's Basin, Socorro County, where it was taken, June 22, 

 by Townsend. The record of its occurrence at Alamogordo, New 

 Mexico, made by Rehn, 9 should be corrected, as a re-examination 

 of the individual there recorded shows it to be the very closely allied 

 C. cinerea. 



Cordillacris cinerea (Brunei-). 



Two females, one taken at Aden, July 21, on grassy prairie, and the 

 other from prickly pear (Opuntia sp.) growing on the greasewood covered 

 mesa northeast of El Paso, July 10, are referred to this species. These 

 specimens are very close to C. occipitalis, but seem to be separable 

 from the specimens of the latter by the more protuberant eyes, the 

 narrower fastigium and the more constricted interocular space. How- 

 ever, there is a great amount of variation along these lines in specimens 

 of undoubted occipitalis, and an examination of the type material of the 

 species may show no valid grounds for retaining cinerea as distinct from 

 occipitalis. The color character given by Bruner 10 to separate the two 

 species does not appear to be of value, as specimens of occipitalis 

 have the caudal tibiae various shades of testaceous as well as "in part 

 red or reddish." This form has been recorded with some query as to 

 the species from sandhills near Mesilla, New Mexico, June 27-30 

 and Sierra Blanca, Texas, June 26, while material from Alamogordo, 

 New Mexico, April 9, belongs to this type. 

 Cordillacris apache n. sp. 



Types : c? and 9 ; Silver City, Grant County, New Mexico. Juty 20,

Related to C. crenulata (Bruner) and C. pima Rehn, differing from 

 the former in the narrower ventral portion of the head, more retreating 

 facial line, narrower interspace between the eyes, narrower tegmina and 

 slightly more elongate caudal limbs; from C. pima it differs in the 

 shorter caudal limbs, in the more constricted lateral carinas of the 

 pronotum and in the rectangulate angle of the fastigium in the female 

 sex. 



In determining the series representing this species it was found 

 absolutely necessary to ascertain what true C. crenulata was, the origi- 

 nal description of the latter species hardly being explicit enough to 

 place the name on the northern form (Montana to Colorado) or the new 

 one, the difficulty being further augmented by the fact that Bruner

140 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



originally placed Silver City among his localities for crenulata. The 

 description of crenulata was dissected and tabulated in parallel columns 

 of agreement with the two species in hand, but no definite conclusion 

 could be reached, so in response to an inquiry Prof. Brunei' wrote as 

 follows: "The insect called Cordillacris crenulata was described chiefly 

 from west Nebraska specimens, although I had at the time other 

 specimens from New Mexico in my collection." In view of this state- 

 ment it seems perfectly legitimate to consider the northern form, 

 which we have before us from McCook and Sioux Counties, Nebraska, 

 and Antonito, Rocky Ford, Colorado Springs and Fort Collins, Colorado, 

 as the true crenulata. 



Size medium; form rather similar to that of C. crenulata. 

 Head with its dorsal length subequal to that of the pronotum, 

 moderately but regularly ascending to the fastigium when seen 

 from the side, the fastigium slightly descending; interocular region

In addition to the types a series of six adult males, six adult females 

 and one female nymph have been examined. Of this representation 

 four males, two females and the nymph are from Silver City, July 20; 

 two males and two females from Aden, July 21 ; one female from the 

 Florida Mountains, July 19, and one female from Spalding, Luna 

 County, New Mexico, July 20. 



In size the specimens are moderately uniform, one or more females 

 being slightly larger than the type, while one male is somewhat smaller 

 than the type of that sex. The coloration exhibits some little varia- 

 tion, but such differences as are seen are chiefly due to intensification 

 or lightening of the general pattern and shades. The antennse in some 

 specimens are buffy proximad. 



The habitat of this species at Aden was found to be a grassy rolling 

 prairie, dotted with an extremely scanty and widely scattered growth 

 of very low mesquite and a few sotols (Dasylirion sp.). The insects 

 were found most plentiful where the grass was most abundant. At 

 Silver City specimens were found in numbers among short grasses 

 on the hillsides. 



PHLIBOSTROMA Scudder. 

 Phlibostroma quadrimaculatum (Thomas). 



An immature specimen of this species was taken at Silver City, July 

 20, in a small patch of short grass. 



This is the first definite record of the species from southern New 

 Mexico. 



ORPHULELLA Giglio-Tos. 

 Orphulella picturata Scudder. 



A single male of this species was taken at Dunlay, Medina County 

 Texas, during a train stop on July 8. This specimen was found in 

 the same surroundings as Opeia testacea. 



Orphulella pelidna (Burmeister). 



A male and two females of this species were taken on cultivated 

 ground at Albuquerque, September 14. The male and one female 

 are in the brown phase, the remaining female being of the green type. 

 Comparison was made with individuals of the species from Nebraska. 



The only previous New Mexican records are of captures of the species 

 at Albuquerque and Mesilla. 



DICHROMORPHA Morse. 

 Dichromorpha viridis (Scudder). 



At San Antonio, Texas, July 8, a single female of this species was 

 taken on a lot near the railroad station.

CHLOEALTIS Harris. 

 Chloealtis abdominalis (Thomas). 



■• On the edge of a field flanked by a forest of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga 

 miicronata) at Cloudcroft, one adult male and seven immature speci- 

 mens of this species were taken on July 14. The adult specimen was 

 located by his stridulation, although it was in the middle of the after- 

 noon. The note of this insect was like that of individuals of the same 

 species heard in Michigan. 



When compared with a series of males of the species from Pequaming, 

 Michigan, Yellowstone Park, and Manitou, Colorado, the Cloudcroft 

 specimen is seen to be appreciably smaller, the measurements being 

 as follows: Length of body, 15.7 mm.; length of pronotum, 3.3 mm.; 

 length of tegmen, 8.8 mm.; length of caudal femur, 11.2 mm. 



The previous records of this species in New Mexico are from Beulah, 

 San Miguel County, and Truchas Peak, Rio Arriba-Mora Counties. 



CHORTHIPPUS Fieber. 

 Chorthippus curtipennis (Harris). 



One male and two females of this species were collected at Cloud- 

 croft on July 14 and 15. These specimens were taken in clamp grassy 

 situations, the species being by no means common. 



Beulah, San Miguel County, and Aqua Fria Park, Colfax County, 

 .are the previously known New Mexican localities for the species. 



GOMPHOCERTTS Thunberg. . 

 Gomphooerus clavatus Thomas. 



At Cloudcroft this species was found to be abundant in grassy moun- 

 tain meadows, particularly along the edges of the forest. Here a 

 series of fifteen males and sixteen females were taken on July 14 and 15. 

 It was noticed that the species was very hard to find before ten o'clock 

 in the morning, although quite abundant during the heat of the after- 

 noon. 



The series is quite uniform in size, but in color there is in a number 

 of specimens a pronounced mixing and lining with shades of brown and 

 ochre which is not seen in the other more uniformly colored indi- 

 viduals. This variable tendency is more apparent in the female sex. 

 None of the individuals from Cloudcroft present areas or even traces 

 of green in their coloration. A single female from Truchas Peak, 

 New Mexico, taken August 2, 1902, by W. P. Cockerell, examined in this 

 connection, has considerable green in its coloration. The previous 

 exact New Mexican records for the species were from Cloudcroft and 

 above timber-line, 13,000-14,000 feet, on Truchas Peak.

 Psoloessa texana Scudder. 



If further evidence is needed to support the opinion recently ex- 

 pressed by the authors (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1908, pp. 381-383) 

 regarding the impossibility of differentiating the four nominal species 

 of the genus Psoloessa, the one hundred and forty-three specimens 

 examined in this connection furnishes it, The data here given on the 

 variability in this species should be considered supplementary to that 

 presented in the paper mentioned above. 



The typical buddiana type is represented by four specimens, typical 

 ferruginea by nine, typical maculipennis by eleven and typical texana 

 by eight, a total of twenty-three per cent, of the series, leaving an inter- 

 mediate series of one hundred and eleven specimens or seventy-seven 

 per cent., divided as follows; 



A. — Sharing characters of buddiana and ferruginea, one individual. 

 B. — Sharing characters of buddiana and maculipennis, forty-seven 



individuals.

 and at the foot of the Florida Mountains it was taken from the bare 

 ground in greasewood (Covillea) areas, while in Dry Canyon, in the 

 Franklin and Florida Mountains, and at Silver City it was taken from 

 canyon and hill slopes usually covered with low vegetation. At Aden 

 the species frequented a variety of habitats, being taken on a rocky 

 hillside, in grass prairie land and from areas of dry grass in sand, being 

 most abundant in the latter situation, while at Deming it was taken 

 on the rabbit-weed and mesquite plain. 



STIRAPLEURA 11 Scudder. 

 Stirapleura pusilla Scudder. 



A series of thirty males and thirteen females are referred to this 

 species, which seems to present quite a little variation in minor struc- 

 tural characters and size and to a considerable extent in color. Five 

 males and four females were taken at Silver City, July 20, on rough 

 slopes, the remainder of the series, twenty-five males and nine females, 

 being from Aden, July 21, where the species was found in all the three 

 types of surroundings examined, but was noted in greatest numbers 

 in grass prairie. The Silver City specimens are smaller than the Aden 

 individuals, although both series average larger than the original 

 measurements. The proportions of an average pair from each locality

At Aden, July 21, this species was found in grassy prairie land, on

 a series of thirteen males, one female and seven nymphs being taken. 



11 Stirapleura mescalero Rehn (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1902, p. 719) is 

 seen on re-examination of the type and comparison with material now in hand 

 to be Psoloessa texana Scudder. The original reference to Stirapleura was caused 

 by the degree of dorsal visibility of the lateral foveolse, a character which appears 

 to us to be almost worthless for separating the two genera, depending as it does 

 on the angle from which the head is viewed.

146 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



At Silver City, July 20, a single male was taken, while one male and 

 three females were secured at Albuquerque, September 14. 



The Albuquerque individuals are quite dull colored, with, however, 

 a longitudinal line present on the costal areas of the tegmina in three 

 of the four specimens. 



This species has previously been recorded from Mesilla Park and 

 Chaves, New Mexico. 



AULOCARA Scudder. 

 Aulooara rufum Scudder. 



A single freshly moulted female of this species was taken at Silver 

 City, July 20. It is rather dull in color, somewhat resembling speci- 

 mens from Antonito and Nephista, Colorado, the head, pronotum, 

 pleura and caudal femora being covered with numerous small blotches 

 of olive green. 



The only previous New Mexican record was La Cueva, Organ 

 Mountains, September 3. 



AEPHIA St&l. 

 Arphia luteola Scudder. 



A single female taken at Spofford, Texas, July 8, belongs to this 

 species. The disk of the wing is vermilion in color instead of yellow- 

 ish, but there can be no doubt of the specific identity of the specimen. 



Arphia arcta Scudder. 



A male and three females of this species, taken at Fort Wingate, Mc- 

 Kinley County, New Mexico, by John Woodgate, have been examined. 

 The dates represented are April 25, May 11 and August 20, 1908. 

 The specimens have been compared with Beulah, New Mexico, and 

 Jerome, Arizona, material. Three of the four individuals possess red 

 or reddish wings. 



Arphia teporata Scudder. 



On the desert slopes of the Franklin Mountains near El Paso, at 

 elevations of from 4,200 to 4,800 feet, this species was found gener- 

 ally distributed and a series of three males and four females were taken 

 on July 9. Two males were also taken on the edge of the mesa near 

 El Paso, July 11, while a single male was taken at 5,300 feet in the 

 Florida Mountains and one female at Aden, July 21. 



In the Florida Mountains but two specimens were seen, both in 

 dense oak scrub near bare rock slopes, while at Aden a few were seen 

 on the hill visited at that locality, but the species was very wary and 

 difficult to collect.

ENCOPTOLOPHUS Scudder. 

 Encoptolophus ooloradensis Brunei-. 



A pair of this interesting species was taken in dry grass along the 

 railroad tracks at Spofford, Kinney County, Texas, July 8. The species 

 was somewhat plentiful and very swift of flight. 



This is the first record of the species from Texas. 



Encoptolophus texensis Brunei-. 



In suitable locations, such as irrigated and grass prairie land, through 

 southern Arizona and New Mexico and western Texas, this species 

 will no doubt be found in fair numbers. 



In Texas, two males were collected at Spofford, July 8, while a series 

 of thirteen males and eight females were taken, July 10-11, at El Paso, 

 all except one from irrigated land. At Albuquerque three males and 

 eleven females were secured, September 14, on irrigated land, while a 

 single female was attracted to light at Deming, July 20. A pair were 

 taken in grass prairie land at Aden, July 21, while a single female was 

 taken in the greasewood belt at Alamogordo, July 13. 



The specimen from Ysleta, El Paso County, Texas, recorded as E. 

 costalis, 12 proves on re-examination to be E. texensis, which was unde- 

 scribed when this record was published. A female specimen taken at 

 Roswell, New Mexico (August, 1902, at light, T. D. A. Cockerell), 

 shows the presence of the species a considerable distance up the Pecos 

 Valley. 



In size there is a considerable amount of individual variation, a num- 

 ber of specimens of each sex being both larger and smaller than the 

 measurements given by Bruner. The dimensions of several of these 

 specimens may be of interest.

Taking as units the two most extensive series here examined, the 

 El Paso representation averages slightly larger than that from 

 Albuquerque, but the variation within each is considerable. 



All the specimens examined from Texas and New Mexico are in a 

 brownish phase, no approach being noticed to the green phase. The 

 Albuquerque and Deming specimens are quite grayish, the Alamo- 

 gordo one reddish and the Spofford lot quite blackish, but the tegminal 

 pattern is retained by all the individuals examined. 



This species is now known from Carrizo Springs, Spofford, Ysleta 

 and El Paso, Texas; Roswell, Alamogordo, Albuquerque, Mesilla, 

 Aden and Deming, New Mexico; Tucson, Florence, Phoenix and San 

 Bernardino Ranch, Arizona, and southern California. 



In its actions this species is more active than E. sordidus, but much 

 less so than E. costalis. 



HIPPISCUS Saussure. 

 Hippiscus corallipes (Haldeman). 



On the bare spots of an irrigated field along the Rio Grande below 

 El Paso, two males and two females of this species were taken on July 

 11. At Aden, July 21, three of each sex were taken in all the situations 

 found at that locality, but it was most commonly found in grass prairie 

 land, where the species was very wary. All of the specimens have 

 the internal faces of the caudal femora red or pinkish-red except 

 the females from El Paso, one of which has the same areas deep blue, 

 the other purplish. 

 Hippiscus cupidus Scudder. 



Three males of this species have been examined from Fort Wingate, 

 New Mexico, taken April 26, 1908, by John Woodgate. A compari- 

 son with males from Jerome, Arizona, reveals no differences worthy 

 of mention. 



The range of this species now extends from Jerome and Prescott, 

 Arizona, to northwestern New Mexico. The record of H. leprosus 

 from the Pinal Mountains, Arizona, 13 belongs to this species. 

 Hippiscus affriotus Scudder. 



A single female of this species was taken at Fort Wingate, New 

 Mexico, June 2, 1908, by John Wingate. 



The range of the species is extended considerably to the southward 

 by this record, which is the first of the species from New Mexico ; Range- 

 ley, on the lower White River, western Colorado, being the nearest 

 locality from which it had previously been recorded.

DISSOSTEIRA Scudder. 

 Dissosteira Carolina (Linnaeus). 



Two females of this species were taken on cultivated ground at 

 Albuquerque, September 14. 



SPHARAGEMON Scudder. 

 Spharagemon collare (Scudder). 



A pair of this species taken at Albuquerque, September 14, on irri- 

 gated land are in the collection. They are closer to race angustipennis 

 than to the other forms of the species. 



In this location this species was extremely difficult to capture, par- 

 tially on account of its powerful flight and its extreme wariness. This 

 is the only locality in New Mexico from which the species has been 

 recorded. 



T0M0N0TUS Saussure. 

 Tomonotus aztecus Saussure. 



Apparently this species is generally distributed over that portion 

 of western Texa? between San Antonio and the Pecos River, specimens 

 before us being from Lacoste, Medina County (1 c?), Hondo, Medina 

 County (1 9 ), D'Hanis, Medina County (2 6", 2 9 ), Sabinal, Uvalde 

 County (1(5*), Spofford, Kinney County (2 cf), and Samuels, Valverde 

 County (2 9 ), all taken during train stops on July 8. 



The Samuels specimens are quite pale, while two of the D'Hanis 

 series are quite uniform blackish-gray. The Sabinal, Spofford and 

 Hondo individuals are as a rule quite dark, the Sabinal and Hondo 

 representatives with the tegminal markings distinct, while the Lacoste 

 specimen tends toward ferruginous. 



The senior author's Lactista boscanus u from Ysleta, El Paso County, 

 Texas, is referable to this species. As shown by Caudell 15 the speci- 

 mens recorded by Scudder and Cockerell as Lactista pellepidus also 

 belong to this form. 



The range of this species in the United States is now known to 

 extend from central Texas to south-central Arizona, north to the 

 Organ Mountains of New Mexico. 



MESTOBREGMA Scudder. 

 Mestobregma fusoifrons (Stal). 



Five males and one female of this form were taken at Spofford, Texas, 

 July 8 ; one male and two females also being taken at Dunlay, Medina 

 County, Texas, the same date.

Mestobregma obliterata Brunei-. 



A single female from Albuquerque, September 14, is referred to this 

 species. 



Mestobregma plattei (Thomas). 



Three males and one female of this species were taken at Silver City, 

 July 20; two females also being included in the series from the lower 

 slopes of the Florida Mountains, taken July 19. At Silver City it was 

 captured on low rounded hills, while in the Florida range it was found 

 sparingly on bare precipitous rocks, where it was noticed to be very 

 vigorous and wary. 



These specimens show some approach to the closely allied M . rubri- 

 penne from southern Arizona, but the general coloration is nearer 

 plattei, while the slender caudal femora are not at all like the compara- 

 tively robust ones of rubripenne. 



The range of this species is now known to extend from Wyoming 

 south along the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains to Colorado, 

 occurring also at Magdalena, New Mexico, and the localities given above. 



DEROTMEMA Scudder. 

 Derotmema laticinctum Scudder. 



This characteristic species of the desert regions of southern New 

 Mexico and Arizona was captured at all the desert localities visited in 

 southern New Mexico and at El Paso. In the vicinity of El Paso it 

 was taken, July 10, 11 and 17, on irrigated land along the Rio Grande 

 (1 cT, 3 9), at the edge of the mesa, (1 cT), in the greasewood belt 

 (1 9 ), in bare desert east of city (2 d\ 2 9 ), on desert hillside (2 d\ 

 1 9 ), on sand with a sparse growth of dry grass (17 d\ 8 9 ). At 

 Alamogordo a single male was attracted to light, July 12; three males 

 were collected in the rabbit-weed and mesquite plain around Deming, 

 July 18; one male and two females secured at Silver City, July 20, and 

 eight males and six females taken at Aden, July 21. 



In the irrigated tract near El Paso the species was fairly common on 

 the barer spots, usually in colonies, while at the foot of the mesa it was 

 not common on pieces of bare ground. At Aden the species was found 

 chiefly in grass prairie land, but in other situations as well, such as on 

 cinders along the railroad track where it was inactive until the sun had 

 warmed the ground, when the species became very active. 



The El Paso specimens from sand area with dry grass are the largest 

 of the species seen, a typical male and female measuring as follows : 



c? 9 



Length of body, 15.2 mm. 25.5 mm. 



Length of pronotum, 3 " 4.8" 



Length of tegmen, 17.5 " 24.5 " 



Length of caudal femur, 10.2 " 14.2 " 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 151 



The Silver City male and the three individuals of that sex from 

 Deming are quite small when compared with the El Paso series. 



The series from sand areas at El Paso is uniformly more ashy gray 

 than any other specimens of the species examined. The Aden series 

 is quite dark when compared with the El Paso representation, while 

 one female is strongly washed with rose red, particularly on the dorsum 

 of the pronotum where the pink color is almost pure. The remarks 

 previously made by the authors 16 regarding the variability of the color- 

 ation of the anal area of the tegmen and of the fuscous bar of the wings 

 in this species also apply to the series examined in this connection. 



This is the first record of the species from the State of Texas. 



TRIMEROTROPIS St&l. 



Trimerotropis texana (Brunei-). 



This interesting species was taken at all the purely Lower Sonoran 

 localities visited in southern New Mexico and extreme western Texas. 

 At El Paso it was found, July 10 and 11, rather sparingly in the broken 

 country at the foot of the mesa northeast of the city, on the bare spots 

 in the greasewood-covered mesa and in a dry stream bed in the irri- 

 gated section along the Rio Grande, six males and one female being 

 taken in the several situations. A single female was secured in the 

 street under an arc light the evening of July 12 at Alamogordo, while 

 one male was captured among greasewood at 4,900 feet elevation in Dry 

 Canyon, Sacramento Mountains, July 13. At Aden, July 21, in grass 

 prairie land and in dry grass, five males and three females were secured, 

 while a single male was taken at Lanark, Donna Ana County, New 

 Mexico, during a train stop on July 18. Three males and two females 

 were secured in the yucca-dotted sand waste along the Mimbres River, 

 north of Deming, July 18. This species was always found sparingly and 

 specimens were invariably collected singly. Although much slower of 

 flight than T. vinculata, this species has a peculiar habit of delaying its 

 flight until the net had passed over it, making it more difficult to 

 capture. Protective coloration appears to be a considerable factor 

 in the life of individuals of this species, its habitat being the barest 

 spots to be found in the region in which it occurs. 



There is considerable variation in size, even in specimens from the 

 same environment, and the coloration exhibits a tendency toward 

 predominating grayish-white tones in one direction and reddish- 

 ochraceous in the other. The specimen from Lanark is ochraceous- 

 buff in the general tone of all except the tegmina. The caudal angle 



16 Proc. Acad. Nat. Set. Phila., 1908, p. 388. 




152 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb. 



of the disk of the pronotum varies from acute to obtuse-angulate, 

 though by far the greater majority of the specimens have it rectangu- 

 late. 



Previously known only from El Paso, Texas; Mesilla, Mesilla Park 

 and the region about Las Graces, New Mexico, this species is now known 

 to range north in the Otero basin to at least as far as Alamogordo and 

 west at least to Deming. 



Trimerotropis fascicula McNeill. 



A pair of this species was taken at Albuquerque, September 14, 

 while a single male was secured on the greasewood-covered mesa north- 

 east of El Paso, July 10. The Albuquerque individuals were taken 

 on dry ground near the river bottom. The tegminal bars are well 

 defined in all three specimens. 

 Trimerotropis modesta Brunei-. 



A single freshly transformed female taken on the edge of the mesa 

 near El Paso, July 11, is referred tentatively to this species. On 

 account of its condition the wing membranes are quite delicate and 

 the coloration very weak, but it appears to represent this species, 

 although considerably larger than the original measurements and the 

 specimens available for comparison. 



Length of body, 30.5 mm. 



Length of pronotum, 7 " 



Length of tegmen, 34 " 



Length of caudal femur, 17 " 



Trimerotropis laticincta Saussure. 



Of this rather striking species a single female was taken, July 11, at 

 El Paso, and two males and one female at Deming, July 18. The 

 El Paso individual was collected on the rough slopes at the foot of 

 the mesa, while the Deming specimens were taken in the yucca-dotted 

 sand waste along the dry bed of the Mimbres. 



The wing-band in these specimens varies from a third to slightly 

 more than a third the length of the wing. The ulnar spur is very 

 short and sometimes hardly evident. The species is exceedingly 

 vigorous and wary. 

 Trimerotropis rubripes Rehn. 



This interesting species, previously known only from the unique 

 type from Albuquerque, is now known to range southward along the 

 Rio Grande Valley to El Paso and also eastward and westward over 

 a good portion of the Eastern or Chihuahuan Desert tract. Near El 

 Paso the species was found sparingly on bare patches among low weeds 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 153 



along the river bank in irrigated ground below the city. Here on July 

 10 and 11 four males and five females were taken. A single female 

 was taken under a street arc light at Alamogordo, July 12, while one 

 male was captured in grass prairie land at Aden, July 21. 



This series is quite uniform in size. While but little color variation 

 is noticeable, one female from El Paso is as reddish in general tone as 

 the type, but all the other specimens are more grayish. There is some 

 little variation in the intensity of the subobsolete tegminal bars, and 

 the wing band also appears more blackish than the type. 

 Trimerotropis vinculata Scudder. 



At every locality visited in New Mexico and around El Paso this 

 species was present. From an elevation of less than 1,000 feet at 

 Spofford, Texas, to 8,700 feet at Cloudcroft, every locality yielded 

 this form in greater or less abundance. The series of 112 specimens 

 is distributed as follows: Spofford, Texas, July 8, 1 9 ; near Pecos 

 High Bridge, Valverde County, Texas, July 8, 1 c? ; El Paso, July 10-11, 

 24 6\ 15 9 ; Franklin Mountains, July 9, 7 d\ 5 9 ; Alamogordo, July 

 12-13, 3 J 1 , 1 9 ; Cloudcroft, July 14, 15, 4 tf, 3 9 ; Aden, July 21, 

 27 &, 8 9 ; Deming, July 18, 1 9 ; Florida Mountains, July 19, 1 c?, 1 9 ; 

 Silver City, July 20, 3 d\ 1 9 ; Albuquerque, September 14, 4 d\ 2 9 . 



In the vicinity of El Paso, where the greatest variety of conditions 

 was encountered, the species was found on the greasewood-covered 

 mesa, the rugged slopes of the Franklin Mountains, the broken area 

 at the foot of the mesa and on bare spots in the irrigated region along 

 the Rio Grande. At Deming the mesquite and rabbit-weed plain 

 harbored this species, while in the Florida Mountains it occurred on 

 the rugged lower slopes. At Cloudcroft it was found uncommon in 

 meadow land and along the edge of the conifer forest, while at Alamo- 

 gordo it was found in the greasewood area east of the town and 

 around arc lights at night. Cultivated ground was frequented at 

 Albuquerque and rugged hillsides at Silver City, while all situations 

 yielded it at Aden. 



The majority of the El Paso specimens are slightly more grayish 

 than the others in the series examined, the contrast of the tegminal 

 bars being more decided, although this latter feature is so variable as 

 to be worth nothing more than passing notice. 

 Trimerotropis cyaneipennis Brunei-. 



On the very steep rocky slopes of the Florida Mountains this species 

 occurred sparingly, two specimens, a male and female, being taken. 

 It haunted the same jumble of boulders and precipitous exposures as 

 Mestobregma plattei and was equally wary and vigorous. The male 




154 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



has the tegminal bars strongly marked, much as found in individuals 

 of that sex from the Huachuca Mountains, while the female is paler, 

 but is similar to a specimen of that sex from the latter locality. A 

 single female of this species was also taken on Grand View Point at 

 Cloudcroft, July 16, while an individual of the same sex from Fort 

 Wingate, New Mexico, taken August 16 by John Woodgate, has also 

 been examined. The disk of the wing is very pale greenish-blue in 

 the Cloudcroft male, glaucous blue in the Florida Mountains male, 

 campanula blue in the Florida Mountains female. 



This species is now known to occur in suitable surroundings in New 

 Mexico, in the Organ Mountains at about 5,700 feet, at 8,000 feet in the 

 White Mountains, at 5,400 feet in the Florida Mountains; in Arizona at 

 Flagstaff, in the Grand Canyon from 3,000 to 7,000, in Oak Creek 

 Canyon, at Prescott and in the Huachuca range. 



CIRCOTETTIX Scudder. 

 Circotettix undulatus (Thomas). 



It is very hard to understand Bruner's statement 17 that "this locust 

 is partial to bare, more or less alkaline ground, and for that reason is 

 found throughout the more arid regions wherever suitable localities 

 occur." Our experience with the species in Colorado, New Mexico 

 and Arizona shows its range to be chiefly in the Transition, Canadian 

 and Hudsonian zones, by no means in the "more arid" regions, fre- 

 quenting often "slashings" or cut areas in the forest region still covered 

 with the debris left by the lumberman. Here it delights in performing- 

 its interesting aerial dance, ascending as much as seventy feet in the 

 air, and hovering there for some minutes, keeping up its continual 

 clatter. Open hillsides in the park-like glade region of the higher 

 ranges are much frequented by these insects, and when the sun has 

 warmed them after the chill of the night they proceed with their regular 

 clattering music. 



At Cloudcroft, on July 14 and 15, this species was found numerous 

 in several situations, the greatest number being taken on the hillside 

 of James Canyon, where quite a colony was located and where their 

 clatter was continuous. In all a series of ten males and eleven females 

 was taken, comparatively little difference in size being exhibited by 

 the sexes, although in color the males are more blackish than the 

 females. 



It is interesting to note that when a series of forty-nine specimens 

 from Cloudcroft and Beulah, New Mexico, is compared with one of 



17 Biol. Cent.-Amer., Orth., II, p. 183. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 155 



seventeen from the Grand Canyon region, the New Mexican series is 

 seen to have the caudal angle of the disk of the pronotum more acute 

 in both sexes. 



HADROTETTIX Scudder. 

 Hadrotettix trifasciatus (Say). 



A single male of this species was secured on a rugged hillside near 

 Silver City, July 20. It is a very small specimen. 



ANCONIA Scudder. 

 Anoonia caeruleipennis Bruner. 



This most interesting species, which" was described from a single 

 female from Hawthorne, Nevada, is represented by two males and 

 seven females from the vicinity of El Paso. When compared with the 

 brief original description of the species the specimens agree fully, and 

 as a series show no differences worth noting, except a lightening or 

 darkening of the cinereous base color. 



One of the rather striking features of this species is the subinnated 

 disk of the prozona and metazona, while the principal sulcus is deeply 

 impressed and the median carina elevated or subtectate on the cephalic 

 portion of the prozona. The ease with which this species in life loses 

 its caudal limbs is remarkable. 



Two females were taken on the mesa at the east base of the south 

 peak of the Franklin Mountains, July 9; one male and two females 

 were taken along the edge of the mesa, July 11; while one male and 

 three females were secured in the irrigated section along the Rio Grande 

 on the same date. 



HELIASTUS Saussure. 

 Heliastus aridus (Bruner). 



This characteristic desert species was taken at El Paso, Alamogordo, 

 Silver City and Deming, in all of which localities it was found on rocky 

 areas or bare spots between the greasewood or mesquite bushes. At 

 El Paso, July 9-11, it was taken on the mesa, the broken edge of the 

 mesa and on the slopes of the Franklin Mountains, a series of fifteen 

 males and fourteen females being collected. Three males were secured 

 in suitable surroundings in the mesquite and rabbit-weed plain at 

 Deming, July 18; a pair at Alamogordo, July 13, in the greasewood belt, 

 and an immature female at Silver City, July 20. 



The Deming individuals have hoary white very prominent in their 

 coloration, while several of the El Paso series have a strong bluish-gray 

 tendency.

PHRYNOTETTIX Glover. 

 Phrynotettix verruculatus Uhler. 



A single female which was taken on a bare spot of red earth in grass 

 prairie land at Aden, July 21, belongs to this species. The coloration 

 of the specimen resembles that of the surroundings in which it was 

 taken. The specimen measures as follows : Length of body, 35 mm. ; 

 length of pronotum, 16; greatest dorsal width of pronotum, 11 ; exposed 

 length of tegmen, 7; length of caudal femur, 16. One of the charac- 

 ters separating this species from P. magnus (Thomas) from southern 

 Arizona is the more compressed and deeply sulcate inter-antennal 

 portion of the frontal costa. 



The records of this species are from the Pecos River in Texas or New 

 Mexico; Las Cruces, La Cueva, Organ Mountains, Taos Valley and 

 Aden, New Mexico, and Phoenix, Arizona. 

 Phrynotettix robustus (Brunei-). 



A single female of this species was collected on the summit of a boul- 

 der-covered hill at the foot of the mesa at El Paso, July 11. The 

 specimen was squatted motionless on a large pebble like a toad. 



This species is now known from localities in the Otero Basin 

 (Alamogordo), Rio Grande Valley (El Paso, Las Cruces and Lake 

 Valley) and Southwestern Arizona. 



SCHISTOCERCA St&l. 

 Schistocerca alutacea (Harris). 



A single female from Albuquerque, taken September 14 in the culti- 

 vated section along the Rio Grande, is referred to this species. It 

 has the caudal tibiae extremely dark and in this respect it approaches 

 S. obscura, but on comparison with specimens of S. alutacea, obscura 

 and venusta its most intimate relationship is seen to be with alutacea. 

 The metazona is well supplied with fair-sized spots of yellowish, similar 

 to those frequently noticed in S. venusta and more rarely in a weaker 

 form in S. alutacea. 



The previous New Mexican records of this species are from Las Cruces 

 and the vicinity of Mesilla, its known distribution in the territory being 

 in the bottom lands of a portion of the Rio Grande Valley. 



Schistoceroa shoshone (Thomas). 



This powerful species was found at both El Paso and Albuquerque, 

 two males and two females being taken at the former locality and four 

 males and two females at the latter. At Albuquerque, September 14, 

 the species was taken in the cultivated area along the river, while at 

 El Paso one pair was taken from tall green weeds on irrigated land, 

 July 11, and the other pair was captured, July 17, in the mesquite- 

 dotted sand waste east of the town, in which latter situation the species 

 was plentiful but very wary.

 black tips. 



Measurements. 



Length of body, 20 mm. 



Length of pronotum, 4.8 " 



Length of tegmen, 9 " 



Length of caudal femur, 12 " 



The type is the only specimen of this beautiful species seen by us, 

 and was taken from a mesquite which had recently been drenched by 

 heavy rain. No time was available for further search, as our stay 

 w r as limited to a brief train stop. 



HESPEROTETTIX Scudder. 

 Hesperotettix viridis (Thomas). 



Of this beautiful species a series of seventy specimens is contained 

 in the collection, of which fifty-three are males, twenty-two females 

 and five immature individuals. The fondness of this species for the 

 patches and larger areas of rabbit weed (Isocoma heterophylla) is very 

 marked, and it usually occurs in abundance where that plant is present. 

 Often in patches of this plant one would notice several specimens of this 

 species sitting on the summit of a single clump. 



At Deming it was very abundant on its food-plant on both sides of 

 the dry bed of the Mimbres, a series of forty-five males, eighteen females 

 and four nymphs being taken July 18. It also occurred in great num- 

 bers in suitable locations between the town and the Florida Mountains, 

 while at 5,000 feet in a canyon in the Florida range it was very scarce, 

 one male and two females being taken. At El Paso it was taken in the 

 low country along the Rio Grande, four males and two females being 

 secured on July 11. On the usual food-plant at Aden, July 21, one 

 male and one female were taken, while one adult male and one nymph 

 were collected at Silver City, July 20. 



Of this large series thirty show no distinct blackish markings on or 




160 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



in the transverse sulci of the dorsum of the pronotum, although these 

 are strongly pencilled in others. Of the Deming series of sixty-three 

 adults twenty-three are without the blackish pencilling. The Deming 

 series also contains one specimen in a brownish phase, while four others 

 from the same locality approach it more or less closely. The red pre- 

 genicular annulus is present in every adult in the series, in by far the 

 majority of the specimens very strongly indicated. 



There is a considerable amount of individual variation in size, even 

 in specimens from the same immediate locality, but even the largest 

 specimens do not approach the robust, closely allied Mexican H. 

 meridionalis. Several specimens from eastern Colorado (Lamar, 

 Holly and Greeley), examined in connection with the New Mexican 

 material, have the caudal femora very robust. 



JEOLOPLUS Scudder. 

 iEoloplus elegans Scudder. 



This variable species, which at present is only known from localities 

 in the Rio Grande Valley, was taken in numbers at El Paso, July 10, 

 11 and 17. It was found in greatest abundance in bottom land along 

 the river, where it frequented the screw bean or tornillo (Prosopis 

 odorata) and adjacent weedy areas, a series of sixteen males and nine 

 females being taken. Along the edge of the mesa a single pair was 

 taken, while the mesquite-covered sand desert east of the town furnished 

 four males and one female. 



In size there is a considerable amount of variation, so much so in 

 fact that at first glance at a number of males of the species one would 

 imagine they had two forms before them. This variation does not 

 appear to be correlated with any particular environment or with the 

 color phase of the individual. The extremes of the series measure as 

 follows : 



Length of body . 13.2 mm. 20 mm. 19.2 mm. 19. 8 20 mm. 



Length of pronotum, 3.5 " 5 " 5 " 5.2 " 



Length of tegmen, .13 " 17.2 " 16.8 " 17.6 " 

 Length of caudal 



femur, ... 9 " 12 " 11.8 " 13.2 " 



As shown by the above measurements the greatest amount of varia- 

 tion is exhibited by the male, although that noticed in the female is 

 quite perceptible. 



The form of the male cerci is rather variable, in many specimens these

appendages being slenderer and not as robust distad as figured by 

 Scudder, although the general form remains essentially the same. 

 There is also a slight variation in the shape of the tubercle of the sub- 

 genital plate. 



In color, as pointed out by Scudder and Cockerell, 21 there is pro- 

 nounced variation, although its description may be simplified by con- 

 sidering the green form one extreme and the full brownish and ochre 

 form the other, leaving numerous specimens as intermediates between 

 the two. The full green phase, having all the dark markings green 

 and the lighter ones yellowish-green, is represented in our material 

 by five males and one female, although closely approached by five 

 other females. The full brown phase is represented by six males and 

 one female, the remainder of the series being intermediate in coloration. 

 The green phase was noticed chiefly among tall green weeds, while 

 the brown phase was usually found in much fewer numbers upon the 

 tornillo or screw bean. The tegmina are distinctly though not sharply 

 maculate in eight specimens and unicolorous in six, the remainder 

 having the anal vein marked more or less completely with a pale line. 

 There is also a considerable amount of variation in the depth of the 

 glaucous color of the caudal tibiae. 



The species has been recorded from Las Cruces and Mesilla Park, 

 Donna Ana County, New Mexico. 



MELANOPLUS Still. 

 Melanoplus bowditohi Scudder. 



This species is represented in the collection by three males and eight 

 females, taken as follows: El Paso, July 10 and 17 (1 d\ 2 9); 

 Aden, July 21 (1 d\ 4 9 ) ; Albuquerque, September 14(19) ; Deming, 

 July 18 (1 d\ 1 9 ). At El Paso it was taken at the edge of the grease- 

 wood-covered mesa and from mesquite growing in the sandhill country 

 east of the city. It frequented cultivated ground at Albuquerque, was 

 taken in grass prairie land at Aden and frequented the mesquite and 

 rabbit-weed plain at Deming. 



In actions the species is extremely vigorous and alert, usually making 

 long flights. But one of the specimens approaches anyway closely the 

 type of coloration seen in individuals of the species from eastern Colo- 

 rado and southwestern Nebraska, this individual being from mesquite 

 at El Paso. The majority of the series are duller with umber browns 

 the predominating colors, the postocular bar not strongly marked in 

 two specimens and nearly obsolete in one. The bars on the dorsum

of the caudal femora are more or less distinct in all but one individual 

 which has them obsolete. 



In size the specimens are decidedly larger than individuals from 

 Colorado and Nebraska, as the following measurements show: 



The previous records of this species from New Mexico are from 

 Belen, Valencia County, Sabinal, Socorro County, Las Cruces, Donna 

 Ana County and Chaves, McKinley County. 



Melanoplus herbaceus Bruner. 



This variable species is represented by a series of forty-nine males 

 and thirty-three females taken at El Paso, Albuquerque and Alamo- 

 gordo. At El Paso it was found in a variety of habitats : on greasewood 

 on the slopes of the Franklin Mountains (July 9, 1 d\ 2 9 ), on grease- 

 wood on the mesa and at the edge of the same (July 10 and 11, 4 d\ 

 1 9 ), on mesquite growing on the sandhills east of the city (July 17, 

 4 d\ 2 9 ), and on irrigated land along the Rio Grande below the city 

 (July 10 and 11, 38 d\ 25 9 ). In the sandhill region the species was 

 very wary and usually flew into the most inaccessible portions of the 

 thickets of mesquite, while along the river it was plentiful but equally 

 hard to capture. Two males and two females were secured in culti- 

 vated land at Albuquerque, September 14, while a single female was 

 attracted to light at Alamogordo, July 12. 



In size there is a considerable amount of individual variation, as 

 the following measurements of extremes of the series from along the 

 Rio Grande at El Paso will show: 



d 1 



c? 



The structure of the male cerci and of the furcula exhibits a con- 

 siderable amount of variation in this species, about half of the males 

 examined showing at least some slight approach to the form called 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 163 



flavescens by Scudder. A number of specimens are typical of flaves- 

 cens as far as the cerci and furcula are concerned, but a careful study 

 of this large series of eighty-one specimens shows that the slight genital 

 characters and the color of the tips of the antennae, of the pronotum 

 and of the caudal tibiae, given specific importance by Scudder to separ- 

 ate M. herbaceus and flavescens, are by no means specific and can be 

 considered only individual, the extremes being connected by a number 

 of intermediates. 



In color we find two quite distinct extremes connected by inter- 

 mediates, one extreme being uniform light green with the postocular 

 bar subobsolete or entirely lacking, the other various shades of brown, 

 touched with yellowish around the head and along the ventral border 

 of the postocular bar which is quite distinct. Numerous intermediates 

 show the postocular bar distinct with green the general color, others 

 with yellowish and yellowish-brown the general color. The antennae 

 are usually not infuscate at the tips in the green phase, the majority 

 of the other specimens having a more or less distinct apical inf uscation. 

 The caudal tibiae are generally some shade of glaucous, varying con- 

 siderably in depth, but a few specimens have a decided greenish tone 

 to these parts. 



The species has previously been recorded from El Paso, Texas, and 

 Las Cruces, Mesilla Park and Albuquerque, New Mexico, while Scudder 

 and Cockerell have assigned specimens from Mesilla and Mesilla Park 

 to M. flavescens. 



Melanoplus glauoipes (Scudder). 



At El Paso this peculiar species was found in small numbers in 

 thickets of screw bean or tornillo growing in the low river-land, where 

 on July 10 one male and three females were taken. Two females were 

 also secured on July 10 and 11 from mesquite, while one male and three 

 females were taken, July 17, from mesquite thickets in the sand region 

 east of the city. A single female was taken at Clin, Uvalde County, 

 Texas, July 8, in a damp weedy location. The species is a vigorous 

 one and at El Paso it was extremely difficult to capture, owing to its 

 habit of seeking shelter by retiring to the thickest portion of the 

 mesquite or tornillo bush on which it was found. In such surroundings 

 a net was useless and work with the hands paid a penalty of thorn 

 stabs sufficient to deter any but an enthusiast. It was impossible to 

 flush specimens into the open, as the insects merely shifted their position 

 to another portion of the bush. 



There is a considerable amount of variation in the shade of the 

 dorsum of the head, pronotum and anal area of the tegmina, face, 




164 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



gense and ventral portion of the lateral lobe of the pronotum, and of 

 the caudal femora; these portions being pale ochraceous in one speci- 

 men, very dull ochraceous in several others and warm red brown in 

 another. The majority have these areas umber-brown. The red- 

 brown specimen is from Clin and all the ochraceous individuals from 

 the sandhill country. 



The previous records of this species are from Dallas and Bonita, 

 Texas; Mountain Park, Oklahoma: Mesilla Park, New Mexico, and 

 Lerdo, Durango, Mexico. 



Melanoplus atlanis (Riley). 



Three males and two females of this widely spread species were 

 taken in weedy spots in irrigated land along the Rio Grande below 

 El Paso on July 10 and 11. A single male was taken on July 14 at 

 Wootens, Otero County, New Mexico, at an elevation of about 7,000 

 feet, while a series of six females was taken in meadow-land at Cloud- 

 croft, July 14-15. 



As previously noticed by the authors 22 in regard to Arizona material 

 of this species, the series before us show uniformly greater size than 

 is true of specimens from the eastern United States, agreeing with 

 material from Colorado and northern New Mexico, in addition to that 

 previously recorded from Arizona. 



Melanoplus aridus (Scudder). 



This interesting species, which has a very considerable vertical range, 

 is represented by five males and one female taken at El Paso (July 11, 

 1 cT), in Dry Canyon, Sacramento Mountains (July 13, 1 cT), Florida 

 Mountains (July 19, 2 cT, 1 9) and at Albuquerque (September 14, 

 1 d 1 ). A pair of this species from Fort Wingate, New Mexico, taken 

 August 28 by John Woodgate, have also been examined. 



At Albuquerque the species was taken on river bottom-land, at El 

 Paso on weeds in field along river bank, while in Dry Canyon and 

 in the Florida Mountains at elevations from 5,000 to 5,500 feet in 

 the juniper and pinon zone, the species occurred among bush oaks 

 (Florida Mountains) and on mesquite (Dry Canyon). In both of the 

 latter situations adults of the species were very scarce, but a number 

 of immature specimens, presumably of this species, were noticed. 



The male from El Paso is larger and lighter in color than the other 

 specimens of that sex, while the Albuquerque individual is very dark 

 in color. The latter specimen resembles closely in general color tone 



22 Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1908, p. 396. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 165 



representatives of the species from northern Arizona. This is the first 

 record of the species from Texas. 



Melanoplus altitudinum (Scudder). 23 



Two females of this species were collected in James Canyon, Cloud- 

 croft, July 14-15, one being from the overgrown slope of the canyon, 

 the other from a weedy spot at the mouth of the canyon. The indi- 

 vidual from the slope of the canyon is somewhat smaller than the other 

 specimen. 



The previous New Mexican records of the species are from northern 

 New Mexico (Scudder), Taos Peak, 13,000 feet (Scudder), ridge between 

 Sapello and upper Pecos River (Scudder, Cockerell) and Cloudcroft 

 (Rehn). 

 Melanoplus feuiur-rubrum (De Geer). 



A series of seven males and seven females of this widely distributed 

 species were taken in cultivated ground at Albuquerque, September 

 14, a single male also being collected at El Paso, July 11, in bottom- 

 land along the Rio Grande. 



Melanoplus calidus Scudder. 



One of the most characteristic grasshoppers of the mountain meadows 

 and of underbrush in certain portions of the forest-land around Cloud- 

 croft is this striking species. Scudder originally described this 

 insect from Oilman's Ranch, Eagle Creek, White Mountains, New 

 Mexico, at an elevation of 7,000 feet; Scudder and Cockerell later 

 recording it from the South Fork of Eagle Creek. 



The species was found to be plentiful on July 

 14 and 15, although in the morning before ten 

 o'clock it was very hard to find. The series 

 taken consists of twenty-nine males and twenty 



femaleS - . Fig. 15. -Melano-

sex and but little variation in the female, and then Scudder. Dorsal

with Scudder's measurements the specimens are

23 The great difficulty of separating some of the brachypterous species of 

 Melanoplus from representatives of the genus Podisma and the close resemblance 

 existing between Melanoplus altitudinum and Podisma dodgei was responsible 

 for an erroneous determination made by the senior author (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. 

 Phila., 1904, p. 571). The specimens from Raton, New Mexico, and Prescottand 

 Copper Basin, Arizona, there referred to M. altitudinum, are really Podisma dodgei, 

 as a careful re-examination of all the available material in the two species shows. 

 A series of Coloradan P. dodgei and Wyoming and New Mexican M . altitudinum 

 have been used for comparison.

The great length of the body in the last measured specimen is 

 in part at least due to distension. The tegmina are quite uniform 



in the males, while in the females 6.3 mm. is the 

 greatest length found. The caudal margin of 

 the pronotum is subtruncate in a few individuals, 

 and very slightly and broadly obtuse-angulate in 

 the great majority. In color the general tone varies 

 from gray-brown to umber-brown, but the pattern 

 varies but little, while the pale yellowish stripe 

 is more marked in some specimens than in others. 

 This species is apparently very close to M. 

 quadratus Scudder from South Fork of Eagle 

 Creek, 8,100 feet, White Mountains, New Mexico; at least the two 

 descriptions are veiy similar and specimens are determined with con- 

 siderable difficulty. 



Melanoplus differentialis (Thomas). 



This destructive species was found swarming on irrigated land along 

 the Rio Grande below El Paso, July 11, two males being taken, while 

 at Albuquerque it was found plentiful in high weeds on cultivated 

 land on September 14, a pair being collected. 



Melanoplus bivittatus (Say). 



A series of five males and eight females was taken in the bottom- 

 land at Albuquerque on September 14. The caudal tibiae are quite 

 black proximad in a number of individuals and some shade of glaucous 

 distad in all but three specimens, which are more or less strongly 

 yellowish on that portion of the tibise. The dark line on the dorsal 

 portion of the lateral face of the caudal femora is distinctly marked 

 in all the individuals. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 167 



TETTIGONID^J. 

 DICHOPETALA Brunner. 

 Dichopetala brevihastata Scudder. 



A single immature male taken on greasewood at an elevation of 

 4,800 feet at the mouth of Dry Canyon, Sacramento Mountains, appears 

 to belong to this species, although the identification is attended with 

 a little uncertainty owing to the immaturity of the specimen. Imma- 

 ture specimens apparently of this species were found to be fairly com- 

 mon when beating in the vicinity of the mouth of the canyon. 



HORMILIA Stal. 

 Hormilia elegans Scudder. 



Two females of this species were taken at Deming, July 20, both 

 attracted to light. One specimen of the species was found in the 

 lunch-room of the railroad station and brought to us by one of the 

 waiters. 



On comparing these specimens with the original measurements and 



with seven individuals from Florence, Arizona, it became apparent 



that specimens from the eastern side of the continental divide were 



larger than representatives from the western side. The following 



measurements may be of use when more extensive series are examined.

One of the Deming females is a very pale buff, with the "herring- 

 bone" tegminal pattern but faintly marked. The other individual is 

 in the green phase with the pattern a pale green, and no indication of 

 the blackish suffusion on the sutural areas frequently seen in the 

 species. 



The previous New Mexican records for the species were all from the 

 vicinity of Las Cruces and Mesilla in the Mesilla Valley. 



ARETHiEA Stal. 

 Arethaea oonstricta Brunner. 



A single male of this species was taken at Fort Wingate, New Mexico, 

 August 28, 1908. by John Woodgate. 



The species has been recorded from Texas; near Organ Mountains, 

 New Mexico; from an arroyo ten miles west of La Luz, Otero County, 

 New Mexico; Tucson and Baboquivari Mountains, Arizona, 



SCUDDEEIA Stal. 

 Soudderia furcifera Scudder. 



A single female of this species has been examined from Fort Wingate, 

 New Mexico, taken August 23, 1908, by John Woodgate. 



The only previous New Mexican records of this species were from the 

 southern portion of the Territory, La Cueva, Organ Mountains, and 

 Dripping Springs, Organ Mountains. 



AMBLYCORYPHA St&l. 

 Amblycorypha huasteca (Saussure). 



A single male of this species was beaten from a tall green bush grow- 

 ing in the bottom of Dry Canyon, Sacramento Mountains, at an 

 elevation of 5,200 feet, in the pinon and juniper zone. 



This specimen is of considerable interest, as when compared with a 

 series of eight males and two females from Shovel Mount, Burnet 

 County, Texas, the tegmina are found to be appreciably longer, 

 although the body and caudal femora are of about the same size. 

 The dimensions of the Dry Canyon speecimen compared with an 

 average Shovel Mount male and the original measurements of Saussure 

 are as follows : 



Length of body, 

 Length of pronotum, 



Length of tegmen, 

 Greatest width of tegmen 

 Length of caudal femur, 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 169 



A sufficient series of the longer winged form may show the necessity 

 of recognizing it as a geographic race. 



This is the first record of the species from New Mexico and one of 

 the few from west of Texas. The senior author has recorded it from 

 southern Arizona, and Snow has credited it to Oak Creek Canyon, 

 Coconino County, Arizona, 



EREMOPEDES Cockerell. 

 Eremopedes albofasciata Scudder and Cockerell. 



Four immature specimens, two of each sex, were taken at Aden, 

 July 21, in grass prairie land; a single immature female from Deming, 

 July 18, taken On rabbit weed, is also in the collection. The only 

 previous record of the species was that of the type from Mesilla Park. 



ATELOPLUS Scudder. 

 Ateloplus macroscelus'- 4 a. sp. 



Type : 9 ; El Paso, El Paso County, Texas. July 1 1 , 1907. (Hebar'd

Allied to A. notatus Scudder and A. schwarzi Caudell, but differing 

 from both in the much more elongate caudal limbs and ovipositor and 

 the different color pattern. 



Size medium; form moderately elongate. Head quite short but 

 rather broad and deep; fastigium of the vertex rounding to the facial 

 fastigium which it touches, surface of the same not appreciably sulcate ; 

 eyes not prominent, subovate in outline; antennas slightly more than 

 twice the length of the bod}', proximal joint rather large, slightly 

 produced on the internal face. Pronotum with its dorsal length slightly 

 more than twice that of the exposed dorsum of the head, the dorsum 

 of the pronotum regularly arcuate in transverse section rounding into 

 the lateral lobes; cephalic margin of the dorsum subtruncate. caudal 

 margin very broadly and shallowly but distinctly obtuse-angulate 

 emarginate; when seen from the side the dorsal line of the pronotum 

 is nearly straight, no sellate tendency being present; lateral lobes 

 of the pronotum very considerably longer than deep, the ventral margin 

 obtuse-angulate with the caudal portion of the angle slightly arcuate- 

 emarginate. Tegmina present as the merest pads, hardly visible 

 caudad of the pronotal margin. Prosternal processes the merest 

 obtuse-angulate shoulders, in no sense spines. Abdomen with a 

 very blunt dorsal carina; terminal dorsal abdominal segment with 

 a considerable median impression which is folded ventrad; cerci 

 short, conical, acute; ovipositor about three-fourths the length of the 



24 Ma/cpoorce/l^?, having long legs.

caudal femora, moderately robust, somewhat arcuate proximad and 

 distad, nearly straight in the middle, the proximal third more robust 

 than the remainder, the apex acute; subgenital plate obtuse-angulate 

 with a rather large and quite deep median V-shaped emargination, a 

 pair of moderately distinct sub-parallel longitudinal carina? present 

 on the plate. Cephalic and median limbs of moderate length ; cephalic 

 femora equal to the pronotum in length, unarmed; cephalic tibiae 

 armed dorsad with three spines on the outer margin, with six on each 

 of the ventral ones ; median femora very slightly longer than the cepha- 

 lic, unarmed; median tibia? with the dorsal margins armed with two 

 (cephalic) or four (caudal) spines, each of the ventrals with six spines. 

 Caudal femora slightly longer than the body, moderately inflated in 



Fig. 17. 



-Ateloplus macroscelus n. sp. Lateral view of type, (x 2.) 



the proximal half, slender distad, the greatest width contained nearly 

 six times in the length, externo-ventral margin with a single spine, 

 interno- ventral with five; caudal tibiae about equal to the femora in 

 length, all the margins spined, the dorsal ones with a number con- 

 siderably exceeding that of the ventral series. 



General colors cream white and blackish-brown, generally mingled 

 and marbled, with but little pattern aside from several rather darker 

 longitudinal areas on the abdomen and a median obsolete V-shaped 

 figure on the pronotum. The ventral portion of the lateral lobes of 

 the pronotum is pure cream-white divided sharply but irregularly from 

 the darker dorsal section. On the face, the pleura and the sides of 

 the proximal portion of the abdomen the lighter color predominates 

 or is more conspicuous on account of the marbling being coarser. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 171 



Limbs marbled as is the case with the body, but a tendency toward 

 broad annuli is noticed; caudal limbs with considerable blue-gray 

 present in place of blackish-brown. Eyes wood-brown clouded with 

 burnt umber; antennse, except for the proximal joint, vandyke brown; 

 ovipositor with the general pattern. 



Measurements. 



Length of body, 21 mm. 



Length of pronotum, 6.8 " 



Length of caudal femur, 25 " 



Length of ovipositor, 18 " 



The type and an immature paratypic female (July 10) were taken 

 on greasewood on the mesa to the south and east of the Franklin 

 Mountains. 



STENOPELMATUS Burmeister. 

 Stenopelmatus oculatus Scudder. 



A single female of this species from Fort Wingate, New Mexico, 

 taken October 15, 1907, by John Woodgate, has been examined. 



CEUTHOPHILUS Scudder. 

 Ceuthophilus uniformis Scudder. 



Three females of this species were taken at Cloudcroft on July 14, 

 under the bark of a stump of yellow pine (Pinus ponderosa). The only 

 previous New Mexican records of the species are from Beulah, San 

 Miguel County, and plains of northern New Mexico, eastern slope. 

 Elsewhere the species is found in Colorado, western Nebraska and 

 eastern Kansas. 



Ceuthophilus valgus Scudder. 



A single male of this very interesting species was taken from the 

 interior of a decayed log of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga mucronata). 

 This individual is slightly larger than Scudder's original measurements 

 and considerably larger than an individual from Beulah, New Mexico. 



The species has been recorded from Santa Fe, Beulah and White 

 Mountain region, New Mexico, and also from certain localities in Colo- 

 rado. 



Ceuthophilus pauoispinosus Rehn. 



Two females of this species were taken in the Florida Mountains 

 in November by Dr. H. A. Pilsbry. The specimens are of average 

 size and do not differ from individuals from the Huachuca Mountains, 

 Arizona. This is the first record of the species from New r Mexico, the 




172 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



previous records being from the Huachuca Mountains and Oak Creek 

 Canyon, Arizona, and without exact data from the southern portion 

 of the same Territory. 



UDEOPSYLLA. Soudder. 

 Udeopsylla socorrensis (Rehn). 



This species, which was described as a species of Phrixocnemis , 

 should be placed in the genus Udeopsylla , probably with U. franciscanus 

 and vierecki representing a new subgenus. The structure and arma- 

 ment of the caudal tibiae are quite different from the type found in 

 U. robusta, but with the small amount of material available it seems 

 best to defer any division until an opportunity to examine a more 

 extensive series presents itself. A single male of this species from 

 Fort Wingate, collected May 12, 190S, by John Woodgate, has been 

 examined. The only previous record for the species is that of the types 

 from the Magdalena Mountains, New Mexico. 



GRYLLIDiE. 

 ECTATODERUS Guerin. 

 Eotatoderus borealis Scudder. 



A single nearly mature female of this species was taken from a dead 

 yucca on the greasewood slope between Alain ogordo and Dry Canyon. 

 July 13. Two adult females taken in the Florida Mountains in Novem- 

 ber by Dr. H. A. Pilsbry have also been examined, as well as a male 

 from Claremont, California, taken by Prof. C. F. Baker. 



The Alamogordo specimen has the lateral lobes of the pronotum 

 quite blackish, but this is not the case with the Florida Mountain 

 females, although present in the Claremont male. Its absence may 

 be due to the fact that the specimens in which this coloration is absent 

 were collected in alcohol. 



The previous New Mexican records of this species were from La 

 Cueva and Dripping Springs, Organ Mountains. 



NEMOBIUS Scudder. 

 Nemobius neomexicanus Scudder. 



Three specimens of this species, one adult male, one adult female 

 and one immature individual, were taken at Alamogordo, July 16, in 

 long grass under cottonwoods in the irrigated town park, where the 

 species was abundant. 



Both of the adults have the wings shorter than the tegmina, but- 

 otherwise they fully agree with an individual from Florence, Arizona. 



The species has been recorded from Las Cruces and Mesilla, New 




1909.] 



NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



173 



Mexico; Douglas. Cochise County, and Florence, Pinal County, Arizona; 

 Los Angeles, California, and several localities in Lower California. 

 Nemobius utahensis Seudder. 



A single female of this species, previously known only from Spring 

 Lake and Salt Lake Valley, Utah, and Sedalia and Montevista, Colo- 

 rado, was taken at Albuquerque, September 14, where the species was 

 common in heavy weeds in the bottom-land. The capture of the 

 species at Montevista, Colorado, is interesting when taken with the 

 Albuquerque record, as the former locality is in the upper portion of 

 the Rio Grande valley. 



GRYLLUS Linnaeus. 

 Gryllus personatus Uhler.

Gryllus alogus Rehn. 



A series of nine males and six females are contained in the collec- 

 tions examined in this connection. Of this series five males and three 

 females were taken at Alamogordo, July 12 and 13, one male attracted 

 to light, the remainder taken from a dead yucca ; one pair was taken at 

 El Paso, July 11, from a burrow, also inhabited by immature gryllids of 

 other species, at the edge of the mesa; two males and one female from 

 desert hillside and grass prairie at Aden, July 21 ; a single male from 

 Deming, July 19, attracted to light, and a single female from Fort 

 Wingate, May 12, collected by John Woodgate. 



The Fort Wingate individual is quite small, no more than two-thirds 

 the size of the other females, while the coloration of nearly all the speci- 

 mens is uniformly darker than that of the type. The species appears 

 to be closely related to the Californian G. vocalis.

MICROSCOPICAL IMAGE FORMATION. 

 BY F. J. KEELEY. 



This subject is of importance to every user of a microscope, as a 

 correct understanding of the optical laws which govern the formation 

 of the image would assist in determining to what extent the true 

 structure and size of the object under examination is correctly repre- 

 sented by the appearances presented to the eye. We are confronted 

 with two radically different theories of microscopical vision, which may 

 be termed the diffraction and dioptric theories, although the former 

 requires the presence of both diffracted and dioptric beams, while the 

 latter deals principally with the effect of diffraction, but only such as 

 arises in the instrument itself and not from the object under exami- 

 nation. As the exponents of each seem to take partisan views and fail 

 to give adequate consideration to the opposing theory, it appeared to 

 be worth while to make a careful study of both in as far as possible 

 an unprejudiced manner, supplemented by experiments, with the 

 view of endeavoring to learn whether they are wholly irreconcilable. 



From 1771, when Benjamin Martin applied a low power achromatic 

 objective to a microscope and explained that its superiority was largely 

 due to the increased aperture available, until Tolles, a century later, 

 realized the possibility and practicability of producing objectives with 

 apertures in excess of the equivalent of 180° in air, the principal efforts 

 of the opticians and their collaborators, the microscopists, was in the 

 direction of increased aperture and improved chromatic corrections, and 

 no serious doubts appear to have been raised regarding the dioptric 

 theory, in the form in which it had been worked out for the telescope; 

 but when the practical limit of aperture with available materials had been 

 reached by all the leading opticians, more attention was paid to theoret- 

 ical questions, and it began to be apparent that there were certain phe- 

 nomena connected with image formation in the microscope which could 

 not be satisfactorily explained by accepted theories. Abbe investigated 

 this problem with characteristic acumen and evolved the theory which 

 has since borne his name, and although immediately attacked and 

 later somewhat modified by himself, although in a radical direction, 

 12 




178 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [March, 



his theory has stood unrefuted up to the present time; but recently 

 there has been a feeling aroused that, without further modification, 

 it fails to fully account for all features of observed microscopical 

 images. 



The old dioptric theory has accordingly been re-expounded and 

 amplified, and it is unnecessary to explain it in detail, as this has been 

 most admirably and completely done in Wright's "Principles of 

 Microscopy," published in 1906, which, while characterized by inac- 

 curacies in connection with such matters as the measurement of focus 

 and aperture, and indicating a lack of acquaintance with the diffrac- 

 tion theory, covers the ground from the dioptric point of view so tho- 

 roughly that I find but one point open to criticism, which is the employ- 

 ment of bright points and lines, equivalent to self-luminous objects, 

 in explaining the formation of the diffraction patterns termed " anti- 

 points. " This is not a condition which is met in practical microscopy 

 except with dark ground illumination, but every skilled microscopist 

 knows that this form of illumination, although advantageous for 

 many purposes, particularly for increasing the visibility of isolated 

 points and lines, is never equal to direct light in developing true images 

 of structure, the elements of which are not separated by distances 

 exceeding their own diameters. The decreased resolution has recently 

 been explained by Nelson, and, in addition to this, false appearances 

 intermediate between true structural elements may be produced by 

 the coincidence of diffracted rays, which would not be visible with 

 direct light. 



In the rare case of opaque particles in a transparent medium, such 

 as is furnished by a rock section containing minute crystals of mag- 

 netite or pyrite, the phenomena observed at the margins of these crys- 

 tals may be explained as just the reverse of those arising from a bright 

 point image; but in the vast majority of all structures examined with 

 the microscope there will be little difference in the illumination on 

 opposite sides of a marginal line, possibly only a difference in color, and 

 whether the margin be considered as imaged by slightly refracted rays 

 or by slightly deflected diffracted rays, whether an image of the margin 

 is produced at all or only an interference of " antipoints," it is unques- 

 tionable that in certain classes of objects at least, as my experiments 

 have not covered the whole ground sufficiently to generalize, there is 

 something visible corresponding to a limiting margin, which may be 

 recognized and measured by a practiced eye, whether isolated when 

 illuminated by a wide cone or flanked on both sides by diffraction 

 bands with a narrow one. This fact had been impressed on me by 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 179 



previously made experiments, for when I first realized the effect that 

 the size of the illuminated aperture should have on the apparent size 

 of an object, the theoretical basis for this conclusion seemed so sound 

 that I started a series of measurements to establish a table of correc- 

 tions for "antipoint" for future use. 



Failing to get any consistent results, or even any variations beyond 

 the probable limits of instrumental error, in the course of micrometry 

 of various objects at odd times, I finally made the following measure- 

 ments with higher powers, adopting as most suitable objects two 

 well-stained human blood corpuscles, mounted in balsam, and so 

 marked that they could be found at any time, not only because they 

 represented a class of objects frequently subjected to measurement, 

 but also for the reason that they furnished an absorption image that 

 should be particularly susceptible to dioptric law. Full data are as 

 follows :

These measurements were made with the utmost care, the mean of 

 ten readings of the filar micrometer being taken in each case, and 

 between the readings both the object and lines of filar micrometer 

 moved and the focus changed, so that each reading required independent 

 adjustment in all respects. The actual value of the micrometer 

 divisions was not determined until after all the readings on the cor- 

 puscles were made, to avoid any possibility of unconscious mental 

 bias. Fractions of an inch are employed because my best micrometers, 

 those with the sharpest defined lines, are so ruled. It is easy to cal- 

 culate the measurements to microns if desired, but this was useless 

 in present case where the measurements had no value save for com- 

 parison. 



It will be noted that the first two measurements, with illuminating 

 cones of 1.20 and .20 N. A. respectively, agree far within the limits 

 of probable instrumental error. In fact the small variation on cor- 

 puscle No. 2 is entirely a chance result, and I have experienced such 

 close results in but one or two other cases out of many hundreds of 

 measurements. The measurements on the second evening, under still 

 different conditions, strongly confirmed the previous results. The last 

 two measurements, each of but one corpuscle, were made principally 

 to test the accuracy of the stage micrometers used, and the greater 

 variation shown, which in the fourth measurement approaches what I 

 would consider the probable limit of instrumental error under the 

 conditions, might be ascribed to the use of different stage micrometers. 

 I doubt if this is entirely true, as all my micrometers have been so 

 thoroughly and repeatedly compared and studied, that any division 

 or divisions of any one of a half dozen or more might be used with little 

 chance of serious error, the true value of each, as recorded in my note- 

 book, being of course used in making the comparison, as well as the 

 same marked position on the division, as all stage micrometers vary 

 materially not only in different divisions but in different parts of same 

 division. The best have a horizontal line on which all comparisons 

 should be made. It is more likely that the comparatively large varia- 

 tion in the fourth measurement is mostly due to the employment of 

 the Bausch & Lomb instead of the Zentmayer Filar Micrometer. 

 While the former is very accurately made, it has ruled lines instead of 

 spider webs, and therefore does not admit of such accurate definition 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 181 



and placing of the lines, measurements being of course made between 

 the interior edges of the lines, and the diameter of the latter allowed 

 for in comparing with stage micrometer. In the fifth measurement, a 

 slight error might occur from comparison with a different-sized division 

 of stage micrometer, as owing to the variation in magnification over 

 the field of ocular, even if errors of screw are immaterial, no filar micro- 

 meter is likely to give exactly double the reading on two equal divisions 

 that it will on one of them. This difference, if only centre of field is 

 employed, is too small to be serious, but in very accurate measurements 

 it is always well to compare with divisions of stage micrometer as nearly 

 as practicable corresponding to size of object measured. 



From these data it will be evident that the unquestionable presence 

 of "antipoint" phenomena need not be taken into consideration in con- 

 nection with micrometry with white light, as a trained eye can select 

 the same margins to measure under any ordinary conditions of illu- 

 mination. This is not in the least contradictory to the theory, but 

 demonstrates the possibility of overcoming a theoretical difficulty 

 in actual practice. As anyone skilled at micrometry is likely to use a 

 large cone whenever practicable, the only occasions when this question 

 will be of importance will be when successive measurements must be 

 made through covers of widely differing thickness. Owing to the 

 impossibility of making any adjustment for this variation, it may be 

 necessary to cut down the cone of illumination and depend on experi- 

 ence to select the margins to be measured. 



In considering diffraction phenomena originating in the object, it 

 will be well to first assume conditions under which the objective will 

 be of greater aperture than the illuminating cone, and will therefore, 

 when examined with ocular removed, exhibit a disk of light, the diop- 

 tric beam, surrounded by an unilluminated space. The insertion of an 

 object in the focus of the objective will result in this dark space show- 

 ing more or less light which may be both refracted and diffracted by 

 the object. If the latter has a fine structure, periodically arranged, 

 this light reaching the outer zone of the objective's aperture will be 

 mostly of diffraction origin and will take the form of separated spectra. 

 As is well known, the examination of such spectra will enable us to 

 predicate in advance what will be the arrangement and distance of 

 The structural elements visible, or if the objective is not of sufficient 

 aperture to include at least the first order spectra, no image of the struc- 

 ture will be seen. Thus in arranging the illumination for the resolu- 

 tion of a difficult object — for instance, Amphipleura pellucida in dots, 

 with a suitable objective— the easiesl way is to pay little attention to 




182 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



the image seen through the ocular, but to remove the latter after 

 focussing, and modify the illumination until two spectra at right angles, 

 as well as the dioptric beam, are visible in the back of the objective. 

 Then on inserting the ocular the resolution should be apparent at once, 

 or by making any necessary spherical corrections by means of adjust- 

 ment collar or tube length ; but as long as both spectra are not seen, it 

 is utterly useless to endeavor to effect resolution by altering the adjust- 

 ment. If after satisfactory resolution be secured one of the spectra 

 be obscured by an intruding point, only lines at right angles to the other 

 spectrum will remain visible. 



Another well-known experiment is available with any objective 

 capable of resolving Pleurosigma angulatum with a very small central 

 cone, in which case the six characteristic diffraction spectra, free from 

 refracted rays, may be seen at margin of objective. A cover glass, 

 on which have been marked with India ink six dots that will cover 

 the diffraction spectra, may now be placed behind the objective, and 

 no trace of resolution will be visible; but if the cover glass be rotated 

 30° so as to bring the dots between the spectra, the resolution will be 

 as good as before. We here have a case where radically different re- 

 sults are obtained without changing the character of the screen behind 

 the objective, and any argument that it acts as a diffraction grating 

 is invalid, because if this were the case it should so act and produce 

 similar results in one position as well as the other. It is now evident 

 that there is some connection between these diffracted beams and image 

 formation in the microscope, and the question becomes whether the 

 formation of the image is dependent on their presence, or whether they 

 are merely accompaimng phenomena which happen to appear con- 

 comitantly with conditions which would permit of similar image for- 

 mation in their absence. 



That they are actually image forming rays can be readily proved in 

 several ways, the easiest being to throw the objective out of adjustment 

 sufficiently that the rays from its outer zone, which will be the diffracted 

 rays, are brought to a different focus from those of the dioptric beam 

 in the centre, and the two images can thus be examined successively 

 by a slight change in focus. A more convincing method is that of 

 Rheinberg, in which the rays from outer zone are refracted out of the 

 optic axis and the two images can be examined or photographed 

 simultaneously. Still a third method will shortly be referred to in 

 connection with the case of an objective illuminated by a solid cone of 

 light of its own aperture, which must now be considered. 



This is a condition we rarely meet in practical microscopy except 




1909.] ' NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 183 



with low powers, as no wide-angled objectives have been made that 

 are sufficiently well corrected to stand a full cone without breaking 

 down, unless on objects such as deeply stained bacilli, where the image 

 is formed principally by absorption and is practically a silhouette. 

 There seems to be no reason why such images should not be regarded 

 as dioptric, although there must be some diffracted rays from the 

 margins which are undoubtedly utilized in the image. 



When the back of the objective is entirely filled with light, the study 

 of diffraction phenomena becomes difficult, as even with particularly 

 suitable objects the diffraction beams are eclipsed by the brighter 

 dioptric beam. As we open the iris of the condenser, however, it can 

 be seen that the diffracted beams expand to the same extent as the 

 dioptric beam, finally overlapping it and each other, until when the 

 aperture of the objective is entirely filled with dioptric light it must 

 unquestionably be similarly filled with diffracted rays. Unfortu- 

 nately, there seems to be no way in which we can completely separate 

 the beams derived from the two different sources, and the best expe- 

 dient I could devise to obtain some idea of the conditions present con- 

 sists in the use of a semicircular diaphragm in the condenser, so oriented 

 that the left side of the back of objective is completely filled with light 

 up to its margin, while the right side receives no direct rays whatever. 

 Thus we have full cone conditions on one side, while the other will 

 receive only refracted and diffracted rays, or if certain suitable objects 

 are employed nothing but diffracted rays, whose behavior we can 

 study separately. 



For this purpose a binocular microscope should be employed with a 

 specially short mounted objective, say a sixth of about .80 N. A., the 

 back lens of which will come close to the Wenham prism. All the 

 direct light from the fully illuminated left half of the objective will now 

 pass up the right-hand tube of the microscope, while the diffracted 

 beams from the right-hand half of objective will be reflected up the 

 left tube. Assuming that P. angulatum is again the object, as it fur- 

 nishes spectra singularly free from all indications of refracted light, and 

 oriented longitudinally across the field in a right-and-left direction, on 

 examining the back of objective, the previously dark space on the 

 right will be found practically filled by three of the characteristic 

 spectra of the object, and the other three will be present, although 

 invisible, in the illuminated half, where they will occupy positions near 

 the margin, as they can only be derived from central or nearly central 

 dioptric rays. The diffracted beams in right half of objective, being- 

 derived from the dioptric beam which completely fills the left half 




184 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



will extend from close to the centre of objective to beyond its margin, 

 and correspond in all essential respects to those present in a fully 

 illuminated objective, as such widely diffracted beams must be derived 

 from dioptric rays which pass through that portion of the objective's 

 aperture diametrically opposite to them. It is true these beams 

 would be expanded if the full aperture was illuminated, but the expan- 

 sion would be principally outside the margin of objective and, as far 

 as present experiment is concerned, be immaterial. The following 

 results demonstrate that three such spectra as we are considering 

 will produce an image identical with that resulting from the whole six, 

 and the conditions may be summed up as follows : 



Through the right-hand tube of the binocular, the image will be 

 produced by a full dioptric beam, supplemented by diffracted beams 

 corresponding to those resulting from a small central illuminating cone, 

 while through the left-hand tube it is derived from diffracted beams 

 alone, corresponding to those present with a full cone of illumination. 

 On examination, it will be found that both images are fairly well 

 defined, but that the resolution of the fine structure is noticeably 

 sharper and more distinct in the diffraction image through the left 

 tube. 



It will also be noted that the diffraction image is blue in color, and 

 before going further it will be well to fully understand how the colors 

 of such images are to be accounted for. The diffracted beams seen 

 at back of objective correspond to any other diffraction spectra and 

 include light of such wave lengths as enter into their formation. The 

 images resulting from their recombination will accordingly have the 

 same color as the light supplied to the microscope, as modified by 

 absorption in passing through the object, provided complete spectra 

 are included within the aperture of the objective; but should part of 

 the spectra be cut off at its margin, the diffraction images will corre- 

 spond to color sensation produced on the retina by light included in 

 that portion of the spectrum admitted, and will accordingly depend 

 on two factors: the distance between the elements of the object and 

 the aperture of the objective. Under the conditions outlined in pres- 

 ent experiment it has already been noted that the diffraction image of 

 P. angulation is blue, which is due to the red ends of its spectra being- 

 cut off at margin of the objective's aperture. If Navicula Lewisiana 

 or a coarse N. rhomboides be substituted only the violet end of the spec- 

 tra will be admitted and the unresolved image be similarly colored. 

 On the other hand, PI. formosum, whose spectra will be completely 

 admitted, will appear just as white in the diffraction as in the directly 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 1S5 



illuminated image. Intermediate forms may appear green or even of 

 a yellowish cast, but never red. 



The agreement in color of the images seen through the left tube with 

 what would be predicated from the examination of spectra admitted, 

 is further evidence that they are due practically exclusively to dif- 

 fracted rays, but still further experiment is required to demonstrate that 

 they are free from refracted rays. The spectra here seen, and which 

 have previously been considered, consist of an infinite number of over- 

 lapping images of the aperture in the subst age diaphragm , each produced 

 by light of a different wave length ; hence only the extreme ends are 

 practically pure colors, the middle portions of the spectra consisting 

 of a jumble of colors sometimes producing the effect of white light; but 

 if a narrow slit diaphragm be inserted in the condenser we can secure 

 a spectrum that corresponds in sharpness to that from an ordinary 

 spectroscope. This may be enlarged by the use of a low power 

 objective in the draw tube, focussed on the back focal plane of the first 

 objective as when using an Abbe apertometer. The microscope may 

 now be used as a spectroscope, and by allowing the light supplied to it 

 to pass through some coloring matter which has well-marked absorp- 

 tion bands, these will be visible in the spectra at back of objective. 

 A solution of Eosin, which will be needed for a later experiment, will 

 likewise answer here. It should be of such strength that when placed 

 in a glass trough and examined with a spectroscope of low dispersion, 

 it will show a black, well-defined band in the green adjoining the 

 yellow, but allow the remainder of the spectrum to pass freely. On 

 placing this trough in the path of the light used to illuminate the 

 microscope, which should be an intense one, it will be noted that the 

 absorption band in the spectrum derived from the diatom structure is 

 perfectly black, furnishing a demonstration that it is practically free from 

 refracted rays; for if it contained scattered refracted rays, as has been 

 claimed, the absorption band would not appear black, but of same color 

 as the light illuminating the object, which in this case is visually a 

 bright red. 



If we now examine the diffraction image produced under these con- 

 ditions, taking the precaution to so adjust the slit diaphragm that the 

 red end of diffraction spectrum is cut off by the margin of the objec- 

 tive's aperture, will find that it is just as blue with this visually red 

 light as it was with white light, owing to the fact that Eosin transmits 

 the blue rays freely; but the midrib of the diatom, and particularly 

 any granular incrustation, such as may usually be found at places 

 between the valve and cover-glass, will be tinted red, indicating that 




186 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



refracted rays or complete diffracted beams enter into their image 

 formation. 



Three important questions have now been settled : Firstly, that the 

 diffracted beams from certain structures are free from refracted rays; 

 secondly, that sharp distinct images may result from such diffracted 

 beams exclusively; thirdly, that where such beams are sufficiently 

 separated from the dioptric beam to permit of their being eclipsed by 

 a suitable screen, no image of the elements producing them will be 

 visible. 



Returning to the conditions of the previous experiment, we will 

 substitute for the diatom a well-stained blood slide, preferably patho- 

 logical, containing large eosinophilous leucocytes. As this is mounted in 

 balsam, the corpuscles would be scarcely visible were they not stained, 

 hence the image must be produced principally by absorption and 

 little refraction can be expected. There must be some diffraction at 

 the margins, but the diffracted beams thus produced will be slightly 

 deflected, and for all practical purposes indistinguishable in their 

 effect from refracted rays. After examining the image through right 

 tube, and noting that practically nothing can be seen save by con- 

 trast of color, even the granules of the leucocytes being " drowned out" 

 by the wide cone of illumination, the eye should be rested for several 

 minutes in a dark place, to recover its sensitiveness not merely to faint 

 images, but, what is particularly important in this case, to color sen- 

 sation, which will have been impaired by the brilliant red color of the 

 stained blood. When this has been done, the image through left tube 

 may be inspected, and as anticipated it will be found exceedingly 

 faint. Mere sketchy outlines of the corpuscles will be seen, of a red- 

 dish tint, but what will most impress the observer will "be that the 

 granular texture of the leucocytes will be quite distinctly imaged and 

 of a bluish-gray tint. It is hardly necessary to state that this indicates 

 diffraction origin of the image if the diffracted beams are deflected 

 sufficiently to be partly cut off at margin of objective, as the distancing 

 of the granules would indicate should be the case. It has already 

 been shown why the visually red Eosin stain presents no serious diffi- 

 culties in the way of a contrasting diffraction image. 



In these experiments the position of the semicircular diaphragm 

 might be reversed so as to give the diffracted beam the advantage of 

 the direct tube, but in a good Wenham binocular it makes little differ- 

 ence which tube is used. I may be particularly fortunate in this 

 respect, but among my own binoculars this is the case, and in at least 

 two of them the difference in definition between the two images is not 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 187 



greater than is commonly found between that of two objectives of 

 identical construction from the same maker. Right here it may be 

 well to mention two other fallacies regarding the Wenham binocular 

 which seem likely to be perpetuated in microscopical literature, having 

 even found a place in Spitta's recent valuable and generally accurate 

 work on the microscope. One of these is, that the beam passing up 

 the left tube produces a larger image (unless this is count aacted in 

 the ocular) because it has to travel farther on account of the two 

 reflections in the prism. As I many years ago explained, the path of 

 the beam through the prism is but slightly over one and a half times 

 the length of the path of direct beam alongside the prism. As this 

 distance is in glass of at least 1.50 R. I. the ray emerges from the prism 

 as if it had traveled only two-thirds as far in air. and the optical tube 

 length is practically identical in both tubes, the difference not reaching 

 a millimeter with an ordinary well proportioned prism. The other 

 fallacy is that such binoculars are not suited for higher powers than 

 about a half inch, while they really work well with objectives up to an 

 eighth inch or higher, if the latter are mounted, as Wenham himself 

 recommended, in short mounts, so as to avoid parallax between back 

 lens and prism. If anyone doubts the immense advantage of stereo- 

 scopic effect with high powers, let him attempt with a monocular to 

 demonstrate the anatomy, particularly the position of the unextruded 

 proboscis, in a glycerine-mounted specimen of the motile condition of 

 our too common pest, the San Jose scale, which I have never seen cor- 

 rectly figured, and then note the difference when a binocular is em- 

 ployed. The sculpturing on spores and capillitium of Myxomycetes, 

 spores of ferns, etc., afford other good tests of its efficiency. 



Returning to diffraction phenomena, I almost hesitate to refer to 

 the two experiments by which Wright seems to think he has demolished 

 the Abbe theory, as their fallacy is so self-evident that it must have 

 been at once recognized by every microscopist having more than the 

 most elementary acquaintance with the subject. The assumption, in 

 the first experiment, that when the aperture of objective is fully 

 illuminated there are no diffracted rays present, because they cannot 

 be seen, is absurd, and needs no further consideration; but anyone 

 desiring to know just what is the character of the diffracted beams 

 resulting from any particular structure under the conditions specified, 

 may secure the information by employing a pinhole diaphragm in a 

 freely moving carrier connected with substage condenser. A circle 

 should be drawn on a piece of paper to represent back of objective, 

 and the diffracted beams visible plotted in with a red and blue pencil. 




1S8 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



Diaphragm may then be moved slightly and the diffracted beams 

 again recorded on same drawing. This can be repeated until the illu- 

 mination from the pinhole has traversed every portion of the objective's 

 aperture, or until the patience of the observer is exhausted, when, if the 

 diaphragm be removed and the objective fully illuminated, it will be 

 absolutely certain that all the diffracted beams represented on the 

 composite sketch will still be present within the aperture of the objec- 

 tive. Twenty years ago Abbe published a paper dealing specially 

 with fully illuminated apertures. 



The other experiment described, which states that the image of an 

 Abbe diffraction plate, illuminated through a narrow central aperture, 

 and examined under a one-inch objective, becomes invisible when 

 sunlight is used as the source of illumination, would be equally falla- 

 cious if true, as the glare of such light might prevent any image being 

 seen, but its presence could be demonstrated by receiving it on a ground 

 glass screen or by photographing it. But even the facts are here mis- 

 stated. I did not doubt that the image might be obscured by the 

 blinding effect of direct sunlight, and merely carried out the experi- 

 ment to demonstrate that the image would appear on the screen of a 

 camera, which from photomicrographic experience I knew would be 

 the case ; but I found not only that the lines were well defined on the 

 ground glass of the camera, but also were equally distinct when exam- 

 ined directly through the microscope. Although Wright's description 

 of the experiment had been followed in every detail, the cemditions 

 were likewise varied in every possible way that might lead to the 

 results claimed. A shade prevented the sunlight from reaching any part 

 of the microscope except the mirror, but in addition it was wrapped 

 in several folds of a heavy focussing cloth, preventing the possible 

 entrance of any light save the narrow central beam, which was modified 

 in size first with the iris and then by a specially made pinhole 

 diaphragm, much smaller than could be secured with the iris, or with 

 the diaphragm accompanying the Abbe diffraction apparatus, recom- 

 mended by Wright for the purpose. The disk of the sun was focussed 

 sharply in the plane of the lines and also above and below; the con- 

 denser removed and sunlight merely restricted by the minute and 

 larger diaphragms tried; eyepieces from two-inch to one-fifth inch 

 employed; the fine one-inch objective at first used remove el and 

 replaced by the poorest one of this power in my collection, a cheap 

 single system affair of low aperture; but it was useless to change the 

 conditions, as under any of them the image remained just as sharp 

 anel distinct as it would have been with lamplight, and the only result 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 189 



of an hour's experimenting was a tired eye and the conviction that it 

 was absolutely impossible for anyone with eyesight good enough to 

 use the microscope at all to perform this experiment with the results 

 claimed. Nevertheless, devoid as it is of the slightest basis in either 

 fact or deduction, it is offered as one-half of all the evidence necessary 

 to refute so well considered a theory as that of Abbe. As it should 

 succeed under the dioptric theory, it indicates the inadequacy of that 

 theory alone to account for microscopical image formation. 



One more experiment, of the many made, may be worth mention- 

 ing. For this will be required an objective that will stand full cone 

 illumination, and a Nobert test plate or other series of rulings will 

 supply the object. No objective of more than very low power and 

 aperture will fully fill the specifications, which would require resolu- 

 tion with a full cone, equal to that with oblique light, but an old Spen- 

 cer one-half inch of 70°, which approaches perfection more closely than 

 any other objective I have seen, was found to answer the purpose. 

 If illuminated with a cone completely filling its aperture, it will be 

 found that the seventh band of the Nobert plate is well resolved, and 

 if the aperture of the illumination be cut down as far as the iris will 

 close, so the dioptric beam seen at back of objective will not exceed 

 one-twenty-fifth of the diameter of the back lens, the third band, 

 which is just twice as coarsely ruled as the seventh, will still be easily 

 and distinctly resolved. Now the aperture of the illuminating cone 

 has been cut to one-twenty-fifth, and by a strict interpretation of the 

 dioptric theory the resolution should be impaired to a similar extent, 

 but it is found to be one-half as great as with the full aperture. This 

 will be answered by the statement that the image is now formed by 

 refracted rays, outside the dioptric beam. Very well, if that is the case, 

 then one-half of the aperture of the objective is sufficient to resolve 

 the third band, and it can therefore do no harm if we contract the 

 aperture just a little, say 10 per cent., by means of an iris back of it. 

 It will be found, however, that as soon as this is done the lines com- 

 pletely disappear. In fact, just as soon as two minute diffracted 

 beams, visible at margin of objective, are partially eclipsed resolution 

 is at an end. 



This experiment, dealing with the "mystery of the dark space" 

 which led Abbe to evolve a new theory, is introduced not to demon- 

 strate that the unilluminated portion of an objective's aperture assists 

 in image formation, which every microscopist must already know, 

 but to call attention to the fact that it does so in a definite manner. 

 Under the explanation given by the advocates of the dioptric theory 




190 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



alone, different results should be secured according to the character 

 of the object. In the case of structure that could refract but little 

 light the resolution would be cut down to 10 per cent, or less, owing 

 to the large " antipoint, " which would decrease in size and permit of 

 greater resolution as the power of the object to refract rays increased, 

 until in exceptional cases resolution practically equal to that with 

 a full cone should be attainable. On the contrary it will always be 

 found that, without regard to the character of the object, the resolution 

 with central light will be just about one-half that with a full cone, or 

 in other words, will correspond to the diffracted beams admitted by 

 the objective. 



In the absence of suitable rulings, the fact referred to may be demon- 

 strated with diatoms or any other objects that may be at hand in 

 sufficient variety, by noting the finest structure resolved under the two 

 conditions of illumination, and then carefulh r counting the elements 

 of the structure resolved in a given space. On a Moller 60 diatom 

 test plate in styrax, the markings on all its forms having been accu- 

 rately counted and recorded, it was found that the above objective 

 with full cone, resolved Grammatophora serpentina, 48,000 per inch, 

 and with central light reached its limit at the third Navicula lyra, 

 24,800 per inch, confirming the results from the rulings. 



This objective, it may be mentioned, will resolve with oblique light, 

 Navicula Lewisiana, with over 58,000 markings per inch, and thus go 

 considerably beyond the usually accepted theoretical limits for its 

 aperture. The recorded aperture of the objective, measured when 

 purchased many years ago, was .57 N. A., and the markings of the 

 diatom noted as varying from 57,000 per inch near the ends to 59,000 

 at centre of valve. After this resolution was found to be unmistakable, 

 both measurements were repeated. The extreme rays entering the 

 objective were determined by an Abbe apertometer placed on revolving 

 stage with vernier and illuminated by edge of small lamp flame across 

 the room. Two readings to tenth degrees at each "end reaction" 

 agreed exactly, and the results, calculated by taking sine of the half 

 angle multiplied by the refractive index of the apertometer, gave a 

 numerical[aperture of .588 which represents the outside limits. 



A portion of the diatom valve, about half wa}^ between centre and 

 end, which had been noted as being sharply resolved from raphe to 

 margin, was then accurately counted under a high power, and the 

 mean of a number of closely agreeing counts at slightly different 

 points proved to be 58,800 per inch. The number in a full thousandth 

 i nch was counted to avoid the possibility of error in a smaller distance. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 191 



On glancing down the tube at back of objective when diatom was 

 resolved, this result was at once accounted for, as only the blue and 

 violet of the diffracted beam, with the merest tint of green, was ad- 

 mitted, and it therefore became apparent that for an objective as 

 perfectly corrected as this one, we must use the column calculated for 

 the "F" line, and not that for the "E" line, which is generally accepted 

 as more nearly representing the effect of white light. It is hardly 

 necessary to add that the resolution was effected with light from an 

 ordinary microscope lamp, without color screen or other aid, as I never 

 test an objective under any conditions, as to illumination or mounting 

 medium, that will differ from those under which it will be used in 

 routine work. It will be noted that the performance of this objective, 

 when correctly interpreted, is strongly confirmatory of the Abbe 

 theory. 



Before proceeding to draw a conclusion from these heterogeneous 

 and rambling notes, collated from records of work at odd times during 

 past couple of }^ears, I wish to reiterate the impartial attitude assumed 

 in undertaking consideration of the subject. If there was any preju- 

 dice, it was in favor of at least a partial acceptance of the dioptric 

 theory. When Wright's book was received and read, although recog- 

 nizing many of its fallacies and rendered suspicious by its commen- 

 dation of such old and discredited devices as the tandem microscope, 

 better known here as "megamicroscope," and the insertion of a stop 

 in the axis of the objective or Ramsden disk of the ocular to produce 

 dark ground illumination, which equals the Abbe diffraction appara- 

 tus in its ability to conjure up "optical nightmares," I was neverthe- 

 less profoundly impressed, and after re-reading it several times and 

 performing some of the experiments with which I had been previously 

 unacquainted, concluded that the Abbe theory must undergo at least 

 some modification; and if I no longer hold that view, it is principally 

 as the result of experiments which were inaugurated with the idea 

 of demonstrating exactly the reverse of the conclusions I was com- 

 pelled to draw from them. 



Much will of course depend on just what is understood to be included 

 in Abbe's theory, on which various writers are by no means agreed. 

 In his own papers Abbe appears to assume a thorough acquaintance 

 with optical science on the part of his readers that few of us possess, 

 hence he makes little reference to known facts and theories, but 

 occasional passages show that he did not neglect to give them full 

 consideration. In the start he unquestionably recognized the effect 

 of absorption and refraction in producing the image, and his theory 




192 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March; 



requires the presence of both dioptric and diffracted beams. Fur- 

 thermore, he lays stress on the fact that diffraction in the aperture 

 of the objective will result in every point being imaged by a "disper- 

 sive circle" (the "antipoint" of Gordon) of greater or less size accord- 

 ing to circumstances, and recommends the examination of a brightly 

 illuminated object through a pinhole one-two hundred and fiftieth of 

 an inch in diameter in a card or piece of tinfoil, to secure an idea 

 of what must be the appearance of the best image that could be pro- 

 duced through a microscope magnifying five thousand diameters, 

 even if the construction was perfect. 



If his later application of the diffraction theory to the images of 

 coarser details, earlier termed "absorption images," could be inter- 

 preted as a denial that any refracted rays, outside the dioptric beam, 

 entered into the image at all, then indeed some modification is neces- 

 sary, as most objects unquestionably refract light outside the dioptric 

 beam; and not only do the simplest laws of refraction require that these 

 rays find a place in the image, but there is no other way of accounting 

 for what becomes of them. It is more likely, however, that Abbe 

 regarded this fact as self-evident. At any rate, the important work 

 he undertook was not to refute the dioptric theory, but to supplement 

 it by accounting for phenomena which it then, as now, failed to ex- 

 plain. He has done this in so eminently satisfactory a manner that it 

 would appear that his theory, in all essential details, must be accepted, 

 unless someone can bring indisputable experimental proof of the 

 formation of a microscopical image that goes beyond its possibilities. 

 Any experiment that merely demonstrates failure to fully realize the 

 possibilities of the Abbe theory, on account of interference with image 

 formation due to diffracted rays arising in the aperture of objective, 

 or anywhere except in the object itself, is not pertinent, as this 

 unavoidable limitation was evidently fully recognized in evolving 

 the theory.

ARACHNIDA FROM COSTA RICA. 



BY NATHAN BANKS. 



During the past few years the writer has received large series of 

 spiders and daddy-longlegs from Costa Rica for identification. Most 

 of these were collected and sent by Prof. J. Fid. Tristan, of San Jose. 

 For a few years the late Dr. Paul Biolley sent me several lots, but 

 soon turned the whole matter over to Prof. Tristan. Most of the 

 specimens were collected at or near San Jose, but there are a con- 

 siderable number from the Pacific slope of the country. 



The majority of the species are of course already recorded by the 

 Biologia CentraU- America, but about 70 species are new and about 

 20 more not treated in that work. A few species recorded from 

 Costa Rica in the Biologia are not in the collections sent me. Many 

 of the Costa Rican records in the Biologia, are based on collections 

 from Dr. Biolley and Prof. Tristan, although not expressly so stated 

 in that work. The collection is similar to most tropical collections 

 of spiders — a large number of Attidse, Epeiridse, and Clubionidse, few 

 Drassidae and Thomisidse. The number of Phalangida is truly remark- 

 able. 



The web-building species show a considerable number that also 

 occur in our country, but of those not building webs there are very 

 few that extend into our borders. About seven or eight are species 

 commonly found in houses in the tropics of America. 



Altogether there are 288 species, 65 of which are Epeiridse, 48 

 Attidse and 33 Phalangida. Records without any name are all from 

 Prof. Tristan; elsewhere the collectors are given, "B. and T. " signi- 

 fying "Biolley and Tristan." Some species were collected by Mr. 

 Picado; a few by Messrs Lankester and Maxon.

P0LYCH.ET0US ANNELIDS FROM MONTEREY BAY AND SAN DIEGO, 



CALIFORNIA. 



BY J. PERCY MOORE, PH.D. 



In this paper are recorded the results of a study of the California 

 Polychseta belonging to the Museum of Leland Stanford Junior Uni- 

 versity, which were submitted to me at various times by Profs. 

 Harold Heath and W. K. Fisher of that institution. Descriptions of a 

 few new species from San Diego have been published already in these 

 Proceedings for 1904, pp. 484-503. The localities at which the collec- 

 tions were made are limited to two, namely : the vicinity of Monterey 

 Bay, at about the middle of the California coast, where Mr. M. H. 

 Spaulding collected in 1903 and 1904, chiefly at Pacific Grove, and 

 San Diego, chiefly on a sand-bar in the bay, near the southern boundary 

 of California, where Prof. E. C. Starks collected during 1902 and 

 1903. At both places the collecting was nearly limited to the littoral 

 zone between tide limits, though a few dredgings were also made. 

 A few specimens collected at Pacific Grove by Prof. Heath and 

 presented to this Academy some years ago are also mentioned. In 

 all cases where nothing different is stated it will be understood that 

 the specimens were taken between tides and by one of the two gentle- 

 men who made the bulk of the collections. Also, unless otherwise 

 stated, the types of new species are in the Museum of Stanford Uni- 

 versity. A set of cotypes and duplicates has been added to the col- 

 lection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. 



The total number of species mentioned is 64, of which 21 are con- 

 sidered to have been previously undescribed. While this must rep- 

 resent a small part only of the Polychsete fauna of that region the 

 records are important because the}' are in nearly all cases material 

 extensions of the known ranges of the species. Scarcely anything 

 has hitherto been published concerning the Polychseta of the coast 

 of the southern half of California or of the Pacific coast of Mexico and 

 a rich field for faunal investigation remains. When these collections 

 were placed in my hands for study it was hoped that Prof. H. P. 

 Johnson's projected paper on the Polychseta of California would be 

 available for their determination, but this much-desired publication 

 has been unavoidably delayed.

SYLLID^3. 



Syllis elongata Johnson. 



Pionosyllis elongata (Johnson), Proc. Bos. Soc. Nat. Hist., XXIX, pp. 

 403-405; PI. 6, figs. 67-70; PL 7, fig. 71. 



Dredged at Delmonte wharf, vicinity of Monterey Bay, July 12, 1904. 



A fine specimen 40 mm. long, with 193 segments, the last 28 or 29 

 of which are much distended with sperm and elongated to three times 

 the length of the preceding 29 segments. The notocirri are more 

 tapered and acute than represented in Johnson's figure. This species 

 is very slender and in general aspect closely resembles Syllis gracilis 

 Grube. At least the dorsalmost seta of many of the middle segments 

 has the appendage coalesced with the stem to form bifurcate setae 

 as in that species. Probably it should be placed in VerriU's subgenus 

 Synsyllis. It certainly departs widely from the type of Pionosyllis 

 in the form of its setae and its strongly moniliform tentacles and cirri. 

 The posterior region is so much enlarged that it seems probable that it 

 separates at maturity. 



Tr ypanosyllis intermedia sp. nov. (Plate VII, figs. 1 and 2). 



An imperfectly known species resembling T. gemmi'para Johnson 

 in general aspect, but readily distinguished from that species by the 

 much longer appendages of its setae. 



Length of the anterior 80 segments of an incomplete specimen, 18 

 mm. ; maximum width between tips of parapodia, 2 mm. 



Prostomium quadrate, silghtly wider than long, with a median dorsal 

 furrow. Eyes small, red, dorso-lateral ; the anterior slightly farther 

 apart and less than one-eighth the width of the prostomium ; the pos- 

 terior pair about one-twelfth the width of the prostomium and separ- 

 ated from the anterior by an equal distance. Palpi about as long as 

 prostomium, projecting forward and widely divergent. Tentacles 

 all missing. 



Anterior end of body broad and strongly depressed, becoming 

 gradually less so posteriorly. Segments all extremely short and 

 crowded, especially anteriorly, where they are slightly biannulate. 

 Pygidium unknown. 



Parapodia uniramous, short, stout and slightly notched distally. 

 Neurocirri short, cylindrical, rounded distally, and arising from middle 

 of ventral face of neuropodia, the end of which they scarcely reach. 

 Notocirri arising from prominent cirrophores immediately above 

 the base of the neuropodia; styles very readily detached and only a 

 few remaining so that their relative length is unknown, those remain- 

 ing rather stout, swollen beyond base and thence tapered to the blunt 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 237 



end, the longer ones about equal to total width of worm and with about 

 20 short articles, the shorter two-thirds as long with about 15 articles. 



Acicula three, tapered, with the ends blunt, slightly flattened and 

 just perceptibly enlarged. Setae few (about 9-11), all subacicular, 

 colorless, with rather strongly curved steins acutely beveled at the 

 end, smooth, with a slight shoulder for attachment of the appendage 

 (Plate VII, figs. 1 and 2); length of appendages varying from one 

 and one-third times (on posterior parapodia) to more than twice (on 

 anterior parapodia) the distal thickness of the stems, their distal ends 

 hooked and conspicuously bifid, the teeth being much more widely 

 separated on posterior setse, on which also the marginal fringe is much 

 less developed. 



The single incomplete specimen was taken at "point above Third 

 Beach," vicinity of Monterey Bay, July 12, 1904. 



PHYLLODOCID^E. 



Phyllodooe medipapillata sp. nov. (Plate VII, figs. 3 and 4). 



The two examples upon which this species is based differ greatly 

 in appearance and degree of contraction, one being robust, the other 

 very slender. Length of type 100 mm., maximum width of body 

 1.8 mm., total width including parapodia 3.5 mm.; number of seg- 

 ments 201. Length of cotype 170 mm., width of body 3.5, total width 

 including parapodia 8 mm. ; number of segments 240. 



Prostomium rather thick, depressed, broad, slightly cordate behind; 

 about as wide as long, the greatest breadth at the eyes about one- 

 third of the length from the posterior end, the sides very strongly 

 convex at this point; anterior border broadly rounded, projecting 

 slightly beyond tentacles. Eyes circular, their diameter about one- 

 eighth to one-tenth width of prostomium, at the widest part of which 

 they are situated, separated by about one-half its width. The tentacles, 

 which arise from a shallow annular depression, short conical, diverging 

 equally in both directions, about as long as one-third width of prosto- 

 mium. Nuchal organs everted as prominent knobs between sides of 

 prostomium and peristomium just below e}^es. A minute nuchal 

 tubercle, about one-third diameter of nuchal organs, occupies the 

 posterior emargination of the prostomium. 



Peristomium and somite II coalesced, achaetous, nearly concealed 

 above by the prostomial lobes, between which the nuchal tubercle 

 projects; below forming a smooth, somewhat swollen lip. Except in 

 the character of its parapodia III is similar to succeeding segments. 

 Tentacular cirri all short, with distinct cirrophores and rather stout 




238 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



styles tapering to delicate tips. On the type they reach to the fol- 

 lowing segments; that of I to VII, dorsal of II and III both to IX, 

 ventral of II to VI or VII. On the cotype, which has the anterior 

 segments much contracted, each reaches about three segments farther 

 caudad. 



The body of the type is slender, slightly depressed, flattened ventrally, 

 widest in anterior fourth, and tapers regularly caudad; the length of 

 the segments varies from one-fifth the width anteriorly to two-thirds 

 width posteriorly. As noted above the cotype is much contracted 

 and consequently much stouter. Fygidium unknown. 



Parapodia (Plate VII, fig. 3) uniramous, prominent, strictly lateral, 

 posteriorly equaling width of somites. That of I a tentacular cirrus 

 (neurocirrus) only; of II dorsal and ventral tentacular cirri (notocirrus 

 and neurocirrus); III the first setigerous. Typical parapodia consist 

 of somewhat flattened neuropodia supported by a single, stout, tapered 

 aciculum and divided at the distal end into a low, entire post-setal lip 

 and a slightly more prominent presetal lip divided by a notch into 

 supra-acicular and subacicular lobes, to the dorsal border of the latter 

 of which the slightly curved end of the aciculum is adherent. 



Foliaceous notocirri begin on IV and foliaceous neurocirri on III; 

 both are prominent and the former strongly imbricated on the dorsum 

 of the parapodia, Notocirrophores prominent, erect, well separated 

 from the neuropodia, more than half as long as the latter and equally 

 broad. Styles not strongly asymmetrical, with basal auricles only 

 slightly developed, those of anterior segments nearly regularly ovoidal, 

 with bluntly rounded ends and about two-thirds as wide as long. 

 Farther back they increase in size and become more slender (twice 

 as long as wide) and more acutely tipped, without any trace of the 

 truncate end seen in so many species, though the tips of some are 

 slightly recurved. On middle somites they approach nearer to the 

 ovate-lanceolate form usual in Eulalia rather than the form usually 

 characterizing PhyUodoce. In the posterior third they again become 

 shorter and broader — much like poplar leaves — with rather abruptly 

 acuminate tips. Rather firmly attached, of thin, membranous tex- 

 ture and with a striated border of colored glands. Neurocirri attached 

 by low, broad eirrophores to the bases of the neuropodia. Styles all 

 very large and foliaceous and projecting one-third or more of their 

 length beyond the neuropodia. On the first few segments they are 

 very broad and subelliptical, but soon become more acute and asym- 

 metrical and gradually much more elongated and slender. 



Setse (Plate VII, fig. 4) all colorless, in fan-shaped supra- and sub- 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 239 



acicular fascicles of (in the type) from eight (on IX) to twenty-six (on 

 XXV), decreasing to eleven or twelve at CL, the cotype bearing about 

 one-third as many more. Stems slightly curved and slightly enlarged 

 distally to form an oblique socket, each side of which bears a small 

 brush of hairs, none of which is enlarged. Appendages very long, 

 slender, tapering, slightly curved, with a border of minute serrations; 

 their length is from more than one-half to nearly the depth of the 

 neuropodia and they vary little in the different regions. 



Proboscis of type fully extended, clavate, 7 mm. long, 1.8 mm. in 

 distal and 1.2 mm. in basal diameter. Orifice surrounded by nineteen 

 rather prominent, compressed ovoid papilla?. Greater part of surface 

 smooth, with six very obscure longitudinal ridges becoming gradually 

 more roughened toward the base. Papillse confined to basal one-sixth 

 or less, arranged in six longitudinal rows on each side separated by 

 dorsal and ventral intervals, of which the former is the greater and 

 about equals the width of the papillated areas. The papillae are 

 slightly flattened and the posterior face is brown. Each row contains 

 from nine or ten (ventral) to twelve (dorsal), the increased number 

 resulting from a few papillse placed irregularly at the anterior end of 

 the more dorsal rows. In addition to the paired series, about four or 

 five very small papillae form an irregular dorso-median row. Except 

 for the greater contraction the proboscis of the cotype is exactly 

 similar. 



Color of type confined to a brownish tinge on the dorsum and 

 notocirri; cotype uniform purplish-brown. 



Type locality, vicinity of Monterey Bay, M. H. Spaulding. The 

 •cotype was taken at San Diego by E. C. Stark.

 XLI (1879), Math-naturw. CL, 2d Abth., pp. 127, 128, Tab. Ill, fig. 2. 



A much contracted specimen which agrees very closely with 

 v. Marenzeller's description was dredged by Mr. Spaulding on July 12, 

 1903, at Delmonte wharf, near Monterey Bay. Length 21 mm. ; 

 segments 160. 



Prostomium regularly subovate, about as broad as long, truncate 

 posteriorly with a very slight median emargination; no anterior 

 constriction or furrow. Eyes very large, dorso-lateral, about one- 

 fourth diameter of prostomium and about an equal distance apart. 

 Tentacles lateral and ventrolateral, near anterior end of prostomium, 

 directed almost laterad and very little forward, acutely subulate, 

 thickened toward base, the dorsal pair as long as prostomium, the 

 ventral two-thirds as long. 




240 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



Tentacular cirri very much crowded, slightly flattened, very short, 

 the longest (dorsal of II) about four times length of prostomium and 

 reaching VII, the shortest (ventral of II) about twice prostomium, 

 the remaining two subequal and about two and one-half times prosto- 

 mium. Peristomium and II coalesced and scarcely visible from 

 above. There may be a minute nuchal tubercle, but this is uncertain. 

 Pygidium a minute ring bearing a pair of short, subulate cirri. 



Notocirrophores low and broad, styles rather thick and easily 

 detached, in this specimen carried nearly erect over the parapodia; 

 broadly foliaceous, nearly uniform in size and shape throughout, 

 triangular ovate, about three-fifths as wide as long with rounded 

 apex and oblique but not auriculate base, the markings arranged 

 bipinnately from a central axis. 



Neurocirri foliaceous, subquadrate elliptical, all free surfaces 

 evenly rounded, very broadly attached to venter of neuropodium 

 and carried posterior to the latter, scarcely reaching beyond end of 

 neuropodium. 



Aciculum single, stout, tapered, straight. Seta? in spreading, 

 vertical series, colorless, transparent, rather stout, with curved stems 

 rather abruptly enlarged distally, the margins of the socket bearing 

 a single series of rather long hairs. Appendages short, their length 

 not exceeding one-third depth of parapodia, very delicate, broad at 

 base but rapidly tapering to a tenuous tip; marginal serrations scarcely 

 visible. Six supra- and ten subacicular setse on middle parapodia. 



Color pale reddish-brown, brightest on notocirri and anterior 

 dorsum of body. Female with immature eggs.

Three specimens occur in the collection, two certainly from the 

 Monterey Bay region, the other unlabeled but probably from the same 

 place. Of the first two one was commensal on the holothurian Sticho- 

 pus, the other on Cryptochiton. The latter is a fine specimen with 

 milk-white elytra marked with a small, round, clear-cut black spot 

 over the area of attachment.

of Monterey Bay, at "big tide pool, Lighthouse Point," on June 28,

 All of the specimens are dark colored, with heavily mottled elytra.

Eleven specimens from San Diego occur in the collection and only 

 two from Monterey Bay, where they were dredged on July 9, 1904. 



These specimens exhibit considerable variation. Some are almost 

 pigmentless and of a nearly uniform pale yellow, gray or brown; 

 others are thickly mottled with deep brown on the elytra and barred 

 on both dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body. Usually a brown 

 spot or ring is present on the elytra over the point of attachment. 

 The elytra differ greatly in the degree to which the surface is roughened 

 with conical projections and in the number of marginal cilia. The 

 latter appear to be gradually lost with increased age and size. They 

 are plentiful on the elytra of small specimens and on newly regenerated 

 elytra, fewer on those of medium size and frequently totally absent 

 from larger specimens, as is the case with the two from Monterey Bay. 

 As a result of loss and regeneration the elytra of some specimens are 

 of very unequal size. The labels give no information concerning 

 commensalism.

Three examples from San Diego. One has the parapodia much 

 entangled with Terebellid tentacles and probably came from the tube 

 of the Am.phitrite with which Johnson states that it lives commensally. 

 Notopodial setse are more usually present in the anterior parapodia, 

 and the first parapodium bears a single seta of a form intermediate 

 between the typical notopodial and neuropodial types. 



One specimen 89 mm. long and having 83 somites has the elytra 



arranged in symmetrical pairs, except on somite LXV, which bears 



the right one only, the left side bearing a notocirrus; there are 39 pairs 



on the segments numbered 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 25, 27, 28, 30,

Two examples from San Diego and one from Chinatown Point, 

 August 12, 1904. 



One specimen is 110 mm. long with 172 pairs of elytra; the other is 



about the same size, but the number of elytra was not counted. The 



first mentioned has a caudal regenerating region of about a dozen 



segments, so that it is probable that the species reached a considerably 



larger size than the original description indicated. The first pair of 



elytra is pale and without markings, the others are of a darker brown, 



thickly and finely mottled with a reticular pattern of black. The 



pygidium, which was not described by Johnson, bears a pair of subanal 



cirri about as long as the last six or seven segments and of slender, 



tapered form. The distal papilla? of both rami of the parapodia are 



frequentty more numerous than indicated in Johnson's figure.

This species is represented in the collection by about a dozen speci- 

 mens from San Diego and a single one from Monterey Bay, collected 

 on July 12, 1904, from the "point above Third Beach." 



Johnson gives no account of the proboscis, and as one of the 

 specimens has it protruded the following brief description is added. 

 It is about 3 mm. long and 1.8 mm. in diameter, subcylindrical, but 

 slightly compressed and slightly wider distally than at the base. It 

 terminates in a firm elliptical disk, with a vertical slit open ventrally 

 and a central depression in which the mouth lies; surrounding this 

 disk is a low annular fold. The cuticle is everywhere smooth, without 

 papillse, jaws or teeth of any kind.

About fifty specimens collected at San Diego are stated to have 

 been "parasitic on starfish." 



The occurrence of this species on a starfish (Luidia) in the vicinity 

 of Port Townsend has been already reported in these Proceedings for 

 1908 and it seems probable that this habit is general. The reference 

 by Harrington and Griffin in their paper on Puget Sound Inverte- 

 brates to "the curious Ophiodromvs, an annelid that lives between 

 the arms of the starfish [Asterias] and is colored so as to resemble the 

 surface of the latter," probably relates to this species. 



The appendages of some of the dorsalmost setae of the subacicular 

 fascicle and the ventralmost of the supra-acicular fascicle are much 

 longer and more slender than the others. 



NEPHTHYDIDJE. 

 Nephthys caeca ( Fabricius) Oersted. 



Nereis coeca, Fabricius, Fauna Groenlandica, 17S0, p. 304. 



This species is represented by six large specimens from the vicinity 

 of Monterey Bay and by about twenty from San Diego, where it appears 

 to be common and was taken from the littoral zone and down to a 

 depth of fifty feet. 



The San Diego examples are of small to medium size and colorless 

 or slightly marked with brown figures and bands on the prostomium 

 and a feAv anterior segments. The setae of some specimens are long, 

 of others short and one of the latter is filled with nearly mature ova. 



Those from Monterey Bay are much larger, measuring about ISO 

 mm. in length and one counted having 152 segments. Three of them 

 are very smooth and colorless, except that there is a brown or black 

 "spread-eagle" figure on the prostomium and crossbars on a few an- 

 terior segments. The others have the body of a deep purplish brown 

 both dorsally and ventrally, the parapodia colorless. 



The free margins of the prostomium are thin and produced. The 

 serrated setae form long flowing tufts, dusky at the base, as long as 

 the parapodia or nearly equal to the body width. The annulated 

 setae are short and small, except on anterior parapodia. Several 

 specimens have the single caudal cirrus intact. 



The extended proboscis is rather slender clavate with ten bifid 

 orifical papillae above and ten below and twenty-two longitudinal 




244 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



rows of conical papillae of usually five each, the unpaired dorsal and 

 ventral papillae being no larger than the others. 



No characters distinguishing these specimens from examples of the 

 species from the Atlantic Ocean are obvious. 



NEREIDS. 



Nereis procera Ehlers. 



Nereis procera Ehlers, Die Borstenwiirmer, 1868, pp. 557-559; Taf. XXIII, 

 fig- 2. 



Ten specimens were taken in the vicinity of Monterey Bay, two 



bearing each of the following labels: Point about Third Beach; Big 



tide pool, Lighthouse Point, June 20, 1905, and June 28. 1904; dredged 



July 9, 1904, and dredged Delmonte wharf, July 12, 1904. Of the three 



from San Diego one is 3 mm. in diameter and filled with large eggs. 



The parapodia and other parts exhibit no epitokous modification. 



Nereis (Alitta) vexillosa Grube. 



Nereis vexillosa Grube, in Middendorff, Reise in Siberiens, etc., II, 1851, 

 p. 4; Taf. II, figs. 1, 5, 6. 



Taken at San Diego only; 14 small atokes and one small female 

 epitoke. The largest of the atokes is 50 mm. long, and all of them have 

 the not'ocirral laminae much less developed than on larger specimens. 

 One exserted proboscis has paragnaths arranged as follows: I, three 

 in a longitudinal series; II, tapering arcuate groups of three rows of 

 small cones ; III, transverse band in three rows ; IV, wider curved band, 

 broader behind; V, absent; VI, four large cones in lozenge-shaped 

 figure; VII and VIII, broad transverse band encircling ventral and 

 lateral portion of basal ring, a tract of very small paragnaths in front 

 of ventral part. 



The epitoke is filled with large eggs. The parapodia agree with 

 Johnson's figure, but the setae are arranged somewhat differently. 

 Those of the dorsal rami are all of the "fish-bone" type, the stout 

 compound setae belonging to the dorsal supra-acicular fascicle of the 

 neuropodium. The paragnaths exhibit several peculiarities; their 

 number is generally reduced, those of VI are coalesced into a single 

 large one on each side ; V is present as a single cone. 



Nereis (Alitta) virens plenidentata subsp. nov. 



Under this name I am recording provisionally a species of Alitta 

 that appears to be quite common on the sand-bars in San Diego Bay. 

 The northern Pacific species, which is found from Ochotsk Sea and 

 Alaska south nearly to San Francisco, seems to differ from Atlantic 

 examples of A. virens in several respects, and particularly in having 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 245 



more numerous paragnaths and a greater number of segments. Prob- 

 ably it must be considered to be at least a subspecies under the name 

 of brandti Malmgren. 



These specimens from southern California exhibit more extreme 

 divergence in the same direction. Like both of the forms mentioned 

 the paragnaths are reduced in number with age and increased size, 

 but compared with specimens of the same size they are very much 

 more numerous. For example a specimen 150 mm. long and 8 mm. 

 wide between the tips of the parapodia and having 218 segments 1 has 

 the hard, black, strictly conical paragnaths arranged as follows: I, 

 3 in tandem; II, small groups of 7-9 in two oblique rows; III, broad 

 dense, transverse band of small cones chiefly arranged in longitudinal 

 or somewhat oblique lines of six or seven each, with numerous shorter 

 lines and small groups uniting them anteriorly; IV, dense, somewhat 

 arched, dumbbell-shaped groups of small cones, from three to five 

 across and tending to coalesce at their posterior ends with the lateral 

 borders of III; V, a diffuse subcircular area spreading laterally to 

 the level of VI and with a median row of four large paragnaths reaching 

 anteriorly beyond the others ; VI, a compact group of four or five large 

 cones forming a lozenge-shaped figure; VI and VII coalesced and 

 forming a broad zone encircling the basal ring of the proboscis below 

 the level of VI and nearly joining V above, the numerous cones (from 

 six to ten in the width of the band) increasing in size and becoming 

 more distant anteriorly and dorsally. 



The tentacles are also longer and most of the specimens are note- 

 worthy for the deep brown pigment deposited in the lamellar noto- 

 cirrophores. 



The relations of this form to N. virens and brandti will be discussed 

 fully at another time, when I hope to have for comparison specimens 

 from other parts of the California coast. 



N. foliata Baird evidently applies to the northern form ; N. chilensis 

 Ehlers (=Thoosa Gayi Kinberg) is not at present recognizable, and 

 there appears to be no name for this southern form. 

 Nereis (Platynereis) agassizi Ehlers.

 fig. 1. 



A few small specimens were taken at San Diego and two at Monterey 

 Bay, one of the latter dredged and one between tides at the "point 

 above Third Beach. 



J! 



1 A specimen of N. virens from New Jersey of the same size has 130 segments. 




246 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



The San Diego specimens are noteworthy for the very conspicuous 

 notopodial spots and in one case for the equally conspicuous spots on 

 the pygidium. The example dredged at Monterey is filled with small 

 eggs and has the eyes enlarged, but is not otherwise modified. 



EUNICID^E. 

 Eunice (Eriphyle) paloloides sp. nov. (Plate VII, figs. 5-7). 



The type of this species is a nearly complete worm closely related 

 to the celebrated "palolo" (Eunice viridis) which it resembles in 

 form. It consists of a thicker anterior non-sexual region of about 

 200 segments and a slender posterior sexual region of more than 550 

 segments. Owing to the softening of a portion of the worm the exact 

 point of transition cannot be determined and accurate measurements 

 cannot be given. The size and proportions, however, closely approxi- 

 mate those of E. viridis. 



Prostomium (somewhat distorted by protrusion of the jaws) about 

 twice as wide as long, broadening anteriorly where it is divided into 

 two s*hort, wide, broadly rounded lobes by a shallow emargination 

 which continues caudad as a dorso-median furrow; a transverse fur- 

 row passes across the posterior ventral part of each of these frontal 

 lobes. Five tentacles arranged in a nearly straight transverse line, 

 the middle one being slightly behind the others and in contact with the 

 nuchal fold. Middle one slightly the longest (H times length of 

 prostomium), the lateral shortest and separated from the second pair 

 by a wider space than separates the latter from the median. All 

 regularly tapered and transversely wrinkled, but not beaded or articu- 

 lated. Eyes conspicuous, with large lenses, situated between the 

 outer and inner paired tentacles close to base of latter. On one side 

 a rather conspicuous pigment spot lies just anterior and external to 

 the lateral tentacle. 



Peristomium a slightly swollen naked ring considerably longer than 

 the prostomium and forming a distinct nuchal fold dorsally, but little 

 swollen laterally. Somite II is a short, simple, apodous ring bearing, 

 close to the anterior border, and on a level with the lateral tentacles, 

 a pair of short conical nuchal cirri slightly longer than the segment. 



Segments of anterior region very short, flattened and concave 

 below, at first strongly arched above but gradually becoming flatter 

 and more depressed. Owing to the poor preservation of the segments 

 following CC it is not possible to determine at just what point the epi- 

 tokous sexual region separates, but a marked softening of the tissues 

 and the enlarged size of the neural eye-spots (phototactic organs) on 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 247 



subsequent segments indicates that it probably occurs at CCX, though 

 eye-spots of smaller size appear abruptly at CLII. 



The epitokous region is very slender, subterete or slightly depressed, 

 with a well-defined neural groove and distinct furrows separating 

 segments generally about three times as wide as long. Surrounding 

 each segment in the parapodial zone is a raised glandular band, some- 

 times single but oftener formed of two lines. Posteriorly the body 

 tapers and is composed of numerous very small segments — evidently 

 a rapidly proliferating region. The ventral eye-spots form a neural 

 series of usually two spots to each segment: one on the glandular 

 girdle, the other at the intersegmental furrow, sometimes one, some- 

 times the other being larger and frequently one or both subdivided. 



Pygidium tubular and somewhat elongated, obliquely truncated 

 with the small anus facing dorsad; posterior to anus two pairs of 

 conical caudal cirri, of which the dorsal pair is about as long as the 

 diameter of the pygidium and nearly three times the ventral. 



Parapodia uniramal. Typical parapodia of the anterior region 

 consist of a short, broad, truncate neuropodium, bearing a low post- 

 setal fold behind the compound setae and a small presetal lobe in front 

 of the simple setae. The simple notocirrus springs without a cirro- 

 phore from above the neuropodium and is a bent, slightly tapered 

 blunt process reaching a short distance beyond the distal end of the 

 foot. Neurocirrus consists of a low glandular elliptical cirrophore 

 adnate to the side of the segment ventral to the parapodium and 

 bearing a small, blunt, cylindroid or conical style. Farther back all 

 parts and particularly the cirri are gradually reduced in size. The 

 first parapodium (on III) has the setigerous lobe rudimentary, bearing 

 only two or three setse, and consists chiefly of a simple notocirrus and 

 neurocirrus nearly in contact, the former shorter and stouter, the 

 latter about twice as long, more slender, obscurely articulated and 

 more or less bent into a bow. Several succeeding parapodia are 

 transitional to the typical form, springing from a gradually rising level, 

 the neuropodium gradually increasing in size and the cirri becoming- 

 smaller. In the epitokous region the entire foot is much smaller, the 

 neuropodium a conical process whose outlines pass into the dorsal and 

 ventral curvatures of the segments, the notocirrus a minute conical 

 process above the foot and at the base of the gill, and a similarly formed 

 neurocirrus arising from a thick glandular ventral area or cirrophore. 



Gills appear as a pair of minute papillae on the medial side of the 

 base of the notocirri of CVII and increase in length gradually until 

 they become slender tapering filaments having a length of one-half 




248 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



to one-third the body width, the longest ones in the neighborhood 

 of somite CC reaching easily beyond the middle line; in the posterior 

 region they continue nearly to the pygidium and as far as the last 

 one hundred segments reach to the median line. 



Acicula anteriorly are three or four, stout, tapered, chiefly very dark 

 brown, the dark tips exposed, blunt, somewhat oblique but not knobbed. 

 Posteriorly there are but two and finally one, and except that they 

 become more slender there is no change in form. 



Setse are of two forms: simple supra-acicular and compound sub- 

 acicular. No pectinate setse are visible in any of the preparations. 

 Simple seta? have long, slender shafts, dark colored toward the base, 

 but pale distally; they project prominently, the ends being slightly 

 doubly curved and gently tapered to very slender acute tips with a 

 faint marginal fringe but no distinct limbus. Somite III bears only 

 three or four simple setse, the number increasing to about twenty on 

 X. Behind C the number again diminishes, but the setse become first 

 longer, then very few and of small size on the caudal segments. Com- 

 pound setse (PL VII, fig. 5) are enlarged toward the distal ends of the 

 shaft which bears a few small marginal teeth, the appendage broad, 

 bidentate and slightly hooked distally and provided with a fringed 

 guard, its length one and one-half times width of enlarged end of 

 shaft and remarkably uniform on all parapodia. They are absent 

 from III and numerous by X, on which they form rows extending 

 anterior to and below the acicula. Farther back they undergo changes 

 similar to those affecting the simple setae. 



Mandibles (PI. VII, fig. 6) large, very hard, the horny carriers 

 yellowish with dark lines, very thick and firm, with an angular ridge 

 running the entire length. Jaw plates very large, white, calcareous, 

 of stony hardness, each plate bent nearly into a semicircle at the free 

 margin which is faintly denticulated, the dorso-lateral angle freely 

 projecting. Maxillse (PI. VII, fig. 7) deep brown, hard. Carriers of 

 forceps jaws broad with lateral emarginations and the two halves 

 closely united except at the caudal end; forceps with broad bases 

 marked by three longitudinal ridges, no masticatory teeth and short, 

 strongly hooked ends. Second pair (II) massive with four stout teeth 

 on the left and three and a rudimentary fourth on the right side. 

 Three accessory jaws (III, IV, V) each with a single tooth on the 

 left side arranged in a semicircle and two, one with two teeth, the 

 other with a single tooth, on the right side. 



Color of anterior end deep, iridescent purple, posterior reproductive 

 region of male pale brown, of female greenish drab with white rings. 

 Ventral phototactic organs brown. 






1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 249 



Collected by Prof. E. C. Starks at San Diego, Cal. Besides the 

 nearly complete type there is a fragment of the reproductive region 

 of a male and one of a female, both fully mature and probably nearly 

 ready to separate and swarm. 



The occurrence of a Eunice with the habits of a "palolo" worm on 

 the California coast is of much interest, and it is to be hoped that 

 some zoologist on the ground will determine its life-history and es- 

 pecially the habits of swarming and if possible the conditions affecting 

 it. While the species is closely related to Eunice viridis and E. 

 siciliensis it is readily enough distinguished from both. -

San Diego, type and cotype only. 

 Marphysa stylobranchiata sp. nov. (Plate VII, figs. 8-12). 



Form moderately stout. Length about 100 mm., the longest 110 

 mm. long and 4.5 mm. in maximum width at about XXX. Number 

 of segments 142-160. 



Prostomium about one-half as wide as long, divided anteriorly 

 into two broadly rounded prominent entire lobes which exhibit no 

 ventral furrow or swelling. Tentacles five, smooth, short, thick, 

 sausage-shaped, arranged in a slightly curved row near the posterior 

 end of the prostomium; middle one longest, nearly equal to length of 

 prostomium, the outer pair shortest, about two-thirds length of middle 

 tentacle. Eyes small, behind interval between outer and middle ten- 

 tacles, or absent. 



Peristomium about three times as long as first setigerous segment, 

 perfectly naked, divided into two rings probably representing seg- 

 ments, the posterior slightly more than one-half anterior, from which 

 it is separated by a continuous faint groove. Laterally the anterior 

 ring projects somewhat forward and is united with the sides of the 

 prostomium, thus concealing a small internal or mandibular lobe. 

 Remaining segments well defined by deep furrows, all short, strictly 

 uniannular, generally one-sixth to one-eighth as long as wide. To 

 about somite VIII the body is quite terete, but soon becomes wider 

 than deep, the ratio in the middle region being about as five to three. 

 Posteriorly the body tapers, first gently, then rapidly, to the pygidium, 

 which is short, annular, radially furrowed or rosetted and bears a pair 

 of rather stout, tapering ventral cirri as long as the last five or six 

 segments and below these a second pair of minute cirri. 




250 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



Parapodia strictly uniramous, lateral, the first five or six more 

 ventral than the others. Neuropodium short, stout, bearing a fleshy 

 post-acicular lobe on anterior parapodia which disappears on middle 

 and posterior ones. Anterior to this is a row of conspicuous black 

 acicula and a rather complex group of seta?. Notocirrus of first 

 parapodium (III) rather stout, conical, tapering, simple, free from 

 but immediately above foot and about twice as long as the latter; 

 thence becoming gradually smaller caudad and in branchial region 

 reduced to a mere tubercle, but increasing in length again posteriorly. 

 Neurocirrus coalesced with base of neuropodium, consisting of a stout, 

 swollen cirrophore and a short, thick, cylinclroid, imperfectly differen- 

 tiated style; farther back the cirrophore merges more into the body 

 outline and the style becomes more slender but is otherwise unaltered. 



Gills simple, tapering filaments throughout. The first appears as a 

 minute papilla on the notocirrus of XVI to XX, but they are usually 

 not developed into efficient gills for several segments. At XXI or 

 XXII they are usually as long as the notocirrus; in the middle region 

 they reach the middle line and posteriorly gradually diminish in size 

 and finally disappear about twenty segments anterior to the pygidium. 



Acicula three to five anteriorly, simple, tapered, black, with pale 

 tips little or not at all exposed. They become gradually longer, 

 constantly three in number, conspicuous with prominently projecting 

 bluntly-pointed tips which are always pale with black cores. Some- 

 where between XX and XXX and on following segments an especially 

 large one diverges from the others and protrudes from the surface 

 between the neurocirrus and the compound setae. 



Setae all nearly or quite colorless, of three forms : two forms of simple 

 setae in supra-post-acicular fascicles and compound setae in sub-pre- 

 acicular fascicles. Compound setae (PI. VII, fig. 10) numerous, es- 

 pecially anteriorly where they occur in several rows anterior as well 

 as ventral to the acicula; farther back they become fewer and are 

 confined to the ventral group. The stems are gently curved and 

 very little thickened distally; the appendages very uniformly of a 

 length about four times the distal diameter of the stem with obscurely 

 hooked bidentate tips and a finely fringed border separating at the 

 tip into the usual guard. The fascicles of simple setae consist chiefly 

 of curved, capillary, slightly limbate or at least flattened setae (PI. 

 VII, fig. 8) considerably longer than the compound setae. Concealed 

 among the bases of the latter on the acicular side of the fascicle is a 

 group of very delicate gouge-shaped, pectinate setae (PL VII, fig. 9), 

 very few anterior^, more numerous farther back and apparently all 

 of one form. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 251 



Jaws of somewhat soft and flexible brown chitinoid material, the 

 teeth somewhat whitened and hardened by a calcareous deposit. 

 Mandibles (PI. VII, fig. 11) consisting of long, slender, strongly diver- 

 gent carriers, firmly united anteriorly and bearing white, hard, cal- 

 careous, subovate distal plates with smooth and entire margins. For- 

 ceps jaws (PI. VII, fig. 12) massive, with an undivided, shield-shaped 

 base about three-fifths as wide as long, truncate distally, pointed 

 behind ; the forceps stout with strongly ridged but toothless bases and 

 hooked tips flattened and angulated along the concavity. Second 

 pair of maxillae (II) also massive, the left one with three, the right 

 with four stout teeth. Maxillae (III) consist of a pair of crescentic 

 plates bearing ridges with five teeth on the left, six on the right side; 

 IV bears three or four stout teeth on the left side and a low edentulous 

 ridge on the right side; V is represented on the left side only and is 

 similar to the right IV. 



Color in life unknown, but probably pale reddish like other species 

 of the gems. 



Known only from the vicinity of Monterey Bay; "big tide pool.

Marphysa californica sp. nov. (Plates VII and VIII, figs. 13-20). 



This species is based upon the anterior ends of two specimens, one 

 (type) very large, measuring 11 mm. wide and 80 mm. long for 92 

 segments, the other, consisting of 140 segments, 45 mm. long and 3 

 mm. wide. Both are much contracted. 



Prostomium retracted beneath nuchal collar as far as base of ten- 

 tacles, the exposed portion nearly as wide as long and consisting 

 chiefly of the pair of broadly ovate frontal lobes divided by a median 

 furrow that reaches nearly to the median tentacle, but with no trace 

 of a ventral transverse furrow. Tentacles five, arising along a trans- 

 verse curved line, median and outer pair subequal, the inner pair 

 slightly longer and about equal to one and one-half times the width 

 of the prostomium. They are longer and more slender than those 

 of M . stylobranchiata and taper regularly to the end, being marked by 

 irregular, more or less conspicuous transverse wrinkles for the entire 

 length. Eyes one pair, inconspicuous and small, behind and external 

 to the base of the inner paired tentacles. 



Peristomium large, terete, swollen and furrowed laterally where 

 it is more than three times as long as somite II, which is simple and 

 apodous and about as long as the succeeding podous segments. No 

 nuchal cirri. Remaining segments foot-bearing, the first five or six 

 terete and narrow, after which they become wider and more depressed 




252 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [April, 



but not longer, those of the anterior branchial region being ten to 

 twelve times as wide as long, decidedly depressed and equally convex 

 dorsally and ventrally. The smaller specimen is widest at about the 

 posterior end of the anterior fourth and tapers thence caudad. Caudal 

 end and pygidium unknown. 



Parapodia begin on II at a low level and gradually rise to about XV, 

 where they occupy about a middle level. First four small, the others 

 of normal proportions and differing in no essential from those of M . 

 stylobranchiata, although the postsetal lobe is relatively broader (that 

 of IV is abnormally bifid). 



Gills when fully developed pectinate, consisting of a short basal 

 stem bearing from four to six slender, tapering, cross-wrinkled, crowded 

 filaments not exceeding a length of one-fifth of the body width and 

 none of which reaches the median line. On the type they begin at 

 XXXIII on the left side with two filaments and at XXXIV on the 

 right side with two filaments; three filaments occur on each side of 

 XXXVI; for the next fifteen segments four is the usual number of 

 filaments; between LV and LXV five is more frequent and thence to 

 LXXXV or LXXXVI the maximum number of five or six or rarely 

 even seven occurs ; behind this to the end of the piece all gills are quin- 

 quefid. On the smaller specimen the gills begin farther forward and 

 are much simpler. From XX or XXI to XXV they are simple, to 

 XLIV and LI bifid, thence to about XC mostly trifid, then again bifid 

 to CXXIV, and after that to the end of the piece they consist of a single 

 filament. 



Neuropodial acicula are simple, straight, tapered, blunt-pointed 

 spikes, black or nearly black to the tips. On anterior parapodia there 

 are four to six, with the tips little or not at all exposed and arranged 

 in an oblique series between the two tufts of setse. Farther back 

 on middle segments there are only three much stouter acicula, the 

 nearly black tips of which are conspicuously exposed. The cotype 

 has only two of the spinelike acicula on middle parapodia and in 

 addition a pale, more slender, bifid and hooded ventral crochet (PI. 

 VII, fig. 16), which is missing in all of the preparations made from the 

 type. 



Setse generally more prolonged than those of M. stylobranchiata. 

 Post-supra-acicular tuft very dense on anterior segments, consisting 

 of numerous curved, tapering alimbate setse (PI. VII, fig. 13), the 

 dorsal ones longer, more slender and colorless, the ventral shorter, 

 stouter and yellow. On these segments the pectinate setae are few 

 and difficult to see and bear numerous fine teeth (PI. VII, fig. 14a). 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 253 



Farther back the slender seta? become fewer and the pectinate setae 

 of two forms, the one like those on anterior segments, the other (fig. 

 146) with few coarse teeth. Compound setae have the distal end of 

 the stems somewhat coarsely toothed and the appendages very long, 

 slender and tapered, with scarcely visible marginal denticulation 

 (PI. VII, fig. 15) ; more dorsal appendages are fully twice as long as 

 the most ventral and all appendages become longer caudacl. 



Jaws deep brown, moderately hard but generally less massive than 

 those of M. stylobranchiata. Mandibles (PL VII, figs. 17, 18) of two 

 sides only slightly united, the carriers moderately divergent, long, 

 regularly tapered and rather rough; calcified end-plates small, irregu- 

 larly elliptical and coarsely toothed on the margin. Forceps jaws 

 (PL VIII, figs. 19, 20) with carriers of incompletely united halves, 

 quite as wide as long, broad and truncated at both ends and with a 

 deep lateral notch about the middle of each side. The forceps have 

 broad, strongly ridged hinge bases and edentulous masticatory plates, 

 the distal part being comparatively slender and not strongly hooked. 

 The second pair of maxilla? (II) are large and nearly symmetrical, 

 each bearing four or five large, stout, hooked teeth. The next plate 

 (III) is curved and much larger on the right, on which it bears seven 

 or eight blunt conical teeth, than on the left side which bears six. 

 In addition the right side bears a single small jaw, consisting of two 

 thin plates meeting in a thickened ridge (IV). On the left side is a 

 similar but smaller lateral jaw (V) and an internal curved plate bearing 

 about six marginal teeth (IV). 



Color anteriorly dull reddish purple marked with numerous small 

 white spots, the cuticle with a greenish iridescence. Posteriorly the 

 color is grayish with a pink tinge.

 July 7, 1905; and "picnic tables, 17-mile drive," June 29, 1904. 



This species is generally more slender than the next, the largest 

 example reaching a diameter of only 3 mm. The cuticle frequently 

 exhibits a beautiful greenish luster. Many of the specimens are 

 brown or purplish-brown with darker spots on the prostomium, 

 peristomium and on the sides of the setigerous segments; others are 

 conspicuously annulated with dark brown bands and others nearly 

 uniform in color. Those carefully studied have the seta? arranged in 

 some of the anterior parapodia ( V-XV) as follows : 3 or 4 large bilim- 

 bate dorsal seta?, 3 or 4 short hooded crochets in the middle and 3 

 small sigmoid bilimbate seta? below. The large maxillae commonly 

 bear four or five teeth. The caudal end tapers rapidly to a minute 

 tubular pygidium bearing a pair of closely approximated, very short, 

 thick, blunt cirri.

Unlike the last this species appears to be most abundant at San 

 Diego, where about forty specimens were taken in the littoral zone. 

 At Monterey Bay several were taken at "big tide pool," June 20, 1905, 

 and "Third Beach Point," July 6, 1905. 



The largest measure nearly 7 mm. in diameter. The prostomium 

 may be broad and obtuse or pointed. The posterior parapodia bear 

 very long erect lobes which are the distinguishing feature of this 

 species. The large maxilla? bear four teeth. Stalked infusoria are 

 frequently attached in the furrows between the parapodia. 

 Drilonereis nuda sp. nov. (Plate VIII, tigs. 21-23). 



Excessively elongated and filamentous and of nearly uniform 

 diameter. The three complete specimens in the collection are respec- 

 tively 327, 445 (type) and 630 mm. long, with 480, 652 and 935 segments, 

 the maximum width being 1.3 mm. and the depth 1 mm. 



Prostomium strongly depressed, about one-third as deep as broad 

 and nearly as broad as long in the type, but more extended in one 

 cotype, broadly rounded in front, slight median grooves extending

for most of the length of both dorsal and ventral faces. No eyes or 

 nuchal organs visible. 



Peristomium a simple ring, strictly terete and about one-half as 

 long as and slightly wider than the prostomium; its free ventral border 

 forming a furrowed lip bounding the large mouth. 



Somite II also achsetous, slightly smaller and more strongly convex 

 laterally, in the latter respect resembling the setigerous segments. 

 Body terete or with the venter slightly flattened, a little wider than 

 deep and with a more or less evident longitudinal parapodial furrow 

 along the sides. It is slightly enlarged in the middle and tapers gently 

 both ways, the posterior end being more slender. Setigerous segments 

 simple or when contracted faintly triannulate; anterior segments 

 one-third as long as wide, middle and posterior often as long as wide. 

 Pygidium a simple ring with vertical slit-like anus and no trace of cirri. 



Parapodia (PI. VIII, fig. 21) strictly lateral, minute, the posterior 

 ones slightly larger but never exceeding one-third the length of their 

 somites; all similar, consisting of a small rounded setigerous tubercle 

 and a small postsetal lobe slightly flattened and bent dorsad. 



Seta? few, varying from nine to eleven anteriorly and six or seven 

 posteriorly; all pale yellow and of one form (PI. VIII, fig. 22), some- 

 what geniculate, with the narrowly limbate end exhibiting a gentle 

 sigmoid curve. In the bundles they tend to separate into a dorsal 

 and a ventral group, the former including the somewhat larger number, 

 or into three groups, the dorsalmost of which is formed of one, two or 

 three setse having somewhat more prolonged tips than the others. 

 Anterior parapodia are supported by one or two stout acicula com- 

 pletely concealed within the body walls. At about XXV to XXX 

 the aciculum (or acicula) reaches the surface and projects as a stout 

 spine (or 2) ventral to the fascicle of setse (fig. 21), a condition that 

 continues to the caudal end. When two acicula are present one is 

 usually stouter and is accompanied by a minute delicate seta, probably 

 the tip of an undeveloped ordinary seta. 



Jaws when at rest and retracted in somites VIII to X. Although 

 the pharynx is lined throughout by a thick cuticle there is no trace of 

 mandibles in the two specimens dissected. Maxilla? (PI. VIII, fig. 23) 

 black, dense and very hard; the forceps jaws (I) broad at base, stout, 

 very strongly hooked at the end and lacking basal masticatory teeth ; 

 their paired filamentous carriers twice as long as the entire series of 

 jaws and distinct nearly to the anterior end, where they unite into a 

 small vertical plate bearing on its ventral margin an irregular hori- 

 zontal plate with ragged tendons for muscular attachment. Second

pair of maxillae (II) thick, triangular, curved plates bearing a thin 

 internal accessory plate or wing, and about five marginal teeth on the 

 left' and seven on the right side, the most anterior in each case being 

 strongly hooked and much the largest. The anterior pairs (III and IV) 

 are small plates with one very acute, erect, claw-like tooth, III, having 

 on the left side one and on the right side two additional small internal 

 cusps. On the left side there is also a minute V bearing two small 

 hooked teeth. 



Color brown, each somite sometimes with two dark rings which 

 may be concentrated in deep spots above the parapodia. Cuticle 

 with a brilliant green iridescence. 



The specimens were taken at a big tide pool near Monterey Bay, 

 the type on July 6, 1905, and the cotypes on June 20, 1905. 



STAURONERBIDJE. 

 Stauronereis moniloceras sp. now (Plate VIII, figs. 21-29). 



Form moderately slender, stoutest in pharyngeal region, thence 

 tapering regularly caudad; anterior end broadly rounded, strongly 

 arched above, flat below becoming rather more depressed posteriorly 

 but the dorsum remaining rather strongly arched. Maximum length 

 recorded 69 mm., width in pharyngeal region 3 mm.; number of seg- 

 ments up to 110. 



Prostomium subgloboid, not annulated, broadly shield-shaped in 

 outline, slightly longer than broad, slightly contracted toward the 

 posterior border which bears a small, median, rounded lobe united 

 with the median peristomial lobe. Ventrally a pair of conspicuous 

 palpal ridges separated by a deep cleft pass from the prostomium 

 into the mouth and terminate in pointed processes within the buccal 

 chamber. Dorsal tentacles arise from sides of prostomium just be- 

 hind the middle, are about one and one-half times as long as prosto- 

 mium, slightly curved and divided into about seven (6-8) short joints. 

 Very conspicuous palps arise from beneath the tentacles from enlarged 

 bases continuous with the palpal ridges and curve boldly back round 

 the sides of the mouth ; they are about one and one-half times as long 

 as the tentacles, rather strongly flattened proximally and undivided 

 except for a few transverse furrows along the concave side. Eyes 

 two pairs, black, conspicuous, rounded, the posterior dorsal and close 

 to the posterior border, the anterior dorso-lateral and just anterior to 

 base of tentacles. 



Peristomium enlarged and swollen, three times as wide as prosto- 

 mium, nearly twice as wide as long and about as long as three succeed- 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 257 



ing segments, uniannular, strongly convex and elevated above and 

 divided anteriorly into three lobes : a median united with the median 

 prostomial lobe and a prominent lateral pair which embraces the sides 

 of the prostomium as far forward as the tentacles. Nuchal organs 

 between these lobes and the prostomium, deep, quadrate, with fur- 

 rows passing from the angles. Mouth large with deeply furrowed 

 lips, cutting the peristomium nearly to its caudal border. 



Somite II a simple apodous ring one-third as long as the prosto- 

 mium. Succeeding segments podous, but otherwise similar to II. 

 Anteriorly they are one-eighth to one-sixth as long as wide, but become 

 one-fourth to one-third as wide in the middle and posterior region. 

 All perfectly simple with rounded, bulging sides and separated by 

 deep furrows ; a projection below each parapodium, combined with the 

 flattened venter, produces an almost sole-like surface. 



Pygidium an oblique ring with anus directed obliquely dorsad 

 and surrounded by a low welt. Caudal cirri two pairs, behind anus; 

 the more dorsal cylindrical, longer, about equaling diameter of 

 pygidium and formed of four or five articulations ; the more ventral 

 about one-half as long, clavate and formed of two articulations. 



Parapodia arise from a slight depression close to the ventral level 

 of the segments and project prominently directly laterad to a distance 

 of more than one-half width of body. They are uniramal, consisting 

 of a prominent neuropodium, compressed and somewhat expanded 

 distally where it is divided into a broad rounded postsetal lobe, a 

 shorter presetal lobe subdivided into two small secondary lobes and 

 a small subsetal lobe. In different regions the form of these lobes 

 varies somewhat and especially they become more pointed posteriorly. 

 Neurocirri arise from basal half of venter of neuropodium, and as a 

 simple conical or subcylindrical process reach nearly as far as its end. 

 Notocirri arise in contact with dorsal base of neuropodium and consist 

 of a long cylindrical cirrophore ciliated on its ventral side, probably 

 representing the notopodium, as it contains a slender aciculum or 

 rarely two acicula, and reaching beyond the end of the neuropodium 

 except on anterior segments; at its end it bears a conical style about 

 one-third its length. The first parapodium (on III) differs from all of 

 the others in its very small size, greater simplicity (being entire dis- 

 tally), in its short, rounded neurocirrus and especially in the total 

 absence of a notocirrus. 



Neuropodial aciculum always single, moderately stout, tapered, 

 straight, with a simple blunt point. Notopodial acicula, one, or 



17 




258 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



rarely two, very slender, almost fibre-like, tapered and reaching nearly 

 to tip of cirrophore. All acicula pale yellow. 



Setae perfectly colorless and vitreous, of two kinds: simple supra- 

 acicular and compound subacicular. The former (PL VIII, fig. 25) 

 number 15-20 on anterior parapodia, and become gradually fewer and 

 stouter posteriorly until they are reduced to a single rather stout one. 

 They are gently curved, slightly tapered and faintly fringed along 

 the convex side, and terminate rather abruptly in a small blunt hook 

 which is embraced between a pair of guards difficult to observe on 

 the more slender seta?, but sufficiently obvious on most of the stouter 

 ones. Compound setae form an oblique spreading tuft of twenty to 

 thirty on anterior and about one-half as many or even fewer on pos- 

 terior segments. The stems (fig. 24) are gently curved, slightly 

 enlarged and obliquely truncate distally, and just perceptibly den- 

 ticulated on the convexity. Appendages subtriangular, their length 

 two or three times the distal width of the shaft, tapered to the promi- 

 nently hooked tip, below which is a conspicuous accessory tooth, the 

 whole protected on one side by a very delicate, minutely denticulated 

 guard. 



The jaws of only one specimen were dissected. The smallest ones 

 are deep brown, the others black and opaque. Mandibles (fig. 26) are 

 heavy, with forcep-shaped bases and massive end-plates, the convex 

 margins and ends of which bear a series of blunt teeth and are much 

 broken with use; a thin chitinoid streamer containing two or three 

 black nodules is appended to the lateral side of the tip and the two 

 plates are lightly jointed medially. Maxillae form two long bands 

 extending through about eight segments and borne on the dorsal face 

 of a thick muscular pad. They are slightly united behind and each 

 consists of three series of denticles of about thirty-five or forty each, 

 besides a posterior tract where the separate denticles of each series 

 have coalesced. All free denticles have more or less deeply cleft 

 V-shaped bases, and those at the anterior end of each series are most 

 complex, hooked and slender. The inner series consists of small 

 denticles (figs. 29a and b), the anterior members of which have a pair 

 of long, subequal, acute teeth often flanked by smaller ones; passing 

 caudad the lateral teeth disappear and then one of the large teeth, 

 leaving a series of one-toothed plates that soon unite into a serrated 

 band. Jaws of the outer and middle series are much larger; the outer 

 ones (fig. 27) with strongly curved stems and several acute teeth 

 arranged asymmetrically near the end; several of the most anterior 

 are very slender, strongly falcate and nearly simple, but they soon 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 259 



become more complex and then more massive, with the lateral teeth 

 shorter and less distinct; finally they coalesce into a flexible band. 

 Those of the middle series (fig. 28) are generally similar to the outer, 

 but tend toward greater symmetry and undergo similar changes 

 caudally, where they tend to unite with the jaws of the outer series 

 as well as with one another. Sometimes the outer series is partly 

 deficient. 



The type is a female filled with large eggs and of a generally pale 

 color tinged with rich rusty yellow anteriorly. 



It was taken at Monterey Bay on June 20, 1905, by Mr. E. C. Starks. 

 Additional specimens were collected at the point above Third Beach, 

 vicinity of Monterey Bay, on July 12, 1904. 



This species resembles Anisoceras vittata Grube and Oersted some- 

 what closely, and more complete information regarding the latter, 

 which was taken at Punta Arenas, Costa Rica, may establish their 

 identity. It is, however, much larger than Oersted's specimens and 

 differs from Grube's description in several other respects.

 pp. 411, 412; PI. 10, figs. 104, 104a. 



San Diego, four specimens ; Monterey Bay, one at point above Third 

 Beach, July 12, 1904. 



An example 60 mm. long and 2.5 mm. in maximum width (exclusive 

 of the parapodia) in the anterior fourth tapers regularly to the caudal 

 end, and has 141 strongly biannulate segments which become relatively 

 longer caudad where the larger podous annulus may be again divided. 



The "head" consists of a wider basal two-fifths or more, consisting 

 of at least two segments bearing minute setigerous parapodia, the 

 peristomium and a portion of the prostomium. It includes the mouth, 

 which is bounded laterally by a pair of large, low pads. The anterior 




260 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Aprii, 



part is a short, somewhat depressed, rapidly tapered cone obscurely 

 divided into about eight rings and bearing at the apex two pairs of 

 small but distinct, slender, divergent tentacles. 



The parapodia agree with Johnson's figures; anteriorly they are 

 small, but gradually increase in length until the posterior ones become 

 quite prominent and slender. 



ARICIID^. 



Aricia johnsoni sp. nov. (Plate VIII, figs. 30-33). 



The solitary specimen upon which the following description is 

 based lacks perhaps about 100 caudal segments, the remaining 182 

 segments measuring 72 mm., and in the widest part of the anterior 

 region is 3 mm. wide and 1.8 mm. deep. 



Prostomium small, acutely conical, about twice as long as the basal 

 width, bearing at the apex a minute cirriform palpode, the base slightly 

 swollen and on the dorsal surface exhibiting an obscure transverse 

 row of minute specks, probably eye-spots. 



Peristomium a truncated cone nearly as long as the peristomium 

 and two to two and one-half times as broad ; on its venter is a quadrate, 

 cushion-like area, behind which the minute mouth lies between it and 

 somite II. 



Anterior region of body strongly depressed, elliptical in section and 

 scarcely two-thirds as deep as wide, increasing in width rapidly to X, 

 then more gradually to the widest point at XVIII or XIX, following 

 which is a rather marked constriction extending over about ten seg- 

 ments (those bearing the pectinated ventral folds). The entire pos- 

 terior region is very strongly convex below, flattened above, and bears 

 the parapodial lobes, setae and gills in a dense brush-like arrangement. 

 Intersegmental furrows well marked ; segments of anterior region one- 

 third to one-fifth as long as broad, obscurely biannulate owing to a 

 slight welt and groove encircling them opposite the parapodia; seg- 

 ments following region of ventral pectinations simple and much shorter. 

 Pygidium unknown. 



The ventral half of the welts alluded to above is better developed 

 than the dorsal half and bears the pectinated folds which are incipient, 

 as two or three small slender papillae, on each side of the neural line 

 of XXI and XXII. On XXIII they reach from the neuropodium to 

 the middle line, consisting of five or six closely contiguous smaller 

 papillae at the dorsal end and two or three larger detached papilla? at 

 the ventral end. On succeeding somites the number of papillae in- 

 creases to fifteen or sixteen on each side, all but the two or three ven- 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 261 



tralmost being in a close transverse series beginning immediately 

 beneath the neuropodia. On XXIX the papillae become fewer and 

 less crowded and the next three segments bear only two or three 

 detached papillae on each side immediately beneath the neuropodia, 

 the median area being bare. 



Parapodia of the anterior region are lateral and consist of low sloping 

 neuropodial platforms, bearing palisades of four to six rows of setae 

 backed by a low postsetal fold. In the neighborhood of XV, where 

 they are largest, they are about twice as deep as long, but anteriorly 

 the depth diminishes until it scarcely exceeds the length, while behind 

 XV they gradually decrease in both length and depth and in the pec- 

 tinated region shift dorsad to assume the form characteristic of the 

 posterior region at about XXII. Notopodia of anterior region incon- 

 spicuous spreading tufts of sessile setae immediately dorsad of the 

 neuropodia. When fully changed, beginning at XXIV, the parapodia 

 of the posterior region are strictly dorsal, borne with the gills on a 

 transverse fold. Each ramus consists of an elevated setigerous tubercle 

 bearing a small erect tuft of slender capillary setae and, in the case 

 of the neuropodium, a postsetal lobe divided into a minute conical 

 ventral part connected by a membrane to the side of the segment, 

 and a larger somewhat foliaceous dorsal part, while the postsetal lobe 

 of the notopodium is slightly foliaceous, sublanceolate and abruptly 

 bent at the base where it embraces the setae tuft. The only change 

 caudad is an increasing prominence for a time of the parapodia and a 

 progressive increase in length and slenderness of the notopodial post- 

 setal lobes. 



Gills begin on XX as a pair of minute papillae situated on the dorsum 

 and well separated from the notopodia. They increase in length 

 gradually and are fully developed only on segments following the 

 pectinated region, where they increase correspondingly to the growth 

 of the parapodia, but alway rise above the notopodial lobes as erect, 

 slightly flattened, lanceolate and ciliated processes close to the median 

 line and united with the opposite member of the pair by a low 

 membrane. 



No color remaining. Proboscis unknown. 



Notopodial setae of anterior region in spreading tufts, rather short, 

 tapered, flexible, capillary, with conspicuous subannular cameration 

 and along one side a small oblique opening into each chamber (PI. VIII, 

 fig. 32). In the posterior region they are straighter, much longer, 

 more slender and erect, and associated with the capillary setae in the 

 ventral part of middle and posterior bundles are a few very delicate 




262 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



bifurcate setse of peculiar form (fig. 33). They have the slender stem 

 with half-round collar flanges which appear in profile as marginal 

 serrations ; the end of each prong is expanded and slightly bilobed and 

 provided along the inner side with long oblique hairs. Anterior neuro- 

 podials form dense palisades of four to six series of chiefly short, blunt, 

 somewhat clavate, yellow spines, bent near the end and marked with 

 transverse serrullse at the convexity and with the tips enclosed in a 

 sheath (fig. 30). Those of the most caudal series of each palisade are 

 more slender and bear a slender, tapered, smooth tip ; and at the ven- 

 tral border of each is a small tuft of setse like the notopodials but 

 smaller. Neuropodial fascicles of the posterior region are small, com- 

 pact, erect and consist of a few very slender, straight setse (fig. 31) with 

 minute appressed teeth along one side. Setse all colorless. 



This species was taken at Moss Beach, near Monterey, Cal., on 

 July 7, 1905. It is probably the species mentioned as occurring 

 commonly on the California coast by Dr. H. P. Johnson, our leading 

 authority on the Polychseta of that region, to whom it is a pleasure 

 to dedicate it. The type is a female filled with large eggs. 



Naineris robusta sp. nov. (Plate VIII, figs. 34-37). 



Form generally similar to N. longa but decidedly stouter, tapered 

 both ways from the middle, the anterior end more depressed and 

 broadly rounded into the prostomium, the posterior region subterete, 

 strongly convex below, flattened above. The largest specimen is 

 170 mm. long and has a maximum diameter in the middle of the body 

 of 4 mm. ; from 26 to 30 segments constitute the anterior region and 

 as many as 360 the posterior region. 



Prostomium broad, flat, somewhat shovel-shaped, broadly rounded 

 and with a thin margin anteriorly; posteriorly somewhat narrower 

 and retracted within the peristomium; ventrally it is continued by 

 a somewhat swollen rugous area to the mouth and is united to the 

 anterior peristomial ring. No eyes; deep lateral recesses at the pro- 

 peristomial furrow represent the nuchal organs. 



Peristomium a somewhat indistinct naked ring about equaling II, 

 simple above, below split into two rings between the rugous folds 

 of which the mouth lies. 



Segments of anterior region about eight times as wide as long, con- 

 vex below, slightly concave above and about half as deep as wide. 

 Passing into the posterior region the segments become shorter (about 

 12 times as wide as long), much deeper, very convex below and nearly 

 flat above. No sharp boundary exists between the two regions, but 

 estimated, by the segment upon which conspicuous neuropodial setse 

 cease twenty-eight may be counted in the anterior region. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 263 



Pygidium a short tube with large terminal anus surrounded by a 

 membrane bearing a circle of minute papillae and a small but distinct 

 pair of ventral cirri knobbed at the ends. 



Parapodia begin on II. When fully developed at about X the 

 neuropodia consist of low fleshy projections at the extreme dorsal level 

 of the sides; they bear a scarcely evident presetal lobe and a more 

 prominent thick postsetal lobe which rises above into a free process 

 especially evident on the more restricted neuropodia of anterior and 

 posterior segments. Setae are of a deep brown color and form a con- 

 spicuous palisade of five or sometimes six vertical series arranged 

 in an elliptical area three times as deep (dorso-ventrally) as long 

 (antero-posteriorly) on middle segments, but less deep anteriorly 

 and posteriorly. In the posterior region neuropodia become reduced 

 to small pointed processes situated ventro-laterad of the notopodia, 

 with which they are united by an integumental fold ; they bear a tuft 

 of inconspicuous setae. Notopodia of anterior region dorsal, separated 

 from the neuropodia by a short interval and consisting of a short setig- 

 erous tubercle and a small but prominent postsetal lobe thickened 

 along the lateral border and rising mesially into a pointed process; 

 they bear small spreading tufts of setae of various lengths, the longest 

 directed mesially. Except that they become more elevated, the post- 

 setal lobes erect and sublanceolate in form and the setae reduced to 

 small vertical fascicles, the notopodia are little changed in the posterior 

 region. 



Branchiae appear at from VII to X as slender and inconspicuous pro- 

 cesses as long as the segment and arising from the dorsum just mediad 

 of the notopodia. No marked change is undergone until, passing 

 into the posterior region at about XXIX, they abruptly become much 

 longer, flattened and lanceolate, densely ciliated on both borders and 

 united to the notopodia by a membranous fold. They completely 

 fill the dorsal field between the notopodia and generally extend mediad 

 until they touch and bend sharply dorsad. They continue to the 

 posterior end. 



No clear distinction between acicula and setae exists, but some of 

 the latter reach deeply into the body walls and serve for muscular 

 attachment. On typical anterior neuropodia the stout, brown setae 

 form a conspicuous palisade of five (or rarely six) vertical rows which 

 bend backward and successively overlap. Those of the posterior 

 series (PI. VIII, fig. 34) are stouter than the others, with short, blunt 

 roughened tips; the others (fig. 35) are abruptly contracted imme- 

 diately beyond the surface of the body and taper into long, acute tips 




264 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



finely denticulated along one margin. There is also a small ventral 

 group, arranged in a few obliquely longitudinal rows, of slender 

 capillary setae denticulated and camerated like the notopodials. An- 

 teriorly these capillary setae increase in number, the tips of the stouter 

 setae lengthen and the rows become shorter, although remaining five. 

 Posteriorly the length of the rows again decreases and at about XXX 

 their number is abruptly reduced from five to three and the stout setae 

 quickly disappear, leaving only the ventral capillary setae. These 

 are colorless and exactly like the notopodials of the same region, except 

 that they are somewhat shorter and the fascicles more spreading. 

 They undergo little change throughout the posterior region, but on 

 middle and posterior segments six or eight small blunt spines appear 

 among their bases and probably represent the projecting ends of 

 acicula. Except that the tufts are larger and more spreading in the 

 anterior and more erect in the posterior region the capillary notopodial 

 setae do not differ. They are colorless, slender with much attenuated 

 tips, slightly curved and the distal half asymmetrically camerated 

 and finely denticulated along the convexity (fig. 36). A very small 

 number of bifurcate setae (fig. 37) are associated with the capillary 

 setae in the ventral part of the bundle, but they are- difficult to see and 

 appear to be absent from the anterior and many segments of the 

 posterior region. 



The protruded proboscis has the form of a rosette with ruffled 

 margins, the deepest folds dividing it into four lobes, each of which is 

 again subdivided into two, three or four much folded lobules. 



Color pale brown with neural and infrapodal series of spots, or 

 more extensively pigmented with dark brown. 



The type and two other examples, the former being an egg-bearing 

 female, were taken between tides at San Diego, and a single specimen 

 at Monterey Bay on June 20, 1905. 

 Naineris longa sp. nov. (Plate VIII, figs. 38-42). 



Form moderately slender; the anterior region slightly wider and 

 obscurely separated from the posterior by a slight constriction, rather 

 strongly depressed, flattened above; posterior region gently tapered 

 caudad, strongly convex below, flat above. Length up to 140 mm., 

 of which the anterior region is 16 mm. ; width and depth at caudal 

 end of anterior region respectively 3 mm. and 2.5 mm. Number of 

 segments of full-grown worms 290 to 310, of which 22 to 26 belong to 

 the anterior region. 



Prostomium broad, flat, about twice as wide as long; anterior border 

 gently convex and slightly upturned; ventral surface extended some- 




1909.1 NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 265 



what backwards to the mouth as a slightly rugous area; a few spots of 

 pigment but no distinct eyes on the dorsum. On each side at the 

 junction of prostomium and peristomium is a deep nuchal pit. 



Peristomium a distinct achaetous ring, longer than either prosto- 

 mium or somite II, simple and entire dorsally, but ventrally divided 

 nearly or quite to its posterior border by the large subtriangular mouth, 

 a small median process of II projecting slightly into the incision. 



Two regions of the body not sharply defined, distinguished chiefly 

 by differences in character of the notopodia and degree of develop- 

 ment of the gills. Segments of anterior region depressed, convex 

 below and flat above, distinct and sharply defined by well-marked 

 but not especially deep furrows, uniannular marked by a slight trans- 

 verse ridge ventrally and by a pair of faint impressed paramedian 

 longitudinal lines dorsally. Segments of posterior region short, at 

 first much crowded but farther back much less so, similar to those of 

 anterior region, but lacking the dorsal impressed lines and much more 

 strongly convex below. Caudal end depressed and broadly rounded, 

 ending in a short tubular pygidium with large anus directed slightly 

 upward and surrounded by a circle of papillae and a pair of minute 

 ventral cirri. 



Parapodia biramous, beginning on II and situated at a high level. 

 Neuropodia of anterior segments small, rather fleshy, elliptical sloping 

 prominences about as deep dorso-ventrally as long antero-posteriorly, 

 and produced into small rounded postsetal lobes which on more pos- 

 terior segments tend to be prolonged dorsad. They are largest on 

 the middle segments of the region and the three rows of stout setae 

 that they bear are here stoutest. Notopodia separated from neuro- 

 podia by a deep groove and consisting of small tubercles bearing 

 a slender tuft of capillary setae, behind and below which is a subcorneal, 

 erect postsetal lobe most prominent on anterior somites, and when 

 best developed bearing a convex wing on the ventral side of its base. 

 On posterior segments of this region the neuropodia become smaller 

 and shifted dorsad and the rami crowded. On the posterior region 

 both rami are borne on the dorsum and so closely approximated that 

 they seem almost to have a common somewhat elevated base. Both 

 rami are foliaceous, the neuropodium small and somewhat mammilli- 

 form bearing its setae in a fan-shaped fascicle; the notopodium con- 

 sisting of an erect, sub-lanceolate postsetal lobe and bearing a small 

 compact tuft of setae. 



Gills begin on from X to XII as slender, erect, conical processes on 

 the dorsum immediately above the notopodia. They undergo little 




266 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



change to the last two or three segments of the anterior region, where 

 they rather abruptly become longer and thicker. On anterior seg- 

 ments of the second region they extend transversely across the dorsum 

 from the notopodia and meet medially, but though continuing to the 

 posterior end they become gradually smaller. Each includes a single 

 vascular loop, and is heavily ciliated along the medial margin. 



Notopodial capillary setae (PI. VIII, fig. 40) appear to be similar 

 throughout — soft, slender, tapered, regularly and closely provided with 

 obscure, incomplete sheaths, corresponding to slight internal camera- 

 tion. The fascicles are slightly more spreading anteriorly, more com- 

 pact and erect posteriorly. At the base of the notopodials on the 

 ventral side of the tuft are three or four small and delicate bifurcate 

 setae (fig. 42) with serrated stems and slender tapered prongs bearing 

 a series of long oblique hairs. Neuropodials of the posterior region 

 are mostly similar to the notopodials, but the sculptured region is 

 shorter, and in addition there is a ventral series of about six small 

 smooth blunt spines (fig. 41). Anterior neuropodials are arranged in 

 three nearly vertical series, the first extending most ventral. All are 

 stout, but those of the anterior two rows (fig. 39) bear slender terminal 

 portions similar in structure to the notopodial setae but much more 

 abruptly tapered; those of the posterior series are stout, curved, 

 smooth, clavate spines (fig. 38). Ventral to the palisade is a cres- 

 centic series of smaller capillary setae. All of these setae are stoutest 

 in the middle and posterior parapodia of the anterior region, but on 

 the last few transition segments rapidly become more slender and the 

 series short and restricted from the ventral end. Or it may be said 

 that the three series of stout spinous setae gradually disappear, finally 

 leaving only the ventral group of slender setae with a few small spines. 



Proboscis partially protruded on several specimens. It appears to 

 consist of four principal divisions, each again bilobate and bearing 

 from four to ten slender elongated processes with a continuous hem- 

 like raised border, leaving a longitudinal groove on each. The lobes 

 are often irregular and unequal and some specimens appear to have 

 the proboscis divided into from five to eight fimbriated lobes. 



Color in alcohol dull creamy yellow, more or less marked with brown 

 pigment which is most constant as three series of ventral spots, a 

 subneural and paired infra-podal. Others have the gills or parapodia 

 pigmented and others the dorsum marked with suffused spots or well- 

 defined annulations, while extreme forms may be deep chocolate 

 brown. 



This species appears to be quite plentiful between tides in the

vicinity of Monterey Bay and was taken at Third Beach Point (which 

 is the type locality) on July 6, and at "big tide pool" on June 20. 

 A single example also occurs in the Starks collection from San Diego, 

 also taken between tides.

Cirratulus luxuriosus Moore, Id., pp. 493, 494; PI. XXXVIII, figs. 28-31. 



Both of these species are quite plentiful between tides on the beach 

 at San Diego. 



Tharyx multifilis sp. now (Plate IX, tig. 43). 



The type (a male) is 58 mm. long and has a maximum diameter at 

 the end of the anterior third of 2.1 mm. The segments number 240. 

 A female is slightly smaller and more slender. 



Prostomium (fig. 43) a short slightly depressed cone with a rather deep 

 ventral longitudinal groove and just anterior to it a transverse one. 

 No eyes visible, though there is a slight discoloration near the posterior 

 border. A pair of swellings behind and above mouth are the nuchal 

 organs, but there is no trace of appendages. 



Peristomium — probably representing three coalesced segments — 

 a large, swollen, apodous region about twice as wide and long as the 

 prostomium and marked with one or two partial furrows. Mouth 

 large, with smooth lips. 



Remaining segments setigerous, the anterior region about six 

 millimeters long, consisting of about sixty excessively short segments, 

 twelve to twenty times as wide as long, depressed and somewhat 

 widened. Behind this the 'body is nearly terete, slightly flattened 

 below and composed of longer, feebly separated segments about six 

 to eight times as long as wide. Segments all perfectly simple and 

 uniannular. The body increases in diameter through the anterior 

 third and then tapers gradually to the caudal end, terminated by a 

 minute pygidium with its central anus surrounded by a welt-like rim. 

 A narrow neural groove extends for the entire length and forks at the 

 peristomium to embrace the mouth. 



Parapodia consisting of minute setigerous notopodial and neuropodial 

 tubercles, the latter situated close to the ventral surface at the foot of 

 the strongly arched dorsum. Immediately above the first arises the 

 pair of large clavate tentacular cirri, which have a diameter nearly 




268 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



equal to the length of the prostomium and a length of nearly one- 

 third the body, grooved and crenulated for the entire length, narrow 

 at the base and becoming gradually thicker toward the distal end. 

 One specimen bears a pair of minute branchiae on this segment; on 

 the other they begin on the following segments. The branchiae are 

 very delicate extensile vascular filaments, which in all cages arise in 

 actual contact with the dorsal side of the notopodium. In perfect 

 specimens they probably occur on every segment except about twenty 

 at the caudal end, but in both of the two here described they are small 

 or absent on many of the middle ones. In the anterior depressed 

 region they are more firmly attached and longer than elsewhere, 

 occur regularly on every segment and form a crowded tangled mass. 



Setae perfectly simple, colorless, smooth, slender capillaries, forming 

 small, spreading, fan-shaped notopodial and neuropodial tufts; except 

 that the notopodials are longer than the neuropodials and the anterior 

 longer than the posterior they are all exactly alike, the longest equaling 

 one-half the body diameter. 



Color of male pale brownish, of female deep slate color. 



Since the type of the genus Heterocirrus has been shown to be an 

 epitokous phase of Dodecaceria, the next available name for such 

 forms as Heterocirris multibranchis and the present species is Tharyx 

 Webster and Benedict. 



Dodecaceria paoifica (Fewkes) (Plate IX, fig. 44). 



Sabella Pacified Fewkes, Bull. Essex Inst., XXI (1889), pp. 132, 133; 

 PI. VII, figs. 1, 2. 



More than a score of well-preserved examples of this species permit 

 of the preparation of a description more complete than the original. 



Usual length 30 to 40 mm., but sometimes extended to nearly twice 

 that length; maximum diameter about 1 mm.; number of segments 

 from 90 to 110. 



Body generally terete, usually slightly enlarged in the middle and 

 tapered a little each way, but often depressed and distinctly widened 

 at the posterior end; irregular enlargements and constrictions often 

 present at one or two other points. When depressed the venter is 

 flat, the dorsum convex. 



Prostomium and peristomium completely coalesced, together form- 

 ing a subcorneal head about one and one-half times as long as wide, 

 entirely without definite appendages, but with a pair of small dorsal 

 spots which probably represent the nuchal organs. The anterior 

 half, representing the prostomium, is a somewhat scoop-like, broadly 

 rounded lip deeply excavated below and overhanging the mouth, 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 269 



from the sides of which project a pair of small lobes probably repre- 

 senting palpi; these lobes and the ventral surface of the lip are pale, 

 in sharp contrast to the nearly black surface of the remainder of the 

 head. The posterior or peristomial half is a simple naked ring. 



Several of the immediately succeeding metastomial segments are 

 very short, but those following become gradually longer until they 

 are one-fourth or one-third as long as wide, but caudally they again 

 become very short and crowded and end in a simple pygidium with 

 rather large central anus. 



The first metastomial segment (II) bears a dorsal pair of simple 

 terete branchial filaments or notocirri which in extension are smooth 

 and three or four times as long as the head and in contraction trans- 

 versely wrinkled and much shorter ; ventral to these is a pair of usually 

 shorter and thicker neurocirri or prehensile tentacles which are grooved 

 along the ventral face and transversely wrinkled. The latter vary 

 much in length in different specimens, being in some less than the 

 diameter of the body, in others more than three times the diameter. 

 Notocirral branchiae also occur on from seven to ten next succeeding 

 segments (III to IX or XII). Of these the first three are commonly 

 larger than that on II, and because of the dorsal position of the latter 

 and the extreme shortness of the segments lie at successively lower 

 levels in a nearly vertical series; the fifth and succeeding pairs arise 

 immediately dorsal to the notopodial setse and on the same level as 

 the fourth pair. Specimens from the vicinity of Monterey Bay have 

 the fifth and rarely the sixth pair nearly as long as the more anterior, 

 but on those from San Diego they are always much shorter like the 

 remaining more caudal pairs, the last of which are usually mere 

 rudiments. 



Parapodia very small, lateral notopodial and ventro-lateral neuro- 

 podial tubercles separated by a small interval. Small tufts of notopodial 

 and neuropodial setse begin on II. On from eight to eleven segments 

 they are all slender, finely serrate setse, most numerous and longest in 

 the notopodia, in which they may be as long as their segment or longer. 

 At from IX to XII two stout yellow spines, bifid and hooked at the 

 end, appear in the neuropodium and a few segments caudad similar 

 ones in the notopodium. They may be accompanied by and alternate 

 with two or three minute capillary setse, but by about XX and all 

 through the middle region spines alone are present, from two to four 

 occurring in each fascicle and the neuropodial (PL IX, fig. 44) being 

 decidedly stouter with the terminal prong slightly hooked, flattened 

 and excavated. Notopodials straighter, less hooked and more flat- 




270 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



tened distally. In the posterior fourth the spines of both fascicles 

 become less stout, straighter and associated with capillary setse which 

 gradually increase in length and finally displace the spines altogether. 



In the preserved state these worms are perfectly opaque and of a 

 deep sooty black or sometimes a bluish black, especially deep and 

 uniform in the San Diego examples, but some of them become more 

 or less brown in the middle or anterior regions. Ventral face of 

 prostomium, groove of prehensile neurocirri and bases of branchial 

 notocirri pale. 



About fifteen examples were taken at Third Beach Point, vicinity 

 of Monterey Bay, on July 6, 1905, and about thirty at San Diego. 

 Most of these are mature and contain nearly ripe ova or sperm balls.

Terebella (Schmardanella) californica Moore, Proe. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila.,, 

 1904, pp. 496-498; PI. XXXVIII, figs. 36, 37. 



This species is quite plentiful at San Diego, living in burrows in the 

 beach at low water. Including the lot upon which the original descrip- 

 tion was based, about thirty specimens occur in the collection. Several 

 are packed full of eggs and some of them are much longer than the 

 type, reaching 130 mm. The number of setigerous segments varies 

 from 25 to 28.

A single example taken at San Diego is a female stuffed with eggs. 

 It is about 105 mm. long, the first eleven thoracic segments being 

 11 mm. long and equal to the greatest width of the thorax.

San Diego. A single small macerated Lanice probably represents 



this species, with the description of which it is in accord, except that 



the terminal twigs of the branchiae are fewer. 



Pista elongata sp. nov. (Plate IX, figs. 45-47). 



Form rather slender and elongated, clavate, the somewhat thickened 

 thorax followed by a constriction in the anterior abdominal region; 

 posteriorly gently tapered to the pygidium. Length 160-192 mm., 

 of which the thorax is 25-28 mm. ; diameter of thorax 5 mm. Number 

 of segments 176-240, 20 belonging to the thorax. 



Prostomium a prominent, stiff, broad and simply arched upper lip,. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 271 



behind which is the broad, tumid crescentic tentacular ridge, bearing 

 the very numerous tentacles in about eight transverse rows. 



Peristomium very short and obscure dorsally; ventrally prolonged 

 into a prominent scoop-like fold bearing a tumid lower lip and 

 produced laterally into a pair of rather prominent, broadly rounded 

 wings. Next three segments short, somewhat depressed, and branch- 

 iferous. A pair of prominent, rounded, lateral wings arise at a level 

 somewhat more dorsal than those on the peristomium and conceal 

 the greater part of the sides of II. Remaining thoracic somites are 

 much longer and subterete, 3 or 4 annulate, with prominent, glandular 

 parapodial areas and the dorsal and ventral fields much transversely 

 wrinkled. Ventral gland plates on II to XIII inclusive, but all rather 

 inconspicuous and the first especially small. Abdominal segments 

 very numerous, flattened and muscular below, arched and thin-walled 

 above. Pygidium annular with a brownish thickened rim bearing 

 a circle of about sixteen small, equal papillae surrounding the large 

 anus. 



Gills three pairs, on II, III and IV; except in one case all present 

 and well developed, symmetrical, usually decreasing in size from before 

 caudad, those of the middle pair arising at a slightly lower level than 

 the others. Owing to their great contractility they differ much 

 in form and appearance, but are strictly aborescent and more or less 

 open according to the degree of contraction. When fully extended 

 the stem is a smooth, tapering column having a length equaling or 

 exceeding the thoracic diameter and bearing at the summit four or 

 five main branches, each of which again divides about six times and 

 terminates in slender tapered filaments. The plan of division is 

 dichotomous but irregularities are numerous, and although the trunk 

 cannot be traced through the crown, one branch of a pair is usually 

 larger than the other and frequently a single long tapering filament 

 occurs opposite the point of origin of a branch of any order. When 

 contracted the branches appear short and cylindrical, with the fila- 

 ments in crowded terminal tufts. The latter are readily detached and 

 regenerated. 



Setigerous tubercles begin on IV and continue for seventeen seg- 

 ments or to XX. They are large, prominent, well separated from 

 the tori, somewhat flattened and bear broad fascicles of seta?. The 

 first pair (on IV) are smaller, and small papilliform cirri occur behind 

 the setigerous tubercles of VI to X inclusive. Uncinigerous tori 

 well marked and regular, retractile ridges separated from the setiger- 

 ous tubercles by an interval exceeding the diameter of the latter. 




272 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



The first six (V-X) with uncini in one row and having a length of 

 about twice the segment bearing them, the others with uncini in two 

 interlocking series and at first abruptly much longer, but the caudal 

 three or four again shorter and shifting on to the venter behind the 

 ventral plates. Abdominal tori small but prominent, latero- ventral 

 lappets bearing a single series of uncini sunken below a raised border 

 and terminating dorsally in a short cirrus-like projection. 



Setae pale yellow, numerous, arranged in two ranks in broad fas- 

 cicles, those of one rank shorter, but all rather long, tapered, acute, 

 bilimbate with rather broad but not extensive margins and entire, 

 unfringed tips. 



Uncini deep yellow on thorax, paler on abdomen. On first six 

 thoracic and all abdominal tori in a single series pointing forward, on 

 XI to XX in double interlocking series. About 40 on V to VII, 50 on 

 VIII-X, 80-85 on XI to XV and 50-60 on XVI to XX. Anterior 

 abdominal tori bear about 70 uncini. On somites V, VI and VII they 

 are large, with long tapered handle-like bases (PI. IX, fig. 45) and a 

 prominent anterior projection for muscular attachment; the beak is 

 long and nearly straight, the crest composed of a single transverse 

 series of large teeth and the guard large. These characters are most 

 pronounced on V and gradually decline on VI and VII. On VIII 

 to X the uncini are transitional to the typical form (PL IX, fig. 46), 

 which on the posterior thoracic somites has the manubrium much 

 reduced and chiefly replaced by a thin, translucent, ligamentous 

 expansion, the base short and triangular, the beak strongly hooked, 

 short and stout and the crest more elevated and composed of about 

 three transverse series of teeth of diminishing size. Abdominal 

 uncini (PL IX, fig. 47) still smaller with reduced convex bodies, acute, 

 strongly hooked beak, high crest composed of numerous teeth and 

 long filamentous anterior and posterior ligaments. 



Color in alcohol uniform dark brown. 



This species is founded on four specimens taken between tides at 

 San Diego by E. C. Starks. It differs from the Alaskan species pro- 

 visionally referred to P. fasciata in the much greater length and more 

 numerous abdominal segments, in the smaller lateral wings, the 

 absence of a post-branchial fold and especially in the form of the 

 branchiae. It is closely related to the Japanese species P. maculata 

 Marenzeller which has a similarly elongated body, three pairs of simi- 

 larly branched gills and uncini of similar form. The principal dis- 

 tinctions are that the latter has larger and more numerous ventral 

 plates and no distinct second pair of lateral wings. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 273 



Pista (Scionopsis) alata sp. nor. (Plate IX, figs. 48-51). 



Form moderately stout, widest and somewhat depressed anteriorly, 

 tapered regularly to caudal end. Length of type 63 mm., maximum 

 width at X 9 mm. Number of segments 94, in addition to a few 

 scarcely differentiated ones at the caudal end. 



Prostomium rather small but prominent, thickened, arched, its 

 sides continued ventrad to nearly enclose the mouth, below which 

 they end in a pair of short, thick lobes each bounded laterally by a 

 slight indentation. Tentaculiferous ridge low and thick, bearing- 

 numerous tentacles arranged in a single transverse row in the medial 

 and in two transverse rows in the lateral part. Tentacles numerous, 

 rather short and thick, very slightly attached by a contracted base 

 and deeply grooved or folded for most of their length. Many of the 

 dorsalmost ones are short and imperfectly developed. 



Peristomium and two or three immediately following segments 

 short, contracted and terete. Peristomium produced into a promi- 

 nent ventral fold with a deep median emargination, on each side of 

 which it spreads laterally as a great flaring wing reaching dorsally to 

 the level of the setigerous tubercles. Somites II and III are distinct 

 dorsally and ventrally but confounded laterally. The anterior margin 

 of the former is produced on the ventral surface as a slight fold. 

 Beginning at the sides of the ventral plate of III is a pair of conspicuous 

 wings which extend obliquely up the sides of III and the anterior 

 margin of IV and which are united across the dorsum of the latter by a 

 transverse fold bearing a prominent median forward projection. 



Posterior to the branchial region the thoracic segments develop 

 prominent glandular thickenings along the parapodial field, as a result 

 of which they are wider than deep. Behind X the thoracic region 

 tapers into the abdomen, the transition into which is somewhat abrupt. 

 Ambulation of the somites is obscure, only the posterior thoracic and 

 anterior abdominal showing faint indications of subdivisions. There 

 are fourteen well-marked ventral plates, the first on III, the last on 

 XVI, behind which more obscure wrinkled and subdivided areas 

 continue to the end of the thorax. The first five are short, about 

 four or five times as wide as long. The others are very smooth, 

 apparently very vascular and probably deep red in life, the relative 

 width gradually increasing from equality to the length to double it, 

 the greatest width in all cases being anterior, so that the entire series 

 appears serrated laterally. By the sides of each is a pair of rough 

 glandular areas which posterior to XVI become united with the gland- 

 ular ventral areas, giving them an irregular polygonal outline and 

 18 




274 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



roughened surface. Slight traces of similar structures continue on 

 to a few anterior abdominal segments. Middle and posterior abdomi- 

 nal segments are marked about the middle in the parapodial zone by a 

 distinct, elevated, glandular ring, the remainder of the body wall being 

 relatively thin and translucent. Pygidium slightly expanded and 

 bent dorsad, the large anus surrounded by a raised border. 



Branchiae two pairs, on somites II and III, when contracted par- 

 tially protected by the lateral wings and dorsal fold. As in Scionopsis 

 pahnata Verrill they are very unequally, asymmetrically and irregu- 

 larly developed. Both specimens have all four present. On the type 

 the right anterior is much the largest and situated exactly in the median 

 line, the left anterior is very small; those of the posterior pair are 

 symmetrical in position and close to the median line, and intermediate 

 in size between those of the anterior pair, that of the left side being 

 slightly larger. The cotype has the anterior left largest, then the 

 posterior right, the posterior left and the anterior right quite small. 

 The well-developed branchiae consist of a rather tall, column-like 

 trunk which at once divides into several (3 to 5) main limbs which 

 diverge and spread more or less horizontally. Each main limb consists 

 of a tapering, strongly zigzag axis which may be traced to the tip and 

 gives rise at each bend to similar lateral branches which also spread 

 horizontally and divide into branches of the third order. Most of the 

 latter bear two to six slender filaments which occasionally bifurcate 

 or divide even farther and are usually (but not always) confined to 

 one side of the branch. Thus is produced a very beautiful and charac- 

 teristic plume-like structure more or less complexly branched according 

 to the size of the gill and having nearly the form of a branch of certain 

 species of the plant Selaginella. The main divisions of the large gill of 

 the type specimen spread symmetrically and are so large that the 

 second pair of gills is completely concealed beneath their posterior 

 limbs, although these are much shorter than the anterior limbs. 



Setigerous tubercles occur on somites IV to XX inclusive, separated 

 from the uncinigerous tori by a slight interval and nearly in line with 

 them. They are nearly cylindrical but somewhat compressed antero- 

 posteriorly. Thoracic uncinigerous tori begin on V and are raised on 

 thickened glandular areas. The first two are longer than the others 

 which are of nearly uniform length. Nephridial papillae exist above 

 those of VII to XVI at least. Abdominal tori are small but prominent 

 and decrease in vertical extent caudad. All are distinctly bilobate, 

 having the angles, especially the dorsal angle, produced, bent forward 

 and free from uncini. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 275 



Setse in prominent flattened fascicles, arranged in two series of 

 about fourteen to sixteen each, those of the anterior row about one- 

 half as long as those of the other. Rather stout (PL IX, fig. 48), pale 

 yellow, slightly curved and tapered to an acute tip, bilimbate with 

 well-marked, lanceolate, entire but striated blades rather wider on 

 the convex side. Uncini in single series pointing forward on somites 

 V to X and on all abdominal somites, in double interlocking series 

 on somites XI to XX, 105 on V, 98 more crowded on VII, and about 

 65 in each row on XII. On abdominal tori their number decreases 

 from before caudad, there being 32 on XXI, 25 on XXXV, etc. Uncini 

 of somites V to VII (PL IX, fig. 49) have the base prolonged into a 

 slender manubrium with a thin membranous border and a prominent 

 anterior angle, the beak is long and slender and the low crest formed 

 of a few large teeth; guard slightly developed. On somites VIII to 

 X the manubrium becomes gradually reduced and the remaining 

 thoracic tori bear uncini of the form shown in fig. 50, which have 

 the base short, without a manubrium, convex below, with slender 

 ligament, well developed guard, stout beak, and high crest of several 

 transverse rows of teeth. Abdominal uncini (fig. 51) are small, with 

 short base convex below and provided with slender anterior and 

 posterior ligaments, no guard and beak and crest nearly as in posterior 

 thoracic uncini. 



The color has faded, but in life is probably chiefly translucent green 

 or olive green, with scattered flakes of white and deep red blood spots 

 behind the ventral plates and below the setigerous tubercles. 



Type locality, San Diego; E. C. Starks, collector. Two specimens, 

 the type a female filled with large eggs. 



Thelepus crispus Johnson. 



Thelepus crispus Johnson, Proc. Bos. Soc. Nat. Hist., XXIX, p. 428; PI. 17, 

 figs. 175-1786. 



Common at both San Diego and Monterey; at the former between 

 tides and at the latter above and below low water. At Monterey Bay 

 specimens were taken at "big tide pool," June 28, 1904, point above 

 Third Beach, July 12, 1904, and dredged at Delmonte wharf, same date. 



Young and half-grown examples possess numerous eyes, but full- 

 grown ones are nearly or quite eyeless. All specimens examined by 

 me have the deep end of the uncini narrower than in Johnson 's figure 

 and the knob terminal with no projection beyond it. The uncini 

 differ constantly from those of T. hamatus in the prominence of the 

 large crest teeth, while the row of smaller apical teeth is very little 

 developed or absent. Those of T. hamatus, on the contrary, have 




276 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



the crest teeth less prominent but more numerous and subdivided. 

 The tubes resemble those of T. cincinnatus ; sometimes they are covered 

 with shell sand. 



Polycirrus sp. ? (Plate IX, fig. 54). 



A much macerated Polycirrus, dredged at Delmonte wharf, Monterey 

 Bay, on July 12, 1904, has uncini very closely resembling those of P. 

 aurantiacus (Grube) Malmgren, but is too imperfect for description. 



Polycirrus califomicus sp. nov. (Plate IX, figs. 52, 53). 



The type is 28 mm. long, about 1.5 mm. in maximum diameter and 

 has 65 segments, 28 of which are setigerous. 



Prostomium large, projecting far forward as a long, narrow, highly 

 arched lobe shaped much like the inverted bowl of a spoon, about 

 twice as long as wide and equaling the first four segments. No eyes. 

 Tentacles very numerous, forming a densely tangled mass which 

 conceals much of the anterior end of the body, of two kinds, one very 

 slender and delicate, slightly enlarged distally and arising from a pair 

 of lateral areas, the other stouter with thin marginal expansions and 

 arising from a transverse band near the anterior border of the 

 tentaculiferous area. 



Peristomium a short, simple ring bounding the mouth; other seg- 

 ments varying in size with the degree of distention of the ccelom, the 

 anterior ones faintly biannulate and the intersegmental furrows usually 

 rather obscure; dorsum smooth and strongly arched, a longitudinal 

 furrow immediately above the setigerous tubercles. Venter with a 

 deep neural groove bounded by prominent lateral muscular ridges 

 supporting the parapodia. 



First ventral plate entire, equilaterally triangular, the apex forward, 

 extending the entire length of the peristomium and somite II, followed 

 by eight short, oblong, ventral plates, each divided into equal quadrate 

 halves by the deep neural groove, the first five reaching the full length 

 of somites III to VII, the remaining three on segments VII to X being 

 reduced in size. 



The last ten or twelve segments taper very rapidly to a minute 

 simple pygidium. Coelom packed full of small eggs. 



Setigerous tubercles begin on II and continue to XXIX (inclusive). 

 They are small, project dorsad and laterad and bear small fan-shaped 

 fascicles of delicate colorless setse arranged in pairs of a small simply 

 capillary setse and a longer limbate one. After about XX the fas- 

 cicles become much smaller and inconspicuous. Tori begin on XIV, 

 at least no trace of uncini can be detected anterior to this segment. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 277 



At first they are long, narrow ridges reaching nearly to the middle 

 line and bearing a single series of about sixty uncini. Posterior to the 

 setigerous region the tori are shorter and thicker and bear only about 

 forty uncini. 



Uncini are small and delicate, the base with prominent posterior 

 angle, the rostrum slender and acute and about half as long as the 

 base, crest with two large profile teeth. Anterior uncini (PL IX, 

 fig. 52) have the base less produced and blunter in front than those 

 from posterior tori (PI. IX, fig. 53). 



The uncini closely resemble those of P. nervosus v. Marenzeller, 

 but the latter has thirty-two setigerous segments and differs in the 

 character of the tentacles, the ventral plates and other features. 



Besides the type there is one additional incomplete specimen, both 

 having been taken at San Diego.

A single specimen taken at Delmonte wharf, in the vicinity of 

 Monterey Bay, on July 12, 1904, agrees with Johnson's description. 

 The tube is constructed of coarse sand grains. 



OAPITELLID^J. 

 Notomastus tenuis sp. nov. (Plate IX, fig. 55). 



A slender elongated worm, the single example of which is macerated 

 in the middle but well preserved at the ends. The two pieces prob- 

 ably represent a nearly or quite complete worm which is 118 mm. 

 long and .8 mm. in diameter. Thoracic segments number 12 and 

 abdominal 191. The thorax of 12 segments is clavate, the anterior 

 half thickened, the posterior gradually narrowed, the abdomen 

 abruptly expanded to equal the maximum width of the thorax, then 

 tapering gently to the pygidium. 



Prostomium conical, pointed, with a few specks of pigment scattered 

 along the sides; when retracted somewhat inflated and completely 

 closing the mouth. 



Peristomium simple, achsetous. Thorax clavate, terete, smooth 

 and scarcely iridescent, the intersegmental furrows faint; widest seg- 

 ment about two-fifths as long as wide, narrowest two-thirds as wide 

 as long, most of them equally and obscurely biannulate, the inter- 

 annular furrow with a backward bend or inset into the succeeding one 

 at the position, 7 of , the lateral organs. Neuropodia and notopodia 




278 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



represented by small linear depressed tufts of capillary setae, the 

 notopoclial setse fewer and less crowded. 



Anterior and posterior abdominal segments are relatively short 

 (one-half to two-thirds as long as wide) and separated by deep inter- 

 segmental furrows; in the middle macerated region the segments are 

 stretched to about twice their diameter. Except at the posterior end, 

 where the segments are somewhat angulated, the body is terete. 

 Pygidium (possibly regenerated) a simple, short, subcorneal ring. 



No gills, genital pores, or lateral sense organs are visible. 



Abdominal tori are short and scarcely visible. The anterior noto- 

 podia bear about ten and the posterior about six crochets, while 

 anterior neuropodia have 16-18 and posterior neuropodia about 10 

 crochets. 



Crochets (PI. IX, fig. 55) very small and all alike, with a distinct 

 shoulder and a swelling neck bearing a very small head enclosed in a 

 large hood.

 1 mm. diameter. 



Prostomium a minute blunt palpode bearing a pair of nuchal organs. 



Peristomium a truncate, subcorneal, smooth segment slightly longer 

 than somite II and somewhat constricted about the middle. A pair 

 of small spots probably represent openings of the lateral organs. 



The thorax consists of seventeen setigerous segments in addition 

 to the peristomium, terete, of nearly uniform diameter, slightly con- 

 tracted toward the posterior end, very smooth and with faint and 

 often obsolete intersegmental furrows. All of these segments bear 

 small notopodial and neuropodial tufts of setse, the former separated 

 by a distance slightly greater than the latter. A very faint depressed 

 spot on each side of the segment somewhat nearer to the notopodia 

 than the neuropodia seems to be the orifice of the lateral organ; and 

 almost equally obscure pores at the same level and in most of the 

 posterior intersegmental furrows may be genital orifices. 



Anterior abdominal segments scarcely differ from the thoracic, 

 being similar in shape and proportions but less polished and iridescent, 

 farther back they become longer but remain smooth and ill-defined. 

 The largest number of abdominal segments on any one piece is ninety- 

 five. Abdominal neuropodia form distinct ventro-lateral tori, some- 

 what elevated and glandular, connected ventrally only by a glandular

line and bearing a series of crochets extending over about one-sixth 

 of the body circumference. Notopodia similar but smaller, the first 

 bearing capillary setse, the others crochets. Number of neuropodial 

 crochets on XIX 12-14, on XXV 32, notopodials on XXV 16. 



Posterior abdominal segments bear rather conspicuous tufted 

 dorsal gills, each consisting of eight or ten short filaments arising 

 close together from the posterior margin of the segment in line with 

 the notopodia. The most anterior of these gills are small and some- 

 what pectinate, farther back they increase in size until the filaments 

 have a length of one-third to one-half the diameter of the segments. 



All setae are of the usual limbate, capillary form with very slender 

 tips. The crochets (PI. IX, fig. 56) have a distinct shoulder, a neck 

 that gradually increases in diameter to a rather large head with stout 

 beak and high crest enclosed in a short but much inflated hood. 



Each of the specimens is enveloped in a thin membranous tube 

 covered by a single layer of loosely attached sand grains. 



Taken only at San Diego at low water by E. C. Starks; four speci- 

 mens. 



As both this species and the type of Eunotomastus are known from 

 incomplete specimens it is by no means certain that E. gordiodes 

 is correctly referred to this genus. 



Dasybranchus giganteus (Moore) (Plate IX, fig. 57). 



Notomastus giganteus Moore, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1906, pp. 227, 

 228; PI. X, figs. 24, 25. 



Specimens in this collection much better preserved than the type 

 enable me to correct and amplify the original description and to correct 

 the generic reference. The stout form and large size are of course 

 not at all noteworthy in the genus to which the worm is now referred. 



Prostomium much retracted so that the tip alone is visible. Pro- 

 truded proboscis subglobular, bulbous, with a rosette-like end pre- 

 senting eight sulcated radiating lobes and proximad to this a closely 

 granulated basal ring. 



All six specimens have twelve thoracic segments. Peristomium 

 about as long as succeeding segments, achsetous and biannulate. 

 Remaining thoracic segments setigerous, strongly biannulated and 

 areolated on the surface. Notopodial and neuropodial fascicles both 

 simple linear tufts borne on the posterior ring just behind a tenon- 

 like inset of the anterior ring. Except on the first two or three setiger- 

 ous segments the neuropodial fascicles are nearly twice as wide as the 

 notopodial and separated by a ventral interval of nearly one-half 

 the body diameter, the inter-ramal interval being slightly more than 




280 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



the inter-notopodial interval on anterior segments and nearly twice 

 as great on XII. 



Abdominal segments about half as long as thoracic, usually irregu- 

 larly biannulate, thickly glandular anteriorly but (except at the tori) 

 becoming thin-walled posteriorly. Neuropodial tori extensive low 

 ridges, reaching on anterior segments from above the middle level 

 nearly to the neural line, but posteriorly scarcely half as long. They 

 become more elevated dorsally and end abruptly in a prominence, 

 above which is the small but distinct rounded ovoid lateral organ. 

 The very small notopodial tori are dorsal and connected across the 

 dorsum by a low transverse fold. Posteriorly they become very 

 obscure. 



Branchiae are retractile and usually obscure anteriorly; on middle 

 and posterior abdominal segments they become conspicuous bushy 

 tufts composed of numerous (about 20-30) filaments arising from 

 the posterior end of the notopodial tori, or posteriorly, where the tori 

 become obsolete, replacing them. 



Abdominal lateral organs are distinct only posteriorly where the 

 tori become widely separated, appearing halfway between them as 

 small rounded elevations, above and below which a few small papillae are 

 scattered. Thoracic lateral organs and genital pores were not observed. 



The original drawings of crochets of this species were made from 

 imperfect specimens and a corrected representation is shown in fig. 57, 

 Plate IX. 



Six specimens of this species, one of which is 6 mm. in diameter, 

 occur in the Starks collection and were taken at San Diego between 

 tides. 



Dasybranchus glabrus sp. nov. (Plate IX. fig. 58). 



Body moderately stout, terete, and thickest anteriorly where it is 

 shaped much like a small earthworm; posteriorly more slender and 

 gently tapered, subquadrate, flattened below. The type and only 

 specimen is 45 mm. long with a maximum diameter of 2.4 mm. 

 Thoracic segments 14, abdominal 157. 



Prostomium partially retracted within the collar-like anterior 

 border of the peristomium, the exposed part bluntly rounded anter- 

 iorly with a slight ventral longitudinal furrow. 



Peristomium a long, deeply biannulate segment (perhaps two seg- 

 ments) as long as any two of those following; the first ring is marked 

 by several shallow furrows. Entire thorax with firm, smooth, thickly 

 glandular walls, with very few markings; the segments all uniannulate 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 281 



and separated by deep intersegmental furrows. Thoracic notopodia 

 and neuropodia bear short, equal, retractile linear tufts of setae, the 

 neuropodia being about twice as far apart as the notopodia and the 

 distance between the latter about equaling the interramal space. 

 Lateral sense organs quite evident, slit-like pores near the caudal 

 border of the segments and nearer to the notopodia than the neuro- 

 podia. 



Abdominal segments very short and much crowded, especially 

 toward the anterior end; posteriorly they are obscurely biannulate 

 and less crowded. Anterior abdominal segments are terete and have 

 thick glandular walls much like the thoracic segments; farther back 

 the walls become thinner and non-glandular and except in the region 

 of the tori the surface is granular, and, chiefly owing to the separation 

 of the tori dorsally and ventrally, the section becomes subquadrate. 

 Anterior abdominal segments have no distinct tori, but bear a con- 

 tinuous line of sessile crochets which appear to completely encircle 

 the segment at the middle. After about the twelfth abdominal seg- 

 ment a slight lateral or interramal break appears and gradually widens 

 until the notopodia and neuropodia become well separated and distinct 

 tori. The neuropodia of each pair remain, however, continuous 

 across the neural surface, but except on a few anterior segments the 

 notopodia are discontinuous and posteriorly become separated quite 

 widely. Lateral sense organs are obscure on anterior abdominal 

 segments, but on middle and posterior segments become distinct though 

 small rounded eminences. Pygidium probably injured as it is divided 

 into several very irregular lobes. 



Gills appear only in the posterior half of the body, usually as two, 

 or sometimes three, short, hollow, sausage-shaped filaments issuing 

 from a pore immediately dorsal to the neuropodium. 



Thoracic setae are exclusively of the usual tapering capillary form 

 with narrowly bilimbate ends. Abdominal segments bear exclusively 

 very numerous crochets of one form in both notopodia and neuropodia 

 (PI. IX, fig. 58). They are slender without a distinct shoulder, but 

 with a subterminal enlargement that tapers to a small head with 

 hooked beak and three small teeth in the vertex of the crest, the end 

 enclosed in a somewhat inflated hood. 



The type was taken at San Diego Bay in December, 1902. 



This species differs from typical members of the genus in having 

 two more than the usual number of thoracic segments.

This species occurs in the collections from San Diego only, but 

 appears to be quite common there. 



One bottle contains, along with a specimen of this annelid, a small 

 amphipod determined by Prof. S. J. Holmes as Melita sp. which the 

 label states lives commensally in its tube. From M. biceps, to which 

 it is most nearly related, this species is readily distinguished by 

 having more numerous and blunter teeth on the anterior division of 

 the cephalic limbus, the last preanal segment uniannulate instead of 

 biannulate, and the emargination on the ventral division of the caudal 

 funnel entire instead of emarginated and slightly lobate. The fringed 

 setse are of the bispiral type.

A single example from San Diego. It is a beautifully preserved 

 specimen 30 mm. long, with 22 setigerous segments. A fragment of 

 a tube is formed entirely of particles of shells. 



Sclerocheilus pacificus sp. nov. (Plate IX, fig. 59). 



Form as in Scalibregma, clavate, the posterior two-thirds slender 

 and of nearly uniform diameter but tapering slightly caudad; the 

 anterior one-third abruptly swollen to three times the posterior 

 diameter. Length 25-35 mm., maximum diameter 2.5-3.6 mm. 

 Segments 60-72. 



Prostomium depressed T-shaped, the basal part about as broad 

 as long and nearly half as wide as the peristomium, into which it is 

 deeply retracted. Antero-lateral limbs blunt projections each about 

 half as long as the width of the body of the prostomium. On each 

 side of the posterior dorsal region is a broad, black oblique streak 

 which appears to be constituted of two parallel rows of small pigment 

 specks. At their anterior ends they are separated by one-half the 

 width of the body of the prostomium, but diverge as they pass back- 

 ward beneath the peristomial fold apparently into the nuchal organs. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 283 



Peristomium a short, simple, unsculptured ring incomplete ventrally 

 where it reaches the sides of the mouth. Somite II also a simple ring, 

 but bearing lateral parapodia and bounding the mouth behind. Suc- 

 ceeding somites increase in diameter and become rapidly inflated; 

 III, IV and V are biannulate, with the larger setigerous annulus 

 posterior, the smaller annulus apparently arising in the intersegmental 

 furrow; VI and succeeding somites of the anterior region have the 

 setigerous annulus divided equally by a furrow that appears just 

 behind the setae. Each of the three rings thus formed is divided by 

 short deep furrows into a ring of tessellse or subquadrate areas which 

 are much more conspicuous on the dorsum than on the venter. In 

 the posterior region the interannular furrows become very faint or 

 completely disappear, leaving well-marked simple segments, generally 

 about one-fourth or one-fifth as long as wide and only very obscurely 

 areolated. 



Pygidium a simple, slightly oblique ring which bears no cirri on 

 either the type or cotype. Body walls very thin and readily ruptured. 

 Proboscis partly everted as a smooth broadly trilobed disk. 



Parapodia merely obscure lateral swellings involving the entire 

 length of the somites in the anterior enlarged region and bearing the 

 two well-separated linear tufts of seta? opposite to the middle annulus. 

 Apparently there are no cirri, unless the minute knobs related to the 

 setse fascicles prove to be such. Gills are totally absent. 



Setse colorless with a faint bluish luster, chiefly capillary, of various 

 lengths, curved and slightly flattened distally. Anteriorly they are 

 most conspicuous, forming fan-shaped tufts with linear bases, the 

 neuropodial more spreading, the notopodial longer and curved dorsad; 

 the longest setse about as long as the segment. Posteriorly the setse 

 are fewer and less slender. Short inconspicuous furcate setse (fig. 59) 

 are paired with the capillary setse on all except a few anterior segments 

 on which they cannot be seen. There are no stout setse on II. 



The type, a mature male, and a smaller cotype were taken at Third 

 Beach Point, vicinity of Monterey Bay, by Mr. Spaulding on July 

 6, 1905. 



This species as described differs widely from the type of the genus, 

 especially in the absence of stout setse on II and the absence of neuro- 

 cirri, though it is possible that the latter, like the caudal cirri, may be 

 easily detached. On the other hand the absence of gills and the pres- 

 ence of eye-spots are characters which approximate it to the type, 

 S. minutus Grube. This species would also seem to indicate that the 

 creation of Asclerocheilus as a separate genus is unnecessary.

 Brada sp. ? juv. 



Two small specimens dredged at a depth of forty feet at San Diego 

 are considered to be the young of a species of Brada or possibly of a 

 Trophonia in which the anterior setse have not yet elongated. They 

 are about one-half inch long, clavate, with well-marked, simple seg- 

 ments, a few of which have been lost, thickly and uniformly covered 

 with papillae both dorsally and ventrally, those in the neighborhood 

 of the parapodia scarcely longer than the others. All setse are short, 

 only the notopodials of II being noticeably longer than the others. 

 On other segments both notopodial and neuropodial tufts consist of 

 a very few small, slender, tapered, flexible setse composed of numerous 

 joints which are always considerably longer than the diameter of the 

 seta. Neuropodials are no stouter than notopodials. The setse differ 

 from any species of Brada or Trophonia examined by me, but the 

 differences are such as might be expected in juveniles. 



Trophonia papillata Johnson. 



Trophonia papillata Johnson, Proc. Bos. Soc. Nat. Hist., XXIX (1901), 

 p. 416; PI. 12, figs. 122, 123. 



Two specimens dredged at Delmonte wharf, Monterey Bay, July 12, 

 1904. 



The larger one has the head protruded. The mouth is a transverse 

 crescentic slit bounded below by a flat, slightly bilobed lip and above 

 by the slightly arched and thickened prostomium which bears the two 

 thick palps, grooved below, and above them eight tentacles in a trans- 

 verse series; the latter are about one-fourth as thick as the palps 

 and slightly exceed them in length. The small specimen is only 16 

 mm. long with 36 segments, badly abraded and nearly smooth except 

 the anterior four segments which are encased in a coating of agglu- 

 tinated sand grains. This may possibly be a distinct species. 



Trophonia capulata sp. nov. (Plate IX, figs. 60, 61). 



This very distinct species is represented by the type only, which 

 measures, exclusive of the cephalic setse, 108 mm. long, the cephalic 

 setse being 9 mm. and the maximum diameter at the end of the first 

 fourth 5.5 mm. Number of segments 136, the first achsetous. Form 

 elongated clavate, somewhat depressed at anterior end, subterete 

 at middle, becoming gradually subquadrate posteriorly. Anterior 

 half moderately stout, the posterior slender and gently tapered. 

 Ccelom containing many large free eggs. 



Prostomium and peristomium completely retracted within first 

 setigerous somite, leaving a small opening directed somewhat ventrad

and surrounded by prominent papillae, often arranged in groups, 

 and encrusted with fine sand grains, a particularly prominent group 

 of about four forming a small tuft supported on a narrow pedicle in 

 the mid-dorsal line between the first pair of notopodial setae fascicles. 



Anterior end broadly rounded, the first few segments decidedly 

 depressed but increasing in depth rapidly until by about VI they 

 have become terete. These segments are short, crowded and some- 

 what telescoped, so that each one somewhat overlaps the next anterior, 

 especially dorsaUy where this feature is emphasized by the greater 

 prominence of the cutaneous papilla?. Remaining segments very 

 regular, simple and smooth, with clean-cut though shallow furrows 

 and from one-sixth to one-third as long as wide, becoming propor- 

 tionately longer as the diameter decreases posteriorly. Pygidium 

 a simple ring entirely lacking cirri. 



Integument thick and tough and more or less coated with a hard, 

 adhesive layer of fine sand, beyond which the tips of only the larger 

 papilla? project. On the venter and posteriorly the surface is nearly 

 smooth and the incrustation thin, but on the anterior dorsal region it 

 becomes rough and much thicker, forming, with the papillae, projecting 

 anterior margins to the segments and ensheathing even the larger 

 papillae nearly to their ends. The larger cutaneous papilla? are arranged 

 as follows: On the dorsal field is a transverse row of six or eight 

 projecting forward from the cephalic margin of each anterior segment. 

 In the ventral field on each side of the neural line and generally near 

 the middle of the segment is a single clavate papilla, replaced on more 

 anterior segments by a group of two or three; from one to three more 

 occur ventrad of the neuropodium. Surrounding the latter is an 

 irregular ring of papillae composed usually of one or two dorsal and 

 ventral, two to four anterior and usually three posterior, the middle 

 one of the last group being much larger than the others and elevated 

 prominently on a conical base. A similar ring surrounds the noto- 

 podium, the postsetal group here also consisting of one or two of 

 moderate size, and one very large one, often equaling the segment in 

 length anteriorly and elevated on a base which may bear the smaller 

 papillae as well. Passing from before caudad all of these papillae 

 gradually diminish in length, but their arrangement is constant. 



Except on the first two or three segments, on which they are more 

 crowded, the parapodia consist of widely separated notopodial and 

 neuropodial nearly or quite sessile tufts of setae. The former are 

 fan-shaped fascicles of five to eight (the larger numbers on middle 

 segments) flexible capillary setae. Those of the first four (II to V) 




286 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [April, 



are elongated and directed forward, becoming in both respects less 

 so from before backward; on II and III they are remarkably slender 

 and silky and project far in front of the head to a distance of more 

 than twice the diameter of the body; those of V scarcely equal the 

 body diameter. On middle segments the fascicles spread more 

 widely over the dorsum and scarcely exceed the length of their seg- 

 ments. Posteriorly they appear relatively but not actually longer. 

 Neuropodial setse are slightly coarser and fewer than the corresponding 

 notopodials; those of the first three fascicles have filamentous tips 

 and project forward like the notopodials, but are only about half as 

 long; on other segments they curve dorsad up the sides of the body. 



Setse are all pale brown, soft and iridescent. As long as they project 

 forward notopodials and neuropodials are similar, excessively slender, 

 with straight acute tips and numerous cross fractures or nodes, which 

 at the base of fully-grown setae occur five or six in a distance equal to the 

 diameter, becoming gradually fewer until they are six or eight times as 

 far apart. As they lose the filamentous tips the notopodial setse have 

 the region of crowded joints toward the base much restricted (PI. IX, 

 fig. 61). 



Neuropodial seta? in becoming shorter and stouter also acquire fewer 

 and much longer joints, the terminal one becoming especially long 

 and, beginning with V, with a distinctly hooked tip, which a few seg- 

 ments farther back becomes much larger and provided with an acces- 

 sory process (fig. 60), thus having the form of a halter-snap like the 

 setse seen in certain species of Sthenelais. 



Color deep buff -gray and nearly uniform. 



Type locality, San Diego Bay, Cal., between tide limits. 

 Flabelligera commensalis sp. nov. (Plate IX, figs. 62, 63). 



Form moderately slender, thickest in the cephalic fourth, thence 

 tapering to caudal end but usually exhibiting irregular contractions 

 or swellings ; more or less distinctly prismatic and somewhat compressed ; 

 body-walls thin and delicate and more or less ruptured so that the 

 viscera protrude. Type and largest complete specimen 50 mm. long 

 and at the widest part (XX) 2.4 mm. wide and 3.2 mm. deep; this 

 thickness, however, is probably in part due to an abnormal swelling. 

 Number of somites 90; a second complete specimen 48 mm. long has 

 70 segments. 



Prostomium with its appendages capable of complete retraction 

 within the collar and only incompletely exposed in these specimens. 

 So far as observed it consists of a pair of thin membranous dorsal 

 lobes, each bearing a dense tuft of thirty or forty slender tentacular 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 287 



filaments, the ends of which reach in extension scarcely beyond the 

 ends of the collar setae. The palpi, arising immediately beneath the 

 tentacles and above the mouth, are more than twice as long and four 

 or five times as thick as the tentacles, blunt, slightly tapered and finger- 

 like, not at all spatulate or flabelliform, the venter with a deep longi- 

 tudinal groove, the margins of which are merely slightly crenulate 

 and not lobed. Mouth a transverse slit or a more rounded opening 

 with lobed margins normally hidden at the bottom of the collar. 



The collar region, reaching back as far as the first ordinary somite, 

 probably represents the peristomium alone or perhaps both I and II. 

 It consists of a short achaetous posterior ring and a cylindrical or 

 funnelform, thin membranous collar with small dorso-median, ventro- 

 median and lateral incisions in its border, the whole being about as 

 long as the three somites next following. It bears the broad fan- 

 shaped conjoined fascicles of notopodial and neuropodial seta? form- 

 ing a close continuous series, which, like a palisade of stakes, build 

 up the collar to double its own height. When the cephalic appendages 

 are extended they are embraced by the peristomial collar and setae 

 cage and when retracted are concealed within them, the setse of the 

 two sides drawing toward the middle line. The collar, which clearly 

 represents a pair of parapodia, is thickly studded with cutaneous 

 papillae, those at the base of the setae being very numerous, much 

 elongated and slender, with filamentous stalks bearing terminal knobs 

 and often reaching the tips of the setae. 



Succeeding segments are much shorter, their length never exceeding 

 one-third the width, and quite simple, with the intersegmental papillae 

 quite high between the parapodia but elsewhere very slightly developed. 

 Anteriorly for a short distance the body is subterete or subquadrate, 

 but for most of its length, owing to the position of the parapodia, is 

 subtriangular in section, the somewhat truncated apex being ventral, 

 the nearly flat base dorsal and the usually somewhat convex sides 

 lateral. In places where the body is much distended this convexity 

 or bulging may be sufficient to give to it a cross-section approaching 

 the circular. As noted above the body-wall is thin, easily ruptured, 

 and semi-translucent. Most of the surface is smooth and bears few and 

 small papillae, but on the dorsum and about the parapodia they 

 become larger and more numerous, those on and near the notopodia 

 being largest of all and, like the collar papillae, bearing very large 

 terminal knobs, and when extended reaching to the tips of the setae 

 and giving to the notopodia the aspect of erect tufts or tassels. The 

 neuropodial papillae on the other hand are much shorter and, like 

 those scattered over the dorsum, bear small terminal knobs. 




288 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



Parapodia are remarkable chiefly for the position of the neuropodia. 

 The rami are rather large, widely separated and rather conspicuous 

 papilla?. Notopodia situated at the extreme dorsal and widest part 

 of their segments, except on the first few at the basal angles of the 

 triangle. Owing to the slender papillae which they bear they have 

 the form of graceful plumes or tassels bearing a few small capillary 

 setae. Neuropodia are rather larger, stouter and shorter subcorneal 

 tubercles, resembling the false feet of certain caterpillars, and bearing 

 much smaller and less conspicuous papillae and a single stout hooked 

 seta. Except on the first eight or ten segments which are more or less 

 subterete and where they are widely separated, the bases of the two 

 neuropodia are nearly in contact at the neural apex of the compressed 

 triangular body. 



Notopodial and collar setae (PI. IX, fig. 62) are all of the capillary, 

 soft, flexible, cross-fractured type, the former differing only in their 

 much greater length. In addition to a few, scarcely apparent, rudi- 

 mentary setae of the same type each neuropodium bears one (or rarely 

 two) large and stout hook (fig. 63), deep brown and opaque at the end, 

 but becoming paler toward the base and having an imperfect joint 

 below the hooked end. These hooks are directed toward the middle 

 line and are operated in pairs by powerful muscles, forming most 

 effective organs of adhesion. 



Dorsal surface and notopodia more or less deep (sometimes purplish) 

 brown, which color usually completely covers the collar and may extend 

 somewhat down the sides of the body which, like the venter and 

 neuropodia, is pale yellow, usually sharply contrasted with the brown 

 of the dorsum which appears to be due to the sensory papillae. 



The alimentary canal exhibits the gizzard-like stomach and looped 

 intestine characteristic of annelids of this family. Unlike most species 

 of the genus there is no mucous investment, at least on these specimens. 



The four known specimens were taken at Picnic Tables, near Monterey, 

 Cal., on August 14, 1904, from among the spines of Strongylocentrotus 

 purpuratus. The latter is undoubtedly a normal habitat, for which 

 the structure of the worm admirably adapts it. The color, lateral 

 compression of the body, position of the neuropodia and the stout 

 neuropodial hooks would be especially useful in this situation.

These specimens appear to belong to the above-named species, 

 although Miss Bush's species of Sabella are not clearly differentiated 

 in the brief descriptions. The spots on the branchiae are usually five, 

 fairly regular in arrangement, but varying much in intensity and the 

 degree to which they extend on to the gill filaments. The number 

 of rachises varies from IS to 22 on each side. The segments of one 

 counted number 70, 8 of which are setigerous thoracic. 



Distylia rugosa Moore.

 PI. XXXVIII, figs. 3S-41. 



Besides the type and cotype from which this species was originally 

 described several additional specimens, all taken between tides at 

 San Diego, occur in the collection. 



The specimens are of various sizes, the largest measuring in its 

 contracted state 105 mm. long, of which the gills are 30 mm., and 

 11 mm. wide. In the different specimens the branchial rachises vary 

 in number from 24 in one 40 mm. long to 68 on each side of the large 

 specimen. In no case are any of the rachises forked. The branchial 

 bases make about 1% turns. The eyes referred to in the original 

 description are mere specks and dashes of pigment arranged in two 

 series which may coalesce into more or less broken lines or be totally 

 absent. 



Sometimes the branchiae are of a nearly uniform wine brown with 

 regular but obscure transverse pale bands ; in other cases they may be 

 light or dark brown, irregularly mottled with pale. The gill bases are 

 uniform deep brown. At the dorsal end of each abdominal torus is a 

 very deep and conspicuous brown spot, from which a narrow brown 

 line runs along the torus for its entire length, ending in a small spot 

 at the ventral end. The ventral plates are very deep purplish brown, 

 the body elsewhere pale brown. 



The largest specimen has the collar region so relaxed that the r mouth 

 parts are well displayed. The tentacles are narrowly lanceolate with 

 a small divergent basal lobe and reach barely to the distal border of 

 the branchial base.

The branchial barbs are somewhat longer — four or five times the 

 diameter of the rachises and diminished but slightly toward the distal 

 end — and the dorsal branchial lappet is very prominent. Both speci- 

 mens are filled with nearly mature eggs. One has nine setigerous 

 segments, the other only six and the thorax shorter than the gills. 

 The first has the eye-spots scattered through a wide zone and occa- 

 sionally more than one on a rachis ; the other has a single nearly black 

 eye-spot proximad of the middle on most of the middle rachises. 

 Both have the gills otherwise colorless. 



The tubes form a cluster of three and are nearly colorless, stiff and 

 hard and covered with an incrustation of fine sand. Two other empty 

 tubes dredged near the same locality probably also belong to this 

 species. 



SERPULID^E. 

 Protula superba sp. nov. (Plate IX, figs. 64, 65). 



The least contracted specimen of this magnificent serpulid has the 

 body 88 mm. long and the contracted gill-crowns 37 mm. long; length 

 of thorax measured along venter of mantle 37 mm. ; width of thorax 

 at anterior end 16 mm., at posterior end 12 mm. ; depth at latter point 

 7 mm. ; width of abdomen at middle 10 mm. ; depth at same point 9 

 mm.; length of branchial base 9 mm.; length of one of the longest 

 rachises 23 mm. Number of thoracic segments 8 (7 setigerous), of 

 abdominal segments 115-120. Another specimen is even larger but 

 more contracted. 



The contracted branchial crowns form a pair of great compact 

 brushes or plumes, the base and axis of which is a high spiral perma- 

 nently wound into seven or eight close turns, stout and of firm texture 

 throughout and triangular in section. They are readily detached, 

 leaving a triangular scar on each side of the mouth. Leaving a short 

 pedicel of attachment the branchiferous spiral begins on the dorsal 

 side and bears in the one cotype on which they were counted no less 

 than 320 radioles in a closely crowded series on each side. The basal 

 ones are the longest and they diminish in length regularly to the apex 

 at a rate that indicates that their tips reach a uniform level in full 

 extension. A rather thick interbranchial membrane is connected 

 with the outer faces of the basal ends of the rachises and unites them 

 for about one-fifth of their length. The rachises are compressed 

 triangular with the base directed outward and the apex toward the 

 center; narrow membranous borders are appended to the basal 

 angles and reach from the interbranchial membrane nearly to their 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 291 



tips. A double rank of numerous pinnae or filaments arises along the 

 inner or apical face of the rachises and continues nearly to their tips ; 

 the longest of these scarcely exceed the greater diameter of the rachises 

 and they diminish in length distally. 



Tentacles lanceolate, foliaceous, about as long as the diameter of 

 the branchial bases, to the ventral side of which they are attached. 

 Just within them, enclosing the mouth and about one-third as high 

 as the inter branchial membrane, are the oral membranes, which like 

 the tentacles are detached with the branchial crowns. Mouth trans- 

 verse, its corners bounded above by a low rounded elevation, from 

 between which a tongue-shaped process projects over the mouth. 

 Ventral to it is a soft irregular lip, and below this again a much larger 

 firm triangular lip. 



Thorax depressed, broader anteriorly than posteriorly and regularly 

 tapered caudally. Segments eight, all but the peristomium setigerous ; 

 intersegmental furrows obsolete. Thoracic mantle thin and greatly 

 developed, embracing all of the setae tufts and extending beyond them 

 to a width fully equal to that of the thorax. Though folded and 

 somewhat tufted between the fascicles of setae the margin of the mem- 

 brane appears to be entire and not scalloped. Its cephalic border is 

 divided into a pair of dorsal setal lobes, enclosing the collar seta tufts, 

 and a ventral pair of branchial lobes. The median notch separating the 

 latter is wide and shallow, the lateral notches, on the contrary, being 

 deep and narrow. The posterior fold or apron is thicker, has an 

 extensive glandular area and projects only slightly as a broad median 

 ventral lobe. There is a broad but shallow and rather ill-defined 

 dorsal thoracic groove and an annular groove, somewhat distinct on 

 the dorsum, separating the thorax and abdomen. 



Abdomen rather soft, broadly rounded laterally, slightly depressed, 

 tapered gently to the pygidium and divided into dorsal, lateral or 

 parapodial, and ventral or neural fields, the latter being marked by a 

 broad, open fecal groove. Abdominal segments numerous, very 

 short, much crowded, and distinctly indicated by the extensive tori 

 only. Integument of dorsal and ventral surfaces more or less swollen 

 and wrinkled, probably in part due to the preserving fluid. A cal- 

 careous incrustation occupies a nearly circular area on the dorsum 

 of the caudal end, which is bluntly rounded and terminated by a very 

 short pygidium containing a large, vertical, slit-like anus guarded 

 by somewhat tumid lips. 



Thoracic setae form seven compact flattened tufts, somewhat spread- 

 ing distally, of very numerous setae; they project obliquely dorsad 




292 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



and the collar tuft somewhat cephalad, the others caudad. The 

 collar fascicle is subdivided into two, the others into three ranks 

 closely united above but separating somewhat ventrally, the anterior 

 rank being composed of smaller seta? and separated from the others 

 by a small membranous fold. All thoracic setae (PI. IX, fig. 65) 

 are similar, pale yellow, narrowly bilimbate, the more dorsal ones 

 somewhat longer and those of the posterior rank slightly curved. 

 Abdominal fascicles are much smaller, with seldom more than twelve 

 shorter but otherwise similar setse. At the caudal end a certain 

 number of segments bear much longer, very slender capillary setse 

 without limbse. 



Thoracic tori are very difficult to discern, the long, somewhat irregu- 

 lar series of very numerous uncini being nearly embedded in thick 

 glandular areas below the setse tufts. The narrow, vertical abdominal 

 tori occupy the sides of the segments rather toward the venter. They 

 are crowded fleshy folds slightly free and projecting at both ends, 

 longer in the middle of the abdomen, becoming shorter toward both 

 ends, and finally obsolete caudally. Uncini (PI. IX, fig. 65) ver3 r 

 numerous, not less than 350 on VIII, small, with the toothed margin 

 very long, conspicuously elevated above and prolonged into a slender, 

 blunt and slightly bifid or notched process below and bearing twenty 

 to twenty-five long, slender, acute teeth, of which four or five smaller 

 ones are on the inferior prolongation. No difference between thoracic 

 and abdominal tori was perceived. At the ventral end of each abdomi- 

 nal torus is a small group of simple spines which persist through the 

 caudal region after the uncini have ceased. 



All of the four specimens examined are quite colorless and totally 

 ack pigment. The preserved worms bear a striking resemblance in 

 form to the conventionalized classic torch with the vigorous and some- 

 what divided flame represented by the gill plumes, which when living 

 and extended must form a magnificent crown. 



Tube white, thick, massive, the walls often 5-6 mm. thick and the 

 outer diameter up to 19 mm. The inner layers are hard and stony, 

 the lining somewhat polished, the outer layers becoming chalky and 

 the outer surface roughened by numerous growth lines. The older 

 parts make several irregular open coils beneath and around stones, 

 the newer portions extending freely horizontally into the water, in 

 one case to a distance of 145 mm. Orifice perfectly terete, smooth, 

 polished and thin. 



The type (No. 79, Coll. Acad. Nat. Sci.), together with the tube 

 and two other worms, were collected for the Academy at Pacific Grove,

near Monterey Bay, at a depth of 40 fathoms, by Prof. Harold Heath. 

 A single example appears in the Stanford University collection, and 

 was taken by a Chinese fisherman on a red-cod line in the vicinity 

 of Monterey Bay on February 20, 1902. 



Several species of Protula have been described from the Pacific, and 

 it is possible that P. atypha Bush or some of the other smaller species 

 may be the young of this, but they have far fewer branchial rachises. 

 Indeed this species departs from typical members of the genus in the 

 large number of rachises and complexity of the gill-bearers or bases.

 June 28, 1904. Three medium-sized specimens with portions of tubes. 



The operculum is more slender and has a more finely serrated margin 

 than the one figured by Johnson. One counted had 140 serrations 

 and ribs and 38 pairs of branchial rachises.

Sabellaria Californica Fewkes, Bull. Essex Inst., XX (1S89), pp. 130-132; 

 PI. VII, figs. 3 and 4. 



Only two specimens from San Diego are contained in the collection. 

 In the vicinity of Monterey Bay the species appears to be more abun- 

 dant, specimens being present from "Lighthouse Point," June 28, 1904; 

 "big tide pool," June 20, 1905, and Delmonte wharf, dredged July 12, 

 1904. 



The degree of pigmentation differs greatly, some being pale, others 

 deep brown, the latter type strongly prevailing. 



This species is readily distinguished from the next by the character 

 of the opercular spines, which, with the exception of those of the con- 

 cealed inner series, are opaque, dark brown or black. The exposed 

 parts of the outer series are erect, of the inner and middle series 

 recumbent, whereas in S. cementarium the yellow spines of all three 

 series are more or less erect, those of the middle series being very 

 prominently so. The exposed parts of both the inner and middle 

 series of this species are placed at right angles to the slender stem or 

 tendon. The long, pick-like spines of the middle series (fig. 66a) are 

 very hard and the pointed, slightly hooked tips frequently interdigi- 

 tate and cross in the middle, completely concealing the inner whorl. 

 The latter (fig. 66o) are much more delicate, flattened, yellow, some- 




294 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



what chaff-like structures, the divided and densely fringed tips of 

 which often embrace the ends of the middle series of spines. 



The tubes of this species Fewkes describes as forming great masses 

 of agglutinated sand grains and shell fragments in the caverns of 

 wave-worn cliffs. Those of S. cementarium, so far as known, occur 

 singly or in small groups attached to shells and stones. Which one 

 of these species, if either, was described by Baird under the name of 

 S. saxicava it is impossible to determine from the brief description. 

 So far as it goes the description fails to fit either, and it seems probable 

 that a third species is represented on this coast.

Scolithus linearis Burrows with Orifice Complete. — Mr. Benjamin 

 Smith Lyman remarked that Scolithus linearis, so abundant at many 

 places in the Pennsylvania Cambrian quartzite, was long supposed to 

 be a fucoid plant; and even so late as thirty years ago was in a well- 

 known valuable text-book called a plant, though at least fifteen years 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 297 



earlier it had been correctly given as a worm-burrow in Dana's Manual, 

 where it was said to be common in the Potsdam sandstone. Walcott 

 later found it to be Cambrian; and said, in 1890, he had never seen it 

 in the classical Potsdam. 



Specimens were met with during a field excursion of the Minera- 

 logical and Geological Section on October 17, 1908, which fully 

 demonstrated with remarkable clearness that the Scolithus linearis is a 

 worm-burrow in the sand of a sea-beach. In one of Mr. Bean's Cam- 

 brian quartzite quarries, called by him the Davis quarry, at the eastern 

 end of the North Valley Hill and at three-quarters of a mile southwest 

 of Valley Forge, many burrows of Scolithus linearis were found ; 

 and on one small slab, with burrows, numerous little circular ridges were 

 instantly recognized by Mr. F. J. Keeley as the crater-shaped orifices of 

 Scolithus holes precisely like those of sand-burrowing worms to be seen 

 on our present sea-beaches at Atlantic City and elsewhere (Plate X). 



The highly interesting and useful, perhaps hitherto unique slab, 

 5J X 6J inches, was presented to the Academy by the finder, Mr. 

 Alan G. Smith. It is well, however, to bear in mind, that further 

 quarrying may, of course, disclose other equally perfect specimens 

 that originated on the same ancient sea-beach. 



A somewhat similar burrow with a rather complete orifice was found 

 by the late Ellis Clark "in the Siluro-Cambrian limestone of Lehigh 

 County, about a quarter of a mile north of Helf rich's Spring:" and is 

 described by Prof. Frederick Prime in Report D2, p. 79, of the State 

 Geological Survey, 1878. The fossil was submitted to Dr. Otto 

 Torell, Director of the Geological Survey of Sweden, and at once 

 recognized by him as belonging to his genus Monocraterion, and given 

 the specific name of lesleyi. The genus is closely allied to Scolithus, 

 but the straight tube "gradually expands at the top into a funnel- 

 shaped cavity, corresponding to a like protuberance in the animal." 

 The smaller part of the tube is larger than our Scolithus; and in one 

 specimen is three-eighths of an inch in diameter, with the funnel ex- 

 panding, within a length of half an inch, to an inch or more in diameter. 



The following were ordered to be published :

THE OCCURRENCE OF BUFO COLUMBIENSIS EAST OF THE ROCKY 



MOUNTAINS. 



BY ROBERT T. YOUNG. 



High mountain chains, especially those whose crests extend above 

 timber line, are more or less efficient barriers to the spread of animals. 

 This is more particularly so in the case of species which do not migrate 

 easily from place to place. 



The capture of Bufo columbiensis on the eastern slope of the Conti- 

 nental Divide in Colorado is, therefore, of some interest. 



In August, 1902, I obtained a specimen of this toad on the eastern 

 slopes of the Arapahoe Peaks, about 28 km. west of Boulder, Colo., at 

 an altitude of about 3,100 m., and it has since been reported to me by 

 Prof. Beardsley, of the Colorado State Normal School, from the eastern 

 slope of the mountains west of Greeley. 



Cope 1 gives this species as a characteristic of the Pacific district of 

 the Western sub-region of the Medicolumbian region, included in the 

 Transition of Merriam. 2 My records, however, show it to occur in the 

 Hudsonian zone, far above the upper limit of the Transition, where it 

 has doubtless migrated from its original habitat. 



There are several passes in northern Colorado over the Continental 

 Divide which cross the mountains below timber line, affording possible 

 paths of migration for toads from the western to the eastern slope. 



Further observations on the distribution of this species on both 

 slopes of the mountains, taken from year to year, would doubtless be 

 of interest as affording some data for a determination of the conditions 

 and rate of migration of toads.

ON THE SPINNERETS, CRIBELLUM, COLULUS, TRACHEJE AND LUNG BOOKS 



OF ARANEADS. 



BY THOMAS H. MONTGOMERY, JR. 



This paper presents observations on the ontogeny of the organs men- 

 tioned in the title, together with notes on the anatomy of the cribellum 

 and colulus and with certain considerations on the broader mor- 

 phological relations of these various organs. 



The embryos of the spiders examined were killed in Carnoy's fluid 

 (absolute alcohol, chloroform and glacial acetic acid in equal parts, 

 with corrosive sublimate to saturation), an excellent fixative that 

 makes it possible to cut with ease good series of paraffine sections; 

 it has the disadvantage of frequently producing an extra ovat of yolk 

 in the earlier stages. After fixation and hardening the egg membranes 

 are readily removed with needles. In order to secure good surface 

 views of the abdomen after the stage of reversion it is best to cut off 

 the cephalothorax, and with a knife to remove a considerable portion 

 of the abdomen itself so as to allow the stain (preferably Delafield's 

 hsematoxyline) to penetrate evenly. The adult spinning organs 

 with the cribellum or colulus are best examined in balsam after 

 dehydration and clearing, and after the dorsal half of the abdomen 

 has been cut away. Of Theridium tepidariorum and Loxosceles 

 rufescens I secured accurately timed stages by breeding females in 

 captivity. The material of Theridium was collected by me at Woods 

 Hole, Massachusetts, and thai of Loxosceles, Evagrus and Filistata 

 hiberncdis at Austin, Texas. I am obliged to Mr. Nathan Banks for the 

 determination of these species. 



1. Colulus, Cribellum and Spinnerets. 



The first question to be taken up is the matter of the morphological 

 relations of the colulus and cribellum to the spinnerets. 



According to the classification of Simon (1892) two main groups of 

 the Aranese are distinguished: the Aranese theraphosse and the Ara- 

 nese verse. The former include the families Liphistiidae, Aviculariidse 

 and Atypiclse; of these the first are unique among all spiders in the 

 possession of four pairs of true spinnerets (mammillse), while most 




300 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



Aviculariidse possess only two pairs/ and the Atypidse (the genus 

 Brachybothrium excepted) possess three pairs. Almost all the Aranese 

 verse have three pairs of spinnerets. 2 These discrepancies in number 

 make it somewhat difficult to homologize the pairs of different groups, 

 a difficulty briefly mentioned by Stevenson (1908). 



The three pairs of spinnerets found in most of the Aranea? verse 

 are named in antero-posterior order: the anterior (inferior), the 

 median, and the posterior (superior). Between the spinnerets of the 

 anterior pair may be placed either a cribellum or a colulus, both of 

 which are absent in the Theraphosse. The cribellum was discovered 

 by Blackwall (1839), and has been most thoroughly described by 

 Bertkau (1882) as a small transverse plate, sometimes halved by a 

 median carina, this plate provided with the very numerous minute 

 pores which are the openings of multicellular spinning glands, and the 

 spinning plate enclosed in a chitinous frame. In species possessing 

 it the fourth pair of metatarsi are each provided with a row of recurved 

 hairs, called the calamistrum and also dicovered by Blackwall; the 

 latter is used as a comb to draw out the silk issuing from the cribellum — 

 an operation that can be clearly seen in the larger species of Filistata, 

 though it is performed with great rapidity. In mature males the 

 cribellum is more or less rudimentary, for which Bertkau offers the 

 valid explanation that adult males do not spin snares. Blackwall 

 and Bertkau correctly interpreted the cribellum as a modified and 

 fused pair of spinnerets, while Thorell (1870), who called it the "infra- 

 mamillary organ," argued against such a comparison, though without 

 cogent reasons. 



The colulus or hypopygium (Menge, 1843) is a conical projection or 

 small tubercle occupying approximately the place of the cribellum 

 in some of the families of the Aranese verse which do not possess the 

 cribellum. It has no spinning glands and there is no calamistrum 

 associated with it. Menge compared it with a rudimentary cribellum, 

 but Bertkau argued that the colulus is a simple integumentary fold 

 representing the region between tracheal stigma and cribellum. 



To decide with which of the three pairs of spinnerets of most Aranese 

 the two pairs of most Aviculariidse correspond, I have examined some 



1 The exceptions are the genera Hexathele and Scotinctcus with a third (most 

 anterior) pair of very small spinnerets; and Anisa pis and Diplothele with only 

 one pair. 



2 According to Simon, I.e., less than three pairs are exhibited by the following: 

 the Hadrotarsidae, Palpimanidse (except Huttonia) , the Zodariid genera Lutica, 

 Hermipus, Mediums, and the Archseid Mecysmauchenius — these named genera 

 having only one pair.

early stages of the Aviculariid Evagrus — this being to my knowledge 

 the first account of the embryology of any Theraphosid. The earliest 

 stage possessing extremities found is shown in fig. 28, Plate XIV, a 

 lateral view. Next to the head lobe is found the cheliceron (Chel.), 

 then the pedipalp (Pcd.), then the four pairs of thoracal legs (L. 1- 

 L. 4). The abdomen is remarkable in possessing only two segments 

 (1, 2), whereas in other spiders at a corresponding stage the abdomen 

 would be richly segmented, and in having a huge caudal lobe (C. L.) 

 projecting forward. The next stage available is that of fig. 29, a 

 ventral view of the abdomen: the two pairs of lung books (Pul.) have 

 formed, the nerve ganglia (N. C.) are clearly marked, and there are 

 indications of three pairs of spinnerets. Of the latter the anterior 

 (A. Sp.) are only faintly marked thickenings, and evidently belong 

 to the fourth abdominal segment; the median spinnerets (ill. Sp.) 

 are rounded projections just median to and in the same plane with 

 the largest posterior spinnerets (P. Sp.), therefore outgrowths of the 

 fifth segment. Three successive later stages, shown in figs. 30-32 

 respectively, show that the anterior spinnerets have disappeared and 

 that it is those of the fifth segment, the median and the posterior, 

 that persist into the adult. Thus the fourth segment, as shown clearly 

 in figs. 30 and 31, produces no respiratory organs, but originates a 

 pair of rudimentary spinnerets that subsequently disappear. 



The two pairs of spinnerets of Evagrus, and of probably also other 

 Aviculariids with that number, correspond to the median and posterior 

 spinnerets of those araneads with three pairs; but the development 

 shows that Evagrus retains in the embryo a slight trace of the anterior 

 pair. This homology has been already suggested by Simon, on the 

 basis of the relative position of the parts in the adult. 



In the next place we may consider the colulus, an organ that has 

 received only the scantiest attention. It may be best studied in 

 Sicariids where it attains its greatest size, and the following account 

 applies to the genus Loxosceles. 



In an adult individual the form and position of the colulus is shown 

 on ventral view in fig. 26, PI. XIII. It is an unpaired conical projec- 

 tion (Col.) between the anterior spinnerets (A. Sp.), its base conflu- 

 ent with their bases and at some distance behind the tracheal stigma 

 (T. St.). The transverse line in the figure which crosses it from left 

 to right represents the border of a skin-fold just dorsal to it and to the 

 spinnerets, and this fold is deeply indented in the median line. Its 

 free apex is directed ventro-caudad; its surface bears simple hairs 

 like those on the ventral surface of the abdomen, and the small circles 




302 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



indicate the insertion points of these hairs. A median section of it is 

 represented in fig. 25, where the apex is at the left and the dorsal 

 border uppermost. It is covered by a cuticula (Cut.), which is less 

 thick than that of the adjacent body surface, beneath which is a 

 hypodermis (Hyp.) considerably thicker than that of the rest of the 

 abdomen. The interior of the organ is a blood-space (Bl. Cav.), 

 shown by stippling, containing neither glands nor muscles, though 

 muscles insert near its base. The colulus is equally developed in both 

 sexes. Thus it is a simple integumentary extension with a large 

 axial blood cavity. An organ of its volume must surely fulfill some 

 important function. Its thickened hypodermis might suggest sensory 

 nature. But I think it may be more likely a supplementary respira- 

 tory organ, for which the combination of relatively thin cuticula and 

 vascular space would speak, and furthermore the trachese are relatively 

 poorly developed in this species. 



In Peucetia (Oxyopid) and Lathrodectus (Theridiid) it is about twice 

 as long as broad, shorter and relatively broader in Dysderids and 

 Argiopicls. But in the Agalenids I have found the most interesting 

 relations : in Tegenaria derhamii it is a plate about twice as broad as 

 long, in Hahnia bimaculata a transverse plate eight times as broad as 

 its antero-posterior length, while in Agelena ncevia there are a pair of 

 small plates completely separated in the mid-line by a little more than 

 their diameter and inserted well anterior to the roots of the anterior 

 spinnerets. The last case is interesting, for it exhibits the colulus in 

 a distinctly paired condition, the first case of such a relation yet known. 

 We have next to consider the ontogeny of colulus and spinnerets. 

 Salensky (1871) first proved that the appendages of the fourth and 

 fifth abdominal appendages become the spinnerets. He found the 

 fourth appendages originate the anterior spinnerets, the fifth the 

 posterior, and that the median spinnerets "do not develop from 

 the abdominal feet, but appear between them" (I cite from Jaworow- 

 ski, for I cannot read the original Russian). This origin of the anterior 

 and posterior spinnerets has been confirmed by Locy (1886), Morin 

 (1887), Kishinouye (1890) and Korschelt (1892), while Barrois (1878), 

 Balfour (1880) and Schimkewitsch (1887) erroneously held that the 

 embryonic appendages disappear and that spinnerets are new for- 

 mations. The most detailed and satisfactory account is that of 

 Jaworowski (1895) of Trochosa. He found that after reversion each 

 appendage of the fourth and fifth abdominal segments is bilobed, 

 consisting of an outer sacculus (exopodite) and inner sacculus (end- 

 opodite) ; on the fourth segment the exopodites become the anterior 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 303 



spinnerets and the endopodites form a "rudimentary cribellum" 

 (more strictly, colulus) that later disappears; on the fifth segment 

 the exopodites become the posterior spinnerets, and the endopodites 

 the median spinnerets. Wallstabe (1908) also found, in Agelena, that 

 the median spinnerets arise by splitting off from the posterior pair. 



I am able on embryos of Loxosceles to essentially confirm the account 

 of Jaworowski and to trace the colulus to its adult condition. Fig. 17, 

 PL XIII, represents that stage before reversion, when the maximum 

 number of abdominal appendages is present, and there are seen to be 

 six pairs of them, on segments 2 to 7 inclusive. The two most posterior 

 pairs are the smallest and are temporary, for in the next stage, figs. 

 18, 19, of the beginning reversion they have disappeared and only the 

 four anterior pairs persist. 3 Later, fig. 20, the third and fourth pairs 

 of these appendages become the largest. The process of reversion 

 brings them close together in the mid-line, and an interesting and 

 decisive condition is exhibited in the stage of fig. 21. The fourth pair 

 of appendages (P. Sp.) are approximated, and on the median side of 

 each is an elongated thickening of the hypodermis, the first indication 

 of the median spinnerets (M. Sp.). Between the third pair of append- 

 ages (A. Sp.) there is an undivided, so unpaired, thickening, the pri- 

 mordium of the colulus (Col.). My observations differ mainly from 

 those of Jaworowski in finding the colulus to be unpaired at the start, 

 and in finding that the colulus and the median spinnerets behind it 

 do not arise as saccular endopodites of the embryonic appendages, 

 but as thickenings immediately mesial to the appendages. This is 

 a rather important difference, for Jaworowski's description would 

 indicate a cleft condition of these appendages, such as is found in 

 Crustacea, while I do not find such a condition. In Loxosceles the 

 colulus and the median spinnerets would seem not to be parts of the 

 appendages, but immediately contiguous to them. Figs. 22-24 show 

 successive later stages, with lengthening of the three pairs of spin- 

 nerets and of the unpaired colulus, as well as the gradual extension 

 forward of the largest pair of spinning glands. 



The colulus, accordingly, arises as a hypodermal thickening between 

 the anterior spinnerets, and the median spinnerets from a pair of thick- 



3 In the stage of figs. 18 and 19 there are eleven well-marked abdominal seg- 

 ments exclusive of the caudal lobe. The largest number yet described for 

 araneads is twelve, which with the seven of the cephalothorax makes a total 

 of nineteen. The three most posterior of them together with the caudal lobe 

 constitute a projecting postabdomen, such as has been described for Pholcus 

 bv Claparede (1862) and Schimkewitsch (1887); this may be compared with 

 that of Evagrus, fig. 28, PI. IV. 




304 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



enings between the posterior spinnerets. The only difference in 

 Loxosceles is that the colulus has an unpaired origin; but this differ- 

 ence does not hold in all cases, for in Trochosa ( Jaworowski) the colulus 

 has a paired origin, and we have seen that in Agelena the colulus is a 

 paired structure in the adult. Evidently colulus and median spinnerets 

 are homodynamous. 



I have examined the cribellum in Filistata, Hyptiotes, Uloborus and 

 Dictyna. In the adult female of Filistata there is found a transversely 

 oval plate between the anterior spinnerets and somewhat anterior to 

 them. This plate (fig. 34, Plate XIV) shows a pair of spinning plates 

 (Cr. PL), provided with numerous fine pores, and these spinning plates 

 are set in the much larger chitinous frame ; on the anterior portion of 

 this frame are inserted hairs (their insertion points indicated by the 

 small circles), which hairs are plumose like these of the venter and 

 differ from them only in their much smaller size. These relations are 

 essentially such as Bertkau and others have described. But an im- 

 portant relation seems to have been heretofore entirely overlooked. 

 The paired spinning plates, the cribellum proper, are only the un- 

 covered free surfaces of a pair of appendages, the remaining portion 

 of which is sunk below the chitinous frame. Thus when one examines 

 on a cleared balsam mount the cribellum from the ventral surface, 

 one sees at a higher focus of the microscope only the frame and the 

 spinning plates ; but on deeper focus one finds a column of delicate 

 parallel spinning tubules, too fine to be represented on the scale of 

 our drawing, extending from each spinning plate to the anterior edge 

 of the frame. The lateral boundaries of these columns or append- 

 ages are shown in fig. 34 by the lines extending forward (upward) from 

 the spinning plates (Cr. PL) to the upper border of the frame. 



Further, each spinning plate shows a slight line of division at its 

 middle, from which point of indentation a line extends some distance 

 forward; this subdivision is probably due to the presence of a muscle 

 (as it is certainly in some other species), though I could not clearly 

 recognize a muscle. In other words, the spinning plates are merely 

 the free, uncovered apices of a pair of spinnerets, the greater region of 

 which lie covered by the cuticular frame. Or the relation might be 

 represented in another way: the cribellum of Filistata is a pair of 

 spinnerets mesially approximated, their glands opening distally (on 

 the spinning plates), and across and around these spinnerets has 

 developed a cuticular frame. 



This interesting relation in Filistata is further explained by a study 

 of the embryo shown in fig. 33, PI. XIV; no one has previously de- 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 305 



scribed any developmental stage of the cribellum, for what Jaworowski 

 described as a "rudimentary cribellum" in Trochosa was really a 

 colulus. Fig. 33 represents a ventral view of the abdomen shortly 

 after reversion, and the abdominal segments are well pronounced. 

 The tracheal stigma (T. St.) is at the boundary of the third and fourth 

 segments. On the fourth segment are found the anterior spinnerets 

 (A. Sp.), and between them a pair of large thickenings (Or.), the paired 

 primordium of the cribellum. On the fifth segment are seen the 

 posterior spinnerets (P. Sp.), and between them the median spinnerets 

 as a pair of thickenings (M. Sp.). The resemblance of the cribellum 

 to the median spinnerets at this stage is very close, each consisting of 

 a pair of elongate ectoblastic thickenings near the mid-line; and the 

 cribellum is even larger than the median spinnerets. There can be 

 no doubt in this case of the homodynamy of cribellum and median 

 spinnerets. 



Fig. 36 shows a ventral view of the cribellum of a mature female of 

 Hyptiotes cavatus, and fig. 35 a similar view of that of Dietyna vohipis. 

 In both of these there is a distinct pair of muscles (M.) passing from 

 the spinning plate (Cr. PI.) to the anterior edge of the cuticular frame. 

 In these species the spinning plate is not paired, nor yet is the deeper 

 portion composed of the ductules paired, in which points these species 

 appear much less primitive than Filistata. I find the cribellum of 

 Uloborus plumipes to be very similar to that of Hyptiotes. In Hypti- 

 otes the tracheal stigma (T. St.) is immediately contiguous to the frame 

 of the cribellum, while in Dietyna (fig. 35) they are separated. 



Thus we come to the conclusion that the spinnerets, colulus and 

 cribellum all develop from the fourth and fifth abdominal segments; 

 the anterior spinnerets and colulus or cribellum from the fourth, the 

 median and posterior spinnerets from the fifth, as concluded by Jawor- 

 owski. The colulus and cribeilum arise as elongate thickenings mesial 

 from the appendages of these segments, the appendages becoming the 

 anterior and posterior spinnerets. Colulus and cribellum, as we have 

 seen, are in their development homodynamous with the median spin- 

 nerets of the segment behind them. Accordingly, colulus and cribel- 

 lum arising in a similar position in corresponding segments must be 

 considered essentially homologous organs, conformably with the view 

 of Blackwall, whom Dahl (1901, 1904) has followed. The case of 

 Filistata renders it a strong probability that the colulus and cribellum 

 correspond with the antero-median spinnerets of Liphistius. The 

 cribellum is a less degenerate structure than the colulus, because it 

 still possesses spinning glands, is larger, and is more frequently paired.

2. Development of the Trache.e. 



Locy (1886), the first to mention the development of these struc- 

 tures, simply states that "upon the ventral surface appear the infold- 

 ings, from which are formed the tracheae." Schimkewitsch (1887) 

 is mistaken in saying that Balfour (1880) demonstrated the origin of 

 tracheae and lungs, for Balfour did not mention these organs. Schim- 

 kewitsch briefly mentions a stage in Lijcosa before hatching where the 

 tracheae are already branched. Kishinouye (1890) writes: "In the 

 basal part of the second abdominal appendage, on the interior side, 

 another ectodermic invagination is produced. It assumes the shape 

 of a deeply invaginated tube and remains in this condition till after 

 the time of hatching. The appendage itself is not invaginated and 

 becomes from this time gradually shorter." Purcell (1895) states 

 that the " entapophyses connected with the second (tracheal) pair 

 of appendages become each drawn out into a long tube, to or near the 

 blind, inner end of which the middle pair of endosternites is attached 

 in the adult. These long tubes are represented by the two large 

 trunks which form the tracheae in the Attidae, and by the medial pair 

 of the four trunks which compose the tracheae in most other Spiders 

 (Agelenidae, Drassidae, Epeiridae, Lycosidae, etc.)." 4 



The preceding references to the tracheae are all brief and not illus- 

 trated by figures. Simmons (1894) goes into the subject somewhat 

 more fully; he finds the tracheae arising before reversion behind the 

 appendage of the third abdominal segment as a tubular, ectoblastic 

 ingrowth, and the tube so produced to have an irregular folding of its 



4 My friend Dr. Purcell's brief but important preliminary paper deals mostly 

 with the homologies of the tracheae and entopoyhyses, on which subject he has 

 now an extensive paper in press. I have not considered these relations In 

 Loxosceles I find just latero-posterior to each appendage of the four anterior 

 abdominal pairs a thickening which appears darker than the surroundings on 

 stained surface views, these being marked x in figs. 20-24 of PI. XIII. I have 

 not determined whether these are apophyses or simple muscle insertions. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 307 



wall, resembling to some extent the primary folds of the pulmonary 

 invagination. After the stage of reversion he figures it as a simple 

 tube without branching. The most recent paper is that of Janeck 

 (1909); he did not see the earliest stages, but describes and figures a 

 stage shortly after hatching with the beginning of the branching, and 

 an advanced stage after reversion. 



Accordingly, no one has figured the earliest stages of the trachea 3 , 

 and our knowledge of their development is very fragmentary. 



In Loxosceles the conditions are as follows, as observed in surface 

 views only. In the stages of figs. 17-19, Plate XIII, the appendages 

 of the third abdominal segment (3) are simple rounded protuberances 

 like those of the adjacent segments. Later, fig. 20, the appendage of 

 the third segment becomes flatter and less distinct, and its elevated por- 

 tion has taken on somewhat the shape of a quarter moon. At the 

 stage of fig. 21, completed reversion, no elevated appendages are found 

 in that segment, but at its posterior edge a transverse groove circularly 

 enlarged at each lateral corner (T. St.). This condition persists 

 through the stages of figs. 22 and 23, but at that of fig. 24 a pair of 

 lateral tracheal branches, recognizable by being filled with air, and 

 marked Tr., are growing forward from the groove. The transverse 

 groove is evidently the stigma leading into the vestibulum; and this 

 stigma, developing at the posterior edge of the third segment, evi- 

 dently arises behind the appendages of the segment. In the adult 

 a larger median and four pairs of smaller lateral tracheae extend for- 

 ward from the vestibulum (fig. 27). 



A better knowledge can be obtained from the study of sections 

 which I have made of Theridium. At the time of reversion (fig. 16, 

 PL XII) the abdominal appendages show much the same relation as in 

 Loxosceles, though a narrow elevated ectoblastic ridge joins the second 

 and third abdominal appendages (£. Ap., 3. Ap.). Sections of this 

 stage (figs. 1, 2, PL XI) show the still heightened appendage (3. Ap.) 

 of the third segment behind the pulmonary invagination and a distinct 

 coelomic sac (Coel.) appertaining to it. But in subsequent stages 

 (figs. 5, 7, 9) the appendage of the third segment disappears, the 

 whole becoming flush with the remainder of the surface of that seg- 

 ment and without any process of invagination. It is not until after 

 this appendage has disappeared entirely that the tracheal invagination 

 takes place, and evidently as in Loxosceles behind the region where 

 that appendage was. The first appearance of the tracheae is seen in fig. 

 12, PL XII ; the pulmonary stigma (P. St.) is at the posterior edge of the 

 second segment, the tracheal (T. St.) not near this, as was the append- 




308 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



age of its segment, but close to the spinnerets (Sp.) at the posterior 

 edge of the third segment. The stigma (T. St.) is a slight transverse 

 groove, the trachea (TV.) itself is a conical plug of ectoblast cells push- 

 ing into the archiccelic space between hypodermis and mesoblast 

 (Mes.). Successive later stages of the ectoblastic impaired ingrowth 

 (T. St.) are shown in median section in figs. 13-15; in these stages 

 it already shows the division into an outer vestibulum, transversely 

 widened, from the middle of which extends forward a single tracheal 

 trunk, all with a thin chitinous lining. Fig. 15 is the stage of hatching, 

 aged fifteen days, and shows just behind the stigma the still solid 

 primordium of the colulus (Col.). 



Thus the appendages of the third abdominal segment disappear 

 entirely by merging with the circumjacent hypodermis and without 

 forming any invagination. Quite independent of them and at the 

 posterior margin of the third abdominal segment arises subsequently 

 an unpaired ectoblastic inpushing, the vestibulum, from the middle 

 part of which grows forward a little before the time of hatching a single 

 tracheal trunk. I have not found any indications of folding of the 

 tracheal wall like the pulmonary folding, such as Simmons described, 

 and I would judge that the fold supposed by Simmons to be the trachea, 

 represented in his fig. 8, is not a tracheal invagination at all, but merely 

 the space dorso-posterior to the caudal lobe. 



Reference may be made, in passing, to the relative position of the 

 segments in the adult abdomen. The pulmonary stigma marks the 

 posterior border of the second segment, the tracheal stigma (or, in 

 Dipneumonids, that of the second pair of lungs) the posterior border 

 of the third segment, while the anterior and posterior spinnerets mark 

 the posterior regions of the fourth and fifth segments respectively. 

 In Loxosceles the third segment comes to occupy a large portion of the 

 venter, as shown in figs. 22-24, PI. XIII. In Filistata (fig. 33, PI. XIV) 

 and Evagrus (figs. 30-32) the third segment is relatively much smaller 

 After the stage of reversion the first abdominal segment cannot be 

 distinguished externally from the second, and I am inclined to think 

 it enters mostly into the composition of the pedicel. 



3. Development of the Lung-books. 



A considerable amount of work has been done upon the development 

 of these organs since Salensky (1871) showed that they are derived 

 from the appendages of the second abdominal segment. 



Bertkau (1872) found that new lamellae are added during the growth 

 of the spider, each new one as an invagination from the region of the 

 lateral corner of the stigma. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 309 



Locy (1886) figured and described two rather late stages, in the earlier 

 of which "the lungs appear as oblong plates of cells, the large oval 

 nuclei of which are arranged in parallel rows"; ultimately there result 

 bicellular interlamellar pillars. Schimkewitsch (1887) described briefly 

 a single rather late stage before hatching, the single figure of which 

 given by him by no means proves that "the lungs of the embryo of 

 Lycosa saccata consist of true trachea? disposed in bundles." Morin 

 (1887) found the lungs to be formed from thickenings at the bases of the 

 appendages of the second abdominal segment, these thickenings becom- 

 ing the opercula, What Bruce (1887) has described as a pulmonary 

 operculum and lung cavity seems to be nothing more, and Kishinouye 

 has previously made the criticism, judging from his figs. LXXIX and 

 LXXIX, 1 than the caudal lobe at the stage of reversion and the space 

 between it and the body wall; his account has accordingly no value. 

 Kishinouye (1890) found "in the basal part of the first abdominal 

 appendage of each side, there arises an ectodermic invagination whose 

 opening faces away from the median line. ... Of the wall of the 

 invaginated pocket, that which faces the distal end of the appendage 

 is much thicker than the opposite wall, filling the interior of the 

 appendage. The cells composing it become after awhile arranged in 

 parallel rows. Each two of these parallel rows adhering together 

 produce the lamellae of the lung-book. The external epithelium of the 

 appendage which covers these lamellae becomes the operculum of the 

 lung-book after it is depressed in height." Simmons (1894) has given 

 the fullest account up to his time, and the one most fully illustrated by 

 figures. He described fully the method of invagination of the first 

 abdominal appendage, found on its inner (mesial) surface a series of 

 folds during this process of invagination, which folds he believed 

 become the pulmonary lamellae. There is, however, a great hiatus 

 between the stages of his figs. 6 and 7, and the early embryonic folds 

 do not lie in the same position as the adult lamellae. Purcell (1895) 

 found that "the earliest lung-leaves appear on the exposed posterior 

 sides of the appendages before the latter have commenced to sink 

 below the surface into the body, and completely outside of the basal 

 sack," and, like Simmons, he concludes these become the adult lamellae, 

 but without tracing completely their later history. Wallstabe (1908) 

 says he can corroborate Simmon's results, but does not enter into 

 details. 



Jaworowski(1894) presented a full account, well illustrated, but did 

 not describe any stage earlier than one considerably later than reversion. 

 He began with a stage where beneath the first abdominal appendage 




310 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



there is a saccular invagination, from which proceeds dorsally a tube 

 dividing into several branches; "it is, however, clear that the so-called 

 lungs of the spider in the embryonal condition are repeatedly branched 

 trachea?." These tracheal tubes ultimately disappear, and the de- 

 finitive pulmonary lamellae arise from parallel outgrowths of the vesti- 

 bule (Vorraum). 



Finally, the latest memoir, that of Janeck (1909) on Lycosa, is 

 the most extensive, and he had not only an excellent series of stages, 

 but he also made use of wax reconstructions. He describes thoroughly 

 the infolding of the first abdominal appendage, finds that it develops 

 a series of pronounced folds on its inner (mesial) surface, thus far 

 essentially corroborating the observations of Simmons and Purcell, 

 but, contrary to these writers, he finds these embryonic folds disappear. 

 "Especially important is the demonstration that the folds of text 

 figure 16, which many authors refer directly to the lung-leaves, have no 

 relation at all to the lung . . . and the fold formation of these stages 

 show themselves to be not even forerunners of the lung-leaves." The 

 pulmonary lamella? arise as secondary folds from a compact lung mass. 



It will be seen that there are considerable differences of opinion, out 

 of which it is hard to reach the true state of affairs. My observations 

 are in entire disagreement with the conclusions of Schimkewitsch and 

 Jaworowski, that the lungs arise as tubular tracheae, and I believe 

 that Jaworoski misinterpreted embryonic dorso-ventral muscles. 

 Then neither of these authors described the earliest stages. With 

 Purcell, I find folds appearing upon the posterior surface of the pulmo- 

 nary appendages before it invaginates ; but, in opposition to him and 

 Simmons, and in agreement with Janeck, I find these folds are only 

 temporary, and that the definitive lamella? arise from a disassociated 

 solid cell mass. Locy, Morin and Kishinouye were correct, so far as 

 their observations went. 



In Theridium, about the stage of reversion, the pulmonary stigma 

 (P. St., fig. 1, PI. XI) is present as an ectoblastic invagination just behind 

 the appendage of the second abdominal segment, and on the posterior 

 face of this appendage are present three folds (Lam. 1). These embry- 

 onic folds may be called the primary lamella?. In a later stage, shown 

 in fig. 2 (a surface view of this stage is represented in fig. 16, PI. XII), the 

 pulmonary stigma (P. St.) has become deeper, and the primary 

 lamella? (Lam. 1) more pronounced. Later, fig. 3, the pulmonary sac 

 or chamber has become a narrow space by the further insinking of the 

 pulmonary appendage. Two primary lamella? can be still distinguished 

 (Lam. 1) but they have become relatively smaller; fig, 4 is a section 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 311 



of the same appendage but to one side of the stigma, where there is a 

 closed tube beneath the outer ectoblast formed by overgrowth in 

 the manner described by Janeck. Fig. 5 represents a stage still later ; 

 the whole pulmonary appendage has become flattened down to the sur- 

 face of the abdomen, the primary lamella? {Lam. 1) are not more than 

 two in number and only slightly pronounced, while the anterior end 

 of the pulmonary ingrowth is growing larger in the cephalad direction. 

 In fig. 6, cut to one side of the stigma (so comparable with fig. 4 of an 

 earlier stage), the anterior region of the solid ingrowth is divided into 

 two parts, the beginning of the first two true or secondary lamellae 

 {Lam. 2). The slightly later stage of fig. 7 is particularly instructive. 

 The abdomen now makes a short angle with the cephalothorax, so 

 that the layer of ectoblast {Ed.) most to the left in the figure is the 

 lining of the cephalothorax. The pulmonary stigma {P. St.) occupies 

 the same relative position as in fig. 5, but the pulmonary sac or cavity 

 {P. Cav.), which is lined on all sides by ectoblast, has become more 

 voluminous and anterior extensions of it lead into three secondary 

 lamellae {Lam. 2). There is no longer any trace of the primary lamellae. 

 These had become gradually shorter in the successive stages, shown 

 in figs. 2, 3, and 5, being only faintly marked in the last. There 

 is no trace of them in the stage of fig. 7 ; were they present they should 

 show just above the stigma {P. St.) on the mesial (right) side of the 

 ectoblastic operculum. The primary lamellae have not become the 

 secondary lamellae {Lam. 2), for the latter are directed cephalad and 

 arise, as we have seen, from the solid anterior portion of the pulmonary 

 primordium. These results are in essential agreement with those of 

 Janeck, though in the form studied by him, Lycosa, the primary 

 lamellae are larger and more numerous, and by the fusion of their free 

 ends with the mesial wall of the lung cavity give rise to a series of small 

 cavities lined by ectoblast which ultimately close up. The primary 

 lamellae do not become the lamellae of the adult, and, as Janeck has 

 indicated, would seem to have no more morphological importance than 

 the slight integumentary folds found on the mesial side of the proxi- 

 mal portion of the cephalothoracal appendages. 



The history of the secondary or definitive lamellae is as follows. 

 Arising from the solid anterior region of the lung tissue, as shown in 

 figs. 6 and 7, these lamellae become larger and more cylindrical with 

 narrower lamina {Lam. 2, fig. 8). Successive ones are formed from the 

 solid mesial wall of the lung ingrowth, and in their growth they press 

 into an archiccelic cavity (J5/. Cav.) between the ectoblast {Ed.) and 

 mesoblast {Mes.). In fig. 9, PI. XII, three of these secondary lamellae 




312 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



(Lam. 2) are shown; each contains a narrow canal communicating 

 posteriorly with the main pulmonary cavity (P. Cav.) and their wall is 

 lined by a very flattened epithelium; where the nuclei are placed there 

 is a heightening of the cytoplasm around them, and the figure shows 

 clearly the biserial arrangement of the nuclei, at certain intervals 

 bicellular pillars occurring between adjacent lamellse. The archiccelic 

 space around these lamellse has become a vascular cavity (Bl. Cav.), 

 shown by stippling. A cross-section of the lung region of this stage 

 is shown in fig. 10; in the vascular cavity (Bl. Cav.) lie the lamellse 

 (Lam. 2) which are seen to be flattened tubes. The last stage I have 

 been interested to examine is that of fig. 11, one of about nine days 

 (hatching usually takes place in the fifteenth day)- Five lamellse are 

 developed, but owing to obliquity of the section none are seen in their 

 full length. 5 Mesial to them (to the right in the figure) there is an ecto- 

 blastic layer (Ect.), from which further lamellse will be formed. The 

 relation of the bicellular pillars to the lamellse and to the blood cavity 

 (Bl. Cav.) is perfectly clear. 



Thus each lung-book arises in the region of the appendage of the 

 second abdominal segment. Immediately behind this appendage devel- 

 ops an ectoblastic invagination, the stigma and pulmonary chamber, 

 and into this the appendage invaginates. There are temporary lamellse 

 on the posterior surface of this appendage, and these come to lie within 

 the pulmonary chamber, but they disappear entirely and from a 

 thickened cell mass of the anterior region of the invagination the 

 secondary or definitive lamellse develop. The appendage thereby 

 forms both operculum and secondary lamellse. 



4. Genetic Relations of the Tracheae and Lung-books 



of Araneads. 



In the Aranese theraphosse there are two pairs of lung-books and no 

 trachese, and this is also the case in the Hypochilidse among the Ara- 

 nese verse. Nothing is known of the development of these organs 

 in these forms, except my observation that in Evagrus the lung-books 

 are derivations of the second and third abdominal segments. All 

 other Aranese verse with two exceptions have one pair of lung-books 



5 It will be noted that all the drawings on Plate XI are made to the same scale, 

 yet in some cases, as on comparison of fig. 3 with figs. 2 and 5, the parts and nuclei 

 of one embryo may be much smaller than in another embryo of approximately 

 the same age. This is because there are great individual differences in the size 

 of eggs, so of the size of the cells that compose them. The number of cells 

 appears to be constant for a particular stage, but the size of the cells depends 

 upon the size of the embryo.

and an unpaired or paired (Dysderida?) tracheal stigma; the excep- 

 tions are the Caponiida? with four tracheal stigmata, but no lung-books, 

 and the Pholcidae with one pair of lung-books, but with no trachea 1 

 or only very rudimentary ones (Lamy, 1902). 



There has been much discussion as to the genetic relations of these 

 two organs. They have been so fully and ably compared by Lamy 

 that it is not necessary to more than summarize his account. Since 

 the time of Leuckart (1849) all writers on the subject seem to conclude 

 an essential homodynamy of lung-books and tracheae, save Berteaux 

 (1889), who, however, reached quite an erroneous idea of the structure 

 of the pulmonary lamella?. But three different opinions have arisen, 

 namely, whether the lungs are modified trachea?, the tracheae modi- 

 fied lungs, or both derived from a common ancestral organ. That 

 the lungs are modified tracheae is held by Leuckart (1849), Ley- 

 dig (1855), Bertkau (1872). Schimkewitsch (1884, 1887), Croneberg 

 (1888), Schneider (1892), Sinclair (1892), v. Kennel (1892), Jaworow- 

 ski (1894), Lamy (1902), and Janeck (1909). That the tracheae are 

 derived from lung-books is maintained by Lankester (1881), MacLeod 

 (1884), Kingsley (1893), Simmons (1895), Laurie (1894), Wagner (1895) 

 and Kishinouye (1890) — this group of naturalists being mainly influ- 

 enced by the Limulus-ancestry theory. Finally, Weissenborn (1886) 

 and Bernard (1893) hold that lung-books and tracheae are divergent 

 derivatives of a common ancestral organ, in the one case from tracheae 

 of the type of Peripatus, in the other from acicular glands of Annelids. 



In their adult condition lungs and trachea? are both branched cavities 

 lined by cuticulated h}-podermis. In the lung-books the branches 

 are flattened lamellae placed parallel, in the tracheae the branches are 

 usually cylindrical ramifying tubes. But sometimes the main tracheal 

 trunk has no branches, and sometimes the branches are arranged in 

 parallel bundles, all of which details have been described by Lamy; 

 further, I have noticed in Loxosceles that the large median tracheal 

 trunk is excessively compressed, quite as much as a pulmonary lamella. 

 Further, trachea? and lung-books may replace each other in both the 

 second and third abdominal segments. Therefore there are no radical 

 anatomical differences between the two. 



Ontogenetically both arise as ectoblastic invaginations, and there is 

 a vestibulum in each case. But there are four differences in the develop- 

 ment: (1) In the case of the lung-books the abdominal appendage 

 invaginates and the wall of the part so invaginated bounds the main 

 pulmonary chamber, while the external surface of the appendage 

 becomes the operculum. In the case of the trachea the abdominal 




314 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



appendage does not invaginate, but disappears by merging with the 

 surrounding ectoblast, the trachea arises after it has disappeared, 

 the tracheal vestibulum is not formed from this appendage, and there 

 is no operculum. (2) The pulmonary stigma arises immediately 

 behind its appendage, but the tracheal stigma develops more or less 

 behind the original position of the appendage of its segment. (3) 

 The pulmonary lamellse arise from a thickened solid cell mass, which is 

 not the case with the tracheal branches. (4) The tracheae appear 

 somewhat later in the ontogeny. 



Thus while the anatomical differences are not great the ontogenetic 

 are considerable. The most important difference is that the lung- 

 books develop from appendages. On the basis of this particular 

 difference we must conclude that there is no complete homodynamy 

 between the two sets of organs, but an incomplete resemblance. The 

 trachea exhibits a simpler method of formation, but this in itself need 

 speak no more for primitiveness than for degeneracy. The present 

 evidence does not clearly indicate which is the more primitive. 



5. LlMULUS AND THE ARACHNIDS. 



To one question, however, we may take a more decided stand — that, 

 namely, of the reference of aranead lung-books to the branchiae of 

 Limulus. Since Straus-Durckheim (1829) first insisted that Limulus 

 is much more closely related to Arachnids than to Crustaceans, this 

 view has grown steadily in support, especially in the hands of E. Van 

 Beneden (1871), A. Milne-Edwards (1873), Barrois (1878), Lankester 

 (1881), Patten (1890) and Kingsley (1893). And there can be little 

 question that Limulus and the Arachnids are related, from the corre- 

 spondence in segmentation, arrangement and number of appendages, 

 endosternal and entapophysial structures, central nervous and vascular 

 systems and other organs, all of which have been carefully compared 

 by Lankester and Kingsley. The principal difference between the 

 two has been considered the respiratory organs, and Lankester sought 

 to obviate this by reasoning that the lung-books of Arachnids arose by 

 the invagination of lamelligerous branchial appendages, and that the 

 tracheae are in their turn modifications of lung-books. This view 

 seemed to be confirmed by the accounts of the development of arach- 

 nidan lung-books as given for spiders by Kishinouye, Purcell and Sim- 

 mons, and for the scorpion by Brauer (1895). 6 



6 Brauer's study did not determine the first origin of the pulmonary lamellse , 

 tor there is a gap between the stages shown in his text figs. 156 and c. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 315 



Simmons insisted on the following points: (1) that primary folds 

 appear very early on the posterior surface of the invaginating pul- 

 monary appendage of the spider, resembling very closely in position 

 the gill-leaf development of Limulus as described by Kingsley ; and 

 (2) that such folds become the pulmonary lamellae of the adult spider. 

 But Janeck and I demonstrate that these primary lamellae of the spider 

 are only temporary, with probably no more significance than the folds 

 on the mesial surfaces of the cephalothoracal appendages, and they 

 certainly do not become the definitive lamellae of the lung-book. The 

 truth is that the secondary pulmonary plates of the spider do not 

 arise from folds on the outer surface of an appendage, but in a differ- 

 ent position from a solid cell mass after the appendage has invagi- 

 nated. 



Therefore there is nothing in the ontogeny of the lung-books of spiders 

 similar to the development of the gills of the Xiphosura, beyond that 

 they are both connected with abdominal appendages; consequently 

 no embryological ground for deriving the lung-books from gills. 



Further, objections of a theoretical nature may also be made against 

 the derivation of the lung-books from gills. First, the direct change 

 of a water-breathing organ into an air-breathing one would be almost 

 without parallel; at least I cannot recall any instance of this kind in 

 animals. Second, granted that Limulus is genetically related with 

 arachnids, a view to which I subscribe, what reason have we for 

 assuming that Limulus is the more primitive form? The only good 

 anatomical argument for this view is that Limulus retains through life 

 six pairs of abdominal appendages, and also a pair of nephridia. The 

 general reason for the primitiveness of Limulus is its marine habitude, 

 with the assumption that the ancestors of most groups must have 

 originated in the seas. The latter assumption lacks all solid basis, 

 and has been opposed by Simroth (1891) and myself (1906). But the 

 true arachnids are essentially terrestrial, quite as much as the insects 

 are, and though a few have taken to aquatic existence, such as the 

 Hydrachnids and Argyroneta, all of them breathe atmospheric air. 

 Further, true araneads occurred in the Carboniferous, in times as early 

 as the first fossil traces of Limuloids, while terrestrial scorpions existed 

 in the Silurian. These facts would indicate that the true arachnids 

 originated on the land. It would, accordingly, seem to me that if 

 Limulus be related to the arachnid stock, and this seems well estab- 

 lished, that the former represents a line of descent that has taken 

 secondarily to aquatic life ; and for this view would speak also its exist- 

 ence in shoal waters, and its behavior in laying its eggs close to the 




316 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



land. The position I have taken is in direct opposition to the general 

 one as voiced by Korschelt and Heider, "that the Arachnida have 

 developed from the Paleostraca by adaptation to land life." 



6. The Taxonomic Rank of the Theraphos.e. 



By quite general consent arachnologists consider the Aranese thera- 

 phosse to be more primitive than the Aranese vera?. I do not know 

 whether this conclusion has at any time been critically discussed, and 

 in the present place I shall touch on it only briefly and tentatively, for 

 I feel my knowledge of the families of spiders is too deficient for me to 

 attempt to make any positive decision. 



The Theraphosse differ from the Aranese verse in having the chelicera 

 directed forward instead of downward, in possessing no trachese, and 

 in having no maxillary plates on the pedipalp (except in certain 

 Atypidse). 



We cannot say whether the character of the position of the chelicera 

 is more primitive in the first case than the other. The lack of maxillary 

 plates might or might not be due to degeneration, and we have seen 

 that there is no good basis for deciding whether lung-books are more 

 primitive than trachese. 



Thus these anatomical differences in themselves furnish no good 

 answer to our question. The Liphistiids in their general structure 

 appear decidedly primitive, with their four pairs of functional spin- 

 nerets and their segmented abdominal terga; yet Simon (1908) in his 

 recent description of the male of Liphistius birmanicus has shown 

 that the palpal bulbus is much more complex than in other Therapho- 

 sids. 



Excluding the Liphistiidse, the other families of the Theraphosse, 

 namely, the Aviculariidse and the Atypidse, would seem to be degenerate 

 in one respect, that of the spinnerets. For they possess neither colulus 

 nor cribellum, and almost all the Aviculariids lack also the anterior 

 spinnerets. The great length and appendage-like appearance of the 

 posterior spinnerets in the Aviculariids might not be a primitive 

 character, but be due to compensatory growth on account of the loss 

 of the anterior spinnerets. The general small size and compact group- 

 ing of the eyes might well be the result of the usual tubicolous mode of 

 life. Further, there are certain Aranese verse (such as Filistata) 

 which show the male copulatory bulbus less complex than in the 

 Theraphosse. 



In the loss of the spinnerets of the fourth abdominal segment, 

 in the small size of the eyes, and in the occasional great volume of 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 317 



the body the Aviculariidae at least would seem to be considerably 

 modified. They might well be considered a modified branch which 

 has to great extent replaced spinning by burrowing. Few of them 

 construct true snares, and then only simple ones. Thus they might 

 stand in somewhat the same relation to the Araneae verse, as the 

 Ratitae do to the Carinatse among birds. 



While this hypothesis of the systematic rank of the Aviculariidae 

 may appear reasonable, we can hardly at the present time decide the 

 rank of the Liphistiidse and Atypidse, or indeed decide whether the 

 Theraphosse represent a homogeneous group.

THE POLYCHJETOUS ANNELIDS DEEDGED BY THE U. S. S. "ALBATROSS" OFF 



THE COAST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN 1904. L SYLLIDJE, 



SPHJERODORIDJE, HESIONIDJE AND PHYLLODOCIDJE. 



BY J. PERCY MOORE. 



Until in 1904 the U. S. Bureau of Fisheries, the University of Cali- 

 fornia, and Stanford University joined forces in initiating an investi- 

 gation of the marine biology of California upon a comprehensive 

 scale, most of the faunal work done on the invertebrates of that region 

 had been limited to the littoral zone, and much of it had been of a local 

 or desultory character. 



Early in that year the Fisheries steamer "Albatross" was detailed 

 to investigate the deeper waters off the coast of the southern half of 

 the State. From March 1 to April 15 collections and physical obser- 

 vations were made at 139 dredging stations in the region south of 

 Point Conception, chiefly in the vicinity of San Diego and among the 

 ♦Santa Catalina and Santa Barbara Islands. Between May 10 and 

 June 15, 128 dredging stations were established in Monterey Bay, 

 making 267 in all. The full data relating to these stations have been 

 compiled and published as Fisheries Document No. 604, Washington, 

 1906. 



Among the material gathered is a rich but rather indifferently 

 preserved collection of Polychaeta which was submitted to the writer 

 for study, especially through the interest of Prof. Charles H. Gilbert, 

 of Stanford University. Coming from the deeper waters, this collec- 

 tion admirably supplements the shore collections from the vicinity of 

 San Diego and Monterey Bay contained in the Stanford University 

 Museum and already reported upon in these Proceedings. It had been 

 expected that the bulk of the collections would be made up of known 

 shore forms, but the large number of undescribed species encountered 

 in the families already studied has dispelled that anticipation. Types 

 of new species are to be deposited in the National Museum, and sets of 

 cotypes and duplicates, as far as possible, also in the cooperating 

 Universities and this Academy.

at depths of from 33 fathoms to 1,400 fathoms and chiefly among the

 but some are only 12-20 mm. long. In some the eyes, and particu- 

 larly the posterior pair, are enlarged until those on each side nearly 

 meet. There are indications that this condition may be correlated 

 with bathymetrical distribution, the approximation being most marked 

 in the examples from the greatest depth and least in those from more 

 shallow waters. 



When contracted the notocirri exhibit a distinct thickening above 

 the base, when extended they taper nearly uniformly from the 

 base, but in all cases the alternation in length is obvious. Some ex- 

 amples have the anterior twenty or so segments each marked by a 

 dusky band, not narrow and sharply defined as in S. armillaris, but 

 broad and ill defined. The accessory tooth of the seta appendages is 

 frequently much worn or nearly obsolete, causing the tips to appear 

 simple. In no case do the appendages exhibit any tendency to unite 

 with the stems, as in Pionosyllis elongata Johnson and other species of 

 the Synsyllis group. 



The chitinous lining of the pharynx terminates in a thickened, some- 

 what crenulated border, behind which is a circle of soft papillae and 

 dorsally a large, blunt, conical tooth. In the retracted state the tooth 

 lies in somite III, the gizzard in XI-XXVII, the oesophageal loop in 

 XVIII and the cseca in XVII and XVIII. 



S. californica Kinberg may be this species, but no certainty can be 

 reached from the brief diagnosis. The Eusyllis tubijex Gosse reported 

 by Treadwell from near Monterey Bay is very probably this species. 

 S. violaceo-flava Grube is another related species from the Philippines.

 Syllis (EWersia) heteroohaeta sp. nov. PI. XV, figs. 1-4. 



Described from the type only, a small complete specimen 9 mm. long, 

 with a width, in the region of the gizzard, of body of .4 mm. and 

 between tips of parapodia of .7 mm. Segments 80. 



Prostomium (PI. XV, fig. 1) pentagonal, with very unequal sides, 

 the posterior longest and nearly straight, the lateral shortest and 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 323 



convex, the anterior meeting in a rounded apex; about twice as wide as 

 long. Eyes three pairs, forming a triangular group on each side; 

 the middle pair with distinct lenses and much the largest, but not more 

 than one-ninth the width of the prostomium and situated about their 

 diameter from its lateral border; the posterior also with lenses, di- 

 rected dorso-caudad, about one-fourth the diameter of the middle pair 

 and situated medio-caudad of them; the anterior 1 mere specks of pig- 

 ment without lenses situated in line with the posterior pair and equally 

 distant from the middle pair. Behind the posterior pair is a large 

 black blotch on each side. Palps prominent, projecting straight for- 

 ward, separate to the base, about one and one-half times as long as the 

 prostomium, broad at the base where they equal one-half the width 

 of the prostomium, thence diverging slightly and tapering to the rather 

 slender, bluntly rounded tips. Median tentacle arising posterior to 

 middle of prostomium between middle pair of eyes, lateral tentacles 

 close to base of palps laterad of anterior eyes; both slender, little 

 tapered, subequal, reaching about one- fifth of their length beyond 

 palps, strongly moniliform except at base, with twenty to twenty-two 

 joints. 



Peristomium (PL XV, fig. 1) a short but distinct ring bearing two 

 pairs of tentacular cirri similar to cephalic tentacles but with distinct 

 ceratophores, similar to the cephalic tentacles; the dorsal equal to 

 the latter and with twenty or twenty-one joints, the ventral two-thirds 

 as long with fourteen or fifteen joints. Segments all distinct, short, 

 uniannulate, slightly depressed, increasing in width to near the middle. 

 Pygidium a broadly expanded, furrowed ring whose cirri have been lost. 



Parapodia (PL XV, fig. 2) of a length generally about one-third the 

 width of their segments. Neuropodia thick, little compressed and 

 little tapered, divided distally into a low postsetal lip which curves 

 over and encloses the ends of tne acicula, and a slightly longer presetal 

 lip, the supraacicular portion of which is a small, blunt, projecting 

 lobe forming the dorso-distal angle of the neuropodium. Posteriorly 

 this lobe is much reduced and the postsetal lip becomes longer and 

 more pointed. Neurocirri nearly free from base of neuropodia; 

 their cirrophores small and indistinct; styles slender, tapered, blunt, 

 longer than neuropodium and with a swelling on the dorsal side above 

 the base. Posteriorly they become more slender. Notocirri strongly 

 moniliform and very distinctly jointed (though the joints become 

 cylindrical rather than spheroidal or ellipsoidal) even to the caudal 



1 Omitted from the figure. 




324 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



end; cirrophores short but generally distinct. Those on II and V 

 are the longest, about one and one-half times the dorsal tentacular 

 cirrus and exceeding the greatest width of the body ; they have twenty- 

 four to twenty-seven joints; III and IV are slightly longer than the 

 dorsal of I and have nineteen to twenty-two segments. The remaining 

 notocirri are more or less regularly alternately longer and shorter even 

 to the caudal end, the longer in general equalling about three-fourths 

 the width of their segments and the shorter about three-fifths their 

 width. Those in the middle of the body have about sixteen or seven- 

 teen (fig. 2) and eleven to thirteen (fig. 2a) joints respectively. 



Acicula (PL XV, fig. 2) of anterior parapodia in a row of six or seven, 

 the ends of which appear in a groove at the dorso-distal angle of the 

 neuropodia. They are pale yellow, rather stout, tapered and end in 

 blunt points, slightly knobbed and variously slightly bent or even 

 hooked; middle neuropodia have three or four and posterior only two. 



Setae in rough, irregular subacicular fascicles of about seven rows 

 of three or four each. They are colorless with rather long, curved 

 shafts slightly enlarged at the distal end (PI. XV, fig. 3) to form 

 simple, oblique articulations roughened by a few minute points. 

 Appendages of all except the setae of the dorsal row comparatively short 

 (fig. 3), two to four times the length of the oblique end of shaft, scarcely 

 curved and not hooked at the tip, which is a simple point below which 

 is sometimes an obscure accessory tooth; margin strongly toothed. 

 Seta? of dorsal series and sometimes one or two of the next row more 

 slender (PI. XV, fig. 4) with very long, slender, straight appendages 

 usually about four times the longest of the lower rows, with blunt 

 ends (fig. 46) and finer marginal denticulation (fig. 4a). Such setse 

 continue to the caudal end and are similar on all segments. Many of 

 the posterior parapodia also bear a single stout, nearly straight, spine- 

 like simple seta, as long as the shafts of the others, in the dorsal part 

 of the bundle; it is probably to be regarded as a prolonged aciculum. 



Proboscis (PL XV, fig. 1) protruded about one-third of its length 

 beyond palps, broad cylindroid, diameter exceeding prostomium, 

 cuticle thick, smooth and entire at orifice; dorsal tooth stout and blunt, 

 probably from wear; behind this is a circular fold bearing eight (or 

 nine?) distant, soft, rounded papillae. Gizzard reaches from IX to XXI 

 and has thirty-seven rings. Colorless in alcohol. 



The only specimen was taken at Station 4,423, off San Nicolas Island, 

 April 13, 339 fathoms, gray sand, black pebbles, shells. 



Syllis (Ehlersia) anops Ehlers, from the Straits of Magellan, is a 

 much more elongated species with the anterior and posterior dorsal 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 325 



setae appendages differing in form. S. singalisetis Grube, from the 



Philippines, also belongs to the subgenus Ehlersia, but has only four 



eyes. 



Pionosyllis typica sp. nov. PI. XV, figs. 5-7. 



Form moderately slender, widest in the region of the gizzard, from 

 which it tapers regularly to the caudal end. The well-extended and 

 complete type has 96 segments and is 31 mm. long and 1.2 mm. in 

 diameter at XXV. 



Prostomium small, somewhat sunken into peristomium, about one 

 and two-thirds times as wide as long, the greatest width posterior, 

 the sides and front broadly and regularly rounded. Eyes two pairs, 

 dark brown, small, anterior pair close to lateral border and about 

 midway of length of prostomium; posterior pair little more than one- 

 half diameter of anterior and slightly behind and within them. A 

 pair of faint ridges run from the posterior eyes to the posterior border 

 of the prostomium, nearly completing with the eyes a V-shaped figure. 



Palps completely separated to base, bent somewhat ventrad, broadly 

 triangular with rounded angles, about as long as prostomium and 

 basal width about two-thirds length. Median tentacle arising between 

 posterior eyes, about one and one-fourth times as long as prostomium 

 and palps, slender and slightly tapered, divided into about twenty- 

 four articles, distinct distally but obscure toward the base, not strongly 

 moniliform. Lateral tentacles similar, arising from a slight depression 

 just anterior to anterior eyes, nearly three-fourths as long as median 

 and reaching nearly as far, divided into nineteen or twenty joints. 

 Mouth rather large with prominent crenulated lips. 



Peristomium short and partly crowded beneath prostomium, but 

 visible for entire width of dorsum. Tentacular cirri similar to tentacles, 

 the dorsal slightly exceeding median tentacle in length, with about 

 twenty-six joints; the ventral somewhat shorter, with twenty joints. 

 Body segments nearly terete, remarkably regular but separated by 

 shallow, inconspicuous furrows ; except for a few short anterior ones they 

 are half as long as wide or more. From the maximum width at the end of 

 the first fourth they taper regularly to the pygidium, which is a small 

 ring and bears one of a pair of cirri as long as the last nine segments 

 and resembling the posterior neurocirri in being scarcely articulated. 



Parapodia (PI. XV, fig. 5) situated at ventral level of body, well 

 separated throughout, slender, rather conspicuous in ventral view but 

 largely concealed from the dorsum. The neuropodia are slightly com- 

 pressed and taper slightly to the bluntly rounded and rather abruptly 

 contracted end, which is divided into two small lips separated by a 




326 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



deep cleft, from which the setse arise and into which the tips of the 

 acicula enter. Neurocirri arise obliquely from basal half of neuropo- 

 dium, cylindrical or slightly tapered to blunt tips reaching well beyond 

 end of neuropodium, especially on anterior segments. Notocirri 

 arise from rather prominent but indistinct cirrophores immediately 

 above base of neuropodia and all at same level. Styles all approxi- 

 mately of one length, about two-thirds width of body, the anterior 

 and alternate ones scarcely longer than the others, but the alternate 

 ones carried erect. Anterior notocirri are somewhat articulated, 

 similarly to the tentacles, but this character becomes more obscure 

 toward the base and on more caudal cirri; most of them are rather 

 stout, rather quickly tapered and more or less transversely wrinkled, 

 rather than jointed. Near the caudal end they become much reduced 

 in size. 



Acicula number from five or six anteriorly to two or three posteriorly ; 

 pale yellow, tapered, the ends blunt and very slightly knobbed (PI 

 XV, fig. 6). 



Setse generally about twelve or fifteen, in oblique, spreading, fan- 

 shaped tufts; colorless, the stems long, slender, curved, the ends 

 (PI. XV, fig. 7) slightly enlarged, oblique, with four or five just per- 

 ceptible teeth on the convexity of the front face and a slight shoulder 

 behind. Appendages moderately long, varying from three times 

 diameter of distal end of stem in ventral to five times its diameter 

 in dorsal seta?, except at the posterior end, where all are shorter. 

 They (fig. 7) are of peculiar form with very oblique base, beyond which 

 the width remains nearly uniform; distally abruptly truncated and 

 ending in a stout oblique spur, above which is a delicate curved tooth 

 often nearly worn away; a very fine marginal fringe ending in a more 

 prominent tuft of hairs. 



This species stands closer to the type species than any of the three 

 already described from the Pacific coast of North America. Johnson's 

 species, P. elongata, appears to be more properly referred to Synsyllis 

 Verrill. Much confusion in the usage of the genus exists among authors . 

 Station 4,430, off Santa Cruz Island, April 14, 197 fathoms, black 

 sand and pebbles. Two specimens. 



Pionosyllis gigantea Moore. 



About forty anterior segments of a specimen of this large species 

 from an unknown locality. As noted above it is doubtful if this species 

 really belongs to Pionosyllis. 



Trypanosyllis intermedia Moore. 



Owing to the deficiencies of the type the original description of this 

 species is incomplete and may be added to here. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 327 



A complete specimen with 230 much contracted segments is 60 mm. 

 long, with a maximum body width of 3.2 mm. at XXX. Prostomium 

 subquadrate, slightly wider than long; with a deep postero-median 

 dorsal incision and furrow. Palps completely separated to base, 

 slightly longer than prostomium, somewhat divided into basal and 

 terminal portions ; the former somewhat swollen and the latter slender 

 and abruptly bent ventrad. Median tentacle five or six times length 

 of prostomium and composed of fifty-six very short joints; lateral 

 tentacles about one-half as long, with thirty-five to thirty-eight joints. 

 Eyes on each side nearly or quite coalesced. Tentacular cirri arising 

 beneath prostomium, the dorsal nearly equal to median tentacle, 

 with fifty joints; the ventral slightly shorter than lateral tentacle, 

 with about thirty-five joints. Notocirrus of II the longest, about 

 one-third more than the median tentacle, with sixty-four to seventy 

 joints; that of III scarcely shorter and of IV two-thirds as long as II. 

 Following this the notocirrophores of odd-numbered segments are at a 

 slightly higher level and bear slender styles as long as the width of 

 their segments and with as many as sixty or seventy very short joints; 

 those of even-numbered segments have styles about two-thirds as 

 long. Pygidium a tapered ring bearing a pair of slender cirri as long 

 as its diameter and with twenty-five to thirty joints. 



A pharynx dissected had the circle of teeth in somite VIII; there 

 are eighteen to twenty slender compressed soft papillae and apparently 

 as many teeth, but the latter are so much broken that this cannot be 

 determined with certainty. Gizzard in XVIII to XXIX with thirty- 

 five distinct and seven or eight indistinct rings. 



The anterior thirty-five or forty segments are reddish-brown above 

 with pale intersegmental lines. 



One specimen each from stations 4,417, off Santa Barbara Island, 

 April 12, 29 fathoms, fine yellow sand, rock and coralline; and 4.420, 

 off San Nicolas Island, April 12, 291 fathoms, gray mud and rock. 



Odontosyllis phosphorea sp. nov. PI. XV, figs. 8-10. 



Epitokous, sexually mature examples, unfortunately much dis- 

 torted and broken. The type and largest specimen lacks some of the 

 caudal segments and measures 23 mm. long, 2.5 mm. in maximum 

 width between tips of parapodia and 1.5 mm. in width of body only. 

 The anterior region of twenty-three segments is 4.6 mm. long, the 

 middle of fifty-one segments provided with swimming notopodial setse 

 is 17 mm., and only four segments of the posterior region remain, mak- 

 ing seventy-eight segments in all. A smaller, more extended and 




328 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



posteriorly complete cotype is 18 mm. long, the anterior region being 

 5 mm. and the posterior 5.5 mm. Segments 23 + 26 + 31 = 80. 



Form rather short and stout, widest at the middle, the ventral sur- 

 face flat, the dorsal more or less arched, most so in the anterior region, 

 which is nearly as high as wide; the middle and posterior regions 

 depressed. 



Prostomium small, short, bent downward, subprismatic with 

 rounded angles, about two-thirds as long as wide and deeper than long, 

 the front abruptly vertical, somewhat excavated for the tentacles. 

 Eyes two pairs, moderately large with large lenses, brown, occupying 

 sides of prostomium, the anterior pair directed chiefly forward, the 

 posterior upward. Though themselves distinct they are enveloped 

 in an irregular curved, broad band of black pigment which occupies 

 most of the lateral and posterior dorsal part of the prostomium. The 

 three tentacles arise close together, the median more dorsal, from 

 a depression in the middle of the frontal face, small, slender, unjointed, 

 subequal, somewhat exceeding length of prostomium. Palpi directed 

 ventrad, thick, fleshy separated knobs. 



Peristomium achaetous, largely concealed by prostomium, only a. 

 very short dorsal ring and larger lateral prominences showing. Two 

 pairs of tentacular cirri, unjointed but transversely wrinkled, the 

 ventral about as long as width of prostomium, the dorsal about one 

 and one-half times as long. The nuchal fold arises from the dorsum 

 of II and is a prominent, semicircular, deeply pigmented, free, mem- 

 branous flap, with a basal, width equal to one-half the segment and 

 covering the posterior part of the prostomium as far as the anterior 

 eyes. Somite II and remaining setigerous segments are uniannular 

 and well marked by irregular furrows, differing in the several regions 

 as indicated above. Pygidium a small, low, dome-shaped ring having 

 a pair of short, thick fusiform cirri. 



Parapodia, owing partly to the contraction of the specimens, very 

 little prominent, those of the anterior and posterior regions uniramous 

 (PI. XV, fig. 8), of the middle region biramous (fig. 9). Neuropodia 

 short, stout, with blunt ends, terminating in two short, thick, rounded 

 lips, of which the postsetal is usually slightly the longer; both termi- 

 nating dorsally at the acicula, which lie slightly below the dorsal border 

 of the neuropodia. In the middle region the neuropodia (PI. XV, fig. 9) 

 are somewhat longer than in the anterior region, but otherwise similar. 

 The notopodia are low, flattened protuberances pushed out anterior 

 to the seta tuft into a pointed, conical acicular process. In the 

 posterior region the parapodia are neuropodial only and are gradually 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 329 



reduced in size. Neurocirri arise from beneath the base and rather 

 on the posterior face of the neuropodia, and have somewhat swollen 

 bases and a small, slightly distinct distal piece reaching about as far 

 as the end of the neuropodium. They are similar on all parapodia. 

 Notocirri arising from low swellings (but not distinct cirrophores) 

 on the dorsum well above the parapodia. Styles rather long, slender 

 and unjointed, but more or less wrinkled. The first (on II) is longer 

 than the others, about twice the dorsal peristomial cirrus and about 

 one and one- third the width of the segment; that of III is less than 

 two- fifths, of IV about three-fifths and of V about seven-eighths of 

 that of II; remaining notocirri are alternately longer and shorter, 

 those in the middle region being respectively about equal to three- 

 fifths and one-third the width of their segments. 



Neuropodial acicula generally two in anterior, three in middle 

 region, moderately stout, straight, tapered, the ends slightly knobbed. 

 Notopodial aciculum single, slender, gently tapered and curved, the 

 distal end slightly knobbed and often bent at the end. Neuropodial 

 setse entirely subacicular, in dense fascicles of several ranks, rather 

 numerous, usually ten or eleven ranks of three or four each. They are 

 colorless, rather stout, with curved stems becoming thicker distally 

 and ending obliquely in a blunt, slightly roughened point (PI. XV, 

 fig. 10). Appendages short broad blades varying in length only from 

 once to twice the width of the distal end of the stem, the longest occur- 

 ring in anterior parapodia and the ventral part of the bundles, termi- 

 nating in a prominent hook, well below which is a stout spur. In the 

 posterior region a solitary slender, curved simple seta also occurs in 

 each fascicle, but has not been detected elsewhere. 



A dissected proboscis exhibits the characteristic thick bow and fold 

 of the chitinous rim, but the number and character of the teeth is not 

 evident. The gizzard of the same specimen has sixty-seven annulations. 



Color pale yellow with a conspicuous spot on the prostomium, the 

 nuchal fold and narrow intersegmental transverse lines black; in the 

 middle and posterior regions every fourth one of the latter is much 

 wider and denser, and at these deeply pigmented furrows the frequent 

 fractures of the body- walls always occur; appendages colorless; 

 eyes brown. 



The label reads: "Phosphorescent annelids caught at surface, Avalon 

 Bay, Catalina Island, evening, April 11, 1904, Albatross." Professor 

 William S. Ritter writes that a phosphorescent annelid swarms at the 

 surface of San Diego Bay. Doubtless this is the species here described. 

 It is a frequent characteristic of species of this genus to be luminiferous.

Syllid gen. et sp.? 



A small syllid, probably a true Syllis or Eusyllis, from an unknown 

 station, cannot be identified, and its characters are put on record for 

 the use of a future describer. 

 Length 11 mm., segments 72. 



Prostomium nearly twice as wide as long, rounded laterally, slightly 

 convex anteriorly and nearly straight posteriorly. Eyes very imper- 

 fect (probably abnormal), represented by a minute speck of pigment 

 close to the base of the palp on one side, and a larger but still very small 

 eye with a lens on the other side. No trace of tentacles remains, but 

 it seems very improbable that they should be normally absent in a 

 syllid of this type. Palps projecting forward and curved downward 

 pistally, free, broad, subelliptical, flattened, their length nearly equal 

 to width of prostomium, and their combined width exceeding that of 

 prostomium. 



Peristomium very short above, swelling to a broad lip at the sides 

 and below. An incomplete, strongly moniliform, dorsal tentacular 

 cirrus with seventeen joints remaining exists on one side, but the others 

 are lost. 



Body strongly arched anteriorly, but more flattened behind. First 

 twelve segments very short and separated by deep furrows, the others 

 becoming longer until in the middle region they are one-fourth as long- 

 as wide. Pygidium a very short ring with a slight median lobe, bear- 

 ing a pair of very long, slender, moniliform cirri as long as the last 

 twelve segments and consisting of more than forty joints; in addition 

 there is a very minute unjointed median cirrus. 



Parapodia small, the neuropodia cylindroid, little compressed, 

 truncate, the distal end divided into nearly equal, short, thick, rounded 

 presetal and postsetal lips. Neurocirri rather slender, tapered, un- 

 jointed, blunt, reaching slightly beyond end of neurocirri. Notocirri 

 arising from prominent swellings and small cirrophores well above 

 neuropodia; very long, flexible, very strongly moniliform, alternately 

 longer (on odd-numbered segments) and shorter (even-numbered 

 segments). At the anterior end mostly lost; on middle segments the 

 short ones exceed the width of their segments and have thirty-five or 

 forty joints, the long ones are twice the width of their segments and 

 have fifty to fifty-five joints. Even near the caudal end they are not 

 much shorter, the longest having forty or more joints and the short 

 ones twenty-five or thirty. 



Acicula three or four in a row ending at the dorso-lateral angle, pale 

 yellow, tapered to blunt, slightly knobbed tips. Setse few, seldom 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 331 



exceeding ten or twelve and oftener fewer, colorless, transparent, with 

 rather stout, curved stems, terminating in enlarged, oblique ends 

 which appear to be quite smooth. Appendages usually about twice 

 as long as the oblique end of stem, with straight, simple points and 

 strongly developed marginal fringe. Parapodia of the last thirty 

 segments at least bear a single simple spine which projects prominently 

 from the dorsal part of the bundle. It has about twice the thickness 

 of the compound seta?, is very slightly curved and ends in a blunt 

 point. The most posterior project very prominently to quite the 

 length of the compound setae; further forward they are less conspicu- 

 ous, and anterior to XL none can be detected. 



Proboscis retracted and on account of the opacity and pigmentation 

 of the anterior end difficult to see. It appears, however, to have a 

 smooth margin. Gizzard in XV to XXII, with thirty-four rings. 



Color anteriorly pale brown owing to numerous granules in the 

 integument, passing through yellow into a nearly colorless posterior 

 end. 

 Autolytus sp.? 



A single example of a stock regenerating behind and incomplete 

 from the loss of many of the appendages. Length 16 mm., width 

 between tips of parapodia 1.4 mm.; segments 85 with a narrow 

 regenerating bud of 13 segments. 



Prostomium broadly ellipsoid, anterior and posterior borders nearly 

 straight, sides prominently convex; with the palps as seen from above 

 the outline nearly circular. Eyes two pairs with lenses, the anterior 

 nearly black, diameter about one-fifth width of prostomium, located 

 midway of the length of prostomium at its lateral borders, looking 

 outward and a little downward and forward; posterior brown, about 

 one-half diameter of anterior, with which they are in contact on the 

 dorso-postero-median side. Palps completely coalesced to tips, but 

 having a depressed median line and barely perceptible distal emar- 

 gination. Median tentacle lost, but one lateral tentacle present, arising 

 just above base of palp nearly in line with anterior eye, coarse, little 

 tapered, its length six or seven times prostomium and palps, but much 

 twisted and probably incomplete. 



Peristomium bearing large cirrophores, but only the ventral style 

 of one side remaining, this being one-half the length of the lateral 

 tentacle. Anterior segments imperfectly separated, the furrows 

 shallow; width increasing for about twenty segments to the gizzard 

 region and then nearly uniform to the end. A wedge-shaped median 

 elevation with apex at the peristomium extends over the first six or 




332 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [J line, 



seven segments, and is bounded by the divergent epaulettes which ex- 

 tend caudad from the peristomium and have pigmented borders. The 

 regenerating region is quite small, barely a mm. in length and about 

 one-fourth that in width, and ends in an unsegmented blunt pygidium 

 without cirri. 



Parapodia, as usual in the genus, short, thick, ventral in position, 

 lacking free neurocirri which become coalesced with the neuropodia to 

 form opaque ventral swellings ; neuropodia terminating in short, thick, 

 presetal and postsetal lips. Notocirri with large cirrophores, often as 

 large as the neuropodia; styles unjointed, coarse and similar to the 

 tentacle, very easily detached and many missing. That of II very long, 

 about twice the lateral tentacle and reaching to about XX; that of 

 III about one-half as long; the others much shorter, the longest about 

 one-half III or about width of body. 



Acicula four (on one parapodium studied), tapered to blunt points. 

 Setae forming rather dense tufts, colorless, the shafts rather stout, 

 strongly curved, distally enlarged and near the articulation denticu- 

 lated on both faces. Appendages little longer than oblique end of 

 shaft, triangular with bidentate ends, the anterior tooth larger and 

 somewhat hooked. 



No teeth visible at end of retracted proboscis, oesophagus scarcely 

 looped; gizzard in XX-XXVIII, apparently about thirty-three 

 rings. No color. 



The single specimen comes from an unknown station. 



SPH^RODORID^E. 



Although at least five generic names have been applied to the few 

 known species of this very small family, it seems that the forms possess- 

 ing compound setae still lack proper generic designation. Indeed, if 

 the synonymies published by European authors be correct, all of these 

 names are based upon a single type species. As each was originally 

 proposed for a single species, there is no difficulty about fixing the types. 

 Three names were proposed in 1843: Ephesia Rathke for E. gracilis 

 Rathke (n. sp.), Sphwrodorum Oersted for S. flavum Oersted (n. sp.) 

 and Bebrycc Johnston for P. peripatus Johnston (n. sp.). Ephesia 

 was previously used by Hiibner in 1816 for a genus of Lepidoptera, and 

 Bebryce is preoccupied by Bebryce Philippi, 1842. Nothing in the 

 descriptions of the types serves to differentiate them ; they all certainly 

 have simple setae and lack spherical organs other than those directly 

 related to the parapodia. Two years later Johnston, discovering 

 the earlier use of Bebryce, substituted Pollicita, but admits the prob- 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 333 



able identity of his type species with Sphcerodorum flavum Oersted. 

 Perrier in 1897 proposed Hypephesia for species with simple seta?, 

 naming H. gracilis as the type. 



Levinsen employs Ephesia to include both typical species with 

 simple seta? like E. gracilis Rathke and forms with compound seta? 

 like E. peripatus Claparede (non Johnston), while Sphcerodorum is 

 retained for those species which bear several series of spherical append- 

 ages with granular contents and which have the setse compound, like 

 S. claparedii Greeff. St. Joseph, on the other hand, prefers to sepa- 

 rate the genera on the basis of seta? characters, ranging under Ephesia 

 species with simple seta? and under Sphcerodorum those with the setse 

 compound. Finally Perrier recognizes the three generic types apparent 

 in the family, retains Levinsen's application of Sphcerodorum but divides 

 his Ephesia, unfortunately applying that name to the E. peripatus 

 group and giving a new name {Hypephesia) to the typical E. gracilis 

 with simple setse. 



It is evident, therefore, that Sphcerodorum is the proper name for 

 the papillated forms with simple setse only, and, so far as I am aware, no 

 distinct tenable generic names are in existence for the two types with 

 compound setse. 



The present collection includes a species of each of the three types 

 known in the family, but all are provisionally placed in the genus 

 Sphcerodorum, a proceeding that may be justified because the known 

 number of species is so small that no confusion will result from plac- 

 ing all in a single genus, because increased knowledge of the species of 

 the family may make known forms possessing intermediate characters, 

 and because the relationships of the Sphserodorida? have been so 

 variously conceived that it is possible that other generic names have 

 been overlooked. 

 Sphaerodorum papillifer sp. nov. PL XV, tigs. 11, 12. 



Moderately slender, tapering both ways, the greatest width nearer 

 the anterior end, subterete, but somewhat depressed and flattened 

 below. Length of type 30 mm. ; maximum diameter at end of anterior 

 two-fifths 1 mm.; segments 102. Other specimens one or two milli- 

 meters shorter. 



Anterior end blunt, the prostomium and peristomium retracted and 

 difficult to distinguish, the former a very short, simple, slightly domed 

 lobe studded with papilla? and without definite appendages, though 

 three papillse longer than the others may represent the tentacles and a 

 pair of mammilliform papillse the palps. Peristomium a simple, not 

 clearly differentiated ring surrounding the mouth and bearing a pair 




334 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



of small globoid cirri. On the dorsum is a <-shaped group of con- 

 spicuous black eye-spots which extend on to somite II. Typically 

 there seem to be two pairs, but frequently there is an additional pair 

 of spots or a median spot anteriorly. 



Segments short and uniannular or slightly and irregularly annulated, 

 mobile and irregularly contracted in the different regions; posteriorly 

 becoming very small and tapering into a minute pygidium which bear 

 a pair of spherical cirri with small apical papillse and in addition a 

 minute median cirrus or papilla. Surface, particularly toward the 

 ends of the body, bearing numerous small, pointed or somewhat clavate 

 retractile papillse which are evidently of a sensory nature and become 

 larger in the neighborhood of the parapodia. 



Parapodia (PL XV, fig. 11) rather inconspicuous, lateral, probably 

 uniramous. They consist of a slender, conical setigerous neuropodium 

 roughened with small, conical, sensory papillse becoming longer towards 

 its distal end, which terminates in an especially prominent one or 

 postsetal lobe. A much stouter process arising from the postero- 

 ventral. region of the neuropodium, having nearly the structure of the 

 sensory papillse, is undoubtedly the neurocirrus. Quite distinct from 

 and well dorsad of the neuropodium is a spherical prominence (noto- 

 podium?) bearing on the middle of the distal face a small clavate 

 cirrus. The spherical body is largest and most conspicuous on middle 

 segments, but the distal cirrus is larger, both relatively and absolutely, 

 at the ends. These organs are enveloped in a thick cuticle and the 

 interior is filled with a snarl of slender, elongated bodies and opaque 

 brownish granules, giving to the entire organ its characteristic opacity. 

 A short distance farther dorsad is a clavate papillse similar to that 

 borne by the spherical body but more slender and elongated, especially 

 on middle segments. 



Neuropodial aciculum single — a rather stout, yellowish, tapered 

 spine ending in a simple, blunt, somewhat projecting point. Setae 

 few, about four to six, projecting unequal distances in an irregular 

 fascicle in each neuropodium (fig. 11). All are simple, colorless, rather 

 stout, the shafts straight or nearly so, the ends expanded into a blade- 

 like extremity with a knife-like edge rising into a slightly curved point 

 and passing at the base into a slightly differentiated lateral spur. 

 They exhibit little variety in shape or proportions (PI. XV, fig. 12). 



Proboscis unknown. Color nearly uniform pale yellow, faded, the 

 eye-spots deep brown. 



Six specimens from station 4,400, off San Diego, April 8, 500 fathoms 

 green mud. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 335 



One is a female filled with large eggs distinctly visible to the naked 

 eye; the others, including the type, appear to be males. 



Sphaerodorum brevicapitis sp. nov. PI. XV, figs. 13, 14. 



Although considerably larger this species closely resembles S. 

 papillifer in general appearance. The type and only specimen, much 

 contracted and distorted, is 39 mm. long, with a maximum diameter 

 without parapodia of 1.6 mm., and has 96 segments. 



Owing to the partial protrusion of the proboscis as a soft bulbous 

 structure the prostornium is crowded dorsad. It appears as a very 

 slight, scarcely distinguishable lobe, bearing scattered papilla?, of 

 which five, though still small, are larger than the others ; three of these 

 are very close together near the anterior margin of the lip ; the others 

 are separated by a considerable interval on each side. 



Peristomium likewise indistinct — a short achaetous ring bearing a 

 minute mammilliform papilla on each side. A pair of rather large, 

 widely separated pigment spots, the remains of a pair of eyes, lies 

 partly on this segment but chiefly on III. Owing to the condition of 

 the specimen little can be determined about the normal appearance of 

 the segments. The cutaneous papilla?, however, are less numerous 

 and smaller than in S. papillifer. They are scattered fairly uniformly 

 over the surface, becoming more numerous on the parapodia. Pygi- 

 dium a minute ring bearing a pair of low, broad, mammilliform papilla?, 

 besides at least two small, simple papilla?. 



Parapodia (PI. XV, fig. 13) in general similar to those of S. papillifer, 

 but the parts more widely separated and the neuropodia more slender 

 and cylindrical with a conical apex, rather than simply conical, and 

 ending in a small postacicular lobe. Neurocirri small, subcorneal 

 processes arising from the posterior ventral side of the neuropodia just 

 at the base of the terminal cone. Spherical organ prominent, with a 

 thinner cuticle than in S. papillifer, and the papilla borne on the ventral 

 side of the base instead of on the outer surface. Dorsal papilla (noto- 

 cirrus) well above spherical organ, small, claviform, with a widened 



base. 



Aciculum single, rather more slender than that of S. papillifer, 

 but similar in form, colorless, the blunt-pointed tip projecting freely. 

 Seta? in irregular fascicles of usually eight or nine, rather prominent, 

 all compound or semi-compound, becoming widened and flattened 

 distally and then tapering into a hooked tip or appendage which is 

 articulated to the stem by an oblique joint, the absence of which would 

 leave these seta? very similar to those of S. papillifer (PI. XV, fig. 14).

Proboscis — see above. Color slightly yellowish ; opaque from pres- 

 ence of sperm-balls with which coelom is packed.

 2,045 fathoms, blue-gray mud. 



Sphserodorum sphaerulifer sp. now 



Fragment of caudal end of a species related to S. claparedii Greeff, 

 but with the large spherical bodies more numerous. It is dark brown 

 and very opaque. Each segment bears on the dorsum two or three 

 pairs of large, and alternating with them smaller, spheroidal bodies, 

 all partially united at their bases into a somewhat irregular trans- 

 verse ridge. The smaller numbers are at the posterior end, and they 

 increase regularly as far as the piece extends to the middle segments. 

 Several similar but smaller bodies occur on the venter. Neuropodia 

 generally similar to those of S. brevicapitis, but the very extensile 

 neurocirri and postacicular lobes are much larger, a papilla appears 

 to be absent from the notopodial organ and the first (a smaller cne) 

 of the transverse series of dorsal appendages may be the notocirrus 

 of each segment. Setae compound, similar to those of S. brevicapitis, 

 but with the joint more distinct and the appendage somewhat longer. 



The single specimen, included among some invertebrates presented 

 to the Academy by Professor Harold Heath, was taken from a deep- 

 sea fish-line in Monterey Bay on July 16, 1902. 



HESIONIDJB. 

 Podarke pugettensis Johnson. 



About a dozen specimens with up to fifty-eight segments and except 

 for the eyes devoid of pigment. One is regenerating the caudal end. 

 Many have the proboscis, which has not been described, protruded. 

 It measures about 1.5 mm. long and half as wide, the basal two-thirds 

 swollen, bulbous and smooth, the distal portion subcylindrical or trun- 

 cated conical and more or less compressed; terminal orifice a vertical 

 slit surrounded by eight or ten faintly marked small papilla?. 



The first mention of this species in literature is under the name of 

 Ophiodromus by Harrington and Griffin as a parasite on Asterias 

 in Puget Sound. 



San Diego Bay, Beacon No. 3 Shoal, March 1, 1904. 



PHYLLODOCIDiE . 



Phyllodoce mucosa Oersted. 



This species, already recorded from the North Pacific, appears to be 

 common off southern California. Most of the specimens are well 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 337 



preserved and agree closely with typical examples of the species taken 

 in the North Atlantic at Labrador and Greenland, as well as with the 

 figures of Malmgren and other European authors. The only apparent 

 difference is that the Pacific examples may have one or two more papil- 

 lae in some of the rows on the proboscis, most of them having 11 or 12 

 in the upper and lower and 13 or 14 or rarely 15 in the middle rows. 

 None shows any trace of a median dorsal series, but the other papilla? 

 are prominent and generally have a conspicuous brown spot on the 

 posterior face. The form of the prostomium is very changeable and 

 may be pyramidal, ovate or deeply cordate, but is always more or less 

 emarginate posteriorly. The nuchal papilla is minute and inconspicu- 

 ous. Several specimens are regenerating lost caudal ends and one is 

 filled with eggs. 



Seven specimens from station 4,399, off San Diego, April 7, 245 

 fathoms, fine gray sand and rock; and one from each of the following: 

 4,445, Monterey Bay, May 11, 66 fathoms, green mud; 4,476, same, 

 May 16, 39 fathoms, soft green mud; 4,482, same, May 17, 43 fathoms, 

 soft green mud; 4,485, same, 108 fathoms, soft green mud and sand;

Phyllodoce medipapillata Moore. 



The median dorsal series of proboscidial papillae is always well 

 developed and quite as conspicuous as the others. Besides this charac- 

 ter this species is distinguished from the related P. mucosa by having 

 the setae .appendages much shorter and the notocirri ovate-lanceolate 

 instead of truncated as in that species. The large specimen is just 

 100 mm. long with 201 segments. 



A single example was collected at each of the following stations: 

 4,420, off San Nicolas Island, April 12, 33 fathoms, fine gray sand; 4,460, 

 Monterey Bay, May 12, 55 fathoms, green mud, gravel ; 4,558, Monterey 

 Bay, June 9, 40 fathoms, rock. 



Phyllodoce ferruginea sp. no v. PI. XV, figs. 15-18. 



Two complete specimens of nearly equal size. The type measures 

 46 mm. long, .7 mm. in maximum width of body and 1.2 mm. between 

 tips of parapodia; 148 segments. Very slender, nearly linear, widest 

 about end of anterior third, somewhat depressed. 



Prostomium (PI. XV, fig. 15) regularly elliptical, about five-sixths 



as wide as long, slightly depressed, slightly truncated at both ends 



and with a very slight posterior median emargination, strongly convex 



above. Eyes one pair, brown, very large with prominent lenses, 



22 




338 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



their diameter nearly one-third width of prostomium, situated just 

 posterior to middle of length close to posterior borders of prosto- 

 mium and looking dorso-laterad. Frontal tentacles arising by re- 

 stricted bases, widely separated on antero-lateral borders of prosto- 

 mium, long, slender and subulate, tapered regularly from above base 

 to slender tip ; the dorsal one and one-half times or more the length of 

 prostomium, the ventral about as long as prostomium. Study of 

 additional material may modify the last statement, as some of the 

 tentacles of both specimens have evidently suffered injury and one 

 (type) has two, the cotype one, in regeneration as small knob-like buds. 

 The cells of the prostomium form a small rosette-like radiation anterior 

 to the eyes, but there is no indication of a median tentacle. 



Peristomium completely crowded beneath prostomium, projecting 

 as lateral lobes merely, from the upper part of which arise the two pairs 

 of tentacular cirri. No nuchal papilla. Posterior lip prominent. 

 Somites II and III very short but distinct, except that ventrally the 

 former coalesces with the prostomium to form the lower lip. Tentacu- 

 lar cirri (fig. 15) all unusually long and slender, regularly tapered, with 

 well-developed cirrophores. The peristomial arises at about the level 

 of the foliaceous notocirri and reaches to about XII; the dorsal of II 

 is at a higher level and reaches XVII; ventral of II at a very low level 

 and equals peristomial; that of III at nearly the level of succeeding 

 notocirri and reaches XIV. Three or four small setse arise from a small 

 tubercle between the cirri of II and a fully developed neuropodium 

 occurs on III. Anterior segments all very short and distinctly 

 biannulate; farther back they become nearly half as long as wide. 

 Pygidium a rather long ring, but cirri wanting. 



Parapodia (PI. XV, fig. 16) unusually small, projecting very little 

 from side of body, the neuropodium flattened, with postsetal lip obso- 

 lete and preset al lip large and broadly rounded distally with a very 

 slight notch, from which the point of the aciculum projects (fig. 17). 

 Xeurocirrus very strongly foliaceous, broadly subovate, several times 

 larger than neuropodium on all somites, completely concealing them 

 from behind and bending dorsad until on most somites it meets the 

 notocirrus; arrangement of veins radial. Notocirrophores prominent, 

 somewhat flattened domes, two or three times as large at the neuro- 

 podia on middle segments. Strongly foliaceous, thin, imbricated but 

 covering only a small part of the sides of the body, of moderate size 

 but very large in comparison with the neuropodia, broadly cordate 

 with apex bluntly rounded (usually broader at the end than the one 

 figured) and base deeply excavated, with deep } T ellow-brown vein- 

 forming a dense bipinnate figure; rather easily detached. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 339 



Aciculum single, nearly colorless, straight, tapered to a point like 

 a sharpened pencil which projects slightly beyond the acicular notch 

 (fig. 17). Setae rather numerous, in broad, fan-shaped fascicles only 

 obscurely divided into supra- and subacicular groups; 8 -t- 11 on 

 somite X, 9 + 12 on XXV and L, 7 4- 9 on C of type. They are 

 colorless with moderately long stems scarcely reaching beyond the 

 border of the neurocirri of middle segments, slender and gently curved, 

 rather conspicuously inflated at the ends (PL XV, fig. 18) to form a 

 socket bounded by lateral ranks of slender teeth connected anteriorly 

 by a row of much smaller teeth. Appendages rather long, equalling 

 or generally exceeding depth of neuropodia, very delicate with striations 

 and marginal denticulations not visible under the magnification shown. 



Color generally rusty, the body pale with little color, the cephalic- 

 appendages and neurocirri deeper and the notocirri very brilliant 

 }>"ellowish brown which contrasts strongly with the paler body and 

 gives the worm its conspicuous coloring. Proboscis unknown. 



Station 4.550, Monterey Bay, June 7, 50 fathoms, green mud, rock. 



In form of the prostomium and other features this species approaches 

 P. citrina Malmgren. 



Phyllodoce (Carobia) castanea Marenzeller. 



A small example 26 mm. long with 106 segments. Like the specimen 

 previously reported from Monterey Bay this one has notocirri some- 

 what more elongated than those of Marenzeller's Japanese types. 

 The color is paler and more yellowish than in the specimen above 

 mentioned, though, like it, this is a female with eggs. There is no 

 trace of a nuchal papilla and the flattening of the tentacular cirri is 

 very obvious. 



Phyllodoce polyphylla Ehlers, from South Georgia, is probably closely 

 related to this species, though Ehler's figure exhibits no setigerous 

 lobe on II, which is very obvious in this specimen. The minute dorsal 

 tentacles shown by the type of P. polyphylla are probably merely the 

 result of these being in process of regeneration after having been lost, 

 as I have seen precisely similar conditions in several species. 



Station 4,496, Monterey Bay, May 19, 10 fathoms, fine gray sand and 

 rock. 

 Anaitis polynoides sp. nov. PI. XVI, tigs. 19-21. 



Owing to the closely imbricated manner in which the large notocirri 

 overlap the slender body this species bears a superficial resemblance to 

 an elongated Polynoe or even more to a Sthendais. The single speci- 

 men is complete, but the posterior one-fourth of the body has evidently 




340 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



been recently regenerated — being abruptly unpigmented and of smaller 

 size. 



Form slender, depressed, the segments scarcely exceeding one-third 

 of total width between margins of notocirri or tips of parapodia. 

 From the maximum width at the end of the anterior fourth the extreme 

 outline tapers slightly forward and regularly and continuously caudad. 

 Length 44 mm.; maximum width of segments 1.6 mm.; total width 

 3.8 mm. Segments 88. 



Prostomium very short, broad and depressed, decidedly bent down- 

 ward. In the figure (PI. XVI, fig. 19) the prostomium is represented 

 as pressed upward somewhat, but in the position in which it naturally 

 rests the anterior outline is regularly semicircular and the length 

 (exclusive of the posterior prolongation) about one-half the width. 

 From the slightly convex posterior margin a median prolongation fits 

 into a deep depression in the peristomium and bears a knob-like nuchal 

 cirrus having a diameter about equal to the eyes. Eyes one pair, con- 

 spicuous, circular, brown, about one-ninth or one-eighth the width of 

 the prostomium and widely separated by an interval of about five 

 times their diameter, close to the posterior margin of the prostomium. 

 Frontal tentacles very short, subcorneal with small terminal append- 

 ages, very widely separated and somewhat reflexed on sides of prosto- 

 mium ; the dorsal about as long as one-third width of prostomium and 

 separated by about twice their length; the ventral somewhat longer, 

 nearer together and reflexed so that they are concealed in dorsal views. 



Peristomium somewhat tumid laterally, but excavated dorso-medially 

 for the nuchal projection and papilla, almost indistinguishably 

 coalesced with II which is similarly tumid laterally but lacks a median 

 depression. 



Tentacular cirri four pairs, rather short, thick, blunt, and stiff. 

 The first (or peristomial) pair scarcely longer than width of prostomium 

 and not reaching beyond IV; dorsal of II with a much larger cerato- 

 phore and reaching VII ; ventral of II equal to peristomial and that 

 of III (notocirrus) similar to dorsal of II and reaching VIII. 



Podous segments well defined, very regular, the anterior very short, 

 but soon becoming one-third as long as wide, slightly convex above, 

 flat below, with a shallow neural groove. Posteriorly the segments 

 taper to a very minute pygidium bearing a pair of relatively stout, 

 cylindroid anal cirri, the combined width of which equals that of the 

 pygidium and the length the last five or six segments. 



Parapodia (PL XVI, fig. 20) begin on III, strictly lateral, prominent, 

 their length exceeding one-half width of body, toward the ends becom- 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 341 



ing smaller but otherwise unmodified. Strictly uniramal, the neuro- 

 podia compressed, with obsolete postsetal lip and prominent, foliaceous 

 presetal lip divided by an acicular notch into a larger, broadly-rounded, 

 supra-acicular lobe and a somewhat shorter subacicular lobe obliquely 

 tapered to a blunt point. 



Notocirrophores large, those of all except most anterior segments 

 flattened and auriculate (fig. 20), Notocirrostyles beginning with IV, 

 thin and membranous; typically broadly lunate-reniform, the exter- 

 nal border squarish, very regularly, closely and broadly imbricated, 

 covering and concealing the parapodia and posteriorly the entire 

 dorsum, but leaving the middle of the segments exposed anteriorly. 

 Toward the anterior end the styles approach a circular form and become 

 gradually smaller until practically the entire dorsum is left uncovered. 

 The notocirrus of III is the last tentacular cirrus, while the neurocirrus 

 of the same segment differs in no respect from those following. Neuro- 

 cirrophores prominent swellings at base of ventral side of neuropodia. 

 Neurostyles (fig. 20) oblong elliptical, with the broad distal end sub- 

 truncate, foliaceous, about equalling the neuropodia in size and reach- 

 ing to or, on anterior parapodia, beyond their ends. 



Aciculum single, stout, pale yellow, gently curved, with simple 

 bluntly pointed tip. Setse (PL XVI, fig. 21) colorless, numerous (about 

 30, equally divided between supra- and subacicular groups on middle 

 segments), in a broad, fan-shaped fascicle. Shafts slender, slightly 

 curved, slightly enlarged at the end; the very asymmetrical socket 

 prolonged on one side into a great spine with a few small teeth on its 

 base ; the other side bearing a shoulder for articulation of the append- 

 age which is supported by a thin, scale-like process slightly fimbriated 

 at the end. Appendages long, about equal to the depth of the neuro- 

 podia, slender and delicate with the margin very finely but distinctly 

 denticulated. The form of the articulation resembles the Eteone 

 type. 



Color generally, including prostomium and four anterior segments, 

 under parts, parapodia, lateral parts of notocirri and posterior fourth 

 of body, pale yellowish or j^ellowish ashy; exposed part of dorsum 

 rich purplish-red with a fine blue-green iridescence. Inner thirds of 

 notocirri rich brown, together forming a pair of broad stripes extending 

 continuously for the anterior three-fourths and becoming darker anter- 

 iorly. Tentacular cirri except colorless tips, largely of a somewhat 

 darker brown. Eyes dark brown. 



Proboscis unknown. The type is a female containing half-grown ova 

 which largely fill the ccelom and enter the cavities of the parapodia and 

 notocirrophores.

Eumida tubiformis sp. nov. PL XVI, figs. 22, 23. 



All of the specimens are contracted and in this state are depressed 

 and stout, with the segments much crowded, particularly at the 

 anterior end. The type, a female with 137 segments, is 67 mm. long, 

 with a maximum body width of 3.1 mm. and a width between tips of 

 parapodia of 4.5 mm. A male with 104 segments is 37 mm. long, and 

 a small portion of the anterior end of a very large example measures 

 7 mm. between the tips of the setae. 



Prostomium in the several specimens varying in degree of contraction 

 and proportions, in the type and most of the others being nearly twice 

 as wide as long, subelliptical, slightly concave posteriorly and with a 

 tentaculiferous prominence in front, the prominent lateral ocular lobes 

 resting upon the peristomium. One specimen has the prostomium 

 subtriangular and only about one-fourth wider than long. In life it 

 would probably be broadly cordate. Eyes one pair, very large, about 

 one-fourth, or somewhat less, the width of the prostomium, with large 

 lenses looking upward. Immediately behind and below them are the 

 small nuchal sense organs. 



Frontal tentacles arising close together on front of prostomium 

 separated by a distance of about one-fourth width of prostomium, 

 all subulate with basal half thickened and beyond that abruptly tapered 

 to very slender tips, subequal or the ventral pair somewhat longer, 

 slightly exceeding one-half width of prostomium. Median tentacle 

 arising from a slight depression between lenses of eyes, not abruptly 

 thickened at base, more slender and slightly longer than frontal 

 tentacles. 



Peristomium much shortened, crowded beneath prostomium, not 

 visible as a distinct segment from above ; somites II and III also much 

 shortened and crowded. Tentacular cirri with well-developed cirro- 

 phores and large stout subulate styles shaped like the median tentacle 

 but very much larger. Dorsal and ventral of II widely separated, the 

 ventral being at nearly the level of the notocirri of succeeding somites. 

 The single pairs of I and III lie opposite the interval between those 

 of II, the peristomial being at the higher level. That of I reaches VI, 

 ventral of II reaches VIII and dorsals of II and III reach IX. 



Body of very uniform diameter, being perhaps widest at about XL, 

 thence tapered very gradually and regularly caudad. Owing to the 

 maimer in which the notocirri are imbricated an aspect of rather strong 

 depression results, but the body is really very little depressed. Seg-

ments arched above, flattened below with a slight neural ridge, dis- 

 tinctly biannulate dorsally with small intersegmental rings. Pygidram 

 a very small, slightly thickened and rugous ring. 



Normal setigerous parapodia (PL XVI, fig. 22) begin on III, 

 but a small tubercle bearing a few setse lies between the cirri of II. 

 They arise at the ventral level of the segments and are prominent, 

 being from more than one-third to one-half the width of their segments. 

 Neuropodium somewhat compressed, supported by a single aciculum, 

 the postsetal lobe nearly obsolete, presetal well developed, divided by 

 an acicular notch into a supra- and a subacicular lobe, both rounded on 

 anterior but bluntly pointed on posterior parapodia. 



Neurocirri broadly foliaceous, ovate with bluntly pointed tip and 

 oblique base attached to a low cirrophore, reaching to or beyond end 

 of neuropodium which they exceed in width and overlap and conceal 

 from behind. The} 7 are relatively much larger on anterior somites 

 where they equal one-half the notocirri, diminishing to one-fourth the 

 notocirri posteriorly. Notocirrophores low and broad. Notocirro- 

 styles (PI. XVI, fig. 22) of moderate size, broadly foliaceous and im- 

 bricated over bases of parapodia, leaving most of the dorsum of body 

 exposed. They are broadly cordate with blunt apex and nearly 

 symmetrical base, the anterior ones broader, often wider than long and 

 blunter, the posterior tending to more acute, cuneate, longer, less 

 cordate forms, with the length as much as one and one-third times the 

 width. 



Aciculum single, yellow, stout, tapered, straight or slightly curved 

 and ending in a simple blunt point at the acicular notch. Setae in a 

 single vertical series spreading fanwise and only very slightly separated 

 at the acicular notch into supra- and subacicular groups. On the 

 type they are distributed as follows: somite X, 13 supra- and 21 sub- 

 acicular; XXV, 14 and 25; L, 11 and 24; LXXV, 11 and 17; and C, 

 8 and 14. 



They are nearly colorless, with slender slightly curved stems scarcel}' 

 enlarged at the ends (PI. XVI, fig. 23) to form an imperfect asymmetri- 

 cal socket, the best developed side of which is broadly rounded and 

 provided with a uniform series of slender teeth. Appendages of 

 moderate length, very uniformly about one-half depth of neuropodium, 

 rather broad at base but tapering to a slender tip with scarcely dis- 

 cernible marginal denticulation. 



Color uniform dark brown, yellowish brown or pale yellow with a 

 few irregularly scattered dusky or black blotches, one of which may 

 be on the prostomium.

Proboscis of type 8.5 mm. long. 2.4 mm. in diameter at orifice; of 

 largest specimen 16 mm. long, 3 mm. in diameter at base and 4 mm. 

 at orifice. It is somewhat trumpet-shaped, gradually widening to the 

 somewhat flaring distal end which is surrounded by a circle of 18 to 20 

 low, rounded, soft papillae more or less incised at the base and in some 

 cases cleft in two. When protruded the proboscis has a slight spiral 

 twist and is marked by three narrow, raised longitudinal lines on each 

 side, the dorsal and ventral intervals between those of the two sides 

 being one-third more than the lateral intervals between those of the 

 same side. The general surface is marked with fine irregular wrinkles 

 and usually, but not always, with minute granulations which are 

 slightly more conspicuous along the raised lines.

 sand and pebbles, six specimens, two of which (including the type, a 

 female filled with large ova) are mature; 4,423, off San Nicolas Island, 

 April 13, 339 fathoms, gray sand, black pebbles, shells, one young 

 specimen, in which the longest (second dorsal) tentacular cirri each 

 bears a symmetrical swelling on its anterior face near the middle. 

 Eulalia nigrimaculata sp- nov. PI. XVI, fig-s. 24-26. 



Two complete specimens considerably contracted have the follow- 

 ing measurements: Type 33 mm. long; maximum width near middle 

 body only 1.5 mm., extreme width between tips of parapodia 3 mm.; 

 number of segments 89 ; female with eggs. Cotype 36 mm. long with 90 

 segments. 



Prostomium subglobose, slightly depressed, nearly circular in out- 

 line as seen from above; profile strongly convex, sloping downward 

 anteriorly; sharply differentiated from peristomium. Eyes one pair, 

 brown, with well-developed lenses, large, nearly one-fourth width of 

 prostomium, midway of the length and close to the lateral margins 

 of which they are situated. On the type the right eye is enormously 

 and abnormally enlarged and occupies the most of that side, to the dis- 

 placement of the dorsal right tentacle. Frontal tentacles widely sepa- 

 rated, the dorsal just outside of line of lateral border of eyes, the ventral 

 slightly nearer together; length of dorsal equal to prostomial width, with 

 swollen fusiform basal half and abruptly contracted filamentous distal 

 half ; ventral similar but with much shorter terminal filament. Median 

 tentacle (present in type only) arising between eyes, slightly longer than 

 frontal tentacles, with less swollen base and regularly tapered. 



Peristomium and II coalesced, forming a short distinct ring above, 

 crowded forward beneath the prostomium, at the sides of which the 

 peristomium appeal's. Mouth large, bounded by a nearly smooth 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 345 



posterior lip. Tentacular cirri much crowded, the peristomial and 



that of III (notocirrus) arising almost between the dorsal and ventral 

 cirri of II. the former at the higher level. All have short but distinct 

 eeratophores and prominent, regularly acuminate styles with slender 

 tips. They are slightly flattened in the type, much more strongly 

 flattened, apparently as a result of accidental pressure, in the cotype. 

 The longest (dorsal of II 1 reaches to XII. those of I and III reach to 

 IX and the ventral of II to VI. A conspicuous tuft of neuropodial 

 seta* occurs between the two cirri of II. 



Setigerous segments sharply defined by deep furrows : very short 

 anteriorly but increasing until in the middle region they are at least 

 one-third as long as wide. Slightly depressed and little more convex 

 above than below. Behind the middle they gradually diminish in 

 size to the pygidium, which is a very short and small ring, the cirri oi 

 which have been lost. 



Parapodia rather short, scarcely exceeding one-third width of their 

 -egments but with conspicuous spreading tufts of seta> which begin on 

 II. Neuropodia (PI. XVI. fig. 24) strongly compressed, subovate; 

 postsetal lip rudimentary: presetal lip well developed, foliaceous. 

 symmetrical, terminating in a blunt point but altogether lacking 

 notch. though there is a slight posterior groove in which the end of 

 the aciculum rests (,fig. 25). Xeurocirri (fig. 24) rather thick, very 

 large, especially anteriorly where they have an area of about four times 

 theneuropodium. but diminishing to twice the neuropodium posteriorly. 

 They are narrowly palette-shaped, the excavated portion attached to 

 low cirrophores on the ventral base of the neuropodia. the broad end 

 outward and bent dorsad behind and extending far beyond the neuro- 

 podia, which they completely conceal from behind and serve the pur- 

 pose of postsetal lobes. They are crowded with deep-brown or on the 

 margins often nearly black glands. NTotocirrophores (fig. 24) large 

 and prominent, erect, more or less dome-like with a restricted area for 

 attachment of the styles. Styles thin and membranous, easily 

 detached, somewhat imbricated and concealing the parapodia; anter- 

 iorly ovate with rounded ends, on middle segments broadly ovate- 

 euneate with pointed ends and posteriorly becoming elongated: the 

 base oblique and asymmetrical with a shallow sinus for attachment. 

 Internal structure finelv reticular with slightly developed veins and 

 glands. 



Aciculum single, colorless, tapered, ending in a rather acute point. 

 Seta 3 forming a very broad undivided, fan-shaped fascicle, very numer- 

 ous for the genus (30 on X. 4$ on XXV. 40 on I. and 36 on LXXV 




346 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



projecting about one-fourth of their length beyond the neurocirri. 

 Stems colorless, of moderate length, nearly straight, little enlarged at 

 the distal end (PI. XVI, fig, 26) where they terminate in a small shoulder 

 and a socket bounded on each side by a fringe of long delicate teeth. 

 Appendages very delicate, about as long as depth of neuropodium 

 with barely discernible marginal teeth. 



Proboscis (only partially protruded) cylindrical, 5.5 mm. long and 

 .6 mm. in diameter, surface thickly covered with small, blunt, flattened, 

 slightly retrorse papillae, separated by considerably more than their 

 length. 



Color gray-blue or bluish-plumbeous with a metallic blue iridescence 

 and brownish suffusions and marked with a few conspicuous gradrate 

 black spots, especially on the ventral surface, either widely scattered 

 singly or aggregated in groups. Notocirri uniform orange yellow. 

 Neurocirri yellowish with dark brown or blackish margin. 



Station 4,454, Monterey Bay, May 12, 71 fathoms, green mud and 

 sand. 



Eulalia levicornuta sp. now PL XVI, figs. 27-30. 



Only one small specimen measuring 43 mm. long is complete, with 

 221 segments. The type is much larger, being 70 mm. long for 172 

 segments and lacking perhaps the caudal one-third and 100 segments; 

 its maximum width of body at C -CXX is 1.2 mm., between tips of 

 parapodia 1.8 mm. Another very much macerated and incomplete 

 specimen referred here somewhat doubtfully has 240 segments and is 

 94 mm. long, and less than 1 mm. wide, having therefore nearly the 

 proportions of a slender lumbriconereid. 



Form very slender and elongated, nearly linear, but tapering gently 

 both ways from about the end of the anterior third. 



Prostomium (PL XVI, fig. 27) about as wide as long, moderately 

 depressed, semiovate with truncate ends or subtriangular with rounded 

 basal angles and truncated apex, usually sharply differentiated from 

 the peristomium, but in one specimen almost continuous with it dor- 

 sally. Eyes one pair, small, about one-seventh of posterior width of 

 prostomium, close to its postero-lateral angles, separated by three to 

 three and one-half times their diameter, dark brown, with small lenses. 

 Frontal tentacles situated on the sides of a distinctly separated anterior 

 segment of the prostomium, subcorneal, their length about one-half 

 prostomium. Median tentacle a minute, slender, conical papilla 

 situated on line between anterior border of eyes and having a length 

 of from one to one and one-half times their diameter. 



Peristomium a complete ring entirely posterior to the prostomium 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 347 



and usually free from it all round, scarcely wider than prostomium, 

 dorsally elevated into a convex platform-like area which in one case 

 overlaps the prostomium and partly covers the eyes. Mouth small 

 with nearly smooth posterior lip. Somites II and III similarly well 

 differentiated with similarly elevated dorsum. Tentacular cirri arising 

 from large cirrophores, the styles rather stout, tapered and short; the 

 peristomial pair about as long as prostomium and reaching to III; 

 ventral of II equal to peristomial and above its base a tubercle bearing 

 a small tuft of setae; dorsal of II about twice as long and reaching 

 VI or VII. Somite III bears a fully developed setigerous parapodium 

 and its tentacular notocirrus is equal to that of II. 



Anterior somites are uniannulate and very distinct, becoming less 

 well differentiated farther back as small interpodal annuli appear. 

 The raised dorsal field gradually merges with the general convexity of 

 the back. The venter is flat. They very gradually increase in size 

 to or beyond C, and taper thence caudad. 



Pygidium a dome-shaped ring about twice as long as the last 

 setigerous segment, bearing a pair of somewhat flattened, subcylin- 

 drical cirri resembling the posterior notocirri but rather larger than 

 they, together with a minute median cirrus (described from one speci- 

 men, station 4,431). 



Parapodia (PI. XVI, figs. 28, 29) small, little prominent and scarcely 

 exceeding one-fourth the width of their segments, but becoming 

 relatively longer and more prominent posteriorly. Setigerous neuro- 

 podia begin on II; they are slender, only slightly compressed, and 

 little tapered to a bluntly rounded presetal lip divided by a slight acicu- 

 lar notch into two equally rounded lobes, of which the subacicular is 

 usually somewhat longer; postsetal lip scarcely developed. 



Neurocirrophores broad and low, the styles (PI. XVII, figs. 28, 29) 

 subelliptical, little excavated for attachment, thick, more or less 

 foliaceous, broadest and relatively largest on anterior parapodia, where 

 they considerably exceed the neuropodia and extend somewhat beyond 

 them. Posteriorly they are relatively smaller and narrower, but often 

 so much longer that fully one-fourth of their length projects beyond 

 the neuropodia, but they always tend to diverge from the latter and 

 not to bend dorsad behind them. Notocirrophores (PI. XVI, figs. 

 28, 29) of anterior somites rather small, of middle somites low but 

 nearly as wide as the length of the neuropodia. Styles generally 

 foliaceous but comparatively small, carried nearly erect, little imbri- 

 cated and covering but a small part of the sides of the parapodia. 

 On anterior somites (fig. 28) they are regularly ovate with broadly 




348 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



rounded distal end and scarcely excavated base; on middle segments 

 larger, more broadly ovate, with bluntly pointed tips and nearly 

 straight symmetrical bases; while posteriorly they become again 

 smaller and tend toward a cuneate form. They all exhibit strongly 

 marked internal striations arranged in a partly bipinnate, partly 

 radiate pattern. On some specimens the styles are contracted and 

 much thicker, the anterior ones being nearly cylindrical, and all are 

 opaque and of a more or less deep brown color. Greatly extended speci- 

 mens have the notocirri all erect and widely separated. 



Aciculum single, rather slender, of the form usual in the genus, with 

 the bluntly pointed tip projecting slightly from the notch. Setae 

 (PI. XVI, fig. 30) arranged in the usual fan-shaped vertical fascicles 

 of one series, of a rather small number, as follows in the type: on X 

 7 supra- and 5 subacicular, on XXV 5 + 11, on L 9 + 11, on LXXY 11 

 + 12, on C 7 + 14 and on CLXX 14 in all. They have remarkably 

 long, slender shafts with slightly enlarged symmetrically cleft ends 

 forming the socket, each side of which is prolonged obliquely into a 

 prominent elongated tooth flanked on each side by a fringe of delicate 

 spinules. Appendages (fig. 30) rather short, usually one-third to one- 

 half depth of neuropodium, but on one specimen (station 4,431) rather 

 longer, broad at base and tapered and gently curved to a delicate 

 tip, the marginal denti dilations and oblique striations fine but distinct. 



Proboscis of a cotype protruded 2.5 mm., .4 mm. in diameter at distal 

 end, terete, gradually increasing in diameter distally, the entire surface 

 covered so thickly that they touch each other with crowded, granulated, 

 slightly flattened, rounded papillae, at least three irregular circles of 

 which at the distal end are of much larger size. 



Color of type (female filled with eggs) faded to a uniform pale greenish 

 drab or light olive. Another specimen is nearly uniform brown and 

 still another pale yellow with a thin brown line of granules across each 

 segment and the head, tentacular cirri and parapodial cirri deep 

 brown with aggregations of similar granules. 



One specimen from each of the following stations: 4,418, off Santa 

 Barbara Island, April 12, 238 fathoms, gray sand ; 4,420, off San Xicolas 

 Island, April 12, 291 fathoms, gray mud, rocks; 4,430 (type), off Santa 

 Cruz Island, April 14, 197 fathoms, black sand and pebbles; 4,433, off 

 Santa Rosa Island, April 15, 265 fathoms, gray mud. 



This species belongs to the bilineata-gracilis group and, with the 

 exception of the Hawaiian species E. navaica Kinberg, appears to be the 

 first of that group to be described from the Pacific. As is the case 

 with E. gracilis Verrill, specimens in different states of contraction differ 

 considerably in appearance. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 349 



Eulalia (Sige) bifoliata sp. nov. PI. XVI, figs. 31-34. 



Described from a single imperfect anterior end consisting of the 

 head and 57 segments, having a length of 18 mm. and a maximum 

 diameter between tips of parapodia of nearly 2 mm. Contracted and 

 rather stout, strongly arched above, flat below and little tapered in 

 the length of the piece. 



Prostomium (PL XVI, fig. 31) about three-fourths as long as wide, 

 somewhat depressed, subpyramidal with a straight, inclined profile, 

 greatest width in posterior half, posterior border nearly straight, 

 entire, bounded by a deep furrow separating the peristomium. No 

 anterior furrow behind tentacles. Eyes circular with prominent lenses, 

 brown, large, about one-fourth width of prostomium and situated at 

 its greatest width, about one-half their diameter anterior to posterior 

 border and close to lateral border. Frontal tentacles situated rather 

 close together at the truncated apex of prostomium, separated by 

 little more than one and one-half times their diameter, somewhat 

 macerated and imperfect, but their length approximately one-half 

 prostomium or slightly less. Median tentacle situated between 

 anterior border of e} r es at centre of prostomium, much smaller than 

 frontal tentacle, but macerated so that the exact size is not certain. 

 Immediately behind each eye is a faint brown spot. 



Peristomium scarcely visible above, forming a swollen lower lip 

 and small lobes beneath eyes. Remaining segments short, imiannulate. 

 Tentacular cirri with distinct cirrophores, all styles lost except the 

 ventral of II on one side, which is rather short and stout, conical, 

 about one and one-half times length of prostomium and reaching to 

 V. A small tuft of setae on II. 



Parapodia (PI. XVI, figs. 32, 33) small and little prominent, their 

 length about one-fourth width of somites on anterior and one-half 

 on posterior (middle) somites, but strongly compressed and deep. 

 Postsetal lip obsolete; presetal greatly developed and foliaceous, 

 divided by a deep acicular notch into a much smaller subacicular lobe, 

 rounded at the end, and a larger supra-acicular lobe prolonged into an 

 acuminate but blunt tip frequently much longer and more slender than 

 those figured. Neurocirrophores (figs. 32, 33) rounded swellings at 

 base of neuropodia; styles strongly foliaceous, thin, quadrant-shaped, 

 with the dorsal angle prolonged similarly to the supra-acicular lobe, 

 but usually extended far beyond the latter. Though of large size they 

 do not exceed the neuropodia of middle segments, the subsetal lobes 

 of which they completely cover from behind, reaching slightly dorsad 

 of the acicular notch, their nearly straight dorsal border being parallel 




350 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [J line, 



to the axis of the supra-acicular lobe and serving as a postsetal support 

 to the setse. Notocirrophores (fig. 33) low and flat, moderate in size, 

 immediately above notopodium. Three or four only of the notostyles 

 remain. They are strongly foliaceous but rather small, scarcely or 

 not longer than the neurostyles and about one and one-half times as 

 wide as they, broad ovate or suborbicular with nearly straight, truncate, 

 scarcely excavated base, opaque brown with granules chiefly arranged 

 in radial lines. 



Aciculum single, pale yellowish, with colorless base, straight, regu- 

 larly tapered to a simple point, which enters but does not project 

 beyond the acicular notch. Setse (PI. XVI, fig. 34) numerous (IS 

 supra- and 27 subacicular on XXV), forming a broad, spreading, fan- 

 shaped fascicle, the shafts colorless, long, with about one-third of their 

 length projecting beyond the margin of the neurocirrus, slightly 

 curved, little enlarged at the end, where they terminate in a prominent 

 shoulder and a pair of high, tapered processes finely denticulated at 

 the ends which bound the socket. The only perfect appendage seen 

 has a length of about three-fifths the depth of the neuropodium and 

 is slender and finely denticulated. 



Proboscis (dissected) tubular with smooth non-papillated lining; 

 orifice surrounded by a circle of apparently eighteen soft papillae. 



This species has the smooth proboscis, prolonged neuropodia and 

 neuropodial cirri and form of setae characteristic of the subgenus 

 Sige, features which appear in the descriptions of no known Eulalia 

 from the North Pacific or the west coast of South America.

NOTES ON THE BIRDS OF SAN DOMINGO, WITH A LIST OF THE SPECIES, 



INCLUDING A NEW HAWK. 



BY A. E. VERRILL AND A. HYATT VERRILL. 



During the winter and spring of 1906 and 1907, the junior author 

 visited San Domingo on a collecting trip, mainly for the mammals, 

 birds and reptiles, and especially for specimens of Solenodon parodoxus, 

 of which an account by him has been published in the Annals mid 

 Magazine of Natural History and elsewhere. 1 He had already ob- 

 tained a large and interesting collection when an attack of typhoid 

 fever unfortunately put an end to his work. 



The avifauna of San Domingo is remarkable for the number of species 

 peculiar to the island, many of which are confined to special, isolated 

 localities. Many species are met with only at certain seasons, while 

 others, usually very rare, are abundant in places where their food 

 plants occur, during the season when these plants are in fruit. 



The birds comprised in the accompanying list were obtained by the 

 junior author 2 in the Dominican Republic (Santo Domingo), between 

 December 21, 1906, and April 13, 1907. 



The list includes numerous species not hitherto recorded as taken 

 in San Domingo, two of which were undescribed forms. Many species 

 of migratory North American birds were obtained there for the first 

 time, so that the list gives valuable data as to the winter habitat of 

 many northern birds. A few species previously recorded from the 

 island were not observed, while several, such as the flamingo, spoonbill 

 and certain herons, were seen, but were not secured on account of their 

 shyness and the nearly inaccessible places which they frequent. 



The difficulties to be overcome in collecting in San Domingo are very 

 great; birds are comparatively scarce and many species are exceedingly 

 shy from constant hunting by the natives. It is quite probable, 

 therefore, that a number of species yet remain to be discovered in the 

 more remote and inaccessible swamps and mountains. 



Although practically the entire republic was covered by this trip,

localities were designated by districts as follows: Sanchez; Samana; 

 San Lorenzo; El Valle; La Vega; Miranda. Each of these districts 

 included the surrounding country for a radius of from twenty to 

 thirty miles. Sanchez, situated at the head of Samana Bay, proved 

 the most profitable collecting ground, for it affords a great variety 

 of country and vegetation. The town is built close to the shore of the 

 bay on a steep hillside. Directly back of the town a range of moun- 

 tains, which rises to a height of 3,500 feet, is covered with a dense 

 tropical forest, with the exception of the lower slopes, which are cleared 

 and partially under cultivation. West and south of the town are 

 extensive mangrove swamps, extending inland for twenty-five to thirty 

 miles and stretching across the bay to the mouth of the Barracota 

 River. Samana is also situated on the northern shore of Samana Bay, 

 about 16 miles east of Sanchez, and is surrounded by rolling hills, 

 forest-clad mountains, and broad and fertile valleys. The fauna was 

 much like that of the Sanchez district, but birds were by no means 

 so abundant. A few miles east of Samana, and half way across the 

 bay, is a large, wooded Key, known as the Cayo Levantado, and here 

 several rare species, as well as several migrants hitherto unrecorded 

 from San Domingo, were obtained. 



San Lorenzo is an abandoned banana estate on the southern shore 

 of Samana Bay, almost directly opposite Samana, and ten miles dis- 

 tant. It is situated on a small bay of its own (San Lorenzo Bay), 

 into which the Cana Honda River empties, and this bay and river are 

 fringed with extensive and deep mangrove swamps. The hills and 

 mountains back of San Lorenzo are of limestone formation, and are 

 remarkable for their isolated, conical forms and •numerous caves. 

 Between the hills are wide, partly swampy valleys, some of which are 

 covered with dense forests, while others are open and grassy. This 

 proved an excellent collecting ground, and many species occurred here 

 which were not seen elsewhere. El Valle is a small interior village, 

 some twenty-five miles inland from San Lorenzo. It is built on a wide 

 and beautiful prairie. These prairies or savannas are often swampy 

 and are covered with a luxuriant growth of coarse high grass, with 

 numerous clumps of trees and dense underbrush scattered over them. 

 In many places deep ravines, or arroyos, intersect the savannas, 

 and these are invariably filled with dense forest growth. The forests 

 in this vicinity are almost impenetrable on account of the sharp saw- 

 grass, which cuts the skin like a knife and even penetrates strong- 

 clothing and leather leggings. It is quite different from the saw-grass 

 of the southern United States, inasmuch as it climbs over the trees, 

 23 




354 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



often completely covering them to a height of twenty to thirty feet. 

 The El Valle district proved rich in species, and here were obtained a 

 number of unrecorded forms, as well as the two undescribed species. 



La Vega is a good-sized town, about seventy-five miles from Sanchez, 

 and is the inland terminal of a railway from the latter town. It is 

 built in the midst of the splendid Vega Real (Royal Valley), an immense 

 inland plain, surrounded by pine-covered mountains and with numer- 

 ous wooded ravines and river beds. Several rare species were taken 

 here, while in the pine forests of the mountains such species as the 

 trogan and white-winged dove were found. Miranda is a small village 

 nearly forty miles inland from La Vega, and situated in the heart of the 

 wild and unsettled mountains of the island. The birds were very 

 scarce in this locality, but several species not observed elsewhere 

 were obtained here. 



The climate of San Domingo is healthy and the usual tropical 

 fevers and malaria are almost unknown. Typhoid fever, however, 

 is at times prevalent in the interior. Although the annual rainfall is 

 great on many portions of the island, especially at Sanchez and 

 Samana, yet it was no greater than in the majority of the Antilles, and 

 during the months of February, March, and April the island suffered 

 from a prolonged drought. The temperature is variable, ranging 

 from 85° during the day to 48° at night. This extreme variation at 

 sea level is due largely to the easterly and northerly winds which pre- 

 vail during the night, while during the daytime they blow mainly 

 from the west and south. In this connection the following table may 

 be of interest:

10. Guara alba, White Ibis, "C6co." 



Abundant in all swamps and muclrhunted by the natives for food. 

 They are excellent eating. 



11. Plegadis autumnalis, Glossy Ibis. 



One specimen taken at Colorado River. 



12. Ardea caerulea caerulescens, West Indian Little Blue Heron, "Garza." 



Very abundant in all swamps, along the rivers and in damp meadows

 front of the town, where they act as scavengers and are exceedingly 

 tame and unsuspicious. 




356 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



13. Butoroides virescens maculata, West Indian Green Heron, "Cangrito," "Martin- 



Pescador." 



Very abundant and tame. Found wherever there was a pond, 

 brook or even a roadside mud puddle. 



14. Aramus giganteus, Lirnpkin, " Carrara." 



Common in savannas throughout the country, but seldom seen, 

 although frequently heard. 



15. Ionornis martinica, Purple Gallinule. 



Not rare at San Lorenzo and in the vicinity of Sanchez. 



16. Gallinula galeata, Florida Gallinule. 



Common in the mangrove swamps and damp savannas. 



17. Fulioa americana. American Coot. 



Not rare in the swamps and rivers. 



18. Actitis macularia, Spotted Sandpiper. 



Exceedingly common everywhere. 



19. Ereunetes pusillus, Least Sandpiper. 



Rare; one specimen taken at Sanchez. 



20. Gallinago delioata, Wilson's Snipe. 



Abundant at San Lorenzo and at El Valle, where in the broad wet 

 savannas I found the best snipe shooting I have ever seen. The 

 natives had never seen the bird except in flight, as they are unable to 

 shoot them on the wing. 



21. lEgialitis vooifera, Killdeer. 



Common at El Valle; Sanchez; Samana and La Vega. 



22. JEgialitis semipalmata, Semipalinated Plover. 

 Common at Samana. 



23. JEgialitis wilsoni, Wilson's Plover. 



Common at Samana. 



24. Arenaria interpres, Turnstone. 



Common on the small sandy cays in Samana Bay. 



25. (Edicnemus dominioensis, "Boukaru." 



Formerly common on all the interior savannas, but now rare. This 

 strange bird is often kept domesticated for the purpose of ridding the 

 native huts of roaches and other vermin. The eggs are dark chocolate- 

 brown, marbled with blackish. It breeds readily in captivity. The 

 natives have a peculiar method of capturing this bird alive at night. 

 They stand naked in the long grass of the prairies frequented by the 

 birds and wave fire-flies about their heads with one hand. The birds 

 approach to capture the flies and are readily captured with the free 

 hand. 




1909. J NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 357 



26. Nycticorax violaceus, Yellow-crowned Night Heron. "Rey Congo." 



Very common in the swamps and along the larger rivers. 



27. Numida meleagris, Guinea Fowl. 



Introduced and now common in the interior of the country. Affords 

 excellent shooting. 



28. Columba leucocephala, White-headed Pigeon, " Paloma." 



The commonest of the pigeons throughout the country. These fine 

 birds are extensively hunted and sell for from 10 cents to 25 cents 

 per pair. At certain seasons — May to September — these pigeons 

 appear in huge flocks. At other times they are shy and suspicious, 

 and are seen only singly or in pairs. They feed extensively on the 

 fruit of the mangroves. 



29. Columba corensis, Squamated Pigeon, " Paloma Torcaz." 



Fairly common in the mangrove swamps and dense forests of the 

 interior. 



30. Columba inomata, West Indian Pigeon. 



Rarer than the preceding species and found in the same localities. 



31. Zenaidura macroura, Mourning Dove. 



Rare; a single specimen was obtained near La Vega. 



32. Zenaida zenaida, Zenaida Dove, "Tortola." 



Abundant along the river banks of the interior where they feed on 

 the seeds of a yellow-flowered, poppy-like plant. 



33. Melopelia leucoptera, White-winged Dove, "R0II611." 



Rare ; confined to the pine forests of the mountains of the interior. 



34. Geotrygon martinica, Key West Quail-dove, "Perdiz." 



Only one specimen, obtained on Cayo Levantado, in Samana Bay. 



35. Geotrygon montana, Ruddy Quail-dove, " Perdiz Colorado." 



Abundant in damp, dark, open woodland throughout the republic. 

 Particularly fond of the impenetrable saw-grass thickets, into which 

 it runs at the first sign of danger. Large numbers are trapped by the 

 natives for food. They were sold in the markets of El Valle for three 

 cents a pair. 



36. Accipiter fringilloides, "SanNicolo," "Harpon." 



Rare ; found in all parts of the island, but obtained only at Miranda. 



37. Eupornis ridgwayi, Ridgway's Buzzard, " Guaraguajo." 



Rare; taken only at Miranda, but seen flying over in other localities. 



38. Buteo tropicalis, sp. nov., Tropical Buzzard. 



This fine new hawk, of which two specimens were obtained, is con- 

 fined to the southern side of Samana Bay. They are a sluggish, 




358 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



heavily flying bird and will sit motionless for hours on the dead trees of 

 cleared land waiting for rats and lizards. Their note resembles that of 

 Buteo latissimus. The nest is built on dead trees, preferably Ceibas, 

 at a great height from the ground. 



Description. — Male, type, San Lorenzo, January 12, 1907. Above, 

 sooty-brownish with a rich, metallic, purplish gloss. Scapulars and 

 tertials, as well as upper wing-coverts, narrowly edged and tipped 

 with ashy-gray. Neck and shoulders streaked, and each feather edged, 

 with rich ferruginous. Upper tail-coverts rusty-white, barred with 

 sienna-brown. Tail rusty-ferruginous, the feathers white at base 

 and tips, and with a subterminal bar of dusky-black, broadest on the 

 outer feathers. About seven to nine distinct, dusky bands on upper 

 surface of tail. Under surface of tail pale, rusty-white without bars. 

 Forehead, lores, orbital region and a patch on crown, pure white; 

 the last partially concealed by dusky tips to the feathers. A distinct 

 "mustache" and a narrow superciliary stripe of black. Primaries 

 and secondaries rich brown, broadly tipped with and crossed by five 

 bars of black. Outer webs of first five primaries, and about one-half 

 of the inner webs of same, dusk}' with purplish reflections. 



Below white, tinged with buffy on chest, crissum and thighs; the 

 chin and throat narrowly streaked with dusky. Chest thickly streaked 

 with ferruginous, thickest on sides and almost confluent, forming 

 there a more or less distinct ferruginous patch. Feathers of belly 

 broadly tipped with dusky, with a "dumbbell-shaped" spot near the 

 base of each feather, forming a distinct, dusky zone across the abdomen. 

 Flanks dusky brown, each feather spotted with white. Thighs barred 

 with ferruginous. Lower tail coverts buff. Under wing coverts 

 buffy-white streaked with sienna-brown, and with a large triangular 

 dark-brown patch near carpal joint. Eyes, pale yellow; feet and 

 legs, yellow; cere, pale green; bill, bluish. 



Immature birds much resemble the adults, but lack the rich purple 

 gloss of upper parts, and the tail is brownish-gray, crossed by about 

 ten distinct, dusky bands. 



Length, 19 to 21 inches. Wing, 14 to 14.50. Tail, 7.50 to 8. 



39. Faloo dominicensis, Dominican Sparrow-hawk. 



Not uncommon in the interior and on the northern coast. 



40. Falco sparverius, Cuban Sparrow-hawk. 



Rare. Taken only at Miranda. 



41. Falco columbarius, Pigeon Hawk. 



Not common. Obtained at Miranda. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 359 



42. Pandion haliaetus, Osprey. 

 Abundant around the mangrove swamps, but very shy. 



43 Strix glaucops, San Domingo Barn-owl. "Lechusa." 



Common, but seldom seen during the day. 



44. Speotyto dominicensis, San Domingo Burrowing-owl, " Tucii." 



Common on the dry prairies between La Vega and Santiago, as well 

 as in the vicinity of Azua on the southwestern coast. 



45. Conurus chloropterus, Parroquet, " Periqiiito." 



Rare and confined to certain localities, as El Valle and Matanzas. 

 They feed on the fruit of the royal palm and are hunted by the natives 

 for food. 



46. Amazona sallaei, Salle's Parrot. " Cotorro." 



Common throughout the island, but particularly abundant during 

 the months of January and February when the seeds of the "Guama" 

 trees are ripe. Large numbers are killed for food and many are taken 

 from the nests and tamed. They are very gentle in captivity and are 

 splendid talkers. 



47. Crotophaga ani, Ani, "Judio." 



Abundant everywhere. The native name — "Judio" or Jew — 

 refers to the heavy, roman-nosed beak. 



48. Coccyzus minor, Mangrove Cuckoo, "Moutero." 



Abundant in some localities and entirely absent in others near by. 

 This bird was particularly common at San Lorenzo and^El Valle, but 

 was never seen at Sanchez, sixteen miles distant, although it was quite 

 common, at La Vega and throughout the interior. 



49. Coccyzus maynardi, Maynard's Cuckoo. 



Rare. One specimen obtained at San Lorenzo. 



50. Saurothera dominicensis, San Domingo Cuckoo, "Bobo." 



Abundant in all portions of the republic. They are very tame 

 and stupid, as implied by the native name of "Bobo," meaningfa fool. 

 This bird is eaten by the natives as a cure for stomach troubles. 



51. Hyetornis fieldii. 



Met with only between Miranda and La Vega. 



52. Temnotrogan roseigaster, San Domingo Trogan, "Papagayo." 



Common in the pine forests about La Vega and Miranda, but very 

 shy and difficult to obtain. They perch motionless in the pine trees, 

 and their colors blend perfectly with that of the pine needles and red- 

 dish bark. 



53. Ceryle aloyon, Belted Kingfisher. 



Common near water everywhere. Breeds. 




360 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



54. Todus subulatus, Tody, " Barrancali." 



Abundant at all localities visited. Very tame and unsuspicious. 

 On one occasion one of these birds actually alighted on my gun-barrel, 

 as I stood motionless near a small stream. The note of this bird is a 

 frog-like croak. The nest is built in holes in the banks of streams; 

 eggs pure white. 



55. Todus angustirostris, Narrow-billed Tody, " Barrancali chico." 



The habits and note of this species are similar to the preceding, 

 but it is not so common and is very local in its distribution. I found 

 it more common than subulatus at San Lorenzo and El Valle, but did 

 not meet with it at all at Sanchez, and saw but one or two individuals 

 at Samana. In the interior it was about as abundant as subulatus. 



56. Pioumnus lawrenoei, Lawrence's Pigmy Woodpecker. 



This odd little bird is rather rare, although possibly its apparent 

 scarcity is due to its quiet and retiring habits and dull coloring 

 which render it inconspicuous. It was not known to any natives 

 I met, and was obtained only at Sanchez and Samana. 



57. Melanerpes striatus, Woodpecker, "Carpintero." 



This is the most abundant and destructive bird on the island. It 

 is seen everywhere and there is hardly a palm tree in the republic that 

 is not riddled with its holes. It feeds on fruits, oranges, and cacao- 

 pods and frequently ruins the crop. 



Fortunately its increase is kept down by a fatal provision of nature 

 in the shape of a parasitic worm which infests the throat and head. 

 This worm matures at the season when the young woodpeckers are 

 able to leave the nest, and after that time it is practically impossible 

 to find an adult Melanerpes alive. The ground beneath the nests is 

 often strewn with dead and dying adult birds, their throats and 

 crops so distended with the disgusting parasites as to render them 

 incapable of flight. 



58. Chordeiles minor, Cuban Nighthawk. 



Common on the open savannas of the interior. 



59. Antrostomus oarolinensis, Chuck-Wills- Widow, " Quiere Beber." 



Not rare in the more open portions of wooded hillsides and on open 

 savannas. Sanchez; La Vega; El Valle. 



60. Cypseloides niger, Black Swift, "Golondrina negro." 



Common in the interior and at Samana. 



61. Cypselus phoenicobius, Swift. 



Common along the Camu River at La Vega. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 361 



62. Chaetura zonaris, Collared Swift. 



This large swift is common at La Vega and in the interior, but 

 usually flies at such an elevation that it is very difficult to shoot. 



63. Lampornis dominious, " Zumbador." 



This humming-bird is common throughout the island. 

 64- Mellisuga minima, " Zumbadorito." 



This tiny atom of bird life is very common at all points visited. It 

 is remarkable for its loud and penetrating song, which it gives forth 

 hour after hour, as it perches on some slender twig or on the topmost 

 leaf of some palm tree. 



65. Sporadinus elegans. 



I found this handsome humming-bird at all points visited, but most 

 abundant at El Valle. It loves dark woods and swamps and dashes 

 suddenly into sight, only to flash off almost before the gun can be 

 raised to shoulder. 



66. Tyrannus dominicensis, Gray Kingbird, "PeTigre." 



Very common everywhere. 



67. Pitangus gabbii, Gabb's Petarchy. 



Rare; found only at Miranda. 



68. Myiarchus dominicensis, Dominican Crested Flycatcher, "Manuelito." 

 Common in most localities. 



60. Blacicus hispaniolensis, Hispaniola Flycatcher. 



Common in most places. 



70. Lawrencia nanus. 



Extremely rare; found at Miranda only. 



71. Elaina cherriei. 



One specimen taken at Miranda. 



72. Corvus leucognaphalus, Crow, "Cuervo." 



Abundant in the mangrove swamps, but so frequently hunted for 

 food that they are shy and suspicious. At San Lorenzo immense 

 flocks of this crow flew back and forth from their roosts in the mountains 

 to their feeding grounds in the swamps, at morning and evening, but 

 always at a great elevation. 



Their note resembles the words "Quiero casa carrajo," and the 

 natives firmly believe that they can understand and converse in 

 Spanish. Their calls certainly more nearly resemble human speech 

 than anything else. 



73. Corvus solitarius, Solitary Crow, " Cao." 



Rarer than the preceding and confined to the interior. The habits 

 and notes are much the same as of the last. 




362 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



74. Icterus dominicensis, San Domingo Oriole, " Sigua calandre." 



This bird, which is a charming songster, is common at all points 

 visited. It is found in small flocks, the young males, females and 

 males keeping in separate flocks. 



75. Quiscalus niger, Black Grackle, "Chinchiling." 



Abundant at all points visited, although mainly found in the vicinity 

 of houses and settlements. It is a noisy creature, continually uttering 

 its loud, liquid cry of " Chiniling-ling-eeee. " 



76. Quiscalus sp?. 



Among the Quiscali obtained were a number which to me appear 

 distinct from niger, as they are much larger and heavier, with relatively 

 stouter bill and feet. The note is quite distinct from that of niger, 

 and the natives state that they are different. Dr. Hartert, of Tring, 

 thinks, however, that the difference is merely sexual. 



77. Loximitris dominicensis, Dominican Grosbeak. 



I found this pretty species abundant in certain localities near La 

 Vega. They were always found in large flocks in open pasture land, 

 and in habits, flight and notes much resembled the American Gold- 

 finch. They fed on wild guava fruit. They are shy, restless birds and 

 are usually found in flocks of a dozen to twenty individuals. Some- 

 times .they will remain until the intruder approaches within a few 

 yards, while at other times they take flight long before one can approach 

 within gunshot. They are fond of perching on dead or partly dead 

 bushes and trees in open prairie or pasture land, near rivers or on the 

 edges of thickets, and invariably fly into the latter or across the 

 former when disturbed. 



78. Loxigilla violacea, Violet Loxigilla, " Prieto" (male), " Chichigua " (female). 



Abundant in all parts of the island. 



79. Tiaris bicolor, Grassquit, "Juana Mariica." 



Common in most places. In a few localities entirely replaced by T. 

 lepida, as examples at El Valle and in some spots near La Vega. 



80. Tiaris lepida, Yellow-faced Grassquit. 



Abundant at La Vega, El Valle and other localities, but entirely 

 absent from the vicinity of Sanchez and Samana. 



81. Ammodramus savannarum intricatus. 



This new species, described by Dr. Ernst Hartert from specimens 

 obtained by me at El Valle, is very common on the broad grassy 

 savannas of that region. They are difficult to shoot as they flit up 

 from the dense grass, to disappear in it again almost instantly. The 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 363 



note is short, weak and insect-like, and greatly resembles that of our 

 own Grasshopper Sparrow. 



82. Euphonia musica, Musical Euphonia. 



All the specimens of this rare species which I obtained were killed 

 from a single tree near Sanchez. It was never seen or heard elsewhere. 

 The first specimen was taken on February 26. It was feeding on a 

 parasitic vine with greenish-white berries, resembling mistletoe. A 

 few moments later several additional birds arrived and commenced 

 feeding, although none had ever been seen there before, and the tree 

 was one from which I secured birds daily. For several days thereafter 

 the Euphonias could always be found on this tree, although none were 

 ever seen elsewhere. They are quiet, slow moving birds and crawl 

 about in the deliberate, parrot-like manner of others of the genus. 

 The song is very clear, liquid and musical, closely resembling that of 

 the White-throated Sparrow. 



83. Spindalis multicolor, Painted Tanager. 



This rare and beautiful bird is a good example of the class of birds 

 common at one season and very rare at others. Not a single bird of 

 this species was seen previous to January 22, 1907, on which date I 

 obtained a single female at Sanchez. No others were seen until Feb- 

 ruary 26, and then, in a single week, over sixty specimens were secured 

 within a radius of one hundred yards. After the last date no others 

 could be found. 



All these specimens were feeding on the reddish-purple berries of a 

 parasitic plant. They are very curious birds in their habits, and 

 quite different from any other species with which I am familiar. They 

 arrive and depart from their feeding grounds so suddenly and silently 

 that one must watch constantly in order to see them. While feeding 

 they are also silent and stand almost motionless in one spot until 

 all the berries within reach are consumed, when they dart suddenty 

 to another spot and repeat the operation. The males are fond of perch- 

 ing in dense thickets or among clumps of thickly growing air-plants, 

 singing their feeble, insect-like song. They are very shy and at the 

 least movement or noise cease their notes and remain motionless, and 

 if discovered at once dash into the thickest growth, where it is impossi- 

 ble to follow them. 



84. Phcenicophilus dominicanus. 

 Rare; only found at Miranda. 



85. Phcenicophilus palmarum, "Cuartoojos." 



This beautiful tanager was abundant everywhere. Its habits 

 resemble those of a vireo more than those of a tanager. 




364 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



86. Calyptophilus frugivorus. 



Rare at most places visited. La Vega and Miranda only. 



87. Progne dominicensis, San Domingo Martin. 

 Common near the coasts. 



88. Petrochelidon fulva, Cuban Cliff-swallow, " Golondrina." 



Common at most localities visited. 



89. Hirundo sclateri, Sclater's Swallow, " Golondrina verde." 



This most beautiful species was met with only at La Vega, where 

 it was abundant along the Camu River. 



90. Dulus dominicus, "Sigua palmyra. " 



This odd bird is excessively abundant throughout the island. It 

 is gregarious and breeds in colonies in huge nests, which are usually 

 placed in the royal palms. They are noisy, restless creatures, and 

 the cries from a nest of these birds during the breeding season can 

 be heard for half a mile. I was unable to determine whether each 

 female had a compartment in the huge nests, or if they deposited their 

 eggs and sat upon them at random. I am inclined to think the latter 

 is the case, however, as the eggs are scattered through the nest, with 

 no apparent attempt at order, and I do not believe that even the 

 parent birds could identify the young, that scramble back and forth 

 throughout the nest. 



The old nests are torn down bodily by the birds and often huge 

 piles of old nesting materials are scattered on the ground beneath the 

 palms where they breed. When they wish to destroy a nest, several 

 hundred birds will seize hold of the structure and by pulling and tug- 

 ging will succeed in tearing it from its support. They are curious, 

 inquisitive creatures and always gather about and protest vigorously 

 at the report of a gun. 



91. Vireo calidris, West Indian Vireo, "Qiiienfue"; "JuanChivi." 



Common everywhere. The two local names refer to the note. 

 The first, meaning "Who Goes There," is very appropriate, as the bird 

 always becomes restless at one's approach, and repeats the short, perti- 

 nent query over and over, at times being answered by another vireo 

 in notes that resemble the words "Juan Chivi." 



92. Coereba bananivora, Banana Creeper, " Sigua.'' 



Common in most places. 



93. Mniotilta varia, Black and White Warbler. 

 Abundant migrant. 



91. Parula americana, Parula Warbler. 

 Very common during migrations. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 365 



95. Dendroica tigrina, Cape May Warbier. 



Abundant. Among the large series of specimens of this species 

 which I obtained, there appear to be two forms; one, the common 

 North American bird; the other, more richly colored, with distinctly 

 chestnut breast, deep-yellow wing-bars, and rich — almost orange — 

 yellow breast and belly. As young birds in nestling plumage, as well 

 as females containing eggs ready for the nest, were obtained, I consider 

 it possible to separate the resident bird from the northern form as a 

 local variety or subspecies. 



96. Dendroioa ccerulescens, Black-throated Blue Warbler. 



An abundant migrant. 



97. Dendroica coronata, Myrtle Warbler. 

 Very common during migrations. 



98. D. maculosa, Magnolia Warbler. 



A rare migrant, one specimen taken at Samana. 



99. D. dominioa, Yellow-throated Warbler. 

 A common species. 



100. D. vigorsii, Pine Warbler. 



Common in pine forests of the interior where it breeds. 



101. D. palmarum, Palm Warbler.

102. D. discolor, Prairie Warbler. 



A common migrant. 



103. Seiurus aurocapillus, Oven Bird.

Common, but seen only near fresh water. 



106. Geothlypis trichas, Maryland Yellowthroat. 



Common. 



107. Microlegia palustris. 



Said to be common in various parts of the country, but only met with 

 once, at El Valle.

 whistle. 



111. Turdus alioiae, Alice's Thrush. 



A rare migrant. One specimen taken near Sanchez.

A NEW SPECIES OF SCALPELLUM FROM BRITISH COLUMBIA. 



BY HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



Soalpellum (Arcoscalpellum) columbianum n. sp. Figs. 1, 2. 



The capitulum is much compressed, more than twice as long as wide, 

 white under a very thin smooth pale yellowish cuticle ; occludent border 

 straight, carinal border evenly arched; greatest width about median. 

 There is no sculpture aside from indistinct growth-lines. 



The scutum has parallel occludent and internal margins, and is rather 

 narrow, with apical uril'o. 



The tergum is long, triangular, its occludent margin short, arched, 

 apex slightly recurved; the scutal and carinal margins are very long 

 and nearly straight. 



The carina is very long, with well-developed parietes of nearly equal 

 width; dorsal face very narrow throughout, and deeply guttered, the 

 high bordering ribs about as wide as the intervening groove or gutter. 

 It is more curved near the apex, which is situated high, about at the 

 upper sixth of the carinal side of the tergum. At its base the carina 

 intrudes between the umbones of the carinal latera. 



The upper latus is roughly trapezoidal, the scutal and carinal 

 borders parallel, upper border oblique, basal border convex. 



The rostrum is minute, oblong, slightly contracted in the middle. 



The rostral latus is rather low, triangular, the upper and lower 

 margins converging toward the rostral apex. 



The inframedian latus is narrowly subtriangular, spreading above, 

 narrowed towards the base. The umbo is near or at the lower third. 



The carinal latus is subtriangular, the umbo projecting at the base 

 of the carina, far below the bases of the other plates. The carinal 

 border is straight above, becoming concave near the base. 



The peduncle is short, covered with scales, of which there are about 

 16 rows of about 10 scales each. They are not regularly arranged. 



Length of capitulum 8.5, width 3.4, diameter 1.3 mm.; length of 

 carina 7.25 mm.; length of peduncle 3 mm. (fig. 1). 



Length of capitulum 7.7, width 3.3 mm.; length of carina 6.8 mm., 

 of peduncle 4 mm. (fig. 2).

This species is known by three specimens of about equal size, which 

 were preserved dry; hence no examination of the internal organs 

 has been attempted. It is related to Scalpellum soror Pils. 1 from deep 

 water (634 fathoms), near the Galapagos Islands, but differs from that

NOTE ON THE MORPHOLOGY OF FULGUR. 



BY BURNETT SMITH. 



On the whole the marine gastropods are singularly free from indi- 

 vidual abnormalities or deformations, and this rule holds good for 

 the two large conchs (Fulgur carica Gmelin and F. canaliculatum 

 Say) which are washed upon our Atlantic Coast in such large numbers 

 during the winter storms. As far as the writer knows there is no record 

 of an abnormal individual of F. carica. F. canaliculatum, on the 

 other hand, has furnished a small number of deformed specimens 

 which have found their way into museums. Some of these have been 

 described and figured. 



Deformations of the Shell in F. canaliculatum. — In the museum of 

 the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia there are two ab- 

 normal shells of this species. In the first of these the branchial 

 siphon has grown in such a way that its direction is almost at right 

 angles to the axis of coiling of the spire. From an examination of 

 the exterior of the shell it is impossible to state with certainty the 

 causes of this condition. Whether it is the result of accident or of 

 some truly pathologic condition cannot be determined. 1 The second 

 specimen, collected at Longport, New Jersey, was figured and de- 

 scribed by the present writer. 2 In this case the deformation can 

 be traced to a break in the shell which occurred at a relatively early 

 stage in the ontogeny. The result of this has been a complete change 

 in the whorl form and sculpture, the tubercles and shoulder keel 

 disappear and we have a smooth, rounded whorl very similar to that 

 of F. pyrum Dilw. In this connection- it is interesting to note that 

 paleontological data points to the descent of F. pyrum either from 

 F. canaliculatum or from some very closely allied form, and further- 

 more that this descent was marked by the almost complete disappear-

ance (through acceleration) of the shoulder keel and the assumption 

 of a smooth, rounded whorl outline. In other words we have here a 

 striking parallel of an evolutional process which has taken place 

 slowly during geological time and resulted in the change of one species 

 into another, with a change which has been caused by accident in the 

 growth of an individual. 



In this Longport specimen the animal when washed ashore fortu- 

 nately possessed the soft parts intact. A carefull examination of 

 these disclosed no unusual condition other than the fact that the 

 mantle was rounded instead of angulated. The mantle edge was in 

 noway peculiar and the penis, which in the normal male underlies the 

 shoulder angle, was fully developed and exactly similar to that found 

 in other individuals. In fact no peculiarity of the soft parts could 

 be detected which would account for the causes of the change in shell 

 growth. 



'Abnormality in the Soft Parts of F. canaliculatum. — In the specimen 

 just described the absence of a shoulder angle in the mantle and in 



the shell does not seem to 



be connected in any way 



with the underlying repro- 

 ductive organ. Fig. 1 shows 



the character of the normal, 



backward folded penis which 



lies immediately below the 



shoulder angle. Inasmuch, 



then, as we have noted an 



individual with abnormal shell 



reproductive organs, it is of 



attention to another specimen collected by 



the writer which has an entirely normal shell 



but whose reproductive organs are imperfect 

 (fig. 2). In this case the penis is small, not being more than one- 

 fifth the usual length. If this condition had been the result of an 

 injury to the penis we might expect to find traces of its original con- 

 dition at least around its base. This, however, is not shown for the 

 base is small, having about one-half the normal width. We are there- 

 fore justified, it is believed, in regarding this as an instance of arrested 

 development in a particular organ. No other abnormalities in the 

 soft parts were observed and, as stated before, the shell is in every 

 regard similar to that of the normal individual.

tive morphology of F. canaliculatum and F. carica are furnished 



by a study of the male reproductive organ. 



In the former species the penis is turned 



backward and folded (fig. 1). It likewise 



retains the same width at the distal end as 



at the proximal, while in addition the terminal 



process is relatively large. In F. carica, on 



the other hand, the organ tapers gradually 



from the proximal to the distal end and the 



terminal process is very small (fig. 3). The 



penis though turned backward is not folded 



at the turn as in F. canaliculatum. Gmelin. Diagram

the features of the gastropod shell, its form, 



size and ornamentation, are the result of changes in the lime-secreting 

 soft parts. A shoulder keel, for instance, is caused by a permanent 

 angle, while a spine represents the effect of a temporary elevation 

 of the mantle. What is it though which produces this temporary 

 bulging of the mantle edge? What is the physiological meaning of 

 the spine? This is a question which has never yet been satisfactorily 

 answered in spite of many ingenious suggestions. One view, often 

 expressed, holds that the spines represent an activity of the mantle 

 edge which is manifested at recurrent reproductive periods. This 

 may indeed be true, but it is yet to be proved. 



To apply the discussion to the forms considered in this paper we 

 may ask: Have the spines in Fulgur carica any connection with 

 either copulation or oviposition? Though this question could prob- 

 ably be solved at one of our marine laboratories, its solution has 

 apparently never been attempted. In the absence, then, of definite 

 information on the subject, it is believed that it is pertinent to outline 

 here certain objections which might be raised against the above 

 theory. 



(1) If the spines are caused by oviposition there is a difficulty in 

 explaining their equal development in both the male and the female. 



(2) If the spines are caused by the act of copulation there is likewise 

 a difficulty in explaining their exact similarity in the two sexes. 



To extend our inquiry to Fulgur canaliculatum, it is first to be noted 

 that this species has no true spines. In this form the spines have 

 disappeared, their former presence being shown by the small tubercles 

 which have been crowded back by acceleration into the early whorls. 




372 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



It is difficult therefore to believe that spine production in Fulgur is 

 the result of reproductive activity when we regard these two Atlantic 

 Coast species, with equally well developed reproductive organs and 

 with presumably similar habits of oviposition, the one spineless and 

 the other spined. By an examination of the penis in the two species we 

 can select no character in one which should produce a spine, or in the 

 other case state why the protrusion of the penis should not produce 

 a spine. 



Considering now the shoulder keel, which seems to be the evolu- 

 tional successor of the row of spines, we know by actual observation 

 that the non-development of the penis in F. canaliculatum does not 

 necessarily affect the keel, while, on the other hand, an injured keel- 

 less individual may possess the organ in its normal condition. 



From these facts we can be reasonably confident that the shoulder 

 keel has no connection with reproductive activity. When it comes to 

 the spines, however, we can but say that there are no characters in 

 the penis of F. canaliculatum which we can definitely correlate with 

 the spineless condition of the shell, and in F. carica we can assign to 

 the different form of the organ no cause for the development of spines.

THE VEGETATION OF THE SALT MARSHES AND OF THE SALT AND FRESH 

 WATER PONDS OF NORTHERN COASTAL NEW JERSEY. 



BY JOHN W. HARSHBERGER. 



In a number of papers 1 of greater or less length, I have discussed 

 the character of the vegetation of the New Jersey coast. The obser- 

 vations recorded in these various brochures cover territorially the 

 immediate coast from Bay Head in the north to Cape May in the 

 south, and were based on field work and on the study of collections 

 made for the several large herbaria in Philadelphia. During a resi- 

 dence at Belmar, New Jersey, from August 12 to September 15, 1908, 

 and July 7 to September 8, 1909, an opportunity was afforded of making 

 collections, and of completing a survey of the vegetation of the New 

 Jersey coast, begun in 1893, by a study of the coast from Manasquan 

 Inlet north to Sandy Hook and along Sandy Hook Bay several miles 

 westward from Highland Beach. 



On several railroad trips from Belmar to New York City, I was able, 

 by a familiarity with the coastal flora for over a period of fifteen years, 

 to extend my observations, while on the moving trains, as far north 

 as the Hudson River, notably at Red Bank on the Navesink River, at 

 Matawan on Matawan Creek, along Newark Bay — in fact, such obser- 

 vations were made wherever undisturbed salt marshes were crossed 

 by the Central Railroad of New Jersey and the Pennsylvania Railroad 

 between Belmar and Jersey City. So that, although the description 

 given in this paper is confined to the coast between Manasquan Inlet 

 and Sandy Hook Bay, where collections and a field study were made, 

 yet it can be said that, from the car-window observations, 2 essentially

2 This has been the favorite method of Dr. Roland M. Harper in his study 

 of the coastal flora of the Southern States. It is fairly satisfactory as extending 

 the range of certain types of vegetation, but is unscientific unless checked by 

 actual collections and study of a section of the plant formations investigated, as 

 put into practice above. 




374 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [Aug., 



the same type of salt marsh vegetation exists as far north as New York 

 City. 



Early in the field work it became apparent that my entire time and 

 attention could be devoted to the salt marsh and pond vegetation of 

 the region covered by this phytogeographic survey, for a study of the 

 flora of the sea beaches and sand dunes, which are not extensive on the 

 northern New Jersey coast, revealed the fact that the same association 

 of shore and dune plants existed north of Manasquan Inlet as south of 

 it as far as Cape May. The vegetation of the salt marshes, salt ponds 

 and fresh water ponds of the northern New Jersey coast present so 

 many features of interest that it was fortunate that my undivided 

 attention could be given to its study, so that the dune flora will be 

 mentioned in what follows only when necessary in elucidating the 

 composition of juxtaposed plant formations. 



Physiography of the Region. 



No mention is made of the ponds which are characteristic of the 

 northern shore of New Jersey in the works that have been published 

 on the physiography of New Jersey. Several of them at Ocean Grove 

 and Asbury Park have been surrounded by embankments, and are 

 used for pleasure craft and for winter and summer carnivals. Begin- 

 ning at Manasquan Inlet in the south and traveling northward, one 

 encounters the following bodies of water, which will be designated as 

 open or closed to the ocean, and therefore fresh or salt : 3 



Manasquan Inlet (open and salt). 



Newberry Lake = Stockton Lake (open and salt, connected with 

 Manasquan River). 



Wreck Pond (open and salt in 1908; closed during the summer of 

 1909 and fresh until August 13, 1909, when it was opened to let in 

 the salt water). 



Spring Lake (closed and fresh). 



Como Lake (closed and fresh). 



Silver Lake (closed and fresh; pleasure lake). 



Shark River Inlet (open, with strong tidal movement to and from 

 the sea; closed on July 23, 1909, by the formation of a sand bar during 

 a southeast storm; opened again August 12, 1909). 



Sylvan Lake = Duck Pond (closed and fresh, but connected with 

 sea at very high tides). 



3 The following maps, published under the auspices of the Geological Survey 

 of New Jersey, will be found useful: Atlas Sheet No. 9, Monmouth Shore, 1902; 

 Navesink Sheet, 1901; Long Branch Sheet, 1901; Shark River Sheet, 1903. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 375 



Fletcher Lake (closed and fresh; pleasure lake). 



Wesley Lake (closed and fresh; pleasure lake). 



Sunset Lake (closed and fresh; pleasure lake). 



Deal Lake (open by a closed sluice gate filled with sand and totally 

 fresh). 



Whale Pond = Takanassee Lake (open by a made channel, but 

 entirely fresh). 



Shrewsbury River (opening northward into Sandy Hook Bay and 

 navigable to large excursion steamers). 



All of these ponds, whether fresh or salt, have had essentially the 

 same physiographic history. They have all started as the outlets of 

 larger or smaller streams, which flowed sluggishly seaward from a 

 more elevated but still almost level interior. Upon reaching the 

 immediate sea coast, these streams had to contend with the sand of 

 the traveling beaches, which form an almost unbroken line for a 

 thousand miles from Montauk Point, on the eastern end of Long Island, 

 to Jupiter Inlet, in Florida. These sandy beaches never maintain the 

 same relative position, but are moved about by the ocean currents and 

 more fickle winds. Since the beaches have been inhabited by summer 

 and winter residents attempts have been made to stop the movement 

 of the sand by the construction of jetties, stone walls and revetments, 

 with some degree of success, but in the past the action of nature's forces 

 were untrammeled. The continuity of such beaches is broken only 

 by the action of a river. The Hudson River, flowing out of New York 

 Bay, breaks the beach between the Navesink Highlands and Long 

 Island. There has been a big contest for supremacy between the 

 beach and the river. Coney Island has crept out like a crooked finger 

 from the east, and Sandy Hook has traveled up several miles from the 

 south. But the great river has kept open its channel to the sea, not- 

 withstanding the fact that Fire Island Inlet has drifted to the west at 

 the average rate of three miles in sixty years, or nearly 260^feet per 

 annum. The encroachment of these bars threatens the channels 

 which lead into the Narrows and New York Bay, so that until recently 

 the largest steamers had to wait outside for the tides, while the least 

 deviation from the channel insured their grounding. All of the rivers 

 south of Sandy Hook have had a similar contest with the sand beaches. 

 The Shrewsbury and Navesink rivers have had such a struggle to keep 

 open their outlet to the sea. 4 The sandy beach, however, succeeded in

 lished in England in 1777, where these rivers are represented as open to the sea.

 Jersey, 1905: 27-95; 1907: 72-81), where by photographs and diagrams the

closing the mouths of both rivers, which united together into a common 

 stream, cutting its way past the Navesink Highlands and emptying into 

 Sandy Hook Bay. Even to-day the low sand beach is so narrow that 

 often the sea breaks entirely over it, and this is particularly true of 

 the portion immediately in front of the Navesink Highlands, for here 

 it is barely wide enough to accommodate double railroad tracks and a 

 carriage road, protected as they are from the full force of the ocean 

 storms and high tides by a sea wall of stone and piling. This narrow 

 strip of sand, about six miles long, connects Sandy Hook with the 

 mainland. All of the smaller streams have been obliged to meet the 

 same sand encroachment; but many of them, unable to keep their 

 outlets open, have been converted into salt ponds, and if shut off 

 from the sea for any length of time they have been gradually trans- 

 formed into fresh water ponds. Only two of the larger rivers have 

 been equal to the task of cutting through the barrier beach, viz., 

 Shark River and Manasquan River. The outlet of Shark River several 

 years ago had been almost closed, except a narrow channel which one 

 could step across at low tide; but in the summer of 1908 the river 

 had a new lease of life, its inlet opened wider than ever, so that naphtha 

 launches drawing several feet of water entered from the open ocean. 

 During the summer of 1909, however, the sand barrier had traveled so 

 far north that a southeast storm on July 23, 1909, completely closed 

 the inlet. 5 



We can arrange the inlets and ponds in a regular sequence, with 

 reference to the stage which they have reached in their developmental 

 history (see note 16), beginning as ocean inlets and ending in closed fresh 

 water ponds. In an earlier paragraph I have arranged all the known 

 bodies of water in geographic order. Their physiographic sequence is 

 somewhat as follows: 



1. Salt Water 6 (Active Tidal Flow). 



Manasquan River; Shark River (open until July 23, 1909, when 

 it closed, to be opened by digging away the bar on August 13, 

 1909) ; Navesink and Shrewsbury Rivers ; Wreck Pond (open and 

 salt in 1908, closed by a sand bar and fresh during 1909 until 

 August 13, when the inlet was opened to the sea). 



5 The only open inlet from Barnegat Inlet to Sandy Hook during the summer 

 of 1909 after July 23, when Shark River Inlet closed, was at Manasquan. Later, 

 on August 13, 1909, Wreck Pond Inlet was opened, and on August 12 that of 

 Shark River. 



6 In all cases the character of the water was determined by a hydrometer that, 

 read 0-50 degrees Beaume. When the scale read degrees the water was 

 considered undoubtedly fresh. 




1909. J NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 377 



2. Fresh Water. 



(A) With Natural Surroundings — Wreck Pond (salt in 1908; 

 fresh in 1909); Como Lake (sluiceway to sea); Sylvan Lake = 

 Duck Pond (sluiceway to sea). 



(B) With Artificial Surroundings (pleasure lakes) — Spring Lake; 

 Silver Lake. 



(C) With Protected Shores (pleasure lakes) — Fletcher Lake; 

 Wesley Lake (sluiceway to sea); Sunset Lake; Deal Lake 

 (sluiceway to sea, opened fifteen years ago); Whale Pond = 

 Takanassee Lake (sluiceway to the sea). 



The vegetation will be considered in the sequence which follows 

 the physiographic history of the bodies of water mentioned above. 

 Wherever the tidal action is sufficient to keep the basins of the rivers 

 in the first category filled with salt water, we have the level areas along 

 their banks and the sand and muck islands formed by the action of 

 the currents covered with a typic salt marsh vegetation. 



Salt Marsh Formation. 



The salt marsh areas in New Jersey with which we are concerned 

 occur around the shores of Newark Bay, and extend for some 

 distance along the Hackensack and Passaic rivers. There is no salt 

 marsh on the banks of the Hudson River, and none at present in 

 New Jersey on New York Bay. Salt marshes extend along Arthur 

 Kill and inland along the shores of the rivers that empty into 

 it. Raritan Bay has its marshes where there are indentations and 

 where small streams empty into it, and for several miles along both 

 banks of the Raritan River there are extensive flats. The shores of 

 the Navesink River, except a few islands near its mouth, are destitute 

 of salt marshes ; but the Shrewsbury River has low, swampy shores, 

 covering some space between the highland and the shore. Then comes 

 a stretch of sea coast extending from North Long Branch to Bay 

 Head, along which the mainland is washed by the ocean waves; the 

 beach is abrupt, the sand is coarse and there is no marsh, except on 

 the banks of Stockton Lake, Shark River, Wreck Pond and Manasquan 

 River. South of Bay Head the salt marshes back of the sand islands 

 are very extensive, as described in previous papers. 



Three kinds of salt marshes may be distinguished in New Jersey. 

 The first, and smallest in area, is that which is covered at every 

 mean high tide. The second in area is rarely covered at ordinary 

 tides, but so little above mean high water that even the slightest rise, 

 due to wind storm or moon changes, results in a partial covering with 

 water. The third type of marsh is that above mean high tide and more 




378 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Aug., 



or less completely covered with vegetation. All three kinds of marsh 

 may be covered at the time of the Spring and Fall tides, and they are 

 intersected by ditches, thorofares, and deeper boat channels, which 

 give a characteristic appearance to the monotonous landscape. 



The following analysis of a machine-cut sod, 10 x 10 x 27 inches, 

 weighing 121 pounds, was made by Dr. Jacob G. Lipman, of the New 

 Jersey Agricultural College, from material taken August 13, 1907, on 

 a Raritan marsh opposite Sayreville:

Nitrogen, 0.65 per cent. 0.63 per cent.

The spongy, fibrous character of the upper portion of the sod, ex- 

 tending from twelve to eighteen inches and composed of roots and 

 other vegetable matter, is gradually modified in its lower portion. 

 The distinct root structure tends to disappear, and with the darker 

 color the entire mass becomes more compact and resembles muck 

 rather than peat. The proportionate amount of carbon and ash are 

 both increased, while the proportion of organic matter is diminished. 7 



The development of the salt marsh vegetation was studied in a 

 number of places. When the mud flats rise above the surface at any 

 stage of tide plants begin to invade them. Such a bar, uncovered 

 in the Shrewsbury River five or six years ago, according to a fisherman 

 who lived in the neighborhood, is now covered by a dense growth of 

 Spartina stricta maritima, a grass which has large root-stocks that ex- 

 tend deep into the mud. At the end of each year the tops of this wiry 

 grass die, and new shoots come up the next Spring; mud and other 

 materials are held at the base of the stems until the surface is gradually 

 built up, when the first type of salt marsh passes into the second. 

 -Gradually other plants come in that have a root system adapted to 

 growth under the conditions provided by mud covered and uncovered 

 alternately by tidal flow, until the zonal arrangement of plants which

characterizes the long established marshes arises. This stage of 

 development seems to mark the culmination of the salt marsh vege- 

 tation. If the marsh rises above the level where the typic salt marsh 

 plants can grow, a different kind of drainage of the marsh is established 

 and the salt marsh plants are replaced by others. The decay of the 

 remains of the salt marsh plants produces holes here and there over the 

 surface of the marsh, which, in the parlance of the sea coast farmer, 

 becomes "rotten." 



The composition of the salt marsh vegetation of the northern 

 New Jersey coast can be illustrated best by a study of several 

 typic kinds of marshes as they occur from Sandy Hook Bay south to 

 Manasquan Inlet. The description and the sketches which accom- 

 pany them will illustrate the similarities, as well as the differences, 

 induced by a difference in the edaphic factors of the several localities. 8 



The salt marshes at Water Witch Park, a resort on the north slopes 

 of the Navesink Highlands, along Sandy Hook Bay, along the channel 

 edge of Plum Island, along the east front of the Highlands, a marsh 

 island in the Navesink River, at Navesink Beach and at Normandie 

 consist of Spartina stricta maritime/, (sp. gr. 1.017-1.0185) where a 

 muddy bottom is found, but it disappears where sand and gravel form 

 the river bottom. Associated with this salt grass in front of the Nave- 

 sink Highlands are found Spartina polystachya, together with Atriplex 

 kastata and Tissa marina. At Navesink Beach is a low mud island 

 formed five or six years ago, but now completely covered with Spartina 

 stricta maritima. The second inner strip consists of the low salt grass 

 Spartina patens, together with patches of Salicornia herbacea, as at 

 Water Witch Park, Scirpus pungens at Navesink Highlands, with a 

 few specimens of Solidago sempervirens and Salicornia herbacea. On the 

 marsh island in the Navesink River, Spartina patens is associated with 

 Distichlis spicata, covering nearly half an acre of the island, between 

 which and the outer fringe of salt grass occur in mixed growth (sp. gr. 

 1.0180) Limonium carolinianum, Spartina patens, Plantago maritima, 



8 The edaphic conditions were determined during the summer of 1909 by means 

 of a specific gravity hydrometer with a scale reading from 0.995 to 1.065, good 

 to four decimal places by a secondary subdivision of the scale. An attached 

 thermometer allowed readings to be made from — 15° to +45° Centigrade. 

 By means of this hydrometer the character of the submerging water, or water from 

 holes dug in the marsh soil, which influenced the roots or bases of each marsh 

 species, was determined. The results are given in specific gravities. Abso- 

 lutely pure water (distilled) reads 1.0000 on the scale, and sea water taken from 

 the surf at Belmar at 21.1° C. reads 1.0215, so that the figures from the different 

 marsh habitats approach closely the first figure if the water is fresh or the second 

 figure if more or less saline. The specific gravities, as far as possible, are given 

 in parentheses, leaving the detailed results for a subsequent paper.

 Suasda linearis and Chenopodium rubrum. At Navesink Beach 

 Salsola kali has invaded this strip of Spartina patens, and at Nor- 

 mandie Atriplex hastata and Suceda linearis ( = Dondia americana) form 

 almost pure associations, while at this place, between the low dunes 

 and the last mentioned marsh strip, are found associations of Lathyrus 

 maritimus, mixed with Solidago sempervirens and Oenothera biennis. 



The third inner strip of salt marsh at Water Witch Park is com- 

 posed of an association of Scirpus pungens, Gerardia maritima, Pluchea 

 camphorata and Cyperus erythrorhizos, while the fourth strip of vege- 

 tation is characterized by tall-growing herbs and shrubs, viz., Scirpus 

 pungens, Panicum virgatum, Polygonum sagittatum, Hibiscus moscheu- 

 tos, Eupatorium perfoliatum, Solidago sempervirens and Baccharis 

 halimifolia, some which suggest proximity of fresh water conditions. 



The salt marsh along the upper portion of Wreck Pond shows a 

 modification of the outer fringing strip of Spartina stricta maritima. 

 Along the north shore of the Pond edaphic conditions control the 

 distribution of plants, for the fringing growth of Spartina stricta 

 maritima (sp. gr. 1.014) is not continuous, but is more or less inter- 

 rupted by tongues of Spartina patens, while in two places Scirpus 

 pungens in two isolated associations is the character plant which 

 touches the channel currents. Back of the tall salt grass is found an 

 almost continuous strip of Spartina patens, in some places mixed with 

 Scirpus pungens and Panicum virgatum. From the distribution of the 

 plants and the direction of the shore lines, it would seem that the 

 ocean currents are deflected against the north shore, where the salt 

 marsh conditions are more typically found, while the fresh water of 

 the river flows seaward along the south shore. This, however, is not 

 the determining factor in the replacement of Spartina stricta maritima 

 along the south shore by Spartina patens, for the north shore has a 

 muddy bottom and the south shore a gravelly one. 



Plum Island Salt Marsh (Fig. 1). 



Plum Island is found lying between the southern end of Sandy 

 Hook and the Highlands of Navesink. 



It is irregular in shape and consists of low sandhills surrounded 

 by salt marsh, as indicated in Fig. 1, which also indicates the areas 

 of marsh covered by this survey (I, II, HI). Considering the com- 

 position of the salt marsh at the locality marked I on the sketch map 

 of Plum Island, we find the outer strip (sp. gr. 1.016) (Fig. 2) composed 

 of a pure growth of Spartina stricta maritima (X), which is succeeded by

 of the first lagoon (II) is completely surrounded by a circumarea 

 (sp. gr. 1.016) of Spartina stricta maritima (X), in the midst of which 

 arises an association of Spartina polystachya ($). This circumarea 

 is in turn surrounded by a continuous one (sp. gr. 1.018) of Baccharis 

 halimifolia (9), in front of which in two small associations (sp. gr. 

 1.020) occur Spartina patens (V), together with Salicornia herbacea

The second lagoon studied is a much smaller one, and is located on 

 the map (Fig. 1) at the place marked III. As with the other lagoon, it 

 is completely surrounded by a circumarea of Spartina stricta maritima 

 (X), and it is fringed on one side by a broad strip of Spartina patens 

 (V). Touching the tall salt grass on the other side (sp. gr. 1.003) 

 are found Salicornia herbacea (H ) and Limonium carolinianum (A), 

 Atriplex hastata and Suceda linearis, while here and there occur clumps

of Baccharis halimifolia (0), at least four such having been seen in 

 the immediate neighborhood of this lagoon. This lagoon basin is sur- 

 rounded by low sandy slopes, barren on one side, but covered with 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 385 



Ammophila arenaria (A) and Solidago sempervirens on the other, 

 while a thicket where Rhus radicans is prominent occurs on the higher 

 sand slopes (Fig. 4). The water of this lagoon, although it is near the 

 center of the island, remains salt, because at high tides it is replenished 

 by the entrance of sea water, which enters through a valley-like depres- 

 sion running diagonally across the island. 



Salt Marshes along Shark River. 



Shark River (Fig. 5) rises inland about seven miles from the coast. 

 The inner line of its watershed is marked approximately by the New 

 Jersey Southern Railroad, running between Farmingdale and Pine 

 Brook near Eatontown. It runs seaward in two main branches, fork- 

 ing from each other close to Shark River Bay. The southern branch 

 rises in elevated country (100-164 feet contour) near Shark River 

 Station on the New Jersey Southern Railroad. The northern branch 

 rises near Centerville, and flows approximately southeast to join the 

 other branch before they enter Shark River Bay, which is fresh at 

 its head, but gradually becomes more salt near its narrow outlet to 

 the sea, more or less surrounded by salt marshes or salt marsh islands 

 (Fig. 5). The bay is about two miles long from east to west. The 

 outlet is marked by the line of the New York & Long Branch Rail- 

 road, which crosses by a trestle bridge. Below the trestle the river 

 channel is scoured by the rapidly moving inflowing and outflowing 

 tides, and its banks are lined with salt marshes now to be described. 

 The close proximity of these marshes to Belmar enabled me to visit 

 them frequently on foot and in a boat, and to construct a map which 

 represents the distribution of the salt marsh plants (Fig. 5). 



The salt marsh vegetation of the south shore of the river, between 

 the ocean and the trolley bridge, will be described in detail first. The 

 river channel (sp. gr. 1.0212) is fringed by Spartina stricta maritima 

 (X) where the muddy shore is submerged at high tide (sp. gr. 1.0140). 

 This grass also fringes the marsh island, which was originally formed 

 by tidal action. Near the ocean front Spartina patens (V) forms a 

 strip which is barely touched by salt water at high tide, while in differ- 

 ent association and on the same level is found Scirpus pungens (Z) 

 associated with Limonium carolinianum (A). These plants are backed 

 by low dunes covered with Triodia cuprea, Ammophila arenaria } 

 Strophostylcs helvola, Lathyrus maritimus, Euphorbia poly go ni folia, 

 Cakile edentula, Cassia nictitans, Ampelopsis quinque folia, Solidago 

 sempervirens, Trifolium repens, T. hybridum and Xanthium echinatum.

 by this grass, as shown in Fig. 5, are found pure associations as follows :

ing around the head of a slough at this point of the shore; 3, Juncus 

 Gerardi (J), one patch of which surrounded a low dune covered with 

 Panicum virgatum. A high dune spit projecting into the marsh was 

 covered by Panicum virgatum, Xanthium echinatum, (Enothera biennis 

 and Ammophila arenaria. 



The straight portion of the main shore, between this V-shaped marsh 

 on the one hand and the marsh island on the other, is occupied by a 

 narrow salt marsh, the vegetation of which consists of a frontal strip of 

 Scirpus pungens (Z), out of which grow Baccharis halimifolia (V) and 

 Hibiscus moscheutos. This strip is continued by two pure associations 

 of Spartina patens (V) (sp. gr. 1.0069) and Scirpus pungens (Z) re- 

 spectively. A second shoreward marsh strip is occupied by fresh 

 water marsh plants, such as Impatiens fulva ( = /. biflora), Sambucus 

 canadensis and Polygonum sagittatum, while the drier portions of this 

 strip are characterized by Pa nicum virgatum. The second short offset 

 between D and E Streets, Belmar, is noted for a projecting tongue of 

 low marshland completely surrounded by a growth of Spartina stricta 

 maritima (X) in full flower (August), while surrounded by the taller 

 salt marsh grass is a lower flowerless growth of Spartina stricta mari- 

 tima (X), with two associations of Distichlis spicata (0) and one of 

 Spartina patens (V). Immediately back of this marsh tongue are 

 found several strips of vegetation. In front is an irregular association 

 of Spartina patens (X) in soil merely wetted by the rising tide, but 

 seldom entirely submerged. Inside of this is a narrow association 

 of Scirpus pungens (Z), succeeded in the drier shore soil by Baccharis 

 halimifolia (#) and Hibiscus moscheutos (sp. gr. 1.0000), while in places 

 in this strip occur fresh-water swamp plants, such as Cicuta maculata, 

 Peltandra virginica, Scirpus. robustus and Impatiens fulva ( = /. bi- 

 flora). Situated between the outer strip of Spartina stricta maritima 

 (X) and the inner fresh water marsh strip occur longitudinally disposed 

 three alternating associations, viz. : two societies of Scirpus pungens 

 (Z), between which is found an association of Spartina patens (V) and 

 Scirpus robustus. 



The gradual slopes of the shore above the marshland is covered 

 with Panicum virgatum, Rhus radicans, Xanthium echinatum, Baccharis 

 halimifolia (»), over which clambers Sicyos angulatus. 



Vegetation of the Marsh Island. 



The marsh island in Shark River with a slough at its western end is 

 completely surrounded by Spartina stricta maritima (X), except in 

 two places where the shore is a little more elevated. At one place 




388 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Aug., 



Baccharis halimifolia (#) and Panicum virgatum in dry sandy soil 

 above tide action forms the border growth, while on the opposite side 

 of the island in wetter soil is found the edge of an extensive association 

 of J uncus Gerardi (J), which here touches the river channel. An ex- 

 tensive growth of Spartina stricta maritima (X) covers the western 

 end of the island surrounding the slough marked on the map (Fig. 5). 

 As this growth of salt grass is found in soil only covered at high tide 

 in its development here, it is in marked contrast to its growth in the 

 shore mud, which is never practically uncovered by tidal flow. Else- 

 where in the center of the island occur associations of 1, Distichlis 

 spicata (O) with Limonium carolinianum (A); 2, J uncus Gerardi (J); 

 3, Spartina patens (V), with and without Iva imbricata, while a small 

 dune is covered with Panicum virgatum and Solidago semper vir ens. 



Vegetation of the North (Avon) Shore of Shark River. 



Beginning at the beach front, where it covers a wide area of shore 

 mud, and extending in a narrow strip to the trolley bridge, where it 

 again widens, Spartina stricta maritima occurs as a border growth. 

 Just back of the ocean dunes, this association surrounds several smaller 

 ones of Spartina patens (V) alone, Distichlis spicata (0) alone, Scirpus 

 pungens (Z) alone and Phragmites communis ( * ), which grows at the 

 inner edge of the marshland proper, as do Salicornia herbacea (tH ) and 

 Limonium carolinianum, while in a smaller growth of Spartina stricta 

 maritima (X) back of the border strip grow Scirpus robustus and 

 Baccharis halimifolia (0). Lying between this strip and the sandy 

 shore, where Panicum virgatum is the character plant, is an extensive 

 association of Scirpus pungens (Z). As the shore bluff comes within 

 a few feet of the water's edge for a considerable distance along the 

 north shore of the river, the marshland narrows until only the fringing 

 growth of Spartina stricta maritima occupies the shore line, with a 

 narrow strip just back of it of Spartina patens (V), which as elsewhere 

 grows in the soil rarely exposed to the full tidal action. In a triangular 

 corner formed by the bluff as one side of the triangle, the trolley road 

 and the river as the other two sides, the marsh widens with a lagoon 

 in its center. The shore growth of Spartina stricta maritima (X) is 

 continuous with the growth of the grass which surrounds the water 

 of the lagoon (sp. gr. 1.0180). Forming conspicuous elements of the 

 vegetation of this triangle, and here as elsewhere to be distinguished 

 by the color of the plants, are several associations of marsh species. 

 One of the largest associations in contact with the bluff is composed of 

 Scirpus pungens (Z), surrounding Iva imbricata and Hibiscus moscheutos 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 389 



(sp. gr. 1.0000), while Pluchea camphorata mixes its growth with the 

 sedge, as does J uncus Gerardi (J), which surrounds a low sand dune 

 covered with Panicum virgatum. In three isolated areas is found an 

 association of Spartina patens (V), while back of Spartina stricta 

 maritima (X) on the roadside of the lagoon occurs an association of 

 J uncus Gerardi (J), at one end of which Limonium carolinianum enters 

 the association. At the head of the lagoon, at the inner edge of the 

 marsh soil, Cyperus erythrorhizos and Polygonum ramosissimum, which 

 indicate beginning fresh water conditions, have established themselves. 

 Outside of the influence of the salt water, where the inner edge of the 

 salt marsh (sp. gr. 1.0000) owes its wetness to rains and fresh water 

 springs, just in front of the river bluff occur plants of fresh water 

 swamps, such as the shrubs Alnus serrulata, Pyrus arbutifolia, Clethra 

 alnifolia and the herbs Vernonia noveboracensis , Eupatorium pur- 

 pureum, Polygonum sagittaturn, Osmunda cinnamomea, Sagittaria 

 variabilis, Cicuta maculata and Lobelia cardinalis. 



Transition to Fresh Water Ponds. 



Upper Wreck Pond. — We have seen that the appearance of Spartina 

 patens indicates that the soil is only periodically flooded with salt 

 water. Above the carriage road, where the forest approaches the 

 water's edge, Spartina stricta maritima gradually thins out, and its 

 place as a border plant is taken by Scirpus pungens (sp. gr. 1.000), 

 Scirpus lacustris and Spartina polystaehya . But the persistence of this 

 grass here, where the fresh water conditions are becoming pronounced, 

 is perhaps explainable by the fact that the periodic entrance of salt 

 water prevents the replacement of this grass entirely by typic fresh 

 water vegetation, which is unable to survive a short exposure to salt 

 water; while Spartina stricta maritima not only withstands salt water, 

 but actually thrives in it, and also adapts itself to growth in water 

 which varies its salinity within wide limits, becoming almost fresh 

 when the inland rains are especially heavy or when the inlets of the 

 streams are closed by sand bars during severe storms, as during the 

 summer of 1909. During this summer the outlet of Wreck Pond was 

 closed to the sea until, as indicated by the hydrometer, the water 

 became entirely fresh, and yet Spartina stricta maritima and Spartina 

 patens persisted in their usual habitats, flowering as usual, even when 

 partially submerged by the overflow of fresh Avater during heavy 

 summer rains. 9 However, before we reach the place where this change 



9 This matter, as indicated by the sp. gr. hydrometer, will appear in a later 

 paper, but it should be emphasized here that salt water plants stand submer- 

 gence in fresh water much better than fresh water plants in salt water. 




390 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Aug., 



occurs, the following marsh strips may be recognized, beginning with 

 the outer one, which consists of Spartina stricta maritima (sp. gr. 1.003). 

 Then comes a strip of Spartina patens and a middle one of Panicum 

 virgatum, filled in between with Spartina patens and S. polystachya. 

 In the shoreward strip at the edge of the woods, where the salt marsh 

 vegetation merges with the fresh water vegetation (sp. gr. 1.000), 

 occur clumps of Cicuta maculata, Iris versicolor, Hibiscus moscheutos, 

 Polygonum sagittatum, P. pennsylvanicum, P. arifolium, Eryngium 

 virginianum, Ptilimnium capillaceum, Hydrocotyle umbellata, Lobelia 

 cardinalis, Convolvulus sepium and Impatiens fulva (visited by hum- 

 ming birds). The third strip may be considered to be the tension one, 

 where there is a gradual blending of the salt water and fresh water 

 vegetation. As one ascends the stream the salt marsh plants dwindle, 

 until not a trace of them is left and the marsh becomes entirely a fresh 

 water marsh, covered with plants which lower down merely fringed the 

 inner margin of the salt marsh. 



Sylvan Lake is the receptacle for the fresh water of a small stream 

 which rises in two forks in Mt. Prospect Cemetery, west of Ocean 

 Grove (80 feet contour). These two branches unite in a small pond 

 at Ocean Grove Heights, and the main stream flows seaward a distance 

 of a mile, until it enters Sylvan Lake (Duck Pond of the survey map), 

 which is about three-quarters of a mile long. As Sylvan Lake is shut 

 off from the ocean by a low sand bar, with a timbered sluiceway still 

 connecting it with the sea during high tides, it is sometimes supplied 

 with salt water, which enters the pond by means of the usually dry 

 sluiceway, which has been left as a means of keeping the water level of 

 the lake within certain limits. We can divide the vegetation of the 

 lake basin into two main divisions: (1) The vegetation uninfluenced 

 or rarely influenced by salt water, and growing in the western part of 

 the pond where the water is kept fresh by the stream which enters at 

 this end, and (2) the vegetation influenced more or less directly by 

 the sea water, when it enters by the sluice during exceptionally high 

 tides, which may rise high enough to enter the pond only three or four 

 times each year, and in the winter time, when the vegetation in the 

 pond, and surrounding it, being in its winter state, would be very little 

 injured by an overflow of salt water. Consequently the water of most 

 of the pond, especially near the landward end, is fresh, while near the 

 seaward end it is usually fresh, but brackish only after the sea water 

 has entered the pond during some high side, enabling a few salt marsh 

 species to persist, although generally subjected to fresh water con- 

 ditions (see note 9). 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 391 



One, therefore, notices the entire absence of such typic salt plants 

 as Spartina stricta maritima, Distichlis spicata, Salicornia herbacea, 

 S. mucronata, Limonium carolinianum and Suceda linearis, while the rem- 

 nant of this true salt marsh vegetation left at the margin of the pond, 

 owing to the occasional entrance of salt water, consists of such plants 

 as Spartina patens and J uncus Gerardi. 



Vegetation in Proximity to the Ocean. 



The low ground margining Sylvan Lake at its seaward end is occu- 

 pied by Scirpus pungens at the water's edge, while back of it occur 

 Spartina patens. Hibiscus moscheutos and J uncus Gerardi, together 

 with Elodes virgin tea and J uncus canadensis. The tall reed grass 

 Phragmitcs communis forms a pure association at this level, as does 

 also Cladium mariscoides mixed with. Solidago sempervirens. The 

 cattail, Typha angustifolia, is found in small cove-like indentations 

 of the shore, while Nymphcea odorata with Panicum crus-galli occur 

 in small sloughs found here and there along the outer shore line. The 

 low sand levels above the marsh are covered with Myrica carolinensis, 

 in association with Panicum virgatum, Baccharis halimifolia, Stro- 

 phostyles helvola, Baptisia tinctoria, Vaccinium atrococcum, Ilex glabra 

 and Prunus maritima, extending back to the edge of the woods behind 

 what was formerly, before grading operations altered the original 

 conditions, the dune complex of my earlier papers. The following 

 plants, Vaccinium atrococcum, Ilex glabra and Baptisia tinctoria, which 

 enter the dune formation, may be considered to be elements which 

 have invaded the formation from an inland pine barren source of 

 supply. 



Vegetation Controlled by Fresh Water. 



Early in my study of the flora of Sylvan Lake my attention was 

 directed to the north shore, because the south shore of the lake had 

 been altered too much by the encroachment of the building line of 

 Avon-by-the-Sea. Only a few patches of the original vegetation was 

 left, and so much altered as not worth a detailed study. Three strips 

 of vegetation can be recognized along the northern shore of the lake, 

 and in the description of them which follows the plants will be men- 

 tioned in the order in which they were collected in walking from the 

 western end to the eastern end. This plan is pursued because it was 

 found impossible to recognize associations of the species, because they 

 were so mixed together, especially in the second strip, as not to be 

 separable into distinct groups. 




392 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Aug., 



The lake is almost choked with a green alga, Cladophora flavescens, 

 which has invaded the water lily associations and threatens to exter- 

 minate them. Not only that, but the lake for boating purposes has 

 been ruined by the floating masses of Cladophora which at times of low 

 water form mats of algal felt, and unless copper sulphate is used to 

 destroy this plant the lake will be converted gradually into a fresh 

 water marsh. 



The water's edge is margined generally by Panicum crus-galli and 

 Scirpus pungens, with which in close association were found, but in 

 varying abundance, Panicum virgatum, Scirpus pungens, Typha 

 angustifolia and Nympluea odorata, which formed in most places the out- 

 ward edge of this strip, growing in the shallow water in several places 

 and extending its growth out over the surface of the lake. 



The only plant of the second strip which may be said to grow in 

 pure association is Cladium mariscoides, which forms back of Panicum 

 crus-galli of the first strip a growth in some places 100 feet long, ex- 

 tending back to drier soil. Associated with this sedge grow Polygala 

 cruciata and Sabbatia angularis. The second strip, however, is charac- 

 terized by the presence of Gerardia purpurea, Rhexia rirginica, 

 Drosera linearis, D. filiformis, Fuirena squarrosa hispida, Panicum 

 virgatum, Polygonum sagittatum, Hibiscus moscheutos and Lobelia spicata. 

 In a few wet places sphagnum occurs, and here grow Vaccinium macro- 

 carpon and Drosera filiformis. 



Fresh Water Pond Formations. 



When the sand bar formed across the end of an inlet has become 

 permanent, the lake formed back of it gradually becomes converted 

 into a basin holding nothing but fresh water (instance Wreck Pond 

 in 1909, with salt marsh species), and the vegetation becomes eventually 

 that found in fresh water ponds and along their margin. Three such 

 fresh water lakes were studied carefully on the northern New Jersey 

 coast, viz. : Como Lake, a small uncharted pond back of Como Lake 

 and formerly part of it, and Silver Lake. Incidentally in this survey 

 Bradley Lake and Wesley Lake at Ocean Grove and Sunset Lake in 

 Asbury Park were visited, but it was found that the banks of 

 these lakes were sodded with cultivated grasses and planted with 

 shrubs for ornamental purposes, so that these lakes, although formed 

 in a similar manner to the ones studied, are omitted from further con- 

 sideration. 



Silver Lake.— Silver Lake is situated in the borough of Belmar and 

 is entirely surrounded by summer cottages (Fig. 5). It is less than 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 393 



half a mile long, and its banks have been sodded, the undergrowth 

 has been removed and the tree vegetation, notably Pinus rigida, has 

 been left, giving a park-like aspect to the surroundings. The authori- 

 ties periodically clear the lake of all vegetation, in order to provide 

 for the water carnivals which are held some time during the summer 

 months. But yet the vegetation grows almost as rapidly as it is 

 removed, and constant vigilance must be exercised to prevent the 

 filling of the shallow lake basin. The most persistent of these plants 

 is Potamogeton perfoliatus, which forms extensive associations here 

 and there in the quieter portions of the lake. Another persistent 

 plant is Elodea (Philotria) canadensis, which grows so fast as to choke 

 portions of the lake. Upon this aquatic plant grow epiphytically, 

 according to a study of microscopic material collected in the summer 

 of 1908, a blue-green alga, Mastigonema sejunctum, which lives in tufts 

 or soft mosses on the leaves of Elodea, as also a diatom, Gomphonema 

 constrictum. The filaments of Mastigonema are rather rigid, straight 

 and spuriously branched, and their apex is delicately hair-like, while 

 heterocysts are found at the base of each of the branches. The diatom, 

 Gomphonema constrictum, has wedge-shaped frustules in the girdle- 

 view, and in the specimens studied they were attached by their inferior 

 smaller extremities to a system of hyaline threads that form bound 

 together a stalk, which attaches them to the Elodea leaf. The fresh 

 water plankton of this lake was found to consist in September, 190S. 

 of Spirogyra crassa (which lives over the winter), Anaboena flos-aquv 

 var. circinalis and Scenedesmus obliquus. The water silk, Spirogyra 

 crassa, formed floating masses near the shore (found by me also in April, 

 1909), while Anabama flos-oqim var. circinalis about the end of August 

 was in such abundance as to suggest "the flowering of the mere." 

 Its beaded filaments formed most beautiful coils or spirals. 



Como Lake. — Como Lake will be treated in a few years like those at 

 Asbury Park and Ocean Grove, as the building of summer houses is 

 fast approaching it, so that these observations will preserve to botanic 

 posterity the only statement as to the original flora which surrounded 

 it. Following the south shore first, we can recognize four strips of 

 plants, viz. : (1) the water strip; (2) the wet ground strip ; (3) the dry 

 ground strip ; (4) the forest strip. The first two strips are practically 

 the same, because the vegetation of the wet soil encroaches upon the 

 water surface. The west shore is somewhat gravelly and sandy, and 

 here I found, beginning at the western end of the pond and walk- 

 ing eastward, the following characteristic plants: Agrostis hyemalis 

 ( = A. scabra), Polygonum sagittatum, P. acre, Cyperus erythrorhizos 




394 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Aug. , 



(abundant), Panicum crus-galli (occasional), Scirpus pungens. Then 

 at the eastern end, I noted in the water strip Juncus canadensis, J. 

 debilis, Cyperus dentatus var. ctenostachys , C. erythrorhizos, Scirpus 

 pungens, Polygonum sp., Panicum crus-galli. On a small rounded 

 bar in the lake near the ocean grew in the summer of 1908 

 Panicum crus-galli, Polygonum acre, Cyperus erythrorhizos, C. Nuttallii. 

 Where a small spring enters the lake, I found Nasturtium officinale, 

 Polygonum acre and Spirogyra sp. 



The third strip on the south side of the lake consists of plants which 

 occupy low sandy slopes. Such are Myrica carolinensis , Solidago 

 sempervirens, Panicum virgatum, Strophostyles helvola, Rhus copallina, 

 Baptisia tinctoria, Cyperus dentatus (proliferated sedge), according to 

 my notes. 



The seaward end of the north shore has been graded. Beginning 

 at the edge of the improvements(?) and walking westward along the 

 shore, the following strips of vegetation were recognized and studied: 

 (1) the marsh strip at the edge of the water; (2) the dry sandy strip; 

 (3) the forest strip. The marsh strip, proceeding westward, is charac- 

 terized by Scirpus pungens, Polygonum acre, Cyperus erythrorhizos, 

 Polygonum sagittatum, Gerardia purpurea, Ptilimnium capillaceum, 

 Panicum crus-galli (nearly always at the water's edge). A small 

 stream which enters between the pine woods showed in its expanded 

 portion the white water lily, Nymphcea odorata, and at the edge Panicum 

 crus-galli, Polygonum sagittatum and P. acre.. Passing a sharp bend 

 of the shore the marsh vegetation increases in density with the asso- 

 ciation of Scirpus pungens, Gerardia, purpurea, Polygonum acre, P. 

 sagittatum, Ptilimnium capillaceum, Hypericum canadensis, Bidens 

 frondosa, Hibiscus moscheutos, Scirpus cyperinus, Panicum crus-galli. 

 The bur reed, Sparganium euycarpum, forms a small association at 

 the western end of the lake, while in front of the trolley embankment, 

 in water six inches deep, was found an association of Panicum crus- 

 galli, Cyperus erythrorhizos and Glyceria obtusa. Here the marsh ex- 

 pands into a triangular area, where I collected Polygonum sagittatum, 

 P. acre, Cladium mariscoides, Scirpus pungens (abundant), Eryngium 

 virginianum, Solidago tenuifolia, Panicum virgatum, Gerardia purpurea, 

 Ptilimnium capillaceum, Iris versicolor, while in another portion of 

 the marsh, alternating with the dry ground, grew Alnus serrulata, 

 Aspidium thelypteris, Cladium mariscoides, Aster subulatus and 

 Hibiscus moscheutos. 



The second strip, or that of the treeless dry ground, is characterized 

 by its extensive clumps of Panicum virgatum, with which grows Poly- 

 gala cruciata.

Separated from Como Lake by a carriage road, and situated in the 

 angle which this road forms with the main or trolley road, is a small 

 triangular pond of fresh water, completely covered with a small- 

 flowered variety of the white water lily, Nymphcea odorata, with the 

 margin of the pond fringed with a circumarea of Panicum crus-galli. 

 Como Lake proper has relatively no growth of water lilies, except as 

 previously noted in a small embayment of the shore, where a small 

 stream enters from the pine woods, and yet in the pond, cut off from 

 the main lake by the construction of the carriage road, it is the domi- 

 nant and exclusive plant. 



Fresh Water Swamp Formation. 



Como Swamp. — West of the trolley road is a swamp (Fig. 6) which 

 occupies the area covered formerly by a western extension of Lake 

 Como. but cut off from it by the construction of the wagon road. As 

 this swamp is fed by a small stream about three-eighths of a mile long, 

 there is a partially open channel running through the middle of it, and 

 a small fresh water lagoon has been formed at one side by a choking of 

 the former lake basin with vegetation. This extremely wet swamp 

 illustrates the last stage in the conversion of a salt water pond with its 

 salt marsh vegetation, first into a brackish pond with the suppression 

 of most salt water plants (Sylvan Lake stage) and then into a fresh 

 water lake with its characteristic vegetation (Como Lake stage), and 

 finally the invasion of the shallow lake with vegetation peculiar to 

 fresh water swamps (Como Swamp stage, Fig. 6). 



The channel (ditch) is blocked in its lower portion by sedges and 

 grasses, in the midst of which we find an association of Potamogeton sp. 

 (f), Polygonum acre (*) and Scirpus pungcns ( + ) surrounding a 

 smaller association of Sparganium eurycarpum (= Fig. 6). On the 

 north side of the ditch we find an association of Leersia oryzoides (±), 

 Panicum crus-galli ( I ) and a few scattered clumps of Typha angusti- 

 folia (9 ). A triangular-shaped association comprises Nymphcea 

 (Castalia) odorata (O), Scirpus pungens ( + ), Panicum crus-galli (I), 

 with a few scattered specimens of Scirpus lacustris (©), and the arrange- 

 ment of the plants suggests that the water lilies represent the original 

 facies which has been invaded by other specis. The cranberry, 

 Vaccinium macrocarpon (M), forms a pure association at the edge of 

 the marsh, while nearby J uncus canadensis (cT), Polygonum acre ( • ), 

 P. sagittatum ( T ), Nymphcea odorata (©) are in association (see Fig. 

 6). Along the north edge of Como Swamp two other associations are 

 found, one consisting of the admixture of Scirpus pungens ( + ), Poly-

gonum acre ( * ), P. sagittatum ( T ), Xyris caroliniana (* ), Eryngium 

 virginianum (E), Sabbatia angularis (A), while the other association 

 comprises Scirpus pungens ( + ), Rhynchospora glomerata (|), Poly- 

 gonum acre ( ' ), Ptilimnium capillaceum (</*), Juncus canadensis (cT). 

 The swamp on the south side of the ditch is more extensive, surround- 

 ing a central lagoon with water lilies (O). Here also are found pure 

 associations of Typha angustifolia (9), Rhynchospora glomerata (t),.

 abundantly in the Fall of the year. 



Relation of Salt Marsh to Salt Water. 



Sodium chloride in solution is known to have strong plasmolytic 

 properties, removing water from living cells, when these aie subjected 

 to its action, and hence causing the protoplasm to contract away 

 from the cell walls. Ordinary plants are soon killed when exposed 

 to the action of salt or salt water, and yet we have a group of plants, 

 the so-called halophytes, which possess great powers of resisting the 

 action of sodium chloride in solutions as strong as sea water. The 

 sea beach plants are excluded from consideration, because Kearney 10 

 has shown that the salt content of the shore sand is a negligible quan- 

 tity, and that some cultivated soils contain a larger percentage of 

 •common salt than the beach sand, so that of the strand plants the salt 

 marsh species are the only ones which belong to the halophytic class 

 of plants. Schimper" has called attention to the fact that any con- 

 siderable amount of salt in the cell sap is detrimental to the plant, and 

 that this fact explains the probable cause of the characteristic halo- 

 phytic modifications, which have to do with reducing the transpiration 

 current, which accounts for the abundant absorption of water with 

 various salts of the soil in solution. Warming, however, replied that 

 the reduction of transpiration would cause the increase of the salts 

 in the cell sap, and he suggested a theory, which is now the current 

 one, viz., that the protective contrivances, such as hairs, sunken 

 stomata, succulency, etc., against strong transpiration are necessary 

 in halophytic plants, because absorption of water from a salt solution 

 is slow and difficult. 



In the absence of experimental data which will enable us to arrange 

 the salt niarsh plants of New Jersey into a series with reference to their 

 greater or less power of resistance to salt water, 12 the following general

observations may be made. Evidently, as it is exposed along the 

 channels which it fringes to the full effect of salt water (sp. gr. 1.0185), 

 the salt grass Spartina stricta maritima is the best adapted of all the 

 species studied to the halophytic conditions under which such plants 

 grow. Second in order of resistance to the detrimental influence 

 of saline solutions should be mentioned Spartina patens, Salicornia 

 herbacea, S. mucronata, Limonium carolinianum (sp. gr. 1.018), 13 

 Baccharis halimifolia, Distichlis spicata and Juncus Gerardi. While to 

 a third group of still less resistant halophytic plants, I would include 

 Typha angustijolia, Scirpus robustus, Gerardia purpurea, Solidago 

 sempervirens and Atriplex hastata. Such plants as Hibiscus moscheu- 

 tos, Cicutamaculata, Peltandra virginica, Panicum crus-galli and Sparga- 

 nium eurycarpum, mentioned in the foregoing account, are plants 

 indicative of fresh water marsh conditions, and are not to be included 

 among the true halophytes. 



Without experimental data, which I will later supply in a detailed 

 manner, with reference to the halophytism of all of the above-men- 

 tioned plants, the observations of Ganong 14 and Graves 15 have an im- 

 portant bearing upon our study of the distribution of the vegetation 

 of the salt marshes of northern New Jersey. Ganong has found that 

 the root hairs of Salicornia herbacea can endure a 100 per cent, sea 

 water without plasmolysis ; those of Suwda maritima 80 per cent. ; 

 those of Plantago maritima 70 per cent.; while those of Atriplex 

 patulum withstood 50 per cent, sea water. Graves found that the root 

 hairs of Ruppia maritima could stand a 105 per cent, sea water with 

 occasionally very slight plasmolysis, while with 110 per cent, sea water 

 it was rather slow, but finally distinct. He also used solutions of 2.5, 

 3 and 5 per cent, sodium chloride with the following results. In the 

 2.5 per cent, solution, the leaves of Ruppia maritima did not plas- 

 molyze; in the 3 per cent, solution they plasmolyzed in 4-5 minutes; 

 in 5 per cent, solution in about 1 minute. Ordinary ocean water con- 

 tains about 3.5 per cent, of salts, and it would seem, therefore, on 

 a priori grounds, that the water of New Haven harbor does not contain 

 as much salts as the 3 per cent, quantity of sodium chloride in the 

 above experiment. It shows, however, that the adaptation of halo- 

 phytic plants is within a narrow limit of salinity, and if the salinity

of the water varies within wider limits such plants are checked in their 

 growth or completely exterminated. This was emphasized in our 

 discussion of the salt marsh vegetation found in Upper Wreck Pond, 

 and it accounts for the limitation of fresh water species when the water 

 in which they grow reaches a certain degree of salinity. 



The study of the salt marshes, salt ponds and fresh water lakes of 

 northern coastal New Jersey has developed many features of phyto- 

 geographic importance. The origin of the lakes and ponds, it has been 

 proved, is due to the advance of sand dunes across the outlet of various 

 streams that have their rise some distance inland. Most of the larger 

 streams, that have kept open their outlets to the sea, are lined for 

 some distance from the ocean by salt marsh vegetation, which shows a 

 number of characteristic plants in pure association. As the sand bar 

 encroached upon the outlets of the streams the water became somewhat 

 brackish, and the conditions favorable to the salt marsh species became 

 more precarious, one species at a time disappearing with the decrease 

 of water saltiness. Finally, near the heads of several of the bays, and 

 also in several of the smaller ponds, the water becomes more and 

 more fresh, and we find a replacement of salt marsh plants by those 

 accustomed to grow in or near fresh water streams. Similarly salt 

 ponds have by a slow process of change been converted into fresh 

 water lakes, and the vegetation has changed accordingly with the 

 altered physiographic conditions. Instead of the vegetation of the 

 New Jersey coast remaining of a fixed type, we can trace, by a com- 

 parison of the several plant formations in various conditions of develop- 

 ment, the stages through which the vegetation has passed in reaching 

 its present aspect, and the age of these different associations of plants 

 can be determined by comparing the marsh areas given on the present 

 survey maps with those indicated on the older survey maps of the 

 inlets made at various times in the past by engineers for harbor 

 improvement. 16 The development has been a progressive one, and 

 all in a certain direction from an original salt marsh vegetation to a 

 fresh water and dry land flora. If at any time in this orderly sequence 

 the sea should break through the barrier of sand, or remove it by the 

 ordinary physiographic processes which are constantly active in the 

 region, then there is a reversal of the orderly progression of one type 



16 See for this purpose the illustrated paper by Prof. Lewis M. Haupt, on 

 "Changes along the New Jersey Coast," Annual Report State Geologist of New 

 Jersey, 1905: 27-95; 1907: 72-81, and for methods of using similar survey maps 

 see Otto E. Jennings, "A Botanical Survey of Presque Isle, Pa.," Annals of the 

 Carnegie Museum, V: 294-305 et seq. 




400 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Aug. , 



of plant formation to another and the original salt marsh conditions 

 are restored. This reversal may be sudden, if the sand barrier is 

 destroyed in a single storm, or it may be gradual, if by a shifting of 

 the ocean currents the sand is removed slowly away from the outlet 

 of the stream or lake, as has happened within the past two years at 

 the mouth of Shark River, which was a few years ago almost closed from 

 the sea, and closed completely by a southeast storm on July 23, 1909. 



In the sudden reversal by a heavy storm, all of the fresh water plant 

 formations would be destroyed and the shore line would be made barren 

 for a number of years, until by the usual methods of plant dispersal 

 and invasion the salt marsh plants again take possession of the river 

 banks, or line the shores of the bays and estuaries that may have been 

 formed. If by the second method the reversal has taken place, then 

 by the water becoming gradually brackish and finally salt, the fresh 

 water plants will slowly lose their hold as the soil which they have 

 occupied is invaded by the typic salt marsh plants. 



Man, however, has worked greater changes in the original vegetation 

 of northern coastal New Jersey than all of the agencies previously 

 outlined have produced. He has cut down the forests, spanned the 

 rivers with bridges so as to disturb their natural flow, built railroads 

 and wagon roads, constructed jetties and stone revetments, filled in 

 ponds and ditches, spread kerosene over marshes to kill mosquitoes, 

 and altered the drainage areas until in some places no trace of the 

 original vegetation is left.

ON THE TRUE STATUS OF THE GENUS CACOPOIDES. 



BY THOMAS BARBOUR. 



In August, 1907, a considerable collection of reptiles and amphibians 

 was purchased from Mr. Alan Owston, of Yokohama, Japan. Most of 

 the specimens were from the island of Formosa, from Hainan and from 

 various localities in the Riu Kiu archipelago. A few specimens, how- 

 ever, were from the Chinese mainland, some from Sian, capital of the 

 province of Shensi, while others were from Antung in Manchuria. 

 Among the specimens from this last locality was a peculiar "digger 

 toad" upon which I founded the genus Cacopoides. Dr. Stejneger, 

 about the time of the description, rather doubted the probability of the 

 specimen having come from Manchuria. I am assured, however, that 

 the locality is correct by Mr. Owston, and from the specimens which 

 were received with the toad there seems every reason to believe that 

 it is authentic. Two typical Northern species of frogs, to wit, Rana 

 nigromaculata and Rana amurensis, as well as a specimen of Amy da 

 schlegelii, came in the same jar with Cacopoides. In October, 1908, 

 the writer happened to be in London for a few days, en route to Brazil. 

 The opportunity was taken to discuss the new genus with Dr. Boulen- 

 ger at the British Museum. He had not at that time received a copy 

 of the paper in which Cacopoides was described. From my verbal 

 description it seemed very probable that the new genus was identical 

 with Boulenger's Kaloula verrucosa. This species resembles the other 

 closely in outward appearance and in coloration, and moreover had 

 been reported recently by Wolterstorff from the neighborhood of 

 Tsingtau in Shantung. 



The finding of an amphibian of the family Engystomatidae as far 

 north as the province of Shantung immediately makes it evident that 

 there was no particular reason to doubt the accuracy of the locality of 

 Cacopoides borealis, which I must confess I did at first. 



Now, thanks to the kindness of Dr. Boulenger, I have two specimens 

 of Kaloula verrucosa from authentic topotype material taken at Yun- 

 nan-fu, as well as a third specimen obtained by purchase and collected 

 there also by Mr. John Graham, the discoverer of the species. So that 

 it becomes possible to present a comparison of this species with the 

 one from Manchuria.

402 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



Unfortunately, the case was somewhat complicated by a short note 

 which I mailed from Europe and published in the Proceedings of the 

 Biological Society of Washington (Vol. XXII, April 17, 1909, p. 89). 

 This note read as follows: 



"A correction is to be made in the case of Cacopoioles borealis Bar- 

 bour, described as the type of a new genus and species in a paper on 

 'Some New Reptiles and Amphibians' (Bull. Mus. Corny. Zool., Vol. 

 50, No. 12, p. 321, April, 1908). It appears that this must now be 

 considered identical with Callula verrucosa Boulenger, though consider- 

 ably variant from the type of that species and vastly removed from it 

 in range. Boulenger's specimen came from Yunnan, while that on 

 which the supposed new species was based was collected at Antung, 

 Manchuria." 



Drawings have been prepared to show not only the difference in 

 outward appearance between the two species but the shapes of the 

 terminal phalanges, the sacral diapophyses, the sterna, and the inter- 

 iors of the mouth cavities. In some cases drawings illustrate the form 

 of the same structures in the allied genus Cacopus. A comparison of 

 these figures will serve to show graphically and more satisfactorily the 

 differences than would a lengthy verbal description. 



For the sake of record the original description is appended herewith 

 from the Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology (Vol. LI, No. 

 12, April, 1908, p. 321 ) : 



Cacopoides gen. nov. 



An engystomatid related to Cacopus. The precoracoids are wanting, 

 the coracoids meet each other on the median line, without an inter- 

 calated cartilage; the large metasternal cartilage, instead of being 

 connected to the coracoids by an isthmus, much more narrow than the 

 metasternum itself, is closely adpressed to the coracoidal symphysis. 

 This may be made more clear by the appended drawings. Choanal 

 small, with valve-like flaps ; dermal ridges behind the choanae converg- 

 ing posteriorly and each with an enlarged papilla near the median line; 

 another long ridge in front of the oesophagus which is sharply curved 

 anteriorly near the median line. Tympanum hidden. Fingers free, 

 toes webbed at base, tips not dilated. Sacral diapophyses rather 

 strongly dilated. 



Cacopoides borealis sp. nov. 



Habit very stout. Head small ; snout rounded ; no canthus rostralis ; 

 snout about as long as orbital diameter; interorbital space more than 

 twice the diameter of the upper eyelid. Fingers moderate, first shorter 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 403 



than second; toes moderate, webbed at base; no subarticular tubercles; 

 two metatarsal tubercles, the inner strong and shovel-like, the outer 

 weak. Hind limb short. Skin smooth, the dorsal surface with scat- 

 tered minute pits. Color dark brown-olive above; beneath dusky, 

 marbled with brown. A subgular vocal sac is present. 



A re-examination of the type has not rendered it necessary to make 

 any very radical change in the diagnosis as it was originally published. 

 A careful examination shows, however, that there is a very small bit 

 of intercalated cartilage at the symphysis of the coracoids. 



There remains, however, a considerable number of differences from 

 Kaloula, which seem well worth pointing out. In the first place, the 

 presence of valves in the choanae serves to distinguish the interior of 

 the mouth at once from that in Kaloula and suggests a possible rela- 

 tionship with Cacopus. In this genus, however, though valves are 

 present in the internal nares, nevertheless the great size of the openings 

 and the characteristic reduction of the palatal projections to two 

 small bony points serve to distinguish this Indian genus at once from 

 ours. The diagrams of the three sterna show that in shape the sternum 

 of Cacopoides is more or less intermediate in form between those of the 

 other two genera. As regards the shape of the terminal phalanges it 

 will be seen that here again the form is intermediate between those of 

 K. verrucosa and Cacopus globulosus. For the sake of comparison, 

 drawings have been made to show the phalanges in Kaloula pulchra 

 and K . baleata. These call attention to the extreme variation which may 

 take place in the shape of these bones within a single genus. In the 

 first specimen which Boulenger received, and in many of the subsequent 

 specimens, the verrucose condition of the skin of the dorsum led to 

 his giving the name he did to the Yunnan species. In the type of 

 Cacopoides, however, the skin presents a finely pitted appearance, in 

 sharp distinction to the common condition in the species previously 

 mentioned. The reduction of size of the hind limb, the relatively 

 large size of the mouth opening, the difference in coloring which is 

 readily seen from a glance at the drawings, as well as the shape and 

 size of the sacrum and urostyle, serve at once to show the complete 

 distinction of the new genus. The type of Cacopoides borealis in actual 

 size is somewhat larger than the largest of the three specimens of 

 Kaloula verrucosa. Yet the urostyle is shorter and the sacrum nar- 

 rower and rather more dilated than in the other species. 



The discovery of this toad in Manchuria is as remarkable as unex- 

 pected when we think of the distribution of the Engystomatidae in 

 eastern Asia. The probability that, owing to the habits of these 




404 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



creatures they may exist in a locality comparatively well explored 

 zoologically without their presence being suspected until they are 

 found by the merest accident, renders it quite impossible to draw any 

 conclusions regarding the exact relationships and dispersal of these 

 forms. 



For the sake of comparison, descriptions of the genera Cacopus and 

 Kaloula are added hereto, as well as Boulenger's original description of 

 Kaloula verrucosa : — 



Cacopus Gthr. 



Pupil erect. Tongue oval, entire and free behind. Choanae very 

 large, with a dermal movable flap, which can close the nostril; two 

 small bony prominences close together, between and on a level with the 

 hinder edge of the choanae ; a small papilla on the hind margin of each 

 choana; a narrow r denticulated dermal ridge across the sphenoidal 

 region ; another, very broad, in the front of the oesophagus. Tympanum 

 hidden or very indistinct. Fingers free; toes webbed at the base, the 

 tips not dilated. Outer metatarsals united. Precoracoids none; 

 sternum a large cartilaginous plate. Diapophyses of sacral vertebra 

 rather strongly dilated. Terminal phalanges simple. 



India. (Boulenger, Cat, Batr. Sal, 1882, p. 174.)

 den. Fingers free, toes more or less w T ebbed (exceptionally free), the 

 tips more or less dilated. Outer metatarsals united. No precoracoids; 

 no omosternum ; sternum cartilaginous. Diapophyses of sacral ver- 

 tebra moderately dilated. Terminal phalanges triangular or T-shaped. 



East Indies. (Boulenger, I, c, p. 167.) 



Kaloula verrucosa Blgr.

 space as broad as the upper eyelid. Fingers slender, with slightly 

 swollen tips, first a little shorter than second; toes moderate, nearly 

 half-webbed, the tips blunt, not swollen, fifth considerably shorter than 

 third; subarticular tubercles well developed; metatarsal tubercles 

 two, oval, compressed, the inner very large. The tibiotarsal articu- 

 lation reaches the shoulder or between the shoulder and the eye

Type, No. 36,638, A. N. S. P. Corson's Inlet, Cape May County, 

 New Jersey. April 11, 1909. Dr. R. J. Phillips. 



This interesting fish was picked up on the ocean beach after a storm, 

 with a number of other small fishes, such as Raja erinacea, Syngnathus 

 fuscus, Hippocampus hudsonius, Centropristis striatus, Prionotus 

 evolans strigatus, Gobiosoma bosci, Opsanus tau and Lophius piscatorius. 

 Dr. Phillips noted the color of the Atopichthys as ivory-white when 

 first found and measuring 3f inches in length, so that it has shrunk 

 considerably after being placed in alcohol. It is most closely related 

 to Leptocephalus amphioxus Eigenmann and Kennedy, but differs at 

 once in having the area of its greatest depth extending well behind the 

 middle of the length of the body, and therefore with an extremely 

 elongated ovoid contour. It agrees, however, in the chromatophores 

 and posterior vent, though there are no branchiostegal chromato- 

 phores indicated for L. amphioxus. Further it differs from the latter 

 in fewer trunk myomeres, protruding mandible, widely separated 

 nostrils, and more numerous ventral chromatophores. Possibly it 

 may be the young of some genus like Uropterygius? 



(Named for Dr. Richard J. Phillips, of Philadelphia, who collected 

 the type.) 



Notes on some New Jersey Fishes. — Dr. R. J. Phillips secured 

 a number of interesting fishes at Corson's Inlet during the past sea- 

 son, among them a fine example of Hemitripterus americanus on April 

 25th, on May 10th a fine adult example of Pomolobus mediocris with 

 a small blue Petromyzon marinus attached, and on March 21st six 

 small Fundulus lucice. On May 20th he secured, besides an interesting 

 young P. mediocris, Anchovia, mitchilli, Lucania parva, Syngnathus 

 fuscus, young Poronotus triacanthus and Phycis regius in the bait- 

 net. A few specimens of Menticirrhus americanus were taken there 

 during the past summer, as well as at Somers' Point, and early in No- 

 vember of 1908 several of Squalus acanthias and a large Raja la3vis 

 were taken at Corson's. Mr. W. J . Fox secured a fine Zoarces anguillaris 

 taken March 14, 1909, and noted three Pollachius virens on April 4th 

 at Sea Isle City. An Alopias vulpes, 15^ feet long, was taken at Cape 

 May Point on June 18th, according to Mr. H. W. Hand. During the 

 past month the latter also noted Carcharias littoralis, Cynais canis and 

 Sphyrna zygana about Cape May, and found Gambusia gracilis appar- 

 ently more abundant in Teal's Branch than when first discovered in 

 1907. On July 14th I received a Raja eglanteria and four Dasyatis

centroura from off Green Creek in Delaware Bay. Mr. Fox is informed 

 that two large Tarpon atlanticus were reported from the pounds at Sea 

 Isle City about 1901 or 1902. Mr. I. N. DeHaven reported Tarpon atlan- 

 ticus taken at Chadwick in 1907, and Trichuirus lepturus later. Perhaps 

 the most interesting fish captured in New Jersey waters this season was 

 a fine large example of Rhinoptera bonasus taken on September 11th in 

 the bay at Ocean City, and secured for the Academy by Mr. David 

 McCadden. No definite New Jersey record has ever been given since 

 LeSueur described it from Egg Harbor in 1817 in the Journal of the 

 Academy. Dr. Phillips has kindly furnished me with a drawing and 

 detailed description of a young Garrupa nigrita taken at Corson's Inlet 

 on September 2d, which is the first record for this fish in New Jersey 

 waters.

AN ORTHOPTEROLOGICAL RECONNOISSANCE OF THE SOUTHWESTERN 

 UNITED STATES. PART III: CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA. 



BY JAMES A. G. REHN AND MORGAN HEBARD. 



The first and second portions of the results of this examination 

 of the southwestern United States, treating of Arizona, New Mexico and 

 western Texas material, have already been published in these Pro- 

 ceedings. 1 The present is the final one of the series, bringing to a 

 close the study of the collections made in 1907. 



The material treated in this paper was almost wholly collected by 

 the junior author, although several small but interesting lots taken 

 by Dr. Joseph Grinnell and Mr. Fordyce Grinnell, Jr., have added 

 materially to the interest of the work. The collections made by these 

 gentlemen were very kindly given by them to the Academy. Mr. 

 Otho Poling, of Quincy, Illinois, whose assistance was acknowledged 

 in the previous papers, aided in securing a good portion of the material 

 taken in the Los Angeles region (Alamitos Bay, Miramar, Pasadena, 

 Echo Mountain and Mt. Lowe), while collections made by him in late 

 August near Los Angeles, at Altadena and on Mt. Lowe contain much 

 of interest. 



The number of species examined and treated in this report is one 

 hundred and ten, of which six species and two subspecies prove to 

 be new, while the specimens number one thousand eight hundred 

 and seventy. 



Localities. 



Indio, Riverside County, California. Altitude, 26 feet below sea- 

 level; July 29, 1907. Orthoptera were found plentiful near the 

 town on the sun-baked plain, upon which grew a high dense growth of 

 plants, and also in small irrigated spots near the railroad station. 

 The intense heat made collecting rather difficult. 



AUv itos Bay, Los Angeles County, California . July 31. Near the 

 nceai i on the loose sand, upon which typical beach vegetation 



is - ■ . r some few species of Orthoptera were found. In a few 

 ip spots in this situation several specimens of the genus 

 ere taken.

410 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



Miramar, Los Angeles County, California. July 31. In this locality 

 a field of dry trampled grass near the shore proved the most produc- 

 tive location. On the whole collecting near the shore was not nearly 

 as good as it was farther inland near the hills. 



Pasadena, Los Angeles County, California. Altitude, 824 feet; 

 August 1. A good lot of material was secured in the Arroyo Seco, 

 where in the heavy brush and cactus and also beside the stream a 

 number of interesting species were encountered. Nearby in culti- 

 vated ground collecting was also productive. On the nearer slopes 

 of the San Rafael Hills quite a different and pearly as interesting 

 a series of Orthoptera was taken. These hills were covered with low 

 dry grasses, with frequent dense tangles of low bushes between them. 

 This vegetation and the steepness of the slopes made collecting much 

 more difficult than in the Arroyo Seco. 



Between Altadena and Rubio a very few specimens were taken 

 on August 8, among low bushes. 



Echo Mountain, San Gabriel Range, Los Angeles County, California. 

 Altitude, 2,700-3,500 feet; August 8. On the steep slopes covered 

 with dense but low bushes a few interesting specimens were taken in 

 a short time. 



Ml. Lowe, San Gabriel Range, Los Angeles County, California. Alti- 

 tude, 5,200-5,600 feet; August 8. Between Alpine and the summit 

 the steep mountain side is clothed with heavy shrubs and low oaks, 

 while the ravines in places are filled with tall trees. On the mountain 

 side collecting was most productive and interesting, but in the ravines 

 only a few Melanopli were found. 



Between Echo and Alpine, altitude 4,000-4,800 feet, the mountain 

 slopes proved splendid collecting places, especially where there was an 

 occasional small pocket or basin. In one of these nearly level areas 

 Napaia gracilis, Dracotettix californicus and other very interesting 

 species were found. The mountain sides are in the majority of places 

 clothed with manzanita and other low bushes. 



Santa Catalina Island, Los Angeles County, California. August 3-7. 

 On Catalina Island the slopes of the hills about Avalon, which are 

 covered with low bushes and weeds and an occasional thick clim 

 of stunted oaks, proved quite unproductive. On the golf c r 

 farther up in the Avalon Valley, certain common species were al- 

 and toward dusk several species of Locustids and crickets 

 in some cultivated bushes about the club house and ab'

1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 411 



Collecting at Catalina was much like that among the low hills 

 along the coast and not nearly as good as among the San Gabriel 

 foothills. 



Cottonwood, San Bernardino County, California. Altitude, 2,274 

 feet; September 9. On the desert clothed with greasewood and other 

 plants of the Mohavan region collecting was very productive, especially 

 at dusk when a number of interesting things were taken. The desert 

 is here more or less rolling and the spot is ideal for collecting in a dry 

 region. Nearby along the border of the Mohave River, in tall weeds 

 and grassy ground vhich had been inundated but was at the time 

 parched, a number of interesting species were found. On the train at 

 night species of Homceogamia and Stagmomantis were taken, two of 

 which are new. On the whole, this was the most interesting desert 

 situation in which collecting was done during this trip. 



Kelso, San Bernardino County, California. Altitude, 2,118 feet; 

 August 12. In this the most extremely arid desert area encountered, 

 covered only with a scattered growth of greasewood and a very few 

 low desert plants, quite a few specimens were taken. North from the 

 station, among the volcanic foothills of the North Range of the 

 Providence Mountains, a very few specimens were captured, but these 

 were the most interesting captures made at this point. Pcecilotettix 

 sanguineus was seen but not taken. Kelso is situated seven miles 

 from the huge shifting sand hills called the Devil's Playground, and near 

 it is a dry soda lake. A visit to that area would doubtless have 

 proved interesting, but time was not available. 



Cima, San Bernardino County, California. Altitude, 4,192 feet; 

 August 12. Cima is situated on a high plateau covered with tall 

 tree yuccas. The low vegetation was scant and consisted of a very few 

 greasewood bushes and other species of desert shrubs. In some nearby 

 low hills covered with essentially the same vegetation long search 

 failed to disclose any species of special interest. In a growth of 

 tumble-weed beside the railroad all the specimens of Ageneotettix 

 australis and Cordillacris apache were taken. 



Lyons, San Bernardino County, California. Altitude, 2,850 feet; 

 August 11. In an area of loose sand with scattered tufts of dry 

 grass Heliastus minimus alone was found. The desert here was covered 

 with fragments of volcanic rock, among which greasewood and a very 

 few other desert plants grew and the entire country had a decidedly 

 baked appearance. In this area a number of very valuable captures 

 were made, although it was insufferably hot, much more so than 

 at Yuma. 




412 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



Bird Spring Mountains, McCullough Range, Lincoln County, 

 Nevada. Altitude, 2,900-3,000 feet; August 11. On the slopes up 

 to the foothills of these mountains the character of country and 

 vegetation was much the same as about Lyons, California, nearby, 

 except that the volcanic fragments were here much more abundant. 

 Tytthotyle maculata was found here also, and the single specimen of 

 Drymadusa arizonensis taken on this trip was found just where the 

 slopes reached the plain. 



Las Vegas, Lincoln County, Nevada. Altitude, 2,050 feet; August 

 9, 10. Most of the material from this locality was taken in the only 

 green place for many miles around, along the small stream which springs 

 out of the desert to the north of Las Vegas. A good series was also 

 captured on the surrounding desert, which differed from the usual 

 desert of the Southwest in that there was no greasewood and hardly 

 any mesquite to be found. In some spots this desert was excessively 

 parched and barren. Las Vegas, offering both desert and damp 

 land collecting, was more productive than the majority of places in this 

 character of country. 



El Toro, Orange County, California. August 20. Collecting was found 

 to be unproductive in the rolling grain fields about the village, which 

 were very dusty and warm at this season. 



Tia Juana, San Diego County, California. August 16. The low 

 hills, covered with scant vegetation, and a swampy section near the 

 Mexican boundary line were examined. 



Coronado Beach, San Diego County, California. August 14, 15 and 

 16. Salt marsh, strand and weed field situations were examined at 

 this locality and at South Coronado Beach. 



Raymond, Madera County, California. Altitude, 940 feet; Sep- 

 tember 3. In a hillside stubble field near the village Orthoptera was 

 found in quantities. The Decticid Clinopleura minuta was particu- 

 larly abundant. The town is not as far out in the valley as Merced, 

 and collecting between this place and Miami would without doubt 

 have proved extremely productive had more time been available. 



Merced, Merced County, California. Altitude, 173 feet; August 

 30. All of the Orthoptera captured at Merced were taken in a very 

 dry stubble field near the railroad station. 



Summit House, Madera County, California. Altitude, 2,200 feet; 

 September 3. In this vicinity specimens of interest were taken on 

 a hillside covered with a scattering growth of oaks. The undergrowth 

 here consisted of a thick mat of short dry yellow grasses interspersed 

 with very low tar weed. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 413 



Miami, Mariposa County, California. Altitude, 4,200 feet; Sep- 

 tember 3. A few specimens were taken on a hillside in a conifer 

 forest. 



Ahwahnee, Madera County, California. Altitude, 3,700 feet; 

 September 3. In a large patch of tar weed and other high plants collect- 

 ing was found to be extremely productive, and several species were found 

 which had not been met with in the higher parts of the Sierras. Had 

 more time been available there is but little doubt that a very interest- 

 ing series could have been taken. This was by far the best locality 

 for collecting between Wawona and Raymond. 



From the Yosemite Valley to the Mariposa Sequoia grove the roads 

 are bordered by great open conifer forests, in which Trimerotropis 

 fallax and Trimerotropis cwruleipes were found almost invariably 

 plentiful. In this region collecting was done at Wawona, altitude 

 4,000 feet, September 1; at Mariposa Grove, altitude 7,000 feet, 

 September 2; at Grouse Creek, altitude 6,000 feet, September 1, and 

 at Eight Mile Camp, altitude 5,000 feet, September 1. All of these 

 localities were much the same for collecting. 



Sentinel, Yosemite Valley, Yosemite National Park, California. 

 Altitude, 4,000 feet; August 31-September 1. In the heavy grass 

 near the hotel Melanopli were found in small numbers, while on the 

 opposite side of the Merced River many more were taken in a similar 

 location. In the pine woods of the valley bottom several species of 

 Trimerotropis were taken, and in one clearing dotted with low bushes, 

 in the direction of the Yosemite Falls, a series of Trimerotropis koebelei 

 was taken. At a higher elevation among the conifers growing on the 

 walls of the valley Aglaothorax sierranus was found, as well as the ever 

 present Trimerotropis fallax and Trimerotropis cceruleipes, and on the 

 steep upper ledges of bare rock near the upper part of the valley wall 

 Circotettix shastanus was discovered. 



El Portal, Mariposa County, California. Altitude, about 3,200 feet; 

 August 30. This is the terminus of the railroad in the gorge of the 

 Merced, near the entrance of the Yosemite National Park. At this 

 point the rather steep sides of the gorge are clothed with a heavy 

 forest of oaks and other deciduous trees mingled with some few conifers. 

 Few but interesting specimens were taken in the undergrowth, par- 

 ticularly Melanoplus ablutus and Cyrtophyllicus chlorum. A longer 

 stay would have proved very productive. 



Mill Valley, Marin County, California. Altitude, 300 feet; August 

 23. A few specimens of the genus Conocephalus were taken among 

 weeds growing in the street ditches. Just outside of the town on the 




414 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



grassy slopes, which ascend farther back to Mt. Tamalpais, several very 

 interesting species of Melanoplus were found among numerous more 

 common Orthoptera. The region was dry and dusty and much like 

 the other low dry grass-covered hills of the coast. 



Mt. Tamalpais, Marin County, California. Altitude, 1,500-2,500 

 feet; August 23. On the summit but little Orthoptera was to be 

 found among the manzanita and other low shrubbery. A fog con- 

 tinually driving across the mountain top during my stay no doubt 

 prevented a larger number being taken. Near the upper level of 

 the timber a colony of Neduba was found in a grassy ravine with 

 a scattered growth of pines, oaks and other trees. From this point 

 downward, collecting among the grasses and herbs beside the rail- 

 road track was rather productive, but the mountain ridges covered with 

 manzanita bushes and low herbs revealed Orthoptera in numbers, 

 among which were some very interesting species. The slopes were 

 usually steep, and collecting seemed both more convenient and more 

 productive on the ridges and occasional small level spots. Just below 

 the central portion of this manzanita-covered zone proved the most 

 productive altitude. 



The material collected by Dr. Joseph Grinnell was all taken during 

 a biological survey of the San Bernardino Mountains, 2 the greater 

 proportion of the specimens being taken on the South Fork of the 

 Santa Ana River. The specimens given by Mr. Fordyce Grinnell, Jr., 

 were secured at several localities in the San Jacinto Mountains, 

 and their eastern spur the Santa Rosa Mountains, on Mt. Wilson, San 

 Gabriel Mountains and at Pasadena. The material from the San 

 Bernardino, San Jacinto and Santa Rosa ranges was of exceptional 

 interest, as little or nothing was known of them orthopterologically. 

 The latter is also true of the material taken by Hebard in the Bird 

 Spring Mountains, at Cima, in the North Range of the Providence 

 Mountains and at Las Vegas, Nevada.

 Homoeogamia erratica Kehn. 



A single male of this species was taken September 9 at Cottonwood 

 on board a train, to which it had been attracted by the lights. The 

 specimen is paler than a number of Arizona individuals, having 

 practically no markings except an arcuate reddish line meso-caudad 

 on the pronotum. 



This is the first record of the species from California. 



Homoeogamia subdiaphana mohavensis a. subsp. 



Four males of an extremely pale form of H. subdiaphana, Scudder, 

 previously known only from several localities in New Mexico, were 

 taken at Cottonwood, September 9, under similar conditions to the in- 

 dividual of H. erratica recorded above. 



These specimens are very pale cream-buff in base color, the tegminal 

 veins pencilled with burnt umber, those of the anal area, which are 

 strongly lined in the typical form, being hardly more defined than 

 those of the proximal portion of the discoidal area. The pronotum is 

 clouded caudad with ochraceous, particularly on the paired lateral 

 and single caudal areas which are dragon's blood red to bay in the 

 typical form. 



Two forms of pronotum are noticed in the seriesTof H. subdiaphana 

 and H. s. mohavensis, one with the cephalic margin distinctly obtuse 

 angulate, the other with the same portion broadly arcuate.

Allied to S. fraterna, mon\ana and venusta Saussure and Zehntner 

 and gracilipes Rehn. From fraterna it differs in the slenderer prono- 

 tum, particularly the shaft, more prominent eyes, differently colored 

 wings in both sexes and longer pronotum and cephalic femora and 

 shorter tegmina in the male; from montana in the much smaller size, 

 proportionately longer and slenderer pronotum and much broader 

 head and differently colored wings ; from venusta in the more truncate 

 and less arcuate occiput, the less pyriform eyes when viewed from. the 

 side, the absence of black markings from the internal face of the 

 cephalic femora in the male, in the stigma being distinctly colored 

 as in the female; from gracilipes in the shorter pronotum with the 

 supra-coxal region more dilated and in the shorter limbs, the cephalic 

 femora being much broader and heavier. 



The species is in no way related to S. heterogamia Saussure and 

 Zehntner, and differs from S. Carolina in the different proportions of 

 the head and pronotum, the coriaceous costal field of the tegmina of 

 the male and in the stigma not being distinctively colored in the same 

 sex; from S. limbata it differs in the smaller size, proportionately 

 broader head, more prominent eyes, slighter pronotum (particularly 

 in the female) and the shorter and narrower tegmina of the female. 



Form moderately slender; size medium. Head quite broad, the 

 depth contained one and one-half ( 9 ) to one and two-thirds (<J*) times 

 in the width; occipital outline nearly straight, not arcuate; facial 

 scutellum with the greatest depth (median) contained slightly more 

 than twice in the width, dorsal margin obtuse-angulate, very slightly 

 fissate at the angle in the male, the lateral portions of the angle slightly 

 arcuate-emarginate ventrad of the insertion of the antennse; ocelli

 separated, those of the female quite small compared with the large 

 jewel-like ocelli of the male; eyes large, 

 quite prominent, very broad elliptical 

 in shape when seen from the side, not 

 elevated dorsad of the occipital line; 

 antennae setaceous in both sexes, slend- 

 erer and shorter in the female than in 

 the male. Pronotum slightly longer 

 than twice the width of the head, the 

 supra-coxal width contained four (cT) 

 or three and a half ( 9 ) times in the 

 length of the pronotum; shaft consid- 

 erably compressed mesad, the whole 

 shaft carinate, the expansion and collar 

 pyriform, broadly ( 9 ) or narrowly (c?) 

 so, margins of the male unarmed, rather 

 strongly denticulate cephalad in the 

 female, the teeth becoming weaker 

 caudad until absent from the caudal 

 portion. Tegmina of the male very 

 slightly exceeding the apex of the abdo- 

 men, hyaline with the rather narrow 

 costal field opaque and sub-coriaceous; 

 tegmina of the female about equal to 

 the pronotum in length and reaching 

 about to the middle of the abdomen ; 

 costal margin considerably arcuate prox- 

 imad; the costal field slightly more 

 than a fourth the width of the whole

 longitudinal. Wings hardly exceeding 

 the tips of the tegmina. Supra-anal 

 plate of the male transverse, the apical 

 margin regularly but not very greatly 

 arcuate; subgenital plate of the male 

 moderately produced, the apical margin very narrowly and angularly 

 emarginate; cerci slightly exceeding the apex of the subgenital plate, 

 tapering, the joints elongate sub-moniliform ; supra-anal plate of 

 the female strongly transverse, the margin rotundato-angulate ; sub-

An additional paratypic male has been examined, as well as a male 

 from Kelso (VIII, 12; attracted to light), a female from North Range, 

 Providence Mountains (VIII, 12), and one from Pasadena (F. Grinnell, 

 Jr. ; Coll. A. N. S. Phila.). There is a slight amount of variation in size 

 and considerable in color. The extra Cottonwood male is similar 

 to the type, but the Kelso individual of that sex is red-brown with the 

 limbs annulate with buffy and the costal half of the tegmina sprinkled

with small ashy blotches. The Providence Mountains female is 

 similar to the type but paler, inclining toward emerald green, with the 

 brownish on the pronotum reduced. 4 The Pasadena individual is 

 in a brownish phase corresponding to that of the Kelso male, the 

 limbs being more (particularly the cephalic) or less annulate with 

 buffy, the tegmina entirely sprinkled with small creamy-white macu- 

 lations and the stigma marked. 



At Cottonwood all the specimens were attracted to the lights of 

 the train, the individual taken at Kelso having been captured in a 

 similar manner, while in the North Range of the Providence Mountains 

 the species was taken on green desert weeds. 



PHASMIDiE. 

 Parabacillus coloradus (Scudder). 



A broken specimen of this species, taken at Pasadena, California, 

 by Fordyce Grinnell, Jr., has been examined. The right cephalic 

 limb is aborted, the whole regenerated leg being but little longer than 

 the head. The only previous exact Californian record of the species 

 is of its occurrence at Elsinore, Riverside County. 



ACRIDIDJE. 

 Aorydium granulatum Kirby. 



A single adult male and three nymphs of this northern species were 

 taken in tall grass in meadow land at Sentinel, Yosemite National 

 Park, August 31. When compared with material from Michigan the 

 adult specimen is found to be inseparable. This is the first record 

 of the species from California. 

 Paratettix toltecus (Saussure). 



A series of seven males and nine females of this species were taken 

 at Las Vegas, August 10, in a giassy well-watered strip along a stream. 

 A single female was also taken at Cottonwood, September 9, 

 on dry grassy ground along the course of the Mohave River. These 

 specimens are quite uniform in size, the males of course smaller than 

 the females, while the color varies from a blackish-brown base color 

 to one of deep dull maroon-red; the paired blackish triangles placed 

 caudad of the greatest width of the pronotum are present more or les s 

 distinctly on all but one of the specimens. This one, a male, has a 

 broad medio-longitudinal bar of dull ochraceous present from the 

 fastigium to the apex of the pronotum, this margined laterad at the 

 greatest width with blackish-brown. 



4 This color is probably due to discoloration in drying. 




420 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



This is the first record of the species from Nevada and the second 

 with exact data from California, Riley having recorded it from Pana- 

 mint Valley, Inyo County. 

 Morsea oalifornica Scudder. 



This very interesting Eumastacid was found on manzanita bushes 

 (Arctostaphylos tomentosa), at elevations of from 5,200 feet to 5,600 feet 

 on Mt. Lowe, August 8, where a series of two presumably adult males, 

 three females and six immature specimens was taken. A single 

 female was also taken at an elevation of 3,200 feet on Echo Mountain, 

 while a male from 5,000 feet on Mt. Wilson, taken September 15, by 

 Fordyce Grinnell, Jr., is also before us. 



From the original measurement given by Scudder, "length of the 



body and of the hind femora .... 9 mm.," it would appear 



that the types are immature, as a pair from Mt. Lowe, which we judge 



to be adults, measure as follows: 



& 9 



Length of body, 12 mm. 16.5 mm. 



Length of pronotum, 2.2 " 2.7 " 



Length of caudal femur, 10 " 11 " 



There is little variation in size in the adult specimens, the Echo 

 Mountain female, however, being slightly smaller than the others of 

 that sex. 



In color the adults show little variation, the general tone of the 

 female being dull blackish brown dusted with grayish with the 

 limbs irregularly annulate with very dull grayish, except the caudal 

 tibiae which are mottled; the general color of the males is usually 

 more warm brown on the dorsum, with a narrow median dark-brown 

 line on the pronotum and much broader, poorly defined postocular 

 bars of the same color, the limbs annulate as in the females, and in 

 two of the specimens the whole surface is much dusted with hoary. 

 The postocular bars of the male are sometimes continued on the 

 sides of the abdomen, and in the Echo Mountain female indications 

 of these bars are also present. A pale edging to the ventral margin 

 of the lateral lobes of the pronotum is present more or less distinctly 

 and of varying width in a number of the adults. The immature speci- 

 mens are much more uniformly red-brown than the adults, although 

 one, a female, has the coloration of adults of that sex. 



No traces of tegmina or wings are apparent. 



These insects were usually to be found perched on the upper portions 

 of the manzanita bushes. They were found to be very active with 

 saltatorial powers much developed, added to which their small size 




1909.J NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 421 



would have made them very difficult to capture, had they not 

 almost invariably alighted in an exposed position. As they were 

 constantly alert, the only successful way to capture them was by a 

 quick sweep of the net. The types of the species came from the Cahon 

 Pass and Mt. Wilson. 



Morsea californica tamalpaisensis n. subsp. 



Types : cT and 9 ; Mt. Tamalpais, Marin County, California. 

 August 23, 1907. [Hebard Collection.] 



A series of thirteen adult males, two females and four nymphs of 

 a small form of M. californica were taken on the slopes of Mt. Tamal- 

 pais, at elevations of from 1,500 to 

 2,100 feet, on August 23. 



This geographic race differs from «*—» ~~» -»« 

 the typical form from the Sierra 

 Madre of southern California in the 

 angle of the vertex being slightly 

 more protuberant and more decid- 

 edly acute-angulate when seen from

Measurements. 



Length of body, 10 mm. 14 mm. 



Length of pronotum 2 2.2" 



Length of caudal femur, 8.2 " 9 



The coloration is much as in the typical form, the nymphs being 

 ochraceous-red, one adult female also being decidedly ochraceous.

These reddish individuals were captured on manzanita (Arctostaphylos 

 sp.), with the bark of which they are uniformly colored. 



The habits of this subspecies were essentially the same as those of 

 the typical form. The insects were always more abundant on the 

 bushes along the summits of the ridges.

Paropomala pallida Bruner. 



This species, which appears to be rather generally distributed over 

 the Mohave, Colorado and Gila Deserts in suitable environments, 

 was taken at Cottonwood, Cima, in the foothills of the Bird 

 Spring Mountains, California and Nevada, at Lyons, Nevada, and 

 Las Vegas, Nevada. At Cottonwood, September 9, seven males and 

 one female were taken from dry vegetation along the wash of the 

 Mohave River, where the species was very plentiful. At Cima, August 

 12, a single female was captured, while in the Bird Spring Mountains 

 and at Lyons, August 11, the species was found in patches of dry 

 high grass growing in deep sand, two males and four females being- 

 taken at the former localit}^ and two females at the latter. Grassy 

 spots in the desert were the haunts of the insect at Las Vegas, where 

 eleven males and five females were taken on August 10. 



In size the males are rather uniform, but the females exhibit a con- 

 siderable amount of geographic and some slight individual variation. 

 Specimens from the localities represented measure as follows : 



a considerable amount of individual variation in size in the female 

 sex, the specimens measured being nearer the maximum size in each 

 lot. 



In color, after allowance is made for green and brownish phases, 

 variation appears to be limited to a lightening of the general shades 

 in some specimens and a general intensification in others. The Cotton- 

 wood and Lyons females are in the greenish phase, but the color is 

 decidedly yellowish with a suppression of the lateral bars, which 

 latter is absolute in all the Bird Spring Mountains females and several 

 from Las Vegas. Three of the Bird Spring Mountains females are 

 uniform gall stone yellow, the other one uniform light green with the 

 tegmina yellowish and antennse brownish. One of the Las Vegas

females is similar to the latter, and another from the same locality 

 closely approaches it. Two of the Las Vegas females are light brown- 

 ish much suffused on the head, pronotum and caudal limbs with hoary 

 white, the lateral bars very weak in two specimens. The single Cima 

 female is most peculiarly colored, being umber brownish with the 

 lateral bars marked, but the whole surface except the abdomen is 

 more or less clouded and washed with rather weak hoary white. 

 The males are quite uniform in color compared with the females, all 

 being in the green phase, the lateral bars prominent except in one 

 specimen. The color of the antennae is subject to a considerable 

 amount of variation, and often irrespective of phase, being brownish, 

 yellow or orange. 



The species has previously been recorded from Indio, California, 

 and erroneously as P. virgata from Yuma, Arizona; between Yuma 

 and Gila Bend, Arizona, Palm Springs, Cahon Pass and Lancaster, 

 California. 



Bobtettix punctatus (Scudder). 



As recently shown by Caudell, 5 Scudder's Gymnes punctatus is really 

 a species of Bootettix, related to, but quite distinct from, the type 

 species B. argentatus, which latter appears to be peculiar to the Chihua- 

 huan desert region east of the continental divide. The species of 

 the Western desert tract is invariably found on greasewood (Corillea 

 tridentata), as is also the case with B. argentatus. 



When specimens of B. punctatus are compared with representatives 

 of B. argentatus they show differences as follows :

The series before us is from the following localities : Cotton-

 Range, Providence Mountains, August 12, 1 c? , 2 9 , 2 immature 

 specimens; Cima, August 12, 1 9 ; Kelso, August 12, 1 9,1 immature 

 specimen; foothills Bird Spring Mountains, California and Nevada, 

 August 11, 3 d\ 



On re-examining all the available material of the genus we find 

 that specimens from Yuma, Sentinel and Sahuaro Plain near Tucson 

 Mountains, Arizona, recorded by us 6 as B. argentatus, are really B. 

 punctatus; but it also appears probable that the two species may 

 intergrade in the vicinity of the divide and the more elevated central 

 tract, as the specimen from Sahuaro Plain and other material from 

 Florence, Arizona, show a tendency toward B. argentatus in the form 

 of the fastigium, although distinctly punctatus in the sum total of 

 characters. The Yuma specimens are typical punctatus, the tegmina 

 being even more immaculate than is the case with the Californian 

 specimens. 



It is quite probable that the specimens of this genus previously 

 recorded from Bill Williams Fork, Indio and Palm Springs as B. 

 argentatus belong to B. punctatus. This species produced practically 

 the same stridulation as B. argentatus and in habits was also similar. 

 Amphitornus ornatus McNeill. 



This species is represented by a series of two males and one female 

 from Pasadena, taken August 1 ; five males and three females from 

 Mt. Lowe, taken at elevations of from 4,000 to 4,800 feet, August 8; 

 and one pair from El Toro, Orange County, taken August 20. 



When compared with specimens from Aden, New Mexico, the Cali- 

 fornian individuals are inseparable. The pair from El Toro are more 

 reddish than the others, the pattern also being duller and less con-

1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 425 



trasted, while the Mt. Lowe individuals have the bars and maculations 

 standing out in strong contrast. The femoral bars are limited to the 

 vicinity of the dorso-lateral carina in the El Toro specimens, more 

 extensive ventrad in the Pasadena individuals and covering the greater 

 portion of the lateral face of the femora in the Mt. Lowe representatives. 



At Pasadena the species was taken on the lower slopes of the San 

 Rafael Hills, among shrubs and dry grasses. On Mt. Lowe the insect 

 was found to be very shy, of swift but not long flight, and when pursued 

 closely the individuals would hide in the grasses, very effectually 

 concealing themselves. At El Toro the species was found common in 

 high grain growing along irrigating ditches. 



The species has previously been recorded from the following localities 

 in California: Los Angeles, Point Loma, Lancaster, Cahon Pass and 

 Gazelle. 



Opeia testacea Scudder. 



Eight males, two females and two immature individuals from Las 

 Vegas, taken August 10, are referred to this species. Here the species 

 occurred in a growth of desert plants and grasses on the plain sur- 

 rounding the town. 



The broad postocular bar is more or less strongly present on the 

 head and dorsal half of the lateral lobes of the pronotum in the majority 

 of the specimens, those without indications of the bar having the sides 

 of the head and the whole of the pronotal lobes entirely infuscated. 



The species has been recorded from the following Californian local- 

 ities : Lancaster, Kern City, Tulare. Lathrop and Dominguez. 



Cordillacris grinnelli n. sp.

Related to C. occipitalis, cinerea and affinis, but differing from all 

 in the shorter tegmina which leave a considerable portion of the 

 abdomen exposed. The coloration is nearer to that of affinis, as 

 represented by Idaho specimens, but the longitudinal line on the 

 lateral face of the caudal femora is more continuous than in that 

 species. 



Size medium (for the genus); form moderately slender. Head 

 but little expanding ventrad, with the dorsal length about subequal 

 to that of the dorsum of the pronotum, the occiput very slightly 

 arcuate and the fastigium horizontal when seen from the side; fas- 

 tigium slightly acute-angulate with the apex rotundato-truncate, the

disk of the fastigium with the impressed line of essentially the same 

 form as the margin of the fastigium, the apex of the impressed line 

 being nearer to a line drawn between the cephalic margins of the eyes 

 than to the apex of the fastigium; angle of the fastigium when seen 

 from the side rectangulate, the facial line vertical to between the 

 antennas where the face becomes considerably retreating; lateral 

 foveolae elongate-lanceolate, the ventral margin not strongly marked; 

 frontal costa regularly but very slightly expanding caudad, considerably 

 sulcate ventrad of the ocellus, slightly so dorsad; eyes trigonal-ovoid, 

 in length about equal to the intraocular sulcus, when seen from the 

 dorsum not very prominent; antennae about four-fifths the length of 

 the caudal femora, slightly ensiform proximad. Pronotum with the 

 disk slightly less than one and one-half times as long as the greatest 

 caudal width of the same; cephalic margin subtrun- 

 cate, caudal margin very slightly arcuato-angulate ; 

 median carina not prominent but distinct; lateral 

 carinae but little constricted mesad, moderately 

 divergent caudad, the width between the same 

 cephalad being two-thirds of that caudad; principal 

 transverse sulcus placed distinctly caudad of the 

 middle. Tegmina less than three times as long as 

 the disk of the pronotum, failing to cover the ab- 

 domen by nearly the pronotal length, the tegmina 

 considerably narrowed distad, the apices narrowly 

 rounded. Interspace between the mesosternal lobes 

 decidedly shallow and transverse, the width being 

 equal to that of one of the lobes ; interspace between 

 the metasternal lobes small, subquadrate. Caudal 

 femora reaching to but not surpassing the apex of the abdomen, slender, 

 but more robust than usual in the genus, the greatest width contained 

 about four times in the length, pattern of the paginae well impressed, 

 internal genicular lobes slightly acute, external obtuse-angulate > 

 caudal tibiae slightly arcuate proximad, spines numbering from eleven 

 to thirteen. 



General color ochraceous-buff , becoming ochraceous on the abdomen, 

 hoary-white on the sides of the head, dark clay color on the dorsum 

 of the head and pronotum and french gray distad on the tegmina. 

 The usual broad postocular bar is mars brown, the longitudinal line 

 on the external face of the caudal tibiae is vandyke brown and un- 

 broken. The lateral carinae of the pronotum are ochraceous-buff, 

 marked mesad with very dark brown on the metazona, with the same

In addition to the type we have examined a single paratypic 

 adult and two paratypic immature females. The adult differs from 

 the type only in a slightly greater intensity of coloration. 



We take great pleasure in dedicating this interesting species to Dr. 

 Joseph Grinnell, to whose kindly interest we are indebted for this 

 and a number of other Californian Orthoptera. 



Cordillacris apache Rehn and Hebard. 



This species, previously known only from four localities in south- 

 western New Mexico, is represented by two males and one female 

 from Cima, taken August 12. These specimens were taken in tumble- 

 weed along the railroad track, individuals being very scarce. 



One of the males is slightly more ochraceous than the others, while 

 the female is rather grayish. The specimens are rather smaller than 

 the average when compared with the original series from New Mexico. 



Orphulella compta Scudder. 



This species is represented in the collections before us by eight 

 males and eight females taken at Las Vegas, Nevada, August 10, and 

 fifteen males and five females from Indio, taken July 29. 



All the Indio specimens are in the green phase, although somewhat 

 modified in several, while five-eighths of the Las Vegas series is in 

 the same phase, the remaining specimens being either umber brown 

 and buff in general tones or pinkish ochraceous marked with blackish 

 brown on the sides of the head and pronotum. 



At Las Vegas the species was found well distributed in grass beside 

 a stream. 



The species is now known from Yuma, Bill Williams Fork and San 




428 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



Bernardino Ranch, Arizona; Palm Springs and Indio, California, and 

 Las Vegas, Nevada. 



Orphulella affinis Scudder. 



At Alamitos Bay, July 31, this species was found common among 

 the scant grasses of the beach dunes, while at South Coronado Beach, 

 August 16, it was secured among low salt marsh plants. Nine males, 

 five females and one immature specimen were taken at the former 

 locality and two adults of each sex and four immature individuals at 

 the latter. 



A moderate amount of variation in size in both sexes is presented 

 by the Alamitos Bay series. All the specimens are in the brown 

 phase except three males from Alamitos Bay and one immature speci- 

 men from South Coronado Beach. 



The species is now known from San Diego, South Coronado and 

 Coronado Beach, Alamitos Bay, Kern City and "Colorado Desert," 

 California. 



Napaia graoilis McNeill. 



This interesting species was found at an elevation of 4,000 to 4,800 

 feet on Mt. Lowe, August 8, where it lives among grasses, leaping and 

 crawling about actively. The wings are not used for flight, serving 

 the sole purpose of stridulating organs in the male sex. The stridula- 

 tion is quite like that of Chorthippus curtipennis, but much louder. 



A series of six males and seven females was taken, and but little 

 variation in size and color is to be noticed. The insect appeared to 

 be extremely local and was found in but one location between two 

 small mountain slopes. 



The species is known from Mt. Wilson, 2,400 feet, and Mt. Lowe, 

 4,000 to 4,800 feet, the San Gabriel Mountains near Claremont, at 

 Claremont and Los Angeles, California. 



Psoloessa texana Scudder. 



A series of forty-seven Californian specimens of this very variable 

 species have been examined. This series is distributed as follows: 

 Tia Juana, August 16, one male; Coronado Beach, August 15-16, 

 five males, two females; Alamitos Bay, July 31, one female; Miramar, 

 July 31, five males, two females and three immature specimens; 

 Altadena, August 8, nine males, ten females; Pasadena, August 1, 

 three males, one female; Echo Mountain, San Gabriel Range, August 8, 

 2,700 to 3,500 feet, one male. 



Two of the males and three of the females belong to the form budd- 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 429 



iana, while two males and two females belong to the true texana type. 

 The remainder of the series represent the numerous intermediate 

 phases between the two extremes, except one male from Pasadena 

 which has the dorsum dull maroon, the lateral lobes almost entirely- 

 pale greenish yellow and no broad postocular bar or broken remnants 

 of the same present, the pale lateral carina? being merely edged with 

 dark laterad. 



Specimens from the beach localities, Pasadena and Echo Mountain, 

 are paler in color than the others. 



At Tia Juana the species occurred on rocky hillsides, while at Coro- 

 nado Beach it swarmed on dry grasses. At Alamitos Bay it was 

 taken on dunes, and at Miramar found very active but not common 

 back of the low beach dunes. 



Ageneotettix australis Brunei-.? 



On August 12, at Cima, California, this species was quite common in 

 tumbleweed along the railroad track, a series of twenty-six males 

 and seven females being taken. When compared with specimens from 

 southern Arizona, i.e., Huachuca and Tucson Mountains, the Cima 

 series is uniformly smaller, the difference being less appreciable, 

 however, in the male than in the female. 



The coloration of the series is rather subdued, although the bars on 

 the dorsal surfaces of the caudal femora and the lateral carina? of the 

 pronotum are marked in all the specimens. The caudal tibia? vary 

 somewhat in the exact shade of color, but all possess a distinct ochra- 

 ceous proximal annulus. 



There is considerable individual variation in the length of the 

 tegmina and wings, some having them slightly but distinctly exceeding 

 the tips of the caudal femora, others have them distinctly but not 

 greatly shorter than the tips of the femora, the average being very 

 slightly shorter than the femoral tips. 



This is the first record of the species from California.

 [Hebard Collection.] 



7 A single short-winged female of this genus from Cuyamaca, San Diego 

 County, California (October 1, 1900; G. W. Dunn), in the Academy Collection, 

 has been examined and is referred provisionally to A. occidental^ , although the 

 status of this form is in the authors' opinion very doubtful. It is quite possible 

 that the long-winged forms are more or less completely dimorphic. 




430 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



Allied to A. australis Brunei", but differing in the glaucous caudal 

 tibiae, the less inflated and more tapering caudal femora, the more 

 sharply defined and more decidedly sulcate frontal costa in both sexes, 

 this being narrower dorsad in the new form, and in the facial outline 

 being truncate between the antennae, this being more decided in the 

 male than in the female.

Two paratypic males and one paratypic female, as well as three males 

 from Raymond, Madera County, California, taken September 3, 1907, 

 have been examined by the authors. There appears to be little 

 variation in size and nothing noteworthy in structure, except that the 

 lateral foveolse are broader in some specimens than in the types and 

 in some more rectangular than elongate-trigonal. In color there is 

 considerable variation, a tendency toward linear streaking of the 

 dorsum of head, pronotum and tegmina being noticed in one Summit 

 House male, while two of the Raymond males are rather rufescent and 

 the remaining one is predominatingly buffy yellow, with the pattern 

 strikingly contrasted, the occipital bars and maculations of the anal 

 area of the tegmina absent with those parts pure buffy-yellow. In 

 some specimens the caudal tibia? are inclined more or less strongly 

 toward glaucous. 



At Summit House the species was scarce and extremely active, 

 being found in short, dry grass and tarweed under a scattering growth 

 of oak. At Raymond it was taken in stubble and was not common. 

 The contrastingly colored tarsi are very conspicuous in life. 



Ligurotettix coquilletti McNeill. 



A series of forty-nine specimens from localities in the Mohave and 

 Las Vegas Deserts are referred to this species, to which L. kunzei 

 Caudell from southern Arizona is closely related, differing only in 

 the average larger size and slenderer caudal femora. The series is 

 distributed as follows: Cottonwood, September 9, 2 cT, 1 9 ; 

 Kelso, August 12, 4 d\ 2 9 ; Cima, August 12, 3 d\ 3 9 ; North 

 Range, Providence Mountains, August 12, 1 9 ; foothills Bird Spring 

 Mountains, California and Nevada, August 11, 12 d\ 9 9,1 immature 

 individual; Las Vegas, Nevada, August 10, 9 d\ 2 9 . 



In size there appears to be considerable geographic variation, 

 Cima individuals being quite small, while the largest female of the 

 Bird Spring Mountains series and of the two of that sex from Kelso 

 are almost as large as individuals of L. kunzei. Individual variation 

 is also quite marked in the Bird Spring Mountains series and the two 

 Kelso females are rather different in size, one of the four males from 

 the latter locality also appreciably exceeding the others from that 

 region in size. Average specimens from the various localities measure 

 as follows :

The large Kelso and Bird Spring Mountains females are very similar 

 in size to individuals of the Arizonan kunzei, as will be seen by com- 

 paring the measurements given above with those of kunzei recently 

 published by the authors, 8 but on comparing the proportions of the 

 caudal femur the relationship of the larger Californian specimens is 

 seen to be with coquilletti. It appears quite probable that kunzei is 

 merely a geographic race of coquilletti. 



The color form with blackish brown on the prozona of the lateral 

 lobes of the pronotum, gena j and pleura already described by the 

 authors from Yuma material is strongly represented in the California 

 coquilletti, two males and two females from Cima and five males and 

 four females from the Bird Spring Mountains being in this phase. 

 The Las Vegas and Kelso series are uniformly paler and less contrast- 

 ingly colored, the Las Vegas one very much paler and grayer, than 

 the other lots; the Cottonwood individuals are dusty blackish- 

 gray with the ochraceous tones reduced to a minimum. The dorsal 

 femoral bars are quite strongly marked in the individuals with the 

 blackish-brown markings on the pronotum, while the dorsal aspect 

 is also more buffy in these specimens. 



At Cottonwood the species was found common on greasewood 

 (Covillea tridentata) , and plentiful at Kelso and in the Bird Spring

Mountains on the same plant. At Cima it was found on small thorny 

 bushes, and at Las Vegas one small colony was located in a low thicket 

 of spiny desert bushes. 



The species was originally described from Los Angeles County, 

 California, and has since been recorded from Needles, California, and 

 Yuma, Arizona, by Bruner, and Yuma, Arizona, and Palm Springs and 

 Lancaster, California, by Scudder. Specimens from Yuma examined 

 by the present authors are clearly kunzei, and it appears probable 

 that the records from Yuma and possibly from Needles and Palm 

 Springs may be the same. True coquilletti appears to be a Mohavan 

 and Nevadan form. 



Arphia ramona Rehn. 



From the evidence of a series of eighteen specimens of this species 

 before us it is apparent that it enjoys a considerable vertical range and 

 also that it is considerably modified by the same. This series is from 

 the following localities: Pasadena, July 6, 1899 ((Fordyce Grinnell, 

 Jr.), two males; Mt. Lowe, August 8, 4,700 feet, one female, 5,300 to 

 5,600 feet, one male; Kenworthy, San Jacinto Mountains, 4,500 to 5,000 

 feet, June 3-8 (Fordyce Grinnell, Jr.), one male, three females; Straw- 

 berry Valley, San Jacinto Mountains, 6,000 feet, July 18 (F. Grinnell, 

 Jr.), one male; Santa Ana River, San Bernardino Mountains, 5,500 to 

 6,200 feet, July 1-14 (Joseph Grinnell), three males, one female; 

 Fish Creek, San Bernardino Mountains, 6,500 to 7,200 feet, June 17 

 to July 10 (Joseph Grinnell), one male, three females; Mt. Pinos, 

 Kern County, June 6, 1904 (F. Grinnell, Jr.), one female. 



When compared with the types from San Diego and a paratypic 

 series of two males and three females, the specimens from points under 

 6,000 feet elevation are seen to be very similar to the types, the tegmina 

 and wings alone being slightly longer in several of the mountain 

 specimens. The individuals from greater elevations than 6,000 

 feet show a perceptible reduction in size, which is very apparent when 

 the specimens are arranged serially according to altitude. There also 

 appears to be a slight flattening of the median carina of the pronotum 

 in individuals from the higher regions. 



The female specimen from Fish Creek, 7,200 feet elevation, measures 

 as follows: Length of body, 31 mm.; pronotum, 6.2; tegmen, 26; 

 caudal femur, 15.3. 



There is a considerable amount of individual variation in the general 

 color, this being blackish or brownish, strongly speckled or nearly 

 uniform, the pale stripe on the anal field of the tegmina also being 

 equally variable in its width, presence or absence. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 435 



At 5,300 to 5,600 feet on Mt. Lowe the species was found on a steep 

 rock slide and at 4,700 feet it occurred on a steep slope. 



This species has been previously recorded from but two localities- 

 San Diego and Los Angeles, California. 

 Chimarocephala incisa Caudell. 



A single specimen of this species, taken at an elevation of 5,500 feet 

 on the Santa Ana River, San Bernardino Mountains, June 14, by Dr. 

 Joseph Grinnell, has been examined. This individual is quite blackish, 

 with the femoral and pronotal maculations strongly contrasted when 

 compared with individuals from San Diego and Claremont, California. 



We have followed Caudell 9 in using this name for the species usually 

 known as C. pacifica Thomas. 



Encoptolophus californicus Bruner. 



A female specimen of this species was taken among sand dunes at 

 Alamitos Bay, July 31, while one male individual was captured along 

 the Mohave River at Cottonwood, September 9. The Cottonwood 

 specimen is smaller than the measurements given by Bruner for the 

 male sex, the length of body being 15 mm., that of the pronotum 3.3, 

 of the tegmen 13 and of the caudal femur 10, although in almost all 

 other respects the specimen is typical. The lateral carinae of the 

 pronotum are somewhat undulate on the prozona in the male, although 

 nearly straight in the female. Both specimens are in a brownish 

 phase similar to the male type. 



The only previous record of the species is that of the type — Los 

 Angeles, California. 

 Encoptolophus robustus n. sp. 



Type : 9 ; Los Angeles River near Los Angeles, California. August 

 24, 1907. (Otho Poling.) [Hebard Collection.] 



Closely related to E. texensis and subgracilis, differing in the more 

 robust build, more prominent and elevated pronotal carinae, the 

 lateral ones being less divergent caudad than in texensis, in the more 

 excavate f astigium and the more inflated caudal femora. 



This species is not at all close to E. pallidus Bruner, with cotypes of 

 which it has been compared. 



Size medium; form robust though slightly compressed. Head 

 with the dorsum considerably arcuate when seen from the side, 

 though not elevated dorsad of the median pronotal carina, interspace 

 between the eyes rather broad though less than the short diameter 

 of the eye; f astigium as much arcuate declivent as the occiput rises 

 to the interspace between the eyes, subpyriform, slightly longer than 

 wide, rather deeply excavate, a distinct median carina present on the

 large, moderately excavate; frontal costa as a whole rather broad, 

 moderately and regularly expanding from the distinct fastigio-facial 

 division to the ocellus, below which it is slightly constricted then 

 moderately expanded to the clypeal suture, sulcate throughout except 

 close to the clypeal suture; eyes reniform-elliptical, slightly prominent, 

 somewhat exceeding the infraocular sulcus in length; antennae 

 distinctly less than the head and pronotum in length. Pronotum 

 with the median carina moderately elevated, rather uniform in height, 

 although the section on the metazona is a trifle lower than that on the

 carinse marked, regularly divergent caudad, the space separating 

 them caudad half again as much as that cephalad, the carinas being 

 sinuate for a short distance on the caudal portion of the prozona; 

 cephalic angle of the disk broad obtuse, caudal angle of the disk 

 slightly obtuse with the angle narrowly rounded; 

 lateral lobes deeper than long, slightly narrowing

 tips of the caudal femora; intercalary vein with 

 the proximal half nearer to the ulnar vein, the distal 

 half equidistant between the ulnar and median 

 veins. Interspace between the mesosternal lobes 

 strongly transverse ; interspace between the metaster- 

 nal lobes quadrate. Caudal femora considerably 

 inflated, the greatest width being about one-third 

 the length; pattern of the pagina well impressed 

 and regular, the expansion of the ventral carinas 

 slight; caudal tibiae with nine to ten spines on the 

 external margins.

 ones oblique and the third from the base fading distad, the apical 

 portion with numerous very small dots, the bars not reaching the anal 

 field which has a number of small irregular maculations. Wings 

 bluish-hyaline proximad, the apex with the slightest possible infuma- 

 tion, the stigma brownish. Caudal femora with three dark bands, 

 one median, one pre-apical, one genicular, these bands more distinct 

 and blackish on the dorsum, genicular arches and lower portion of 

 the paginae, which latter the median one crosses obliquely, the pre- 

 apical one being marked on the ventral surface, though all are present 

 on the ventral sulcus and internal face; caudal tibiae pale glaucous-

In addition to the type two specimens of this species, one male and 

 one female, in the U. S. National Museum collection, from Los Angeles

 the male is distinctly very pale yellowish-hyaline proximad. 



Gamnula pellucida (Scudder). 



On Santa Catalina Island this species was found to be extremely 

 local, but plentiful in a small area of short grass, where one male and 

 eight females were taken on August 7. At Mill Valley, August 23, 

 the species was found uncommon on dry grassy hillsides, two females 

 being taken, while a single male was captured at Merced, August 30, 

 in very dry, }^ellow, oat-like grass. 



The Santa Catalina Island and Merced individuals are more yellowish 

 in color than the Mill Valley specimens. 



Hippiscus pardalinus (Saussure). 



Six specimens, two males and four females, from the San Bernardino 

 Mountains, taken by Dr. Joseph Grinnell, belong to this widely dis- 

 tributed species. One male and two females are from Fish Creek, 

 at an elevation of 6,500 feet, June 18-20; the remaining individuals 

 being from the South Fork of the Santa Ana River, at an elevation 

 of 6,200 to 6,700 feet, July 1-24. 



The disk of the wing is orange vermilion in all the specimens instead 

 of yellow as usually described, but in general characters and proportions 

 no other differences are noted. Several of the females have a con- 

 siderable amount of hoary-white suffusion. 



The only previous exact Californian records were from San Diego 

 and Rock Spring, southern California. 



Hippiscus negleotus (Thomas). 



Four males and four females of this species from the South Fork 

 of the Santa Ana River, San Bernardino Mountains, taken at an 

 elevation of 6,200 feet, on July 6 and August 26, by Dr. Joseph Grinnell, 

 and a pair from Mt. Pinos, the female with a supplementary "Potrero" 

 label, taken June, 1904 ( 9 June 7), by F. Grinnell, Jr., have been 

 examined. A considerable amount of variation is present in the 

 series, but nothing other than one would expect in this very variable 

 species. The tegminal stripe is very broadly marked in one male 

 specimen. 



This is the first record of this species from southern California, the 

 only previous records from the State being from the Sierran region. 



Leprus interior Bruner. 



A single male of this species from the foothills of the Bird Spring 

 Mountains, McCollough Range, Nevada, August 11, has been examined. 

 It is very similar in character to a series from the Salt Lake Valley, 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 439 



Utah, and was collected on a bare volcanic mountain side. The 

 specimen is slightly smaller than the original measurements of the 

 male sex given by Bruner. This is the first record of the species from 

 Nevada, and in fact from any locality but the Salt Lake Valley. 



Leprus glaucipennis Scudder. 10 



A series of eleven males and eight females of this species are in- 

 cluded in the collection, taken at the following localities : Tia Juana, 

 August 16, two d\ one nymph; El Toro, August 20, one d\ one 9 ; 

 Santa Catalina Island, August 3 and 7, six d\ one 9 ; Pasadena, 

 August 1, two d\ three 9 , one additional 9 taken June 10, 1898, by 

 F. Grinnell, Jr., and Echo Mountain, San Gabriel Range, elevation 

 3,100 feet, August 8, two 9 . 



At Tia Juana it was found on rocky hillsides, while at El Toro it 

 occurred in rolling grain fields. On Santa Catalina Island it was 

 uncommon in dry places, among rocks and scant grasses in a canyon 

 bed, the sides of the mesa of the San Rafael Hills being frequented at 

 Pasadena where it was very scarce. On Echo Mountain the species 

 was numerous at 3,100 feet elevation. 



There is some variation in general size and in the length of the wing 

 in this species, the general coloration also exhibiting a tendency to 

 red-brown suffusions, particularly on the head and pronotum, while 

 the disk of the wing shows less greenish and more bluish in some 

 specimens than in others. The latter is particularly true of one 

 Pasadena female specimen. 



This species has been recorded from Point Loma, La Jolla, Los 

 Angeles, Rubio Wash, Altadena, Santa Catalina and Santa Rosa 

 Islands, California, and Hermosillo, Sonora and Durango and San Luis 

 Potosi, Mexico. Two females from San Diego have been examined 

 by the authors. 



Dissosteira spurcata Saussure. 



A series of fifteen males and nine females was taken in a field of 

 stubble at Raymond, September 3, and a single female was secured in 

 a field of very dry, yellow, oat-like grass at Merced, August 30. 



This species exhibits a great amount of variation in size and color, 

 the measurements of the extremes of each sex being as follows : 



10 The specimens from the Huachuca Mountains, Arizona, recorded by the 

 senior author (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1907, p. 37) as L. glaucipennis, 

 when examined with the present series are seen to be L. cyaneus.

Length of body, 27 



Length of tegmen, 29 



The measured specimens are all from Raymond. 



Three of the Raymond males and two of the females are extremely 

 pale in color, almost uniform straw-yellow in general tone, the pronotal, 

 tegminal and femoral maculations being of the very faintest character. 

 The wings of these pale individuals are either clear yellowish-hyaline 

 without any maculations or with very faint indications of the fuscous 

 cloud of the normal type. This yellowish phase is approached by 

 two of the Raymond females, the remainder, however, of both sexes 

 being of the normal type. 



The habits of this species have been described by the authors in a 

 previous paper. 11 



This species has been reported from the San Joaquin-Sacramento 

 Valley between Merced and Redding. 

 Dissosteira venusta (St&l). 



This species has been examined from a number of localities extending 

 from Miramar and San Diego to Mill Valley, California. The series 

 is distributed as follows: Miramar, July 31, ten d\ 7 9 ; Pasadena, 

 August 1, five cT , ten 9 ; Rubio Canyon, San Gabriel Mountains, 

 August 8, three cT ; Santa Catalina Island, August 3, four c?, seven 9 ; 

 Raymond, September 3, three cT ; Ahwahnee, September 3, one 9 ; 

 Miami, September 3, one 9 ; Summit House, September 3, three d\ 

 one 9 ; Sentinel, August 31, one d\ 



Specimens from the vicinity of Pasadena and Miramar are as a rule 

 larger than those from the other localities, resembling in this respect 

 specimens from San Diego. Santa Catalina Island individuals are 

 smaller than representatives from the adjacent mainland, while the 

 specimens in the Mill Valley series are appreciably smaller than the 

 southern Calif orni an mainland material. Specimens from the west 

 slope of the Sierras are very similar in size to Mill Valley individuals.

There is an appreciable amount of individual variation in each 

 lot, but apparently average specimens have been selected for measur- 

 ing. 



The caudal angle of the disk of the pronotum varies somewhat 

 in the degree of angulation, one extreme being subrectangulate, the 

 other distinctly obtuse, the apex more or less rounded. The median 

 carina of the pronotum is rather variable in elevation and inflation, 

 and in a single female from Ahwahnee, which has the pronotal crest 

 quite low, the prozonal portion is uniform and not arcuate. 



The general base color varies from dull blackish-brown to ochraceous- 

 buff , the maculations more or less prominent in all but a few individ- 

 uals which have them quite weak. The color variations, as far as 

 can be determined, are not correlated geographically, dark and pale 

 individuals being present from localities represented by a series of 

 any size. There is also some variation in the intensity, fenestration and 

 shape of the fuscous band of the wing and also a little in the width of 

 the same. 



This species is usually common where found and is very active and 



elusive, flying short distances and alighting precipitately. It occurred 



on dry grass hillsides at Mill Valley and in tarweed, stubble and 



meadow land on the west slope of the Sierras. At Miramar it was

found back from the shore, along the border of a field of dry grass near 

 high weeds, while in Santa Catalina Island it frequented dry places 

 among rocks and grasses. 



The range of this species in California is entirely west of the Sierras 

 and Sierra Madre and San Jacinto ranges, as far as known not occurring 

 in the true desert regions. Coquillett has recorded it from the San 

 Joaquin-Sacramento Valley from Redding to Merced and from Los 

 Angeles, while Baker has credited it to Claremont and Rehn to San 

 Diego. Stal described it from San Francisco. We have followed 

 Bruner 12 in placing this species in the genus Dissosteira, to which it 

 appears to be more closely related than to Spharagemon.

There is considerable individual variation in size, this, however, 

 being more noticeable in the male than in the female, while in color 

 the onty noticeable variation is a tendency toward a blackish coloration 

 in some individuals and washing with ochraceous in others. 



At Pasadena the species was found to be common on the slopes . of 

 the San Rafael Hills, while it was equally numerous on Echo Mountain. 

 At Tia Juana it occurred on a rocky hillside overgrown with bushes 

 which were dry and parched. 



The species has been recorded from Los Angeles, San Diego and 

 Claremont, southern California. 



Mestobregma rubripenne (Bruner). 



A single male and three females of this species were taken at Cima, 

 August 12, in low bushes near the railroad, and a single female was 

 secured in the foothills of the Bird Spring Mountains, California, 

 August 11, in sand. At Cima the species was extremely local. 



The Californian specimens are all very slightly smaller than repre- 

 sentatives from the Huachuca Mountains, Arizona, and also appre- 

 ciably paler, but no other characters of importance show differences 

 worthy of mention. The pattern, form of the caudal femora, height 

 of the median carina of the pronotum and width of the wing-bar are 

 the same as in the Arizona material. The disk of the wing is yellow 

 or yellowish in all but one specimen.

1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 443 



The previous records of the species are all from southeastern and 

 southern Arizona. 



Trepidulus rosaoeus (Scudder). 



At Las Vegas, Nevada, August 10, this species was found numerous 

 in bare desert places, both the typical phase with the wing roseate 

 proximad and one with the same portion hyaline with an extremely 

 faint whitish suffusion being taken. The series numbers twenty- 

 five males and seven females, each phase represented by sixteen indi- 

 viduals. Fourteen males and two females have the wings roseate 

 and eleven males and five females have the same members hyaline. 



There is little variation in size, although the tegmina and wings 

 vary somewhat in length. The degree of production of the ventro- 

 caudal angle of the lateral lobes of the pronotum varies considerably 

 and in a number of specimens the angle is well rounded. The character 

 of this angle cannot be correlated with the color of the wings. The 

 general color is more ashy in some individuals than in others, some- 

 times touched with dull reddish and again with the maculations more 

 decided than in others. The Nevada specimens as a rule are paler than 

 representatives from southeastern Arizona, but they are well matched 

 in individuals from the lower Arizona deserts at Yuma and Florence. 



Derotmema delioatulum Scudder. 



The published records and the material at hand indicate that this 

 species is well distributed over the lower portions of the Mohave 

 desert and a considerable area of the Gila desert. A series of fifty- 

 four Calif ornian and Nevadan specimens is now before us, the following 

 localities being represented: Cottonwood, September 9, two males, 

 two females; Goffs, San Bernardino County, California, September 

 10, one female; Kelso, August 12, five males, seven females; North 

 Range of Providence Mountains, August 12, six males, four females; 

 foothills Bird Spring Mountains, California, August 11, two males, 

 six females; foothills Bird Spring Mountains, Nevada, August 11, 

 ten males, eight females; Arden, Lincoln County, Nevada, August 

 9, one female. When compared with two pairs from Sentinel, Mari- 

 copa County, Arizona, the eyes of all the Californian and Nevadan 

 individuals are seen to be slightly less prominent than in the Sentinel 

 specimens, but in all the essential characters they fully agree. The 

 geographic and individual differences in size are very slight, but the 

 caudal margin of the disk of the pronotum varies from broadly obtuse- 

 angulate to subarcuate. The Kelso and Goffs individuals are paler 

 than the others, in this respect resembling the Sentinel specimens, 




444 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



although the latter have the pattern more decided than the former. 

 The Bird Spring Mountains series has as a rule a pale ferruginous 

 appearance, although a few are somewhat ashy, while the North 

 Range and Goffs specimens are decidedly ashy, the former, however, 

 with the pattern well contrasted, in the males as strongly as in the 

 Sentinel individuals. The Kelso series is whitish or pale buffy yellow 

 in general tone, while the Cottonwood specimens more nearly resemble 

 the Bird Spring Mountains series than any of the others. The Arden 

 specimen is much like Kelso individuals, but the head and portions 

 of the pronotum and cephalic and median limbs are suffused with 

 dull vermilion. 



As far as examined the bar on the wing appears to be uniform in 

 size, while the disk is very slightly more yellowish than in the Sentinel 

 specimens. 



At Kelso, in the Bird Spring Mountains, and in the North Range 

 of the Providence Mountains the species was found on the ground and 

 also on small desert weeds, frequently in arroyos. 



The previous Californian records of the species are from Mohave 

 and Lancaster. 



Derotmema laticinctum Scudder, 



It was with considerable surprise that this species was recognized 

 in the series of Orthoptera taken at Cima, California, on August 12. 

 This locality is represented by a series of sixteen males and four females 

 which fully agrees with eastern Arizona and New Mexico material. 

 At Cima the species was plentiful. 



This is the first record of the species from California. 



Derotmema saussureanum Scudder. 



This southern Californian species is represented by a series of thirty 

 specimens taken as follows : Pasadena, August 1, eleven males, thirteen 

 females; near Rubio Canyon, altitude 1,400 to 1,600 feet, August 8, 

 two females; Los Angeles River, Los Angeles, August 24, one male; 

 Beaumont, Riverside County, July 30, one male; Devore, San Ber- 

 nardino County, September 9, one male; summit Cahon Pass, Sep- 

 tember 9, one female. 



There is considerable variation in the base color in the series, the 

 Pasadena representation exhibiting numerous modifications, ashy, 

 buffy, dull reddish-brown and sometimes overcast with a hoary 

 suffusion. 



At Pasadena the insect was found common on dry spots in and near 

 the Arroyo Seco. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 445 



The species has previously been recorded from San Bernardino, 

 Colton, Claremont, Los Angeles, Rubio Wash, Anaheim, San Diego, 

 Coronado and Cahon Pass. 



Conozoa behrensi Saussure. 



A series of fifty-nine specimens is now before us, distributed as fol- 

 lows: Altadena, August 25 (Poling), nine males, sixteen females; 

 Pasadena, August 1, fifteen males, five females; Alamitos Bay, July 

 31, five males, five females; Tia Juana, August 16, one male, two 

 females; Cottonwood, September 9, one male; Tracy, Alameda 

 County, August 30, one female. There is considerable individual 

 variation in size in both sexes, the extremes of the series of females 

 from Alamitos Bay, for example, measuring as follows : 



Length of body, 26 mm. 30 mm. 



Length of pronotum, 5.1" 7 



Length of tegmen, 25.2 " 30 



Length of caudal femur, 14.8 " 17.8 " 



In color numerous shades of umber, gray-brown, dull ferruginous 

 and occasionally pale ochre occur as the principal value, the macula- 

 tions being very pale in some individuals and strongly marked in 

 others. The coloration of this insect appears to be profoundly modified 

 by its environment, an individual from the sandy Arroyo Seco at 

 Pasadena being in the pale ochre phase. The tegminal maculations 

 are as a rule quite distinct, though varying considerably in length, the 

 width, however, showing but little variation, while the positions of 

 the bars appear to be fixed. 



The fuscous band of the wing varies considerably in width and 

 intensity, while the depth of the yellow color of the disk is distinctly 

 variable. The caudal tibise are purplish pink in some specimens and 

 vermilion in others, the latter in by far the greater majority of the 

 specimens. The very pale Arroyo Seco specimen has the caudal 

 tibise rather dark flesh color, yellowish toward the base, no blackish 

 genicular patch present. The latter is strongly marked in the 

 majority of the specimens. 



At Tia Juana the species was found in a dry river bottom, some of 

 the Pasadena individuals being from a similar situation, while at 

 Alamitos Bay it frequented scant vegetation on the beach dunes. 

 Its occurrence at Cottonwood in typical Mohavan surroundings is 

 rather surprising as the species is only .known elsewhere from the San 

 Joaquin Valley and the slopes and valleys facing the Pacific. 




446 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



This species has been definitely recorded from San Diego, Claremont 

 and Guadelupe, California. 

 Conozoa salcifrons (Seudder). 



At Las Vegas, Nevada, a series of ten males and ten females of this 

 species was taken on August 10, while a single male was collected at 

 Indio on July 29. 



When compared with a considerable series from Yuma, Arizona, 

 no differences are noticeable. 



The previous Californian records of the species were from near the 

 Mohave River (type locality) and Indio. No Nevada records have 

 previously been published. 

 Trimerotropis cristata McNeill. 



Two males and two females of this very pale colored species were 

 taken, August 10, at Las Vegas, Nevada, in typical desert surroundings. 



The specimens are quite uniform in coloration and size. 



The previous records of the species are from San Julio, Lower 

 California, and Salt Lake Valley, Utah. 



Trimerotropis albolineata (Bruner). 



Three females of this species were taken in the Arroyo Seco at 

 Pasadena, August 1, while a single male was secured at Beaumont, 

 Riverside County, California, on July 30. Two females taken at 

 Pasadena, June 21 and July 1, by Fordyce Grinnell, Jr., have also been 

 examined. 



Some individuals are much more ferruginous than others, and the 

 pattern of the lateral lobes of the pronotum is fainter in one of the 

 Pasadena specimens than in the other individuals examined. 



This species is now known from Los Angeles, Pasadena, Ontario, 

 San Bernardino County, Beaumont, Riverside County, and San Diego, 

 California, and southern Arizona. 



Trimerotropis caeruleipes Seudder. 



An interesting series of seventy-eight specimens of this species is 

 now before us, all but ten of which were taken by the authors. The 

 localities represented are as follows: Mt. Tamalpais, 2,100 to 2,500 

 feet elevation, August 23, five males and one female; Sentinel, Yose- 

 mite National Park, August 31, two males; Yosemite Valley, 4,000 to 

 5,400 feet, September 1, six males, six females; Grouse Creek, Yose- 

 mite National Park, September 1, two males, one female; Eight-Mile 

 Camp, Yosemite National Park, September 1, four males, three 

 females; Mariposa Grove, September 2, four males, four females; 

 Miami, September 3, three males, three females ; Mt. Lowe, 5,200 feet to 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 447 



summit, August 8, two males, three females; Echo Mountain, August 

 8, four males; Mt. Wilson, 5,000 feet, September 15, one male; Pasa- 

 dena, August 1, one male, June 23, one male and three females, col- 

 lected by F. Grinnell, Jr.; Santa Catalina Island, August 3 and 7, 

 three males, one female; Strawberry Valley, 5,000 feet, San Jacinto 

 Mountains, July 7-9, F. Grinnell, Jr., one male, two females. A single 

 male from Ormsby County, Nevada (Baker), and another of the same 

 sex from Cuyamaca Mountains, San Diego County, California, October 

 1, 1900 (G. W. Dunn), have also been examined. 



In a recent paper 13 Mr. Caudell has shown that Trimerotropis tessel- 

 lata is not a valid species, and the material before us contains not only 

 additional evidence on this point, but also enough to relegate T. caiig- 

 nosa to the synonymy as well, wliile even the recognition of the two 

 "forms" as varieties appears undesirable, the intermediates being 

 so numerous and graduated. 



Almost one-half of the specimens in hand are spread, so the character 

 of the fuscous band of the wing, the opacity of the disk and the amount 

 of infuscation of the apex can be readily observed in a number of 

 individuals. 



The dark form, called caiignosa by McNeill, with blackish coloration, 

 the disk of the wing transparent faintly colored with greenish, and the 

 faintly fuliginous apex with the extreme tip slightly infuscated, is 

 represented by individuals from Mt. Tamalpais, Miami, Mariposa 

 Grove, Mt. Lowe, Mt. Wilson and Pasadena. One female from Miami, 

 another from Grouse Creek and a male from Yosemite Valley have 

 the metazona of the pronotum ferruginous, strongly contrasted with 

 the blackish general coloration. 



The remaining specimens present a great complex of color tones, 

 the dark shades being umber and vandyke brown, while the light bars 

 are hoary, buffy and pale ferruginous. The wing band varies from 

 very weak to well marked, while the apex is hyaline or more or less 

 strongly fuliginous, sometimes with the greater portion of its surface 

 infuscate. When the wing band is well defined the apex is usually 

 hyaline, but this is not invariable. The shade of yellow of the disk of 

 the wing varies considerably, a few specimens, aside from the caiignosa 

 type individuals, having it very weak. 



This species was found particularly common throughout the conifer 

 forests of the Yosemite region, in company with the slightly less plenti- 

 ful and less widely distributed Trimerotropis fallox. Both of these 



Proc. U. S. Nat. Mas., XXXIV, p. 75. 




448 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



species were found in numbers on the bare needle-strewn ground 

 under the conifers, especially in sunny spots. It was easier to capture 

 T. cceruleipes, but owing to their numbers series of both species were 

 taken without difficulty. The previous Californian records of the 

 species are from Sissons, Marble Valley, El Dorado County, Los 

 Angeles and Cuyamaca. 



Trimerotropis bifasciata Brunei-. 



A pair of this species were taken in dry brush and grass between 

 Rubio Canyon and Altadena, at an elevation of about 1,500 feet, 

 August 8. 



This species was scarce, but two specimens only being seen. The 

 previous records are from Los Angeles and Tehama County, California, 

 and Spokane, Washington. 



Trimerotropis koebelei (Bruner). 



This species was found to be common at Sentinel, Yosemite National 

 Park, August 31 and September 1, a series of eighteen males and three 

 females being taken, as well as a single female at another point in 

 the Yosemite Valley on the last mentioned date. 



Wherever collecting was done about Sentinel this species was found 

 and taken without difficulty. 



The series exhibits a moderate amount of variation in size, and the 

 lateral lobes of the pronotum have the ventro-caudal margin either 

 with a distinct obtuse angulation or well rounded, the great majority 

 having this region very slightly angulate. The coloration varies 

 somewhat in depth and slightly so in pattern, although the last is 

 chiefly due to intensification or weakening. In but one specimen has 

 the anal area of the tegmina any marked maculations, and then but 

 a number of scattered spots. The black bands between the eyes, one 

 above the antennse, the other below the same, are often almost as 

 distinct as in T. cincta. The dorsal one, however, is frequently absent, 

 but the ventral one is present more or less distinctly in all but one 

 male specimen, which latter with one of the females is remarkable 

 in having the pronotum and head ochraceous-yellow. The broad 

 white bars on the sides of the face are distinct in all but the two 

 individuals mentioned above, although weak in a very dull colored 

 female. The black markings on the lateral lobes of the pronotum 

 are present in practically all the specimens, while the tegminal bars 

 are distinct in all the specimens, although rather weak in several, 

 the width of the bars varying considerably. The three femoral 

 bars — median, preapical and apical — are marked in the majority of 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 449 



the specimens. The wing band is uniform in the spread specimens, 

 but not strongly indicated or greatly contrasted. 



The previous records of the species are from Placer County, Duns- 

 muir, Siskiyou County, and San Francisco, California. 



Trimerotropis thalassioa Bruner. 



This interesting and peculiar species, concerning which practically 

 nothing has been published, is represented by a series of forty-nine 

 specimens from several different regions. Two males were taken, 

 August 23, on Mt. Tamalpais, one at 1,500, the other at 2,100 feet 

 elevation. On Mt. Lowe, August 8 and 24 and September 1, this 

 species was taken at elevations ranging from 4,300 to 5,600 feet, a 

 series of twenty males and twelve females being secured. Two males 

 were taken August 8, in Rubio Canyon, between 2,200 and 3,000 feet, 

 while three of each sex were secured on Santa Catalina Island, August 3. 

 Two males and a female taken at 5,000 feet on Mt. Wilson, September 

 15, 1908, and four females from Arroyo Seco Canyon, San Gabriel 

 Range, 3,000 feet elevation, October 8, taken by Fordyce Grinnell, Jr., 

 have also been examined. 



The favorite habitat of this species was found to be practically the 

 same as that of Morsea californica. The insect was found plentiful, 

 especially on Mt. Lowe among the manzanita bushes on the higher 

 slopes. Owing to their lack of wariness and usual short flight speci- 

 mens were easily taken. They were noted to alight almost invariably 

 upon the manzanita bushes. 



The Mt. Tamalpais specimens are quite small when compared with 

 the Mt. Lowe individuals; the Mt. Wilson, Arroyo Seco Canyon and 

 Rubio Canyon representatives also being appreciably smaller than the 

 Mt. Lowe series, but the difference is not as great as in the Mt. Tamal- 

 pais specimens. The Santa Catalina Island specimens are also smaller 

 than the average Mt. Lowe individual. Average individuals from the 

 localities represented measure as follows :

Rubio Canyon (2,200 to 3,000 feet), 



Santa Catalina Island, ... 26 26 14.5 



The Mt. Lowe series also exhibits considerable individual variation 

 in size in the specimens taken on the summit, the extremes of the males 

 measuring as follows : Length of body, 17-22 mm. ; length of tegmen, 

 20-25 mm. ; length of caudal femur, 10.3-13 mm. In none of the other 

 lots of specimens does individual variation play such a decided part, 

 although the Arroyo Seco Canyon and Santa Catalina representatives 

 show it in a lesser degree. 



The basic color pattern has already been described by Brunei, but 

 the tegminal bars show almost endless variations in width, intensity 

 and solidarity, while the base color varies from pale ochraceous-buff 

 shades to dull blue-gray, frequently pale pinkish-red. The fuscous 

 band of the wing is also of variable intensity, being distinct and 

 continuous, although not sharply defined, or nearly lacking, indi- 

 cated only by a cloud at the stigma and another one just beyond 

 the middle of the wing. The Santa Catalina series has the tegminal 

 bars broader and more contrasted than in any of the other specimens. 



The principal features of the species which strike one at first glance 

 are the deep head, the usually pale and often black-dotted caudal 

 margin of the pronotal disk, the peculiar granular character of the 

 coloration and the coloration of the caudal femora. 



The only previous record of this species is the original of Bruner, 

 who described it from Los Angeles, California. Los Angeles County 

 was probably intended. 



Trimerotropis latifasoiata Scudder, 



A single female of this species was taken at Las Vegas, August 10. 

 While somewhat larger than Scudder's measurements, this individual 

 agrees very well with his description. 



This species has been recorded from Wallula, Washington, Salt Lake 

 Valley and Lake Point, Utah, and from Nebraska, although specimens 

 from the last mentioned State may be T. laticincta Saussure, if the 

 two forms are considered separable. 




190«J.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 451 



Trimerotropis oalifornioa Bruner. 



This interesting species is represented by a series of twenty-eight 

 specimens from the following localities: Pasadena, July 14, 1898, 

 F. Grinnell, Jr., two males; Pasadena, August 1, 1907, nine males, 

 seven females; Los Angeles River, August 24, one male, one female; 

 near Rubio Canyon, San Gabriel Mountains, 1,000 to 1,600 feet, 

 August 8, four males, two females; Altadena, August 8, one male; 

 summit Cahon Pass, September 9, one male. There is a moderate 

 amount of variation in size and also a great deal in coloration, although 

 the latter is chiefly in the depth of the pattern. Some individuals 

 have the tegminal bars poorly contrasted, but in all they are fairly 

 well defined, though made up of annuli in some individuals. There is 

 some individual variation in the width of the tegminal bars and in 

 the number and position of the quadrate annuli in the apical portion. 

 One of the Pasadena females is entirely suffused with ferruginous, 

 others are partially so, while some are quite dull and others hoary- 

 white. The Cahon Pass specimen is a typical individual, in a grayish 

 type of coloration seen in a pair from Claremont. The wing-band 

 varies to an appreciable extent in width and also somewhat in 

 position. 



The species was nowhere really plentiful and was found to be local 

 in distribution, restricted usually to dry places, particularly in the 

 Arroyo Seco at Pasadena. Although moderately vigorous it was 

 more difficult to find than to capture. 



This species has been recorded from San Luis Valley, Claremont, 

 Los Angeles and Ontario, California. 



Trimerotropis strenua McNeill. 



This Great Basin and interior desert form is represented by four 

 males from the Mohave desert and the region to the north, two taken 

 at Cima, August 12, on a plateau of tree yucca, one at Cottonwood, 

 September 9, and the other in the foothills of the Bird Spring Moun- 

 tains, Lincoln County, Nevada, August 11. 



The Cima specimens are inseparable from Salt Lake City individuals, 

 but a tendency toward call) arnica is noted in the Cottonwood speci- 

 men. The latter has the wing-band narrower than in typical individ- 

 uals, but the general facies is more distinctly that of strenua than that 

 of californica, although the former is probably nothing more than a 

 geographic race of the latter. 



In action the species was more vigorous than T. californica and is 

 apparently a very much scarcer form. The specimens captured 

 at Cima were taken on the tree yucca plateau among brush. 




452 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



This species is now known from Salt Lake City and Valley and Beaver 

 Creek Hills, Utah, Tucson and San Bernardino Ranch, Arizona, and 

 Cima and Cottonwood, California. 

 Trimerotropis inoonspicua Bruner. 



Among the tree yuccas at Cima seven males and two females of 

 this species were taken on August 12. At first glance two species 

 appear to be represented in the series, one typically having the teg- 

 minal bars more sharply defined and usually broad, the wing-band 

 rather broad and hardly interrupted and the ventral sulcus of the 

 caudal femora blackish with two yellowish interruptions; the other 

 type having the general coloration paler and more uniformly buffy 

 and hoary-white, the tegminal bars narrower and frequently divided 

 into the component annuli, the wing-band narrow, reduced in length 

 and broadly interrupted, and the ventral sulcus of the caudal femora 

 yellowish white with a single blackish interruption. When compared 

 with all the specimens in the series these apparently separate types 

 are found to have absolutely no structural characters to separate 

 them, and one specimen having the tegminal bars as in the first has the 

 wing-band nearer to that of the second described, while several other 

 specimens apparently belonging to the second type have a decided 

 blackish cloud at the base of the femoral sulcus. 



This species has previously been recorded from the Grand River 

 region of western Colorado and Bright Angel, Grand Canyon, Arizona. 



Trimerotropis vinculata Scudder. 



This widely distributed species is represented by a considerable 

 series of specimens distributed as follows: Mill Valley, August 23, 

 one male; Merced, August 30, one female; Tracy, Alameda County, 

 August 30, one female; Echo Mountain, August 8, two males; Rubio 

 Canyon, August 8, four males; Altadena, August 25, one female;

The Santa Catalina series is as a whole distinctly smaller than any 

 of the other comparable lots, considerable individual variation being 

 noted, the measured specimens, however, being average ones. The 

 specimens from the coast of the adjacent mainland, i.e., Miramar 

 and Alamitos Bay, are but little larger than the Catalina individuals, 

 although there is also a considerable amount of individual difference, 

 while the majority of the Pasadena representatives are considerably 

 larger than any others in the series before us. 



As a rule the Catalina, Miramar and Pasadena individuals are duller 

 than specimens from the San Bernardino Mountains, Cima, Indio, 

 Providence and Bird Spring Mountains and Las Vegas. The single 

 Arden specimen has the cephalic portion of the body and limbs well 

 sprinkled and partially washed with pinkish-red. 

 Trimerotropis vinculata form similis Scudder. 



This form has rightly been reduced in rank to a variation of vincu- 

 lata by Caudell, 14 and from material before us it appears to have an 

 extensive range. 



Two males were taken on Santa Catalina Island, August 3, and a 

 single female at Miramar, July 31 . Specimens have also been examined 

 from San Diego and Claremont, California, Albuquerque, New Mexico 

 (Oslar), and El Paso, Texas (Viereck and Rehn). 



Trimerotropis fallax Saussure. 



We have before us a series of thirty-two individuals of this peculiar 

 species. The following localities are represented: Yosemite Valley, 

 4,000 to 5,400 feet, September 1, four males, four females; Sentinel, 

 Yosemite National Park, September 1, one male; Eight-Mile Camp, 

 Yosemite National Park, September 1, three females; Grouse Creek,

Yosemite National Park, September 1, five males, four females; 

 Mariposa Grove, September 2, two males, two females; Miami, Sep- 

 tember 3, one female; Ahwahnee, September 3, one male; South 

 Fork, Santa Ana River, San Bernardino Mountains, 6,200 to 6,700 feet, 

 June 28-July 24, 1906, J. Grinnell, three males, two females. 



We have mentioned the habitat and abundance of this species in 

 the notes on Trimerotropis cceruleipes. In actions this insect much 

 resembled species of Circotettix and appears to be very close to that 

 genus. It makes a distinct clatter when in flight. 



Yosemite Valley specimens are uniformly more reddish than indi- 

 viduals from the other localities, although closely approached in some 

 Mariposa Grove specimens. A number of individuals have the prono- 

 tum reddish or dull ochraceous. The coloration of the tegmina is 

 rather uniform considering the size of the series, the annular dark 

 fuscous spots being regularly distributed, a tendency to form transverse 

 bars being noted in but two specimens, these from the San Bernardino 

 Mountains. There is some variation in the depth of the yellow on 

 the disk of the wing, but the majority of the specimens are quite 

 uniform in this respect, sulphur yellow being the color found in the 

 greater number. The fuscous wing-band frequently has numerous 

 pale cellular spots distributed over it, the veins being darker than the 

 cells, but a number of individuals have the band nearly solid, and in 

 all it is well defined and decidedly indicated. The apical portion 

 of the wing is nearly uniform infumate in the series from the Yosemite 

 and adjacent regions, while it is much paler and semi-hyaline in several 

 San Bernardino Mountains specimens, although one individual from 

 the latter region is similar to the Yosemite majority. In some speci- 

 mens the pale cellular areas are also indicated in the apical region. 

 This species has been recorded from "California" and Placer County, 

 California. 

 Trimerotropis oaeruleipennis Bruner. 



This interesting species was common on Santa Catalina Island, 

 where a series of forty-seven males and thirty-two females was taken 

 on August 3 and 7. Generally speaking it frequented the steeper 

 slopes of the island. These insects were not as active as some indi- 

 viduals of the species taken a few years ago at Salt Lake City. Two 

 males were also taken in the greasewood section at Cottonwood, 

 September 9, where they were the only individuals of the species seen. 



When compared with two females from Salt Lake City, the Santa 

 Catalina Island specimens are seen to be decidedly smaller, while the 

 Cottonwood individuals are, allowing for the difference in sex, nearer

the Salt Lake representatives in size. Average individuals measure 

 as follows : 



Santa Catalina Island, Cal., 

 Cottonwood, Cal., . 

 Cottonwood, Cal., . 



Santa Catalina Island, Cal., 

 Salt Lake City, Utah, . 



The Cottonwood individuals are similar to the Salt Lake specimens in 

 general coloration, while the Santa Catalina series has, as a rule, the 

 tegminal markings duller, less contrasted and less sharply defined, 

 the whole coloration being somewhat more grizzled and less generally 

 contrasted, particularly in the female, than is the case with Great 

 Basin and Mohave Desert specimens. The color of the disk of the wing 

 varies considerably in depth, in fact from very pale greenish blue to 

 rather deep cerulean blue, while the fuscous band and spur is repre- 

 sented in some specimens by mere infuscations of the veins and in 

 others by a well-defined and rather deep cloud which falls but little 

 short of the caudal margin. The caudal tibia? exhibit a considerable 

 amount of variation in the depth of the coloration. 



This species has been recorded from localities extending from 

 Washington to Montana and Wyoming south to southern California 

 and Arizona. The previous Californian records are from Los Angeles, 

 Claremont, Santa Catalina Island and Sisson. 



Trimerotropis oyaneipennis Bruner. 



Two males and one female of this species were taken on volcanic 

 foothills of bare black rock with hardly any vegetation near the North 

 Range of the Providence Mountains, August 12. 



These individuals measure as follows : 



In general coloration the Providence Mountains specimens resemble 

 individuals from Salt Lake City, although considerably smaller. 




456 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [Oct.,. 



The wing-band is narrow in all the Calif ornian specimens, while the- 

 apex of the wing is hyaline. The color of the disk is similar to that 

 seen in specimens from the Huachuca Mountains, Arizona. 



The previous records of the species cover localities extending from 

 northern Utah to southern New Mexico and Arizona, this being the first 

 record of the species from California. The elevation at which the 

 Providence Mountains specimens were taken, 2,000 to 2,300 feet, 

 appears to be lower than any from which the species has previously 

 been recorded. The species was found to be scarce. 



Trimerotropis pseudofasoiata Scudder. 



A pair of specimens from Coronado Beach, where they were taken 

 in beach vegetation among sand dunes, August 15 and 16, are referred 

 to this species. These specimens have a distinct but rather weak 

 wing-band which reaches the caudal margin, but is hardly continued 

 at all toward the anal angle. This band is narrowly severed imme- 

 diately caudad of the spur, the latter extending nearly half the distance 

 to the base, while the apex is hyaline except for the infuscation of 

 some of the veins. 



The measurements of the Coronado Beach specimens are as follows : 



The species has been recorded from localities extending from Wash- 

 ington to southern California, east to Colorado. The specimens 

 taken were quite feeble, probably due to recent emergence. 



Circotettix shastanus Bruner. 



Three males of this species were taken on bare, almost precipitous 

 walls of rock at 4,800 feet elevation in the Yosemite Valley, September 

 1. In such locations specimens were plentiful, keeping up a constant 

 loud clattering. Owing to their vigorous flight and the character of 

 the environment they were very difficult to capture. The specimens 

 are quite uniform in coloration, though exhibiting some little individ- 

 ual variation in size, agreeing fully in all respects with Bruner's and 

 Scudder's descriptions of the species. 



Originally described from Hazel Creek, Shasta County, California, 

 the species has since been recorded by Scudder from Siskiyou, Oregon, 

 and Yosemite Valley.

Related to C. shastanus Bruner and rabula Rehn and Hebard, 

 differing from the former in the broader tegmina, the free upper 

 branch of the first subjacent radial vein and in the more deeply sulcate 

 frontal costa, while from the latter it differs in the narrower inter- 

 space between the eyes, in the more distinct wing-band and decided 

 general color pattern and in the glaucous caudal tibiae. 



Size large; form moderately robust; surface finely rugulose. Head 

 with the occiput distinctly arcuate, interocular space distinctly nar- 

 rower than the shortest diameter of the eye in both sexes, not quite 

 as high as the summits of the eyes; fastigium considerably declivent, 

 slightly longer (cT) or no longer (9) than broad, divided longitu- 

 dinally into two parts by a marked medio-longitudinal carina which 

 extends caudad becoming obsolete on the occiput, each side of the 

 fastigium independently concave in section, lateral margins moder- 

 ately elevated; lateral foveolse trigonal, elongate (cT) or subequi- 

 lateral (cJ 1 ), moderately impressed; frontal costa of moderate width,

 the greatest width, which is nearly median when the tegmen is flat- 

 tened, being equal to the length of the pronotum, the distal third of 

 the tegmina extending caudad of the apex of the abdomen; costal 

 margin with the expansion broad and low, the distal fourth decidedly 

 arcuate, the apical portion narrowed and the apical margin oblique- 

 truncate, the true apex well rounded. Wings moderately broad, the 

 width being about three-fifths of the length, the shape hardly falcate; 

 costal margin arcuate in the distal fourth; humeral field with the 

 apex well rounded acute-angulate ; axillary field with the margin

 somewhat slender, the ventral carina arcuate, sublamellate ; caudal 

 tibiae with nine to ten spines. 



General color cream strongly and conspicuously speckled with 

 numerous annular and quadrate spots of olive, becoming blackish 

 on portions of the male type. These maculations are distributed 

 roughly as follows : three transverse poorly defined and broken bars 

 on the tegmina, the median narrower than the others ; a central patch 

 on the disk of the prozona and cephalic portion of the metazona, 

 obsolete caudad; sprinklings on the occiput, gense and face; several 

 rather solid blotches on the lateral lobes of the prozona, a postocular

The special collection by the junior author was taken toward noon 

 on the shady path leading to the top of Mt. Lowe. It did not seem 

 particularly vigorous and was captured before its flight and clatter 

 could be noted. 



Anoonia integra Scudder. 



This desert-loving species was taken at three localities : Cotton- 

 wood, September 9, two males; Las Vegas, Nevada, August 10, 

 seven males, one female, one immature individual; Kelso, August 

 12, one male; Indio, July 29, seventeen males, four females. 



The series exhibits a considerable amount of individual variation 

 in size, at least in the male sex, while the color variations are exten- 

 sive as usual in the species. Specimens with green or very pale green- 

 ish in their coloration comprise half (Las Vegas) or slightly less than 

 half (Indio) of the larger lots, while the greenish individuals from both 

 of the localities are more maculate than is the case with greenish 

 individuals from Arizona. The Indio and Cottonwood individuals are 

 as a rule more uniformly maculate than the Las Vegas specimens. 

 The decussate pronotal markings are present more or less distinctly 

 in more than half the series. The Kelso individual has the entire 

 body and proximal portion of the tegmina chalky-white washed and 

 lined with pinkish-red.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[Oct., 



The range of the species is now known to extend from Las Vegas, 

 Nevada, and Death Valley, California, to Indio and Yuma, and from 

 the western portion of the Mohave Desert to at least the vicinity of 

 Tucson. 



Heliastus californicus (Thomas). 



A single female of this species taken at Pasadena, May 23, 1898, 

 by Fordyce Grinnell, Jr., has been examined. It is inseparable in 

 structure from San Diego individuals, but is decidedly different in 

 coloration, being hoary whitish with a little buff washing and marked 

 with umber, instead of being wholly deep wine-red with faint macu- 

 lations as in four individuals from the latter locality. The color adap- 

 tation of this species appears to be as great as or even greater than 

 in H. aridas. 



Heliastus aridus (Bruner). 



This species seems to make its appearance as the true deserts, both 

 Upper and Lower Sonoran, are reached, encroaching perhaps in less 

 desert-like surroundings in the San Jacinto Mountains. 



After comparing the original measurements of H. californicus and 

 aridus and examining a large series of material, although unfortunately 

 containing few californicus, it appears that several of the best characters 

 for separating the two species have been overlooked. The pronotum 

 of H. californicus is considerably more expanded laterad, and the whole 

 width of the thorax at the insertion of the median limbs is consider- 

 ably greater in proportion to the length than in aridus, while the 

 caudal femora are much slenderer and more elongate in aridus. 



The length of the tegmina, a character previously used in a diagnostic 

 sense, appears to be quite reliable, but the other differences given 

 here are probably of greater importance. 



The following measurements of individuals of californicus and 

 aridus may prove of interest :

The series examined in this connection embraces the following 

 localities: Kenworthy, San Jacinto Mountains, 5,000 feet elevation, 

 June 9, F. Grinnell, one female; Dos Palmos, Santa Rosa Mountains, 

 3,500 feet, May 26 to June 1, F. Grinnell, five females; Kelso, August 

 12, one male; Cima, August 12, two males; North Range, Providence 

 Mountains, August 12, four males, one female; foothills Bird Spring- 

 Mountains, Cal., August 11, one female; same locality in Nevada, 

 three males, one female. 



The individuals from Kenworthy and Dos Palmos are quite peculiar 

 in coloration, being shades of pale ochraceous gray with well-defined 

 brownish and blackish maculations, occasionally involving nearly 

 the whole of the disk and dorsal halves of the lateral lobes of the 

 pronotum. The other individuals are very similar in color to speci- 

 mens from the desert regions of Arizona, New Mexico and western 

 Texas. 



The previous Californian records of the species are from Panamint 

 Valley and Claremont. This latter may refer to H. californicus. 



Heliastus minimus Seudder. 



This little known species is represented by material from near the 

 foothills of the Bird Spring Mountains, both in California. and Nevada, 

 a series of seventeen males, eight females and one immature speci- 

 men being taken on August 11. Three individuals of each sex were 

 also taken the same day in Nevada, immediately over the line from 

 Lyons, California. 



All the specimens examined are distinctly, some very considerably, 

 larger than the measurements given by Scudder of typical material 

 from Palm Springs, California, but in every other respect the individuals 




462 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



before us are typical. Measurements of the extremes of the series 

 in hand are as follows : 



mm. 



Length of body, 13 



Length of pronotum, . . . 2.5 



Length of tegmen, 12.3 



Length of caudal ferum, . . . 8.9 



Specimens examined by the senior author 15 from Bill Williams Fork, 

 Arizona, were also noted as being larger than the type measurements. 



The coloration varies chiefly in the depth of the buffy base color, 

 some individuals having considerable reddish, chiefly on the proximal 

 portion of the tegmina and the disk of the metazona. The femoral 

 bars are decidedly marked in all the specimens. 



The specimens were all collected among dry grass growing in deep 

 sand near the border of a borax flat. Nowhere else was the species 

 to be found, but in this location it was plentiful. The species has a 

 quick short flight, and when resting on the sand often appears to rely 

 on its protective coloration. The situation in which the specimens 

 were taken was frightfully hot. 



The species is only known from Palm Springs, Colorado Desert, 

 California, Bill Williams Fork, Arizona, and foothills of the Bird 

 Spring Mountains, near the California-Nevada boundary. 

 Tytthotyle maoulata (Brunei-). 



This peculiar locust was taken at three localities, and in every in- 

 stance it frequented volcanic rock fragments, flying long distances, 

 somewhat like species of the genus Schistocerca, alighting precipitately 

 on the bare volcanic rocks, and almost invariably climbing upon one 

 of the higher fragments. The insects were, however, easily approached 

 when due caution was used. 



The series comprises six males and two females, taken as follows: 

 Kelso, August 12, one male; North Range, Providence Mountains, 

 August 12, one male, one female; foothills Bird Spring Mountains, 

 August 11, four males, one female, specimens being taken in both 

 California and Nevada. 



In size the specimens exhibit but slight variation, but in color the 

 prevailing tone is pinkish-brown in some specimens and drab-gray 

 in others, the maculations being variable in intensity and pattern. 

 The caudal angle of the disk of the pronotum varies from rectangulate 



15 Trans. Kansas Acad. Sci., XIX, p. 224. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 463 



to distinctly acute-angulate. The bluish cast of the wings was very 

 noticeable in flight. The previous records of the species are from 

 Needles, California, and Bill Williams Fork and Yuma, Arizona. 



Draootettix californicus Bruner. 



Four specimens apparently belonging to this species have been 

 examined in this connection. These are an adult male from Echo 

 Mountain, 2,700 to 3,500 feet, taken August 8; an adult male from 

 Hemet Peak, 7,065 feet, San Jacinto Mountains, taken June 4 by F. 

 Grinnell, Jr. ; an adult female from the South Fork of the Santa Ana, 

 6,400 feet, San Bernardino Mountains, taken July 20, 1906, by J. 

 Grinnell, and an immature female taken on Mt. Lowe, 4,300 feet, on 

 August S. In addition to these specimens typical material of the 

 allied species, D. monstrosus and plutonius, from the collection of the 

 U. S. National Museum have been examined. 



Logically D. californicus appears to be the intermediate connecting 

 the other types of the genus (plutonius and monstrosus) and at present 

 it is not clearly defined. The general form of the fastigium, shorter 

 proportionately in this than in the allied species, of the pronotal carina, 

 of the caudal femora, and the general appearance of the insect seem 

 to be the most useful points, the color of the internal face of the caudal 

 tibia? and the form of the accessory carina? on the occiput being of 

 little or no use. The material before us in addition to the above 

 listed specimens consists of the following : 



D. monstrosus, Los Angeles County, two males. San Diego, one 

 immature female. Claremont, one female. "Cal.," one female. 



D. plutonius, Panamint Valley, one male, type. Coso Valley, one 

 female, type. 



D. californicus, Claremont, one male. Mountains near Claremont, 

 one female. San Bernardino County, two males. 



Of the series of eight specimens of californicus before us, one male 

 from San Bernardino County and the San Bernardino Mountains 

 female have the internal face of the caudal tibia? uniform purplish, in 

 one male from the San Jacinto Mountains there is a trace of reddish 

 and in the remainder the red is marked, at least distad. 



The previous records of the species are from Santa Cruz Mountains, 

 Gilroy and Napa, California, and southern Arizona. 



Sohistocerca vaga (Scudder). 



A single male from Altadena, August 8, and two females from 

 Pasadena, taken April 23 and June 18, 1898, by F. Grinnell, Jr., are 

 in the series before us. 




464 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



The species has been recorded from a number of localities in southern 

 California. 



Sohistooeroa venusta Scudder. 



At Indio, on July 29, this species was very plentiful in tall weeds 

 along a watercourse, two males and three females being taken. A 

 female from an elevation of 3,000 feet in the San Gabriel Mountains, 

 taken October 9, 1908, by F. Grinnell, Jr., is also in hand. The pro- 

 notal stripe is narrower in the San Gabriel Mountains individual than 

 in the female from Indio, Avhile the specimens from the latter locality, 

 and to a lesser degree in the San Gabriel individual, are much paler 

 than Huachuca Mountains, Arizona, representatives. The species has 

 previously been recorded from Palm Springs, Indio, Tulare and Gazelle, 

 California, while specimens from San Diego and Cuyamaca, San Diego 

 County, are also before us. 



Sohistocerca shoshone (Thomas). 



Three males of this species were taken at Las Vegas, Nevada, August 

 10, where the species was found in clumps of green weeds near water. 

 The habits and habitat of this species seemed to be exactly the same 

 as those of Schistocerca venusta, but we have never found the two at 

 the same place. 



The only previous records of the species from Nevada are either 

 indefinite or from the northern section of the State (Truckee Valley). 



Hesperotettix festivus Scudder. 



At Indio this species was abundant on July 29, a series of eighteen 

 males and twenty-five females being taken. At Cottonwood, Sep- 

 tember 9, the species was found in small numbers on rabbit-weed, 

 two males and one female being taken, while a single female was secured 

 in the Arroyo Seco at Pasadena, August 1. At Las Vegas, Nevada, 

 August 10, a series of twelve males and seven females was secured. 



There is a striking amount of individual variation in size in both 

 sexes of the Indio series, but particularly in the female. Of the same 

 series, six males and six females are decidedly brownish in color or 

 show a marked tendency in that direction. Both Cottonwood males 

 are decidedly brownish, while the single female is green. All the green 

 individuals in the series have more or less distinct pinkish or pinkish- 

 red femoral annuli, the majority of the brown or brownish specimens 

 having these obsolete. The green of the Las Vegas series is pale and 

 decidedly yellowish, all from that locality being uniformly colored. 

 The Cottonwood female has a very faint bluish cast to the entire 

 tegmina. The median whitish cephalic and pronotal line is bordered 

 laterad with blackish or dark green in a number of specimens. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 465 



The only previous Calif ornian records of the species are from Los 

 Angeles County and Indio. 



iEoloplus tenuipennis Seudder. 



A single male of this species was taken at Summit House, September 

 3. The measurements — length of body 16 mm. ; length of pronotum 

 3.5; length of tegmen 13; length of caudal femur 8.3 — are slightly 

 larger than those of the type as given by Seudder. 



The record of this species from Tucson, Phoenix and Yuma, Ari- 

 zona, made in a recent publication by the authors, 16 requires correction 

 when comparison of the Summit House specimen of typical tenui- 

 pennis is made with the Tucson, Phoenix and Yuma specimens, all 

 formerly placed under that name being richly and contrastingly colored 

 individuals of M. arizonensis. 



The only previous published records of this species are from Port 

 Grant (type) and Bill Williams Fork, Arizona. 



iEoloplus arizonensis Seudder. 



This species appears to be the commonest one of the genus over a 

 considerable extent of country, ranging from southeastern Arizona 17 

 to southern Nevada and the Colorado Desert. The California and 

 Nevada series before us consists of seventy-seven specimens distributed 

 as follows: Indio, July 29, twenty-seven males, twenty-six females; 

 Cima, August 12, two females; Las Vegas, Nevada, August 10, ten 

 males, twelve females. This species exhibits a remarkable amount 

 of variation in size and considerable diversity in coloration; sometimes, 

 however, a series from one locality will be more uniform in this respect 

 than an equally large one from another region. The Las Vegas series, 

 while showing the instability of the species in these two respects, 

 averages smaller and is more uniform than the Indio series, which 

 shows great diversity in both sexes. Some have the body very pale 

 buffy without distinct markings save on the femora, while others 

 have the stripes on the head and pronotum moderately distinct, the 

 ground color varying greatly in depth. The femoral bars are dis- 

 tinct in all the specimens, but the color of the caudal tibiee may be 

 purplish (solferino, rose purple, lilac or heliotrope purple), pale glaucous, 

 a mixture of the two or some one of several tones of either. 



The Las Vegas series has rose purple or a shade of it the predominat- 

 ing color of the caudal tibiae, while the Indio series has glaucous the 

 color in all the specimens. The two Cima specimens are quite small 



16 Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phlla., 1908, p 394. 



17 See above under JE. tenuipennis. 




466 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



and dark in color, the pattern being strongly marked and the tibiae 

 purplish in color. 



In the locations where this species was captured it was found plenti- 

 ful among desert plants, excepting at Cima where individuals were 

 scarce and were found in thick thorny bushes. 



The previously published records of the species are from Fort Whip- 

 ple and Yuma, Arizona, and the Mohave Desert. 



iEoloplus oculatus Scudder. 



This interesting species, previously known only from Mohave, 

 Arizona, is represented in the series before us by six specimens, two 

 males and four females, taken at Cottonwood, September 9. The 

 prominent character of the eyes, mentioned by Scudder in his original 

 description of the species which was based on a unique male, is by no 

 means as pronounced in the female as in the male sex, although when 

 compared with females of M. arizonensis the same sex of this species 

 can be separated with little difficulty. The species is quite as variable 

 in size as most of the others of the genus, but the specimens before us 

 are quite constant in coloration. 



These insects were fairly plentiful in a low white desert bush, which 

 they would not leave and were in consequence difficult to capture. 



Melanoplus herbaceus Brunei-. 



At Indio, July 29, this species swarmed in an irrigated alfalfa field 

 and in high weeds, a series of twelve males and nine females being- 

 taken. A pair of this species was also taken on vegetation on irri- 

 gated land at Las Vegas, Nevada, August 10. This is one of the most 

 active species of the genus Melanoplus. 



The Indio males are nearly equally divided between the typical 

 form and that called flavescens by Scudder, while several specimens 

 are perfectly intermediate in character. All of the specimens are 

 in the green phase with more or less distinct postocular bars or no 

 traces of the same, except one in the brown phase and several approach- 

 ing the same. 



The species has previously been recorded from California at San 

 Diego and Indio, this constituting, however, the first Nevada record. 

 Melanoplus devastator Scudder. 



The collections made in California in 1907 contain an extensive 

 series of this very variable species, representing the following localities : 

 Mill Valley, August 23, nine males, nine females; Santa Cruz Moun- 

 tains, August 28, one male, one female; Merced, August 30, thirteen 

 males, ten females; Raymond, September 3, five males, thirteen 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 467 



females; Summit House, September 3, one male, three females; 

 Sentinel, August 31 and September 1, seventeen males, thirty-five 

 females; Pasadena (San Rafael Hills), August 1, ten males, fifteen 

 females; Altadena, August 8 and 25, six males, two females; Miramar, 

 July 31, one female; Alamitos Bay, July 31, nine males, seven females; 

 El Toro, August 20. four females; Coronado Beach, August 15, one 

 male, one female; Santa Catalina Island, August 3 and 7, three males. 



This series exhibits such a great amount of variation in size and 

 color, and to an extent in minor structural characters, that we have 

 not attempted to place the specimens in the four forms of the species 

 recognized by Scudder, as it appears probable that more than four 

 types must be recognized if all the variants are distinguished by name. 

 The desirability of doing this seems questionable, at least at the present 

 time. 



The smallest specimens in the series are from Summit House, Pasa- 

 dena and Altadena, while the largest are from El Toro, Alamitos Bay, 

 Merced and Raymond. One male and four females taken at Stanford 

 University, October 17, 1903, by Fordyce Grinnell, Jr., have also been 

 examined. 



Melanoplus aridus (Scudder). 



Three males and one female of this species were taken at Cima, 

 August 12. 



When compared with Florence, Arizona, individuals of both sexes, 

 the Cima specimens are found to agree ver} r fully in all points except 

 the position of the tegmina, these being attingent or at least sub- 

 attingent in the Arizona specimens and considerably separated in 

 the California individuals. 



This is the first record of the species from California. 



The specimens were taken in the tree yucca area where they were 

 scarce. They were found in a hilly location inhabiting the lowest 

 bushes. 



Melanoplus various Scudder. 



Four males and three females from elevations between 4,000 and 

 5,600 feet on Mt. Lowe, taken August 8 and 25, and a single female 

 from the slopes of the San Rafael Hills at Pasadena, taken August 1, 

 are provisionally referred to this species, described from specimens 

 from Tehachapi, Kern County, California, unique to this writing. 



The Mt. Lowe specimens appear to differ from the original descrip- 

 tion in having the furcula of the male hardly divergent, in fact parallel 

 in several of that sex, while the cerci appear to be slenderer at the apex 




468 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



than in the types, although of essentially the same form. The inter- 

 space between the mesosternal lobes appears to be broader and less 

 longitudinal in both sexes of the Los Angeles County material. It is 

 possible that a comparison of typical material with the series in hand 

 may make necessary their separation. 



There is a considerable amount of individual variation in size, 

 which is not at all correlated with any particular elevation. The 

 coloration is somewhat deeper in several individuals than in the others, 

 but it is quite characteristic in all. The species was not common. 



Melanoplus sonomaensis Caudell. 



A single pair of this species was taken in a garden at Santa Cruz, 

 California, August 28. The only previous record of the species is 

 that of the types from Glenellen, Sonoma County, California. 



In the garden the species was noticed to be extremely plentiful, 

 especially about the strawberry bed. 



Melanoplus gracilipes Seudder. 



A single female from Miramar, July 31, is referred to this species, 

 which was previously known only from Los Angeles. The individual 

 was taken near the shore, along the border of a field of dry trampled 

 grass. Further extensive search failed to reveal any other specimens. 



Melanoplus pacificus (Seudder). 



An interesting series of twenty specimens of this species were col- 

 lected in the Yosemite National Park, between 4,000 and 6,000 feet 

 elevation, at the following localities: Yosemite Valley, 4,100 to 4,500 

 feet, September 1, two males, one female; Sentinel, August 31, two 

 males, six females; Eight-Mile Camp, September 1, one male, four 

 females; Grouse Creek, September 1, one male, one female. 



When compared with a pair of this species from Sissonsand Dunsmuir, 

 Siskiyou County, California, the Yosemite males have the caudal 

 margins of the cerci more thickened and terminating rather abruptly 

 about two-thirds the distance from the base, the apical third being 

 equally slender in males from both localities. A single male in the 

 Academy collection from the Yosemite Valley, date and collector 

 unknown, fully agrees with the larger series in the above mentioned 

 character. 



The coloration shows little variation except in the depth of the light 

 and dark colors, most of the palest individuals being from Sentinel. The 

 postocular bar is strongly marked in all the males and a number of 

 the females, being distinctly or hardly indicated in the remainder of 

 the latter sex. In several females the postocular bar is represented 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 469 



only by a very narrow and broken line bordering the ventral side of 

 the lateral carina?. In size there is considerable individual variation, 

 females from Eight-Mile Camp alone showing five millimeters differ- 

 ence in the length of the body. 



At Sentinel the specimens were all captured in a small area of herbs 

 beside the Merced River, while at Eight-Mile Camp and Grouse Creek 

 the specimens were taken in a forest of conifers. The insects were 

 active but heavy and easily captured, although the series taken at 

 Sentinel was secured only after long and continued search. 



The previous records of the species are from Dunsmuir, Edgewood, 

 Mt. Shasta and Sissons, Siskiyou County, Shasta County, Santa Cruz 

 Mountains, and mountains near Lake Tahoe. California. 



Melanoplus borckii (St&l). 



One male and two females of this species were taken on Mt. Tamal- 

 pais, August 23, one female at 1,500 feet elevation, the other individuals 

 at 2,100 feet. The former specimen was found along the railroad 

 track, while the latter were on the ground among huckleberry bushes. 

 The individual from 1,500 feet elevation has a most peculiar coloration, 

 the general tone of the insect being brownish black with a rather broad 

 arcuate bar of coral-red crossing the dorsal portion of the lateral lobes 

 of the pronotum. The ridge of the metathoracic episterna is yellow- 

 ish as in normally colored specimens, while the dorsal face of the 

 caudal femora is ochraceous-rufous, blackish proximad and distadwith 

 the median bar indicated on the internal half. 



The only exact localities from which this species has been recorded 

 are in the coast region of California between Sonoma County and 

 Los Angeles. 



Melanoplus tenuipennis Scurlder. 



Four adult and one nearly mature female taken between June 

 2S and July 20, 1906, at elevations of from 6,200 to 6,400 feet, on the 

 South Fork of the Santa Ana River, in the San Bernardino Mountains, 

 by Dr. Joseph Grinnell, are now before us. They agree quite well with 

 Scudder's description of the species, which is very close to M. mis- 

 sionum. The coloration is fairfy constant except for the ventral 

 extension on the prozonal lobes of the blackish postocular line, as well 

 as the variable character of the lateral face of the caudal femora. 

 The latter may be nearly solid blackish, yellowish-green darkened 

 distad and dorsad or faintly oblique fasciate. Very w T eak pregen- 

 icular annuli are present in one individual. 



The species has been recorded from Guadelupe and Los Angeles, 




470 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



and Monterey, Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Kern Counties, 



California. 



Melanoplus missionum 18 Scudder. 



A series of seventeen specimens of this species are in the collection 

 before us, all taken in a comparative small area. The localities repre- 

 sented are the following: Arroyo Seco at Pasadena, one male, July 

 20, F. Grinnell, Jr., one female, August 1 ; Arroyo Seco, San Gabriel 

 Mountains, elevation 3,000 feet, October 8, F. Grinnell, Jr.; Altadena, 

 August 8, one male; Mt. Lowe, 4,000 to 5,600 feet, August 8, six 

 males, seven females. There is considerable individual variation 

 in size, specimens from the highest elevation on Mt. Lowe showing 

 the following extremes : 



& 

 mm. 



Length of body, 15.8 



Length of pronotum, . . . . 4.2 



Length of tegmen, 3.2 



Length of caudal femur, . . . . 10 . 2 



The exposed portion of the tegmina varies considerably in length, 

 in one case hardly more than half the average exposed area being- 

 visible. The general coloration shows considerable variation, ranging 

 from quite uniform greenish yellow to dull olive and ochraceous-buff 

 and vandyke-brown. The last mentioned type predominates, the 

 females, however, being much duller than the males. The yellow 

 type is represented by one female from 3,000 feet elevation in the 

 Arroyo Seco, while the single olive specimen is from the Arroyo Seco 

 at Pasadena. The yellowish postocular line is distinct in the majority 

 of the specimens and faintly indicated in the remainder. The femoral 

 bars are distinct in all the males and faintly indicated in all the females 

 except the greenish-yellow specimen, which also has the caudal tibia? 

 yellowish externally and glaucous internally instead of nearly uniform 

 glaucous as in the others. A more or less distinct yellowish pregen- 

 icular annulus is present in the majority of the series. 



Specimens were never taken in numbers, but single individuals 

 were occasionally noticed. 



The only previous record of the species is from Los Angeles. This 

 reference probably should stand as Los Angeles County. 

 Melanoplus fuscipes Scudder. 



Two females of this species were taken in the San Gabriel Range 



18 The senior author's (Edqleonotus truncatus (Ent. News, XVIII, p. 353) from 

 the San Gabriel range near Claremont, California, is a synonym of this species. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 471 



on August 8, one at an elevation of 4,400 feet on Mt. Lowe, the other 

 in Rubio Canyon, between 2,200 and 3,000 feet. 



The specimens, while quite similar in coloration except for a rufous 

 tone to the lighter color of the large individual, show considerable 

 individual variation in size, the measurements being as follows: 



Length of Length of Length of Length of 

 body. pronotum. tegmen. caudal femur. 



mm. mm. mm. mm. 



Rubio Canyon, . ... 18.5 4 3.5 10 



Mt. Lowe, 22 5.5 4.5 12 



The previous records of this species are from localities along the 

 coast and coastal valleys of southern California, from between Luis 

 Obispo and San Simeon Bay south to San Diego County and at least 

 as far east as Claremont. The species has also been recorded from 

 San Bernardino County, but from which portion of that quite diverse 

 area is not mentioned. 



In habitat and actions these specimens greatly resembled Melano- 

 plus missionum. 



Melanoplus ablutus Scudder. 



A single male of this species was taken at El Portal, August 30, 

 at an elevation of 2,050 feet on a steep mountain side, among dry 

 leaves, under manzanita and other bushes. The specimen was taken 

 at daybreak, and no other Orthoptera were noted at that time. 



The antennae of this individual are quite short, not quite four milli- 

 meters long and slightly less than half the length of the caudal femur, 

 the tips being perfect and unbroken. In the type measurements 

 Scudder gives the length of these appendages as six and one-half 

 millimeters or more than two-thirds the femoral length. In every 

 other character the specimen in hand is perfectly typical. The type 

 locality is Wawona, Mariposa County, California. 

 Melanoplus nanus Scudder. 



One male and two females of this species, taken at Mill Valley, 

 August 23, are in the series. They are closely related to the following 

 species and require considerable study for their proper separation. 

 The shorter and apically broader cerci and more divergent furcula are 

 of the greatest comparative value. 



The species was found on a dry grassy hillside. 



The original and only previously published records of the species 

 are from Mill Valley, San Francisco, Berkeley and^Baden, San Mateo 

 County, California. 




472 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



Melanoplus ligneolus Scudder. 



Two males and a single female of this species were taken at 2,100 

 feet elevation on Mt. Tamalpais, among low bushes. 



Both this and the preceding species were extremely scarce. 

 The previous records are from Berkeley and Benicia, California. 



Melanoplus cinereus Scudder. 



An interesting series of thirty-three specimens of this species from 

 the following localities is contained in the collection : Sentinel, August 

 31, one male; Pasadena, August 1, nine males; Altadena, August 8, 

 one male, one female; Rubio Canyon, 2,200 to 3,000 feet, August 8, 

 three males; Alamitos Bay, July 31, four males, one female; Coronado 

 and South Coronado Beach, August 16, five males, one female; Tia 

 Juana, August 16, three males, one female; Santa Catalina Island, 

 August 7, two males, one female. 



The series exhibits a surprising amount of variation in size, this 

 being to a great extent individual, but in a measure apparently due to 

 geographic factors. Average males from the localities represented 

 measure as follows: 



Sentinel, . 



Pasadena, 



Altadena, 



Rubio Canyon, 



Alamitos Bay, 



Coronado Beach, 



Tia Juana, 



Santa Catalina Island 



16.5 " 13.5 " 10 



The cerci and furcula show a number of modifications of the essential 

 type of the species, but none of the specimens are typical of the closely 

 related M. cyanipes, although this is approached by certain individuals. 

 The coloration varies considerably, the Sentinel, Pasadena, Altadena 

 and Rubio Canyon series being darker than the Coronado Beach and 

 Tia Juana specimens, while the Alamitos Bay and Santa Catalina 

 Island individuals are nearly intermediate, although nearer the dark 

 type. The Tia Juana and Coronado Beach females are very pale, 

 as is also the case with one male from the latter locality. 



This is essentially a species of the drier sections, and although a 

 common species it was never found to be gregarious. 



Melanoplus oomplanatipes Scudder. 



Three males and one female from Cottonwood, September 9, and 




1909.] 



NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



473 



one female from the foothills of the Bird Spring Mountains, Nevada, 

 August 11, are inseparable from this species, previously known only from 

 Cape San Lucas, Lower California, and Sonora, Mexico. 



The appendages of the males are identical with Scudder's figure, 

 but it would seem as if the typical material was shrunken from immer- 

 sion in spirits, as Scudder states the figured male "is . . . . some- 

 what distorted by preservation in spirits," and the same medium 

 has apparently rendered some points of the coloration obscure. The 

 dimensions of a Cottonwood pair and the Nevada female are as follows : 



Cottonwood, d? 21 



Cottonwood, 9 25.5 



Foothills Bird Spring Mountains, 9 27 



The postocular bar is faint in one specimen and distinctly marked 

 in the others, while the entire dorsum, except for a pair of narrow 

 lateral more or less distinct yellowish carinal lines, is sprinkled and 

 clouded with umber. The caudal femora bear traces of transverse 

 bars, in fact quite distinct ones dorsad, while the ventral and internal 

 faces of the same portions are orange or orange- red. The caudal 

 tibiae are glaucous, varying from very pale to quite deep in shade. 



This was one of the extremely vigorous and scarcer desert species. 

 In habits it closely resembled Melanoplus bowditchii, being quite 

 as active and shy. 



Melanoplus marginatus form pauper Scudder. 



At Ahwahnee, September 3, this interesting insect was found com- 

 mon in a rank growth of high tarweed, a series of six males and seven 

 females being taken. 



Considerable individual variation in size is exhibited by these speci- 



mens, the extremes being as follows: 



Length of body, . 

 Length of pronotum, 

 Length of tegmen, 

 Length of caudal femur,

In general coloration some specimens are distinctly darker than 

 others, but the pattern is essentially the same in all the series.

474 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



The species has previously been recorded from Natoma Vineyard, 

 Folsom, Atwater, Fort Tejon, Chico, Guadelupe and southern Cali- 

 fornia. 



Melanoplus femoratus (Burmeister). 



This species was found in numbers at both Sentinel, August 31 and 

 September 1, and Mariposa Grove, September 2, ten males and nine 

 females being taken at the former locality and seven males and two 

 females at the latter. 



The specimens average decidedly smaller than individuals from the 

 eastern United States, while the amount of contrast of the yellow 

 postocular bars and of the ventral half of the caudal femora is quite 

 variable, several of the males being very strikingly colored. 



The previous Calif ornian records of the species were from Mt. 

 Shasta district and Los Angeles. This latter record is probably 

 meant to cover the entire county, as it is hardly possible that this 

 species could be found in the vicinity of Los Angeles. 



TETTIGONID^]. 

 Hormilia elegans Scudder. 



Three adult males and four immature individuals of this species 

 were taken from greasewood at Cottonwood, September 9. The 

 specimens were found only by long and constant search. They flew 

 from one greasewood bush to another, but were easily approached 

 and captured, apparently relying on their coloration for protection. 

 These individuals possess strongly contrasted maculations, the base 

 green being deep in two males, while the. third has the dorsal section 

 of the tegmina blackish-brown, the white spots, which are decided, 

 distinctly outlined and regularly placed, being washed with pale 

 greenish in one individual. The darker portions of the limbs are 

 olive-brown in the male with blackish-brown on the tegmina. In 

 size the Cottonwood adults are about equal to specimens from Florence, 

 Arizona. 



This is the first record of the species from California. 



Seudderia mexicana (Saussure). 



Three California males of this species have been examined, one from 

 Avalon, Santa Catalina Island, taken August 7 by Hebard, another 

 from Pasadena, taken July 28, 1899, by F. Grinnell, Jr., and a third 

 from Santa Monica, taken August 1, 1906, by the same collector. 



The previous Californian records of the species were from Los 

 Angeles, Coronado and Claremont. The single specimen from Avalon 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 475 



was found in the afternoon, resting on a frond of a palm growing in a 

 garden. 



Scudderia furcata Brunner. 



A single male of this species was taken at Ahwahnee, September 3. 

 This is the most southern record for California. The insect was taken 

 in a rank growth of tarweed. 



Conocephalus 19 spinosus (Morse). 



Three males and one female of this species were taken on salt 

 marsh vegetation at South Coronado Beach, August 16. In life the 

 specimens were deep green in color. The species was described from 

 Coronado, and has not been reported from elsewhere. At the time 

 these specimens were taken adults were extremely scarce. 



Conocephalus occidentalis (Morse). 



In a meadow of deep rank grass at Sentinel, Yosemite Park, August 

 31, five males and five females of this species were taken. At Mari- 

 posa Grove, September 2, three males and seven females were also 

 taken, while at Mill Valley, August 23, two females were secured in a 

 dry ditch. The females exhibit considerable diversity in the length 

 of the ovipositor, the extremes, however, being well within those given 

 by Morse, while the wings do not quite reach the apex of the abdomen 

 in any of the males and range from one-half to three-fourths the length 

 of the abdomen in the females. 



One of the specimens taken at Mill Valley was caught ovipositing 

 in a grass straw. 

 Conocephalus vicinus (Morse). 



Two males of this species were taken among grasses on sand dunes 

 directly back of the ocean beach at Alamitos Bay, July 31. 



Neduba convexa Caudell. 



Four males of this form were taken at 2,100 feet elevation on Mt. 

 Tamalpais, on ground covered with leaves and bark. They w r ere very 

 quiet and when found could be picked up easily. One specimen is 

 slightly smaller than the original measurements, the other three, 

 however, being almost identical with the type male in dimensions. 



The color form of the type male, viz., "light yellowish-brown," is 

 not represented in the four specimens before us, two of these being 

 red-brown and the others umber-brow r n. The abdominal pattern 

 found in N. carinata is marked in the tw 7 o red-brown males, hardly

indicated in one of the brown males and no traces are present in the 

 other. The lateral lobes of the pronotum are blackish-brown in all 

 the specimens, but this is more extensive cephalo-ventrad in some 

 than in others. 



After comparison of the genitalia of this form with the figures of 

 that of N. carinata we are forced to the conclusion that specific rank 

 must be accorded convexa. 



The type localities were Mt. Shasta and Napa County, California.

Related to A. diabolicus (Scudder) from Monte Diablo, California, but 

 differing in the somewhat shorter caudal femora, which are much less 

 inflated proximad, and in the more decidedly and sharply dentate 

 apex of the ovipositor. No doubt other differences exist in the male 

 sex, but this cannot be determined until the male of A* diabolicus is 

 known.

 teen and those of the ventral margin about half that number; sub- 

 genital plate of the female moderately produced, subtrigonal, strongly 

 arcuate in section, the apical margin obtuse. Prosternum armed 

 with a pair of moderately long spines. Cephalic femora about two- 

 thirds the dorsal length of the pronotum, moderately robust, the dor- 

 sal face armed with two spines cephalad and three to four caudad, 

 the ventral margins unarmed, the cephalic genicular lobe with a single 

 spine, the caudal unarmed; cephalic tibiae very slightly longer than 

 the femora, the dorsal face with two spines, one tympanal, the other 

 apical, the ventral margins each with seven spines. Median femora 

 slightly longer than the cephalic femora, the dorsal face armed with 

 six spines in the male, one being apical, a smaller number present 

 in the female, ventral margins unarmed; median tibiae slightly longer 

 than the femora, armed dorsad with three spines on the cephalic margin 

 and five on the caudal, ventral margins each armed with eight spines. 

 Caudal femora nearly two and one-half times the length of the prono- 

 tum, quite robust proximad, the distal third slender and subequal, 

 the dorsal face of the inflated proximal section with numerous fine de- 

 pressed spines, ventral margins unarmed; caudal tibiae slightly shorter 

 than the femora; free plantula present in the caudal tarsi. 



General colors of the male buff dorsad, clay color laterad and ventrad, 

 of the female dull chocolate-brown. The face, greater portion of the 

 lateral lobes of the pronotum, abdominal bars and annuli and clouds 

 on the limbs shining seal-brown. The two proximal joints of the anten- 

 nae are blackish beneath, while the remainder of the antennae are 

 regularly annulate with buff and seal-brown, the buff annuli distinctly 

 narrower than the seal-brown ones, the latter regularly increasing 

 in length distad. Eyes hazel-brown. A bar on the ventro-cauclal 

 portion of the lateral lobes of the pronotum of the lighter general 

 color of the respective sexes, while the caudal margin of the disk of 

 the pronotum is narrowly checked with the darker color. The main 

 abdominal pattern consists of lateral bars becoming evanescent 

 laterad, broad and parallel on the three proximal exposed segments, 

 on the next two segments- arching laterad and returning to nearly the 

 same degree of separation distad as proximad, the bars at the expan- 

 sion and caudad of the same much weaker than cephalad. Male 

 genitalia chestnut; ovipositor of the general colors mottled. Caudal 

 femora marbled on the dorsal aspect, a conspicuous medio-longitudinal 

 line, more or less undulate in character, of seal-brown present on the 

 lateral face and extending the length of the inflated portion.

A paratypic male from Yosemite Valley and another of the same 

 sex from Wawona, taken September 1, have been examined in addition 

 to the types. The paratypic male is slightly larger than the type male 

 and has the pale general . color darker, more vinaceous-cinnamon, 

 while the Wawona specimen is similar to the type in size and is almost 

 uniform pale cinnamon in color, the seal-brown limited to the femoral 

 line and scattered clouds, spots and points, the pronotum being prac- 

 tically uniform except for the beading on the caudal margins. The 

 antennae are similar in pattern in all the specimens. 



The two specimens taken in the Yosemite Valley were captured 

 during the morning, hiding in the cracks in the bark of some tall fir 

 trees. They were quiescent, apparently resting for the day. The 

 individual taken at Grouse Creek was found on a steep hillside, 

 among a very few low green plants growing in a conifer forest. The 

 insect jumped about actively, but only for short distances. The 

 Wawona representative was taken from the stem of a small shrub, 

 where it was stridulating at dusk. Other specimens were heard 

 in the forest, usually in low trees. The stridulation is remarkably 

 faint for so large an insect, the sound produced being a weak zip- 

 zip-zeeeeee repeated several times, reminding one strongly of the 

 stridulation of Orchelimum minor. 



Cyrtophyllicus chlorum Hebard. 2 ° 



The type of this recently described genus and species, taken at El 

 Portal, August 30, is contained in the collection. 



The original association of the genus with Zacycloptera Caudell 

 is correct, although the number of apical spurs on the caudal tibiae 

 was there stated in a way liable to confuse, the number of one side 

 of the tibiae or of pairs being given and not the total for the limb. 

 Aiioplodusa arizonensis (Rehn). 



On August 11, while crossing the volcanic flats overgrown with 

 greasewood at the foot of the Bird Spring Mountains of the McCol-

lough range, on the Nevada side of the California boundary line, a 

 specimen of this very rare species was flushed from a greasewood 

 bush. It flew up in a way reminding one of the swift flight of a Schisto- 

 cerca and did not alight for at least two hundred yards, when it 

 perched on the top of another greasewood bush. The specimen was 

 captured and proved to be the first known female of the genus. When 

 compared with the male type of the species the Nevada specimen 

 does not appear to be separable, such differences as do exist, as larger 

 size and slightly different proportionate width of the fastigium, being 

 easily attributable to sexual differences. The ovipositor curves 

 distinctly but not at all decidedly ventrad, the apex being acute and 

 the margins not spined. The measurements are as follows: 



Length of body (exclusive of ovipositor), 25.5 mm. 



Length of pronotum, 7.2 



Width of pronotum (caudad), 4.5

The coloration is much paler than in the type, although the pattern 

 is essentially the same, all the paler spots and markings on the prono- 

 tum and tegmina being ivory white and the remainder of the surface 

 pale yellowish buff, becoming yellowish on the distal portions of the 

 femora and on the tibiae, the darker portions of the tegmina being 

 brownish-clay color becoming paler distad. The line pattern on the 

 pronotum is essentially the same as and more distinct than in the type, 

 while no green is present on the specimen. 



The type locality and only previously published record of the species 

 is Florence, Arizona. 



Eremopedes gracilis (Rehn). 



An adult pair of this form was taken at Cottonwood, September 9, 

 frequenting low growth, where they were much protected by their 

 coloration. The tegmina of the male, projecting two and one-half 

 millimeters beyond the pronotum, are considerably convex with the 

 internal margin of the apex obliquely arcuate, the external margin 

 straight with the apex rounded subtruncate, the tympanum being 

 almost entirely hidden. The ovipositor of the female is slightly 

 shorter than the length of the caudal femora, while the tegmina are 

 minute pads, well hidden under the pronotum. 



The terminal dorsad abdominal segment of the male is deeply and 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 481 



acutely fissate mesad with a pair of acute finger-like lobes bordering 

 the same. The supra-anal plate, which is visible ventrad of the 

 incision of the abdominal segment, is acute-angulate. The cerci 

 are slender, tapering, nearly straight, the apical portion substyli- 

 form, the apex rather blunted, the usual tooth on the internal margin 

 is hidden by the supra-anal plate when the cerci are together. The 

 subgenital plate has a small median rectangulate emargination, the 

 styles being extremely short. 



The measurements of the two specimens are as follows: 



Length of body, 22 mm. 21 mm. 



Length of pronotum, 5.5 " 5 " 



Greatest caudal width of pronotum, . 3.5 " 3.8 " 



Length of exposed tegmen, 2.5 " 



Length of caudal femur, 18.5 " 20.5 " 



Length of ovipositor, 19.5 " 



It is seldom that one can take exception to any portion of the excel- 

 lent work of Caudell in his study of the North American Decticinse, 

 but to his assignment of this name to the synonymy 21 we are compelled 

 to disagree. No actual comparison was made, as far as we can learn, 

 of Scudder's type of E. albofasciata and that of gracilis, and specimens 

 examined at different times may be considered the same when real 

 differences exist. The characters given by Rehn for separating 

 gracilis from albofasciata hold true in the material before us, and as 

 far as memory serves the type of gracilis was similar to the one in 

 hand, which is undoubtedly adult, although Caudell assumed it to be 

 immature. The bars on the head, pronotum and abdomen are broader 

 in this form than in a number of New Mexican immature individuals 

 of albofasciata, the size is less than that of Scudder's type and the caudal 

 femora appear to be slenderer ana are considerably longer in proportion 

 to the ovipositor. The immature specimen from Phoenix, Arizona, 

 which Caudell says is similar to the type of gracilis, is probably the same 

 as the Cottonwood specimens, as it is quite probable that one form is 

 limited to the Eastern Desert or Chihuahuan Tract and the other to 

 the Western Desert or Sonoran Tract. 



The type locality of E. gracilis is Bill Williams Fork, Arizona. 



Idiostatus sequalis Scudder. 



A single female of this species was taken in the Arroyo Seco at 

 Pasadena, August 1, while two males, one adult and the other not 



2l Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., XXXII, p. 339.

quite mature, taken at 6,000 to 6,500 feet elevation in Strawberry 

 Valley, San Jacinto Mountains, July 17, by F. Grinnell, Jr., have also 

 been examined. The Arroyo Seco specimen was beaten from low 

 bushes. 



Clinopleura minuta Caudell, 



At Raymond, on September 3, this species was found swarming, 

 invariably on the ground, especially in a stubble field. The insects 

 jumped farther than any species of North American Orthoptera taken 

 by us, but owing to their tremendous numbers a large series was 

 easily secured. A series of fourteen males and thirty-one females 

 was taken at this locality, a single female also being secured at Summit 

 House the same date in a situation similar to that frequented at Ray- 

 mond. The series contains several females winch slightly exceed 

 Caudell's maximum measurements for the caudal femur and ovipositor. 

 There is considerable variation in the general shade of coloration in 

 the series, some individuals being decidedly more testaceous than 

 others, the usual dark area on the lateral lobes of the pronotum being 

 hardly or only partially indicated in some of the pale specimens. 

 The previous records of the species were from Ahwahnee, Calaveras 

 and Raymond, California. 



GRYLLID^i. 

 Ellipes minuta (Scudder). 



A single individual of this species was taken along the nearly dry 

 bed of the Mohave River at Cottonwood, September 9. Although 

 considerable beating was done but one specimen was found. 



The species has been taken at Palm Springs, San Bernardino and 

 Ahwahnee, California. 



Ectatoderus occidentalis (Scudder) ? 



A single male individual of this genus was taken at Cottonwood, 

 September 9. We have assigned it provisionally to this species, 

 originally described from damaged female specimens taken at Cape 

 San Lucas, Lower California. The original description of Scudder's 

 species is so brief and the sex differences of many species of this genus 

 so great, that in the absence of females the determination is not at 

 all positive. No relationship exists with E. borealis Scudder, known 

 from California and New Mexico, the produced pronotum of the 

 Cottonwood male suggesting that of Liphoplus mexicanus Saussure, 22 

 but the tegmina are much shorter, rather different in character and the 

 facial scutellum is not distinctly divided.

1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 483 



The measurements of the specimen are as follows : Length of body 

 7.2 mm.; length of pronotum 3.2; greatest width of pronotum 2.8; 

 length of tegmina caudad of pronotum 1.5; length of caudal femur 4 . 3. 



At dusk and later, this insect was heard on every side stridulating. 

 It was found that the musicians were hidden at the roots of greasewood 

 bushes where they were almost inaccessible. The single specimen was 

 captured by suddenly pulling a small bush up by the roots, and luckily 

 turning the insect out of his home. The stridulation was similar to 

 that of the genus Gryllus but shriller, an incessant zeee-zeee-zeee. 

 This ceased upon approach, even when the disturber was yards distant. 



Nemobius mormonius Scudder. 



Two males and one female of this species were taken from grass 

 beside a stream at Las Vegas, Nevada, August 10. The species was 

 rather well distributed in this situation. 



Miogryllus lineatus (Scudder). 



Two males of this species were taken at Las Vegas, Nevada, August 9, 

 on an ore pile, where a colony of these were chirping incessantly. 

 The type of the species was taken between Virgin River and Fort 

 Mohave, Arizona. 



(Ecanthus niveus (DeGeer). 



A single male of this species was taken on geraniums after dark, 

 August 3, on Santa Catalina Island. Three females from Stanford 

 University, California, taken October 3 to 23, 1903, by F. Grinnell, 

 Jr., have also been examined. 



(Ecanthus californicus Saussurc. 



A single male from El Portal, taken August 30, and a female from 

 Mt. Wilson, 5,000 feet elevation, San Gabriel Mountains, taken Sep- 

 tember 19 by F. Grinnell, Jr., belong to this species. The general 

 color is pale ochraceous in the male and olive-green in the female, 

 the male having the head, except the mouth parts, and dots on the 

 pronotum red, the first and second joints of the antennae are also red- 

 dish but duller, while the third to seventh or eighth are dark brownish 

 fading distad. The female bears no red except a wash of red-brown 

 on the two proximal antennal segments, the brownish area on the 

 antennae found in the male being present in the female as well. The 

 El Portal specimen was taken at night in a tangle of bushes by means 

 of a lantern.

NOTES ON THE FLORA OF THE BERMUDAS. 



BY STEWARDSON BROWN. 



The present flora of the Bermudas, aside from the plants known 

 to have been introduced through the agency of man, probably num- 

 bers about two hundred species, of which thirteen vascular forms are 

 endemic, and has undoubtedly been derived through the usual agencies 

 producing insular floras. On the stretches of sandy beach the same 

 species are met with as characterize similar locations in the West 

 Indies or Florida: Ipomcca pes-capro3 (L.) Sweet, Canavalia obtusifolia 

 (L.) D. C, Sesuvium portulacastrumL., Croton punctatus Jacq., Scccvola 

 Plumieri (L.) Vahl. and Cakile lanceolata (Willd.) 0. E. Schultz, while 

 on the rocky shores are Borrichia arborescens (L.) DC, B. frutescens 

 (L.) DC, Chamcesyce buxifolia (Lam.) Small, and the two characteristic 

 shrubs Suriana maritima L. and Tournefortia gnaphalodes (L.) R. Br. 

 On the shores of the quiet bays and lagoons the mangrove Rhizo- 

 phora mangle L. and Avicennia nitida Jacq. are the dominant species, 

 while in the marshes Osmunda spectabilis Willd., 0. cinnamomea L., 

 Pteridium caudatum (L.) Maxon, Cladium jamaicense Crantz, Eleo- 

 charis interstincta (Vahl.) R. and S., Kyllinga brevifolia Rottb., Typha 

 angustifolia L., Myrica cerifera L. and B acchar is glomeruli} olia Pers. 

 are more or less generally distributed. The plants of the higher 

 ground seem more restricted in their distribution for the most part. 

 Dodonosa angustifolia Sw. is generally distributed through the hills, 

 Randia aculeata L. is known only on the Paget Sand Hills, while the 

 following are found almost exclusively in the Walsingham Tract: 

 Adelia segregata (Jacq.) Kuntze. Psychotria undata Jacq., Trema 

 Lamarkiana (R. and S.) Blume, Eugenia monticola D. C and Zanthoxy- 

 lum flavum Vahl., the last known only from two trees, one on a hill 

 east of Paynter's Vale (B. and B., No. 357, 1905), with several young 

 ones surrounding it, and the other discovered by the writer in one of 

 the sinkholes near the caves at Walsingham. These, so far as known, 

 are all that survive of the "yellow-wood" of the islands, referred to 

 by early writers as growing in such abundance. 



With the exception of the cedar (Juniperus bermudiana L.), which 

 is very abundant in the islands, by far the commonest plants to-day 

 are those introduced by man. A number of weeds on the roadsides 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 487 



and in the "gardens" and others which do not belong to this class, 

 but have been introduced for their beauty or utility and are now so 

 thoroughly naturalized as to have become an integral part of the 

 flora. Among these plants the most abundant is the common sage, 

 Lantana involucrata L., said to have been introduced from the Bahamas 

 more than a century ago as a fuel, to take the place of the cedar which 

 was being extensively used for lime burning. It is now so general 

 throughout the islands that were it not known to be an introduction 

 it might easily be mistaken for a native plant. Lantana camara L., 

 introduced as a garden flower from Madeira in 1819, is as generally 

 distributed though not quite as abundant, and when in flower is one 

 of the striking plants of the roads and hillsides. The fiddlewood, 

 Citharexylon quadrangulare Jacq., introduced at Paynter's Vale in 

 1830 by Archdeacon Spencer, is now abundant everywhere on the 

 main island, having spread from the original tree, which is still stand- 

 ing. Another of Archdeacon Spencer's introductions at Paynter's 

 Vale in 1840 was the myrtle, Jasminum simplici folium Forst, which 

 now festoons the trees and rocks, forming almost impenetrable tangles 

 throughout the Walsingham Tract, where it has become a great 

 nuisance by smothering many of the more desirable plants, especially 

 the cedar. Without doubt the birds have played an important part 

 in the spread of these four species through the islands, as all bear a 

 profusion of berries. Other introductions are prominent features 

 in the vegetation of the islands, but two of the most striking which 

 are integral parts of the flora are the oleander, Nerium oleander 

 L., introduced in 1790 as a rare exotic and now planted extensively 

 for hedges and windbreaks, which is naturalized on the hillsides, 

 and while in flower during the summer months is a gorgeous display 

 of color, and the Life Plant of the Bermudians, Bryophyllum pinnd- 

 tum (Lam.) S. Kurz, introduced as a curiosity in 1813 and now abun- 

 dant everywhere on the roadsides and in the woods, when flowering 

 during the winter months, is hardly less a feature than the oleander. 



In 1905, the writer, in company with Dr. and Mrs. Nathaniel Lord 

 Britton, of the New York Botanical Garden, visited the islands between 

 August 31 and September 20, when a collection of more than four 

 hundred species was made, principally in the several marshes and in 

 the Walsingham Tract. The writer made two subsequent visits to 

 the islands, 1 from February 10 to March 9, 1908, and May 22 to June 



1 Investigation prosecuted with the aid of a grant from the Esther Herrman 

 Fund of the New York Academy of Sciences.

2, 1909, when collections of more than three hundred species were 

 made, a majority of which were not included in the former gatherings. 

 In the present paper, which is based on the observations and collec- 

 tions made during these several visits, only the endemic species among 

 the flowering plants are considered, together with such as have been 

 added to the hitherto published lists. 



Juniperus bermudiana L. 



B. and B., No. 1, September, 1905. Mt. Langdon, north shore. 



The most abundant tree, growing everywhere throughout the islands, 

 in dry and rocky ground as well as in the marshes. At the time of 

 flowering during March and early April the staminate trees are a 

 golden color, presenting a striking contrast with the rich blue-green 

 of the pistilate trees. 



Thalassia testudinum Koenig & Sims. 



B. and B., No. 185, September, 1905. Spanish Point and Hungry 

 Bay. Found abundantly in all the shallow bays, and is probably the 

 basis for the record of Zostera marina L. of the lists, as that species 

 was nowhere observed.

 Marsh, S. B.. No. 698, 1909. Middle Road. Frequent on the road- 

 sides throughout the islands.

Hordeum pusillum Nutt. 



S. B., No. 695, May, 1909. St. David's Island. Abundant on the

 Cyperus alternifolius L. 



S. B., No. 578, March, 1908. Marsh near Tuckers Town. S. B., 

 No. 726, June, 1909. Pembroke Marsh. Although undoubtedly an 

 escape from cultivation, it is thoroughly naturalized and spreading 

 in the localities noted.

Carex bermudiana Hemsley. 



B. and B., No. 224, September, 1905. S. B., No. 649, March, 1908. 

 Paget Marsh. At the time of the preparation of the "Challenger" 

 report, this interesting species was known only from a specimen in 

 the Sloan Herbarium at the British Museum, and as no subsequent 

 collections had been made up to that time, Prof. Hemsley expressed 

 some doubt as to whether the species described by him was really 

 collected in the islands. Our rediscovery of it in September, 1905, at 

 what is likely to be the original locality in Paget Marsh, settles the 

 correctness of Sloan's label beyond a doubt. The species appears 

 restricted at the present time to this one locality, where, however, 

 it is growing in some abundance. 

 Carex albolutescens Schwein. 



S. B., No. 702, May, 1909. Eastern end of Devonshire Marsh. 

 Abundant. Not observed elsewhere. 

 Sabal Blackbumiana Glasebrook. 



B. and B., No. 217, September, 1905. Throughout the islands, 

 but varying considerably in appearance according to situations.

490 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Nov., 



On the dry exposed hillsides it is more or less dwarfed and of a yellowish 

 color, while in moist rich ground and the marshes it is a handsome tree 

 with rich green foliage. It is recorded as at one time an abundant tree, 

 forming extensive groves, but it is now found for the most part only 

 in the lawns where it has been preserved. The finest natural grove 

 observed by us is in Paget Marsh, where hundreds of examples may 

 be seen in varying stages of growth. Some fine specimens are also 

 to be found in the Devonshire Marsh, probably taller than any others 

 in the islands. 



Junous bufonius L. 



S. B., No. 675, May, 1909. Cultivated ground, Harrington House. 

 S. 13., No. 725, June, 1909. Pembroke Marsh.

No. 415, 1905. Mr. Nicholas Periston, Paynter's Vale. S. B.. 

 No. 696, May, 1909. Abundant in a cultivated field near Devil's Hole. 

 Sisyrinchium bermudianum L. 



B. and B., No. 2 (fruit). Mt. Langdon, north shore. S. B., No. 

 661, May, 1909. Harrington House. "The Bermudiana," by which 

 name it is known throughout the islands where it is everywhere abun- 

 dant, growing in all kinds of situations. During April and May it is 

 a striking flower of the hills, roadsides and lawns. 

 Peperomia septentrionalis n. sp. 



Plant smooth, green throughout, except the peduncles and stems 

 which are frequently rosy when exposed to strong light. Stems 

 rather stout, 2 to 4 dm. long, ascending at the tips; leaves alternate, 

 blades leathery, entire, dark green and shining above, glandular 

 punctate, oval to ovate or obovate, slightly emarginate, 4 to 6 cm. long, 

 9 to 11 nerved, decurrent at the base, with the petioles 1 to 3 cm. long; 

 spikes terminal or axillary in the upper leaves, simple or several times 

 branched, .5 to 1.5 dm. long with peduncles shorter than the leaves, 

 rather densely flowered; nutlets oblong, slightly papillose, 1 mm. long 

 with a straight or slightly curved beak one-third their length. 



In woods usually on moist or shaded rocks, frequent throughout 

 the island from the Causeway to Tuckers Town, among the rocks and 

 around the caves, sinks and fissures; also in the shaded portion of 

 Paget Marsh, growing on the damp ground and over the stones, 

 flowering from late autumn to spring. Probably most nearly related 

 to P. magnolicefolia microsphyxia Dahlstedt, from which it differs in 

 the relatively broader leaves and the less strongly papillose nutlets 

 which are oblong instead of ovate-globose.

MOLLUSCA OF THE SOUTHWESTERN STATES, III: THE HUACHUCA 



MOUNTAINS, ARIZONA. 



BY HENRY A. PILSBRY and JAMES H. FERRISS. 



The Huachuca Mountains stand in the southwest angle of Cochise 

 county, Arizona, their southern foothills reaching over the international 

 boundary. The highest summits do not quite attain 10,000 feet. 

 Northward the Whetstone range looms up, a fine if arid mountain 

 mass, as yet unexplored for shells. On every side lies the desert, 

 barren of molluscan life. Our purpose is to give an account, incom- 

 plete as it now may be, of the molluscan life of this range. 1 



The Huachucas have not yet been accurately mapped. The sketch

1 A few new records are added of species taken in river drift at Benson, Cochise 

 county, some distance northward from the Huachuca range. These forms 

 were derived from some other district. Other records from Benson may be 

 found in our Mollusca of the Southwestern States, II, 1906, and in Dall, Proc, U S 

 Nat. Mus., XIX, 1896.

here given shows the general positions of localities mentioned in the 

 text. 



The first mollusks collected in the Huachucas were taken by a 

 Mr. Cox, who sent some Helices to Dr. Isaac Lea many years ago, 

 with the locality "Tucson." These shells are what we now call Ashmun- 

 ella varicifera. Nothing is known of Cox beyond his name on the 

 label. At the time these shells were collected Tucson was no doubt 

 the nearest settlement or post to the Huachucas, and hence was put 

 down as the locality. It is not unlikely that Cox picked up these 

 shells in the course of a chase from the army post at Tucson after 

 marauding Apaches. Be this as it may, Ashmunella varicifera is an 

 indubitable Huachucan snail, and was collected at a time when hostile 

 and dangerous Indians occupied that country. On the death of 

 Dr. Lea the specimens came into the possession of the National Museum, 

 where they are now preserved. 



In 1880 Mr. Bland described a snail, Triodopsis levettei (now Ash- 

 munella levettei), collected by Dr. G. M. Levette, and thought to be 

 from near Santa Fe, New Mexico. Explorations in that region have 

 shown that the Ashmunellas there are of a somewhat different type, 

 and the true habitat of the species was not known until Mr. Ferriss 

 rediscovered the species in the Huachucas, where it is restricted to the 

 heads of certain canyons. It is certain, therefore, that Dr. Levette 

 had forgotten where he procured the original specimens, which are 

 now in the American Museum of Natural History, New York. 



The first snails actually reported from the Huachucas were collected 

 by Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U. S. A., a member of the party surveying the 

 Mexican boundary in 1892-1894. They were described by Dr. W. H. Dall 

 in two papers, 2 published in 1895 and 1896. Six species were obtained 

 in the Huachuca range : 3 



Polygyra levettei [ = Ashmunella I. angigyra]. 

 Polygyra mearnsi [ = Ashmunella mearnsi]. 



Epiphragmophora hachitana, depressed variety from Tanner Canyon 

 [ = Sonorella dalli]. 



Patula strigosa var. [ = Oreohelix s. huachucana].

 by the International Boundary Commission of the United States and Mexico, 

 1892-1894, same Proc, XIX, pp. 333-379. 



3 Dr. Dall's pioneer work on southern Arizona shells was published prior to the 

 anatomical researches which led to the establishment of new genera for the 

 Helices of that region. He had only dry shells to deal with, and hence followed 

 the generic nomenclature current at that time. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 497 



Patula s. concentrata [ = Oreohelix s. concentrata], 

 Cionella lubrica [ = Cochlicopa lubrica]. 



Several Huachucan species were figured by Mr. Paul Bartsch in 

 his monograph of Sonorella, 1904, and S. dalli n. sp. was described. 



The seven species of snails mentioned above sum up all that was 

 known of Huachucan mollusks prior to the visit of Mr. Ferriss in 1902. 

 In 1904 the range was again visited, 4 and again in 1907 Messrs. Ferriss 

 and L. E. Daniels made extensive collections. Dr. Henry Skinner, the 

 well-known entomologist, made a useful collection of shells in Carr 

 Canyon, in August, 1905, and Mr. C. R. Biederman has contributed a 

 few species from the same place. 



The present report is based upon practically all of the material 

 ever collected in the Huachucas. Through the unfailing kindness of 

 Dr. Dall, the series in the National Museum has been examined. 

 Dr. Gratacap has permitted a re-examination of the types of Ashmun- 

 ella levettei; and Dr. Bartsch has assisted with various helpful services. 



HELICIDiE. 

 Genus SONORELLA Pils. 



The Huachucan Sonorellas are all distinct specifically from those 

 of other ranges. So far as known anatomically, they belong to groups 

 special to this range ; hence speak for a long isolation. 



Omitting S. huachucana, which is unknown anatomically, the species 

 of the Huachuca and Patagonia Mountains can be determined by 

 this key: 



a. — Penis long (about 40 mm. in a shell 27 mm. diam.), with a short 

 hollow papilla containing a tube; epiphallus long, 49-60 mm.; 



flagellum present, S. dalli. 



a 1 . — Penis and epiphallus short, the former containing a fleshy, cylin- 

 dric papilla over half the length of penis; flagellum vestigeal 

 or wanting. 

 b. — Vagina about as long as penis; spermatheca and duct about 



four times as long, S. rowelli. 



b l . — Vagina much longer than the penis; spermatheca and duct 

 not differing greatly from vagina in length. 

 c. — Penis 5 to 7.5, papilla 3.3 to 5 mm. long; upper part of 

 vagina muscular, swollen, usually fusiform, 



S. gramdatissima. 



c l . — Penis 12 to 19, papilla 9 to 13 mm. long; vagina slender, 



with a small fleshy node midway, . . S. danielsi.

S. virilis hiiachucana Pilsbry, Proc. A. N. S. Phila., 1905, p. 267, pi. 17, 

 fig. 24. 



This is a non-granulose species with conspicuous pale borders along 

 the brown band. We formerly thought it a subspecies of A. virilis 

 of the Chiricahua range, but since all the other Helices of this range 

 are specifically distinct, it is not likely that huachucana will prove an 

 exception. It comes from Brown's and Bear Canyons, and must be 

 rare or very local. None were taken in 1907. 



The soft anatomy is unknown. We therefore know nothing of its 

 relationships with other species. Fig. 16 represents a shell from 

 Bear Canyon. Fig. 17 the type from Brown's Canyon. 



Group of S. dalli.

 Epiphragmophora hachitana, depressed variety from Tanner Canyon, Dall, 



Proc. U. S. N. M., XIX, pp. 339, 340, pi. 31, figs. 7, 10 (1896). 



Specimens were taken only in Tanner Canyon, the type locality. 

 It is probably restricted to this place. It is a fine species, distin- 

 guished by the broad, flattened shape, very open umbilicus and much 

 deflexed last whorl. The largest specimen taken measures 28 mm., 

 the smallest 23 mm. diameter. Compared with &. granulatissima latior, 

 which also occurs in Tanner Canyon, *S. dalli is more openly umbilicate, 

 the aperture is flattened above, the oblique sculpture is coarser. In 

 some old specimens the front edge of the parietal callus is thickened, a 

 narrow ridge connecting the ends of the lip. 



The penis (pi. XXII, fig. 4) is extremely long, slightly enlarged 

 distally, its walls thin, with most minute and close transverse ruga?. 

 It contains a smooth papilla, tapering to an obtuse apex, and about 

 one-fifth the length of the penis. The papilla is hollow with rather 

 thin walls. Within it a slender tube runs from the epiphallus to the 

 apex, where it opens by a lateral pore. This tube is lightly attached 

 to the wall of the penis-papilla. It is indicated by dotted lines in 

 fig. 4. The epiphallus is extremely long, terminating in a short 

 flagellum. The penis retractor muscle, 7 mm. long, is inserted upon 

 it 4 mm. from the end of the penis. The long vagina has a slender 

 neck, enlarging moderately above. 



The spermatheca is globular, on a duct much shorter than the penis. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 499 



In one specimen dissected it bears a minute diverticulum about 1 mm. 

 long, 2 mm. from the base of the duct. In another individual no 

 diverticulum was found, so that it may possibly be abnormal or 

 pathologic. The measurements of the organs in two individuals 

 preserved in formalin follow:

" epiphallus, ....... 49 " 60 



" flagellum, 4 " 3 



" " vagina, 25 



" " spermatheca and duct, .... 34 " 27 



The jaw (pi. XXII, fig. 6) has five strong ribs grouped in the middle 

 half of its length. 



The radula has about 41, 1, 41 teeth (pi. XXII, fig. 8). The central 

 and lateral teeth have mesocones only; on the 17th an ectocone appears. 

 On the outer marginal teeth the inner cusp or sometimes both cusps are 

 bifid, but the ectocone is not split into several cusps as in some other 

 species. 



The excessive length of penis and epiphallus, and especially the 

 hollow, thin-walled papilla containing a separate duct or tube (a 

 structure unique in the genus), are characters which set S. dalli apart 

 from all other known Sonorellas. It stands alone in its own line of 

 differentiation. 



Group of S. granulatissima. 



These forms are closely related to the group of S. hachitana, but 

 differ by the thick, quite cylindric penis-papilla, solid except for the 

 minute perforation, and very obtuse or truncate at its distal end, 

 and by having no flagellum or only a minute vestigeal one. In the 

 hachitana group the papilla tapers, at least at the distal end, and a 

 minute but distinctly developed flagellum is present in known forms. 

 The distinction is only a small matter, but serves to distinguish the 

 Huachucan forms. S. rowelli (Newc), from a little farther west, 

 belongs to the same group. 



The dimensions of the genitalia in several specimens of each form 

 are given in the accompanying table. Most of the specimens were 

 preserved in alcohol in the field, and some variation is doubtless 

 traceable to various degrees of contraction.

Proc. A. N. S. Phila., 1905, p. 262, pi. 17, figs. 21-23; pi. IS, figs. 41-43, 

 51-54. 



The typical form is found in Ramsey (figs. 7, 8), Carr and Miller 

 (fig. 9) Canyons. Types were from Ramsey. The shell is distin- 

 guished by its very dense beautiful granulation and the faintness or 

 absence of spiral lines, though on some specimens they are present, 

 but very weak. 



I have examined the genitalia in a number of individuals from each 

 of the three canyons mentioned above. Figs. 1, 2, 3 represents one 

 of the two cotypes. Fig. 4 is from an example from Miller Canyon. 

 The chief feature is that the upper part of the vagina has thick muscular 

 walls, the outer layer consisting of glossy circular muscular fibers. 

 Usually this part is more or less swollen and fusiform. The lower part 

 of the vagina is thin-walled. This feature was conspicuous in every 

 one of about 20 individuals of 12 lots of S. granulatissima and S. g. 

 latior which were examined. The penis is short, its length contained 

 3 or 4 times in that of the vagina. It is abruptly truncate distally. 

 The penis-papilla is quite short, 3.3 to 5 mm. long, cylindric, truncate 

 at the end, and coarsely wrinkled. It is fleshy, perforated by a minute 

 pore, which opens at the end. The rather short epiphallus has no 

 flagellum in any example opened with the exception of one of the 

 cotypes, in which there is a minute, vestigeal flagellum about 0.7 mm.

long, and bound to the vas deferens by the outer muscular fascia. 

 As a rule, with rare exceptions, therefore, the flagellum is absent.

Usually a larger shell than S. granulatissima, the last whorl more 

 depressed, approaching S. dalli in shape. Originally described from 

 Brown's Canyon, it is now known also from the south side of Limestone 

 Mountain, east fork Salvation Ridge 6 and from Tanner Canyon. Three 

 cotypes are figured. 



The genitalia have been examined in numerous examples from 

 Tanner Canyon (pi. XXI, fig. 6), Brown's Canyon, east fork of 

 Salvation Ridge and Limestone Mountain. The characters are iden- 

 tical with those of S. granulatissima. All of them have the upper 

 part of the vagina swollen, and there is no flagellum. Measurements 

 of several alcoholic specimens are given in the table. 



Fig. 2. Marginal teeth of >S. g. latior, Tanner Canyon. 



The radula has 38, 1, 38 teeth, with 10 laterals. The outer marginal 

 teeth have the inner cusp deeply bifid, the outer one sometimes split 

 (fig. 2, No. 94,383, Tanner Canyon). 



Sonorella granulatissima parya Pils. PI. XIX, figs. 10, 11, 12. 



No further information on this small race from the northwestern 

 end of the range has been received. S. mearnsi Bartsch, from 4 miles 

 south of the international boundary, a few miles east of the San Pedro 

 river, is another form which will probably prove to be closely allied 

 to granulatissima and rowelli when the anatomy can be examined.

The animal is slaty-blackish, the back paler, brownish-gray, collar

 gray, but the areas are not bounded by lines. The lung has faint 

 venation ; pulmonary vein breaking up into several large branches. 



Fig. 3. Jaw and teeth of a cotype of Sonorella danielsi. 



Genitalia.— -The penis is very large, stout, subcylindric, half the 

 length of the vagina or longer. It collapses at the base, where not 

 filled by the papilla, and has several strong longitudinal folds inside. 

 It contains a long cylindric papilla which is abruptly truncate at the 

 end and wrinkled throughout. There is no flagellum. The long 

 vagina is rather slender throughout, with an annular swelling or node 

 about midway of its length. It is longitudinally rugose within, the 

 rugae coalescent at the node. Other organs as usual. Fig. 7 was 

 drawn from a drowned specimen which had not been in alcohol (No. 

 94,318). 



The jaw has six or seven very low, wide ribs, parted by narrow 

 intervals. The radula has about 47, 1, 47 teeth. In most rows the 

 fifteenth tooth has an ectocone. No marginal teeth with the ectocone 

 bifid were seen. The nineteenth tooth, in the radula figured, is abnor- 

 mal. One of the outer marginals is shown above it. 



Types No. 94,318 A. N. S. P., from head of Bear Canyon; also 

 Miller Peak and east fork of Cave Creek. 



Similar forms, but with the ground-color not yellow but pale brown 

 (as in granulatissima), occur in Ida Canyon, Cave Creek and Ash 

 Canyon (pi. XIX, fig. 18). 



This species replaces granulatissima on the south side and east end 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 503 



of the Huachuca range. It differs from S. granulatissima chiefly 

 in the genitalia, the larger penis and the shape of the vagina being 

 constant features in the series of both species dissected. Specimens 

 have been dissected from five lots, from the head of Bear Canyon 

 (fig. 7), east fork of Cave, and from Miller Peak (fig. 5). One individ- 

 ual of several from the latter place seems to have the very minute 

 bud-like vestige of a nagellum. 



The shell will be recognized by its yellow, glossy surface and depressed 

 shape. The brownish forms from Ida and Ash Canyons, mentioned 

 above, require more study, with better fresh or alcoholic material than 

 we can command at this time. One from Ash Canyon is figured, fig. 18. 



Named in honor of Mr. L. E. Daniels, who accompanied Mr. Ferriss 

 in the expedition of 1907. 



Genus ASHMUNELLA Pils. and Ckll. 



The Ashmunellas of the Huachuca range, while very diverse in 

 appearance, belong to a single closely related group. Probably all 

 descended from an ancestral stock not unlike A. levettei angigyra, the 

 most widely distributed form, and the one showing most affinity to 

 species of the Chiricahua and other ranges. The common ancestry 

 of the whole series is demonstrated by the intermediate stages found 

 among the shells, and by the soft anatomy, which is so much alike in 

 all that it would probably be impossible to tell the species apart 

 without the shells, yet differing characteristically from the soft parts 

 of all Ashmunellas of the Chiricahuas or other ranges by the sacculated 

 or varicose spermatheca and the shape of the penis. 



The species and races form a beautiful chain of variations, pretty 

 completely connecting those having most complicated apertures with 

 those in which the aperture is toothless, thus: bifurca — levettei — 

 ursina — heterodonta — varicifera. 



Evolution has proceeded from fully toothed apertures towards 

 toothless apertures. In other words it has been retrogressive, marked 

 by degeneration of complex structures. 



Soft Anatomy of Ashmunella. — Time has not admitted a full exami- 

 nation of the anatomy, but the genitalia of many individuals have been 

 studied. These organs are so similar in all of the forms that one 

 description will suffice. The penis (P.) is rather large for an Ash- 

 munella. Inside it has six unequal fleshy longitudinal ridges, inter- 

 rupted in the middle (pi. XX, fig. 6). This point is marked exter- 

 nally by a slight constriction. The epi phallus (epi.) is very long, 

 terminating in a minute flagellum (/?.). The retractor muscle (rp.) 




504 



PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[Nov., 



is attached to the epiphallus, but sends down a band to the apex 

 of the penis. The vas deferens (vd.) is very long and free. The 

 vagina is short. Spermatheca (sp.) is not distinctly divided into 

 head and duct. The distal two-thirds or more is of about equal 

 caliber, and distinctly varicose or sacculated. The proximal portion 

 is a little contracted. This form of spermatheca is special to the 

 Huachucan species, and unlike those of other districts. The other 

 organs show no peculiar features. The dimensions of the organs in 

 millimeters are as follows :

The shell is depressed, the spire low, varying from convex to low- 

 conoidal, the periphery of the last whorl situated above the middle, 

 obtusely subangular in front. Color rather light-brown and opaque; 

 or corneous-brown and somewhat transparent (sometimes pure white). 

 Surface rather glossy, lightly marked with growth-lines and faint 

 traces of incised spiral lines. Umbilicus rather narrow but open. 

 Aperture oblique, at about 45° with the axis. Peristome rather narrow,

 the inner rim of the outer lip, and sometimes the very slight indication 

 of an outer basal tooth. 



At resting stages young shells form a callous thickening within the 

 lip, which shows through as a radial streak in some adult shells.

 the south side of the mouth of Ash Canyon. These localities, except 

 the last, are indicated by three areas of vertical shading on the map. 

 Miller Peak is about 9,800 feet high. 



This species has not been fully described before. The "varices" to 

 which the name is due are only occasionally present in adult shells. 

 They are also seen in A. chiricahuana, which is so similar that until 

 now the Chiricahuan and Huachucan snails were supposed to belong 

 to one species. The soft anatomy shows at once that we have to do 

 with two species. A. varicifera has genitalia exactly like A. levettei 

 except that the epiphallus is somewhat shorter. The spermatheca is 

 not differentiated from its duct, the whole form a long somewhat

varicose cylindric body, while in chiricahuana the duct is extremely 

 long, swollen at the end. The proportions vary widely in the two 

 species, as follows : 



A. varicifera. A. chiricahuana 

 Length of penis, epiphallus and flagellum, 37 to 44 mm. 73 mm. 

 Length of spermatheca and duct, . . . 25 to 27 " 56 " 



Length of vagina, 4 to 5 " 9 '" 



The size of the shells is about equal. It appears from this that 

 A. varicifera is a simplified member of the A. levettei stock, while 

 A. chiricahuana belongs to another group of species. 



The type locality of A. chiricahuana is Fly Park, Chiricahua Moun- 

 tains. 



Extract from Mr. Ferriss' Field Notes. — On the Cave Creek side we 

 found A. varicifera larger than the lot from Wickersham's Rock on 

 the peak, and generally albino. Out of one hole containing 29, only 

 two were dark colored. On the other side of the east fork of Cave Creek 

 they were larger but all dark. On the south side of the range there is 

 a strong tendency to albinism in the Ashmunellas, Sonorellas and 

 Oreohelix. 



Ashmunella miorodonta a. sp. Fig. 5. 



The shell resembles A. varicifera in general appearance, but differs 

 by having fewer whorls, the last wider viewed from above; umbilicus 

 much wider, exposing more of the penultimate whorl. The lip is 

 toothless except for a very low vestige in tne basal margin in some 

 specimens; but there is a minute tubercular parietal tooth in over

 in all. The shell is chestnut colored, usually with one or two varix- 

 streaks on the base; lip white or with its upper half reddish-brown.

This is another modification of the levettei stock, differing from 

 heterodonta and varicifera by its wider umbilicus and less closely coiled 

 whorls, from the former by deficient lip teeth, and from the latter by 

 the usual presence of a minute parietal tooth. In genitalia it does not 

 differ from typical levettei. While not conspicuously differentiated, 

 we have thought it well to give the form specific rank.

Nautilus, XVIII, 



This form has the shape of A. levettei, and typically has a low, 

 straight-topped tooth within the outer lip, a small tubercular tooth 

 at junction of outer and basal margins, and a faint prominence in the 

 position of an inner basal tooth. The parietal tooth is minute or 

 wanting. There are barely over 6 whorls, which therefore are a little 

 wider than in A. levettei. 



We have elsewhere noted the extreme variability of the teeth in 

 heterodonta. They may be much more developed than described above, 

 or so degenerate that only faint traces of teeth are discernible. A 

 form-chain connecting levettei and varicifera exists. Whether hybrid- 

 ism plays a part here remains uncertain. 



Fig. 6. Ashmunella levettei heterodonta. Cotype. 



This form occurs in the heads of Ida and Cave Canyons. In one 

 place heterodonta goes over the divide two or three hundred feet, but in 

 no other case do these species cross to the other side of the range. 

 A. levettei or heterodonta are not found in varicifera territory. There is 

 no mingling of Ashmunellas except large and small forms of levettei. 

 The peculiarities of habit, variation, etc., of the Ashmunellas, Oreo- 

 helices, etc., is worthy of a year's study in the Huachucas. The area

of heterodonta is marked H on the map. Cave Creek Canyon, like that 

 of the same name in the Chiricahna range, has a large basin and many 

 branches.

The shell is like A. levettei, capacious and glossy. The aperture is 

 less obstructed by the teeth. The parietal tooth is smaller, straight, 

 not curving inward at the axial end, or almost imperceptibly so, and 

 without an outer branch running towards the upper insertion of the lip.

The type specimen of this species (fig. 8) was supposed to come from 

 Santa Fe Canyon, New Mexico, but it is distinctly of Huachucan type. 

 The periphery is rounded. The glossy surface is marked with fine 

 growth-wrinkles, and on the last whorl very fine and very faint spiral 

 line-;. The parietal callus is distinct, but thin at the edge. The 

 parietal tooth is long, high, straight, but at the axial end it becomes 

 low and curves strongly inward. From the distal end of the tooth a

This branch is brownish, like the callus 



it rests upon, hence might easily be 



overlooked. The outer lip-tooth is 



slightly emarginate at the top, and 



curves inward. The outer basal tooth 



is compressed and larger than the inner 



one, which is also somewhat compressed.

 the opportunity of studying this speci- 

 men to the kindness of Dr. L. P. Gratacap. 



Some specimens from Miller Canyon 

 are identical in characters with the type 

 of levettei. It probably was collected in 

 that canyon. 



In Carr Canyon there is a similar 

 race having some differential characters. 

 Dr. Henry Skinner collected a series of 

 several hundred shells. They were 

 taken about midway of the canyon as 

 shown in the map. These shells vary 

 in size: 



Alt. 6, diam. 13 mm.; whorls 6\. 

 " 7 " 13 " " 6$. 



" 7.5 " 15 " diam. aperture 7 mm. ; whorls 6^. 



The last whorl is rather depressed and periphery is slightly angular 

 in front, these being the main differences from typical A. levettei. In 

 some specimens the shape of the aperture and of the parietal tooth is 

 exactly as in levettei, but most examples have the aperture smaller, 

 the lip-ends approaching somewhat more, and connected by the thick- 

 ened edge of the parietal callus. The parietal tooth almost always 

 is recurved at the axial end, and bears a more or less distinct recurrent 

 branch from the distal end, as in levettei. In some examples, however, 

 the parietal tooth is straight and there is no perceptible outer branch; 

 the upper margin of the lip descends more deeply on the parietal wall 

 than in the type of levettei. The young snails form a very thick lip- 

 callus at resting stages.

This Can- Canyon race is intermediate between typical levettei and

Ashmunella levettei bifurca n. subsp. 



In Tanner Canyon the shells resemble those of Carr Canyon. They 

 are glossy, dark chestnut colored, depressed, the last whorl angular 

 in front. The aperture is small, the lip-ends connected by a distinct, 

 often heavy parietal cord. The outer lip-tooth is pushed farther back 

 into the mouth. The parietal tooth curves inward at its axial end, and 

 usually gives off a distinct branch from the distal end, though this 

 may be weak or wanting in some examples. The umbilicus is usually 

 wider than in other forms of levettei. The whorls coil closelv.

Alt. 6.6. diam. 15, diam. of aperture 6.9 mm., whorls fully 6i. 



This race is intensified in the development of apertural teeth. 

 A. mearnsi (Dall) is more depressed and has less numerous, less closely 

 coiled whorls. 



The spermatheca is more slender, scarcely sacculate or less con- 

 spicuously so than in other Huachucan species, and is a little enlarged 

 towards the end, the lower part of the duct slender. 



Ashmunella levettei angigyra Pils.

Smaller, more depressed than levettei, and more or less angular at 

 the periphery, teeth contracting the aperture more. 



The types, described and illustrated as above cited, were from 

 Ramsey Canyon (called "Conservatory Canyon" in the original 

 paper). Those from northwestward and along the warm dry slopes 

 of the ridge are more typical of the race, being smaller and more 

 angular. The parietal tooth is straight and rather small, without an 

 outer branch. It occurs along the northeastern side of the range from 

 northwest to southeast as follows : Babokomari Creek; FortHuachuca; 

 Tanner Canyon, over the range, west fork, and along cliffs south of

the canyon; Brown's Canyon; Limestone Mountain, 9,000 feet; 

 Ramsey Canyon ; also over the range on the f oothills of Bear Canyon at 

 about 5,000 feet, where it is very widely separated from other known 

 localities, and very small, diam. 9.5 to 11 mm. 



The race from Carr Canyon is intermediate between angigyra and 

 levettei in size and shape of the last whorl. The examples from Lime-

stone Mountain and Salvation Ridge approach those of Carr Canyon 

 in size and apertural teeth, and would probably be grouped with that 

 race rather than with typical angigyra, if the two be separable. 



A. I. angigyra is the common and widely distributed Ashmunella 

 of the Huachucas. The other forms are very local. 



The epi phallus is curiously flattened, dumbbell-shaped in section 

 in several individuals (alcoholic) from east fork of Salvation Canyon, 

 and the lower part of the spermatheca duct is slender.

This species was described as from two widely separated localities. 

 It differs from all other Huachucan species by having fewer, less closely 

 coiled whorls. In these features it belongs to a small group of forms 

 from southwestern New Mexico, composed of A. walker i Ferriss and 

 A. kochi Clapp. We have much to learn about the snails of these 

 alluring desert mountains, but it seems likely that there was a mistake 

 in the locality Huachuca Mountains, and that the species really came 

 from the Hacheta Grande Mountains only.

 Agriolimax hemphilli ashmuni Pilsbry and Vanatta. 

 Nautilus, XXII, p. 108. 



Limaces are rare in Arizona, but Mr. Ashmun took specimens at 

 Nogales, Pima county, 4,000 ft. elevation, and they were found by one 

 of us in Miller, Brown and Tanner Canyons in the Huachucas. 



These slugs belong to the very widely distributed group of Agrio- 

 limax Icevis, but we have not been able to refer them directly to any 

 described race. By the development of entocones on the lateral teeth 

 they differ from A. campestris (including montanus Ing.), and agree 

 with A. hemphilli (Binney), 7 A. stenurus (Strebel) 8 and A. berendti 

 (Strebel). 9 Whether these forms are specifically distinct or not 

 remains to be determined. Their distinctive characters do not seem 

 important. 



The alcoholic specimens from Miller Canyon have the general aspect 

 externally of A. campestris. The rounded back is black, flanks sooty 

 brown. The mantle is large, and more than half of it is free, so that 

 when lifted and turned back it more than covers the posterior adnate 

 portion. Under it the surface is yellowish. The sole is very narrow, 

 conspicuously tripartite. The central tooth is tricuspid. Laterals 

 have a small entocone elevated on the side of the mesocone; ectocone

well developed. There are 13 lateral teeth, the 13th being transitional 

 to the marginals, which are simple, thorn-shaped. Jaw as usual. 

 The penis is large, much twisted, terminates in an obtuse "flagellum" 

 or blind sack, and it has a fleshy sensory papilla in the anterior enlarge- 

 ment, shown by dotted lines in fig. 8 c. In front of this enlargement 

 it is very slender. It has an extremely slender retractor muscle 

 (p.r.). Other organs as usual in the group. 



Examples from Tanner Canyon have the same genitalia, but differ

 specimen from Nogales. c, genitalia of the type from Miller Canyon. 



in external color. They are pale soiled buff, with a slightly darker 

 reticulation back of the mantle, which is closely flecked with gray. 

 These slugs are therefore not unlike A. hemphilli pictus Ckll. 



According to Mr. Binney, A. hemphilli has 50, 1, 50 teeth with 10 

 laterals. This is somewhat unlike our slug, which has more lateral 

 teeth, though of the same shape; moreover, the penis of A. hemphilli 

 seems to differ from the Arizona form, which occurs in a region other- 

 wise wholly diverse in its mollusk population. A. stenurus and 

 A. berendti of Strebel belong to the tropical fauna. Since the Arizona 

 form differs materially in dentition from the described alpine slugs of 

 Colorado, we have thought it safest to give a special name to the 

 mountain slug of Arizona, until such time as the several forms can be 

 actually compared by some observer, and their relations to one 

 another elucidated. 



The types of A. hemphilli ashmuni are No. 94,366 A. N. S. P., from

A NEW SONORELLA FROM THE RINCON MOUNTAINS ARIZONA. 

 BY H. A. PILSBRY and J. H. FERRISS. 



The Rincon Mountains lie near the western border of Cochise County, 

 Arizona, north of the Whetstone Mountains, which are north of the 

 Huachuca range. 



In 1907 one of us (Mr. Ferriss) visited the range and procured 

 specimens of a large Sonorella, the first mollusk known from these 

 mountains.

Where visited the range is rather dry. The rock is granitic, of 

 pre-Cambrian age. l Besides Sonorella rinconensis onty a few shells 

 were taken, minute forms common to the region. Sonorella rincon- 

 ensis was found sticking to large rocks and boulders, a habit not 

 hitherto noticed in the genus. They are rare, the biggest bag made 

 being six in one day.

The shell resembles S. ashmuni Bartsch in shape. It is pale brown 

 fading to white around the umbilicus, with a broad chocolate shoulder- 

 band, widely whitish-bordered above and below. The surface is 

 smoothish, marked with delicate growth-lines, and under the lens some 

 faint spiral lines may be traced on the last whorl near the suture. The 

 embryonic whorls have sculpture of the S. hachitana type. The 

 whorls increase rather slowly to the last, which is much widened, and 

 well rounded peripherally. It descends a little in front. The aper- 

 ture is rotund-lunate; peristome slightly expanded, dilated at the 

 columella as usual. Umbilicus about as in S. ashmuni.

 also taken on Mt. Mica and Wrong Mountain, Rincon range. 



The jaw (pi. XXII, fig. 7) has six or seven strong ribs, projecting 

 on both margins. 



The radula has 26, 15, 1, 15, 26 teeth (pi. XXII, figs. 1, 2, 3). The 

 central and lateral teeth are unicuspid, the cusps stout and obtuse, 

 longer than the basal plates. At about the sixteenth tooth an ectocone 

 appears. Towards the outer edge of the radula the inner cusp becomes 

 bifid; and in many but not all of the outermost six or eight marginals 

 the ectocone is split into two or three denticles (fig. 3). 



Conchologically this form stands very close to S. ashmuni Bartsch, 

 from Richinbar, south of Prescott, Arizona; also found at Jerome, and 

 at Purtyman's ranch on Oak Creek, 40 miles from Jerome. It would 

 probably be scarcely possible to separate the two species by the shells 

 alone. The genitalia, however, are widely diverse. S. ashmuni 

 (Oak Creek) has genitalia of the type found in hachitcwia-like Sonorel- 

 las of the Peloncillo, Florida and Dos Cabezas ranges, while S. rinconen- 

 sis has the penis and vagina excessively lengthened While quite 

 unlike any known form, it seems nearer to S. virilis than to other species 

 which have been dissected, but differs from that by its far shorter 

 penis-papilla and by the vagina, which is much longer than the penis, 

 while in S. virilis the penis is longer.

MELANIID.E OF THE PANUCO RIVER SYSTEM, MEXICO. 

 BY H. A. PILSBRY and A. A. HINKLEY. 



The Pachycheili of the Panuco River system are all, so far as known, 

 special to that drainage. * These waters are remarkably rich in fine 

 species, which though not so large as some from Central America, are 

 more varied in shape and sculpture. In a few species the spire is so 

 short that the shell has a globular or oval shape, like Anculosa or 

 Paludomus ; yet in the structure of the aperture and operculum these 

 aberrant forms agree with more normal species of the same region. 

 One species, P. pleurotoma, has a Pleurotomoid sinus in the outer lip, 

 somewhat like that of P. dalli Pils., but situated farther up. 



The whole group of the Panuco drainage differs from the southern 

 forms of Pachycheilus in the weakness or absence of the regular and 

 close microscopic spiral striation characteristic of the typical species. 



The shells are generally abundant. Of most of the forms several 

 hundred shells at least of each species have been examined. All were 

 collected by Mr. Hinkley during the past winter. The descriptions 

 are the joint work of both authors. The figures are natural size. 

 Cotypes of the new forms are in the collections of the Academy of 

 Natural Sciences of Philadelphia and of Mr. Hinkley. 



Since many of the localities mentioned herein are not indicated 

 on maps available in this country, we give here a sketch of the lower 

 portion of the Panuco River System. 2 



1 It is possible that P. pluristriatus is an exception, but the record of that 

 species from a West Mexican lake seems improbable.

Paohycheilus pila n. sp. PI. XXIV, figs. 1-5. 



The shell is solid and strong, irregularly globose, black, smooth 

 but for inconspicuous growth-lines (except the very young shells 

 which are delicately, closely striate spirally); spire very short, mainly 

 eroded in adult shells, but concavely acuminate when preserved in the 

 young. Only 2 or 3 whorls remain in adult shells, the last very globose 

 throughout, more or less flattened below the suture near the aperture. 

 The aperture is large, black within; outer Up thin, much more arcuate 

 than the inner lip, which is only slightly arcuate. Columellar margin 

 heavily calloused throughout, black, with a white lining on the inner 

 border.

Tamosopo River above and below the "Natural Bridge,'" near 

 Verastagu, State of San Luis Potosi, Mexico. 



The water in the basin above the bridge is in constant agitation, 

 caused by the falls of several small streams feeding it and the narrow 

 outlet, so there are several inches of the rock walls alternately covered 

 and exposed. The positions occupied by the different species of 

 Pachycheilus were quite diverse, the P. pila always being submerged, 

 while P. atratus and humerosus were higher up and often entirely 

 beyond the reach of the water. Below the bridge P. pila was on 

 submerged rocks, while the other species were most plentiful at or near 

 the surface. 



This is the shortest, most globose species of Pachycheilus known, 

 having the contour of an Anculosa or Paludomus. The youngest stage 

 examined is about 2 mm. long, at which time the shape is ovate-conic. 

 At 5^ mm. long, with the spire of 5 whorls still perfect, the last whorl 

 has become inflated, and traces of very fine delicate spiral strise 

 remain. The types (pi. XXIV, figs. 1 to 5) are from below the "Nat- 

 ural Bridge." Some examples apparently adult are smaller than the 

 dimensions given above, alt. 13^, diam. 13 mm. 



Specimens from a tributary of the Tamosopo River at the Tamosopo 

 Sugar Company's plantation are all smaller. Specimens measure:

mm. long. This small race might be distinguished as P. pila pilula 

 n. var. (pi. XXIV, fig. 6). 



Pachycheilus tristis n. sp. PI. XXIV, figs. 7-10. 



The shell is short, ovate, brown, the last whorl smooth when adult. 

 Spire conic but deeply eroded in adults, rarely showing more than 

 3 whorls distinctly. The last whorl is convex. Aperture bluish-white 

 inside. Outer margin thin, strongly arched, forming half a circle; 

 inner margin slightly arcuate, heavily calloused, white throughout 

 or with a brown edge. 



The neanic stage, length 10-11 mm., is conic with an elevated spire 

 sculptured with spiral carinse, 3 on each whorl of the spire, one ridge 

 being just below the suture, another below the middle, and the third 

 just above the succeeding suture. On the last whorl there are 4 or 5 

 spiral ridges, the lowest one weak, below the periphery. Subsequently 

 the whorls become more inflated and the spiral sculpture weakens, 

 either disappearing in the penultimate whorl or a single subsutural 

 ridge and sulcus may persist until the beginning of the last whorl.

Tamasopo River at the "Natural Bridge," near Verastagu, State of 

 San Luis Potosi. Very few found above the bridge, but quite plentiful 

 below. 



Adult shells of this species resemble P. pila in shape, but they differ 

 by the brown color, bluish-white aperture and white columella. Old 

 shells which have lost most of the spire by erosion are hard to dis- 

 tinguish from P. pila. The characters of the young are wholly diverse, 

 and show P. tristis to be related to P. humerosus and P. atratus. Com- 

 pared with P. humerosus, P. tristis differs in lacking a shouldered last 

 whorl, the more ovate shape and the color. It differs from P. atratus 

 in shape, sculpture and color. 



Pachycheilus moctezumensis n. sp. PL XXIV, figs. 11, 12. 



The shell is globose-oval, solid, purplish-black. The spire is very 

 short, the apex slightly projecting; earlier whorls light brown, the apex 

 eroded. Whorls of the spire sculptured with several low spiral ridges. 

 Last whorl oval, smooth, aperture ovate, angular above, 'broadly 

 rounded below, dark within, black near the lip edge. Inner margin 

 calloused, white, usually with a brown edge.

Moctezuma River at the ford south of Tampamolon, State of San

With some resemblance to P. pila, this species differs by its more 

 oval shape, the last whorl being less convex and larger, the aperture 

 less wide. P. pila has quite a different facies from the great expansion 

 of the last whorl. 



In some examples the spire is longer than in those selected as typical : 

 length 23, diam. 15, aperture 14 mm., whorls 6, the spire being perfect.

This species is solid, straightly conic, light slate or drab to nearly 

 black in color, glossy, usually with a yellowish band below the suture 

 and sculptured with numerous acute spiral cords narrower and much 

 lighter colored than their intervals, usually 10 to 15 on the last, 6 on 

 the penultimate whorl. The embryonic whorls are smooth, following 

 ones have a keel above the suture, and soon a thread above the keel; 

 additional threads soon appearing. The suture is either rather incon- 

 spicuous throughout or moderately impressed at the later whorls. 

 The last whorl is convex. Aperture purple-brown inside, ovate, 

 acutely angular above. Outer lip thin, retracted above. Columella 

 rather narrow. Parietal callus is rather heavy, or sometimes very 

 thick, white, brown at the edge.

The exact locality of Say's type of this species is not known. It 

 was taken by Mr. Maclure, who went to Mexico by the Tampico route, 

 and therefore may have obtained the shells from the Coy River or its 

 neighborhood. The examples taken by Mr. Hinkley agree fully 

 with Say's. The locality of M. rubida Lea was also unknown. Prof.

von Martens figured a specimen from the Berlin Museum, taken by 

 Ferdinand Deppe between 1824 and 1837. These examples were 

 labelled as from Lake Chapala, at the western edge of the Mexican 

 plateau, and draining into the Pacific. It seems unlikely that this 

 snail has any such range, and we are disposed to believe that some 

 mistake about the locality of Deppe's shells has crept in. They agree 

 fully in shape and sculpture with the Coy River examples, but, like 

 M. rabida Lea, are dead shells, of a reddish color. 



Pachycheilus pluristriatus longus n. subsp. PI. XXIII, figs. 11, 12. 



The shell is longer than pluristriatus, black, sometimes fading to 

 flesh color towards the apex, not glossy. The keel above the suture 

 is more prominent and the other spirals are fewer and unequal, part 

 of them being very weak, and they are black like the ground color. 

 The suture is deeply impressed; the base of the last whorl is smooth 

 or weakly sculptured.

spiral cords below the suture and a weak angle at the shoulder. Last 

 whorl flattened below the very deep suture, elsewhere very convex 

 and smooth, though on some examples faint traces of very minute 

 spiral lines may be discerned. The aperture is rounded-oval or rounded- 

 ovate, somewhat livid and translucent within but generally with a 

 black band bordering the Up. It projects beyond the general outline 

 of the cone. Outer and basal margins of the peristome are thin, black, 

 and well rounded; inner margin straightened more or less, white 

 within, with a black or brown-black edge; 5 or 6 whorls remain in adult 

 shells, only the tips being eroded.

Tamosopo River near Verastagu, San Luis Potosi, above and below 

 the "Natural Bridge" (pi. XXIII, figs. 13 to 15). 



While clearly related to P. hamerosus, this species is easily distin- 

 guished by its rounded whorls. A large quantity of each was taken. 

 The type lot consists of beautifully perfect, clean shells from above 

 the bridge. Those found below the bridge are not so clean. 



Specimens from a rill issuing from a cave on the mountain side above 

 Los Canoas are incrusted with a gray calcareous deposit so that adults 

 resemble pebbles, but when cleaned the shell within is found to be 

 almost or entirely perfect (pi. XXIII, figs. 16, 17, 18). Fig. 18 repre- 

 sents a cleaned specimen. They are smaller than the type lot, about 

 24 mm. long. 



A lot taken in the rill on the mountain above the "Natural Bridge" 

 consists of dwarf shells, adults measuring 19 to 21 mm. long. P. pila 

 in the same stream is even more dwarfed. 



Pachycheilus atratus ganinus n. subsp. PI. XXIII, figs. 19, 20. 



A race of P. atratus occurs in the Ganina River three miles southwest 

 of San Dieguito. The black shell is dull with the middle and lower 

 whorls of the spire ridged or coarsely striate spirally, usually with 5 to 8 

 striae on the penultimate whorl. Several of these spiral cords usually 

 continue on the last whorl below the suture. The upper whorls of the 

 spire are smooth and convex. The aperture is shaped as in P. atratus. 

 Fig. 19 represents a cleaned shell, fig. 20 one incrusted. 



Length 24, diam. 13, aperture 1H mm. 



There are some abnormally shortened shells, length 17, diam. 12, 

 aperture 10^ mm. The spire is generally covered with a hard cal- 

 careous crust, difficult to remove. P. pluristriatus longus occurs in the 

 same place. 




526 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Nov., 



This form resembles P. a. suprastriatus closely, but differs by having 

 smooth post-embryonic whorls. It is also constantly black in color. 



Pachycheilus atratus suprastriatus n. subsp. 



The shell resembles P. atratus in shape and aperture. It is less 

 glossy, brownish black, dark brown or corneous-brown, the whorls 

 of the spire spirally striate, the striae sometimes persisting on the last 

 whorl below the suture. The earliest post-embryonic whorls are 

 acutely carinate, the carina continuing downward above the suture 

 as additional acute cords arise above it. On the third from the last 

 whorl, in a cotype, there are 5 equal acute striae!

Yalles River at I\Iecos falls, and some rapids two miles west of 

 Mecos, State of San Luis Potosi, Mexico. 



The only species of Pachycheilus found in the vicinity of Mecos. 

 The young differ from those of atratus and ganinus in being carinate; 

 the early whorls of the spire enlarge more regularly, and the color is 

 a dull horn or light shade of brown without the polish of the young 

 atratus. 



Taken from the bed of the river in a moderate current, and sheltered 

 pools where there was no current. 



Mecos falls are a number of small falls and rapids where the Yalles 

 River comes from the mountains to the valley. Standing on the 

 railroad track and looking east and a little to the right, Yalles can be 

 seen as a spot in the valley, and still farther in the next range of moun- 

 tains is seen the rock face of the cut through which the railroad passes 

 and in which lies the village of El Abra. 



Paohyoheilus humerosus n. sp. PI. XXIII, figs. 21-2.3. 



The shell is ovate-turrited, solid, black with pale spiral bands on 

 the ridges, the cuticle smooth and dense. Spire acuminate when not 

 eroded, the earliest whorls (in young shells) clear brownish, first 5 

 whorls smooth and not very convex, then two spiral ridges appear, 

 rapidly becoming stronger, a third ridge appearing below the suture 

 about the 8th whorl, and sometimes others between the primary ridges. 

 A specimen 9 mm. long with S whorls has 7 spiral ridges on the last 

 whorl, each showing as a white band within the aperture. One 15 mm. 

 long with whorls has 7 such ridges and bands on the last whorl. The 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 527 



whorls then enlarge very rapidly, the suture deepens. On the penulti- 

 mate whorl of an adult there are about 5 spiral pale ridges, the lower 

 ones wider and lower. On the last whorl the ridges weaken, leaving 

 it smooth or nearly so, or they may persist below the suture and at the 

 base; the suture becomes very deep, the whorl below it horizontal, shoul- 

 dered, the shoulder bounded by a ridge or angle. The aperture is 

 rounded-ovate, blackish within but pale or banded in the throat; 

 outer and basal margins thin, black, broadly rounded; inner margin 

 more or less straightened, appressed or free and continuous, brown at 

 the edge, the callus white. 3^ to 6 whorls usually may be counted in 

 adult shells.

Tamosopo River, near Verastagu, above and below the "Natural 

 Bridge." 



The light colored cords alternating with purple-black bands makes 

 it a conspicuous shell when seen in the water. While the general 

 shape is that of P. atratus, this species differs from that by its con- 

 spicuous sculpture. It is more allied to P. tristis, though very distinct. 



Pachycheilus monachus n. sp. PI. XXIV, figs. 21-25. 



The shell is solid, cylindric with conic spire, or turrite-conic, black. 

 The earliest whorls appear to be smooth; then sharp spiral cords much 

 narrower than their intervals appear, evenly spaced, and five on each 

 whorl; these disappear on the last two whorls, or one to three persist 

 only below the suture, where the whorl is more or less tumid or shoul- 

 dered. The spire is rather long and conic; suture deep; last whorl 

 convex or flattened laterally. The aperture is ovate, whitish inside, 

 black near the lip. Outer lip sharp and strongly arcuate. Columellar 

 lip more straightened, heavily white-calloused, usually brownish at 

 the edge.

Coy River, three miles south of Los Palmas. State of San Luis

The Coy River issues from a cave at the foot of the mountain below

the railroad track. Specimens taken near the cave and a short distance 

 within average smaller than those taken lower down the stream, but 

 agree with them in other characters. They measure 20 to 28 mm. 

 long. 



P. nwnachus has some resemblance to P. a. suprastriatus, but in 

 that the spiral striae are coarser and less regular, the aperture is less 

 angular above, and projects more laterally beyond the outline of the 

 cone, as in P. atratus. 



Pachycheilus vallesensis Hinkley. 



Nautilus, XXI, p. 25, pi. 5, figs. 1-3, 5-7, 10 (July, 1907). 



This species was taken in the Valles River at Valles; most abundant 

 where there is but little current. Also at the ranch of C. P. Willis. In 

 all kinds of situations. In some places the young were very numerous. 

 The largest ones were on rocks and in the bed of the river where there 

 was little or no current. The large typical form also occurred in the 

 Panuco River at Pujal, on a rock outcrop in the bed of the river. 

 This is a wide shallow stream in which there is a large amount of 

 shifting sand. Few shells were found where the stream was visited. 



Very large shells, some 37^ x 18£ mm., were taken in the Moctezuma 

 River at the ford, in the bed of the stream. 



P. vallesensis differs from the other stout species of the region by 

 its bluish, ashy or blackish-gray color, reminding one of Goniobasis 

 livescens, and by the white columellar callus. 



Pachyoheilus vallesensis attenuates n. subsp. 



The shell is livid bluish when clean, smaller and much more slender 

 than vallesensis, with a comparatively longer spire. Whorls 8 or 9, 

 the upper ones weakly striate spirally, last whorl smooth. Aperture 

 ovate, acutely angular above. Parietal callus thick and white, the 

 appressed edge often yellowish or brownish.

Chaimai Creek (about halfway between Valles and Pujal) and 

 Casas Viejas River, a tributary of the Valles River, coming from the 

 north of Valles, and emptying into the Valles River some miles east of 

 Mecos falls. 



These shells were at first thought to be P. suprastriatus, but they 

 differ in the striae of the young being finer and more numerous; there 

 is also a difference in the aperture and columellar callus, and the outer 

 lip is never extended beyond the line of the spire as in suprastriatus. 



In 1907 this form was included in the description of P. vallesensis 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 529 



and figured (see Nautilus, Vol. 21, figs. 4, 8 and 9 of pi. 5). They are 

 more acute in the spire and thinner than typical vallesensis, also smaller. 

 The shells taken the past winter were from farther up the stream than 

 those taken two years before. Not one could be found at the place 

 where they were then. 



Chaimai Creek is about two miles down the Valles River from the 

 Willis ranch (where typical P. vallesensis occurs), and begins with a 

 spring about a mile from the river. The water of the spring is a little 

 warm and the pool there contains no Pachycheilus. Lower down they 

 were often on and among decaying leaves. 



Pachycheilus suturalis n. sp. PI. XXIV, figs. 16-20. 



The shell is turrited, regularly and slowly tapering, moderately solid 

 though rather thin, black, blackish-brown or brown. In perfect 

 shells the first (embryonic) 2% whorls are smooth and convex; four or 

 five following whorls have an acute carina below the middle, with an 

 acute thread above and one below it ; on subsequent whorls the carina 

 is reduced and the number of spiral threads increases, so that there is 

 a brief stage of about one whorl where the convex surface has about 

 6 subequal spirals; the lower spirals then diminish, leaving the last 

 3 or 4 whorls nearly smooth except for a group of usually three or four 

 spiral cords just below the suture. Some weak traces of spiral stria? may 

 often be seen on the smoothish portion, under the lens. The aperture 

 is broadly ovate, narrower above, but rounded there in adults, broadly 

 rounded below. The peristome is thin, blackish, noticeably retracted 

 just below the columella, and the outer lip is sinuous, being somewnat 

 retracted above. The parietal callus is brown or blackish, rather 

 heavy.

 the mountains to the Moctezuma River; all in the State of San Luis

This species is related to P. pleurotoma, which differs chiefly by its 

 Pleurotomoid sinus. The only other related species is P. saussurei 

 (Brot), 3 of which two of the original lot, received from Dr. Brot, are

530 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Nov., 



in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. 

 In P. saussurei several whorls following the embryonic shell are convex 

 and smooth, not keeled as in P. suturalis; and lower down the whorls 

 have in addition to the snbsutural group of striae a weak longitudinal 

 plication, which is wanting in P. suturalis. 



The largest examples are from a creek about a mile above the ford 

 of the Moctezuma River. Two measure:

Those from the creek at Coxcantlan are not quite so large as the 

 type lot, and the shells from the two rills in the mountains are small ; 

 those from the first rill have the lip slightly expanded, and are quite 

 slender, measuring:

They live in the same stream with P. pleurotoma, but were not noticed 

 feeding with that species, seeming to prefer the rocks where there is 

 considerable current. 



Those from the second rill are slightly larger and less slender, about 

 21 x 10 mm. 



Pachycheilus pleurotoma n. sp. PI. XXIV, figs. 13 15. 



The shell is slender, turrited or spire-shaped, rather thin, hair-brown 

 or greenish-olive. Spire long, slightly attenuate above. The earliest 

 whorls are smooth and rounded ; then some spiral threads appear, one 

 near the lower suture rapidly increasing to a projecting carina, with one 

 thread below, one to three above it; this stage continuing 3 or 4 

 whorls. The carina then disappears, leaving the whorls rounded with 

 about 5 threads, and sometimes a low, indistinct longitudinal plication. 

 The spiral threads then disappear, leaving the last 2 to 4 whorls convex 

 and smooth except for 3 or 4 spiral cords just below the suture. The last 

 whorl usually becomes a little shouldered near the aperture. The 

 aperture is small, very broadly ovate, being somewhat narrower but 

 rounded above. The outer lip, close below the suture, is retracted 

 to form a deep rounded sinus, much as in the marine genus Drillia. 

 Elsewhere the lip is thin and simple. The basal lip is broadly rounded. 

 Columellar margin straightened or much less arched than the outer 

 margin, moderately thickened. 



Length 36 J, diam. 12^, length of aperture 1H mm.; whorls 10.

 there was little or no current and seemed to be feeding on decaying 

 vegetation, chiefly on fruit of the wild orange. 



This species is distinguished from others of its group by the deep 

 Pleurotomoid notch. In Pachycheilus this structure is known only 

 in P. dalli Pils., a species very different in other characters. Perfect- 

 shells may have as many as 12 whorls, but the tip is generally Inst in 

 adults.

UNIONIDJE OF THE PANUCO RIVER SYSTEM, MEXICO. 

 BY HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



The extensive river system emptying by the Panuco River into the 

 Gulf of Mexico at Tampico has a rich mollusk fauna, in which tire 

 Melaniidce and Unionidce are particularly well developed. A few of 

 the mussels were collected by Dr. Blanding many years ago and 

 described by Dr. Isaac Lea. Many more were taken by Mr. A. A. 

 Hinkley in January and February of the present year. All of the 

 species known from the Panuco drainage are included in the following 

 list. The localities mentioned may be found on the map, p. 520. 



Only four Panuco species are now known to extend southward into 

 the rivers of the neighborhood of Vera Cruz. There is more affinity 

 with the fauna of the Rio Salado. 



The generic relationships of eastern Mexican Unionidce are very 

 uncertain, since Simpson, in his great systematic work, knew the 

 soft parts of very few Mexican forms, and there are no definite generic 

 characters in the shells alone distinguishing the genera Unio, Nephro- 

 naias and Lampsilis. Some species which have been referred to the 

 two former genera seem to me to belong to Lampsilis. Under these 

 circumstances, it will be understood that the generic references herein 

 are made with reserve, and subject to revision by those who may study 

 these mussels in the flesh.

My record of this species from Rio Tuliga in Tabasco, copied into

 only the Panuco locality on record for the species, though related

 Taken from crevices in the bed of the stream, where the water was 

 deep and the current so strong that it was difficult to hold one's posi-

The shells in this place were so badly eroded that a third were 

 discarded. 



This species was described from the State of Vera Cruz. It has 

 been united with medellinus by Mr. Simpson, and with aztecorum by 

 von Martens, but I think it specifically distinct.

"At Valles the water was very shallow, and nearly the whole bed of 



the stream could be waded. The shells were found between and under 



rocks in mid-stream, and a few were taken from a muddy bank across 



the river from the town." This fine Lampsilis is related to L. strebeli 



on the one side, to L. discus on the other.

 of the island. In this part of the stream quite a bed of this species 

 was found." (A. A. H.) 



The type locality is the Rio Moctezuma. The varieties described 

 by Prof, von Martens cannot be sustained. They occur together 

 and fully intergrade. It is a magnificent species, one of the largest 

 in Lampsilis. The nacre may be white, salmon or purple.

Lampsilis moctezumensis n. sp. PI. XXV, figs. 1, 2, 3, 4. 



The shell is oblong, the dorsal and ventral margins both arched, the 

 former a little more so; altitude decidedly more than half the length, 

 diameter more than one-third the length; moderately strong but not 

 thick. The beaks are small and low. near the anterior fourth of the 

 length. In young shells they show one or two low, short undulations, 

 being nearly smooth. Color yellowish brown. Adult shells hardly 

 showing rays, even by transmitted light, but the young have narrow 

 green rays posteriorly, on a yellow ground, marked with dark concentric 

 streaks. Both ends are rounded. Sculpture of growth-wrinkles only, 

 weak on the middle of the valve, but rather emphatic anteriorly. The 

 interior is white, the nacre thinner and iridescent posteriorly. The 

 pseudocardinal teeth are moderately stout, blunt and nearly smooth. 

 In the left valve the posterior cardinal is larger than the anterior. 

 In the right valve the single cardinal is small. The lateral teeth are 

 short and widely separated from the cardinals. The cavity of the 

 beaks are rather deep.

in the length. The surface is smoothish except for growth-lines which 

 are strongest near the lower margin and anterior end. Color various 

 shades of brown, with rather indistinct darker or greenish rays, chiefly 

 on the posterior half. The beaks are low, at the anterior fifth of the 

 length. When perfect they have double-looped concentric sculpture. 

 Valves thin, lined with nacre which is whitish in the cavity and anter- 

 iorly, but pink and very iridescent posteriorly (sometimes suffused 

 with pink throughout, darker and purplish below the pallial line, or 

 sometimes silvery white throughout) . Pseudocardinal teeth compressed, 

 rather small; lateral teeth very short, about one-third the shell's 

 length. Ligament short.

In the Valles River at Mecos the shells are rather small and not 

 incrusted; nacre white, iridescent posteriorly, but not suffused there 

 with pink or purple. Some of the half-grown specimens are quite

 L. semirasa differs from L. signata and L. undivaga by lacking 

 corrugation on the convexity of the valves and on the posterior-dorsal 

 slope. It apparently lives with the shell nearly half buried, somewhat 

 more than the posterior half projecting, and in most localities covered 

 with a hard calcareous coat, as in pi. XXVI, fig. 9. Fig. 7 represents

Lampsilis signata n. sp. PI. XXV, figs. 5, 6. 



The shell is oblong with subparallel dorsal and ventral borders, 

 twice as long as wide, the diameter contained about three times in the 

 length. The anterior border is rounded, posterior border truncate 

 below, sloping and more or less convex from the truncation to the 

 posterior end of the hinge. In some specimens the posterior truncation 

 is indistinct, or that extremity may be rounded. The beaks are low 

 and situated near the anterior fourth of the shell's length. Adult 

 shells are blackish, but by transmitted light numerous green rays may 

 be seen, fading out towards the lower border; and when unworn the 

 beaks shows a pretty pattern of distinct green rays on a pinkish or 

 creamy ground. The surface has but little gloss; the cuticle is rough- 

 ened by growth-lines, which near the edge and on the posterior slope 

 often form cuticular laminae; the middle part of the valves is smoother, 

 but marked with one or more small patches of short corrugations, at right 

 angles to the growth-lines, and near the beaks there are some acute 

 fine radial wrinkles on the posterior-dorsal slope. 



The beaks are sculptured with two radial series of short concentric 

 wrinkles separated by a slight depression. The valves are rather 

 thick in the anterior half, becoming abruptly thinner posteriorly. 

 The nacre is purple, fading in the cavity, or bluish white, becoming 

 purplish and iridescent posteriorly. The pseudocardinal teeth are 

 stout, the anterior one in the left valve wedge-shaped, a rather broad 

 rugose heel below it, the posterior one lying directly under the beak; 

 lateral teeth double as usual. The right valve has a stout, rugose 

 pseudocardinal with a fossa and then a very small, compressed laminar 

 tooth above it; lateral tooth single.

 rays. The anterior end is rounded, posterior end more or less truncate 

 below, sloping steeply above. Surface of the valves with sculpture 

 of distinct growth-lines, and sometimes having a patch of very indis- 

 tinct vertical corrugations near the posterior ridge on the most convex 

 portion. There is also some fine oblique corrugation on the posterior-

dorsal slope near the beaks, when not worn off. Beaks low, between 

 the anterior fifth and sixth of the length; when perfect the tip is acute 

 and sculptured with a series of short folds on the posterior ridge. The 

 interior is fleshy-purplish, iridescent posteriorly; nacre in the anterior 

 half is very thick, posteriorly thin. Cavity of the beaks deep and 

 angular. The pseudocardinal teeth are stout, otherwise formed as in 

 L. signata; laterals curved.

Valles River two miles above Mecos, in a muddy bank just above 

 rapids. 



This species is closely related to L. signata, but the valves are thicker 

 and heavier, the teeth are heavier, and the proportions differ. It is 

 apparently related to L. aztecorum (Phil.), 1 but that is described as 

 thin, "valvulis satis tenuibus," whereas in L. undivaga the valves are 

 quite heavy and strong for a Lampsilis of this size. 



The nacre is nearly white in a few examples. It abruptly becomes 

 thick in the posterior half of the shell. Young shells are conspicuously 

 rayed with green. 



One young shell from the Valles River at Valles (pi. XXVII, fig. 5), 

 seems to belong to this species, though I am not quite sure of the 

 identity. It is 41 mm. long, yellowish, nearly covered with green rays, 

 the nacre is pale purple, with a wide darker purple margin posteriorly. 



Lampsilis novileonis n. sp. PI. XXVII, figs. 1, 2. 



The shell is oblong, rather compressed, the upper and basal margins 

 slightly and about equally arcuate, anterior end rounded, posterior 

 end sloping above, truncate and somewhat biangular below, beaks 

 at the anterior two-sevenths of the length. The surface is convex, 

 without angle or ridge bounding the posterior slope, not very glossy, 

 smoothish for the greater part, but on the posterior slope there is 

 some oblique corrugation in the upper part of the disk. The epidermis 

 is yellow, sparsely marked in the posterior half with narrow green 

 rays. The very low beaks are eroded in the type specimen. The interior 

 is white, thicker anteriorly, very gradually becoming thinner at the 

 posterior end, where opalescent tints are beautifully produced. The 

 cavity of the beak is rather deep. The lateral teeth are short and 

 rather widely separated from the stout cardinals, which are double 

 and about equally prominent in the left valve.

Casas Viejas River, State of San Luis Potosi. 



With some resemblance to L. moctezumensis, this species differs by 

 the slight corrugation of the posterior slope and the more compressed 

 form. Some young specimens (pi. XXVII, fig. 7) from the type locality, 

 which seem referable to this species, have the whole valves ornamented 

 with wide green rays. The beaks have a minute area sculptured with 

 about four concentric wrinkles, which are very weakly bilobed. Outside 

 of this sculptured portion the green rays are very distinct, as in allied 

 species. A faint rib or green stripe radiates from the beak in the 

 middle of the posterior slope, which is in part obliquely corrugated. 

 These specimens measure from 17^ to 36 mm. long. 



Lampsilis coyensis n. sp. PI. XXVII, figs. 3, 4. 



The shell is oblong, with beaks at the anterior fourth of its length ; 

 slightly wider posteriorly, the posterior end sloping above, bi angular 

 below; anterior end rounded; basal outline moderately curved, convex. 

 There is a rather distinct angulation from the beak towards the 

 posterior-basal angle, and the indistinct trace of a ridge to the posterior- 

 median angle. The beaks are low, with minute, recurved tips sculp- 

 tured with a few coarse double-festooned wrinkles, the connection 

 between the two curves almost interrupted. The sculptured portion 

 is not quite two mm. long. Subsequent growth is marked with growth- 

 lines only, or with a very slight oblique corrugation in places on the 

 posterior slope. The epidermis is rather smooth but not gloss}^ and 

 is shortly and finely lamellose towards the margins. Color obscure 

 greenish yellow, indistinctly marked all over with green rays. Near 

 the beaks the rays are very distinct on a light ground. By transmitted 

 light it is light yellowish, very profusely marked with green rays. 

 The interior is white and somewhat thick anteriorly, thin, blue and 

 slightly iridescent in the posterior half. The teeth are moderately 

 strong. 



Length 36, alt. 21, diam. 13.5 mm. 



Coy River, State of San Luis Potosi, Mexico, collected by Mr. A. A. 

 Hinkley, January, 1909. 



These Lampsilis from the Coy River were found where there was a 

 long mosslike plant growing, the current of the stream keeping it 

 in a constant waving motion. The water was two to four feet deep. 

 The Lampsilis were found by feeling in the roots of this moss. 



On the moss and bed of the stream were Pachycheilus and Litha- 

 siopsis, but the former were more numerous lower down the stream 

 in a small recess where there was no current. In this recess were also 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 539 



found the small species taken in this stream. They were in the sedi- 

 ment, and on water plants and near the water's edge. The stream is 

 clear, deep and with a strong current. 



This may turn out to be a small, rayed variety of L. novileonis, yet 

 specimens from 28 to 36 mm. long have every appearance of adult 

 shells. The cardinal teeth in the left valve are stouter and their crests 

 are more united than in L. novileonis. 



While L. undivaga, coyensis and novileonis are closely related species, 

 they seem, with present material, to be distinct. 

 Lampsilis metallica ganina "- subsp. PI. XXVII, fig. 0. 



The shell resembles L. metallica (Say) (Unio cuprinus Lea) in 

 general appearance, but is constantly smaller, more compressed and 

 more reniform. Near the beaks there are green rays on a pale ground, 

 the rest of the valve being brownish black.

The epidermis is very glossy anteriorly, but dull and shortly lamellose

 up and interrupted in the middle, as though scored upward when soft. 

 These peculiar markings occur on some other species of Glabaris, and 

 are constant in all the specimens of G. strebeli I have seen from Vera 

 Cruz and San Luis Potosi. The anterior end of the shell has a sculpture 

 of threads along the lines of growth. The sinulus, or glossy area at 

 the posterior end of the hinge-line, is triangular, pointed below, as in 

 Glabaris. not shallow, as in Anodonta; so that Mr. Simpson's reference 

 of the species to Glabaris is justified. It ranges north farther than 

 any other species of the genus. G. cylindraccus (Lea), from the 

 Medellin River, is evidently an allied form.

NEW LAND SHELLS FROM MEXICO. 

 BY HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



Most of the species here described were collected by Mr. A. A. 



Hinkley early in 1909. The localities mentioned may be found marked 



on the map on p. 520. 



Schasicheila xanthia n. sp. Fig. 1. 



The shell is conic, thin, of a uniform maize yellow or pale lemon 



color, rather weakly marked with fine growth-striae ; whorls 4^, very 



convex, parted by a deep suture, the last whorl well rounded throughout, 



slightly descending at the aperture. Aperture 

 slightly oblique; outer lip very slightly ex- 

 panded. Inner lip straight, continuous. Colu- 

 mellar area small, white, the umbilical region 

 deeply impressed. The operculum is thin, 

 white, a little sunken at the nucleus, the lower 

 angle projecting in a short point beyond the 

 basal lip. 



Alt. 4.9, diam. 4.9 mm. 



Canyon below Las Canoas, State of San Luis Potosi, in crevices and 

 on ledges of the bluffs, under stones and debris. Types 99,024 A. N. 

 S. P. 



This snail is related to S. minuscula Pfr., but on comparison of 

 specimens it is seen that in the new form the spire is higher, more 

 acute, and the suture is deeper. The operculum is in place in the 

 figured type. 



Helicina vanattse n. sp. 



The shell is turbinate-globose, similar to H. chrysocheila Binn., 

 white, the upper whorls often flesh colored, the last whorl often having 

 a wide dull purplish or dull red band above the periphery, and partly 

 exposed above the suture on the spire; marked with a bright scarlet 

 streak behind the lip, with usually, in large shells, a more conspicuous 

 streak at the last third of the last whorl, and another on the penulti- 

 mate whorl. The spire is conic, apex rather acute. Whorls 6, slightly 

 convex, the last rounded peripherally. Sculpture of faint growth- 

 lines, very fine, close spiral striae (sometimes subobsolete), and very 

 weakly developed, short, forwardly-descending wrinkles. Aperture

quite oblique; peristome narrowly expanded, white, with a red streak 

 inside. Basal callus white, weak and small, having a small pit behind 

 the columellar lip. 



Alt. 9.5, diam. 10.5 mm. ; whorls 6. 



On the sides of the canyon below Los Canoas, San Luis Potosi, under 

 loose rocks and leaves on shelves and in crevices of the bluffs. Also 

 on the bluff near the mill of the Tamosopo Sugar Co., and on the side 

 of the highest peak south of Mecos falls. Types No. 99,025 A. N. S. P. 



This species differs from H. chrysocheila cniefiy in coloration, being 

 marked with scarlet streaks behind the lip and at former growth- 

 arrest periods, and in having a white lip, that of chrysocheila being 

 yellow, as tne name denotes. Some examples are very small, but 

 have an expanded lip, diam. only 8 mm., with 5 J whorls. The largest 

 specimen seen measures alt. 12.2, diam. 12.7 mm. 



Named for Mr. E. G. Vanatta. 



Polygyra matermontana jaliscoensis n. subsp. 



The shell is larger than P. matermontana, brown, the last whorl or 

 1£ whorls weakly rib-striate, with faint traces of spiral striae near the 

 periphery, previous whorls finely striate; umbilicus larger, the central 

 cavity well-like, contracting very slowly, more than half the total 

 width; at the last whorl the umbilicus expands rapidly, and has a 

 nearly vertical side wall. Whorls 6, the last very deeply and steeply 

 descending in front, and having a rather deep and long spiral furrow 

 within the umbilicus. The aperture is subhorizontal, the basal and 

 upper margins parallel; teeth somewhat larger than in typical mater- 

 montana, similar in shape, but the sinus between the outer and basal 

 teeth is a little narrower. 



Alt. 6, diam. 12, width of umbilicus 3 mm. 

 " 5.8, " 11, " " " 2.9 " 



Guadalajara, State of Jalisco, Mexico. Types No. 99,512 A. N. S. P. 



This form differs from matermontana in the coarser sculpture, wider 

 umbilicus which is more deeply grooved within, narrower last whorl 

 (viewed from above), more deeply descending at the aperture, etc. 

 It has a wider umbilicus than P. nelsoni Dall. 



A similar shell except that the color is pale yellowish-corneous with 

 a very faint supraperipheral band, and the sculpture of the last whorl 

 is not quite so coarse, was collected by Mr. C. H. T. Townsend at 

 Zapotlan, Jalisco, in July, 1902. It is evidently a very closely related 

 race. 

 Polygyra guadalajarensis n. sp. 



The shell is depressed, with slightly convex spire and moderate

umbilicus (contained about 4^ times in the diameter of shell), which is 

 well-like and enlarges very little at the last whorl, where but a very narrow 

 area of the preceding whorl is exposed. Surface glossy, marked with 

 growth-wrinkla*, more distinctly striate behind the lip; pale brown. 

 Whorls 4f to 5, convex, the last subangular in front of the aperture, 

 soon becoming rounded, with the periphery well above the middle; 

 it is deeply contracted behind the outer and basal lips, and descends 

 abruptly in front ; within the umbilicus it is flattened but not furrowed. 

 The aperture is transversely oblong. Parietal tooth Y-shaped both 

 branches curved, the outer one slender and nearly but not quite 

 reaching the upper termination of the lip; lower branch stronger, 

 nearly reaching the termination of the columellar lip. Within the outer 

 lip there is a compressed tubercle with a callous buttress or concave 

 plate above it. In the basal margin there is a similar compressed 

 tubercle, with a weak callus (scarcely a tooth) between it and the 

 columella. 



Alt. 4.2, diam. 8.8, width of umbilicus 2 mm.

Guadalajara, State of Jalisco. Types No. 99,513 A. X. S. P. 



Polygyra guadalajarensis n. sp. 



This species is related to P. ventrosula hindsi (Pfi\), from which it 

 differs chiefly by the much larger cavity of the umbilicus, which 

 enlarges at the last whorl less than in any of the related species known 

 to me. 



The two species described above belong to the group of P. ventrosula, 

 — the most difficult group of Mexican Polygyras. 



This group includes shells in which the parietal tooth is distinctly 

 V-shaped, and the outer lip has a well-developed concave plate or but- 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 543 



tress above and joined to the outer lip-tooth, basal lip with one or two 



teeth. The following species belong here: 



P. plagioglossa (Ph.) P. guadalajarensis Pils. 



P. suprazonata Pils. P. bicruris (Pfr.) 



P. couloni (Shuttl.) P. matermontana Pils. 



P. richardsoni Marts. P. mat. jaliscoensis Pils. 



P. richardsoni lingualis Pils. P. nelsoni Dall. 



P. ponsonbyi Pils. P. nelsoni collisella Dall. 



P. ventrosula (Pfr.) P. euglypta Pils. 



P. ventrosula hindsi (Pfr.) P. albicostulata Pils. 



Of these forms I have not seen P. bicruris and P couloni, or typical 

 specimens of P. ventrosula or richardsoni. 



This group of species is especially developed in western and northern 

 Mexico. Towards the southeast it is in large measure superseded by 

 the group of P. yucatanea, of which P. helictomphala is a common form. 

 In this group there is no distinct plate or buttress above the outer lip- 

 tooth, and the parietal tooth is reduced. 



Northward, the group of P. texasiana replaces the ventrosula group. 

 P. texasiana, P. triodontoides, P. mooreana, P. latispira and their 

 subspecies compose the texasiana group. 



The old records, on Sowerby's authority, of P. ventrosula and hindsi 

 from Texas must be erroneous. P. ariadnce, which forms another 

 group somewhat related to that of ventrosula, has been reported from 

 Texas, but it certainly has not been collected there recently. 



Polygyra oppilata implicata 'Beck' Martens. 



This is a common snail in the Panuco River basin. Dead shells are 

 abundant in river debris at Tampico. Living shells were found by 

 Mr. Hinkley inland. P. implicata has usually been ranked as a dis- 

 tinct species, but it differs from oppilata in only trifling details. When 

 fresh the shell is sparsely hairy. 



Mingled with implicata in the river debris, but probably from separate 

 localities or stations, there are specimens in which the upper angle 

 of the peristome is built out from the whorl, somewhat as in P. auricu- 

 lata; the two lip-teeth are slightly more developed, the space between 

 them being narrower. This form I have called P. o. complicata. 



P. oppilata has been reported from Florida ( Shuttl eworth), at Cedar 

 Keys (W. G. Binney) ; but some similar form of P. postelliana must 

 have been mistaken for it. Of about the same size, and belonging 

 to a closely related group of species, such a mistake might easily be 

 made. 



The Mexican group of P. ariadnce is composed of species in which 




544 



PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[Nov., 



there are two more or less compressed lip-teeth, a lamina or buttress 

 above the upper one, and a well-developed biramose parietal tooth, 

 both rami of which are strongly developed, more or less curved or 

 sinuous, and connect with the ends of the peristome, thereby differing 

 from species of the group of P. ventrosula. This group is very closely 

 related to Floridan forms, such as pustuloides, espiloca, auriformis, etc., 

 differing chiefly by the armature of the outer lip. The following 

 species are included: 



P. oppilata Morel P. aulacomphala Pils. and Hinkl. 



P. o. implicata 'Beck' Marts. P. rhoadsi Pils. 



P. o. complicata Pils. P. polita Pils. and Hinkl. 



P. ariadnce (Pfr.) 



Euglandina cymatophora n. sp. Fig. 3. 



The shell is cylindric-oblong, of a yellowish brown or fallow color, 

 very glossy. The apex is rounded; first 3^ whorls are smooth; the 



following whorls have short, regular folds 

 below the suture, distinct and rather strong 

 near the suture but rapidly becoming very 

 weak, the surface becoming smooth. On the 

 latter part of the last whorl strong, regular 

 folds continue to the base. The distance 

 from crest to crest of these folds is about 

 one millimeter. Besides this sculpture, there 

 are conspicuous places of growth-arrest, 

 marked by an impressed light line, preceded 

 by a darker streak, which follows a rather 

 wide opaque streak. There are three such 

 variceal marks on the last whorl of the type. The spire has 

 nearly straight outlines and a well impressed suture. The 

 whorls increased slowly and regularly to the last, which de- 

 scends more rapidly. The aperture is more than half the length 

 of the shell, its upper half very narrow. The outer lip retracts rather 

 strongly above, and arches forward in the middle. The columella is 

 moderately concave.

last whorl there are 3 or 4 striae in the space of 



a millimeter; they weaken downwards, and fade 



out below the middle of the whorl. Whorls 5^ to

FURTHER STUDIES ON THE ACTIVITIES OF ARANEADS, II. 



BY THOS. H. MONTGOMERY, JR. 



The following observations were made at Woods Hole, Mass., during 

 the Summer of 1909. For the identification of certain species my 

 thanks are due to Mr. Nathan Banks and to Prof. G. W. Peckham. 



1. The Process of Sperm-Induction. 



It will be recalled that Lister in 1678 discovered that the male 

 spider in coition applies his pedipalpal bulb to the genital aperture of 

 the female; and that Menge in 1843 found that the male charges his 

 palpi by depositing a drop of sperm upon a specially constructed 

 inclined sheeting, and then touching this drop with his palpal organs. 

 The latter process, termed by me sperm-induction, was seen by Menge 

 in Linyphia, Agelena, Tapinopa and Micrommata; by Blackwall 

 (1863) in Agelena; by Ausserer (1867) in Dicttjna and Linyphia; by 

 Bertkau (1875, 1876) in Philoica, Linyphia and Clubiona; by Westberg 

 (1900) in Linyphia; and by me (1903) in Tegenaria, Theridium, Dietyna 

 and two species of Lycosa. The exact literature references are given 

 in my paper of 1903; 1 consequently they need not be repeated here. 

 The process has been observed, accordingly, in only ten genera, repre- 

 sentatives of six families, so that the following new observations on 

 representatives of two other families are not without interest. It is 

 difficult to see this act, and success is obtained only by long con- 

 tinued watching of spiders kept in cages. 



The first species to be described is the common large Attid, Phidippus 

 purpuratus K. One male, No. 1524, was placed on 20 June in a cage 

 with two females, and copulated the same day with one of them. 

 The next day he avoided his mates, and at 5.32 P.M. was seen spinning 

 a small sheeting, from the floor to the side of the cage and inclined at 

 45°; four minutes later he deposited a minute drop of sperm upon it, 

 barely visible to the naked eye; then extending his body over the 

 sheeting, reached his palpi downward and backward, applying them in 

 alternation against the drop ; the palpal organs were pressed, not against

1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 549 



the free surface of the drop, but against the reverse surface of the 

 sheeting. At 5.43 he was interrupted by a feeding female, and he 

 moved away from the sperm-bridge with a minute droplet of sperm 

 at the apex of his right palpus and another left on the bridge. Another 

 d\ No. 1508, of the same species, copulated on 17 June, and the day 

 following was observed at the close of the sperm-induction at 7.10 P.M. ; 

 he had spun from one vertical wall of the cage to the other, in an angle, 

 a narrow transverse ribbon of silk, with its flattened surface in the 

 vertical plane; against this he placed his ventral surface, with his 

 cephalic end elevated and the abdomen flexed, applying his palpi 

 gently and alternately against that surface of the sperm-bridge directed 

 away from his body. He ceased at 7.15, went into a corner of the 

 cage and there rested quietly. With a hand lens a thin film of sperm 

 could be seen upon the bridge, and next day the sperm was found 

 with the aid of the compound microscope. The same male (1508) 

 copulated on 20 June in the morning, and at 6.20 P.M. was found 

 forming another sperm-bridge like the first; at 6.24 he dropped a 

 minute globule of sperm upon it, and then applied his palpi in alterna- 

 tion to it as in the preceding cases ; this palpal application lasted six 

 minutes, when he turned away, but he seemed to be prematurely 

 interrupted by the movements of a grasshopper. 



The other case was that of a male of Drassus neglectus (Keys.), 

 No. 1527. He and a 9 , No. 1528, were caught together in a closed 

 nest on 17 June, placed in a cage, and there he built a beautiful and 

 spacious saccular nest around both. On 23 June, at 11.37 A.M., he was 

 observed in nearly vertical position within this nest, moving the 

 ventral surface of his abdomen repeatedly against an inclined sperm 

 bridge built against the inner surface of the nest and with its upper 

 edge free. In half a minute he discharged a droplet of sperm upon it, 

 then lowered his body to bring his jaws about on a level with the upper 

 margin of the bridge, reached his palpi over this free margin and rubbed 

 them gently many times against the reverse side of the sperm-bridge. 

 One palpal bulb was thus rubbed at a time, then raised in the air 

 while the other was rubbed. The application of the palpi continued 

 for 17 minutes. 



In all the cases so far described there is quite general uniformity 

 in the process of sperm-induction; a special sperm-bridge is spun, a 

 droplet of sperm placed upon it on the side next the spider's body, 

 then the palpi applied alternately against the opposite side. The 

 cephalothoracal end is always raised. In the case of Phidippus, 

 No. 1508, this act was seen twice, each time after observed copulation, 




550 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec. , 



and since the process must have occurred before the first coition, this 

 particular individual must have accomplished the process at least 

 three times. But I have seen no evidence that a replenishing of the 

 palpal organ is necessary after each copulation ; the charging of them 

 is generally sufficient for a number of copulations, the number probably 

 varying with their duration. 



2. The Atypical Habits of Ariadna. 



In all cases of egg-laying so far known in Araneads the process is 

 strangely uniform even though the finished cocoons may differ greatly 

 in form and texture. A base is first spun, a drop of viscid secretion 

 emitted from the genital aperture upon it, the eggs discharged into 

 this drop, then a cover spun around the egg mass. I have watched 

 the details of this process in so many instances, and in such a variety 

 of forms (Aviculariids, Thomisids, Drassids, Lycosids, Epeirids, 

 Theridiids, Sicariids, Agelenids, Dictynids, Attids, Filistatids, Pisau- 

 rids), that I had come to believe it was the universal process in spiders. 

 But in the interesting Dysderid Ariadna (Pylorus) bicolor (Hentz) a 

 form was found that builds no cocoon at all, and that lays its eggs in 

 a drop of salivary secretion. 



This species is common in certain open fields at Woods Hole, where 

 it makes its nest on the under side of stones. No adult males were 

 found from early in June until the middle of September, when I ceased 

 my observations. It constructs a firm and rather tough silken tube, 

 up to nearly three inches in length in the case of large individuals, 

 quite viscid, so that foreign objects readily adhere to its outer surface. 

 Generally the tube has a single opening that flares outwards something 

 like a funnel, and has been figured and described by McCook 2 , but 

 sometimes there is an opening at each end, and this is not infrequent 

 in the case of nests spun in captivity. Kept in artificial cages the 

 spiders sometimes wander out of their nests at night; but for the most 

 part they remain within them, at the enlarged entrance, with the 

 three anterior pairs of legs extended forwards ready to seize prey and 

 drag it into the nest, — as well described by Hentz. 3 Frequently a 

 colony of them is found beneath a single stone, and then their nests 

 are sometimes contiguous with each other and with those of Phidippus 

 and Drassus; but they are not strictly colonial, for they are cannibals 

 whenever an opportunity offers. In captivity they appear to spin

1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 551 



usually between midnight and dawn. A nest is the product of several 

 days of labor and is probably added to and lengthened from time to 

 time. The spiders can barely walk upon smooth glass, even when hori- 

 zontal. They feed within their nests and remove the remains of the 

 food outside. They exhibit death-feigning to a considerable degree. 



To observe the egg-laying a number of individuals were isolated 

 in small vials; groups of others were also placed in large cages each 

 made of two glass panes 12 x 8 inches, separated by a wooden frame 

 I inch thick; food could be introduced and air provided by holes in 

 the wooden frame. 



No egg masses were found in wild nests before 2P June, and the 

 individuals observed had not oviposited. 



The oviposition is carried out within the nest. The entire process was 

 seen in the case of two individuals, and parts of it in other instances. 

 It may be described from the case of 1534 B, caught and placed in a 

 cage on 26 June. On 4 July she spent the afternoon spinning against 

 the inner surface of her nest, thickening it, but making no special cocoon 

 base. At 6 P.M. she became quiet except for a movement of the 

 palpi against the jaws that I first interpreted as a cleaning operation, 

 but watching her attentively with a hand lens, I saw that both palpi 

 were flexed, their free ends rubbing her chelicera rather slowly but 

 regularly, and at 6.11 a minute drop of fluid could be seen at the apices 

 of the chelicera. The two palpi steadily continued to rub the jaws, 

 the chelicera and maxilla? moving backwards and forwards as well 

 as opening and closing, and the drop slowly increased in volume by the 

 addition to it of droplets that merged with it; the drop was viscid, as 

 shown by its form, and evidently issued from the vicinity of the 

 mouth. Thus the drop slowly grew in size, and was slowly pushed 

 caudad beneath her cephalothorax, until it extended like an ovate 

 pearl from the mouth back to the anterior border of the abdomen; it 

 was transparent at the periphery, but more opaque in the centre, 

 while the newly issuing droplets, to be added to it, were all transparent. 

 Consequently the opacity of the interior may have been due to a 

 change in consistency. This process lasted continuously from 6.11 to 

 6.37, then the abdomen was quickly flexed downward slightly, and the 

 viscid drop suddenly clouded — due to successive discharge of the eggs 

 into it. This discharge of the eggs occupied almost 3 minutes. The 

 spider then commenced to sway her body slowly back and forth over 

 the egg mass in the drop, and continued to do so for almost an hour. 

 This movement was the attempt to free her chelicera and the ventral 

 surface of her cephalothorax from the surface of the viscid drop. The 




552 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



spider was horizontal, dorsum uppermost, the feet fixed against the 

 inner surface of the nest. 



Another female (1534 C) occupied the time from 7.45-8.16 P.M. 

 to produce the viscid drop. Another one (1534 D) worked from 

 5.54-6.32 P.M. to make the drop, occupied 5 minutes in the discharge 

 of the eggs into it, then took more than an hour to free herself from it. 



In not a single instance of the egg masses laid in captivity (13 cases) 

 was either a special base spun for the egg mass or a cover spun around 

 it. The inner surface of the nest serves as a base, there is no silken 

 cover, but the eggs are held together insecurely by the hardening of 

 the salivary drop ; insecurely, because the egg mass readily rolls out of 

 the nest, and the eggs are easily shaken apart by light handling. 



It remains to be determined just what glands furnish the viscid 

 drop into which the eggs are discharged. It may be composed of a 

 secretion issuing from the mouth, or from the impaired gland of the 

 rostrum or the salivary glands of the maxillary plates. 4 



Of the 13 timed egg masses deposited in captivity, 8 were made 

 between 6 and 8 P.M., 3 about 5 P.M., and only 1 in the early morning. 



The time from egg laying to hatching is unusually long in this species, 

 at least for eggs laid in the summer. 5 If we consider as hatching the 

 time when the spiderlings first commence locomotion, the 8 timed 

 cases in Ariadna presented time intervals between egg laying (in last 

 week of June and first week of July) and hatching of from 63-70 days. 



Not more than one egg mass was made by any of my captives, and 

 to test whether any individuals may oviposit twice in the same year 

 I caught on 22 August 9 females, each from a nest with a single mass 

 of eggs or young, and kept them together in a large cage until 12 Septem- 

 ber, but no further eggs were laid. Since the first eggs are laid after 

 the middle of June and do not hatch until September, and since the 

 middle of September brings in cooler weather, it seems probable that 

 they oviposit only once in a year — a condition rare in spiders. 



It is general, though not invariable, that at the time of oviposit ion 

 the spider closes the entrance to the nest by spinning over it, and all 

 my captives that had so closed their nests kept them sealed until 

 after the young had hatched. How long the young remain in the nest 

 after hatching was not determined. But wild spiders, in natural

conditions, always seem to have an opening to the nest even when 

 the eggs or young are in it. 



Ariadna thus resembles its congener Dysdera in having no special 

 cocoon for the eggs, 6 though both build nests. This would suggest 

 that the nest may be a racially older structure than the cocoon, and 

 that the Dysderids may be one of the most primitive groups of living 

 araneads. 7 The use of a mouth or salivary secretion to agglutinate 

 the eggs has never been seen before in spiders, though Bertkau (1884, 

 I. c.) has described such a process for the acarine Ixodes. 



3. The Habits of Pisaurina. 



The Pisauridse closely resembles the Lycosidse in structure, but 

 differ from them in being arboreal during the cocooning season rather 

 than terrestrial, and in carrying the cocoon by the chelicera and not 

 suspended from the spinnerets. 



The fullest account of the habits of any Pisaurid is given for the 

 European Dolomedes ftmbriatus Clerk by Pappenheim. 8 He saw the 

 cocooning only once; a spider spun a funnel-shaped cylinder of silk, 

 the closed roof of which was the upper surface of the glass cage; "in 



the cavity so bounded the eggs were laid Immediately after 



the oviposition the cocoon, that was at first cylindrical, took on gradually 

 the form of a hollow sphere from its continuous working by the extremi- 

 ties and the abdomen." Pappenheim does not make it clear whether 

 he saw the actual egg discharge and cocooning, or only the finishing 

 of the cocoon within an infundibular nest, but apparently he saw only 

 the latter. No other naturalist has described the cocoon-making for 

 any member of the family. 



Pisaurina mira (Walck.), more generally known as Ocyale (Microm- 

 mata) undata (Hentz), is unusually abundant in the woodland at 

 Woods Hole, even at places far removed from water, though those 

 kept in cages require water daily. Males are very rare (I have seen 

 only one, from the collection of Mr. Emerton), and not a single one was 

 found during the past summer. The large, white, globular cocoons of 

 this species are well known, and so are the nests that the mother spins 

 around the young at the time of hatching, and have been sufficiently

described by Emerton, 9 McCook (I. c.) and myself (1903), and have 

 been figured by the last two. But their method of construction has not 

 yet been described, nor has any reference been made to a curious nest 

 in which the cocoon is placed and which may be called the "cocoon- 

 nest/' in distinction from the "progeny-nest." 



The Cocoon-nests. — These are found most frequently, as are the 

 progeny-nests, on the poison-ivy (Rhus toxicodendron), where three 

 terminal leaves are spun together to serve as a roof. The cocoon-nests 

 are much less frequent than the others, and most of the spiders carrying 

 cocoons in their jaws are not in such nests; therefore, it is probable 

 they are vacated by the spider before the hatching of the young, for 

 I have found the majority of the nests without spiders in them. The 

 wild nests are each an arched or bellied sheeting of silk placed in the 

 shelter of the under side of three poison-ivy leaves, each such sheeting 

 varying in dimensions from 1 x 1\ inches to about 2 x 2\ inches accord- 

 ing to the size of the mother (which varies greatly), and with two or 

 three apertures at its margins. Two of the spiders only of those that 

 formed cocoons in captivity constructed cocoon-nests, and each of 

 them not until three or four days after the cocoon was formed; these 

 two nests were beautiful inverted domes, fastened to the glass roofs 

 of the cages with a wide aperture below of about two inches diameter. 

 The latter two nests were quite unlike the natural cocoon-nests found 

 in the woods, and seemed to represent an attempt on the part of the 

 spider to replace the roofing of ivy-leaves; it was probably a similar 

 construction that Pappenheim observed in the case of Dolomedes. 

 The cocoon-nests found in the state of nature are probably receptacles 

 constructed by the spider in which to make her cocoon, and indeed 

 the most heavily pregnant female caught was taken from such a nest. 

 The Cocooning. — Spiders are found with cocoons in early June, and 

 they construct at least two during the summer. The cocoons vary much 

 in diameter, are held by the mother by her chelicera and pedipalpi 

 and also frequently by one or more pairs of legs, and are at the same 

 time generally fastened by a few lines to the cocoon-nest or to the plant 

 on which she lives. They are rarely left by the mother before the 

 young hatch. Nine females were kept isolated in large glass cages for 

 the observation of the cocooning; six of them made cocoons, all con- 

 structed in the early morning hours between midnight and 7 A.M. 

 This particular time of the day is unfortunate for the observer, for after 

 midnight one naturally seeks repose. But in one case a considerable

1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 555 



portion of the process was seen, as follows: Female No. 1571 was 

 caught 31 July in a natural cocoon-nest. Placed in a cage she spun 

 some lines that night, and on 2 August spun quite a network of lines 

 from 7.30 P.M. up to 1 A.M., frequently stopping to bite lines that 

 impeded her movements and taking the relatively long period of from 

 several seconds to half a minute to make a line attachment. On 

 5 August at 3.10 A.M. I found her in the act of beginning the cover 

 to a freshly laid mass of eggs. She had constructed a flat scaffolding 

 of silk, inclined at an angle, extending from a twig to the wall of the 

 cage. The egg mass had been laid upon this scaffolding, and probably 

 only a short time previously, for the eggs were but thinly covered with 

 silk. The cocoon was not regularly circular in outline, but irregularly 

 polygonal, and its diameter was less than the length of the spider. 

 When first seen she was holding its edges with her feet and was appfying 

 the thread by raising and lowering the abdominal apex, and this 

 method she pursued throughout, which accounts for the cocoon being 

 loose in texture and with no dense outer layers. 10 When she had 

 accomplished spinning the cover to the eggs the cocoon had the form 

 of a plano-convex lens, quite different from the spherical shape when 

 fully completed. At 3.55 she commenced to free the margins of the 

 cocoon from the scaffolding by biting certain threads, mainly of the 

 lower portion, of the scaffolding, alternating (for 10 minutes) this biting 

 with spinning on the surface so freed. At 4.10 she fastened a line 

 from the cocoon to the roof, then continued her spinning. From 

 4.20-5.00 she was occupied in again biting the lines that held the 

 cocoon to the scaffolding, finally leaving the cocoon suspended by its 

 upper margin within a freed space. It had now become nearly 

 circular. 



The general process of cocooning is thus as described by me for 

 Lycosids, but different in that the upper margin of the cocoon is left 

 attached and suspended until after it is completed (in some cases this 

 attachment is maintained for a couple of days afterward), whereas 

 Lycosids finish their cocoons while held beneath their bodies. 



Hatching and Progeny-nests. — Of three cocoons made in confinement 

 (between 31 July and 6 August) and kept to hatching, the young- 

 emerged in 25, 26 and 30 days respectively. The mother holds the 

 cocoon until a day or two before the young hatch, then waits until the 

 first young come out before she makes the nest around them; none 



10 It need hardly be recalled that such application of the spinnerets always 

 produces architecture of soft consistency, while sweeping of the spinnerets 

 without elevation produces a firmer and tougher mesh. 




556 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



of my captives made the progeny-nest before emergence of the young. 

 As the young emerge the mother builds a network of lines around them, 

 she remaining on the outside of the nest, and increases the number of 

 the lines with the number of the young hatching. In this way the 

 progeny-nest, a real nursery, is gradually built around the spiderlings 

 and the empty cocoon, the mother working on it for as much as three 

 days. In natural conditions such nests are placed generally at a 

 height of about two feet above the ground, rarely as high as four feet , 

 most frequently on a terminal branch of poison-ivy or oak, or the 

 frond of a large fern, the leaves closely spun together to form a pro- 

 tecting and hiding roof over the network of lines below. The mother 

 seems to leave the nest and wander off shortly after she has completed 

 it; thus, on 2 August, I found about forty progeny-nests along a path in 

 the woods, and though fully half of them contained young the mother 

 was on the nest or in near vicinity to it in only two cases — and in these 

 two the young were in process of emergence from the cocoon. In the 

 one case timed the young left the nest on the ninth and tenth day 

 after hatching. 



The Mother's Abstinence from Food. — These relatively large spiders 

 are remarkably timorous, seeming to fear grasshoppers of a size that 

 much smaller spiders will quickly seize, and this timidity seems to be 

 increased in the periods when they are holding cocoons — possibly 

 because the maternal solicitude inhibits the desire for food, as it cer- 

 tainly impedes the search for it. All my captives drank water eagerly 

 each day, though still holding to the cocoon by the feet, but in most 

 cases refused all insect food until about the time when the young hatch ; 

 in most instances they made no attempt whatsoever to grasp insects 

 walking near them. Evidently it is the hunger for food that takes 

 them away so soon from the progeny-nest. The ability to undergo 

 long fasts is well known for the females of a number of species of 

 spiders, while males appear to need food at more frequent intervals — 

 just as they generally require more water. 



Effects of Removal of the Cocoon. — Females with cocoons, when caught 

 roughly and separated from their cocoons, will frequently feign death 

 admirably, lying quite limp and suffering handling without moving. 

 No case of death-feigning was seen in any individual holding a cocoon. 

 If the cocoon be returned to them within a few minutes they generally 

 grasp it immediately in their jaws and seek escape. But there may 

 well be individual differences in this behavior. Thus with a pencil 

 I removed the cocoon two inches away from one of my captives; she 

 showed no death-feigning, but walked about feeling for it. When I 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 557 



pushed it until it touched her she jumped away, and though she soon 

 thereafter felt it once or twice she each time sprang away and remained 

 quiet. I then pushed her gently so that one of her palpi rested on the 

 cocoon; she remained quiet in this position for a quarter of an hour, 

 then suddenly grasped it with her jaws and feet. In this case the 

 maternal instinct did not seem so strong as that of self-protection. 



4. Experiments to Determine Whether Lycosid Spiderlings 

 can Emerge Unaided from the Cocoon. 



It has previously been shown by me (1903, 1, c.) that Lycosid mothers 

 bite open the cocoon along the line of the junction of base and cover, 

 so as to allow the young to emerge. The following observations prove 

 conclusively that the young are unable to bite their own way out of 

 the cocoon : 



Twenty-nine cocoons were removed from as many females of a 

 small Pardosa, found running in a wood, and kept about six weeks on 

 my desk in open bottles out of the direct sunlight. In eleven of these 

 cocoons the young failed to hatch, due either to the handling of the 

 cocoons or to lack of fertilization of the eggs ; while in eighteen the young 

 hatched normally, but failed to emerge, died and shrivelled. In two 

 cocoons taken from females of Lycosa lepida and kept in the same way 

 the young also hatched, but died within the cocoons. 



5. Apparent Mimicry and Stridtjlation in Certain Drassids. 



Geotrecha (Thargalia) bivittata (Keys.), G. pinnata Emerton, and 

 G. crocata (Keys.) are found fairly abundantly during the summer 

 running on the ground in cloudy weather, crocata more in open fields 

 and the others in shaded places in the woods. The first two resemble 

 rather closely in form and movements the macroergates of a large 

 mound-building ant; and the particular locality at which I found 

 bivittata and pinnata most abundant was within twenty feet of such 

 an ant nest,— there being found also many wingless nymphs of the 

 hemipteron Alydus, which also resemble this ant. This seems to 

 constitute a complex case of mimicry. But when these ants are placed 

 together with individuals of Geotrecha they quickly bite and kill the 

 latter, so that the ants are not in any way deceived and there is no 

 myrmecophily. 



In defining the genus Geotrecha Emerton states, in speaking of the 

 abdomen: "It sometimes has a small, hard patch at the front end 

 which is of the same color as the rest of the back and not easily seen." 

 This I have found in all three species mentioned, where it occurs at 




55S PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



the antero-dorsal aspect of the abdomen and is a thickened chitinous 

 plate, slightly protuberant, of oval form. Now these species all show 

 a peculiar movement of the abdomen, such as I have never seen so 

 pronounced in any other spiders; they raise and lower the abdomen, 

 slightly rotating it on its pedicel, and continue this movement for 

 several seconds at a time. This movement is exhibited generally just 

 when the spider comes to rest after a run, and is exhibited equally by 

 both sexes. An individual frequently rotates the abdomen imme- 

 diately before starting on a run, on meeting another unexpectedly or 

 on coming into contact with a large living insect. It is sometimes seen 

 when the spider is quietly cleansing itself, but not when the cage is 

 given a sudden rap. The hardened abdominal plate at such times rubs 

 against the posterior border of the cephalothorax; accordingly, it is 

 a stridulation movement. But if any sound is produced it is quite 

 inaudible to the human ear, and if one individual stridulates in the 

 close vicinity of another the latter does not respond by any movement 

 whatsoever and therefore does not appear to be affected by any sound. 

 It is in no way a sexual call, for the male hunts the female and finds 

 her by touch, and neither he nor she stridulate during the mating. 

 The ants they resemble do not show this movement. 



This genus then exhibits a good case of stridulation, but if any 

 sound is produced thereby it seems to cause no effect on other individ- 

 uals and, therefore, is probably not perceived by them. The presence 

 of a stridulation apparatus need not imply the power of hearing in the 

 species concerned, and indeed the studies of Wagner and Pritchett seem 

 to have definitely determined that spiders do not possess hearing — 

 they possess in its place a most acute sense of touch. 



These spiders run with perfect ease on smooth glass. 



6. Notes on Modes of Copulation. 



Phidippus purpuratus K. 



The pairing was observed in 26 instances. The male stands over 

 the female, his ventral surface against her dorsal, their heads in oppo- 

 site directions, their body axes not in the same line, but his bent 

 obliquely toward one side of her abdomen. Only one palpus is inserted 

 at a time, and one alone may be employed through the act, or the two 

 may be alternated one or more times. The female remains motionless. 

 In the cases timed the act lasted less than one hour in 5 instances, and 

 more than one hour in 9 instances, the longest noted being more than 

 8 J hours continuously. It may occur in the morning (7 cases), after- 

 noon (11 cases), or after 6 P.M. (8 cases). The same pair have bee- 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 559 



seen to mate in captivity as many as 6 successive times, as the pair 

 <? 1500 x 9 1501 with copulation on 13, 20, 21 and 28 June, and 18 

 and 21 July; the same female has been seen to mate with two males, 

 and the same male with two females. In two instances females were 

 seen to copulate after making the first cocoon: thus 9 1519 mated 

 with c? 1518 on 20 and 21 June, cocooned 29 June, then mated with 

 c? 1519 A on 4 July; and 9 1521 mated with c? 1522 on 26, 27, and 

 30 June, cocooned 2 July, then mated again 23 July. This repetition 

 of copulation after oviposit ion is most unusual, for generally in spiders 

 the males die by the time the first cocoons are made. Equally unusual 

 is the fact that heavily pregnant females will receive males as late as 

 four and even two days before oviposition, whereas it is the rule that 

 pregnant females are extremely aggressive towards males (except in 

 Theridium). But we shall see a case in Geotrecha pinnata of copulation 

 during cocooning. Another unusual incident, though I have described 

 elsewhere similar occurrences in some other species, was that c? 1504 

 copulated with 9 1505 and she moulted a few hours afterwards. Early 

 in June males are quite as numerous as the females, and pairs are 

 frequently obtained in the same nest beneath a stone, but males 

 decrease in number during the summer, though I captured two as late 

 as 22 August. The first cT caught, No. 1500 on 13 June, was kept 

 continuously in a cage with 9 1501, and copulated with her six times 

 (the last time on 21 July), until 12 September; then I killed her, but 

 kept him, and he lived until the end of October. This longevity of a 

 male after the breeding season is without parallel in my experience. 

 In one case a male (1504) after copulating with a slightly smaller 

 female (1505) on 17 June, ate her on 25 June. This is a rare happening 

 among spiders, though McCook (/. c, Vol. II, p. 24) cites similar 

 instances in Epeirids and Agalenids. This male was, however, killed 

 and eaten by another female (1544) on 11 July, so was c? 1524 by a 

 gravid 9 1525, and c? 1502 by 9 1503 (after living together for nearly 

 a month). Five other males that were kept with females, and all of 

 which mated with them one or more times, died without being eaten 

 and with little or no evidence of injury; they seemed to have become 

 physically weakened, and one that I gently removed from his mate 

 to use for another experiment expired a few minutes after the removal. 

 Accordingly, in this species, where the males are about as large and 

 strong as the females, it is by no means the rule that the males end by 

 being eaten. The matings observed in captivity took place in almost 

 every instance outside of nests. 



Drassus neglectus (Keys). 



With regard to this species, common under stones in open fields 




560 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec., 



Emerton (I. c.) states (under the name of D. saccatus) : " In the early 

 summer a male and female live together in the nest, the female often 

 being immature." During % June I found several such pairs, as well 

 as males in separate nests, but after that month found no more 

 males. The copulation was observed in two cases. The first instance 

 concerns cT 1510 (an unusually large individual) and 9 1511, found in 

 different nests on 7 June and placed in one cage; he was larger than 

 she. The same day copulation was observed from 5.31-5.38 P.M., 

 one palpus applied at a time, the right three times and the left once, 

 each palpus being held in the epigynum for 1-2 minutes, then with- 

 drawn for about a minute, then the same or the other palpus inserted. 

 He left her at 5.42, but returned two minutes later and inserted the 

 left palpus for 15 seconds, then he left her again and she moved away 

 five minutes later. The position of the two was about the same as 

 in Phidippus. This pair were observed again in mating attitude at 

 3.30 P.M., 24 June, 8.10-8.17 P.M., 25 June, and 9.P.M., 29 June; 

 he died (not eaten by his mate) on 4 July. The other instance was that 

 of d 1 1506 and 9 1507 caught in the one nest on 16 June and placed 

 together in a cage. On 23 June, at 9 A.M., I found him copulating 

 with his right palpus; she had moulted within the preceding half hour, 

 was still soft and near her old exuvia. He kept his right palpus inserted 

 for 39 minutes, and when he withdrew it she struggled away from him. 

 But he found her again, at 9.42 inserted the same palpus for a few 

 seconds, again at 9.46 for a minute, and again continuously from 9.48 

 to 10.25, when I was obliged to leave, and on my return at 11.12 they 

 were separated. Both escaped from the cage before the end of the 

 month. 



This instance of mating with a female just at the time of her moulting 

 is interesting, for it gives the timorous male his opportunity while she 

 is helpless. It is probably full-grown males that seek out still immature 

 females and live with them in the same mating nest. 



Geotrecha crocata (Keys). 



The mating was observed only once, in the case of a female caught 

 3 August, and a male ten days previously, placed together in a small 

 cage on 4 August. In copulation the male stands over the female, 

 his ventral surface opposed to her dorsal, their body axes obliquely 

 inclined, his head a little to one side of the anterior end of her abdomen. 

 One palpus is inserted at a time. On 4 August they were observed 

 in copulation at 7.58 P.M. (three minutes previously they were sepa- 

 rate), and he kept his left palpus inserted for two minutes, the left 

 for nearly two minutes again, the same for one minute, then the right 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 561 



for a few seconds, when she suddenly rose and he jumped away. She 

 moved slightly after each palpal withdrawal, and he quieted her by 

 rapid tapping with his fourth leg pair. On 7 August he died from her 

 bite. 



Geotrecha pinnata Emerton. 



One male and three females were found running in an oak wood on 

 31 July and placed in a large cage. Two copulations were observed 

 on that day and on the next respect ivefy, the attitude being the same 

 as in G. crocata. In the first case the male inserted his palpi each twice 

 and successively from 5.42-5.43 P.M., then he turned away from the 

 female, returned and inserted the right palpus for a few seconds, 

 turned away, returned and inserted each palpus once, moved off, 

 returned and inserted both once, then moved away from her again ; 

 but when he sought her again at 5.51 she had gone off. What is 

 remarkable in this species is that the male, after one or two short palpal 

 insertions, departs an inch or more from the female, stands still for a 

 minute or more shaking his palpi, then turns and seeks her again 

 (wholly by touch unaided by sight), the female generally waiting 

 motionless for his return. He alwa} r s mounts over her head. The 

 next day the same male copulated in a similar fashion, from 11.35- 

 11.44 A.M., with eight palpal insertions. 



On 22 July five other individuals of this species were caught and 

 placed in one large cage. Two were males, one of them lacked one 

 palpus, and for convenience may be called A, while the other perfect 

 individual we ma} T call B; these males were combative on meeting 

 each other, but not aggressive to the females nor these to one another. 

 d 1 B at 5.20 P.M. met and copulated with a gravid female, inserting 

 his palpi about four times; then cT A touched her, she at first repulsed 

 him but half minute later accepted two palpal insertions from him; 

 at 5.36 both males were an inch away from her. Between 5.37 and 

 5.50 she received both males in the following order: C? A, c? A, cT B, 

 c? A, c? B, cT B, cT B, d 1 A, o 1 A. Then she rose and moved away, 

 returned to the same place, and repulsed further advances. After 

 cleansing herself she began at 7.20 P.M. to spin her cocoon. Between 

 8 and 9 P.M. she was interrupted by o 1 A five times, but drove him 

 off each time. At[9.06 cJ 1 B found her and copulated, and between then 

 and 9.15 copulated eight times. Between 9.22 and 9.35 cT A made 

 five advances, but was driven away each time. cT B copulated twice 

 at 9.42, and at 9.44 she repulsed d 1 A. I then kept both males away 

 from her in order to see the cocooning. This is a very remarkable 

 case of a female accepting copulation from two males alternately; 




562 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



and of interruption of the cocooning process by such mating. Only 

 an hour and a quarter after the last copulation she oviposited. During 

 the cocooning she was aggressive, raising her fore-legs, but c? B pressed 

 them down by rapid tapping and mounted over her head; the mating 

 was forced upon her against her maternal instinct. 



Prosthesima atra (Hentz). 



One male and four females were caught 7 August and placed in a 

 large dish, all unable to walk on the vertical glass side. On 9 August 

 the male was seen in mating attitute, but without palpal insertion, for 

 a quarter of an hour; this was at 5.20 P.M., and at 6.55 he was again 

 motionless upon a female, but without insertion of the palpi. Could it 

 have been that he was waiting for her to moult? On 15 August a 

 copulation was observed, the attitude as in Geotrecha; the pair was 

 first seen at 8.40 P.M. (they were not in copula a quarter of an hour 

 before), and during the succeeding 19 minutes he inserted his left 

 palpus 4 times and his right 3 times, each insertion lasting from 1 to 2 

 minutes. Another copulation was seen on 20 August at noon. 



Misumena aleatoria (Hentz). 



The male of this Thomisid is many times smaller than the female. 

 A pair were placed together in a cage on 27 August. In the copulation 

 both palpi are inserted simultaneously, and the male is placed upon 

 the ventral surface of the abdomen of the female with his head pointed 

 in the same direction as hers; the ventral surfaces of the two are 

 apposed. The male, after discharge of the sperm, may remain upon 

 the female's venter or may climb to her dorsum. He continues to 

 hold to the female for astonishingly long periods, for he is so small and 

 nimble that she is unable to displace him. Thus at one time he 

 remained upon her for 22 hours, even though I disturbed them by 

 removal to a bottle, and I found it difficult to push him off with a 

 pin ; at another time he remained continuously upon her from 4.57 P.M., 

 30 August, until 7.30 A. M., 1 September, when he left her, but regained 

 her at 9 A.M. and remained upon her until the following morning, when 

 she was found dead. Even her walking around the cage did not seem 

 to disturb him. Palpal insertions occupied only a small part of these 

 periods. 



Xysticus nervosus Banks. 



Two adult males and an immature female were placed in one cage 

 on 5 September. She repulsed their advances, and after moulting 

 on 11 September, was placed again with the males. One male found 

 and embraced her, then the other drove him off, or the first left the 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 563 



female to fight the other male, and this fighting of the two males upon 

 and around her body continued for half an hour, when I separated 

 them. The next day the same fight was renewed over her motionless 

 body for 50 minutes, when the female rose and walked away, the 

 males, thereafter, avoiding her. The copulatory attitude Is like that 

 of X. stomachosus, previously described by me (1903). The males 

 appeared as eager to fight as to mate. 



Caratinopsis interpres Em. 



Two males and a female of this small theridiid were placed in a vial 

 on 12 July. The males were savage on meeting and grappled with 

 each other. Within a few minutes the three had spun a maze of lines. 

 Twice it happened that both males simultaneously seized and tried 

 to embrace the female, and once one male copulated while the other 

 endeavored to do so; in each case the female shook both off at the 

 end of a minute or two. Finally one male inserted both palpi con- 

 tinuously for 21 minutes; their heads were in the same direction and 

 ventral surfaces apposed, the male held her with his first two pairs of 

 legs and had his head a little posterior to her epigynum. 



7. Nesting and Cocooning. 



The architectural habits of Ariadna and Pisaurina have been 

 described above. 



Phidippus purpuratus K. 



We have mentioned that during June a male and female are fre- 

 quently found together in one nest, and such mating nests are well 

 known for the Attids; these are perhaps the same as the nests which 

 the females occupy during the Winter. But on bringing home such 

 pairs and placing them in cages no such mating nests were made, but 

 the male and the female each built a thin-walled nest with two aper- 

 tures, during which they remain mostly only at night; the two would 

 also use the nests interchangeably, and would usually copulate outside 

 of them. Before cocooning each of my captive females spun in 

 an angle of the cage a much larger, entirely closed nest, so thick-walled 

 that she can scarcely be seen through it, and within this spun all the 

 cocoons of one season. Whether under natural conditions, on the 

 lower side of a stone, the female would employ her mating-nest as a 

 cocoon-nest, or whether the two are separate structures, I have not 

 ascertained. The male may enter the cocoon-nest after the female 

 has made an opening to it, to copulate with her, but he never remains 

 long therein, but usually spins a smaller nest of his own on its outer

surface. The special cases observed of cocoon-nest construction, 

 and of cocooning, were the following. $ 1519 made a thin nest on 

 28 June, and during the night made it very thick-walled with a narrow 

 aperture at one end. On the following day she was found at 12.30 P.M. 

 spinning vigorously across a vertical circular area, of greater diameter 

 than her own length, of the inner surface of the nest ; this was a distinct 

 cocoon-base made upon the wall of the nest. She ceased suddenly 

 at 1.10, rested quietly until I left at 1.30, and on my return at 2.50 

 was again spinning on the circular base, and worked through the 

 afternoon. At 8.10 P.M. she oviposited upon the base, holding her 

 head down and her feet on the margin of the base. She remained 

 quiet until 8.32, when she began to spin the cover for the eggs, swinging 

 the spinnerets from side to side and revolving her position from time 

 to time; this cover-spinning continued to the next day after 7 A.M. 

 On the 30 June she left the nest for the first time, from 8 July on left" 

 the nest daily to hunt for food and made a second aperture for egress. 

 The young began to leave the nest on 15 August, and at that time I 

 found a second cocoon containing eggs within the nest (the young of 

 which hatched 12 September). 9 1521 laid a mass of eggs within a 

 thin-walled nest on 2 July, but she ate them. On the 26 and 27 July 

 she worked continuously spinning a perfectly closed cocoon-nest in 

 an upper corner of the cage, then from 3 P.M. on for three hours spun 

 a cocoon-base within it, this base spun in an oblique position and its 

 diameter somewhat less than her own body length. She oviposited 

 about 9 P.M. (during my absence). Next morning at 8.00 she was 

 spinning a cover, but it was still very thin; consequently there must 

 have been a long pause between the oviposition and cover-spinning. 

 She did not leave the nest until fourteen days later; and when I opened 

 the nest on 12 September it contained hatched young. 9 1525 was 

 found on 17 July spinning a cocoon-base within an entirely closed, 

 thick nest from 3-5 P.M. ; this base was vertically inclined, extending 

 from the floor to the roof of the nest, not against its side. She rested 

 quietly for an hour and a quarter, spun again on the base for ten 

 minutes, then occupied eleven minutes in oviposition. Then she 

 seemed exhausted, and not until 10.34 began the cover-making, which 

 was completed next morning. She did not leave the nest until seven 

 days later. On 26 August she had again closed the nest, probably to 

 make another cocoon. On opening the nest 12 September I found that 

 only two eggs of the first cocoon had hatched, and none of the second. 

 These cases are given somewhat in detail, for they illustrate a con- 

 siderable range of individual difference. The cocoon-nests are viscid 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 565 



and very thick-walled, excellent homes for the young; the mother 

 closes them tightly before making each cocoon, and generally does 

 not emerge for food until a lapse of several days or even a fortnight; 

 she always returns to them after her hunts, and remains there with the 

 young until they leave. It is quite probable the young of the second 

 cocoon, when it is made late in the summer, may overwinter in the nest. 



Emerton says of this species (under the name of mystaceus) : u 

 " The largest of the New England Attidre . . . . It lives under stones 

 at all seasons. In winter or when moulting or laying eggs it hides in a 

 thick white bag of silk, in which the cocoons are made early in the 

 summer. The young become nearly full grown before winter." 

 Drassus neglectus (Keys). 



These spiders, as Emerton has noted, are to be found in pairs in 

 silken bags, and the following observations would show that such 

 mating-nests are probably always spun by the males. A pair (cT 1506, 

 9 1507) were taken from a nest on 16 June and placed in a cage. 

 During that afternoon and evening he spun a thin, closed nest around 

 them both, next day copulated within it, and both remained in the 

 nest until their escape twelve days later. Another pair, c? 1510, 

 9 1511, from separate nests were put into one cage, and the male 

 alone did the spinning of the nest. Another pair, cT 1527, 9 1528, 

 were taken from one nest and placed in a cage; he built a beautiful 

 and spacious saccular nest, entirely closed, in which he charged his 

 palps with sperm and she moulted ; she ate him in it three days later. 

 Still a fourth male, of another pair (cT 1529, 9 1530) from one nest, spun 

 a mating nest. In only one case have I seen the cocooning, though 

 several individuals were kept under observation. 9 1530 was on 

 24 July within a cylindrical closed nest, which was her enlargement 

 of the mating nest constructed by d 1 1529; in this species, then, the 

 mating-nest may become the cocoon-nest. At 7.30 A.M. I found she 

 was spinning within the nest upon a cocoon-base, that was a horizon- 

 tally placed, slightly concave saucer of silk fastened by two opposed 

 edges to the sides of the nest ; the beginning of this base was not seen, 

 but it must be either a modified partition of the nest or else a separate 

 structure, and in either case not a part of the wall of the nest. I was 

 unfortunately obliged to leave before the egg-laying, and on returning 

 at noon found the cocoon was completed. The cocoon is always 

 large, snow white, of a flattened biconvex shape, its circumference 

 polygonal; the mother holds it tenaciously with her feet until the

566 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



young emerge, though she may carry it about within the nest. In 

 no case have I seen the mothers with cocoons taking food before the 

 young hatch; the nest is kept closed through this period, and the 

 spiders pay little attention to insects moving on its outer surface. 

 Geotrecha. 



G. crocota and G. pinnata were not observed to make any nests in 

 confinement, while G. bivittata constructs a very thin, small saccular 

 nest. The conclusion of the cocooning was described by me (1903) 

 for G. (Thargalia) bivittata, and this summer I have seen the act 

 several times in the case of G. pinnata, and as follows: The cocoons 

 are discoidal, excessively flattened and scale-like, their free surface 

 (cover) very tough in consistency and difficult to tear open; under 

 natural conditions they are spun against a stone, while all of the six 

 cocoons made in my glass cages were placed at the junction of the 

 floor and the side ; thus they were circular discs bent in the middle at 

 a right angle. $ 1566 on 22 July began spinning a cocoon-base at 

 7.20 P.M. She spun slowly, sweeping the spinnerets from side to side, 

 over an area of about one and a half times her body length, at the 

 junction of the wall and the floor, so that half the base was horizontal 

 and half vertical. Half an hour later her labor had accomplished a 

 ring of pearly silk, most beautiful to behold, slightly elevated and with 

 almost no silk in the enclosed space. At 8.35 she began spinning 

 rapidly on this central space, then from 8.55-9.45 she was repeatedly 

 interrupted by the males A and B (as previously described) At 

 10.45 she ceased to sweep her spinnerets across the base, and instead 

 raised and lowered them in applying silk near the middle of the disc, 

 at the same time swaying her body backward and forward, thus pro- 

 ducing a central cushion of softer texture. After each spinneret 

 application the abdominal apex was elevated to a height equal to 

 about two-thirds the length of her cephalothorax, then the spinnerets 

 again applied. She ceased this abruptly at 10.57, stood over the 

 centre of the base, discharged from her genital aperture a clear globule 

 of viscid fluid upon it, and in this discharged in succession 8 large 

 yellow eggs, this whole oviposition occupying two and a half minutes. 

 But she attempted in vain to liberate herself from the viscid drop, 

 and began to eat the eggs; this miscarriage may have been due to the 

 late copulation. In the case of another individual ( 9 1572) the work 

 on the cocoon base lasted from 9.45-10.57 P.M., the oviposition for a 

 minute and a half, and the cover-spinning from 11.00 P.M. to after 

 12.45 A.M., when I left for weariness. The first ten minutes of the 

 cover-making were occupied in carrying thread from the edge of the 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 567 



base on to and across the egg mass, with swinging of the abdomen from 

 side to side; the remainder of the time in brushing the spinnerets to 

 and fro without raising them, which resulted in the dense structure of 

 the outer surface of the cover. Next morning the cocoon was partly 

 covered with small debris (bits of earth and wood, fragments of in- 

 sects), and rendered much less conspicuous. The free surface of the 

 cocoon is always furnished in this manner; it is never enclosed in a nest, 

 and the mother does not remain by it. The cocoon is not only par- 

 tiall} r hidden in this way, but it is so closely adherent, so flattened and 

 so tough, that the eggs are most excellently protected, and this explains 

 why so few eggs are laid. Two cocoons were found with 8 eggs each, 

 and three with 9. The method of applying the foreign objects to the 

 cocoon was seen clearly in the case of two cocoons made by other 

 females during the night of 26 July, some time between 10.30 P.M. 

 and 7.30 A.M. These cocoons were placed only an inch apart, the 

 mothers did not seem to distinguish their own from the other's, and 

 proceeded to furnish either impartially. Each mother hunted around 

 the cage by touch, for small objects, carried them in the chelicera to a 

 cocoon, also found by touch (though there appeared to be some memory 

 of its situation), then dropped them upon a cocoon. Then the mothers 

 chewed these objects into smaller particles, and agglutinated them to 

 the cocoon evidently by some salivary secretion, and to this secretion 

 is also probably due the change in color of the cocoon surface from a 

 beautiful opaline, or pearly, lustre to a dull brown. 



So far as I know this is the first instance described of the application 

 of some salivary secretion to the cocoon surface; very likely the bluish 

 or greenish colors of the outer layer of Lycosid cocoons are also due to 

 a similar secretion from the mouth, for the silk employed is white, 

 and the cocoon does not change its white color until the mother holds 

 it beneath her and carefully applies her mouth parts to all of its surface. 

 This secretion may have the value of a varnish, a finish smoothing 

 over all irregularities. 



Phrurolithus alarius (Hentz). 



As Emerton (1889) notes, this drassid "lives on and under stones 

 in dry, open ground and runs with great swiftness short distances at 

 a time/' The spiders are much less frequently seen than their cocoons. 

 The latter are tightly fastened to stones, scarlet in color, probably 

 due to a salivary secretion, much flattened and scale-like, of greater 

 diameter than the spider's length, and are sometimes covered with 

 foreign matter. They are not guarded by the mother, and it was only 




568 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



by keeping these spiders in cages that the makers of these cocoons 

 were determined. One cocoon that I opened contained only 13 eggs. 



Prosthesima atra (Hentz). 



These common drassids live beneath stones in small, thin-walled 

 nests. A remarkable habit was seen on several occasions during the 

 nest-making in cages : the spider spins first upon the floor of the cage 

 beneath her, then at intervals stands nearly vertical with the head down 

 rotating the elevated abdomen on its pedicel, or else bending it quickly 

 from side to side ; the abdominal apex then describes circles in the air 

 with the spinnerets actively moving. This is done for a few seconds 

 at a time, and alternated irregularly with spinning on the floor. Such 

 an attitude has not been seen by me before. Is it an attempt to find 

 some roofing object against which to spin, or is it a throwing or casting 

 of a line? Emerton (/. c.) has observed that the "cocoon is fiat on 

 one side, by which it is attached, and convex on the other. It is 

 white, or sometimes a little pink." The cocoon is sometimes, but not 

 always, thinly covered with foreign particles, and is guarded by the 

 mother, who rests upon it ; but she does not hold it nearly so tenaciousl} r 

 as Drassus does. Wild cocoons are found first in the early part of 

 August, and sometimes two are found superimposed. 



Poecilochroa. 



A female of P. variegata (Hentz) was placed in a vial, where she 

 made an incomplete nest at one end. On 27 July at 7.30 A.M. she was 

 standing in a small cell within this nest upon a nearly completed 

 cocoon-base ; this base was thin, roughly circular in outline, its diameter 

 about one and a half times her body length, and placed almost vertical, 

 with its margins fastened to the inner wall of the nest. She oviposited 

 upon the centre of this base from 8.02 to 8.04, then spun until 9.15 

 constructing the cover. Until 1 September, when the young emerged, 

 the cocoon remained in the same position, attached by its edges to 

 the nest, with the mother holding it continuously. A female of 

 P. bilineata (Hentz) was caught on 11 July, and on the night of 13 July 

 made a cocoon : a flattened circular disc, placed horizontally, its diameter 

 greater than her length with outstretched legs, its color glistening 

 ivory-white with a pearly lustre. She subsequently made a closed 

 nest around it, did not change its position, but remained upon it; she 

 left the nest for the first time four weeks later, but returned to it ; the 

 young hatched 17 August. A wild cocoon of this species contained 

 22 eggs. 

 Range of Architecture in Drassids. — The observations just described 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 569 



show an interesting series: Pcecilochroa, which leaves the cocoon 

 attached to the nest and holds it until hatching; Drassus, which cuts 

 loose the cocoon from the nest wall, but which also holds the cocoon 

 continuously until hatching; Prosthesima, which makes a much thinner 

 nest and holds the cocoon within it, but not tenaciously, and occa- 

 sionally places foreign objects on its surface; and Geotrecha, which 

 makes only a very slight nest (bivittata) or no nest at all (pinnata), and 

 which does not guard the cocoon, but regularly garnishes it with foreign 

 matter. The last condition is probably the most modified, for it 

 represents the loss of the maternal instinct. At the end of this series 

 the number of eggs is least.

570 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



The following Reports were ordered to be printed : 



REPORT OF THE RECORDING SECRETARY. 



It is gratifying to be able to report that, notwithstanding the impor- 

 tant and, it might be supposed, disturbing building operations of the 

 past year, the routine work of the Academy has been but little inter- 

 fered with. The October meetings, indeed, had to be omitted, because, 

 while the old Library Hall was dismantled, the new Reading Room 

 was not quite ready. The meetings of the Academy will hereafter 

 be held here, except on occasions of extraordinary and therefore large 

 attendance, when the Lecture Hall on the floor below will be avail- 

 able. Fourteen meetings were, therefore, held during the Academic 

 year, at which the average attendance was forty-four. Verbal com- 

 munications, for the most part illustrated, were made by Messrs. 

 F. Creighton Wellman, John W. Harshberger, F. Lynwood Garrison, 

 Philip P. Calvert, Thomas H. Montgomery, Jr., J. M. MacFarlane, 

 Henry Skinner, Frank F. Keeley, Arthur Erwin Brown, Edwin G. 

 Conklin, Henry A. Pilsbry, Stewardson Brown, Gilbert Van Ingen, 

 Edwin T. Wherry, Benjamin Smith Lyman, and the Secretary. 



Thirty-six papers have been received for publication from the 

 following authors: Henry A. Pilsbry, 4; H. A. Pilsbry and James H. 

 Ferriss, 2; H. A. Pilsbry and E, G. Vanatta, 1; H. A. Pilsbry and 

 C. Montague Clark, 1 ; H. A. Pilsbry and Y. Hirase, 1 ; H. A. Pilsbry 

 and A. A. Hinkley, 1 ; R. V. Chamberlin, 3; Thos. H. Montgomery, Jr., 

 2; Stewardson Brown, 2; J. P. Moore, 2; John W. Harshberger, 2; 

 James A. G. Rehn and Morgan Hebard, 2; F. Creighton Wellman, 1 ; 

 Charles S. Boyer, 1 ; G. E. Crampton, 1 ; Nathan Banks, 1 ; F. J. Keeley, 

 1; F. W. Weymouth, 1; Robert T. Young, 1; A. E. Verrill and A. H. 

 Verrill, 1; Burnett Smith, 1; Clarence B. Moore, 1; Ales Hrdlicka, 1; 

 Thomas Barbour, 1; Henry W. Fowler, 1. Twenty-nine of these 

 have appeared as portions of the sixty-first volume of the Proceedings ; 

 four have been returned to the authors, and action has been deferred 

 on one. The two papers by Messrs. Moore and Hrdlicka form the 

 first part of the fourteenth volume of the quarto Journal. The 

 number is beautifully illustrated by text figures and eight plates of 

 Indian pottery. The latter are superb specimens of color printing 

 and present as faithful a representation of the objects, themselves of 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 571 



quite unexpected beauty, as art can at present secure. The Academy 

 is indebted for this continuation of the Journal to the liberality and 

 devotion to his chosen branch of science of Mr. Clarence B. Moore. 



As evidence that the building operations and movings have not 

 curtailed the work of the Publication Committee, it may be noted 

 that the issue of the various serials now sent out under the auspices 

 of the Academy is 129 pages in excess of that of last year, which itself 

 was unusually productive. The number of illustrative plates, however,. 

 is 38 less than reported in 1908. The record is as follows : Proceed- 

 ings, 636 pages and 27 plates; Journal, 252 pages and 8 plates; 

 Entomological News, 444 pages and 22 plates; Transactions of 

 the American Entomological Society (The Entomological Section 

 of the Academy), 486 pages and 12 plates; Manual of Conchology t 

 250 pages and 26 plates, making a total of 2,068 pages and 95 plates. 



The index to the publications of the Academy has been completed 

 up to and including the volume of the Proceedings for 1905. 



The short history of the Academy prepared as a contribution to 

 the Founders' Week Memorial Volume and read at the meeting of the 

 Academy held April 6 has been published. It will be issued in a 

 separate edition and distributed to members, correspondents and others 

 interested, in the hope that it may elicit comment, criticism and per- 

 haps correction, which will render of more permanent value the detailed 

 history in course of preparation for the Centenary of the Academy 

 in 1912. 



The accumulated stock of the Proceedings, Journal and mis- 

 cellaneous publications, held for sale and exchange, has been removed 

 from the upper story of the middle building to cases prepared for 

 storage in the basement. This is the fourth time this material has 

 been moved to provide for the requirements of other interests since 

 the occupancy of the corner building in 1876. It has been well said 

 that three movings are as bad as a fire, and it is earnestly to be hoped 

 that the present resting place will be permanent until the parts are 

 distributed in fulfilment of their legitimate purpose as contributions 

 to science. Incidentally an account of stock has been taken. 



Ten members and five correspondents have been elected. The 

 deaths of fourteen members and six correspondents have been 

 announced. Messrs. J. H. Austin and Henry Pemberton have resigned. 

 The loss sustained by the Academy in the death of Henry Cadwalader 

 Chapman, so intimately concerned for many years with the scientific 

 and administrative interests of the society, requires more than passing 

 mention, and the Recording Secretary has been charged with the 




572 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



preparation of a biographical notice which, it is hoped, will be ready 

 for presentation early the coming year. 



The birth of Charles Darwin and the publication of the Origin of 

 Species were fittingly commemorated by a well attended meeting on 

 February 16, at which addresses were made by the President, Dr. 

 Arthur Erwin Brown, and Dr. Edwin G. Conklin. 



A successful meeting of the American Museums Association was 

 held in the Academy, May 13. 



Edward J. Nolan, 



Recording Secretary. 



REPORT OF THE CORRESPONDING SECRETARY. 



During the year six correspondents of the Academy died and five 

 were elected. Those deceased are Prof. Jean Albert Gaudry, Prof. 

 Perceval de Loriol Le Fort, Prof. Rudolph Bergh, Dr. Robert E. C. 

 Stearns, Dr. Anton Dohrn and Prof. Kakichi Mitsukuri; and those 

 elected, Dr. John Mason Clarke, Dr. Robert F. Scharff, Dr. Albert 

 Leon Charles Calmette, Dr. Sven A. Hedin and Prof. Oscar Drude. 



In accordance with the award of last year the Hayden Gold Medal 

 was, on December 11, transmitted to Dr. John Mason Clarke, and an 

 acknowledgment of the same duly received, together with an official 

 copy of a minute appreciative of the Academy's action passed by 

 Dr. Clarke's associates on the Board of Regents of the University of 

 the State of New York. 



Among the events of importance to the scientific world in which 

 the Academy was invited to participate were the following: The 

 presentation of an international testimonial in honor of Amedeo 

 Avogadro, the student of the molecular constitution of gases; the 

 Fiftieth Anniversary of the founding of the Botanical Institute of 

 Brandenburg; the Three hundred and fiftieth Anniversary of the 

 foundation of the University of Geneva; the Darwin Centenary exer- 

 cises of the New York Academy of Sciences ; the International Congress 

 of Mining, Metallurgy and Practical Geology; the Seventeenth Inter- 

 national Congress of Americanists; the dedication exercises of the 

 Lamarck Centenary memorial statue in Paris; the Jubilee of the 

 Geological Society of Glasgow, and the presentation by President 

 Taft of medals in recognition of their services to aeronautics to Wilbur 

 and Orville Wright. As delegates representing the Academy at the 

 Glasgow jubilee and the University of Geneva celebration, Sir Archi- 

 bald Geikie and Dr. Auguste Forel, both correspondents, were respec- 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 573 



tively appointed. While no delegates were appointed to represent 

 the Academy on the other occasions, suitable letters of congratulation 

 or expressions of interest were in each case forwarded. 



As a mark of appreciation of our contribution toward defraying 

 the expenses of its project, the Lamarck Memorial Committee in Paris 

 presented the Academy with the interesting bust of the great French 

 evolutionist that now adorns the Reading Room. 



Numerous letters and notices were answered or referred to the 

 proper officers of the Academy, as their nature required. 



Following is a tabulated statement of the statistics of the cor- 

 respondence for the year :

Fifteen hundred and seventy-eight volumes have been bound since 

 the last report. 



Among the new books acquired during the year that are worthy of 

 special mention are the following: 



J. D. Hooker's Botany of the Antarctic Voyage of H. M. Discovery 

 Ships Erebus and Terror, in seven quarto volumes. 



A complete set of thirty- two volumes of the periodical Kosmos, 

 published in Lemberg. 



Kops and Van Eeden's Flora Batava, a complete set to date of 

 twenty-three quarto volumes. 



Ungarische Revue from 1885 to 1895, received from the Hungarian 

 Academy of Sciences in response to an application for deficiencies. 



Journal of the Anthropological Society of Bombay, Volumes 1 to 7. 



The publications of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition. 



Transactions of the Leicester Literary and Philosophical Society 

 from 1835 to 1895. 



Volumes 1 to 13, inclusive, of Forest and Stream, completing our set 

 of that periodical. 



A set of the J ahresbericht ilber die Fortschritte der physischen Wissen- 

 schaften (der Chemie und Physiologie) , in thirty volumes. 



The following new journals have been added to the list: 



Archiv filr die Geschichte der Naturioissenschaften und Technik, 

 Leipzig. 



Zcitschrift fiir induktive Abstammungs- und Vererbungslehre, Berlin. 



Zeitschrift fiir Botanik, Jena. 



Dorfleria, Vienna. 



Mannus, Wurzburg. 



Natur, Leipzig. 



Proshistorische Zeitschrift, Berlin. 



The current year is probably the most important in the history of 




576 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec. 



the Library, marked, as it has been, by a radical change in the manner 

 of shelving and preserving the books. 



The rear portion of the building, completed during the summer, will 

 ultimately contain seven tiers of steel stacks for the accommodation 

 of the Library. The five of these now in place provide more than 

 twice the former shelfing, upon which approximately 120,000 volumes 

 can be placed, so that at the present rate of growth it is not likely 

 that the two additional stacks will be required during the lifetime of 

 any but the youngest members of the Academy. 



The first armful of books, a collection of Academy lists, catalogues, 

 biographies, histories and the five bound volumes of Leidyana, was 

 carried to the new building at 4.30 P.M., August 25. The following- 

 day the cases in the Reading Room were filled. After an unavoidable 

 interruption work was resumed on the 30th, and, with the help of a 

 corps of six reliable and intelligent men, by September 22d the books 

 were all in place, three weeks having been devoted to the work. The 

 position of the several sections of the library had been determined on 

 before the moving began, and they were placed at once where they 

 are to remain, care being taken to leave space for growth. More 

 time was, of course, thus consumed than if the books had been carried 

 over and piled up to await a later arrangement; but the gain in the 

 end was of importance, as the work was complete as far as it went. 

 The books were always accessible, and, as a matter of fact, the use < >f 

 the Library was not interfered with for a single hour. 



The cases have been numbered, and the several sections are indicated 

 by neatly lettered signs at the ends of the stacks. A printed guide 

 to the arrangement will further assist those consulting the collection. 

 It has not, so far, been necessary to make any special legislation 

 regarding admission to the stacks. Those working in the Academy 

 seem to have no difficulty in finding what they want, and books desired 

 by casual readers are promptly supplied by the attendants. The 

 catalogues will be revised as soon as time can be secured for the work. 

 There has been but one departure from the old classification: the 

 special journals have been grouped under their subject headings; 

 transactions of general societies and other publications dealing with 

 more than one branch of science being arranged geographically, as before. 

 The new arrangement, although sacrificing in some minor particulars 

 the convenience so enthusiastically recognized by all who had access 

 to the old hall, is eminently satisfactory. Three well-lighted and 

 convenient apartments between the Reading Room and the stacks 

 have been assigned for the use of the Recording Secretary and Librarian 

 and his Assistant. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 577 



The spacious Reading Room has been surrounded by bookcases, 

 in which are placed the books most likely to be frequently called for — 

 a portion of those on general natural history, recent accessions, dic- 

 tionaries and bibliography. With the exception of the cases for the 

 temporary reception of new books, this is more a matter of furnishing 

 than of library convenience, as no difficulty is experienced in securing 

 any work desired from the stacks, which are sufficiently lighted by the 

 windows in ordinarily fine weather, the electric lights provided in 

 the aisles being required only on cloudy days and late in the afternoon. 



A room on the stairway leading to the Lecture Hall has been appro- 

 priated for the storage of duplicates and of journals not immediately 

 germane to the work of the Academy. 



The rooms vacated by the Library, to the east of the Race street 

 entrance, have, on the recommendation of the Council, been assigned 

 for the use of the State Department of Health during the term of 

 office of the present State Commissioner, the President of the Academy, 

 and are now so occupied. 



There has been no interruption of current work. Books have been 

 ordered, received and catalogued, exchanges have been made and 

 accessions displayed as usual on the library tables for the use of those 

 compiling bibliographies or desirous of keeping up their knowledge 

 of the progress of science. 



Acknowledgment is due the Assistant Librarian, William J. Fox, 

 for most intelligent and efficient service in the moving of the books 

 to the new building and of the stock of publications to the new storage 

 cases, as well as for the faithful discharge of his current duties in 

 connection with the Library and the Publication office. 



We are indebted to the Free Library of Philadelphia for the loan of 

 the trucks used in the transportation of the books to the new building. 



It is believed that the portion of the year's work with which the 



Library Committee and the Librarian are charged may be regarded 



as a subject of warm congratulation. 



Edward J. Nolan, 



Librarian. 



REPORT OF THE CURATORS. 



The additions and alterations to the Academy buildings, begun in 

 the spring of 1908 under an appropriation of $150,000 from the Com- 

 monwealth of Pennsylvania, have been completed. 



The entrance from Race street has been remodeled and now presents 




57S PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



a commanding hallway which leads directly to the main Museum 

 building, through the space formerly occupied by the old Lecture 

 Hall. 



The stairways in the main Museum building have been removed 

 to the Nineteenth street entrance, from which a new vestibule has 

 been constructed, shut off from the galleries of each floor by fire-walls 

 and automatic fire-doors. 



On the lot situated at Nineteenth and Cherry streets, 50 x 130 feet 

 in size, has been erected a handsome fireproof building, now occupied 

 by the Hall of the Academy, the Library stack and Reading Room. 



The third floor, with the top floor of the main Museum building, 

 have been divided into a number of study rooms and laboratories. 

 All are reached by an electric elevator. 



In the old Museum all the iron columns have been fireproofed and 

 fire escapes provided to comply with the legal requirememts. 



New vaults for the storage of the alcoholic collections have been 

 constructed and the collections transferred to them. 



The increased room and accommodations now provided have long 

 been needed for the protection and accommodation of the invaluable 

 Library and Museum of the Academy and the collections of the Com- 

 monwealth of Pennsylvania and the American Philosophical Society, 

 deposited in its keeping. 



At this year's session of the State Legislature an additional appro- 

 priation of $60,000 was made to the Academy, with which it is proposed 

 to encase the walls of the original greenstone building, which are 

 becoming badly weathered, with brick and terra cotta, and to add 

 such terra cotta facings to the middle wing as will make the entire 

 building uniform in appearance. 



The Museum, which had been closed to the public during the altera- 

 tions, was reopened early in the year, and much of the time of the 

 Museum staff has been devoted to the cleansing and rearrangement 

 of the specimens. 



A radical rearrangement has been effected on the mammal floor 

 and many of the osteological specimens temporarily removed from 

 exhibition. 



All the water birds were removed while the cases were being cleansed 

 and repainted and were then rearranged. 



The immense series of jars containing the alcoholic collections have 

 been thoroughly cleansed before being arranged in the new vaults. 



Notwithstanding this unusual amount of routine work, considerable 

 local field work was done by members of the Museum staff and several 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 579 



more extended trips were made. Largely through the liberality of 

 Mr. Morgan Hebard, Mr. Rehn was enabled to accompany him on a 

 trip through the Western States, and a large collection of Orthoptera 

 and some other specimens were secured. 



Through the Esther Hermann Research Fund of the New York 

 Academy of Sciences, Mr. Stewardson Brown was enabled to make 

 another botanical exploration of Bermuda during May in the interests 

 of the New York Botanic Garden and this Academy. Dr. J. P. Moore 

 spent the summer collecting marine invertebrates at Martha's Vineyard 

 and Woods Hole. Mr. Clarence B. Moore has continued his explorations 

 of the Indian mounds of the Southern States, and has added many 

 valuable specimens to the collection made by him since 1893. The 

 Moore collection now contains over 5,000 specimens, all systematically 

 arranged and labelled by Mr. Moore. 



Among the more important accessions of the year may be men- 

 tioned the Clemens collection of Philippine birds, the Hinkley collec- 

 tion of Mexican mollusca, a collection of Brazilian insects made by 

 Miss H. B. Merrill — all secured [by purchase — and the Commons Her- 

 barium, an unusually complete collection of the flora of Delaware, 

 made by Mr. Albert Commons, and presented to the Academy by his 

 nephews, Messrs. Frank W. and Howard W. Commons. 



One mahogany and plate glass exhibition case has been added to 

 the bird hall, and forty-three storage cases and 15S Schmidt insect 

 boxes have been purchased. 



In addition Dr. J. P. Moore has cared for the collection of annelids 

 and Mr. H. W. Fowler the fishes, while Miss H. N. Wardle has 

 arranged portions of the archaeological specimens. 



To Mr. Sam'l S. Van Pelt in the Herbarium and to Mr. E. T. Cresson , Jr. , 

 in the Entomological department the Curators are indebted for valuable 

 assistance. 



Specimens have been loaned during the year to A. S. Hitchcock, 

 C. J. Pennock, Dr. Ludwig Neumayer, J. H. Fleming, F. C. Baker, 

 Mary J. Rathbun, Robert Ridgway, Dr. Paul Bartsch, H. C. Oberholser, 

 Merritt Cary and W. W. Eggleston. 



Samuel G. Dixon, 



Curator. 



Report of the Department of Mollusca. 



Work during the past year has been chiefly directed to the prepa- 

 ration, determination and labelling of new material added to the col- 

 lections, and to the preparation of an illustrated monograph on the 




580 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC. r 



family Partulidce, which has been published in the Manual of Con- 

 ch ology. 



Very large accessions of the mollusca of Louisiana and southeastern 

 Arkansas we owe to Mr. Clarence B. Moore. Mr. Stewardson Brown 

 has further augmented the series from Bermuda, and the study of 

 Arizona snails collected by J. H. Ferriss and the Curator has nearly 

 reached completion; reports thereon are now in course of publication 

 by the Academy. 



The shells collected by Mr. A. A. Hinkley in Mexico have been 

 determined, and the new forms described in several papers. 



Mr. John B. Henderson, Jr., has contributed a series of Cuban shells 

 collected this year, and Dr. Arnold Ortmann gave a set of western 

 Pennsylvania freshwater mussels, especially valuable on account of 

 the rapid destruction of the faunas of these streams by mine water. 

 A large series of mollusks from Tonkin has been purchased, in order 

 to afford material for comparison with those of China, Korea and 

 Japan, which the Curator is working upon. 



Accessions hardly less valuable have been received from many 

 correspondents of the Department, as noted in the' Additions to the 

 Museum.

Special Curator, Dept. of Mollusca. 



REPORTS OF SECTIONS. 

 Biological and Microscopical Section. 



The Section has held nine regular meetings during the year, with an 

 average attendance of nine members. Ten informal meetings have 

 also been held. 



The Conservator reports the donation of six boxes of slides from the 

 estate of the late Dr. Henry C. Chapman. 



The work of the year consisted chiefly in the exhibition and descrip- 

 tion of mounted slides and material by each member present, and in 

 the exchange of specimens for mounting, among which may be 

 mentioned a valuable series of about seventy rare minerals in micro- 

 scopic crystals distributed by Mr. Keeley. 



Among the papers presented are the following: "Microscopical 

 Image Formation," by Mr. F. J. Keeley, published in the Proceedings; 

 "The Hookworm Disease," by Dr. T. S. Stewart. 



Mr. Palmer described a new form of Pinnularia which he has named 

 Pinnularia socialis, found in groups of four. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 581 



Mr. Van Sickel devised a new form of opaque mounting slide, and, 

 at the request of members, several thousand were manufactured 

 from his design for general use. 



Mr. Shulze discovered several new forms of Diatomacece in the Bar- 

 bacloes deposit, one of which has been named and described by Mr. 

 Boyer in the Proceedings. 



Mr. Schumo presented various specimens and gave a talk on Mosses, 

 illustrated with lantern slides. 



Communications were also made by Mr. Bilgram on Myxomycetes; 

 Dr. Owen, on salt solutions; Mr. Da vies, on various vegetable prepara- 

 tions; Mr. Van Sickel, on the crystallization of Platinum; Mr. Boyer, 

 on local diatoms, and by Messrs. Keeley, Rothermel, Ray and other 

 members, on miscellaneous subjects. 



An increased interest is apparent in the preparation of specimens 

 and in the manipulation of the microscope and much original work 

 has been accomplished during the year. 



The officers for the year 1910 are as follows: 



Director, 

 Vice-Director, 

 Recorder, 



Corresponding Seer eta ry, 

 Treasurer, . 

 Conservator, 



J. Cheston Morris, M.D.

 Thomas S. Stewart, M.D. 

 F. J. Keeley. 

 Charles S. Boyer, 



Recorder. 



Entomological Section. 



The usual meetings of this Section have been held with an average 

 attendance of nine persons. During the year upwards of 3,000 speci- 

 mens have been added to the collection. Eight new cases and 158 

 boxes have been purchased to accommodate the growth of the cabinet. 

 The orders Hemiptera and Neuroptera and the family Tenthredinidse 

 of the order Hymenoptera have been rearranged. Part of the American 

 Rhopalocera has been transferred to new cases. The publications of 

 the Section have been successfully continued. One member and 

 two associates have been elected. 



At a meeting held December 23 the following officers were elected:

Botanical Section. 



Early in the year the work of putting the species of flowering plants 

 into covers was completed, which will prove not only a convenience 

 in studying, but will also secure a decrease in the possible breakage of 

 specimens. 



The most notable addition during the year has been the Albert 

 Commons Herbarium of Delaware plants, representing his collecting 

 during half a century. It is probably the most complete series of the 

 flora of the State, including not only the flowering plants and ferns, 

 but also the lower forms, fungi, etc. The collections were presented 

 to the Academy by Messrs. Frank W. and Howard W. Commons, of 

 Minneapolis, Minn. 



Other donations include a collection of 50 species of Bucks County, 

 Pa., Crataegus from Dr. C. D. Fretz; 160 Crataegus and other trees 

 and shrubs from the Arnold Arboretum ; 250 specimens of plants from 

 the eastern United States from E. B. Bartram, and smaller collections, 

 aggregating about 150 specimens, which will be noted in detail in the 

 Additions to the Museum. 



The Section has purchased 500 specimens of California and Nevada 

 plants from A. A. Heller; 40 specimens of Crataegus from Willard W. 

 Eggleston and 100 Mexican mosses from C. G. Pringle. 



The Conservator spent the time from May 22 to June 2 of the present 

 year in the Bermudas, w T here a collection of about 250 plants was made, 

 and, though not large in species, enabled him to determine some 

 uncertain records, besides adding a number to the known flora of the 

 islands. The results of this and two previous trips are embodied in 

 a paper in the current number of the Proceedings. 



The Philadelphia Botanical Club has continued to hold its meetings 

 in the herbarium of the Academy during the year, and through the 

 energy of its members 2,100 sheets have been added to the local 

 collection, in the care of which Mr. Samuel S. Van Pelt has continued 

 his valuable services as Curator. 



Acknowledgment is made of the services of Miss Ada Allen as 

 assistant in the herbarium during the year. 




1909.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 583 



At the annual meeting of the Section the following were elected as 

 officers for the coming year: 



Director, Benjamin H. Smith. 



Vice-Director, Joseph Crawford. 



Secretary and Recorder, . . . Charles S. Williamson. 



Treasurer and Conservator, . . . Stewardson Brown. 



Respectfully submitted, 



Stewardson Brown, 



Conservator. 



The Mineralogical and Geological Section. 



The Section held seven meetings in 1909, with an average attend- 

 ance of six. Communications were made by Prof. O. C. S. Carter, 

 on earthquakes ; Dr. E. T. Wherry, on fossil plants at Holicong, Bucks 

 County, with a report on them by Dr. David White ; Mr. T. C. Palmer, 

 on minute beryls at Avondale, Delaware County; B. S. Lyman, on 

 the need of instrumental surveying in practical geology, and on advan- 

 tages of not exaggerating the vertical scale in geological cross-sections ; 

 Col. Joseph Willcox, on fossil elephants, Glyptodon, manatee and 

 horses in Florida ; Mr. F. J. Keeley, on asteriated sapphire from 

 Ceylon; Miss E. Walter, on sub-fossil Sequoia in San Francisco. 



The Section also met in conjunction with the Academy on the 

 evening of May 18th, and made through its members three communi- 

 cations to the meeting. 



There were six field excursions of the Section, with an average 

 attendance of about 29. On all the excursions, except the third, the 

 parties visited crystalline rocks and their minerals, namely: (1) 

 Between Woodlane and Ardmore, Montgomery County; (2) between 

 Elwyn and Newtown Square, Delaware County; (3) New Red rocks 

 and trapdikes, between Camp Hill and Three Tuns, Montgomery 

 County; (4) near Moylan, Strath Haven, Avondale and Cram Creek, 

 Delaware County; (5) near Cynwyd, Mill Creek and Bryn Mawr, 

 Montgomery County; (6) near Glen Mills, Lenni, Chester County, and 

 Blackhorse, Delaware County. 



Besides the meetings and excursions of the Section, there was, by 

 its invitation, a numerously attended meeting of geologists of the 

 northeastern part of the United States held at the Academy on the 

 afternoon and evening of April 23d, at which six highly valuable 

 communications were read, followed, the next day, by a very profitable 

 field excursion of 23 participants, under the guidance of Prof. Bascom, 




584 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



to typical places of pre-Cambrian and early Paleozoic rocks, from 

 Lafayette up the Schuylkill to Norristown, and thence to Henderson, 

 Gulf Mills and Bryn Mawr. 



The membership of the Section has increased during the year by 

 three associate members. The field excursions lead to joining it as 

 associate members; and sometimes immediately, or later through 

 interest in the meetings, to becoming members of the Academy. The 

 full membership is now 25 members and 15 associate members, 40 in 

 all. 



The following officers of the Section have been elected for the year 

 1910: 



Director, ..... Benjamin Smith Lyman. 



Vice-Director, ..... Frank J. Keeley. 



Recorder and Secretary, . . . Silas L. Schumo. 



Treasurer and Conservator, . . George Vaux, Jr. 



Respectfully submitted by order of the Section. 



Benjamin Smith Lyman, 



Director. 



Ornithological Section. 



Work in the Ornithological department has been seriously hampered 

 during the past year by the alterations to the top floor of the Museum. 

 which necessitated the disarrangement of most of the cases for nearly 

 six months, while the demands upon the Conservator's time in looking 

 after other departments of the Museum and the absence of Mr. Rehn 

 in the West also interfered with the work of the department. 



The cases have now, however, been permanently placed, all the 

 drawers examined and the specimens arranged, while the rooms have 

 been thoroughly cleaned. 



The remainder of the Tristram and Porter collections, comprising 

 several thousand skins, have been systematically distributed, and the 

 Van der Pol collection has been catalogued, while the Limnicolce or 

 shore birds have been critically studied, reidentified and arranged 

 in standard metal cases. 



It was found necessary to remove a large part of the exhibition 

 series from the cases, so as to permit of the cleansing of both specimens 

 and cases. A portion of this work has been accomplished, and one 

 new exhibition case secured. For the study collection of skins ten 

 additional metal and four large wooden cases were procured, which 

 enables us for the first time to place the entire study series in 




1909.] 



NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



585 



standard cases. A number of valuable additions to the collection 

 have been made during the year, the most important being the 

 Clemens specimens from Mindanao, Philippine Islands. 



The Delaware Valley Ornithological Club and the Pennsylvania 

 Audubon Society have held their meetings in the Ornithological 

 rooms during the year, and have done much to further the interests 

 of the department. To Mr. J. A. G. Rehn the Conservator is indebted 

 for valuable assistance in labelling and cataloguing.
