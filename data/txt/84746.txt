CRITICAL LIST OF MOLLUSKS COLLECTED IN THE POTOMAC VALLEY. 

 BY H. A. PILSBKY. 



The mollusks etiumeriited in thir? jmper were collected by Mr. 

 J. E. Ives and the writer during the course of a pedestrian tour 

 throui^li parts of Pennsylvania, ^laryland and West Virginia, in 

 September, 1892. The route walked over was as follows: From 

 Gettysburg, Pa., westward to the summit of South Mountain, thence 

 southwest to Maryland, across the Cumberland Valley to Hagers- 

 town, Md. From this point the Cumberland Pike (State road) was 

 followed, with occasional slight deviations, westward to Cumberland, 

 Md. From Cumberland, Mr. Ives proceeded to Luray, Va., 

 across the multitude ol ranges which traverse West Virginia. The 

 writer returning to Philadelphia, stopping to collect at Cherry Run, 

 on the Potomac River, in West Virginia. 



On such a trip one is constantly tempted to stop hy the wayside to 

 examine or collect ; and if he be possessed of that passion for collect- 

 ing " specimens " which is the fatal birthright of most naturalists, 

 these interruptions of the journey are likely to be many and long. 

 The eye soon learns to recognize good collecting-ground; and the 

 mere consideration that supper and a resting-place are miles farther 

 on, is lightly esteemed when the charms and hidden possibilities of a 

 wooded ravine weight the balance. The number of localities repre- 

 sented in this collection is therefore great, as would be expected from 

 the aliove considerations. Probably almost all of the species of mol- 

 lusks inhal)iting Maryland, from the SouthMountain to Cumberland, 

 were found by us; and as the southern tier of counties in Pennsyl- 

 vania is identical with Maryland in geologic and topographic features, 

 the list practicalh' tells what that jwrtion of Pennsylvania contains 

 of land and fresh-water shells. The list of a collection made l)y Mr. 

 Witmer Stone at York Furnace, York Co. , Pa., has been kindly 

 furnished by him, and the species occurring there are noted herein. 



The general tojtography and geology of these portions of Peinisyl- 

 vania and Maryland are well known. South Mountain, the Rlue 

 Ridge, Martin's M(»untain, SiiK-ling Mountain, Town Ridge, Wills 

 MountJiin, and numerous smaller intermediate ridges, cut this district 

 int<j a series of wide and narrow valleys, trending N. E. by S. W.; 




12 I'H(KKK1)IN(;S OK IHK ACADKMY OK [1894. 



each valley supplying a creek tributary to the Potomac. The valleys 

 are mostly eroded anticlines, so that a great variety of strata are ex- 

 posed ; hut sandy shales and shaly sandstone.-; predominate. 



The Potomac crosses this series of parallel I'idges nearly at a right 

 angle. It is everywhere shallow and rapids are frequent. At Cum- 

 berland it is <lamnied, and all the water which is not used by the city 

 water-works feeds the Cliesa[)eake and Ohio Canal, which has its 

 western terminus here. Above the backwater from this dam it is a 

 shallow rapid stream from forty to sixty feet wide, with a rocky, or in 

 places, gravelly bed ; and the low banks are fringed with graceful 

 maple, willow and sycamore trees, often festooned with grape vines, 

 and in places mingled with oak and locust. The water here is of a 

 dark se[)ia tint, being stained by the spruce sawdust from saw-mills 

 upon its upper course, and probably also by decaying laurel and 

 bay leaves, for the region above is densely wooded. No raollusk life 

 whatever could be found in this brown water, but minnows and tad- 

 poles were seen. Below the dam at Cumberland the wide river-bed 

 is dry, except for occasional pools, in which a few Plaiiorbis bicarina- 

 tus and Amiiieola liviosa live. 



Except in times of high water therefore, the lower course of the 

 river is an entirely distinct stream from this upper reach. About 

 ten miles below Cumberland the river has about the same volume as 

 the stream above the influence of the Cknuberland dam, and the 

 water is clpar. 



Wills Creek, which flows through the city of Cumberland, is a 

 swift stream with a rocky bed. The water is of crystal transparence, 

 but no snails excei)t Fianorbis bicarinafus were found in it. Evitt's 

 Creek, which drains the valley next eastward, contains Anculosa in 

 abundance.

Family ZONITID^. 



A complete rearrangement of the Amei'ican genera of this family 

 is necessary, and althougli a local faunal list may be considered 

 hardly the place for radical changes in nomenclature, still it may be 

 preferable to the perpetuation of an untenable system. The species 

 which were formerly referred to the genus Zonitcs will now be dis- 

 tributed into several genera, distinguished by important structural 

 peculiarities. 



The genus Zonites of Montfort has no representative in America, 

 being confined to the circum-^Iediterranean and adjacent faunas. In 

 this genus the shell is large, solid, opaque and discoidal, and is al- 

 ways strongly carinated, at least when young. The jaw has a strong 

 median projection; the genitalia lack all accessory organs, being of 

 the haplogonoufi type. The synonymy of the genus is as follows:

The generic characters of this group are as follows: 



Sliell ratlier large and solid but thin, umhilicated, smooth below, 

 lacking teeth or folds within; the lip simple and sharp. 



Foot double grooved above its margin, the grooves meeting above 

 the tail in a mucus pore; sole ti-ipartite; dorsal surface from head to 

 mantle entirely lacking longitudinal grooves. 



Genital system lacking dart sac and other accessory glands. See 

 under 0. fuligiiwsa, below. 



This genus contains the large Zonitoids of North America. It 

 has not been recognized as yet in Pahearctic regions. 



0. fuliginosa Griflf. PL 1, fig. 5. 



York Furnace, York County, Pa., 63,857. Collected by AVit- 

 mer Stone. No specimens were found by us in Maryland. 



The genital oi'gans of this species and its allies fceeni to have been 

 misinterpreted by writers on United States forms, who have mis- 

 taken the swollen base of the vas deferens for the penis, and have 

 considered the penis itself to be a dart sack or prostate gland of some 

 sort. 



In 0. fuliginosa, the penis (P.), is a rather short stout sac, with 

 the retractor muscle (r. p.) inserted at its apex, and attached dis- 

 tally to the floor of the lung. Internally the distal half of the 

 cavity of the penis is densely, finely and rather sharply granulated; 

 the opening of the vas deferens is near the apex of the cavity, and is 

 not provided with a papilla. The lower portion of the vas deferens 

 (v. d.) is enormously swollen; and for a short distance from its inser- 

 tion it is firmly bound to the penis itself. 



The vagina (vag.) is curiously swollen near the base. Thesperma- 

 theca (sp.) is large, siibglobular, and together with its rather long 

 duct, is bound firmly to the oviduct. The albumen gland {a. gl.) 

 is uncommonly large. 



The figure is drawn from a specimen collected by i\Ir. Witmer 

 Stone at York Furnace, York County, Pa. (No. 63,857). Several

 Vitrea is H. n-i/sf'tUina Miiller of Europe. There are a great many 

 generic synonyms, but part of the names quoted above are available 

 for sectional divisions. The American species must all be examined 

 to ascertain whether or not they possess a dart sac, as those having 

 this structure must be removed to the genus Gastrodojiki. I have 

 not had time to examine the soft parts of any of them.

 Shells of N. A., I, [). 292 (i)roposed for H. (/alar is

 The shell is provided wath internal teeth or lamelhe in the typical 

 forms of this genus. In another group, consisting of G. ligera and 

 its allies there are no teeth, but a strong white callus upon the floor 

 of the last whorl. In the section Zoiiitoides this callus is wanting, 

 and the whorls are rounded below. 



The prominent feature of the genitalia is the presence of a dart 

 sac containing a long curved calcareous dart, situated upon the va- 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 17 



gina; and this is the most important generic character. In PI. I, fig. 

 4, is shown the dart of G. Ikjera, magnified twelve diameters. 



There are strong reasons for believing that the presence of a dart, 

 the coronal glands being correlated with it, is a very old character in 

 Znititida', and that it was present in the nnditterentiated stock from 

 which nearly all the existing genera have diverged.' If this be true, 

 then Vltrea, Omphalina, etc., must be regarded as secondarily haplo- 

 gonous, having lost the dart apparatus which was present in their 

 ancestors.

P. tridentata juxtidens n. var. PI. 1, Fig. 8. 



Cave Town, Md., 64,720; very numerous in stony places. This 

 is a limestone region, and the red soil is largely the result of lime- 

 stone decomposition. The same form of TrioiJopsis was found at 

 Gettysburg, Pa., 64,710, and in Allegheny Co., Md., between 

 Green and Polish ^lountains, 64,716, Chewsville, Md., 64,717, at 

 Fairview, summit of North iNIountain, Md., and in Morgan Co., W. 

 Va., opposite Hancock, 64,718. It is common around Philadelphia, 

 where typical trideiitatn also occurs. 



This form is distinguished from typical tridentata by the lower 

 position of the upper lip-tooth, the latter part of the parietal 

 lamella being directed toward this tooth or to a point above 

 it, whilst in the ty})e the lip-teeth are more separated and 

 the latter portion of the parietal lamella is directed toward a 

 point on the peristome between them. The variety is more coarsely 

 striated also. The number of whorls (5) is the same in variety and 

 type. The measurements of three individuals are as follows : 



Alt. 7 diam. 14 mm. (Philadelphia). 



&i " lo] " (Cave Town, Md., largest). 

 6 " 11 " ( " " " smallest). 



The upper lip- tooth is sometimes broader than the lower, and oc- 

 casionally a trifle "inflected." The parietal blade is slightly 

 arcuate. 



P. tridentata fraudulenta n. var. PL 1. Fig. 6. 



Morgan Co., W. Va. , opposite Hancock, Md., 64,724 and 

 64,725; Cumberland, Md., 64,728. At both of these localities it 

 is found living with typical P. tridentata. 



In its typical development this variety is a compact shell of a red- 

 dish-brown color (varying to white in some localities); the spire is 

 low-convex, composed of six closely coiled whorls, the last being nota- 

 bly deflexed in front and strongly constricted behind the lip. The 

 aperture is strongly "dished" or basin-shaped; the outer lip bears a 

 broad tongue-shaped inflected tooth, situated at the position of the 

 periphery of the shell. The middle of the basal lip bears a small 

 s(|uarish tubercle, which is often laterally compressed. The parietal

 straight and never much curved.

The tooth upon the outer lip is generally bifid, Binney's figures 

 of Triodopsi.-^ fallax (Man. Amer. L, Sh., p. 292, lig. 314) represent 

 a form of this subspecies, but not its typical development. That 

 this is not the true H. fallax of Say will be evident to anyone com- 

 paring it with the original description. The characters of the two 

 are best shown in the followintr table :

No shells exhibiting the characters of friiidi(le)itii have been found 

 in the cis-Alleghenian region of eastern Pennsylvania or New Jer- 

 sey, so far as I can juilge by the collections of Philadelphia concholo- 

 gi.sts, which c()ver a great many localities and a long series of years. 

 This region is inhabited by typical tridenhdn, its variety jit.rtideii.s, 

 and by the "//. iidrofereiis" of Bland and authors generally. 



P. fallax Say. 



Gettysburg, Pa., (54,722. The variations of the trideutata group 

 of Triodopxis are an extremely intricate study, and strange as it may 

 seem, the names hitherto attached to some of tlu- forms rc(piire re- 

 vision. ILdix Jalla.c was described l»y Say from the vicinity of Phila- 

 delphia; but the form heretofore so calleil is not found near Philadel- 

 phia, rvor has it been within the present century, if ever. Tlic 

 Triodojhws foimd in this vicinity are (I) I\ Iridrnfn/a Say, typical; 

 (2) P. trldentufi jiixti(leii)< ; and (3) /'. iiifioj'iirii.-iH\m\i\. These

mens eulh'Clfd many years ago a.< well as by others taken during the 

 past year; and no other forms or species have to my knowledge lieen 

 found anywhere near Philadelphia. 



The conclusion that one of these three is the fallax of Say is there- 

 fore an extremely probable one. Upon turning to Say's original 

 description (Journ. Acad. Nat. Sci., V, p. 119) we find that it aj> 

 plies exactly to the shell known as Helix iutroferens Bid. Say men- 

 tions the parietal tooth "curving downwards so as to nearly reach the 

 termination of the lal)rum" and says : "This resend)les the trideu- 

 tiit I nob., but the upper tooth of the labrum is much inflected, the 

 spire is more elevated, and the size is less considerable. " He gives the 

 tliameter as " nine-twentieths of an inch," which is exactly the size 

 of the Philadelphia " introferenn" It should be addeil that Say's 

 types of frideiif'it I andfidlax are no longer in existence. In view of 

 the facts of the case, it seems to me necessary to use Say's name /"'//- 

 lax tor the species hitherto called introferen.% the latter becoming a 

 synonym. 



The prominent features of this shell, besides its elevated spire and 

 and inflected upper tooth, are the angular curvature of the parietal 

 tooth, and the continuation inward of the basal tooth and the callus 

 around the •' profound sinus " between the two lip-teeth.

Family PLEUEOCERIDiE. 



Genus ANCULOSA Say. 



A. carinata Biuk. 



This .species is the characteristic niollusk of perennial streams in the 

 Chesapeake Bay river-system. It has l^eeu found only in waters of 

 this drainage, lieing unknown in the adjacent Delaware .system on 

 the north-ea.-:t, in the Ohio system on the west, and in streams empty- 

 ing into the Atlantic to the south of Chesapeake Bay. 



A)iculosa being essentially a trans-Allegheuian genus, we may 

 with considerable confidence surmise that the ancestors of A. rariit- 

 ain were introduced into the head waters of the Potomac from some 

 creek (if the Ohio system, and from this colony spread throughout the 

 Chesapeake drainage. The fact that it inhabits the James River 

 and other Virginian streams which are now isolated from the Poto- 

 mac and Su.<(|Uehanna by a long stretch of salt water, indicates that 

 .since the introduction of Aiicit/o^'i, and the ditferention of the species 

 ciiriiiatii, the Chesapeake region has been much more elevated than 

 it is at present. Anciilom can endure neither salt nor slow-flowing 

 water; and it must have spread to these various streams at a time 

 when the united waters of the Susquehanna, Potomac, Rappahan- 

 nock and James Rivers flowed in one mighty stream to the Atlantic. 

 It may be suggested that the distribution has been accomplished 

 overland; but this is highly improbable; for if so, why is the species 

 so strictly limited to the Chesapeake system? Why has it not invaded 

 the Delaware-Schuylkill drainage, which offers ecpuilly favorable 

 station.s, and is separated by but a few miles from the eastern tribu- 

 taries of the Susquehanna? AVe mu.«t conclude that Strepoinafiihr 

 require as a rule actual water communication for their spread from 

 stream t<j stream. The exceptions are probably rare and unimpor- 

 tant. 



The presence of this species in the headwatei-s of the Roanoke 

 River at the hamlet of Lafayette, Montgomery Co., Va., is readily 

 accounted for by the close proximity of the creeks forming the head 

 of the James and those flowing into the Roanoke. Some time a 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 27 



rivulet inhabited by Anculosa was "stolen" from the James by the 

 Roanoke draiuase, thus transferring the species." 



Go)iiob<if<is virf/inira is apparently a much older resident of the 

 eastern country. It ranges from the Connecticut River (at Deep 

 River, Conn.) to middle Virginia. The genus Goniobasis is known 

 to be a much more ancient group geologically. 



The distribution of Anculosa carinata is pretty thoroughly known 

 by the localities given in Tryon's monograph, and the specimens in 

 the collection of the Philadelphia Academy and the U. S. National 

 Museum.'' It extends northward to the headwaters of the Susque- 

 hanna in New York State. Both of the collections named possess 

 specimens said to be from regions outside of the Chesapeake drain- 

 age, such as "Ohio," "Lake Erie," etc., audDeKay reports it from 

 "Lake Champlain;" but these localities are, there is not much 

 doubt, false. The older collectors were not so punctilious about cor- 

 rect habitats for their shells as we have now learned to be; and in 

 the absence of confirmation by later collections the evidence of these 

 old labels must be held insufficient. Lakes Champlain and Erie, 

 and the State of Ohio, are now well known lo many ardent and 

 reliable students of conchology, and such a conspicuous shell as A. 

 carindfa would not be overlooked by them. 



The following localities are represented in the collections made by 

 Mr. Ives and myself: 



Susquehanna River, York Co., 62,(S20, collected by Witmer 

 Stone. Specimens small, 8-10 mm. long. Apices much eroded.

HOMOLOGIES OF THE ALISPHENOID AND PETROMASTOID BONES IN 

 VERTEBRATES. 



BY HENRY C. CHAPMAN, M. D. 



To those unfamiliar with moderu views upon the morpliology of 

 the skull it may not be known that any difference of oi)inion still pre- 

 vails amoim' anatomists as to what hones in the skull of the lower ver- 

 tebrates should be regarded as homologues or representatives of the 

 great wing of the sphenoid and petromastoid in the skull of INIan and 

 other mammalia. Considering the numerous and important palreon- 

 tological and embryological researches made in recent years, and in 

 view of the fact that the remains of extinct animals and the develop- 

 ment and structure of existing ones have been described so elabor- 

 ately, it might naturally be supposed that the question of the special 

 homologies of the bones of the skull would have long since been de- 

 finitely settled. 



So far, however,^ from this being the case, as a matter of fact anato- 

 mists, in certain instances at least, on the one hand desiijnate the 

 same bone by different names and on the other, different bones 

 by the same name. The confusion of ideas thus engendered by ob- 

 scure nomenclature makes it often very difficult to understand what 

 particular bone is referred to, especially when the description relates 

 to the cranial bones of some extinct animal. Apart from this con- 

 sideration it is obvious that unless the special homologies of the bones 

 of the skull of different vertebrates are determined, and identical 

 bones be designated by the same name, it will be impossible to assign 

 to an animal its proper position in the order of Nature or determine 

 its phylogeny in the light of evolution, especially if the animal be 

 an extinct one and its natural affinities obscure. The hope of dis- 

 sipating some of the confusion prevailing as to the nomenclature of 

 certain of the bones in the skull of Man and other vertebrates prompts 

 the author to sulimit a resume of some well-known osteological facts 

 with, however, an interpretation of the same not hitherto presented, at 

 least as far as known to him. Even if the latter be not accepted, 

 the determination of the synonyms of the bones in question may, at 

 least, not prove superfluous hereafter to co-workers in this field 

 of research.

The prevailiug view among anatomists at the present day appears 

 to be that the petroniastoid portion of the tenijioral bone is deveh)pe(l 

 in Man from three distinct centres of ossification, named respectively 

 prootic, opisthotic and e[notic; that the prootic and opisthotic coalesce 

 to foi-ni the pars petrosa, the epiotic giving rise to the specially mas- 

 toid part of the pars niastoidea, and later joining the other two. 



According to this view tlie homologues of these three centres of 

 ossification of the petroniastoid of Man exist in the skull of the 

 lower vertebrata either as distinct bones or more or less coalesced with 

 each other or with adjacent bones. The bone formerly considered as 

 the homologue of the great wing of the sphenoid or the alisphenoid, 



Figs. 1, 2, a is regarded 

 as the prootic or the homo- 

 logue of the upper part of 

 the human pars petrosa. 

 The alisphenoid proper, f, is 

 often ])ut little developed 

 or even absent in the skull 

 of the lower vertebrates ; 

 the bone formerly named 

 occipital externe or par- 

 FiG. 1. Side view of hmnnn skull. occipital is regarded as 



the homologue of the opisthotic or epiotic, while the latter is 

 often re[)resented by a small ossification coalesced with the supi'a oc- 

 cipital. 



So far as known to the author Kerckringius is usually regarded as 

 _^-_^- having been the first anatomist to describe 



the petromastoid portion of the temporal 

 bone as developed from three centres of ossi- 

 fication. Unless the author has misunder- 

 stood the meaning of the text, however, that 

 which Kerckringius refers to as being devel- 

 oped from three centres of ossification is not 

 the whole petromastoid but only that part of 

 the pars petrosa which constitutes the mam- 

 millary process or pars mastoidea, the pars 

 p petrosa proper having been more or less de-

34 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



lu the fifth chapter of his Osteogeaia Foetorum/ published in 

 1690, Kerckringius observes : " Ossis petrosi pars ilia, quae pro- 

 cessuni niammilluarem constituit, terna de novo acquisivit ossicula; 

 ununi pyriforuia, acutiore, sui parte squamoso anuectitur; alterum 

 scutum ovale referens, niagnitudiue, priori vix cedens, media cartila- 

 giue ab eo separatur; uti <kc., tertiura ah utroque, quam vis hoc 

 magnitudine neutri sit ae(juiparaudum, vix aciculae majoris caput 

 adaequan?; sunt autem eositu online collocata, quern tabula foetus v, 

 mensium, usurpata oculis facilius ad mentem quam verba trausmit- 

 tet, . . . Constat ergo os temporum hoc quinio mense sex dis- 

 tiuctis ossiculis; osse videlicet, squamoso, anulo, osse internam 

 civitatem ettormaute etc., tribus notabilibus quae hoc mense ex orta 

 esse dixiraus. Sexto mense pyriforme, &c. ovale scutiforme coalue- 

 runtinunum: tertium non uihil auctuni est magnitudine. 

 Septimo mense jam tertium illud ossiculum duobus mense superiore 

 inter se coalitis accessit." 



That these three centras of ossification, viz., the "pyriforma," 

 "scutum ovale" and "tei'tium" do not correspond exactly to the 

 prootic, epiotic and opisthotic centres in the sense in which these 

 terms are used by modern anatomists, appears from the text of the 

 hitter part of the passage quoted, beginning " constat ergo," the tem- 

 poral bone being said to consist at the fifth month of six distinct os- 

 sicles, which would be impossible if two of the "tribus notabilibus" 

 coalesced to form the "osse internam cavitatem etformante," which, 

 however, as we shall see hereafter, they do a little later. That by 

 the "osse inteniam civitatem efformante " is meant that part of the 

 pars petrosa developed before and independent of the appearance of 

 the three distinct ossicles becomes evident from the description of the 

 state of the development of the temporal bone at the previous or 

 fourth month, Kerckringius stating that the l)oue at the end of that 

 month con.sists of thi-ee ossicles : "annulo," " osse squamoso " and 

 "illo jam commemorato," the latter being the " osse internam" or 

 that part of the i)ars petrosa developed at that period. ' ' Quarto 

 mense mirum visu, quam cito & quanto perfectione os squamosum 

 magnam ])artem factum sit osseum. Os petrosum jam rubicunda

Farther, according to Kerckringius the "pyriforma" (prootic) 

 coalesces at tlie sixth month with the "scutum ovale" (epiotic) to 

 form one bone, the latter being joined at the seventh month by the 

 " tertium illud ossiculum" (opisthotic), whereas, as we shall show, 

 it is the opisthotic and not the epiotic that combines with the prootic 

 to form the pars petrosa. As to what Kerckringius meant by his 

 " tria petrosi ossis distinctu ossicula," we will try to make clear in 

 our description of the manner in which the petromastoid develops 

 in Man. 



The work ' ' De Aure Humana " liy Cassebohm appeared in 1734- 

 1735. The description of the development of the ear given by 

 this author, while agreeing in the main with that of Kerckringius, 

 differs from it in some respects. Cassebohm recognized, however, 

 with Kerckringius, the fact of the pars petrosa being more or less os- 

 sified before the appearance of the " tria ossicula," as shown by 

 numerous passages in liis text as well as by his excellent figures.' 



In the judgment of the autlior, Meckel, rather than Kerckringius 

 or Cassebohm, was the first anatomist to describe the petromastoid of 

 the temporal bone as arising from three distinct centres of ossifica- 

 tion. xVccording to this author^ the first part of the labyrintli to os-

tlie -preadini; ossification protliices the floor of the hiljyriQth. The 

 second centre of ossification arising at the extreme end of the su- 

 perior vertical canal, gives rise to the internal auditory meatus and 

 the Hoor of the cochlea. The third centre of ossification begins as a 

 scale upon the middle of the internal vertical semi- circular canal. 



It is to be inferred that Meckel supposed the mastoid is developed 

 from the latter centre, for though he does not say so in the passage 

 just referred to, as he had some years previously"^ expressed the view 

 that the mastoid is developed from a special centre distinct from that 

 forming the [)ars petrosa, and as the latter is formed according to 

 Meckel from the first two centres, the only centre remaining to form 

 the mastoid is the third centre, that beginning as a scale upon the in- 

 ternal vertical semi-circular canal. 



In his well known work on the temporal bone Hallmann also ex- 

 pi-esses the view that the mastoid portion is developed from a special 

 centre of ossification, offering as a proof thereof the fact of his being 

 able to scrape off, in certain specimens of the dried skull, the third 

 oval centre of ossification without injuring the semi-circular canal. "^ 

 In 1848 Rathke, in describing the development of the turtle, re- 

 garded the two bones, the rocher^ and occipital externe^ of Cuvier, 

 which, according to this author, form the labyrinth, as corresponding 

 when taken together to the pars petrosa of the temporal bone of 

 higher vertebrates: — " Die Knorpel Kapsel, welche sich audi bein

About the same time the late Professor Owen'", in referrinu- to the 

 views of Kerckriiioiuf* as to there being "tria petrosa ossis di.stincta 

 ossicuhv," called attention to the primary independence of the base 

 of the processus mastoideus as " a fact of much more significance 

 than its brief and transitory manifestation would lead the author to 

 divine." He further ol)served that "in the cold blooded vertebrates 

 the mastoid retains with a few exceptions its primary embryonic dis- 

 tinctness as an independent element of the skull." It should be 

 mentioned in this connection, h(^wever, that as Professor Owen re- 

 garded the bone now considered in the lower vertebrata as the 

 squamosal to be the homologue of the special centre of ossification of 

 the human pars niastoidoa, he called it accordingly the mastoid. 



In 1861 the view of Meckel as to the original distinctness in the 

 embryo of the three j)arts of the petromastoid portion of the tem- 

 poral bone wiis confirmed by Kolliker" in his description of the de- 

 velopment of that bone in Man. 



Finally, Professor Huxley in his lectures as Hunteriau Professor 

 at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, in 1868, and em- 

 bodied substantially in his "Lectures on the Elements of Compara- 

 tive Anatomy," '■ developed at length and in detail the view that the 

 petromastoi<l j)ortion of the temporal bone in man is developed from 

 three centres as described by Meckel and Kolliker, and further that 

 tliese three centres are represented in the lower vertebrata as more 

 or less distinct bones as held by Kathke and Owen. 



The two bones described by Kathke as forming in the turtle the 

 "felsenbein" were luimed by Prof. Huxley the prootic' ' and opistho- 

 tic"; that regarded by Owen as the mastoid was considered by Prof 

 Huxley to be the s(puimosal'', and the "specially mastoid" })art of 

 the "pars mastoidea" the "scutum ovale referens" of Kerckringius

38 P KOCEEDINCfS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



The vii'W of the morpliology and termiiioh)gy of the periotic cajv 

 siile aud adjacent bones as sustained by Prof. Huxley and most other 

 anatomists of the present day is based upon two assumptions : 



1st. That the petro-mastoid portion of the temporal bone in Man 

 develops from three distinct centers of ossification named respectively 

 prootic, opisthotic and epiotic and represented in the skull of the 

 the lower vertebrata by three bones bearing respectively the same 

 three names and more or less coalesced with each other or adjacent 

 bones. 



2d. That the bone lying in front of the exit of tlie inferior niax- 

 illiary division of the fifth nerve should be regarded in the lower 

 vertel)rata as the homologiie of the great wing of the sphenoid in ]Man 

 and named the alisphenoid, and the bone lying behind such exit as 

 homologous with the upper part of the pars petrosa of ^Nlan and 

 named the prootic. 



The conclusion that follows if these two assunn)tions be admitted, 

 will be tiiat the alisphenoid or homologue of the great wing of the 

 sphenoid is often but little developed or may lie even absent in the 

 skull of the lower vertebrata, its place being supplied by the prootic 

 bone or the homologue of the upper part of the pars petrosa of man. 



Motwithstanding the high authority of Meckel, Kolliker, Huxley 

 and others, among whom may be mentioned the late W. Kitcben 

 Parker, universally conceded while living to be the highest authority 

 on all (piestions pertaining to the development and morphology of 

 the skull, the three-fold development of the petro-mastoid portion of 

 the temporal bone has been denied by anatomists and notably by the 

 late Dr. Joseph Leidy. '' 



The author having had occasion recently to study the devolopnieut 

 of the temporal bone in Man has satisfied himself, at least, that the 

 mastoid portion of the petrosal is not developed from a special centre 

 ()f ossification but from the petrosal and s(|uaniosal portions of the 

 temporal as described by Leidy,"* and tliat there is no homologue, 

 therefore, in the skull of Man, of the bone described as the epiotic 

 in that of the lower vertebrata. Further, while there is no doubt 

 that the petrosal part of the temporal in Man is developed, as we shall

see preseatly, from two distinct ceutres of ossification, tliese two 

 centres, in the judgment of the author are not so exactly repre- 

 sented in the skull of the lower vertebrata that the names pro- 

 otic and opisthotic can be given them. 



At a period about the middle of the fifth month of intra-uterine 

 life the temporal bone exhibits, according to the dissections of the 

 author, three distinct ossifications: the squamosal, the tympanic and 

 a ring surrounding the foramen rotundum of the otherwise cartila- 

 ginous labyrinth. A little later a second centre of ossification makes 

 its appearance at the extreme end of the superior vertical canal. 

 From these two centres of ossification, which we will name the uj)|)er 

 and lower otic, as indicating their situation in ^[:ul, there arise, due 

 to progressive ossification extending through the labyrinth, tlie [)ars 

 petrosa and two- thirds of the pars mastoidea of the temporal, the 

 remaining third of the latter being developed from the squamosal. 

 From the lower otic ring-like ossific centre surrounding the foramen 

 rotundum arise all that part of the pars petrosa seen beneath the 

 cranium, viz.: the lower part of the cochlea, the promonotory, and 

 lower part of the fenestra ovalis, the fenestra rotunda, the lower 

 arm of the jiosterior semicircidar canal, the lower part of the facial 

 canal, jugular fossa, the carotid canal and the fioor of the tyrapan- 

 num. From the u[)per otic ossific centre, (that appearing on the 

 superior vertical canal) arise all that part of the pars petrosa seen 

 within the cranium excejjt that entering into the formation of the 

 jugular fossa, viz.: the upper part of the cochlea including the cupola 

 and the base, the iuternal auditory meatus, the upper part of the 

 fenestra ovalis, the upper arm of the posterior and the superior and 

 vertical .semicircular canals, the up[)er part ol" the facial canal, the 

 tegmen tympani. 



The various structures just described as resi)ectively j)roduced trom 

 the two ossific centres having coalesced about the eighth month''' or even 

 earlier, to form the os.seous labyrinth, there is developed as a continuous 

 outgrowth of the latter the pyramidal and mastoid portions of the 

 j)etro8al, the mastoid being formed more especially by outgrowths 

 from the posterior and external semicircular canals. The outgrowth 

 from the posterior semicircular canal appears sis an "elliptical islet"'"

 tal and occipital bones and consti- 

 tuting, therefore, part of the wall of 

 the cranium. The elliptical islet 

 havinir been developed, a second 

 "quadrate " islet (Fig. 3, 4, q) now 

 appears in the cartilage and more 

 [)articularly in the part of it lying 

 between the elliptical islet and the 

 squamosal. The two islets, the ellip- 

 tical and quadrate, subsequently 

 uniting together form the mastoid 

 portion of the petrosal. If the lat- 

 ter be developed in the manner just described then the " pyrifor- 

 ma " and "scutum ovale" of Kerckringius would be the parts 

 described by Leidy as the "elliptical" and "quadrate" 

 islets, since the former, like the latter, "coalescent in unum" 



but not to the prootic and opistho- 

 tic centres, since the latter are de- 

 veloped and coalesce before the islets 

 even appear, and for the reason 

 already given that it is the pyri- 

 forma or prootic and the scutum 

 ovale or epiotic that unite according 

 to Kerckringius, not the prootic 

 and opisthotic. 



The third ossicle of Kerckringius, however, the "vix acicuUe 

 iiiajoris caput adaequans" corresponds to tliat part of the lower otic 

 or opisthotic that, growing outward and backward, makes its ap- 

 pearance at the edge of the tympanic ring at an 

 early period of intra-uterine life and which soon 

 combines, as we have seen, with the upper otic or 

 prootic to form the pars petrosa, the latter subse- 

 \ quently uniting with the S(juamosal to form the 

 V mastoid portion of the temporal.

 by Owen '■' as mastoid and paroccipital, and by Huxley " as squa- 

 mosal and epiotic in the fish and squamosal and opisthotic in 

 the turtle? In reply to such quexy, in the judirnient of the author 

 the bone, No. 8, (Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8) described by Cuvier as mastoidien 

 and by Owen as mastoid in the skull of the lower vertebrates, 

 should be reuarded as it is by Huxley and most modern 



anatomists, as the homologue of the 

 squamosal (Fig. 3, s) of the temporal 

 of jNIan. The bone No. 4, (Figs. 5, 

 8, the occipital externe (perch) Cu- 

 vier, the paroccipital of Owen, the 

 epiotic of Huxley in fish, opisthotic

of the occipital bone or the 



middle of the condyle towards the roots of the mastoid process."^* 



The name occipital externe, or its 

 English equivalent external occipi- 

 tal, may as well then be retained 

 for the bone No. 4 as simply ex- 

 pressing the fact that there exist'^ in

bone lying external to the su|)ra and ex-occipital irrespective of any 

 preconceived hypotheses. The names paroccipital and e[)iotic should 

 l)e discarded, as the former implies that the bone No. 4 is the para- 

 pophysis of the first cranial vertebra, the latter that it is the 

 hoin;)logue of the special centre of ossification of the mastoid in Man. 

 It has been urged in favor of the bone No. 4 being called the epi- 

 otic in the fish that it eaters into the formation of the ear-chamber, 

 its inner surface being excavated for the reception of part ot the 

 posterior and external semicircular canal. Such argument, howt'ver, 

 loses all force when it is remembered that the exoccipital is similarly

 same characters and similar relations as in 

 the fish, is usually described in that animal 

 and in the alligator, etc., as tlie opisthotic bone, 

 the epiotic being supposed then to be repre- 

 sented by an independent centre of ossifica- 

 tion which, while distinct at an early period 

 of life, later coalesces with the supra-occipi-

skull of turtle. Even if such be universally the case it 



would only prove that either the suj)ra-occipital develops in reptilia 

 from two centres in the embryo, or that there exists a bone (epiotic) 

 in the skull of reptiles that has no homologue in that of fish or Man, 

 not that the bone No. 4 is the opisthotic. Indeed, as we shall see 

 presently, there is no reason to believe that an opisthotic bone that 

 is the supposed homologue of the rocher or petrosal in the fish (cod) 

 of the lower part of the pars petrosa of Man exists in the skull of 

 the reptile (turtle) at all. 



Admitting that the petroraastoid portion of the temporal bone in 

 ]\ran develo})S from two centres of ossification, it remains now to de- 

 termine whether there exists in the skull of a cod-fish, snake, turtle 

 or alligator the homologue of these two centres, two bones to which 

 the names prootic and opisthotic can be appropriately given and 

 which, taken together, represent therefore the pars petrosa of the 

 of the temporal bone in Man. 



In considering this question let us begin by first pointing out in 

 what respect the bone No. 6, (Fig. 6) in the cod resembles and 

 differs from the prootic or u])per portion of the human pars 

 petrosa, (Fig. 2, p). It resembles it in its inner concavity 

 usually supporting the anterior part of the vestibule and the 

 anterior vertical semicircular canal. It differs from it in not 

 presenting a fenestra ovalis, a cochlear roof, osseous semicircular 

 canals, internal auditory meatus or tegraen tympaui, no such parte

being present in the cod, and in not transmitting tlie portio dura of 

 the seventh nerve, the latter also not existing in the cod-fish. ■" If the 

 hone No. 6 in the cod-fish be compared, however, with the great 

 wing of the sphenoid in Man (Figs. 1, 2, a) it will be observed that it 

 agrees with the latter (alisphenoid) in articulating with that part of 

 the basi- cranial axis corresponding to the basi-sphenoid, and with the 

 j)arietals in entering into the formation of the lateral wall of the 

 cranium, sui)porting the mesencephalon, and in being notched anter- 

 iorly (perforated in the carp) for the transmission of the superior and 

 inferior maxillary branches of the fifth nerve. The bone No. 6 in 

 the cod differs from the alisphenoid in Man, as ah-eady mentioned, in 

 supporting pai't of the membranous labyrinth and in the notch trans- 

 mitting the inferior maxillary branch of the fifth nerve being situated 

 in the anterior part of the lioue rather than in the posterior part as 

 is the case in ^Nlan. 



In the consideration of the relative posterior of the notch c in the 

 l)one No. 6 in the fish and that of the foramen ovale in the alis- 

 phenoid of ]Man, (Fig. 2, fo), the fact appears to have 'been entirely 

 lost sight of that the notch or foramen in the fish corresponds to two 

 distinct foramina in Man: the foramen rotuudum, (Fig. 2, r) and 

 the foramen ovale, (Fig. 2, fo) transmitting respectively the super- 

 ior and inferior maxillary branches of the fifth nerve, and that the 

 part of the notch in the fish, (Fig. 6, V ) corresponding to the foramen 

 rotundum in Man, is situated anteriorly just as is the case in Man. 

 The situation of the exit of the superior maxillary nerve is therefore 

 substantially the same in the bone No. (5 in the cod (and absolutely 

 so in the carp) as in the alisphenoid of Man. The objection that 

 might still be urged that that part of the notch corresponding to the 

 foramen ovale is situated anteriorly in the fish but posteriorly in 



-'■Tlic iuitlior is familiar with tlie viiw onti-rtaincfl by some anatomists that 

 liyomaiidiltular hianclu-s of the fif'tli nerve represent in 1 lie fish Iho branches of 

 the i)urtio dura of tlie seventh nerveor facial in Man. Such an interiiretation 

 is, however, niitenahle. bein;; based U]ion the assumption that the (|uailrate bime

 bone together with the others entering into the formation of the lower jaw of the 

 alligator are not represented in Man.

Man liiis no significance, since in Man and mammals generally there is 

 always a small portion of the alisphenoid behind the foramen ovale, 

 amounting, indeed, in the sheep to about one-half the bone. 



The statement often made that the bone lying behind the exit of 

 tlie fifth nerve is the homologue of the upper part of the human pars 

 petrosa is simply not correct so far as concerns Man and mammals. 



In view of the facts just mentioned some anatomists have con- 

 sidered the bone Xo. 6 in the fish a.s the homologue of the alisphen- 

 oid in Man and have so named it. Other anatomists, on the other 

 hand, impressed with the fact that the bone supports a part of the 

 membranous labyrinth, have regarded it as the homologue of the 

 u[)per part of tlie human pars petrosa and called it accordingly pro- 

 otic. In the judgment of the author an insuperable objection to 

 accepting the latter view is that it involves the inevitable but absurd 

 conclusion that its homologue, or the prootic portion of the pars 

 petrosa, must transmit the superior and inferior maxillary branches 

 of the fifth nerve. On the other hand, it might be urged that the 

 bone No. G can not be the homologue of the alisphenoid in Man 

 since the latter never supports any part of the membranous labyrinth. 

 In reply to the latter objection, though at the risk of committing a 

 petitio principii, the author must say that it is just in this respect 



that the skull of the cod- 

 fish differs from that of 

 Man : The bone No. 6, 

 in the fish, the homo- 

 logue of the alisphenoid 

 in Man, protects the an- 

 terior part of the laby- 

 rinth as is done by the 

 upper part of the human 

 pars petrosa, the differ- 

 ence being conditioned 

 by the part of the mem-

 alent alisphenoid (Owen) retained."' If the bone No. 6 in the skull of 

 the python (Fig. 7), turtle (Fig. 10), alligator (Figs. 9, 11), be 

 compared with that so numbered in the cod-fish (Fig. 6), it will 

 be found that while it resembles the latter in articulating with the 

 hasispheuoid and parietal bones, entering into the formation of 

 the lateral wall ot the cranium, presenting a notch or foramen for 

 the transmission of the superior and inferior maxillary branches 

 of the fifth nerve and protecting the anterior part ot the organ 

 of hearing, it difiers from it in transmitting the filaments of the 

 portio dura and mollis of the seventh nerve and in forming the 

 anterior half of the fenestra ovalis of the vestibule. 



In the latter respects, and in protecting the anterior part ot the 

 labyrinth, the bone No. 6 in the reptile certainly resembles

fifth nerve is irreconcilable, as in the ca.se of the fish, with the idea 

 that it is the homologue of the upper prootic portion of the human 

 pars petrosa. On the other hand, if the bone No. 6 in the reptile be 

 regarded as the homologue of the ali.sphenoid in ]Man the difficulty 

 presents itself that the former entere into the formation of the fenestra 

 ovalis and traur^mits in the reptile the filaments of the facial and 

 acoustic nerves, which the alisphenoid of Man never does, the fenestra 

 rotunda and the nerves being confined to the pars petrosa. With 

 the view of reconciling these difficulties the bone No. 6 in the reptile 

 has been regarded by some anatomists as consisting really of two 

 bones fused into one, the anterior and posterior ])arts being viewed 

 respectively as alisphenoid and prootic bones. 



The study of the development of the reptilian skull offers some 

 confirmation of this view, since as a matter of fact, according to 

 Parker,"' the bone No. 6 in the snake develops from two centres, the 

 anterior of which is regarded as the alisphenoid, the posterior as the 

 prootic. If the latter view be accepted the result of development in 

 the skull of the snake is very different from that in Man, since the 

 prootic ossification, instead of combining with the opisthotic to form 

 the pars petrosa, unites with the alisphenoid to form one bone. 

 Further, it does not follow because the bone No. 6 develops from two 

 centers of ossification that it must necessarily be regarded as consist- 

 ing of two distinct bones, any more than the basi sphenoid must be 

 regarded as consisting of three bones because it develops from three 

 centres.*" It seems to the author that the view most reconcilable 

 with the facts of develo^jmeut as well as those relating to the adult 

 condition of the skull is to regard the bone No. 6 in the reptile as the 

 homologue of the bone so numbered in the fish and of the alisphenoid 

 in Man. 



In the absence of a pars petrosa in the skull of the reptile and 

 bird some other bone or bones must fulfil the functions of that bone 

 in supporting and protecting the labyrinth and in transmitting the 

 facial and acoustic nerves. These functions are filled in the reptile 

 more or less by the bones Nos. 6, 4, 2, 3, which we regard as the 

 alisphenoid, external occipital, ex- occipital and supra-occipital, or.

in regard to the latter more particularly, its inferior and internal 

 part (epiotic),-'' No. 3 + (Fig. 9). 



There remains now lor consideration the question as to how much 

 of the lower portion of the human pars petrosa is represented in the 

 skull of the lower vertebrata. In other words, is there any distinct 

 bone in the skull of the lower vertebrata to which the name opistho- 

 tic can be appropriately given ? In the skull of the cod-fish, as in 

 that of the Gadidae generally, there exists, though often but little 

 developed or even absent in many fishes, a large and conspicuous 

 bone, No. 16, (Fig. 6) which articulates with the basi- occipital, basi- 

 sphenoid, ex-occipital, par-occipital, squamosal and alisphenoid bones 

 and forms the posterior lateral wall of the cranium. This bone, No. 

 16, on account of supporting that part of the membranous labyrinth 

 containing the otolithes has been usually regarded by anatomists (Cuv- 

 ier, Owen, Huxley) tis corresponding to the whole of the human pars 

 petrosa or at least to some part of it, and has been accordingly named 

 rocher. petrosal, opisthotic, etc. In the fish the labyrinth, however, is 

 not exclusively and entirely enclosed by a special osseous' covering as in 

 Man. The cavity enclosing the organ of hearing is formed not only 

 l)y the IjoneNo. 16, but by the alisphenoid, ex-occipital, par-occipital, 

 3(piaraosal and post- frontal bones as well. It opens widely into the 

 cranial cavity. It presents nothing comparable to the fenestra ovalis 

 and fenestra rotunda of the pars petrosa. Such being the case it is 

 impossible to determine whether the bone No. 16 in the fish repre- 

 sents the whole, or only a portion and more particularly the lower or 

 opisthotic portion of the human pars petrosa. The author would 

 therefore i)refer to cull the l)one No. 16 in the fish simply the rocher 

 or its equivalent, the petrosal, as indicating the probability of it cor- 

 responding to some part of the human pars petrosa. 



The term opistiiotic is objectionable as not only imi)lying that the 

 bone No. 16 in the fish corresponds to the lower or opisthotic part of 

 the human pars petrosa, for wiiich view there is no evidence, l)ut 

 further, for the reason already given that it is the bone No. 4 in the 

 fish, not the bone No. 16, that is the honiologue of the extiMiial 

 occipital, the so-culled opisthotic in the turtle. Indeed, the bone 

 No. 16 of the fish does not apjxjar to be represented as such either in

the reptile or in the higher vertebrata. In some respects it is a 

 peculiarly ichthyic bone though not invariably present even within 

 the limits of the class, as already mentioned. 



The ear-chamber in reptiles is more or less closed, internally at 

 least, in the adult condition by three bones separated by a Y-shaped 

 suture distinctly visible in the longitudinally divided skull (Fig. 9). 

 The two lower, No. 2, 6, (Fig. 9,) of the three bones are situated 

 on cither side of the vertical stem of the Y-shaped suture, the third 

 remaining bone No. 3 within the diverging branches of the latter. 

 Externally the osseous vestibule presents a fenestra rotunda fur 

 (Fig. 11), situated entirely within the bone No. 2 and a fenestra ovalis, 

 /mo, the posterior half of which is formed by the margin of the bone just 

 mentioned, the anterior half by that of the bone No. 6. The mem- 

 branous labyrinth consists of a vestibule, semicircular canal and, in 

 the turtle and alligator, of a rudimentary cochlea. The fenestrie are 

 closed by membranes in the living animal and to that of the fenestra 



P ovalis is attached a col- 



/^ umellar-like bone which, 



on account of being con- 

 WXT uected with the mem- 

 -2. brana tympani, is re- 

 garded as the homologue 

 of the stapes of the hu- 

 man ear. The membra- 

 na tympani is attach- 

 ed in turn to bone

 representing either the tympanic bone or the malleus in Man.'" 



The tympanic membrane being so superficially situated, neither 

 external auditory meatus nor external ear can be said to exist in 

 reptdes. The nearest approach to an external ear is seen in the 

 crocodilia which are provided with two cutaneous folds situated just

 tachian tube, ]ME. Further passages extend from each tympanum, 

 Q, through the quadrate, thence by a membranous tube into the 

 articulare of the lower jaw.^^ 



In the turtle the most posterior of the two lower bones entering 

 into the formation of the ear-chandler is a distinct bone, No. 4, (Fig. 

 1 ), and, for reasons already given, is regarded by the author as homo- 

 logous witli the external occipital of the fish and is therefore similarly 

 numbered and named. In the lizard, python and alligator the 

 functions of the external occipital bone of the turtle, No. 4, (Fig. 10), 

 are, liowever, filled by what appeals, in the adult skull at least, to be 

 a part ofthe ex-occipital bone. No. 2-'-, (Fig. 9). At an curly period 

 of development in the snake and possibly in all re])ti!ia, this |)art of 

 the ex-occipital exists as a distinct bone, notwithstanding that in hitcr 

 life it may have coalesced to such an extent with the ex-occipital 

 that its original distinctness is entirely lost. If such be the case, 

 which is not at all improbable, tiieii that part of the ex-occijutal in 

 the alligator. No. 2-^-, (Fig. 9), entering into the formation of the in- 

 ternal ear-cliamber, should be regarded as the homologue of tlie ex- 

 ternal o'ccipital No. 4, (Fig. lOj, in the turtle. The only essential

difference in the two would then be that in the alligator the external 

 occipital coalesces with the ex-occipital, whereas in the turtle it re- 

 mains a distinct bone throughout life. It will be observed, how- 

 ever, whether the osseous part in question be regarded as an out- 

 growth of the ex-occipital or as a distinct bone coalescing with the lat- 

 ter, that in neither case would the name opisthotic be appropriate, 

 since this bone or part, being homologous with the external occipital, 

 should be so named. 



It has alreadv been mentioned that that part of the supra- occipital 

 entering into the formation of the ear-chamber is said to be developed 

 from a special centre of ossification, No. 8 + (Fig. 9), and in accordance 

 \sith the idea of it being the homologue of the epiotic centre of the 

 human mastoid, named the epiotic. As there is no reason, however, 

 for supposing that such a third centre of ossification exists, even if the 

 part in question be characteristic of reptiles, the name epiotic should 

 be discarded because it is misleading. Finally, as the author regards 

 the bone No. 6, (Figs, ti, 7, 9, 10), not as the prootic but as the homo- 

 logue of the alisphenoid in ]\Ian, (Figs. 1, 2, a), there is no reason for 

 retaining the names prootic, opisthotic and epiotic.^* 



Indeed, the periotic bones, or bone so named, should not be regarded 

 as constituting any part of the proper cranial wall but as special 

 ossifications of the ear-chamber depending upon the extent of the 

 development of the organ of hearing. 



In a general way it may be said that the transitory conditions 

 through which the human ear passes in the coui-se of its develop- 

 ment are more or less permanently retained as such in the oi-gau 

 of hearing in the lower vertebrata. Such being the case we cannot 

 expect to find the protective osseous covering of the ear in the higher 

 vertebrata equally well developed in the lower ones. On the con- 

 trary, in profwrtion as the ear is undeveloped, we may expect to 

 find any of the adjacent bones forming the wall of the cranium pro- 

 tecting and entering into the formation of the ear-chamber, just as the 

 tym|)anum is formed in birds by the basisphenoid, squamosal and 

 ex-occipital rather than by the pai-s petrosa as in Man. There is no 

 more reason for supposing that there is an archetypal temporal bone, 



^•Tlu- aiithov does not refer to the skulls of birds, since the latter being 

 speeialized iciitilis the disposition of the parts in question, as niiglit be expected, 

 is essentially tlie sjtHie. 



It should be nientioued, however, that the meuihrana tynipani is not attach- 

 ed in birds to the (juadrate bone as in reptiles but to the outer margin ofthetym- 

 pauuiu. 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 51 



the different parts of wliicli must exist in all vertehrata, than for 

 believinp- that there is an archetypal vertebra and that the skull 

 must consist of several of the same, at least in a Goethe-Oken sense. 



It does not follow, however, because a difference ot opinion may 

 prevail among morphologists as to the special homologies of cei'tain 

 of the bones of the head that there should be any question as to the 

 truth of the general doctrine of the unity of organization of the skull, 

 so firmly established by Cuvier and others. 



On the supposition that the higher vertehrata have descended from 

 the lower, it is to be expected that the general structure of the 

 skull should be the same in both, the fundamental characters of the 

 skull of the former having been acquired by inheritance from that 

 of the latter. On the other hand, the skull should present greater or 

 less modifications according to the special nature of the different 

 vertehrata, such modifications being induced by the causes of varia- 

 tion incidental to different kinds of life. 



The skull, like the organism in general, is not made according to 

 a Platonic idea or pattern, but grows, its characteiv being acquired 

 by inheritance as modified by variation.

There are :i|)])le trees which have occasionally apetalou.-^ tlowers 

 and bear fruit whieh is, as popularly stated, corelesa. The pre- 

 cise morphology of this condition has never been explained. Ue- 

 ceutly some specimens were presented to the Academy by Mr. 

 Anchutz of Arch Street, Philadelphia, tVom a tree growing on the 

 grounds of Captain F. J. Williams, in PleasantsCo., West Virginia. 

 Though bearing fruit abundantly every year it never had been 

 known to have a '* blossom," that is to say, petals. The corrugated 

 a})pearance of the apex of the apple suggested the course of 

 growth which results in the "navel" varieties of orange, explained 

 iu Proceedings of the Academy, July 25, 1898, \\ 2!>2, 

 and an examination showed that a similar explanation applies 

 to the apple as well as the orange. The ordinary a|)ple is 

 simply an arrested branch in which the leaves, with the axis, 

 have been transformed into the succulent or carpellary structures 



Via. 1. Fig 2. 



which go to make up the fruit. But in these coreless apples, the 

 growth- wave resulting in the production of fruit did not become so 

 fully arrested, but made a renewed though weaker rhythm. This 

 was sufficient to draw nutrition from the original fruiting wave, and 

 perhaps interfere with its proper pollination, thus permitting the 

 toi-niatioH of an upper carpellary .system, — weak, certaiuly, but 

 sufficiently well situated to secure pollen and produce a h-w

very small seeds in tiie upper section. The illustrations explain the 

 process l)y which this coreless condition is brought about. Fig. 1 

 gives an external view of the apex of the apple. lu the ordinary 

 apple we havs the dry remains of five small sepals: in this we have 

 three series of five, alternating with each other in a perfectly normal 

 manner. The interior scries of five are quite fleshy and, as they 

 are evidently the ajucal portions of the five sectional protuberances 

 in the apple, we may safely conclude that it is this series which has 

 chiefly aided in the development of the fleshy portion of the fruit. 

 It should have been the matrix of the petals in the normal apple, 

 and we may infer that in this fruit, as we generally have it, with the 

 calycine and pctaliferous verticils combined, it is the inner or petal 

 bearing series that gives the apple its chief succulency. In the nor- 

 mal apple, the carpellary structure commences at a. Fig. 2, but in 

 this case, by the inij)erfectly arrested growth of the axis, it has 

 been carried up to b, — and even then not wholly brought to rest, as it 

 has made another step, c resulting finally in a small system capable at 

 least of seed-bearing, though having lost most of its power to give 

 succulence to its calycine series. We may say that a coreless apple 

 is, morphologically speaking, but a restless attempt on the part of the 

 tree, to develop several carpellary systems, instead of confining itself 

 to the perfection of one, as in ordinary cases. 



This phenomen is not unusual in plants. The rose, a near rela- 

 tive of the apple, is not infrecpieutly seen with another small rose 

 growing from its centre, the explanation being of the same charac- 

 ter as here given for the apple. 



It may be tersely stated that navel oranges and coreless apples are 

 feeble attempts at proliferation. 



The Relations Between Insec-ts and tiik Flowers of 



iMrAIIICNS Fli.VA. 



Along a small stream on my grounds, ma.s.»es of [mpntiens fttlva 

 abound, growing in great luxuriance. The humming bird, visits the 

 flowers as freely as various insects. I frequently amuse myself by 

 standing perfectly still in the midst of a mass of flowers, and have 

 these little creatures rest on my shoulder or even on my hand when 

 I kept it still above the flowers. AVhile thus enjoying myself, I 

 have been led to note many items of interest worth recording. 



Variations in species are often referred to the visits of insects. 




1894.] NATrRAI. SCIENCKS OF I'lIII.ADELPHIA. 55 



They bring polleu from other tlowers, and interinediate forms neces- 

 sarily rer^ult. Quite early in the modern discus^sions of this subject' 

 I showed that variation must first occur, and that the insect visitor was 

 rather a conservative agent than a faetor in variation, — bringing back 

 towards the original that which had departed. I have published 

 many papers showing that variation is at least as gi'eat in monotypic 

 species as where there are numerous closely related si»ecies or varie- 

 ties to cross with. Iiiipatiens fidva is another illustration. It is not 

 necessary to recount the character of the variations. One may 

 fairly say that no one character can be named that does not show 

 variation in some individuals. Even the glaucous leaves are some- 

 times bright green, at others almost silvery. The flowers not only 

 vary in color and markings, but the several parts of the flowers are 

 changeable. The spur particularly is sometimes of remarkable 

 length, at otliers well warranting the remark of Dr. Gray "spur 

 rarely wanting." Aside from the fact that there is no other species 

 near to get anv aid to variatiou in that way, many of the 

 colonies on my grounds are from last years' seecFs. The obser- 

 vations on this plant confirm records I have made during the past 

 quarter of a century that there is an innate power to vary co-existant 

 with the species itself, independent of any conditions of environment. 

 This may be granted without prejudice to the proposition that 

 changes can and do occur at times by the influence of environujeut, 

 for which there is abundant evidence. It seems proper to present 

 the strong facts on the former side, because of the modern tendency 

 to exalt the latter as the prime motor in evolution. 



The amount of nectar secreted at the base of the spur is consider- 

 able. By cutting ott' the apex and stripping down the tube as in 

 milking, a globule as large as a pin's head will form at tiie cut. A 

 large proportion of flowers, especially in the latter part of the season, 

 are deistogene. But even in these cleistogamous flowers si)urs are 

 formed. An interesting fact was that the nectar formed as 

 freely in the spurs of the deistogene flowers as in tho.se which we 

 should call normal and fully "adapted" to insect visitors! 



Is tliere any necessary relation between the nectariferous 

 structures of flowers and the visits of insects? The cases in which 

 the relationship appears close are numerous, but ef]ually numerous

are the cases on tlie other side, and this cleistogamous case is one. 

 Hut in t\w uoniial tiowers only a few insects could work to advantage. 

 The spur of tlie nectary is incurved, and only creatures with a long 

 and riexilde tongue could reach the sweet deposits stored, mostly, at 

 the base of the tube. In my "Flowers and Ferns of the United 

 States" (Series II, p. 44, 1880) Prof. W. W. Bailey is quoted on 

 the authoritv of a friend of his that "the sacs were all perforated by 

 bundile bees." Numerous species have their sacs perforated in 

 tliis way, and all have been charged, even by myself, to bumble 

 bees. Dr. J. H. Schneck of Mount Carmel, Illinois, suggested to 

 me that this is probably a mistake, and that species of Xylocopa 

 ("carpenter- bees) and not Bombia^, are responsible for this act. 

 Watching tliese tiowers I found the slits were made by a wasp, Vespa 

 maciilufu, that some species of Xylocopa, and also the honey bee, 

 took advantage of the work of the wasp; but the only species of 

 bund)le bee I noticed working on the flowers, Bombi(s Petuisi/lvani- 

 ciis, entered the flower every time by the flower's mouth, and got 

 the nectar from the curved spurs as best it could. Properly speak- 

 ing, the openings made by the hornet are notsliti?, but rough openings, 

 chewed out. The slits proper appeared to have been made by the 

 small carpenter bees. It is evident that in view of the many insects 

 these flowers support, no advantage is received bv the flowers in 

 return. 



The relation of Bombic^ to fertilization was next examined. 

 Tiie longitudinal streak of white pollen on the back of the visiting 

 bee gave it a picturesque appearance. That he could carry pollen 

 from one flower to the other was very apparent. It seems impossible 

 for the visiting bee to reach the stigma, as these are protected by con- 

 nivent scales under the anthers, which form a close cap covering the 

 stigma. Usually the earlier petaliferous flowers are infertile. In 

 these plants, early in August, numerous flowers had perfected fruit, 

 though the great majority were infertile. In what manner did the 

 bee or the hununing bird aid in the ))oIlination? Examining a num- 

 ber of flowers after these creatures had retired I was satisfied that 

 they did not aid in any way. I have had evidence in other cases 

 that where suflicient moisture exists, pollen tubes can reach the 

 stigma without actual contact with it. There is abundant moisture 

 around the stigma, and it is not inqiroljable that the pollen tubes, 

 by the aid of this moisture, pass over the membranous border, in 




1894.] NATl'KAI. SClENCliS OF IMII [.ADKI^IMII A . 57 



inuiiy cases, to reach the stigma aud ettect fertilization. The 

 positive fact gained by these observations is that neither liunnning 

 birds nor bumble bees in any way aid in pollenizing the petal-bear- 

 ing flowers. They are as absolutely self-fertile as the apetalous 

 cleistogene ones. 



An especially interesting observation was the existence of many 

 [ilants bearing wholly cleistogene flowers among the normal petal- 

 bearing ones. These plants were not as tall or vigorous as the petal- 

 bearers, and could be readily distinguished from a distance by a 

 yellowish-greeu tint, indicative of imperfect nutrition. It had been 

 before suggested to me by an incidental remark of ]Mr. Willis in the 

 Proceedings of the Cambridge (England) Philosophical Society, that 

 in some unexplained way there is a relation between im|)erfect nutri- 

 tion and cleistogamy, — a point which this observation confirms. 



The sum of these observations is, that in Impaiiens /(dm \i\ni\t\oii 

 is innate and not dependent on environment; that bright color and 

 sweet secretions have no relation to the visits of in.sccts; that the 

 petal-bearing flowers are self-fertile, and that cleistogamy is the 

 result of impaired nutrition rather than of any mere labor-saving 

 influence. 



Al'ETAJ.ISM AND SKi;i> PliOPUI^SION IN La.MUAI Fl Kl'lKKlM. 



Lnmitnn piirjnireiim, a well-known European species, is some- 

 what common as a wecil on my grounds at Germantown, near 

 Philadelphia. It exists in two forms: one with small |)ak' lilac 

 flowers, the other with flowers more rosy and larger. Wiiile 

 examining the flowers with a lens to trace any diflerence 

 that might exist, I was surprised to have my lace peppered 

 l)y the seeds which had been expelled from the calyx with consider- 

 Ml)le force. Examining [)lants with an abundance of r^vknX vessels, 

 it was seen that most of the caliw's were empty though still compara- 

 tively erect. The seeds, or piopn-ly nutlets, could not easily have 

 fallen out, an<l doubtless propulsion is the usual method by which 

 they are distributed. 



Examining i)lants in the early part of July I found large numbers 

 oftheupi)er flowers apetalous. The calyx was perfect, the stanwns 

 were of the usual length, and the anthers profusely hidtii with pol- 

 len ; the pistil seemed in every respect perfect, but not the 

 slightest trace of corolla existed. The stamens, normally borue ou the 

 5

coiollii, were uow wholly independent of eacli other, and hypogyn- 

 ous. This is pi-obahly the first case of apetalism recorded in 

 Labiatte. 



Fruiting of Robinia hispida. 



In descriptions of Robiniu. hlspida, no reference is made to 

 the legumes. In cultivation they are not known ever to be 

 formed. The writer lias searched for them in his botanical collect- 

 ings in Tennessee without finding any, and it is a general belief that 

 they are rarely produced when the plant is growing either in a wild 

 or cultivated state. Mr. David F. Day of Buffalo, New York, 

 notices "' that the anthers are destitute of pollen in the flowers he ex- 

 amined from cultivati'd plants iu that region, a condition often 

 found, in most plants of Laflu/nis (jtandijiorus and some 

 other Leguminose plants. In an excursion around Linville, North 

 Carolina, in July 18!>:), Mr. C. F. Saunders of Philadelphia found a 

 number fruiting, some specimens of which have been deposited in the 

 Herbarium of tlie Academy, and in the Royal Herbarium at Kew. 



Tin: Vitality ov Seeds. 



Antirrhinum (/Uiudulof^nm. Exact facts in regard to the })ower of 

 seeds short-lived under ordinary circumstances to retain vitality 

 when deeply imbedded in the earth, or under some other specific 

 ei^iiditions, are not numerous. Hence many controversies occur be- 

 tween the " practical man" who ^-uou'.s- they will live an indefinite 

 time, and the man of " science," who as firmly believes they will not. 

 The writer of tiiis has frequently been among the doubting ones, 

 simply because the facts adduced for long vital power, could bear 

 other interpretations. Ten years ago his friend, the late Dr. C. C. 

 Parry, gave him some California seeds. Antirrhinum (jlmdahmim 

 was raised from them. The following year the plot was required for 

 buildings aud covered with earth from the cellar several feet deep. 

 No plant of it has, to a certainty, been there since until this season, 

 when, the earth in one spot being turned up a few^feet in depth, one 

 plant came up and flowered.

Some European works have noted a mixture of species, or marked 

 varieties, of this plant in a wild state. Tlu' dimorphic character is 

 the probahle explanation.

Apetalism is not common in Criiclfene. 1 have noted tendency in 

 this direction in C<il:lle and in Jiaplianns. Early in the present sea- 

 son 1898 the plant being a connnon weed in my garden, I found 

 apetalous flowers verv common. Numerous instances of flowers with 

 only one, two or three petals, were also observed. Later in the season 

 there was seldom found any variation from the normal condition. 

 No difference in strength, position, or any other condition could l)e 

 observed that would satisfactorily account for the altortion.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE GEOLOGY OF ADJACENT PARTS OF OKLA-

nv K. D. con:. 



Through the co(">|)eratioii of certain inenihers of the Academy I 

 was enaliled to make an ex|)e(lition in the interest of vertebrate pale- 

 ontology during the summer of 181)8. The gentlemen who contribu- 

 ted the means for this exploration were Mr. Charles Cramp, Gen. 

 Isaac; J. Wistar, Dr. Samuel Dixon, Mv. Thos. H. Savery and Mr. 

 William Sellei-s. I had the privilege of the society and assist- 

 ance of Prof. Amos P. Brown, in charge of the Department of Geology 

 and Mineralogy in the University of Pennsylvania. Theex])editioii 

 left Bismark, Dakota, July 10th, and completed its labor at Galena 

 in southwestern Mi.-Jsouri on September 4th. 



The month of July and thirteen days of August were occupied in 

 explorations iu the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux Re- 

 servations in North and South Dakota. Near Fort Yates, N. D. , 

 we examined the hills which are directly to the north of the fort 

 and extend northward. A\'e obtained from them several fo.«sils which 

 indicate their marine origin, and that they belong to the Fox Hills 

 e|)och of Meek and Hayden. Tiiese include sharks' teeth of the genera 

 (iaU'octrdd and Otodits, and a fragment of a probable Chimerid fish. 

 The bluff's of the eastern escarpment of the Laramie f<»rmation ex- 

 tend acro.ss the plain at a distance of twelve miles west of Fort Yates, 

 and these were explored without result, except the discovery of a 

 few fragments of Dinosauriaii bones. 



We made an expedition to the Laramie bluti's which border 

 Hump (!reek in the northern part of South Dakota. This stieam 

 ri.<es in North Dakota, and after a course of perhaps thirty miles it 

 flows iut(t the Ree (or (irand) River. Its valley is bounded by bad 

 land bluffs, but in only one portion of these did we find vertebrate 

 fossils. I owe my knowledge of this locality, as well as that which 

 I had previously visitc^d in 1S92, to Mi.<s Mary Collins, who has 

 spent much of her life as a missionary among the Sioux, and who has 

 the contidcuce of these people in a marke(l degree. One ol Miss 

 Collins' assistants, a Sioux named Maza ( Iron ), had observed the 

 fossils, and served aa my guide tluring both the expeditions which 1 




04 PROCEEDINiiS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



Iiiive iiuide to obtain thorn. As a trustwortliy, amiable, and help- 

 ful man Maza proved himself to be an invaluable adjunct to the 

 party. We returned from Hump Creek on August 2d, and on the 

 way to the fort examined the escarpment of the Laramie at a point 

 further south than previously, and had greater success in obtaining 

 fossils. Altogether we obtained in the Laramie, bones of three 

 species of fishes and twelve species of reptiles; but no mammals or 

 birds rewarded our search. 



Our next points of investigation were the Upper Permian bad 

 lands of the Cimarron in Oklahoma, and such other outcrops of the 

 formation south of that river as should promise favorable results of 

 exploration. On our way thither we found ourselves, on August 10th, 

 at Sioux City, Iowa. Here we were courteously entertained bv ^Ir. 

 John H. ('harles. President of the Missouri River Transportation Com- 

 pany. He presented to the Academy portions of the vertebral 

 columes of two species of Plesiosauridio, from the Pierre formation 

 of the Upper Cretaceous, which were new to science, and which I 

 have described in the Proceedings of the American Philosophical 

 Society as Emhaphias circidosiis and Elasmomiirtts intermedins. On 

 an excursion along the bluffs bounding the valley of the Sioux river 

 we observed the eastern extension of the Niobrara Cretaceous lime- 

 stone and chalk, and the superimposed loess. 



In the absence of a good point for fitting out an expedition for the 

 explorations on the Cimarron River, we went to Fort Supply, a con- 

 siderable distance to the southward of it. We were there entertained 

 by tile officers of the prist, especially by Captain William Ahman 

 and by Lieut. Fox. The officer in command. Col. Daingerfield 

 Parker, very kindly gave us the use of the post ambulance, and by 

 this means we were enabled to make a pretty complete examination 

 of the neighborhood during the days of our sojourn. Our first object 

 wa.s to examine the red bluffs of Permian or Trias, wliich bound the 

 canyons N. and N. W. of the post, which form jiart of the drainage 

 system of the Cimarron. These bluffs we examined at various points 

 and for considerable distances, but without obtaining any traces of 

 fo.«sil remains, excepting some fragments of wood. We found that 

 tlie formation which constitutes the higher levels at the heads of the 

 canyons tributary to the Cimarron, is an impure friable calcareous 

 limestone of evidently lower cretaceous age. We olitained from it 

 Kruiji/m ie.roim and (iniphtia pitoherii with other species, which have

been determined by Prof. Brown as follows: — Kxofjijra fexioia, 

 Gnjplimi pifcherii, Ostrea suhomta, Ostrea ferenalimargo, Ostrea 

 sp., Caculla'a terminali.^, Neithea occlde))talis, Plicatula incomjrua, 

 Trlgonia sp., Trujonia emoryi, Tarrliella xeriatimgranulata, Schhrii- 

 Ihieliia peruvidiia. 



We found also the following vcrtcibrata: Lamiia No. 1, Lamiia 

 No. 2, Lepidotid scale, Uranoplosiis arctatus, U. fledideiis, Coelo- 

 (liiK broiviiii, Pleslosaiirii.t vertebrae, crocodile frairnients, and frag- 

 ments of a tortoise. 



The three species of Pycnodont fishes were new to science, and 

 they have a Lower Cretaceous facies. Plf'!<iosiiitnis is rei)resented 

 l)y dorsal vertebrae only, but these are not of the Upper Cretaceous 

 tyi^e. I have never found Lepidotid fish remains in the Upper Cre- 

 taceous of North America, while they are characteristically Lower 

 Cretaceous and Jurassic in Europe. The only occurrence of I-.epi- 

 dotid fishes so far recognized in N. America, is based on some teeth 

 sent by Mr. Charles H. Sternberg in the Dakota sandstone of Kan- 

 sas, and on the new species, Mdcrepisfins arcnatus, from tlie Trinity 

 bed of Texas discovered by Prof. R. T. Hill. (See Journal of (lie 

 Academy Vol. IX, Part 4). The crocodilian remains are unde- 

 terminable. 



Below this formation, which is of a strong yellow color and about 

 twenty-four feet tliick, is a stratum of marls, black a])()ve, whitish in 

 the nnddle, and butl' below, of about equal thi(tkiiess with the lime- 

 stone. The black color is due to carbon, which is some places forms 

 I bin layers of impure coal. This formation contained no fossils by 

 uhicii its age could be determined, and thus stood in strong contrast 

 with the cretaceous al)ov(' it, and agreed with the I(m1 beds of the 

 I'crmian below it. Between the black marl and the cretaceous there 

 intervened at some points a shallow bed of sand, usually coarse, an<l 

 reaching in places a thickness of six fi-et. Its color is yellow, varied 

 with horizontal red streaks. The age of the marine Cri-tacedus beds 

 r-orresponds, according to Prof Brown's determination, wilh the 

 Comanche Peak terranc of the Texas geologists. The had first ob- 

 served lies about five miles northwest of Fort Supply, and is of 

 limited Extent, being cut off (o the north by the drainage of ihe 

 ('imaiTon River, and to tlicsoiitii by the drainage of ihe Norlh I'ork 

 ot the Canadian. Its horizontal extent caimol exceed lifly sipiare 

 miles. We examined another and more limited area of the 




06 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



same l)e(l which contained the same invertebrate fossils, at a point 

 ahont twelve miles south of the fort. 



The Permian red beds are traversed conformaldy by layers of 

 gypsum at different horizons. The sand bed below the cretaceous 

 limestone ir* sometimes consolidated into a sandstone, which foi*ms a 

 ledge near the summit of the bluffs. From fifty to seventy-five feet 

 below this and in the red beds, is a bed of saccharoidal limestone. 

 This limestone is luminous when struck or scratched with a metallic 

 obje("t, like a similar limestone which occurs in some of the silver 

 mines in Utah in the Wasatch Mountains. 



At tiie locality already referred to, twelve miles south of Fort 

 .Sup})ly on a low ridge of the Cretaceous terrane, we observed a white 

 discoloration, as though two or three cartloads of a chalky material 

 had been deposited there. Prof. Brown was so fortunate as to find 

 in it the fragments of a solitary superior molar tooth of Proto- 

 hippus perditns, which determined the age of the material as the 

 Lou|) Fork, or Upper INTiocene. Careful search failed to reveal 

 another fossil, and it is evident that we have here the last remnants 

 of a formation which har^ been almost entirely removed by erosion. 



With the view of further determining the extent of the Comanche 

 and Loup Fork formations, we left Fort Supply antl went by rail to 

 Miami, whicli is a village in Roberts County of the Panhandle of 

 Texas, south of the Canadian river. For several miles before reach- 

 ing Miami, the railroad runs l)etween steep bluffs, which form the 

 southern border of the flood plains of the Canadian river, and are 

 the escarpments of the outlying tracts and fingers of the Staked 

 Plains. They are about two hundred feet in elevation, and include 

 two hard strata, while the great mass is sandy clay, or sand in a few 

 localities. One of the indurated beds is at the summit of the bluffs, 

 forming the surface of the plain, and is about six feet in thickness. 

 The softer argillaceous bed below it varies from fifteen to fifty feet, 

 when the second impure sandstone is reached, which has a thi(;kness 

 of about eight feet. The one hundred and fifty feet below this is 

 friable, .so that the construction of the escarpment is such as to keep 

 it more or less perpendicular. The general ajjpearanceof the bluffs 

 is closely .similar to that of the Blanco beds at the typical locality 

 one hundred and fifty miles south, at the point where the Brazos 

 River issues from the Staked Plains in the Blanco Canyon. In order 

 to a.scertaiu whether this formation is the Blanco or the Loup Fork, 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADKr.PIIIA. 67 



which it resembles, we examined the bluffs for a day and a half 

 for fossils. They are rare in that reuiou, but I obtained on the sec- 

 ond day, teeth of both series of a horee, Eqiius ciunmiiiMii Cope, 

 which demonstrated at once that the age is the Blanco. Mr. Brown 

 found camel bones which approach in dimensions those of the Blanco 

 species, rather than those of the Loup Fork ; but the species could 

 not be identified. 



On the succeedino- day, we drove, thanks to Mr. R. T. Cole, of 

 Mobeetie, to the town of Mobeetie in Wheeler County, eighteen 

 miles S. E. of Miami. The route takes the traveler across a part of 

 the Staked Plains, and a considerable distance before Mobeetie is 

 reached, ravines belonging to the drainage system of the tributaries 

 of the Red River are passed. We examined a nund)er of these for 

 considerable distances without obtaining fossils. As we passed the 

 deserted h'ort Elliott, near to ^Mobeetie, I examined some sandy beds 

 like those of the Upper Blanco beds, and obtained additional tooth 

 fragments of Kqim^ cinHininstii and a second species of Eipnix proba- 

 l)ly E. ennjdijlux, and fragments of teeth and other boues of unde- 

 terminable camels. We thus determined the extension of the Blanco 

 l)ed as far east as Mobeetie. 



The result of my observations on this, the northeastern border of 

 the Staked Plains, is to the effect that this plateau to the north of the 

 Ked River like that part to the south of it, belongs to the Blanco <le- 

 posit, giving the latter a north and south extent of two hundred and 

 fifty miles. It had been hitherto positively determined at the typical 

 locality only, that distance south of Miami, on the upper waters of 

 the Brazos, From this point to the Red River the formation appears 

 to be continuous ; and the portion north of the Red River now 

 <lescribed, not onlv has a close physical resemblance to the portion 

 south of it, but contains as now ap})ears, fossils of the same age. 

 (See Report of the Geological Survey of Texas for 1892, for reports 

 by Cummins and Cope on the Blanco terrane). 



On our return from Texas, we sto|)ped at Tucker, Oklahoma, near 

 to the Cimarron River, and examined for a day the exposures and 

 l)ad lands of the Upper Permian of that region. Although the ex- 

 posures are most favorable for the exhibition of any fossils which the 

 strata may contain, nothing of organic origin wasfouml. Crystalli/od 

 gypsum is very abundant. 



On reaching Kansas on our return, we stopped at Wellington and 




68 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADli^MY OF [1894. 



examined the Plistocene sands of that locality. At the west side of 

 the town is an ahaudoned sand quarry, and on the east side is a simi- 

 lar quarry, from which the town derives its supply of building sand. 

 We obtained from a saloon a number of fossils which were said to 

 have liecn found several years previously in the west-side quarry. 

 These consist of an almost entire mandibular arch of an adult Ele- 

 jtlias primigenins with both molars in place, with several bones of 

 pr(»bai)ly the same animal ; together with the muzzle and parts of 

 both horns of a large bison, which diffei^s considerably from B. 

 hiUfronx, and to which I have given the name of Bos crampianns. 

 h is figured and described in the Journal of the Academy, Vol. IX, 

 Part 4. T also obtained from Mr. Wheeler, owner of the east-side 

 quarry, an entire posterior molar of Elephas primigeniii.'< of the coarse 

 |)late(l variety, which was taken from his pit. 



Hearing of remains of the Mammoth in possession of some one 

 near to Hennessy in Central Oklahoma, we took rail for that place. On 

 arriving, we found that the fragments were in possession of a randier 

 eight miles west of that town. We visited the ranch, and found that 

 the fragments were much l)roken, and included the four molar teeth 

 of an adult Ele)>haH prhnigenius of the coarse plated variety. The 

 rancher, Mr. Painter, had in his possession a number of teeth and 

 some ])onesof the liml)S of a saber-tooth tiger, which he had found 

 with those of the mammoth. Both its bones and those of the mam- 

 moth were stained red by the coloring iron of the Permian clay, 

 and were covered by a thin layer of it. The animals had been in 

 some way buried in this material during the Plistocene epoch. I 

 have described the cat under the name of Dinobastis serits in the 

 Journal of the Academy, Vol. IX, Part 4, as it represented both a 

 species and genus new to science. 



On our return northward we stopped a few days at Galena, Mis- 

 souri, and visited the Marble cave eighteen miles east of that place, 

 under the guidance of the proprieter, Mr. Truman Powell. I wish 

 here to ex])ress the obligatiim under which Mr. Powell placed me 

 through his hospitality and general assistance.

LIST OF PORT JACKSON CHITONS COLLECTED BY DR. J. C. COX, WITH A 

 REVISION OF AUSTRALIAN ACANTHOCHITIDJE. 



BY HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



The following pages coutain a part of the results of the studv of a 

 collection of the Chitons of Port Jackson, New South Wales, Australia, 

 recently made by Dr. J. C. Cox, the well-known Australian con- 

 chologist. Dr. Cox, with great liberality, transmitted to the 

 Academy a large number of specimens both dry and preserved in 

 spirits, with the request that they be studied and reported on. I am 

 therefore enabled to make a contribution toward an exact knowledge 

 of the distril)ution of the Polyplacophora inhabiting the New South 

 Wales coast, as well as to elucidate several important |)oints relating 

 to particular species and genera. 



With the exception of a few records by Mr. E. A. Smith, of Port 

 Jackson species collected by Coppinger,' and ])y Professor Haddon 

 of those collected by the "Challenger,"- our knowledge of the Chi- 

 ton fauna of the New South Wales coast is limited to the lists pub- 

 lished by Mr. G. F. Augas'' many years ago. At that time, the 

 morphology of Polyplacophora was very imperfectly understood ; 

 and consequently these adrairaljlc lists, which have been so helpful 

 to subsequent conchologists in dealing with most families of molliisks, 

 are almost useless in the study of Chitons, so many errors do they 

 contain. 



xVngas, however, found some forms in Port Jackson which sul)3e- 

 (juent observers have not yet found, and among them several, such 

 as Microplax Graiji, of exceptional interest to the general student 

 on account of their peculiar and ill-understood features. 



To direct the attention of local malacologists to these forms, if for no 

 other reason, it is thought expedient to quote Angus' list of species, 

 the modern equivalents of his iiiiincs, so far as known to me, l)eing 

 given in another column.

 Genus CALLOCHITON Gray. 

 Callochiton platessa (iinikl. 



Port Jackson. Thi?? is the Lepforliifoii ver.-<ieolor Ad., of Annas' 

 list. It is a lovely shell of the most brilliant oranye-reLl color. A 

 larger, dark-hrown species allied to this, occurs on the Tasiiianian 

 coast, Callochiton {Trachyradsia) inornaf us Ten.-Woods. 



Genus ISCHNOCHITON Gray. 



The ueneral arranuement of the species of this izenus is far from 

 satisfactoi'v. Former classifications have been founded too exclusivolv 

 upon theuirdle .scales. The Australian species fall into live natural 

 groups, or section,-^, which may he defined as follows: — 



1. Iscliiiorltitdn s. str: type loiigici/inba Q. tt G. 



Intermediate valves having 1—1 slits; lateral areas radiallv 

 sculptured, central areas finely granulated in i|uincunx, or 

 longitudinally lirulate at the sides, with "V" sculpture 

 along the ridge. Girdle scales subequal, striated. 



2. Stenochiton : type jaloides A. ct A. 



Animal much elongated: intermediate valves having .several 

 slits on each side, 

 o. Heferozoiia: type cariosa Cpr. 



Like hclnwi-liltoii ^sensu stricto), hut girdle scales minute and 

 large, intermingled. 



4. Hujilopla.r nov. : tvpe f^inartKjd'niiin iVng. 



Intermediati' valves haviiiLi' 1-1 slits; entire surface suioolh 

 except for minute granulation; girdle scales convex, smooth. 



5. Ischnoradsia : type aiist rails Sowb. 



Shell not unusually elongated; intermeiliate valves with 

 several side-slits, sculpture coar.se; girdle scales very convex, 

 not stiiated. 



Ischnofhitou Haddoni rilslny. 



Very abundant at Port Jackson and Port Hacking. This should 

 lie coni[)ared with the type of Chiton crisjuts lltievi", Conch. Icon. pi. 

 r», fig. 120, a species I have not seen. Also with (/. pnlliilits

Ischnochiton fruticosus (iM. 



Abundant at Fort Jackson, with the next species. This form is 

 distinguished from 7. dicergeuft by its very much smaller girdle 

 scales. lu fniticosi(-< the individual scales measure in width -25 

 mm., or four to a millimeter. In dit'erf/eiif! they measure '40, or 

 only two and a half to the millimeter. The difference is perfectly 

 obvious to the naked eye. 



This species and the next seem to have been included by Angas 

 under the name Lepidoplenrns pivfens. I believe CalllstocJiiton 

 Copplngerl Smith to be the young of this species. 



Ischnochiton diveigens JJccvc. 



Port Jackson and Port Hacking (Cox). Reeve's Cli. protens, 

 described i'vom Newcastle, is a synonym. 



IschnocMtoa ilschnoradsia) australis Sowh. 



Port Jackson (Cox). 



Ischnocliiton (Haploplax) smaragdinus Aiifjas. 



Port Jacks(m (Cox). This species varies wonderfully in colora- 

 tion. The following patterns being represented iu the lot before me: 

 ('/) white or ])ale olive, the front and hind valves black; sometimes 

 the fourth, fifth and seventh valves marked boldly with black, (h) 

 Pale olive, flecked closely with olive, head and tail valves black, 

 (c) Sky-blue, closely reticulated with olive, and iu places marked 

 with white, {d) Rich brown, speckled with olivaceous, and marked 

 with white on valves i, iv, viii. The details are thus endlessly 

 varied. Mi-. E. A. Smith has kindly verified my determination bv 

 a comparison with Angas type oi' 61111 nvjdiun-i. 



I. smaragdinus picturatus var. uov. 



Color-scheme consisting of a wide (/o/>a/ KfrljH' of lilae, tiark blue, 

 ochre or some combination of these or other hues: tlir 4ripe bordered 

 with broiviil.fh, ikis border spreadiii(j fonv ird on ralre i, (nid !<pread- 

 iiifj over mod of rnlrcs ii and vi. Remainder of the side-slopes light 

 and variegated. Girdle irregularly tessellated. 



This seems so well defined a pattern of coloring that 1 venture to 

 give it a name. Many specimens are before me from Port Jack-sou. 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OK PHI r-ADELPHIA. 73 



Ischnocliiton (Haploplax) lentiginosus Suwb. 



Shell rather thiu, oval, moderately elevated, carinated. the side- 

 slopes straight. Surface smooth except for slight radial riblets ou 

 the lateral areas. Ground-color orange, orange-brown, or even with 

 an olive suffusion, coarsely spotted throiighoid with bright blue; the 

 girdle olive-green, uuicolored or with dusky bars. 



The intermediate valves are slightly concave behind, tlie beaks 

 slightly projecting and interrupting the curve. Lateral areas slightly 

 raised, marked by 4 to 6 weak, low radial riblets, obsolete in some 

 specimens. Central areas having slight growth lines, but otherwise 

 unsculptured except for the usual microscopic granulation of the whole 

 surface. End valves showing traces of radial riblets toward the 

 periphery. Posterior valve having the rather blunt mucro at the 

 sununit of the straight posterior slope, and in front of the middle. 



Interior roseate in the cavity, olivaceous behind the valve-callus, 

 the sutural and insertion- plates blue-white. Sutural-larainte short, 

 projecting less than half the length of a valve, separated by a rather 

 narrow, hardly squared, sinus. Anterior valve having 11, inter- 

 mediate valves 1-1, posterior 13 slits; teeth sharp, normal. 



Girdle clothed with densely imbricating convex, polished scales, 

 which generally show a very minute striation under the compound 

 microscope. The scales measure: width -28, alt. about '22 mm. ; 

 the width of a scale is therefore contained about 3] times in a milli- 

 meter. 



Length 19, breadtli 10 jum.; divergence about 115°. 



This species was described from Newcastle, N. S. Wales. It has 

 since been confused with /. ajaneopunctidus Krauss, a very similar 

 species from the Cape ; and its Australian habitat has been doubted. 

 The rediscovery of the species in Australia (Port Hacking, N. S. 

 Wales) by Dr. Cox is therefore of unusual interest. 



In some specimens there is a narrow whitish stripe on the ridge of 

 valves iii, iv, v, vii and viii; and in some the blue spots become en- 

 larged and diluted on valve iv, forming a pale blue or whitish varie- 

 -;ation. 



This cannot be CliHon rbjpt us j^lainv. (Diet. Sci. Nat., .xxxvi, p.

sculpture of the valves, whicli is not paralleled by any other small 

 Chiton of Australian waters. 



Another species referred to this genus, Callisiochiton ('opjnngeriK. 

 A. Smith, has been described from Port Jackson. I have not seen 

 the type, but I believe it to be a youufr, roughly sculptured Isch- 

 nockiton fndicosus Gld. 



Family MOPALIIDiEI. 

 Genus PLAXIPHOEA Gray. 

 Plaxiphora petholata Sowh. 



Abundant and typical at Port Jackson and Port Hacking. At 

 the latter locality some specimens occurred having the exterior colored 

 like P. r/hdca Quoy (Man. Couch., XIV, pi. 68, fig. 72), and 

 the inside pink and white, slightly clouded with 1)1 ue. I have not 

 seen specimens of the true P. glaiici, which is described as smooth 

 outside. The valves of P. petholata are always finely corrugated. 



Family ACANTHOCHITID^. 



But one genus of this family, Aeauthochites, has been found to 

 have representatives in Australian waters. This genus is nearly 

 world-wide in distribution in tropical and temperate seas. The other 

 genera of the family are local in distribution, and contain very few 

 species. 



Genus ACANTHOCHITES Risso. 



The genus Amnfhochites is one of the most difficult groujis ot 

 Chitons, partly on account of the insufficiency of the |)ublished 

 descriptions of species, ])artly because the specific characters are not 

 easy to see in the creatures themselves, especially if the external 

 features only of the animal are studied. 



When the valves are removed from the girdle, a number of ex- 

 cellent distinguishing characters are seen, enabling us to reach more 

 satisfactory conclusions in most cases. 



The characters to l>e especially observed are : — 



1. General form, etc., features of girdle, its tufts, and presence or 

 absence of a marginal fringe of longer spicules. 



2. General features and coloring of valves; .'<h'tpe of their posterior 

 (sut'iral) viari/ii)s, which may be either concave, or cimvex and 

 strongly imbricating. 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHIJ.ADKLPHIA. 75 



3. Degree of differentiation of dorsal areas, which may he either 

 raised at the edges, or contiuuous with the side areas, and either 

 transversely or longitndinalli/ striated. Sculpture of side-areas, and 

 shape of the pustules, which may be either convex or concave. 



The preceding features may be observed without disarticulating 

 the specimen; the following require its dissection, which is easy 

 enough after soaking it in warm water. 



4. Shape of tegmentum of fail valve, proportion of its breadth to 

 length, and position of mucro. 



5. Shape of posterior insertion-plate of tail valve, wliich mav be 

 either regularly rounded or angular. Number of slits. 



6. Length of front slope of tegmentum of head valve as compared 

 with length from apex to edge of front teeth of same. 



The last mentioned character is a good index to the degree of im- 

 mersion of the valves in the girdle. Of course, any of these charac- 

 tei'S is subject to individual variation, but if a description is prepared 

 noticing them all, it is extremely likely to contain something which 

 will lead to the identification of a given specimen. In my account 

 of this genus in the Manual of Conchology, insufficient attention was 

 given to the features of the tail valve.

Of these seventeen species, the four described by de Blainville 

 have not been recognized, and without an examination of the types 

 thev cannot, in ray opinion, be really known. The three species 

 described by Dr. Rochebrune will also prove difficult to identif}', 

 although ^1. jxicnndux ^vill probably be recognized by its peculiar 

 coloration. ^lost of these species of Blainville and Rochebrune were 

 founded upon specimens collected in the early part of the century 

 and no locality more exact than "New Holland" is stated. It must 

 be remembered that even this vague geographical information is not 

 to be considered conclusive. Some early voyagers have been known 

 to get the localities of their shells mixed. 



The remaining species are known to be Australian; but two of 

 them, H. mrinatus and A. scntigtr, must be rejected ; the first be- 

 cause the name is preoccupied by Risso (Acanthochites (■arin(itH.< 

 Risso, Hist. Nat. Eur. :\Ierid., IV, p. 169. 1826), the other because 

 it is founded upon an incorrect identification. 



We have, therefore, eight recognizable species of Acanthorhites 

 from this region, if we include "Hanleya" vari(d)ilis which is un- 

 known to me autoptically. To this number, one more is herein 

 added. 



The Australian AcanthorJtites fall into four subgenera or sections, 

 distinguished by the following characters : 

 a. Anterior valve having five strong radiating ribs, lobing the 

 periphery of the tegmentum; tail valve with several slit*.

 having the insertion- plate about one-third as long as the front slope 

 of the tegmentum, witli 5 small slits. Intermediate valves having 

 vtry oblique })lates witli 1-1 minute posterior slits;" posterior valve

" 12, "6 " (average specimen preserved in alcohol ). 



Abundant in Port Jackson, near Sydney (Dr. J. C. Cox!). 



This is a very distinct and easily recognized little species, of which 

 Dr. Cox has collected great numbers. It varies interminably in the 

 color and pattern of the valves, but not much in sculpture. The 

 subgenus which I have constituted for the reception of this one species 

 may be defined as follows: 



Metiiroplu.v, n. subg. of Arnntliochites. Subg. Char.: A'alves i to 

 vii as in Aranthocldtes, hut dorsal areas indistinctly differen- 

 tiated; valve viii having the vmcro poderlor, tht ini^ertion-phde dronijlij 

 illrected Jorward, with one slit on each side, and no sinus behind. 

 Girdle as in Acunthochite^. Type A. retrojeetus. 



This group holds the same relation to AcanihocJiUix that I^allochi- 

 ton holds to Chidopleura. It is a variation distinctly in the direction 

 of the Crypfoplaculcv, recalling Choneplax, and clearly showing the 

 Acauthochitoid genesis of that family.

The })rominent features of this species are ( 1 ), that the dorsal ar- 

 eas are hardly differentiated, being only somewhat smoother than the 

 densely granulated latero-pleural areas, and totally lack longitudinal 

 striation. (2) The posterior margins of the median valves are [)ro- 

 duced fki- backward in the middle, each stnmgly ind)ricating over 

 the following valve, and inside the l)eak-margin is very broadly re- 

 He.\ed (fig. 16). (8) The tail valve is disproportionately small 

 (compare fig. 20 with fig. 17) and its sutural-lamin:e are very long.

These features, in corabinatioa with the compact, asbest us-like sutural 

 tufts, readily distinguish the species from other known forms. 



A. asbestoides was collected by Coppinger at Port INIolle, Queens- 

 land, It is also in the British Museum from Flinder's Island, Bass 

 Strait. This last locality should be confirmed.

Shell elongated, the visible portion of the valves occupying 

 less than one- third of the entire breadth of the animal (when 

 preserved in alcohol). Valves grayish, somewhat mottled with 

 olive and fleshy, the dorsal areas dark red or marked with oli- 

 vaceous. Girdle olivaceous. 



Exposed portions of the intermediate valves subtriangular, slightly 

 elevated, hardly carinated, nearly separated at the sutures by spicu. 

 lose bridges of the girdle. Dorsal areas- wedge-shaped, convex, dis- 

 tinctly diff(n'entiated from the pleura but not elevated at the sides, 

 sculptured with fine longitudinal striae. Latere- pleural areas having 

 the diagonal rib indicated by a low rounded convexity, and sculptured 

 throughout with convex pustules elongated in a radial direction 

 (fig. 21). Anterior valve having five low riblets indicated, each 

 produced at the lower edge in a slight lobe. Posterior valve (PI. 

 Ill, figs. 22-25) having the tegmentum subcircular, a trifle wider 

 than long, the mucro rather elevated and acute, behind the middle. 



Interior rose colored. Anterior valve with the insertion-plate 

 more than half as long as the front slope of tegmentum, pink, with 

 five deep slits; intermediate valves having 1-1 slits, and a ridge 

 running upward from the slits, as though the anterior edge of the 

 posterior tooth projected over the posterior edge of the anterior tooth. 

 Posterior valve having the insertion-plate subvertical behind, and 

 slightly waved up between the two slits; its posterior contour convex. 

 Sutural laminte large, roimded; sinus angular. 



Girdle fleshy, densely clothed with short hyaline spinelets, the 

 tufts being represented Ijy inconspicuous clumps of somewhat longer 

 spines.

Intermediate valves having the exposed portions broadly wedge- 

 shaped, truncated in front, decidedly imbricating. Dorsal area of each 

 valve wedge-shaped, rather wide, convex, distinctly differentiated 

 from the pleural areas, but not raised at the sides, sculptured with 

 numerous rather weak longitudinal stride and crossed by slight 

 growth-lines. Latero- pleural areas having no trace of a diagonal

Straight. Color of valves light creamy-gray, sparsely maculated 

 with dingy hrowu and white, usually showing some indistinct olive 

 stains on some valves. Girdle gray, with conspicuous silky, silvery 

 tufts. 



The posterioi- ( sutural ) margins of the valves are nearly straiglit, 

 the small beaks slightly projecting along the middle line. The teg- 

 mentum of each intermediate valve is divided into a distinct but not 

 shai-ply defined triangular dorsal area, which is longitudinally 

 marked by 15-20 deeply cut strue, and twosubequilateral triangular 

 side areas, which bear concave or flat topped ovate pustules, rather 

 irregularly arranged. The anterior valve is similarly sculptured; 

 and has several indistinct radial elevations; the front slope of its teg- 

 mentum is nearly double the lengtli of the anterior teeth. The pos- 

 terior valve has a rounded-hexagonal tegmentum which is somewhat 

 broader tlian long, with the mucro between the posterior third and 

 fourth of its length; behind the mucro sloping outwai'd. 



Interior tinged with rose in the middle andsomewhat porous there, 

 the teeth and sutural plates bluish or greenish; valve-callus strong; 

 reflexed border of tegmentum very narrow. Anterior valve with 

 five, intermediate valves 1-1 slits; posterior valve (PI. II, figs.

 terior median portion straight, latero- posterior sides concave behind 

 the two narrow slits. Sinus wide and angular in all the valves. 



Girdle wide, densely clothed with short, gray-brown spicules, and 

 having nine large tufts of long, silvery spicules on each side. 



Length about 13, breadth 6] mm. (dried specimen). 



Habitat: Western Shore of .St. Vincent Gulf, S. Australia ( W.

This species is closely allied to .1. (jranostriatiis, but the valves 

 are more solid; the dorsal areas are much more deepli/ striated lonyl-

 sutural laminic in A. bcdnalU are greenish; the pustules of the side- 

 areas are somewhat larger and rather less regularly arranged in 

 longitudinal series. The profile of valve viii is not notably different 

 in the two species, but the mucro of A. gnmo-^tr'udiis is rather more

This peculiar species may instantly he known hy the wide, Cry])to- 

 plax-like girdle, densely clothed witli minute spines wliich are thick 

 and blunt tor an AcitnfliorJi'dex, and having inconspicuous sutural 

 tufts, not longer than the surrounding pile, but composed of finer, 

 whiter spicules. The tegmentum of each intermediate valve is tri- 

 angular, the girdle tissue forming spiculose bridges at the sutures. 

 The dorsal areas are sharply defined, convex, and arcuately striated 

 by growth- lines, but show no longitudinal stritc. The latem-pleu- 

 ral areas have round concave-top})ed pustules. Other notable fea- 

 tures are found in the tail- valve, which is very high, with vertical 

 posterior m.sei'tion-plate, and pear-shaped tegmentum. The sutural 

 laminie and insertion-plates are radially striated, and the posterior 

 valve has several slits, besides the usual pair. The tegmentum of 

 the head- valve is small, extending hardly half the length of the front 

 slope of the valve. The figures ai'e drawn from a specimen from 

 St. Vincent Gulf; furnished by Mr. W. T. Bednall. It luis been

The sculpture of this species is extremely peculiar, and totally dif- 

 ferent from that of any previously known member of the family 

 Acanthochitidte. The coloring is also markedly distinct. The type 

 was sent me by Mr. W. T. Bednall of Adelaide, South Australia, 

 who suggested the specific name employed above. Although techni- 

 cally a Xotoplax in its multifissate tail valve, this species is very un- 

 like A. speriosK.-i, the type of that group.

The above translation of the original description is given for com- 

 parison with that of A. MattliewHl. This species is otherwise un- 

 known to me, and may prove to belong to some other group. It is 

 evidently distinct from A. Mottheivsi, the proportions of breadth to 

 length in the two being so diflerent as to preclude the suspicion of 

 identity which I at first entertained.

Chiton muricatus A. A<1 



The central areas have a ribless triangle in the middle; the pleura 

 have about 10 narrow riblets on each side in front of the diagonal 

 rib, but not extending forward to the anterior margin of the valv(>. 

 The most prominent feature of this species is the peculiar sharp- 

 pointed girdle scales, a character unique in this genus. This species 

 was described from Sydney. Dr. Cox obtained specimens in Port

 The girdle scales are smaller than in a specimen of jugosus of the 

 same size; the grooves in front of the diagonal line are narrower, with 

 wider interspaces, etc. 



Genus LORICELLA Pilsbry. 



This name was proposed originally as a section of Lorica. At that 

 time I had seen no specimens of L. Angasi, its type. Several alco- 

 holic examples are now before me, showing features not before 

 noticed, which are undoubtedly of generic importance. The group 

 may be characterized as follows: 



Gen. char.: Valves entirely exposed, the front one very large, 

 having numerous unequal, conspicuously pectinated teeth: median 

 valves squared, having a narrow bi-lobed sinus, slits 1-1 ; posterior 

 valve small, with posterior mucro, the insertion- plate reduced to a 

 low ridge, nearly smooth and iuterru])ted l)y a slight sinus beiiind. 

 (Jirdle widest in front, having a small slit behind; densely covered 

 with minute elongated granules and hearing long, l)ranching bristles 

 arranged in radial series. 



In short, Luricella has the general features of Lorica, phix girdle

The hairs of the izirdle branch, somewhat as in Mopalia rlllafn. 

 There is no trace of eyes or eye-pits npon the valves; bnt the genns 

 has doubtless descended from a form having eyes, and its position in 

 the general system will not differ from that assigned in my mono-

TANAIS ROBUSTTJS. A NEW SPECIES OF ANISOPODA. 

 I5Y II. F. MOORE. 



lu August, 1892, the collectors of the Marine Biological Labora- 

 tory of the University of Pennsylvania, at Sea Isle City, N. J., 

 brought in a large logger- head turtle, Thalassochelys caretta. 



Examination showed its carapace to be burdened with a miscel- 

 laneous collection of invertebrata, including Polyzoa, Anellida, Cir- 

 ripedea, Pycnogonidia, Caprellidae and a single species of Auisopoda. 



The latter, which has apparently heretofore escaped notice, was 

 found in numbers inhabiting minute tubes in the crevices between 

 the scales of the turtle's carapace. When unmolested, these little 

 crustaceans could be seen crawling carefully about among their fel- 

 low voyagers or lying at the mouths of their domiciles with only the 

 head and chelje projecting ; when disturbed they promptly retreated 

 out of sight. I am unaware of any other species of the family 

 Tanaidie occupying a similar position. 



Though differing iu some slight particulars from the genus Tattais 

 as re-constituted by Sai*s, the sum of its charactei-s evidently places it 

 in that genus and I propose for it the name Tanais rohustus. 



It is quite robust for the family, being less than 3? times as long as 

 broad. The carapace, which is the broadest portion of the body, is 

 terminated anteriorly by a minute rostrum, whilst its posterior border 

 is somewhat concave in the middle line. Iu front of the origin of 

 the great gnathopods the lateral outline is strongly concave, but op- 

 posite the bases of these limbs it becomes swollen. When viewed 

 doi'sally, the carapace appears, in general figure, top-shaped. Two 

 grooves, one ou each side, indicate upon the dorsal surface the inner 

 boundary of the brancliial chamber. Behind the carapace the 

 breadth of the body becomes gradually less with each successive seg- 

 ment. The fourth free segment of the perieou is the longest, slightly 

 exceeding the third, which is in turn longer than the fifth. 



The pleon is composed of six distinct segments, of which the fourth 

 and fifth are much f^horter than the others and the sixth is terminated, 

 posteriorly, by a blunt median projection. The body is constricted 

 at the joints and the segmentation is distinctly marked. The dorsal 

 surface is furnished, laterally, with a few sette, which on the firet and 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHIIiADELPHIA. 91 



second segments of the pleon form a short row on each side, but 

 never form a transverse baud crossing the segment. 



The eyes and eye- lobes are large, the latter being let into deep re- 

 cesses in the anterior lateral portion of the carapace. 



The antennulse consist of three joints, of which the basal one is 

 somewhat longer than the other two combined. A small knob (rudi- 

 mentary flagellum) terminates each. In the male the antennuhy 

 usually about equal in length the carapace with the first free segment, 

 but are sometimes considerably longer. In the female they are about 

 equal to the carapace alone. 



The antennae lie close beneath the antennulte, by which they are 

 slightly exceeded in length in both male and female. They are five- 

 jointed, the fourth joint being the longest, slightly exceeding the sec- 

 ond; the fifth, third and first following in the order named, the last 

 mentioned being very short. Each antenna is terminated by a 

 densely setiferous rudimentary flagellum considerably longer than 

 that of the antennules and sometimes imperfectly articulated, 



The mandibles are of the usual form, curved inwards at the tip 

 whei'e each bears a pair of horny teeth, shaped like the limbs of the 

 letter U. Proximad of the middle, a stout transverse column passes 

 mediad bearing at its end an oval molar plate traversed by a series 

 of parallel ridges with deep grooves between. Under a high power 

 each ridge appears to be broken up by shallow indentations into a 

 sei'ies of rounded teeth. 



The first maxillae consist of a stout forwardly directed column 

 and a posteriorly directed palpus, bearing at its end a brush of 

 seven or eight long setse. The antei'ior ramus is stout and 

 curved towards the median line, bearing at its tip a group 

 ot about eight stout, curved spines, each with two series of fine, 

 apically directed, denticuli. A brush of stifi' setie lies near the base, 

 and laterad of, the spines, A smaller group of spines lie on one 

 face near the tip; these are not denticulate and lack the brown color 

 of those in the apical group. 



The maxillipeds are adherent basally by means of short, stout 

 hooks. Tlu! basal joints are prolonged on tlieir anterior or oral 

 aspects into phite-like processes, which are coupled together in the 

 median line. Eachbasal joint bears a ihittened palpus, consistingof four 

 joints, the terminal three being furnished witii long setic. The distal 

 joint is strongly flexed on the penultimate. A somewhat falciform

brauchial epipod is attached to the maxilliped at its base, by nieaus 

 of a slender stalk. 



The first gnathopods are strongly chelate in both sexes, but 

 especially so in the males. The "thumb" of the propodite is ter- 

 minated by a lioruy tooth and external to and just within this is a 

 sharp- edged tubercle; the tooth of the dactylopodite bites between 

 these two. Figs. 6 and 6a, Plate V, show the gnathopods of male 

 and female side by side and give a better idea of their appearance 

 than can be gained from a description. 



The limbs of the first free segment of the perseon are long 

 and slender, their terminal claws being but slightly curved. The 

 two succeeding pairs are stouter, with the dactylopodite and 

 claw shorter than in the first pair. The last three pairs are still 

 stouter, the dactylopodite bears a strongly hooked claw with a comb- 

 like series of minute curved teeth on each side and the distal end of 

 the pro})odite bears a row of stout setie. All the lind^s except those 

 of the first free segment have the distal end of the carpopodite crowned 

 with a few stout spines, some bifid, others serrulate. 



Only the anterior three segments of the pleon bear limbs (pleo- 

 pods). Each of these consists of a flat basal piece { proto})odite) to 

 which are attached two one-jointed blades furnished, on their outer 

 edges, with long pinnate setre, the exopodite bearing about 35, the 

 endopodite about 15. Both protopodite and endopodite bear a single 

 stout seta on their inner edge. 



The last segment bears a pair of four-jointed setose limbs (uro- 

 pods), the segments of which are cylindi-ical and increase in length 

 from base to tip. 



The marsupia of the female are thin walled pouches attached 

 to the ventral wall of the sixth thoracic segment (fourth free seg- 

 ment). They incretise in size with the development of the eggs and 

 in some specimens extend over segments five and seven, to which, 

 however, they are not attached. 



The largest specimens collected measure from rostrum to tip of 

 pleon 4*7 mm, and in width 1*4 ram. The ground color in alcoholic 

 specimens is pale yellow. Upon the carapace this is heavily mottled 

 with brownish pigment, excepting over about thirty elli|)tical and 

 sub-elliptical areohe symmetrically arranged towards the middle line. 

 The dorsal surfaces of the chehe arc similarly marked. The portion of

the body aud the limb.s behind the carapace are much paler, being 

 usually concealed in the tubular dwelling. 



Nine species of Tauaidse have been previously recorded from the 

 western shores of the North Atlantic, namely : 



Tanais vittatus Rathke. 



T. hirsiitvs Beddard. 



Leptorhelia Surigm/i Kroyer^(L. ahju-oJa Harger 9 ).

Leptofjnathia cceca (Harger) Sars. 



Neotanais americana Beddard. 



Tanais vittatus, L. Savignyt (f) and L. dubia (.^) have been taken 

 at Great Egg Harbor Bay, New Jersey. 



T. /(n*s(^/('S was dredged by the "Challenger" in 50 to 150

 fathoms about 200 miles southeast of New York. 



II. I'nnicoki, L. men and all the species of Leptorhelia enumerated 

 have been taken on the New England coast. 



The genus Tannic may be distinguished from all others by the pos- 

 session of one-branched uropods, pleopods on the first three segments 

 only of the pleon and incubatory sacs at liases of the fifth pair of 

 limbs. Sars in his re-(lefinition of the genus says, " uropoda brevia, 

 siinplicia, ramosingulo bi-vel ti-i- articulate). " His figure of T. rarolinU 

 possesses four joints, though Milne Edward's figure has but three. 

 Tmiais (Zeu.ro) Wesfiroodiaiia has .six joints, T. IiirsutK.i has twelve 

 and T. novae, zeakuidae has five, one more than the species just 

 described. 



T. robmtm differs from T. vittatus, the only other New Jersey 

 member of the genus, by its greater robustness and tapering body, 

 by the possession of one more joint in the pleon and in the absence 

 of setiferous bands crossing the fii-st two segments of the pleon.

EE-EXPLORATION OF HAETMAN'S CAVE. NEAR STROUDSBURO, PENN- 

 SYLVANIA, IN 1893. 



BY H. C. MERCER, 



Rumor had reported the existence of a cave in Monroe County, 

 Pennsylvania, which Mr. T. Dunkin Paret after some searching 

 discovered in 1880 on the top of a hill overhanging Cherry Creek, 



Fig. 1. Entrance to Hartman's Cave. 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 97 



about four miles from Stroudsburg. Eight huudred feet above and 

 five miles west of the Delaware Kiver, with its nearest drinking water, 

 the creek, one-fourth of a mile down the steep, and eight or nine miles 

 north of the glacial moraine, the damp, chilly hole seemed hardly a 

 good lair for beasts, much less a shelter for men. 



Original discoveries of Mr. Paret. — When Mr. Paret had 

 removed the debris which choked its broad arch, Fig. 1, 

 so that a man could scarcely wriggle like a snake 150 feet 

 in, he encountered traces of men and animals in a top layer of 

 limestone roof-sjjlinters and down-slidden outer talus thinning 

 inward into less stony cave earth. All this relic- bearing material 

 lay upon a bed of clay of unprobed depth which appeared to- over- 

 spread the whole cave bottom, and it was always above this clay and 

 never in it, that ]Mr. Paret's workmen found (often in his 

 absence, for business prevented his continued supervision) the speci- 

 mens collected : the thin chipped blade of argillite (fifty feet in to 

 the extreme right; depth not stated, the four bone awls; the pots- 

 herd, (outside the entrance on a ledge) ; the bone fish-hook, needle and 

 harpoon;^ along with remains of the lynx, gray fox, wolf, skunk, 



^ I have just recieved the following interesting letter from Mr. Paret : 



Stroudsburg, Pa., March 25, 1894. 



Dear Sik : 



Youi-s of 10th at hand and I am obliged for your letter and for your 

 slip as to the cave discussion at the Academy of Nat. Sciences. Have you bad 

 the clay examined microscopically ? If not, it might be advisable. Something 

 might be learned as to its origin. 



The potsherd was not dug out. It was not found by my men, but a visitor 

 who picked it n^froni Ihe surface, from that shelf of rock, away up on the right, 

 (as you face the cave) wliere I and a man worked a little while you were 

 there. It was outside of the cave entirely, on a rock shelf, at foot of clill", away 

 above the cave level. The shell has a curious history : One of my men brought 

 it to me His two boys got into a quarrel at home, he interfered and found they 

 were disputing for the shell. He asked where it came from and they said, from the 

 cave; so he took it away from them. He told me it was full of clay and that he 

 washed it out. He is a inan in whom I have implicit trust. The argillite blade 

 and peccaiy jaws were found about same time and place — about 50 feet inside ()f 

 cave, on extreme right. The fish-hook was found on same side, but not so far in. 

 I do not think there is anything to prove how old the horse tooth is. The one 

 striking fact to me is that no stone tool has l)een found at any depth or dug out. 

 The potsherd was on bare rock. The arrowhead I found was in earth on a flat 

 rock — only a few inches covered and a few inches of earth below. Hut the bone 

 tools were' all dug from l)elow the surface. Boys tiilk is tliat many stone tools used 

 to be picked up on the rock shelves iu.side of the cave. Why were none found in 

 the soil as those of bone were? 



I feel sure that if stone was in free use when the bone was, some would have 

 been found^with the t)one. ... I am firm in my belief that your trench 

 is of snuill value till a uiucli longer one is extended at right angles outwards. I 

 also believe that if all the debris in front of cave was removed mui'h more might 

 be found. Your trench simply proved that no hunum or animal remains wen- 

 contained in a cross cut of that length and narrow width. There is room outside 

 it for many hearths at various levels. . . . 



Yours truly.

 mouse, white field mouse, wood rat, gray rabbit, deer, elk, wild 

 turkey, turtle, box turtle, snapper, snake, three species of Helix, 

 a I'uio and a Margaratina, besides (to make the discovery par- 

 ticularly noteworthy) the following remarkable objects : 



(1) A perforated marine shell" bead made from the Conus tornatus, 

 alleged by a farmer to have been brought from the cave trench by his lit- 

 tle sons, which, on the authority of Mr. Geo. W. Tryon in 1880, and 

 Mr. Pilsbry in 1894, belongs to the Pacific Coast mollusca of Central 

 America and which therefore suggests the Avhole question of aborigi- 

 nal trade and the query whether the cave occupants had really ob- 

 tained a shell from somewhere nearly two thousand miles away. 



(2) Several teeth of the reindeer (Rangifer caribou) which seem 

 to infer a colder climate. 



(3) A tooth of Bison americanus asks us to account for 

 the presence of this browsing animal of the Mississippi Plains in 

 the easternmost mountain steeps of the great forest. 



(4) The jaws and teeth of the extinct peccary, Dycotyles Pennsyl- 

 vanicHS, which with (5) the teeth of the extinct giant chinchilla, Cas- 

 toroides ohioensis, suggest antiquity, though we cannot yet prove 

 that these animals became extinct in Pennsylvania more than 300 

 years ago. 



(6) Two teeth of a horse, discovered at a point and depth not noted, 

 which Dr. Leidy (who visited the cave in 1880 and identified all the 

 bones then found by Mr. Paret, see Ann. Report of Geolog. Surv. 

 of Pennsylvania, 1887, p. 1-20) says belong to an indigenous species. 

 If this be so it may well set us to wondering what aborigines on the 

 hilly upper Delaware were doing with horses before the time of Co- 

 lumbus. 



*Mr. Paret has not understood that my cross trench in the outer talus (see 

 Fig. 2) contained both human and animal remains, in fact revealed a layer of 

 Indian occupancy, 1 foot thick and 1 1-2 to 2 feet below the surfece. This layer 

 must once have continued into the cave and the only question is was it the only 

 layer in the cave or were there other layers under it which I did not find outside? 

 Why, asks Mr. Paret, were no stone tools found underground (if the knife is an 

 exception) by Mr. Paret's men ? There is nothing un-Indian about the bone tools 

 found. 



I should answer : because the men had missed seeing the few small, dull look- 

 ing objects that would have told tlu' tale. The single barbed bone arrow or spear 

 is common to Eskimo and Indian, and there is, I believe, nothing un-Indian 

 about any of the bone tools discovered.

NATURAI, SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA.

Neither Dr. Leidy nor Mr. Paret has asserted that the human 

 remains of this second known cave of importance in the Delaware 

 Valley were those of Indian? or any other people definitely named, 

 or that the bones, often rodent-gnawed, and the scanty human refuse 

 belong to one and the same period of occupancy, so it seemed worth 

 while for the sake of the buried human story of the Delaware Valley 

 to go back to the cave in October 1893, and study what might be 

 left of the original layers to determine if possible : 



(a) Whether the animal and human remains were contemporane- 

 ous. 



(b) Whether the human remains were Indian remains. 



(e) Whether the human remains were of geologically ancient or 

 modern date. 



Present Condition of the Cave. — INIr. Paret showed me the 

 cave on the hill top October 17, 1893. Nearly all the 

 upper stratification had been shovelled out until one could 

 walk in under the broad, chilly arch for 117 feet, 6 inches. 

 But as the uufathomed clay remained underfoot from end to end 

 and fringes of the original debris lay along the right and left 

 walls just inside the entrance, and as the talus heap outside had only 

 been trenched through the middle to clear an ingress and so showed 



Fi(i. 2. 



its original stratification when its edges were pared down (Fig. 2, c. 

 a. e.), there seemed some chance of recovering the lost threads of 

 the story. 



The Contemporaneity of Human and Animal Remains. — 

 Two men shovelling five days in the inner clay and slicing the 




100 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



outer talus, our examination of the remaining small fringes of 

 debris brought us to the first question : 



Were the animal and human remains contemporaneous? 



If they were not, no matter what the bison, horse, chinchilla and 

 reindeer meant in the cave, their bones told us little of the date of 

 Man's visit, and their discovery formed no interesting link between 

 archaeology and paleontology. Our trench 40 feet in from the en- 

 trance, 3 teet, 8 inches wide, and 22 feet, 3 inches long, dug for possible 

 hidden layers and bottom, at right angles across the cave floor showed 

 a contirjuous homogeneous bed of exquisitely fine clay, deposited 

 in thin larainic rarely sprinkled with sand pockets and underlaid 

 with a film of sand resting on an uneven limestone floor at 5 feet, 

 11 inches; 10 feet, 7 inches; 11 feet, 6 inches and 14 feet, 1 inch. 



As no sign of life, no interrupting layer from top to bottom 

 was apparent, it seemed that it could be relieved of all connection with 

 Mr. Paret's discoveries. The animal remains and human refuse 

 must have all belonged to the debris and cave earth aljove it, and it 

 only remained to be asked before we were done with this all import- 

 ant test of sti-atification whether Mr. Paret's relic- bearing upper de- 

 posit of roof slivers, rotten leaves, human relics, bones, charcoal and 

 ashes, gathered dust and iurolled talus consisted of one layer homo- 

 geneous throughout, telling of one uninterrupted time of occupation, 

 or of several layers differing in character, separated by interplaced 

 bands proving time intervals between the visits of INIan and beast. 

 The trouble was that nearly all this cave floor material had been dug 

 away and all we had to guide us was what was left of it, its outer end 

 so to speak, in the talus. But when we cut into this talus just out- 

 side the entrance we did what we would have done had we explored 

 the cave at the start, and when we found a thin layer of human occu- 

 pancy in it 1 foot thick and 1 ^ to 2 feet below its surface we inferred 

 that this human layer was but a continuation of the lost human layer 

 inside the cave. Yet as the conditions for soil formation outside 

 probably differed from those inside the cave, and as we only penetra- 

 ted 10 to 12 feet into the outer talus without reaching the clay or its 

 equivalent that should have been below it, there was a chance that 

 our talus was not a fair end slice of the cave, and that there might 

 have ])ecn several human layers inside against the single one in the 

 talus outside. 



Too much critical ground had been lost and we had to be satisfied 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 101 



with the rediscovery of one human layer at least, which we had a 

 right to call either the single layer or the uppermost of a series of 

 layers originally found in the cave. To its date or to a later time 

 evidently belonged the bones which Professor Cope, who has assisted 

 me in this work, has kindly identified of the turkey, chipmunk, cat 

 squirrel, marmot, smaller vole, larger vole, short tailed shrew, 

 raccoon, skunk, gathered by Mr. Paret and myself in the aforesaid 

 side fringes of debris just inside the entrance. 



But as to the original bones found in 1880, careful side cutting into 

 the cave floor in the first place might have shown which of the dis- 

 covered fragments were really part of the cave feast too well bedded 

 between the fire sites to have been scratched out of older under layers 

 and into newer and later layers and which were not, but these clues 

 have been lost. 



In some caves every bone found has seemed fairly and clearly 

 part of the iNIidden heap. But it was against all the evidence pro- 

 duced at Hartman's that the place had been a lurking hole for 

 small animals. Some had come into the crevices to die, leaving 

 their skulls. Others, whose bones rodents had gnawed, had been 

 brought in by carnivora in the first place or carried by pilfering ro- 

 dents from the human feast. 



There is, therefore, only a probability that Man killed and ate the 

 bison, castoroides and peccary in Hartman's Cave, since, minus the 

 lost layers, we may say that there is no proof that these animals did 

 not come there to die, or that they were not carried in whole oi" 

 piecemeal by large carnivora when their bones, though lying on the 

 cave floor long before Man's advent, would have come in close contact 

 with his subsequently built hearths. 



The nature of the human remains. No proof that they were not of 

 Indian make. — As to the second question : Wore the remains 

 Indian remains? The Trenton gravel jNIau if we grant his existence 

 must be ruled out of Hartman's Cave, for there was not one of his 

 described rude, leaf-shaped, turtle backs found among the chipped 

 blades and arrowheads that in themselves denied his existence there. 

 Whether the human remains found by Mr. Paret came from the same 

 layer in which I found mine or from other layers now untraceable, there 

 is no need of searching for a new and as yet undescri bed cave occupant 

 to account for the bone awls common at the Trenton Delaware 

 Valley site found by me in the Indian layers at the P^orge Cave in 




102 PKOCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



Virginia, at the Huninielstown Cave in Dauphin County, Pennsyl- 

 vania and at the Nickajack and Lookout Caves in Tennessee. The 

 hamraerstone, argillite cache blade, pottery and chert arrowheads 

 are duplicated at the Lenape villages at Point Pleasant, Ridges 

 Island and Gallows Kun on the Delaware River, while the single 

 barbed bone spear from a shell heap explored by me in September 

 1891 on York River, Maine, can be again referred to the Red Man. 



We may safely say that the notion of a precedent people vanished 

 at Hartraan's Cave, and that the only Man that I found there or 

 that I have reason to suppose that Mr. Paret found there as the 

 possible contemporary of the reindeer, and bison, extinct peccary and 

 giant chinchilla was the chert- using, pottery-making Indian of the 

 Delaware Valley, already the possessor of the bow and arrow and the 

 quarry denoting cache blade. 



Antiquity of the human remains. — When we ask the third ques- 

 tion : Were the human remains of geological antiquity or of 

 modern date and, granting the association ot the extinct mammal bones, 

 use their presence to prove great age. We must remember that the ab- 

 sence of historical mention which largely gives the word "extinct" 

 its meaning, and which in Europe reaches back 2000 years at once, 

 has here as yet but a proved retrospect of hardly more than three 

 centuries. The fact that John Smith or the Jesuits did not ob- 

 serve the peccary in the northern United States does not disprove its 

 scanty or straggling existence in their time, and we cannot be cer- 

 tain that, as Jefferson supposed, a few superannuated mammoths 

 were not hiding in forest corners as late as the 18th century. Only 

 the correlation of the fauna of many more caves with human remains 

 can give us a just notion of the time-span of many of these animals 

 and make definite the still vague border line between archaeology 

 and paleontology. 



The problem of the clay. — It is for geology to explain the ex- 

 quisitely fine laminated clay containing no sign of life that so deeply 

 covers this cave floor. 



It must have been quiet water holding mud in solution that laid it 

 there, film upon film, nor could the process have been arrested by 

 dry intervals or the visits of men and beasts, since no dissimilar, dry 

 laid or life betokening stratum interrupts it. How this beautiful clay, 

 widely unlike the coarse, red deposits in the Lookout and Nickajack 

 Caves in Tennessee or the Durham Cave, 10 miles below Eastou on 




1894.] NATURAL, SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 108 



the Delaware, got into its place with nowhere save the gritty hill 

 crest just above to come from, is the question. Could it have been 

 the residuum of the rock decomposition which originally formed 

 the cave cavity or in other words the rubbish of cave ero- 

 sion choking up three- fourths of the eroded hole?^ We would 

 know how and why successive pools of yellow mud-bearing water 

 could cover the floor once upon a time and not now, where 

 the water came from, since any down running rivulet would 

 have rolled in the hillside grit with it, and why the flooding pro- 

 cess was not interrupted by intervals, when animals came in and de- 

 bris was formed ? 



A possible answer to these questions seems to be suggested in the 

 important and interesting fact that Hartman's Cave lies eight miles 

 north of the glacial moraine, differing therein by position from all 

 other caves in the United States lying to the southward of the now 

 well-known silhouette of pebbles that profiles the southern limit of ice 

 advance. It is therefore one of those glaciated caves distinct and 

 individual by position, full, perhaps, of new secrets for us, which, if 

 the glacial theory be true, must have been sealed up with superin- 

 cumbent ice like a tightly corked bottle throughout most of the frozen 

 period. 



If this clay is due to the banking up of ice and the draining of 

 muddy glacial waters into the caves' mouth then we can account for 

 it, but if ice damming and ice water had nothing to do with it, and 

 on the other hand it is due to a subsequent submergence of the hill 

 top below water level in the Champlaiu period, then similar clay beds 

 ought to be found in caves, like Durham, south of the moraine and 

 their absence remains to be accounted for. 



Moreover if this clay is glacial then other caves north of the 

 moraine should show the same ice-sealed barrier, beyond which no 

 preserved relic of post glacial age penetrates. 



The Indian and his relics, the fossil castoroides and peccary, 

 were left behind as we got down into the clay with nothing before us 

 it seemed but the beginning of the cavern itself Was the cave then 

 no older .than the melting ice ? If so, why and how had the

disintegrating streamlets which made it at the same time nearly filled 

 it with the residuum of their own erosion ? If it was older than the 

 ice sheet, why were no tertiary fossils associated ^vith the quater- 

 nary ? None of the bones that protrude from the bleak gorges 

 in the bad lands of Texas to frighten Indians have ever been 

 found in subterranean rock hollows. We found none of these in 

 or below this clay in Hartman's Cave. Had they never lain 

 there, or, coming in like their quaternary succesf^ors, had they been 

 washed out, or, as Prof. Cope suggests, had the whole tertiary fossil- 

 bearing end of the cave been eroded away in the lapse of time ? How- 

 ever this may be, if we are right, the clay in Hartman's Cave marks 

 with the precision of a pointing clock hand, the hour of the glacier in 

 the world's history. What is under tlie clay comes before what is 

 over it, after the ice. 



If the ice made the clay we must go back, not to any event since 

 the clay (post glacial) or any event during the clay-making (glacial) 

 but to some event before (preglacial) to find a force, whether of cave 

 washing or cave erosion, that could have swept this cave clean of the 

 fossil remains of creatures that lived before the quaternary.

 may occasion surprise. 



Professors Benj. Sharp and W. Libbey, Jr. who visited a number 

 of the Pacific Islands during the past year, secured, on the Island of 

 Kauai, a specimen Avhich, in external appearance, very much re- 

 sembles chalk. Although definite information as to its relation to 

 adjacent solfataras and cracks is desirable it has not been obtained, 

 nor is it known whether the material is rare or abundant. 



The specimen weighed l)ut a few ounces. To the eye it appears 

 to be amorphous and made up of an extremely fine powder which 

 soils the fingers when touched. Despite its softness the particles ad- 

 here firmly, its hardness l^eing about 0. 5. It can be easily cut 

 with a knife into any shape, precisely like chalk. It is perfectly 

 dull to the reflected ray of light ; the color is nearly white or, to be 

 exact, of a faint cream tint. One side of the specimen is covered 

 with a thin coating of brown oxide of ii*ou. The streak is white and 

 its lines on a black-board cannot be distinguished from lines made 

 with white chalk. Only formless granules are revealed under the 

 microscope and, strange to say, increasing power serves but to show 

 more of the granules in the field without any inci*ease in size. In 

 all of the granules the diameters seem to be about the same. 



If the raatei-ial be iml)edded in balsam and interposed between the 

 crossed Nicol prisms, light is transmitted. The ray of light trans- 

 mitted under these conditions is pale blue and no other color of 

 polarization is produced. By this means the particles can lie ob- 

 served to the best advantage, as, when projected on a dark back- 

 ground, singly and in groups, the contrast favors observation. In the 

 manner that the modern chemist describes the molecule do these fine 

 particles form groups and the })icture presented in the field 

 of view so strikingly resembles the molecular conception of the 

 present day as to almost tempt one to believe that the atom had at 

 laat become visible, provided we assumed that the fine particles

of the material, as revealed under the microscope, are atoms. It 

 possesses no dichroism. Specific gravity 2.566. 



When heated in a Bunsen flame it slightly decrepitates and emits 

 the vellow light due to sodium. When heated in a test tube it 

 gradually becomes dark gray, indicating some carbonaceous matter 

 and, when heated strongly, an oily matter and water having an acid 

 reaction are emitted. Heated with the blowpipe on charcoal with 

 carbonate of soda it effervesces and finally produces a white enamel. 

 Heated by itself, on the charcoal, it produces an intense white incan- 

 descence and, reheated ^vith cobalt solution, a fine blue is obtained. 



It is not soluble in water, sulphuric, hydrochloric or nitric acids, 

 but if boiled with a caustic alkali it dissolves. If, however, the 

 substance is brought to a red heat and there maintained for some 

 time, it is then dissolved by any of the above named acids. 



The chemical analysis, made in duplicate, resulted as follows : 



Alumina (ALiO^) 33.40 per cent. 



Sulphate alumina (ALI O3 SO3 ) 7.18 " 



Sulphate potassium (£.804) 17.00 " " 



Sulphate sodium (KAo SO4 ) 4.91 " 



Water. (Ho 6) 31.57 " 



Carbonaceous matter, difference 5. 94. 



The carbonaceous matter was not especially determined in the be- 

 lief that in all probability it is an accidental admixture foreign to the 

 composition of the original substance. 



From the analysis above given it is evident that the compound is 

 a highly basic sulphate, and, eliminating the percentage of carbona- 

 ceous matter and finding the oxygen ratios between the sulphur triox- 

 ide, the alumina and all the monoxides, the composition ' determined 

 is as follows: 



Alumina (AL. 0;j ) 39.79 per cent. 18.68 per cent. Oxygen, 



Potassium oxide (K- O) 7.37 " " 1.25 " " " 



Sodium oxide (NA.> O) 1.72 " " 0.44 " " " 



Water (H, 6) 33.56 " " 29.82 " " 



Sulphur trioxide (SO;.) 17.55 " " 10.52 " " " 



The ratios of the S6:j , ALo O^ , iv. O are nearly as : 

 1, 2, 3 



which may be represented by the formula : 



(AL,0,) ,-S03-(R,0),. 



Here R, represents Ko , NAj , H2 . 



There are a number of basic sulphates recorded, all of which seem 




1894. NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 107 



to l)e soluble in acids, although the one under discussion is not. I 

 would, therefore, propose Katiaiife as a name for the new variety. 

 The extremely fine division and the approach to crystallization with- 

 out forming true geometi'ical solids may suggest the mode of its for- 

 mation. It may, with the exception of the carbonaceous matter, be 

 ejected as volcanic. An objection might be based on the large 

 percentage of water, but we must remember that in some volcanoes 

 water is an almost constant ingredient of their ejectments, and we may, 

 therefore expect to occasionally meet with so-called hydrous com- 

 pounds in the material thrown out. The aluminium may have been 

 distilled by the intense volcanic heat together with the other elemen- 

 tary metals and metalloid sulphur. Coming in contact with the 

 atmosphere, the material was oxydized and quickly precipitated on 

 the cooler surface of the earth, giving no time for the formation of 

 crystals. If corundum is reduced and volatilized by the heat pro- 

 duced in the electrical furnace, we may expect similar results from 

 the enormous heat energy of a volcano. 



Volcanic Stalactites. — That the highly heated and very fluid lava 

 in the crater of Kilauii, as well as in other craters, is occasionally 

 shot up into the air some thirty feet or more, has been reported at 

 various times and has also been observed by the gentlemen before 

 referred to. Such lava in its descent through the air becomes very 

 porous. If such a highly porous rock have a space underneath, a 

 fresh deposit of liquid lava will trickle through the porous cooled 

 lava, forming as it solidifies the pendent stalactites shown in Plate VI. 

 These stalactites are about one-fourth of an inch thick and about 

 eight inches long. They show no disposition to form cones like those 

 usually seen in limestone caves. These slender, gnarled, rod-shaped 

 formations are mostly hollow and porous and so brittle that it is diffi- 

 cult to prepare a thin section for microscopical study. The color is 

 usually a deep black, sometimes a part is of a brownish tint, due, 

 probably, to a higher oxidation of the magnetite present. Occasion- 

 ally a gray color is noticed but this is caused by the incrustation of 

 some other substance. To ascertain its probable raineralogical com- 

 position, it was necessary to use the fine powder, imbedding it as usual 

 in balsam. The fragments examined beneath the microscope indicate 

 a glassy feldspar having apparently the characteristic of sanidine. 

 They contain magnetite in great profusion and also gases, 

 probably air. A dichroic mineral is also recognizable in the mixture,

but whether it is augite or not is at present uncertain. A fragment 

 weighing 2.459 grams in air, and 1.297 grams in distilled water had 

 a specific gravity of 2.11, evidently far too low for lava as generally 

 known, undoubtedly due to the extremely porous nature of the ma- 

 terial. By producing a coarse powder and taking the specific gravity 

 in a picnoraeter, the result is 2.85. 



Considered from a chemical standpoint, this lava is decidedly 

 basic, Jis the quantity of silica determined analytically was 48.55 

 per cent. 



The specific character of this rock, now shown in the form of stalac- 

 tites is that of the so-called vesicular basalt. 



On some of these volcanic stalactites, there had formed a thin 

 layer of colorless crystals so small that their form could be recog- 

 nized only under power. These 

 thin prismatic crystals are attach- 

 ed to one end and terminated by 

 short pyramids; on certain faces 

 they are longitudinally striated. 

 In the groups are frequently seen 

 twin crystals whose dual faces 

 are mostly the longer axis. Fig- 

 ure 1, magnified about 4 diame- 

 ters, shows how the crystals are 

 attached to the volcanic stalac- 

 tites. A slide, prepared and ob- 

 served under a power of about 

 45 diameters shows the twin- 

 formations of the crystals, Fig. 

 2. That these crystals belong 

 to the monoclinic system is evident 

 from the fact of their inclined ex- 

 tinction which, upon measure- 

 ment, w'as found to be 37°, the 

 longer axis of the crystals being 

 zero to extinction over the pyra- 

 mid. The colors of polarization 

 were brilliant. Dichroism was 

 unnoticed in these forms. 

 With the aid of Toulet solution the specific gravity of the material

at my command (about 8 milligrams) was found to be 2.285. It is 

 soluble in water and gives the reactions indicating sulphur trioxide 

 and calcium oxide. The incrusting small crystals are, therefore, 

 selenite. 



Fig. 2. Crystal and twin forms of selenite, x 45. 



I am indebted to Professors Sharp and Libbey for the niatei'ial 

 studied and also for the photographs of the volcanic c^ve. 



Plate VI shows the entrance to the cave with its overhang- 

 ing roof of porous basalt from which are suspended the irregularly 

 gnarled rods of volcanic stalactite; on the floor are scattered 

 fanta-stic-shaped volcanic stalagmites which seem to be much 

 thicker than the pendant rods above.

DESCRIPTION OF A NEW ARMADILLO, WITH REMARKS ON THE GENUS 

 MTJLETIA GRAY. 



BY SAMUEL N. RIIOADS. 



Tatusia (Muletia) propalatum Rhoads. sp. nov.. Type No. 3349. Col. Acad. Nat. 

 Sci. Phila.. .juv. ad. 9. •'Baliia, Brazil, E. D. Cope.'' 



Size smaller than T. hijbrida Desm., with rehitively longer and 

 more slender tail, equalling length of body. Free rings of tail, ex- 

 cluding basal superior half- ring and subterminal attached ring, IG. 

 The last, with remaining distal portion of tail, measuring one-third 

 total length of tail. Posterior edges of caudal rings flaring, giving 

 the tail a roughly serrate outline. Distal end ot tail very slender, 

 pointed, the tesserje diamond shaped. Basal tail rings with double 

 row of tesserjie, the basal row' becoming relatively shorter nearest 

 body while on the last ( distal) rings the tesserte of both rows are of 

 equal length in each ring. Rows of tesserte on pelvic shield, counted 

 near border and including the wide anterior semi-free ring, 22. Free 

 dorsal rings, 7, preceded anteriorly by wide posterior ring of shoulder- 

 shield of tesserse similar in formation to dorsal rings. Larger tes- 

 sene of free dorsal rings slender, wedge shaped, their posterior cor- 

 ners scarcely divided by the points of slender awl- shaped intervening 

 tesserte, the bases of latter, half the width of ends of former. Rows 

 of tessera? on shoulder-shield counted near border, 17, similar in 

 arrangement of tesserae to those of pelvic shield. Ears five-eighths 

 length of head, finely scaled and set close together at base. Crescentine 

 coronal shield separated by a freely moving nexus of skin from 

 frontal cephalic shield. Three distinct rows of tesseric before and 

 beneath the eye. Frontal tessera* relatively smaller than in other 

 species of Tntusida: Manus 4-toed, pes 5-toed. From each papilla 

 of protected lower parts springs a short, slender bristling hair of same 

 colorasskin, averaging one-fourth inch in length. Skin yellowish white. 

 Upper parts and tail amber yellowish, nose and ears near tips 

 brownish,' the toes of same color. 



Skull slenderly and regularly pyriform. Zygomatic width not 

 exceeding the mastoid, tapering regularly to the rostrum. Greatest 

 depth of cranium over two-thirds its greatest width. Interorbital 

 width over two-thirds zygomatic width, the frontals nearly obscuring

the orbital fossa as viewed from above. Lachrymals triauaular, lateral, 

 not visible from above, their anterior apices overlying second posterior 

 upper grinder. Roof of mouth deeply grooved. Palatal bones slightly 

 hollowed centrally but without posterior raised edges. Pterygoids 

 rounded, divided by a slit 1 mm. wide their entire length, reaching 

 a slight postpalatal notch. Palatal bones anteriorly reaching be- 

 yond anterior base of last upper molar. Upper molar series ti on 

 a side : no indication of a seventh, on dissection. Lower molar series 

 8 on a side, including a minute thread-like anterior premolar, 

 evidently deciduous and widely separated from the next. Coronoid 

 process of mandible long and very slender. 



Measurements. — Body, along back, from fore end of shoulder 

 shield to I'oot of tail, 115*; head and neck, from tip of nose to 

 shoulder shield (above) 58; hind foot, 40; ear, from crown 29, 

 ■its greatest width (flattened) 19. Skull; occipito-nasal length, 48; 

 zygomatic breadth, 21; interorbital constriction, 15; length of 

 nasals, 15; basal length of upper molar series, 11; length of man- 

 dible, 34. 



The type specimen is about two-thirds of the maximum development, 

 judging by a series of skins and skulls of T. novemchicia. Tatusia 

 (Muletia) hybrida is the only described species with which it must be 

 compared. From hybrida in the Academy's collection it is 

 distinguished by: 1 seven free dorsal bands; 2 longer slender- 

 pointed tail; 3 comparative number of shoulder and pelvic 

 girdle rows ; 4 absolute number of free caudal rings ; 5 greater 

 relative length of ears; 6 much greater relative depth to width 

 of cranium; 7 much greater relative interorbital width; 8 

 separation (lateral) of the pterygoids; 9 palatine bones reaching 

 beyond anterior base of last upper molar (in Injbrida they fall short 

 of the molar series 1 mm.) ; 10 coronoid process slender from base 

 to tip, (not triangular). 



Dr. J. E. Gray in the Proceedings of the London Zoological 

 Society, 1874, page 244, redescribes the Short-tailed Armadillo, 

 Tatmia hybrida (Desm.), and places it in a new genus, which he 

 calls Muletia, separating it trom Tatusia in the following diagnosis : 



"1 Tatusia. Tail cylindrical, elongate, as long or longer than 



* Millimeters. 




1894.] NATl^RAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 113 



the body, of many rings and numerous caudal vertebnv?. Ears 

 large. Dorsal disk with 9-7 free bauds. Taiusia peha etc." 



"2. Malefia. — Tail short, depressed at base, not so long as the 

 body, with thirteen rings and thirteen caudal vertebrae. Ears small, 

 dorsal disk with six free bands. Mulctia septemeiucta etc." 



As above characterized. Dr. Gray's new genus is a fair sample of 

 more than half the new genera pi'oposed by him ! No very careful 

 examination will show that the two species which he makes typical of 

 these genera share equally some of the characters assigned as dis- 

 tinctive, while those given which are distinct are of doubtful generic 

 or subgeneric value. The number of free dorsal bands above is 

 doubtfully of more than specific value between the numbers 10 

 and 6. 7\ttusia novemcinda has from 8 to 10. Desmarest says that 

 '^ Dasyjms hybridus" has "six ou sept bandes mobiles a la cuirasse." 



However, in making an examination of the specimen above de- 

 scribed as new, I was struck to find in it not only a superficial re- 

 semblance to T. hijbrida as compared with T. peba, but that it agreed 

 with Dr. Gray's figure of hijbrkla (1. c. PI. XLI) in having only 

 twelve upper teeth as against the fourteen or sixteen always present 

 in T. novemcincta. To convince myself of the constancy of this 

 character I have examined several skulls of both species and found 

 no exception. In ail the other plates of the various newly described 

 Tatusiiice I have seen, in no case are they represented with less than 

 fourteen upper teeth. 



Should a more exhaustive examination show no exceptions, it 

 would be proper to at least accord subgeneric rank to il/»7e</a, with 

 the following diagnosis : 



Genus TATUSIA. 



Tail longer than body, its first basal ring complete, tlie distal two- 

 thirds with a well-defined inferior median canal, increasing in depth 

 with age, and in number to thi-ee and five near the extremity. 

 Caudal rings convex, each closely compressed posteriorly upon the 

 next. Dorsal disk with eight to ten free bands; upper molars, four- 

 teen to sixteen; lower molars, ditto. Type Tatiisia novemcincta 

 (Linn.) Ouv. 



Subgenus MULETIA. 

 Tail not exceeding length of body, not channeled distally. Cau- 

 dal rings with free, elevated j)osteri()r margins, the first basal seg. 




114 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



ment a crescentine half-ring, clasping the superior anterior portion of 

 second ring, the latter being produced forward beneath it. Dorsal 

 disk vriih six to seven free bands; upper molars, twelve; lower 

 molars, fourteen to sixteen. Type Tatusia {Muletia) hybrida 

 (Desm.j Gray. 



The nine-banded Armadillo, Dasypus novemdnctus Linnaeus, Syst. 

 Nat., 1758, 51, has quite generally gone under the specific name 

 peba of Desmarest, (Mamm. 1820, 368), who puts the septememctus, 

 odocinctus and uovemcinctus of Linnieus, Erxleben and Boddaert 

 among his synonyms, implying that these are composite species and 

 indistinguishable. The use of Desmarest's name pebo is unwar- 

 ranted, the original Linnsean de.scription and references relating, in 

 the main, unmistakably to the same animal., The first reference to 

 peha (Seba ]\Ius. I, p. 45, tab. 29, Fig. 1), is unmistakably the 

 nine- banded species; see also his reference to Marcgrave. 



Dr. Gray (sup, cit. pp. 245, 246), discusses the identity and 

 synonymy of Tatusia hybrida (Desm. ), and names it T. septemcincta 

 after Schreber (Saugt., 1775, II, 220), who there describes a species 

 which he considers the same as Linnaeus' Dasypus of the same name, 

 quoting the Systema Naturre, 12th edition, in which it is the same as 

 in the 10th. In these Linnaeus describes a "Dasypus'' — " D. 

 cingulis septenis, palmis tetradactylis, ^ * « Habitat in Indiis. " 

 Schreber's desci'iption and figure fairly represent what Dr. Gray 

 chooses to call "Muletia sejyfemcincta," but as this specific name was 

 first applied by Linnaeus to an unrecognizable Armadillo _/Vo?« India 

 it is inapplicable to a six-banded Armadillo from South America. 



Desmarest's Dasypus hybridus is the first indisputable name for a 

 short- tailed, six or seven- banded Tatusia from, tropical America. Dr. 

 Gray's disgust at the barbarous name of hybridus, by which Des- 

 marest probably referred less to the animal's pedigree than to its 

 asinine ears, seems utterly inconsistent with the naming of his new 

 genus. As such, however, it may nominally be allowed to stand, 

 not only as a warning to the future namer of names, but in the in- 

 terests of an overburdened synonymy.

A REVISION OF THE GENUS ANGUS. 

 BY WITHER STONE. 



Having recently had occasion to identify some specimens of Aiioiis 

 and make comparison with Gould's types of A. leucocapilliis and A. 

 melanojys, I was surprised to find what confusion existed in regard to 

 the proper disposition of the names which have been proposed for 

 several members of the genus. 



With the object of straightening out the synonymy of the group I 

 have made a careful study of the literature bearing upon the subject 

 and have examined the large series of specimens in the museum of 

 the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and a number of 

 specimens loaned to me by the U. S. National Museum through the 

 kindness of Mr. Robert Ridgway. 



The species of the genus Anousaxo. separable into two groups, the 

 larger dark colored birds {Anous) and the smaller light colored ones 

 {Pfocehterna). 



Of the latter there seem to be two well marked species, A. caern- 

 leus and A. cinereus, though Mr. Saunders, strange to say, unites 

 them in his monograph of the Sterninae (Proc, Zool. Soc. 1876, p. 

 671) wthout comment. 



In regard to the dark colored species there has been no confusion 

 in connection with the two large species, ^1. stoUdus and A. galapa- 

 gemis, but when we study the smaller species we immediately find 

 difficulties. 



Four names have been employed for the three recognizable species: 



Sterna tennirodris Temm. PI. Col. 202 (1838). 



Anous melanops Gould. P. Z. S., XIII, p. 103 (1845). 



Anom leiicocaplllm Goxild. P. Z. S., XIII, p. 103 (1845). 



Anous melanogeinjs Gray. Gen, Bii'ds, III, p. 661, PI. 182 

 (1849). 



Gould's A. melanops is regarded by Mr. Saunders as a synonym 

 of il. tetnilrostri.i (Temm.) and a comparison of the types with Tem- 

 minck's plate amply confirms his decision. 



The A. leitcociij>ilhiH of Gould, however, is the bird which Mr. 

 Saunders figures and identifies as A. melanogenys Gray. What 

 Gray's bird really is I am unable to say; if it is the species with 




116 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



which Mr. Saunders identifies it, the figure is certainly very poor, but 

 the name will have to be considered a synonym of A. leacocapillits 

 Gould. 



The sooty brouii-hhck species so well figured and described by 

 Mr. Saunders (P. Z. S, 1876, PI. LXI, Fig. 3) as " ^. leucocapillus 

 Gould " seems to be the most distinct of the three, but is, so far as I 

 can ascertain, unnamed. I therefore propose for it the name of A. 

 afrofiisrus. 



The following table will serve to distinguish the species: 



a. General color of plumage sooty-brownish, or blackish slate. 

 6. Size larger, wing 10 ins. or more. 



e. Plumage sooty-brown A. stoUdus 



c'. Plumage darker, more slaty ... A. galapagensis 

 h' . Size smaller, wing 9 ins, or less. 



c. Plumage %ooty-broion, white of head sharply defined 



posteriorly A. atrofaseus 



c' . Plumage blackish slate, white of head shading grad- 

 ually into the color of the back. 



d. Lores light slate colored A. temiirostris 



d'. Lores jet black A. leucocapilhis 



a'. General color of plumage very light gray. 



b. Nearly pure white beneath A. dnereus 



b' . Light gray beneath, nearly uniform with the back.

Mauritius (Saunders). 



The only specimens of this species that I have seen are the two 

 tyi^s of Gould's, A. melanops, a male and female from Hartman's 

 Abrolhos, Australia. These differ slightly from the figure given by 

 Mr. Saunders, for although the lores are light gray, they are uni- 

 form with the side of the neck rather than with the cap and there 

 is a distinct line of demarkation passing from the base of the upper 

 mandible opposite the nostril to the upper edge of the eye, instead of 

 from the gape as drawn in Mr. Saunders' figure. 



This species is lighter colored than the next two and' the cap is uot 

 so white, being nearly uniform pearl gray from the base of the bill to 

 the nape.

The jet l)lack lores and the darker slate black plumage readily dis- 

 tinguish this from the preceding species while the very different tint 

 of the plumage and the difference in extent of the white on the head 

 separate it from the following. 



Two specimens in the U. S. National Museum collection, oue 

 labelled " Dangerous Archipelago " and the other " Pacific Ocean " 

 belong to this species, and it is probable that all the remarks in the 

 Reports of. Peale and Cassin refer to this bird. This seems to be the 

 most abundant species of the genus after A. dolidns.

The 6/-oit«-black color of the plumage and the uniform white of 

 the crown, sharply contrasted with the broAvn of the neck easily dis- 

 tinguish this species. Mr. Saunders' figure (P. Z. S., 1876, PI. LXI, 

 Fig. 3) is an excellent representation of this bird, although in the 

 specimens before me the white of the head does not extend quite so far 

 back.

ON THE TRUE CHARACTER AND RELATIONSHIPS 

 OF URSUS CINNAMOMEUS Aud. and Bach. 



BY ARTHUR ERWIN BROWN. 



The original description of Ur-nt>^ americanus var. einiKimomtim^ 

 was based by Audubon and Bachman mainly upon fur-traders' 

 skins, and in the accompanying plate the animals were figured from 

 livnng specimens seen by Audubon in the Garden of the Zoological 

 Society of London. 



They characterize the species, briefly, thus : "Form and size of 

 the common American black bear, of which it is a permanent 

 variety. Color above, a dark cinnamon brown ; nose and a fringe 

 of hairs covering the claws yellow; " and regarding its range, they 

 say "sparingly found in the fur countries west and north of the 

 Missouri, extending to the barren grounds of the northwest. " 



In the absence of all cranial and dental characters in their des- 

 cription, it has usually been supposed that their animals were nothing 

 more than examples of the well-known brown phase of Urxu-'' auieri- 

 canu.% notwithstanding the fact that in their description of the latter 

 species (/. r. p. 188) the authors show that they were familiar 

 with its brown form and correctly estimated its position. 



Specimens have recently come under my observation which ap- 

 pear to show what Audubon and Bachman 's bear really was and 

 that it is well distinguished from the form with which it has for so 

 long been confounded. 



The history of the material on which these conclusions are based 

 is as follows: — In Decemlier, 1873, a male bear was received at the 

 Garden of the Zoological Society of Philadelphia, froraOgden, Utah, 

 which presented striking features of color and physiognomy when 

 compared with the already known species of American bear. This 

 specimen has always been associated in my mind with Audubon and 

 Bachman's description, above quoted, but he is still living and the 

 iin|)ossibility of making a detailed examiiuition of his skull has 

 hitherto prevented any definite conclusions from being reached. In 

 1884 a captive bear came to ray notice at Green River, Wyoming, 



' Quad, of North America, 1854, Vol. Ill, p. 12.5, I'l. CXXYII. 




120 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



which offered the same striking external features as the first. This 

 animal I tried to purchase, but without success. Several years later 

 I had the good fortune to kill a third specimen, also an old male, in 

 the elevated and rugged region north of the White River, Colorado. 

 The skin and skull were roughly prepared in camp, but were after- 

 ward irrecoverably lost. In November, 1891, the late James E. 

 Cooper, a well-known showman of Philadelphia, procured, at some 

 point on the Union Pacific Railway in Wyoming, and presented to 

 the Zoological Society, another individual, identical in appearance 

 with the three others. This specimen has since died and the skin 

 and skeleton are now" in the collection of the Academy. Finally, in 

 the summer of 1893, Prof. E. D. Cope procured in a cave in the 

 Ozark mountains, Missouri, a somewhat broken cranium of the same 

 type, which he has kindly placed at my disposal for investigation. 

 There are, therefore, presented for detailed examination two skulls, 

 a skin and one living specimen now in the Zoological Garden, and 

 while I am not able to give measurements from the skull collected by 

 me in Colorado, the features of the species are so extreme that I am 

 able to state without hesitation its substantial agreement with those 

 now presented. 



Cranial churacters. — The first impression made by these skulls is 

 of great breadth and massive development. The Academy's skull 

 (No. 3,308) is short and broad, offering the following measurements 

 in millimeters: — Basal length 274: basilar length 270; extreme 

 length 288; greatest zygomatic width 203; post palatal length 123; 

 length of palate 147; breadth between orbits 74; across postorbital 

 processes 105. The Ozark skull has lost a considerable portion of 

 the facial region, but the difference in size between it and 3,308 was 

 small; the distance from the inferior lip of the foramen magnum to 

 the plane of the front of the fourth premolar, being in the latter 212, 

 while in the Ozark sj)ecimen it is 216; in this one the zygomatic 

 width is about 198; interorbital breadth 80; across postorbital pro- 

 cess 114. 



The sagittal crest is high and massive, measuring in each 130 to 

 the point of division into the temporal ridges, which are strong, 

 especially in 3,308. The forehead is very concave, more so than in 

 any bear skull I have seen. In 3,308 it is also transversely con- 

 caves differing from the Ozark si)ecimen, in which the same region 

 is transversely convex. This specimen was perhaps a female. The 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 121 



iiasals iu both are short and rather broad. A most striking feature 

 is the great breadth of the zygomatic arch, anteriorly, which charac- 

 ter, more than any other, gives to the living animal its peculiar 

 l)hysiognomy. In 3, 308 the width at the glenoid fossae is 203 ; at the 

 hinder end of the palate it is but 5 mm. less and and at the plane of 

 the hinder edge of the second molar it is still 180. The broken con- 

 dition of the Ozark skull prevents the corresponding measurements 

 from being given, but enough remains to show' their essential agree- 

 ment. In keeping with this character is the increased width of the 

 palate posteriorly, which measures 45 at plane of anterior edge of 

 fourth premolar and 52 at rear end of hinder molar. 



The base of skull is somewhat concave ; a line from the inferior 

 edge of foramen magnum to the proximal border of the alveolus in 

 3,808 falls 16 mm. below the hinder end of the palate. 



The lower jaw is massive and heavy; the angular process strong 

 and curved upward ; the fossa for attachment of the masseter is ex- 

 traordinarily deep and rough. 



Dental characters: — The teeth in both skulls are much worn. 

 The hinder molar in the upper jaw is relatively of great size; in the 

 Academy's skull being .118 of the basilar length. The complete 

 series measures : m^ ^^^^ m^ nbl\h ^^ ^%x\n P^^ ^fxT)- ^^^ ^^^ 

 Ozark skull the lower jaw is missing and the only teeth remaining 

 are the upper right molars ; these measure : m- ''liii", m' llLL', p m'* 

 ii^. The crowns of the teeth have been worn almost away and it 

 is clear that the hinder molar, especially, measures less than at an 

 earlier period. The second upper molar is broad and rounded be- 

 hind, the width being carried pretty well back to the posterior end; 

 in the Ozark specimen the outer side is somewhat sloped ofi' behind 

 as in hornbilis, although it may be doubtful if this condition was 

 marked in the unworn tooth; there are three inner and two outer 

 cusps. The first molar is short and broad, with four cus{)S. The 

 fourth premolar is rather short and narrowed in front, the shelf-like 

 projection of the cingulum on the forward inner corner being less 

 than in the grizzly. 



The lower teeth are much worn; the fourth premolar had one 

 cusp, from which there are remains of two longitudinal ridges to the 

 hinder end ; it is not easy to say w^hether the small tubercle on the 

 iiuier base of the cusp was also present, but there is some indication 

 that it was.

Color and form. — The living specimens of this bear which have 

 been under observation were of similar color, in winter ])elage a rich 

 cinnamon brown. The two which have lived in the Zoological Gar- 

 den for more than one season, became in summer of a pale bleached 

 brown, or Isabella color. The skin in the Academy's collection, be- 

 longing to skull 3, 308 is almost flaxen. 



The size of the four living specimens was nearly the same, about 

 5ft., 6 in. from nose to tail. 



The claw is short and curved as in americamis. 



The great anterior width of the zygomatic arch and the hollow 

 forehead are faithfully reflected on the outer surface in these bears, 

 the sharp drop between the eyes and the laterally pinched-in muzzle 

 giving them a peculiar and unmistakable, fox-like look. 



Identity and relationship. — In studying out the correct assignment 

 to be made of these bears, a considerable mass of material has been 

 examined, including, through the kindness of Mr. Oldfield Thomas, 

 the series of ardos and other bears in the British Museum ; and also 

 the collection of the Royal College of Surgeons, London. 



The great range of individual variation in most species of Ursus, 

 is well known : in my own observations amounting, in the leading 

 proportions of the skull, to over twenty per cent, in ardos; sixteen 

 per cent, in american us, with a somewhat smaller i-ange in horri- 

 bilis. 



The table following shows the main standard measurements of the 

 skull in cinnamomeus, ardos, horrihilis and americamis, arranged 

 for convenience of comparison in the descending order of proportional 

 breadth ; the skulls selected for measurement pretty well covering 

 the extreme range in both directions. The proportions of zygomatic 

 breadth and length of hinder upper molar are expressed in 

 thousandths of the basilar length : —

Taking tlie inesm measurements of these skulls, horribilis presents 

 the narrowest, with a relative average breadth of .638 and a molar 

 of .112, — its maximum breadth falling for below that of a?»ertca»»s, 

 from which it differs also in color, size and claw. 



The great frontal concavity, l)rea(lth of skull and more than all, 

 great size of the inolar, would appear to remove cununnomcm very far 

 from amerieanus, but this comparison will be recurred to after con- 

 sidering the variations of arrtos. 



In both of the proprjrtions given, rlinKvmomem greatly exceeds the 

 average of a/YjtoN, which is breadth .700; molar .107, — in each, how- 

 ever, it falls within the extremes oi this unstable species, the greatest

124 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



proportional breadth in arctos being .786 and the longest molar .121^ 

 This very wide arctos skull, however, presents the striking feature 

 of having the smallest molar of any examined by me .094 — and, 

 in fact, these measurements show that in this species an inverse pro- 

 portion pretty constantly exists between these characters; the widest 

 skulls have small molars, while the narrower ones have them of large 

 size and grade by a regular series into the proportions of horribilis. 

 Thus, in tlie eight arctos skulls given above, the four widest give an 

 average length of . lOli to the molar, while the four narrowest give 

 .1121 for the corresponding ratio. In contradistinction to this inverse 

 relation, the exact opposite exists in cinnamomeus, — great breadth 

 being here conjoined with great size of molar. 



In some old skulls of arctos a considerable holloAvness of the fore- 

 head is found, but in no case equal to that of 3,808 and the Ozark 

 skull. These features of great breadth, frontal concavity and great 

 massiveness are, of course, among those which increase with age, but 

 it is a significant fact that we find them associated here in skulls of 

 very moderate size. The individuals of cinnamomeus which have 

 come under my notice were very old, three being males and the 

 fourth perhaps female ; they are so nearly equal in size that they 

 may be justly assumed to represent a fair extreme of growth for the 

 species. In 3,308 the skull is 288 mm. in greatest length, while to 

 find anything like an approximation to the same characters in arctos 

 or even to get correspondingly old skulls, it is necessary to go to those 

 from 50 to 80 mm. greater in length. 



Comparing the above proportions, cinnamomeus, while greatly ex- 

 ceeding in both, the average of arctos, is yet surpassed in breadth by 

 one example and in length of molar by one; — arctos has two speci- 

 mens narrower than the broadest horribilis, one of them being the nar- 

 rowest of either species and six have larger molars than the shortest of 

 the American form. The difference in average breadth between arctos 

 and americanus is comparatively small and they overlap greatly, 

 while the largest molar of the latter species is equal to, or larger than 

 four of arctos. 



It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that these proportions are 

 too irregular to be of importance except in groups of averages, and 



'This skull is not fully adult and is the shortest examined. With maturity 

 the proportions of this tooth would somewhat decrease.

their lack of value as specific characters may be readily estimated 

 from the follo\nng table, iu which they are presented for each form, 

 in parallel descending series, showing at a glance the extent to which 

 each overlaps the others : — 



Nor is there more constancy in the details of tooth structure. On 

 the whole, arrtos presents an u[)por hinder molar perhaps straighter 

 on the outer line and wider at its hinder extremity than is usual in 

 most of horrihUis, but the variations are great in both. Two adult 

 skulls of /to//-t7>///.v, collected by me in Colorado, within fifty miles 

 of each other, exhibit almost the extreme of each form. 



The fourth upper premolar is apt to be longer in arctos and in 

 liorribllls there is more of a shelf- like projection of the cingulum at 

 it.-* front inner corner, l)ut hardly any two are alike and in each, ex-

126 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



amples are to be found approximating to the narrow front usual in 

 americanus. In arctos and horyibills the fourth lower premolar has 

 but one cusp, on the posterior, inner base'of which a small projec- 

 tion or accessory cusp is usually found in the latter, with two longi- 

 tudinal ridges running back to end of the tooth. According to 

 Busk" the tubercle and its ridge are commonly wanting in nrdos 

 and when present are very small. In two specimens in the British 

 Museum, both tubercle and ridge are absent, in all the others it is 

 present, though variable and small — but in one specimen of Ursus 

 arctos imbellinus from Cashmir, it is quite as well developed as in 

 ordinary cases of horribilis. Dr. C. Hart Merriam ' appears to have 

 found this tubercle in two skulls of americanus from Prairie Mer 

 Rouge, Louisiana, in the National Museum. In the skull of c/^^a- 

 momeus (8,308) the ridge is unquestionably present and in all prob- 

 ability the tubercle as well. 



A tricuspid crown on this tooth appears to be diagnostic of ameri- 

 canus when it is present, but a large majority of this species examin- 

 ed by me, show but one cusp. 



A critical survey of the whole field of cranial and dental charac- 

 ters among the species here treated, reveals little that is constant but 

 variation, and absolutely forces the conviction that among them there 

 is not one, sufficiently stable and uniform to be of specific value. 

 The European bear and the American grizzly run into each 

 other so regularly that except in extreme cases there is little 

 possibility of distinguishing them certainly, or in many cases doubt- 

 fully, apart from geographical considerations, and this even is not a 

 safe guide, one skull in the British Museum, marked "Barren 

 Ground Bear," 321 mm. in extreme length, 229 zygomatic breadth 

 and 32 length of molar, being in all respects an ordinary skull of 

 arctos, which might just as well have been collected in Scandinavia 

 or Kamtchatka. Mr. J. A. Allen® does, in fact, regard this bear 

 as indistinguishable from arctos^. There is less difficulty in separat- 

 ing americanus from arctos, but even here it has been shown how 

 much their proportions overlap and one specimen from Transylvania,

in the British Museum, 295 mm. long, presents the flat frontal 

 outline and the relative width of the American black species, coupled 

 with the extreme dentition of aretos. 



Skulls of americaiius reach nowhere the extreme proportions of 

 ciiiitamomeus, nor in ordinary specimens is there much suugestion of 

 its outlines. Two remarkable skulls, however, in the collection of the 

 Academy (Nos. 2, 7 56 and 2, 7 5 7) from Sonoma Co . , California, marked 

 "brown bear" reach an extreme of breadth and length of tooth, in this 

 species, with a frontal depression almost equal to that of cinnamomeus, 

 although in the Sonoma specimens the plane of the forehead is con- 

 tinuous nearly to the end of the nasals and is but slightly concave. 

 These two skulls are the most extreme of americanus which I have 

 ever seen, but while I would have been glad to examine more speci- 

 mens of these brown bears than have been within reach, I am 

 yet prepared to hazard the belief that fully matured specimens will 

 show, as compared with black ones, a sometimes slight but fairly con- 

 stant excess both in breadth and size of molar. 



There can l)e here no question of specific difference, both colors 

 being found in the same litter of cubs and the fact can be explained 

 only by regarding it as an evidence of reversionary tendency to a 

 brown- colored, large-toothed ancestor, — such as aretos ; the physio- 

 logical correlation between hair and teeth being well known. If, as 

 I believe, the foregoing suggestion should be found to hold good in 

 a large series, there is certainly a tendency in brown specimens of 

 americanus iowaxdi the characteristics o^ cinnamomeus, and here also, 

 perhaps, room may be found for the special features of the Louisiana 

 skulls in the National Museum which Dr. IMerriam'" recently ascribed 

 to Ursiis luteolns Griffith. 



From these observations the conclusion is drawn that if horribilis 

 and americanus are to stand as good species, as distinct from arcios as 

 they undoubtedly are from each other, cinnamomeus must be con- 

 sidered as even a better one. But whatever the differences may be 

 among the American forms, taken by themselves, a comparison with 

 a large series of aretos, brings to light such a degree of instability 

 and intergvadation, that the only philosophical view which can be 

 taken of their relationship is that expressed some years ago by Mr. 

 J. A. Allen" but subsequently abandoned by him,'- at leitst so far as

ameriranii>< \s concerned, viz.: that leaving out maritimm, none of 

 our North American hears can be accorded higher rank than that of 

 subspecies of ardm. Indeed were it not for the comlnnation of 

 certain skull and tooth averages, with some tolerably constant differ- 

 ences in color and the increased size of the claw in American speci- 

 mens, it is doubtful if even this distinction could be maintained be- 

 tween arcios and horribilis ; both the large, broad-headed grizzlies of 

 California and the smaller, northern examples, pretty well closing 

 up the gap. 



In extreme cases amcricanHx has become more differentiated and 

 is constantly smallei*, but even here we have seen that the assumed 

 specific characters intergrade ; it is, however, better separated from 

 ardos than is JiorribiUs, and through its extreme forms the path to 

 cin)innu>m('ns\s perhaps indicated — as a large series of the latter may 

 show. Among Asiatic bears, isabellinus and probably syriacus are 

 also closely related. The general direction of these relationships 

 appears to point to some such scheme as this : 



ardos 



horrihiUx 



cinnamomevs 



americamis 

 isabellinus syriacus 



Audubon and Bachman's name appears to be correctly applicable 

 to the beai's whose cranial and dental characters are here given for 

 the first time. Thoy agree sufficiently well in external features and 

 in ge()graphi('al range as far as we have present knowledge, and the 

 assignment whicli I here make of them, I must regard as much pre- 

 ferable to the alternative course of imposing upon them a new name. 

 In the paper on Ur.-fus lutcolus, already referred to. Dr. Merriam 

 denies the applicability of cinnnmomeus to luteal us, and inferentially 

 to the present species, "because riuniinionnnu was based on an animal 

 from the northern Rocky Mountains, which has small molars, like 

 the common black boar of the northeastern United States." This 

 assumption, however, has no basis but in the fact that up to the 

 present time we liave known no brown bear from the Kocky Moun- 

 tain region otlun- than the small-toothed nmcrimuus, which has 

 erroneously been supposed to be the nninial on which Audubon and 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 12P 



Bachman fouuded their species, and falls to the ground with the ajv 

 pearance of the animal brought forward in this {\apor. leaving their 

 name free to be properly rehabilitated and establisheil. Auv other 

 course would be to hold these authors resjwnsible for our own past 

 ignorance and would lack in justice to them.

A REVIEW OF THE OLD WORLD RALLIN^. 

 BY WITMER STONE. 



While engaged in identifying the Rallidse in the collection of the 

 Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, I was impressed with 

 the confusion which exists in regard to the synonymy of the Old 

 World members of the family, more especially with reference to the 

 generic position of many of the species and the limitation of the 

 several genera. 



G. R. Gray, in his Hand List, has increased the confusion to an ex- 

 traordinary degree, and it is difficult to imagine how he conceived 

 such an arrangement as is there proposed. 



Having had occasion to make a thorough investigation of the 

 literature bearing upon the Old World Rails, I think it desirable 

 to prepare the following list of the described species and genera 

 which brings together in one paper all the references to pub- 

 lished descriptions. Lack of sufficient material has prevented me 

 from making a monogi'aphic study of the group, but where 

 specimens were at hand I have been able to judge of the specific re- 

 lations of various described forms and to arrange the synonymy 

 accordingly. 



In other cases where the validity of species was in doubt I have 

 had to depend upon the statements of those authors who have had 

 actual specimens for comparison. 



This paper was nearly completed before I had an oppor- 

 tunity of examining Dr. Sharpe's scheme of classification of the 

 EalUdui (Ibis, 1893, p. 258). This is a mere list of genera arranged 

 according to the author's views with diagnoses of a number of new 

 genera. 



While it is impossible without better material for me to criticise 

 Dr. Sharpe's general arrangement it certainly seems that some 

 closely allied forms have been unduly separated. For instance, 

 while the old genus Rougetins is easily separable into two groups of 

 probable generic rank it does not seem to me that tlie diflTerences 

 warrant the interposition of the entire series of Crakes between them. 




1894. NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 131 



It moreover seems hardly advisable to make so many genera out of 

 the old genus Porzana as is done in this scheme. 



Two of the generic names adopted by Dr. Sharpe ( Corethrura and 

 Rallina) are clearly untenable as is shown below. 



Although the Rails of the New World have been excellently 

 monographed by Messrs. Sclater and Salvin, P. Z. S. 1868, p. 442, 

 no recent attempt has been made at a systematic arrangement of the 

 Old World meml)ers of the family except in the paper by Dr. Sharpe 

 just referred to. 



The satisfactory arrangement in a lineal sequence of the genera of 

 any family, especially such a one as the Ralllda', is well nigh im- 

 possible, and there must necessarily be breaks in the series. 



From the typical Rails (Rallus and Hypotaenidia) we can run in 

 one direction through £(/^«6eor>//s and the Gymnocrex grovvp to the 

 Woodhens (^Ocydromus) ?in(\. again through Dryolimiias, Eougetius 

 and Euryzona towards the Crakes. In any case the genera Ocydro- 

 mus and Himantornis are extreme forms and had. better stand 

 separately at the end of the series than be interpolated in the middle. 



Cabalus is evidently allied to Hypotaenidia and Canindlus to 

 Euryzona though they are both aberrant forms. 



With these ideas in mind I have begun my list with the genera 

 most nearly approaching the Woodhens and followed with the true 

 Rails passing from them to the Crakes. As Dr. Sharpe says the 

 Crakes merge on the one hand into the Rails and on the other into 

 the Gallinules, Amanrornis being the connecting link with the 

 latter. 



Of the Crakes I have recognized eight genera as follows: Crex, 

 Porzana, Limnobaenus, Limnocorax, Sarothrura, Rallicula, Porz- 

 anula and Pennula. 



The Gallinules and Coots have not been included as I have 

 limited my paper to what are generally known as the Rallince though 

 it is an exceedingly difficult matter to draw a sharp line between the 

 several so-called subfamilies of the Rallidce. The genera Amanror- 

 nis and Oenolimiia.i ' have also been omitted as they seem to belong 

 ^vith the Gallinules, and also the genera Ocydromus ^ and Hbnantor- 



^Dr. Sharpe arranges this genus (type I?allina isabellina Sch].) with the 

 Crakes but it sccnisto iiu' closely allied to Atuaiirornis.

nis which are, as has already been stated, hardly to lie included with 

 the Rnllince.^

 Sciences of Philadelphia, I had the opportunity of studying the series

 The relegation of some of these names which have been in more or 

 less common use, to svnonymy requires some little explanation. 



Oiiygometra Leach, is simply a synonym of Crex though it has 

 been used wrongly for species belonging elsewhere. 



Zapornin, Cofurnicops, Phahiridion and Rallites, are all synonyms 

 of Porzana, the first two being well marked sub-genera. 



*Thea^ove list does not include a number of generic names proposed by 

 Heine in IKOO (Nomenel. Mus. Hein.) for well known genera of Bonaparte and 

 otlierauthors which had been in use for many years. Tliese names wimld. of course, 

 only find a place in the syuoiiomy and it seems scarcidy worth while to take any 

 notice of them, such a Wludesaie introduction of new names Iwint; a most un- 

 warrantable proceeding. One of Heine's names, however, Saiollinim. will 

 have to .stsmd as the name Corelliriira, for which it was proposed as a substitute, 

 is preoccupied. 




134 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



AlectheWt and Corethruni were both proposed for the small Rails 

 here called Sdvothrnra, but both names were already in use in 

 other connections. 



Biensis and Leu'inia are synonyms of Ball us. 



Ballina has been employed by various authors for a variety of 

 species. Reichenbach first proposed the name in his Synopsis Avium, 

 Vol. Ill, Rasores, Fam. Ralliute, including under it a large 

 number of species, and it has been generally used since for the 

 Rails allied to B. enryzona. It seems, however, that no type was 

 cited for the genus until the appearance of Reichenbach's Systema in 

 wliicli he restricts the name to the South American species allied to 

 B. maximus, this species being the' type. Unfortunately this species 

 had already been made the type of the genus Arainides, so that Bal- 

 lina becomes a synonym of this latter genus and we must adopt the 

 name Euryzona Bonap. for the Rails allied to B. euryzona as already 

 proposed by Dr. Stejneger (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., 1887, p. 396). 



SchizoptUa is a pure synonym of Gynmocrex while Kittlizia is pre- 

 occupied and the name Aphanolimnas was pi'oposed in its stead by 

 Dr. Sharpe.

 This genus comprises three groups of species:

feathers all white and which make an easy transition to 



Rallus through R. brachipus.

While it may be possible to separate this species into several races, 

 my material is insufficient to decide the question. As far as I can 

 see, however, such separation does not seem practicable. The 

 presence or absence of a buff breast band is not a constant character, 

 birds from the same locality showing great diversity in this respect. 

 The New Zealand bird has been separated by both Gray and Potts 

 but from such specimens as I have seen I fail to find any constant

 The species generally referred to this genus fall into two groups, 

 one containing the type and the other comprising R. bernieri of 

 Madagascar and its close allies from the adjacent islands. In the 

 former the bill is much smaller and weaker, though its shape and 

 proportions are about the same. For the latter group Dr. Sharpe 

 ha.^ proposed the generic name DryoJimuas and it seems better to re- 

 cognize tlie two genera.

 lS56. — Caniralb(s "Hartl," Bonap., Compt. Rend., XLIII, p. 600 

 (type Gallinula kilioides Pucb.). 



To this genus have been referred two species which are certainly 

 not congeneric, i. e., C. kilioides Pucb., and C. oculeus Temm. 

 Bonaparte gives them both in his list (Compt. Rend., 1856, p. 600) 

 and places oculeusTemm. first; from the fact, however, that he placed 

 the genus in GalUnuliiiae I think he must have had the former 

 species in view, as its bill is strikingly like that of a Gallinule. I 

 therefore, would select kilioides Puch. as the type. 



Altliougb the shape of the bill of this bird recalls the Gallinules 

 (especially Amuuroptera) it has no trace of a frontal shield, and the 

 toes are very short, as in Earyzo)ta, so that I think its place is with 

 the Rallime, though certainly an aberrant form.

 1856. — Eurxjzona Bonap., Compt. Rend., XLIII, p. 599 (type R. 

 fusciata Raffl.) 

 The question of the proper name for this genus has already 

 been thoroughly discussed. Besides the typical species allied to E. 

 fascuda, there is another which seems more nearly allied to this genus 

 than any other. This is the Cant rail ks oculeus of Temminck, which 

 is certainly not congeneric with Caniralltis klUoides (type of genus). 

 This species has the short toes of Earyzona, but has the bill some- 

 what longer and higher at the base. The coloration is almost exactly 

 the same style as that of a typical Eunjzona. Although it may be 

 necessary to propose a new genus for this species, I Avould prefer for 

 the present to place it here.

In this genus I have placed the majority of the smaller Rails, 

 which may be arranged in several subgenera: (1) Porzana with one 

 species (P. porzana). (2) Zaponiia with five distinct species (7* 

 nova'-hollandice, quadristrigata, tabiiensis, pnsilla a.nd pah(stris) and 

 several others which are perhaps only to be regarded as subspecies. 

 Additional species or subspecies may have to be recognized in this 

 group when a large amount of material is examined, but in that case 

 some of the names here included in the synonymy will have to be 

 revived. (3) Crecopsis, a group of African species, including P. 

 marginalis Peters and some allied forms. (4) Coturnicops, includ- 

 ing two species P. exquisita and P. ayresi. The type of this 

 subgenus is P. novehoracensis Gm., an American species. 



The other species of Porzana I have not been able to examine and 

 am uncertain as to their arrangement. P. akool, modesta and bicoJor 

 seem from the descriptions to be very different birds from the other 

 Porzanae and may have to be placed in a distinct genus. P. moluc- 

 cana of Wallace may not be a Porzana at all, as the description is 

 too meagre to show what its relationship really is. P. rujigenis des- 

 cribed at the same time seems to be a Euryzona.

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE MAMMALOGY OF FLORIDA. 

 BY SAMUEL N. RHOADS. 



During the past two years the writer has receiv^ed from Mr. W. S. 

 Dickinson, of Tarpon Springs, Hillsborough Co., Florida, a con- 

 siderable series of the mammals inhabiting that vicinity. A recent 

 study of these has developed facts of sufficient interest to warrant 

 publication. 



Tarpon Springs lies A\dthin a few miles of the Gulf of Mexico, near 

 the Anclote River, in a region typical of a large part of the southern 

 half of the State. The country is level, very sandy, well shaded 

 with lakes and ' ' hammocks ' ' and, o^nng to its proximity to the 

 Gulf, combines inland and maritime zoological features within a com- 

 paritively small compass. The region in question lies just to the north 

 of Tampa Bay, which may be said to define the northern extension 

 of the typically Floridian fauna along the Gulf Coast. The follow- 

 ing notes would seem to confirm the intermediate faunal position of 

 Tarpon Springs between a Louisianian and Floridian environment. 

 There is, however, an indication of geographic variation from forms 

 typical of northern and eastern parts of the State, which shows a 

 closer alliance among the mammals of Tarpon Springs with those of the 

 more southern districts. 



The only important faunal paper specially relating to the mam- 

 malogy of Florida is that of Dr. J. A. Allen in the Bulletin of the 

 Museum of Comparative Zoology, Vol. II, p. 168-185. 



I follow Dr. Allen's sequence of orders, genera and species. 



1. Putorius peninsulae Rlioads, sp. nov. Type, No. 1515, ad. 9 , coL of 

 S. N. Rlioads; "Hudson's," Pasco Co., Florida; col. by W. S. Dickinson, 

 Feb. 1894. 



Description. — Size greater than average P. erminea from the Mid- 

 dle States ; relative breadth of coloration of lower and upper parts 

 as in P. freriatii.-< ; color pattern of feet, legs and face nearest P. xan- 

 thogenys; pilosity of foot- pads and ears nearest to P. frenatus; colors 

 and length of tail and whiskers as in P. erminea; pelage scjint, 

 coarse and shorter than in any weasel examined ; skull nearest P. 

 erminea, but differing more markedly from either than P. erminea 

 from P. xanthogenys. 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELrHIA. 153 



Above, including tail, top of head, upper arm and hind thighs to 

 middle of feet, light liver-brown of nearly the same shade as seen in 

 fall specimens of erminea from Pennsylvania. Below, including in- 

 side of hind legs, distal half of hind feet, posterior two-thirds of 

 forelegs, and all of forefeet, pale yellowish white. Muzzle, below 

 margins of upper lips, an irregular patch above, but not reaching 

 nose, an irregular streak half-way between nose and eyes and reach- 

 ing behind anterior corner of eye, an ascending streak broadly 

 rising on cheek and narrowing forward to just over eyes and not con- 

 necting with nose patch, also a short median streak between ears, pure 

 white. A sparse patch of long bristling white hairs guards the open- 

 ing of the ear. Two- thirds of the tail colored like the back, distal 

 third, black. Tail two-fifths of length of body, very slender, sparsely 

 haired, the terminal pencil short. 



Skull. — (Post-palatal and post- frontal regions missing) intermediate 

 in general configuration between freiKitu.^' and xaDtJiogeuyi^ ; in size 

 very near the latter. Mandibles very massive and short ; dentition 

 also massive and crowded. The sudden post-orbital expansion of an- 

 terior portion of brain- case indicates that part to be relatively larger 

 and more inflated than in any other of our weasels, resembling most in 

 this character, erminea. Inner lobe of last upper molar slightly nar- 

 rower transversely than outer lobe, the tooth .standing at an oblique 

 ani^le to the lonn-itudinal diameter of the skull; in all the allied forms 

 these proportions are reversed and the last molar is at right angles to 

 this diameter. In x(uithogeny>i the inner lobe is often twice the dia- 

 meter of the outer lobe. In pevinxulfe the longest diameter of the 

 first upper molar is at an angle of 45 with that of the second molar 

 and at rifjht angles with that ot the premolar ; in the other species 

 the first and second molar diameters are generally in the same line, 

 never departing from it more than 15° and this diameter of the pre- 

 molar is never deflected from that of first molar more than 20° in 

 freitatu.'< and ennhiea, nor more than 45° in xaiUhogcni/s. 



While the skull of peninsnloi is one-third smaller than that oi' fre- 

 natii.i of same age, the upper first and second molars are as large as 

 those of ' largest //ez/^/^'N and absolutely stouter. Upper and lower 

 canines short and stout, the lower so massive basally as to crowd the 

 incisors into a double row, the second incisor of each mandible being 

 forced back of the other four, wiiich form a .solid anterior row 

 unbroken by the usual crowding forwanl of tlie second incisor be- 




154 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



tween the fii-st and third, seen in all other species of the MuselidcE. 

 There is no symphysis betAveen lower canines and first premolars, the 

 latter over-lying the former in penin.mke and the second lower molar 

 is relatively as large as in the upper series. Viewed laterally, the 

 mandibles of penitisidie describe a nearly perfect half ring due to the 

 great outer convexity of the ramus, its rounded, compressed angle 

 a'nd abrupt upward anterior curve. The ramus is also very thick 

 (laterally) for its width (perpendicularly), the former dimension at 

 the base of second molar is greater than that of largest freuatus while 

 the latter dimension is one-third less. In peninsuloe the width (hori- 

 zontal) of the articular process of mandible is relatively much less 

 than we find it in freuatus and xanihogenys, in this approaching er- 

 minea, but it is, as in other parts, relatively stouter than in any of 

 them. 



Measurements^ (from stuffed skin) : — Total length, 375; tail verte- 

 brae (vertebrse remaining in skin), 100; hind foot, 40; pencil, 16. 



SkuU — Posterior base of incisors to post-palatal notch, 18.7; length 

 of nasals, 9; interorbital constriction, 10.7; articular process of man- 

 dible to anterior base of incisor, 26 ; height of coronoid process from 

 angle, 12. 



My examination of the skulls of the above mentioned species 

 makes it apparent, not only that the Florida animal is distinct from 

 its allies in the United States, but that xanihogenys should be classed 

 as a good species, separable from frenatus not only in external but 

 in cranial characters. The relationships between /re^;«f».s- and ^r«- 

 siliensis, of which some authors make it a sub-species, I am unable 

 to discuss, from lack of material. Xanihogenys, in addition to its 

 constant and well known color differences, may be cranially separated 

 i'rom frenatus of same age by the decidedly and constantly smaller 

 size, the relative shalloAvness and flatness, the greater relative width 

 to length and the sudden constriction of the skull behind the supra- 

 orbital processes. The pterygoid fossa is also relatively shorter and 

 both absolutely and relatively wider than in frenatus. The length of 

 largest //ey/ttifw skulls is 54, while that of the largest xanthogenys 

 is 46. 



A stuffed specimen of this new weasel was sent by ]\Ir. Dickinson in 

 February, 1894. So far as can be determined, tliis is the first instance 



^ All measurements in millimeters.

on record of such an animal from Florida. Fortunately, the anterior 

 half of the skull, including the perfect jaws, were within and at- 

 tached to the skin. These were extracted and confirmed my suspic- 

 ions, excited by the peculiar external characters, that the animal was 

 a nondescript. As will be seen in the diagnosis, it combines 

 the characteristic color-pattern of the P. bradliensis group 

 with the colors and relative measurements of the enninea group. 

 This weasel was captured in the woods by a cat, in Pasco County, 

 Florida, at " Hudson's," 14 miles north of Tarpon Springs.

 have been sent. The latter, large and prime, bring little over five 

 dollars in the Philadelphia market, owing to the scant pelage. The 

 average color is even darker and more glossy than in the highly 

 prized pelts from the northwestern States. 



3. Procyon lotor (Linn.). Eaccoon. 



A large series of furs, skins and skulls of this abundant animal 

 have passed through my hands. They show the Florida coon to 

 be when young, almost exactly the same color as average adults 

 from the Middle States. As they increase in age a strong suffusion 

 of orange brown becomes pronounced on the back, rump and tail. 



In Dr. Allen's paper (sup. cit, p. 170) P. hernandezii is made 

 a synonym of Intor. An exceptionally large series of skulls from 

 Florida, the JNIiddle States and the Northwest shows the following 

 specific differences, based on six typical adult specimens of each 

 series. 



In hernandezii there is no ridged occipital crest, generally present 

 in older examples of lot or ; the mandibles are heavier and stouter, 

 more widely separated to accommodate the great width of brain case, 

 and broader between the canines; in length they are the same as in 

 lotor. The angle is more produced, narrow and angular in hernandezii, 

 the upper molar series very wide for their length and decidedly

trian<rulai-, in lotor the molars are quite symmetrically rounded. 

 The premolars in the former are large, strongly rooted and always 

 present, in lotor they are relatively smaller and the first premolar 

 often crowded out. Auditory meatus of hernaudezii produced like 

 the neck of a flask, making transverse diameter of bullte much greater 

 than the longitudinal, in lotor these diameters are equal. In lotor the 

 median attenuation of the zygomatic arch is decided, narrow and semi- 

 cylindrical ; in hernandezii it is slight, the malar being broad and 

 strap- like. A strong and constant difference between Pacific and At- 

 lantic Coast specimens is the much greater relative size of the brain 

 and brain-case in the former, especially in the anterior breadth and 

 greater depth. This feature causes a specific difference in the upper 

 cranial profile; in hernandezii there is a gentle continuous rise from 

 nasals to the fronto- parietal suture or even farther back, in lotor this 

 ascent is more abrupt to the interorbital region, which is tumid, fol 

 lowed by a depression and rising again, giving the skull an undulat- 

 ing profile. 



The characters given by Prof Cope (Amer. Nat., Feb., 1889, pp. 

 141-142), as distinguishing lotor from hernandezii I do not find of as 

 constant value as those above given, except those relating to the latter 

 species near the bottom of page 142, notably the greater prominence 

 of the post-orbital processes of the malar and frontal bones. 



4. ? Atalapha borealis - pfeifferi (Gundlach). Florida Red Bat. 



All the specimens of this bat sent from Tarpon Springs, as well as 

 those whi'^h I have examined from other parts of the State, are uni- 

 formly of the " deep cherry red" spoken of by Dr. J. A. Allen 

 {sup. cit, p. 173). Dr. Harrison Allen (Mon. Bats. N. Amer., 

 1893, p. 146) notices the same peculiarity and refers them question- 

 ably to A. pfeifferi Gundlach, (Monatsb. K, B. Akad., Berlin., 

 1861, p. 152). 



Dr. Gundlach's description, which is full, seems to answer for this 

 form very well, except that he states the roots of the hairs are gray, 

 whereas in Florida specimens tlie roots are black. The color of 

 pfeifferi is said to be cinnamon red in the male and cinnamon brown 

 in the female. I have been unable to secure specimens of the Cuban 

 form for comparison, so refer the Floridian variety to it for the pres-

 much coarser, having the appearance of spun glass ; the terminal 

 fourth of hairs silvery brown, basal three- fourths plumbeous; chest, 

 wrists, muzzle and upper head orange brown, darkening posteriorly,

 In aqnaiicH)> the last three molars average as wide as long, \i\ jMrvux 

 much wider than long, owdng to the greater relative intrusion of their 

 inner anterior cusps. In aqnatlcus the first premolar, owing to sudden 

 constriction of the rostrum at that point, is thrown within the line con- 

 necting the canine and second premolar ; in jjartiits these three teeth are 

 in regular file. Mandil)ular dentition in parvus relatively wider for 

 length tiiroughout, aud the outline of teeth more angular than in ((^((o- 

 ticus; the hinder section of last molar in parvus is less than half the 

 width of anterior section; in aqitaticus the sections of this tooth are of 

 etiual width and its greatest length exceeds considerably its greatest 

 width, while in parvus the transverse diameter equals the longitudinal. 

 In the latter the mandibular ramus, as in the case of Putoriiis penin- 

 suke, while much shorter, is absolutely heavier aud wider. 



There is a strong projecting shoulder at the anterior base of coronoid 

 process in parvus not seen in aqaatieus, and the accessory posterior spur 

 just below tip of coronoid process in the latter is not present in the 

 former. The measurements are as follows : — 



One specimen of this genus has been I'eceived from Mr. Dickinson.

11. Sciurus niger Linn. Southern Fox Squirrel. 



All of the thirteen specimens received are remarkably uniform in 

 color for so variable a species, being of the light gray type, witli 

 black crown, white ears and nose patch and tawny underparts. One 

 short tailed specimen is blacker on feet and legs, the belly rusty.

Thirty specimens of all ages do not present the plumbeous color 

 variations so strongly marked in G. burmrius (Shaw). They are not 

 as variable as a like series of Sitomys americauux, such differences as 

 appear being due to ordinary results of age and season. One very 

 large, old male is uniform bright rusty above and hoary fulvous be- 

 neath. The rest are darker, the rusty mainly confined to sides, with 

 a duskier dorsal stripe aud hoary plumbeous belly. The naked yel- 

 lowish tail invariably has a mahogany- colored tip and averages half 

 the length of head aud body. Some females, apparently only half 

 grown, were nursing young.

With exception of the Norway Rat these old-world species are 

 very abundant. 



18. Sitomys americanus gossypinus (Le Conte). Pine-woods Deer Mouse. 

 A series of thirty Tarjjon Springs specimens show no mentionable 



differences from those of northern Florida. Two skins have a pre- 

 vailing dark sooty suffusion of the under parts which at first sight 

 would indicate a specific difference, but it is probably due to their 

 residence in a recently burnt clearing. In young specimens the gray 

 is more hoary above than in typical americunuK and the underi>arls 

 are more plumbeous, lacking almost entirely the pure white of lower 

 head and neck seen in young americanus.

160 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



Specimens of a small white-footed mouse, which are at present re- 

 ferred provisionally to this race, were received from Tarpon Springs 

 a few days before the issue of Mr. Chapman's paper on .mbgriaeus. 

 These were sent to Mr. Chapman for comparison and he jironounced 

 them intermediate between niveiventrix and suhgri.<eHS. Additional 

 specimens, making in all seventeen, have since been received. A 

 comparison of these AAnth Mr. Chapman's rather brief diagnosis shows 

 them to differ from nlvelventrU in their smaller size; from ^ubgriseus 

 in the uniform whiteness of the belly hairs to their roots, and from 

 both forms in their uni-colored and nearly naked tails, which strik- 

 ingly resemble those of Geomys tuza. OAving to my inability to 

 secure a loan of the type series in the possession of the American 

 Museum, a critical comparison of these differences cannot now be 

 made. They appear, however, to represent at least a sub- specific 

 variation, and a study of the cranial measurements strongly supports 

 this view. 



Mr. Dickinson writes me that these mice "were taken in a culti- 

 vated field near the head of Anclote River, in Pasco County. They 

 make a burrow from two to three feet long and ten to eighteen inches 

 deep, at the bottom of which is found the nest. They also have a 

 second passage through which to escape from their enemies in case of 

 pursuit; the outlet of this is hidden, apparently lacking three-quar- 

 ters of an inch of penetrating the surface of the ground. When a 

 switch is inserted they push through this secret outlet and often escape. 

 In captivity they are cannibals." 



20. Oryzomys palustris natator Chapman. Florida Rice-field Mouse. 

 One specimen sent. A series of this form from the Gulf Coast 



would be of interest to compare with those of northern Florida and 

 Texas, but I have been unal)le to secure them. 



21. Sigmodon hispidus littoralis» (?) Chapman. Florida Cotton Eat. 



Of the five specimens of Cotton Rat (three adults, two young) 

 sent from Tarpon Springs, two very old individuals are strikingly 

 different from typical hhpkln^ and are evidently similar to the " No.

 description of /t7<o?-afe as being much grayer than the Gainesville

In hispidus the ratio of total length to zygomatic width is hivf) in

A later specimen from Mr. Dickinson is very similar in every fea- 

 ture to typical hispidus from North Carolina, being browner than 

 typical littoralis and quite as small, though nearly adult.. The receipt 

 of this specimen has induced me to defer separating the southwestern 

 form until a large series is at my disposal from this region. These 

 two gray Cotton Rats from Tarpon Springs are either abnormally 

 large and the small one abnormally brown, or else there are two 

 species, the smaller, true hispidits, the larger, unnamed. Such a con- 

 dition of affairs is not impossible, the former being an inhabitant of 

 the inland fresh water marshes, the latter frequenting the maritime 

 sli(»res.

One specimen received. I do not find any record of this mouse 

 from Florida. The specimen, if characteristic of the form inhabiting 

 southern Florida, represents a race as different from the northern 

 type as other of the Florida Muridie. 



The specimen, while apparently full grown, is not fully adult and, 

 in the hope of securing more specimens, further description is now 

 deferred.

CONTRIBUTIONS TO LIFE HISTORIES OF PLANTS, NO XI. 



by thomas meehan. 



On the Morphology of Bractless Inflorescence. 



In various papers I have given illustrations to demonstrate that the 

 variety of iuflorescence known as extra- axillary results from the 

 sudden arrestation of a growing shoot, and the immediate growth of 

 the axillary hud, which pushes aside to a lateral position the former 

 leader and effectually takes its place, only to be itself pushed aside 

 by another developing axillary bud, when the proper time for that 

 development has arrived. 



Although this explanation is fully satisfactory so far as bracteated 

 inflorescence is concerned, it does not explain the morphology of the 

 naked flowered class, the exact nature of which has never been de- 

 termined, and which, hitherto, I have never lieen able to understand. 



One has only to read the chapter on "Inflorescence " in "Sach's 

 Text Book " (English edition, p. 519 and following) to learn how con- 

 fused and unphilosophical are prevailing notions concerning the na- 

 ture of the various forms of iuflorescence. That " Boraginacese 

 and Solanacece" present an inflorescence determined by " the re- 

 peated dichotomy of an axillary bud," is better expressed by my 

 proposition that it is determined by " the assumption of leadership by 

 the axillaiy growth ;" but though it is clear to Sachs that "the 

 ultimate floral axes or pedicels of the flowers" are " not axillary 

 in Aroidese, Cruciferaj, &c.," he still insists "that every iufloi*- 

 escence originates from the normal terminal branching of a growing 

 axis." " If bracts are conspicuously developed, the lateral axes 

 arise in their axils ; if they are inconspicuous or abortive, the lateral 

 axes of the inflorescence are not axillary, but their mode of branch- 

 ing and growth remain the same as if the bracts were present." 

 Though long satisfied that this diagnosis of naked iuflorescence was 

 wrong, and that there never had been theoretical bracts to abort, I 

 have not, until now, been able to perceive that inflorescence is not all 

 constructed on one plan ; and that naked inflorescence, in particular, 

 does not need the theoretical conception of bracts and axillary buds 

 to account for its character. 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHII.ADEl.PHIA. 163 



In Saxifragacete nidst species are characterized by bracteated in- 

 florescence, but there is a small section, of which Saxifraga crassifolia 

 is the type, which has naked cymes. With one species of this sec- 

 tion before me, S. cordata, it was evident that so wide a departure 

 from the rest of its family could not be explained by any conception 

 of axillary branching, such as a bracteated character involves. 

 Abortion of the bracts could not by any possibility, have occurred. 

 Neither could my own proposition of the pushing aside of a terminal 

 axis by the growth of an axillary bud have any place in this 

 arrangement. After many days of observation, thought, and com- 

 parison, the manner in which the inflorescence was formed became 

 so clear, that the only surprise was that it had taken so many years 

 to discover it. 



The inflorescence of these Saxifrages is formed simply by the 

 elongation of the petioles and coalition of the stipules ; the branchlets 

 and the flowers, xvith their pedicels, are modifications of the leaj- blade; 

 the veins forming the pedicels, and the flowers proceediiig from buds 

 formed at the apex of these veins. 



It is not necessary to go into close details, as the suggestion once 

 given, anyone with one or several plants before him can see that this 

 is the fact. The bud scale, enclosing the embryonic flower scape is 

 the enlai-ged and dilated base of a leaf, which, at the end of the past 

 growing season, develo})ed so far only as to form this scale. When 

 the growing season arrives, this scale is rejuvenated, and increases a 

 little in size, but the next one to elongate is perhaps double the length, 

 with no increase in width. The next is still longer and narrower, 

 with an imperfect leaf l)lade just beneath the apex. The perfect leaf 

 blade at length ensues, with a still greater elongation of the dilated 

 Inise, which we might now almost call the stipular portion. The 

 next following has an inch, or sometimes more, of a petiole between 

 the apex of this stipular portion and the leaf blade, still, however, 

 with the apex of what would have been a bud-scale, ap[)arent. It is 

 important to note this projection as furnishing the key to what f(»l- 

 lows. The flower stem now pushes np, wholly leafless, but as the 

 lower branchlet of the cymose inflorescence develops, we see the 

 apex before noted in the axis, and by further observation iiiny trace 

 on one side of the main stalk, a ridge evidently foiineil i)y the over- 

 lapping outer edge of the coiled stipule. Succeeding branchleta 




1()4 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



show, but in a le^is degree, the same arraugeiueut. The uumei'ical 

 order of the secondary branchlets of the inflorescence, and their 

 general divergence and arrangement, correspond well with the main 

 ])ranchlets of the veins in the leaves, leaving no doubt in the mind 

 of the thoughtful observer of their morphological identity. 



Taking a glance at what occurs in other plants there is analogy 

 for the view here taken. Some Begonias form leaf-buds at the 

 end of their leading veinlets, as do many ferns; and a well known 

 plant in cultivation, Bryophyllum calydnum, is increased mainly by 

 such buds. Morphologically there is no difference between a leaf- 

 bud and a flower- bud, so that we may reasonably expect flowers to 

 appear where leaf-buds may exist. And in other respects Bryo- 

 phyllutn fortifies the position assumed for the Saxifrage. The leaves 

 appearing at an early stage of growth are entire, and formed mucli 

 as we find them in Saxifraga cordata but as the flowering stem pro- 

 gresses towards the flowering stage, the newer leaves become divided, 

 and trifoliate — that is to say, the veins are comparatively destitute of 

 their normal cellular covering, and are on their way to become the 

 pedicels we find in the inflorescence of the Saxifrage. 



I may conclude by reaffirming the proposition already presented, 

 that nature does not depend on one melhod only as a plan for the 

 formation of inflorescence ; that in Saxifraga cordata, and proba])ly 

 in bractless inflorescence generally, the elongation and coiling of 

 stipules or the dilated bases of leaf- stalks form the main axis or stem ; 

 and the leaf- blade the branches, branchlets and flowers. 



On Purple-Leaved Plants. 



A large number of plants occasionally pi-oduce individuals with 

 reddish or purple leaves. These are propagated by nurserymen, 

 and are known in gardens as " blood- leaved " trees and shrubs. 

 Thus we have blood-leaved oak, sycamore, beech, barberry and 

 many others. Perpetuated by grafting, these retain the blood- 

 leaved character through life, no variation from this characteristic 

 having been placed on record. 



No attempt to explain this eccentricity seen)s to have been made. 

 It is well to place together facts that may ultimately lead to an ex- 

 planation. 



In ilower paintings the leaves and vegetative parts of plants are

usually represented of a uniform tint of green, liut the real artist 

 will tell us that there is seldom lacking a shade of brown or purple 

 in some portions of leaves and branches that are in the highest con- 

 ditions of vigor. The stronger growing shoots of the well-known 

 Pyrns japouica are always of a bright rosy brown, only in those 

 shoots grooving in the interior of the plant, in partial shade, is the 

 brown tint wanting. In the blood-leaved beech, the interior half- 

 starved leaves have little of the brown, and the more vigorous the 

 exposed branches are, the deeper is the shade. Blood- leaved trees 

 themselves are, on the whole, more vigorous than the normal green- 

 leaved forms from which, in the language of the nurseryman, they 

 originally "sported." There is little doubt that in some unknown 

 way, a vigorous vital power is accountable for the blood-leaved char- 

 acter in these cases. 



A remarkable variation in the blood-leaved form of the common 

 white birch has recently occurred. Some twelve years ago, a small 

 plant was received from Franc(>. Some half a dozen were raised 

 from it by grafting on a closely allied species, Betnla pnpulifolia. 

 From the ends of some of the lowermost branches in two of these 

 trees branchlets with the ordinary foliage of Betnla aJIxi have ap- 

 peared. The dark "red" or purplish brown color of the leaves 

 pervades the bark as well. In the reversion instanced not only the 

 leaves but the branches have 

 assumed the normal green. It 

 is interesting to note that the 

 reversion is not completed at 

 once. The dark color first 

 seems wanting in limited por- 

 tions of the l)ark as the growth 

 proceeds. At times the green 

 part widens, then again lessens 

 in length and width. In one 

 case the dark portion extends 

 as a hair line for four inches 

 upwardly before it finally dis- 

 appears. In one ca.se half the 

 leaf is purple, the other half 

 green. Tliere is no gradual shading oil (dthi- green Mini llie lnown, 




166 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



but the Hues are distinctly drawu where one tint ends and the other 

 begins. 



When these plants were grafted originally, one of the grafts one year 

 old was broken completely off. The stock pushed out a branch of the 

 blood- leaved form at a considerable distance down from the poin*^ 

 at which the graft had been inserted, a note of which was made at 

 the time in the "Botanical Gazette." This branch was of the same 

 species as the parent, Betula alba, and not Betula populifnUa, the 

 stock. 



We may conclude from these observations, that whatever the law 

 may be which induces this change of color from the normal green to 

 the blood-leaved condition, the change is effected in an original single 

 cell or nucleus of the seed, and that the subsequent cells carry 

 along the peculiarity of the mother cell through the whole life of the 

 tree. It is further evident that it is an additional character, and not 

 a change, as when the cell parts with it, as in the case of the birch 

 cited, growth goes on just as before. In the case of the branch 

 coming out below the point of union with the stock, we learn that 

 the reproduction of daughter cells from a mother cell can take place 

 downwardly as well as in other directions, and that huds and branches 

 can he produced from an original cell. There is no distinction in 

 nature between an axis and a leaf. They can both originate when 

 the conditions favor, from a single cell, in any part of the plant. 



On the Origin of the Apical Cell. 



When treating of plant-tissues much has been said of the puncfinii 

 vegetation is, and the necessity of a pre-existing apical cell before a 

 branch can be formed. It does not seem to be conceded that any cell 

 may, in an early stage of existence, produce a separate apical cell, 

 capable of becoming the parent of a branch, whenever the exigencies 

 of the plant require it. But I have had abundant evidence that 

 the primary meristem or cambium tissue can, in emergencies, easily 

 l)roduce apical cells from Avhich buds and branches can proceed. I 

 have seen numerous cases of horse chestnuts, ^-J'Jscidu.-^ Hippoeas- 

 tanum, Osage orange, Maclura aurantiaca, and Cottonwood, Populus 

 monllifera, cut down in the winter time, that made buds and branches 

 from the cambium tissue formed the preceding year, along the 

 whole circumference of the ti*ee stump. Hundreds of cells from 




1894] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 167 



this tissue would attempt to form shoots, many naturally being 

 crowded out, but enough finally making a growth to present a minia- 

 ture forest. The most remarkable case of this nature came under 

 ray observation in 1898, and relates to two large Carolina Cotton- 

 woods, Populus monilifem, standing on the sidewalk at the corner 

 of Greene and Harvey Streets, Gerraantown, About the time of the 

 unfolding of the leaf, a horse had gnawed away the bark, exposing 

 the wood for a space of nearly a foot in diameter. About midsum- 

 mer, when the new cambium layer was being formed,' hundreds of 

 buds developing to leaves and branches, appeared from the edge of 

 the whole exposed surface of the new layer. It was a remarkable 

 sight that a layer of tissue, usually content to cover a wound with 

 new wood, should at the same time seem to be covered with scores of 

 what one would call seedling trees if they had been at the surface 

 of the earth. 



It must be well known to observers of trees which have had large 

 branches sawn off, that numerous buds producing branches will push 

 through the bark of the stump near where the upper portion was cut 

 away, proceeding, of course, from the primary meristem tissue which 

 must have had the power to produce the necessary apical cells tor 

 this bud formation. But it is not often that the same power can be 

 evidenced by similar growths from the exposed portions of wounds, 

 as the observations here recorded afford. 



The Fall of the Leaf in the Holly. 



Near Philadelphia tlie spring growth of the American Holly, 

 I/e.v opacd, occurs in May. Simultaneously with the appearance of 

 the new growth the ground is strewed with fallen leaves. I have 

 thought, in common with most, if not all observers, tluit the swelling 

 of the new growth dislodged the old leaves, just as it seems to do in 

 the case of oak or beech leaves, where leaves that happen to remain 

 dry on the branches all winter, drop when the new growth occurs in 

 spring. To my surprise I find that this is not the case in the holly. 

 After the copious fall already referred to, it is found that most of 

 the fallen leaves were those of last year. Two-year-old leaves on 



n have shown ill tlu' ProceiMliiiKS of the Acidriny. istid, pp. ;.'{)2--2!«, that it

168 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



the tree are abundant. Some of these are among the fallen ones, 

 but few, apparently, in proportion to those from among the last 

 season's growth. There is no fixed order in the dropping of the 

 leaves. On a branch with say ten last year's leaves, it may be the 

 first, fourth or fifth in tlie order of growth, or it may be a few of the 

 later ones. In some cases all of the last year's growth will fall 

 from the branch, leaving a few healthy leaves below of the year 

 previous to the last. These will probably fall in a natural manner 

 later in the season. 



Just here arises the question: What is the " natural manner " of 

 the fall of the leaf? If a branch of any tree be broken off before 

 maturity, the leaves dry, but remain attached to the parent branch. 

 There is no "fall of the leaf" in this case. On the same branch, 

 if it had been lefl on the parent stem, the leaf would have formed 

 cork cells at the junction of petiole and stem, and have fallen by mere 

 disarticulation at that point, in due season. Histology has taught 

 us that cork cells are differentiated from other tissue, but the man- 

 ner in which this has been brought about has not been demonstrated 

 so fiar as the writer is aware. It has been thought that the following 

 observations in connection ^nth this subject may at least direct 

 thought, if they throw little direct light on the subject. 



On the leaves of the holly which are to fall, one or more small, 

 black blotches underneath the epiderm appear here and there, being 

 apparent both on the upper and under surface of these leaves. At 

 this season the parenchyma takes on a yellow cast, the black 

 blotches, however, retaining their character. Disarticulation then 

 follows. The leaves which are perfectly green, and with no dark 

 blotches on them, continue on the stem. The connection between 

 these blotches and the fall of the leaf is undoubted, and we may 

 almost as logically say they are connected with the formation of the 

 cork cells wdiich act directly in disarticulation. 



Those of us who have had a wide experience with living vegetation 

 have no difficulty in surmising that these dark blotches are of a 

 fungous character. My good friend, the eminent mycologist, Mr. J. 

 B. Ellis, of Newfield, New Jersey, after a microscopic examination 

 of these fallen leaves, finds evidence that the marks are caused by 

 a minute fungus, though in this and similar instances he has never 

 been able to get nearer the fact than that they are manifestations of

some zymotic organism that permeates the whole structure of the 

 individual during its progressive growth. 



I have, in other papers, shown that the bark of trees is not 

 decorticated in any mechanical way, but by the growth of cork 

 cells, each species having its own time and manner of development. 

 In some trees these cells become active on bark but one or two years 

 old, while in the chestnut, Cmtanea, and some others it may be 

 twenty or more years before any sign of a "rough" bark appears, 

 through the quiescence of the cork cells. No one, as I havealreadv 

 hinted, seems to have l)eeu able to demonstrate the causes which 

 lead to these varying and remarkable results. 



In the case of these holly leaves it is evident that they do not fall 

 in response to the requirements of any definite period of maturity, 

 hut that the cork cells which provide for disarticulation are simul- 

 taneous with the destruction of the parenchyma. This is apparently 

 the work of an adventitious agency, not essential to, but in some way 

 co-ordinate with the regular economy of the plant. 



On Bees and Honey-suckles. 



I was interested to-day, June 18th, in noting that while a few 

 honey bees persistently collected nectar from the mouths of honey- 

 suckles, by far the larger number collected from the fallen flowers 

 only. 



The plant was Lonicera japouica, in the two forms known in 

 gardens as L. hrachypoda, and L. flexuosa, both intertwining and 

 flowering together. I have, in the pjist, satisfied myself that a bee 

 which starts from the hive for pollen pays no attention to gathering 

 nectar, while the one looking for nectar collects that only. Whether 

 this is the course of labor for that trip from the hive only,or whether 

 these ))articular tasks occupy the whole day or more, may be an in- 

 teresting (juestion. I had never noted bees collecting nectar from 

 fallen flowers; indeed had not noted that fallen flowers had nectar, 

 so that the attention of the bees to them gave the subject a double 

 interest. 



The flowers are white when freshly opened, the next day yellowish, 

 the following they wither slightly and fall. Large numbers are col- 

 lected by the leaves on which they mostly lie till they turn brown 

 and shrivel completely. Those which were badly shrivelleil seemed 

 preferable to the i)ees. 




170 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



On cutting across the tube of a white corolla near the base, and 

 then gently stripping the flower downwardly a large globule of nec- 

 tar protrudes. The same process executed on the older or yellow 

 flower, gives about the same quantity as also does the faded flower 

 of the tliird day. In the dried flower, taken before much shrivelling 

 had occurred, nearly as much nectar was found. The completely 

 shrivelled and twisted flower could not be "stripped" of itr^ secre- 

 tion in this way, but it was certainly present and as abundant. The 

 bees carefully sought what would have been the mouth of the corolla, 

 and then extracted the sweets from that point. It soon became evi- 

 dent that the shrivelling and contracting of the tube of the corolla 

 acted in the same manner as the thumb-nail and finger in "stripping," 

 lessening the diameter of the tul)e, and forcing the nectar towards the 

 mouth, and within the reach of the visiting insect. 



As noted, the bees collecting nectar from these dead flowers, never 

 visited the fresh opening ones; while the few visiting the fresh 

 flowers never visited the dead or dying ones; a very careful watch of 

 half an hour satisfied me on this point. It was noted that the latter 

 took considerable time and much labored effort with each flower. 

 There was an average of fifteen seconds to each flower, a very long 

 time for the average honey-making bee. Those working on the dry- 

 ing flowers made no more than the ordinary effort of bees with fresh 

 flowers. It was difficult to understand why in the same variety of 

 insect should each have its own line of procedure. If it should be 

 suggested that bees could profit by experience, and that those which 

 confined themselves to the freshly opened flowers were young bees 

 that had yet much to learn, there still remains the fact that they did 

 not profit by the experience of the older bees. Sometimes almost 

 side by side, it might be supposed that any creature that could profit 

 by experience, would want to know what the one picking at a dried 

 flower had found. 



The relation between insects and flowers obtrudes itself here. 

 Many plants, as I have placed on record, shed their pollen and cover 

 the stigma before the opening of the corolla. "Whether the stigma is 

 in receptive condition or not, the pollen remains there till it is, and we 

 may regard all such as "arranged for self-fertilization," if, indeed, 

 there is any such special arrangement in the vegetable world wholly 

 with this view, or with the special view of cross-fertilization. But in 

 tiiis honey-suckle the anther sacs burst immediately on expansion and

the iintliers are in such close position to the stigma tliat it can scarcely 

 do auiilit but receive its own-pollen. All the flowei's examined 

 seemed to have the stigmas completely covered with pollen, and I 

 feel pretty sure, with own-pollen. My plants are, however, infertile, 

 rarely a few berries mature. I should refer this to propagation from 

 an infertile plant, as we frequently find to occur in all classes of lig- 

 neous plants, which fruit neither with own-pollen nor foreign pollen, 

 rather than to any want of ability in own- pollen to produce fertili- 

 zation as an abstract principle, as would be assumed by some. 



There still remains to be discussed why all this large amount of 

 nectar should be secreted by the flower with no apparent benefit to 

 itself in any conceivable way. But it is not safe to say, that, because 

 we can not see that any benefit results in relation to the visits of 

 insects, it is of no value in some, as yet, undiscovered operation in 

 the economy of nature. For auglit we know it may be an excretion 

 rather than a secretion, which it may be as much an advantage to 

 get rid of when of no further use to the plant, as it is an advantage 

 to get rid of the corolla itself. 



A very curious circumstance in connection with these observations 

 was the discovery that each of these two foims of the Lonicera 

 Japonica, have different times of the day for the opening of its blos- 

 soms. The expansion, as in so many points of growth, is rhythmic 

 and not a continuous effort. In the form known as Lonieerd jiexiioxti, 

 the lobes of the corolla parted so as to admit of the protrusion of the 

 stamens at 2 P. M. Further efforts at expansion rested till 4 P. M., 

 when the act was resumed and completed. L. In-dchijpoda com- 

 menced opening at 5 P. M., and completed the opening by 7 P. M. 



There is no reason why variation may not occur in the behaviour 

 of plants as well as in the parts of their structure, but it is difhcult to 

 conceive of any physiological value in these variations from any point 

 of view in the economy of plant life.

THE DIFFERENTIAL ACTION OF CERTAIN MUSCLES PASSING 

 MORE THAN ONE JOINT. 



BY THOMAS EAKIXS. 



It is not without diffidence, that I, a painter, venture to communi- 

 cate with a scientific body upon a scientific subject ; yet I am en- 

 couraged by thinkiug that Nature is so many sided that the humblest 

 observer may, irom his point of view, offer suggestions worthy of 

 attention. I am greatly indebted to Dr. Harrison Allen, who has 

 kindly added some explanatory notes. 



I have long been dissatisfied with the account in standard works 

 of the muscular action in animal locomotion. The muscles are clas- 

 sified principally as flexors and extensors, working and resting 

 alternately. Wishing to apply this system during my early dissec- 

 tions to the leg of the living horse, I was surprised to observe in the 

 strain of starting a horse car, that the so- called flexors and extensors 

 were in strong action at the same time. 



The classification was still farther from satisfactory when applied 

 to muscles passing over two or more joints, flexing perhaps one joint, 

 wliile extending another. In trying to understand the significance 

 of these last named muscles, I came to believe it to be very important 

 to discover if the one joint was extended more rapidly than the other 

 was flexed. This investigation demanded a consideration of the 

 amount and kind of leverage, and was extended from the muscles to 

 tendons ' which pass over the two or more joints. I next constructed 

 a model of the entire limb with flat pieces of half-inch pine board, 

 cut to the outline of the bones, the pieces pivoted together, having 

 catgut for tendons and ligaments, and rubber bands for muscles, all 

 attached to their places and properly restrained. 



I had then the satisfaction of seeing this meclianism imitate in 

 many ways the action of the real leg, and was enal>led to establish 

 two important principles, thus: First, the hoof-pieces properly set 

 upon the ground, the leg stood firm, all tendency to collapse being 

 prevented by the leverage of tendons passing joints. Secondly, the 



^Thc use of the word "tendons" in the sense here employed, does not refer to 

 the. t<'ndons in connection with muscular Ixdlics, but to ligament-like structures 

 which are homolo<;ous with the muscles as these bodies are uniformly assigned 

 l)y authors to the musculature of the limbs. H. AUeu.

tightening of tlie rubber biiiuls represeutiug nil the priacipal muscles, 

 both the so-called tlexors aud the so-called exteusoi"S, «f the sainetinie, 

 caused the upper part of the limb to spring forward when released, 

 and proved to me that I was not mistaken in my observation on the 

 living horse. 



Returning to the dead horse, I denuded both a front and back leg 

 ot every shred of muscular fibi-e, yet they sustained weight. 



There was no tendency to collapse, and an increase in the weight 

 only measured an increase of resistance. " (If one wishes to repeat 



mv experiment with the dead 

 horse and should choose the 

 front leg, he must respect the 

 large tendon concealed in the 

 biceps brachialis which might 

 escape a careless dissection, 

 especially by one accustomed 

 rather to dissections of the 

 human body. ) Observation 

 of the living horse will teach 

 us, that, if he wishes to lie 

 down, he must fii-st Hex the 

 pastern, aud the stumbling 

 horse must strike the hoof 

 with force enough to flex the 

 phalanges beft)re he can go 

 down. 



To illustrate in the simplest 

 way the scheme of the muscles 

 and tendons passing more than 

 one joint 1 pivoted one little flat stick upon two others (fig. 1), aud 

 on the horizontal sticks I drove in four pins leaving the heads pro- 

 ject slightly, the pin a close to the upper joint, the pin h farther from 

 it ; the pin d close to the lower joint, the pin <■ farther. If two in- 

 extensible strings be looped, one from a to c, the other from /> U><l, 

 the upper 'horizontal piece is held up and will sustain weight. The

a end caunot go down on ticcount of the string b d and the b end can- 

 not go down for the string a c. If ruljber bands be stretched on 

 the same pins, then the upper horizontal piece will, if released, spring 

 forward very far and very fast compared with the actual shortening 

 ot the rubbei-s (fig. 2). 



Fig. 2. 



The model of the entire limb had all the merit of a first approxi- 

 mation. It imitated pretty closely the movement of the leg itself 

 A second and closer approximation can now be had l)y considering 

 in terms of my first elements, the variations from Nature made in 

 them to gain simplicity of construction. In the first place, articular 

 surfaces are not circular, so that a pivot does not accurately represent 

 their motion. Neither do bones moving in constraint, one against 

 the other, keep in the same plane, but their axes describe warped 

 surfaces from the helical character of the articulations. 



There is a constant change in the relative rates of motion of the 

 joints, involving likewise a constant change in the relative leverage. 



The problem becomes instantly one of extreme difficulty, yet a fair 

 appreciation may be obtained. 



The leg should be studied in several positions not consecutive, but 

 so far apart as to cause decided changes in the relative rates of the 

 different levers, and so small a part of the path or trajectory should 

 be considered, that a simple curve or straight line may, without 

 error, ])e substituted as in the manner of studying evolutes.

tendons which suffice to hold uj) the entire weight of the Iior.se, and 

 which, by their leverage in conjunction with the shapes of the 

 articular surfaces of the joints, determine the trajectory of the horse's 

 HKU'enieut. (It seems likely that in the long run it was the trajectory 

 which determined the length and position of the tendons and the 

 shapes of the surfaces.) 



In the diagram of the fnmt leg I wouhl like to call attention to 

 the humerus having its upper joint, the one with the .scapula, well 

 back; while its lower joint, with the radius, lies well forward. Tiu' 




176 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



great teiidou running through the front part of the biceps brachialis 

 has a very short leverage below and a long one above/ 



In the hind leg you will notice that the feraora-tibial joint is well 

 back, while the astragalo- tibial joint is well forward, and the tendon 

 in front of the tibia takes a longer leverage above than below, with 

 this condition reversed in the two tendons behind the tibia. 



When a horse stands in his usual position, the tendons which I 

 have drawn sustain his weight in stable equilibrium, because his cen- 

 tre of gravity is at the lowest point of its trajectory. 



The upper end of the dissected leg weighted heavily and moved 

 backward and forward in the vicinity of the standing position, will 

 there describe as a trajectory a flattish curve with its concavity up- 

 wards. At the lowest point of this concavity the leg settles when 

 the horse ceases his muscular effort and simply stands. Any mus- 

 cular effort that the horse may make from the standing position be- 

 gins by raising himself (A horse may, and often does, especially in 

 haunching himself, maintain his weight at a still higher point be- 

 hind by raising himself and slipping his patella over the inner troch- 

 lear surface of the femur, where it locks itself, and the weight of the 

 trunk is again sustained without muscular effort. To unlock the pa- 

 tella traction is made by the tensor vaginae femoris). 



To investigate the action of a muscle I believe it necessary to 

 consider it, not only with reference to the levers to which it is at- 

 tached, but with relation to the whole movement of the animal. 

 Then it will be seen that many muscles rated in the books as antago- 

 nistic, are no more so than are two parts of the same muscle. As an 

 example, let us take the gastrocnemius. It is a short muscle, and 

 takes its origin above the knee, and is inserted by means of a long 

 tendon (the tendo Achillis) into the calcaneum. It is said in standard 

 anatomies ot the horse to be a flexor of the knee joint, of the leg on 

 the thigh, and also to bean extensor of the ankle joint. As a flexor 

 of the knee joint the muscle would be antagonistic to the great triceps 



' The anatomist would express these facts as follows : 



The distal end of the scapula and tlio proximal end of the humerus are not 

 all enKasfd in the formation of the shoulder-joint. The joint, indeed, lies well 

 back and constitutes less than one-third of the nlatively enormous area. I wisli 

 particularly to have noted, that the contact between "the surfaces in the joint 

 takes place as shown in figure 3, near the re-enteriufj posteriorly placed angle, 

 wliich is formed between the scapula and the humerus, while, as opposed to this, 

 the contact at the elbow joint between tbe distal end of the humerus and the 

 proximal end of the radius takes place well forward, so as to be near the re-enter- 

 ing anteriorly placed angle between these two bones. H. Allen.

extensor of the thigh. The great extensor cruris, however, pulling 

 on the knee-cap and straightening the knee joint, continually moves 

 forward the oi'igin of the gastrocnemius muscle, and the latter pulling 

 on the calcaneum and contracting itself at the same time, draws for- 

 ward the calcaneum faster than the origin moves forward and acts 

 during the whole step. The muscular fibres of the gastrocnemius 

 are so short in the horse, that if the origin were not moved forward, 

 this muscle would reach its limit Of contraction long before the end 

 of the step. Thus then, the gastrocnemius is auxiliary to the triceps, 

 not antagonistic. 



To prove this completely, let us cut away in the dissected horse 

 the triceps and every other muscle except the gastrocnemius, which 

 we will contract. Its action is precisely as before. It draws forward 

 the calcaneum, but it extends, not Jiexes the knee. 



The paradox disappears when we study a tendon running up the 

 other side of tlie tibia, the tendinous portion of the flexor metatarsi. 

 This tendon takes a greater leverage (fig. 5) 

 on the upper or knee joint that it passes, than 

 on the lower or ankle joint, that it also passes; 

 but the muscle has the reverse leverage. It 

 takes a shorter leverage at the knee than at 

 the ankle. In contracting, therefore, it raises 

 the calcaneum, drawing down the flexor me- 

 tatarsi tendon as shown by the direction of 

 the arrow in the drawing, and the flexor 

 metatarsi extends the knee-joint. Under- 

 standing then the differential action of the 

 giistrocnemius muscle, we might look upon the 

 triceps as the auxiliary of the gastrocnemius 

 in extending the knee-joint. 



The great muscles of the posterior aspect 

 '■ '^' of the thigh, the long vast of the veterinarians 



(part of glut, max.), the biceps, the semi-tendiuosus, the semi-niem- 

 branosus, the gracilis, are inserted not al)ove the knee but below it; 

 not to flex the knee in progression, but to rlraw on an insertion that 

 in a differentia] manner is moving away from the origin of the mus- 

 cles, in order that the wliole of the contractions may be utilized in 

 the whole stride. In progression, then, tlie croup muscles are auxili-

aries to the great triceps on the other side of the femur and to the 

 gastrocnemius. 



The arrangement and action of the thigh muscles are imitated by 

 the rubber bands of the small model (fig. 1). The up and down 

 stick represents the femur, the upper horizontal stick the pelvis, the 

 lower stick the upper end of the tibia. The rubber band from a to 

 c is the rectus femoris muscle, with a short leverage above and a long 

 one below. The rubber band from 6 to d is one of the croup muscles 

 "s\'ith a greater leverage above than below. The simultaneous short- 

 ening of the muscles on ])oth sides of the femur throws, then, the pelvis 

 forward far and fast compared with the actual contraction in the lines 

 of the muscles themselves. 



To show how little this differential co-ordinate action of the muscles 

 and tendons has been understood, I shall quote a passage from 

 Chauveau.* 



Speaking of the tendinous portion of the flexor metatarsi he says: 



" Some have attributed to it still another use, that of passively 

 opposing itself to the flexion of the femur on the leg while standing, 

 and serving thus as an auxiliary to the muscular forces which hold 

 in equilibrium the weight of the body. This is wrong according to 

 us. For it to fulfil this function, the foot would have to be held in 

 a fixed situation by the contraction of its extensor muscles. Now 

 these muscles are indeed the gastrocnemii of the leg, which take 

 their origin behind the femur, and which tend to flex this bone on 

 the tibia, that is to say, to cause the movement which they are sup- 

 posed to be charged to hinder. ' ' 



" Besides, experiment shows pretty well that we are right ; the cut- 

 ting of this tendinous cord, practised on the living animal, does not 

 change its appearance while resting on one or both hind legs." 



^ " Ce tendon jouit de la curieuse propriete de plier le jarret par une action 

 toute mecanique, lors de la flexion des rayons superieurs du meiubre. On lui 

 a encore attribue un autre usage, celui de s' opposcr passivenient a la flexion du 

 lemur sur la jainhe pendant la station et de servir ainsi d' adjuvant aux forces 

 musculaires qui font eciuilibre an poids du corps. C'est a tort, suivant nous. Pour 

 qu' elle (corde conductrice) pat rempUr cc role, il faudrait que le pied fut niain- 

 tenu en situation fixe par la contraction de ses muscles extenseurs. Or, ces 

 muscles sontjustement lesjumeaux de la jarabe, qui prennent leur origine en

Nov>' these people are right in attributing to the flexor metatai-si 

 tendon the function of opposing itself to the flexion of the femur, and 

 wrong only in making this function auxiliary to muscular forces, 

 which are not called upon to sustain weight, and which if called upon 

 in the usual way would start progression. 



"To fulfil the function of sustentation," says Chauveau, "the foot 

 would have to be held by the gastrocnemii muscles which," he says, 

 "tend to flex the femur on the tibia." 



My experiment with the dead horse, the muscular fibres having 

 been cut away, shows that the perforatus and perforans tendons 

 maintain the foot, without the assistance of the gastrocnemius muscle, 

 which does not flex the former upon the tibia, but extends it, as I 

 have shown before. I mistrust entirely the accuracy of Chauveau's 

 observation as to the effect of cutting the tendon in the living hoi-se. 

 The severance of this mighty cord in the dead horse causes instant 

 collapse. I suspeect that in Chauveau's experiment the cord was 

 but imperfectly cut ; or, it may be, that by an 

 extraordinary co-ordination of muscular eflfort 

 the poor beast still stood for a short time previ- 

 ous to its final destruction, but it is inconceiv- 

 able to me that a trained and unprejudiced ob- 

 server should detect no change in the appear- 

 ance of the animal upon the destruction of such 

 a great part of the mechanism. 



I shall close this communication with another 

 beautiful example of muscular differential ac- 

 tion. In the arm of the horse (fig. 6) we have 

 two principal muscles, the biceps in front of the 

 bone and the triceps behind. The biceps flexor 

 radialis surrounds the tendon which I have 

 drawn in heavy black line, and takes a long 

 leverage above, at the shoulder joint, and a 

 vei-y short one below, on the radius. The long 

 head of the triceps arises from the axillary 

 border of the scapula, and is inserted into the 

 The olecranon is set far back and above the elbow joint, 

 to afford to the triceps a greater levei-age below than above, reversing 

 the condition of the biceps. These two muscles, during the act of 

 progression, form a complete circuit of strain. The action of the 



Fig. (j.

180 PKOCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



biceps is to extend the scapula on the humerus. This extension of 

 the scapula pulls through the triceps on the olecranon, and thus gives 

 the biceps a longer leverage on the radius than its own tendon gives it 

 in front of the elbow joint. Consequently the biceps extending the 

 scapula also extends, not flexes, the radius. 



The long head of the triceps, with its long leverage on the olecra- 

 non, extends the forearm, but in so doing it pulls on the tendon of the 

 biceps which, with its short leverage below and long leverage above, 

 extends the shoulder joint, notwithstanding the direct insertion of the 

 triceps into the scapula. The simultaneous contraction of the two 

 muscles will raise the shoulder-blade above the tendinous trajectory, in 

 replacing the tendons and aponeuroses by shorter lines. This causes, 

 especially towards the end of the stride, the great difference between 

 the trajectories of the dead and the living horse. Other circuits of 

 strains connect this part of the limb with the lower part and others 

 with the trunk, so that the least action anywhere is carried through 

 the whole animal. The differential action of the muscles secures to 

 the scapula from which the horse's body hangs, a much longer and 

 swifter throw, a concurrent and auxiliary movement of great mus- 

 cles, generally supposed to be antagonistic, a grace and harmony that 

 any less perfect system of co-ordination would surely miss. This 

 differential scheme is, perhaps, more apparent in the limbs of the 

 horse than anywhere else, but it extends to other parts of its muscular 

 system and to that of other animals including man. 



I think these differential muscles have been a great obstacle to 

 study. One is never sure that he understands the least movement of 

 an animal, unless he can connect it with the whole muscular system, 

 making, in fact, a complete circuit of all the strains. The differential 

 muscles once understood, it is less difficult to connect nearly all the 

 other great muscles with the principal movement of the animal, that 

 of progression in the horse; and to understand, roughly, the com- 

 binations necessary for other movements. 



On the lines of the mighty and simple strains dominating the move- 

 ment, and felt intuitively and studied out by him, the master artist 

 groups, with full intention, his muscular forms. No detail contra- 

 dicts. His men and animals live. Such is the work of three or 

 four modern artists. Such was the work of many an old Greek 

 sculptor.

 of the region of the face. In Chiroptera this is not the case. In 

 comparing the cranium of the long-faced Choeronycteris and the 

 short-faced Ametrida, it is remarked that not only are the face- 

 proportions contrasted, but those of the zygomatic arches arc changed 

 (namely, in being slender or al).sent in the one and high in the 

 other), wliile the face is broad at its base and the me3()j)terygoid 

 fossa widened. The greyhound and the English pug-dog exliil)it 

 similar contrasts. In these varieties, in addition, the tympanic bulla 

 is relatively larger in the pug-dog than in tlie greyhound. In Pro- 

 boscidea the contrast between the length of the face-axis in Mndodon 

 and Elephas can be expressed in the development of the pneumatic 

 spaces in the skull ; not, indeed, by the inflation of the tympanic 




182 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



bullie, or other parts of the base of the skull, but by the inflation of 

 the diploic structure of the frontal and parietal bones. 



In Edentata the difference between the long-faced Tatusia, Myr- 

 mecophaga and the short-faced Megatherium, Brachjpu^ and Cholopus, 

 is about what has been already noted in the foregoing examples. 

 The zygomatic arch in the group last named, although incomplete, 

 is high. The tymj^anic bulla, it is true, is inconstantly inflated, but 

 that of the sinus in the frontal bone, compared with what is noted 

 in the long- faced types, is like that which is seen in Elephas as com- 

 pared with Madodon. 



Similar points can be established in the Quadrumana. Macacxis 

 can be separated from Cynopithecus, not only by the length of the 

 face, but by Maeacus having a more inflated tympanic bone. The 

 same remark is true of Propithecus and Nycticebus as compared with 

 Lemur. 



The genera of Carnivora, as illustrated in Melursiis and Helarc- 

 tos, are in evidence of the same. 



Even in birds, as was suggested by Mr. Fred. Lucas to Dr. Allen, 

 the difference between the owl and the pelican and stork can be de- 

 noted by the amount of diploic structure in the head, as well as by 

 the length of the face. 



In Artiodactyla the evidence is obscure. In the remarkable fossil 

 genus Cydopidius, described by Prof. Cope, all the co-ordinates ap- 

 pear to be well established, namely, an extreme short face-axis is 

 accompanied with great increase of width of the zygomatic arches 

 and large tympanic bones. But these bones are generally large in 

 the long-faced artiodactyles. The influence of many factors of neces- 

 sity must be borne in mind before all the terms of the equation can be 

 determined. 



Care must be taken not to confound an isolated inflation of the 

 tympanic bulla with the probable co-ordination above named. In 

 Corynorhinus, Euderma and Dipus, as in some species of Vulpes, 

 the inflation is correlative with the size of the auricle, at least is 

 independent of the problem of face-shortening. 



Many suggestive features present themselves in the skull of man. 

 The inflations here, while basic, are not seen in the tympanic bones, 

 but in the tissue at the median aspect of the petrosal bones, and at 

 the sides of the exoccipitals. Prognathic and orthognatic forms can 

 be distinguished, as a rule, readily by these parts of the base of the 

 skull ; but, as in all things pertaining to the study of the human skull 

 co-ordinations are exceptionally difficult to establish. We are here 

 dealing not with characterizations of a generic kind, but with those 

 which are mutatory in trilial or racial groups of sub-species, and it is 

 not reasonable to look for features so sharply defined as are those of 

 genera of quadrupeds. 



Hyperostosis on the Inner Side of the Human Lower Jaw. Dr. 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 183 



Harrison Allen also stated that in 1889 (Toner Lecture, Smithsonian 

 Institution) he announced the presence of a nodular hyperostosis on 

 the inner side of the horizontal ramus of the lower jaw of the Esqui- 

 maux. Virchow, 1890 (Zeitsch. fiir Authropologie), brietly refers 

 to a sclerosed alveolar nodule in both the upper and lower jaw of a 

 Santa Barbara Indian. Dr. Allen thought it probable that Vir- 

 chow's claim (Crania Ethnica Americana, 1893) that his mass and 

 the one in the Esquimaux lower jaw were the same would not be sus- 

 tained. Virchow states that the Santa Barbara Indian exhibited the 

 nodules best developed in the upper jaw, which gave his observation 

 a distinct significance. Dr. Allen had lately noted the peculiarity, 

 previously observed by him in the Esquimaux, well-developed in the 

 lower jaw of the so-called Mound Builders. No claim is made that 

 the hyperostosis is of ethnic significance, though the presence of a 

 sclerosed hyperostosed surtace constantly present in the Esquimaux 

 and occasionally present in the people of the Mounds, while it has 

 never been noted in the lower jaw^ of any other tribes, is an interest- 

 ing fact.

SOME NOTES FROM A STUDY OF THE PROVANCHER COLLECTION OF 

 ICHNEUMONID^. 



BY G. C. DAVIS. 



It was with much satisfaction and liigh anticipations that I at 

 last found myself ou the train, en route to Quebec, Canada, for the 

 purpose of studying the types of Ichneumonidiie in the Provancher 

 collection. Ever since a short while after the death of the Abbe, 

 I had been trying to ascertain what had become of the collection 

 and its condition, but my efforts proved futile until recently, through 

 the kindness of the Rev. Thos. W. Fyles, I learned of its location 

 and the means of access to it. 



I found the collection, as a whole, in three rooms of the Parliament 

 Building at Quebec. It was recently purchased by the province and 

 is a nucleus for a museum. The Abbe's collection consisted largely 

 of insects and shells, and the whole is now under the charge of 

 Mr. Saint Cyr, to whom great credit is due for the present good 

 condition of the collection. As curator he devotes his whole time 

 to the museum work, and throughout my stay very kindly assisted 

 me in every way possible. The relatives of the Abbe did not realize 

 the value of the collection of insects accumulated by him, and it 

 was only by the earnest effort of Mr. Saint Cyr, who was a co-worker 

 with the Abbe, that the collection was saved from entire destruction. 



Although the collection had been in their charge but a short time 

 the Lepidoptera were largely spoiled and many injured, and the other 

 orders suffered considerably. As the collection now stands, it is 

 neatly labeled and in fairly good cabinets. My time with the collec- 

 tion was quite limited, and farther than this I can only speak for the 

 IchneumonidK. In that family I found quite a number of types 

 missing and some broken with only a part remaining. Another 

 feature, somewhat unsatisfactory, is, that, the collection is composed 

 primarily of two individual collections, which still remain separate, 

 and frequently specimens, labelled the same, were found to belong 

 to different genera and often to different subfamilies. This at once 

 showed a very superficial knowledge of the classification, and had 

 I not soon obtained the cue to it and had access to the Abbe's 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA . 185 



descriptions, which are fairly accurate as far as they go, the arrange- 

 ment would have been still more annoying. 



It had been my fear for some time that probably there were 

 a number of eri'ors in the Abbe's classification of species which 

 he described as new. The synonyms v\hich Mr. Cresson found in 

 making his check list, the reports of other careful workers who had 

 seen some of the Abbe's work, and some examples of his determina- 

 tions sent me for veriiication, all went to prove this suspicion was 

 not without foundation. Feeling that good scientific work could not 

 be continued on the Ichneumonida? as long as many uncertain species 

 were of doubtful classification, it seemed A^^sest to rectify these errors 

 before any further descriptive work was done in the family. This 

 and a chance to study the types was the object of my visit. To say 

 that I found errors is needless, as the list following this introduction 

 will speak for itself. This list of corrections which I shall give is 

 complete only in one respect, viz. : classification of species in the 

 right genus. There are certainly many synonyms yet. to be worked 

 out, but it will take more time to determine these, and the few given 

 herein are what I incidentally happened to recognize at a glance. 

 Quite a number of corrections and additions to the descriptions will 

 also be needed to make them clear and replete, but I shall not at 

 this time even touch upon this matter. The list is from notes taken 

 at the time the specimens were examined. The species not mentioned 

 are correct as to classification.

A NEW SPECIES OF THE ISOPOD-GENUS BATHYNOMUS. 

 BY DR. A. ORTMANN. 



In the year 1877, A. Agassiz dredged at 955 fathoms, in the Gulf 

 of Mexico, a gigantic Isopod, described by A. Milne-Edwards 

 (Compt. Rend. Acad. Sc, t. 88, 1879, p. 21, and Annal. Magaz. 

 Nat. Hist. (5) III., 1879, p. 241) as BatJujnomus glgautew-i. De- 

 lineations of this form were subsequently published by Filhol (La- 

 vie au fond desMers, Paris, 1885, p. 147),^ and by A. Agassiz (Three 

 Cruisesof the "Blake." Bull. :\rus. Compar. Zool., Vol. XV., 1888, 

 fig. 252. ) Wood-]Mason and Alcock made mention of the same species 

 (Annal. Magaz. Nat. Hist. (6) VII., 1891, p. 270) taken by the 

 "Investigator" in the Bay of Bengal at 740 fathoms. Lastly, 

 Hansen (Det K. Dansk. Vidensk. Selsk. Skr. Nat. Math. Afd. (6), 

 V. 3, 1890, pp. 252, 318, 378) pointed out the close resemblance to 

 the family Cirolanidte, while Milne- Edwards proposed to place this 

 genus in a new group or family, "Ci/mothoadlois branchifh'es." This 

 latter opinion was adopted by Wood- Mason and Alcock in creating 

 the family Bathynomidio. 



After a careful examination of both opinions I believe Hansen's 

 classification to be correct. 



Bathynomm (jlrjanteus, which is remarkable, not only for its enor- 

 mous size, but also for other morphological characters, was hitherto 

 the only species of the genus. I describe herein a second species 

 collected by L. D(iderlein, during his sojourn in Tokio, Japan (1880- 

 81), which, although smaller than the other, always attains dimen- 

 sions unusual among the Isopoda. I propose to name the new species 

 in honor of the discoverer, Bathijnomm dijderleinl. 



Diagnosis. — Body more slender than in B. gigunteus, three times 

 as long as Ijroad (B. giganteus is not two-and-a-half times as long 

 as broad). The last segment of the body (telson) is but little 

 broader than long, its posterior margin is provided with seven spines, 

 the middle one of which is the greatest. In the median line of the 

 upper surface is a distinct longitudinal ridge. Both branches of the 

 uropoda are pointed at the ends. 



' I have only seen the copy in Marshall, Die Tiefscc nml ihr Lcben, 1888, p. 861, 

 fig. 86. 




192 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



Description. — Total length of the greater specimen 128 mm., 

 breadth 42 mm., of the smaller 103 mm. and 36 mm. The whole 

 upper surface finely granulated and punctured. 



Frontal margin, in the middle, feebly sinuated, with a short pro- 

 cess bent downwards. Eyes placed in the lower surface of the head, 

 beneath the frontal margin, which is distinctly raised. Lamina 

 frontalis equilaterally triangular, the angles rounded, the anterior 

 meeting with the frontal process. Clypeus produced forward as a 

 blunt, triangular projection, extending over the frontal margin so as 

 to be visible from above, its longitudinal diameter greater than that 

 of the labrum. The stalk of the antennuhe has three joints, the 

 flagellum is about as long as the stalk, with nearly thirty joints. 

 Stalk of the antenna? five-jointed, the first joint short and concealed, 

 Flagellum in both specimens mutilated, the longest fragment has 

 twenty-five joints, and reaches to the posterior margin of the first 

 segment of the trunk. 



Segments of the body finely punctured, the first as long as the 

 head, the others considerably shorter, decreasing a little from before 

 to behind. The first and second epimera nearly alike, not produced 

 posteriorly, the four following posteriorly acutely produced, especi- 

 ally those of the fifth, sixth and seventh segments. The three an- 

 terior pairs of feet stout, second joint (see Hansen) not thickened, 

 third longer than broad, fourth with the inner margin thorny, the 

 process of its outer margin reaching to the middle of the sixth joint 

 (but in the first pair of feet very short), sixth joint elongated and 

 curved. The four following pairs of legs similar to each other, in- 

 creasing in length. Second joint not remarkably thickened or en- 

 larged. Third joint distally enlarged, the anterior margin with 

 prickles, similar prickles at the anterior margin of the fourth and 

 fifth joints. Sixth joint but little longer than the fifth, narrow. 



Segments of the pleon evenly arched, the lateral angles of the 

 second to fifth produced posteriorly and provided with a longitudinal 

 ridge, those of the third segment longest. Pleopoda with roundish, 

 almost equal branches, carrying at the hinder part of their bases the 

 tufts of branchiae characteristic of the genus, but since both are dried 

 specimens the pleopoda and the branchiae have become crumpli'd, 

 and therefore it is impossible to give the details. 



Last segment (telson) punctured and finely granulated, at tlu' 

 base but little larger than long, the lateral margins somewhat con- 




1894.] NATFKAI. SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 198 



verging posteriorly. Posterior margin truncated and provided with 

 seven spines. The median line of this segment is occupied by a 

 longitudinal keel, produced to the end of the middle spine of the 

 posterior margin. This spine is somewhat longer than the others 

 which are likewise somewhat unequal, on either side the second (from 

 the middle outwards) being a little longer than the other laterals. 

 Stem of the uropoda produced at the inner posterior angle, outer 

 branch elongated, the margins nearly parallel, acuminated at the 

 end. The inner branch almost triangular, acuminated posteriorly, 

 longer than the outer, not looking over the telson. Both branches 

 with several prickles at the margins. 



The legs were originally covered with hair, but now are nearly 

 worn bare because of the dry conservation. The hairs on the mar- 

 gins of the uropods and the telson are also preserved only here and 

 there. 



This species occurs on the Ja])anese coast, near Enoshima, Sagami 

 Bay. The depth is not recorded; probably it lives associated with 

 the famous Japanese Hexactinellida} and Lithistidic. The types be- 

 long to the Doderlein collections and are deposited in the museum 

 of Strassburg, Germany.

THIRD ADDITION TO A KNOWLEDGE OF THE BATRACHIA AND 

 REPTILIA OF COSTA RICA. 



BY E. D. COPE. 



The present paper is a coutinuation of the subject which has been 

 treated in several contributions, and is preliminary to a second illus- 

 trated memoir, which, it is hoped, will present the subject in some 

 completeness. The last "Addition" appeared in the Proceedings of 

 the American Philosophical Society for 1893, p. 333; and the illus- 

 trated memoir was published in the Journal of this Academy for 

 1875. 



I am indebted to the Museo Nacional of San Jose for the oppor- 

 tunity of examining the material here described. 



BATRACHIA. 



URODELA. 

 (Edipus robustus sj). nov. 



Size large ; proportions robust. Twelve costal folds. One pha- 

 lange of digits free, as in ffi. jiiorio, except in the inner (first) digits, 

 which are entirely enclosed. Extended limbs separated by two 

 intercostal spaces. Head flat, wide ; muzzle short, its truncation 

 little conspicuous; no canthus rostralis. Width of head entering 

 length to groin five times. Eye small, its fissure equaling one- 

 fourth the width of the head, and less than the interorbital space. 

 Vomerine series straight in the transverse direction ; extending 

 beyond the nares externally, and abruptly recurved at the internal 

 extremity toward the parasphenoid patch, which they do not reach. 

 Parasphenoid patch not divided anteriorly. Tail rounded, the ex- 

 tremity moderately compressed. A gular fold. 



Color, uniform plumbeous ; soles paler. 



Dimensions 206 mm. ; length of head and body, 98 mm. ; to gular 

 fold, 22 ram. ; width of head at rictus oris, 16.5 mm. ; length of an- 

 terior limb, 20 mm. ; do. of fore foot, 6.5 mm. ; length of posterior 

 limb, 21.5 ram. ; do. of hind foot, 6 mm. ; width of do. at base of 

 fifth digit, 7 mm. 



This is the largest salamander of tropical America, equaling in 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 195 



length tlie Spekrpe^ hellii Gray. It reseml^les in ajipearance the 

 unicolor form of that species, but differs in its proportions, as Avell 

 as in the generic character displayed by the feet. The muzzle is 

 longer, and more broadly truncate, and the head is narrower, tlian in 

 the S. bellii. In the latter the eye is larger, equaling the width of the 

 interorbital space plus that of an eyelid, and is little less than half 

 the width of the head posteriorly.

 in vertical diameter. Iris dark. Planus almost without web ; pes 

 fully palmate. Thumb not opposed. Heel of extended hind limb 

 reaching end of muzzle. Canthus rostralis straight angular, lores 

 vertical. AVidth of interorbital space 1.5 times the width of an 

 eyelid. External nostrils terminal, a little nearer the eye than the 

 diameter of the latter. Muzzle not prominent, vertical in profile. 

 Skin smooth above. 



Head and body above pigmented probably with yellow, in abrupt 

 contrast to the color of the rest of the integument, from which it is 

 separated from the orbit to the sacrum by a narrow white stripe. 

 Colors otherwise uniform straw-color, the limbs pigmented on the 

 exposed surfaces; the humerus and femur not jngmented.

No. 253, Alajuela, R. Alfaro. 



This sipall and brightly colored s|iecies differs rniui all oihors 

 known to me in the combination of characters it presents. The 

 sharp canthus rostralis, anterior vomerine teeth, elongate tongue, 

 large choansc, and webless fingers, are not found together in any 

 Other sjiecies. It is dedicated to Mr. (.4eo. K. Cherrie, of San Jose,

collection. 



Hylella chrysops sp. nov. 



Head short, wide, canthus rostralis wanting. Tongue a little 

 longer than wide, faintly emarginate ; ostea pharyngea each a trans- 

 verse slit. Tympanum not visible. Pupil a dumb-bell shaped 

 horizontal slit in the golden iris. Heel of extended hind limb 

 reaching to end of muzzle. The muzzle is as long as the diameter 

 of the eye, and does not project beyond the lips ; nostrils terminal. 

 The fingers are one-third webbed, the thumb free, and at least as 

 long as the short third (second) digit. Hallucal tubercle minute ; 

 pallets well developed. 



Color above and below yellow ; pigment more conspicuous on 

 edges of eyelids. No markings of any kind, except that one speci- 

 men is covered above with rather distinct, minute, black specks. 



Total length, 22 mm. ; length of head to canthus oris, 6 mm. ;

No. 252, Alajuela, R. Alfaro ; 492, 8an Jose, P. Biolley. 



This small and brilliant species is related distantly to the H. platy- 

 cephala Cope, from the West Coast of Mexico. In that species the 

 canthus rostralis and the tympanum are well marked, and the size 

 is larger. 



Lithodytes euryglossus sp. uov. 



A large species with small pallets, in which the heel does not 

 reach the end of the muzzle, although it extends to a point anterior 

 to the eye. General appearance that of a Leptodacti/las. No dis- 

 tinct canthus rostralis ; end of muzzle sloping backwards from lip- 

 border. Tympanic disc a vertical oval, of which the long diameter 

 is two-thirds that of the eye. Nostril nearer the end of the muzzle 

 than its distance from the orbit. Tongue wider than long, openly 

 notched posteriorly. Choante moderate. Vomerine teeth in two trans- 

 verse series, on transverse ridges whose anterior borders are in line 

 with the posterior borders of the choanse, and whose external borders 

 are a little within the internal borders of the choanic. Ostia pharyn- 

 gea larger than choanic. Pallets distinct but small, smallest on the 

 manus. Digits without dermal margins. First and second fingers

equal. Integument everywhere smootli. A discoidal abdominal 

 fold. A fold on the distal half of the external border of the tarsus, 

 extending to a rather prominent prrehallucal tubercle. 



Color above, brownish lead- color ; below whitish. Groin reticu- 

 late, and sides punctate with the dorsal on the ventral color. Four 

 brown spots on the upper lip anterior to the line of the tympanum, 

 and a black streak above and behind the tympanum. A blackish 

 cross- band between the posterior parts of the orbite, and some black 

 longitudinal spots on the dorso-lateral region, bounding upwards the 

 paler color of the sides. Limbs with obscure blackish cross-bands. 

 Thighs behind, whitish at base, and obscurely reticulate on the supe- 

 rior and distal portions. Limbs below, and gular region, clouded. 



Total length of head and body, 75 mm. ; do. of head to line of 

 canthus oris, 19 mm; width of head at do., 28 mm. Length of 

 anterior limb, 40 mm. ; do. of head, 18 mm. ; do. of posterior limb, 

 115 mm. ; do. of liind foot, 50 mm. ; do. of astragalo-calcaneum, 

 20 mm. 



This is the largest species of Lithodytes, but it is less robust than 

 the L. (julo8}is Co])e. In general appearance it resembles one of 

 the large species of Leptochiciijlu.i, but it is a true Hylodine, with 

 T-shaped terminal phalanges. It has some resemblance to L. mela- 

 no4ictii>i, but that species has much longer hind limbs, larger pallets, 

 an oval tongue, etc. A single specimen of the L. eiin/(/los.'<iis is in 

 the collection, whicli was taken at San Jose, by Sen. P. liiolley (No. 

 448). 



Levirana vibicaria ften. et sp. nov. 



Char. (jen. — Identical with Rionihi, but without vomerine teeth. 



Char. .•<pecif. — Form robust, muzzle short, wide; hind limbs rather 

 short, the heel reaching to the front of the eye. Canthus rostralis 

 strongly marked, angulated at the nostril, anterior to which it is de- 

 flected to the apex, which does not project beyond the lip- border. 

 Jjoral region slightly concave; nostril nearly on canthus, -0 the 

 length of the muzzle anterior to the orbit. Tyujpanic drum sub- 

 round, about -7 the diameter of the eye-slit. Choami- rather small, 

 about equal to ostia pharyngea. Tongue large obovate, dee{)ly 

 emarginate posteriorly. Digits with slight terminal eidargements; 

 those of the fingers scarcely distinct, those of the toes supported by 

 elongate T-shaped phalanges. Second (first ) finger a little shorter 




198 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



than third ^second): inferior tubercles inconspicuous. Toes half- 

 webbed, fourth digit with three, the others with two free phalanges. 

 Sole with one tubercle, the flat oval prtehallux. Integument smooth 

 everywhere. A wide glandular body connecting rictus oris and 

 humerus ; a glandular thickening extending from orbit to end of 

 urostyle, which is unusually wide between the orbit and the sacrum. 

 No dermal folds. 



Color above a dark olivaceous gray; side of head and a stripe 

 from orbit to urostyle, black. Two rows of small black spots on 

 each side of the vertebral column. Superior side of limbs colored 

 like the back. Inferior sui'faces of the body yellowish, more dis- 

 tinctly yellow on inferior surfaces of hind limbs. Concealed surface 

 of femur with a reddish tinge, unspotted. Superior face of femur 

 with a black stripe on the distal half. Lips unspotted, with a dark 

 shaded border. 



Length of head and body 65 mm. ; do. of head to rictus oris 

 21 mm. ; width of head at rictus oris, 25 mm.; length of fore limb, 

 40 mm.; of hand, 15 mm.; length of hind limb, 101 mm.; of hind 

 foot, 49 mm.; of astragalo-calcaneum, IG mm. 



No. 3912, Rancho Kedondo on the divide of the Irazu Range; 

 3915-6, Isla Nueva near the head of the Rio Sucio, on the Atlantic 

 side ; all taken by G. K. (^herrie. 



This distinct species is probal^ly an inhabitant of the elevated 

 mountain region, and it has so far escaped the observation of collec- 

 tors, Avho have mostly explored lower elevations. It is not nearly 

 related to any species hitherto known. 



REPTILIA. 



LACERTILIA. 

 Cnemidophorus amivoides sp. nov. 



Eight abdominal rows of subequal plates; a row of plates at the 

 gular fold, which, with a few granules form its border. A group of 

 about 18 enlarged posterior gular scales, which does not have a 

 transverse posterior border separating it from smaller scales. Nos- 

 trils in nasal suture. Three supraorbitals, a small plate occupying an 

 angular space between the second and third, at the external edge on 

 both sides. Two interparietals and one parietal, followed by three 

 rows of smaller plates. Five infralabials in the second (large) row. 

 Sixteen femoral pores. Four preanal plates larger than those sur- 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 199 



roundinu them, two of them transverse and posterior, and two longi- 

 tudinal and anterior. Three rows of brachial plates, the anterior 

 continuous with the posterior of two rows of antebrachials. No 

 postantebrachials. Four rows of plates on inferior side of femur at 

 middle, and two rows on inferior side of tibia. 



Color above dark brown, with three narrow yellowish stripes on 

 each side, which proceed respectively from the temple, and from the 

 superior and inferior liorders of the tympanum. The inferior stripe 

 is more or less broken into elongate spots. The space between the 

 superior and median stripes is marked by black cross-bars, and a 

 row of black spots extends along the inner side of each of the supe- 

 rior stripes. A light stripe on the posterior face of the femur, which 

 is continued on the tail. Below this stripe on the femur, another 

 less perfect stripe, and above it a longitudinal row of spots. Tibia 

 with small light spots. Upper surface of femur and tibia brown, 

 blackish varied. Inferior surfaces pale greenish- blue ; top of head 

 light brown. 



Length of head and body, 64 nun. ; length to edge of gular fold, 

 21 mm.; do. to auricular meatus, 15 mm.; width of head at rictus 

 oris, 11 mm. Length of fore limb from axilla, 21 mm.; length of 

 fore foot, 10 mm. ; length of hind leg from cantlius ani, 45 mm.; do. 

 of hind foot, 24 mm. 



This species resembles very much the younger specimens of the 

 Amiva uvdulata, but is a true Cnemidophorus with sagittiform 

 tongue. It difters in specific characters from both that species and 

 the A. quadrtliiieata, in the possession of three rows of brachial scuta, 

 instead of one. In coloration it differs from the young striped stages 

 of those species in having three light stripes on each side instead of 

 two. The longitudinal division of the interparietal plate is a marked 

 peculiarity, but may be abnormal. The two plates together, how- 

 ever, are larger in dimensions than a single interparietal. Among 

 CUiemidophori it is nearest to the C lemnisnitiis in appearance, but 

 it difters in almost all points of squamation of the head and throat. 



No. 2.36, La (arjiintera ; A. Alfaro. 



Cnemidophorus alfaronis >i'. ii"v. 



Allied to C. deppei. Nostril entirely in nasal plate ; first loreal 

 bordering first three labials; second loreal higher than long. Supra- 

 orl)ital plates four on (jne side, and five on the other, the lirst (juitf

small, the third and fourth broader than long. Interparietals and 

 the single parietals, longer than the frontoparietals. Infralabials 

 eight; median gulars enlarged all the way across, graded; scales of 

 mesoptychium large, in two or three rows, no granules on the border. 

 Abdominal plates in eight rows; large brachials in six rows, continu- 

 ous with brachials ; no postantebrachials. Six rows of femorals at 

 middle. Femoral jiores nineteen. Pi'eanal plates about a dozen in 

 a triangular patch continuous with the ventruls. Extended hind foot 

 reaches to orbit. 



Four white lines on each side, and a vertebral line. Spaces be- 

 tween first and second, and dorsally between fourths of opposite side, 

 greenish-gray; space between second and fourth, black. Head 

 paler; below greenish-white. Posterior limbs with four irregular 

 longitudinal lines; one anterior, two superior, and one posterior. 



Total length, 170 mm.; length to vent, 55 mm.; do. to collar, 

 19 mm.; length of fore limb, 20 mm.; do. of hind limb, 41 mm.; 

 do. of hind foot, 23 mm. 



This species resembles in general appearance the C. deppei deppei,^ 

 but the scutellation is materially diflferent. An important character 

 is the presence of four supraorbital plates, from the last of which a 

 fifth may be cut off". The parietals and interparietals are also rela- 

 tively longer than in that species. 



No. 216, San Mateo; found by Sen. Anastasio Alfaro, Director of 

 the Museo Nacional, to whom the species is dedicated. 



Celestus cyanochloris sp. uov. 



Scales in thirty-three longitudinal series all with about a dozen 

 longitudinal keels, and no prominent median keel, except on the tail, 

 beyond the base. The scales of the tail are roof-shaped, so that 

 the lateral edges run in open furrows, while the middle line is promi- 

 nent. The striations extend not only to the head, but the parietal 

 and interparietal plates are grooved and ridged. The rostral and 

 syraphyseal plates are of equal width. Two postnasals, two pre- 

 loreals and two postloreals, one above the other in each pair. A 

 large preocular; two suboculars, the posterior elongate, and four 

 postoculars. Four external, and four internal supraorbitals. Parie- 

 tals wider than the triangular interparietal, each three times as large

as the well-separated frontoparietals, and bounded by five scales 

 between the frontoparietal and the single transverse postparietal. 

 Frontal twice as wide as long. Eight superior labials to end of long 

 subocular, the second reaching to the middle of the postnasal only. 

 Auricular meatus horizontal, shorter than eye fissure. Extended 

 limbs separated by the length of the anterior foot only. 



Color above light golden-green, with several indistinct longitudinal 

 rows of paler spots as large as a scale, mingled with as many brown 

 spots as large as a scale. Sides paler than back. Lower surfaces 

 blue, paler on chin and tail. 



Total length (end of tail lost), 151mm.; do. to vent, 70 mm.; 

 do. to line of axilla, 16 mm. ; do. of fore limb, 16.5 mm.; do. of hind 

 limb, 22 mm.; of hind foot, 11 mm. 



This species is allied to the C. stei)idachne)'ii Cojie. The latter has 

 seven superior labials instead of eight, of which the second reaches 

 the loreal, as it does not in C. cyanochlorix; the postnasals are much 

 shorter. The scales of the anterior regions and parietal plates, are 

 smooth, and the color is totally different. The limbs are shorter. 



This handsome species, whose coloration is unique in the genus, 

 was found by Sen. Juan Cooper, on the volcano of Irazu, No. 217. 



OPHIDIA. 



ASINEA. 

 Trimetopon pliolepis sp. nov. 



In the genus Trimetopon Cope, I find that the hemipenis has a 

 simple sulcus sperraaticus, and that the apex for a space on each side 

 of the sulcus is feebly calyculate. The rest of the surface is occupied 

 by spines which are in longitudinal scries, and are largest opposite 

 the sulcus at the lower part of the hemipenis. The genus is then to 

 be regarded as one of the Colubrintc allied to Coutin. A single 

 species, the T. gracilr Gthr., has been described hitherto, which is 

 also from Costa Kica. I only know it from the description and 

 figures of Giinthcr in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History 

 for 1872, p. 16. 



Char. Kper-if. — Scales in seventeen rows, like the plates of the head 

 with iridescent refulgence and without fossa-. Rostral j>lat(' not 

 visible from above; interna.sals much wider than long; anterior bor- 

 der of frontal slightly convex forwards. Latrral IxmliT of frontal 




202 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



shorter than the parietal border, which forms less than a ritrht an^le 

 with that of the opposite side. Loreal longer than high; oculars 

 1-1, the anterior well separated from frontal by superciliary. Tem- 

 porals 1-1; superior labials eight, fourth and fifth entering orbit, all 

 longer than high except the eighth. Inferior labials eight, fifth 

 largest, and in contact with postgenial. Postgenials half as long as 

 pregenials. Total length, 287 mm.; of tail, 76 mm. Gastrosteges, 

 154; anal 1-1; urosteges 69. 



Dark brown above, the scales with a paler, minutely speckled 

 center, except those of the third row. This, together with the more 

 restricted pale centers of the scales of the first and second rows, gives 

 the appearance of a dark lateral band, which tips the gastrosteges. 

 Below uniform yellow. A narrow yellow collar borders, and does 

 not cross the extremities of the parietal plates. Each upper labial 

 with a large yellow spot next the border; that at the top of the sixth 

 and front of the seventh has the effect of a postocular band. 



Tliis species differs from the type in the scale formula. In the 

 T. (jracile, the scales are in fifteen rows; the oculars are 1-2, and 

 there are but seven superior labials. The coloration is more ob- 

 scure. 



No. 451, San Jose, P. Biolley. 



Drymobius paucicarinatus sp. uov. 



Scales in seventeen rows, the five median only keeled, and that 

 faintly. Oculars 1-2 ; preocular not reaching frontal ; loreal sub- 

 quadrate, longer than high. Temjx)rals 1-2; four and a half 

 scales bordering each parietal. Superior labials nine, fourth, fifth, 

 and sixth in orbit ; eighth and ninth longer than high. Eye large, 

 its diameter equaling length of muzzle from its border to the nostril, 

 and equaling a little over half of the interocular width ; equal also 

 length from rostral to frontal plate: equal length of frontal plate, 

 and exceeding a little the length of the common parietal suture. 

 Frontal plate wide in front, contracting rapidly posteriorly, lateral 

 borders very little concave. Ten inferior labials. Postgenials longer 

 than pregenials. The scales are not much narrowed, and those of 

 the sides are rather wide. Total length, 1,230 mm.; tail, 415 mm.; 

 length to canthus oris (axial) 26*5 mm. Gastrosteges 183; anal 

 1-1; urosteges, 127. 



Color above brown, without markings; below yellow; ends and a

narrow transverse line near base of o.astroste<res, lead colored. Upper 

 lip, except upper iiarts of Nos. 2-3-4, 8 and 9, yellow. 



No. 116; La Candelaria, Bruno Carranza. 



This species is allied to the D. percarinatus Cope (Proceeds. 

 Amer. Philos. Soc, 1894, p. 344), but differs in the much smaller 

 number of more feebh' keeled scales; in the shorter and wider head, 

 and in the coloration. 



Dr. Giinther has united under the head of the Dendrophidium 

 dexdrophls (Dryniobiiis dendropltis Schl., Fauna Centrali- Ameri- 

 cana, 1894), the species DriimoblKs cldi>rofict(.< and Cro!<santhera 

 melanotropis Cope. Bocourt has pointed out that the genus Dendro- 

 phidium differs from Drymobius in the entire anal plate and I have 

 not found any variability in this respect in the specimens at my dis- 

 posal. In the D. dendrophis the eye is larger, its long diameter 

 exceeding the width of the superciliary and frontal plates together; 

 while in the species mentioned ;d)ove, and the D. perrartnafus and 

 D. rhombifer Pet., the diameter of the eye either equals the width of 

 those plates, or, more frequently is considerably less. The Crossan- 

 thera mehniofropis further differs in the short occipital plates, whose 

 middle suture is considerably less than the diameter of the orbit, 

 while it is the same in the D. dendrophis. 



Leptophis ultramarinus sp. nov. 



The relation of this species to those already known may be shown 

 in the following table. I mention here that a study of the species 

 shows that it is impossible to keep apart as a separate genus {PliUo- 

 thavmus) the species with smooth scales. 



I. Scales all smooth. 



Nine superior lal)ials. Scales above l)lue tipped with golden ; 

 scuta and two inferior rows of scales golden with green bases; no 

 stripes, L. ortonii Cope. 



II. Three median rows smooth, two or three on each side keeled. 

 Eight supralabials; green, with black median lines on two or 



three dorsal rows of scales ; pale oblifjue cross- lines on the anterior 

 half of the body, />• oayl! Fisch. 



III. Five median dorsal rows keeled.

Supralabials nine; uniform green, the keels of the scales, except 



those of the median row, black ; size large, L. jynestans C!ope. 



The L. ult)'amarinns is further characterized by the large size of 

 its eye, whose diameter equals the length of the muzzle to the rostral 

 plate, exclusive. The preocular reaches the frontal. Temporals 

 1-2, the anterior in contact with the inferior postocular only. Each 

 parietal is bounded by only three plates, with half of a median plate. 

 Seventh and eighth superior labials longer than deep. Nine infe- 

 rior labials, in contact with the genials up to the seventh. Post- 

 genials a little longer than pregenials. General form slender, tail 

 long, about one- third the total length, gastrosteges feebly angulated, 

 168; anal, 1-1; urosteges, 176. Total length, 1050 mm.; tail, 

 425 mm. 



Besides the colors above described there may be added, that the 

 preorbital labials are bordered with blue above, and the last two 

 labials are entirely blue. There are no stripes or lines of any kind.

Fogonaspis ruficeps gen. et sp. nov. 



Char. yen. — Posterior maxillary tooth elongate, grooved; other 

 teeth numerous, small, present on the usual bones of the mouth. 

 Pupil round. Cephalic plates normal; two nasals, no loreal. One 

 pair of genials; anal plate and urosteges double. Scales smooth, 

 without apical fossa, extensively imliricate. In the hemipenis the 

 sulcus spermaticus is single, and the apex is calyculate. On the side 

 opposite the sulcus is a wide welt which is bordered by spines, whose 

 bases are connected by transverse flounces. Surface on each side of 

 welt coarsely spinous. 



This genus is probably more nearly allied to TantiUa than to any 

 other. The head of the only known species is rather more distinct 

 than is usual in that genus. The tail is probably elongate. It 

 differs from TantiUa in the large single genial plate.

 between prefrontal and second labial. Oculars 1-2, preocular well 

 removed from frontal ; temporals 1-1, superior labials seven ; the 

 first bounds the })ostnasal lielow; the second the prefrontal and the

Color in alcohol, above light brown, below yellow. Median dor- 

 sal row of scales deep brown; a narrow yellow line on the adjacent 

 borders of the third and fourth rows of scales which is bounded 

 above by a single dark brown row, and below by several rows with 

 dark brown centers, growing paler towards the gastrosteges. All 

 the colors are less conspicuous })osteriorly. Upper surface of head 

 light reddish- brown, with a pale spot at the extremity of each

This specimen gives me the opportunity of examining the hemi- 

 penis of this genus. I find that it is undivided, but that the sulcus 

 is bifurcate near the e-\trcniity. The surface of the organ is marked 

 with longitudinal lamin:e only, and these are set with numerous small 

 spines to the a|>ex. The lamime are separated by deep grooves. 



As already described by me, there are very few teeth in the mouth. 

 These consist of a few small ones at the p<Jsterior part of the maxil- 

 lary bone, with one or two near the junction of the palatine and 

 pterygoid, and a few on the anterior half of the dentary. The large 

 posterior tooth is incurved and flattened, and has a thin blade with a 

 cutting erlge |K)steriorly. The groove is fine if present. This arrange- 

 ment reminds of the characters of the genus ElurhlKlodoii^ Keinhdt., of

which the sole species is found in the Paleotropical Kealm. The few 

 teeth of Ennluis are, however, better developed than in Elachido- 

 don, whose real affinities are as yet uncertain. EnuUus is probably 

 allied to Scytale, since it not only enters the Scytalinjc, as defined in 

 my paper on the characters of the hemipeuis, but in the prominent 

 rostral plate it resembles the S. neovidii D. & B.

PATELLA KERMADECENSIS. 

 BY HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



In October, 1893, the writer received from E. W. Roper, Esq., of 

 Revere, Mass., two specimens of a very large and ponderous species 

 of Patella, which Mr. Roper had obtained from a New Zealand col- 

 lector, to whom they had been brought from the Kermadec Islands. 



Upon comparing these shells with the collection of Patellid^e in the 

 Museum of the Academy, and with the recent monograph of the 

 group in the Manual of Conchology, it became evident that they 

 represented an undescribed species. At Mr. Roper's request, a brief 

 description was prepared for publication, which some months later 

 appeared in the "Nautilus," under the name Patella kermadecemis. 

 After this description was printed, but before the number containing 

 it was generally distributed, the writer (in his capacity as Editor of 

 the "Nautilus''), received a description of the same species, under 

 the same name, from Dr. \Vm. H. Dall, the distinguished malacolo- 

 gist of the National jNIuseum. As Ball's specimens are more de- 

 pressed than those described by myself, and his series includes young 

 shells preserving the sculpture, I have therefore, quoted his descrip- 

 tion in full below, and have reproduced drawings of his type, kindly 

 supplied by him, on plate VII. 



Some time previous to the publication of the original description, 

 Mr. Geo. W. Taylor of Victoria, B. C, a gentleman who has de- 

 voted special attention to the Patellidte, received specimens of the 

 same species, apparently from the same original source. He prepared 

 a description of them, but not being thoroughly satisfied of the 

 novelty of the form, delayed publication.' 



The species has also been noticed by Mr. John Brazier, well-known 

 for his life-long labors on the Australian mollusca. Mr. Brazier 

 formed a theory that these limpets were not from the Kermadec Is- 

 lands, but from South Africa ; and as the specific name kermadecen- 



' Mr. Taylor submitted one of his young shells of this species to the junior 

 editor of the "Nautilus," who showed it to me. I did not recognize in it the 

 P. kfrmadc'censis, so diftercnt are the young from the ponderous, corroded adult 

 shells which alone I had seen. 




1894.] NATUKAr. SCrKNCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 209 



sin woiikl in that case-be a luisuonier, he proposed to re-narae the 

 form Patella Fihbnji Brazier.' Since Mr. Brazier has given no 

 proof whatever in support of his hypothesis, and as we liave every 

 reason to believe it without foundation in fact, the necessity for this 

 pro|X)scd change of name is not apparent. 



In support of the original statement that P. kermadecensis inhabits 

 the Kermadec Islands, I am now able to quote the following passages 

 from a letter' received from my friend Charles Hedley, of the Aus- 

 tralian Museum : — 



"There can be no doubt tliatit [I\ kermaderensi-^l really inhabits 

 tiie Kernuulecs. 



" Mr. Charles Spencer, of Auckland, a leading New Zealand 

 collector, has just given me a most circumstantial account of it. He 

 says a great number were collected at the orders and by the crew of 

 Capt. Fairchild, of the government steamer " Hinemoa," while on an 

 ofKcial visit to Kaoul, or Sunday Island, the principal island of the 

 group. Most of these passed into the hands of Mr. Eric Craig, a 

 natural history dealer of Auckland, who distril)uted them to various 

 correspondents throughout the world." 



The literary history of this species is thus seen to have been much 

 more extensively exploited than its natural history. The references 

 to the books are as follows: —

P. keniiadecensls may be compared with two previously descril)ed

 not doubt, quite distinct. The original description, by which alone

 et couverte de tubes de serpules.

The dimensions given by Lesson, 5x7 inches, indicate a much more 

 oblong shell than any known specimens of lermadecen.iis, and the 

 coloring of the interior differs also. The difference in outline may 

 be most readily appreciated by plotting an ovate contour with the 

 axes 5x7 inches, and comparing with a contour of kermadecena'is. 



P. pica Reeve, if it is the same as P. kermadecensis, is a very 

 young specimen. The description and illustrations may be found in 

 Reeve's Couchologia Iconica, vol. viii, pi. xix, figs. 45 a-c. The 

 type, if still preserved, is in the British Museum, and should be 

 compared with young specimens of kermadecensis of the same size. 



The types of P. kermadecensis may be described as follows : — 



Shell large, thick and heavy ; round-ovate, slightly narrowed in 

 front, broadly rounded behind, conical, the apex central. Altitude 

 of cone nearly equal to half the breadth of the base, but decidedly 

 less than half the length; slopes straight. Surface dull and much 

 corroded by various parasitic growths, calcareous alga^, and young 

 Patellas, apparently of the same species, leaving but little of the 

 original sculpture, which seems to have consisted of numerous rather 

 low, radiating ribs, the interspaces and ribs covered with a secondary 

 sculpture of radial riblets. 



Interior whitish, more or less tinted with gray or dull reddish; 

 the muscle impression and the edge of the shell either white or deep 

 salmon colored. Border of shell slightly crenulated by the external 

 sculpture. Muscle-impression strongly marked, roughened, and 

 either impressed, or thickened and like a shelf or terrace. 



Dimensions of two specimens: — 



Length lo6, breadth 116, altitude 55 mm. 



119.5, " 104, " 50 " 



These shells are decidedly more elevated than the exaiii})U'S in the 

 collection of Mr. Taylor, who writes as follows : — 



'• My suite of kermadecensU consists of two full-grown shells and a

series of twelve others raugiiii; from 75 mm. down to 6 mm. in length. 

 The large ones are respectively 180 x 109 x 41 mm. and 130 x 109 x 

 34 mm. , being both considerably flatter than the specimens described 

 by Mr. IMlsbry. 



"All my specimens are distinctly narrowed in front, and in this 

 particular the species differs essentially from P. patriarrha, which is 

 very rouml in outline. I have a specimen of patriarcha exactly the 

 same iridfh as the two shells above mentioned, namely, 109 mm., 

 but it.< letHjth is only 119 mm. Our species is further distinguished 

 by its sculpture from both pafrlarcha and mexiciinn — the ribs being 

 narrower and much more numerous than in pa</-i«rc/ta and decidedly 

 heavier than in mexicaiia. Every 5th or 6th rib in the adult shell 

 seems to be more prominent."^ 



Dr. Wni. H. Dall's description of younger and less eroded exam- 

 |)les than the types, here follows : — 



'■'■ Patellii (Helcioniscusf) kennadecensis. Soft parts unknown, ])ut 

 the aspect of the shell is that of a Heleioni-'^cas." 



'^ Shell large, depressed or only moderately elevated, porcellanous, 

 radiately sculptured, with the apex of the shell slightly anterior to 

 the center, erect, blunt (or eroded); color outside orange-yellow, 

 sometimes more or less scorched with purplish- black, obscurely con- 

 centric or radiating in its disposition, frecjuently asymmetrical ; in- 

 side polished opaque-white, cream color, or even orange color, witii a 

 very narrow colored margin of orange, white, or black, following the 

 tint of the exterior ; the muscular impre-ssions not polished, sometimes 

 darker orange than the rest, the enclosed area usually much the same 

 color as that outside the scars, but sometimes lighter or with faint 

 brown or flesh colored stains irregularly distributed ; muscular scars 

 catenate, not symmetrical, with about seven segments on each side; 

 an obscure line, probal)ly indicating the scope of the mantle is visi- 

 ble witiiin the coloreil margin and this is emphasized to the left of 

 and ill front of the liead, where a strongly marked sinus extends to- 

 ward the apex close to and in front of the left arm of the pedal scar 

 and ceasing at the junction of tlie latter with the scar of the mantle 

 ov(rr the head ; this is distinctly indicated in all the specimens but is 

 less prominent in the younger specimens, and recalls the sinus of

what more so in the young than in the adult; external sculpture of 

 small, somewhat irregular rounded riblets, with equal or wider inter- 

 spaces, each third (fourth, fifth or sixth) riblet being somewhat larger 

 and more elevated than the others and often duplex; of these larger 

 ribs there are twenty or less on each side ; all the ribs are normally 

 rounded, and except where ol)viou5ly broken by accidents due to 

 exigencies of growth, do not appear scaly or nodulous, though some- 

 times more or less keeled ; basal outline, apart from sculptural crenu- 

 lations, approximately oval, the anterior always narrower than the 

 posterior end. Lon. of shell 135; Lat. 112; Alt. 33 mm. The 

 distance from the apex to the anterior margin, horizontally, 63 mm. 



"Some specimens are over six inches in length and proportionately 

 solid. The species seems to be one of the largest limpets known. 

 Although the nearest land is New Zealand, the shell has none of the 

 aspect so characteristic of the limpets of that region, but recalls 

 rather those of East Africa and the China seas. Patella pitriareha 

 Pilsbry, has much the same general aspect, though the sculp- 

 ture is wholly ditierent. Paielli harbara L. has the discrepancy 

 between the primary and secondary radii much greater, and the 

 margin conse(|uently stellate. The sinus near the anterior left hand 

 margin is not confined to this species but may be found in many 

 Patellidte; still, few species have it so strongly emphasized as in 

 P. kennadecensis. Its origin is doubtful, and can be cleared up best 

 by a study of the living animal. The larger specimens are usually 

 badly eroded, only the younger ones show the surface well, and the 

 islands Twe understand from Mr. Fulton, from whom the specimens 

 were received) are visited but once a year. These circumstances 

 may account for the overlooking of so large a shell by untrained 

 collectors."

A CONTRIBUTION TO THE LIFE HISTORY OF THE ALLEGHENY CAVE 

 RAT, NEOTOMA MAGISTER IJainl. 



BY SAMUEL N. RIIOADS. 



lu 1857, Prof. vS. F. Baird described a fossil Neotomn from the bone 

 caves of Pennsylvania in a final parairrapli nnder caption of Neotoma 

 occidenf(tlu, on page 498 of his work on the Mammals of Nortli 

 America. It reads : "The bone caves of Pennsylvania have fnrnished 

 me with several lower jaws of a fossil Xeofoma considerably larger 

 than the largest specimen even of any recent species which I have 

 seen. The body could not have been less than twelve inches in 

 length ; it differs from the others in the wider and more massive 

 molars, the lobes of which are all more nearly equal than in tlie rest, 

 and all rounded, not angular. The inner and outer sides of the 

 molars are very nearly symmetrical, and the indentations or folds of 

 nearly equal depth. The axis of the condyloid process is quite ob- 

 lique, and the condyle below the level of the coronoid. The species 

 may be called N. mafjisfer.'" 



In 189;> Mr. Witmer Stone received two specimens of a cave rat 

 in the flesh from South Mountain, Cumberland County, Pennsylva- 

 nia, taken at an elevation of 2,000 feet, at a point known as Lewis's 

 Rocks, about six miles from the village of Pine Grove in the same 

 county. These he described' under the name Neotoma peuusylvauica, 

 making no comparisons in the description between his new species 

 and y. inagister, the type specimens of which came from a valley cave 

 about 20 miles distant from Lewis's Cave. Since then a large series 

 of "fossil" specimens of N. mdfjister, included among the com|)l{'te 

 collections from Ilartman's and Durham Caves, and on which Prof 

 Joseph I><?idy based liis paper on " Fossils in Caves and Crevices of 

 the Limestone Kocksof Pennsylvania," ' have been found stowed away 

 in the Museum of the Academy of Natural Sciences. Among them 

 is a mandible of X. motjisfcr, labeleil IVom " Harrisburg Cave," pre-

these the Academy possesses another collectiou from Hartman'sCave, 

 made last year by Mr. H. C. Mercer during his re-exploration of 

 that cave/ and containing among others the only extant cranium of 

 magider in which the nasal bones are intact. There are also two 

 alcoholic specimens of a cave rat from Wythe Co., Virginia, col- 

 lected in 1868 by Prof. E. D. Cope. These, together with Mr. 

 Stone's types of N. pennsylvanica, two stuffed skins of the same from 

 the Pennsylvania Alleghenies, and an alcoholic specimen shown me 

 from Mammoth Cave, Kentucky, by Mr. G. S. Miller, form the 

 basis of my examinations respecting the relationships, distribution, 

 and probable identity of magister and pennsylvanica. Prof Leidy 

 has enumerated the entire collections from these caves, among which 

 he records " 92 mandibular rami, 13 pairs of upper maxilhe, numer- 

 ous limb- bones," etc., of " Neoto'ma florldana,'' which, he states, 

 appear to accord with similar remains referred by Prof, Baird to a 

 supposed extinct^ species with the name of Neotovia magistei'." Most 

 of these still exist in the Academy. The Durham Cave material is 

 more scanty, but includes a more complete cranium (No. 3,542) than 

 any from the Stroudsburg Cave. This cranium lacks nasals, ptery- 

 goids, right squamosal, malar, and occipital bones, and is from a rat 

 hardly one year old. 



The subjoined table of measurements, in millimeters, of the best 

 of this material, together with those of N. floridana, kindly furnished 

 me by Messrs. H. H. & C. S. Brimley, may be considered ample 

 enough for a critical comparison between the forms in question : —

216 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



Prof. Baird's description of magister aims to distinguish it from 

 all forms of the genus known to him by its large size and massive, 

 rounded molars. So far as I have examined the species of Xeotonvt 

 now known, and which number five times as many as were recognized 

 in Baird's dav, I find magider to be somewhat larger than any other. 

 It ha.< a comparatively short tail, but the length and girth of body 

 considerably exceeds that of other species whose total length may 

 average more than in a series of magisier. It is a satisfaction to thus 

 confirm the appropriateness of Baird's specific name. As to its 

 cranial characters, magisfer presents us with the largest skulls I have 

 examined in this genus, but the comparative size and shape of the 

 molars as given by Baird cannot be said to be diagnostic. It is 

 probable when Prof. Baird made these comparisons he only possessed 

 specimens of old individuals, in which this peculiarity of the molars 

 is always apparent, and does not vary to any great extent among 

 specimens of N. fiisHpes, florklann, or cinerea of same age, and is of 

 the same general character in all. The same may be said of the fold- 

 ing and indentations of the enamel in very old specimens. Younger 

 specimens of magider, both fossilized and recent, show a very close 

 resemblance in their molar dentition to floridaaa and cinerea of 

 same age. The incisors and rostral portion of the skull in magider, 

 however, are much wider and heavier than in any other Xeotoma I 

 have seen. Compared with N. floridanu (to which magister both 

 physically and geographically shows the closest alliance) it may be 

 noted from the table of measurements that the recent and fossil crania 

 of the cave rat are much larger than in the wood rat. In super- 

 ficial proportions the diflference is less apparent, but in the following 

 particulars their divergence is constant and specific : — 



1. The post- palatal notch of magider is acuminate, often shar})ly 

 so, at other times bearing in its apex a minute, blunt point, 

 directed posteriorly; in floridana the post-palatal margin is In'oadly 

 and evenly rounded or nearly square cut between the opposing last 

 molars, the pterygoids being more divergent and relatively shorter. 

 2. In magider the slits separating the palatal from the sphenoid bones 

 are often nearly anchylosed ; in floridana they are more widely sejia- 

 rated. 3. The interorbital depression and supraorbital ridges of the 

 frontals in younger specimens of magider are very decided ; in flori- 

 dana nearly obsolete. 4. As above stated, the greater relative 

 breadth of incisors, maxillaries, and nasals in magister. 




1894.] NATrKAL SCIENCKS UF I'lIILADEI-PJIIA. 217 



Externally, magister is most conspicuously known from t^orlihnui 

 by its deusoly hairy and sharply hicolored tail. This inombcr 

 is relatively shorter than in florhlann, and the lateral divergence 

 of the longer hairs gives it a depressed appearance, which is almost 

 exactly reproduced in half-grown examples of the bushy tailed ash- 

 colored rat of the northern Rocky Mountains. The correlation of 

 development in this character aud in the shorter ears, between ani- 

 mals of such widely separated but similar environments, both of 

 which trace their ancestry to progenitors inhabiting a semi-tropical 

 climate, is a significant fact. In body colors, ma(jlMer is readily dis- 

 tinguished from floridana by its plumbeous grayness and lack of 

 brown above, by the fulvous areas of opposing sidas of lower hind 

 neck reaching nearly across the throat, and by the blackish areas 

 around the eyes and at base of whiskers. 



It therefore appears that we have in N. magider a large cave rat, 

 quite distinct from the wood rat of the Gulf States, and which, so 

 far as existing remains are known to us at this date, is-the same ani- 

 mal as X. peiinsi/Jvanica Stone. 



As it now stands, however, the case is a peculiar one. The evi- 

 dence in fiivor of making petmsyhKinica a synonym is conclusive so 

 far as it is based on known facts, but the impossibility of ascertaining 

 the perislial)le external characters of those indiviiluals whose fossil- 

 ized remains formed the types of Prof. Baird's description, estab- 

 lishes a possibility that they represent an animal we would now 

 consider separable from the living form. Were the specific pecu- 

 liarities of the diHerent members of the genus Neotoma based on 

 cranial characters of c<»nstant value, the identity of magider and 

 pmiisi/buinifa would be clearly estai>lished by my examinations, 

 but as yet they have not i)een so distinguished by anatomists. 

 That it is probable good cranial characters can be I'ormulatetl for 

 the s|)e<"ies of this genus deserving recognition, 1 teel confident. ( )n 

 this basis, as recently applied i)y Dr. Merriam, ' it is apparent to 

 me that ;*'///(.•<///('';//*></ will not stand as a specific ntime, nor can it, 

 from the very nature of tiie ca.sc, l)e a candidate for siii>-specific

2. The Sonoran derivation of the Genus Xeotoma indicates its com- 

 paratively recent post-glacial advent into Xorth Temperate latitudes. — 

 Dr. Coues has attempted to trace, by the scant evidence then known 

 to him, the probable derivation from mtigister of the four existing 

 species of Xeotoma recognized in the ^Monograph of North American 

 Rodentia.'' The evidence now had, exactly revei'ses his hypothesis. 



3. The presence of living X. magister in the caves where fossilized 

 remains of same occur in various stages of preservation and antiquity. — 

 Magister does not now exist in the Carlisle valley cave. It may have 

 existed there in the early colonial days of Pennsylvania, or its life 

 there may date back to a time when the crests of South Mountain,

1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF HIIII.ADEM'H I A. 219 



now infested by it, were yet in the loosening grip ot" the ice age. Mr. 

 Paret writes me that he has no knowledge of the recent existence of 

 a cave rat in Hartnian's Cave. I liave been told that such an 

 animal is found among the clitfs and rocky crests of the Kittatinny 

 range, on the opposite side of the Delaware River, in Warren Co. , 

 New Jersey. 



4. Tlw kick of any trace of gixncinc/ upon the boiiex of mavunals, 

 from Hartmaii'.-i Cave, not now existing in America, as contrasted with 

 the iinifornih/ rat-eaten condition of the bonc)^ of those k)ion'n to have 

 inttabited Pennsylvania in the history of man. — The specimens of 

 Dicotyles peniisy Ivan lens and Castoroides ohioensis from Hai'tman's 

 Cave are nngnawed, as is likewise the ramus of caribou there taken, 

 while those of the beaver, elk, and bison, animals recently extermi- 

 nated in Pennsylvania, show the unmistakable marks of a rat's 

 teetli. 



It, therefore, appears that tlie evidence, so far as we know it, tends 

 only to establish the identity of the fossil Neotoma of Bainl with the 

 species now living in the same localities. On the other side the 

 argument is purely i)resumptive, and if we admit a distinction (no 

 differences being proven) between magister and pennsylvanica, the fos- 

 silized remains of foxes, wolves, beavers and other animals found in 

 association with the rat bones in the Carlisle and Stroudsburg caves 

 are as fully entitled to specific separation from their living Penn- 

 sylvania representatives as are the rats. No one, who would be un- 

 willing to thus follow such a precedent to its logical conclusion, can 

 consistently endorse the precedent. Had Prof. Baird been aware of 

 the facts as we now know them, the question would never have arisen, 

 or if it had, would have been decided in the case of the rat as it 

 was decided in that of the fox and wolf and beaver. 



Habits and distribution of Neotoma magister. — I paid a visit to 

 I^ewis's Kocks, the type locality of Mr. Stone's specimens of penn- 

 sylvanica, in the spring of lH!).'i, for the purpose of obtaining some 

 knowledge of the animal's habits. The rocks lie at the top of the 

 mountain and form the culminating jioint of a rocky outcrop, topping 

 the ridge for a mile or more in this locality, and which at intervals 

 Jissnmes a very rugged and castellated outline. The cave rats live 

 in tlie more inaccessible fissures and clefts of these rocks, selecting 

 for their rlormitories those which arc most securtf from the a|)proacli 

 or entrance of the predaceous animals which abminil in such situa-

tions. The entrances and passageways to these abodes are loosely 

 barricaded with sticks, stones, leaves, feathers, bones, horse and cow 

 droppings, buttons, glass, tin, egg-shells, cartridge-cases, and other 

 cast- away evidences of the sojourn of men and animals in this spot. 

 Many of the sticks are three to four feet long and an inch in diam- 

 eter, and must have required the concerted strength of several rats to 

 move, and not a little ingenuity to convey up and over the precipitous 

 clefts to their resting-place. The bones were those of deer, smaller 

 carnivora, birds, and other animals brought thither by man and beast, 

 or which had sought refuge among the clefts to die. I was unable, 

 from the natui-e of their fastnesses, and lack of time and proper im- 

 plements, to penetrate their dormitories, and owing to the pilfering 

 foxes, lost the only specimens that got into my traps. One half- 

 grown rat was seen running among the rocks. It was lighter gray 

 than adult specimens. Quantities of gnawed acorn hulls strewed 

 their hiding places, and were the chief evidences of the diet of this 

 species. These acorns grow abundantly on the scrub oaks, (^uercm 

 hauisteri, characteristic of these mountain tops. While it« main 

 food supply is vegetable, no doubt these rats are omnivorous, and 

 take every opportunity to satisfy their carnivorous appetite. The 

 gnawed condition of the bones of recent mammalia found in Peim- 

 sylvania cave dejwsits, is, to my mind, almost solely due to the work 

 of this quadruped, a critical examination of these marks showing 

 not only their rodent origin, but that their size and character fit no 

 tooth so well as that of magister. 



I am informed by Mr. H. C. Mercer (whose recent explorations of 

 Virginia caves has been ably outlined in a Bulletin of the Univer- 

 sity of Penns^'lvania, dated July 4, 1894) that the Virginia cave 

 rats build a sub-globular nest of grass, etc., on the cave floor, and 

 that these are so well made internally as to resist considerable kick- 

 ing about. Prof E. D. Cope, who secured the two specimens of 

 inaf/ider tabulated above, from a cave in Wythe Co., Virginia, tells 

 me that these nests are placed at or near the sides of the cave, and 

 are often large enough to fill a bushel basket. 



The habitat of living Xeofoma marjider cannot be verified by a 

 representative series of specimens from connected localities, but from 

 those now in possession, and the testimony of several of my corre- 

 sp(»iideiits in Pentisylvania and New Jei-sev, it is co-ordinate witli the

 New Jersey. 



The specimens of Xevtonia taken on the Hudson River, by .John 

 G. Bell, and mentioned by IJaird in his work on mammals, are, ap- 

 parently, from the table of measurements, large X. Jioridand. 



It is doubtful if A'. marjiMer ever inhabited the State of New York, 

 and the specimens taken by Mr. Bell were probably imported in a 

 cargo of southern lumber. 



Probably the eai'liest reference to the Allegheny cave rat in 

 literature is made by the Swedish naturalist, Peter Kalm, in 1755*, 

 in his book of Travels, where he quotes John Bartrara, of Philadel- 

 phia, as authority for the existence of such an animal in the " Blue 

 Mountains." This reference is quoted by Pennant in his History 

 of Quadrupeds, page 441, under caption of "American- Rat," as fol- 

 lows : " Mr. l^artram (in Kalm's Trav., ii, 48) mentions the rat, but 

 does not determine the species, which lives among the stones and 

 caverns in the Blue Mountains, far from mankind: comes out at 

 night, and makes a terrible noise, but in very severe weather keeps 

 silent within its holes." William Turton in his Systema Natune 

 (1802, p. 80) enumerates an American rat to which he gives the 

 name Mh." (imericaniis. His description is mainly a quotation of 

 Pennant's account, above cited, of the same animal. Were not 

 Turton's binomial antedated by the Mas agrariiis var. ameriraiinx of 

 Kerr (Syst. Nat., 1702, 281), now accepted as the first tenable name 

 for the eastern white- footed mouse, Silomi/s ameiicaiiKx (Kerr), it 

 would have a strong claim, in the light of our present knowledge, to 

 precedence over Baird's specific name, imu/ider.

FURTHER NOTES ON THE EMBRYONIC WHORLS OF THE 

 MURICIDJE. 



n\ FHANK C. I5AKKK. 



lu 1800 I described in these Troceedings (pp. (5<)-72) the eni- 

 brvonic- whorls of a miniber of spec-ies of this most interesting family; 

 and in the Proceedings of the Rochester Academy of Science (Vol. 1 , 

 1891, pp. 129-133) I added several species to those already described. 

 From that time nntil a few months ago, I was unable to find perfect 

 material in any collection under my charge. Some months since, 

 however, I discovered perfect specimens of Miirex froseheli and 

 Eiipleiira caadata, with the nuclei intact. Descriptions of these are 

 given below: — 

 Murex troscheli, Lischkc. (Fig. 1.) 



The nucleus consists of two and a half smooth, glossy, hyaline 

 whorls, gradually increasing in size; a carina begins at the apex and 

 encircles the l)ase of the whorls near the suture below; it terminates 

 in the fourth spiral line of the after growth. 

 There is a considerable varix at the junction 

 of the nucleus with the after growth. The 

 whorls succeeding the nucleus are crossed by 

 four spiral, beaded lines; spinose varices be- 

 gin on the fourth whorl. 



The only species whose nucleus approaches 

 that of the present species is Miirrj- plicifcrn--< (^Sowb. ), but tliat is 

 higher in pro|)ortion to its widlli and somewhat diHerently shaped. 

 The number of whorls are the same in both species. 



It may not be out of place to indicate here the species of which 

 the nuclei have been described and figured. Descriptions of these 

 may !»<■ found in the Proceedings spoken <>f above. The species

The nucleus of this species consists of one and a half semitrans- 

 parent, glossy whorls; there is no indication of a carina upon them; 

 the tip of the first whorl is immersed in the succeeding whorl and is 

 bent down to one side; the first half of the whorl, 

 looking at the lateral outline, is about half the 

 size of the portion succeeding it; the whorls are 

 well-rounded and full ; the sculpture, consisting of 

 spiral and longitudinal lines, begins very faintly 

 on the latter part of the second whorl and gradually 

 grows stronger as the shell increases in size; there 

 are about fourteen longitudinal lines to each whorl, after leaving 

 the nucleus, which are crossed by two heavy spiral lines. 



I have seen four specimens of this species, and the characters ex- 

 pressed above appear to be tolerably constant. The present species is 

 the only one of this genus, which I have been able to examine. It 

 will be interesting to know just how variable or constant the nuclei 

 are in the difllerent species. This is a field which needs a great 

 amount of ori2:inal investigation.

A NEW SUBFAMILY OF MURINE RODENTS— THE NEOTOMINiE WITH 



DESCRIPTION OF A NEW GENUS AND SPECIES AND A SYNOPSIS 



OF THE KNOWN FORMS. 



liY I)K. C. IIAIM" .Mi:i;i;i A.M. 



A study of tlie rich collectious of American Murine Rodents 

 brought together by the U. S. Department of Agriculture, shows 

 that the genus Xeotoma is one of a group of closely allied forms 

 which differ so radically from the tuberculate crowned Murines, with 

 which they have been commonly associated, that the propriety of 

 separating them as an independent subfamily seems evident. 



The tniparallcleil series of Mexican Rodents collecte<l by Mr. E. 

 W. Nelson in connection with his work for the Division of Ornith- 

 ology and ^[ammalogy of the I'. S. Department of' Agriculture, 

 contains a large number of wood rats, several of which are not 

 properly referable to the genus Xeotoma. Two of these were de- 

 scribed by me sometime ago, under the names Xeiiomii!< nelt^onl anil 

 Xeotoma a/leiii,^ tlu' former being made the type of a new genus. 

 lu the original account of Xeotonn alleiil attention was calletl to the 

 circumstance that the crown of the last lower molar is shaped like 

 the letter S, instead of exhibiting two transverse Ioo|)s as usual in 

 the genus Xeotoma, and it was remarked liiat this peculiarity might 

 prove worthy of sul)generic recognition i p. KJT). In the course of 

 a subseijuent stuilyof the American wood rats, it was discovered that 

 the character in (luestion, which is one of great value, is correlated 

 with a nundier of important craniid ciianiclers, making it olivioiisly 

 undesirable to retain the animal longer in the genus Xeotoma. 

 Ameghino has described and figured two related rodents from the 

 I'umpean Pliocene deposits near X'ilhi de Liijan, in the province 

 of Buenos Ayre-S, which he has named I'li/.tsitjthoi ax ihijaiis- and 

 TnttumiK nf/waK.^ Mis de.scription of the former is ba.^eil on the

vidual; that of the latter is based ou a fragment of the maxilhiry 

 containing the upper molar series. At first, I was inclined to regard 

 Ameghino's specimens of I^ipmphonis (tig. \c) and Tretoimjs (fig. 2) 

 as the lower and upper jaws of the same animal, and to look upon 

 ray ^ Neotoma^ alleni (fig. \e) as congeneric therewith.' But sub- 

 sequent study has convinced me that Ptyssophonis and Tretoiii)j.< are 

 probably distinct, though closely related genera, and that the living 

 species formerly described as A", alleni, together with the new species 

 here named vetulus, represent a third genus of the same group. For 

 this genus I propose the name Hodomys. Hodomys is a more recent 

 type than Ptyssophonis, less specialized than Xenomys, and more 

 ancient than Neotoina. 



So far as dental characters go, the group of genera under con- 

 sideration ( P^i/.s.v-oj;/io/w/s, Tretomys, Hodomys, Xenomys, and Xeotoma) 

 pix'sents nearly every important step in the evolution of the modern 

 genus Xeotoma from the Cricetine series. Siginodon seems to be the 

 connecting link that bridges the gap between the tuberculate toothed 

 Murine subfamily C'ricetinte and the flat topped prismatic crowned 

 Neotominai, by which name it seems proper to designate the new 

 subfamily, comprising the 5 genera above enumerated.' Siguiodon 

 should be looked upon as an ancestral rather than a contemporary 

 type. It is almost ou the dividing line between the tuberculate and 

 flat crowned groups, and is probably on or near the trunk line 

 along which the Xeotominre branched off from the tuberculate series. 

 It is evidently an ancient type, dating back to the Pliocene at least, "^ 

 since which period it has not undergone very marked changes. In 

 early life Slyinodon has the outer ends of the loops elevated, forming 

 half tuberculate grinders, much as in the American Cricetines, but 

 the projecting loops are soon worn down, leaving flat grinding sur- 

 faces (fig. 1(7). The loops, however, remain closely a|)pres.sed or 

 even soldered together, never standing out freely as in Xeotoma and 

 Arvicola. 



* While of this iniiid I stated, in a recent paper on the geiuis Xeoloina. that 

 the species of Wood Kats haviii}; ilie crown of the last lower molar shaped like 

 the letter S. were transferred to Xha iiiiuns Plvssopliorus of Amejihino (I'roc.

' It is prohable that several other animals described by Anieghino belong to 

 the NeolomiHcc — such as Bolhriouiys and some of the species referred to the 

 genera Oxyiniclerus, Holocliil>ts.-An(\ ' Habhrotrix'' (= Ahrolliri.xr).

Whatever the future may .show the exact genetic interrehui()U^^ of 

 these animals to be, it is evident that IHyssophonis is the more primi- 

 tive type; Trctomi/s and Hodom;/.^ seem to represent more advanced 

 stages in the evolution of the group, while Xeiio)ni/-i and Xeotoma 

 are more specialized. Xetio)nii--< retains more primitive characters 

 than Xeotoma, and conso(iuently must l)e looked uj)on as nearer 

 TfeUnnijs, with which it agrees closely in dental characters; on the 

 other hand, it is a far more specialized type than Xivfonia and can in 

 nowise be regarded as holding a place in the direct line of descent 

 between /Y(/6>r>/>/io/w<>- and Xeotoma. 



The discovery of complete skulls of Ptyssophoriis and Tretomys may 

 show that the line of generic separation should he drawn between 

 Ptya-foplwrus, on the one hand, and Tretoniy.'^ and Xt'iioiiiiis on the 

 other; and believers in comprehensive genera may uniti' the two 

 latter as subgenera of a single genus, the relation of which to 

 Xeotoma woulil he that of a specialized ancestral type to a modern- 

 ized type. 



The fact tluit of the living genera only a single species of Xniomys 

 and two of Jlodonnj.-' have been disi-overed, while nearly thirty sjiecies 

 of Xeotoma are known, is strong evidence that Hodomyx and XeiiomyK 

 are survivors of the past, bridging over the gap between Pty.ixophorus 

 and Xcotovui, and that the latter genus is now at or near the height 

 of its development. 



Irrespective of the interrelations of these animals, it is evident 

 that, collectively, they form an important though not highly special- 

 ized subdivision of the Murine series, standing somewhat apart from 

 the others. While they resend)le the Arvicolinte in ^onie rc-^pi-cls, 

 they diller in numerous important characters and cannot be regarded 

 as intermediate between the Arvicolimc and Cricctina'. On tin- con- 

 trary, the Neotomina' and Arvicoliujeseeni to be independent otii-hoots 

 from the half-tuherculate crowneil Cricetines. .\mong the many ex-

 lowing are sntticient for present pur|)oses: —

 process of mandible narrow, everted, hamular, and thickened at end; 

 infracondylar notch low and deep. 



Subfamily NEOTOMINiE. 



Cranium not abruptly constricted in front of brain case, which is 

 oval, gradually narrowing into orbit ; orbital and temporal fossje 

 indistinguishable, without trace of separation; jugal wholly poste- 

 rior, forming insignificant part of zygoma and never reaching for- 

 ward half-way from squamosal root to maxillary j>late ; sagittal 

 area elongated, at least twice as long as broad ; angular process of 

 mandible broadly expanded vertically, inflected, not hamular, and 

 never thickened at end ; infra-condylar notch high and shallow. 



The dental characters of the Neotominte may be defined as fol- 

 lows : Molars '!^, prismatic, rooted or semi- rooted; the crowns flat, 

 their sides continuously invested with enamel which is folded on 

 itself in such manner as to present on each side of the tooth a series 

 of salient loo})S, alternating with re-entrant angles or interspaces 

 (figs. 1-5). M ', '-, and -^ , each with three salient loops and two

 loops and two re-entrant angles on outer side and four salient loops

 angles on each side \_Ptyssophorus resembles Su/modoii in having 

 the . antero-exterual re-entrant angle small] ; m ;^ variable, but 

 normally with two salient and one re-entrant angles on each side. 



The subfamily Neotominre comprises the genera Xeotoma, Xenomys, 

 Hodomys, Tretoinys, and PtysHophont.^ (and probably one or two 

 others). 



The Neotoniime may be distinguished from the Sigmodont ("rice-

 stage in the evt)lution of the enamel pattern. In Ameghino's single 

 specimen the re-entrant angles or grooves between the folds extend 

 vertically from crown to alveolus, as in the young of XcotoiiKi and 

 allied types. Whether they continue below the alveolus to the very 

 root of the tooth as in the Arvicolines, we are not infornu'd; but the 

 chai'acters of the jaw and molar crowns indicate that they do not. 

 The specimen is apparently immature and the teeth are probably 

 rooted or semi-rooted.

 states that the alveolar border is higher on the outer than inner side 

 of the jaw, and that m i is nearly as large as m ^ ii»<^ .{ together. 

 He gives the following measurements: length of molar series on 

 crowns, 5 mm.: on alveolus, (5; distance from incisor to m i, 5; 

 height of ramus at m ;<, o; distance from front of incisor to back 

 of last molar, 12. The incisor is short, but this may be an indi- 

 vidiuil peculiaritv. The hinder part of the mandible is broken off,

Specific- characters. — Most of the characters have been given 

 above, in the generic diagnosis. The molars are implanted .squarely 

 one in front of the other, the longitudinal axis of each tooth being 

 the same as that of the series collectively. In the other genera the 

 upper molars are implanted obliquely, the axis of m - and -^ sloping 

 outward as well as liackward from the axis of the series as a whole. 

 In Trefonn/s the posterior loop on the inner sitle and the anterior 

 loop on the outer side of m ^ and •'■ are more largely developed 

 than in the other genera, the result being that" on each .side all 

 of the salient loops of the series end nearly on the same plane. 

 Ameghino's measurements of the molar series are: Series, 5 nmi. ; 

 111 ', 2 mm.; m -, 1.6 mm.; m '^, 1.4 mm. The upper incisor is 

 1 mm. i>road and its face is very convex.

General characters. — This animal bears no close resemblance to 

 anv known species except Hodomys allciii from Mazanillo (on the o|> 

 posite side of Mexico), with which it shares the remarkable i>sha{)ed 

 last lower molar, peculiar audital bulUe, closed sphenopalatine vacui-

 plentifully mixed with black hairs; face gray; fore and hind feet 

 white : tail bicolor, blackish above, soiled white beneath ; under 

 parts whitish, clouded from plumbeous under fur and washed with 

 dull fulvous on sides of belly (and in one specimen on breast also).

 smaller, shorter, less angular, and differing further in the following 

 characters: rostrum and nasals shorter ; nasals narrower posteriorly: 

 interparietal shield lass quadrate and more elongated transversely; 

 incisive foramina shorter (falling considerably short of plane of m ' ) ; 

 palate proportionally longer ; audital bulhe smaller; frontals broader

Mr. Xelsou states that this species is rather coiunion about the 

 foot of the low cliHs aud rocky ledges on the hillsides east of Te- 

 hiiacau, aud that it lives iu deuse patches of Agave. Me says : "It 

 has the habit of makiug roads about its haunt.s very much after the 

 niauner of X. alleni. Well-defiued trails were fouud leading along 

 the hillside from rock to rock or to the cover of Agave patches, and 

 between neighboring groups of these plants. Under the shelter of 

 a maguey patch a network of trails could be frequently found by 

 forcing ones way among the spiny leaves. Like A', alleni, these 

 animals did not take grain bait, and were caught by placing traps 

 in their trails. No signs of the nest building habit, so common in 

 the genus Neotoma, were ol)served."

A'tuoiurs Merriam, Proc. Biol Soc. Wusliiii'.'toii. N'lI.Sipt. isicj, i:>ii-n)3 (T.vpr 

 from Uaeieiula Magdalena, Colinia, Mexim). 



Generic characters. — Skull murine; short; audita! liiilhf gnally 

 enlarged and inflated, broader anteriorly than j)osteriorly, wheel- 

 shaped, parallel, carotid foramen posterior to middle of bulhi and 

 inconspicuous ; s(juamosal not reacliing supraocci|)ital l)iit ending 

 anterior to plane of auditory meatus, except the slender posterior 

 spicule which reaches over meatus to mastoid ; orbital margins of 

 frontals produced laterally forming projecting supraorbital beads ; 

 lachrymals large ; interparietal large and transversely elongated ; 

 premaxilhe produced anteriorly forming a wing-like extension on 

 each side of anterior nares; angle of mandible short, moderately 

 expanded vertically, inflected; condylar ramus long and high, over- 

 topping coronoid process ; molars large and heavy ; truly rooted 

 (upper with three roots each; lower with two roots each); crowns 

 prismatic, made up of broadly rounded alternating salient loo|)s and 

 ojieu re-entrant angles or inter.>^paces ; crown of m ;t, shapt'd in 

 general like letter 8 but somewhat angular (fig. 4). 



Externally, Xeiioniijn resembles a small, highly colored wood rat, 

 with rather soft pelage and a large whili.-h spot over «'aeh eye. The 

 tail is neifrly as long as the head and itody. Nothing is known of 

 the haliits of these animals, except that tliey are iiocliiriial and live 

 in hollow trees.

and curving strongly upward and inward; the coronoid notch nearly 

 vertical; the angle inflected (hut not produced backward so far as 

 in Hodami/s) ; the incisors slender, meeting in a single sharp point; 

 the molars very large; and m ;^, shaped like the letter S. Xeiionti/s 

 differs from Hodoviys in having the mandible greatly reduced poste- 

 riorly; the condylar ramus longer and more slender, overtopping the 

 coronoid, and both coronoid and infracondylar notches larger at the 

 expense of the posterior part of the ramus, which is greatly reduced 

 thereby. In Xenomy^ the anterior base of the coronoid process 

 arises more anteriorly from the horizontal ramus, hiding the whole 

 of the last molar and posterior loop of the middle molar, while in 

 Hodomys it arises further back, exposing the anterior loop of the 

 last molar. (In Xeotoma the line commonly falls between m o and 

 :; ; in Ptyasophoriis, according to Ameghino's figure, it apparently is 

 further back, exposing most of m ■^.)

 head and body, well haired, particularly above; face ornamented by 

 a distinct whitish spot over each eye and a less distinct one under 

 each ear; color of upper parts rich fulvous; under parts white; ears 

 al)out half as long as the head and nearly naked (sparsely clothed 

 with fine, inconspicuous hairs); whiskers reaching back to shoulders; 

 fur soft. 



Color. — Upper parts fulvous or tawny-rufous, palest on the head 

 and brightest over the rump, flanks, and hips; back sparsely mixed 

 with black-tipped hairs; an ill-defined dusky ring around each eye, 

 above which is a whitish spot about as large as the eye itself; a less 

 distinct whitish spot just below the inferior root of the ear; upper 

 lips white, the white color extending up on the cheeks more than 

 half-way to the eyes; sides of face below eyes and ears washed with 

 fulvous; whiskers blackish; tail concolor, dark umber-brown all 

 round ; ui>per surfaces of feet whitish , more or less clouded with 

 dusky (varying considerably in the three specimens); under parts

The accompanying illustration (fig. 5) shows the two extremes 

 in pattern of m ' , and differences in the crowns of the other molars 

 also. The dominant type of m ' throughout the genus is similar 

 to that of y. teiiuicauda (fig. 5, c), a member of the iiiexicana series.

Neotoma is not in any sense a highly specialized type, but it is a 

 very compact genus, its most divergent branches hardly meriting 

 subgeneric recognition. Some of its members point strongly toward 

 derivation from Hodoiai/.-^, as may be seen in the Xcdow ii.'<-]\\ie au- 

 dital bulla- and other cranial characters of Xeotoinn piniixiilrinuca, 

 and in the high, upturned condyle of the jue-c/rr/u'/ group, but the 

 inunediate antecedent forms leading up to Xcofoma from Hoduiiij/s, 

 or some similar type, are not known. The oldest forms of whicli we 

 have any knowledge, those from the cave de|)osits of Missouri, Ken- 

 tucky, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, are fully modernized species of 

 Neotoiua proper. 



Of the living species, N. j^emmjliKuiica may be regarded as the 

 most priuntive, since it po.^sesses several characters, not shared by 

 the others, that point back to llodotaiis. Moreover, peiiii.fijlr mica is 

 more nearly internieiliate between the two .•subgenera — Xcofomti 

 l)roper and Teonoina — than any other known species, indicating that

the differentiation of the trunk line into these two groups proceeded 

 from a form at least very similar to pi'ini.-<i/lvaiiir(i. X. peiiii-fi/h'anicn 

 resembles Hodinni/s in the peculiar shape of the audital hulhe (which 

 are abruptly narrowed anteriorly), in the nearly closed spheno- pala- 

 tine vacuities, in the posterior production of the angle of the madible, 

 and in the strong inward and upward curvature of the condylar 

 ramus. It reseral)les Teonoma in the tbrinof the sagittal area, which 

 is kite-shaped, uarnnv, sharply angular, Ijroadest far back (on or 

 near plane of interparietal;, whence its sides curve al)ru))tly inward 

 and backward to the sides of the interparietal shield. It resembles 

 Teonoma further in the tendency to closure of the spheno-palatine 

 vacuities,'^ the great length of the rostrum, and the presence of a 

 long trough-like depression which occupies the entire length of the 

 frontal and hinder part of the nasals. 



That the absence of the spheno-palatine vacuity is a primitive 

 character — or perhaps it would be better to say, that the presence of 

 a vacuity is a modern character — is indicated by the fallowing facts: 

 (1) The ancestral genus Hiidoinijs has no vacuity ; (2) Xeiionii/.'<, an 

 early offshoot from the primitive Xeotomiiie stem, has very small 

 vacuities ; (3; Teonoma, an older type than Xeotoma proper, has the 

 vacuities closed or partly open ; (4) Xeotoma j)enii.-<ylvaiiica, the least 

 differentiated known member of the modern genus, has the vacuities 

 partly closed ; and finally (o) some of the modernized species have 

 the vacuities closed in early life though fully open in the adult. '^ 



In its geographic distribution the genus is restricted, so far as 

 known, to North America north of Ducnas, Guatemala." The spe- 

 cies are most numerous in Mexico and the southern United States. 

 The total numi^er of species here recognized, including the subfossil 

 X. mar/istt'i; is 22, in addition to which 10 subspecies are admitted. 

 It is prol)able that a few additional species will lie added, and tliat 

 some of the members of the mexirana group will be reduced to sub- 

 8j>ecific rank.

In 184o, J. E. Gray separated the l)ii.*hy tailed IVom tl\e round 

 tailed species, proposing the name Teonotna for the former. In a 

 recent communication I adopted the name for a suhirenus, and de- 

 fined the resulting two subgenera as follows : —

Tail commonly round, scant-haired and tapering, hut in one 

 species moderately bushy; hind feet small or moderate. 



Rostrum of moderate length, not more than one- third the length 

 of cranium; sagittal area usually rounded, the broade.st part always 

 considei'ably anterior to plane of interparietal, whence the sides curve 

 gradually backward to interparietal shield; spheno-palatine vacuities 

 always open. 



Subgenus TEONOMA Gray, 1843. 



Tconoma Gray, List Spec. Manim. British Museum, 1843, 117. Type Xcoloiiia 

 cincrca druiiiniondi ( Rieliardson ). from the Rocky Mts. in hit. 57°X. 



Tail very large, bushy, and somewhat di.<tichous, like a .squirrel's; 

 hind feet very large. 



Rostrum much elongated, measuring more than one-third the total 

 length of cranium; posterior roots of zygomata widely s})readiug; 

 sagittal area long, narrow, and sharply angular, its broadest part 

 far back, on or nearly on plane of anterior border of interparietal, 

 whence the sides bend abruptly back to interparietal shield; spheno- 

 palatine vacuities closed or open. 



In the sanie communication I proposed, for convenience in arrang- 

 ing the species, to subdivide Xeotoma proper into four minor groups, 

 "none of which is worthy of the distinction of subgeneric rank. 

 These groups may be designated, from a typical species in each, as 

 follows: (1 ) the leueochm group; (2j the me.cim»a group ; (8) the 

 rfe.se/'/o/-/(Hi 'group, and (4) the arizotnv group." 



In a recent paper on Cranidl Variations in Neidoma microjfiis,^'' 

 i)r. J. A. Allen criticises my use of the color of the teeth as a sub- 

 ordinate character, and goes on to state that the range of individual 

 variation in color in his series of X. nticropiis "covers the whole 

 range of variation for the genus." His subse(|uent remarks show

a total misapprehension of ray nieaninir, for instead of speaking of 

 the color of the teeth themselves he refers to the dirty coating on the 

 outside of the teeth. He says: "The black coloring consists to a 

 large extent of a superficial incrustation which teuils to scale oti in 

 flakes in the prepared skull, and its absence apparently may be due 

 sometimes to removal in the process of cleaning the skull for the 

 cabinet. In other words, the blackness is to some extent an acci- 

 dental or pathological condition, due probably more or less to the 

 particular character of the food or to the health of the animal." 

 But for this perverse interpretation of my very plain statement it 

 would not be necessary to explain that when I said "color of teeth 

 white or nearly white" I meant the teeth — the osteodentine and en- 

 amel — not the dirty deijosit that sometimes collects on the outside of 

 the teeth. l>ut after all, the peculiarity is one of little consequence 

 and was only mentioned by me after enumerating the characters by 

 which meml)ers of the lenrodoii^'' group may be distinguished from 

 others. 



The following list of the 22 species and 10 subspecies recognized 

 by me contains under each name: (1) reference to the original de- 

 scription; (2) the principal synonymy; ( •")) the type locality; f4) the 

 known geographic distribution. 



Descriptions of the s])ecies are not added because they are incluileil 

 iu a more formal and fully illustrated revision of the genus which 

 will i»c published later.

DESCRIPTIONS OF FOUR NEW SPECIES AND TWO SUBSPECIES OF 



WHITE-FOOTED MICE FROM THE UNITED STATES AND 



BRITISH COLUMBIA. 



BY SAMUEL N. RHOADS. 



The Nortli American genus SIfomiix, coniprisinsr tlie white- footed 

 or deer mice, has received accessions in the hist ten years which bring 

 the combined number of species and subspecies from twelve, in 1<S85, 

 to thirty-seven in 1SS4. It may appear presumptive to ofier for con- 

 sideration six additional names to this already rather appalling list 

 of rodents belonging to a single genus. It is somewhat assuring, 

 however, to read the statement of Dr. J. A. Allen,' in his paper on 

 Recent Progress in the Study of North American Mammals, that 

 most of these forms are not only "well founded," - but that he 

 is "cognizant of still undescribed forms entitled to recognition in 

 nomenclature.' ' 



It may be stated, that in every case the following diagnoses are 

 based on a critical comparison of both external and cranial char- 

 acters with a large series of allied forms from the same region, and 

 in the case of full species the separation has been mainly founded on 

 the characters of the skull. 



Sitomi/s inet/iirejiliahtx is represented by a single adult and two 

 young specimens in alcohol from northern Alabama. While it is 

 desirable that more specimens should be examined, its characters 

 diverge .so widely from its nearest geographic allies, I can offer no 

 apology for presenting it now. 



Sifomi/s liiiolnfii.s is based on a single individual from the Mohave 

 Desert, California, while a second si)ecimen from the Mohave River 

 in transitional jielage is provisionally referred to it. The collec- 

 tions of the Academy of Natural Sciences contain a large series of 

 Sitonnin from the neighboring regions of Southern ('alifornia, 

 and the ssime is imdoubtedly the case with the collections of the 

 Department of Agriculture; yet I find in iimolalitit no clo.xe corre- 

 spondence to any other mouse I have yet seen or read description of 



I I'loi. I.iim. S<,<.. N. v., IbUl. 




254 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



Sitoiii>i.-< lurroui iil(/'lliis is au easily recoiiiiized mountain race of 

 the louii'- and- naked tailed species, which I described a year ago from 

 the .San Bernardino Valley. 



Sitomi/.i macrorhinns and Sltonni!< keeiii were severally taken on 

 the mainland coast and outlying islands of northern British Columbia, 

 by the Rev. Mr. Keen, a missionary stationed on Graham Island of 

 the Queen Charlotte Group. Their separation from each other, and 

 from northwestern forms previously known, is based on an examina- 

 tion of more than one hundred skins and crania of Sitoiniis taken 

 by me in 1(^92 at numerous localities in British Columbia and 

 Washington, including a large series from Puget Sound at the type 

 locality of S. a. aii.^tera.-< ; also from Vancouver Island, Lulu Island, 

 and the Cascade Mountains of Washington and British Columbia. 



Slfo)iiiis anif'ricaiiHs artemistK is founded on a series similarly taken 

 by the writer in the arid region east of the Cascade Mountains in 

 southern British Columbia, comparisons being further made with 

 series of (S'(7o;»V>- from Lac La Hache in the boreal realms, 100 miles 

 farther noi'th, and with those captured in the Selkirk and Rocky 

 Mountain Ranges, eastward. Arfnni.'^id' is to the northern Great 

 Basin fauna what S. a. iichrasccitsi.i is to that of the northwestern 

 Great Plains. 



The color characters given for these northwestern species are of 

 greater diagnostic value, because nearly all the specimens were taken 

 in May, June, and July, a period when seasonal changes of pelage 

 are less pronounced than in a later or earlier period of the same 

 duration. 



Incidental to these studies, it is of interest to note the occur- 

 rence of a form, apparently inseparable from the Hudson Bay type 

 of Sitoini/s ainaricjinns arcticii.^, upon the higher mountain ranges 

 of southern British Columbia, thus adding a tifth member of the 

 genus to the varied fauna of this great Province.

 mer/arrplwlii.i to a thickened knoh rounded posteriorly and rising hut 

 slightly above the plane of the condylar shaft, and presenting a 

 strong resemblance to the articular terminus of the condyle ; in 

 other words, having not only the ajipearance but the character of a 

 miniature condyle set upon the base of the true one.

I have selected from a series of forty Florida S. <(. (/os.siiju'iihk and 

 a series of nearly two hundred typical S. uniericdnH.i , eight of the 

 largest fully adult crania of each form. Average measurements of 

 these, in the order just gis-en above for the skull of nicf/acrphaln.^ 

 are as follows : —

It will be seen that the Alabama species has a skull nearly five 

 millimeters longer than average adult antericainis. It is further- 

 more about four millimeters longer than the longest skull of a series 

 of three hundred of the (imrrirn mis <rrou\) which I have examined. 

 C'on>pared with i/ossi/pinKS, wh(.»se average, it will be seen, somewhat 

 exceeds tv|)ical niiu rlramts, the diHerences are still very great. The 

 type is a very old female, which was sent, in company with two young 

 (ap[)arently her own), among a miscellaneous collection ol" alcoholic 

 animals fi;om Jack.son ( ounty, northern Alahama. They were the 

 only specimens of SitDiniis sent by Mr. Sargent, and owing to his 

 subsequent ab.seuce from the State, I have been uMal)lc to secure any 

 more specimens, to determine if this l»e the |)rcvailing form in that 

 region. I have .since received a large whilc-iiintcc] inou-e from I'asco

County, Florida, whose characters so nearly duplicate those of the 

 Alabama specimen, I am inclined, in spite of its different faunal 

 position, to consider it the same. The colors given for iiicfjacephaliis 

 may be relied upon, though taken from a spirit specimen after dry- 

 ing. The good condition of the alcohol and the whiteness of the 

 belly hairs show them not to have been affected in the least by their 

 recent immersion. In the two half-grown young, accompanying the 

 type, the same increased relative size of the cranium, compared with 

 americaiin.s of same age, is noticeable.

 Col. by E. B. Herron. 



Description. — vSize smallest of the genus west of the Mississippi 

 River, with exception of S. tai/Jori. Tail and feet very short, the 

 former shorter than the body minus the head, much attenuated along 

 distal half, the dark upper stripe very ntirr(nv and not reaching tip. 

 Pelage very soft, long, and dense. Upper half of head and body of a 

 uniform grayish-ochre or fawn color, not darker dorsally nor more 

 ochraceous on sides. Under parts pure white, the hairs of chops 

 white to their ba.se, those of remaining under parts plumbeous 

 basally. A lanuginous tuft at superior base of ear colored like the 

 head, remainder of outer ear dusky gray, the hairs longest on anterior 

 border, very short and sparse posteriorly. Narrow, upper tail-stripe 

 dusky, like ears its color at base in decided contrast with the fawn of 

 rump. Hind feet and ankles white, the soles fully haired to proxi- 

 mal tubercle. Forelegs and feet white. Whiskers reaching tip of 

 recumbent ears. .Skull smaller than in (imi'ricanu.s, more nearly ap- 

 proaching ereinicu.% but relatively wider. Nasals wide, anterior to, 

 and bluntly wedged between, the nasal premaxillary processes, as in 

 '■riMinciis. 



The width of the mandible of ln.-ioUitus equals nearly half its 

 length, and the coi'onoid process is relatively nearly as large and 

 hooked as in Oiii/choiii>i.< ramoiin, in the first character resembling 

 ereinicm, and in both departing radically from aiiirrinnins. The an- 

 terior loop of the first upper molar is a strongly indented trefoil, the 

 inner foil being twice as large as the middle one, which, in turn, is 

 twice as large as the outer foil. 



Meamremenh. — Total length, \Q>^ mm; tail vertebne, 76; hind

This mouse, of which 1 have received but one specimen among 

 a considerable series of mammals from the same region, is strikingly 

 different from any Sitoini/s that I have seen or can find description 

 of. It is not merely a desert form of some group already known, 

 but if more specimens prove its characters, as given above, to be 

 constant, it represents a section intermediate in character between 

 Onjichoniii.i and Sitomi/.-<. Its relationships, however, are much closer 

 to Sitomys. In its six tuberculate hind feet, the elongate lower 

 molar, the prominent coronoid process, and proportionate length of 

 tail to body, iitsoi'das is a Bdiomiis,' but the trefoil character of its first 

 upper molar is in another direction. The subgenus Baiomj/s, sepa- 

 rated from Sifoiniis almost solely on its well- developed coronoid and 

 short tail, is of very questionable value, as many Sitomi/s show a 

 tendency to the first character which have very long tails while other 

 short-tailed species show the reverse. In fact a large series of 

 Sitomi/s amerlcauus from Pennsylvania and New Jersey, which I 

 have studied, show individual variations in these characters among 

 themselves, which suffice to very closely connect Balomi/s with the 

 typical form. In case further material should show the dental 

 peculiarity of visolatiis to be constant, I would propose that it be 

 placed in the subgenus Tri noikiiifomi/s (Suhgeu. nov.) with characters 

 as already given.

 set, Queen Clmrlotte Is., B. C, 1892. Col. by Rev. J. H. Keen. 



Description. — Size larger than S. americfuins ansterus, ears 

 smaller, feet much larger, tail more than the length of head and 

 body. Colors above, uniform grizzled blackish- brown lacking the 

 darker dorsal area so prominent in austeras. Feet and lower parts 

 ashy-white, abruptly defined against dark upper colors. Ears, 

 upper half of tail, and ring around eyes, sooty black. Fur dense 

 and short, this character and the colors of upper parts giving it an 

 Arvicoline cast. Skull large for size of body. Brain case relatively 

 very large, deep, and rounded, inflated behind above })lane of 

 the orbits as the skull rests on a horizontal surface, so there is a 

 decided descent from a point just anterior to the parietals toward the 

 nasal bones and a depression at the interorbital constriction. In all 

 other forms examined this horizontal elevation of the parietals is not 

 greater than that of the frontals between the orbits, and is often less. 

 The nasals are short, double- pointed, and broadly wedged posteriorly 

 and not reaching behind the na.«;o-premaxillary processes. The an- 

 terior zygomatic width is much narrower than the squamosal, and the 

 antorbital foramina are thereby much contracted, giving the skull a 

 more tapering, triangular contour than in allied forms. The ratio 

 of squamosal-zygomatic breadth to total length in keeni, expressed in 

 millimeters, is 14-3 to 26-3, in amteruff 12-5 to 25. In keeni the 

 greatest parietal breadth is 12*5, in aitsterus 11.

Five specimeus of this mouse, two adult and throe somewhat

 Fletcher, of the Canadian Experimental Farm, at Ottawa. ]\[r. 

 Fletcher received them from Mr. Keen, who resides on the Queen 

 Charlotte Islands. I take pleasure in naming" the animal alter its 

 discoverei*, and trust it may be some incentive to more extended 

 researches in this interesting and imperfectly known department of 

 northwest zoology. 



The specimens were sent in carholized spirits. The purity of the 

 white after drying them out, shows their colors not to have altered, 

 and indicates that a series of well-preserved skins would show ker)il 

 to he the darkest colored Slto)niis yet brought to notice, a condition 

 of affairs which our knowledge of their humid, insular environment 

 would lead us to expect.

 Skecna Uiver, British Columbia, July 20tl), ISflS. Col. by Hev. .1. II. Keen 



Description. — Size much larger than *S'. cunerianni.^. Tail con- 

 siderably longer than head and body, feet large, ears medium. 

 Colors much as in ketni (1. c. ), but grayer and lighter hued above, 

 without the sooty cast of Iceeni. The tail is more coarsely hairy and 

 the hairs longer than in hreni, forming a distinct pencil not seen in 

 that species. Skull, viewed above, of the same triangular type as 

 keeiii, due to its antorbital constriction, but departing widely from 

 any other Sitomi/s I have examined, in the great relative length of 

 the rostrum (or that portion of the skull anterior to the interorbital 

 constriction) to the total length of the skull. In all others examined 

 this dimension is less than that of the post interorbital region, taking 

 for the central point of measurement the narrowest constriction point 

 of the frontals. In mnrmrhinn^ this condition is reversed. The 

 relative length of the nasal bones in this species is not great, but the 

 slenderness of the rostrum and the anterior compression of the jugal 

 arch increases their apparent length and the relative prominence of 

 this portion of the cranium. Tiiese ditfcrences, coupled with the 

 large size of the skull, strongly detino inurnnhiiiiiH from any of its 

 geographic allies.

Two adult, nursing females of this species, wei'e sent to Mr. 

 Fletcher, of the Ottawa Experimental Farm, by Mr. Keen, and 

 were forwarded to me in spirits. Their grayness, large size, and 

 long tails serve to distinguish them externally from any other 

 boreal or northwestern form I know of Eight specimens of Sitomys, 

 trapped at an elevation of 6,000 feet, on the Cascade Mountains of 

 northern Washington, are, perhaps, referable to this species. They 

 depart therefrom in somewhat smaller size, but in all other respects 

 are much nearer to it than to unsterns, of Puget Sound. The climatic 

 conditions of the Cascades where these were taken, are, with the 

 exception of a more rigorous winter, quite the same as those pre- 

 vailing at Skeena Harbor, the type locality of macrorhlnus.

 Khoads. Ashcroft, Kritish Columbia, June 5th, 1892. Col. by S. N. E. 



Description. — Size large, exceeding typical a)nericanus. Tail 

 short, hardly equalling body without the head. Ears medium and 

 sparsely haired. The hind feet are small and densely haired to the 

 distal half. Colors above, tawny ash, inclining to fulvous on sides 

 and rump and darkening with an increase of blackish hairs along 

 the back. Upper third of tail sooty, the lower two-thirds white and 

 tipped with a pronounced pencil. Lower parts a soft, clear white, 

 with basal half of belly hairs plumbeous. 



Measurements. — Total length, 170 mm ; tail vertebra?, 70 ; hind 

 foot, 20 (average of 8 adults — Total, 164; tail, 68; foot, 20). 

 Skull — Total length, 26; basilar length, 20; zygomatic width, 102; 

 length of nasals, 11-1; incisor to post- palatal notch, 11; length of

The nearest ally of this subspecies is probably S. a. nebrascensiK, as 

 defined by Dr. Mearns,* from specimens taken at Calf Creek, Montana, 

 from which it differs in not having dark well-haired ears and in the 

 absence of white patches in front of ears. With nebraacensis it coin- 

 cides in short tail, larger body, long full pelage, hairy sole, and light 

 colors as contrasted with americanus of the east and aasterus of the 

 west. The Ashcroft specimens repi'esent the northern limit of a 

 Great Basin form of americanus, whose habitat probably extends far

iuto tlie United States, at least to southern Idaho, we.^terii Washing- 

 ton, and Oregon. Xebrascensis represents that of the western Plains. 

 It is probable that artemisioi is included in the list of "Hesperoimjs 

 leucopii",'' given by Dr. Merriara in N. American Fauna, No. 5, 

 from Idaho, which he states may "eventually merit separation into 

 two or three subspecies." 



AHemisice was taken in the open, semi-arid foothills and lower 

 mountain slopes around Ashcroft, their burrows often being situated 

 on a bare hillside, a mile or more from other shelter than that afforded 

 by the scant growth of dwarf sage, which here nearly reaches its 

 northernmost limit of existence. 



NOTK ox SiTOMYS AiMKKICANUS ArCTICUS. 



The series of White-footed Mice taken at Nelson, in the Selkirk 

 Mountains, B. C. , and at Field, in the Rocky Mountains, B. C. , at 

 elevations of from 3,000 to 5,000 feet, fit so well Dr. INIearns' diag- 

 nosis (vid. sup. cit.) of S. a. arctlcxs from the Hudson Bay Territory, 

 I feel almost assured, without the type before me, that they are the 

 same. 



Those from Vernon, a locality intermediate in its faunal characters 

 between those of Ashcroft and Field, are intcrgrades between artf- 

 misice, with its short tail and light fulvous colors, and arcfictis, with 

 longer tail and dark mouse-gray shades. It is reasonable to expect 

 that the vast boreal regions of interior N. America, bounded on the 

 east by Hudson Bay, on the west by the Cascade Mountains, and 

 south l)y the higher mountain ridges which invade the northern 

 border of the United States, is tenanted by no other race or species 

 of the S. ameri<:anus type than arcticus.

DESCRIPTIONS OF EIGHT NEW POCKET MICE (GENUS PEROGNATHUS). 

 BY DR. C. HART MERRIAM. 



Among the Pocket Mice belonging to the collection of the U. S. 

 Department of Agriculture, now numbering upwards of 1,400 speci- 

 mens, are several that have not been named. Through the courtesy 

 of the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture, Dr. Chas. W. Dabney, 

 Jr., I am enabled to publish the accompanying descriptions and 

 illustrations in advance of their publication by the Department. 



Respecting the eight forms here proposed, it may be stated that 

 P. baileyl is a type very different from any heretofore described. It 

 is a large animal with a peculiar skull, which suggests affinities with 

 P. paradoxus on one hand, and with P. fonnosKs on the other, 

 though much nearer the latter than the former. P. columhianua is 

 a peculiar local form of the oUvaceits group. P. nev(ide)isis, pana- 

 mintinus, and mexicanus are small forms with much swollen mastoids, 

 belonging to the fiavus-longimembris group. P. nehoni, stephensi, 

 and caneiicens belong to the peinclllatus group of the subgenus 

 Chijetodipiis. 



The large series of specimens from Mexico, in the Department 

 collection, carry the range of the genus southward over Souora in the 

 west, and in the east over the states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, 

 Tamaulipas, Durango, San Luis Potosi, Zacatecas, and the Valley 

 of Mexico.

characters. — Size small; mastoid l)ulla} large; color 

 fuliginous in winter pelage. 



Color. — Winter pelage : Upper parts fuliginous or 

 dusky ; under parts and feet white ; a rather large 

 patch behind each ear, and a broad lateral stripe 

 (reaching from side of face to hind legs) ochraceous; 

 tail indistinctly bicolor, pale dusky above, whitish be- 

 neath. Summer pelage: Upper parts ochraceous, ob- 

 scured by the profuse admixture of black-tipped hairs. 

 Cranial characters. — Skull as in P. fiavus, but

 skin). Average measurements of 14 specimens from type locality: 

 Total length, 178; tail vertebne, 101; hind foot, 23. 



General characters. — Size rather small; ears rather long; tail of 

 medium length and moderately crested on distal 

 half; pelage rather coarse, with a few slender 

 spines on the rump (the spines are absent in the 

 young and in certain conditions of the molt). 

 Apparently C. nelsoni is an offshoot from the 

 Intermedius-obseurus type, from which it differs 

 widely in external appearance and less markedly 

 ill cranial characters. 



Color. — Summer pelage coarse : Upper parts 



grizzled yellowish-brown from admixture of coarse 



buffy and black hairs. Winter pelage finer, and 



grayish black in color. Under parts and feet 



white; tail bicolor, white ])elow, brownish- dusky above, becoming 



blackish distally. 



Cranial characters. — Skull similar to that of inteniirdii's, but 

 somewhat larger; maxillary arms of zygomata more squarely spread- 

 ing; nasals decidedly larger and longer.

 Total length, 177; tail vertebra^ 95; hind foot, 21. 



General characters. — Size small; tail vertebne slightly longer than 

 head and body; tail scantily crested; ears medium; tragus higher 

 than l)road ; pelage rather soft ; no spines on rump or elsewhere. 

 This species is evidently a dwarf of the peincillatus 

 group, though the area it inhabits is completely 

 isolated from the range of the pen ieillatiis type. 



Color. — UpptM- parts huffy-drab varying to pale 

 drab-brown; a rather large pale ring around eye; 

 under ])arts, feet, and fore legs white; no lateral 

 line; tail bicolor, slightly darker than back above 

 and terminally, white beneath. 



Cranial charuefers. — Skull similar to that of /;/- 

 feriiiedias, but much smaller and flatter, with inter- 

 parietal broadly and Hatly pentagonal instead of 

 strap shaped, and audital l)ulla- more slender. In size and general 

 form the skull agrees most closely with arrii(iriii.'< from the middle 

 region of the Peninsula of Lower California. It differs from aren- 

 arlns in having the rostrum and nasals much broader and the 

 audital bulla- much less swollen.

the base of the pterygoid process. It forms a deep recess, the mouth 

 of which is directed outward, the bases of the pterygoid processes 

 are convex and opposed to one another on either side of the mesoptery- 

 goid fossa. The occipital condyles are without division : the appear- 

 ance is quite the same as in the Cetacea, and suggests a similar 

 mechanism of the atlauto-occipital joint, namely, a cranium which 

 is deviated scarcely at all from a horizontal plane. The anterior 

 annular ligament of the ankle-joint is ossihed, and constitutes 

 part of the tibia. The astragalus is nearly flat on proximal 

 surface, and the patellar trochlea is low and wide. These two 

 characters probably co-ordinate, and establish Blarina as an animal 

 whose posterior extremity is of low specialization, and one which sup- 

 ports the trunk imperfectly. The absence of the pubic symphysis 

 probably is associated with the above conditions. The biceps femoris 

 and gracilis constitute one muscle, and the two enclose the slender 

 semitendinosus in a manner suggestive of the tenuissimus of Lepus.

Walker's description. As both sexes were taken the same day 

 and at the same spot, alona- a path in the hills back of the town, 

 I have no doubt but that they are the same species, though the 

 female ditfers considerably from the male. The following is a de- 

 scription of the female, which has not been described: — 



Length 8 mm. Face and front yellowish ; vertex green ; oral 

 margins brownish; autennte reddish; aristae black. Thorax and 

 scutellum green ; a slender line of yellow extends from the humeri 

 to the base of the wings (also present in the male). Abdomen 

 much wider than in the male, bluish-green, second segment concave 

 at the sides, with a central yellow spot at the base; pubescence on the 

 posterior borders of the segments more prominent than in the male. 

 Venter bluish, the second segment, and the posterior margin of the 

 thii-d and fourth narrowly margined with yellow. Front and 

 middle legs yellow; posterior femora with outer half of the tibite 

 and tarsi brownish- black, base of the femora and V)as<il half of the 

 tibitie and tarsi yellow. In the color of the posterior legs occurs the 

 greatest difference, though the outer portions of the femora, tibiaj, 

 and tarsi of the male are noticeably darker.

Length ( ^ ) 2} mm. Face and vertical triangle black, shining. 

 Facial protuberance prominent, conical ; antenna yellow'. Facets 

 of the upper half of the eye double the size of those of the lower. 

 Thorax and scutellum greenish- black, shining; humeri, and a nar- 

 row line from there to the base of the wings, yellow. Abdomen 

 yellow, with a small black subtriangular spot in the center of the 

 fourth and fifth segments ; venter yellow. Legs yellow, posterior 

 femora and tibite with a wide medial band of dark brown. Wings 

 hyaline, whitish, discal cell emits four veins.

DESCRIPTIONS OF A NEW SUBGENUS AND NEW SPECIES OF ARVICO- 

 LINE RODENTS FROM BRITISH COLUMBIA AND WASHINGTON. 



BY SAMUEL N. RHOADS. 



Tetramerodon' snbgen. nov. 

 Type Arvicola ( Tetranierodoi) tefraiiierits Rhoads. sp. uov., Victoria, B. C. 



Suhgeneric characters. — Dentitiou as in the subgenus Mynomei? 

 Rafinesque' as restricted by Dr. Coues ( Mou. N. Amer. Rodentia, 

 1877, p. 153), but differing therefrom in the middle upper molar 

 lacking a postero-interual triauglar loop. This tooth is composed of 

 an anterior loop, a closed antero- exterior triangle, a closed median 

 inner triangle, and a postero-exterior triangle. Other characters 

 as in Mi/iiome.<. See, below, dentition of A. borealh, Fig. 1. 



This section of the genus Arvicola includes a larger number of 

 species than any other, whereas typical Mynomes is restricted to very 

 few. Among those which class under Tetramerodon may be men- 

 tioned A. xantJiogitathus, chrotorrhinus, horealu, lonf/icandiis, alticolus, 

 niogollonemis, niordax, )ianiis, macropiis, pauperrimus, towmendi, 

 tetramerus (1. c. ), edax, phceiis, and operarins. 



Of Mynomes we have A. penii-mlriniifii.-i, ferrtenovce, aztecus, and 

 drximmondii f 



Prof. Baird characterized the subgenus Henuotonujs ( = Myonomes 

 of Coues) as having the middle "upper molar with five closed tri- 

 angles, the last two sometimes subconfluent," taking no notice of 

 the species then known, as edax, townsendi, xanthognathus, and 

 borealis, in which, to a greater or less degree, the posterior triangle 

 shows no indication of the subdivision seen in A. pennsylvanieus. The 

 four-triangled species greatly outnumber those which possess five, 

 and it is fully in accord with the system that they should be either 

 separated subgenerically from Mynomes or that this subgenus be re- 

 characterized. 



' From 7t7;-rt/;/f;-«= four-parted, and Odoiis = tooth. 



- Dr. Coues' reiisous for chauging Raliuesque's original spelling to .lf]ononies 

 are insufficient. If retained at all, it must remain J/jnomcs. 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OK PHI I.ADKLPUIA. 283 



If the latter course be adopted, we still have an inexact diagnosis 

 to accommodate the three or four exceptional species which develop 

 the fifth triangle, and the name }fiiiinmt'!<, based by Kafinesque on a 

 five-triangled species, becomes inapplicable. On this account, it 

 seems to me quite consistent with the exact subdivision of the other 

 members of the genus Arrlcoh, as well as necessary, that tlie svdi- 

 genus Tefraiiierddou be adopted. 



Arvicola ' Tetramerodon i tetramerus sp. nov. Type Xo. 327. ad.. ^, Coll. of 

 S. N. Rhoiuls. Bea.oii Hill Park.Vi<ti)ri:i. Biitisli Cnluinhia. Mav 111, 1S93. 

 Coll. by S. N. R. 



Description. — Size medium, about the ?,'AmQ &% A. penm^ylmnicuA. 

 Tail rather long. Color above, grizzled blackish-brown, beneath 

 clear ash. Feet grayish-brown. Tail bicolor, matching corre- 

 sponding surfaces of body, well-haired and peuicillate. 



Dentition as in M(i)iome.-<, but lacking the posterior fifth section 

 of middle upjjer molar, typical of that subgenus. 



Measurements (of type). — Total length, 170 mm; tail vertebno, 

 50; hind foot, 23. Average of five adults — Total, 175; tail, 48; 

 foot, 22. Skull — Total length, 26-5; basilar length, 24; zygomatic 

 breadth, 15; length of nasals, 7*5; incisors to post- palatal notch, 

 14-2; interorbital constriction, 3-4; length of mandilde, U) ; wiiltli 

 of mandible. 8-5. 



Ten specimens of this species were taken in the suburbs of Vic- 

 toria, in the dry, grassy woods of Beacon Hill Park, overlooking the 

 Strait of Fuca. 



They most nearly resemble toii:n.<iniiii from I'uget Sound in essen- 

 tial characters. Compared with tinm.iendi the Victoria voles may 

 be readily distinguished by their much smaller size, blacker colora- 

 tion above, the greater relative width of the interorbital region, the 

 supraorbital ridges never meeting medially as in old toim.M'inli, anil 

 the posterior margins of the frontals being rounded and but slightly 

 encroaching upon the parietals. This species difiers essentially from 

 A. occidentalis and A. ctdijorniriix as defined by Baird in its lack of 

 red or yellow tints. From A. ini>ii/<iiii(.^ IVale (fide Haird i litininrnis 

 differs in the greater relative length belwi-en the upper molars and 

 incisors, also in tlie posterior iipptr molar having four outer, salient 

 angles instead of three, rioi'. Baird states there is a great similaril\ 

 between the colors of in<tidiiini!< and <diix and that the former is 

 grayer than tuiviDfendi. In tHramrni.'i the colors are much darker.

Evotomys pygmaeus sp. nov. Type No. 247, ad. 9 • ^'o^^- of S- N- Rhoads, 

 mouth of Xisqually River, Pierce Co., Washington, t'ol. by S. X. R. 



Descnption. — Size smallest of any described species of the genus. 

 Color above a rusty gray, lighter than (japperi, darkest along the 

 top of head and back; sides and belly muddy a?;h- gray. Margins 

 of ears and upper third of tail sooty. Feet light gray. Skull short 

 and wide, with relatively wide and flaring zygoma and brain case 

 and broad interorbital region. The audital bnlhe are very much in- 

 flated, spheroidal, separated medially by less than 1 mm. , their greatest 

 transverse diameter being only 1 ram. less than the longitudinal. 

 The dentition is intermediate between that of E. ofr-lfleiitalls and E. 

 califoniicw-i, Avith the anterior lower molar of californicus and the 

 posterior upper molar of occidentalis. In the latter case, however, 

 the two anterior lateral triangles are completely closed in pi/gnuen-t, 

 the second not connecting with the third as figured by Dr. ]Merriam^ 

 for occidentalis. The nasals do not reach the posterior points of the 

 premaxillaries by 1? mm. 



MeasuremenU. — Total length, 120 mm; tail vertebne, 34; hind 

 foot, 16. Skull — Total length, 21 ; basilar length, 18-4; zygomatic 

 width, 1 2 ; length of nasals, 6 ; incisors to post-palatal notch, 9 ; 

 interorbital constriction, 4*1 ; length of mandible, 12. 



The single specimen on which I have based the above diagnosis is 

 the only one of the genus secured by me in the Pacific coast district of 

 the northwest. It was captured under a log in the dense spruce 

 forest which covers the bluflf' overlooking Puget Sound, at the 

 mouth of the Nisqually River. It is fully adult, with well-worn 

 teeth. This species may be known externally from its nearest geo- 

 graphic congeners by its small size. In color it is much lighter than 

 occidentalis, and (from the description) even paler than californicus. 



Evotomys gapperi saturatus .subsp. nov. Type No. 483. ad. 9, Coll. of S. X. 

 Rbi.ads. Xelson. British Columbia, Aug. 17, 1892. Col. by S. N. E. 



Description. — Size and proportions of E. gapperi, but much 

 darker, the " red" of back being dark chestnut, the sides and belly 

 dark grayish- plumbeous XN-ithout ochraceous tints of gapperi. The 

 upper half of tail sooty black, strongly defined against gray of 

 lower half. Compared with that of gapperi, the .skull is relatively 

 narrower, the ntusals longer, the nasal premaxillary processes reach-

ing cousiderably behind base of" nasals; the auilital biilho are also 

 narrower, elongate, and depressed. 



The dentition does not ditier from that of (japperl, Ijut the other 

 characters of* the skull of type, as above defined, show such con- 

 siderable differences from gapperl of eastern Canada that the (jues- 

 tiou of itri specific value is yet an open one. 



Measnremoits. — Total length, 141 mm; tail vertebriu, 41 ; hind 

 foot, 19. Skull— Total length, 23-3; zygomatic width, 12-1 ; length 

 of nasals, 6*5 ; incisors to post-palatal notch, 10; interorbital con- 

 striction, 4-2; length of mandible, 13-2; width of mandible, t)-2. 



One female (the type) was trapped on the banks of a small 

 stream flowing into Kootenai Lake, in the town limits of Nelson, in 

 the Selkirk ^Mountains. Two others were taken in the Kocky Moun- 

 tains, at Field, on the banks of the Kicking Horse River. 



Erofo)iii/>< \^;/(tpperi'] d(:nv><oiii Merriam, the west Arctic representa- 

 tive, differs from safuratu/i in the opposite light i)hase of coloration, a 

 parallel case to that exhibited by the Hudsonian Chickadees, Punts 

 hndsonlcns, P. li. stoneijt, and P. h. (■ohnnhluiins.

Since the i)ul»lication of the Monograph of North American Ko- 

 dentia, this species has been classed, on the authority of Dr. Cones, 

 as a subspecies of Arvicola peiin.-<]ilmnicits. Several specimens from 

 the material examined by Dr. Cones in the preparation of his 

 monograph of the Arvicolina^ were subseijuently presented to the 

 Academy of Natural Sciences. Among them I find two skins with 

 skulLs and one specimen in alcohol enumerated in Dr. Cones' tabu- 

 lated list.s of Arctic Arvio^las, which, after a careful study of 

 Richardson's two dcscrijiticjiis of .1. hi)re(ili.'<, I am convinced should 

 be referred to that species. The characters exhibited by these s|)eci- 

 mens are those of an animal quite distinct from priniAiilvniiiciin and 

 justify restoring horcnlis to tlie full specific raidi origimdiy given it. 



Audubon and liachman (su|». cil.) have clearly restated tlu- ex- 

 ternal characters of this vole from a pcrsomil examination of Rich- 

 ardson's types. 



Its franial characters remain iiiidcfMUMl, and may l)e ilcscribed as

Skull. — Remarkably angular, 

 shallow and flattened, its anterior 

 j ugal breadth exceeding the squa- 

 mosal, much as in Synaptomys. 

 Posterior ends of frontals pro- 

 duced in a long, slender, strap- 

 shaped process, lieginning just be- 

 hind the interorbital constriction, 

 between the projecting anterior 

 corners of the squamosal bones 

 and terminating in a dove-tailed 

 process between the acutely point- 

 ed and extended anterior corners 

 of the parietals. Interorbital 

 constriction narrow, acutely com- 

 pressed, its single median ridge depressed below the frontal plane. 

 Audital bullie subtriangular, depressed, long and narrow. Denti- 

 tion as given (1. c. ) for the subgenus Tetramerodon, of which, with 

 A. xanthogiiathns and A. chyotorrhinus, it forms a typical represen- 

 tative in the lack of any attempt at a posterior inner fold, or angle, 

 in the middle upper molar. The anterior trefoil of the first lower 

 molar is less deeply indented than in any Arvicola I have examined. 

 The mandibles present no peculiar characters. An incipient groove 

 can be detected, almost evenly dividing the face of each upper in- 

 cisor. 



Arvicola drummondi Aud. and Bach. 



Five specimens of meadow mice, three taken on tlie shores of Lac La 

 Hache, B. C, and two from the valley of the Kicking Horse River, 

 at Field, B. C, I had previously desci'ibed in manuscript as new, 

 under the name Arvicola (Mynomes) microceplialax. 



The description of ^1. drummondi (And. and Bach., Quad. N. 

 Amer., 1854, 166) 1 have since found to correspond so closely in 

 every particular with the characters of these specimens, it seems far 

 preferable to make them the basis of a full restoration of drion-

moiidi to a place in nomenclature. It may be stated that Richard- 

 son's A. novehorafenifk (Raf. ), the name under which that autlior 

 described the type of drmnmondi was said by him to have come from 

 the dry uplands of the Rocky Mountains inhabited liy ^1. .rtnithof/- 

 nathus. This would indicate a locality far north of that from which 

 my specimens came, also a less aquatic environment, and a somewhat 

 diHerent faunal region. Audubon and Bacliman give, "Valleys of 

 the Rocky Mountains," as the habitat of dridirmoiuli. More com- 

 plete collections from the whole length of the internu-diatc country 

 may show that the Lac La Hache animal is separable from the 

 northern one ; in such an event the name mirrocephalm may still be 

 applicable to it.

Degrripfion. — Size considerably less than that of A. peiinsiilviin- 

 icus; ears moderate; tail short and scantily haired; skull small, 

 highly arched, compressed and elongate, the orbits miich narrowed 

 by the compression of the zygoma ; eyes very small, as in PIfiimys; 

 feet as originally described by Richardson. Teeth of typical Mt/iiomes, 

 the postero-internal section of middle upper molars as large as its 

 opposing outer triangle. Color above grizzled l)lack-l)rown, beneath 

 a clear hoary plumbeous, lacking the muddy wash mentioned by .And. 

 and Bach. Tail sooty above, grayer beneatii.

This species resembles A. ii<iiiii>i,' but its possession of a five 

 triangled middle upper molar distinguishes it from that species, 

 which, as Dr. Merriam expressly .<tates, has but four triangles. Tlie 

 two specimens from Field show no diderences from the one above

tains," and described minutely bv Richardson (Fau. Bor. Amer. , 

 1829, 120), under caption of "Arincola rlparias (Ord?)," is almost 

 certainly a member of the genus Aulacom(/s.'^ A comparison of the 

 description of this animal given by Richardson and that given by 

 Audubon and Bachman,' when they renamed it A. richardsoni, with 

 my type of Aiilacomys arvicoloidef, leaves very little room for doubt 

 that the two are generically the same. Their specific diHerences con- 

 sist in the much longer tail of arvicoloides, its tail also being black 

 above and nearly unicolor, its feet black, and the mouth and chops 

 grayish- brown, like the surrounding parts. 



An examination of Richardson's introductory notice of Mr. 

 Drumraond's travels, coupled with the statement that the specimen 

 was taken in summer, fix the type locality of A. richardsoni within, 

 say, fifty miles of Athabasca Pass in the Rocky Mountains, among 

 the foothills traversed by the Columbia Portage trail connecting the 

 head waters of the Athabasca, Saskatchewan, and C'olum])ia Rivers, 

 in latitude 53°. A. arvicoloides was taken somewhat east of the 

 dividing ridge of the Cascade Mountains in latitude 47°. Should 

 the correctness of this interpretation be proved, Drummond's speci- 

 men should stand as Aulacomys richardsoni (Dekay).*

 tions to the adjoining genera. 



The specimens differed in some respects from the original speci- 

 mens from which the diagnostic (le.scription had been drawn, making 

 it advisarl)le to supplement that descri})tion. 



The new specimens were a part of some recent gatherings made 

 by Mr. Lancaster Thomas at the original locality for the species at 

 Craid)erry, N. C. , in duly and August of this year. 



The sporangia of the tvpe specimens were fretpienlly gioupeil in 

 clusters, but with rare exceptions they grew upon separate sti|ies. 

 20 




290 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



In the receut gatheriugs, however, the sporangia show a remarkable 

 tendency to aggregation into clumps of from twelve to twenty, the 

 stipes growing together to form a thick compound stipe surmounted 

 by the densely clustered sporangia. In some cases these are dis- 

 torted by crowding, having their adjoining walls grown together, 

 constituting stipitate tethalia. 



The clustered sporangia have usually a purplish metallic lustre 

 rather than the silver or bronze lustre of the single forms. 



The capillitium differs from the type only in the presence of an 

 extraordiuarv number of small dark-violet colored bulbous thicken- 

 ings occurring upon the threads in their course, similar to those found 

 in the capillitium of certain species of Didijmium and Choudrio- 

 derma. These thickenings are ellipsoidal, turbinate or conical in 

 shape and occur more frequently near the ends of the threads. 



The speaker thought that these peculiar thickenings were of 

 special interest on account of their bearing upon the relative position 

 of the genus Diachca in the systematic classification of the Myxo- 

 mycetes. As they are almost exclusively found in certain species of 

 the Didvmiaceie and the single species of the genus Spumaria, this 

 species at least, of the genus D'lachrca would seem to be connected 

 with the Calcareie by good structural characters other than the mere 

 existence of granules of lime in the stipes and columellas of the 

 sporangia. 



The bulbous thickenings were also found in the ca})illitiuni of the 

 type specimens but not conspicuously, or to a greater extent than 

 thev are sometimes found in the other species of Dlacluci. 



The speaker concluded that the genus Diachrca was ])roperly as- 

 sociated with the Order Didymiacefe (including the s[euu> Spiim aria) 

 notwithstanding its points of resemblance to the genus Lamproderma 

 suggesting its possibly closer relationship to the Order Stemonitaceic. 



The differences between the present gatheriugs and the former ones 

 were probablv due to climatic causes, the excessive rainfall and great 

 atmospheric humidity prevailing in the North Carolina mountains 

 during Julv and the early part of August of the present year, caus- 

 ing an exul)erant development of plasmodium which resulted in a 

 growth of unusually aggregated and tethalioid forms

A PROPOSED CLASSIFICATION OF THE FOSSORIAL HYMENOPTERA OF 

 NORTH AMERICA. 



BY WILLIAM J. FOX. 



The arrangement of our Fossores contained in tlie following pages, 

 I trust will be of some service to students of these insects. It has 

 been evident for some time that the existing arrangement, that con- 

 tained in Cresson's Synopsis,^ is of little value, as it is too superficial. 

 Entirely too many families, without characters to substantiate them, 

 were recognized : the Sphegidiu, for instance, which were divided into 

 no less than nine families. Accepting these nine families would, it 

 seems to me, necessitate the erection of families for such genera as 

 Neolarra, Botlujnostethus, Tnipoxylon and others, which stand more 

 or less isolated and yet possess characters which connect them in one 

 way or another with the formerly existing families and would form 

 more distinct families, were they so recognized, than, say, the JMel- 

 linidse, Ampulicidre, Nyssonidte or Bembicidte. How these nine 

 supposed ftimilies have been disposed of, the following pages will 

 show. 



Saussure's recent classification- is not satisfactory, inasmuch as it 

 is incomplete, and, moreover, his conclusions, particularly regarding 

 the Pompilidic, are not vrell founded, fie makes two tribes of this 

 family, the Pompiliens and Pepsiens, separating them on a very 

 trivial character — the position of insertion of the first recurrent 

 nervure in the second submarginal cell, a character which, in my ex- 

 perience, has always proved variable. Under the first mentioned 

 tribe he includes Ceropales, which he seems to consider as not worthy 

 of more than generic rank, while he forms a tribe for the reception 

 of Peps f.?, which should be placed with the Pompiliens, if anywhere. 

 The ^lutillidje and Sapygidsc are considered as subfamilies of the 

 Scoliidee; these are ranked as families in this paper. The old 

 families Pemphredonidie and Crabroni(l;e au<l O.rnheJu.^ he considers 

 as tribes of equal value to the Ny.ssonidie, Benibicid;o and Larrida\

 authors.

all of which are ranked as tribes of the Sphegicho. The two families 

 mentioned and Oxi/bclKs are treated as subfamilies in this paper as 

 they are more distinct than are the numerous tribes of the Bembi- 

 ciuit and Spheginte. 



It is hoped that the paper niay at least call forth improvements 

 on the classification suggested. 



MUTILLIDiE. 



I regard this as a well-defined family, disagreeing witli some 

 authors who jdace it as a subfamily of the Scoliidie. The wingless 

 females are, in my o{)inion, suthcient to separate these insects from 

 the ScoliidiX'. In the latter family the intermediate cox;v are widelv 

 separated, while in the ^lutillida' they are not sci)arated by a dis- 

 tance equalling their width. In the generic table below, Photopsis 

 Blake is considered as synonymous with SphcernpJifhalwa Bhike, as a 

 comparison of the two genera fails to show umj ditlerential charac- 

 ters. The family can be separated into two tril)es as follows: — 



Females (as far as known) without oct-lli; marginal cell of (^) wings 

 more or less short, not reaching by any means the apex of 

 wing ; some of the nervures generally obsolete, particularly 

 those forming the third discoidal cell MUTILLINI. 



Females with ocelli; marginal cell of (^) wings long and pointed, 

 reacliing almost the apex of wings ; all the nervures distinct, 

 never obsolete MYKMOSINl. 



Tribe I.— MUTILLINI. 



Contains the genera PsaiDhiotheniia,^ Mutilla, Sphaerophthahna 

 ( = Photopsis in lit), Bmchycistis nud Chyphotes, and is defined as 

 above. The genera may be tabulated as follows: — 



1 — Antennae simple in botli sexes - 



Antenme of male flabellate 1'sammotiikhma Latr. 



L'— Ej-es ovate, emarginate within the <?, entire in 9; thorax of 

 9 generally oblong in shape, truncate behind. M('iiLii.\ Linnr". 

 Eyes round, entire; thorax generally ovate, rounded pos- 

 teriorly '5 



8— Intermediate tibia' Willi two apical spurs 4 



Intermediate tibiie with but one ajtical Hj)ur: wing sligma very 

 large; body smooth, glabrous; marginal cell usually shorter 

 than stigma; antenna- longer than head and thorax

Tribe 11.— MYmiOSIXI. 



Proposed for the genera Mijnuom and Methocd, and i* character- 

 ized chiefly by the females possessing distinct ocelli. IJut few 

 species have l)een described from America. 



Apex of abdomen (^), unarmed; wings with three submargiual 

 cells; ^ cubital nervure of hind wings received by the submedian 

 cell at apex; thorax (9) ccmiposed apparently of two parts; 

 bodj' rugose ( 9 ) ^Iykmosa Latr. 



Apex of al)domeu ( $ ) armed with a curved spine; two submargi- 

 ual cells; cubital nervure of hind wings received considerably 

 before the apex of submedian cell; thorax (9) divided into 

 tliree parts; body smootli, shining and very ant-like. 

 Mi-rrjiocA Latr. 



If the genus Thyn)im occurs in America as reported by Patton 

 (Ent. News, III, 104) another tribe will have to be added to this 

 family. I doubt, however, the existence of American representa- 

 tives. 



SCOLIIDJE. 



This f\\mily is sufficiently characterized by both sexes being- 

 winged to separate it from the ^[utillidcO. The North American 

 representatives comprise three tribes,*' as follows: — 

 Eyes emarginate; spur of fore til)ia> large, strongly curved, dilated, 

 and truncate at end; intermediate tibi;e with one spur; abdomen 



of $ armed with three spines at apex SC0LII2s J. 



Eyes entire ; spur of fore tarsi not much curved or dilated, either 

 pointed or bifurcate at end ; intermediate til)i;L' with one or two 

 spurs; abdomen of $ with but one spine at apex. 

 Hexes similar in form; marginal cell broadened toward the 

 base (in our genera, the 9 '« have the marginal cell open at apex) ; 

 antenme sliort in both sexes TVPHIINI. 



* This may ultimately prove but a division or subgenus of Mutilla. 



* There are really four siilmiargiuals, as the cnhital iicrviire extend:; out to 

 the apex of wing.

slender, as long or longer than head and thorax 



MYZ[^'IN1 (/Y£*7/i'^.s- .Sauss.) 



Tribe I.— SCOLIIXl. 

 Two genera occur in our fauna, as follows: — 



Anterior wings with only one recurrent nervure .... Scoi.ia Fabr. 

 Anterior wings with two recurrent nervures FZr.i.s Fabr. 



Each of these genera may ])e divided into subgenera by the num- 

 ber of submarginal cells. In the subgenus TrlscoUa there are three 

 cells, while in DUcolia there are two. In TrleU.-< three, in Dld'u two. 



Tribe 11.— TIPHIINI. 



The lirst and second submarginal cells merged into one tlirough the 

 disappearance of the lirst trausverso-cubital. nervure ; base of 

 lirst abdominal segment produced angularly or dentate on each 

 side; intermediate tibiie with one s[)ur Tiphia Fabr. 



Three submarginal cells, the first trausverso-cubital nervure present, 

 but abbreviated, not reaching the cubital nervure; ba.se of first 

 abdominal segment not produced or dentate at base ; inter- 

 mediate tibiic with two spurs 



Epomidiopterox Sichel (= y^ovr//yi/nV<). 



Tribe III.— MYZININI. 



This tribe is identical with Saussure's "Section des I'lesiites." 

 Plesla seems to be synonymous with Miizine Latr. The latter has 

 priority, being described two years in advance of Plesla. But one 

 genus, Mi/zlne, is found in America, which may be distinguished by the 

 tribal characters given above. 



SAPYGIDJE. 

 Intermediate coxa? contiguous ; legs, except til^al s[)urs, unarmed ; 

 no pygidial area; apex of (S) abdomen without spines. These 

 characters seem sufficient to keep these insects distinct from the 

 preceding familv, to which they have been assigned by some authors, 

 and, moreover, the lirst and second ventral segments are contiguous, 

 while in the Scoliida' they arc widely separated. Supij(j<i, our only 

 genus, has the eyes emarginate within, the intermediate tibiie with 

 two spurs. For several species having the vertex tuberculate, the 




296 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OK [1894. 



name Easapyfja has been proposed by Cresson, but these form only 

 a subgenus at tlie most. 



POMPILID^. 



This is a distinct family characterized by the very long posterior 

 legs, long antenns^e, and by the first and second ventral segments 

 being not widely separated. The species possess no pygidium. I 

 would separate the family into three tribes, placing the Ceropalini 

 first, as I consider the genus Ct^ropale.< as ])eing closest to the Sapy- 

 gidse. 



Sting sheath of 9 piojectiug, ])roniinent ; eyes slightly eiuarginate 

 within, near the toii ; labruni large, projecting ; antennae never 



curled after death, situated w ell above the clypeus 



' ("EROPALINI. 



Sting sheath of 9 uot projecting ; eyes entiic. 



First discoidal cell not longer than first subniargiual ; subniediau 

 cell of anterior w ings longer than the median on the exteruo- 

 raedian uervure ; second discoidal cell not half the size of the 

 third; labruni exserted, longer than the clypeus; abdomen com- 

 pressed apically '. . XOTOCYPHIXI. 



First discoidal cell longer than lirst subjuargiual ; labruni not 

 exserted ; length of median cell of anterior wings variable: 

 second discoidal cell at least half the size of the third; abdomen 

 rarely compressed POMPILIXI. 



Tribe I.— CEROPALINI. 



This tribe contains but a single genus, Ceropales, having the char- 

 acters given above. The species are always more or less ornamented 

 with yellow, some being extremely handsome. 



Tribe II.— XOTOC YPHIX 1 . 



The genus Xotoci/phus constitutes this tribe, which differs chiefly 

 from the Ceropalini by the non-exserted sting sheath. 



Tribe III.— P():SIPILIX1. 



The Pomjiiliui contains the typical forms of the family and is, by 

 far, the largest tribe. Prpsis, which Saussure considers as a tribe, 

 should, in my opinion, be placed in the tribe Pompilini, as its charac- 

 ters will not warrant a tribal distinction. Pitrapoinpilus Cress, (non 

 Sm.), Plankepis Latr., and Aporns Spin., seem to be merely groups 

 of the genus Pompilus, as has been pointed out by Kohl. ' Epipom-

SPHEGID^. 



I would divide this vast family into five subfamilies as follows: 

 Spheginie, Pemphredoninic, Bembicime, Oxybelina', and C'ral)- 

 ronimc. I have thought it best to unite under one head the Lar- 

 ridie, Berabicida?, Nysouidaj, Mellinidse, and Philanthidie, as it is 

 impossible to find characters by wliich these families (so-called) can 

 be limited, even as subfamilies. The reader is referred to Hand- 

 lirsch's paper on Nysson and Bemhex.^^ It may seem out of place 

 to put the Pemphredonime close to the Spheginse ; yet I feel justified 

 in doing so on account of the abdominal petiole which is peculiar to 

 both subfamilies. 



Abdomen connected with the thorax by a slender ijedieel of variable 

 length, and never sessile with the following segment. 

 Intermediate tibiie with two apical spurs; claws nearlj' always 



more or less dentate within SPHEGIN/E. 



Intermediate tibi;e witli but one apical spur; claws never dentate 



within PEMPHREDONIN.E. 



Abdomen never connected with the thorax by a slender i)edicel, at

 More than one submarginal cell, if not, then the eyes are einar- 

 ginate within; neuration of posterior wings complete.

Only one submarginal and two discoidal cells (eyes entire). 



Metathorax with a long projection'-' at base; postscutellum with

Trilie I.— SPHEGINI. 



Three genera belong to this tril)e. They have numerous sub- 

 genera or groups of species which at one time were regarded as 

 genera. Kohl's admirable paper, Die Hymenopterengruppe der 

 Spheciden, '■' will be of much value to the student of this group. 



Our genera may be separated in the following manner; — 



Second submargiual cell receiving but one recurrent nervure; 9 

 with or without tarsal comb Si'MKX Linn6. 



Second submarginal cell receiving both nervures.

The genus Anipulex is represented in Xorth Amei'ica by the sub- 

 genus IihlnopsU Westw. It is distinguished l^y the rostrate elypeus 

 aud by having two submarginal cells. The prothorax is long as in 

 TrifjonopHs; the metathorax is many ridged and has very strong 

 transverse striie above and possesses two strong teeth. The first 

 submarginal cell is twice the length of the second. Marginal cell 

 with an appendiculation at apex. 



Subfamily PEMPHREDONIN^. 



The ]Miniesidie are here considered as representing a tribe of this 

 subfamily, and Mbne.ia Shuck, as a synonym of Psen Latr. It is 

 impossible to separate these two genera as their characters vary, 

 particularly the ueuratiou. It is true that the inner spur of hind 

 tibire of Mimesa is peculiarly shaped, but this development will be 

 found in Pse)i, although in a lesser degree.

 guished by the characters given in the above table. The Psenini

Subfamily BEMBICINiE. 



Under this head I unite the Larridjo, Bembicidie, Nyssouidic, 

 Philanthidte, and Mellinida'. The characters of those supposed 

 families are not sufficient or constant enough to sustain them in 

 such a rank, and are valueless in some cases, even as characters of 

 minor importance. As in the case of the Bembicida', it is easy 

 to take such types, as Bemhe.v, Jfonednld, forms with rostrate 

 clypeus, and separate them into a family, apparently distinct fi'om 

 the Xyssonidic and Larrida', if these genera are compared, say, 

 with Lio-ra and Xifuson; but certain genera will be encountered, 

 Neolarra and Bothynostethus for instance, whose proper position will 

 remain undetermined. Xcolarra combines both Larrid, Bembicid 

 and Nj^s-sonid characters, yet it will fit in neither of the families de- 

 fined. Bothynostethus inclines to both the Larrid;c and Nyssonida\ 

 and seems to be a connecting link between thorn. Sllziis and Sphr- 

 '•/((>•, although placed in the Jiembicida-, possesses the neuration and 

 non-rostrate labrum, characters which bind them to the Nyssonidio. 

 It must not be forgotten that the labrum of the Nyssonidio is i)romi- 

 nent, indeed in Goryfcs very prominent. Thirteen tribes of this 

 .subfamily seem to be indictate<l, which nund)cr will imdoubtedly 

 have to be reduced in the future.

Tribe VIII.— AST ATINI. 



This tribe is formed of the genus A.itatii.", and is based chiefly on 

 the strange disposition of the eyes of the male sex ; they meet on 

 the vertex, a characteristic not found in any other genus of the 

 fossorial Hymenoptera, and not, as far as 1 know, in any genus of 

 the Order. 



Tribe IX.— DIPLOPLECTRINI. 



The genus Diplopledron forms this tribe. The chief characters 

 are that botli sexes have the middle tibiic two spurred, the very 

 short subniarginal cell and the prominent and very long prothorax. 

 It is evidently allied to the European genus Dinetut<, which probably 

 belongs to this tribe. As the latter is the older genus, the name 

 proposed for this tribe will have to give way to Dincthd, but as 

 Dhietus does not occur in North America, and as this is simply a 

 classification of the forms inhabiting that region, I prefer to use the 

 name propo.^cd above. 



Tribe X.— M ISCOPH I N I.

 received by the second submarginal cell; marginal cell elongate, 

 truncate at apex and appendicnlate; eyes strongly converging 

 towards vertex Nitki-iopsis Saund. 



Tribe X l.-L^' H< )I)I M . 

 Li/rotla, upon which this tribe is based, might be placeil in the 

 Larrini, were it not for the regularly forme<l and distinct ocelli. 

 The only other character worth mentioning in which it difters from 

 the following tribe, is the peculiar shape of the prothorax above, 

 which is being apparently twice emarginate, with the intervening 

 space strongly develo})ed.

RECENT MOUND EXPLORATION IN OHIO. 

 BY GERARD FOWKE AND W. K. MOOREHEAD. 



During the past summer (1894) a number of mounds have been 

 explored in Ohio in behalf of the Academy of Natural Sciences 

 of Philadelphia. The reports of IMr. Gerard Fowke relating to the 

 Van ]\Ieter mound and of Mr. Warren K. Moorehead as to the 

 ]\Ietzger mound are appended. Clarence B. Moore. 



"Mounds in Pike County, Ohio. — Three miles south of 

 Piketon, half a mile from the point where Beaver Creek discharges 

 into the Scioto river, on the farm of J. M. Van Meter, ^ is a 'double 

 mound ' on the highest terrace. The larger part, measuring, after 

 being plowed over for a number of years, 75 feet in diameter and 

 10 feet high, has its west base just at the brink of the terrace at a 

 point where the bluff is 50 feet high, quite steep, ^\^th the creek at 

 its foot. The smaller, south of east from the first, is six and one-half 

 feet above the surrounding level and 56 feet in diameter. At the 

 junction of the two, the topis three and one-half feet above the general 

 level. 



"A trench 10 feet wide was started in the east side of the smaller 

 mound, gradually widening until it was 25 feet at the center, and 

 then drawing in until it was 20 feet wide at 15 feet west of the 

 center. Beneath the middle part was a core 20 feet across and 3 

 feet high of soil placed and packed, or much tramped, while wet ; 

 it was somewhat darker than the loam composing the remainder of 

 the mound, quite hard, and broke off in clods. 



"On the original surface of the ground, beginning about five feet 

 east of the center, was a burned place a little over 20 feet across at 

 the widest part, and reaching 20 feet west of the center, or nearly to 

 the lowest point between the mounds. A fire had been burned over 

 this area for a short time only and with a small amount of wood, as 

 the burned earth was nowhere more than an inch thick, most of it 

 much less, while the charcoal and ashes varied from a mere streak

to a little more than an inch except in one place where a short log 

 six inches in diameter was converted into charcoal. 



"Except an arrow and a spear, found loose in the dirt, there was 

 not a relic of any description, nor the smallest fragment of a human 

 bone. A few pieces of much hiii-iied hones of small animals or large 

 birds were in the chai'coal at the center, and many small pieces of 

 burned stone were scattered all through tlie mound. The eastern

"In the larger mound a circle forty feet in diameter was laid oil 

 with the apex as the centei-. This brought the circumference about 

 four feet below the top. 



"In the cap, 12 feet east of center were decayed human bones 

 witii a few rough beads and fragments of pottery; at the same dis- 

 tance southwest of center were others with a spear or knife liy one 

 femur and a Hint chisel, polished at the sharp end, near the skull. 

 None of the bones were entire, and being so close to the surface were

as soft as ashes. Six feet .southeast of center a flint knife lay near 

 fragments of a skull; and at the place where the chest l)ones would 

 have been were fragments of a pot tliat seemed to have l)een entire 

 when deposited. Less than a foot from the apex were fragmentary 

 human hones. 



"A knife and a boat-shaped slate ornament with a crease around 

 the middle were loose in the dirt. Nothing further was found in the 

 upper portion, A well wrought flint spear, 8.^. inches long, and a 

 hematite hemisphere were found on the top of this mound some years 

 ago — perhaps plowed out. All the loose earth was now scraped 

 away and concentric circles, five feet apart, laid off on the level sur- 

 face of the top. In the outer ring, on the northern and western sides, 

 within a foot or less of the top were traces of six skeletons, intrusive 

 burials ; nothing was found with any of them. 



"A little west of south from center, with its inner margin 17 feet 

 from that point, was an elliptical grave, dug before the mound was 

 begun. It measured a little more than nine feet long and a 

 little more than five feet wide, with the longer axis very nearly 

 east and west. At about 18 inches below the original surface, 

 along the center line of the grave, a body had been placed. 

 Only fragments of the teeth and skull remained, except that a 

 few small pieces of the pelvis and finger bones were preserved 

 b\' the action of five small rectangular copper plates" that had 

 evidently been fastened around the wrist. These plates were in a 

 little mass of verv loose, dark earth, probably remains of some soi't 

 of fur or fabric, stained in a few places with red ochre. Nothing 

 else was found in the gi-ave until at the bottom, more than a foot 

 below the upper level of the gray sand, which here lies four feet 

 under the proper surface. At this level lay a few decayed pieces of 

 bones of a medium sized person extended on the back, head east, 

 exactly under the upper skeleton. The l)ody had been covered with 

 bark or wood which extended to the margin of the grave on every 

 side and gave a reddish- l)rown tinge to the lower two inches of filled- 

 in earth. This earth was from a swam|) or low bottom, being black 

 and sticky and evidently packed in wet, causing the entire decay of 

 the skeleton which would otherwise have been well j)reserved by the 

 dry sand in which it lay. The grave wall was cut down straight for

two feel: l)elo\v this the ends drew in somewliat, while tlie sides were 

 slightly overhanging, inohiibly from caving in of the gravel while it 

 was being dug. The work was done fron\ the south side, as most of 

 the earth was thrown to that side, the remainder being piled at the 

 two ends. 



"At 15 feet north of the center began a streak of burned earth, 

 charcoal, and ashes, which gradually thickened toward the center. 

 It proved to be nearly circular in outline and 20 feet across. For 

 three or four feet around the margin the ashes seem to have been 

 swept toward the center, as the natural earth of the mound hail been 

 deposited directly on that burned, without any ashes or charcoal in- 

 tervening. At eight feet north of center the mass thickened to a 

 foot and held this thickness for six feet farther, and for nearly eight 

 feet east and west. The material forming the charcoal varied from 

 sedge grass to small trees, the largest piece being a pine log a foot 

 in diameter and six feet long. The inner })ortion of this was in its 

 natural condition, the charred outside having preserved the part 

 to which the tire had not reached. Much of the charcoal was from 

 wood burned while green and was bright as i)olished metal where it 

 had been kept tolerably dry. There were a few fragments of animal' 

 bone here and there, and enough small pieces of human bone to show 

 that a body or skeleton had been cremated, some of them being like 

 cinder, others scarcely charred. The thinness of the ashes and the 

 amount of the charcoal showed that the fire had been smothered 

 while much of the fuel remained on it. Lying on the top of the 

 charcoal where it was thickest was a considerable quantity of char- 

 red cloth, showing at least four distinct methods of weaving; there 

 was also nuich of what seemed to be fur or some such material ; the 

 latter was soft as soot, while some of the cloth was fairl}- well pre- 

 served, a very little of it showing scarcely any mark of burning. 



''Except as noted above, no relics of any description were found 

 anywhere in the lower part of the mound.

The five rectangular sheets of copper found with human remains 

 by Mr. Gerard Fowke, beneath the base of the larger Van .Meter 

 mound, near Piketou, Pike Co., Ohio, consisted of sheet copper oxi- 

 dized and cari)onate<l to a certain extent, though a large percentage ol" 

 metal was unaifected. These sheets, though not exactly similar as to

length and breadtli. do not vary materially, so that the measurement 

 of one, namely 2-5 inches by o-2 inches, may be considered to apply 

 approximately to all. That they had been portions of a sheet or 

 sheets of larger size was evidenced by at least one clo.sely ground 

 edge on each specimen, contrasting markedly with the rough line of 

 separation of the other margins. No ornamentation like the beaded 

 margin and the repousse work of Florida and Tennessee was 

 apparent, though the marks of numerous blows from a convex blunt 

 cutting- edge were visible on all the specimens. Exfoliation was 

 noticeable near tlie edges. The sheets were of irregular thickness 

 averaging about 1 mm. 



Notwithstanding these indices of aboriginal origin, so solid was 

 the appearance of the copper that, though no believer in a post- 

 Columbian origin for mounds as a rule, 1 admit having experienced 

 a feeling of doubt as to the origin of this copper, a doubt which a 

 thorough and careful anal3'sis, made by Ledoux and Company, of 

 New York, speedily dispelled. The result is given in detail: — 



"Copper 99-9180 



Silver 0-0198 



Arsenic 0-002G 



Antimony Trace 



Iron 0-0233 



Nickel and cobalt .... 0-OOHO 



"Notk: — The above analysis was made after removing the super- 

 imposed film of oxides and carbonate from the sample. Special ex- 

 amination for lead, bismuth, and zinc shows that none of these is 

 present." 



It is quite evident that here we have to do with native copper of a 

 purity greater than is ordinarily produced at the present time by any 

 smelting process^ and consequently of a still higher degree of purity 

 than would be the product of early processes of smelting the arsenical 

 sulphide ores of Europe*. Moreover, the introduction of lead in 

 refining, though not an invariable custom, was extensively practised 

 in P^ujope, especially in copjK'r intended for sheet or wire, and it.-i 



» All smelted copper coutains from three to ten huiulredthsof one per cent, 

 of combined oxygen.

 arsenic, or antimony, or botli, may always be regarded as good 

 evidence against an early European origin.

"The Metzger Mound. — This structure, the property of Mr. 

 Charles Metzger, is located on Deer Creek, about two miles from 

 Yellow Bud (southwest). Situated upon a hill one hundred and 

 fifty or one hundred and sixty feet iu altitude, the mound commands 

 a fine view of the surrounding country. The plains stretch away 

 towards the Scioto three miles distant and continue two miles east 

 of the river, where they terminate in high hills. The mound is very- 

 nearly round, and is thirty-four feet in height by two hundred feet 

 in diameter at the base. Alongside of it is a horse-shoe or crescent- 

 shaped embankment and two small mounds. 



"On August 20, 1894, work was begun upon the structure. 

 The mound had been originally opened by some farmers. When 

 they began work the structure stood forty feet in height. They sank 

 a circular shaft eight feet iu diameter from the apex downwards. 



"Our men first reduced the height of the mound about ten feet. 

 This gave a platform fifty feet iu diameter and twenty-four feet 

 above the surrounding sui-face. The ground in the center of the 

 structure (where the previous excavation had been sunk), we found 

 to be very damp and heavy, and as we proceeded downward, we be- 

 came convinced that the log pen found b}' the original excavators in 

 the center of the structure would be in a bad condition, and that we 

 must depend on other pens were we to take out any logs entire. 



"The structui'e was composed of ordinary hill clay. At the top it 

 was not stratified, and as it varied but slightly in color, it was 

 extremely difficult to distinguish any of the ' dumps. ''^ On August 

 22nd a very fragmentary skeleton was found about twelve feet below 

 the top and four feet southwest of the central excavation. The body 

 had been originally buried in bark which percolation of water from 

 above had utterly decomposed. With the bones was a spool-shaped 

 button of copper, about an incli in diameter, heavily coated with 

 copper oxide. 



"The 25th two teams were put upon the mound, and they, together 

 with the shovels, reduced it rapidly. When within four feet of the

top of the log pens we dispensed with the teams and used tlie shovel- 

 lers for the remainder of the work. One or two arrow-heads were 

 found durinu- the course of the excavations. 



" At eighteen feet from the top and eight feet north of the center 

 was a fairlv well preserved skeleton surrounded by pieces of saj)- 

 lings and logs, two to four feet in length. These were originally 

 laid, one al)ove the other, to the height of about a foot. These 

 logs, being of small size, when decayed, had broken beneath the 

 weight of earth. The bones of the skeleton were unusually yellow. 

 No relics were found with the remains. We saved some samples of 

 the wood, which experienced timber men pronounced oak and walnut. 



"On the 27th and 2<^th numerous bunches of tine roots and under- 

 ground moss were encountered. Samples of the moss were preserved. 

 There were also several deposits of boulders, made without apjiarent 

 reason. The mound, at this point (twenty-three feet from the top, 

 nine feet from the bottom), appeared to be stratified, and the earth 

 was very soft in places. 



"The log pen in the center of the mound, and the one northwest of 

 it, remained for mauv \ears before thev caved in. That is, the 



Metzser Muund. diaiiraiii showing Imiuled structure of portion of east wall of

Wood did not decav for a long })eriod of time. In the case of the 

 first or largest pen (central one) the earth was kept out of a space 

 12x15x4 feet. The second pen occupied a space about 8x10 and 

 about feet high, and was constructed <liflerently from the first, 

 being very small at the to]). These pens existed long enough for 

 the earth above them to be })acked into large clods, which did not 

 fall into the cavity when the wood decayed but gradually settletl, 

 Ibrming an arch. The second arch was about <S feet in diameter at 

 the bottom and 7 feet high. The cavity was filled with underground 

 moss. There was no evidence that moisture had ever entered the 




lie.

little cave. It Avas perfectly dry with fine dust in the bottom. The 

 moss would blaze when touched with a match. In the central pen 

 the conditions were entirely different. The excavation sunk by the 

 farmer? permitted water to penetrate entirely over 15x20 feet of the 

 base of the mound. 



" As the main trench was continued we noticed several small ash 

 pits and patches of dark and also burnt earth. In these were ashes, 

 pottery fragments, animal bones, mussel shells and tliiit chips. This 

 village site refuse was not considerable. 



" Below the upper portion diflereut colors in the mound showed 

 plainly the 'dumps' which contained from a peck to a third of a 

 bushel each. They clearly showed the mound to have been con- 

 structed entirely by manual labor, and that about as much earth as 

 could be conveniently carried by one person w^as deposited in each 

 load. The drawing B shows the section, three by six feet, which 

 has been carefully ' scalped' and smoothed to bring out the shades. 



" The trench at this [)oint was about forty-five or fifty feet in width 

 and was level throughout. The last three or four feet taken out by 

 the teams were removed from the center, and when the shovellers 

 began, the trench dipped from either end to the center. In working 

 to the original base line a large bed of ashes was uncovered. The 

 log pen itself extended 12 feet east and west to 15 feet north and 

 south. The statement of the original excavators we can hardly 

 verify. It appears that the pen was composed of smaller logs than 

 they state. Two large logs have left a broad, thick strip of decayed 

 wood on the narrowe.st side of the pen. One corner of the pen ran 

 over into the ash pit. The logs at the southeast corner seem to have 

 been somewhat larger than the others, and were badly decayed, but 

 we managed to dig around them and bring them into relief. Drawing 

 C shows the pen as far as we were able to trace it. 



"There were here and there fragments of red pottery. About one 

 foot below the remains of the logs were original yellow clay and 

 shale clay the natural hill soil. The decayed logs and the reddish 

 earth resulting from their decay would fill four or five barrels. 

 This will give an idea of the l)ulk which they originally represented. 

 It was our opinion from the excavation that most of the logs were 

 saplings, and that the pen was not as large as claimed by the origi- 

 nal explorers. While as large north and east it certainly was not 

 more than four feet hijrh.

The trench was cleaned to the original surface and experimental 

 holes were sunk even to the shale. There were iso burials helow the 

 original surface. 



"The ground had been levelled and burnt, llius giving the mound 

 an even floor or base. In nearly all mounds of the lower Scioto 

 this peculiarity of coustrnction is observed. It is, therefore, very 

 easy to keep u])on the base line. 



"A bed of ashes was discovered about four feet from the bottom on 

 the northwest side of the trench. In it were bits of charcoal of ex- 

 ceedingly bright lustre and as hard as bituminous coal. The ash 

 bed was everywhere covered with a thin layer of reddish bark. It 

 was impossible to preserve the bark in sections larger than two by 

 three inches. The earth below the ashes was burnt a bright brick 

 red. The ashes varied from three inches in thickness to a feather 

 edge, but a quarter of an inch thick. The earth covered by them 

 extended over ten by six feet. 



"It was near the northwestern edge of the asli bed that we foinul 

 the end of a large log. Numerous small logs were found above and 

 around this large one, but it did not appear that they were laid with 

 any regularity. They did not seem to be as large as those reported 

 by the men who dug the first hole in the mound. Most of them 

 were six or eight inches in diameter, and six feet in length. They 

 were badly rotted and only a few fragments were saved. I'ossibly 

 by the use of plaster of Paris sections might have been secured 

 several feet in length, but the ends were so decayed that they would 

 not have shown whether or not they were cut by stone axes. As soon 

 as the end of the log was uncovered the men were set to work uj)on 

 the ash bed with hand trowels, and they dug over the ground very 

 carefully for more than a day but found nothing of importance. The 

 ashes were very white, and resulted from the burning of large 

 quantities of wood. 



"When the end of the log was uncovered it appeared lo be filiecn 

 or sixteen inches in diameter, and being accidentally struck by a pick, 

 we were rejoiced to hear it ring as though of sound fresh wood. \V<> 

 were coriipelled to spend three days more and to cut dnwu ihc batd; 

 between the log and the edge of the mound outside so that the, trams 

 could i)ass in and out. Hy these two excavations (both were 

 widened) we moved two-thirds of the earth in I he mound. JSenr 

 the log the carlh on all sides was very loose, ami in ihr fuiin of clods

and large chunks rather than fine soil. It appeared that a circle of 

 saplings had been placed about the log. 



" The log must have been cut at a distance and curried to the mound. 

 There is no cedar within ten miles of the structure at the present 

 day, and none was seen by the early settlers. However, it may be 

 that cedar grew upon this hill in pre-Columbian times. The trench 

 extending to the northwest and uncovering the log was 35 feet in 

 width and something over 100 feet in length. 



"On Tuesday, September 4th, the excavation reached the bottom 

 of the log, and measurements gave its length as 18-5 feet with a cir- 

 cumference of 5'4 feet. Immediately below the log was a skeleton. 

 The saplings or small logs constructing the pen had been planted in 

 the earth around this skeleton, somewhat after the form of a tepee. 

 The skeleton itself lay upon the original shale in an excavation two 

 feet below the surface of the ground. It was 20 feet from the slope 

 of the mound directly above or 86 feet below the level of the sum- 

 mit. The skeleton lay with head to the north, arms at the sides, and 

 legs extended. Around each wrist were two copper bracelets. At 

 the neck and upon the chest were several hundred shell beads. 

 There were also the tusks of some large animal. The dry ashes 

 with which the remains were covered, and the great depth from the 

 surface aided in the preservation of such substances as usually decay. 

 Traces of hair Avere about the skull, the bi-ain,® dried and shrivelled, 

 was found within it, and cloth, buckskin and rude matting and bark 

 covered the remains. All of these wei'e carefully removed and 

 boxed. 



" A rough count made on the spot gave the number of beads as 480. 



' ' After removing the skeleton the log was sawed into two sections 

 and carried out and shipped. The outline of the pen was photo- 

 graphed and drawn, and the whole base of the trench down to the 

 original shale carefully dug over. The loose and partly ai'ched earth 

 on either side of the trench was carefully taken out. The possible 

 presence of other pens in the mound was settled in the negative. 

 The sides were undermined at considerable risk and the walls were 

 allowed to fall. Another inspection showed the absence of other 

 burials in the structure.

 number of authorities have been consulted. A paper will be devoted to it. —

" Subsequently work of filling up began, and when completed the 

 mound stood about 15 feet in height, flat on top and about 250 feet 

 base. 



" The crescent and the small mounds near it were carefully opened 

 but nothing of importance was discovered. Three holes were dug 

 in the crescent, one at each end and one in the center. The crescent 

 averaged three feet in height, was 118 feet across from end to end, 

 10 feet in width and 250 feet around. There is no evidence of a 

 considerable village site near either of the mounds or the crescent.

 tate, brown, 18-22 x 5-6//. 



One perithecium contained two distinct ascigerous nuclei, seeming 

 to indicate that the outer, black shell described above as a perithecium, 

 is in reality a stroma, but the material was too scanty to enable us 

 to settle this point definitely and we have, therefore, referred the 

 specc. to Melanomma.

ostiola projecting from a black, tubercular disk seated on the sur- 

 face of the wood and perforating the pustuliform-elevated epidermis, 

 but scarcely rising above it. Asci clavate-cylindrical, 40-45 x 5- 

 6//, paraphysate, 8-spored. Sporidia biseriate, oblong, 4-nucleate,

Allied to and resembling D. ocular ia C. & E. 



Valsa ribicola E. & E. 



On dead Ribes aureuvi, Rockport, Kansas, Aug. 1894 (E. Bar- 

 tholomew, No. 1,530). 



Perithecia circinate, 10-12 buried in the unchanged substance of 

 the inner bark, not penetrating to the wood or circumscrilied by any 

 black line, 230-250//. diam. , ovate-globose, with slender necks con- 

 verging, with their rounded, black, finally subumbilicate ostiola 

 erumpent around the margin of a dirty white disk. Asci clavate- 

 cylindrical, about 60 X 8;/. Sporidia biseriate above, allantoid, 

 hyaline, obtuse, moderately curved, 12-15x3-4//. The white disk 

 is only the top of a grayish-white central column around the base of 

 which lie the perithecia, in a circle 1^-2 mm. diam. 



This cannot easily be mistaken for V. rihesia Karst., which has 

 sporidia only about half as large and differs also in other respects. 



Valsa Chionanthi E. & E. 



On dead limbs of Chionanthus Virgin'ica, Nuttailburg, West Va., 

 March, 1894 (L. W. Nuttall, No. 228). 



Perithecia 4-10, globose, ]-* mm. diam., buried in the unchanged 

 substance of the bark, with convergent necks, terminating in short-

 perforating and slightly raising the bark. Asci clavate, p. sp. 40- 

 45x8-10//, 8-spored, paraphysate? Sporidia allantoid, hyaline, 12- 

 15 x35-4^//, biseriate ai)ove. 



Spermogonia ( C?/<?^/)ora Chionnnthi E. & E. ) buried in the bark, 

 flask-shaped, i-:]/' diam., niultilocular, the cells soon confluent, the 

 apex erumpent and perforated by a single pore. Sporules allantoid, 

 4—6x1-11//, borne on basidia branched above, the branches erect, 

 straight, nucleate, 7-10// long. 



Valsa Diospyri E. & E.

 Dec. 1894 (L. W. Nuttall, No. 253). 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 341 



Stroma consisting of the slightly blackened substance of the bark, 

 convex, about 2 mm. diam., not circumscribed. Perithecia 4—1 in 

 a stroma, subglobose, l-J mm. diam., necks converging and united 

 above in a small, black disk which perforates the pustulifurm-elevated 

 epidermis, but does not rise above it. Ostiola short, conic-cylindri- 

 cal, with a smooth, round opening, crowded and finally obliterating 

 the disk. Asci clavate- lanceolate, p. sp. 25 x 5/', 8-spored, para- 

 physate. Sporidia allantoid, hyaline, 8-10 x li-2'/.. Spermogonia 

 (Cytispora) in the young stroma, multilocidar gray inside, opening 

 by a single, central pore. Spermatia allantoid, hyaline, moderately 

 curved, 4-5 x 11,/. 



Valsa etherialis E. & E. 



On dead limbs of Acer rxbrum, Nuttallburg, West Va., Feb. 

 1894 (L. W. Nuttall, No. 373). 



Stromata cortical, thickly scattered, convex, 1-1 ■> mm. diam. 

 Perithecia 6-12 together, circinate, buried in the unaltered substance 

 of the bark, small, 150-250," diam., their short necks terminating 

 in an erumpent, compact fascicle of obtuse, black, slighly unbilicate 

 ostiola closely embraced by the epidermis and scarcely rising above 

 it. Asci (p. sp. ) fusoid, 15-22x4-41,", stipitate, 8-spored. 

 Sporidia biseriate, allantoid, hyaline, curved, slender, 5-6 x about 

 1,'j.. When well developed, the epidermis is raised into subdiscoid 

 pustules in which the slight protuberances indicate the position of 

 the subjacent perithecia. 



V. delicatida C. & E. has fewer, larger perithecia and broader 

 sporidia. V. microspora Cke. & Plowr. has also larger perithecia 

 and yellowish sporidia, and the ostiola are more or less distinctly 

 sulcate, indicating its close relationship to Etifi/pelhi. In V. efherialis 

 the sporidia both in and out of the asci are [jerfectly hyaline. 

 Entypella densiesimaal'^. & E. 



On dead limbs of Aralia spino.ia, Nuttalll)urg, W. Va., Feb. 1(S94 

 (L. W. Nuttall, No. 363). 



Stromata scattered, cortical, depressed-conical, 2-3 mm. diam., 

 not circumscribed, but staining the bark olive-gray. Perithecia 

 numerous, often 50-70 in a stroma, 100-120," diam., closely packed, 

 their slender necks terminating in obtusely conical, 4-cleft, black, 

 densely crowded ostiola erumpent in a brown disk surrounded by the 

 ruptured epidermis. The disk is soon obliterated, so that only the 

 crowded, black, subshining ostiola are seen. Asci clavate- fusoid, p.

sp. 25-30x4//. Sporidia biseriate, allautoid, hyaline, moderately 

 curved, 8-10xli-2//. 



Eutypella carpinicola E. &. E. 



On dead limbs of Carpinus Americana, Alcove, N. Y., Oct. 1893 

 (C. L. Shear, No. 190). 



Stromata cortical, flat, subconfluent, lo-2 mm. diam. , formed 

 from the scarcely altered, superficial layer of the inner bark, below 

 which the substance of the bark and surface of the wood is uniformly 

 blackened. Perithecia subcircinate, 3-6 together, ^-| mm. diam., 

 with thick, coriaceous walls, their short necks erumpent in a small, 

 flattened, tubercular, black disk, which pierces the papilliform- 

 elevated epidermis, and appears like a small black speck on its surface. 

 Ostiola erumpent through the disk, broad, flat, soon stellately cleft. 

 Asci slender-clavate, p. sp. 40-50 xoy, or including the slender 

 stipe, 80-100,'/. long, paraphysate, 8-spored. Sporidia biseriate, 

 allantoid, yellowish, slightly curved, obtuse, 8-10x2//. 



The perithecia lie in the superficial layer of the inner bark, and 

 when the epidermis is pulled off", this layer and the imbedded peri- 

 thecia adhere to and come off" with it. The perithecia are then seen 

 to be surrounded by a thin white layer apparently formed from the 

 substance of the bark. 

 Calosphaeria cornicola E. & E. 



On dead limbs of Cornus asperifolia, Rockport, Kansas, May, 

 1894 (Bartholomew, No. 1,470). 



Perithecia scattered or loosely collected in subvalsiform groups of 

 3-5, minute, 200-250// diam., buried in the unchanged substance 

 of the inner bark, covered by the epidermis which is raised into 

 little pustules and pierced by the papilliform ostiola. Asci clavate, 

 27-32 X 6-6 i'/., rounded above and gradually narrowed to the base. 

 Paraphyses linear, nucleate, much longer than fhe asci. Sporidia 

 biseriate, cylindrical, hyaline, curved, obtuse, 10-12x2/*.. 



Differs from C. minima Tul. (also on Cornus) in its sporidia twice 

 as long and rather broader. The scattered mode of growth is like 

 .that of C. microtheca C. & E. 

 Endoxyla acericola E. & E. 



On rotten maple wood, Granton, Ontario, Canada, Jan. 1894 

 (Dearness, No. 2,235).

 bark which becomes of a lighter color than the surrounding parts, 

 and is limited by a black line which penetrates the wood to the depth 

 of about 1 mm. Perithecia 6-12 in a stroma, globose, black, thick 

 walled, not sunk in the wood, |-1 mm. diam. Ostiola erumpent, 

 slightly projecting, conical, l)lack, not sulcate, not crowded, con- 

 nected by a thin, black crust. Asci clavate, short-stipitate, p. sp. 

 55—62x8-10//. (paraphysate)? Sporidia biseriate, cylindrical, 

 slightly curvod, yellowish and 2-nucleate at first, becoming brown

flat, with au irregularly shaped openiug. Asci clavate-cylindrical, 

 60-70 x7-8,'x (p. sp. 30-35," long), paraphysate, 8-spored. Sporidia 

 biseriate, cylindrical, smoky yellow-brown, slightly curved, obtuse, 

 10-12x2-3,'/. Stroma circumscribed by a black Hue, which does 

 not penetrate the wood. This can hardly be the Sphceria dolosa Fr., 

 said by Schw. to occur on Celastrus. It is certainly different from 

 the spec, so labeled in Sydow's Mycotheca Marchica. 



Anthostoma formosam £ & E. 



Ou bark of dead Celtu occldentalis, Rockport, Kansas, June, 

 1894 (Bartholomew, No. 1,492).

Stromata gi-egarious, subconfluent, depressed-hemispherical or 

 strongly convex, 3-6 mm. diam., purplish-black, raamniillose. Peri- 

 thecia small (about 1 mm.), scattered irregularly tlirough the stroma, 

 which is rather soft and brownish within. Ostiola crowning the 

 mamraillose projections on the surface of the stroma, papilliform, 

 soon deciduous, leaving a round perforation. The asci in the specc. 

 examined had disappeared. Sporidia brown, oblong-elliptical, subin- 

 equilateral, 7-8x3-4-/. (exceptionally 9x5/').

 Dec. 1893 (L. W. Nuttall, No. 275). 



Stroma pulvinate, 1-1 i cm. across, and about 4 nnn. thick, or- 

 bicular, covered above with a thin (j mm.) carbonaceous crust, 

 which is soon covered by a dark green layer of the ejected spores, 

 laterally and internally dirty umber color. Perithecia (which con- 

 stitute the entire inner substance of the stroma) ovate compressed, 

 and including the long, stout neck, about 3 mm. long and 1 mm. 

 broad below. Ostiola papilliform, soon covered and obscured by the 

 ejected sporidia. Asci cylindrical 100x35-4-' (p. sp. 40-45 long), 

 paraphysate, 8-spored. Sporidia uniseriate, oblong-elliptical, pale 

 brown, under the microscope 2-nucleate, 4i-5i x 2,-/. 



This is a well-marked species. The substance of the stroma, ex- 

 cept the superficial, carbonaceous layer, is friable, and in this respect 

 as well as the color resembles H. Petemi B. & C, from which, how- 

 ever, in other respects it is very distinct.

 nearly flat when dry, and then darker colored, the disk or center 

 with a faint, flesh-colored tint, i-i mm. diam. Sporules globose, 

 6—8// diam., yellowish, with a tinge of rose color. 



Difiers from H. effur/iens S. & E. in its different habitat and the 

 darker color of the perithecia.

NOTES ON THE MAMMALS OF MONROE AND PIKE COUNTIES, 

 PENNSYLVANIA. 



BY SAMUEL N. RH0AD8. 



We have much to learn respecting the mammal fauna of the most 

 densely populated and longest settled districts of the United States. 

 To no region is this remark more applicable than the States of Penn- 

 sylvania and New Jersey. In the American Naturalist for January, 

 1893, Mr. Witmer Stone and myself recorded the capture of two 

 new species belonging to genera hitherto unknown to the fauna of 

 New Jersey, and later Mr. Stone described a Cave Rat, belonging 

 to the genus Xeotoma, from South Mountain, Pennsylvania, which is 

 the first notice we have of tlie present existence of- that genus in the 

 State. 



A recent visit to the wilder portions of northeastern Pennsylvania 

 in the interests of natural history enables me to contribute the fol- 

 lowing notes to our knowledge of the mammals of the region. One 

 week in September was spent at the farm of Mr. Chas. Yaggie, 

 (1,000 ft. alt.), on the west bank of Big Bushkill Creek, in Monroe 

 County, at a point seven miles east of Cresco, where the creek enters 

 the southwestern corner of Pike County. Another week in October 

 was occupied in the vicinity of Dingman's Ferry, Pike County, 

 and for three days I was located at Porter's Lake (1,200 feet alt.), in 

 the same county. Systematic trapping of the smaller mammalia was 

 kept up during my stay at all these localities. On the results of 

 this work and of my inquiries among the woodsmen and older 

 residents of the places visited, the following notes are based. To 

 Dr. Philip Fulmer, of Dingman's Ferry, and Mr. Harvey Eilon- 

 berger, of East Stroiidsburg, the latter a veteran deer-hunter, whom 

 I had the pleasure of meeting at Porter's Lake, I am chiefly indel)ted 

 for ou|side information. The reliability of the statements of these 

 gentlemen on such subjects is unquestionable. 



The area covered by my investigations is mainly included in the 

 eivstern extension of the Porono plateau, the average elevation of 

 which, at the points visited, is from 1,000 to 1,500 feet. The greatest 




388 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



elevation attained was the summit of High Knob, 2,010 feet above the 

 sea; the lowest was at Dingman's Ferry (350 feet), on the Delaware 

 River. The greater part of Porter and Delaware townships have 

 not only been long denuded of their original forests of oak, pine, and 

 hemlock, but have of late years been frequently swept with fire. 

 This fact, combined with the stony character of the soil, gives the 

 country a desolate appearance, and has, undoubtedly, brought about 

 marked changes in the character of its fauna and flora since the ad- 

 vent of the white man. At the present time it is difficult to find, for 

 hundreds of square miles so much as an acre of mature evergreen 

 timber that does not show the ravages of fire and axe. In some 

 places the presence of a watercourse or swamp has retarded these 

 influences and we find a strip of oaks, chestnuts, and pines of com- 

 paratively recent growth to relieve the monotony of vast stretches 

 of scrub oak and bushes. Both fauna and flora combine in an in- 

 teresting manner the features of the Alleghauian, Canadian, and 

 Carolinian life- regions. 



The folloNving is a list, with annotations, of those species observed 

 by the writer or reported on by the gentlemen above mentioned: — 



1. Didelphys marsupialis virginiana (Kerr). Virginian Opossum. 



The rare occurrence of this Carolinian species in the fauna of the 

 Pocono plateau of Pike and Monroe counties, even up to an eleva- 

 tion of 1,500 feet is a fact of interest. Specimens have been taken 

 at Porter's Lake. At Dingman's Ferry they are less rare. 



2. Cariacus virginianus (Bodd.). Virginia Deer. 



A buck was killed at Schauff''s Pond the first week in October. 

 In spite of the immense range and the sparsely populated condition of 

 the country, the deer are becoming very scarce. Mr. Eilenberger 

 attributes this to the continual destruction of deer by the natives 

 throughout the year, and to the forest fires, which often overtake the 

 newly- born fawns, and in many ways so worry the older deer that 

 they leave the county. 



Last year the county newspaper at Milford published its annual 

 authenticated list of deer killed in Pike County during the game 

 season of 1893. They numbered 140. 



Mr. Eilenberger thinks a close season of three years and a law to 

 prevent the export of deer for sale would quickly and permanently 

 restock the Pocono wilderness with this noble animal.

3. Cervus americanus (Erxl.). Wapiti. 



The " Elk " was probably never as numerous in this region as in 

 the central Alleghany Mountains, those individuals taken in former 

 days being considered by the natives as stragglers from the main 

 body. The last capture in Pike County was probably not later than 

 1840 or 184o. 



Remains of the Eison and Caribou found in Hartman's Cave near 

 Stroudsburg, have been described and figured by Dr. Jos. Leidy in 

 the Penna. Geological Report for 1887. 



It is very improbable that either species co-existed in this part of 

 Pennsylvania, with Man. 



4. Sciurus carolinensis pennsylvanicus (Ord). Northern Gray Squirrel. 

 Very few were seen. They are said to be abundant in certain 



localities of exceptional food supply. The hunters frequently shoot 

 the melanistic form, which is the original variety on which George 

 Ord based his specific name for the "Small Black Squirrel" of 

 Guthrie's Geography, in 1815. 



5. Sciurus hudsonicus (Erxleben). Red Squirrel, Chickaree. 



Abundant as the sparsely wooded character of the country will 

 permit. 



6. Sciuropterus volans (L.) Jordan'. Flying Squirrel. 



Ko specimens of this animal were seen. They are reported as 

 numerous, and more frequently found in nests built among the 

 branches of a pine than in hollow trees. It is very probable that 

 this species on the Pocono mountain is nearer to the typical Virginian 

 form than to sabriniis of the Canadian fauna, as in the case of 

 Tamiaa striatns and its subspecies T. s. lysteri. 



7. Tamias striatus (L.). t'hipmuuk. 



In the more mountainous districts the chipmunk is by far the most 

 ubiquitous mammal of its class, the more favorable situations being 

 80 thickly tenanted by them as to suggest the Spermophile colonies of 

 the West. They showed no disposition to hibernate up to the last 

 day of my stay (October 14th), though the nights were often frosty. 



Pocyno chipmunks are referable to typical striatus rather than to 

 the Canadian variety, T. s. fi/st^ri, which is found in the northwestern 

 parts of Penn.sylvania.

8. Castor fiber canadensis (Kuhl). American Beaver. 



The older residents concur in the opinion that the beaver was ex- 

 terminated nearly fifty years ago in northwestern Pennsylvania. 

 Their dams and meadows are still pointed out in numerous places 

 along the Bushkill and Dingman's creeks. 



9. Mus rattus L. Black Rat. 



This least offensive member of the Old World Murida? remains 

 in undisputed possession of the barns and outhouses of the more 

 remote districts, but along the Delaware valley it has given place 

 to the following: — 



10. Mus decumanus Pallas. Norway Rat. 



As in other places where this pest has foothold, the supply far 

 exceeds the demand. 



11. Mus musculus L. House Mouse. 

 Well represented. 



12. Neotoma magister Baird. Alleghany Cave Rat. 



Kemains of this animal, both fossilized and those apparently 

 quite recent, were taken, in 1880, from Hartman's Cave in Monroe 

 County, by Mr. T. D. Paret, of Stroudsburg. 



I have as yet been unable to determine whether this interesting 

 animal is still living in that county or in Pike county. The 

 evidence from every source is negative, and this after the most dili- 

 gent inquiry. 



I personally explored several ledges, notably those of High Knob 

 and the cliffs along the Delaware south of Milford, without finding 

 a trace of their existence. It is not impossible, however, that the 

 recent habitat of this species may be traced, by isolated localities 

 along the Blue Ridge from South Mountain to the Hudson River 

 Highlands. Dr. C. H. Merriam, in a recent communication, states 

 that he believes the specimens of Neotoma, taken many years ago on 

 the Hudson near Rockland, New York, to be of this species. 



13. Peromyscus americanus (Kerr) Thomas. ^ White-footed Mouse. 

 Numerous specimens of all ages, taken in three distinctly separated 



localities, strongly indicate a local variety of this susceptible species, 

 which apparently forms a connecting link between typical Pennsyl- 



* See Ann. & Mag. N. H., Nov. 1894, p. 364. 




1894.] NATURAL, SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 391 



vania americanus and New England examples of S. a. canadensis. 

 Their longer tails an^l lack of a distinct dorsal stripe indicate this. 



The Pocono mice are of a more uniform and much duller brown 

 on the upper parts than south Pennsylvania specimens, and in old in- 

 dividuals there is no trace of the dusky dorsal stripe which is so 

 pronounced in specimens from New Jersey and New England. 

 Specimens from Pike County match one in the collection from Lome 

 Park, Ontario, and three from Clinton County, Pennsylvania. 



14. Fiber zibetliicus L. Muskrat. 

 Not abundant. 



15. Arvicola pennsylvanicus (Ord). Common Meadow Mouse. 

 Abundant, and constant to its typical characters in all situations. 



16. Arvicola pinetorum (LeConte). Pine Mouse. 



A specimen taken at Yaggie's farm, and another at Porter's Lake 

 attest the semiboreal range of this southern species. 



17. Evotomys gapperi (Vigors). Red-backed Mouse. 



A rather rare species. Four captures were made at Yaggie's in 

 the more heavily timbered swamps. This animal does not appear to 

 confine its operations to runways or underground as does the true 

 Arvicola, but forages about like Sitomi/s in more open situations at 

 the surface. 



I took none at Dingman'-s Ferry, and am of the opinion they are 

 not found much below an altitude of 1,000 feet in Pike County. 



18. Synaptomys cooper! Baird. Cooper's Lemming Mouse. 



One of these highly interesting rodents was captured in a meadow 

 bordering the Buslikill, on Yaggie's farm. It was taken in a 

 "cyclone trap," set in the runways of Arvicola pennsylvanicus, npar 

 the edge of a dry swamp. A specimen of the latter species was 

 subsequently taken in the same spot. This is the first authenticated 

 record for Pennsylvania of Cooper's mouse, though it is not improb- 

 able that the type was taken within fifty miles of this place, either on 

 that or the New Jersey side of the Delaware. 



Thi§, together with recent captures in New England and eastern 

 Canada, may now be considered sufficient to fix the type habitat of 

 Cooper's mouse east of the Alleghany Mountains, rather than west 

 of them as was once considered possible, owing to the Uita] lack of 

 recorded eastern specimens. 




392 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



lu a recent paper, Mr. Outram Bangs^ has endeavored to show 

 that Synaptomys stonei described by me from southern New Jersey 

 is a synonym of S. cooperi. 



A comparison of the three specimens of donei, taken at May's 

 Landing, with individuals taken in New England by Mr. Bangs at 

 the same season of year, show no cranial differences of value. In 

 stonei, however, there is a decided difference in the darker colors of 

 the pelage as contrasted with the New England skins and with the 

 skin from Pike County. This is manifested in the blackish-brown of 

 the back and upper head, the sooty feet and tail, and the lead- colored 

 lower parts of stonei, contrasted with the gray-brown upper parts, 

 light-brown feet and tail, and hoary under parts of the more northern 

 specimens which, as I had previously inferred, were in all prob- 

 ability taken nearest the type locality of cooperi. In these particulars 

 there is a striking correlation with the color differences pointed out 

 by Mr. Stone for his subspecies of Evotomys gapperi,* taken in the 

 same bog which furnished the types of S. stonei. On these grounds, 

 taking for granted that S. cooperi is typified by the form found east 

 of the Alleghany Mountains, I would now refer to the southern New 

 Jersey lemming mouse as Synaptomys cooperi stonei. 



My original description of stonei was drawn up from a comparison 

 with two specimens from Ohio, and, so far as it went, was apparently 

 a sufficient reason for specific separation. It is not impossible that 

 a full series of western specimens will yet indicate the propriety of 

 further division. 



19. Zapus hudsonius (Zimm.). Meadow Jumping Mouse. 



20. Zapus insignis Miller. Woodland Jumping Mouse. 



I was surprised to neither see nor capture any of these mice during 

 my stay. They had evidently just gone into their winter trance, and 

 the loveliest Indian summer weather failed to rouse them. This is 

 an interesting fact, as only a few days before my stay they had been 

 seen by " mine host," and one of the woodland species i^which I was 

 surprised to find he recognized as diffei-ent from the meadow jumping 

 mouse) was killed by him as it swam across the Bushkill. Mr. 

 Shryock took a specimen of insignis on Pocono Mountain in 1893.

21. Erethizon dorsatus (L. ). Canada Porcupine. 



This is another boreal species whose presence on the Pocono plateau 

 hiis always been rather precarious, and, with the vanishing forest 

 areas, it has become so rare that it is believed by many hunters to 

 be exterminated. The most active of these gentlemen have not seen 

 any "for several years." 



22. Lepus americanus Erxl. Varying Hare. 



Not uncommon in the higher mountain swamps. 



23. Lepus sylvatious Bachm. Eabbit. 

 Normally abundant in all situations. 



24. Felis concolor L. Puma, Panther. 



A panther, I am assured by Mr. Eilenberger, has not been killed 

 in Pike County for thirty years, all reports to the contrary notwith- 

 standing. From conversation with several hunters it appears that 

 the name "catamount" in this region is applied .to any animal, not 

 distinctly seen, which is larger than a wild- cat and has a longer tail, 

 but is .smaller than a panther ! When a very large or abnormally 

 colored wild-cat is trapped, it also may receive this higher sounding 

 title. The yell of a wild- cat is a fruitful source of "catamount" 

 stories, the horror of such an experience making the use of the com- 

 moner name a totally inadequate expression. 



25. Lynx canadensis (Desm.). Canada Lynx. 



Many residents near Porter's Lake a.ssured me that this species is 

 occasionally trapped in that vicinity. The occurrence of the lynx in 

 these parts is not attested by any reliable records known to me. 



26. Lynx rufus (Guld.). Wild-cat. 



Many pelts of this destructive animal are annually taken in both 

 counties. 



27. Cants lupus nubilus (Say). American Gray Wolf. 



I can get no information as to the date of the disappearance of the 

 timber wolf from this part of the Htate. Conservative residents set 

 it Its 'nearly forty years ago, but it is probable they existed to a much 

 later date. 



28. Vulpes vulpes pensylvanicus (Rodd.). .\nicrican Red Fox. 

 An ul)undant resident. 




394 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEilY OF [1894. 



29. TJrocyon cinereo-argenteus (Miill.). Gray Fox. 

 Occasionally taken by hunters. 



30. TJrsus americanus Pallas. American Black Bear. 



Rarely killed, but evidences of their existence are frequently seen 

 in the mountains. They hibernate in severe winters. 



31. Putorius erminea (L.). Weasel, Ermine. 



Specimens of this weasel were examined in the collection of Mr. 

 Justin Nilis, of Edgemere, Pike Co. Two of them were in the white 

 pelage. 



32. Lutreola vison Schreber. Mink. 

 Abundant. 



33. Mustela americana Turton. Pine Marten. 



I could hear of no specimens of this former resident having been 

 captured for many years. Of the Pekan, M. pennanti, none of the 

 inhabitants had any knowledge. 



34. Lutra hudsonica Lacep. American Otter. 



This fisherman is sufficiently numerous to be a nuisance to the 

 owners of game preserves along the Bushkill. I found one in a 

 trap on the banks of that stream near Yaggie's farm. They are 

 frequently seen in Porter's Lake, and Mr. Van Vliet of that place 

 states that they sometimes devour mussels in the same manner as the 

 muskrat. 



35. Mephitis mephitica (Shaw). Common Skunk. 



Normally abundant. A visit was paid to the farm near Shawnee, 

 in Monroe County, where these animals are being bred for their furs. 

 Unfortunately no one was at home at the time, and I was unable to 

 secure any data respecting the success of this experiment. A neigh- 

 bor stated that the venture was not profitable and on the decline. 



36. Procyon lotor IL.). Eaccoun. 

 Stated to be very abundant. 



37. TSorex forsteri Rich. Forster's Shrew. 



I refer a small, brown shrew, taken in Arvicola runways, in a 

 meadow near woodland, to this species, with some doubt. In its 

 small size and the character of its coloration it agrees well with 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 395 



Richardson's description. It was taken on the banks of the Bush- 

 kill where it crosses the southwestern corner of Pike County. It is 

 similar to several specimens taken in Maine and central Quebec. ^ 



38. 1 Sorex . 



Four specimens of a rather large, bluish-gray shrew answering 

 Baird's description of S. forsteri, one taken at Yaggie's and three on 

 Dingman's Creek, are very distinct from the preceding species in 

 size, color, and habits. The S. forsteri of Baird I am convinced is 

 not the same as the <S'. forsteri of Richardson. It is very probal)]e 

 that the four specimens in question are identical with the animal 

 described by Baird as forsteri. What name, among the numerous 

 existing ones, sliould be given this bluish-gray shrew with light 

 colored feet and chin and brownish neck, forearm, chest, and vent, 

 and bicolored tail, I am at a loss to know. 



39. Sorex (Neosorex) albibarbis (Cope). Eastern marsh Shrew. 



It is with no small satisfoction that I announce the discovery of a 

 member of this subgenus in Pennsylvania. One specimen was taken 

 along the banks of a rocky stream flowing into the Big Bushkill, in 

 Monroe County. It is the most southerly record for the subgenus, 

 the previous record being from Warwick, Massachusetts. After 

 going over the ground somewhat, it appears proper to endorse the 

 verification of Mr. G. S. Miller, Jr., in the Proceedings of the Bos- 

 ton Society of Natural History, in giving this shrew the name ap- 

 plied to New England examples by Prof. Cope in 1863. Specimens 

 from Lac Aux Sables, Quebec, and from Lincoln, Maine, agree 

 better, in the brownish cast of lower parts, with Prof. Cope's 

 diagnosis of albibarbis, as contrasted with the "a.sh- colored" belly of 

 S. paliistris given by Richardson in the Fauna Boreali Americana. 



In the Pike County specimen, though identical in dentition and 

 pr()|)ortionate measurements with my Canadian specimens, tlie colors 

 are much as in Richardson's diagnosis of palustris, shuwing that the 

 brown belly character is inconstant in eastern specimens. It is 

 probal)le, however, that the exceptions are in immature jielage. For 

 a full discussion of these questions, see paper by Mr. G. S. Miller, 

 .Jr., in the Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History, 

 Vol. XXVI.

 great nuisance to the mouse trapper.

A STUDY OF THE SYSTEMATIC AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION 

 OF THE DECAPOD FAMILY ATYID^E Kingsley. 



BY ARNOLD E. ORTMANN. 



In the following paper I propose to give a revision of the family 

 Atijldie with especial reference to its geographical distribution. For 

 a true representation of the geographical range of a group of animals 

 it is necessary to examine the details of the distribution of all the 

 known species, as well as to define the systematic limits of each. 

 Every error in determining a species may be followed by great 

 confusion difficult to solve by subsequent investigation. In revising 

 the known genera and species it is necessary to state the relations 

 and affinities to each other in order to get an idea of the {peculiarities 

 of the geographical distribution and to find out their cause. 



The family AttjUhv, although a small one, comprises a consider- 

 able number of ill-defined species and genera, since most authors iu 

 creating such did not investigate their relations to those already 

 known. In the typical genus Atija there are farther difficulties 

 due ^o the change of characters undergone by one species in the 

 different stages of life, which were wholly neglected by the majority 

 of authors. I have, notwithstanding, succeeded in revising the 

 family, pointing out the identity of certain species and genera, 

 defining some more correctly, and stating the affinities so as to leave 

 but a few species doubtful. I have determined a peculiar geo- 

 graphical distribution of the family agreeing well with its habits 

 and morphological characters. 



The family Ati/ithr is a very characteristic one among the Decapod 

 group of Eucyphidea. It shows on the one hand a number of 

 primitive characters, on the other a very peculiar shape of the 

 fingers of the cliehc. As I have stated in a former paper," the 

 Afijidti- are closely connected with the family Amuthephyrkhv, which 

 live at groat depths in the sea and contain, without doubt, the most 

 primitive Encj/phidfid. The morphological diHeronccs Ix-tween the two 

 families are the following: 1. The mandible in the Acanthepbyridd' 

 is furnished with a palpus (synaphi|)od), in the Atyidfe it is wanting. 



' Dccapodtii u. S(liizui)0(k'ii flcr Planktun-ICxpedition, 1803, p. IL'. 




398 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



2. The fingers of the chelae in the Acanthephyridce are normal in 

 shape, in the Atyicke they are provided with a peculiar pencil of 

 hairs. I may add that the habits of the two families are wholly 

 different, the Acanthephyridce being true marine animals, especially 

 abyssal, the Atyidce being true fresh- water forms. 



Among the Atyidm Kingsley distinguished two subfamilies, Aty- 

 ince and Ephyrina'. Since, however, there are but a few genera in 

 this family, a subdivision is needless. The genera form a continu- 

 ous series, the transition being so gradual that it is difficult to define 

 the limits of the two subfamilies. In the following synopsis of the 

 genera the first three named, Xiphocaris, Troglocaris, and Atyacphyra 

 may be regarded as belonging to the subfamily Ephyrincc as created 

 by Kingsley, the others as belonging to the Atyiiuv. Because the genus 

 Ephyra, from which is derived the name Ephyrince, is a synonym, 

 this subfamily must be renamed, and I propose to name it, if at all, 

 Xiphocarime. 



The presence of exopodites on the pereiopoda of the Xiphocarince, 

 the shape of the carpal and propodal joints of the first two pairs of 

 pereiopoda, and the shape of the rostrum constitute a very close re- 

 semblance to the Acanthephyridce. Atyaephyra makes a transition to 

 the Atyince, bearing exopodites only on the first two pairs of pereio- 

 poda, and having the carpal joints of these legs excavated at the distal 

 exti-emity. This excavation is very characteristic in the true Atyince, 

 but in Caridina the carpal joint only of the first pair of legs shows 

 this peculiarity, that of the second pair being normal. Atyoida is 

 intermediate between Caridina and Atija in the shape of the propo- 

 dal joints of these legs. Within the limits of Caridina occurs a 

 reduction of the form of the rostrum (being in the Xiphocarince 

 long and serrated), which in most species of Caridina is longer or 

 shorter and serrated, in a few very short and not serrated. In 

 Atyoida and Atija the rostrum is usually short, but now and then it 

 bears a few teeth on the inferior margin. Thus the series formed by 

 Xiphocaris, Atyaephyra, Caridina, Atyoida, and Atya is a continuous 

 one, whilst the genus Troglocaris is closely allied to Xiphocaris 

 differing only by the rudimentary condition of the eyes, due to its 

 subterranean habits in cave-waters. 



The genus Atya is the most extreme of the family. The adult 

 males of the species of this genus attain a considerable size, and the 

 third pereiopoda undergo with increase of age a change in shape. 




1894.] XATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. ^^^ 



the surface of the body and legs bearing a peculiar sculpture. The 

 most extreme species, Atya crassa, may be separated from the others 

 according to the sculpture of the body and placed in a separate sub- 

 genus, Evati/a. 



Fossil Atyidif are not known, although A. Milne- Edwards'* de- 

 scribes a Caridina nitida from the "marnes d'Aix- en-Provence" 

 (upper eocene or lower oligocene). None of the arguments given 

 by him prove that this fossil is a Caridina. The presence in a fresh- • 

 water deposit makes it probable that it belongs to Atyid(e, but for 

 the same reason Homelys minor of Meyer, ^ from the fresh-water de- 

 posits of the upper miocene of CEningen, would belong to the same 

 family.

 This genus^^ has, up to the present time, been very doubtful. 

 Examining specimens of Atyoida bisidcata from Oahu, Sandwich, in 

 the Museum of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia 

 (No. 162), I find that the hands of the two anterior pairs of legs 

 are wholly different from the typical Atya, in the same manner as 

 figured by F. Miiller in Atyoida potimirim (1. c, figs. 3 and 4). In

 but to the family Hippolvtidcs: —

 dentate below. 




1894.] NATURAL, SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 407 



Atyoida the bauds are formed like those of Caridina: the dactylus 

 (movable fiuger) is inserted on the upper margin of the propodus, 

 being shorter than the latter and forming a chela, as usual in the 

 Decapoda, consisting of a palmar portion and two fingers. In Atya, 

 on the contrary, the dactylus articulates with the propodus on the 

 posterior end of the latter, both joints lieing exactly alike and form- 

 ing a hand of a very peculiar shape among the Decapoda, the 

 palmar portion being wholly reduced, and the hand consisting only 

 of two fingers about alike in size, and connected with each other at 

 the posterior ends. The carpal joint of the chelipeds in Atyoida is 

 longer than in Atya, especially on the second pair of legs.

1* The differences between the Xew Caledonian species A. margaritacea 

 and robusta and the West Indian A. scabra are very doubtful, since the anterior 

 pereiopoda of the latter have the merus furnished with a few hairs. I suppose 

 that the locality given by Milne-Edwards for margaritacea and robusta is not 

 correct, and that there Ls no diflerence from A. scabra. (See below.) 



1^ I think the ditferences of A. gabonensis and perhaps also of A. crassa 

 are not of specific value, but that they are differences of age: A. gabonensis 

 would be a very old state of A. scabra, but it may be that A. crassa is a di.stinct 

 species.

Considerations concerning the geographical distribution of the 

 Atyidxe. 

 Some species of Atyidre were formerly considered to be marine 

 animals; there is now no doubt that this family contains only fresh- 

 water forms. This family is probably one of the most primitive 

 groups of Decapoda living in fresh- water, having immigrated at an 

 early geological period. 



Only two species, Caridina unjcki and gracilirostris, are recorded 

 by Weber^" as found iu a few cases in brackish waters of Sumatra 



1* This locality is not yet published : there is one adult male fromTobago in 

 the museum at Strassburg.

and Celebes.'" I believe, that this occurreuce may be considered as 

 a re-adaptation of these two species, as they are found also in fresh- 

 water. Since the genus Caridina is not a primitive one, while the 

 genera of the Xiphocaruue are so, and live exclusively in fresh- 

 water, it is very probable, that the fresh-water habit of the family 

 must be regarded as the original manner of living. I believe, there- 

 fore, that the Ati/idir, even of the Indian Archipelago, are not im- 

 migrants from the sea, as stated by Weber (1. c. , p. 543), but "true 

 localized fresh- water animals, forming an old element of the fresh- 

 water fauna."'' 



The main differences of the Atyidcc and their supposed ancestors, 

 the Acftnthephyrkkv, are morphological as well as biological, the 

 Acantheplujridiv being true marine, and essentially abyssal animals. 

 To all appearance the morphological diti'erences are causally connected 

 with the change of habits. The peculiar j)encil of hairs at the distal 

 extremities of the fingers is adapted for securing the special food 

 required, as described by F. Miiller in Atyoida potimirim.''^ No 

 doubt the other species of Atyida' feed in the same manner. I cannot 

 say whether the absence of the synaphipod of the mandible is due to 

 the same cause, since the function of the synaphipod is unknown, but 

 it may be in connection with it. On the other hand the habits of 

 the Acanthephyridu: are wholly unknown, so that we cannot compare 

 this family with the Atyldcf, but it is very probable that the mor- 

 phological differences of the Aciuitltepltyridn' correspond to differences 

 in the habits, especially in securing food. 



We can state, briefly, that the Atyidce are closely allied to the 

 most primitive Eucyphldca, forming a peculiar branch of develop- 

 ment very early separated from the main stem, now represented by 

 the AranthephyridcE. Their several characters are connected with a 

 change of habit, and with the immigration to fresh-waters. 



The geographical range of the Aiyidn- embraces the whole of the 

 circumtropical parts of the world, members of the family being re- 

 corded from all the localities explored within these limits. Only in 

 two localities does the range exceed the true tropics : in Japan, where 

 it extends aa far north as Tokio, and in the Mediterranean province,

where it extends northward to southern France and southern Austria. 

 This nearly exclusive distril)Utiou within the tropics, at least in the 

 warmer climates, shows that the family was probably also in former 

 times an inhabitant of the warmer parts of the world, and the possi- 

 bility is granted that the immigration into fresh-water took place at 

 a time when climatic zones were not at all differentiated, a tropical 

 climate prevailing everywhere. If this immigration took place in 

 a later time, the poles having undergone a cooling, one could not 

 understand the presence of the family in all parts of the tropics, as 

 well as the occurrence of some genera (Xiphocariss, Caridina, Atya) 

 on both of the present great continents, the eastern and western. 



After the cooling of the northern and southern circumpolar regions^^ 

 the range of the family was divided into two parts : an eastern com- 

 prising the tropical Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Pacific islands, 

 and a western comprising tropical America.^* The most primitive 

 genera of the family were restricted in range by the concurrence of 

 the more extremely developed ones, and the latter preserved a more 

 circumtropical distribution. 



It is very interesting to examine the geographical range of the 

 genera and species from the point of view here given. 



The most primitive genus, Xiphocaris, shows a distribution the 

 peculiarity of which can only be understood by supposing that the 

 range of this genus was formerly a more extended one, but that in 

 most parts of the world the representatives were exterminated. Only 

 three species survived, one of which lives now in the fresh-waters ot 

 the West Indies, the other in Indo-Malaysia, from Japan to Australia, 

 and the third in New Zealand. From the intermediate countries 

 species of this genus are not recorded. The Indo-Malaysian species, 

 Xiphocaris compressa, repeats, as we know at present, this peculiarity 

 in a reduced manner, being only recorded from Japan, the island of

'^* In case the Atyidce immigrated from the sea into the fresh-water after 

 this separation, it is very probable that the geographical distribution would not 

 be a circumtropical one, but that dittereut groups immigrated into the western 

 and eastern continents. We know another group of Decapoda. in which the 

 latter is the case: the family Telplntsidce. one subfamily of which the Telphiis- 

 incz, being restricted to the tropical and subtropical parts of the eastern continents

Adenare, and from Queensland.-* The closely allied genus Troglo- 

 caris, the only species of which might be regarded as a fourth form 

 of Xiphocans, lives in the subterranean waters of Carniola, a per- 

 fectly isolated locality in no way connected with the others named. 

 The third primitive genus, AtyaJephyra, is found near the locality of 

 Troglocaris on the northern borders of the Mediterranean Sea. It 

 is somewhat less primitive. The scattered localities at which are 

 found the species of these three genera forming the subfamily Xipho- 

 carime are no doubt the remains of a more universal distribution in 

 former times : the species now living show the character of true 

 survivals. 



In the subfamily Atijina, the genus Atyoida shows a survival 

 character similar to that of the Xiphocarince; being recorded from 

 the Sandwich Islands, Tahiti, and southern Brazil. But this genus 

 must be the subject of farther study. 



The genus C'iridi)ia appears to be nearly a circumtropical one. 

 Its range is divided into two very unequal parts: -the one comprising 

 the West Indies and containing only one species, the other compris- 

 ing a continuous area of the old world and containing at least nine- 

 teen other species. This area extends from South Africa along the 

 east coast to the southern borders of the Mediterranean Sea and 

 to Persia, crossing the islands of the Indian Ocean and Indo- Ma- 

 laysia to Japan and Australia. '■'' Species of this genus have not yet 

 been found in West Africa, in southern Asia (except Ceylon and 

 Siam ), and in the Pacific islands, but it may be that some species 

 will be discovered later in these countries. 



This distribution of the genus can only be understood by suppos- 

 ing that it was present before a separation of the eastern and western 

 parts of the tropics took place, and that the extended ran irc of former 

 times is now restricted to the tropical parts of the continents border- 

 ing the Indian Ocean and to its islands, and to the islands of eastern 

 Asia from Japan to Australia. The occurrence of one s])ecies in the 

 Nile and in the rivers of Algiers is due, I believe, to a more recent 

 immigration from the central and eastern parts of Africa, not unlike 

 the occurrence of Pahcmon tiitolicus."

414 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



It is very probable that farther investigations will prove that the 

 range of Caridina is a somewhat different one, since fresh-water 

 Crustacea of smaller size are mostly neglected by collectors, and the 

 fauna of the fresh- waters of most tropical countries are very little 

 known. Accordingly, the view given above on the geographical 

 distribution of Caridina may, perhaps, have to be changed later. 



The distribution of the most extreme genus of the family, Atya, 

 is. somewhat similar to that of Caridina. It is found, like the latter, 

 in the West Indies and ludo- Malaysia, but there are some modifica- 

 tions. One species is known from West Africa, which is identical 

 with another described from the Orinoco, and there is recorded one 

 species from the Cape Verde Island, identical with the common West 

 Indian form. The presence of identical fresh- water species, both 

 in the West Indies and in West Africa, is a very remarkable fact, 

 but not an isolated one among the Decapoda. We know another 

 group of fresh-water Crustacea which shows the same peculiarity. 

 Of the genus PaUvinon there are three species described from West 

 Africa, two of which, Pal. jamaicensis (^voUenhoveni) and Pal. 

 olfersi, are likewise present in the West Indies, and one, Pal. macro- 

 brachion, is closely allied to a West Indian species, Pal. acanthio'us.^^ 

 In Atya the identity of species of both continents bordering the 

 Atlantic is due, no doubt, to other reasons than in Palcemon, the 

 latter being a very recent genus, having immigrated to the fresh- 

 waters quite recently, while some species are now immigrating from 

 the sea to brackish and fresh- water. On the contrary, the immigra- 

 tion to fresh- water of the ancestors of Atya took place a long time 

 ago, and, I think, this fact indicates a former connection of Africa 

 and America. 



The other range of the genus Atya extends over the islands of the 

 Pacific from Sumatra to the Samoan islands. None is recorded from 

 southern Asia, from the islands of the Indian Ocean, or from East 

 Africa." 



The two species described by A. Milne- Edwards from Isew Cale- 

 donia, A. margaritacea and robusta, are very doubtful, as I have 

 stated above. I do not know another example of a fresh-water 



'^^ See Ortmann, ibid., p. 747. — Palcemon vollenhovetii is certainly the same 

 as Pal. jamaicensis; in the paper quoted I supposed them to be nearly allied, but 

 distinct species. 



2' Only Hilgendorf (v. d. Deckcn's Eei-sen, III, 1, 1869, p. 101) records a very 

 doubtful species from the Seychelles, belonging, perhaps, to Alyoida. 




1894.] NATURAL, SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 415 



Decapod restricted to New Caledonia. Our present knowledge of 

 the fresh-water fauna of the Pacific islands leaves it very improbable 

 that New Caledonia has an isolated fauna, differing from that of the 

 other islands. It is probable, on the contrary, that species found in 

 New Caledonia will be found also in other islands, but since A. 

 Milne- Edwards, in 1864, described these tAvo species, they have never 

 been recorded from any place in the Pacific. It may be added that 

 the differences of these species from the West Indian, A. scabra, given 

 by A. Milne-Edwards, are scarcely at all present. I am, therefore, 

 induced to suppose that both are erroneously recorded from New 

 Caledonia, the true locality being the West Indies, and that they are 

 identical with .4. scabra. 



If these considerations are correct, the genus Atya can be divided 

 into two groups: the one containing the species bearing on each side 

 of the rostrum at the base a spiniforra angle, the other containing 

 the species without a spiniform angle. To the first belong the species 

 ^4. scabra, gabonensis, and crassa, their range extending over tropical 

 America and West Africa; to the second belong ^4. moluccensis, 

 spinipes, and brevi rostris, the range of which comprises the Indo- 

 Maiaysian and Pacific islands. The last named species, brevirostris, 

 forms a transition from the second group to the first. Then the 

 range of the genus Atya would be divided into two parts, each con- 

 taining a separate group of the genus, and this peculiarity could be 

 explained by supposing that these two groups may be developed 

 separately from each other after the separation of the former con- 

 necting range of the genus. This conjecture agrees with the fact, 

 that Atya is the most extreme genus of Atyldiv, and with its supposed 

 recent age. 



We know that some fresh-water animals are rapidly distributed 

 over great distances, either in the adult or in the larval state, but in 

 the AtyidcB we know nothing of the means of distribution. 



Comparing the other Crustacean Decapoda we may say, that the 

 Atyidfc have not been transported to great distances. Nor is it 

 probable that the eggs can endure a long time without water, or 

 that tl]e larvio or the adult animals can leave the water for any 

 length of time. Transportation of the species of Atj/idn, in either 

 the active or passive state, from one fresh-water system to another 

 over the land or through the air, cannot be supposed, at least over 

 great distances. Neither can the Atyidir live in the sea, so that the 




416 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



most important topographical harriers to distribution would be 

 widely extending oceans and large tracts of land without fi-esh- 

 water. The Pacific Ocean forms a barrier of the first kind, while 

 the second may be partly connected with the climatic conditions of 

 the warmer parts of the world. Smaller areas of sea and land, 

 however, may be crossed by some forms, as is shown especially in the 

 distribution of some species of Caridina and Atya^°. The means of 

 distribution are certainly very limited, and therefore a great number 

 of species are confined to very narrow districts. 



Lastly, the ancient character of the family induces me to suppose 

 that there are also biouomic barriers, the Atyidce not being able to 

 immigrate to localities occupied by other fresh-water animals better 

 equipped for the struggle for existance. 



I regret very much that exact observations on the habits of the 

 species of Atyidce, on the biology and bionomy, are wholly absent. 

 It is very probable that the different genera and species on farther 

 examination will show some differences, especially that the best de- 

 veloped are more resistant to external influences. 



The conditions of geographical distribution of the Atyidce are as 

 follows : — 



1. The A^?/idcB cannot endure cooler climates. (^Climatic barriers.) 



2. They are true fresh-water animals. (Oceans and tracts of land 



without water form topographic barriers.) 



3. Being animals of an ancient type, they are probably restricted 



by the occurrence of other fresh-water animals. (Biojiomic 

 barriers.) 



4. The faculties of distribution are very limited. 



The Atyidce are, therefore, confined to the fresh- waters of the 

 tropics and subtropics; the distribution of the genera and species, 

 especially of the more primitive ones, shows a remarkable character 

 of survival. Only Caridina and Atya are of a more recent charac- 

 ter, extending over continuous areas within the tropics. Because of 

 the antiquity of the family it has no relations among the recent forms 

 of the literal regions of the tropical seas.^^ 



^o Caridina typus, icycki, nilotica ; Atya scabra, molitccensis, spinipes. 



'^ Such relations to the Allantic, Indo-Pacific, and Western-American 

 regions (see Ortniann, Jenaische nenkschr., VIIl, 18fi4, p. 76) are not at all 

 evident, none of the well-known genera or species being limited by the borders 

 of one of these regions.

A NEW JUMPING MOUSE FROM THE PACIFIC SLOPE. 

 BY SAMUEL N. RHOADS, 



Zapus trinotatus sp. nov. Type, ad $ , No. 300, Coll. of S. N. Ehoads. Lulu 

 Island (mouth of Frazer Kiver). British Columbia. May 31st. 1892. Col. 

 by S. N. R. 



Description. — Size large, equalling Zapus princeps from Colorado, 

 but with a shorter foot. Colors aliove as in princeps, but darker, 

 the yellowish- gray suffusion on back and sides of that species being 

 replaced in frinotatits by brownish-fulvous ; the cheeks, ears, upper 

 head, circumocular region, and upper surface of tail much blacker. 

 The upper surface of wrist is black witli fulvous anterior edging 

 reaching to foot. Lateral stripe separating upper and lower body 

 colors, dark fulvous, narrow, and reaching from hams to and around 

 front of fore legs, and nearly meeting across throat. The throat, 

 chin, belly, vent, and lower (inner) surfaces of legs are a clear soft 

 white. In the center of lower throat and on each side of the sternum 

 is a well-defined spot of fulvous about S mm. long and 8 mm. wide, 

 the pectoral spots being the larger and more strongly colored. The 

 fulvous of these spots does not reach base of hairs, their roots being 

 white, as in the hairs of the fulvous lateral stripe. 



Skull differing from any described form in its great relative width 

 and depth, to length, the zygomit being more flaring, the parietals 

 more (tonvex, the inci.sive foramina larger and broader postei'iorly, 

 the postpalatal notch more acuminate and indenting the palatal 

 bone.s as far as m. 2. Tlu; upper premolar is larger than in princeps 

 or hudsoiiius, its crown rising to the grinding plane of the true 

 molars and becoming functional, bearing on its inner and posterior 

 rim a crescentine loop partially enclosing a central cusp whose base 

 lies on the outer anterior angle of the crown. In princeps, its 

 nearest ally, this tooth is not functional, or rarely so, its apex falling 

 below the grinding plane, and, as in hudsoniiis, consisting of a 

 simple peg-like process with the folding being more or less obsolete. 

 The lower molars of trinotatus are relatively larger than in princeps 

 or hudsoniiis, the posterior loop of m. 1 and the second and last loops 




422 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



of m. 2 projecting exteriorly beyond the outer edges of their inter- 

 vening loops, forming a very irregular outline not seen in the latter 

 species. In trinotatus the inferior m. 8 is relatively large, one-and-a- 

 half times as long as wide and made up of a more complicated series 

 of loops than in the same tooth of its allies. The coronoid process 

 is much lengthened, wide across base, blunt and distinctly notched 

 at tip. The angular process of mandible is perforated by a single 

 minute foramen ; in the other forms it is raultiperforate or incised by 

 two, conspicuous, oblique slits. 



Measurements of Type (\\i vaWVimQiei'^) . — Total length, 234; tail 

 vertebrae, 139; hind foot, 32. (Topotype, length, 235; tail, 142; 

 foot, 32.) Skull — Total length, 24; basilar length, 17.5; zygomatic 

 width, 13; nasal length, 9.8; interorbital constriction, 4.8; height 

 of cranium, 9.8; length of mandible, 12.5; width of mandible, 6.8. 



Two males of this species were taken at Lulu Island. Another 

 from Mason Co., Washington, is referable to it. 



Zapus trinotatus is the West Cascade representative of Z. princepa. 

 Several specimens of jumping mice taken at Lac La Hache, B. C. , 

 and at Vernon, in the same province, are referable to princeps, 

 whose range will probably be found to be limited to the East Cas- 

 cade and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States and of 

 southern British America. It is probable that the range of hud- 

 soniiis will be found to reach far to the west in northern British 

 America. 



I am indebted to Mr. G. S. Miller, Jr., for the loan of specimens 

 of Z. princeps for this study.

ON A COLLECTION OF BATRACHIA AND REPTILIA FROM THE 

 ISLAND OF HAINAN. 



BY E. D. COPE. 



The collection on which the following notes are based was made 

 by the Rev. Francis Oilman, who sent them to Prof. Chas. S. Dolley. 

 Prof. Dolley placed them in my hands for identification and descrip- 

 tion. 



Hyla arborea var. 



This form agrees in structural features with the true Hyla arborea 

 of Europe, but differs in coloration, not only from this but from the 

 two subspecies which are known from Eastern Asia [H. a. chiiieusis, 

 and H. a. japonica). 



The extended hind limb marks a point between the eye and the 

 nostril with the heel. The vomerine teeth are between the internal 

 nostrils, but the posterior borders of the fasciculi are behind a line 

 which connects their posterior borders. The diameter of the tym- 

 panum is about half that of the eye ; and the interorbital width is 

 greater than that of an eyelid. The length of the head to a line 

 connecting the posterior borders of the tympana, enters the total 

 length 3.2 times. The lingers are slightly wel)bed, and the toes are 

 about two-thirds webbed. There is a heavy glandular fold from the 

 orbit to the shoulder. 



The color is uniform green above, and uniform pale (perhaps yel- 

 lowish) below. There are no spots of any kind anywhere. A light 

 brown band extends from the eye through the tympanum and disap- 

 pears about the shoulder. It has neither dark nor pale l)orders, and 

 is hence very indistinct. A similar band extends from the eye to 

 the nostril. Upper lip not pale bordered nor spotted. Total length, 

 40 mm.; do. of hind leg from groin, 59 mm.; of hind foot, 27 mm. 

 Holarohlis doUeyanus sp. nov. Plate X. Hk. 1. 



Scales in seventeen rows. Superior labials eight, all higher than 

 long, the fourtli and lifth entering the orl)it, the sixth in contact with 

 the inferior [wstocular only, the seventh in contact with the lower 

 postocular, and more extensively with the parietal. Loreal trape- 




424 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



zoid; oculars 1-2; temporals 0-2. Internasal mutual contact short; 

 parietals short, wide, truncate posteriorly, bounding both postoculars 

 posteriorly. Pregenials bounded by four labials, a little longer than 

 postgenials. Gastrosteges, 164, obtusely angulated ; anal entire; 

 urosteges, 36. 



Color above yellowish-brown; below brownish-yellow. No marks 

 on the head ; on the superior surface of the body there are indistinct 

 cross bars, which consist of the dark edges of scales, at intervals of 

 two and three scales; they are not continued on the tail. Total 

 length, 400 mm. ; of tail, 58 mm. 



This species probably resembles the H. siviiilionis Gthr. (Rept. 

 Brit. India, p. 215, PI. XX, fig. E.); but it differs materially in 

 having but one preocular; in the absence of an anterior temporal ; 

 in the contact of the anterior genial with four labials, and in the 

 longer postgenial. The color above is pale brown, not olive. 



The hemi penis of this species is smooth, and without spines, 

 flounces, or ruches; agreeing with that of the H. ancorus, as figured 

 by me in the "American Naturalist," 1894, Plate XXVII, fig. 4. 

 These characters refer the genus to the Calamariinae, with OUgodon, 

 etc. (See "American Naturalist," 1893, p. 480.) A character of 

 subordinate value seen in the hemipenis of H. ancorus, which is not 

 present in H. dolleyanus, is a shallow pocket on each side of the sul- 

 cus spermaticus. 



There is a rudimental right lung 5 mm. in length, communicating 

 with the trachea by foramen. No tracheal lung. 



This species is dedicated to my friend, the distinguished zoologist, 

 Dr. Chas. S. Dolley. 

 Pareas moellendorffii Bcettger. 



A single male specimen gives me an opportunity of determining 

 the position of this curious genus. With some external resemblance 

 to the American Leptognathus, it combines not dissimilar dentition 

 and squamation ; it is to be presumed that the habits are not dis- 

 similar. Examination of the hemipenis shows, however, that it is 

 really related to the Calamariinse, and to Simotes. This organ is 

 without spines or ruches, and has only flat obtuse papillae on the 

 middle third of its length, the distal portion being smooth, with a 

 few feeble papilhe at the apex. It is deeply bifurcate, the basal 

 portion being quite short. At the summit of the middle papillose 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 425 



section is an oblique membranous flounce with a lobate margin. 

 No tracheal lung ; and I could tind no right lung. 



Amphiesma stolatum L. 



In this species the hemipenis displays the usual natricine charac- 

 ters of a basal hook, and small sj)ines reaching to the apex, without 

 ruches or flounces. The spines are, however, coarser than in most 

 other species. The organ, moreover, is undivided, and with un- 

 divided sulcus, and as A. stolatum is the type of the genus, the 

 latter must be defined accordingly, and not as divided, as I inferred 

 from an examination of allied species which have been referred to 

 it by authors.' These supposed species of Amphiesma which I have 

 examined, which have divided hemipenis and diacranteriau denti- 

 tion, are also characterized by the presence of fossie of the hemipenis 

 from the center of each of which a spinule issues. These are the 

 Amph. tigrmu.n and A. ceylonense, and they belong to my genus 

 Bothrodijtes, which name should take the place o^ Amphiesma in my 

 original Prodromus, 1. c. The genera of Natriciuic with basal hooks 

 will then be as follows : — 



I. Fusiform types ; hemipenis and sulcus undivided. 

 Hemipenis simple; anal divided; 



One internasal, scales keeled ; Haldea B. & G. 



Two internasals, scales keeled; Amphiardis Cope. 



Two internasals, scales smooth; Vinjiiiia B. tt G. 



Hemipenis with two apical papillae; anal entii*e.

Hemipenis without papilla; " Diplophalbts Cope. 



bb. Dentition diacrauterian. 



Hemipenis without papilla; Bothrodytes Cope. 



Trimerodytes balteatus gen. et sp. nov. Plate X, fig. 2. 



Char. gen. — Characters of Natrix, but the prefrontals fused. 

 The dentition is syncranterian or coryphodont. Hemipenis undi- 

 vided, sulcus simple. 



The single species on which this genus is proposed is represented 

 by an individual which, while apparently not very young, is at the 

 same time not fully grown. As a consequence the spinules of the 

 hemipenis are not ossified, appearing as fine flexible papillae. This 

 is the condition normal to immature snakes, as I have observed in 

 the genera Drymobius, Bascanium, etc. 



Char, specif. — Scales in nineteen rows, smooth, except on the tail, 

 where all except the lateral rows are feebly keeled, and for a short 

 distance in front of the vent, where about three dorsal rows are al.-^o 

 weakly keeled. Each internasal longer than wide. Frontal rather 

 wide, with straight borders, the anterior a little longer than the 

 lateral. Parietal moderately elongate, angulate posteriorly, and 

 embracing only the superior postocular. Loreal higher than long ; 

 oculars 1-2 or 3; temporals 1—2. Superior labials nine. These are 

 differently distributed on opposite sides, so that the numbers may be 

 in other specimens, eight or ten. One labial forming most of inferior 

 border of orbit, which may be the fourth or fifth ; the angle of the 

 succeeding labial enters the orbit. On one side two i)lates represent 

 the single last upper labial on the other. Inferior labials nine; pre- 

 genials shorter than postgenials, and bounded by six labials. Gas- 

 trosteges , 202; anal, 1-1; urosteges, 84. 



Color black, crossed by white or pale yellow rings. These have 

 a width of half of a scale on the middle dorsal region, and widen 

 downward, covering two or three gastrosteges. They are frequently 

 broken on the middle line, the halves alternating, both on the back 

 and belly. The labials and oculars have yellow centers, and there 

 is a yellow line from near the angle of the mouth to near the middle 

 line above. A pair of yellow spots are on each side of the common 

 suture of the parietal plates. 



Total length, 377 mm. ; tail, 80 mm. 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 427 



Bothrops erythruru8 Cantor. 



Before leaving the Ophidia I add some remarks on the penial 

 characters of some species which do not enter the present collection, 

 and which I have recently examined. 



The genus Anomalodon Jan (Lioheterodon Bouleuger, from a 

 Dom. nud. of Dum. & Bibr. ) has the hemipenis deeply divided and 

 covered with minute spines, without large hooks at the base. It is 

 to be referred to the Pseudaspidina^ of my Prodromus, approaching 

 the genus F^eudaspis m. of S. Africa. Boulenger has shown that it 

 has the natricine hypapophyses. 



The Australian Dlpsas fasca Gray, differs from the geuus Bipsas 

 ia the absence of spines from the hemipenis ; the characters are 

 otherwise as in Dip.<a-i. I propose to name this new genus Llophal- 

 Iks, with L. fitscus as type, 



I propose to separate Drpnobius percarinatus Cope from Dri/mo- 

 bius as the type of a distinct genus under the aiame of Cacocalt/x. 

 It differs from that genus in the structure of the terminal half of 

 the hemipenis. Instead of the usual papillose calyces, there are 

 rows of spines on longitudinal folds, and tlie apex is covered with a 

 few large, shallow, smooth-edged calyces, which are separated from 

 the spinous portion by a continuous transverse fold, i. e., the apex is 

 capitate. I have compared this organ with the corresponding ones 

 of Drifviobius margaritiferiis (type); D. pantheriinm; D. reticula- 

 tus; D. Infddaertii, and D. pulcherrimus, where they arc essentially 

 alike. The genus Cacocidyx is quite different from any other form 

 of Colubriuie. 



The Cyclophin major Gunth., presents the penial characters of the 

 Colubrinie, but has an es{)ecial peculiarity not shared by any other 

 species with which I am acquainted. In the proximal internal wall 

 of each calyx is a transverse comb of a few spines. These do not 

 graduate into the spines of the middle of the hemij^enis, which are 

 well developed. The borders of the calyces are serrate to papillose. 

 As this type is clearly not referable to any known genus, I projwse 

 to distinguish it by the name of Enterliitnis. It is evidently not 

 very nearly relatetl to Lio/)eltis and Ciidophix of N. America. 



The genus Marruprotodoii (Guich.) has the apical region of the 

 hemipenis calyculate, and the papillic at the angles of the calyces 

 are spinous (i.e., ossified; to near the tip. There are numerous 




428 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



spines below the calyces. Hemipenis simple. The genus belongs to 

 the Dipsadinse. 



Psammodynastes has a divided penis which is spinous to the tip 

 and not cal3^culate. The spines are arranged in the branches in 

 oblique series, pinnate to the sulcus. Not knowing the structure in 

 Psammophis I cannot determine the affinity of the genus. 



In Osceola {elapsoidea) the penial characters are like those of 

 Ophibolus doliatns; i. e., the calyces are numerous and fringed. In 

 Ophibolus they are ver}' few and have entire borders. I thei'efore 

 place 0. doUatus in Osceola. All the species of Ophibolus agree in 

 the character assigned. 



The Dromicus flamlatus Cope, of the S. E. coast regions of the 

 United States, has the penial structure of Bhadinaea Cope, and does 

 not belong to Dromicus. The organ is undivided, and the calyculate 

 region is capitate. We have here a case parallel to the genus 

 Liodytes, of which the type species was supposed to be a Helicops. 

 Both these Floridan forms turn out to be allies of types found on 

 the North American continent. 



Causus Licht. has the character of other Solenoglypha, i.e., 

 coarsely spinous at the middle, and calyculate above, and deeply 

 bifurcate. In C. rhombeatus, the only species examined, there is at 

 the middle of each branch a longitudinal fissure-like interruption of 

 the calyculate structure which contains feeble laminae on its sides and 

 fundus. The calyces are papillose. 



As regards the structure of the lungs, I have to add observations 

 on two species not previously examined. In Anomalodon madagas- 

 caricDsis there is no tracheal lung nor auricle of the l,arge left lung. 

 The rudimental right lung measures about 6 mm. In Psammojihis 

 irregularis the structure is similar in the points mentioned, except 

 that I could not discover a rudimental right lung.

THE BATRACHIA AND REPTILIA OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYL- 

 VANIA WEST INDIAN EXPEDITION OF 1890 AND 1891. 



BY E, D. COPE. 



The species enumerated or described in the following pages were 

 collected in the course of a yachting expedition conducted by Pro- 

 fessor J. T. Rothrock, at that time Professor of Botany in the Uni- 

 versity of Pennsylvania, among the northern islands of the West 

 Indies. Collections were made at the following islands of the 

 Bahama group: New Providence, Eleuthera, Watlings Island, 

 Crooked Island, and Great Inagua. They next touched at the east- 

 ern point of Jamaica, at Port Morant, and later at Port Luce at the 

 western extremity. The last collections were made at Grand Cay- 

 man Island. The zoologist of the expedition .was ]N[r. J. Percy 

 Moore, now Instructor in Comparative Anatomy and Zoology in the 

 University of Pennsylvania. To his care we are indebted for an 

 excellent series of the vertebrata of the islands visited. The 

 collection of Batrachia and Reptilia enumerated in the following 

 pages is one of the best ever made in the region. Collections from 

 Crooked Island and Inagua are especially welcome as but little was 

 previously known of their vertebrate fauna. Mr. Moore has fur- 

 nished me with notes of his observations, which are added in their 

 places, in quotation marks. 



New Providence. 



Trachyoephalus septentrionalis Tsch. 



"This large tree toad was met witli abundantly everywhere in the 

 Bahamas and on Grand Cayman. About the sisal plantations on 

 New Providence great numbers could be taken, one or more being 

 concealed beneath the bases of the thick, fleshy leaves of almost 

 every plant. Their cry, when taken in the hand, is very startling, 

 having much of the force, quality, and pitch of the cry of a young 

 infant. They are said to spawn in the wells." 



Anolis principalis Linn. 

 Anolis sagrae D. & B. 



" This is one of the most widely distributed and abundant of 




430 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



Bahaman Auoles. The species is most characteristic of the more 

 northerly islands; of those visited hy us they are ver}- abundant on 

 New Providence, fairly swarming on Eleuthera, and less common on 

 the islands south and east. We failed to find this species on Fortune 

 Isl. and Great Inagua. They are equally at home on the ground 

 and in trees, preferring to seek their food on the former. They are 

 very pretty, when raised high on the fore-legs, with head elevated, 

 and body in a quiver of excitement, they pause to detect the move- 

 ment of an insect, upon which they spring with much agility, and 

 devour in an instant. Their principal food is ants, which they seek 

 along fences, by the roadside, among the trees, and in and about 

 houses. Like the other Anoles they are fond of sunning themselves 

 and lie on stones or fences with the legs stretched lazily along the 

 sides of the body. On the island of Eleuthera, where they are 

 known to the natives by the name of Iquana, they are fond of lying 

 on the branches of bushes overhanging the fresh- water ponds. Out- 

 side of the Bahamas A. sagrw was met with in Jamaica, where they 

 are particularly abundant on the north shore about Port Lucea. " 



Anolis distichus Cope. 



" Common on New Providence, and less so on Eleuthera. Their 

 habits in general resemble those of A. sagrce, but the species is 

 especially common on the ground in banana and sisal plantations." 



Anolis oligaspis sp. nov. Plate XI, fig. 5. 



Tail little compressed at the base (mostly lost), and with a larger 

 median dorsal row of scales. Scales minute, a few dorsal rows 

 scarcely larger; ventrals much larger, smooth. Tibia about as long as 

 head to posterior border of orbit. Occipital plate oval, larger than 

 ear opening (transversely divided in the single specimen), separated 

 from supraorbitals by one row of scales. The supraorbitals are in 

 contact, and they are continued as a row of two large scales only be- 

 tween the anterior one which borders the orbit, and the scales of the 

 can thus rostralis. The first pair of these two large scales is separated 

 by a single row of small scales; the second is separated by three 

 rows, of which the median is the largest, and continues to between 

 the nares. Thus at the second large scales there are five rows of 

 scales across the muzzle between the canthal scales, of which the 

 lateral and median are larger than the other t\\o. All scales of 

 muzzle without keels; a shallow basin between large rows. Canthal 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 481 



scales three. Supraoculars forming a disc of seven smooth scales, 

 which is in contact throughout its inner l)order with the supraorbital 

 series. Loreals in five rows. 



The muzzle is rather short, and the extended hind limb reaches to 

 the orbit. There are thirteen laminse beneath the second and third 

 phalanges of the third and fourth toes. 



The only specimen is a female, and it is greenish-gray with a 

 brown band on each side of the vertebral line, which is similar in color 

 to the sides. Throat with longitudinal series of blackish spots. 



Length to vent, 44 mm. ; do. to line of meatus auditorius, 14 mm. 

 Length of fore liral), 19 mm. ; do. of hind limb, 34 mm.; of hind 

 foot, 14 mm. 



This species is remarkable for the reduction in the number of its 

 head scales. It resembles no other species nearly, unless it be the 

 Anolis krugii Peters, of Porto Rico, which I have not seen. There 

 are numerous discrepancies in the description of the latter. For in- 

 stance, in A. krugii, the ventral scales are keeled, the superciliaries 

 are separated by a row of scales ; the supraorbitals are keeled ; 

 there are four enlarged dorsal rows, and the color is quite difiereut. 



Amiva thoracica Cope. 



"A common and conspicuous species, especially in the northernmost 

 of the Bahama Islands. Like its allies this is essentially a ground 

 inhabiting species, living among the loose coral boulders, in the 

 crevices of which secure shelter and concealment may be found. 

 They love to lie on stones basking in the warm sunshine, l)ut are ever 

 alert and dart away like a flash, their course being indicated by a 

 blue .streak. They are extremely difficult to catch, and although 

 very abundant on Cat Isl., and almost equally soon Eleuthcra, only 

 a very few specimens were taken."

 Anolis principalis L. Tarpum Bay. 



"A most beautiful species of essentially arlioreal habits. Widely

 found among tiie smaller trees and bushes, leaping actively about

 TIngualia maculata D. & f;. Tarpum Bay. 



' ' This species is common throughout the Bahamas visited by our 

 party, but the U. cana was found only on Great Inagua. The species 

 have similar habits. They are found during the day coiled up 

 under stones in the dryest, hottest places Avith such incompatible 

 company as centipedes, scorpions, and tarantulas, for they are very 

 mild tempered little snakes." 



Crooked Island. 

 Anolis principalis brunneus subsp. nov. Plate X, fig. 3. 



This form is allied to A. principalis. It has the same shaped 

 head, and the same squamation of the body, with similar proportions 

 of limbs. It falls outside the usual range of variation of J., princi- 

 palis in some points of squamation of the head, and in the color. 

 Thus the supraorbital rows of scales are continued forward, to be- 

 tween the nostrils, not reaching the canthus rostralis, and are in con- 

 tact throughout, except an occasional separation by a single scale. 

 Thus there are but 4-5 rows across the front instead of 7-8 in pi'in- 

 dpalis. There are but three loreal rows, the middle one consisting 

 of but one or two scales, while there are 5-7 in the A. principalis. 

 The six or seven supraocular plates are of subequal size and are 

 obscurely keeled, and are in immediate contact with the supraorbi- 

 tals ; in A. principalis they are of unequal size and are separated 

 from the supraorbitals by a series of small scales. On the inferior 

 side of the second and third phalanges of the fourth digit of the 

 posterior foot there are 18, 20 lamellae, in the A. principalis there 

 are 24. 



The color is different from that of any stage or variety of the A. 

 principalis. Above and on the sides leather-brown. On each side 

 two dark brown stripes, the superior the wider, and sending cross 

 processes towards the middle line of the back. Posteriorly it is 

 broken up into a series of dark brown spots which become wider, and 

 finally unite in crossbars on the tail. Below light yellowish, the 

 throat indistinctly lined with darker.

Total length, 123 mm.; do. to vent, 43 mm.; to line of auricular 

 meati, 14 mm.; of fore limb, 15 mm.; of hind limb, 27 mm.; of 

 hind foot, 12 mm. 

 Liocephalus carinatus Gray. 



Scales in 46 rows; 5-6 supraoculars; 3 introfrontonasal scales. 



"Generally distributed throughout the Bahamas; this species is 

 especially abundant on Crooked Isl., were Anoles are comparatively 

 uncommon. The larger vegetation is very sparse here and loose 

 piles of coral rock near the shores are overgrown by a comparatively 

 open bush or scrub. It is here that the species abounds, scurrying 

 about on the ground and only rarely climbing into bushes. They 

 are very inquisitive creatures and come close up to look at one, then 

 running back a yard or two, pause again, and raising themselves on 

 the fore-legs, look about with elevated heads, a strange admixture of 

 curiosity and timidity, ready to run again at the slightest alarm. 

 While in running the Anoles only slightly raise the tail from the 

 ground, and the Ameivre drag it straight out behind, this species 

 elevates the tail high over the back, where it forms, pig- like, a 

 spiral coil, which peculiarity has gained for them the name of curl- 

 tail lizards. This species hides among the rock crevices, and large 

 numbers take advantage of the burrows of the land crab ( Gecarci- 

 nns) as places of concealment. Though active, they are easil)'^ 

 caught in the hand, or by means of a grass noose. Their tails part 

 very readily and one is frequently rewarded for his pains with only 

 that squirming member. Highly carnivorous and very voracious 

 they apparently do not pause even at cannibalism, as was illustrated 

 once when a detached tail fell from my hand to the ground, where 

 its movements attracted the attention of an individual of the same 

 species, which ran down from the rocks fully twenty-five feet away, 

 picked up the tail and bore it off. A few minutes later it was seen 

 with the tip of the still squirming tail of its neighbor hanging from 

 between its teeth. On another occasion a warl)ler which was shot and 

 had fallen to the ground, was found guarded by a large curl- tail 

 which seemed about to attack it."

dominal scales smooth. The affinities are with the A. cybotes Cope, 

 of San Domingo, but the scales of the sides and most of the back 

 are twice as large, and the median dorsal rows are not abruptly- 

 larger than those adjoining. Frontal ridges low, and median basin 

 shallow. Tibia shorter than length from muzzle to ear. Scales of 

 muzzle moderate, smooth. Superciliary rows separated by one row 

 of scales except for a short distance, where they are in contact. 

 Supraoculars 13-15, smooth, those of internal and adjacent rows 

 subequal, the whole separated from the supraorbitals b}^ small scales 

 of different sizes. Occipital plate equal auricular meatus, separated 

 from supraorbitals by three rows. Five loreal rows ; four canthal 

 scales, the latter connected with anterior supraorbital by two rather 

 large scales, which are separated by four rows of scales. In front of 

 the basin there are nine rows of scales counting across the muzzle, 

 of which the median row is much enlarged. In A. cybotes there are 

 but two or three rows in the frontal basin, and the middle row on the 

 muzzle is not enlarged. Twenty-four lamellae under the second and 

 third phalanges of posterior fourth toe. Fan of male reaching to 

 between humeri. Male with postanal plates rudimental. 



Color ashen, thickly mottled with small, black spots on the sides 

 and back, and upper surfaces of limbs. Spots smaller on nape. 

 A black band from nostril through lower eyelid to ear. Fan green- 

 ish-black in alcohol. In a smaller specimen, perhaps a female, as 

 the fan is small, there is a dark band across the supraoculars, and 

 the occiput is reticulated with black. The median dorsal region is 

 covered by a dark brown band. 



Total length of male, 195 mm. ; do. of head to ear, 10 mm. ; do. 

 to vent, 72 mm.; do. of fore limb, 31 mm.; do. of hind limb, 55 

 mm. ; of hind foot, 23 mm. 



This species differs from its nearest ally, the A. cybotes, in the 

 larger scales, the different arrangement of the muzzle plates, the 

 more numerous supraorbitals, and mostly widely in the coloration. 

 In size it exceeds that species. It is dedicated to my friend Mr. 

 J. Percy Moore, Instructor in Zoology and Comparative Anatomy in 

 the University of Pennsylvania, who captured the type specimens. 



"This handsome species was found only on Great Inagua where it 

 is quite common. They are distinguishable at sight, during life, 

 from any species met with elsewhere by their comparatively large 

 size and pale gray-brown spotted color, which on occasion changes to 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 435 



a more or less intense brown. Though very active in their move- 

 ments they are readily approached and captured, but have an un- 

 comfortable habit of seeking shelter among the thick clumps of a 

 very spiny Agave." 



Anolis oinnamomeus sp. nov. Plate XII, fig. 6. 



Tail compressed, with enlarged median dorsal row ; ventral scales 

 keeled. A few keeled median dorsal rows nearly equal to ventrals, 

 but soon graduating into the smaller laterals. Caudal scales keeled. 

 Tibia shorter than head to ear ; extended hind leg reaching to eye. 

 Fifteen lamin?e on second and third joints of posterior fourth toe. 

 Occipital plate equal to auricular meatus, and separated from supra- 

 orbitals by three rows of scales. Supraorbitals in contact with each 

 other, the anterior separated from the canthal row by two large scales. 

 Between the latter is a shallow basin containing two series of scales. 

 Three canthal scales. Between them on the front part of the muzzle 

 may be counted seven scales, of which the median is large, being one 

 of a median longitudinal roAV. Scales of muzzle smooth. Supra- 

 ocular few, only six large ones and a few small ones at their external 

 border; not, or faintly keeled, and separated from the supraorbitals 

 by a single row of small scales. Five and four rows of loreal scales. 

 The muzzle is of intermediate length. 



Color above brown ; sides pale brown ; inferior surfaces pale. 

 Back, sides and throat speckled with rather coarse black dots, which 

 are on the back rather frequently fused into short lines both longitu- 

 dinal and transverse. A black spot on the loreal region ; the lower 

 eyelid dark. Top of muzzle Va front of orbits pale. 



Ivcngth from muzzle to vent, 45 mm. ; to posterior line of ears, 13 

 mm.; of fore limb, 19 mm.; of hind limb, 24 mm.; of hind foot, 

 15 mm. 



This rather small species is allied to the A. eyhotes and the A. 

 moorei It agrees with the latter in the character of its scales, but 

 differs from both in the small number of both the supraocular plates, 

 and the sulxligital lamelhr, and in the contact of the supraorbital 

 plates, and the reduced number of the scales on tlie muzzle. It is 

 darker Colored than the A. moorei, but is similarly speckled with 

 black. 



Two specimens were collected by Mr. Moore, which from the small 

 size of their fans I suspect to be females.

Liocephalus sp. 



"A distinct Liocevhalus, probably L. sehreibersii Gray, was 

 plentiful on Great Inagua, but the specimens have been mislaid. It 

 is a rather smaller, more active species which carries the tail elevated 

 but not curled." 



Ungualia cana Cope. 



On comparison of this species with others of the genus I have 

 occasion to reassert the distinctness of the U. Judiana Cope from the 

 U. maculata with which it is united by Boulenger in the Catalogue 

 of Snakes in the British INIuseum, Vol. I. In the original descrip- 

 tion (Proceed. Amer. Philos. Soc, 1879, p. 273), the statement is 

 made that the scales are in twenty-seven longitudinal rows, which 

 they are at some points ; but at the stoutest part of the body they 

 are in twenty-nine rows. In TJ. maculata they never exceed 25 rows, 

 and are usually 23. There are no interparietal plates ; these are 

 always present in the U. maculata. 



In the genus Ungualia the anal claws are of irregular occurrence. 

 In seven specimens before me they are present in only three. The 

 same is true of the genus Charina, also usually regarded as peropo- 

 dous. In two specimens before me they are wanting. 



Amiva leucomelas sp. nov. Plate XII, fig. 8. 



Ten rows of abdominal scales. Caudal scales oblique, diverging 

 backward and outward on each side of the median series, keeled, 

 the keels parallel to the middle line. Nostril within the border of 

 the internasal plate. Nasal triangular, small ; one very large loreal 

 plate; one preocular plate descending to the fourth superior labial; 

 four suborbitals in contact with the labials except the fourth. Six 

 narrow superciliaries ; four supraorbitals; frontal not transversely 

 divided. Two parietals on each side of the interparietal, which they 

 do not quite equal in length, while each is about equal in size to the 

 rather elongate interparietal. Two rows of small, smooth post parie- 

 tals. Gular scales nearly uniform; some larger ones at the middle 

 of the mesoptychium. Dorsal scales coarsely granular, round. 



Three rows of plates on the forearm, the external much the widest; 

 one row on the humerus with a much smaller row on each side of it; 

 the former not continuous with the large. row of the forearm. Three 

 large and a few small preanal plates, which are continuous with the 




1894.] NATURAL, SCIENCES OF PHII.ADELPHIA. 437 



abdominals. Femoral pores thirteen. Thirty-four transverse rows 

 ou the abdomen. 



Median dorsal region brown, becoming blackish and then black 

 anteriorly, the lateral border pale brown posteriorly, but becoming 

 white anteriorly. A broad, black lateral band from orbit to above 

 femur, bounded below by a narrow white stripe. Head brown on 

 sides and above; limbs lead colored above. Inferior surfaces bluish- 

 white ; tail with the scales darker at the base than elsewhere. Near 

 the base of the tail the darker color is leaden, but at the middle and 

 beyond it passes to bluish and blue ; and the pale portion varies in 

 a corresponding way to pale blue. No black lines on posterior face 

 of femur. 



Length to vent, 57 mm.; do. of fore limb from axilla, 16 mm.; 

 do. of hind limb, 3^ mm. ; of hind foot, 21 mm. 



This very handsome species is allied to the A. polops Cope of St. 

 Croix, but differs in several respects. The median dorsal scales are 

 not enlarged, as in that species, and there are five fewer femoral 

 pores, and the lateral caudal scales are keeled, not smooth. The 

 coloring is quite different. In the A. polops the dorsal region is 

 olive-gray, and there are three white longitudinal lines on each side 

 and a pair of black lines on the posterior face of the femur. 



"This iiandsome species was found only ou Great Inagua where they 

 occur very commonly. The colors are very bright during life and 

 this fact, as well as their activity, makes them very pretty objects to 

 watch. Much smaller than Ameiva thoracica, which w'as not found 

 on Inagua, and perhaps even more active, they are extremely diffi- 

 cult to catch, and specimens were only secured by recourse to the 

 shot-gun. They frequent the paths and roadsides and the rocks 

 about the shores." 



Jamaica. 

 Bafo agua Daud. 



"This great toad is very common in the meadows along the streams 

 about Lucea, Jamaica, where they are called frogs. Quite nocturnal 

 in habit they spend the day in burrows beneath stones ami rubbish, 

 and at night come forth to splash through the water and rank grass 

 along the shores of .streams. When the light from a bulls-eye 

 lantern is flashed ou them they crouch and attempt to conceal them- 

 selves. In the water they are quite at home and swim easily, but 

 on land progress in a very lumbering way, the legs seeming too weak 




438 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894.

 rubbish."

A single example of this handsome black and orange tree- toad 

 was taken at Port Lucea clinging to a shrub overhanging a stream. 



XiphocercuB valenciennei D. & B. 



Port Morant. 



"This fine species was rarely met with and was collected only at 

 Port Morant and Port Antonio, Jamaica. At the former place 

 lizards of all kinds are uncommon owing to the abundance of the 

 mongoose, which animal has exerted a marked influence on the 

 reptilian fauna of Jamaica. Snakes of all kinds have been ex- 

 terminated so completely that we failed to find a single specimen. 

 The same is true of the larger ground- inhabiting lizards. 



The present species lives on and about the trunks of cocoauut 

 trees." 

 Anolis grahamii Gray. 



Port Morant; Port Antonio; Port Lucea. 



"Notwithstanding the mongoose, this species is generally abundant 

 about the coast of Jamaica, and on Grand Cayman, though noticeably 

 more so in thickly settled districts, where they are familiarly kuown as 

 the clucking lizards, and welcomed into houses, over the walls and ceil- 

 ings of which they run with apparent ease. Their habits were studied 

 about Kingston and elsewhere. At midday in the hot sunshine along 

 fences they are seen at their best. They extend and retract the 

 brilliant scarlet goitre in a regular rhythmical way as a flattened 

 fold, the body meantime passing through a remarkable series of color 

 transitions from rich brown or almost a chocolate color, through pale 

 browns, grays, dull greens to bright blue- greens, some individuals 

 retaining more of one color, some more of another, sometimes plain, 

 sometimes spotted, until one almost wearies in counting the variations 

 and changes. The colors are more or less related at any moment to 

 the Qolors of surrounding objects. This is a very active lizard which 

 runs with great swiftness along the fences and branches of trees, often 

 taking flying sidelong leaps of surprising length, but clinging surely 

 by means of the adhesive disks, by which they are enabled to cling 




1894.] NATURAL, SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 439 



even to such smooth surfoces as window panes. At Port Morant 

 they were especially abundant in the cocoauut groves concealing 

 themselves, when alarmed, beneath the matting which envelops the 

 bases of the leaf petioles. Their food, in the vicinity of Kingston, 

 is largely ants and wood ticks." 



Anolis flabellatus sp. uov. Plate XII, fig. 7. 



Allied to A. grahamii but with the abdominal scales smooth, the 

 supraorbital scales continued as a distinct series of larger scales to 

 the canthus rostralis; the scales of the muzzle not keeled. The 

 occipital scale is about as large as the auditoiy meatus, and it is 

 separated from the supraorbitals by one or two rows of scales instead 

 of four or five as in the A. grahamii. Supraorbitals separated by 

 one row of scales ; supraorbitals, 13-14 keeled, and of various 

 sizes, becoming smaller externally. The frontal ridges are not 

 elevated as in the A. liiiea top us Gray, but the front is flat, nearly as 

 in A. grahamii. Three scales separate the anteri'Or supraorbital 

 from the canthus rostralis, which itself is marked by five scales. 

 Seven rows on the muzzle between the canthus ; ten rows in the A. 

 grahamii. Twenty- one lamellte under third and fourth phalanges 

 of posterior fourth toe. The tibia is shorter than from the muzzle 

 to the ear, and the extended hind foot reaches to the eye. The 

 dorsal and lateral scales are of equal size. The fan is large, extend- 

 ing posterior to the axilla3 in males. 



Color above brown, lighter on the sides, and marbled on both 

 regions with darker brown. Below pale with darker reticulations on 

 the chin. Color of fan not dark. 



Length to vent, 46 mm. ; to ear, 13.5; do. of fore limb, 21 mm.; 

 of hind limb, 36 mm.; of hind foot, 15 mm. 



This species need only be compared with the A. grahamii, to 

 which it is allied. Besides the characters mentioned, it is smaller, 

 and is of a different color; the A. grahamii being more or less green, 

 and not tending to brown. It resembles more strongly the A. 

 grahamii conspersus of Garman, which is rather intermediate be- 

 tween the A. flabellatw and the A. grahamii. The A. g. con- 

 upersus is as large as the latter, and is peculiar in coloration. 



From Port Morant and Port Lucea; abundant. 



"A slender, pretty species found on the north shore of Jamaica at

chiefly among the dense masses of aerial roots which hang from the 

 trunks and branches of the Indian fig {Ficua mdica), where it drives 

 the would-be collector almost to distraction by quietly slipping into an 

 ever present crevice just as his hand descends on the spot where, in 

 his mental image, it still rests. Its slender form and brown color 

 admirably fit it to its habitat. This species was also found just within 

 the entrance of a cave at Port Antonio. ' '

A small gecko, perhaps the young of this species, was taken by 

 Mr. Moore at Port Morant, about January 12, 1891. Its colors are 

 much more elegant than those of any specimen either adult or young 

 which I have seen, but the scale characters are the same. The color 

 is light fawn, darker on the head; a dark band through the eye; lips 

 whitish spotted. A black scapular spot with a small, yellow center 

 on each side; behind it a delicate vertical yellow line. Narrow 

 vertical yellow lines on thQ sides, and indistinct brownish dorsal 

 cross-bars behind the middle of the length. Length of head and body 

 27 mm. 



Sphaerodactylus goniorhynolius sp. uov. 



Lateral and anterior surfaces of rostral plate separated from 

 superior surface by a curved, solid right angle, which is not con- 

 tinued posteriorly. Dorsal scales about equal to ventrals, acute, im- 

 bricate, keeled. Scales of top of head similar but smaller. Ven- 

 tral and pectoral scales similar to dorsal, keeled. Tail covered 

 everywhere with similar scales, whose free apices give it a chaify ap- 

 pearance. Eyelid covered from middle of front to superior posterior 

 border with large, chaffy scales which are larger than those on the 

 front. Upper part of rostral plate split. Labials \ . Muzzle 

 short, its length from orbit equaling from orbit to auricular meatus. 



Color dark marone above, below light reddish-brown, the colors 

 blending on the sides of the body, but separated by a sharp undulat- 

 ing line on each side of the tail. An indistinct, undulating pale 

 .line extends from the neck on each side of the back and dorsal 

 surface of the tail, which sends short processes inward, especially on 

 the tail. This line is only clearly seen in the dead animal when it

is in spirits. Gular region paler, uniform. Total length, 43 mm.; 

 length of body and head, 23 mm. 



This species is well distinguished by the form of the end of the 

 muzzle, and by the keeled ventral scales. The supei*ciliary scales 

 are also entirely peculiar, as they present several free points upwards 

 and backwards, in place of the spine- like process found in the other 

 species. Port Antonio.

"Found only on Grand Cayman, where it is common among stones 

 by the roadside, and in stone walls. Habits similar to L. carinatus.'" 



Aristelliger praesignis Hallow. 



"Only one specimen taken on Grand Cayman. It clung so firmly 

 to the tree trunk on which it rested that much of the skin of the 

 bark was torn away in removing it. The habits of this gecko are 

 similar to those described for its allies ; while its sluggishness and 

 stupidity distinguish it sharply from the other lizards here described." 



Alsophis angulifer caymanus Garman. 



' ' This snake is very common on Grand Cayman, and I recall one 

 stone wall by the roadside that was fairly alive with them. On the 

 top stones many were lying warming in the sunshine, while from 

 crevices everywhere heads protruded. Their movements and general 

 actions resemble what is most familiar in our garter snakes."

 GEOLOGICAL AWARD. 



The 'Committee appointed to recommend to the Academy a suit-

 report that in examining the claims of the many savants from those 

 countries which have not yet been represented by an award, the 

 attention of your Committee was naturally arrested by Gabriel 




444 PROCEKDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



Auguste Daubree, of France, whom it has selected by unanimous 

 vote for the honor. 



Your Committee takes great pleasure in recommending that the 

 Hayden Medal of this year be awarded by the Academy of Natural 

 Sciences to Professeur Gabriel Auguste Daubree, Membre de I'lnsti- 

 tut et Grand Officier de la Legion d'Honneur. 

 Very respectfully, 



J. P. Lesley,

 Theo. D. Rand, 

 Persifor Frazer, 



Chairman. 



Gabriel Auguste Daubree was born in Metz, June 25, 1814, 

 and is therefore no^v in his eighty-first year. He graduated from 

 the Ecole Polytechnique in 1834 and immediately received a com- 

 mission to assist in the geological exploration of Algeria. He was 

 called to the chair of geology in Strasbourg in 1839 and was Dean of 

 its Scientific Faculty in 1852. He was appointed Engiueer-iu-Chief 

 in 1855. In 1861, upon the death of the distinguished Cordier, he 

 was selected to replace him in the Museum of Natural History, and 

 as Professor of Mineralogy in the Ecole des Mines as well as in the 

 Academie des Sciences in Paris. 



He was Director of the Ecole nationale des Mines for a number 

 of years, and while filling this responsible office was invariably 

 courteous and generous in allowing foreigners the privilege of using 

 its collections and library, and in assisting them in all ways to attain 

 what they sought. 



His writings have been: numerous, original, and important, and 

 it is to his genius and patience that we owe much of our insight into 

 the intricate causes of crystalline structure, and the creation of the 

 branch of experimental geology. 



In 1841 he published his "Amas des minerals d'etain," in which 

 a new theory was announced of the origin of the puzzling distribu- 

 tion of tin in its ores. In 1846 he published researches in Norway, 

 and a theory of the occurrence of gold in the Rhine valley. 



At intervals he published a long series of memoirs of exceptional 

 originality and interest, among which may be mentioned "Arsenic 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 445 



in combustible minerals," "Volcanic rocks," "Sea water," "Thermal 

 8pring8 and metallic lodes," "Chemical composition of planetary 

 bodies," and finally, the crown of his labors, "La geologic experi- 

 mentale," "Recherches experimentales sur les forces qui ont du 

 produire le metamorphisme" (1857-1860), and the classic work of 

 recent vears "Les eaux souterraines. " 



He has also published a valua])le work "Experiences synthetiques 

 relative aux meteorites," and "Classification adoptee par le Musee de 

 I'Histoire Naturelle de Paris."

A NEW INSECTIVORE FROM THE WHITE RIVER BEDS. 

 BY W. B. SCOTT. 



The American Tertiary formatious have yielded a surprisingly 

 scanty insectivorous fauna. Many names have, it is true, been pro- 

 posed, but for the most part, these names have been given to such 

 fragmentary and uncharacteristic specimens, that they remain mere 

 nom'ina nuda. Only one family, the Leptididcc, is at all well under- 

 stood, and the ancestors of even the peculiarly American recent types 

 are still quite unknown. 



During the past summer Mr. M. S. Farr, of the Chicago Univer- 

 sity Expedition to the White River bad lands of South Dakota, had 

 the good fortune to discover an insectivorous type new to the Ameri- 

 can Tertiary fauna, and representing an undescribed genus. For 

 the opportunity of studying and desci'ibing this very interesting spe- 

 cimen, I am indebted to the kindness of Professor Baur, to whom I 

 desire to express my very sincere thanks. 



The specimen consists of the facial region and mandible, ^nth nearly 

 complete dentition, of a small animal, which upon examination, proves 

 to be a member of the family Soricidre, or shrews, though not alto- 

 gether agreeing with the definition of that family as usually given. 

 This is the first of the family to be found in any Tertiary horizon of 

 North America. 



The genus may be called Protosorex and is defined as follows : 

 Maxillary dentition much as in /So jt^;, but with less reduced third 

 molar and smaller internal cusps on last premolar. Mandible with 

 four minute teeth between the molars and the large, procumbent 

 incisors. In all other known Soricidce the number of such teeth is 

 ttvo, except in one species of Myosorex, which sometimes has three. 



The species, P. ei'assus, sp. nov., is characterized by the rather 

 short and broad face, vaulted palate, straight alveolar border, and 

 by the relatively large size. 



The type specimen is of an individual rather advanced in life, and 

 all the facial sutures have disappeared. The upper surface of the 

 fronto-nasal region is straighter, broader, and niore flattened than 

 in the recent species of Sorex. The zygomatic arches have already 




1894.] NATURAL, SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 447 



completely disappeared, the suborbital portion of the maxillary ter- 

 minating in a rounded surface. The infraorbital foramen is very 

 large and occupies the usual position above P* and ^. In advance 

 of i>i the muzzle is quite sharply constricted and narrowed. The 

 palate is quite deeply vaulted and concave transversely ; between the 

 molars of the two sides it is broad, but narrows rapidly in front of 

 them. No foramina or failures of ossification are visible in the 

 palate. The posterior nares have a similar shape and position to 

 those of Sorex, but differ in the raised and thickened front border. 

 The anterior portion of the muzzle is slender and tubular and the 

 narial opening is small and terminal. The horizontal ramus of the 

 mandible is proportionately stout and bears a single conspicuous 

 mental foramen beneath the first molar. Condyle and angle are 

 missing. 



In the upper jaw the crowns of the anterior teeth are broken away, 

 leaving only the fangs. The first incisor was large and compressed 

 like that of Sorex, but it is impossible to determine whether it had 

 the basal cusp found in that genus. This is followed by four minute, 

 single- fanged teeth, the homologies of which are doubtful. The last 

 premolar is as large as, though much less complicated than a molar; 

 it resembles the corresponding tooth of Sorex, but the internal cusp 

 (deuterocone) is relatively less expanded and basin-shaped. The 

 molars have the same construction as in Sorex; the last molar is 

 much the smallest of the series, though less reduced than in the 

 modern genus. 



The large lower incisor has lost most of its crown, but it would 

 appear to be less entirely procumbent than in Sorex. Behind this 

 tooth come four minute and closely crowded teeth, with compressed, 

 chisel-like crowns, of which the first and the fourth are slii^htly 

 larger and more prominent than the others. As in the up})er jaw, 

 the molars are like those of Sorex.

Protosorex represents the most primitive type of Soricidce which 

 has yet been discovered, as is shown by the large number of teeth 

 which it has retained. It is, however, not the most ancient form of 

 shrew known, the phosphorites of Quercy, which are as old or older 

 than the White River beds, having yielded species of Sorex (Amphi- 

 sorex Filhol). This points to a very high antiquity of the family.

PTERODRILUS, A REMARKABLE DISCODRILID. 

 BY J. PERCY MOORE. 



Among a number of additional new species of Discodrilidte, which 

 have come into the writer's possession, are two which differ so remark- 

 ably from the known type of structure of these interesting parasites 

 that an immediate description of their peculiarities seems desirable. 

 A new genus, Pterodriliis, is proposed for them, characterized by the 

 presence on certain of the post-cephalic somites of paired dorsal a])- 

 pendages. chiefly developed from the muscular layers of the body 

 walls. The genus resembles American Discodrilids hitherto de- 

 scribed in the presence of a second pair of vasse deferentise in the Vlth 

 post-cephalic somite, in addition to the pair in the Vth somite, whicli 

 alone is present in the European Branchiolxlella. Both pairs open to 

 the exterior in the Vlth somite by the usual form of efferent apparatus. 

 The dorsal and ventral cuticular jaws are similar to one another, and 

 each is normally bi-laterally symmetrical, though not infrequent varia- 

 tions affecting this symmetry are notable. The external openings of 

 the anterior pair of nephridia are united in a common muscular vesicle 

 having an outlet on the dorsum of somite III. 



In the two species at present known the spermatheca is a simple 

 sac with glandular and muscular walls, opening on the ventral 

 middle line of the Vth somite. The atrium shows the u^al division 

 into bursa, penis sheath, and glandular atrium, the vasa deferentia 

 opening into the latter, which is short and stout. The ovaries are 

 attached to the p(tsterior face of the septum VI-VII, and the 

 ovipores are situated between the major and minor annuli of 

 somite VII. 



As usual in the Discodrilidie the nervous system consists of a 

 doubly bi-lobulate suf)ra-<KSophageal ganglion, united by partly gang- 

 lionic circum-a'sophageal connectives with the ventral nerve cord, 

 which develops three pairs of deeply bilobed cephalic ganglia, eight 

 pairs of clouble post-cephalic ganglia, and a posterior nerve mass 

 composed of three fuscfl pairs of double ganglia, making a total of 

 eleven post-cephalic ganglia, corresponding to the eleven hi-annulate 

 body somites.

450 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEJIY OF [1894. 



The vascular system presents the usual supra-intestiual vessel with 

 its anterior portion modified to form a heart, a supra-neural vessel, a 

 peri-enteric blood sinus, four pairs of vascular arches in the head, 

 one pair each in the 1st and Vllth post-cephalic somites, and one 

 pair uniting: the longitudinal trunks posteriorly in the IXth and Xth 

 somites. Two pairs of cephalic, and eight or ten of caudal, adhesive 

 glands are present, as well as circum-oral and hypodermal mucous 

 glands. An inconspicuous clitellum is developed on somites VI and 

 VII. No salivary gland, such as is found in Bdellodrilus illumina- 

 tus, is present. 



Regarding the function of the dorsal organs there is little to say. 

 A priori one would expect them to be respiratory, but the apparent 

 entire absence of bloodvessels, which are unrevealed after a careful 

 study of sections, would tend to throw strong doubt upon such an 

 interpretation. Irregular spaces are evident here and there between 

 the muscle fibres, but these appear to be continuous with the inter- 

 muscular spaces which are developed between the circular and longi- 

 tudinal muscle fibres of the body walls, and have not been traced 

 into any communication with the body cavity. Until an opportunity 

 is aflTorded of studying living examples in their proper habitat, and 

 observing the uses to which these organs are put, no opinion can be 

 vouchsafed. 



The two species are ot relatively minute size, and were at first re- 

 garded as larval stages of another Discodrilid, until sections revealed 

 the presence of perfectly mature spermatozoa and ova, some of which 

 latter were in the course of extrusion through the ovipores.

In this species, which is described from sections and specimens 

 mounted entire, the body is terete throughout, or owing to the in- 

 crease in thickness of the dorsal walls of the major annuli, appears 

 somewhat compressed at these points. The somites VI, VII, and 

 VIII are of about equal diameter, those anterior and posterior to them 

 tapering respectively toward the head and caudal disk. Bi-auuula- 

 tion of the body somites is very marked. The head is rather slen- 

 der, and consists of a circum-oral annulus divided into thick entire 

 dorsal and ventral lips, and two similar post-oral rings. The caudal 

 sucker is a muscular disk of simple form, and about the diameter of 

 the 1st post-cephalic somite; its axis coincides with that of the body 

 somites. 



Dorsal organs are highly developed in this species on post-cephalic 

 somites III, IV, V, and VIII. Somites VI and VII, and in less 

 degree, II also, exhibit slight dorsal thickenings of the body muscu- 

 lature. On the dorsum of tlie major annulus of somite III the 

 body walls rise into a high compressed transverse ridge or plate, 

 which fades out on the sides of the somite, and is produced laterally 

 into a conspicuous, forwardly projecting trilobed wing, the anterior 

 division of which flares outward and extends far forward over 

 somite II, usually ending in a slightly bifid expansion. The remain- 

 ing lobes are simple conical tines, which project upward and slightly 

 outward. The two wings flare so strongly that the distance be- 

 tween their apices is about 1 \ times the diameter of the somite. 

 Their shape is very strongly suggestive of the antlers of a young 

 moose, hence the name given to this species. The generic name was 

 also suggested by this species, in which the dorsal organs have a 

 wing-like aspect not seen in the other species. 



The dorsal appendage of the Vlllth somite is also highly de- 

 veloped, and similar to the one just described. Its lateral wings, 

 however, are less conspicuous, and are directed posteriorly instead of 

 anteriorly, and also flare outward more conspicuously. The whole 

 organ is strongly concave behind, while that on the Ilird somite is 

 similarly concave before. A small gland, closely resembling a clitellar 

 gland, is sometimes present (in two out of three series of sections) 




452 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



embedded in the base of the or^an on each side. On tlie IVth 

 and Vth somites the appendages are less hiirhl}^ developed, but are 

 similar, the low dorsal ridges bearing on each side a pair of slender 

 and simple cylindrical processes. 



An examination of figures 1^, Ic, and Id will make the structure 

 of the characteristic dorsal appendages clear. The transverse dorsal 

 ridges are built up chiefly of short, thick, longitudinal muscle fibres, 

 which extend between the anterior and the posterior covering of 

 hypodermis. Spaces partly filled with a connective tissue network 

 are observable among the fibres, and a similar more extensive space 

 (a, figs, lb, Ic), separates the muscles of the dorsal organ from the 

 longitudinal muscles of the body walls. A few^ vertical muscle fibres 

 are also developed in the lateral margins of the ridges. Over this 

 firm muscular basis the hypodermis, with the circular muscle layer, 

 extends, and this alone, with a core of loose, spongy tissue, probably 

 derived from the subdermal connective tissue, forms the terminal 

 processes and lobes, (fig. Id.) In the formation of these dorsal 

 appendages, from the body walls, it would seem that the loose fold of 

 hypodermis and circular muscle fibres that rises freely from the longi- 

 tudinal muscle fibres is pinched up, as it were, at several points, from 

 which the skin and connective tissue underlying it proliferate to 

 form the marginal processes, while the space remaining becomes filled, 

 save for a few narrow clefts, with muscle fibres that proliferate from 

 the ends of the longitudinal muscle fibres of the body walls at the 

 points where these meet the hypodermis. 



The alimentary canal is enlarged to form a saccular stomach in 

 the four anterior body somites, while posteriorly it is narrow and 

 tubular, and, with the exception of a slight transverse loop in the 

 Vllth and Vlllth somites, proceeds directly to the anus on the dor- 

 sum of somite X. 



The jaws are small, measuring .02 mm. in breadth. They are of 

 similar form, being quadridentate, with a median pair of long, 

 sharply-conical, widely- separated, and divergent teeth, bent at a 

 nearly right angle from the plane of the somewhat quadrangular 

 basal plate. In extreme lateral positions are a pair of inconspicuous 

 blunt teeth. When in position the basal plates are fixed in the 

 cuticle of the pharynx, and the points of the teeth of the two jaws 

 cross in the pharyngeal lumen. 



The spermatheca lies in the Vth somite to the left of the intestine. 




1894.1 NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPPIIA. 453 



Its lower half is narrow and cylindrical, its upper abruptly ex- 

 panded. 



The copulatory bursa is rather thin walled, and with the penis is 

 capable of complete invagination. The penis sheath is relatively 

 short, and exhibits no muscular atrial enlargement at the upper end. 

 The glandular atrium is short, nearly spherical, and thick walled. 

 It receives the vasre deferentiie, which are of the usual form. In the 

 mounted specimen, from which figure 1 was drawn, the atrium was 

 twisted so that in the figure the anterior end is directed posteriorly. 



The common opening of the anterior pair of nephridia is located on 

 the doi"Sum of the major annulus of somite III, immediately pos- 

 terior to the dorsal appendage. 



The largest examples found among about a dozen specimens 

 measure about 1 mm. in length. 



This species was found on Cambarus acuminatu.% in the Johns 

 River, Watauga Co. , N. C. , in the summer of 1893; but what part 

 of the crayfish it inhabits was not determined, nor have cocoons 

 been found.

In form this species is similar to P. alcifoniK.t, but the head is 

 rather more robust, and the Vllth somite is of greater dianieter than 

 VI or VIII. 



Dorsal appendages are present on post-cephalic somites II to VIII 

 inclusive, and are much simpler than in /'. (ilriconniti. Tlie dorsal 

 ridges are not compressed and plate-like, and are similar on all the 

 somites. On somites II to VII each bears a pair of bluutly point(>d 

 cylindrical lateral a|)pendages, while somite VIII l)ears two paii-s; 

 they become somewhat larger anteriorly. 



These appendages contain no longitudinal muscle fibres, and the 




454 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



ridges on which they rest are largely formed, as shown in fig. 2b, of 

 a muscular network derived from the circular fibres. 



In somites VII and VIII a complete transverse loop is developed 

 on the intestine, which is otherwise as in P. alcicornus. The jaws are 

 also very similar, but differ in the shorter median pair of teeth, and 

 the stouter form of the basal plate. These distinctions are ex- 

 aggerated in the figures owing to the fact that they are represented 

 in slightly different positions, fig. 2a being somewhat foreshortened. 



The spermatheca is slender and clavate, and regularly tapers from 

 blind end to mouth. It lies to the left of the intestine. The cop- 

 ulatory bursa is nearly spherical, with thin muscular walls, and 

 larger bursal glands than P. alcicornus. Its inner surface is thrown 

 into deep ridges, among which the penis lies. The whole structure, 

 when evaginated is shaped not unlike a mushroom, and resembles the 

 corresponding parts of Bdellodrilus philadelphlcus. The glandular 

 atrium is remarkable in being divided by a deep cleft into two simi- 

 lar lobes, the structure being flattened in a plane perpendicular to 

 this cleft, giving the organ a shape much resembling the conven- 

 tionalized heart. The penis sheath is short, and lacks a sacular 

 dilation. 



The anterior nephridial pore is on the crest of the ridge of the 

 Ilird somite. In other respects this species resembles P. alcicornus. 



The largest example (from which the dissection fig. la was made) 

 from among upwards of fifty specimens measured 1.5 mm. in length, 

 the usual size being about 1 mm. 



Some small cocoons which may belong to this species were found 

 attached to the setse at the bases of the thoracic appendages of the 

 crayfishes from which the specimens were obtained. Unfortunately 

 the animals were not discovered while yet alive. 



P. distichus was found in great numbers with Bdellodrilus phila- 

 delphicus, B. vianxis n. s., and Branchiobdella instabilia upon speci- 

 mens of Cambarus bartonii, from western New York, for which I am 

 indebted to the kindness of Mr. Albert E. Lewis.

THE SADSBURY STEATITE. 

 BY THEODORE D. RAND. 



Under this name I purpose describing outcrops of steatitic rocks 

 most conspicuously exposed in West Sadsbury Township, Chester 

 County, Pa., in the adjoining township of Sadsbury, Lancaster Co., 

 and less so in Valley, West Cain and West Brandywine Town- 

 ships, Chester Co. These, though known to archa?ologists, seem to 

 have escaped the notice of geologists, though known locally and 

 made use of in the building of lime-kilns, and in the lining of iron 

 furnaces. Long anterior to this use, they were evidently of value 

 to the aborigines, whose tools are still to be found at the outcrops, 

 together with fragments of vessels manufactured by the Indians from 

 the steatite. 



My attention was directed to these exposures by j\Ir. Harry Wil- 

 son, of Gum Tree, Chester Co., who had visited the localities in the 

 study of archieology, and who kindly took me to the most prominent 

 outcrops. 



North of the Cambrian sandstone, which forms the mass of the 

 prominent North (Chester) Valley Hill, is a peculiar rock, often re- 

 sembling a pegmatite, often a very feldspathic gneiss or schist, occa- 

 sionally a hornblende or a mica schist. North of this is a very 

 heavy bedded, hard, highly crystalline gneiss, that recognized in 

 this portion of Pennsylvania as the most ancient gneiss, probably 

 of Laurentian age, identical with that of the Highlands of New 

 Jersey and with that of the ridge which extending southwestward 

 from near Trenton, N. J., to near Willow Grove, and there bifur- 

 cating, sends its southerly arm southwestward through ^lontgomery, 

 Delaware and Chester counties to North Brook, five miles southwest 

 of West Chester, and its northerly through northern Chester County, 

 where it widens greatly. It is this northerly arm which is referred to 

 above. In all its extent the rock is very compact and liard unless 

 decomposed, highly crystalline, rarely, if ever, schistose, except 

 from decomposition, and usually showing the characteristic blue 

 quartz. 




456 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



On the contrary, the rock next north of the Cambrian sandstone is 

 sometimes schistose, and while often gnesssic, is not nearly so densely 

 crystalline. The quartz is usually colorless or white. The rock 

 varies greatly, though the quartz — orthoclase variety, of coarse tex- 

 ture, is most abundant. While, as a whole, differing from any other 

 gneiss of southeastern Pennsylvania, it is more unlike the ancient 

 gneiss than it is unlike those southeast of the Trenton — North Brook 

 I'idge, that is the gneisses of Rogers' first belt, Mr. Hall's Phila- 

 delphia and Manayunk schists and gneisses. To the last, as a whole, 

 the resemblance is not close, but the rock of some strata in each beai' 

 a resemblance. It is the rock referred to by Dr. Frazer as "a rock 

 of doubtful signification called alternately conglomerate, feldspar 

 porphyry, etc." (C^ p. 221.) Although Dr. Frazer in his text 

 differentiates this rock,* on the map, it as well as the schists between 

 the Cambrian and the limestone are colored the same as the ancient 

 gneiss, though Dr. Frazer questions whether it is not really lower 

 Cambrian.^ 



At Valley Forge and eastward there is in the same relation to 

 the Cambrian sandstone a coarse conglomerate of pebbles chiefly of 

 bluish and pinkish quartz, which has been referred with little doubt 

 to the lower Cambrian. Could we be sure that this quartz feldspar 

 rock represents the conglomerate, a point would be gained, but inas- 

 much as they are extremely unlike, although exposed within five or 

 six miles of each other, I think we need proof of their identity. The 

 best exposure is along the west branch of the Brandy wine, north 

 of Coatesville, where they dip quite irregularly, but with a prevailing 

 southeast dip of 70° and upwards. 



As this rock resembles closely no other southeast of the red sand- 

 stone, and occurs, so far as I am aware, only in Chester County 

 and the adjoining county of Lancaster, I propose for it provisionally 

 the name of the Chester County gneiss. 



It is in this gneiss that most, if not all, of the outcrops of the 

 Sadsbury steatite occur, and apparently in two lines somewhat 

 irregular. 



The easternmost outcrop of the northerly line is on the farm of 

 Mr. Thomas H. Windle,' on the left bank of the West Branch of

the Brandyvviue, iu West Brandywine Township, about half a mile 

 K. ob° E. of Wagoutown. There are large, loose masses, some of 

 them of a schistose variety of the gneiss, containing apparently 

 hornblende and mica, and not soft, and others of similar appearance, 

 but soft enough to be cut readily with a knife, a steatite. No fast 

 rock was visible. To the north of it a hard, heavy bedded horn- 

 blende gneiss occurs. I was informed by Mr. Windle that consider- 

 able quantities of steatite have been obtained from this point, and 

 used iu the furnaces at Coatesville. 



The next locality is a half mile or less N. 75° W. of Wagontown, 

 or a little over three-fourths of a mile due west from the Windle 

 outcrop. These measurements and orientations are estimated from 

 the township map published by Breou, 1883, but a sighting of the 

 localities on the ground by compass (magnetic variation allowed for) 

 gave the direction N. 65 E. , an inexplicable difference of 25°. 

 This emphasizes the need of an accurate topographical map like 

 that of the New Jersey survey. 



This locality, on the farm of Abraham Brubaker, is immediately 

 north of the Lancaster road which passes through Wagontown (not 

 the Lancaster Pike, an approximatively parallel road a mile and a 

 half to the southward). An area of several acres of ploughed land 

 is strewn with numerous masses of steatite, mostly of small size, 

 while occasional fragments of basins and pots, and more rarely picks 

 made from trap rock give evidence that the red man had a work- 

 shop here. No rock certainly in place was seen in this field, but a 

 resident informed me that forty years ago a quarry of soapstone was 

 wrought at this place, out of which large blocks were taken for use 

 in furnaces. With the steatite are small masses of schistose gneiss, 

 also quartz, some of it containing tourmaline. In the steatite octa- 

 hedral crystals of magnetite occur rarely. 



On the westerly edge of this field is a ridge of loose sandstone 

 rock only fifteen or twenty feet wide, looking as if hauled and 

 dumped along a fence line, but the size of the slabs, and their simi- 

 lar orientation, showed that they had not been moved far, or by 

 other tjian natural forces. A few hundred feet to the westward there 

 appeared a high, steep ridge of Cambrian sandstone, precipitous 

 on its southern side. The rock at Hru baker's is evidently the eastern 

 termination of this ridge of sandstone, as it does not appear on thf 

 Brandywine in the line of strike. It apparently extends westward 




458 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OK [1894. 



to Compassville, being known farther west as Sandy Hill/ On the 

 north side of this ridge the highly crystalline, hard, older gneiss ap- 

 pears, and in it, as usual, considerable trap, an outcrop of which 

 appears about three- eighths of a mile north of the ridge, and about 

 a half mile north of West Cain Meeting-house. 



The next outcrop of the northern series is on the farm of William 

 Paxson on the Philadelphia and Lancaster turnpike in West Sads- 

 bury Township, near the northwest branch of the Octorara Creek. 

 It is very insignificant and poorly exposed. On the Breou map it is 

 five miles S. 70 W. from the Brubaker outcrop. 



The easternmost outcrop of the southerly line is also poorly ex- 

 posed and insignificant. It is in Valley Township on the farm of E. 

 S. Umstead, one mile N. 70 W. from Coatesville and about a mile 

 and a half nearly south of the Wiudle outcrop.' 



The next is also in Valley Township. It is on the farm of 

 William Hoofman, about a mile N. 45 E. of Pomeroy and two miles 

 S. 65 W. from the first. There is a large amount of the rock here 

 strew'U in fragments over the surface. One mass only was apparently 

 iu place, striking N. 65 E., the dip uncertain. Here cubic crystals 

 of probably limonite pseudoraorph after pyrite were found. The 

 steatite is in smaller masses, softer, and apparently more nearly ap- 

 proaching pure talc than at the other localities. 



The third is the most extensive of these outcrops. It is in West 

 Sadsbui-y Township, five miles S. 85 W. from the second, and a mile 

 and a half N. 7 W. from Atglen. Here, on the Strasburg road, is 

 the Swan Tavern. North of it the Chester County gneiss is' exposed^ 

 and beyond this, the steatite, a short distance south of the Swan 

 Public School. The steatite, here accompanied by chlorite and a very 

 compact rock of a dull bluish color, soft but very tough, is in great 

 quantity but wholly in loose masses. On the road to Atglen, south 

 of the schoolhouse, a white fine-grained, highly feldspathic gneiss dips 

 N. 80 E. 60° ; an anomalous dip if the rock is in place, as it appears 



♦ Tliis prominent sandstone hill is not shown on the map in C"*, though men- 

 tioned ill the text on page 262 (Wagonville being evidently a typographical error 

 for Wagontown) and on p. 20, where it is referred to as an eastern extension of 

 Copper Mine Ridge, though on p. 161 it is included in the gneiss area. 



^ This is in the area colored yellow on the map in V.*, where this color (repre- 

 senting the sandstone or quartzitc) is widened suddenly and greatly after an 

 equally great narrowing northwest and north of Coatesville. If the typical 

 Cambrian sandstone is indicated my observations would not agree with this 

 widening, while if the Chester ( 'ounty gneiss is intended to be included they would 

 not agree with the narrowing.

to be. Very close to this are two depressions out of which soapstone 

 is reported to have been quarried. Mr. Wilson informed me that 

 basins of Indian manufacture were found here in comparative 

 abundance. 



At the school a public road runs nearly east. Along this, on both 

 sides for a quarter of a mile, and then on the north side the steatitic 

 and serpentine rocks abound, but none were seen certainly in place. 

 With these was much gneissoid rock and rusty quartz, also in loose 

 masses. A mile east of this a large mass of steatite is visible in 

 the road, and I am informed that it occurs a half mile farther east 

 on the Limestone road, the dividing line between the townships of 

 Sadsbury and West Sadsbury." 



Between a quarter and a half mile north of the steatite the older 

 gneiss is visible in a road running north between two branches of the 

 Octorara. 



The fourth and westernmost of the southerly outcrops is the one 

 which has furnished probably the greatest variety - and number of 

 specimens of Indian handiwork, their quarries being still partially 

 visible. It is situated on the farm of Georize Williams, in Sadsbury 

 Township, Lancaster County, about one mile west of Christiana, 

 and three miles S. 70 W. from the Swan outcrop. The only ad- 

 jacent rock visible is a feldspathic gneiss of the Chester County 

 variety. This is shown in numerous loose masses in a line nearly 

 northeast from the steatite outcrop. The steatite is strewn in frag- 

 ments, some of them quite large, over an area of several acres, and 

 there are two places where quarries evidently existed but which have 

 been used as dumping grounds for the adjacent rock. In these, I am 

 informed, the rock in place was exposed. 



The steatite from all these localities is much alike, generally schis- 

 tose, quite soft, though impure and containing a large number of 

 small cavities as if from the weathering out of a contained mineral. 

 No crystalline form was observed in the cavities, they often contain 

 ferric oxide. The particles of talc are usually comparatively large 

 and irregular, making the rock, on a casual inspection, resemble a 

 mica schist more than the talc schists of the Lafayette steatite. The 

 color is usually dull gray, more rarely greenish. Except at the 

 Swan outcrop it is riot visibly accompanied by serpentine. At 



"< West Sadsbury was set oil" from Siidsbiiry in 1.H7H. Tlio dividing line is the 

 Limestone road, an old Indian trail and an iniimrtant hiKlnvay, which is the west 

 line of the boroutch of Parkesburg. 




460 PROCEKDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



Christiana it contains garnets, at Brubaker's magnetite, and at Hoof- 

 raan's altered pyrite. At Hoofman's, in small quantity, is a crypto- 

 crystalline variety, very soft, very pale green, nearly white in color, 

 and resembling the talc schist of Lafayette. At the Swan outcrop 

 chlorite in large folia occurs, also a rock apparently one of the 

 hornblende family changing into steatite or chlorite. 



At the Windle outcrop the masses of steatite so closely resemble 

 the adjacent masses of schistose gneiss that one is in doubt until he 

 tests for hardness, and there appears to be a gradation from the very 

 hard to the very soft rock. 



I have stated that these outcrops are in the Chester County 

 gneiss, but to this the William Paxson outcrop may be an exception. 

 There is an outcrop of the ancient gneiss to the southwest of it. 

 The exposures do not suiEce to indicate much more than its certain 

 existence. 



There is one other outcrop of steatite to which my attention was 

 called by Mr. Windle, further north than any of those already 

 mentioned and apparently isolated. It is on the farm of Samuel 

 Holmes, and on the south branch of Birch Run, an affluent of the 

 west branch of the Brandywine, in West Cain Township, Chester 

 Co. , and is in the course of the ancient gneiss, which ranges north of 

 the sandstone, north of the Chester County gneiss, in West Cain. As 

 usual the exposure is poor, consisting of but a few loose masses of 

 steatite, with masses of schistose gneiss resembling it in appearance. 

 Perhaps the most striking feature at all these outcrops, considered 

 in relation to those on the southerly side of the valley is the rarity 

 of serpentine. At all other steatite outcrops in S. E. Pennsylvania 

 of which I have knowledge serpentine rocks abound, and the steatite 

 rocks are subordinate, except perhaps in the Lafayette steatite belt, 

 but in it serpentine is abundant though the steatite predominates. 

 In these outcrops north of the valley, however, serpentine is quite 

 rare, bemg found at the Swan outcrop only. The resemblance of 

 the steatite to the gneiss found with it is very similar to the occur- 

 rence at Chestnut Hill, north of Easton, Pa.,* and my observations 

 lead me to the conclusion that the genesis is the same in both in- 

 stances, the alteration of a gneiss containing probably a large pro- 

 portion of a magnesian mica, and this perhaps derived from the 

 hornblende, as is certainly the case on the Schuylkill, above Girard 

 Avenue Bridge, Fairmount Park, Philadelphia.

The following tinnual reports were read and referred to the Pub- 

 lication Committee : — 



REPORT OF THE RECORDING SECRETARY. 



The interest in the meetings of the Academy has been well sustained 

 during the past year, and the work of the Publication Committee, the re- 

 port of which it is customary to include in that of the Recording Secre- 

 tary, has been of more than the usual importance. The attendance at 

 the meetings has averaged thirty-six. Verbal communications have 

 been made by Messrs. Sharp, Ryder, Dixon, Libbey, Chapman, Cope, 

 Willcox, Wistar, Pilsbry, Holman, Goldsmith, Rand, Mercer, 

 Brinton, Allen, Heilprin, Woolman, A. E. Brown, Ball, Sangree, 

 Eakius, Morsell, McCook, Wilson, Rhoads, Morris, Johnson, Rex, 

 and McFarlane. Such of these con)munications as have been re- 

 ported by their authors have been published in the Proceedings. 



During the year 192 pages of the Proceedings for 1893 and 376 

 for 1894, illustrated by 13 plates have been published. The first 

 and second numbers of the tenth volume of the Journal, composed 

 of two elaborate memoirs by Clarence B. Moore on the sand mounds 

 of Florida, and consisting of 246 pages and 33 plates, have also 

 been issued and distributed. Material is now in the hands of the 

 Publication Committee for the completion of the ninth volume, which 

 has been delayed in consequence of the character of Mr. Moore's 

 papers, and it is hoped that the last number will be distributed to 

 subscril)ers and correspondents early in the spring. There will 

 then remain in the hands of the Committee for the continuation of 

 the tenth volume a memoir on the development of the brain in the 

 Anthropoids, by the late Dr. Andrew J. Parker, and one on the crania 

 of the Sand Mounds of Florida, by Dr. Harrison Allen, the latter 

 to be elaborately illustrated through tlie liberality of Mr. Clarence 

 B. Moore, to whom the Academy is also indebted for the tine plates- 

 accompanying his own com mun Nations. 



The Manual of Conchology has been continued by the (x)nchologi- 

 cal Sect-ion, 482 pages and 79 plates having been published in the 

 two series of which the work consists, while 340 pages and 10 plates 

 of the Entomological News and 344 pages and 8 plates of the Trans- 

 actions of the American Entomological Society have been issued by 

 the Entomological Section.

 The deaths of thirteen members and five correspondents have been 

 announced. Nine resignations of membership have been presented 

 and accepted. 



Mr. Gavin W. Hart having resigned his position in the Council of 

 the Academy, Dr. C. N. Peirce was elected to fill the vacancy 

 April 3d. 



The By-Laws were amended February 27th, by the addition of 

 the following words to Article XIII, of Chapter 5 : "Should any Sec- 

 tion be dissolved, become extinct, or cease to exist for any cause 

 whatever, all the property and effects of such Section shall be held 

 by the Academy for its own use in such of its departments as it may 

 deem most appropriate, preferring those nearest related to the objects 

 of such Section, except such property or parts thereof as may be 

 subject to conditions or limitations by deed, devise, bequest, or special 

 agreement, in which case such property shall be disposed of in ac- 

 cordance with such condition, limitation, or agreement. " 



On the report of the Committee on the Hayden Geological 

 Memorial Award the medal and accumulated interest on the fund 

 have this year been voted to Prof. Gabriel Auguste Daubree of the 

 Institut de France. 



By permission of the Academy meetings have been held on the 

 premises during the year by the Geographical Club, the Botanical 

 Club, the Delaware Valley Ornithological Club, Pennsylvania 

 Society for the Prevention of Tuberculosis, Pennsylvania Forestry 

 Association, Woods Holl Biological Association, and the United 

 States Veterinary Medical Association.

In addition to these, 127 works having no relation to science have 

 been received and catalogued for future disposition by the Library 

 Committee. 



The increase in the number of accessions is due to replies received 

 to 258 applications for deficiencies and 62 propositions for exchange 

 of publications. The latter included letters written to all the 

 scientific societies and journals not yet on the Academy's exchange 

 list, the names of which could be ascertained. The results of the 

 correspondence have been encouraging. 



The binding has been confined almost entirely to the department 

 of journals and periodicals, 408 volumes having been bound during the 

 year, while 86 volumes are now in tlio hands of the workmen. Much 

 still remains to I)c accomplished, although tlie good results of the last 

 two years' comparatively liberal appropriations for binding are 

 31 




466 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



evident. The volumes are always carefully collated in the Academy 

 before being sent out of the building. The work was interrupted 

 during the summer in consequence of the Librarian's absence in 

 Europe. He took occasion to visit such libraries of scientific societies 

 as could be reached in the cities visited, and is glad to be able to 

 state that no library devoted purely to natural history seen by him was 

 superior either in extent or in convenience of arrangement to that of 

 the Academy. 



Perhaps the most important bibliographical aid to the scientific 

 student is the Royal Society Catalogue of Scientific Papers. The ten 

 volumes now issued embrace an alphabetical arrangement of authors 

 with the titles of their contributions from 1800 to 1883. It has long 

 been felt that a catalogue of these papers arranged according to sub- 

 ject was a most important desideratum, but one which must necessarily 

 be the work of co-operation among the scientific societies and biblio- 

 graphers of the world. Attention was called to the desirability of 

 such a compilation in the report of the Librarian of the Academy 

 for 1889, and it is, therefore, now a cause of congratulation that the 

 subject is under consideration by the Royal Society of London. 



A circular having been received from the Society asking for co- 

 operation and suggestion, a committee was appointed consisting of 

 Messrs. Philip P. Calvert, Henry Pilsbry, Stewardson Brown, Ben- 

 jamin Sharp and Theodore D. Rand, with the Librarian as Chair- 

 man, to which the document was referred. A report was adopted by 

 the Academy to the effect: — 



1. That a catalogue of scientific papers as proposed by the Royal 

 Sqciety is desirable and that international co-operation should be en- 

 gaged in its preparation. 



2. That in order to secure uniformity in all parts of such a 

 catalogue, a central bureau, as suggested by the Committee of the 

 Royal Society, appears to be necessary, rather than that separate 

 portions of the catalogue should be prepared by various institutions, 

 such central bureau to be under the direction of the Royal Society, 

 from which the proposition emanates; all publications of societies 

 and monographs to be sent to such central bureau ; the expenses to 

 be met by returns from the sale of copies of the catalogue. 



3. That such a catalogue should be classified and should be 

 issued at least once a year, each volume to be provided with an 

 alphabetical index. 




1894.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 467 



4. That the scope of such a classified catalogue should embrace 

 the various yearly bibliographies of special sciences now issued. 



5. That whenever translations or summaries are believed to be 

 desirable, English should be made the basis of the catalogue. 



The Academy is indebted to George Vaux, Mary M. Vaux, 

 George Vaux, Jr., and Wm. S. Vaux, Jr., for a fine portrait in oil 

 of the late Wm. S. Vaux, whose long connection with the Academy 

 as Curator, Vice-President, and member of various executive com- 

 mittees for over forty years, together with his permanent association 

 with the mineralogical and archisological departments of the Museum, 

 of which the Wm. S. Vaux Collections form an important part, 

 renders this memorial of unusual interest. 



Special acknowledgment is due to Mr. Wm. J. Fox for his 

 efficient and faithful discharge of the duties of the office during the 

 Librarian's absence. Means were again provided by friends of the 

 Academy for the employment during the summer months of Signer 

 Emauuele Frouani, much of whose time was devoted to the correspon- 

 dence regarding deficiencies and exchanges. 



All of which is respectfully submitted.

REPORT OF THE CURATORS. 



The Curators report that the museum, so far as regards the preser- 

 vation of the specimens, is in the satisfactory condition descrilied in 

 their last annual report, while important progress has been made 

 during the year in the rearrangement, marking, and cataloguing of 

 the collections. 



It is also a satisfaction to report the completion of the new museum 

 building and the transference of some of the collections to the new 

 galleries. 



It was deemed most desirable to devote the first floor of the new 

 museum to the departments of Archieology and Mineralogy, and in 

 accordance with this plan the entire Vaux collection, iiuiiil)ering 33 

 cases, has been transferred under the direction of the Curators and 

 Mr. W. W. Jefferi.s, the special curator of this collection. Mr. 

 Jefferis has given many valuable minerals to this great collection 

 during the year ; and thanks to his untiring energy the entire cabinet 




468 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEJIY OF [1894. 



is now in systematic order. The arrangement of the specimens in the 

 Vaux archaeological collection will also soon be completed. 



]Mr. Clarence B. Moore generously presented six handsome ex- 

 hibition cases made under the direction of the Curators for the Moore 

 collection of Indian pottery and mound relics from Florida, which 

 have been placed in the new building next to the Vaux collection. 

 Mr. Moore has personally superintended the transference and 

 arrangement of his specimens, which now constitute probably the 

 most valuable archaeological series from this region in existence. 



The Academy has also purchased four additional cases like those 

 in which the Moore collection is placed, and in these have been 

 arranged the celebrated Poinsett collection of Mexican antiquities 

 deposited by the American Philosophical Society, and the Haldeman 

 Indian collection. In addition to these the cases of Eskimo imple- 

 ments and clothing have been removed to the new building, and 

 numerous spears, shields, kyaks, and canoes have been placed in 

 position on the walls and pillars. In a short time the remainder of 

 the archaeological material will be removed to the new building. 

 This floor will then be ready for exhibition. 



The archaeological department of the museum, as finally arranged, 

 will form one of the finest exhibits in the country, being only 

 surpassed in value by those at Cambridge and Washington. Con- 

 taining as it does many unique specimens, this department, which 

 for lack of space has been so long neglected, will now be placed in 

 good condition. The Academy's cabinet of minerals will be trans- 

 ferred as soon as suitable cases can be secured. It will be arranged 

 contiguous to the Vaux collection of minerals. 



In addition to the transference of these collections to the new 

 building an important rearrangement has been effected in the old 

 museum. Nine cases have been removed to the room over the 

 Lecture Hall, which has been set apart to illustrate the natural 

 history of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The mammals of these 

 States have been selected from the general collection and many new 

 specimens have been especially prepared for it, while the Delaware 

 Valley Ornithological Club's collection of birds, with nests and eggs 

 mounted to show their life history, has been removed from the orni- 

 thological gallery and arranged here to much better advantage. A 

 local collection of reptiles and mollusks has been presented by 

 Messrs. Brown and Stone, while a series of the local lepidoptera is 




1894.] NATURAL, SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 469 



being prepared for presentation by Dr. Henry Skinner, so that there 

 will soon be an exhibit of the natural history of Pennsylvania and 

 New Jersey much more complete than has heretofore been displayed, 

 and which will constitute a representative State Museum. 



Among other work accomplished during the year may be men- 

 tioned the rearrangement of the mammalian osteological collection, 

 many of the disarticulated skeletons being placed in drawers where 

 they are more available for study. 



The large amount of unclassified paheontological material stored 

 in drawers on the main floor has also been re-examined, roughly 

 classified and labeled, thus greatly facilitating the final disposition of 

 the material. 



In cataloguing the museum, important progress has been made, 

 especially in the department of birds, where 5,907 specimens have 

 been carefully examined, identified and catalogued, the types and 

 duplicates unnecessary for display being removed from the stands and 

 placed in cabinets, those desirable for exhibition being remounted. 

 In this work the Curators have followed the practice adopted in all 

 other large museums, and endorsed by letters from the leading 

 ornithologists of the world. A more detailed account of the work 

 of the ornithological department will be found in the report of the 

 Section. 



The collection of reptiles and batrachians, numbering 3,939 jars, 

 has also been carefully examined during the year, the jars numbered 

 and a rough catalogue prepared. The entries, however, have not 

 yet been copied into the regular catalogue pending a revision of the 

 identifications. 



In the mineralogical department, through the valuable assistance 

 of Mr. J. E. Richardson, the entire collection of over 8,000 speci- 

 mens has been permanently numbered with painted figures and a 

 considerable portion catalogued. The importance of this work can- 

 not be overestimated, as it will, when completed, preclude all possi- 

 bility of loss of data by the misplacing of specimens. 



The department of invertebrate pahcontology has profited by the 

 liberality of the Rev. Dr. L. T. Chamberlain, who has provided a 

 handsome mahogany case for the display of the Isaac Lea collection, 

 and has sent an expedition to the fossil-bearing beds of the Southern 

 States. A rich collection, numbering over 500 species, has been 

 secured, and is now being unpacked and cla.ssified. Dr. Chamber- 




470 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894- 



lain has also generously provided cases for the valuable slabs of 

 fossil foot prints presented by Isaac Lea. During the year Dr. 

 Chamberlain was appointed special conservator of the eocene fossils. 



The remainder of the Pennsylvania State Geological Survey col- 

 lection is also being unpacked and arranged so that all the material 

 will soon be available for study. 



During the latter part of last year Dr. Benj. Sharp, in conjunction 

 with Prof Wm. Libby, Jr., conducted an important expedition to 

 the Hawaiian Islands. As he returned too late to prepare his col- 

 lections for presentation in time for the last annual report, no men- 

 tion of them was made at that time. During the past year these 

 collections have been arranged in the museum where they form a 

 valuable addition, comprising many archaeological specimens of in- 

 terest, as well as a fine series of volcanic rocks and lavas, and a 

 series of dried plants. 



The Academy's taxidermist, ]Mr. D. N. McCadden, besides spend- 

 ing much time during the year in remounting the birds, has prepared 

 a large number of new specimens, mainly received in th^ flesh from 

 the Zoological Society of Philadelphia. These have been mounted for 

 the museum or converted into skins or skeletons as the circumstances 

 warranted. 



The accessions during the year have been of great importance. 

 Besides the gifts already mentioned, the Martiudale collection of 

 lepidoptera, comprising appoximately 16,000 specimens, was pur- 

 chased by the Academy with the assistance of a number of generous 

 contributors, and this, together with the Peale and other collections 

 already in its possession, places the Academy in the front rank in 

 this department. 



Mr. Clarence B. Moore has continually added to his collection of 

 Indian mound relics, and has had collectors at work in Ohio and 

 Florida during the year. The Zoological Society of Philadelphia 

 presented numerous valuable specimens of mammals and birds, 

 while the Delaware Valley Ornithological Club has added numerous 

 groups to the special collection of local birds and nests. 



An important collection of post pliocene fossils has been obtained 

 by Dr. S. G. Dixon and Mr. H. C. Mercer from a fissure in the 

 limestone rocks at Port Kennedy, Pa., where they have made exca- 

 vations and collected a large amount of valuable data. So far spe- 

 cimens of Megalonyx, Mastodon, Tapir, Peccary, Deer, etc., have 




1{^94. ] NATUKAL, SCIENCES OF PHIT.ADEI^i'HIA. 471 



been obtained, full accounts of which will be published in the near 

 future. 



The museum during the year has furnished aid to many specialists 

 who have been offered every facility within the power of the Curators, 

 while the interest of the general public in the exhibits would appear 

 to be greatly stimulated. This is largely due to the custom inaugu- 

 rated during the past year, of placing new and attractive specimens 

 in a prominent place on the main floor of the museum for some days 

 before putting them in their final positions, as well as to many popu- 

 lar articles which have appeared in our daily papers. 



Specimens have been loaned during the year to Mr. T. Wayland 

 Vaughan, Dr. Wra. H. Dall, Austin C. Apgar, B. W. Everraann, 

 Prof. Jas. Hall, Messrs. F. W. True, F. M. Chapman, C. W. Rich- 

 mond, and Dr. Geo. Bauer. 



The departments of botany and entomology have been under the 

 care of the special conservators, Mr. John H. Redfield and Dr. Henry 

 Skinner respectively, to whom the Curators are indebted for their 

 valuable aid. Acknowledgment is also due to Mr. W. W. Jefieris, 

 Curator of the Vaux Collections, and Messrs. Shultz, Boyer, and 

 Woolman who have done valuable work in classifying and labeling 

 the collection of diatoms. 



The unusual progress thus recorded is largely owing to the earnest- 

 ness and fidelity manifested by the assistants, Messrs. Witmer Stone 

 and Samuel N. Rhoads, Mr. D. N. McCadden, taxidermist, and the 

 Jessup Fund students, Messrs. J. E. Richardson, Howard Y. Pcn- 

 nell and Henry W. Fowler.

REPORT OF BIOLOGICAL AND MICROSCOPICAL 

 SECTION. 



During the year nine regular meetings of the Section have been 

 held, at which coinnninications were made and microscopic slides 

 exhibited. 



Among the communications of special interest were those of Dr. 

 B. Sharp, on his expedition to Hawaii and on the fi'itilizatiou of 




472 PKOCEKDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



plants ; those of Dr. Geo. A. Rex, on bacteria in the Myxomycetes ; 

 of Mr. Amos P. Brown, on hairs on Mentzelia, and Mr. Boyer's 

 description of a new form of diatom, named by him Rhahdonema 

 Woohnanii. 



At the joint meetings with the Academy the Section has always 

 been represented by its members, and important communications 

 have been made as follows : John A. Ryder, preparation of nervous 

 tissue, formation of brain convolutions; Geo. A. Rex, M. D. , plas- 

 modiura of Myxomycetes, Diachoea Thomasii ; Benjamin Sharp, 

 PhD., curious growth on a tree-root from San Salvador, fertiliza- 

 tion of plants in Hawaii; C. S. Boyer, on cyclosis ; Lewis Woolmau, 

 remarks on diatoms; S. G. Dixon, M. D. , protection from tubercu- 

 losis; D. S. Holman, remarks on Myxomycetes; S. Trenner, exhibi- 

 tion of centrifugal machine; M. V. Ball, M. D. , remarks on tetanus 

 and the antitoxin, crystals formed by bacteria, skulls of criminals. 



The donations to the collection have been few : One slide of 

 barking sand, by Dr. Rex, and ten slides of histologic subjects by Mr. 

 Leedom Sharp. 



Five new names have been added to the list of members and con- 

 tributors. One death has been announced, and two members have 

 resigned, leaving the number of members and contributors sixty- four. 



The average attendance at the regular meetings was eight. 



The Treasurer's report shows a balance of S239.39 in the 

 treasury. 



Dr. Geo. A. Rex, the Conservator of the Section, reports as fol- 

 lows: — 



The property of the Section is in good condition. The microscopes 

 and accessory apparatus are in working order and have been freely 

 and frequently used at the stated meeting of the Section. 



No addition has been made to the apparatus during the year. 

 The slide collection is also in good order, but it is to be regretted 

 that but few additions have been made since the last report. 



Some inconvenience results from the crowded condition of our 

 cabinet, especially in the space devoted to the large binoculars an<l 

 the Leidy stands, but it is hoped that this will be remedied when 

 space in the new building is available.

REPORT OF THE CONCHOLOGICAL SECTION. 



During the year 1894 specimens of mollusca have been re- 

 •ceived from 45 persons, and a large number of species new to the 

 collection have been added to the museum, as well as a few new to 

 science. As usual, a great many specimens illustrating geographic 

 distribution and variation have increased the study series; and as 

 the growth of this series, which is arranged in drawers under the ex- 

 hibition cases, exceeds the growth of the exhibition series, we are 

 again in urgent need of space for its proper disposal. 



The principal accessions during the year have been several send- 

 ings from Dr. J. C. Cox of shells from Australia and Tasmania, a 

 large series of marine shells of Japan which we have been allowed to 

 select from the collection of Mr. Frederick Stearns, a series of 

 Japanese land mollusks in alcohol, and a very valuable collection of 

 shells from the Liukiu Is., also due to the liberality of Mr. Stearns. 

 A considerable number of South Australian land shells and chitons 

 we owe to Mr. W. T. Bednall. Finally, the Conservator, witli the 

 co-operation of Mr. C. W. Johnson, was enabled to collect very ex- 

 tensive series of the mollusks of the middle St. Johns River, FU)rida. 

 Many thousand specimens were collected from numerous localitie.n 

 and the jnaterial amas.sed will prove of great importance in the study 

 of the variable and ill-defined species? of Floridian Uni(mi(]a'. An 

 especial object of the journey was to procure certain pecidiar local 

 races of VIvipara ; and a nunit)er of varieties new to science were 

 found, including one of the most divergent forms of the genus yet 




474 PKOCEEDIXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



discovered in any country, which adds an entirely new phase to the 

 series of variations known in the family Viviparidse. The success 

 of these researches is attributable to the excellent facilities placed at 

 our disposal by Mr. Clarence B. Moore. 



Accessions to our series of American shells have been received 

 from Messrs. A. G. Wetherby, E. G. Vanatta, ^lorris Schick, H. 

 F. Stupakoff, H. E. Sargent, C. W. Johnson, O. A. Nylander, S. 

 N. Rhoads, W. J. Raymond, and numerous others, whose names 

 appear in the list of accessions to the museum. A collection of 

 New Jersey shells has been made and presented by Messrs. Witmer 

 Stone, S. and F. H. Brown. It is now arranged in the Pennsyl- 

 vania and New Jersey department of the museum. 



From Prof. H. W. Gwatkiu, of Cambridge, England, we have 

 received a large number of mounted radulse of mollusks, in ex- 

 change for material for mounting. 



Mr. H. Suter and Prof F. W. Hutton, of New Zealand, and 

 Mr. C. Hedley, of Sydney, New South Wales, have continued dur- 

 ing the year to send us new and rare forms of antipodal mollusks. 

 A series of Sandwich Island forms, collected by Dr. B. Sharp, has 

 added several rare or new species. 



Except in the proper placing of new material in the cases, and the 

 detemaination of new and old material, but little work has been 

 done in the museum dui'ing the year; this has been owing partly to 

 the pressure of other work, but mainly to the fact that little can be 

 done advantageously until more space is allotted to the Conchological 

 department. It is believed that this will be accomplished during the 

 coming year.

REPORT OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SECTION. 

 The regular monthly meetings have been held during the year, 

 except in July and August. The average attendance of members 

 at meetings has been ten persons. Interesting verbal communications 

 on entomological subjects have been made by nearly all the mem- 

 bers and associates. The publication known as the Entomological 

 News and Proceedings of the Entomological Section of the Academy 

 of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, has been continued, and

REPORT OF THE BOTANICAL SECTION. 



The Botanical Section respectfully reports that it is in a prosper- 

 ous condition, has held regular monthly meetings at which valuable 

 communications have been presented and discussed, and that it is 

 wholly free from debt. 



The herbarium, owing to the assiduous labors of the Conservator, 

 Mr. John H. Redfield, is in a highly prosperous condition, contain- 

 ing about 33,000 species of flowering plants and ferns, of which 452 

 new to the herbarium were added last year. 



The herbarium is hampered by want of room, all of which is set 

 forth in detail in the Conservator's annual statement, wliich is ap- 

 pended as part of this report. 



The officers elected for the ensuing year are: — 



Director,

The Conservator of the Botanical Section reports as follows: — 

 This is the nineteenth year .since a change of the By-Laws of the 




476 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



Academy placed the care of its herbarium with the Conservator 

 chosen by the newly formed Botanical Section, instead of with a 

 committee chosen by the Academy as formerly. Certainly the con- 

 tinued and rapid growth of the collection and the improvement of 

 its condition during that period have not been excelled in any por- 

 tion of the Academy's earlier history. Those who remember the 

 narrow, dark, and cramped accommodations afforded the botanical 

 collections in the old Broad Street building, and the uuwieldly port- 

 folios in which they were arranged, under the old Linmean system, 

 can now congratulate the working botanists upon the improvement in 

 the accessibility and usefulness of the herbarium which resulted 

 from the change of quarters and from more modern methods of ar- 

 rangement. At the time of that removal, the estimates of the ex- 

 tent of the collection were vague and exaggerated. The careful and 

 conservative enumeration which has since been made of the flower- 

 ing plants and ferns, places the number of species at the present 

 time at over 33,000. If we add to these the cryptogamic collections, 

 which have not been so carefully enumerated, the total would 

 probably appi'oach 40,000 species. Nearly one-half of these have 

 been received since we have been in the present quarters. But the 

 number of new species received gives a very inadequate idea of the 

 growth, a large part of which consists of additions of species pre- 

 viously represented, but now in fuller suites from new and wider 

 localities, and in better condition. 



The collections removed from the old building were all in loose 

 sheets or species- covers, and had consequently suffered much in 

 handling, from the brittleness of age ; and many of the subsequent 

 additions were necessarily placed in the same way. But soon after 

 the removal it was determined that it was all-important that the 

 whole should be properly and permanently affixed to sheets with 

 collector's tickets securely preserved. The task was a great one, 

 with the little help at command, but it has been steadily pursued 

 during the time not required for the care of now accessions. The 

 separate North American collection is all thus mounted, and about 

 one-fourth of the larger general herbarium. 



The number of plants received during the past year reaches 2,119 

 species, of which 204 belong to the lower cryptogams and 1,915 are 

 phanerogams and ferns. Of the latter 489 are N. American species, 

 311 Tropical American, 191 European, 684 Asiatic, 150 African, 




1<S94. ] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 477 



and 90 Australian and Polynesian. 452 of these are new to our 

 collection, and 30 of them repi'eseut new genera. 



It is hoped that tlie additional space soon to be at command of the 

 Academy will enable the Curators to provide some means for the 

 expansion of the botanical collections. When we took possession of 

 the present cases, large room was left for growth, but nineteen years 

 have crowded the shelves to the point of injury to the contents. If 

 the present shelf room were doubled there would still be very 

 moderate space for that future increase of the herbarium which may 

 be reasonably expected. 



The present cases, though so much in advance of previous accom- 

 modation do not afford adequate protection from dust, and should be 

 fitted with dust-tight doors, and all new cases should be of the best 

 dust-proof construction.

REPORT OF THE MINERALOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL 



SECTION. 



Meetings of the Section have been held regularly during the year 

 except during the summer months. The attendance has not been 

 large, but this has been due, in great part, to illness and absence 

 from the city of several active members. There has been no lack 

 of interest. The additions to the museum have been satisfactory. 



It is hoped that in the new building space and cases may be pro- 

 vided for a display of the minerals and rocks of the vicinity of our 

 city, for it is believed that the present small and poor local collec- 

 tion could easily be increased so as to be a most valuai)le and in- 

 teresting feature of the museum. 



The following officers have been elected for the ensuing year: — 



Director, ..... Theodore 1). Rand.

REPORT OF THE ORNITHOLOGICAL SECTION. 



The Section is pleased to report that the Ornithological Department 

 of the Museum is in excellent condition as regards the preservation of 

 the specimens, and to note important progress in the work of reno- 

 vating the collection on the plans outlined in a previous report. 



The question having arisen as to the policy of remounting the 

 type specimens and duplicates unnecessary for display, as has been 

 the custom during the ptist two years, the Conservator consulted 

 several of the leading ornithologists of the Avorld and obtained their 

 unqualified endorsement of the plans for the renovation of the collec- 

 tion recommended by the Section and adopted by the Curators. 



In view of the endorsement of R. Bowdler Sharpe, Robert Ridg- 

 way, and other high authorities we feel fully justified in the course 

 we have pursued and are convinced that the proper preservation of 

 our collection of birds is absolutely dependent upon the continuance 

 of the treatment that we have already outlined. 



Owing to the rniscellaneous duties of the Conservator in his posi- 

 tion as Assistant to the Board of Curators, his work on the ornitho- 

 logical collection was mainly restricted to the summer mouths. At 

 this time, also, the Academy's taxidermist, JNIr. David N. McCad- 

 den, was enabled to devote his entire time to this department, and 

 with the further valuable assistance of Messrs. Howard Y. Pennell 

 and Henry ^Y. Fowler, it was possible to make greater progress with 

 the work of renovation than in any previous year. 



In all 5,907 mounted specimens were examined, catalogued, and 

 labelled, and then remounted or reduced to skins as the circum- 

 stances warranted. These included the Ciconiidse, Gruidse, Limicolse, 

 Gallinte, Columbse, Dendrocolaptidie, Formicariidse, Paridse, Buce- 

 rotidie, and part of the Fringillidse. In addition specimens of the 

 Corvidje, Paradisseidse, Icteridae, and Tanagridse which had pre- 

 viously been catalogued were remounted for exhibition. Several 

 temporary lists were also copied into the regular catalogue during 

 the year aggregating 7,029 entries, while all the accessions have 

 been labelled and placed in the proper places. The entire study 

 series of American birds has been carefully examined and found to 

 be in excellent condition. 



The principal accessions during the year have been small collec- 

 tions from Lower California, California, and Florida, received in 




1894.] NATURAI. SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 479 



exchange or by purchase, and also numerous specimens from the 

 Zoological Society of Philadelphia, among which may be mentioned 

 specimens of Struthio mohjbdophanes and Dromius irroratus. 



The Delaware Valley Ornithological Club has added many 

 attractive groups to the collection of Pennsylvania and New Jersey 

 birds which is rapidly approaching completion. 



At the annual meeting of the Section held December 17, 1894, 

 the following^ officers were elected: — 



Director, ..... Dr. Spencer Trotter. 



Vice- Director, .... Geo. S. Mojris. 



Recorder, ..... Stewardson Brown.

REPORT OF THE PROFESSOR OF INVERTEBRATE 

 PALEONTOLOGY. 



The Professor of Invertebrate Paleontology respectfully reports 

 that, as heretofore, he has delivered his regular spring courses 

 of lectures, twenty-five in number, the attendance at which has been 

 larger than in any previous year. These lectures, end)racing in great 

 part the physiographic features of the region about Philadelphia, 

 were supplemented by weekly field parties, and by two special sum- 

 mer class excursions: one to the region of the Shawangunk and 

 Delaware Mountains, the other to the Bermuda Islands. On the 

 first of tliese excursions the methods of topographical surveying were 

 practically demonstrated in addition to the regular work in geology 

 and paleontology. Two new fossil-l)earing localities in the Trias 

 were discovei'ed in the course of the spring excursions. 



The , collections in the department of Invertebrate Paleontology 

 have not been materially augmented during the year, nor has (heir 

 condition been very greatly changed. Much has been done to- 

 ward determining and redetermining unidontilied or doubtful form.«, 

 and from many specimens hitherto unofficially lai)clled — i.e., not 




480 PROCEKDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



named by the author of the species in question — the labels have 

 been removed. In a few cases, too, the authors' labels were found 

 to be incorrect, or at least so doubtful as to necessitate the affixing ot 

 an interrogation mark to the identification. The general changes 

 that had been made on the floor of the museum broke into the con- 

 tinuity of the arrangement that formerly existed, and necessitated a 

 considerable reversal in the disposition of the series. An almost full 

 readjustment has been made for the time being, but it -cannot be said 

 to meet the actual requirements of the collection. Very nearly 

 double the case-room that the collection now occupies is needed for a 

 proper display of, and to meet additions to, the American fossils 

 alone, and the European collection, which is very disadvantageously 

 stored away in drawers, would occupy about as much space as the 

 American collection occupies at the present time. It is hoped that 

 with the occupation of the Academy's new building the proper relief 

 will be afforded this department. 



The additions to the collection during the year are included in 

 the list of accessions to the museum. 



Respectfully submitted, 



Angelo Heilprin, 

 Prof, of Invertehrate Paleontology. 



REPORT OF THE PROFESSOR OF ETHNOLOGY AND 

 ARCHEOLOGY. 



I have to report that in the early months of the year I delivered 

 a course of lectures on general archaeology. They were six in num- 

 ber and were free to the public. The attendance was unusually 

 large, and a general interest was manifested in the subject. 



The collections in this department have been increased by valuable 

 accessions, which will be specified in the reports of the Curators. 

 The whole collection is now in process of rearrangement in a favor- 

 able location in the new building.

 Professor of Etlinology and Archaeology.

REPORT OF THE PROFESSOR OF LOWER INVER- 

 TEBRATA. 



The Professor of Lower Invertebrata, respectfully reports that 

 during the past year he has delivered lectures on the results of the 

 Hawaiian Expedition. 



The additions to the museum during the year have been neither 

 numerous nor important. 



Work has been carried on in the carcinological department in re- 

 labelling and rearranging specimens. With the help of Dr. A. 

 Ortraann, the Porcellanidte have been correctly determined and re- 

 labelled. 



A course of lectures, ten in number, is planned to be delivered 

 sometime during the spring on general zoology.

 Professor of Loive'r Invertebrata. 



REPORT OF THE PROFESSOR OF HISTOLOGY AND 

 MICROSCOPIC TECHNOLOGY. 



The Professor of Histology and Microscopic Technology respect- 

 fully reports that he has conducted less than the usual work in the 

 bacteriological laboratory than in past years, owing to the fact that 

 the greater part of his time has been devoted to his duties as Execu- 

 tive Curator. Some satisfactory work, however, has been accom- 

 plished in bacteriological examinations of drinking waters in the 

 State of Pennsylvania, and in continued investigations upon the 

 various lines heretofore suggested for the prevention and cure of 

 tuberculosis and other germ diseases. 



Original investigations made during the winter on the relation- 

 ship between Tuberculosis and Nitrogenous Metabolism have been 

 communicated to the Academy and published in the Therapeutic 

 Gazette for December 15, 1894. 



Microscopic examinations have been made of the viscera of 

 animals which have died at the Philadelphia Zoological Gardens. 



The bacteriological laboratory has been freely used by members of 

 the Academy who desired the privilege, while the society has not 

 32 




4(S2 PKOCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1894. 



been called upou directly or indirectly to defray the expenses incurred 

 for equipment or maintenance. 



Instruction has been given in the use of the microscope, but no 

 work has been done in histology. 



Samuel G. Dixon, 

 Prof, of Histology and Microscopic Technology. 



REPORT OF THE CURATOR OF THE WM. S. YAUX 

 COLLECTIONS. 



The Curator of the Wni. S. Vaux Collections respectfully reports 

 that the cabinets have been in good condition during the past year. 

 They have, however, been inspected by but few persons, owing to the 

 unfavorable situation of the rooms in which they were arranged. 

 No additions have been made in the arch^ological section since the 

 donor's death. At the present time it is being removed into the 

 new building where it will attract attention in connection with the 

 collection of Mr. Clarence B. Moore and others belonging to the 

 Academy. 



Since the last report 158 specimens have been added to the collec- 

 tion of minerals, several being new species. Their removal into the 

 new building has been completed without loss or injury to any of the 

 specimens. The cabinet has been placed in good order. It has been 

 arranged on the first floor of the new building where, in consequence 

 of the abundance of light, it can be exhibited to advantage. 



Respectful ly submitted, 



Wm. W. Jefferis,
