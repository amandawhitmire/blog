TWO WEEKS COLLECTING IN GLACIER NATIONAL PARK. 

 BY ANNETTE F. BRAUN. 



During the summer of 1920, the writer had a brief, but very- 

 successful collecting trip in Glacier National Park, Montana, which 

 disclosed an unexpectedly rich insect fauna. A total of fourteen 

 days, in whole or part, was spent in collecting between July 14 and 

 July 29, inclusive. 



Glacier National Park lies in northwestern Montana, including 

 within its boundaries a mass of mountain peaks, the highest of which 

 rises to an elevation of 10,438 feet. It is traversed in a northwest- 

 southeastwardly direction by the Continental Divide. On the west 

 side, the waters flow into the Pacific through the Columbia River; 

 on the east side, in the south, to the Missouri River, in the north 

 beyond the Hudson Bay Divide, to Hudson Bay. Adjoining the 

 park on the east lie the foothills and plains; at the lower altitudes 

 on this side of the park, about 5000 feet, there is a blending of foot- 

 hills and mountain vegetation which may in part account for the 

 richness and diversity of the fauna in the dry mountain meadows 

 at this altitude. It was on the east side of the park that most of 

 my collecting was done. 



Although my attention was directed principally toward securing 

 as adequate a representation of Microlepidoptera as possible within 

 the limited time spent in the park, specimens in other groups of 



(1) 




2 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Part I 



Lepidoptera were collected when the opportunity offered. The 

 number of such species perhaps totals in the neighborhood of one 

 hundred. In addition a few general observations on the abundance 

 and distribution of other orders of insects in the various ecological 

 regions and at different altitudes were made and will be referred 

 to below. 



The region is forested except at the higher altitudes and on wind- 

 swept mountain sides, with a rather dense growth of coniferous 

 trees. Some of the steeper rocky slopes are comparatively treeless, 

 with a scanty herbaceous vegetation of many species, with scattered 

 spruce and pine. In addition to these, there are two other types of 

 comparatively treeless areas, which furnished the best collecting 

 grounds, both as to species and numbers of individuals. One of 

 these is the open dry rocky meadow, which supports a great variety 

 of herbaceous plants and which yielded the greatest number of 

 Microlepidoptera. The other is a moister meadow, with taller, 

 more luxuriant vegetation. 



The coniferous forest proved to be the poorest collecting ground 

 in the park. This was especially true where the predominant under- 

 growth was the Indian basket grass; here practically nothing was 

 secured. Where the undergrowth was of a more varied character, 

 particularly near the margins of streams, a greater number of spe- 

 cies was found. The Geometridae led in numbers here. 



The rather open steep rocky slopes and cliffs, of which the sides 

 of Goat Mountain above St. Mary Lake are an example, yielded 

 some species which were not found elsewhere. Collecting here was 

 only successful early in the morning, at sunrise just as the sun strikes 

 the rocks, or in the late afternoon. 



The moister meadow referred to above may be found in forest 

 openings, on the moister mountain slopes, or in the more sheltered 

 valleys, such as the valley of Canyon Creek or the upper part of 

 Swiftcurrent Valley. The most conspicuous herbaceous plants of 

 these meadows in July are the cow parsnip, Heracleum lanatum, and 

 the false forget-me-not, Lappula floribunda. Shrubs abound and 

 a dense growth of alders occurs where the water supply is plentiful 

 enough. Such localities proved to be prolific collecting grounds. 

 In the Microlepidoptera the most abundant and characteristic spe- 

 cies here was Choreutis occidentella Dyar. Simaethis fabriciana var. 

 alpinella Busck, several species of Incurvariidae flying in sunshine, 

 and Pterophoridae were usually present in considerable numbers. 

 Butterflies in limited numbers were seen also. Toward the end of 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 3 



July, Gnophaela latipennis var. vermiculata became very plentiful, 

 flying by dozens in the air above the alders. The numerous shrubs, 

 most of which were in bloom at the time of my stay, attracted 

 many Coleoptera, chiefly Longicorns, Clerids and Mordellids; Hy- 

 menoptera, of which the parasitic forms were especially noticeable, 

 and many Diptera, of which by far the greatest number were Syr- 

 phidae. The Coleoptera were most plentiful during the first four 

 or five days of my stay, and dwindled in numbers very markedly 

 toward the end of July. These meadows lie at altitudes of 4500 

 feet to 5500 feet. 



The dry meadow occupies drier, rocky and more exposed situa- 

 tions usually at altitudes around 5000 feet; good examples of such 

 meadows where extensive collections were made are found at Glacier 

 Park Station, the lower end of Two Medicine Lake, the north end 

 of McDermott Lake, and on the gentle slopes near the mouth of 

 Canyon Creek. These meadows are veritable flower gardens, ex- 

 hibiting an unsurpassed richness of flora. At the end of July, the 

 blooming period was about over at Glacier Park Station, and the 

 meadow was becoming dry and brown, with a corresponding dwind- 

 ling in species of Lepidoptera. These meadows are by far the 

 richest of any of the localities where collections were made in point 

 of species and numbers of individuals. Microlepidoptera were most 

 active early in the morning, while the dew was still on the leaves, 

 and in the evening at dusk. In most instances specimens taken in 

 the evening were of different species from those flying in the morn- 

 ing. Coleophora, Elachistidae, some Incurvariidae, many species of 

 Gelechiidae were the most characteristic groups present among the 

 Tineina; Tortricids were represented by a great number of species, 

 many very numerous in individuals, notably Cnephasia argentana 

 Clerck which flew in swarms; Pyralids, among which perhaps the 

 most common was Pyla sp., and many Crambids were present. 

 Butterflies flew plentifully during the middle of the day; these 

 were fairly numerous at all places during my stay in the park, but 

 became especially abundant during the last five or six days of July; 

 swarms of them congregated on every moist stream bank and on 

 the trails. The flowering shrubs, scattered through the meadows 

 and fringing the forests, attracted as in the moist meadows, many 

 Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera. 



The subalpine meadows occurred at the higher altitudes, 6000 

 feet or over, depending upon slope exposure, topographic conditions 

 and persistence of snow. These meadows produced a disappoint- 




4 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Part I 



ingly small number of species. The Gelechiid, Gnorimoschema och- 

 reostrigella, was the only really common micro; some species of 

 Tortricids were found, and Crambids were fairly numerous. Butter- 

 flies were not uncommon; and representatives of several genera of 

 day-flying Noctuids were captured on flowers. The most striking 

 feature of the insect fauna at the higher altitudes at this time was 

 the presence of great numbers of Syrphus flies, representing many 

 species. Bumble-bees were common in the meadows here, with a 

 mimicking Syrphus fly. 



The microlepidopterous fauna of the region shows a mingling of 

 elements derived from several physiographic areas; as might be 

 expected from its situation at the eastern edge of the Rocky Moun- 

 tains, with the plains to the east, and its connection with the Pacific 

 Coast and Sierra Nevada through the Columbia River Basin. Its 

 position in the Northern Rocky Mountain Region relates its flora 

 and fauna to that of the north and makes possible connections with 

 more easterly forms. Thus we have species here hitherto reported 

 from Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, from the more southern 

 Rocky Mountains, from the Sierra Nevada of California, from 

 Oregon, and species whose range includes the whole northern United 

 States and Canada. The Lepidoptera of the Kootenai District 

 of British Columbia (Dyar, 1904) is on the other hand, most nearly 

 related to that of the Sierra Nevada. This region, although not far 

 from Glacier National Park, lies entirely on the Pacific side of th e 

 Continental Divide in the Columbia River drainage basin. 



All of the localities mentioned in the following pages may be 

 found on the U. S. Geological Survey topographic map of Glacier 

 National Park. The altitudes of the chief points at which collec- 

 tions were made are as follows : 



Glacier Park Station, 4796 feet. 



Two Medicine Lake, 5175 feet. 



St. Mary, 4472 feet. 



Going-to-the-Sun Chalets, on St. Mary Lake, about 4600 feet. 



McDermott Lake, 4860 feet. 



Swiftcurrent Pass, 7176 feet. 



Granite Park, 6500 feet. 



In this paper only those species belonging to the families formerly 

 grouped together as Tineina are included. The Tortricid families of 

 which many species were collected are omitted here. In addition 

 to the species of Tineina recorded in this paper as occurring in 

 Glacier National Park, many others, chiefly Gelechiidae and Cole- 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 5 



ophoridae, some of them belonging to genera not reported from 

 this country, were collected. Strangely, no member of the family 

 Tineidae, which is usually well represented in collections from west- 

 ern localities, was secured. 



The types and paratypes of the new species are all for the present 

 in the writer's collection. 



COSMOPTERYGIDAE. 



Cyphophora tricristatella Chambers. 



Occurring most commonly in dry meadows at the lower altitudes 

 in the region (about 5000 feet); one specimen at Granite Park, 

 July 26 (6400 feet). 



Psacaphora deceptella n. sp. 



Palpi dark brown outwardly, with a silvery metallic luster in- 

 wardly; antennae dark brown, apical four or five segments black 

 preceded by six or seven white segments. Head and thorax leaden 

 metallic, with a purplish iridescence, base of wing silvery metallic 

 with blue and purple iridescence, followed by a large dark brown 

 patch on costa extending a little below fold. Ground color of 

 remainder of wing golden orange. The dark brown patch is edged 

 outwardly and beneath by bluish silvery metallic scales, which 

 extend outward beneath the fold to a large patch of dark brown 

 raised scales. A similar large patch of raised scales at tornus, pre- 

 ceded by a streak of metallic scales which forms its inner border 

 and then extends obliquely upward over the end of the cell to the 

 costal cilia; on the end of the cell these metallic scales form a slightly 

 convex patch. First discal spot round, silvery, edged with black. 

 A white costal spot at three-fourths. Extreme margin of the wing 

 around apex and cilia dark brown, with a faint purple luster; a 

 row of iridescent metallic scales around apex at base of cilia from 

 the white costal spot to the tornus. Hind wings dark brown. Legs 

 dark brown, tips of segments whitish. Abdomen dark brown above 

 and below. Expanse, 10 mm. 



Type (o 71 ), Glacier Park Station, July 29. 



Close to terminella Westwood ; at first glance mistakable for it. 

 The chief points of difference are the different coloration of the 

 antennae, the orange apex of the wings, and the details of the silvery 

 markings. 



Psacaphora sexstrigella n. sp. 



Palpi silvery white, the second segment densely dusted with 

 black in transverse rows, third segment with a few blackish specks. 

 Face yellowish, shading to dull leaden metallic on the crown. Tho- 

 rax and fore wings dark brown, mixed with leaden metallic scales, 

 which predominate in the basal two-thirds of the wing. Basal 




6 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Part I 



fifth of wing purplish; an orange spot at basal fifth below fold but 

 not reaching dorsum; a large black scale tuft near middle of wing 

 below fold; a similar tuft at tornus, bordered toward base with white 

 scales; a little behind this, on costa, a large white spot; a series of 

 six white streaks, three costal and three terminal, around apex, 

 arranged fan-like, not reaching into the cilia. Cilia brown, paler 

 at the base. Hind wings and cilia brownish gray. Legs black, 

 with tips of segments and a bar across the hind tibiae white. Ab- 

 domen dark brown, tip orange. Expanse, 9 mm. 



Type ( 9 ), McDermott Lake. 



The larva mines leaves of fireweed, Chamaenerion angustifolium, 

 making a linear mine which enlarges into a pale greenish blotch. 

 The imago emerged August 14. 



Mompha unifascieUa Chambers. 



The galls common throughout the park on stems of fireweed. 

 Imagoes emerged from August 12 to 22. 



GELECHIIDAE. 



In addition to the species which are referred to or described be- 

 low, a limited number each of other species were collected. 



Aristotelia rubidella Clemens. 



Common in the dry mountain meadows at about 5000 feet. 



Telphusa praefixa n. sp. 



Labial palpi dark fuscous, paler inwardly; a very narrow whitish 

 annulus is faintly indicated at the basal third of the second segment, 

 a broad white annulus at apical third; base, an annulus before the 

 tip and extreme tip of third segment white. Antennae fuscous, 

 annulate with pale gray above, most distinctly toward the apex. 

 Head pale gray, scales tipped with white. Thorax and fore wings 

 dark fuscous, sprinkled with black scales in the middle and apical 

 part of the wing; scales of the thorax and wing near the base min- 

 utely tipped with whitish. From basal fourth of costa an out- 

 wardly oblique pale fascia (scales pale gray, white-tipped, con- 

 colorous with the head), narrowing toward dorsum, reaches a little 

 beyond the fold; it is bordered inwardly by a heavy line of black 

 scales, which ends in a small patch of raised black and whitish scales 

 just below the fold. A small patch of raised black and white scales 

 on the fold beyond the fascia. An indistinct pale spot in the middle 

 of costa; an irregular transverse pale fascia at three-fourths con- 

 colorous with the oblique fascia, scarcely reaches the dorsum, and 

 sends a short broad inward projection basalwards in the middle of 

 the wing. At the inner edge of this projection is a small patch of 

 raised black scales. Cilia gray, speckled with white-tipped black 

 scales. Hind wings and cilia fuscous. Legs fuscous, barred with 

 white, tarsi white-tipped. Expanse, 13.5-14 mm. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 7 



Glacier Park Station, July 29, in a pine and aspen thicket. 

 Type and two paratypes in the writer's collection. 



Gnorimoschema ochreostrigella Chambers. 



This species is very common in the open meadows at the higher 

 altitudes. Many specimens collected at Granite Park and Swift- 

 current Pass, 6400 to 7100 feet; July 25-26. 



Some specimens show distinctly the ocherous streaking on the 

 fore wings; in others there is scarcely a vestige of the ochreous 

 tint, and the wing is of a dull drab color, dusted with fuscous. The 

 expanse of wings varies in these specimens from 12 to 17 mm. 



Gnorimoschema triocellella Chambers. 



Glacier Park Station, July 14. In some specimens the apical 

 portion of the wing except on the extreme margins is densely dusted 

 with nearly black scales. 



Gnorimoschema erigeronella o. sp. 



Palpi white inwardly, densely dusted with black beneath and 

 outwardly; base and a more or less distinct band near apex of second 

 segment whitish; base and extreme tip of third segment whitish. 

 Antennae whitish ochreous, banded with fuscous. Head and thorax 

 white, speeked with black, with some ochreous on the crown, and 

 on the patagia and median line of thorax. Fore wings ochreous, 

 marked with lines of white black-barred scales, which follow the 

 veins and the margins of the wing, leaving the fold ochreous. The 

 lower margin of the cell is broadly thus clothed, and the dorsal 

 part of the wing below the fold has only a short longitudinal streak of 

 ochreous which is sometimes entirely wanting. Around the apex 

 the scales on the interspaces are more broadly barred with black 

 than those along the veins. An elongate black spot or dash at the 

 middle of the cell just below and in contact with the line of scales 

 along the upper margin; a similar spot at the end of the cell. These 

 are the two most distinct spots, but there is usually an aggregation 

 of blackish scales on the fold just below the first discal spot; a similar 

 spot on the ochreous ground color just within the costal margin near 

 base. Hind wings silvery gray in the female, darker in the male; 

 cilia gray with ochreous bases. Legs white, densely dusted with 

 fuscous, hind tibiae faintly barred with white; tarsal segments tipped 

 with white. Expanse, 11.5-14 mm. 



Glacier Park Station, July 28; a specimen reared emerged Aug- 

 ust 13. 



Type (cT) and two paratypes ( 9 ) ; one of the females reared from 

 an irregular mine on Erigeron speciosus DC., collected July 14, 

 when most of the mines were untenanted. 




8 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Part I 



This species is very close to artemisiella Kearf . ; the two are almost 

 identically marked, but erigeronella is a narrow, more slender-winged 

 species and is considerably larger. 



Gnorimoschema contraria n. sp. 



Labial palpi blackish, minutely peppered with white; second seg- 

 ment whitish inwardly, third with a white spot within near base. 

 Antennae dark brown with narrow paler rings. Head and thorax 

 dark fuscous, patagia and tip of thorax reddish brown. Costal 

 two-thirds of the fore wing reddish brown, with the costa and veins 

 marked with lines of white broadly black-barred scales, the lines 

 sometimes confluent in the apical half of the wing; the dorsal third 

 of the wing from the base to the apex is clothed with white scales 

 barred before their tips with black of varying width. The dorsal 

 margin is distinctly lighter than the remainder of the wing. The 

 paler dorsal portion is irregular indented with blunt tooth-like 

 projections of the brown ground color; these teeth are partially 

 filled up and edged with blackish scales, heightening the contrast 

 between the two areas. Three of these patches of black scales stand 

 out prominently; an elongate one near base, one in each of the two 

 succeeding teeth and extending up onto the cell. Cilia fuscous, 

 specked with whitish black-barred scales. Hind wings and cilia 

 gray, with a faint reddish tinge. Legs densely dusted with fuscous. 

 Expanse, 15-16 mm. 



Type (d 71 ), McDermott Lake, July 22; three paratypes (cf and 9 ), 

 Glacier Park Station, July 14; in dry meadows. 



Although allied to the other longitudinally streaked species, the 

 paler dorsal margin gives it a very different aspect; the pattern 

 of the dorsal half of the wing is that of serratipalpella Chambers. 

 In the female, the brown ground color is less obscured by the dusted 

 lines than in the males. 



Anacampsis niveopulvella Chambers. 



Common at Glacier Park Station, where the larvae feed on willow 

 and aspen. Both this and the following species are referable to 

 Compsolechia Meyrick, if this genus is maintained distinct from 

 Anacampsis. 

 Anacampsis paltodoriella Busck. 



One specimen of this beautiful species taken on the car window, 

 exact locality not known, presumably western Montana. 

 The type locality is New Mexico. 



Gelechia lugubrella Fab. 



McDermott Lake, July 22; Glacier Park Station, July 29; in dry 

 meadows. Previously reported in this country from Maine. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 9 



Gelechia unifasciella Busck. 



Two Medicine Lake, July 15-16; in dry mountain meadows. 

 These specimens answer minutely the description of this species, 

 the types of which came from Williams, Arizona, but the expanse is 

 somewhat less (14-15 mm.). 



Gelechia metalLca n. sp. 



Palpi bronzy broWn, brush on second segment blackish. An- 

 tennae dark brown. Head, thorax ano\ fore wings lustrous dark 

 bronzy brown, the wings entirely immaculate; on underside of the 

 fore wings of the male a patch of yellowish oval slightly convex 

 scales covers the disc. Hind wings shining pale fuscous, with 

 slightly yellowish elongate scales on the disc. Abdomen purplish 

 black above, underside of abdomen and legs shining dark bronzy 

 brown. Expanse, 9.5-11.5 mm. 



Glacier Park Station, July 14 and 29, Going-to-the-Sun, July 20- 

 21; McDermott Lake, July 24; in dry mountain meadows, flying in 

 the early morning. 



Type (cf) and thirty paratypes, all males. 



Very unlike any other described American species. In the hind 

 wing, veins 3 and 4 are stalked, veins 6 and 7 closely approximated. 



Gelechia abradescens n. sp. 



Palpi, antennae and head dark brown; outer side of second seg- 

 ment of palpi with a few scattered whitish scales. Thorax and 

 fore wings shining dark brown, under a lens slightly irrorated; some- 

 times a few scattered whitish scales along the veins; an indistinct 

 elongate blackish spot at about the middle of the fold, and obliquely 

 above and beyond it in the cell a small blackish spot; a similar 

 but larger spot at the end of the cell; at apical third a whitish spot 

 on the costa, usually confined to the extreme costa, occasionally, 

 especially in the female, extending about one-quarter across the 

 wing. Cilia brownish gray, with a faint line of brown scales through 

 the middle. Hind wings brownish gray, cilia brown at their bases. 

 Underside of body and legs uniformly dark brown without paler 

 markings. Expanse, 17-20 mm. 



Glacier Park Station, July 14, in dry meadows. 



Type ( cf ) and eleven paratypes ( cf and 9 ) . 



This species seems to be allied to pravinominella, ornatifimbriella 

 and amorphaeella. 



The wings are very easily abraded, having then more of a dusted 

 appearance, due to exposure of the paler bases of the scales. In 

 such specimens the black spots are more conspicuous. 



Gelechia conspersa n. sp. 



Palpi pale grayish brown, mixed with whitish, third segment with 

 a minute black spot at the base outwardly. Antennae brown, 




10 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Part I 



banded with whitish. Head and thorax pale grayish brown. Fore 

 wings pale grayish brown, bases of scales whitish, dusted with scat- 

 tered whitish scales, which occur singly except in the apical third of 

 the wing, where they form ill-defined spots. A row of these extends 

 around the apex from the apical third of costa to the tornus. The 

 costal margin is slightly darkened before the first of these spots. 

 A faint darker small spot on disc and a larger one at end of cell. 

 Cilia whitish at their bases, brown at the tips with an indistinct 

 brownish line through the middle. Hind wings pale brownish gray, 

 cilia whitish at the base. Upper side of abdomen gray, tuft whitish. 

 Underside of body and legs, except the hind tibiae and tarsi, dark 

 brown, sparsely dusted with white. Hind tibiae and tarsi whitish 

 inwardly, dusted with brown outwardly except at tips of segments. 

 Expanse, 18-19 mm. 



Type (cf), McDermott Lake, July 24; one paratype, St. Mary, 

 July 18. 



Gelechia alternatella Kearfott. 



Two Medicine Lake, July 16, in dry meadows. 



Gelechia versutella Zeller. 



Very common on trunks of aspens, on the leaves of which the 

 larva feeds, Glacier Park Station, July 29. The moths are prac- 

 tically invisible except when moving, so closely do they resemble 

 the darker patches of bark. 



OECOPHORIDAE. 



Agonopteryx rosaciliella Busck. 



Reared from larvae sewing together leaves of sweet cicely, Os- 

 morhiza sp., near Going-to-the-Sun Chalets. Larvae collected 

 July 21; imago, August 7. 



Agonopteryx nivalis n. sp. 



Palpi creamy white, slightly shaded with brownish; antennae 

 brownish, darker toward the tips. Head, thorax and fore wings 

 creamy white; fore wings with a faint rusty tinge beneath fold near 

 base of dorsum and along apical third of costa. Minute brownish 

 and blackish spots along costa, three or four larger and more diffuse 

 on apical third; last row of scales along termen between veins, 

 brown; a few scattered brown scales, chiefly along the veins; a very 

 small black spot within the costa near base; a small black spot on 

 middle of cell and obliquely above and before it, a second similar 

 spot; a larger transverse spot at end of cell. Hind wings creamy 

 white. Legs white, dusted with fuscous, the fore pair most densely. 

 Expanse, 23 mm. 



Type (cf), Two Medicine Lake, July 16. 



Perhaps most like pallidella Busck, but without demarcation be- 

 tween basal area and remainder of wing. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 11 



Enicostoma quinquecristata n. sp. 



Labial palpi with the anterior edge of second segment pale reddish 

 ochreous, a black spot near base and above middle; remaining scales 

 of brush gray with white tips; third segment yellowish, with an 

 annulus near base and the tip bJack. Antennae gray. Scales of 

 head and thorax gray, with white tips. Fore wings ashen brown, 

 more or less thickly bestrewn with dark gray, minutely white-tipped 

 scales, with a tendency to longitudinal streaking in the apical third 

 of the wing; groups of brown white-tipped scales form a series of 

 indistinct marginal spots around the apex. Five scale tufts formed 

 of white-tipped black scales; at one-third, a very large tuft on fold 

 and' a smaller one above in the cell ; a large tuft at the lower angle 

 of the cell and a smaller one above it; between these two pairs, 

 on the middle of the cell, a fifth large tuft. Cilia grayish brown, 

 with scales white-tipped. Hind wings pale gray, cilia fulvous at 

 the base. Legs densely dusted with gray, hairs on upper side of 

 hind tibiae pale brownish, spreading scales on underside gray with 

 white tips. Expanse, 17-19 mm. 



Type (cf), Two Medicine Lake. 



The type and twelve paratypes ( cf and 9 ) reared from larvae 

 webbing leaves of Penstemon confertus Dougl., a common small- 

 flowered pale yellow species, collected on the trail to Dawson Pass, 

 Two Medicine Lake, altitude about 5500 feet. The larva lives 

 under a web in a folded leaf, eating out patches of the leaf. The 

 web is usually on the upper side, sometimes on the lower side of the 

 leaf near the base. Surface of pupa clothed with fine erect hairs. 

 Imagoes, August 6-17. 



Although the food plant' was common everywhere throughout the 

 region in the dry meadow at the lower altitudes, the larva of this 

 species was not observed elsewhere. 



The generic position of the species was determined by Dr. Ed- 

 ward Meyrick, who states that it agrees with the type of the genus 

 in all essential particulars, except in the palpi. In E. quinquecristata, 

 the second segment of the palpi is more thickened with scales, and 

 these are more expanded toward apex than in the type. 



The genus Enicostoma is given in Dyar's "List" as a synonym of 

 Semioscopis. 



For convenience of reference, a detailed statement of the generic 

 characters as shown by E. quinquecristata follows: 



Head with loosely appressed scales, side tufts projecting in front; 

 tongue developed, densely scaled except towards tip. Antennae 

 two-thirds, with slightly spreading whorls of scales at apices of 

 segments, alike in both sexes, basal segment without pecten. Labial 

 palpi very long, recurved; second segment clothed with a dense

triangular brush of scales beneath and above, laterally compressed, 

 sharp-edged in front, .brush horizontally truncate at apex; third 

 segment slender, acute, seeming to arise from center of the brush of 

 second, visible portion about one-third the length of the second. 

 Maxillary palpi short, appressed to tongue, third segment equaling 

 in length the two preceding segments. Posterior tibiae clothed 

 with long hairs above, and rough spreading long scales beneath. 

 Fore wings with large tufts of raised scales; lb furcate at base, 

 2, 3 and 4 about equidistant, 2 from near end of cell ; 2 and 3 arising 

 perpendicular to lower margin of cell, curving outward and running 

 straight to termen; 5 nearer 4, 7 and 8 stalked, 7 to costa almost 

 at apex, 11 from before middle. Hind wings 1, elongate-ovate, 

 cilia 1; 3 and 4 connate, 5-7 parallel, 5 nearer 6. 

 Epicallima quadrimaculella Chambers. 



Amongst rocks, near Going-to-the-Sun, on St. Mary Lake, July 20- 

 21. All of the specimens were taken flying in the sunshine at sun- 

 rise, and none were seen later than 7.30 A. M. 

 Epicallima dimidiella Walsingham. 



Two Medicine Lake, July 15; Going-to-the-Sun, July 18 and 21. 

 Flying actively only in early morning; several taken flying in com- 

 pany with E. quadrimaculella. 



Borkhausenia haydenella Chambers. 



Two males and one female of this species were collected, one male 



at Two Medicine Lake, July 15, the other two specimens on the 



cliffs on Goat Mountain above Going-to-the-Sun Chalets, July 18. 



The female has the wing more densely dusted with white than the 



male, and the transverse spot at the basal third large and more 



clearly defined. 



ETHMIIDAE. 



Ethmia albistrigella Walsingham. 



Two Medicine Lake, July 16; Granite Park, 6500 feet, July 25. 

 Collected near plants of false forget-me-not, Lappula floribunda, 

 which may possible be the food plant. 



GLYPHIPTERYGIDAE. 

 Simaethis fabriciana var. alpinella Busck. 



St. Mary, July 18; Canyon Creek, 5500 feet, July 23, in openings 

 in the forest. 



Choreutis pernivalis n. sp. 



Head and palpi whitish, scales of tuft fuscous towards tips. Basal 

 half of fore wing light brown, with a broad straight pure white 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 13 



fascia across the middle of the brown; fascia margined outwardly 

 along the middle of its length with silvery scales; a basal streak of 

 silvery scales just within the costal margin. Outer half of wing 

 white, except a narrow band around apex and along termen, which 

 is ochreous, dusted with white and fuscous. White patch with two 

 longitudinal black and , one or two fuscous lines of scales; the two 

 black lines ending at the outer border of the white patch in con- 

 fluent black spots, nearly overlaid with silvery scales; a wedge- 

 shaped black spot beneath these, silvery margined, and a large 

 quadrate black patch just above fold, with two transverse lines of 

 silvery scales and a few silvery scales at its upper outer angle. Cilia 

 white with a pale fuscous line through the middle. White marks 

 more or less distinctly repeated on the underside. Hind wings 

 more pointed than usual, brownish fuscous, underside with a whitish 

 irregular submarginal patch; ground color shading darkest next to 

 this patch. Underside of thorax white, abdomen fuscous. Legs 

 whitish, tibiae and tarsi brownish. Expanse, 11.5-12 mm. 



Type (cf), and one paratype (9), Glacier Park Station, July 14. 



Very close to extrincicella Dyar, from which it differs by the pure 

 white of the fore wings, the whitish irregular patch on the under- 

 side of the hind wings, and the narrower wings, particularly the 

 narrower more pointed hind wings. 



Choreutis caliginosa n. sp. 



Palpi fuscous and white intermixed; antennae dark brown, with 

 white annulations. Head and thorax dark brownish gray, a few 

 scales at the posterior margin of the head and a very narrow line 

 along the inner edge of the patagia whitish. Fore wings dark brown ; 

 a curved whitish fascia at basal fourth, palest and broadest on the 

 dorsum and not reaching the costa; a basal streak of iridescent 

 scales just within the costa; outer half of the wing, except the apical 

 part, occupied by a paler patch of whitish-tipped brown scales, 

 marked at the inner and outer edge on the costa by a white spot, 

 below which are a few iridescent scales; before the pale patch on the 

 dark brown ground color in the middle of the wing is a black spot, 

 nearly overlaid with iridescent scales. On the pale patch, above the 

 middle, a small black spot with iridescent scales, three or four longi- 

 tudinal black lines running out into the ground color in the apex; 

 below, a large quadrate patch, sometimes divided transversely, 

 containing two transverse patches of iridescent scales. A few iri- 

 descent scales along termen below apex. Hind wings dark brown, 

 on underside an irregular paler submarginal band. Expanse, 10.5- 

 11 mm. 



Type (cf), paratype (9), Two Medicine Lake, July 16; in dry 

 meadows. 



Close to occidentella Dyar, but smaller and darker, and with the 

 oblique iridescent streak beyond the basal fascia in that species 

 replaced by a black spot overlaid with iridescent scales. 




14 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Part I 



Choreutis occidentella Dyar. 



This is one of the commonest micros in the region at altitudes 

 from 4500 to 5500 feet in moist meadows or forest openings. Speci- 

 mens taken at Glacier Park Station, July 14; Two Medicine Lake, 

 July 15-16; St. Mary, July 18; Canyon Creek, July 23. In some 

 of these specimens the small black spot with iridescent scales above 

 the large quadrate spot is absent; the ground color varies from 

 an ochreous brown to dark grayish brown. 



Choreutis balsamorrhizella Busck. 



Near Going-to-the-Sun Chalets, St. Mary Lake, July 20; flying 

 around the food plant. 



PLUTELLIDAE. 



Plutella vanella Walsingham. 



Glacier Park Station-, July 29. 



Plutella maculipennis Curt. 



This species was observed to be abundant in the park. 



YPONOMEUTIDAE. 



Argyresthia oreasella Clemens. 



One specimen taken at Glacier Park Station, July 29, cannot 

 be differentiated from eastern specimens. Oak cannot be the food 

 plant here, at least, as there are no oaks here. 



COLEOPHORIDAE. 



Judging from the number collected during the short stay in the 

 park, the region is unusually rich in species of Coleophora. Twelve 

 species were collected of which ten seem to be undescribed. Of 

 these, but two are here described, the others are either represented by 

 too short series, or are not sufficiently striking in the absence of a 

 knowledge of the life history, to be described except in monographic 

 work. 

 Coleophora tenuis Walsingham. 



One specimen, Two Medicine Lake, July 16, taken in dry meadows, 

 answers well the description of this species, but is slightly smaller 

 (15 mm. expanse). 



Coleophora albacostella Chambers. 



Very common, Glacier Park Station, July 14 and July 28, flying 

 amongst patches of Polygonum erectum, upon which it probably 

 feeds. Chambers' type came from Texas, which is included in the 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 15 



range of this plant. There is one other specimen in my collection 

 from Tolland, Colorado. 



Coleophora brunneipennis n. sp. 



Palpi brownish ochreous, shaded with fuscous beneath and on the 

 outer side, second segment rather long, slightly tufted, third seg- 

 ment a little over one-half the second. Antennae brown, banded 

 with whitish, basal segment thickened with scales. Head, thorax 

 and fore wings of a uniform light brown or brownish ochreous color, 

 rarely duller with a grayish suffusion, but always entirely without 

 markings or dusting. Cilia concolorous, toward tornus brownish 

 fuscous. Hind wings and cilia fuscous. Legs brown. Expanse, 

 12-17 mm. 



Type (cf), Glacier Park Station, July 14, eighteen paratypes 

 (d* and 9 ), Glacier Park Station, July 14 and 28. 



This species was much commoner on July 14 than at the later 

 date, when only four specimens were secured. A number of the 

 specimens were taken on flowers of Erigeron speciosus; some speci- 

 mens were taken at the same time and place as the preceding species, 

 amongst Polygonum. It is possible that one of these plants is the 

 food plant of the larva. 



Coleophora crinita n. sp. 



Second segment of labial palpi very long, porrected, clothed with 

 long scales, roughened above, with a long projecting truncate tuft 

 beneath at apex, exceeding the short third segment and sometimes 

 concealing it, whitish, fuscous beneath and on outer side. Head 

 and basal segment of antennae whitish ochreous, the latter slightly 

 thickened with scales, antennal stalk white, banded above with 

 dark brown. Fore wings pale ochreous or brownish ochreous, with 

 the costa from base to apex white, the dorsal margin more narrowly 

 white from base to apex of wing, a rather broad white streak from 

 base above and parallel to the fold, a narrow parallel streak close 

 to it just below the fold, four oblique white streaks running out 

 into the costal cilia along the veins , two less distinct streaks running 

 into the cilia below apex. Hind wings and cilia grayish ochreous. 

 Legs whitish, with a fuscous line along the outer side. Expanse, 

 12-18 mm. 



Type (cf), July 22, McDermott Lake, eighteen paratypes (cf and 

 9), Going-to-the-Sun, July 20-21, McDermott Lake, July 22 and 

 24, Glacier Park Station, July 29, all in dry meadows. 



The long palpi, with the unusually long projecting tuft of the 

 second segment, are the chief characters for recognition of this 

 species. The markings of the fore wing are exactly those of C. 

 acutipennella Wlsm.; in fact, the figure and description of the wing 

 of that species would serve equally well for the present species. 




16 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Part I 



Walsingham, however, mentions no unusual features of the palpi 

 in his species. 



ELACHISTIDAE. 



Elachista stramineola n. sp. 



Palpi whitish inwardly and above ; second segment black outwardly 

 except at extreme tip; third segment blackish outwardly except at 

 base and extreme tip. Antennae blackish, faintly marked with 

 narrow paler annulations. Head yellowish gray. Thorax gray, 

 patagia whitish, sparsely speckled with fuscous. Fore wings fus- 

 cous, a little dusted with yellowish white, especially in the basal 

 third. At base of dorsum a yellowish white patch, not extending 

 onto the costal half of base, is specked with a few fuscous scales; a 

 white slightly irregular fascia at one-third nearest base on costa; 

 a triangular costal spot at two-thirds reaching halfway across the 

 wing, and a little nearer base on dorsum a short broad whitish spot. 

 Scales along termen yellowish toward their bases; last row of scales 

 along termen with a whitish bar immediately preceding the black 

 tip. Cilia gray. Hind wings and cilia pale fuscous. Legs fuscous, 

 tips of segments and a bar across basal third of hind tibiae yellowish 

 white. Abdomen grayish above, yellowish white beneath. Ex- 

 panse, 11.5 mm. 



Type ( 9 ), Glacier Park Station, July 29, in dry meadows. 



This species may be distinguished from all other species with 

 white at the base of the wing by the* dull yellowish white of the 

 markings and the position of the basal pale patch, which is confined 

 to the dorsal half of the wing. Venation as figured in Meyrick's 

 "Handbook." 



-Elachista agilis n. sp. 



Palpi dark brown, antennae dark brown. Head and thorax dark 

 leaden metallic. Fore wings dark brown, somewhat shining, with 

 metallic silvery or golden markings: at basal fourth on dorsum, 

 an oblique spot reaching the fold, at middle of costa a nearly per- 

 pendicular transverse spot nearly reaching the fold, in a line with 

 this spot a small roundish spot below the fold, a spot at tornus and 

 farther out, a curved costal streak, sometimes nearly enclosing the 

 apex. Hind wings and cilia brownish gray. Underside of body 

 silvery. Legs dark brown, femora, apex and spurs of tibiae, and 

 tips of tarsi of the hind legs silvery. Expanse, 7 mm. 



Type (d") and one paratype, Goat Mountain, above Going-to- 

 the-Sun Chalets, about 5000 feet, July 18. 



An easily recognized species, quite different from any of our 

 described species. Venation as figured in Meyrick's "Handbook." 



Elachista aurocristata n. sp. 



Palpi white, antennae white, shading outwardly to fuscous in the 

 male. Head, thorax and fore wings white, with a scarcely percep- 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 17 



tible yellowish tinge in the female. Fore wings usually entirely 

 immaculate, sometimes with a few scattered brownish ochreous 

 scales; one or two such scales near end of fold, at end of cell and in 

 the apex and along termen. A faint narrow blackish line some- 

 times present in the cilia at apex and along termen. Hind wings 

 white or pale gray. Legs white, shaded with fuscous. Abdomen 

 white, in the male shaded with golden yellow beneath, and with a 

 golden yellow anal tuft. Expanse, 12 mm. 



Glacier Park Station, July 14 and 29; in dry meadows. 



Type ( cf ) and three paratypes (one d 71 and two 9 's) . 



Only in one of the males are the scattered ochreous scales present 

 on the fore wings ; the wings in the other three specimens are entirely 

 immaculate. 



Allied to E. orestella Busck, with which it agrees in venation; 

 but easily distinguished by the golden anal tuft of the male. 



Tinagma gigantea n. sp. 



Labial palpi yellowish white above, scales of tuft grayish. An- 

 tennae grayish, tinged with ochreous beneath. Head and thorax 

 dusted about equally with whitish and pale gray. Scales of the 

 ground color of the fore wings are pale gray at their bases, shading 

 into white of varying width, followed by a black tip. A broad 

 blackish transverse fascia just before middle of wing, ill-defined 

 on its inner edge, . narrowly margined with white on its outer edge, 

 and outwardly obtusely angulated on the cell; a similar dark shade, 

 its margins not defined, crosses at two-thirds, fading out into the 

 general ground color toward apex. Marginal row of scales nearly 

 black, cilia dark gray. Hind wings dark gray. Legs blackish, 

 slightly dusted with gray; tips of tarsi pale' gray. Expanse, 14-15 

 mm. 



McDermott Lake, July 22-24; Going-to-the-Sun ,July 20; Glacier 

 Park Station, July 28-29; in dry meadows. 



Type (cf ), July 24; twenty-one paratypes. 



This species flies at dusk. The moth has the peculiar habit of 

 slowly raising and lowering the wing. 



The markings are similar to those of T. obscurofasciella Chambers, 

 but T. gigantea is much larger and lacks the brownish tint of that 

 species. 



Tinagma pulverilinea n. sp. 



Labial palpi white, with black specks outwardly. Antennae pale 

 gray. Head and thorax white, dusted with black. Scales of the 

 general ground color of the fore wing with base gray, followed by a 

 usually broad white bar, black-tipped. A broad dark transverse 

 fascia just before middle of wing, convex outwardly and bordered 

 outwardly by a row of scales which are almost entirely white. A 




18 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Part I 



similar dark fascia at two-thirds, convex inwardly and bordered 

 inwardly by a broken line of white scales. In some specimens, the 

 effect of these two white margins with the whitish dusted scales 

 between them is that of a bi-concave dusted white-margined fascia. 

 The second dark fascia sometimes passes imperceptibly into the white 

 dusted apex, sometimes is more or less limited outwardly by an 

 incomplete line of white scales. Marginal line of scales fuscous, 

 cilia gray. Hind wings gray. Legs white, dusted with black, hind 

 pair most densely. Thorax beneath nearly pure white, abdomen 

 dusted with black. Expanse, 9-11 mm. 



On cliffs on the side of Goat Mountain, above Going-to-the-Sun 

 Chalets, July 18, flying in the sun. 



Type ( cf ) and four paratypes ( o* and 9 ) . 



In general appearance quite different from the other two Amer- 

 ican species of the genus, but with the same type of markings. 



GRACILARIIDAE. 



Lithocolletis oregonsis Walsingham. 



Mines collected near Baring Creek, July 20, on Symphoricarpos 

 sp. The mine is a small tent mine on the underside of the leaf, 

 with epidermis much wrinkled and a patch of leaf tissue in the 

 middle of the mine not consumed. Imago, July 28. The species 

 was described from Oregon. 



Acrocercops astericola F. and B. 



McDermott Lake, July 24. I also have specimens of this species 

 from southern Oregon. 



Gracilaria acerifoliella Chambers. 



I refer with little doubt to this species, specimens reared on a 

 bush maple (Acer sp.), near Going-to-the-Sun Chalets. 



In these specimens, there is none of the brown dusting described 

 by Chambers for this species, but the wings are pale brownish or 

 reddish ochreous, with purple reflections and a pale costal triangle 

 produced along the costa. Inasmuch as similar undusted forms 

 occur in other species (for example, G. ostryaeella Chambers), the 

 identification is probably correct. The larval habits agree closely 

 with those described for G. acerfoliella; a large leaf is often entirely 

 folded up by the time the larva finishes eating. 



Larvae collected July 18, imagoes August 6-14. 



Gracilaria alnivoreUa Chambers. 



The larvae were very common at the lower altitudes on alder. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 19 



SCYTHRIDAE. 



Scythris magnatella Busck. 



Larvae in webs on fireweed (Chamaenerion angustifolium) , imagoes 

 August 5. 



Scythris impositella Zeller. 



Glacier Park Station, July 29. Mines, presumably of this spe- 

 cies, were observed on Aster and on Arnica sp. 



Scythris eboracensis Zeller. 



Two Medicine Lake, July 16; Going-to-the-Sun, July 20-21. 

 Some of these specimens are unusually pale and grayish. 



LYONETIIDAE. 

 With the exception of Tischeria heliopsisella Chambers, which 

 was a common miner on sunflower near Baring Creek, only one 

 other member of this family was observed, a Bucculatrix feeding 

 on Arnica sp. 



INCURVARIIDAE. 



Lampronia quieta n. sp. 



Palpi brownish yellow, outer side of labial palpi dark brown; 

 antennae dark brown, face and head brownish yellow. Thorax 

 brown, patagia and a small spot on the middle of the base of the 

 fore wing buff. Fore wing brown, scarcely shining, marked with 

 pale buff spots; a large oblique quadrate spot at basal fourth on 

 dorsum, reaching a little more than halfway across the wing; a 

 large costal spot at two-thirds, concave on its inner side, convex 

 on its outer side, and produced a little along the costa towards apex; 

 a dorsal spot just before tornus, with its inner edge perpendicular 

 to the margin, its outer edge oblique; a narrow elongate spot along 

 termen below apex; costal cilia brown, buff -tipped towards apex, 

 cilia buff at apex and on termen to the lower end of the buff spot, 

 thence dark brown to the tornus. Hind wings and cilia gray. Legs 

 buff, the two anterior pair with fuscous shading. Expanse, 18 

 mm. 



Type ( 9 ) , Canyon Creek, 5500 feet, July 23 ; resting on a rock 

 near the water. 



Nearest to taylorella Kearf., but without the purple and coppery 

 luster of that species. 



Lampronia obscuromaculata n. sp. 



Palpi gray, second segment of labial palpi white above; antennae 

 gray, white scaled toward base, cilia of the male 1 ; head with gray 

 and whitish hairs intermixed. Fore wings shining very pale gray, 

 with a few scattered fuscous scales, base of costa fuscous; marked 




20 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Part I 



with scarcely defined white spots and fasciae placed- as follows: 

 a spot in the fold near base; a quadrate spot on basal third of dor- 

 sum reaching just beyond fold; just beyond middle a transverse 

 fascia; at apical fourth of costa a spot reaching about halfway across 

 the wing. Hind wings and cilia gray, darker than the fore wings, 

 with purplish iridescence, thinly scaled. Legs gray. Expanse, 15 

 mm. 



Type (cf), Two Medicine Lake, July 16; in dry meadows. 



In this specimen, veins 7 and 8 of the fore wing are coincident 

 as in Greya, but the other characters and the general habitus of the 

 insect are those of Lampronia. As shown by the following species, 

 such individual variations occur. 



Lampronia variata n. sp. 



Palpi brownish gray, labial palpi with whitish scales above; an- 

 tennae black ; head brownish, some whitish hairs on the face. Tho- 

 rax and fore wings shining bronzy brown; at basal third of dorsum 

 a pale yellowish spot reaching the fold; just before tornus a pale 

 yellowish spot reaching two-thirds across the wing. Tips of cilia 

 whitish. Hind wings dark brown with a faint purple luster. Legs 

 c/ark brown. Expanse, 11 mm. 



Type (cf ), Two Medicine Lake, July 16; paratypes (c? and 9 ), 

 Two Medicine Lake, July 15, in forest openings. 



In some of these specimens 7 and 8 of the fore wings are coin- 

 cident. 



Lampronia politella Walsingham. 



Three males, Two Medicine Lake, July 15, Going-to-the-Sun, 

 July 21, collected in early morning in the dry meadows. The ex- 

 panse, 18-20 mm., is somewhat more than that given by Walsing- 

 ham; but in other respects, these specimens agree closely with the 

 description, showing very markedly the aeneous tinge of the fore 

 wings. 

 Lampronia piperella Busck. 



Two Medicine Lake, July 15, in dry meadows; one female speci- 

 men which has all the veins of the fore wing present and palpal 

 characters as in the other species of the genus, and not as described 

 for the very similar Greya punctiferella Walsingham. 



CHALCEOPLA nom. nov. 



This generic name is proposed to replace Cyanauges Braun (Ohio 

 Jour. Sci., XX, 24, 1919), preoccupied by Cyanauges Gorham in 

 the Coleoptera. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 21 



Chalceopla itoniella Busck. 



Two Medicine Lake, July 16; Canyon Creek, July 23; Swift- 

 current Valley, July 27 ; flying in sunshine. 



In Chalceopla itoniella veins 7 and 8 of the fore wing are separate, 

 as is also the case in the two following species. The genus Chal- 

 ceopla is most easily recognized by the spreading bristles below 

 and at apex of second segment of the labial palpi, the minute or 

 small maxillary palpi and the two kinds of scales, the greenish or 

 bluish broad scales and the elongate metallic scales. 



Chalceopla cockerelli Busck. 



Two Medicine Lake, July 16. 



Chalceopla ovata n. sp. 



Second segment of labial palpi white, with black bristles, terminal 

 segment black; hairs of head whitish; antennae black. Thorax and 

 fore wings shining bronzy brown, with pale yellowish markings; a 

 small elongate spot in fold near base; a spot on middle of dorsum 

 reaching fold; an oblique curved patch at three-fifths of costa is 

 narrow on the costa, but expands into an oval in the middle of the 

 wing. Hind wings dark brown with a purple tinge, and with dull 

 golden metallic scales on the margin projecting into the cilia. Legs 

 dark brown with a bronzy luster. Expanse, 7.5 mm. 



Type ( 9 ), July 18, on the cliffs on Goat Mountain above Going- 

 to-the-Sun Chalets. 



There is no differentiation in shape between the metallic over- 

 scales and the ordinary scales in this species in the fore wing; on 

 the hind wing, metallic scales are only found at the extreme margin. 



Greya subalba n. sp. 



Labial palpi whitish, third segment black beneath; maxillary 

 palpi short, folded portion reduced to a short segment, which is 

 usually not bent over in the dead insect; antennae gray; head white. 

 Fore wings varying in color from shining white to pale buff, with 

 base of costa fuscous. Hind wings gray, with whitish cilia. Legs 

 white, fuscous shading on the two anterior pair. Expanse, cf , 

 14-16.5 mm.; 9 , 11-14 mm. 



Type (d 1 ), Two Medicine Lake, July 16; twenty-two paratypes 

 (cf and 9), Glacier Park Station, July 14, Two Medicine Lake, 

 July 15-16, McDermott Lake, July 23, all in dry meadows. 



The whitish immaculate fore wings distinguish this species from 

 the others of the genus. The terminal segment of the maxillary 

 palpi is only about half the length of the corresponding part in 

 Greya solenobiella Wlsm. 




22 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Part I 



MICROPTERYGIDAE. 



ACANTHOPTEROCTETES new genus. 



Labial palpi very short, directed outwardly. Maxillary palpi 

 long, filiform, folded. Tongue short. Head densely rough-haired. 

 Antennae four-fifths, slender, filiform, smoothly scaled, basal seg- 

 ment slightly swollen. Middle tibiae with one apical spur, posterior 

 tibiae smooth, middle and apical spurs long. 



Fore wing: elongate lanceolate, fibula large, second and third 

 anal veins separate and distinct to the margin, Cu and 1st A co- 

 alesced at base, posterior arculus distinct, Cui and Cw 2 distant, 

 base of media distinct, not forked within the cell, forming an almost 

 straight linewith M 3 + 4 , transverse vein perpendicular between Cvi 

 and Ms + 4 , and nearly meeting the very oblique transverse vein 

 between Ms + 4 and R t + 5 , which becomes obsolescent near M 3 + 4 , 

 M2 arising near the middle of the oblique transverse vein, Mi from 

 middle of stalk of R A and Z? 5 , R* and R 6 long stalked, R & to apex, 

 R t + 3 coincident, from near end of cell, #1 from before middle, with 

 an accessory vein, Sc not forked, humeral vein present. 



Hind wing: elongate lanceolate, 

 a little narrower than the fore 

 wing, without frenulum, but with 

 series of costal spines, venation 

 similar to that of the fore wing, 

 with the exception of the anasto- 

 mosis of the first and second anal 

 veins near the base, the absence of the transverse vein between 

 Cui and M 3 + 4 , absence of accessory vein from R t . 

 Genotype, Acanthopteroctetes tripunctata n. sp. 

 The forking of the base of media nearer to the margin than in 

 other Micropterygid genera has resulted in a nearly straight discal 

 vein, and a consequent configuration of the discal cell similar to 

 that in other Lepidoptera. The presence of three separate anal 

 veins in the fore wing is an unusual feature. The presence or ab- 

 sence of a cross-vein between the first and second anal veins of the 

 fore wing could not be observed without injury to the unique type. 

 This genus belongs in the subfamily Eriocranianae, but is not 

 closely related to any described genus. It is nearest to Eriocrania. 

 In addition to the species described below, I have a single speci- 

 men, in rather poor condition, of another species of this genus from 

 the southern Sierras. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 23 



Acanthopteroctetes tripunctata n. sp. 



Palpi brown with a slight golden tinge, hairs of the head reddish 

 brown; antennae blackish brown, basal segment paler. Fore wings 

 brown, with a faint golden and purplish luster, bases of scales a 

 little paler; a slightly irregular yellowish spot on the disc at one- 

 third, at three-fifths, a yellowish costal and an opposite dorsal spot 

 nearly meeting. Scales at apex a little paler. Hind wings brown, 

 a little darker than the fore wings. Legs dark brown. Abdomen 

 dark brown, median line beneath paler. Expanse, 11 mm. 



Type (o"), Canyon Creek, 5500 feet, July 23; flying in sunshine 

 in a forest opening. 



The general appearance of this moth suggests a Tineid rather 

 than a Micropterygid.

SOME FAUNAL REMAINS FROM THE TRIAS OF YORK COUNTY, 

 PENNSYLVANIA. 



BY H. E. WANNER. 



Plants from the Trias of York County have been reported and 

 described under thirty-three species, twelve of which are new. 1 

 In the same region, so productive of fossil flora, faunal remains 

 have been less in evidence. Only three species*, all based on frag- 

 mentary saurian remains, have been described, two by Cope and 

 one by Sinclair. 2 



In the hope that a contribution to the knowledge of the faunal 

 life of this locality would be an acceptable addition to the palaeon- 

 tology of the Newark System, this paper is presented. 3 



1 am indebted to my father for inspiration and for whatever love 

 of the science of geology I possess. He materially assisted in the 

 field work and in the collection of specimens. I am also under obli- 

 gations to Dr. H. A. Pilsbry for counsel and assistance and for the

to the S. W. 5 The basal layer here is a limestone conglomerate. 

 Sandstones, shale and conglomerates occur in the succeeding layers 

 and farther north a large intrusion of diabase. This forms the 

 elevation known as the Conewago hills. All of the rocks examined 

 dip N. W. at an angle varying from 15 to 24 degrees. No evidences 

 of faulting or folding were observed.

The localities described in this paper are about three miles north 

 of Emigsville (fig. 1). Taking the average dip as 20 degrees and 

 calculating from the dip and horizontal distances, the productive 

 layers are, approximately, 6600 feet above the basal conglomerate. 7 

 Correlation and definite location of these layers is difficult without 

 a section across the Trias. 



Two columnar sections are given (figs. 2 and 3) showing the rela- 

 tive positions of the productive strata. These sections are of interest 

 because they show the rapid alternation of the sediments. The 

 physical and lithological character of the shale varies considerably 

 even in the same layer. In one place it may be hard and compact

Historical Geology. 



In general, geologists now regard the theory of continental origin 

 of the beds of the Newark System as definitely proven. 8 9 10 



From the floral remains the triassic rocks of York County are 

 placed by Fontaine in the Upper Trias and correlated with the 

 Rhetic of Bavaria. 11 Lull, from the faunal remains of the Con- 

 necticut valley, states that "the Newark System may bridge the 

 time between the Triassic and Jurassic." 12 



The presence of at least five different fresh-water mollusca in 

 the York County Trias is indicative of fresh rather than saline- 

 water conditions. The carbonaceous black shale containing the 

 fish scales and fossil plants proves the presence of luxuriant vege- 

 tation in swamps, or lakes. This conclusion is still further verified 

 by the occurrence of thin coal lenses and numerous casts of limbs. 13 



CRUSTACEANS. 



The shells of two species of small crustaceans are found closely 

 associated in the black shales. These were identified as Candona 

 rogersi (Lea) and Estheria ovata (Jones). 14 The former are found more 

 abundantly and often cover the surface of the matrix in densely 

 crowded masses. Localities: Carbonaceous shale, Little Cone- 

 wago (loc. 3); Black shale, York Haven (loc. 4). 



FISHES. 



The great variety of fish scales (Plate I, figs. 1-17) warrants their 

 presentation. Some of the specimens are sufficiently different from 

 known forms to indicate the presence of new species. The scales

occur in a matrix containing macerated and obscured remains of 

 vegetation, an occasional fish spine, and minute fragments of bones. 

 A striking characteristic of nearly all the scales found is their highly 

 enamelled coating. By reason of the fragmentary nature of the 

 material, no attempt has been made at identification. However, 

 because of the enamelled surfaces of the scales, there is probably 

 sufficient justification for provisionally classifying the fishes as 

 ganoids. 15 



Locality: Carbonaceous shale, Little Conewago (loc. 3). 



REPTILIAN REMAINS. 



Coprolites (Plate I, figs. 18, 19) are found associated with the 

 fish remains. These are usually of an elongated, oval form, vary- 

 ing in shape, and from 2 to 60 mm. in length. A cross section made 

 through one of these reveals fish scales and microscopic fragments of 

 bones. 



Localities: Shale, York Haven (loc. 4); Carbonaceous Shale, 

 Little Conewago (loc. 3). 



A few bones and teeth have been found in the Trias of York 

 County. Some of these have been referred to species by Cope and 

 Sinclair. 16 No attempt was made by either of these authorities 

 to locate the horizon. The conglomerate layer shown in the sec- 

 tion made along the Big Conewago creek yielded a fragment of a 

 tooth with serrated edges. An extensive search failed to uncover 

 additional fossil remains, but further search may be productive. 



Locality: Conglomerate, Big Conewago (loc. 2). 



TRACKS. 



Reptilian footprints have been reported from the Trias of York 

 County. 17 Two new localities have produced small tracks on thinly 

 bedded micaceous sandstone. These differ from any previously 

 described from this region. They can be referred to three types. 



One consists of two parallel rows of crescent-shaped impressions 

 with the longer diameter at right angles to the trend of the trail. 

 Spread of track 10 mm. and average distance between successive 

 footprints, 4 mm. (fig. 4, no. 1).

The second type consists of indistinct, circular tracks. The dis- 

 tance between successive imprints is 15 mm. Running parallel 

 on the same slab, 90 mm. distant, is a similar series; the two are 

 probably associated. Their rounded outlines indicate that these 

 trails were made under water by a creature either wading or swim- 

 ming (fig. 4, no. 2). 



The third type consists of three related impressions, similarly 

 placed. The distance between impressions is 30 mm. The lack 

 of distinctness prevents a more detailed description. From their 

 appearance they were evidently produced under water (fig. 4, no. 3).

MOLLUSKS. 



Shells and casts of different Mollusca were found. Some of them 

 evidently represent new species. Since the literature on the Tri- 

 assic fresh-water Mollusca is meager, it was considered desirable 

 that these specimens should be identified and described by an 

 authority. In consonance with this decision, they were referred 

 to Dr. H. A. Pilsbry, whose report follows. 



The Mollusca so far found belong to the fresh-water families 

 Unionidae and Mutelidae. Species of the former family have been 

 described from the Trias of the Dockum beds of the Staked Plains

of Texas by C. T. Simpson,^ and from the Connecticut Valley by 

 Emerson and Troxell. 19 All of these authors referred their species 

 to the northern genus Unio; but Simpson subsequently 20 decided 

 that at least part of the Texan species were related to South Amer- 

 ican genera, though he did not expressly alter the generic references. 

 A list of American Triassic species follows : 



Species from the Dockum beds, Staked Plains of Texas: Unio 

 subplanatus, Unio dumblei, Unio graciliratus, Unio dockumensis, all 

 of Simpson. 



Species from Trias of the Connecticut Valley: Unio emersoni 

 Troxell, Unio wilbrahamensis Emerson. 



The third and fourth species, at least, might better be referred 

 to the genus Diplodon, having radial beak sculpture. Probably 

 the others will also prove to have similar sculpture when material 

 sufficiently well preserved comes to hand. 



In three of the York species the radial sculpture of the beaks 

 shows relationship with South American genera, being like that of 

 Diplodon and Hyria, and totally unlike that of Unio and allied 

 genera of the Northern Hemisphere. These species are herein re- 

 ferred to the genus Diplodon. In two other York species the beaks 

 themselves are not preserved well enough to make out their sculp- 

 ture; but as there is corrugation of the posterior slope, it is likely 

 that the beaks are radially folded and that these also are referable 

 to Diplodon. 



The genus Mycetopoda, here recognized as a Mesozoic fossil for 

 the first time, is a South American genus belonging to the Mutelidae, 

 a family of the southern continents. 



The records for Triassic Unionidae are as yet few; but the wide 

 separation of the localities, the presence of several species and 

 their considerable diversity in shape and sculpture in each area, 

 may permit the inference that Triassic North America possessed 

 a large and varied Naiad fauna of South American type, Hyriinae 

 and Mutelidae. The next fauna of these mussels of which we have 

 any definite knowledge is that of the Jurassic in Colorado and Wyo- 

 ming. Here the South American types have entirely disappeared, 

 and in their place are distinctively Holarctic Unioninae, in which

the beak sculpture when known is of the concentric type. 21 These 

 were probably immigrants from Asia. Similar forms occur more 

 abundantly in the Laramie. 



Williston, from a study of the reptiles, holds that America was 

 isolated from the Old World throughout the Permian and well 

 into the Triassic, a broad connection being established in the Upper 

 Trias. 22 It appears likely that the subfamilies of Unionidse were 

 differentiated in this long interval from the Pennsylvanian to the 

 Trias, the Unioninse in Eurasia, while America had Hyriine mussels, 

 which disappeared with the. advent of Old World forms in Upper 

 Trias or Jurassic. The migration of Unionidse would doubtless 

 lag far behind that of reptiles after the connection was established. 



Diplodon pennsylvanicus n. sp. PL II, figs. 1 (type), 2, 3; pi. Ill, fig. 4. 



The type consists of the two valves of one individual, spread 

 open. On the same piece of hard gray shale there is another imper- 

 fect valve of the same species. 



The shell is oblong, not unlike a young Unio complanatus (Sol.) 

 in shape, being rather compressed. The beaks are at about the 

 anterior third. The posterior ridge is rounded, a radial depression 

 above it on the posterior slope. Sculpture of numerous folds radi- 

 ating from the beaks and reaching to about the middle of the valve 

 except posteriorly, where they are longer. Below the radial folds 

 there are some low, concentric wrinkles. 



Length 21 mm.; alt. 10.5 mm.; diam. about 6 mm. 



Locality: Shale, Little Conewago Creek (loc. 5). 



The specimen selected as type is not full grown, but the valves 

 are free from distortion, and the sculpture is finely preserved. Adult 

 shells, such as that shown in Plate III, figure 4, reach a length of 32 

 mm., alt. about 18 mm., diam. about 10 mm. The radial sculpture 

 covers a relatively smaller part of the valves, though actually about 

 the same area as in the type. 



Another specimen, obliquely compressed, is shown in dorsal aspect 

 in Plate II, fig. 2. Alt. about 20 mm. 



21 In some of the Laramie and later Uniones there are oblique folds, super- 

 ficially like those of Diplodon, as in Unio (Loxopleurus) belliplicatus Meek; 

 but on the beaks the sculpture is concentric. Certain Uniones described by 

 Whitfield, Bull. Amer. Mus. N. H., XIX and XXIII, from the Montana Laramie, 

 have sculpture recalling Diplodon, but more like the Asiatic Parreysia. They 

 form, I think, a special group, near Parreysia or a subgenus thereof, which may 

 be called Proparreysia, the type being Unio percorrugata Whitfield. 



22 This connection is usually mapped as across the North Atlantic (see Arldt, 

 Handbuch der Palaeogeographie, I, 1919); but it may have been in the north- 

 west.

The interior of a left valve (Plate II, fig. 3) shows a moderately- 

 deep beak cavity. The muscle scars are indistinct, but so far as 

 visible seem as in Unio. The pseudocardinal teeth are moderately 

 strong, double, nearly smooth. The single blade-like lateral tooth 

 is well developed but short, and rather widely separated from the 

 pseudocardinals. This shell was 32 or 33 mm. long. 



This is the most abundant species; remains of some 14 individuals 

 have been found. 



This species appears to be related to Unio dockumensis Simpson, 

 from the Trias of Garza County, Texas, having similar though more 

 extensive radial corrugation. That shell is about double the size 

 of pennsylvanicus. 



Diplodon borealis n. sp. Figs. 5, a, b, c. 



Three specimens represent a species resembling D. pennsylvanicus, 

 but plumper, smaller (if these are of full growth), with the beaks 

 nearer the middle, at about the anterior two-fifths of the length. 



b c 



Fig. 5. â€” Diplodon borealis n. sp. 



The sculpture consists of rather widely spaced radial furrows, much 

 narrower than their intervals, which are flattened and show irregular 

 weakly festooned concentric wrinkles in places. At the anterior 

 and posterior ends the radii are finer, and have the form of corru- 

 gations. The best preserved specimen measures: 



Length 14.5 mm., alt. 8.5 mm., diam. 7.3 mm. (fig. 5a). 



Another distorted shell is 20 mm. long (fig. 5b). This is also about 

 the length of the third specimen, in which one valve is partially 

 imbedded in hard shale, and the other somewhat compressed towards 

 the base (fig. 5c). 



Locality: Gray shale, Little Conewago Creek (loc. 5).

Diplodon wanneri n. sp. Plate III, flg. 5. 



The shell is oblong, compressed, with small beaks, but little pro- 

 jecting, at about the anterior fourth of the length. The dorsal 

 outline is moderately arched ; anterior end evenly rounded, posterior 

 end somewhat oblique, rounded; basal margin straightened. The 

 posterior ridge is prominent but rounded. Surface is smooth, ex- 

 cept for unequal wrinkles of growth. There is a gray-white cal- 

 careous layer about the thickness of writing paper, covering the 

 shell like a periostracum (broken away in places). The interior 

 is unknown. 



Length 37 mm.; alt. 22 mm.; diam. 11.7 mm. 



No traces of beak sculpture are discernible in the type specimen, 

 which, as mentioned above, is covered with a thin layer of calcite. 

 A much flattened specimen shows the beak sculpture (fig. 6) . There 

 are fine corrugations diverging from the posterior ridge, gradually 

 weakening, and finally disappearing about 17 mm. from the beak. 

 In the median part of the valve the fine corrugations radiating

from the beaks are gently curved towards the middle, though only 

 a few -of them meet (Hyria fashion). The branching of the corru- 

 gations produces some faint appearance of zigzag pattern in the 

 middle. In this region the sculpture reaches only about three or 

 four mm. from the beaks. Total length of this shell is about 33 mm. 

 Locality: Shale, Little Conewago Creek (loc. 5). 



Diplodon carolus-simpsoni n. sp. Plate II, figs. 4, 5, 6. 



The type is a left valve, imperfect in the anterior-basal region, 

 with part of the right valve almost wholly imbedded in the hard, 

 dark gray shale. 



The shell is oblong, plump, rather thick (1.6 mm. at about the 

 posterior third). The beaks are full and prominent, near the an- 

 terior end, which is rounded. Posterior end is oblique, being pro- 

 duced at the post-basal extremity. The posterior ridge is prominent 

 and rounded. Sculpture of rather strongly marked lines and wrinkles

of growth, and on the posterior ridge, radiating, fine folds; dorsad 

 of the ridge, on the posterior slope, the folds form a dorsally curved 

 corrugation. The ligament is strong and prominent. 



Length 34 mm. ; alt. 22 mm. ; diam. 19 mm. 



Another specimen (Plate II, fig. 6) from the same locality, but 

 from a different bed, is in the conglomerate of a deep brownish 

 drab color. As usual in this rock, the surface is not well preserved, 

 but the outlines are perfect. The corrugation of the posterior slope, 

 distinct in the type, is not legible. It measures: 



Length 45.5 mm.; alt. 25 mm.; semi-diam. 9.5 mm. 



In outline, this species resembles Unio graciliratus Simpson of the 

 Dockum beds, Dickens County, Texas; but in that shell the lira- 

 tions of the posterior slope appear to run parallel to the posterior 

 ridge, not diverging upwards towards the ligament, as in the Penn- 

 sylvanian species; also they continue to the posterior end, while in 

 our species the corrugated area is much less extended. 



It is named in honor of Mr. Charles T. Simpson, whose work 

 initiated the modern classification of Unionidae. 



Locality: Shale, Little Conewago Creek (loc. 5). 



Diplodon yorkensis n. sp. Plate III, figs. 2, 2a. 



The type is a nearly perfect specimen showing nothing suggesting 

 distortion of the original form. 



The shell is long, narrow and plump, the diameter and altitude 

 about equal. The moderately full beaks are about 28 per cent, of 

 the length from the anterior end, which is rounded. The posterior 

 end slopes obliquely, the posterior-basal angle being produced. 

 The posterior ridge is prominent, rounded, the basal margin straight, 

 the middle of the valves flat. The surface shows rather strong, 

 unequal wrinkles of growth where best preserved. On the dorsal 

 slope there appears to be some trace of fine, curved, radial corru- 

 gation posterior of the beaks. 



Length 32 mm.; alt. 11.5 mm.; diam. 11.7 mm. 



This species is quite distinct by its long, plump shape. Since 

 the above account was written a second specimen has been found. 

 In this the valves are spread partly open. Each shows a depression 

 running from the beaks obliquely downward and backward to the 

 basal margin. There are radial riblets on the beaks, though mostly 

 obliterated, and a fine corrugation on the dorsal slope behind the 

 beaks, the corrugations radiating from the posterior ridge and curv- 

 ing towards the dorsal margin, thus confirming the indistinct traces 

 of such sculpture shown by the type specimen. This shell is larger 

 than the type, 40 mm. long, and similar in other proportions. 



Locality: Shale, Little Conewago Creek (loc. 5). 




36 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Part I 



Mycetopoda diluculi n. sp. Plate III, flg. 1. 



The single example is imbedded in reddish shale, showing part 

 of one side and a section, from presumably near the anterior end, 

 which is broken away. 



The shell is quite compressed, apparently rather thin, of long, 

 narrow, straight form. The surface shows distinct wrinkles of 

 growth, which by their outlines indicate a rather strongly tapering 

 posterior end. 



The length of the part preserved is 99 mm. Alt. at broken end 

 30 mm.; further back, where the ventral margin is visible, the alt. 

 is about 25 mm. Diam. at broken end 9.5 mm. 



Mycetopoda is a recent genus of South America, with a few species 

 as far north as Nicaragua and Guatemala. While the generic refer- 

 ence of the fossil is not positive, the interior being unknown, its 

 characters, so far as they are legible, agree well with Mycetopoda, 

 and appear to indicate this genus or one closely similar. 



Locality: Shale, Little Conewago Creek (loc. 5). 



POLYCHAETA. 



Spirorbis inexpectatus n. sp. Plate III, flg. 3. 



In the "red" (deep brownish drab) shale there are small, spiral 

 bodies resembling the tubes of Spirorbis. They occur in groups 

 scattered on surfaces of uncertain nature, or sometimes shells. They 

 occur about half immersed in the matrix, or somewhat deeper. 



The spiral is in one plane. The largest individuals measure 

 2 mm. About one and a half turns seem to be present, but only 

 the last is clearly seen. This increases in width rather slowly, 

 always in clockwise direction. The surface of the spiral shows 

 sculpture of weak, retractively radial folds on the lateral convexity, 

 and there are also fine striae in the same direction. The tube appears 

 to be oval in section, its periphery rounded. 



From the uniform direction of coil it appears that the same side 

 is always exposed, the under side probably being attached. 



Locality: Shale, Little Conewago Creek (loc. 5). 



Feeling some uncertainty about these fossils a specimen was 

 submitted to Dr. John M. Clarke, who reported as follows: 



"I think there is little doubt that the specimen you have sent 

 to me is Spirorbis. These tube-secreting worms show themselves 

 to have been highly adaptable throughout Mesozoic and Paleozoic 

 history. In the Carboniferous their tubes cover the leaves of coal 

 plants and they are not unknown to us attached to terrestrial water- 

 carried plants of the Devonian. 



"This specimen before me carries the impression of a leaf or the 

 interior of some thin-shelled mollusk which might well have been

NEW OR LITTLE-KNOWN CRANE-FLIES FROM THE AMAZONIAN REGION. 



BY CHARLES P. ALEXANDER. 



The crane-flies that inhabit the vast extent of the Amazonian 

 basin are, unfortunately, still very insufficiently known. The pi- 

 oneer collecting of Henry W. Bates has been supplemented in recent 

 years principally by the work of Herbert S. Parish, whose two trips, 

 in 1912 and in 1919-1920, have given us almost our sole knowledge 

 of this remarkable fauna. The crane-flies collected on Parish's 

 first trip have been recorded by the writer in other papers (1912- 

 1914) that are cited in the bibliography at the end of the paper. 

 The material secured on the second and more extended excursion 

 has been discussed in part in three short papers by the writer (1920). 

 Most of the new species secured on this trip, especially in the terri- 

 tory of the Upper Amazons, are reserved for consideration in the 

 present paper. In order to complete the report, the comparatively 

 few and scattered records of Amazonian Tipuloidea described in 

 other papers are included herein. The types are in the collection 

 of the writer; and paratypes of many of the species in the collection 

 of the American Entomological Society. 



Mr. Parish has kindly supplied the writer with a brief account 

 of his trip which is recorded here to give a clear idea of the itinerary 

 of the 1919-1920 excursion: 



"I left New York on the 25th of May, 1919, and after a pleasant 

 voyage of fourteen days arrived off the Brazilian coast. * * * 

 The first place which I was to visit was the city of Para, situated 

 175 miles up the Para River, one of the tributaries of the Amazon. 

 Para or Belem is one of the finest cities in the tropics. Its parks 

 and buildings are strictly up-to-date and it also boasts of having 

 a completely equipped electric car-line. A branch of this line runs 

 out to Waterworks, the first place where I collected on this trip. 

 Here in the dense woods that surround the waterworks, and for 

 miles around in this district, I collected many different species of 

 insects, including numerous crane-flies. After remaining in this 

 place for ten days, I travelled by railroad eastward to Igarape- 

 Assii and Prat a, where the collecting proved excellent, but great 

 numbers of the insects collected were destroyed by ants and mold 

 caused by the damp climate. From here I continued up the Ama- 

 zon, my next stop being Santarem, about 400 miles from the coast. 

 The forest here was scanty and the insects correspondingly scarce,

so I remained for only three days. The next stage of the journey 

 was on a river steamer travelling to Obidos (Obydos, Bates). On 

 board the steamer I was able to collect numbers of insects around 

 the electric lights. The thick forest around Obidos is rich in game 

 and insects are plentiful. It is what might be called a "Natural- 

 ist's Paradise." Here the largest of its genus, a tree-top flyer, 

 Morpho hecuba, is found. To offset the pleasures of this paradise, 

 mosquitoes are extremely bad both day and night. I left Obidos, 

 travelling by night about 150 miles up the Trombetas River to a 

 village called Oximinia, a small place with about 600 people, situ- 

 ated on the edge of the forest. This place is very secluded and 

 rarely visited by naturalists. After ten days of good collecting I 

 returned to Obidos. From Obidos I continued my way up the 

 Amazon to Parintins and thence to the town of Itacoatiara (Ita- 

 coatiara or Serpa, Bates). I remained there for three weeks and 

 then pushed on to Manaos (Barra or Manaos, Bates), a beautiful 

 city situated on a hill. After collecting about the outskirts of this 

 city for a few days, I moved on to a place called Flores, about ten 

 miles out from Manaos on the electric line. Here I was successful in 

 making a large catch of insects, many being new to science. 



Teffe (Ega, Bates), about 300 miles up the Solimoes River, an- 

 other of the main tributaries of the Amazon, was my next objective. 

 The settlement here seemed to be almost the same as when Bates 

 was here over sixty years ago, excepting the fine brick building 

 erected by the Roman Catholics as a residence for their priests. 

 The most striking thing to me was the luxuriance of the vegetation 

 around Teffe Lake and the abundance of Micro-Lepidoptera and 

 Diptera. While at Teffe I managed to ward off a severe attack of 

 malaria which was threatening me. I stayed in this vicinity for 

 two months and then boarded the steamer "Belem," travelling 

 further up the Solimoes to Iquitos, in the Peruvian Department of 

 Loreto. This trip required ten days. While on board the steamer 

 I was able to catch a number of inseets attracted to the electric 

 lights at night. Landing at Iquitos, I found it to be a large, up-to- 

 date city, not very far behind our northern cities. The forest about 

 the place proved excellent for collecting. One day while walking 

 in the forest, I noticed a hole in the side of a bank, apparently the 

 entrance of some animal's burrow. By swishing my net about 

 the entrance, I caught four or five crane-flies and later on found 

 the same occurrence, the crane-flies representing one or two spe- 

 cies. At this place, crane-flies were noted in numbers swarming 

 in the sunlight. After two weeks' time, I caught a steam launch 

 that plies between this place and Yurimaguas on the Huallaga 

 River, a distance of some 550 to 600 miles. Here I lived with an 

 Indian family who were very hospitable. Looming up in the west 

 I could see the Andes Mountains. I procured a guide through my 

 Indian host and took a walk into the forest. The air here seemed 

 much fresher than that of the low-lying regions of the Amazonian 

 Basin. I remained at Yurimaguas for about a month and then

returned to Iquitos. Here I accepted the invitation to accompany 

 a prospector who was going up the Napo River. We left Iquitos 

 at about three o'clock one afternoon in a small canoe. Our party 

 consisted of five, including the Indian paddlers. The first night, 

 after supper, I got out my collecting apparatus, consisting of a white 

 sheet, lamp, cyanide bottles and net, and after fixing the sheet and 

 lighting the lamp, I was ready for the insects. They started to 

 come in twos and threes, but in about ten minutes they came so 

 fast that I had to call my prospector friend to my assistance. Even 

 then they were in such numbers that we could not get them all. 

 It took me all of the next day to pin and paper this material. Each 

 succeeding night while on the Napo River, I was able to add numer- 

 ous specimens to my collection. The animal life, especially the 

 birds and fishes, was extremely abundant. I was very sorry when 

 the time came to leave this place and return to Iquitos. From 

 here I caught the river steamer down the Amazon and returned 

 to Canada after an absence of more than a year." 



The Facies of the Amazonian Tipulid Fauna. 



The known Amazonian crane-flies represent a comparatively large 

 number of species distributed in a few relatively large genera. The 

 tribes and subfamilies of the Tipulidae found here are the Limno- 

 biini, Hexatomini, Eriopterini and Tipulinae. The families Tany- 

 deridae, Ptychopteridae and Rhyphidae, and the Pediciini and 

 Cylindrotominae of the Tipulidae, have not been discovered in 

 Amazonian territory. The following genera are comparatively well 

 represented in number of species: Dicranomyia, Geranomyia, Rhi- 

 yidia, Gonomyia, Erioptera, Gnophomyia, Trentepohlia, Psaronius, 

 Polymera, Ozodicera and Brachypremna. Other genera that are 

 very characteristic of this general region, although more scantily 

 represented in number of species, are as follows: Rhamphidia, 

 Diotrepha, Ceratocheilus, Toxorhina and Lecteria. The following 

 genera and subgenera appear to be confined to the Amazonian 

 and Guianian sub-regions: Molophilus (Eumolophilus) , Ctenolim- 

 nophila, and Microtipula. A few genera in the Amazonian region 

 have been taken as yet only on the Upper Amazons in Peruvian 

 territory; these are as follows: Elephantomyia, Cryptolabis and 

 Orimarga.

 lobe that is provided with a few long bristles; the inner or apical 

 pleural appendage is large, roughly triangular, the cephalic angle 

 produced into a conspicuous claw-like hook; along the caudal mar- 

 gin there is a comb of about 30 slender teeth; proximal face of this 

 lobe produced into a short, blunt, blackened lobe. On the proximal 

 face of the pleurite near the base is a short cylindrical lobe capped

Generally similar to D. egae sp. n., differing as follows: Size 

 smaller. Praescutal stripes confluent as in egae. Wings a little 

 broader, more grayish than brown, with the stigma more clearly 

 defined, oval, brown; Sc shorter, cell 1st M 2 longer and narrower.

 bristles at the apex; immediately caudad of this is a smaller lobe, 

 paler, with the bristles of proportionately equal length. Near mid- 

 length of the proximal face of the pleurite is a small cylindrical 

 lobe bearing two very powerful flattened bristles or fascicles of 

 bristles ; at the base of this lobe is a larger one with a powerful bristle 

 at its tip, the apex with abundant smaller bristles. The pleural 

 appendage has the comb-like teeth very irregular in size and dis-

 fringed with bristles along the cephalic face; the caudal face bears 

 near midlength a tubercle tipped with two long bristles. Ventral 

 pleural appendage fleshy, the proximal face produced inward as a 

 yellow, slightly curved arm that bears two slender spines beyond 

 midlength on the caudal face, these spines with the tips squarely

The only described species with which the present form agrees 

 at all is D. concinna Williston. Mr. F. W. Edwards, of the British 

 Museum, has compared a paratype of the present species with 

 Williston's types of D. concinna and reports the differences as follows: 



"D. concinna: Thorax light brown. Wings clear (legs missing). 

 Palpi longer. Wings narrower, especially cell Sc. Crossvein sc 

 (Set) beyond the tip of Sc, in one specimen another crossvein in 

 cell Sc beyond the first. Rs half as long again as Ri+ 3 , hence all 

 apical cells very short. Cui a (basal deflection of Cui) nearer base 

 of wing, at a distance about equal to R 2 + 3 before base of Rs. 



" D. fumicosta: Thorax darker brown. Wings with broad brown 

 margin on apical part of costa. Palpi shorter. Wings rather 

 broader. Crossvein sc just before tip of Sc. Rs a little shorter 

 than .R2+3, apical cells longer than in above. Distance of Cui a 

 from base of Rs equal to less than half of 122+3." â€” F. W. Edwards.

 costa do not agree in all particulars with the specimen described by- 

 Mr. Edwards, yet they are in so close agreement that practically 

 all of the distinctions indicated hold throughout the series. 



Genus ATARBA Osten Sacken. 

 1869. Atarba Osten Sacken, Mon. Dipt. N. Amer., part 4, pp. 127, 128. 



Atarba is a.rather small genus of crane-flies that reaches its great- 

 est specific development in the tropics of the New World. The 

 genus has been referred to the old tribe Antochini but the presence 

 of tibial spurs in the typical forms would indicate that the present 

 reference is more nearly correct despite the reduced venation. 



Atarba megaphallus sp. n. 



Antennae of the male elongate; flagellum dark brown, both ends of 

 each segment narrowly pale; wings grayish yellow; Rs short, cell 

 1st Mi small; male hypopygium with the penis-guard greatly en- 

 larged, the apex widened into a hood-shaped structure. 



Male. â€” Length 5-5.5 mm.; wing 5-5.8 mm. 

 Female. â€” Length 6.5 mm. ; wing 6.2 mm. 



Rostrum brownish yellow. Antennae of the male elongated, 

 longer than 2 one-half the body; scapal segments brownish yellow; 

 first flagellar segment pale brown, passing into dark brown before 

 the tip, the extreme apex pale; remaining flagellar segments dark 

 brown, the extreme base and apex of each segment pale to produce 

 a narrowly annulated appearance; flagellar segments elongate- 

 cylindrical, clothed with an abundant erect white pubescence and 

 provided with a few verticils arranged unilaterally. Head pale 

 brownish yellow. Mesonotum pale brownish yellow, the prae- 

 scutum without markings. Pleura brown, fading into yellow on the 

 sternum. Halteres pale brown, the knobs dark brown. Legs with 

 the coxae and trochanters obscure yellow; femora obscure yellow- 

 ish, the extreme tips indistinctly darker; remainder of the legs 

 brownish yellow, only the terminal tarsal segments darker brown. 

 Wings with a strong grayish yellow tinge, the stigmal region indis- 

 tinctly darker; veins pale brownish yellow. Venation: Sc short, 

 Sci ending just beyond the origin of Rs; *Sc 2 some distance from 

 the tip of Sci, the latter alone being nearly equal to the short sector; 

 Rs short, but little longer than the deflection of Rt + f,; Rz+ 3 almost 

 straight, running rather close to R x ; cell Ri much narrower than 

 R 3 at the wing-margin; cell 1st M 2 very small, pentagonal; basal 

 deflection of Ctii beyond the fork of M. Abdominal tergites obscure 

 yellowish brown; sternites clearer yellow; in the male a conspicuous 

 subterminal blackish ring on segments five and six, hypopygium 

 obscure yellow. Male hypopygium with the pleurites and append- 

 ages about as in the other species of the genus; penis-guard greatly 

 enlarged, the apex widened and concave above, hood-like.

Genus ELEPHANTOMYIA Osten Sacken. 

 1859. Elephantomyia Osten Sacken, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., p. 220. 



The genus Elephantomyia has long been referred. to the tribe 

 Antochini and later to the Eriopterini. The presence of distinct 

 tibial spurs would indicate that this genus, like Atarba, is an aberrant 

 hexatomine form. 



Elephantomyia supernumeraria sp. n. 



General coloration dark brown; thoracic pleura gray pruinose 

 with two narrow dark brown longitudinal stripes; legs black; wings 

 subhyaline with a heavy brown pattern; a supernumerary cross- 

 vein near the outer end of cell R 2 . 



Male. â€” Length (excluding rostrum) about 5.4 mm.; wing 5.8 mm.; 

 rostrum about 3.9 mm. 



Rostrum long and slender, dark brown. Antennae dark brown; 

 verticils elongate. Head gray. Mesonotum dark brown. Pleura 

 pale brown, sparsely pruinose, with two narrow dark brown longi- 

 tudinal stripes, the dorsal stripe beginning at the cervical sclerites, 

 extending beneath the wing-root; the ventral stripe begins on the 

 mesosternum before the middle coxa, passing beneath the halter to 

 the base of the abdomen. Halteres yellow, the knobs infuscated. 

 Legs with the fore and middle coxae infuscated; posterior coxae 

 less darkened; trochanters obscure yellow,the margin with a brown 

 spot; remainder of the legs black, the bases of the femora narrowly 

 pale; the joint between the femur and tibia is narrowly and indis- 

 tinctly pale. Wings subhyaline with a heavy and conspicuous 

 brown pattern, distributed as follows: At arculus; a large area at 

 the origin of Rs, extending caudad to vein M; a small spot at the tip 

 of Sci; a conspicuous seam at the stigma, continued along the cord 

 to the fork of M; rounded spots at the tips of veins Ri and R 2 , the 

 latter extending onto the supernumerary crossvein in cell R 2 ; wing- 

 tip infumed; brownish seams along the outer end of cell 1st M 2 and 

 the basal deflection of Cui; veins light brown, slightly darker in the 

 infuscated areas. Venation: Sc long, Sc t extending to about oppo- 

 site four-fifths the long Rs; Rs strongly arcuated at origin; R t 

 very short, a little less than m; a supernumerary crossvein in cell R 2 

 near its outer end, the tip of vein R 2 beyond it pale and without 

 macrotrichiae ; cell 1st M 2 large, rectangular, about as long as as a 

 little shorter than vein Mi+ 2 beyond it; basal deflection of Cui at 

 or beyond midlength of cell 1st M 2 , a little longer than Cu 2 . Abdo- 

 men dark brown, the base of the hypopygium a little brighter. 

 Male hypopygium with the two pleural appendages subequal in

length, the outer appendage more slender, at the tip split into two 

 short, subequal points. 



Habitat. â€” Peru. 



Holotype, cf , Napo River, June 8, 1920 (H. S. Parish). 



Paratopotype, <?. 



Elephantomyia supernumeraria is distinguished from all the de- 

 scribed American species of the genus by the heavily patterned wings 

 and from all known species of the genus by the presence of a super- 

 numerary cross vein in cell R 2 of the wings. 



CTENOLTMNOPHILA gen. n. 



Antennae with sixteen segments, the flagellar segments short- 

 cylindrical. Tibiae provided with spurs. Wings with Sc t at the 

 tip of Sc u - a supernumerary crossvein in cell R 2 ; cell 1st M* very 

 long and narrow, irregular in outline, approximately twice as long 

 as the cells beyond it; cell Mi lacking. Male hypopygium with 

 the outer pleural appendage provided with very long, appressed 

 teeth on the outer face before the tip. 



Genotype. â€” Ctenolimnophila bivena, sp. n. (Amazonian Region). 



The general appearance of the two species now known to belong 

 to this genus is much more like a Gnophomyia than a Limnophiline 

 form. Gnophomyia decisa Alexander, described from imperfect ma- 

 terial, is now known to be a member of this genus. The tibial spurs 

 in C. decisa are much shorter and stouter than in C. bivena. The 

 type of hypopygium is strongly suggestive of Ephelia and Atarba. 

 Ctenolimnophila bivena sp. n.- 



Male. â€” Length 4.5 mm.; wing 4.8-5.3 mm. 



Generally similar to C. decisa but differing in several important 

 details. The general coloration is dark brown, the legs conspicu- 

 ously light yellow. The hairs of the legs are longer and more out- 

 spreading than in decisa. The principal differences between the 

 two forms are found in the wings, as follows: 



Wings with a supernumerary crossvein in cell R 3 in addition to 

 the one in cell R 2 , the former lying a short distance proximad of 

 the latter. Wings more uniformly darkened, the radial cells uni- 

 formly dark brown, the cubital and anal cells grayish brown; narrow 

 seams and spots at the origin of Rs, along the cord, outer end of 

 cell 1st M% and the supernumerary crossveins darker brown; no in- 

 dications of the three pale spots along the costal margin as in decisa; 

 the only pale areas on the wing are the centers of cells 1st Mt, 2nd 

 Mi, M 3 and a faint wash before the cord in the end of cell R.

Genus ERIOPTERA Meigen. 

 1803. Erioptera Meigen, Illiger's Mag., Bd. 2, p. 262. 



Species of the genus Erioptera are relatively abundant in the 

 Amazonian Region. Many of these species belong to the subgenus 

 Mesocyphona which reaches its greatest specific development in the 

 Tropics of the New World. A few other forms belong to the typical 

 subgenus .Erioptera, although the species of the annulipes group 

 must be considered as being somewhat aberrant.

The type female was from Prata, Brazil, June 30, 1919 (H. S. 

 Parish). A male specimen was taken by Parish at Yurimaguas, 

 Peru, April 17, 1920, and is herewith described as the allotype. 



Allotype. â€” Male, length about 2.5 mm.; wing 2.5 mm. 



Similar to the type female. Male hypopygium (Plate IV, fig. 8) 

 with the pleurites comparatively large and stout ; two pleural append- 

 ages, the outer one deeply bifid, the outer branch a slender chitinized 

 spine, the inner branch shorter, stout, the apex a little enlarged 

 and covered with minute spinules; inner pleural appendage a flat- 

 tened arm whose apex is obtusely rounded and provided with a 

 few tiny setae. Gonapophyses very large and powerful, about as 

 long as the pleurites themselves, each apophyse appearing as a 

 blackened blade directed caudad, the acute tips curved proximad 

 and subcontiguous with one another at the midline of the body; 

 before the tip on the proximal face, each apophyse is dilated into 

 a thin, flaring blade whose margin is weakly serrate.

 Edwards thinks that the two forms are probably specifically the 

 same, an opinion in which the writer concurs. 



Erioptera (Erioptera) apicialba sp. n.

The type is badly eaten by ants. The species is related to E- 

 annulipes Williston, differing as follows: General coloration much 

 darker. Mesonotal praescutum dark gray with a broad brownish 

 median stripe that is narrowly divided by a pale line, the tuber- 

 culate pits lying one on either margin of this pale line; a small ob- 

 scure yellow area before the pseudosutural foveae; margin of the 

 praescutum narrowly whitish. Pleura dark brown; a narrow, but 

 conspicuous, ventral silvery white longitudinal stripe extending 

 from behind the fore coxae to the base of the abdomen; above the 

 hind coxae a much abbreviated similar stripe lying parallel with the 

 first; sternum heavily gray pruinose; dorso-pleural membranes sul- 

 phur yellow. Legs with the trochanters brown; tibiae with three 

 black bands, on the middle legs these being much broader than the 

 pale interspaces, on the posterior legs as wide as or narrower than 

 the interspaces. Wings with a uniform gray tinge; an indistinct 

 whitish suffusion across the disk in the region of the cord; the costal 

 margin, including cells C and Sc, white, interrupted by three small 

 dark brown spots, one each at the tips of Sc h Ri and R if these dark 

 areas being smaller than the interspaces; the entire wing-apex is 

 broadly white excepting a narrow seam along vein R t +& which 

 continues almost to the margin; rounded white spots in the ends of 

 cells 2nd R lf M 3 , Cui and Cu; veins dark brown, paler in the hya-

Genus MOLOPHILUS Curtis 

 1833. Molophilus Curtis, Brit. Ent., p. 444. 



EUMOLOPHILUS subgen. n. 



Generally similar to Molophilus, differing as follows: The tibiae 

 and metatarsi of the hind legs in both sexes are adorned with con- 

 spicuous erect fringes of long, dark hairs that give to the legs a 

 fan-like appearance. Male hypopygium with a conspicuous lyri- 

 form plate. 



Type of the subgenus. â€” Molophilus (Eumolophilus) thaumastopodus 

 Alexander (Brazil). 



This subgeneric group is proposed for two species of Amazonian 

 crane-flies that present a remarkable appearance, due to the con- 

 spicuous trichiation of the legs, especially the posterior tibiae and 

 metatarsi. The general appearance of the flies is not unlike that of 

 certain species of the Culicid genus Sabethes inhabiting this same 

 region. Although the general appearance of the two species referred 

 to this subgenus is very unlike typical Molophilus, the structural 

 details show the two groups to be closely allied. Besides the type 

 of the subgenus, the new species M. (E.) pennipes belongs to this 

 group. 



Molophilus (Eumolophilus) pennipes sp. n. 



Male. â€” Length about 5 mm. ; wing 4.5 mm. ; hind leg, femur, 4.9 

 mm.; tibia 3.9 mm. 



Female. â€” Length about 5 mm.; wing 4.8 mm.; hind leg, femur, 

 5.1 mm.; tibia 4.1 mm. 



Generally similar to M. (.E.) thaumastopodus Alexander, differing 

 as follows: size much larger as shown by the measurements. An-

tennae of the male elongate, bicolorous, the base and apex of each 

 flagellar segment pale, the middle portion of each segment provided 

 with long, conspicuous, outspreading hairs, very much as in males 

 of the genus Polymera. The oar-like brushes on the posterior legs 

 with conspicuous violaceous reflexions. Male hypopygium with the 

 lyriform plate small, the two arms powerful, divergent, the tips 

 incurved; a little more than the apical third of each arm is pro- 

 vided on the inner face with conspicuous erect spines, those toward 

 the tip more appressed; among these spines, at about two-thirds 

 the length of the arm is an extensive cushion of short, erect, bristle- 

 like spines. In M. thaumastopodus, the arms of the lyriform plate 

 are slender, directed caudad and laterad, with only the tips directed 

 a little proximad; these arms are entirely smooth with the exception 

 of four or five appressed spines at the very tip on the inner face; 

 there is no evidence of a cushion of shorter bristles.

Genus CRYPTOLABIS Osten Sacken. 

 1859. Cryplolabis Osten Sacken, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., p. 224. 

 Cryptolabis (Cryptolabis) tenuicincta sp. n. 



General coloration whitish testaceous, thoracic pleura with a 

 conspicuous brown longitudinal stripe; wings subhyaline with a 

 brown spot at the arculus and a narrow brown crossband at the 

 cord; cell M 3 very deep, extending basad almost to the fork of M, 

 an apparent m-cu cross vein being formed. 



Sexfâ€” Wing 4.2 mm. 



Head lacking in the unique type. Mesonotum pale whitish testa" 

 ceous, unmarked with darker. Pleura concolorous with the dor" 

 sum, the dorsal sclerites with a broad, dark brown, longitudina 1 

 stripe extending from the cervical sclerites to beneath the nxr 

 of the halteres. Halteres pale, the knobs broken. Legs with th e 

 coxae and trochanters whitish testaceous; femora and tibiae pale; 

 tarsi broken; femora and tibiae with conspicuous, erect, pale hairs. 

 Wings subhyaline; a brownish spot at the arculus; a narrow and 

 indistinct brownish seam along the cord, beginning as a faint double 

 marking on Rs and R 2 + 3 , continued caudad across the wing to the 

 posterior margin; veins pale, darker in the infuscated areas. Sparse

and Cui. Venation: Rs short, straight or feebly convex as in the 

 genus, cell 1st Ri consequently subtriangular as in C. paradoxa and 

 allies; Ri+ 3 a little more than one-half Rs; basal deflection of R* 

 perpendicular to Ri+ 3 , in alignment with r; basal deflection of 

 Ri+ b punctiform, almost in alignment with Rs; r-m long, about two- 

 thirds of Rs; cell M 3 very deep, vein M 3 originating basad of the 

 deflection of Cu h in all other species of the genus, vein M 3 arises 

 distad of the deflection of Cui and cell M$ is consequently petiolate; 

 in the present species, cell M 3 is entirely sessile; there thus appears 

 to be a long m-cu crossvein preserved that is about half as long as 

 the deflection of Cu x . Abdomen lacking. 



Habitat. â€” Peru. 



Holotype, Sex?, Yurimaguas, April 10, 1920 (H. S. Parish). 



Although the type specimen of this interesting new species of 

 Cryptolabis is badly eaten by Psocids, it is described in order to 

 present a new venational peculiarity in the tribe, the apparent re- 

 tention of the m-cu crossvein. The discovery of this fly lends sup- 

 port to Tillyard's theory of a four-branched media in the gener- 

 alized Diptera. By adopting this theory in the present instance, 

 the apparent m-cu crossvein becomes the basal section of Mi and 

 this would seem to be a far more logical interpretation than to 

 consider the element as being m-cu, since this is lacking in almost 

 every known Limnobiine crane-fly.

 pleural appendage fleshy, much larger than the chitinized append- 

 age, before the tip with a small acute spine, at the tip with two 

 powerful bristles; proximal face with about a dozen additional 

 bristles. 



Gonomyia (Leiponeura) acuminata sp. n. Plate IV, flg. 1.

 coxae obscure yellow, only slightly darkened basally; trochanters 

 obscure yellow; femora pale yellow with a narrow brown subter- 

 minal ring; the fore legs are broken but the femora are probably 

 dark brown as in this group of species ; tibiae and metatarsi yellow, 

 the tips narrowly infuscated; remainder of the tarsi dark brown. 

 Wings with a strong grayish tinge; cells C, Sc and most of R i china- 

 white; stigma oval, brownish gray; veins pale brown, the costa 

 china-white. Venation: Sci ending far before the origin of Rs, 

 this distance being greater than the length of Rs; Rs short, strongly 

 arcuated at origin; cell 1st M 2 open by the atrophy of the outer 

 deflection of M 3 ; basal deflection of Cui at the fork of M . Abdomen 

 dark brown, the tergites narrowly margined posteriorly with obscure 

 yellow, broader on the posterior segments; sternites more uniformly 

 brown. Male hypopygium (Plate IV, Fig. 1) with the pleurites 

 rather short and stout, shorter than the longest pleural appendage; 

 pleural appendages four in number ; the longest or ventral appendage 

 is a slender, slightly curved, chitinized arm that tapers gradually 

 to the rather blunt apex, near the base on the inner face with a 

 prominent, acute spine that is about two-fifths as long as the apical 

 point; the second appendage is an apical, elongate needle-like rod 

 directed proximad, tapering to the acute blackened point; third 

 appendage elongate-triangular, the apex a slightly curved black 

 spine; the fourth or dorsal appendage is a pale fleshy lobe, roughly 

 triangular in form, the apex produced into a cylindrical arm, this 

 arm and the proximal face of the appendage set with about seventeen 

 mostly powerful bristles. The penis-guard is a small, feebly chitin- 

 ized structure that is subtended by the much longer gonapophyses, 

 these appearing as two delicate setigerous cushions.

 dominal tergites brown, the sternites a little paler. Male hypo- 

 pygium (Plate IV, Fig. 7) with the pleurites long and slender, clothed 

 with erect bristles of which two or three on the outer distal end 

 are very long; a single pleural appendage, this roughly subcircular 

 in outline, entirely pale, the inner face produced proximad into

 pophyses the two longest are unequal in size, both blackened apic- 

 ally, elongate, flattened, with one margin serrulate; at the base of 

 these appendages is a small, powerful black tooth with numerous 

 plush-like hairs at its base. What appears to be projections of the 

 ninth tergite are cylindrical arms tipped with a palmate cluster of 

 about eight powerful spines, the more lateral of these shorter, gradu- 

 ally lengthening proximad, the innermost being replaced by abun- 

 dant long bristles. 



Habitat . â€” Peru . 



Holotype, d\ Iquitos, May 18, 1920 (H. S. Parish). 



Gonomyia phoroctenia, together with two other species described 

 at this time, G. ctenophora and G. crepuscula, form a group of three 

 very closely related species with the general body coloration very 

 similar but the details of structure of the male hypopygium strik- 

 ingly different. To these there should probably be added G. bi- 

 spinosa sp. n., although in this form there are two pleural append- 

 ages and the comb on the ninth tergite is reduced to a pad of deli- 

 cate appressed setae. 



Gonomyia (Leiponeura) ctenophora sp. n. Plate IV, fig. 6. 



Male. â€” Length about 3.8 mm.; wing 3.5 mm. 



Generally similar to G. (L.) phoroctenia sp. n., differing as follows: 

 Size slightly smaller. Scutellum even more brownish yellow behind. 

 Dorso-pleural membranes and pleural stripe brighter yellow. Wings 

 a little narrower and paler. Male hypopygium (Plate IV, Fig. 6) 

 with the pleurites long and slender, clothed with long bristles that 

 become longer toward the apex of the sclerite on the outer face; 

 a single pleural appendage, this roughly cylindrical in form with a 

 conspicuous blackened spine on the outer margin near midlength; 

 the narrowed cylindrical tip produced into a bristle or fascicle of 

 bristles; a few additional setae are grouped on this narrowed apex. 

 The penis-guard and gonapophyses are not as large or complicated 




82 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Part I 



in structure as in phoroctenia, there being two elongate, blade-like 

 structures that are blackened at their tips. The penis-guard itself 

 is flattened, the margin produced into an acicular spine; at the base 

 of the penis-guard is a small bottle-shaped appendage with the 

 neck heavily blackened. On the ninth tergite are two cylindrical 

 arms as in phoroctenia, these bearing a comb of six powerful curved 

 teeth, shortest proximally, gradually lengthening toward the out- 

 side; the outer lateral angles are replaced by long yellowish hairs. 

 In the slide mounts of phoroctenia these arms are directed cephalad 

 and the teeth are on the lateral side but this condition may be due 

 to torsion in mounting. The -figures show the hypopygia as they 

 appear on the slides.

 Sci ending a short distance before the origin of Rs; basal deflection 

 of Cui a short distance before the fork of M. Male hypopygium 

 (Plate IV, Figs. 5, 5A) with the pleurites long and slender, clothed 

 with bristles as in phoroctenia. A single pleural appendage, this 

 appearing as a short curved chitinized horn, the tips acute. Gona- 

 pophyses and penis-guard forming a complicated mass as in phoroc- 

 tenia, there being two elongate organs, one slightly bent at the 

 apex and heavily blackened, the second, which is presumably the 

 penis-guard, pale, narrowed to the acute tip. Besides these there 

 is a blackened flattened plate surrounding the penis-guard. The 

 general arrangement of teeth on the ninth tergite is here approxi- 

 mately as in phoroctenia and ctenophora but the number of teeth is 

 greatly reduced, there being but three or four of these, the outer- 

 most being very much more powerful than any of the others, the 

 inner angle clothed with delicate appressed hairs.

 Male hypopygium (Plate IV, Fig. 4, 4A) with the pleurites rela- 

 tively short and stout ; two pleural appendages borne at the extreme 

 apices of the pleurites; these appendages are very similar to one 

 another in general shape but the outer one is slightly larger than 

 the inner one. They appear as pale, cylindrical, gently curved 

 appendages, the tips suddenly narrowed into powerful blackened 

 spines; before the blackened tips with three or four small setae. 

 The penis-guard is relatively long and slender, tapering gradually 

 to the apex. The two patches of spines borne by G. phoroctenia

"T. manca (Williston). Thorax bright ochreous, almost orange. 

 Legs light brown. Wings with a suggestion of clouding along the 

 veins towards the apex and on the crossveins. R 2 longer and more 

 oblique, cell R t distinctly stalked; branches of Cu diverging at an 

 angle of about 150Â°; 2nd A longer, ending distinctly beyond the 

 anal angle; cell 2nd A broader. 



'T. extensa (Alexander). Thorax dull brown. Legs darker 

 brown. Wings clear except for stigma. Ri shorter; cell Rt sessile; 

 angle of Cu at most 120Â°; 2nd A shorter, ending at the barely per- 

 ceptible anal angle.

Genus TOXORHINA Loew. 

 1851. Toxorhina Loew, Linnaea Entomol., Bd. 5, p. 400. 



Toxorhina is a very characteristic genus in the Amazonian fauna. 

 There has been some attempt made to restrict the name Toxorhina 

 Loew to the species of the genus that we call Elephantomyia Osten 

 Sacken. The basis for this reference consists in a preliminary paper 

 (Bernst. und Bernst.-fauna, 1850) by Loew in which the genus 

 Toxorhina is briefly characterized and keyed and three species be- 

 longing to it are mentioned but not described. There are at least 

 three genera to which Loew's diagnosis would apply and his genus 

 would be unrecognizable were it not for a more detailed account 

 with figures that appeared in 1851, as cited above. In this paper, 

 in addition to the three amber species which are briefly discussed 

 and figured, there appears in this paper a full description, with many 

 figures, of the recent T. fragilis Loew of Porto Rico, which species 

 Coquillett selected as type of Toxorhina in 1910. In the opinion of 

 the writer, the 1850 name Toxorhina has no more status than the 

 famous 1800 names of Meigen, since it must depend entirely on the 

 1851 paper for its accurate diagnosis and recognition. If this latter 

 fact is admitted then there can be no valid objection against select- 

 ing any of the species included in this paper as type as was done 

 by Coquillett. Unless further and more convincing arguments are 

 brought forth, the writer will follow the generic concepts as advo- 

 cated by Osten Sacken and other later students of the Tipulidae. 



It has long been held that Elephantomyia and Toxorhina are 

 closely allied. The former genus possesses small but distinct tibial 

 spurs which appear to be quite lacking in the species of Toxorhina. 

 For the time being, at least, the writer is referring Toxorhina to the 

 Eriopterini. The discovery of the immature stages is very de- 

 sirable.

Holotype, 9 , Napo River, June 15, 1920 (H. S. Parish). 



Based on the structure of the female, the present insect must 

 be considered as being a race of armatipennis Alexander (Chapada, 

 Brazil) but the discovery of the male might result in giving the 

 form full specific rank. In typical armatipennis the flagellar seg- 

 ments are a little longer, there is no dark line on the vertex, the 

 thoracic coloration is more fulvous and the structure of the ovi- 

 positor is slightly different.

Tipula bezziana is a strikingly beautiful fly that is probably not 

 a true Tipula but there is no genus known to the writer that can 

 receive it. The very short frontal prolongation of the head, with- 

 out a nasus, is very like Nephrotoma, whereas the venation is some- 

 what suggestive of Brachypremna. The discovery of the male sex 

 will be of exceptional interest. It is with great pleasure that this 

 interesting species is dedicated to my friend, the distinguished 

 Dipterologist, Dr. Mario Bezzi.

Tipula plumbeithorax, like T. ejfeta, is an aberrant member of the

STUDIES ON SOME FLAGELLATA. 

 BY E. PENARD. 



While studying Infusoria, in the neighborhood of Geneva, 

 Switzerland, during the years 1914 to 1918, I often happened to 

 meet with particularly interesting Flagellata, and sometimes inter- 

 rupted my ordinary work to study some of these organisms. The 

 results of these investigations appear of sufficient interest for pub- 

 lication, and it is a particular pleasure for me to make them known 

 here. The species to be discussed are: Pteridomonas scherffeli 

 Lemm., Dimorpha tetramastix sp. n., Dimorpha monomastix sp. n. 

 Bicoeca exilis sp. n., Histiona campanula sp. n., Salpingoeca poly- 

 gonatum sp. n., Salpingoeca lepidula sp. n., Chrysamoeba radians 

 Klebs, Chrysopyxis bipes Stein, Hyalobryon ramosum Lauterborn, 

 Cryptomonas ovata Ehrenberg, Astasia mobilis (Rehberg) Alexieeff, 

 Euglena pseudomermis sp. n., Trentonia flagellata Stokes. 



Pteridomonas scherffeli Lemm Plate V, figs. 1-3. 



Though the description of the genus Pteridomonas dates back as 

 far as 1890 (Penard, 28), the first concise diagnosis which we possess 

 is due to Lemmermann (24), and I can do no better than to repro- 

 duce it here, at least in its most important points: 



Pterdomonas Petard. Cells naked, mostly stalked; 1 flagellum, 

 and rarely, besides, 2 slowly vibrating accessory flagella. At the 

 base of the flagellum, a crown of fine radiating pseudopodia. One 

 or two contractile vacuoles. Nucles with distrinct caryosom. 

 Multiplication unknown. Food taken by the pseudomopodia, or 

 by means of special food-vacuoles. Movement freely rotating, 

 swinging, or by sudden leaps backward, due to the contraction of 

 the stalk. 



As for Pteridomonas scherffeli, which was found by Scherffel in 

 Hungary, then by Lemmermann at Bremen, Germany, its specific 

 characters are indicated as follows: "Cells generally longer than 

 broad, in optical longitudinal section rounded with 5-6 angles. 

 Stalk long and fine. Nucleus near the base of the flagellum. Be- 

 sides the anterior crown of pseudopodia, some lateral radiating 

 pseudopodia." 



This Pteridomonas scherffeli was found in great quantities in 

 the month of September last (1918), among the decaying leaves 

 that filled the bottom of a pond, at the Ariana Park, near Geneva.

106 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART I 



I was then enabled to study this very interesting organism at some 

 length, and should like to discuss here some of the most important 

 points of its structure. 



Regarding the identity of my specimens: Lemmermann speaks 

 of "cells longer than broad, in optical longitudinal section rounded 

 with 5-6 angles," while in the Ariana specimens the breadth of 

 the body was normally at least equal, and very often superior, to 

 the length; and at the same time the anterior part was broader 

 than the posterior (Plate V, fig. 1); in optical longitudinal section 

 the form, rather than "rounded with 5-6 angles," was that of a 

 top with a truncated point. In short, this Ariana form was but 

 in a very general manner in accordance with Lemmermann's de- 

 scription; but as this very small organism is difficult to study, and 

 is perhaps subject to great variation in its shape, it seems best 

 at present to consider the two forms as representing the same or- 

 ganism. 



Pteridomonas in form, as we just said, is more or less that of a 

 top; the size is about 8-9[l, often rather less, and rarely more. In 

 the anterior part of the body we find, right and left, two small con- 

 tractile vesicles, and also, in the posterior part, two other vaculoes, 

 but of a special nature; the body, in fact, seems to be hollowed out 

 to form two small depressions, one at the left and the other at the 

 right, with a clear space or vacuole in the center; they hardly look 

 like contractile vesicles, especially -since these depressions are some- 

 times wanting, yet sometimes I have seen the vacuoles suddenly 

 collapsing, as contractile vesicles generally do. The flagellum, whose 

 length is equal to three or four times that of the body, is relatively 

 strong, and easily seen. From the middle of the anterior part of 

 the body, which is itself somewhat flattened or even excavated, 

 this flagellum points directly upwards during the first part of its course, 

 then curves right or left, and when vibrating becomes hardly visible. 

 At its point of fixation it is provided with a basal granule, very 

 small and mostly quite invisible, but which I could detect once on 

 a gradually and strongly compressed specimen. 



In Lemmermann's diagnosis we noted the following lines: "One 

 flagellum, and rarely besides, two slowly vibrating accessory fla- 

 gella. At the base of the flagellum, a crown of fine radiating pseu- 

 dopodia." We must treat at some length of these rather important 

 organs. 



The central flagellum is normally surrounded by a crown of very 

 fine threads, perhaps about one dozen in number, quite rigid and 

 motionless, which point straight into the surrounding liquid, at an 

 angle of about 45Â° from the central flagellum. These threads, 

 which have generally been described as pseudopodia, and indeed 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 107 



certainly appear to be such ; very often seem to start, not from a middle 

 region quite near the fiagellum, but further away from the middle, 

 even from near the extreme border of the body, like an anterior 

 crown above the equatorial girdle of setae which we shall soon 

 speak of. But it only appears so, and in fact one can easily see, 

 on specimens favorably oriented for such observations, that all the 

 threads of the crown have their origin in the immediate vicinity 

 of the central fiagellum. Sometimes, left and right of the fiagellum 

 are seen two much smaller flagella, slowly undulating, and quite 

 independent from the big central one. These two small accessory 

 flagella, whose meaning has not yet been understood, seem to have 

 been a great puzzle for those few observers who noticed them; but 

 more protracted observations, with adequate material, would have 

 allowed of more certain conclusions. In fact, there are not always 

 two accessory flagella, but sometimes one or two, or more; or, on 

 a specimen where none was at first detected, suddenly there may 

 be seen to appear a crown of small flagella, which begin vibrat- 

 ing, and after a very short time slowly retract, getting thicker 

 the more they shorten â€” as if an axial thread were retracting into 

 the body while the enveloping protoplasm accumulated outside â€” 

 and finally collapsing each of them into a small roundish pearl. 

 But after a time, each of these little pearls rapidly lengthens again 

 into a long, fine thread, that becomes mixed among the other threads 

 or "pseudopodia" which had remained expanded and rigid. 



These observations, which have been repeated several times, 

 seem to justify the following statement: The threads which compose 

 the anterior crown are not pseudopodia, but flagella, which are 

 capable of changing rapidly in their appearance and function; 

 straight and rigid as a rule, they may for a time appear as flagella, 

 with slow, flexuous undulations. However, these accessory flagella 

 widely differ in their nature from the central one, which is a true 

 fiagellum. They are also completely independent from each other, 

 one of them, for instance, is seen to vibrate while its next 

 neighbor remains stiff; or some developing into a vibrating crown 

 of flagella, while others persist in the shape of a rigid external crown 

 of pseudopodia (Plate V, fig. 2). 



As to the function of these special elements, for which we might 

 use the term "flagellopodia," in their rigid, pseudopodian state, 

 they must be considered as prehensile organs, stopping on their 

 way very small organisms or food particles and bringing them to- 

 wards the body; on two different occasions, for instance, I have seen 

 a small green particle caught by one of the rigid filaments, and the 

 thread curving over it, then slowly retracting and finally depositing 

 it on the surface of the body. This process is, however, not the 




108 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART I 



only one possible, and much more frequently the small food particle, 

 without coming into contact with the extended threads, directly 

 gets to the surface of the body, where a big vacuole is immediately 

 formed around it; but it remains certain that these rigid filaments, 

 twice or three times as long as the body, form together some- 

 thing like a net, and as such are of very evident importance. But 

 besides these functions as prehensile organs, such as are observed 

 in the pseudopodial state, could not we imagine functions of a differ- 

 ent nature, due to the flagelliform state of these particular threads? 

 When describing for the first time, in 1890, the genus Pteridomonas, 

 I felt confident I had seen the small pearls at the base of the central 

 flagellum suddenly unroll and fling the little animal backward; 

 the flagellopodia, in fact, were to be compared to the frond of a 

 fern and not to a compact shapeless body. But Scherffel, in 1901, 

 proposed another explanation; â€” he looks upon the threads as true 

 pseudopodia, quite incapable of passing into another condition; the 

 two smaller flagella, which are at times seen left and right of the 

 central flagellum, "are in no way two pseudopodia which have 

 taken to an undulating condition, as Penard thinks. Their func- 

 tion is unknown"; and a little further on he adds: "The jumps are 

 due to the energetic and sudden contractions of the fixed stalk." 

 Much later, in 1904, after observing some specimens of Pterido- 

 monas from the Lake of Geneva, I had myself abandoned my former 

 explanation to adopt the Scherffel theory, and today, after a much 

 more thorough examination, I feel confident the rolling and unroll- 

 ing explanation was a mistake; but is the sudden jerk backward 

 due really to a contraction of the pedicle? 



In Pteridomonas, the body is protracted behind into a thread of 

 extraordinary thinness, like the thread of a spider; and this 

 thread or pedicle, four, six, or as much as eight times as long as 

 the body, firmly holds the animalcule to the substratum. In 

 such an attached condition, the little organism is generally seen 

 fishing, with its central flagellum actively swinging, and the threads 

 of the anterior crown rigid, unmoved, and expanded at their full 

 length, but from time to time the animalcule suddenly disappears 

 from sight, and rapidly comes back, a jerk has thrown him to one side 

 but the fixed pedicle prevented any definitive removal. This pos- 

 terior thread is thus very important in enabling, for instance, the 

 animalcule to escape the contact of an enemy and yet remain in 

 the same region; but it is hardly to be expected that the pedicle 

 might do more than attach the body, and be comparable to the

retractile pedicle of a Vorticella. Its whole appearance is that of 

 a very thin, thread-like secretion, where no structure is to be found; 

 and indeed, facts may be cited which go against the retractile ex- 

 planation: 



Looking at a fixed Pieridomonas for a sufficient time, a moment 

 at last comes when the pedicle suddenly loses its hold, the crown 

 of pseudopodia retracts, and the little animal swims rapidly away, 

 while the detached posterior thread or pedicle trails behind. In 

 such a state of rapid locomotion, with pedicle trailing or sometimes 

 with no pedicle at all (owing to its having been ruptured or having 

 collapsed), when coming into contact with some Infusorian or any 

 other obstacle in its way, the animalcule may suddenly jerk back- 

 ward, just as it did when attached. 



Under these conditions it seems hardly possible that the stalk 

 might be the cause of the sudden jerk; and we must look for another 

 explanation. 



The most evident distinctive character between Pter. scherffeli 

 and Pter. pulex is the possession, by the first of these species, of 

 lateral filiform appendages, which are wanting in the second. Lem- 

 mermann speaks of these appendages as follows: "Besides the 

 anterior crown of pseudopodia, lateral radiating pseudopodia are 

 found." Neither Scherffel nor Lemmermann speak of these "pseu- 

 dopodia" as being regularly distributed, and the first of these ob- 

 servers speaks of both anterior crown and lateral appendages in 

 the following terms: "The fine setose cilia, which radiate mostly 

 from the anterior part of the body, around the flagellum, but some- 

 times also start, in a smaller number, from the sides of the body, are 

 true pseudopodia." Both these authors, in fact, seem to consider 

 these lateral appendages as identical with those of the anterior 

 crown, and at the same time as irregularly located on the sides 

 of the body. But the reality is, that these particular threads, six 

 in number (or perhaps eight ?), are inserted in a single equatorial 

 line, or girdle, which itself is, in most of the individuals, indicated 

 by a slight groove that divides the body into two parts, superior 

 and inferior. These threads are extraordinarily thin, are straight 

 and rigid, and are twice or even three times as long as the body; 

 they never are converted into flagella, and never retract into sep- 

 arate pearls, and are in no way comparable to the constituent 

 parts of the anterior crown â€” they rather seem to be identical with 

 those setae with which some Infusoria (e. g., Mesodinium pulex) 

 are provided. Now in these Infusoria the setae always work as a 




110 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART I 



jumping organ; and why should their function not be the same in 

 Pteridomonas? There is a fact, indeed, which seems to contradict 

 such a theory, â€” Pteridomonas pulex, which has no such setae, jumps 

 just as well as PL scherffeli which possesses setae, but . . . it is 

 not quite certain that Pier, pulex is unprovided with setae. None 

 have been seen, it is true, but they are so extremely indistinct, in 

 Pter. scherffeli, that during the first days of my observations I had 

 no idea it was not Pter. pulex I had to do with, and only later on 

 the mistake was found. 1 



It is, then, to that aequatorial girdle of setae that I should be 

 disposed today to attribute the jerks of Pteridomonas, but the ques- 

 tion yet remains in doubt. 



When speaking of the anterior crown, we saw that each of its 

 " flagellopodia" is liable to collapse into a small globular body, 

 and that all of these small pearls constitute then a sessile ring around 

 the central flagellum. Now it is rather interesting to notice that 

 this very sort of ring sometimes is found also at the posterior ex- 

 tremity (Plate V, fig. 1). In that particular locality, the Ariana 

 Park, which furnished practically all my material, this posterior 

 crown existed in one out of five individuals, being sometimes well 

 developed, more often more or less reduced in the number of the 

 "pearls", but none of these pearls ever could be seen to develop 

 into a thread; they were always in the retracted state, and very 

 likely were unable to change in any way. 



As to the meaning of that posterior crown of pearls, at first sight 

 it seems that it would indicate the anterior part of a new individual, 

 to be formed by an act of division which must then prove trans- 

 verse. In spite of the fact that a transverse division would be 

 very exceptional in a Flagellate, I was inclined to consider it as 

 very probable here, till meeting one particular specimen which 

 certainly was dividing (Plate V, fig. 3). It was much broader than 

 long, with two flagella, a nucleus elongated transversally to the ver- 

 tical axis of the body, and two posterior threads, each with some 

 pearls around its base. This specimen showed the beginning of a 

 longitudinal division. We must then conclude that the meaning 

 of the posterior crown is not yet understood. 



1 The first description of Pter. pulex is dated 1890. At that time I had at my 

 disposal only a small, student's microscope, and practically the aequatorial setae 

 must have been invisible. Besides, Pter. pulex hardly ever seems to have been 

 studied afterwards. Scherffel and Lemmermann had Pter. scherffeli under ob- 

 servation, and though some other observers cite Pter. pulex, I do not know of 

 any who studied it.

Such are the observations which I could make on Pteridomonas, 

 a very small and delicate organism, but one whose structure proves 

 very particularly interesting; and in my opinion the principal in- 

 terest attaches to the special threads or "flagellopodia," whose 

 functions are double, now pseudopodia, now flagella. Scherffelie, 

 1911, whilst treating of Chrysopyxis bipes and its pseudopodia, ob- 

 serves that the existence of food-capturing flagella has never been 

 proved in any of the Protozoa; but in Pteridomonas we find some- 

 thing quite exceptional: the food is caught by pseudopodia, the 

 undulating movements are due to flagella, but these very flagella 

 were pseudopodia some minutes before, and next moment will be 

 so again. 



Dimorpha tetramastix sp. n. Plate V, figs. 4-6. 



"Cells with distinct periplast, free-swimming. Pseudopodia nu- 

 merous, with axial threads that radiate from a central granule 

 situated inside the body. Two flagella, originating in the neighbor- 

 hood of the central granule. Nuculus with distinct caryosome. 

 One to several contractile vesicles. . . ." 



Such is the diagnosis given by Lemmermann (in Pascher's ' 'Siiss- 

 wasser-Flora," p. 51) of the genus Dimorpha, which Gruber (14) 

 created in 1881 for a small Protozoan whose characters are at the 

 same time those of a Heliozoon and a Flagellate. 



Dimorpha mutans is the only species that has been described; 

 however, one other has been at least indicated. Blochmann (3), in 

 1894, after treating of Dimorpha mutans, concludes in the following 

 terms: "I myself found, in the summer of 1885 in a pond of the 

 Schwetzinger Garden, another form, of which I unhappily took 

 only a few incomplete sketches. It differed from D. mutans in 

 the possession of four flagella, and also in the fact that it always 

 swam about with fully expanded pseudopodia." 



In the month of July last, and later in August and September, I 

 found in the same pond of the Ariana Park a species of Dimorpha 

 provided with four flagella. Is it the same as that mentioned by 

 Blochmann? Possibly so, but, as we shall see later, it is not cer- 

 tain. Is it even a Dimorpha? According to the first diagnosis of 

 the genus, which mentions two flagella, it is not; but, like Bloch- 

 mann, I should rather insist on the fact of the resemblance with 

 an Heliozoon than on the possession of one, two or more flagella. 



Dimorpha is indeed now a Heliozoon, and now a Flagellate. Let 

 us first consider our Dim. tetramastix in the Heliozoon, that is, in 

 the resting state (Plate V, fig. 4) : 




112 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART I 



The spherical body, 30 to 33pi in diameter (much larger than 

 Dim. mutans) is naked, but not smooth, owing to the presence of 

 numerous granules of a relatively large size, some of which project 

 a little outside the surface. Two layers, in fact, may be distin- 

 guished in the plasma, the ectoplasm with the above-mentioned 

 granular bodies, and the clearer endoplasm; but the difference be- 

 tween the two layers is here much less distinct than in typical Heli- 

 ozoa, those for instance which constitute the group of the Chalaro- 

 thoraca. Around the body, and radiating in every direction, but 

 less numerous anteriorly, are the pseudopodia, straight and very 

 fine, whose length attains to 1 3^ to 2 times the diameter of the body. 

 Just as in Heliozoa, they are covered with small granulations, but 

 are even smaller here; and besides, they have sometimes a peculiar 

 appearance, which does not seem to have been observed in Heliozoa 

 as a rule : as long as they have not attained to their entire develop- 

 ment, their tip is blunt, truncated at a right angle to the longitudinal 

 axis; but when fully extended, they are pointed; one might suppose 

 that in the first case the layer of viscous plasma which covers the 

 axial thread did not extend further than the axial thread itself, 

 and in the second case it had gone farther, lengthening to a point. 

 Axial filaments exist here indeed, as in typical Heliozoa, and in 

 favorable conditions they may be seen to penetrate the plasma and 

 converge towards a central granule, which itself is easily distin- 

 guishable, and with carmine stains quickly. But this "central 

 granule" is in fact never quite central but lies at a greater or less 

 distance from the center toward the anterior extremity. 



This central granule is itself surrounded by the special apparatus 

 which Gruber (14), Blochmann (3), Schouteden (31) have already 

 described in Dimorpha mutans, but which is here of a rather differ- 

 ent nature, consisting of very small, yellow, spherical grains, which 

 are set around the central granule like numerous radiating chap- 

 lets, owing, very likely, to their being attached to the axial fila- 

 ments which converge towards the centre. All together, they build 

 up a kind of spherical cage, quite characteristic of Dimorpha 

 tetramastix and allowing one easily to distinguish this species from 

 any Heliozoon in the vicinity. 



Food is caught by the pseudopodia, and in a very characteristic 

 manner. On four or five different occasions I observed the cap- 

 ture, and always it was the same small Infusorian, Balanitozoon 

 agile, which suddenly came into contact with one or several of the 

 pseudopodia; these then tightened around their captive, and at 

 the same time a very thin film or velum came creeping over the 

 pseudopodia, lengthened into a cup, and finally closed behind the 

 Infusorian. This latter, which had been suddenly killed as by some 

 special poison, became more and more elongated, then was cut into 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 113 



two parts, the first of which entered the body of the Dimorpha; 

 the second fragment then divided again, and finally each of the 

 separated portions got into the Dimorpha and quickly rounded 

 itself into a small pellet. Our Dimorpha seemed in fact to feed 

 exclusively on this little Infusorian, and proved excessively glutton- 

 ous. Three minutes are sufficient for the conversion of a living 

 Balanitozoon into a number of pellets inside the Dimorpha, and this 

 latter, which measured at first say about 30fji in diameter, increases 

 to 40[jl in diameter after the capture. 



We must now consider the flagella somewhat at length. In a 

 Dimorpha favorably oriented for good observation, one can dis- 

 tinguish in the body an anterior part, slightly flattened, and even 

 sometimes depressed to form a shallow median cup, and from that 

 cup arise four very fine threads, hardly visible, about twice the 

 length of the body; they appear and suddenly disappear, and when 

 lost are very difficult to trace again, owing to their extraordinary 

 tenuity. Two of them are often seen to cross each other at a short 

 distance from their base, which fact is due to their being in pairs, 

 one of the pairs originating left and the other right of a central 

 point of fixation (Plate V, fig. 4) . 



Gruber could not ascertain the presence of a nucleus, at least 

 in the living animalcule, but says he easily demonstrated it with 

 reagents. Blochmann, however, and afterwards Schouteden (31), 

 each gave a rather complete description of what they considers a 

 the nuclear apparatus, and it is interesting to quote what the latter, 

 of these observers writes upon the subject: "The nucleus is already 

 visible in the living animal, more or less distinctly according to 

 the individuals. But it is easy to make it appear by killing the 

 organism with a solution of picric acid, which colors the nucleus 

 yellow. One sees then that chormatin is united in a thick mass 

 which in optical section appears like a crescent with more or less 

 rounded or obtuse points; really this mass constitutes something 

 like a hemisphere (or segmant of a sphere, smaller or sometimes 

 larger,) hollow but with a thick wall. 



"Inside that peculiar mass, in the cavity which it surrounds, 

 one sees the axial threads of the pseudopodia, which pass through 

 the body, to converge toward the same point, namely to a shining, 

 very distinct granule, which is indeed already visible, with some 

 attention, in the living animal. In this same place, besides, is the 

 insertion of the flagella, which diverge from the common point 

 inside the plasma and come out of the body in two distinctly sepa- 

 rated regions .... Blochmann was rather puzzled by the fact that the 

 axial threads of the pseudopodia thus converge through the nucleus 




114 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART I 



toward a common point. He does not think probable that there 

 could be there a continuous axis which would pierce through the 

 nuclear substance. And yet, according to my observations, the 

 complicated apparatus of Dimorpha must indeed be thus explained. 

 The axial threads which are seen converging run completely through 

 the chromatic mass, pierce it in fact, and nevertheless they are 

 absolutely continuous and homogeneous." 



These observations are interesting, in so far as they show the 

 flagella to be inserted quite near the central granule; but both 

 Blochmann and Schouteden are certainly wrong when they consider 

 as a nucleus that particular apparatus which we have seen in Di- 

 morpha tetramastix consists in radiating lines of pearls. In reality, 

 the true nucleus, generally concealed by the accumulation of gran- 

 ules and food -particles, easily comes to view by means of a slight 

 compression of the animal. It quite conforms in character to an 

 ordinary Heliozoan nucleus, being rather large, homogeneous, vari- 

 able in its shape, and always somewhat excentric in position. 2 There 

 are several contractile vesicles, variable in number, but so obscured 

 by the mass of granules and food-particles that fill the external 

 layers of the body, that one hardly sees them. 



Such is the Heliozoan form of Dimorpha tetramastix; but if we 

 keep the animalcule under observation for a while, after five, ten, 

 twenty minutes or more, we can see its transformation into the 

 flagellate state. Suddenly, and without any apparent motive, the 

 pseudopodia are seen to retract, at the same time as the body length- 

 ens, and the central granule with the surrounding chaplets of pearls 

 moves forward; and after a single second of time, or at most two, 

 the Heliozoan has disappeared, and instead we have a true Fla- 

 gellate (Plate V, fig. 5), more or less lengthene, with an anterior 

 depression from which arise the two pairs of flagella. Something, 

 however, is frequently left of the pseudopodia, in the form of lateral 

 or, more often, posterior appendages, more or less covered with 

 granules (Plate V, fig. 6); and some of the axial threads are still 

 visible, trailing inside the body, behind the central granule 

 which is now quite near the anterior extremity. 



It is possible only under particularly favorable conditions to 

 get a clear view of the phenomenon of the mechanism of that sud- 

 den transformation, but I was able to observe it several times and 



2 Blochmann, in his figure of D. mutans in the Heliozoan state, has in fact 

 represented the nucleus, but as a "particle of food." 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 115 



with sufficient clearness to be able to explain the facts. The pseu- 

 dopodia, at the same time that they retract and shorten, move 

 backward while the central granule is brought forward; this dis- 

 placement of the pseudopodia is, in fact, to be compared to the 

 shutting of an umbrella, whose ribs are brought down and collapse 

 together. As for the cause of the shutting, it must very likely 

 be sought in internal movements inside the plasma, which result 

 in an accumulation of clear pure ectoplasm at the anterior extremity, 

 if we can imagine a current coming from behind and pushing the 

 central granule forward along the longitudinal axis of the body, 

 and at the same time lateral backward currents pushing the axial 

 rods downward, we can get an idea of the transformation. 



As it is, the Flagellate, which now measures about 37[x in length, 

 i. e., 7[i more than in the Heliozoan shape, immediately takes to 

 swimming, rapidly drawn forward by its flagella. As already noted, 

 some of the pseudopodia, or rather some of the axial threads with 

 their covering of granulations, are very often seen trailing laterally 

 or behind, but I never could see, as Blochmann said of his unidenti- 

 fied Dimorpha, the animalcule swimming with completely and nor- 

 mally expanded pseudopodia. 



Swimming never lasts very long; the most trifling cause is suffi- 

 cient to instigate reversion to the Heliozoan type; the animalcule 

 is seen to stop, and suddenly the pseudopodia make their appear- 

 ance, lengthening at the same time as they are brought forward, 

 while the central granule moves downward toward the center of 

 the body The same kind of phenomenon has taken place, which 

 we compared to the shutting of an umbrella, but it is now the open- 

 ing, and it has been even more rapid. 3 This transformation from 

 the Flagellate state to the Heliozoan type is brought about by any- 

 thing that might be supposed to indicate trouble or danger â€” a 

 small Infusorian in the vicinity, a current of water, etc. â€” while 

 the inverse, the transformation from the Heliozoan into a Flagel- 

 late, is much more difficult to produce; a strong light, however, 

 which provokes the displacement of the animalcule toward a cooler 

 region, is often successful. Very probably, the Heliozoan form is 

 the form of defense, the pseudopodia firmly affixing the body to 

 resist currents, and at the same time it is the fishing-form, allowing 

 small organisms to be caught by the pseudopodia. 



3 This reversion is still more shortened by the action of a chemical reagent; 

 in one particular case, for instance, I have seen the transformation entirely 

 effected in the half of a second, under the influence of a very weak current of 

 glycerin and carmine. 




116 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART I 



Must we consider Dimorpha as a Heliozoon or as a Flagellate? 

 As a Flagellate, of course, since it is an understood fact that all 

 organisms are to be considered as such, which possess flagella in 

 the adult state; but the affinities with Heliozoa are so great that, 

 in fact, we might look upon this organism as a Heliozoon also. In 

 some of the representatives of this latter group, for instance, Clath- 

 rulina, an embryonic stage is known, where the little being is in 

 possession of flagella ; and one might be entitled to ask if Dimorpha 

 could not be a member of the same group, in which the flagella 

 persist up to the adult state? 



In this connection I should like to relate a rather curious coin- 

 cidence: in the same locality there was living, in still much greater 

 abundance, a genuine Heliozoon, of a yet undetermined type, and 

 whose likeness to Dimorpha tetramastix was such that only the 

 possession of the characteristic pearl apparatus and the non- 

 existence of a flagellated state allowed an easy distinction. At the 

 same time, there were occasions when I never could detect any 

 trace of flagella in otherwise typical Dimorphas, and sometimes 

 also the pearl apparatus was hardly to be seen. Dimorpha might 

 be supposed to lose finally its flagella, as well as the pearl apparatus 

 which in some unknown way might be in relation with them? But, 

 leaving that supposition aside, what more beautiful example of 

 mimicry could we imagine? 



Dimorpha monomastix sp. n. Plate V, flgs. 7. 8. 



The preceding species was characterized by the presence of four 

 flagella; now we find only one. Dimorpha monomastix was found 

 in the same locality, and in a much greater abundance, but its small 

 size makes it rather more difficult to study. 



The little organism is about lOtx in diameter, transparent and 

 colorless; in a superficial region are seen dispersed all sorts of gran- 

 ules and food-particles, surrounding an indistinctly delimited clearer 

 central region or endoplasm, which contains the nucleus. This 

 latter is spherical, with a distinct nuclear membrane and a large 

 central caryosome. Very likely this endoplasmic region also con- 

 tains a central granule, which, however, I did not see. There are 

 several contractile vesicles, all very small, except one that might 

 be considered as the principal one, the others being accessory. All 

 around the body are the pseudopodia, of the typical Heliozoan 

 type, but relatively short, measuring about 1 % times the diameter 

 of the body. The flagellum, always single, is of a moderate length 

 also, about the same as that of the pseudopodia, but strong and 

 thick, much thicker, in fact, than in Dimorpha tetramastix. How- 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 117 



ever, it is extremely transparent, and there is some difficulty in 

 distinguishing it; a moderate enlargement, indeed, which allows of 

 a very small diaphragm, is better for its detection than very strong 

 magnificat ion. 



During the Heliozoan state of rest, the flagellum remains quiet, 

 and nearly always with a peculiar shape, somewhat like a figure 8 

 (Plate V, fig. 7); from time to time, however, it is seen slowly to 

 unroll, and to perform one or two slight movements, soon coming 

 at rest again. 



This Heliozoan type is the less frequent form, and the animal- 

 cule never keeps it for a very long time. After a few minutes of 

 observation, the swinging of the flagellum grows quicker and more 

 frequent, and suddenly the whole body seems to be subjected to a 

 disturbance, a rupture of its internal equilibrium. It collapses, in 

 fact, and one might take it to be disorganized and dead; but after 

 hardly one or two seconds have passed, the whole mass, as by en- 

 chantment, lengthens into a fusiform body, having anteriorly a 

 quickly-moving flagellum. 



The little flagellated being (Plate V, fig. 8), which from 10[jl in 

 the Heliozoan state has now increased to 18[x in length, and even 

 sometimes more, has the appearance of a fish, broader at the an- 

 terior part, and drawn posteriorly into an often very thin and long 

 extremity, which seems to result from the fact that the axial threads 

 have joined together and trail behind. The nucleus, very distinct, 

 has come forward, very near the anterior extremity, and is seen 

 surrounded by very small, hyaline granulations. The flagellum 

 comes straight from a slight excavation in the middle of the anterior, 

 rounded extremity. Several small contractile vesicles are visible, 

 one of them larger, near the posterior end of the body. 



The animalcule goes straight forward in a rapid course and swims 

 for a very long time, for hours probably; then suddenly it stops, 

 the flagellum becomes quiet and takes the characteristic figure 8 

 shape; again a commotion, which shakes the whole body, and rays 

 are seen to protrude from every part of the surface. In two sec- 

 onds, the Flagellate has turned into a Heliozoon. 



The transformation is effected here in the same way as we saw 

 it in Dimorpha tetramastix, but is much less evident to the eye. 



Bicoeca exilis sp. n. Plate V, flgs, 9-13. 



This elegant little Flagellate was found, in February, 1918, rather 

 abundant in one of the aquaria of the Zoological Laboratory of 




118 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART I 



the University. Most generally it was attached to the threads of 

 a small Nostoc, either solitary or with one or two companions, but 

 never in big colonies. 



The little capsule (Plate V, fig. 9), very thin and colorless, is 8[x 

 in length; ovoid or somewhat fusiform in shape, pointed behind and 

 opened anteriorly in a large aperture, at right angle to the longi- 

 tudinal axis. This opening, however, is rather variable in breadth, 

 according not only to the individuals, but also to the orientation 

 of the animal; the capsule, in fact, is a little compressed, more so 

 at the opening than anywhere else, and at the same time proves 

 somewhat elastic; when the animalcule protrudes for half its length 

 out of the shell, it presses against the sides and makes the opening 

 rounder, and when suddenly retracting the edges of the aperture 

 contract. The capsule is affixed to the substratum by means of 

 a very thin pedicle, a simple colorless filament, whose length is 

 exceedingly variable, and is commonly twice or three times as great 

 as that of the capsule, sometimes even more. Frequently it is 

 seen to terminate at the point of fixation in a small bluish knob 

 or cushion, and from the fact that the volume of the knob is in 

 inverse proportion to the length of the pedicle, one can infer that 

 it furnishes the material for the lengthening of this thread. This 

 growth of the pedicle, however, must be very quick, and reaches its limit 

 a very few moments after the fixation of the animalcule; such is, at 

 any rate, the inference that might be drawn from the fact that speci- 

 mens with very short stalks (Plate V, figs. 9, 12), kept under ob- 

 servation for ten, twelve and twenty-four hours, never showed 

 during that time any lengthening of their stems. Very likely the 

 length of the pedicle is in some relation with the conditions of the 

 medium; for instance, in some material which had been kept a long 

 time since it was collected, I once found all the individuals short- 

 stalked (Plate V, fig. 12). The animalcule hardly fills half of the 

 capsule. In its perfectly expanded state, it is pear-shaped. At the 

 anterior extremity and on one side is seen projecting a protoplasmic 

 appendage which looks at first sight like a very short pseudopodium ; 

 but in reality the ectoplasmic layer developed here in a collar-like 

 expansion, hardly conspicuous on one side but very extended on 

 the other, and whose function is to hold fast the small particles of 

 food that the flagellum has thrown down. The flagellum, which 

 starts from the anterior depression, is strong and very distinct, 

 and of very remarkable length, attaining five or even six times the 

 length of the body. When the animalcule is quietly fishing, with 

 its body half protruded from the shell (Plate V, fig. 9) , the flagellum 

 is seen pointing directly upwards, and hardly seems to move, but 

 sometimes is only distinguishable up to the half of its length, the 

 tip only vibrating. The animalcule does not, as a rule, remain 

 very long in the extended state ; it suddenly retracts inside the shell 

 and becomes ovoid in shape, but for a very short time only, soon ex- 

 panding again. The behavior of the flagellum is then very inter- 

 esting to follow: when the animalcule retracts, the flagellum coils 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA 119 



in a perfectly regular manner, so as to simulate a coil of rope with 

 four or five turns, which stands upright over the retracted body (Plate 

 V, fig. 1 1) ; then as soon as the animalcule begins expanding (Plate V, 

 fig. 12), the coils rapidly unroll and are flung far out like a lasso 

 thrown by an invisible arm. The retraction of the body down to 

 the bottom of the cell is effected by means of a thread, which is 

 seen affixed to the very tip of the inside wall, and looks â€” but only 

 looks â€” like a continuation of the pedicle inside the envelope; from 

 this basal point the thread passes up along the body and comes to 

 an upper fixation quite near the base of the anterior flagellum ; in 

 fact, this posterior thread is nothing but a flagellum, which has 

 temporarily lost its normal functions to acquire those of a retractile 

 organ. The nucleus is spherical, and situated posteriorly, near 

 one side of the body; it is rather pale, not very distinct, and shows 

 a large central caryosome. The contractile vesicle is at the pos- 

 terior extremity, behind the nucleus; sometimes a second one is 

 to be seen, but though being able to empty and fill again from time 

 to time like an ordinary contractile vesicle, it can hardly be con- 

 sidered as such, but is rather an accessory vacuole, whose function 

 is to refill the true vesicle when empty. 



I was not able to study the division inside the envelope, but on 

 the 16th and 17th of February, I found, among a great number of 

 empty cases, a good many small Flagellata which were rapidly 

 swimming about, and whose appearance was that of individuals 

 belonging to this species after leaving their shell; all characteristics 

 were the same, except for the form of the body, that of a true, naked 

 Flagellate, with two flagella, one of which was trailing behind (Plate 

 V, fig. 13) ; it was certainly the retractile thread, which in this new 

 flagellated state had recovered its true nature. It would have 

 been interesting to notice the fixation of these small Flagellates 

 and the construction of the shell, but my attempts in that direc- 

 tion were not successful. 



The rather numerous species which make up the genus Bicoeca 

 are all of very small size, and the distinctive characters are some- 

 times very hard to recognize; the form of the capsule, however, is 

 very constant, and the length of the flagellum, and the position 

 and number of the contractile vesicles, also furnish important facts. 

 The taxonomy of the genus is however, anything but clear. Bicoeca 

 and the construction of the shell, but my attempts in that direc- 

 lacustris J. Clark, for instance, as indicated by Lemmermann (27), 

 is considerably different from the same species as figured and 

 described by S. Kent (this latter observer speaks also of a second 

 very small anterior flagellum, which character would refer to

our Bicoeca exilis; but the special shape of the capsule, as also the 

 very exceptional length of the flagellum, seem to point to a special 

 organism, which has not yet been described. 



Histiona campanula sp. u. Plate VI, flgs. 14-19. 



During the autumn of 1917,, I found in a pond at Pinchat, a small 

 Flagellate which seems to belong to Histiona, a genus itself very 

 little known. It was most generally found fixed on the threads of 

 a certain Zygnema, very often forming long colonies of indi- 

 viduals, standing next to each other along the mucilaginous sheath 

 of the alga. 



The protoplasmic body, very clear and delicate, occupies less 

 than half of the capsule (Plate VI, fig. 14), which latter is itself 

 so thin and transparent that its structure is not determined without 

 some difficulty. It may be compared to an inverted bell, broadly 

 open upwards, and whose closed end would be stretched on one 

 side, so as to make a horn-like prolongation; and owing to this 

 special form the little case, which rests with its posterior point just 

 on the surface of the mucilaginous sheath, appears bent down like a 

 small flower (Campanula) on its stalk, the concave side of the cap- 

 sule being towards the Zygnema (Plate VI, fig. 14). The little 

 capsule is at the same time laterally compressed, and seen from 

 behind looks somewhat like a sugar-loaf (Plate VI, fig. 15). The 

 capsule is provided with a pedicle, thin and colorless, which goes 

 right through the jelly and joins the surface of the cellulose mem- 

 brane of the Zygnema, where it is most generally seen to attach by 

 means of a shining little cushion. The pedicle, we must observe, 

 is not a true pedicle in fact, but is rather a protoplasmic thread 

 more solidly affixing 'the cell to the substratum; the jelly alone 

 would not allow of a sufficient hold; and, by the way, we must add 

 that the mucilaginous layer being generally perfectly invisible, the 

 capsule seems to be provided with a stalk, as for the length of this 

 stalk, it is of course equal to the thickness of the mucilaginous layer, 

 about 13[x or sometimes a little more or less. The protoplasmic 

 body, which appears as if suspended inside the capsule without 

 anything to keep it in place, is also very individual in its appear- 

 ance: rounded behind, cup-shaped anteriorly, it is drawn up on 

 one of its borders (always the same, that which is in contact with 

 the convex face of the shell) into a long trunk-like appendage, which 

 passes beyond the capsule and protrudes into the surrounding 

 liquid. From the tip of that peculiar appendage stretch right and 

 left two thin and broad protoplasmic curtains, which, passing over 

 the intervening space join at last the opposite border of the cell. 

 In fact, these curtains, or veils, may be considered as representing 

 the extreme borders of the cup-shaped body, which have grown 

 very thin and transparent. One of these veils, moreover, is much 

 more developed than the other, and about the middle of its course 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 121 



is drawn up in an angular lobe, to be affixed there to the inside of 

 the wall of the capsule, and this in a very curious way, by means of 

 a "nail," a very small bluish spot, which is never wanting. Very 

 likely this very fixation of one of these curtains to the border of 

 the cell is a result of the necessity for the cup (or anterior part of 

 the body) to remain open, for the veil, if it passed straight over to 

 join the border at the opposite side, would prevent small food- 

 particles falling into the cup. 4 The flagella are perhaps more curi- 

 ous than any other element in this already somewhat para- 

 doxal being. There are two : the first one, which we might call the 

 principal flagellum, starts (or rather seems to start?) from 

 one of the borders of the cup, which we may consider as the right 

 one, and very soon bends to the left, describing thus the figure of 

 an arc, and finally terminates freely somewhat to the left of that 

 appendage which we called the trunk. This flagellum nearly al- 

 ways proves perfectly quiet, like a bow stretched over the cell 

 as if for aprotection against the intrusion of any enemy. It is a 

 genuine flagellum, however, and from time to time begins vibrating, 

 but becomes quiet again after a moment. The second flagellum 

 is perhaps even more curious: upon looking attentively at the left 

 border of the cup, and more especially at the tip of the " trunk," we find 

 there (Plate VI, fig. 16) two very small bluish granules, one behind 

 the other, and from the upper granule is seen to start a rigid, straight 

 thread, whose length nearly equals that of the body, the structure 

 of the thread, which diminishes in breadth from the base to the 

 summit, seems to be that of an axial filament covered with a thin 

 layer of hyaline plasma. This thread immediately turns some- 

 what to the left, and there remains quiet, like a tactile organ or 

 seta, from time to time, however, it is seen to move right or left, 

 like the hand of a watch, or, very rarely, to swing in a few longi- 

 tudinal undulations, but only to come quickly to rest again. Indeed 

 it hardly looks, like a flagellum, but is such in fact, only it 

 temporarily departs from its normal functions to acquire a new 

 importance. If we look very attentively at the anterior small 

 corpuscle of which we were just speaking, and not above but be- 

 hind it, we can just distinguish a very fine median line or thread, 

 which passes the posterior granule, then continues its way down 

 towards the bottom of the cup-shaped body. 



In short, Histiona campanula is in possession of two flagella, 

 but both seem to have been considerably modified in either struc- 

 ture or function. 5 



4 1 never could see the second of these two "curtains" affixed to the 

 capsule, and this second curtain is in fact so much smaller than the first that it 

 might be considered simply the normal border of the cup. 



6 These statements about the flagella are the result of a good many observa- 

 tions, but the animalcule is exceedingly small and delicate, and more than one 

 doubt is left in my mind about some points of its structure. I have seen, for 

 instance, on two different occasions a very short flagellum beating at the floor 

 of the cup; was it a normal structure, or perhaps the basal part of the right 

 flagellum, torn off from the affixing blue grannule ? 




122 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART I 



It is not likely that these modified elements should be considered 

 as the principal agents in the capture of food. Rather must we 

 think that the large surface displayed by the cup with its velum- 

 like borders has the function of a net; I have very often observed 

 small nutritive particles to be thrown, or rather to get caught on 

 the surface of the expanded cup; and suddenly, when it hardly 

 touches the net, a vacuole is formed, inside which the microbe 

 (most frequently microbes were the normal food) violently struggles 

 for a time, then suddenly collapses, as if killed by some poisonous 

 substance. The food-vacuole then glides along the velum and 

 finally disappears inside the body. 



The nucleus, spherical and with a big central caryosome, is very 

 distinctly seen, in the hind-part of the body. There is only one 

 contractile vesicle, not far from the nucleus; some other vacuoles, 

 however, are at times visible, either containing food-particles or 

 not. 



Phenomena were not observed concerning the division of the 

 body, but I have frequently met with individuals in the naked 

 state, which either resulted from an act of division, or, in a ma- 

 jority of the cases at least, had left their envelope to take to a swim- 

 ming existence. Their appearance is quite characteristic (Plate VI, 

 figs. 17, 18), nearly that of a mandolin, whose handle would be 

 represented by that peculiar "trunk" we have spoken of; but then, 

 from this very extremity where the small blue granule is still to 

 be seen, starts now, not a rigid thread, but a true flagellum, which, 

 beating normally, draws the animalcule forward in a rapid course; 

 the functions, indeed, of the thread have changed, and have be- 

 come those of a normal flagellum. 



As for the other flagellum, which we looked on formerly as the 

 principal one, it is now seen to start from the posterior, slightly 

 pointed extremity of the body, and immediately curves upward, 

 describing an arc whose tip becomes lost behind the body, near the 

 base of the trunk; this bow-like curvature seems at first sight to 

 delineate the very contour of the body (Plate VI, fig. 17), which 

 fact gives the little being a very peculiar appearance. 



After swimming for a time, the little Flagellate comes to rest; 

 it sets itself down on the surface of a Zygnema-th.rea,d, and firmly im- 

 plants itself there by its posterior pointed extremity; and hardly 

 is the contact effected when a small root begins piercing the jelly 

 (Plate VI, fig. 19), growing longer and longer, till after a few min- 

 utes it reaches the solid wall. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 123 



I could not ascertain how the animalcule constructs the new 

 envelope. It seems likely that the naked individual, when already- 

 fixed, can remain a very long time unprovided with any covering; 

 I found once a colony where all the animalcules, about six in number, 

 were naked, and three days afterwards, though living and ap- 

 parently in good health, only one of them was provided with a 

 capsule. It is interesting to note that the animalcule, as seen en- 

 closed in the shell, does not occupy the same position as he did 

 when free; the posterior point, from which arises the arcuated fla- 

 gellum, must have become displaced upwards and to the right, 

 at the same time that the body became free from the pedicle and 

 climbed up towards the opening of the shell. 



Salpingoeca poly gona turn sp. n. Plate VI, flgs. 20-28. 



This small organism was found in the same locality as the last 

 one, at Pinchat, on the long filaments of Zygnema pectinatum, and 

 as a rule the threads were either abundantly provided with the 

 little Flagellate, or had none at all. 



The capsule (Plate VI, fig. 20-28) is about 17[x in length with a 

 breadth of 43^ to 5^ only; it is nearly cylindrical for most of its length, 

 but is somewhat broadened at the aperture, and is rather abruptly 

 narrower behind, 6 terminating in a point which itself rests on a 

 thin, very short stalk; but note that, as in Histiona campanula, 

 the stalk is not a true pedicle, rather a root, which pierces the muci- 

 laginous sheath of the Zygnema and becomes attached to the cellu- 

 lose wall below. It may be observed at the same time that His- 

 tiona and Salpingoeca chose two different Zygnamas as a sub- 

 stratum, and that in the former of those animalcules the jelly coat- 

 ing was thicker than in the second; hence the longer stalk in His- 

 tiona. The protoplasmic body (Plate VI, fig. 20), cylindrical in 

 shape, and about IO^jl in length, looks as if hanging down inside 

 the cell, its upper end reaching as far as the aperture, while the 

 lower, rounded end is at some distance from the bottom. It re- 

 mains entirely quiescent, as a rule, but from time to time the little 

 organism shakes weakly from head to foot, or suddenly retracts 

 to the very bottom of the shell. The nucleus, spherical with a big 

 central caryosome, is in the anterior part of the body, normally 

 between two layers of very small hyaline granules. The contractile 

 vesicle, rather large, has its place in the posterior portion of the 

 body. When the animalcule is seen somewhat retracted in the 

 shell, but still with its cylindrical shape, it proves to be deprived 

 temporarily of that special protoplasmic collar which is known 



6 The form is nearly that of the flower in the genus Polygonatum, hence the 

 specific name. 




124 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART I 



in Craspedomonads, but instead, there is a thick layer of delicate 

 purely ectoplasmic substance, which constitutes, in fact, the ma- 

 terial for the building up of the collar. After a moment's observa- 

 tion, one notices the protoplasmic layer growing upwards, becoming 

 cup-shaped and more and more lengthened, and at last it has grown 

 into a funnel, whose length nearly equals that of the animalcule 

 itself, but it is so thin and delicate that only the two borders, right 

 and left, can be seen, and as for the anterior rim it remains (as in 

 most of the Craspedomonadina) entirely invisible. 



In Salpingoeca polygonatum, as well as in several other rep- 

 resentatives of the group, one might easily believe in the presence 

 of two concentric protoplasmic collars; but it would be a mistake, 

 and I can only agree with the conclusions of Lemmermann (24: 

 p. 564) relative to Diplosigopsis frequentissima: "As there is, in 

 fact, in that species but one plasmatic collar, it must pass to the 

 genus Salpingoeca." But when the same observer continues 1 "How 

 it is with the other Craspedomonads where two plasmatic collars 

 have been mentioned, remains to be investigated," I should go 

 further yet and should not be astonished if both the genera Diplosiga 

 and Diplosigopsis had to be abandoned. 



The flagellum, about XYi times as long as the animalecule, is rather 

 thick and distinct, and points straight upward, swinging with longi- 

 tudinal undulations that sometimes affect the whole length of the 

 flagellum, and at other times only concern the tip. 



I very often had the opportunity to observe the reproductive 

 phenomena, which are very interesting here. In Craspedomonads, 

 transverse division, quite an exceptional fact among Flagellata, has 

 been several times mentioned, and S. Kent, for instance, figures it 

 in Salpingoeca gracilis, on Plate VI of his great classical work. 

 Within the capsule are seen the two products of the division, still 

 united to each other by a very thin tubular film, which soon will 

 cut in the middle and form the two new collars. My own observa- 

 tions quite confirm the facts; first the body retracts, then loses its 

 shape and appears an ovoid mass, and finally this mass becomes 

 transversally sectioned ; the upper of the two animalcules thus formed 

 then rapidly rises towards the aperture of the shell, drawing out 

 at the same time an axial, varicose filament or future flagellum, 

 which gets thinner and thinner, and forming also around the cir- 

 cumference a thin tubular protoplasmic film, which unites the two 

 new individuals (Plate VI, fig. 21). Each of these then lengthens, 

 and the upper one becomes somewhat curved, leans with its con- 

 cave side against the border of the capsule, and disengages its fla- 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 125 



gellum (either by a simple cutting, or perhaps, as it sometimes 

 seemed to be, by separation of two flagella, which existed before 

 but were glued together); at the same moment, the plasmatic tube 

 divides and soon retracts on each of the new individuals. As soon 

 as the separation is achieved, the upper individual oscillates on the 

 rim of the shell, turns slowly down, and' its flagellum is then seen 

 pointing forwards. The little organism contracts somewhat, and 

 remains quiet for some time, then suddenly darts forward, carrying 

 in front of it a very long flagellum, longer, it seems, that it will be 

 afterwards (Plate VI, fig. 22). It swims very rapidly, describing 

 large circles, then suddenly stops, rests for a time, starts and swims 

 again, rests, and so on for probably a long time, but I could not 

 determine the period. The length of the animalcule is 7[i. One 

 sees easily the anteriorly placed nucleus, and behind a large con- 

 tractile vesicle, sometimes with an accessory one; a short proto- 

 plasmic collar is also present. The entire process, from the moment 

 when both individuals are distinctly separated but yet quite near 

 each other, to the darting away of the little flagellated animalcule, 

 has lasted but six or seven minutes. As for the lower individual, 

 which remained in the cell, it expanded in a few minutes also. 



But things are often quite different: the young animalcule, which 

 has just disengaged from the cell, instead of darting forward, re- 

 mains quiet for a time, as if hesitating, then, with a few very weak 

 downward beatings of the flagellum, slips along the exterior wall of 

 the shell it has just left, and soon settles quite near, lying along the 

 mucilaginous covering of the Zygnema (Plate VI, fig. 24, a). How- 

 ever, it very soon stands up straight on the jelly (Plate VI, fig. 24, 6), 

 and ten minutes after the first contact with the substratum it is 

 already seen to have produced a very short root (c), which soon 

 will reach the cellulose wall {d, e, /). But during that time also, 

 the first rudiments of the new envelope are deposited, a thin film 

 around the body, along which the animalcule soon rises, leaving 

 the empty posterior end of the capsule behind. In fig. 23, which 

 is an enlargement of / in fig. 24, the body is seen to swell out later- 

 ally, so as to press everywhere on the anterior part of the cell and 

 enlarge it, somewhat like a potter who moulds his clay, but in- 

 stead of a finger, the whole body is here employed. A little later 

 (Plate VI, fig. 24, g), the body has retracted a little, the widened 

 borders of the capsule are free, and are even too much expanded 

 but will soon contract a little. The animalcule, however, moves 

 more and more upward, and finally shapes up the aperture of the 




126 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART I 



cell, very likely in the same manner as will be described in the next 

 species; but I could not follow the events to the end, owing to the 

 animalcule being lost by accident. 



But such a division into equal parts is not the only one that can 

 be observed. I happened twice to meet with quite another process. 

 Instead of an equal transverse division of the individual, a very 

 small portion only was seen to detach; first a little bud (Plate VI, 

 fig. 25, a) at the anterior end of the body, then (Plate VI, fig. 25, b), 

 after complete separation, a spherical little being was formed, hardly 

 5[i. in diameter, with a long flagellum and a normal contractile vesicle; 

 then it lengthened into a little flagellate, whose small size was the 

 only character to distinguish it from the normal individuals. I 

 could not, however, follow the little swimming organisms very 

 far, and cannot suggest any explanation of the phenomena. Per- 

 haps the cases were purely pathological. 



Encystment was often observed. 7 The body becomes a yellow- 

 ish olivet green, then a golden yellow, and finally brown; a mem- 

 brane has gradually been secreted, which grows finally very thick; 

 at first it is transparent enough to allow of the contractile vesicle 

 to be distinctly seen, but finally it looks quite opaque. A very 

 curious fact which remains to be noted (Plate VI, fig. 26) is that 

 up to the completion of the construction of the cyst, the anterior 

 part is open, and from the opening are seen still protruding either 

 the collar or both the collar and the flagellum. Only when the 

 construction is entirely finished, these plasmatic appendages 

 begin to retreat, disappearing in the cyst itself; this latter, then, 

 is seen to be cylindrical, or somewhat swollen in the middle (Plate 

 VI, fig. 27), and may be compared to a cannon shell, provided 

 anteriorly with a circular opening, which also, however, will soon 

 be shut. Old cysts, in fact, generally have no opening, yet some- 

 times an anterior aperture is visible, but in empty cysts only, 

 whose contents have very likely been liberated. 



The encystment takes place inside the capsule, yet sometimes 

 cysts are met with which are completely free from any surrounding 

 envelope, and, besides, are provided with a short yellowish stem 

 attaching them to the jelly. The fact might perhaps be explained 



7 Lemmermann (27), in his diagnosis of the genus Salpingoeca, speaks of the 

 cysts in the following terms: "Cysts inside the capsule spherical or oval, with 

 a thin membrane or naked." My observations on Salpingoeca polygonatum 

 are such as to furnish us with new or different data. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 127 



by the encystment of swimming naked specimens, which hardly 

 arriving into contact with the Zygnema, encysted directly, rather than 

 building their normal envelope. Plate VI, fig. 28, which also rep- 

 resents a cyst of Salpingoeca polygonatum, such as I have seen several 

 times, formed during the night from specimens which had been seen 

 expanded the evening before, shows yet another kind of cyst. The 

 animalcules in these cases contract into a perfect spherule, yellowish 

 and shining, and besides a thin shell has been constructed also, but 

 balloon-like and without any opening at all. 



A few words might be added here, about the taxonomy. In 

 Salpingoeca, a very large genus and one which soon will . become 

 much larger still, the form of the capsule is very constant, and fur- 

 nishes a very good â€” perhaps the only good â€” diagnostic character. 

 Now I could find nowhere such a description as might apply to the 

 species just described. It is very near to Salp. gracilis J. Clark, 

 but the capsule in that species is not cylindrical, being rather drawn 

 out into a long narrow point, which appearance I never could detect 

 in Salp. polygonatum. 



Salpingoeca lepidula sp. n. Plate VI, figs. 29-33; Plate VII, figs. 34-40. 



As stated in the preceding chapter, it is sometimes very difficult 

 to come to a precise determination of the species in the genus Sal- 

 pingoeca; and only after much hesitation have I come to the con- 

 clusion that the present form ought to be described as new. It is, 

 in fact, very nearly related to Salp. buetschlii Lemmermann, butin 

 this latter, the larger size as well as the more rounded and swollen 

 contour, and, more than all, the very considerable enlargement of 

 the cup -like opening, do not allow identification with the present 

 species. The affinity would be more evident with Salp. ampho- 

 ridium S. Clark, and also Salp. vaginicola Stein, at least as Burck (6) 

 figures them in his 1909 work, 8 but in these the form of the capsule 

 is not the same, being more like S. buetschlii in general appearance, 

 and having a narrow pedicle which is not present in Salp. lepidula; 

 this latter, also, always possesses two contractile vacuoles. 



However it may be, the species which we are now going to con- 

 sider was found covering in great quantities the threads of a Nos- 

 toccacean, itself abundant in one of the aquaria of the Zoological 

 Laboratory at Geneva. 



8 In Pascher's "Siisswasser-Flora" (27), these two species are figured on p. 82. 

 but with quite a different form from that given by Burck. It is quite possible, 

 indeed, that Burck had studied new forms, which it would have been advantge- 

 ous to give as such. 




128 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART 1 



The capsule (Plate VI, fig. 29), about lAy. in height, has the shape 

 of an urn, elegantly lengthened, resting by a broad, truncated base 

 on a very distinct flattened cushion, which itself is applied to the 

 substratum. From that flattened base, the lateral curve first some- 

 what contracts, but very soon dilates regularly, up to a distance 

 a little above the middle of the height of the shell; then contracts 

 again, to finally dilate in an expanded border. The protoplasmic 

 body, rounded behind and itself elegantly urn-shaped, fills only 

 half of the shell; the nucleus is very distinct, as a bluish spherule 

 about the anterior third of the body; two contractile vesicles are 

 found, one right and the other left, one posterior and the other 

 inferior, and they regularly alternate in their function, emptying 

 about each third minute; one of them, somewhat larger, seems to 

 be the principal one, the other being accessory. The f lagellum, about 

 1 3^2 times as long as the body, is most of the time visible only up to 

 the middle of its length, on account of the rapid vibration of its 

 anterior portion. The protoplasmic collar, which is particularly 

 interesting, is mostly found with the appearance normal in Cras- 

 pedomonadina, being like a funnel, whose height may be equal to 

 that of the animalcule itself; but this protoplasmic funnel is sub- 

 ject to extraordinary deformations. The peculiar accumulation of 

 very pure ectoplasm which generally fills the funnel all around 

 the flagellum is seen, for instance, to move up along the funnel 

 itself (Plate VII, fig. 40), or the very thin film of hyaline plasma 

 which surrounds the plasmatic neck â€” perhaps the "Schleimhulle" 

 or mucilaginous layer Burck speaks of â€” expands and covers the 

 exterior surface; and the collar itself, now persisting, now collapsing 

 or getting mixed with the invading ectoplasm, takes on the most 

 diverse appearances. Plate VII, fig. 37, for instance, shows a short- 

 ened, thickened collar, whose border has especially thickened; in 

 fig. 38, the same structures are represented, one minute later than 

 in fig. 37; in fig. 39, at the same time that the ectoplasm expands 

 on the inside of the wall of the collar, it climbs up along the fla- 

 gellum; in fig. 40, the ectoplasmic film it seen left and right climb- 

 ing upwards, many more figures might have been drawn, showing 

 the most varied structure, for instance a film of plasma moving up 

 on one side only and leaving the other free, or a big plasmatic spher- 

 ule filling the entire opening of the capsule. Plate VII, fig. 36 

 gives an idea of a very peculiar process, which I was able once to 

 follow quite at length: a big mass of ectoplasmic matter protruded 

 from the mouth of the capsule, and became rounded, uniting with 

 the material of the now retracted collar, and after a few minutes, 

 from that protoplasmic spherule started lobes and thread-like pro- 

 tuberances, some of which got very thin and long, and at last reached 

 down to the supporting alga and there became affixed. After a 

 time, however, all the lobes and threads began retracting back- 

 wards. At 11 h., 10 min., the appearance was that shown by fig. 36, 

 Plate VII; at llh., 30 min., everything was beginning to re-enter 

 the shell; at llh., 35 min., the rudiments of a new funnel were seen 






1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 129 



to be expanding upwards ; at 1 1 h . , 45 min. , the collar was normal again, 

 and the flagellum, which had for a time disappeared from sight, 

 extended freely in the axis of the funnel. 



The overflowings of plasmatic matter, which are frequently met 

 in this particular species, are very little known; in some forms 

 similar facts have been mentioned, and Burck. who, however, did 

 not happen to meet with any such cases, speaks of the subject in 

 the following words: "I have not found in normal individuals such 

 formation of pseudopodia as Sav. Kent says he sometimes met 

 with. According to this observer, Choanoflagellata may even pass 

 through amoeboid stages. Zacharias assigns some importance to 

 the pseudopodia in the capture of food, and does not hesitate to 

 call them organs of prehension. France also observed Lobopodia 

 in several places on the body. In my opinion such structures occur 

 only in wounded individuals, which are not far from death." 



I do not think such occurrences must necessarily be associated 

 with a state of disease, but could not help sometimes observing a 

 certain coincidence between the development of these pseudopodia 

 and the abundance of food, the animalcules capturing then with 

 increased quickness very small special organisms (sulfureous algae?) 

 which were extremely abundant all around. But this way of cap- 

 turing food is certainly exceptional; the nutritive elements are 

 mostly thrown down straight upon the plasmatic funnel, either on 

 its outer surface or more often on the inner surface. When the 

 prey are very small, they seem to be digested inside the wall of the 

 collar itself; a small shining globule, for instance, such as was mostly 

 the case, was seen to lose by and by the sharpness of its outline, 

 then to swell up, turn pale, and at last disappear, without having 

 moved at any time from the place it occupied. But when the prey 

 are caught quite near the bottom of the funnel, a vacuole immedi- 

 ately forms around them, and they are quickly seen to disappear 

 downwards. In one particular case, I saw a small shining particle 

 fall on the naked neck of an animalcule that had not yet constructed 

 more than half its shell; it was immediately caught in a vacuole, 

 and slowly slipped down along the surface of the body, to stop after 

 five minutes quite near the posterior extremity (Plate VI, fig. 33). 

 The downward course seemed to have been effected in a spiral line, 

 but I no more than Burck could detect the least sign of a fine spiral 

 tracing, itself representing, as France will have it, the border of a 

 spirally coiled funnel. 




130 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART I 



Burck (6: page 183) discusses in a few lines the evacuation of 

 foecal material: " As regards defecation, my opinion is the same as 

 that of Clark and Butschli, who observed the elimination of digested 

 food to take place very near the base of the flagellum inside the 

 plasmatic collar." And further on he adds: "An evacuation of 

 ingesta at any point of the body surface, as Fisch supposes it to 

 occur, is certainly not correct." Though agreeing with these 

 statements in general, I should propose a slight restriction concern- 

 ing the last of these conclusions: if it must be considered certain 

 that the evacuation of foeces is not possible at all points of the 

 body indiscriminately, an exception ought to be made at least for 

 the plasmatic funnel; I have often seen captured granules (which 

 very likely were not to the taste of the animalcule) slowly glide 

 upwards, and when near the very border of the funnel, be suddenly 

 hurled away (as if by a sharp undulation of the border?),, and curi- 

 ously enough, these very small granules or microbes, which were 

 probably provided with invisible flagella, after having proved quite 

 inert and unmoved as long as they were included in the vacuole, 

 when cast out at once began to toss about in a rapid dance, soon 

 disappearing. 



On the 9th and 10th of February, I met with a considerable num- 

 ber of small naked Flagellates (Plate VII, fig. 34), which could be 

 referred without any hesitation to this same species; the size, the 

 two contractile vesicles, nucleus, flagellum, protoplasmic collar, 

 everything, in fact, indicated specimens which had left the shell 

 and had adopted a free life. They swam quickly about, in small 

 circles, without ever getting very far away; or they went straight 

 forwards, for a distance hardly more than five or six times their own 

 length, then stopped for a second or two, darted forwards again, 

 and so on for a long time, proceeding by sudden intermittent ad- 

 vances. Perhaps some correlation might be supposed to exist be- 

 tween this sort of progression and a very curious fact, other exam- 

 ples of which are hardly to be expected in the whole series of the 

 Flagellata, but which could easily be ascertained in each of the 

 specimens observed, namely, that the flagellum, instead of drawing 

 the body, was pushing it from behind; the flagellum, in fact, is pos- 

 terior. But the small animalcule has itself changed in shape, it 

 has shortened, and at the same time has taken the form of a top, 

 pointed in front (in front when swimming, in reality it is the hind 

 part of the body), and as for the plasmatic collar, it is seen reduced 

 to one-quarter of its former length, but is rather thick and very 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA 131 



distinct and still. The most interesting fact about that change in 

 shape is perhaps the pointed extremity which never exists in the 

 resting stage, and certainly seems an adaptation for swimming. 



Plate VI, fig. 30 illustrates a case of division, nearly completed, 

 such as I met with on the 8th of February. Very likely the process 

 had been the same as that described in the previous chapter, for 

 Saljringoeca polygonatum. The new Flagellate, ovoid in shape, is 

 seen about to draw its flagellum from the shell it has just left, and 

 beginning to glide down towards the supporting Alga. It is seen 

 about $i of a minute later, nearly touching the ground but with 

 its flagellum still attached to the border of the cup (Plate VI, fig. 31) ; 

 one minute more, and the flagellum was free, pointing straight up- 

 wards, the protoplasmic collar had begun to develop, and the in- 

 ferior extremity had become pointed. Very likely the rudiments 

 of a new capsule were already beginning to appear; but at that 

 very moment, the supporting Nostoc passed into some rubbish and 

 was lost to sight. Other specimens, however, were found that 

 same day and the next, at the stage just described (Plate VI, fig. 32), 

 and they allowed of further observations: 9 



Immediately after fixation, the little body takes the form of a 

 long top, with a distinct plasmatic collar, in which food particles 

 are already caught; but the characteristic posterior point immedi- 

 ately changes into a very fine thread, and as the body gets higher 

 and higher, leaving the ground behind, the thread gets longer, being 

 just sufficient to prevent the escape of the Flagellate, but certainly 

 unable to keep it upright. The body, in fact, is kept upright by 

 a very thin envelope, which has already formed, the appearance 

 being" that of an egg in its cup (in Fig. 33, Plate VI, dotted lines 

 indicate the rudiments of the shell). The new envelope is so thin, 

 that one hardly can detect it, like two fine lines left and right of 

 the point of fixation, and which diverge more and more to meet 

 the body in its most swollen portion. The animalcule, in fact, 

 rose while propping itself against the very borders of the partly 

 constructed cell; but after a normal height has been reached the 

 body ceases to get higher, the posterior thread disappears, the ani- 

 malcule swells and moulds its body into the very form the shell 

 will invest afterwards, and deposits all over its own surf ace a very 

 thin pellicula, then retracts when the pellicula has become hard. 



â€¢Several of these specimens seemed from their particularly large size to rep- 

 resent adults, which had left their shell without previously dividing. 




132 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PaRT J. 



The capsule is now nearly complete, and its walls soon will grow 

 thicker; but one thing is wanting, namely the neck, or rather its 

 widened border; and now â€” if two observations, both agreeing, 

 suffice for the statement â€” the difficulty is removed in a very in- 

 genious way. The animalcule lengthens somewhat, then bends 

 first to one side (Plate VII, fig. 35), then to another side, leaving 

 some material behind, acting in fact like the finger of a potter 

 about to broaden the aperture of a cup, but here the displacements 

 are exceedingly slow, very likely because, before leaving the con- 

 tact portion of the border, the animalcule must wait till the de- 

 posited film is hardened. 



From my observations, the construction of the capsule takes a 

 long time, from morning to evening; but it is quite possible that 

 in nature things go much quicker, owing to more favorable con- 

 ditions. 



Chrysamoeba radians Klebs. Plate VII, flgs. 41-44. 



Chrysamoeba radians, which Klebs described in 1892 (21), is not 

 fare, and yet remains little-known; every observer has seen it, but 

 very few have gone to the trouble of studying it at length. This 

 study, it must be said, is little encouraging in itself, doubts and 

 uncertainties are met with on many points, contractile vesicle, 

 chromatophore, flagellum, division, capture of food, even the very 

 existence of this Flagellate as a distinct species has been doubted, 

 and so many little organisms are met with, whose study looks more 

 profitable, that this particular one is easily neglected. 



Scherffel, in 1901 (29), treats in a few pages of this little organ- 

 ism, and says in regard to the flagellum: "Besides the pseudqpodia 

 a swinging flagellum is sometimes seen, probably only when the 

 amoeba is about to change to the Flagellate state, but as a rule there 

 is none." A little further on, he says concerning animal feeding: 

 "Klebs was not able to observe the capture of foreign bodies, and 

 Senn says, in 1900, holozoic nutrition has not yet been observed. 

 Yet in 1890 I had observed in a vacuole a little rod with the appear- 

 ance of a Bacterium. This year in the spring I was able to verify 

 the direct capture of green Algae and the evacuation of brown 

 undigested remnants of food." Later on, in 1911 (30) the same 

 observer, in his chapter under the title "Chrysamoeba and Chromu- 

 lina nebulosa," seems to doubt his former observations about a 

 flagellate stage, thinking the observed Flagellates might not have 

 belonged to Chrysamoeba. "I consider more and more as probable 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 133 



the opinion that the genus Chrysamoeba is in fact a purely amoeba- 

 like form, with never any flagella, comparable to those of organisms 

 like Chromulina or even Ochromonas, but owing to this very absence 

 of flagella, these forms are so characteristic in themselves that it 

 seems advisable to retain Chrysamoeba as representing an inde- 

 pendent genus." 



Pascher, in the fascicle of his "Siisswasser-Flora" (27), which 

 treats of the Chrysomonadina and is dated 1913, does not even 

 mention the name Chrysamoeba in his list of accepted genera but 

 only devotes a few lines to the subject, in a foot-note on page 13: 

 "Klebs has created the name Chrysamoeba for Chromulina-like 

 Chrysomonadina with two large chromatophores and an anterior 

 contractile vesicle, which may turn into Rhizopods and develop 

 pseudopodia after losing their flagella." In the same work, on 

 page 90, Pascher comes again to the subject, and considers this 

 same organism as belonging to the genus Rhizochrysis, "an arti- 

 ficially created genus that includes several Chrysomonadina of differ- 

 ent origin, whose Flagellate-stage has been lost or in which, if pres- 

 ent, it is not yet known." Chrysamoeba, such as Scherffel under- 

 stood it, has now become Rhizochrysis scherffelii Pascher. 10 



During these last four years, while looking for Infusoria, 

 I have often met with Chrysamoeba, in several localities and in all 

 seasons of the year, and at the end of 1914 and the beginning of 

 1915, I devoted some time to its study (perhaps it is not quite use- 

 less to state that most of my collections of material were made 

 after breaking a thick layer of ice), and was able to come to some 

 interesting conclusions. The little organism I had to do with was, 

 I must say, at the same time, Chrysamoeba radians Klebs, Rhizo- 

 chrysis scherffelii Pascher, and also the Chrysamoeba-like Chromu- 

 lina Scherffel speaks of. In my opinion, one single organism i? 

 here concerned, Chrysamoeba radians Klebs, a very distinct and 

 characteristic species and genus. 



Let us first insist on the fact that Chrysamoeba is a colonial or- 

 ganism. Scherffel, in 1908, sometimes found "large colonies of 

 Chrysamoeba-like amoebae, where more than a hundred typical 

 and well-developed specimens, all without any flagellum, were in- 

 cluded in an amorphous, free-swimming jelly." At Pinchat, these 

 colonies were very abundant, sometimes very much reduced and 



10 According to Pascher, the Chrysamoeba which Scherffel observed is not the 

 same as that described by Klebs. 




134 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART I 



with only a few individuals, sometimes with 50 or more, and even 

 100; in one particular case, one of the colonies seemed to contain 

 about 200 little amoebae; there are no limits, in fact, to the size 

 of the colony, and as for the isolated specimens, which, it must be 

 said, are always met with in greater numbers, they may very well 

 be supposed to have been detached from the colony. 



If we now look at one of these little Chrysamoebae (Plate VII, 

 fig. 41), we shall recognize a small amoeba, 15 or 18(jl in diameter, 

 star-shaped or made more or less irregular by thin clear pseudo- 

 podia, finely granulated superficially, sometimes bifurcate or rarely 

 branching, and whose length can be double the diameter of the 

 body. These amoebae very slowly change in shape, and hardly in 

 position, and the pseudopodia are seen to change also, retracting 

 or reappearing, but without seemingly playing an important part 

 in the locomotion of the animal. 



The plasma, very clear, and often with many small vacuoles, 

 contains a pale nucleus, whose structure is rather exceptional; most 

 generally, a central caryosom is to be seen, around which is a nar- 

 row annular ring of light liquid substance, then an exterior ring of 

 more compact matter; sometimes, however, only small vacuoles 

 are seen in a homogenous grey nuclear substance. The nucleus 

 is generally indistinct, hidden from view by the more evident 

 chromatophore. This latter is in the form of a large golden-brown 

 lamina, crescent-curved; it very often looks double, being first 

 lengthened, then bent in its middle so as to acquire the form of 

 the letter V. The contractile vesicle, very small and in an eccen- 

 tric position, often can hardly be distinguished; its activity is seen 

 to be very slow, and some patience is needed to become sure of its 

 periodic emptying and filling, but I could ascertain that it func- 

 tions normally, though its reappearance after closing is very slow. 

 Here and there are seen scattered in the clear plasma more or less 

 numerous small shining granules, and sometimes a large rounded 

 mass of leucosine is found, of a very pure bluish grey. There is no 

 stigma, and as for a flagellum, only in very rare instances is one to 

 be seen, extremely thin and very slowly undulating; and its occur- 

 rence is always a sign that the amoeba is beginning to prepare for 

 its swimming Flagellate form. 



It is rather curious that the question of the capture of food should 

 have been so long obscure, and still is so. Klebs could not ascer- 

 tain its reality, nor did Senn observe more about it. Scherffel, how- 

 ever, as we said before, proved the fact, leaving no doubt at all. 

 For my part, I observed in many instances the capture of small 

 green particles, and more especially certain large (sulfureous?) two- 

 segmented bacteria, which happened to come into contact with 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 135 



the amoeba and immediately were enclosed in a vacuole, soon dis- 

 appearing inside the body, sometimes the pseudopodia were the 

 means of capture, and the bacteria were seen to glide along them 

 towards the central plasma. On two special occasions, diatoms 

 were met with, nearly as long as the Chrysamoeba itself, and in 

 course of digestion. 



Such is the amoeba form of Chrysamoeba radians; but there is 

 another form, that of a typical Flagellate, which Klebs had already 

 seen and Scherffel afterwards described, only to doubt later his own 

 observation and believe in a confusion with another organism. 

 My observations, however, are such as to leave no obscurity. Chrys- 

 amoeba really passes through a flagellate state, or rather, one might 

 say, voluntarily abandons one state for another. I have made, 

 between December 29 and January 3, several experiments on the 

 subject, which all gave the same results, five colonies of Chrysamoeba, 

 nine, thirteen, twenty-four and fifty specimens in number respec- 

 tively, were isolated on five excavated slides in clear pure water, 

 and the amoebae were seen one after another to leave the jelly, 

 which after two, three and four days was quite free of any tenant, 

 while small Flagellata were swimming about. As an example, I 

 may give here a textual copy of the brief notes taken for the small- 

 est of these colonies : 



Dec. 29. 12 o'clock. Nine fine specimens in their jelly; not one of them 

 showing any flagellum; all are expanded as small star-like amoebae, 

 15 to 18[X in diameter. 



4:30 o'clock. The same. 

 Dec. 30. 8:30 o'clock. Only four are left, a single one of them still in the 

 star form; the others are rounded, and two of them quivering; on one ol 

 them 1 can distinguish the slowly undulating flagellum. 



9 o'clock. The undulations are more rapid. 



1 o'clock. Nothing is left in the jelly, and a small flagellated individual is 

 swimming about. 



On three or four different occasions, I was able to follow in one 

 single animalcule, from beginning to end, the passage to the fla- 

 gellated state. The amoeba slowly retracts its pseudopodia, then 

 becomes spherical, and begins quivering from time to time, but 

 without the flagellum, still too delicate, being yet visible; but it 

 soon becomes distinct, and ten minutes after the first quivering 

 of the spherule, it is seen rapidly to vibrate at the anterior pole 

 of the now ovoid or pyriform animalcule; this latter then moves, 

 leaves the jelly, and goes in a straight course, revolving on its long 

 axis and swinging in a pendulum-like movement. 




136 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART I 



This Chrysamoeba-FlageWate (Plate VII, fig. 43), 18 to 20[x in 

 length, is ovate, with the broader extremity either anterior or poste- 

 rior according to the individuals, sometimes it is somewhat stretched 

 behind. It contains a distinct, curved chromatophore, a small con- 

 tractile vesicle near the anterior extremity, very small shining gran- 

 ules, and often a large spherule of pure leucosine; the nucleus gen- 

 erally remains indistinct, hidden in the curve of the golden-green 

 chromatophore; the flagellum, very thin, hardly longer than the 

 body, takes its origin from a very small notch, above which the 

 anterior extremity rises in a small prominence. 



After swimming about for a time whose duration I could not 

 make sure of, 11 the Flagellate again comes to the amoeba stage, and 

 contracts into a spherule (Plate VII, fig. 42), the surface of which 

 soon begins showing small projecting denticulations, then each of 

 these protuberances develops into a very thin pseudopod, which 

 soon thickens, at the same time the flagellum gets more indistinct, 

 it is thin, flabby, and remains for a long time at rest; now and then, 

 however, it seems to come to life again, and oscillates for a brief 

 moment; and finally it disappears, either collapsed, or rather â€” if 

 a single observation entitles to ajudgment â€” resolves into a chaplet 

 of tiny pearls, which are lost by and by. 



Division has rarely been observed. As far as I know, Klebs and 

 Scherffel alone have mentioned a few cases, and one cannot but be 

 somewhat surprised at the rarity of the occurrence, when thinking 

 of these big colonies whose constituent members might be sup- 

 posed to arise from a single primary individual. As it is, I was 

 able to verify a few cases of division, but only one of these could 

 be studied at length. The animalcule was found already somewhat 

 stretched in length (Plate VII, fig. 44, a), and was provided with 

 two chromatophores, still united, which together had the shape 

 of a W; to the left, a big mass of leucosine; to the right, a very large 

 vacuole. Two minutes after that first observation, the chroma- 

 tophores were separated, the vacuole had grown bigger still, and 

 the leucosine globule had elongated (Plate VII, fig. 44, b); a little 

 later, the 8-form of the body was much more apparent (Plate VII, 

 fig. 44, c), the leucosine body was still more elongated; the big vacu- 



11 The resting or amoeba state, whose duration is not difficult to notice, can 

 last for days, but this duration may also be much reduced, and 1 have seen for 

 instance a flagellated individual transform into an amoeba and develop pseu- 

 dopods; but two hours later the little organism had disappeared again as if 

 not satisfied with the new condition. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA 137 



ole, after having acquired an immense size, burst and disappeared 

 (Plate VII, fig. 44, d); the leucosine globule became divided into 

 two parts, one of which passed to each of the new individuals just 

 when the bridge between them was breaking (Plate VII, fig. 44, e) ; 

 and the two new amoebae slowly went their way (Plate VII, fig. 44, 

 /). The whole process, from a to/, had lasted twenty minutes. At no 

 time had it been possible to detect the least indication of a flagel- 

 lum. Scherffel, in the first case he studied, observed (1911, p. 315) 

 that one of the new individuals, long before the separation, already 

 possessed a slowly oscillating flagellum, but later on, when he again 

 had the opportunity to observe a second case of division, he found 

 that neither of the new individuals ever developed any. For my 

 part, I consider it quite possible that in both cases Scherffel had 

 seen rightly: in the first one, the amoeba immediately prepared for 

 the flagellate stage, in the second it remained an amoeba. 



But if this case of division is the only one I could study at length, 

 there is another which I should like to mention, which though not 

 proving successful at last, is indeed hardly less interesting. The 

 amoeba, when found, was already narrowed in the middle, and in 

 possession of two distinct chromatophores, each of them in a V form, 

 but united together by their adjacent extremities, like a W; so firmly 

 united, in fact, that when but a narrow bridge alone separated the 

 two new individuals, one of the chromatophores, which should have 

 entered the new individual, had not been able to follow the move- 

 ment, and remained in what we might call the "old" individual, 

 while the "new" animalcule, quite deprived of any green matter, 

 was just going away. A very narrow bridge, however, a mere 

 protoplasmic. thread, was still uniting the two amoebae; but danger 

 was coming, an air-bubble approaching more and more, and to get 

 rid of it I added some water to the side of the cover. The bubble 

 retracted, but, as a consequence of a violent temporary shaking, 

 the couple seemed to give up dividing, the bridge got wider, and 

 by and by the new pale individual slowly "re-entered" the old one, 

 after a moment a single amoeba was seen, with two chromatophores 

 instead of one. But without that disastrous commotion, certainly 

 an entire separation was quite near, and the new amoeba would 

 have been colorless, just like the specimen which Scherffel once 

 found, and figures on Plate VI of his 1901 work. 



To conclude with Chrysamoeba, I ought perhaps to speak of the 

 encystment. Some observations have been made which allowed 

 curious conclusions, so eurious, indeed, that ... it would be 




138 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART I 



better not to mention them, as possibly they relate to some other 

 organism. 



Chrysopyxis bipes Stein. Plate VI11, figs. 45-49. 



"Chrysopyxis bipes has often been discussed in the literature, 

 and yet seems to me not to be at all well understood in its organi- 

 zation." Such are the words with which, in 1911 (30), Scherffel 

 begins his chapter about Chrysopyxis, and though the following 

 pages of the work threw a good deal of light on the most in- 

 teresting points, it will not be quite useless to report some further 

 observations here. But before relating my own experiences, I 

 should like to reproduce the lines with which Scherffel introduces 

 the subject: 



"According to the existing descriptions, Chrysopyxis is a fla- 

 gellated Chrysomonad, provided with a shell. According to Stein, 

 the animalcule is in possession of two flagella. Other observers, 

 like Lemmermann, and Pascher, are of the opinion that there is 

 only one flagellum. Iwanoff (1899) tried to explain these different 

 statements by the fact that normally a single flagellum exists, but 

 that this under special circumstances appears ravelled out in 

 threads, so as to look branched. The two flagella of Stein would 

 thus be reduced to a single branched one. Pascher (1909) accepts 

 Iwanoff's opinion, and gives in his Plate XI, fig. 26, a hypothetical 

 drawing of a specimen in which the individual threads of the 

 branched flagellum are wound up together at the base, and so ex- 

 plain the simple, thick, basal part of the flagellum. I had myself 

 a good many occasions to observe Chrysopyxis in life, but I never 

 succeeded in distinguishing an undulating flagellum, nor that 

 "ravelling into threads" (Zerfaserung) which Iwanoff and Pascher 

 speak of, and the existence of which I must confess to being very 

 skeptical about." 



Chrysopyxis is often met with, but my observations upon that 

 interesting little Chrysomonad nearly all refer to a single station, 

 that same shallow marsh at Pinchat where so many Protozoa have 

 been found, and where in the spring of 1916 it was seen to cover 

 in great numbers the long threads of Zygnema. 



The capsule (Plate VII, fig. 45), about 13;x in length, is ovoid in 

 shape, and at the same time pyriform, its anterior extremity being 

 drawn into a very short tube, which, however, is hardly distinct 

 enough to deserve the name. This little case stands upright on 

 the vegetal filament, posteriorly drawn to one side in a very thin 

 thread which turns down around the Zygnema, and describes a 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 139 



complete circle to rejoin the base of the cell on the opposite side. 12 

 In most of the specimens, the capsule is quite colorless, but with 

 age it grows yellow; it is mainly of a cellulose nature, as is easily 

 shown by the chloride of zinc reaction. Iwanoff (19), however, 

 speaks of the violet coloration as only in the shell, the annular ring 

 remaining colorless. Yet I have seen that very ring distinctly 

 colored, and probably IwanofFs negative results were due to a 

 defective quality of the reagent. 



The protoplast itself, which hardly fills one-half of the capsule, 

 contains a large olive-green or olive-golden chromatophore,intheform 

 of a curved transverse lamina; then very small pure and shining 

 globules, often a large spherule of leucosine, and, in the anterior 

 part, a large vacuole, or sometimes two. Does this vacuole, or 

 one of them, represent here a contractile vesicle? Iwanoff indicated 

 it as such; but in one of the observed individuals I happened to 

 see, at the posterior extremity, a very distinct vacuole suddenly 

 collapsing, just like a normal contractile vesicle, and it may be 

 asked if its true position would not be there, the anterior vacuole 

 being concerned with the capture of food? A nucleus was not 

 seen, being hidden, very likely, in the concavity of the green lamina. 

 Iwanoff, however, mentions the existence of "a small nucleus, some- 

 what above the middle." As to the pseudopodia, which we mast 

 consider somewhat more at length, the spherical protoplast does 

 not reach with its upper extremity so far as the aperture of the 

 shell; it appears, in fact, suspended inside the cavity, and held in 

 place by means of a plasmatic stalk, which arising from the median 

 upper point of the body, goes straight to the mouth of the shell. 

 But there, at the very opening, this stalk abruptly divides into 

 four, five, six, and up to eight lateral threads, which diverge in all di- 

 rections ; they are very thin, smooth and rigid, genuine pseudopodia, in 

 fact, and they behave as such; tiny microbes are caught, slowly glide 

 towards the mouth of the shell, then reach the central stalk, along 

 which they are seen to descend with a ten-fold rapidity. It often 

 happens, when the fishing district proves rich, that the captured 

 microbes come down in too great numbers, and are then obliged 

 to accumulate, waiting for their turn; it is, indeed, a very interesting 

 sight to notice them swallowed one after another down the main 

 trunk (Plate VII, fig. 49). 



I have never been able, among these rigid pseudopodia, to detect 

 any appearance of a flagellum, nor any transformation of a rigid 

 thread into a swinging one, and my own observations entirely con- 

 firm those of Scherffel (30), when he says: "Then also with Chry- 

 sopyxis animal-like ingestion of food occurs!" and when he adds: 



12 According to Iwanoff (19), the construction of this ring is effected in a very 

 curious manner: the animalcule, in the state of a naked zoospore, turns several 

 times around the Zygnema thread, depositing behind itself a fine train of muci- 

 laginous matter, which soon will harden into a complete ring.

"The protoplasmic body does not possess any flagellum, any more 

 than does the amoeba stage of Chrysamoeba." 

 "The protoplasmic body does not possess any flagellum, no more 

 than does the amoeba stage of Chrysamoeba." 



But here also, as in Chrysamoeba, a flagellated state may appear, 

 not only after an act of division, 13 but as the result of a total trans- 

 formation, a process hitherto unknown in Chrysopyxis, but which 

 I happened to verify on several occasions: the body becomes spheri- 

 cal, the pseudopodiar etract, and the little spherule begins quivering 

 in its cell, a flagellum, in fact, is there already; then the spherule 

 lengthens, reaches the aperture, becomes swollen anteriorly, so as 

 to press on the tubular opening and force the exit (Plate VII, fig. 47), 

 and finally leaves the cell. It looks now almost like a small fla- 

 gellated Chrysamoeba, yet relatively broader and more rounded, 

 with an anterior rapidly swinging flagellum, a normal chromato- 

 phore, small granules and often a leucosine body (Plate VII, fig. 48). 



Both figs. 46 and 49, Plate VII, and especially the latter figure, 

 represent cells which are entirely without the normal tubular ex- 

 tremity. A good many such specimens were met with, generally 

 smaller than the type, about 11 or 12[a in length as well as in 

 breadth. Were they young individuals? or was it a different 

 species, perhaps Lauterborn's Chrysopyxis stenostoma (Susserwas- 

 ser-Flora," p. 28, fig. 43), which, however, is described as possess- 

 ing two chromatophores. At any rate, it is well to reproduce here 

 the words accompanying Pascher's diagnosis of Chrysopyxis: 

 "a genus too little studied, and whose several forms are relatively 

 little known." 



Hyalobryon ramosum Lauterborn. Plate VIII, flgs. 50-54. 



In that same marsh at Pinchat was often found, in every season 

 and often in great abundance, the Flagellate for which Lauterborn 

 (23) created the name Hyalobryon. "The present genus of Chryso- 

 monadina," says the German observer, "deserves its name rightly 

 to this extent, that it is positively difficult to distinguish clearly 



13 Plate VII, fig. 46 shows such a case of division, which is well known today, 

 whose process Pascher summarizes in the following words ("Susswasser-Flora," 

 p. 28): "Multiplication by longitudinal division of the protoplast, after which 

 one of the parts leaves the shell in the form of a zoospore with a single flagellum." 

 In this fig. 46, it is to be noted that, in spite of the process being already very 

 far advanced towards its end, one pseudopod was still to be seen, relatively 

 thick, and pointing straight up; microbes were still caught, and slowly glided 

 along towards the body. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 141 



even the outlines of the colonies; as a rule one sees only the numerous 

 golden-brown Flagellates, placed next to each other, without its 

 being possible to decide how they are arranged." 



" Hyalobryon constitutes, like the well-known Dinobryon, tree- 

 like or brush-like colonies, but which, different from the latter 

 genus, do not swim freely about, but are fixed on water-plants or 

 any other substratum. The number of the individuals united into 

 a colony is very variable and sometimes goes to a hundred. Like 

 Dinobryon the Flagellates inhabit special capsules, which here are 

 of a tubular form and often are more or less, even strongly, bent; 

 the basal extremity terminates in a short cone. Towards the an- 

 terior end, the tubes become somewhat narrower, and at their bor- 

 der look finely toothed. This apparent denticulation is due to 

 the fact that the Flagellates, which always stand near the aperture 

 of their capsule, periodically leave here a deposit in the shape of 

 new rings of growth, on the inside of the somewhat enlarged border. 

 As the process is often repeated, the tubes lengthen more and 

 more; and many of them are seen, whose anterior part is formed 

 of ten and more rings, resting cup-like in each other." 



My observations are such as to confirm in a general way those 

 of Lauterborn, but the accordance is not complete in some of the 

 details. In the Hyalobryon I had the tubes were never nar- 

 rowed near the summit; on the contrary, they were perfectly 

 cylindrical up to very near their distal extremity, where they some- 

 what expanded (Plate VIII, fig. 50) instead of narrowing. Lauter- 

 born's "Anwachsringe," or so-called "lines of growth," were mostly 

 absent; sometimes, however, they were present, either on some of 

 the members of the colony, or more rarely on nearly all of them, 

 but they could in no case be considered as rings of growth; they 

 were tubes, set in each other, each of them of some length (Plate 

 VIII, fig. 54). There was even no difficulty in ascertaining the 

 manner in which the construction had been accomplished; little 

 Flagellates approaching had undoubtedly become attached just 

 inside an empty tube, very near the opening and on one side only 

 of the wall, then they grew up, forming first a whistle-like, then a 

 regular, tube. Plate VIII, figure 54, shows this special arrange- 

 ment of the new tubes inside the old ones, and at the top is seen, 

 in the form of a simple sharp scale, the beginning of a tube whose 

 construction was not continued, the Flagellate having, it must be 

 supposed, left the place very soon after finding it. 



It would then be necessary to modify the terms used by Lauter- 




142 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART 1 



born concerning the fixation of these Flagellates: "While in Dino- 

 bryon the younger cells are set inside the inner border of the old 

 ones, in Hyalobryon it is the outside wall that is chosen as a point of 

 fixation, and this point is very far from the aperture." Now there 

 seems to be here some misunderstanding , Lauterborn is here speaking 

 of the fixation as quite a different thing from the "lines of growth," 

 which latter would in his opinion point to a single individual build- 

 ing a formal row of rings above each other, while according to my 

 observations there are no "lines of growth" at all, but the animal- 

 cules would settle down in two different ways: either inside empty 

 tubes, as we just described, or outside and generally very far away 

 from the opening, these latter individuals would enlarge the colony 

 in size and breadth, the former would only lengthen the existing 

 tubes. 



The second way, by simple juxtaposition, is by far the more fre- 

 quent of the two (atleastitwasatPinchat), and colonies are formed, 

 whose appearance is very curious and variable , now it is a branching 

 thicket, now the tubes seem to start from a single point (Plate VIII, 

 figs. 51, 52), now they are parallel to each other, now straight or 

 very often in a contorted bundle (Plate VIII, fig. 52). 



The small inhabitant of the tube is indeed of a very timid nature, 

 and leaves its tube at the first appearance of danger, the very trans- 

 portation of a colony from the general collection to an excavated 

 slide for purpose of better observation is enough to cause more 

 than half its members to escape during the journey, and those which 

 still are left also very soon take to flight. It is quite probable that 

 the animalcules are just as ready to settle down as they are to leave, 

 and empty bundles of tubes may very well get the preference, they 

 then affix themselves either against or inside the tubes, but in this 

 latter case quite near the opening, and according to the conditions 

 the changes may be of such frequency that after a time a formal set 

 of rings are seen one behind the other. 



As for the tubes themselves, whose length may reach as much as 

 150[x (Lauterborn speaks of 55\i) for only 5 or 6(x in breadth, they 

 are perfectly colorless, and "for an exact study it is necessary to 

 have recourse to staining, which does not present any difficulty, 

 as they very quickly absorb aniline colors" (Lauterborn). I may 

 add that Dahlia tincture instantly colors the tubes a very fine peach- 

 blossom tint, but this lasts only for a moment. 



The Flagellate, 18^ in length and 3 or 4 in breadth, is spindle- 

 shaped, with at its anterior extremity a short beak-like prolonga- 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 143 



tion, and, behind, it is drawn out into a point, itself continued in 

 a very thin thread, whose length may be nearly double that of the 

 fusiform body (Lauterborn calculates it to 12|jl; but I have seen 

 it attain 30;x and more), and which attaches by its extremity far 

 away on some point of the inner surface of the tube. This attach- 

 ing filament is highly retractile, and from time to time draws the 

 animalcule very far inside the tube. Its normal position is at some 

 little distance from the opening. In the anterior part of the body 

 is seen the chromatophore, a golden-brown lamina, but which only 

 appears distinct on one of its sides, where it is seen double becauses 

 of its recurving there on itself. Sometimes it looks broken in its 

 middle, and the appearance is that of two rods joining each other 

 at an angle. At its anterior extremity is a very small, but distinct 

 stigma. In the same part of the body is a small contractile vesicle 

 (Lauterborn found two), and behind the chromatophore lies gener- 

 ally a large, egg-shaped mass of leucosine; in the very pure and 

 transparent plasma, tiny shining granules are disseminated; a very 

 pale globular nucleus, with a small central caryosom, occupies the 

 middle of the body, being mostly very indistinct on account of the 

 chromatophore, in the folds of which it is lost. From the slight 

 notch that is seen at the anterior extremity, two fiagella arise; one 

 of them, the principal one, about as long as the body, swings in 

 rapid longitudinal vibrations, while the other, the accessory fla- 

 gellum, only 5 or 6[l in length, remains motionless at an angle of 

 35Â° to the former. 



A little further consideration is necessary as to the systematic 

 position of this small organism. Lauterborn did not unhesitatingly 

 propose this Flagellate as new. As far back as 1890, Imhof (18) had 

 described, with the name of Dinobryon buetschlii â€” but in a few 

 words only, and without any accompanying figure â€” a small Flagel- 

 late, very similar indeed to Lauterborn's Hyalobryon, but in this 

 form the tubes are expressly stated to be set one within another, 

 and nothing is said of the characteristic "rings of growth. 14 



The form I studied also looks rather different from Lauterborn's 

 Hyalobryon, and this typical insertion of the tubes, in place of Lauter- 

 born's "rings of growth," would seem to indicate another species, 

 perhaps Imhof's Dinobryon buetschlii? But Imhof insists on 

 the fact that in his Dinobryon "the anterior third part of the tube 

 grows gradually narrower, down to one -third of the diameter next to 

 the opening," while nothing of the sort is to be seen in Hyalobryon as 

 I could verify in hundreds of specimens. Perhaps a third species 



14 Stokes' Epipyxis sodalis (34), which presents some likeness to Hyalobryon, 

 seems to me,, even more perhaps than to Lauterborn, very different from Hyal.

is in question, or a particular variety, but the facts are not clear 

 enough to allow any definite conclusion. 



Cryptomonas ovata Ehrenberg. Plate VIII, figures 55-57. 



Pascher, on page 105 of the second fascicle of his "Siisswasser- 

 Flora," accompanies the diagnosis of the genus Cryptomonas with 

 the following reflections: "A very widely distributed genus, that 

 sometimes forms "water-flowers" (Wasserbliiten) and is frequently 

 associated with Euglenae ; is particularly frequent in water rich in 

 organic substances and in sewer refuse. Nearly all of the forms 

 are also planktonic. Only few of them are known, and an exact 

 study would furnish with a swarm of species." In a note at the 

 foot of the page, Pascher adds: "I hope to give within two years a 

 detailed monograph of the freshwater Cryptomonadinae." To my 

 knowledge, the work has not been published yet, and any informa- 

 tion about this interesting, somewhat paradoxal little group, might 

 have its importance. 



Cryptomonas is indeed found everywhere, but most of my 

 observations, dating from 1916, have been made on specimens from 

 that same marsh at Pinchat of which mention has so often been 

 made; later on, in January, 1917, a collection was studied from 

 another station, Rouelbeau, where individuals were found at rest, 

 enclosed in a gelatinous envelope, and often in course of division; 

 and lastly, in December, 1918, a special form from a pond at 

 Florissant, in the near neighborhood of Geneva, was studied again. 

 In all these different stations, the species was the same â€” the same, 

 at least, after determination by means of the keys in "Stisswasser- 

 Flora" â€” namely, Cryptomonas ovata; but such was the difference 

 between the forms of Pinchat and Rouelbeau on one side and Floris- 

 sant on the other, that one might ask if it was right indeed to re- 

 unite finally Ehrenberg's two species ovata and curvata into one 

 (ovata). The Pinchat-Rouelbeau type was in fact Crypt, ovata (with 

 the variety curvata Lemmermann), and the Florissant type was the 

 genuine Crypt, curvata Ehrenberg. 



Ehrenberg, on page 41 of his classical work (" Infusionsthier- 

 cheh"), gives the following diagnosis of Cryptomonas ovata: "Monad 

 with an oval carapace, with compressed body, oval, large, twice 

 as long as broad, fa millimeter in length, color green." Pascher 

 (Siisswasserflora, p. 105), in his diagnosis of the genus, describes 

 the general appearance in more precise terms: "Cell typically show- 

 ing dorso-ventral differentiation, with generally a more flattened 

 or even somewhat concave ventral side and often a highly convex 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 145 



dorsal side, which at the anterior end is not infrequently drawn 

 out into a point. Anterior end diagonally truncated. . . ." In 

 spite of all descriptions, however, it would be very difficult to recog- 

 nize a Cryptomonas without a few explanatory figures, so much 

 the more, that the form of the body is exceedingly variable, from 

 that of an egg to that, of a curved spindle. The size also varies 

 within very wide limits, most of the specimens measure from 30 to 

 55[x in length, but some are very much smaller. At the end of 

 September, for instance, a multitude of very small individuals sud- 

 denly appeared, which though certainly belonging to this species, 

 measured only from 12 to 13[x (Plate VIII, fig. 56), they were nearly 

 oval in form, but grew nearer and nearer the typical form, in the 

 same proportion as the size augmented. 



Let us now consider in its more intimate structure, such an indi- 

 vidual as is shown by Plate VIII, fig. 55, which represents fairly 

 well the typical Cryptomonas ovata. The organism is seen with 

 its ventral side to the right, the dorsal convex one to the left, 

 terminating in a point, or beak-like extremity, the posterior part of 

 the body is rounded, the anterior diagonally truncated, and hollowed 

 into a depression whose deepest part is nearer the ventral side. 



The most exterior part of the body is represented by a colorless 

 periplast, of a cellulose nature, in the substance of which extremely 

 fine granulations are dispersed, whose significance, as we shall later 

 see, is that of trichocysts. Inside the colorless investing layer are 

 the chromatophores, olive-green as a rule, in the form of two curved 

 laminae which are applied to nearly the whole inner face of the 

 external layer, and joining each other by their respective borders 

 with such precision that one might think of one chromatophore 

 instead of two. They are, however, not very distinct, except on 

 their right and left sides, on account of their being seen there through 

 a greater thickness. The green laminae are paralleled on their 

 internal face by a continuous sheet of grains of starch, sometimes 

 so much pressed against each other as to deform into hexagona 

 facets, but always making only a single layer. These starch grains 

 must be regarded as a direct product of the chromatophores, and 

 at the same time as a food-reserve, for they disappear in twenty- 

 four hours with unfavorable conditions of life. Besides these amy- 

 laceous grains, others of quite another nature are found; large shining 

 bodies, very generally two in number (sometimes one and rarely three) 

 showing indistinct crystalline forms which might apparently be 

 referred to the hexagonal system; they are always found in the 

 same position, not far from the dorsal side, and just dorsal to the 

 characteristic "cage" that will be spoken of later. These special 

 bodies, which might be compared to the oxalate crystals of Rhizo- 

 pods and Infusoria, are nearly always present, an interesting fact 




146 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [PART I 



to note, in comparison with Cryptomonas curvata where they never 

 exist. Very near the anterior extremity, and under the dorsal 

 prominence, is a very distinct contractile vacuole, which collapses 

 about every half minute, slowly to fill up again. The nucleus, 

 lying in the posterior region, is round, very large, very clear, and 

 has a small central caryosom. Around the nucleus is clear, pure 

 protoplasm, in which are dispersed shining globules of an extremely 

 small size, whose appearance is that of leucosine. The two flagella 

 are seen to start from the base of that beak-like prolongation that 

 terminates the dorsal side of the body, but they arise nearer the 

 ventral than the dorsal side, that is to say, on the ventral wall of 

 that deep cavity which has been erroneously called the pharynx. 

 When the little organism is swimming, nothing can be seen of the 

 flagella; at rest, one of them is generally seen rolled into a wide curve, 

 on the ventral side of the body the other extending backward, on 

 the dorsal side. In one single instance, and in a very much com- 

 pressed individual, whose body was spread into a broad layer, I 

 was able to detect a very small basal granule. The pharynx is a 

 deep, tubular or, more exactly, fusiform fossa, which plunges into 

 the body down to the middle of its length, and even sometimes 

 lower. At its lower end, this cavity is conical; near the upper end it 

 narrows to a tube, then again somewhat expands, and opens funnel- 

 like to the exterior. It is now seen to be carpeted, all along its 

 inner wall, by a continuous sheet of clear granules, in one single 

 layer and in perfect setting, disposed in such a manner that the eye 

 can divide the surface either in longitudinal or in diagonal parallel 

 lines, in two series crossing each other (somewhat like the appear- 

 ance of the shell in Arcella or, better, Cyphoderia. 16 In reality, 

 these small granules or pearls are disposed along diagonal lines 

 going from left to right and from above below, and constitute a 

 kind of "cage" whose lower end reaches far down into the pit, and 

 whose anterior end suddenly terminates in a broad truncature. 

 The number of the diagonal rows may be counted (in big specimens 

 at least) as sixteen, and each row comprises about the same number 

 of pearls also, so that we arrive to a total number of 256 pearls. 

 The cage, however, if my observations are right, is not absolutely 

 continuous; it seems to be split on one of its sides, the dorsal one, 

 and from end to end, one of the borders of the longitudinal fissure 

 being somewhat incurved; the whole cage, in fact, might be com- 

 pared to an enrolled leaf, whose edges do not completely join. The 

 layer of pearls, as we said before, carpets the inside of the pit, but 

 the actual form of the pit is not easy to determine; it is neither a 

 tube nor a fusiform cavity. Could we suppose, for instance, liquid 

 plaster to be cast into the fossa and then removed in the hardened 



16 Belar (4) gives these grains, in Chilomonas paramaecium, as forming 8 

 longitudinal rows, with 10-16 grains for each row. In Cryptomonas ovata, 

 which differs from Chilomonas only in the possession of chromatophores, the 

 grains are more numerous, and the rows also. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 147 



state, it would perhaps give a figure somewhat in the shape of a 

 very thick spoon without a handle. 



In regard to the significance of this tessellated cage, B61ar (4), 

 in his chapter devoted to Chilomonas paramaecium, has studied 

 the subject somewhat at length, and says: "I should not, as Nagler 

 does, consider these granules as supporting elements (stutzende 

 Gebilde), but rather apply that term to the fibrillae on which they 

 are set, and whose existence, if not clearly proved, may be inferred 

 from the regular arrangement of the granules, and which in face-view 

 could occasionally be seen indicated in Iron-Hematoxiline prepara- 

 tions. . . . Rather must these granules be considered as rudi- 

 ments of the jelly-trichocysts (Schleimtrichocysten) of the Crypto- 

 monads. . . . Kunstler's and Ulehla's statement, that, after the 

 crushing of the animalcule, threads come out of the pharynx, which 

 had not been there before, I can confirm myself, a fact, however, 

 which can but very rarely be observed." 



My own observations are also such as to confirm the existence 

 of the ejected threads, I have seen them on three different occasions 

 twice in the living animalcule and once after the action of sublimate, 

 but they are so very thin, so difficult to observe, that I did not, 

 at the time, consider my observations as sure, and I should hardly 

 dare to mention their existence, if my sketches, which date from a 

 time when neither the works of Belar nor those of Kiinstler or Ulehla 

 were known to me, were not in accordance with those of the Austrian 

 observer. 



After these considerations upon these special granules, Belar passes 

 to a somewhat different subject, which we must also treat of here: 

 "We might speak now of the superficial "trichocysts" of our Flagel- 

 late. Butschli was the first to observe them, after him they were 

 described by several authors, lastly by Alexieeff; Dangeard and 

 Nagler do not mention them. They appear as more or less rigid, 

 fine threads from 10 to Z0[l in length, which cover the whole surface 

 of the body. They were mostly found after treatment of the ani- 

 malcules with acetic acid. I have examined living individuals, as 

 well as others treated by acetic and other acids, but without suc- 

 ceeding, either with the simple microscope or by dark -ground il- 

 lumination, in finding anything of the sort. Only after fixation 

 with osmic acid and coloration by Lofner's method for flagella, could 

 I distinguish these elements, but then they were found in every one 

 of the individuals. They do not color intensely, but are sufficiently 

 visible. Each of the animalcules seems to be surrounded by an 




148 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART 1 



assemblage of fine supple threads. These threads have received 

 many explanations. Blitschli considered them as trichocysts, ho- 

 mologous to those of the Ciliata; Kunstler as dead pseudopodia; 

 Lanessan as cilia, which are rendered invisible by interposition of 

 mucilage. In my opinion the first of these explanations has the 

 more probability. These thread-like elements, indeed, are only 

 found on dead animals, for if present in life they would not escape 

 observation, owing to the obstacle they would profer to locomotion. 

 We must then look for corpuscles in the body, which would explain 

 the threads themselves. And indeed, in Iron-hematoxyiin prepa- 

 rations siderophile granules are to be found in a moderate number, 

 close under the pellicula, which might eventually be considered as 

 trichocysts not yet exploded. As for an homology with the tricho- 

 cysts of Ciliata there can naturally be none. The whole question, 

 especially that of the significance of these elements, needs further 

 study." 



I have not been able to detect the presence of these special fila- 

 ments, yet must confirm the presence of the siderophile granules 

 of which Belar speaks, and with which we shall soon have to deal 

 more at length. Before going, however, into that particular sub- 

 ject, I must now consider for a time the second form I spoke of, 

 and which was found at .Florissant, Ehrenberg's Cryptomonas cur- 

 vata. The diagnosis, as given by this author, is the following: 

 "Monad with a curved carapace, with a very much compressed 

 body, large, twice as long as broad, 2V millimeter in length, anteriorly 

 and posteriorly curved somewhat in the form of the letter S; color 

 green." 



In short, the diagnosis is here nearly exactly the same as that of 

 Cryptomonas ovata; the only difference is in the slight $-curve, and 

 one can easily understand the two forms having been united into 

 one, so much the more since Cr. ovata, with its special characters 

 not found in Cr. curvata, is also sometimes in the form of an S. But 

 there are, really, differentiating characters which we must now 

 examine. The anterior curvature (towards the ventral side), and 

 the posterior (towards the dorsal side) are not of great importance, 

 yet it must be observed that the curvature was present in all the 

 specimens at Florissant, though it was exceptional in the other 

 localities. The ectoplasmic colorless pellicle was thicker, and the 

 small globular bodies (siderophile granules) were more numerous, 

 more distinct also, the chromatophores, curved behind, were more 

 distinctly separated from each other. But there are two more 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 149 



distinguishing characters, of much greater importance: the layer 

 of starch grains which lies upon the inner surface of the chromato- 

 phores in Crypiomonas ovata was quite absent in Cr. curvata, and 

 the same relations obtained in the case of the two big crystalloid 

 bodies, which never are present in these species ; besides, a curious 

 fact was seen in curvata: if from the bases of the flagella their line 

 of direction was followed downwards, as far as the middle of the 

 pharyngeal pit, one invariably found there a special granule, very 

 distinct after compression of the animalcule, of a pale bluish hue, 

 and which immediately reddened with borax -carmine, a kineto- 

 nucleus, very probably, which could not be detected in Cr. ovata. 



After these considerations of a systematic nature, I come now 

 back to phenomena which proved common to both species, and 

 which, indeed, were the only inducement to my observing Crypto- 

 monas at some length: I mean those sudden leaps or jumps, which 

 have long been known in the genus, and those explanation has 

 never been given, or at any rate has not been proved. 



From time to time, without any apparent reason or on account 

 of some discernible danger, the animalcule suddenly leaps back- 

 ward, in an amazing jump, five, ten, twenty times its own length, 

 describing an arc or even a nearly complete circle, and always to- 

 ward the same side, its ventral or concave side facing towards the 

 center of the described arc. When danger grows extreme, and the 

 irritation is at its greatest, the jumps succeed each other without 

 intermission for a few seconds, and at last the little Flagellate falls 

 down exhausted, or sometimes bursts altogether, as if some inside 

 rupture of equilibrium has been produced, which dislocates its 

 different constituents, leaving the animalcule as a shapeless body, 

 with nucleus, starch grains, chromatophores, etc., scattered here 

 and there. 



Where are we to find the cause of these sudden jerks, the organ 

 that might produce them? The flagella are out of the question; 

 they are too weak, and besides, those individuals that happen to 

 be deprived of flagella jump just as well as the others. Ehrenberg 

 looks for the explanation in a contraction of the " lateral trunk" 

 the beak -like prolongation, if indeed such is the meaning of the only 

 line he devotes to the subject: "Das rasche Anstossen des seitlichen 

 Riissels veranlasste offenbar das Hupfen." But neither beak nor 

 trunk are in the least degree susceptible of any displacement, An- 

 other explanation has been proposed, to which Pascher ("Suss- 




150 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [PART I 



wasserflora," p. 5) refers: "In some particular groups (Crypto- 

 monadinae), springing movements are effected by sudden contrac 

 tions." 



This explanation, which seems to be commonly accepted today, 

 but without anybody trying to prove the fact, has in my opinion 

 hardly any probability. If we take a frog, for instance, and cut 

 its four legs quite close to the body, how can we imagine it to make 

 sudden leaps two and three yards distant, by means of a contraction 

 of its body? Our Cryptomonas, after all, very much resembles a 

 frog, and even supposing its whole body to be contractile, ft would 

 be difficult to explain in this way even a mere trifling displacement. 

 Such general contractility in Cryptomonas is, besides, nothing but 

 a supposition, I don't think any observer ever noticed any contrac- 

 tions, and for my part, I could find no sign of contractility at all. 

 But even supposing the contractility to exist, the solution of the 

 question would not be much advanced, I happened on several occa- 

 sions to see the animalcule leaping, for one or two seconds at least, 

 when (under the influence of a current of glycerine) the ectoplasmic 

 layers of the body were already crumpled, inert and dead. Crypto- 

 monas, in fact, jumps after death. 



In short, the contraction theory remains a mere supposition, 

 and I may feel entitled to propose another explanation, which, if 

 not necessarily certain, seems based at least on real phenomena. 

 But before developing the subject, I must state a fact, which does 

 not seem to have been mentioned yet: beside these long leaps 

 backward, other leaps may be seen to occur, even much more fre- 

 quent, but of much less importance; the body becomes displaced 

 to right or left, forward or backward, by very slight quiverings, 

 and the same appearance is noticed as in Infusoria while they are 

 discharging their trichocysts. Now we have seen that according 

 to the researches of Belar and others, the very tiny granules that 

 are found in the periplast of Cryptomonas may be considered as 

 trichocysts ; in fact, one might compare them also to the "slime 

 trichocysts" which we shall later on speak of in Trentonia flagellata; 

 and it can hardly be doubted, I think, that the slight quiverings in 

 Cryptomonas are due to superficial trichocysts also. 



My supposition, then, could be formulated in the following words : 

 the sudden jumps backward are due to the explosion of big tricho- 

 cysts, and these are represented by the granules which line the 

 pharyngeal cavity. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 151 



There are, of course, several objections against this statement. 

 For instance, after jumping, the animalcule seems not to have 

 suffered any change in the state of the pharyngeal "cage." But 

 that objection is not strong, in fact is perhaps in favor of the 

 theory. After one jump, even two or three, the "cage" looks 

 complete, but it would be practically impossible to detect the 

 loss of one or two granules, and one of them, indeed, on account 

 of its large size compared to one of the small superficial trichocysts, 

 would suffice to cause a leap, its sudden transformation into a con- 

 siderable mass of some light matter (fine granules, liquid material, 

 slime, or gas?), which would find its way out through the nar- 

 rowed aperture of the fossa, would certainly cause a violent reaction 

 backward. But though after two or three of these leaps the pharyn- 

 geal cage is still intact, it appears, indeed, very different when fre- 

 quent and violent leaps have rapidly succeeded one another; the cage, 

 then, is seen to be disrupted, the granules, much diminished in 

 number, are scattered in a shapeless mass; sometimes a very few 

 persist, perhaps immature ones, which did not explode. Sometimes, 

 when the animalcule is subjected to the greatest possible excitation, 

 as when a chemical reagent, for instance, comes into play, the jumps 

 rapidly succeed one another without intermission, then the body 

 collapses, bursts, and in the remaining (more or less homogeneous) 

 mass, no trace of the cage is left; as if the granules, not finding a 

 sufficiently wide way of egress, had all exploded inside the body. 



A second fact seems to argue for the same theory : the line of 

 the leap, the figure described in space by the displacement of the 

 body. It is always, as we said, an arc, or a circle when the com- 

 motion is particularly violent, and always â€” if I observed well â€” 

 with the same orientation. Now the pharyngeal pit is narrowed 

 in its anterior part into a tubular passage, somewhat curved towards 

 the ventral side, and on the supposition of a sudden emission of 

 matter through this aperture, the backward jumping must describe 

 a circular figure with the concave side of the body facing towards 

 the center. The very form of Cryptomonas might be supposed to 

 necessitate that particular direction, but, as we saw before, Crypto- 

 monas may present the most different forms, the smaller individuals 

 being even oval in shape, and yet the jumps never show any differ- 

 ence at all. 



But I must now point to a fact, which though appearing at first 

 not to be related to this subject, might on the contrary prove of 

 the greatest importance. At the end of January, 1917, in my col- 




152 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART 1 



lections from Rouelbeau, most of the specimens were found in the 

 state of rest, enclosed in a thick gelatinous envelope, just like a 

 larva in its cocoon. 16 Now, as often as I managed to cause a slight 

 current of carmine-glycerine to come into contact with the cocoon, 

 I could see the animalcules, violently distressed and yet unable to 

 jump, revolve on their longitudinal axis, like a top, and at an extra- 

 ordinary rate, perhaps twenty turns in a second , the whirling lasted 

 for two or three seconds, and the animalcule collapsed â€” dead. 



The only explanation of these phenomena seems to be, that the 

 animalcule must have been submitted to a violent whirling current, 

 in a circular or spiral direction, and the current could only take 

 its origin from the inside of the cocoon itself, from the discharge, 

 in fact, of some matter which only the animalcule itself could have 

 produced. Now the direction of the tubular opening in Crypto- 

 monas is such, that on the supposition of ejected material, there 

 must have been produced the exact whirling current whose effect 

 we have noticed. 



As for the composition of the ejected matter, we remain in com- 

 plete uncertainty. We shall see later on, that in Trentonia flagellata 

 the spherules which fill the ectoplasm explode in a finely granu- 

 lar mucilaginous material, easily demonstrated as a white little 

 cloud by using India ink. In Cryptomonas, the same result might 

 have been expected, but some experiments with this method have 

 proved fruitless. I distinctly detected, in some particular cases, 

 displacements in the dark mass of infinitely small black grains, 

 and which were certainly not due to oscillations of the flagella (which 

 give quite a different appearance), but no white cloud was formed. 

 The granules did not resolve in these cases into mucilage, but per- 

 haps into very fine granules, mingled with liquid substance, whose 

 effect in India ink would hardly be conspicuous. 



Astasia mobilis (Rehberg) Alexieeff. Plate VIII, figures 58-61. 



Under the name Astasia mobilis, Alexieeff (1) described in 1912 

 a Flagellate belonging to the group of the Euglenina, and which 

 he had found in the intestine of a Cyclops. That Flagellate, how- 

 ever, had already been described by Rehberg in 1880, as Lagenella 

 mobilis, but a genus Lagenella had been created in 1850 by Schmarda 

 for another organism, and the name had to be abandoned here. 



16 Some of the animalcules, inside the gelatinous pellet, were seen to divide 

 longitudinally; but my observations on the subject are very few, and though 

 confirming in the main those of Belar on the same subject, would not add any 

 phenomena of importance. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 153 



Alexieeff, besides, pointed out that Astasia (Lagenella) mobilis is 

 very nearly related to de Beauchamp's (2) Astasia captiva, found 

 in a Rhabdocoele, Catenula lemnae, and perhaps might even be the 

 same. 



I have met at different times, in the intestine of several species 

 of Cyclops â€” prasinus and others much bigger and which were not 

 identified â€” an Astasia which easily corresponds to the two forms, 

 mobilis and captiva, at least in its general characters, but was 

 mostly of a much larger size. Alexieeff, and de Beauchamp both 

 speak of 30-40[i, Rehberg indicates 102-103[a, but in the form I 

 studied, while the very young individuals which we shall soon speak 

 of were within these limits of size, normal adult or old ones, very 

 likely much enlarged by accumulation of food, reached a much great- 

 er size, some, which in the spherical state generally shown when 

 first isolated from the host, reached as much as 88[i in diameter, 

 and after a moment, in their full state of elongation, developed to 

 a length of 300^. 



Let us now examine one of these large individuals (Plate VIII, 

 fig. 58): 



As in all the other species of the group, the organism continually 

 changes in form, its progression being effected by means of swellings 

 and undulations passing from behind forwards. "The metabolic 

 movement," says de Beauchamp, "is perfectly regular; the flow 

 moving from behind forwards, like a large drop which glides along 

 a wire, and there is nearly always a single wave, the posterior end 

 hardly beginning to enlarge by the time the drop reaches the an- 

 terior end." These swellings are sometimes so broad, in compari- 

 son with the narrow interspaces, that the appearance of the animal- 

 cule becomes most singular, like that, for instance, of a tee-totum. 

 The limiting periplast is colorless, thin, but very tough; striated 

 all over with very fine and regular diagonal lines, about Y^- distant 

 from each other. The body is nearly always entirely filled with 

 grains of paramylum, in the shape of rectangles, but rounded at 

 the ends, 3, 4, and up to 8[i in length, greenish-opalescent when 

 examined singly; but when seen as a general mass they have a black- 

 ish appearance. These grains represent undoubtedly nutritive re- 

 serves, and diminish in size the longer the animalcule fasts. At 

 the posterior extremity, these grains suddenly turn much smaller. 

 In the plasma are also found a considerable number of tiny, shining 

 granulations, colorless, ljx in diameter. The nucleus (Plate VIII, 

 figs. 58, 61), lying about in the middle of the body, is spherical, 

 and entirely filled with extremely small granules, which are of 

 variable size according to the individuals. When after compression 

 the very tough nuclear membrane is suddenly rent, there is seen 

 flowing out a large clear area of plasma in which all these tiny gran- 




154 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP ]PART I 



ules are dispersed. These instantly become red when treated with 

 carmine stain. The contractile vacuole is often encircled by a crown 

 of smaller vesicles, which after the systole will fill up the vacuole 

 again. It is at the anterior part of he body, and empties into a large 

 reservoir, which we must consider a little more at length. The fore- 

 part of the body terminates in a slight prominence, a very small point, 

 which itself borders the entranceof a very narrow tubular opening, this 

 tube then plunges straight down, to open into a vast pouch or reser- 

 voir. But, f romthe bottom of the reservoir, or rather a little higher up 

 on one of the sides, are seen arising two very short threads, one of which, 

 the longer, is directed upwards in a diagonal course and reaches 

 up to near the top of the reservoir, whilst the other, much shorter, 

 hardly reaches the middle. 17 These two filaments, which must be 

 considered as two flagella that never extend any higher, each have 

 a basal granule, and the two granules, very near each other, some- 

 times appear enclosed in a common layer of very pure, bluish plasma. 

 This narrow bluish spot, however, is so indistinct that, doubting 

 its reality, I should not have mentioned it here, if de Beauchamp, 

 with whose observations I only became acquainted long after my 

 own were made, had not said that after the action of reagents he 

 found a small crescent-like black spot upon the wall of the principal 

 vacuole. 18 



Such is the structure of the body in these big specimens of Astasia. 

 But it may be added, that very large individuals, 80[jl in diameter 

 when in the spherical state, and 300[x when in full activity, are of 

 exceptional occurrence; they are mostly so large when only one in- 

 dividual inhabits the intestine of the Cyclops; more generally there 

 are two, four, eight or more individuals, in which cases they are smaller, 

 and it must be considered as probable that they all came from one 

 specimen, which divided and redivided inside the host. They are, in 

 fact, commonly of the same size in the same Cyclops and, if we have in 

 mind the extraordinary differences that are noticed between the 

 individuals one happens to meet with outside the hosts, we cannot but 

 recognize in this special uniformity in size the result of origin from 

 the same parent organism. 



17 The existence of rudimentary flagella does not seem to have been observed. 

 Alexieeff simply says of his Astasia that it presents a flagellum or has none; 

 and de Beauchamp that "sometimes a flagellum is present, but in most cases 

 it is impossible to find any trace of one." Neither of these authors, however, 

 has seen anything inside the reservoir, and de Beauchamp speaks of the flagellum 

 as taking its origin â€” when present at all â€” from the entrance to the buccal tube. 



18 It is not impossible that Pascher considered de Beauchamp's black spot 

 as a rudimentary stigma, for in the diagnosis of that species he says: "Stigma 

 rudimentary, on .the principal vacuole." But de Beauchamp certainly did not 

 see it in this light, as he expressly declares he did not find any trace of a stigma. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 155 



Division is very frequent, and it seems curious that neither Alexi- 

 eeff nor de Beau champ were able to observe it; de Beau champ states 

 that when outside their host, the animals died in a few hours. 

 Moroff (25) , successfully cultivated his Euglena quartana, very nearly 

 related to Astasia, in an organic medium (pea-soup, etc.), and declares 

 that they thrive in purely inorganic cultures, but that after a very 

 little while they perish. 



For my part, I did not find any difficulty in keeping these organ- 

 isms in very good health for three to five and even six days, after 

 isolation in a drop of clear water on an excavated slide and under 

 protection of a cover. 



After creeping for a few hours, one of these big specimens con- 

 tracts into a perfect spherule, and there lies unchanged, for a vari- 

 able time, a whole day for instance; but if after having abandoned 

 the animalcule in the evening we examine our slide early next morn- 

 ing, we find then not one spherule but two, sometimes already four, 

 at 10 o'clock in the morning, those four are dividing again, con- 

 stricted in the middle, at 12 o'clock, eight spherules are present, 

 at 6 o'clock, sixteen are to be seen. On the following morning, the 

 number will be 64, and finally in the evening, after the 8th division, 

 one may count (approximately) as many as 256 small Astasia, 

 some contracted, some elongated and lanceolate, many of them 

 creeping or swimming round a lump of mucilaginous material where 

 most of the individuals are still imbedded. Eight divisions have 

 then successively taken place, after which the primitive single indi- 

 vidual has been turned into 256 little Flagellates. This number, 

 it must be said, must be considered as a maximum, which I never 

 saw exceeded, but have observed to be reached four times in my 

 eight experiments. At other times, however, long before attaining 

 that number the young animalcules begin to detach from the com- 

 mon mass; we should also note that this mass itself is not always 

 homogeneous, but may be very irregular in appearance. It is not 

 a cyst, in fact, just as the little spherules in the mass are not spores; 

 the jelly is more a fugitive secretion, which is easily destroyed, 

 and perhaps it is only on account of the absolute quiescence after 

 isolation on the excavated slide that the common mass remains 

 compact to the end. But, if we take the mass of jelly and carefully 

 compress it under the cover, these little spherules, born from di- 

 vision and destined to divide again, immediately begin to lengthen, 

 creep about, and change their form, just like adults, and this may be 




156 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART I 



made to occur at any of the phases of division, the second, third, 

 fourth, etc. 



The animalcules of the same generation are all alike, and of the 

 same size but after the third (or fourth?) division, they differ from 

 those which came from the first and second (perhaps also the third) 

 division in an important regard : they have, or they may have, a 

 flageJlum. 



In one of these small Flagellates, such as was born from the eighth 

 division (Plate VIII, fig. 61), the vermiform body is very clear and 

 still full of paramylum grains, but these are now very small; just 

 at the posterior extremity two or three larger globules are seen 

 (excretion granules), colorless and highly refractive. The hind- 

 part of the body is itself pointed, sometimes drawn out into a glutin- 

 ous thread-like tail. The nucleus is central, with the character- 

 istic granulations. The contractile vesicle and reservoir are quite 

 as we have already described, and from the bottom of the reservoir 

 are seen to arise two flagella; but while one of these remains in a 

 rudimentary state, just as it was* in the big individuals, the other 

 projects through the buccal tube to the outside, rapidly beating, 

 and trailing the animalcule behind. This flagellum, however, is 

 very slender, and comes off on the least excuse; many of the speci- 

 mens do not have it, either having lost it already or never having 

 possessed it. 



According to Moroff (25), in his diagnosis of Euglena quartana, 

 a very near relative to Astasia, division takes place as follows: 

 "Division after loss of the flagella, either longitudinally into two 

 new individuals, or into four parts after acquiring the globular 

 condition." According to this observer, the second division 19 is 

 at right angles to the first, and seems then to be transverse, the first 

 being longitudinal; but if we keep in mind that all the indications 

 of transverse division in Euglenae have been considered by Klebs 

 and others as very doubtful, we must hesitate in accepting Moroff's 

 statement. It is quite possible that even in the globular condition, 

 after a first division, the two segments insensibly move or displace, 

 and the next division, which is for the observer at right angles to 

 the first, i. e., transverse, is longitudinal in reality. In all circum- 

 stances where I could follow the process in its details, the division 

 proved to be longitudinal; and in some individuals, which though 

 already creeping about were yet in a state of division, one could 



19 Moroff never obtained more than two divisions, that is, four young indi- 

 viduals. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADEPHIA. 157 



foresee that the next division would be longitudinal also, this on 

 account of the nucleus, which begins lengthening at right angles 

 to the longitudinal axis of each of the new individuals, even before 

 the separation of the couole is effected (Plate VIII, fig. 60), and 

 which then will be divided along a line parallel to the line of the 

 next division. 



In these young Flagellates, just beginning to divide, the anterior 

 part of the body broadens, and at the same time hollows into a 

 slight concavity, so as to take the form of a heart; the fissure gets 

 deeper and deeper (Plate VIII, fig. 60), and in proportion as it 

 lengthens downward, the lobes of the heart-shaped body become 

 more and more separated, moving in a respectively right and left 

 direction, with the result that at the moment the fissure reaches 

 the end of the body, the lobes, or new individuals, have each of 

 them turned 90 degrees, and lie with their posterior ends united 

 only by a narrow bridge, the ultimate phase of the division, cutting 

 right through the bridge, will then appear to be transverse, while 

 in reality the division has been longitudinal. But this very narrow 

 bridge, which at last consists only of the very tough periplast sub- 

 stance, is not easy to break, the animalcule, or rather now both, 

 animalcules, struggle right or left, stretch and retract alternately, 

 and above all, twist and turn on their longitudinal axis as they 

 lie tail to tail; one of them, sometimes, is seen to twist to the left 

 while the other twists to the right (in fact each twists toward its 

 own right side), and at last the separating bridge, very thin and 

 contorted to the utmost, breaks and liberates the two young Flagel- 

 lates. The little Astasia is now free, and creeps or swims about 

 with an activity more remarkable than that observed in the adult 

 condition, no difference, however, is to be seen between those very 

 young individuals and the old ones, except, as already said, in the 

 normal possession of a flagellum. 



Speaking of his Euglena quartana, a colorless species also, Moroff 

 (25, p. 102) writes as follows: "I succeeded in obtaining individuals 

 which showed with some distinctness a stigma. At the beginning 

 none of the animals showed any trace of such an organ; but after 

 a few weeks I was able to obtain some, in which the eye was apparent 

 as a very small yellow spot, later on it had acquired an orange hue 

 and looked larger, but later still the eye remained in the same con- 

 dition, without my obtaining any further results." 



Astasia mobilis never shows any stigma, yet I found once, not 

 in a Cyclops but in a watch-glass where some Cyclops had been 




158 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART I 



isolated, an Astasia (or Euglenaf) seeming identical, at first sight, 

 with the habitual parasite, but its paramylum grains were of a 

 more distinctly greenish hue, and besides a small red stigma could 

 be detected distinctly. On another occasion, I got from the in- 

 testine of a Cyclops an Astasia in which two small red eyes existed, 

 one to the right and the other to the left on the anterior part of the 

 body. This specimen, it must be added, was relatively broad and 

 short, and perhaps not far from dividing. 



That these two individuals belonged to Astasia mobilis is not 

 certain. Alexieeff observes that in the Euglena group "transitional 

 forms are found which lead from facultative to definitive para- 

 sitisms." Must Astasia mobilis be considered as a Euglena whose 

 evolution terminated in parasitism, and in which individuals may 

 be found, which retain some ancestral characters? 



Euglena pseudomennis sp. n. Plate VIII, figures 62, 63. 



This elegant little Euglena, which looks at first sight so much like a 

 Nematode that one sometimes mistakes it for one, was found in 

 two different localities, Pinchat and Rouelbeau, in every season of 

 the year but always very rare. 



The form is that of a needle (Plate VIII, fig. 62), 20 very straight, 

 165 to 190[jl in length for only 734 to 8^ in breadth, and it is quite 

 near the anterior part of the body, on a level with the contractile 

 vesicle, that the maximal breadth is found; from this region it di- 

 minishes in width by insensible gradation to the posterior extremity, 

 whose thinness is quite extraordinary. Owing to a slight lateral 

 compression, a transverse section of the needle would give a broadly 

 elliptical figure. Seen along the narrower of the sides, it shows a 

 characteristic swelling (Plate VIII, fig. 62), coinciding with the 

 dilatation of the internal reservoir. The periplast looks shining 

 and smooth, but in reality proves longitudinally striated, but the 

 striae are so delicate and thin that only in very favorable conditions 

 can their reality be ascertained. At the anterior end (Plate VIII, 

 fig. 63), which is somewhat expanded, and in optical section appears 

 to be provided with two tips, the periplast curves and invaginates 

 towards the interior, but for a short distance only, and from this 

 point is continued as a simply plasmatic film which lines the reser- 

 voir. 



This characteristic pouch or reservoir, very long, broad and 

 rounded at the base, becomes narrower towards the top, and at 

 last joins the buccal opening. Into the hind part of the reservoir, 

 and on one of its sides, empties at regular times the contractile 

 vacuole, which is sometimes surrounded by very small accessory 

 vesicles. A short flagellum is seen arising from the buccal funnel, 



20 In the figure, the animalcule is represented too broad relatively to its length. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 159 



a little behind the opening; it looks as if held in place by a basal 

 granule, and at the same time appears to be lengthened posteriorly, 

 like a hardly visible tracing, until it reaches a very distinct swelling 

 about level with the middle of the reservoir. This swelling is caused 

 by the presence, just outside the wall of the reservoir, of a large and 

 very distinct globule, or kinetonucleus. Opposite the kinetonucleus, 

 and on the other side of the reservoir, is the stigma, of a delicate 

 brick-red tint; its form is that of a saucer, and seen from the side 

 looks like a crescent whose convexity is turned towards the reser- 

 voir. Viewed from the dorsal side, it is seen to be a small roundish 

 spot. In the immediate vicinity are sometimes seen very small 

 red particles, which later on will join the principal mass. The in- 

 ternal protoplasm, very clear, and with myriads of extremely fine 

 granules, is in its major portion occupied by a more or less con- 

 siderable number of rod-like elements, which look like chromato- 

 phores, but without color. These are needle-shaped, of a very 

 pure opalescent hue, generally 25 to 30[x in length for only 2 or 3jx 

 in breadth, and often even much thinner, especially those which 

 fill the posterior end of the body. They are set longitudinally, 

 imbricating upon each other, and lie along the whole length of the 

 body. They seem, in fact, to take the place of absent chromato- 

 phores, and if we keep in mind the statements of several observers 

 that green chromatophores are susceptible, under certain influences, 21 

 of being reduced to the state of leucoplasts, it seems that in our 

 Euglena pseudomermis also we are entitled to think of the struc- 

 tures as leucoplasts rather than as paramylum bodies or any other 

 sort of pyrenoid. We might then consider this species as one of 

 those very rare green Flagellates, which have lost their colored 

 constituents, but which still keep the stigma, but only as a vestige 

 of a preceding state. 



Is this species, although deprived of true chromatophores, still 

 absolutely holophytic, or would it to a certain extent take food 

 from the outside in the form of microbes or particles of some other 

 form? I have found in several instances small vegetal particles 

 in the reservoir, and also inside the body protoplasm some small 

 vacuoles have been met with, which contained little granules, like 

 food-vacuoles in fact, but the explanation might be different, and 

 the subject remains still obscure. 



About in the middle of the body is seen the nucleus, whose appear- 

 ance is most peculiar. It is generally found as a spherule, sur- 

 rounded by a clear halo of lighter material, but this nucleus proper 



21 Light would be the more important agent. According to Zumstein (1900) 

 the chromatophores disappear as such in the dark, but persist as leucoplasts, 

 and reform into chloroplasts again if brought back into the light. Euglena 

 pseudomermis was always collected with a small net dipped into the black mud 

 of the bottom of the ditch; it is quite possible that it lives in semi-darkness 

 inside that "organic felt" which is found carpeting the ground. 




160 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART I 



is itself a constituent part of a long, pale, grayish rod-like mass, 

 which stains red with carmine, but much less easily than does the 

 spherical nucleus. Sometimes, there are two of these cylindrical 

 masses, with the nucleus in one of them only, or the cylindrical 

 mass may contain, not one nucleus in its center (as is most gener- 

 ally the case, (Plate VIII, fig. 63), but several, regularly disposed, 

 for instance three at equal distances, or four in two groups which 

 are separated by a longer interval (Plate VIII, fig. 62). 



Euglena pseudomermis slowly progresses forward in a straight 

 line, then suddenly stops, and takes up its course again, slightly 

 shaken by the beating of the flagellum. The little moving needle 

 looks rigid, not deformable, but is not so in fact; from time to time 

 it is seen to curve feebly, or become deformed by longitudinal un- 

 dulations, very weak indeed but adding in a remarkable manner 

 to the resemblance to a small Nematode. 



The only two Euglenae which I could find in literature to have 

 any similarity to Euglena pseudomermis are Eugl. acus Ehrenberg 

 and Eugl. acutissima Lemmermann. But both are relatively much 

 less lengthened, fusiform rather than like real needles; and besides, 

 they have characteristic green chromatophores. I long hesitated 

 as to the genus to which this little Flagellate might belong. Menoi- 

 dium differs from Euglena in the complete absence of chromato- 

 phores. Would it have been better to make a Menoidium of this 

 species? 



Trentonia flagellate Stokes. Plate VIII, figs. 64r-67 a, b. 



In the analytical table which concerns the group of the Chloro- 

 monadinae, as given by Pascher (27, p. 177), the subdivision of the 

 colored forms is into three genera, which are distinguished from 

 each other as follows: 



I. No highly refractive trichocyst-like corpuscles in the peripheral 

 plasma layer. 



A. Cells changeable in form, more or less pyriform, narrower 



at the anterior end. Vacuolaria. 



B. Cells less changeable in form; at the anterior end diagonally 



truncate, long and narrowed posteriorly. Trentonia. 



II. In the peripheral plasma, highly refracting trichocyst-like cor- 

 puscles. Gonyostomum. 



Vacuolaria would then differ from Trentonia only in having a 

 more pronounced change of form, and also by some difference in 

 shape, the narrower part being anterior whilst in Trentonia it is 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 161 



posterior. As far as I could observe, there is no importance in the 

 first of these distinctive characters, the changes of form in Tren- 

 tonia being much greater than is generally thought, and as for the 

 general shape of the body, if Cienkowsky's Vacuolaria virescens 

 proves to be in accordance with the above-mentioned diagnosis, 

 Senn's Vacuolaria viridis, which according to Pascher is intermediary- 

 between Trentonia and Vacuolaria, is in fact like Trentonia being 

 described as inversely pyriform (verkehrt birnformig), rapidly nar- 

 rowed at the tail-like posterior end, strongly broadened and ex- 

 cavated anteriorly. On the same page 177, Pascher adds a note: 

 "We must probably reunite with Vacuolaria Stein's Coelomonas, 

 which differs from the former only in the possession of a single 

 flagellum. The second flagellum, which lies very close to the body, 

 probably escaped Stein's attention." 



As for Gonyostomum, or more especially Diesing's Gonyostomum 

 semen which is synonymous with Ehrenberg's Rhaphidomonas 

 semen, it is nothing but a Trentonia again, but one in which are found, 

 under the periplast, small highly refracting rod-like bodies which 

 at times develop as cilia. Speaking of Rhaphidomonas, S. Kent 

 (20) writes as follows: "Excepting for the presence of numerous and 

 variously distributed trichocysts it closely resembles Coelomonas," 

 and Stokes (34) says of his Trentonia flagellata: "This is very simi- 

 lar to Rhaphidomonas semen (Ehrbg.) Stein, with two flagella and 

 no apparent trichocysts. When first observed it was without hesi- 

 tation identified with the above-mentioned European form." In 

 the classical treatise of Engler & Prantl (12), one reads, page 171, 

 concerning Coelomonas: "Doubtful genus. Like Vacuolaria, but 

 with only one flagellum. Stein has probably missed the second 

 flagellum. . . . The genus Coelomonas Stein must also very 

 likely be abandoned." 



Between all these Flagellates, Vacuolaria viridis, Coelomonas 

 grandis, Trentonia flagellata, and even Goniostomum semen, the 

 differences are so obscure, the general form of the body, the tri- 

 angular reservoir, the chromatophores â€” everything, in fact, is so 

 identical, that it is difficult to fancy anything but one and the 

 same organism; in Coelomonas, the second flagellum, which in Tren- 

 tonia is at the very limit of visibility, might not have been detected ; 

 in Rhapidomonas, the trichocysts have been exaggerated in their 

 appearance. However it may be, it is as Trentonia flagellata Stokes 

 (33), undoubtedly identical with what I have seen myself, that I 

 shall consider the curious Flagellate we now come to speak of. It 




162 PROCEEDINVS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART I 



was found, rather numerous, in two different localities: Pinchat, 

 where I found it in every season of the year, and Rouelbeau, where 

 it was seen on one occasion only. 



The most striking quality of this Flagellate is perhaps found 

 in its special coloration, a beautiful bright green, which invests 

 the whole body, and at once distinguishes it from the many other 

 colored organisms that are swimming about. It is the pure green 

 of chlorophyll, such as is found in the spherical granules of the 

 higher plants, being without admixture of blue or brown. 



The body (Plate VIII, fig. 64), measuring 40, 50, and up to Q0[i 

 and more, is in the form of a fish, two to three times as long as broad, 

 somewhat compressed laterally, broader at the anterior end, nar- 

 rower posteriorly, and often terminating in a point. The form 

 of the whole body is slightly changeable, subject to alteration here 

 or there, becoming now and then contorted or even excavated, 

 but coming after a time to its original shape. The little green 

 organism goes straight on its way, with a single flagellum visible, 

 which is thin and straight, about as long as the body, and which 

 hardly seems to move. From time to time, a sudden advance or 

 leap is noticed, somewhat as in Cryptomonas but to a much shorter 

 distance, and not always backwards but forwards just as well. 

 To get an adequate understanding of the intimate structure of 

 Trentonia, it is necessary to have recourse to compression, gentle, 

 weak enough not to deform the body to more than a moderate de- 

 gree, and yet strong enough to stop its movements (Plate VIII, 

 fig. 65). The result required is, however, easily obtained, as the 

 periplast is absent (or rather represented by a very thin hardened 

 pellicula) and nothing prevents the body expanding. The body, 

 in fact, may be considered as naked, so much so that with a stronger 

 compression the animalcule is seen to transform into the shape of 

 an Amoeba, displaying lobes or even extending into pseudopodia. 

 Inside the very thin surface pellicle is a rather thick layer of very 

 pure ectoplasm, of a peculiar appearance, opalescent and shining, 

 and in it are seen dispersed a number of very small light vesicle, 

 or vacuoles, which seem to be provided with a distinct wall. But 

 in that external opalescent layer other elements are found, tiny 

 spherical granules, very clear and brilliant, which often are seen 

 to protrude over the surface of the pellicula, sometimes even in 

 the shape of short setae. 22 They must probably be considered 

 as trichocysts, the very structures which are represented by Stein 

 in Rhaphidomonas semen as rod-like in form, but in the present 

 species globular. Inside this ectoplasmic layer are the chromato- 



22 In an animalcule that had been much compressed, along its longitudinal 

 axis (Plate VIII, fig. 66), without any addition of a reagent, the whole surface 

 was seen surrounded by very short radial filaments, which must have resulted 

 from tho. exploding of these tiny bodies. 




1921] NATUBAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 163 



phores. They consist entirely of small fusiform bodies, regularly 

 disposed in two or three superimposed layers, with their long axes 

 in a line parallel to the surface of the body. They are very delicate, 

 and when compressed become rounded, showing at the same time 

 a central lighter region. All together, these fusiform corpuscles 

 make up a thick envelope, limiting a large clearer endoplasm, color- 

 less, half-liquid in appearance, which contains the nucleus. This 

 latter, very pale, consists of a homogeneous grayish plasma, with 

 here and there a few very small nucleoles. At the anterior end of 

 this colorless endoplasm, a large triangular space appears, the char- 

 acteristic reservoir, into which from time to time is seen to empty 

 the adjacent contractile vesicle; the reservoir itself communicates 

 with the outside by means of a narrow channel, which opens not 

 quite at the anterior extremity, but somewhat laterally. 



Of the two flagella, only one of them, the locomotor flagellum, 

 can usually be detected. Both, however, have their origin in the 

 small depression where the channel of the reservoir opens, and, 

 so far as I could observe, start from the same spot, a little 

 within the opening and on the ventral side of the tube. Stokes 

 describes the locomotor flagellum as "apparently originating in the 

 oval fossa; the other taking its origin on the ventral or lower sur- 

 face a short distance behind the anterior extremity, and usually 

 trailing, but I should not be surprised if there was a mistake in 

 this statement. Further on the American observer continues: 

 "The trailing flagellum is ordinarily extremely difficult to see. 

 When the Infusorian is rendered uncomfortable and sluggish by 

 prolonged confinement beneath the cover, or partially poisoned by 

 iodine, then the vibratile flagellum, which is usually held stiffly 

 in advance, the tip alone trembling, is flashed into sight as a rapidly 

 undulating spiral, and the trailing appendage is also momentarily 

 directed forward. . . . It is scarcely possible to believe that 

 Stein would have failed to notice so important an appendage." 

 My own observations entirely confirm Stokes's statements; but as 

 for a mistake by Stein, I regard it indeed as quite possible. The 

 trailing flagellum is so extraordinarily thin, and its refracting 

 properties are so much like that of water, that it is only detected 

 with the utmost difficulty. I studied Trentonia for many days 

 without noticing any second flagellum, which, however, was there; 

 afterwards, I was able to see it on many occasions. Some of my 

 observations seem to prove that when the animalcule is at rest, 

 the accessory flagellum lies stretched behind, and adheres with its 

 tip to the substratum, keeping the body in place.

When describing the thick layer of opalescent ectoplasm which 

 surrounds the body, I mentioned but two kinds of included ele- 

 ments, the tiny trichocysts and the small round vesicles; but we 

 must now consider a new sort of inclusions. They are spherules, 

 2(x in diameter, of a very pale and pure bluish hue, and though 

 extremely numerous, generally escape any notice, or rather are 

 ascertained only after compression of the body; and the greater 

 the compression the more numerous they are seen to be, they are 

 in such numbers, in fact, that they seem to make up the whole of 

 the plasma. 



Singly examined (Plate VIII, fig. 67a), they are seen to possess 

 a distinct membrane, very thin and smooth but suddenly, after a 

 few seconds of observation, the membrane happens' to burst, and 

 through the opening expands a voluminous mass of mucilaginous 

 material, mingled with a number of extraordinarily fine dust-like 

 particles (Plate VIII, fig. 67). These globules, in fact, must be 

 considered as quite a special form of trichocysts, the "Schleim- 

 trichocysten" of German authors. But during all the time that 

 the gradual compression of the animalcule is continued, there are 

 seen to take place inside the compressed plasma small commo- 

 tions, sudden disturbances of equilibrium, explanation of which 

 is difficult to determine; but if India ink is used, the most external 

 of the spherules, which are easily examined singly, are seen to eject 

 a little white cloud when bursting, at the same time that a slight 

 commotion is noticed in the adjacent lining ectoplasm; all these 

 successive commotions that we saw occurring inside the animalcule 

 must then also have their cause in exploding internal trichocysts. 



India ink experiments enable us to observe still more curious 

 phenomena: if the black current is made to touch an animalcule 

 which is in perfect health, and is moving freely under the cover 

 glass, the organism is seen to throw out here and there, now back- 

 wards, now forwards, or on one side, these same wh te little clouds 

 which we observed before, and at each of these characteristic ex- 

 plosions, the animalcule leaps backward or forward or to one side. 

 It is, indeed, a very interesting thing to follow one of these little 

 animals while swimming at full speed, discharging without inter- 

 mission its projectiles, like a man-of-war that would bombard the

enemy. To these successive explosions we must attribute the char- 

 acteristic leaps in Trentoniaâ„¢ 



I must mention, before concluding, the existence of gelatinous 

 cysts, which I found numerous at Pinchat, in the month of May. 

 They are very similar to those of Cryptomonas ovata, and contain 

 either one single individual, or very often two, longitudinally applied 

 to each other, undoubtedly a result of division. Sometimes, in- 

 stead of two individuals, four are found, or two couples, one to the 

 right and the other to the left inside the gelatinous cyst, which 

 would certainly indicate a second division.

DESILICATED GRANITIC PEGMATITES 1 . 

 BY SAMUEL G. GORDON. 



The granitic pegmatites are among the most interesting mineral 

 assemblages known to the mineralogist, containing as they frequent- 

 ly do so many rare minerals. The present paper describes an ab- 

 normal group of granitic pegmatites, composed either of plagioclase, 

 usually albite, alone (albitite); of plagioclase and corundum (plu- 

 masite); or largely of corundum; all of which occur exclusively in 

 peridotites or their altered equivalents. The conclusion has been 

 reached that they owe their peculiarities to the reactions which oc- 

 curred between the original pegmatitic solutions and the peridotite 

 or serpentine into which these solutions were intruded. Such an 

 origin has been demonstrated for the plumasite of South Africa by 

 Du Toit 2 ; a study of the albitites of Pennsylvania and Mary- 

 land indicates a similar genetic history ; and the corundum deposits 

 of Pelham and Chester, Massachusetts, of western North Carolina, 

 and of Georgia present analogies which show them to belong in this 

 group. 



Previous Work. 

 Albitite. 



California : The name albitite was given by Turner 3 in 1896 to 

 an albite rock occuring as dikes in serpentine in the Grizzly Hill area, 

 about Meadow Valley, and near Big Bar Hill, Plumas County, 

 California. The albitite dikes were composed of large grains of 

 albite with marked cleavage, and showing occasionally a twin 

 lamella. 



Previous to this, Palache 4 had described a soda amphibole (cros- 



1 The writer is indebted to Dr. Edgar T. Wherry and Dr. N. L. Bowen for a 

 critical examination of this paper. The Pennsylvania and Maryland albitite 

 were studied during the summer of 1920. An account of the minerals of the 

 district will appear shortly in The American Mineralogist, and a description of 

 the chromite deposits in a later paper in the Proceedings of this Academy.

site) from a large boulder of white saccharoidal albite which was 

 found in the bed of a stream at the foot of the Sierras near Berkeley. 

 The boulder contained also veins of actinolite. 



France: In 1900, Lacroix noted the occurrence of albitite dikes 

 in the peridotites of Bellongue (Ariege), France, consisting essenti- 

 ally of albite-oligoclase. 6 



Ural Mountains: Duparc and Pamfil have described albitite 

 from Koswinsky, in the northern Ural Mountains, where it forms 

 aplitic dikes in dunite. 6 As in the case of the California and French 

 occurrences no data was given as to the relation of the albitite to 

 the country rock, beyond the fact that it formed intrusives in ser- 

 pentine or peridotite. 



The Russian albitite is associated with a series of related rocks 

 which have been named granulite, gladkaite and plagiaplite. 



The granulite is a rock composed essentially of quartz, andesine, 

 and biotite, forming veins in the dunite of Koswinsky. 



Gladkaite is a fine grained aplite composed of oligoclase and an- 

 desine, with much quartz, some hornblende and biotite, and secon- 

 dary muscovite and epidote. It forms dikes in the dunite at Glad- 

 kai Sopka, and Kamenouchky.* 



Plagiaplite is an equigranular aplite composed of oligoclase or 

 andesine, with variable amounts of quartz and hornblende, and 

 subordinate muscovite or biotite. This rock forms dikes in the 

 pyroxenites of Koswinsky and Kamenouchky. 



This series may represent granitic pegmatites which differ in the 

 degree of desilication which they have undergone. Analyses of 

 them are given by Duparc and Pamfil. 



The occurrence of albitic dikes in the serpentines of New South 

 Wales was noted by Benson 7 who considered them as being geneti- 

 cally related to the peridotites. 



Plumasite. 



California: The name plumasite was given by Lawson to an 

 oligoclase-corundum rock forming a fifteen foot dike in a serpentin- 

 ized peridotite on the lower flank of Spanish Peak, Bidwell Bar 

 quadrangle, Plumas County, California. 8

The plumasite is a coarse allotriomorphic granular aggregate of 

 white oligoclase (Ab 6 An 2 ) in which are imbedded pale violet blue 

 idiomorphic crystals of corundum. Scaly films of margarite occur 

 in fractures in the corundum. One hundred feet northwest. of 

 the corundiferous portion of the dike, the rock consists of coarse 

 granular plagioclase without corundum, but with occasional nests 

 of a grayish-green fibrous monoclinic amphibole. Twenty-five 

 feet southeast of the corundiferous portion, the dike consists of 

 microcrystalline and porphyritic andesine. An analysis of the oli- 

 goclase is given below. 



Italy: In 1903, Lacroix 9 called attention to the occurrence of 

 plumasite near Mosso Santa Maria, Biella, Italy, from which Gon- 

 nard 10 had described corundum crystals. An analysis of the oligo- 

 clase is given below. 



New Caledonia: Subsequently, Romeu 11 noted the occurrence 

 of plumasite in New Caledonia. 



Transvaal: The Transvaal corundum deposits have been des- 

 cribed by Wagner. 12 South Africa is the leading corundum-pro- 

 ducing country at present, the greater part coming from the Zout- 

 spansberg and Pietersburg districts of the Transvaal. Most of the 

 corundum recovered occurs as alluvial crystals or fragments and 

 boulders. The source of the material was found to be a plumasite 

 composed essentially of andesine, (Ab 5 5An 46 ), greenish biotite 

 and corundum. The corundum occurs in crystals up to 6 inches 

 in length scattered through the plumasite, which, however, may 

 consist wholly of andesine. 



Natal: In 1919, Du Toit 13 described the plumasite of Natal, 

 with details concerning its relation to the country rock, and mode 

 of origin. 



The Natal plumasite forms dikes in the serpentine bodies of the 

 Tugela Valley. The area is underlain by hornblende-schists, 

 granulites, and basic gneisses, riddled with dikes and veins of peg- 

 matite and aplite. In this complex are sills of serpentine., a light 

 gray to dark green fine grained rock composed almost entirely of 

 antigorite, with occasional plates of talc and black particles of

magnetite and chromite. Microscopic study indicates that the 

 original rock was a saxonite composed of predominant enstatite or 

 bronzite. 



The plumasite dikes are very irregular in thickness and direction, 

 and are composed of white granular oligoclase on the margins; to- 

 wards the center corundum makes its appearance with silvery white 

 margarite ; in places corundum and margarite may occur to the ex- 

 clusion of the oligoclase. The composition of the plumasite veins 

 varies considerably, in some places being entirely feldspathic, and 

 elsewhere quite rich in corundum. The oligoclase forms granular 

 aggregates, only one third of which exhibits repeated twinning, 

 although the bulk of the remainder possesses a higher index of re- 

 fraction than balsam. The corundum forms dark gray, grayish 

 green or bluish crystals, which are frequently sheathed by a thin 

 shell of primary margarite. At times secondary margarite pene- 

 trates the basal cleavage plates of the corundum, or forms margari- 

 tized individuals with remnants of corundum. 



The most interesting plumasite dike pierced a large sill of serpen- 

 tine flanked below by granulite which was exposed through a ver- 

 tical range of 150 feet. In the granulite the dike was a normal 

 granitic pegmatite composed of quartz, orthoclase, and subordinate 

 plagioclase, with hardly any biotite, and no corundum. In the 

 serpentine above the dike had contracted in width, lost all its 

 quartz, but now carried corundum. 



Du Toit advanced the view that the plumasite owes its genesis 

 to the desilicating action of the serpentine walls upon the originally 

 acid magma constituting the dike. Evidence of reaction between 

 the invading acid magma and its ultrabasic walls is quite evident. 

 Between the plumasite and the serpentine is a contact zone from 

 a few feet to 10 feet in width. Adjacent to the plumasite the zone 

 consists of a belt of brown mica, variable in width, which passes 

 laterally into a proportionally wider belt of massive or foliated 

 talc. The mica is brownish, with weak to moderate pleochroism, 

 and an axial angle of 2Â° to 20Â° or 30Â°, and considered to consist of 

 both biotite and phlogopite. 14 Irregular or lenticular patches of 

 the mica occur as xenoliths in the plumasite. Isolated patches of 

 the talc may occur in the serpentine. In the reaction between 

 the pegmatitic solutions and the serpentine the serpentine received 

 an addition of silica, alumina, potash and fluorine to form the 



14 More probably vermiculite.

zones of biotite and talc, resulting in the impoverishment of these 

 constituents in the dike which crystallized into an aggregate of 

 oligoclase, corundum, and margarite, with occasional tourmaline.

PENNSYLVANIA AND MARYLAND ALBITITES. 



Albitite has long been quarried for feldspar in the serpentine 

 area along the Pennsylvania-Maryland line, which includes south- 

 ern Lancaster and Chester counties, Pennsylvania, and Cecil Coun- 

 ty, Maryland. 



The geology of part of the district has been described by Bas- 

 com/ 6 and the principal quarries by Hopkins' 7 andBastin. 18 



The district is underlain by an igneous complex, to the north of 

 which lies a mica gneiss thoroughly injected by a fine grained gra- 

 nite. The igneous rocks form a batholithic mass, in which the 

 following interesting series is exhibited in passing from the south- 

 east to the northwestern part of the district: biotite granodiorite, 

 hornblende granodiorite, quartz-biotite-hornblende gabbro, quartz- 

 hornblende gabbro, hornblende-norite and quartz-norite, norite, 

 pyroxenite, and peridotite. All are more or less metamorphosed, 

 the granodiorites assuming a gneissic structure, while the perido- 

 tite is usually altered to serpentine. 



The more important albitite dikes are limited to the largest ser- 

 pentine mass which lies along the Pennsylvania-Maryland line

(fig. 1). Small irregular dikes occur also in Brinton's serpentine 

 quarries, three miles south of West Chester (fig. 2). Extensive 

 quarries lie west and northwest of Sylmar in Chester County, and 

 southeast of Rock Springs, and northeast of Pilot, Cecil County. 

 In two cases, east of Bald Friar, and a mile northeast of Pilot, Ce- 

 cil County, quarries have produced commercially both albite and 

 talc. But two quarries are at present worked: Wiant's quarry 

 three-quarters of a mile northeast of Pilot, and Garrison's quarry, 

 three-quarters of a mile east of Rock Springs, Cecil County. The 

 others are abandoned and filled with water, but their size gives 

 evidence of the great quantity of albite which they formerly pro- 

 duced. 



The albitite dikes range in size from a few inches in width, such 

 as at Brinton's quarry, south of West Chester (fig. 2), to great 

 masses four or five hundred feet in length, and more than a hundred 

 feet in width, such as were quarried at the Rock Springs quarry, 

 and at the Sparvetta, Keystone, and Brandywine quarries, one 

 and a half miles west of Sylmar, and at Campbell's quarry, two 

 miles northwest of Sylmar.

As is characteristic of pegmatites in general, the albitite dikes 

 are exceedingly irregular, pinching and swelling, and very frequent- 

 ly bifurcating. Examples of the irregularities are shown in fig. 3 

 and fig. 4. 



The albitites consist almost entirely of granular white, yellowish, 

 or bluish gray, translucent albite. 19 Most of the albite is un- 

 twinned, â€” a peculiarity noted above as being shown by the albite 

 of the California albitite, and in the oligoclase of the Natal pluma- 

 site. A yellowish-white untwinned albite from Campbell's quarry, 

 two miles northwest of Sylmar gave the following indices of refrac- 

 tion upon immersion, indicating a quite pure albite: a = 1.526, 

 Â£=1.530, y= 1.536, all=0.0005 A granular grayish white al- 

 bite from the vicinity of the L^ne Pit (probably from the present 

 site of Garrison's quarry, three-quarters of a mile west of Rock 

 Springs) was analyzed by Brush 20 with the following results:

Quartz is conspicuous by its absence, having been noted at but 

 one locality, a quarry north of Black Run, one and a half miles 

 northwest of Sylmar, where it occurs with much muscovite and 

 anorthoclase (fig. 7) . The most frequent accessory minerals are 

 hornblende and biotite. Hornblende forms minute radiating groups 

 while biotite occurs in minute crystals, scattered through the al- 

 bite, at times occuring locally in large amount. Tourmaline is 

 abundant in the albitite of Brinton's quarry, and molybdenite has 

 been found in the quarries northwest of Sylmar. Actinolite some- 

 times occurs in beautiful greenish radiations through the albite, 

 especially near the margins of the dikes. The albitite of Wiant 's 

 quarry, three-quarters of a mile northeast of Pilot, Cecil County, 

 is filled with miarolitic cavities which are lined with minute, color-

less albite crystals. Minute, transparent, greenish, highly modi- 

 fied beryl crystals occur rarely implanted on the albite, while not 

 infrequently the rest of the cavity is filled with matted masses of 

 dark greenish actinolite needles. Occasionally a peculiar green 

 and white porphyritic rock occurs near the margin of the dikes, 

 especially in the Sylmar district. Examination of thin sections of 

 of this material shows the phenocrysts to be aggregates of zoisite 

 in a groundmass of serpentine, and actinolite needles, (fig. 8). Such 

 an association in which the zoisite was pink in color has been briefly 

 described by Wherry. 21 



Adjacent to the albitite dikes are usually three distinct zones of 

 minerals formed by the reaction of the pegmatitic solutions with 

 the serpentine walls. In passing from the albitite to the serpentine 

 their order is: vermiculite, actinolite with more or less talc, and 

 talc â€” beyond which lies the serpentine (fig. 9). 



The vermiculite zone consists of brown scaly vermiculite, repre- 

 senting a weathered biotite. Analyses of the variety jefferisite 

 from Brinton's quarry, Chester county, are given below. Masses 

 of vermiculite may occur in the albitite. The actinolite zone, 

 which is thinner than others, consists of greenish radiating crystals 

 of actinolite with more or less talc. The talc zone consists of silvery 

 white to light greenish, massive or foliated talc, in which are us- 

 ually disseminated many minute octahedral crystals of magnetite. 



It will be observed that there is a gradual increase of magnesia 

 and water in passing from the albitite to the serpentine. From 

 this it seems probable that the peridotite had been serpentinized 

 prior to the intrusion of the albitite, which had the effect of par- 

 tially dehydrating the serpentine in the vicinity of the intruded 

 mass. In the formation of the biotite (now vermiculite), actinolite, 

 and talc zones, the pegmatitic solutions were more or less depleted 

 of silica, alumina, lime, potash, and fluorine. The potash, fluorine, 

 and alumina went to form the biotite zone, magnesia and perhaps 

 iron being furnished by the serpentine. Most of the silica was used 

 in silicating the serpentine to actinolite and talc, the physico-chemi- 

 cal conditions being such as to cause the formation of hydroxy- 

 silicates. The result was that the original pegmatitic solutions, 

 which under normal circumstances would have crystallized into a 

 rock composed of quartz, microcline, albite or oligoclase, muscovite

PENNSYLVANIA PLUMASITES. 26 



Plumasites or corundum-bearing pegmatites occur in Pennsyl- 

 vania at the following localities: Morgan Station and Black Horse 

 in Delaware County, (fig. 10), and near Union ville, Chester 

 County (fig. 2) . All form intrusive masses in serpentine, or at the 

 contact of serpentine and gneiss. 



The geology of the region has been described by Rogers, 27 Frazer 

 and Hall, 28 Rand, 29 Bascom 30 and others. The area is underlain 

 by Precambrian gneisses and schists into which have been intruded 

 bodies of granite, gabbro, peridotite and pyroxenite. The basal or 

 Baltimore gneiss is a banded quartz-feldspar rock with massive 

 granitic facies. Overlying this is the Wissahickon mica gneiss, a 

 schistose quartz-feldspar rock with an excess of biotite or muscovite. 

 The peridotites and pyroxenites, which are genetically related to 

 the gabbros, in most cases have been hydrated to serpentine. 



Morgan Station (Village Green.) This locality is situated on a 

 very small patch of serpentine intrusive in Wissahickon gneiss one- 

 quarter mile south of Morgan Station, Aston township (fig. 10). 

 Large bronzy brown corundum crystals were found sheathed with 

 white pearly margarite. 31 



Black Horse, Middletown Township. An old corundum mine 

 was formerly situated in a large area of serpentine about one-quarter 

 mile south of Black Horse, on the west side of the road to Elwyn 

 (fig. 10). Many loose crystals of corundum were found in the soil 

 in the vicinity of the pit, and elsewhere in the township. One half 

 mile to the west are exposed granite gneisses. The corundum in 

 slender bipyramidal crystals, of a white to brown color, often as- 

 teriated, 32 was found in a granular white albite-oligoclase. 



26 As it has been stated that corundum was first found in America in Laurens 

 County, S. C, in 1819, it is desirable to point out an earlier discovery of this 

 mineral at Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia: Adam Seybert, Adamantine spar and 

 basaltes, Medical Repository, 3: 202, 1800; also J. C. Delametherie, J. de Phys.

Unionville, Chester County. 33 The Unionville corundum mines, 

 now abandoned, are situated in Newlin township, respectively one 

 and a half and two miles northeast of Unionville (fig. 2), at the con- 

 tact of serpentine and mica gneiss. Many boulders of corundum 

 were obtained in the fields by the farmers who systematically 

 dropped a crow-bar in the soil in the trail of the plow. 



At the pits one and a half miles northeast of Unionville the cor- 

 undum was found in a rock consisting of granular white albite, cor- 

 undum, black tourmaline, margarite, and euphyllite â€” a basic so- 

 dium and potassium mica. The corundum occurred in white or 

 grayish crystals. Zoisite was abundant, and occasionally black 

 octahedra of spinel were obtained. Adjacent to the vein the fol- 

 lowing minerals were noted : talc in white foliated masses and green- 

 ish actinolite with much dark green chlorite. 



At the mine one-half mile north of the preceding one a vein of 

 corundum and margarite seven feet thick was uncovered, which 

 was separated from the serpentine by a zone of foliated talc. In 

 this a vein of fawn-colored diaspore measuring three by two feet in 

 length and width, and two inches in thickness was discovered, some 

 of the crystals of which were two inches long. 34 The corundum 

 was white, brownish gray, to bluish. Crystals not infrequently 

 were sheathed with margarite or damourite. Margarite formed 

 in yellowish or pinkish foliated masses, or secondary aggregates of 

 scales with cores of corundum. Associated with the margarite 

 were honey-yellow or fawn colored laminated masses of diaspore, 

 occasionally in perfect spendent crystals up to two inches in length. 

 Beautiful translucent bluish or greenish prismatic crystals of tour- 

 maline penetrate the diaspore. The association is such as to in- 

 dicate the order of crystallization: tourmaline, diaspore, margarite. 

 Jefferisite (vermiculite) is found in large yellowish green plates. 



The plagioclase at the Unionville mines varies from white albite 

 to yellowish striated oligoclase. Analyses of these are given be- 

 low.

LOCALITIES OF PLUMASITE IN OTHER STATES. 



Pelham, Massachusetts: The occurrence of corundum and 

 its associated minerals at Pelham, Mass. has been described by 

 Emerson. 35 The locality is an asbestos mine, one mile southwest 

 of Mount Lincoln, Pelham township, where a great block of black 

 saxonite is enclosed in Pelham granite gneiss. 



The saxonite is a fine granular dark gray rock composed of color- 

 less enstatite darkened by abundant chromite and magnetite, and 

 containing porphyritic plates of bronzy enstatite. Between the 

 Pelham granite gneiss and the saxonite a thick contact "reaction 

 rim" has been developed. The granite gneiss is a light gray rock 

 consisting of a granular mixture of quartz, microcline, streaked 

 with biotite scales and epidote grains. Near the contact the gra- 

 nite is more massive, less biotitic and quartzose, and grades into 

 a layer of snow-white, fine grained anorthite containing some an- 

 desine crystals, and much disseminated tourmaline, rutile, zircon, 

 and allanite. This layer passes into an interrupted layer of black 

 massive tourmaline in many places two feet thick, at times con- 

 taining some large imperfect crystals of the mineral, with small

crystals of apatite and zoisite. The last zone is composed of 

 coarsely matted reddish-brown biotite from four inches to four feet 

 thick containing many nodules of dark green fibrous actinolite and 

 large nodules and crystals of corundum. Beyond this lies the sax- 

 onite which for a distance of three to twelve feet contains a network 

 of veins of colorless, fibrous anthophyllite, â€” the asbestos for which 

 the pit was worked. 



The tourmaline, rutile, and allanite are characteristic of peg- 

 matitic assemblages, and in this case a pegmatitic facies probably 

 developed at the margin of the Pelham granite gneiss which reacted 

 with the saxonite to form the interesting series of contact minerals. 

 Beyond the contact zones siliceous solutions entered the fractured 

 saxonite and silicated the saxonite minerals to anthophyllite. 



Chester, Massachusetts: The Chester emery deposits have 

 been described by Jackson, 36 Shepard, 37 and Emerson. 38 The 

 Chester emery deposits occur as a series of small disconnected len- 

 ses up to sixteen feet in thickness, but averaging four feet, between 

 the Chester hornblende schist and serpentine. The hornblende 

 schist is a dark-green to black foliated or ligniform epidotic quartz- 

 hornblende schist considered by Emerson to be of sedimentary 

 origin. The hornblende schist is bordered at several places with 

 lenticular intrusive masses of serpentine. 



The emery vein consists of a mixture of chlorite and magnetite 

 containing in abundance bronze colored crystals of corundum, and 

 a considerable quantity of tourmaline in black crystals or stellated 

 aggregates. In passing from the hornblende schist to the serpen- 

 tine the following sequence is noted: hornblende schist, biotite layer, 

 chloritic band with tourmaline, emery vein with various minerals, 

 corundophilite zone, talc zone, and finally serpentine. The corun- 

 dophilite zone may be wholly replaced by a white to reddish, fine 

 grained saccharoidal oligoclase up to twelve inches in thickness. 



One of the most interesting sections is that of the mine at the 

 base of South Mountain. The serpentine on the east passes into 

 a zone of pure, light-green, schistose or massive talc, through 

 which are scattered remnants of serpentine from which the talc was 

 derived. The width of this zone varied from five to fifteen feet.

Beyond this is the corundophilite zone 39 composed of plates of cor- 

 undophilite 20 mm. broad, which may be wholly replaced by oligo- 

 clase. The corundophilite often penetrates the emery vein in 

 sheets filling fissures, on which may occur in cavities fine foliated 

 sheets of pearly margarite, and thick masses of interlaced blades 

 and crystals of violet diaspore, frequently enclosing bright red 

 needles of rutile, or broad plates of ilmenite. 39 Rarely associated 

 with these are radiating yellowish green needles of epidote, or brown 

 crystals of brookite. To a much later period of mineralization be- 

 long veins of specular hematite in small rosettes, pyrite, chalcopy- 

 rite, calcite, and aragonite. 



It will be seen that the mineralogy of this deposit is quite com- 

 plex. However, the presence of such minerals as tourmaline, oligo- 

 clase, rutile, brookite, etc., the evidence of reaction with the serpen- 

 tine, and the features resembling the plumasites described above, 

 all indicate that this deposit probably owes its origin largely to the 

 desilication of a granitic pegmatite intruded along the contact of 

 the hornblende schist and serpentine.- 



Georgia: The Georgia corundum deposits have been described 

 by Francis P. King. 40 All of the deposits occur in ultrabasic rocks 

 forming intrusive masses in the gneisses and schists. The veins 

 vary in form, and are from one to twelve feet in width. The fol- 

 lowing four types were recognized by King: (a) lime-soda feldspar 

 with quartz and phlogopite or vermiculite, (b) lime-soda feldspar 

 with actinolite ; (c) a coarse-grained aggregate of lime-soda feldspar, 

 black hornblende, and margarite; (d) a massive vein made up of 

 light grass-green amphibole ("smaragdite"), lime-soda feldspar, 

 and a little chromite. All these types have walls of compact, scaly 

 chlorite, which quite frequently contains corundum. The second 

 type (b) is rare, and the corundum crystals usually possess a sheath- 

 ing of secondary margarite. The third type (c) is more common 

 than (b), but it differs from the first two in its massive, pegmatitic 

 character. The fourth type (d) is very rare, being known only at 

 the Bell Creek mine, Towns County, and in Clay County, North 

 Carolina. The rock is made up of a beautiful grass-green bladed 

 smaragdite, and feldspar, through which are scattered pink and 

 ruby-red corundum.

cased in finely fibrous actinolite was found. The most important 

 mine, however, was that at Laurel Creek, Rabun County, which 

 occurred near the contact of peridotite and gneiss. 



North Carolina: The corundum deposits of North Carolina 

 have been described in detail by Joseph Hyde Pratt and J. Volney 

 Lewis. 41 They occur largely in areas of peridotites and pyroxeni- 

 tes intrusive in the gneisses and schists in the mountain belt ex- 

 tending from Georgia through Clay, Macon, Transylvania, Jackson, 

 Haywood, Buncombe, Madison, Yancey, and Mitchell Counties. 

 The peridotites are usually dunite or saxonite, but secondary ser- 

 pentine, talc, chlorite, and amphibole schists occur.

dotite. In all cases interesting series of contact zones are ex- 

 hibited (figs. 11 to 13). 



Important deposits were worked in Clay County near Elf on 

 Shooting Creek, on Chunk Gal Mountain, and at Buck Creek. At 

 the Buck Creek or Cullakenee mine, the corundum occurred as 

 grayish-white, bluish, or pink crystals with a deep green smaragdite, 

 and a white granular plagioclase, ranging in composition from an- 

 desine to anorthite. Associated with these were grayish columnar

 of the plagioclase are given below.

 veins in the feldspar. 



One of the most important mines was the Corundum Hill or

 The veins were of both the border and interior types (figs. 11 and 

 and 12). An analysis of oligoclase from this locality is given be- 

 low. In addition, large masses of black tourmaline containing cor- 

 undum were found, and very rarely margarite, and minute crystals 

 of diaspore.

The origin of the North Carolina deposits has been a much dis- 

 cussed question. The contact zones were described early by She- 

 pard, 42 Chatard, 43 and others. 



Julien, 44 although regarding the dunite beds as metamorphosed 

 sediments, believed that the veins originated by the introduction 

 of deep seated solutions of soda and alumina into fissures during 

 the period of metamorphism. 



Chatard pointed out the progressive increase in magnesia as the 

 dunite is approached and a gradual decrease in the amount of 

 alumina. He regarded the corundum veins as the result of altera- 

 tions along the contact of aluminous-alkaline silicate rocks and 

 magnesian-silicate rocks, probably effected by surface solutions. 



Because of the circumstance that many of the corundum deposits 

 occurred at the margins of peridotite masses, Pratt and Lewis 45 

 presented the theory of their origin as magmatic segregations of a 

 peridotite magma. It was believed that the corundum was held 

 in solution in the molten peridotite when it was intruded, and that 

 the corundum was among the first minerals to crystallize out. This 

 solidification would take place first at the outer border of the mass 

 where it cooled first. Convection currents would tend to bring a 

 new supply of material carrying alumina to this outer zone where 

 it would crystallize. 



Holland 4 ', and Teall 47 , presented objections to this theory based 

 on the rather old experiments of Morozewicz 48 , which indicated 

 that in a magma supersaturated with silica, that is, one in which 

 the molecular ratio of A1 2 3 to the bases CaO, K 2 0, and Na 2 is 

 more than 1:1, the excess of silica would separate out as corundum 

 if MgO and FeO were absent and Si0 2 were not present in an 

 amount sufficient to form sillimanite. With the presence of MgO 

 and FeO spinel would form, or if enough silica were present iolite 

 (cordierite). 



More recently the ternary system MgO-Al 2 3 -Si0 2 was studied 

 in detail by Rankin and Merwin. 49 The results of their precise

work indicate that corundum would not be expected as an early- 

 phase in the crystallization of a dry magma near peridotite in com- 

 position. It is clear that evidence of magmatic segregations of. cor- 

 undum in ultrabasic rocks is lacking. , 



On the other hand the presence of abundant tourmaline, much 

 plagioclase, with garnet, zoisite, vermiculite, etc., is indicative of 

 pegmatitic assemblages, and it is therefore more probable that 

 these corundum veins represent granitic pegmatites which have so 

 reacted with the wall rocks as to almost lose their identity. The 

 contact zones are somewhat different from those of the plumasites 

 described above, but wide variations are to be expected depending 

 on the composition of the original pegmatitic solutions, and even 

 more so on the character of the peridotite or pyroxenite, and on 

 whether these had already been hydrated to serpentine. It may 

 be noted that much magnesia was assimilated by the pegmatitic 

 solutions with the formation of much chlorite and biotite (since al- 

 tered to vermiculite) and some spinel in the corundum veins. The 

 distinct chloritic zones are evidence of reaction with the wall rock, 

 whereby alumina was furnished by the pegmatitic solutions, and 

 magnesia by the peridotite. The zone of enstatite may be ex- 

 plained by silication of the olivine, perhaps by the reaction 

 Mg i Si0 4 + SiO.=2MgSi0 3 or the mineral may have been produced 

 by abstraction of some of the magnesia. Incidentlyit is rather unus- 

 ual to find enstatite rather than anthophyllite. The position of the 

 talc zone between the dunite and the enstatite is anomalous, but it 

 might be noted that most of the analyses of the North Carolina dun- 

 ites show the presence of water, and more or less alteration to serp- 

 entine. 



Summary of Mineralogy of Desilicated Granitic 

 Pegmatites. 



The mineralogical composition of this group depends largely on 

 the composition of the original pegmatitic solutions, that of the 

 wall rock (peridotite, pyroxenite, serpentine, etc.), and the degree 

 of desilication or extent of reaction between the two. Variations in 

 the character of the zones also occur. In some cases different per- 

 iods of mineralization, some distinctly later than others, may occur. 

 The minerals, exclusive of those occurring in the contact zone, 

 which are more properly to be regarded as contact metamorphs of 

 the peridotites, serpentines, etc., are listed below. 




Primary. Trisilicdtes (feldspars): albite, oligoclase, andesine. 

 labradorite, anorthite. Metasilicates (amphiboles) : actinolite, 

 hornblende (edenite), (miscellaneous) beryl. Orthosilicates (gar- 

 nets): almandite, rhodolite, (boro-) tourmaline, (oxy-) sillimanite, 

 (hydroxy-) epidote, zoisite, allanite; (micas) muscovite, damourite, 

 euphyllite, biotite, margarite; (chlorites) corundophilite, etc. 

 Hydrous metasilicates: chabazite, wellsite. Phosphates: apatite. 

 Oxides: corundum, spinel, diaspore, rutile, brookite, ilmenite, 

 quartz (rare). Sulfides: molybdenite, pyrite. 



Weathering Products. Hydrous silicates: kaolinite, colerainite, 

 vermiculite (jefferisite), etc. Carbonates: aragonite. Hydrous 

 oxides: limonite.

SOUTH AMERICAN BLATTIDAE FROM THE MUSEUM NATIONAL 

 D'HISTOIRE NATURELLE, PARIS, FRANCE. 



BY MORGAN HEBARD. 



Having recently reported on the undetermined American Der- 

 maptera of the Paris Museum, 1 the undetermined American Blat- 

 tidae were next sent us for study by Monsieur Lucien Berland of 

 that institution. The North American material does not include 

 any large collections and will be reported on in several papers based 

 largely on the Philadelphia collections and now in the' course of 

 preparation. 



The South American series, on the other hand, proved to be large 

 and intensely interesting. As it was almost entirely from three very 

 distinct regions (French Guiana, southeastern Brazil and northern 

 Argentina), we have prepared a single report on the collections, divid- 

 ing it into three sections on a geographic basis and have included 

 material of our own collections which had not previously been 

 studied. 



The series sent by the Paris Museum has been returned, with the 

 exception of sets of duplicates, now in the collection of the author, 

 deposited at The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. 

 We have also been most generously permitted to retain certain 

 unique individuals of previously known species, of great importance 

 in our futher studies on the subject. For these, an equivalent in 

 other material has been sent the Paris Museum. 



The 637 specimens recorded represent 49 genera and 99 species, 

 of which 8 genera and 34 species are described as new. 



We wish to thank most heartily, Monsieur Lucien Berland and 

 Docteur Lucien Chopard, for their kind assistance in affording us 

 the opportunity to study this material. 



Section I. French Guiana. 



This series represents the first large collection of Blattidae to be 

 studied from French Guiana. The series includes 103 specimens, 



1 Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1920, pp. 337 to 353, (1921).

representing 23 genera and 32 species, of which 3 genera and 9 

 species are new. Though large, the collection probably includes 

 only a small percentage of the Blattidae to be found in French 

 Guiana, one of the richest regions of tropical South America. 



Among the new species, most remarkable and interesting are; 

 Sciablatta poecila, Leuropeltis atopa, Zetoborella gemmicula and 

 Oulopteryx dascilloides. The large Panchlorid, Schizopilia fissi- 

 collis, is one of the most interesting species of the region, due to 

 the extraordinary pronotal specialization. This species appears 

 to be rare in collections. 



ECTOBIINAE. 



Anaplecta maronensis new species. Plate IX, figure 3. 



This minute insect agrees closely with A. cabimae Hebardin size 

 and form; differing in the buffy pronotal disk with large prouts 

 brown suffused area above the head, buckthorn brown and conse- 

 quently distinctly less tawny tegmina and decidedly longer appen- 

 dicular field of the wings. 



Type : 9 : La Forestiere, Upper Maroni River, French Guiana.

Size very small, form slender for the genus. Head scarcely longer 

 than broad ; vertex evenly convex, without distinct ridges over the 

 antennal sockets; ocellar spots subobsolete. Pronotum approach- 

 ing oval, the caudal margin showing no more truncation than the 

 mesal portion of the cephalic margin, very feebly obtuse-angulate 

 convex; surface weakly convex, with no trace of discal sulci. Teg- 

 mina extending a brief distance beyond apex of abdomen, narrow; 

 costal margin very feebly convex to near the apex, where it bends 

 more sharply to meet the sutural margin, which is almost straight, 

 apex sharply rounded; costal veins inconspicuous, not numerous 

 ( 8 ), with a few spurious intermediate veins distad; discoidal sectors 

 two in number. Wings not broad; costal veins simple, subobsolete 

 in clouded area ( 4 to 5 ), combining with the similar distal veinlets 

 (4 to 5), which also spring from the discoidal vein as it curves to 

 meet the median vein at the distal extremity of the medio-discoidal 

 area; medio-discoidal area, before this point, without transverse 

 veinlets; appendicular field in length about four-fifths that of re- 

 maining portion of wing, length appreciably greater than width. 

 Supra-anal plate roundly produced, showing scarcely any angulation. 

 Subgenital plate of the valvular type characteristic of the genus. 

 Ventro-cephalic margin of cephalic femora with a single very slender

 dextrad. 



Head chestnut brown. Pronotum with disk ochraceous-buff, 

 with a large suffusion of prouts brown in area above the head, lat-

This specimen, the first male of the present species to be studied, 

 is seen to have the supra-anal plate large, extending as far as the 

 subgenital plate, with lateral margins converging weakly, then more 

 strongly and curving into the truncate distal portion. The sub- 

 genital plate with distal margin between the styles transverse and 

 moderately hairy, the dextral margin simple, oblique, the sinistral 

 margin transverse to sinistral style, with surface of plate in that 

 section broadly channeled, this portion produced into the sinistral 

 style, which is straight, produced for a brief distance, the margin 

 at the inner margin of this style suddenly produced for a short dis- 

 tance, in consequence of which the sinistral style is deeply inset, its 

 projecting portion equal in size and extending caudad the same 

 distance as the well-socketed, simple dextral style.

PSEUDOMOPINAE. 



Sciablatta poecila 3 new species. Plate IX, figures 12, 13, 14 and 15. 



The comparatively thorough color description of Walker's Blatta 

 varicornis from Santarem, Brazil, 4 leaves little doubt but that the 

 present species is very closely related. From that description, 

 varicornis appears to differ only in the tegmina; "brown, with whit- 

 ish veins, and with a broad whitish hyaline costal space which tapers 

 towards the tip." The structural characters will probably show 

 much more important differences for that species, though we feel 

 that it may safely be assigned to Sciablatta. 



Compared with the genotype, S. mamatoco Hebard, described 

 from Santa Marta, Colombia, 5 poecila differs in the male sex in the 

 smaller size, broader form, delicate but more intricate and extensive 

 markings, proportionately much broader pronotum, proportionately 

 broader tegmina, with apices more nearly median in position and 

 discoidal sectors slightly more oblique and subgenital plate, with 

 the fused styles, much more elongate and slender. 



In the specialization of the male subgenital plate and dorsal sur- 

 face of the abdomen, greatest convergence in the known species of 

 the Blattellae to the characteristic type found in the Oxyhaloid 

 genus Chorisoneura is shown by this species. 



The intricate markings of this insect are so delicate, except on 

 head and antennae, that their real beauty is not realized until a 

 microscopic examination is made. 



Type : cf ; St. Jean du Maroni, French Guiana. March. [Paris

Size medium small for the Group Blattellae, form very broad 

 for the Group. Interocular space moderately broad, three-quarters 

 as wide as that between the antennal sockets, flattened and show- 

 ing weak, irregular impressions. Lateral margins of cheeks con- 

 verging distinctly ventrad. Maxillary palpi very short, third joint 

 very slightly longer than the enlarged fifth joint, fourth joint two- 

 thirds as long, enlarged regularly and considerably distad. Tegmen 

 with discoidal vein an equal distance from the costal and sutural 

 margins mesad, costal margin rounding toward sutural slightly 

 more than is usual in the Group, discoidal sectors (13 and 15) de- 

 cidedly oblique, as oblique as the costal veins. Wings with (8) 

 proximal costal veins moderately thickened in distal portions,

 two-thirds as broad as long. Dorsal surface of abdomen with sixth 

 tergite shallowly concave meso-proximad, this area transverse oval 

 in outline, its surface carpeted with agglutinated hairs. Seventh 

 and eighth tergites distinctly narrower, moderately exposed along 

 their caudal margins. Supra-anal plate triangular with apex 

 blunted, subchitinous, subemarginate, its length approximately 

 two-fifths its basal width, showing no slight emargination at the 

 cereal bases as does that of mamatoco. Cerci much as in that species, 

 but smaller, the (10) joints similarly well defined. Paired plate 

 beneath supra-anal plate large and unspecialized. Subgenital 

 plate with surface very weakly convex, very short, sinistral portion 

 slightly more produced than dextral, caudal margin nearly trans- 

 verse, showing very slight production to median fourth, dextrad 

 very feebly concave, median portion fusing with the large, elongate 

 and lamellate styles, which are represented by nearly vertical 

 plates, attingent at their distal extremities, each about two and 

 one-half tunes as long as its basal width, the disto-dorsal angle very 

 broadly convex, the disto-ventral angle bluntly, but much more 

 sharply, convex. These plate-like cerci in the present species give 

 to the subgenital plate a strongly Chorisoneurine facies. Limb 

 armament, pulvilli, arolia and tarsal claws as characteristic of the 

 genus. 6 



General coloration buffy, with a faint tinge of buckthorn brown. 

 Head very pale flesh color, occiput with four irregular, vertical 

 streaks and flecks of dark prouts brown , a transverse band of prouts 

 brown between the eyes just above the ocelli, narrow laterad but 

 wider mesad, due to the greater convexity of its dorsal margin, a 

 very broad transverse band of prouts brown between the antennal 

 sockets, which contains a very broadly V-shaped transverse buffy 

 area mesad. Mouthparts and palpi clear clay-color. Antennae 

 in proximal (24 joints) portions clear clay-color, succeeding ten 

 joints mummy brown, followed by a striking and broad annulus (in- 

 cluding 5 joints) of warm buff, the remaining distal joints mummy 

 brown. Pronotum with disk light ochraceous-buff, broad lateral 

 portions transparent, the whole faintly tinged with buckthorn

LEUROPELTIS 7 new genus. 



This genus is erected to include one of the most aberrant forms 

 of the Group Blattellae known to us. The broad flattened head 

 and prominent eyes suggest a further development of the type 

 usually shown by species of the Group Euphyllodromiae. The flat 

 pronotum and armament of the ventro-cephalic margins of the 

 cephalic femora afford distinctive characters.

 in the present insect), character of limb armament, pulvilli, tarsal

claws and arolia, Leuropeltis differs very strikingly from the Nycti- 

 borine genus Pseudischnoptera in the even more decidedly flattened 

 and shorter head, eyes which are more decidedly developed laterad 

 and extend ventrad well beyond the antennal sockets, more trans- 

 verse, oval pronotum with greatest width mesad and lateral portions 

 not at all deflexed, broader tegmina with longer anal field, spurious 

 veins absent and discoidal sectors decidedly oblique, broader wings 

 with area of costal veins much wider and ulnar vein with all branches 

 complete, unspecialized median segment but specialized sixth 

 abdominal tergite of male, very distinctive genitalic development 

 in this sex, ventro-cephalic margin of cephalic femora with two 

 heavier terminal spines and both cephalic and caudal ventral mar- 

 gins of other limbs armed, the caudal margins less heavily than in 

 Pseudischnoptera. 



In linear arrangement, the genus can not be satisfactorily assigned, 

 due to the fact that many aberrant genera of the Group Blattellae 

 exist, radiating away from the normal toward other totally different 

 types. We place Leuropeltis after Liosilpha Stal, from which genus, 

 however, it is very widely separated. 



Genotype. â€” Leuropeltis atopa new species. 



Generic Description. Genus known only from the male sex. 

 Head flattened, eyes large, widely separated and prominent, 

 antennae coarse and well supplied with short hairs. Pronotum 

 rectangularly oval, moderately transverse, greatest width mesad, 

 surface flat, the disk showing two pairs of oblique impressions. Teg- 

 mina long and broad, anal field elongate, discoidal sections strongly 

 oblique. Wings fully developed, marginal field extending over half 

 distance to apex, scapular field very broad in distal half, costal 

 veins thickening but not clubbed distad, ulnar vein with branches 

 complete, intercalated triangle subobsolete. Abdomen with latero- 

 caudal angles of five proximal tergites sharp, rectangulate, weakly 

 produced, tergites decidedly narrower after sixth, sixth tergite 

 specialized mesad. Cephalic femora with ventro-cephalic margin 

 unarmed except in distal third, where it is supplied with short, stout 

 spines, terminating in two heavier elongate distal spines, of which 

 the more distal is slightly the more elongate ; ventro-caudal margin 

 unarmed except in distal third, where it is supplied with a few mod- 

 erately large, elongate spines. Other ventral femoral margins 

 moderately supplied with similar spines, which, particularly on the 

 cephalic margins, are not as heavy or as large as those often 

 developed in the Pseudomopinae. Caudal metatarsus armed 

 ventrad with two rows of minute spinulae and supplied distad with 

 a moderately large pulvillus, three succeeding tarsal joints supplied 

 with similar pulvilli, occupying their entire ventral surfaces. Large

Leuropeltis atopa new species. Plate X, figures 11, 12 and 13. 



This species is so distinctive that a helpful comparison can hardly 

 be made with any known Blattid. The rich brown of the tegmina 

 and pronotal disk, pale lateral portions of the pronotum and bicol- 

 ored antennae, are the more striking features of coloration. 



Type: o" ; Gourdonville, French Guiana. October. [Paris Mu- 

 seum.] 



We add the following features to those given in the generic diag- 

 nosis. Interocular space (1.1 mm.) three-quarters as wide as that 

 between the antennal sockets. Ocellar spots small. Inter-ocular- 

 ocellar area flattened, very weakly concave. Maxillary palpi with 

 distal joint equal in length to third, the dorsal margin showing a 

 very weak concavity, fourth joint three-quarters as long as third, 

 enlarging evenly and rather strongly distad. Pronotum with mar- 

 gin above head transverse, showing a very feeble convexity, caudal 

 margin transverse very broadly and weakly convex, lateral margins 

 evenly convex; first pair of impressions on disk situated slightly 

 cephalad of the median line and parallel to the normally placed latero- 

 caudal sulci. Tegmina with greatest width at apex of anal field, 

 thence narrowing very feebly to distal portion where the narrowing 

 is more decided, particularly on the sutural margin, with apex sit- 

 uated slightly beyond the median point toward the costal margin. 

 Wings with (12) thickened costal veins; ulnar vein with six branches, 

 two of which again divide before the margin of the wing. Sixth 

 tergite subchitinous in median portion, with a small, rounded prom- 

 inence mesad near the caudal margin of the preceding tergite, the 

 bases of which prominence latero-cephalad are supplied on each 

 side with a minute tuft of agglutinated hairs. Supra-anal plate 

 triangularly produced, with apex curving ventrad and broadly 

 rounded, length two-fifths distance between cereal bases. Cercus 

 with ten joints, the tenth moderately elongate oval. 8 Subgenital 

 plate moderately asymmetrical, the sinistral margin situated 

 further caudad than the dextral, straight, transverse to median 

 section; the dextral margin broadly concave oblique to median 

 section; median section with two large and roughly triangularly 

 rounded plates on each side, the sinistral more inset, due to the 

 position of the sinistral free margin, between these the median por- 

 tion of the plate is produced in a large, but no more produced, like- 

 wise roughly triangular plate, the emarginations between this and 

 the styles (developed into plates in this species) rather broadly V- 

 shaped. Ventro-cephalic margin of cephalic femora with (6 and 7) 

 short stout spines distad, ventro-caudal margin with (3) heavier,

 one and one-quarter times as long as combined length of succeeding 

 joints. 



Head and palpi chestnut brown, obscurely vertically streaked 

 with paler on occiput, ocellar spots buffy. Antennae blackish 

 chestnut brown in proximal third, thence hazel. Pronotum black- 

 ish chestnut brown in large truncate-trigonal area, margined very 

 narrowly laterad with warm buff; lateral portions transparent, very 

 feebly tinged with buff. Tegmina weakly translucent, clear solid 

 hazel tinged with chestnut brown, particularly at the humeral trunk 

 and along the costal margin. Wings transparent, anterior field 

 tinged with saccardos umber, heaviest in area of enlarged portion 

 of costal veins, very weak between discoidal and ulnar veins except 

 distad and very weak between unbranched portion of ulnar vein 

 and anal sulcus; radiate field very weakly tinged with saccardos 

 umber, the veins of that color. Dorsal surface of mesonotum, 

 metanotum and abdomen shining and very dark chestnut brown. 

 Cerci dark chestnut brown. Ventral surface and limbs blackish, 

 the subgenital plate and limbs beyond the femora paling to very 

 dark chestnut brown.

Study of the Guianan material now in the Philadelphia collec- 

 tions and of the literature, furnishes much evidence indicating the 

 above synonymy. Rehn 's pavonacea was described at a time when 

 little material was available, and the generic association of the 

 American Blattidae in chaos. The description of Serville 's alter- 

 nans was thus apparently overlooked, while nothing could be done 

 with Uterata of Burmeister, until much Guianan material could 

 be secured. 



It is unfortunate that Burmeister 's wretched description of 

 Uterata, occupying less than two lines, has a year's priority over 

 Serville 's readily recognizable diagnosis of alternans.

Euphyllodromia chopardi 8 new species. Plate XV, figures 1 and 2. 



This species is related to E . fasciatella (Saussure), differing in the 

 slightly larger eyes, slightly narrower interocular space, heavier 

 latero-caudal depressions of pronotal disk, heavier and differently 

 specialized appendages of the male subgenital plate and longer 

 caudal metatarsi. 



In coloration it differs in having the maxillary palpi not immacu- 

 late, as the distal joint is suffused with mummy brown in its ventral 

 marginal portion; the pronotal disk margined with a narrow whitish 

 suffusion and not immaculate, but having two heavy, extensive 

 lateral suffusions of dark brown, which fuse caudad, and the teg- 

 mina with similar translucent and transparent areas, but entirely 

 lacking pearl gray lines and spots. 



Type: d 1 ; Bartica, British Guiana. December 19, 1912. (H. S. 

 Parish. ) [Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., Type no. 5369.] 



Size rather small, form moderately slender for the genus, delicate 

 structure normal. Head with interocular space (.6 mm.) about 

 three-fifths width between antennal sockets. Ocellar spots small 

 and weakly defined. Maxillary palpi with third joint three-quarters 

 as long as fourth; fourth very strongly triquetrous, widening evenly 

 distad so that it becomes fully two and one-half times as wide as 

 third; fifth joint three-quarters as long as fourth, moderately ex- 

 panded, greatest width near base, ventral margin sub-convex and 

 oblique from that point to apex. Pronotum rather decidedly trans- 

 verse; cephalic margin weakly convex, truncate; lateral margins 

 rather strongly convex, this greatest caudad ; caudal margin trans- 

 verse, but showing an even and very broad obtuse-angulation, with 

 angle very broadly convex; discal sulci very broad but well devel- 

 oped. Tegmen and wings elongate and very delicate. Dorsal 

 surface of abdomen as described for E. decastigmata Hebard, 10 appar- 

 ently characteristic of the genus, sixth tergite very shallowly con- 

 cave in mesal portion, there rather thickly supplied with agglutin- 

 ated hairs. Supra-anal plate strongly transverse, broadly and 

 weakly triangularly produced between the cereal bases, with rounded 

 apex obtuse-angulate. Cercus as in decastigmata, tapering to the 

 acute apex. Paired plate beneath supra-anal plate large and un- 

 specialized. Subgenital plate almost symmetrical, the sinistral mar- 

 gin almost straight, the dextral margin rather strongly concave to 

 the median portion; median portion with two deeply inset, large

plates, which are attingent distad; the sinistral as long as broad 

 and nearly triangular, with broad apex rounded; the dextral twice 

 as long as broad and nearly rectangular, with similar apex; fitting 

 tightly between the bases of these styles is a triangular plate, with 

 dextral margin curled slightly caudad and armed with minute, 

 sharp, straight teeth, which slant slightly proximad. Armament 

 of limbs, pulvilli, tarsal claws and arolia as characteristic of the 

 genus. Succeeding tarsal joints only half as long as caudal meta- 

 tarsus. 



Allotype: 9 ; same data as type, but taken February 10, 1913. 

 [Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila.] 



Agrees closely with type in coloration, color-pattern and in 

 structural features except the following. Interocular space slightly 

 over half width between antennal sockets. Dorsal surface of abdo- 

 men unspecialized. Supra-anal plate very strongly transverse, the 

 free margin very weakly obtuse-angulate convex on each side to 

 the weakly concave median portion. Subgenital plate with lateral 

 margins feebly convex and hardly convergent to opposite cereal 

 bases, thence rounding strongly and oblique, broadly concave to 

 distal portion, which is strongly V-emarginate, the apices thus 

 formed broadly rounded, the emargination occupied by a soft 

 mantle. 



Head, underparts and limbs weak ochraceous-tawny, the occiput 

 slightly deeper than the face, abdomen ochraceous-tawny with 

 styles largely suffused with chestnut brown. Maxillary palpi light 

 buff, the half of the distal joint toward the ventral margin heavily 

 suffused with mummy brown (this showing variation in width in 

 the series), broader on the caudal than on the cephalic face. An- 

 tennae with first joint ochraceous-tawny, succeeding joints blackish 

 mummy brown, the proximal joints sometimes ochraceous-tawny 

 dorsad. Pronotum in all but discal portion transparent, faintly 

 tinged with buckthorn brown and with a weakly defined, narrow, 

 opaque margin of whitish about the disk; disk tawny, with two 

 large suffusions of mummy brown, which unite caudad and send 

 a very short stout ray cephalad into the median paler area. In 

 intensive examples these suffusions almost completely obliterate 

 the paler median area, leaving only a medio-longitudinal line and 

 fleck of ochraceous-tawny cephalad. Tegmina with marginal field, 

 areas between discoidal and median veins and anal sulcus and the 

 two mesal areas between veins of anal field transparent, very faintly 

 tinged with buckthorn brown; remaining portions more heavily 

 tinged with buckthorn brown, becoming cinnamon-brown in proxi- 

 mal area of costal veins proximad and tapering to a weak mars 

 brown suffusion in this area distad; the sutural margin, particularly 

 in the anal field and area between anal sulcus and first vein of anal 

 field, rather heavily suffused with mars brown; a broad suffusion 

 of ochraceous-orange sweeping obliquely across the discoidal field, 




204 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Part II 



beyond the apex of the anal field. Wings transparent, iridescent, 

 feebly suffused distad, veins chestnut brown, a median suffusion 

 of chestnut brown in area of costal veins, beyond which the narrow 

 marginal area is buffy. Mesonotum ochraceous-tawny, heavily 

 and extensively suffused with mummy brown in latero-cephalic 

 portions covered by the pronotum, this showing through that trans- 

 parent portion of the pronotum and giving it the appearance of 

 being darkened caudad, with a meso-caudal fleck of warm buff; 

 metanotum similar except that there is no median fleck, but a 

 similar fleck of warm buff on each side caudad of the dark suffusions. 

 Dorsal surface of abdomen ochraceous-orange, the median segment 

 with a heavy transverse suffusion of mummy brown, which in in- 

 tensive examples occupies the entire segment and is blackish.

cussed at considerable length by Saussure. 13 The following fea- 

 tures have, however, never been given. 



Pronotum very much flattened but with comparatively narrow 

 pale lateral portions showing some slight deflection, greatest width 

 at latero-caudal angles. Tegmina with discoidal sectors almost 

 longitudinal, false longitudinal veins as decided as the veins them- 

 selves and with supplementary false veinlets between these in dis- 

 tal portions. Limbs comparatively short and heavy. Ventro- 

 cephalic margin of cephalic femora armed in distal third with (5 

 and 8) short but decidedly stout spines, terminating in three heavier 

 spines, slightly more elongate in slightly increasing ratio distad, 

 ventro-caudal margin with (4) heavier, longer spines in distal 

 third. Large pul villi present between the rather stout, simple, 

 nearly symmetrical tarsal claws. Median segment with a large, 

 transverse, median depression, formed by the fusion of two circular 

 depressions. 14 Supra-anal plate triangularly produced, with a 

 large, straight, heavy spine directed caudad at each side of the 

 broadly rounded apex. Concealed genitalia including at least 

 three very heavy, slightly curved spines. Subgenital plate as 

 figured. 



Length of body 17-17.6, width of interocular space .9, length of 

 pronotum 4.8-4.8, width of pronotum 6.6-6.5, length of tegmen 

 17.7-18, width of tegmen 5.3-5.7, length of wing 14, width of wing 

 7.7 mm. 



This insect does not belong to the Pseudomopinae, as has been 

 supposed, but is clearly a member of a distinctive group of the 

 Nyctiborinae. This is shown by the general structure, character 

 of tegminal and wing venation, limb characters and type of male 

 subgenital plate, which type is found in numerous species of this 

 subfamily only. The genus does not agree with the majority of the 

 genera of the Nyctiborinae, showing complete absence of pilosity 

 and only very slightly asymmetrical tarsal claws.

The present specimens appear to agree with Burmeister 's two 

 line description of holosericea better than any we have previously 

 seen from South America. Comparing the material here recorded 

 with Central American specimens of N. noctivaga Rehn, the two 

 species, as here recognized, are seen to be very closely related.

In the Guianan material the interocellar area is not dark, being 

 as pale as, or paler than, the face; in the specimens of noctivaga the 

 interocular area, to slightly below the ocelli, is very dark, darker 

 than the face in paler examples, as dark as the face when the face 

 is very dark. The dorsal surface of the abdomen is comparatively 

 pale, darkening slightly caudad, without striking markings. In 

 the males the supra-anal plate differs.

Hyporhicnoda maronensis new species. Plate XII, figure 5. 



This species is very closely related to H. litomorpha Hebard, 

 from Colombia. Decided similarity is shown by the color and 

 texture of the dorsal surface in the female sex. It differs in the 

 more slender form, head with narrower interocular space and slightly 

 heavier impressed punctae, stronger convexity of the thoracic seg- 

 ments and in the decidedly greater reduction of the limb armament. 



Type: 9 ; La Forestiere, upper Maroni River, French Guiana. 

 [Paris Museum]. 



Size medium, form elongate and rather narrowly oval for the 

 genus, the greatest width being across the abdomen mesad. Head 

 hidden under pronotum, broad, the reduced eyes widely separated 

 by a distance (1.8 mm.) slightly greater than that between the 

 weakly defined ocellar spots; exposed surface coarsely and rather 

 thickly impresso-punctate, face flattened, very feebly convex, with 

 two transverse impressions just below and between the ocellar areas 

 and showing very slight concavity on each side above the labial 

 suture. Pronotum extending well beyond head, showing a very 

 feeble subcucullate condition, very strongly convex to the scarcely 

 reflexed, narrow lateral portions of the cephalic margin; this margin 

 subcingulate, broadly convex mesad but more strongly so than in 

 litomorpha, with lateral margins broadly convex to the latero-caudal 

 angles, which are rounded and weakly produced caudad, forming 

 an angle of slightly less than ninety degrees; caudal margin broadly 

 convex mesad, showing broad and very weak convexity laterad, 

 so that it is nearly transverse. Mesonotum and metanotum with 

 latero-caudal angles produced and sharply rounded. Entire dorsal 

 surface apparently smooth, somewhat polished, but under high 

 magnification seen to be supplied with minute flattened rounded 

 rugae, these slightly more apparent on the caudal margins of the 

 segments, so that they appear very finely beaded. Tegmina and 

 wings absent. Supra-anal plate heavily chitinous, over twice as 

 broad as long, the free margin convex, showing slight flattening 

 laterad and a trace of median emargination. Cerci very short 

 and lamellate, scarcely projecting beyond the body outline. Sub- 

 genital plate very large. Limbs showing very decided atrophy of 

 armament. Ventro-cephalic margin of cephalic femora armed with 

 three heavy spines, succeeded by an irregular row of rather elongate 

 chaetiform spines, terminated by a heavy distal spine. Other ven- 

 tral femoral margins, except caudal margins of caudal femora, 

 which are wholly unarmed, supplied with a single heavy distal spine, 

 all with widely spaced large spiniform hairs. Tarsi heavy, caudal 

 metatarsus as long as combined length of succeeding tarsal joints, 

 with two rows of spines ventrad and more distantly placed spines 

 on the sides. Four proximal tarsal joints supplied with pulvilli, 

 these occupying the entire ventral surfaces except that of the meta- 




208 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Part II 



tarsus, the pul villus of which is distal and about twice as long as 

 wide. Tarsal claws simple, symmetrical, with very heavy bases. 

 Arolia absent. 



Dorsal surface blackish brown, the pronotum with a paired suf- 

 fusion of sayal brown, extending a brief distance along the cephalic 

 margin each side of the median point. Head tawny, the face dark- 

 ened to mars brown. Antennae and palpi ochraceous-tawny. Ven- 

 tral thoracic surface and limbs buckthorn brown, the latter with 

 femora tinged with tawny, the tibiae deepening to mars brown in 

 distal portions, spines mars brown. Ventral surface of abdomen 

 deep carob brown, paling to rich chestnut meso-proximad. 



Length of body 28.8, length of pronotum 9.5, width of pronotum 

 12.2, greatest body width 15.6, length of caudal femur 7.1, length 

 of caudal metatarsus 2 mm. 



In addition to the type, a single half-grown female, from Ilet la 

 Mere, French Guiana, is before us. This specimen bears an addi- 

 tional spine on the median portion of the ventro-cephalic margin of 

 the median femora, two similarly situated spines on the caudal fem- 

 ora and four and five proximal spines on the ventro-cephalic margins 

 of the cephalic femora.

This very remarkable insect was previously known from the 

 type and a single specimen, sent Guerin by Poey from Havana, Cuba. 

 The latter specimen, with certain others recorded by Guerin, 16 al- 

 most certainly came from South America and was included in the 

 Cuban list in error. 



Three immature individuals are before us from the same local- 

 ity and one from Cayenne, taken in April, 1906, which we believe 

 represent this species. The largest, apparently in the last stage 

 preceding maturity, like the others, shows no trace of lateral pro- 

 notal fissation and is in shape strongly flattened patelliform.

Association of the sexes and comparison with a topotype in the 

 Academy Collection and with the original description, furnish 

 convincing evidence that Burmeister 's emarginata represents the 

 male and his cicatricosa the female of the same species. In this 

 insect the female is slightly larger, with broader pronotum and teg- 

 mina than the male, the lateral angles of the pronotum subemar- 

 ginate caudad, not minutely but distinctly emarginate as in the 

 opposite sex. 



Walker's perspicua is an unquestioned synonym, as indicated by 

 Kirby. That author is, however, incorrect in placing limbata of 

 Brunner under emarginata and it is by no means clear that he is 

 justified in placing rudis of Walker in the same synonymy.

ZETOBORELLA new genus. 



This genus is erected to include the smallest and one of the most 

 remarkable species of those referable to the genus Zetobora and its 

 allies. 



In addition to the small size, the present genus is distinctive in 

 the extremely transverse pronotum, with latero-caudal angles bi- 

 emarginate, the caudal emargination being conspicuous. This 

 shows a further development of the type found in Zetobora emargin- 

 ata Burmeister. The pronotum has the cephalic margin very 

 broadly convex, without being broadly though conspicuously re- 

 flexed, in the latter respect agreeing with species of Tribonidium. 

 The pronotal surface is distinctive in being smooth and polished 

 over its greater portion, the remaining areas impresso-punctate. 

 The tegmina are suddenly emarginate mesad, when at rest leaving 

 the lamellate lateral marginal portions of the third to sixth tergites 

 exposed. The tegmina, though broad, are, as in Tribonidium, much 

 narrower than in Zetobora. 



Genotype. â€” Zetoborella gemmicula new species. 



Generic Description. Size very small for the group, form broad, 

 but with tegmina much narrower than in Zetobora. Head flat, with 

 face broadly and shallowly concave, dorsal outline semicircular, 

 width between the reduced eyes considerable. Ocelli represented 

 by shallow but moderately large concavities. Distal joints of 

 maxillary palpi very short, the last broad. Pronotum with cephalic 

 margin very broadly convex, caudal margin transverse, latero- 

 caudal angles bi-emarginate ; surface weakly trilobate, showing very 

 feeble reflection toward the lateral portions of the cephalic margin 

 and none mesad, surface smooth and shining except latero-caudad 

 and mesad toward the caudad margin, where it is impresso-punctate. 

 Mesonotum impresso-punctulate in the exposed scutellar area. 

 Tegmina and wings well developed, showing very slight reduction 

 in the female sex. Tegmina with very broad and short marginal 

 field, the scapular field narrowing suddenly and very strongly 

 proximad, discoidal field with veins and numerous cross-veins mod-

erately irregular, the former radiating. Wings with costal veins 

 almost obliterated beyond the elongate mediastine vein. Abdomen 

 with first to sixth tergites lamellate produced laterad, the first with 

 latero-caudal angles broadly rounded, the second to sixth with 

 these angles produced caudad and sharply rounded, seventh tergite 

 much narrower, eighth with very narrow caudal portion only ex- 

 posed. Supra-anal plate sub-bilobate. Cerci small and moderately 

 slender, with (9 or 10) joints strongly differentiated. Subgenital 

 plate of male of the usual asymmetrical lobiform type, with two 

 simple styles; of female ample, moderately emarginate at cereal 

 bases, truncate distad. Limbs completely unarmed, 17 lacking 

 genicular or other spines, ventro-caudal margins of median and cau- 

 dal femora supplied with well spaced hairs. Four proximal tarsal 

 joints scarcely longer than distal joint, supplied with large pulvilli. 

 Large arolia present between the simple, symmetrical tarsal claws.

The shining surface, smooth and very transverse pronotum and 

 emarginate tegmina, which leave the lateral portions of the dorsum 

 of the abdomen exposed, give this beautiful little insect a very dis- 

 tinctive appearance.

In addition to the features discussed above, we note the following. 

 Interocular width three times ocular depth. Fourth joint of maxil- 

 lary palpi half as long as third, fifth joint three-quarters as long as 

 third, greatly expanding, its greatest width equal to length of fourth 

 joint. 18 Pronotum extending well beyond head, with cucullation 

 above head flattened, surface broadly concave before the two latero- 

 caudal emarginations, the first of these very weak and lateral in 

 position, the second decided and caudad in position, twice as long 

 as broad, with angulate-emargination formed sharply rounded at 

 slightly less than a right angle. Tegmina extending slightly be- 

 yond cereal apices.

Very similar to male, except as follows. Interocular width three 

 and one-half times ocular depth. Maxillary palpi with fifth joint 

 as long as third and wider than length of fourth. Pronotum slightly 

 less strongly transverse, with latero-caudal emarginations less de- 

 cided, so that the caudal emarginations have the angulate-emar-

 the ventro-cephalic margin of the cephalic femora, which is supplied in distal 

 portion with a row of minute, chaetiform spines, terminated by a single stout, 

 though very small, distal spine. The metatarsus is equal in length to the distal 

 tarsal joint.

gination formed more broadly rounded at more than a right angle. 

 Tegmina extending almost to cereal apices. 



Head shining blackish brown. Antennae blackish brown, with 

 a very broad buff annulus (including ten to twelve joints) in distal 

 portion. Pronotum shining blackish brown in caudal section and 

 extending cephalad in median convexity above head, remaining 

 portions transparent, tinged with warm buff, the caudal margins 

 of this area transverse laterad, with what appears to be a blackish 

 brown suffusion at the angles, due to the fact that there the blackish 

 brown area extends slightly farther cephalad on the ventral surface 

 than on the dorsal face, cephalic margin very finely blackish brown. 

 Tegmina mummy brown, blackish brown when closed, translucent, 

 except marginal field which is opaque. Wings transparent, tinged 

 with mummy brown, this weak in radiate field. Dorsal surface of 

 abdomen blackish brown, with lamellate lateral sections of second 

 and third tergites warm buff in the female, this marking in the male 

 the same for the third tergite, but reduced to a small spot on the 

 second tergite. 19 Limbs and ventral surface prouts brown, deepen- 

 ing to blackish brown toward the abdominal periphery, but with 

 lamellate ventral portions of second and third tergites warm buff.

This species was placed by Saussure in what he considered the 

 second division of the genus Zetobora, (Phortioeca) . It unquestion- 

 ably belongs to Phortioeca and not to Zetobora (as assigned by Kirby) 

 This is shown by the type of pronotum, with section above head 

 more distinctly cucullate, cephalic margin not broadly reflexed 



19 The greater portion of this conspicuous pale marking is exposed when the 

 tegmina are at rest, due to the sudden emargination of those organs.

 punctate. The present material agrees fully with Saussure's ade-

 It is of interest to note that the measurements given by Burmeis-

These specimens, like a female from Trinidad, in the Hebard Col- 

 lection, differ from the type in having the pronotal markings fused 

 to different degrees. Such is the individual variability in these 

 markings that we feel confident that but one species is represented. 23 

 This species is clearly distinct from E. posticus (Erichson), but the 

 other described species 24 can not be vouched for, until extensive 

 series can be secured. The difficulty is that, at present, there is no 

 means of telling whether the various conditions described, with 

 pronotum more heavily marked and suffused, represent distinct 

 species or, in some cases, merely manifestations of decided intensive 

 coloration in individuals of the same species.

 variability of these markings.

CORYDIINAE. 



ODLOPTERYX 25 new genus. 



This genus of comparatively medium-small species is one of the 

 most distinctive found in tropical South America. 



Ocelli are absent, the pronotum is transversely strongly impressed 

 just before the cephalic margin, the pronotum and tegmina are 

 coriaceous and polished, thickly impresso-punctate, except distad 

 on the tegmina and very weakly to well supplied with hairs, the 

 wings are exceptionally large for the body bulk and have a large 

 appendicular field, which is not only folded but curled into a tight 

 roll when these organs are at rest, the ventral femoral margins are 

 unarmed except for a single distal spine on the ventro-cephalic mar- 

 gin of the cephalic femora, while pulvilli and arolia are absent. 



The curled tegmina show a further development of the type found 

 in the Ectobine genus Theganopteryx. The more than usually 

 coriaceous tegmina, particularly in one species, gives to the species 

 a decidedly coleOpteroid facies. 



Taking all of the characters into consideration the genus appears 

 to be an aberrant member of the Corydiinae, and we place it in 

 linear arrangement after Buboblatta Hebard and before Ceuthobiella, 

 here described, though showing a development from a very different 

 stock. 



Genotype. â€” Oulopteryx meliponarum new species. 26 



Generic Description. Size medium small, form elongate elliptical. 

 Head slightly longer than broad, supplied with a few scattered 

 hairs, eyes well separated, ocelli absent, maxillary palpi rather short 

 and heavy. Pronotum shining, coriaceous, with cephalic margin 

 transverse, caudal margin very broadly and weakly convex, greatest 

 width meso-cauded; surface heavily impresso-punctate and very 

 weakly to well supplied with scattered hairs, with a strong trans- 

 verse impression before the cephalic margin, the discal section ir- 

 regularly bossed, the narrow lateral portion weakly reflexed. Teg- 

 mina fully developed in male, showing slight reduction in female, 

 shining, moderately to decidedly coriaceous, with apex rather sharp-

ly rounded, surface heavily impresso-punctate, this disappearing 

 meso-distad, without hairs or well supplied with hairs, discoidal sectors 

 longitudinal; veins invisible except in certain lights, except in por- 

 tion of dextral tegmen concealed when at rest, which is subchitinous. 

 Wings very large in porportion to body bulk, costal veins not clubbed, 

 discoidal and median vein forming an elongate acute ellipse, crossed 

 by numerous transverse veinlets, an irregular network of veinlets 

 distad in area between the unbranched ulnar, anal and first branch 

 of the axillary vein; appendicular field with basal line rounded 

 obtuse-angulate, length nearly equal to width in males, length 

 distinctly less than width in females, this area folding and curling 

 into a tight roll when at rest; radiate field folding fanwise. Dorsal 

 surface of male abdomen with median segment specialized. Cerci 

 short, flattened dorsad, lateral margins complete. Male subgenital 

 plate symmetrical, with similar, unspecialized styles. Female sub- 

 genital plate valvular. Limbs with femora unarmed except as 

 follows: cephalic femora with ventro-cephalic margin supplied dis- 

 tad with minute, piliform but well separated spines, or lacking these, 

 with a single elongate heavy distal spine ; median and caudal femora 

 with a similar distal spine on both ventral margins. Tarsi pilose 

 ventrad, lacking pulvilli, caudal metatarsus as long as combined 

 length of succeeding joints. Tarsal claws delicate, symmetrical, 

 unspecialized; arolia absent. 



Oulopteryx dascilloides 27 new species. Plate XV, figures 5, 6. 



This species, though congeneric, differs in many respects from 

 0. meliponarum, with which it is compared on page 247. 



The blackish brown, usually coriaceous pronotum and tegmina 

 and general contour strongly resemble certain species of Coleoptera. 



Type: cf ; Pariacabo, French Guiana. [Paris Museum.] 



In addition to the characters given in the generic description, 

 we note the following. Size smaller, form not as elongate as in 

 meliponarum. Head somewhat shorter than in that species, very 

 slightly longer than broad. Interocular space three-quarters 

 width between antennal sockets. Maxillary palpi shorter than in 

 meliponarum. Pronotum smaller, discal boss stronger and giving 

 the pronotum a decidedly less flattened appearance. Tegmina 

 extending beyond cereal apices, decidedly coriaceous, sutural and 

 costal margins rather strongly oblique to rounded apex in distal 

 third. Wings with rolls of folded appendicular field lying obliquely. 

 Median segment rather strongly impressed meso-proximad, with 

 a short transverse ridge mesad on each side, the impressed area in- 

 vaded by a blunt angulation meso-caudad, with a heavy tuft of 

 agglutinated hairs springing from the depression in front of that 

 point, directed cephalad. Supra-anal plate with length approxi-

mately equal to one-third basal width, lateral margins weakly con- 

 cave and convergent to broadly rounded median portion, except 

 in a very small area mesad where a small rounded production oc- 

 curs, the surface of this concave, the entire distal margin well sup- 

 plied with elongate hairs. Concealed genitalia not visible in this 

 specimen. Subgenital plate nearly symmetrical, the lateral mar- 

 gins convergent, the sinistral very feebly convex, then as feebly 

 concave, the dextral as feebly concave to the style sockets, between 

 these the distal margin is roughly broadly convex, weakly oblique 

 in proximal portions, mesad truncate but when seen in caudal as- 

 pect as weakly obtuse-angulate ventrad, the angles formed all 

 rounded. Styles similar, simple, straight, cylindrical, rounded at 

 apex, each about two and one-half times as long as its width, 

 slightly over one-quarter as long as the distance between the style 

 bases. Limbs very slightly heavier and shorter than in meliponarum. 

 Cephalic femora with ventro-cephalic margin supplied distad with 

 a very few, minute, piliform spines, which are scarcely distinguish- 

 able, terminated by a single elongate distal spine. Caudal meta- 

 tarsus equal to combined length of the succeeding tarsal joints. 



General coloration shining blackish chestnut brown, paling to 

 hazel along costal margin. Tegmina, when held against light, chest- 

 nut brown paling to hazel along costal margin. Wings transparent, 

 almost colorless, veins buffy, costal veins distad opaque, ochraceous- 

 buff. Dorsal surface of mesonotum, metanotum and abdomen 

 buffy, the latter suffused with blackish chestnut brown laterad and 

 in broad distal portion. Head shining blackish chestnut brown, 28 

 mouthparts and limbs mars brown, coxae and abdomen, except 

 proximo-mesad where it is slightly paler, blackish chestnut brown.

This specimen is more intensively colored than the type. In this 

 genus, which includes a multitude of species, often very closely re- 

 lated, we believe the present association to be correct, though it 

 is impossible to be certain without males from the same locality. 



In the male type of lata, the head coloration is destroyed, traces of 

 a paler band between the eyes and a pair of dark flecks alone being 

 discernible. In the female at hand the head coloration is apparent- 

 ly as it would be in the type, had its coloration been retained. 

 Head with occiput ochraceous-tawny, terminating in a straight 

 line between the eyes, upon which are situated two slightly im- 

 pressed dots of dark brown, below this is a band of buff which widens 

 slightly laterad, in that portion having a larger impressed dot of 

 dark brown on each side, below this band the face is pale ochraceous- 

 tawny. 



Compared with C. panamae Hebard, this cephalic marking is seen 

 to differ principally in having the more widely separated pair of 

 dots, the larger and the pale areas confined to a transverse band in- 

 stead of spreading ventrad over the face.

very slightly smaller size, distinctive and unspotted cephalic mark- 

 ing, pronotum with disk proportionately smaller when compared 

 with the ample lateral portions and tegmina with venation broadly 

 pale in all portions, so that the small remaining darker areas give 

 these organs a delicately tessellate appearance. 



Type:<?; Bartica, British Guiana. April 14, 1913. (H. S. Parish.) 

 [Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., Type no. 537.] 



Size rather large for the genus, form depressed, in outline elongate 

 elliptico-ovoid. Head broad, decidedly depressed; from the dor- 

 sum practically the entire occiput and cephalic half of the eyes are 

 seen to be exposed, occipital outline truncate, the eyes almost im- 

 perceptibly projecting beyond the interocular area; interocular 

 space broad (.6 mm.), one and one-half times occipital ocular 

 depth, about four-fifths as wide as space between antennal sockets. 

 Maxillary palpi with third joint elongate and slender; fourth joint 

 three-quarters as long as third; fifth joint slightly longer than 

 fourth, moderately enlarged. Pronotum transverse elliptical, 

 with a marked rectangulate tendency, due to the wide and strongly 

 transverse cephalic and caudal margins, cephalic margin showing 

 a trace of convexity only above the head, caudal margin showing a 

 very feeble convexity, lateral margins broadly convex, rounding 

 evenly into cephalic and caudal margins; greatest width mesad; 

 disk with a shallow medio-longitudinal impression and a pair of 

 brief oblique sulci laterad, very slightly but appreciably smaller 

 in proportion to lateral portions than in lata; lateral portions 

 weakly declivent cephalad, where the surfaces are very shallowly 

 concave, weakly bossed over tegmina. Tegmina elongate, extend- 

 ing briefly beyond cereal bases, greatest width at proximal third, 

 thence narrowing evenly to near the sharply rounded but acute apex; 

 marginal field very broad; costal veins (17) with a number of false 

 veinlets between, discoidal sectors (16) strongly oblique. Wings 

 with intercalated triangle forming an angle of appreciably less than 

 ninety degrees. Sixth abdominal tergite with a very shallow 

 round depression mesad, rather thickly supplied with minute agglu- 

 tinated hairs. Supra-anal plate damaged in this specimen. Sub- 

 genital plate with flattened bases of the shallowly inset styles 

 occupying almost all of free margin; styles very elongate, nearly 

 three times as long as basal width, broad at base, tapering to the 

 lamellate and rather sharply rounded apices, unarmed on external 

 surfaces. Between the styles the median portion of the plate is 

 produced in a very slender, chitinous shaft, three-quarters as long 

 as one of the styles, showing a very slight and even curvature cau- 

 dad throughout its length and tapering to the aciculate apex. 

 Limbs and their armament, tarsi, claws, pulvilli and arolia as 

 characteristic of the genus.

 than wide, the two sharply rounded portions thus formed with sur- 

 faces moderately convex, lateral margins feebly concave. Sub- 

 genital plate ample, narrow distal portion reflexed, longitudinally 

 cleft mesad. 



Head with vertex to point of least width between eyes auburn, 

 the line of demarcation there sharp, weakly convex dorsad in 

 male, transverse in female, face whitish buffy shading to ochraceous- 

 buff ventrad. Antennae in males mummy brown in proximal 

 fourth, thence much paler, buckthorn brown, in female pale buck- 

 thorn brown throughout. Pronotum with marginal portions trans- 

 parent, very faintly tinged with ochraceous-buff ; disk tawny, mesad 

 with a pair of small, parallel, longitudinal markings of ochraceous- 

 buff. In the female the disk is russet laterad, the area between and 

 about these markings alone tawny. Tegmina transparent, marginal 

 field and along costal margin very faintly tinged with ochraceous- 

 buff, the veins and veinlets in the other portions (except the hum- 

 eral trunk for a brief distance proximad, where it is ochraceous- 

 tawny) all broadly defined in this color, the very small intervening 

 areas in these portions weakly tinged with ochraceous-tawny, this 

 giving the tegmina a delicately tessellate appearance. Wings 

 transparent very faintly tinged with buff, except in proximal por- 

 tion of costal veins (strongly tinged with prouts brown in this area 

 in the intensively colored allotype) and about the intercalated 

 triangle, where they are weakly tinged with ochraceous-tawny, the 

 enlarged (distal) portions of the costal veins whitish. Limbs och-

 whitish bloom.

 there this area of coloration is terminated by a very fine, transverse 

 line of mummy brown, below which the face is entirely pale och- 

 raceous-buff and likewise opaque, 33 antennae and mouthparts 

 weakly tinged with translucent ochraceous-buff. Pronotum with 

 marginal portions transparent, faintly tinged with ochraceous-buff; 

 disk ochraceous-tawny, in some examples paling mesad to och- 

 raceous-buff tinged with ochraceous-tawny, this more extensive 

 caudad. Tegmina transparent evenly and weakly tinged with 

 ochraceous-buff. Wings transparent, with a very faint buffy 

 tinge, this becoming stronger in the area of the costal veins and 

 showing a very weak tawny suffusion about the intercalated triangle. 

 Dorsal surface of abdomen ochraceous-buff, faintly tinged with 

 ochraceous-tawny. Limbs ochraceous-buff. Ventral surface pale 

 ochraceous-buff, in the best preserved specimens showing the same 

 opaque whitish condition as found on the face.

in large part from the vicinity of Rio de Janeiro, type locality of 

 many of the older species described from South America. 



As a result, the present study has aided greatly in clearing up the 

 identity of a number of older names. Several of these are of great 

 importance in that they represent genotypic species. Such are; 

 Neoblattella adspersicollis, Liosilpha pumicata, Phoraspis picta, 

 Petasodes mouffeti, Monastria biguttata, Brachycola tuberculata and 

 Parahormetica bilobata. 



The 155 specimens treated, represent 27 genera and 38 species, 

 of which 3 genera and 9 species are new. 



Among the new species described, Dasyblatta thaumasiahom~PeLr&, 

 and Oulopteryx meliponarum from near Passa-Quatro, Minas Geraes, 

 represent extremely unusual types. The latter species is of addi- 

 tional interest, in being the first Blattid known to be symbiotic 

 with bees.

Though in a poor state of preservation, the present specimen is 

 seen to agree closely with a male, previously recorded by Rehn, 

 from Para, Brazil. The squarely truncate tegminal maculation is 

 a striking feature of coloration in the species. Slightly darker 

 transverse suffusions across the face, suggested in these specimens, 

 may prove to be a more conspicuous feature of coloration in better 

 preserved material. Length of body 5.6, length of tegmen 5.3 mm.

This insect appears to be closely related to A . fusca Shelf ord, des- 

 cribed from a unique female from Cachabi, Ecuador. The present 

 male differs from the description of that species in the larger size, 

 pale head and pronotum and in features of wing venation. 



In the present specimen the interval between the discoidal vein 

 and its branch caudad 36 is wider and is crossed by three transverse 

 veinlets, this area being very weakly defined distad, the branching

 has referred.

of the axillary vein is regular, while the anal vein in the appendic- 

 ular field curves strongly toward the caudad margin distad. 



The male of fusca will probably show other differences of more 

 diagnostic value than those of the wing venation. 



Type: cf ; Rio Itaya, Peru. 37 February. [Paris Museum.] 



Size small for the genus of very small species, form relatively 

 moderately slender, coleopteroid. Head distinctly longer than 

 broad, with no distinct ridge above ocellar areas, ocellar spots 

 subobsolete 3i Pronotum almost perfectly oval, surface weakly 

 convex. Tegmina comparatively narrow, rather strongly chitinous, 

 venation inconspicuous, costal margin very feebly convex proxi- 

 mad, thence nearly straight to distal portion, where it is oblique 

 and more markedly convex to the acute-angulate though bluntly 

 rounded apex, this apex situated beyond the axis of the tegmen 

 toward the sutural margin. Wings very elongate and narrow, over 

 twice as long as greatest width, costal veins (five) straight and 

 scarcely thickened distad, medio-discoidal area with two transverse 

 veinlets, the more distal heavy and appearing as a gradual curvature 

 of the discoidal vein to join the median vein, this veinlet sending 

 three veinlets distad; appendicular field in length slightly over two- 

 fifths that of remaining portion of wing, length equal to width. 

 Supra-anal plate with free margin broadly convex, about twice as 

 wide as long; dorsal surface with a delicate transverse ridge mesad, 

 which bears mesad on its cephalic face a tuft of microscopic hairs, 

 cephalad of which it is concave, the caudal margin of the preceding 

 tergite being roundly emarginate about this concavity. Subgenital 

 plate simple, bearing two very minute, short, simple, conical styles.

Head light ochraceous-tawny, suffused with mummy brown 

 laterad above the clypeus, maxillary palpi dresden brown, with dis- 

 tal joints deepening to mummy brown. Antennae deep dresden 

 brown. Pronotum with disk immaculate light ochraceous-tawny, 

 lateral portions transparent, tinged with buff. Tegmina deep 

 chestnut brown, except the narrow marginal field, which is trans- 

 parent, tinged with buff. Wings tinged with mummy brown, this 

 weak proximad, very heavy in distal portion of anterior field and 

 anterior portion of radiate field. Ventral surface of abdomen 

 buffy brown mesad, shading to prouts brown laterad. Limbs and 

 cerci ochraceous-buff, the cephalic tibiae and tarsi weakly suffused 

 with brown.

The type of this handsome, though plainly bicolored species, is 



unique. 



DASYBLATTA 39 new genus 



This genus is erected to include two anomalous species, thaumasia, 

 described on page 225, and chopardi, described on page 257, appar- 

 ently referable to the Group Blattellae, but exceptionally distinc- 

 tive in being clothed with microscopic hairs and in having the in- 

 tercalated triangle curled and tubuliform when at rest. 40 



The insect further shows decided similarity to some of the smaller 

 species of the genus Ischnoptera, belonging to the Group Ischnop- 

 terae, in the general contour, and particularly that of the head and 

 pronotum. 



In linear position we place Dasyblatta after Platylestes and before 

 Chromatonolus, no close relationship to any previously described 

 genus, however, being indicated. 



Genotype. â€” Dasyblatta thaumasia new species. 



Generic Description. Based on the male sex. Size small, form 

 slender, structure not as delicate as is usual in the Group, entire 

 surface, when tegmina are closed, decidedly hairy. Interocular 

 space rather broad to decidedly narrow; ocelli distinct, with flat 

 surfaces of ocellar areas forming a rather sharp angle with the 

 interocellar space. Eyes extending ventrad nearly to maxillary palpi. 

 Maxillary palpi comparatively short, with fifth segment longest 

 of all. Pronotum moderately convex, laterad decidedly so to the 

 very narrowly concave lateral portions, disk with two broad but 

 distinct sulcations mesad, which converge caudad; cephalic margin 

 transverse, much broader caudal margin weakly convex, point of 

 greatest width meso-caudad. Tegmina and wings fully developed. 

 Tegmina hirsute, anal field very elongate, discoidal sectors longi- 

 tudinal. 41 Wing with costal veins not enlarged, discoidal and un- 

 branched median vein connected by numerous transverse veinlets; 

 ulnar vein with (1) complete branch, showing numerous transverse 

 veinlets and very numerous bases of these toward fold of the wing, 

 intercalated triangle very broad and conspicuous, curling in a tube 

 when the wings are at rest. Dorsal surface of abdomen unspecial- 

 ized. Subgenital plate with a process sinistro-proximad, which 

 lies outside of, and alongside, the cereal base. Limbs heavy for the 

 group. Ventro-cephalic margin of cephalic femora armed with a

40 In these features only, agreement with the genus Oulopteryx, described in 

 the present paper and assigned to the Corydiinae, is shown. The ensemble of 

 characters, however, leads us to believe that the present genus is a member of 

 the Pseudomopinae. 



41 In the specimen described as D. chopardi on page 257, the discoidal sectors of 

 the dextral tegmen toward the sutural margin are, however, moderately oblique.

few well-spaced, heavy spines, succeeded by a row of (15-17) 

 minute chaetiform spines, terminating in three heavy spines, very 

 elongate, in increasing ratio distad. Ventro-caudal margin of 

 cephalic femora armed with (1 median, 1 subdistal and 1 distal) 

 heavy, elongate spines. Other femoral margins well supplied with 

 heavy elongate spines. Four proximal tarsal joints supplied distad 

 with minute, simple pulvilli. Tarsal claws simple, symmetrical. 

 Very small arolia present.

Type: cf ; Para, Para, Brazil. (C. F. Baker.) [Acad. Nat. Sci. 

 Phila., Type no. 5377.] 



In addition to the characters given in the generic description, the 

 following are noteworthy. Interocular space slightly over one- 

 quarter occipital ocular depth, about one-third width between 

 antennal sockets; impressed punctae, the sockets of hairs, particul- 

 arly conspicuous in the inter-ocular-ocellar area. Third joint of 

 maxillary palpi slightly shorter than the large fifth joint, slightly 

 longer than the fourth joint. The hirsute tegmina have, to the 

 naked eye, a coriaceous appearance, due to the fact that the hairs 

 are not visible except under the microscope; area of dextral tegmen, 

 concealed when at rest, without hairs; discoidal sectors (8 and 9) 

 longitudinal. Wings with distal portion of anterior margin hirsute. 

 Metanotum with a minute subchitinous projection mesad on the 

 caudal margin, which is twice as long as broad; large and very de- 

 cided rounded ridges diverge from this across the median segment, 

 terminating before the latero-caudal portions of that segment. 

 Seven proximal tergites with latero-caudal angles rectangulate 

 and sharply rounded. Eighth tergite narrowly visible, normal 

 dextrad but with sinistral folded portion (including the latero- 

 caudal angle) strongly produced beside the super-anal plate to near 

 the cereal base. Supra-anal plate two-thirds as long as proximal 

 width, weakly chitinous in distal portion; lateral margins straight, 

 parallel, to bases of cerci, straight and strongly oblique to within 

 these, the remaining portion roundly produced, showing a weak indi- 

 cation of a symmetrical, trapezoidal contour. Springing from the sin- 

 istral base of the subgenital plate and from within the production 

 of the eighth tergite, a straight, cylindrical, chitinous process ex- 

 tends caudad along the outer margin of the cercus nearly as far as 

 does the supra-anal plate, this process six times as long as thick, 

 with apex moderately enlarged and bearing a cluster of elongate, 

 straight, chaetiform spines. Subgenital plate with all but base 

 of sinistral portion curled upward to just within and beneath sinis- 

 tral cercus, bearing on its internal surface a stout conical project- 

 ion which terminates in several adjacent, very elongate chaetiform 

 spines, directed mesad, the margin of this portion weakly curved, 




226 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART II 



rounding at its extremity, then declivent to the not upcurled median 

 portion of the plate, the median section of the margin undulate, 

 bearing in its median depression a small, cylindrical process (sinis- 

 tral style) slightly longer than wide, directed dorsad and armed 

 with two sharp, slender spines, which curve weakly sinistrad; bear- 

 ing in its dextral depression a much more elongate process (dextral 

 style) which is sinuous, directed dorso-mesad and terminating in 

 a sharp, slender spine; beyond the dextral, portion of the plate is 

 strongly curled upward and inward, overhanging the dextral style 

 and folded beneath the cereal base, its margin broadly convex. 



Head with occiput to above ocelli auburn, ocelli light buff; re- 

 maining portions, including proximal antennal joints and palpi, 

 ochraceous-buff with a tawny tinge, with twin weak suffusions of 

 auburn between the antennal sockets. Remaining portions of 

 antennae dresden brown. Pronotum cinnamon brown with a very 

 faintly paler, subobsolete medio-longitudinal line and flecks, lateral 

 portions very narrowly ochraceous-buff with a tinge of buckthorn 

 brown. Tegmina translucent buckthorn brown, very brief mar- 

 ginal field ochraceous-buff with a tinge of buckthorn brown, humeral 

 trunk and between humeral and very brief mediastine vein, cin- 

 namon-brown for a very short distance. Wings transparent, 

 faintly tinged with brown, except in area of costal veins, where they 

 are heavily tinged with dresden brown. Dorsal surface of abdo- 

 men buckthorn brown, mottled with cinnamon brown. Limbs 

 pale orange-yellow, ventral surface of abdomen ochraceous-buff 

 tinged with orange. 



Length of body 10.8, length of pronotum 2.7, width of pronotum 

 3.3, length of tegmen 10.9, width of tegmen 3.3, length of caudal 

 tibia 4.2, length of caudal metatarsus 1.9 mm. 



This diminutive and commonplace looking insect is one of the 

 most highly specialized and distinctive forms of the Blattidae 

 known to us. The type is unique.

Neoblattella janeirae new species. Plate IX, figures 17, 18 and 19. 



Though showing the general structure and color pattern of sev- 

 eral of the larger groups of this genus, this species differs from all 

 others known to us in the armament of the cephalic femora. The 

 ventro-cephalic margin of these members is armed with a row of 

 heavy spines which decrease suddenly in size and length mesad, those 

 distad being very minute and closely placed, but too heavy to be 

 termed piliform. This is seen to agree more closely with the type 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 227 



termed "A," than with type "B," the latter the characteristic 

 armament for the other species of Neoblattella. 



We do not feel warranted in considering this species generically 

 distinct solely on this condition; in numerous other characters 

 janeirae shows much closer affinity to the Conspersa Group than 

 to the genotypic Adspersicollis and other Groups of the genus. 



The very narrow interocular space and symmetrically highly 

 specialized male subgenital plate constitute particularly distinctive 

 features. The proportionately decided amplitude of the organs 

 of flight is only exceeded in males of N. carrikeri Hebard, of the 

 species at hand. 



Though simply and not strikingly colored, this is one of the most 

 interesting species of the genus, due to the unusual armament of 

 the cephalic femora and remarkable specialization of the male 

 supra-anal plate. 



Type: d"; Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Elevation 500 to 1000 

 meters. May. [Paris Museum.] 



Size medium for the genus, form moderately slender. Inter- 

 ocular space comparatively narrow, one-third that between the 

 antennal sockets. Ocellar spots distinct, their surfaces oblique 

 to, but rounding smoothly into, the flattened inter-ocular-ocellar 

 area. Maxillary palpi elongate. Pronotum with surface very 

 weakly convex, greatest width distinctly caudad of median point, 

 caudal margin showing an exceedingly broad and rounded, feeble 

 obtuse-angulate production. Tegmina delicate and elongate with 

 (10 sinistral, 11 dextral) longitudinal discoidal sectors; cross-veinlets 

 distinct, particularly in distal portion, where they are darkened. 

 Wings with mediastine vein and (7) proximal costal veins showing 

 elongate thickened distal portions, ulnar vein with (6) 42 complete 

 branches, intercalated triangle well developed, its width over one- 

 half its length. Dorsal surface of abdomen without distinct 

 specialization, but with meso-caudal section of sixth tergite sub- 

 chitinous in an irregularly triangular area, extending over half 

 the distance to base of the tergite, the sides of which area are con- 

 cave. Supra-anal plate two-fifths as long as basal width, very 

 bluntly triangularly produced, with apex broadly sub-bilobate and 

 lateral margins showing very broad and feeble concavity opposite 

 the cereal bases. Concealed genitalia hidden. Subgenital plate 

 ample, symmetrical, very deeply cleft on each side, the lateral por- 

 tions thus separated, nearly vertical, elongate and very slenderly 

 triangular plates curling outward to their blunt, rounded apices, 

 which extend slightly further caudad than the median production

of the plate; that portion weakly chitinous, roundly produced, 

 leaving a very deep, narrow cleft on each side between it and the 

 lateral portions, snowing a blunt but decided medio-longitudinal 

 carina extending to its small apical portion, which portion is sud- 

 denly directed cephalad, its surface flat, its lateral margins cutting 

 in at the base so that, with the lateral margins of the basal portion, 

 very small but moderately deep concavities are formed. From the 

 bases of the very deep lateral clefts of the subgenital plate spring 

 similar, simple, elongate, straight and nearly cylindrical styles, 

 which, lying in these clefts between the median portion and the 

 lateral portions, extend half the distance to the apices of the lateral 

 portions of the plate, each about five times as long as its proximal 

 width. Cephalic femora with ventro-cephalic margin armed with 

 (4) large, elongate, moderately heavy, well-spaced spines, succeeded 

 by a row of (18) very minute but moderately stout spinulae, ter- 

 minated by three 43 large, moderately heavy spines, elongate in in- 

 creasing ratio distad; ventro-caudal margin armed with (3 and 1 

 distal) spines. Other femoral margins armed with spines, as 

 characteristic of the genus. Caudal metatarsus very elongate and 

 slender, nearly twice as long as the combined length of the succeed- 

 ing tarsal joints. Pulvilli on four proximal tarsal joints small, acute- 

 angulate produced. Tarsal claws symmetrical, the moderately 

 well-developed flange margined with very minute teeth. Arolia 

 between the tarsal claws moderately-well developed. 



General coloration buckthorn brown. Head with occiput 

 ochraceous-buff , with suffused vertical streaks of prouts brown; a 

 broad band of prouts brown between the eyes;ocelli and inter-ocular- 

 ocellar area ochraceous-buff, this extending over face, but weaker 

 and more embrowned ventrad, a small fleck of prouts brown below 

 each ocellar spot, four similar flecks below which are placed in a 

 transverse line showing convexity ventrad, area below antennal 

 sockets suffused with prouts brown, with a fleck of prouts brown 

 on each side meso-ventrad. Antennae clay color. Pronotum 

 transparent, faintly tinged with brown laterad; disk ochraceous- 

 buff, heavily though finely pictured with lines and dots of prouts 

 brown. Tegmina transparent, faintly tinged with brown, except 

 distad and in area of dextral tegmen concealed when at rest where 

 the tinge is darker, mummy brown, this very heavy and blackish 



43 A correction for this character for Neoblattella, as given by us in our key, is 

 necessary, (Mem. Am. Ent. Soc, No. 4, p. 28, (1921).). We find that three 

 heavier distal spines occur in all of the species of the genus before us excepting 

 eudromielloides, berlandi and the numerous species of the Impar Group, in which 

 but two heavier distal spines are shown. In some species virtually an inter- 

 mediate condition is reached, the first of the three distal spines being sufficiently 

 reduced so that it would be counted by some and regarded as one of the series of 

 smaller spines by others. Of the Group Blattellae, Neoblattella is much the larg- 

 est American genus and it is to be expected that much more decided differences 

 will be found between some of its component groups and species than occur 

 in any of the related genera. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 229 



in the inner portion of the area concealed when at rest, the distal 

 veins and veinlets more strongly defined in mummy brown. Wings 

 transparent, faintly tinged with mummy brown, this heavier distad 

 and in area of costal veins ; clubbed portions of costal veins opaque, 

 mummy brown. Mesonotum and metanotum prouts brown with 

 a medio-longitudinal line of whitish, which on each segment expands 

 caudad. Dorsal surface of abdomen clear cinnamon-buff, each seg- 

 ment very heavily suffused with mummy brown lateral. Underparts 

 clear cinnamon-buff, suffused with prouts brown laterad; abdomen 

 with flecks of this color laterad and with a medio-longitudinal suf- 

 fusion of blackish brown, which expands caudad to include the 

 entire subgenital plate. 



Length of body 13.8, length of pronotum 3.3, width of pronotum 

 4.8, length of tegmen 16.2, width of tegmen 4.9, length of wing 14.8, 

 width of wing 8.7, width of intercalated triangle 1.8, length of

The type of this remarkable species is unique. 



Neoblattella platystylata new species. Plate IX, figures 21, 22 and 23; Plate X, figure 1. 



Closely related to N. conspersa (Brunner), the present species 

 agrees in general structure, minute and scattered tegminal dots and 

 general character of specialization of the subgenital plate in both 

 sexes, (figured for conspersa, plate IX, figure 20). 



The styles of the male subgenital plate are much heavier, decid- 

 edly broader than long, while the production of the meso-caudal 

 portion of that plate is much more sudden and pronounced, form- 

 ing there a stout projection. 



The female subgenital plate is specialized very much as described 

 for conspersa on page 261; the inner projections, however, usually 

 produced in but one or two stout spines. 



Though the dark marking of the ventral surface of the abdomen 

 is carried out broadly to the extremity of the subgenital plate in 

 all of the males, the majority of the females have this marking 

 narrower and in individuals of extreme recessive coloration it is 

 greatly reduced, not reaching as far as the base of the subgenital 

 plate. 



As in conspersa, the number and intensity of the dark scattered 

 tegminal dots is individually variable, as is the usually conspicuous 

 pale band below the dark interocular band on the head.

terocular space wide, slightly narrower than that between the 

 antennal sockets. Ocellar spots distinct. Maxillary palpi elong- 

 ate, fourth joint four-fifths as long as third, fifth very slightly shorter 

 than fourth. Pronotum with surface very weakly convex, greatest 

 width slightly caudad of mesal point. Tegmina very delicate, 

 with (9) longitudinal discoidal sectors, veins with scattered dark 

 dots, representing the bases of microscopic hairs; cross-veinlets 

 moderately developed, moderately darkened in distal portions. 

 Wings with costal veins heavily clubbed distad, ulnar vein with 

 (3) complete branches, intercalated triangle small. Abdomen with 

 dorsal surface unspecialized. Supra-anal plate weakly triangularly 

 produced, about one-third as long as proximal width with apex 

 broadly rounded. Concealed genitalia including a process ter- 

 minating in a broad whorl, its surface covered with very closely 

 placed, minute spines. 44 Subgenital plate convex and curled dorsad 

 on each side, but broadly and shallowly concave in large median 

 portion, distal margin approximately transverse, on each side pro- 

 duced in short, very broad, styles which fuse with the plate at their 

 bases; between these the plate is produced mesad a nearly equal 

 distance, the sides of this portion slanting upward and the free mar- 

 gins concave oblique to the apex; due to the contour of this pro- 

 duction, its apex appears truncate in ventral aspect, but V-emargin- 

 ate in caudal aspect. Each of the styles is nearly twice as broad as 

 its greatest length, the greatest length being on the internal margin, 

 the roundly truncate, broad apex being in consequence oblique 

 to the caudal margin of the subgenital plate. The apices of these 

 styles are moderately thickly supplied with minute but stout spines, 

 directed caudad and curving ventrad. Limbs, their armament, 

 pulvilli,arolia and tarsal claws as characteristic of the genus. The 

 first three of the five or six microscopic teeth on the margin of the 

 flange of the tarsal claws are relatively decided. 



Allotype: 9 ; same date as type. [Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila.] 

 Agrees closely with male in size and development of organs of 

 flight, differing as follows. Supra-anal plate with free margin more 

 convex and roundly notched at the apex. Subgenital plate short, 

 scoop-shaped, bearing on each side just within the cerci a small 

 lamellate projection, with truncate apex armed with (5 to 7 in the 

 series) closely placed, chitinous spines, resembling the teeth of a 

 comb; within at the base of this process is another projection 45 the 



44 The concealed genitalia in the species of this group appear to be very delicate. 

 In the great majority of specimens before us these parts are mashed, and in none 

 do they appear to have dried in a normal position. 



45 The series shows that these processes are variable in contour, as well as 

 occasionally having more teeth and in themselves a very weak character to sep- 

 arate this sex of platystylala from the very similar females of conspersa. An 

 average lesser number of teeth on the inner processes of females of platystylata 

 from Para has appeared to us to be a guide to distinguish them from females of 

 conspersa from that locality. It is evident that females of the species of the pre- 

 sent Group will be found as difficult to separate as those of the Impar Group of 

 the genus; determination of female material, without males from the same local- 

 ity, being often out of the question.

 the body length of the material preserved.

 the interocellar pale band is always conspicuous except in discolored specimens.

This handsome little insect is closely related to N. berlandi, des- 

 cribed on page 234, differing in the smaller size, paler head, broader 

 interocular space, pronotum with medio-longitudinal portion nearly 

 immaculate, tegmina with proximal portion of anal sulcus as heavily 

 suffused as costal marginal area toward the discoidal vein and male 

 subgenital plate which, though similar in type of specialization, 

 differs strikingly in the deep concavity of the lateral margins and much 

 smaller cucullate areas protecting the spines which replace the 

 usual cylindrical styles. 



These species, with N. fasciata (Brunner), from a group which we 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 233 



designate as the Berlandi Group, distinguished by their compara- 

 tively graceful structure and strikingly bicolored tegmina. 47 



The superficial resemblance of this insect to Eudromiella bicolorata 

 Hebard is striking; closer examination, however, showing the great 

 differences between these species. 



Type: cf; Passa-Quatro, Rio Las Piedras, MinasGeraes, Brazil. 

 Elevation 1000 meters. [Paris Museum.] 



Size small and form slender for the genus. Eyes large, inter- 

 ocular space nearly two-thirds that between the antennal sockets. 

 Ocellar spots not large but distinct, these and the maxillary palpi 

 much as in berlandi. Pronotum much as in that species, but show- 

 ing latero-cephalic as well as weaker latero-caudal shallow depres- 

 sions. Tegmina and wings fully developed, extending well beyond 

 cereal apices. Tegmina with (6 and 7) longitudinal discoidal 

 sectors. Wings with clubbed apices of costal veins elongate and 

 heavy, ulnar vein with (5) complete branches, intercalated triangle 

 distinct, width one-half length. Dorsal surface of abdomen un- 

 specialized, latero-caudal angles very bluntly rounded. Supra- 

 anal plate transverse, one-third as long as proximal width, feebly 

 obtuse-angulate produced, but with apex moderately bilobate. 

 Subgenital plate nearly symmetrical; 48 lateral portions briefly 

 produced, with straight margins, then suddenly emarginate for 

 an equal distance, forming a projection which is less than rectangul- 

 ate sinistrad, rectangulate dextrad; from these points the plate 

 is again produced and shallowly curled upward, the margins 

 hardly convergent, feebly concave to the broad, transverse apex, 

 the lateral emarginations thus formed being nearly rectangulate 

 and feebly rounded. The lateral portions are thickened and more 

 strongly curled at the latero-caudal angles, thus forming a minute 

 rounded cone, the open base of which is caudad and from within 

 which, springing from its base, on each side, project caudad two 

 minute, strongly curved spines, the apices of which reach the caudal 

 margin. Limb armament, pulvilli, arolia and tarsal claws as given 

 for berlandi. 



Surface shining. Head clay color, the vertex approaching cin- 

 namon-buff, with a very broad interocular band of bister, ocelli 

 buffy, below are three broken bands of bister on the face; the first 

 two each formed by two transverse suffusions which are connected 

 laterad along the antennal sockets, the third formed by four suf- 

 fusions arranged in a line which is strongly convex ventrad. Pro- 

 notum translucent, tinged with cinnamon-buff laterad, with two 

 broad blackish prouts brown longitudinal bands which are separ- 



47 From the description of Phyllodromia minor Brunner, it appears probable 

 that that species is either a member of the present group, or of the genus Eudromi- 

 ella.

 ately caudad ; median area between these ochraceous-buff with two 

 microscopic flecks of prouts brown caudad. Tegmina translucent, 

 tinged with cinnamon-buff in proximal portions and just beyond 

 discoidal vein in entire costal marginal area, from there to dis- 

 coidal vein suffused with mummy brown, anal sulcus also broadly 

 suffused with mummy brown, this narrowing and becoming sub- 

 obsolete distad, discoidal field weakly tinged with dresden brown 

 in all but proximal portion. Wings transparent, moderately 

 heavily tinged with mummy brown; the narrow area of the en- 

 larged portions of the costal veins, which is broader than in berlandi, 

 light ochraceous-buff. Dorsal surface of abdomen ochraceous- 

 buff, with a weak mottled suffusion of prouts brown. Cerci light 

 ochraceous-buff, the distal joints flecked with black. Ventral 

 surface and limbs light ochraceous-buff, the abdomen with weak 

 brownish suffusions and an impressed fleck of prouts brown laterad 

 on each of the larger segments. Limbs flecked with prouts brown 

 at the bases of the spines, these flecks heavy on the tibiae.

Nearest relationship is with eudromielloides, under which species 

 the two are compared. 



Type : c? ; Upper basin of Amazon River, on frontier between Peru 

 and Bolivia. 49 (From Captain Mailles.) [Paris Museum.] 



Size medium small and form slender for the genus. Eyes promi- 

 nent, interocular space slightly more than half width between 

 antennal sockets, ocellar spots weakly indicated but flattened sur- 

 faces of these areas oblique, rounding into the intervening flattened 

 area; lateral margins of face subparallel to clypeal suture. Max- 

 illary palpi very slender and elongate, the fourth joint gradually 

 widening distad, fifth joint three-fifths as long as fourth. Pro- 

 notum moderately convex to lateral portions, showing a pair of 

 shallow but distinct latero-caudal depressions, caudal margin 

 very broadly convex, showing a very feeble tendency toward 

 an obtuse-angulation. Tegmina and wings fully developed, ex- 

 tending well beyond cereal apices. Tegmina with (9) longitudi- 

 nal discoidal sectors. Wings with clubbed distal portions of (13) 

 costal veins elongate and heavy; discoidal vein with (6) complete 

 branches; intercalated triangle distinct, width equal to one-half

 angles very bluntly rounded. Supra-anal plate simple, transverse, 

 curled ventrad, about half as long as width between cerci, free mar- 

 gin concave about cerci, broadly convex in portion between these. 

 Subgenital plate symmetrical, lateral margins broadly convex and 

 forming a weakly defined obtuse-angulation beneath cerci, con- 

 vergent one-quarter the distance between the cerci on each side, 

 there sharply but briefly emarginate and at these points curled in- 

 ward, forming a short cone, the open base of which is caudad and 

 within which, springing from the extremities of the median sec- 

 tion of the caudal margin, project caudad on each side, two minute, 

 slightly curved spines; median section of caudal margin transverse, 

 subchitinous. Ventro-cephalic margin of cephalic femora armed 

 with a row of spines which decrease gradually in size distad, ter- 

 minating in two elongate spines, of which the more distal is the 

 longer. Limb armament, pul villi, tarsal claws and arolia as char- 

 acteristic of the genus. Teeth of flange on tarsal claws well de- 

 veloped, the last tooth half as large as the point of the claw. 



Surface shining. Head with vertex blackish brown to ocellar 

 areas, there with a broad transverse band of ochraceous-buff, mar- 

 gined ventrad by a band of blackish brown which is nearly as broad, 

 eyes hazel, antennae and remaining portions of face translucent 

 clay color, the latter with two interrupted bands of blackish brown. 

 Pronotum translucent, tinged with cinnamon-buff laterad, with 

 two broad blackish longitudinal bands which fuse at the cephalic 

 margin and diverge caudad, area between these clay color, with a 

 longitudinal heavily suffused streak and two lateral dots of blackish 

 brown and a dot of cinnamon-buff cephalad. Tegmina translucent, 

 tinged with cinnamon-buff proximad in anal field and beyond to 

 first branch of median vein and also from just beyond discoidal 

 vein in entire costal marginal area, from there to discoidal vein 

 suffused with mummy brown and in entire discoidal field suffused 

 with dresden brown as is the anal sulcus. Wings transparent, 

 rather heavily tinged with mummy brown, the narrow area of the 

 enlarged portion of the costal veins light ochraceous-buff. Dorsal

236 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART II 



This genus, erected to include Blatta pumicata Stal, adspersi- 

 collis Stal 50 and dilatata Saussure, 61 was restricted to the first species 

 by Kirby 's genotypic designation in 1904 52 and briefly diagnosed by 

 Shelf ord in 191 1 63 . 



A specimen of the genotype now before us, enables us to place the 

 genus definitely as an aberrant member of the Group Blattellae, 

 its broad form and moderately, reduced organs of flight giving a 

 rather close general resemblance to the actually very widely separ- 

 ated Old World genus Allacta. 6 * 



We find Liosilpha to be a distinctive genus, showing no close re- 

 lationships, but best placed on linear arrangement after Blattella 

 Caudell. In heaviness of limb armament, convergence toward 

 the normal in the Blattinae is shown, but the ensemble of characters 

 clearly demonstrates the proper assignment to be that indicated 

 above. 



The following generic characters are shown by the female before 

 us. Size medium large for the group, form very broad, structure 

 not as delicate as is usual in the group. Interocular space broad 

 (slightly narrower than that between the antennal sockets), ocellar 

 spots ample but weakly defined. Lateral margins of cheeks weakly 

 convergent ventrad. Maxillary palpi moderately elongate, (fourth 

 joint intermediate in length between third and fifth, the latter 

 with greatest width mesad). Pronotum broad, weakly convex, 

 becoming decidedly convex laterad, caudal margin broadly truncate. 

 Tegmina showing some reduction (extending nearly to the cereal 

 apices in the specimen at hand), moderately corneous, except in 

 area, of dextral tegmen concealed when at rest, with veins not dis- 

 tinguishable unless held up to the light, anal sulcus finely impressed, 

 delimiting the elongate-pyriform anal field, discoidal sectors (6 to 

 8) longitudinal. 55 Wings showing moderate reduction, the vena- 

 tion slightly irregular, (8) costal veins weakly clubbed, median 

 vein (once or twice) forked, ulnar vein with (2 56 ) complete branches, 

 intercalated triangle very weakly developed. Supra-anal plate 

 with apex rather deeply V-emarginate. Subgenital plate simple, 

 short. Cephalic femora with ventro-cephalic margin armed with 



60 Genotype of Neoblatiella.

63 Ent. Mo. Mag., (2), XXII, p. 156. 



54 Our statement in 1907, that we did not believe this species to be a member 

 of this group, was due to the fact that, without material for study, the characters 

 as far as described seemed to indicate other association. 



55 We are at a loss to explain Shelf ord 's characterization of these veins as 

 oblique. He apparently had material of pumicata before him, as his comments 

 on the genus agree in all other respects.

 (3 and 1 distal) heavy, elongate spines. Other femora with ventral 

 margins armed with numerous heavy, elongate spines, and with 

 very elongate genicular spines. Four proximal tarsal joints sup- 

 plied with large pulvilli. Large arolia present between the simple, 

 very weakly asymmetrical tarsal claws,

This specimen has the dorsal surface shining, clay color, except 

 for the lateral portions of the pronotum and marginal fields of the 

 tegmina, which are transparent, tinged with cinnamon-buff. The 

 dorsal surface of the abdomen is suffused with bister laterad and 

 distad, leaving the lateral margins of the wider tergites cinnamon- 

 buff. The cerci and limbs are cinnamon-buff, the latter with very 

 small flecks of brown at the spine bases. The ventral surface of 

 the abdomen is more narrowly suffused with bister laterad, with a 

 large pale marginal spot on each sternite, the subgenital plate bis- 

 ter proximo-laterad and opposite the cerci, these latter suffusions 

 extending mesad and connecting, but very weak in median portion.

 5.7, length of tegmen 10.8, width of tegmen 4, length of caudal femur

LITOBLATTA new genus. 



This genus is erected to include the single species, "Ischnoptera" 

 brasiliensis of Brunner. 



The males differ from those of Ischnoptera in being of a more de- 

 licate structure, wings with area between discoidal vein and anterior 

 margin broader, unspecialized dorsal surface of abdomen, transverse 

 supra-anal plate and cephalic femora with spines not distinctly 

 biseriate. 



Females differ in having lobiform, lateral tegmina, sixth tergite 

 bluntly triangularly produced over the similarly produced supra- 

 anal plate and almost completely concealing the latter and cephalic 

 femora with spines even less appreciably biseriate than in males. 



The production caudad of a tergite, which almost entirely con- 

 ceals the supra-anal plate in the female sex, is a feature unknown 

 to us for any other species of the American Pseudomopinae. 



In linear arrangement we place this genus before Symploce Hebard, 




238 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART II 



as the first of the known genera of the Ischnopterae having the 

 cephalic femoral spine armament of the uniseriate type. 



Generic Description. Structure of males very delicate, of females 

 strongly chitinous. Head elongate, ocelli distinct; flat surfaces of 

 ocellar areas forming a rather sharp angle with the interocellar space 

 in males, this area much reduced and less distinctly defined in fe- 

 males. Pronotum of male moderatly convex, with oblique sulci 

 present and caudal margin very weakly and broadly convex; of 

 female more decidedly and evenly convex, with caudal margin 

 truncate and showing scarcely any convexity. Tegmina of male 

 fully developed, with discoidal sectors weakly radiating; of female 

 represented by coriaceous lateral pads. Wings of male with area 

 between discoidal vein and anterior margin moderately broad; 

 mediastine vein extending more than half the distance to apex of 

 wing, from which spring a number of the costal veins, none of the 

 costal veins enlarged distad; discoidal vein branching, the forks 

 dividing toward apex of wing; ulnar vein almost straight, with in- 

 complete and complete branches; intercalated triangle small and 

 inconspicuous. Wings absent in female. Dorsal surface of male 

 abdomen unspecialized. Supra-anal plate of male transverse. Fe- 

 male with sixth tergite (PI. X, fig. 17A) bluntly triangularly pro- 

 oduced over the similarly produced supra-anal plate (PL X, fig. 

 17B) and almost completeley concaling the latter. Cephalic femora 

 with ventro-cephalic margin armed with heavy elongate spines, 

 which decrease strongly but irregularly in size distad," terminating 

 in three heavy and elongate spines, elongate in increasing ratio dis- 

 tad. Very small distal pulvilli present on four proximal tarsal joints 

 in males, absent in females. Small arolia present between the elon- 

 gate, slender, simple, symmetrical tarsal claws.

The description shows that Giglio-Tos failed to associate the sexes 

 of brasiliensis, erecting the synonymous Loboptera laurenziana, 

 based on the female sex of the species. 



87 In males of brasiliensis this series may be called uniseriate only because the 

 transition from the heavy elongate proximal spines to the small, but not piliform, 

 distal spines is irregular and not abrupt. In some males a number of the more 

 distal spines, being smallest and of subequal size, might lead one to term the spine 

 armament of this margin biseriate. 



In the females the decrease averages less but shows similar individual varia- 

 bility.

 shorter tegminal bands. 



Type: cf ; State of Santa Catharina, Brazil. [Hebard Collection,

Size smaller and form slightly more slender than in picta. In 

 other respects agreeing closely with that insect, except that the vin- 

 aceous-rufous lateral band on each of the tegmina is, both dorsal and 

 ventrad, much shorter, being abruptly terminated distinctly before 

 the median portion of the tegmen, while in picta it extends consid- 

 erably caudad of that point and narrows more gradually to its apex. 



Allotype: 9 ; Morretes, Parana, Brazil. [Paris Museum.] 



Agrees closely with the male sex, except in its somewhat larger

This is the first specimen of this magnificent cockroach, largest

Length of body 38, length of pronotum 8.3, width of pronotum 

 12.7, length of tegmen 51.2, width of tegmen 15 mm. 



The limb armament, tarsi, pulvilli and tarsal claws are similar 

 to those of the species of Epilampra here recorded, except that the 

 large spines are so large that their margins can be seen to be strongly, 

 though microscopically, serrulate, while the three tarsal joints after 

 the metatarsus all have minute spines bordering the large pulvilli 

 laterad, these briefly continued proximad in the proximal section 

 of the second joint, the ventral surface of which is not fully occupied 

 by the pulvillus. 



The form of the pronotum, strongly convex above the head and 

 flat in the produced meso-caudal portion, is very different from that 

 of any of the species assigned to Epilampra, while the apices of the 

 tegmina are on the median line and rather sharply rounded.

We agree with Brunner in considering Saussure 's P. glauca, des- 

 cribed from Brazil, a synonym of this species. 



Of the green and plainly colored species of this genus, prasina 

 attains the largest size, apparently usually exceeding even the larg- 

 est individuals of P. exoleta Burmeister. The measurements for 

 the present specimen are: length of body 25, interocular width .7, 

 length of pronotum 7.7, width of pronotum 9.5, length of tegmen 

 27.2, width of tegmen 9.2 mm.

This species has been synonymized under T. spectrum (Eschscholtz) . 

 We find that the tegmina and wings scarcely surpass the apex of 

 the abdomen in the female here recorded, as so splendidly figured 

 by Guerin and Percheron, and described by Serville. 60 In addition, 

 the reflexed proximal portion of the tegminal marginal field is dis- 

 tinctly lower than wide, with a weak emargination of the costal mar- 

 gin at its base. As a result, the name conspersum is restored. This 

 condition may be found to represent a geographic race of spectrum, 

 but at present insufficient material is at hand to determine whether 

 or not that is true. 



The measurements of the present female are; length of body 22.1,

At first glance, this specimen would appear to be solidly blackish 

 chestnut-brown in general coloration, except for the transparent 

 portion of the pronotum cephalad, which is tinged with warm buff. 

 On closer examination, however, the pronotum is seen to have 

 patches of very slightly paler color mesad and latero-caudad, show- 

 ing a rich deep mahogany red tinge, the marginal and anal fields 

 of the tegmina very faintly tinged with this color. 



60 Recorded by that author and later by Guerin, from Cuba, almost certainly 

 in error. The material recorded as this species by Burmeister, Saussure and 

 Brunner represents instead the closely related spectrum. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 243 



The present specimen is apparently somewhat larger than the 

 individual originally described; length of body 17, length of prono- 

 tum 4.6, width of pronotum 6.7, length of tegmen 16, width of teg- 

 men 5.6 mm. 



The genus Tribonidium includes species with pronotum impresso- 

 punctate and cephalic margin convex, as in Zetobora. The prono- 

 tum is, however, not broadly though conspicuously reflexed toward 

 the cephalic margin, agreeing in this respect with Phortioeca instead. 

 The species are of small size compared with those of the allied genera 

 and in the present species the pronotal magnitude is comparatively 

 very small. 



Tribonidium amplum new species. Plate XII, figures 9 and 10. 



This insect is evidently closely related to T. transversum (Brun- 

 ner), 61 differing in the larger size, more ample pronotum and tegmina 

 and. wings, which in the male sex, show no reduction whatever. 



Compared with the male of T. signaticollis (Burmeister) recorded 

 above, the present males are seen to differ in the conspicuously 

 broader pronotum, with impressed punctae smaller and nearly ab- 

 sent in the cucullate portion, scattered and minute caudad of that 

 area, entire cucullate and discal portions of pronotum appreciably 

 flattened and more ample organs of flight. 



Type: cf; Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. [Paris Museum.] 



Size large, form moderately broad, for this genus of small and 

 moderately broad, though graceful, species. Head flat, interocular 

 space broad, slightly over half as broad as that between the antennal 

 sockets, interocellar area shallowly concave; ocelli large, their sur- 

 faces at a decidedly obtuse angle to the interocellar area. Maxil- 

 lary palpi very short, third joint subequal in length to the enlarged 

 fifth joint, fourth joint three-fifths as long, expanding strongly dis- 

 tad. Pronotum ample; cephalic margin broadly convex to the 

 rounded lateral angles, weakly reflexed in lateral portions; lateral 

 angles situated slightly caudad of median point, latero-caudal mar- 

 gins to shoulders of equal obliquity and convexity to lateral portions 

 of cephalic margin, caudal margin between humeral shoulders trans- 

 verse, with median angulation feebly suggested Pronotum cucul- 

 late above head, this and the area caudad to the shoulders raised 



61 It appears doubtful from the literature that Saussure's assignment of trans- 

 versum under his monasticum is correct. From his description and figure of the 

 latter species it would appear to differ from transversum in having a pale trans- 

 verse band on the vertex, the pronotum more ample (5.5 by 8.5 mm.), with caudal 

 margin more strongly transverse, but with tegminal and wing length apparently 

 proportionate. Unfortunately Saussure did not give separate measurements 

 for the sexes. A smaller Brazilian female recorded by that author, having the 

 head dark and immaculate is apparently referable to transversum.

and flattened, with a few small, weak depressions and minute widely 

 scattered impressed punctae in caudal portion, which portion laterad 

 is bounded by low rounded ridges, strongly divergent from base of 

 hooded portion, then parellel to the shoulders; surface latero-caudad 

 thickly impresso-punctate, though not as heavily or thickly as in 

 signaticollis. Tegmina and wings fully developed, showing no re- 

 duction whatever and extending well beyond apex of abdomen. 

 Abdomen, including asymmetrical Panchloroid subgenital plate, 

 with straight, elongate, similar styles; limbs short; cephalic femora 

 supplied with a few minute chaetiform spines distad, terminating 

 in a single stout though greatly reduced spine; other femora unarmed, 

 lacking even genicular spines; large pul villi and large arolia between 

 the simple, symmetrical tarsal claws, all as characteristic of the 

 genus.

Agrees with the type, except as follows. Size larger, form some- 

 what broader, tegmina and wings showing some reduction, reach- 

 ing to base of supra-anal plate. Head broader and more flattened, 

 interocular space three-fifths that between antennal sockets, ocelli 

 smaller. Pronotum broader, the lateral angles slightly more caudad 

 in position, the cucullate and other raised portions minutely and 

 rather thickly impresso-punctate, though by no means as thickly 

 as in the male of signaticollis before us. Subgenital plate large, 

 simple, free margin broadly concave opposite cerci. 



General coloration (of males) deep chestnut-brown; the trans- 

 lucent latero-caudal portions of the pronotum and tegmina, when 

 held to the light, chestnut brown. Pronotum with cephalic third 

 dully transparent warm buff, the darker color invading this area in 

 cucullate portion to near the cephalic margin, the caudal borders 

 on each side straight, transverse, considerably cephalad of the lat- 

 eral angles. Ventral surface cinnamon-buff, the abdominal seg- 

 ments with lateral areas and femora distad paler, buckthorn brown. 

 Antennae blackish brown, becoming chestnut brown proximad. 



The female is similar but darker, more solidly blackish brown, 

 with cephalic third of pronotum dully transparent antimony yellow.

In addition to the described pair, a paratypic male and five im-

 face minutely and thickly tuberculate, these interspersed with more 

 prominent tubercles.

ate at caudal margins with cinnamon-buff, a medi-olongitudinal band 

 of this color on mesonotum and metanotum, the abdomen with 

 broadly projecting portions of tergites paler, tessellate, and with 

 a concentric paler tessellate area, this inclosing the median portion 

 of the median segment and first two tergites, which area is of 

 the darker ground color, the tergites each with a fleck cinnamon- 

 buff between the lateral and median areas. 



Without much larger series than have ever been assembled, the 

 separation of many of the species of such genera as the present, 

 Phoraspis, Paratropes and Tribonium, is a most difficult problem. 

 The differences shown by the forms recognized by us as Tribonidium 

 monasticum, transversum and amplwn, may indicate full specific 

 distinction, geographic racial differentiation or, indeed, mere in- 

 dividual variation in a single exceptionally plastic species. Addi- 

 tional material with full data would throw much light on this prob- 

 lem, if not definitely solving it. Color differences such as are 

 shown and different degrees of structural and tegminal and wing 

 modification are sometimes unimportant, sometimes of great diag- 

 nostic value. It is clear that in genera such as the present, where 

 limb armament is so greatly reduced and the genitalic features may 

 show generic but not specific differences, we are forced to weigh 

 the recognizable differences and to form conclusions as to their 

 value in each individual case, without the degree of assurance poss- 

 ible when familiar with other groups and working with even unique 

 individuals of many of the species.

Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 19,2 juv. 9 . 



Kirby first proposed this name for a species he recognized as 

 having large pulvilli and no arolia between the tarsal claws, referring 

 to Mouffet's figure published in 1634. That figure is extremely un- 

 satisfactory, though we do not agree with Burmeister in considering 

 it to resemble more closely Leucophaea maderae (Fabricius) than 

 the species now assigned to the genus Petasodes. In 1818, Kirby 

 has given a description of the insect, decidedly more comprehensive 

 than many of that time, and we follow Burmeister, but not sub- 

 sequent authors, in recognizing mouffeti as a distinct species. 



Compared with females of the other species of the genus before 

 us, the present female is seen to be decidedly narrower,with prono-

 the wings fully developed. 



Length of body 36, length of pronotum 11, width of pronotum

The immature condition of this species is extraordinarily hand- 

 some. Though moderately supplied with microscopic spines on 

 the dorsal surface (particularly on the thoracic segments, very spar- 

 ingly on the median segment and proximal abdominal tergites) 

 those before us have few particles of foreign matter adhering and 

 appear smooth and shining to the naked eye. The general coloration 

 is warm buff, the lamellate margins weakly transparent and light 

 buff, the insect beautifully marked with rich blackish brown, shad- 

 ing to prouts brown as shown by the figure. Adults and immatures 

 may be readily separated from those of Monastria biguttata (Thun- 

 berg) by the femoral spination. In the present species the cephalic 

 femora have on their ventro-cephalic margin a minute but heavy 

 distal spine, preceded by a few irregularly placed chaetiform spinu- 

 lae; the median and caudal femora bear only a minute but heavy 

 genicular spine.

Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, I cf , 4 juv. 



Adults and immatures may be quickly separated from those of 

 Petasodes mouffeti (Kirby) by the femora, which entirely lack heavy 

 spines, the cephalic femora being supplied distad on the ventro- 

 cephalic margin with minute chaetiform spines and dorsad along the 

 caudal portion of the distal margin with a few similar spinulae. 



All of the juveniles are heavily coated with foreign particles, 

 which gives them a dingy unattractive appearance. These particles 

 are seen under the miscroscope to be adhering to a multitude of 

 closely placed, minute and usually curved spines, which cover the 

 dorsal surface and marginal portions of the ventral surface. A 

 color pattern, somewhat resembling that of juveniles of P. mouffeti, 

 is barely discernible on the dorsal surface of the abdomen through 

 its dingy coating. 



CORYDIINAE. 

 CEUTHOBIELLA new genus. 

 1920. Melestora Hebard (not of Stal), Mem .Am. Ent. Soc, No. 4, p. 121. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 247 



To this genus belong the species described as Melestora minu- 

 tissima byRehn, fromlgarape-Assu, Para, Brazil, and as Melestora 

 micra by Hebard from Paraiso, Canal Zone, Panama. 



Genotype. â€” Ceuthobiella minutissima (Rehn). 



The genus is closely related to Ceuihobia, described on page 292, 

 males agreeing in the comparatively slender form, interocular space 

 not wrinkled, pronotum broadest meso-caudad with latero-caudal 

 oblique sulci moderately well defined but no trace of medio-longitu- 

 dinal sulcation, sinistral tegmen without a diagonal channel, wings 

 with radiate field folding fan-wise and dorsal surface of abdomen 

 with median segment specialized. 



It differs in the even smaller size, 63 darker general coloration, 

 minute and inconspicuous ocelli, tegmina with discoidal sectors al- 

 most longitudinal, 64 much narrower wings which are only slightly 

 over half as broad as long, scarcely appreciable costal veins which 

 are not clubbed distad, subobsolete intercalated triangle, sub- 

 genital plate more asymmetrical and showing a different type of 

 specialization and complete absence of genicular or other spines 

 on the femora. 65 



It would appear probable that Nothoblatta Bolivar (Mitth. Schweiz. 

 Ent. Ges., XI, p. 139, (1905).), including the single species, was- 

 manni Bolivar, belongs to the present group of genera and is nearest 

 to Ceuthobiella. From the literature, that genus apparently differs 

 in cephalic, palpal, pronotal, genitalic and tibial features. Un- 

 fortunately the description is vague concerning some of the most 

 important characters. 



Oulopteryx meliponarum new species. Plate XV, figures 7, 8, 9 and 10. 



This striking species is first Blattid known to inhabit the nests 

 of bees. The series from which it is described was taken from the 

 nest of the diminutive, black, stingless bee, Melipona nigra Lepele- 

 tier. 



Compared with 0. dascilloides, described on page 215, the pres- 

 ent insect is seen to differ in the much paler brown coloration, 

 somewhat less coriaceous and much more hairy pronotum and teg- 



63 The two described species are the smallest of the fully winged American 

 Blattidae known. Length of body, in normal position, approximately 4.5 mm. 



64 Only the last of these toward the sutural margin is seen to be weakly oblique 

 to that margin. 



65 The ventro-cephalic margins of the cephalic femora are supplied in distal 

 portion with a row of hairs, approaching the condition we term piliform spines, 

 (from type of A .minutissima) .

mina, more ample and distinctly more flattened pronotum, teg- 

 mina with costal margin less decidedly oblique in distal portion, 

 features of the genitalia and somewhat less decidedly atrophied 

 armament of the cephalic femora. 



The annulate antennae afford a striking feature of coloration. 



Type: o* ; Fazenda do Sobrado, near Passo-Quatro, Minas Geraes, 

 Brazil. June. [Paris Museum.] 



In addition to the characters given in the generic description on 

 page 214, we record the following. Eyes extending briefly ventrad 

 of antennal sockets, convergent lateral margins of cheeks to clypeal 

 suture brief. Interocular space slightly over half width between 

 antennal sockets. Maxillary palpi with fifth joint large, slightly 

 shorter than third, fourth joint two-thirds as long as third joint. 

 Pronotum with bosses of disk smooth, showing a somewhat lyrate 

 pattern; other portions, including weak bosses at humeral shoulders, 

 heavily impresso-punctate. Tegmina moderately coriaceous, ex- 

 tending distinctly beyond cereal apices, margins converging evenly 

 distad. Wings with rolls of folded appendicular fields lying ob- 

 liquely. Median segment as described for dascilloides. Supra- 

 anal plate with length equal to about one-fourth proximal width, 

 suddenly and strongly concave in meso-distal portion, lateral mar- 

 gins convergent and forming rather broadly convex projections on 

 eacji side of this area, moderately supplied with long hairs in these 

 portions, median section of margin nearly transverse, showing a 

 very feeble convexity, without hairs. The ventral surface of this 

 plate is symmetrically specialized, mesad on each side at the base 

 of the projecting portions it is produced in a transverse and chiti- 

 nous triangular projection, with apex acute and curved outward 

 toward each side, these fang-like processes lie on the deeply concave 

 faces of two large subchitinous, symmetrical plates, which, spring- 

 ing from near the cereal bases, are transverse and vertical, reaching 

 to the anal opening. Subgenital plate small and nearly symmetri- 

 cal, lateral margins equally oblique, the sinistral very feebly convex, 

 the dextral as feebly concave, rounding into the transverse distal 

 margin at the style sockets. Styles similar, simple, straight, cylin- 

 drical, not tapering except at the rounded apex, each about six 

 times as long as its width, three-quarters as long as the distance 

 between the style bases. Cephalic femora with ventro-cephalic 

 margin supplied distad with minute, piliform, well separated spines, 

 terminated by a single elongate, heavy distal spine. 



Allotype: 9 ; same data as type. [Paris Museum.] 



Agrees closely with the male sex, differing in the following fea- 

 tures. Interocular space wider, nearly as wide as that between the 

 antennal sockets. Tegmina and wings showing some slight reduc- 

 tion, extending to cereal apices. Dorsal surface of abdomen un- 

 specialized. Supra-anal plate slightly over two-fifths as long as 

 proximal width lateral margins nearly straight, oblique to the 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 249 



rather broadly truncate apical portion, the surface of which is 

 weakly concave. Subgenital plate broad, the meso-distal portion 

 (approximately one-sixth of the entire surface) moderately pro- 

 duced, occupied by two rounded-triangular plates, forming nearly 

 vertical valves and separated proximad from the basal portion of 

 the plate by a strongly concave margin. 



Coloration of sexes similar. Head bright ochraceous-tawny, be- 

 coming ochraceous-orange on occiput, which portion is marked 

 with suffused vertical stripes of rich chestnut brown. Proximal 

 antennal joints, mouthparts and all but distal joint of maxillary 

 palpi ochraceous-buff, last joint of maxillary palpi cinnamon-brown. 

 Antennae in remaining portions mummy brown, near distal ex- 

 tremity with an annulus of light buff (occupying usually three, 

 rarely as many as five, joints). Pronotum shining russet. Teg- 

 mina translucent, shining mars brown, paling slightly laterad and 

 distad to russet; portion of dextral tegmen, concealed when at rest, 

 transparent, weakly tinged with tawny. Wings delicate, trans- 

 parent, very faintly tinged with ochraceous-buff, this more decided 

 in area of costal veins and in radiate field toward its juncture with 

 the appendicular field. Dorsal surface of mesonotum, metanotum 

 and abdomen light ochraceous-buff, the latter in all but proximal 

 portion with a broad marginal suffusion of prouts brown, which 

 broadens distad to include the supra-anal plate and preceding ter- 

 gites. Cerci cinnamon brown. Ventral surface ochraceous-tawny, 

 often pale and tinged with orange, suffused laterad with prouts 

 brown, this not as broad as dorsad. Limbs ochraceous-buff tinged 

 with tawny. 



In the immature condition the shining dorsal surface is tawny or 

 russet, deepening to mars brown laterad. The striking antennal 

 and other markings are as in the adults.

MELESTORA Stal. 



1858. Melestora Stal, Kongl. Svenska Freg. Eugenie's Resa, Zool., I, p. 311. 



We regret to state that, from the material now available, we are 

 convinced that our recent characterization of the genus 66 is incor- 

 rect, applying instead to the genus Ceuthobia, described on page 292. 



The genus Melestora as here defined, includes the South American 

 species adspersipennis Stal, fuscella Stal and argentina (Rehn). 67 



Genotype. â€” Melestora adspersipennis Stal. 68 



This genus shows, in the male sex, nearest relationship to Comp- 

 sodes, agreeing in the elliptical pronotum with a medio-longitudinal 

 sulcus 69 and somewhat impressed disk, femora not strikingly en- 

 larged, sinistral as well as dextral tegmen with a conspicuous diag- 

 onal channel 70 and discoidal sectors oblique, wings with anterior 

 field over twice the area of the radiate field, with ulnar vein develop- 

 ing complete arcuate branches and radiate field proximal in position 

 and not folding, dorsal surface of abdomen with third tergite spec- 

 ialized mesad 71 and pulvilli absent. 



We find that Melestora as properly restricted, 72 differs from Comp- 

 sodes in the male sex in having the interocular area decidedly 

 wrinkled, the median and caudal femora supplied on their ventro- 

 cephalic margins with a single distal spine, as well as having the 

 genicular spine, which is present in both genera. 



These genera represent a distinctive group, particularly striking 

 in having the anterior field of the wings very large, in area approxi-

67 Incorrectly referred by us to the genus Compsodes, at the time that genus 

 was described. Mem. Am. Ent. Soc, No. 2, p. 209, (1917). 



68 Selected by Kirby, Syn. Cat. Orth., I, p. 167, (1904). 



69 In the aberrant Compsodes cucullatus (Saussure and Zehntner), the pronotum 

 is produced over the head, the cephalic margin showing greater angulation, while 

 the medio-longitudinal sulcus is subobsolete. 



70 This channel is not shown by Stal's figure. That author's description of 

 the interocular area and pronotum leads us to the present conclusion and the 

 belief that the diagonal channel was by accident omitted from the figure. 



71 This was not noted by us in our description of Compsodes schwarzi (Caudell) , 

 Mem. Am. Ent. Soc, No. 2. p. 211, (1917). In that species the third tergite is 

 weakly impressed meso-proximad, with a minute node mesad, surrounded by very 

 minutely microscopic hairs, the caudal margin of the preceding tergite weakly 

 raised, thus showing a broad convexity above this. 



72 Judging from the data given by Stal, material of argentina at hand and a 

 series representing all of the known species of Compsodes.

mating that of the tegmen, and radiate field very small and not 

 folding. 



Though very close, we believe that Melestora and Compsodes 

 represent distinct generic units, occupying the same position in 

 the biota of the regions where they are found, the former in the 

 southern portion of tropical South America, the latter in tropical 

 North America.

The present material is assignable without question to Walker's 

 cynipsoides, which name has been placed in synonymy under H . 

 fieberi (Brunner) by Kirby. We do not believe Kirby's action to 

 be correct, but examination of the type of fieberi alone can verify 

 this. It would seem probable that Brunner would have described 

 the large and strikingly pale spot of warm buff, on each side of 

 the abdomen latero-proximad, had his material shown this feature. 

 This marking is, as described by Walker, conspicuous, occupying the 

 lateral portions of the first and second tergites and corresponding 

 area ventrad, and shows through the fenestrate tegmina when these 

 are at rest.

spiniform hairs. The dextral style bears mesad on its external face 

 a stout chitinous spine, directed proximo-dextrad and curved proxi- 

 mad. The intervening triangular production between the bases 

 of the styles has a minute but stout spine at its apex, another much 

 smaller spine on the dextral margin, the sinistral margin being 

 broadly subchitinous. 



The general structure and very faintly tessellate tegmina indicate 

 the close affinity of this species to those of the genus recorded below.

The males have the styles longer than in C. perlucida (Walk- 

 er), the dextro-proximal specialization of the sinistral style and 

 intervening triangular production between the bases of the styles 

 in every way similar, the dextral style with a much smaller, minute, 

 spine mesad on its dorsal margin, directed proximad. 



Saussure 's original description would appear to have been taken 

 from a smaller individual, the material before us agreeing better 

 with Brunner's characterization of his Brazilian flavoantennata and 

 with Saussure and Zehntner's discussion of material from Rio 

 Grande do Sul, Brazil, at the time those authors placed flavoanten- 

 nata in the present synonymy. 



The tegminal tessellation in these specimens agrees closely with 

 that of C. perlucida (Walker). It is, however, a trifle more distinct, 

 while in two individuals the veins proximad are weakly whitish.

that Dasyposoma is a synonym of Hormetica ; the genotype and other 



species referred to, representing immature individuals of Hormetica 



in the later instars, as discussed below.

This specimen agrees closely with an immature female in the 

 same instar from Puerto Bertoni, Paraguay, recorded by Rehn 

 as Dasyposoma nigra and apparently referable to Hormetica atlas 

 Rehn, which species is very closely allied to the present. 



Recent studies of a large series of both sexes, including adults and 

 immatures, of Hormetica apolinari Hebard, from Colombia, have 

 shown that in that species the early stages lacked pulvilli, the adults 

 having well-developed pulvilli. Futhermore it was found that 

 Saussure 's Dasyposoma marmorata was based on the immature 

 condition of a species of Hormetica closely related to apolinari. 



The present material is, we believe, referable to Hormetica ventralis, 

 and it is highly probable that Brunner 's Dasyposoma nigra is 

 based on the immature condition of this species; certain it is that 

 the name is referable to this or one of the very closely related species 

 of Hormetica. 14 The two immatures of Brazilian species at hand 

 also lack arolia though the surface of the tarsal joint between the 

 tarsal claws is swollen in this instar, apparently the last preceding 

 maturity. 



74 Of these we have before us adults, representing both sexes, referred to laevi- 

 gata Burmeister, atlas Rehn and scrobiculata Burmeister, which have been fully 

 discussed by Rehn, Trans. Am. Ent. Soc, XLIII, p, 341, (1917).

As nigra has been designated gentoype of Dasyposoma, that genus 

 inconsequence falls in synonymy under Hormetica. 



The coloration of the immature here recorded is as follows. 

 Dorsal surface blackish brown, shining and polished except caudad, 

 where minute subdenticulations roughen the surface; cingulate mar- 

 gins of pronotum, mesonotum and metanotum mars brown. Head 

 mars brown paling to russet on occiput and mouthparts, eyes 

 ochraceous-tawny, ocellar areas more buffy. Antennae with two 

 proximal joints ochraceous-tawny, remainder dark mummy brown, 

 except for a meso-distal annulus of light ochraceous-buff, occupy- 

 ing five joints. Limbs chestnut brown paling to ochraceous-buff

Section III. Northern Argentina. 



The collection from this region, belonging to the Paris Museum, 

 is large and to it have been added a considerable series from the 

 the Hebard Collection, originally the property of Professor Law- 

 rence Bruner. A total of 370 specimens has been recorded, in- 

 cluding 22 genera and 37 species, of which 2 genera and 16 species 

 are new. 



As a result we have been able to study a much larger series of 

 Argentinian Blattidae than has ever previously been assembled. 

 The species recorded from the subtropical section of northern Ar- 

 gentina represent we believe, a fairly large proportion of the cock- 

 roaches which there occur. 



Though the Blattidae of Argentina have been by no means ne- 

 glected in past literature, the fact that over forty-five percent of 

 the species here treated represent new forms, shows that this 

 family has previously received scant attention by collectors. The 

 extremely rich fauna of southern Brazil is continued into tropical 

 northern Argentina, and it is probable that but a small proportion 

 of the Blattidae of that region are as yet known. 



Of particular interest are the brachypterous species of the genera 

 Cariblatta and Neoblattella, the large number of species of the genus 

 Ischnoptera ( of which the species caracana shows extraordinary 

 male dimorphism), the distinctive Pseudischnoptera rhabdota, the 

 species of Epilampra in which the sexes show decided to very great 

 dissimilarity and the five small species of the Corydiinae.

 area very dark, as well as in characters of the genitalia, particularly 

 the distinctive specialization of the sixth tergite. 



Type: o"; Carcarafia, Santa Fe, Argentina. [Hebard Collection, 

 Type no. 680.] 



Size small, form graceful, structure delicate as characteristic of 

 the genus. Interocular space about three-quarters as wide as that 

 between antennal sockets. Ocellar spots distinct, ocellar areas 

 rounding into interocellar area. Maxillary palpi moderately elong- 

 ate, third and fifth joints of equal length, fourth joint slightly 

 shorter. Lateral margins of face rather strongly convergent to 

 clypeal suture. Pronotum broadly rounded, symmetrically trap- 

 ezoidal, the greatest width near the caudal margin, that margin 

 transverse, very broadly convex; surface of pronotum weakly con- 

 vex. Tegmina and wings extending well beyond cereal apices. 

 Tegmina with numerous, decidedly oblique, discoidal sectors. 

 Wings with (7) heavily clubbed costal veins, with (6) complete 

 branches of the ulnar vein, intercalated triangle small but distinct. 

 Sixth tergite with a large projection meso-caudad, formed by two 

 rounded ridges which unite cephalad, thus forming a V-shaped prom- 

 inence,' surface strongly concave cephalad and laterad of this 

 prominence, supplied cephalad with numerous agglutinated hairs, 

 directed caudad and reaching as far as the blunt apex of the prom- 

 inence. Supra-anal plate broadly transverse. Paired plate be- 

 neath supra-anal plate large and unspecialized. Other concealed 

 genitalic processes complex. Subgenital plate asymmetrical; sinis- 

 trad more produced than dextrad, with dextral portion curled up- 

 ward and inward ; styles inset, the dextral decidedly the more so. 

 Sinistral style a flattened lobe, about twice as long as broad, ex- 

 panding slightly to the truncate apex, the angles of which are broadly 

 rounded. Dextral style somewhat similar but more elongate and 

 slender and curled strongly dextrad toward apex, the base of which 

 portion touches that of the sinistral style. Between the rather 

 irregularly formed styles the median portion of the plate is triangu- 

 larly produced, nearly filling the interspace between them. Limbs, 

 armament, pulvilli and arolia as characteristic of genus. 75 



Head with occiput ochraceous-buff tinged with tawny, deepening 

 ventrad, with inter-ocular-ocellar area auburn and remaining por- 

 tions of face blackish chestnut, ocellar spots light buff, antennae 

 snuff brown, the first joint darker proximad. Pronotum with two 

 broad longitudinal bars of deep chestnut brown, which broaden and 

 diverge slightly caudad throughout their length, intervening area 

 mars brown, except in a transverse, rectangulate area caudad which 

 is ochraceous-buff; lateral portions of pronotum transparent, feebly 

 tinged with buff. Tegmina with marginal field and marginal por-

tion of scapular field transparent, feebly tinged with buff, thenee 

 becoming suddenly rich chestnut brown, which gradually becomes 

 more dilute distad and toward the costal margin and is there weakly 

 tawny. Wings almost clear hyaline, showing a very faint tawny 

 tinge toward the free margins of the anterior field and with enlarged 

 portions of costal veins white. Abdomen with dorsal surface to 

 sixth tergite blackish brown, narrowly margined laterad with och- 

 raceous-buff, except that the sixth has a suffusion of blackish brown 

 on each side. Cerci chestnut brown, shading to prouts brown dis- 

 tad and narrowly buffy proximad toward the internal margin. Ven- 

 tral surface of thoracic segments and bases of trochanters chestnut 

 brown, limbs light ochraceous-buff. Ventral surface of abdomen 

 with lateral margins ochraceous-buff, proximad and laterad black- 

 ish brown, this leaving the median portion of the mesal section and 

 all of the distal portion ochraceous-buff. 



Length of body 9.7-9.3, 76 length of pronotum 2.7-2.7, width of 

 pronotum 3.7-3.6, length of tegmen 10.3-9.9, width of tegmen 3-3

This interesting species is distinguished from the genotype, D. 

 thaumasia, described on page 225, both known only from the male 

 sex, by its smaller size, pale coloration, much wider interocular 

 space and striking genitalia. 



The genitalic specialization in these species is seen to represent 

 a distinctive type, the two agreeing in general character of develop- 

 ment.

In addition to the characters given in the generic description on 

 page 224, the following are considered of specific value. Inter- 

 ocular space slightly over one-half occipital ocular depth, three- 

 fifths that between antennal sockets; impressed punctae, the sockets 

 of hairs, particularly conspicuous in the inter-ocular-ocellar area. 

 Third joint of maxillary palpi four-fifths as long as the large fifth 

 joint, slightly longer than the fourth joint. Hirsute tegmina sub- 

 coriaceous in appearance, due to the fact that the hairs are invisible 

 except under the microscope; area of dextral tegmen, concealed 

 when at rest, hairless; discoidal sectors (9-10) best termed longi- 

 tudinal, though toward the sutural margin the last of those in the 

 sinistral tegmen is weakly oblique to that margin, while toward the 

 sutural margin several in the dextral tegmen are slightly irregular

and moderately oblique. Abdominal tergites apparently much as 

 described for thaumasia on page 225. 78 Subgenital plate curled 

 upward and inward sinistro-proximad beside the base of the supra- 

 anal plate and there with a small rounded node, produced caudad 

 beside the lateral margin of the supra-anal plate, its apex armed 

 with two straight chaetiform spines directed caudad. Supra-anal 

 plate three-fifths as long as its proximal width, weakly chitinous in 

 distal portion, this area defined from the proximal area by a delicate 

 but distinct, straight, transverse sulcus, lateral margins feebly con- 

 cave, not convergent to bases of cerci, straight and strongly oblique 

 to within these, the remaining portion roundly produced, with median 

 emargination feebly suggested. Subgenital plate with sinistro-proxi- 

 mal portion specialized as described above, beyond this with surface 

 moderately convex so that the very broadly and irregularly convex 

 margin nearly touches the cercus, bearing on its internal surface at 

 the margin beneath the cercus a stout straight spine, directed dorso- 

 mesad, this section of the margin terminating at the small simple sin- 

 istral style, situated just within the sinistral cercus; this style cylin- 

 drical, about twice as long as broad, directed dorso-mesad; beyond 

 this point the margin is very deeply and roundly concave to the dex- 

 tral style, similar but smaller and more tapering, situated slightly sin- 

 istrad of the median point and directed dextro-caudad, the internal 

 surface of the plate at the base of this style bearing two stout spines 

 of equal length curved caudad; remaining large dextral section of 

 the plate curled inward beneath dextral cercus and supra-anal plate 

 to slightly beyond this point, the dorsal outline of the projection 

 triangular, with apex bluntly rounded. Concealed genitalia com- 

 plex, the paired plate beneath the supra-anal plate apparently 

 developed into projections armed with minute teeth. 79 



General coloration of entire insect ochraceous-buff. Vertex to

 Ocelli light buff. Disk of pronotum with a tawny orange tinge.

Though even less striking in general appearance than thaumasia, 

 this unique specimen also represents actually one of the most re- 

 markably specialized forms of the Blattidae known to us.

tegmina are reduced sufficiently to leave exposed the distal portion 

 of the abdomen, but in that race these organs narrow to the rather 

 sharply rounded apices. In mesembrina the tegmina are truncate 

 distad, the costal margin rounding very broadly into the transverse 

 distal margin, so that these organs leave almost the entire dorsal 

 surface of the abdomen exposed. 



Though apparently nearest lutea minima, the present species is 

 seen to approach that race only in features governed by reduction 

 in the organs of flight and to be derived from a different phylum, 

 the development of the pronotal picturing and cephalic marking 

 being distinctive. 



From the pronotal picturing, we believe it best to place the species 

 in linear arrangement after C. fossicauda Hebard, described from 

 Trinidad. 



The adult male probably shows distinctive genitalic features, 

 as is indicated by the immature examples of that sex at hand.

 ing practically no convexity. Tegmina strongly reduced, over- 

 lapping but not reaching beyond median segment, costal margin 

 rounding very broadly into transverse distal margin, sutural margin 

 straight, rounding suddenly into distal margin a short distance 

 beyond the anal field, with longitudinal trend of discoidal sectors

 as caudal metatarsus, the four proximal tarsal joints supplied with 

 moderately well-developed pul villi. Large arolia present between

 brown, the latter with a fleck of prouts brown meso-distad. Limbs 

 ochraceous-buff, the cephalic femora delicately margined dorsad 

 and all the dorsal spines of the tibiae with flecks at their bases of 

 prouts brown. Abdomen with ventral surface bordered narrowly 

 laterad with light ochraceous-buff, this margined internally with 

 prouts brown, within which is a fleck of the same color on each seg-

82 The specialization of the tarsal claws was not recognized at the time the 

 genus Cariblatta was described. It is apparent that in degenerate forms this 

 specialization is much reduced or obsolete. In delicatula and other long-winged 

 species, a flange, minutely but conspicuously serrulate, is found, but in lutea lutea 

 and lutea minima this has entirely disappeared, leaving no trace even of ser- 

 rulation.

for the first time, showing the contrasting differences between 

 conspersa and platystylata, described on page 229. 



The females of these species are separated with difficulty, as com- 

 mented upon under platystylata. In the present insect the lateral 

 margins of the female subgenital plate on each side of the meso- 

 distal portion are produced dorsad in small plates, the truncate 

 apices of these armed with a regular series of (usually 7) equal, 

 chaetiform spines. At the base of these plates, within the anal 

 chamber on the dorsal surface of the subgenital plate, are situated 

 projections of similar character, but more reduced and bearing a 

 lesser number of spines. The size and form of these appendages 

 is subject to some individual variation. In all but these two species 

 of the genus Neoblattella known to us, the female subgenital plate 

 shows no trace of such specialization. 



The males at hand have the meso-distal portion of the supra-anal 

 plate showing some individual variation. In this sex the sub- 

 genital plate is immaculate, the dark marking of the ventral sur- 

 face of the abdomen not extending that far caudad; this is true for 

 the Argentinian females also, but not for the more intensively col- 

 ored females from Igarape-Assu, Para, Brazil.

1915. Ceratinoplera puerilis Rehn, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1915, p. 

 273, fig. I. [cf; Misiones, Argentina.] 



The type of this species now before us, shows that it agrees in 

 all valid generic features with the genus Neoblattella. Species of 

 that genus, however, showing decidedly reduced tegmina, were 

 previously unrecognized. 



The insect is clearly of more recent common ancestry with the 

 genotype, A T . adspersicollis (Stal), than many of the species which 

 we believe to be properly referable to Neoblattella and it would 

 appear advisable to assign it to the Adspersicollis Group, though 

 additional evidence may show it and the species described below 

 to belong to a distinct, though closely related, group. 



The broad form; arrangement of dark punctae on face and disk 

 of pronotum; simple, straight, elongate similar styles; large pulvilli, 

 and decided serration of the flange of the tarsal claws, are all features 

 shared by adspersicollis. 



The smaller spines of the ventro-cephalic margin of the cephalic 

 femora are irregularly interspersed with a few (3 and 4) chaetiform 

 spines, showing some slight divergence from the condition usually 

 shown by the species of the genus. 



Neoblattella tapenagae new species. Plate X, figure 8. 



Close relationship to N. puerilis (Rehn) is shown. Compared 

 with the male type of that species, females are readily distinguish- 

 able by the richer coloration and distinctive markings of head, 

 pronotum and tegmina, the type "B" armament of the ventro- 

 cephalic margins of the cephalic femora and even larger pulvilli. 



This is the first case in our studies of the Blattellae where, in the 

 same genus, the armament of the ventro-cephalic margin of the 

 cephalic femora is found to be of type "A" in most species, but as 

 clearly of type "B" in one case. Transitional stages are shown in 

 N. puerilis (Rehn) and N. janeirae, described on page 226. This 

 difference, we feel we can safely state, may be used as a criterion 

 for generic separation in most genera of the Blattellae, but the 

 characterization of Neoblattella, much the largest genus of the group, 

 must be changed to include both types.

the adjacent portions. Lateral margins of cheeks weakly conver- 

 gent ventrad. Maxillary palpi moderately short for the genus, 

 fourth joint nearly as long as third, large fifth joint three-quarters 

 as long as fourth. Tegmina decidedly reduced, covering slightly 

 less than half the dorsal surface of the abdomen; costal margin very 

 gently arcuate, broadly rounding distad into the broadly rounded 

 distal margin, sutural margin nearly straight, rounding much more 

 suddenly, though broadly, into the distal margin; venation dis- 

 tinct, the cauda] margin cutting the veins abruptly, the discoidal 

 sectors (3 to 6 in the series) cut off before reaching a truly longitudi- 

 nal direction, so that the portions shown appear very weakly oblique 

 to the sutural margin 85 . Wings vestigal, extending to the caudad 

 margin of the metanotum. Supra-anal plate two-fifths as long as its 

 basal width, lateral margins broadly concave-convergent to dis- 

 tal portion, which is bilobate, due to a moderate meso-distal emar- 

 gination (which is sharp in the type, rounded in the paratype). 

 Subgenital plate simple, large, weakly produced, the free margin 

 weakly concave beneath the cerci and mesad, weakly convex be- 

 tween these portions. Ventro-cephalic margin of cephalic femora 

 armed with (4 to 6; in the case of the greater number, with the last 

 two considerably smaller) heavy, elongate, well-spaced proximal 

 spines, succeeded by a row of (11 to 15) minute, closely placede 

 chaetiform spinulae, terminated by three heavy spines, elongats 

 in increasing ratio distad. Pulvilli of four proximal tarsal joint, 

 unusually large for the genus, occupying the entire ventral surfaces 

 of the three tarsal joints succeeding the metatarsus, apices acute, 

 Tarsal claws symmetrical, well-developed flanges with (5) teeth 

 decided. Moderately well-developed arolia present. 



Head with vertex light ochraceous-tawny with an orange tinge, 

 a large transverse suffusion of chestnut-brown between the ventral 

 portions of the eyes and dorsal portions of the antennal sockets, 

 ocellar spots and face ochraceous-buff, the latter with a narrow, 

 transverse suffusion of chestnut-brown above the clypeus, which 

 broadens on the cheeks. In one paratype there is an additional 

 narrower transverse suffusion of the same color between these. 

 Pronotum in median portion light ochraceous-tawny with an orange 

 tinge, this bordered on each side by a longitudinal suffusion of 

 chestnut-brown, which broadens caudad; disk with light flecks of 

 chestnut brown, 86 three in an oblique row on each side mesad, two 

 caudad ; lateral portions transparent, faintly tinged with buff y, mar- 

 gins themselves buffy with an orange tinge. Tegmina showing a 

 continuation of the pronotum coloring, the suffusion of the humeral 



85 This is not true of puerilis, in which the tegminal reduction is as great, but 

 the brief portions of the discoidal sectors are plainly longitudinal to the sutural 

 margin. It would appear that reduction of these organs affects the direction of 

 the veins more in some species than in others.

 by small, weak suffusions and lines, giving a more nearly pictured appearance.

 veins paler, dresden brown, but intervening areas chestnut-brown. 

 Mesonotum and metanotum ochraceous-buff. Abdomen dorsad 

 shining blackish brown, the broader tergites narrowly margined 

 laterad with ochraceous-buff and with weak, paired, small buffy 

 flecks mesad. Cerci blackish brown, becoming buffy disto-dorsad. 

 Limbs light ochraceous-buff with an orange tinge, very narrowly 

 marked with prouts brown at bases of spines, tarsal joints each heav- 

 ily suffused with prouts brown distad. Ventral surface of abdomen 

 shining blackish brown, narrowly margined laterad with ochraceous- 

 buff, this including the proximal portion of the subgenital plate. 



In a large immature female before us the coloration is much darker. 

 Dorsal surface, except hyaline lateral portions of thoracic segments, 

 which are tinged with dresden brown, blackish brown, this slightly 

 deeper laterad, with slightly paler flecks on the broader abdominal 

 tergites.

266 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART II 



After careful study of the series at hand, the material previously 

 recorded as /. vilis Saussure from Paraguay and the Argentine, and 

 the literature, we are convinced that a single variable species is 

 represented. In coloration, a series of males from Sapucay, Para- 

 guay, agree with the male type of vilis, desribed from Corrientes, 

 Argentina, in having the lateral portions of the pronotum slightly 

 paler and more reddish than the dark brown remaining portions. 

 Three Paraguayan males, however, are at hand with pronotum 

 solidly colored. In the Argentinian material all of the males have 

 the pronotum solidly colored, varying from dark brown to rather 

 light reddish brown. In all specimens showing the bicolored prono- 

 tal condition before us, the femora are very dark brown the remain- 

 ing portions very contrastingly colored ; this limb coloration appears 

 in the Argentinian material, but shows slightly less decided con- 

 trast, varying to a condition in which the limbs are uniform light 

 brown. This latter condition is shown by the majority of the Ar- 

 gentinian males, as well as by two of the three Paraguayan males 

 with unicolorous pronotum. The vertex is individually dark or 

 pale. 



In the concealed genitalia we find the paired plate beneath the 

 supra-anal plate to be very large, the dextral plate much the larger, 

 with periphery rounded, bearing along its ventral margin numerous 

 spiniform hairs and near the distal portion of this margin with a 

 small, irregular, chitinous area, flanked byachitinous spine directed 

 distad. In the entire Paraguayan series this spine, though variable 

 in heaviness and length, is free and averages heavier than in the 

 Argentinian material showing that condition. In other Argentinian 

 specimens the spine is indicated only as a sharp, slender, chitinous 

 projection along the external margin of thesubchitinous area, which 

 is not free. It would appear to be true that the Paraguayan ma- 

 terial shows incipient racial differentiation, but this has not, in our 

 opinion, yet reached either sufficient degree or stability to war- 

 rant nominal recognition. 



Comparison of the females before us, with Giglio-Tos ' description 

 of Loboptera borellii, shows that name to be based on material re- 

 presenting that sex of the present species.

The elongate triangular, pad-like, lateral tegmina of females of 

 the present species show a differentiation in this sex somewhat simi- 

 lar to that developed in J. deropeltiformis (Brunner) . These species, 

 however, do not belong to the same species group, as stated by us 

 in 1917. 91 One striking feature of difference between the females 

 of these species is that in those of ignobilis vestigial wings are present 

 as minute pads beneath the apices of the tegmina, their very apices 

 alone sometimes projecting and scarcely extending beyond the 

 caudal margin of the metanotum. 



The Gran Chaco specimens average large for the species, all but 

 one having the pronotum solidly blackish brown. A single speci- 

 men has the pronotum dull mahogany red, becoming bay caudad; 

 the tegmina, as in the others, chestnut tinged with bay proximad. 



The individuals in the Icano series average smaller, all having the 

 pronotum solidly colored, blackish brown to chestnut brown, the 

 tegmina agreeing with the pronotum in coloration except in two, 

 which have the pronotum very dark but these organs deep chestnut. 



Ischnoptera car car ana new species. Plate XI, figures 1, 2 and 3. 



This is a small species, showing, however, closer relationship to 

 the much larger I. ignobilis Saussure than to the numerous other 

 small species of the genus. 



The general coloration is darker than in ignobilis ; the limbs strik- 

 ingly bicolored, as is sometimes the case in that species. The con- 

 cealed male genitalia are distinctive, while in the brachypterous 

 males and the females the triangular lateral tegminal pads are 

 smaller than in females of ignobilis and wing pads are not present. 



A feature which we have never hitherto met with in studying the 

 Blattidae is the complete and non-intergrading dimorphism de- 

 veloped in the male sex of this species. Two males before us have 

 fully developed tegmina and wings. Three males show the general 

 contour, tegmina represented by minute lateral pads and complete 

 absence of wings, such as is true for the two females at hand. 



Though certain species are known to develop all degrees of teg- 

 minal and wing reduction, from a fully developed to a much re- 

 duced type, it would appear unlikely that intermediate conditions 

 occur in males of carcarana, so extreme and clear cut are the mac- 

 ropterous and brachypterous conditions shown. The brachypter- 

 ous type, in fact, shows for both sexes a retention in the adult con- 



91 Mem. Am. Ent. Soc, No. 2, p. 62. 




268 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART II 



dition of many features of the early stages. The macropterous 

 males show the usual differentiation from the early stages developed 

 by adults of the normal macropterous species of Ischnoptera. 



The close agreement of the brachypterous males and females 

 offers ample evidence that they represent a single species. The 

 macropterous males are assigned to the same species through their 

 close similarity in genitalic characters, limb armament and color- 

 ation, the differences shown being wholly attributable to the fac- 

 tors discussed above. 



Type: cf; Carcarana, Santa Fe, Argentina. [Hebard Collect- 

 ion Type no. 704.] 



Size small, form rather slender for the genus. Interocular space 

 broad, as wide as that between the antennal sockets. Ocellar spots 

 moderately large, though small and poorly defined for the genus, 

 the area which they occupy not sharply delimited from the inter- 

 ocular-ocellar and rounding into it. Maxillary palpi with fourth 

 joint three-quarters as long as third, third joint three-quarters as 

 long as the elongate fifth joint. Latero-caudal sulci of pronotal 

 disk deep and strongly defined. Tegmina and wings extending 

 well beyond the cereal apices. Wings with a small intercalated 

 triangle, ulnar vein with (3) incomplete and (1) complete branches. 

 Dorsal surface of abdomen specialized as characteristic of genus. 

 Supra-anal plate symmetrical, trapezoidal with angles rounded, 

 width between cerci about twice length, surface weakly concave 

 except above cereal bases and meso-distad on each side where it is 

 weakly convex, distal margin transverse, showing weak lateral 

 convexity and very broad and weak median emargination, so that 

 a sub-bilobate condition is developed; ventral surface with a very 

 delicate transverse ridge between cereal bases and supplied distad 

 with elongate hairs. Paired plate beneath supra-anal plate de- 

 veloped into very large, flattened lobes; the sinistral forming an 

 unarmed transverse ridge toward its dorsal margin, the dextral 

 with a heavier transverse ridge mesad, this ridge, as well as the por- 

 tion of the plate ventrad, armed with a number of minute but stout 

 spines. Titillator elongate and very slender, widening slightly be- 

 fore the aciculate apex but unspecialized. Subgenital plate with 

 surface strongly convex, except in produced area where it is 

 weakly concave; sinistral margin oblique and rather strongly con- 

 cave to median portion, dextral margin oblique and more broadly 

 concave a greater distance, the portion of the margin between being 

 short, straight, transverse. Sinistral style situated on sinistral mar- 

 gin mesad of the cercus, simple, cylindrical, weakly tapering to the 

 sharply rounded apex, with shaft weakly decurved, covered with 

 coarse hairs as is the subgenital plate. Dextral style situated me- 

 sad on the short, transverse distal margin, very similar but slightly 

 shorter, with decurvature slightly greater and apex slightly blunter

and armed with minute spines. Armament of limbs as character- 

 istic of the genus. Four proximal tarsal joints supplied distad 

 with small but readily observed pulvilli. Moderately well devel- 

 oped arolia present between the slender, simple, symmetrical tarsal 

 claws. 



Allotype: 9 ; Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina. [Paris

Agrees with macropterous male type except in the following 

 characters. Size larger, form broader. Interocular space dis- 

 tinctly wider than that between antennal sockets. Ocellar spots 

 smaller, ocellar areas not differentiated. Pronotum with latero- 

 caudal sulci of disk obsolete; greatest width at latero-caudal angles; 

 caudal margin truncate, very broadly convex, transverse. Teg- 

 mina minute, rounded triangular, broad, lateral pads, extending 

 only slightly beyond caudal margin of mesonotum, but with ven- 

 ation distinct. Wings absent. Supra-anal plate slightly less than 

 half as long as its basal width, triangularly produced with apex 

 sharply rounded. p Subgenital plate convex, with free margin 

 broadly convex. Limbs slightly heavier. 



Three brachypterous males, which we have discussed above, 

 agree in all but genitalic features with the allotype, except that 

 the interocular space is only slightly wider than that between the 

 antennal sockets. 



Head shining blackish, ocellar spots buffy, palpi blackish chest- 

 nut brown, mouth-parts cinnamon brown. Pronotum solidly black- 

 ish. Tegmina of male blackish and opaque proximad, weakening 

 mesad, becoming translucent tinged with prouts brown, and trans- 

 parent distad, very weakly tinged with prouts brown, as is the area 

 of the dextral tegmen which is concealed when at rest. Tegmina 

 of female blackish and opaque. Body, cerci, coxae and femora 

 blackish chestnut brown. Tibiae and tarsi tawny.

This species is very closely related to J. rufa (De Geer), differing

 dish general coloration of the males and differently shaped female 

 supra-anal plate. 93 



It is probable that it was the present, or a related undescribed 

 speces, which Giglio-Tos has recorded as rufa from San Lorenzo, 

 Argeintina and San Francisco and Caiza, Bolivia. 94

 very light specimens of I. ignobilis Saussure. 95 



Type: cT; San Nicolas, Buenos Aires, Argentina. November 5,

Size medium large, form moderately stout. Head with inter- 

 ocular space appreciably narrower than that between the ocelli, 

 (varying in male paratypes to nearly that width). Ocelli distinct, 

 flattened surfaces of ocellar areas slanting rather strongly mesad, 

 very slightly more so than in rufa. Maxillary palpi rather short. 

 Pronotum with discal sulci decided. Tegmina and wings elongate, 

 more so than in rufa, much as in I. angustifrons Hebard. Supra- 

 anal plate produced ; lateral margins weakly convergent, distal mar- 

 gin transverse, three-quarters length of plate; surface subchitinous 

 in a large transverse oval, just proximad of distal margin; ventral 

 surface with very short, stout bristles, near sinistral margin and on 

 a moderately prominent convex area adjacent to the dextral margin 

 of the subchitinous area. Paired plate beneath supra-anal plate spe- 

 cialized : at base of sinistral style produced mesad in a chitinous re- 

 curved spine, the dorso-proximal portion of which is subchitinous; 

 at base of dextral style produced mesad in a heavy shafted, chitinous 

 spine, over twice as long, directed caudad and then curving broadly 

 inward to its aciculate apex. Titillator with apex similarly special- 



93 Though the female supra-anal plate varies in having the lateral margins 

 straight convergent to rather broadly concave convergent in rufa (upon which 

 apparent difference was based Saussure 's consobrina, a synonym of rufa occi- 

 dentalis Saussure), the lateral emargination of this plate shown by females of 

 argentina is of a different quality and much more decided than is shown by any 

 of tbe large series of the females of the races of rufa before us.

ized to that of rufa, but shorter and proportionately broader. Sub- 

 genital plate strongly asymmetrical as characteristic of genus, much 

 as in rufa except that the larger style is slightly heavier, less than 

 three times as broad as long and not twice as long (varying in the 

 series to nearly twice as long) as the unarmed sinistral style. 

 Allotype: 9 ; same data as type. [Hebard Collection.] 

 Similar to male in ambisexual characters except those of color- 

 ation. Size larger, form appreciably broader with pronotum more 

 ample. Head with interocular space slightly narrower, (varying 

 in the series to slightly wider) than that between the ocelli. Pro- 

 notum with discal sulci weak. Tegmina and wings broader than 

 in male, surpassing the cereal apices (to different degrees in the 

 series but never by as much as in the opposite sex). Supra-anal 

 plate with lateral portions of free margin very strongly convergent 

 and broadly convex to median produced portion, this portion with 

 margin convex, nearly forming a semicircle (one paratype shows 

 slightly greater convexity at the apex than elsewhere in the margin 

 of the produced portion). Subgenital plate convex, free margin 

 broadly convex, except below cerci, where it is broadly concave.

than the more uniformly colored males. As a result, there is a color 

 contrast between the sexes, a condition which does not occur in 

 rufa. In the maximum intensive female (Carcarafia) the vertex 

 to below the ocelli is rich deep chestnut brown. The pronotum is 

 similarly colored, becoming almost black in the mesal portion. The

This diminutive species would appear to be a paler and smaller

the small species of the genus, particularly distinctive in having the 

 styles of the male subgenital plate simple, straight, cylindrical and 

 virtually unarmed. 



As we have elsewhere noted, a great number of small species of 

 the genus exist, divisible by color features and pattern into only 

 a few very large groups. The specialization of the male genitalia 

 is distinctive in these species, often showing an astonishingly in- 

 tricate development. Females are ,however, exceedingly difficult 

 ot separate and should never be recorded as this or that species 

 without the aid of some definite sex correlation.

 base of the sinistral cercus; with a large, heavy tuft of agglutinated, 

 chaetiform spines, which curve sinistrad, situated a brief distance

 in marginal field; veins not darkened. Wings transparent, even 

 more weakly tinged with the same coloration, area of costal veins 

 not darkened. Dorsal surface of abdomen buffy proximad, marbled 

 with cinnamon-brown meso-distad, solidly cinnamon-brown distad. 

 Cerci cinnamon-brown, becoming slightly paler distad. Limbs 

 ochraceous-buff, the spines ochraceous-tawny. Ventral surface 

 of abdomen cinnamon-brown. 



The Paraguayan male is slightly darker, the pronotal suffusion 

 slightly heavier and the proximal portions of the tegmina more 

 strongly tinged with ochraceous-tawny. 



Length of body 100 9.3-9.5, length of pronotum 2.4-2.4, width of 

 pronotum 3-3.1, length of tegmen 9-9.2, width of tegmen 2.9-3 mm. 



In addition to the type, a paratypic male from Sapucay, Paraguay, 

 collected in October, by W. T. Foster and belonging to the United 

 States National Museum, has been studied. 101 



Ischnoptera saussurei 10 new species. Plate XI, figures 9 and 10. 



It is certain that Saussure 's Blatta fusca, described in 1869, 103 

 represents this or a closely related species. That name is preoccup- 

 ied by Blatta fusca Thunberg, 1784. As a result we here describe 

 saussurei in full, the insect requiring a new name if not actually re- 

 presenting a new species. 104 The importance of the male genitalic 

 development was not recognized at the time Saussure described 

 fusca and it will, as a result, be necessary to examine the type be- 

 fore that name can be definitely placed. 



The present species agrees closely with/, icano here described on

104 Rehn suggested that fusca might prove to be a synonym of I. marginata 

 (Brunner) before the now large series of this section of the genus in the unstudied 

 collections had been assembled. At that time it was supposed that the number 

 of species, included in this section of the genus Ischnoptera, was much smaller 

 than we now know to exist. Proc. Acad. Nat . Sci. Phila., 1915, p. 272, footnote 4.

Type: cf; Carcarafia, Santa Fe, Argentina. [Hebard Collection, 

 Type no. 752.] 



Size small, form moderately slender. Interocular space, ocellar 

 areas, maxillary palpi, intercalated triangle of wings, dorsal surface 

 of abdomen, titillator, armament of limbs, pulvilli, tarsal claws and 

 arolia as described for icano. Latero-caudal sulci of pronotal disk 

 moderately decided. Tegmina and wings fully developed, extend- 

 ing considerably beyond the cereal apices. Supra-anal plate sym- 

 metrical, two-fifths as long as basal width, brief lateral margins 

 nearly straight and almost transverse to within cereal bases, the 

 remaining produced portion symmetrically trapezoidal with angles 

 broadly rounded, its surface broadly convex, weakly chitinous meso- 

 distad, the latero-caudal angles thickened and well-supplied on 

 their ventral surfaces with spiniform hairs directed cephalad, the 

 dextral margin of this production mesad produced ventrad in a 

 large, rounded lobe, its caudal margin also supplied with spiniform 

 hairs directed meso-caudad. Within the anal chamber the socket 

 of the sinistral cercus is produced mesad in a minute conical pro- 

 jection; adjacent to the dextral cercus the corresponding section 

 is produced in a slender finger, which is directed mesad and then 

 curves, with considerable angulation, ventrad, its apex armed with 

 a few very minute spines. Paired plates beneath supra-anal plate 

 developed into large lobes, the sinistral plate extending two-thirds 

 the distance to the dextral cercus but more irregular and not as 

 strongly or evenly swollen as in icano. Subgenital plate with sur- 

 face supplied rather heavily with microscopic hairs, strongly convex, 

 free margin thickened sinistro-proximad and lying just outside the 

 sinistral cereal base, briefly inbent dextro-proximad beneath the 

 dextral cercus, sinistral margin very broadly concave and showing 

 very weak obliquity to the dextral style, which is situated a brief 

 distance mesad of the cercus, dextral margin broadly convex to 

 dextral style, where it forms an acute angulation, being very briefly 

 directed caudad to base of the style. Dextral style heavy, curving 

 sinistrad from its thickened base, two and one-half times as long as 

 its basal width, tapering to its blunt apex, with entire dorsal sur- 

 face thickly supplied with minute spines. Sinistral style on sinistral 

 margin a distance equal to its basal width from dextral style, taper- 

 ing and curved weakly dextrad beyond its slightly thickened base, 

 only slightly shorter but decidedly less heavy than dextral style 

 and unarmed. 105

space four-fifths as wide as that between the slightly less prominent 

 ocelli, but fully two-thirds that between the antennal sockets. 

 Supra-anal plate half as long as distance between cereal bases, pro- 

 duced and nearly semicircular between these, subchitinous in dis- 

 tal portions. Subgenital plate short, rather decidedly convex, free 

 margin broadly and nearly evenly convex. 



Coloration as described for icano. The male type has the medio- 

 longitudinal paler streak of the pronotum even more suffused, 

 while the allotype has this marking nearly obliterated. In the male 

 type the coxae are less darkened and the tegmina are more evenly 

 suffused, while in the female allotype the coloration is darker. 

 These features are due to intensification and recession in coloration 

 and it would appear that in color features saussurei and icano are 

 similar.

Ischnoptera icano new species. Plate XI, figures 11, 12 and 13. 



This species is very closely related to I. saussurei here described, 

 showing, however, distinctive features in the male genitalia. 



Of the small brown species of the genus, with pronotum margined 

 laterad and cephalad with buffy, five distinct species are before us 

 from the Argentine and Paraguay. Recent studies have shown 

 that an enormous number of forms belonging to this section of the 

 genus occur in tropical and subtropical America, frequently separ- 

 able on male genitalic characters alone, these parts, however, often 

 showing an intricacy of specialization of astounding degree. 



Type: c? ; Border of Rio Salado, near Icano, Santiago del Estero, 

 Argentina. [Paris Museum.] 



Size small, form moderately slender. Interocular space moderate- 

 ly broad, four-fifths as wide as that between the large ocelli, nearly 

 half that between the antennal sockets. Flattened surfaces of 

 ocellar areas forming a rather blunt angle with the interocellar area. 

 Maxillary palpi short, fifth joint very slightly longer than third, the 

 fourth two-thirds as long as the third joint. Latero-caudal sulci 

 of pronotal disk very decided. Microscopic hairs scattered over 

 lateral portions of pronotum and proximal portions of tegmina. 

 Tegmina and wings fully developed, extending a short distance be- 

 yond apices of cerci. Wings with a moderately well-developed 

 intercalated triangle. Dorsal surface of abdomen specialized as 

 is characteristic of the genus, eighth tergite with caudal margin

rather strongly concave. Supra-anal plate nearly symmetrical, 

 slightly over half as long as basal width, brief lateral margins weakly 

 convex and almost transverse to median produced portion; this 

 portion strongly convex, the convexity extending to the base of the 

 plate, the free lateral margins consequently curled downward, round- 

 ing distad into the transverse, subchitinous distal margin, this por- 

 tion as long as its basal width, tapering evenly and gently distad 

 where it is supplied with a few, elongate, scattered hairs; ventral 

 surface unspecialized but furnished thickly at the disto-lateral 

 rounded angles of the produced portion with minute spiniform 

 hairs, these slightly the heavier on the dextral side and there ex- 

 tending to the base of the produced portion. Within the anal cham- 

 ber, adjacent to the sinistral cercus, the socket is developed in a 

 minute rounded lip without production, adjacent to the dextral 

 cercus the corresponding section is produced in a triangular pro- 

 jection, twice as long as its basal width, the caudal surface of which 

 is very deeply concave. Paired plates beneath supra-anal plate 

 developed into large lobes, apparently unarmed; the sinistral plate 

 expanding mesad into a very large rounded lobe, which extends 

 two-thirds the distance to the dextral cercus. Titillator with apex 

 simple, aciculate. Subgenital plate strongly convex, with surface 

 supplied rather heavily with microscopic hairs, lateral margins con- 

 sequently dorsal in position, straight produced, then curving broadly 

 ventrad, so that the margin beyond in dorsal aspect is transverse; 

 internal surface toward free margins and styles as hairy as external 

 surface. Sinistral style a stout, straight, cylindrical process, tap- 

 ering, slightly shorter than dextral style. Dextral style heavier, 

 springing from a minute offset of the margin, curved weakly sinis- 

 trad with a weak median angulation, proximal half stout and 

 slightly tapering, distal half more strongly tapering to the apex, 

 which, like the dorsal portion of the distal half, is armed with min- 

 ute spines. Armament of limbs as characteristic of the genus. 

 Four proximal tarsal joints supplied ventro-distad with small but 

 readily observed pulvilli. Moderately well developed arolia pre- 

 sent between the bases of the slender, simple, symmetrical tarsal 

 claws. 



Head auburn, shading to buffy on mouthparts; ocelli warm buff. 

 Antennae buffy proximad, shading rapidly to dresden brown. Dis- 

 tal joint of palpi prouts brown. Pronotum shining, auburn, with 

 a medio-longitudinal suffused tawny line and cephalic and lateral 

 margins narrowly translucent buffy, caudal margin tawny, these 

 paler marginal portion not sharply defined. Tegmina translucent, 

 light chestnut brown with costal field dark chestnut brown in inner 

 half and warm buff in half toward costal margin, costal veins dis- 

 tinctly darker than intervening areas. Wings very weakly suffused 

 with brown, area of costal veins darker, particularly the veins them- 

 selves. Dorsal surface of abdomen buffy proximad, the greater 

 portion laterad and distad chestnut brown. Cerci chestnut brown. 




278 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART II 



Cephalic coxae proximad and proximal half of median and caudal 

 coxae blackish chestnut brown, remaining portions of limbs buffy 

 with spines tawny. Ventral surface of abdomen chestnut brown, 

 shading to ochraceous-tawny meso-proximad. 



It is to be noted that the coloration of I. panamae Hebard, I. 

 tolteca Saussure and /. nana Saussure and Zehntner, shows close 

 agreement to that of this species.

 Pseudischnoptera rhabdota 107 new species. Plate XI. figures 15, 16 and 17. 



This handsome insect is structurally very similar to P. lineata 

 (Olivier) ; differing only in the narrower interocular space, the very 

 broadly and weakly convex pronotal disk, which is fiat in that spec- 

 ies, and specialization of the meso-distal portion of the male supra- 

 anal plate. The coloration and color-pattern of tegmina and wings 

 is very distinctive in this insect, however, and very different from 

 the striking type shown by lineata.

tal margin. Pronotum with disk broadly and very weakly convex, 

 the comparatively narrow lateral portions weakly declivent; pro- 

 notum triangular in shape with angles broadly rounded ; the lateral 

 margins diverging from the head to the latero-caudal angles, these 

 and the transverse caudal margin nearly straight, very feebly con- 

 vex; greatest width at latero-caudal angles. Tegmina and wings 

 fully developed, extending well beyond cereal apices, narrower but 

 showing similar venation to those of the species of Nyctibora. Dor- 

 sal surface of abdomen with median segment showing transverse 

 median depression, formed by the fusion of two circular depressions, 

 this depression partially filled with a pale substance which, in drying, 

 has become hard, like shellac. Fourth, sixth, and eighth tergites, with 

 latero-caudal angles alone produced and rounded. Supra-anal 

 plate bluntly triangularly produced, median portion depressed, 

 this area forming a distal longitudinal subchitinous area terminated 

 distad as the broadly convex apex of the plate, the chitinous portion 

 on each side terminating in a large, stout, straight, elongate spine, 

 directed caudad. 10S Subgenital plate deplanate, with lateral por- 

 tions narrowly bent dorsad as far as insertion of styles, the lateral 

 portions straight in ventral aspect and moderately convergent to 

 the broad and very weakly convex apex; sinistral style proximad, 

 springing from a point beneath base of sinistral cercus, straight, 

 cylindrical, tapering to its rounded apex and slightly over three 

 times as long as its basal width, lying along margin of plate; dextral 

 style springing from dextro-distal angle, similar, but only half as 

 large and only slightly over twice as long as its basal width, like- 

 wise lying along margin of plate. Cephalic femora armed in dis- 

 tal third of cephalic margin with (five to ten in the series) small, 

 stout spines, terminating in three large spines, more elongate in in- 

 creasing ratio distad ; ventro-caudal margin armed in corresponding 

 portion with (three or four) heavy, elongate spines. Ventro- 

 cephalic margins of other femora armed only distad with (one to 

 five in the series) small, stout, irregular spines; ventro-caudal mar- 

 gins well-supplied with stout and elongate spines. Caudal metatar- 

 sus unarmed; four proximal tarsal joints supplied with large pul- 

 villi. Large chitinous arolia present between the nearly symmetri- 

 cal, simple tarsal claws. Important features of coloration given 

 below. 



Allotype: 9 ; same data as type. [Paris Museum.] 

 Agrees closely with male except in the following characters. 

 Eyes smaller, but with interocular space no wider. Pronotum 

 broader, with lateral margins slightly more convex. Tegmina and 

 wings reduced, reaching meso-distal portion of abdomen. Abdo- 

 men with dorsal surface unspecialized. Supra-anal plate hairy, 

 half as long as width between cerci, produced between these, the

 broadly convex between these points. 



Coloration of sexes similar. Entire insect shining blackish brown, 

 except as follows. Eyes tawny olive, ocellar spots buffy. Ant- 

 ennae and limbs paling to chestnut brown distad. Pronotum mar- 

 gined cephalad and laterad with a band of warm buff, this band

 ginal field warm buff, the cingulate margin blackish brown paling 

 to ochraceous-tawny distad; humeral trunk suffused with blackish 

 brown in proximal two-thirds, remaining portions ochraceous- 

 tawny with interval between costal veins and veins of anal and 

 proximal portion of discoidal field buffy. Frequent individuals are 

 more strongly ferruginous in area between the humeral trunk and 

 sutural margin of the tegmina. Wings transparent, anterior field 

 tinged with ochraceous-tawny, the veins and entire area of costal 

 veins of this color; radiate field weakly tinged with ochraceous-

 mature stage. The immature individual before us has the prono- 

 tum marked as in the adults, the mesonotum and metanotum 

 bordered laterad more broadly with buffy, each of these areas 

 crossed by a band of blackish brown, the four larger abdominal 

 tergites with an elongate, narrow, longitudinal marking on each 

 side of buffy, the immediate lateral margins being dark.

282 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART II 



This species has been assigned to the genera Calolampra and 

 Audreia, due mainly to the fact that the type female had short 

 truncate tegmina. Though this is true for the female sex, the male 

 before us is seen to have fully developed organs of flight, and shows 

 no characters which would warrant its being placed other than in 

 the genus Epilampra. The sexual diversity here shown is seen to 

 be in a way intermediate between that found in E. jorgenseni 

 (Rehn) 109 and the usual condition in the genus in which the sexes agree 

 closely. 



The female before us agrees closely with Saussure's figure, 110 ex- 

 cept in being more reddish, the ground coloration of pronotum and 

 tegmina being ochraceous-buff, tinged with ochraceous-tawny. 



The male shows the correctness of the sex association particularly 

 in many of the delicate features of color-pattern. As it had not 

 been previously recognized, we give the following data as to the 

 coloration of this sex. 



Head light ochraceous-buff, occiput with four irregular, vertical, 

 linear suffusions of blackish brown, below these a patch as long as 

 wide, of blackish brown. 111 Antennae ochraceous-buff. Pronotum 

 light ochraceous-buff, with very many microscopic dots of prouts 

 brown, numerous larger though minute dots and a delicate, inter- 

 rupted lyrate discal pattern of blackish brown. Tegmina trans- 

 parent light ochraceous-buff, with numerous minute dots (which 

 become smaller distad) and a few flecks of blackish brown, humeral 

 trunk blackish brown to nearly opposite apex of anal field. Limbs 

 light ochraceous-buff; femora margined dorsad with blackish brown, 

 a narrow medio-longitudinal weak suffusion on the cephalic face, 

 both faces with a heavy blackish brown suffusion disto-ventrad ; 

 tibiae dark brown in entire ventral half; distal portions of tarsal 

 joints suffused with dark brown. 



In the female the abdomen has the caudal margins of the tergites 

 regularly marked with small longitudinal patches of blackish brown, 

 which do not project. 112 



Length of body cf 20, 9 21.7; length of pronotum cf 5.7, 9 6.1; 

 length of tegmen cf 24, 9 7.1 113 ; width of tegmen cf 6, 9 5.5;

110 Mem. l'Hist. Nat. Mex., Ill, pi. II, fig. 24. 



111 In the female this patch is more extensive, fusing with the occipital lines 

 dorsad. 



112 Saussure describes these as "saiilies", this may be in error, as our specimens 

 agrees with the description very closely in all other respects. Many species of the 

 genus have longitudinal projections in place of the markings shown by the ex- 

 ample before us.

The female recorded by Rehn from Para, Brazil, as this insect, 

 represents a distinct species, having in that sex transversely truncate 

 tegmina and immaculate tibiae. 



Epilampra berlandi 114 new species. Plate XII, figures 1 and 2. 



This handsome little insect is one of the smaller species of the 

 genus, showing in the male sex affinity to the larger, but in general 

 similarly colored, males of E. jorgenseni (Rehn). 115 Compared with 

 the male of that species, the present males are found to differ in the 

 decidedly smaller size, wider interocular space, less produced caudal 

 portion of pronotum, less diaphanous tegmina, with much more 

 numerous and smaller maculations and darker wings, with area of 

 costal veins opaque and very dark. Considering the affinity to 

 jorgenseni, we believe that the female of this species will also be 

 found to differ very greatly from the male. 



The size, rather depressed form, grayish coloration and shape 

 and marking of the tegmina give the species a much closer super- 

 ficial resemblance to certain North American species of the Poly- 

 phagid genus A renivaga than is shown by any of the other known 

 species of Epilampra. 



Type: c? ; Icano, Santiago del Estero, Argentina. December. 

 [Paris Museum.] 



Size rather small, form depressed for the genus. Head very 

 slightly projecting beyond the pronotum, considerably depressed; 

 interocular space nearly twice the occipital ocular depth; ocelli very 

 large. Pronotum of the type characteristic for the genus, the sur- 

 face more flattened and production caudad weaker than is usual, 

 agreeing closely with that of jorgenseni except in these respects. 

 Tegmina extending beyond apex of abdomen slightly more than 

 pronotal length, moderately broad, the median half subequal in 



114 Named in honor of Monsieur Lucien Berland, of the Paris Museum, through 

 whose kind cooperation the present collections have been put in our hands for 

 study. 



116 A detailed comparison of the type of Rhicnoda jorgenseni Rehn, a female, 

 (described from the Misiones, Argentina, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1913, p. 

 277, fig. 1) and males, including the type of Epilampra stigmatiphora Rehn, 

 (described from the Misiones, Argentina, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1913, p. 

 279, fig. 2) convinces us that but a single species is represented, of which the 

 sexes are widely dissimilar. The males show no features which would warrant 

 generic separation from the other species of Epilampra. The female, however, is 

 a patelliform type, evidently retaining in the adult numerous features character- 

 istic of the early stages and having tegmina alone represented by small, lateral, 

 triangular pads. As a result the species is recognized as Epilampra jorgenseni 

 (Rehn), the first species of the genus known to show wide dissimilarity in the sexes.

 rather broad, opaque; ulnar vein with (seven) incomplete and (two) 

 complete branches. Abdomen strongly depressed. Supra-anal 

 plate bilobate, with apices rather sharply rounded, length two-thirds 

 distance between cerci. Cerci small, tapering distad, with apical 

 portion very slender. Subgenital plate as characteristic of genus; 

 moderately asymmetrical, lobate; styles very small, straight, simple. 

 Armament of limbs (except that, as in jorgenseni, the ventro- 

 cephalic margin of the cephalic femora is armed with one, instead 

 of the usual two, heavy distal spines), pulvilli and arolia as charact- 

 eristic of Epilampra. 



Head cream color, the occiput obscurely striate vertically with 

 buffy, with a broad interocular band of blackish mummy brown, 

 which sends a ray ventrad along the ventral margin of each ocellus. 

 Eyes mummy brown. Underparts warm buff, limbs light och- 

 raceous-buff. Pronotum cream color, rather thickly and very 

 minutely dotted with mummy brown, these dots enlarging slightly 

 mesad and forming minute longitudinal maculae on the margin of 

 the caudal production, the disk further marked with minute flecks 

 of prouts brown. All of the pronotal markings are so small that 

 it appears merely more strongly suffused mesad, without noticeable 

 picturing, the sublyrate median pattern being even more obscure 

 than in jorgenseni. Tegmina with marginal field opaque, cream 

 color, with very few punctae of mummy brown; other portions trans- 

 lucent, tinged with saccardos umber and thickly flecked with 

 mummy brown, with a few larger flecks meso-distad; humeral trunk 

 to near end of marginal field heavily suffused with mummy brown. 

 Area of dextral tegmen, concealed when at rest, bister, flecked only 

 in its inner portion. Wings with area of costal veins opaque, bister 

 with immediate margin slightly paler, beyond thiswith a few mar- 

 ginal flecks of bister; other portions transparent, tinged with bistre, 

 the veins bister. Dorsal surface of abdomen clay color, shading 

 to bister distad. 



Length of body 116 15.7-15.7, length of pronotum 4.3^4.4, width 

 of pronotum 5.6-5.8, length of tegmen 15.9-16, width of tegmen 

 5.6-5.6 mm. 



In addition to the type, a single paratypic male bearing the same 

 data, two immature males and one immature female from Cruz 

 del Eje, Cordoba, Argentina, in the Hebard Collection, are before 

 us.

This species appears to be extremely close to T. conspurcatum

 it would appear to differ in the unicolorous black antennae, and in 

 pronotum, the proportions of which are given as 4 by 5.6 millimeters.

117 We here select La Plata, Argentina, as the type locality of this species. It is 

 closely related to P. cubensis Saussure and, in the very large series of the genus be- 

 fore us, is recognizable only from material from Paraguay and northern Argentina. 

 The Santa Catharina record may, therefore, represent the same species, but we 

 are confident that that from Guatemala is based on either a misidentification or 

 material incorrectly labelled.

BLABERINAE. 

 Blaptica interior new species. Plate XIV, figure 1. 



This species is very closely related to B. dubia (Serville), differing 

 in the male sex in the more slender form, in the strikingly smaller 

 pronotum, with lateral portions of cephalic margins not weakly 

 refiexed and lateral margins broadly rounded, showing hardly a 

 trace of the angulation distinctly developed (though to varying 

 degrees) in dubia, and in the narrower interocular space. In ad- 

 dition the ventral surface is paler, that surface with subgneital plate 

 and sometimes the preceding segment alone solidly dark, while the 

 dark marking of the pronotal disk is truncate cephalad, ceasing 

 abruptly before the convex section above the head. 



Females of these species are very similar, those of interior being 

 less robust, with interval between the tegmina decidedly less. 



Type: d* ; Cordoba, Cordoba, Argentina. [Hebard Collection, 

 Type no. 672.] 



Size rather small for the genus, very small for the Blaberinae; 

 form slender for the genus. Interocular space narrower than in 

 dubia, one-third (varying in the series to two-fifths) as wide as the 

 interocellar space. Ocelli large and prominent, each with a cir- 

 cular and similarly subchitinous spot of about half the size immedi- 

 ately ventrad. Maxillary palpi with distal joint very slightly 

 longer than fourth. Pronotum with impressed lyrate pattern of 

 disk and convex area above head as in dubia, but differing decidedly 

 in the almost perfectly oval outline, without lateral angles and 

 weakly cingulate, but not moderately refiexed, lateral portions of 

 the cephalic margin. Tegmina elongate and narrow, with margins 

 parallel for a considerable distance; anal field ample and elongate, 

 as in dubia. Supra-anal plate broadly truncate, bilobate. Sub- 

 genital plate forming an asymmetrical lobe, with two very small, 

 simple styles. Ventro-cephalic margin of cephalic femora supplied 

 with a row of closely placed, moderately elongate, spiniform hairs, 

 terminating in a single large distal spine. 118 Other ventral femoral 

 margins (excepting in many paratypes the entirely unarmed ventro- 

 caudal of the caudal femora, and in this the normal condition in the 

 species) armed with a single large distal spine, the ventro-caudal 



118 This condition is also found in dubia, but in that species frequent specimens 

 have one or more short, heavy, proximal spines and two heavy spines distad on 

 the ventro-cephalic margin of the cephalic femur. Variation in that species is 

 decided, as will possibly be found to be true for interior also. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 287 



margins of the median and caudal femora supplied with elongate 

 hairs. Four proximal tarsal joints with large pulvilli, 119 that of the 

 metatarsus linear in large portion, running to the base; last (fifth; 

 joint with ventral surface subchitinous in a longitudinal, linear 

 area. Tarsal claws heavy, symmetrical, simple; arolium suggested 

 by a very minute chitinous convexity between their bases. 



Allotype: 9 ; Cruz del Eje, Cordoba, Argentina. [Hebard Col- 

 lection.] 



Very different in general appearance from male. Size larger, 

 form broader. Interocular space narrower than in dubia, though 

 much broader than in male, slightly narrower than that between 

 the somewhat less prominent ocelli. Pronotum larger, rather 

 strongly convex to the cingulate lateral margins, which meso- 

 cephalad are weakly and narrowly reflexed; margin nearly semi- 

 circular to the truncate caudal margin, the latter showing a sub- 

 obsolete convexity between the shoulders; latero-caudal angles 

 rectangulate and sharply rounded. Tegmina greatly reduced, ex- 

 tending caudad as far as (varying in the series to slightly beyond) 

 caudal margin of median segment, oblique truncate from bluntly 

 rounded apex to near base of sutural margin (often with section in 

 anal field less oblique and showing some convexity) ; unlike females 

 of dubia, separated by a very brief interval (varying to attingent in 

 the series) . Abdomen much larger and heavier in structure. Cerci 

 moniliform, very small, projecting only slightly beyond the abdo- 

 minal outline. Limbs and their armament and specialization simi- 

 lar to male, except that they aresomewhat shorter and heavier. 



Coloration of male. Head blackish liver brown, the ocelli 

 and subocellar areas, proximal antennal joint, palpi and mouth- 

 parts ochraceous-buff . Pronotum translucent ochraceous-buff ; disk 

 blackish prouts brown with flecks of ochraceous-buff mesad, 120 this 

 dark area spreading and including the shoulders and intervening 

 area caudad, becoming deep cinnamon-brown latero-caudad. Teg- 

 mina ochraceous-buff in proximal portion of anal field, all of mar- 

 ginal field and more narrowly distad on costal margin, humeral 

 trunk heavily suffused with blackish chestnut brown, this spread- 

 ing over all portions of the tegmina except those mentioned above, 

 but becoming dilute toward the sutural margin and distad. In one 

 paratype the entire anal field is pale, while in another the dark suf- 

 fusion is very weak everywhere except toward the humeral trunk. 

 Wings transparent, tinged with dresden brown in anterior field, 

 but opaque, buffy, in area of costal veins, faintly tinged with brown 



119 This and the following features we believe to be of generic rather than specific 

 value. 



120 In the series of paratypes there are individuals with disk lacking pale flecks 

 or showing one or two lateral linear flecks and a single mesal or meso-caudal fleck. 

 In the type there is an additional fleck mesad, while in other paratypes there is a 

 distinct lyrate area of this paler coloration. Intensification and recession of 

 color pattern account for these differences.

in radiate field, veins prouts brown. Dorsal surface of abdomen 

 weakly mottled tawny olive, laterad rather broadly margined on 

 each side with pinkish buff. Underparts and limbs ochraceous-buff , 

 spines blackish becoming russet proximad. Ventral surface of 

 abdomen with each segment flecked laterad with blackish prouts 

 brown, the subgenital plate and meso-caudal portion of preceding 

 sternite entirely of this color, the preceding sternites washed weakly 

 laterad and in an obscure transverse median band with prouts brown. 



In the females the coloration is generally similar, the exposed dor- 

 sal surface of the abdomen ochraceous-buff, often tinged with 

 tawny, each segment heavily marked with blackish brown except 

 laterad and caudad, frequently with patches mesad on each side 

 and along the median line of the paler coloration, so that in such ex- 

 amples the abdomen shows five distinct longitudinal, pale, inter- 

 rupted bands. 



For purposes of comparison the measurements, in millimeters, 

 for interior and dubia are given in the following table.

The series shows no very decided intensification or recession of 

 color pattern. The paler individuals, however, do not have the 

 pronotal maculation solidly dark; in some, paired buffy flecks occur, 

 in occasional females the face-like marking, developed in certain 

 species of Blaberus is shown, while in some males a blurred lyrate 

 pattern is developed.

The species has previously been recorded from Argentina only 

 from Jujuy, in the province of the same name. 



Considerable color variation is shown by the series. In one male 

 and the three females, the dark pronotal marking spreads caudad, 

 covering the shoulders; in but one of these specimens do pale points 

 show mesad in this dark area. In the males the most recessive 

 specimen shows a short medio-longitudinal pale streak and latero- 

 caudad of it two large oblique flecks of the same color in this area. 

 In one male with perfectly shield-shaped pronotal marking, this 

 area is solidly dark. In all, the dark pronotal area is terminated 

 by the caudal margin of the pronotum. 



Eublaberus argentinus new species. Plate XIV, figure 8. 



This species appears to be nearest E. immacula (Saussure and 

 Zehntner), described from a female from Pernambuco, Brazil. 




1921J NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 291 



The female at hand differs from the description of that species 

 in the somewhat smaller size, with pronotum solidly suffused, leav- 

 ing only the lateral marginal portions pale and buffy, not rufescent. 



We have found that the species of Eublaberus are separable almost 

 entirely on features of coloration and color pattern. We know that 

 coloration is, as a rule, though by no means invariably, unsafe for 

 diagnostic purposes, while color pattern is often subject to decided 

 variation, particularly when marked individual recession or intensi- 

 fication occurs. Thus, in E. posticus (Erichson) and E. biolleyi (Rehn), 

 the coior pattern is decidedly affected by the latter factor, the gen- 

 eral type remaining the same. 



In argentinus we have a form showing the maximum extension 

 of the pronolal dark marking. Recessive examples will probably 

 show reduction of this marking, but we feel satisfied that the mate- 

 rial before us does not represent merely an intensive condition of 

 some other described species and we are of the opinion that the 

 pattern shown by less heavily marked individuals of argentinus will 

 exhibit distinctive features.

Size and form, average for the genus. Head with interocular 

 space slightly narrower than that between the moderately large 

 ocelli, three-fifths as wide as that between the antennal sockets. 

 Antennae incrassate, moderately pilose. Pronotum with a distinct, 

 rounded angulation at point of greatest width meso-cephalad. Teg- 

 mina and wings fully developed, extending beyond the apex of the 

 abdomen a distance approximating the pronotal length. Supra- 

 anal plate delicate, bilobate. Subgenital plate simple, large and 

 chitinous. Ventro-cephalic margin of cephalic femora with (3 to 

 4) proximal and (1 or 2) distal heavy spines, between which is a 

 fringe of elongate hairs. Ventro-cephalic margin of median and 

 caudal femora armed with a single heavy distal spine. Ventro- 

 caudal margin of cephalic and median femora armed with two 

 heavy, closely placed distal spines. Ventro-caudal margin of med-

 of caudal femora unarmed. Median and caudal femora with a 

 heavy, elongate genicular spine. Caudal metatarsus unarmed 

 ventrad, with a large pulvillus, rounded distad, linear and running 

 to near base of this joint; three succeeding tarsal joints with large 

 pulvilli. Tarsal claws simple, symmetrical. Arolia absent. 



Head and antennae chestnut brown, eyes prouts brown, ocelli 

 and mouth-parts ochraceous-buff. Pronotum almost solidly black- 

 ish chestnut brown, the moderately broad lateral marginal portions 

 apricot yellow. In the less intensively ^colored paratype the pro-

notum is chestnut brown, deepening to blackish along caudal mar- 

 gin, with flecks of the same latero-cephalad and slightly paler, ap- 

 proaching tawny, in large median portion of this dark area, which 

 runs to the cephalic margin above the head, leaving only the moder- 

 ately broad lateral marginal portions ochraceous-buff. Tegmina 

 transparent, light ochraceous-buff, humeral trunk chestnut brown 

 to slightly beyond forking of mediastine vein, the humeral vein dark- 

 ened a brief distance beyond, other veins very weak ochraceous- 

 tawny. Dorsal surface of abdomen buckthorn brown shading to dres- 

 den brown distad on each tergite, broadly margined laterad and all 

 but meso-proximal portion of supra-anal plate ochraceous-buff tinged 

 with buckthorn brown. Ventral surface chestnut brown and buffy, 

 ochraceous-tawny with buffy maculations in paratype, ventral sur- 

 face of abdomen apricot yellow and broadly bordered with chestnut 

 brown, this including all but a median fleck on the subgenital plate, 

 the other sternites very narrowly margined laterad with buffy, in 

 the paratype ochraceous-tawny, the darker lateral markings more 

 suffused and breaking laterad into buffy areas on the proximal ster- 

 nites. Limbs brussels brown, margins brown in paratype; the 

 spines darker and more reddish. 



The measurements for the two females are as follows, those of 

 the type being given first. Length of body 34.7-36.3, width of

 costal veins clubbed distad, ulnar vein unbranched, intercalated 

 triangle moderately large, radiate field folding fan-wise. Dorsal 

 surface of abdomen with median segment specialized mesad. Sub- 

 genital plate asymmetrical, but not as strongly so as in Ceuthobiella 

 and of a distinct general type. Ventro-cephalic margin of cephalic

Ceuthobia lepta 124 new species. Plate XIII, figures 5 and 6. 



Males of the present species are recognizable by their slender form, 

 weak pilosity of head, pronotum and tegmina, elongate tegmina 

 with numerous costal veins, armed caudal femora and specialization 

 of the subgenital plate. 



The general type of the latter feature is much as in C. fulvella

 gins supplied with hairs and distad with one, but no distal, slender, 

 chaetiform spine. Caudal femora with ventro-cephalic margin armed 

 distad with three, but no distal, well-developed though slender spines, 

 ventro-caudal margin armed distad with two similar spines. Geni- 

 cular spines of median and caudal femora small and very slender. 

 Caudal metatarsus slightly longer than combined length of succeeding

The present specimens are so much smaller than the type that 

 we at first believed a distinct species to be represented. Careful 

 examination shows, however, that no feature of sufficient impor- 

 tance occurs to warrant separation. 



The specialization of the median segment of the male abdomen 

 is the same as described for C. lepta on page 294. The male sub- 

 genital plate was not originally described. It is asymmetrical, 

 with sinistral margin weakly oblique and feebly concave to beyond 

 the mesal point, supplied at end of proximal third with a minute, 

 simple, straight style, set in a socket; dextral margin almost straight, 

 produced, showing slight convexity distad and there terminating at 

 apex of plate in a large socket, in which is set the dextral style; 

 this style rounded, with a slender, elongate spine dextrad which 

 curves sinistrad and at its base sinistro-caudad another similar spine 

 of about half the length. The material here recorded agrees with 

 the type in this and all other features, except size and a very slightly 

 greater interocular width. 



Length of body 5.5-6, length of pronotum 1.3-1.3, width of 

 pronotum 1.8-1.8, length of tegmen 5.9-6.2, width of tegmen 1.85- 

 1.9 mm. 



LANTA new genus. 



This genus includes two previously unknown Argentinian species. 

 Nearest relationship is with Ceuthobia, males agreeing in the small 

 size, moderately wide and not wrinkled interocular area, compara- 

 tively large ocellar areas, general form and contour of pronotum, 

 sinistral tegmen without a diagonal channel, generally longitudinal 

 character of discoidal sectors, wings of similar general proportions 

 with radiate field folding fan-wise, absence of pulvilli and presence 

 of well developed arolia. 



It differs in the more regular tegminal venation with discoidal 

 sectors all parallel to each other but weakly oblique to the sutural 

 margin, wings with more numerous costal veins which are thickened 

 (not clubbed) distad, smaller intercalated triangle, unspecialized

dorsal surface of male abdomen, different character of specialization 

 of subgenital plate and more distinct limb spination. 126 



Genotype. â€” Lanta scotia new species. 



Generic Description. Size minute, form moderately broad, ellip- 

 tical; weakly convex surface polished, regularly but not thickly 

 clothed with silky, erect, pile. Head with occiput slightly roughened 

 and interocular area regularly and minutely pitted (from which 

 spring the minute hairs), but not decidedly and irregularly rugose 

 as in Melestora; interocular space wider than that between antennal 

 sockets. Ocelli comparatively large, flat surfaces of ocellar areas 

 forming a decided angle with plane of interocellar area. Pronotum 

 elliptical, showing very slight flattening of the curvature of the 

 latero-cephalic portions; surface convex, the lateral portions show- 

 ing marked deflection; latero-caudal sulci of disk represented by 

 broad and well defined concave areas, which diverge cephalad, the 

 intervening section evenly and weakly convex. Tegmina coriace- 

 ous, bluntly elongate elliptical, but shorter and broader than in 

 the related genera, width nearly subequal through mesal half, apex 

 broadly rounded; numerous costal veins very strongly oblique; anal 

 field elongate pyriform, anal sulcus distinct; discoidal sectors longi- 

 tudinal or nearly so, connected by moderately well-developed cross- 

 veinlets, which form regularly rectangulate interspaces. Wings 

 fully developed, exceedingly delicate; costal veins thickened except 

 near base; interval between median and discoidal veins broad, with 

 transverse veinlets; ulnar vein bifurcate; intercalated triangle small 

 but distinct; radiate field folding fan-wise. Dorsal surface of abdo- 

 men unspecialized. 



Cephalic femora with ventro-cephalic margin armed with a 

 single elongate spine, succeeded by a row of minute spiniform hairs, 

 terminated by one or two elongate spines. Other ventral femoral 

 margins, except the wholly unarmed ventro-caudal margin of the 

 cephalic femora, supplied with minute hairs but unarmed except 

 for a single elongate distal spine; median and caudal femora with 

 an elongate genicular spine. Caudal tarsus about three-quarters 

 as long as caudal tibia, succeeding joints three-quarters as long as 

 metatarsus, pilose but with ventral surfaces unspined. Pulvilli 

 absent. Arolia moderately large, extending to near apices of simple, 

 symmetrical tarsal claws. 



Lanta scotia 12 ' new species. Plate XIII, figures 7 and 8. 



This species and L. peniculiger, described on page 298, are quite 

 similar in general appearance. Known only from the male sex, 

 the diminutive individuals are of a solidly dark brown coloration, 



126 This is due to the fact that in the present genus the few heavier spines are 

 stout and the ventral femoral margins are not supplied with hairs which increase 

 n size to become slender spines distad, as is true for C. lepta here described. 



127 From okoziz = dark. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 297 



with tegmina comparatively broad and short, broadly rounded dis- 

 tad, with venation more regular than in the forms of nearest affinity. 



Compared with peniculiger, the present species differs in the 

 larger size, slightly less delicate character of wings and portion of 

 dextral tegmen concealed when at rest, dorsal surface of abdomen 

 without hairs and distinctive type of genitalic specialization. 



Type: o 71 ; Cordoba, Cordoba, Argentina. (F. Schulz.) [Hebard 

 Collection, Type no. 673.] 



In addition to the features given in the generic description, we 

 would note the following characters which appear to be of specific 

 value. Interocular space slightly wider than that between antennal 

 sockets and wider than the occipital depth of the large eyes by 

 about one-fourth. Distal joint of maxillary palpi as long as com- 

 bined length of second and third joints, expanding evenly to beyond 

 median point, thence with ventral margin oblique to the acute apex; 

 third joint very slightly longer than fourth. Costal veins of teg- 

 mina numerous (16 to 19, including mediastine vein and its branches) 

 discoidal sectors (5 to 7 in series) longitudinal, except in area be- 

 yond apex of anal field where three or four are weakly oblique. 

 Dorsal surface of abdomen without hairs. Supra-anal plate trans- 

 verse, free margin broadly and evenly convex. Paired plate be- 

 neath supra-anal plate with dextral portion developed ventrad 

 from beneath cercus in a slender, straight finger, directed meso- 

 dorsad and twice as long as the sinistral style, back of which is a 

 large plate, subchitinous in all but peripheral portion; sinistral 

 portion developed into a smaller though large chitinous lobe, which 

 tapers and curves dorsad to its acute apex. Subgenital plate asym- 

 metrical, sinistral margin weakly sinuous and very weakly oblique 

 to slightly beyond median point, with sinistral style mesad on this 

 margin, springing from a socket on the dorsal edge; dextral margin 

 more strongly oblique to just before median point, from the socketed 

 apex of the weak triangular production formed by these margins 

 springs the dextral style. Styles small, simple; the sinistral straight 

 two and one-half times as long as its basal width, tapering slightly 

 to the rounded apex; the dextral style heavier, blunter and shorter, 

 scarcely twice as long as its basal width, showing a slight curvature 

 ventrad and with dorsal surface thickly armed with very minute 

 spines. 



General coloration deep bister. Head blackish chestnut brown; 

 ocelli light buff, (type with ocelli discolored, dark) ; antennae, palpi 

 and mouthparts snuff brown. Pronotum deep bister. Tegmina 

 weakly transparent, heavily and evenly suffused with dresden 

 brown, except in portion of dextral tegmen, concealed when at rest, 

 which is transparent and very weakly suffused. Wings transparent, 

 colorless except in area of costal veins and distad in anterior field 

 where they are suffused with dresden brown. Dorsal surface of

abdomen cinnamon-buff, deepening to warm sepia distad, the supra- 

 anal plate of this color, the cerci snuff brown. Limbs and ventral 

 surface clay color, deepening to prouts brown distad on abdomen . 

 In some of the paratypes before us the limbs and ventral surface are 

 snuff brown, the latter becoming blackish toward the margins.

We give the following characters, supplementing those described 

 in the generic treatment. Size smaller, structure more delicate 

 than in scotia. Space between antennal sockets three-quarters as 

 wide as interocular space, the latter wider than the occipital depth 

 of the large eyes by slightly over one-fourth. Maxillary palpi as 

 described for scotia. Tegmina with numerous (15 and 16) costal 

 veins, discoidal sectors (4 and 5) longitudinal. Dorsal surface of 

 abdomen unspecialized, but with median segment supplied with a 

 number of very fine microscopic hairs in median portion, succeeding 

 tergites with fewer similar hairs mesad. Supra-anal plate trans- 

 verse, free margin laterad straight, oblique, mesad straight, trans- 

 verse in broad section, the angles thus formed rounded. Paired 

 plate beneath supra-anal plate with dextral portion developed into 

 a large plate extending to median line, subchitinous mesad, with a 

 minute projection mesad on its ventral margin; sinistral portion 

 as in scotia, developed into a smaller though large chitinous lobe, 

 which tapers and curves dorsad to its acute apex. Subgenital plate 

 asymmetrical, sinistral margin weakly convex and weakly oblique 

 to median point, with sinistral style just before that point; dextral 

 margin more strongly convex and oblique to median point, where 

 by a sudden small offset the juncture of these margins is formed, 

 the specialized dextral style projecting from this angulation, the

margins of which are subchitinous. Sinistral style simple, straight, 

 cylindrical, about four times as long as basal width, tapering to the 

 rounded apex; dextral style represented by a brush of agglutinated 

 spiniform hairs, nearly as wide as the length of the sinistral style, 

 the median length of these hairs slightly shorter than the width of 

 the brush, this brush springing from the dorsal surface of the plate 

 just within the free margin. 



General coloration deep bister. Head blackish chestnut brown; 

 ocelli light buff; proximal antennal joints, palpi and mouthparts 

 prouts brown, remaining portions of antennae buckthorn brown 

 tinged with tawny. Pronotum deep bister. Tegmina weakly 

 transparent, heavily and evenly suffused with saccardos umber, 

 except in portion of dextral tegmen concealed when at rest, which 

 is hyaline, transparent, the wing beneath showing whitish. Wings 

 transparent, almost colorless, except area of costal veins and dis- 

 tal margin of anterior field, where they are strongly suffused with 

 saccardos umber. Abdomen, underparts and limbs dresden brown, 

 the abdomen deepening to prouts brown distad. 



Length of body 6, length of pronotum 1.7, width of pronotum 2, 

 length of tegmen 5.9, width of tegmen 2.3, length of wing 5.5, width 

 of wing 3.7 mm. 



The type is unique.

REVISION OF W. M. GABB'S TERTIARY MOLLUSCA 

 OF SANTO DOMINGO. 



By Henry A. Pilsbry. 



The Tertiary beds of northern Santo Domingo were first brought 

 to scientific notice by the receipt in London of a collection of fossils 

 made by Mr. T. S.Heneken, 1 and described by J. Carriker Moore 

 and G. B. Sowerby. 2 Subsequently Mr. Heneken reported on the 

 geology and Mr. Moore on another sending of fossils. 3 The Hene- 

 ken collection also served as the basis of a paper by Mr. R. J. L. 

 Guppy, 4 describing further species, and for numerous notes in other 

 publications by the same author. 



William More Gabb, in the course of a geological reconnaissance 

 of Santo Domingo in the years 1869-1871, collected extensively 

 in and about the region covered by Mr Heneken 's work. His ob- 

 servations on the geology and descriptions of the fossils were pub- 

 lished by the American Philosophical Society, 5 and the fossils were 

 presented to The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. 

 Unfortunately, Gabbwas not able to figure his species. The de- 

 scriptions are not always sufficiently full to insure their recognition 

 when encountered in other beds except by reference to the original 

 specimens. The progress of tropical American paleontology ha? 

 undoubtedly been impeded by the uncertainty attaching to many 

 of Gabb's Santo Domingan species. 



A certain number of fossils of Santo Domingo and Haiti have 

 been described or discussed by Dr. W. H. Dall, in his great work on 

 the Tertiary fauna of Florida and in the Proceedings of the U. S. 

 National Museum. Others have been published by Dr. A. P. 

 Brown and the writer in papers on fossils of the Canal Zone, Col- 

 ombia, and Haiti. 



1 Mr. Heneken 's name was spelled Heniker in the original publication. 



2 Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, vol. vi, 1849. 



3 Same Journal, vol. ix, 1853. 



4 Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, vol. 32, 1876, pp. 516-532. 



5 Notes on the Topography and Geology of Santo Domingo. Trans. American 

 Philosophical Society, XV, pp. 49-259. Separate copies with special title-page 

 dated 1873. The exact date of publication remains uncertain. Dr. I. Minis 

 Hays, Secretary of the Society, informs me that the records of the Publication 

 Committee were not preserved; but a proof of Gabb's map was exhibited at the 

 meeting of October 2, 1873. The paper was reviewed in the American Journal of 

 Science for March, 1874. It may be inferred that the work was not actually dis- 

 tributed until late in 1873 or early in 1874. In the absence of proof to the con- 

 trary, the date of the title-page may be accepted. 



Gabb described the new genera and illustrated their type species in : Description 

 of some new genera of Mollusca. Proc. A. N. S. Phila. for 1872, pp. 270-274, pi. 

 9-11, published Feb. 11, 1873.

Some years ago Mr. Charles W. Johnson and the writer under- 

 took to supplement Gabb's work by the preparation of figures of 

 his type specimens with notes on these and other specimens con- 

 tained in his collection. The work was interrupted by Mr. John- 

 son 's removal to Boston, and its completion, devolving upon the 

 senior author alone, was delayed by the pressure of other duties. 

 The paper was finally submitted to the Academy for publication 

 February 27, 1917, 6 Under existing conditions prompt publication 

 could not then be made, so that an extract containing descriptions 

 of new species was published. 7 Meantime, Miss C. J. Maury had 

 issued the text of a report on the geology and paleontology of Santo 

 Domingo, 8 anticipating the appearance of our paper by a few days. 

 Having access to a partial set of Gabb's specimens, Miss Maury, 

 with great enterprise, anticipated our revision by renaming certain 

 of the Gabb species having invalid names, and described others 

 from his collection. In now publishing our notes and figures, such 

 synonymy as was obvious in' looking over Miss Maury's work has 

 been noted, and some paragraphs which now appear superfluous 

 have been deleted; otherwise the paper is left as originally written. 9 

 When a critical comparison of the Gabb and Maury specimens can 

 be made doubtless some further cases of identity will be apparent; 

 but it is clear that each collection contains many species not in the 

 other. It is an evidence of the remarkable richness of the faunas. 



Gabb had selected a type series of his fossils. In a few cases 

 which we have noted below, his trays contained more than one 

 form, but practically all of the species described by us as new were 

 shells which Gabb had determined incorrectly, others which he had 

 set aside as duplicates; or they were selected from packages which, 

 from their condition and the dates of newspapers used as wrappings, 

 apparently had not been opened since they were packed in Santo 

 Domingo.

 29, 1917. 



9 Certain recent changes in generic nomenclature might have been adopted, 

 but it seemed better to leave the latter uniform with our paper of 1917. The 

 valuable papers of C. W. Cooke, 1919, and B. Hubbard, 1920, were received 

 since this paper was completed. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 307 



With two exceptions 10 the species enumerated in Gabb 's paper 

 are furnished with labels (names only) in his hand, under card labels 

 written by Professor Heilprin ; all of the small species were in vials, 

 the large ones loose in the trays. We found no cases of trans- 

 position of specimens, and with two exceptions 11 every species or 

 specimen mentioned by Gabb has been found, together with its 

 proper label. 



With two or three exceptions, none of the labels bore any indi- 

 cations of locality or horizon further than "Santo Domingo." 

 What little information exists of more definite character is contained 

 in Gabb 's paper, or sometimes may be inferred from his specific 

 names. The zonal relations of many of the species have been deter- 

 mined by Miss Maury. 



In a few cases the gangue indicates that certain species are from 

 the Orthaulax zone, which is apparently synchronous with the Tampa 

 Silex beds, while the remainder so far as we can judge is later, having 

 much in common with the Gatun and Bowden beds, now generally 

 considered Miocene. This was also Gabb's opinion. 



Gabb 's descriptions give evidence of haste and the use of a lens 

 of low power only. Dimensions of the shells were often omitted, 

 and when given are almost invariably inexact, as though estimated 

 rather than actually measured. There are many typographical 

 errors, due to the circumstance that the paper was printed after his 

 departure for Costa Rica. He did not see the proofs. We note 

 these things merely to account for occasional discrepancies between 

 the original descriptions and the supplementary descriptive notes 

 to be found in this revision. 



Certain species not Santo Domingan have been named incident- 

 ally in the course of this work, as follows: 



Conus maculospira n.n. for planiliratus Sowerby. Recent. 



Conus consobrinus ultimus Pils. & Johns. Pliocene, Costa Rica. 



Conus pseudomarginatus, n. n. for C. marginatus Cossm., not 

 Sowb. Martinique. 



Xancus textilis jamaicensis. Bowden, Jamaica Miocene. 



Bursa crassa bowdenensis. Bowden, Miocene. 



Cyprcea raymondrobertsi bowdenensis. Bowden, Miocene. 



Pyramidella insularum, n. n. for P. canaliculata Sowb. Recent. 



10 u The specimens of TeUina alternala and T. vunicea (?) in the collection have 

 lost their labels; it is not certain that they are Gabb 's examples, or that the former 

 is from Santo Domingo.

This species is far more solid than C. bidentata (Orb.), and con- 

 stantly broader in a considerable series of both examined. For 

 comparison a figure is given of a specimen of C. bidentata measuring 

 length 3.7, diam. 1.9 mm., from Albatross Station 2275, off North 

 Carolina (Text-fig. 6).

 the young of this species. 



The genus Cylichnella has been subordinated to Cylichna by some 

 authors, to Tornalina by others; but it appears to us gen- 

 erically distinct from both, being distinguished from Cylichna by 

 characters of the columella and from Tornatina by the wholly

Minute Ringiculas, from 1.3 to 1.9 mm. long, are abundant in 

 the Santo Domingo material. In shape and sculpture they show 

 a good deal of diversity â€” forms like R. semilimata, R. guppyi, and 

 others; there maybe three or four species, as species go in this genus. 

 Without more extended study than we have time for, exact identi- 

 fications cannot be made. R. hypograpta Brn. & Pils., from the 

 Gatun formation, is another similar, but slightly larger, form.

 on the visible part of the penult whorl. The last whorl shows very 

 minute spiral striation under strong magnification, and there is an 

 inconspicuous groove on each side of the periphery, which shows no 

 trace of a keel. If present it must have been membranous. The 

 diameter, as broken, is 2.5 mm. 



Fig. 14. Atlanta cordiformis Gabb. Fig. 15. Atlanta rotundata Gabb. 



The rounded whorl, without peripheral keel, is similar to that 

 of Oxy gyrus, but the embryonic shell is that of Atlanta. It may 

 form a subgenus of Atlanta to be called Atlantidea. Atlanta souleyeti 

 Smith appears to belong to the same group. It differs from rotun- 

 data by the more prominent spire. In the figure of the ventral face 

 (fig. 15, above) the spire is concealed behind the lip.

Atlanta cordiformis Gabb. Text-fig. 14. 



Atlanta cordiformis Gabb, Trans. Amer. Philos. Soc. xv, 1873, p. 201. 



A very minute species, composed of A\ whorls, the last carinate 

 and bearing the usual peripheral lamina, which is mainly broken 

 away. The aperture is cordiform, its inner edge in contact with 

 the preceding whorl, not supported on the peripheral lamina. This 

 may be a feature of immaturity. It is a much smaller shell than 

 A. peronii having the same number of whorls. 



Diameter 1.5, greatest width of aperture 0.55 mm. 



Type and two other specimens are no. 2896 A. N S. P. 



Atlanta peronii Leseuer. 



Two small specimens, the largest 3.7 mm. in diameter. It is evi- 

 dently adult, somewhat over half a whorl being in contact with the 

 peripheral lamina only. On account of its small size, the reference 

 to A. peronii is made with some doubt, yet in other characters we 

 find no material difference. 



PROSOBRANCHIATA. 

 TEREBRIDAE. 



The larger Terebras of Santo Domingo are in some confusion, 

 owing chiefly to the absense of figures of the types of three species 

 described by Sowerby. Guppy 13 figured "T. sulcifera Sowerby, " 

 from the Heneken collection, but as he united sulcifera, inequalis 

 and bipartita of Sowerby, we do not know definitely which was fig- 

 ured, nor whether his shell was from the original or the second 

 Heneken collection. The T. bipartita of Dall 14 appears to us to be 

 a different species from that of Sowerby. 



Gabb 's identifications were apparently erroneous. His T. inae- 

 qualis is T. haitensis of Dall, 15 and his bipartita is the form we refer 

 to inaequalis Sowerby. T. robusta Hinds, of Gabb, is T . gabbiDoM,

a form which needs comparison withT 7 . sulcifera Sowb. There is a 

 considerable amount of material in the collection, but as Gabb 

 described no new species in this group, we will not enter into the 

 subject further. No revision of any value can be made until 

 Sowerby's types are figured and more fully described. 



In addition to the species named above, Terebra amitra Dall 17 has 

 been described from the Potrero, Rio Amina. 



A very large species of Terebra, distinct from all of the above, is 

 represented by one broken and much worn specimen no. 2972. It 

 has slightly over 4 whorls, with a length of 85.5, diam. 26 mm. 

 There are two raised bands around the posterior part of the whorls.

An abundant species in the Santo Domingo beds. Gabb referred 

 the specimens to T. dislocata. About half of them have spiral lines 

 upon the superior band, as in T. wolfgangi Toula, but there are more 

 spiral cords below the band than in typical wolfgangi. 



Terebra dislocata Say. 



The series referred to this recent species is highly variable, and 

 a further revision may eventually be made. 



There is also a series of small specimens possibly related specific- 

 ally to T. protexta Conr.

Turris (Surcula) rara Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc, xv, 1873, p. 207. 



This is represented by one imperfect specimen. The whorls are 

 fiat, sculptured with spiral raised lines, about fifteen between su- 

 tures on the penult whorl. There are crowded, sharp and irregular, 

 axial striae. The upper whorls have a slight median angle. The 

 slit-fasciole is not distinctly differentiated on the last two to two- 

 and-a-half whorls, but above that it is slightly prominent and weakly 

 nodose.

Surcula jacquensis (Sowerby) Plate XXII, fig. 21, 22. 



Pleurotoma jacquensis Sowerby. Q. J. Geol. Soc, vi, 1849, p. 51. 



Considered by Gabb to be a synonym of Drillia henekeni, but it is 

 a distinct species of Surcula. The last whorl has nine or ten large 

 axial ribs which are crossed on the whorls of the spire by six spiral 

 cords, the upper one sometimes accompanied by one or two threads. 

 On the last whorl these cords and threads number about twenty-five, 

 and in many specimens alternate in size, especially towards the 

 anterior end. There is a spiral raised line just below the suture, 

 and the anal fasciole has weak growth-lines or is smooth.

Surcula longicaudata (Gabb) Plate XVII, fig. 2. 



Turris {Surcula) longicaudata Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc, xv, 1873, p. 208. 



This species resembles Drillia consors somewhat in form and sculp- 

 ture, but has the generic characters of Surcula. The two apical 

 whorls are smooth, remaining whorls of the spire with large, rounded 

 slightly protractive ribs, which are crossed by six acute, spiral 

 threads, which are a little widened where they cross the ribs. Be- 

 low the suture, and extending to the angle of the anal fasciole, there 

 is a series of short, slightly retractive riblets. The last whorl is 

 evenly reticulated with axial and spiral ridges, tubercular at their 

 intersections. The interstices are minutely papillose.

to Pleurotoma servata Conr., from the Vicksburg Oligocene. The 

 chief difference is the greater sinuosity of the growth lines of the 

 body whorl, which run backward both above and below the convex 

 portion of the whorl to near the suture; also in having a more pro- 

 minent angle at the periphery. 



Length of specimen figured 20.5 mm.; a larger specimen, fig. 5, in 

 which the spire is broken, measures 24.5 mm. Another example 

 has the nodes partially obsolete on the last whorl.

Two apical whorls are smooth, the rest having large, rounded, ax- 

 ial ribs crossed by four keel-like ridges on the whorls of the spire, 

 and about twenty on the last whorl, the intervals densely striated 

 spirally. The sinus is deep and strongly contracted in front when 

 the lip is perfect.

Very similar to D. elocata, but it is more slender with a longer 

 anterior canal and a deeper posterior sinus, the anal fasciole and

 in each interval about 6 striae. There are seven broad, rounded 

 axial folds on the penult whorl and on the last, weakening on the

anal fasciole. On the face of the last whorl there are 18 narrow, 

 high spiral ridges, a smaller cord above the upper one and a strong, 

 acute cord below the suture. The outer lip is smooth within; inner 

 lip a little raised. The anal sinus is deep, rounded posteriorly, con- 

 tracted a little anteriorly. 



Length (the early whorls lost) 26.5, diam. 8.3 mm.; 6^ whorls 

 remaining.

It seems strange that in the absence of specimens of D. militaris, 

 Gabb referred D. consors to that recent species. 



A specimen of D. consors, 41.6 mm. long, 12 wide, has 23 axial ribs 

 on the last whorl, and about 18 spiral cords. A strong presutural 

 keel revolves above the anal fasciole. 



It is an abundant shell. No. 2935.

Judging by the description and figure, this is very near D. ales- 

 idota macilenta Dall, but it differs by the columellar lip, which is 

 straight to the base, and by the narrower aperture.

Closely related to D. gatunensis Toula, but it differs by having the 

 spiral grooves simple throughout, not occupied by minor spirals on 

 the base; the vertical ribs do not retract strongly above the shoulder 

 as they do in D. gatunensis, in which the growth lines are much more 

 deeply sinuated at the anal fasciole.

Pleurotoma venusta Sowerby, Q. J. Geol. Soc. vi, 1849, p. 50, pi. 10, fig. 6. 



This species has been well figured by Sowerby and is represented 

 by many examples in the Gabb collection (no. 2931). It has no 

 direct relationship with D. jamaicensis Guppy, which has been 

 united with it (Proc. U. S. N. Mus. vol. 19, 1896, p. 305). They 

 are conspicuously diverse in sculpture, form and size, in large series 

 of both we have examined. D. venusta attains a length of over 45 

 mm., while 19 mm. is about the maximum size of jamaicensis. 



Drillia jamaicensis (Guppy) 



Pleurotoma jamaicensis Guppy, Q. J. Geol. Soc. xxii, 1866, p. 290, pi. 16, fig. 6. 

 Drillia ebenina Dall, Trans. Wagn. Free Inst. Sci. iii, pt. 1, 1890, p. 33, pi. 

 2, fig. 8. 



Dr. Dall says of his D. ebenina, "Miocene of Santo Domingo 

 (Gabb) ; Pliocene of the Caloosahatchie beds. Recent on the shores 

 of the Gulf of Mexico from Florida to Vera Cruz." And after the 

 description, "This fine species was first found living in shallow water 

 on the Florida Keys by H. Hemphill. I find specimens of it to- 

 gether with several other species confused together under the name 

 of jamaicense Guppy in the Gabb collection at Philadelphia." 

 Some error is involved in these statements, as there is no such shell 

 in the Gabb collection, and Gabb makes no reference to "jamai- 

 censis" in his work. There are specimens of Pleurotoma jamaicense 

 Guppy, from Jamaica, in the collection of the Academy, obtained 

 from Mr. Vendryes and from other sources. These agree well 

 with Dr. DalPs description and figure of D. ebenina, and with speci- 

 mens from the Caloosahatchie Pliocene. 



While this species may occur in Santo Domingo, we have at 

 present no evidence that it does.

The whorls bear stout oblong, peripheral nodes, about 9 on the 

 penult, each over-ridden by an acute protractive raised line which 

 is a former free lip-edge. There is a strong varix a short distance 

 behind the lip. The whole surface has a fine sculpture of irregular, 

 interrupted, crimped spiral threads, the intervals densely and much 

 more minutely crossed by raised growth striae. The outer lip is 

 broken in all of the specimen.

The type specimen has about 13 axial ribs on the last whorl. 

 Under sufficient magnification it shows close spiral lines of granules, 

 every fourth line slightly larger. On the spire the whorls are strong- 

 ly angular in the middle, but this angle weakens a good deal on the

After \\ rounded apical whorls, there is a half whorl having num- 

 erous ribs. On subsequent whorls there are seven narrow, acute 

 axial ribs, continuous from whorl to whorl. Fine, but clearly en-

 last half-whorl, which has close, fine backwardly arched riblets. 

 Subsequent whorls have slightly protractive rounded ribs, eleven 

 on the penult whorl, rather high, and compressed below the sutures; 

 in the lower half of each whorl crossed by three spiral threads, in 

 the intervals of which there are about three very low spirals. On 

 the last whorl there are about 20 major spirals; they are closer anter- 

 iorly, where there are fewer of the low minor spirals, there being 

 four in the upper intervals, down to one in the lower. The aperture 

 is of nearly the same width throughout. Anal sinus rounded.

 they become smaller and bifurcate below the shoulder, and the 

 last whorl has numerous narrow ribs, part of them uniting by pairs 

 at the shoulder. In the series of 9 individuals, there is very great 

 variation in size and shape. It is possible that with further large 

 series, an assortment into several species would be practicable, 

 though this seems unlikely. The smallest one having a complete 

 adult aperture is 14.5 mm. long, of 9 whorls. Others measure: 



Length 32.4, diam. 13 mm.; 9| whorls (type). 



Length 31 (estimated), diam. 10 mm. 



Length 26.4, diam. 10 mm.; 10^ whorls. 



This is type of the genus Glyphostoma. It is certainly distinct 

 from the recent Clavatula dentifera Hinds, but if that species is a 

 Glyphostoma, as seems likely, the name dentiferum Gabb will have 

 to be changed. Perhaps martinicensis Cossmann will be available; 

 but the figures are imperfect and I am not sure that the forms are 

 specifically identical.

This species has a mamillar embryonic shell of If whorls, the 

 first rounded and very bulbous, though small, the last third of the 

 last embryonic whorl becoming angular in the middle. After that 

 the neanic sculpture appears abruptly, strong, protractive peripheral 

 nodes crossed by fine, sharp, spiral threads. On the last whorl the 

 spirals are hardly noticeable except near the base. The crenula- 

 tions within the Â©uter lip are short and sharp.

A Scobinella has been described from Mindi, Canal Zone, under 

 the name Euchilodon morierei Laville MS., by M. Cossmann. 18 It 

 has a shorter anterior canal than either of the Santo Domingan 

 species, and differs in some details of sculpture, but it evidently 

 stands close to-S. tristis. These species cannot belong to the genus 

 Eucheilodon, which differs conspicuously by having a numerous series 

 of ten or twelve short subequal transverse folds on the collumella, 

 somewhat as in some Columbellas. In Scobinella the structure is 

 like Mitra.

A handsome, very elaborately sculptured species. The anal 

 fasciole forms a strongly elevated band at the shoulder. This band 

 is bilirate, the two cords tuberculate, the tuberles being connected 

 across the interval. Below the shoulder there is a close sculpture 

 of larger alternating with smaller spiral cords and threads crossed 

 by close but very much interrupted axial threads, the intersections 

 graniferous. Near the anterior end the axial sculpture disappears. 

 Above the shoulder there are crowded, granose spirals. The rather 

 small anal sinus is continued inward as a furrow. Below it are 

 many sharp lirae within the lip. The columella has two strong 

 plaits, the upper one larger and flat-topped. The lower plait is 

 about midway between the ends of the inner margin. In half- 

 grown individuals there is a third distinct plait, and in one the weak

trace of a fourth may be seen. A complete shell should have about 

 9 whorls. 



The embryonic shell consists of 1| smooth convex whorls, the 

 summit a little obtuse. 



Length 24, diam. 9.1, length of aperture 13 mm. 



This species differs from Borsonia, as defined byM. Cossmann, 

 by the large upper plait high on the columella, and the sinus at the 

 shoulder, terminating an elevated anal fasciole; the sculpture other- 

 wise much as in Scobinella. We propose for it the new subgenus 

 Paraborsonia. 



Rouaultia has the sinus in the same situation, but it differs widely 

 in other characters.

There are fourteen nodes on the periphery of the last whorl, below 

 which are numerous, strongly unequal spiral cords and threads. On 

 the whorls of the spire only three spirals are visible,, the upper one 

 being peripheral. Between the concave anal fasciole and the suture 

 there is a prominent spiral ridge. The single columellar plait is 

 strong and but little oblique. 



Length 9.6, diam. 3.9 mm.; 8| whorls. 



It probably belongs to the subgenus Borsonella Dall, though the 

 sculpture is rather diverse.

This was included by Gabb in C. haytensis, but it may be distin- 

 guished by the pyriform contour, distinctly contracted near the 

 anterior end, and the usually more acute spire. Four or five of the 

 upper whorls are conspicuously nodose. The spirals of the anterior 

 half are more or less granulous. On comparing a good series of dif- 

 ferent ages with C. symmetricus we consider them quite distinct spe- 

 cies.

This species is undoubtedly close to the recent C. pyriformis Reeve 

 from the west coast of Central America, which is probably a des- 

 cendant. C. recognitus is quite readily distinguished by the small 

 nodes on the spiral whorls being obsolete, or present only on three 

 or four of the upper whorls, while in C. pyriformis they are promi- 

 nent on at least seven. It is also less pyriform.

This was originally described and figured from a very young ex- 

 ample. It attains the size and has the form of C. consobrinus, but 

 differs by lacking tubercles on the spire. The upper whorls have 

 a smooth, sharp carina projecting above the sutures, becoming 

 blunt on the last 2 or 3 whorls in adults. Above the angle there 

 are very fine spiral striae. Lower half or more of the last whorl is 

 spirally striate, some of the spirals bearing granules. Young shells 

 have more granulose spirals, as usual in this genus.

The spire is striate, as in C. haytensis but the early whorls are 

 not nodose above the suture. The granulation occupies from one- 

 third to the whole of the last whorl. Ordinarily there are several 

 nearly smooth, smaller spiral threads between the beaded spirals, 

 but in some examples these secondary threads are as large as the

primaries, and nearly all are beaded. The very large series also 

 comprises specimens transitional in sculpture. 



It is much smaller than C. hay iensis, the maximum size seen having 

 a length of 48.5, diam. 28.5 mm.

This species resembles C. haytensis somewhat in form, but differs 

 by having conspicuous, widely spaced spiral grooves on the lower 

 two-thirds of the last whorl. These grooves are very sharply cut 

 in half-grown shells ; in the largest example some of them are a little 

 less deeply cut. There are about 12 widely spaced grooves and an 

 equal number of close ones near the anterior end. The spire has 

 close and rather deep spiral striae, 4 or 5 on each whorl. The inner 

 whorls are inconspicuously tuberculate above the suture. The 

 growth-lines retract strongly at the shoulder, as in C. stenostoma. 

 which is allied.

Gabb misunderstood this species. What he called C. planiliratus 

 is an undescribed species which will be called C. perlepidus. 



C. planiliratus is an extremely variable shell in sculpture of the 

 last whorl, but the shape and the sculpture of the spire are quite 

 constant. In large specimens the spirals are weak on the upper 

 half of the last whorl (fig. 9). 



Length 42, diam. 21 mm. or smaller. 



We agree with Guppy 's determination of this species. He has 

 figured a Jamaican specimen.

The upper part of the spire is regular, but the penultimate whorl, 

 at its last third, begins to descend more rapidly, this continuing in 

 the last whorl. The earliest whorls are worn, but the intermediate 

 ones have low and obtuse but strong nodes, and no spiral striation.

The nodes become weaker on the penult whorl and almost disappear 

 on the last. The last two whorls have the periphery unusually 

 rounded for a Conus. There are about 9 coarse spiral cords near 

 the anterior end.

This cone resembles C. proteus closely in shape except that the 

 the spire is lower, with much less concave outlines, the apical angle 

 much wider. The spiral furrow below the suture is deeper. In 

 color it is a "negative" of C. proteus, the spots being white, the in- 

 tervals ferrugineous. This color affects the texture of the shell, 

 the white spots resisting erosion. In one worn specimen there are 

 spiral series of pits along the colored bands. The anterior third 

 of the last whorl has a few narrow raised spirals.

somewhat oblique, narrow; outer lip obtuse, evenly arcuate, with 

 marginal crenulations corresponding to external spirals, and a 

 much smaller number of lirae (12) extending further within. The

 epistomifera. There is a trace of the characteristic spout of the lip, 

 but much less marked than in that abundant species. The axial 

 ribs are fewer, more widely and less regularly spaced in gabbiana. 



Cancellaria (Trigone-stoma) insularis Pils. and Johns. Plate XXII, fig. 11. 



Proc. A. N. S. Phila., 1917, p. 163. 



After the If smooth embryonic whorls the sculpture begins ab- 

 ruptly; there are about 14 retractive ribs on the first neanic whorl, 

 crossed by about 7 very much finer, spiral threads. The last whorl 

 has two somewhat enlarged ribs or varices next behind the lip, and 

 one but slightly prominent on the left side of the ventral face. 

 There are no varices on the earlier whorls. The spiral sculpture 

 of the last whorl is far less coarse than in C. gurabis Maury. There 

 are no spirals in the sutural excavation. 



While evidently related to C. gurabis, this differs in so many de- 

 tails that with present materials it appears to be distinct. 



OLIVIDAE. 

 Oliva reticularis Lam. 



The specimens which we refer to typical 0. reticularis are read- 

 ily separated from 0. cylindrica, in the large series at hand.

Oliva cylindrica Sowerby. Plate XXIII, flgs. 2, 3. 



Oliva cylindrica Sowerby, Q. J. Geol. Soc. vi, 1849, p. 45. 

 Oliva giraudi Cossmann, Journ. de Conchyl., hi, 1913, p. 56, pi. 5, figs. 1, 6-8 

 (Martinique), figs. 4, 5, (Saint-Domingue.) 



This abundant Olive is distinguishable from 0. reticularis by the 

 wider, more cylindric form, the lower spire composed of flat (not 

 concave) whorls. The shape is much more like Oliva splendidula 

 Sowb., of the west coast of Central America. 



There is the usual variation in height of the spire and degree of 

 concavity of its outlines, such as occurs in most species of Oliva. 



Length 52, diam.25mm. (PI. XXIII, fig. 2). The largest specimen 

 of a very long series is 60.5 mm. long. 



M. Cossmann has figured a quite small specimen from Santo 

 Domingo, under the name Oliva giraudi, but which appears to us 

 indistinguishable from 0. cylindrica except by its smaller size. The 

 length he gives for the species, 93 mm. is probably an error for 33 

 mm. 



Oliva proavia Pils. and Johns. Plate XXIII, flg. 1. 



Proc. A. N. S. Phila., 1917, p. 164. 



This fine Olive requires comparison with 0. cristooalcoloni Maury, 

 which may prove to be an immature specimen of the same species. 

 It is relatively broader, with a differently shaped spire and more 

 fully developed plaits on the inner lip. 



Oliva brevispira Gabb. Plate XXIII, flg. 4. 



Oliva brevispira Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc. xv, 1873, p. 215. 



This species 'resembles 0. reticularis in form, but is distinguished 

 from other Tertiary and recent species of the region by its very 

 short spire. The greatest width is above the middle. About 30 

 small plaits are on the inner lip. These are somewhat unequal and 

 unevenly spaced, some being spaced by pairs. The siphonal fas- 

 ciole is strongly oblique, its upper ledge entering above the middle 

 of the inner lip. 



Length 34.5, diam. 14 mm., length of aperture, measured to the 

 suture, 30 mm. 



The type, no. 2997 A. N. S. P., is somewhat worn, and none of 

 the six examples is quite perfect. By the shape of the columella it 

 has some resemblance to 0. nebulosa Lam. 0. brevispira of Maury 

 is a different species. 



Oliva gradata Gabb. Plate XXIII, flgs. 10, 11. 



Oliva gradala Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc. xv, 1873, p. 215. 



The special character of this species is that there is a sharp though 




336 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART II 



slight off-set or ledge encircling the last whorl a short distance 

 (nearly 3 mm.) below the suture. On the whorls of the spire this 

 is concealed by a smooth callus deposit over the inter-sutural space. 

 The spire is straightly conic up to the nipple-like 2 or 3 apical whorls. 

 The inner lip has about 15 strong, evenly spaced plaits. 



Length 28.5, diam. 12 mm.; aperture, measured to suture, 20 mm. 



The type, with two slightly smaller specimens, is no. 2998 A. N.

Oliva muticoides Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc, xv, 1873, p. 215. 

 Oliva canaliculata Gabb, torn. cit. p. 215. Not of H. C. Lea. 



Gabb's two descriptions apply to the high- and low-spired ex- 

 tremes of a single species. The large series before us contains com- 

 pletely transitional examples. 



A thick labial callus extends from the basal fasciole to the suture, 

 its abrupt edge straight and parallel with the lip. 



Length 19.8, diam. 8 mm., length of aperture 13 mm. (type of 

 multicoides) . 



Length 18, diam. 8.5 mm., length of aperture 13.3 mm. (type of 

 canaliculata) . 



Of the three specimens figured, fig. 7 represents the type of muti- 

 coides fig. 6 a transitional example, and fig. 5 the type of canalic- 

 ulata. 



The type and two other specimens of 0. muticoides are no. 2805

 merous other specimens.

 cies of the same region.

Oliva mutica Say, Journ. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., ii, 1822, p. 22. 



Voluta nitidula Dillwyn, in part, and of authors; not of Deshayes, 1837. 



Several specimens agree in every way with the recent form. Vo- 

 luta nitidula Dillwyn was a composite species, including mutica 

 Say and 0. pusilla Marratt. If the name is used at all, we suggest 

 that it be taken for 0. pusilla.

HARPIDAE. 



Harpa amehcana n. sp. Plate XXIII, fig. 13. 



H. rosea Lam., Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc. xv, p. 214. 



The shell is ovate, of about 6 whorls, of which three smooth ones 

 form the nipple-shaped embryonic shell, the last whorl of which, 

 together with part of the first sculptured whorl, are very narrow. 

 The last whorl has about eleven low and narrow axial ribs which 

 rise into small spines where they pass over the angle bounding a 

 narrow flattening below the suture. The whole surface below this 

 angle is spirally striate, the striation strongest in the concavity of 

 the sides below. The aperture is narrow for this genus. A thin 

 callus spreads forward over the ventral convexity. 



Length 33.3, diam. 28.6 mm. 



This form is very similar to the recent Harpa rosea Lam. (H. 

 doris Bolt.), but specimens of that species of the same size have 

 more ribs and a wider aperture.

A markedly biconic species. The second and third columellar 

 plaits have flattened and slightly furrowed summits, the fourth 

 being flattened. 



Length 14.5, diam. 8.1, length of aperture 10.5 mm. 



A much smaller example, length 8.2 mm., with the type, shows 

 traces of coloration. There are 5 spiral zones, the upper, middle 

 and lower vertically lineolate with white, the other two having spot- 

 ted borders and uniform median bands.

Several specimens. Guppy 's figure is very poor, even for a Ja- 

 maica specimen. As a rule these are somewhat narrower than shells 

 from Santo Domingo. It seems very close to, if not identical with, 

 M. aurora Dall, from the Oligocene bed of the Chipola River; but 

 we have not been able to compare specimens of the latter. 



Marginella domingoensis Dall. 



Marginella domingoensis Dall, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. xix, 310, 1896. 



Four specimens we refer to this species. Dr. Dall writes: "This 

 species is close to M . aurora Dall, from the Chipola marl, but has 

 the tip of the spire less conspicuous and the aperture quite flexuous 

 instead of nearly straight. " Length 24 mm., greatest diam. 14 mm. 



Marginella cercadensis Maury. 



Marginella chrysomelina Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc. xv, 1873, p. 221. 



Four specimens, no. 3269. On two, traces of the spiral color lines 



may be seen. 



Marginella latissima Dall. 



Marginella latissima Dall, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. xix, 1896, p. 308, pi. 29, 

 fig. 11. 



The specimens of this species from Santo Domingo represent 

 a great range of variation, but with many before us it seems im- 

 possible to assort them except by sizes. Gabb referred these doubt- 

 fully to M. apicina on the label, but he did not mention the species 

 in his work. 



Marginella amina Dall. 



Marginella amina Dall, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. xix, 1896, p. 309, pi. 29, fig. 15.

Lyria pulchella Sby., Dall, Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus. No. 90, p. 58, pi. 10, fig. 11. 



Sowerby has given a good figure of this species. In some speci- 

 mens the axial ribs become obsolete on the last whorl. 



Lyria mississippiensis (Conr.) of the Vicksburg Oligocene is a 

 closely related form. Dr. Dall has recorded L. pulchella from the 

 silex beds at Ballast Point, Florida. 



Lyria soror (Sowerby) Plate XXIV, figs 11, 12. 



Voluta soror Sowerby, Q. J. Geol. Soc. vi, 1849, p. 46. 



The axial ribs are somewhat flexuous and much more delicate 






1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 339 



than in L. pulchella; the anterior spirals are stronger; finally the 

 apical whorls differ. In L. pulchella there are \\ smooth whorls, 

 the first one globose and bulging, the second narrower. In L. soror 

 the summit is smaller, the whorls increasing regularly, and there 

 are If smooth ones. These differences certainly indicate specific 

 divergence. 



Aurinia striata (Gabb) Plate XXIII, fig. 9. 



Scapha striata Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc, xv, 1873, p. 219. 



Scaphella (Aurinia) striata Gabb, Dall, Trans. Wagn. Inst, iii, 1890, p. 88. 



The rounded summit (f of a whorl) is worn; after that all of the 

 whorls are closely striate spirally. The first 2f whorls have a sub- 

 cylindric shape; then small nodules appear above the middle, which 

 becomes subangular. The last whorl has a prominent rounded ridge 

 at the shoulder, closely set with about 22 compressed nodes. Two 

 columellar plaits remain on the type, which is broken anteriorly. 

 In a very young one there are three. 



Length as broken 25, diam. 11.5 mm. Nearly 5 whorls. 



Gabb's type, nb. 3274 A. N. S. P., is a young shell; another 

 13 mm. long was taken. The consideration of the species by Dall 

 referred to above, should be consulted. 



MITRIDAE. 



Mitra henekeni Scwerby. 



Mitra henikeri Sowerby, Q. J. Geol. Soc, vi, p. 46, 1849, pi. 9, fig. 5. 



Adult specimens have but two columellar plaits, with sometimes 

 the very weak trace of a third; in young specimens the third plait 

 is more distinct. Sowerby 's illustration is good, though the speci- 

 men was incomplete. 



M . henekeni resembles the following species, but it is less slender, 

 the whorls are more convex, and are acutely carinate below the chan- 

 nelled suture. 



Length 58, diam. 15 mm. Broken specimens indicate that it 

 reaches a length of about 65 mm.

A very slender shell with three well-developed columellar plaits 

 and traces of two more. The acute spiral cords alternate with 

 smaller ones, the intervals having some spiral threads, more num- 

 erous near the base. The intervals are crossed by even, fine axial 

 threads.

Length 61.3, diam. 13.6 mm. The largest one is somewhat 

 broken, but evidently had a length of about 75 mm.

Mitra titan Gabb. Plate XXIV, figs 1, 2. 



Mitra titan Gabb, Trans. Amer. Phil. Soc. xv. 1873, p. 220. 

 Mitra symmetrica Gabb, I. c. 



This large species reminds one of M. millingioni Conr., from the 

 Jacksonian Eocene, but has finer revolving and more prominent 

 longitudinal lines, it is also somewhat wider in proportion to its 

 length. 



The adult stage is represented by one specimen, broken at both 

 ends (PI. XXIV, fig. 2), in its mutilated condition measuring, length 

 106.3, diam 43 mm. The spire shows fine spirals, every fourth one 

 deeper; tapering base densely striate spirally, the peripheral region 

 of the last whorl being smooth. In the young stage, represented 

 by Gabb's Mitra symmetrica (PI. XXIV, fig. 1), the whole surface is 

 closely sculptured with spiral cords, on the upper part of the last 

 whorl alternating with smaller threads ; the intervals being beauti- 

 fully sculptured with very fine axial threads as in M . longa. Length 

 of M. symmetrica 51.2, diam. 13.8 mm. The types of both M. titan 

 and M . symmetrica show four columellar plaits, the lower one small 

 and hardly visible in a front view. 



Five specimens around 50 to 80 mm. long, afford the stages con- 

 necting symmetrica and titan. 



Type of M. titan no. 3261 A. N. S. P. 5 smaller specimens are 

 contained in no. 3267.

The last whorl has about nineteen low, rounded, spiral cords, 

 five of which are visible on the whorls of the spire. These are 

 crossed and made subgranular by very irregular, subobsolete, axial 

 wrinkles or growth lines. In the adolescent shell there are raised 

 threads across the intervals, which appear pitted. Between the 

 upper spiral cord and the next, there is a wider interval. 



Length (summit broken) 31.3, diam. 13.8 mm. 



Type is no. 3262 A. N. S. P., with 5 smaller examples.

Mitra torluosa-Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc, xv, 1873, p. 220. 



There are about fifteen sharp, axial ribs on the last, eleven or 

 twelve on the penult whorl. Between them are many impressed 

 spiral lines, eleven or twelve on the penult whorl, parted by convex 

 intervals which become spiral cords towards the anterior end of the 

 shell, the axial ribs disappearing there. There are four columellar 

 plaits, and the outer lip is closely Urate within.

(Feb. 11, 1873.) 

 Plochelaea crassilabrum Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc. xv, 1873, p. 216. 



The shell is smooth, oblong, widest above the middle, solid; spire 

 straightly conic; suture scarcely impressed, ascending in front. 

 Last whorl swollen above, the anterior two-thirds slowly tapering: 

 terminating in a massive but low and rounded varix. The aperture 

 is sinuous, the upper half narrow, lower half dilated; lip thick, blunt, 

 the outer margin inflected, widest in the middle, dilated near the 

 base. Anterior canal deep. Columella crossed by an emerging 

 callus which is thickened in the lower half; bearing five low, round- 

 ed, parallel and contiguous entering plaits, the third one slightly 

 the strongest. 



Length 44.2, diam. 19.8 mm. Length of aperture measured 

 from base to the end of the suture, 35.4 mm. 



The type, represented by Gabb's figure and ours, is no. 3289 

 A. N. S. P. The eroded seat of an Hipponix scars the spire. In his 

 later specific description, Gabb confused this species with the fol- 

 lowing one; his measurement and the phrase relating to the columellar 

 plaits relating to the latter. 




342 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART II 



The spire is somewhat worn above, so that the number of whorls 

 is uncertain. 



The genus Plochelcea Gabb belongs, no doubt, to the Mitridae. 

 It stands close to, if not to be united with, the genus Mutyca H. & A. 

 Adams, 1853, type M . ancillides Swains., with which Mitroidea Pease 

 1865, (typeilf. multiplicata Pse.), and Mauritia H.Adams, 1869, type 

 M. barclayi H. Ad., are to be united as synonyms or sections. 

 Dibaphus Philippi (1847), is another allied genus. With a knowl- 

 edge of the above mentioned genera it seems strange that Gabb re- 

 ferred Plochelcea to the Olividae. 



The type of Plochelcea is P. crassilabrum Gabb.

Proc. A. N. S. Phila., 1917, p. 166. 



XANCIDAE. 



Turbinellidae of authors. 



The replacement of the name Turbinella by Xancus is one of the 

 outrages against scientific nomenclature consequent upon the 

 adoption of Bolten's Museum as a source of generic and specific 

 names. The disappearance of the name Turbinella necessitates 

 alteration of the family name. 



This family is remarkably well developed in the Santo Domingo 

 beds. 



Xancus rex Pils. and Johns. Plate XXVI, figs. 5, 8. 



Proc. A. N. S. Phila., 1917, p. 167. 



The spire is longer than usual in X. scolymus, not shorter as stated 

 in the original description. The inner lip often has the callus de- 

 tached at the edge. The size of adults varies a good deal. 



It is an abundant species, mistaken for X. validus by Gabb, 

 Maury and others. 



Xancus validus (Sowerby) Plate XXV, fig. 3. 



Turbinellus validus Sowb., Q. J. Geol. Soc. vi, 1849, p. 50. Not of Gabb or 

 Maury. 



This species has been misunderstood by Gabb and Maury, owing 

 to Sowerby 's qualified comparison with Turbinella scolymus. 

 The original description, however, is good, and the comparison not 

 strained when one remembers that in 1849 Turbinella comprised 

 also Vasum, Latirus and other genera. 



The shell is obesely fusiform, ponderous. The embryonic stage 

 is unknown, but the early and middle neanic whorls have thick, 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 343 



rounded axial folds, weak below the suture, 6 or 7 on a whorl, and 

 fine axial costulation, over which about 8 rather acute, narrow 

 spiral threads run. On the last 2 or 3 whorls the axial folds are 

 replaced by small, rounded tubercles disposed along a slight shoul- 

 der angle; the spirals become weak and sparse except towards the 

 base. The suture is rather narrowly, deeply channelled. At rest- 

 ing stages and the final lip the suture rises very little. There are 

 three strong plaits, the anterior one lowest and thickest. The largest 

 shell measures 176 mm. long, 80 wide. This species differs from 

 X. rex "in its tubercles, which are small and rounded, "and the less 

 emphatic sculpture generally. 



X. validus differs from Turbinella ovoidea Kiener by the channelled 

 suture and the more prominent axial folds of the spire. T. regina 

 Heilpr. is more elongate than X. validus at all stages of growth. 

 T. scolymoides Dall has more elaborate sculpture, the axial folds 

 persisting longer, and the columellar plaits are smaller. T. wilsoni 

 Conr. is more shouldered, with larger nodes. T. polygonata Heilpr. 

 seems to resemble T. wilsoni rather closely, but no good adult speci- 

 mens have been found. 



Fasciolaria textilis Guppy 19 is less excavated below the periphery 

 than the present species, but a form of the Bowden bed which we 

 had provisionally called Xancus textilis jamaicensis (PI XXV, figs. 5, 6) 

 is rather closely related. It has conspicuous axial wrinkles above 

 the shoulder, which is more developed and has larger nodes than 

 X. validus. The first whorl following the embryonic stage has 

 about twice as many axial folds as the succeeding whorls, and the 

 suture is not in the least channelled. 



A variety of X. validus with somewhat larger nodes at the shoul- 

 der was taken by Mr. L. B. Smith west of Azua, Haiti..

This fine shell, which Gabb collected in considerable quantity, 

 differs from the recent X. ovoideus by the strong sculpture of the 

 neanic whorls, as Miss Maury has pointed out. It reaches a length 

 of 175 to about 200 mm. The suture usually rises abruptly at rest- 

 ing stages and behind the final peristome. 



It differs from X. validus by the smoother later whorls. In a

 early sculpture; but no evidence of an actual intergradation is at 

 hand. 



Vasum dominicense Gabb Plate XXVII, figs. 4, 5. 



Yasum dominicensis Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc, xv, 1873, p. 218. 



Closely related to the recent V. capitellum (L.), but the shoulder 

 is less developed. There are eight obtuse, massive folds on the 

 last whorl, the intervals clathrate. The outer lip is rather weakly 

 Urate within and the columella has three rather small plaits.

This species is very distinct from V. haitense, and in fact from 

 all others known to us. The spire is much higher than in haitense. 

 Seven very large tubercles on the shoulder of the last whorl are bifid 

 at their summits, a swelling being superposed below the crest. The 

 inferior tubercular ridge is somewhat smaller than in haitense, and 

 there are slightly tubercular, very much smaller ridges above and

Leucozonia rhomboidea (Gabb) Plate XXVI, flg. 9. 



Lagena rhomboidea Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc. xv, 1873, p. 218. 



The first whorl is globose with a depressed tip; 1| smooth whorls 

 form the embryonic shell. The following whorl has axial folds and 

 spiral threads, the folds weakening and finally disappearing on the 

 succeeding whorls, but persisting as low, rounded peripheral nodes 

 on part of the last whorl. The narrow furrow encircling the base 

 has raised edges in the latter part. Outer lip is lirate within. 

 There are three small columellar plaits. 



Length 13.6, diam. 8 mm.; 6Â£ whorls. 



It is probably ancestral to the recent L. cingulifera.

Differs from recent L. brevicaudatus by the smaller, more nu- 

 merous primary spiral cords. On the convexity of the later whorls 

 secondary spiral threads occupy the intervals, and on the last part, 

 of the last whorl there are some threads of the third order.

The single specimen, in poor preservation, differs from L. elongatus 

 by the greater number of axial folds, 11 on the last whorl. There 

 are some very weak lirae within the outer lip, the lower ones broken 

 into granules, as in L. elongatus. We suspect that augustatus is 

 merely a young elongatus.

The last whorl has five broad, rounded axial folds, which extend 

 upon the narrow anterior part. Whorls of the spire with four spiral 

 cords, the lower partly concealed in the suture. There are four 

 acute lirae within the outer lip, and two small, subhorizontal plaits 

 on the columella. 



Length 31.4, diam. 9.3 mm. 



This is a typical species of Latirofusus Cossmann. The genus 

 is represented in the American Oligocene (Vicksburg) by L. per-

The great convexity of the whorls and the concavity below the

 like F. distans, with sculpture more like F. tulipa. Anterior canal 

 is very long and slender. The early neanic whorls have low axial 

 folds and spiral striae. Length 104 mm.

One broken specimen and two young ones with subangular whorls 



are referred to this species. Without more material we cannot say 



whether it is distinct from F. henekeni or a variety thereof.

 Fusus henekeni Guppy, Q. J. Geol Soc. xxxii, 1876, p. 524, pi. 28, fig. 6. 



The figure given by Guppy is poor; the whorls should be more 

 convex, and the spiral ridges larger and less numerous, there being 

 only six or seven visible an the whorls of the spire. Many of the 

 specimens show alternating spiral ridges on the larger whorls. 

 Sowerby does not mention this character, but as Guppy 's figure 

 shows it indistinctly, we would consider the form with alternating 

 sculpture to be typical. 



It probably represents the ancestral form of F. eucosmius Dall, 

 now living in 27-73 fathoms in the Gulf of Mexico and West Indies. 



Length of the form with subequal spirals 71, diam. 22 mm. A 

 specimen with prominent alternating spirals on the two large whorls 

 (obsolete on the next earlier) measures length 89, diam. 26 mm. 



It appears to be an abundant species.

The largest cotype (fig. 17)has lost- all of the spire, the last whorl 

 measuring, length 79, diam. 49.5 mm., aperture 63 mm. There is 

 a small ridge in the position of the inferior spine-series of the recent 

 Gulf species of Melongena. The strongly Urate interior is a prom- 

 inent feature. The smaller cotype (fig. 10) is a young shell 43.6 

 mm. long.

 larger specimen. Two cotypes, with an additional fragment, no.

Very closely related to M. melongena, but differing by having 

 strong spiral striation in the adult stage. It is also more ponderous. 

 The height of the spire varies a good deal. The variations in the 




348 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART II 



spines are the same as in M. melongena. The largest in the series is 

 about 15 cm. long. 



The early neanic stage is unarmed as in M . melongena, and some- 

 times it is Urate within the aperture. 



A single specimen with all the appearance of an adult is only 36 

 mm. long (no. 2798 A. N. S. P.). It is probably a dwarf, compar- 

 able to the well known dwarf form of M. corona, inhabiting inlets 

 probably deficient in salinity. (PI. XXXI, fig. 5)

The characters of the types of these species are the same except 

 that brevis is larger. The latter has a rather bulbous embryonic 

 shell of 1| smooth whorls. The following ^ whorl has numerous 

 narrow axial ribs, after which there are strong, evenly spaced axial 

 folds, 9 on the last whorl. These are traversed by acute spiral cords, 

 of which there are six on the penult whorl, with minor threads in 

 two or three of the intervals. The two cords above the suture are 

 small, following two at periphery larger. The mouth is strongly 

 lirate within, and the columella has four short, somewhat ascending 

 plaits. There is also an entering cord near the posterior angle of 

 the mouth. 



Length 20, diam. 13 mm.; 1\ whorls. 



The type of M . corrugata has 8 folds on the last /horl. It meas- 

 ures: length 15, diam. 9.4 mm. 6% whorls. As it has been broken 

 and repaired, and there is no question of the absolute identity with 

 N. brevis, the latter only has been figured.

 First post-nuclear whorl has 10 rounded ribs, 

 after which the ribs rapidly become more widely 

 spaced, until on the last whorl there are five, and 

 in a basal view (text fig. 16) the shell has a square 

 outline. There is no bend in the delicate growth- 

 lines to indicate a posterior sinus, though the aper- 

 Basal outline ture otherwise has a Drillia-like appearance. In 

 of A. quadrata. the concavity below the periphery there are fine 

 spiral striae. The columella is broad with rounded face.

This is an extremely variable species. In the large series before 

 us from both the West Indies and the west coast of Central Amer- 

 ica and Mexico, we can find no invariable character by which to 

 separate them aside from their geographic distribution. This 

 does not seem ground for specific distinction, for the two have ap- 

 parently existed unchanged since the Oligocene, when the Alantic 

 and the Pacific Oceans were still connected. 



Murex domingensis Sowerby. 



Murex domingensis Sowerby, Q. J. Geol. Soc, vi, 1849, p. 49, pi. 10, fig. 5. 

 This differs from M. recurvirostris in usually having a noticeably 

 higher spire, less spinose and slightly more elevated varices, with 

 usually four intervariceal folds that are more evenly nodose (not 

 tuberculate) ; the fine spiral lines alternating with the nodose spirals 

 are more prominent, and the anterior canal is apparently shorter. 



Murex yaquensis Maury. 



Murex antillarum Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc, xv, 1873, p. 202. Not of Hinds. 



While resembling somewhat the extreme form of M. domingensis, 

 this is no doubt specifically distinct. It is a more slender shell, with 

 rounded, convex whorls, narrowly horizontal below the suture, var- 

 ices smaller but more spinose; with six intervariceal costae that are 

 crossed by alternating spiral cords, the larger of which where they 

 pass over the costae form compressed nodes, about twelve to each 

 rib. The smooth embryonic shell consists of two trochoidal whorls 

 that are but slightly convex, and much less oblique than in M . dom- 

 ingensis.

 Cymia henekeni Maury, Bull Amer. Pal. v, p. 104. 



This is a variable species, as the figures given show, but careful 

 comparisons of the series of over 100 specimens with the type of 

 Cymia woodii (Gabb) , from the Shiloh Miocene, convince us that the 

 Santo Domingo species is distinct. The Miocene species has more 

 even spiral sculpture, a rounded periphery, and none of the peri- 

 pheral tubercles, which are present on some part of every specimen 

 of henekeni. 



In addition to the generic synonyms of Cymia given by Dall (Tr. 

 Wagn. Free Inst. Sci. iii, 154), we may mention Cumopsis Rovereto, 

 Atti Soc. Ligust. Sc. Nat. e Geogr., X, 1899, p. 105. C. tectum may 

 be taken as type. 



Cymia woodii is probably a derivative from C. henekeni, being the 

 last member of the genus in Atlantic waters. 



Cymia henekeni tectiformis n. subsp. Plate XXVIII, figs. 11, 12. 

 Cuma tectum Gabb, I. c. in part. 



The shell is similar to C. henekeni as far as the middle of the pen- 

 ult whorl, where larger tubercles appear at the peripheral angle. 

 On the last whorl there are about 8 such tubercles, those on the back 

 being very prominent and widely spaced. Above the periphery 

 there are many spirals, and below it the spiral striation is under-laid by 

 about six low spiral ridges. Dense growth-striae as in C. henekeni. 



Alt. 46, diam. 30 mm. Type; PI. XXVIII, figs. 11, 12, no. 2794. 



Alt. 45, diam. 32.5 mm. 



A very large specimen, length 54.4 mm., has but six large tubercles 

 on the last whorl. As the tubercles become progressively more 

 widely spaced, the addition of a half whorl to the usual size de- 

 creases the number. 



While the adult stage is conspicuously different, the half grown 

 and young specimens are not distinguishable from C. henekeni. The 

 two forms were mingled in Gabb's collection. 



This form is superficially like C. tectum; but that recent Panamic 

 species differs from all of the fossils by having comparatively few, 

 flat spirals, parted by narrow, deeply ejigraved grooves. The col- 

 umellar plait also, is heavier and more prominent.

This species approaches C. vespaceum (Lam.) in many respects, 

 but the more convex whorls, the prominent varices on the whorls of 

 the spire, where there are also more numerous vertical ribs, are 

 differential characters. Moreover, the embryonic shell is more de- 

 pressed, the post-embryonic whorls enlarge more rapidly, forming 

 a far thicker spire. The anterior canal is noticeably shorter.

Distortio simillimus Sby., Gabb, Journ. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., viii, p. 353. 



The Santo Domingan form, which was named Triton simillimus 

 by Sowerby, equals the recent D. constrictus in form and size (length 

 60 to 65 mm), but differs by having the spiral threads and striae 

 between the spiral cords more conspicuous. The length of the an- 

 terior canal varies a good deal; when short it is often more reflexed. 

 Except in the detail of sculpture mentioned, this form is identical 

 with the recent D. constrictus. 



Bowden specimens are smaller, with fewer minute spirals. The 

 form reported by Gabb from the Pliocene of Costa Rica is entirely 

 like the Santo Domingan examples. 



D. gatunensis Toula, from the Gatun formation, has fewer and 

 smaller spiral threads among the striae of the intervals, but is other- 

 wise identical with the Santo Domingo race in adult sculpture; but 

 it differs specifically by the larger embryonic shell, as stated by 

 Brown and Pilsbry 20 . 



The genus Distorsio seems to have had its inception in the early 



20 Proc A. N. S. Phila. 1911, p. 356.

Eocene of the Gulf or mid-American littoral. The D. septemden- 

 tatus of Gabb, a Lower Claibornian species of Texas, corresponds 

 perfectly with what, on theoretical grounds, the earliest form of the 

 genus should be. 



It would seem that the groups Ranularia, Lampusia, and Dis- 

 torsio, diverged about this time from a common stock. D. septem- 

 dentatum is but slightly distorted. The irregular bulging of the 

 whorls, correllated with the rise and fall of the sutures and conse- 

 quent alternate widening and contraction of the' body chamber, 

 has just begun, and is yet far less strongly developed than in any 

 later species. The spreading callus, which masks the front in re- 

 cent forms, has not appeared. The teeth are small, and the mouth 

 not contracted in a grimace. The sculptural features of Distorsio 

 are present, but the earlier whorls retain those of other small Eo- 

 cene Tritons. 



Acceleration along the lines foreshadowed in D. septemdentatus 

 rapidly ensued, typical Distorsios appearing in the Vicksburg Oli- 

 gocene. We may suppose that the group spread westward through 

 the open strait between the Americas, and the swimming Sinusigera- 

 like larvae, caught in the Equatorial current, were carried to the 

 West Indies. In southern Europe the genus appeared in the middle 

 Miocene, but whether derived from America or the eastern seas is 

 doubtful. 



Of the recent species, D. anus (L.),the type of Distorsio, has 

 strongly defined characters, everywhere recognized. The others 

 have suffered great vicissitudes in nomenclature, and in order to 

 determine the status of the Oligocene forms a revision of the specific 

 nomenclature was undertaken. The following names and probably 

 some others, have been proposed in the group:

Recent monographers have lumped all the living forms under one 

 or other of the above names, but there seem to be three or four 

 valid species among them. The principal synonomy of the recent 

 forms is given below; that of the European Miocene species has 

 been duly set forth by Bellardi. 21 



Distorsio reticulata Link. Includes acuta Perry, cancellinus 

 Lam. (?), mulus Dillw., pusilla Pse., cancellinus Reeve. 



This species is the common Indo-Pacific form. Its chief, and so 

 far as we know, invariable character is the presence of a prominent 

 and somewhat gibbous bilirate ridge or keel at the shoulder, on the back 

 of the shell. 



The strong entering fold on the upper part of the parietal wall 

 is more distant from the oblong tubercle above it than in the 

 Antillean species, and the typical form has a wider sinus on the 

 columella, and less prominent third tooth within the outer lip. 

 Reeve's figure of cancellinus (Conch. Icon. pi. 12, fig. 45) well re- 

 presents the face of the shell. 



The Murex cancellinus, attributed to Roissy by various authors, 

 was originally described by Lamarck, the account in Sonnini's 

 Buffon being merely a repetition. Lamarck described the shell as 

 a Grignon fossil, but there cannot be much doubt that it was either 

 a stray bleached example of one of the recent species or the European 

 Miocene D. tortuosum. As he refers to Martini's figures, those 

 who used the name for the recent D. reticulata are not without 

 justification; but in view of the uncertainty attending it, and its 

 later date than Link's name, it had better be placed in the syn- 

 onymy. No later author has recorded M. cancellinus, or any 

 Distorsio, from the Parisian Eocene. 



D. decipiens(Rve.) is a smaller form with reddish apertural 

 callus and a series of four short folds on the parietal wall above, in 

 place of the two large ones of typical reticulata. The third tooth 

 of the lip is prominent; the back angular as in reticulata. While it 

 may turn out to be a subspecies of D. reticulata, the differential 

 characters are constant in the small series examined.

1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 359 



Distorsio clathrata (Lamarck). This is the ordinary Antillean 

 species, and has no synonyms except the several misapplications 

 of names really pertaining to the Eastern species, unless Triton 

 ridens of Reeve belongs here, which we are unable to determine in 

 the absence of information on its sculpture. 



It differs from the Oriental species (reticulata) in the evenly 

 rounded back of the last whorl, sculptured with regularly spaced 

 spirals. It is not keeled at the shoulder and the lirae are not con- 

 tiguous there. The two folds on the parietal wall posteriorly are 

 much more nearly contiguous than in reticulata: the third tooth 

 within the outer lip is prominent, and the columellar sinus is deep 

 and narrow- Kiener's figures of a specimen from Lamarck's col- 

 lection are characteristic. (Icon. Coq. Viv., Triton, pi. 14, fig. 1.) 



So far as we know this species does not occur in the Miocene of 

 Santo Domingo; but in the doubtless somewhat later Bowden 

 Miocene a small, but otherwise practically typical race occurs, 

 which has been figured by Guppy as "Persona simillima Sowb." 

 (Quarterly Jour. Geol. Soc. XXII, 288, pi. 17, f. 13.) 



Distorsia constricta (Broderip), ( Triton constrictus Brod., P. Z. S. 

 1833, p. 5), is similar to D. reticulata in the angular back, this form 

 is more like D. clathrata in the aperture. At the peripheral angle 

 there are two contiguous spiral cords; below these are about ten spi- 

 rals, and above them only one. The intervals between spiral cords 

 have fine spiral striae. 



The third tooth of the outer lip is enlarged; the two posterior 

 folds of the parietal wall are rather near together, as in Distorsio 

 clathrata. 



The recent form belongs to the Panamic fauna. It was doubtless 

 derived from the Antillean tertiary fauna where the stock is now 

 extinct. 



The first recognized member of the series is D. crassidens Con- 

 rad, 22 of the Vicksburg Oligocene. This is small, and differs from 

 the recent forms by having many unequal spiral threads and 

 striae in the intervals between the spiral cords. Its genetic rela- 

 tion to the. later Miocene D. c. simillima and the recent D. con-

Bursa crassa proavus n. subsp. Plate XXIX, figs. 4, 5. 



Bursa crassa Desh., Gabb., Tr. Am. Philos. Soc. xv, p. 212. 



The shell differs from B. crassa (Dillw.) by the broader form and 

 more strongly developed granulation ; the anal sinus is more oblique and 

 shorter, its end is not so high as the summit of the varix behind it. 

 The smooth embryonic shell is Naticoid, while that of B. crassa has 

 a more elevated and conic spire. 



Length 25, diam. 19 mm.; 33^ embryonic and 3^ later whorls. 



Type no. 3227 A. N. S. P. 



The Bowden form of B. crassa 23 is that which approaches the 

 present form most closely, having similar coarse granulation; but 

 it differs by the more conic embryonic stage, and at all stages of 

 growth the anal canal is longer and more direct. It may be called 

 Bursa crassa bowdenensis n. subsp., PI. XXIX, fig. 8. Type no. 3747 

 A. N. S. P. 



In the recent form the granulation is perceptibly finer, or often 

 subobsolete on the last whorl, and another character has come in; 

 in the most progressive examples the peripheral tubercles disappear 

 and one or two intervariceal nodules take their place. 



CASSIDIDAE.

 view, by the predominance of a dorsal tubercle. The largest ex-

Cypraecassis testiculus Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc. xv, 1873, p. 222. 

 Three rather small specimens 33 to 35. 5 mm. long. In one the

 Cassis monilifera Guppy, Quar. Jour. Geol. Soc, xxii, 287, pi. 17, fig. 8. 



This form is almost exactly intermediate between C. inflata 

 granulosa of the Antillean fauna and C. abbreviata of the Panamic 

 region, and may well have been their common progenitor. It has 

 the somewhat coronated whorls of abbreviata, there being two 

 prominent granose spirals at the shoulder. The rest of the body- 

 whorl, in the Santo Domingo shells, is granose at the intersect- 

 ions of narrow vertical folds with the spirals, in small examples, vary- 

 ing to nearly free from longitudinal sculpture in some large ones; and 

 irregularly plicate but not granose in others. The smooth embryonic 

 shell is perhaps a little smaller and shorter than in the Pacific C. 

 abbreviata, similar to that of C. granulosa. 



Sconsia laevigata (Sowerby) 



Cassidaria laevigata Sowb., Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc, vi. 47, pi. 10, fig. 2. 1849. 

 Cassidaria laevigata Sowb., Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc, xv, 1873, p. 222. 



The Santo Domingo form is closely related to S. lintea, a local 

 lateral branch which left no descendants. It differs from S. lintea of 

 the Vicksburg beds only in being free from spiral sculpture in the 

 middle, in the absence of a coronal series of slight pointed tubercles 

 or folds, usually developed in S. lintea, and in attaining a more 

 ponderous growth. The young shells, being striate throughout, are 

 indistinguishable. The Pliocene and Recent S. striata is more coarse- 

 ly sculptured than any laevigata, and does not become so broad. 



The Jamaican S. subloevigata is intermediate between lintea and 

 striata in character, but nearer the latter, of which it may fairly be 

 reckoned a subspecies. 



The genus Sconsia Gray has an interesting history in the 

 American tertiaries, wherein both its origin and development are 

 revealed. The series begins in the Claibornian Eocene with S.

nupera (Conrad), 24 which varies so markedly toward Cassis (Pho- 

 lium) brevicostatus Conr., that it is evident the two are but slightly 

 divergent mutations of a common ancestor. In S. nupera the den- 

 ticulation of the lip and columella is but weakly developed; varices 

 are present but not strong; the columellar callus is adnate, the si- 

 phon as much recurved as in some Eocene species of Phalium, and 

 the siphonal fasciole moderately prominent. The initial whorl 

 is smaller than in later forms, but the whole embryonic shell is 

 more globose. A direct descendant of S. nupera appears to be S. 

 hodgei Conr., in the Miocene of Duplin Co., North Carolina, which 

 is modified chiefly by the loss of a convex siphonal fasciole. 



A lateral branch from S. nupera leads to S. lintea Conr., of the 

 Vicksburg Oligocene, which differs from the parent stock mainly in 

 the more slender embryonic shell. From S. lintea probably arose 

 S. laevigata Sowb.,of the Santo Domingo beds, and S. sublaevigata 

 Guppy, of the still later Bowden bed: The latter leads directly to 

 the recent Antillean 8. striata through the intermediate Pliocene 

 form of Costa Rica. 



Sconsia therefore branched from the Phalium stock of Cassididae 

 in the early Eocene, and its progress has been marked by the re- 

 duction of the columellar callus, shortening of the anterior siphon 

 and loss of a convex siphonal fasciole. It is not allied to Morio, as 

 Fischer held. 



The mutation series may be graphically represented thus :

which are not known to be represented in the Santo Domingo beds. 

 Phalium, in a slightly generalized form, was already well developed 

 at the dawn of the American marine Eocene as now known; and the 

 differentiation of the main groups of Cassididae apparently took 

 place earlier. 



Morum domingense (Sowerby) 



Oniscia domingensis Sowerby, Q. J. Geol. Soc, vi, 1849, p. 47, pi. 10, fig. 3. 

 Morum domingensis Sowb., Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc, xv, 1873, p. 223. 



This species is closely related to Morum harpula (Conr.), of the 

 Vicksburg Oligocene, but it differs by having the expanded callus 

 of the ventral side much less coarsely granulose, and only the peri- 

 pheral row of sharp tubercles appears upon the whorls of the spire. 

 In M. harpula two such rows are visible.

 Malea ringens Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc, xv, p. 223. 



This is apparently distinct specifically from M . ringens, now liv- 

 ing on the Pacific coast of Central America and Mexico; but camura 

 undoubtedly is ancestral to the living form. The difference is more 

 noticeable in the younger than in the adult individuals. In M. 

 camura the lip is less expanded and flattened, and has a uniform 

 slope toward the interior. The callous projection on the parietal 

 wall is always bilobed, not trilobed as in ringens; the columellar 

 prominence consists of a large bifurcate tooth with a smaller one 

 below it, the latter usually destinctly separated from the former. 



Guppy 's type is a young shell, but all of the Jamaica specimens 

 seem to be much smaller than the larger ones of Santo Domingo 

 and Gatun. Santo Domingo examples measure: 



Length 71, diam.' 55 mm., 4% post-embryonic whorls. 



Length 27.5, diam. 20.5 mm., 2f post-embryonic whorls. 



In specimens of all sizes, the furrows are nearly or quite as wide 

 as the spiral ridges, thus differing from the two forms following.

Although Guppy (Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc. xxxiii, 525) subsequent- 

 ly considered his species a synonym of Pyrula mississippiensis, he 

 probably did not actually compare specimens. The two species 

 agree closely in sculpture, the prominent revolving carinae being 

 slightly wider apart in P. carbasea than in P. mississippiensis. The 

 chief difference however is in the apical whorls. P. carbasea has only 

 one smooth, blunt uptilted embryonic whorl, while P. mississippien- 

 sis shows 2\ or 3 regular smooth whorls. Dr. Burnett Smith has 

 illustrated the embryonic whorls of P. mississippiensis in Proc. A.

Two specimens, which present no characters differing from the re- 

 cent shells. The larger one closely resembles a recent C. isabella 

 mexicana Stearns which we compared.

 Cypraea henikeni Sowb., var., Brown and Pilsbry, Proc. A. N. S. Phila. 1911, 

 p. 356, pi. 26, figs. 9, 10. 



This species resembles the recent C. raws, and has parallel var- 

 iations, both having smooth and bicornute or bituberculate forms. 

 In C. henekeni the tuberculate form predominates, and the tubercles 

 are larger, being thus more specialized than the modern race of the 

 same stock. It has been well figured by Sowerby. A variety occurs 

 in the Gatun bed. 



Length 38 to 66 mm. 



Cypraea spurcoides Gabb. Plate XXX, figs. 4, 5. 



Cypraea spurcoides Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc, xv, 1873, p. 235. 



Gabb has compared it with C. spurca, but of recent species it 

 seems to us closest to large examples of C. annulus in shape.

 Length 24, diam. 15.7 mm. 



Cypraea raymondrobertsi n. sp. Plate XXX, figs. 1, 2, 3. 



The shell is subovate in basal outline, solid, with the sides heavily 

 calloused, laterally angular, the callus rising high, especially on the 

 left side, and covering the spire, which is marked by a shallow irregu- 

 lar pit. Ends but little produced. The outer lip has 19 strong teeth, 

 narrower than their intervals. Inner lip with 17 teeth. The base 

 is rather strongly convex. 



Length 27, lateral diam 19.2, dorso-ventral diam. 14.9 mm. 



Somewhat like C. arabicula Lam. by its angular sides, the aper- 

 ture as in C. albuginosa Mawe. 



Type no. 3995 A. N. S. P. 



In the Bowden bed there is a form similar in having angular lat- 

 eral calluses, but differing by having fewer teeth, 16 and 13 on the 

 outer and inner lips respectively. They extend further upon the 

 base, which is less convex. Length 25.5, width 17.3 mm. This form 

 may be called Cypraea raymondrobertsi bowdenensis (PI. XXX, fig. 6).

A series of six. We find no character to differentiate them from 

 recent shells.

The shell is oblong-oval, but slightly produced at the ends, mod-

erately calloused laterally, the callouses dappled with rather small 

 dark spots; dorsal outline evenly arched, spire concealed. Outer 

 lip having 24 teeth. Inner lip with 20 short teeth, not running in- 

 ward as in C. cinerea. In the lower part of the columella an inner 

 series of 5 short teeth ma3 r be seen. 



Length 30.3, lateral diameter 18.7, dorso-ventral diam. 15 mm. 



It is less convex than C. cinerea, the posterior slope of the dorsal 

 outline less abrupt. Moreover, the markings of the lateral cal- 

 louses seem to be of a different character. The teeth are far less 

 numerous than in C. dominicensis. Named for Mr. John Campbell, 

 an enthusiastic student of the Cypraeidae. 



The type and three other specimens are no. 3000 A. N. S. P. 



Pustularia gabbiana (Guppy)

Cypraea nucleus L. 

 Cypraea gabbiana Guppy, Q. J. Geol. Soc, xxxii, 1876, p. 528, pi. 29, fig. 10. 



While this species has a general resemblance to P. nucleus L., it 

 differs by the following characters: the raised transverse lines 

 which net the tubercles together are more numerous and conspic- 

 uous; the tubercles along the lateral margins are larger; the trans- 

 verse ridges of the base alternate in size, but the smaller ones ter- 

 minate at the margin of the aperture in teeth equal to those ter- 

 minating the larger ridges; the teeth of the columellar side do not 

 extend entirely within the aperture, but end on a sort of projecting 

 ledge, inward from which a latticed-granulose sculpture is seen. 

 Finally, the aperture curves more to the left at the upper end. 



Length 15.4 to 20.2 mm.

While this may be an ancestor of S. bituberculatus, there are con- 

 siderable differences. The spire is much higher, and the spiral 

 striation differs. '

A very large Stromb, approaching S. gigas in size. 



Strombus ambiguus Sowerby, 



Strombus ambiguus Sowerby, Q. J. Geol. Soc. vi, 1849, p. 48. 



Strongly sculptured spirally, narrower than proximus with less 

 developed spines. There are several strong wrinkles on the col- 

 umellar lip posteriorly. 



Strombus ambiguus form bifrons Sowerby 



Strombus bifrons Sowb., Q. J. Geol. Soc, vi, 1849, p. 48, pi. 9, fig. 9. 



This form or incipient race, becomes somewhat larger than typ- 

 ical ambiguus; the tubercles of the penult whorl are larger and 

 less numerous. It is therefore a more advanced form, in the accele- 

 ration of this sculptural feature forming a transition to S proximus. 

 It has not the posterior wrinkles of the columellar lip of typical S. 

 ambiguus, and the outer lip is smooth or nearly so within. The 

 external spiral sculpture is strongly developed. 



Length 66, diam. 42. mm. 



Strombus proximus Sowerby.

 Strombus pugilis L., Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc, xv, 1873, p. 233. 



In this extremely abundant form, the penult whorl bears fewer 

 and larger tubercles or spines than in S. a. bifrons. In the prevalent 

 form of the race they are larger than on the last whorl. There is 

 almost invariably an inferior series of tubercles on the left side or 

 very rarely continuing to the lip. Typically the surface is spirally 

 striate; but there are transitions to the form having spirals at the 

 base only. The lip is either rugose or almost plain within. The 

 presence of wide, rounded variceal swellings on the antepenult whorl 

 appears to be variable. The maximum length is about 75 mm., but 

 55 to 60 mm. is more usual. 



Strombus proximus pugiloides Guppy. 



Strombus fragilis Moore, Q. J. Geol. Soc, xix, p. 511. 

 Strombus pugiloides Guppy, Geol. Mag. 1874, p. 433. 



The earliest form of this race appeared in the Santo Domingan for- 

 mation in a form smaller than most proximus. The spines have 

 disappeared from the last whorl or half-whorl, and spiral striae are 

 only at the base. The interior of the lip is either smooth or rugose. 

 There are sometimes traces of tubercles of an inferior series. These 

 specimens are transitional between proximus and pugiloides. 



The typical form of pugiloides is that of Bowden. It often shows 

 rufous chevrons on the back, and has invariably a smooth lip. An 




368 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART II 



inferior series of tubercles is never developed. It is also somewhat 

 larger than most Santo Domingan examples. 



S. p. pugiloides may be the ancestor of S. pugilis, or perhaps it is 

 not in the direct line. S. pugilis appears in its typical form in the 

 Pliocene of Florida and Costa Rica 



Strombi of the proximus-group are abundant shells in the Santo 

 Domingan beds. There are about 150 specimens in the Gabb col- 

 lection. 



As a whole, the series differs from S. pugilis and its varieties by 

 having the peripheral series of spines (or when spines are wanting, 

 the rounded shoulder) situated lower on the back of the last whorl, 

 the slope above it longer relative to that below it. This differen- 

 tial character is invariable. Also by the tendency to have an in- 

 ferior series of tubercles. These may be much reduced, or, in some 

 individuals wanting, yet there is never any trace of them in S. pugi- 

 lis. It appears to us that the evolutionary changes of the stock are 

 lost sight of if the forms ambiguus, bifrons, proximus and pugiloides 

 are submerged as synonyms of S. pugilis. Nothing with the char- 

 acters of the recent S. pugilis has been found in the Santo Domingan 

 or Bowden beds. 



Orthaulax inornatus Gabb. Plate XXX, figs. 13, 14. 15. 



Orthaulax inornatus Gabb, Proc. A. N. S. Phila. 1872, p. 273, pi. 9, fig. 3, 4, 

 (Feb. 11, 1873). Tr. Am. Philos. Soc, xv, p. 234. Guppy, Q. J. Geol.

 pi. 11, fig. 4. Proc. U. S. N. Mus. LI, 1916, p. 509, pi. 88, fig. 9. 



Gabb selected a specimen of medium size for type (his fig. 3, 

 our PI. XXX, fig. 15). The callus envelopes the spire but does not 

 cover the apex. There is a low longitudinal callous swelling in 

 front of the posterior end of aperture and extending up the spire, 

 and a somewhat more distinct one opposite this on the left side, 

 becoming dorsal on the spire. The shell is thus somewhat com- 

 pressed dorso-ventrally. Anteriorly there are rather weak spirals. 



Length 55, diam. 27, dorso-ventral diam. 21.7 mm. 



The largest specimen (PI. XXX, fig. 14) is injured at the apex and 

 shows no calluses, the outline seen from above being regular, not it 

 flattened dorso-ventrally. 



Length 91.3, diam. 41.7 mm. 



In a young example (Gabb 's fig. 4, our PI. XXX, fig. 13) the su- 

 ture has begun to rise at the beginning of the tenth whorl. The 

 ninth has callous swellings on each side, and is therefore a little flat- 

 tened between face and back. The cavity is also somewhat narrow- 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 369 



ed within the last swelling. The whorls of the spire show low, round- 

 ed varices, two or three on each after the first three or four, This 

 specimen is 30.2 mm. long with 9 whorls and a small part of the 

 tenth above. 



Dall 's figure of a fragment of the spire shows a somewhat greater 

 apical angle than either of Gabb's specimens. 



Orthaulax inornatus altilis n. subsp. PI. XXX, figs. 16, 17, 18. 



Four of Gabb's specimens differ from the above by the shorter 

 spire. Possibly they intergrade with the typical form, as this is 

 not a character of much constancy in Strombidae; but in the ab- 

 sence of evidence on this point it may be well to notice this form. 

 PI. XXX, figs. 17,18 represent the largest example. The apex is 

 wholly covered. There is a longitudinal callous hump on the left 

 side opposite the aperture; but as the lip is broken back the hump 

 appears to be dorsal. There are faint traces of a few spirals towards 

 the base. 



Length 52, diam., 28 mm., antero-posterior diam. 29.5 mm. 



A young example of 9 whorls, 27.5 mm. long. (Plate XXX, fig. 

 16), is similar to the young shell described under 0. inornatus ex- 

 cept that the spire is shorter, with fewer varices on the whorls. The 

 last whorl is wider and has not begun to ascend, The lower half 

 of the last whorl has numerous (about 17) spiral grooves defining 

 rather flattened cords.

Triphoris nigrocinctus? Adams, Gabb, Trans. Amer. Philos. Soc, xv, p. 239. 



We can add nothing to Gabb 's note on the single young specimen 

 of this form. It at least indicates a species of the perversa group and 

 is probably identical with Triforis calypsonis Maury. 



CERITHIIDAE. 



Cerithium microlineatum Gabb. Plate XXXII, figs. 2, 3. 



C. microlineatum Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc, xv, 1873, p. 236. 



The upper whorls show small irregular axial folds. The later ones 

 have a series of low nodes below the suture and fine unequal spirals, 

 part thread-like, part wider, the principal ones granulose. The 

 last whorl has one low, broad varix, the earlier ones rather numerous 

 varices at irregular intervals.

Sculpture of strong axial folds, angular at the shoulder, on the 

 median whorls; earlier whorls have lower folds, not angular, and 

 the last whorl has very short folds next the suture. Spiral striation 

 of unequal threads. The broken type specimen figured is 24 mm. 

 long, and has twelve folds on the last whorl. 



The sculpture varies a good deal among the 23 examples. 



This is probably an ancestral form of the more robust C. moenensis

The last 2| whorls have prominent rounded tubercles below the 

 suture, about 9 on a whorl. Below these there are about 6 tuber- 

 culiferous cords on the last whorl, with finer, unequal threads in 

 their intervals. The earlier whorls have axial folds crossed by 4 or 

 5 principal spiral cords; at first every third fold is somewhat larger, 

 then every fourth ; but on the last three whorls such variceal folds 

 do not appear. None of the specimens has a perfect aperture.

Cerithium uniseriale Sowerby. Plate XXXIII, figs. 16, 20. 



Cerithium uniseriale Sowerby, Q. J. Geol. Soc, vi, 1849, p. 51. Not of Guppy. 



One specimen, broken at the aperture, has the characters called 

 for by Sowerby 's diagnosis. It is related to C. obesum Gabb, but 

 there is a band of low tubercles below the suture, separated from the 

 principal series by a depression, and the spiral striation is coarser, 

 uneven, with some weakly granose spirals. 



We believe that Gabb's identification of this species is correct. 

 Guppy 's interpretation (Q. J. Geol. Soc, xxxn, pi. 29, fig.4) is 

 not in accord with Sowerby 's diagnosis. It is C. obesum ventricos- 

 ior. C. obesum of Guppy, tab. cit. f. 9, may be a young C. simplex 

 Gabb, though this is not certain. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 371 



C. uniseriale is an obesely conic shell. There is an infra-sutural 

 series of rather short axial folds, interrupted by a spiral depression 

 or concavity, the folds stronger below it. On the last whorl the 

 folds are smaller than on the penult. About every fourth or fifth 

 fold is stronger on the penult whorl. The surface is rather finely 

 striate spirally, and on the last whorl there are several low cords 

 which are weakly tuberculate, and there is a variceal swelling op- 

 posite the aperture. The last half whorl is broken away. There is 

 a strong callous ridge at the posterior part of the inner lip, as in C. 

 obesum. As broken the single specimen (no. 2595) measures, length 

 23, diam. 11 mm. 



This form stands near C. obesum, but differs by the impression 

 below the suture and the coarser spirals of the last whorl. 



Cerithium obesum Gabb. Plate XXXIII. figs. 5, 6. 



Cerithium obesum Gabb, Trans. Amer. Philos. Soc, xv, 1873, p. 237. 



Gabb's description is somewhat elastic, drawn to cover several 

 forms which he included under obesum, but several phrases apply 

 to only one specimen of the type lot: " Outer lip effuse, internally 

 thickened. Length 1 inch, diameter .5 inch" "expanded lip". 

 These phrases must have had in view the specimen shown in our 

 plate XXXIII, figs. 5, 6, since this is the only one in the lot which 

 retains any part of the outer lip, and agrees in size. It measures 

 24 mm. long, 12.5 wide, aperture 11.8 mm. long. The last whorl 

 rises conspicuously in its last third. The last three whorls have 

 rounded tubercles below the suture, very small and weak on the 

 antepenult. The whole surface is covered with a fine, nearly even 

 spiral striation. Eight whorls are present, the apex being slightly 

 worn. The basal part of the lip is broken. 



Type no. 2596 A. N. S. P.; some 13 immature or broken examples- 

 varying in tuberculation, are no. 2596 a. 



Cerithium obesum ventricosior n. var. Plate XXXIII, figs. 9, 10, 11, 12, 

 Cerithium uniseriale Guppy, not Sowerby. 

 The shell differs from C. obesum by the wider angle of the spire 

 and relatively large last whorl. This obese form is represented by 

 numerous examples, all having the last third or half of the last whorl 

 broken away. It seems to be what Guppy has figured as C. uniser- 

 iale Sowb. 2 '

The infrasutural tubercles are seen on two to four whorls, but 

 they are very weak except in the last whorl, or sometimes the last 

 two. They may disappear for a half whorl, to reappear later. In 

 some examples there are only weak traces of tubercles, and these 

 appear to form a transition to C. gurabense Maury. In all there is a 

 minute but distinct spiral striation, either nearly even, or sometimes 

 about every eighth thread is slightly larger.

Length as broken 26, diam. 11.5 mm. Fig. 9. 



The loss of the last half whorl makes the diameter much less 

 than in a perfect shell. 



A peculiar specimen, no. 4075, in which the last whorl is rather 

 short and rounded, and the subsutural tubercles very small, is photo- 

 graphed in Plate XXXIII, figs. 18, 19. It is a young shell, perhaps 

 referable to C. o. ventricosior .

Cerithium obesum harrisi n. var. Plate xxxm, figs. 14, 15. 



A variety which may be called harrisi, was found among unas- 

 sorted shells. It seems to be a degenerate form, perhaps from an 

 unfavorable station. It is smaller, narrower, covered with slightly 

 unequal spiral striae; there are about 6 tubercles on the back of the 

 last whorl. The suture rises steeply towards the aperture.

 tubercles, on those preceding, two series of enlarged granules. This

This shell resembles the East Indian P. palustris (L.). There are 

 four spiral cords about equal to their intervals running over small 

 axial folds and an occasional rounded varix about double the size 

 of the folds. Coincident with the varices, two lip-teeth are formed 

 internally, and there is also a callous fold on the parietal wall. Col- 

 umella has a strong oblique plait. Probably none of this armature 

 would be visible in an entire adult shell, but it is exposed in the 

 fossils, most of which are broken back to the last varix. All have 

 been rolled, and probably were washed out of a lagoon or estuary.

 in details of sculpture, having three instead of four main spirals on 

 each whorl, nodules at the intersections of the axial riblets, and a 

 very prominent varix on the left of the last whorl. The type has 

 a weak thread dividing the spiral interstices on the last whorl. In

Bittium yaquense (Gabb) Plate XXXV, fig. 12. 



Cerithium yaquensis Gabb, Trans Amer. Philos. Soc, xv, 1873, p. 238. 



There are about two varices on a whorl. On the spire there are 

 vertical rounded ribs between the varices, but these disappear on 

 the last one or two whorls. The whole shell is spirally striate. In- 

 side there are short spiral lirae within the varices. 



Length 10, diam. 3.8 mm.; 9 whorls remaining. 



Length 9, diam. 3.1 mm.; 11 whorls. 



Type no. 2619 A. N. S. P. 



The type figure is from a shell not quite mature. Most of the 

 specimens are either immature or somewhat broken. 



Bittium asperoides Gabb. Plate XXXV, fig. 4, 



Bittium asperoides Gabb, Trans. Amer. Philos. Soc, xv. 1873, p. 239. 



There are four spiral threads on each whorl, with another visible 

 in the suture, and on the last two whorls traces of one or two faint 

 ones between the major threads. Base with six equal spiral threads. 

 On the penult whorl there are 15 axial ribs, counting the two varices. 



Length 4.1, di?m. 1.4 mm.; aperture 0.85 mm.; 11 whorls. 



Type no. 2616 A. N. S. P. It is an abundant species. 



In a form which we take to be a variety (var. asperandum) there 

 are more spiral threads, 8 between sutures, and slenderer, more num- 

 erous and more arcuate ribs, about 19 on the penult whorl. Length 

 2.8, diam. 0.95, aperture 7 mm.; 11 whorls.

Alabina canaliculata (Gabb) Plale XXXV, fig. 2. 



Bittium canaliculatum Gabb, Trans. Amer. Philos. Soc, xv, 1873, p. 239. 



Shell imperforate, rather thin, turrited. The sculpture consists 

 of even, rounded, backwardly arched ribs which scarcely pass over 

 the periphery of the last whorl, the base being sculptured with about 

 seven spiral cords, the lower ones very weak. The suture is very 

 deeply impressed, the channel mentioned by Gabb being extremely 

 narrow. In the type specimen there is a low varix at the beginning 

 of the last whorl. Columellar margin reflected above. 



Length 3.3, diam. 1.25 mm.; aperture 0.85 mm.; 10 whorls. 



Length 4.6, diam. 1.6 mm.; 10^ whorls. (Type). 



Type no. 2618 A. N. S. P. 



Bittium (Styliferina) cerithidoides Dall, differs from this species 

 by its carinate upper whorls. 



In some of the specimens one or two weak spiral cords may be

seen below the suture, or even very faintly in the intercostal spaces 

 over the whole last whorl, about 6 above the periphery. In the 

 type and most others the ribbed portion shows no spirals. 



Alabina angustior n. sp. Plate XXXV, flg. 3. 



The shell is decidedly narrower, with fewer axial ribs, about 14 on 

 the last whorl. Base with about 6 spiral cords, the lower ones very 

 weak. Otherwise like A. canaliculata.

Alaba maoensis (Gabb) Plate XXXV, flg. 11. 



Cerithium maoensis Gabb, Trans. Amer. Philos. Soc, xv, 1873, p. 239. 



The type has lost the tip of the spire, and the last whorl is broken. 

 The whorls are strongly convex, with sculpture of grooves separating 

 low, convex spirals, about 13 grooves on the penult whorl. There 

 is a broad rounded varix on each whorl. 



Length 10, diam. 4.7 mm.; nearly 9 whorls remaining. 



Type no. 2617 A. N. S. P. 



MODULIDAE. 

 Modulus sp. undet. 



This genus is represented by a young shell 6 mm. in diameter, 

 and a fragment of the spire of another. They differ from M. catenu- 

 latus by wanting the low radial plications of that species. It is 

 evidently close to M. wilcoxi Dall, of the Chipola beds, but there 

 are some differences, and without adult shells a positive identifica- 

 tion cannot well be made.

Thought by Gabb to be the straight portion of Petaloconchus 

 domingensis; but some of the specimens show that the early whorls 

 are very irregularly contorted. The straightened part has three 

 striae between the rows of pustules, the central one larger. The 

 largest tube has a diameter of 10.5 mm. 



Vermetus (Petaloconchus) laddfranklinae (Maury) 



The lower whorls are very irregularly coiled, circular in section. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 377 



No internal septa were seen in these specimens. The erect, nearly 

 straight portion is cylindric, and has about 12 spiral ridges, and 

 close, fine circular striae. Diameter 4.5 mm. A larger specimen 

 with more slowly revolving spirals has a diameter of 5.2 mm. No.

Specimens in good condition show more or less minute, weak 

 spiral striation, such as may be traced in the smoother recent species. 

 Traces of color bands, somewhat wider than in the recent Cuban 

 H. ornatus, can be made out on some examples. As in many of the 

 melanians, the spire is extensively truncated, often leaving little 

 more than the last whorl. The shell is larger than any recent An- 

 tillean Hemisinus, and further differs by the shorter spire and long 

 last whorl, characters which may possibly give Ectracheliza stand- 

 ing as a "section" of Hemisinus; yet it belongs unquestionably 

 to that genus. The largest example measures, length 36.4, diam. 

 24 mm. The author has elsewhere alluded to the evidence for Ant-

There are two spiral cinguli at the periphery, with an intermedi- 

 ate thread, the upper cingulus somewhat wider and prominent. 

 Above it there are four flat cinguli, the upper one narrowest, with 

 fewer granules. Several preceding whorls show five spirals. Un- 

 der the lens delicate spiral striae are seen upon them. On the base 

 there are five cinguli, the outer one narrowest, with a thread in the 

 grooves on each side of it. The inner cingulus is toothed around the 

 umbilicus, within which two cords and one or two threads run on the 

 last whorl. The whole surface is closely ribbed radially, the riblets 

 more prominent on the cinguli than in their intervals.

RISSOIDAE. 



Not many members of this family are in the collection. Gabb 

 had no luck with his classification of the few obtained, the species 

 of Rissoina being referred to four genera. The new genus Iopsis 

 was based upon the young stage of a Rissoina. 



The Rissoinas of the Santo Domingan Miocene seem to have 

 changed very little since that time, all of those known being iden- 

 tical with, or very closely related to, modern species of the same region. 



The genus Crepitacella Guppy, 1867 (-{-Dolophanes Gabb, 1873) 

 is closely related to Rissoina, but may be held distinct by the simple 

 lip, which is sharp, without any trace of the external varix which 

 strengthens the lip of Rissoina. Otherwise it has essentially the 

 structure of Rissoina.

1889, p. 270, pi. 29, fig. 7. 



As the affinities of this snail have been variously estimated by 

 the conchologists who have considered it, some statement of the 

 changes of opinion may not be out of place. Melanopsis capula 

 (cepula) was described from a formation thought to be Upper Mio- 

 cene, at Cumana, Venezuela. Mr Guppy says: 



"I do not know of any form resembling this species, which was 

 probably not a freshwater shell. It may possibly have been an estu- 

 arine form. It reminds one of a shortened and widened Eulima, or 

 even a Slylifer." 



In forming the new genus Crepitacella for the species, in 1&67, 



Mr. Guppy notes: 



"The true position of this shell is probably in the neighborhood 

 of the family Buccinidae, in which I have provisionally placed it. Its 

 nearest relation known to me is Cyllene pulchella Adams." 



In 1876, Guppy again referred to Crepitacella cepula, placing Dolo- 

 phanes melanoides Gabb in the synonymy. 



26 The name capula was no doubt a typographical error, as in all subsequent 

 references Mr. Guppy called the species cepula (a diminutive of cepa). The syn- 

 onymy was worked out by Mr. C. W. Johnson. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 381 



In 1873, Gabb described Dolophanes melanoides as a new genus 

 and species, with the following note on its systematic position: 



"The first impression produced on looking at this little shell is 

 that it is probably a Melania; but apart from all of its three hundred 

 associates being marine, which would render such a reference im- 

 probable, it has a grouping of characters which ally it so closely to 

 Struthiolaria, that I am convinced that it is most probably a near 

 related genus. Its spire is very like that of many species of Strombidae, 

 and in the details of its mouth it differs from Struthiolaria in having 

 a thinly encrusted inner lip, an acute outer lip and an obsolete um- 

 bicilus, instead of the thickened margins and no umbilicus of that 

 genus. I have tried to identify this species with the shell de- 

 scribed by Guppy as Melanopsis capula which it seems to resemble 

 somewhat in form and size. But that author gives his shell but 

 seven whorls, and does not describe or figure the flattened tops of 

 the volutions, which are a marked character of the present species. 

 There are also other differences which, however, might be explained 

 by want of care in the artist, but which nevertheless, lead me to 

 believe that, while there may be a generic relation between the two 

 shells, they are most probably different species." 



In 1881 Dr. W. H. Dall followed the description of Pleurotoma 

 (Mangilia) columbella with the following remarks: 



"This is a species, which in the absence of the soft parts, is dif- 

 ficult to locate. It is possible it should be referred to Beta. It is 

 not unlike one or two Arctic species." 



In the "Blake" Report, 1889, Dr. Dall refers P. columbella, with 

 doubt, to Dolophanes melanoides as a variety; also placing Melanop- 

 sis capula in the synonymy, with a query. He further notes : 



"Two specimens of this form are in the collection. Guppy 's 

 specimen, from the figure, was evidently deformed. These differ 

 from it, due allowances being made for deformity, in being narrower 

 and in the narrow shoulder in front of the suture. 



"The specimen originally serving as type of M. columbella is the 

 roundest and the groove behind thesiphonal fasciole is reduced to a 

 mere chink. In the Havana specimen the chink is considerably 

 larger and the shoulder more prominent. It seems to stand about 

 one-third of the way from D. columbella to D. gabbi. I cannot be 

 sure, with so little material, but I suspect this gap might be filled 

 up by a graduated series of specimens if we had material enough. 

 Still, as the forms are not yet connected, and have already been 

 named, it seems best to leave them separate for the present. " 



Dr. Dall further writes, under the description of Dolophanes 

 (melanoides var.?) gabbi, ("Blake" Report, p. 270): 



"This genus was referred to the Struthiolariidae by its author, a 

 reference which has been questioned by all those who have had 




382 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART II 



occasion to refer to it since. The occurrence of a specimen in the 

 "Blake"dredgings, which, if not identical with Gabb's type is evi- 

 dently closely related to it, enables me to state that its proper position 

 is probably in this family [Trichotropidae] Unhappily, the operculum 

 and soft parts are wanting so that I cannot confirm my opinion by 

 reference to the details of its organization. I am inclined to be- 

 lieve that another form, also represented in the "Blake" dredgings, is a 

 representative of a shell described as a Melanopsis by Guppy, which 

 Gabb himself suspects to be closely related to his Dolophanes 

 melanioides. All these specimens are fresh, but the slight traces of 

 epidermis, which they retain, are not of the character of the northern 

 species of Trichotropis. Their variations are such that I am led to 

 believe all three may be merely mutations of one specific form. If 

 this be confirmed, the specific name of capula, given by Guppy, is 

 the oldest. Whether the differences are sufficient to constitute for 

 Dolophanes a rank higher than that of a mere section of the genus 

 Trichotropis, a more thorough knowledge of its characters is needed 

 to determine. This pretty and peculiar form is named in honor of 

 the late Wm. Gabb, to whom the generic name is due. I cannot be 

 certain without a comparison of specimens whether the present 

 shell is the same as that described by Prof. Gabb, or not. But the 

 figure is so much like our shell that I can hardly doubt they are very 

 closely related if not the same." 



After a careful comparison with the groups mentioned above and 

 others, we are convinced that Crepitacella belongs to the Rissoidae. 

 According to the principles of the arrangement in Tryon 's Manual 

 of Conchology, Vol. IX, it would be a subgenus of the genus Ris- 

 soina, close to the Section Morchiella Nevill; but the absence of a 

 labral varix may make it expedient to treat the group as generic, 

 though close to Rissoina. 



As to the specific synonymy, we are satisfied that the form of the 

 Bowden bed, Jamaica, and that of Santo Domingo named D. melan- 

 ioides by Gabb, are specifically identical, though there are some 

 differences, the Jamaican form being of a somewhat stouter, more 

 robust shape. The type of D. melanoides measures, alt. 13.7, diam. 

 7 mm., length of aperture 6.8 mm. (Plate XXXIV, fig. 12). From 

 the descriptions and figures it does not appear likely that any of 

 the other forms included in the list given above is specifically dis- 

 tinct.

Iopsis fusiformis Gabb (Text-fig. 19) is the neanic stage 

 of this species. There are two specimens in the type lot. 

 The larger one, text fig. 19, measures 2.2 mm. long, 1.2 

 diam., having 7 whorls. The outer and basal lip is some- 

 what broken. The other specimen measures 1.65 by 0.85 

 mm., with 6 whorls. The outer lip is protractive, thin, ^-.19- . 

 and the base has a distinct if short and shallow spout, formis.

The sculpture consists of many slightly protractive and weakly 

 sinuous axial riblets, which became very weak at and below the peri- 

 phery. There are very feeble and fine spiral striae above, becoming 

 much stronger at the periphery and below it, where they are blunt, 

 cord-like, and run over the less prominent ribs. Two of the spiral 

 cords are visible on the penult whorl. There is a strong varix out- 

 side the sinuous lip. The aperture has a narrow channel above, 

 and a broad, shallow sinus below. The columellar margin is worn 

 away in the middle, as though by a hermit crab. Apical whorls 

 wanting. 



Length 4.7, diam. 2.3 mm. 



Type is no. 2818 A. N. S. P. 



This species is a little stouter than recent specimens labelled R. 

 multicostata (C. B. Ad.). Except for the difference in the spiral 

 sculpture, it agrees rather well with Schwartz von Mohrenstern 's 

 figure of R. multicostata (which represents R. krebsi Morch, accord-

ing to Tryon). As the exact identity of Adams's species appears 

 to be in doubt, and the correspondence with Gabb 's shell is not ab- 

 solutely exact, we leave open the question of possible identity with 

 a recent species.

The type of B. costatum is an immature shell, lacking a half whorl 

 perhaps, 3.65 mm. long. It agrees with R. bryerea (Mont.) except 

 that there are more ribs, which are therefore somewhat smaller, 

 but not so small as in R. minuta (Gabb), or R. multicostata (C. B. 

 Ad.) The name used, by Gabb had already been given to anoth-

 Phorus dilectus Guppy, Q. J. Geol. Soc, xxxii, 1876, p. 529, pi. 28, fig. 10. 



This form was described and figured by Mr. Guppy from a young 

 specimen. The shell is far less profusely loaded with shells and 

 other objects than the recent X. conchy liophor a, and shows a much 

 greater part of the proper surface, which is copiously sculptured 

 with fine protractive wrinkles. Base as in X. conchyliophora ex- 

 cept that the umbilical chink is larger. The parietal wall is honey 

 yellow. Largest example has a diameter of 68 mm. 



This Xenophora may perhaps be a local race of X. conchyliophora, 

 but its characters indicate at least subspecific distinction.

Onuslus imperforatus Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc, xv, 1873, p. 241. 



The upper surface has the usual sculpture of fine, crowded, pro- 

 tractive wrinkles, which are not granulous. The last 3Â£ whorls

show no trace of attached objects, but several preceding whorls have 

 little pits or facets where bits of shell or pebbles were no doubt at- 

 tached, as in the recent X. indica (Gm.), though the agglutinating 

 stage was shorter, not lasting beyond the size of about 8 mm. diam- 

 eter. The base is nearly smooth, having growth-lines only. The 

 narrow umbilicus is more than half covered by the dilated colu- 

 mellar lip. There is no spiral welt near the periphery, as in the recent 

 X. caribaea (Petit), which also has a wider umbilicus and carries 

 more load.

This graceful shell varies in length of the spire, as the figures show. 

 The type measures, length 32.3, diam. 21.5 mm., and has 8 whorls, 

 the apex not quite perfect, having lost one whorl perhaps. Others 

 are larger, 37.4 mm. long, with h\ whorls remaining.

Santo Domingo. 28 It resembles P. guppyi, and the Santo Domingan 

 specimens should be compared with that species. The specimens 

 reported from the Canal Zone as Lupia perovata Conr. also need 

 comparison with A. guppyi. Mr. Guppy appears to have identified 

 this species with Natica phasianelloides Orb., 29 but that is a very 

 large species, 70 mm. long, and otherwise different in shape. 



This species and the next have not the channelled suture of A maur- 

 opsis, and perhaps belong to Ampullina or Lupia. 



Amauropsis altispira (Gabb) Text-flg. 20. 



Eutropia allispira Gabb, Tr. Am. Philos. Soc, xv, 1873, p. 242. 



The shell is imperforate, polished, composed of 5| 

 rounded whorls, which slope below the suture. The 

 columella is slightly thickened, and is dilated slight- 

 ly above the axial region. Outer lip is broken. 



Length 4.4, diam. 2.75 mm. 



In our opinion, this is not a Phasianella (Eutropia). 

 It appears to be a rather narrow species of Am-

 text and plates. The text (French edition) bears date of 1853 on the title page, 

 and as d'Orbigny dates the new species 1852, it is likely that the plates were pub- 

 lished in that year, or perhaps that was the date of the Spanish edition.

On the last whorl the ribs become wider downwards, until near 

 the axis they run together. In the intervals two or three low spiral 

 cords may be seen above the much stronger basal cord. There are 

 10 ribs on the last whorl.

Epitonium minutissimum (Gabb) Plate XXXIV, flgs. 10, 11,

Two of the twelve ribs on the last whorl are distinctly larger, both 

 higher and thicker. All bear short points near the suture. In the 

 intervals of the major spirals there are several, usually three, smaller 

 spirals, and the whole is delicately latticed by axial threads.

The shell is imperforate, slender, with about 3| smooth embryonic 

 and 5^ sculptured whorls. Sculpture of thin ribs on the spire, some- 

 what thicker on the last whorl, where there are two varices, one near 

 its beginning, the other on the back. There are about 18 ribs in all 

 on the last whorl. The intervals have sculpture of narrow low spiral 

 cords, with several smaller, less distinct threads between them on 

 the last two whorls. The cords slightly crenulate the posterior edges 

 of the ribs. Aperture short-ovate.

Aclis (Hebetaclis) alta (Gabb) Plate XXVII, fig. 6. 



Auriculina alia Gabb, Trans. Amer. Philos. Soc, XV, 1873, p. 226. 



The surface of this shell is not plain, as stated by Gabb. It is 

 densely covered with slightly waved spiral striae, several of those 

 below the suture being larger. The apex is obtuse, the first whorl 

 being naticoid, glossy and smooth, with nearly level top and the tip 

 a little turned down; subsequent whorls are convex, separated by a 

 narrow, very deeply impressed suture. The thin concave columella 

 passes continuously into the parietal wall. 



Length 3.3, diam. 1.1 mm., 5Â§ whorls. 



The type, no. 3170, is the largest of five specimens. 



The generic position of this graceful and delicate shell is not clear 

 to me, but it has some resemblance to Aclis. The obtuse summit 

 and the small number of relatively long whorls have caused its segre- 

 gation as the type of a new subgenus to be called Hebetaclis. The 

 aperture recalls that of Bcrthais Melvill, but the apical whorls differ. 



PYRAMIDELLIDAE. 



Doctor Bartsch's table of classification 31 has proved indispens- 

 ible in dealing with this group. Unfortunately he has not yet 

 treated of the Antillean species. 



The Santo Domingan Turbonillas all conform pretty closely to 

 modern types, but part of the Odostomias do not fit readily into the 

 tables arranged for recent species. This may be due to our frag- 

 mentary knowledge of the recent Caribbean Odostomias. 



In addition to the species enumerated below, there are some 

 Turbonillas and Odostomias still to be worked out. 



Several species of Turbonilla&nd Odostomia have been described 

 by Miss Maury, Bull. Amer. Pal. V, pp. 147-151, but the figures 

 are so poor that no satisfactory comparisons with our species can 

 be made from them.

Pyramidella canaliculata (Gabb) Plate XXXV, flg. 14. 



Obeliscus canalicvlatus Gabb, Trans. Amer. Philos. Soc, xv, 1873, p. 225. 



The shell is straightly conic. The sutural channel is formed by 

 the excavation of the lower border of each whorl and a narrower 

 excavation of the upper border, which is minutely crenulated just 

 below the suture, and when quite perfectly preserved, at the shoulder 

 angle also, at least on some of the whorls. A little thread just above 

 the suture divides the sutural channel. There is a not very large 

 gutter immediately below the periphery. The whorls are quite flat 

 and plain between the channels. There are three columellar plaits, 

 the upper one wide and subhorizontal. Within the outer lip are 

 four plicae, the lower one small, the upper very small. Umbilicus 

 narrow, circular, bounded by a strong, convex fasciole. 



The largest entire specimen (type) is 9.5 mm. long, 3.5 wide, with 

 12 whorls, the tip of the spire lost. Another shell was larger, diam. 

 4.6 mm., the spire and last whorl broken, three strong teeth within 

 the outer lip. 



Type no. 4080 A. N. S. P. 



Gabb's description and his vial of specimens were composite. 

 The latter contained in addition to the form we select as typical 

 P. canaliculata, specimens of the following species : one Pyramidella 

 jamaicensis, and several Odostomia pyrgulopsis, which were doubt- 

 less put in as young P. canaliculata. 



Gabb's measurements were evidently estimated from what the 

 largest examples would measure if the lip and spire were perfect. 

 We select an immature shell as type, since it accords best with 

 most of his definition. 



There is a Pyramidella canaliculata of Sowerby (Proc. Zool. Soc, 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 391

 brarian of the Zoological Society, that the number of the Proceedings 

 containing this page was published about March, 1874. It was 

 therefore later than Gabb's species. Sowerby's P. canaliculata 

 may be called Pyramidella insularum.

 On the penult whorl there are 20 ribs. On the last whorl the ribs

Turbo dominicensis Gabb, Tr. Amer. Philos. Soc, xv, 1873, p. 242. 



Seven specimens are all imperfect, but the species is well char- 

 acterized. There is a conspicuous, beaded spiral cord below the 

 suture, followed by five minor beaded spirals, alternately smaller 

 and larger; then another prominent cord followed by three minor 

 spirals the middle one larger. At the periphery there is a third 

 larger cord, and below it about 9 spirals, those on the base subequal, 

 and all cut into beads by axial grooves. Around the axial region 

 there is a broad and conspicuous callus. The shell was unusually 

 thin for a Turbo. The specimen selected as type (fig. 16) consists 




396 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART II 



of little more than two whorls. Another (fig. 17) shows the conic 

 spire usual in the genus. 



Diameter of type 25 mm. 



Many opercula of Turbo collected probably belong, at least in 

 part, to this species. Unworn specimens vary remarkably in the 

 degree of callous filling over the nucleus, the number of spiral fur- 

 rows and the amount of granulation ; the series forming a transition 

 from the operculum of Senectus to that of Callopoma. It appears 

 likely that several species of Turbo are involved.

Margarita tricarinata Gabb, Tr. Amer. Philos. Soc, xv, p. 243. 



This minute shell has three strong coarinae in 

 the peripheral region and rounded beads be- 

 low the suture and on the umbilical angle. 

 There are some short radial folds external to 

 the latter. The initial 1| whorls are smooth 

 and rounded. It is obviously a very young 

 shell and possibly belongs to Liotia.

This species resembles C. trilix (Bush), but is much smaller. The 

 unique type measures, alt. 0.9, diam. 1.9 mm.; 3f whorls. The

In a smaller, more perfect specimen found among Gabb's du- 

 plicates, there are more numerous, smaller spirals within the umbili cus 

 (Plate XXXVII, fig. 7). In the type the ribs are worn on the peri- 

 phery, hence appear weaker in the figure than in perfect specimens.

Adeorbis carinata Gabb is thought by Dall to be "probably iden- 

 tical with Vitrinella (Episcynia) inornata Orb." (Trans. Wagner 

 Inst. Ill, 420). This note was overlooked at the time we redescribed 

 the form in 1917. While it is apparently related to that recent spe- 

 cies (which we know only by Orbigny's account and figures), we con- 

 sider it specifically distinct.

Vitrinella (Solariorbis) amosbrowni n. sp. Plate XXXVII, figs. 4, 4a. 



The shell is perforate, conic, of 4| rather rapidly increasing, mod- 

 erately convex whorls, the earlier ones smooth, the penult showing 

 some weak spirals above the suture, the last whorl having about 

 five weak well-spaced spiral cords in the peripheral region, a few 

 still weaker ones traceable above them, and about five smaller, 

 closer spirals below them, occupying all but the central region of 

 the base. Under the compound microscope the surface between 

 the spirals appears densely, irregularly pitted or granose. In the 

 middle part of the base it is finely radially striate and granose. The 

 aperture is somewhat squarish in front view, oblique; the basal lip 

 arches forward a little in a basal view. The peristome is thickened 

 within, the columellar margin strongly so.

The last whorl does not cover the spire completely, as a segment 

 of the suture is exposed, and the rest is visible through the trans- 

 parent last whorl. There seem to be about 2\ whorls. In the last 

 whorl the suture leaves its former course at a right angle and de- 

 scribes a semicircle to the periphery. The last whorl is angular 

 peripherally in front, but becomes rounded at the end. The dome- 

 like upper surface is covered with very fine spiral striae. The axial 

 callus is large, and formed as in Umbonium or Helicina. 



Alt 1.7, diam. 3.7 mm.

This species and the next belong to a section of Teinostoma which 

 may be called Idioraphe, type T. angulatum, characterized by having 

 the whorls enveloping, the suture at first closely coiled, but in the 

 last whorl deviating abruptly. T. cryptospira Verrill is an allied 

 recent species. T. sandomingensis, which we have not seen, is pro- 

 bably near T. angulatum.

This is an Umbonium-like shell of 3f whorls. Faint, close spiral 

 striae may be seen on the upper part of the last whorl under strong 

 magnification. The basal callus is like that of Helicina, its outer 

 edge rather indistinct. There is a thick parietal callus somewhat 

 exaggerated in Gabb's figure.

Dall has identified Gabb's species with the recent N. crenulata, 

 which appears to be typically much more coarsely sculptured. As 

 the numerous specimens from Santo Domingo are very uniform in 

 sculpture it seems possible that they form a recognizable race or 

 perhaps a species. 



N. tenuisculpta is finely wrinkled concentrically, and radially 

 closely striate, the striae appearing as gray lines, which so far as we 

 can tell are little if at all impressed. Internal border finely crenu- 

 lated. The largest of numerous valves measures, length 3.35, alt.

There are twelve large valves of this species in the Gabb collec- 

 tion from Santo Domingo (no. 2720, 2721), two from 20 miles west 

 of Azua, Haiti, collected by Mr. Lloyd B. Smith (no. 2662), and 

 nine from near Cartagena, Colombia (no. 2661), also taken by Mr. 

 Smith. We formerly thought that the fossils of the Caribbean area 

 were separable from A . grandis of the recent Panamic Province, but 

 a close study of all the material shows that no separation can be 

 made. 33 



While somewhat related to A. chiriquiensis Gabb, this species 

 differs in shape and by the smaller number of ribs, 24 to 26; chiri- 

 quiensis having 28 to 30. They are larger, and remain better de- 

 veloped on the posterior dorsal slope. The shell is nearly equi- 

 valve, extremely large, solid and heavy, The posterior lower angle 

 is produced, anterior end rounded, basal margin nearly straight. 

 The beaks are extremely large, giving the shell a triangular con- 

 tour, and projecting far above the hinge. Cardinal area very broad, 

 in form of a nearly symmetrical triangle, being scarcely or not longer 

 posteriorly than in front of the beaks; marked with grooves meeting 

 at a wide angle (but in adults usually eroded, showing the striation 

 derived from growth of the teeth). Sculpture of 25 strong radial 

 ribs, the anterior ones slightly granulated (this is more obvious in 

 the young) ; the granules, transverse, rather widely and unevenly 

 spaced. Intercostal spaces show rather sharp growth-striae. The 



33 Mr. Gabb reached the same conclusion; but as he included A. chiriquiensis, 

 and thought A. tolepia the young, his decision has not influenced the opinion ex- 

 pressed above. 



It maybe noted that J. C. Moore identified A. grandis, with some doubt, from 

 Mr. Heneken's second sending of Santo Domingo fossils, in Q. J. Geol. Soc, ix, 

 1853.

 being curved down a little at the posterior end. Basal margin very 

 coarsely fluted within.

The figures represent a type (Plate XL, fig. 2) and paratype (Plate 

 XL, figs. 3) . Plate XLI, figs. 1-3 are other specimens from the black- 

 ish shale at Chiriqui. It is equivalve, and the valves are alike ex- 

 cept that two or three more of the ribs are granulose in the left valve 

 than in the right. The prominent beaks are moderately to widely 

 separated by a broad, flat cardinal area marked with some angulate 

 grooves. The valves convex before the middle, flattened or even 

 very little concave behind it; about 10 posterior ribs in the left valve, 

 12 in the right, are nearly smooth, the rest being closely, or some- 

 times somewhat sparsely, granose. The ribs are weak on the pos- 

 terior slope. Intervening grooves are irregularly marked with 

 growth striae. 



Length 43, alt. 43 mm.; 29 ribs. 



Length 40, alt. 34, diam. 36 mm.; 30 ribs. 



Length 73, alt. 70mm.; 31 ribs (largest). 



Gabb subsequently considered A. chiriquiensis a synonym of 

 A. grandis, but it is not even closely related. 



The granulation is best developed in young or half-grown ex- 

 amples becoming more or less obsolete in old ones. Th,e degree of 

 separation of the beaks also varies. The lot of about 40 examples 

 from Chiriqui, collected by Dr. John Evans, shows but little other 

 variation. 



Santo Domingan specimens (Plate XL, figs 4, 5, 6) are less ex- 

 tensively granose and the beaks are less widely apart than in many 

 of the type lot, though agreeing with others. The concavity be- 

 hind the middle is slightly more marked. All of the specimens are 

 somewhat worn. 



Length 55, alt. 51, diam. of right valve 23 mm. 



Length 35, alt. 33, diam. 36 mm. 



Besides the above (no. 2722 Gabb Coll., numerous specimens), 

 some fragments were obtained by Mr. W. W. Webster on a stream 

 between Las Caobas and Hinche, Haiti. 



It appears likely that this species is the lost Area patricia of 




406 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART II 



Sowerby, which has also been identified with A . grandis. It agrees 

 better than any other Santo Domingan species with the brief and 

 inconclusive diagnosis of that shell. Sowerby states that his species 

 has "rather more numerous" ribs than A. grandis, and that it "is 

 much more rounded at the inferior margin", "margine inferiori ro~ 

 tundato". As far as it goes, this applies to A. chiriquiensis; yet as 

 no definite information on the type specimen is available, the name 

 given by Gabb is preferred, since there is no doubt about its iden- 

 tity.

This is one of the most abundant arks. By Gabb the specimens 

 were referred to A . grandis as young. It is somewhat variable. From 

 the adhering material it is evident that several beds are represent- 

 ed. 



Three forms seem to be distinguishable, additional to the typical 

 form. Whether these are species, or successive or synchronous mu- 

 tations of A . tolepia, cannot be determined until their stratigraphic 

 place is known. 



A . arthurpennelli Maury appears to be based upon part of Gabb 's 

 specimens. It may be distinct from tolepia, described from Rio 

 Amina.

This small, plump shell has triangular rounded contour, the an- 

 terior end narrowly, the posterior broadly rounded. Sculpture of 

 many radial ribs crossed by concentric threads over ribs and inter- 

 vals. In the median fourth the ribs widen towards the basal border 

 and the intervals remain simple, but over the rest of the valve inter- 

 stitial riblets arise in the intervals, about midway, and many of them 

 become as large as the primary ribs near the basal margin. The 

 cardinal area is narrow and smooth. Tooth row continuous, with 

 9 and 11 teeth, those of the posterior part strongly oblique, in the 

 anterior part slightly oblique.

PECTINIDAE. 



A single specimen identified by Gabb as Pecten magnificus Sby. 

 (p. 256) appears to be P. nodosus L., as Dr. Dall has stated (Trans. 

 Wagn. Inst. III). It retains the color almost as in a living shell. 

 We are much disposed to think that it may be Pleistocene. The 




410 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART II 



shell was not collected by Gabb personally, and nothing is known of 

 its stratigraphic position. 



Doctor Dall has recorded Pecten cactaceus Dall from "Tertiary 

 of Santo Domingo, Gabb"; but the species is not represented in 

 this collection. The same is true of Pecten (Plagioctenium) gabbi 

 Dall. 



Pecten soror (Gabb) Plate XLIV, figs. 1, 2. 



Janira soror Gabb, Trans. Amer. Philos. Soc. xv, 1873., p. 257. 



Gabb 's description was from right and left valves of two individ- 

 uals. His measurement is from the concave valve catalogued under 

 no. 2862, which may be considered type. It has about 19 rounded 

 ribs (not counting a few very faint ones on the submargins) parted 

 by wider intervals, the whole elegantly sculptured with close, reg- 

 ular and delicate concentric laminae (fig. 2). Alt. 47 mm. 



The convex valve has 23 strong ribs, slightly wider than their in- 

 tervals, somewhat flattened, and with similar concentric sculpture. 



Length 42.5, alt. 40.5, convexity 14.5 mm. 



There are also valves of several smaller individuals showing the 

 same characters.

 Pecten eugrammaticus Dall, Trans. Wagn. Inst, iii, p. 712, pi. 34, fig. 2. 



The characteristic sculpture of this species has been well though 

 briefly described by Sowerby, in terms which preclude the identifi- 

 cation of thetidis with a species of the exasperatus group, by Guppy 

 and Dall. 



The shell is rather convex, slightly inequilateral, with 21 ribs 

 separated by V-shaped furrows. Except near the ends the ribs are 

 square-topped, having flat or furrowed summits and more or less 

 flange-like edges bearing unequal asperities. There is a beautiful 

 sculpture of fine, nearly regular concentric threads over the furrows 

 and slopes of the ribs. Submargins nearly or quite ribless. Ears 

 are small, and have about 5 slender ribs. No ctenolium. 



Length and alt. 24 mm. 



The species here defined and figured is the only one in the large 

 series which agrees with the Sowerby diagnosis. Gabb's collec- 

 tion covered the ground where the Heneken shells were obtained, and 

 contains practically all of the Heneken species, so that it may fairly 

 be inferred that the only species fulfilling the requirements of the 

 original diagnosis is the true thetidis. It is not an uncommon shell, 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 411 



and varies rather widely in the degree of development of the rib- 

 ornamentation. 



In a form of this species which may be called Pecten thetidis pelei 

 (Plate XLIV, figs. 4, 5 ) the ribs have wider summits, more strongly 

 developed spinose flanges, and on the slopes of the ribs there are 

 one or two spinose riblets. The submargins and ears have a close 

 sculpture of spinose riblets. Alt. and length 28, semidiam. 11 mm.

Pecten interlineatus Gabb. Plate XLV, fig. 3.

On the left valve there are 15 or 16 rounded and not very high 

 major ribs, a riblet running in each interval; close to the base there 

 are two or three in each interval. Anterior submargin with about six 

 riblets, posterior ribs and riblets are granose. The anterior ear 

 has few fine riblets, posterior ear coarse ribs. There is a fine con- 

 centric sculpture of regular hair-lines, but more or less wholly worn 

 from the summits of the ribs. The right valve is a trifle less convex 

 with the same sculpture except that both ears have fine riblets. 

 Four well-developed teeth in the short ctenolium.

A series of 26 valves seems to be referable to Sowerby 's species. 

 Doctor Dall has shown that neither of the specimens now pre- 

 served in the typical tray of Sowerby 's collection agree with the 

 diagnosis. 



The 18 or 19 ribs have either distinctly angular or very narrowly 

 rounded summits. There are fine, thread-like concentric striae. 

 Submargins plain. The left valve is more convex than the right. 

 There is no ctenolium.

Peten augusticostatus Gabb, Plate XLV, figs. 7, 8. 



Pecten augusticostatus Gabb, Trans. Amer. Philos. Soc. xv, 1873, p. 256. 



The sole specimen of this species is a left valve. It has 22 ribs. 

 These are very high and acute, in section like an inverted V. Their 

 slopes and intervals have an extremely fine, regular raised concentric 

 striation. The anterior submargin has several very low ribs, and 

 there are a few delicate riblets on the adjacent ear. 



Length 24.3, alt. 23.8, convexity 8 mm. 



Type no. 2866 A. N. S. P. 



While this species is closely related to the preceding, it should 

 be retained distinct until connecting specimens are found. It 

 differs by the more numerous, far sharper ribs, the low ribs on the 

 anterior submargin, the greater convexity, and the finer concentric 

 striation. 



There cannot be much doubt that the name as printed is an 

 error for augusticostatus. Gabb was in Costa Rica when his paper 

 was printed, and did not see the proofs.

This is an abundant Aequipecten in the collection. It is nearly 

 equilateral, distinctly inequivalve. There are rounded ribs and 

 concave intervals in both valves, the ribs in the left valve as wide 

 as the intervals, in the right valve decidedly narrower. The great- 

 est number of specimens have 19 ribs; many have 20 and the ex- 

 tremes, represented by a few, are 18 and 22 ribs. A very fine con- 

 centric sculpture of hair-like threads runs over both ribs and in- 

 tervals, but is usually a good deal worn. 



Length 38.5, alt. 37.3 mm. 



The figures represent both valves of one individual. So far as we 

 know, the species has been found only in Santo Domingo.

Externally this species has an extreme- 

 ly minute, irregular but dense puncta- 

 tion, the pits more or less anastomosing, 

 forming a sort of network where most 

 perfectly preserved. There is some vari- 

 ation in contour, some examples having 

 the anterior end less rounded than that 

 figured. The largest valve (figured) 

 measures, length 5.6, alt. 5.4, diam. 1.65 

 mm. 



Type is no. 2693 A. N. S. P. 

 We have not compared specimens of the Bowden D. puncturella 

 Dall, which from the description and figure appears not to differ 

 from gabbi. Dall had not seen the latter, apparently.

Mysia capuloides Gabb, Trans. Amer. Philos. Soc, xv, 1873, p. 252. 



The shell is much inflated, with sculpture of very minute, but well 



developed concentric striae. Beaks large and prominent. The 



right anterior and posterior cardinal teeth are both bifid. The edge 



of the valve is noticeably reflected upward above the cardinal teeth. 



Length 5.2, alt. 5, semidiam. 2.4 mm.

 On account of the inflated form and peculiar hinge this species

la, 46, are redrawn. The valve shown in fig 45 a, 6, c, may be taken 

 as type of the species and genus. The lateral teeth described and 

 figured by Gabb do not exist, the surfaces where they would stand 

 being flat. The hinges of small Leptonid bivalves are hard to make 

 out, and we attribute Gabb 's mistake to the use of a low-power hand 

 lens, instead of the compound microscope. 



The external surface shows an extremely minute radial rugosity, 

 or irregular lineolation, under high magnification. Concentric 

 sculpture is very slight. The prodissoconch has a circular outline, 

 like that of Sportella (fig. e) . 



Length 6.2, alt. 4.2 mm. (Fig. 45 a) . 



It is plain that the species is not a typical Erycina; the hinge being 

 more like Pseudopythina or Sportella. Not being expert in the study 

 of Leptonacea, the species is left under the original generic name.

The ribs, except on the posterior slope, are smooth and rounded, 

 separated by narrow grooves. On the anterior end the ribs show- 

 small erect processes or the scars where they have been. There are 

 also quite small processes along the posterior sides of the rest of the 

 ribs, nearly all worn off. On the posterior area each rib is split, 

 alternate ones of the resulting riblets bearing erect, oblique pro- 

 cesses. The posterior end is deeply serrate, each primary rib pro- 

 jecting. There are about 54 primary ribs. 



The whole basal margin is broken away, so that the true length 

 does not show in the figure. The type measures : length 38, alt. 44 

 (estimated), diam. of one valve 15 mm. 



Several young shells are more rounded in outline, and the ribs are 

 very closely spinose towards the margins. The posterior ribs show 

 only a trace of splitting. (No. 2769 A. N. S. P.).

 The shell is longer than high, transversely oval, with very convex, 

 but somewhat narrow and markedly prosogyrate beaks, which 

 project far more above the hinge outline than in C. serratum. The 

 anterior and posterior areas are smooth, the median portion finely 

 ribbed, the ribs low, flattened, much wider than the intervals, which 

 are closely and finely striated transversely. There are about 50 ribs. 

 The right anterior cardinal tooth is peg-like, higher than the poste- 

 rior. Lateral teeth compressed, the posterior, especially, much 

 thinner than in C. serratum.

Length 33, alt. 31, diam. of one valve 13 mm.

This species has been placed in the synonymy of C. serratum, but 

 it seems to me distinct by the far larger beaks, of a different shape, 

 and the differences in the teeth. In C. serratum the beaks are much 

 wider and lower, even in specimens of far greater size. The sculp- 

 ture described may possibly be due to disintegration of the outer 

 layer, though we see no evidence that this is the case.

This shell is not unlike the recent P. fulminata Mke. (varians 

 Hanley), but is thinner, a little plumper, with the beaks turned for- 

 ward a little more. The sculpture is of very fine, close, even and 

 smooth concentric threads, which are flattened and wider in the 

 median part, where unworn; the beaks smooth in the median con- 

 vexity. The lunule is defined by a weakly impressed line.

 An imperfect internal cast in a hard rock, no. 2788, resembles this

 possibly represent Gabb's T. punicea. No specimens were found 

 under that name in the collection.

 There is a set of T. alternata in the collection labelled "U. S." 

 possibly from Santo Domingo or Costa Rica, but without Gabb's 

 MS. label. We cannot, therefore, confirm or reject Gabb's record. 

 This and T. punicea are the only species mentioned by Gabb which 

 we have not been able to trace in the collection.

NOTES ON HEMIBRANCHIATE AND LOPHOBRANCHIATE FISHES. 



By Henry W. Fowler. 



The fishes belonging to the above-named groups contained in 

 the collection of the Academy are listed in this paper. Besides 

 notes on variation, interesting records are given for some species 

 for the first time, and two species are described as new. 



GASTEROSTEIDAE. 

 Spinachia spinachia (Linne) 



British Isles and Sweden. 



Pungitius pungitius (Linne) 



Europe, Sweden, Rostock in Germany, Magdalen Islands, 

 Massachusetts, Salem, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey. 

 My largest examples show: Head 3f to 4; depth 5f to 6; D. 

 ix, often x, rarely xi, 9 or 10; A. i, 9, often 10; length 62 to 70 mm. 

 In the entire series the dorsal shows mostly x, often ix, seldom or 

 rarely viii or xi. In view of the great variation of these spines, 

 even as low as n have been given by some authors, it is not pos- 

 sible to use them as distinctive characters. The Japanese Pygo- 

 steus steindachneri Jordan and Snyder and P. undecimalis Jordan 

 and Starks are nominal forms supposed to be distinguished chiefly 

 according to their dorsal spines, and may therefore be merged 

 in the synonymy. Gasterosteus pungitius brachypoda Bean has 

 been placed as the Greenland representative, on the alleged char- 

 acter of its short ventral spine, which is a little less than half of 

 the head. None of my examples shows the ventral spine more than 

 half of the head, and most of them much less. In the young or 

 small examples, these spines are quite short or small. It is there- 

 fore quite likely Pungitius pungitius is entirely circumpolar. 



Gasterosteus aculeatus Linne. 



Prince Edward Island, Magdalen Islands, Halifax, in Nova Scotia, 

 Maine, Long Island, New Jersey, Virginia. Many from the Medi- 

 terranean, Lago Nemi and Italy as var. brachycentrus. This large 

 series of all ages shows great variation, individual as well as geo- 

 graphical. It is impossible to clearly define the latter. All the

Mediterranean and Italian specimens are naked or partly armed. 

 They show usually 4 plates, less frequently to 5. In young ex- 

 amples from Prince Edward Island the armature is often incomplete, 

 and the long ventral spines slender, frequently extending even Â£ 

 beyond the pubic process or even twice length of the dorsal spines. 

 All my Canadian examples have the armature less complete, or 

 less in depth than in New Jersey specimens. This may, however, 

 be due to age, as my largest ones are somewhat less than Long 

 Island and New Jersey material. The Canadian specimens all 

 agree with the Virginian examples, all of which are uniformly 

 small. They have variously long or short spines. All show but 

 a single ventral ray. The characters given by Jordan and Ever- 

 mann for the nominal American forms 1 are entirely fallacious and 

 my specimens violate all their alleged distinctions. 



Gasterosteus aculeatus cataphractus (Pallas) 



G. microcephalus Girard, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1854, p. 133. Four 

 Creek, San Joaquin Valley, Cal. 



Nos. 14,275 to 14,289, A. N. S. P., cotypes of G. microcephalus 

 Girard. Others from San Francisco and Oakland, California; 

 Puget Sound; Alaska. The distinctions given by Jordan and 

 Evermann for this nominal form, â€” its robust form and longer spines, 

 do not hold. A nearly equal variation is found in my Pacific 

 specimens as in the Atlantic, and the present form is only admitted 

 nominally. 



Eucalia inconstans (Kirtland) 



Gasterosteus micropus Cope, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1865, p. 81. Fort 

 Riley, Kansas. 



Nos. 14,184 and 14,185, A. N. S. P., cotypes of G. micropus Cope. 

 Others from New York, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Iowa and' Minne- 

 sota. They show D. v, rarely vi, unsually 10, often 9, sometimes 

 8 and rarely 7 or 11; A. i, 9 or 10, rarely 7, 8 or 11; ventral spine 

 \ to l+i; length 24 to 65 mm. 



Apeltes quadracus (Mitchill) 



Prince Edward Island, Magdalen Islands, Maine, Rhode Island, 

 Long Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Mary- 

 land. This large series shows a wider range of variation than is 

 usually credited to the dorsal spines. Seven examples have in, 152 

 have iv, 283 have v, and 9 have vi. These spines are all very 



1 Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., no. 47. pt. 1. 1896. p. 746. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA 439 



variable in length, position and projection. In only one case were 

 2 closely situated spines found at the soft dorsal origin, the rays of 

 the fin ranging 10 to 12. Only a single oval spine in all the 

 examples, the rays 7 to 10. A young Delaware example shows un- 

 usually short or hardly developed innominate bones. The color 

 pattern is also extremely variable, and in no two examples exactly 

 alike. 



Four examples Cope reported in 1865 2 , labeled as having been 

 brought from Sukertoppem, Greenland, by Dr. I. I. Hayes, 

 are not Eucalia inconstans, with which he sought to identify them. 

 I subsequently wrongly referred four examples, labeled "Godhavn, 

 Disco Island, Davis Straits" from Dr. I. I. Hayes 3 to Gasterosteus 

 aculeatus, which suggests they may have changed labels. 



AULOSTOMIDAE. 

 Aulostomus maculatus Valenciennes. 



Two from Santa Cruz, W. I. Eye 2\ to 2f in postorbital. 



Aulostomus chinensis (Linn6) 



Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands, Oahu, Pacific Ocean. Eye 2\ to 

 2f in postorbital. 



FISTULARIIDAE. 



Fistularia tabacaria Linne. 



Manasquan, Ocean City, Beesley's Point, Angelsea, N. J.; Rio 

 Janeiro, Brazil; Trinidad W. I.; Banda Point, West Africa. This 

 material shows the variations quite extensively. The characters 

 pointed out by Jordan and Starks in their distinctions for F. 

 petimba and F. depressa are in some instances covered by my mate- 

 rial. However the median ridges on the snout above are slightly 

 divergent anteriorly. In all cases the skin is smooth. 



Fistularia petimba Lacepede. 



Hawaiian and Philippine Islands. I have not found any struc- 

 tural differences for this species, in attempting to distinguish it 

 from the preceding. "Upper lateral edges of snout with few 

 serrations or none" as given by Jordan and Evermann for their F. 

 tabacaria in comparison with "upper lateral edges of snout sharply 

 serrated" for F. petimba, are surely worthless. The blue spots for 



2 Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1865, p. 81. 

 â€¢ L. c. 1914, p. 365. 




440 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Part III 



F. tabacaria are not found in any of my preserved specimens, either 

 old or recent, apparently soon fading after death. My examples 

 of F. petimba are smooth. All show the hind portion of the lateral 

 line armed with firm plates, only less developed in the young, and 

 in small examples some apparently affected by formaline. The 

 same is true of F. tabacaria. The examples of F. petimba all agree 

 in a slightly less deeply depressed interorbital, with narrower sup- 

 raorbitals. Even some of the examples of F. tabacaria show a 

 similar condition, and this is hardly a likely character for distinction. 



MACRORHAMPHOSIDAE. 

 Macrorhamphosus scolopax (Linne) 



Head If to 2f; depth 3f to 4Â£; snout If to 3f in head; 

 eye 2\ to 4| in snout; D. v or vi â€” 11 or 12; A. 18 or 19. All show 

 great variation in the length of the dorsal spine, as in some it does 

 not depress much beyond the soft dorsal and in others it extends 

 beyond the caudal tips. Its armature also quite variable, though 

 usually distinct. In smaller or young examples obsolete or only 

 few denticles. Young also have shorter snouts, deeper basally. 

 Length 27 to 158 mm. Twenty-six from Italy. 



Jordan and Starks state they have compared their M . sagifue with 

 two specimens of the present species from the Canaries. They con- 

 tend M. sagifue differs "in being a little more slender and in having 

 a slightly smaller eye and longer snout." All these characters are, 

 however, covered by my material, as the note above will show. 

 Though they fail to note the length of their type it appears to 

 measure according to their figure, about 115 mm. The correct 

 distinctions therefore remain unknown for the nominal M. sagifue. 

 None of my specimens appears to represent M . gracilis (Lowe) as 

 described by Gunther. It is said to have the body depth 2f to 3 

 in space between opercle and caudal base, which is If to 2\ in my 

 specimens. A further distinction is the alleged weak armature of 

 the dorsal spine. 



Macrorhamphosus scolopax elevatus (Waite) 



Head 2^; depth 4f, or 2\ from gill-opening to caudal base; 

 dorsal spine well armed, not depressible beyond soft dorsal. Victoria. 



Centriscops humerosus (Richardson) 



One from Victoria, Australia, 110? mm. (caudal damaged). 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA 441 



CENTRISCIDAE. 



Centriscus scutatus Linne. 



One without data. 



Centriscus strigatus (Gunther) 



One without data. Aeoliscus Jordan and Starks, based on this 

 species, would appear only of sub-generic rank. 



PEGASIDAE. 



Parapegasus natans (Linne) 



Padang, Sumatra. 



SYNGNATHIDAE. 



Entelurus aequoreus (LinnÂ§) 



Osphyolax pellucidus Cope, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1875, p. 450, PI. 

 25, figs. 1-4. Open Atlantic Ocean. 



No. 860, A. N. S. P., type of 0. pellucidus Cope. Duncker has 

 correctly placed this nominal form as a synonym of Syngnathus 

 aequoreus LinnÂ£ 4 and although the type has been overlooked until 

 now, its identity is unquestioned. It is, however, still in good 

 preservation and shows: Rings 29+62?; D. 37, on 8" +3 rings; head 

 4f to vent; vent about opposite last third in dorsal base. Length 

 283 mm. On the basis of the very general type locality this species 

 could hardly be included in the North American ichthyfauna. 



Cope gives "thirty-one transverse rows of scuta" though my 

 count shows the above formula. Also he says " dorsal radii sixteen, " 

 his figure showing 18, whereas there are actually 37. Also he gives 

 "total length 23 m.," while his specimen is actually 283 mm. long. 



Nerophis macula tus Raflnesque. 



Rings 21 or 22 +50 to 67; D. 21 to 25, on 2 or 3 +5 rings. Three 

 from Italy. 



Gastrotokeus biaculeatus (Bloch) 



Bacon and Philippines. 



Doryrhamphinarum lineatum (Valenciennes) 



Santo Domingo, W. I. Duncker sets aside Doryrhamphinarum 

 Kaup 5 . Kaup included Syngnathus heterosoma Bleeker monoty- 

 pically, and such is here acknowledged as its type. It therefore 

 supersedes Microphis as used by Duncker.

Doryrhamphinarum brachyurum (Bleeker) 



Rings 21 or 22+22 to 25; D. 38 to 43, on 1 or 2+7 or 8 rings. 

 Eleven from Tahiti. 



Corythoichthys fasciatus (Gray) 



C. elerae Evermann and Seale, Bull. U. S. Bur. Fisher., 26, 1906 (1907), p. 

 57, fig. 2. 



No. 33,252, A. N. S. P. , paratype of C. elerae Evermann and Seale. 



Corythoichthys conspicillatus (Jenyns) 



Rings 16+40; D. 31 to 33, on 6 rings. Twelve from Tahiti. 

 Corythoichthys albirostris Kaup. 



Rings 16+32; D. 28, on 4+5 rings. Marco, Lee County, Florida. 



Micrognathus jonesi (Giinther) 



Rings 15 or 16 +37 or 38; D. 25, on 1 +3 or 4 rings. Three from 

 Anclote Bay and three from Point Pinellos, west coast of Florida, 

 both obtained by Prof. Angelo Heilprin in 1886. This species has 

 not previously been recorded from the coast of the United States. 

 These examples show fewer body rings and more caudal rings than 

 the Porto Rican material reported by Evermann and Marsh. 



Compared with Syngnathus elucens the present species differs 

 in the median lateral ridge continuous with the lower caudal ridge, 

 and the lower lateral trunk ridges end abruptly close before begin- 

 ning of the lower lateral caudal ridge. 



Syngnathus spicifer Ruppell. 



Philippines. Rings 16+40; D. 26, on 7 body rings. This example 

 agrees in most every respect with Ruppell's figure and description. 

 It has upper right body and caudal keels continuous, though a little 

 deflected below the dorsal base. Along this latter area an auxiliary 

 short superior parallel keel. As the color has faded the usual dark 

 abdominal cross-bands are not evident. 



Syngnathus matterni (Fowler) â™¦ 



Corythroichthys matterni Fowler, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1918, p. 11, fig. 

 5. Philippines. 



Type, No. 47,484, A. N. S. P., of C. matterni Fowler. In the 

 original account the misleading statement "this species differs 

 from the preceding chiefly in its greatly elongated tail and shorter 

 snout," refers to the specimen of S. spicifer, its reference having 

 been deleted from my paper. Abdomen pale brownish, but with 

 indistinct cross-bars. 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA 443 



Syngnathus elucens Poey. 



Marquesas and Big Pine Keys, Florida. Rings 16 to 18+28 to 

 33 ; D. 28 to 30, in 3 or 4 +4 or 5 rings. Length 55 to 1 17 mm. 



Syngnathus schlegelii Kaup. 



Yokohama and Otaru, Japan. Rings 19 or 20+40 to 43; D. 34 

 to 39, on 1+8 to 10 rings. Largest 229 mm. 



Syngnathus californiensis Storer. 



S. griseolineatus Ayres, Proc. Cal. Acad. Sci., 1854., p. 14. San Fran- 

 cisco Bay. 



No. 835, A. N. S. P., type of S. griseolineatus Ayres. In 

 very poor condition. Other examples from Monterey and Cali- 

 fornia, and Willamette River, Oregon. Rings 19 to 21 +42 to 52; 

 D. 37 to 44, on 1+8 to 10 rings. 



Jordan and Evermann say S. griseolineatus Ayres differs in a 

 somewhat shorter snout, number of dorsal rays and rings, more 

 keeled snout and dorsal covering or 1+9 rings. My material all 

 appears to be S. californiensis and the type of S. griseolineatus 

 has at least 18 body rings and not one of the other specimens show 

 less than 19. 



Syngnathus pelagicus I Jim.'. 



Many examples; 5 labeled "Delaware Bay"; N. Lat. 24Â° 21' West 

 Long. 34Â° 32'; N. Lat. 23Â° 20' West Long. 57Â° 29'; N. Lat. 23Â° 59' W. 

 Long. 37Â° 59'; Lake George, Florida. Rings 16 or 17+29 to 32; 

 D. 28 to 33, on 2 to 4+4 to 7 rings. All this material is charac- 

 terized by the vertical white lines on the trunk, one on each ring 

 inferiorly. 



Jordan and Evermann place this species in their key under the 

 group with "dorsal covering 4 or 5 body rings" and immediately 

 below as "on 1+9 rings." In only one example (Lake George) 

 have I found the dorsal on 4+4 rings. I cannot find Siphostoma 

 scovelli Evermann and Kendall is distinct, and in fact its alleged 

 distinctions are covered by the variations in my material. 



Syngnathus fuscus (Storer) 



Massachusetts, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia. 

 Also one labeled "Neuse River, North Carolina." Rings 17 to 20 

 +36 to 40; D. 32 to 40, on 4 to 6+4 to 6 rings. Largest 240 mm. 



Syngnathus mackayi Swain and Meek. 



Marquesas and Big Pine Keys, Florida. Rings 17 or 18+31 to 

 35; D. 29 to 31 on 1 to 3 +5 to 7 rings. Largest 160 mm.

Syngnathus louisianae (Giinther) 



Marquesas and Big Pine Keys, Hailer's Rock, West Palm Beach 

 and Pensacola, Florida. Rings 20 to 23+35 or 36; D. 33 or 34, on 

 3 or 4 +4 to 6 rings. Largest 283? mm. 



Syngnathus acus Linne. 



Italy and Sweden. Rings 15 to 20+33 to 43; D. 33 to 39, on 1 to 

 3+6 to 9 rings. Largest 333 mm. In most upper lateral caudal 

 keel continuous with median lateral keel of trunk.

Typhlinus typhle (Linn6) 



Italy and Gulf of Spisia. 



Stigmatophora argus (Richardson) 



One from "Fiji" wrongly identified by me as S. nigra Kaup. 

 Rings 19 +48?; D. 42, on 8 +6 rings. Likely this specimen is actually 

 from Australia. 



Leptonotus tristriatus n. sp. Fig. 1. 



Head 2f to vent; depth 11; D. 42, on 3+8 rings, P. 12; rings 

 21+40? (tail damaged); snout about 1\ in head; eye 2| in post- 

 orbital region. 



Body elongated, slender, well compressed, and apparently deepest 

 midway in trunk, and combined head and trunk at least less than 

 tail. Upper keels on each side of back extend back to seventh 

 caudal ring. This replaced by similar parallel keel, beginning on 

 last trunk ring and entirely continuous posteriorly. Median 

 lateral keel from pectoral axis, and ends on last keel of trunk. 

 Median belly keel complete from breast to vent. Lower keel along 

 each side of body complete. 



Head slender, attenuate, compressed, upper profile nearly straight. 

 Snout greatly longer than rest of head. Eye rounded, small, though 

 now little left but orbital rim, which at least f of head depth at 

 that point. Mouth .small, terminal. Interorbital flat. Opercle 

 without horizontal keel and fine striae radiating above and below. 



Gill-opening? 



Rings firm, and keels without spines. Each ring with numerous 

 fine striae, vertical on plates.

Dorsal origin well before vent, fin small and rays rather short. Anal 

 very small. Pectoral half length of postocular region. 



Color in alcohol largely faded dull brownish. Back dull brown, 

 with obscure paler dots or minute rounded spots. Dorsal pale 

 brown. Brown band along side of snout to eye, and continued back 

 over opercle and upper side of back, gradually merging in color of 

 latter before dorsal. Median narrow streak of same color on upper 

 surface of snout, continued over upper surface of head to predorsal, 

 and much narrower than lateral head bands, or across interorbital 

 about one-third its width. All these bands on head with margins 

 darker or as if bordered with dusky-brown lines. 



Length about 136 mm., measured to end of broken tail. 



Type, No. 33,136, A. N. S. P. Fiji. Mrs. Agnes F. Kenyon. 



Fig. 1. â€” Leptonotus tristriatus n. sp. 



This species is related to Leptonotus norae Waite 6 in the number of 

 its rings and length of its snout. It differs, however, markedly in 

 color-pattern. Originally I wrongly recorded this species as Syng- 

 nathus semistriatus (Kaup), a species which it appeared to re- 

 semble in structure, though it also differs strikingly in color-pattern. 



(Tri, three; stria, stripe; for the color-pattern chiefly on the head.) 



Solenognathus guntheri Duncker. 



Rings 25 or 26+56 or 57; D. 40? to 43? Two adults from Victoria, 

 Australia, and two without data. They all agree with S. hardwickii 

 Waite 7 , which has been named S. guntheri by Duncker. 



Phyllopteryx foliatus (Shaw) 



Two males and 4 females from Portland, Victoria. Syngnatus 

 taeniloatus Lacepede 8 is synchronous with Shaw. 



Hippocampus hippocampus (Linne) 



Italy and Port Mahon, Minorca. D. 16 to 19, on 3+1 rings; 

 rings 12+35 or 36. Also a number of dried examples without data.

 preceding, and may not eventually prove to be distinct. The 

 specimens fail to show any tangible structural characters and the 

 variations are in most every way conformable. Both have a similar 

 general style of. coloration, even to the dark median ventral keel and 

 submarginal dark band on the dorsal. The female likewise shows 

 the vent in a dark area.

THE CHROMITE DEPOSITS OF THE STATE LINE SERPENTINES. 1 



By Samuel G. Gordon. 



The chromite deposits described below occur in a belt of ser- 

 pentine situated on the Pennsylvania-Maryland line, in Lancaster 

 and Chester counties, Pennsylvania, and Cecil County, Maryland. 

 In the last century the district was an important producer 

 of chromite, and during the recent war attempts were made to re- 

 open the mines, but with little success. Aside from economic 

 considerations, the deposits are of considerable scientific interest, 

 as the data regarding chromite deposits are rather meager, beyond 

 the fact that they appear to be true magmatic segregations without 

 the aid of "mineralizers." 



General Geology. 



The geology of the district has been described by Rogers 2 , 

 Chester 3 , Frazer 4 , and Bascom 5 . The serpentines of the belt 

 represent hydrothermal-metamorphosed peridotites and pyroxen- 

 ites, part of an igneous complex forming a large batholithic mass 

 overlain on the north by mica gneisses. The following interesting 

 petrographic succession is exhibited in passing northwestward 

 across the batholith-biotite-grandiorite, hornblende-biotite-grano- 

 diorite, quartz-biotite-hornblende-g abbro, quartz-hornblende-gab- 

 bro, hornblende-norite and quartz-norite, norite, pyroxenite, and 

 peridotite. The main types are considered by F. Bascom to re- 

 present differentiation of the magma before intrusion, while their 

 gradations are thought to represent subsequent differentiation. 



1 The writer is indebted to Dr. Edgar T. Wherry for a critical review 

 of the manuscript, and to Mr. F. Lynwood Garrison for various courtesies 

 extended to him during his visit to the district in April and August, 1920. The 

 albitites were described in a previous article in these proceedings, and an account 

 of the minerals of the district will appear in The American Mineralogist.

Chromite Deposits. 



The chromite deposits occur exclusively in the meta-pyroxenite 

 and meta-periodotite area. The principal mines, now all abandoned, 

 are listed below, with their reputed production. 6 



Line Pit, three-quarters of a mile northwest of Rock Springs 

 cross-roads, Maryland; 1,000 tons. This chromite body presents 

 a number of unusual features, and is in some respects the most 

 remarkable deposit in the district. 



The deposit may be described as a rough, irregular cylindrical 

 mass, with the average diameters of 5 by 8 feet, which has been 

 worked to a depth of about 250 feet. The chromite body pitches 

 S 75Â° E at an angle of about 60Â°. 



This rough cylindrical mass is surrounded by a thick sheathing 

 of a translucent green, jade-like serpentine known as williamsite, 

 averaging about a foot in thickness, beyond which lie the ordinary 

 types of serpentine. Thick tabular masses of williamsite form 

 partings in the chromite deposit, while veins of it may extend 

 into the serpentine walls. Fractures in the chromite are filled 

 . with clinochlore or kammererite. Many veins of magnesite, 

 containing residual masses of green serpentine, were found cutting 

 the chromite deposit and the serpentine in the lower levels. 



Reynolds' Mine, one and a half miles south of Wrightsdale; pro- 

 duction small. 



Wood's Mine, one mile southwest of Lee's Mill; 120,000 tons. 

 The Wood's Mine chromite deposit formed an enormous, irregular 

 mass, in a dark green serpentine, which assumes a brown coating on 

 weathering. The deposit was worked to a depth of 720 feet. The 

 greatest length along the strike was 300 feet, with a width of 10 

 to 35 feet, and a pitch of 40Â° to 60Â°. The strike was nearly E. and 

 W. at the outcrop, and N. and S. on the lower levels. Branches of 

 the chromite body occasionally extended into the serpentine. 7 



Adjacent to the chromite, the serpentine showed a prismatic 

 structure, the cracks of which extended normally to the chromite 

 for a distance of a half inch or more, and were filled with deweylite 

 or magnesite. This secondary phenomenon occurred during the 

 serpentinization of the peridotite or pyroxenite, and indicates that

the chromite deposit was formed prior to the serpentinization. A 

 similar structure is found in the serpentine adjacent to magnetite 

 veins in Brinton's Quarry, three miles south of West Chester, Chester 

 County, Penna. 



The following minerals were found associated with the chromite, 

 clinochlore, kammererite, uvarovite, brucite, hydromagnesite, 

 genthite, and zaratite. 



Red Pit, one-half mile northeast of Line Pit ; production unknown. 



Jenkin's Pit, three-eighths of a mile northeast of Red Pit; 1,000 

 tons. This mine has been abandoned for a number of years, and the 

 writer's observations were limited to the material on the dumps. 



In addition to massive chromite much disseminated chrome, 

 known as "birds-eye ore" was mined. The chromite deposits occurred 

 in dark brown, light to dark-greenish, or almost black serpentines, 

 which under the hand lens are seen to consist of greenish translucent 

 grains. Under the microscope the serpentine shows characteristic 

 mesh structure with residual grains of olivine (fig. 1). The dissem- 

 inated chromite occurs as rounded grains in a light greenish ser- 

 pentine, with residual olivine. Occasional grains of serpentinized 

 olivine are found entirely enclosed by chromite (fig. 2), and study 

 of thin sections indicates that the chromite crystallized out from 

 the magma contemporaneously with the olivine. 



The clinochlore and kammererite form druses in the chromite, 

 having been deposited by hydrothermal solutions, perhaps during 

 the process of serpentinization. The genthite and zaratite are due 

 to the weathering of minute amounts of an undetermined nickel sul- 

 fide present in the chromite. 



Carter's Mine, three-eighths of a mile east of Wood's Mine; 400 tons. 



Scott's Mine, two miles southwest of Nottingham; 3,000 tons. 



Moro Phillips' Mine, one mile south of Nottingham; 250 tons. 



In addition a number of smaller pits have produced from 20 to 

 50 tons, while more than 5,000 tons of sand chrome has been reported 

 to have been obtained by washing the stream sands of the region. 



An abandoned magnetite mine is situated one-and-a-quarter miles 

 northeast Rock Springs cross-roads, Maryland. 



The Serpentines. The serpentines forming the country rock are 

 largely brownish or greenish rocks, which are seen under the hand 

 lens to consist of small greenish, translucent grains, separated by 

 films of magnetite particles. Under the microscope some of the

grains exhibit mesh structure and contain residual olivine, indi- 

 cating that the parent rocks were largely peridotites of the type

saxonite, composed of olivine and enstatite. A pseudo-porphyritic 

 type is found consisting of a light grayish-green serpentine, with 

 small patches rich in magnetite, the particles of which are arranged 

 in definite patterns, indicating a possible derivation from a fer- 

 riferous pyroxene, probably hypersthene. 



The williamsite is a compact, green, translucent, jade-like ser- 

 pentine, which under the hand lens shows a fibrous structure. 

 Under polarized light the rock is seen to be composed of aggregates 

 of fibres polarizing in first order gray and yellow colors (fig. 3). 

 Rarely minute particles of a silver-white undetermined nickel 

 sulfide may be found in the williamsite. Mesh structure is absent 

 and no traces of the parent mineral from which the williamsite is 

 derived occurs. The writer considers the mineral to have been 

 derived from enstatite by hydrothermal metamorphism. 



Analyses of the williamsite are given below, showing it to be a 

 pure serpentine.

Chromite. The chromite forms granular black masses, and 

 contains some disseminated williamsite. In very thin sections the 

 mineral shows a reddish translucency, and evidence of fracturing 

 during the period of sarpentinization (fig. 4). 



Origin of the Line Pit deposit. It is at once apparent from the 

 form and position of the Line Pit deposit that it was formed later 

 than the surrounding rock. Unfortunately but little is known re- 

 garding the behavior of chromite in igneous melts, beyond the 

 fact that its occurrence is limited to the ultrabasic rocks and that it 

 begins to crystallize early, and the period of its crystallization 

 may overlap that of the enstatite. 



That the chromite deposit had been formed previous to the ser- 

 pentinization is indicated by the evident fracturing of the chromite 

 grains (fig. 4) which occurred during this process. 




It seems, therefore, that after most of the magma had crys- 

 tallized into the peridotite, and the pipe-like mass of liquid was in- 

 jected into the peridotite, where after further differentiation, the 

 material crystallized into enstatite and chromite. Hydrothermal 

 solutions later altered the enstatite to williamsite. 



The Line Pit, Red Pit, Jenkins' Mine and Reynolds' Mine deposits 

 all fall on a line on the map. The significance of this is not known.

A FOSSIL OWL FROM THE BRIDGER EOCENE. 

 BY ALEXANDER WETMORE. 



In 1873, Dr. Joseph Leidy described some fragments of bone, 

 supposed to be those of a large lizard from the Bridger deposits of 

 Wyoming as Saniwa major, basing this name on the distal end of a 

 humerus and two fragmentary vertebrae. The type specimens 

 preserved in the collections of the Academy of Natural Sciences of 

 Philadelphia were borrowed recently by Mr. C. W. Gilmore, who 

 had recognized that the type material was probably composite, and 

 to him and to Dr. Witmer Stone, I am indebted for permission to 

 study the humerus in question, which proves to be that of a bird. 



Though Dr. Leidy considered this humerus as lacertilian, and 

 compared it with that of a monitor, it is readily seen that it does 

 not belong in this group as there is no sign of an epiphysis on the 

 articular end of the bone. The specimen is well fossilized, and is 

 dark green in color save along the condyles, where it is lighter and 

 has a somewhat chalky appearance, a circumstance that perhaps 

 led to its allocation in the Sauria, as it may have been thought that 

 this lighter area was epiphysial in character. 



The two broken vertebrae mentioned must stand as the type of 

 Saniwa major Leidy and are hereby so designated. The avian hum- 

 erus, representing an owl of the family Bubonidae, may be known as 



Minerva saurodosis sp. nov. 



Characters. â€” Distal end of humerus (figs. 1 and 2) similar in 

 general form to Bubo virginianus (Gmelin) but smaller, with radial 

 and ulnar trochleae reduced in size; ulnar trochleae less produced 

 distally toward outer end; angle at base of ulnar condyle on inner 

 anterior face sloping gently (not abrupt) ; surface above entepicondy- 

 lar process broader, less elevated, sloping gradually into brachial 

 depression; entepicondylar process slighter, lateral margin of bone 

 above ectepicondylar process relatively less broadened, with more 

 rounded margins, expanding to support entepicondyle ; shaft ex- 

 panding somewhat to support ectepicondylar process. 



Description. â€” Type, Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia, no. 9131,

 Dry Creek," about ten miles from Fort Bridger, Wyoming; Eocene

(Bridger formation), collected by Dr. James Van A. Carter, between 

 1869 and 1872. 



A bird slightly larger than the Barred Owl, Strix varia Barton; 

 smaller than the Great Horned Owl, Bubo virginianus (Gmelin). 



Distal end of humerus much expanded as in other owls, the dia- 

 meter across the condyles nearly twice that of the shaft ; end of ecte- 

 picondylar process broken away, the shaft sloping out to support 

 base of process; lateral epicondyle produced, shelf-like, between 

 base of ectepicondylar process and radial trochlea, confluent in- 

 wardly with base of shaft, with outer margin below ectepicondylar 

 process raised so that the shelf appears excavated (concave), changing 

 outwardly to a shallow groove delimiting the external face of the 

 radial trochlea and disappearing as it comes to the summit of the 

 articular surface; radial trochlea short, roundly elevated, slightly 

 sigmoid in outline, bulging over shelf of lateral epicondyle, sharply 

 declivous on opposite side, at inner end forming a right angle with 

 shaft; ulnar trochlea relatively small, not abruptly elevated above 

 shaft on inner side (articular surface slightly weathered away so 

 that a slight angular tip was formerly present), slender toward outer 

 margin, so that rounded articular head is reduced; intertrochlear 

 groove narrow, with sharp slope toward radial side 

 and more gradual one opposite toward ulnar 

 trochlea; attachment for pronator brevis exten- 

 sive, roughly elliptical in outline, relatively more 

 extensive than in modern owls as it is nearly as 

 long as globular portion of ulnar trochlea; attach- 

 ments for pronator longus and flexor carpi ul- 

 naris roughly rounded, well impressed; outer face 

 of median epicondyle expanded on both margins, 

 appearing as a somewhat elliptical expansion at 

 lower end of shaft, slightly impressed on outer 

 face above base of entepicondylar process; depression 

 for brachialis inferior distinct but only slightly impres- 

 sed, more distinct toward ulnar margin; olecranal 

 depression fairly deep, abruptly delimited against 

 median epicondyle, with extent less sharply cut off 

 by expansion of ulnar trochlea, merging impercepti- 

 bly into shaft forward; sulcus anconei lateralis nar- 

 row, shallowly and regularly concave, disappearing 

 after leaving lateral epicondyle; sulcus anconei 

 medius broad, divided into two unequal parts by a 

 slightly raised line passing from upper margin of olecranal fossa ob- 

 liquely to margin of shaft at point where the lateral epicondyle ta- 

 pers gradually into straight shaft; bone hollow. 



Measurements (in millimeters). â€” Lateral breadth of shaft above 

 depression for brachialis inferior 8.5; breadth across distal end 18.7;

extreme length of radial trochlea 7.8; greatest length of attach- 

 ment for pronator brevis 6. 



Range. â€” From Bridger formation, Eocene, near Fort Bridger, 

 Wyoming. 



Remarks. â€” The broken humerus described above, here exhumed 

 from a resting place among its cold-blooded relatives, the lizards, 

 represents an owl smaller than Bubo virginianus, similar in size to 

 Pulsatrix perspicillata (Latham), that does not resemble closely any- 

 existing genus of modern North American owls but in a way combines 

 characters pertaining to several. Minerva saurodosis was apparently 

 a bird of moderate flight, as processes for muscle attachment, while 

 strong, are not rugged as they are in the Great Horned and Snowy 

 Owls that perform extended migrations. In general outline the 

 humerus of M. saurodosis suggests that of Bubo but with the 

 processes and tubercles developed even to a less degree than in the 

 Barred Owl, Spotted Owl, or Pulsatrix perspicillata. It is judged 

 that it may have been a resident species. 



The generic allocation of this ancient owl is more or less tentative. 

 In 1913, Dr. R. W. Shufeldt 1 described as Aquila antiquq the hind 

 claw of a bird collected August 4, 1905, by W. J. Sinclair in the 

 Bridger formation at Church Buttes, Wyoming. Later 2 , Dr. 

 Shufeldt, after study of further material, decided that this species 

 should be relegated to the owls and set up the genus Minerva to 

 receive it. The species, of a size much larger than any exist- 

 ing North American Owls, was characterized by the great pro- 

 longation of the dorsal articular surface of the hind claw. This 

 upper angle projects until the articular facet forms almost half of a 

 circle. This character, while more pronounced in owls than in other 

 groups that I have examined (much more than in available Accip- 

 itriformes) reaches a development in Minerva far beyond that of any 

 modern owl that I have seen. To allow flexibility in movement it 

 must have been received in a deeper pit than ordinary on the distal 

 end of the digital phalanx. Otherwise the hind claw would have had 

 little power of backward flexion. A structure similar to this type 

 of articular facet would be formed by ankylosis of the sesamoid 

 found at the upper end of the claw articulation in many lizards, 

 with the end of the bone.

2 Trans. Connecticut Acad. Arts Sci., Vol. 19, Feb., 1915, p. 43. 




As Minerva antiqua represents a specialized type of owl from the 

 Bridger formation it seems more logical at present to describe the 

 present species, also a peculiar form from the same deposits, in the 

 genus Minerva than to erect for it a new genus. With further ma- 

 terial the two may be found widely and trenchantly separated. 

 For the present, Minerva saurodosis is to be distinguished from M . 

 antiqua by its much smaller size. Strangely enough M. saurodosis 

 as represented by this broken humerus has little resemblance to 

 Tyto, a possible indication of the archaic origin of the Barn Owl, 

 while to go farther afield it shows little to suggest any of the Goat- 

 suckers or the Oil-bird (Steatornis) . In other than generalized group 

 resemblances there is in fact slight connection evident between it 

 and any of the other Coraciiform suborders. There are certain 

 resemblances to the Anisodactylae (Kingfishers, Todies, Motmots, 

 etc.), as well as to the superfamily Galbuloidae of the Picariae, 

 containing the Jacamars and Puff-birds, but these similarities are 

 not close.

SCROPHULARIACEAE OF THE WEST GULF STATES. 



By Francis W. Pennell. 



This study deals with the plants of the family Scrophulariaceae 

 occurring in the area west of the Mississippi and east of the Pecos 

 rivers, in the states of Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Texas. 

 It follows closely the manner of presentation of the account of the 

 "Scrophulariaceae of the Southeastern United States," which 

 appeared in these Proceedings 1 in 1920, and the introduction to that 

 paper will in most points apply to this. 



To the West Gulf states I have made two collecting-trips, one 

 in spring and one in early autumn. The latter, the first in point 

 of time, was in 1913 through central Oklahoma, central and south- 

 eastern Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, and was in search of the 

 plants herein classed in the tribe Buchnereae. Nearly every species 

 of these genera was found and descriptions were made of the form 

 and color of corolla and other evanescent features. This study 

 was undertaken on behalf of the University of Pennsylvania and 

 its results still await publication in the "Contributions from the 

 Botanical Laboratory" of that institution. Unexpectedly there- 

 fore, a number of new species and geographic varieties will first ap- 

 pear on these pages. 



In late April and May of 1920 I visited all of these states for 

 early-flowering species, obtaining in chief variety species of the 

 genera Penstemon and Castilleja. This second journey, made in the 

 interests of the New York Botanical Garden, took me across 

 southern Louisiana and Texas to Corpus Christi, inland through 

 central Texas and up to the Staked Plains of the northwest, across 

 Oklahoma from west to east, and across the Ozark Mountains 

 and into the pineland of eastern Arkansas. Neither route need 

 now be cited in detail, as all localities are given in the lists which, 

 classified by counties, accompany each species. Suffice it to say 

 for both trips, the field-descriptions obtained, and the observa- 

 tions of the limits of variation of each species, have been beyond

value. In this manner, group by group, should all our vast body 

 of herbarium-conclusions be checked and re-valued in the field! 



The tribe least studied in this area is the Gratioleae. These 

 are summer-blooming and unfortunately were not included among 

 the special objects of search of my first journey. However, only 

 in Gratiola do I feel this loss, and it remains for some future worker 

 to give us needed information of G. gracilis and G. fiava. Most 

 of the tribe but slightly enter the area from the East Gulf states 

 and are species well-known eastward. Of other tribes, I par- 

 ticularly deplore not finding in blossom Leucophyllum, said to be 

 one of the finest ornamental shrubs of Texas. Species of still 

 other tribes were missed, but, while it would have been a pleasure 

 to have seen what must be among the most showy members of their 

 respective genera, Penstemon murrayanus and Castilleja pur- 

 purea, j r et such distinct species are not in need of close analysis. 



When the attempt is made to express in terms of natural areas 

 of distribution the ranges of various species over an area such as 

 this, one realizes how far ahead is still any comprehensive out- 

 lining of phytogeographic areas in our country. However, I have 

 tried to use terms that have some definiteness, physiographic or 

 geologic. In Louisiana and eastern Texas we have some prelimin- 

 ary sketches by Roland M. Harper 2 , in Texas the outlines of 

 Vernon Bailey 3 , W. L. Bray 4 , and R. T. Hill 5 , and in both Texas 

 and Oklahoma excellent geological maps. In each state careful 

 state surveys of plant and animal distribution are needed, and 

 such tasks should call forth local enthusiasm. Mr. Bailey's study 

 is the most accurate of those seen, and applies carefully the 

 system of life-zones evolved by the Biological Survey. Al- 

 though I am an ardent devotee of this system when applied in 

 mountainous regions, I can but wonder what value a life-zone 

 outline can be in such a land as Texas. Life-zones lay stress upon 

 the one factor of temperature; in the Rockies and Andes the limits 

 of bands of temperature-controlled vegetation are distinct enough, 

 but surely across flat and rolling Texas the student of distribution 

 must pay more attention to moisture and soil. However, for

species of upland Texas, following Bailey's map, I have given 

 life-zone â€” but only to make as definite as possible my statement 

 of range. Usually I have been content with other terms. Nearly 

 everywhere through the West Gulf states, I have found collections 

 so few and remote as to make any statement of range only a skeleton 

 outline and a study of probabilities. 



We have quite insufficient collections from the West Gulf states. 

 Yet that there are many who have had some interest in this flora 

 the list of collectors at the close of this article testifies. To all 

 these collectors I feel my indebtedness; as also I am under obliga- 

 tions to the curators of the several herbaria, also listed herewith, 

 who have placed at my disposal the material in their care. The 

 Missouri Botanical Garden has undertaken a special investi- 

 gation of the plant-life of the West Gulf states, and Mr. Ernest J. 

 Palmer's work is giving us our best understanding of their flora. 



In the present outline, as in the study of southeastern Scrophula- 

 riaceae, are given full keys to contrasts noted, but these made to 

 apply only to species of the area considered. A further modifi- 

 cation of the phylogeny of this family, one which was introduced 

 in my study of the " Scrophulariaceae of Colombia," is to consider 

 Mimulus as a tribe apart from the Gratioleae. Synonomy is now 

 given, and the application of each name explained; again this 

 data is only given as it pertains to native species or to species 

 proposed from this area. Available typic and isotypic material 

 has been studied, and the Academy's herbarium has proven rich 

 in the types of Nuttall's and of Leavenworth's Arkansas species. 



To show the basis for the summaries of distribution, and to enable 

 others from other view-points to work with this data, I am citing for 

 native species all localities from which specimens have been seen. 

 These are listed by states, and alphabetically by counties, the name 

 of the county being followed by a colon. One collection to a county 

 is cited. The letters in parentheses following the collection-entry 

 refer to the herbarium in which the specimen may be consulted, 

 and their application may be found from the list of herbaria given 

 at the end of this paper.

There can be no doubt of the identity of the Louisiana aquatic 

 with this species of Brazil. The exceedingly small flowers of this 

 genus and the occurrence of the plants in river-sloughs, cause them 

 to be little observed, and the species may be widely distributed 

 through Tropical America. H. egense has likely been brought to

Plants very variable, apparently tending to two types, which are 




1921] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA 489 



predominantly plants of open or of shade. Both however, 

 are frequently intermixed. One- has corolla white or pale-pink, 

 with relatively wider throat, the pedicels and peduncles shorter so 

 that the thyrsus is more congested, and the leaves broader; this, 

 the prevalent form, is the plant called by Heller P. cobaea and by 

 Small P. helleri. The other has corolla darker, frequently bright 

 pink-red, with narrower throat more glandular within, the ped- 

 uncles and often fewer pedicels longer so that the thyrsus is more 

 lax, arid the leaves frequently narrower; this would be typical P. 

 triflorus. In both the corolla has conspicuous deeper pink lines, 

 especially on the anterior side. However, field-study convinces 

 me that no real distinction of these trends can be made. All are 

 well shown in my series from Kerrville, Texas. Flowering from 

 March to May. 



Thin calcareous loam, gravelly or rocky places, common on the 

 hills of the Edwards Plateau, less frequent in the Lampasas and

 ecaries' Garden at Chelsea, to whom it was sent by Mr. Hogg." A 

 careful description and illustration certainly of the plant now considered, 

 the description being apparently more accurate than Nuttall's own, or 

 that of Sims, in mentioning the pubescence of the anthers. 



Corolla, westward, white or externally slightly purplish; east- 

 ward the corolla tends to be smaller, more purplish-tinged and with 

 fine violet lines within throat. Flowering from mid- April to early 

 June, depending upon latitude. 



Loam or sandy soil, open woodlands, meadows and prairies;

16. Penstemon pauciflorus Buckley. 



Penstemon pauciflorus Buckley, in Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila. 1861 : 461. 

 1862. "Past [=Post] oak woods south of Fort Belknap, [Texas, S. B. 

 Buckley, May, 1860-61]." Fort Belknap was in Young County on the 

 Brazos. The description inapplicable to any Penstemon, and at variance 

 with the plant to which the name is now applied in these points: segments 

 linear r subulate, corolla-tube constricted to scarcely a line in width and 

 sterile filament glabrous with cilated apex. Fortunately, Dr. A. Gray had 

 seen Buckley's material in the two collections to which he sent specimens, 

 the herbarium of the Philadelphia Academy, and that of Elias Durand. 

 In his criticism of Buckley's proposed species [in Proc. Acad. Sci. Phila. 

 1862: 165. 1863] he tells us that Buckley confused, with a genuine Pen- 

 stemon, Phlox pilosa L., and that most of the description applies to the lat- 

 ter! Also that the Penstemon, "a slender form of P. pubescens," has a 

 sterile filament "heavily bearded," a feature particularly true of the pres- 

 ent species. The specific name should certainly apply to the Penstemon 

 component. As there appears to be but one species of this genus charac- 

 teristic of post-oak woods in Texas, and that one has these features, 

 the Penstemon element of Buckley could scarcely fail to have been the 



Slant now considered. As no Penstemon was supplied to the Academy 

 erbarium the type must be the plant of the Durand Herbarium, but 

 either this admixture was culled out by Durand from his material, which 

 is now in the Herbarium of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Phila- 

 delpha, or else it is included in the portion of his herbarium which went 

 to Paris. Accordingly it seems best to redescribe the species. 



Stems scarcely clustered, frequently but one from a root, slender, 

 3-7 dm. tall, minutely pubescent over entire surface, green or purp- 

 lish. Leaves membranous, green, slightly paler beneath, finely 

 pubescent to nearly glabrous; the lowest narrowed to petiole-like 

 bases, the longest ovate to oblong, 3-10 cm. long, obtuse, crenate- 




496 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [PART III 



serrate, the upper lanceolate or oblong-lanceolate, obtuse or obtus- 

 ish, serrate; the bracts much reduced. Thyrsus about one third 

 the height of the plant, longer than wide, of 3-6 fascicles, each of 

 two axillary branches, which cymosely branch 2-3 times, rarely 

 more, the pedicels shorter than the primary peduncle. Sepals 

 in anthesis 2-6 mm. long, in fruit 3-7 mm. long, oblong-ovate to 

 ovate, acute to acuminate, slightly or not scarious margined, gland- 

 ular-pubescent. Corolla 20-28 mm.. long; the tube and throat 15- 

 20 mm. long, the throat narrow, slightly inflated, strongly two- 

 ridged within on anterior side, the orifice nearly closed by the up- 

 curved base of the anterior lip; the two posterior lobes 3-5 mm. long, 

 united and arched less than or about one half length, their free 

 portions spreading; the three anterior lobes 5-8 mm. long, united 

 at base; the corolla externally finely glandular-pubescent, internally 

 slightly pubescent over the base of the anterior lobes; whitish or 

 purplish-white, on anterior side with fine violet lines. Anther-cells 

 divaricate, oblong, violet, 8. mm. long, microscopically puberulent, 

 opening throughout. Sterile filament slightly exserted, flat, not 

 wider distally, densely bearded with deep-yellow, becoming brown- 

 ish-yellow hairs. Capsule 8-10 mm. long, ovate-acuminate in out- 

 line, glabrous, brown. Seeds .8-1 mm long, sharply and slightly 

 wing-angled; testa brown lustrous, reticulate. 



Plants of coastal plain, especially in pineland and coast prairie, 

 smaller-leaved and with stem nearly bare, while upland plants are 

 rather leafy. Also upland plants, especially in eastern Oklahoma, 

 are relatively more pubescent. 



Sandy soil, usually open woodland or prairie, through the Coastal 

 Plain south of the Arkansas River in Arkansas and west to the 

 Guadalupe River in Texas, in long-leaf pineland, short-leaf pine- 

 land, coastal prairie and post-oak woods; inland in sandy or rocky 

 woods or prairies to the Burnet metamorphic country of central 

 Texas, and northwestward (west of the higher Ouachita Hills) 

 to central Oklahoma. Flowering from early April to early June, 

 depending upon latitude.

 leaves in this species can scarcely be called hastate. The carefully 

 described flower however would appear to be of this genus, although no 

 mention is made of the rudimentary fifth stamen, nor is the corolla ever 

 pubescent within (veloutee).

 is considered true S. marilandica only in the presence of pubescence on 

 the lower surface of the leaves, a condition found in the northern and 

 predominating in the western part of the range of the species. Eastward 

 this sporadic and fluctuating state can be only considered as a forma, 

 neglecta (Rydb.) Pennell, comb, nov; the two should be studied.

Linaria texana Scheele, in Linnaea 21: 4761. 1848. "Zwischen Houston 

 and Austin [Texas] haufig: "Romer." Description sufficiently distinctive. 



Here distinguished primarily by roughness of seeds, which how- 

 ever varies from a few roughenings on the side to densely tuber- 

 culate. The wealth of Texan material at my disposal shows that 

 each character of the contrasts previously outlined (in Contrib. 

 U. S. Nat. Herb. 20: 323. 1920, and Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila. 

 71: 258. 1920) between this and Linaria canadensis breaks down 

 in numerous instances through the area where the two overlap. 

 Consequently it seems more rational to consider texana a variety, 

 its range and relation to the species roughly paralleling that of 

 Veronica peregrina xalapensis (H. B. K.) Pennell. For an ex- 

 cellent illustration of Linaria canadensis texana see the Botanical 

 Magazine 63: pi. 3473. 1836.

1. Castillo ja sessiliflora Pursh. 



Castilleja sessiliflora Pursh, Fl. Am. Sept. 738. 1814. "In upper Louisiana. 



Bradbury v.s. in Herb. Bradbury." Imperfectly described. Better

 flora, Gen. N. Am. PI. 2: 55. 1818. 



Corolla yellowish-green, the posterior lip pink-margined, the 

 anterior yellowish-white and only slightly greenish-thickened at 

 base. Bracts and calyx distinctly yellowish. Flowering in May 

 and June. 



Sandy or rocky plains and bluffs, escarpments of the Staked 

 Plains of northwestern Texas; Upper Sonoran Zone (at altitudes 

 above 1500 meters). Through the Great Plains from Illinois and 

 Manitoba to Wyoming and northwestern Texas.

2. Castilleja labiata Pennell, sp. nov. 



Root perennial. Stems several, 1.5 â€” 2 dm. tall, arachnoid-lanate 

 with close pubescence. Leaves 3-7 cm. long, linear to lanceolate, 

 slightly 3-ribbed, trifid, with narrow lobes, finely cinereous-pubescent 

 especially on the lower surface, green above, paler beneath. Bracts 

 broader, conspicuously trifid, probably distally yellowish or gresn- 

 ish-yellow. Sepals 22-25 mm. long, those of each side united \ 

 length, acutish to acuminate, puberulent, apparently yellowish. Co- 

 rolla 35-40 mm. long; posterior lip 10-12 mm. long, with thin mar- 

 gins; anterior 5-7 mm. long, proximally deep-green, distally flaring, 

 evidently yellow or yellowish; anterior lobes glandular-pubescent, 

 posterior with longer glandless hairs. Stigma about 1 mm. wide. 

 Capsule not seen. 



Type, stony prairie (uncommon), San Angelo, Texas, collected 

 in flower May 19, 1899, W. L. Bray 353, in United States National 

 Herbarium; isotype in Herb. University of Texas. 



I regret that the spring of 1920 had been so dry, and consequently 

 so early, that on my visit to San Angelo on May 18 and 19, all 

 Castillejas were in fruit and shriveled. I failed to find this species, 

 but the plant I did find and which appeared to be common proved 

 to be C. citrina, below. Though disliking to base a species of this 

 critical genus on so few collections, I think C. labiata must be 

 recognized. It appears to be a primitive member of the alliance of 

 C. purpurea (Nutt.) G. Don, connecting that group with C. sessili- 

 flora Pursh.
