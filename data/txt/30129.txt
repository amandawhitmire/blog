1906.1 NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



PLANARIA MOEGANI n. sp 



BY N. M. STEVENS AND A. M. BORING. 



Size. — Length 10-12 mm., width in the region of the pharynx 1.6 

 mm., at the level of the eyes 1 mm. 



Form. — Head wedge-shaped, no auricular appendages, posterior 

 end obtuse, thickness slight compared with Planaria maculata or P. 

 simplicissima (Plate I, figs. 1 and 2). 



Color. — ^White and translucent; digestive tract often colored green, 

 yellow, brown, or red by food recently ingested. 



Eyes. — ^Two, crescent-shaped, situated far back and near together 

 (PI. I, figs. 1-4). 



Nervous Systejn. — Cephalic ganglia large and distinct, connected by 

 a broad commissure, lateral nerve cords as in P. maculata, two promi- 

 nent nerves extending forward from below the eyes (Plate I, fig. 4). 



Pharynx. — Single, much elongated, centrally located in forms with 

 functional sexual organs, posterior to the center in forms which are 

 reproducing asexually (Plate I, figs. 1 and 2). Digestive tract as in 

 the typical triclads with little anastomosis of branches (fig. 3). 



Reproductive Organs. — Ovaries two, situated ventrall}^ between the 

 anterior axial division of the gut and its first lateral branches, some- 

 times lobed, and often extending nearly to the dorsal epidermis 

 (Plate I, fig. 4). Oviducts following a spiral course dorsal and slightly 

 lateral to the nerve cords, back to the region of the atrial organs, 

 where they converge and unite into a short common oviduct which 

 enters the atrium dorsal to the opening of the uterus stalk, instead of 

 entering a vagina as in P. maculata (Cm-tis, '02). Spermatozoa are 

 often found massed at the anterior end of the oviducts. Yolk glands 

 lie between all of the main branches of the gut dorsal to the testes. 

 Testes many, irregular in form and variable in size, scattered between 

 the branches of the gut, for the most part ventral and median to the 

 nerve cords, and extending from the region of the ovaries to the 

 posterior end of the pharynx (fewer and larger than in P. maculata). 

 Distinct seminal vesicles extending posteriorly from the last pair of 

 testes (y.s., Plate I, figs. 5 and 6). Vasa deferentia broad, short and 




8 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



only slightly coiled, entering the anterior enlargement of the lumen of 

 the penis nearly at right angles. Penis short and broad, nearly filling 

 the atrium (similar to that of P. maculata). Uterus large, dorsal, ex- 

 tending forward nearly to the pharynx chamber; stalk of the uterus 

 passing to the left side, dorsal to the vasa deferentia and oviducts, 

 and entering the atrium laterally and ventral to the entrance of the 

 common oviduct (Plate I, figs. 5 and 6). 



Reproduction by Fission. — Like Planaria maculata, this species 

 reproduces both sexually and asexually. Indications that fission had 

 occurred were observed in May, 1901-1905. In May, 1905, while all 

 the individuals in one branch of a certain stream were sexually mature 

 and depositing egg-capsules, those in another branch of the same 

 stream were found in all stages of fission and regeneration (Plate I, 

 figs. 7-10). During the last week of May and first week of June a few 

 individuals showed regenerating atrial organs. The same difference, 

 as to sexual matiu-ity and fission, was observed in collections from the 

 two branches of the stream in October, and at the date of writing 

 (February 7th) there are no sexually mature worms among the thirty 

 to forty specimens which were reproducing by fission when brought 

 into the laboratory in October. About half of the number have 

 divided in the aquarium. Fission occurs at a point nearer the pharynx 

 than in P. maculata (fig. 7), 



Regeneration. — Both anterior and posterior regeneration at all levels 

 proceeds much as in P. simplicissima, but both regeneration and form 

 regulation are more rapid. 



Habitat. — Planaria morgani is found on the under side of stones and 

 dead leaves in a small stream, one branch of which flows through the 

 Bryn Mawr College campus. The authors have not found it elsewhere.

STUDIES IN SOUTH AND CENTEAL AMERICAN ACRIDINiE (ORTHOPTERA), 

 WITH THE DESCRIPTIONS OF A NEW GENUS AND SIX NEW SPECIES. 



BY JAMES A. G. REHN. 



The subfamily treated in the following pages is usually termed the 

 Truxalinse, but the resurrection of the Old World Linnsean genus 

 Acrida necessitates the use of the name Acridinae. 



Of this subfamily by far the majority of the South and Central 

 American genera have been studied in this connection and numerous 

 opinions and conclusions regarding their relationship are given in the 

 following pages, while several genera, or subgenera, have been con- 

 sidered untenable and one new one proposed. The consideration of 

 several wrongly identified or overlooked species caused a shifting of 

 generic names, which necessitated in one case a new generic name. 



Twenty-two genera have been considered in more or less detail, and 

 sixty-three species, of which six are new, have been examined. The 

 material examined numbered six hundred and twenty specimens, of 

 which two hundred and sixty-seven were from the Academy Collection, 

 three hundred and twenty-eight from the Hebard Collection, and 

 twenty-five from various sources. 



I wish to express my thanks to Mr. Hebard for the privilege of 

 examining the material from his collection. 



HYALOPTERYGES. 

 HYALOPTERYX Charpentier. 

 1845. Hyalopieryx Charpentier, Orthopt. Descr. et Depict., tab. 46. 

 Type. — H. rufipennis Charpentier. 



From its closest allies Hyalopteryx can be separated as follows: 

 from Radinotatum by the presence of well developed tegmina and wings, 

 the caudal expansion of the pronotum and the much shorter rostrum 

 and less produced head; from Achurum by the more robust form, 

 the caudal expansion of the pronotum (more or less pronounced ac- 

 cording to the sex), the much broader tegmina and wings as well as the 

 shorter, blunter rostrum and less produced head ; from Eutryxalis in 

 the longer, slender limbs, the somewhat broader tegmina, the shorter 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 11 



rostrum, and the more fenestrate wings of the male ; from Truxalis in 

 the longer, more produced rostrum, the more angulate caudal 

 margin of the pronotum, the slender caudal limbs and the broader, 

 less subequal tegmina; from Orphula in the characters which 

 separate it from Truxalis. The genus Hyalopteryx appears to con- 

 nect two extremes of the series, one extreme represented by Radi- 

 notatum, a quite peculiar type, and Achurum, and the other by Truxalis 

 and Orphula, Eutryxalis apparently sharing the intermediate position, 

 but really being closer to Truxalis. The sequence of genera which 

 appears most natural in the Hyalopteryges is-

Hyalopteryx rufipennis Charpentier.

 tab. 46. [Brazil.] 



Sapucay, Paraguay. December 13, 16, 19, 1904. March 7, 1902. 

 February 13 and 15, March 6, 7 and 9, 1905. (Foster, Hebard Coll.) 

 Eleven d'd', eleven 9 9. 



These specimens appear from Charpentier's description and figure 

 to be the same form as he called rufipennis. The description particu- 

 larly mentions the distinct lines on the metazona, and states that the 

 lateral carinse are similar to the median, which would hardly have 

 been said if the metazona was irregularly lineato-rugose and the lateral 

 carinse faint and strongly expanded on the metazona, as in the new 

 species here described as H. asinus. Of the caudal femora he says: 

 "Die Hinterschenkel .... oben eine fein erhabene Linie, die vorn 

 am Knie in eine ganz kleine Spitze ausgeht, woselbst seitwiirts zwey 

 weit grossere hervorragen, wie Stacheln." From this and the com- 

 parative proportions of the structures mentioned above and the sub- 

 genital plate as figured in his plate it is very evident that the Sapucay 

 specimens are either Charpentier's rufipennis or a very closely related 

 new species. Burr's H. exaggerata,^ the only other previously de- 

 scribed species, possesses elongated genicular structures as in my new 

 asinus. 



The series examined is quite uniform, a little variation in size being 



* Trans. Ent. Soc. London, 1902, pt. II, p. 183. [Chiquitos, Bolivia.]

noticed and a little in the intensity of fine blackish maculations on 

 the dorsum, a few specimens being almost free from the latter while 

 others have a '^salt and pepper" effect.

Allied to H. rufipennis Charpentier, but differing in the larger size 

 and slenderer limbs in both sexes, and in the male in the bullate meta- 

 zona, the broader, more acute tegmina, the elongate internal genic- 

 ular processes of the caudal femora and the extremely elongate sub- 

 genital plate. The Bolivian H. exaggerata Burr is a close ally as

shown by the genicular structures mentioned in the brief original 

 description, but it can be separated by the yellow anal field of the 

 wings and by inference by other characters, as the author says : " In 

 venation and structure, this form resembles H. rufipennis. ' ' 



Size rather large ; form elongate, very distinctly compressed, greatly so 

 in the male ; surface rugulose and covered with scattered whitish hairs, 

 both the character of the surface and the hairs being much more pro- 

 nounced in the male than the female. Head about equal to the pro- 

 notum in length in the male, distinctly shorter in the female, the 

 occiput much more ascendent in the male than in the female ; f astigium 

 projecting beyond the eyes a distance equal to the width at the cephalic 

 margin of the eyes, lateral margins parallel in the male, slightly con- 

 verging in the female, the apex with a rounded angle, lateral sections 

 more distinctly depressed and the short medial carina more apparent 

 in the female than in the male; face very strongly retreating in the 

 male, slightly less in the female; frontal costa narrow, moderately

These specimens are quite uniform in size, and in color have the 

 browns and greens distributed in the bicolored individuals as seen in 

 Truxalis. No uniform brown specimen has been examined. 



The possession of two males and three females of this species from 

 Carcarafia, Argentina, received from Prof. Bruner and labelled Eutryxa- 

 lis minor Giglio-Tos, enabled the author to clear up a rather unfortunate 

 and complicated question of misidentification. A male and female

specimen of Metaleptea minor Giglio-Tos, received through Dr. Borelli 

 (the collector of the types) from the Turin Museum, show that the 

 species really is an Orphula and not closely related to Truxalis {Meta- 

 leptea Bruner), while the specimens determined by Bruner really 

 are Hyalopteryx gracilis, answering the description very well. The 

 species is quite distinct from Hyalopteryx and well worthy of generic 

 separation. 



From the known records this species appears to be distributed over 

 a large area, extending from Caiza in the Bolivian Chaco to the Rio 

 Colorado, and east to the Paraguay river region.

Records for this species include Buenos Ayres and San Lorenzo, 

 Argentina, Villa Rica and Asuncion, Paraguay, and Caiza, Bolivia, 

 as well as numerous localities north of Brazil. Bruner says it is " found 

 throughout the Republic [Argentine] north of the Rio Colorado, 

 especially along the eastern border."-

The specimens from Corumba are slightly larger than individuals 

 of the same sex from the other localities. Considerable variation 

 also exists in the form of the fastigium, the 9 from Chapada having 

 it rather broad, but otherwise inseparable, while one individual from 

 Sapucay has the same portion more acute than usual, in a considerable 

 measure approaching 0. minor. The tips of the tegmina are sharper 

 and more acute in individuals from Chapada, Corumba and Sao Paulo 

 than in Asuncion specimens, but the series from Sapucay includes 

 practically both extremes. Some specimens have the dorsal dark 

 lines absent and the coloration but little varied. 



The species has previously been recorded from Santos, Brazil, 

 Formosa and Resistencia nel Chaco, Argentina.

These authentic specimens, received from the Turin Museum, show 

 that the species is a member of the genus Orphula and closely related 

 to 0. pagana. From the latter species it differs in the slenderer head, 

 with less prominent and somewhat longer eyes, and the more acute 

 fastigium. 



MERMIRI^. 

 SYRBULA Stai. 



The genus Syrhula presents two extreme types, one represented by 

 admirahilis, and the other by montezuma and eslavoe. These extremes 

 might with justice be separated, as has provisionally been done by 

 the author (i.e., subgenus Hems), but for the presence of a type like 

 S. acuticornis, which is clearly an annectant form. 

 Syrbula montezuma (Saussure). 



The specimens from Cuernavaca, ^Mexico, previously recorded by 

 the author as *S. valida and eslavoe, and from La Joya, San Luis Potosi, 

 Mexico, are referable to this species, which is closely related to S. 

 eslavoe and differs chiefly in the less constricted lateral carinae of the 

 pronotum. 



* Bolivar's Orphula jucunda {Adas Soc. Espan. Hist Nat., XXV, p. 15) from 

 the Rio Atalapo is probably a member of this genus, but apparently quite dis- 

 tinct from either 0. pagana, with which it was originally compared, or 0. minor.

 Hebard Coll.) 



These specimens are assigned here with some little doubt, as they 

 are larger than Stal's measvirement of the female type (length 25 

 millimeters). 



The females all show more or less blacki.sh-brown maculations on the 

 tegmina, and the males have the caudal femora strongly rose-colored 

 with the genicular regions blackish. In the latter respect they appear 

 to approach the very brief characterization of australis, but the an- 

 tennae are longer and the general coloration rather different. The 

 latter character is of very uncertain value in this genus, as the extremes 

 of one species are qviite different, considering A. occidentalis a repre- 

 sentative form.

As the original description of this species is extremely brief, little 

 can be gleaned from it to aid in identifying material. In the material 

 examined the tegmen are darker near the costal margin than elsewhere, 

 and a median dark line is present on the head and pronotum of the 

 female and the pronotum of one male. The genicular regions are 

 obscured with dark color in both sexes, but more strongly in the male 

 than in the female. 



The range of the species is here extended north of its previous limit,

The coloration of these two specimens is generally similar, but one 

 has a longitudinal pale green bar on the proximal portion of each teg- 

 men. This specimen also has a median line on the head and pronotum 

 quite dark, while the other individual is devoid of any striking markings.

The material previously recorded by the author as A. mysteca from 

 Cuernavaca, Texolo, Uruapan and Patzcuaro, Mexico, has been re- 

 examined, and in all cases represents mysteca as understood by Bruner. 



The genus Sinipta Stal is a rather aberrant member of this group, 

 chiefly differing in the depressed, subensiform antennoe, which, how- 

 ever, does not appear to be sufficient to remove it from association 

 with Amblytropidia, some species of which have the antennae some- 

 what depressed. 



ORPHULELL^. 



The genera generally accredited to this group are with two excep- 

 tions, Calephorus and Comacris, American. The genera examined by 

 the author in this connection are given below, with their apparent 

 positions as far as can be expressed in a linear arrangement.

Orphulella Giglio-Tos.

Toxopterus Bolivar. 




20 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



Of these ten genera a total of* thirty-six species has been examined. 



Several genera like Chloealtis and Toxopterus are rather aberrant 

 and really occupy isolated positions, that of Chloealtis, however, being 

 somewhat modified by Cocytotettix, which is in a way a transition 

 type. The European Calephorus is also somewhat removed from the 

 nearest ally Parorphula, but its position appears to be in this group 

 and its affinity is clearly with the above-mentioned genus. The rela- 

 tionship of Sisantum and Orphulina is close, as an examination of the 

 type species of each shows, but, for the present at least, I have con- 

 sidered them distinct. The only American genus not examined is 

 (Eonomus Scudder, from California. 



CALEPHORUS Fieber. 



1853. Calephorus Fieber, Lotos, III, p. 97. May, 1853. Included C.

 pressicornis LatreiUe. 



1854. Oxycoryphus Fischer, Orthoptera Europisea, p. 311. Type, Acry- 

 dium compressicornis Latreille. 



This genus is mentioned merely to show its relationship to Paror- 

 phula from which it appears to be an offshoot. Aside from the pres- 

 ence of a distinct intercalary vein no character of great weight is ap- 

 parent to distinguish Calephorus from Parorphula. Three females of 

 C. compressicornis from France and Egypt have been examined. 



PARORPHULA Bruner.

 Included P. graminea, pallidinota and strigata Bruner, of which the

This genus appears to form a transition type between Calephorus and 

 the Sisantum-Orphulina group.

The genus Sisantum is closely related to Orphulina, and the two form 

 a group intermediate between the Calephorus-Parorphula type and 

 Orphulella.

 given by Giglio-Tos. The structure of the frontal costa is c[uite dis- 

 tinctive, at least in several species.

1905. Orphulella balloui Rehn, Ent. News. XVI, p. 178, pi. VIII, figs. 2 

 and 3. [Bay Estate, Barbados, West Indies.] 



This species is really a member of the genus Orphulina and rather 

 closely related to 0. pulchella. It can be separated by the blunter 

 fastigium, which has both the dorsal and lateral aspects showing a 

 more rounded angle, the slightly more elongate ovoid eye, the slightly 

 less longitudinal and more quadrate interspace between the meso- 

 sternal lobes, and the different coloration. The National Museum 

 Collection contains a single female, labelled "West Indies," collected 

 by the U. S. Fish Commission.

Allied to both pulchella and balloui, but separated from the former 

 by the more robust form, the less compressed eyes, the slightly less 

 pronounced expansion of the lateral carinse on the metazona and the 

 slightly more acute fastigium. The male has the interspaces between 

 the sternal lobes much as in Orphulella. From 0. balloui it can be 

 separated by the smaller size, more acute fastigium, the more promi- 

 nent eyes and the heavier caudal femora. This species is not closely 

 related to 0. acuta. 



Size small ; form moderately robust. Head slightly shorter than the

 antennae slightly longer than ( cJ* ) or subequal to ( ? ) 

 the head and pronotum together, moderately de- 

 pressed, slightly expanded proximad and very faintly 

 subensiform. Pronotum with the caudal width con- 

 tained about once and a half in the -length; cephalic 

 margin arcuato-truncate, caudal margin rounded 

 obtuse-angulate ; median carina distinct, lateral cari- 

 nas slightly narrowed at the second sulcus and moder- 

 ately divergent caudad in the male, subparallel to the second sulcus and 

 very slightly divergent caudad in the female; first transverse sulcus not 

 intersecting any of the carina, second intersecting the lateral, and the 

 third intersecting the lateral and median carinae, metazona slightly 

 longer than the prozona in the male, subequal in the female; lateral lobes 

 very distinctly longer than the depth, ventral margin with a considerable 

 oblique cephalic emargination. Interspace between the mesosternal 

 lobes slightly transverse in the male, and slightly longitudinal in the

 the male. Abdomen moderately compressed ; subgenital plate of male 

 blunt. Caudal femora moderately robust, considerabh' dilated in the 

 proximal two-thirds, pagina rather deeply sculptvu-ed; caudal tibiae

 eyes walnut brown; ventral siu-face buffy becoming buff-yellow on 

 the abdomen; caudal femora ochre yellow becoming tawny, ochra- 

 ceous and raw umber distad, caudal tibise dull heliotrope purple, the 

 spines yellowish narrowly tipped with black. 



General color of female bistre becoming wood brown ventrad; dor- 

 sum of the head, pronotum and anal area of the tegmina pale apple 

 green, the lateral carinse of the pronotum marked with blackish as 

 in the male but more narrowly; eyes raw umber blotched with bistre.

The types are the only specimens of this species which have been

 Several characters of the c? do not appear to be in accord with one's 

 ideas as to what the opposite sex of the ? type should be, but as neither 

 belongs to an old species of the genus I have thought best to associate 

 them, pending the acquisition of further material. In case the sexes 

 should prove to represent distinct species I would restrict the name

 most widely distributed species, and may be considered the type. 



The species of this genus are quite difficult to separate and the recogni- 

 tion of almost all the forms can be considered only tentative. The extent 

 of individual variation is great, both in structure and color, and reliable 

 characters for the separation of species are iew. The work of Bruner 

 in the Biologia is by far the best treatment of the genus so far published.

This series shows that the species varies somewhat in size (males 

 from 16 to 21 millimeters in total length), but little in color. All 

 except one d^ from Jalapa are of the same colors, allowance being 

 made, of course, for fading in the Sumichrast specimens, while the 

 Jalapa exception has the usual green dorsum replaced by a dull olive 

 tint, while the pronotum near the lateral lobes is not as distiactly 

 marked as in the other specimens. 



The ? specimen measures as follows: length of body, 22 mm.; 

 length of pronotum, 4.1 ; length of tegmen, 17; length of caudal femur,

The validity of this species appears to be somewhat doubtful, Giglio- 

 Tos himself ^ considering it a synonym of the North American 0. 

 maculipennis { = pelidna Burmeister). In this he is of course in error, 

 but it is extremely close to 0. punctata, which is so variable that 

 gracilis may only be an extreme with the lateral carinae more or less 

 obliterated between the first and third transverse sulci. The form is 

 rather more elongate, however, than in the average individual of 0. 

 punctata.

This large series of specimens, representing a verj'- considerable range, 

 I find cannot be divided into species on any one or number of the 

 innumerable characters of variation exhibited. The green and brown 

 phases of coloration, varied with maculations and distinct bars or uni- 

 form with practically no markings, and variations in the shape and 

 strength of the lateral carinae of the pronotum, in the length of the 

 tegmina and wings, in the form of the fastigium and eyes, some slight, 

 others pronounced, are all present, and on superficial examination 

 would appear to furnish good characters for dividing the series. At- 

 tempts along these lines, however, soon show how hopeless it would 

 be to erect species on even the most striking types, as intermediates 

 are present to connect them with any other extreme. 



Two specimens from Gualaquiza and Valle del Lamora, Equador, 

 received from the Turin Museum, labelled "Orphula olivacea" and 

 recorded as such by Giglio-Tos,^ are provisionally referred to this 

 species. They are clearly not 0. olivacea, as comparison with para- 

 typic material shows, and having been preserved in alcohol are badly 

 shrivelled in consequence.^

Four specimens, two of each sex, from Carcaraiia, Argentina, de- 

 termined as this species by Bruner, I am unable to separate from 

 my series of 'punctata, which includes material determined as that 

 species by Bruner. Individuals of the latter from Nicaragua, Costa 

 Rica and British Guiana resemble the Carcaraiia specimens very closely.

Two specimens, c? and 9 , one from Cordoba, the other from Car-

 able for study. I am of the opinion that this species will prove to be 

 merely a phase of the very variable 0. punctata.

The above records, with the Jalapa record given by Bruner in the 

 Biologia,^ constitute the sum of our knowledge of this species; It 

 appears to be restricted in its range, as suggested by Bruner, and the 

 taking of five specimens in one day shows it can hardly be called rare. 

 The species is apparently confined to the country on the lower eastern 

 slope of the Cofre de Perote. The compressed form of this insect will 

 readily separate it from allied species. The compression of the male 

 abdomen with its appendages is quite pronounced.

 quent page (p. 32), I will show to be the species later named Dichroatettix viridi-

This series exhibits considerable variation in the intensity of the 

 coloration, the dorsal aspect ranging in color from dull blackish brown 

 to mottled ochre and umber and again washed with dull green. The 

 paler lateral bands, including the ventral portion of the lateral lobes, 

 pleura and caudal femora are distinct in all the specimens examined 

 and in several are decidedly greenish; in these cases the gense are 

 also colored. Some individuals are distinctly maculate, or might 

 really be called tessellate, ochre and umber being the two colors. 

 Considerable variation in the sharpness of the angle of the fastigium 

 is also noticeable, and in both sexes. In some females the angle is 

 almost as acute as in some males. 



The species has previously been recorded by Giglio-Tos ^^ from 

 Gualaquiza, Cuchipamba and the valley of Santiago, Ecuador. 



GOMPHOCERI. 



The South American genera of this group are six in number, three 

 previously known and three recognized as the result of the present 

 study. Of these genera two will be described in a subsequent paper, 

 but they are mentioned here to show their position in the series. The 

 genera would stand as follows: 



Fenestra Giglio-Tos {=Dichroatettix Bruner). 



Staurorhectus Giglio-Tos. 



Isonyx n. gen. 



Borellia n. gen. 



Stereoteitix n. gen. 



Tristira Bruner. 



The first genus is quite distinct, as is the second. The next three 

 genera, Isonyx, Borellia and Stereoteitix, show some characters in 

 common, but differ in a number of others, such as the position of the 

 lateral foveolae and the relative proportion of the spurs. The last, 

 Tristira, is a quite distinct type, much isolated from the others and 

 immediately recognizable by its peculiar facies.

species. The only information we have is a footnote to the extent 

 that ' ' Ce genre est fonde sur une espece de Buenos Aires. ' ' The next 

 use of the name is by Gigho-Tos, who placed the species in hand in 

 that genus, in spite of the sanguineous wings, which appendages were 

 stated to be hyaline by Bruner. Bruner was apparently unacquainted 

 with the paper of Giglio-Tos and erected a new genus Dichroatettix 

 for a species, which is undoubtedly the same as F. hohlsii Giglio-Tos, 

 while Fenestra was applied to three species, which therefore require 

 a new generic name, a want supplied on a jM-evious page of this paper. ^^ 

 This genus is related to the North American genera Napaia and 

 Horesidotes. It can be distinguished from the former by the less 

 expanded antennae, the strongly constricted lateral carinas of the pro- 

 notum, the subequal prozona and metazona, the distinctly angulate 

 caudal margin of the pronotum, the longer tegmina with more definite 

 venation and the very peculiar cerci. From Horesidotes (which has 

 not been examined) it appears to differ in that the occiput has no 

 distinct median carina, the caudal margin is more angulate and the 

 lateral lobes of the pronotum are deeper than long.

This series shows that the green color of the face is not present in 

 some of the females, and in such as it is present the lateral lobes of 

 the pronotum are always, and generally also the dorsum, the pleura 

 and the caudal femora, except the apices, of the same color. All the 

 males examined have the face green. In some specimens the dorsum 

 of the pronotum is without the velvety black patches seen in others, 

 in fact about half the specimens are without them. Size, as exhibited 



" The name Dichroatettix might with justice be used for this genus if the un- 

 identifiabihty of the Brunnerian genus Fenestra precludes its use by GigUo-Tos. 

 As an unidentifiable name requires different treatment from a nomen nudum the 

 use of Fenestra once in such a way would by some be considered to preclude its 

 subsequent use, its existence terminating as a name when considered unidentifi- 

 able. A nomen nudum, being considered to express nothing definite, can be 

 properly used by a later author from whom it dates. An unidentifiable name, 

 on the other hand, represents something imperfectly and improperly presented 

 and should be discarded for all time. I have presented both views, the proper 

 presentation of the name by a later author and the complete elimination of the 

 name, and leave others to choose for themselves. In any case Giglio-Tos's 

 species bohlsii would stand.

The interesting series listed above exhibits a very great range of 

 variation with four distinct color forms in the ? ; the cJ^ is more uni- 

 formly colored. These forms I will designate a, h, c and d, lettering 

 from the most diversified to the most uniform type. 



Type a. A median longitudinal line from fastigium to tip of teg- 

 mina buff, flanked by lines of blackish brown on pronotum and teg- 

 mina, on the latter occupying all except a narrow proximal costal 

 line of pale yellow. Lateral carinse distinct, light, slightly constricted. 

 Light bar on head slightly margined with brownish. Remainder of 

 lateral aspect, and caudal femora except the dorsal blackish line and 

 the reddish distal section, grass green. Represented by twelve speci- 

 mens. 



Type 6. Similar to type a, but green replaced by ochraceous brown. 

 Represented by eight specimens. 



Type c. The dorsal median line in this type is almost lost and nearly 

 concolorous with the lateral bars, so that dorsum from the fastigium 

 caudad is nearly uniform. Represented by six specimens, 



^* It is quite possible this may prove to be the same as Compsacris Bolivar 

 {Anales Sac. Espaii. Hist. Nat., XIX, p. 314, 1890) based on one species — C. 

 pulcher — from "Villa Bella en el Peru," which is apparently ViUa Bella, Bolivia, 

 at the junction of the Beni and Mamore rivers. If such should prove to be the 

 case Compsacris would replace Staurorhectus. None of the species examined by

Type d. Tegmina colored much as in type a, but head, pronotum, 

 pleiu-a and Hmbs suffused with rose red, the usual markings being 

 only faintly indicated. Represented by eleven specimens. 



The largest 9 specimen (38 millimeters in length of body) belongs 

 to type c, the smallest (30 millimeters) to type a. The typical ? re- 

 ceived from the Tiu'in Museum has been immersed in a liquid preserva- 

 tive and it is impossible to tell to which type it belongs. 



One d^ individual has a coloration which would be con4dered type 

 c. while the other males are of a type which approximates closer to the 

 9 type h with, however, some greenish, but not on the caudal femora. 



The curve of the fastigium of the female varies from arcuate to dis- 

 tinctly angulate, and is more excavated in some than in others.

length, nearly two-thirds the length of the tegmen, moderately depressed 

 proximad and very slightly dilated. Pronotiim moderately rounded 

 but with a perceptible dorsal flattening; cephalic margin slightly 

 arcuate, caudal margin broadly obtuse-angulate with the angle 

 rounded, no lateral carinse present, but a moderate shoulder developed 

 on the metazona; greatest caudal width contained about one and two- 

 thirds in the length, metazona regularly and closely, but not deeply, 

 punctate; three distinct transverse sulci present on the dorsum, the 

 caudal only intersecting the median carina, which is distinct and regular ; 

 lateral lobes with the dorsal length very considerably greater than the 

 depth, ventral margin sinuato-angulate. Interspace between the 

 mesosternal lobes slightly longitudinal ; interspace between the meta- 

 sternal lobes hardly narrower than between the mesosternal lobes, 

 pentagonal. Tegmina very slightly exceeding the apex of the abdo- 

 men, but falling considerably short of the caudal femora; marginal 

 field with a very slight proximal dilation, apex rather narrowly rounded, 

 no intercalary vein present. Wings ample. Abdomen consider- 

 ably compressed. Caudal femora considerably inflated proximad, the 

 distal section quite slender, pattern of the pagina very distinct, regu- 

 lar; caudal tibiae very slightly shorter than the femora, gently sinuate, 

 the external margins with eleven or twelve spines, 

 internal spurs slightly unequal; tarsi with tlistinct, 

 rounded arolia. 



General color apple green, becoming more oil 

 green on the caudal femora. Two broad lines, 



one on each side, of vandyke brown start from 



the margins of the fastigium, cross the dorsum 



of the eyes, extend over the pronotum, and on 



the tegmina broaden out and occupy the entire 



discoidal and all except the proximal portion of the 



marginal fields. On the head the color of these bars 



is decidedly blackish brown, about true vandyke 



brown on the pronotum, becoming dilute and 



fainter as the stripe broadens on the tegmina, 



while along the ventral margins of these bars the 



green is touched with yellowish, while the light 



proximal section of the marginal field is cream 



color. Antennse vandyke brown with the proxi-

 being as follows: December 21, 1904; January 26, February 15, March 

 7, 18 and 21, 1905. This series is rather uniform in size, two females, 

 however, being appreciably smaller than the others. In color one 

 specimen has the green more glaucous, while several others show a 

 tendency in the same direction. One specimen has the caudal femora, 

 the lateral lobes and the face suffused with orange vermilion. The 

 intensity of the longitudinal bars appears to vary very little; on the 

 tegmina, however, some specimens are more strongly colored than 

 others. 



ISONYX n. gen.20 



This genus probably is closer related to Borellia Rehn ^^ than to 

 Staurorhectus, and may possibly be considered a distinct and separate 

 type with no close relationship to either the above mentioned genera. 

 The characters are so contradictory and the facies so different that 

 the author does not feel jvistified in making detailed comparisons, but 

 prefers to present the rather striking features of the form in the general 

 description. It might be added that this position is assigned to 

 Isonyx after studying all the South American Gomphoceri, both genera 

 and species.

A paratj^ic series of six females has also been examined (February 

 13, 15 and 27, March 17 and 21, 1905). This series shows that the 

 species varies somewhat but not greatly in size, and the coloration 

 presents a considerable range of base tones and finer definition of 

 markings without much modification of such pattern as is found in 

 the types. Two specimens are touched with green as in the ? type, 

 but both have it weaker on the head and tegmina, and the lateral 

 carinse are broadly marked with the same tint on the metazona, and the 

 caudal femora have distinct oblique blackish bars. Other specimens 

 have the lighter general colors replaced by ferruginous or wood 

 brown, giving a warm rufescent type or a rather sandy form, while 

 the femoral bars are present as variations irrespectively of color form 

 All the females except the type have the lateral carinse marked with 

 lighter on the metazona. One of the rufescent type has the dark colors 

 all blackish, presenting a strong contrast with the other ferruginous 

 patches. 



SOYLLIN^. 



After examining individuals of all the genera of the Scyllinoe except 

 Eupnigodcs McNeill and Zapata Bruner, the following arrangement of 

 the genera seems to be desirable as it appears to express their natural 

 relations : 



Boopedon Thomas. 



Euplectrotettix Bruner. 



Scyllina Stal. 



Eupnigodcs McNeill. 



Zapata Bruner. 



Psoloessa Scudcler, 



Stirapleura Scudder. 



Ageneotettix McNeill. 



Aulocara Scudder. 



Ligurotettix McNeill. 




40 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



The position of Eupnigodes and Zapata is taken from other authors, 

 while Ligurotettix is placed here instead of in the Epacromioe, as it is 

 quite different from Mecostethus and Epacromia, approaching Aulocara 

 in some respects. While no doubt somewhat aberrant Ligurotettix is 

 clearly a member of the Scyllinse, the intercalary vein, for example, 

 being no stronger than is the case in many specimens of Aulocara.

These specimens are all larger than the measurements given by Bruner, 

 but otherwise do not appear to materially differ. The series is quite 

 uniform in size, and an average c? and 9 measure as follows : 



Length of body, 18.5 mm. 25 mm. 



Length of pronotum, 3.5 " 4.8 " 



Length of tegmen, 15.5 " 21 " 



Length of caudal femur, 11.5 " 15.2 '' 



Two distinct types of coloration are present, one irregularly 

 mottled and washed with fuscous, the other with a light orange 

 ochraceous median bar on the head and pronotum, flanked by blackish 

 lateral lines, which are filiform on the head and broader on the pro- 

 notum. The tegmina in the latter type also possess a pair of light 

 parallel longitudinal lines on the anal areas. 



The indications of femoral bars mentioned by Bruner are quite 

 strong in nearly all the females and several of the males examined, 

 w^hile the blackish genicular region of the cJ' and the orange-red 

 abdomen of the same sex are quite striking.

Of the various species here considered a series of one hundred and 

 fifty-six specimens have been examined, including typical material 

 of the five species described by Bruner. Thorough consideration of 

 this material shows that no tangible characters exist for separating 

 Scyllina, Pseudostauronotus and Plectrotettix even as subgenera as 

 proposed by Bruner.^^ The characters on which the subdivisions 

 were there made are: the presence or absence of an intercalary vein in 

 the post-radial area, the cells of this region being accordingly arranged 

 in two series or else irregularly reticulate; the caudal lobe of the 

 pronotum either subequal to or longer than the cephalic; the inner 

 claw of the hind tibiae more or not more than twice the length of the 

 outer, and the number of spines on the outer margin of the hind tibise 

 (9 to 12 or 1.3 to 16). 



The first of these characters can usually be depended upon as stable, 

 but in this genus the intercalary vein is by no means a stable character 

 being present or absent in individuals of the same species, and in some 

 cases varying in an individual to the extent that it is distinct on one 

 tegmen and absent on the other. The proportions of the lobes of the 

 pronotum are also found to vary, as in species belonging unquestion- 

 ably to the section supposed to have subequal divisions the caudal 

 section distinctly exceeds the cephalic in length, while the reverse is 

 the case in other species. The length and shape of the tibial claws 

 while diagnostic when the type species alone are compared, is without 

 value when other forms are considered ; specimens of varipes, which 

 is allied to conspersa, has the spurs no longer than is found in Mexican 

 forms referred to Plectrotettix. The number of tibial spines is a char- 

 acter which appears unworthy of use in separating subgenera, especially 

 when the extent of variation is such as to cause great doubt as to which 

 division a particular specimen belongs. 



Wliile the type of the genus Gomphocerus {Epacromia) peragrans 

 Stal,^^ has not been recognized since the original description, a cir- 

 cumstance probably due to the fact that the type locality is an unfre-

quented one, the description is such that it could be identified with 

 Httle difficulty. 



The name Pseudostauronotus was proposed by Giglio-Tos under the 

 impression that the type, hrunneri, was a member of the very insuffi- 

 ciently described genus to which Brunner applied the same name two 

 years previously .^^ As Brunner's name rests on a description of seven 

 words without included species or tjrpe mentioned, it is really a nomen 

 nudum and as such not invalidating the later use of the name by Giglio- 

 Tos, even when used in misapprehension. Scudder has shown ^^ from 

 the evidence of material sent him by Brunner that Pseudostauronotus 

 of that author equals his much older Stirapleura. 



Some species of the genus appear to resemble species of Boopedon, 

 others forms of Stirapleura and several have a striking superficial 

 resemblance to forms of the Locustine genus Schistocerca. The fol- 

 lowing arrangement appears to present their relationship as clearly as 

 possible in a linear arrangement. 



Species but little variegated, the coloration rather uniform; lateral 

 carinas of the pronotum moderately arcuate, not prominent; super- 

 ficially resembling Boopedon.

This species is closely allied to S. uniformis, but differs in the sharper 

 caudal angle of the pronotum, the longer metazona of the pronotum 

 (much longer than the prozona), the slightly narrower interspace be- 

 tween the eyes and the rather different type of coloration. 



Size medium ; form robust. Head with the f astigium broad, rounded 

 rectangulate, depressed area crescentic, interspace between the eyes 

 equal to the interantennal width of the frontal costa, lateral foveolse

 rounds into the frontal costa without' angle; frontal costa broad, sub- 

 equal, slightly constricted above the antennae, two rows of punctures 

 dorsad; supplementary facial carinas indistinct ventrad; eyes acute 

 reniform, slightly longer than the infraocular portion of the 

 genae; antennae slender, slightly depressed proximad. Pronotum

 regular; caudal tibiae with eleven spines laterad, longer internal spur 

 slightly more than twice the length of the shorter, sharply curved

In addition to the types a paratypic series of five males (September 

 5 and 14, 1900) have been examined. Considerable color variation is 

 presented by this series, which is roughly divisible into three types; 

 one (a) with the dorsum of the pronotum unicolorous, which is repre- 

 sented by the type alone, another (h) wdth a rather pale median pro- 

 notal line flanked laterad by blackish, represented by three individuals, 

 and a third (c) wath a pronotal cross as in the 9 wdth the caudal margin 

 of the pronotum as pale as the cross, represented by two specimens. 

 The median pale line is distinctly carried to the tips of the tegmina 

 in one of type b, while the transverse tegminal bars are rather regular 

 and distinct, though not complete in some specimens ; a pale proximal 

 tegminal line is present in two individuals of type h. The dorsiun of 

 the caudal femora is distinctly barred in both of type c, and faintly in 

 one of type b, while the lateral face shows distinct oblique bars in several 

 specimens. The color of the caudal tibise in all males other than the 

 type is as in the ? type. A single 6^ specimen from Sapucay, Para- 

 guay (III 9.05; Foster, No. 195 part), in the Hebard Collection, is 

 referred to this species. It presents a rather different appearance 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 45 



when compared with the typical series, but the differences are wholly 



of color. The dorsum of the pronotum is to a large extent velvety 



black, broken at the sulci, while the lateral carinse are marked as in 



specimens of type c, but darker, with the median longitudinal bar 



present.

This specimen is considerably darker than any strongly marked 



specimen of this species seen. The whole insect is quite dark except 



for the light femoral bars, but the pattern is still distinctly visible, 



the medio-dorsal and lateral bars being present, and the 'tegminal 



streak clear apple. green. The size of this specimen is slightly greater 



than Matto Grosso specimens.

Paratypic specimens, a d^ and 9 . of this species, loaned by Prof. 

 Bruner, have been examined. They differ from brasiliensis in the 

 slightly smaller size, rather slenderer form, less divergent carinae of 

 the pronotum and the more acute fastigium. The color of the caudal 

 tibiae is of little diagnostic value, as in other species of the genus, the 

 male in hand having them wholly red, the female ochraceous with the 

 dorsal surface purplish distad and reddish proximad.

The species is closely related to pratensis, but differs in the narrower 



space between the eyes and the greater interantennal constriction of 



the frontal costa. It is interesting to note that the known ranges of 



these very closely related species are separated by a distance of over 



two thousand miles, in the land areas of which, as far as at present 



known, no species of the genus is found.

The Sapucay specimens loaned by Prof. Bruner are marked as types, 

 although the locality southern Brazil is given with the original brief 

 description. 



The variation in the intensity of the markings of this species is quite 

 considerable. The males appear to be, for this genus, rather uniform 

 in coloration, and the variation in size is not very great. The females, 

 however, vary greatly in the amount and shade of green coloring, 

 some having the dorsal face of the caudal femora, head and the greater 

 portion of the pronotum and pleura rather pale apple green, while 

 others have these parts mottled and overlaid more or less strongly 

 with dull brown. In a few specimens the green, except the tegminal 

 bar, is wholly replaced with a shade of brown, but in such cases the 

 pattern remains the same. In the material examined but very few 

 specimens have the characteristic pattern obscured and even in those 

 cases it is not obliterated. 



As a series the females are quite uniform in size, one Sapucay female, 

 however, being quite large. This latter individual is also very deeply 

 colored.

Through the kindness of Prof. Bruner I have before me the type of 

 this species, a 9 from Sapucay, Paraguay. From the material in 

 hand it appears that this species has several color forms, as in brunneri 

 and other species. The type has the dorsal surface of the head and 

 pronotum uniform wood brown without cruciform markings or longi- 

 tudinal median stripe, and a majority of the females and several of the 

 males examined belong to this type. Several males and females have 

 the dorsum dark with weak, but distinct, cruciform pronotal markings 

 and a longitudinal light bar of variable prominence, in some cases 

 absent. In about half the specimens the heavy blackish markings 

 on the lateral lobes of the pronotum and caudad and ventrad of the 

 eyes are distinct, while the dorsal bars of the caudal femora are dis- 

 tinct in the greater number, weak and interrupted in several others 

 mcluding the type, dorso-lateral carina of the femora marked ventrad 

 with blackish in all specimens, very distinct in some, broken and 

 faint in others, the genicular lobes also blackish.

These specimens have been compared with typical individuals 

 kindly loaned by Prof. Bruner. This species is very richly colored 

 and one of the more easily recognized forms, the distinct femoral bars 

 and the entirely black genicular region being quite striking in all the 

 specimens examined. Considerable superficial resemblance exists to 

 *S. conspersa, which is found in the same locality, but the angle of the 




48 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



face and the shorter and heavier caudal femora, as well as the color 

 of the caudal tibise, serve to separate it without difficulty. In the case 

 of this species and S. conspersa the colors of the tibiae appear to be 

 constant, all the specimens of conspersa examined having the distal 

 section dark bluish, while the deep rich crimson of the distal two-thirds 

 of varipes is clear and uniform in the whole series.

Specimens recorded by the author as this species from Texolo, 

 La Joya, San Luis Potosi and Alta Mira, Tamaulipas, when re-examined 

 in the light of recent work on the Mexican and Central American 

 forms of the genus, prove to represent true viatoria. The males have 

 the dorsal face of the caudal femora distinctly barred, while the 

 females have these parts almost uniform green. 

 Scyllina calida (Bruner). 



1904. Plectrotettix calidus Bruner, Biol. Cent.-Amer., Orth., II, p. 101 

 [Cuernavaca, Morelos and Guerrero, Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica.] 



Previous records of the author of viatoria from Cuernavaca, Uruapan, 

 Gualajara, Zapotlanejo and Zapotlan should be referred to this species. 



The range of variation in size and coloration in this form is very 

 great, some individuals having the colors weak and poorly defined, 

 while other individuals from the same locality are quite richly colored. 

 The width, number and intensity of the transverse bars of the tegmina 

 also varies greatly as in some individuals they are as broad as the inter- 

 vening sections, while in others they are broken, imperfect and rather 

 pardaline in character and distribution.

A male and two females of this species from Tacubaya show that this 

 is probably the most striking Mexican species. These individuals 

 have been previously recorded by the author as viatoria. The rather 

 short tegmina, more robust form and heavier caudal femora will 

 assist in separating this from the allied species. These specimens 

 show practically no green, the light shades being ochres.

This large series exliibits a very great amount of individual variation 

 in size and color. The females range in total length from 13 to 20 

 millimeters, the males varying proportionately. The color ranges 

 from a mottled black-brown and gray with femoral bars and weakly 

 lateral carinse of the pronotum, to another with the general color pale 

 with broad dark lateral bars on the dorsum of the head and pronotum 

 with a broad pale median bar, a longitudinal dark bar on the tegmina 

 flanked toward the costa by a pale green line, and the femora with 

 bars and suffused along the dorso-lateral carinse with blackish. The 

 latter type has the markings of the lateral lobes of the pronotum quite 

 distinct and the genicular regions of the caudal femora and tibise are 

 paler than in the other type, in which these portions are blackish. 

 These differences are irrespective of locality and date, and are con- 

 nected by dozens of intermediates.

 common species.

PHYLOGENY OF THE EACES OF VOLUTILITHES PETROSTJS. 



by burnett smith, ph.d. 

 Introduction. 



In a recent article * the author has described some of the shell char- 

 acters which, occurring in the later stages of Gastropod ontogeny and 

 phylogeny, mark the gerontic or senile condition of the individual or 

 of the race. It was seen that these senile features may at times be as 

 useful to the student of phylogeny as those of the earlier stages, which 

 latter have always received the more attention. In the paper referred 

 to, the attempt was made to show that the modern Fulgur carica of 

 our New Jersey coast is the descendant of a main F. carica stock, 

 which originated in Miocene time ; and that such forms as F. maxivium 

 and its allies, which had heretofore been regarded as ancestral by 

 Grabau ^ and others, are in reality not so at all, but senile offshoots 

 which at an early period in the history of the stock diverged from the 

 main line of descent. The paucity of individuals representing the 

 forms considered ancestral, and the extreme abundance of the speci 

 mens of senile forms, was a source of some embarrassment to the 

 author. It is therefore with considerable satisfaction that I am now 

 able, though in another genus {Volutilithes), to present a series in 

 which the forms comprising the main ancestral stock are nearly as 

 plentiful as those which represent the senile offshoots. 



The history of certain of the species of Volutilithes can be well traced 

 in the Eocene of our Gulf States, but nowhere better than in Alabama, 

 where the fine sections along the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers have 

 furnished abundant material for the study of the geological and geo- 

 graphical distribution of these forms. The races and species studied 

 range from the Matthew's Landing horizon in Alabama to the Jackson 

 horizon in Mississippi, and therefore represent a fair proportion of the 

 phylogenetic units through nearly the whole of the Eocene. They are 

 likewise restricted to a small geographical area, and the geological 

 sections in which they appear are unusually good.

The material at my disposal is very full and complete,^ and has 

 enabled me to study large series of individuals. These series in each 

 case represent the forms in the proportions in which they occur in the 

 field, and therefore offer every opportunity for obtaining the average 

 racial characters in any particular locality or horizon. 



Morphology. 



The genus Volutilithes is widely distributed throughout our Southern 

 Eocene. At some localities several sharp and distinct species occur, 

 but at most of the localities Volutilithes is represented by one species 

 and by a particular race of that species. The term race is used in place 

 of variety, for in these assemblages the individuals frequently differ 

 widely. There is, however, always an average of characters which 

 stamps the stage of evolution which the race has attained. Of course, 

 extreme specimens often have more of the features of some other race 

 than of the race to which they belong, but these individuals are always 

 few; and there is never any difficulty in recognizing the general race 

 characters for any particular geographical point, and the phase of 

 phylogenetic development found in the faunule at that point. In 

 cases of this sort, the introduction of varietal and specific names is to 

 be deprecated, and the adoption of the system of race analysis is 

 strongly urged by the author. 



In the forms under consideration, the first two or three whorls are 

 smooth and rounded, constituting the Smooth Stage. The first orna- 

 mental feature to appear on the smooth, rounded whorl is the trans- 

 verse rib, that is, a slight elevation on the whorl which runs across it 

 from suture to suture. These early ribs are invariably curved slightly, 

 and each one is simple and uniform from suture to suture. The curved 

 ribs persist as a rule for about a quarter or a half of a whorl, or even for 

 a much less space; in fact, sometimes we have only one or two of them. 

 This Curved Rib Stage is short but remarkably constant, and though 

 occasionally much suppressed, has been found in every species and race 

 dealt with in this paper. 



The curved ribs, after about one-third of a whorl, change abruptly 

 into the straight ribs of what has been designated the Cancellated *

 of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and was brought together largely by Mr. 

 Charles W. Johnson, now of the Boston Society of Natural History. The col- 

 lections are a tribute to his skill and perseverance as a collector, and are an example 

 of what museum research collections should be.

Stage, which begins by the appearance of two swelhngs or tubercles 

 on each rib. One of these tubercles is near the suture, and the other 

 at the position which is later occupied by the shoulder angle. They 

 will be referred to as the suture and shoulder tubercles respectively. 

 These two tubercles are often of nearly equal size at the start, though 

 frequently the suture tubercle is the larger. Tubercles other than 

 these two mentioned are seldom visible on an early rib ; but when a 

 sufficiently small shell is obtainable, other smaller tubercles can be 

 seen upon each rib, and the tubercles diminish in size quite regularly 

 from the suture tubercle downward. Each tubercle is connected with 

 the corresponding tubercle of the next rib by a faint spiral, the first 

 appearance of the definite cancellation which later becomes more 

 pronounced. In most specialized forms the shoulder angle develops 

 shortly after the appearance of the tubercles. 



The cancellated condition is found more or less well developed in 

 all the different races. In primitive species ^ it may persist as a con- 

 stant feature to the end of the individual's life; but in most forms it 

 covers only a few whorls and is more variable than the preceding 

 Curved Rib Stage, in that certain of its features change as the shell 

 grows. These changes are gradual, but they render the end of the 

 Cancellated Stage much less definite than its beginning. They may 

 be briefly summarized as follows : The tubercles, with the exception of 

 the shoulder tubercle, usually tend to degenerate, and soon disappear, 

 though their corresponding faint spirals may sometimes persist. 



The shoulder tubercle, on the contrary, becomes stronger and sharper. 

 First the ribbing above the shoulder disappears, and later the ribbing 

 below the shoulder shortens, and with its practical disappearance 

 what might be termed the Spiny Stage is inaugurated. 



In the Spiny Stage the shoulder tubercle is now sharp and spine-like. 

 Other tubercles have disappeared and the spirals are, as a rule, re- 

 stricted to the region of the anterior siphon. Ribbing has practically 

 gone, but very short rudiments may sometimes still be present below 

 the shoulder spines. The commencement of this stage.is never sharp, 

 for it is the result of gradual change from the preceding one.® It is 



5 In A771. Nat. for 1902, Vol. 36, p. 926, Grabau says: "It is perhaps not too 

 much to say that in the majority of the larger phyletic series, except those highly 

 specialized, the radicle is a smooth, round-whorled form, succeeded by types in 

 which the adults are ribbed, and later cancellated, after which progressive modi- 

 fication may be carried further." 



'No morphological distinction is made between spine and tubercle. "The 

 writer considers that the difference between the small rounded tubercle of the 

 early whorls and the large, sharp spine of the later whorl is one merely of degree. 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. ^5 



not reached in all species, but occurs usually as the end term of normal 

 progressive development in the ontogeny, and of slow and even evolu- 

 tion in the phylogeny. 



The Spiny Stage, then, may sometimes be present as a well-defined 

 stage, but it may also be-accompanied by extreme individual variation 

 and by features of senility. These latter characterize the Senile 

 Stage, and may follow regularly after the Spiny Stage; but, as stated 

 above, they not infrequently are thrown back by acceleration, and 

 found together in the same whorl with the features of the Spiny Stage. 



The Senile Stage, whether following normally after the Spiny Stage 

 or associated with it, is always easily distinguished. In the forms 

 under consideration its most important features are the following : ^ 



1. Tendency for the shoulder spines to pass into a shoulder keel. 



2. Irregularity of growth lines. 



3. Thickening of the shell. 



4. Encroachment of the anal siphon upward on the preceding whorl. 



5. Protrusion of the mantle m the region of the anal siphon, pro- 

 ducing a smoothing of the preceding whorl by a shelly overgrowth. 



These five characters are all sometimes found together in one in- 

 dividual or race, but, as a rule, only two or three of them are so asso- 

 ciated. 



In studying the development of the shell features, each whorl has 

 been taken up in detail, and its particular ornamental characteristics 

 noted. Of course, this system is more or less arbitrary, and at times

inaccurate, on account of the acceleration of features in certain in- 

 dividuals. In the following study, the writer has endeavored to get 

 the average characters for a certain whorl, except where individual 

 variation is great. In this latter case the variations are noted. 



The word spine is therefore used, throughout this paper, simply in a descriptive 

 sense, and implies no difference from the early tubercle, except that it is larger and 

 sharper. Both are produced by the same fold in the mantle, and every gradation 

 between the two is observable." Smith, Burnett, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 

 May, 1905, p. 347. This opinion is quite different from that held by Grabau 

 (see Am. Nat., Vols. 36, 37).

In counting the whorls, it has been attempted to have the end of 

 the first whorl come in about the position shown in the figure. It is 

 impossible to make an absolutely exact count, but if care is used there 

 will seldom be much of an error in the last whorl. As stated above, 

 the method is purely arbitrary, but it seemed to the writer to be the 

 only practical way in which the statistics of the development of orna- 

 mental features could be arranged.

Whorls 1, 2, 3 — Smooth and rounded. 



Whorl 4 — Smooth and rounded, except toward the end, where the 

 curved rib stage may start. 



Whorl 5 — The curved rib stage often commences early in five, per- 

 sisting as a rule for about a quarter of a whorl. The cancellated stage 

 follows abruptly with its straight, tubercled ribs. These tubercles 

 are largest at the suture, decreasing regularly in size anteriorl}^ on each 

 rib. Each tubercle is connected with the corresponding tubercle of 

 the next rib by a faint spiral. A shoulder angle is never developed. 



Whorls 6, 7 — Characterized by the cancellated stage and much like 

 the latter part of five. 



Whorl 8 — Characterized by the cancellated stage and much like 

 six and seven. The tubercles nearest the suture are the strongest, and 

 they diminish in size regularly as the rib is followed anteriorly. The 

 ribs are also less prominent anteriorly, disappearing entirely on the 

 branchial siphon. Spirals cover the entire whorl. 



Whorls 9, 10 — jNIuch as in eight, the cancellated stage still persisting. 




li)06.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 57 



The tubercles are a little sharp, and the protruded mantle shows a 

 very slight tendency to smooth the preceding whorl — a tendency which 

 in later forms results in a senile feature. 



Remarks. — This form possesses no stage later than the cancellated 

 stage and never has a shoulder angle. The suture tubercle is through- 

 out life the dominant one. The specimens are remarkably uniform, 

 no perceptible individual variation occurring. The smooth stage is 

 very long. From its primitive characteristics, and its geological posi- 

 tion near the base of the Eocene, the wTiter has no hesitation in assign- 

 ing to it an ancestral position among the races and species dealt with 

 in this paper.

Whorls 1,2, 3 — Smooth and rounded. 



Whorl 4 — Smooth and rounded, except near the end, where in many 

 individuals the ciu'ved rib stage begins. 



Whorl 5 — The curved rib stage usually occupies the latter part of 

 four and early part of five. Its ribs are wide apart and it persists for 

 about a quarter of a whorl. It is followed by the straight, tubercled 

 ribs of the cancellated stage. The two upper tubercles are the largest, 

 those below becoming fainter anteriorly. The ribs die away anteriorly 

 on the branchial siphon. Each tubercle is connected with the corre- 

 sponding one of the next whorl by a spiral. 




58 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



Whorls 6, 7, 8 — All characterized by the cancellated stage. Changes, 

 however, take place during these whorls. At first the ornamentation, 

 is much like that of the cancellated stage in V. limopsis, but later the 

 ribs become relatively farther apart and broader (in a spiral direction). 

 At the same time many fine riblets are introduced between the pri- 

 mary ribs. The tubercles are largest near the suture and become smaller 

 as the ribs die away anteriorly. There is never a distinct shoulder 

 angle. The whorls are covered with spirals. 



Whorl 9 — Individual variation now sets in. In some specimens the 

 whorl is much as in eight. In others the rib is swollen into a very 

 rounded, transversely long angle which hardly occupies the position 

 of the shoulder angle of later forms, and in addition the shells become 

 thick. In all individuals the mantle protrudes in the region of the 

 anal siphon, and tends to smooth the preceding whorl with a shelly 

 overgrowth. This latter is never extreme. 



Wliorl 10 — Much as in nine, though here the forms with swollen 

 ribs predominate. In many specimens the shells become thick, the 

 growth lines irregular, and the smoothing of the preceding whorl by 

 the shelly overgrowth is quite well marked, though it never becomes 

 extreme as in some forms of later time. 



Remarks. — This species in its earlier stages of growth closely re- 

 sembles V. limopsis. It differs radically, however, from that form 

 with the progress of its ontogeny. Though its individuals vary greatly, 

 it is nevertheless entitled (in the opinion of the author) to rank as a 

 distinct species. In its later whorls there is great individual variation, 

 accompanied by senile features. These latter, though never extreme, 

 are well marked. They comprise protrusion of the mantle in the 

 region of the anal siphon, producing a smoothing of the preceding 

 whorl by a shelly overgrowth; thickening of the shell, and irregularity 

 of growth lines. There is no spiny stage. V. rugatus is considered 

 to be a short senile offshoot from V. limopsis. In the absence of 

 intermediate forms this evolution must have taken place either at 

 some other locality or at some geologically earlier date. 



Volutilithes petrosus Conrad. 



The forms described at the present day under this name represent 

 an assemblage of races. If every gradation of evolutional develop- 

 ment did not exist among them, many of these races would doubtless 

 now be regarded as distinct species. In fact, there are several dis- 

 carded specific names which were used in this way by Conrad and Lea. 

 Each race is an assemblage of individuals, showing more or less in- 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 59 



dividual variation, yet nevertheless possessing on the average definite 

 racial characters. In other words, the majority of specimens from 

 any one locality or horizon show a certain stage of evolution. Some 

 of the specimens may show developmental features characterizing 

 either a more primitive or a less primitive race; but these specimens 

 are few, and are not typical of the average of individuals from the 

 locality or horizon to which they belong. 



The races of V. petrosus are known to range from the A^anafalia beds 

 to the Jackson beds inclusive. The original specific description '^ is 

 accompanied by a figure of a member of the Claiborne race. Though 

 this particular race is perhaps not the most typical expression of the 

 V. petrosus main stock, the writer feels that no better method can be 

 employed than to use the name V. petrosus to designate the assemblage 

 of races under discussion. 



Several of the races differ in the development of senile characters 

 from the V. petrosus main stock, but there is every gradation between 

 these and the representatives of the main stock. On account of this 

 gradation the senile forms are included as races of V. petrosus, in spite 

 of the fact that their old individuals differ greatly in appearance from 

 those of the more normal type. 



The young of all the races, senile and otherwise, are remarkably 

 uniform and constant. The early whorls indicate clearly that they 

 are all descended from a cancellated ancestor, and bear a strong re- 

 semblance, especially in the cancellated stage, to the characters of 

 V. limopsis. In the absence of any record of a V. petrosus being found 

 below the horizon of the Nanafalia beds, the author believes that it 

 is perfectly safe to conclude that all these races in question are de- 

 scended from the V. limopsis of the Matthew's Landing horizon.

Nanafalia Race. 



Locality — Nanafalia, Ala. 



The only specimen known to the writer from this horizon is not suf- 

 ficiently well preserved to admit of its accurate study whorl for whorl. 

 It is, however, a perfectly normal specimen of moderate size and ex- 

 presses the general characters of the V. petrosus main stock. It is 

 about the size of the eight-whorled individuals of the Gregg's Landing 

 or the Jackson races. When it is placed in line with such specimens, 

 the three shells exhibit very few differences. This Nanafalia individual

has spines in its last whorl which make it resemble the Jackson race 

 quite closely. In this respect it is nearer the Jackson specimens than 

 the Gregg's Landing specimens. Its mantle perhaps smooths the 

 preceding whorl a trifle more than does the mantle in the Jackson race. 

 However, in its general features, it is very close to the Jackson form. 

 The amount which the mantle has smoothed the preceding whorl is 

 about equal to that found in shells of the same size from Gregg's 

 Landing.

Gregg's Landing Race. 



Locality — Gregg's Landing, Alabama River, Ala. 



Whorls 1, 2, 3 — Smooth and rounded. 



Whorl 4 — The curved rib stage begins early in four. It persists for 

 a quarter or a third of a whorl, but changes abruptly into the can- 

 cellated stage with its straight, tubercled ribs. The shoulder and 

 suture tubercles are of about the same size at first. By the end of 

 four the shoulder angle is quite well developed. 



Whorl 5 — Characterized by the cancellated stage and much like the 

 latter part of four. Suture and shoulder tubercles are of about the 

 same size. The shoulder angle is well developed. Tubercles are 

 connected by fine spirals. 



Whorl 6 — Characterized by the cancellated stage, but changes occur. 

 The shoulder tubercle is becoming stronger, while the suture tubercle 

 is getting weaker. The ribbing above the shoulder angle is also 

 becoming weaker. 



Whorl 7 — Still characterized by the cancellated stage, but here 

 the suture tul^ercle has disappeared and is only represented by its 

 spiral. The ribbing above the shoulder angle has gone, though it is 

 still well represented below the shoulder angle. 



Whorl 8 — Still characterized by the cancellated stage and much like 

 whorl seven. Below the shoulder angle the whorl is covered with fine 

 spirals. There is a very slight smoothing of the preceding whorl by 

 the protruded mantle, for the end of the cancellated stage is not sharp 

 like that of the curved rib stage. 



Whorl 9 — From here on individual variation is great. Some forms 

 have a whorl much as in eight, with the ribbing still well developed 

 below the shoulder, though the shoulder tubercles are more spine- 

 like. In other specimens the ribbing below the shoulder is gone, the 

 shoulder spines are more extreme, and the anal siphon shows a tend- 

 ency to encroach upward on the preceding whorl. In addition, these 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 61 



latter forms have a heavier shell, and the shelly smoothing of the pre- 

 ceding whorl by the protruded mantle is more marked. 



Whorl 10 — Here again we have every gradation between forms char- 

 acterized by the spiny stage, in which the preceding whorl has been 

 only slightly smoothed by the mantle, and forms which show a moder- 

 ate development of senile features. These latter show the tendency 

 for the spines to pass into a shoulder keel. They also possess a thick 

 shell with irregular growth lines, the anal siphon encroaches upward, 

 and the preceding whorl is smoothed by the shelly overgrowth of the 

 protruded mantle. Though these latter forms possess senile features, 

 these features are only slightly developed. They are, in fact, just the 

 beginnings of those characteristics which become so extreme in some 

 of the races of later time. 



Remarks. — This race occurs in the Gregg's Landing marl. The 

 greater number of individuals of the Gregg's Landing race have a 

 perfectly normal ontogeny, and in their later whorls have the spiny 

 stage well marked. These individuals belong therefore to the V. 

 petrosus main stock, and as they form a majority of the assemblage, 

 they determine the position of the race to be on the main stock. A 

 minority of individuals, however, show senile featiu'es. These senile 

 features are not well marked, but they indicate that here in this race 

 was inaugurated the tendency which resulted in the development of 

 the senile races of later time. In other words, we have here the point 

 where a senile offshoot is starting to branch from the main ancestral 

 stock. The marks of this tendency are but slight, and the individuals 

 are few; yet, nevertheless, the tendency is plainly recognizable.

Whorl 4 — The curved rib stage commences early in four and per- 

 sists for about a quarter of a whorl. It is followed by the straight, 

 tubercled ribs of the cancellated stage. The suture and shoulder 

 tubercles are about equal in size, and the shoulder angle soon becomes 

 well marked. Spirals connect the tubercles. 



Whorl 5 — Characterized by the cancellated stage and closely re- 

 sembles the latter part of foiu'. 



Whorl 6 — Characterized by the cancellated stage. Suture tubercles 

 grow w^eaker, shoulder tubercles grow stronger. Ribbing above the 

 shoulder also grows weaker, but it is well marked below the shoulder. 



Whorl 7 — Much as in six. 




62 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



Whorl 8 — Still characterized by the cancellated stage, but the suture 

 tubercles and the ribbing above the shoulder have now gone. Shoul- 

 der tubercles are stronger. Ribbing below the shoulder is weaker. 

 The beginning of the tendency to form a shelly overgrowth is seen, 

 and the cancellated stage comes to an end. 



Whorl 9 — Ribbing is about gone and the shoulder tubercles have 

 become spines. In other words, the spiny stage has set in. In most 

 individuals, however, the senile characters are also mingled with those 

 of the spiny stage. The shell gets thicker, and the mantle protrudes 

 in the region of the anal siphon, and smooths the preceding whorl with 

 a shelly overgrowth. This latter, though not extreme, often covers 

 the spines of eight, which, however, are visible through it. 



Whorls 10, 11, 12 — In these whorls we simply have an exaggeration 

 of the characters of nine. The features of the spiny stage and the 

 marks of senility are found together in the same whorl. Toward the 

 end senile characters are quite well marked. The shell becomes 

 thick, the growth lines irregular, the anal siphon encroaches upward, 

 and the shoulder spines tend to pass into a shoulder keel. In addition, 

 the shelly overgrowth produced by the protruded mantle is well 

 marked, and in some specimens may be quite thick. As a rule, how- 

 ever, the spines of the preceding whorl can be counted through the 

 shelly envelope. 



Remarks. — ^This race occurs in the Bell's Landing marl. Though 

 occasionally a rare specimen may nearly approach the V. petrosus 

 main stock in its general features, the vast majority of individuals 

 show such a development of senile characters that it is necessary to 

 consider the race to be a senile offshoot from the main stem. These 

 senile marks though typical are not highly developed. This race 

 unquestionably sprang from the senile individuals which occurred as a 

 minority in the otherwise normal, geologically earlier Gregg's Landing 

 race.

 Suture tubercles weaker, shoulder tubercles stronger. 



Whorl 7 — Much as in latter part of six. 



Whorl 8 — Still characterized by the cancellated stage, but the suture 

 tubercles are gone, and are represented only by their spiral. Ribbing 

 above the shoulder has disappeared, though it is still present below 

 the shoulder. The ribbing below the shoulder is, however, weaker. 

 The tendency to form a shelly overgrowth is plainly seen. Though 

 its end is not w^ell marked, the cancellated stage comes to a close with 

 this whorl. 



Wliorl 9 — The spiny stage usually begins with this whorl. It is, 

 however, accompanied by well-developed senile features, the most 

 marked of wliich is the shelly overgrowth, which is produced by the 

 protrusion of the mantle on to the preceding whorl. 



Whorls 10, 11, 12 — Here we have simply an exaggeration of what 

 occurs in nine. The shelly overgrowth is extreme, obscuring the 

 ornamentation of several of the earlier whorls. The shell becomes 

 thick, the growth lines irregular, the anal siphon encroaches upward, 

 and the shoulder spines tend to pass into a shoulder keel. 



Remarks. — This is typically a senile race. No individuals of more 

 than eight whorls ever approach in their general appearance the V. 

 petrosus main stock. All specimens exhibit senile characters. These 

 latter are much more extreme than those found in the geologically

Hatchetigbee Bluff Race. 



Locality — Hatchetigbee Bluff, Tombigbee River, Ala. 



The series of young individuals at hand is so small, and the ghelly 

 overgrowth produced by the protruded mantle is so great in the old 

 individuals, that a detailed study of the specimens, whorl for whorl, 

 is not practical. 



These forms are extraordinarily senile, and have been derived from 

 the geologically earlier Wood's Bluff race by an exaggeration of the 

 senile features. The shoulder spines tend to pass into a shoulder 

 keel, the shell is thick, the growth lines irregular, the anal siphon 

 encroaches upward, and the preceding whorl is encumbered with the 

 shelly overgrowth. This last feature is very extreme. In addition 

 the race is, on the whole, a dwarfed race, the full-grown individuals 

 being smaller than those of the earlier less senile races. This race is 

 the end term of the senile offshoot which diverged from the V. petrosus 

 main stock in Bell's Landing time. The author knows of no authentic 

 abnormal senile specimen from beds higher than the Hatchetigbee 

 horizon in Alabama or Mississippi.^

Yellow Bluff Race. 



Locality — Yellow Bluff, Alabama River, Ala. 



Unfortunately the material at hand is not sufficiently well preserved 

 to give a detailed description, whorl for whorl. Nevertheless, there is 

 no difficulty in making out the following points. The great majority 

 of individuals possess, in general, the characters of the V. petrosus 

 main stock, and have arrived at little more than that evolutional 

 stage which is typified by the Gregg's Landing race. 



Though a few individuals exhibit senile characters, these latter are 

 only very slightly developed, and we are undoubtedly warranted in 

 placing the Yellow Bluff race on the Volutilithes petrosus main stock 

 as the descendant of the Gregg's Landing race. 



The exact stratigraphical horizon for this race is unknown to the 



'See Trans. Wag. Inst., Vol. Ill, part 1, p. 7.5. The statement made on this 

 page by Dall is not borne out by a study of full collections. He says that Athleta 

 "is foreshadowed by the distorted specimens of Volutilithes petrosa to which I 

 have already referred, and which occur from the Lower Eocene of Alabama 

 (Wood's Bluff) up to the Claiborne Sands and the beds known as Jackson, over- 

 lying the Claiborne, associated with the undistorted normal form, which is always 

 more numerous."

author. It cannot, however, be lower than that of the Bell's Landing 

 marl. If it is at the same horizon, we have an example of a slightly 

 senile race (the Bell's Landing) living at the same period of time not 

 far from a race (the Yellow Bluff) which exhibits, on the whole, main 

 stock characteristics. If, on the other hand, the Yellow Bluff race 

 occupies a position above the Bell's Landing marl, we have a primitive 

 race overlying a more specialized race. If this latter is the case, a 

 discordance between the geological and phylogentic successions has 

 been produced by the migration into the section of the Yellow Bluff 

 race.

Claiborne Race. 



Locality — Claiborne, Ala. 



Whorls 1, 2, 3 — Smooth and rounded. 



Whorl 4 — Early in four the curved rib stage appears. It is not well 

 marked, persisting for but a short time, and is soon followed by the 

 straight, tubercled ribs of the cancellated stage. The shoulder angle 

 soon develops. The suture and shoulder tubercles are of about the 

 same size. 



Wliorl 5 — Characterized by the cancellated stage and much as in 

 the latter part of four. Spirals not strong. Suture tubercle weakens, 

 shoulder tubercle becomes stronger. 



Whorl 6 — Characterized by the cancellated stage. The suture 

 tubercle and the ribbing above the shoulder are almost gone. Shoul- 

 der tubercle stronger. Ribbing below shoulder is weaker. 



Whorl 7 — The ribbing and the suture tubercles disappear, and the 

 shoulder tubercles develop into spines during this whorl. In other 

 words, we have the transition from the cancellated to the spiny stage. 



W^iorls 8, 9, 10— All characterized by the spiny stage, but individual 

 variation is great. Senile features do not appear. 



Remarks. — Occurs in the Claiborne Fossiliferous Sand. This race 

 exhibits in general the characters of the V. petrosus main stock, though 

 it is probably not the most typical expression of that stock as it existed 

 at the time of the Claiborne deposits. The most notable features are 

 the shortening of the curved rib stage and the acceleration of the spiny

 siderable individual variation. The curved rib and cancellated stages 

 are very short.

less they probably represent the curved rib stage and will be assigned 

 to it. They persist for only a short while and are followed by the tuber- 

 cled ribs of the cancellated stage. At first the svitiire tubercle is con- 

 siderably larger than the shoulder tubercle. A shoulder angle soon 

 develops, and by the end of the whorl the suture and shoulder tubercles 

 are about of the same size. 



Wliorls 3, 4 — Characterized by the cancellated stage and much as 

 in latter part of two. Changes however occur, for the ribbing above 

 the shoulder and the suture tubercles weaken, though the shoulder 

 tubercle becomes stronger. The spirals are not well marked. 



After whorl four great individual variation sets in. The cancellated 

 stage may persist through the sixth whorl. After this the individual 

 variation is still more marked. Many specimens pass through the 

 spiny stage, though it is considerably modified by the development of 

 numerous secondary spirals and riblets. In many specimens the 

 shoulder spines are long in a transverse direction and notched by several 

 spirals. Sometimes the whorl may be of a rounded shape, with the 

 spines blunt, weak and obscure. 



Reyyiarks. — Occurs in the Claiborne Fossiliferous Sand. This most 

 variable species has an apex very different from those of the other 

 forms considered in this paper. The smooth stage is nearly all con- 

 fined to the first whorl, which is extraordinarily large for Volutilithes. 

 By a careful study of its ontogeny it is plain, however, that this species 

 was derived by acceleration from the Claiborne race of V. petrosus, or 

 else from some form verj'' close to it. We are forced, then, to the con- 

 clusion that shells with rather different apices may sometimes be very 

 nearly related ; in spite of the fact that, as a rule, this condition pre- 

 cludes close affinity. Though this variable species may have given 

 rise to species and races of later age than the Claiborne, the writer has 

 no evidence to that effect. The anal siphon does not encroach up- 

 ward, and the protruded mantle smooths the preceding whorl but 

 little; nevertheless, the thickness of the shell and the irregularity of 

 growth lines in many of the older individuals point to the fact that it 

 is a senile race. It is well developed in the Claiborne horizon at several 

 points, where it is always variable and more numerous than the Clai- 

 borne race of V. petrosus. From this latter race it was probably 

 evolved during or just before Claiborne time, and may therefore be con- 

 sidered as a senile offshoot from the T^ petrosus main stock.

 irregular. The shelly smoothing of the preceding whorl by the pro- 

 truded mantle is only slight. This whorl is characterized by the senile 

 stage.

Remarks. — This race shows a regular and even ontogeny. The 

 different stages are quite distinct. The senile characters are not 

 thrown back into the spiny stage but follow regularlj^ after it, and 

 constitute the culminating feature of individual development. These 

 marks of old age are never extreme. Acceleration early in life has 

 placed the curved rib stage at the beginning of the third whorl, and 

 the cancellated stage has been correspondingly lengthened. The 

 cancellated stage is longer here than in any of the other forms con- 

 sidered in this paper except V. limopsis. This assemblage is the last 

 representative of Volutilithes in the Alabama and Mississippi Eocene. 

 It fulfills every requirement for position on the V. petrosus inain stem, 

 it is the culminant race of the stock, and has attained its characters 

 by a slow and even phylogenetic development.

Locality — Lisbon, Ala. 



Whorls 1, 2 — Smooth and rounded. 



Whorl 3 — Smooth and rounded at fii'st, but later the curved rib stage 

 begins. This persists for about a quarter of a whorl, and is then fol- 

 lowed by the straight, tubercled ribs of the cancellated stage. The 

 shoulder tubercle is just a trifle larger than the suture tubercle. The 

 shoulder angle is well marked by the end of the whorl. 



Wliorl 4 — Characterized by the cancellated stage. Shoulder angle. 

 Shoulder tubercle stronger than the suture tubercle. 



Whorls 5, 6 — Characterized by the cancellated stage and much like 

 whorl four. During these whorls the suture tubercle tends to attain 

 the same strength as the shoulder tubercle. Spirals not very well 

 marked. 



Whorl 7 — From here on the primitive cancellated stage is replaced 

 by what may be called a modified cancellated stage. The suture 

 and shoulder tubercles are now of about the same size. The ribs are 

 crowded so closely together that they are almost in contact, being 

 separated by a mere depressed line. The shoulder tubercles are so 

 close together that the general effect is that of a whorl with a shoulder 

 keel. 



Whorls 8, 9 — ]\Iuch as in seven, but toward the end the shell becomes 

 thick and the growth lines slightly irregular. The protruded mantle 

 produces only an insignificant smoothing of the preceding whorl. 



Remarks. — By a study of its early whorls it is evident that this form 

 was at some time derived from the V. petrosus main stock. Its can- 

 cellated stage closely resembles that of the races of V. petrosus until we 

 reach the seventh whorl. After that it is quite different in its general

characters from every other American species of Volutilithes. Just 

 when it diverged from the V. petrosus main stock the writer is not 

 prepared to say. This race has, properly speaking, no senile stage.

Range and Distribution. 



Of the forms considered in this paper Volutilitkes limopsis stands out 

 distinctly as fulfilling all the requirements of an ancestor. Among 

 other characters, the long smooth stage and the absence of senile fea- 

 tures show its primitive state. The general likeness of the full-grown 

 shells to the young of many later species, together with its low geo- 

 logical position, justifies us in considering it to be the form from which 

 were descended the races which followed Matthew's Landing time. 



In the same horizon with V. limopsis we find V. rugatus. The young 

 of the latter show many of the features of the adult V. limopsis, while 

 the old individuals are often slightly senile and quite different in ap- 

 pearance from the small specimens. It was undoubtedly derived from 

 V. limopsis, or some closely allied form, and may be considered a short 

 senile offshoot which did not survive the Matthew's Landing. 




72 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mai'Ch, 



In the Nanafalia the first member of the Volutilithes petrosus assem- 

 blage makes its appearance, and is representative of the V. petrosus 

 main stock. After the Nanafalia the races of V. petrosus are a promi- 

 nent feature of the faunas. Though the adults of these races may differ 

 greatly, the young resemble each other closely, and indicate their 

 common derivation from V. limopsis. 



In the Gregg's Landing marl, the Gregg's Landing race represents 

 the V. petrosus main stock, though a few of its individuals show slightly 

 senile tendencies. In the Bell's Landing marl the Bell's Landing race 

 has separated from the main stock with the evolution of senile features. 

 It is the first member of a senile offshoot which in later time produces 

 the Wood's Bluff and Hatchetigbee Bluff races. These latter are 

 evolved from the Bell's Landing race, not so much by an acceleration 

 as by an exaggeration of the marks of senility. The Hatchetigbee 

 Bluff race is without descendants and the last term of this senile series. 

 Its individuals are dwarfed and stunted, reflecting plainly the unfavor- 

 able conditions under which they lived, and which soon caused the 

 extinction of the race. 



While in some localities the members of the Volutilithes petrosus 

 assemblage were following out a line of evolution which resulted in 

 their elimination from the geological record, the main stock was still 

 flourishing in nearby regions. For instance, at Yellow Bluff on the 

 Alabama river we have a representative of the V. petrosus main stock. 

 The YeUow Bluff race is indicative of favorable conditions at that 

 locality. 



In the Lower Claiborne the V. petrosus main stock occurs, though it 

 is represented only by a few poorly preserved specimens. The Clai- 

 borne, however, not only gives us the Claiborne race but an offshoot 

 from it, namely, V. sayana. This Claiborne race is an assemblage of 

 rather accelerated and variable forms which probably express the 

 effect of shallow water marine conditions upon the main stock. By 

 an acceleration of ornamental features V. sayana was derived either 

 from the Claiborne race or from some very closely related form. 



Passing now into the Jackson, we find the last member of this phy- 

 logenetic series which we have traced up from the Matthew's Landing 

 horizon. It is the Jackson race of V. petrosus. This form is the result 

 of the slow and even evolution of the ancestral race which took place 

 in the favorable conditions of a more open sea. Its ontogeny is nor- 

 mal, each stage following its predecessor in regular fashion. Though 

 this form is accelerated, there is little mingling of the senile and spiny 

 characters by unequal acceleration. The senile stage closes a well- 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 73 



developed spiny stage. This race of V. petrosus differs but slightly 

 from the form which we saw in the Nanafalia beds, and demonstrates 

 clearly how little a stock may vary through a long period of time if it 

 is living under favorable conditions.^- 



The phylogeny of the Alabama and Mississippi species of Volutilithcs 

 may be represented by the table on p. 74. The Yellow Bluff race is 

 provisionally placed in the Bell's Landing horizon. 



Summary. 



From the Matthew's Landing to the Hatchetigbee inclusive the 

 strata belong to the so-called Lignitic formation. They consist of 

 thick deposits of cross-bedded sands and clays, often glauconitic, and 

 of lignites alternating with thin beds of marine fossils." It is evident 

 that these deposits were formed in a great shallow arm of the sea, 

 whose w^aters were sometimes fresh or blackish and at others salt. 



The marine faunas which from time to time invaded this Lignitic 

 gulf brought with them, at first, species and races of Volutilithes with 

 normal aspect. These, however, only represent the dwellers on the 

 edge of the respective Volutilithes communities, the centres of which 

 were farther out in the open sea. These forms which were subjected 

 to the conditions of the Lignitic eventually followed out a course of 

 evolution which was a direct reflection of their unfavorable environ- 

 ment. The races of Volutilithes petrosus at Bell's Landing, Wood's 

 Bluff, and Hatchetigbee Bluff make such a series, in which the 

 senility becomes more and more extreme with the course of time." 



Occasionally throughout the later Lignitic, as at Yellow Bluff, we 

 find a race which has migrated from a more favorable environment, 

 and which resembles the primitive races of earlier Lignitic waters, as 

 those of Gregg's Landing and Nanafalia. The grade of phylogenetic 

 development which the Yellow Bluff assemblage has attained also 



'^ The author has seen forms purporting to come from the Vicksburg horizon 

 which appear to be poorly preserved examples of the Jackson race of V. petrosus. 

 He does not, however, feel justified (without further evidence) in carrying the 

 range of V. petrosus above the Jackson horizon.

 Tombigbee, and Alabama Rivers," Eugene A. Smith and Lawrence C. Johnson. 



^* It is to be noted in this connection that forms occur in the Miocene of Europe 

 which appear to belong to Volutilithes and to possess the shelly overgrowth. 

 The abnormal American races are produced by local conditions, that is, by those 

 of the Lignitic, and are widely separated not only geographically but geologically 

 from the European specimens. It is therefore highly improbable that the Eu- 

 ropean forms (if they are Volutilithes at all) are descended from the American ones, 

 In the absence of more definite information, we are justified in regarding the 

 phenomenon as one of parallelism.

indicates that a normal, slow, and even evolution has been going on 

 in one locality ; while at the same time rapid, senile evolution has taken 

 place among forms subjected to unfavorable conditions in another 

 region. 



Where, then, was the centre of this normal phylogeny? We may 

 well look toward the open sea to find this favorable environment, and 

 the deposits which follow the Hatchetigbee beds furnish us with the 

 desired answer. 



With the inauguration of the Lower Claiborne began that movement 

 which finally resulted in the deepening of the sea and the production 

 of the white limestone of the Jackson. The brackish water conditions 

 disappear and are replaced by those of a shallow water (but typically 

 marine) environment. The Claiborne race of Volutilithes petrosus 

 shows the effect of such conditions upon the main stock. The sinking 

 of the sea-bottom proceeded throughout Claiborne time, and finally 

 the Jackson limestone with its relatively deep water fauna is intro- 

 duced. The Jackson race of V. petrosus represents the result upon the 

 main stock of slow and even evolution in a favorable environment. 



It follows, then, that every stock has some particular set of condi- 

 tions in which it develops normally. Contemporaneously with this 

 normal phylogeny a senile evolution in the same stock may occur at 

 some less favored locality. In the forms we have considered the 

 environment most favorable to a slow and even evolution is an open 

 sea one, in which limy deposits are forming. It is only, then, in a 

 thick limestone deposit that we could expect to find all the phyloge- 

 netic stages of the Volutilithes petrosus main stock and other primitive 

 species. In conclusion it is interesting to note that one of the only 

 two existing species of the genus, namely, Volutilithes abyssicola 

 Adams and Reeve,^^ is a cancellated form which apparently is quite 

 close in its grade of evolutional development to the ancestral V. limop- 

 sis of remote Eocene time. This recent species is found in relatively 

 deep water off the Cape of Good Hope, and probably is a member of 

 a primitive stock, which iri the favorable environment of a deep and 

 open sea has been able to persist long after its nearest relatives have 

 become extinct.^^

SOME COLD-BLOODED VERTEBRATES OF THE FLORIDA KEYS. 

 BY HENRY W. FOWLER. 



During June of 1904 the wi'iter, accompanied by Mr. Stewardson 

 Brown, of the Botanical Section of the Academy, was enabled through 

 the generosity of Mr. Clarence B. Moore to visit the Florida Keys. 

 The chief object of the expedition was to explore the islands for land 

 snails of the genus Liguus. Incidentally we were enabled to study the 

 flora and fauna of this most interesting region. We availed ourselves 

 of every opportunity to gather information, l^ut only data which I 

 feel to be absolutely reliable is here included. The vernacular names 

 of the different species, so far as I could judge, are those of the fisher- 

 men and residents. 



Our operations extended from between a point directly south of 

 Cape Sable, or from Grassy Key west to the Marquesas, covering an 

 area about fifty miles in length. We did not visit the Tortugas, which 

 are the most western of the Keys and more isolated than the Mar- 

 quesas. Making Key West our headquarters, we set out after explor- 

 ing that island for the IMarquesas, stopping at Boca Grande Key on 

 our way. The Marquesas bank comprises a number of islands, dis- 

 posed in a more or less circular or atoll-like manner with great shallows 

 all about, though mostly inside. Few places we visited repaid us as 

 well as these islands. On our return we skirted the southern shores 

 of the Keys toward Key West, stopping at Ballast Key. We then left 

 Key West again and travelled along the southern shores of the Keys 

 eastward to Grassy Key, stopping at Boca Chica, Sugar Loaf, Big Pine, 

 No Name, Cud joe's. Knight, Vaca and Grassy Keys. On our return, 

 which was along the northern shores of these islands, we stopped at 

 Vaca, Bahia Honda, Hailer's Rock, Little Pine, Big Pine, Summer- 

 land, Cudjoe's, Sugar Loaf, West Cudjoe's, Riding, Snipe and Jewfish 

 Kej^s, Most of the Keys are more or less covered with mangroves; 

 others, such as Big and Little Pine, have large tracts of pine forest with 

 an undergrowth of scattered palmettos. The latter grow several feet 

 in height, and in combination with the pines present a beautiful con- 

 trast after the monotony of mangroves. All of the islands are low, 

 rising but a few feet above the sea-level, and most all are furnished 




78 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Marcll, 



with rather broad white sandy beaches. Some places along these 

 beaches are studded with mangroves, affording excellent shelter, 

 when overhanging, for many fishes. Along a number of the Keys 

 w^ere flat embankments covered with long grass, and in other places 

 coconut groves, as that on Boca Chica Key. jNIany Keys were covered 

 with more fertile areas in which various tropical plants, shrubs and 

 trees were found in abundance, often studded here and there with 

 cacti, and sometimes presenting an impenetrable barrier. Throughout 

 the Keys we visited the water is comparatively shallow. In some 

 places reefs are formed where the most beautiful of tropical marine 

 animal life abounds in luxuriance. Most of these places, we were in- 

 formed, are constantly though gradually shifting, so that new charts 

 are needed from time to time to show the changes in depth and to- 

 pography. Some of the shallows are left entirely dry by the tides, and 

 others are covered with large beds of sea-wrack. In such places many 

 wading-birds find an abundant supply of food. We found a few pools 

 on certain of the larger Keys, such as Big Pine, Summerland and 

 Little Pine. They are of rather brackish-water, though I did not taste 

 of all. 



Hailer's Rock is a small flat or low island of sand-heaped rocks, with 

 a growth here and there of a few low bushes. The southern end is of 

 bare dry rocks running well out to sea and leaving numerous tide- 

 pools. These pools vary in size and depth from some of a few inches 

 in extent to others of several feet. Here such gaudj^ and tropical 

 fishes as the Cock Eye Pilot, Sheep's Head, Rock Fish, and School- 

 master were found. The Rock Fish, or Gobies and Blennies, are 

 colored much like their surroundings, and trust in great part to this 

 for concealment. Some are pale and others are dark. They dart 

 swiftly from place to place when disturbed, much after the manner of 

 our own Darters, or else hide in crevices. Though they were active, 

 I secured a number by hand with a little trouble. 



While off Key West we saw cetaceans, evidently a species of Del- 

 phinus. The Opossum and Raccoon were reported from Key West. 

 and the latter also from Sugar Loaf, Big and Little Pine Keys. I saw 

 a Rabbit on Big Pine Key and a Deer on Sugar Loaf. Deer were 

 found former!}' on Little Pine Key, but were now believed to be absent. 

 Though I did not see the Wood Rat on Summerland Key, I was in- 

 formed that they sometimes climb the trees to feed on fruits, such as 

 the sapadilla.

FISHES. 

 GINGLYMOSTOMID^. 



1. Ginglymostoma cirratum (Gmelin). Shark. 



Very abundant in all warm shallows about the Marquesas. At 

 this season (June) they come in these places to copulate, and I was 

 informed that they do not occur here, or at least were rarely seen, at 

 other times for this purpose. I saw a male and female in coitus. On 

 one occasion about four males were seen swimming close about a 

 female, whose whitish belly could be seen quite a distance, as she was 

 back down. She was also evidently awaiting their initiative. I 

 approached in a small boat till almost directly above, when it was 

 possible to prod them with an oar as they swam slowly about and 

 but little agitated. A pair will remain fastened together some little 

 time, and then suddenly part without much commotion. Their loca- 

 tion may easily be determined in these places by a portion of the dorsal 

 fin, and frequently also a part of the caudal, projecting above the 

 surface. The term "cooting," employed by some fishermen for the 

 act of copulation among these sharks, may possibly have been 

 derived from the word courting. 



Examples vary somewhat in color, some appearing pale cinnamon, 

 though they are always distinguishable quite a distance, even when 

 entirely under water. All I observed were large, nearly twelve or 

 fourteen feet in length, and were not at all shy. Occasionally in shal- 

 low water, especially like that along the southern shores of Ballast 

 Key, they were sometimes more or less exposed or with both caudal 

 fins well out of the water when copulating. 



ALOPIIDiE. 



2. Alopias vulpes (Gmelin). Fish Shark. 



Reported to be rather numerous at times in and about the Keys. 

 They were said to feed almost entirely on fish. 



GALEID^. 



(Galeus Klein, in Walbaum, Pet. Arted. Gen. Pise, III, 1792, p. 580. Type 

 Squalus galeus Linna'us = Galeorhinus Blainville, 1816-17.) 



3. Cynais canis (Mite hill). 



A small Shark was seen in the shallow water about Sugar Loaf Key. 



4. Galeocerdo tigrinus Miiller and Henle. 



Reported as sometimes taken during smnmer. 




80 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



5. Carcharliinus lamia (Rafinesque). 



Large examples of some species of Carcharhinus, most likely this 

 species, were reported under the name ''Man Eater." I did not see 

 any examples or hear any reports of Scoliodon terroe-novoe (Richard- 

 son), unless it was confounded with the present form. 



OESTRACIONTID^. 



(Cestracion Klein, in Walbaum, Pet. Arted. Gen. Pise, III, 1792, p. 580. 

 Type Sqimhis zygoejia Linnaeus = Sphyrna Rafinesque, 1810.) 



6. Cestracion tiburo (Linna?us). Bonnet Head Shark. 



Reported as rather abundant. 



7. Cestracion zygaena (Linnseus;. Hammer Head. Hammer Head Shark. 



The large examples which occur about Bahia Honda Key are said 

 to attain at least fifteen or more feet in length. C. tiburo is said to 

 be small. Both species were reported as more abundant in summer. 



RHINID^. 



(Rhina IQein, in Walbaum, Pet. Arted. Gen. Pise, III, 1792, p. 580. Type 

 Squalus squatina Linnaeus = Squatina Dumeril, 1806.) 



8. Rhina squatina (Linnwus). 



Occasionally taken in smnmer. 



PRISTID^. 



9. Pristis pectinatus Latham. Saw Fish. 



Reaches a considerable size. Young rather common in the shallows. 



NARCACIONTID^. 



{Narcadon Klein, in Walbaum, Pet. Arted. Gen. Pise, III, 1792, p. 580. 

 Type Raja torpedo Linnaeus = Narcobatus Blainville, 1816.) 



10. Tetronarce occidentalis (Storer). Electric Fish. 



Found occasionally associated with species of Dasybatus. 



DASYBATID^. 



{Dasybatus Klein, in Walbaum, Pet. Arted. Gen. Pise, III, 1792, p. 581. 

 Type Raja pastinaca Linnaeus = Dasyatis Rafinesque.) 



11. Dasybatus hastatus (DeKay). Stmg Ray. 



Color in life pale hair-brown above, margin of disk paler or more 

 or less narrowly whitish, and submarginally a slightly darker shade 

 than general color of body. Tail blackish-brown, spine dark. Lower 

 surface of body white. Iris brown. 



This species was seen several times about the shallows of the Mar- 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 81 



quesas. When swimming they appear to ghde over the sand, from 

 which they are distinguished with difficulty when quiet. They 

 usually swim rapidly away upon the approach of a small boat, though 

 we captured a single example with the harpoon. They were found in 

 pairs, and seldom attained more than a couple of feet in width 

 of disk. 



PS ALLISOSTOMID^ . 



{Psallisostomus Klein, in Walbaum, Pet. Arted. Gen. Pise, III, 1792, p. 

 581. Type Esox osse,us Linnaeus.) 



12. Psallisostomus osseus (Linnaeus). Common Gar. 



Reported from about the Keys south of Cape Sable, but not seen by 

 me. 



ELOPID^. 



13. Tarpon atlanticus (Valenciennes). Tarpon. 



This fish is reported to be used for food by the negroes at times. It 

 is the custom of anglers to throw their bodies on the beach or shore, 

 as it is said they attract the sharks if allowed to stay in the water, 

 thus interfering with the fishing. The young were said to be not 

 quite so common, though it is possible that they may have been over- 

 looked. 



14. Elops saurus Linnaeus. Ten Pounder. 



Said to be aljundant at times. 



ALBULIDiE. 



15. Albula vulpes (Linnaeus'. Bone Fish. 



Mostly abundant.

1 Drs. Jordan and Gilbert, in Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., V, 1SS2 (1883), p. 574, 

 have restricted Lacepede's genus Clupanodon to jussieui. Later Drs. Jordan 

 and Evermann, in Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., No. 47, 1, 1896, p. 422, apparently con- 

 sider pilchardus as typical. These precepts do not fall within the rule of elimina- 

 tion as the last name for which a generic name is proposed, so far as I can find, 

 is thrissa. For this Dr. Gill proposed Opisthonema. At any rate Sardinia cannot 

 be so considered as it is a synonym of Thrissa Rafinesque. Lacepede's species 

 thrissa may be considered restricted to the American Thread Herring, as the 

 Chinese fish included under Osbeck's reference is one of the Dorosomatidoe. Opis- 

 thonema Gill is thus to be superseded by Clupanodon Lacepede The True Sar- 

 dines formerly placed under the latter name, will stand as species of Thrissa 

 Rafinesque, with Clupea pilchardus Linnseus as the type. Messrs. Jordan and 

 Seal have pertinent remarks in Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., XXVIII, 1905 p. 771.

 Fins pale and more or less transparent. Iris silvery. 



Reaches a length of 3 inches. Found throughout the Keys, the 

 above notes from examples from Hailer's Rock. Very large schools 

 were seen both in this locality and about the Marquesas. They swim 

 in large shoals associated with the other small fishes, haunting the shal- 

 lower as well as the deeper places along shore. They were unusually 

 numerous about the broken rocky shores, where free ingress and egress 

 could be had with the outer waters. Here the schools were seen more 

 or less quiescent and with their heads all directed one way, so that 

 upon any disturbance the whole mass would move more or less as if 

 by one impulse. They appear mostly transparent in the water. I 

 found them occasionally in the siu"f , where they were probably more 

 abundant than I was able to determine. When taken from the water 

 they soon die. I never observed them in any tide-pools which were 

 cut off from the sea during low tide.

Found only at the above locality in company with A. hrownii. 

 Only these few were secured among the multitudes of the latter. 

 From A. chcerostoma (Goode), with which this form may prove iden- 

 tical, it appears at present to differ a little, upon comparison with 

 Porto Rican material, in the more elongate form, larger eye and head, 

 and more blunt or rounded snout. Young examples have a smaller 

 eye, nearly 4 in head.

SYNODONTID^. 



22. Synodus foetens (Liniifeus). Lizard Fish. 



Color in life clear pale brownish above with about 10 wampum-like 

 blotches of darker brown. In some examples this produces a pepper 

 and salt appearance. A slightly dark double series of blackish dots 

 across each blotch on back. On side just below back a series of zig- 

 zag W-shaped markings also of same darker color. Same color ac- 

 cents end of each blotch in form of a trifle darker speck. A somewhat 

 diamond-like blotch or ring between each median lateral marking and 

 somewhat connected. Another blotch alternately below each of 

 these, and still lower more paler tints of diffuse markings. A deep 

 brown blotch at base of tail and another of pale brown at base of each 

 lobe. Head brownish above, and variegated with deeper spots and 

 more or less olivaceous-golden on sides above. Jaws and mandible 

 variegated with olivaceous-brown. Iris golden-olive, in some lights

A number of small examples were taken in the sandy shallows of 

 the Marquesas. 



MURiBNID^.

 color. 



SILURID^. 



24. Galeichthys felis (Linnaus). Cat Fish. Salt Water Cat. 



Very abundant and a very foul feeder, eating any refuse or filth 

 thrown overboard. They were so ravenous that it was possible to 

 catch them on any kind of bait even on a bent pin. At times great 

 quantities were said to have been taken in seines, in which cases the 

 fishermen would cut the leads and floats, leaving the whole mass to 

 extricate themselves as best they may. Their spines are very much 

 dreaded by the fishermen, who claim they are able to produce 

 dangerous and ugly wounds. Most all the examples I observed were 

 about Big Pine Key.

 Lower surface of body white. Dorsal, anal and caudal grayish, former 

 with a well-defined pale base. An olive shade on opercle. Iris silvery, 

 a little brownish above and below, and latter also with a little pale 

 orange. Jaws pale. Length 3f inches.

were paler and had no spots on dorsal and caudal, and those on body 

 more yellowish. In spirits young examples show large blotches of 

 grayish on side and lack brilliant colors of the adults noted above. 

 They were more or less milky-white in life. 



This species is very abundant in pools and shallows of the Keys. 

 They were met with in great numbers all about the Marquesas, and in 

 the pools on Boca Chica Key. Young were abundant in the tide- 

 pools on West Cud joe's Key. Great numbers were also found about 

 Big Pine Key.

Tylosurus notatus (Poey). 



Found in small pools on some of the Keys. They usually associate 

 in small schools in the shallows or near the shore. When in the water 

 their bodies have a transparent appearance and in some lights are 

 difficult to distinguish. They are also fond of lurking about over- 

 hanging mangroves.

Abundant in the shallows near the shore where they associate in 

 large schools. When disturbed they rush away, causing a loud noise 

 in the water. Many were taken in cast-nets by fishermen, as many 

 as a dozen at one time. They average several pounds each, and I 

 found their flesh excellent eating. All examined appeared to be this 

 species. They were most abundant in the INIarquesas shallows.

 typhle, acus, pelagicus and ophidion, the second {acus) remains and therefore 

 must be regarded as the type. It is congeneric with Siphostoma Rafinesque. 

 For typle Rafinesque also prop^osed Typle, and for ophidion, Nerophis. The 

 latter name must therefore i-e used for the Ocean Pipe Fishes.

This species was reported not at all uncommon in the shallows of 

 the Marquesas about the Zostera, though I only found one example. 

 It is a very curious and interesting little animal and I watched it 

 inflate and collapse several times before death. The inflation was 

 slight, much less than that of Spheroides. This specimen agrees best 

 with the larger figure given by Drs. Evermann and Kendall,^ though 

 the dark reticulating lines are more distinct. Those on top of the head 

 are narrow, or fine, and others are broken a little. Those all over 

 abdomen are broader and darker.

 there is an evident small bluish shoulder-spot. 



Another example was brownish in life with a dull bluish tint, spots 

 more dull or pale bluish. Markings on back brownish. Fins brown- 

 ish, spots pale bluish. Outer portions of dorsal pale yellowish, bas- 

 ally spotted with pale bluish, and brownish between. Caudal same. 

 Anal paler bluish than on dorsal, becoming somewhat dilute brownish-

ing shelter in the crevices. They are colored much in keeping with 

 their surroundings, so that it is difficult to make out their presence 

 when quiet.

Color in life nearly uniform or pale isabella-color, finely dusted with 

 minute darker specks or dots. Eye slaty. 



Four examples from West Cud joe's Key were taken in the tide-

This species was found on the ground about shady hammock-land 

 on Boca Chica Key. I also saw one on a Gumbo Limbo tree on Vaca 

 Key. 



89. Hyla carolinensis (Pennant). 



A small green frog, evidently this species, was seen on Key West and 

 Boca Chica Key. 



REPTILES. 

 COLUBRID^. 



90. Natrix fasciata (Linntens). Moccasin. 



One example was taken in the mangroves of Boca Grande Key. 

 Here they live in the pools among the roots and short sprouts, and are 

 thus difficult to see on account of the seclusion afforded. I did not 

 meet with it in any other locality, though it doubtless occm-s as it 

 was reported from No Name Key. The vernacular is ''Moccasin," 

 as distinguished from the "Cotton Mouth Moccasin" (Agkistrodon 

 contortrix).

Reported from No Name Key. Seen on Knight and Summerland 

 Keys. 




110 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March,

 Cudjoe's Keys. 



OROTALID^. 



93. Crotalus adamanteus Beauvois. Rattler. Rattle Snake. Diamond Rattle Snake. 



Reported from Boca Chica, Big Pine and No Name Keys. I ob-

 was secured. 



SCINOID^. 



94. Eumeces fasciatus (Linnaeus). Lion. 



General color in life waxy-black. Lines on head and neck deep 

 brick-orange, becoming rather more orange on trunk, and finally fad- 

 ing into deep ultramarine-violet tail, though latter at first azure. 

 Line along side of head paler or more ochraceous. Lower surface of 

 head pale or translucent, mandible somewhat dilute purplish and 

 throat greenish. A tinge of pale brick-color on lower side of head. 

 Iris brownish. Lower surface of trunk dusky with brassy reflections. 

 Feet and legs black. 



This beautiful little lizard was first noticed in the hammock-land 

 on the east end of Boca Chica Key. They were also rather plentiful 

 on Vaca Key, where a rather large one was secured. 



TBID^. 



95. Cnemidophorus sexlineatus (Linnteus). Lagarto. Lion. 



In life upper surface brownish, and from above hind legs to tip of 

 tail grayish-brown. Lower sm-face entirely chalky or livid dilute 

 lavender-blue, inclining more to bluish laterally. A median pale 

 streak from occiput along upper sm-face of tail to become joined with 

 its fellows. They unite with a slightly ochraceous one on each side, 

 though becoming pale gray on tail, and extending parallel from occiput. 

 A bright yellow line similar in shape and course from above posterior 

 margin of eye and extending back along side of tail where it also be- 

 comes gray. From lower eyelid below another of pale lemon to hip 

 and fading out on femur. Still another, and paler, fading out on ribs 

 in front. It is indistinctly defined. Eyelid pale yellowish. Iris 

 brown. Lower side of head pale bluish. Top of head pale brown. 

 Inside of mouth flesh-colored. Upper surfaces of fore legs grayish- 

 brown. In sutures of sciuamation on posterior costal region, hind

legs, and front of tail, brick-colored patches. Lines fade out on tail 

 which is almost entirely gray a short distance from its base. A brown- 

 ish-gray line on posterior side of hind leg, leaving a white one between 

 it and color above. It extends along lower side of tail w^here it is blue- 

 green, and though continued a good distance back is not well defined. 

 Toes and soles of feet pale brownish flesh-color. 



Key West, Boca Chica, Big Pine, Knight, Vaca and Grassy Keys. 

 The above notes are from an example from the former locality. They 

 were abundant on most Keys, where they were seen running swiftly 

 through the grass. They soon hide in holes or among rocks. About 

 the lagoon on Key West I found them most common under low grassy 

 vegetation where numerous insects, such as small grasshoppers, were 

 seen. 



IGUANIDiE. 



96. Anolis principalis (Linnaus). Lion. 



Key West, Boca Chica, Marquesas, Big Pine, No Name, Vaca, 

 Grassy and Summerland Keys. Many bright green examples were 

 seen on Key West among grasses and other green vegetation, from 

 which they are distinguished with difficulty. Those on the ground, 

 or on brown sticks, etc., were brown in color. I never saw the animal 

 change to the negative of its surroundings. Thej^ are quick, though 

 more easily captured than the other species. 



CROCODILID^. 



97. Alligator mississippiensis (Daudin). Alligator. 



Reported from several pools we saw on Little Pine Key, thougli I 

 did not see any example during our stay. They were also reportefl 

 from pools on Summerland Key, and were said to occasionally reach 

 six feet in length. 



DERMOOHELYDID^ . 



98. Dermoclielys coriaoea (Vaiuk-lli). Trunk Back. 



Frequently taken about the Keys. Several shells were seen about 

 Key West. 



CHELONIID^. 



99. Thalassochelys caretta (Linnaeus). Logger Head Turtle. Logger Head. 



Reported as al^undant in the past and still frequently taken. It, 

 like both of the following species, is much sought after, and bids fair 

 to become exterminated in a short time if the ruthless depredations of 

 the turtle-fisher are not speedily checked. These animals, all of which 




112 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March. 



breed in suitable places in the Keys, are thus subjected to addi- 

 tional danger as their eggs are also held in demand. These are eagerly 

 gathered when found and used as food. 



100. Eretmochelys imbricata (Linnseus). Hawk's Bill Turtle. 



Shells of this animal were seen in Key West. It was reported as of 

 frequent occurrence in past times. 



101. Chelonia mydas (Llnnseus). Green Turtle. Turtle. 



Hunted for food and the most familiar of the family. Several 

 times newly laid eggs, most likely of this species, were found on the 

 sandy beaches of the different Keys. 



EMYDID^. 



102. Malaclemmys littoralis rhizophorarum subsp. nov. Terrapiu. Diamond Back Ter- 



rapin. Plate IV. 



Head large, heavy, flattened somewhat above, and below, and a 

 little swollen laterally behind each eye. Eye large. Snout short, 

 and rather obtuse. Jaws each with a broad horny covering. ]\Iouth 

 large, and its profile together with mandible convex. Legs and feet 

 strong, furnished with stout claws, five on each anterior limb and four 

 on each posterior. Claws on fore feet rather broad, and those on 

 hind feet narrow and longer. Scales on limbs well developed supe- 

 riorly. Tail short, conic, and rather weak. 



Carapace slightly ovoid when viewed from above, with its greatest 

 width opposite posterior portion of fourth vertebral plate. Anterior 

 carapace a little emarginate. Carapace deepest when viewed laterally 

 about middle of its length, or tops of crests of second and third verte- 

 bral plates highest with profile sloping down gradually in front and 

 behind. Lower margin of carapace sloping gently down to a point 

 above suture of seventh and eighth marginal plates, then turns up- 

 ward and outward a little to descend again behind. Vertical and 

 horizontal measurements of marginal plates forming bridge with 

 plastron, or fifth, sixth and seventh, about equal. Edges of marginal 

 plates from sixth backwards sharp and becoming more revolute to 

 most posterior. Axillary and inguinal plates well developed. Each 

 vertebral plate, except posterior which is evenly convex, with a 

 median keel surmounted by a more or less well developed osseous 

 tubercle posteriorly, and best developed proceeding to last. Each 

 plate of carapace with conspicuous concentric rings. Plastron a trifle 

 ovoid, and its greatest width would fall a trifle in advance of its middle 

 or about middle of bridge. Front of plastron nearly truncate or its 

 anterior edge only very slightly emarginate. Behind bridge sides of 

 plastron nearly parallel to posterior margin of femoral plate where 

 there is a prominent notch, and then more convergent to ends of anal 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 113 



plates which are furnished with a deep notch on median Une. Epider- 

 mal plates of plastron smooth. 



Color in life. Carapace deep dusky, with perhaps faint or obscure 

 darker mottlings. Inferior portion of marginal plates of carapace of 

 the same shade of pale yellowish-brown as the plastron, though at each 

 sutiu-e a broad blackish blotch. These blotches are most distinct and 

 conspicuous on the bridge, those of posterior plates very narrow. Plas- 

 tron dull or pale yellowish-brown, and articulation of each plate with 

 a broad irregular blackish margin, at least anteriorly. Head, legs, 

 feet and tail pale-slaty or plumbeous, and former speckled or spotted 

 with a dark or dusky-slaty. On legs this is evident as each scale has a 

 dark or slaty center. Jaws whitish or of a whitish horn-color. Top of 

 head pale or light. Eye grayish. Claws horn-color, dark or brownish 

 above. 



Length of carapace 7^ inches. 



Type, No. 16,570, A. N. S. P. Boca Grande Key, Florida. June 

 18, 1904. H. W. Fowler. Clarence B. Moore Collection. 



This form is known to me only from the above described example, 

 which was collected in a pool among the mangroves of Boca Grande 

 Key together with Natrix. It did not appear to me to be especially 

 abundant on the islands we visited, whether for seclusive habits or other 

 reasons, I could not tell. It was reported from other islands within 

 the limits of our trip, however. As it is highly valued as food it is 

 much sought after. Provisionally, as a form of Malaclemmys littoralis 

 of Prof. Hay,^ from the Texas coasts, it may be recognized as a distinct 

 subspecies. Although he had a very large series of individuals, the 

 sutures of the marginal plates of the carapace are not described as 

 black, which is the case in the example before me. His figures do not 

 show this, and certainly the colored one of the adult is different. I 

 have recently had the opportunity of examining a large series of several 

 hundred living examples of Malaclemmys centrata (Latreille), through 

 Dr. Samuel G. Dixon, in the markets of Philadelphia. Most of these 

 were said to have been procured near Savannah, Georgia. Great 

 variations in color were noticed, some individuals approaching the 

 above described example very closely, wdiile others had perfectly 

 uniform plastrons, etc. Most of the variations, like those figm-ed under 

 Emys concentrica by Sowerby and Lear,* were found.

116 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



This species is closely related to Scomber chloris Bloch, with which it 

 may possibly prove identical. However, that form, if the original 

 figure is to be trusted, is very close to Scomber chrysurus Linnaeus. 

 It will be seen to differ from C. chrysurus in the slightly deeper form, 

 larger eye, more anterior insertion of the anal, and longer pectoral. 

 The gill-rakers are about the same.

MOLLITSCA OF THE SOUTHWESTERN STATES. II. 

 BY H. A. PILSBRY AND J. H. FERRISS. 



The present paper deals with molliisks of Texas, New Mexico and 

 Arizona, collected chiefly by the authors in 1903, and not included in 

 the first paper of this series.^ No attempt has been made to present 

 complete faunas ; but in connection with the previous paper, about all 

 the reliable data extant upon the snail faunas of the Chiricahua and 

 Huachuca ranges in southeast Arizona and the eastern and southern 

 borders of the Lower Sonoran area in Texas will be found herein.^ 

 It has not been thought expedient to repeat data elsewhere accessible. 



For the student of molluscan distribution, the life zones of the United 

 States as mapped by Dr. Merriam ^ emphasize the secondary and not 

 the primary facts of distribution. The laws of temperatui'e control, 

 which he has developed with keen insight, do not define transcon- 

 tinental zones of primary import zoologically. These zones are sec- 

 ondary divisions of vertical life areas of which the molluscan faunas 

 were evolved in large part independently. The Sonoran fauna is 

 probably intermingling more now with that of eastern North America 

 than at any former time, at least so far as such sedentary forms as 

 land mollusks are concerned. 



Similar conclusions have been reached by Mr. A. E. Brown in deal- 

 ing with Texan reptiles.* The results of his study "establish three 

 facts, hitherto not wholly free from imcertainty : first, that the bound- 

 ary between the Austroriparian and Sonoran reptilian faunas lies ap- 

 proximately between the 96th and 98th meridians of longitude in 

 Texas; second, that the restricted Texan district of Cope is not Aus- 

 troriparian but Sonoran; third, that transcontinental zones of distribu- 

 tion cannot be maintained in the Medicolumbian region for reptiles. ' '

". . . . the community in reptiles between the Sonoran and the 

 Austroriparian is much less than that between the Sonoran and the 

 Central; it is, in fact, limited to widely ranging genera .... the 

 separate identity of these two faunas [Sonoran and Austroriparian], 

 as far back as they can be traced, confirms the conclusion already 

 reached, from their present distribution, that the association of the 

 Sonoran with the Austroriparian into one transcontinental zone is 

 unnatural." 



This terse statement only requires the substitution of ' ' mollusks ' ' 

 for "reptiles" to serve as a summary of the results of oiu- present in- 

 vestigation. In land mollusks, as in reptiles, the Sonoran types have 

 pushed farther into the humid Austroriparian than the eastern types 

 into the Sonoran area. Bulimulus and the texasiana group of Poly- 

 gyra are cases in point ; while Eastern subgenera of Polygyra, and prac- 

 tically all Austroriparian forms except the minute, widely ranging 

 genera, stop short at the rise marking the approximate limit of the 

 Cretaceous formation and the Sonoran area in Texas. The common 

 boundary of the Austroriparian and Sonoran, while surprisingly sharp 

 for continuous areas, is deeply accidented by the river valleys, which 

 carry very narrow Austroriparian ramifications into Sonoran borders. 

 Thus, along the San Marcos river in Hays county, the Guadalupe 

 river in Comal county, and the San Antonio river in Bexar county, 

 an Austroriparian fauna with such Eastern forms as Omphalina, Poly- 

 gyra thyroides, P. monodon fraterna, P. auriformis, P. roemeri, Bidimu- 

 lits d. liquahilis, etc., is found, while the fauna on the bluffs or away 

 from the streams is frankly Sonoran. Farther southwest, the Aus- 

 troriparian forms are wholly wanting, even where moist local condi- 

 tions prevail, as in the inunediate vicinity of the streams of Val Verde 

 county. 



A list of the forms characteristic of the eastern or lower portion of 

 the Sonoran in Texas (Texan District of Cope) follows :

Euglandina singleyana Potamopyrgus spinosus 



Bifidaria procera cristata Valvata micra 



Nine genera of this list are not known to occur in the Austro- 

 riparian or humid region of Texas. For list of the latter fauna, 

 the student is referred to the catalogue of Mr. J. A. Singley, cited below, 

 from which a long list of Austroriparian forms of Eastern type may 

 readily be compiled. 



The fii'st hst of Texan mollusks of any extent was published by 

 Romer in his excellent work on Texas, 1849. Numerous references 

 to the terrestrial mollusks will of course be found in Binney's successive 

 volumes. In 1878 Mr. A. G. Wetherby^ published some notes on the 

 forms he found in eastern Texas {American Naturalist for 1878, pp. 

 184, 254). The principal source of information, however, is Mr. J. A. 

 Singley's Contributions to the Natural History of Texas, part I, Texas 

 Mollusca, published in the Fourth Annvxil Rep. Geol. Survey of Texas, 

 1893. In this list Mr. Singley has included with the records of his 

 own extensive collecting, others from many sources, so that the records 

 are of unequal value. The Texan list stands much in need of revision 

 and a good many names thereon are doubtless to be rejected, either 

 because the forms do not occur in Texas, as in the case of Ampullaria, 

 or because of wrong identifications ; yet the work cannot be done until 

 resident naturalists take it up.

Fig. 1. Fig. 2. 



lished figm-es do not show that there is frequently a short lamellar 

 tooth or callous on the parietal wall near the suture, a short distance 

 within, as shown in the ^figured specimen from the Guadalupe river 

 near New Braunfels. 

 Thysanophora hornii (Gabb). 



Texas: Hondo river, near Hondo, Medina county; Rio San Filipe, 

 near Del Rio; Devil's river, west of Del Rio, and Pecos river at the

New Mexico: Florida mountains, near Deming, Grant county. 



Arizona: Cochise county; Cave creek canyon in the Chiricahua 

 mountains; Fort Bowie; drift of San Pedro river at Benson, and 

 Manilla mine, at the west end of the Huachuca mountains. 



This small species is a typical Thysanophora, closely related to the 

 type of the genus. It varies but little throughout its extensive range, 

 unless it be in the cuticular lines and hairs, which are worn off of the 

 river-drift specimens. It has not before been reported in this country 

 from east of Cook's, Grant county, N. M. Our collection of 1903 

 extended its known range in the United States more than 500 miles 

 eastward, to the border of the Staked Plains in central-southern 

 Texas. Further localities in Arizona are given in Nautilus, XII, p. 99. 



In Mexico, T. hornii has been collected at Topo Chico, near Mon- 

 terey, Nuevo Leon, and at Victoria, Tamaulipas {Proc. A. N. S. Phila., 

 1903, p. 763). It is therefore one of the widely distributed species of 

 the States both north and south of the international boundary in 

 the Sonoran area.

Austin and San Antonio (Pilsbry, 1885); along the Guadalupe river, 

 three or four miles above New Braunfels (Ferriss and Pilsbry). Sing- 

 ley adds the localities Bastrop and Burleson counties. It is an Austro- 

 riparian species which reaches into the borders of the Lower Sonoran 

 area along the river bottoms. 



While the identity of Wood's H. sayi with auriforfnis is not estab- 

 lished with sufficient certainty to make a substitution advisable, in 

 our opinion, yet there can be no doubt that Wood had either that 

 species or one of its immediate allies. Helix sayi of Binney, 1840, 

 being a homonym, may be changed to Polygyra sayana {Terrestrial 

 Mollusks, III, pi. XXIII). 



Polygyra hippocrepis (Pfr.)- Figs. 3, 4. 



The known range of this curious snail is exceedingly restricted. It 

 has been found only near New Braunfels, in Comal county, Texas. 

 We found it in abundance in April, 1903, on the west side of the 

 Guadalupe river about four to six miles north of New Braunfels, 

 under stones near and at the foot of the bluff, with Holospira goldfussi. 

 Another place much nearer the town is on the rocky wooded hillside 

 above the springs of Comal creek, where we found a few living ones. 

 This place is just beyond the pleasure gardens. 



Fig. 4. 



The structm-e of the aperture of P. hippocrepis has never been fully 

 described or figured. The parietal tooth is not V-shaped as in other 

 PolygjTas, but U-shaped, hence the name hippocrepis — horseshoe. 

 There is an internal tubercle on the columella, as in P. mooreana. The 

 upper and lower lip-teeth enter and arch towards each other, forming 

 a U-shaped curve, which stands close to but a little deeper than that 

 formed by the parietal tooth. Where the two entering teeth join 

 there is a notch and a delicate slender hook with the point curved 

 towards the adjacent basal wall projecting forward. The immersion 

 of the originally lower lip-tooth gives room for a secondary callous 

 ridge along the basal lip, as shown in fig. 4. 




128 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



These structures form in their way a more perfect barrier perhaps 

 than that produced by other means in P. auriculata and uvulifera. The 

 species stands isolated at present. It is perhaps an aberrant and 

 highly evolved relative of the Tennessee-Arkansas group of P. jack- 

 soni, etc. 

 Polygyra texasiana (Moricand). PI. V, flgs. 16, 17, 20. 



Specimens of typical P. texasiana were taken by us in Hays, Comal 

 and Bexar counties, Texas. Ferriss took it at Galveston. The type 

 locality is ''Texas." In this widespread form the last two whorls 

 are strongly rib-striate above, the riblets rapidly diminishing on pre- 

 ceding whorls ; the embryonic whorl is smooth and glossy. The ribs 

 are strongest just behind the lip, and here continue upon the periphery 

 or to the base, which is elsewhere nearly smooth or merely rippled. 

 Fresh shells show a reddish peripheral band on the pale brownish- 

 corneous surface. Specimens figured are from the west side of the 

 Guadalupe river above New Braunfels, Texas. Alt. 5, diam. 11 mm. 



Along the Rio Grande P. texasiana occurs with transition forms to 

 P. t. hyperolia. See below. 



Form with striate base. In some localities the ribs of the upper sur- 

 face continue upon the base (pi. V, figs. 18, 19, Calhoun county, Texas), 

 the other characters being unchanged. There are transitions to the 

 normal sculpture of texasiana in some specimens, and we do not think 

 it desirable to distinguish this form at present by a special name. Its 

 distribution must be more fully worked out than we have been able to 

 do. Calhoun county is on the Gulf coast near the southern angle of 

 the State. 



P. texasiana hyperolia n. subsp. PI. V, figs. 13 14, 15. 



Shell more depressed than texasiana, glossy, very finely striate, almost 

 smooth, above and below, with several riblets behind the lip-constriction. 

 Uniform brownish-corneous or paler beneath, without a peripheral haxid. 

 Aperture smaller and slightly more oblique than in texasiana. Alt. 4, 

 diam. 9.3 to 10 mm. 



The type locality is the high land west of Devil's river. This is the 

 common Polygyra along the Rio Grande in Val Verde county, extend- 

 ing north and northwest. The specimens from down the river, at 

 Hidalgo, .... county, and Laredo, Webb county (collected by 

 Singley), are either texasiana or transitional between texasiana and 

 hyperolia in sculpture. At Del Rio, along the Rio San Filipe, Ferriss 

 and I found still the texasiana and transition forms. 



On the high land west of the Devil's river, Val Verde county, we 

 found hyperolia in some numbers, under prostrate Yucca trunks and 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 129 



sometimes concealed in the shelter of the downward-drooping dead 

 leaves on standing Yuccas. From this region they have been washed 

 into the Devil's river, where bleached shells are abundantly found in 

 the drift debris. 



We also took specimens in the high land along the Pecos river, near 

 the High Bridge (Viaduct, on some maps), east of the river, and in 

 drift debris in the canyon. 



In the interior counties of Texas we took specimens in the drift of 

 the Hondo river, Medina county, about two miles north of Hondo. 



Much farther northward Mr. Ferriss found hyperolia at Colorado 

 City, Mitchell county, Texas. 



In New Mexico Prof. J. D. Tinsley collected it on South Spring 

 creek, near Roswell, in the Pecos valley, where it occurred fossil in a 

 bed of white marl, three to four feet below the surface. It is not now 

 found living in that locality. We are indebted to Prof. CockereU for 

 these specimens.'' 



P. t. hyperolia varies about as much as texasiana in size. Specimens 

 from west of Devil's river measure from 3.8x8 mm., with 4^ whorls, 

 to 4.2 X 11 mm., with 5 whorls. 



This variety is not the Helix {Poly gyro) tamaulipasensis of Lea, 

 which is typical P. texasiana, as I have ascertained by a comparison 

 of the type kindly made for me by Dr. W. H. Dall.

 mine whether it is really distinct enough from that subspecies to call 

 for recognition of the latter by name. In the large series of hyperolia 

 collected there were, however, no forins as large as texasensis.

any but the smallest texasiana, and with about the same number of 

 whorls (5 to 5^) appears more closely coiled. It is constantly dis- 

 tinct by the elongated columellar tubercle within the last whorl (shown 

 in fig. 9). This tubercle seems to be what Binney erroneously describes 

 as "an internal transverse tubercle on the base of the shell" — an ex- 

 pression which would lead one to expect such a structure as that 

 found in the Stenotremas. Binney states that the color is ''white," 

 but fresh shells are brownish-corneous, a little paler and somewhat 

 transparent at the base. The diameter varies from 6.5 to 8 mm. 

 Variation in the degree of elevation is shown in the figures. 



P. mooreana was originally described from Washington county, 

 Texas. We took specimens at Smithville, Bastrop county, San Mar- 

 cos, Hays county, around New Braunfels, Comal county (figs 4^7), 

 and on the Hondo river north of Hondo, Medina county (figs. 8, 9, 10), 

 ever3nvhere in copious quantity. There are also specimens before 

 us from Washington county, Belton, Fort Worth, Waco, Austin and 

 Lee county. Further records are given by Mr. Singley in his valuable 

 catalogue. It was taken at Galveston by Ferriss. 

 Polygyra mooreana tholus (W. G. Binn). PI. V, figs, l, 2, 3. 



Larger than mooreana, with the last whorl far more openly coiled 

 below, exposing more of the penultimate whorl in the much wider 

 umbilicus. Specimens from Washington county measure : 



Alt. 5.5, diam. 11, width of umbilicus 4.2 mm.; whorls 7. 



Alt. 4, diam. 8.2, width of umbilicus, 3 mm.; whorls 6. 



This form holds such a relation to P. mooreana as P. d. sampsoni to 

 P. dorjeuilliana, being very openly coiled beneath, with a deep and 

 very long groove on the last whorl within the umbilicus. The internal 

 ridge is like that of P. mooreana. It seems to be comparatively local in 

 distribution and is certainly rare. We have never seen a fresh specimen. 

 It was described from Washington county, Texas, the locality of the 

 specimens figured. It is in the collection of the Academy also from 

 Calhoun county. Ferriss took a few specimens at Galveston, and Sing- 

 ley found it in Fort Bend and Brazos counties. Von Martens reports 

 a worn specimen found by Fried el at Vera Cruz, Mexico.

BULIMULID^. 



The genus Bulimulus in Texas has caused much perplexity to stu- 

 dents. Many and diverse have been the views held as to the rank 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 131 



and identity of the several forms. Several times since the first visit 

 of one of us to Texas, in the winter of 1885-86, they have been carefully 

 studied anew, with each time larger materials and better knowledge 

 of the country. To the specimens already in the museum of the 

 Academy about 1,000 were added by our expedition of 1903, from 

 central and western Texas and Indian Territory. 



The series is divisible into two species, B. dealhatus and B. alternatus 

 marioe; the first further split into numerous local races or subspecies. 

 The typical forms of B. alternatus and B. schiedeanus do not, so far 

 as we know, extend into Texan territory; both were described from 

 Mexico where they range over a large area. B. patriarcha W. G. B., 

 unquestionably a form of schiedeanus, was also described from Mexico 

 (Buena Vista), and we have seen no specimen of it from within our 

 borders.^ 



In the United States, Bulimulus has not been found west of the 

 neighborhood of El Paso. We know^ nothing of what forms live in 

 the State northwest of a line from Austin to San Antonio, or north of 

 the Southern Pacific Railroad from San Antonio westward to El Paso. 

 Beyond some extension of the ranges of B. dealhatus mooreanus and 

 B. alternatus marioe, little is to be expected from the great unknown 

 area. 



The following forms are now recognized : 



1. B. dealhatus mooreanus W. G. B., Pfr. Arid region of central and 



south Texas. 



2. B. d. liquahilis Rve. Eastern and southeastern Texas. 



3. B. dealhatus Ssiy. Alabama to Kentucky, west to Kansas. 



4. B. d. ozarkensis P. and F. Northern and western borders of the 



Ozark uplift. 



5. B. d. ragsdalei Pilsbry. Bluffs of Red river and southwestern 



Texas. 



6. B. d. pecosensis P. and F. Southwestern Texas. 



7. B. d. pasonis Pilsbry. El Paso, western Texas. 



8. B. alternatus marioe (Albers). Southern Texas. 



Of these forms, the anatomy of B. d. mooreanus, B. d. liquahilis, 

 B. d. ragsdalei, B. d. pecosensis and the Val Verde county race of B. 

 alternatus marioe has been examined more or less fully. All agree in 

 having a rather short, fusiform penis with a basal sheath which in- 



* We do not mean to deny that the forms mentioned occur in Texas. The coun- 

 ties along the Rio Grande west of the mouth of the Pecos are still unexplored for 

 shells, and B. schiedeanus especially may turn up in this region.

eludes the vas deferens; a rather long and slender epiphallus, and a 

 flagellum. An atrium can scarcely be said to be developed, but the 

 vagina is rather long in all the forms. The globular spermatheca is 

 borne on a long duct, which is lightly bound to the oviduct and is

B. a. marice differs strongly from all forms of B. dealbatus by the 

 great length of the penis with its appendages, and of the duct of the 

 spermatheca. Moreover, the penial organs are longer than the 

 spermathecal duct, while in mooreanus and pecosensis the spermathecal 

 duct is the longer. These differences confirm the opinion, derived

in characters, and easily recognized. It is the only Bulimulus found 

 in the greater part of the region it inhabits, and is one of the com- 

 monest forms in collections. 



The specimens seen from Fort Worth are not unlike those referred 

 to B. d. liquabilis from Waco, and it is not easy to decide upon which 

 race they belong to. They are undifferentiated forms. 



In Comal, Guadalupe, Bexar and Medina counties we found only 

 typical mooreanus. In Frio county the shells are somewhat more 

 solid and often whiter. In a series of 313 specimens from along the 

 Guadalupe river above New Braunfels (pi. VI, figs. 2, 3, 4) I could 

 find but one shell with any of the ragged stripes of B. d. liquabilis. 

 In 165 taken along the river below San Antonio (pi. VI, fig. 1) there 

 were 7 with some ragged stripes, at least on the upper whorls. A 

 series of 55 mooreanus from Victoria had 4 striped shells (pi. VI, figs. 

 5, 6). The percentage of intergrading specimens is therefore small.

 Bulimulus schiedeanus Pfr., W. G. Binney, Terr. Moll., V, p. 391, fig. 276, but 

 not the description. 



The shell is thin, variable in shape but usually obese, the aperture 

 half the total length or more. Translucent-corneous or brownish- 

 corneous, more or less profusely marked with opaque whitish ragged 

 streaks. Interior whitish or colored like the outside. 



This is the form of the humid Austroriparian zone in Texas, as B. d. 

 mooreanus is of the arid division. Specimens are before us from the 

 following counties: Dallas, McLennan, Coryell, Bell, Travis, Lee, Hays, 

 Jackson, Nueces. Also from Limestone Gap, Indian Territory. 



Where the range of liquabilis adjoins that of mooreanus there is a 

 belt of overlapping ; but so far as we know the two do not actually occur 

 together. At San Marcos, Hays county, for instance, B. d. liquabilis 

 lives on the moist low alluvium along the San Marcos river, while B. 

 d. mooreanus is found on the Cretaceous limestone hills above the town. 

 It seems that the one form extends finger-like up some of the streams, 

 while the other may occupy intervening upland or calcareous stations. 



B. liquabilis and B. confinis were both described from "Texas." 



B. d. liquxibilis differs from mooreanus by the predominance of 

 corneous-brown coloring. It is also usually more globose and less 

 smooth. It is more globose than B. dealbatus, with less convex 

 whorls, as a general rule, yet there seems to be practically complete 

 intergradation between the races, and some Texas shells are not dis-

tinguishable from those of Alabama, though most others could not 

 be matched from east of the Mississippi. On the whole, the race 

 has intimate relations to those east and west of it, yet seems in its 

 own area to be sufficiently differentiated to be recognized. 



Specimens from Jackson county (collected by J. D. Mitchell) are 

 typical of liquahilis. They are small (pi. VI, figs. 9, 10, 11), well striped 

 as usual, variable in the length of the spire, and generally have a strong, 

 narrow lip-rib. 



ram. 



Shells from Lee county (J. A. Singley), are larger, more globose, cor- 

 responding to Reeve's B. confinis. The corneous-brown tint largely 

 predominates over the reduced whitish streaks. Lip-rib present in 

 adults (pi. VI, fig. 12). 



Waco specimens mostly have the spire longer, as do those from 

 Belton, Austin and San Marcos. In the series from the latter locality 

 (Ferriss and Pilsbry, 1903) there are about equal numbers of typical 

 striped shells and nearly unicolored corneous-brown ones, with indis- 

 tinct whitish streaks alternating with pale reddish on the spire (pi. 

 VI, figs. 7, 8). They measure: 



The genitaha of one of the unicolored shells are figured (fig. B). 

 The individual supplying the preparation was that shown in fig. 7 of 

 plate VI. Fig. 8 of the plate, a streaked shell, was found similar 

 anatomically. Judging by these shells, the race liquahilis is quite 

 appreciably different from mooreanus in the proportions of the geni- 

 talia. 



Some specimens from Limestone Gap, Indian Territory, evidently 

 belong to this race. 




136 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March' 



The shells figured by Binney as B. schiedeanus {Manual of American 

 Land Shells, p. 399, fig. 437) are apparently B. d. liquobilis. They are 

 certainly not the true schiedeanus, of which figures may be found in 

 the Manual of Conchology. 

 Bulimulus dealbatus (Say). Pl.VI, fig. 13. 



Helix dealbata Say, Journ. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., II, p. 159, 1821. 



Say gave the localities "Missouri and Alabama." His specimens 

 in the Academy Museiun are labelled Alabama. One of these three, 

 agreeing with the dimensions given by him, is figured (pi. VI, fig. 13), 

 as the type of the species. The Alabama form has a globose last whorl 

 and rather large umbUicus. The aperture is a little more than half 

 the total length of the shell, but much less than the diameter of the 

 shell. The shell is profusely striped with ragged white stripes on a pale 

 brownish ground. The type measures, alt. 19.4, diam. 12.2, length of 

 aperture 10.6 mm. 



The same form occm-s in Tennessee, Kentucky (Warren county), 

 and west to Kansas (Shawnee county). Some specimens from the 

 humid portion of Texas also seem to belong here.

B. dealbatus Say, Pilsbry, Proc. A. N. S. Phila., 1903, p. 204 (Seligman, Mo.). 



On the northern and western borders of the Ozark uplift this form 

 has been differentiated. The whole shell, and especially the last 

 whorl, is narrower, the aperture is smaDer, ordinarily half the total 

 length or less, and the umbilicus is narrower. The shape is about that 

 of B. d. ragsdalei, but the last whorl is not rib-striate, though the 

 spire is weakly so. Coloration as in dealbatus. Specimens measure:

While only weakly ciiaracterized, this form seems to range over a 

 considerable area, and apparently deserves recognition by name. 

 B. dealbatus ragsdalei (Pils ). PI. VI, flgs. 16, 17. 



Nautilus, III, p. 122; Man. of Conch., XI, p. 129. 



The shell varies from the ovate shape of typical dealbatus to a more 

 lengthened and slender form, and is conspicuously rib-striate, the striae 

 white on a tawny or white-blotched ground and weaker on the base of 

 the shell. The lip-rib is strongly developed. Three adult specimens 

 of the type lot measure: 



Only dead, more or less bleached shells have been taken from the 

 top of the Red river bluff at the southern end of Warren's Bend, 

 twenty-five miles northwest of Gainesville, Cooke county, and a mile 

 north of St. Jo, Montague county, Texas. 



Across the whole State of Texas nearly 400 miles distant, this form 

 reappears on the Rio Grande river, in Val Verde county, in an area 

 inhabited also by B. alternatus marice. We are quite unable to find any 

 constant differences between these Southwestern shells and the Red 

 river types, although the apparent absence of the form in the inter- 

 vening territory suggests that the similar forms of the two areas are 

 independent parallel modifications of dealbatus stocks, rather than 

 actually connected genetically. Yet it is quite possible that the 

 widely sundered colonies have been or still are connected through 

 the great conchologically unknown area northwest of the oblique line 

 across the State marking the limit of our explorations. Dead, bleached 

 shells were found in abundance on the high land west of Devil's 

 river, but the living ones for some time eluded us. Finally we found 

 them hidden under the dead reversed leaves which thatch the trunks 

 of Yuccas, and sometimes under prostrate dead Yuccas — retreats they 

 share with the smooth race of Polygyra texasiana (pi. VI, figs. 18 to 

 22). The proportions vary a good deal, a series of adult shells 

 measuring : 



17 mm.

138 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



The average size of 78 living shells is about 19 x 9 to 10 mm. Fig. 

 18 represents the largest shell taken, a dead one 26.5 mm. long. There 

 is but little variation in sculpture among shells from this place. 



Along the Rio San Filipe, not far from the Rio Grande, in chapparal 

 on the east side, we found numerous specimens differing from those 

 of Devil's river by having the rib-striae nearly obsolete on the last 

 whorl except just below the suture. A large number of dead shells 

 were found, but only very few living ones (pi. VI, figs. 23, 24). They 

 have the dull reddish, white-streaked coloration and the shape of the 

 Devil's river ragsdalei.

B. d. schiedeanus var., Pilsbry, Man. of Conch., XI, p. 132, pi. 17, fig. 6. 

 The shell is conspicuously calcareous, whitish with some fleshy or 

 sometimes corneous or ochraceous streaks ; upper whorls striate, the 

 last somewhat roughened by irregular growth- wrinkles. Spire long, 

 composed of numerous short convex whorls, the suture nearly hori- 

 zontal; apex white or pale; aperture small, usually ochre-tinted in 

 the throat, lip strengthened by a rib within. 



T)rpe locality, on the mesa about 1^ miles southeast of the eastern 

 end of the High Bridge of the Pecos (Southern Pacific Railroad), Val 

 Verde county, Texas. We found one small colony of this form, in the 

 midst of the large dark-mouthed B. alternatus marioe, and like that 

 chiefly living on Agave. The extent of the colony was perhaps not 

 more than 50 yards, but as the sun had already set, and we had just 

 emerged from the labyrinthine side canyons of the Pecos, we had 

 time to collect only about thirty-five specimens, each, most of them 

 dead. Everywhere else in the region around the High Bridge we 

 found only B. a. marice. 



This form is clearly a stunted race of the larger and less slender 

 B. schiedeanus of the Mexican fauna. B. schiedeanus has been con- 

 sidered specifically distinct from dealbatus by Binney and all the older 

 authorities, as well as by von Martens, who gives a series of good 

 figures in the Biologia Centrali Americana; but while the typical 

 schiedeanus is distinct enough, there are not lacking specimeiLs sug- 

 gesting intergradation with some forms of dealbatus. If schiedeanus 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 139 



be retained as a distinct species, then tl^e race pecosensis will be rele- 

 gated to it as a variety. 



Some specimens of pecosensis taken about thirty years ago by Dr. 

 H. C. Wood, probably, as he informs' me, from somewhere in the 

 "Great Bend" of the Rio Grande, were noticed in the Manual of 

 Conchology, Vol. XI. 



Bulimulus dealbatus pasonis Pils. PI. VI, flg. 25 

 Pilsbry, Nautilus, XVI, July 1902, p. 32. 

 The shell is smaller and more slender than any other form of deal- 

 batus, the diameter about half, the aperture less than half the total 

 length of the shell; nearly smooth, being sculptured with irregular 

 growth-wrinkles only. The dead specimens are dull reddish-corneous 

 with some streaks and mottling of opaque white. Wliorls 5f to 6, 

 quite convex. Aperture small, ovate, the insertions of the lip and 

 columella markedly approaching, without an internal lip-rib in the 

 specimens seen. Umbilicus comparatively large.

 This is the most distinct, as it is the most remote, of the races of B. 

 dealbatus, and unless connecting forms come to light, it may well be 

 given specific rank. The absence of regular striation on the spire, 

 the converging ends of the lip and the diminutive size combine to give 

 it individuality. As yet but few specimens have been found, and in 

 a single place. Some individuals of the Val Verde county B. d. 

 ragsdalei approach pasonis in size, but in a series of about 200 examined 

 none approach the other characters of the present race.

This species is recognized by its dense, solid, calcareous texture, 

 oblong shape and colored, usually dark brown or purplish interior, 

 and by the great length of the penis and spermathecal duct. Its range 

 extends in a wide belt along the Rio Grande, from the Gulf at least to 

 the Pecos river. How much farther west we do not know. 



B. marioe was named by Albers for his daughter Mary, having been 

 recognized as distinct on her birthday. The type, figured by Pfeiffer, 

 is a ragged-striped shell with only a low prominence, hardly to be called

 at Laredo, Webb county, on the Rio Grande (pi. VII, fig. 28). 



In a general way, the eastern (typical) form of marice from Frio 

 county and Laredo eastward differs from the western (Val Verde 

 county) form in several respects: 



Southeastern Form. Western Form. 



Smaller, more oblong; lip more Larger, more conic; lip less thick- 

 thickened; columella frequent- ened within; no columellar

 lines of figures. figures. 



We do not think it advisable at present to make a subspecifie separa- 

 tion, especially since none of the names proposed apply to the western 

 race. The genitalia of this race are figured (fig. A). 



While almost every colony of the eastern race has slight peculiarities 

 in shape, relative abundance or absence of the several color-forms, etc., 

 yet with large series the intergradation is seen to be so complete that 

 we can find no ground for dividing them into several races, as Prof, 

 CockereU proposes. His plan {Journal de Conchyliologie, 1891, pp. 23, 

 24) is as follows : 



1, With gray or brownish markings: 



a. Without a columellar tooth, alternatus Say. 



b. Columellar tooth present, marice Alb. 



2, Without color markings : 



a. With no columellar tooth, alhidus Taylor, 



6. A columellar tooth, . . hinneyanus Pfr. MS. W. G. B. [ = in- 

 termedius Singh, Ckll., Corpus Christi.] 



The true B. alternatus (type in coll. A. N. S.) has not been found 

 north of the Rio Grande, and in aU probability does not reach our 

 limits. The name hinneyanus is preoccupied, so that were the race 

 valid, we should use for that form the name intermedius SingleyMS. 

 CkU., based on Corpus Christi shells. The type locality of alhidus 

 Taylor MS. Ckll. is Derby, Frio county, Texas. 



Many perfectly adult Corpus Christi shells have no columellar tooth, 

 and hence we should have to divide them between intermedius and 

 alhidus. Similarly, various specimens selected from the Derby, Frio 

 county, series before me would be either alternatus, alhidus or inter- 

 medius; while from the Hidalgo series, all four of the supposed varieties 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 141 



may be selected. The study of good series of shells taken at random 

 and not selected shows that all lots of streaked shells are more or less 

 mingled with white ones, and in colonies of toothed shells, fully adult 

 and old individuals may be found without a tooth. On the other hand 

 there seem, however, to be colonies without ragged-streaked individuals, 

 and also communities in which no toothed shells are to be found. 



Perhaps the colonies containing mottle-streaked or toothed individ- 

 uals are mixed or hybrid communities. It is a case where experiments 

 on Mendelian lines by some one on the ground might be productive of 

 valuable results. 



In illustration of the foregoing remarks, a few of the colonies repre- 

 sented in the collection of the Academy may be noticed in more detail. 

 In studying these races it is absolutely essential that the snails be col- 

 lected alive. The colors, particularly of the interior, are evanescent

Corpus Christi, Nueces county (pi. VII, figs. 13, 14, 15, 16), collected 

 by J. A. Singley. Of thick-set compact contour, strong, with a thick 

 cream-tinted lip-rib, which is sometimes brown stained. Pinkish 

 white, almost uniform with some very inconspicuous grayish or fleshy 

 streaks. Not one in a lot of 43 is marked with hrown streaks outside. 

 Interior varying from pale yellow to reddish brown, the darker tint 

 exceptional. Columella varying from strongly toothed to nearly 

 straight. Whorls 6, the earliest post-embryonic not distinctly striated.

At Derby, Frio county (pi. VII, figs. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24), the shells are 

 bluish white with bluish streaks, a few brown tinted with brown 

 streaks. The columellar tooth is small or wanting. This form has 

 been called albidus Taylor, Ckll. 



At Laredo, Webb county (pi. VII, lower line of figs.), the shells are 

 large and mostly long. The lot consists of pm-e white, and of coffee- 

 tinted, brown-streaked shells, with all intermediate forms. A colu- 

 mellar tooth is exceptionally developed. 



At Del Rio, Val Verde county (pi. VII, figs. 9, 10, 11, 12), we found a 

 more conic i^ce. The shells are white, often with some very faint 

 grayish streaks. Interior varying from ochre-yellow to dark brown. 

 In the series of about sixty living shells before us, none has mottled 

 markings, and while in a few there is a weak indication of the colu- 

 mellar tooth, it is as a rule absent. The larger ones measure 29 to 33 

 mm. long, 16 wide. Some of the dead shells found in the same place 

 are larger, 35 x 18.5 to 37 x 17 mm. A single albino was taken alive 

 (fig. 12). These shells are from the plain along the San Fihpe river, 

 on the east side, not far from the Rio Grande. B. d. ragsdalei was 

 found in the same place. 



On the mesa west of Devil's river we found large dead shells like those 

 from Del Rio but even larger, often with a low lump on the parietal 

 wall, but no tooth on the columella. 39 x 20.5 to 35 x 16 mm. 



At the Pecos High Bridge, on agaves, north of the railroad near the 

 eastern end of the bridge, we found Bidimulus abundant and finely 

 developed (pi. VII, figs. 1 to 7). The shape varies, but is always more 

 conic than in the eastern localities. It is either nearly uniform white, 

 or coffee-tinted varied with oblique brown or purplish streaks; these 

 two color-forms in about equal numbers, found together on the same 

 plants and connected by intermediate examples. Apex white. The 

 interior is very dark purple-brown. The outer lip is usually but little 

 thickened within, and the columella has no tooth, though often it 

 is slightly salient in the middle. Whorls 7 to 7^.

 distance. Mr. Singley also found one specimen at or near the same

Subgenus CH^NAXIS nov. 



The shell has a large hollow axis, open below, and about one- third 

 the total diameter of the shell, the structure otherwise being like 

 Bifidaria s. str. ; peristome continuous and free. Type, B. tuba. 



The Bolivian Infundibular ia infundibuliformis (Orb.)^ resembles B. 

 iuha in having a very large umbilicus, and we at first thought to asso- 

 ciate the Arizonian species with it; but Infundibularia differs by the 

 strictly conic shell, and in the aperture, which shows but one lamella, 

 a very large angulo-parietal. Other lamellae or plicae, if they exist, 

 must be very deeply immersed, as in the group Immersidens. 



The type of d'Orbigny's species has been lost, and its internal 

 structure is unknown. It was found with Bifidaria nodosaria (Orb.), 

 :a minute species, imperfectly described and figured, but probably not 

 distinct from B. -pelludda (Pfr.). 

 Bifidaria tuba n. sp. Fig. 6. 



Shell cylindric with a short apical cone, openly umbilicate, the um- 

 bilicus nearly one-third the diameter of the shell, penetrating well- 

 like to the apex. Pale brown, smooth, with light growth-lines only. 

 Whorls 5^^, convex, the apex obtuse; last three whorls forming the 

 cylindrical part of the shell. The last whorl is compressed around the 

 umbilicus, and scarcely straightened in front. The aperture is short- 

 oval, the peristome continuous, thin and well expanded. The angular 

 and parietal lamellae are combined into one long lamella, notched on 

 the summit; where the two join, the inner end of the angular projects 

 a little on the right side. The columellar lamella is massive, slightly 

 bifid, deeply placed, and enters about as deeply as the parietal. 

 There are small, short, upper and lower palatal and basal folds, in the 

 typical positions, a short distance within the lip, usually with a minute 

 denticle between them, and another at the base.

single immature specimen was taken by Rev. E. H. Ashmun in drift 



of the Salt river, at Tempe, Arizona. 

 Remarkable for its ample umbilicus. The freshest specimens are 

 about the color of Pupoides marginatus. None 

 were taken alive. In the adult shell opened 

 (fig. 6) the parietal and columellar lamellae do 

 not enter deeply, though they go so far that the 

 inner end cannot be seen in the mouth. One 

 l^roken shell from Tempe, taken by Mr. Ashmun, 

 and which has been in coll. A. N. S. P. for some 

 years, has a strong lamella on the columella, ap- 

 parently at least a half-whorl long, but not pene- 

 trating much farther than fig. 7 shows. This 

 lamella may perhaps be developed during the 

 latter part of the neanic stage, to be resor]:)ed 

 in the fully adult condition. Further material 



is needed to demonstrate this. It is possible that the Tempe shell 



represents a distinct species. It tapers slightly more than the types 



from Benson.

Strobilops labyrinthica texasiana n. subsp. 



Shell moderately elevated with dome-shaped spire, brown, whorls 

 5^, the first 1^ smooth, pale-corneous, the rest regularly ribbed 

 obliquel^^ the last whorl rounded periplierally or a trifle and obtusely 

 subangular in front, the riblets passing over undiminished upon the 

 base, which is as strongly sculptured as the upper surface (or sometimes 

 smoothish just in front of the aperture). Aperture with expanded, 

 thickened peristome and strong parietal callus, a single strong parietal 

 lamella emerging to the edge of the callus, a second weak one visible 

 within. About half a whorl inw^ard there is a series of about six laminae, 

 the inner one upon the columella, the next short, strong and tongue- 

 shaped, bending outward; the third nearly twice as long, high and 

 sinuous; the fourth very minute and low, often wanting, leaving a 

 space; the fifth and sixth long and low; and just above the periphery 

 on the outer wall a very weak, low, long seventh plica may usually be 

 traced. Umbilicus rather large. 



Alt. 1.5, diam. 2.2 mm. 



Types No. 91,330 A. N. S. Phila., from drift of the Guadalupe

 Marcos (Pilsbry and Ferriss), New Braunfels (Ferriss, Pilsbry and Sing- 

 ley), Guadalupe river bottom, Victoria county, and Lavaca river, 

 Jackson county (J. D. Mitchell), Lee county (Singley), Calhoun county 

 (E. W. Hubbard), Gainesville (J. B. Quintard). A smaller form, diam. 

 2 mm., was taken in drift debris of the Hondo river about two miles 

 north of Hondo, Medina county (Ferriss and Pilsbry). It also ranges 

 northward into Indian Territory and to Kansas. 




148 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



This form, which for the present we subordinate to the old S. laby- 

 rinthica, is the only Strohilops except S. hubbardi which I have seen 

 from Texas. It may be distinguished from *S. virgo by the costulate 

 base, wider umbilicus and far weaker inner parietal lamella. S. 

 strebeli is a much more depressed cone. 



The statement by Woodward,^" copied into American works, that 

 H. labyrinthica occurs in pretertiary Eiuropean strata, is misleading, 

 since the American species is really not identical with any from Euro- 

 pean strata, though there are numerous allied forms in the European 

 tertiaries. The genus became extinct in Europe, but survives in China, 

 Helix diodontina Heude being a Strobilops. In America it has not been 

 found in the Northwest or Pacific States, but extends south to Mexico, 

 the West Indies and Venezuela, and a species apparently belonging to 

 the genus has been described from the Galapagos.

COOHLIOOPIDiE. 



Shell oblong, cylindric-oblong or narrowly tapering, smooth and 

 glossy, with imperforate axis ; aperture ovate or acuminate, the columella 

 notched below or continuous with the basal lip. Foot without pedal 

 grooves. Kidney with direct ureter, of the Basommatophorous type. 

 Genitalia with a long appendix on the penis, as in Achatinella and the 

 Pupillidoe. Jaw and radula about as in Pupillidoe. 



This group has usually been included in the Achatinidoe or Stenogy- 

 ridoe, but the direct ureter removes it to a group of primitive snails 

 represented only by minute species in America, but by the beautiful 

 Achatinellidce and Partulidoe in Polynesia. Coecilianella (Cecilioides)

ZONITIDiE. 



Omphalina extends to the western border of the Austroriparian 

 area in Texas. The form taken by us will be discussed in the conclud- 

 ing paper on Southwestern mollusks. 



Zonitoides minuscula (Binn.i. 



Texas: San Marcos, New Braunfels, near Hondo, Del Rio, Devil's 

 river and Pecos river. Everywhere common in drift debris. The 

 specimens all show a tendency to be more widely umbilicate than 

 typical Northern minuscula, a large part of them being typical Z. m. 

 alachuana (Dall). Those from San Marcos and Comal county are of 

 the size of Northern minuscula, but westward the shells reach a decid- 

 edly larger size, with the exception of the lot taken at Devil's river, 

 which show but little tendency towards a wide umbilicus. 



In Arizona, Ferriss took specimens of var. alachuana at Bear Park 

 and Cave creek canyon, Chiricahua mountains, in the drift of San 

 Pedro river at Benson, and in the Huachucas. Like other minutiae, 

 these shells are very rare in the Chiricahua and Huachuca mountains. 



Helix mauriniana Orb., from Cuba, which has been put in the 

 synonymy of minuscula, seems to be a Thysanophora close to or 

 identical with T. saxicola (Pfr.), as Arango has already stated. Z. 

 minuscula occurs also in Japan. 



Zonitoides minuscula neomexioana Pils and Ckll. 



This form is distinguished by the possession of minute and shallow 

 spiral striation. It seems to be of somewhat common occurrence in 

 New Mexico, and upon examining a set of seven specimens taken by 

 me in Galveston in 1885 I find that they are similarly sculptured. 

 They came from under boards in a lumber yard, and it may be that 

 they were brought from New Mexico with lumber, though I do not 

 know that any lumber was shipped from New Mexico twenty years 

 ago.

 Large specimens of this race are probably what has been reported from 

 Texas as sculptilis Bid., — a species which does not, we believe, occm- in 

 that State. 



This .Sonoran race differs from indentata by its distinctly perforate 

 axis and larger average size, yet the perforation varies so much in 

 size in specimens from the Carolinian zone that I would not myself 

 have named the Southwestern form. The name is ill-chosen, since the 

 shells are not ' ' umbilicate, ' ' as that term is technically used, but ' ' per- 

 forate. ' '

Vitrea dalliana roemori n. subsp. Fig. 8. 



Shell openly umbilicate, the width of umbilicus contained about 

 4f times in the diameter of the shell, pale whitish-corneous, in general 

 shape resembling V. dalliana, V. wheatleyi and V. petrophila. Sculp- 

 ture of very close and regular radial grooves, on the last whorl of large 

 specimens becoming crowded and less regular, giving a striate appear- 

 ance. The flat intervals between the grooves show no spiral striae. 

 The base is nearly smooth. Whorls 4^, but slightly convex, slowly 

 widening, the last about double the width of the preceding. Suture 

 scarcely impressed, translucent-margined below. Base convex. Aper- 

 ture lunate, slightly oblique ; the insertions of the peristome are distant.

 Also taken in several places around New Braunfels, Comal county; in 

 the drift debris of the Hondo river, two miles north of Hondo, Medina 

 county; in drift of the Rio San Filipe near Del Rio, and of the Devil's 

 river, Val Verde county. It has about the distribution of Holospira 

 goldfussi and Helicodiscus eigenmanni. 



This very pretty little species has a slightly more ample umbilicus 

 than V. wheatleyi or petrophila, and the sculpture is closer and more 

 regular than in either. The last whorl, in dorsal view, is wider than 

 in V . wheatleyi. It is much smaller than V. hammonis. 



V. dalliana roemeri attains a larger size than the Floridian V. dalliana 

 and the shells have somewhat more regular and crowded grooves on

the last whorl; it is less depressed, and the aperture is perceptibly less 

 broad, more roundly lunate. The differences seem sufficient to call for 

 subspecific separation. The Texan and Floridian areas of distribution 

 seem to be separated, so far as our present data 

 indicates. V. daUiana should be looked for along 

 the northern border of the Gulf. It is known now 

 from peninsular Florida only. 



Vitrea dalliana " and roemeri are much smaller 

 than V. hammonis, and seem to replace that in the 

 Austroriparian and Lower Sonoran zones. Wlien 

 originally described it was compared with Zonitoides 

 arhorea (Say), but it is not really related to that but 

 to the hammonis group. In fact V. hammonis, 

 hinneyana and dalliana form a group of very closely 

 related species. In a large number of V. dalliana 

 examined from several localities, the largest shell 

 measures, alt. 1.6, diam. 3.2, width of umbihcus 

 .75, aperture 1.4 mm. wide, 1.2 high. This shell, 

 from Osprey, Manatee county, Fla., is here figured. 

 The figures do not represent the fine and beautiful sculpture of the

 astomosing, and fine spiral striae, the latter distinct on the base. 



V. milium with the same number of whorls is smaller and more

 whorl are excessively weak or wanting, not deeply engraved to the 

 tip, as in Texas shells.

seem to be referable to this race. In the Northwest another form 

 of the species, Z. milium pugetensis Dall, replaces the typical milium. 

 Neither of the subspecies differs much from milium, but what differ- 

 entiation there is seems to be correlated with geographic range. 



This species was erroneously placed in Zonitoides in the Classified 

 Catalogue of 1898. We are now convinced that it belongs, as Morse 

 demonstrated, to the subgenus Striatura of Vitrea.

This shell, well known under the preoccupied name H. striatella 

 Anth., has typically a rounded periphery and moderately developed 

 oblique and sigmoid rib-strise, 4 or 5 in the space of a mm. on the 

 front of the last whorl at the periphery. There are 3^ to 3f whorls.

Texas : In 1885 I dug a single specimen of this species from the bank 

 of Comal creek, New Braunfels, where it occurred with several other 

 land and fresh-water shells. Singley reports it from the Pleistocene 

 of Swisher county. It is not known to occur living in Texas, or any- 

 where in the Austroriparian zone. Its occurrence in the Texan Pleisto- 

 cene is anomalous, like the presence of Pupilla blandi at New Braunfels. 



RADIODISCUS Pilsbry, n. gen. 



Minute, discoidal, openly umbilicate Patuloid snails with the first 

 1^ whorls minutely engraved spirally, the rest of the shell densely radi- 

 ally costulate; aperture lunate, but slightly oblique and as high as 

 wide. Type, R. millecostatus. 



This genus is proposed for a group of tiny Pyramidula-like snails, 

 various members of which have been found in Arizona, Mexico and 

 South America as far south as Patagonia. In the spiral sculpture of 

 the embryonic whorls these shells are like Helicodiscus ; in shape and 

 size they resemble Planogyra, but in that the embryonic shell is smooth. 

 There are also some similar Polynesian forms, referred to Charopa, etc. 



In the Endodontidce, where small differences in the shell characterize 

 extensive series of species, it seems desirable to recognize as of generic 

 value such readily recognizaljle groups as Radiodiscus. The species 

 are chiefly distinguished by their dimensions and the degree of fineness 

 of the sculpture. There are several undescribed forms in the collection 

 of the Academy. 

 Eadiodiscus millecostatus n. sp. Fig. 10. 



Shell very small, disk-shaped, chestnut-brown, the first whorl bluish- 

 white. Whorls 3f , slowly widening, separated by a very deep, chan- 

 nelled suture. The first whorl projects a little, and is microscopically 

 striate spirally, the rest of the whorls are radially very densely costu- 

 late, the riblets nearly straight, delicate and much narrower than

their intervals, and about 21 in number in a millimeter measm-ed at the 

 periphery, in the front of the last whorl. The last whorl is rounded 

 throughout. The umbilicus is widely open, its width contained about 

 three times in the diameter of the shell. The aperture is slightly 

 oblique and deeply lunate. Alt. 1.1, diam. 2 mm.; diam. of umbilicus 

 .6 to .7 nam.

Fig. 10. 



This tiny Patuloid, of a group new to our fauna, is one of the 

 most interesting recent finds. It is related to R. hermanni (Helix 

 hermanni Pfr.), of central and eastern Mexico, but that species is 

 larger and more coarsely sculptured. Thfe two species occur together 

 at the Mexican localities mentioned above, but are readily separable. 

 Dr. Henry Skinner found one broken specimen of R. millecostatus in 

 Carr canyon, Huachucas. 



Genus HELICODISCUS Morse. 



This genus has hitherto been consitlered to include two species, 

 lineatus (Say) and fimbriatus Wetherby. The accessions of Southwest- 

 ern material show that several other forms must be recognized. The 

 species are not very conspicuously differentiated, and young shells by 

 themselves are not always readily placed ; yet with adults we find no 

 difficulty. The salient characters of the forms follow: 



a. — Diam. of shell 3 to 3.5 mm., whorls 4 to 4^; teeth almost always 



present. Eastern United States, . . . H. parallelus (Say). 



a^. — Diam. of shell 4.5 to 5 mm., whorls 4^ to 5+; often deficient in 



teeth. 



b. — Spiral striae obsolete. Idaho. . . H. salmonensis (Hemph.). 




156 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March,

 small. Arizona and New Mexico,

This common species has been well described by Binney and others. 

 It has ordinarily four whorls, but there may be as many as 4J in excep- 

 tionally large shells. At least one pair of tubercular teeth may be 

 seen in most specimens. Shells of maximum size measure: 



Alt. 1.3, diam. 3.5 mm. (Grand Rapids, Mich.) 



Alt. 1.25, diam. 8 mm. (Philadelphia.) 



The typical form of H. 'parallelus is before me from localities in 

 Ontario, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, 

 Pennsylvania, Maryland, District of Columbia, Virginia, North Carolina, 

 Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Tennessee, 

 Alabama, Florida, Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Indian Territory. 



I have not seen Texan specimens of typical lineatus, but it doubtless 

 occurs in northern and eastern parts of the State. 



In New Mexico, at Pecos, Las Vegas, Mesilla, Sandia mountains and 

 other places, and in the Pecos river canyon near its mouth, Val Verde 

 county, Texas, there is a form of H. parallelus with rather weak, 

 sparse spirals, the intervals more distinctly striate radially than in typical 

 parallelus. This seems to be a form of the southeastern Rocky moun- 

 tains and southward to the Rio Grande, occupying territory between 

 the ranges of H. eigenmanni and H. arizonensis, with some overlapping 

 on the territory of the latter. 



Say's first name. Helix lineata, was preoccupied, but his Planorbis 

 parallelus applies to the same species. In the text of the Journal the 

 first letter of the name did not print up, but the space in place of it 

 shows that it had been there, and the p is correctly supplied in the 

 index. The type used in that volume of the Journal was old and full

 ical errors should be corrected. 

 Helicodiscus eigenmanni Pils. PI. VIII, figs 1, 2, 3. 



Nautilus, XIV, p. 41. August, 1900 (Beaver cave, near San Marcos, Texas). 



This fine species is easily recognized by its large size, the shell in 



all stages of growth being very much more robust than H. parallelus. It 



is sculptured with numerous spiral threads as in H. parallelus, and 



when fresh is pale yellow. Alt. 2, diam. 5 mm., with 5^ whorls. 



We took specimens in the drift debris of Sinking creek at San Mar- 

 cos, Hays county; on the Guadalupe river above New Braunfels, 

 Comal county; on the Hondo river, Medina county, and in the drift 

 of Devil's river, Val Verde county; Alpine, Brewster county. I have 

 seen specimens also from Calhoun county (Hubbard), Lee county 

 (Singley), and Navidad river bottom, Jackson county (J. D. Mitchell). 

 It has not been reported from any place out of Texas, and seems to 

 have about the same distribution as Holospira goldfussi. 

 Helicodiscus eigenmanni arizonensis n. subsp. PI. VIII, figs. 4, 5, 6. 



Shell larger than H. parallelus with 4^ to nearly 5^ whorls, the spire 

 flat or convex, the umbilicus wider than in parallelus or eigenmanni. 

 Surface closely and strongly lirulate spirally. Aperture oblique, lunate, 

 very small.

 Pecos at Las Vegas (Ckll.). 



Readily distinguished from H. parallelus when mature by the greater 

 size, with wider umbilicus, more whorls and proportionately smaller 

 mouth. Some specimens are two-toothed. H. eigenmanni has a 

 smaller umbilicus, whorls of markedly greater calibre and a larger 

 aperture.

158 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



I have not seen specimens. Mr. Binney in his first note considers the 

 Salmon river form identical with what Mr. Simpson reported as H. 

 fimbriatus from Indian Territory, and gives no separate or definite 

 description of it, though he mentions that Hemphill had given the 

 (MSS.) name "salmonacea." The figure of one of the original speci- 

 mens, given in Binney's Fourth Supplement, represents a shell with 

 wide umbilicus and small aperture, like H. arizonensis, from which it 

 differs, according to published information, by the smoother surface, 

 arizonensis being constantly very well sculptured. 



Punctum pygmaeum (Drap.). 



San Marcos, Hays county; Comal county; Hondo river, Medina 

 county; Devil's river, Val Verde county. 



The form in this region is slightly larger than northeastern speci- 

 mens, and is more strongly sculptured. There are barely four whorls, 

 the first H smooth, the next striate; the last two whorls have striae 

 at regular intervals much larger, with about six fine striae in each space, 

 and the basal spirals are very distinct. This sculpture reminds one 

 of the west coast forms, conspectum, pasadenoe and calif ornicum, which 

 however are decidedly larger and coarser shells of a dark brown color.

 canyon of the Pecos near the High Bridge. 



In Gould's original description the only locality given was Texas. 

 In the Terrestrial Mollusks he states "found in Florida, and more 

 abundantly in Texas, especially in the region of Galveston." Speci- 

 mens collected at Galveston by the author in 1885 agree perfectly 

 with Gould's figures, and that place may be taken to be the type 

 locality. I have seen no Florida shells which I would refer with cer- 

 tainty to luteola, though *S. floridana is closely related.

Distribution, Gulf States from Florida to the Rio Grande, on mud 

 or herbage near the water's edge. Common from Louisiana west- 

 ward, probably rare and local eastward. 



The type locality, Lake Concordia, is not in Texas, as Gould and 

 Binney supposed, but in Louisiana. The lake is an abandoned ox- 

 bow of the Mississippi river, opposite Naches, Mississippi. Some of Lea's 

 original lot of S. halei (haleana) before me show that to be merely the 

 young of concordialis. S. forsheyi Lea, of which two cotypes are in 

 the Philadelphia collection, is surely identical with concordialis. 



An adequate knowledge of the distribution of S. concordialis east- 

 ward awaits further exploration of the Gulf coastal peneplain, which 

 in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Florida has been very imper- 

 fectly examined for land molliLsks. I have not seen S. wilsoni Lea, 

 described from Darien, Ga., the figure of which looks a good deal like 

 concordialis, though it seems to be less swollen basally. Specimens col- 

 lected by Mr. A. A. Hinkley at Cypress creek, Ala., in 1895 are evi- 

 dently concordialis ; and a set of very pale shells, corneous instead of 

 amber-colored, before me from Mayport, Florida, collected by i\L A. 

 Mitchell about twenty years ago, seems to agree with concordialis in 

 everything but color. Northward it extends to Frierson (L. S. Frier- 

 son) and Bayou Pierre (George Williamson), in northwestern Louisiana, 

 the specimens from these places being rather small. .The species must 

 also extend in a long lobe up the Mississippi and its tributaries, for 

 typical specimens have lately been sent by Mr. A. A. Hinkley from 

 Dubois, Illinois, and by Mr. T. Van Hyning from Des Moines, Iowa. Mr, 

 Van Hyning notes that ' ' the animal is black with small yellow dots. ' ' 

 These Northern shells may be distinguished from »S. retusa by their 

 pot-bellied figure and reddish apex. 



In Texas, specimens were taken by us in April at San Marcos, Hays 

 county; New Braunfels, Comal county; San Antonio, Bexar county; 

 along the Rio Grande near and San Filipe river, at Del Rio. and along 

 the Devil's river, Val Verde county. We have seen it also from Lee 

 county (Singley) and Spring creek, Victoria county (J. D. Mitchell). 



It lives on the moist earth immediately adjacent to the water's 

 edge, and where found is usually abundant. It is a thin shell, rather

deeply amber-colored, with the apical whorls darker, reddish-orange. 

 Whorls 3^, the last deeply descending, somewhat flattened above, 

 very convex basally, having thus a more sack-like contour than S. 

 retusa; this being its chief peculiarity. The sculpture consists of rather 

 coarse wrinkles and often some indistinct spiral impressions on the 

 last whorl. The aperture is symmetrically ovate, the columella con- 

 cave throughout, with a delicate fold above. Large specimens from 

 San Marcos measure: 



Length 16.8, diam. 9, length of aperture 11.5, width 6.7 mm. 



Length 16, diam. 8, length of aperture 10.5, width 6 mm. 



The mantle is intensely black, dappled throughout in the last whorl 

 with rounded yellowish spots. Those above the kidney are brighter, 

 more conspicuous and usually larger, often more or less confluent. 



Fig. 11. 



Fig. 12. 



Towards the edge of the mantle the spots are large and lengthened. 

 The foot including head and eye-stalks is pale grayish-white, speckled 

 with irregular grayish-black spots. The sole is pale yellow. Figs. 

 11 and 12 were drawn from specimens taken at San Marcos, Texas, 

 near the river. 



SpecimeiLS from the Rio Grande and Devil's river are of almost as 

 large size; but in some situations it is much smaller, a set from along 

 the San FiUpe river at Del Rio measuring, length 12, diam. 6.7, length 

 of aperture 8 mm. Those taken at San Antonio and New Braunfels 

 are also of small size. Such variation in size is apparently not racial, 

 but dependent upon local conditions of the food supply, etc. The 

 color and markings of the mantle are substantially the same in all 

 colonies we found, though there is individual variation in the size of 

 the light spots, figure 12 representing one of the darker individuals.

This species is characterized by its very full, rounded whorls and 



irregular sculpture, often with traces of spiral lines, though as frequently 



without them. Having part of the original specimens of the above 



synonyms before us, we are convinced that the three supposed species 



cannot be separated, although one would hardly expect the same form 



to range from the lower Mississippi to and throughout the arid great 



plains and the mountain region of Colorado and New Mexico. 



Succinea greerii Tryon, described from Vicksburg, Mississippi, is a 

 little less swollen, with the suture not quite so deep, but it is doubtful 

 whether the slight differences shown by the lot of eight specimens 

 will prove constant. 



The species belongs to the campestris group.

164 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Marcll, 



The young of one season have a comparatively shorter spire than 

 old shells, the rate of descent of the suture progressively increasing 

 somewhat. As usual, there are only traces of malleation at this stage. 

 The erosion of the apices in all but one of the type lot (as mentioned 

 by Haldeman) makes them shorter than they would otherwise be, 

 giving much the appearance of L. h. cockerelli. Abundant series from 

 Houston and San Marcos collected by Pilsbry, with others from various 

 naturalists, demonstrate the identity of Haldeman's shells with the 

 larger-spired adult form figured above. L. tecJiella was formerly con- 

 sidered by one of us to be a synonym or race of L. cubensis Pfr., and 

 L. hulimoides was treated as a variety of the same species. They are cer- 

 tainly very similar, but cubensis has a more triangular and less broadly 

 developed columellar expansion; and in view of the way Lymnoea is 

 being split up into species and races, it may be best to retain the several 

 forms as distinct species or races until the subject can be taken up with 

 ample material and time for the study of Antillean and Mexican forms 

 together with our own.

This little species may be at once recognized by its spiral striation, 

 which is far stronger than in any other North American species. It is 

 flattened less than P. parvus. Only five specimens were taken, but 

 it is so unlike other known Mexican or United States Planorbes that 

 there seems no doubt of its specific distinctness.

Pilsbry, Nautilus, III, p. 63, pi. 1, figs. 1, 2, 3. 



This species is thin and delicate, very acutely carinate at the periphery 

 which is close to the left side. In 1889 one of us reported it from Hidalgo, 

 Texas, where it was taken by Mr. Singley. In 1903 we took a single 

 young shell in the drift debris of Devil's river, Val Verde county. The 

 young have a much less acute keel, in fact are angular rather than 

 carinate, and they are less compressed in proportion. P. cultratus is 

 found also in Florida (collected at Miami by S. N. Rhoads), Central 

 America and the West Indies. Few of the specimens thus far known 

 from Texas are fully mature or in good condition.

Well-grown specimens have a diameter of 9 to 10 mm., with about 

 5 whorls. 



Segmentina obstructa (Morel.)- 



Except for the teeth, this species is not distinguishable from Plan- 

 orbis liebmanni Dkr. It does not, however, attain quite so large a size, 

 the largest we have seen measuring slightly less than 9 mm. diameter. 

 The teeth are found in very young shells also ; but never more than one 

 set is present at any stage of growth, so far as seen. Specimens are 

 before us from the following places, all in Texas : 



Austin (E. Hall); San Marcos, Hays county; New Braunfels, Comal 

 county; Hondo river north of Hondo, Medina county (Pilsbry and 

 Ferriss) ; Brownsville, Cameron county (sent by G. H. Clapp) ; Hidalgo, 

 Hidalgo county (Singley) ; Rio San Filipe, Devil's river and Pecos 

 river, Val Verde county (Ferriss and Pilsbry). 



It has also a wide range in Mexico. 



The genus Segmentina was based upon the European species S. 

 nitida Miill. This is a very glossy, flattened shell with acutely angular 

 periphery, simple thin lip, deeply embracing whorls, and barriers com- 

 posed of three laminae (parietal, basal and upper) transverse to the 

 whorl, leaving a narrow, three-branched space between them. 



In eastern Asia a modification of this type is found in such species 

 as S. largillierti (Phil.), forming the subgenus Polypylis Pils. The 

 shell is less compressed and not carinate, but glossy with deeply 

 clasping whorls. The parietal lamina is obliquely transverse, the 

 others transverse, basal long, a shorter one in the outer wall, and one 

 or two in the upper margin. There are several or many barriers. 



The American forms, subgenus Planorbula Hald., have less smooth 

 and much less compressed shells, the whorls only slightly clasping, 

 often angular or subangular on the right side but rounded peripherally. 

 There are six laminae: a sigmoid, obliquely entering parietal with a 

 small tubercular denticle near its lower or left end ; a transverse basal ; 

 an obliquely entering outer lamina with a transverse one above it, and 

 a small entering lamina in the upper margin. 



In S. armigera the entering lamella in the outer margin curves up- 

 ward slightly at its inner end. In S. wheatleyi all of the laminae are 

 much more strongly developed, and the entering outer one is much 

 longer, running up in a long curve behind the transverse lamina above 

 it. The structures are, however, fundamentally identical in the two 

 species. 



In the Antillean and Mexican group to which S. obstructa belongs

the whorls are rounded, the parietal laminse are as in Planorbula ex- 

 cept that the larger one stands more obliquely, the basal lamina i 

 transverse, but all the rest on the outer wall are entering plicce, the larger 

 lower one curving downward a little at its inner end, not upward as in 

 armigera and wheatleyi. As in all American forms of the genus only 

 one set of laminae seems to be present in any individual, though the 

 earliest set is formed at a very early age. In the European and 

 Asiatic species several sets are usuall}' present.

 best specimens very faint, minute, spiral striae. Aperture ovate, the outer 

 lip thin, sigmoid, retracted below the upper insertion ; basal lip rounded 

 or subangular. Columella arcuate, somewhat thickened. Wliorls 

 about 7 in the most perfect shells, but usually fewer, the upper ones 

 being eroded.

Guadalupe river 6 to 4 miles to the north; San Marcos river at San 

 Marcos, Hays county, on the dam above the fish hatchery (Pilsbry 

 and Ferriss; Singley); a variety from Bexar county (A. G. Wetherby). 



This form differs from Melania pluristriata Say (M. rubida Lea) of 

 central Mexico, by its far smaller size and less ample aperture. The 

 type of pluristriata measured 1.25x.oo inches; of rubida 1.30x.57 

 inches; and the specimens -from Lake Chapala examined by Dr. von 

 Martens from 26 x 12 to 35 x 13 mm., while no Texan shell we have seen, 

 in many hundreds examined, reaches 1 inch long. Von Martens refers 

 the Mexican species to Pachycheilus. Dr. William H. Dall, to whom we 

 submitted specimens of G. comalensis for comparison with the type of 

 M. rubida Lea, writes that "though the general form is the same, the 

 rubida is very much larger and perfectly distinct." The examples 

 figured are from Comal creek. New Braunfels, near the mill. 



The ascertained distribution of G. comalensis comprises only the 

 short rivers of a single small system emptying into Espirito Santo Bay, 

 intercalated between the Colorado and Nueces basins, and comprising 

 the Guadalupe and San Antonio rivers and their tributaries. 



The Goniobases are known from these streams only at the edge of 

 the "Edwards Plateau." As they live on rocks, etc., in swift water, 

 it is not likely that they approach much nearer to the Gulf. In the 



Fig. 29. Fig. 30. Fig. 31. 



Colorado river, where Pilsbry collected in 1885, nothing was seen of the 

 species, nor has it been reported from the Nueces or its branches. We 

 saw no sign of Goniobasis in the tributaries of the Rio Grande, where 

 our collecting was extensive enough to have found it if it existed.^' 



The operculum (fig. 29) consists of about four whorls, the nucleus 

 being situated at about the lower third of its length. It is closely 



^^ In the collection of the Academy there are several specimens labelled ' ' Dal- 

 las county," received from Mr. J. A. Single^^ This is in the Trinity river 

 drainage, but Singley in his catalogue of 1893, issued long after these specimens 

 were placed in thejcollection, expressly states that he found the species nowhere 

 but in Comal and Hays counties. There was probably some error in labelling 

 the^specimens. 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 169 



marked with growth-wrinkles, and shows some striae at right angles 

 to them. 



The radula (fig. 30) is normal for Goniobasis. The central tooth 

 has 4, 1, 4 denticles, the inner lateral 2, 1, 4, inner uncinus 7, outer 

 about 20 denticles. An inner uncinus in profile is drawn on the ex- 

 treme right side (fig. 31), to show the length of the denticles, which 

 are foreshortened in fig. 30. 



G. comalensis is dimorphic, like G. virginica and many other species. 

 At New Braunfels the smooth form described as typical predominates, 

 but there are also some individuals with numerous acute spiral ridges, 

 about fifteen on the last whorl, but often fewer by suppression of those 

 just below the periphery. 



At San Marcos only the smooth phase was found, in several hundred 

 specimens taken. 



A series of 12 labelled "Bexar county," received from A. G. 

 Wetherby, consists wholly of multistriate shells, which moreover, 

 although collected alive, are of a whitish or livid whitish tint, in this 

 respect approaching the Mexican pluristriatus. The largest of this 

 lot is 23.5 mm. long, 9.3 wide, exceeding in size any seen from Comal 

 or Hays counties. These are part of the lot collected by Mr. G. W. 

 Marmock, of Bexar coimty, and commented on by Wetherby in the 

 American Naturalist for 1878. The "variety marmocki" mentioned 

 by him, but without a word of definition, may have been the smooth 

 form of the species, but there is nothing to indicate this either in 

 Wetherby's note or the set of shells he sent to Tryon.^^ 



P'orm fontinalis, nov. Figs. 32-35. 



In a small spring in the pleasure garden near New Braunfels, one of 

 the fountains of Comal creek, we found only very small shells, the largest 

 7 to 8.3 mm. long, 4.3 to 4.7 mm. wide, and of a markedly short, conic 

 shape. The old ones are much eroded, and none are of the multi- 

 striate phase. This race inhabits only the springs and the rapid streams 

 from them for a short distance down. 



In another, much larger spring, and the stream from it for about 

 fifty yards down, the shells are also dwarfs, though somewhat larger 

 than those from the smaller spring. 



These springs flow out of the limestone rock, the water being beauti- 

 fully clear. It is not cold, being perceptibly warmer than the river 

 at the time of our visit, about the middle of April. There is very little 

 vegetation upon the rocks, and the small size of the snails may be due 



" Mr. Wetherby also mentions that "Helix photus Pfr." was collected by Mr. 

 Marmock. This name may be an error for H. tholus W. G. B.

 Associated with them are numerous Physas, also of pygmy proportions, 

 though evidently adult. The snails of these springs evidently consti- 

 tute physiologic rather than morphologic varieties. 



AMNICOLID^ 

 Paludestrina seemanni (Ffld.). 



New Mexico: South Spring creek, near Roswell, in a Pleistocene 

 deposit (Cockerell and Tinsley, 1899). 



Texas: Drift debris of Pecos river, about a mile above the High 

 Bridge, Val Verde county (Pilsbry and Ferriss, 1903). 



Dr. R. E. C. Stearns has recorded this species from Death valley, 

 Inyo county, California. The specimens, some of which are before me,, 

 are somewhat more robust than those from New Mexico and Texas. 

 The above records largely increase the eastward range of the species. 



Paludestrina diaboli n. sp. Fig. 36. 



Shell very slender, turrite, shaped about like P. seemanni; composed 

 of 4^ very convex whorls separated by a deep suture. 

 Surface smooth. Aperture vertical, oval, a trifle nar- 

 rower above than below, but not angular there. Peris- 

 tome continuous, barely in contact with the preceding 

 w^horl for a short distance near the upper end. Umbili- 

 cus small but distinct. 



Length 1.3, diam. .62 mm. 



Drift debris of the Devil's river, about four miles from 

 its mouth, Val Verde county, Texas. A single shell was 

 also found on the Rio San Filipe near Del Rio, in the same county. 



The shells were all taken dead and bleached. It is readily separable 

 from P. seemanni by its diminutive size. This is the smallest species, 

 of its familv known from North America.

 growth-lines, and sculptured with unequal spiral threads, a few of the 

 larger ones dark colored. One thread at the shoulder is usually the 

 most prominent. In some shells the spirals are very weak, hardly 

 perceptible. Whorls 3^, moderately convex, flattened and sloping 

 below the suture, elsewhere rounded. Aperture quite oblique, rotundly 

 ovate, the peristome thin, equably arched except near the outer and 

 columellar insertions where it is noticeably straightened. The ends 

 are connected across the parietal wall by a thin or thick callus. The 

 columella is not noticeably thickened.

other species being Central American. ^^ The shell has much the ap- 

 pearance of Valvata, but is readily distinguished from that by its ovate, 

 not circular aperture, which is more or less conspicuously angular 

 above, and by having the whorls more compactly coiled. It should, 

 however, be said that we could not verify the generic reference of C. 

 riograndensis by examination of the operculum or radula, as unfor- 

 tunately none of the shells we obtained were living, though some were 

 fresh in appearance, and the operculum was not found. It consists of 

 few whorls in Cochliopa, as in Amnicola, while that of Valvata is 

 many-whorled with central nucleus. 



C. riograndensis is not closely related to any of the known species, 

 being of lighter texture, much more openly umbilicate, and with some- 

 what different sculpture. 



VALVATID^. 



Valvata micra n. sp. PI. IX, figs. 7, 8, 9. 



Shell excessively small, composed of 2^ tubular whorls ; spire nearly 

 flat; the last whorl is nearly round, barely or not quite in contact 

 with the preceding at the aperture, near which it enlarges more rapidly. 

 Suture deep. Surface finely, weakly striate. Aperture moderately 

 oblique, subcircular, the peristome simple, continuous. Umbilicus 

 ample but rapidly narrowing within.

" Prof, von Martens defines four species of Cochliopa in the Biologia Centrali 

 Americana — guatemalensis Morel., tryoniana Pils., trochulus and infundibulum 

 Marts, (pp. 428, 429). He omits C. roivelli Tryon, which was originally described 

 from Clear Lake, California. Rev. J. Rowell, who found the original specimens, 

 now states (m litt.) that " Cochlicopa Rowellii was named from shells collected 

 by me near Baulinas Bay (not Clear Lake), Marin county, California." There 

 are authentic specimens from Central America in the collection of the Academy, 

 so that I still doubt whether the species really was actually collected in Cali- 

 fornia. 



Prof, von Martens surmises that C. guatemalensis (Morel.), which he had 

 not seen, may not be different specifically from C. tryoniana ; but it is in fact not 

 even closely related to that species, being very much smaller, more depressed, 

 and evenly sculptured with threadlike spirals." The suture descends shortly in 

 front in fully mature shells. An additional locality is Polvon, in western Nicara- 

 gua (McNiel in coll. A. N. S. Phila.). I have examined the radula of C. guate- 

 malensis which proves to be Amnicoloid, and demonstrates the species to be a 

 Cochliopa, not a Valvata as Morelet supposed. The central tooth has the formula 

 ~, tjie inner lateral has 6 denticles, the third from the inside being largest, 

 and its body has the usual boss or projection below. The inner uncinus has 13, 

 the outer very many excessi^'ely minute denticles.

whorl at the aperture shows it to be adult. Five specimens were taken. 

 The shells are all more or less bleached, the freshest being of a pale 

 corneous tint. The round whorls, deep suture and general appear- 

 ance are quite unlike any Planorbis or Vallonia, and indicate, we think, 

 either that it is a Valvata or an Amnicoloid snail comparable to Horatia 

 Bgt. or Daudehardiella Bttg. in the Paltearctic fauna. Until fresh 

 specimens with the soft parts or operculum are found, the position of 

 this molluscan atom will remain uncertain. 



Valvata micra nugax (pi. IX, fig. 6), a slightly larger form, alt. .9 

 diam. 1.5 mm., with three whorls and a projecting spire, may prove to 

 be a distinct species; but for the present, until more specimens are 

 found, it may be placed under T^. micra as a variety or form.

 compressed than those described as typical, one measuring, length 4.1,

It is a prettily maculate little clam, widely distributed in Texan 

 waters. The largest shell I have seen measures 6 mm. long. It may 

 prove to be specifically identical with E. maculata Morelet. of Yucatan, 

 but that name is preoccupied by Anton for another species of the same 

 group. Both were described as Cyclas and belong to Eupera. For 

 this reason Crosse and Fischer proposed to substitute the name yiica- 

 tanense; but five years previously I had described and figured S. sing- 

 ley i. The latter name will therefore stand.

A list of species taken by us in Arkansas, Indian Territory and

A MONOGRAPH OF THE GENUS COLLOCALIA. 



BY HARRY C. OBERHOLSER. 



There is perhaps no other group of Swifts that equals in general 

 interest the genus Collocalia. Some of the species build edible nests 

 wholly or partly of saliva which is secreted in large quantities by 

 salivary glands of unusual size; and the gathering and marketing of 

 these nests has in some places and at some times grown to a traffic of 

 considerable importance. 



Owing to the great similarity of many of the species, and the ob- 

 scurity of the characters separating them, the group is one of the most 

 difficult in the entire family Micropodidse. Published descriptions,^ 

 particularly those of the older authors, are often so brief and so lacking 

 in mention of really diagnostic characters that it is hard, sometimes 

 even impossible, to determine with certainty the form intended. For- 

 tunately, perhaps, the sexes, except in a very few cases, are practically 

 identical both in size and coloration. Notwithstanding the fact that 

 some authors have minimized the importance of difference in size, 



^ The most important papers on the genus are as follows:

this is often one of the very best and most appreciable distinctions 

 between both species and subspecies. 



One of the most sm-prising as well as interesting developments of 

 our study has been the discovery of so many undescribed members of 

 the genus, among which two entirely distinct species with wholly 

 brownish lores like Collocalia leucophaea seem especially notable, as 

 does also one from New Caledonia allied to Collocalia leucopygia. 

 Most of the new forms are here elaborated from material recently col- 

 lected, and upon which no published report has yet been made. 



Much confusion has hitherto arisen because of failure properly to 

 discriminate those birds which have the tarsus more or less feathered 

 from those in which it is entirely bare. In some cases forms with 

 feathered and others with unfeathered tarsi have been considered sub- 

 specifically related or even identical ! The difficulty vanishes, however, 

 if all the birds with any feathering on the tarsus be considered apart 

 from the rest and placed, as they apparently should be, and as they are 

 in the following pages, in a separate subgeneric group. Indeed, it may 

 be best to regard them as even generically distinct, though it is not 

 here so done, because this character of tarsal feathering is the sole one 

 separating the groups, and while very marked in such forms as Col- 

 localia innominata, it is but slight, sometimes difficult to appreciate, 

 therefore in a sense intermediate, in Collocalia fuciphaga and its allies ; 

 and because if there be any logical difference between a genus and a 

 subgenus, the criterion of practical intergradation of characters through 

 intermediate species should be so considered. 



The proper generic name for the whole group seems to be Collocalia 

 — the one of current usage. The name Salangana St.-Hilaire has been 

 recently substituted ^ because supposedly of earlier date, but Salangana 

 now proves first to have been employed simply in a vernacular sense,^ 

 and to be citable as a generic term only from a later article ^ which is 

 posterior to the work containing Collocalia Gray.^ There are no other 

 synonyms. 



The material used in the preparation of the present memoir aggre- 

 gates 159 specimens, principally of recent collection, and represents 

 very nearly all the recognized forms. It is in large part that of the 

 United States National Museum, which is now, through the many 

 donations from Dr. W. L. Abbott, of considerable extent and includes 

 good series of many of the species. This has been supplemented by

This species may readily be distinguished from all its congeners with 

 feathered tarsi, excepting Collocalia innominata and C. agnota, by the 

 white band on the rump ; and from all but Collocalia agnota by the

white or whitish abdomen. In color it approaches rather near some 

 species of the subgenus Collocalia, notably some forms of Collocalia 

 francica, but the whitish abdomen is of course diagnostic. 

 Collocalia agnota sp. nov. 



Chars, sp. — Similar to Collocalia leucopygia, but upper surface 

 lighter, much more brownish; chin, upper throat, and sides of head 

 much paler brown ; ventral surface from the lower throat to anal region 

 more purely white, the jugulum and breast white like the abdomen, 

 and contrasting sharply with the grayish brown of the chin and upper 

 throat; feathers of breast and abdomen without noticeably darker 

 shaft lines ; basal portion of rectrices much paler. 



Geographical distribution. — Island of New Caledonia. 



Description. — Type, adult female. No. 8,757, American Museum of 

 Natural History; New Caledonia; Verreaux Collection. Upper parts 

 brownish black, the pileum with some metallic greenish gloss, the l^ack 

 with a faint suggestion of the same, the cervix a little lighter and more 

 brownish ; rump with a broad band of pure white, the feathers of which 

 have dark brown shaft lines; rectrices externally brownish black, with 

 a slight bluish metallic sheen, internally more brownish, and proxi- 

 mally growing paler until at base they are quite light brown, but without 

 white spots; wings brownish black with some metallic sheen, the inner 

 margins of quills fuscous; lores, orbital region, and a narrow line across 

 the forehead sepia brown, the feathers of the lores with pure white 

 bases; sides of neck and breast grayish brown, much lighter than the 

 cervix; chin and upper throat dull broccoli brown; rest of lower parts 

 medially almost pure white, though just appreciably brownish an- 

 teriorly, the sides of body washed with brownish, the shorter lower 

 tail-coverts pale brownish gray with darker shaft lines and whitish 

 margins, the longest ones dark brown, with distally a metallic sheen; 

 thighs brownish black; lining of wings dark brown. 



Wing, 105; tail, 46; exposed culmen, 4; tarsus, 9 mm. 



The relationships of this evidently distinct and apparently unde- 

 scribed species are undoubtedly with Collocalia leucopygia, as is indi- 

 cated by the conspicuously feathered tarsi, the white abdomen, and 

 the white rump band with dark shaft lines. The only specimen known 

 is the above described one in the American Museum of Natural History. 

 Collocalia innominata Hume.

 Collocalia maxima Hume, Stray Feathers, IV, 1876, p. 223 (Mergui and Bank- 

 asoon, Tenasserim) (nomen nudum). 



Chars, sp. — Quite different from Collocalia leucopygia: much larger; 




18:1 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [April, 



entire lower surface dark brownish gray; upper parts more brownish, 

 the light rump band decidedly less conspicuous. 



Wing, 130-137; tail, 50-56; exposed culmen, 6; tarsus 12-12.5 mm. 



Type locality.— Fort Mouat, South Andaman Island, Andaman 

 Islands. 



Geographical distribution.— Sonthern Tenasserim to Lower Siam and 

 Perak, Malay Peninsula; Mergui Archipelago; accidental(?) on South 

 Andaman Island. 



The large size, feathered tarsi, light brownish rump band with dark 

 shaft lines, and the conspicuously darker mesial lines of the lower 

 surface, which last are present in only a few forms of CoZZocaha, 'suffic- 

 iently distinguish this very strongly characterized species. An adult 

 female taken by Dr. W. L. Abbott on September 5, 1896, at Trong, 

 Lower Siam, proves its occurrence in that region. 



Collocalia ocista sp. nov. 



Chars, sp. — Similar to Collocalia leucophaeae, but tarsi feathered ; 

 slightly smaller, except the tail which is longer ; upper surface, includ- 

 ing wings and tail, darker, more blackish (less brownish), and on head 

 and back as well as elsewhere with a decided greenish metallic gloss; 

 lower parts more grayish. 



Geographical distribution. — Marquesas and Society Islands. 



Description. — Type, adult female; Nukahiva Island, Marquesas 

 Islands, September 16, 1899; Charles H. Townsend. Upper surface 

 almost uniform dark sooty brown, slightly deeper on the pileum, a 

 little lighter on the rump — neither of these differences very noticeable 

 — and everywhere with a greenish metallic sheen; wings and tail darker, 

 more blackish, with a bluish or purplish metallic gloss, the wing-coverts 

 slightly more greenish, the innermost secondaries and inner margins of 

 the quills, at least basally, lighter and more brownish — about the same 

 color as the back; sides of head clove brown almost as dark as the 

 crown, the lores quite so, the loral feathers with lighter brown bases; 

 lower parts nearly uniform deep brownish gray, only the chin and 

 longest under tail-coverts somewhat darker; lining of wing clove brown. 



This new and very interesting bird is superficially so much like 

 Collocalia leucophaea, with the type of which it has been compared, 

 that a specimen in the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, 

 collected long ago in the Marquesas Islands, and presented by Dr. 

 Gambel, was so labelled ; but the species may readily be separated by 

 the characters above given. It is fully as dark below as C. leucophaea, 

 and like that species is peculiar in possessing light brown bases to the

feathers of the lores. From Collocalia fuciphaga fuciphaga, which also 

 to some extent it superficially resembles, it may be distinguished by 

 its larger size and more brownish upper parts, as well as most trench- 

 antly by the light brown instead of pure white bases of the loral feathers. 

 From Collocalia fuciphaga elaphra, a subspecies hereinafter described,^ 

 with which it agrees in size, and which it more closely approaches in 

 the general color of the upper surface, it differs in being rather more 

 blackish and more uniform above, the rump not so appreciably paler 

 than the back; in having much darker lower surface; also, and most 

 decidedly, in having the bases of the feathers of the lores light brown. 

 This last character alone will separate it from all forms of the genus 

 excepting C. leucophaea and C. thespesia.^ 



Three specimens of this new species were collected by ilr. Charles 

 H. Townsend in 1899, during his recent Pacific cruise on the U. S. Fish 

 Commission steamer ''Albatross." One of these, the single specimen 

 from Tahiti, is rather more brownish above, and a little paler on the 

 crissum than the type, but is very different from C. leucophaea ; another, 

 from the Marquesas Islands, is more blackish above and slightly darker 

 below; but the old specimen in the collection of the Academy of 

 Natural Sciences of Philadelphia is practically identical with our type.

Chars, subsp. — Similar to Collocalia leucophaea, but decidedly smaller; 

 tarsus sparsely feathered ; bases of the loral feathers pure white ; upper 

 parts very much more blackish, and rather more uniform, the rump

Type locality. — Java. 



Geographical distribution. — East India Islands and western Poly- 

 nesia, from Nias, Java, Borneo, and the Natuna Islands, northeast 

 to the Philippine, Mariana, and Caroline Islands, east and southeast 

 to New Guinea, Duke of York Island, Tonga (Friendly) and Loyalty 

 Islands. 



The birds of a good series, consisting of specimens from Java, the 

 Philippine and Caroline Islands, and from Nias Island, off the western 

 coast of Sumatra, are very uniform in size as well as in the dark lower 

 surface and glossy blackish upper parts, indicating thus that the name 

 Hirundo vanikorensis Quoy and Gaimard,^" which was based on the 

 bird from the Santa Cruz Islands, is synonymous with Hirundo fuci- 

 phaga Thunberg,^^ from Java. A single specimen from Guam Island 

 is, however, much more brownish above than any of the others ex- 

 amined, and may represent an und escribed race. Much of the difficulty 

 heretofore experienced in identifying this species and in segregating 

 its various forms has arisen from confusing with it the birds with light 

 lower surface and unfeathered tarsi, which occur in various localities, 

 and most if not all of which are Collocalia unicolor amelis. 



The tail in Collocalia fuciphaga is usually quite deeply emarginate, 

 but this character varies greatly. Some specimens in our series have 

 the tail almost even, and there is every gradation evident between 

 this condition and that of greatest emargination, differences apparently 

 to be accounted for only by individual variation. Care must therefore 

 be exercised in using the shape of the tail as an absolute character to 

 distinguish this species.

The original CoUocalia fuciphaga was based on the bird from Java, 

 from which this western form differs as above said. For the latter the 

 name Salangana vestita Lesson ^^ seems to be available. This is 

 founded on " Hirundo esculenia Lath. Gen. Syn. pi. Hab. les iles de la 

 Malasie," ^^ which in both description and locality (Sumatra) is perti- 

 nent to the present form. Moreover, the only Sumatran specimen 

 examined agrees with the birds from Simalur Island, upon which latter 

 the present separation is primarily based. The Nias Island bird, how- 

 ever, is identical with that of Java, as already noted, and therefore 

 must be called CoUocalia fuciphaga fuciphaga. A single adult from 

 Tanjong Silantei, on the east coast of Johore, southern Malay Peninsula, 

 seems to be exactly like the birds from Simalur Island in color, but is 

 considerably larger, the wing measuring 118 mm. ; notwithstanding this 

 it seems best referred, for the present at least, to C. f. vestita, although 

 additional specimens may show it to be representative of a recognizable 

 subspecies.

Collocalia fuciphaga elaphra subsp. nov. 



Chars, subsp. — Similar to Collocalia fuciphaga fuciphaga, but de-

 rump being noticeably lighter than the back; lower surface decidedly 

 paler.

 Upper surface sooty brown, with a very slight greenish gloss, the 

 pileum rather darker and more greenish, the rump much lighter 

 brownish — but not whitish — this due partially to the lighter bases of 

 the feathers; wings and tail darker, more blackish, with a dull bluish, 

 greenish or purplish sheen, the wing-coverts decidedly greenish; sides 

 of head and neck dark brown, darkest on the lores, where the feathers 

 have pure white bases; entire lower surface rather deep brownish gray, 

 somewhat paler posteriorly, darker on chin, the longest under tail- 

 coverts slightly glossed with greenish ; lining of wing blackish brown. 



The specimens on which this race is principally established were 

 collected by Dr. W. L. Abbott on Mahe, one of the Seychelles Islands. 

 They differ so much from typical Collocalia fuciphaga, of which we 

 have a considerable series from several localities, that it seems necessary 

 to regard them as representatives of another subspecies. 



The lighter colored rump, which seems to be one of the best char- 

 acters of this race, is not sufficiently decided to give the impression of 

 a whitish band such as exists in Collocalia francica and its allies, but it 

 is nevertheless quite different from the uniformly dark condition ob- 

 taining on the upper surface of Collocalia fuciphaga fuciphaga. From 

 Collocalia fuciphaga vestita, which in some respects it resembles more 

 closely than it does true fuciphaga, it may readily be distinguished by 

 its greater size, lighter, more brownish, and less uniform upper surface, 

 with the rump noticeably paler than the back. This new race, how-

ever, does not need special comparison with any further forms of the 

 genus, even those possessing feathered tarsi. 



Two adults from Pulo Jimaja, Anamba Islands, are somewhat less 

 brownish above, as well as very slightly darker below, but nevertheless 

 agree in all details of coloration quite closely with the birds from the 

 Seychelles Islands, and differ thus quite remarkably from Collocalia 

 fuciphaga fuciphaga, by whose range the Anamba Islands are pretty 

 well surrounded. In all measurements excepting that of the wing 

 these two specimens exceed the measurements of fuciphaga and equal 

 or even surpass those of elaphra; but the wing-quills are molting and 

 not fully grown, and there are indications from the relative length of 

 the primaries that the length of the wing would have become when 

 perfect almost if not quite as great as that of elaphra. In light of pre- 

 sent knowledge, therefore, it seems best to refer to elaphra, with the 

 above explanation, these two examples from the Anamba Islands, 

 even though by so doing elaphra presents an anomalous geographical 

 distribution. Should, however, a satisfactory series show the Anamba 

 bird to be really much smaller than that from the Seychelles Islands, 

 and reasonably constant in its slight color differences, it ought 

 probably to be separated subspecifically. 



Measurements of two adults of Collocalia fuciphaga elaphra are here 

 given :

ered identical with Collocalia unicolor, from which, however, it may 

 readily be distinguished by its feathered tarsi, darker, less brownish 

 upper surface, with rump appreciably lighter than the back. It is 

 most closely allied to Collocalia fuciphaga, and by Dr. Hartert is con- 

 sidered a subspecies of this; but its large size and other characters, 

 combined with its isolated range, so far as C. fuciphaga is concerned, 

 quite clearly indicate its specific distinctness. Furthermore, there is, 

 so far as is known at present, no intergradation in size between Collocalia 

 brevirostris and any form of Collocalia fuciphaga; and the race of the 

 latter, C. f. elaphra, which is nearest in size is most different in color. 

 The so-called intermediate specimens from the western Himalayas, 

 mentioned by Dr. Hartert,^^ have proved to be examples of Collocalia 

 unicolor, a form belonging to the group without feathers on the tarsus, 

 and have thus no bearing on the question. Therefore, until actual 

 proof of intergradation with Collocalia fuciphaga be forthcoming, the 

 present form should stand as a full species.

This species resembles Collocalia leucopygia and Collocalia innomi- 

 nata in possessing dark shaft lines on the lower surface, and in this it 

 differs with them from all the other members of the subgenus. In 

 color above and below — except for the lack of a light rump band — 

 as w^ell as in size and proportions, it is identical with Collocalia innomi- 

 nata. It is so much larger, and usually has the tail so much less 

 deeply emarginate, -than Collocalia fuciphaga and all subspecies of the 

 latter that further comparison is unnecessary. One specimen in the 

 United States National Museum has the tail by no means square, but 

 considerably emarginated, from which it is evident that there is con- 

 siderable individual variation in this regard.

CoUocalia origenis sp. nov. 



Chars, sp. — Resembling CoUocalia ivhiteheadi, but upper parts much 

 darker, more blackish, and more uniform, the rump not appreciably 

 lighter than the back; under surface darker, and throat not decidedly 

 paler than abdomen. 



Geographical distribution. — Mindanao, Philippine Islands. 



Description.— Type, adult male. No. 192,162 U. S. N. M. ; Mount Apo, 

 4,000 feet, Mindanao, Philippine Islands, July 4, 1904; Dr. E. A. 

 Mearns. Upper siu-face uniform brownish black, the rump not lighter, 

 but wings and the distinctly forked tail more brownish, their feathers 

 paler along the inner margins; entire ventral sm'face uniform smoky 

 hair brown, the throat not paler; sides of head and neck darker brown 

 than the under parts; a blackish spot in front of the eye; lining of wing 

 blackish brown. 



This new species was discovered by Dr. Mearns during his recent 

 trip to the island of Mindanao, the four adults obtained having been 

 brought by natives who had found them in a cave on Mount Apo ; and 

 we are indebted to him for the privilege of describing them. 



In its large size, deeply emarginate tail, and lack of tarsal feathering 

 CoUocalia origenis agrees with CoUocalia whiteheadi, but is readily dis- 

 tinguishable by the dark colors, particularly on the upper parts which 

 are even more blackish than in CoUocalia fiiciphaga fuciphaga from the 

 Philippines. There is a slight sexual difference in this species, appa- 

 rent in our series of two adult males and two adult females, but it is 

 possibly not constantly distinctive: the females are somewhat more 

 brownish above, and slightly paler below. A very young bird, with 

 wings and tail but little grown, taken by Dr. Mearns, July 11, 1904, 

 at Todaya, altitude 4,000 feet, on ]\Iount Apo, is fully as l^lackish on 

 the upper parts as the adults, and somewhat darker, decidedly more 

 grayish on the ventral surface.

Collocalia whitehead! Grant. 



Collocalia whiteheadi Grant, Ibis, 1895, p. 459. 



Chars, sp. — Similar in color to Collocalia loici, but dark shaft streaks

 tarsi, and usually more deeply emarginate tail.

Type locality. — Monte Data, highlands of Lepanto, northern Luzon,

Geographical distribution. — Islands of Luzon and Palawan, Philippine 

 Islands. 



This very distinct species may be easily distinguished from all the 

 others with unfeathered tarsi, excepting Collocalia origenis, by its ^-ery 

 large size, and from that form by the well-marked color characters 

 already detailed. Specimens from Palawan are smaller than those 

 from Luzon, touching the minimum of measurements above given, 

 and also appear to be more brownish on the upper parts — differences 

 which, should they prove reasonably constant, would entitle the 

 Palawan bird to subspecific rank.

Chars, subsp. — Resembling Collocalia ichiteheadi, but much smaller; 

 more brownish and more uniform above, the rump not appreciably 

 paler than the back, the pileum but little if any darker; lower surface 

 rather more brownish and more uniform, the throat usually not lighter 

 than the abdomen; lining of wing lighter. 



Wing, 112-120.5; tail, 50-56; exposed culmen, 4-4.5; tarsus, 9-10 

 ,mm. 



Type locality. — Coonoor Pass, Nilghiri Hills, southern India. 



Geographical cUstrihution. — Ceylon; and the western coast region of 

 southern India, north to Vengmia; western Himalayas. 



Although this species has commonly been either synonymized with 

 Collocalia fuciphaga or treated as a subspecies of it, the entirelj^ un- 

 feathered tarsi are a character fully sufficient for specific recognition; 

 and furthermore the upper surface is more brownish than in even the 

 least blackish forms of Colloc*lia fuciphaga. In fact Collocalia uni- 

 color is really more closely allied to Collocalia ichiteheadi than to Col- 

 localia fuciphaga! Dr. Hartert has given" as a reason for considering 

 C. unicolor a subspecies of C. fuciphaga that some Celebes birds similar 

 to C. unicolor in color, which he refers to C. fuciphaga, have no tarsal

feathers ; but these have hardly bearing on the question, for they without 

 much doubt belong to Collocalia unicolor amelis. The present form is 

 said to occur in the western Himalaya Mountains, but careful compari- 

 son of a satisfactory series from this locality with typical examples 

 from southern India would possibly show subspecific differences. Im- 

 mature birds of Collocalia unicolor are rather darker, more sooty than 

 adults, both above and below, 



Collocalia unicolor amelis subsp. nov. 



Chars, subsp. — Similar to Collocalia unicolor unicolor, but less brown- 

 ish and less uniform above, the rump usually appreciably paler than 

 the back, the pileiun decidedly darker; lower surface rather less brown- 

 ish and less uniform, the throat usually decidedly lighter than the 

 abdomen; lining of wing darker; tail usually rather less deeply 

 emarginate. 



Geographical distribution. — Philippine Islands; Island of Guam; 

 ? Celebes; ? Louisiade Archipelago. 



Description.— Type, adult male, No. 189,931 U. S. N. M. ; Irisan, Ben- 

 guet, Luzon, Philippine Islands, May 19, 1903; R. C. McGregor and A. 

 Celestino. Upper parts dark sooty brown with a greenish tinge and 

 but little gloss, the head darker, the rump slightly paler; wings and tail 

 darker than the back — blackish brown with a greenish sheen, the inner 

 webs of the wing-quills dull and paler brown; lower surface grayish 

 brown, darkest on the lower tail-coverts, palest on the throat and 

 jugulum; lining of wing blackish brown. "Iris brown, bill and claws 

 black; legs dark reddish brown." 



Several specimens of this new form, identified as Collocalia white- 

 headi, were some time since received from the Philippine Museum by 

 the U. S. National Museum. Notwithstanding the similarity of pro- 

 portions (including the forking of the tail), the very great difference 

 in size renders it easily distinguishable from C. whiteheadi on even 

 superficial examination. From Collocalia francica and other light- 

 rumped species Collocalia unicolor amelis is at once to be separated 

 by its lack of the whitish band on the rump. Its nearest relative 

 is, of course, Collocalia unicolor unicolor of southern India, from 

 which, though similar in size, it differs as above mentioned ; but com- 

 parison of a series of each of these forms shows none^of the characters 

 to be quite constant, hence amelis must rank as a subspecies. The 

 tarsi in C. u. amelis are entirely devoid of feathers, therefore no special 

 comparison is really necessary with Collocalia fuciphaga and its allies, 

 except for specimens of fuciphaga that have accidentally lost the tarsal

feathering. In color C. u. amelis differs from C. fuciphaga fuciphaga 

 by reason of paler ventral surface, particularly the throat, and more 

 brownish upper parts, with lighter rump. It is paler, more brownish 

 above than C. f. vestita, with the rump noticeably lighter than the 

 back. Compared with C. /. elaphra it has the upper parts less brown- 

 ish, the crown particularly more blackish, the rump less different 

 from the back; lower surface less uniform, the posterior portion darker; 

 and size somewhat less. 



The small Celebes birds without tarsal feathering, mentioned by Mr. 

 Grant,^^ belong probably to this subspecies, for they are evidently not 

 Collocalia fuciphaga. Also the birds from St. Aigan Island, in the 

 Louisiade Archipelago, said by Dr. Hartert ^^ to be light below, to have 

 unfeathered tarsi, and to build nests different from C. fuciphaga, are 

 probably to be referred to C. u. amelis, though possibly subspecifically 

 distinct. Aside from the above, Collocalia u. amelis is not at present 

 certainly known except from the Island of Guam, where taken by Dr. 

 E. A. Mearns, July 20, 1905, and from the Philippine archipelago, where 

 it has been obtained on the Islands of Luzon, Verde, Cagayancillo, 

 Sibuyan, Panay, Mindoro, Mindanao, and Palawan. It may, however, 

 be quite generally distributed over the East India Islands, and may 

 have been recorded as Collocalia fuciphaga from various localities, since 

 hitherto it seems to have been confused with that species, because its 

 unfeathered tarsi were not considered significant. 



Measurements of part of the U. S. National Museum series of Collo- 

 calia unicolor amelis are as follows:

This very distinct species is superficially somewhat like CoUocalia 

 fuciphaga clophra from the Seychelles, but lacks the tarsal feathers; 

 is larger, more brownish above, with less metallic gloss; much darker, 

 duller, more uniform on the lower surface; and has brownish in place of 

 white bases to the loral feathers. It is of course still more different 

 from CoUocalia fuciphaga fuciphaga, being much larger, decidedly more 

 brownish, with scarcely any metallic gloss above, and having neither 

 feathers on the tarsi nor white bases to the feathers of the lores. On 

 the Island of Tahiti alone is this species positively known to occur, 

 since all the specimens from the ^larquesas Islands now at hand prove 

 to belong to CoUocalia ocista. All previous records of this species from 

 the Marcjuesas Islands therefore need verification, though of course 

 its occurrence there is by no means improbable. 



Even if the name given to this species by Cassin — CoUocalia cinerea ^^ 

 — were not, as has already been show^n by Dr. Hartert," a mistaken 

 identification of his specimen with the Hirundo cinerea of Gmelin,^^ 

 which is a swallow — Atticora cinerea — it would still not be the tenable 

 name for the present species, since it is ten years posterior to the Ma-

 November 14, 1899; C. H. Townsend. Pileum clove brown; cervix, 

 back, upper tail-coverts, and part of rump rather lighter and slightly 

 more rufescent with scarcely any metallic gloss; rump with a very 

 light brown band, slightly whitish along the edges of the feathers, and 

 similar to that of CoUocalia francica francica, though apparently not 

 quite so broad or so pale, the feathers with somewhat though not 

 very conspicuously defined deeper brown shafts; wings and tail darker 

 than upper parts, and somewhat blackish with a slight purplish or 

 bluish sheen, but the basal portion of the rectrices and the inner edge 

 of the wing-quills decidedly more brownish — much like the back; 

 median and lesser wing-coverts with the tertials also rather lighter, 

 more brownish than the quills, and somewhat glossed with greenish; 

 sides of head clove brown almost as dark as the crown, the feathers of 

 the lores with lighter brown bases ; sides of neck brown like the cervix ; 

 lower surface the same, but lighter, becoming still a little paler on the 

 abdomen, considerably so and appreciably more rufescent on the 

 crissum; lining of wing clove brown. 



Wing, 122; tail, 58; exposed culmen, 5; tarsus, 10 mm. 



The single specimen of this new and remarkable species was ob- 

 tained by Mr. Townsend during the cruise of the "Albatross" already 

 mentioned. It differs very strongly from CoUocalia francica spodio- 

 pygia, the light-rumped form from the Samoan Islands, in its larger 

 size, lighter, much more brownish upper parts, rather more narrow 

 rump band, darker, more uniform ventral surface, and especially, as 

 from all other species of the entire genus excepting C. leucophaea and 

 C. ocista, by the brownish instead of pure white bases of the loral 

 feathers. From CoUocalia leucophaea it may of course be easily dis- 

 tinguished by the pale band across the rump, as well as by somewhat 

 less brownish upper surface and decidedly paler anal region. From 

 CoUocalia ocista it differs in lack of tarsal feathers, in more brownish 

 upper surface, pale rump band, and lighter anal region. 



The only published name that can by any possibility apply to this 

 species is Hirundo peruviana Forster,-^ based on a specimen said to 

 have been obtained on Tahiti. But unless the description of this bird 

 is very erroneous it cannot refer to thespesia, as the following quotation 



^^Descript. Anim., 1844, p. 240.

will show :" Corpus totum supra cum remigibus, rectricibusque nigro- 

 nitens. Uropygium, gula, pectus, abdomen, crissum cinereo-fuliginosa."-^ 

 The upper surface in thespesia is by no means "nigro-nitens," being 

 dark brown, scarcely more blackish than the same part in Collocalia 

 leucophaea; while the rump is not of the same color as the dark gray 

 ventral surface, but is very much paler, even whitish. The description 

 of peruviana very much better fits Collocalia francica spodiopygia, to 

 which it should probably be referred.

Chars, sp. — Like Collocalia unicolor amelis, but somewhat smaller;

 white band across the rump; paler below, especially on the abdomen 

 and crissum; lining of wing paler, more brownish.

This form bears some resemblance to Collocalia innominata, but is 

 of course much smaller ; more brownish above, with a paler rump band 

 which has not conspicuously darker shafts ; darker below, particularly 

 posteriorly, without noticeably darker shaft lines; and lacks feathers 

 on the tarsus. It seems to be confined to the Islands of Mauritius and 

 Bourbon, for although several times accredited to Madagascar its 

 occurrence there remains to be confirmed; and all the East Indian 

 records belong to other subspecies.

brownish white — almost pure white — band on the rump, its feathers 

 with slightly though not very noticeably dusky shafts; sides of head 

 clove brown, the lores darker, with white bases ; sides of neck somewhat 

 lighter brown; lower surface brownish gray, darkest on chin and the 

 longest lower tail-coverts, decidedly paler, even almost whitish, on 

 lower abdomen and anal region; lining of wing clove brown. 



From Collocalia francica spodiopygia, to which this form has hereto- 

 fore been referred, it differs in considerably more greenish glossy upper 

 surface, much more whitish rump, and paler posterior lower parts. 

 It has the most whitish rump of any subspecies of C. francica, and 

 seems furthermore to be one of the best marked of these. It is another 

 of the novelties brought back by Mr. C. H. Townsend from his Pacific 

 cruise in 1899-1900, and was obtained in only the Tonga group — on 

 Eua, Vavau and Nine Islands. 



Measurements of these specimens are as follows:

Chars, subsp. — Similar to Collocalia francica francica, but somewhat 

 smaller; upper surface darker; posterior lower parts more deeply 

 colored, imparting thus a more uniform appearance to the ventral 

 surface; feathers of the light rump band with more conspicuously 

 blackish shaft lines. 



Wing, 110-111; tail, 48-53; exposed culmen, 5; tarsus, 8.7-10 mm. 



Type locality. — Cardwell, Rockingham Bay, Queensland, Australia. 



Geographical distribution. — Northern Queensland and southern New 

 Guinea to Jampea Island, Ternate Island and probably also other 

 islands of the Molucca group. 



This race may be distinguished from Collocalia francica spodiopygia 

 chiefly by its much smaller size, more conspicuously blackish shaft

lines on the feathers of the light rump band, and by more glossy upper 

 surface. From Collocalia francica townsendi it differs in shorter wing, 

 less whitish rump band with conspicuous blackish shaft lines, and 

 darker abdomen. 



The subspecific separation of the present form is made principally 

 on the basis of the bird from Ternate Island, described by Count 

 Salvador! as Collocalia injuscata^^ which is certainly different from 

 both francica and spodiopygia, although considered by Dr. Hartert as 

 inseparable from the latter.^^ Although no specimens from northern 

 Queensland, the Cypselus terraereginae of Ramsay j^^have been examined 

 in the present connection, the characters of size and coloration assigned 

 them agree apparently best with this form, for which therefore terrae- 

 reginae by priority becomes the proper subspecific name. Should, 

 however, the birds from Queensland, w^hich are undoubtedly not to be 

 referred to spodiopygia, and probably not to francica, ultimately prove 

 to be different from those of the Molucca Islands, the latter must stand 

 as Collocalia francica infuscata Salvador!.

 absence, of dark shaft lines on rump and under parts. Peale's type of

 Tahiti, seems recently to have been pretty generally ignored or over- 

 looked; but that it in all probability applies to this form, as some 

 authors have indicated, notwithstanding that there is no other record 

 from Tahiti, may easily be seen by examination of the excellent orig- 

 inal description.^- It is, however, unavailable for use in the present 

 case, since it is preoccupied by Hirundo peruviana Gmelin,^^ which is 

 certainly some other bird. The Herse forsteri of Hartlaub ^* is, as he 

 states, a renaming of Forster's Hirundo peruviana, but is antedated 

 by Macropteryx spodiopygius Peale.^

Chars, subsp. — Similar to CoUocalia francica francica, but larger; 

 upper surface decidedly darker, less brownish, and with more metallic 

 greenish gloss; wings and tail with more metallic bluish and purplish 

 tinge; rump much darker, making its light band less well defined, the 

 feathers with much more distinct blackish shaft lines; lower parts, 

 particularly abdomen and crissum, darker, more uniform, and with 

 more evident dusky shaft lines.

This race may be distinguished from Collocalia f. townsendi by some- 

 what larger average size, much darker rump band with blackish shaft 

 lines more conspicuous, and decidedly more deeply colored posterior 

 lower parts, with evident darker shaft lines; from Collocalia f. terrae- 

 reg'mae by much greater size, darker rump band, and more noticeable 

 dark shaft lines on abdomen and crissum. It differs from Collocalia 

 francica spodiopygia in its somewhat greater size, more glossy upper 

 surface, more bluish and purplish metallic sheen on wings and tail, 

 presence of appreciably dusky shaft lines on the posterior lower parts,

and in duller, less well-defined rump band, the feathers of which have 

 much more conspicuous dark shaft lines. 



Birds from the southern part of the Malay Peninsula — both eastern 

 and western sides— as well as from Pulo Tioman, off the east coast, 

 average larger than those from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands; 

 but this is apparently too slight and inconstant, in the absence of any 

 accompanying color difference, to warrant recognition by name. In 

 C. f. inexpectata as in other forms there is considerable individual color 

 variation, evident in this case chiefly on the lower parts and the light 

 rump band. The single specimen of inexpectata recorded by Dr. Har- 

 tert ^^ from Amherst, Tenasserim, is possibly rather to be referred to 

 Collocalia f. germani, for it is more probably an unusually dark example 

 of the latter, whose home is near by, than a stray from the far-off south- 

 ern Andaman Islands.

 upper surface more glossed with metallic greenish; light rump band 

 with more evident blackish shaft lines; posterior lower surface darker, 

 and with more conspicuous dark shaft lines. 



Wing, 115-121.5 (average, 118.3); tail, 49-52.5 (average, 51.3);

Type locality. — Condore Island, China Sea, off the southeastern 

 coast of Cochin China. 



Geographical distribution. — Mergui Archipelago; Tenasserim; Malay 

 Peninsula south to Lower Siam; Condore Island, Cochin China; Philip-

Like many of the forms of Collocalia, this race is, on account of 

 individual variation, difficult to determine satisfactorily without a 

 sufficient series, but it is nevertheless worthy of recognition. It is 

 distinguishable from Collocalia f. spodiopygia by its lighter, more 

 greenish glossy upper surface, more metallic bluish and purplish sheen 

 on wings and tail; well-defined blackish shaft streaks on the feathers 

 of the light rump band ; paler lower parts, with dark shaft streaks on 

 abdomen; and somewhat larger size. From Collocalia f. townsendi it 

 may be separated by rather greater size; lighter, more brownish upper

parts; less whitish rump band and darker abdomen, both with more 

 distinct dusky or blackish shaft lines. From Collocalia f. terraereginae it 

 may be distinguished by its much larger size, lighter, more brownish 

 upper surface, and more conspicuous dark shaft lines on the posterior 

 lower parts. From Collocalia f. inexpectata it differs in its decidedly 

 paler under surface; lighter, more brownish upper parts; and more 

 prominent, less brownish, light rump band ;but occasional intermediate 

 individuals occur that are difficult to distinguish. The dark shaft lines 

 of the lower surface vary much in different individuals, being apparently 

 most evident in immature birds. The measurements of this form given 

 by Hartert ^^ are rather too large, as may be seen by reference to the 

 above averages, but were probably taken from a limited number of 

 specimens. A series of birds from Trong, Lower Siam, and another 

 from the Philippine archipelago seem to be identical, and together 

 are certainly all referable to this race, although a few of those from 

 Cagayan Sulu, in the southwestern Philippines, are more blackish 

 above and show in this, but not in size, some vergence toward Collocalia 

 francica terraereginae. There are examples in the United States National 

 Museum from the following islands of the Philippines: Panay; Cagayan 

 Sulu; and Cagayancillo, in the Cagayanes group. It has also been 

 recorded as Collocalia francica from Cuyo, Negros and Calamianes. 

 All Philippine records of both francica and inexpectata refer of course 

 to germani. 



The identity of Collocalia germani Oustalet and Collocalia francica 

 merguiensis Hartert may be considered as conclusively established, for 

 Dr. Hartert assures us ^^ that he has compared the types. That 

 germani is rightly considered a subspecies of Collocalia francica seems 

 to be equally certain, for Dr. R. Bowdler Sharpe, who at our request 

 carefully examined the series of merguiensis in the British Museum, 

 informs us ^*' that there is not the slightest indication of tarsal feather- 

 ing on any of the specimens.

 or bluish gloss; a pure white, well-defined rump band, the feathers of 

 which have blackish shafts and most of them dark tips; abdomen

 deeply brownish lower parts; under tail-coverts like the back; lining 

 of the wing rather more brownish.

This very distinct species differs markedly from all the preceding 

 forms with unfeathered tarsi in its small size, deeply blackish upper 

 surface, white abdomen, and peculiar white rump band. It is super- 

 ficially very similar to Collocalia leucopygia, but aside from the lack of 

 tarsal feathers is easily distinguished from that species by its more 

 greenish upper surface, broad blackish tips to the white feathers of the 

 rump band ; and more extensively blackish lower tail-coverts. There 

 is considerable variation in the wing-length of C. troglodytes, but this 

 does not seem to be correlated with different geographical areas. 



The species has been obtained on the following islands of the Philip- 

 pine archipelago: Mindanao, Palawan, Siquijor, Cebu, Masbate, Negros, 

 Guimaras, Panay, Romblon, Sibuyan, Mindoro, Luzon, Marinduque, 

 Samar, Leyte, and Ticao.

 whitish tips or margins.

This interesting bird, supposed until recently to be very rare, bids 

 fair to be found distributed pretty generally throughout the Philip- 

 pine archipelago. Up to the present time it has been ascertained to 

 occur on the following islands: Cebu, Masjjate, Luzon (McGregor), 

 Mind or o, Calayan, and Sibuyan. 



It scarcely needs close comparison with any other member of the 

 genus except Collocalia linchi, and to distinguish it from this there 

 should be no difficulty. The white margins of the brownish gray feath- 

 ers of the throat and breast are usually broad and conspicuous, but 

 occasionally in even unworn specimens are almost obsolete.

Geographical distribution. — Java ; Lombok ; Kangean Islands ; Suma- 

 tra, including the islands along its western coast; Singapore, and the 

 southern part of the Malay Peninsula; Borneo(?). 



This species is shown by the considerable amount of material from 

 various parts of its range now in the United States National Museum 

 to be divisible into several recognizable races which are diagnosed 

 below. Aside from the evident geographical variation there are some 

 differences that seem to be due to wear of the plumage and to obtain 

 alike in all the forms. The color of the upper parts changes little 

 through sex, age, or season, although there is a normal but not very 

 considerable amount of individual variation. The deep gray of the 

 anterior lower parts is decidedly more brownish when the feathers 

 become old ; and the white or whitish margins that in fresh plumage 

 are often very conspicuous on throat, breast, and under wing-coverts 

 sometimes almost entirely disappear through abrasion. Likewise the 

 broadly w^hite edgings of sides, flanks, and lower breast wear off and 

 ultimately allow much of the slate gray bases of the feathers to show, 

 in this way decidedly darkening the general appearance of the parts. 



This form of Collocalia linchi, as compared with the other sub-

species, is characterized by large size, and by very greenish upper parts, 

 inchiding wings and tail, with but slight tinge and very little or no 

 admixture of bluish. The United States National ^luseum possesses a 

 fair series from Sikakap Strait, North Pagi Island, off the western coast 

 of Sumatra ; and a specimen from Singapore is also identical. Borneo is 

 doubtfully included in the range of this race, as we have examined no 

 specimens from that island, and its bird may be like that of either the 

 Natuna Islands or even the Philippines, or may prove to be an endemic 

 form. 

 Measurements of Collocalia linchi linchi are as follows : 



CoUooalia linchi cyanoptila subsp. nov. 



Chars, subsp. — Similar to Collocalia linchi linchi, with which it 

 agrees in size, but upper surface of head and body much more bluish 

 in shade, and with considerable admixture of bluish purple; wings, 

 and particularly the tail, decidedly more bluish. 



Geographical distribution. — Natuna Islands and Linga Island. 



Description.— Type, adult female. No. 174,688, U. S. N. M.; Bung- 

 uran Island, Natuna Islands, July 1, 1900; Dr. W. L. Abbott. Upper 

 parts metallic dark bluish green, much mixed with bluish purple, 

 most noticeably so on posterior portion; tail bluish green decidedly 

 tinged with purplish; wings sepia brown, dull metallic purplish on 

 most of their exposed portions, the coverts more brightly colored, and 

 mixed with dark green; sides of head and neck, throat, breast, flanks, 

 and sides of body brownish slate, the feathers of the lores with cottony 

 white bases, those of throat and breast with inconspicuous pale gray or 

 whitish tips, those of lower breast, sides, and flanks broadly margined 

 and terminated with white; median portion of abdomen white with 

 some narrow slaty shaft streaks; lower tail-coverts dark bluish metallic 

 green, the longer ones immaculate, the shorter ones margined with 

 white; lining of wing dull dark metallic green.

This new race is quite different from true Collocalia linchi, the only 

 form of the species with which it agrees in size, and it may readily be 

 distinguished on even superficial comparison by the difference in the 

 color of the upper parts. The best and most uniform character is the 

 always much more bluish or purplish color of the upper surface of the 

 tail. A single adult male from Linga Island, southeast of Singapore, 

 is intermediate between cyanoptila and linchi; but there is so much 

 purplish and bluish in the color of the upper parts, and the tail is so 

 nearly like that of cyanoptila, that the specimen must apparently be 

 referred to the latter, although this island is far from the Natuna 

 group, and in a location where linchi is the form we should naturally 

 expect to find. Further examples from Linga may, however, show 

 that the average characters of the bird found there will place it with 

 linchi. 



Measurements of the adults of Collocalia linchi cyanoptila are as 

 follows : 



Collocalia linchi affinis Beavan. 



Collocalia affinis Beavan, Ibis, 1867, p. 318 (ex Tytler MS.).

 smaller. 



Type locality. — Port Blair, South Andaman Island, Andaman 

 Islands. 



GeograpJiical distribution. — Andaman and Nicobar Islands. 



This form, long ago described from the southern Andaman Islands 

 by Beavan, has hitherto usually been considered the same as linchi. 

 The satisfactory series obtained by Dr. W. L. Abbott in the Nicobar 

 Islands, however, now conclusively establishes its claim to recognition. 

 It differs from true linchi in its much smaller size, and the decidedly 

 bluish or purplish shade of the upper surface, particularly the tail- 

 coverts and tail.

Chars, subsp. — Similar to Collocalia linchi affinis, but more greenish 

 on all the upper parts, particularly on back, wings, and tail. 



Geographical distribution. — Islands of the Mergui Archipelago. 



Description.— Type, adult male. No. 173,028, U. S. N. M.; Bentinck 

 Island, Mergui Archipelago, March 9, 1900; Dr. W. L. Abbott. Upper 

 parts deep metallic green, with an appreciable bluish purple tinge, 

 particularly on the upper tail-coverts ; tail the same, but more bluish ; 

 wings fuscous, the exposed portion of quills and primary coverts with 

 a dull metallic purplish sheen, the other superior coverts like the back; 

 lores dark brown, the feathers with pure white bases; rest of sides of 

 head and neck, with chin, throat, and breast, dull brownish slate color, 

 the feathers of the throat and upper breast with pale grayish or whitish 

 tips; lower breast, sides, and flanks brownish slate with a slight metallic 

 greenish sheen, the feathers all broadly margined with white which 

 much obscures the darker color ; middle of abdomen white with shaft 

 markings of dusky; exposed portions of lower tail-coverts dark metallic 

 greenish, the shortest brownish, all but the longest broadly bordered 

 with white; lining of wing dark brown, glossed with metallic green. 

 "Bill black; iris dark brown; feet dark fleshy brown." 



This race is of course intermediate between Collocalia linchi affinis, 

 from the Andaman Islands, and Collocalia I. isonota,'"' from the Philip- 

 pines; but the differences that characterize it are readily appreciable 

 in a series, as well as in a large proportion of individual speci- 

 mens, and seem, particularly when its isolated range is taken into 

 account, quite sufficient for its recognition by name. It is readily dis- 

 tinguishable from true linchi by reason of its much inferior dimensions

and more bluish or purplish upper parts, especially wings and tail; 

 from cyanoptila by its small size and more greenish upper surface, 

 including wings and tail. So far as known it does not occur outside 

 the Mergui Archipelago, where it has been taken on only Bentinck 

 Island; but it undoubtedly is to be found on other islands of the 

 group, while there would seem to be no improbability of its occasional 

 if not regular occvirrence on the adjacent mainland. 

 Measurements are subjoined:

 Benguet, Luzon, Philippine Islands, June 3, 1903; R. C. McGregor 

 and A. Celestino. Upper sm-face dull, dark, metallic green, the 

 crown and upper tail-coverts with a slight bluish tinge; tail of the 

 same color, scarcely more bluish; wings fuscous, the exposed surface 

 of the quills dull greenish blue with but little metallic sheen, the supe- 

 rior coverts like the back; lores dark brown, the feathers with pure 

 white bases; sides of head and neck, chin, throat, breast, sides, and 

 flanks brownish slate color, the throat and breast feathers with margins 

 of pale grayish or whitish, those of lower breast, of sides and flanks 

 so broadly bordered with white that the ground color is largely over- 

 laid; median portion of abdomen white, with very fine dusky shaft 

 lines; longest lower tail-coverts dull, dark, metallic green, slightly or 

 not at all margined with whitish, the shorter ones brownish with 

 ample white edges, or nearly all white with a dusky shaft-stripe; lining 

 of wing dark brown, slightly glossed with metallic greenish. 



This race differs from CoUocalia linchi linchi in its smaller size and

much duller, slightly more bluish upper parts ; from C. I. cyanoptila in 

 inferior size and much duller, more greenish upper surface; and from 

 C. I. affinis in somewhat longer wing, slightly shorter tail, and decidedly 

 duller, more greenish upper parts, particularly the tail. 



Birds in juvenal plumage, even before their wings and tails are fully 

 grown, seem to be exactly like the adults in color above, and not ap- 

 preciably different below except for possibly broader, more evident 

 white margins on lower breast, sides, flanks, and lining of wing. 



This form of Collocalia linchi appears to be confined to the Philip- 

 pine archipelago, and has been taken on only Luzon, Mindoro, Min- 

 danao, and Bongao.

on sides of head, the feathers of lores with pure white bases, those of 

 middle of lower throat and breast slightly, of the sides and flanks more 

 or less broadly, margined with whitish; centre of abdomen white; lower 

 tail-coverts dusky with a slight greenish gloss, the longest ones nar- 

 rowly, the shorter ones conspicuously edged all around with white, 

 some of the shortest entirely white save for a narrow dusky shaft line ; 

 under wing-coverts blackish with the dull oil-green gloss of the upper 

 surface; a few of the dark brown axillars tipped with white. 



This remarkably distinct species continues to be known from only 

 the type specimen, which was obtained by Messrs. Goss and Dodge 

 during their recent expedition to Mount Kina Balu. This example 

 is fully adult and in perfect plumage. 



By reason of its white abdomen, uniform greenish upper parts, with 

 lack of any white on the rump and also of white markings on the tail, 

 Collocalia dodgei needs special comparison with none of its congeners 

 unless it be C. linchi. From the typical form of the latter species it 

 differs even more than from C. I. isonota, the one to which it seems to 

 be most closely allied, but from which, however, it is specifically dis- 

 tinct. Whether the previous records of Collocalia linchi from ]\Iount 

 Kina Balu and from other parts of Borneo belong to this newly de- 

 scribed species or to some form of linchi we are unable with our pre- 

 sent material to determine, and this will be an interesting question for 

 future investigation.

In the specimens from Timor examined the upper parts are dull 

 grayish metallic green, the wings and tail slightly more bluish; the 

 anterior lower parts, including the breast, brownish gray, the feathers 

 tipped with grayish white, producing a mottled appearance, the middle 

 of the breast and jugulum having most white, the chin scarcely any; 

 abdomen nearly pure white; feathers of the sides with brownish gray 

 centres and whitish margins much like the breast; lining of wing dark 

 brown slightly mixed with whitish. 



Judging from Dr. Hartert's remarks,^^ birds of this species from 

 Timor are not just like those on the neighboring islands, and the latter 

 may as he suggests be subspecifically separable. This species is very 

 different from all members of the genus excepting CoUocalia natalis 

 and C. esculenta, and may easily be distinguished by its dull greenish 

 upper parts combined with white-spotted tail-feathers. It is of course 

 near CoUocalia esculenta, but apparently quite distinct enough to stand 

 as a species, although Dr. Hartert is of opposite opinion.*^

The shell is rounded-cuneate, the valves rather thick and strong, 

 inequilateral, the posterior outline being longer and subangular, the 

 anterior end rounded. The posterior dorsal slope is flat, and the 

 beaks project well above the dorsal outline of the valve-edges. The 



specimens are worn and without cuticle, white in the middle and ante- 

 riorly, pinkish orange near the posterior end. Sculpture of about 17 

 low rounded radial ribs parted by narrower intervals, and about six 

 strong broad but unequal concentric waves separated by deep con- 

 strictions. 



The waves and radial ribs are weak near the anterior end, and 

 wanting on the flat posterior slope. The hinge-line is very strongly 

 curved, the two sides at an angle of about 90 degrees to each other. 

 The hinge-plate is moderately wide, with 12 anterior and 11 posterior 

 teeth, three or four near the middle being very small and somewhat 

 irregular. There is a small triangular area or lozenge below the beaks, 

 sculptured en chevron with about six widely diverging grooves. The 

 basal margin is coarsely crenulate inside in correspondence with the 

 external ribs, and the concentric waves of the exterior are very weakly 

 indicated inside.

ON HAWAIIAN SPECIES OF SPHYRADITIM. 



BY HENRY A. PILSBRY AND C. M. COOKE, JR. 



The genus Sphyradium occurs over practically the whole Palsearctic 

 and Nearctic realms, with one species in the Neotropical, but it has not 

 hitherto been reported from Polynesia. The two Hawaiian species to 

 be described below have all the shell characters of the genus, but since 

 the jaw and teeth of neither is known, their reference to Sphyradium 

 is provisional. 



Sphyradium sharpi P. and C, n. sp. Figs. 1, 2. 



The shell is narrowly umbilicate, tapering-cylindric, the summit 

 obtusely conic; thin; chestnut brown, paler near the apex, the surface 

 somewhat shining and distinctly but not closely striate. Whorls 

 slightly over 5, quite convex, the suture deeply impressed. The aper- 

 ture is strongly oblique, rounded lunate. Peristome thin and simple, 

 the basal and outer margins well arched ; columella vertical with broadly 

 dilated edge. The insertions of the lips are remote. The umbilicus 

 is circular and deep. Length 1.8, diam. 1.36 mm.

ADDITIONAL NEW SPECIES OF POLYCH^TA FROM THE NORTH PACIFIC. 



BY J. PERCY MOORE. 



In the following pages are described a number of new species of 

 Polychaeta, belonging to several families, from the collections of the 

 Alaskan Salmon Commission of 1903. Three papers noticing other 

 novelties in these collections have already been published in these 

 Proceedings with the approval of the Commissioner of Fisheries, 

 through whose kindness the material was placed in my hands for study. 

 The full report on all of the species represented will appear in the 

 Bureau of Fisheries Bulletin. 



Notophyllum imbricatum sp. nov. Plate X, figs. 1-3. 



The two examples upon which this species is founded bear a re- 

 markable resemblance in proportions and general aspect to a Polynoe. 

 The body is depressed and the large, scale-like notopodial cirri are 

 imbricated and, except for a short space near the anterior end, com- 

 pletely conceal the back from above. 



The type and larger specimen is a trifle over 30 mm. long, and the 

 greatest width between tips of the parapodia a little anterior to the 

 middle of the body is 6.5 mm. The small individual is 12 mm. long 

 and 1.8 mm. wide, and the back is concealed by the elytra even more 

 completely than in the larger one. 



The prostomium is flattened and wedge-shaped, with the slightly 

 concave or straight base about two-thirds of the length, and the 

 angles rounded. A slight emargination of the anterior portion of the 

 sides is filled by an irregular low tubercle from which the frontal cirri 

 arise. A pair of large brown eyes occupy the greater part of the 

 posterior region of the prostomium laterad of the median tentacle 



(fig. !)• 



The frontal tentacles arise in lateral and ventral pairs, the latter 

 slightly in advance, from the slight emargination above mentioned. 

 They nearly equal the prostomium in length, are stout and somewhat 

 swollen above the base, and taper to fine tips. The median tentacle 

 arises between the eyes and nearly fills this space. It is one and one- 

 half times as long as the prostomium, stout and somewhat enlarged 




218 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



above the base and tapers to a slender end. From behind its base a 

 low ridge runs to the posterior margin of the prostomium. In both 

 specimens the proboscis is retracted and the large mouth is bounded 

 by a rather prominent lip, formed by the union of the peristomium 

 with the succeeding somite. 



The peristomium and two succeeding segments are much crowded 

 forward so that the tentacular cirri arise beneath the head. The first 

 or peristomial cirrus is a ventral cirrus and arises from the forwardly 

 directed portion of the peristomium beneath the eye. It resembles 

 the median cephalic tentacle in form and size, but is a trifle longer and 

 arises from a distinct basal article. Arising from beneath the pos- 

 terior dorsal margin of the prostomium, apparently from the peristo- 

 mium, are three somewhat flattened appendages on each side, the outer- 

 most of which is the longest and connected with the corresponding 

 tentacular cirrus by a slight web. The middle one is nearly as long, 

 and the inner one is minute (fig. 1). 



Somite II bears two pairs of tentacular cirri, a dorsal and a ventral 

 one, separated by a considerable interval in which arises a small 

 papilla probably representing a parapodium. The ventral cirrus 

 occupies a position below the peristomial cirrus, which it resembles, 

 but which it exceeds decidedly in both length and thickness. The 

 dorsal cirrus of this somite arises at a higher level than any others in 

 the body from beneath the postero-lateral angle of the prostomium, 

 and its rather stout but long and tapering style reaches to IX or X. 

 Somite III bears a dorsal tentacular cirrus only, which, with the com- 

 plete parapodium to which it belongs, is depressed to a position more 

 ventral than usual, in marked contrast to the dorsal cirrus of II. It 

 arises from beneath and slightly behind the latter, which it resembles 

 in form and size (fig. 1). 



As stated before, the first three somites are carried well forward, 

 the peristomium and II being coalesced ventrally but distinct, though 

 very short, above. Remaining somites are well differentiated and 

 obscurely biannular, the anterior and decidedly larger annulus bearing 

 the parapodia. There are about 78 somites, the posterior end of the 

 body being in a state of regeneration and the somites of that region as 

 a consequence very small and tapered to a minvite pygidium. 



The body, excluding the parapodia, is slender, about two-fifths of 

 the total width, and of nearly uniform diameter, except near the taper- 

 ing ends. It is somewhat arched dorsally ; flattened and with a shallow 

 neural groove below. 



Parapodia (fig. 2) are prominent and well developed throughout. 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 219 



In the middle region they exceed one-fourth of the entire width. They 

 consist of a broad base, a somewhat flattened, tongue-shaped neuro- 

 podium, slightly cleft at the tip and bearing a rounded and swollen 

 prominence on the ventral side of its base, and a minute papilliform 

 notopodium, which diverges dorsally from the neuropodium. Each 

 division is supported by a single aciculus, the notopodial being very 

 slender and curved, the neuropodial stouter and straight. 



Along the posterior face of the base of the neuropodium above the 

 papilla mentioned arises a flange-like ceratophore bearing a large, 

 foliaceous palette-shaped ventral cirrus which curves upward behind 

 the neuropodium and completely conceals both it and its setae from 

 behind. The notopodial ceratophore is very large, causing the 

 notopodium itself to appear as a mere appendage. At its dorsal side 

 the free distal border is prominently produced, thus prolonging the 

 surface of attachment of the notopodial cirrus. The cirrus itself is 

 very prominent, of a somew^hat irregular reniform outline and attached 

 by the marginal sinus. All of the notopodial cirri are turned nearly 

 horizontally and overlap on the back in an imbricate fashion, closely 

 similar to the elytra of the Polynoidoe. Anteriorly the dorsal cirri 

 diminish in size so that they fail to cover the back completely and 

 their ceratophores become more slender and elevated. The ventral 

 cirri also become smaller, but remain prominent as far forward as III 

 without essential change of form or position. A minute neuropodial 

 tubercle exists on II, but it is uncertain if setae are present thereon. 



The eyes are purplish brown and the general color of the body a 

 distinct dull greenish olive. Little pigment remains in any part of the 

 body, but the notopodial cirri are more or less marked wdth dusky 

 streaks and spots. A few small ova float free in the body cavity. 



The notopodium usually bears but a single slender, curved and 

 simple seta, and even this appears to be absent from several of the 

 anterior parapodia. Neuropodial setae are numerous, upwards of 20 

 to 30 occurring in the subacicular and 12 to 18 in the supraacicular 

 groups. They are colorless and transparent, compound, with the 

 stem gently curved and slightly enlarged at the end, where each side 

 of the socket is provided with 6 to 8 very long, slender teeth and several 

 shorter ones. The blade is slightly curved and tapers to an acute tip, 

 and is striated and provided with minute marginal denticulations 

 (fig. 3). 



The only specimens are the two from Station 4,269, Afoqnak Bay, 

 14 to 19 fathoms, hard gray sand and rocks. 




220 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



Eulalia quadrioculata sp. nov. Plate X, figs. 4-6. 



This description is based upon a single much contracted entire 

 specimen (type) and a fragment of the anterior end of another in every- 

 way similar. 



The type is 27 mm. long, the protruded proboscis 2 mm. additional, 

 the width without parapodia 2 mm., with parapodia 3 mm., the diameter 

 of the distal end of the proboscis 2.5 mm., and the number of segments 

 106. 



The evidently much contracted prostomium (fig. 4) is about two- 

 thirds as long as wide, scarcely emarginated in the median line pos- 

 teriorly, rather tumid in the posterior lateral part and then slightly 

 concave to a small truncate median anterior lobe. The usual pair of 

 eyes are transversely elliptical, situated on the dorsal surface of the 

 prostomium about three times their diameter apart, nearly twice their 

 diameter from the lateral margins of the head and not more than 

 their diameter from the posterior margin. They have distinct lenses. 

 In nearly the same transverse line or very slightly in advance and half 

 way between the dorsal eyes and the margin, or just within the nuchal 

 organs, is a second pair of eye-like spots of black pigment, but lenseless 

 and smaller and more irregular than the dorsal eyes. 



The four frontal tentacles are subequal, about as long as the head, 

 and rather thick, with acute tips. The ventral pair project somewhat 

 downwards, the dorsal directly outwards. From the middle of the 

 small lobe lying between the frontal tentacles a shallow longitudinal 

 groove passes to the median tentacle, which arises from a point just 

 anterior to the eyes. It equals the frontal tentacles in length, but is 

 slightly more slender in its distal part. The four tentacular cirri arise 

 in the positions usual in the genus from somites I, II and III, and are 

 short and subequal, being about twice the length of the prostomium. 



The segments are all well differentiated and dorsally are strongly 

 arched; anteriorly they are strictly simple smooth rings, but in the 

 posterior third become biannulate. Ventrally the body is marked by 

 a neural groove and lateral ridges bearing glandular areas ventral to 

 the parapodia. On this surface the biannulation extends nearly to the 

 anterior end. The anterior segments are contracted and extremely 

 short, farther back they become relatively longer, and toward the 

 posterior end the body is distinctly flattened. The pygidium, which 

 is provided with a thickened welt-like rim surrounding the anus, 

 bears on the ventral side a pair of prominent acuminate cirri resembling 

 the ventral cirri in size. 



Parapodia are located at the level of the ventral surface. That on 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 221 



II, related to the second tentacular cirrus, is rudimentary and achae- 

 tous ; that on III is larger, perfectly formed and bears setse. The others 

 have the form shown in fig. 5 and bear foliaceous dorsal cirri. When 

 fully developed they are sharply marked off from the ventral glandular 

 swellings by distinct lateral grooves. The notopodium is of course 

 wanting, and the neuropodium is a small somewhat flattened process 

 divided distally into a very small postsetal and a decidedly longer 

 presetal lobe, from between which the single vertical series of setae 

 projects. Each lobe is notched on the edge at the point where the 

 single .straight slender aciculum reaches the surface. The neuropodial 

 cirrus is prominent from III back and is a short, rather thick process 

 attached to the posterior side of the base of the neuropodium. In 

 the middle region it is somewhat foliaceous and reaches to the tip of 

 the neuropodium; in form it is triangular with the broad, somewhat 

 convex base ventral and the apex dorsal, while the attachment is by 

 one of the short sides. Posteriorly they become more slender and 

 project distinctly beyond the end of the neuropodium. 



The dorsal cirri (fig, 5) are prominent and foliaceous throughout. 

 They arise from stout bases situated a short distance dorsal to the 

 neuropodia, which they in most cases exceed in size. All of the cirri 

 have their fibrous and glandular structures arranged pinnately along 

 an axial core. Anteriorly the cirri are rather broadly lanceolate with 

 acuminate, somewhat recurved tips; posteriorly they become more 

 slender and elongated; and finally are very narrowly lanceolate and 

 of a length exceeding the diameter of the body. At the same time 

 their foliaceous character is gradually lost. 



About thirty setae, equally divided between the supraacicular and 

 subacicular groups, form the vertical fan-like fascicle. They are of 

 the usual compound form (fig. 6) with the transparent, colorless stems 

 rather stouter than those of E^ longicornuta, the thickened and nearly 

 truncate end furnished on each side with seven or eight slender teeth, 

 one of which is much larger than the others. The blades are short, 

 broad at the base, and rather conspicuously striated and fringed. 



The type specimen, a female filled with large eggs, retains a dull olive 

 color throughout the l^ody, becoming brown on the dorsal cirri. Be- 

 sides the black pigment in the eyes, there is a diffuse spot near the tip 

 of each dorsal cirrus, and a very minute spot beneath each ganglion 

 of the ventral chain. The cotype shows some indications of a faint 

 transverse band across the dorsum of each segment. 



The type and cotype are from Quarantine Rock, Port Townsend, 

 Washington, June 27, 1903. 




222 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [ApHl^ 



Eulalia longicornuta sp. nov. Plate X, figs. 7, 8. 



A complete example, much contracted, measures 15 mm. in length, 

 with a body width of 1.5 mm. at the widest part, and a total of 73 

 segments. 



The broad prostomium is very slightly cordate, about as wide as 

 long, and has no distinct concavity or constriction behind the frontal 

 tentacles. The latter arise from the extreme anterior end of the 

 prostomium, are slightly longer than the head and very slender. The 

 median tentacle arises immediately in front of a line connecting the 

 anterior border of the eyes or very close to the centre of the 

 prostomium. It is If times as long as the head, very slender, and 

 tapers regularly from the base to the tip. 



The single pair of eyes are circular, black, situated nearly their 

 diameter from the posterior margin of the prostomium and twice 

 their diameter from each other. Both specimens have the proboscis 

 retracted, in which condition the mouth is bounded below by a some- 

 what swollen, longitudinally furrowed lip. The peristomial somite 

 appears on the dorsum as a slightly elevated lenticular area overlapping 

 the prostomium. The first ventral tentacular cirrus arises directly 

 beneath the eye, the second one from somite II ; both are slender and 

 subulate and reach back to somite VII or to a length 2+ times the 

 head. The two dorsal tentacular cirri arise from II and III respect- 

 ively, and are about twice the length of the ventral cirrus, very slender 

 and regularly tapered to a delicate tip. 



Dorsally the body is strongly arched above, below flattened and 

 slightly grooved. It is widest at the middle and tapers regularly and 

 nearly equally both ways. The segments are well marked throughout 

 and show scarcely a trace of biannulation, even posteriorly. The 

 anal cirri are missing from both type and cotype. 



Although the specimens are smaller, the parapodia (fig. 7) are even 

 more prominent than in E. quadrioculata, owing to the projecting 

 character of the dorsal angle of the presetal lobe, but otherwise they 

 are similar. The dorsal cirri are, however, very different from those 

 of that species, being folded against the sides of the body instead of 

 held erect. They are strongly fohaceous throughout, the anterior 

 and middle ones having a broadly pyriform outline, and those of the 

 latter region being especially broad ; the posterior ones are more slender 

 and rather cuneate-ovate. Moreover, the central area is always broad 

 and thick and the gland ducts and other markings radiate from it in 

 all directions and not in a pinnate manner. The ventral cirrus is also 

 prominent and projects beyond the dorsal lobe of the parapodium. 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 223 



There are about 10 supraacicular and 12 subacicular setae in all, but 

 fewer on the extreme anterior and posterior parapodia and, except 

 for the usual variations in relative length of the blade, all have the 

 form exhibited in fig. 8. The slender stem ends in an acutely oblique 

 enlargement with 7 to 9 nearly equal, closely appressed teeth on each 

 side. The blades are slender, flexible and very acute, with very fine 

 marginal fringe. 



In both specimens the color has faded to a nearly uniform olive with 

 some brown striations on the dorsal cirri. The type is a female filled 

 with eggs. These specimens were found among serpulid tubes taken 

 at the Quarantine Station dock near Port Townsend, Washington, on 

 June 27, 1903. 

 Pionosyllis magnifica sp. nov. Plate X, figs. 9-11. 



This large syllid is described from two specimens, one of which (the 

 type) measures 48 mm. long and nearly 2 mm. wide, exclusive of cirri 

 and setae, in the middle of the body. The form is much depressed,, 

 especially in the widened middle region, from which it tapers to the 

 very small head and pygidium. 



As just indicated the prostomium is small, its width little exceeding 

 three-fifths of the width of the second segment and one-fifth of the 

 maximum breadth of the body. It is depressed, somewhat quad- 

 rangular in form, widest anteriorly where the width is about double 

 the length. The somewhat flattened palpi project forward and some- 

 what downward and are very slightly connate at the base (fig. 9). 



All three of the cephalic cirri are decidedly slender and arise in a 

 transverse row from almost the extreme anterior margin of the prosto- 

 mium. In one specimen they are subequal and about three times the 

 length of the prostomium. In the other the median one is three and 

 one-half times, the lateral about twice the prostomial length. The 

 ends may be partly sloughed away. 



The eyes, though small, are very conspicuous and nearly black, the 

 anterior slightly the larger. Together they form a quadrate figure 

 conforming to the outline of the head and about two-thirds as large. 



Dorsally the peristomium is very short, but ventrally it projects as 

 a prominent lip surrounding the large mouth. A fragment of the 

 anterior end of an example of this species from Station 4,235 has the 

 proboscis protruded as a short bell-shaped structure, bearing ten 

 prominent papillae at the end and just behind them a conical, dorsal 

 median tooth which appears to be quite soft. On the roof of the 

 pharynx just behind the everted portion there appears to be, however, 

 a hardened, horny elliptical area. This specimen also has the eyes. 




224 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



larger than the others and nearly connate, but no swimming setae 

 exist on any of the small number of anterior segments present. 



Of the tentacular cirri (fig. 9) the dorsal peristomial is about four 

 times as long as the prostomium, that of somite II is slightly longer 

 and of III as much shorter ; the ventral peristomial cirrus is about two 

 and one-half times the prostomial length. All of the tentacular cirri 

 resemble the cephalic cirri in being slender, delicate, and not monili- 

 form, or with indistinct irregular furrows only. 



After the second, the segments increase very gradually in length 

 and more rapidly in width and soon assume the depressed form char- 

 acterizing the middle region where they are five or six times as wide as 

 long. The type specimen has about 150 somites, the cotype only 

 110. Posteriorly the body becomes slender and ends in a minute 

 annular pygidium, bearing on its ventral side a pair of very slender 

 caudal cirri equalling the last twelve segments and exceeding any of 

 the cephalic appendages. 



> The parapodia are of the form usual in Syllidse and project promi- 

 nently from the sides at a low level. Although there is no distinct 

 notopodium, a slender notopodial aciculus is always present just be- 

 neath the notopodial cirrophore (fig. 10). The well-developed neu- 

 ropodium terminates in a broadly rounded, more dorsal, postsetal 

 process and a longer, rather prominent, and more ventral presetal 

 process. The three or four aciculi terminate at the upper outer angle 

 of the former. Ventral cirri are always short, stout and bluntly 

 rounded, with oblique bases passing into the ventral surface of the 

 body, and in size about equal the neuropodia. Notopodial cirri arise 

 from very large and prominent cirrophores. Except for their slightly 

 larger size anteriorly, where they are about three times the length of 

 the prostomium, the notopodial styles are similar throughout. They 

 are probably somewhat contracted and in life would be longer and more 

 slender. In the middle of the body they are scarcely one-half of the 

 total width. As shown in the figm-e they are rather stout and coarse, 

 and, though more or less deeply marked wdth irregular transverse fur- 

 rows, are never regularly articulated or moniliform. The only varia- 

 tion in the parapodia is that they become more prominent in all their 

 parts posteriorly. 



Notopodial aciculi are slender, curved and acutely pointed; the 

 neuropodial are stouter, nearly straight and knobbed at the end. All 

 setae (fig. 11) are compound and all are subacicular in position. In 

 middle parapodia they are numerous, arranged in about ten horizontal 

 rows of three to five each, or about forty in all. They are colorless. 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 225 



with long, slender, curved shafts, the ends of which are rather abruptly 

 enlarged and not very oblique, and are provided with only a few small 

 teeth at the apex. The appendages or blades are strongly hooked and 

 bifid at the end and distinctly fringed. The shortest posterior ones 

 have a length of about one and one-third times the diameter of the end 

 of the shaft, the longest about four and one-half times that diameter. 



Both specimens are entirely colorless and the large one is filled with 

 masses of sperm. 



The type comes from Admiralty Inlet, near Port Townsend, Wash- 

 ington, Station 4,219, 16 to 26 fathoms, on a bottom of green mud with 

 sand and broken shells. A fragment was taken at Yes Ba}^, Behm 

 Canal, 130 to 193 fathoms, bottom of gray mud. 



Stauronereis annulatus sp. nov. Plate X, figs. 12, 13, and Plate XI, figs. 18-22. 



The larger example (much contracted) is 13 mm. long and about 1 

 mm. wide exclusive of the setse, and has 72 segments. The other is 9 

 mm. long with 62 segments. 



The prostomium (fig. 12) consists of a broad shovel-like anterior 

 process and two short segments, each bearing a pair of tentacles and a 

 pair of eyes. Although these two divisions or rings are about equal, 

 both the eyes and tentacles of the anterior one are much the larger. 

 The anterior tentacles (palpi) arise from the ventro-lateral region of 

 the first annulus. Each consists of a large and very stout basal piece 

 strongly curved backwards by the sides of the head and bearing on its 

 end a very small ellipsoidal terminal article. Just above the base of 

 each, on the dorso-lateral region of the head, is a large very dark brown 

 eye. Immediately behind and slightly above the large eyes the second 

 pair of tentacles are borne on the second annulus. They are about as 

 long but not so stout as the anterior ones, are cylindrical in form and 

 consist of six or seven nearly spherical articles. The second pair of 

 eyes are minute dark brown spots about one-fifth the diameter of the 

 anterior pair, and are situated on the dorsum of the second annulus 

 about half as far apart as the anterior pair. The mouth is small and 

 bounded behind by the second somite, and from it project the ends of the 

 jaws (fig. 18). Owing to the retracted state of the proboscis the jaw 

 apparatus is not all visible. A specimen cleared in glycerine shows 

 on the dorsal side a lenticular area having a very dark brown border 

 and a paler interior enclosing a small central space. In ventral view 

 are seen the pair of dark brown mandibles (fig. 18) with slender bowed 

 bases and curved, divergent, tapering end-plates bearing about seven 

 strong teeth along the medial margin.

226 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



The prostomium and somite II are apodoiis, short simple rings. 

 All others bear parapodia, but are not otherwise more complicated in 

 structure. Up to about the fifteenth they increase in size, but remain 

 uniannular throughout. The body is strongly arched above and 

 nearly flat below, and terminates in a simple ring-like pygidium bear- 

 ing a pair of small ventral anal cirri as long as the diameter of the 

 pygidium. 



Parapodia'are small, slender and strictly lateral in position. Except 

 that they correspond in size with the segment bearing them and are 

 consequently largest at the middle of the body, they are quite similar 

 throughout. The neuropodium (fig. 13) is slender, nearly cylindrical 

 and slightly enlarged distally, where it terminates in a presetal lobe 

 divided into a larger ventral and a minute acicular process, and a 

 postsetal lobe which begins just below the aciculum and runs to a 

 rather prominent dorsal angle. Its dorsal surface bears a group of 

 long cilia. The neuropodial cirrus is a simple finger-like papilla arising 

 in or near the distal third of the ventro-posterior siu"face of the 

 neuropodium and reaching nearly to the end of the latter. 



The dorsal cirrus arises immediately above the base of the neuro- 

 podium and consists of a slender, elongated cirrophore nearly as long 

 as the latter and slightly diverging from it. Usually but not always 

 it is slightly constricted about the middle and the end is a little thick- 

 ened. Probably it represents the notopodium, as what appears to be 

 a slender aciculus penetrates about half of its length. A tuft of long 

 cilia resembling that on the dorsal surface of the neuropodium is 

 usually present on its ventral and sometimes on its dorsal surface also. 

 On the end of this basal piece is borne a terminal style of about half 

 its length and of a slender, conical form. The first parapodium 

 altogether lacks a dorsal cirrus. 



Setse are numerous and of four forms, all very delicate, transparent 

 and colorless. They are arranged in well differentiated supra- and 

 subacicular fascicles, each comprising two kinds, and'all of which occur 

 throughout the body, except perhaps in a few anterior segments, where 

 the long compound setse have not been found. 



All of the supraacicular setae are simple ; those most numerous being 

 very delicate but stiff capillary bristles, tapered to very acute tips, 

 slightly curved and rather strongly serrated in an antrorse manner 

 along one side (fig. 20). Their exposed parts are fully three times as 

 long as the entire neuropodium. The other form has generally stouter 

 stems, straight and tapering until near the end (fig. 19), where they 

 present a gentle ventral curvature and at the same time become 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA, 227 



broadened and end in two divergent, slightly curved points, the ventral 

 of which is the longer; w^hile below the dorsal is a serrated sheath, the 

 rather coarse teeth of which are directed outward. Seldom more than 

 three or four of the latter form occur in a parapodium along with ten or 

 fifteen of the former, 



Subacicular sets are all compound. The most numerous kind 

 occur to the number of about fifteen. They have moderately stout, 

 rather strongly curved stems, the end being very unequally and 

 obliquely bifurcated to form a socket, the dorsal border of which is 

 provided with a few teeth (fig. 20), while the blades are comparatively 

 short, but increase in length from the ventral to the dorsal margin of 

 the bundle, and have one border fringed and the end terminated by a 

 pair of distinct but not widely separated and nearly parallel teeth. 

 The second kind of compound setse (fig. 22) seldom exceeds three in 

 numl^er. They have the same construction as the more numerous 

 form but are much more slender and delicate in all their parts, and the 

 blade often equals the entire length of the neuropodium or about three 

 times the length of the longest blades of the other type. On the most 

 anterior segments the two forms appear to grade into each other. 

 The setse of this species differ decidedly from those of typical members 

 of the genus and are more nearly like those of Prionognathus ciliatus 

 Keferstein. 



These worms are quite colorless and their form and histological 

 structure indicates that they may be pelagic in habit. 



The type and a somewhat smaller cotype were obtained at Quaran- 

 tine Rock, Port Townsend, Washington, June 27, 1903. 



Notomastus giganteus. Plate X, figs. 24, 25. 



The only complete specimen measures 140 mm. in length and 7 mm., 

 in maximum diameter in the thoracic region, but a second incomplete 

 example is much larger. Even taking into account the contracted 

 state of the specimens, this species is much stouter than usual for the 

 genus. The body is nearly terete or slightly depressed and for the 

 first fifteen or twenty millimeters increases in diameter, and then falls 

 off to the posterior end which is two millimeters in diameter within 

 ten segments of the anus. 



The prostomium is a small rounded lobe bearing a minute conical 

 palpode and is completely retracted within the peristomium, which, 

 except in being slightly longer, resembles the immediately following 

 segments. The protruded and collapsed proboscis "forms a discoid, 

 wrinkled structure fully 8 mm. in diameter. All of the thoracic seg- 




228 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



ments are strongly biannulate, the anterior annulus being slightly 

 shorter than the posterior. Each annulus is marked out in irregular 

 areas, of which there is generally but one series to each annulus, though 

 on somites IV to VII inclusive they become arranged irregularly in 

 two rows. Behind VII the thoracic segments become smooth and more 

 glandular and decrease in length, though even the last is fully one-half 

 longer than the first abdominal. 



Beginning with II, each thoracic segment bears small notopodial and 

 neuropodial tufts of very delicate, narrowly winged capillary setae in 

 the usual positions, but neither the lateral sense organs nor the genital 

 pores can be detected in surface views of these specimens. 



The abdominal segments, of which there are 190, are very short, 

 with shallow, ill-defined furrows, and are either simple rings or ante- 

 riorly obscurely biannulate. The surface is smooth, and the integu- 

 ment provided with a thick glandular coat on the anterior and a much 

 thinner coat on the posterior segments. 



The notopodial tori are very long, but not at all elevated above the 

 surface in these specimens, and bear a great number of uncini. The 

 notopodial torus is much more elevated and prominent, especially on 

 posterior segments, but is much shorter and contains a much smaller 

 number of uncini. The gills are low, rather long, inconspicuous folds. 

 The pygidium forms a narrow circumanal welt bearing two longer 

 prominently protruding ventral cirri and four much smaller ones in 

 two pairs more dorsally placed. 



The uncini (figs. 24, 25) are numerous and very delicate crochets 

 of a peculiar form. They are f-shaped with the densely fibrillated core 

 exhibiting a slight spiral turn, and the tip provided with a single bent 

 terminal process, somewhat flattened and at the base swollen and over- 

 arched by a depressed hood, the margin of which is denticulated with 

 eight or ten teeth. 



The type comes from Station 4,264, off Freshwater Bay, in Chatham 

 Strait, at a depth of 282-293 fathoms, and on a bottom of green mud ; 

 the larger but incomplete cotype was taken at Station 4,197, in the 

 Gulf of Georgia, at a depth of 31 to 90 fathoms, on a bottom of sticky 

 green mud and fine sand. 

 Travisia pupa sp. nov. Plate XI, fig. 23. 



This is a thick, stout, grub-shaped worm tapering nearly" equally 

 both ways but having the anterior end rather blunter and thicker. 

 The considerably number of examples in the collection measure from 

 24 mm. to 82 mm. in length, with corresponding diameters at the middle 

 of from 8 mm. to 32 mm. Exclusive of the pygidium there are thirty. 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 229 



one or thirty-two somites, but the number is not correlated with the 

 size of the worm, the largest two having thirty-one and the smallest 

 thirty-two. 



The prostomium is a minute conical organ, thin-skinned, weak- 

 walled and hollow, and apparently capable of distention by internal 

 fluid. It is followed by a short, uniannular segment continuing the 

 general conical form of the anterior end. Dorsally this segment is 

 crenulated on its posterior margin; below it is flattened and slightly 

 grooved in the middle of the posterior part ; and on each side it is pro- 

 vided with a dorso-lateral groove which terminates anteriorly in a deep 

 sensory pit at the posterior margin of the prostomium. The next 

 segment is biannular, with the anterior ring distinctly larger. Below 

 it forms the upper lip and is thrown into a number of deep longitudinal 

 folds and furrows which pass into the mouth. On each side, above a 

 rather prominent swelling, is a quadrangular area opposite the groove 

 on the first segment and itself bounded by a longitudinal groove above 

 and another below, both of which cut the segment for its entire length. 

 This area bears the small tufts of notopodial and neuropodial setse and 

 between them an elliptical clear spot or pit. Dorsally each ring is 

 marked by longitudinal grooves which effect a peculiar lobed and 

 crenulated arrangement of the posterior margin. The third somite is 

 triannulate, but the anterior two rings are somewhat united and on the 

 ventral surface the first enters the sides of the mouth and the second 

 forms the longitudinally grooved lower lip. At the sides this segment 

 is constructed like the second, except that the posterior third of the 

 quadrate area is depressed and smooth and that a cirrus is borne on 

 each side immediately above and behind the notopodial setae. Above 

 the same longitudinal sulcation and posterior lobing appear. The 

 next twelve segments are formed of three equal rings completely 

 separated by continuous furrows, except for the short interruptions at 

 the setigerous areas on each side. Dorsal longitudinal sulcations are 

 wanting and a second sensory pit, which first appears on the middle 

 of the second ring below the setigerous area of somite IV, becomes 

 very conspicuous on the posterior segments of this region, and on every 

 specimen finally ceases on XV. Somites XVI, XVII and XVIII each 

 consist of a large posterior and a small anterior ring, the furrow separ- 

 ating which becomes successively more and more restricted to the 

 dorsal and ventral regions. Traces of a short anterior ring, differen- 

 tiated only dorsally and ventrally, still continue on XIX and XX, but 

 all remaining somites are strictly uniannulate with prominent over- 

 lapping posterior margins, which finally become telescopic. Somite 




230 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



XIV, which is exactly at the middle of the body, is the longest; but 

 the reduction in l^oth length and diameter of the segments is slight until 

 near the ends, where it becomes more rapid. The pygidium is a short 

 squarely truncated tube marked externally by longitudinal grooves 

 which correspond with the clefts between the nine to twelve uneven 

 lobes into which its margin is divided. 



The surface of the body is vesiculated or finely pustular in the follow- 

 ing manner: Generally over the posterior half of the body, in all of 

 the intersequental furrows and on all except the most anterior setig- 

 erous areas, the pustules are very small and, though numerous, not 

 crowded. In macerated specimens they are collapsed and appear 

 as punctations. From the middle of the body they gradually increase 

 in size forward. Each annulus of anterior somites is provided on its 

 highest part with an irregular transverse series of very large vesicles 

 which usually lie nearer to the posterior margin and overlap the suc- 

 ceeding ring, when the worm is contracted, as a rough and irregular 

 fold interrupted in the median dorsal region. These folds and their 

 vesicles are usually best marked on the middle ring of each somite, on 

 which they increase in prominence from the median break laterally 

 to the setigerous areas, below and even more above which they form 

 rough lobes overlapping the third ring. The ventral lobe bears the 

 ventral sensory pit referred to above. Anteriorly the transverse series 

 of enlarged vesicles tends to form several rows and all of the vesicles to 

 increase in size. The first three segments bounding and anterior to the 

 mouth are covered nearly uniformly with vesicles of moderate size; 

 and similar ones cover the anterior two-thirds of the setigerous areas 

 of the first ten or twelve segments. The prostomium is perfectly 

 smooth and lacks surface vesicles altogether. Posteriorly the ridges 

 of enlarged vesicles and the lateral lappets become gradually flattened 

 out and the entire surface much smoother. The lappets above and 

 below the setigerous areas remain, however, and may become even 

 more prominent on the last few segments, where, however, they are not 

 vesicular. 



Neuropodial cirri appear on III and continue on every segment to 

 near the posterior end, ceasing on from XXIV to XXVII in different 

 specimens. They arise at the dorsal margin of the setigerous area, 

 chiefly from the third annulus but in part from the second also. At the 

 base their diameter nearly equals the length of the third annulus, but 

 they quickly become slender. The surface is strongly wrinkled trans- 

 versely, much like the contracted tentacle of a jelly-fish, and doubtless 

 they are in life capable of great extension;, but in the preserved speci- 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 231 



mens, even where longest (in the middle of the body), they barely 

 equal one-half or one-third of the body diameter. Toward the ends 

 they are reduced to one- third or even one-foiu-th of this length. 



Lateral sense organs appear as a pair between the prostomium and 

 peristomium and occur between the setae tufts of every succeeding 

 segment, except that they are occasionally absent from XXXI or 

 XXXII, In shape they are elleptical with the long axis vertical. 

 Ventral sensory pits appear on IV and continue without exception to 

 XV in the position indicated above. At fu'st very small, they increase 

 rapidly until they exceed the lateral organs, unlike which they are 

 always circular. 



Small notopodial and neuropodial tufts of setae occur on all somites 

 from II caudad at the junction of the second and third rings. Both 

 tufts are retractile into pits and the notopodial setae are somewhat 

 longer than the neuropodial. All setae are very slender, flexible and 

 thread-like, of various lengths in each tuft, and have each margin 

 provided with a fringe of appressed hairs. 



Many of the specimens are enclosed in a very tough mucous mem- 

 brane more or less coated with silt, and often inliabited by small 

 nematodes. 



This species bears much resemblance to Travisia olens Ehlers, which 

 has only thirty segments and rather distinct parapodial papillae. 



It is apparently an abundant worm, conspicuous from its large size, 

 and widespread on muddy bottoms. Specimens were collected from 

 the following stations: 4,192, Gulf of Georgia, 18 to 23 fathoms, green 

 mud and fine sand; 4,194, Gulf of Georgia (tj^e locality), 111 to 170 

 fathoms, soft green mud; 4,197, Gulf of Georgia, 31 to 90 fathoms, 

 sticky green mud and fine sand; 4,230, Behm Canal, 108 to 240 fathoms, 

 rocky; 4,235, Behm Canal, 130 to 193 fathoms, gray mud; 4,237, Behm 

 Canal, 192 fathoms, green mud; 4,246, Kasaan Bay, Prince of Wales 

 Island, 101 to 123 fathoms, gray and green mud, coarse sand and 

 shells. 



Brada pilosa sp. nov. Plate X, figs. 14-17. 



This well-marked species is represented by about a dozen specimens 

 varying in length from 15 to 30 mm., the largest having a maximum 

 diameter of 5 mm. With the prostomium and tentacles retracted, 

 which is the condition of all of the specimens, the form of the body is 

 slender clavate, bluntly rounded at the anterior end and gradually 

 thickening to a])out XI or XII, from which point it tapers into the 

 rather slender, gracefully formed caudal region. 




232 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



The exact form of the prostomium and mouth is not apparent, inas- 

 much as this region is retracted, leaving a conspicuous trifid opening 

 which has been sometimes indicated in descriptions of other species as 

 the true mouth. In this condition the peristomium is trilobate. All of 

 the segments are simple rings, separated from one another by clearly 

 defined but not conspicuous intersegmental furrows which become 

 more distinct posteriorly. The segments pass regularly into one 

 another without any conspicuous breaks in contour, and increase in 

 length, as they do in diameter, to about XII, then undergo little change 

 to the middle of the body, behind which they become again gradually 

 shorter. Toward the posterior end they diminish to a minute pygi- 

 dium which contains a small, vertical, slit-like anus, but appears to 

 lack cirri or other appendages. 



The number of segments varies from 31 to 33, the latter number 

 being present in the type. All, including the peristomium, bear both 

 notopodial and neuropodial setse in tufts upon minute tubercles. 



The chief characteristic of the species is the richness of its papillation. 

 The entire dorsal surface is thickly covered with filiform papillae espe- 

 cially numerous toward the ends, where they are so densely arranged 

 that they actually touch and crowd one another. On the middle 

 segments they are more widely separated, but are still so numerous 

 that where Brada villosa bears 3 or 4 in the length of a somite, this 

 species bears 8 to 12, They are not disposed in regular rows, but are 

 arranged more or less irregularly at nearly equal intervals in all direc- 

 tions. The intersegmental furrows lack papillae and appear as smooth 

 lines, like narrow avenues through a grass field. Just anterior to each 

 parapodium the papillae become few or nearly disappear, leaving a 

 wider open space at this point. Those papillae remaining in this 

 region are collected about the setigerous tubercles, but instead of be- 

 coming enlarged and forming rosettes they are actually smaller than 

 the dorsal ones. 



All of the papillae (fig. 14) are slender, elongated and filiform with 

 a small terminal knob. Many of them collect a thick girdle of sedi- 

 ment in a zone near the base, which gives the appearance of a bulbous 

 enlargement. They differ considerably in length and toward the 

 anterior end of the body exceed the length of the segment bearing 

 them, so that this region has the appearance of being thickly coated 

 with fine hairs. At the level of the ventral margin of the neuropodial 

 tubercles the dorsal papillation ceases abruptly, and is replaced by 

 the much smaller papillae (fig. 15) which cover this surface. Although 

 their number is nearly as great, these papillae are so much smaller than 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 233 



those found on the dorsal surface that to the naked eye they appear 

 merely as a fine granulation. 



Every somite, including the peristomium, bears both notopodial 

 and neuropodial setse in small lateral tufts. The setae of both fascicles 

 have the same character, all being slender and transversely jointed, 

 except at the acutely pointed tip. The former (fig. 16) are very slender 

 and delicate and the internodes increase in length toward the tip. The 

 latter (fig. 17) are more deeply colored, much stouter, distinctly curved 

 and the much shorter joints decrease in length toward the tip. In 

 both tufts the number of setse is small, about eight notopodials and 

 eight or ten neuropodials being the rule. On the peristomium the 

 notopodials are very long, equalling four or five segments, and they 

 project forward far beyond the mouth. On succeeding segments they 

 project outward and upward and decrease in length until they are about 

 equal to the segment bearing them. The neuropodials are rudiment- 

 ary on I, but increase in both length and thickness on succeeding 

 anterior segments, those at the posterior end becoming again more 

 slender but without diminution in length. 



As stated above the prostomium is in all cases retracted. A dissec- 

 tion shows that the tentacles are fine and very numerous, numbering 

 upwards of thirty on each side. They are borne on a pair of bosses 

 which are about twice as wide dorsally as ventrally, where they curve 

 around the mouth and nearly meet. The palpi are very short and 

 broad and marked by a longitudinal groove and transverse wrinkles 

 on the ventral side, the dorsal surface being smooth. The skin is 

 gray, but the papillae impart to the dorsal surface a buffy yellow color. 



Brada pilosa very closely resembles Trophonia hirsuta Theel, but is 

 distinguished by the reduction in size and number of the papillae form- 

 ing the setal rosettes and by the un jointed tip and other peculiarities 

 of the setae. 



The species is not uncommon northward. Examples occur from 

 the following stations : Station 4,251 (type locality), Stephens Passage, 

 198 fathoms, rocky bottom; 4,235, Yes Bay, Behm Canal, 130 to 193 

 fathoms, gray mud; 4,252, Stephens Passage, 198 to 201 fathoms, gray 

 mud; 4,258, Lynn Canal, 300 to 313 fathoms, mud. 



Maldane similis sp. nov. Plate XI, figs. 26-30. 



The type and largest example is 56 mm. long and 2.5 mm. wide, 

 the latter being nearly constant throughout the entire length. 



This species belongs to the M. biceps group in having the cephalic 

 and caudal plates of nearly the same form and size. The cephalic plate 




■234 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



is very broadly elliptical in outline, the margin little limbate, the pos- 

 terior two-fifths separated by a deep notch on each side from the 

 anterior three-fifths, the former erect and with its margin finely den- 

 ticulated with from twenty to twenty-five teeth. One-fourth of the 

 remaining margin anterior to the notch forms on each side a rather 

 thick, narrow, spreading rim, the margin of which is quite entire or 

 merely slightly crenulated, not conspicuously toothed as in M. hiceps. 

 Anteriorly the cephalic rim is separated from the postero-lateral mar- 

 gins of the palpode by a pair of distinct radial furrows. The palpode 

 is very large and contributes easily three-tenths of the entire margin. 

 It is very broad and flat, with a smoothly curved anterior border and 

 rather more than one-third of the middle of its posterior border pro- 

 duced backward on to the head plate as a slightly elevated median 

 welt scarcely rising to the height of a ridge. On each side of this, 

 forming its lateral boundaries and the posterior boundary of the 

 lateral portions of the palpode are the deep sensory slits, U-shaped or 

 hooked, with the lateral limb the shorter. No furrows or other mark- 

 ings occur on the surface of the cephalic plate. 



The mouth is large and the lips prominent and pouting. A short 

 ■distance behind it is a transverse groove encircling the ventral half of 

 the peristomium and joining a conspicuous longitudinal groove which 

 begins at the lateral notch in the cephalic margin and passes along 

 the side of the peristomium, to end posteriorly in the circular furrow 

 which separates a complete narrow ring from the hinder part of the 

 •segment. Inasmuch as the posterior part of the peristomium is re- 

 tracted within the anterior margin of II, this ring is completely con- 

 cealed ventrally by the prominent half-collar developed in that posi- 

 tion on the latter segment. 



The next segment (II) is very short, its length not more than one- 

 half of its diameter; the posterior third is completely separated as 

 &, distinct ring; and the anterior margin is somewhat produced into a 

 collar, the ventral half of which springs into especial prominence 

 abruptly at the level of the setse. Somite III is about one-third longer 

 than II and similarly biannulated, but its anterior margin is not col- 

 lared. Thus far the skin is entirely glandularly thickened. 



The following six segments (IV to IX) are decidedly longer, about 

 equalling their own diameter, and the secondary furrow, while always 

 present, is in a more anterior position not far behind the middle. 

 While the three anterior segments are glandular throughout, the ones 

 under discussion have the glandular area confined to the ventral half 

 of the bod}^ and especially to the anterior ring in the vicinity of the 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 235 



tori. Somites IX and X are indistinguishable, and on the latter the 

 now prominent tori have shifted to the posterior end of the segment. 



From this point the segments continue to lengthen to XIV, which is 

 about three times as long as thick, after which they again decrease. 

 Throughout the middle region the integuments are soft and translucent, 

 except for the swollen, oval, glandular areas surrounding each torus. 

 Somites XVIII, XIX and XX are again much thicker than long 

 and the tori are correspondingly large and prominent; XX is al^out 

 one-fourth as long as thick with a prominent pair of achaetous tori 

 much below the usual level and meeting ventrally. 



The pygidium consists of a very short basal ring bearing a pair of 

 coalesced glandular thickenings corresponding to the tori of XX. 

 The anus is conspicuous and in a dorsal position at the base of the 

 dorsal membrane. The limbate margin of the pygidium bears a re- 

 markable reseml^lance to the cephalic plate, but is oblique in a reverse 

 ■direction. Its ventral two-fifths are separated rom the dorsal three- 

 fifths by a deep rounded notch, with thickened margins which nearly 

 meet externally and constrict its opening. The ventral portion has its 

 margin marked by four very broad, shallow crenulations and a pair 

 of prominent triangular lateral lobes. The dorsal plate is more 

 prominent and flaring, with a smooth and regular margin marked 

 only by a broad and extremely shallow median emargination. 



Somites I and II and the pygidium are achsetous; II bears strictly 

 lateral setaj only, arranged in a vertical tuft just above the dorsal ends 

 of the ventral collar; III and IV bear similar setse tufts and very short 

 series of uncini disposed in the same plane and both strictly lateral 

 and sessile. On succeeding segments the setae tufts have short, slightly 

 oblique bases placed a little in advance of the uncini, which form lines 

 five or six times as long as those on the preceding somites, more ventral 

 in position, and elevated upon distinct tori. Proceeding caudad the 

 uncinial lines increase slightly in length and become more ventral in 

 position. The number of uncini in a torus is about 8 on III, 13 on V, 

 28 on X, 32 on XV and 35 on XIX. 



The small tuft on II contains setse of two kinds, the one small with 

 a rather wide wing and abruptly tapered stem terminating in a slender 

 tip ; the other very much longer, with the stem conspicuously striated 

 the tips rigid and less slender and the wing very narrow (fig. 26). 

 On follomng somites the number of setse increases to 10 or 12 pairs, 

 the larger ones become stouter and the smaller more slender. By 

 somite XV the number is further reduced ; the small setse exhibit only 

 minute pointed tips and the ends of the larger ones are elongated and 




236 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



provided with ensheatliing awns which appear to be disposed in sym- 

 metrical pairs. 



Anterior uncini (on III) (fig. 27) have the head little enlarged and 

 somewhat thrown back, the stout, blunt, nearly straight beak some- 

 what elevated, the crest composed of a single large tooth with a cluster 

 of small ones surrounding its base, and the guard rudimentary or ab- 

 sent (fig. 28). In a succeeding tori there is a gradual transition to the 

 typical form which appears at about VI. Such uncini (fig. 29) have 

 a distinct shoulder, well-defined neck and head, and a stout, tapering, 

 hooked beak with an" acute, slightly recurved tip. The crest is well 

 developed and formed of two transverse rows of numerous teeth which 

 are largest at the vertex and become rapidly reduced laterally. The 

 guard is strong and arising well below the beak sweeps boldly beyond 

 and above its tip (fig. 30). 



The type and one other specimen were taken at Station 4,264, off 

 Freshwater Bay, Chatham Strait, 282 to 293 fathoms, on a bottom of 

 green mud. 



Maldanella robusta sp. nov. Plate XI, figs. 31, 32. 



No complete specimen of this species occurs in the collection, but 

 fortunately there are several heads and one posterior end and it is 

 possible to so fit the fragments together as to secure a complete descrip- 

 tion. 



• The worm thus reconstructed is a fine large one, measuring about 195 

 mm. long and 7.5 mm. in diameter at the middle part. Excluding the 

 pygidium there is twenty-one segments, of which the peristomium 

 and first preanal segment are achsetous, II bears setse only, XX setse 

 only on one side, and III to XIX inclusive both setse and uncini. 



The prostomium and peristomium are completely coalesced and 

 exhibit no trace of a dividing furrow or suture. The cephalic plate 

 meets the dorsal profile of the peristomium at an angle of approxi- 

 mately 135° to 150°, so that the ventral length of the head is nearly or 

 quite twice the dorsal. The cephalic plate has a nearly regular ellip- 

 soidal outline, with a length of about twice the width. Its thin margin 

 is elevated all round, highest and most erect behind, thence slightly 

 diminishing in height to a point anterior to the middle where it is 

 folded and sometimes slightly notched. Anterior to this point it 

 again becomes higher and more flaring until it curves into the base of 

 the palpode, from which it is separated by a slight cleft. Except for a 

 faint crenulation, the margin is entire. The median ridge is rather 

 broad and low, but extends through the anterior half or less only of the 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 237 



cephalic plate, ending abruptly behind; anteriorly it widens slightly 

 and passes partly into the marginal rim, partly into the palpode. On 

 each side of the ridge are deep sensory slits which anteriorly bend 

 somewhat sharply outward and backward, and continue along the base 

 of the lateral fold nearly as far as the posterior end of the median limb. 



From near the posterior end of the median ridge to the lateral fold 

 or notch in the marginal membrane passes a strictly transverse furrow 

 on each side, leaving an extensive area in the posterior region of the 

 head marked onl}^ by a few crescentic furrows parallel with the pos- 

 terior margin. The palpode is a short, broadly rounded, rather thick, 

 tongue-like structure which is continued backward on the ventral side 

 as a broad welt to the mouth, within which it bifurcates to form a pair of 

 ridges separated by a deep cleft. The mouth is relatively small and 

 bounded by a nearly circular fold, elevated and furrowed somewhat 

 like a piece' of rope and which is open only anteriorly to admit the 

 posterior extension of the palpode. 



As before mentioned there is absolutely no visible line of separation 

 between prostomium and peristomium, but the two together constitute 

 a continuous head, shaped somewhat like a horse's hoof; that is, it 

 spreads anteriorly, where it is truncated obliquely by the cephalic 

 plate. The seven somites next following are cylindrical, with a nearly 

 uniform diameter about equalling the posterior diameter of the 

 peristomium, and a length but little greater. All have traces of anterior 

 collars, which are best developed on IV to ^^II, on which also the 

 glandular layer of the skin is thick and extensive. The skin of the 

 head and somites II to I\' is very smooth, iridescent and marked by 

 fine furrows crossing in various directions, like those on the human 

 skin. Somites V to ^TII are of a dull, opaque, non-iridescent white. 

 Following this the body is distinctly depressed and the segments 

 elongated to two or three times their diameter. They bear prominent 

 tori situated along broad elevated longitudinal muscle bands. While 

 the greater part of the surface of the segments is smooth and has a 

 conspicuous bluish iridescence, the longitudinal muscle ridges are 

 vertically furrowed and, when the segments are much contracted, 

 these furrows are extended nearly around the segment. With the 

 exception of -^, the segments bounding which are continuous and 

 the place of transition of the parapodia from an anterior to a 

 posterior position, all of the furrows are well developed. Somite IX 

 is the last exhibiting a distinct glandular region, which is confined to a 

 narrow anterior zone. For nearly the entire length of the worm there 

 appears in the median ventral line a neural cleft in the muscles, having 




238 PROCEEDINGS OF TPIE ACADEMY OF [April, 



the aspect of a clear, translucent, bluish line. There is no diminution 

 in the length of the posterior setigerous segments, but the achsetous 

 segments are considerably reduced in both length and diameter. They 

 are terete, about twice as long as thick, have the surface deeply wrin- 

 kled transversely and bear rather prominent tori in the posterior one- 

 third. Following these is the campanulate pygidium which has a 

 narrow ringed base and a deep cup-shaped body, the margin of which 

 is divided into thirty-nine very regular bluntly rounded teeth, the four 

 ventralmost of which are considerably broader than the others, while 

 at three other points one of the latter has been replaced by two smaller 

 ones. Both without and within the surface of the cup is longitudinally 

 fluted, and in the deeper part of the interior numerous fine ribs, usually 

 two to each marginal tooth, pass to the margin of the very large anus. 



Somite II bears capillary setse only, which arise as a narrow vertical 

 tuft from a slit-like cleft into which they are retractile. Succeeding 

 segments, to XIX inclusive, bear both setse and uncini which are 

 strictly lateral in position, the dorsal interval between the setse scarcely 

 exceeding the ventral interval between the uncini. As far as somite 

 VIII the setae continue to occur in the form of vertical tufts retractile 

 within slit-like pockets; and the uncini, which begin immediately 

 below the setse and lie in the same plane, form strictly linear series 

 sessile or even depressed below the surface. On IX and all subsequent 

 segments the setse are situated on rather prominent wart-like papillse 

 in the form of crescentic tufts open below ; and the uncini are elevated 

 on the crests of swollen tori. On II, III and IV the parapodia are 

 situated in the anterior one-third; on V and VI they are but little 

 anterior to the middle; on VII, VIII and IX they are again near the 

 anterior end ; on X they shift abruptly to the posterior one-third and 

 so remain to the last. The posterior tori are especially prominent. 

 Whether XX is normally setigerous cannot of course be determined 

 until additional specimens are known. 



The number of uncini increases toward the posterior end, the counts 

 being 22 to 26 on III, 35 to 42 on V, 45 to 50 on X, 53 to 57 on XV 

 and 60 on XIX. 



The setse are numerous and form dense tufts. On II those of one 

 series are shorter and about three times as thick as the others and have 

 well-developed wings. Those in the other series are slender and nearly 

 wingless. On succeeding somites all of the setse become much more 

 elongated and more slender, but do not differ otherwise, and appa- 

 rently lack altogether any lateral hairs or awns. 



As indicated above uncini (fig. 31) are numerous on all segments; 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 239 



and are stout, striated, and of a deep yellow color throughout. They 

 differ very little in form on the different segments, the only noticeable 

 distinction being that the extreme anterior ones have the crest teeth 

 less well developed and the guard hairs fewer. The rather long, 

 slender, curved stem has a distinct but tapering shoulder, a rather 

 long, erect neck and an enlarged head, below which is a very prominent 

 square guard process (fig. 32). The beak is stout and hooked, the crest 

 teeth three or four, the lowermost very large, the upper small or obso- 

 lete; sometimes, especially on anterior uncini, a pair of small but dis- 

 tinct lateral teeth is present. The guard is strong and consists of 

 about sixteen stiff hairs which arise from a scale-like base ensheathing 

 the front of the guard process, and spread regularly in an even curve 

 around the end of the beak, above which they arise convergingly to a 

 considerable height. 



The body of the alcoholics is generally colorless or pale yellow, but 

 the cuticle has a strong bluish iridescence throughout. 



A portion of a tube is soft and flexible, consisting of a thick mucoid 

 substance covered with a stratum of moderate thickness of soft grayish 

 brown silt. 



This species is evidently related to the three species of Maldanella 

 described by Mcintosh from the deep waters of the oceans of the 

 Southern hemisphere. The Japanese maldanid Clymene harai Izuka 

 { = Axiothea campanulata Moore) also belongs to this genus. 



The sources of the examples of M. robusta are Station 4,197, Gulf of 

 Georgia, 31 to 90 fathoms, bottom of sticky green mud and fine sand; 

 Station 4,230, Behm Canal, 108 to 240 fathoms, rocky bottom; and 

 Station 4,246, the type locality, Kasaan Bay, Prince of Wales Island, 

 101 to 123 fathoms, bottom of green mud with coarse sand and shell 

 fragments. 



Clymenella tentaculata sp. nov. Plate XI, figs. 33-35. 



This very interesting species is unfortunately imperfectly known, 

 the following description being based upon one anterior and one 

 posterior piece which may be parts of the same individual and which 

 together represent nearly an entire worm. 



The former measiu-es 22 mm. long and 2 mm. wide at IX and con- 

 sists of the prostomium and nine segments ; the latter is much twisted 

 and the five setigerous segments, four achsetous preanal segments and 

 pygidium measure about 20 mm. long. 



The cephalic plate is very much expanded and flares widely at the 

 margin. Its outline is very broadly oval. The hinder third of the rim 

 is separated from the anterior two-thirds by a pair of small lateral 




240 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



incisions, behind which it is more erect and diminishes in height to a 

 minute median posterior notch. Anterior to the lateral incisions the 

 rather abruptly widened and flaring margins continue undiminished 

 almost to the palpode which they join on each side. The cephalic 

 margin is everywhere smooth and its margin entire. A pair of con- 

 spicuous sensory slits divide the central disk of the head for about 

 the anterior five-sixths of its length into three narrow longitudinal 

 areas of equal width which are united behind. The central one is 

 somewhat ridged and widens almost imperceptibly as it passes into 

 the palpode anteriorly. The palpode consists of a short rounded base 

 bearing a slender, elongated finger-like process on its median anterior 

 margin. 



The cephalic plate forms a dorsal angle of about 120° or less with the 

 peristomium, which is indistinguishably coalesced with the prostomium. 

 It is little more than one-half as long as the cephalic plate and its sur- 

 face is slightly granulated but unwrinkled. Owing to the protrusion 

 of the proboscis, which has a depressed acorn-shape, with the basal 

 division thickly papillated, the mouth is invisible. 



Somite II (the first setigerous) has a length about equalling the 

 width at the anterior end, from which it gradually diminishes in dia- 

 meter caudad. The next two segments are narrowerer, after which 

 the diameter increases gradually to VIII, though the length remains 

 nearly constant ; IX has the same diameter, but if complete is scarcely 

 half as long as VIII, All of these segments are transversely wrinkled 

 superficially and are provided with a distinct, raised neural line. No 

 prominent collars but merely a low free rim, most distinct on V, are 

 developed on their anterior ends. 



Owing to the much coiled and twisted condition the real proportions 

 of the distorted posterior segments cannot be easily ascertained. They 

 are evidently three or four times as long as wide, slender and thin- 

 skinned, except posteriorly where the prominent, swollen and glandu- 

 lar parapodia are developed. There are no especially developed 

 glandular zones or muscular ridges and the neural line is elevated 

 throughout. The last six or seven segments decrease in length and the 

 entire region tapers to the pygidium. The first of the posterior achae- 

 tous segments is about one and one-half times as long as wide and of a 

 shape similar to those preceding it, having fully developed but naked 

 tori on the posterior end. The next three are simple rings without 

 tori and of rapidly decreasing length. Terminating the body is a 

 remarkably small, top-shaped pygidium lacking any limbate margin. 

 Instead there arises around the base of the anal papilla, which con- 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 241 



stitutes its greater part, a circle of twenty-three separate and distinct 

 cirri, all of which are slender, regular and equal, and not, as in many 

 species of the genus, alternately longer and shorter. Apparently they 

 increase slightly in size from the dorsal to the ventral side; and the 

 median ventral one is much elongated, its length equalling that of the 

 four achaetous segments combined or about ten times the length of the 

 other marginal papillae, and it is very slender distally. 



On the first three setigerous somites (II to TV) about thirty seta? 

 occur in each group and are disposed in small vertical tufts just above 

 the lateral line and about one-third of the length of the somite from 

 its anterior end. The small number of uncini (3 to 5) are sessile in 

 short, transverse lines just below the seta?. On succeeding segments 

 the setae are more numerous and project upward and outward in tufts 

 from small tubercles. The uncini are more numerous (13 on Y, 20 

 on IX, and still more posteriorly) and form longer lines widely separ- 

 ated below by a space of twice or more their own length. The tori 

 have become prominent swellings. On IX they have become trans- 

 ferred to the posterior end, although the boundary between this seg- 

 ment and VIII is not clearly defined. This condition of the tori con- 

 tinues throughout the body, though they become even more prominent 

 posteriorly and are united across the dorsum of each segment by a 

 glandular band. The dorsal interval between the setae is about equal 

 to the ventral interval between the uncini. The first achaetous seg- 

 ment at the posterior end bears a pair of perfectly normal tori, but no 

 setae or uncini. 



.The setae are often imperfect and their distribution is worked out 

 only incompletely. Anterior segments have them all slightly curved,, 

 delicate and narrowly winged, with very slender, tapering tips. They 

 occur in two series, one of finer, the other of coarser setae. Farther back 

 these two kinds become further differentiated. Both become longer 

 and the slender ones provided with short basal wings, beyond which is 

 a delicate capillary tip doubly fringed with strongly divergent, very- 

 fine hairs. 



All uncini are yellow and have the stems longitudinally striated.. 

 Those of somites II to IV, in which the number is small, have the form 

 shown in fig. 33. The stems are slender, slightly curved, regularly 

 enlarged, but with no distinct nodulus, then slightly constricted to a 

 neck, bearing a scarcely enlarged head (fig. 34), with a simple, tapering 

 unhooked beak, a small crest of three minute teeth and apparently no 

 guards. These uncini increase regularly to the dorsalmost, which 

 16 




242 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



also has by far the most prominent beak. On the remaining somites 

 the uncini differ decidedly in the form of the head (fig. 35) which is 

 much enlarged backward. The smaller beak is more curved and 

 hooked, the crest high and prominent, with five or sometimes six non- 

 fibrous, imbricated teeth of diminishing size. The guard consists of 

 several (about 8) fine tapering hairs, which arise from a plate just 

 beneath the beak, the inferior outline of which they follow to the tip, 

 above which the}^ then rise as curled inarched filaments. 



The alcoholic specimen is colorless, but the greatly developed para- 

 podial plexuses of bloodvessels indicate red bands during life. 



Some fragments of tubes are 3 mm. in diameter. Their flexible 

 walls are composed of a soft mucoid membrane covered with a thin 

 coating of very fine neatly deposited sand. 



This species presents interesting resemblances to Praxilla gracilis 

 (Sars) Malmgren in the form of the head and tentaculiform palpode, 

 to Clymenella catenata (Malmgren) in the number of achsetous preanal 

 somites, and to C. ruhrocincta Johnson in the elongated median ventral 

 pygidial cirrus. 



It is known only from Station 4,264, off Freshwater Bay, Chatham 

 Strait, July 25, 1903, 282 to 293 fathoms, bottom of green mud. 



Uicomache carinata sp. nov. Plate XI, figs 36-39, and Plate XII, figs. 43 and 44. 



A well-preserved but somewhat contracted specimen (the type) is 

 65 mm. long and 3 mm. in diameter at the thickest part. Another in- 

 complete but more fully extended example must have exceeded twice 

 this length when complete. 



The prostomium and peristomium are coalesced, forming a continu- 

 ous head about If times as long as wide. The prostomial region is 

 nearly vertical with about its medial ^ formed by a ridge, which forms 

 a prominent profile, somewhat arched above and ending below and 

 anteriorly in a transverse crescent, separated by a slight groove from 

 the short, somewhat thickened palpode. The latter is continuous 

 with the similarly thickened lateral margins of the head, within which 

 is a pair of shallow longitudinal depressions, while within these again 

 and close to the median ridge are the distinct longitudinal sensory slits 

 or nuchal organs. 



The dorsal peristomial region is somewhat tumid anteriorly, with a 

 nearly straight profile posteriorly, but strongly arched transversely 

 throughout. From the prostomium it is slightly distinguished by a 

 faint transverse groove which passes laterally into the depression men- 

 tioned above and the groove which continues the latter posteriorly to 

 the end of this segment. The mouth is a large elliptical opening sur- 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 243 



rounded by a rugous, furrowed lip. Just behind this lip is a shallow 

 transverse ventral groove, while near its posterior end this segment is 

 completely encircled by another faint furrow which, like the groove 

 mentioned, is met by the longitudinal furrow on each side. 



Besides the pygidium the type has 24 segments, while the only other 

 complete specimen in the collection has 25. The peristomium is 

 achsetous, and somites II to XXII (or XXIII) inclusive are setigerous, 

 leaving two preanal achsetous segments, as in N. lumbricalis. Somite 

 II is as long as the head ; the next seven or eight segments are succes- 

 sively of slightly increased length, the last named being nearly twice as 

 long as the first. Behind IX several segments remain nearly equal in 

 length, then the length diminishes, at first slowly, then rapidly to the 

 last, the last three setigerous segments each equalling III in length and 

 the two achsetous preanal segments together barely exceeding the last 

 setigerous. Somites II, III and IV are of much greater diameter an- 

 teriorly, and slope to the posterior end which is inserted slightly into 

 the next succeeding segment. The next five segments (V to IX) are 

 more nearly cyhndrical, but bear slightly produced glandular collars at 

 their anterior ends. The last four are simple short rings. At the two 

 ends of the body the intersegmental furrows are deep and distinct, but 

 in the middle region they are obscure. 



The pygidium is funnel-form, but little widened, regular and some- 

 what longer than the last two segments combined. On the type its 

 margin is divided into twenty-one equal and regular triangular teeth 

 each with a minute cirriform tip. The only other anal funnel present 

 has but sixteen marginal teeth and cirri. The anus is central and very 

 large, and is surrounded by about ten regular lobes separated by as 

 many radiating furrows. At about somite VIII the neural groove 

 begins to be distinct between the lateral muscle ridges and continues 

 to XXIV, from which point a faint neural line continues across the 

 pygidium to end in the median marginal tooth which is narrower than 

 the others. The other anal funnel has the three median ventral teeth 

 smaller and the nerve cord terminating between two of them. 



No distinctly elevated tori or setigerous tubercles exist anterior to 

 XIII, on which the latter are midway between dorsum and venter, 

 And the ridge-like tori extend from just below them through the centre 

 of the broad glandular zone nearly to the neural line. On succeeding 

 segments they are even more prominent, and behind XV have shifted 

 with the glandular zone to the posterior end of the segment. Toward 

 the posterior end as the thin-walled portion of the segment diminishes 

 ih length they become more central, and finally on XXI and XXII the 




244 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April. 



swollen glandular tori form the entire length of the segment and bear 

 the uncini along the middle. Although XXII and XXIV are achsetous 

 they are similarly constituted. 



The head and first four segments are very smooth, iridescent and of a 

 uniform deep purple color above. The next three segments are smooth 

 and dull yellowish throughout; those of the middle region have pale 

 anterior glandular zones, the rest being yellowish and roughened, while 

 posterior segments are pale throughout and thin-walled, except for 

 the ventral longitudinal bands and posterior glandular zones. 



The peristomium and two preanal segments are achaetous. Somites 

 II, III and IV have a single stout spine situated at about the end of 

 the anterior one-third of the segment and about twice as far from the 

 dorsal as from the ventral median line. A little above and in front of 

 this is a short vertical series of capillary setae. On the remaining 

 segments the setae form more prominent tufts arranged in vertical 

 series midway on the sides of the body and in the middle of the glandu- 

 lar area which lies on the anterior end of the somites as far as about 

 XV, then for some segments on the posterior end, and finally, with 

 the disappearance of the non-glandular region, occupies the entire seg- 

 ment. Uncini occur on all segments from V to XXII inclusive. They 

 are in all cases arranged in a single series in the same plane as the 

 setae, and extend in a line, for a greater or less distance according to 

 their number, on to the ventral surface. On the anterior segments 

 they are slightly larger and fewer, the number counted in the type 

 being 7 to 9 on V, 16 to 19 on X and 10 to 12 on XXII. 



The single ventral spines on II, III and IV are stout, fibrous and 

 yellow, tapering to a slightly curved, blunt, hard point. On the same 

 segments the notopodial tufts contain about six longer, stouter setae 

 (fig. 44) with longitudinally striated stems tapering to stiff, straight, 

 acute tips and provided with a broad and extensive wing on one side 

 and a very narrow one on the other; also a corresponding number, 

 arranged in a parallel row, of much shorter, more delicate setae (fig. 43) 

 with nearly wingless stems tapering to a long hair-like and very delicate, 

 flexible tip provided on each side with minute cilia-like hairs. The latter 

 are so minute that they are visible vmder high powers only. Except 

 for a slight increase in number the stouter setae remain unchanged 

 throughout, but the more delicate ones become considerably modi- 

 fied. By about the tenth 'segment they have become more numerous; 

 some of them (fig. 43) are only moderately elongated (about as much 

 or only slightly more than those of the preceding segments), but the 

 lateral processes have become much larger, ensheathing and awn- 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 245 



like, ancrmay be arranged spirally (fig, 43a) ; others are very greatly 

 elongated, thread-like, openly spiral, tapered very gently to acute tips, 

 and have the lateral processes reduced to minute appressed scales (fig. 

 36). The latter spring in a group from the ventral side of the bundle. 



Typical crochets (figs. 38 and 39) have rather slender, strongly 

 curved stems with an asymmetrical nodulus near the middle, the head 

 very little enlarged and provided with a stout, rather long, moderately 

 acute, strongly hooked, and slightly recurved rostrum, above which 

 is a prominent crest consisting of five, or sometimes of four, depressed, 

 overlapping, diminishing teeth. There are no lateral teeth, but the 

 striations end in several groups of conspicuous markings just below 

 the principal teeth. The guard arises close beneath the rostrum, but 

 separated from the latter by a distinct space. There is no distinct 

 guard process or shoulder, but the guard arises as a distinct transverse 

 plate, soon becoming divided into about twelve slender, tapering fila- 

 ments, which spread around the end of the rostrum or overarch it. 

 The stem, neck and posterior part of the head are strongly striated. 

 Posteriorly the stems of the uncini increase in length. On somite V 

 all of the uncini have the form shown in fig. 37. The stem is straighter, 

 beak less hooked and the teeth of the crest fewer and more erect. 

 The guard is rudimentary. 



The head and succeeding three or four segments are very smooth, 

 iridescent and of a uniform deep purple or reddish-brown color above, 

 not at all spotted or blotched ; the next three segments are smooth and 

 yellowish throughout; those of the middle region have pale anterior 

 glandular zones, the remaining parts being yellowish and roughened; 

 while posterior segments are pale throughout and thin-walled, except 

 in the position of the longitudinal muscles and glandular zones. 



The tubes are stout, thick-walled, hard but fragile structures, com- 

 posed of fine sand grains, sponge spicules and bits of rock cemented 

 together firmly and lined by a thin mucoid layer. Several tubes are 

 sometimes coherent side by side. 



Fragments of this species occur in the collections from the Gulf of 

 Georgia, Station 4,197, 31 to 90 fathoms, on a bottom of sticky green 

 mud and fine sand, and Station 4,198, 157 to 230 fathoms, on a soft green 

 mud bottom. The type locality is Station 4,227, in the vicinity of 

 Naha Bay, Behm Canal, 62 to 65 fathoms, dark green mud and fine 

 sand. 



Nicomache carinata is easily distinguished from A'^. per sonata John- 

 son by the possession of two achaetous preanal segments, while the 

 latter has but one. In this respect it resembles A'', lumbricales Malmg,, 




246 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



but differs from that species in color, the form of the imcini and spines 

 and the greater number of marginal divisions of the pygidium. 



Lumbriclymene pacifica sp. nov. Plate XII, figs. 40-42. 



The type and largest complete specimen, which is unduly elongated 

 through maceration of the middle region, is 103 mm. long and 2 mm. 

 in diameter. 



The head (composed of prostomium and peristomium) is slightly 

 compressed laterally and very short, the length only very slightly 

 exceeding the depth. It totally lacks a cephalic plate and has a 

 nearly straight dorsal profile, meeting the vertical and convex anterior 

 profile at nearly a right angle. There is just the faintest indication of 

 a palpode and of the anterior end of the median ridge. About midway 

 on the side of the head a longitudinal furrow extends from the furrow 

 Yj to a point just over the mouth, and just anterior to the ends of 

 these furrows are the nuchal organs — a pair of small round depres- 

 sions. A few faint short furrows run from near the end of the longi- 

 tudinal furrow toward the mouth, and behind the latter the longitudinal 

 furrow is cut by a transverse furrow which is very strongly developed 

 on the dorsal side but fades out ventrally. From the posterior end 

 of the peristomium a short re-entering half-ring is cut off ventrally by 

 a rather distinct furrow which ends dorsally at the longitudinal furrow. 

 The mouth is a rather conspicuous transverse slit situated about 

 opposite the middle of the head and bounded both anteriorly and 

 posteriorly by rather prominent lips, the former of which is marked 

 by a short but deep longitudinal furrow. 



Somite II is slightly shorter than the head. Behind it the segments 

 increase regularly in length to IX at least, which is about three times 

 as long as the head. Behind this several segments are probably still 

 longer, but owing to their much softened state the exact length is 

 uncertain. At the posterior end XVI is about as long as VI or VII 

 and succeeding segments diminish rapidly, XIX and XX together only 

 about equalling V in length. The two achsetous preanal segments are 

 again much reduced. 



Except that at the extreme posterior end a few are provided with 

 prominent tori, all somites appear to be perfectly cylindrical. Somites 

 II, III and IV bear setae about the middle and just behind them is a 

 faint furrow. The next five bear them near the anterior end just 

 behind the glandular girdle. Posterior somites have their large swollen 

 tori situated near their posterior ends and bearing the small tufts 

 of setse above and moderately long lines of crochets below. The two 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 247 



preanal segments have two tubercles on each side, one above the other, 

 in the position of the tori, but without setse or uncini. 



In the type the pygidium is very short — less than the two preanal 

 segments — and is terminated squarely by a simple slightly convex 

 plate of broadly elliptical outline. Another specimen has the pygidium 

 more extended and nearly twice as long (on the dorsal side) as the two 

 preceding segments, and the terminal plate is oblique at about 45°. 

 In both specimens the plate is margined by a just evident fold, con- 

 tinuous except on the median ventral region. Just anterior to this 

 margin dorsally is the anus. 



The color is well preserved at the anterior end in a sharply con- 

 trasted pattern of reddish brown and white. On the head the former 

 color occurs as follows : over the entire frontal surface, a half-ring on 

 the dorsum of the posterior end of the prostomium, and a broad ring 

 which occupies most of the peristomium and which is much more 

 deeply colored dorsal to the longitudinal furrow than below it. The 

 white areas are a broad band occupying the sides and dorsum of the 

 prostomium above the mouth, ahd a very narrow ring on the anterior 

 end of the peristomium. On several succeeding segments the arrange- 

 ment is in a narrow anterior red ring, then a white ring occupying most 

 of the glandular zone, and succeeding this an extensive red area 

 occupying all of the rest of the segment. These colors are best devel- 

 oped on the dorsum, and gradually fade until by about somite VII 

 only a nearly uniform dull yellow prevails. The glandular areas are, 

 however, always whiter and more opaque than the remainder of the 

 segment. 



The peristomium and two preanal somites are achsetous, II to V 

 bear small tufts of dorsal capillary bristles, and immediately below 

 them two stout straight spines. Remaining somites have dorsal setse 

 tufts, and below them ventral series of crochets occupying from one- 

 eighth to one-sixth of the circumference of the segment. 



The anterior spines (fig. 40) are deep yellow, with opaque fibrous 

 centres and straight blunt ends. In each tuft the setse number from 

 fourteen to twenty in two ranks. On the proximal part of the exposed 

 portion is a rather wide wing, obliquely striated and often frayed and 

 fringed on the free margin. Just below this the shaft is usually con- 

 stricted, and beyond it tapers to a capillary tip which is short on the 

 anterior and very long and dehcate on the posterior segments, but 

 always, so far as determined, quite devoid of hairs or awns. 



Crochets are always few in number, never more than nine to fourteen 

 occurring in each torus. They (fig. 41) are similar on all segments and 




248 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



have well-differentiated shoulder, neck and head. The latter (fig. 

 42) bears a stout, strongly hooked beak, above which are four stout 

 profile teeth of diminishing size, flanked by a few small lateral teeth. 

 The guard arises well below the beak and consists of about twelve 

 coarse fibres which spread in front of and above the apex of the latter. 

 The internal fibrous structure is strongly developed. 



Several tubes of this species occur in the collection and are interest- 

 ing in structure. They measure 70 to 80 mm. long and 2.5 mm. in 

 diameter, and occur either singly or attached in groups or to foreign 

 bodies. Their walls are thin but hard and very brittle and are com- 

 posed chiefly of small sand grains and sponge spicules, the latter of 

 which are so attached that their pointed ends project freely toward 

 the mouth of the tube. Various kinds of foraminifera and other 

 foreign bodies are attached to the tubes, which are always dark- 

 colored at the distal end and clean and pale elsewhere. 



Two complete worms and a fragment together with four or five tubes 

 were taken at Station 4,264, off Freshwater Bay, Chatham Strait, 282 

 to 293 fathoms, bottom of green mud. 

 Sabellaria cementarium sp. nov. Plate XII, figs. 45-51. 



The fine species which represents the genus Sahellaria along the 

 Pacific coast from Washington to Alaska is represented by a number of 

 specimens, but unfortunately only one of these is complete, the others 

 having lost the posterior end either through an attempt to remove the 

 living worm from their tubes or by maceration in the tubes. 



The type and only perfect specimen is 81 mm. long, of which the 

 very slender fecal tube contributes 28 mm. The operculum has a 

 diameter of 4.5 mm., the thorax a width of 6 mm., from which thick- 

 ness the abdomen tapers regularly to about 2 mm. at the posterior 

 end and then suddenly contracts to the 1 to 1.5 mm. of the fecal tube. 

 Counting the peristomium there are five thoracic segments exhibit- 

 ing three distinct types of setation, then follow forty ordinary ab- 

 dominal segments and about forty-six segments in the reduced fecal 

 tube; finally the pygidium is a tubular structure 1.5 mm. long and .6 

 mm. in diameter with its posterior end serrate with about twenty 

 minute teeth. 



The prostomium is minute and completely concealed beneath the 

 enormously developed peristomium. The small slit-like mouth is 

 enclosed between a pair of closely appressed longitudinal folds, 

 bovmded laterally and somewhat enfolded ventrally by the enlarged 

 palps, which are completely connate with the peristomium. 



The peristomium is greatly enlarged and in the type measures 6.5 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 249 



mm. long and 4.5 mm. wide. Dorsally it is completely closed, over- 

 arching and concealing the prostomium and mouth. Together with 

 the palpi which it bears below it forms a broad flat plate, of which the 

 palps form the margins and are rolled inward and nearly touch ven- 

 trally. At its distal end the peristomium bears the operculum — a 

 circular or somewhat elliptical disk directed slightly dorsad and com- 

 posed of three whorls of stout, stiff, hard spines or peristomial setse, 

 so fitted together that they form a flexible and at the same time close- 

 fitting and impenetrable plug to the tube. There are some indications 

 in one specimen that this region may be regenerated when lost. The 

 paleoli of the three rows differ in form and number as indicated below. 

 Just external to and below the operculum is a circle of rather promi- 

 nent conical opercular papillse, which probably represent the much sub- 

 divided dorsal cirri of the peristomium. They are clearly divided in 

 two symmetrical halves like the opercular paleoli, and number 16 to 20 

 on each side. 



The palps may be opened from the ventral side and spread, together 

 with the peristomium, as a flattened plate deeply pigmented below 

 and bearing the branchial folds on the lateral thirds. Anteriorly the 

 two palps are conjoined in the operculum, the branchise also meeting 

 in the middle line below and behind the operculum. From 12 to 18 

 of these l^ranchial folds or ridges occur on each side, the usual number 

 in full-grown specimens being 18 pairs. They are prominent ridges 

 running transversely across the free ventral margin of the palps and 

 diminishing in size from behind forward. Owing to the medial bend- 

 ing of the anterior end of the palps, the anterior six pairs of branchiae 

 are arranged in the form of an arch and several of them lie in a nearly 

 antero-posterior plane. Each gill consists of a stiff plate or ridge, 

 with a serrate free margin behind which the filaments are borne. 

 Except the very last, which usually bears but 10 filaments, the pos- 

 terior gill ridges have about 20, the number decreasing regularly to the 

 most anterior. All gill filaments are very slender and thread-like 

 and the longest posterior ones equal the width of the peristomium. 



At the base of the branchial region is a pair of short rounded lobes 

 having much the aspect of the branchial plates, but shorter and thicker 

 than they and coming in contact across the mouth slit. Continuing 

 from this dorsally is a sloping ridge bearing a pointed conical cirrus 

 longer than the rounded lobe, and above this again a small tubercle 

 carrying a fan-shaped tuft of slender setse. 



Somite II is a short, simple ring partly fused with I and III ventrally 

 to form the first ventral gland plate. Laterally it bears three conical 




250 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



cirri, the ventral about as long as the segment, the middle about two- 

 thirds as long, and the dorsal more than twice as long, slender distally 

 and resembling the branchiae, with which it stands as the first of a 

 series. 



The remaining three thoracic segments are a little longer and IV 

 and V bear distinct ventral glandular plates. Their neuropodial setse 

 are stouter than those on I and II, but have no associated cirri and 

 arise from the anterior margin of the segment on a level about mid- 

 way between the neuropodial tufts of I and II. ' Each of these seg- 

 ments bears a dorsal cirrus or gill similar to that on II and in line with 

 it, leaving a broad, naked area on the dorsum. Unlike II these somites 

 bear no middle cirrus, but in place of it a prominent vertically elongated 

 notopodial tubercle bearing a vertical series of large, coarse, paddle- 

 shaped setse. 



Abdominal segments are somewhat flattened and only obscurely 

 separated. As indicated above they decrease gradually in both 

 length and diameter to the caudal appendage. Dorsally they present a 

 somewhat arched area between the rows of gills and ventrally are 

 excavated by a deep groove for the fecal tube, which is held in place 

 by the tufts of slender neuropodial setae crossing from side to side 

 beneath it. 



The body walls are exceedingly thin and delicate in the dorsal 

 median area and permit the intestine to show through distinctly ; the 

 sides and ventral parts are decidedly thicker and more muscular. 

 The abdominal gills have the same general form and position as the 

 thoracic but are more perfect in structure, having larger blood-vessels, 

 thinner walls and more numerous and prominent transverse cihated 

 ridges along their medial aspect. The first five or six are also much 

 longer and have a length equal to the width of the interbranchial area. 

 From this point they decrease in size very gradually and are totally 

 absent from the last five or six segments. 



On the first abdominal segment the parapodia are very extensively 

 developed and the notopodial uncinigerous tori occupy the entire 

 side of the segment from the branchia nearly to the ventral median 

 line. Ventrally they become higher and terminate in a small free 

 lobe, from beneath which arises a delicate ventral cirrus, and below 

 this again the small neuropodial tubercle with its tuft of setse. The 

 tori decrease in length chiefly from the dorsal end, at first very slowly, 

 then rapidly and at the same time become more sharply defined as 

 distinct, thin, outstanding lobes bearing the uncini on their margins. 

 Toward the posterior end they become merely small prominent pro- 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 251 



cesses with somewhat constricted stalks standing midway between 

 the branchiae and the neuropodial setae tuft. After the first abdominal 

 segment the neuropodial cirrus quickly becomes reduced and in four 

 or five segments has become quite rudimentary or totally absent. 



The caudal or fecal tube has already been partly described. It is 

 very delicate and thin-walled and bears no trace whatever of para- 

 podia. Along its ventral side, however, what appear to be nerve 

 ganglia can be distinctly seen and counted through the body wall, 

 and delicate lines running in pairs from their neighborhood dorsad 

 and cephalad have the same metameric arrangement. 



The type specimen is richly colored. The outer whorl of paleoli are 

 a warm golden, the inner a golden brown. The thoracic region is a 

 rich sienna brown, especially deep on the dorsal interbranchial region 

 of the peristomium as well as of succeeding segments, and on the sides 

 of the latter and the first ventral plate. The ventral post-branchial 

 lobe of I and the dorsal branchiae are also well colored, but other cirri 

 are pale. The gill filaments are pale purple, each with a deep brown 

 basal spot. This specimen is a male, and the abdomen is colored pale 

 cream from the contained sperm. Except for delicate lines formed 

 of minute dots of reddish browm, which begin at the ventral setae tufts 

 and then pass dorsad along the anterior margin of the segment and in 

 most cases continue on to the antero-lateral margin of the gill, there is 

 no pigment in this region. The intestine is filled with a greenish-gray 

 matter that colors the fecal tube. Most of the other specimens are 

 paler, but one has the anterior brown parts of a deep chocolate. The 

 genital products escape by means of a pair of openings through the 

 body walls behind the parapodia of each segment and in several cases 

 from large masses within the tubes. 



The opercular paleoli vary from bright yellow to the more usual 

 deep golden brown. They are all very stout, hard and rigid, and of 

 peculiar irregular forms difficult of accurate description. All have 

 slender, elongated stems, smooth superficially but striated longi- 

 tudinally at the core, bearing very hea^•y and strong external blades, 

 the great part of whose surface is roughened by numerous fine wavy 

 parallel ridges w^hich are slightly imbricated with their edges directed 

 outward. The markings are not shown in the figures. 



The outer whorl of normal opercula contains from 39 to 64, according 

 to the size of the worm, between 50 and 60 being the most usual num- 

 ber. They are arranged in two symmetrical groups, though there 

 appears to be a decided tendency for the right half to include one or 

 two more than the left. Exclusive of the stem they (fig. 45o) consist 




'252 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



of a massive irregularly twisted base, from which arises a tongue-like 

 piece the end of which is strongly flattened at right angles to the great- 

 •est thickness of the base and terminates in a fringed tip, from the 

 central cleft of which arises a slender, densely hairy process (fig. 46). 

 These paleoli are so arranged that they present a spreading rim, in 

 which their twisted form causes the basal portions to be somewhat 

 imbricated from below dorsalwards. 



The middle paleoli number from 14 to 25, usually about 20, in sym- 

 metrical halves. They (fig. 45m) also have a thickened base, from 

 which arises a very prominent upright spine, gracefully curved and 

 tapered to an acute tip. The inner circle of paleoli contains from 14 to 

 22, but in nearly all cases they equal and alternate with those of the 

 middle row. They (fig. 45i) have abruptly widened cleaver-shaped ends 

 bearing a knife-like edge and strengthened on the opposite side by a 

 thickened rim which ends in a short triangular beak. They are dis- 

 posed somewhat obliquely to the middle line and converge ventrally. 



Somite II bears a small tuft of strongly doubly-fringed, feather-like 

 neuropodial setae (figs. 49 and 50). On III the neuropodial setse are 

 partly of a short, more brush-like form and partly very small and of a 

 slender, slightly fringed form. On the remaining thoracic segments 

 they all become more sparsely fringed. The notopodials (fig. 47) on 

 III, IV and V form a single vertical series of stout setse, shaped like 

 an Indian paddle with the end much split and frayed. At the base of 

 each of these is a minute spatulate hairy setse, with the end entire and 

 somewhat produced in the middle, and the blade bent flatways. 



Abdominal setse are all very long and slender, but owing to different 

 states of development appear of unequal length. Their shafts (fig. 

 48) are provided with numerous whorls of hairs united at the base 

 into collars and much produced on one side. 



The uncini (fig. 51) are very numerous and vary from 100 to 200 or 

 even more on a torus. They are nearly colorless, delicate and incon- 

 spicuous, and consist of narrow elongated bodies provided with from 

 7 to 9 (seldom the former) very acute, appressed, overlapping teeth 

 which are arranged in one series and diminish in size toward both ends. 

 Each bears a stiff and rather brittle tendon at each end, the upper one 

 being short and expanded distally into a small plate, while the lower 

 bifurcates immediately into a shorter, irregularly thickened, more ven- 

 tral branch and a slender uniform branch greatly elongated to many 

 times the length of the uncini. 



This species is probably rather common and occurs in the collections 

 from the following stations: 4,220 (type). Admiralty Inlet, near Port 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 253 



Townsend, Washington, 16-31 fathoms, green mud, sand and broken 

 shells; 4,247, Prince of Wales Island, 89-114 fathoms, green mud with 

 sand and broken shells; 4,274 (cotypes), Kadiak Island, 35-41 fathoms, 

 green mud and fine sand. 

 Samytha bioculata sp. nov. Plate XII, figs. 52, 53. 



The anterior prostomial lobe is quadrate, broader than long, its 

 anterior border wider than the posterior, slightly concave and its 

 lateral angles somewhat produced. Immediately behind and separ- 

 ated from it by a distinct transverse furrow is a second small quadrate 

 lobe, with a rather prominent eye or close aggregation of several 

 pigment specks at each antero-lateral angle. Behind this lobe the 

 peristomium forms a broad, smooth, slightly convex area reaching to 

 the branchiae. Ventrally there is a very broad truncate under lip 

 with a glandular margin. In the two known specimens only four to 

 SIX very short clavate tentacles exist on each side. 



The considerably enlarged peristomium projects ventrally as a 

 broad lobe enveloping the lower lip an^l is marked by a narrow trans- 

 verse line of gland cells. Elsewhere it is a simple smooth convex ring. 

 The second somite is about two-thirds as long and marked by a broader 

 glandular half-ring. The third (first setigerous) somite is very short, 

 but succeeding ones increase in length rapidly and by about VIII equal 

 the peristomium. All of the thoracic segments, of which there are 

 nineteen, the last seventeen of which are setigerous, are somewhat 

 muscularly thickened on the ventral half and provided with a narrow 

 presetal half-girdle of glands. The entire dorsum between the setse 

 tufts is thin-walled and smooth throughout. 



Fourteen segments in the type and larger specimen, and thirteen in 

 the smaller cotype, form the abdomen. In the former this region 

 comprises about one-third of the entire length ; in the cotype not more 

 than one-fourth. Owing to the projection of the parapodia from the 

 angles this region is decidedly quadrate, but somewhat arched dorsally 

 and marked ventrally by a narrow neural groove. The somites dimin- 

 ish regularly in all dimensions from before backward and the entire 

 region tapers to the pygidium, which forms a ring surrounding the large 

 anus and bears a pair of slender, prominently projecting cirri about 

 equal to half the diameter of the body at the posterior end. 



The four pairs of branchiae are so much crowded antero-posteriorly 

 that they appear to form a single series extending quite across the 

 dorsal area of II and III., Closer study shows that two are anterior 

 and slightly more lateral and two posterior and more median. They 

 are all similar, slightly flattened, slender and elongated, their length. 




254 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



being about three times the diameter of the region of the body from 

 which they spring. 



Setae begin on III as a pair of minute tufts arising from an elevated 

 position just beneath the gills. The tufts on IV are also small and 

 placed nearly as high. On succeeding somites the setae become larger 

 and more numerous and the tufts gradually assume a low station on 

 the sides of the body as the abdomen is approached. They continue 

 to XIX. 



Uncinial tori begin on VI, or the fourth setigerous somite. Through- 

 out the thoracic region they are low, but freely projecting, compressed 

 folds which arise immediately ventral and slightly posterior to the 

 setae tufts and end ventrally in a freely hanging lobe or process. On 

 abdominal segments the notopodia are distinctly separated from the 

 neuropodia and project as small papillae from the dorsal angles of the 

 body. The neuropodia are small, compressed lappets constricted at 

 the base and bearing the' uncini along the free margin; apparently they 

 lack cirri. 



Setae are all of one kind, slender, tapered and narrowly winged on 

 both sides of the free portion nearly to the very acute tip. The uncini 

 form a close single rank in which they are quite numerous (108 on X). 

 From dorsal to ventral end of each series they decrease in length. 

 They (fig. 52) are roughly triangular with a nearly square but sometimes 

 projecting upper ligament process, above which the tooth-bearing 

 margin rises but slightly. The inferior process varies in form, but is 

 usually more or less incurved. Those of the type specimen almost 

 constantly bear four long, slender, acute, overlapping teeth, the ven- 

 tralmost of which is the stoutest, the two middle the longest and the 

 upper the most slender. On the cotype a fifth smaller and sometimes 

 minute tooth exists at the upper end of nearly all uncini (fig. 52a). 

 Abdominal uncini (fig. 53) have the same form, but are much fewer in 

 number. 



This species is founded on two much macerated specimens, of which 

 the larger and type is 30 mm. long and filled with large ova. The 

 smaller example is 16 mm. long. 



A nearly complete tube is 65 mm. long. Its basal third is soft, 

 thin-walled and membranous. Beyond this the walls gradually 

 thicken by the accumulation of silty material until they attain a 

 diameter of about 5 mm. This entire region of the tube is supported 

 and protected by siliceous sponge spicules, the ends of which project 

 in all directions and produce a very firm and bristling structure.

Both specimens come from Station 4,197, Gulf of Georgia, 31 to 90 

 fathoms, sticky green mud and fine sand. 



Amphicteis scaphobranchiata sp. nov. Plate XII, figs. 54-61. 



A single well-preserved specimen represents this noteworthy species. 

 The length without branchiae is 32 mm., the branchiae 7 mm., and the 

 maximum '\\ddth in the anterior part of the thorax 2.8 mm. 



The anterior lobe of the prostomium (fig. 54) is almost completely 

 divided by a longitudinal fiu-row into a pair of somewhat slender 

 tentacle-like divisions which are somewhat divergent anteriorly. A 

 narrow transverse welt passes across the base of this region and is 

 partly concealed by the much larger and more prominent sensory 

 folds which lie behind it. These pass from the lateral borders of the 

 head nearly transversely to the middle line, where they meet in a wide 

 angle. Laterally they are continuous with the lateral lobes or folds 

 which join the frontal lobe beneath. The tentacular membrane lies 

 below the frontal and lateral lobes and is partly embraced by the 

 peristomium. It bears from twelve to fifteen tentacles on each side, 

 the lateral ones being very short and the middle ones as much as two- 

 thirds the width of the thorax. All and especially the shorter ones 

 are more or less clavate. 



The prostomium passes without any clear demarkation into the 

 peristomium, which reaches as a smooth unbroken convex surface to 

 the branchial segment. Dorsally it is remarkable for its extent, 

 smoothness and absence of furrows. Its length and breadth are each 

 equal to about two-thirds of the width of the branchial segment. In 

 the middle line it reaches to the interbranchial shield, but its postero- 

 lateral angles are cut off by the paleolar tubercles and lateral portions 

 of somite II. Ventrally the peristomium forms a large, broadly trun- 

 cated lower lip, slightly inserted into II and embraced laterally by the 

 paleolar tubercles. 



The second somite is more than half as long ventrally as the peristo- 

 mium, but except for the narrow strip extending dorsally beneath the 

 branchiae it ends abruptly at the enlarged paleolar tubercles. Somite 

 III is very short and IV slightly longer, the two combined just equalling 

 the length of II. Behind this region the segments again diminish in 

 both length and diameter to the pygidium. With the exception of 

 the last three or four, the thoracic segments are ill defined on the ven- 

 tral and not at all on the dorsal side. Up to the level of the setae tufts, 

 where a lateral shelf -like ridge is formed, the body walls are rather 

 thick and firm, with slight anterior glandular bands and obscure 

 ventral plates. Dorsal to the setae the body for the entire length is 




256 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



perfectly smooth and iinsegmented. The last three or four thoracic 

 segments are transitional in character to the abdominal. The latter 

 are more distinctly differentiated, owing in part to their more promi- 

 nent parapodia and in part to the greater depth of the ventral furrows. 

 The last few segments are separated by obvious furrows even on the 

 dorsal side. Owing to its being crushed the pygidium cannot be 

 described further than to refer to the pair of prominent, slender and 

 stiff cirri which it bears. A distinct neural groove extends through- 

 out the abdominal region and even on to several of the posterior thora- 

 cic segments. A remarkable smoothness and peculiar dull iridescence 

 characterizes the entire cuticle of this worm. 



If normally formed in this specimen the branchise are highly char- 

 acteristic. All four pairs are large and stout and arise in the usual 

 manner, two pairs anterior and more lateral from II and III and two 

 more posterior and median from IV, those of each side being com- 

 pletely coalesced at the base. A small shield-shaped area separates 

 them in the middle line, but otherwise they cover the entire width of 

 the dorsum. Viewed from above they cover and conceal the entire 

 head and curve downward in front of the prostomium and beneath the 

 tentacles. All are very broad and flat at the base, especially the two 

 inner ones on each side. In the case of three of them the outer one- 

 third is less flattened and tapers to a blunt point. The anterior median 

 of both sides, however, expands into a broad flat plate (fig. 56) some- 

 what lobed on the margins and terminated by a tapering process bent 

 sharply on itself into a hook. This process is complete on one side 

 only, having been broken off of the other. Probably all of the branchise 

 are straight in life, but they are peculiarly stiff and rigid and their 

 cuticular covering is thick and marked by fine transverse strige, but 

 otherwise smooth. 



Thoracic parapodia consist of simple setigerous tubercles arising 

 from the lateral muscular shelf and short auriculate tori with both 

 dorsal and ventral angles produced somewhat freely. Abdominal 

 parapodia (fig. 57) consist of prominently projecting hatchet-shaped 

 ventral tori, each bearing a minute cirriform process, and sharply 

 bent, clavate dorsal cirri which replace the setigerous tubercles of the 

 thoracic region. Parapodia of successive somites are united by a 

 beaded muscular ridge which passes along the side of the abdomen 

 between the torus and cirrus. The worm consists of thirty-two seg- 

 ments, of which II bears the paleoh. III to XIX ordinary setse, and VI 

 to XXXII uncini. 



The paleoli (fig. 58) are of a clear, bright glistening straw color and 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 257 



are arranged in a half tubular figure at the base, from which they 

 diverge and spread distally in a fan-shaped fascicle. In each tuft the 

 shortest one (at the inner end of the posterior limb) is about twice as 

 stout as the longest. Distally they all taper regularly and rather 

 rapidly to very long, slender, acute and stiff tips. Except for these 

 tips they are striated conspicuously in both the longitudinal and 

 transverse direction. 



The ordinary set* (fig. 59) are few in number and form rather small 

 close tufts. They are apparently similar on all segments, being rather 

 slender with tapering stems and acute, tapering tips, striated some- 

 what obliquely, and provided on one side with a mng of moderate 

 width marked with distinct oblique striae. 



The uncini are numerous on the thoracic segments (135 on X). 

 They have the form shown in figs. 60 and 60a, being roughly tri- 

 angular, with large bases, a prominent superior ligament process, a 

 projecting rounded lower angle and long tooth-bearing border with 

 five or six strong acute teeth, the lowermost of which is peculiarly 

 bevelled and covers a short inferior ligament process which nearly 

 touches its lower surface. Abdominal uncini (fig. 61) are fewer in 

 number (78 on XXV), much smaller, and formed quite differently. 

 They have small bases and high outstanding tooth-bearing rami, and 

 apparently lack the inferior ligament process. 



Several thick-walled mud tubes in the same bottle were probably 

 fashioned by this species. 



Type locality. Queen Charlotte Sound, off Fort Rupert, Vancouver 

 Island, B. C, Station 4,201, 138 to 145 fathoms, soft green mud, sand 

 and broken shells. 



Chone gracilis sp. nov. Plate XII. figs. 62-66. 



A very pretty small species resembling Chone duneri Malmgren in 

 proportions but differing from that species in the short, and broadly 

 winged, barbless tips of the branchiae. From C. teres Bush this 

 species is easily distinguished by its much longer branchiae, small 

 number of abdominal segments and the more elongated form of the 

 abdominal uncini. 



The type specimen has a total length of 32 mm., of which the 

 branchiae make 12 mm. and the thorax 5 mm., the diameter for nearly 

 the entire length being about 2 mm. 



The branchial bases are simple and very low, being completely con- 

 cealed by the high collar. Ten pairs of delicate branchiae extend 

 equally to a length of more than one-half of the body. The stems are 

 united by a very delicate membrane for three-fifths of their length and 

 17 




258 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



the remainder is broadly winged on both sides. The barbs are very 

 delicate and are absent from an acute foliaceous tip about 2 mm. long. 

 Eyes are totally wanting. 



A collar of the form typical of the genus rises to a height of two and 

 one-half times the length of the segment which follows it. The dorsal 

 ends are refolded into the dorsal sinus and a slight notch occurs in a 

 median ventral position ; otherwise it is quite simple. The very small 

 tentacles are shorter than the diameter of the body. 



Nine segments, 8 of which are setigerous, form the thorax and 51 

 segments the abdomen. For nearly its entire length the body is 

 cylindrical and of almost uniform diameter, but in the posterior fourth 

 becomes somewhat broader and depressed before tapering rapidly to 

 the caudal end. No distinct glandular ventral plates are developed, 

 but all of the thoracic and the anterior three or four abdominal 

 segments are completely encircled by a thick glandular layer. The 

 thoracic and a few anterior abdominal segments are strongly biannulate, 

 the middle abdominal are simple and half as long as wide, while the 

 posterior are much shorter and more crowded. The fecal groove is 

 distinct on the caudal fourth of the abdomen, and conspicuous on a 

 few anterior abdominal segments, also where it passes obliquely around 

 the right side of the first abdominal segment and on the dorsum of 

 the thorax ; elsewhere it is faint or absent. A few small ova are present 

 in the coelom. Every portion of this worm is white, without a trace 

 of pigment anywhere. 



All setse tufts are short but rather prominent ; uncinigerous tori are 

 also short and nearly uniform, diminishing only slowly and regularly 

 from the first to the last. The setse and uncini are all delicate and 

 colorless. The collar fascicle consists of a small number of narrowly 

 winged, acute, capillary setse. Remaining thoracic somites have a 

 larger number of partly capillary, partly spatulate setse placed be- 

 tween two small lappet-like processes. The former consist of a dorsal 

 row of acute tapering setae with one moderately wide and one just 

 perceptible wing and a small number of very small and inconspicuous 

 crooked setse (fig. 62) with rudimentary wings found below the spatu- 

 lated setse. The spatulate setse (fig. 64) are arranged in two rows of 

 about ten each; they have delicate, striated, usually symmetrical, 

 obovate blades, and long very slender mucronate processes. The 

 abdominal setse (fig. 63) are also in one series, few in number, rather 

 coarser than the thoracic and with the two wings narrow and about 

 equally developed. Thoracic uncini contain a single series of erect 

 crochets or hooked setae (fig. 65) with striated stems and the slightly 

 enlarged head thrown back, a large coarsely divided crest and stout>

blunt beak. On somite V there are 13 in a torus, on somite VIII 

 11. The abdominal tori contain uncini of the form shown in fig. 66, 

 with quadrate bases and heads of much the form of the thoracic crochets 

 but strongly recurved on the base. They are more numerous than the 

 thoracic crochets, somite XXI containing 17. 



The tube is nearly transparent, little tortuous and almost free from 

 sand. 



The single specimen comes from Station 4,274, Alitak Bay, Kadiak 

 Island, 35 to 41 fathoms, on a bottom of gree» mud and fine sand. 

 A smaller specimen was taken at Station 4,253, Stephens Passage, 131 

 to 188 fathoms, rocks and broken shells.

RECORDS AND DESCRIPTIONS OF NON-SALTATORIAL ORTHOPTERA FROM 

 BRITISH GUIANA. 



BY JAMES A. G. REHN. 



The records given in the following pages are all from a collection of 

 Orthoptera made in 1901 at Demerara, British Guiana, by R, J. Crew, 

 and for the privilege of studying which the author is indebted to Prof. 

 Lawrence Bruner. The series contained sixty-one specimens, repre- 

 senting thirty-four species, of which six are new. The types are in 

 Prof. Bruner's collection. 



BLATTID^. 

 ANAPLECTA Burmeister. 

 Anaplecta pulchella n. sp. 



Type: 9 ; Demerara, British Guiana, 1901. (R. J. Crew.) 

 Closely allied to A. mexicana Saussure and dohrniana Saussure and 

 Zehntner, but differing from mexicana in the narrowly incised supra- 

 anal plate, the more angulate proximal portion of the appendicular 

 field of the wings, and in some details of the coloration. From dohr- 

 niana it differs in the wings, in the coloration and somewhat in the 

 shape, but agrees in the shape of the supra-anal plate. 



Size rather large (for the genus); form rather flattened and sub- 

 elliptical; surface glabrous. Head about completely hidden under the 

 pronotum; interspace between the eyes almost twice the depth of one 

 of the eyes; antennse sparsely haired. Pronotum transversely ovate, 

 the cephalic margin regularly arcuate, caudal margin very slightly 

 arcuate, lateral margins rounded obtuse-angulate ; disk somewhat 

 deflected laterad. Tegmina exceeding the apex of the abdomen, sub- 

 lanceolate with the costal margin slightly arcuate except proximad 

 where it is rather strongly arcuate, sutural margin straight, apex acute; 

 basal field small, sub-coriaceous; anal field elongate sub-pyriform in 

 shape and containing four veins; costal veins thirteen in number, the 

 interspaces between the distal ones supplied with short spurious veins 

 which do not coalesce with the discoidal vein; median vein with four 

 rami of which the second (enumerating proximo-distad) is bifurcate. 

 Wings with the appendicular field of medium size, sub-rectangulate 

 with the margins rounded and the proximal angle decidedly obtuse : 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 263 



clavate costal veins seven in number, the clavation being very large 

 and short, in fact decided inflations, non-clavate costals five in number, 

 distad of the clavate ones; medio-discoidal area with quadrate inter- 

 spaces; axillary vein with one principal branch diverging caudad, 

 which latter has two rami. Supra-anal plate transverse, rounded 

 with a slightly median emargination; subgenital plate not reaching to 

 the apex of the supra-anal plate, inflated and with the caudal section- 

 compressed and narrowly divided, reminding one of the structure of 

 the valves of the Blattinae. Femora with their ventral margins spined. 

 General color tawny above; head ochraceous with a pattern of four 

 transverse and one short longitudinal occipital bars of seal brown, eyes 

 seal brown, antennae ochre yellow proximad and dull brownish distad. 

 Pronotum with the disk seal brown and the lateral portions hyaline, 

 the disk broad caudad narrowing cephalad. Tegmina of the general 

 color with a spot in the anal field, a more prominent one at the base of 

 the discoidal field and another rounded one near the middle of the 

 discoidal field raw umber. Wings very slightly washed with olive, 

 except the sections adjacent to the proximal portion of the costal 

 margin and the caudal section of the inserted angle of the appendicular 

 field, which are washed with ochre yellow. Ventral surface and limbs 

 pale clay color, margined, lined and touched with mummy brown.

Length of body, 7.6 mm. 



Length of pronotum, 2.2 " 



Greatest width of pronotum, 3 " 



Length of tegmen, 8 '' 



Greatest width of tegmen, 2.5 '' 



The type is the only specimen seen. 

 Anaplecta fulgida Saussure. 



Two males, two females. 



Two of the above specimens belong to the form of the species with 

 the disk of the pronotum dark, both sexes being represented. The 

 tegmina in these dark specimens are somewhat darker than in the 

 other individuals. 



This species has been recorded from Tabasco, Mexico, Guatemala 

 and Piedras Negras, Costa Rica, this constituting the first South 

 American record. 



PSEUDOMOPS Serville. 

 Pseudomops crinicornis (Burmeister). 



One male, one female. 



While these specimens would, by their uniform black antennae, fall 




264 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



under luctuosa (Saussure), the original description of crinicornis con- 

 tains nothing at variance with the material examined, no mention 

 being made of the antennae, while the median whitish spots on the 

 tegmina are distinctly specified. It would appear from the description 

 that the form described as crinicornis by Saussure and Zehntner^ is 

 not the crinicornis of Burmeister. Whether lectuosa is distinct from 

 crinicornis is a matter which cannot be settled here, the two having 

 already been synonymized. 



The specimens studied show that the male is more uniformly colored 

 than the female, the pronotum being without a light caudal margin 

 and the median tegminal spots are absent, while the pale border of 

 the coxae and ventral abdominal segments are much narrower than in 

 the female. 



PSEUDOPHYLLODROMIA Bmnner. 

 Pseudophyllodromia pavonacea Rehn. 



1903. Pseudophyllodromia pavonacea Rehn, Trans. Amer. Ent. Soc, XXIX, 

 p. 262. [Bartica, British Guiana.] 



One male. 



This specimen is inseparable from the type with which it has been 

 compared. 



Pseudophyllodromia fasciatella Saussure. 



Three males, one female. 



These specimens agree perfectly with a series of sixteen individuals 

 from Bartica, British Guiana. 



Pseudophyllodromia obscura Saussure. 



1874. Pseudophyllodromia obscura Saussure, Mem. Soc. Phys. et d'Hist. 

 Nat. Gen6ve, XXIII, p. 98. [Brazil.] 



Four females.. 



These specimens agree well with the description except that the 

 disk of the pronotum is red-brown overlaid with blackish instead of 

 maroon brown as described. 

 Pseudophyllodromia prona n. sp. 



Types: cJ^ and 9 ; Demerara, British Guiana. 1901. (R. J. Crew.) 



Allied to P. peruana and lineolata Saussure, and differing from the 

 former in the strongly lined interocular space, the color of the face and 

 the coloration of the tegmina, the pale portions of the latter being 

 small maculations and not whole areas. From lineolata it differs in 

 the maculation of the pronotum, the general color of the head and the 

 smaller tegminal markings. No other species of the genus appears 

 to be any way as closely related as the two mentioned above. 



» Biol. Oent.-Amer., Orth.. I, p. 33. . 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 265 



Size medium; form as in other species of the genus but shghtly 

 broader. Head considerably exserted, the eyes rather prominent, 

 the interspace between them not as wide as the depth of the eye in 

 either sex; antennae fihform, very sparsely haired, in length very con- 

 siderably exceeding the length of the body. Pronotum transverse 

 sub-elliptical, cephalic margin with an extremely slight median angu- 

 lation; caudal margin distinctly but not greatly angulate, the margin 

 laterad of the angulation slightly emarginate; lateral margins arcuate 

 producing slightly lateral cephalic and caudal angles; surface of the 

 disk with two impressed areas, one or each side, extending caudo- 

 laterad from about the caudal fourth of the pronotum ; lateral portion 

 of the pronotum considerably depressed. Tegmina with the venation 

 prominent ; costal margin arcuate on the proximal half, about straight 

 with a hardly perceptible emargination in the distal half, sutural 

 margin with two arcuations, one of the anal field, the other of the 

 remainder of the tegmen; apex narrowly rounded; basal field narrow, 

 limited to about the proximal third; anal field elongate-obovate, the 

 anal sulcus more impressed in the male than in the female; costal 

 veins thirteen to sixteen in number, rami of the median vein all longi- 

 tudinal. Supra-anal plate of the male shorter than the subgenital 

 plate, cerci over twice the length of the subgenital plate, moniliform, 

 tapering from the middle, subgenital plate rather short, transverse, the 

 apex narrow and shallowly emarginate. Supra-anal plate of the 

 female shorter than the subgenital plate, cerci similar to those of the 

 male, subgenital plate flat, the apical margin with a deep, very narrow 

 median incision. Femora spined. 



General colors clove brown and pale ochre yellow. Head with three 

 median, longitudinal, closely placed, parallel ochre yellow lines on the 

 interocular space, the face with five transverse maculations of the 

 same color, the dorsal one a complete fine line, the second, between 

 the antennae, a broadly V-shaped mark, the third a row of four sub- 

 circular maculations, the fourth, on the clypeal suture, a thick, nar- 

 rowed mesad line, the fifth a simple line across the clypeus ; eyes walnut 

 brown ; antennae strongly inf uscate except a brief ferruginous proximad 

 section. Pronotum with the disk clove brown, a narrow median line 

 and the lateral section pale ochre yellow, a spot on the caudal section 

 of the pale lateral sections clove brown; caudal margin narrowdy pale. 

 Tegmina with the base color deep brownish, the basal field and inter- 

 spaces between the veins of the anal area and between the costal veins 

 and two spots in the proximal section of the discoidal field, one in the 

 very narrow proximal section and the other just distad of it, pale

ISCHNOPTEKA Burmeister. 

 Ischnoptera nyctiboroides n. sp. 



Type: ? ; Demerara, British Guiana. 1901. (R. J. Crew.) 

 Belonging to the group containing /. azteca, tolteca, nana and parvula, 

 but differing from all in the larger size, and apparently from most of 

 them in the comparatively large intercalary area of the wings. 



Size rather large; form robust, general form and coloration super- 

 ficially reminding one of a Nyctibora; surface glabrous, but not with 

 a very high polish. Head not hidden by the pronotum, the occipital 

 margin evenly arcuate, interspace between the eyes slightly wider 

 than the depth of one of the eyes; mandibular palpi with the distal 

 joint elongate-elliptical when viewed dorsad, the ventral surface ex- 

 cavate for the entire length. Pronotum of the shape usually found 

 in Ischnoptera, the cephalic margin sub-truncate, the caudal margin 

 sub-truncate with an extremely slight median angulation, lateral 

 margins slightly arcuate, the greatest width caudad; lateral sections 

 somewhat depressed, the disk without depressions. Tegmina extend- 

 ing beyond the tip of the abdomen by about two-thirds the length of 

 the pronotum; costal margin evenly arcuate; sutural margin straight 

 except in the distal fourth, where it is obliquely diverted toward the 

 apex which is in the general curve of the costal margin and rounded 

 acute-angulate in character; basal field not extensive; anal field 

 elongate-obovate, the apex blunt; veins of the anal area seven in num- 

 ber, the costal veins very numerous, discoidal field with the veins 

 distinctly longitudinal. Wing with the greatest width contained 

 slightly more than one and one-half times in the length; costal veins 

 about eleven in number excluding the branches of the mediastine vein, 

 the majority being distinctly but not at all greatly thickened near the 

 margin; discoidal vein with a caudal ramus diverging near the middle 

 anterior ulnar vein with two complete and about two incomplete rami ; 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 267 



intercalary area rather small but distinct, extending about a sixth the 

 way to the base of the wing, the apical margin of the area ver}^ gently 

 obtuse-angulate. Supra-anal plate transverse, somewhat produced 

 mesad and very narrowly emarginate; cerci about equal to the sub- 

 genital plate in length, tapering in the distal half; subgenital plate 

 somewhat transverse, the distal margin arcuate, not emarginate and 

 not distinctly excavated for the cereal bases. Cephalic femora armed 

 on the ventro-cephalic margin, with about five large spines placed 

 mesad and a number of slightly smaller ones distributed between the 

 larger spines and the distal extremity; median and cephalic femora 

 with the ventral margins armed. 



General color vandyke brown, narrow lateral areas on the pronotum 

 and the basal areas of the tegmina ochre yellow. Head uniform except 

 for the antenna, the regions of their insertion and the clypeiis which 

 are dull ochraceous. Pronotum with the median area very dark, 

 almost seal brown, the lateral light areas being connected by a thread 

 of the same color, which extends around the cephalic margin. Teg- 

 mina almost ochraceous-rufous when viewed by reflected light, the 

 area of the right tegmen covered by the left being vandyke brown. 

 Wings washed with vandyke brown, the anterior field with the suf- 

 fusion very strong, the color being quite solid around the costal veins 

 Abdomen with the segments margined with seal brown, a broad bar 

 of the same color paralleling the lateral margins and suffusing the 

 subgenital of the preceding plate. Limbs ochraceous, the coxae each 

 with two transverse bars of seal brown connected along the lateral 

 sulcus of the coxa by a longitudinal bar of the same color.

BLATTELLA CaudeU. 

 Blattella minor (Brunner). 



1865. Ph[yllodromia] minor Brunner, Nouv. Syst. Blatt., p. 94. [Brazil.] 

 One male. 



This specimen fits Brunner's description of this species, except that 

 the bars on the pronotum are fairly well separated, while Brunner says 

 ' ' linea separanti tenuissima. ' ' 




268 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



Blattella inexpectata n. sp. 



Type: ? ; Demerara, British Guiana. 1901. (R. J. Crew.) 



In general appearance this form resembles B. parana (Walker) from 

 Para, but it is larger with a richer coloration and with the caudal 

 margin of the pronotum more arcuate. In some respects this species 

 resembles the vitrea-dilatata-pavida group but is more slender, bearing 

 a considerable superficial resemblance to Ischnoptera hlattoides. 



Size medium; form moderately depressed, elongate-elliptical; surface 

 glabrous. Head almost entirely covered by the pronotum, narrowest 

 portion of the interspace between the eyes slightly less than the depth 

 of one of the eyes; antennae well separated at the bases, in length ex- 

 tending caudad to the distal extremity of the caudal coxae. Pronotum 

 moderately transverse, ovate, narrow, cephalic margin subtruncate, 

 caudal margin moderately arcuate with an extremely slight median 

 angulation, lateral margins arcuate with the greatest width very slightly 

 caudad of the middle; lateral sections moderately depressed. Tegmina 

 slightly exceeding the apex of the abdomen, the greatest width con- 

 tained slightly more than three times in the length; costal margin 

 arcuate, the arcuation of the proximal third much greater than that of 

 the remainder of the margin; sutural margin nearly straight, very 

 obhquely truncate in the apical fourth where it turns to meet the nar- 

 rowly rounded apex ; basal field narrow and covering slightly more than 

 a third of the length of the tegmen; anal field obovate in shape and 

 about equalling the basal field in length ; costal veins about f om'teen in 

 number, median vein with four rami, the distal of which has four 

 branches, some of which has the branching carried two stages farther; 

 anal area with five veins. Wings with the costal veins numbering 

 about nine, the majority of the veins being distinctly incrassate distad; 

 anterior ulnar vein bearing three complete rami. Supra-anal plate 

 trigonal with a rather large median emargination; cerci about equal 

 to the subgenital plate in length, fusiform; subgenital plate moderately 

 inflated, somewhat tectate, apical margin shallowly emarginate, well 

 marked cereal sinuations present. Cephalic femora armed on the 

 ventro-cephalic margin with four large median and one large distal 

 spine, the intervening area filled with fine comb-like spines. Median 

 and caudal femora with the ventral margins spined. 



General color ochraceous, becoming ochraceous-rufous on the disk 

 of the pronotum and the section of the tegmina which when in repose 

 cover the body. Eyes bistre; lateral sections of the pronotum and 

 costal section of the tegmina translucent ochre yellow, the section 

 of the left tegmen which in repose is covered by the right is very pale,

nearly buff in color. Wings strongly washed with ochraceous; limbs 

 pale ochraceoiLS.

NYCTIBORA Burmeister. 



1838. Nyctihora Burmeister, Handb. d. Entom., II, Abth. II, pt. I, p. 501. 

 Included N. crassicornis, sericea, holosericea and latipennis Burm. 



Kirby has selected sericea as the type. 



Nyctibora tomentosa (Serville)? 



1839. Blatta tomentosa Serville, Orthopteres, p. 86. [Surinam.] 

 Two males. 



These specimens show some few characters at variance with the 

 original description, but agree with the description of a female given 

 by Saussure.2 Walker's tenebrosa from Demerara appears to be a 

 rather different insect. 



PARATROPES Serville. 

 Paratropes subsericeus Saussure. 



1864. Paratropes subsericeus Saussure, Mem. I'Hist. Nat. Mex., 3me Mem., 

 p. 63. [Surinam.] 



One female. 



This specimen is referred to subsericeus instead of elegans Bur- 

 meister, of which the former has been considered a synonym. The 

 description of elegans, although very brief, does not fully fit the speci- 

 men in hand, while that of subsericeus fully describes the individual 

 examined. The author does not assert that the two are distinct 

 species, but Saussure's name represents the type examined and Bur- 

 meister's does not. 



EPILAMPRA Burmeister. 

 Epilampra abortivipennis Rehn. 



1903. Epilampra abortivipenna Rehn, Trans. Amer. Ent. Soc, XXIX, p. 273. 

 [Bartica, British Guiana.] 



One female. 



The tjrpe of this species was erroneously described as a female, a 

 re-examination showing it to be a male. 



2 Miss. Scient. Mex., Orth., p. 69. 




270 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



The female is larger and bulkier than the male, but is otherwise very 

 similar. The supra-anal plate of the female is transverse, rounded and 

 with a moderately deep V-shaped median emargination, the cerci are 

 about equal to the supra-anal plate in length, subequal in the proximal 

 half, tapering in the distal half, supra-anal plate large, moderately 

 inflated, cereal sinuations slight, the apical margin arcuate. 



Measurements of Female. 



Length of body, 26 mm. 



Length of pronotum, 6.5 " 



Greatest width of pronotum, 8.3 " 



Length of tegmen, 18.5 " 



Greatest width of tegmen, 6.5 " 



Epilampra lucifuga Rehn. 



1903. Epilampra lucifuga Rehn, Trans. Amer. Ent. Soc, XXIX, p. 271. 

 [Southern British Guiana.] 



Three males, one female. 



The female is slightly larger than the type specimen, but otherwise 

 the series is perfectly typical of the species. 



The supra-anal plate of the male is rather produced, trigonal and 

 fissate mesacl with the incision a mere slit to very near the apex; cerci 

 about half again the length of the subgenital plate, tapering in the distal 

 two-thirds; subgenital plate not reaching the caudal margin of the 

 supra-anal plate, trigonal, supplied with lateral styles nearly a third 

 the length of the cerci. 



Measurements of Male. 



Length of body, 22.5 mm. 



Length of pronotum, 5.5 '' 



Greatest width of pronotum, 6.5 '' 



Length of tegmen, 21.2 " 



Greatest width of tegmen, 6 " 



Epilampra maculicollis (Serville). 



1839. Blatta maculicollis Serville, Orthopteres, p. 92. [Brazil.] 



One male, one female. 



The base color of these specimens is maize yellow, and between the 

 eyes the head bears dorsad a pair of tapering spots of mummy brown, ■ 

 ventrad a blotch of seal brown, which has laterad short bars of the 

 same color extending ventrad between the antennae. The pronotum 

 is very finely sprinkled with, and the delicate pattern traced, in vandyke 

 brown, while the tegmina have the discoidal and anal areas very thickly 

 flecked with large and small spots of burnt umber, the basal and costal 

 regions being comparatively clear with only small spots. 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 271 



Epilampra fusca Bruimer. 



1865. Epilamjyra fusca Brunner, Nouv. Syst. Blatt., p. 170. [^'enezuela.] 



One female. 



As far as can be determined from Brimner's description, which was 

 based on a mutilated specimen, this individual appears to represent 

 the species. 



The color pattern is rather regular and typical of the genus, the 

 maculations of the tegmina being uniformly distributed but larger in 

 the discoidal field, while the whole insect has a strong suffusion of raAv 

 sienna. The head bears two spots of seal brown between the eyes, 

 these spots being connected by a line of the same color which encloses 

 a quadrate area between the antennae.

These specimens have a dark brown patch on the caudal section of 

 the disk, and the caudal margin of the pronotum is narrowly suffused 

 with the same color. This pattern of coloration is evidently present 

 in the type of Fabricius as he states: "Thorax ferrugineus, nitidus 

 macula baseos nigra." The golden hairs which are present on the 

 lighter sections of the pronotum are also distributed over the brown 

 area.

One female. 



This specimen is the first of a number of individuals of this section 

 of the genus examined by the author, which appears to fit Erichson's 

 very poor description. The pronotal maculation is confluent laterad 

 with the blackish caudal margin. This character appears to be what 

 Erichson refers to in " Der Halsschild mit spitzer gerundeten Seiten, 

 auf dem Riicken mit einigen kleinen, unbestimmten schwarzen Flecken, 

 dagegen der Hinterrand breit schwarz gesaumt." The figm*e of B. 

 thoracicus given by Saussure and Zehntner represents very nearly the 

 same thing, but a specimen from Costa Rica which I had considered 

 thoracicus ^ has these lateral bars lacking. Kirby's synonymizing of

the two species would appear, from the evidence in hand, to be correct^ 

 The author's B. hiolleyi * differs from posticus in the paler coloration, 

 the more numerous and finer veins of the anal area of the tegmen and 

 the separate and distinctly outlined maculations of the pronotum.

 Angela guianensis n. sp. 



Types: c? and ? ; Demarara, British Guiana. 1901. (R.J. Crew.) 



Closely allied to A. quinquemaculata (St oil) from Cayenne, but dif- 

 fering in the coloration of the wings in both sexes, particularly in the 

 absence of yellow in the male, and also in the short tegmina and wings 

 of the female. From brachyptera (Stoll) it can be separated by the 

 unspined margins of the caudal section of the pronotum and the tuber- 

 culate abdomen, as well as the color of the wings of the male. The 

 coloration of the wings of fulgida-yand trifasciata readily separates the 

 new form from these species. 



Size rather large; form as usual in the genus, male bacilliform with 

 elongate tegmina and wings, female^elongate with quite short tegmina 

 and wings; surface smooth but not polished. 



(^ . Head strongly transverse, occipital outline straight except for a 

 pair of slight lateral depressions; eyes prominent, ovoid in outline 

 when viewed laterad, rounded and projecting slightly cephalad of the 

 general level of the face but nearly plane caudad; ocelli large, elliptical, 

 placed in a low, broad triangle; facial scutellum arcuate transverse, 

 the arcuation dorsad; antennae as long as the head and pronotum 

 together, moderately serrulate. Pronotum with the coxal dilation 

 slight, subequal cephalad and caudad of the same; lateral margins of 

 the collar distinctly dentate, of the shaft slightly dentate cephalad, 

 smooth caudad; median carina distinct throughout the length of the 

 pronotum but quite delicate on the collar, the shaft compressed trigonal 

 in section. Tegmina slightly longer than the head and pronotum, 

 when in repose reaching nearly to the tip of the third abdominal seg- 

 ment; margins subparallel, apex rounded acute-angulate, the sutural 

 margin being considerably trimmed toward the apex; costal field 

 moderately expanded proximad and very gradually narrowing distad ;

ulnar vein with three almost parallel rami, stigma distinct. Wings 

 exceeding the tegmina by about a third the length of the pronotum, 

 slightly longer than twice the width; costal margin nearly straight, 

 apex rather narrowly rounded. Cephalic coxse slightly less than half 

 the length of pronotum, not armed ; cephalic femora about five-eighths 

 the length of the pronotum, the ventro-caudal margin bearing four 

 large and one small distal spines, the ventro-cephalic margin armed 

 with two grades of spines, the larger size numbering six and the smaller 

 eight, the smaller being placed one each between the larger spines, 

 except that distad of the distal large spine two small ones are present 

 and between the first and second distal spines three are present, dis- 

 coidal spines four in number; cephalic tibiee (exclusive of terminal 

 claw) less than a third the femoral length, the cephalic margin with 

 sixteen spines increasing in size distad, caudal margin with five spines; 

 tarsi about equal to the tibiae in length. Median and caudal limbs 

 very slender but not greatly elongate, the caudal femora not quite 

 reaching the middle of the third abdominal segment. 



General color Prout's brown. Tegmina hyaline washed narrowly 

 along the sutiu-al margin (distad of the dividing vein) and very broadly 

 along the costal margin with Prout's brown, the greater portion of all 

 the longitudinal veins being marked with numerous fine linear seal 

 brown touches. Wings with proximal half hyaline, the apex of the 

 anterior field yellowish coriaceous, the remainder vandyke brown with 

 very strong violet reflections, this coloration also extending nearly to 

 the base as a varying line along the mediastine vein, the caudal section 

 of the broad transverse bar extending clear to the margin, and broken 

 only by less infuscate areas immediately surrounding the radiate veins 

 and the clear pattern of the transverse veins. 



? . Head much as in the male, facial scutellum slightly less arcuate ; 

 antennse very short, hardly exceeding the length of the collar of the 

 pronotum, filiform. Pronotum with the collar nearly a fifth the length 

 of the whole pronotum, coxal dilation slight; collar slightly tapering 

 cephalad, the cephalic angle narrowly rounded and with an apparent 

 elevation caused by a marked depression of the collar immediately cau- 

 dad ; lateral margins of the collar dentate, shaft with the margins un- 

 armed; median carina distinct on the collar and on the cephalic and 

 caudal sections of the shaft, collar trigonal in cross section, shaft rounded 

 dorsad. Tegmina about a fifth the length of the pronotum, reaching in 

 repose to about the middle of the first abdominal segment, margins very 

 slightly approximate distad; apex broadly rounded, stigma distinct. 

 Wings in repose extending beyond the tegmina by not quite a third

the length of the latter, the length but slightly greater than the 

 length of the tegmen. Abdomen with the apex broad, depressed, 

 the three terminal segments with very distinct median longitudinal 

 marginal folds; supra-anal plate about as long as broad, the distal 

 portion rounded; cerci broad, lamellate and truncate as usual in the 

 genus; subgenital plate strongly compressed, rostrate, diverted ven- 

 trad out of the general abdominal plane. Cephalic coxae slightly 

 less than half the length of the pronotum, slightly armed, distal section 

 expanded and compressed, being abruptly trigonal in section, while 

 the proximal three-fom-ths is transverse in section; cephalic femora 

 slightly more than half the length of the pronotum, the margins armed 

 as in the male except that the cephalic margin has one or tw6 

 additional spines of the second order; tibiae and tarsi as in the male. 

 Median and caudal limbs slender but not greatly elongate. 



General color tawny-olive finely washed, spotted and sprinkled with 

 Front's brown; eyes marked with seal brown. Pronotum with the 

 two colors showing very distinctly in a pattern which is pardaline in 

 ■character, the shaft with its cephalic fifth inclined toward bistre. 

 Tegraina tawny-olive in the proximal half, becoming brick red in the 

 distal half, the costal section Front's brown, some of the rami of the 

 ulnar vein and the dividing vein with short fine linear touches of bistre, 

 the folded proximal section blackish purple. Wings with the anterior 

 field broccoli brown, yellowish along the costal margin and rich brick 

 red in the distal third ; posterior field with the base color purplish brown 

 with a very strong purplish-blue sheen, bearing two irregular maculations 

 of lemon yellow, limited to about the cephalic half of the field and each 

 bearing distad an area of equal size of the clear base color of the area, the 

 whole wing except these areas and the semi-coriaceous red section of 

 the anterior field having all the transverse veins white or yellowish- 

 white. Abdomen of the general color; limbs of the general color with 

 the pardaline appearance distinctly marked on the median and caudal 

 limbs.

Type: 9 ; Demerara, British Guiana. 1901. (R. J. Crew.) 



Not closely allied to any previously known species of the genus, dif- 

 fering in the absence of spines and in the lobation of the median and 

 caudal femora. This species may not be true Ceroys, but it does not 

 belong to any of the present allied genera. 



Size median; form moderately robust; surface smooth, not polished, 

 unarmed. Head rather long, subequal caudad of the eyes, occiput with 

 a faint median longitudinal impressed line and several very weak ones 

 laterad; eyes subglobose, moderately prominent; antennae filiform, 

 about equal to the head and thorax in length, the proximal joint de- 

 pressed. Pronotum nearly half again as long as broad, the lateral mar- 

 gins somewhat incurved, cephalic margin moderately concave, caudal 

 margin arcuate, transverse depression distinct, arcuate caudad, median 

 longitudinal depression very faint and incomplete. Mesonotum five and 

 a half times the length of the pronotum, a distinct dorsal line present 

 but no carina. Metanotum (including median segment) about five- 

 eighths the length of the mesonotum, the median segment very dis- 

 tinctly longer than broad and exceeding the length of the remainder of 

 the metanotum. Abdomen distinctly exceeding the remainder of the 

 body in length; four proximal joints simple, longitudinal and very 

 slightly increasing in length distad; fifth segment expanded meso- 

 caudad, in length about ec^ual to the fourth segment; sixth segment 

 simple, slightly shorter than the first proximal segment; seventh seg- 

 ment two-thirds the length of the sixth, somewhat expanded caudad; 

 eighth segment slightly shorter than the seventh ; ninth segment shorter 

 than the eighth, compressed, carinate dorsad, narrowly emarginate 

 caudad; supra-anal plate with the angulate tip alone visible; cerci 

 compressed, tapering, blunt, the length about two- thirds that of the 

 ninth dorsal segment; subgenital opercule boat-shaped, carinate in the 

 distal half, lanceolate, acute, not exceeding the tips of the cerci. Limbs 

 multicarinate, robust. Cephalic femora about as long as the mesono- 

 tum, compressed, basal flexure very marked and abrupt, the two 

 prominent dorsal and single ventral carina lamellato-carinate ; cephalic 

 tibise about equal to the femora in length and with three lamellate 

 carinse; tarsi with the proximal joint slightly longer than the remaining 

 joints. Median femora slightly shorter than the metanotum, the two

ventral lamellate carinse each with a prominent proximal and distal 

 rounded foliaceous lobe, the dorso-cephalic carina also with a low 

 proximal lobe; median tibiae about as long as the femora, the ventral 

 carinse lamellate, but no lobes present; median tarsi with the proximal 

 joint about equal to the remaining joints. Caudal femora as long as 

 the proximal two and a half abdominal segments, in structure similar 

 to the median but with the dorsal lobe even smaller; caudal tibise 

 slightly longer than the femora, in structure similar to the median tibise 

 but slightly slenderer; caudal tarsi with the proximal joint distinctly 

 but not greatly longer than the remaining joints.

FURTHER KNOWLEDGE OF SOME HETEROGNATHOUS FISHES. PART I. 

 BY HENRY W. FOWLER. 



In this paper I have attempted to arrange systematically the Heter- 

 ognathi contained in the collections of the Academy of Natviral Sciences 

 of Philadelphia. This group is largely made up of collections formed 

 by John Hauxwell, James Orton and H. H. Smith. Nearly all of 

 Cope's typical specimens, besides a number of comparatively rare or 

 obscurely defined species, are represented. Owing to the increase in 

 knowledge of the vast fresh-water ichthyic fauna of South America, it 

 is believed that further detailed information concerning rare, nominal 

 or species only known from the original specimens will be welcomed.

Cope's statements that ' ' the depth at the front of the dorsal fin is 

 one-third the length of the caudal ' ' and ' ' the length of the head is one-

All have the dark caudal spot evident, and in the larger ones it is very 

 distinct. In some small ones it is preceded laterally and medianly 

 by an irregular series of small blackish spots of uneven size. In others 

 this is connected by a dusky streak, fading out anteriorly and enclosing 

 the lateral line. In fact the species shows considerable color variation. 

 Also a large uniformly colored example from Campos, Brazil. The 

 proportions, etc., of all the examples range as follows: Head 3 to 31; 

 depth 2f to 3; D. iii, 9; A. iii, 7, i; scales 33 to 38 in lateral line to base 

 of caudal and 3 or 4 continued on the latter; 6 or 7 scales, usually 6, 

 obliquely back from origin of dorsal to lateral line; 6 scales obliquely 

 between lateral line and origin of ventral; 14 to 16 scales before dorsal; 

 total length of specimens ranging from 2\ to 8^ inches.

In view of the uncertainty of identification of Salmo edentulus Bloch, 

 which is more like the example I shall identify as Curimata schom- 

 hurgkii, I have allowed this subgenus to fall with it and related species. 

 Further, its identification with Salmo cyprinoides Linnaeus may be 

 questioned, and if any credit is attached to Bloch's figure the scales are 

 a little large.

Besides the above are 5 examples from the Ambyiacu river in the 

 Hauxwell collection. Cope's label reads ' ' Curimatus rutiloides. ' ' An 

 examination of the air-vessels of two of these examples shows that it 

 persists nearly as far posteriorly till opposite base of penultimate anal 

 ray. It is thus apparent that Cope may have intended all the ex- 

 amples before me to represent his C. rutiloides, but the original labels 

 in his own handwriting would lead to the above allocating of the 

 references. The form called Psedrogaster amazonica by Dr. and Mrs. 

 Eigenmann I cannot distinguish in my examples.

With reference to the original description, Cope evidently intended 

 to state that the base of the first dorsal ray was three millimeters nearer 

 the end of the muzzle than the base of the caudal. Both pectorals and 

 ventrals reach m.ore than half way in the spaces stated. Cope evi-

Formerly identified by Cope with Prochilodus insignis Kner, this 

 species may at least provisionally be regarded as distinct. This is in 

 view of the identity of Prochilodus insignis Jardine and P. insignis of 

 Kner, and later of Dr. Glinther, not yet having been proved. Schom- 

 burgk's figure, as presented by Jardine, shows each lobe of the caudal 

 with five oblique bands besides the median one, which is also in agree- 

 ment in the description. Dr. Giinther's Amazon examples are said to 

 have only three or four bands across each lobe besides the median one.

Prochilodus iheraponura may thus be said to differ from all of the 

 others in the fact that it has but two obUque dark bars on the caudal, 

 aside from the median one.

This species is also apparently closely related to Prochilodus ijisignis 

 Jardine, but differs in the fewer blackish bars on the caudal lobes. It 

 will possibly prove identical with the examples recorded by Dr. Giinther 

 which have three dark bars on each caudal lobe.

The main character advanced for the nominal genus Chorimycterus, 

 i.e., the presence of biserial mandibular teeth, is entirely fallacious, as 

 both of the cotypes before me have but a single series in the mandible. 

 It is therefore a synonym of Characidium.

 extending from base of pectoral to origin of anal. Top of head with 

 indistinct brownish spots. Dorsal blackish with a broad transverse 

 whitish band below middle. Length 2f inches. 



Castelnau figures Leporinus vittatus Valenciennes, which will be seen 

 to differ at once in the coloration. It shows each scale of the back 

 marked with a single black spot and the dorsal crossed by a blackish 

 transverse band a little above its middle. The side of the head is 

 spotted, and there are also no traces on the trunk of the dark contrasted 

 color-pattern which my example now shows. Kner's figure of Leporinus 

 pidus agrees better, and though it differs according to the figm-e in 

 having a pale dorsal marked above and in front with a dark blotch, 

 another or basal one is mentioned in the description. The figure 

 also shows no trace of the lower dusky line seen on my example, 

 which extends from the pectoral to the anal. Dr. Steindachner 

 records a large example from Cauca which had both dorsal and anal 

 fins marked with blackish bands.

Although the name Tetragonoptenis finitimus was originally proposed 

 by Bocourt {Ann. Sci. Nat. Paris, Zool, 5, IX, 1868, p. 62), his account 

 is entirely too brief and imperfect to permit identification. Prof. 

 Vaillant and Dr. Pellegrin next describe examples from Guatemala 

 which they identify with this species and w^hich seem to agree with 

 my own specimens.

 A very large series of examples of most all ages from Rio Ixtla at 

 Puente de Ixtla, Morelos, and Rio Verde near Rascon, Mexico. These 

 collected and presented by Profs. Jordan and Snyder. Also a large 

 series from Monterey, Mexico, from Prof. E. D. Cope, and others from 

 the same evidently from Mexico. Others from Del Rio and Devil's river, 

 Texas, from Dr. H. A. Pilsbry. All show the following: Head 3 to 4; 

 depth 2^ to 3f ; D. in, 9, though sometimes ii or in, 8, and rarely in, 

 10; A. ni to iv, 17, i to 24, i, usually 21 or 20, frequently 19 or 22,

 35, frequently 34 or 36, and rarely 32, 33 or 37 ; 7 or 8 scales in an oblique

series back from origin of dorsal to lateral line; 6 scales from base of 

 ventral in a vertical series to lateral line, sometimes 7, rarely 5, and 

 same between origin of anal and lateral line; 13 to 19 scales before 

 dorsal, usually 15 to 16, less frequently 14 or 17, and rarely 13, 18- or 

 19; eye 2^ to 3^ in head, measured from tip of upper jaw, larger 

 measiu-ements in young; length of specimens ly^g- to 4f inches. 



Astyanax ceneus (Giinther) is a closely related species differing 

 chiefly in the absence of maxillary teeth, according to Dr. Meek's 

 account. The other characters are seen to be more or less correlated, 

 as several of my examples of A. mexicanus which possess as many as 24 

 developed or branched anal rays (would be 26 or 27 evidently according 

 to Dr. ]\Ieek's count) also have well-developed basal maxillary teeth. 



A number of examples, possibly cotypical of Tetragonopterus streetsii 

 Cope, have uncertain data. They are included in the above measure- 

 ments, and are Nos. 32,371 to 32,426, A. N. S. P.

Head 3^; depth 2f ; D. iii, 9; A. iv, 26; scales 34 in lateral Hne to 

 base of caudal, and 3 more on latter; 6 scales in an obliquely vertical 

 series from origin of dorsal to lateral line; 6 scales in a nearly vertical 

 series from origin of ventral to lateral line; 14 scales before dorsal; 

 snout 4 in head, measured from tip of snout ; eye 3 ; interorbital space 2§ ; 

 least depth of caudal peduncle 2J; pectoral 1^ in head, from tip of 

 mandible; ventral If. Several minute maxillary teeth. Rakers 

 about 9 + 15 on first arch, those on ceratobranchial largest, though 

 shorter than filaments. Each scale of body with several striae. Pos- 

 terior distal extremity of maxillary extending back till opposite pupil. 

 Humeral and caudal spots pale. Rather broad pale or silvery band on 

 side of trunk evident. Iris brassy-brown and side of head silvery. 

 Length 2|- inches. One example. 



I accept the above name, as Dr. Giinther pointed out the inconsist- 

 encies of Cuvier's figure and description, also when compared with 

 other accounts. The examples identified by Prof. Ulrey {Ann. N. Y. 

 Acad. Sci., VIII, 1893-95, p. 284) as Tetragonopterus fasciatus (Cuvier), 

 and credited to Dr. Eigenmann, with the developed anal rays 19 to 25, 

 would seem to indicate a rather unusual range of variation.

 A few strige on each scale. Color in alcohol pale brownish, back darker

 of caudal, also extending out on median rays of latter. Fins pale 

 brownish. Eyes silvered. Length 2^^ inches (caudal damaged).

The other examples all show: Head 3^ to 3^; depth 2f to 2f ; D. iii. 

 9, rarely ii, 8; A. iv, 21, i or iv, 22, i, usually latter; scales 30 to 3-1 

 in lateral line to base of caudal and 2 or 3 on latter ; 6 scales obliquely 

 back from origin of dorsal to lateral line; 5 or 6 scales from origin of 

 ventral to lateral line in a vertical series; 13 to 15 scales before dorsal, 

 usually 14; eye 2f to 2| in head ; total length of examples 2 to 2f inches. 



This form has been united with Astyanax fasciatus (Cuvier) by Prof. 

 Ulrey. The above characters will show that it had at least best be 

 regarded as distinct, if only provisionalh'. Further, it may be stated 

 as differing principally from A. fasciatus in the fewer anal radii. All of 

 the above characters are also constant, and it is possible to separate 

 these specimens from those representing Astyanax laticeps, as Cope 

 rightly determined. I shall therefore be obliged to remove the latter 

 from the synonymy of A. fasciatus, where it has also been placed by 

 Prof. Ulrey, as it differs principally in still fewer anal radii. Thus 

 from an examination of the material before me I shall refuse to con- 

 sider A. eigenmanniorum and A. laticeps either as variations of A. 

 fasciatus or in fact either as the same species. Finally Cope's descrip- 

 tion and figure of A. eigenmanniorum may hardly be styled excellent, 

 much less that it leaves little doubt that the fish in question is simply 

 a variation of T. fasciatus.

Cope was evidently in error in stating that the humeral and caudal

indistinct, and the median caudal rays are darker than the rest of the 



caudal fin. There is also a dull brownish shade at the base of the 



caudal. Outer portions of dorsal, caudal and anal brownish, not

DESCRIPTIONS OF TWO NEW POLYCHJSTA FROM ALASKA. 

 BY J. PERCY MOORE. 



Among a number of Alaskan Polychseta in the collections of this 

 Academy, the two of which the descriptions follow are new. 



Syllis quaternaria sp. nov. 



This sexual free-swimming form of the type for which Malmgren 

 instituted his genus Chcetosyllis is probably the epitokous form of a 

 true Syllis, but it cannot be correlated with any atokous form hitherto 

 described. 



The length varies from 7 to 9 mm.; the width between the ends of 

 the parapodia is .8 mm. and between the tips of the capillary setsB 4.5 

 mm., or one-half the length of the body. 



Syllis quaternaria. — a, dorsal view of prostomium, peristomium and first two 

 somites bearing capillary setse, X 24; 6, parapodium from IX with setse cut 

 off, X 32 ; c, a long and d, a short notopodial seta from X, X 600. 



The prostomium (a) consists of a pair of prominent hemispherical 

 lobes separated by a deep, narrow, median cleft, and each again divided 

 by a shallow transverse groove. A pair of simple unjointed or obscurely 

 wrinkled cylindrical tentacles arise from the latter grooves and 

 incline decidedly toward the dorsum. They reach a length of 1|- to 1-J 

 times the prostomium. No other cephalic appendages exist, but there 

 are two pairs of dense, black or deep brown, short spindle-shaped eyes, 

 each provided with a small cuticular lens. The dorsal eyes are the 

 more posterior and look vertically upwards ; the large ventral pair look 

 downwards, forwards and outwards. Sometimes 1 or 2 small, rod-like 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 353 



bodies of pigment occur with the eyes. The mouth is a minute open- 

 ing situated at the very bottom of the vertical prostomial cleft near the 

 ventral surface. 



The peristomium (a) is but little modified and a segment just like 

 the others, except that the parapodia lack the capillary setae. The 

 sides of the body are nearly parallel almost to the caudal end, where the 

 last 12 to 15 of the total number of 40 to 43 segments taper to the 

 pygidium. Each segment is about ^ as long as wide, or anteriorly 

 rather more than this. The small triangular pygidium bears a pair 

 of large, stout moniliform cirri of about 25 joints, and in the males an 

 additional short, slender, and un jointed median ventral cirrus. 



Excepting the first pair the parapodia (b) are biramous, and all but 

 the first and the last few bear capillary setse in the notopodium. The 

 basal part is a rather large dome-shaped structure, from which the 

 neuropodium projects rather prominently and ends in a short, slightly 

 curved dorsal acicular process, while a postsetal lamina, stepped at the 

 ends for the rows of setae, forms its more ventral portion. Two or 

 three straight aciculi support the neuropodium. From the middle of 

 the ventral surface of the foot arises a short, slender, tapered and un- 

 jointed ventral cirrus. The notopodium is a very slight, conical tu- 

 bercle which receives the end of a single aciculum strongly curved at the 

 tip and caps a large yellowish setigerous sac, from which the capillary 

 setae spring. Well above and separated from this tubercle arises the 

 dorsal cirrus, which is always prominent and strongly moniliform. 

 With considerable regularity the dorsal cirri are alternately longer and 

 shorter, the even numbers being about equal to f of the width of the 

 body exclusive of the parapodia and consisting of 20 to 25 joints, 

 whereas the odd numbers are about f as long as they and have only 14 

 to 16 joints. 



As stated above, all but the peristomium and the last 5 or 6 segments 

 bear capillary notopodial setae which form dense and very conspicuous 

 bundles. They are perfectly smooth and simple in structure, glass- 

 like in appearance, tapered to excessively fine but apparently flattened 

 ends, and are more or less curved and sometimes curled and twisted at 

 the ends — the latter condition being probably the result of preserva- 

 tion. 



Neuropodial setae are arranged in 5 or 6 horizontal sub-acicular rows. 

 They are relatively short and stout and perfectly colorless and vitreous. 

 The curved stems are deeply cupped, and toothed along the more pro- 

 longed side. The blades end in a single, rather stout, little hooked 

 tooth, and the dorsal or shorter side is provided with a moderately 




354 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



strong fringe best developed on the shorter blades, which also exhibit 

 an aggregation of some of the terminal hairs to simulate an accessory 

 tooth. On the ventral setae the blades seldom exceed a length of twice 

 the diameter of the end of the shaft, while those of the 3 or 4 setas in 

 the dorsalmost row are narrower and 4 or 5 times as long as the distal 

 end of the shaft. 



Although all of the specimens examined are fully mature and have 

 the body cavity filled with ova or sperm, the alimentary canal is com- 

 plete and well developed, extending continuously from mouth to 

 anus without exhibiting any of that occlusion or degeneration seen in 

 many sexually mature syllids and other annelids. 



The type and about a score of cotypes are No. 1,091 of the Academy's 

 collections. Taken on the "surface in a lead 4 miles from shore by 

 Mr. E. A. Mcllhenny at Point Barrow, Alaska." 



Ammotrypane brevis sp. nov. 



The type of this species is a somewhat contracted specimen 15 mm. 

 long, 1.5 mm. broad and 1.9 mm. high in the middle, being therefore 

 rather robust and tapering to both ends. The general resemblance to 

 A. aulogaster is close, but if the differences exhibited by the single speci- 

 men prove to be constant the two species are readily separated. 



Ammotrypane 6re)'/s.— Parapodium and gill from somite X, X 56. 



Instead of being laterally compressed the prostomium is blunt and 

 flattened dorso-ventrally. From it a slight median ridge passes back- 

 ward and gradually merges into the dorsal curvature of the back. 

 Below this ridge on each side are the small sensory pits or nuchal 

 organs. The mouth is a small trifid opening bounded by a pair of 

 small anterior lobes and a single posterior lobe. Although the body 

 seems to be quite complete and exhibits no indications of regeneration, 

 there are only 29 setigerous somites not distinguishable from one 

 another externally except through the presence of the parapodia. No 

 intersegmental furrows whatever are discernible and the segments pass 

 continuously into one another. Ventrally a pair of stout muscular 

 bands, separated by a deep median groove, produce a somewhat sole- 

 like surface. Above this the body is narrower and strongly arched 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 355 



and marked only by the small transverse muscle bundles, apparently 



4 to each segment. 



If perfect, as it appears to be, the pygidium presents striking char- 

 acteristics. The large median spoon-shaped lobe of A. aulogaster is 

 absent and represented only by a minute slender process. The 

 lateral lobes are much larger, obliquely truncated above, and slightly 

 indented at the end. 



The parapodia arise from the dorso-lateral surface of the lateral 

 muscle bands and are about equally well developed throughout. 

 They form small but distinct bluntly rounded tubercles produced 

 into a small, conical prominence and apparently unsupported by an 

 aciculum. They bear only a small ventral cirrus and a prominent 

 dorsal branchia, the small dorsal cirrus which has been figured for 

 some species being absent. Branchise are absent from the first pair 

 of parapodia, but are present on all of the others. They are largest 

 on the middle segments, where they exceed a millimeter in length and 

 the parapodium in diameter. They are slender and slightty tapering in 

 form and provided along one side with a strongly developed longitudi- 

 nal muscle, rendering them very contractile. 



The setae are all simple, colorless, tapering, capillary bristles, longi- 

 tudinally fibrillated and soft in texture. They are arranged in two 

 fascicles, a dorsal of 6 to 10 setse which reach f the length of the 

 branchia, from the base of which they arise, and a ventral which arises 

 from beneath the conical prolongation of the parapodium and contains 



5 or 6 setae less than h as long as the dorsal bristles. 



Along the sides of the body between the parapodia, but nearest to the 

 succeeding one, are small black or dark brown and very conspicuous 

 eye spots, which are hemispherical in shape and indistinctly facetted on 

 the surface. 



The only specimen, a female filled with eggs, is No. 284 of the Acad- 

 emy's collection, taken by Dr. Benjamin Sharp at Icy Cape, Alaska, 

 on August 17, 1895.

NOTE ON THE DUSKY SALAMANDER. 

 BY HENRY W. FOWLER. 



Near Port Allegany, in McKean county, and in the valleys of the 

 headwaters of the Genesee, Allegheny and Susquehanna, in Potter 

 county. Pa., Mr. T. D. Keim and the writer spent a few days, studying 

 the fauna, in the summers of 1904 and 1906. Most of the hemlock 

 forests have been cleared off, except near Port Allegany, where one 

 still has but a short time left to study the animal life in its primeval 

 conditions. 



Perhaps the most abundant in individuals among cold-blooded verte- 

 brates was the little dusky salamander, Desmognathus fusca. It was 

 found nearly everywhere in the valleys, about and in streams, and on 

 the comparatively dry mountain-tops, though there less numerous 

 and more solitary. About the headwaters of the Genesee they were 

 even more abundant, so that we had the opportunity of examining 

 multitud&s of living examples. So abundant were they in some 

 localities that as many as four or five would frequently occur under a 

 single small stone. Owing to the nature of the brooks about the 

 Genesee headwaters, which are very swift, cold and sinking out of 

 sight in some places to appear again in others, very favorable habitats 

 are secured in the comparatively damp intercovirses which are only 

 flooded in times of heavy rains. 



Very great range in color-pattern and color-variation was noted in 

 this species. Young an inch long had the pale area on the back more 

 or less immaculate pink or pale brown. The uppermost of the accom- 

 panying figures, Plate XIII, indicates this type. They varied from these 

 shades into the dusky-black adults. They did not always appear to 

 change from pinkish to brown, as some with pink backs were found 

 equally as large as the larger brownish ones. The pale colors of the 

 back were not always immaculate, many being variously blotched 

 or speckled with darker or brownish. Very dark or blackish examples, 

 not larger than the largest pink or brown ones, also occurred, though 

 these all showed traces to some extent of the dorsal color-pattern. 

 Most all full-grown examples lose every trace of the dorsal color-pattern 

 in the blackish of the back. 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 357 



A comparison of the types of Desmognathus ochrophcea Cope seems to 

 leave it perfectly clear that it is nothing more than the intermediate 

 brown color-variety of D. fusca, which I have represented in the tw^o 

 lower median accompanying figures. The identity of D. ochrophcea 

 with D. fusca, however, was fii-st suggested by Mr. G. M. Allen in the 

 Proc. Bost. Soc. N. H., 29, 1901, p. 73. In view of the material ex- 

 amined I am now able to fully endorse Mr. Allen's view as final. 

 The characters pointed out by Cope in 1889 are certainly not of specific 

 value as they range more or less through most of my material. The 

 habitat of the ochrophcea stage is not confined entirely to the mountain- 

 tops, as the animals are found under damp stones about streams and 

 in the valleys. I do not agree with Cope's suggestion that Salamandra 

 haldemani Holbrook is "an unusually spotted Spelerpes hilineatus'' as 

 the tail is somewhat short. It agrees with some of my examples of 

 D. fusca to some extent in the color of the belly, which is usually more 

 or less livid in life. It had best be regarded as a synonym of D. fusca. 



As small and medium-sized examples greatly resemble Plethodon 

 erythronotus, which is rather abundant in the dry forests, a good char- 

 acter for distinguishing the two species at a glance will be found in the 

 pale or whitish streak extending down from the eye behind. This is 

 present on most all examples and may frequently be traced to some 

 extent in the blackish adults.

A CONTRIBUTION TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORTHOPTERA OF MONTANA, 

 YELLOWSTONE PARK, UTAH AND COLORADO. 



BY JAMES A. G. REHN AND MORGAN HEBARD. 



During the month of August, 1904, the junior, author was occupied 

 in collecting Orthoptera at a number of localities extending from 

 eastern Montana to Salt Lake City, and from that locality to east- 

 central Colorado. Collecting at some localities was limited to a few 

 minutes search permitted by the stoppage of the train, at other locali- 

 ties several days were spent and very extensive and interesting collec- 

 tions made. The careful study of the Orthoptera of the Yellowstone 

 Park and of Pike's Peak yielded some interesting and scarce species, 

 as well as two new forms and a considerable amount of information on 

 the habitat and actions of a number of species. 



The number of specimens in the collection studied is about 2,800, 

 and 121 species are represented. Notes on the habits and other infor- 

 mation has been given under most of the species by the collector, 

 and the chief localities visited have been briefly described, to aid in 

 a proper understanding of their conditions and environmental features 

 as well as to aid future students in this region. 



A considerable representation of the species treated in this paper 

 has been placed in the Academy's collection by the junior author. 



Montana. 



Waco, Yellowstone Co., elevation 2,700 feet. On the sage-brush 

 plains just east of the foothills of the Rockies. 



Grey Cliff, Sweetgrass Co., elevation 3,900 feet. In a more rugged 

 character of country than Waco but with a similar vegetation. 

 Orthoptera appeared to swarm as the specimens collected were taken 

 in less than two minutes. 



Billings, Yelloivstone Co., elevation 3,115 fe^t. Specimens taken 

 here were from the dusty main street of the town. 



Livingston, Park Co., elevation 4,488 feet. Material from this 

 locality was taken among weeds growing in a vacant lot near the 

 station. 



Emigrant, Daileys, Sphinx and Electric, Park Co., elevation 4,800- 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 359 



5, 1 00 feet. Dming the brief stops made by the train between Livingston 

 and Gardiner a httle collecting was possible. These stations are 

 situated in the valley of the Yellowstone river between the Snowy 

 Jlountains and the Gallatin Range. The vegetation is chiefly sage- 

 brush and other plants which grow in a semi-arid soil. Orthoptera 

 were very plentiful, and had time allowed a great quantity could easily 

 have been taken. 



Muir, Bozeman Tunnel, Park Co., elevation 5,49G feet. At this 

 point a few minutes' stop afforded an opportunity to collect in the 

 heavy growth of weeds and grasses along the track. The vegetation 

 was very luxuriant and wholly different from that found in the semi- 

 arid sections. The Orthoptera of regions of this character was always 

 much less abundant than in the sage-brush country. 



Three Forks, Willotv Creek and Sappington, Gallatin Co., and Jefferson 

 City and Whitehall, Jefferson Co., elevation 4,061-4,529 feet. During 

 the brief stops made at these towns a few specimens were taken. 

 The soil w^as barren and Orthoptera was far less plentiful than in the 

 more eastern portion of the State. 



Spire Rock, Jefferson Co., elevation 5,217 feet. Among the great 

 boulders on the summit of the mountains near Butte a few specimens 

 were seen and hardly any vegetation found. This locality was by far 

 the most desolate of any at which collecting was done. 



Yellowstone Park. 



Mammoth Hot Springs, elevation 6,215-7,000 feet. At Fort Yellow- 

 stone, where the Mammoth Hot Springs are situated, a great variety 

 of collecting grounds are within easy reach. About the fort itself, 

 among the weeds and grasses, Orthoptera were not very plentiful ; but 

 immediately behind the hotel, in the dense sage-brush growing on the 

 sides of the foothills, vast quantities of Orthoptera of many species 

 were to be found. Collecting here was somewhat difficult owing to the 

 steep hillside and the agility of the majority of the species, as well as 

 the difficulty of following more interesting specimens on account of 

 the quantities of more common species which everyw^here swarmed. 

 At a greater elevation on the sides of these hills the sage-brush gave 

 place somew^hat to grasses and other low growing plants, where Orthop- 

 tera were less prevalent but more desirable. On the summits, however, 

 the ground was pebbly and overgrown with sparse and stunted grasses, 

 in which situations many most desirable species were abundant and 

 could be easily taken in the scanty vegetation. In one grass}^ hollow 

 near the top of the foothills, among scattered bushes near a thicket 




360 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



of aspen, I found species which did not seem present in the surrounding 

 sections, among which were Hippiscus maculatus, Circotettix rabula, 

 Bradynotes ohesa and Mdanoplus alpinus. 



At the head of the hot springs I found a plot of marsh grass among 

 the stunted pines which revealed several species of crickets and other 

 Orthopterous insects not found in the surrounding country. On the 

 summits of the higher foothills nearby an even greater variety of the 

 more interesting forms were found. 



Apollinaris Spring, elevation 7,250 feet. iMaterial collected here 

 was from dense pine woods. 



Fountain, Lower Geyser Basin, elevation 7,230 feet. Very few 

 specimens could be found here, the pine woods nearby revealing 

 nothing whatever, while but very few individuals were taken on the 

 geyser formation and in the short grass near the hotel. This was the 

 most unfavorable locality found in the Park. 



Old Faithftd Inn, Upper Geyser Basin, elevation 7,830 feet. Here 

 two distinct collecting localities were accessible in which few though 

 interesting forms were found. Between Old Faithful geyser and the 

 Firehole river a space of short grass contained numerous Arphia 

 pseudonietana, while on the surrounding geyser formations the same 

 species could be found in very small numbers. Back of the Inn, among 

 the short but thickly-growing pines, several species of Melanoplus 

 {M. hruneri and fasciatus) were found which were not met with else- 

 where in the Park. Unlike most of the Yellowstone localities, long and 

 diligent search was required to secure each specimen. 



Norris Pass, Continental Divide, elevation 8,240-8,320 feet. About 

 the Norris Pass the vegetation was scanty owing to the elevation. In 

 the more open spaces a short grass grew plentifully and several species 

 of Orthoptera could have been taken in numbers had time permitted. 



The Thumb, Yellowstone Lake. About The Thumb on the shore of 

 Yellowstone Lake the vegetation was heavy, but owing to the few 

 cleared spaces but few Orthoptera were found. 



Exit of the Yellowstone River, elevation 7,742 feet. At this point 

 above the high abrupt bank on the left side is a large treeless expanse 

 covered by high plants and shrubs. In this location all forms of insect 

 life were very plentiful, and many varieties of boreal Lepidoptera were 

 noticed. The Orthoptera of this section differed materially from 

 that found in the more arid geyser regions. 



Mud Volcano, elevation 7,740 feet. CoUecting here was done on 

 sandy soil. 



Near Grand Canon, elevation 8,000 feet. The country about the 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 361 



Grand Canon much resembled that about Yellowstone Lake, but 

 Orthoptera were less abundant. As in other parts of the Park, very 

 few specimens could be found in the woods, 



Utah. 



Vicinity of Salt Lake City, Salt Lake Co., elevation 4,230-6,000 feet. 

 About Salt Lake City I found the vicinity of Eixsign Peak (top 6,000 

 feet elevation) by far the most productive collecting groimd. There 

 the soil was dry and gravelly, but covered with a somewhat sturdy 

 growth of sage-brush and other desert plants. In this place Orthoptera 

 swarmed and great difficulty was experienced in following scarce 

 specimens among the legions of less desirable ones. About the foot 

 of the hill was the most productive situations, but great numbers were 

 found both on the hillside and at the top. 



In a dry field of cut alfalfa some miles south of the city (elevation 

 4,230 feet) collecting was profitable among the stubble, although both 

 there and in the surrounding countiy far fewer species were to be 

 found than w^as expected and nothing of the variety found in the more 

 barren region about Ensign Peak. 



Colorado. 



Grand Junction, Mesa Co., elevation 4,573 feet. In the dry sandy 

 country at this locality quite good collecting was found, though recent 

 freshets had washed over much of the groimd, and the only vegetation 

 in most places consisted of tall scraggy bushes. 



Antlers, Garfield Co., elevation 5,310 feet. An area of cactus and 

 sage at this locality proved very productive in the few minutes spent 

 there. 



Debeque, ]\Iesa Co., elevation 4,935 feet, and Newcastle, Garfield Co., 

 elevation 5,552 feet. Both localities in the rather arid canon of the 

 Grand River. 



Vicinity of Colorado Springs, El Paso Co. To the east of the city in 

 the prairie (elevation about 6,000 feet) Orthoptera w'ere present in 

 countless numbers. The true prairie-grass land revealed many species, 

 while the more luxuriant grass about a small stagnant pond produced 

 other species. This locality, while somew^hat dry, was nothing like the 

 parched sage-brush plains in which collecting was done at other places. 

 Austin Bluffs (elevation 6,960 feet) rise abruptlj^ from the prairie land, 

 many dry shrubs growing upon them, plentifully interspersed with 

 scrub pines. 



Vicinity of Manitou, El Paso Co. The mesa (elevation 6,400 feet) 




362 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



at this locality was somewhat like the prairie at Colorado Springs, but 

 not nearly as productive. On the hillside near the Pike's Peak railroad 

 station (elevation 6,700 feet) Orthoptera were plentiful among the 

 high grasses and scrub oak thickets. The Garden of the Gods (eleva- 

 tion 6,300 feet) proved everywhere unproductive except a small field 

 of tall grass near the Manitou street-car line. Many species were to 

 be found here in numbers. 



Pike's Peak. The' summit of Pike's Peak (elevation 14,147 feet) is 

 a mass of huge boulders with no apparent vegetation. The region 

 about Windy Point (12,000-12,300 feet) is treeless and very steep. A 

 short but sturdy grass grows everywhere that the quantity of huge 

 jagged rocks permit, and in this grass a few species of Orthoptera 

 such as Gomphocerus clavatus, Melanoplus altitudinum, fasciatus and 

 monticola were quite plentiful. 



Along the timber-line (11,578 feet) in the stunted vegetation Orthop- 

 tera were somewhat more varied, but not as interesting as those at 

 Windy Point. At Middle Hudsonian (elevation 10,500 feet) and above 

 the pump station (elevation 10,100 feet) the forest of quaking aspen 

 was exceedingly unproductive and very few specimens were seen. In 

 Dark Canon (elevation 8,900-9,000 feet) in spite of an abundance of 

 grass few Orthoptera could be found, although other forms of insect 

 life were plentiful. On the densely wooded upper slope of Dark Canon 

 work was attended with less success than in the burned-over forest. 



Cripple Creek, Teller Co., elevation 9,591 feet. The few specimens 

 taken at Cripple Creek were from the tailings about the mines. 



Fort Morgan, Morgan Co., elevation 4,338 feet. A rank growth of 

 weeds along the railroad track at this place swarmed with Orthoptera, 

 and in a few minutes a number of interesting forms were taken. 



MANTID^. 



LITANEUTRIA Saussure. 

 Litaneutria minor (Scudder). 



Antlers, Colorado, Aug. 15, 1 immature $ . 



This specimen is referred to this species with some uncertainty, as it 

 may represent L. horealis Bruner, which, however, is of doubtful 

 validity.^ 



This individual was taken on dry soil among dense beds of cactus 

 and sage.

Manitou, Colorado, 6,324 feet, Aug. 16, 3 d', 8 ? ; 6,700 feet, Aug. 

 23,' 1 c?, 1 9. 



This species has previously been recorded from localities in northern 

 and north-central Colorado: Fort Collins, Laporte, Steamboat Springs, 

 Poudre river, Platte Canyon and Denver. 



This species was found among the mountain-loving plants in the 

 immediate vicinity of scrub oak bushes. It appeared to be extremelj^ 

 local, for I found it in but one small area, where, however, it was 

 common.

This series exhibits a great range of color variation, extending from 

 the typical blotched form to the uniform one tentatively named 

 unijormis by Bruner.^ The latter does not appear worthy of recogni- 

 tion, as the extremes and intermediates are present in both the larger 

 series examined. 



This species was quite scarce on the hillsides about the iMammoth Hot 

 Springs, being found among sage and mountain plants. On the prairie 

 outside of Colorado Springs the species was extremely plentiful and

 tion by a male from Nebraska and a 

 female from Livermore, Larimer Co., 

 Colorado, the latter taken July 23, 

 1899. The pattern of coloration is very 

 similar to that of Amphitornus, but the 

 longitudinal bars are narrower. In 

 the Akron and Mammoth Hot Springs 

 specimens the postocular regions are 

 distinctly infuscate. The bars on the 

 caudal femora are distinct in all the 

 specimens examined. 



The four specimens of this species 

 taken were captured in three decidedly 

 different locations. At Mammoth Hot

Springs one was taken on the hillside among sage-brush. At Ivnob 

 Hill two were captured on the prairie, while at Akron it was taken in 

 a dry situation near the railroad.

 of the species from Utah. 



This species was found in Wyoming, Utah and Colorado in almost 

 the same numbers. Each specimen seen was captured, if that was in 

 any way possible. The insect was found among the sage on hillsides 

 and also among the grasses of the prairie.

 the first recorded west of the Rockies. 



About Colorado Springs on the prairie this species was to be found 

 in countless numbers. The males are very rapid in their movements, 

 but so common were they that sometimes over a dozen would be taken 

 with one sweep of the net.

 brown and green-marked individuals. The females were generally 

 of the green form, while the males were more of the wholly brown type.

 pratorum as understood by us, on the basis of material from the south-

eastern States and New Jersey, appears to be slenderer with longer 

 wings. However these differential characters are only averages, 

 numerous specimens which cannot otherwise be separated from the 

 usual pratorum type being intermediate in proportions. 



The species was found in short marshy grass growing about a shallow 

 pond in the prairie. Considerable search was required to find the ten 

 specimens captured.

Grand Junction, Colorado, Aug. 15, 1 6^. 



This species has previously been recorded from Grand Junction and

This specimen was taken in short grass near the Grand river, in a 

 locality which had been recently inundated. No other specimens of 

 Orthoptera were seen about this location.

 slenderer caudal limbs. 



This species was doubtfully recorded from Colorado by Cockerell ^ 

 as taken at Willow Creek, Cusack Ranch, Custer County, in September. 



At Mammoth Hot Springs I found this species in a small glade at 

 the top of the foothills. Here in the thick grass growing about a 

 clump of aspen the series listed above was taken with little difficulty.

These specimens vary considerably in size and 

 somewhat in structure, but such variation is par- 

 alleled in Eastern specimens, from which they 

 cannot be separated. 



This species was rather boreal in distribution and was found in 

 numbers in tall marshy grass in a large open pasture on the shore of 

 Yellowstone Lake. It was also found plentiful at Manitou, Colorado, 

 in the same locality as Chloealtis ahdominalis. At Muir, Mammoth 

 Hot Springs and Manitou the species was found in dry locations, 

 all the other localities in which it was found being more or less damp. 

 The stridulations of the males resemble sik-sik-sik-sik swiftly repeated, 

 the sound being neither loud nor sharp.

This species is distinctly boreal and apparently uncommon in 

 collections, the only definite records being from Fort McLeod, southern 

 Alberta, several localities in Idaho, Fort McKinney,. Wyoming, and 

 Estes Park, Colorado. Individuals from all except the Idaho localities 

 have been examined. 



The specimens taken were all found among the more boreal forms of 

 vegetation in the Park. Nowhere was it possible to take a large 

 series of specimens, in spite of the fact that when found individuals 

 were easily captured. The insects move about quite hurriedlj^ on 

 the ground, and when disturbed can also use their wings advantage- 

 ously.

With this series of nearly seventy specimens, and twenty others in 

 the collection of the Academy, we are unable to find any constant 

 character or characters to separate the three so-called American species 

 of this genus. We have attempted to apply the characters given by 

 Bruner^ to distinguish them, but the Windy Point series exhibits 

 enough variation to prove the futility of attempting to recognize 

 several species. The length of the antennje and the angulation of 

 the fastigium vary to a great extent, and the inflation of the cephalic 

 tibiae of the males apparently is as variable as in the European species 

 of the genus. 



I found this species by no means abundant about the Mammoth 

 Hot Springs, but took it in both the highest and lowest locations. On

the hillside above Manitou, Colorado, I found the species in about the 

 same numbers as at the Hot Springs. From Dark Canon to the 

 highest grassy locations on Pike's Peak, however, the species was 

 common in all favorable locations. The insects were found most 

 common in all open grassy spots, especially above the timber-line 

 where short grasses grow everywhere between the scattered boulders. 

 The males are very active and are constantly stridulating — sik-sik-sik- 

 sik — a sound louder but similar to that produced by Stauroderus 

 curtipennis. The females are slow and clumsy in their movements, 

 appearing quite different from the males.

This specimen is somewhat smaller than Kansas and New Mexican

 species was simply "Southern Colorado." 



While sweeping the prairie grass, a single specimen of this species 

 was taken from among the hundreds of more common species. So 

 great was the number of common Orthoptera in this locality that it 

 was impossible to search for the scarcer individuals, but this species 

 was not met with again even though much sweeping was done in the 

 same vicinity.

With this extensive series before me, I am unable to separate Bruner's

 the species of this genus ^ do not appear to be constant, as specimens 

 from the type locality (Garden of the Gods) cannot be separated from 

 others from the supposed range of occidentalis (Salt Lake City, Grand 

 Junction and Antlers), while a sufficient series from any one locality

372 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



contains individuals with the characters supposed to be diagnostic of 

 any of the three forms and numerous others which cannot be placed 

 in one or the other of the three ''species." 



This was one of the most plentiful species encountered. It was 

 found in many of the arid locaUties, but on the prairie it truly swarmed. 

 Each sweep of the net would take a dozen or more specimens in this 

 location, and so great were its numbers that other scarcer specimens, 

 even when seen, would often easily escape in the myriads of this species.

 also taken on the prairie at Colorado Springs, in dry grass and sage 

 at Gray Cliff and in the other localities in hilly sage-brush locations.

Gray Cliff, Sweet Grass Co., Montana, Aug. 4, 1 cd. Garden of the

As stated by Gillette ^^ the females of this species are very similar 

 to the same sex of elliotti, and rather difficult to distinguish. The 

 slenderer caudal femora of femoratum are probably one of the best 

 differential characters. The Montana record is the most northerly 

 for the species. 



The specimen taken in Montana was captm-ed among the dried 

 grasses in prairie land. Had I had more time in this locality I think 

 more specimens could possibly have been taken. In the Garden of 

 the Gods the species was scarce, the only individuals taken being 

 captured in the grass near the western entrance.

 side of Salt Lake Valley. 



This species was scarce in both localities in which 

 it was taken. I found it on dry soil overgrown with 

 sage, and owing to the activity of the individuals not 

 many of even the few seen were taken. The caudal 

 limbs of this species are so loosely attached that they 

 snap off at the least strain and perfect specimens were 

 consequently difficult to seciu'e.

This series presents the variation in the intensity of the overlying 

 blotches of dark brown usual in the species, and which in specimens of 

 a light base color produces a strongly maculate type. The specimens 

 from Upper Geyser Basin all have the sutural margin of the tegmina 

 distinctly and broadly marked with pinkish ochraceous. 



In the Upper Geyser Basin this species was to be found in small 

 numbers in the small grassy spots between the geyser formations and 

 the Firehole river. In the other localities the species was scarce. 

 Its flight is very vigorous and accompanied by a loud clattering.

 with the maculations much reduced and quite feeble; others have the 

 maculations distinct but the lighter shades all the same color as in 

 the other pale individuals. The specimen from geyser formation at 

 Mammoth Hot Springs is coated with the mineral deposit. 



This species was one of the most plentiful of those found in Montana. 

 At Waco the insects fairly swarmed in the dry prairie grass and sage. 

 In this locality the specimens were extremely pale in coloration; 

 exactly the color of the plants on which they were found. I have 

 never seen greater swarms of insects than those of C. pellucida in the 

 sage at the foot of the hills at Mammoth Hot Springs. The species was 

 everywhere in Montana far more plentiful in the low dry locations, but 

 in Colorado I found it only at a considerable elevation in Dark Canon, 

 Pike's Peak. One specimen was found in the Mammoth Hot Springs 

 completely coated by the white formation. In another spring quite 

 a few specimens of this and other species were found dead, killed 

 probably by the fumes.

This species varies considerably in size and greatly in the intensity 

 of the color pattern and the sutural stripe. Individuals from Camas 

 Prairie, Idaho, have been used for comparison. 



About the Mammoth Hot Springs this species was the most plentiful 

 of the larger Orthoptera. It preferred the hillsides to other locations, 

 and, owing to its somewhat lighter form than other species of the genus 

 found in that locality, it proved swift of flight and not always easy to

 small grassy space in the woods. Only one specimen was seen on the 

 grassy prairie at Knob Hill, Colorado Springs, 



LEPRUS Saussure. 

 Leprus interior Bruner. 



Salt Lake City, Utah, Aug. 13, 1 9 . Hillside at Salt Lake City, 

 Aug. 13 and 14, 4 d", 7 9. 



These individuals agree well with a pair received from Prof. Bruner 

 labelled Salt Lake City, and as a series are smaller and more conspicu- 

 ously colored than a pair of L. cyaneus from Nephista, Colorado. The 

 latter have the dark bars on the tegmina subobsolete, the light sutural 

 stripes and a transverse median light bar being the only distinct mark- 

 ings.- In the Salt Lake specimens the bars are distinct and rather 

 regular, comparatively little variation being exhibited. Several of 

 the latter specimens have the blue of the caudal tibiae weaker than in 

 the other individuals. 



This series was only taken after long and careful search. There was 

 but one place on the steepest portion of Ensign Peak where the insect 

 could be found, and although the females were easily captured when 

 found, the males flew vigorously. So steep was the hillside that it was 

 bare of everything but scattered grasses and an occasional sage-bush. 

 When at rest the insects were wonderfully protected by their colora- 

 tion.

 Morgan and La Junta, Colorado, and Sidne}^ Nebraska. 



A somewhat scarce species and one of the wariest insects collected . I 

 found the specimens on the prairie, and would sometimes be obliged 

 to follow one several hundred yards before an opportunity was offered 

 to capture it. The flight of this insect is swift and high and often of 

 considerable length. 



Dissosteira spuroata Saussure. 



Salt Lake City, Utah, Aug. 13 and 14, 13 c?, 5 9 . 



This series exhibits a great amount of variation in the intensity of 

 the color pattern, some individuals being very dull, almost uniform, 

 while others have a strikingly contrasted pattern. As previously 

 remarked by Saussure, this species bears a considerable superficial 

 resemblance to Spharagemon venustum. 



These specimens were all taken in a field of alfalfa stubble. 

 Although in this locality the species was abundant, specimens were 

 not taken with ease owing to their extreme wariness and their sudden 

 zigzag flight. Their coloration was of great protective value, as when 

 at rest it was almost impossible to distinguish them from the dried 

 alfalfa.

 quite scarce.

These specimens are slightly larger than the original measurements 

 given by Scudder, but otherwise fit the description quite well. The 

 species appears to be readily separable from D. haydeni by the slightly 

 longer and distinctly slenderer caudal femora. The pectinate char- 

 acter of the metazonal rugosities is not characteristic of haydeni, as 

 each of the above series contains specimens in that respect not differ- 

 ing from haydeni, but the femora show them to be cupidineum. The 

 Grand Junction specimens as a series are more suffused than the 

 Antlers individuals. 



The previous Colorado records of this species are from "\Aliite river, 

 near the Utah boundary, Montrose, Grand Junction and Palisades. 



The specimens taken at Grand Junction were captured on the re- 

 cently inundated silt along the bank of the Grand river where numer- 

 ous specimens were seen. Those from Antlers were captured on the 

 dry cactus and sage plain.

This large series exhibits the usual amount of variation in macula- 

 tions seen in this species, chiefly in the intensity of those on the head 

 and pronotmn and in the line between the discoidal and anal areas of 

 the tegmina. One female from Knob Hill has the anal area of the 

 tegmina sub-roseate. 



" The authors cannot agree with Prof. Brunei's suppression of the genus 

 Mestobregma {Ent. News, XVI, pp. 259-260) on the grounds that the insect on 

 wliich it was erected was not (Edipoda plattei Thomas, as stated by Scudder, 

 but one later described by Saussure as Psinidia (Trachyrhachis) parda- 

 lina. Granting this to be so, the action of the author, and not his intention, 

 shoiild alone be considered, and as Mestobregma was based on (Edipoda plattei 

 Thomas, regardless of material in hand, it should rest on that specific name. 

 The question of the apphcation of the bird genus Ixoreus Bonaparte is a parallel 

 case, for discussion of which see Sclater, Ibis, 1903, p. 142, the final ruUng on 

 which case by the American Ornithologists' Union (Committee on Nomenclature 

 (vide Auk, XXI, p. 424) being similar to the opinion expressed above.

Of the series here mentioned nine possess red or reddish wings, five 

 yellow wings and one (Colorado Springs, prairie, Aug. 18, 9 ) has the 

 wings orange. The evidence of this material would thus support the 

 view held by Caudell,^^ w^ho regards Psinidia maculosa Saussure as 

 merely the yellow winged form of pardalinus, an opinion entertained 

 as possible by Saussure in the original description, his words being, 

 'Annae prgecedentis varietas?" 



The Waco record is the most northern for true pardalinus, but if 

 maculosa is identical the range is extended as far north as Fort McLeod, 

 Alberta. 



The specimens taken at Waco were captured among the sage-brush 

 where the species appeared extremely plentiful. I also found this 

 species plentiful at Colorado Springs, in the prairie wherever there was 

 a damp depression. The insect is not swift of flight and may be 

 easily taken with a net. 



CONOZOA Saussure. 

 Conozoa sulcifrons (Scudder). 



Grand Junction, Mesa Co., Colorado, Aug. 15, 11 d*, 12 9 . 



Several specimens of this species were submitted to Mr. A, N. 

 Caudell for comparison with material in the U. S. National Museum, 

 and his remarks are quite interesting and worthy of record. In part 

 he writes : ' ' They are not Conozoa wallula ; they are either C sulcifrons 

 or hehrensi .... I can scarcely tell these species apart. Behrensi is 

 supposed to have shorter wings and elytra, have the median carina of 

 the prozona more deeply cut and have the wing-bands wider. I have

382 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



typical specimens of it from California .... these are quite distinct, 

 but a good series before me grades into the sulcifrons form. ' ' Speci- 

 mens of behrensi from San Diego and Claremont, California, appear 

 readily separable from the Grand Junction individuals, but these are 

 probably typical specimens. 



This species has a rather wide distribution, having been recorded 

 from Nogales and the Huachuca mountains, southern Arizona, in 

 addition to the type locality and Grand Junction, Colorado. It would 

 thus appear to be an Upper and Lower Sonoran species. 



I took this species on the bare silt along the banks of the Grand 

 river. In this locality it was plentiful and many specimens could 

 easily have been taken as their flight is short and not vigorous. The 

 coloration of the insects is undoubtedly of great protective value.

Fig. 11. — Trimerotropis bilobata n. SY>. Antlers, Colorado. Lateral \dew of type- 



(X 3.) 



This species is one of a number which might with almost equal 

 propriety be placed in either Conozoa or Trimerotropis, but which we 

 have placed here chiefly because McNeill has considered its allied 

 species as a member of Trimerotropis rather than Conozoa. 



The new form is apparently closely allied to T. rebellis (Saussure) 

 and differs in the absence of a distinct projecting process on the ventro- 

 caudal angle of the pronotum, in the apparently less distinct lateral

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA.

angles of the pronotum, the more distinct Conozoa-Yike tegminal bars 

 and the color of the caudal femora. 



The great elevation of the prozonal section of the median carina of 

 the pronotum immediately separates it from most of the species. No 

 close relationship exists to Conozoa wallula or any of the recently 

 described species of that genus, the whole build being different from 

 that seen in most of the forms of that genus, although C. acuminata 

 approaches it very closely in this respect. 



Size small; form compressed, slender and elongate; surface finely 

 punctate. Head with the occiput considerably elevated, domed; 

 vertex but slightly lower than the summit of the eyes; fastigium 

 strongly declivent, rather broad in both sexes, greatest width very 

 slightly more than the length, lateral margins distinct and very dis- 

 tinctly converging cephalad, passing into the carinse of the frontal 

 costa without interruption, median carina of the fastigium precurrent, 

 less distinct than the lateral margins of the same; frontal costa rather 

 regularly but not strongly expanding ventrad, the margins sub- 

 parallel for a short distance around the median ocellus, median sections 

 distinct sulcate, less so dorsad, the marginal carinse reaching the 

 clypeal margin ; antennse slightly less 

 than twice the length of the head 

 and pronotum, slightly depressed; 

 eye subovoid, moderately promi- 

 nent particularly in the male, slightly 

 greater than (male) or equal to 

 (female) the length of the infra- 

 ocular sulcus. Pronotum rather 

 narrow; cephalic margin of the dor- 

 sum very obtuse-angulate, caudal 



margin very slightly obtuse-angulate; median carinae cristate on the 

 prozona and strongly divided into two lobes by the first sulcus, the 

 incision being V-shaped and quite broad in the male and very narrow 

 in the female, the cephalic lobe is subtrigonal in the male and lower 

 and more longitudinally rounded in the female, second lobe equal to 

 the first lobe in height and rounded dorsad in both sexes; carina of the 

 metazona subcristate in both sexes; prozona about two-thirds the 

 length of the metazona; lateral angles of the disk very distinct, and 

 slightly carinate on the cephalic section of the metazona; lateral lobes 

 slightly deeper than long, the ventro-caudal angle rounded w'lih. a very 

 slight indication of a ventral blunt protuberance. 



Tegmina elongate, narrow, subequal in width, the costal dilation

384 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



slight and rounded; apex slightly recurved dorsad, rovuided obliquely 

 truncate; intercalary vein distinct, about intermediate in position 

 except dorsad where it regularly approaches and joins the median 

 vein. Wings long and narrow, the width being contained twice in 

 the length ; costal margin evenly and verj^ gently arcuate in the distal 

 half; apex very narrowly rounded; axillary field arcuate apically. 

 Caudal femora quite slender, gently tapering, the width contained 

 about three and a half times in the length, pregenicular constriction 

 not great, pagina rather flat, the sculpturing regular and quite distinct ; 

 caudal tibiae with nine spines on the external margins. 



General colors ecru drab overlaid with bistre in the male, the lighter 

 color on the head and pronotum hoary white. Head with the facial 

 and costal carinas maculate with blackish brown, a large maculation 

 beneath the base of each antenna and the ventral section of the eye 

 marked with the same color in the male, the ventro-caudal section 

 of the gense being washed with the same tint and a postocular stripe 

 indicated, while the fastigium is marked with pale cinnamon-rufous 

 and a pair of arcuate diverging bars of the same color are present on 

 occiput as well as a blackish interocular bar on the vertex; antennse 

 rather broadly annulate with the two general colors. Female with 

 the head finely sprinkled with blackish spots with a trace of a light 

 postocular bar. Pronotum of the male with a median bistre area 

 which narrows caudad and the lateral lobes of prozona are strongly 

 washed with bistre, forming a contrast Avith the hoary metazona. Pro- 

 notum of the female marked much as in the male, but the whole darker 

 and without light colors, while the lateral angles of the disk and a 

 distinct oblique bar on the lateral lobes of the prozona are darker than 

 any of the other pronotal markings. Tegmina with two complete trans- 

 verse bars, one median, one at the proximal fourth and an incomplete 

 bar just distad of the median transverse one, which is broader mesad 

 than at the costal and sutural margins, the bar at the basal fourth 

 toward the sutural margin approaching the median bar and also 

 extending proximad in the intercalarj^ region; distal third with small 

 irregular maculations which are chiefly along the veins. Wings with 

 the transverse bar bistre and situated in the middle, ciuite narrow as 

 the width is not quite a third and a little more than a fourth of the 

 width of the wing, caudad the band arches very slightly proximad 

 and only slightly suffuses the caudal margin, the stigma broad and 

 heavy and extending about half way to the base ; distal section hyaline 

 with the longitudinal veins broadly suffused with bistre toward the 

 apex; proximal half primrose yellow. Cephalic and median limbs

ecru drab distinctly annulate with bistre. Caudal femora ecru drab 

 with three distinct very dark bars and a solidly colored genicular 

 region, the bars being paler laterad than dorsad, the pregenicular 

 annulus ochraceous bujff; caudal tibise rather dull citron yellow touched 

 with spots of fuscous and with the genicular sections bistre and the 

 tips of the spines blackish.

Length of tegmen 18.2 " 26 " 



Length of caudal femur. 9.2 " 12.5 " 



A series of one male and two female paratypic specimens have been 

 examined in addition to the types. The paratypic male has the 

 markings slightly more subdued than in the male type. One of the 

 female specimens is marked as in the male type with strongly con- 

 trasted colors, except that the tegmina have the bars somewhat 

 obsolete and the anal area with the veins more strongly lined with 

 dark. The remaining female specimen is colored much the same as 

 the type, except that the bars of the tegmina are slightl}' less con- 

 spicuous. 



The female type is slightly larger than the paratypic individuals of 

 the same sex, while the additional male is slightly larger than the 

 type. 



This species was found in the arid valley of the Grand river near 

 Antlers station, where the only vegetation was a heavy growth of low 

 cactus interspersed with occasional sage. Specimens were by no 

 means uncommon and could have been easily taken in numbers had 

 the cactus not interfered so much with collecting, as when alarmed 

 the individuals would invariably seek refuge in the dense beds of 

 cactus. Orthoptera were not present in great numbers at this locality 

 but the few species represented were quite interesting. The species 

 yEoloplus chenopodii was the most abundant and most striking. 

 Trimerotropis gracilis (Thomas). 



Antlers, Garfield Co., Colorado, Aug. 15, 3 9 . 



This very distinct species has been recorded from localities ranging 

 from central Idaho to Salt Lake Valley and Colorado. Thomas has 

 recorded it also from the northern boundary (49th parallel) of Mon- 

 tana and Dakota, and Scudder includes Nebraska in its range. Caudell 

 has definitely recorded this species from Durango, Colorado, and Gillette 

 credits it to nineteen localities in the same State, the most eastern 




386 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



of which are Greeley and Pueblo, the majority being west of the 

 divide. 



This species was found among the cactus and sage in the dry bottom 

 lands of the Grand river valley. The insects were by no means 

 plentiful and were also extremely shy, 



Trimerotropis cincta (Thomas). 



Manitou, Colorado, 6,700-7,000 feet, Aug. 23, 11 6", 4 ? . 



The above series shows considerable variation in the strength of the 

 median carina of the fastigium, some individuals having it strongly 

 marked and in others it is hardly perceptible. The color of the caudal 

 tibiae is quite variable in this species, as already noticed by McNeill, 

 and the series in hand exhibits the following : ten with the distal three- 

 fourths of the caudal tibise greenish yellow, four with the same bluish 

 green, and one red. 



According to Gillette this species is found in the mountains and foot- 

 hills of Colorado at altitudes ranging between 6,000 and 10,000 feet, 

 and on both slopes of the divide. In his series of ninety-five speci- 

 mens the hind tibise were without exception bluish or yellowish on 

 the distal portion. The species has been recorded from Nebraska, in 

 addition to New Mexico and Colorado. The collection of the Academy 

 contains specimens from Salida, Manitou Park and Fort Collins (Horse- 

 tooth Mountain), Colorado. 



This species was plentiful on a path among stunted pines on the 

 upper slopes of the foothills back of Manitou. The location would 

 have made it particular^ difficult to capture specimens had not the 

 individuals apparently trusted to their protective coloration. A close 

 approach was necessary to cause them to take wing.

 tana, Aug. 4, 3 c?, 2 9 . Spire Rock, Montana, Aug. 12, 1 cJ' ("on 

 bare mountain") . Upper Geyser Basin, Yellowstone Park, Aug. 7, 4 d' . 



The specimen from Spire Rock is assigned to this species with con- 

 siderable doubt, as it is larger and has a rather different facies, but 

 does not appear to be any closely allied form. The males from Upper 

 Geyser Basin appear rather different from the Daileys and Sphinx 

 specimens, being a little smaller and more like the Spire Rock individual 

 in their somewhat more robust form, though considerably smaller size. 

 This species is probably little more than a form of bifasciata, and hardly 

 worthy of a name in view of the great amount of individual variation 

 found in most of the species of the genus.

These specimens agree quite well with Nebraska, Colorado and 

 Wyoming specimens in the collection of the Academy. The specimens 

 examined present considerable variation in the length of the tegmina. 



This appears to be the first record of the species north of Colorado, 

 except Tie-Siding, Wyoming, from which locality Gillette has recorded 

 it. 



These specimens were taken in the more hilly portions about the 

 Mammoth Hot Springs, where, on account of the character of the 

 country, they were captured with difficulty. The individuals fly 

 swiftly and for long distances when alarmed. 



Trimerotropis praeolara McNeill. 



Grand Junction, Mesa Co., Colorado, Aug. 15, 5 cJ*, 1 9 . 



This species has the fuscous band of the wing very broad, slightly 

 more than one-third the length of the same, and well continued around 

 on the caudal margin, while the spur is almost absent, the disk very 

 pale greenish yellow, and the apex hyaline except for the infuscation 

 of some of the veins. 



The fight base color is almost bone white in some specimens, and 

 distinctly washed with rufous in others. 



This species is known only from Salt Lake, Utah, and Sidney, Ne- 

 braska, in addition to the locality here given. 



Among the bushes growing in the silt deposit along the banks of the 

 Grand river these specimens were secured. The species was by no 

 means as plentiful as T. montana, which was found in the same locality. 



Trimerotropis laticincta Saussure. 



Colorado Springs, Colorado, Aug. 17, 6 o^ , 5 ? . Knob Hifi, Colorado 

 Springs, Aug. 18-22, 7 d", 4 9 . 



This series exhibits considerable variation in the intensity of the 

 bands of the tegmina, and in the shade of the light basic color. In 

 some the latter is decidedly reddish, in others pale yefiowish, and in 

 the majority dull ochraceous. The caudal tibiae are more orange in 

 some specimens than in others, and the pronotum varies from dull 

 ferruginous through warm browns to dull olive, and in one specimen dull 

 blackish-brown. 



As far as can be determined from the material in hand Scudder's 




388 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



T. latifasciata from Utah is the same as this, and his name would have 

 precedence. However, as no Utah material is available I prefer to 

 use Saussiire's name, provisionally at least, for specimens from eastern 

 Colorado. 



The evidence given by Cockerell ^^ regarding the difference in color 

 characters of individuals of this species taken in coitu is especially 

 interesting in view of the value which has been attached to the char- 

 acters there mentioned, i.e., bands on the inner face of the caudal 

 femora, and the width and curve of the wing band. Not much lati- 

 tude is needed in these characters to connect forms like laticincta and 

 latifasciata and melanoptera. Gillette does not consider latifasciata 

 and laticincta separable from T. citrina.^* 



This species has been recorded from Fort Collins, Montrose, Grand 

 Junction, Denver, Baileys and Golden, Colorado, by Caudell. 



One of the more common of the larger prairie land species. The 

 flight of this insect was less vigorous than is usual in species of the 

 genus.

Two of these specimens agree well in the color of the tegmina with a 

 topotypic (Silver City) male, while three have the bars more prominent 

 and contrasting with the lighter base color. The metazona of the 

 pronotum is paler than the prozona in these three specimens, and in 

 two of them the contrast is as great as in T. monticola. The black 

 areas of the wings appear to be slightly less extensive than the 

 specimens described by McNeill. The senior author's T. snowi ^^ may 

 prove to be but a form of this with a less extensive black area on the 

 wings. From the material then in hand it appeared well worthy of 

 separation, but the additional material shows variability which 

 weakens its status. 



This species was scarce even on the prairie land which appeared to 

 be its favorite habitat. In habits it much resembled T. laticincta.

should be considered nothing more than a race of it. The bars of the 

 tegniina are usually somewhat narrower and the caudal tibiae not quite 

 so deep in color. The majority of the specimens have a more or less 

 distinct ferruginous or ochraceous wash suffusing the tegmina, while 

 several have the lighter sections without the same, and clear bone white 

 in color as in the pair of californica used for comparison. A pair of 

 specimens from Salt Lake Valley, received from Prof. Bruner, and 

 labelled by him T. prceclara, belong to this species. Some of the 

 specimens examined have the tegminal bars more distinct and less 

 broken into spots than others, while the width also varies as much as 

 the intensity. A female individual of this species from Salt Lake 

 City, in the collection of the Academy/^ has the tegminal bars much 

 broken into annuli. 



In nine of the specimens examined a second median bar on the lateral 

 face of the caudal femora is more or less distinctly indicated, while 

 in six it is absent or represented only by a very faint clouding. 



This beautiful species was quite common in the arid sage-brush 

 region on the outskirts of Salt Lake City and the series was taken with 

 ease. In spite of the insect's bold coloring it was most inconspicuous 

 when at rest. 



Trimerotropis montana McNeill. 



Grand Junction, Mesa Co., Colorado, Aug. 15, 10 6^, 4 9 . 



This species, if such it might be called, is very closely allied to the 

 preceding, as has been stated by McNeill." As far as the material 

 in hand goes it appears to be only a more subdued form, with the dark 

 tegminal bars broader and pale areas more ochraceous and in a measure 

 lacking the strong contrast seen in strenua. The character of the 

 median carina of the fastigium and the proportions of the pronotum 

 do not differ from the series of strenua, while the lateral face of the 

 caudal femora in the greater majority have a median band more or 

 less faintly indicated in addition to the constant subapical one. 



This species has been previously recorded from Durango and Delta, 

 Colorado, in addition to Grand Junction, as well as Boise City, Idaho^ 

 the type locality. 



These insects were taken on the banks of the Grand river, on ground 

 that had been recently inundated. The soil was sandy and clusters of 

 tall bushes grew here and there. The specimens were active and not 

 taken without difficulty.

Trimerotropis salina McNeill. 



Colorado Springs, Colorado, Aug. 17, 1 cJ*. Knob Hill, Colorado 

 Springs, Aug. 17, 3 ? . 



These specimens are slightly larger than the measurements given by 

 McNeill, but we have placed them here chiefly on account of the poorly 

 contrasted tegminal bars and the broad wing band. The lateral face 

 of the caudal femora presents a median bar of varying intensity in 

 several specimens. The coloration {i.e., blackish bars and suffusion) 

 of the ventral sulcus of the caudal femora appears to be too variable 

 to be given the prominence assigned to it by McNeill. The male 

 individual here studied would be placed in another section of the 

 vinculata group on the femoral coloration, while it unquestionably is 

 the same as the three females which have the coloration as described 

 by McNeill. Instances such as this are by no means confined to this 

 species, but can be found in most any large series of a species of the 

 genus.

 Emerald Spring, Yellowstone Park, Aug. 7, 1 9 . Yellowstone Lake, 

 Yellowstone Park, Aug. 7 and 10, 1 d^ , 1 9 . 



This series is assigned to this species with some little doubt. Some 

 affinity exists with T. inconspicua Bruner, at least as far as published 

 diagnostic characters are concerned. The coloration of the ventral 

 sulcus of the caudal femora varies in individuals from the same locality 

 and not separable by any other character. Some present a solid 

 blackish sulcus with a distinct light pregenicular annulus, others have 

 a well-marked additional light median bar, and a number of specimens 

 have the black interrupted on the sides of the sulcus but undivided in 

 the middle. The evidence of this series of forty-three specimens of 

 unquestionably but one species is that the coloration of the sulcus 

 of the caudal femora is of little or no diagnostic importance. The 

 coloration of the lateral and internal faces of the caudal femora are 

 also unstable, in the authors' opinion, while the intensity of the tegminal 

 bars and the width of the wing bars are by no means as stable as would 

 be supposed from the importance given them as diagnostic characters. 



The series studied presents some variation in size, the males from 

 Fountain being somewhat larger than males from Daileys (length 

 including tegmina: Fountain 28.5 mm., Daileys 25), while the Mud 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 391 



Volcano and Upper Geyser Basin males are slightly smaller than 

 the Daileys specimens (24 mm.). The females appear to be rather 

 uniform in size. Three of the four females from Upper Geyser Basin 

 are suffused with rufescent, while the other female and three males 

 from the same locality are without any suffusion. The females from 

 Fountain have the colors more contrasted than the majority of the 

 Daileys females, while the Emerald Spring female has the contrast 

 just as great. The males from Fountain have the pale tints more 

 grayish and less ochraceous than in the Daileys males. 



The species was so abundant about Daileys that during the iDrief 

 stop of the train nineteen specimens were easily taken. This was also 

 the most abundant species of Orthoptera found about the geyser for- 

 mations of the Park. The insects are wary and rise on the wing with 

 speed. The coloration of the individuals almost invariably blended 

 exactly with the soil on which they were found.

 Aug. 19, 2 9 . 



This series represents a great and interesting amount of variation 

 even for this plastic species, ^'ariation in size is considerable, the 

 largest males being from Electric, Debeque and Manitou, the smallest 

 from Antlers ; the largest female from Salt Lake City, the smallest from 

 Austin Bluffs. These differences in size appear to be individual, 

 as the smallest male (Antlers) is from the same general region as the 

 largest (Debeque). The specimens from Muir and Wliitehall, ]\Ion- 

 tana, are large, of rather uniform size, and but little smaller than the 

 large Salt Lake City individual. 



In coloration we find such variation that a detailed account may be 

 of interest. The Electric specimen has the bands solid and the lighter 

 colors hoary and sharply contrasted; the Muir and Whitehall repre- 

 sentatives are quite dull, the Muir specimen almost blackish, while the 

 bands are only moderately distinct, in one of the Whitehall individuals 

 broken up into annuli. The Muir and Whitehall type has the pro- 

 notum with little contrast, and the caudal femora less variegated than 

 in the Electric individual. The Yellowstone specimen is overcast with 




392 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



dull hoary, the bands very weak, narrow and broken into annuli, the 

 whole insect being much duller and more inconspicuous than the usual 

 type. The Salt Lake City female has the bands of about average 

 width, but weak and rather broken. Antlers and Debeque specimens 

 are of the type which might be called normal or typical, with the bands 

 distinct, broad and solid, and the lateral lobes of the pronotum moder- 

 ately variegated. Austin Bluffs specimens are overcast with reddish 

 ochraceous, one with the bands more distinct and solid than the other; 

 Manitou individuals overcast with dull red, the bands variable in 

 intensity and solidity, but not in width, one specimen having the bands 

 quite blackish. The Garden of the Gods specimens are particularly 

 interesting, being entirely washed with brick red, the tegminal bands 

 distinct but narrower than usual. 



The Garden of the Gods specimens are very interesting as the suffus- 

 ing tint is the predominating color of that region, and in line with this 

 one would expect a uniform very pale type from strongly alkaline 

 regions, which does not hold true of the large amount of material of 

 this species seen. Series from San Diego, California, one of the original 

 localities; Alamogorclo, New Mexico, and Quartzsite, Arizona, are 

 extremely variable among themselves, and each exhibit extremes as 

 different, or nearly so, as those in the material here treated. How- 

 ever, no specimens quite as reddish as the Garden of the Gods individual 

 have been seen from other localities. The band of the wing is quite 

 narrow and weak in some of the Manitou specimens,^* and heavy in 

 Whitehall and Muir individuals. 



The species was generally distributed and equally abundant in the 

 localities in which it was collected. The specimens taken about the 

 Garden of the Gods showed remarkable protective coloration, as all 

 were overcast with brick red which blended exactly with the character- 

 istic brick red formation of the Garden. This was the only species 

 found on these outer oppings.

Salt Lake City, Utah, Aug. 13, 2 d', 1 9. Top of Ensign Peak, 

 Salt Lake City, Utah, Aug. 13, 1 d", 2 9 . 



These specimens of this beautiful species have the tegminal bars 

 uniform in pattern and varying but slightly in intensity, except in the 

 female from Salt I^ake City in which they are quite dark. The colora- 

 tion of the ventral sulcus of the caudal femora varies from black with 

 two light bars in the distal half to but one bar in the region, while in 



'* These may possibly represent one of the other species of the vinculata group -

several specimens the evanescent bar (proximal) is present but incom- 

 plete. The coloration of the caudal tibiae varies from the usual light 

 tint to a dark glaucous blue. The size of the specimens is quite 

 uniform. 



This species has been recorded from Washington (Yakima), Oregon, 

 (Umatilla), Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah and Los Angeles, 

 California. 



This species was found in the same locations as T. cyaneipennis, 

 Avhich species it much resembled in habits. 

 Trimerotropis cyaneipennis Bruner. 



Salt Lake City, Utah, Aug. 13, 4 d", 4 9 . Foothills, Salt Lake City, 

 Utah, Aug. 14, 3 ^^,2 ?. 



This series is quite uniform in size, while variation in coloration is 

 chiefly due to the intensity of the broken tegminal bars, though one 

 specimen from Salt Lake City is uniforml}^ very pale with most of the 

 markings almost obsolete. 



This species has been recorded from the Salt Ijake Valley region, 

 and from Grand Canon, Flagstaff and Prescott, Ai-izona. The two 

 males recorded from Prescott are very considerably darker than any 

 of the Salt Lake A' alley specimens examined. 



This species was somewhat common but inhabited the most inacces- 

 sible portions of Ensign Peak, and owing to the rapidity of its flight 

 specimens were taken Avith no little trouble.

Allied to C. undulatus (Thomas) and shastanus Bruner, but differing 

 from the former in the more robust form, the broader head, broader 

 heavier and less strongly sulcate frontal costa, larger eyes, slightly less 

 angulate caudal margin of the pronotum and in details of the coloration, 

 as the lighter and usually more variegated tegmina and pronotum and 

 the less distinct fuscous band and spur of the wing. From shastanus 

 it appears to differ in the heavier form and the structure of the first 

 subjacent radial vein. 



The form of the wing of this species is essentially that of C. undulatus, 

 and its closest relationship appears to be with that species. As 

 shastanus is not available for study, comparison can only be made with 

 descriptions, but the results of such comparisons seem sufficient to 

 separate the specimens in hand, especially when we consider the 

 peculiar structure of the first subjacent radial in the older species, 

 while in the new one here treated the structure of that region does not 

 differ materially from the type seen in undulatus. 



In coloration a number of specimens of this species bear a striking 

 superficial resemblance to C. carlinianus. 



Size medium; form quite robust; surface finely rugulose. Head 

 with the occiput gently but distinctly arched, the interocular region 

 no more elevated than the summits of the eyes and in width but little 

 less than the length of the eye; fastigium slightly declivent, forming 

 an obtuse angle with the face, nearly as wide as long, shallow, with the 

 median carina rather faint and the marginal carinse but little more 

 distinct; frontal costa broad, expanded between the antennae and 

 moderately constricted immediately ventrad of the ocellus, margins 

 carinate and nearly (c^) or not (?) reaching the clypeal margin, 

 broadly sulcate ventrad of the ocellus particularly in the male, strongly 

 punctate dorsad with a depressed area at the junction with the fasti- 

 gium; eyes moderately prominent, rather small, very broad ovoid in 

 shape; antennae slightly longer than the head and pronotum together, 

 somewhat depressed in the proximal section. Pronotum deplanate 

 dorsad, broad, distinctly expanded caudad; cephalic margin very 

 broadly and obtusely angulate; caudal margin rectangulate in the 

 male, obtuse-angulate in the female, the angle finely formed and little 

 rounded in either sex; lateral angles rounded and hardly marked on 

 the prozona, distinct and heavy shoulders present on the metazona; 

 median carina fine, little elevated, depressed at the principal sulcus, 

 prozona about half the length of the metazona; lateral lobes slightly

deeper than long, considerably impressed mesad, ventro-caudal angle 

 rounded. Tegmina rather broad, the greatest width contained 

 slightly more than four times in the length ; costal lobe very slight and 

 low, sutiu-al margin straight, apex obliquely truncate toward the 

 sutural margin, the distal third of the costal margin arcuate, making 

 the immediate apex rounded rectangulate; intercalary vein distinct, 

 intermediate in position proximad, close to the median vein distad. 

 Wings moderately falcate, broad, the breadth being contained about 

 once and a half in the length; humeral field with the apex rounded 

 acute-angulate ; axillary field with the margin very slightly arcuate 

 and not lobate, being no more prominent than the next area in the 

 radiate field ; posterior axillary vein with its ramus paralleling closely 

 the anterior axillary vein for a considerable distance, but not coalescing 

 with it; radiate veins moderately thickened. Caudal femora rather 

 slender, the ventral carina distinctly but slightly produced arcuate; 

 caudal tibiae with nine spines on the lateral margins. 



General color ecru drab, sprinkled, spotted and blotched with drab; 

 eyes burnt umber; antennse of the paler color annulate with bistre; 

 dorsum of the pronotum and the lateral lobes marked with the darker 

 color. Tegmina with traces of three bands of quadrate and ocellate 

 spots, these spots being almost wholly formed by the infuscation 

 veins and cross veins, the bands being proximad, proximo-mesad and 

 disto-mesad, while the distal third is supplied with scattered quadrate 

 ocelli of the darker color. Wings with the transverse band very weak 

 and almost severed, being chiefly an infuscation of veins and without 

 definite limits, extending caudo-mesad and with a broad, moderately 

 distinct stigma which extends half way to the base, the color of the band 

 and stigma being drab ; distal portion hyaline except for inf uscate veins, 

 proximal portion citron yellow. Cephalic and median limbs of the 

 general colors annulate ; caudal femora with a pale pregenicular annulus, 

 and with traces of two transverse bars which are more distinct dorsad ; 

 caudal tibiae pale, infuscate proximad and distad, the spines touched 

 apically with blackish.

 characters appear to agree well

 plentiful about the Hot Springs 

 and much time was occupied in collecting the ten specimens. The insects 

 are most swift and shy, so that great difficulty was experienced in

approaching them close enough to strike with the net. They may be 

 heard high in the air making for several minutes at a time a noise like 

 the whirring of machinery. The sound is continuous while the insects 

 rise and fall in a most peculiar erratic flight. I have seen specimens of 

 this species fly for over a quarter of a mile making continually this 

 peculiar sound. Of all the Orthoptera met with this was without 

 doubt the most vigorous and elusive species.

These specimens do not differ in size, the female, however, being 

 slightly more robust. The frontal costa in the male is quite broad and 

 similar to the female, thus differing from a large number of Eastern 

 specimens examined. A series of thirty-one specimens, covering 

 localities extending from the mountain regions of Pennsylvania and 

 Maine west to the northern peninsula of Michigan (Pequaming), shows 

 that while considerable variation in color and size is present in a series, 

 it cannot well be correlated with locality. The two Montana specimens 

 are among the largest seen.

These specimens exhibit considerable variation in the intensity and

 as in the males. The males are quite uniform in the coloration of the 

 tegmina, both in width of bars and intensity. 



This species was quite common on the prairie. The flight is slow

This series of thirty specimens clearly shows that the species has two 

 color phases and that the green phase should not be confused with 

 Charpentier's B. virescens, a Mexican species of a quite distinct char- 

 acter, as an examination of his plate will show. Of the series examined 

 eight are of the brown phase and twenty-one of the green, while one 

 is too discolored to determine its true color. The green specimens 

 vary considerably in the shade of the green, but the males appear to 

 have the richer coloration. 



There is considerable variation in the size of the males. 



The following color description is made from a female specimen in 

 the green phase from Colorado Springs received alive in Philadelphia 

 and carefully stuffed after death, to-day presenting the same coloration 

 as in life. 



Predominating color oil green. Head dark oil green above becoming 

 paler ventrad on the face and gense, the caudal margin of the gense, 

 the mandibles and broad band extending from cephalad of the eye 

 ventrad to the clypeal sulcus and the lateral portions of the clypeus 

 pale flesh color; eyes clay color sprinkled with bistre; antennae dusky, 

 margined laterad in the proximal section with pale greenish. Pro- 

 notum with the lateral and median carinse marked with very dark 

 French green, on the metazona extending slightly ventrad and some- 

 what suffusing the lateral lobes; lateral carinse bordered mesad by a 

 line of pinkish vinaceous; recurved caudal and lateral lobe margins 

 chiefly flesh color. Tegmina tawny ochraceous with fair-sized bistre 

 spots well distributed over them. Abdomen suffused with bistre 

 dorsad ; a pair of rather broad distinct longitudinal lines, one on each 

 side of the median carina, and a transverse series of spots on the caudal

margin of each segment, vinaceoiis. Venter bone white. Cephalic 

 and median hmbs bone white washed with greenish. Caudal femora 

 oil green dorsad, whitish ventrad, the ventro-lateral sulcus with 

 quadrate touches of vinaceous-ruf ous, while the internal face is suffused 

 with the same color, a median line of French green is present on the 

 lateral face and one of brick red on the internal face, genicular region 

 bluish green dorsad, with a proximal transverse blackish bar ventrad, 

 the arches chestnut; caudal tibise lavender laterad, vinaceous internally, 

 the genicular region bluish, the spines bone white tipped with black. 



This species was by no means abundant, but in the prairie region 

 specimens would every now and then be found. The insects were so 

 awkward that they seemed to have almost no control over their move- 

 ments. Their coloration, however, undoubtedly proves a great pro- 

 tection to them.

As far as can be determined from the material" in hand, including 

 specimens determined by Bruner as both wyomingensis and cylindricus, 

 and the literature bearing on the subject, no reason is apparent for 

 separating the two above-mentioned forms. Bruner's cylindricus was 

 based on the brown phase, while in addition to the coloration larger 

 size was given as a differential character. This latter would appear to 

 be purely an individual matter, as green specimens have been examined 

 nearly as large as Bruner's measurements of that sex in cylindricus. 

 All the Roggen males are in the brown phase, and the single female in 

 the green. 



Material has also been examined from Valentine and Haigler, 

 Nebraska, and Denver and Greeley, Colorado.

This series as a whole has shorter wings than nine individuals from 

 southern Aiizona, and in consequence of this the specimens appear 

 somewhat more robust. The variation in size in the females is con- 

 siderable, the larger type greatly predominating, while the males 

 vary appreciably. The coloration tends in some specimens toward 

 brownish and in a few is distinctly brown. This is also true of a male 

 Salt Lake City specimen -^ which has been in the Academy collection 

 quite a time. 



This species was by far the most plentiful of the genus Hesperotettix 

 which I found, and individuals were quite coimnon in the sage growing 

 from the foot to the top of Ensign Peak. Individuals of the species 

 were very active, but relied chiefly for protection on their jumping 

 ability, which was very considerable.

Antlers, Garfield Co., Colorado, Aug. 15, 11 d^, 14 9 . 



This series varies considerably in the intensity of the coloration, 

 some individuals being more ashy than others. 



The specimens were easily taken in spite of the cactus, in which they 

 invariably sought refuge, for their movements were slow and they could 

 jump but a short distance. The species was abundant.

Although much time was spent searching carefully for specimens of 

 this species, two days' collecting resulted in but four specimens being 

 found. All were taken on the gravelly tops of the foothills where 

 vegetation was almost absent. Their color blended perfectly with the 

 soil and they appeared to rety on this as a means of protection.

Closely allied to P. ascensor Scudder from American Fork Canon, 

 Utah, agreeing almost perfectly in the form of the abdominal append- 

 ages and other characters, but differing in the vertex being somewhat 

 elevated, the interspace between the eyes in the male over twice as 

 broad as the first antennal joint, the frontal costa more sulcate, the 

 size slightly larger, the antennse reddish and the caudal tibiae differently 

 colored. 



Size medium (for the genus). Head with the occiput rounded and 

 distinctly elevated above the pronotum in the c?, hardly elevated in 

 the ? ; fastigium moderately declivent, very shallowly and broadly 

 excavated, interspace between the eyes in both sexes over twice as 

 wide as the proximal joint of the antennae; frontal costa broad, hardly 

 (c?) or very slightly (?) narrower than the interspace between the 

 eyes, slightly depressed around the ocellus, not sulcate, biseriate 

 punctate dorsad ; antennae rather short, defective in the c? , distinctly 

 but not considerably longer than the pronotum in the 9 ; eyes hardly 

 prominent, truncate cephalad, distinctly longer than the infraocular 

 sulcus. Pronotum very slightly inflated, very slightly tectate, meta- 

 zona finely punctate; cephalic margin subtruncate, caudal margin very 

 slightly arcuate, no distinct lateral carinae but shoulder angles moder- 

 ately prominent caudad; prozona slightly longer than the metazona 

 in both sexes, quadrate in the c?, slightly transverse in the 9 , principal 

 transverse sulcus very well marked, median carina more distinct on 

 the metazona than cephalad, but not markedly elevated anywhere

 slightly less than the pronotum in length, sublanceolate, twice as long 

 as broad in the c^ , half again as long as broad in the ? , apex narrowly 

 rounded, tegmina well separated dorsad. Abdomen with the apex 

 but little elevated and not at all recurved; furcula about a third the 

 length of the supra-anal plate and distinctly longer than the segment 

 from which they spring, simple, parallel; supra-anal plate produced

These two specimens were taken on the pebbly summit of the foot-

 Podisma oregonensis (Thomas). 



The following localities are represented, all in Yellowstone Park: 



Mammoth Hot Springs, Aug. 5, 4 cJ^, 1 ? . Summit of first foothill

 8 d", 7 ? . Near Grand Caiion, Aug. 10, 10 d", 4 ? . 



The specimens from the higher altitudes, as the Continental Divide 

 and Grand Canon representatives, average smaller than the individuals 

 from lower altitudes. One male from Mammoth Hot Springs is 

 partially covered with geyser deposit and is larger than any repre- 

 sentative of the same sex (d*) seen. In coloration some specimens 

 have the paler markings more brilliant than in others, and some few 

 individuals from Grand Canon are suffused with smoky brown. 



This species appeared to be widely distributed and was found quite 

 plentiful in the short grass of all the elevated open lands in the Park. 

 The species was strictly terrestrial, and individuals were invariably 

 active and possessed of considerable saltatorial power.

Several of the above specimens belong to the richly colored green 

 phase described by Gillette. 



In all the localities in which I collected on the Colorado prairie where 

 the vegetation was high and rank, I found this beautiful species in 

 moderate numbers. The individuals were very active, but could be 

 easily beaten from the weeds in which they had taken refuge. The 

 green form was noticeable for its brilliancy,

 at 10,100 feet, 1 9 at Middle Hudsonian, 10.500 feet. 



The specimens here recorded from Emigrant, Montana, are, as far as 

 known, the most northern definite record except one from Bismarck, 

 North Dakota. The species has been recorded by Gillette from locah- 

 ties up to an altitude of 8,000 feet, and in view of the Pike's Peak 

 records here given it will be seen to extend to an elevation of at least 

 10,500 feet, and to be truly an alpine species. In size these Pike's 

 Peak individuals do not appear appreciably smaller than specimens 

 from the vicinity of Colorado Springs, and are considerably larger than 

 others from Durango, Colorado. 



From the material collected this species appears to frequent a 

 variety of habitats, from a distinctly arid region at Emigrant to a 

 grassy gully in the Garden of the Gods. On the whole this form 

 frequented the more sterile sections of the regions in which it was 

 collected. 

 Melanoplus flabellifer Scudder. 



Knob Hill, Colorado Springs, Colorado, Aug. 18, 2 o' . Garden of 

 the Gods, Manitou, Colorado, Aug. 17, 4 c^. 



These specimens are identical with Scudder's flabellifer in the form 

 of the cerci, but the validity of the species is, in the authors' opinion, 

 questionable. As Gillette has shown ,^5 a large series of specimens 

 will contain forms referable to true occidentalis, flabellifer and cuneatus, 

 and have a number of intermediates between these types as well. A 

 number of the specimens referred in this paper to occidentalis are not 

 typical of it, but were placed there as it is the older species and has 

 priority over flabellifer in case the latter is synonymized. This action 

 appears to us to be inevitable, but the material at hand is not extensive 

 enough to take such action. No specimens of the cuneatus type are in 

 the series. 



The specimens of this species were taken in the same localities as 

 M. occidentalis.

similar in coloration to individuals from eastern Colorado and Nebraska. 

 The coloration is decidedly brown, sometimes gray brownish, and little 

 yellow or clear gray is apparent. The head and pronotum are sprinkled 

 with fine umber dots and the tegmina have distinct quadrate macula- 

 tions. The length of the body ranges from 17.5 to 19.5 millimeters. 



All of the specimens of this species were found in the valley of the 

 Grand river. Those taken at Grand Junction were found on silt 

 near the river, where very little vegetation was to be seen. The 

 insect's coloration was extremely protective and the species relied 

 almost entirely on its wings for locomotory power.

 Prairie land, Colorado Springs, Aug. 18, 4 9 . Garden of the Gods, 

 Manitou, Colorado, Aug. 17 and 19, 1 cJ*, 1 9 . 



This series shows considerable variation in size and color, the latter 

 chiefly in varying intensity of the pattern. 



This species was found in the same situations as M. occidentalis, but 

 in much greater numbers. 

 Melanoplus sanguineus Bruner. 



Garden of the Gods, Colorado, Aug. 17, 1 c?, 1 9 . 



This striking and beautiful species was recently described from 

 Lamar and Las Animas, in the prairie section of the Arkansas valley, 

 Colorado. This record shows it ascends well into the foothills. 



The coloration of the caudal femora and tibiae is very striking and 

 serves to readily identify the species. The female specimen in hand has 

 the head, caudal section of the disk of the pronotum and the dorsal 

 face of the caudal femora somewhat suffused with greenish. 



The specimens were taken in the high grass of a meadow at the 

 western entrance to the Garden of the Gods.

The form of the cerci of the male individuals here placed under this 

 species agree fairly well with Scudder's figure of those parts, and not- 

 withstanding his remarks to the contrary the authors believe inter- 

 medius is at the most not more than a form of atlanis, and probably not 

 even worthy of a name, varietal or otherwise. Numbers of specimens 

 have been examined which seem to connect atlanis and intermedius, 

 and all such are here treated under atlanis; only those closely approxi- 

 mating Scudder's figure being referred provisionally to intermedius. 



Considerable variation in size is noticed, males ranging from 18 to 24 

 millimeters in the length of body. One male has the caudal tibiae 

 pale reddish, all the others varying shades of glaucous.

This series exhibits a very great amount of variation in size and 

 coloration, and in the form of the cerci many of the males placed here 

 approach intermedius, as mentioned in the remarks under that form. 

 The dullest specimens with little contrasted coloration are from the 

 Garden of the Gods, and the palest ones are from the vicinity of Salt 

 Lake City. However, while the majority of specimens of each series 

 from the two above localities are uniformly dark or light, a few speci- 

 mens from each locality are of what might be called the average type. 

 Quite a number of specimens have the caudal tibite of various shades of 

 glaucous. 



A common species in both sage-brush and prairie-grass.

Melanoplus bilituratus (Walker). 



Salt Lake City, Utah, Aug. 13, 1 c? . Top of Ensign Peak, Salt Lake

These specimens are perfectly typical of bilituratus, which is probably 

 only a race of atlanis. This is the first record of this species from Utah, 

 and the first one east of Fort Halleck, Elko Co., Nevada, except one 

 from Weeksville, Missoula Co., Montana.

The capture of these specimens is of considerable interest as it shows 

 that this very destructive species is still present, either as a migrant or 

 as a native, in regions formerly devastated by it. The absence of recent 

 records of this species from Colorado shows it has become a scarce 

 species. The material examined has been compared with individuals 

 from Nebraska and North Dakota. 



Two specimens from the Garden of the Gods were taken in a grassy 

 meadow, while the other specimen was taken in an aspen thicket in 

 sparse grass.

 of the species. Taken as a whole the series examined is c{uite uniform 

 in size, and with such color variation as does exist being chiefly in the 

 lighter or dark shade of the general color. 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 409 



I found this species quite plentiful in a grassy field choked with many 

 bushes. In this locality the species far outnumbered any other 

 Orthopteron. At ]\Ianitou I found it on the hillside, where mountainous

This rather conspicuous species has previously been recorded only 

 from Montana. The males in the series examined are quite uniform in 

 size, and fairly so in coloration. The females vary considerably in 

 size, one from Mammoth Hot Springs being distinctly smaller than the 

 others, which latter are slightly larger than the two females from Norris 

 Pass. The dark colors are more blackish and the browns more rufes- 

 cent in the Norris Pass individuals than in any others.

 below Windy Point, 12,000 feet, Aug. 20, 3 d", 2 9 . 



The Dark Canon specimens are quite uniform in size, but the three 

 Windy Point specimens are smaller than any of the former and the 

 males are smaller than any specimens of the species seen. The smallest 

 Dark Canon male measures 16.2 millimeters in length, while a Windy 

 Point specimen measures 14.5. There is considerable variation in the 

 intensity of color in the series examined, but the pattern does not 

 vary to any considerable degree. The proximal portions of the 

 antennae are more red than orange in all the Pike's Peak specimens. 

 The ventral sulcus of the caudal femora is dull yellowish in some 

 specimens and suffused with sanguineous in others. 



This species was extremely common in grassy Dark Canon, while 

 several specimens were also taken in the short grass above the tree-line. 

 The insects were active but easily captured.

These specimens vary considerably in size, as is usual in this species, 

 particularly in the females. No difference is noted between Pennsyl- 

 vania and New Jersey specimens and those recorded above. All the 

 individuals here studied have the tegmina falling short of the tips of 

 the caudal femora. 



The Windy Point record carries the vertical range of this species a 

 thousand feet higher than previous records. 



This was the only species to be found in the dense pine woods back 

 of Old Faithful Geyser, and it was one of the very few distinctly sylvan 

 species taken. One specimen, however, was captured above -the 

 timber-line on Pike's Peak and one on the prairie outside of Colorado 

 Springs. The insects were extremely powerful and vigorous.

The Colorado series contains individuals which are typical of M. 

 plumbeus as understood by Scudder, but from this extremely bright 

 type any number of intermediates, forming a complete chain and con- 

 necting the dull form of femur-rubrum found in the East, can be selected. 

 From the Knob Hill series alone the extreme plumbeus type and typical 

 femur-rubrum with seven graded intermediates can be selected. The 

 majority of specimens belong to the intermediate forms, the extremes 

 being scarcer, in the studied series, than the annectant forms. 



The authors fully agree with Gillette's remarks ^^ on this species and 

 cannot consider plumbeus as other than brightly colored femur-rubrum. 

 The specimens from Roggen, Colorado, Nebraska and Missouri do not 

 approach plumbeus. The specimens from Montana localities are very

noticeably smaller than the others examined. No short-winged in- 

 dividuals have been seen. 



This species was found in many localities, but nowhere more common 

 than in the prairie grass outside of Colorado Springs. The brilliantly 

 colored specimens (M. plumbeus Dodge) were always found in the 

 damper locations where vegetation was most abundant.

This large series exhibits a considerable amount of variation in 

 color and size, the greater part of Avhich can be attributed to elevation. 

 The specimens from Pike's Peak are all smaller, those from over 11,000 

 feet particularly, and the colors are as a rule duller. Specimens from 

 Windy Point are as small as 15 (d^) and 16 ( 9 ) millimeters in the 

 length of the body, while those from Knob Hill are much larger and 

 range between 17.5 and 22 (d^) and 23 and 30 ( 9 ). One male and one 

 female from Yellowstone Lake as well the majority of the Pike's Peak 

 individuals are very dark in color, while some of the females from the 

 latter locality are strongly touched with green. The specimens from 

 the lower elevations are quite richly colored, and this with then- larger 

 size would seem to indicate another species, but no characters of the 

 appendages seem to warrant their separation. The Middle Hudsonian 

 individuals are perfectly intermediate between the Pike's Peak repre- 

 sentatives and the lowland specimens in size and the brilliancy of the 

 coloration. 



The species has previously been recorded only from Sierra Blanca, 

 Colorado, 12,000 to 13,000 feet, and from Windy Point, Pike's Peak. 



This species was found in exceedingly varied locations. Not only 

 was it abundant in the alpine herbage above the timber-line on Pike's 

 Peak, but it was also plentiful on the prairie outside of Colorado Springs. 

 In the Yellowstone Park the species was found in the decidedly boreal 

 portions.

These specimens agree fully with the description and figures of this 

 species, which has been previously recorded only from northern and 

 w^estern Arizona. There is considerable variation in size, 20 to 24 

 millimeters in the length of body of the & and 24 to 28.5 in the 9 . 

 The color of the caudal tibise varies from pale glaucous to very decided 

 blue, pale laterad, while the general color is more besprinkled with 

 fine spots of umber on the dorsum in some specimens than in others. 



This species was found almost invariably among the sage. The 

 color of the insects blends so exactly with the sage-brush that when 

 at rest they are difficult to find. I noticed that the insects almost 

 always sought refuge in the sage instead of on the ground. On and 

 about Ensign Peak the species was plentiful.

This large series presents a considerable amount of variation in size 

 and color. The smallest d^ measures 17.5 millimeters in the length of 

 body, the largest 22 ; the smallest 9 20, the largest 26. The individuals 

 with the pronotum with a dark median bar superficially much resemble 

 M. packardii. The general coloration is quite dark in some individuals 

 and very light in others, the latter type having all the normal darker 

 markings very weak, while some few specimens have the dorsum of 

 the head and pronotum suffused with purplish red. The Roggen 

 individuals are more grayish than any others examined. Of the large 

 series examined all but two have red caudal tibiae, the color usually 

 pale coral red. The other two specimens, a pair from Knob Hill, 

 have glaucous tibise. The authors are much inclined toward the 

 opinion recently expressed by Gillette,^^ to the effect that M. coccineipes 

 represents merely a red-legged form of M. angustipennis. 



This was one. of the species which made up the vast swarms of 

 Orthoptera everywhere to be found in the prairie grasses outside of 

 Colorado Springs. So great was the number of grasshoppers that it 

 was almost impossible to follow any one interesting specimen when 

 seen. All of the specimens of this species were taken by sweeping the 

 grass.

From the above series it is quite evident that representatives of this 

 species from the general vicinity of Colorado Springs are smaller than 

 specimens from Montana, Yellowstone Park, Utah and eastern 

 Colorado. Males from IMontana, I'tah and the Yellowstone range 

 between 27 and 30 millimeters in length of body, while Knob Hill 

 males measure from 22.5 to 26. The single female from Fort Morgan, 

 however, is as large as the average Utah female. Specimens examined 

 from several Nebraska localities are about the same size as the Knob 

 Hill individuals and smaller than the Fort Morgan representative. 



In coloration the Montana, Utah and Yellowstone individuals are 

 much more strikingly colored than those from Knob Hill, the colors 

 being more contrasted and richer. In a series of six specimens from 

 Boulder and Fort Collins, examined in this connection, several are 

 brightly colored ; one male, the only Boulder specimen, being as striking 

 as Utah individuals. 



In the series listed above seven specimens have wholly glaucous 

 caudal tibiae, while the remainder vary from carmine to pale pinkish, 

 including some solferino and very pale purplish tibiae, while one (Salt 

 Lake City) has partially glaucous, partially solferino and purple tibiae, 

 the glaucous pale and limited to the proximal portion of the lateral 

 faces. 



The specimens of this species taken at Salt Lake City were almost 

 all from the luxuriant weeds growing along ditches and drains. Those 

 from Colorado Springs were captm-ed in the more heavily weed over- 

 grown spots about damp depressions in the prairie. The insects were 

 active, but often clung tenaciously to the weeds in which they hid, and 

 it was consequently easy to capture as man}^ as desired.

ever, only in the replacing of the yellow lighter colors with shades of 

 light brown. In some individuals the caudal tibiae are much more 

 valgate than in others, while the inflation of the ventro-lateral carina 

 and the adjacent parts of the caudal femora is quite marked in the 

 male. A rather striking character of the coloration of this species is 

 the continuation of the internal black vertical genicular bar of the 

 caudal femora on the ventral surface, but not on the external face. A 

 blackish patellar spot is present on the caudal tibise of some specimens 

 and not of others. 



The specimens here studied have been compared with paratypic 

 material. 



This species was one of those which swarmed in the prairie grass. 

 In certain localities where the ground was somewhat damp it occurred 

 in countless numbers.

Mammoth Hot Springs, Yellowstone Park, 6,500 feet, Aug. 5, 1 d^. 



This specimen has been compared with material from the Big Horn

The specimen was taken on the summit of the first hill back of the 

 Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel. The ground in that locality was bare, 

 being but sparsely overgrown with short grasses. At the time, the 

 specimen was not noticed to be a desirable insect, and a search for 

 others was consequently not made.

The brownish marking on the dorsum of the pronotum is rather 

 pale and nearly uniform in color, the lateral bars being extremely 

 weak.

produced by Orchelimum vulgare. When alarmed the insects fairly 

 tumble from their perch and hurriedly seek their holes at the plant's 

 roots. So quickly can these apparently clumsy insects reach their 

 holes that it is only possible to surprise them still in the bush by ap- 

 proaching with the greatest caution. The insects are exceedingly 

 poor at jumping and are completely helpless when removed from their 

 home bush.

Most of these specimens would by the rather uniform dorsal face of 

 their abdomen be referred to pallidipalpus, but the authors do not 

 consider the blackish V-shaped maculations of the abdomen constant 

 enough to use for the separation of the two ' 'forms." 



This species was somewhat plentiful under sage-brush. They 

 inhabited holes at the roots of these bushes, in which they sought 

 refuge upon the least sign of danger. They hopped along awkwardly, 

 but disappeared in their holes with surprising speed.

ON SOME REPTILIAN FREAKS FROM INDIANA. 



BY W. S. BLATCHLEY. 



Cases of deformity or malformation are seemingly much less common 

 among wild forms of life than among mankind or his domestic animals. 

 One often sees or hears of two-headed calves, five-legged pigs and fom-- 

 legged chickens, but "freaks" among wild mammals, birds and reptiles 

 come to notice but seldom. In the literature on herpetology at my 

 command I can find only the following records of malformation among 

 reptiles and batrachians in the United States. 



Dr. Samuel L. Mitchill, in the early part of the nineteenth century, 

 published an article entitled "Facts and considerations showing that 

 the Two-Headed Snakes of North America and other parts of the 

 World are not individuals of a distinct race, but universally Monsters,"^ 

 in which he recorded the finding in Genesee county. New York, of 120 

 of the young of a female black snake, Bascanion constrictor L., among 

 which were "three monsters, one with two distinct heads; one with a 

 double head and only three eyes; and one with a double skull, furnished 

 with three eyes and a single lower jaw; this last had two l)odies." 

 These three specimens he figiu-ed on an accompanying plate. 



Dr. Mitchill noted that records of two-headed snakes had been made 

 up to that date from the "West Indian and Polynesian islands; in 

 Great Britain and in Italy, ' ' and that those from the foreign countries 

 had been supposed to ' ' constitute a race of their own and propagate 

 their kind in regular succession. ' ' His paper, based on the finding in 

 New York of three individuals among one litter, was written to con- 

 trovert this foolish supposition. He added that ' ' serpents are destitute 

 of limbs, and are consequently incapable of monstrosity in feet, legs, 

 hands and arms, either by defect, redundancy or malformation; when 

 it happens, therefore, monstrosity must be in the head or tail, and the 

 head is most frequently the seat of it. " 



Prof. Jeffries Wyman recorded the occurrence in Massachusetts of a 

 specimen of water snake, Tropidonotus sipedon (L.), with two heads 

 and two tails .^ 



1 American Journ. Science and Arts, X, 1826, 48. 



2 Proc. Bost. Soc. Nat. Hist., IX, 183. 




420 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



In the American Naturalist, Vol. XII, 1878, p. 470, Mr. H. C. Yarrow 

 stated that there was ' ' but one two-headed snake in the enormously 

 large collection of reptiles in the Smithsonian Institution. ' ' This was 

 a specimen of Ophibolus getulus (L.), the common chain or king snake, 

 from Port Tobacco, Maryland. 



In the same volume, page 694, Dr. J. S. Kingsley mentioned a two- 

 headed snake, species not given, as being in the collection of Williams 

 College, Massachusetts. 



In his "Report on the Reptiles and Batrachians of Ohio,"^ Dr. W. H. 

 Smith stated that the Museum of Michigan University contains a 

 double-headed milk snake, Ophibolus doliatus triangulus (Boie). He 

 added: "Cases of monstrosities among serpents have been observed 

 by various parties from the time of Aristotle and Redi to the present, 

 and they, as well as the occurrence of monsters in general, may be due 

 to shock." 



Concerning two-headed turtles I can find but one reference, viz., Dr. 

 Mitchill, loc. cit., says : " I have heard of a two-headed tortoise (Testudo) 

 that lived to accfuire a considerable size, by having taken food at both 

 mouths." 



But two notes regarding malformation among batrachians are at 

 hand. One of these is by Dr. Kingsley, loc. cit., in which he records 

 a specimen of a five-legged frog, Rana palustris, from Rochester, New 

 York. The other, by Smith, loc. cit., refers to a mention by Ryder •* 

 of another five-legged frog of the same species. 



During the past fifteen years examples of four two-headed snakes, 

 one two-headed turtle, one five-legged frog and one two-tailed sala- 

 mander from Indiana have come to my notice. While I have seen but 

 two of the individuals, the records of the others can be relied upon. 



Two-headed Snakes, a. Of the snakes, one at hand as I write is a 

 specimen of the spreading viper, Heterodon platyrhinus Latr., six and a 

 half inches in length, taken near Manilla, Rush county, by S. C. Peck 

 in August, 1904, and by him presented to the State Museum. It has 

 two perfect heads, both possessing the scale formula of the species. 

 Each head stands out at nearly right angles to the median line of the 

 front extremity of the body, the center or keel of the two rostral plates 

 being 22 mm. apart. The two heads unite just back of the hindmost 

 of the inner lower labials, there being three rows of small scales between 

 the inner upper labials. Viewed from above, the right head appears 



Geol. Surv. of Ohio, IV, 18S2, 690. 

 ' Science News, December 15, 1878, p. 69 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 421 



very slightly longer than the left, but when compressed together there 

 is no difference, each one being 13 nrni. in length. The two oesophagi 

 unite in a common gullet just back of the point of union. In all other 

 respects the specimen is a typical young form of H. platyrhinus. 



b. A small two-headed garter snake was taken on a farm southwest 

 of Russellville, Putnam county, and was kept in alcohol for several 

 years. It was reported to me by several parties who had seen it, but 

 was thrown out on account of decay, due to loss of alcohol, several 

 weeks before I visited the place. The heads were said to unite about 

 two inches back of the rostral plate, each having a small portion of the 

 body between it and the point of union. 



c. In June, 1893, a friend reported to me that his son had killed a 

 two-headed snake in a woods pasture near Terre Haute. In company 

 with the boy I visited the spot the next day, but found that the buz- 

 zards had been ahead of me and that only a small portion of the body 

 was left. It was a house or milk snake, Ophiholus doUatus triangulus 

 (Boie), and, judging from the fragments and the account of the boy, 

 had been about two and a half feet in length. He said that the heads 

 forked five or six inches back from the front extremity of the body. 



d. In the Indianapolis News of July 19, 1893, John CoUett, ex-State 

 Geologist of Indiana, mentions a "double-headed garter snake as 

 having been taken west of the Wabash river in Vermillion county a 

 few years previously. ' ' 



Two-headed Turtle. — On May 1, 1892, John Tiley, a coal operator, 

 found, near Waterman, in the southwest corner of Fountain county, 

 Indiana, a two-headed turtle. It was presented to Dr. George T. 

 De Verter, who kept it for more than a year, when by accident it was 

 drowned. It was presented in alcohol to Prof. John Collett, of Indiana- 

 polis, and, according to the Indianapolis News of July 19, 1893, had 

 "nothing to distinguish it from the ordinary little river turtle that 

 sits with a row of fellows on a log and plunks into the water when you 

 creep up with designs upon its freedom. Its back appears a little 

 broader than usual to give it neck room. The heads are not joined and 

 do not interfere with each other's independence. Each has its little 

 sack to retreat into in time of danger. Each has two fully developed 

 eyes, a complete and efficacious mouth and a full throat which is 

 beautifully striped in black and yellow lines. Each has a little stripe 

 of red retreating from each eye, and the heads are twins in size. Either 

 head would have been good enough to serve a turtle of ordinary ambi- 

 tion. ' ' 



The News published a crude drawing of the turtle, and from it and the 

 28 




422 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



above description, I judge that the animal was very probably a speci- 

 men of the lady turtle, Chrysemys marginata (Agassiz). Dr. De Verter 

 informed the writer that when kept in an aquarium and fed, each head 

 acted wholly independently of the other, the two being thrust forth 

 for different articles of food — meat, mosquito larvae, tadpoles, etc. — at 

 the same time or at intervals, as occasion and opportunity demanded. 

 Wliat finally became of the specimen on the death of Prof. Collett is 

 not known. 



Five-legged Frog. — In the spring of 1892, while teaching zoology at 

 Terre Haute, I heard several times of a five-legged frog at a greenhouse 

 in that city. I finally visited the place, but the specimen could not be 

 located. The proprietor informed me that lie had seen it on a number 

 of occasions, and had caught it once and then let it go. According to 

 his description, it was probably a specimen of the leopard frog, Rana 

 virescens Kalm, with a fifth leg of the same size as each of the two 

 front ones, which was joined to the left side about an inch back of and 

 a little higher than the normal front leg. The specimen was not seen 

 after my visit and probably fell a victim to some prowling cat. 



Two-tailed Salamander. — On June 21, 1906, I took from an ancient 

 shell mound which was being excavated near Shoals, Martin county, 

 a small specimen of the ashy salamander, Plethodon cinereus (Green), 

 which possesses a forked tail. The animal itself was only 38 mm. in 

 length, the tail comprising 12 mm., or nearly one-third. At a point 

 near the middle the tail forked, the two prongs being separated in life 

 by an angle of about 30 degrees. The left or longer fork was 7 mm. in 

 length, while the right or shorter one was but 5 mm. long. Instead of 

 being cylindrical as in typical specimens, each portion was flattened, 

 with rather sharp edges above and below. 



It is very probable that cases of malformation among reptiles and 

 batrachians are much more common than is generally supposed. It 

 is safe to say that not more than ten per cent, of the normal individuals 

 which are born or hatched ever come within the range of man's vision. 

 The great majority of the malformed ones are, like those of the 

 domestic animals, either still-born or short-lived. The number of 

 specimens of ' ' freaks ' ' which come to the notice of man is, therefore, 

 doubtless a very small per cent, of those which actually occur. 



To the factor of natural variation,. rather than that of "shock," is 

 probably due the malformations which do occur. If but three speci- 

 mens out of 120 of one brood of snakes were malformed on account of 

 a shock to the pregnant mother, why did not that shock affect the 

 others?

Known to me from the single example described above. It is close to 

 the figure of C. mexicanus by Vaillant and Bocourt, which species 

 according to Dr. Regan is undovibtedly identical with C. parallelus. C. 

 gabhi differs from the aforementioned figure in the third dorsal spine 

 being shorter than the fourth, the shorter spine of the rayed anal, the 

 comparatively shorter second anal spine, which is but a trifle longer 

 than the third, and several other characters, such as the presence of 

 more preorbital serrse, etc.

Botanizing in the Canadian Rockies. — Mr. Stewardson Brow^n 

 remarked that during the past summer, through the liberality of Mrs. 

 Charles Schaffer, June and July were spent in studying the plants of 

 the Canadian Rockies, along the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway. 



The section explored was from Banff, Alberta, to Glacier, B. C, with 

 side trips into the region surrounding Lake Louise, to the south of 

 Laggan Station, and the Ptarmigan, Blind, and part of the Pipestone 

 Valleys to the north; Lake O'Harra, Emerald Lake, the Yoho and 

 Little Yoho Valleys, in the vicinity of Field, B. C. 



Collections were made consisting of 808 numbers, comprising about 

 one-third as many species and more than 4,000 specimens. 



As these have not yet been critically studied it is impossible to 

 indicate how many may be new to science; it is reasonable to suppose, 

 however, that there are some novelties among them. The species

forming the forest east of the divide appear to differ considerably 

 from those of the west, due doubtless to the greater precipitation of 

 moisture on the latter region. Near the limit of timber and in open 

 ground, where the effect of such conditions would not be so marked, 

 they appear to be nearly identical.

Weather Predictions. — Mr. Harvey M. Watts remarked that a new 

 epoch is about to dawn in meteorological research, in that the United 

 States Weather Bureau expects within a month to receive daily 

 reports from the entire northern (circum-Polar) hemisphere — Europe, 

 Siberia, Alaska, and so on around from west to east — allowing the 

 meteorologists for the first time to have synoptic charts made cover- 

 ing this immense area of the inhabited globe. 



In explaining the significance of this, Mr. Watts went into a careful 

 survey of the great basic causes of weather and climate variations. 

 He called attention to the universal drift of the general circulation 

 from west to east about the Pole in the regions north of the Tropics, in 

 which general circulation are carried by the travelling cyclones and 

 anti-cyclones (centers of low and high barometric pressures), and he 

 indicated how the paths of these travelling eddies were determined by 

 the pressures and location of the sub-Tropical high pressure belts, 

 which form in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans huge permanent anti- 

 cyclones, upon whose seasonal shifting and variations in pressure 

 depend the general variations in weather and climate. 



The speaker called attention to the fact that the variation in place 

 and pressure of these anti-cyclones (the sub-Tropical high pressure 

 belts), it was now held generally by meteorologists, were due to varia- 

 tions in the radiation from the sun. It is known that the sun is a 

 variable star, whose radiation varies from time to time as much as 

 ten per cent. 



These solar variations affect the pressure in the sub-Tropical region, 

 and the variations in the pressures in the sub-Tropical region in turn 

 affect atmospheric pressures the earth over, determining the path of 

 storms and clear weather phenomena, and also general climatic effects, 

 such as excessive rains, droughts, hot and cold summers and their 

 contraries.

These examples seem to agree best with Tetragonopterus orientalis 

 Cope. The discrepancies in the depth of the body may be accounted 

 for by age, as the younger ones are more elongate. The anterior anal 

 rays are however much longer than the others. The eye was evidently 

 found to be 3 in the head, which also may possibly be attributed to 

 age, though my examples show it but a little less than interorbital 



Tetragonopterus viejita Valenciennes may be closely related or 

 identical, as it agrees in some respects, though it is impossible to con- 

 sider it on account of the imperfect diagnosis.

 posterior edge emarginate. Greatest width of infraorbital rim 

 greater than greatest exposed breadth of opercle.

Scales mostly fallen, cycloid, each with several striae, thin, large, not 

 narrowly imbricated, and apparently disposed in longitudinal series 

 parallel with lateral line. Base of anal apparently with a low sheath 

 of small scales. Base of caudal also covered with small scales. Lateral 

 line apparently as usual or a little decurved, then sloping up to base of 

 caudal, though a little low at first along side of caudal peduncle. 

 Tubes simple.

 behind base of last dorsal ray, also nearer base of caudal than origin of 

 pectoral, and anterior rays apparently elongated. Caudal forked, 

 lobes apparently pointed. Pectoral small, evidently not attaining

 midway between origin of pectoral and that of anal, and perhaps 

 reaching(?) latter.

The above account agrees largely with Dr. Giinther's, though the eye 

 is larger and the maxillary extends to the front margin of the eye in 

 his examples. In mine there are indistinct traces of both caudal and 

 humeral spots which I suspect have more or less faded.

Though I allow the above specimens of this species as distinct from 

 Megalobrycon cephalus Giinther, it is possible that they may be found 

 identical. Cope pointed out that M. melanopterum differs in the outer 

 series of teeth in the upper jaw being more than double the size of 

 those on the maxillary, as stated for M. cephalus by Dr. Giinther. 

 The apparently uniform coloration is a feature of striking difference, 

 and as Dr. Giinther's examples were 13 inches long, may be one of 

 age. Brycon falcatus Miiller and Troschel, from Guiana, is also related.

 maxillary 2f to 3^; length of depressed pectoral (mostly damaged) 

 about 2^ to 3 ; length of examples 3^ to 6|- inches. 



Cope's figure, which however may not have been drawn from the 

 specimen which is here restricted as the type, differs in having the 

 abdominal profile more undulate, the absence of mandibular cirri, 

 the radii of anal anteriorly much lower, and the adipose fin too small. 

 The mandibular cirri are present in most every case examined, though 

 in the adult they are much shorter and inconspicuous. 



Granting Dr. Giinther's argument concerning Agassiz's figure of 

 Chalceus angulatus, it is reasonably certain that my specimens belong 

 to that species.

This species has apparently been confused, and it is not improbable 

 that Chalcinus rotundatus (Jardine) may be found really the name 

 applicable. Jardine's figure and account are, however, too crude and 

 incomplete to permit of certain identification. In fact the anterior 

 position of the dorsal fin as indicated by the figure would point more to 

 C. angulatus (Agassiz). Under C. hrachipomus, the statement '*la 

 dorsale est assez reculee sur la dos et presque opposee a I'anale qui 

 est longue et basse" by Valenciennes, may perhaps be better referred to 

 that designated as C. hrachy-pomus by Dr. Giinther. I see no reason 

 for Prof. Garman indicating Dr. Giinther's examples as identical with 

 the one from the Amazons under a new name, which is afterwards 

 accepted by Dr. and Mrs. Eigenmann. These latter writers, and also 

 Prof. Ulrey, unite Chalceus angulatus Agassiz with Chalcinus hrachi- 

 pomus Valenciennes, a proceeding which I am unable to accept. The 

 latter may be distinguished from the former by the more posterior 

 insertion of the dorsal.

 brownish dots, and median rays of latter all more or less deep brown. 

 Iris brownish. Length 6 inches. Type. 



The 2 examples from the Peruvian Amazon show : Head 3f 

 to 4; depth 3f ; D. ii, 9; A. iv, 28 or 29; scales about 40 (squama- 

 tion injured) in lateral line to base of caudal, and 3 or 4 more 

 on latter; about 8 scales (according to pockets) obliquely back from 

 origin of dorsal to lateral line, and 3 between latter and origin of anal; 

 about 23 to 25 (squamation injured) before dorsal ; mandible 3^ to 3^ in 

 head; snout 4f to 4f in head, measured from tip of lower jaw; eye 4^ 

 to 4|; interorbital space 3^ to 3J; pectoral 3 in head and trunk; length 

 of fishes (caudal damaged) 8| inches. 



As with Triportheus flavus and T. albus Cope's figure does not show 

 the mandibular cirrus, a character present in all of the examples of the 

 present species, though smaller in the larger. The dark median 

 basal blotch on the caudal is also not shown on his figure.

Head 3^; depth 3; D. 11, 9; A. iii, 42, this fin damaged posteriorly, 

 a fact overlooked apparently by Cope, which would thus account for 

 "A. 37"; P. I, 12?; V. i, 7; scales about 46? (squamation injured) in 

 course of lateral line to base of caudal; there are also probably 12? 

 scales between lateral line and origin of anal, instead of 10 as noted by 

 Cope; width of head 2f in its length; depth of head, over middle of 

 or!)it, about If; snout 4; eye 3|^; maxillary If; interorbital space 3^; 

 mandible If; least depth of caudal peduncle 3f . The other characters 

 do not appear to me to differ from those of Anacyrtus sanguineus 

 Cope. The palatine teeth(?) are obsolete, due possibly to preservation. 

 Coloration, as described by Cope, also agrees with A. sanguineus. 

 Further, it may be stated that the anterior free margins of the nasal 

 bones are not more prolonged than in A. sanguineus, and overhang 

 the nostrils in a similar manner. Type of Anacyrtus tectifer Cope. 



The cotypes of Anacyrtus sanguineus Cope show: Head 3| to 3f ; 

 depth 2t to 3; D. 11, 9; A. iv, 39, i to iv, 41, i; scales 46 to 52 in lateral

line to base of caudal with apparently several more on latter; 12 scales 

 obliquely back from origin of dorsal to lateral line; 12 scales between 

 lateral line and origin of anal; snout 3^ to 4 in head; eye 3 to 4f ; 

 maxillary 1^ to If; interorbital space 3f to 4; pectoral If to If; ventral 

 If to If; total length of body Iff to 4f inches. 



Young examples differ somewhat from the adult. The scales on 

 the back are much smaller and crowded in appearance. The origin 

 of the anal begins but a trifle behind that of the dorsal in the vertical, 

 and the anterior portion of the fin is deep. Ventral reaches well 

 beyond origin of anal. The maxillary falls a little short of the pos- 

 terior orbital margin. 



Cope's figure is evidently a little faulty in that the origin of the 

 anal is opposite that of the dorsal, and the spine on the shoulder-girdle 

 in front of the base of the pectoral is omitted.

I am indebted to Mr. Barton A. Bean for the data concerning this 

 fish. According to him it approaches Xiphostoma hujeta Valenciennes, 

 a species very imperfectly described though, which it seems to resemble 

 so far as the original account permits. Provisionally at least it had 

 best be considered distinct.

 little^ larger than pupil, those below smallest. Membrane of fins 

 more or less dusky-brown, dorsal paler, and also bases of caudal, 

 pectoral and ventral pale. Lips dusky or brownish. Iris yellowish. 

 Length 5|- inches (caudal damaged).

Cope's statement, that ''the two posterior mandibulars are in con- 

 tact with the median pair of the anterior series, and are separated by 

 a narrow interspace from each other," evidently refers to the teeth 

 of the upper jaw.

This example agrees largely with Agassiz' figure. However, the 

 scales on the base of the anal fin are not indicated as sharply demar- 

 cated from the rest of the same, so that in width this squamous area is 

 but a little broader anteriorly.

ON SOME FISHES OF WESTERN CUBA. 



BY N. E. McINDOO. 



During the latter part of June and the first part of July, Mr. J, D. 

 Haseman and the writer, under the auspices of the Zoological Depart- 

 ment of Indiana University, visited twenty-one caves between Ala- 

 cranes and Canas, Cuba, in order to secure embryos of the blind fishes — 

 Stygicola and Lucifuga. 



We also collected fishes in the fresh waters and in the ocean at 

 Marianao and at Batabano. These are enumerated in the present 

 paper. The expenses were in part provided by a grant from the 

 Carnegie Institution. 



After collecting blind fishes we made our headquarters at the Estacion 

 Central Agronomica de Cuba, located at Santiago de las Vegas. I wish 

 to express our appreciation for the niunerous favors which the Director, 

 Prof. E, S. Earle, of the Station, showed us. 



Localities Visited. 



Lagunas Castellanos. Two and one-half miles southwest of Santiago 

 de las Vegas there are three small lagoons situated in a narrow valley. 

 These lagoons are called the ' ' I.agunas Castellanos.' ' Laguna Castel- 

 lan© No. 1 covers about five acres, has steep banks; its bottom is a 

 mixtiu-e of mud and gravel, and its water is comparatively clear. 



Laguno Castellano No. 2 lies about three hundred yards north of No. 

 1. It is not as large as No. 1. Its banks are very sloping and covered 

 with aquatic plants which extend into the water one-third the distance 

 to the center. The bottom is deep, black mud. The water is very 

 muddy. 



We did not visit Laguna Castellano No. 3, which is somewhat larger 

 than either of the other two and lies a half mile due west of them. 



All the fishes we caught in the clear water of Laguna Castellano No. 1 

 are dark in color; those that came from the muddy Castellano No. 2 

 are light in color. 



Rio Almendares. We seined in the Almendares river at Calabazar 

 for a half mile below the wagon bridge. Under the bridge the water 

 is deep and swift, but thirty feet below the stream widens and the 

 water is shallow. Here the bottom is covered with gravel and large 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 485 



rocks. It was scarcely possible to seine with success in the river below 

 this point on account of the swift water and steep banks. 



Batabano lies on the southern shore of Cuba, nearly due south of 

 Havana. The country about Batabano is very low, a semi-swamp. 

 The entu-e region between Havana and Batabano, with the exception 

 of a few miles drained by the Almendares river, is drained by under- 

 ground streams. One of these finds its exist at the Vento Springs, near 

 Havana, and supplies Havana with its water. Two others find 

 their exit near Batabano, one of which arises some distance inland 

 from Batabano and sends a stream six to ten feet wide and about two 

 feet deep through the central part of Batabano. 



The other stream arises about three hundred yards from the ocean 

 and flows through the western part of the town. The water is clear and 

 sluggish. Both of these streams run due south and empty into the 

 ocean one-fourth of a mile apart. We seined in the larger stream just 

 north of town, where the water was rather sluggish and the bottom 

 muddy. We used the dip net in town, because it was impossible to 

 handle the seine among the stakes along the banks. 



While at Batabano we seined in the ocean along the western side of 

 the wharf, and at the mouth of the small stream in the western part 

 of town. The water is very shallow and the bottoms muddy. Our 

 success was very poor. 



Marianao is a small town eight miles west of Ha\'ana. On account 

 of the rough rocks which form tide pools, it was impossible to use the 

 seine at Marianao, but three-fourths of a mile northwest the water is 

 shallow and the rocks are covered with sand. Here we had success 

 with the seine. Between this place and Marianao we caught several 

 fishes in the tide pools with our hands or with dip net. The following 

 species were collected in these various localities. 



Fresh-Water Fishes. 

 PCEOILIID^. 



The members of this family are ever^-where abundant. 

 Cyprinodon riverendi (Pocy). 



Six small specimens from the stream just north of Batabano. 

 Fundulus cubensis Eigenmann. 



Four small specimens from the stream just north of Batabano. This 

 species seems to be rather rare. It has so far been recorded from 

 Pinar del Rio only. 

 Gambusia punctata Poey. 



Everj^vhere abundant. Both males and females were caught in the 




486 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



Almendares river at Calabazar, at the mo\ith of a small stream empty- 

 ing into the ocean at Marianao and Lagima Castellano No. 2. The 

 specimens from this lagoon are very light colored and have a more 

 elongate body than the other specimens. 

 Gambusia puncticulata Poey. 



Very abundant. Our specimens were caught at Calabazar and in 

 Laguna Castellano No. 1. Those from the latter place were collected 

 by Prof. Baker, of the Estacion Central Agronomica de Cuba. 

 Poecilia vittata Guichenot. 



Found everywhere. Our specimens from Lagunas Castellanos Nos. 

 1 and 2, from Calabazar and from the stream north of Batabano. All 

 the specimens from Laguna Castellano No. 1 are dark colored; both 

 males and females were caught in Laguna Castellano No. 2 and every 

 one is light in color. All the females contain eggs. Those caught at 

 Calabazar and at Batabano are dark colored, which is due to the clear 

 water. 



OIOHLID^. 



The individuals of the genus Heros are quite common everywhere. 

 They are as abundant in the streams of western Cuba as are the sun 

 fishes in Indiana. They vary greatly in coloration. 



Heros tetracanthus (Cuvier & Valenciennes). 



Many specimens caught in the Lagunas Castellanos. Those from 

 Laguno Castellano No. 1 are very dark colored; some of them are dark 

 brown and approach a black, while others are much lighter in color. 

 Most of the scales with a dark brown spot at base, these spots forming 

 faint longitudinal series; head, preoperculum and operculum darker 

 than other parts of body; preoperculum with three almost black length- 

 wise streaks; dorsal, anal, and caudal with dark spots. 



The following is the color description of a specimen from Laguna 

 Castellano No. 2. Background flesh color, black dots forming indis- 

 tinct and discontinuous longitudinal streaks; snout ashy without dark 

 spots; preoperculum and operculum with four discontinuous length- 

 wise streaks; ventrals and anal ashy; pectorals flesh color; caudal 

 without basal spot; caudal and dorsal with dark spots. 

 Heros tetracanthus cinctus Eigenmann. 



From Laguna Castellano No. 2 and the stream north of Batabano. 

 Those from Laguna Castellano No. 2, as all other specimens from the 

 same place, are light in color. Each one is barred conspicuously. 

 The specimens collected at Batabano are much darker.

NEW ORIBATID^ FROM THE UNITED STATES. 

 BY NATHAN BANKS. 



The Oribaticlce, or "beetle-mites" as they have been called because 

 of their hard teguments, have been but little collected or studied in our 

 country. In 1895 the writer described those he had observed on Long 

 Island, N. Y., and a few others. In 1896 a few more were added to the 

 list. Now I describe twenty-four more, from various parts of the country. 



Our Oribatid fauna is similar to that of Eiu-ope, so far but one or 

 two peculiar genera; but we have a larger percentage of smooth species, 

 as Galumna, Oribatula, and fewer of the roughened species, as Notaspis, 

 Nothrus, and Cepheus. The genus Pelops, represented in Europe by 

 ten or twelve species, has not yet been found in North America. 

 Galumna slossonae n. sp. 



Color, dark brown, a pale spot at base of abdomen, legs pale. Cepha- 

 lothorax with a long lamella each side, its apical third free and pointed, 

 bearing a rather short bristle; a narrower lamella or ridge on each outer 

 edge, ending in a short bristle ; superior bristles long, erect ; pseudostig- 

 matic organ long, clavate at tip. Abdomen longer than broad, smooth, 

 with six rather thickened bristles each side, two toward humerus, four 

 near tip ; wings quite long, not one-half as high as long ; genital opening 

 about twice its length in front of the larger anal opening; sternum 

 with three lines each side, middle pair longest. Legs quite long antl 

 slender; femora I and II very broad, femur II with a pointed lobe at 

 tip beneath; all tibiae with two stout spines at tip, one on patella II, 

 and one below tarsi IV; three strongly unequal claws, the middle one 

 xery much larger than the others; a large tectopedium behind coxa I. 



Length .5 mm. 



From Franconia, N. H. (Mrs. A. T. Slosson.) 



Galumna unimaculata n. sp. 



Color, red brown, a yellowish spot at base of the abdomen. Cepha- 

 lothorax with a rather broad lamella each side, its apical fourth free, 

 tip slightly emarginate, and with a short bristle ; superior bristles rather 

 fine, long; pseud ostigmatic organ not very long, clavate at tip. Abdo- 

 men large, globose, rather longer than broad, four pale smooth spots 

 on each side, the basal pair much larger than the others; nine bristles

each side, two submedian toward base, one humeral, rather longer 

 than others, four on posterior part, and two on the posterior margin; 

 wings large, nearly as high as long, projecting a little in front of 

 the abdomen, evenly rounded below; both wings and abdomen 

 evenly, minutely gi'anulate; genital opening twice its length 

 in front of larger anus; venter granulate; sternal plate with two lines 

 each side. Legs short and small, high up on the sides, leg IV not near 

 as long as width of the body ; with fine hairs as usual; three equal claws. 



Length 1 mm. 



Franconia, N. H. (Mrs. A. T. Slosson.) 



Galumna nitidula n. sp. 



Dark red brown, no basal spot on abdomen; legs pale yellowish. 

 Cephalothorax very small and short, a lamella along each side, two- 

 thirds the way to tip, its tip free and ending in a short bristle; superior 

 bristles very short; pseud ostigmatic organ rather short, fusiform. 

 Abdomen plainly longer than broad, high, without hairs, smooth and 

 shining, venter also; wings very small, angulate in front; genital open- 

 ing one and one-half its length in front of much larger anal opening; 

 sternal plate with two furrows across, hind margin of hind coxae run- 

 ning into middle of genital opening; legs very short and small; the tarsi

 concentricus this part is longitudinally striate, and there is no lateral 

 ridge. The apex of the abdomen above is not as high nor as pointed 

 as in N. concentricus. The legs are somewhat shorter, but the most 

 distinct difference in the legs is that in this species there is a large lobe 

 below at apex of each femur, especially large on legs I and II; the tarsi

DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW SPECIES OF POLYCH^TA FROM THE SOUTH- 

 EASTERN COAST OF MASSACHUSETTS. 



BY J. PERCY MOORE. 



Arabella spinifera sp. nov. 



This species is known only from an incomplete worm consisting of 

 the prostomium and fifty-one anterior segments and measuring 18 mm. 

 long and 2 mm. in diameter, indicating a form less elongated than 

 Arabella opalina Verrill, 



Prostomium subcorneal, very slightly depressed, acute, more than 

 twice as long as the basal width; sides straight; ventral longitudinal 

 grooves close together and very faint. The noteworthy elongation 

 of the prostomium may be abnormal, resulting from an injury at the 

 base. Eyes two, rather large, conspicuous, situated on the dorsum 

 close to the posterior border of the prostomium and separated by a 

 space of less than one-third the basal width of the prostomium. 

 Palps rudimentary, or at least not visible from the exterior, and 

 enclosed by the margins of the lips. 



Peristomium and somite II clearly separated by a deep furrow, both 

 dorsally and ventrally ;both simple apodous rings, the former slightly the 

 longer. Posterior lip smooth. Fort-bearing somites all very short, 

 about 5-8 times as wide as long, all clearly defined by distinct furrows, 

 simple in structure, and decidedly more arched dorsally than ventrally, 

 making a subterete bodj'. 



Parapodia begin on III. The first (Plate XIX, fig. 3) consists of a 

 small but prominent notopodium, and a neurapodium which is divided 

 into a short and stout, rounded presetal lobe supported by a single 

 stout aciculum, and a similarly formed but slightly longer postsetal lobe, 

 which is ventral and only slightly posterior to the former. Remaining 

 parapodia (fig. 4) are prominent, and the postsetal or ventral lobe is 

 elongated into a stout cirriform branchial organ containing a large 

 vascular loop. For the length of the piece the parapodia undergo no 

 change, except, first, a slight increase in size of the postsetal lobe and, 

 second, a scarcely perceptible reduction of it in the last ten or twelve 

 somites. 



On the fii'st two or three parapodia the acicula do not project 

 beyond the surface, but the neuropodia of all others are supported by 




502 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [Nov., 



two deep yellow acicula, the ends of which are exposed as in certain 

 species of Drilonereis and Aracoda. The dorsalmost (fig. 5, a) is much 

 the stouter and the end is blunt ; the more ventral (fig. 5, b), besides 

 being more slender, is prolonged into an acute spinous process, which is 

 frequently broken off. Further caudad the larger aciculum becomes 

 still stouter and more distinctly curved. Two or three very fine 

 acicula reach to the base of the notopodial tubercle (fig. 4). 



On the first somite the setse are all in a small, nearly vertical fascicle 

 between the two lobes, but they quickly rotate to a more oblique 

 position and divide into an oblique supra-acicular group and a horizon- 

 tal subacicular group. The former usually contains two pairs of 

 doubly curved, very acute, limbate setse with strongly striated stems 

 and finely denticulated margins (fig. 6) ; these are turned with profile 

 dorsal and ventral. Subacicular setse are two or three in a horizontal 

 row, turned so that in preparations of the parapodia both blades come 

 into view symmetrically; the blades are shorter and the tips more pro- 

 longed than on the supra-acicular setse (fig. 7). Dorsal setse yellow, 

 ventral nearly colorless. 



Mandibles (fig. 2) brown, with exposed tips white. The two halves 

 merely touch without uniting and then diverge both distally and proxi- 

 mally; dentinal plate not clearly differentiated from the carrier and 

 nearly equal to it in length; the former curved, divergent, ending in a 

 blunt white tip, without marginal teeth; the latter relatively short, 

 broad at distal, tapering to proximal end, divergent. Maxillse (fig. 1) 

 brown, four pairs, all but the first pair (forcep jaws) alternating in posi- 

 tion and more or less asymmetrical. Carriers of forceps filiform, about 

 twice the length of the series of jaws; the two halves coalesced near the 

 end, thickened, then constricted and again enlarged at the distal end ; 

 the forceps roughly triangular, with three stout, hooked teeth along the 

 medial margin of the basal half and the ends strongly hooked. The 

 first accessory plate on the left side longer than the forceps plate, with a 

 large hooked distal tooth and seven stout teeth gradually becoming 

 smaller toward the proximal end , All of the remaining j aw plates differ 

 little in size, but become successively somewhat smaller toward the 

 anterior end; each is supported by two broad divergent wings and the 

 dentinal ridge bears 4-6 conspicuous, slender, claw-like teeth, one or 

 two of the anterior usually being enlarged. 



Color of preserved specimen: anterior end and parapodia rich yellow, 

 pale farther back ; the cuticle only slightly iridescent. 



The type and only known specimen (A. N. S. No. 2313) was found 

 among a lot of Ninoe nigripes Verrill dredged on the muddy bottom of 

 the middle of Buzzard's Bay, Mass., the exact spot being unknown.

Praxillella tricirrata sp. nov. 



What appears to be an imdescribecl species of Praxillella is imper- 

 fectly represented by several fragments, one consisting of the head and 

 nine metastomial segments, of which the head and five segments are 

 in process of regeneration, a second of somites VI to XII inclusive, and 

 a third of the pygidium and eight preanal segments, the first five of 

 which are setigeroiis. 



This is a larger species than F. zonalis or P. clongata, having a 

 diameter of 3 mm. and an estimated length of about 150 mm. The only 

 known anterior end, being in process of regeneration, presents an ab- 

 normal appearance, somewhat approximating that of a Nicomache or 

 Lumhriclymene. The entire regenerating region, consisting of the 

 prostomium and six somites, has a length of a trifle more than 3 mm. 

 and barely exceeds the sixth segment. 



Head very short, with the cephalic plate and limbate margin scarcely 

 developed. There is a rather thick, short and broad palpode, and run- 

 ning back from it a narrower but, relatively to the width of the head, 

 broad median ridge bounded on each side by the deep and conspicuous 

 sensory clefts, which again are bounded laterally by the low folds from 

 which the limbate margins wiU develop, the whole forming a narrow 

 area scarcely exceeding one-third of the entire width of the head and 

 sloping steeply downward anteriorly. Mouth a rather large crescentic 

 opening bounded by the narrow^ furrowed persitomial lip. Peristo- 

 mium very short and uniannular. 



Somites II to VI are about twice as long as wide, slightly compressed, 

 distinctly biannular, decreasing slightly in diameter to the last, and 

 with the furrows, except ^^ which is obscm-e, well defined. No 

 distinct collars. The integuments of this region arc soft and delicate 

 and a careful examination discloses no developed setse, though the 

 setigerous glands are visible on some segments. 



The first normally developed segment (VI) is cylindrical, quite as 

 long as the preceding part of the worm, and 2-3 times as thick; VII 

 and VIII are c^uite similar; IX and X are united into one joint about 

 four times as long as wide and without any dividing furrow; XI is 

 slightly longer than VIII, and XII stiU longer. Except ^^ all 

 furrows in this region are deep and distinct; the segments somewhat 

 depressed and distinctly flattened ventrally. On VI, VII and VIII 

 the parapodia are situated one-third of the length of the segment from 

 its anterior end, and all of the area anterior to them is occupied by a 

 thick, whitish, glandular zone; a similar zone exists on IX, while on X a 

 thick, rugous, ventral, glandular area of triangular form extends 




504 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [NoV., 



forward from and between the posterior tori to an apex halfway to the 

 tori of IX, whence a narrow median ventral ridge continues it forward 

 to the glandular zone of IX; XI and XII have no glandular areas, 

 though the tori form prominent swellings near their posterior ends. 



The posterior segments are much contracted and distorted, but it is 

 evident that they consist normally of a slender, very contractile, and 

 wrinkled anterior portion, and a short, enlarged, posterior parapodial 

 portion. They decrease in length regularly to the pygidium, which is 

 preceded by three achsetous segments, of w^hich the fu'st closely re- 

 sembles the last setigerous in size, and has posterior swellings repre- 

 senting the parapodia ; the next is about one-half and the next one- 

 fourth as long, widest posteriorly, where there are slight parapodial 

 thickenings. The last two gradually widen into the base of the 

 pygidium. 



Pygidium (Plate XIX, fig. 8) with a short basal ring resembling the 

 last achffitous segment, and bearing a thick posterior anal disk, the 

 margin of which is provided with a median ventral cirrus and a pair of 

 lateral, long, slender cirri each having a length of f the diameter of the 

 disk, together with a circle of very regular prominent teeth of which five 

 are between the median and each of the lateral cirri, and fifteen between 

 the two latter on the dorsum. Anus occupying the centre of a low, regu- 

 lar, finely furrowed cone, and closed by a thick, fleshy papilla, which 

 arises from its ventral margin and bends dorsad. The usual raised nem-al 

 line runs for the entire length and passes on to the ventral cirrus, 



Setse and uncini are undeveloped on the regenerating segments. 

 They are sessile on VI-IX and borne on small papillae and promi- 

 nent tori on all the others. Anteriorly the seta form small but very 

 prominent, vertical, linear tufts, which become more compact pos- 

 teriorly. They are similar on all segments. Anterior tufts contain 

 10-12 longer, stouter, slightly curved, narrowly limbate setse (fig. 9), 

 with long, capillary tips, and nearly twice as many slender, capillary, 

 wingless setse, partly smooth and partly bipinnate, with fine hairs 

 (fig. 10), Farther back they become longer but fewer and in more 

 compact bundles, and most of the wingless setse are smooth. 



The anterior thoracic crochets are of course unknown. On other 

 segments there are 15-19, the larger numbers behind. They are pale 

 yellow, strongly striated, with rather slender stem, slightly con- 

 stricted to form a neck, but lacking a distinct shoulder; an expanded 

 head with a short, stout beak; a low crest with about four large and 

 two or three small, diminishing teeth flanked by small fibrous teeth; 

 and a conspicuous guard composed of 5-6 stout flattened hairs united 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 505 



at the base and in contact with the lower surface of the beak to its 

 tip, above which they arch and recurve in a bold circle (figs. 11 and 12). 



Living color and tube unknown. Filled with eggs on Sept. 2. 

 Taken on two occasions at Crab Ledge, east of Chatham, Mass., in 

 17-20 fathoms, on a stony and gravelly bottom, and not found else- 

 where. (Type No. 1253, Academy of Natural Sciences of Phila.) 

 Cirratulus parvus sp. nov. 



Form very slender, terete, nearly linear, but most slender and attenu- 

 ated posteriorly. Length 20-30 (usually about 25) mm., diameter 

 about .6 mm. Number of segments 60-75. 



Prostomium and peristomium united to form a distinct head (fig. 

 13). Prostomium broad and flat, broader than long, its width nearly 

 two-thirds widest part of body, shaped like the blade of a gravedigger's 

 shovel ; the upper surface with a pair of obliquely transverse sensory slits 

 at the place of union with the peristomiiun ; the ventral surface some- 

 what thickened and divided by a longitudinal fissure. Eyes, one pair, 

 conspicuous, rounded or slightly elongated obliquely, widely separated 

 on middle of head, close to the sensory slits. 



Peristomium a simple, somewhat swollen ring, scarcely differentiated 

 from the prostomium above, but elsewhere clearly defined and forming 

 a straight and smooth lip behind the relatively large mouth. Next two 

 segments (II and III) simple rings with a diameter equal to the peris- 

 tomium and a combined length equalling the entire length of the head. 



Setigerous and branchiate somites begin with IV, which is slightly 

 enlarged. They are at first quite short, but rapidly lengthen without 

 corresponding increase in diameter until the length nearly or quite 

 equals the diameter. Posteriorly they again diminish in length and at 

 the caudal end is a short region of not clearly defined segments. All 

 somites simple and uniannular, and the intersegmental furrows smooth 

 and clear cut. Although the body is nearly terete the ventral surface 

 is somewhat flattened and the parapodia somewhat projecting. Pygi- 

 dium bearing a minute pointed projection below a nearly circular, 

 dorsal anus. 



Parapodia begin on IV and continue to posterior end; they are small, 

 ventro-lateral projections bearing separate notopodial and neuropodial 

 tubercles. 



Branchial cirri also begin on IV just above the parapodia, and a pair 

 occurs on each segment for about twenty, after which they are borne on 

 every second or third segment and finally more scatteringly nearly to 

 the posterior end. Cirri of the middle and posterior region are borne 

 at the posterior margin of the segments some distance above the para- 




506 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [NoV., 



podia. They are slender, filiform and round, often half as long a? the 

 body and with the base constricted so that they are easily detached. 



Dorsal gills usually two pairs, sometimes a rudimentary third one on 

 one or both sides, placed side by side on the dorsum of IV just above the 

 parapodium and a little behind the branchial cirrus. They are slender 

 at the base and swell to about twice the diameter of the branchial cirri, 

 longer than the latter, longitudinally grooved for their entire length, 

 and in contraction crenulate, wrinkled and more or less coiled in an 

 open spiral. 



Setae and spines scarcely differ in form and structure from those of 

 Cirratulus grandis. At the anterior end both notopodial and neuro- 

 podial tufts contain capillary setse only — about 6-8 in each — of various 

 lengths, the longest about two-thirds the body diameter. Spines 

 appear in the neuropodium at about XII, and a few segments farther 

 back each neuropodial tuft contains about four spines and four setse, 

 much shorter than on anterior segments (fig. 14). At the posterior 

 end there are about two of each. In notopodial tufts the setse become 

 fewer and shorter from before backward, but usually spines appear only 

 in those of the posterior one-third. 



Color pale yellow or orange, usually with a greenish tinge, the integu- 

 ments translucent, permitting the dark intestine to show through. 

 Gills and cirri reddish from the contained blood. 



Known only from the deeper waters of Vineyard and Nantucket 

 Sounds, in from 10-19 fathoms, where it lives in colonies among the 

 crevices of Amaroecium pellucidum and in passages of shells. Quite 

 common in the latter at Crab Ledge, ofT Chatham. Nothing definite 

 known of breeding habits, but specimens taken in late August contain 

 small eggs. (Type No. 1657, Academy of Natural Sciences of Phila.) 



This species is easily distinguished from young of Cirratulus grandis 

 of the same size, which are frequently taken under stones at low water, 

 by having but two achsetous segments between the peristomium and 

 first branchial segment. It bears a close superficial resemblance to 

 Cirrhatidus fragilis Leidy, but differs decidedly in that the latter is 

 described and figured as having bifid spines, only one apodous pre- 

 branchial segment, and the branchiae beginning on the second setiger- 

 ous segment. The species recorded under the name Cirrhinereis 

 fragilis Quatrefages as having been dredged in Vineyard Sound, and 

 considered by Verrill to be identical with C. fragilis Leidy, is probabl}^ 

 the species here described. 

 Amphitrite attenuata sp. nov. 



Form slender, clavate, slightly swollen in the anterior thoracic 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 507 



region, slender and tapering behind. Length 30 mm., diameter nearly 

 2 mm. at inflated part of thorax. Number of somites 80, IV- 

 XXVIII setigerous. 



Prostomiiim broad and depressed at the base, produced forward into 

 a rather thick, simple lip, broadly romided, entire and usually curved 

 upward at the anterior margin, little folded about the mouth laterally 

 and not meeting the lower lip ; tentaculif erous ridge in contact with the 

 lateral ends of the lip but separated from it by a slight notch, arched 

 over the dorsum of the prostomium posteriorly and. bearing -in a con- 

 tinuous series about 30 coarse tentacles about one-half the length of 

 the body. No eyes visible. 



Mouth large, bounded below by a ventral lip which is divided bj^ a 

 transverse furrow into an inflated internal portion and a flat external 

 portion, which is very broad and extends laterally beyond, but does 

 not touch the upper lip. Peristomiirai a short, simple ring dorsally, 

 ■expanded ventrally to form the lower lip. Somite II as long as the 

 prostomium and ventral lip combined, its anterior margin without a 

 true collar or lateral wings, but slightly produced as a free rim. Thora- 

 cic region distinctly segmented, the furrow complete and well defined; 

 dorsal region most inflated at X-XII, thence gradually tapered to the 

 abdomen. Abdomen attenuated, nearly quadrate in section, the 

 dorsimi only rounded; the segments becoming very short but all dis- 

 tinctly biannulated, the posterior borders wider and somewhat project- 

 ing. Pygidium a simple, rugous ring. 



Ventral plates 14 (II-XV) all, except the first, sharply defined but 

 in contact with one another; the anterior ones rectangular, 2-4 times 

 .as broad as long, the last fom- elliptical and one and one-half times to 

 twice as broad as long. Posterior to the ventral plates a ventral 

 groove with a raised neural line continues to the posterior end. 



Gills (fig. 15) three pairs, on II, III and IV, decreasing in size from 

 before backwards, all small; when fully extended the first not more 

 than one-half the thoracic diameter, each with a short trunk dividing 

 near the base into 2-4 main branches, each of which then dichotomizes, 

 usually three times and terminates in slender, tapering twigs. 



Setigerous papillae begin on IV just beneath the last gill, and are 

 represented in a corresponding position on III by a minute achsetous, 

 knob-like papilla. Anteriorly they are prominent and at a high level ; 

 posteriorly they shift ventrad and become smaller. First torus on V, 

 about one-half as long as the longest on XII, and one-sixth or one- 

 seventh the body circumference. First five tori separated ventrally 

 "by about three times their length, those on XII by an interval about 




508 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [NoV. 



equal to their length and succeeding ones by a less distance. Pos- 

 terior to the region of ventral plates they become more elevated and 

 prominent, but, though assuming a lappet-form, they never become 

 largely free, even on posterior abdominal segments. 



The characteristic setae arise from short vertical lines in tufts of 

 about a dozen arranged in double series. They (fig. 16) have remark- 

 ably broad limbi, those of the posterior row being shorter than and 

 half again as broad as the one figured; the very slender and much 

 attenuated tip is very long, and the fringe nearly obsolete and confined 

 to the outer end on the long setse, but better developed, though 

 exceedingly delicate, on the short ones. 



Uncini occur in single series pointing forward on V-X, in double 

 series alternating in position and facing each other on XI- XXVIII, 

 then again in single series to the end ; there are about thirty-five on V, 

 sixty on X and XI, thirty-six on XVIII and twenty on L. They are 

 nearly colorless, with short, strongly convex bases deeply notched in 

 front, the beak stout, the crest of four transverse rows of 3-9 teeth 

 and the guard short and broad (fig. 17). 



Color pale reddish salmon, deepest anteriorly, tentacles flesh color. 



This species has been taken only on the piles of the New York Yacht 

 Club wharf in Vineyard Haven, where it occurs sparingly below low 

 water among Cynthia and Amaroecium; lives in small mud tubes and 

 breeds in early July.

SOME NEW AND LITTLE-KNOWN PERCOID FISHES. 



BY HENRY W. FOWLER. 



In this paper I give an annotated list of the more generalized percoid 

 fishes of special interest to be found in the collections of the Academy of 

 Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. Other papers dealing with remain- 

 ing families are expected to follow. 



Owing to the more general acceptance of the view among naturalists 

 that the first species under a genus be considered the type, I abandon 

 the process of elimination. Cases only apply where no type is desig- 

 nated or tautonomy is not inferred. Further I shall retain words 

 ■different only etymologically, though with a strict adherence to the 

 original orthography, even when erroneous, provided there is no 

 •evidence contrary. 



DULEIDiE. 



This name supersedes Kuhliidce, as Kuhlia Gill, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. 

 Phila., 1861, p. 48 (type Perca ciliata Cuvier specified = Centro'pomus 

 rupestris Lacepede), is superseded by Dules Cuvier, Regne Animal, 

 Ed. 2, II, 1829, p. 147 (type Centropomus rupestris Lacepede by first 

 species). 

 Dules marginatus boninensis subsp. nov. Fig. 1. 



Head 3; depth 2^; D. X, 11 ; A. Ill, 12; P. i, 13; V. I, 5; scales 50 in 

 lateral line to base of caudal, and several more on latter; 6 scales 

 obliquely back from origin of spinous dorsal to lateral line; about 13 

 scales between origin of spinous anal in a vertical series to lateral line; 

 width of head 2 in its length ; depth of head over posterior margin of 

 pupil about 1^; mandible 2^; fifth dorsal spine If; first dorsal ray l^-f;

 2|-; pectoral H; ventral If; ventral spine 2^; snout 4 in head measured 

 from tip of upper jaw; eye 3; maxillary 2f ; interorbital space 3|-. 



Body compressed, rather deep, lower profile a little more evenly 

 convex than upper, and greatest depth falling about midway in post- 

 ventral region. Back but slightly elevated, and with but a slight keel 

 & short distance in front of spinous dorsal, otherwise edges of body 

 rounded. Caudal peduncle compressed, its least depth about 1^ in 

 its length.

rather truncate in front. Eye rather large, rounded, high and anterior, 

 or posterior margin of pupil about midway in length of head. Mouth 

 inclined, moderate, opening superiorly, and with mandible protruding 

 in front. Maxillary narrow, free for about half its length, and its 

 distal expansion about f diameter of pupil. Teeth in jaws rather 

 small, in bands. Vomer and palatines with patches of minute teeth. 

 Tongue rather narrow, edentulous, pointed, and free in front. Buccal 

 membranes rather narrow. Nostrils close together, superolateral, 

 and much nearer front of eye than tip of snout. Interorbital space a 

 little broad, slightly convex, and with frontal ridges little prominent. 

 Margin of preorbital dentate. Lower margin of preopercle finely 

 dentate, and posterior margin entire. Opercle with 2 fiat backwardly 

 directed pointed spines, well separated, and lower larger. Supra- 

 scapula with several rather coarse serratures. 



Gill-opening extending forward about opposite front margin of 

 orbit. Gill-rakers 10 + 21, lanceolate, slender, finely asperous inside, 

 and longest about ^ of orbit. Gill-filaments a trifle less than diameter 

 of pupil. Isthmus narrowly compressed, and with a median groove. 



Scales finely ctenoid, above lateral line in series parallel with its 

 course, below in horizontal series, along bases of vertical fins small and

crowded, and in about 4 series on cheek. Lateral line of simple tubes, 

 and concurrent with dorsal profile. 



Origin of spinous dorsal behind that of ventral, spines graduated 

 from fifth, though fourth and sixth subequal, and margin of fin deeply- 

 notched. Last dorsal spine longer than second, though shorter than 

 third. Rayed dorsal begins about midway between origin of pectoral 

 and base of caudal, highest from first ray, though without lobe. Origin 

 of spinous anal falling about opposite origin of rayed dorsal, third 

 spine longest, and rayed fin similar to rayed dorsal. Caudal deeply 

 emarginate, lobes pointed. Pectoral short, reaching about f of space 

 to anal. Ventral inserted behind origin of pectoral, and reaching a 

 little over |- of space to origin of spinous anal. 



Color in alcohol pale brown, back slightly leaden, and lower surface 

 paler. Fins all plain pale brownish, margins of dorsals, and caudal 

 posteriorly, slightly dusky. Iris brassy-yellow. 



Length 5^ inches. 



Type, No. 11,556, A. N. S. P. Bonin Islands, between lat. 26° 30' 

 and 27° 44' N. and long. 140° and 143° E., in the North Pacific. Smith- 

 sonian Institution (No. 347). 



This form is apparently closely related to Dules marginatus Cuvier. 

 It differs from Tahiti examples of that species, however, in having 

 more scales in the lateral line. In this respect it agrees with Hawaiian 

 and Tahiti examples of Dules mato Lesson, though the latter differs 

 principally in having more gill-rakers. Examples of Dules rupestris 

 (Lacepede) from Samoa and Tahiti have the caudal but slightly emar- 

 ginate. 



(Named for the Bonin Islands.) 



BOULENGERINA subgen. nov. 

 Type Dules mato Lesson. 



Gill-rakers more numerous than in subgenus Dules. Boulengerina 

 has 24 to 28 on the lower part of the first arch, while Dules has 16 to 20. 



The specific name of the typical species dates from Dules mato 

 Lesson, Voij. Aut. Mond. Coquille, ZooL, III, 1830 (March 22, 1828), 

 p. 223, thus having priority over Dules malo Valenciennes, Hist. Nat. 

 Poiss., VII, 1831, p. 360. Kuhlia malo now in use must thus give 

 way to Dules mato. 



(Named for Dr. George A. Boulenger, of the British Museum, well 

 known among naturalists for many excellent works relative to the 

 lower vertebrates.)

MICROPTERIDu^. 



This name supersedes Centrarchidce as Centrarchus Cuvier, Hist. Nat. 

 Poiss., Ill, 1829, p. 62 (type Cychla cenea Le Sueur by first species = 

 Bodianus riipestris Rafinesque), and is therefore a synonym of Am- 

 bloplites Rafinesque. This leaves Eucentrarchus Gill, Amer. Journ. 

 Sci. Art., XXXVn, 1864, p. 93 (type Labrus irideus Lacepede = 

 Lahrus macropterus Lacepede) as the proper name for the round bass, 

 with the subfamily name changed from Centrarchince to Eucentrar chinos. 

 Therefore as Micropterus Lacepede is the oldest genus in this family 

 the above name may be framed for it. 



I have also examined Elassoma zonatum Jordan. Elassotna probably 

 represents a distinct family, as has been contended.

Apomotis is retained generically as the median posterior partition of 

 the air-vessel is only slightly developed, while in the species of Lepomis 

 examined it is usually well developed forwards.

A single example labeled "Roanoke River, Va., E. D. Cope," No.

 Journ. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., VI, 1866-69 (December, 1868), pp. 223, 

 224. It would agree in length if the caudal were not included, though 

 the measurements of the depth of the body at the origin of the soft 

 dorsal and at the base of the fifth ray of this fin do not. 



Pomotis soils Valenciennes, Hist. Nat. Poiss., VII, 1831, p. 352, is 

 apparently a composite species based on examples from Lake Pon- 

 chartrain, La., and Philadelphia, Pa. Primarily it seems to be re- 

 stricted to the Louisianan form, as Dr. Jordan examined the types 

 from Philadelphia and pronounced them as probably identical with 

 Eupomotis gibbosus. Drs. Jordan and Evermann, in Bull. U. S. Nat. 

 Mus., No. 47, I, 1896, p. 1001, place the Louisianan fish as a distinct 

 subspecies of L. auritus, stating that it has larger cheek scales, about 5 

 or 6 series, and a large dusky blotch on the last dorsal rays. Bollman, 

 in Rep. U. S. F. Com., 1888 (1892), p. 573, includes Lepomis my stacalis 

 Cope as a synonym, and is followed by others, though from my own 

 examination of the types of this latter it is found to be identical with 

 Lepomis palladus Mitchill. That the Florida form is not appreciably 

 different upon comparison of alcoholic examples of L. auritus from 

 Bayport, Fla. (E. D. Cope); South Carolina (Dr. J. E. Holbrook); 

 Catawba and Yadkin Rivers, N. C. (E. D. Cope) ; Lake George, N. Y. 

 (W. S. Vaux), I am satisfied. The original account of Pomotis solis 

 is hardly complete enough for certainty of identification.

This is a most variable species, both in color and structure, especially 

 with reference to the opercular flap. It is possible that Lepomis 

 occidentalis Meek, Field Col. Mus. Pub. 65, Chicago, III, No. 6, 1902, 

 p. 118, PI. 29, and L. haplognathus Cope may exhibit characters in 

 color to render them distinct races of L. megalotis. Certainly L. 

 haplognathus, judged from the alcoholic types, cannot be distinguished

Dr. Jordan examined Pomotis holbroockii Valenciennes in the Paris 

 Museum, and expressed the opinion that it is identical with P. speciosus 

 Holbrook. As the original account of the former is imperfect I accept 

 this view provisionally. The differences between Holbrook 's figure 

 and the examples before me are certainly not specific. The pectoral 

 of the former is but little shorter than the head. The specific name 

 is here adopted from the original.

MOLLUSC A OF THE OZARKIAN FAUNA. 



BY H. A, PILSBRY AND JAMES H. FERRISS. 



In the midst of the valley of the greatest river of the continent the 

 Ozark Mountains stand above the plain. On the east and south they 

 are bordered by lowlands scarcely a hundred feet above sea level, and 

 westward the great plains stretch to the foothills of the Rockies. The 

 Ozarks rise to no considerable height, the highest point, Magazine 

 Mountain, in Logan Co., Ark., attaining to 2,823 feet; but the rough 

 topography, in strong contrast with that of surrounding regions, 

 affords conditions favoring the evolution of special forms, species or 

 races, adapted to these conditions. Many of these forms have prob- 

 ably been evolved just where we now find them, and where they are in 

 a measure isolated by the absence or rarity of similar haunts in the 

 lower and more level country surrounding the mountainous area. 



Some aquatic forms, Unionidce and Pleuroceratidce, are also peculiar 

 to the Ozark region, though in the main Mississippian species rule. 



During the greater part of March and April, 1903, the authors col- 

 lected at numerous places in the western Ozarks, in southwestern Mis- 

 souri, western Arkansas, and Indian Territory, the localities selected 

 being supplemental to those worked by Mr. Ferriss in 1900 and 1901. 

 The results of our work are herein dealt with. 



I. Faunal Relations of the Ozark Region. 



The Alleghanian (= Transition of Merriam), Carolinian (= humid 

 Upper Austral) and Austroriparian ( = humid Lower Austral) zones as 

 mapped by Dr. Merriam,^ in eastern North America, are probably 

 reflected as clearly in land molluscan distribution as in that of verte- 

 brates and plants, though of course there is broad overlapping of 

 faunas, and the smaller details of the zonal limits remain to be deter- 

 mined by diligent local work. In the Northern States, this local 

 amplification may well be based upon Dr. Merriam's map; but in the 

 Southern Appalachian system some significant discrepancies appear 

 when the land moUusks are compared with vertebrate distribution.

 partment of Agriculture, Division of Biological Survey, 1898. 




530 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



The Boreal (Canadian) areas mapped by Merriam in Kentucky, 

 Tennessee and North Carolina have for mollusca no faunal connection 

 with or resemblance to the Canadian zone fauna of the northern 

 mountains and Canada. There is no evidence that the northern fauna 

 invaded these heights during the Ice Age, but much evidence to the 

 contrary.^ Had such an incursion taken place, it seems hardly con- 

 ceivable that no Vitrina, Pupilla, Vertigo or northern Zonitidm should 

 remain to tell the tale. A certain ill-defined zonal distribution depend- 

 ent on elevation may be traced, the mountain tops having a poorer 

 fauna than the lower levels, with dwarfed races of some species and a 

 few special species ; but the zoological affinities of the forms are in the 

 main with those of the lower coves, not with snails of higher latitudes. 



This illustrates what has been recognized by a few zoologists work- 

 ing in other departments, that transcontinental "life-zones" have no 

 necessary connection with the larger facts of faunal distribution, but 

 define secondary divisions, parallel, so to speak, all over the world. 

 For instance equal zones in the southern Alleghanies and the Rocky 

 Mountains might be spoken of as " physically homologous, ' ' but not 

 faunally so. 



In eastern North America we have, leaving the Floridian tropical 

 element out of the account, two faunas of inland mollusca, developed 

 in diverse areas: (1) the Boreal fauna, consisting of Holarctic species 

 or genera, such as Vitrina, Zonitoides, Enconulus, Acanthinula, Val- 

 lonia, Pupilla, Punctum, Sphyradium, Lymn(ea, etc., which apparently 

 had their rise in the north, and (2) the Appalachian fauna, consisting 

 of forms characteristic of the eastern United States, such as the 

 Mesodon, Triodopsis and Stenotrema groups, Omphalina, Vitrini- 

 zonites, Paravitrea, Gastrodonta, the alternata group of Pyramidula, 

 Helicodiscus, etc. From what we know of the Pliocene land shells, 

 and those of the interglacial and post-glacial Loess, it is clear that these 

 faunas must have been already as distinct at the close of the Pliocene 

 as at present; and in the case of the Appalachian fauna, we have 

 every reason to believe that its ancestors occupied eastern North 

 America during tertiary time, and how much farther back no man can 

 say.^ 



* See in this connection, Pilsbry, Mollusca of the Great Smoky Mountains, 

 Proc A. N. S. Phila., 1900, pp. 110-150, and Walker and Pilsbry, Mollusca of the 

 Mt. Mitchell Region, Proc. A. N. S. Phila., 1902, pp. 413-442. 



" The boreal and southern elements in the east American fauna were fully 

 recognized by Mr. W. G. Binney many years ago. Cf. also Charles C. Adams, 

 Southeastern United States as a centre of geographical distribution of flora and 

 fauna, Biological Bulletin III, pp. 115-131, 1902. 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 531 



From the investigations made by the authors and their friends, it is 

 obvious that there was in the East no extensive glacial recession 

 of the snail fauna southward beyond the border of the ice sheet. It 

 seems likely that the northern fauna of Appalachian origin was largely 

 wiped out, and the survivors crowded with the boreal forms in a band 

 along the States bordering the glaciated area. This comparatively 

 recent concentration of the snail population southward gives at first the 

 impression that the radiation of this element of our fauna was from 

 the southeast, yet during the mild tertiary period favorable condi- 

 tions certainly existed much farther north than at present, and 

 there seems no more reason to postulate a southeastern than a north- 

 eastern tertiary radiation. 



In the more elevated Rocky Mountain region there was obviously a 

 more extensive glacial recession. Boreal genera and species were 

 pushed at least as far as the Mexican boundary, where they still sur- 

 vive at considerable altitudes. 



The Appalachian types of land snails now extend over all of the Alle- 

 ghanian, Carolinian and Austroriparian zones ; but within this area we 

 must recognize several strongly individualized faunas characterizing 

 mountainous tracts. These are as follows : 



I. The Austro-Appalachian faima, comprising the eastern division of 

 the Appalachian Mountains east of the valley of East Tennessee chiefly 

 in North Carolina, south to Georgia. It is bounded on the north in 

 Virginia and West Virginia by an Alleghanian zone fauna on the high- 

 est ridges and a normal Carolinian at lower levels. The Austro- 

 Appalachian fauna has been explored by Dr. Rugel, Mrs. George 

 Andrews, Mr. Wetherby, Messrs. Walker, Sargent, Clapp, and the 

 present authors. It is mapped as Transition and Boreal in Dr. 

 Merriam's Life Zone map of 1897. 



II. The Cumberlandian fauna, including the western division of the 

 Appalachian Mountain system in Kentucky, Tennessee and northern 

 Alabama. The limits of this fauna extend southwestward beyond the 

 nucleus plotted as Transition in Merriam's map. Our knowledge of 

 this fauna is due to Lea, Binney, Bland, Wetherby, Harper and others. 

 It has been neglected by the present generation of conchologists, but 

 ■careful collections by Mr. and Mrs. H. H. Smith are now in progress 

 on its southern border (Alabama). 



III. The Ozarkian fauna, limited to the Ozark uplift, chiefly in 

 Arkansas, but extending into adjacent States north and west. It is 

 largely mapped as humid Upper Austral ( = Carolinian) by Merriam. 



These three faunas possess but few species in common, aside from 




532 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



those widespread forms of the whole CaroHnian zone, yet they have a 

 similar facies, owing to the rich development of Stenotrema and toothed 

 Zonitidce, the relative scarcity of Pupillidce, etc. It may be that the 

 resemblances are due to parallelism in evolution of the faunas from a 

 common source, yet the possibility may be entertained that the 

 Mississippi embayment, which isolates the Ozark uplift, was crossed 

 by a ridge, permitting rock-living snails to emigrate west from the 

 Cumberland plateau, at some period in tertiary time. This is a geo- 

 logical question aside from our present purpose.^ There is no mention- 

 able trace of Boreal zone elements in any of the three southern moun- 

 tain faunas ; and no ground exists in the molluscan fauna, for mapping 

 even the highest peaks as Canadian or Alleghanian. 



The Ozarkian fauna is thus one of several mountain faunas of com- 

 mon origin, all traceable to the Appalachian tertiary radiation. The 

 limits of this fauna can be mapped only after much more field investi- 

 gation, but roughly it includes the broken country of southern Mis- 

 souri, a small area in southeastern Kansas, the hilly eastern part of 

 Indian Territory, and the greater part of Arkansas, east as far pos- 

 sibly as the 500-feet contour line; but data are absolutely lacking for 

 the definition of its eastern boundary in Arkansas. We know that on 

 the opposite shore of the Mississippi there is no trace of Ozarkian 

 forms. Possibly the upland region of northwestern Louisiana should 

 be added. 



On the northwest, north, and northeast of the Ozark area the wide- 

 spread Carolinian species rule; on the southeast and south the 

 Austroriparian, and on the southwest the uttermost waves of Lower 

 Sonoran life ripple against the rising Ozark mass. The several elements 

 of the fauna are here listed. 



1. Species and subspecies confined to the Ozark fauna: 



Polygyra dorfeuilliana? Polygyra j. deltoidea. 

 d. sampsoni. j. simpsoni. 



d. percostata. labrosa. 



d. perstriata. fraterna imperforata. 



jacksoni. pilshryi. 



* Dr. D. S. Jordan writes: "Streams of the Ozark Mountains similar in char- 

 acter to the rivers of East Tennessee have an essentially similar fish fauna, 

 although between the Ozarks and the Cumberland range lies an area of lowland 

 bayous into which such fishes are never known to penetrate." (Science Sketches). 

 He suggests that the time of mingUng across the lowlands may have been when 

 the intervening region had a colder climate. 



" This species spreads southward as far as Galveston, etc., but it is listed here 

 because it is an abundant Ozarkian form, and has three races confined to that

About 36 per cent, of the total number of land snails listed are thus 

 peculiar to the Ozark fauna; but when its boundaries come to be more 

 exactly defined, and the finger-like extensions of the Austroriparian 

 and Sonoran areas along the river bottoms are eliminated, the propor- 

 tion of special forms will probably be increased.

but yet, except at Galveston, where it may be imported, it seems to be- 

 absent from the very wide and low Gulf border.

 more evolved or accelerated race than typical dorfeuilliana. It occu-

pies the northern central portions of the area, while the less evolved 

 typical form is peripheral. There is, however, no line to be drawn 

 between them, as in many places both forms and the intergrades 

 occur together, and in the Choctaw Nation especially, most specimens 

 are intermediate in size of the umbilicus. 



In 1903 we took the species at eleven localities in Missouri, Arkansas 

 and Indian Territory. Some of the specimens from the bluff along 

 Grand River at Wyandotte, near the northeast angle of Indian Terri- 

 tory, are the largest I have seen, and also the most extreme of the 

 sampsoni form, diameter 8 to 9.3 mm. (PI. XX, figs. 17, 18, 19). Those 

 from Limestone Gap, Indian Territory, and Magazine ]\It., Ark., are 

 intermediate in characters. At Mammoth Spring, Fulton Co., north- 

 east Arkansas, only typical dorfeuilliana was taken, the shells being 

 small, 6.7 mm. diam. (PI. XX, fig. 12). This is exactly the size given 

 by Lea for the type, .3 inch. 



In originally describing this species. Dr. Lea gave the locality as 

 "Ohio, Mr. Dorfeuille, Cincinnati," Mr. W. G. Binney states that 

 ■' ' Mr. J. G. Anthony obtained from ]\Ir. Dorfeuille some facts concern- 

 ing the original discovery of this species, which prove beyond all doubt 

 that it was accidentally brought from Kentucky." It is on the 

 strength of this that he reports it from "Kentucky, opposite Cin- 

 cinnati." Binney also records dorfeuilliana from "Coosa River, Ala- 

 bama. ' ' 



A somewhat extensive correspondence with active collectors has 

 failed to bring out any definite locality for dorfeuilliana in Kentucky, 

 Tennessee or Alabama. Inquiry among Cincinnati conchologists has 

 elicited no further confirmation of Mr. Dorfeuille's Kentucky record. 

 Mr. Bryant Walker wTites: "There are no P. dorfeuilliana from east of 

 the Mississippi, so far as I can find, in the Wetherby collection. I 

 have two specimens labelled 'Ky.' sent me years ago by Anthony, 

 •and one from the Lathrop collection from ' Wn. Tennessee.' " 



Dr. W. H. Dall, of the U. S. National Museum, under date of October 

 21, 1905, writes: "I have looked over our series of dorfeuilliana Lea. 

 One, marked by Lea 'type,^ has the locality 'Cincinnati,' but the 

 label records no collector's name, but the original description credits 

 it to Dorfeuille. There is also a fragment from Florida named by 

 Binney dorfeuilliana, but which in my opinion is a fragment of avara. 

 The first is No. 116,779, the other 47,318. We do not have it from 

 Alabama. All our series are from Indian Territory, Arkansas, Louisi- 

 ■ana, Texas. I feel quite confident the Ohio or Kentucky locality is 

 ■erroneous." 




538 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



Mrs. George Andrews informs us that no specimens from east of the 

 Mississippi have come to her knowledge aside from the records in Mr. 

 Binney's work, already alluded to. 



It is our experience that in the trans-Mississippian region where P. 

 dorfeuilliana occurs it is a common snail, readily found in all suitable 

 stations, and often in considerable quantity. It is not one of the 

 snails occurring only in restricted localities and requiring special search 

 to find. It seems therefore doubtful whether its range really extends 

 east of the Mississippi at all; and until some definite cis-Mississippian 

 locality for it is put on record, we are disposed to erase Ohio, Kentucky, 

 Tennessee and Alabama from the ascertained range of the species. 



The variety percostata Pils.^** (PI. XX, fig. 23) was based on 

 specimens from the Red River in southwest Arkansas, in which the 

 riblets of the upper surface continue over the base, which is strongly 

 and coarsely rib-striate. The sculpture, however, varies a good deal, 

 even in the original lot of several hundred specimens, most of which 

 are as smooth as the ordinary form of dorfeuilliana. The umbilicus, 

 while variable in width, is never so wide as in typical sampsoni. The 

 diameter is from 7 to 9 mm. 



We hesitate now to treat P. d. percostata as a subspecies, yet the 

 tendency in this local race to produce a sculptured base is not present 

 in a great number of other colonies of dorfeuilliana which have been 

 studied in thousands of specimens. 



P. d. perstriata n. subsp. PI. XX, figs. 24 (type), 20, 21, 22. 



Another incipient race of P. dorfeuilliana from Tushkahoma and 

 Poteau, Indian Territory, is open below like P. d. sampsoni, but the 

 base is finely and densely striate. In a large series collected the 

 sculpture varies but little. 



Other specimens from Mena, Ark. (PI. XX, figs. 20-22) are smaller, 

 and vary to forms with less distinctly striate base. 



Polygyra jaoksoni (Bland). PI. XX, figs. 1-5. 



The axis in this species is distinctly perforate at all stages of growth. 

 The upper lip-tooth is deeply placed and very oblique. Viewed from 

 the inside, the spire and parietal wall removed, it is seen to be 

 a narrow oblique lamina. There is no tubercle on the columella inside, 

 at least in the specimens I have opened. The diameter varies ordi- 

 narily from 6.5 to 7.5 mm. 



The type locality is Fort Gibson, I. T. We collected it copiously ^in

 mens from Springfield, Mo., are also small, 6.6 to 7 mm. diam. 



The localities now known for P. jacksoni follow : 



Southwestern Missouri: Camden Co. ; " Dade Co. ; " Ash Grove and 

 Springfield, Green Co. ; Jasper Co. ; Barry Co. ; " Macdonald Co." 



Arkansas: Eureka Springs, Carroll Co.; Washington Co.;" Rogers, 

 Benton Co.;^^ Porter and Chester, Crawford Co.; Van Buren Co.; 

 Frankhn Co.;" Sebastian Co.;" Blue Mt. Station and Petit Jean Mts., 

 Logan Co. ; Rich Mt. and Mena, Polk Co.^^ 



Indian Territory: Wyandotte, Wyandotte Nation; Fort Gibson, 

 Cherokee Nation; Poteau, Choctaw Nation.^^ 



The range of the species eastward in northern Arkansas remains to 

 be mapped. On the south its limit is apparently indicated with ap- 

 proximate accuracy, since the explorations of Mr. Ferriss in Arkansas 

 south of Polk county, and of both of us in the adjacent portions of 

 Indian Territory, failed to bring P. jacksoni to light.

Similar to P. jacksoni, except that the front edge of the parietal 

 callous is very thick and raised in an erect triangle. Alt. 3.5, diam. 8 

 mm., or smaller, diam. 7.5 mm. This form has been found only near 

 Fort Gibson, I. T. It has not before been illustrated. The figures are 

 from cotypes. 

 Polygyra jacksoni simpsoni n. subsp. PI. XX, figs. 8, 9, 10, 11. 



Larger than P. jacksoni and wholhj imperforate, though the axis is 

 hollow except in the last whorl, and the young shells therefore are 

 perforate. The aperture does not differ from that of P. jacksoni, but 

 there is a small tubercle within on the columella, seen upon breaking 

 into the base. Whorls 5^. Alt. 4.7, diam. 9.3 mm. The largest 

 specimen taken measures 9.5 mm. diam., the smallest 8.3 mm. 



The types were taken by us near Wyandotte, Wyandotte Nation, 

 in the northeast angle of Indian Territory, on the south bank of Grand 

 River, on a steep rocky bluff facing north. Mr. Simpson found this 

 form near Fort Gibson, I. T., and it may be what Sampson refers to as

a large form of P. jacksoni which he took on the bkiffs of the Arkansas 

 River at Van Buren, Crawford Co., and in Sebastian Co., Ark., but we 

 have not seen his specimens. 



At Wyandotte P. j. sirnpsoni alone is found on the bluff facing the 

 river, while the small typical jacksoni occurs in the dry stony woodland 

 at the summit of the bluff. In no case were the two forms found in 

 company. 



In 1900 Mr. Ferriss took a specimen of this variety at Mena, Polk Co., 

 Ark. (cf. Nautilus, XIV, p. 28, No. 72). 



Section Stenotrema Raf. 



Five species of this group are now known from the Ozark region: 

 P. stenotrema, P. labrosa, P. hlandiana, P. uncifera and several sub- 

 species of P. fraterna. The common Eastern P. hirsuta is not known 

 to enter the Ozarks. Mr. Sampson has recorded it from Sedalia, Mo., 

 a place well out of the Ozark fauna. P. jraterna, P. fraterna friersoni 

 .and P. f. alicicB are the only Stenotremes known to reach so far south- 

 west as Texas. 

 Polygyra stenotrema (' F^r.' Pfr.). 



Not a common snail in the Ozark region, so far as my experience 

 goes. It does not appear in Mr. Singley's Texas list, and I can find 

 no Missouri record, though from its presence at Hardy and Wyandotte 

 it may reasonably be expected over the State lines northward in both 

 Missouri and Kansas, as well as in the still unknown eastern part of 

 Arkansas. The following localities are represented by specimens 

 before us: 



Arkansas: Hardy, Sharp Co. (Ferriss) ; Mabelvale, Pulaski Co. 

 (C. W. Johnson); Petit Jean Mts., south of Hartford, Sebastian Co., 

 one dead shell (Pilsbry and Ferriss); spur of the Chastat Mts., about 6 

 miles south of Mena, Polk Co. (Ferriss) ; to which Mr. Sampson adds the 

 records Clark, Garland and Independence counties. 



Indian Territory: Wyandotte, Wyandotte Nation (Pilsbry and 

 Ferriss); Fort Gibson, in the Cherokee Nation (E. W. Hubbard). It 

 was also taken at the latter place by C. T. Simpson in 1888. 



Polygyra labrosa (Bland).

In 1903 we took this species at eight places in Missouri, Arkansas and 

 Indian Territory. It is quite abundant in most places, and varies but 

 slightly. The recorded range of P. labrosa east of the Mississippi in 

 Tennessee and Alabama (see Bland) rests solely upon data and speci-

mens furnished by our conchological forefathers, and no localities 

 more definite than the States mentioned have been given. It may be 

 that the eastern range claimed for this species and Polygyra dorfeuilli- 

 ana will prove to be without foundation in fact. In the West its 

 actually ascertained range is as foUows. Except where otherwise 

 stated, we have examined specimens from the localities mentioned : 



Missouri: Camden, Benton, Macdonald and Jasper counties;" 

 Springfield, Green Co. ;^^ Marble Cave near Galena, Stone Co. ; Seligman, 

 Barry Co.; Chadwick, Christian Co.; Cedar Gap, Wright Co." 



Arkansas: Mammoth Spring, Fulton Co.; Eureka Springs, Carroll 

 Co.; Rogers, Benton Co.; Van Buren^^ and Chester," Crawford Co.; 

 Washington,^^Franklin,^^Conway,^^Perry,^^and Independence^^ counties ; 

 Carrion Crow Mt.," Pope Co.; Hot Springs, Garland Co.; Washita 

 Springs,^^ Montgomery Co. ; Little Rock, Pulaski Co.; Magazine Mt,, 

 from the summit down, and Petit Jean Mts., Logan Co.; Poteau Mts., 

 south of Gwynn P. 0., Hartford Sta., Sebastian Co. 



Indian Territory: Sugar Loaf Mt., northwest of Gwynn P. 0., Ark. 



These localities are all in the hilly or mountainous country, chiefly 

 in central and western Arkansas, barely reaching over the State 

 border on the west, but extending some distance north into Missouri. 

 Nowhere does the species approach the lowlands of the Mississippi, so 

 far as we know at present; but we are still practically without data on 

 the land moUuscan fauna of eastern Arkansas. 



In his original description Bland mentioned four localities for P. 

 labrosa: Washita Springs and Hot Springs, Ark., Tennessee and Ala- 

 bama.' As neither was designated as typical, I would suggest that 

 Hot Springs, Garland Co., Ark., be selected as the type locality. It 

 has been collected there by Ferriss and others. 



There is a Helix labrosa of Wood, Index Testaceologicus, Suppl., p. 24, 

 pi. 8, fig. 69 (1828), which seems to be identical with Buliminus labiosus 

 Mull. 



P. (Stenotrema) edgariana might be supposed to inhabit Arkansas, 

 from the range given by Binney, Man. Amer. Land Shells, p. 275, but 

 it has not to my knowledge been found west of the Mississippi River, 

 and I doubt its occurrence there.

 Polygyra ynonodon Pils., Proc. A. N. S. Phila., 1900, p. 454. 



The southern range of typical P. monodon (Stenotremaleaioi authors) 

 seems to barely reach the Ozark region. Mr. F. A. Sampson records it 

 from Sedalia, Pettis Co., and Lamar, Barton Co., Mo., and Carroll, 

 Benton, Washington and Nevada counties. Ark.; also Neosho Co., 

 Kan. We have not ourselves seen Arkansas specimens. The following 

 subspecies replace P. monodon in the Southwest. 

 Polygyra fraterna friersoni Pils. 



Nautilus, XIII, p. 36 (1899); Proc. A. N. S. Phila., 1900, pp. 454-456. 



The shell is perforate or rarely closed, with 6^ whorls, a long fulcrum, 

 much longer than in P. f. imperforata, and no distinct notch at the 

 base of the columella. It is larger than P. f. alicice with more w^horls. 

 Numerous localities are given in Pilsbry's paper of 1900, to which the 

 following may be added' Fayette Co., Tex., and Nashville, Tenn., 

 in an open field, collected by A. G. Wetherby. This is the only locality 

 known east of the Mississippi River. The type locality is Frierson, La. 



Tolygyra fraterna (Say). 



It is somewhat peculiar that this form turns up in central Texas, 

 where it was taken by us at and near New Braunfels, and by Pilsbry at 

 Austin about 14 years ago. 

 Polygyra fraterna imperforata Pils. 



Proc. A. N. S. Phila., 1900, p. 455; 1903, p. 204. 

 We took this form on the Poteau Mts., south of Gwynn P. 0. (Hart- 

 ford Station), Sebastian Co., Ark. It is known also from Rich Mt. and 

 Mena, Polk Co., and Rocky Comfort, Little River Co., Ark. One 

 of the types from the last locality measures: alt. 7.7, diam. 10.5 mm. 

 to alt. 6.7, diam. 9 mm.

This form is typically small and elevated with very convex base, 



narrowly perforate axis, and 5^ to 6 whorls. The degree of elevation 



varies a good deal. The fulcrum is long and strongly notched above 



and below. The basal lip has a more or less strongly developed 



flange on its face, somewhat as in P. vultuosa, with a notch where it 



ends at the columella. Specimens of the type lot from Lake Charles, 



La., measure from 5x7 mm. to 5.7 x 7.8 mm.

We took this subspecies at the following localities: Monett, Barry- 

 Co., Mo.; Petit Jean Mts., Sebastian Co., Ark.; W3^andotte, Vinita, 

 Wister, South McAlester and Limestone Gap, Indian Territory. 



It is before us from three localities near the northeastern angle of 

 Texas: Gainesville, Cass Co. (Ragsdale); Wood Co. (R. Walton Coll.); 

 and DeKalb, Bowie Co. (Ferriss). 

 Polygyra obstricta occidentalis n. subsp. PI. XXII, figs. 30, 31, 32. 



Shell imperforate, slightly convex or nearly flat above, very convex 

 beneath ; similar to the more strongly carinate form of P. o. carolinensis, 

 but differing by the reduced teeth, those of the lip being very small 

 or vestigeal. Surface rib-striate, very minutely and densely papillose 

 between the riblets, not coarsely roughened as in obstricta. Whorls 4^ 

 to nearly 5, the last slightly descending in front.

This form is readily distinguishable by its dwarf stature and much 

 reduced lip-teeth. It is less acutely keeled than typical P. obstricta. 

 It is evidently what Mr. Sampson^** reports from Independence Co., 

 Ark. He found one specimen 20.5 mm. in diameter. 



P. obstricta carolinensis (Lea) extends westward in the South to 

 Grand Cane, De Soto Co., La., where it was collected by Mr. George 

 Williamson. Typical P. obstricta has not, I believe, been found west 

 of the Mississippi River.

This common snail was everywhere found in abundance; and since 

 in various places it has diverged to form local races or species, some 

 account of its variation may be timely. The type locality given by 

 Thomas Say is "lower Missouri" — that is, along the Missouri River 



« MoUusca of Arkansas, 1893, p. 186

within the State of Missouri. The type specimen measures alt. 6.2, 

 diam. 11.25 mm., with 5 whorls. The outer hp-tooth recedes a little 

 and is somewhat broad and rounded. The lower or basal tooth is 

 marginal, decidedly narrower than its fellow, and tubercular. The 

 notch between the two teeth is squarish and decidedly wider than deep. 

 See PI. XXII, fig. 1. 



In the stony ravines of the Ozark system at Chadwick, Mo., the 

 extensive series collected shows two forms, which we will call 1 and 2, 

 occurring in the proportion of 13 of form 1 to 38 of form 2, or one to 

 three. Form 1 (PI. XXII, figs. 2, 3) is nearly typical, but more frequently 

 the outer tooth is as small as the basal. The size varies from 5.2 x 10 

 to 7.3 X 12 mm. Form 2 is more solid, with the aperture more con- 

 tracted by larger teeth (PI. XXII, figs. 4-6). The two lip-teeth are 

 subequal, the basal one massive and broadly conic. The notch between 

 them is narrower than in the type, and as deep as it is wide. No speci- 

 mens reach the size of form No. 1, the extremes measuring 5x9 and 

 5.3 X 10 mm. Whether these two forms occurred together or in sepa- 

 rate colonies was not noted. 



The forms from other localities mentioned above vary from typical 

 to a condition of teeth intermediate between the two forms described. 

 Thus at Wyandotte, near the northeast angle of Indian Territory, 

 intermediate specimens occur in profusion (PL XXII, figs. 7, 8). 

 Among them was a mutation with the basal tooth obsolete, singularly 

 like P. smithi Clapp, except in the smaller size, diam. 10.4 mm. (fig. 9). 



On the northern side of the cliff defining the summit plateau of 

 Magazine Mountain it occiurs adjacent to the locality for P. edentata 

 magazinensis, though not actually associated with it. The specimens 

 here are mostly small, diam. 9.5 to 11.2 mm. On the drier and warm 

 side south of the summit plateau and in the valley south of Blue Moun- 

 tain Station, at the southern foot of the mountain, they are equally 

 small. The largest inflecta we found were taken in the Petit Jean 

 Mountains, about ten miles south of Magazine Mountain, where they 

 measured 12.3 to 13.8 mm. diam., and usually have the basal lip 

 calloused on the axial side of the basal tooth. The crest behind the 

 lip is also sharp and high.

The original specimens came from the summit of the Boston Mts., 

 at Winslow, Washington Co., Ark. Mr. Sampson found it also at 

 Porter, Crawford Co., and Ferriss took specimens at Chester, in the 

 same county. These localities afford specimens 12 to 14 mm. in diam. 



P. edentata differs from P. infiecta by the reduction of the two lip- 

 teeth to small and inconspicuous prominences, which however occupy 

 the positions of the prominent teeth in P. infiecta. The specimens 

 from Chester have a somewhat sharker, higher crest behind the lip 

 than the others. 

 Polygyra edentata magazinenois n. subsp. PI. XXII, figs. 12. 13, 14, 17, 18. 



Similar to P. edentata, but more contracted behind the lip, and with 

 the aperture less rounded, more triangular, the lower lip-tooth absent, 

 replaced by a low, wide prominence nearer to the columellar end of the 

 basal lip; scale-like cuticular processes well developed.

Polygyra hopetonensis (Shuttlw.). There is a set of four small speci- 

 mens apparently of this species, stated on the label to be from Fort 

 Gibson, I. T., received by A. D. Brown from E. W. Hubbard (No. 

 4,718 A. N. S. P.). This is so far from the well-known range of the 

 species (South CaroHna to Florida) that we mention the matter merely 

 to provoke further investigation. 

 Polygyra neglecta Ms. PL xxil, figs. 19, 20, 21. 

 Proc. A. N. S. Phila., 1903, 196. 



This species is now known from the following localities : 



Missouri: Springfield, Greene Co. (Wetherby) ; Chadwick, Christian 

 Co. (Ferriss and Pilsbry); near Marble Cave, not far from Galena, 

 Stone Co. (Coll. A. N. S. ) ; Seligman, Barry Co. (Ferriss). 



Kansas: Fort Scott, Bourbon Co. (F. A. Sampson) ; Erie, Neosho Co. 

 (Ferriss). 



Arkansas: Eureka Springs, Carroll Co. (Sampson) ; Rogers, Benton 

 Co. (Ferriss and Pilsbry); Mammoth Spring, Fulton Co. 



Indian Territory: Wyandotte, Wyandotte Nation (Pilsbry and 

 Ferriss). 



The range of the species indicated by these localities is a small area 

 in the northern and northwestern outliers of the Ozark system, about 

 200 miles in extent east and west, and about 120 miles north and south. 

 Its distribution northward in Missouri remains to be determined ; but 

 southward in Arkansas and Indian Territory it probably does not 

 range much farther, for it would hardly have escaped the notice of 

 Messrs. Sampson, Simpson, Ferriss and myself. 



* Several specimens from Mammoth Spring, Fulton Co., near the 

 northern boundary of Arkansas, are not quite typical, yet are decidedly 

 nearer to neglecta than to P. fraudulenta. Whether P. neglecta will stand 

 as a species or be reduced to the rank of a subspecies of P. fraudulenta 

 remains to be seen when good collections from the intermediate region 

 between its area and the Mississippi River can be examined.

 Mesodon kiowaensis Simpson var. arkansaensis Pils., Sampson, Moll, of 



Arkansas, p. 192. 



This is a solid, compact little "Mesodon," readily distinguished from 

 P. binneyana and from the small umbilicate form of P. indianorum by- 

 its wide spire and narrower last whorl, and by the very narrow expan- 

 sion of the internally thickened lip, which is without traces of teeth. 



It was originally found at Kiowa and Limestone Gap, I. T., two 

 stations (not towns) on the M. K. & T. R. R., where Mr. C. T. Simpson 

 collected in 1888. A single bleached shell was taken at Eufaula, I. T. 



In 1903 we worked a few days, April 9-11, at and near the Gap, and 

 on the adjacent Sandstone "Mountains" immediately eastward. 

 Helices were found chiefly under stones, together with copperheads 

 and rattlesnakes. We found P. kiowaensis very rare. Pilsbry got two 

 living ones, one of them not full grown, and four dead shells, three of 

 them more or less broken; Ferriss a few more. In all of them the 

 umbilicus is slightly narrower than in a cotype from Kiowa received 

 from Mr. Simpson (PI. XXI, fig. 20). 



On the dry southern slope of Magazine Mountain, Logan Co., Ark., 

 we found several dead and bleached shells similar to those from Lime- 

 stone Gap, only two entire and one broken, although a great deal of 

 time and labor was spent in the search. They occurred around and 

 under rocks (PI. XXI, fig. 13). 



The only other locality known is from near Hot Springs, Garland Co., 

 Ark., where Mr. Sampson in 1890 found the types of what was described 

 as var. arkansaensis (Pi. XXI, figs. 17, 18). These specimens are some- 

 what more robust than the types of kiowaensis, with the aperture 

 slightly larger and the umbilicus smaller. The specimens cohected by 

 us at Magazine Mountain and Limestone Gap demonstrate however 

 that the differences in the umbilicus and the shape of the mouth are 

 inconstant ; and we are now convinced that the varietal distinction is 

 untenable. The name arkansaensis should therefore be dropped. 



The scarcity of specimens at the three widely separated localities 

 known, while many intermediate localities have been carefully searched 

 for snails, shows P. kiowaensis to be one of the rarest of American Helices. 



Measurements of the specimens in Coll. A. N. S. follow, the dimen- 

 sions of aperture including the peristome:

 451, 1903, p. 201. Ferriss, Nautilus, XIV, pp. 26, 27, 28 (July, 1900). 



This beautiful species is closely related to P. indianorum, but is 

 readily distinguished from the typical form of that species by its open 

 umbilicus. It is equally easy to separate it from P. kiowaensis by the 

 larger aperture and comparatively narrower lip, which is less thickened 

 within and more reflexed. It is found only on the mountains,^^ so far 

 as our experience goes, and chiefly under large stones. It commonly 

 does not seem to be found in the same localities with P. indianorum, 

 either the one or the other occupying the ranges where we collected 

 in 1903. Ferriss however got both at Tushkahoma, I. T., a year or 

 two previously. It is now known from the following localities, all 

 of them south of the Arkansas River : 



Arkansas: Magazine Mt., Logan Co.; Petit Jean Mts., at the south 

 border of Logan Co., or the northwestern border of Yell Co. (Ferriss 

 and Pilsbry); Mena, Hatton's Gap and Rich Mt., Polk Co., and Gil- 

 ham and Horatio, Sevier Co. (Ferriss). 



Indian Territory: Sugar Loaf Mt. and Wister, Choctaw Nation 

 (Ferriss and Pilsbry); Tushkahoma (Ferriss); Poteau, 21-24 mm. 

 diam. (Ferriss). 



The specimens from Indian Territory are much smaller than those 

 from Arkansas, as may be seen from the following table, from which the 

 variation curves may readily be plotted. At Sugar Loaf Mt. the mode 

 is at 19.5 mm. and the largest specimen measures 23 mm. in diam., 

 while in Arkansas the mode is at 24 to 26 mm., and the largest speci- 

 men measures 28.2 mm. Curiously enough, at Tushkahoma, where the 

 largest P. indianorum were found, P. binneyana was small.

The locality ' ' Hardy, Sharp Co. ' ' given in the original description,

 there, we are not justified in omitting the locahty.

This species is still known from only a small area, the localities being 

 as follows: 



Arkansas: Poteau Mts., south of Hartford Station (Gwynn P. 0.), 

 Sebastian Co., on steep slopes under stones (Ferriss and Pilsbry), 

 April 5, 1903. 



Indian Territory: Tushkahoma, Standley and Poteau (Feiriss); 

 Limestone Gap (Simpson, Ferriss and Pilsbry). 



At Limestone Gap, on the line of the M. K. & T. R. R., we found P, 

 indianorum the commonest species, though living ones were hard to 

 get. The shells are smaller than at Tushkahoma, rarely over 22 mm. 

 diam., and about 60 per cent, of the w^hole number taken have the 

 umbilicus more or less open. There is a perfect series of gradations 

 from imperforate to as widely umbilicate as P. hinneyana; only three 

 shells of those found by Pilsbry were so open as this, and as they were 

 specially looked for, the actual proportion is probably less than 3 per 

 cent. 



These umbilicate shells, taken by themselves, might be considered 

 to be P. hinneyana were it not that they connect with imperforate 

 indianorum by an unbroken series of intergrades, and moreover even 

 those most like hinneyana have the columella perceptibly more widely 

 dilated. 



It will be seen by the table of measurements that all the specimens 

 from Limestone Gap plotted together would form a curve with two 

 nearly equal, strongly marked modes at the diameters 18 and 21 mm. 

 Separated into three series according to the condition of the umbilicus, 

 it is apparent that the imperforate (typical) form is larger than the 

 perforate, being from 18 to 22.5 mm. diameter, with the mode at 21 mm., 

 while the perforate form is from 16 to 21 mm., with the mode at 18 mm., 

 and the few really umhilicate specimens are 16.3 to 16.8 mm. in diam- 

 eter. This diminution of size correllated with a perforate or umbilicate 

 axis may indicate that the Limestone Gap race is either undeveloped or 

 retrogressive, assuming maturity while yet retaining a character of the 

 stage of youth in the unclosed axis ; the best nourished (largest) indi- 

 viduals attaining the normal closed umbilicus, while in those less favored 

 the closure is imperfect, and in only the most stunted snails is the umbili- 

 cus open. 



A somewhat different view would be that the Limestone Gap series 

 is in process of diverging to form two species, one larger and imper-

forate, the other smaller and umbilicate ; but as yet both characters 

 intergrade, and all the forms certainly occur together.

P. divesta has been reported from Bowling Green, Ky., by Miss S. F. 

 Price {Nautilus, XIV, 75), but I have not seen specimens from there and 

 am not sure of the identification. It has also been recorded from 

 "Vernon Co., Miss.," but there is no county of that name in the State. 

 No reliable record of its occurrence east of the Mississippi River exists. 



Throughout its range the species is very uniform in character, the 

 diameter ordinarily being from 17 to 21 mm. At Chadwick, where 

 nearly all land snails are dwarfed, the shells are remarkably small, a 

 series of 23 measuring as f oUows :

Several small series were taken in 1903 showing variations similar to 

 those discussed in a former paper. Aside from size the shells do not 

 vary much. The diameters are tabulated below for ten localities 

 where we took the species in 1903. 



Two large specimens from the north side of Magazine Mountain show a 

 parietal tooth. We do not remember seeing this tooth developed in 

 the trans-Mississippian race of albolabris hitherto. 



The largest specimens were taken on steep, damp and rocky northern 

 slopes, without reference to elevation. At Wyandotte, at an elevation of 

 about 900 feet above the sea, they Uve on the steep, rocky bluff facing the 

 river. At Magazine Mountain the series of large shells came from the 

 edges of the talus, just under the great sandstone cliff along the northern 

 side of the pleateau summit, at an elevation of about 2,700 feet; while 

 at an equal elevation on the dry south side, with the same sort of rock 

 and abundant cover, the shells were small, 25 mm. diam., and at the 

 base of the mountain still smaller, 24.5 mm. At Chadwick, where the 

 country rock is limestone, the individuals are small, 22 to 25 mm. 



The size of individuals in this species and area seems to be dependent 

 upon the abundance of cryptogamic food, and is therefore a function of

It is likely that the specimens from Seligman, Mo., which exhibited 

 two sizes without intermediate forms, commented upon in these 

 Proceedings for 1903, p. 198, were from two stations of diverse physical 

 features. 



There has also been recorded from Daingerfield, Morris Co., Tex., 

 a small form of alholahris, collected by Mr. W. L. McDaniel (J. A. 

 Singley, Contrib. to Nat. Hist, of Texas, Mollusca, p. 305; Fourth Ann. 

 Rep. Geol. Surv. of Texas, 1892). Mr. Singley also reports that a colony 

 of P. alholahris from North Carolina has been established by Mr.' 

 Askew at Tyler, Smith Co., Tex.

The shell is smaller than P. zaleta (Binn.), with the spire usually more 

 elevated, having somewhat the aspect of P. elevata; whorls 5^, more 

 slowly increasing, the last, in dorsal view, narrower. Aperture with a 

 larger parietal tooth; columellar prominence usually well developed.

While readily distinguishable from typical P. zaleta (or exoleta, as it 

 is commonly known), this form has much in common with the race of 

 northern Alabama, such as Mr. H. E. Sargent found at Woodville. In 

 Woodville shells also the parietal tooth is very large, and the size is 

 ordinarily that of typical zaleta, though occasional dwarf specimens 

 are not larger than the Ozark race. 



In fresh specimens of P. z. ozarkensis there is usually an appearance 

 of angulation at the periphery in front, though no actual angle exists. 

 The more elevated specimens might easily be mistaken for P. elevata, 

 which however differs by its columellar plate, the irregular shape of 

 the aperture and the more closely wound whorls. 



Typical P. zaleta we have seen from Black Hawk Hollow, Fort Madi- 

 son, Lee Co., Iowa (T. Van Hyning), but it has no extensive distribu- 

 tion in Iowa. Binney reports it from Missouri, but all the specimens 

 before us from that State are the variety ozarkensis. 



Binney specified no type locality for his Helix zaleta, merely stating 

 that it is " common in the States bordering on the Ohio river, and in 

 the western parts of Virginia and Pennsylvania." In order to have 

 a definite standard, Cincinnati, O., may be considered type locality, 

 specimens from that place agreeing well with his description and 

 figures. 



The following localities are now known for P. z. ozarkensis. Where 

 no collector is mentioned the shells were taken by the authors : 



Missouri: CuiTent River; Seligman, Barry Co.; Cedargap, Wright 

 Co.; Springfield, Green Co. (S. Weller); Chadwick, Christian Co. 



Arkansas: Eureka Springs (Sampson); Mammoth Spring, Fulton 

 Co. ; Harrison, Boone Co. (Stuart Weller) ; Rogers, Benton Co. ; Maga- 

 zine Mt., Blue Mt. Station and Petit Jean Mts., Logan Co.; Mablevale, 

 Pulaski Co. (C. W. Johnson); Little Rock; Poteau Mts., south of 

 Gwynn P. 0., Hartford Station, Sebastian Co.; Rich Mt. and Mena, 

 Polk Co.; Little River, Little River Co. In addition to these places 

 from which we have seen specimens, Mr. Sampson records P. exoleta 

 from Washington Co. 



Indian Territory: Sugar Loaf Mt., close to the western boundary of 

 Sebastian Co., Ark.; Wyandotte.

Measurements {diameter) of Polygyra zaleta ozarkensis. 



Of this species only two or three, at most, of the lots taken are suffi- 

 ciently large to be expected to yield normal curves. It would seem 

 however that there is no difference in size between shells from the 

 shady north side of the summit of INIagazine Mountain and those from its 

 dry southern slope. The Poteau Mountain and Petit Jean Mountain lots 

 are from northern exposures, but these mountains are rather dry. The 

 Sugar Loaf lot is from shady, leafy ravines, but not especially well 

 watered or damp. The snail however is not one which affects moist or 

 rocky situations. It lives preferably on slopes leaf -carpeted over a rich 

 humus, and rolls out of the leaves where one is raking for Omphalina. On 

 the north side of Magazine Mountain we took them on the leafy slope 

 just below the great rock-talus. 



From localities in Arkansas other than those tabulated but few (one 

 to three) specimens have been seen. They agree with those in the table 

 with three exceptions : At Rich Mountain Mr. Ferriss took two speci- 

 mens, 23.5 and 26 mm. in diam. ; in Little River Co. three taken measure 

 24.25 and 26.5 mm.; and two from Little Rock are large and heavy, 

 26 and 27.5 mm. These larger shells approach the eastern P. zaleta, 

 and indeed intergrade with that in size.

Very few records have been made of the existence of this species 

 west of the Mississippi River. The form from this region is in the 

 average smaller than Eastern shells. Some care is required to dis- 

 tinguish it from P. zaleta ozarkensis. A set of fine shells from Spring- 

 field, Green Co., southwestern Missouri (A. G. Wetherby collection), is in 

 the collection of Bryant Walker, who gives the following measurements : 



Alt 17 16.75 16 15.75 15 mm. 



Diam 21.5 20.25 19.75 20.5 20.25 " 



Sampson records P. elevata from Sedalia, Mo. We have not seen 

 specimens. One shell (Ferriss Coll.) was taken by Prof. Stuart Weller 

 near or at Harrison, Boone Co., Ark., measuring 17 x 22.5 mm. At 

 Hardy, Sharp Co., also in northern Arkansas, a series of five taken by 

 Mr. Ferriss measure:

Diam 215 20 20.5 21.5 22 " 



Whorls 6^ 6^ 6^ 6f 6^ 



Several of these are illustrated for comparison with P. z. ozarkensis,. 

 from which the greater number of whorls and the oblique, straightened 

 basal lip, usually with a tooth and notch at its outer end, distinguish 

 P. elevata. 



Other records from Arkansas are given by Mr. Sampson: Carroll,. 

 Crawford, Clark, Jackson Cos., and Augusta, Woodruff Co. (Call). He 

 remarks that it is "found on low ground or adjacent thereto." P. 

 elevata seems to be a species which has penetrated only the northern 

 edge of the Ozark region. The specimens reported from Fort Gibson, 

 I. T., should be re-examined, for they may prove to be P. z. ozarkensis^ 

 a form easily mistaken for P. elevata. 



P. elevata occurs as a pleistocene fossil in the Mississippi river bluffs 

 at Alton, 111., and Natchez, Miss.

The shell varies from imperforate to as widely perforate as G. 

 demissa; the periphery is well rounded in adults, and the basal and outer 

 walls of the aperture have a white callous lining, showing yellow outside 

 on the last third of the base, the rest of the shell being olivaceous. 

 Young shells usually have at some stage of growth an entering callous 

 lamella within the basal lip, at the position of the similar lamella in G. 

 gularis. Alt. 6.5, diam. 10 mm., whorls 6^. 



Type locality, Hot Springs, Garland Co., Ark. ; distribution, the 

 Ozark uplift in Arkansas and adjacent portions of Missouri and Indian 

 Territory. 



This form has been much misunderstood, and no fewer than five 

 names have been applied to it. It was not until the series collected 

 by us in 1903 was studied that the problem reached solution. In any 

 good series from one place, it is found that some shells possess the basal 

 lamina within the mouth, and that while these shells may be of various 

 sizes, they fall short of the maximum size of the toothless individuals found 

 with them. In the fully adult shells from any colony the lamina has 

 always been absorbed, so far as our experience goes. But specimens of 

 any size may also want the lamina; so that the lamellate stage may be 

 a transitory feature appearing sooner or later, or possibly it may not 

 be developed at all in some individuals. 



In one lot of 24 shells from Hot Springs, the largest one showing a 

 lamina is 8.5 mm. in diam., and the lamina is very low, hardly notice- 

 able. All of the 7 from this size down to the smallest (5.5 mm.) are 

 laminate, most strongly so in the youngest. None of the larger shells 

 (16 individuals, up to 10 mm. diam.) show a lamina. Fig, 2 repre- 

 sents a series of these shells, drawn to the same scale. 



The types of G. brittsi were specimens just past the laminate stage, 

 but still immature. 



In some colonies the laminate stage persists in somewhat larger 

 shells than above indicated. 



The size of the umbilical perforation varies, and we do not now think 

 that any racial distinction can well be based upon its variations. The

subspecies differs from typical Eastern G. demissa chiefly by the usual 

 development at some stage of the internal lamina, whereas we have never 

 seen this structure in any Eastern examples of the species. 



G. d. hrittsi is a more primitive form than G. demissa, and its chief 

 claim to renown is that it supplies the link between the toothed Gas- 

 trodonts, such as G. gularis, and those without teeth, G. acerra, ceri- 

 noidea, ligera and intertexta, with which demissa has hitherto been 

 associated. When young, G. d. hrittsi belongs to the dentate group, 

 but adults qualify to enter another class. *^ 



Like the Gastrodonts of the Appalachians, these Ozarkians vary 

 interminably in minor features with locality. At Magazine Mt., 

 Logan Co., Ark., we took it sparingly at all elevations. Also on the 

 Petit Jean Mts., south of Magazine, where they are 9 to 10 mm. in 

 diam., the young of 5 mm. being laminate. Also on the Poteau Mts., 

 south of Gwynn, Sebastian Co., and on Sugar Loaf Mt., in Indian 

 Territory, west of Gwynn, where those up to three-fourths grown are 

 laminate. 



At Chadwick, Christian Co., Mo., there is a large acerra-like form, 

 diam. 12 mm., with 6^ whorls and coarse sculpture. Only a few were 

 taken, none being of the laminate form. The identification of this lot 

 remains a little uncertain. 



The largest specimens we have seen are from Mena, Polk Co., Ark., 

 where they measure up to 8.5 x 14 mm., with 7 whorls. A young one, 

 7.5 mm. diam., is laminate, as are all those of smaller size. The 



" It may be noted that the ligera group was not included in Gastrodonta by 

 Binney and former authors. It was transferred to that genus by Pilsbry some 

 years ago on anatomic grounds. The conchologic connection is now estabUshed.

 Zonitoides minuscula alachuana (Dall). 



We took this in Logan Co., Ark., at Magazine Mountain, both on the

This form evidently stands close to V. petrophila, from which it 

 differs in the close sculpture of all the whorls and the larger size. The 

 maximum diameter of petrophila in the Ozarks, judging from over 30 

 specimens from various places, is 5^ mm., with 5^ whorls, the umbilicus 

 1.6 mm., contained 3^ times in the diameter. The largest Tennessee 

 specimen before us measures 5.6 mm., with 5^ whorls. Bland gives 

 the diameter of petrophila as 6 mm., with 5^ to 6 whorls.

 It was found by Ferriss in 1900 at Mena, Polk Co., near the western 

 border of the State {Nautilus, XIV, 30). 



The specimens from Magazine Mountain differ from the types from 

 East Tennessee in being brown in color, like Zonitoides arborea, while 

 the typical form is of a pale corneous tint. There are fully 5^ whorls. 

 V. p. pentadelphia has but 4^. This species belongs to the section 

 Glyphyalinia. The westward extension of this species is unexpected. 

 It will probably prove to be more widely spread in the Carolinian area 

 than is now known. 

 Omphalina fuliginosa (' Griff." Binn.). 



Small, globose specimens were taken on the northwestern confines of 

 the Ozark area at Wyandotte, I. T., and Rogers, Benton Co., and 

 Poteau Mountain, south of Hartford Station, Sebastian Co., Ark. 

 From the shells alone it would be difficult to decide upon the species, 

 but the soft anatomy is certainly nearer fuliginosa than friahilis. 



Omphalina fuliginosa ozarkensis n. subsp. 



The shell is light and thin, varying from dusky olive to olive-chestnut, 

 dusky near or at the lip. The surface is indistinctly marked with fine 

 spiral strise. Whorls 4h, the earlier ones invariably worn and white or 

 whitish. The mantle is pale gray, the branches of the vena cava black, 

 pulmonary vein and its branches not pigmented.

In the field this form is instantly recognizable by the black lines of 

 the pallial region, sharply defined against a pale ground, and readily 

 visible through the shell. In spirit this black pigment remains un- 

 changed.

 friabilis from several other counties, but as his list does not mention 

 0. fuliginosa it is almost certain that he included the two species in his 

 records. 



Texas: San Marcos, Hays Co., under dead leaves in the thicket along 

 a rill on the northeast side of San Marcos River, abundant. 



The Anatomical distinctions between 0. friabilis and fuliginosa will 

 be discussed elsewhere. The shells may be distinguished by the smaller 

 apex, narrower and more closely coiled early whorls of /ria6i7is, in which 

 moreover the apical whorls are smooth, polished, whitish-corneous and 

 umvorn, while the summit in southwestern fuliginosa is invariably 

 worn, the cuticle removed from the earlier whorls.

OBSEBVATIONS 

 MADE IN 1906 ON GLACIERS IN ALBERTA AND BRITISH COLUMBIA. 



BY GEORGE, JR. AND WILLIAM S. VAUX. 



At the present time the glaciers close to the line of the Canadian 

 Pacific Railway located in the western part of Alberta and the eastern 

 of British Columbia offer very convenient opportunities for study and 

 comparison. The most accessible examples are found on the western 

 slopes of the Selkirk and Rocky Mountain ranges, where they are fed by 

 the immense precipitation from the warm winds blowing eastward 

 from the Pacific Ocean. In common with almost all glaciers through- 

 out the world it is found that these are receding, and while the changes 

 between year and year are not great when the immense area of the 

 glacier is considered, in a decade or century sweeping differences must 

 be noted. 



That the general tendency for a great many years has been to recede 

 every glacier in this region points with unmistakable evidence. At no 

 very remote date the Illecillewaet and Asulkan Glaciers met and 

 flowed as one down the valley which is now shared in common 

 by their streams; while the beautiful Lake Louise, more than 225 

 feet deep at the centre, owes its existence to the dying Victoria Glacier 

 which now extends only to within one and one-half miles of the upper 

 edge and is year by year depositing in the lake masses of glacier mud , 

 ultimately to reduce it to a muskeg marsh. Thus at every turn the 

 life span of glacier, mountain and lake may be read, and the creating 

 and destroying forces seen at work on every hand. 



The much greater activity of glaciers located on the western slopes 

 of the mountains as compared with those on the eastern has already 

 been noted, and it may also be observed that the snowfall on the 

 higher ranges is greater than on the lower in corresponding positions, 

 even though the latter may lie farther to the west, and consequently 

 nearer to the origin of the moisture-bearing winds from the Pacific 

 Ocean. 



The amount of precipitation of snow on the several mountain slopes 

 and in the passes adjacent to the railway has always been a matter of 

 much interest to those concerned in protecting the roadbed during the 

 winter, and also to students of glacier and alpine phenomena, as by 

 comparisons made over a long series of years interesting data of cause

and effect may be obtained. Upon the completion of the railway 

 records were started, and have been kept with more or less regularity, 

 of the snowfall at three points near the summit of Roger's Pass on the 

 western slope of the Selkirk Range. While of course great variations 

 have taken place and inaccuracies have crept in, the summaries of 

 daily measurements are here given as they have been preserved for 

 three stations, "Cut Bank," at an elevation of about 4,000 feet, 

 Glacier House, 4,120 feet, and "No. 18 Shed," 4,300 feet.

 1905-1906 



Taking into account only the years in which records have been pre- 

 served gives the average snowfall at "Cut Bank," 19 feet 3 inches, 

 Glacier House, 30 feet 10 inches, and "No. 18 Shed," 33 feet 8 inches, 

 while the average yearly snowfall, taking into account all years ob- 

 served since the winter of 1886, gives 27 feet 11 inches. On the higher 

 slopes and the neve regions of the glaciers in the vicinity the snowball is 

 much greater, yet the above may be taken fairly as an average for the 

 elevation of Glacier House, 4,120 feet, or a little below the tongue of 

 the Illecillewaet Glacier. 



In the following pages no attempt will be made to describe the pecu- 

 liar phenomena of the several glaciers upon which measurements have 

 been made, but to briefly outline the observations made during 

 the last two weeks of July, 1906, together with sufficient description of 

 the work which has gone before to provide data for comparisons. 




570 proceedings of the academy of [dec, 



Illecillewaet Glacier. 

 Glacier House, British Columbia. 



Being the most accessible of any of this group, the Illecillewaet 

 Glacier has been observed yearly since 1898. Prior to that time, 

 beginning in 1887, the observations have been made with less regu- 

 larity.^ 



The work may be divided under three heads, each of which will be 

 treated separately as follows : 



Test Pictures. — These have been made each year, beginning 

 August 17, 1898, from the marked rock "W." From this point a 

 complete view of the tongue and lower glacier may be had, and of a part 

 of the icefall almost up to the limit of the dry glacier. The same 

 camera and lens being used and exactly the same position selected, the 

 pictures indicate very accurately the changes which have taken place 

 in any given interval. A careful study of these shows that in spite of 

 the continued recession of the tongue and a general shrinkage of the 

 ice at the edges, particularly at the left side where great masses have 

 broken away uncovering water-worn bedrock, the thickness of the ice 

 at the sky line is appreciably thicker than it was in 1898. This condi- 

 tion has been noted for a number of years, and time alone will prove 

 whether an advance will take place when the thicker mass reaches the 

 icefall and tongue. There is no doubt, however, that in all other par- 

 ticulars — breadth, depth and extension of tongue — the glacier is at 

 present from year to year decreasing. A comparison of the two test 

 pictures of 1902 and 1906, reproduced herewith, with that made in 1898 

 (compare Plate V, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1899) will show in 

 detail the changes which have taken place. 



'p Recession of Tongue. — As previously noted (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. 

 Phila., 1899, p. 124), the first accurate location of the tongue of the ice 

 is to be found in a long flat boulder not far from the moraine of 1887 

 (S. on the map), lettered by unknown hands, ''16 feet to nearest ice, 

 '90." With this rock as a basis the glacier showed a retreat after 

 eight years on"August 17, 1898, of 452 feet. 



From 1898 to the past summer (1906) the annual change has been 

 determined from a rock (marked "C." on map) lying in the centre of 

 the bed moraine and which on August 17, 1898, was 60 feet from the 

 tongue of the ice. The following table shows the recession each year 

 and the date on which the measurements were made. 



' ' ForTdetailed accounts of pre\aous investigations on this glacier see Proc. 

 Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1899, pp. 121 and .501, and 1901, p. 213.

July 24,1906 



It is interesting to note that while the recession between 1890 and 

 1898 showed an average of 56 feet per year, for the eight years from 

 1898 to 1906 this average has been but 33.3 feet per year, or about 

 three-fifths. It will also be observed, by reference to the map, that the 

 measurement on July 24, 1906, was not made to the point of greatest 

 extension in the ice. Should this point have been measured the course 

 would not have been in the same line as previous years, the tongue 

 having moved to the left, but the recession for the year ending in 1906 

 would have been 64 feet, instead of 84 feet as noted in the table. 



The change noted between any two years is not a good indication of 

 the amount of recession or advance which may have taken place, as 

 the local weather conditions, rainfall, and even the condition of the 

 crevasses above, all have a marked influence in determining changes, 

 and it is only when these are eliminated by including a longer interval 

 that the true amount of change may be determined. 



Flow of Glacier above Tongue. — In 1899, to determine the rate of 

 flow of the ice at a point about 1,300 feet above the tongue, eight plates 

 were laid out across the glacier. These were accurately placed by 

 means of a transit in a true line almost at right angles to the direction of 

 flow, and their change in position accurately determined after stated 

 intervals. The positions of these plates have been plotted on the 

 map, and the table on page 572 gives a summary of the changes that 

 have taken place at the times noted. 



With the exception of the comparisons made between July 31 and 

 September 5, 1899 (see first part of table, page 574), the motion indi- 

 cates the movement of the glacier over the period of approximately a 

 year, and thus includes both the summer flow which should be greater 

 and the winter flow which should be less than the averages given. 



Several of the 1899 plates have been lost from one cause or another.

while others have completed their journey and now rest on the bowlders 

 at the edge of the ice. In 1906 an entirely new set of six plates was 

 prepared, and on July 12 they were laid out on the exact line used in 

 1899 (see map). Some defects having been found in the first plates the 

 ones laid out this year were of different design. A lighter steel reduced 

 the weight by one-half without decreasing efficiency, while the pipe 

 caulk was dispensed with entirely, a hold in the ice being obtained 

 by turning the right edge up one-half inch, and the left edge 

 down a like amount. The plate was thus held in position on the ice 

 should it turn over. It is made up of but one piece, and may be nested 

 compactly for carrying. Steel one-eighth inch thick was used, 6 

 inches by 7 inches, which was left 6 inches square after the edging up 

 had been completed. A trial showed that the thinner plate, allowing 

 greater melting of the ice beneath, formed a pocket in which the plate 

 rested, almost entirely free from slipping even on the steeper slopes. 

 Each plate was marked "VAUX, 1906" in white on a red lead back- 

 ground. The plates laid out were numbered from 1 to 6, beginning 

 on the right side of the glacier. 



The aim of this investigation was to compare the yearly rate of flow 

 at the line laid out with the yearly changes in the position of the 

 tongue, and to determine the effect which a change in one would have 

 on the other. As the second series of plates have been in position but 

 a short time no yearly comparisons can be made, but the following 

 table, comparing the daily motion of the plates in the fall of 1899 

 (compare Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1899, p. 507) with the motion 

 of those in 1906, will give a ratio of the summer motion between the 

 two dates. The plates have been grouped according to their location 

 on the glacier, the numbers in the two instances bearing no relation to 

 each other. 



The great uncertainty of this work may be realized when it is noted 

 that in 1906 during twelve days the surface conditions of the glacier 

 changed completely. Crevasses opened, others closed, and plates 

 which when laid out were on comparatively level ice were found to be 

 in almost inaccessible positions, Avhich took long detours from the 

 main path to reach. 



The interval between the laying out and measuring of the plates 

 was one of unusual heat. Great freshets were reported all through the 

 district, every glacier stream was swollen to abnormal size, and evi- 

 dences of great surface melting were everj^here apparent. 



In addition to locating the position of the plates, a cross-section of 

 the surface of the glacier at this point was developed. A comparison

of this area with that similarly plotted in 1899 shows a marked shrink- 

 age in the surface of the ice at that point.

AsuLKAN Glacier. 

 Glacier House, British Columbia. 



This glacier, lying at the head of the Asulkan Valley, some three miles 

 from Glacier House in British Columbia, has been observed with more 

 or less regularity since 1899 (compare Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 

 1899, p. 504). At that time rocks were marked and the general aspect 

 of the tongue and moraines noted. Photographs have also been made 

 which show the yearly changes in extension, thickness and breadth. 



The work on this glacier in 1906 covered practically the same 

 ground as on the Illecillewaet, and may be similarly divided. 



Test Pictures. — An almost continuous record of photographs of the 

 lower section has been made since 1899 from a large flat rock several 

 hundred feet below the glacier which affords a view of all parts. A 

 comparison of these photographs taken over a series of years shows 

 smaller changes than in the cases of some of the neighboring glaciers, 

 but that they are of the same character — a general shrinkage and 

 reduction of section area (compare Plates XXV and XXVI with Plate 

 VI, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1899). 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 575 



Changes in the Tongue. — On the left side the Asulkan Glacier is 

 bearing a large amount of morainal material which is deposited at the 

 lower part of the left edge and upon the tongue. The right side is 

 comparatively free from moraine except stray erratics which are 

 borne on the surface of the ice and deposited at the edge. Several 

 small moraines on the bed moraine indicate that at one time the 

 amount of this material was much greater than at present. 



For several years the tongue has been deeply bedded in moraine and 

 was difficult to locate. During the period of slight advance which was 

 first noted in 1903 a steep moraine was pushed up at the tongue and the 

 stream forced to find an exit through a smaller moraine on the right. 

 The present year, however (1906), the tongue occupied almost exactly 

 the same position as in 1899, leaving a space between the ice and the 

 moraine which was formed during the glacier advance. A considerable 

 stream issues directly beneath the tongue and almost covering the 

 1899 test rock, has broken through the high unstable moraine. 



The following table shows the changes in the tongue as observed 

 since 1899.

The Flow of Glacier above Tongue. — For this work a line was selected 

 across the glacier about 1,250 feet above the tongue and as nearly as 

 possible at right angles to the line of flow. Owing to the comparatively 

 short distances and the ease of observation no base line was laid down 

 except as a check, and the positions of the plates from the points of 

 observation were determined by means of the stadia. The motion of 

 the plates on the ice was in every case measured with a horizontal 

 steel tape at right angles to the base line. Plates numbered 7 to 12, 

 similar to those used on the Illecillewaet Glacier, were laid out on July 

 13, 1906, and their motion determined on July 23. The following 

 table shows the total and average daily motion of the plates and of a very 

 large oblong bowlder resting on the top of the moraine on the left edge 

 of the glacier and advancing with it.

Table Showing Average Daily Motion of Plates on Asulkan Glacier 

 between July IS and July 23, 1906. 



Sketch Map of Tongue. — The accompanjang map of the glacier foot 

 has been compiled from a series of stadia measurements, sketches and 

 photographs. On it have been plotted the position of the tongue and 

 the outline of the ice as it existed on July 23, 1906. If question is 

 raised as to the accuracy of the stadia method for this class of work, it 

 may be noted that in every instance the motion of plates and recession 

 were determined from measurements with a standard tape, and it was 

 found that over rough ground and glacier surfaces work could be 

 greatly expedited by use of the stadia, with an error not so great as 

 would be encountered on the necessarily small scale of the plotting 

 map. 



Wenkchemna Glacier. 

 Valley of the Ten Peaks, Laggan, Alberta. 



In some respects this glacier presents the most unusual aspect of any 

 noted in the region. Of the piedmont type its neve receives snow 

 which falls and is blown across the Wenkchemna Group or ' ' The Ten 

 Peaks ' ' and falls into the couloirs and chimneys lying on the northern 

 slopes. At the lower levels a number of comparatively small glaciers 

 are formed, flowing almost due north across the southern half of the 

 Valley of the Ten Peaks. The valley bottom in places is covered with 

 an open forest of firs and spruces, the Lyell larch being found in abund- 

 ance at the upper (western) end where an elevation of over 7,000 feet 

 is reached. 



At the head of the valley several almost parallel lines of ancient 

 moraines were noted, and distinct traces of them could be followed 

 down the valley till they were finally lost in the stream-eroded bottom. 

 These moraines, and the very interesting one at the lower end of Moraine 

 Lake which has given it its existence and name, point clearly to the 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 577 



fact that the glacier at one time covered the entire bottom of the 

 valley, and that the medial moraines which are now noted between the 

 several sections of the glacier were at that time carried entirely on its 

 back down the valley and deposited far below, without leaving any trace 

 of the route which had been originally taken. 



It has been known for a number of years that some portions of the 

 Wenkchemna Glacier were advancing, or rather that from time to time 

 masses of moraine which had rested almost upon the limit of the ice 

 had been shot down upon and partly or completely covered living trees 

 of the forest, which in places comes directly up to the ice wall. A 

 comparison of photographs taken in previous years with the condi- 

 tions as they were found in July, 1906, indicated that at the points in 

 question no material advance of the ice could have taken place, and yet 

 at these very points there was evidence of masses of moraine being 

 projected on the ground below. The fresh rock was thrown beyond the 

 limit of the ice, which to all observation had not changed recently. 

 The base of the glacier close to the ground gave evidence of not having 

 changed for a number of years, but from the ice slope above masses of 

 rock were and had been precipitated over and beyond the older rocks 

 and upon the grass and trees. 



A careful consideration of these unusual conditions seemed to offer 

 but one satisfactory solution. The ice forming this glacier, or rather 

 composite glacier, is largely contained in a hollow or basin, from the 

 bottom of which drainage is provided to the lake below. The ice 

 extends above the edges of the basin, in many places covered deeply 

 with moraine. The pressure upon the ice from behind causes a slow 

 but steady motion of the upper strata towards the edges, which sets up a 

 shearing action of one layer of ice on that below. The result is that the 

 upper part of the moraine, very thin and unable to withstand the pres- 

 sure, is pushed outward by the ice till it falls over the edge of the lower 

 and more stable portions and upon the green grass or forest beyond the 

 limits of the basin. It is evident that this action is much more active 

 at certain points than at others, and an attempt was made to determine 

 whether the position of the edge had anything to do with it, without 

 satisfactory results. 



Wliatever may finally be determined as to the cause of change in tne 

 ice edge, a tramp over the glacier surface gave many evidences of great 

 and continued shrinkage. The moraines everywhere showed that 

 though they had been recently formed the ice was then many feet 

 thicker, and a series of very beautiful rock cones, which rested on the 

 solid ground but were surrounded by ice, bore silent witness to the 




578 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DCC.^ 



immense thickness of the ice in recent times compared with what is 

 noted at present. 



Victoria Glacier. 

 Lake Louise, Laggan, Alberta. 



Almost as accessible as the lUecillewaet, the Victoria Glacier has never 

 received the same careful study owing in large measure to the immense 

 moraines which bury the tongue and the almost impossible task of 

 finding permanent base and line ends. The great boulder marked in 

 1899, and which the next season had moved with the ice 147 feet, has 

 not since been measured, but the position of the ice on the northwest 

 side, referred to several large angular blocks of red quartzite, has been 

 repeatedly determined. 



During the summer of 1898 these blocks slipped from the ice and fell 

 to the moraine below. On July 29, 1899, they were 20 feet from the ice ; 

 on July 24, 1900, 26 feet, showing a change of 6 feet for the year; on 

 September 1, 1903, 76 feet 6 inches, or an average yearly shrinkage of 

 almost 17 feet, while on July 30, 1906, the distance was but 74 feet 

 7 inches, showing practically no change, as the early date of measiu^e- 

 ment in 1906 compared with 1903 would make considerable difference 

 in the total figures. 



Wapta or Yoho Glacier. 

 YoHO Valley, Near Field, British Columbia. 



This glacier, located at the head of the Yoho Valley, is a very long 

 day's trip from Field, the station on the railway. On August 17, 1901, 

 the position of the tongue was marked on a large mass of bedrock 

 which had been recently uncovered by the ice. The tongue at this 

 time was a narrow blade of ice somewhat to the left of the axis of the 

 glacier and lying in a long deep groove between parallel ledges of rock. 

 Three years later the change was measured on August 7, 1904, as 89 

 feet, or an average yearly recession of almost 30 feet. At this time 

 there were signs of great activity and marked shrinkage. 



On July 15, 1906, almost a month earlier in the season than on the 

 occasion of the previous visit, the glacier was again observed and the 

 distance measured as 76 feet 7 inches, or about 12^ feet less than in 

 1904. Allowing for the earlier date, it may be said that the tongue 

 is in the same position as two years ago. The general aspect of the 

 ce showed that it was shrinking and retreating, and this was particularly 




1906,] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 579 



the case on the right side where the main stream debouches from a 

 most beautiful ice arch. 



Horseshoe Glacier. 



Paradise Valley, Laggan, Alberta. 



Although no marks have been placed on this glacier it offers some 

 striking and unique points of interest. It is of the piedmont type and 

 owes its existence to the snow avalanches from Mounts Hungabee, 

 Ringrose, Lefroy and Mitre, to the north of which it lies. The tongue 

 and lower portions are deeply buried in moraine. While in common 

 with others there are indications of shrinkage and retreat, the protection 

 of moraine on the surfaces renders these changes very slow. An ex- 

 ceedingly interesting phenomenon was noticed at a point several 

 hundred feet above the tongue where a great sinuous canon has been 

 worn in the ice. The sides were perpendicular or overhanging, from 

 20 to 30 feet in depth, while the curves were 1,000 to 1,500 feet long. 

 In all there were not less than ten great bends, and through the bottom 

 a good-sized stream flowed. The walls exhibited very fine examples of 

 banding, while all the surfaces were fluted horizontally, apparently due 

 to the greater melting in summer than in winter. Should this be correct 

 the caiion has been at least twelve years in forming. 



From the foregoing data it is hard to draw more than the most 

 general conclusions. It may, however, be safely noted that in all the 

 glaciers observed there has been decided shrinkage and recession in the 

 past seven years. While changes in the position of the tongue may 

 have been small, the ice mass and sectional area are evidently much less. 

 On the other hand the average yearly recession was in 1906 less than 

 during a similar period five years before, the exception in the lUecille- 

 waet Glacier being probably due to unusual conditions. The trifling 

 advances in the Asulkan Glacier may be attributed to local causes and 

 have no particular significance, but the increased daily rate of flow of 

 the IlleciUewaet, coupled with a thickening of the ice at the sky line as 

 seen from the test rock, would seem to point to a period of greater 

 activity in the not very distant future.

The following reports were ordered to be printed : 



REPORT OF THE RECORDING SECRETARY. 



Sixteen meetings of the Academy were held during the past year, 

 with an average attendance of fifty-two. Communications, for the 

 most part illustrated with lantern views, were made by Henry Skinner, 

 George Vaux, Jr., William S. Ysmx, Jr., Stewardson Brown, Arthur 

 Erwin Brown, Witmer Stone, John W. Harshberger. William P. 

 Wilson, Edwin G. Conklin, Henry Leffman, Benjamin Sharp, George 

 Wood, Henry E. Wetherill, Harvey ^I. Watts, Mrs. Charles Schaeffer 

 and Miss Mary J. Holmes. But few of these were reported for publica- 

 tion in the Proceedings. 



Twenty-seven papers were presented for publication as follows: 

 Henry W. Fowler, 5; J. Percy Moore, 4; James A. G, Rehn, 3; James 

 A. G. Rehn and Morgan Hebard, 1; Henry A. Pilsbry, 2; Henry A. 

 Pilsbry and C. M. Cook, Jr., 1 ; Benjamin C. Tilghman, 1 ; E. A. Andrews, 

 1; Ralph V. Chamberlain, 1; N. M. Stevens and A. M. Boring, 1; 

 Burnett Smith, 1; Henry C. Oberholser, 1; J. F. McClendon, 1; R. J. 

 Lechmere Guppy, 1; N. E. Mclndoo, 1; W. S. Blatchley, 1; Nathan 

 Banks, 1. Three of these were returned to the authors, the others were 

 accepted for publication in the Proceedings, of which one number for 

 1905 and two for 1906 have been issued and distributed. 



Seven hundred and fifteen pages of the Proceedings have been pub- 

 lished, illustrated by fifteen plates. The Entomological Section has 

 published four hundred and four pages with fifteen plates of the 

 Entomological News and two hundred and forty-seven pages with 

 five plates of the Transactions of the American Entomological 

 Society (Entomological Section of the Academy). Two hundred and 

 seventy-two pages with thirty-four plates have been issued of the 

 Manual of Conchology. This makes a total of sixteen hundred 

 and thirty-eight pages and sixty-nine plates published during the year 

 under the auspices of the Academy. 



The President was appointed to represent the Academy at the cele- 

 bration by the American Philosophical Society of the two hundredth 

 anniversary of the birthda}- of Benjamin Franklin. 



A satisfactoiy design for the new Haydeii Memorial ]\Iedal has at 

 last been submitted and approved. The artist has been engaged on the 

 work since September, 1905. Whether the time that has elapsed 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 581 



has been due to the eccentricities of the artistic temperament or a 

 press of other engagements is not known, but it is believed that the 

 beauty of the result will compensate for the delay. The new medal 

 will certainly be a great improvement on the one awarded since 1890, 

 the portrait of Hayden on the obverse being much more accurate than 

 could have been hoped for from the photographs available, while the 

 design of the reverse, replacing the unsatisfactory view of the Grand 

 Canon, is gracefully emblematic. The die will, it is hoped, be promptly 

 engraved,so that the medal,so long due, may be conveyed to Dr.Walcott. 

 Mr. Fox has rendered effective assistance in the issue and distribu- 

 tion of the Proceedings.

The general condition of the Library has been further improved by 

 the binding of 2,010 volumes. It is hoped that in a year or so the 

 arrearages will have received such attention that the appropriations 

 for bindings may be largely decreased. 



In compliance with the action of the Council of the Academy, 1,318 

 volumes were sent to the California Academy of Sciences to assist in 

 repairing the loss inflicted by earthquake and fire on the 18th of last 

 April. The collection included a nearly complete set of the Proceed- 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 585 



JNGS and Journal of the Academy bound and, in common with the 

 other volumes, appropriately labelled so as to indicate the source and 

 object of the gift. A letter of acknowledgment recently received 

 conveys the assurance that the books will be an important assistance 

 to the California Academy, the members of which, in common with all 

 the people of San Francisco, displayed such superb courage and for- 

 titude under an almost overwhelming affliction. The boxes were sent 

 to California through the Smithsonian Institution. 



Many duplicates received from corresponding societies had for years 

 been accumulating in the Library of the Academy. After a selection 

 had been sent to the California Academy, the Library Committee and 

 the Council directed the return of the remainder to the publishing 

 societies, in the hope that a similar favor might be secured in the case 

 of duplicates of the Academy's publications. 



Parcels therefore have been sent through the International Bureau 

 of Exchange to 215 societies, each accompanied by the following 

 notice: "The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia returns 

 duplicates of publications received from corresponding societies, 

 and requests that duplicate numbers of its Journal and Proceed- 

 ings be returned, either by post or through the International 

 Bureau of Exchange." It is hoped that this action may result in an 

 addition to the stock of the earlier issues of the Academj^'s publications, 

 several of which are nearly out of print. 



Seventy-eight volumes and 256 pamphlets, pubUcations of the 

 Department of Agriculture, U. S. Geological Survey, Bureau of Educa- 

 tion, etc., have been returned to the Government Printing Office, in 

 compliance with the law. The greater number of these were dupli- 

 cates, but some were works not pertinent to the Academy's Library. 

 About thirty-seven volumes belonging to the latter class were given 

 to the Free Library of Philadelphia. 



Cards have been prepared to be placed in the spaces left by books 

 kept in the study rooms for use, thus in a measure remedying the incon- 

 venience arising from such retention. 



The necessity for additional room in some of the departments of 

 the Library becomes annually more pressing. In view of the possi- 

 bility of an increase of the Academy's building in the near future 

 certain of the additions are placed temporarily, not always in con- 

 formity with the system of classification, in the hope that the required 

 increase in the shelving capacity of the Library may be secured. 



Ten cases are still to be shelf-listed in the department of Journals 

 and Periodicals, although the work has continued during the year[^as 

 steadily as the time at the disposal of the Assistant would permit. 




586 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



Three hundred and thirty-nine lantern sHdes have been added to the 

 collection as a loan from the Ludwick Institute. These are dis- 

 tinguished in the catalogue by blue cards. 



The intelligence and reliability of my assistant, William J. Fox, in the 

 discharge of his duties, both in the Librarj- and in connection with the 

 publications of the Academy, are again gladly acknowledged.

Librarian. 



REPORT OF THE CURATORS. 



The collections in the care of the Curators are in excellent condition, 

 while much progress has been made during the year in their study and 

 classification. 



Early in the year work was begun upon the new concrete and steel 

 roof for the Library building, for which the Academy received an appro- 

 priation of S20,000 from the State of Pennsylvania, and by the begin- 

 ning of the autumn it had been completed. The new roof is a needed 

 improvement, being thoroughly waterproof and fireproof, while it 

 admits an abundance of light to the Museum galleries. 



This work necessitated the temporary closing of the old ^luseum to 

 the public and the removal of all the collections from the upper gallery, 

 while the cases on the lower floor had to be boarded up for their better 

 protection. The rearrangement of the collections is now in progress 

 and will be pushed rapidly during the coming year. 



Two thousand and sixteen cubic feet of exhibition cases uniform 

 with those previously installed have been ordered for birds, inver- 

 tebrate fossils and the McCook collection of insect architecture. 



A number of air-tight metal storage cases have been provided for the 

 bird and mammal skins and for the Herbarium. 



Mr. Clarence B. Moore has continued his exploration of the Indian 

 mounds of the Gulf States and has still further enriched his unrivalled 

 collection. 



Through the liberality of Mrs. Charles Schaeffer, Mr. Stewardson 

 Brown was enabled to spend two months collecting botanical speci- 

 mens in the Canadian Rockies, where he obtained about 4,000 plants 

 representing 700 species. 



Dr. Henry Skinner visited Idaho in the interest of the Academy for 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 587 



the purpose of making entomological collections, hut a serious attack 

 of illness materially interfered with his work. 



Dr. H. A. Pilsbry spent October and November in the prosecution 

 of his studies on the molluscan fauna of Arizona. 



In addition to these extended expeditions many local collecting 

 trips have been undertaken by the members of the Museum staff and 

 much valuable material secured. 



Among the more notable accessions to the Museum during the year 

 may be mentioned the Gulick collection of Hawaiian mollusks, which 

 formed the basis of Mr. Gulick's well-known paper on "Evolution, 

 Racial and Habitudinal"; the collection of bird skins formed by the 

 late Canon Tristram, of Durham, England, representing over 3,000 

 species from all parts of the world, a large proportion of them new to 

 the Academy's collection; and another valuable collection of marine 

 invertebrates from Naples, presented by Dr. Henry C. Chapman. 



A nimiber of valuable mammals received from the Zoological Society 

 of Philadelphia or by purchase have been mounted by the taxidermist 

 and many others prepared as skins or skeletons. Considerable addi- 

 tions have been made to the alcoholic series in Herpetology. 



In addition to the services rendered by the Museum staff the Curators 

 are indebted to Dr. P. P. Calvert, Messrs. E. T. Cresson, Jr., and H. W. 

 Wenzel for aid in the Entomological department, and to Mr. S. S. 

 Van Pelt in the Herbarium. 



Details of the year's work in several departments are appended. In 

 addition Dr. J. P. Moore has continued the care and study of the 

 Helminthological collections, and Mr. H. W. Fowler of the Fishes, 

 while Miss H. N. Wardle has made progress in cataloguing and arrang- 

 ing the Archseological collections. 



The Anti-Tuberculosis Society, Philadelphia Botanical Club, and 

 Delaware Valley Ornithological Club have held their meetings in the 

 Academy during the year. The collections have been consulted by 

 many visiting scientists and specimens have been loaned to Robert 

 Ridgway, H. W. Henshaw, H. L Smith. C. Hart Merriam, D. G. Elliot, 

 M. W. Lyon, H. F. Osborn, E. B. Williamson, Frank Stephens, G. W. 

 Clapp, A. N. Caudell, O. P. Hay, O. A. Peterson, G. S. Miller, Jr., F. 

 C. Baker, Lawrence Bruner, Earl Douglass, and E. W. Nelson.

Report of the Special Curator of the Department of Mollusca. 



Early in the year the entire collection of mollusks was removed from 

 the upper gallery, and has remained packed up during the construction 




588 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



of the new roof of the Museum. New cases have now been ordered, 

 which will enable us to rearrange the specimens during the coming 

 year. Meanwhile work has been continued upon such parts of the 

 collection as were accessible. 



Large accessions have been received from numerous correspondents 

 of the Curator. A list of these gifts may be found in the accessions 

 to the Museum. The largest single accession has been the collection 

 of Hawaiian land snails purchased from Dr. John T. Gulick. This 

 series served as the basis of that author's important studies on evolution, 

 as well as his systematic papers on the Hawaiian fauna. Mr. H. 

 Bloomfield Moore has contributed largely to our series of small land 

 mollusks of Georgia and Florida by gatherings of leaves and humus, 

 from which large mnnbers of shells have been picked by Mr. Vanatta. 



The Special Curator has been occupied chiefly with the preparation 

 of the Manual of Conchology, the monograph of the family 

 Achatinidce being completed this year, and the collections of this group 

 revised and relabelled. Studies of American and Japanese mollusks 

 have also been continued. The months of October and November 

 were spent in Arizona and New Mexico, chiefly in the Grand Canyon 

 of the Colorado, the Florida and Chiricahua Mountains, and large 

 collections of the mollusca of these regions were obtained. 



Mr. E. G. Vanatta has continued his efficient work as Assistant in the 

 department throughout the year.

MiNERALOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL SECTION. 



Nine meetings of the Mineralogical and Geological Section were held 

 during the year with a fair attendance, and the finances of the Section 

 are in good condition. Seven excursions were made to interesting 

 localities and proved to be enjoyable to all who participated in them, 

 as well as an agreeable method of study and recreation. There was an 

 average attendance on these occasions of about 30. 



At the annual meeting held December 17, 1906, the following 

 officers were elected :

tion have been published in the Entomological News. Volume XVII 

 of this journal has been completed with 404 pages and 15 plates. The 

 number of authors contributing articles was 92. Two thousand two hun- 

 dred and seventeen insects were added to the collection. Nearly all of 

 these have been properly incorporated in the cabinets. The number 

 added this year has not been as great as in the two previous years, but 

 there have been a number of valuable types presented and many gaps 

 filled. The more important additions were 460 insects of various 

 orders from P. P. Calvert ; 305 Pennsylvania and New Jersey specimens 

 with accurate data; 175 from Arizona, H. A. Pilsbry; collections from 

 Mexico and the Western States from Henry Skinner ; a collection from 

 Minnesota, Witmer Stone; a valuable lot of mosquitoes from New 

 Jersey, H. L. Viereck; blind Carabidoe from caves in Europe, H. W. 

 Wenzel, and a small collection from Panama from H. E. Wetherill. The 

 efficiency of the metal case or cabinet has been further demonstrated 

 during the past summer. Some insects kept in wooden cases were 

 damaged by mould, owing to the excessive dampness and leakage of 

 the temporary roof on the building. At a meeting held December 27, 

 the following officers were elected to serve for 1907:

The Botanical Section. 



During the past year the work of placing the specimens in species 

 covers was begun, the work in more than half of the Herbarium being 

 completed to date; the balance will be arranged in the early part of 

 the coming year. 



Additions to the Herbarium have numbered about 9,000 sheets ; of 

 these we have received as an exchange from the New York Botanical 

 Gardens of about 1,100, including a set of 899 sheets of Dr. Abrams' 

 Southern California plants, 87 sheets from Central America and the 




1906.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 591 



West Indies and 100 Characeoe from the herbarium of the late Dr. T. F. 

 Allen. 



Specimens have been presented by Dr. Ida A. Keller and jNIessrs. 

 Joseph Crawford, Charles S. Williamson, Bayard Long, Benjamin H, 

 Smith, Stewardson Brown, Samuel S. Van Pelt, Dr. John W. Harsh- 

 berger, Witmer Stone and the Philadelphia Botanical Club, from vari- 

 ous parts of the eastern United States, amounting to about the same 

 number. 



The Section has purchased the following: From ^Ir. A. A. Heller, 

 2,400 Calif ornian plants ; from Dr. Charles H. Shaw, 545 British Colum- 

 bian plants; from A. O. Garrett, 100 Utah plants; from Dr. J. W. 

 Blankinship, 583 Montana plants. 



Through the liberality of Mrs. Charles Schaeffer, the Conservator 

 was enabled to spend the months of June and July collecting in the 

 Canadian Rocky Mountains, in the provinces of Alberta and British 

 Columbia. More than 4,000 specimens were made, covered by over 

 800 numbers. Several sets of duplicates of this collection will be 

 available for exchange. 



Valuable assistance has been rendered by Miss Ada Allen in mounting 

 specimens and Francis W. Pennell in cataloging and arranging sama 



The Philadelphia Botanical Club has continued to hold its meetings 

 at the Academy during the year, about 1,800 sheets having been added 

 to the local Herbarium, which has been assiduously cared for by Mr. 

 Samuel S. Van Pelt, its curator. 



At the annual meeting of the Botanical Section the following were 

 elected to serve as its officers for the coming year: 



Director, ...... Benjamin H. Smith. 



Vice-Director, ..... Joseph Crawford. 



Recorder, ..... Charles S. Williamson. 



Treasurer and Conservator, . . Stewardson Brown.

The Ornithological Section. 



During the past year the remainder of the mounted birds, with the 

 exception of the song birds and ostriches, were removed to the new 

 building and placed in the cases provided for them, all of the specimens 




592 



PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[Dec. 



being examined by the taxidermist and thoroughly cleansed. Three 

 new cases to accommodate the groups above mentioned are now nearly 

 completed, so that the arrangement of the new bird gallery will be 

 finished at an early date. 



Ten additional cases have been procured for the study series of skins, 

 which is increasing at a rapid rate and is much consulted. 



During the past year the Academy secured by purchase the collection 

 of bird skins belonging to the late Canon Tristram, of Durham, Eng- 

 land. This comprises about 7,000 specimens, representing some 

 3,000 species, the avifauna of British Guiana and of various insular 

 groups being particularly well represented. Altogether it forms one of 

 the most notable accessions that has been made to the Ornithological 

 department and brings the total number of specimens in the Academy's 

 collection close to 55,000, while it adds a large number of forms previ- 

 ously unrepresented in our series. 



Several nests and sets of eggs have been added to the Delaware 

 Valley Ornithological Club Collection, rendering this local exhibit still 

 more nearly complete. 



The Club has held its meetings in the building of the Academy 

 during the year, and its members, as well as many visiting ornithol- 

 ogists, have studied the collections. 



Mr. J. A. G. Rehn has rendered important service during the year 

 in cataloguing and arranging the accessions.
