From George Ord, Esq., dated Philadelphia, Jan. 1st, 1852, presenting 

 his acknowledgments for his election as President of the Institution. 

 I Dr. Leidy read a continuation of Mr. Dana's paper on the Crustacea 

 of the late U. S. Exploring Expedition, which was on motion referred to 

 the Committee on the former portions of the paper. 



Dr. Leconte read a paper entitled '* Notice of fossil Dicotyles from 

 Missouri," and also a *' Notice of some fossil Pachyderms from Illinois; 

 both of which being intended for publication in the Proceedings, were 

 referred to Dr. Leidy, Dr. Carson and Mr. Moss. 



Dr. Leidy read the following remarks by Dr. J. L. Burtt, U. S. N., 

 on the influence of Sulphuretted Hydrogen arising from the bottom of 

 the Bay of Callao on the fishes in its waters : 



'* One occurrence always excited much interest, whenever there was an evolu- 

 tion of sulpho-hydric acid gas (a frequent occurrence) from the bottom ol the 

 Bay of Callao. The first premonition of what was to produce a remarkable 



raOCEED. ACAD. NAT. SCI. Or PHILADELPHIA. VOL. VI. NO. I. 1 




2 [January, 



destruction among fish, was the discoloration of the water of the bay, from a 

 marine green to a dirty milk-white hue, followed by a decided odor of the gas; 

 so much of it being present on many occasions as directly to blacken a clean piece 

 of silver, and to blacken paint work in a few hours. 



The fish, during this evolution, rose in vast numbers from the bottom; and after 

 struggling for sometime in convulsions upon the surface, died. 



I was particularly struck by this fact, that all of them during the time that they 

 were under its influence, acted in precisely the same manner. The first thing 

 noticeable with regard to its effect upon them, was that on coming near the surface, 

 they seemed to have much difficulty in remaining below it at all. They then 

 rose completely to the surface, struggling vainly to dive beneath. This was 

 followed by violent springing and darting in various directions evidently with- 

 out control of direction for they moved sideways, or upon the back, and some- 

 times tail first, with great velocity. After a little time their motion became 

 circular, and upon the back, the circle of gyration constantly diminishing, and the 

 rapidity of the motion as constantly increasing, until there was a sudden cessation 

 of all motion. The head then floated about the surface, the body being in a perpen- 

 dicular position. A few convulsive movements shortly followed, and they were 

 dead. 



I have watched thousands of them so dying ; and in every instance such was the 

 mode of death. Having taken them at the moment of death and immediately after, 

 a rude examination showed in all the same appearances. The intestines and brain 

 were gorged with blood, much darker than natural. The gills were almost black, and 

 the air-bladder ruptured. A premonitory symptom that such destruction was about 

 to occur, was the previous appearance of unaccountable numbers of fishing-birds, 

 especially of the Pelicans. On one occasion, taking the known size of the Island 

 of San Lorenzo as a guide for measurement, we concluded that there was a body 

 of Pelicans 5 miles long, one mile wide, and 300 feet thick, filling the water and 

 air as closely as possibly they could do. How many were there ? Can we wonder 

 at the size of guano deposits ?'' 



Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to a fossil tooth and a 

 fragment of a second, from the collection made by Mr. Culbertson in 

 Nebraska Territory, which, he observed, belonged to a new species of 

 Rhinoceros, or probably Acerotherium. The former specimen is proba- 

 bly a third premolar, the latter a portion of the fourth. A great pecu- 

 liarity in the teeth is the confluence of the inner lobes with each other, 

 and their separation to the base from the outer lobes. They possess a 

 remarkably strong basal ridge, and indicate an animal larger than any 

 species of existing Rhinoceros : the greatest transverse diameter of the 

 third premolar being 2^ inches; its antero-posterior diameter If inches. 

 For the species the name Rhinoceros Americanus is proposed. 



Dr. Leidy also called the attention of thv9 members to the fine mounted 

 specimen of Polar Bear now in the Hall, the skin of which had been 

 lately presented by Dr. E. K. Kane, U. S. N. 



On motion of Dr, Fisher, the letter of Mr. Peale, read this evening, 

 was referred to the Library Committee, with power to act. 



Dr. Fisher announced that the collection of fossil foot-prints of Fishes, 

 belonging to Mr. Dexter Marsh, of Greenfield, Mass., was for sale. 



On motion of Mr. Moss, the suggestions contained in the Report of 

 the Librarian for 1851, were referred to the Library Committee.

January \^tli. 

 Vice-President Wetherill in the Chair. 



Dr. Leidy presented an additional portion of Mr. Dana's communica- 

 tion on the Crustacea of the hite American Exploring Expedition ; which 

 was referred as before to the original Committee. 



Mr. Wetherill stated that the Phosphate of Lime, a specimen of which 

 lie presented this evening, was being much used for agricultural pur- 

 poses, after being decomposed by the action of sulphuric acid. 



Mr. Wetherill also stated that the Adipocire, also presented this even- 

 ing, was the result of decomposition of the bodies of a number of sheep, 

 which had been buried fifteen years since in a wet soil, on a farm in an 

 adjoining county. 



Dr. Leidy, referring to the Ctetacean remains characterized by him 

 at the meeting of December 9th, remarked that they were the first relics 

 of Mammals that have been found in the Cretaceous Group. 



On leave granted, the Committee to which was referred Dr. D. D. 

 Owen's paper describing a new Mineral and a new Earth, presented a 

 report, recommending the same for publication in the forthcoming No. 

 of the Journal, which was adopted. 



January 27th. 



Mr. Ord, President, in the Chair.

 Le Conte, reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings. 



Notes on some Fossil Suillne Pachyderms from Illinois.

DiCOTYLES DEPRESSTFRONS. 



Hyops depressifrons Lee. Am. Journ. Sc. 2d series, Vol. 5, 103 (1848.) 



After a careful comparison of the fragments of this animal with Dicotyles 

 torquatus, I have come to the conclusion that the differences are by no means 

 of such a nature as to admit of the formation of a peculiar genus. 



The differences in the cranium which distinguish this animal from D. torquatus 

 are : 1st, the greater depression of the front ; 2d, the greater expansion and less 

 sudden declivity of the malar plates ; 3d, the less convex nasal bones. In con- 

 sequence of this last character, the groove running forward from the frontal 

 foramen is more or less superior in its whole extent and never lateral, as in the 

 anterior part of the head of D. torquatus. 



The lower part of the skull and the anterior part of the nose are broken away, 

 so that no teeth remain in the fragment. 



Accompanying this fragment are four teeth from the upper jaw, which differ 

 from the corresponding teeth of Platygonus compressus Lee., from the same 

 locality, by having the transverse ridges more distinctly connected with the 

 basal margin ; this is especially the case at the posterior margin ; the ridges also 

 show a tendency to unite together, and thus the transverse valley is rendered a 

 little narrower than in Platygonus. In all these points the teeth agree exactly 

 with Dicotyles torquatus, and on a careful comparison nothing worthy of notice, 

 even as a specific difference, could be detected. A part of the socket of the left 

 superior canine, with the adjoining portion of the palatal plate, shows no differ- 

 ence on comparison with D. torquatus. 




4 [January, 



The base of the inferior left canine was found in its socket ; the remainder was 

 found broken; the fragments were put together so as to make almost a complete 

 tooth, which presents no specific characters of any importance ; the anterior 

 margin is more rounded than in D. torquatus, and the grooves on the posterior, 

 external, and internal faces of the fang are deeper ; the young of D. torquatus 

 in the depth of the grooves agrees perfectly with our fossil, which, however, 

 from the wearing of the tooth, must have been an adult. 



The condyloid process of the right lower jaw was found broken off just below 

 the neck; in comparison with D. torquatus, it is less concave in its external out- 

 line, and there is a slight depression externally just below the end of the articular 

 surface ; the posterior face a little below the articular part is more compressed 

 and less flattened than in D. torquatus. 



The inferior extremity of the humerus is perforated ; the articular faces are in 

 no respect different from those of D. torquatus. 



The same is the case with the innominatum and the femur. 



Of the left posterior foot is preserved the calcaneum, the outer metatarsal, the 

 first and second phalanges of the outer toe and the first phalanx of the inner toe ; 

 all these bones completely resemble the corresponding parts of D. torquatus. 



As compared with Platygonus compressus, the calcaneum shows important 

 characters, which may be used in separating the bones of these animals, if they 

 should again be found mixed together. 



In Platygonus the astragalian face is not distinctly defined at its supero-external 

 part, but is confluent with the depression existing in that part of the bone 

 behind the fibular process. 



In Sus and Dicotyles this face is distinctly separated from the valley between 

 the two processes, and the inferior part of the astragalian process is much less 

 thickened than in Platygonus ; the whole bone is more slender and less flattened 

 than in Platygonus. 



My reasons for considering the cuboides figured by me* as belonging to Platy- 

 gonus, are as follows : 



From teeth there was evidence of two specimens of Platygonus of different 

 ages; portions of three calcaneal bones of the left side were found, two of which 

 were precisely similar ; the third is the one here mentioned as belonging to 

 Dicotyles. The larger of the two similar bones fitted perfectly with the ex- 

 tremity of a tibia, an astragalus and a cuboides forming a considerable portion 

 of the tarsus ; to this cuboides, however, the metatarsal bone above described 

 cannot be adapted. 



This will be the proper place for correcting an important error in the memoir 

 on Platygonus already quoted: on page 270, pi. 4, figs. 23 and 24, is represented 

 what was considered the iywier metatarsal. On comparison this bone is found to 

 correspond accurately with the inner right metacarpal of Dicotyles ; there are 

 two specimens of this bone, differing slightly in size, and the smaller one of 

 which has lost its lower extremity, and evidently belonged to a young animal. 

 We have therefore the same reason to refer this to Platygonus as the tarsal bones 

 above mentioned. 



I should also notice here, that the superior canines of very young Dicotyles 

 resemble very closely those of Platygonus, but are not so much compressed, and 

 have only a single angulated line at the anterior part of the base of the tooth. 



On account of the very strong resemblance between the dentition of Platygonus 

 and Dicotyles, I am inclined to consider the former as rather Suiline than Tapi- 

 roid in its affinities; the undulated outline of the lower jaw in the Dicotyles 

 group, reaches its maximum in the great dilatation of the angle of the jaw in 

 Platygonus ; the compression of the canines is carried to a greater decree than in 

 any other genus, and the molar structure is reduced to the simplest Pachydermal 

 form by the absence of all accessary tubercles. 



The dimensions of the fragments of Dicotyles depressifrons indicate an animal

To the description of the teeth of this animal, I have only to add that the fang 

 of the canine is very similar to that of Sus babiroussa ; the posterior molar bears 

 considerable resemblance to that of Sus babiroussa, as represented by Blainville, 

 (plate VIII.) although the student will fail to find the resemblance in nature. The 

 Anthracotherium tooth figured in Owen's Odontography, with which I formerly 

 compared this tooth, differs in having the lobes connected by an elevated ridge. 



The dimensions of the teeth are as follows, and indicate an animal smaller than 

 a Peccary.

 posterior face and margin 2*46.

Notice of a fossil Dicotyles from Missoiiri. 

 By John L. Le Conte, M. D. 



The Tooth which forms the subject of this communication, was found with 

 some mastodon bones in Benton County, Missouri, and was presented to me by 

 Dr. R. W. Gibbes. 



It is a right lower canine, wanting the fang, and attached to a small piece of 

 jaw, containing alveoli of three incisors. 



The tooth has precisely the same direction as in D. torquatus, but is somewhat 

 less compressed ; the anterior edge is very acute ; on the part of the fang which 

 remains, no vestige of external and internal grooves exists ; the posterior groove 

 is well marked as in D. torquatus; on the outer surface of the tooth, nearer the 

 posterior than the anterior margin is an elevated ridge, acute at summit, which 

 extends along the whole of the enamelled part of the tooth. This character is not 

 to be found in T). torquatus ; the very obsolete elevation which exists there being 

 a consequence of the continuation of the grooves impressed on the internal face of 

 the fang; I have also failed to discover a similar elevated line on the canine of any 

 species of Sus which has come under my observation. 



As this seems to be a character of sufficient importance to separate the species 

 co-existent with the Mastodon, from any now living, 1 would give to it the name 

 ofDicotylescostatus. 



Although there is no character in this canine to make a reference to Dicotyles 

 more certain than to Sus, yet as the latter genus has not been distinctly proved to 




6 [Januahy, 



have inhabited this continent, and as in the existing creation Dicotyles is the true 

 equivalent of Siis in Annerica, the probability of our very distinct fossil species 

 belonging to Dicotyles is much increased ; this probability is rendered almost 

 certain, when we consider that remains of true Dicotyles have been found in 

 Illinois in company with other singular forms, (Platygonus and Anomodon) which 

 by their great peculiarities would seem to indicate a period anterior to that of 

 the Mastodon. 



The measurements of the canine are : length of enamelled surface along anterior 

 curvature 2-2 ; breadth of posterior surface -37 : radius of curvature of posterior 

 edge 2*0 ; of anterior edge 2*1.

PAGURIDEA, continued; and Subtribe MEGALOPIDEA. 

 I. Paguridea, continued. 



Among the species of the genus Pagurus, as restricted in my former paper on 

 the Paguridea, there are still three groups of distinct character ; one, having no 

 trace of a beak, the front being truncate, and also having the fingers opening in a 

 vertical plane, the hands being usually compressed, with commonly the left the 

 larger; a second, having a short beak or triangular point in front, and the fingers 

 opening like the preceding, with the hands subequal ; a third, having a beak like 

 the last, but the fingers opening in a horizontal plane, the hands being subequal 

 and more or less depressed, and never compressed. The first group has Pagiinis 

 punctulatics for its type; the second, P. a7iic7cl?is ; the third, P. clibanarius . 

 They form three genera with the following characters : 



1. Pagurus. Frons non rostratus, truncatus. Manus anticae saepius com- 

 pressae, interdum subacquae, saspius sinistra majore, digitis apice cornels, in piano 

 vertical! claudentibus. 



2. Aniculus, D. Frons triangulate rostratus. Manus anticae subaequae, 

 digitis apice cornels, in piano verticali claudentibus. 



3. Clibanarius, D. Frons triangulate rostratus. Manus anticae subaequa?, 

 plus minusve depressae, digitis apice cornels, in piano horizontali claudentibus. 

 Species P. ceqrialis, zebra, Jmmilis, glohosi-mcouis, Clibanario pertinent. 



The species Pagurus aniculus may hereafter be named Aniculus tyjdcris ; the 

 P. clibanarius, Cllhanarius vulgaris; and the P. Bernhardus, Bernhardus streh- 

 lonyx. The name Bernhardus pubescens, (see preceding volume, p. 270,) we 

 propose to change to B. scahricidus, as Kriiyer* has described a Pagurus pic- 

 hesceyiSf which is probably a Bernhardus.

II. Megalopidea. 



The question of the maturity or immaturity of the Megalopae and that of their 

 true place in the natural system, still remain in doubt. Without touching on 

 these points, at this time, I propose to describe some new genera and species 

 pertaining to the group. 



The species, however diverse, agree in the structure of the abdomen and its 

 caudal appendages ; in the position of the four antennae beHvee/i the eyes ; in the 

 articulations of the outer antennas j in the inner antennas folded longitudinally or 

 obliquely either side of the beak ; in the general form of the outer maxillipeds ; 

 in the large size and lateral position of the eyes without orbits; in the general 

 structure of the legs ; and in their habits. The beak is either horizontal or 




8 [January, 



flexed downward, and has usually a sharp prominent tooth either side of it, 

 exterior to the inner antennae. 



The genus Megalopa, Leach^ as now accepted, embraces two distinct sets of 

 species the M. Montagui and armata for which it was instituted by Leach, 

 and the M. mutica of Desmarest. The former (the true Megalopae) have the 

 beak nearly horizontal, with rarely a tooth either side, and there is a reflexed 

 spine on the ventral surface of the hrst joint of the 8 posterior legs. The latter 

 has the beak bent downward vertically, and either side of it there is a prominent 

 spine or tooth ; the ventral surface of the base of the legs is unarmed. The M. 

 mutica is very closely related to Monolepis spinitarsus of Say, the only differ- 

 ence being that the extremity of the posterior legs in this species of Monolepis 

 bear 3 or 4 setae rather longer than the tarsus, while the descriptions of the 

 mutica make mention of no such setae. The posterior legs in Monolepis fold up 

 and overlie the carapax : but these legs are otherwise like the preceding, though 

 somewhat smaller, and it is probable that this habit in the M. mutica has been 

 overlooked, as these animals almost always swim with the posterior legs ex- 

 tended like the others, when taken and kept in a jar for examination, and they 

 also have them extended when walking. These legs do not resemble at all the 

 posterior pair in Porcellana or Galathaea. I had examined several species before 

 I discovered this habit with regard to the posterior legs. The animal also throws 

 the fourth pair of legs forward along or over the borders of the carapax, so that 

 the extremity overlies the bases of the eyes and the tarsi hang down in front ; 

 and at the same time the two preceding pair are folded up and lie against the 

 sides of the carapax outside of the 4th pair, or the 3d pair may be thrown for- 

 ward like the 4th. A Sooloo species, and another common oflf Cape of Good 

 Hope, were observed swimming with the legs thus disposed. 



Say's genus Monolepis* also embraces two groups, alike in the deflexed front 

 and the longish setae at the extremity of the posterior tarsi. In one division, 

 including the M. inermisi the tarsi are flattened styliform, and unarmed, with 

 either lateral edge sparsely furnished with minute hairs ; the fossa of the sternum, 

 along which the abdomen lies when inflexed, has a prominent trenchant border ; 

 the depression on the carapax for the posterior legs is rather abrupt and some- 

 what neatly defined; the body is very convex and obese, with the sides high and 

 vertical, and much wider behind than before, being gradually narrowed forward. 



The other division has the tarsi unguiform, compressed, and spinous below, the 

 antepenult spine always longest; the fossa of the sternum with flaring borders^ 

 the depression of the carapax for the posterior legs shallow concave ; the body 

 more flattened above, with the sides more oblique. This division corresponds 

 to Monolepis spinitarsus. 



Besides the preceding, there is another group of Megalopidea, examined by the 

 author, resembling Megalopa of Leach, except that the tarsus of the posterior 

 legs is narrow lamellar instead of unguiculate, and edged with longish setae 

 somewhat shorter than the tarsus. 



There is still another group in which the front is horizontal and tricuspidate, 

 the inner antennae when retracted being exposed in the interval between the beak 

 or inner cusp and either outer, lying in view as in Plagusia. 



With these explanations we give the characters of the genera.

 Expedition under Capt. C. Wilkes, U. S. N. By James D. Dana. 



MACROURA. 



We follow De Haan in placing the genus Galathaea with the Anomoura ; and 

 near it we arrange iEglea, which widely differs from most other related species 

 in having penicillate instead of foliose branchiae. 



The Macroura, excluding these groups, includes three distinct sections or sub- 

 tribes. 



One, the "Fossores " of authors, or the Thalassinidea, has close relations on 

 one side with the Paguri, and on the other with the Squillidae. They constitute 

 a line of gradation between these extremes, independent mostly of the other 

 Macroura, and osculating only with the Astaci, although removed from them in 

 general habit and structure. There is a diversity among the legs as to form and 

 position, which is not found in any other Macroura, and calls to mind the Paguri. 

 Moreover, there is in general a looseness of structure, a length of abdomen, and 

 sluggish habit of body, unlike the trim compact forms of the typical Macroura. 

 The anterior feet are thrown directly forward and are thus fitted for the burrow- 

 ing habits of the species. 



The second subtribe the Astacidea is composed of the highest grade of 

 Macroura, approaching in some points of structure the Brachyura. This is seen 

 in the fact that the sides of the carapax fold under and unite to the epistome, as 

 is well shown in Scyllarus and less perfectly in Astacus ; also in the absence or 

 small size of the basal scale of the outer antennae. The Astaci are the transition 

 species between the other Astacidea and the Caridea, and in the genus Parane- 

 pkropSf White, the antennary scale is not smaller than is common in the latter 

 group. Yet they properly form part of the same section with the Scyllari and 

 Palinuri, rather than a separate division as made by Milne Edwards; they differ 

 from all the Caridea in the transverse suture across the carapax near its middle. 



The third section the Caridea includes the typical Macroura, which have 

 the sides of the carapax not soldered to the epistome, and a large basal scale to 

 the outer antennae.* 



* The Cumae would constitute another section Cumidea if mature animals. But 

 according to recent researches of Prof. Agassiz, as he has informed the author, they 

 are in some cases, and probably in all, immature forms of Palaemon, Crangon, and 

 other known Macroural genera. 




1852.] . 11 



These subtribes may be divided into families. 



Subtribe 1. Tkalassiiiidea. This section, as Milne Edwards observes, includes 

 two strongly marked divisions; ow, with only the ordinary thoracic branchiae, 

 and a second with the addition oi abdominal branchial appendages, as in the Squil- 

 lidae. The former we name the Thalassinidea Eubranchiata. the latter, the 

 Thalassinidea Anomobrayickiata. The first group embraces three families, dif- 

 fering strikingly in outer maxillipeds and abdomen, as explained beyond. The 

 second contains only two genera, Callianideai Edw., and IscRa^ Guerin the last 

 name was changed by Edwards to CalUanisea ; but as this word is so near Callia- 

 nassa and Callianidea, a contraction to Callisea would be preferable. 



Subtribe 2. Astacidea. In this subtribe, we adopt De Haan's sections, except 

 that we exclude the Megalopidea, and we do not associate the Thalassinidea 

 with the Astacidea. The sections or families are Scyllaridce, Fali?iundeB, 

 Eryonidce and Astacida. 



Leach in 1819 divided the old genus Astacus, naming the marine species 

 (Homarus Edw.) Astacus, and the fresh water (Astacus, Edw.) Potamobius, 

 Edwards' division, of like character, now generally accepted, was not published 

 till 1837. Leach hence has the priority. But according to Leach, the name 

 Astacus is appropriated, not to the typical part of the group, that including the 

 Astaczis fluviatilis of old authors, or Cancer Astacus of Linnaeus, and which em- 

 braces at the present time numerous species, but to that including the Cancer 

 Gammarzcs of Linnaeus, still but a small group. There is hence much objection 

 to the names of Leach, and moreover much confusion would now ensue from 

 their adoption. There seems therefore to be sufficient reason for rejecting them, 

 if it be of no weight that they have remained for 30 years unrecognised by 

 British authors. They are adopted in the Catalogue of British Crustacea of the 

 British Museum, published in 1850, but not in the general catalogue of 1847. 



Subtribe 3. Caridea. In arranging the Caridea into groups, much stress is 

 usually laid upon external form and length of beak. The unimportance of these 

 characters is inferrible from the fact that they involve no essential variations of 

 structure. Moreover, in a single natural group we may find both the long and 

 short beak. In the Crangon group, for instance, in which the beak is usually 

 very short and the body depressed, we have a species with the beak and habit of 

 a Hippolyte. 



There are other characters of more fundamental value ; and these have been 

 brought forward by De Haan. The mandibles afford the distinctions alluded to. 

 In one section they are very slender and are bent nearly at a right angle, with- 

 out enlargement at the crown. In another they are very stout, and somewhat 

 bent above with a broad dilated crown. In a third, they are stout, but not bent, 

 and have a dentate summit. In a fourth they have, in addition to a projecting 

 lateral crown, a large summit process, which is often oblong and very prominent. 

 These forms are characteristic of different sections of the Caridea. 



The fact that the mandibles bear a palpus or not is of much less importance ; 

 for the portion of the mandible which is most essential to its functions is the 

 crown. Among the Palaemoninae, there are genera having a mandibular palpus, 

 and others without one; while the two kinds in other respects are remarkably 

 close in their relations. We have found moreover that in this group, the length 

 of the palpus varies with the disjunction of the 2d and 3d flagella of the inner 

 antennae. If these flagella are separate to their bases nearly, (as in Palasmon,) 

 the palpus is long and 3-jointed ; if united for some distance up, the palpus be- 

 comes short and finally only 2-jointed (Palaemonella;) if united nearly or quite 

 to their summits, there is no palpus.* 



In the arrangement of the genera into families, the fact whether the 1st or 2d 



* In our genus Palsemonella, the palpus of the mandible is 2-jointed, and in ./fn- 

 chistia, which is closeiy like Palaemon in habit in some of its species, there is no 

 palpus, as in the Pontoniae ; and thus the transition to the Pontoniae from Palaemon 

 is exceedingly gradual. Harpilius and CEdipus (Pontoniae of authors) fill up the in- 

 terval between Anchistia and the true Pontoniae. They are all similar in having the 

 2d pair of legs largest, and in other prominent characteristics. 




12 [January, 



dair of legs is the stouter ^ is of great weight, much greater than previous authors 

 have recognised. In the Brachyura, the anterior pair is uniformly the strong 

 pair ; and this uniformity through so extensive a group shows that the variations 

 from it must be of importance in classification. This peculiarity of the Brachyura 

 i a consequence of the concentration of force in the cephalic or anterior portion 

 of the cephalothorax; and the diffusion of this force posteriorly, which in differ- 

 ent degrees marks the Macroura, is especially exhibited in the legs. It is there- 

 fore of no little interest to observe whether the first or the second pair is the 

 larger, or whether the degradation is still greater and the 3d pair is chelate like 

 the 2d and even stouter, as in the Penaei. By regarding this character we are 

 led to place Hippolyte and Rhyncocinetes with Alpheus, instead of with Palaemon ; 

 also Hymenocera and Pontonia with Palasmon, instead of with Alpheus; Pasi- 

 phaea in a distinct group from the Penaei, &c. Moreover, the Penaeinea, viewed 

 in this light and stripped of some unrelated genera, make a natural group, for 

 they are characterized by having the third pair of legs liJce the second, instead of 

 like the fourth. In the lowest forms among the Penaeinea, there are no chelate 

 or didactyle legs, and the species approach the Schizopods. 



In the preceding paragraphs we have but hinted at some of the more prominent 

 principles involved in the classification of the Macroura here presented, a fuller 

 exposition of which will be given in another place. Below is a synopsis 

 of the arrangement thus arrived at, and following this synopsis, are our descrip- 

 tions of new species.

During the past year the prosperity and activity of the Academy have been 

 sustained in the most gratifying manner. Its meetings have been fully attended ; 

 the number of valuable communications large, and the zeal of its members in the 

 pursuit of its objects unabated. Its appreciation by the public is made con- 

 stantly more manifest, in the numero^as visitors to its collections, and in the 

 interest shown by the community in its results. 



We have had, however, to regret, during this period, the loss by death of 

 several of our most active and distinguished members. After what has been 

 written by so much abler pens, however, it would be presumptuous to attempt 

 to add, in this place, anything in testimony of their merits and attainments, or in 

 expression of the esteem in which they were held among us. 



All of which is respectfully submitted by 



B. Howard Rand, 



Recording Secretary.

February Zd. 

 Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



The following communication was read from Henry A. Ford, M. D., 

 dated Glasstown, G-aboon River, West Africa, Nov. 10th, 1851, on the 

 characteristics of the Troglodytes Grorilla, accompanying the very fine 

 skeleton of that animal presented by him to the Academy, and announced 

 this evening. 



"The skeleton that I have the honor of presenting to your Society, is that of the 

 newly discovered species of Orang, which was first described by Drs. Savage 

 and Wyman, (in the Boston Journal of Natural History, 1847) and by them called 

 Troglodytes Gorilla, and by the natives on this coast, "Ngena." 



The earliest distinct notice of this species of Orang was made, I believe, by 

 Bowditch in 1817, on his return from his Ashantee Mission in a vessel that 

 visited this river on its passage to England from Cape Coast Castle. His de- 

 scription, though in many respects incorrect, doubtless refers to this species, as 

 the name and locality sufficiently identify the animal he describes with the 

 specimen I have obtained.* 



I would also remark here, that all subsequent information, as well as all the 

 specimens in the hands of Europeans, have been obtained in this river. 



This animal inhabits the range of mountains that traverse the interior of 



* See Mission to Ashunlee byT. Edward BowdilchEsq., 4to, London, 1819. Chapter on 

 Gaboon River. 




1852.] 31 



Guinea, from the Cameroons on the north to Angola on the south, and about 100 

 miles inland, and called by Geographers Crystal Mountains. The limit to which 

 this animal extends either north or south, I am unable to define. But that limit 

 is doubtless some distance north of this river. I was able to certify myself of this 

 fact in a late excursion to the head waters of the Mooney (Darger) river, which 

 comes into the sea some 60 miles from this place. I was inlormed (credibly I 

 think) that they were numerous among the mountains in which that river rises, 

 and far north of that. In the south this species extends to the Congo river, as I 

 am told by native traders who have visited the coast between the Gaboon and 

 that river. Beyond that I am not informed. This animal is only found at a 

 distance from the coast in most cases, and according to my best information, 

 approaches it nowhere so nearly as on the south side of this river, where they 

 have been found within ten miles of the sea. This, however, is only of late 

 occurrence- I am informed by some of the oldest Nysorgine men that formerly 

 he was only found on the sources of the river, but that at present he may be 

 found within half a day's walk of its mouth. 



Formerly, he inhabited the mountainous ridge where Bushmen alone inhabited, 

 but now he boldly approaches the Nysorgine plantations. This is doubtless the 

 reason of the scarcity of information in years past, as the opportunities for re- 

 ceiving a knowledge of this animal have not been wanting : traders having for 

 100 years frequented this river, and specimens, such as have been brought here 

 within a year, could not have been exhibited without having attracted the at- 

 tention of the most stupid. 



I shall not attempt in this sketch to give the osteology of the Ngena as the 

 skeleton itself will demonstrate that. I will, however, make some remarks upon 

 his appearance and habits, color and hair. 



At adult age the Ngena is of a dark or iron gray color the hair being black 

 at its extremities, but white next the skin, which produces the grizzly appearance 

 1 have described. In a young one that I have seen, it was black down to the skin 

 like that of the Troglodytes Niger. I am informed by one of the head men of this- 

 tribe, that they sometimes are found white. He had seen one of this description 

 to the N. E. of this at the foot of the mountains. This may have been the effect 

 of old age, as the animal is reported to have been full sized. It is a general 

 opinion that it becomes lighter by age. 



The hair diflers from that of the Troglodytes Niger, in its greater thickness 

 and length. On the neck, back and limbs, it is not less than six inches. It also 

 presents a more shaggy appearance from its slight curl at the extremities. The 

 length of hair, together with the thickness of skin and the great developement of 

 muscle hereafter to be described, give the Ngena a hugeness that can hardly be 

 conceived from a simple examination of the skeleton. 



Bowditch's assertion that he was apparently four feet in diameter through the 

 shoulders is as correct as most other statements in his book. The specimen 

 sent was three and a half feet from the extremity of the hair on one shoulder 

 to that on the other, and yet this is by no means the largest specimen that has been 

 obtained. 



Sii?i. The skin is very thick on the exposed parts of the body. On the arms, 

 shoulders, back and limbs, the thickness is one fourth of an inch ; on the head over 

 the crest three fourths of an inch thick ; the great thickness prevented my pre- 

 serving it. 



Head The most prominent feature in the fresh subject, as well as in the 

 skeleton, is the crest or ridge in the course of the parieto-parietal suture^ increasing 

 in height from before backwards to a point directly over the intersection of this 

 suture with the occipito-parietal which is the highest point. This crest is not 

 chiefly formed by the bony ridge on the skull, but by the thickness of the scalp 

 before mentioned, and by the length and stiffness of the hair, which is always 

 erect. 



This crest the animal when enraged is said to draw forward, giving him an 



appearance more fierce than ordinary, which is frightful enough. This crest gives 



the face and head a more anthropoid appearance than the dried skull presents. 



This projection gives it the appearance of a forehead. The face, unlike that of the 




32 [February, 



Chimpanzee, is covered with short hair, except about the mouth and nose. The 

 eyes are moderately large, not prominent, of a dark chestnut color.' The nose 

 is broad, projecting a very little above the surface of the face. The alae are of 

 thin and loose skin, capable of considerable distension. The mouth is very wide 

 the upper lip thick and hairless. The lower lip is a huge muscular flop, very 

 distensible, which the animal drops over his chin when he is enraged, making his 

 appearance exceedingly terrific. 



The ears are disproportionally small ; they are hairless and stand out from the 

 head. The muscles of the head are large, filling up a large part of the depressions 

 between the ridges of the scull. The auricular group not large, but the tempo- 

 ral, pterygoid and masseter muscles are of great strength, as might be supposed 

 from the size of the inferior maxillary bone. The neck is of moderate length, 

 but of great size, chiefly owing to the great length of the spinous processes of the 

 several vertebrae, but increased by the thickness of skin and length of hair. The 

 circumference of neck of this specimen was one foot and ten inches. 



The chest is narrow anteriorly and superiorly, but the contents of the entire 

 cavity large, the lower end of the sternum projecting, and the sternal cartilages, ex- 

 cept the first three, long. The circumference of the chest, after the evacuation of the 

 thorax and abdominal viscera, was four feet four inches. These viscera were 

 evacuated by the natives before I received the body. All the muscles of the 

 chest are largely developed, as are also all the muscles of the trunk. 



The arms, it will be seen from the skeleton, are longer in proportion to the trunk, 

 than are those of the small Chimpanzee, and are covered with a great weight of 

 muscle. 



At the insertion of the deltoid the circumference in this specimen was one 

 foot and four inches. The fore arm also is well supplied and covered with hair. 

 The circumference of the wrist was one foot. 



The palm of the hand was large, while the fingers and thumb appeared small 

 in proportion to the strength of the arm and fore arm. The palm and surface of 

 the hand and fiUi^ers is covered with a thick black skin very little adherent to th6 

 true skin beneath, and in appearance resembling a leathern glove. It was re- 

 moved entire, after maceration. The dorsal surface is covered with hair. The 

 abdomen is large, and covered with lighter colored hair than the back. 



The genital organs, in both male and female, are small, but in other respects 

 similar to the smaller species. 



This animal is tailless and has no calosities. The lower limbs are very short 

 and slightly curved, but the most remarkable peculiarity is the size of the muscles 

 which cover the femur, i. e. those having their origin on the anterior and inferior 

 surface of the pelvis, and their insertion on the femur, together with the extensors 

 and flexors of the legs. Their weight in this case was 18 lbs. The muscles of 

 the leg and foot are not as fully developed as those of the thigh. In the shape of 

 the foot he resembles other Orangs. The weight of this specimen was 170 lbs. 

 without the thoracic, abdominal and pelvic viscera. 



Food. He feeds on the various roots and fruits found in the forest. He is, 

 however, to some extent carnivorous, according to my most reliable information. 



When man is his prey, he devours him as he does animals that he can catch, 

 though his sluggishness prevents his taking many animals as prey. 



The Ngena generally walks on all fours, with his feet placed flat on the ground, 

 like a man, the thighs being flexed upon the leg, at an acute angle. 



The open hands are placed on the around posteriorly and externally to the 

 feet, the arms being nearly parallel to the axis of the body, and thus supporting 

 the body posteriorly to the feet, and not anteriorly, as some have supposed. They 

 act the part of hind rather than fore feet. 



The gait is an oscillating motion, caused by carrying forward the extremities 

 of one side at a time, while the body is balanced to the opposite side; then alter- 

 nately moving the other limbs with a return motion of the body. This is the 

 movement 1 have seen in the young animal. Besides this gait, 1 am led to be- 

 lieve that in the forest he has a semi-erect posture, supporting h'mself by bushes 

 and trees as they come in his way. 



He sometimes walks erect, and always rises on his feet when making an 

 attack, though he approaches his antagonist in the stooping posture. 




1852.] 33 



The Ngena is represented as the most terrible monster of his native forests. 

 His appearance is hideous even when dead. Among the natives he is the subject 

 of many allegories, in which he acts some distinguished part, perhaps that of a 

 king or a conqueror perhaps a defender or a destroyer. In the forests he seems 

 to be the implacable enemy of man. 



Though he never lies in wait, yet when he hears, sees or scents a man, he im- 

 mediately utters his characteristic cry, prepares for an attack, and always acts on 

 the offensive. The cry that he utters resembles a grunt more than a growl, and 

 is similar to the cry of the Chimpanzee when irritated, but vastly louder. It is 

 said to be audible at a great distance. His preparation consists in attending the 

 females and young ones, by which he is usually accompanied, to a little distance. 

 He, however, soon returns with his crest erect and projecting forward, his nos- 

 trils dilated and his under lip thrown down, at the same time uttering his 

 characteristic yell, designing, it would seem, to terrify his antagonist; instantly, 

 unless he is disabled by a well directed shot, he makes an onset, and striking his 

 antagonist with the palm of his hands, or seizing him with a grasp from which 

 there is no escape, he dashes him upon the ground and lacerates him with 

 his tusks. 



He is said to seize a musket and instantly crush the barrel between his teeth. 



Some hunters are said to have permitted him to take hold of the musket and 

 carry it to his mouth, firing as it passes between his teeth. This will, however, 

 appear to lack probability, though it is stoutly maintained by the natives. 



He is said to be always at war with the leopard, which he destroys if he suc- 

 ceeds in seizing him. The leopard, however, by his superior agility, often wears 

 him out. He is said to spring upon the back of the Ngena and lacerate his neck 

 with his teeth, escaping before he can be seized. This animal's savage nature 

 is very well shown by the implacable disposition of a young one that was brought 

 here. It was taken very young and kept four months, and many means were 

 used to tame it, but it was incorrigible, so that it bit me an hour before it died. 



The various stories of his building houses in imitation of the natives his 

 covering himself with bushes, which he hurls upon his antagonist in his attacks ; 

 vanquishing the elephant with clubs, or even using clubs at any time, and nu- 

 merous other accounts given to credulous whites, are considered ridiculous by 

 the best informed natives. Yet every Mpongue man has a fund of such stories 

 which he vends to children and every one else who will listen to them with 

 credulity. 



From my most careful inquiries I can find no one who believes that these 

 creatures are of the same original stock as black men, as some have reported. 

 By most it is considered an insult to suppose it. 



Hi flesh is considered delicate eating by the tribes where he is taken, though 

 the JJpongues consider it quite ' vulgar fare.' The slaves here, however, carried 

 away the flesh as soon as it was taken from the bones of my specimen."

34 [February, 



Resolved J That the thanks of the Academy be presented to Dr. 

 Ruschenberger for the labor he has bestowed in the preparation of the 

 able and faithful Notice read by him before the Society, and that he be 

 requested to furnish a copy of the same to the Committee on Proceed- 

 ings for publication. 



Resolved, That a Committee of three members be appointed to com- 

 municate the foregoing Resolutions to Dr. Ruschenberger. 



Committee, Mr. Vaux, Dr. Bridges and Mr. Pearsall. 



The Rev. Mr. Langstroth read a paper entitled, "On the impreg- 

 nation of the eggs of the Queen Bee ;" which being intended for publi- 

 cation in the Proceedings, was referred to Dr. Leidy, Dr. Le Conte and 

 Dr. Fisher. 



Dr. Le Conte presented for publication in the Proceedings, the fol- 

 lowing papers : " Hints towards a Natural Classification of the family 

 Histrini of Coleopterous Insects ;" " Synopsis of the Parnidae of the 

 United States -j" " Synopsis of the Eucnemidee of Temperate North 

 America ;" all of which were referred to the following Committee : Dr. 

 Bridges, Dr. Leidy and Dr. Elwyn. 



A letter was read from the Librarian of the British Museum, dated 

 Jan. 19th, 1852, acknowledging the receipt of No. 10, Vol. 6, of the 

 Proceedings. 



Also a letter from the Royal Academy of Sciences of Stockholm, 

 dated April 20th, 1851, acknowledging the receipt of No. 12, Vol. 4, 

 and No. 1, Vol. 5, of the Proceedings. 



And a second letter from the same, of same date, accompanying copies 

 of the Transactions and Bulletin of that Institution for 1849 and '50. 



Dr. Leidy presented, for the inspection of the members, an interesting speci- 

 men of a fossil turtle, from the collection of Dr. D. D. Owen, made in Nebraska 

 territory, and sent to him, for examination, by the Smithsonian Institute. It 

 proves the existence of a species distinct from any of those before described from 

 the same region, for which the name Emys Ctdbertsonii is proposed. Its mea- 

 surements are as follows : 



Length of the five vertebral scutes, . . .17 inches. 



Transverse breadth of carapace in curve, 

 Height, ..... 

 Length of middle vertical scute, 

 Breadth < < 



Mr. Phillips announced that the collection of Minerals of the late 

 Mr. Gilmore, of Baltimore, was for sale. 



February Vltli. 

 Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



Letters were read from the Secretary of the Trustees of the New 

 York State Library, acknowledging the receipt of No. 12, Vol. 6, of the 

 Proceedings, and of a copy of Dr. Meigs' Memoir of Dr. Morton. 



From the Geological Society of London, dated June 24th and Nov. 

 6th, 1851, returning thanks for copies of late Nos. of the Proceedings. 



Mr. Vaux, on behalf of the Committee on the subject, read a commu- 




1852.] 35 



nication from Dr. Kuschenberger, dated Philadelphia, Feb. 13, 1852, 

 in reply to the letter from the committee, enclosing a copy of the Reso- 

 lutions adopted at the last meeting in relation to his " Notice of the 

 Academy. '' 



Dr. Leidy directed the attention of the members to several fossils lying on the 

 table, which belong to the cabinet of the Academy. 



One of them is a lumbar vertebra, without the epiphyses, and with the trans- 

 verse processes and neural arch broken off, obtained from the Miocene of Vir- 

 ginia, and presented by Mr. T. Conrad. It belongs to a species of Delphinus, 

 most probably extinct, for which the name D. Conradi is proposed, in honor 

 of one who has done so much in American Palaeontology. The epiphysial extre- 

 mities of the vertebral body are pentahedral. 



Length of vertebral body, . . . . 2i inches. 



Breadth of epiphysial extremities, . . .11" 



Breadth of base of transverse processes, . . H " 



The other specimens consist of an entire dermal scale and the half of a second, 

 from the Green Sand formation of Mount Holly, New Jersey. These belong to 

 some Crocodilian reptile of large size. They are deeply sculptured, but possess 

 no carina, as in the existing Crocodiles. Possibly they may belong to the Sau- 

 rian, characterized from some vertebrae under the name of Cimoliasaurus magnus*

Dr. Le Conte offered the following observations : 



On the Difference between Primordial Braces and Introduced Races. 



A want of power to discriminate between permanent varieties developed in 

 species and primordial forms, has been a prolific source of confusion in all dis- 

 cussions regarding the plural origin of species. I propose to examine here into 

 some differences which, so far as lam able to learn, will form a certain basis for 

 this distinction, so much to be desired ; and which, should they be found, on far- 

 ther examination, to have the universal character which I am inclined to give 

 them, may have the effect of saving the world much of the muddy philosophy, 

 which seems to be the favorite style of ethnological writers. 



The principle which I am about to lay down, is founded on the unchangeability 

 of certain characters, throughout an entire genus; these characters are connected 

 with the structure of the external parts, and may seem at first to be of but slight 

 importance, yet generally, on close examination, they will be found more or less 

 intimately connected with the functions which the animal is destined to perform 

 in the system of nature. 



Now, it is a singular fact, that all the varieties of domestic animals and plants, 

 which can be clearly shown to have originated in unmixed breeds, differ from their 

 parent stocks by characters which, except in the case of these, so to speak, artifi- 

 cial varieties, are unchangeable in the genus. Thus, these artificial varieties 

 would seem to differ from their parent stocks, not by characters which are of 

 specific value, but by those which are of incomparably greater importance, and 

 which, if not accompanied by identical organization in all other organs, would 

 widely separate the beings which possess them from their parents. In many

instances the characters possessed by the artificial varieties, are absolutely 

 impossible in the plan on which the genus, or even the order, is created. 



Instances of such permanent varieties may be readily recalled by every one ; 

 some of the most familiar are : the hornless variety of domestic cattle; the" tail- 

 less variety of domestic cat, found in the Isle of Man ; the long-haired cat, known 

 as the Angora, or Persian cat; the various forms of fowls with additional toes, 

 and without tails ; the varieties of pigeons and fowls with uncouth and distorted 

 arrangement of plumage. 



The origin of some of these is lost in the depths of the past, while others are 

 continually being introduced. 



In all the examples cited above, it will be found that the monstrosity depends 

 on the loss of a character belonging to every species of the genus or tribe to 

 which the parent stock belongs, or on the assumption of a character not found in 

 any species or genus of that group. 



In the case of the hornless cattle, the part wanting, if not entirely coextensive 

 with the order of ruminants, is at least essential to the genus Bos. 



In the anomalously feathered varieties of fowls and pigeons, the animal assumes 

 structures either unknown in the groups to which it belongs, or else (as in the 

 case of the * ruffler') entirely impossible in any species of bird whatever. 



The novelty in this principle is, that in the disputed cases of plural origin, the 

 slightness of the unchangeable differences, found in different races, becomes a 

 very strong, and, indeed, an invincible argument against the supposition that they 

 have been derived from each other by the operation of external or internal causes. 



The advocates of the single origin of man or of dogs, are therefore in the 

 unpleasant predicament of having proved too much, since the difference between 

 the latter, on comparison with undeniable distinct wild species of wolf and fox, 

 are in those characters which alone can manifest specific distinction. 



In the case of man the differences are in such particulars as alone could be 

 changed without degrading him from his place at the head of the organic world. 



It is almost needless for me to add that this principle extends to the vegetable 

 kingdom, as every one will at once see in greenhouse and domestic plants, that 

 the cultivated varieties are distinguished from each other by important structural 

 differences, not recognized in the genera to which they belong. 



In all species or races there are individual differences of less importance than 

 specific characters, which by care may be isolated, and form what are apparently 

 races. Thus snub noses almost invariably reproduce snubs ; aquiline noses, in 

 the same way, continue in families for numbers of generations. Yet, not to speak 

 of the unimportance of such marks, these cases may be distinguished by the fre- 

 quency with which exceptions occur. The numerous varieties of cultivated 

 fruits come under this head.

Hints tovjards a Natural Classification of the Family Histrini of ColeojHcrous 



hisecls. 



' By John L. Le Conte, M.D. 



It is rarely that any subject treated by the illustrious Erichson is found capable 

 of improvement. It is therefore with rehictance and hesitation that after a mi- 

 nute study of the North American species oi Hister, I find myself under the 




1852.] '^'^ 37 



necessity of proposing important modifications of the arrangement adopted by 

 him.* 



The great increase in the number of our species, since the publication of the 

 monograph of Histers by my father,t has made me acquainted with many varia- 

 tions of structure, too unimportant to serve as foundations for separate genera, 

 yet absolutely incapable of entering any of the genera established by Erichson. 

 Some of these anomalous species have been described by me in the Annals of the 

 Lyceum of Natural History, vol. 5. 



By a careful comparison of such forms with the species to which, by obvious 

 characters, they are most nearly allied, I have been led to believe that the genera 

 in this group have been unnecessarily increased, by the use of principles of 

 division which are by no means of generic value, and which scarcely serve to 

 define small groups of species. 



I allude more especially to the structure of the tibiae, which holds so important 

 a place in the system of Erichson. The difficulty of deciding upon such an indis- 

 tinct character as the form of the tarsal groove of the anterior tibiae, and the 

 decidedly variant structure of the posterior tibiae in several of the genera, has 

 led me to reject entirely the characters drawn from those parts of the body. The 

 special variations referred to will be exposed more fully under the genera Hister 

 and Saprinus below. 



Following Erichson, I have divided the genera into three groups according to 

 the position of the head and the form of the prosternum. The genera may after- 

 wards be separated according to the following table :

I have included in this genus Omalodes and Platysoma; as they are founded 

 on slight differences in the form of the tibiae. Plaesius and Placodes will also 

 probably enter here ; at least I cannot find anything to separate them, except 

 differences in the spines of the posterior tibiae. 



The posterior tibiae of this genus, are generally broad, and externally armed 

 with two series of spines : sometimes a range of bristles on the posterior face of 

 the tibiae is enlarged so as to simulate a third row of spines ; sometimes (Hister 

 arcuatus Say) the whole outer surface of the tibiae is rough with confused spines ; 

 in H. costatus (n. sp.) the posterior tibiae are narrow, and the spines are very 

 fme : these tibiae are usually not toothed on the outer margin, yet in H. sexstri- 

 atus Lee. they are distinctly four-toothed : they are also toothed in the species 

 referred to Omalodes and Platysoma, the number of teeth in the latter being 

 variable, and the teeth themselves frequently indistinct: they are entirely smooth 

 in some small species allied to H. subrotundus, and belonging to Erichson's 3d 

 division ; the posterior feet are smooth, and the intermediate ones armed with a 

 single tooth near the apex in H. corticalis Lee. ; finally, the posterior tibiae are 

 broad, very much compressed and finely serrate in Omalodes Harrisii Lee. 



The anterior tibiae are broad, compressed and more or less distinctly toothed 

 on the outer margin, usually with a single row of very short articulated spines; 

 on the anterior face is a groove for the reception of the tarsus ; the inner margin 

 of this groove is sharply defined; the outer margin indistinct, in most species ; 

 more distinct in the species referred to Omalodes ; some of the species of Platy- 

 soma have the outer margin distinct, while in others (H. Carolinus Payk.) it is 

 quite indistinct. The species, with the exception of the large tropical species, 

 which would probably form a separate division, can be arranged according to 

 the following table ; the internal marginal stria of the thorax, when it exists, is 

 entire, and extends around the whole apex of the thorax ; the outer stria always 

 ends at the anterior angle.

The species found in the United States may be distributed as follows : 



1, corresponds to Omalodes Er. : the only United States is H. borealis (Omalo- 

 des borealis Lee.) 



2, contains only H. planipes (Omalodes Harrisii Lee.) The name Harrisii 

 being preoccupied for a species of group 6, must of course be changed. 



3, contains H. arcuatus Say; binotatus Lee; laevipes Er. and a new species 

 allied to arcuatus. 



*5, is composed of a Californian species, H. 6-striatus Lee. (An. Lye. ,1.) 



6, contains H. interruptus Beauv. {ohtusatus Harris) ; merdarius Payk ; im- 

 munisEr; Harrisii Kirby ; diversus Er. (stjjgicus hec.) ; fcedatns Lee. ; cogna- 

 tus Lee; marginicollis Lee, and one new species. 



7, contains H. dispar Lee; indistinctus Say; depurator Say; and one new 

 species. 



8, H. spretus Lee. ; curtatus Lee. ; and two new species. 



9, H. civilis Lee; ccenosus Er. {decisus Lee); punctifer Payk; abbreviatus 

 Fabr. ; bifidus Say, and perhaps H. repletus Lee. which I have not examined; it 

 is doubtful whether H, punctifer is really a native of our territory ; the only one 

 found may have been introduced. 



10, H. sedecimstriatus Say; americanus Payk. ; exaratus Lee. ; and two new 

 species. 



11, contains only H. bimaculatus Linn, {plliqmis Say). 



12, H. venustus Lee and corticalis Lee. Small flat species having the ap- 

 pearance of Platysoma ; the posterior tibiae are almost glabrous ; H. venustus 

 has the lobe of the prosternum shorter than any other species I have seen. 



13, H. subrotundus Er.and H.'vernus Say; small convex species, one of which 

 has an entire marginal stria on the thorax, the other none. A new species from 

 Mexico has an abbreviated stria at the margin of the thorax. 



14, contains the small flat species forming the genus Platysoma Leach as 

 amended by Erichson, the posterior tibiae are more or less distinctly toothed. 

 Our species are : H. carolinus Payk. ; depressus Payk. ; parallelus Say ; coarcta- 

 tus {Platy. coarctaticm Lee) ; and a new species. 



15, Cylindrical species allied to the preceding; H. cylindricus Payk. ; attenua- 

 tns (Plati/. atte?i7cat2imhec.) ', gracilis {Platys, gracile Lee, P. cylindrianiiX 

 Er., Hister frontalisW Say.) 



CiEROSTERNUS.

 profundi ad angulum thoracis inferne siti. Tibiae anticae compressae, subdila- 

 tatae, posteriores tenues glabrae ; tarsi posteriores non recepti. 



The body is globose, very convex ; the abdomen perpendicularly deflexed at 

 the tip : the funiculus of the antennae is filiform, the first joint longer and a little 

 thicker than the others ; the prosternum is very broad, truncate posteriorly, very 

 slightly rounded anteriorly; the cavities for the antennae are very deep^ situated 



* Group 4 is founded upon a curious nondescript Mexican species, H. rostatus, in 

 which the striae of the elytra are replaced by elevated ridges.

at the anterior angles, between the upper and under surface of the prothorax, and 

 open laterally. Only two species are known to me, 1. C. american^is 

 {Trlbalus ameriea /IU.S L,ec.) and 2. C. 1 ae v i s s i m u s, with the upper surface 

 very smooth and shining, the epipleurce less suddenly inliexed than in C. ameri- 

 canus, with only two very fine lateral strice ; the dorsal striae of the elytra ob- 

 solete: length -10. It is found in Cuba under the bark of trees, and was sent by 

 Don Felipe Poey. The body is narrower and more elevated than the preceding. 



Saprinus Leach. 



The posterior tibioe of this genus are usually but little dilated; the external 

 margin is furnished with three series of spines; some of the species of group 

 9, have four confused series (S. palmatus), others have the spines very dense 

 and occupying a large surface (S. sulcifrons). On account of these variations I 

 am inclined to unite Pachylopus (Er.) with this genus, although the singular 

 sexual character mentioned by Erichson is not found in any Saprinus. At all 

 events, if Erichson's species should remain as a distinct genus, it must be upon 

 very distinct characters from those indicated by him. 



The species known to me may be arranged as follows : 



A. Caput antice non marginatum ; prosternum compressum, elevatum, pla- 

 num ; epipleuraB tristriatae. 



Prosternum striis utrinque divergentibus. . . . , . .1.

 Prosternum compresso-carinatum, striis conniventibus, saspius indistinctis 9. 

 The United States species may be distributed as follows : 



1, Contains two Californian species : S. alienus Lee. ; discoidalis Lee. ; the 

 latter approximates somewhat to division C ; and in some specimens there is a 

 very faint trace of the double line found on the front of the species belonging 

 to that division. 



2, S. deletus Lee; interceptus Lee. 



3, S. interstialis Lee. ; a singular oblong species, with the striae of the elytra 

 nearly parallel. 



4, S. obscurus Lee. ; pectoralis Lee. ; paeminosus Lee. ; all from California. 



5, S. lugens Er. {californicus Man.) ; Oregonensis Lee. ; imperfectus Lee. ; 

 impressus Lee. ; infaustus {jpiceus^ Lee.) ; pensylvanicus Er. ; and three new 

 species. 



6, S. conformis Lee.; assimilis Er. ; minutus Lee.; placidus Er.; insertus 

 Lee. ; obductus Lee. ; ciliatus Lee. ; vinctus Lee. ; laridus Lee. ; scissus Lee. ; 

 and one new species. 



7, S. vestitus Lee; fimbriatus Lee; plenus Lee; vitiosus Lee; lubricus 

 Lee; ccerulescens Lee; all from California; and three new species, two of 

 which are from Missouri Territory, and the other from Georgia. 



8, S. sphaeroides Lee (/^-t'o-e^ier Lee) ; fraternus Lee ; mancus Lee (Jlister 

 mancus Say) ; estriatus Lee ; bigemmeus Lee ; and one new species. 



9, Contains species found near the sea shore ; they may be arranged in two 

 groups, according to the structure of the posterior tibiae. 



Those with the spines in three series are: S. patruelis Lee; lucidulus Lee 



Those with the spines more numerous and confused are : S. dimidiatipennis Lee 



(var. Ilister falmatas Say) ; sulcifrons Man. ; serrulatus Lee ; and gaudens Lee. ;

these species were referred by me to the genus Pachylopus (vide Ann. Lye. 

 Nat. Hist. 5.) The epipleurae of these last are marked with three striae. 

 The spines on the tibiae of S. dimidiatipennis are less numeroas than in the 

 others, and form four tolerably distinct series. 



Synopsis of the ParniDjE of the United States. 



By John L. Le Conte, M. D. 



As I have concluded, for reasons detailed below, to introduce the anomalous 

 genus Eurypalpus into this family, I have found it necessary to substitute an en- 

 tirely new diagnosis for the one given by Erichson. The one proposed by me, 

 in order to include the new genus, is as follows: 



AjitetincB frontales, no7i capitatce ; oculi rotundati, mandibidce retractce ; coxce 

 anticcB vel sitbcylindriccB, vel globosce. acetabulis e prostenio et metathoracis epi- 

 sternis compositis receptee ; pedes ambulatorii^ tarsi 5-articiilati ^ cyliiidriciy 

 unguicidari ornaximCjUnguihus validis armato ; trochanteres simplices ; abdomeii 

 5 l-articulatuviy articulis anteiiorib%Ls immobilibus. 



The character which especially distinguishes this family is the structure of the 

 tarsi, which enables the species to grasp firmly objects resting in strong currents 

 of water. This family may be divided into three groups. 



Div. 1, Ezcrypalpini, 



Caput exsertum, ore inferno, labro distincto, inter antennas transverse eleva- 

 tum ; coxae anficas transversae, trochantino valde conspicuo; parapleurae appen- 

 diculatae ; abdomen 7-articulatum. 



EuRYrALPusj Dej. 



Antennae serratae 11-articulatae ; palpi maxillares valde elongati, articulo ulti- 

 mo latiore, securiformi, apice subacuto ; labiales brevissimi, articulo ultimo 

 minuto subulato. 



This very remarkable genus is mentioned by name in Dejean's Catalogue, and 

 is placed by that author towards the beginning of bis group Malacodermata, near 

 Cyphon, with which, however, it seems to have but little affinity. Erichson, 

 probably never having seen the insect, referred it upon Dejean's authority, to 

 Cyphones, with a doubt. (Vide Agassiz Nom. Zool.) A close comparison with 

 other groups has convinced me, that although its affinities in any direction are 

 difficult to discover, it must still be considered as forming a part of the present 

 family. 



The body is depressed, narrowed in front, obtusely rounded behind. The 

 mandibles are small, acute and entirel)'' concealed by the broad and emarginate 

 labrum ; the mentum is trapezoidal ; the ligula short, square and slightly emar- 

 ginate at tip. The prosternum is truncate in front, prolonged behind into an 

 acute point which passes in a narrow groove extending the whole length of the 

 mesosternum. The anterior coxae are precisely as in Helichus ; the posterior 

 coxae are slightly laminate and dilated interiorly as in Helichus, but are conti- 

 guous at their base ; the parapleurse are broadly truncate at the external posterior 

 angle, and the parallelogram is completed by a large triangular plate. The ab- 

 domen is 7-jointed, the first three joints are immovable, the 5th deeply emar- 

 ginate, the 6th retracted so as to have only the edge visible, the last joint almost 

 round; the feet have the last joint much longer than the other four united, with 

 strong simple claws. 



The larva resembles in appearance a Trilobite, and has been described by 

 De Kay as a Crustaceous animal under the name Fluvicola Herricki. It is en- 

 tirely aquatic, and breathes by means of branchial filaments, the principal ot 

 which proceed from the anus. For a full description o{ it and the pupa see 

 Agassiz' Lake Superior. It bears a close comparison with the larva of Elmis by 

 Erichson, (Deutschl. Insect. 525).

The perfect insect lives on bushes over the surface of running water, and is 

 also found creeping over the wet stones in torrents ; the under surface of the 

 body is sericeous, with fine fulvous hair, perfectly like Helichus.

Western New York and Pennsylvania. The great facilities and assistance 

 which my father, Major Le Conte, has constantly extended to me in my scientific 

 labors, will be a sufficient excuse for my continuing the name under which this 

 curious insect is mentioned by Dejean, and by which it is already known to a 

 large number of European entomologists. 



Div. 2. Dryopini Er. 

 Coxae anticae transversae, trochantino conspicuo, abdomen 5-articuIatum. 



Lara. 



Caput porrectum, subtus non obtectum; antennae simplices elongatae. 



Body elongate, narrowed and subacute anteriorly. Head not deflexed ; anten- 

 nae with the first joint cylindrical, a little longer and thicker than the two follow- 

 ing, which are equal ; the fourth is a little shorter; the rest are broken off, (pro- 

 bably serrate. The labrum is large and broad, rounded in front, and scarcely 

 emarginate ; the mandibles slightly emarginate at tip. Mentum trapezoidal, 

 ligula broad, truncate in front. Prosternum with a short point behind, which 

 fits into the excavated mesosternum; middle coxae moderately distant; posterior 

 coxae contiguous at base, very slightly and gradually dilated internally. Legs as 

 in Helichus. The body above and beneath coated with very fine pubescence. 



This genus seems to be the desired link connecting the anomalous form Eury- 

 palpus with the true Parnidae ; the abdomen, coxae and feet are precisely the 

 same as in the latter, while the long simple antennae are anomalous in this sub- 

 division ; the large uncovered labrum is not seen in this subdivision, but is found 

 in Elmis, Macronychus, &c., of the next subdivision, to which, however, it 

 cannot be referred on account of the transverse form of the anterior coxae. The 

 thorax is much narrowed in front, with the posterior angles acute; scutellum 

 large, acute; elytra almost parallel, rounded at apex. The genus is named after 

 a water nymph. 



1. L. a vara, olivaceo-picea, thorace confertim grosse punctato, lateribus bi- 

 sinuatis, disco elevato, canaliculate, margine antico late depresso, elytris nitidis

Sacramento, California, Mr. Rathvon. The thorax has the disc suddenly ele- 

 vated and canaliculate, so as to present two large bosses, the lateral margin is a 

 little excavated anteriorly and posteriorly; the alternate interstitial spaces of 

 the elytra are more distinctly sericeous ; the feet are black, the femora at base 

 ferruginous.

 Lieut. H. Haldeman, U. S. A., at Fort Gates in Texas ; for my specimens I am 

 indebted to his brother S. S. Haldeman. The only other species known is from 

 Brazil.

Syiiopsis of the Eucnemides of Temperate North America. 

 By John L. Le Conte, M. D. 



Although many entomologists consider that the small group of Coleopterous 

 insects, herein treated, constitute a peculiar family, I am under the necessity, 

 after very careful examination, of viewing them as a mere section of the exten- 

 sive natural family of Elateridae, and no more entitled to a distinct place in the 

 series, than any other group of genera in that family. 



The character which essentially distinguished the Elateridae from allied families, 

 as Erichson* has pointed out, is the looseness of the articulation bet ween the pro-and 

 meso-thorax. In order to allow of greater liberty of motion, the posterior margin 

 of the infixed portion of the prothorax is more or less dilated, or concave, so as 

 to slide over the opposing part of the messothorax. 



This character, although good in theory, is nevertheless sometimes difficult to 

 be seen, and is less developed in the Eucnemides than in Typical Elaters : yet I 

 have never failed to detect it, on close observation. In the genera Cebrio and 

 Cerophytum it is completely wanting : the former recedes too in the prominent 

 mandibles, and the latter in the posterior femora being inserted at the extremity 

 of the elongate trochanter, instead of at its base and side, as in Elateridae and 

 most other Coleoptera. Although I have not yet detected the affinities of this 

 difficult genus, I think there can be no doubt of the propriety of entirely excluding 

 it both from the Elateridae and Cebrionidae. 



The Buprestidae are distinguished from the Elateridae by the posterior margin 

 of the prothorax beneath, abutting directly against the mesothoracic segment. 

 More distinct characters will be found in the union of the first and second inferior 

 abdominal segments : the suture between them being visible only at the side : 

 a character of great constancy is found in the form of the eyes, which are strongly 

 transverse in all Buprestidae, while they are generally round in all Elateridae. In 

 order to include the Eucnemides with the other more typical groups, the Elate- 

 ridae may be thus defined.

According to the form of the sternum and front, this family may be divided 

 into several groups, of which the first and easiest, the Eucnemides, may be dis- 

 tinguished by the clypeus expanded in front of the antennae ; the labrum con- 

 cealed: the head strongly deflexed : the presternum not lobed in front. Our 

 native genera may be arranged as follows :

I am not sure that the primary division into genera with and without tarsal 

 appendages is natural, but as I have had no opportunity of examining any genus 

 of the latter division, I do not dare to disturb the arrangement adopted by all pre- 

 vious entomologists. From considerations derived from the study of other Elaters, 

 I am inclined to think that it would be betj^er to divide this portion (B) among 

 those that precede it, putting Galba next to Eucnemis in (b.) and the foreign 

 genus Pterotarsus before Microrhagus in (c).

The insect that I consider as belonging to this genus, differs from the preced-

 joints in the male are equally enlarged, and each is about twice as long as the 

 7th joint ; the plates of the posterior coxae are suddenly dilated within, and are 

 broadly truncate at the extremity. I am unable to see the last joint of the palpi, 

 which Eschscholtz describes as ovoid.

This genus has a very great resemblance, to the last, and can only be distin-

Guerin refers this genus to the genuine Elateridae : Eriehson in Agassiz' No- 

 menclator Zoologicus places it in Cebrionidae. The form of the clypeus, how- 

 ever, forces it into the present group. The prosternum is scarcely prominent 

 behind ; the plates of the posterior coxae are suddenly dilated, by the addition 

 of a quadrangular piece.

 and by the absence of an anterior lobe on the prosternum. It seems most na- 

 tural to consider it as a special group connecting Anelastes among the Eucnemi- 

 des, with the more typical Elaters.

The Committee on the Rev. Mr. Langstroth's paper on the '' Impreg- 

 nation of the Eggs of the Queen Bee," reported in favor of publication 

 in the Proceedings. 



On the Impregnation of the Eggs of the Queen Bee, 

 By Rev. Lorenzo L. Langstroth. 



Many singular notions have prevailed respecting the generation of bees. 

 Virgil* asserted that bees have no sexual intercourse, but gather young from 

 the leaves of plants. New colonies, he thought, could be obtained from the 

 carcasses of animals. Swammerdam, in his observations on bees, made in 

 1673, proved, by careful dissection, that the bee commonly called the King, is a 

 female, and the mother of the whole colony, and that the drone is the male bee. 

 He thought that a seminal atmosphere proceeded from the drones and caused the 

 impregnation of the female, or as she is commonly called, the Queen. 



Maraldi (1712) conjectured that the eggs of the Queen were fecundated by 

 the drones after being laid in the cells. Arthur Dobbs (Philosophical Trans- 

 actions, vol. 46 for 1760) was, I believe, the first who suggested that the Queen 

 may have a sperma-theca, from the contents of which the eggs are impregnated. 

 Debraw (Phil. Transac. vol. 67 for 1777) imagined that he saw drones deposit- 

 ing semen in cells containing eggs. Both Huber and Dr. John Hunter have 

 shown that he was mistaken. The latter supports the theory of Dobbs, and 

 endeavors to strengthen it by some curious experiments which he made on the 

 impregnation of the eggs of the silk-worm. (Phil. Transac. vol. 82 for 1792.) 

 Huber* (1788) was the first to demonstrate that the sexual union of the Queen 

 and drone takes place when the insects are on the wing, in the open air ; and that 

 a Queen, when impregnated, will continue, at least for several years, to lay fertile 

 eggs without any further intercourse with the male. He thought that she was 

 impregnated for life, but he was not able even to conjecture how all the eggs in 

 her ovary could be at once fecundated. Dzierzon, a German apiarian of great 

 practical knowledge, has revived (1845) the notion of a permanently impreg- 

 nated sperma-theca. He says that he has dissected Queen bees both before and 

 after impregnation, and that he has found the seminal sac in the first case to con- 

 tain a limpid fluid like water, and in the second case to be filled with a substance 

 resembling the semen of the drone. This would seem almost to settle the 

 question; but unfortunately he advances a conjecture which seems to be at 

 variarice with the idea that he had much skill in dissecting. He thinks that 

 what is the poison sac in the worker becomes the sperma-theca sac in the 



Aristotle informs us that some cultivators called the^rulers or kings, mothers, and the 

 drones, males, 



t Hattorf and Schirach (1770) beUeved that the Queen was self-impregnated ; and 

 the latter accounted for the existence of males by conjecturing that their semen formed 

 the food of the young bee.

Queen ! Now, the poison sac, with the sting and all its appendages, is entirely 

 distinct from the sperma-theca, and can easily be recognized without the aid of 

 the microscope. He does not seem to have examined, microscopically, the fluid 

 in what he calls the seminal vesicle, in order to demonstrate, by the presence of 

 spermatozoa, that it was the semen of the male. As I am not aware that this 

 has been done by any one else, I hereby communicate to the Academy the 

 results of such an examination made last month, by Dr. Joseph Leidy of 

 this city. 



The Queen dissected was taken from an observing hive in which she had been 

 lodged in the Summer of 1851, having accompanied a first swarm from a hive 

 which had been swarmed in 1850. I am certain that she was not a Queen of 

 the current year, for she commenced ovi-depositing in the empty cells which the 

 hive contained, the same day in which she was put into it ; whereas young 

 Queens, which are not impregnated until after they are established as heads of a 

 new colony, do not begin to lay until after the lapse of several days. I know 

 that she was the same Queen lodged by me in the hive, as the bees were in a 

 hive of my own invention, in which they were exposed to the full light of day, 

 and were under constant inspection. She was therefore nearly two years old. 

 The males in this colony had all been killed in August and there was not one 

 in the hive (Jan. 27th) when she was taken from it. 



Plate XIX in Swammerdam's History of Insects, represents very accurately 

 all the parts which were particularly examined. The small globular vessel 

 (fig. 3-t.) which Swammerdam thought secreted a mucous fluid to attend the 

 eggs to the bottom of the cells, was found to be the true sperma-theca. Its 

 internal diameter was the l-33d of an inch, and it was distended with a whitish, 

 viscous fluid which, when examined by the microscope, was found to be filled 

 with spermatozoa. 



I consider, therefore, that this dissection demonstrates that the Queen bee has 

 a reservoir in which the semen of the male is lodged, and that the eggs are im- 

 pregnated as they pass by the duct leading from the sperma-theca into the 

 oviduct. 



Note. Since this paper was written. Dr. Leidy has examined two more Queen bees, 

 each of vvhicli had the sperma-theca distended with the spermatic fluid. These Queens 

 were both reared last Summer from eggs in worker combs, which were furnished to 

 colonies deprived of a Queen. The construction of the hives allowed the whole process 

 to be distinctly seen. 



Mr. Jacob Peirce exhibited a hybrid fowl, being a cross between the 

 Peacock and Guinea Hen. The specimen was one of four which had 

 been hatched and raised on the farm of Mr. David West, in Chester Co,, 

 between Kimberton and the Yellow Springs, Pa.

Dr. J. C. Fisher read the following description of the Aurora of 

 Thursday, Feb. 19th, 1852. The observations were made from an 

 elevated point on the opposite side of the Schuylkill, where the view 

 was entirely unobstructed. 



On the night of Thursday, the 1 9th of February last, a most beautiful Aurora 

 was visible throughout the middle and northern parts of the United States. 

 There were some circumstances connected with this one that seem to require a 

 more particular description than usual. The air was calm and clear. The 

 wind was light from the N. N. West. The temperature in the early part of 

 the evening was about 25 F., but it fell very rapidly, and before morning it 

 was 10 F. The Aurora began in the early part of the night with the appear- 

 ance of a bank or arch of white light, rising about 15 or 16 above the horizon. 

 This continued, with some few changes, to be its general character, till about 9 

 o'clock, when a series of remarkable and beautiful changes commenced, which, 

 with some alternations of repose, lasted till the whole was lost in the dawn of 

 day. A little after 10 o'clock it presented some of the most remarkable and 

 beautiful changes it has ever been the good fortune of the writer to witness. 

 The arch or bank of white light which formed the basis of the whole, appeared 

 suddenly to rise and expand like a huge billow, or rather like one of those huge 

 masses of foam at the bottom of the cataract of Niagara, until suddenly bursting, 

 it threw a vast volume of white spray to the zenith, where it changed to a fiery 

 red, giving rise to an alarm of fire. Instantly after streamers of red, white and 

 brown shot up from the broken arch that still formed the basis or ground work, 

 and which at the same time changed from its white color to at first a pale green, 

 and then to almost an emerald green. Soon after the streamers ceased, and 

 waves of parti-colored light rushed across the heavens from west to east, as if in 

 rapid pursuit of one another. This was soon succeeded by masses of light shoot- 

 ing up from the arch, which was again formed, to the zenith. Some of those 

 masses presented a remarkably livid appearance, and the whole formed a picture 

 which it is not in the power of language fairly to describe. During the time 

 when the auroral changes were so brilliant, the electrical state of the atmosphere 

 was in a most singularly disturbed condition. The telegraph wires were so 

 highly charged and conducted so great a quantity, that there were divers and 

 sundry rather unreadable communications written down at the various stations

throughout the country, thus establishing its electrical character beyond ques- 

 tion. Several persons have said that during the sanne time they distinctly heard 

 a snapping and cracking noise like that made by an electrical machine when in a 

 powerfully excited condition. This, however, may need confirmation. The 

 photometric power of the aurora when most brilliant, was about equal to that of 

 the moon in a very clear sky, when about three days old. ]No means were had 

 by the writer of examining the magnetic changes and disturbances. These, 

 however, have been probably carefully noted by accurate observers. From all 

 the phenomena noticed, however, the conclusion is a fair one that this aurora 

 was caused by a highly disturbed condition of the electrical tension of the air, 

 owing principally to calorific causes, and that however high it might have ex- 

 tended into the atmosphere, it undoubtedly rested upon the earth, and that in our 

 immediate vicinity. 



Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to a specimen of the body of a 

 cervical vertebra, from the Eocene formation of Ouachita, Louisiana, belonging 

 to the cabinet of the Academy. It is perfectly mineralized, and both epiphyses 

 are attached, but portions are broken away, permitting the characteristic tuber- 

 culated surface of the body to be seen. It very probably belonged to a cetacean 

 animal, and is remarkable on account of the relatively deep concavity of its sur- 

 faces before and behind. For the animal to which the vertebra belonged, the 

 name Pontogeneus priscus was proposed. 



Dr. Leidy further made some remarks upon the comparative osteology and 

 dentition of the Hippopotamus, and proposed to consider the small species, 

 H. Libeiiensis, Morton, as belonging to a new genus of Hippopotamidae, under 

 the name of Chcerodes. 



Mr. Lea called attention to a specimen of Dipsas plicatus, Leachy 

 which was very remarkable for its size. It was a single valve, and 

 measured in length 6f inches, and in breadth 10 J inches. Its weight 

 was IO5 ounces. The heaviest specimen of a Vnio known to Mr. Lea 

 weighed two pounds ten ounces. 



Mr. Lea also exhibited some specimens of Uniones, which were appa- 

 rently hybrid, but in reality not so, the discrepancy arising from acci- 

 dental causes.

A letter was read from Araory Edwards, Esq., dated New York, 

 March 3d, 1852, accompanying the donation of the heads of two 

 Gentoo Indians received this evening, of which the following is an ex- 

 tract : 



*The Gentoo tribe of Indians inhabit the sources of the Purus river, a South- 

 ern tributary of the Amazon. The marshy banks of this river render it so very 

 unhealthy that very little is known of its inhabitants. At intervals a half-breed

trader will venture up from the town of Barra, at the junction of the Annazon 

 and Negro rivers, who may be able to procure a very small quantity of Balsam 

 de Copaiba, or some gums. These traders report this tribe as inoiTensive, living 

 on fish and fruits, entirely without clothing, and killing animals with a blow gun 

 and poisoned arrows. 



The owner of one of these heads carried it with him, and when fishing, had it 

 placed with the face towards him "for luck's sake," and it is extremely rare to 

 get them to part with one. 



These are the only ones I have ever met with from this river ; those in the col 

 lection of the late Dr. Morton, presented by me, were of the tribe of Mundrucus, 

 living between the Tapajos and Madeira rivers, and one is, I think, figured in 

 the works of Spix and Von Martius."

Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to five heads lying upon the 

 table, of what were usually considered as belonging to a single species of Hip- 

 popotamus, under the name of H. amphibius. Two of the specimens are 

 from North Western Africa, and three from Southern Africa. Between those of 

 the two localities, various differences were pointed out, the most important being 

 the existence of a single band of enamel upon the upper canines of the North 

 Western Hippopotamus, and the band being divided into two by a space of three 

 lines on the outer side of the posterior groove in the Southern Hippopotamus. 

 Dr. L. therefore concluded with Desmoulins and Duvernoy, that there were two 

 distinct species of Hippopotamus, and as that of Northern Africa was the ear- 

 liest known, the name, H. amphibius should be retained for it, while that of the 

 South should retain Desmoulin's name of H. capensis. 



Dr. Le Conte mentioned that the specimens of Casteroides Ohioensis, 

 presented this evening, were important, as giving a new locality to this 

 animal. They were obtained by Dr. Feuchtwanger from a well near 

 Shawneetown, forty feet below the surface. 



Dr. Hays stated that the tooth of the fossil Tapir presented by him 

 this evening, was found in the bed of a canal in North Carolina. It 

 had been in his possession for several years, and was the first fossil 

 Tapir tooth found in North America.

Dr. Leidy called attention to the very fine skeleton of Troglodytes 

 gorilla, recently presented to the Academy by Dr. Henry A. Ford of 

 Liberia, which is now mounted and in the Hall. The height, as it now 

 stands, is four feet nine inches. 




54 [March, 



Mr. Lea made some remarks on the subject of the periodicity of the Family 

 TJniouidcB. He mentioned that some of the species matured and ejected from 

 their oviducts the perfect shell in the autumn, others in the sprintr, and some 

 apparently in the winter. He mentioned that few observations had yet been 

 made on this interesting branch of animal economy. He had himself made some 

 observations many years since on the JJniones and Anodoiitcs of our vicinity ; 

 and his brother, T. G. Lea, had, at his request, made some interesting observa- 

 tions of those in the vicinity of Cincinnati, part of which had been noted in the 

 Transactions of the American Philosophical Society. He then read part of a 

 letter from Mr. Joseph Clark of Cincinnati, in vi'hich he mentions having ob- 

 served the ))eriodicity of several species within the last six months. Th*^ Ano- 

 doiita edentiUa^ Say, was found with oviducts fully charged in September, as 

 were also JJnio ellipsis^ Lea, Z7. irroratus^ Lea, U, securis, Lea, TJ. foliauis^ 

 Hild. and TJ. orhiculatus, Hild. In October he found the ova of the JJnio multi- 

 pllcatiis, Lea, more than half developed, and thinks they would have been ma- 

 tured in the spring. In the Unio aiiodontoides, Lea, they were beautifully de- 

 veloped, and would probably have been matured and voided in the winter. The 

 oviducts of the last species are bordered with a beautiful blue color. 



Thus Mr. Clark's conclusions were the same as to the different periods of 

 various species as Mr. Lea's, and there cannot be a doubt but that the terms of 

 the species differ according to their own law.

Diam. .7, length 2.G, breadth 3.1 inches. 



This very beautiful and rare JJnio is, in form and general outline, very much 

 like the Dijysas pUcaticsy Leach, but they cannot be confounded with each other, 

 as they belong to very distinct genera, the Dipsas having but one linear tooth 

 in each valve, while the above described shell has perfectly well defined lamellar 

 cardinal teeth, double in the right and single in the left valve. It also has long, la- 

 mellar, lateral teeth, double in the left and single in the right valve. It differs also 

 in the folds, having them extending over the flattened side from the beaks, in this 

 specimen, which is not half grown, to half the length of the shell. The folds

on the wing: also differ, the Cumhigii having the row from the beak to the pos- 

 terior nnargin much nearer to the umbonial slope. The folds in the superior part 

 of the wing are smaller. This shell is very much compressed at the beaks and 

 reminds one of the Margaritana compla/iata (nobis.) 



Mr. Cuming informs me that he has received several specimens from the 

 northern part of China, and that the full grown ones are 5h inches by 6i 

 inches. I dedicate ihe specimen to my friend, Mr. Cuming, to whose kindness I 

 owe the possession of my specimen. 



The Committee on the foUowincr paper of Dr. C. M. Wetherill, re- 

 ported in favor of publicatiou in the Proceedings : 



Examination of Mohjbdate of Lpad, from Wkeatley^s Mine near Phanixville, 



Chester County^ Pennsylvania , 



By Charles M. Wetherill, Ph. D. 



The mineral was given to me by Mr. W. S. Vaux, who received it from Mr. 

 Wheatley. It was found at his mine near Phcenixville, Chester County, Pa. 

 The Molybdate occurs with Phosphate of Lead. The crystals (square tables 

 modified,) are of light red color. Lustre adamantine, translucent, streak white. 

 Before the blow-pipe on charcoal decrepitates, and fuses with reduction of lead. 

 On platinum wire with borax in the outer flame is dissolved to a trans- 

 parent glass, yellow while hot, colorless on cooling; in the inner flame, the bead 

 becomes deep brov^-n when cool. In salt of phosphorus in the outer flame, the 

 same reaction occurs as with borax ; in the inner flame the green color charac- 

 teristic of Molybdena appears. It dissolves almost completely in nitric acid, 

 and in hydrochloric with a residue of chloride of lead ; these solutions are yellow. 

 Hardness between selenite and calc spar, or between two and three of Mohs' 

 scale. Density ascertained with one gramme of the crystals 5-6. 



A portion of the crystals was analyzed in the moist way by dissolving in boil- 

 ins: dilute hydrochloric acid, and separating the crystals of chloride of lead, 

 which form on cooling. These crystals were not completely soluble in boiling 

 water, but left a residue in small quantity, apparently silica. The solution fil- 

 tered from the chloride of lead, treated with sulphuretted hydrogen, gave a dark 

 brown precipitate, composed of the sulphurets of lead and molybdenum, the latter 

 was dissolved from the lead by hydrosulphuret of ammonia. The filtrate from the 

 sulph. hydrogen precipitate contained a trace of iron. 



I was not able to detect chromium either by Ihe moist way or before the blow- 

 pipe. The earths and alkaline earths were also absent. 



I am not aware that a red molybdate of lead of American locality has been 

 described. 



The following resolution was unanimously adopted : 



Resolved, That a copy of the Proceedings, as far as published^ be pre- 

 sented to Dr. Henry A. Ford, of Liberia, Africa, in return for his re- 

 cent valuable contributions to the Academy, from that country. 



Dr. Elwyn offered the following, which was adopted : 



Rcsolvedj That a Committee be appointed to communicate with Com- 

 modore Perry, in relation to making collections of objects of Natural 

 History in India, by the IT. S. Expedition which is to sail shortly 

 for that station.

 ferred to Mr. Cassin, Dr. AYoodhouse and Dr. LeConte. 



Dr. Woodhouse read a paper, intended for publication in the Pro-

 while attached to the late U. S. Expedition under Captain L. Sitgreaves, 

 for exploring the Zuni and Colorado Rivers of the West. Referred to 

 Col. McCall, Mr. Cassin and Dr. Wilson. 



Dr. LeConte offered the following additional remarks on some 

 fovssil Pachyderms, from Illinois, referred to on page 3 of the present, 

 volume : 



Having recently had an opportunity of inspecting an entire skull in the pos- 

 session of Dr. Leidy, closely allied to, if not identical with the craniuna described 

 by me as Hyops, and afterwards as Dicotyles depressifrons, I have the satisfac- 

 tion of being able to arrange this confusing nnixture of bones in a natural man- 

 ner. I have seen distinctly that the parts described as belonging to the upper 

 jawof Platygonus compressus, in reality belong to Hyops, but that the singularly 

 dilated lower jaw associated with them, is part of another animal for which the 

 name Platygonus must be retained. The large inferior canine referred to Dico- 

 tyles depressifrons is perhaps the canine of the genus with dilated jaw ; at any 

 rate, it cannot belong to Hyops, and until the canine of Platygonus is found in 

 situ, it would be more natural to consider it as not indicating a third animal, of 

 which no other trace remains. 



The inferior molars and canine from another locality, on which the genus 

 Protochcerus was founded, also belong to Hyops. In palliation of this blunder, I 

 may say, that the cranium end superior canines and molars of Hyops were asso- 

 ciated with no lower teeth except those in the fragment of dilated jaw, which 




1852.]

^ 



certainly seemed to accord very closely in size and shapt? with the upper jaw. 

 Any one who has observed the very close correspondence between the dentition 

 of suiline pachyderms, and the great variation in different portions of the dental 

 series, w-ll appreciate the difficulty of apportioning properly small fraiiments of 

 closely allied species, and will excuse the faults which I have unconsciously 

 committed. As the best reparation for these errors, I subjoin the following 

 synonyms of the fiagmcnts of the head, described by me :

Mt. Lea stated some of his views .regarding species, and mentioned that the 

 subject had engaged the attention of eminent naturalists, some of whom had given 

 definitions, which did not fulfil his idea of what constituted that term. Lindley, 

 in his Introduction to Botany, has given some very judicious and philosophic 

 views on classification. " Species," he says, " are created by Nature hersell, 

 and remain always the same in whatever manner they may be combined ; they 

 form the basis of all classification, and are the only part of it which can be con- 

 sidered absolute." In this he makes no attempt to define his ideas of species. It 

 is assumed to be a distinct creation, and unchangeable. 



MM. Ray and Drouet (" Revue et Mag. de Zoologie, 1849 "') give their views 

 of what forms a species, in the following terms : " Generalement on entend, par 

 ce mot, (espece) un type d'organization de forme et d'activite, rigoureusement 

 determine, qui se perpetue successivement par generation directe et d'une ma- 

 niere indefinie avec la meme Constance de caracteres." 



Milne Edwards' definition of species, Mr. Lea thought was less clear. He says, 

 " On donne le nom d'espece a la reunion des individus, que se reproduisent entre 

 eux avec les memes proprietes essentielles." 



Cuvier considered that the fact of the succession, and of the constant succes- 

 sion, constituted alone the validity of the species. 



Dr. Morton comprised his view of species, as "a primordial organic form." 



Neither of these definitions fulfil Mr. Lea's idea of what forms a species. It 

 seemed tohim,that a species must be considered to hez. primcay estaUished lati\ 

 stamped with a persistent form pertaining solely to itself, with the power of 

 successively reproducing the same form, and none other. 



Mr. Lea also stated he was about to issue a new edition of his Synopsis of thg 

 Family Naiades, with much additional matter. That in the introductory part, 

 he had given the classification of various zoologists, and among others those who 

 had divided the Naiades by their anatomical differences, viz: D'Orbigny, Tro- 

 schel, and Agassiz. In these he said it would be observed, by consulting the 

 works of the two first, and a work entitled " Shells of New England," by Mr. 



*The figures of these leeth were sn ban' I y drawn by the artist engaged by nie, and 

 still farther deteriorated and altered while in the hands of Mr. Endicoir, that the minute 

 differences which distinguish such cloFr'y allird nrvrrials are not lo be seen : in excuse 

 for permitting such figures to go before llie uur.d, I must say that the memoir was 

 printed during my absence on a scieatifie expedition, and that no opp(<rtunity was offered 

 for correcting the proof. 




58 [April, 



W. Stimpson, who cites Prof. Agassiz's MSS., that they do not differ essentially 

 in their modes of division. Mr. Lea farther remarked, that our knowledge of 

 the structural differences of the soft parts of these animals, he thought, was not 

 sufficiently advanced to found a perfect and permanent system. That such a one 

 would be instituted he had no doubt, as he had expressed himself in 1838, in a note 

 on Anodonta BlainviUia?ia, in the second edition of his Synopsis, p. 31, and he 

 trusted, that the able physiologists above cited would continue their investisa- 

 tions; but he was disposed to think that, until zoologists had examined carefully 

 the soft parts of most of the existing numerous species, the exo-skeletons* 

 (so to call them) of which have only come under our notice the facilities which 

 a good system ought to afford, cannot be reaped by a partial anatomical know- 

 ledge, which does not now embrace probably one eighth of the ascertained spe- 

 cies of the family. Besides, he was not at all disposed to think, that we can en- 

 tirely dispense with the aid we find in the various characters of the exo-skele- 

 tons in making out subgroups. They often, indeed, afford striking and obvious 

 differences, which the eye schooled with but little experience, can with facility 

 and certainty detect, and which if happily grouped by an experienced eye may 

 greatly aid the student. These considerations had induced him still to retain 

 nearly the same divisions in the new edition of the Synopsis, which had been 

 used in the last one.

Dr. Leidy read a paper entitled '^ Characteristics of some new Rep- 

 tiles in the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution, by Spencer F. 

 Baird and Charles Grirard;" which, being intended for publication in 

 the Proceedings, was referred to a Committee consisting of Dr. Hal- 

 lowell. Dr. LeConte and Dr. Leidy. 



Dr. Leidy also presented a paper from Prof. Dana, being a continu- 

 ation of his descriptions of the Crustacea of the Exploring Expedition 3 

 which was referred to the original Committee. 



Dr. Leidy read also a paper ^'On the Osteology of the Head of the Hip-

 Genus of Hippopotamidse," which being intended for publication in the 

 Journal, was referred to Dr. Ruschenberger, Dr. Woodhouse and Dr. 

 Hallowell. 



Dr. Leidy stated that he had been studying the characters of the fossil tortoises 

 from Nebraska Territory, and had come to the conclusion that they had been 

 terrestrial and not aquatic in their habits,and belonged to the genus Testudo. In all, 

 the penultimate vertebral plate is inverted Vformed,enclosing with the pygal plate 

 the last vertebral plate ; the costal plates are alternately broad and narrow ; and 

 in those specimens in which the marks of the pygal scute remains, it is undivided, 

 as in the recent Testudo. The names of those species described recently should 

 be changed as follows :

Dr. L. also called the attention of the members to a specimen of " Red Snow " 

 Protococcus nivalis, beneath the microscope, which was brought by Dr. E. K. 

 Kane, U. S. N., from the Arctic region. It consists of simple, spherical vesi- 

 cles, with a transparent, colorless, shining cell wall, and bright red, granular 

 contents. The vesicles or cells measure from the i-1750th to the l-777th of 

 an inch in diameter.

Descriptions of new species of Biyds of the genera Virco, Vieill.f and Zo?^o- 



trichiaf Stvains . 



By S. W. Woodhouse, M. D. 



The specimens described in the present paper were procured by me in Texas, 

 whilst attached to the expedition under the command of Captain L. Sitgreaves, 

 Topographical Engineer U. S. Army, which explored the rivers Zuni and Colo- 

 rado of the West. 



Vireo atricapilla, nobis. 



Form. Robust, wings short and slightly rounded, first quill short, third long- 

 est; tail extending about one inch beyond the closed wings. 



Dimensions. Total length, 4 5-10, extent of wings, 71, from flexure, 2 1-10, 

 length of tail 1 6-10 inches. 



Colors. Head above black, which color extends over the cheeks and ears to 

 the base of the lower mandible ; a white ring encircles the eye, and then forms 

 a broad band extending to the nares. The plumage of the back is dark olive 

 green, slightly tipped with black, and gradually becoming lighter over the rump 

 and tail-coverts. Wings and tail dark brown, inclining to black, with their 

 outer margin light olive ; greater and lesser wing-coverts broadly tipped with 

 dingy white. 



The primaries have a white line extending along their inner edge. Throat, 

 belly, and feet white. Sides very light yellow. Iris bright red. Bill, tarsi and 

 feet, black. 



Habitat. Western Texas. 



Obs. I procured this bird on the 26th of May, 1851, on the Rio San Pedro, 

 two hundred and eight miles from San Antonio, on the road leading from that 

 place toEl Paso del Norte. 



I was first attracted by its singular note, which I am unable to imitate. It 

 was feeding in the dense cedars, and resembled in its habits our Sylvias, being 

 continually in motion, which rendered it rather diflicult to shoot. I procured 

 two specimens, both of which, on dissection, proved to be males. 



Zonotrichia Cassinii^ nobis. 



Form. Bill slender and conical, with a well marked ridge between the nos- 

 trils, extending about half way down the bill ; wings short and rounded, first 

 quill shortest, third and fourth about equal. Tail long and rounded. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail 5 5 10 inches, 

 wing from flexure 2 6-10 inches. Tail extending beyond the closed wings about 

 1 5-10 inches. Total length, 2 5-10 inches. Bill along the ridge 5i-10 inches. 

 From gap to tip 5-10 inch ; tarsus IJ-IO inches. 



Colon. Head and back cinereous brown; throat and breast very light cine- 

 rous brown ; sides light brown, with longitudinal brown stripes next the shafts, 

 and at their extremities and the surrounding portions of the feather, brownish 

 white. Belly and vent dingy white, a strip of dingy white^extending from the 

 base of the upper mandible, over and behind the eye. Primaries brown, with 

 their outer edges light brown ; secondaries and scapulars brown, with a white- 

 ened band encircling them ; wing at the flexure light yellow; the tail, with 

 the exception of the two middle feathers, brown, tipped with white, the mid- 

 dle feathers light brown and slightly barred; in the outer feathers the white 




1852.] , 61 



extends from the shaft along the outer side ; upper mandible light brown, lower 

 light yellow. Tarsus and feet flesh colored ; iris dark brown. 

 Habitat. Western Texas. 



Obs. This interesting bird I shot on the prairie near San Antonio, on the 25th 

 of April, 1851, and, at the time, took it for the Z. savanna (Wilson,) which it 

 much resembled in ' its habits, but upon examination it proved to be totally 

 distinct. I found but one specimen, which is a male. 



I have named this in honor of my friend Mr. John Cassin, the Corresponding 

 Secretary of this Society, to vv'hose indefatigable labor in the department of 

 Ornithology we are so much indebted.

Note 071 Carpodacus frontalis, (^Say,) with descriptiotv of a new species of the same 



ge?i7is, from Santa Fe, New Mexico. 



By Col. George A. McCall, U. S. A. 



In the Proceedings of this Academy for the months of May and June, 1851, 

 was published some account of such Birds as I had met with during the preced- 

 ing year in Texas and New Mexico. In that paper, under the name oiCarpoda- 

 cus frontalis. Say, I gave an account of the habits of a bird I had found at 

 Santa Fe. 



At the time I first observed the bird to which I allude, I believed it to be of 

 a species not previously described, and I brought \\\t\\ me from New Mexico 

 specimens of the adult birds, the young, the nest and the eggs. But on my ar- 

 rival in this city, a comparison with C. frontalis resulted in the decision that 

 my specimens were of that species ; they were accordingly presented to the 

 Academy as such, together with an account of their habits. Recently, however, 

 my attention has been called to these birds (a close examination of them having 

 been made by Dr. Wilson and Mr. Cassin) and a satisfactory conclusion has 

 been arrived at, that the birds referred to do not belong to the s'^ecies frontalis, 

 but are of a species not previously described ; I therefore propose the name fami- 

 liaris, and annex hereto an accurate description which w^as taken from an ex- 

 amination of a number of specimens, killed at Santa Fe in the spring of 1850. 



~Carj)odacns familiaris .* 



Adult male. Front, sides of head, chin, throat and rump, crimson; crow^n, 

 hind-neck and fore part of back, brownish crimson passing into brown on the 

 after part of the back ; fore part of the breast brownish crimson fading into light 

 dusky brown on the abdomen, which, with the under tail coverts, is striped wath 

 blackish brown ; wungs and tail, dusky brown, each feather edged with pale 

 brown, which is broadest on the wing coverts ; bill robust and curved on the 

 ridge, and together with the legs and feet dark dusky; iris black. Length, six 

 inches one line, alar extent ten inches ; wdng from the flexure three and a quar- 

 ter inches. 



The female, (in size rather less than the male,) is above, of a dusky brown 

 edged with light brown ; beneath, pale brown longitudinally striped with dark 

 brown ; wings and tail dusky, edged with pale brown. The young on the first 

 of May were nearly full fledged, and were similar in color to the female, though 

 lighter. 



It will be seen from the foregoing description that the present species differs 

 from C. frontalis in having the crimson less decidedly defined that color being 

 diff'used over a greater part of the body, and gradually fading into brown.

 of Reptiles, reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings. 



Descrlptio7i of netif species of Keptilia from Western Africa* 

 By Edward Hallowell, M. D. 

 PHRACTOGONUS,* Halloivell. 



Snbgeneric Characters. Head conical, presenting two large plates upon its 

 upper surface. Nostrils below the rostral. A row of longitudinal shields upon 

 the chest. Body and tail annulated ; lateral pores near the anus. 



Phractogonus gahatus. 



Specific Characters. Five teeth in the lower jaw on each side ; four maxillary 

 on each side of the upper jaw, and two intermaxillary teeth; two large plates upon 

 the head; lateral pores near the anus; pectoral shields four in number, long 

 and narrow; two hundred and fourteen rings upon the body, eighteen upon the 

 tail. 



Description. The head is small and somewhat triangular, rounded in front. 

 It presents upon its upper surface two large plates, one of which forms the ros- 

 tral. The posterior of these is much the larger, and is more extended 

 transversely than in its antero-posterior diameter. It presents three 

 distinct margins anteriorly, its posterior margin being somewhat 

 rounded ; its superior surface is convex. The rostral is rounded an- 

 teriorly, depressed above ; its anterior margin presents an acute edge. 

 The snout extends nearly a line beyond the mouth. In an angle formed by the 

 plates just described, on each side of the head, is one which is narrow and 

 oblong ; and immediately behind it another very small and quadrilateral ; behind 

 this at the angle ofthe mouth is a triangular plate, its base presenting back- 

 ward ; between them at the posterior part of the head are four narrow and 

 more or less oblong and two smaller ones. The nostrils are 

 quite small, V shaped, a line apart, and are situated upon the under 

 part of the snout, in a narrow plate immediately behind the 

 rostral. The eyes are not visible. Five labial plates margin the 

 upper jaw on each side. There are three upon the margin of the lower 

 jaw', tfe posterior of which is very large and quadrilateral. The mental 

 plate is also large, with a rounded posterior margin. The pectoral shields 

 are four in number, the two middle ones by their junction forming a tri- 

 angle superiorly. They are each about three lines and three-fourths in length, 

 and a line in breadth. The two lateral shields, which are pentagonal, have their 

 /^.ys. bases precisely in aline with those of the intermediate plates. Im- 

 /\X-J\ mediately above the two middle pectoral are two small quadrilateral 

 J r T ones about a line in breadth ; their external and inferior margin is 

 j I "in contact with the superior and internal margin of the long and 



' V I J / narrow external pectoral shields. There are nine semicircular 

 rings upon the upper part of the body terminating at the base ofthe 

 pectoral plates. There are 214 rings upon the body, and 18 upon the tail. 

 Body slender, cylindrical, fifteen lines in circumference at its middle, of an 

 obscure white color : (the specimen has been preserved in alcohol). The back 

 of the animal is covered with numerous small quadrangular scuta, looking 

 ^ I j j-p, like mosaic : they are wider apart upon the abdomen, which has a 

 V' '^JJ.^Jtg/ smooth appearance. No longitudinal sulci are observed upon the body. 

 There are two lateral pores quite distinct, each in a separate scale 

 on the left side of the row of pmnanal scales, and one near the centre of a scale 

 on the right ofthe same row. The scales in front ofthe anus are six in riumber, 

 the two middle ones oblons; and quadrilateral, the lateral ones irregular in shape. 

 Biviensioiis. Length of head Ah lines, of neck and body 13 inches (Fr.) 10 

 lines, of tail l-Oi lines.

Habits. But little is known of the habits of this animal. They probably re- 

 semble those of the Amphisba'nidcT. 



General Remarks. But three species of Lepidosternon are described by Dume- 

 ril and Bibron in their Erpetologie Generale, viz., Lep. microcephalum, L. 

 phocaena, and L. scutigerum. From the microcephalum, the species upon which 

 the genus was founded by Spix, galeatus differs in the form and number of the 

 pectoral shields, the number of plates upon the head, and in being a much more 

 slender animal. Lepidosternon phocaena presents twelve plates upon the head, and 

 the pectoral shields are small and lozenge shaped. The resemblance between the 

 animal just described and the L. scutigerum, the Cephalopeltis Cuvieri of Muller, 

 is more close, but it differs from it in several well marked particulars, viz., the 

 position of the nostrils, which in all the species described by Dumeril and Bibron 

 are stated to be in the rostral plate. They are distinctly so drawn in the figure of 

 the L. microcephalum of Spix, in his work on the serpents of Brazil. In L. galeatus 

 the nostrils are situated in a plate immediately below the rostral. It differs also 

 in having lateral anal pores, which are not mentioned as existing in either of the 

 described species of Lepidosternon, and in the number of rings upon the body 

 and tail. These are stated by Dumeril and Bibron to be three hundred and four- 

 teen for the body and fourteen or fifteen for the tail. The L. scutigerum is there- 

 fore a much longer animal, measuring 18! inches. All the species of Lepidos- 

 ternon hitherto described are from South America. 



The reptile most nearly resembling the above described animal is undoubtedly 

 the Monaspis capensis of Dr. Andrew Smith, (Illustrations of the Zoology of 

 South Africa. Keptilia, pi. 67.) The nostrils in the plate of Dr. Smith are 

 placed as in Phractogonus, but no mention is made of his description of lateral 

 anal pores. The number of rings upon the body is 206, of the tail 7. The 

 prfeanal scale is divided as in L. galeatus into six compartments, and the pectoral 

 shields are the same in number but differ in shape. The head, however, has but 

 a single plate or shield, and hence the name Monaspis, which cannot with pro- 

 priety be applied to an animal with two. I therefore prefer the name Phracto- 

 gonus. The greater or less number of plates upon the head may, as Dr. Smith 

 observes, be of specific importance only, but the position of the nostrils and the 

 presence of lateral anal pores are characters of sufficient value to warrant the 

 establishment of a subgenus. 



Hemic ACT YLUS angulatus. 



Specific Characters. Upper part of body co^'ered with tubercles, dis- 

 posed in oblique parallel rows converging toward the middle line of 

 the back. A large triangular plate under the chin. Tail of same 

 length as head and body. Tail subquadrangular at its base, tapering 

 gradually towards a point. 



Description. The head of this animal is of moderate size, flattened above, 

 somewhat swollen at the temples. The snout is triangular, depressed abovp, 

 the nostrils which are small and circular being: placed nearly a line apart about 

 half a line above the opening of the mouth. There is a row of nine or ten plates 

 upon each side of the upper jaw; of these the two or three nearest the snout 

 appear to be the largest. The same number exists upon each side of the lower 

 jaw. The nostril is in a narrow, oblong, quadrilateral plate. The mental plate is 

 large and triangular, with two smaller quadrangular plates on each side at the 

 apex of the trians^le. The meatus auditorius is very distinct, of moderate size, 

 oval in shape. The eyes are large and lateral, with rounded pupils. The upper 

 half of the orbit is bordered by a single row of conical scales. The chin and 

 throat are covered with small granular scales, which are somewhat larger near the 

 chin. The scales upon the neck and abdomen are smooth and quadrangular, 

 running in oblique rows. The upper part of the body presents numerous tuber- 

 cles arranged in oblique rows, converging toward the middle line of the back* 

 The interspaces between the tubercles are covered with very numerous black 

 points. Upon the head and neck, numerous tubercles, larger and more abundant 

 upon the neck, are observed, arranged in an irregular manner. The upper and 

 lateral surfaces of the snout are covered with tubercles thickly agglomerated. 




64 [April, 



A well marked depression exists upon the snout and upper part of the head. 

 There are thirteen or fourteen femoral pores in the specimen examined, but no 

 pores immediately in front of the anus. Three or four of these pores extend 

 beyond the thigh on each side about a line in front of the anus. The under sur- 

 face of the extremities is covered with small imbricated scales, which are very 

 minutely punctated with black. The under part of the fingers is provided with 

 a double row of imbricated scales divided by a median line. The upper surface of 

 the tail presents numerous scattered tubercles, the under surface transverse scuta, 

 somewhat indistinct. 



Coloration. Upper part and sides of head yellowish. Upper part of body 

 light chocolate color, with numerous minute points of black ; upper surface of 

 extremities of a lighter color than rest of body. Under part of body and extre- 

 mities light straw color. 



Dimensions Length of head eight lines ; greatest breadth five lines. Length 

 of body one inch and a half (Fr.) ; of tail two inches. 



Geographical distribution. \^ est coast of Africa. 



Remarks. This species differs from all the species of Hemidactylus described 

 by Dumeril and Bibron. It is well characterized by the angular plate at the 

 chin and the disposition of the rows of tubercles upon the back. 



AcONTiAS elegans. 

 Specific Characters. No inferior eyelid; two internasal plates, 

 pentagonal, articulating with the rostral; frontal heptagonal, broader 

 than long; an interparietal hexagonal, more extended transversely 

 than antero-posteriorly ; an occipital plate larger than either of the 

 others, hexagonal, its supero-external margin hollowed ; a parietal 

 plate, a fronto-parietal, one supra-ocular, two posterior-oculars; a fre- 

 nal, and a freno-orbitar much smaller than the frenal. 



Bescriftion. The head ot this animal is small, depressed, triangular in shape 

 above, rounded in front; the rostral plate encloses the extremity of the snout and 

 presents a slit on each side posteriorly, extending backward and inferiorly in a 

 curved direction to its posterior border; immediately above the rostral are two 

 internasal plates, pentagonal, their inferior margin articulating with the posterior 

 margin of the rostral ; the frontal, interparietal and occipital form a longitudinal 

 row nearly equal in size, upon the middle and upper part of the head. The in- 

 ternasal articulate with each other by their narrowest or internal margin, with 

 the frontal, the frenal and the first labial; the frontal with the internasal, the 

 interparietal, the freno-orbitar and the supra-ocular ; the interparietal with the 

 supra-ocular ; and the fronto-parietal with the frontal anteriorly and the occi- 

 pital posteriorly ; the occipital articulates in front with the interparietal, later- 

 ally on each side with the parietal and the fronto-parietal ; the parietal are oblong, 

 inequilateral, longer from behind forward than in the opposite direction ; the 

 fronto-parietal are hexagonal, larger than the parietal ; the supra-ocular are also 

 hexagonal; the frenal plate is quadrangular articulating with the internasal, the 

 frontal, the supra-ocular, the freno-orbitar and the first labial. The eyes are 

 distinct but without an eyelid. They are situated in an interspace formed by five 

 scales, and covered by a scale a very little larger than the eye; the inferior of 

 the five is the second supra-labial. Three plates margin the upper jaw on each 

 side ; there are three upon the lower ; the most anterior of the upper row is 

 quite large, presenting an acute angle forward and upward. The plate upon the 

 under jaw, immediately behind the mental, is long and narraw ; the nostrils are 

 small, oval, nearly a line apart: immediately behind the mental is a transversely 

 elongated triangular plate, the apex of the triangle presenting backward. Body 

 slender, flattened below ; tail long, covered at its extremity with minute trape- 

 zoidal scales ; body and tail covered with smooth imbricated scales above and 

 below: their posterior margin is convex, and they have a striated appearance, 

 each scale having from two to five whitish striae ; the striation on the under sur- 

 face ; is quite remarkable ; a single scale in front of the anus. There are twenty 

 longitudinal rows of scales around the body. Tongue oval, covered with nu- 

 merous small papilla-, slightly bifid at its extremity. Marginal teeth very 




1852.] ^5 



small ; no teeth in the palate, which is also without a longitudinal groove ; no 

 meatus audilorius externus visible. 



Coloratioji. Above dark chestnut color, the edges of the scales bordered with 

 ash color, giving the whole a tesselated appearance ; under part of abdomen and 

 tail same color, but brighter ; chin, snout, upper and under jaw yellow. 



Dimensions. Length of head 4 lines, greatest breadth 2 lines. Length of 

 head and body 5 inches (Fr.) ; of tail 2 inches 4 lines. 



Geograpliical distrihulion. Liberia, West Coast of Africa. 



General Remarks. This animal has a general resemblance to the Acontias 

 meleagris of Cuvier, the only species of Acontias hitherto described, but it 

 differs from it in many important particulars, several of which beeome evident 

 even upon a superficial examination. Thus it is only necessary to compare the 

 plates of the head with the figure of them given in the filty-eighth plate of Du- 

 meril and Bibron, to perceive at once that it is not the same animal. The A. me- 

 leajiris is also larger, measuring 9! inches (Fr.) ; but the tail is nearly an inch 

 shorter, measuring 1^ inches. It differs also in having an inferior eyelid, which 

 elegans has not ; and in the form of the eye, which in meleagris resembles a 

 longitudinal slit, but which in elegans is circular. The longitudinal fissure in the 

 posterior part of the rostral plate is straight in meleagris, in elegans it is 

 curved; meleagris presents a longitudinal groove in the palate, elegans has 

 none; the scales upon the body are hexagonal in meleagris, in elegans they 

 are trapezoidal. The number of rows of scales differs in the two animals. In 

 the one there are but fourteen, in the other twenty. 



The species of reptiles just described, with a beautiful specimen of Onycho- 

 cephalus Liberiensis, were presented to the Academy by Dr. Henry A. Ford of 

 Liberia, the gentleman to whom we are also indebted for the magnificent skele- 

 ton of Troglodytes gorilla, the largest known Troglodyte.

Remarks on some Coleofterous insects collected by S. TV. Woodhoicse, M. jD., in 



Missouri Territory and New Mexico. 



By John L. LeConte, M. D. 



The collection of insects made by Dr. Woodhouse, to whom science is so 

 much indebted for extensive researches on the natural history of the regions 

 west of the Mississippi, consists chiefly of species from the boundary of the 

 tract of land which the liberal policy of our Government has set apart for the 

 Creek Indians, and were procured while he was attached to a surveying party 

 under Capt. Sitgreaves, of the Topog. Corps. The bulk of the collection made 

 in Texas and in New Mexico, has unfortunately been lost in the acccidents to 

 which the traveller is so frequently subjected in those wild and dangerous 

 regions. The few, however, that remain, are of such interest as to cause us 

 doubly to regret the destruction of the rest, and fervently to hope that the in- 

 dustry of future travellers may soon repair these unavoidable losses.

Cicindela blanda var. /S. Lee. Ann. Lye. 4, 180. 



I found several specimens of this elegant species on the Arkansas river, and 

 have heretofore considered it as a variety of C. blanda Dej. After further ex- 




66 [April, 



amination I am convinced that it must be considered as distinct. It is closely- 

 allied to C. blanda, but is less elongated in its form, and the elytra, although 

 cylindrical, are not so convex. The labrum is short, and, as in C. blanda, the 

 teeth of the anterior edge are obsolete ; the palpi are pale, with the tips brassy 

 green. The thorax is very finely, not densely wrinkled ; the sides are more 

 rounded than in C. blanda, although as in that species, they are less convex in 

 the female. The elytra are of a brilliant copper-color, more coarsely and dense- 

 ly punctured than in C. blanda. The markings are as in C. blanda, but very 

 broad, and the upper part of the medial fascia is less tortuous. The elytra of 

 the female is strongly excised on the outer edge near the tip, precisely 

 as in C. blanda. The body beneath is greenish bronze, covered with fine dense 

 white hair ; the posterior trochanters are testaceous. 



The insect that I have considered as C. blanda var. y must also be separated 

 as a distinct species under the name.

One male, Canootche river, Georgia. The diagnosis enables this species to 

 be distinguished from the preceding and from C. blanda. The color is dull, 

 without any metallic gloss. The elytra are less cylindrical and less convex, and 

 the markings are so broad that the interstices between them are reduced to nar- 

 row fuscous lines ; the punctures of the dark parts of the elytra are large and 

 dense, but not deep. The tibiae are pale, with the tip darker ; the posterior tarsi 

 are more than one-fourth longer than in C. blanda. The body beneath is black, 

 covered with short, dense white hair. 



2. Cicindela cumatilis Lee. Ann. Lye. 5, 173. 



A variety of this beautiful species was found with the spots much larger than 

 in the type, so that the medial band attains the margin, and is only interrupted 

 on the disc : the spot anterior to the apical lunule is also enlarged, and there is 

 a very minute white humeral dot. 



3. C i cind e 1 a n. sp. 



A very small species, probably allied to C. germanica, indicated only by a 

 single elytron. The markings are so different from any other species within 

 our territory, that a description of even this fragment will enable the species to 

 be easily recognized. 



The color is brownish black, without metallic lustre ; the surface is sericeous 

 with fine granulations ; the punctures are distant, large and deep ; the humeral 

 lunule is very narrow ; the oblique posterior part is curved ; the margin is 

 white, interrupted only at the apical lunule ; the anterior band perpendicular, 

 and united to the margin externally, descending slightly at its inner part, and 

 terminating in a small spot near the suture ; the margin along the apical lunule 

 is finely serrate, and obliquely attenuated almost to the tip, which is very 

 suddenly rounded, and almost truncate ; the suture is armed with a very mi- 

 nute spine.

 dance on the banks of the Gila near the Pimas villages. Dr. Woodhouse 

 took it on the Creek Boundary, and Mr. Pease brought a specimen from 

 Mexico. ' ,

Creek Boundarj^. This species is allied to C. tricolor, nemoralis, vicinus, &c., 

 but the punctures on the thorax are very small and alnnost obliterated. The 

 labrum is wide, scarcely emarginate ; the head is bright blue, very finely punc- 

 tulate and wrinkled; the thorax is blueish, wider than long, at the apex nar- 

 rower than at the base; very much rounded on the sides anteriorly ; the base 

 is truncate ; the angles obtuse, not rounded ; the disc scarcely convex, finely 

 and very obsoletely punctured; the basal impressions long and shallow. The 

 elytra are wider than the thorax, dull black; the striae are deeply punctured 

 nearly to the tip ; the interstices are slightly convex, and very finely punc- 

 tured. The first three joints of the antennae, the palpi and the legs are ferru- 

 ginous. 



6. Euryderus zabroides Lee. An. Lye. 4, 152, tab. 8, fig. 5. 

 The genus Eurydera Lap. seems to be founded upon good characters, although 



it was for a long time refused by entomologists. Its adoption requires a change 

 of name for my genus, and in allusion to the singular form of .the anterior tibiae, 

 I give Nothopus as the new generic name. 



7. Calosoma externum. Carabus externns Say. J. Ac. Nat. Sc. 3, 

 150: Lee. An. Lye. 4, 445. Calosoma longipemie Dej. Sp. Gen. 5, 568. This 

 insect after all, seems to be a genuine Calosoma, by the structure of the antennae 

 and palpi. I have seen specimens without wings, but extensive observation has 

 convinced me this is to be considered as accidental. Its form is more similar 

 to Carabus than any other species of Calosoma. 



8. Euphoria melancholica Schaum. An. Ent- Soc. Fr. 2d ser. 2, 

 374. A specimen from New Mexico has the thorax and elytra much less punc- 

 tured than the Louisiana specimens, but I can find nothing worthy of being con- 

 sidered as a specific difference.

A fine species, abundant in every part of Missouri Territory and easily dis- 

 tinguished by its sulcate elytra. Head punctured. Thorax a little wider than 

 long, rounded on the sides, narrowed behind ; moderately convex, sparsely 

 punctured, anterior angles prominent acute, base truncate. Elytra more 

 than twice as wide as the thorax, elongate oval, depressed on the disc, 

 deflexed at the apex, which is acute ; the lateral margin obtuse ; striag broad, 

 deep and obtuse, rough with elevated points ; interstices not wider than the 

 striae, convex, marked each with a single series of distant punctures; epipleurae 

 less deeply striate than the disc. Anterior thighs armed with a short, sharp 

 tooth. The female differs by having the elytra broader and less acute at 

 the tip.

A very imperfect specimen from the Creek boundary, which is distinguished 

 from another Southern species having a yellow abdomen, by its much larger 

 size, more punctured head and thorax, and immaculate black feet. I am in- 

 clined to believe that the color of the abdomen is a sexual character as in the 

 European M. subdipterus.

most parallel behind ; margin behind the middle with a yellow spot. Elytra 

 less convex at the base than in A. pulchella, with rows of large points, becom- 

 ing striae behind the middle ; interstices with a single series of small distant 

 punctures ; the ordinary yellow bands are more numerous, and those before the 

 middle are confluent, so oidy the suture, a large humeral spot and a transverse 

 spot one fourth way from the base, remain bronzed. The two posterior fasciffi 

 are oblique ; the anterior one of them includes a small marginal spot ; the tip is 

 yellow. Beneath immaculate, bronzed, punctured. Varies with the anterior spot 

 of the elytra large and confluent with the suture.

I take great pleasure in dedicating this fine species, to the enterprising travel- 

 ler to whom we owe its discovery. 



Body coppery-bronze, varied with bluish reflections, moderately stout and 

 convex ; head strongly punctured, with three faint confluent elevated lines on 

 the front, labrum green ; thorax cribrate, more than twice as broad as long, nar- 

 rowed in front, very strongly rounded on the sides, narrowed a little towards 

 the posterior angles, which are rectangular and sharp. Elytra with rows of 

 large points, and with numerous deep impressed subconfluent spaces, which are 

 opake, densely punctured and finely pubescent ; tip entire. Legs green bron- 

 zed, knees, tip of the tibiae, and tarsi steel blue. Tip of the abdomen of the 

 male very slightly truncate ; of the female rounded. 



13. Pristilophus puncticollis, niger, nitidus, thorace antrorsum 

 subangustato, lateribus confertim, disco minus dense punctato, elytris crenato-

This species is tolerably abundant in every part of Missouri Territory. It is 

 closely allied to P. m o r i o Germ. Zeitsch. 4, 85, but the elytral strias are not so 

 deep, and the interstices are but very slightly convex. Head strongly punctur- 

 ed. Thorax longer than wide, somewhat narrowed in front, slightly rounded on 

 the sides, which are strongly margined ; disc moderately punctured, sides very 

 densely punctured, scarcely impressed towards the anterior angles, posterior 

 angles slightly diverging. Elytra as wide as the thorax, striae punctured, not 

 deeply impressed, intertices scarcely convex, finely and irregularly punctured. 



14. Arhopalus charus, Lee. Journ. Ac. Nat. Sci. 2d ser. 2, 17. 

 Among those brought by Dr. Woodhouse is a variety, in which the yellow tip 

 of the elytra is much larger, inclosing a black spot.

Letters were read : 



From Commander H. F. Adams, U. S. N., dated Philadelphia, 

 April 20th, 1852, addressed to Dr. Ruschenberger, acknowledging the 

 receipt of a copy of his ''Notice of the Academy of Natural Sciences,^' 

 and expressing his desire to further the objects of the Institution, 

 during his connection with the projected U. S. Expedition to the East 

 Indies. 



From Dr. Wm. F. Daniel, dated London, March 12th, 1852, accom- 

 panying the donation of a copy of his work on the Diseases, &c., of 

 Western Africa. 



Dr. LeConte presented a communication intended for publication, en- 

 titled, '' Synopsis of the Anthicites of the United States.'' Referred 

 to Dr. Leidy, Dr. Henderson and Dr. Hallowell. 



Dr. Leidy called the attention of members to two crania of extinct species of 

 Ox. One is the original specimen described by Dr. Wistar in the Transactions 

 of the Am. Phil. Soc.,and afterwards named Bos bombifrons by Dr. Harlan. The 

 second specimen was found on the shore of the Arkansas river, and was brought 

 to this city by Mr. Thomas Kite, of Cincinnati. It is remarkable for the very 

 large process crowning the top of the head, resembling a thick exostosis. Dr. 

 Dekay has described a fragment of the same species,* and referred it to the Bos 

 Pallasii, from which it is, however, very distinct. Dr. L. stated that this fossil, 

 as well as that described as Bos bombifrons, were remarkable for the possession 

 of large larmiers or lachrymal depressions, as in the deer ; and if these are pos- 

 sessed by the Ovibos moschatus, the two fossils would belong to the same genus 

 as Ovibos bombifrons and O. cavifrons ; but if they are not possessed by Ovibos, 

 as is stated to be the case by Desmarest, the two latter species would form a new 

 genus, for which the name Bootherium is proposed. 



May 11th. 

 Major John LeConte in the Chair. 



Letters were read : 



From the Smithsonian Institution, dated Washington, April 14, 

 1852, acknowledging the receipt of the Proceedings of the Academy,

From Prof. A. Retzius, dated Stockholm, Oct. 16, 1851, accompany- 

 ing his donation of works announced this evening. 



From the Rev. Dr. Ducachet, dated May 5, 1852, acknowledging the 

 receipt of his notice of election as a Member. 



Mr. Langstroth, referring to the specimens of Honey Ant presented by him 

 this evening, remarked that they were obtained by his brother in the vicinity 

 of Matamoras, Mexico. He had learned that a part of the colony are incapable 

 of locomotion, and are used as living repositories for the surplus honey of the 

 colony, which in time of need answer the purpose of the full honey-combs of 

 the bee.

72 . [May, 



Dr. Leidy remarked that the honey was contained within the stomach, which, 

 with the abdomen, was enormously distended, assuming a globular condition. 

 The pergamentaceous segments are widely separated and appear as black bands 

 upon the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the translucent abdomen. The thorax 

 and head are about two lines long ; the distended abdomen 4^ lines in diameter. 

 All the other viscera of the abdomen are completely obliterated, and even the 

 tracheal vessels have entirely disappeared, which is an important physiological 

 fact, as by the supply of oxygen being cut off, none of the honey is consumed 

 in the process of respiration. On the outside of the basement membrane of 

 the stomach, is a single layer of branching fibres, (muscular ?) The striped 

 muscular fibres connecting the abdominal segments together, are collected in 

 very thin bands with wide intervals, and are exceedingly elongated. 



A paper by Dr. Woodhouse was presented, entitled ^' Description of a 

 new species of Lepus " (L. larreae,) and intended for publication ; which 

 was referred to Dr. Fisher, Dr. Watson and Dr. Zantzinger. 



Also a second paper by the same, describing a new species of Ecto- 

 pistes, (E. marginella,) which was referred to the same Committee.

 some new Fossil Molluscs in the Carboniferous Slates of the Anthracite 

 Seams of the Wilkesbarre Coal Formation,'^ which was referred to Dr. 

 Wilson, Dr. D. D. Owen and Dr. Leidy. 



Dr. Owen read a paper entitled " Notice of a Mineral from Califor-

The Committee on the following paper by Mr. Charles Girard, of 

 Washington, reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings : 



A Revision of the North American Astaci, with observations on their habits and 



geographical distribution. 



By Charles Girard. 



According to recent investigations,* the crawfishes or Astaci, have been dis- 

 tributed into several genera : thus, the genus Astamis proper includes all the 

 species of Europe and Asia, and two of Australia ; the genus Astacoides is com- 

 posed of two species one from Madagascar and another from Van Diemen's 

 Land ; the genus Chr,raps comprehends three species peculiar to New Holland ; 

 the genus Engceus embraces two species confined to Van Diemen's Land ; and 

 finally, the genus Camharus includes the American species: one from Chili, 

 another from Cuba, two from Mexico and six from the United States. 



Investigations of a still more recent date,t the results of which have not yet 

 been given to the scientific world, refer to the genus Astacus a species from the 

 Columbia river, thus giving again that genus to North America. 



At the request of Dr.Baird, we have examined critically the Astaci preserved at 

 the Smithsonian Institution, collected chiefly by himself. Our researches have 

 made us acquainted with several new species within the limits of the United 

 States, and which we now characterise briefly, deferring to another opportunity 

 ipore full descriptions, accompanied with necessary graphic illustrations. 



First group. Rostrum subquadrangularly elongated, terminated anteriorly by 

 three conical and acute spines, the two lateral smaller than the middle one, 

 which forms the tip. Extremity of the anterior pair of abdominal legs (in the 

 male) straight and acute.

4. Cambarus Pealei, Girard. Diff'ers from C. affinis in having longer anten- 

 nae, and a broader area between the dorsal lines of suture of the carapace. The 

 lateral spine of the rostrum are also much less developed. The color is green- 

 ish brown above, with small green dots on the claws, and sometimes on the 

 cephalo-thorax. A green line or narrow band is observed along the outer edge 

 of the big claws, the tips of which, as well as the tips of the other legs, are 

 orange, preceded by a deep green, almost black circle or ring. On each articu- 

 lation of the tail there is a double, irregular and transverse blood-red band, 

 which extends to the lateral appendages of the caudal rings. Underneath, the 

 body is whitish and rusty.

 in either of the preceding species ; anterior pair of abdominal legs (in the male) 

 elongated, slender, with their tip curved inwards, whilst the same tips are 

 straight in C. affinis y and twisted in C. pelhicidus. The dorsal area is broader 

 than in C. Pealei.

6. CAMBARrs pRopiNQUus, Girard. Closely allied to C. affinis, from which 

 it differs, as well as from C. Pealei, by a proportionally shorter rostrum, and 

 from C. rusticus by a much broader one. The area between the dorsal sutures 

 of the carapace is still broader than in either C. affinis, C. Pealei or C rusticus.

7. Cambarus fossor, Girard. Astacus fossor, Rafin. Amer. Month. Mag. ii. 

 1817,42. 



This species we have not seen, but if Rafinesque's description is correct, 

 " rostrum short, one toothed on each side, "^there can be no hesitation in referring 

 it to this group. He further states that its vulgar name is " burrowing lobster," 

 and that " it burrows in meadows and mill-dams, which it perforates and da- 

 mages." This would indicate habits similar to a species of the second group, 

 which we*describe hereafter, under the name of C. diogenes. We cannot help, 

 however, from expressing some apprehension that on the examination of au- 

 thentic specimens from the same localities whence Rafinesque had obtained his, 

 the rostrum should be found without lateral tooth, in vv^hich case the C. fossor 

 might not differ from our C. diogenes. 



Localities. Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York (Rafinesque.) 



Second group. Rostrum generally broad, conical and short, with margins 

 entire and toothless, terminated anteriorly by an acute and comparatively short 

 point. Anterior pair of abdominal legs (in the male) recurved on their extremity, 

 the tip of which is rounded.

This species, like C. fo.tsorj burrows in the meadows. Such places we have 

 visited in the neighborhoods of the city of Washington, in order to study its pe- 

 culiar habits. The holes, as they appear at the surface of the ground, are nearly 

 circular, from seven-tenths of an inch to one inch and one inch and a half in 

 diameter. The depth of the burrows varies according to the locations; this, we 

 generally found to be from sixteen inches to two feet, and sometimes to three 

 feet and more. The construction of the burrow itself is often exceedingly 

 simple : from the surface of the grouud the excavation exhibits a gradual slope, in 

 direction more or less undulating for a distance from five to ten inches, when it 

 becomes vertical for six or eight inches, and then terminates jn a sudden bottle- 

 shaped enlargement in which the animal is found. The bottom of the burrow 

 having no subterraneous communication, no other issue except towards the sur- 

 face ; it is entirely isolated from its neighbors, and leaves no chance for escape 

 to its inhabitant. The same burrow may have several external holes connected 

 with it, several inclined channels, which, however, meet at the depth where it 

 becomes vertical. We found constantly the cavity full of water, but this was in 

 March and April; the bottom, for several inches, was hlled with a soft and pulpy 

 mud. 



There are other instances of burrows somewhat more complex. Their di- 

 rection may be oblique throughout their whole extent, and composed of a series 

 of chambers or ovoid enlargements succeeding each other at short intervals. Some- 

 times also, and connected with one of the chambers, a narrow and nearly vertical 

 tubuliform channel extends downwards to a much greater depth, and appears to 

 us as a retreat either during the cold winters or else during the dryness of the 

 summer, when water is low. That it is not for the mere purpose of escaping 

 pursuit, we infer from the fact that we repeatedly caught the animals in the 

 chambers above, where they remained quietly instead of attempting to disappear 

 into the apartments below. 



We generally found a single individual in one burrow, it being either a male 

 or a female, the latter in March and April, carrying under the tail a bundle of her 

 eggs. Sometimes, when numerous individuals are gathered on a small space, it 

 may happen that the windings of the upper part of their burrows will accidentally 

 meet and have in this case a communication which was not contemplated. Each 

 individual, however, remains in its own apartment; so at least we constantly 

 found to be the case. 



To accomplish the act of breeding, males and females must come together at 

 one particular time. In one of the burrows which we examined we found a male 

 and a female. We are inclined to believe that the male quits its retreat and 

 goes in search of the female, as one individual of the former sex was found, 

 at one time, walking over the surface of the ground. 



In the spring, and we are told in the fall also, the burrowing crawfish builds 

 over the holes of its burrow a chimney of the maximum height of one loot, but 

 most generally lower. This chimney, circularly pyramidal in shape, is con- 

 structed of lumps of mud, varying in size, irregularly rolled up, and piled up, 

 one upon, each other, and intimately cemented together. Its exterior has a rough 

 and irregular appearance ; whilst the interior is smooth and as uniform as the 

 subterraneous channel, having the same diameter as the latter. The cementing 

 of the successive balls of mud is easily accounted for when we bear in mind that 

 the latter are brought up in a very soft state, and that their drainage and subse- 

 quent solidification on their exposure to the atmospheric air and rays of the sun, 

 is all that is required to unite these parts. 



' The animal works during night. How the work is performed has not yet been 

 ascertained by actual observations. As to the question of the manner in which 

 the mud is modelled into rolls or balls, either the tail, or perhaps the big claws 

 might perform that part of the work. An observation made by John D. God- 

 man* leads us to suppose that the mud is brought up embraced between the chest 

 and the large claws. On an examination of these chimneys we detected the 



Rambles of a Naturalist. Philadelphia, 1833, pp. 40, 41. 




90 [May, 



imprints of the second and third pair of claws, which indicate, evidently, that 

 the parcels of mud, once brought to the surface in the iTianner just stated, are ar- 

 ranijed and fixed in their definitive place by means of these organs. 



When the work has thus been carried on towards completion, the last touch- 

 consists in shutting up the aperture. This is accomplished by means of several 

 balls of mud. brought up from underneath, deposited temporarily on the edge of 

 the chimney and drawn back in close contiguity, so as to intercept all commu- 

 nication with the external world. 



The number of such chimneys is sometimes very great in one particular lo- 

 cality, distributed without any geometrical regularity, and recalling to mind the 

 scattered habitations or village of a newly settled colon}^. 



Whether C diogenes is to be found in other places besides the meadows, 

 we are not prepared to state definitively. We have seen localities where the 

 holes could be traced from the edge of the rivulets to the middle of the 

 meadows, still, there being no subterraneous communication from one burrow to 

 the other, the animal, at any rate, would have to crawl out of the water and 

 walk over land. Colonies of burrowing crawfish are found, we are told, in the 

 interior of lands, far away from any rivulets or waters, a circumstance which 

 would lead to the supposition that these at least pass their entire life in such 

 localities instead of spending one season in the waters and another in dry lands. 

 For, one fact must be very apparent, the existence of several species of craw- 

 fishes with burrowing habits, even in the hypothesis of an identity between 

 C. fossor and C. diogenes. For we learn from Mr. T. R. Peale, of Washington, 

 that chimneys of mud, in all points similar to those just described, were ob- 

 served by him in New Grenada, along the Rio Magdalena, several hundred miles 

 from the sea shore, and consequently indicating the presence there of a species 

 of crawfish which we do not hesitate in pronouncing distinct from C. diogenes. 



It remains now to ascertain how many such there are, and whether some of 

 them are not to be found both in the running waters of the rivulets and in the 

 meadows. 



12. CAMBARTrs LONGULUS, Girard. Rostrum of the same proportional length 

 as in C. diogenes, but it is narrower and slightly concave on the sides. The 

 dorsal area between the sutures of the carapace is very broad, a character which 

 at once distinguishes it from the preceding species. From C. Bartonii it differs 

 by a much more elongated and narrower rostrum. 



Locality. Uncertain; labels having been accidentally lost. Its range, however, 

 is within the middle States of the Union.

This species comes nearest to C.mo7ita7i?is, hut the antennae are still longer and 

 the rostrum more tapering, and terminated by a more elongated point. The 

 dorsal area between the sutures of the carapace is likewise narrower. 



Localities. Lake Ontario, three miles from shore opposite Oswego, taken in 

 the stomach of Lota maculosa (Baird). Brooks near Saratoga, Lake George, 

 Lake Champlain, Utica, Oswego, (Rafinesque). 



14. Cambartjs robttstus, Girard. Differs from C. Bartonii by stouter an- 

 tennae, composed of shorter articulations and by proportionally more elongated 

 and more conical rostrum and a more acute terminal point- From C.pnsilhis it 

 is distinguished by having shorter antennae, besides a difference in the shape of 

 the rostrum. The dorsal lines of suture of the carapace, on the other hand, do 

 not approximate as much as in C. diogenes., although nearer than in both C Bar- 

 tonii and C. pusillns. It differs from C. longalas by a broader rostrum and a 

 narrower dorsal area. The anterior pair of abdominal legs in the male, more- 

 over, is flattened and twisted. 



Locality. Humber River, near Toronto (Canada). 



15. Cambarus Gambelii, Girard.^-Antennae, about the length of the body, 

 from the tip of the rostrum to the origin of the tail. Rostrum proportionally 

 long and conical as in C. diogenes and C. longnlt/s, but is bordered on each side 

 with a row of minute and conical tubercles. Anterior claw very stout, bearing 




1852.] 91r 



tufts of fine hairs. Anterior pair of abdominal legs, elongated, resembling some- 

 what in shape those of C. rub-usttts, to which it bears a close relationship. 



Locality. California. Collected by the lamented Dr. William Gambel, to 

 whose memory we inscribe the species. Specimens are deposited at the Academy 

 of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. 



16. Cambarus NEBRASCENSis, Girard. Rostrum intermediate, in form be- 

 tween that of C robiistus and C. diogenes. Dorsal lines of suture of the cara-

18. Ca:mbarus Clarkti, Girard. Antennae long and slender, nearly as long 

 as the body and tail. Rostrum tapering, but very gradually from its base to 

 the lateral spines, though the terminal point is more elongated than in C Blan- 

 dingii. Anterior pair of abdominal legs terminated by two nearly equal and 

 rounded tubercles. 



Locality. Between San Antonio (Texas) andEl Paso del Norte ; collected by 

 John H. Clark, Esq., under Lieut. Col. J. D. Graham, late head of Scientific 

 Corps U. S. Boundary Commission. 



19. Cambarus acutus, Girard. Rostrum proportionally shorter than in both 

 C. Blandingii and C acutissivnis ; very broad at its base, and tapering very 

 suddenly towards its extremity. The lateral spines of the rostrum are scarcely 

 to be seen in this species ; the tip is likewise very short although very acute. 

 The structure of the anterior pair of abdominal legs in the male, differs from 

 that of C. Blandingii and C. Clarkii, by the more slender shape of the termi- 

 nating tubercles. The antennae have nearly the same proportional length as in 

 C. Clarl'ii, 



Locality. From an affluent of Mobile river in Kemper Co., Miss. ; specimens 

 received from D. C. Lloyd, Esq. 



20. Cambarus AcuTissiML'S, Girard. Rostrum much more elongated than in 

 any of the species of the same group; very much tapering and very acute, with 

 slight indications of the lateral spines which are so well developed in C. Blan- 

 dingii. The anterior abdominal pair of legs is terminated by a slender and re- 

 curved tip. 



Locality. Found with the preceding and sent by the same gentleman to Pro- 

 fessor Baird. 



The Committee on Dr. Leeonte's Synopsis of the Anthicites of the 

 United States, reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings : 



Synopsis of the Jnthicites of the United States. 

 By John L. LeConte, M. D. 



Although it is but three years since M. de la Ferte Senectere published his 

 very beautiful and elaborate monograph of Anthicus, yet the species known to 

 inhabit our territory have almost doubled in number. Most of these have been 

 published by me already in the Annals of the Lyceum of Natural History of 

 New York, and in Prof. Agassiz's work on the Physical Character of Lake 

 Superior. The object I had in view in the beginning "of my study of this group, 




92 [iMay, 



was to make known several species of genera associated by Ferte with the 

 Anthicites, such as Stereopalpus and Eurygenius ; but after an attentive study 

 of these genera, I became convinced that they, as well as Macratria,* must be 

 removed from this group altogether. The two first must be placed among the 

 Pyrochroites, a synopsis of which will shortly appear. Having also increased 

 this family by one very distinct genus, I thought that it would be useful to bring 

 together the descriptions that are now scattered in several works, into the form 

 of a synopsis, so that the species being placed in a natural relation with each 

 other, the characters of each might become more obvious. It is remarkable 

 that of all the indigenous species, only one (Notoxus monodon) should be com- 

 mon to both sides of the continent. Anthicus floralis, found both here and in 

 Europe, is most probably introduced in articles of commerce. Ferte mentions 

 its occurrence also in California. 



With regard to the affinities of this group I can say but little. Some authors 

 imagine that there exists a relation between them and the Scydmaeni, which, 

 however, appears rather a resemblance of form, for a certain manner of life, 

 than a true affinity ; for besides the differences in the palpi and insertion of the 

 antennae, the prosternum in Scydmaenus is entirely separated from the lateral 

 infiexed portions of the thorax, while in Anthicus it is all in one piece. The 

 true afl[inities appear to be with the Pyrochroites, from which they are dis- 

 tinguished only by the form of the parapleurae, which in Anthicus are triangular, 

 and in Pyrochroites parallel. Other differences are in the neck of Pyrochroites 

 being less narrow and not so distinctly separated as in Anthicus; in the antennae 

 being inserted in front of, and very close to the eyes, which are large and more 

 or less emarginate, extending far on the under surface of the head, and frequent- 

 ly almost uniting on the vertex. 



The diagnosis of the present tribe will then be : 



Coleopteraheteromera^ capite postice valde coarctatOj collo distinctissimo ; ocv- 

 lis integerrimisj lateralibus ; nnandihulis apice emarginatis ; ahdomine ft-articu'

Southern States; the obsolete punctures of the posterior part of the elytra is 

 the only character for separating this species from the preceding, in which the 

 punctures frequently show a tendency to form series. I am very doubtful 

 whether they should be considered distinct.

This group is only separated from genuine Anthicus by the oval, convex elytra 

 without distinct humeri, and by its more strongly clavate femora. J have placed 

 it in brackets to signify that 1 do not adopt the name.

Sea beach of Sullivan's Island, S. Carolina : June. Body bright reddish yellow, 

 very smooth and shining; head large slightly convex, rounded behind, marked 

 with a few distant punctures, and four or five erect black hairs ; front blackish : 

 antennae with the joints 2 6 slender, nearly equal, 7 11 gradually increasing in 

 size. Thorax as long as the head and one half narrower, transversely convex, 

 much narrowed and constricted just behind the middle, then widened a little to 

 the base, which on each siile has a wide shallow fovea. Elytra oval, gradually 

 dilated to the middle, where they are three times as wide as the thorax; apex 

 rounded: humeral angles obsolete, disc convex smooth, ornamented with a large 

 lateral blackish spot at the middle, and a narrow blackish band between that and 

 the apex; margin with a lew black bristles. Body beneath finely punctured, 

 and slightly pubescent, thighs slightly incrassated, tarsi slender, lobes of the 4th 

 joint very narrow, produced beneath ; posterior tibice slightly compressed and 

 bent. 



I can find no sexual difference. This and the next species might more pro- 

 perly enter Ferte's 4th division of Anthicus, but both have the neck of the thorax 

 distinct, and this one is completely apterous. At any rate they show the necessity 

 of uniting the two genera.

Formicilla mnnda Lee. An. Lye. 5, 152. Bright reddish yellow, very smooth 

 and shining, with a few black setae ; antennas, head and thorax as in the last, 

 except that the latter is less convex on the disc, and has three points at the 

 middle of the base. Elytra much less convex, slightly dilated as far as the 

 middle, rounded at the apex ; humeri distinct obtuse : disc obsoletely and 

 sparsely punctured before the middle, post humeral impression large and distinct: 

 ornamented with a very broad black fascia at the middle, and a very large 

 common black spot, which extends nearly to the apex, leaving only a narrow 

 yellow fascia between it and the band just described, and a narrow lateral and 

 apical margin yellow. Body beneath ferruginous, finely punctured and pubescent. 

 Thighs moderately incrassated. 



I found only two specimens of this insect, on the lower part of the Colorado 

 River. It agrees so closely in general characters with the preceding species, 

 that it would be unnatural to separate it as a distinct genus. I am, therefore, 

 led to believe that the filiform tarsi, ascribed by me to this insect, must be an 

 error of observation, depending on the condition of the specimens, which unfor- 

 tunately became mouldy at Panama. All my attempts to cleanse the tarsi have 

 heretofore proved useless ; and I may add, that in A. scitulus, the lobes of the 

 fourth tarsal joint are so delicate, that the slightest dirt is sufficient to render 

 them invisible. 



Anthicus PaykuU. 



Although the arrangement followed by Ferte may be the most convenient in 

 working with species from every part of the world, yet it has appeared to me 

 to be capable of some improvement, when used in the study of our native 

 species. I have therefore attempted to separate them into homogeneous groups, 

 so that the diagnoses of the species may thereby be shortened, and the labor of 

 identifying species diminished. The following table seems to answer the pur- 

 pose without any great violation of affinity.

Georgia and Missouri Territory. I have always considered this species 

 as A. cinctus Say, but, after renewed investigation, feel inclined to 

 adopt Ferte's conclusion, that Say's species is more allied to A. formicarius. 

 The expression " elytra hirsute " will by no means apply to the present species, 

 nor is there ever a cinereous spot at the tip of the elytra. The male has the 

 posterior tibiae dilated and sinuated internally.

Lee. An. Lye. 5, 153. 



Colorado River, California. Approaches very close to the preceding species 

 in form, but the last joint of the palpi is longer than wide. The anterior part of 

 the thorax is less globose than in A. formicarius, with which, however, it agrees 

 so closely in the form of the body and structure of the palpi, that it would be

quite unnatural to separate them. The elytra of the male are truncate at apex, 

 so that the pygidium is visible.

New York and Massachusetts, usually in salt marshes. The anterior part of 

 the thorax is convex, and sparsely punctured ; the posterior lobe is a little 

 widened towards the base, and is tolerably densely punctured. The base of the 

 antennae and tarsi are testaceous. The punctures of the elytra become small 

 behind the middle. The male has the pygidium prominent.

Illinois ; Mr. Willcox. This species is very closely allied to the preceding, 

 but differs in color, and in the sculpture of the posterior lobe of the thorax, 

 which, instead of being punctured, is densely and finely granulate. The punc- 

 tures of the front part of the elytra are also more numerous. The head is 

 marked with a few punctures, and the occiput with a very short impressed line, 

 just as in the last species. The pygidium of the male projects.

One specimen, from the sea-shore at San Diego, California. The thorax is 

 longer than wide, much rounded on the sides before the middle, then narrowed, 

 and slightly constricted before the base, which is cylindrical, very finely punc- 

 tured, and distinctly bituberculate. The punctures of the elytra grow small 

 behind the middle.

Ferte, Anthic. 128. 



Abundant at San Diego, California, on the sea-shore, and in the marshes. 

 The thorax is more obliquely rounded on the sides before the middle than in the 

 last species ; the tubercles of the base are scarcely visible. The punctures of 

 the head and thorax are very distinct, and those of the latter become very dense 

 towards the base. 



This species varies very much in color. The spots are usually quite unde- 

 fined. I have a specimen with pale yellowish elytra, and the spots very well 

 defined ; the anterior one is placed near the middle, is very large, and extends 

 nearly to the suture. Others occur which are entirely black. The male has 

 the abdomen subtruncate at the apex.

 is slightly constricted, cylindrical portion of the base shorter than in the pre- 

 ceding, densely punctured, with two very obsolete tubercles. Elytra somewhat

Found in every part of the United States. For the synonyms see Ferte's 

 Monograph. As they do not relate to the occurrence of the insect on this con- 

 tinent, they are here entirely out of place. From the other almost glabrous 

 species found here, this is immediately distinguished by its impressed vertex. 

 The thorax most commonly has two prominences anteriorly, separated by an 

 impressed line. 



The variety without these protuberances has a more distinct posthumeral 

 impression on the elytra, and is evidently A. basillaris Say.

Ferte, Anthic. 157. 



Common in the xMiddle and Southern States. This species varies in color 

 exceedingly. The diagnosis is from the light colored variety. The basal dark 

 spot of the elytra is sometimes wanting ; sometimes the head is fuscous ; some- 

 times the whole insect, excepting the base of the antennae and the tarsi, is 

 black. Ferte describes the head as impunctured, but I have never met with 

 any on the head of which a few points could not be discovered.

Ferte, Anthic. 158. 



Georgia, rare. The co-existence of bright red thorax and legs, with black 

 immaculate elytra, is the only character to separate this species from the pre- 

 ceding, with which it accurately agrees in the form of every part of the body. 

 In one of my specimens there is a faint piceous band behind the middle of the 

 elytra, which would seem to be the last trace of the spots which exist in A. 

 vicinus. It would therefore seem safer to consider it as a variety of the pre- 

 ceding.

 less rugous, with a broad frontal smooth line. I am somewhat in doubt if this 

 really is Ferte's species, as he makes no mention of the smooth frontal space. 

 It is, however, compared with the A. sellatus, in which this line is very 

 distinct, so that the probability is that it also existed in his A. ephippium.

 to cover nearly the anterior half of the elytra, and the posterior spots coalescing: 

 so that the elytra become yellow, with the suture, a transverse band at the mid- 

 dle, and the apex fuscous. The thighs are sometimes fuscous. The frontal line 

 is narrow and indistinct, and the points on the head are not very dense. Those 

 of the elytra are a little larger and very dense. The thorax becomes very 

 slightly cylindrical at base. It seems to resemble very much A. 4-maculatus

 head is a little more square behind, and there is scarcely a trace of an occipital 

 impression. The thorax is more convex in front, though scarcely enough so to 

 be described as round, and T have therefore doubts about it being identical with 

 the California species described by Ferte.

 slightly narrowed behind ; the basal margin is indistinct. The elytra are convex, 

 truncate at the base, with the humeral angles moderately rounded. The punc-

One specimen, New York. This species and the two following differ from 

 all the preceding, in the form of the elytra, which are convex, truncate at base, 

 and with the sides straight as far as the middle, parallel in the males, slightly 

 diverging in the females, with the base each side of the scutellum a little 

 elevated. The head of this species is wider than the thorax, the eyes large ; 

 the frontal line narrow ; the occiput impressed ; thorax almost square, rounded 

 anteriorly, scarcely narrowed behind, very finely and densely punctured. Elytra 

 twice as wide as the thorax, punctures coarse, not dense ; the feet and base of 

 the antennae are piceous.

Louisiana, Mr. Wapler. Smaller than the preceding, with which it agrees 

 pefectly in shape, except that the thorax is more distinctly narrowed behind. 

 The head is much less densely punctulate, and the occiput is not impressed. 

 The pubescence is very different, being fine, short and not all erect. 



This is very evidently La Ferte^s species, although he says that the thorax 

 is not margined at base. I fear this is an error, as of all the American species 

 I have examined, there is but a single one, A. coracinus Lee. in which the 

 marginal line is not to be discovered.

I found this species very abundant at the junction of the Colorado and Gila 

 rivers, under the bark of trees. It agrees accurately in form with the two pre- 

 ceding species, but the head and thorax are impunctured; there is no occipital 

 impression ; the thorax is scarcely longer than wide, and is but slightly narrowed 

 behind. '1 he antennae are fuscous, with the base testaceous.

San Diego, under sea-weed. At once distinguished by the roundness and 

 convexity of the elytra, which have scarcely any humeral angles; the frontal 

 line is very fine ; the thorax is as wide as the head, regularly narrowed to the 

 base, which is scarcely perceptibly margined. A variety occurs with the 

 suture and base of the elytra pale. Ferte's figure of A. bignttatus 

 represents very well this insect ; the species resembling it from the Atlantic 

 coast of the United States (A. i c t e r i c u s Ferte,) I have not yet seen.

Two specimens from the Upper Mississippi. This species differs from all the 

 preceding by the thorax being perfectly without a basal margin, even at the 

 sides. The head is wider than the thorax, subquadrate, posterior angles broadly 

 rounded, base slightly emarginate, and impressed in the middle ; it is finely and 

 tolerably densely punctured; the eyes are small ; the antennae moderately thick. 

 The thorax is longer than wide, a little narrowed behind, punctured as the 

 head ; anterior constriction distinct. Elytra scarcely wider than the head, 

 parallel, truncate at base, strongly and coarsely punctured, base very slightly 

 prominent each side ; the pubescence is scarcely visible. The male has the 

 pygidium prominent.

 the mould on the specimens having prevented me at that time from seeing the 

 generic characters. The following characters will separate this genus :

This curious insect was found on the shore of a salt lake in the northern part 

 of the great Colorado desert. It runs very actively and frequently takes flight, 

 like Cicindela or Bembidium. 



Keddish brown, with very fine cinereous hair. Head flat, quadrate, shining, 

 finely punctured, posterior angles rounded, occiput channeled, margin almost 

 acute. Thorax narrower than the head, a little longer than wide, trapezoidal, 

 slightly narrowed behind, base finely margined, slightly foveate in the middle ; 

 disc flat, finely punctured ; elytra not wider than the head, parallel, truncate at 

 base and tip, opaque, very finely and densely punctured, dusky towards the 

 base. Legs long, moderately slender ; posterior tarsi nearly as long as the 

 tibiae. The male has the anterior tarsi a little dilated.

Found at San Diego, California. A much smaller specimen, with the head 

 more rounded behind, was found at the Gila. 



Elongate, almost depressed, black, opaque, scarcely pubescent. Head large, 

 slightly convex, finely punctured, base truncate, with the margin not acute, 

 posterior angles broadly rounded. Thorax narrower than the head, trapezoidal, 

 narrowed behind, base margined ; finely punctured. Elytra scarcely wider than 

 the head, truncate at base and tip, very finely rugous, and very obsoletely punc- 

 tured. Posterior tarsi shorter than the tibiae. The last joint of the antennae is 

 here only twice as long as the preceding, and the constriction is at its middle, 

 so that it appears like two ordinary joints. It was not until I removed the 

 mould very carefully, and counted the joints, that I became aware of the aflfinity

Description of a new species of Ectopistes. 

 By S. W. Woodhouse, M. D. 



Ectopistes Tnarginella, nobis. 



Form. Bill short and slender, wings long and pointed, second quill distinctly 

 longest, its general form resembling E. Carolinensis, but much more delicate. 



Dimensions. From tip of bill to end of tail, total length of skin 9 3-lOths 

 inches ; wing from flexure 5 4-lOths inches ; tarsus 7^-lOths; bill total length 

 6-lOths, from gap 7-lOths; tail 4 inches. 



Color. Bill dark brown ; upper surface of the head brown, mottled with 

 black and light brown ; head, front of neck, back, and upper tail coverts, of a 

 lightish brown ; a brownish white band extends from each eye across the fore- 

 head ; one reddish brown from the anterior part of the orbit to the back of the 

 head; throat very light brown inclining to white: the feathers of the lower 

 portion of the throat are black, with a light brown margin, giving the appear- 

 ance of circular bands of black and white ; breast, belly, vent and under tail 

 coverts light fawn ; sides lead color ; primaries dark brown ; the first, second 




1852.] 105 



and third quills have a white line extending along their ou^f r edge ; secondaries 

 are rather lighter, and have a light brown margin, on their upper surface they 

 are reddish brown ; tertiary feathers and wing coverts reddish brown, with a 

 light margin, and on their outer edge an elongated black spot ; tail consists of 

 fourteen feathers, the two central of which are dark brown ; the four lateral 

 feathers are black near their extremity and white at tip ; and the six lateral 

 have the black, but are light brown at tip ; tarsus and feet light red. 



Habitation. Cross Timbers. 



Observations. This specimen somewhat resembles the E. Carolinensis, but on 

 examination proves to be totally different. I procured it in the cross timbers on 

 the North Fork of the Canadian, on the 6th of September, 1850, whilst attached 

 to the Creek boundary survey as surgeon and naturalist, under the command of 

 Lieut. J. C. Woodruff, Topographical Engineers, U. S. Army. I saw several of 

 them feeding on the ground, and was immediately struck with their size, being 

 so much smaller than our common dove. I was unable, however, to procure 

 but one specimen, and this on dissection proved to be a male.

Mr. Lea called attention to the stone slab containing supposed im- 

 prints of human feet, deposited by him this evening. This slab is from 

 the limestone formation immediately underlying the coal near Alton, 

 Illinois. The impressions have evidently been sculptured, and bear the 

 marks of some blunt instrument with which they have been executed. 

 Mr. Lea observed that these are not the first instances of this kind, 

 which have been noticed, and referred to a description of a similar slab 

 published in Silliman's Journal several years since. 



Dr. Owen stated that the slab of limestone alluded to by Mr. Lea as found 

 on the Mississippi near St. Louis, is the same which is now preserved in his 

 (Dr. Owen's) collection, and the one on which two articles have appeared in 

 Silliman's Journal ; one by Mr. Schoolcraft and one by himself. At the con- 

 clusion of this latter article, entitled " Human footprints in solid limestone," it 

 was given as his opinion that these feetraarks were carved on the rock by the 

 aborigines. 



Since that article appeared. Dr. Owen had obtained the most satisfactory cor- 

 roboration of this inference in two large slabs of magnesian limestone, of lower 

 Silurian date, obtained at Moccasin-track Prairie, in Missouri, which slabs con- 

 tained a great many carvings of human feet, as well as those of animals, and 

 rude imitations of the human figure, something like figures made in gingerbread. 

 The footmarks bear indubitable tool marks, and some are deficient in the true 

 number of toes, while, in others, the foot is distorted, with the little toe stand- 

 ing out almost at right angles. 



These specimens, as well as that of Mr. Lea, show clearly that the aborigines 

 of Missouri had the same propensity for carving the imprint of feet, as the 

 Southern and Western aborigines of this continent had for representing the 

 hand on the walls of the ancient edifices, and in other situations. 



Any one acquainted with Indians knows that there is no subject which they 

 study more closely than all kinds of tracks : in fact their life, their maintenance 

 and the whole security of the savage depends on an intimate and cunning know- 

 ledge of podology. 



Dr. Owen intends giving, at some future time, a more detailed description of 

 these slabs of magnesian limestone from Moccasin-track Prairie, which are, 

 probably, the most interesting specimens of the kind ever yet discovered. 



Mr. Lea exhibited specimens of shells from the drift on the line of 

 the Columbia Railroad, about three miles from Philadelphia. These 

 are the first organic remains of this kind found in this vicinity, Mr. 

 Lea believed them to have been unquestionably derived from the forma- 

 tion No. 2 of the Pennsylvania Survey. Although much mutilated, 

 they can be classified. 



Dr. Leidy called attention to a fossil tooth of Tapir presented by Dr. 

 Hays. This is the only portion of the animal known. He proposed for 

 it the name of Tapirus Haysii.

Nearly all of the specimens are unusually valuable and interesting on account 

 of their representing species in much more mature plumage than is commonly 

 seen either in Museums or in recent specimens obtained so far south as Phila-

 species in the collection are only to be met with while in summer plumage in 

 the remote regions visited by the Expedition, and their interesting character 

 may be inferred from that fact.

The Committee on Dr. Owen^s paper on a new Mineral from Califor- 

 nia, reported in favor of publication : 



Notice of a New Mineral from California. 

 By D. D.Owen, M.D. 



Mr. Henry Pratten, one of my assistants in the geological surveys in the 

 North West in 1848 and 1849, went to California in the spring of 1850, and 

 returned last February. Being interested in mineralogy and geology, he made 

 observations in these departments of science, both on his way out and during the 

 time he remained there. 



The mineral in question he obtained at a locality known as the Wisconsin 

 and Illinois claim, near Nevada City, at which place he resided most of the 

 time he remained in California. 



At the time he collected this mineral it struck him as something remarkable 

 and different from anything he had previously observed ; and he made at the 

 time some experiments on its blowpipe reactions, without being able positively 

 to decide what it might be. 



He then first submitted it to a distinguished mineralogist, who referred it to 

 the species Karpholite. 



In comparing its blowpipe reactions with that mineral, Mr. Pratten doubted 

 the correctness of the conclusion that it belonged to the species Karpholite, and 

 so did Dr. Norwood, who also examined its blowpipe reactions ; and they came 

 to the conclusion that its indications before the blowpipe resembled more those 

 of Molybdic acid. 



When I returned home last March, Mr. Pratten submitted it to me and I made 

 a qualitative examination of the mineral in the humid way, and ascertained, 

 from the reactions of the solution of the mineral with sulphuretted hydrogen, 

 iodide of potassium, and ferro-cyanide of potassium, that the principal consti- 

 tuents were molybdenum and iron. 



I found, moreover, that it was easily acted on by liquid ammonia, the molyb- 

 denum being dissolved, while oxide of iron was set free in brownish red flocks. 



These chemical reactions proved that though the mineral resembles Karpho- 

 lite in the yellow color of its fibrous, acicular, tufted crystals, it is quite 

 different in its chemical constitution. 



I made, also, an approximate quantitative analysis on a centigramme of the 

 mineral, which was all that could be spared at that time, by solution in liquid 

 ammonia ; collecting the precipitated iron on a filter, washing and weighing it 

 after ignition. The molybdenum was then separated by sulphuretted hydrogen. 



The solution freed from molybdenum was evaporated with addition of hydro- 

 chloric acid to free the solution of HS ; after filtration it was evaporated to 

 dryness and ignited, and the small percentage of alkali and magnesia weighed 

 together; the magnesia, after being separated by peroxide of mercury, was 

 Weighed by itself. 



The result of the analysis gave : 



H=Water 15 



Mo (?) Molybdic acid(?) . . 40 compound of molybdenum and oxygen 

 Fe Peroxide of iron . . .35 



Alkali 9 



Mg Magnesia .... 2 



That the molybdenum exists in this mineral as molybdic acid is altogether 

 probable from the fact of liquid amiBinia acting on it so readily. 




1852.] 



109 



The constituents of Karpholite, by two analyses one by Stromeyer and one 

 by Steinman, as recorded in Dana's Mineralogy, are : 



Si Silica 

 ... 



Al Alumina . 







Mn Oxide of Manganese 

 Fe " Iron 



H Water 



10-78 



11-86 



HF Hydrofluoric acid . . 1-47 



Karpholite is therefore essentially a hydrated silicate of alumina and manga- 

 nese, and entirely different in its composition from the mineral in question. 



Before the blowpipe this mineral fuses readily, and a sublimate is formed, 

 which, if the mineral is supported on its quartz matrix, forms a bluish ring on 

 the quartz ; and a brilliant yellow color is imparted to the flame. With mic. 

 salt, in the interior flame, it forms a green bead. 



In its easy fusibility and in the production of this curious bluish ring, con- 

 densed on the quartz around the fragment exposed to the blowpipe flame, this 

 mineral is readily distinguished by the blowpipe from Karpholite, which fuses 

 with difficulty, and forms no such ring. 



In the works on mineralogy, there is a meagre notice given of an ore of molyb- 

 denum, under the name of molybdic ochre or oxide of molybdenum, which occurs 

 in powdery incrustations of various shades of yellow, and is in fact molybdic acid, 



being composed of molybdenum 63-66, and oxygen 33-39 (Mo.); but as this 

 mineral contains no iron, is produced from the decomposition of the sulphuret of 

 molybdenum, and has never been found in the fine delicate tufted acicular crys- 

 talline form, it is probably not the same as this California mineral. 



I have not yet had a sufficient supply of the ore to ascertain the proportion of 

 oxygen united with the molybdenum in this mineral, but I am led to believe 

 that it exists in the state of molybdic acid, from the fact of ammonia acting on 

 it so readily. I think, moreover, that the molybdic acid is combined with the 

 iron, for the pure rich yellow color of the mineral forbids the idea of the iron 

 being only mechanically mixed ; and besides the iron is very nearly in the pro- 

 portion to form a subsalt : hence I infer that this mineral must be a submolybdate 

 of iron.

Description of a new species of Eschara^from the Eocene of Alabama. 



By Isaac Lea. 



Many years since I received from the late Judge Tait of Claiborne, a large 

 number of fossils from the Eocene 

 beds of that district, and among 

 the sand was found a fragment of 

 this interesting genus. I did not 

 then characterise it, in the hope of 

 getting a more perfect specimen. 

 I have not, however, seen any 

 other but this fragment.

 Wetherill, reported in favor of publication : 



Cheimcal Investigation of the Meodcaii Honey A7it. 

 By Charles M. WETHERirx, Ph. D. 



Several of these curious insects, described in a late number of the Proceedings, 

 were handed to me some time since by Dr. Leidy, with the request that I would 

 make a chemical examination of them. I was fearful at the time, from the 

 scarcity of material, and from the endosmosis and exosmosis that had apparently 

 taken place, (as the ants had been preserved for some time in alcohol,) that I 

 could not arrive at satisfactory conclusions. The difficulties were not, however, 

 as great as anticipat^^d. The following are the results of my experiments. 



The ants were filled with a varying quantity of the honey; in some the 

 abdomen was distended, in others quite flaccid. The liquid also varied; 

 in some being of light amber color, and in others deeper in hue. Six of 

 the average sized insects weighed 2.6o3.3 grammes, their bodies weighed 

 0.288 gr. The honey, consequently, of the six ants weighed 2.3653 grammes, 

 and the average quantity of honey in a single ant 0.3942 gr. Since the average 

 wei^^ht of a single ant is 0.04S, it follows that the honey which an average one of 

 these ants contains is 8.2 times greater than the weight of its body. The density 

 of the ants, when filled with honey, and that of their bodies, was ascertained by 

 weighing in alcohol of density 0.8309, and reducing to water as unity. 



The following are the data : 



2.6533 grammes of the ants, with their honey, weighed in alcohol 0.9310 ; and 

 of the bodies without the honey 0.288 weighed 0.061 in alcohol. 



From which the density is calculated; for the ants filled with honey at 1.28, 

 and for the bodies alone 1.05. 



The syrup extracted from the ant had an agreeable sweet taste, the odor very 

 much resembling that of the syrup of squills. It reacted slightly acid to blue 

 litmus paper. When evaporated by the heat of steam, it dried to a gummy mass, 

 which did not exhibit traces of crystallization after standing for a couple of weeks. 

 It was very hygroscopic, becoming quickly soft from the absorption of water 

 from the atmosphere. 



The sugar dried, as stated, by steam heat, dissolved without residue in ordi- 

 nary alcohol, leaving a residue in nearly absolute alcohol. This residue dis- 

 solved in ordinary alcohol completely. The alcoholic solutions were all set 

 aside, for several days, for crystallization, with negative results. These alco- 

 holic solutions had exactly the snriell of the perfumed bay rum. I call attention 

 to these peculiar odors, as perhaps capable, with additional evidence, of throwing 

 some light upon the origin of the honey. 



When exposed for some time in vacuo over sulphuric acid, the syrup dries up 

 to a transparent gum-like mass, but without any signs of crystallization during 

 the process. 2.1065 of the syrup, after standing thus in vacuo for about two 

 weeks, weighed 1.4425, equal to a per centage of 68.478, sugar in the syrup. 

 When thus dried it had the rich sugar smell of candy made by heating sugar and 

 butter together. 



Some of the honey was set aside for crystallization as removed from the insect. 

 After many days it was examined, but no traces of crystallization could be 

 observed, either with the naked eye or with the microscope. Some of the honey 

 was examined alone, under the microscope with high powers; no crystals were 

 observed, but here aqd there fragments of organic tissue. Examined by polarized 

 light, some of these stood out in bright relief against the dark ground of the field, 

 and were at first mistaken for fragments of crystals, until a capillary like tube 

 was observed, which resembled these fragments, and which changed its color by 

 the rotation of the polarization's plane. 



No change could be observed after touching the drop under the microscope with 

 a drop of solution or tincture of iodine- 



17 




112 [June, 



A drop of the honey, in a watch glass, blackened when exposed to a steam heat 

 with dilate sulphuric acid. 



When heated with the blue solution obtained by adding tartaric acid or solu- 

 tion of potassa to sulphate of copper, a red precipitate of the suboxide of copper 

 fell. 



Chloride of bariunn, ferrocyanitle of potassium, and sulphate of copper, added 

 to an aqueous solution of the honey, gave no precipitates, either in the cold or 

 by heat. 



Nitrate of silver gave in the cold a whitish precipitate, which changed to dark 

 brown by heating. 



A portion of ihe honey heated on platinum foil blackened, gave out fumes, and 

 the odor of burnt sugar, leaving a porous coke, which burned off and left an al- 

 most imperceptible ash. 



A portion of the substance which had been left in vacuo for two weeks was 

 taken for analysis by combustion with oxide of copper and chlorate of potassa. 



As the honey thus dried was not perfectly hard, but of a sticky nature, it was 

 necessary to introduce it into the combustion tube upon a piece of glass. 0.497 

 of honey gave 0.306 of water,' and 0.684 of carbonic acid, corresponding to a per 

 centage of C = 37.525 and H = 6.841 by loss = 55.634. This corresponds, as 

 nearly as could be expected, under the circumstances of the analysis, with the 

 formula of crystallized grape sugar C12 Hi4 Ou as may be seen by the following 

 comparison : 



100.000 100.000 100.00 



The following analysis may be compared with my results : 1. Diabetic sugar 

 by Peligot. 2. Sugar of grape, by De Saussure. 3. Cane sugar, by Liebig. 

 4. Sugar of honey, by Prout.

It results, I think, from these experiments that the honey contained in the 

 Mexican ant is a nearly pure solution of the sugar, so called, of fruits whifth is in 

 a state of hydration, isomeric with grape sugar, Ci2 Hi4 On, and differing from 

 grape sugar in not crystallizing. The phenomena of circular polarization differ 

 in these two named sugars ; but the want of sufficient material rendered such 

 comparison impossible. The honey of bees is a mixture of these two kinds of 

 sugar ; and as it is obtained from the nectar of flowers cotitaining cane sugar, the 

 transformation into fruit and grape sugars must take place in their bodies.* As 

 the ant honey yields, among its reactions, one of cane sugar, viz: that of black- 

 ening when heated with dilute sulphuric acid, it is possible that it may contain 

 an admixture of cane sugar, which would account for the imperfect correspond- 

 ence of the analysis with the per centage calculated from the formula. It renders 

 also the supposition plausible, that these ants obtain their honey from the same 

 source as the bee. 



With regard to the acidity of the honey, want of material prevented any expe- 

 riments. Can it be formic acid, or is it acetic from the oxidation of the alcohol 

 in which the ants were preserved /

A portion of the alcohol (reacting acid like the honey) neutralized by caustic 

 potassa, then distilled with sulphuric acid, gave an aqueous acid liquid, which, on 

 addition of nitrate of silver, gave a whitish precipitate, becoming black on boil- 

 ing, rendering the supposition of formic acid probable. 



The Committee on the two papers by Dr. Genth, entitled respectively

 the Proceedings. 



On some Minerals, wJdch accompany Gold in California. 

 By Dr. F. A. Genth. 



A few days ago I had an opportunity of examining a lot of Gold from the north 

 fork of the American River, 30 miles from Sacramento City. 



The gold was in very fine scales and but a few larger pieces among them. 

 The following minerals have been found mixed with it, viz. : 



1. Hyacintli in almost microscopic crystals, of different lengths. The longer 

 ones exhibit the form of the primitive square octahedron combined with the 

 second square prism ; the shorter ones have besides, a second octahedron, a 

 double eight-sided pyramid and the first prism ; one of the crystals I found having 

 a basal plane besides. They are colorless or show a smoky tinge; only a few 

 less perfect crystals have a grayish-brown color. Lustre perfectly adamantine. 



2. Chromic Iron in rounded grains, which sometimes show faces of the regular 

 octahedron. Color between jet-black and iron-black. Lustre submetallic. 

 Streak brown. Not magnetic. Before the blowpipe with borax it gives in both 

 flames emerald-green beads. The powder was decomposed by bisulphate of 

 potash, and the presence of sesqui-oxide of iron and chromium likewise ascer- 

 tained in the moist way. 



3. Ilmenite occurs in iron-black grains, which show sometimes distinctly a 

 basal cleavage. Lustre submetallic. Streak brownish, and iron-black. Before 

 the blowpipe it gives a blood-red bead, which, when saturated, can be easily 

 enameled. The powder is easily decomposed by bisulphate of potash; the fused 

 mass dissolves completely in diluted hydrochloric acid, and this solution, when 

 evaporated, lets fall a white powder, which gives with borax and microcosmic 

 salt the characteristic reactions of titanic acid. The solution in hydrochloric 

 acid contains nothing but sesqui-oxide of iron. 



[Both Chromic Iron and Ilmenite seem to have been confounded with magnetic 

 iron.] 



4. Platimim. A few steel-colored rounded grains were observed, and of 



5. Iriclosmi7ie, a few lead-colored scales. The quantity of both Platinum and 

 Iridosmine was too small for further examination. 



I will mention here, that I have examined some white grains and scales from 

 Stanislaus in California, which were presented to me by Prof. John Frazer, 

 whose brother had them collected. 



The few scales of gold mixed with them were extracted by diluted aqua regia. 

 I then treated them with concentrated aqua regia as long as it acted upon. 



The solution contained almost pure bichloride of platinum with but a trace of 

 iridium ; neither rhodium nor palladium could be detected in it. 



The residue consists of six-sided scales of a color between lead- and tin-white. 

 On heating them upon platinum foil, they give out a strong odor of osmium ; they 

 are therefore the combination Ir Os4 (or Ir OS3) known under the name of Sis- 

 sershite. Being heated thus, most of the scales become iridescent and assume, 

 like steel, yellow, orange and blue eolors. I do not know that this reaction has 

 been observed. In. order to ascertain whether every kind of iridosmine gives it, 




114 [June, 



or whether it is peculiar to that from California, I treated some from the Oural 

 Mountains in the same manner, and found that most, but not all of the lead- 

 colored scales are oxydized and assume yellow, orange and blue colors. This 

 reaction seems therefore to be an important one to distinguish Sisserskite from 

 Newjanskite. It is very likely, too, that we find in nature but two combinations 

 of Iridium and Osmium, Ir Os and Ir O34 and that Ir O33 is Ir Os-i mixed with 

 some Ir Os, as it is very difficult to distinguish their color. 



On Strontiano-ccdcite^ a New Mineral. 

 By Dr. F. A. Genth. 



Primitive form an obtuse rhombohedron (as it seems to show cleavage parallel 

 to the planes of a rhombohedron, similar to that of calcite) ; the secondary forms 

 which I observed were the second acute rhombohedron (analogous to that of 

 calcite of 65 50') and its corresponding scalene-dodecahedron. (Crystals micros- 

 copic and not very distinct ; in globular masses formed by an aggregate of rhom- 

 bohedrons, every globule terminating in the above-mentioned acute rhombohe- 

 dron. Fracture uneven. H. =^ 3.5. Sp. gr. == ? 



Colorless and transparent at the points of the aggregations, which are white 

 and translucent. The colorless crystals have a vitreous, the white ones a some- 

 what pearly lustre. 



When heated before the blowpipe it gives out a brilliant light, imparts to the 

 flame a slight crimson color, and is rendered caustic. Easily soluble in acids 

 with disengagement of carbonic acid. The solution gives a white precipitate 

 with sulphate of lime, but not with sulphate of strontia; it therefore contains 

 strontia. After, (in another quantity of the solution,) strontia was precipitated 

 with sulphate of potash, the addition of oxalate of ammonia produced a precipi- 

 tate of oxalate of lime. 



The quantities I had at my disposal were too small to admit of a quantitative 

 analysis, but I presume from the quantities, precipitated with sulphate of potash 

 and oxalate of ammonia, that lime and strontia are contained in Strontiano-calcite 

 in about equal proportions. 



The specimen was presented to me by William Wagner, Esq., who collected 

 it in the neighborhood of Girgenti in Sicily, where it, according to his statement, 

 is of rare occurrence and associated with celestine and sulphur. 



In the chemico-mineralogical system it is to be placed between Dufrenoy's 

 Dreelite and Plumbocalcite. 



Of the carbonates which have isomorphous bases, of carbonate of lime only, 

 two forms, rhombohedron and rhombic prism, have been observed; of carbonate 

 of lead, strontia and baryta, only the rhombic form is known; but when in com- 

 bination with carbonate of lime, they all likewise crystallize in the rhombohe- 

 drical form, thus forming Plumbo-calcite, Strontiano-calcite and Dreelite. It is 

 very likely, that we one of these days will meet with rhombohedrical forms of 

 the pure carbonates of lead, strontia and baryta.

Description. Claws slightly arched, compressed, channel 

 color ; hair, of two kinds, first, a coarse and long hair covering the fur beneath it; 

 second, a dense and very soft fine fUr, composed of hairs that are straight, but 

 crimped and j^vavy, as in the silver gra}' fox. Fur plumbeous at the rqots, 

 gradually becoming dai-k brown towards the tips in those parts of the body which 

 are dark colored on the surface ; in those parts which are white, the fur is white 

 from the roots, and on no part of the animal does it present any annulations. 



The long hairs are dark-brown from the roots, yellowish-white near the mid- 

 dle of their length, and are tipped with black. 



On the under surface the hairs are principally white their whole extent, with 

 a few black ones intermixed; the fur on the tail is rather less fme and more 

 woolly than on the body. 



Feet covered with, soft hair reaching beyond the toes ; on the forehead the hair 

 is rather coarse and short, with fine fur beneath. From this intermixture of 

 hairs the animal is greyish-white on the hea<l, dark-brown on the neck, grayish- 

 brown on the dorsal line and on the sides ; the throat, under surface of the bod}', 

 insides of legs, and feet are black. 



The tail is irregularly banded with dark brown and dull white, the tip white 

 for about three inches. 



Another Specimen. Nose, both surfaces of the legs, and behind the ears, dark 

 reddish-brown; whiskers black; under side of neck, and aline on the belly, liver 

 brown. Fur on the back very fine, and dark ashy-gray from the roots: the 

 longer hairs on the back are black at the roots, and are broadly tipped with white ; 

 fur on the sides, cinereous at the roots, and yellowish-white from thence to the 

 end. 



There is a reddish tinge on the neck, extending to the shoulders ; sides of the 

 face grizzly-brown ; the hair on the tail is irregularly clouded with brown and 

 dull white, and is lightest on the under surface. 



This animal was first noticed, by Lewis and Clarke, as the large red fox of the 

 plains, (vol. 2, p. 168,) and was referred to by us in the first volume of the 

 Quadrupeds of North America, p. 54, where we described it from a hunter's skin. 



Having obtained a beautiful specimen from Captain Rhett, of the United States 

 Army, we now propose for it the name of Vnlpes TJtaJi, as it is, so far as our 

 information extends, chiefly found in the Utah territory, although it probably 

 ranges considerably north of the Great Salt Lake. 



The habits of this beautiful fox are similar to those of the E.ed Fox, and it 

 runs into many varieties of color. 



Captain Rhett informed us that he killed the specimen, kindly presented to us 

 by him, near Fort Larimee. 



Several specimens of Vidpes Utah have been received at the Smithsonian Insti- 

 tution, and it will probably sooa be well known.

Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to a fragment of a fossil ox head, 

 found by Dr. Samuel Brown in a creek 'emptying into the Ohio river, and now 

 deposited in the cabinet of the Academy by the American Philosophical Society. 

 Notwithstanding its larger size and its locality, Cuvier considered it the same as 

 the Bos priscus. Harlan named it Bos latifrons. It belongs to a species of 

 Bison, and is, with very little doubt, distinct from the Bison priscus, and should 

 be called Bison latifrons. 



Another fragment exhibited belonged to a smaller animal. The horn core is 

 relatively more conoidal and curved than in Bison latifrons. The specimen was 

 found at Big-bone-lick, Kentucky, and probably indicates a distinct species, for 

 which the name Bison antiquus was proposed. 



Dr. L. further stated he had been studying the extinct Edentata of North 

 America, and had come to the conclusion, that there were probably four species 

 of Megalonyx, M. Jeffersonii, Harlan, M. laqueatus, Harlan, ?M. potens, Leidyy 

 and M. dissimilis, Leidy ; one species of Mylodon, the M. Harlani, Owen ; and 

 one species of Megatherium, which is probably distinct from that of South 

 America, and might be called with propriety M. mirabile, Leidy. The jaw 

 figured by Prof. Owen, in the Voyage of the Beagle, Foss. Mam. pi. xxix, Dr.L. 

 observed, he was satisfied did not belong to the Megalonyx Jeffersonii, as sup- 

 posed by Mr. Owen, but to a new genus and species, for which the name 

 Gnathopsis Oweni was proposed.

Dr. Owen, in presenting to the Society a specimen of Fusulina Lime- 

 stone, and Tutenmergel, made the following remarks: 



The specimen of Fusulina cylindrica is from the carboniferous limestone on the 

 west side of the Missouri river, below Fort Kearney. One bed ^of limestone 

 there is a complete agglutinated mass of this interesting little foraminiferous 

 shell, which is almost the form and size of a grain of wheat, so that those unac- 

 quainted with the fossil take it to be " petrified wheat. ''^ 



Previous to its discovery on the Missouri river, during the geological survey 

 made by me in 1849, it had been found, I believe, only in isolated specimens in 

 a siliceous stratum towards the base of the coal measures of Ohio. In Europe it 

 has only been found in Russia. Both in this country and Europe it appears to be 

 confined to the carboniferous rocks. 



The specimen of Tutenmergel is from Keeth's Rapid, on the Des Moines river, 

 Iowa, where it occurs in great perfection in ver}' perfect cones with a fine 

 crimped surface, and possessing internally the structure of Arragonite. The Tu- 

 tenmergel of this locality proves to my. mind that its form cannot be due to 

 simple shrinkage of the strata, as believed by most persons, but is a crystalliza- 

 tion, with simultaneous infiltration of calcareous waters a stalactitic formation, 

 not in the atmosphere, but within the substance of its argillaceous matrix. 



The bed at Keeth's Rapid is only four or five inches thick ; but it occurs in 

 much thicker beds nine inches or more lower down near Amsterdam and else- 

 where on the Des Moines, but not in as pure a form, and almost of a black 

 color, while the Keeth bed is almost as colorless as calc spar.

" In the town of Unity, about twelve miles from the place of my residence, is 

 a small body of water known by the name of Cold Fond, It abounds with fish 

 of the kind usually found in such waters, viz., roach, bream, perch and pickerel. 

 They are plump, firm, and well flavored, but almost uneatable in consequence of 

 a peculiarity which I have never observed nor heard of in these kinds of fish in 

 other localities. This peculiarity is that through the bodies of these fish are scat- 

 tered numerous small blackish grains of a globular form, and of about the size of 

 mustard seed, quite hard, and which annoy the teeth so much in the act of masti- 

 cation, as to take away all comfort of eating. Sometimes these little bodies are 

 single, sometimes clustered together more or less. They pervade even the fins 

 and tail, as may be seen by some specimens that I forward in company with this 

 brief sketch. 01 the nature and cause of this unusual condition of the fish, or of 

 the substance of these little pellet?, nothing is known. It has been conjectured 

 that the water of the pond is more or less impregnated, in parts at least consider- 

 ably, by some mineral spring, and that the particles of some mineral held in 

 solution by it, are taken into the circulation of the fish, and by some process of 

 decomposition are deposited in small tubercular aggregations in the various parts 

 of the body."

 Phocnixville Moljbdate of Lead, reported in favor of publication in the

Further Examiiiatioii, oj the P hccnixville Molybdale of head. 



By Charles M. Wetherill, Ph. D. 



In the Proceedings for the 30th March of this year, is a description of a red 

 variety of Molybdate of Lead, examined qualitatively by me, and in which it is 

 stated that I could not detect chromium either by the moist way, or before the 

 blow pipe. In the July number of Silliman's Journal, page 105, among the min- 

 eralogical notices by Mr. W. T. Blake, he observes that the specimens from the 

 Wheatley mine, which he mistook for chromate of lead, have been found to be the 

 molybdate containing chromic acid. I find also in Dana's Mineralogy, under the 

 head of this mineral, the observation that " a red variety contains a few per cent, 

 of chromic acid." In my former analysis I looked particularly for this acid 

 without finding it. Supposing that Mr. Blake had been more fortunate than my- 

 self, I repeated the examination on larger quantities of mineral, and with great 

 care, but have no reason to change what was before written. About one deci- 

 gramme of the pulverized molybdate was dissolved in boiling concentrated hydro- 

 chloric acid. No chlorine could be detected, as would have been the case were 

 chromic acid present. After boiling for some time to reduce the hypothetical 

 acid to sesquioxide of chromium, enough water was added to dissolve the formed 

 chloride of lead, and then sulphuric acid in excess. The solution was yellow, and 

 when drops of the liquid had reached the hot sides of the capsule the blue molybde- 

 num compound was formed, which gave with the yellow solution a green tinge to 

 those parts. The lead being thus separated in combination with sulphuric acid, 

 to the filtrate was added hydrosulphuret of ammonium, which kept in solution 

 the sulphnret of molybdenum thus formed, and precipitated sulphuret of iron, which 

 should contain sesquioxide of chromium, if chromic acid were in the mineral. 

 This sulphuret of iron was removed from the solution, oxidized by nitric acid, 

 precipitated hot by ammonia, then washed, and the ashes of the filter fused with 

 nitre and carbonate of soda. The result was the slightest shade greenish, as if 

 from the presence of minute traces of manganese, but not in the least yellow, nor 

 did it give a yellow solution with water, nor did the solution, neutralized exactly 

 by ammonia and nitric acid, give, as would be the case with chromic acid, the 

 purple red precipitate of the chromate of silver on addition of the nitrate. The 

 reactions of chromium are so decided that the presence of this metal could hardly 

 escape the notice of one looking for it. I have not yet been able to obtain a suf- 

 ficient quantity of the mineral for a quantitative examination. This compound 

 may possibly be an acid molybdate, analogous to many chromates which when 

 neutral are yellow, and red when acid. 



The Committee on the following paper by Dr. Wetherill, reported in 

 favor of publication in the Proceedings. 



Chemical Examination of the Food of the Quee7i Bee. 



By Charles M. Wetherill, Ph. D. 



A specimen was given to me by Dr. Leidy, from Mr. Langstroth, of the food 

 of the ^|Ueen bee. It was an oblong mass, consisting of two differently colored 

 layers, the inner one horn-like and transparent, the outer whitish and more 

 opaque. Under the microscope, with high powers, it appears amorphous. It was 




120 [July, 



heavier than water, of the consistenc}' of wax, hut sticky and elastic. It contains 

 Wax, which is in larger quantity in the white than in the inner layer. Heated on 

 the platinum foil a portion of the body melts and flows to another part of the 

 platinum, where by further heating it diffuses the odor of wax. The residue does 

 not melt, but swells up by greater heat, with a smell of burned leather, and leaves 

 a porous coke, burning off with great difficulty, and with a slight ash. The sub- 

 stance in warm water is softened and partly dissolves, leaving white insoluble 

 flakes; the filtrate gives a precipitate on boiling, which precipitate does not melt 

 by heat, nor is it soluble in alcohol or ether. The original substance does not 

 dissolve in alcohol or ether, but in the latter menstruum is covered on the sur- 

 face with a white coating. In warm dilutfe hydrochloric acid it is slightly attacked, 

 but not completely dissolved. Tested for nitrogen by Lassaigne's method, by 

 fusion with sodium and obtaining the precipitate of Prussian blue, it indicated the 

 presence of considerable quantities of that element. As the body appears to be 

 composed of at least three substances, and the quantity at my disposal weighed 

 but three decigrammes, I was unable to subject it to an ultimate analysis. 



From its reactions it appears to contain, besides wax, albumen and protein 

 compounds. It is truly a bread containing albuminous compounds, which 

 would probably prove, on analysis, similar to the gluten of wheat, for the nourish- 

 ment of the plastic organs of the body. The examination of this substance was 

 interesting in connection with the Mexican ant honey. The latter contains 

 no nitrogen, and would therefore seem incapable alone of affording nourishment 

 to the young insect, as supposed by some, and which young, in the case of bees, 

 are fed by pollen. Perhaps the accumulation of honey in the ant is the result of 

 a disease like diabetes ; though it would seem improbable that it should be a dis- 

 ease so widely diffused. These ants do not, I suppose, make wax or an analogous 

 substance, which is the use of the tioney of the bee. 



The examination of compounds occurring in the lower animals, which are also 

 the result of the decomposition of amylaceous and albuminous substances, and a 

 comparison of these compounds with the animal's food, has been much neglected 

 by chemists. Yet it would seem that the study of certain decompositions deemed 

 physiologically important, could be more readily carried out upon those lower 

 orders whose organs are less complex. The food of animals is in general very 

 similar, as well in the percentage proportion of its constituents as in the rational 

 formulae of its elements. It consists, as is well known, of nitrogenized com- 

 pounds for formation, and amylaceous ones for respiration. The amylaceous 

 compounds, in particular, have been well studied in all their transformations out 

 of the body, and to a certain extent as occurring in man and in a few animals. 

 The three principal radicals of this class, amyl, ethyl, and formyl, and their 

 compounds and derivatives, are well known. It is therefore significant, and sug- 

 gestive of further research, when we find the three acids of their alcohol radicals 

 in the animal, as valerianic in the oil of Delphinus globiceps, acetic in man, &c., 

 and formic in the ant ; these acids and other products of decomposition of the 

 three radicals being besides found in other animals and in plants, and some in a 

 diseased state of plant or animal. If it be desirable to study that mysterious 

 force, the vital, how can it be done but by its effects, for which nature must be 

 cross-examined in her every form. This is the more important, as we find vitality 

 to determine the resolution of the same food into different products in different 

 animals, as may be required for their existence. We have a beautiful example 

 of this in the case of the bee. One of the simplest transformations of an organic 

 compound is that of cane to grape sugar ; it requires merely the absorption of two 

 equivalents of water by the former. Grape sugar appears by the phenomena of 

 fermentation to be more readily decomposable than cane sugar ; and we accord- 

 ingly find this change taking place in the body of the bee in the formation of its 

 honey, which is to be worked up again into wax. When cane sugar is given to 

 bees for the formation of wax, wax is indeed formed, but apparently with more 

 difficulty, and does not detach itself readily as in vsax from honey. This excre- 

 ment of honey compared with food is probably the simplest occurring in animal 

 life. 




18520 '. ' 121 



The relation of food to respiration and nourishment in man and kindred ani- 

 mals has been well set forth by Liebig in his Animal Chemistry. According to 

 this author, an equivalent of starch is changed into fat by losing one equivalent 

 of carbonic acid, and seven equivalents of oxygen. Now, since wax bears a great 

 analogy to the fats, it may be supposed to be derived from honey in a similar manner. 

 Wax composed of cerine and myricine has a composition of C34H34O2 ; anhydrous 

 grape sugar C12H12O12, or three equivalents C36H36O36, two equivalents carbonic 

 acid, two of water, and twenty-eight oxygen ; three equivalents of grape sugar 

 would yield one of wax. That wax is produced from honey is shown by Grund- 

 laeh, (Natural History of Bees,) as quoted by Liebig. The air in the hive during 

 the formation of wax should contain an excess of oxygen, which has not been 

 shown by analysis, that 1 am aware of. 



Grundlach supposes that honey is alone necessary to the support of bees with- 

 out nitrogenized substances like pollen, and instances the fact that bees often 

 starve in April when their honey is consumed, and when they can obtain pollen 

 from the fields, but no honey. But this, perhaps, only proves that much honey is 

 necessary to their existence, owing no doubt to the large expenditure in the for- 

 mation of wax, and which is not voluntary but continually going on. For the 

 same author has observed that bees shut up and fed without a queen, will not 

 build up honey comb, although the wax laminae will continue to be secreted from 

 their bodies. If there is any analogy between bees and the vertebrata, that 

 nitrogenized compounds are as necessary to the formation of the plastic organs as 

 the non-nitrogenized are to the respiration, (and it would seem thus probable from 

 the fact that the queen bee, the fruit of whose labor requires much nitrogen, 

 lives on highly nitrogenized food,) it seems as incredible that bees should be sup- 

 ported entirely by honey, as that man should be by starch only. 



A careful examination of the relation between food and its transformation in 

 the bodies of such animals, would no doubt throw great light upon mooted points 

 in physiology ; and the many differences in the nature of the products, which 

 could no doubt be reconciled with the laws of chemistry, would in themselves 

 afford one of the strongest proofs in favor of the theories with which they 

 might agree.

Primitive form most probably hexagonal ; sometimes small six-sided laminas. 

 Cleavage basal, eminent. Usually in masses consisting of foliated scales. 



H = 2-5. Sp. gr. (at 77*^ F.) = 2-617. 



Color of fine scales between greyish and silver-white and peach-blossom red ; 

 masses of the latter color. Streak reddish white. Lustre pearly. Subtrans- 

 parent ; subtranslucent. Scales flexible, but not elastic. The powder greasy 

 to the touch. 



Yields water in the matrass. Heated before the blowpipe, it becomes silver- 

 white, with a greyish-green tint ; small scales are rounded at the edges, and 

 become brownish from the oxidation of the iron ; dissolves in borax and micro- 

 cosmic salt, and gives in both flames emerald green beads ; by the latter reagent 

 a skeleton of silicic acid is separated; with soda in the oxidizing flame it forms 

 a yellow mass. Hydrochloric acid apparently does not act upon it ; sulphuric 

 acid acts slowly upon the fine powder, but the mineral previously heated to red- 

 ness is almost completely decomposed by it, with separation of silicic acid as 

 a jelly.

Composition : 3 (RO, Si O3) + 2 (R2 O3, SiOa) + 9 (MgO, HO.) According 

 to analysis it contains : 



100-59 101-09 



Found near Texas in Lancaster county, associated with chromic iron, gymnite, 

 nickel-gymnite and other minerals. 



Considering sesquioxide of chromium and alumina as isomorphous bases, and 

 in the same manner oxide of iron and the small quantities of alkalies isomor- 

 phous with magnesia, the oxygen ratio of 



3 (RO, SiOs) + 2 (R2O3, Si03) 4. 9(MgO, HO). 



In the chemico-mineralogical system, this mineral is to be placed among 

 the Silicates of bases RO -\- R'i Os -{- Hydrates, and it has some relation 

 to Chlorite and Ripidolite. Besides, most of its physical and chemical proper- 

 ties seem to be identical with Fiedler's Rhodochrom, a mineral from Tino in 

 Greece and some localities in the Oural Mountains, which by G. Rose is consi- 

 dered a serpentine, containing a large quantity of chromium ; but the latter has 

 a greenish-black color, and dissolves in hydrochloric acid. As no quantitative 

 analysis of it has been published, further examinations have to prove what rela- 

 tions exist between these minerals. I at least consider it useless to speak about 

 identity, if it cannot be proved by analysis. 



Another mineral, much resembling Rhodophyllite, but of a different composi- 

 tion, is Kammererite. 



In the following I will give a brief report of the data of the analysis, and the 

 modes which were adopted in separating the different ingredients.

IV. 2.6148 grammes gave : 



Water 0-3344 grammes. 



In analysis No. I. the fine powder was fused in a platinum crucible with car- 

 bonate of soda and nitrate of potash ; the fused mass was decomposed by hydro- 

 chloric acid, and evaporated to dryness ; the dry mass moistened with hydro- 

 chloric acid, heated and filtered. The silicic acid, thus separated, containing 

 still a small quantity of chromium, etc., was fused a second time by carbonate of 

 soda, and treated as above; the solution containing the small quantity of chro- 

 mium was added to the other part. The acid liquid containing in solution the 

 sesquioxides of chromium and iron, alumina and magnesia, was very nearly 

 neutralized by carbonate of soda, and precipitated by carbonate of baryta. The 

 mixture was often stirred, and after two days filtered. The weaker bases were 

 completely precipitated, and did not contain a trace of magnesia. The precipi- 

 tate of alumina, the sesquioxides of iron and chromium, and the excess of car- 

 bonate of baryta, were treated with sulphuric acid and the soluble sulphates 

 filtered from the insoluble sulphate of baryta. The filtrate was precipitated by 

 ammonia and boiled, to prevent the dissolution of sesquioxide of chromium. This 

 precipitate, after having been filtered and dried, was finely powdered, and fused 

 with carbonate of soda and nitrate of potash, in order to oxidize the sesquioxide 

 of chromium into chromic acid. From the solution in water alumina was preci- 

 pitated by carbonate of ammonia. The filtrate was then acidulated with hydro- 

 chloric acid, the chromic acid reduced by alcohol, and the sesquioxide of chro- 

 mium precipitated from the boiling solution by ammonia. 



After baryta had been separated by sulphuric acid from the filtrate of the weak 

 bases, magnesia was precipitated from the ammoniacal solution by phosphate of 

 ammonia, with the requisite precautions. In analysis No. III. I decomposed 

 the finely powdered mineral (previously heated to redness) by evaporation with 

 sulphuric acid. The silicic acid not having a white color, was fused with car- 

 bonate of soda and nitrate of potash as above, and the solution containing 

 alumina, sesquioxides of chromium and iron, and magnesia added to the other 

 parts. The sesquioxides were separated from magnesia by carbonate of baryta. 



The solution containing the magnesia, from which baryta was separated by 

 sulphuric acid, and to which an excess of chloride of ammonium had been added, 

 gave with ammonia a white gelatinous precipitate, which was insoluble in caustic 

 potash, but it gave the other reactions of magnesia. In analyzing this mineral 

 1 tried at first to separate magnesia from the sesquioxides by chloride of ammo- 

 nium and ammonia, but although I had ounces of ammoniacal salts in solution, 

 only half of the magnesia (17 per cent.) remained in solution. I dissolved and 

 precipitated thus three times, but at last I had to give it up, and separated the 

 balance which was remaining with the weak bases by carbonate of baryta. I 

 never before had such difficulties in separating alumina from magnesia, and H. 

 Rose, in his newest edition, is still in favor of this method, and separated the 

 small quantity of magnesia, which always falls down With the alumina, by dis- 

 solving the latter in caustic potash. I shall make further experiments with the 

 magnesia separated from Rhodophyllite, and intend to make communication of 

 my results to the Academy, if I find them interesting enough. 



For the estimation of the alkalies, the mineral, previously heated to redness, 

 was decomposed by sulphuric acid, the soluble sulphates were boiled with car- 

 bonate of baryta, and the carbonates of the alkalies with traces of magnesia 

 extracted by water. The solution v/as evaporated to dryness, dissolved and 

 filtered from som.e magnesia which remained ; but the last trace of it was sepa= 

 rated by oxide of mercury after the carbonates were converted into chlorides. 




124 [August, 



The chlorides were weighed together, dissolved in water, and on the addition 

 of bichloride of platinum evaporated to dryness, and the rennaining double salt 

 of bichloride of platinum and potassium extracted by alcohol. This salt was 

 heated to redness (as its quantity was very small,) and the platinum separated 

 by water from the chloride of potassium. From the quantity of platinum, that 

 of potash and chloride of potassium was calculated, and the latter subtracted 

 from the whole amount of alkali-metals. The difference is the weight of 

 chloride of sodium and lithium, but their quantity is too small for a correct 

 analysis. From reactions it was supposed that the mineral contained about 

 equal proportions of those. Fluorine and phosphoric or boracic acid could not 

 be detected.

SECOND PART, 



Containing the species of the Saurian order, collected by John H. Clark, under 

 Col. J. D. Graham, head of the Scientific Corps U. S. and Mexican Boundary 

 Conamission, and a few others from the same or adjoining territories, obtained 

 from other sources, and mentioned under their special headings. 



Holbrookia texana, B. and G. Cophosaurus texanusy Trosch. Arch, fiir 

 Naturg. for 1850, (published in 1852,) 389. Tab. VI. 



This species, easily distinguished from H. maculatay attains a larger size and 

 is provided with a more elongated tail. The body above and the lower surface 

 of the head are grayish, maculated with small yellowish white subcircular dots ; 

 on the upper surface of the tail and hind legs there are transverse bands of black. 

 On the posterior half of the abdomen there are two black crescents, the convexity 

 of which is posterior, and extending from near the back to the belly, without 

 coming into contact either above or below. The space between the crescents, 

 as well as an anterior and posterior area, are yellowish white on the back and 

 blue on the belly. The breast, the medial line of the belly, the inferior surface 

 of thighs and tail, are unicolor, of a uniform yellowish white; the tail underneath 

 presents seven or more large subquadrangular or subcircular black patches. In 

 the female, the abdominal crescents are represented by two lateral spots. 



Localities. Along the Rio San Pedro, a tributary of the Rio Grande del Norte. 



Holbrookia affinis, B. and G. This species comes nearest to H. texana^ 

 from which however it can be readily distinguished by its more slender form and 

 its proportionally larger dorsal scales and superciliary plates. The coloration 

 differs but little from the former in the female, to which sex the only specimen 

 in our possession belongs. The back however is darker, scattered with black 

 spots, of which two dorsal rows may be followed from the occiput to the base of 

 the tail, where they meet and constitute a crescent or an angle, the convexity of 



20 




126 [August, 



which is directed backwards. The tail underneath is provided with black patches 

 similar to those in H. texana. 



Locality. Found with the preceding species. 



HoLBRooKiA PROPiNQUA, B. and G. This species, very closely allied to H. 

 mactilata, is most readily distinguished by a more slender form of body and a 

 more elongated tail. Another character is found in the possession of a more 

 depressed and protruding snout. On the sides of the abdomen there are some- 

 times two, but generally three, black patches, whilst in H. maculata these con- 

 ditions are reversed. 



Localities, Between Indianola and San Antonio (Texas.) We possess one 

 individual of the same species, collected by R. H. Kern, Esq., in a more south- 

 westerly locality. 



HoLBRooKiA MACULATA, G. Specimens of this species were obtained on the 

 boundary line between San Antonio (Texas) and El Paso del Norte, thus extend- 

 ing greatly its geographical range. 



Crotaphytus Gambelii, B. and G. Of the size, shape and general appear- 

 ance of G. Wislizenii, from which however it can be readily distinguished by 

 the larger scales both on the back and belly. The head is likewise more ovoidal ; 

 at any rate the plates which cover its surface are larger, especially on the occipi- 

 tal region. The scales on the sides of the head are larger than in C. Wislizenii, 

 especially those of the temporal region. The general distribution of color is 

 the same as in C Wislizenii; the only difference consists in the absence of the 

 small yellowish white dots spread all over the body of the latter species. The 

 transverse yellowish markings appear also to be more conspicuous. 



Locality. Not precisely known; collected by the late Dr. Wm. Gambel 

 during his last visit to California. Specimens also in the Academy of Natural 

 Sciences. 



CROTAPHYTUS DORSALis, B. and G. A small and very characteristic species. 

 The snout is short, truncated or rather rounded, giving to the head a much greater 

 resemblance to that of C. collaris than to that of either O. Wislizenii or C. 

 Gambelii. The scales are proportionally larger than in any of the known species 

 of the genus. Along the dorsal line, a row of still larger and carinated scales, 

 constitutes another very distinctive mark between this species and the others, its 

 congeners. The tail seems rather compressed and is one and a half times the length 

 of the body. The ground color nbove is bluish brown with crowded yellowish- 

 white subcircular spots. The tail is alternately serai-annulated with bluish- 

 brown and yellowish-white. The lower part of the body is unicolor, except 

 under the head, where there are several narrow and oblique bluish streaks. 

 Locality. Desert of Colorado, California. Collected by Dr. John L. LeConte. 

 This species, according to the notes of Dr. LeConte, in running, carries its 

 body very high above the ground, with the tail frequently elevated over the back, 

 somewhat like a squirrel. It runs with very great swiftness, over the sand, 

 making for its hole whenever pursued. 



Uta ornata, B. and G. This species maybe distinguished from U. Stanshn- 

 riana, of which it has the general appearance, by a dorsal space covered with 

 five or six rows of scales larger than those on the sides of the body. Along the 

 middle of the sides there exists one row of small scutollac imitating the lateral 

 line in lishes. The ground color is reddish-brown with transversely elongated 

 black patches all along the upper part of the body and tail. The belly is uni- 

 color in the female, whilst it is blue in the male. 



Localities. On the Rio San Pedro (Texas) and province of Sonora. Speci- 

 mens of the same species were collected by Dr. John L. LeConte at San Diego 

 (Cal.) and San Francisco (Cal.) 



ScELOPORUs PoiNSEXTii, B. and G. Sc. torqnatus var. B. Wiegm.? This 

 species, although more intimately related to Sc. torqnatus than to any other of 

 the same genus, is nevertheless easily distinguishable from the latter by the form 

 and structure of the scales on the middle region of the back, which are subcircu- 




1852.] 127 



lar, very thin, without carinae and finely denticulated posteriorly. On the sides, 

 the upper part of the legs and on the tail, the scales taper posteriorly into a sharp 

 point. The plates on the upper surface of the head are rather small and irregu- 

 lar in shape, except the occipital, which is larger than in any other allied species. 

 The general color is olivaceous, reddish on the back and sides, with transverse 

 dorsal black bands, much broaSer and more distinct on the tail. There is also a 

 black collar convex backwards, embracing the region of the neck above and 

 terminating in advance of the origin of the fore legs. 



At the request of Col. J. D. Graham, we have dedicated this species to the 

 memory of the late Hon. Joel R, Poinsett, whose name is associated with the 

 progress of science and the useful arts throughout his public career, especially 

 while Secretary of War of the United States. 



Localities. Rio San Pedro of the Rio Grande del Norte, and the province of 

 Sonora. 



ScELopoRus Clarkii, B. and G. Allied to bothSc. torquatus^n^Sc. spinosus, 

 it resembles the former in the presence of an imperfect black collar, which is 

 more distinct in the young. This, however, is never seen to form a complete 

 crescent on the neck, but is gradually diminishing in width from its origin in 

 advance of the fore legs towards the upper part of the body. From Sc. spinosus 

 it differs by having proportionally much larger scales on the temporal region, and 

 all the scales terminated by a much less developed posterior point. The body is 

 uniform yellowish green, excepting the band of black on the sides of the head. 

 The male has a bluish abdomen, indistinctly black along the middle region. The 

 lower surface of the head is blue, on the middle region surrounded with black. 



Dedicated to John H. Clark, to whose skill as a collector, and untiring zeal for 

 science, the world is indebted for the splendid zoological collections sent and 

 brought home by Col. Graham from the survey of the Mexican boundary. 



Locality. Province of Sonora. 



ScELOPORus Thayerii, B. and G. This species has the general appearance of 

 Se. scalaris and Sc. graciosus. It differs from both by a very readily apprecia- 

 ble character, which consists in the possession of much larger scales on the upper 

 region of the body. The color is yellowish green above, with two longitudinal 

 bands of brown or black, and two yellow ones, on each side. Sometimes, instead 

 of bands, a series of small patches of the same color is observed, the black 

 patches also form transverse and undulating narrow bands. The belly is uniform 

 yellow underneath, the male has on each side an elongated patch of blue, with a 

 narrow band of black along the abdominal margin. Under the throat there is a 

 medial black patch, limiting on each side another blue spot. 



At the request of Col. Graham likewise, we have dedicated this species to Col. 

 Sylvanus Thayer, of the U. S. Engineer corps, and the founder of the present 

 system of instruction at the U. S. Military Academy at West Point, as a tribute 

 to the high scientific attainments and valuable services in his profession as an 

 officer. 



Localities. Indianola, on the Gulf of Mexico, San Antonio, (Texas,) El Paso 

 del Norte, and as far westward as the province of Sonora. 



ScELOPORus DisPAR, B. and G. No species of the genus Sceloporus will be 

 more easily recognizable than the present one, on account of the great disparity 

 which exists between the scales on the upper part of the body and those on the 

 tail, the latter being twice as large and more strongly carinate-d. The scales on 

 the abdomen are likewise a little larger than those on the back. The color in the 

 only specimen which we have hitherto seen of this species is uniform blackish 

 green, but as it has been collected for a long time, the color may have changed 

 considerably. The head is reddish brown. The abdomen in the male is blue 

 from the fore to the hind legs, leaving a medial narrow space of the color of the 

 throat and thighs, and along which a narrow black band separates it from the 

 blue. 



Locality. Vera Cruz. Sent by Dr. Burroughs to the Academy of Natural 

 Scinces of Philadelphia, where the specimen described is preserved. 




128 [August, 



Genus Cnemidophorus. 



A. With eight rows of abdominal scales. 



Cnemidophorus marmoratus, B. and G. This species is so closely allied to 

 Cn. tigris figured in Stansbury's Report on the great Salt Lake, that, at first 

 sight, it is difficult to perceive the differences. These consist in the proportional 

 size of the scales, which are smaller on the back and larger on the tail and belly, 

 in Cn. marmorams than in Cn. tigris. The head is broader on the vertex in Cn, 

 marmoratus than in Cn. tigris. Differences in the shape of the cephalic plates 

 are likew^ise obvious when the two species are compared. The hind legs are 

 more developed in Cn. marmoratus than in Cn. tigris, the scales which cover 

 their under surface are larger and extend over a greater area. The ground color 

 is yellowish green, marbled with black, except on the head and posterior part of 

 the tail. 



Locality. Between San Antonio (Texas) and El Paso del Norte. 



Cnemidophorus Grahamii, B. and G. This is a large and beautiful species, 

 strongly suggestive of Cn. tigris, from vihich. it differs by a much smaller and 

 narrower head, and by some differences in the proportional size of the cephalic 

 plates. The scales on the upper region of the body are still more minute than in 

 Cn. marmoratus. Those on the margin of the subgular fold are much larger than 

 in either Cn. tigris and Cn. marm,oratiis. The head is olivaceous ; the ground 

 color of the body reddish-green, with seven or eight longitudinal series of sub- 

 quadrangular black dots, constituting sometimes continuous bands. This species 

 is dedicated to the accomplished officer to whom the U. S. and Mexican boundary 

 survey was, for a short time, entrusted. His name has long been associated 

 with the progress of science in the United States, from the date of the first ex- 

 pedition of Major Long, to the present time, and we take great pleasure in ten- 

 dering this especial mark of respect. 



Locality. Found with the preceding species. 



CNEMmoPHORUS GULARis, B. and G. Allied to Cn. sexlineatuSf of which it 

 has the general appearance. The body, however, is shorter, the fore and hind 

 legs are more developed, and the scales on the upper region of the body smaller 

 than in the latter species. Another very striking difference is to be found on the 

 subgular fold, where the marginal scales are considerably larger than in Cn. 

 sexlineatus. 



Localities. From Indianola, (Texas,) and the valley of the Rio San Pedro, a 

 tributary of the Rio Grande del Norte. 



Cnemidophorus perplexus, B. and G. This species has the general appear- 

 ance of C71. Grahamii, having like the latter a proportionally small and narrow 

 head, which distinguishes at once these from both Cn. tigris and Cn. marmoratus. 

 From Cn. Grahamii it differs by the absence of large scales on the margin of the 

 subgular fold. The scales on the upper part of the body are nearly the same, 

 but those on the belly are larger in Cn. 'perplexus than in Cn. Grahaviii. The 

 ground color is yellowish green, with seven yellowish stripes extending from the 

 occiput to the origin of the tail. 



Localities. Valley of the Rio San Pedro of the Rio Grande del Norte. Speci- 

 mens were also collected by Gen. Churchill, on the Rio Grande west of San 

 Antonio, (Texas,) and by Dr. William Gambel on his last journey to California. 



Cnemidophorus gracilis, B. and G. This species comes nearer to Cn. per- 

 plexus than 10 any other of the same genus, but the head is still narrower, the 

 body, tail, and legs slender, and proportionally more elongated. The scales on 

 the lower surface of the head and throat are much smaller than in Cn. perplexus. 

 The color is bluish black above, with four yellowish white narrow stripes extend- 

 ing from the occiput to the origin of the tail. 



Locality. Desert of Colorado; collected by Dr. John L. Le Conte. 




1852.] 129 



B, With ten rows of abdominal scales. 



Cnemidophorus PRAESiGNis, B. and G. Ten longitudinal rows of abdominal 

 scales, quadrangular, broader than long. Two subguttural folds, the surface of 

 the posterior one covered with scales of medium size. A transverse band of 

 similar scales extends from one ear opening to the other. Nostrils between the 

 suture of two plates. Scales on the upper part of the body proportionally small; 

 on the tail, elongated, narrow and keeled. The middle region of the back is 

 greenish brown, exhibiting an indistinct medial streak with irregular quadrangles 

 of the same color on each side, separated by a narrow band of deep black. The 

 sides are black, provided with two narrow stripes of yellowish white on each and 

 extending along the tail. Between these stripes, and specially along the abdomen, 

 irregular dots of the color of the stripes are seen scattered. The hind legs and 

 tail are variegated with black and bluish spots. 



Locality. From Chagres, collected by Prof. C. B. Adams. Said' to be also 

 common at Panama. 



Plestiodon obsoletuMj B.and G. Total length about nine inches. Body and 

 limbs rather short and stout ; tail longer than the body, conical, and rapidly 

 tapering away. Parieto-occipital and vertical the largest of all the cephalic 

 plates; rostral, labials, and temporal ones considerably developed. General color 

 greenish white; uniform below ; the scales on the back and sides are thinly mar- 

 ginated with black. 



Locality. Valley of the Rio San Pedro of the Rio Grande del Norte. 



Elgaria nobilis, B. and G. This is the most beautiful species of the 

 genus. The body and tail are slender and elongated ; the limbs slender and 

 rather short. The ventral shields are twelve rowed ; fourteen longitudinal rows 

 of scales on the back, obscurely keeled. The ground color is olivaceous ; the 

 upper surface of the head, the belly and lower surface of the tail, are dotted with 

 black. From the occiput to the origin of the tail, there are nine or ten trans- 

 verse blackish brown bands on the back, covering two or three rows of scale?, 

 margined posteriorly with white. The intermediate spaces between these brown 

 bands are of the same width as the bands themselves. Upwards of twenty brown 

 half-rings are observed on the tail, the width of which is a little less than the 

 intermediate spaces. 



Locality. Fort Webster, Copper mines of the Gila, (Santa Rita del Cobre,) 

 New Mexico.

Remarks upon the Coccinellid^ of the United States. 

 By John L. Le Conte, M. D. 



It is not my intention on this occasion to present a synopsis or catalogue of the 

 native species belonging to the present group. The very elaborate and carefully 

 written work of Mulsant* renders such a labor entirely superfluous. I propose 

 now merely to present some views on the classification of the genera of this 

 family, and to add descriptions of the new species which have recently been 

 obtained. 



On account of the difficulty of distinguishing the species of Scymnus, I have 

 made new descriptions of all the species observed ; the Corylophi, with but a 

 single exception, are new, and I have, therefore, by adding a new description of 

 that species, completed a monograph of that division of the present family.

[August, 



Although the labors of Mulsant have served to establish many natural groups 

 among the species of this difficult tribe, I can by no means agree with him re- 

 garding the generic value of such groups. However constant may be the char- 

 acters used by him, yet they are entirely too unimportant to be used for sepa- 

 rating species, otherwise closely allied. A genus to be natural must differ from 

 its neighbors by some decided modification of structure, accompanied with a re- 

 cojjnizable difference in external form : and although it maybe convenient to give 

 names to subordinate groups, yet they canl n no case be admitted as ger>era. 



For this reason, I find it impossible to adopt Mulsant's numerous genera, and 

 therefore present the following table as showing the relations between such of 

 our native genera, as appear to be really separated by trenchant and recognizable 

 characters.

2. H. Mulsanti, nigra, thorace subconvexo, antrorsum angnstato, subtilis- 

 sime punctulato, margine lateral! et apicali albo, elytris rufo-flavis, fascia sub 

 basali, macula magna obliqua pone mediam, alteraque versus apicem nigris. 

 Long. -22. 



One specimen, Pic River, Lake Superior. Very similar to H. 5-signata 

 (Muls.) but differs by its convex and less punctured thorax being narrowed in 

 I'ront, and margined with white on the sides and apex. The large posterior spot 

 of the elytra is more oblique, and is a little narrower at its external part : the 

 epimera are white. 



In the only specimen of H. 5-signata in my collection, the thorax, besides the 

 large white blotches at the anterior angles, has two small white dorsal spots, and 

 one at the middle of the apex. 



3. H. a m b i g u a , nigra, thorace punctulato, margine laterali et antico, macu- 

 lisque dorsalibus duabus plus minusve albis, elytris valde punctulatis rufis, ad 

 baain albidis, sutura basi nigra. Lorij. '2 27. 



California and Oregon. Very similar to H. convergens, but easily distinguished 

 by the stronirly punctulate elytra : the elytra are usually without spots, sometimes 

 there is a single black dot on each at the anterior fifth near the sutnre. The 

 thorax varies as follows : 



at. Lateral and apical margin narrow, white ; dorsal spots small, distinct. 



^. Lateral margin white, dilated at the anterior angles ; dorsal spots none. 



4. H. p u n c t u 1 a t a, nigra, thorace valde punctulato, maculis duabus dorsa- 

 libus, alteris ad angulos anticos, margineque apicali medio prolongato albis, 

 elytris punctulatis, rufis basi pallidis, sutura antice nigra. Long '27. 



Several specimens, San Francisco, California. Very similai^ to the preceding, 

 but the thorax is more strongly punctured and more convex ; the white of the 

 sides extends only half way to the base, and the apical white margin, even 

 W'hen not entire, is prolonged a little in the middle ; the dorsal spots are some- 

 times wanting ; the posterior angles are sometimes marked with a small white 

 point. 



This species and the preceding have been confounded w^ith unspotted varieties 

 of H. convergens, from which their strongly punctulate elytra at once distin- 

 guish them. 



5i H. maculata Lee; Cocc mamlata De Geer; C. \Q-mac2data'F^hr.\ 

 C. oblonga Oliv. ; Megilla maculata Muls. 28. This species is common in the 

 southern part of California. One specimen from New York is more strongly- 

 punctured on the elytra than any other I have seen, but I can find no other 

 difference. 



CocciNELLA Linne. 



Our species fall into three natural divisions according to the form of the en- 

 closed spaces of the first abdominal segment, behind the coxae. I have latinised 

 Mulsant's "plaques abdominales " into " scuta abdominis;" Redtenbacher's 

 " Schenkellinie " is more appropriate, but is not so easily translated,

Lake Superior, several specimens. This species very closely resembles C. 




132 [August, 



montlcola (Muls. 115), but the elytra have the lateral margin from the humeri 

 to the middle broadly sulcate, while in C. monticola the same part is scarcely 

 perceptibly copcave ; the black transverse spois of the elytra are also larger. 

 Otherwise there is no special difference. 



Myzia Muls. 



This genus differs from Coccinella by its long and slender antennae ; I have 

 included in it also Mulsant's genus Anatis, as I can find no difference worthy 

 of note. The following is new : 



1. M. Rathvoni, late ovata, ntrinque fortius angustata, thorace lateribus 

 rectis, maculis duabus baseos lateribusque late albis, his puncto nigro notatis, 

 elytris piceo-rufis, lateribus usque ad medium explanatis. Long. -4. 



I take great pleasure in dedicating 'this fine species to Mr. S. S. Rathvon, of 

 Lancaster, Pa., to whom science is indebted for many valuable additions to our 

 entomological fauna. It was found at Sacramento, California, by Mr. Childs. 

 Broadly oval, very convex, strongly narrowed before and behind, so as to be al- 

 most angulated at the middle, on the sides. Head black, with an obscure rufous 

 spot each side. Thorax twice as wide as long, strongly narrowed in front, 

 sides nearly straight, broadly margined ; black, with two basal spots and a very 

 broad lateral margin white ; the sides have a marginal black spot near the pos- 

 terior angles. Elytra piceo-rufous, with some very indistinct black dots, of 

 which the posterior series consisting as in M. 15-punctata of 6 spots is most 

 distinct ; the lateral margin from the base to the point of greatest breadth is 

 strongly flattened and concave, and is blackish towards the middle. Beneath 

 black. 



This is evidently a very dark colored specimen, and it is probable that on 

 further exploration varieties will be found similar to the light colored and ocel- 

 late specimens of M. 15-punctata. 



COCCIDULA Kug. 



1. C. lepida, elongato-oblonga, flava, subtiliter albo-pubescente, capita 

 pectoreque nigris, elytris disperse punctatis, basi, lateribus ad medium, macula-

One specimen, Vermont. Prof. C. B. Adams. Oblong elongate, convex, 

 bright yellow, covered with fine short white hair. Head black, finely and not 

 densely punctured, clypeus, mouth and antennae yellow. Thorax finely punc- 

 tured, rounded on the sides, base rounded, posterior angles subobtuse, not 

 rounded. Elytra tolerably coarsely punctured, base and sides as far as the 

 middle black ; black portion broader at the scutellum and at the middle of the side ; 

 disc with a common rounded black spot at the second third ; beneath yellow ; 

 breast entirely black ; prosternum black posteriorly. 



The anterior coxae in this genus are much smaller than in any other of the 

 present tribe, and are almost round. 



ExocHOMus Redt.

Louisiana. 1 have dedicated this species to my estimable friend Mr. J. A. 

 Guex, to whom I owe my specimens of this and many other interesting species. 

 Size and form of E. marginipennis (Muls.) (E. prcetextatus Mels. Pr. Ac. 3, 178 ; 

 Cocc. marginipenyiis Lee. An. Lye. 1, 173.) Head black in the female, yellow 

 in the male. Thorax very obsoletely punctulate, black; sides broadly rufous 

 in the male, rufous only at the anterior angles in the female ; base very much 

 rounded, somewhat angulated, not margined. Elytra very finely and obsoletely 

 punctulate, rufous with a large black spot near the apex and a little nearer to 

 the suture than the side. Beneath piceous j sides and feet yellow.

One male found at the mouth of the Gila, California. Oval, slightly oblong, 

 moderately convex. Head obsoletely punctured, base rounded, scarcely mar- 

 gined, black ; sides yellowish white ; apex with a transverse yellow spot, pos- 

 teriorly 3-dentate, at the sides almost reaching the yellow margin. Elytra dis-

One pair. San Francisco. Rounded oval, less convex than H. militaris. 

 Head scarcely punctulate, in the male yellow, in the female black. Thorax 

 scarcely punctulate, black, lateral margin yellow. Elytra very indistinctly 

 punctulate, yellow, M'ith a sutural vitta broader in front, and another very broad 

 vitta commencing at the base and extending to within one-seventh of the apex 

 deep black ; outer margin and apex with a very narrow black line. Beneath 

 blackish piceous, tarsi paler; anterior legs, tibiae and tarsi of the male tes- 

 taceous. 



In the female the black vittae are much broader, so that the elytra appear

 (Muls.) but the anterior spot does not reach the base, the posterior spot is vitti- 

 form, extending from the middle to within one seventh of the apex ; the outer 

 margin is much narrower and but slightly undulated, posteriorly it separates 

 from the margin, leaving the apex black. The feet are black, the anterior tibise 

 and extremity of the middle tibiae yellow.

 finely and densely punctured, and very finely pubescent. Head and organs of the 

 mouth yellow. Thorax narrowed in front, base slightly sinuous, finely margined, 

 black, sides with a yellow margin, which is wider in front. Elytra forming a 

 very distinct angle with the sides of the thorax, black, with a large transverse 

 spot, a posterior band and the apex yellow ; the spot is oblique and extends from 

 just below the humerus to the middle of the elytra, ending near the suture ; the 

 band is placed at the second third of the elytra, is sinuate on each side, and at the

 on the sides, as in S. flavifrons. The punctures of the elytra are somewhat 

 larger. In one specimen the head is testaceous, in the other it is black, but both 

 are females.

Say, Bost. Journ. Nat. Hist. 1, 203: Muls. 952. 



Pennsylvania, Georgia. Rounded, slightly oval, convex, black and shining, 

 covered with very fine gray hair. Head testaceous; thorax finely and closely 

 punctured, narrowed in front, but litte rounded on the sides, base rounded, finely 

 margined, scarcely at all sinuous, sides narrowly margined with testaceous. 

 Elytra more coarsely punctured, apex with a large yellow spot occupying about 

 one-fifth of the length, and having its anterior boundary slightly convex. Beneath 

 black, abdomen testaceous, black at base ; feet yellowish; the abdominal plates 

 extend to the posterior margin of the segment. 



Varies with the sides of the thorax widely testaceous, and the apex narrowly 

 margined with the same color. 



Allied to this species is S. x a n t h a s p i s Muls. 952, from Florida, which is

Div. 2. Corylophi, 



This division contains very small species, most of which are remarkable for 

 having the thorax produced in front above the head, as in Cassida, or Cossy- 

 phus. They differ in their habits from the genuine Coccinellae, most of them 

 being found in putrid vegetable matter. At times they are found flying about 

 at twilight in great numbers. 



Redtenbacher has founded upon these insects his family Clypeastres, con- 

 sidering the narrowness of the second tarsal joint and the hood-like form of the 

 thorax as sufficiently important to separate them. The mandibles are usually 

 crenate internally, but ace aiding to Erichson there is a gradual transition from 

 that form to the simple mandibles of many Coccinellae. The hood-like form of 

 the thorax can also be of but little importance, since in the genus Orthoperus, 

 which evidently belongs with Corylophus, this anterior prolongation is wanting. 

 We have thus left only two characters, the narrow tarsi, and the ciliated wings, 

 which however useful for systematic division, seem to be rather slight charac- 

 ters for the establishment of a natural family. In the genus Rypobius the tarsi 

 are also considerably dilatod. For these reasons I have followed Erichson in 

 uniting these genera with the Coccinellidae, establishing however a special 

 group under that family for their reception. Clambus must be absolutely 

 excluded from the Coccinellidae, since the peculiar laminated structure of its 

 posterior coxa is entirelv without analogy in this tribe, and is found only in the 

 singular genus Sphaerius, placed by Erichson among the Trichopterygia. 



I have but one new generus to add to this group. Those found in the United 

 States are thus related .

This genus agrees closely in characters with the next, but differs by ita 

 broad tarsi, which are similar to those of the genuine Coccinellidae. The thorax 

 is rounded in front, extending slightly over the head, but not concealing it. The 

 posterior angles are rectangular, not produced ; the elytra are subtruncate at 

 the apex. The body is elliptical, a little narrowed behind, moderately convex and 

 glabrous. The prosternum is very narrow and acute, the mesosternum extremely 

 small and rounded in front ; the tibiae are a little dilated towards the extremity.

I have a little hesitation in referring the species here described to Redten- 

 bacher's Microsphcera, as the mandibles are not entire, as described by him, but 

 armed with three very minute teeth. The palpi agree in form, but the third 

 joint of the tarsi is not cordiform, and indeed is scarcely visible. Redtenbacher's 

 insect is pubescent, while ours is glabrous, and this character is one of great 

 constancy in this family. The genus Orthoperus (Stephens) also agrees nearly 

 with our insect, but is described as having the club of the antennae two jointed ; 

 the inaccuracy of the English authors in the description of minute species is 

 however so well known, that no great stress should be laid upon that character, 

 especially as according to all analogy it must be impossible in this tribe for a 

 genus to have but two joints in the antennal club. Pithephilus (Heer) is con- 

 sidered by Erichson as identical with Microsphcera (Redt.), although it is 

 described as having pentamerous tarsi. This mistake might readily occur, as 

 the joints are very closely united. There can be no doubt about the proper 

 place of the genus in this tribe, as the wings are strongly ciliated just as in 

 Corylophus.

The English genus Sericoderus is described as having the antennal club three 

 jointed, but Corylophus too has the same structure, according to British autho- 

 rity. (Vide Westwood's Modern Classif. Insects.) Comparing other characters, 

 such as the form of the thorax and elytra, and above all the figure in Shuckard's 

 Illustrations of British Coleoptera, I find no reason why Redtenbacher's genus 

 should be retained ; however, we owe to him the first good description of the 

 genus. (Fauna Austr. 573.)

One specimen, New York. Smaller than the preceding and a little narrower. 

 The thorax is more broadly rounded in the middle, and the posterior angles are 

 more produced, forming with the middle of the base a distinct angle. The

This genus is precisely equivalent to Clypeaster, as limited by Redtenbacher, 

 (Faun. Austr. ^12.) The name Clypeaster can, however, never be retained for it, 

 as a genus of Echini has long before been know^n under the same name. I have 

 therefore felt myself compelled to propose a new name, which however I will 

 apply only to our native species, leaving to any European Entomologist, who 

 desires it, the task of transferring the species found in his country. I do this the 

 more willingly, as I have no desire to attach my name to species, which I would 

 not recognise if they were placed before me.

Description of a New Species o/ Trombiditjm. 

 By John L. Le Conte, M. D. 



T. magnificum, ovatum, postice angustatum et obtusum, densissime 

 miniato-velutinum, pedibus subaequalibus, rostro conico, apice obtuso. Long. 

 32, lat. -23. 



Texas, Dr. S. W. Woodhouse. This fine species is remarkable for its great 

 size, being equal toT. tinctorium. It belongs however to a different 

 division of the genus, the eyes being placed immediately above the first pair of 

 legs. The rostrum is conical, and obtuse at the apex. The palpi are conical, 

 more than three times as long as the rostrum, thick at the base ; the terminal 

 hook is longer than the penultimate joint, and is glabrous only at the apex ; the 

 inferior appendage is a little longer than the hook, and very pilose, it appears 

 rounded at the extremity. The feet are two-thirds the length of the body, the 

 first and fourth pairs a little longer than the intermediate ones. 



The body is soft, somewhat trapezoidal, narrowed and obtusely rounded 

 behind, less rounded in front, with the sides slightly sinuous in the middle. The 

 color is dark cinereous, above and beneath covered with very fine fur which is 

 of a bright vermillion color, becoming gray at the base of the legs. In the best 

 preserved specimens, the upper surface is irregularly impressed, resembling the 

 convolutions of the brain.

Mr. Cassin announced to the Society the return of Adolphus L. Heermann, 

 M. D., a member of this Society, after a residence of nearly three years in various 

 parts of California. Dr. H. visited that country for the express purpose of in- 

 vestigating its ornithology, and making collections in that, and in other depart- 

 ments of natural history, which he has done with great judgment and unrivalled 

 zeal, and has brought home the most extensive and valuable collection of birds 

 ever made in that country, with many other interesting objects. 



Dr. Genth made some remarks on two series of very interesting salts, dis- 

 covered by him about five years ago. They have conjugate bases, containing 

 cobalt and ammonia. The salts of one of the bases have red colors of different 

 shades between carmine and cherry-red ; those of the other base are orange- 

 colored. The red salts are very easily decomposed. The two bases and about 

 fifty different salts have been made, most of them in beautiful crystals. Dr. 

 Genth stated that (as his time is very limited) Dr. Wolcott Gibbs, of New 

 York, who has already prepared some of these salts, independently of his own 

 experiments, has promised him, at his request, to join his labor in completing 

 this investigation, after which both chemists intend to publish their results 

 under their joint names.

Mr. Ashmead called the attention of the members to the collection of marine 

 Algae presented by him this evening. He said it was remarked by Harvey in the 

 " Nereis Boreali-Americana," that after passing New York, the almost unbroken 

 line of sand is nearly destitute of Algse. " I have not," he adds, " received any 

 collection of sea plants made between Long Branch and Wilmington." 



However barren of Algae may be the shifting sands along the coast of New 

 Jersey, the floating spores have been carried into the inlets, and found a lodg-

ment in the shallow bays, on the steep banks of the deeper thoroughfares, and 

 in the second from the Great Egg Harber river to Cape Island. Algae occur in great 

 abundance, parasitical on the common eel grass (Zostera marina,) which is eo 

 extensively dispersed in the bays, and on the bars in the vicinity of Beesley's 

 Point, and which grows with such luxuriance as seriously to obstructthe passage 

 of boats when the tide is out. I found Algae growing on the oyster beds, on 

 sand bars, mud flats, also on shells, sods, and such submerged substances 

 as afforded a resting place. 



The submerged portions of the ship Rhine, which went ashore last winter at 

 Corson's Inlet, are already literally covered with marine vegetation. 



From the want of a standard collection in the Academy, I am unable at pre- 

 sent, with my limited knowledge of the science, to determine satisfactorily 

 many of the species. Among the specimens on the table will be found : 



Fucus vesiculosus, Linn. Very common.

California, from Dr. Heermann. Body above entirely of a light grey color, 

 produced by an intermixture of black and white points ; the hairs individually 

 are long and not fine ; they are gray at base, soon becoming black, and have a 

 pure white band about the middle ; intermixed with them are a few longer pure 

 black hairs. On the upper surface of the feet the hair is shorter, and the black 

 part comparatively smaller. A small spot towards the tip of the nose, and an 

 indistinct line above the eyes are black. The whiskers are shorter than the 

 head and entirely black. The ears are large, subtriangular, rounded at the tip, 

 and covered both within and without with short gray hair, which does not in 

 anyway form a fringe at the margin. Beneath the body is pure white, except 

 the perineum, which is gray. Tail long and distichous, with long hairs which 

 are black, with a gray base and white tip ; in those towards the edge the black 

 color is less developed, and some are even whitish with three black bands, of 

 which the outermost is very distinct. The tail thus appears gray, becoming 

 black externally, with a broad white margin ; beneath it is a little lighter in 

 color. 



This species is one of a multitude of interesting objects procured by Dr. A, 

 L. Heermann during a three years' residence in California. I beg him to accept 

 the dedication of it as a slight token of my appreciation of this active exertion 

 in studying the habits of animals, and collecting specimens in the less frequented 

 portions of our territory. 



At first sight S. Heermanni bears a strong resemblance to several gray 

 squirrels found in the Atlantic States, more especially to S. cinereus, but 

 the much larger size of the ears, the deeper gray color of the upper surface of 

 the feet, and the absence of any brown color about the head, at once distinguish 

 it from all its neighbors. 



Synopsis of the Scydm^nid^ of the United States. 



By John L. Le Conte, M. D. 



Since the publication of the extremely classical monograph of Scydmaenus by 

 Dr. Schaum,* and his corrections to the same,j the number of species found in 

 America has been greatly increased. A journey by Dr. Schaum to this country 

 has contributed largely to this result, and to him I am indebted for a fine series 

 of the species found by him, mostly in Louisiana. To M. Em. Wapler, late of 

 New Orleans, I must also express my acknowledgements for a beautiful series of 

 Scydmaeni, as well as other minute Coleoptera of Louisiana. The other species

described below have mostly been procured in my travels in the Southern States ; 

 a few are from California, but the distribution of this genus in the western and 

 northern parts of the continent appears to be very limited. The new Cephennium 

 is an interesting addition to our fauna. The new genus Brathinus must, I think, 

 be considered as the American representative of Mastigus of the old world. 

 Eutheia is not yet discovered on this continent, nor have we any form which 

 corresponds to it. Our three genera may be easily distinguished follows:

 still larger, subtransverse, 11th longer than the 10th and obtuse. Thorax very 

 transverse, sides parallel behind the middle, much rounded anteriorly, posterior 

 angles rectangular, a little flattened. Elytra scarcely narrower than the thorax, 

 convex, finely and sparsely punctulate, base impressed with a deep stria near the

 elevated, the suture is a little elevated at base, and marked with a fine impressed 

 line, which curves around the base reaching the humeral fovea, the elytra at the 

 middle are fully one-third wider than the thorax.

Georgia and Louisiana. Very similar to the preceding, but smaller. The 

 antennae are as long as the head and thorax, the joints 3 7 are rounded, not 

 longer than wide : the three next are larger and also rounded ; the last longer, 

 oval and subacute : on the elytra, the suture is a little elevated anteriorly and 

 marked with a slight stria ; the base is slightly bifoveate, and the humeri are 

 elevated.

Georgia. This species is smaller than S. basalis, and the antennas are shorter 

 and less slender. The unimpressed thorax, shorter pubescence and scarcely 

 foveate elytra will readily distinguish it from the other species in which the 

 thorax and elytra form a regular outline, without any re-entering angle. One 

 specimen has the Blh joint of the antennas intermediate in size between the 7th 

 and 9th, so that the club appears only three-jointed. I am unable to perceive 

 any other difference, and in the absence of other specimens, leave it under the 

 present species.

Louisiana, Schaum and Wapler. This species is very similar to the preceding, 

 but is narrower, being of the form of S. basalis, with which it agrees also in the 

 antenna?, but differs in size, and in having no impression at the base of the thorax. 

 The feet are testaceous, the thighs are darker : the tip of the abdomen beneath is

 New York and Pennsylvania, in the nests of a small black ant. This species 

 is more obtusely rounded behind than the preceding species of this division. The 

 pubescence is more prostrate, and very dense. The antennae are not longer than 

 the head and thorax : the four last joints form a club larger in proportion than in 

 the other species, and as long as the other joints collectively. The thorax is 

 less narrowed in front than in the preceding species, and is a little rounded on 

 the sides : there is no impression at the base : the elytra are slightly foveate 

 inside of the humerus.

Pennsylvania, Haldeman; found with a small fuscous ant. This species is of 

 a bright testaceous color, and entirely glabrous. The head is convex and rounded. 

 The antennae are longer than the head and thorax, the joints 3 7 are cylindrical, 

 the four last are globular and about twice as thick as those which precede them. 

 The thorax is a little wider than the head, longer than wide, slightly narrowed 

 in front, very slightly rounded on the sides, flattened on the disc, and deeply 

 foveate near the basal angles : the foveas are connected by a transverse impres- 

 sion. The elytra are twice as wide as the thorax, regularly oval and convex, 

 forming a slight angle with the thorax; the base is broadly foveate inside of the 

 humerus. The anterior thighs are strongly clavate.

Lake Superior, Georgia, Louisiana. A darker variety is S. pilosicollis of my 

 catalogue of Lake Superior Coleoptera in Agassiz' Lake Superior. The head is 

 smaller in this than in the preceding species, oval, and glabrous; the elongate

An Attempt at a Synopsis of the Genus Geomys Raf. 

 By John L. Le Contb, M. D. 



Having discovered in the museum of the Academy two nondescript species 

 belonging to this curious genus of pouched rats, I thought that it might be use- 

 ful, in making them known, to attempt also to bring together in a concise man- 

 ner the characteristics of the species heretofore described. 



The collection of the Academy is fortunately so rich in this genus that I have 

 had an opportunity of inspecting more species than any author since Richardson 

 first made known his numerous species. 



I would further observe, that on account of the great rarity of specimens in the 

 museums of continental Europe, the attempts in systematic works to reduce this 

 genus to order have been by no means successful. 



Rightly has Richardson preferred the older name of Rafinesque to the more re- 

 cent ones of Kuhl, Lichtenstein and Say; Pseudostoma, the name proposed by the 

 latter, and unfortunately employed in the superb workof Audubon and Bachman 

 on North American mammalia, can in no case be adopted, because, as will be 

 seen below, even if the early name of Rafinesque should be dismissed on account 

 of any mental obliquity displayed in other matters, the name Saccophorus, pro- 

 posed by Kuhl, has fully three years priority. For the same reason Ascomys, 

 proposed by Lichtenstein, and adopted by Wagner in his supplement to Schreber, 

 must also be rejected, although it antedates Say's name by one year. 



There is among many scientific men a tendency to disregard every thing written 

 by Rafinesque, on the plea that many of his names are hastily proposed, and 

 founded upon false or imaginary characters. But surely his scientific zeal and 

 laborious research deserve more attention, where their results are not obscured 

 by his mental peculiarities. This view has induced me to coincide with Rich- 

 ardson in restoring to this group the generic name of Geomys. 



Some persons disposed to be hypercritical might object, that as Rafinesque in 

 reality established two genera, Geomys and Diplostoma, both referring to the 

 same things, it is a matter of doubt which name should be adopted, and would 

 therefore reject both. A simple reference to the original text will at once re- 

 move this objection. The imperfection of the specimens will account for the 

 " no tail " of Diplostoma, but no stretch of imagination can excuse the " four 

 toes to all the feet," and " two long jutting and furrowed front teeth above and 

 beneath." 



The characters of Geomys, on the contrary, are correct in every particular, 

 and quite sufficient to separate the genus from all others known. 



Misled by accounts of travellers, Richardson at first divided this group into 

 those with external and those with internal cheek-pouches, reserving to the for- 

 mer the untenable name of Diplostoma. In his recent writings he has reviewed 

 his former opinion, and now considers them as forming but one genus. 




158 [September, 



^ Much of the confasion in the species has arisen from a laudable desire to iden- 

 tify and retain the names of the older authors, even when unsupported by suffi- 

 cient descriptions. Science has now, however, advanced so far, that it is time to 

 get rid of all hypothetical synonyms by excluding definitely all that is too im- 

 perfect for use, even when sanctioned by great age or character. I have accord- 

 ingly placed at the end of this paper, references to all such descriptions as seem 

 to be unfit for quotations under any individual species, and would recommend 

 that these having now been collected together, should be hereafter passed over 

 in respectful silence. 



The synonyms of this genus are as follows :Geomys Raf. (1817): 

 [DiPLoSTOMA Raf. (1817); Sacchophorus Kuhl^ (1820); Ascomys Lichtenstein, 

 (1822); PsEUDOSTOMA Say^ (1823); Oryctomys, Eydoux, (1827); Thomomys 

 Wied. (1839). 



The two last names belong only to the second division of the genus, or those 

 with smooth incisors, that character having been assumed as of generic value. 



The following analytical table expresses the relation between all the species 

 which I have had an opportunity of examining. Four species of Richardson be- 

 longing to group B. and G. castanops, the place of which is uncertain, have not 

 been included, as I have not seen them, and can only take what has been writ- 

 tea by others upon them.

One specimen, Mexico, Mr. Pease's collection. This species differs from all 

 the others in having the fur very coarse and harsh, and entirely of a reddish 

 brown color. Beneath it is slightly grayish, but the difference in color is by no 

 means obvious. The ears are not at all prominent, being merely openings in the 

 skin. The whiskers are as long as the head. The upper incisors are broken off, 

 but enough remains to show that they were deeply grooved near the middle of 

 the anterior surface ; it is impossible to determine if there is a second submar- 

 ginal groove. The tail is completely naked except at the root. The feet are 

 precisely as in the other species of this division of the genus.

One small specimen from the Bonaparte collection, locality not stated. Ac- 

 cording to Lichtenstein and Bachman it is found in Canada and in the upper and. 

 middle portion of the valley of the Mississippi. 



The fur is fine and dense, not very lustrous ; it is deep plumbeous for two- 

 thirds of its length ; above it is tipped with rufous, beneath with ochreous yel- 

 low ; the margin of the cheek pouches, the feet, and the posterior part of the fore 

 legs are covered with whitish hair. The margin of the ears is short but very 

 distinct ; the tail is almost entirely naked. The superior incisors have two 

 grooves, the outer one broad and deep, nearer the external than the internal mar- 

 gin ; the inner one fine and deep, contiguous to the margin. The anterior claws 

 are comparatively larger than in G. hispidus. 



This species agrees accurately with the description and figure of Lichtenstein. 

 Mus bursarius (Shaw,) which is referred to this species, is altogether doubtful, 

 and ought to be omitted ; his description reads " cauda subnuda," while the figure 

 represents it as decidedly hairy for its whole length ; the references to it as well 

 as to other notices too imperfect for determination will be found at the end ot 

 this essay. Godman's figure is worthless, and both his account and Harlan's are 

 copied from Say. Mitchell's account is extremely imperfect, and nothing bur 

 the locality (Lake Superior) induces me to refer it to this species. Wagner has 

 misquoted Lichtenstein ; the citations from Brantz and Kuhl I have copied, as I 

 have not had access to their original memoirs. Eydoux' remarks relate only to 

 the teeth, and are applicable to other species.

Pseudostoma floridana Aud. and Bachm. Quadrup. Am. 3 pi. 150, fig. 1. 

 One specimen from Florida in the Academy, and two from Alabama, from V. 

 G. Audubon, Esq. ; also inhabits the lower part of Georgia, but suddenly dis- 

 appears at the Savannah river, not extending into South Carolina. The far is 

 fine, dense and shining, dark plumbeous, on the back tipped with blackish brown, 

 fading gradually on the sides into brown, and on the belly into whitish gray ; 

 the upper lip is white; the ears are scarcely perceptibly elevated ; the tail is 

 naked, with only a few distant, short, grayish hairs. The upper incisors are 

 deeply grooved just outside of the middle of the anterior face : the inner margin 

 is not grooved. The smaller of the specimens sent me by the kindness of Mr. 

 Audubon is more decidedly brown, so that the dark color is assumed only by 

 the adult animal, or is dependent on season. 



Rafinesque's description "murine color, tail entirely naked, shorter than the 

 body," although short, is characteristicj and coupled with the locality, leaves no 

 doubt whatever of the identify of the present species. There is a notice m 

 Bewick's History of Quadrupeds, (New York ed., 1804, p. 525,) of a species from 

 Georgia, by Dr. S. L. Mitchill, which from the locality may be identical with 

 the one here described, but the description is worthless, and is moreover unac- 

 companied by any systematic name.

Saccojjhorus mexicanus Fischer, Richardson, Rep. Brit. Ass. 6, 156; Syn. Mam. 

 305 : Eydoux, Voy. Favorite, 23, tab. 8. 



One specimen, Mexico, Mr. J. Speakman. Fur very fine, shining, very dark 

 cinereous, above tipped with black, beneath entirely cinereous ; nose and whis- 

 kers brownish ; breast and fore legs slightly tinted with brown. Ears short. 

 Tipper incisors with a very deep groove on the middle of the anterior surface. 

 Feet thinly clothed with brownish hair. Tail covered with hair, which is very 

 dense and long at the base, gradually becoming shorter and more scanty, leav- 

 ing the tip almost naked. 



This specimen agrees with Lichtenstein's and Wagner's descriptions, except 

 that the tail is not " very thinly haired ; " a lighter colored specimen mentioned 

 in a marginal note by Wagner, had the " root of the tail surrounded by a very 

 short band of hair ; the remaining part naked, with verticillate scales." So that 

 this species must vary considerably in the structure of the tail, or there are 

 several closely allied species confounded under the same name. The extraordi- 

 nary variations mentioned by Brantz, but not seen by any other author, would 

 seem to give weight to the latter opinion ; the varieties are thus described : 



"/?. Castaneus, infra canescens, maculis gastrsei daabus nigro-fuscis. 



"}/. Saturate nigro-fuscus, maculis gastreei duabus irregularibus albis, canal- 

 iculo dent. prim. sup. magis laterali et externo." 



I have omitted the citations from Hernandez and other old and unsystematic 

 authors, because I see no utility in repeating continually barbarous names, which 

 were in use before natural history assumed the form of a science.

Two specimens marked " Pseudostoma bursarius, Columbia river, J. K. 

 Townsend." Another from Mr. Audubon without locality, under the same 

 name. Fur fine, shining, very dark cinereous, tipped with chestnut brown, 

 becoming paler beneath ; hair on the middle of the back tipped with fuscous ; 

 whiskers shorter than the head, whitish ; chin with a large spot of whitish hair ; 

 feet densely clothed with white hair. Ears with a very short elevated margin. 

 Upper incisors with a very deep groove at the middle, and a narrow but distinct 

 one at the inner margin of the anterior face. Tail short, covered with whitish 

 hair, becoming scanty at the tip. Claws of the posterior feet rather obtuse, and 

 moderately flattened. 



The hairy tail and white chin at once distinguish this species from G. cana- 

 densis. The color is much less red, and the middle of the back darker. It agrees 

 very closely with the figure and description of Diplostoma? bulbivorum, Rich- 

 ardson, Fauna Bor. Am. 206, pi. 18B, (the latter marked by mistake D. Dougla- 

 sii,) but that species has no grooves on the upper incisors.

" Geomys bursarius Richardson." Gray, ibid. 



Two specimens from Columbia river, J. K. Townsend; the larger one labelled 

 "Pseudostoma Townsendi (Rich.)," the smaller one "Pseudostoma borealis." 



The fur is very fine and shining, dark cinereous, tipped on the back with ru- 

 fous, on the sides and beneath with white; on the chin and feet the hair is almost 

 entirely white. The whiskers are gray, and nearly as long as the head. The 

 ears are short but distinct. The tail is covered with whitish hair ; the upper in- 

 cisors are slender, and marked with a very fine line at the inner margin of the 

 anterior face. 



This species (and probably all the others of this division,) has the inferior 

 incisors much more slender than those above described ; the fossorial claws of the 

 anterior feet are also much smaller, so that even if the teeth were wanting no 

 difficulty would ensue in the determination of the species. 



The specimen of the Prince de Weid was found on the plains of the Missouri, 

 but his description agrees so accurately with our specimens, that there can be no 

 doubt of their identity. Dr. Bachman mentions his want of faith in the specific 

 difference of the two specimens described by him, and gives them as distinct on 

 the authority of Richardson. The latter remarks in Beechey's Voyage, that 'G. 

 Townsendi is distinguished from G. borealis by its longer tail." It must be ob- 

 served, however, that in Dr. Bachman's measurements, the small specimen of G. 

 borealis, five inches and a half in length, has the same length of tail as the large 

 one, which is two inches longer. The specimen of G. Townsendi of the same 

 size as the large G. borealis, had a tail nine lines longer, which is in exact pro- 

 portion to the small specimen of G. borealis. The large specimen now before 

 me, (which is labelled G. Townsendi,) has the precise proportions of the G. 

 borealis described by Bachman, and is probably the identical one examined bj 

 him. On careful examination, I find that the tail does not taper regularly as in 

 the other specimen, and, moreover, at its apex a distinct cicatrix is visible. I 

 think we are therefore warranted in concluding that Geomys borealis is founded 

 in a mistake. 



I do not know what Mr. J. E. Gray means by quoting " Geomys bursarius 

 Richardson, Report of British Association, 1836, 156," as a synonym of this 

 species. Sir John Richardson, on page 9 of the Zoology of Beechey's Voyage, 

 mentions that Mus bursarius of Shaw is a Geomys, and on page 12 describes G. 

 borealis, thereby implying that he considers them as distinct species. 



There is a third specimen in the museum of the Academy labelled " Pseudos- 

 toma Richardsonii, Columbia river, J. K. Townsend," which only differs from 




162 [September, 



those above described in being darker colored, and brown above, rather than 

 rufous ; the head is darker, the breast is slightly tinged with brown, the chin and 

 inside of the cheek pouches more distinctly white, and the sides of the mouth 

 dark fuscous. As, however, I can find no specific characters of importance, I 

 am obliged to consider it as a variety. Its dimensions are as follows :

Found near Bent's Fort. Dr. Baird does not mention whether the tail is naked 

 or hairy; the incisors are not described, probably because they were wanting, 

 and we have therefore no data to determine the position of this species. Judging 

 by the length of the exposed part of the anterior middle claw, it should belong to 

 the first division. 



A species with bisulcate superior iacisors is mentioned by Richardson (Report 

 British Ass. 5, 157,) under the name Geomys Drummondi, and by Wagner as 

 Ascomys Drummondi, but as no description has yet been published, the species 

 must of course be dropped from the books.

A very singular species from San Diego, California. The head is twice as 

 long as wide, the antennae are inserted in from of the eyes, but not at the tip ; 

 they are strongly serrate in the male, and but moderately so in the female, the 

 last joint of the maxillary palpi is longer than the preceding, and acute. The 

 thorax is not wider than long. The elytra are dilated behind, and the tip is 

 entire in both sexes. The basal joints of the abdomen are membraneus in the 

 middle of their ventral surface. The anterior tarsi of the male have the two 

 basal joints slightly dilated. In this species the clypeus has a small mem-

 who rejoice in a limited amount of classic lore. The name given by Dejean

 Pennsylvania. This species is unknown to me. It is described as being 



black, with the feet antepectus, head and thorax rufous, the latter with a 

 dusky vitta. It may be an Anthocomus, but from its small size, the reference 

 to this genus is probably correct. 



AcLETUS Lee.

I have only males of this genus, which differ from Ebaeus by the first joint 

 of the anterior tarsi being inferior, and almost indistinct; the tip of the elytra 

 is not impressed ; the ventral segments of the abdomen are entirely corneous. 

 The itisect has somewhat the appearance of Malihinus, but with longer elytra.

Two male from Eagle Harbor, Lake Superior. The posterior tibiae are slight- 

 ly bent inwards, and the joints of the antennae after the 4th, are triangular, 

 with the internal angle much prolonged, so that the organs become tolerably 

 strongly pectinate.

The body is elongate and linear, the head as broad as the thorax, very much 

 narrowed in front of the eyes, which are prominent ; the tip of the elytra is 

 eimple in both sexes ; the head of the male is slightly trifoveate ; the ventral 

 segments of the abdomen are entirely corneous.

San Diego, California ; the palpi and antennae are black, the under part of 

 the three basal joints of the latter pale. The pale margin of the thorax is inter- 

 rupted at the apex in a specimen from San Francisco, which also has the thorax 

 a little narrowed behind, and the posterior angles less rounded than in the San 

 Diego specimens. It may perhaps be a different species, but a greater number 

 of specimens will be wanted to determine the question. 



Atelestds Er. 



1. A. basalis, opacus, sanguineus, brevissime pubescens, capite fusco, 

 thorace latitudine longiore, postice angustato basi producto et emarginato, 

 elytris depressis, thorace loagioribus, atris basi sanguineo-marginatis. 

 Long. 12. 



San Diego, California, under sea weeds. The red of the base of the elytra 

 extends on the outer margin almost to the middle. The male of this species, 

 as well as of both the following, has the 2d joint of the anterior tarsi obliquely 

 produced above (as in our species of Anthocomus) as far as the end of the 3rd 

 joint, which is aUo elongated. In this character it differs remarkably from 

 Erichson's Atelestus hemipterus, the male of which has the first joint of the 

 anterior tarsi produced obliquely under the second. According to Erichson's 

 principles of division, our species should form a separate genus, but as I have 

 been able, by this description, to find no difference except this sexual one, I do 

 not feel justified in giving a new generic name to the species here described. 



2. A. abdominalis, sanguineus, opacus, brevissime pubescens, thorace 

 latitudine longiore, postice angustato, basi producto vix emarginato, elytris

San Diego, with the preceding; the scutellum is red, but the elytra are 

 immaculate.

San Francisco ? One male sent by Mr. Pease. In the two preceding species 

 the elytra are gradually widened from the base, and lie together at the suture 

 for the greater part of their length. In this species they are not widened on 

 the sides, and commence to separate immediately behind the scutellum, which 

 is black. 



Div. 2. Dasytini. 



Dasytes Fabr. 



Although differing much in the form of the body, there appears to be no natu- 

 ral mode of separating the following species into genera; the two last species, 

 which are the only oues from the eastern part of the continent, do recede 

 remarkably from the others in the absence of the appendages between the claws 

 of the tarsi. There are however European species similar to them, which are 

 retained by Redtenbacher, in the genus Dasytes. We have not in North Ame- 

 rica the intermediate forms having one claw simple and the other with an

 species, which in the western part of the continent will become quite numerous 

 and very difficult.

By Spencer F. Baird and Charles Gibard. 



Third part. Containing the Batrachians in the collection made by J. H. 

 Clark, Esq., under Col. J. D. Graham, on the United States and Mexican 

 Boundary. 



Amblystoma PROSERPINE, B. and G. Head oval, longer than broad. Limbs 

 and toes well developed. Posterior legs a little shorter than the anterior ones. , 

 Tail somewhat compressed, tapering; shorter than the body and head together. 

 Five inches in length from the end of the mouth to the tip of the tail : head one- 

 eighth of this length. Body nearly cylindrical, more so in the male than in the 

 female. 



This species is related to A. mavortium, which it resembles in coloring, but 

 it differs from the latter in having a proportionally longer head, and longer limbs 

 and toes. The tail, however, is shorter. 



Six immature specimens were obtained at Salado, four miles from San Antonio, 

 Texas. Specimens nearly full grown were collected by R. H. Kern, Esq., of 

 Philadelphia, on the route from Montgomery, Mexico. 



Rana areolata, B. and G. Head very large, sub-elliptical ; snout prominent, 

 nostrils situated half way between its tips and the anterior rim of the eyes, which 

 are proportionally large. The tympanum is spherical, and of medium size ; its 

 central portion is yellowish-white, whilst its periphery is black. The body is 

 raiher short and stout ; the limbs well developed ; the fingers and toes very 

 long without being slender. The ground color of the body and head is yellowish- 

 green, marked with dark brown. Besides there are from thirty to fifty brown 

 areolae, margined with a yellowish line. The upper part of the limbs is of the 

 same color as the body, but instead of areolae, transverse bands of brown are 

 seen on the hind ones. The lower part of ihe head and body is yellowish, with 

 small dusky spots along the margin of the lower jaw, and under the neck. 



A specimen three inches and a half long was found at Indianola, and a small 

 one on the Rio San Pedro of the Gila. 



BuFo PDNCTATUS, B. and G. Head short, sub-triangular ; upper surface even. 

 Two inches in total length. Body and upper portion of the limbs covered with 

 minute red tubercles. Color of a uniform yellowish-green or yellowish-brown, 

 punctured with red on the head, on the upper part of the body and limb?. Be- 

 neath yellowish, with occasional minute dots under the head and on the breast. 

 Caught on the Rio San Pedro of the Rio Grande Del Norte. 



BuFO GRANULOSUS, B. and G. This species is closely related to the preceding, 

 from which it can be distinguished by a larger and more triangular head, whose 

 upper surface presents a widely open groove, extending from the occiput to the 

 snout, where it terminates in a very narrow channel. The upper periphery of 

 the orbits is thus surrounded with a carina which extends from the eyes to the 

 nostrils below. The body is covered with very conspicuous tubercles. The 

 limbs are rather slender. The ground color is brown, maculated or marbled 

 above with black patches and dots. Unicolor beneath. 



One specimen was collected on the route between Indianola and San Antonio, 

 Texas. 




174 [October, 



Descriptions of new species of Reptiles^ collected ly the U. S. Exploring Expedi- 

 tion under the command o/Capt. Charles Wilkks, U. S. N. 



First part. Including the species from the Western coast of America. 

 Bj Spencer F. Baibd and Charles Girard. 



Amblystoma tenebrosum, B. and G. The single specimen of this species 

 brought home by the Expedition is five inches and a half in length, of which 

 the tapering and most compressed tail occupies two and a quarter. The head 

 is subelliptical, and longer than broad. The limbs are proportionally stout ; the 

 third finger is the longest. The color (as preserved in alcohol) is uniformly 

 cheanut brown, marbled with a much deeper (nearly black) brown. 



This species is related to A. macro dactylum^ Baird, but differs from it in the 

 Structure of the hind feet, in which the fourth finger is the longest; also in the 

 vomerine band of teeth, which, in A. macrodactylum forms a curve convex for- 

 w^irds, on the middle region of the palate, while in A. tenebrosum, the convexity 

 of the same curve is directed backwards. 



From Oregon. 



Rax\a aurora, B. and G. The general aspect of this species differs greatly 

 from that of all its congeners in North America. The length of the body and 

 head together is three inches and a half, the head forming nearly one third of 

 this length. The head itself is pyramidal, pointed, the nostrils situated midway 

 between the anterior rim of the eye and the tip of the snout. Eyes of medium 

 eiz?, anterior limbs short; fingers rather long and slender. The body is orange 

 red, with here and there black irregular patches. 



From Puget Sound. 



Rana Draytonii, B. and G. This species resembles very much the preceding 

 in its external appearance. It differs, however, in having a truncated snout, the 

 no3tril3 consequently nearer to its tip than to the eyes. The eyes themselves 

 and tympanum are proportionally larger than in R. auroray the limbs more de- 

 veloped and the tongue much narrower. The ground color is olivaceous green, 

 maculated with black on the upper region of the body and limbs, whilst under- 

 neath the hue is unicolor, except sometimes under the head, breast and hind 

 legs, where the brown and white mingle in circular dots. 



Specimens were collected at San Francisco, California, and on Columbia River 

 by Mr. Drayton himself, to whom we take pleasure in dedicating this species. 



Hyla regilla, B. and G. This is a species of medium size; the largest indi- 

 vidual observed measuring one inch and a half from the nose to the posterior 

 exireraity of the body, the head itself occupying about half of this length. The 

 bind legs are long and slender, the web extending only to half the length of the 

 longest toe; fingers comparatively long. The general color is green above, 

 turning to orange yellow along the sides of the bead, abdomen and legs. Two 

 oblong, brownish black spots exist on the occiput, from which two vittse (one 

 pair) of the same black color extend along the dorsal region; a similar band 

 passes from the tip of the nose, across the eye and tympanum, and along the 

 abdomen, when it is interrupted and forms a series of black and irregular small 

 spots. In the immature state, green is the prevailing color; a few black spots 

 being present along the whitish abdomen. 



Specimens of this species were collected on Sacramento River, in Oregon and 

 Puget Sound. Drawings from life were made on the spot by Mr. Drayton. 



Bufo BOREAS, B. and G. Upper surface of head flat, nearly even, the orbits 

 alone being raised above it. Snout truncated. Parotids of medium size and 

 oblong. Tympanum comparatively small. Body tuberculous or warty. Ilind 

 feet webbed to nearly the tip of the toes. The color is brownish green abovr, 

 dirty white below, with blackish brown patches spread all over. There is a 

 dorsal, narrow and yellowish stripe, extending posteriorly from behind the eyes 

 along the whole length of the body. 




1852.] 175 



Specimens were obtained on Columbia River and Puget Sound. The body of 

 the largest one measures a little over four inches. 



ScELOPORUs GRACILIS, B. and G. A pretty little species, calling to mind Sc. 

 graciosus described and figured in Stausbury's Report on the great Salt Lake of 

 Utab. It is slenderer, however, and possesses more elongated limbs and tail. 

 The fingers and toes are likewise very slender. The head is gently conical in 

 front; the plates which cover its upper surface resemble somewhat those in Sc. 

 graciosus, although presenting good specific differences as will be shown by the 

 figures. The scales are proportionally small and slightly carinated ; larger on 

 the tail. There are from twelve to fourteen distinct femoral pores right and 

 left. 



Above, the color is brown with a lateral and narrow yellowish stripe extend- 

 ing on either side from the eye to the tail, and margined by a series of elongated 

 black dashes. On the sides of the body there is a double series of black cres- 

 cents, convex backwards. The inferior part of the body is light and unicolor in 

 the female, whilst the male is provided on the sides of the abdomen with a deep 

 blue elongated area. 



Inhabits Oregon. 



ScELOPORUS occiDENTALis, B. and G. This species has the general appearance 

 and shape of -S'c. undulatus, from which we distinguish it by marked differences 

 in the cephalic plates. The dorsal scales are more strongly carinated and their 

 posterior point more acute, thus giving to the animal a rougher aspect. The 

 posterior margin of the scales on the lower surface of the head and sides is on 

 the other hand much less indented, especially in advance of the hind legs. 



Inhabits California, and probably Oregon, although less numerous in the 

 latter country where it is replaced by Sc. gracilis and the following species. 



ScBLOPORUS FRONTALIS, B. and G. The most striking character of this species 

 consists in the rounded shape of the snout, a feature attracting immediate notice. 



The occipital, vertical and frontal plates resemble more those in Sc. undulatus, 

 than in Sc. occidentaHs, but the arrangement of the supraciliaries is more like 

 that in Sc. occideiitalis than in Sc. undulatus. The scales are slightly carinated ; 

 heuce a general smooth appearance which contrasts somewhat strikingly with 

 that 0^ Sc. occidentalis. The dorsal scales are nearly of the same size as in Sc. 

 occidentalism but at the origin of the tail are sensibly larger. The tail of the 

 unique specimen before us, is broken off at about an inch from the vent. 



Caught in going up Puget Sound. 



Elgaria prin'cipis, B. and G. Twelve longitudinal rows of smooth abdominal 

 scales, trapezoidal on the belly. Fourteen similar rows of carinated scales on 

 the upper part of the body, forming forty-five transversal series from immedi- 

 ately behind the meatus to the origin of the tail. On the tail itself the scales are 

 the largest, smooth underneath and slightly carinated above. The body and 

 limbs are of slender appearance. The species appears not to attain a very large 

 size ; the largest individual seen measures about nine inches from the nose to 

 the tip of the tail. 



Of the cephalic plates the vertical one is the most prominent; the shape of 

 the frontal plates readily distinguishes this species from E. scincicauda. 



Color uniform olivaceous brown above and below ; three series (either double 

 or single) of black spots all along the upper region from the head to the tail. 



From Oregon and Puget Sound. 



Edgaria FORMOSA, B. and G. Sixteen longitudinal rows of strongly carinated 

 scales on the upper part of the body, forming about fifty transversal series from 

 the meatus to the origin of the tail. Abdominal scales twelve rowed. Tail 

 very long, conical, and tapering. Color yellowish green, with numerous irregu- 

 lar, narrow, transverse bands of brownish black tipped posteriorly with white. 



This species resembles Gerrhonotu^ muliicarinatus of Blainville, {Elgaria 

 multicarinata) in the slender appearance of its body and limbs; the latter how- 




176 [October, 



ever assume still more this character in E. muliicarinata, the scales of which 

 are considerably larger than the species here described. 

 From California. 



Elgaria grandis, B. and G. Fourteen longitudinal rows of carinated scales 

 on the upper part of the body; the carina on the sides is but slightly apparent. 

 Fifty transversal series from the meatus to tqe origin of the tail. Tail itself 

 one and a half times as large as the body, conidal and tapering. Twelve rows 

 of abdominal scales, subquandrangular in shape. Color olivaceous brown, with 

 irregular, transverse and narrow bands of brownish black tipped posteriorly 

 with white. 



This species is intimately related to the preceding, from which it differs in the 

 structure of the fronto-nasal plates and the shape of the scales generally. The 

 limbs are also shorter. 



Inhabits Oregon. 



Tropidonotus ordinoides, B. and G. Is distinguished from T. inprnaliSf 

 {^Coluber infernalis, Bl.), to which it bears the closest resemblance, by a 

 smaller and more slender head and likewise a smaller eye. There are two an- 

 terior orbitals, whilst T. infernalis has but one. The scales constituting the 

 lateral row on either side of the abdomen are larger and not keeled. The scales 

 on the upper part of the tail are likewise smooth. The general color is yellow- 

 ish green with a dorsal yellow line ; sometimes also there exists a lateral band 

 of yellowish or whitish yellow, between which and the dorsal line, are two lon- 

 gitudinal rows of polymorphic black spots recalling to mind T. ordinatus. 



From Puget Sound. 



WENONA (Nov. gen.) Head conical, rather small and continuous with the 

 body. Vertical plate about as broad as it is long; between it and the rostral 

 plate are two or three pairs of frontals. Occipitals and supraorbitals rather 

 small and nearly of equal size. Eyes very small, no loral plaie ; one anterior 

 orbital, large ; the post orbitals are not to be distinguished from the temporal 

 scales. Body cylindrical, covered with small lozenge-shaped and smooth scales. 

 Abdominal shields narrow, one rowed under the tail behind the vent, as well as 

 on the abdomen. Tail very short, slightly tapering towards the tip. 



This genus is related to Tortrix, and will probably include the T. Boitce of 

 Blainville. 



Wenona ISABELLA, B. and G. Vertical plates broader than long. Two pairs 

 of frontal ones. A small plate between the post-frontal pair and the vertical. 

 Length about sixteen inches, of which about two belong to the 'tail. Of a uni- 

 form deep Isabel color, lighter on the belly. 



From Fuget Sound. 



Wenona plumbea, B. and G. Vertical plate broader than long. Three pairs 

 of frontal plates; the anterior pair extending on the side of the snout in advance 

 of the nostrils as in the preceding species. The second pair extends likewise 

 down and occupies the place of the loral, which may sometimes appear as an 

 independent plate. Lower jaw much shorter than the upper one. A double 

 row of plates along the upper jaw ; length about eighteen inches. The tail two 

 and a half inches and slightly tapering. Shield under the tail narrower and 

 more elongated than in the preceding species. Of a uniform bluish lead color 

 above, whitish beneath. 



From Puget Sound. 



Calamaria tenuis, B. and G. General form slender; about eight inches in 

 length from the tip of the snout to the end of the tail. Head somewhat detached 

 from the body. Tail short and conical, one inch and a quarter in length. Occi- 

 pital plates elongated, elliptical in form ; vertical one subpentagonal. Two pairs 

 of frontals, an odd and elliptical small plate in advance of the vertical, between 

 the posterior frontals. Eyes proportionally large. Scales smooth and subellip- 

 tical in form. Color of a uniform brown, lighter beneath. 



From Puget Sound. 




1852.] 177 



Crotalus LUCIFER, B. and G. Head subcircular or elliptical, nearly one inch 

 and a quarter in length, covered on the vertex with very small and polygonal 

 scales, elliptical and slightly carinated on the occipital region. One large supra 

 orbital scutella obliquely striated. Eyes proportionally small, ten large anterior 

 orbital plates ; the upper one, which is the longest, is polygonal, whilst the lower 

 one is triangular. The rostral plate is rather small, pointed above, higher than 

 broad and pentagonal in form. The general color is reddish brown above, 

 deeper along the dorsal line than on the sides, yellowish beneath. For two- 

 thirds of the length there exists on the back a series of subcircular white rings 

 lined internally with a narrow, black line. There are on the sides a series of 

 irregular blotches which extend to the belly. The posterior third of the body 

 is alternately semi-annulated above with black and yellow, the yellow, however, 

 being much narrower than the black. 



From Oregon and California. 



Emys marmorata, B. and G. The shape of the shell seen from above is regu- 

 larly elliptical, slightly concave anteriorly, with a small notch behind. It is 

 rather depressed and provided with a slight dorsal keel. Ventral shield rounded 

 in front, openly concave behind. The tail is very slender and tapering. The 

 posterior nails are stouter than the anterior ones and very much arched. The 

 color is yellowish brown marbled with black. 



The largest specimen under examination measures four inches in length from 

 the tip of the snout to the end of the tail ; the shell itself being only two inches 

 and three-eighths in length and a little over two inches in width.

Descnpttdns of neio Species of Reptiles inhabiting North America. 



By Edward Hallowell, M. D. 

 Tropidonotus rhombifer. 



Sp. Char. Head elongated, depressed, slightly swollen at the temples ; a 

 series of dark colored rhomboid spots upon the back, presenting the form of 

 triangles, their apices posteriorly and anteriorly touching each other; a row of 

 dark colored transverse bars upon the sides, uniting with the lateral inferior 

 extremities of the rhomboid spots upon the back ; a series of dark colored bands 

 upon the tail ; abdomen wnd under part of tail more or less maculated ; scuta 

 very strongly carinated: 25 rows of carinated scales; abdominal scuta 142; 

 sub-caudal 70. 



Dimensions. Length of head l^^ inches (Fr.) ; greatest breadth posteriorly 

 10 lines; length of body 2 ft. ; of tail 6^ inches ; total length 2 ft. 8 inches. 



Habitat. Arkansas river and its tributaries, near the northern boundary of 

 the Creek Nation ; found abundantly on the borders of streams. Dr. Wood- 

 house observed one with many young on one of the sand banks of the Arkansas 

 river. 



Tropidonotus transversus. 



Sp. Char. Head large, swollen at the temples, convex posteriorly, flattened 

 between the orbits, depressed in front ; a series of subquadrate dark colored 

 blotches, thirty-six or thirty-seven in number, along the back ; a transverse 

 row of oblong bars along the sides, their upper margins alternating with the 

 inferior margins of the dorsal blotches; scales strongly carinated, 23 rows; 

 abdominal scuta 144; sub-caudal 78. 



Dimensions. Length of head 12 lines; greatest breadth 7; length of body 

 1 ft. (Fr.) 5 inches 7 lines ; length of tail 6 inches; total length 2 ft.

 butaries. 




178 [October, 



Remarks. In Tropidinotas taxis pilotus the bars upon the back are much wider 

 apart than in the above species, and it has but two posterior ocular plates ; the 

 arrangement of the temporal plates is also different ; the frontal plate is much 

 larger, and it has thirty-one rows of scales. Tropidonotus taxis pilotus is remark- 

 able for its great size, being perhaps larger than any of our known water serpents ; 

 transversus is a much smaller animal. The markings upon the back and sides 

 correspond in some degree with Say's description of Coluber calligaster, but 

 the scales in C. calligaster are smooth. The latter animal is most probably the 

 one well know as Col. eximius. 



Phrynosoma planiceps. 



Sp. Char. Head more compressed, longer and broader than in P. cornutum ; 

 nostrils within the supraciliary ridge; upper jaw bordered posteriorly by a row 

 of pointed spines ; central spine of the croiarn separated from the two adjacent 

 spines by a wide interval ; front part of head furrowed in the centre ; scales of 

 chin of nearly equal size ; abdominal scales smooth or indistinctly carinated ; 

 tail longer than in cornutum, and less suddenly tapering to a point; ground 

 color of animal light yellow or ash color ; (brown mingled with yellow in 

 cornutum.) 



Dimensions. Length of head 9 lines ; greatest vertical measurement 7 lines; 

 breadth posteriorly, inclading spines, 1 inch 2 lines ; length of body to vent 

 3 inches ; length of tail 1 inch 7 lines ; length of humerus 7 lines ; of fore arm 

 6J ; of hand to extremity of longest finger, including nail, 7| lines; length of 

 thigh 9 lines ; of tibia 9 lines ; of foot to extremity of longest toe nail 9^ lines ; 

 total length 5 inches 4 lines. 



Habitat. Western Texas, near the Rio Grande. 



SCELOPORUS MARMORATUS. 



Sp. Char. Four plates behind the rostral and between the nostrils, the two 

 first more or less linear ; six plates upon the frontal region ; behind these, five 

 plates surrounding one which is pentagonal; posterior to these, midway between 

 the supraciliary ridges, a single large hexagonal plate (intraorbital ;) snout 

 rather pointed, more narrow than in delicaiissimus; body slender; scales bi- 

 punctate posteriorly.

 neck and body to vent 1 inch 5 lines ; length of tail 2 inches 10^ lines ; length 

 of humerus 3 lines ; of fore arm 3 lines ; length of hand to extremity of longest 

 finger 4 lines ; length of thigh 5 lines ; of tibia 5 lines ; of foot to extremity of 

 longest toe 7 lines : circumference of body 14 lines ; total length 4 inches 10 

 lines. 



Habitat. San Antonio, Texas. 



SCELOPORUS DELICAIISSIMUS. 



Sp. Char. Four plates behind the rostral and between the nostrils ; the two 

 first much smaller than the latter; nine plates upon the frontal region, in two 

 rows (four in front and five posteriorly ;) behind these five plates without the 

 central pentagonal one above described; snout somewhat obtuse; body more 

 slender than that of marmoratus ; scales bipunctate posteriorly. 



Dimensions. Length of head 6 lines; greatest breadth 4 lines; length of neck 

 and body to vent 1 inch 5 lines ; length of tail 3 inches 2 lines ; length of hu- 

 merus 3 lines ; of fore arm 3 lines ; of hand to extremity of longest finger 4 

 lines ; of thigh 4 lines ; of tibia 6 lines ; of foot to extremity of longest toe 

 11 lines ; total length 5 inches 1 line. 



Habitat. San Antonio, Texas. 



PSAMMOPHIS FLAVI-GDLARIS. 



Sp, Char. Head long, superior and inferior marginal outline of cranial portion 

 slightly convex ; temples depressed ; body robust ; color light brown or fuscous 

 above ; chin, throat, abdomen, and under part of tail yellow ; 17 rows of scales ; 

 abdominal scuta 130; sub-caudal 97, 




1852.] 179 



Dimensions of largest specimen. Length of head 1 inch 6J lines ; greatest 

 breadth 9 lines ; length of body 3 ft. 5 in. 7 lines ; of tail 9 inches (mutilated;) 

 greatest circumference 3 inches 2 lines. 



Remarks. The animal above described difiFers from the Psammophis flagelli- 

 formis, in being more robust, and in its coloration ; all the specimens brought 

 by Dr. Woodhouse being of a light brown or olive color above, and of a yellow 

 straw color beneath. The specimen of flagelliformis in the collection of the 

 Academy corresponds with the description of Prof. Holbrook, who makes the 

 following observations in regard to its color ; '* The superior surface of the head 

 and neck and nearly one half of the body, is raven black, gradually becoming 

 green on approaching the tail, which is of a very light brown or tawny color ; 

 the scales on the tail are rendered conspicuous by their dark margins. The 

 inferior surface of the neck and anterior part of the abdomen is bluish slate 

 color, the posterior part white clouded with brown ; some parts of the abdomen 

 white and shining, as well as the inferior surface of the tail. This snake, how- 

 ever, varies in color or rather in shade. Bartram has seen them of a cream 

 color, clay colored, and sometimes almost white, but always raven black near 

 the head." The Psammophis flagelliformis appears to be rare. Prof. Holbrook 

 having seen but one specimen during a seven years' search ; and Major Le Conte, 

 who resided a long time in Georgia, informs me that he also has seen but one. 

 The present species, according to Dr. Woodhouse, is very abundant where he 

 discovered it namely, in the sandy region reaching from the frontiers of Texas 

 to the Creek Territory, and designated by a strip of timber extending across it. 

 The specimen under consideration appears also to differ from flagelliformis in 

 the form of the scales, the number of rows of which is the same in both species. 

 In flagelliformis they are more narrow and elongated, resembling the scales of 

 Dendrophis ; in flavi-gularis they are broader, and many of them distiactly 

 hexagonal. The tail is two and a half inches shorter than in flagelliformis, 

 but the body of flagelliformis is eight inches longer. Schlegel observes that 

 the serpents belonging to this genus may be considered as holding a middle place 

 between the terrestrial serpents and those which inhabit trees ; he describes 

 eight species, none of which belong to the United States. The present species, 

 however, is known to ascend trees with great agility, reaching their summits 

 with ease when attacked. 



ELGARIA, Gray. 



Elgaria marginata. 



Sp. Char. Head and upper part of body and tail olive colored; a few minute 

 points along the middle line of the back ; nine or ten transverse bars of black 

 along the sides ; the posterior margin bordered with white ; under surface 

 greenish olive, immaculate. 



Dimensions. Length of head 4| lines ; greatest breadth 2 lines ; length of 

 neck and body to vent 1 inch ; length of tail 1 inch (mutilated ;) length of an- 

 terior extremities to end of the longest of the five fingers 4^ lines ; length of 

 posterior extremities to end of the longest of the five toes 6^ lines. 



Habitat. New Mexico. 



HOMALOSAURUS, Hallowell. 



Gen. Char. Head depressed, covered above with polygonal scales ; nostrils 

 superior; occipital plate distinct; temples not swollen; marginal plates of the 

 upper jaw imbricate; upper surface of neck, body, and tail covered with granu- 

 lations ; abdomen and under surface of the tail with smooth quadrangular scales ; 

 external openings to the ears ; throat folded ; femoral pores ; tail but little 

 longer than the body ; body and entremities slender; 



HOMALOSAURUS VENTRALIS. 



Sp. Char. Head silvery white, with a tinge of yellow ; body above ash- 

 colored, thickly maculated with small white spots irregularly disposed ; trans- 

 verse dark colored bars upon the posterior extremities and base of tail ; abdo- 



28 




180 [October, 



men silvery white, with two longitudinal blue colored blotches having two ob- 

 lique bars of black running across them ; two small blue spots upon the under 

 surface of tail. 



Dimensions. Length of head 7^ lines ; length of neck and body to anus 2 

 inches 2^ lines; of tail in the specimen examined, which appears to have been 

 mutilated and restored, 2 inches 3 lines ; body 1 inch 5 lines in circumference ; 

 length of arm 6 lines ; of fore arm 5^ lines ; of hand to extremity of longest 

 nail 7| lines ; of feet to extremity of longest toe 1 inch 2 lines j total length of 

 body 5 inches 1 line. 



Habitat. New Mexico. 



Remarks. This animal approaches Crotaphytus, Holbrook, but the nostrils 

 are superior instead of being lateral as in the latter genus. The head of Crota- 

 phytus is covered with tubercles, and the occipital plate does not exist, or is 

 small and ill-defined. The forearm is also shorter and much more robust, 

 and the longest fingers are of nearly equal length ; in Homalosaurus the 

 fourth finger is considerably longer than the third. The temples are much 

 less swollen than in Crotaphytus, which has but a single row of plates along ihe 

 border of the lower jaw. The nostrils in Holbrookia are situated as in Homa- 

 losaurus ; and the plates along the margin of both the upper and under jaw 

 have the same configuration and arrangement ; the occipital plate also is 

 very distinct, which, as well as most of the plates upon the upper part of the 

 head, is smooth ; a considerable number of granulations, however, are observed 

 above the supraciliary ridge at its anterior and posterior part, chiefly in the 

 former position ; but in Holbrookia there are no external ears, the ear lying im- 

 mediately beneath the skin, which covers it. Both Holbrookia and Crotaphytus 

 have femoral pores, bat no anal ones, of which also Crotaphytus is destitute. 



Crotalus Lecontei. 



Sp. Char. Head quadrangular, broader behind than in front, much flattened 

 above ; a few small plates in front : the rest of the upper surface of the head, 

 except over the orbit, covered with scales ; a series of about thirty subquad- 

 rate brownish blotches along the back, and ten or twelve transverse bands of 

 the same color ; brownish bands upon the tail ; subquadrate blotches along the 

 back, margined with light yellow ; ground color light yellow or straw-color ; 

 scales strongly carinated ; abdominal scuta 174 ; sub-caudal 27. 



.Dimensions. Length of head 14 lines ; greatest breadth 11 lines; length of 

 body 2 ft. 9 in. 9 lines ; length of tail, exclusive of rattles, 2 inches 6 lines ; 

 length 2 ft. 6 inches 5 lines. 



Habitat. Cross Timbers. 



Remarks. My friend Dr. Le Conte informs me that he found near the 

 Colorado, about seven hundred miles from the last mentioned locality, a species 

 of Crotalus which was very abundant in that region, over four feet in length, 

 and which appears to be the same as the one above described. He took the 

 following notes of it upon the spot: ** Crotalus cinereous ; black with a series 

 of subrhomboidal spots margined with dark brown, and exterior to this a line 

 of white scales ; sides with a few darker cinereous spots; beneath pale ochra- 

 ceous ; neck and under part of head white ; tail white, with four black rings,* 

 becoming irregular beneath. Length 4^- feet ; greatest circumference 5 J inches ; 

 185 transverse scales beneath the body, 28 caudal; fourteen scales in tbe ob- 

 lique rows from spine to side in middle and on neck ; nine posteriorly and on 

 tail. Colorado, March, 1851." The dorsal spots become indistinct behind. 

 Sandy deserts. 



5^ In a young specimen brought by Dr. Woodhouse these four black rings are 

 very distinct. 




1852.] 



181 



PITYOPHIS,* Holbrook. 



PiTYOPHIS AFFINIS. 



Sp. Char. Scales much larger upon the sides than upon the back, where they 

 are comparatively small ; a series of brownish or black subquadrate blotches 

 upon the back ; a row of much smaller blotches on ea^ch side ; transverse bands 

 of jet black upon the tail ; tail short; abdomen and tail thickly maculated with 

 black ; thirty-one rows of carinated scales ; abdominal scuta 221 ; sub-caudal 64. 



Dimensions. Length of head 1 inch 2 lines ; greatest breadth 8 lines ; length 

 of body 2 ft. 5 inches ; of tail 5 inches 5 lines ; greatest circumference 2 inches 

 2^ lines. 



Another specimen was received of the same species as the above, but which 

 presents a remarkable deviation in the form and arrangement of the plates upon 

 the head, which is no doubt abnormal. Thus there are seven plates upon the 

 head, instead of six, as in Pityophis; these are arranged in three rows two 

 plates in the front, two in the middle and three in the posterior; on each side 

 of the middle row is a small quadrangular plate lying immediately above the 

 loral, constituting as it were a superior loral ; there is but one large ant-orbitar 

 and four posterior orbitar on the right side, and three on the left; there are 

 nine superior labials ; abdominal scuta 227 j sub-caudal T 1. 



Habitat. New Mexico. 



Leptophis tjenita. 



Sp. Char. Head much flattened, olive colored with yellow markings ; ground 

 color of body above olive, with two lateral longitudinal yellowish vittae, extend- 

 ing from the occiput to the tail, each middle scale marked with a longitudinal 

 line of black; two lines of black on each side, passing through the middle of 

 two inferior rows of scales from the occiput to a short distance beyond the tail ; 

 abdomen immaculate, except toward the neck, where there are a number of 

 small black spots; abdominal scuta 199; sub-caudal 130; 14 rows of longitu- 

 dinal smooth scales. 



Dimensions. Length of head 9J lines; greatest breadth 5 lines; length of 

 body 1 ft. T in. 5 lines; of tail 9 inches; circumference 1 inch 1 line; total 

 length 2 ft. 5 inches 2\ lines ; abdominal scuta 199 ; sub-caudal 140. 



Habitat. New Mexico. 



BUFO DORSALIS. 



Sp. Char. Above dark brown, with numerous irregular lines of yellow ; a 

 vertical line of yellow continuous with one which is less distinct upon the head ; 

 transverse blotches of black upon the thighs and fore arms ; under surface of 

 the animal ochraceous. 



Dimensions. Length of head 8 lines ; greatest breadth 9 lines ; length of head 

 and body 3 inches ; length of arm 8 J lines ; of fore arm 7 lines ; of hand to ex- 

 tremity of longest finger 10 lines; of leg 14 lines; of tarsus 9 lines; of foot 

 1 inch four lines to extremity of longest toe. 



Habitat. New Mexico. 



Remarks. This animal differs widely from the Bufo cognatus and Americanus, 

 but resembles the lentiginosus, which Prof. Holbrook observes is found, without 

 doubt, all along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico. It differs from it, however, 

 in the elevation of the ridges upon the head, which in lentiginosus are highly 

 developed, giving to the upper part of the head a canaliculated appearance, a 

 condition that does not exist in this species. 



The reptiles above described were collected by my friend Dr. Woodhouse, 

 who was attached to the expedition under command of Capt. L. Sitgreaves, 

 of the corps of Topographical Engineers, for the purpose of exploring the 



"The genus Pityophis is characterized by its projecting snout and the pre- 

 sence of four posterior frontal plates in a transverse row, instead of two, as in 

 the ordinary Colubers and Tropidonotes. These characters, with its peculiar 

 physiognomy, cause it to be readily recognised by one familiar with our reptiles. 




182 [October, 



rivers Zuni and Great and Little Colorado of the West. Too much praise 

 could not be awarded to Dr. Woodhouse, for the zeal and intelligent industry 

 he has manifested in the performance of his arduous duties as physician and 

 naturalist to the Expedition. 



When the reptiles brought from Oregon and California by Mr. Townsend, and 

 those of the Exploring Expedition, shall have been carefully studied, much 

 will have been done toward the attainment of a knowledge of the geographical 

 distribution of our reptiles, to which the admirable work of Prof. Holbrook has 

 so greatly contributed. To him we owe nearly all the knowledge we possess 

 with certainty of North American Herpetology, having brought into order and 

 system what was before uncertain and confused, and in cleir and classical 

 language determined their characters with precision j thus greatly facilitating 

 the labors of all future inquirers. 



ANOTA, Hallowell. 



Gen. Char. Head small, covered above with polygonal plates ; a row of pointed 

 spines posteriorly ; nostrils within the supraciliary ridge : supraciliary ridge 

 but slightly developed, terminating posteriorly in a small pointed spine ; chin 

 covered with smooth granulations of unequal size ; a row of pointed scales on 

 each side ; two gular folds ; no external openings for the ears ; extremities 

 slender; upper surface of body smooth, the numerous pointed species of the 

 ordinary Phrynosomas not existing; no fringe along the lateral margins of the 

 abdomen ; body compressed, oval, tail nearly as long as the body ; femoral 

 pores very distinct. 



Anota M'Callii, 



Sp. Char. Margin of upper jaw denticulated posteriorly; the two posterior 

 of the rows of spines along the margin of the under jaw small ; the two anterior 

 to these quite large ; the two middle spines of thie row upon the occiput much 

 longer than the rest, and incurvated; intermediate spine very small; body light 

 ash color above, with a narrow dorsal line of black extending from the occiput 

 to the root of the tail; two oblong dark colored blotches upon each side of the 

 neck ; two rows on each side of the dorsal line, of dark colored subcircular 

 spots, two in a row, the external larger than the internal ; ground color of upper 

 surface of tail and extremities same as that of the upper surface of the body; 

 under surface of body and extremities silvery white, immaculate; twenty dis- 

 tinct femoral pores on each side. 



Dimensions. Length of head V lines; greatest breadth, exclusive of spines, 

 8 lines ; length of longest spine b\ lines; of the next to it 2J; length of arm 

 "7 lines; of fore arm 5 lines; of hand, to extremity of longest finger, 6 lines ; 

 length of thigh T lines ; of tibia 7 lines ; of foot to extremity of longest toe, 

 7 J lines; length of neck and body to vent 2 inches 4^ lines; length of tail 1 

 inch 8^ lines ; total length 4 inches 5 lines. 



Habitat. Great Desert of the Colorado, between Vallicita and Camp Yuma, 

 about 160 miles east of San Diego. 



Remarks. The animal above described is a Phrynosoraa, the ears of which 

 are concealed by the integument. It was caught by Col. George A. M'Call, of 

 the United States Army, during a recent journey through California and Oregon, 

 and presented by him to the Academy, with two young specimens of Phrynoso- 

 raa coronatum. The great length of its middle posterior spines, its contracted 

 neck and singularly shaped body and tail, give to it a very odd appearance, 

 dififering remarkably from that of any of the known Phrynosomata.

Troi'idonotus concinnus. 



^ Sp. Char. Head slightly swollen at the temples, depressed ; canthus rostra- 



lis grooved ; a longitudinal yellow line running along the median line of the

 in number, do not differ materially from the plates of the Tropidonoti in gene- 

 ral ; the canthus rostralis, or that portion of the side of the head situated between 

 the eye and the extremity of the snout, is distinctly, but not so deeply grooved 

 as in Psammophis; the nostril is situated between two nasal plates, the anterior 

 larger than the posterior ; there is a small quadrilateral frenal plate ; there is 

 one ant-ocular, and three posterior oculars ; a very small part of the ant-ocular 

 plate is seen upon the surface of the head ; the eye is of moderate size, projecting; 

 there is a large temporal plate immediately behind the oculars, and posterior to 

 it are four others ; seven plates margin the upper jaw, of which the fifth and 

 the sixth are the largest ; neck contracted ; body of moderate length, thicker 

 in the middle ; tail about one-fourth the length of the body. There are seven- 

 teen rows of carinated scales. 



Color. Head light chesnut above, deeper in front ; margin of upper jaw, 

 for two thirds of its extent, light olive ; ground color of the body and tail above 

 and upon the sides, raven black ; a yellow band, including one row and the 

 half of each adjoining row of scales, extends from the occiput to the tail, 

 along the middle line of the back ; it is continued upon the tail, but there 

 becomes more narrow ; upon each side of the body, just above the inferior row 

 of scales, is a row of about sixty transverse oblong golden colored spots; one 

 and sometimes two of the intermediate scales is perfectly black ; the spots 

 themselves cover about three rows of scales. Abdominal scuta 156; sub-cau- 

 dal 78. 



Dimensions. Length of head 1 inch ; greatest breadth 6 lines: length of body 

 2 ft. 3 inches length of tail 5 inches 10 lines; greatest circumference 2 inches 

 five lines ; total length 2 ft. 9 inches 10 lines. 



Habitat. Oregon Territory. A specimen in the Museum of the Academy, pre- 

 sented by Dr. Shumard. The most beautiful of the North American serpents 

 hitherto discovered. 



Hyla scapularis. 



iS^. Char. Head small ; body small and slender, olive green above, with nu- 

 merous irregular bluish blotches ; a bluish vitta running from the eye over the 

 shoulder ; total length one and a half inches (Fr.) 



Description. The head is short and small, depressed ; the snout some- 

 what rounded ; the nostrils are small and circular, looking upward and out- 

 ward, about a line apart, situated immediately below the ridge running from 

 the extremity of the snout to the anterior canthus of the eye ; they are nearer 

 the extremity of the snout than the eye; mouth quite large ; the tongue is 

 heart-shaped, quite free behind, notched upon its posterior border; there are 

 two series of palatine teeth between the nostrils, and separated from each other 

 by a narrow intermediate space; the eyes are round and project considerably; 

 the tympanum is small and circular; the body is flattened, rather slender, much 

 contracted posteriorly ; extremities slender ; the upper surface of the body and 

 extremities present numerous small granulations ; abdomen and under surface 

 of extremities much granulated; the granulations upon the abdomen vary in 

 size, and are closely in juxtaposition ; chin and throat granulated. 



Color. Ground color above greenish olive, presenting numerous irregular 

 bluish blotches upon the surface ; several deeper colored blotches upon the 

 sides ; a bluish vitta, about two-thirds of a line in breadth, extends from the 

 posterior part of the eye along the sides of the neck over the shoulder, a short 

 distance beyond which it terminates ; upper surface of extremities marked 

 with bluish spots. 



Dimensions. Length of head 5 lines ; greatest breadth 5 lines ; length of body 

 1 inch ; length of humerus 4 lines ; of fore arm 3 J lines ; of hand to extremity 

 of longest finger 5 lines ; length of thigh 7 lines ; of leg 8 lines ; of foot to ex- 

 tremity of longest toe 7 J lines ; total length 1 inch 5 lines. 



Habitat. Oregon Territory. Piesented to the Academy by Dr. Shumard. 




184 [October, 



The Committee on the following paper by Mr. Cassin, reported in 

 favor of publication in the Proceedings : 



Descriptions of new species of Birds, specimens of which are in the colleC' 

 tion of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 



By John Cassin. 



1. Ammodromus rtificeps, nobis. 



Form. Rather slender ; wings short, with the third, fourth and fifth quills 

 nearly equal and loagest ; tail rather long, with the feathers narrow ; legs long. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 5f 

 inches, wing 2^, tail 2| inches. 



Colors. A conspicuous black line on each side of the throat from the base of 

 the lower mandible. Head above bright reddish chestnut which is also the pre- 

 vailing color of the back, but with the feathers of the latter broadly edged with 

 ashy. Rump and upper tail coverts ash-gray, tinged with the chestnut color of 

 the back. 



Spot on the nares white, running into an ashy superciliary line, ear coverts 

 and below ashy, succeeded by a white line from the lower mandible, which is 

 again succeeded by the black line from its base. 



Throat white tinged with dull brownish ashy, running into deeper shades of 

 the same colors on the other inferior parts, deepest on the breast and with yel- 

 lowish on the flanks and under tail coverts. Wings edged with pale yellow at 

 the flexure, wing coverts and quills fuscous edged with cinereous and reddish. 

 Tail fuscous, tinged and edged with reddish, the two middle feathers reddish 

 brown. 



Bill and tarsi light colored. 



Mab. Calaveras river, California, discovered by A. L. Heermann, M. D. 



Obs. Four specimens of this bird were brought by Dr. Heermann in the fine 

 collection made by him in California. It does not resemble any other species 

 sufficiently to render necessary any designation of comparative characters, 

 and may be easily recognized by its distinct narrow lines of black on the 

 sides of the neck, running from the base of the lower mandible. 



2. Emberiza rostrata, nobis. 



Form. Short and rather heavy, somewhat resembling Peuccea Bachmanii 

 (Aud.) but with the bill and wings longer, the tail shorter, and hardly of the 

 same genus. Somewhat resembles and is generically allied to Emberiza Bairdii, 

 (Aud.), and is about the same size, but has the bill much longer, the tarsi and 

 feet stouter, and the claws stronger and much less curved. Bill lengthened and 

 strong. Wings, with the first, second and third quills longest and nearly equal. 

 Tail rather short, emarginate. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 5|- 

 inohes, wing 2|, tail 2 inches. 



Colors. Entire plumage above dull brownish and cinereous, every feather 

 longitudinally marked with the former and tipped and edged with the latter, 

 the brown stripes being most strongly marked on the head and back. Nar- 

 row, superciliary lines nearly uniting in front. Throat and entire under parts, 

 white, with longitudinal stripes and arrow heads of brown on the breast and 

 flanks ; these stripes forming two lines on each side from the lower mandible 

 and enclosing: a stripe of white. Abdomen and under tail coverts dull white. 



Wings and tail brown, edged with paler shades of the same color, nearly white 

 on the outer webs of the external tail feathers, deeper and tinged with rufous on 

 the wing coverts and exposed edges of the secondaries. Bill and feet light 

 colored, the former brownish above, (in skin.) 



Hub. Sea shore at San Diego, California, discovered by A. L. Heermann, 

 M. D. 



Obs. A plain plumaged bird, of which there are several specimens in Dr. 

 Heermann's collection. It is unlike any other finch that I have ever seen, and 




1862.] 185 



may be recognized by its lengthened and strong bill, which is even stronger than 

 that of Pcuccea Bachmanii. In the general character of its form it approaches 

 E. Bairdii, but is colored differently, is more robust and has the bill much larger. 



3. Spermestes nigriceps^ nobis. 



Form. Small, -with the bill rather large ; wing with the second quill slightly 

 longest ; tail short, but wide and with the feathers broad. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 3i 

 inches, wing If, tail 1^ inches. 



Colors. 5 Head entirely black, which color is extended to the breast and 

 sides of the body, on the latter (the sides) the black plumage is tipped with 

 white. Middle of the abdominal region and under tail coverts white. 



Back and wing coverts bright reddish chestnut, primary quills black with 

 regularly disposed minute spots of white on their outer webs, exposed portion 

 of secondaries reddish chestnut, rump black with minute white spots, tail black. 



Bill and feet light colored (in skin.) 



5, , or ^ juv. Entire plumage above brownish tinged with chestnut on the 

 back, below soiled yellowish or pale whitish brown, with a few black feathers 

 on the throat ; primaries black edged with white ; tail brownish black. 



Hab. Zanzibar. 



Obs. Three specimens of this pretty species belong to the Rivoli collection, 

 and are marked as from Zanzibar. It is similar to no other species of Spermestes 

 with which I am acquainted, but is marked with white spots on the wings like 

 S. poensis, (Frazer). 



4. Spermestes fuscans, nobis. 



Form. Small but robust, and with the bill very strong, wing with the first, 

 second and third quills nearly equal, tail rather long, with the central feathers 

 longest. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 3| inches, 

 wing 2, tail 2 inches. 



Colors. Entire plumage dark chocolate brown, deeper on the throat and around 

 the base of the bill. Inner webs of quills paler and nearly white. Bill horn 

 color. , 



Hab. Borneo. 



Obs. I have not succeeded in finding a description of this little bird, though 

 specimens in the collection of the Academy have been labelled in Europe, " F. 

 nigerrima,'^ and others " ^. aterrima.''^ It is not nearly related to any species 

 known to me, and may be distinguished from all others by its plain uniform 

 plumage. 



5. Ephialtes elegans^ nobis. 



Form. A typical species, bill rather small, wings with the third and fourth 

 quills longest and nearly equal, tail rather short. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 8 J to 9 

 inches, wing 6f, tail 3J inches. 



Colors. Feathers of the ear tufts bright yellowish rufous, every feather mark- 

 ed longitudinally and with irregular transverse bands, and minute points of black, 

 which color is almost confined to the outer webs. Face whitish, every feather 

 with irregular lines and points of brown. 



Entire plumage above pale umber brown, every feather with an obscure longi- 

 tudinal stripe of brownish black and with very numerous irregular narrow lines 

 and points of the same color. Plumage of the neck behind with white spots ob- 

 scurely indicating a collar. 



Inferior surface of the body handsomely mottled with white, light fulvous and 

 brownish black ; the former being the ground color and every feather longitudi- 

 nally striped, and with numerous narrow transverse lines and points of the latter, 

 these stripes most strongly marked on the breast, and least distinct on the 

 abdomen and inferior tail-coverts. Flanks light fulvous ; tarsi reddish, with ir- 

 regular lines and spots of brown. "Wings and tail umber brown, the former with 




186 [October, 



square spots of reddish white on their outer webs, and the latter with numerous 

 irregular lines, and narrow bands of reddish and brown. 



Hah. Northern Asia, Japan ? " En Mer, cotes du Japon, lat. 29 AV N. long. 

 126 13' 30" E." 



Obs. This is one of the handsomest of the small species of owls, and bears some 

 resemblance, rather remote, however, and on a small scale, to the large Horned 

 Owls. It is somewhat like E. semitorques, (Temm.) but wants the white on the 

 throat and breast, and is smaller and differently colored, and has the toes bare. 

 It resembles also to some extent both L. lettia, (Hodg.) and E. lempiji, (Horsf.,) 

 but is larger than either, and otherwise different. The brown stripes and lines 

 on all parts of the plumage are unusually delicate. 



Two specimens are in the collection of the Academy, the more adult of which 

 was obtained by Dr. Wilson from Mr. J. P. Verreaux, of Paris, by whom it was 

 designated as probably an undescribed species. It bears a label indicating the 

 locality as above. 



6. Ephialtes Hendersonii, nobis. 



Form. Resembling E. capensis (Smith) and E. senegaUnsis (Sw.) but smaller 

 than either, and has the bill shorter and weaker ; wing with the third quill 

 longest, but only slightly exceeding the fourth : tail short. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail 6^ inches, 

 wing 5, tail 2\ inches. 



Colors. Generally very similar to those of E. capensis (Smith) and E. sene- 

 galensis (Sw.), but darker and with the fine lines and points of brown through- 

 out the plumage much more numerous and distinct. Entire plumage above 

 cinereous, mixed on the neck, back and rump with bright fulvous, every feather 

 longitudinally striped and with numerous very irregular transverse lines and 

 points of brownish black most distinct on the head and back. Frontal feathers 

 nearly white, tufts and face very pale cinereous, striped longitudinally, and 

 minutely lined with dark brown. Plumage below variegated with white and 

 brown, with a tinge of fulvous, every feather having stripes and minute lines 

 and points, as on the back, but less numerous, with the white predominating 

 and nearly pure on the lower abdomen and under tail coverts. 



Quills brown with quadrangular spots of white on the outer webs. Tail pale 

 cinereous with irregular transverse bars of brown and exhibiting a different 

 style of coloring from either of the species above mentioned. Tarsi nearly 

 white, obscurely spotted with brown. 

 Sexes similar. 



Ilab. Angola. " Came on board U. S. brig Perry off Novo Redondo." Dr. 

 Henderson's label. 



Obs. It is not without some feeling of reluctance that I add another to the 

 several nearly allied and little understood species resembling E. scops, (Linn.) 

 Of these there are several which are clearly distinct and well marked, and the 

 bird at present described is one of this character. My reluctance has arisen 

 from the knowledge, that from the descriptions heretofore published, it is quite 

 impossible for naturalists to identify them, or to ascertain in what manner one 

 differs from another ; and nothing short of actually examining the original spe- 

 cimens in European collections, which was done by Dr. Wilson in 1851, can 

 afford the necessary information. From his notes and from specimens which he 

 procured during his visit to Europe, and from others previously in the collection 

 of the Academy, I have the gratification of entirely coinciding with him in the 

 opinion that the following are distinct, but some of them nearly related species ; 

 Ephialtes scops, (Linn.) from which E. pennaia, (Hodg.) cannot be distinguished; 

 E. capensis, (Smith,) E. sencgalensis, (Sw.,) E. sunia, (Hodg.,) of which I am 

 acquainted with both young and adult, and E. Ilenclersonii, Cassin: and of ano- 

 ther group also resembling E. scops to some extent, the following appear to be 

 different ; E. lempiji (Horsf.) which is J. noctula, Temm., E. javanicm (Less.) 

 E. lettia (Hodg.,) E. spilocephahis (Blyth,) and E. mantis (Temm.,) which is 

 S. rufescens, (Horsf.) Of all these species, specimens and mostly suites are 

 now in the collection of this Academy, and I hope to give, at an early day, the 




1852.] 187 



result of an attempt to arrange them, and to reconcile their synoaymes, in a 

 eecond edition of my catalogue of Strigidice in our collection. 



Of the interesting little bird at preBent described, two specimens, male and 

 female, are in a collection made principally on the coasts of Angola and Ben- 

 guela, during a recent voyage of the U. S. brig Perry, and presented to the 

 Academy by A. A. Henderson, M. D., Surgeon U. S. NavY, who was attached 

 to that vessel as a medical officer. I have taken the liberty of dedicating it to 

 Dr. Henderson as a slight testimonial to his profound and varied scientific ac- 

 quirements, and as a memento of our long-continued and pleasant friendship. 



7. Larut ffeermanni, nobis. 



Form, Bill rather long and slender, wings very long, extending beyond the 

 tail, first primary slightly longest ; tail truncate or slightly emarginate. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 17 J 

 inches, wing 13|, tail 5J, bill from the angle of the mouth to the tip 2 J inches. 



Colors. Bill red, both mandibles tipped with black ; feet and legs dark ; head 

 white, which color gradually fades into an ashy lead color, enveloping the entire 

 body above and below ; darker above and on the wings, and paler beneath. 

 Secondaries tipped with white, which forms an oblique bar of white on the wing. 



Superior coverts of the tail pale cinereous, nearly white. Quills and tail 

 brownish black, the latter tipped with white. Shafts of the two first primaries 

 white on the inferior surface of the wing. 



Young. Rather smaller, total length about 16 inches, wing 13, tail 5, bill 

 from the angle of the mouth 2 inches. Entire plumage brown, dark on the 

 head and paler on the under surface of the body, quills and tail feathers brownish 

 black, the latter narrowly edged at the tip with white. 



Eab. Coast of California at San Diego, discovered by A. L. Heermann, M.D. 



Obs. This beautiful gull appears to belong to a group of species comprising 

 Larus Belcheri, Vigors, L. erythrorynchus, Gould, and others, all of which in- 

 habit the shores of the Pacific ocean. It is most nearly related to L. Belcheri, 

 but is not so large, and has the head pure white, which is not the case in that 

 species. In the description of the latter (in Zool. Jour. iv. p. 328,) the rump 

 is described as white ; in the present bird the rump is dark ashy, but the su- 

 perior coverts of the tail nearly white, and in the young bird they are dark 

 brown. 



I have dedicated this handsome species to my friend Dr. Heermann, as a token 

 of acknowledgment due to his accomplishment as a naturalist, and his great 

 perseverance and success as a scientific traveller. 



8. Mergus americanus, nobis. Wilson's Am. Orn. viii. pi. 68. Aud. B. of Am. 

 pi. 331. 



Obs. I propose this name for the common bird which has hitherto been re- 

 garded as identical with the European species well known as Mergus mergan- 

 ser, Linn. It is, however, specifically quite distinct. In the American bird the 

 prolonged feathers of the head are almost restricted to the occiput and neck be- 

 hind, but in that of Europe they commence almost at the base of the bill, and 

 are erectile and crest-like. On the large wing coverts in the American species 

 there is always an exposed and conspicuous bar of black, which, in the Euro- 

 pean species, is entirely concealed by the lesser coverts. This character is suffi- 

 cient for the purpose of the practical recognition of the two species in all the 

 specimens that I have ever examined, and may be observed on comparing any 

 plates of the two species that I have seen, but especially Wilson Am. Orn. viii. 

 pi. 68; Aud. B. of Am. pi. 331 ; Selby, 111. pi. 57; Gould B. of Eur. v. pi. 39; 

 and Korner Skandinaviska Foglar pi. 57. 



9. Anser parvipes, nobis. 



Form. Generally resembling A. canadensis^ Linn., but not so large, and with 

 the bill and feet much smaller, the latter being not much more than half the 

 size of that species. Upper mandible not so strongly serrated on its edges, 

 tarsi slender, tail rather fully developed. Possibly a Bernicla. 



29 




188 ' [October, 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 28 

 inches, wing 15, tail 6 inches. 



Colors. Much like those of Anser canadensis, Bemicla Hutchiyisii and B. leu- 

 copariea. Large space on the throat and sides of the head white, head above 

 and neck black, back and wings ashy brown, with the feathers having paler tips 

 and edges, rump and tail black, upper tail coverts white; plumage beneath ashy 

 white, with a silky yellowish tinge, and many feathers having darker subtermi- 

 nal stripes ; ventral region and under tails coverts white. 



Hab. Vera Cruz, Mexico. 



Obs. One specimen of this singular bird has been several years in the collec- 

 tion of the Academy, having been presented by its eminent member Marma- 

 duke Burrough, M. D., and collected by him during his residence at Vera Cruz. 

 It resembles the common Anser canadensis in general appearance, but may at 

 once be distinguished by the smaller size of the tarsi and feet, as well as its 

 comparatively small and weaker bill. It is much larger than either Bemicla 

 Hulchinsii or Bemicla leueopariea both of which are in the collection of the 

 Academy. 



The Committee to which was referred Mr. Cassin's " Catalogue of the 

 Halcyonidae in the collection of the Academy," reported in favor of 

 publication. ( |CP See end of the present No.)

Dr. Owen, in presenting to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia 

 a copy of the Geological Map of Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota, just published, 

 made the following remarks : 



The region of country embraced in this geological map extends from latitude 

 38 to 49, and from longitude 89 30' to 96 30^ It has a length, from north 

 to south, of 750 miles, and its greatest width 270 miles, the area being 200,000 

 square miles. Embracing the Mississippi river and all its tributaries, from its 

 source to its junction with the Missouri ; the Missouri river, as high as Council 

 Bluff; the Red river of the north, from its source to the northern boundary of 

 the United States ; together with the northern and southern shores of Lake 

 Superior, from Fond du Lac north to the British dominions, and east to the 

 Michigan line. 



All the calcareous rocks are represented on this map by tints of blue; the 

 pure calcareous rocks being of pure blue tints, while the magnesio-calcareous 

 or dolomitic rocks are of shades of purple blue; the sandstones, of yellow; the 

 coal measures, of sepia; the metamorphic schists, of purple; the metamor- 

 phosed rocks, of Silurian date, of orange ; while all the igneous rocks are of 

 bright red colors. 



A very large tract of the northern regions of this district, being more than 

 one half of the country, is overspread with extensive drift deposites, penetrated 

 only at a few limited and distant points, (these chiefly in the deep cuts of the 

 streams,) by igneous rocks and metamorphic schists; except along the height 

 of land dividing the waters of Lake Superior and the Mississippi ; on the north 

 west shore of Lake Superior and the region bordering on the British dominions, 

 where the exposure of granite, gneiss, and metamorphic schists and trappose 

 rocks, are rather more extensive. 



The drift consists of deposites of sand, gravel clays of great thickness, of 

 marls, and, locally, of erratic blocks. The summit levels of this region are 

 from 500 to 1100 feet and more above Lake Superior.

190 [November, 



A considerable portion of the southern and eastern part of this drift is 

 based on the lowest protozoic sandstones of lower Silurian date; which forma- 

 tion is best explored in a semicircular belt east of the Mississippi and up the 

 Valley of the Wisconsin as high as Point Boss ; and bearing northeast to the 

 Michigan boundary line. 



These lower Protozoic Sandstones have proved themselves far more fossili- 

 ferous than the corresponding strata in the State of New York the Potsdam 

 sandstone ; having yielded, besides the two small Lingulas,^. antiqua qm A prima, 

 of New York, four new genera of trilobites and at least nine or ten new species; 

 which is the more remarkable since no remains of crustaceans had previously 

 been found lower than the Trenton, Black river and Chazy limestones. 



In the ascending order succeeds the Lower Magnesian Limestone, reaching 

 the surface to the southwest of the Protozoic sandstones; characterized chiefly 

 by gasteropodous mollusca, allied to Pleuroiomaria, Ophileia and Strappa- 

 rolus. They are represented by the deeper purple blue tinis, and correspond in 

 age to the calciferous sandrock of New York. 



With the intervention of non-fossiliferous sandstones, from forty to eighty 

 feet in thickness, often composed of limpid grains of quartz, there is superim- 

 posed on this formation, beds of shell-limestone of the age of the Trenton and 

 Black river limestone of New York, and the blue limestones of Ohio and In- 

 diana, containing Leptcena alternata, sericea, deltoidea, Orthis testudenarta, 

 occidentalism suboequata, Atrypa capax^ modesta, Isoielus ffiffas, Calymena 

 senaria, besides a great; variety of other fossils found in the corresponding 

 strata in Ohio, Indiana and New York, besides many new species. Though 

 somewhat magnesian, these beds are the purest limestone of Silurian date in 

 the district. 



Next succeeds, on the south, the lead-bearing beds of the upper magnesian 

 limestone, colored Prussian blue, and containing Spirifer lynx^ hiforatus, Lin- 

 gula quidrata and a few other fossils of the Trenton limestone, Utica slate and 

 Hudson river group. This formation is represented of a lighter shade of purple 

 blue. This part of the Upper Magnesian Limestone of Wisconsin has yielded 

 latterly upwards of 50,000,000 of pounds of lead annually, and is about three 

 hundred feet thick. 



The upper 200 feet of upper magnesian limestone of Wisconsin, form what 

 we have designated the Coralline and Pentamerus beds, from the abundance of 

 Catenepora esckaroides and Pentamerus oblongus, formed towards the top of this 

 formation, which corresponds to the Niagara and Clinton groups of New York. 

 To the southwest of this, crossing the Mississippi, near its upper or Rock- 

 island rapids, is a very pure calcareous formation, containing Atrypa reticularis, 

 aspera, Orthus resupinata, Phocops macropthalma, and a variety of Spirifers, 

 most of which are new species, allied to those of the Hamilton and Corniferous 

 groups of New York, with extended hinge, and often with wide cardinal area?, 

 and mostly smooth on the bourrelet or mesial fold. Also many of the corals 

 found in the Onondaga limestone of New York and the limestones of the Eifel 

 in Germany. 



Much of the limestone of this formation has a close texture, smooth surface 

 and conchoidal fracture, approaching to lithographic limestones. 



The valley of the Mississippi, below Muscatine, is occupied by a zone of 

 carboniferous limestone, which we divide into the upp^r and loner series, the 

 former characterized by Lithostrotion basalti/orme, several species of Produc- 

 tus, the Spirifers and Terebratulce ; the latter by the ^rc^mtf/e^, a great variety 

 of Pentramites and Crinoidea, Productus punctatus, Spirifer cuspida'us, Sptrifcr 

 striatus, and remains of Psammodus and other fossil fishes ; besides a variety 

 of other species of organic remains. These beds of limestones encircle the 

 Iowa and Missouri coal-field, and separate it from the Illinois coal-field, with 

 which it may have been once in connection, before the denudation of the Mis- 

 siesippi Valley; but they are now separated by a belt of from 25 to 50 miles 

 of this Bubcarboniferous limestone, now encroached upon only by a few outliers 

 of the coal measures near the Keokuk rapids of the Mississippi. 



The Iowa and Missouri coal-field, now for the first time laid down on a geo- 




1852.] 



191 



logical map, comprises in all about 50,000 square miles, nearly one half of 

 which lies in Iowa, and the other half in Missouri. From north to south this 

 coal-field is about 300 miles, and from east to west about 200. 



This coal-field is shallow, hardly exceeding fifty fathoms, and the coal-bear- 

 ing strata proper hardly 100 feet. It seems to be the attenuated part of the 

 great coal-field east of the Mississippi. It contains from four to six workable 

 beds of coal, which, in Iowa, vary from two to five or five and a half feet. 

 Towards the southern margin of tbis coal-field, in Missouri, there are beds of 

 great thickness 20 feet or more of a character intermediate between cannel 

 coal and asphaltum. 



The coal of this coal-field is all highly bituminous and most slaty in its struc- 

 ture ; very frequently presenting the woody fibre on the surface of the natural 

 joints as distinctly displayed as on charcoal. 



On the extreme south of this map will be observed, close to the southern 

 margin of this coal-field, an uplift of magnesian limestone and sandstone of 

 lower Silurian date, bordering on the lead region of Missouri, and to be found on 

 both sides of the Missouri river, between Tavern Rock and Marion ; here the 

 carboniferous and lower Silurian rocks, are in close proximity and much 

 blended together. 



To the extreme west of the map, on the Missouri river, opposite the mouth of 

 Floyd's river, the green represents the cretaceous formation which extends 

 west of the Missouri river towards the heads of the Cheynne, ilcreau and 

 White rivers, where it is succeeded by that remarkable Eocene tertiary basin 

 in the Mauvaise Terres of Nebraska, containing those interesting extinct races 

 of fossil mammalia described by Dr. Leidy in the Memoir forming part of the 

 geological report. 



Many important additions will be found to our geographical knowledge of the 

 country, derived partly from drafts and astronomical observations made by th 

 geological corps, and partly from the most recent linial surveys. 



For further particulars I beg to refer the members to the forthcoming geolo- 

 gical report of the surveys of the region of country represented by this geolo- 

 gical map. 



November 16^A. 

 Vice-President Bridges in the Chair. 



A note was read from Mr. Elias Durand, dated Nov. 15, 1852, accom- 

 panying his donation, acknowledged this evening, of 109 autographs of 

 Scientific and Literary men. 



Dr. B. H. Coates stated that he had been referred by a friend to a passage ia 

 page 136, of a work entitled "The Unity of the Human Races, proved to be the 

 doctrine of Scripture, Reason and Science ; by the Rev. Thomas Smyth, D. D. 

 New York, 1850" in which his name is cited, with those of several others, as 

 that of an "opponent" of the doctrine or dogma of the Unity of the Human 

 Species ; and this on the authority of the late Dr. Morton. Dr. Coates had no re- 

 collection of the passage in any of the writings of his late honored friend just named, 

 or of any other, in which such a statement had been made for him ; and could only 

 presume that Dr. Smyth has either misapprehended some expression in Dr. 

 Morton's books, or has quoted from memory without referring to the text. Dr. 

 Coates hoped to be allowed to have placed upon record in the Proceedings of the 

 Academy an explicit denial of the above allegation, having never held the opinion 

 there implied as his. He acquiesces in what he believes to be the general 

 judgment of the most scientific men the unity of the human species without 

 claiming to have formed an independent opinion; but he is not ignorant that 

 some strangely marked varieties, as the Ethiopian, are of a very high antiquity. 



The proposition frequently combined with the above, that the origin of the 




192 [November, 



whole human race is from a single couple, and that such is the legitimate con- 

 struction of the biblical passages mentioning Adam and Eve, did not appear to 

 him to be a question in Natural History ; that is, he conceives it to be impossible, 

 from any natural evidence now existing upon the surface of the earth, either to 

 prove or disprove this proposition, or to render it more probable or improbable, 

 and that it must, therefore, rest for its certainty upon revelation, records and the 

 grammatical construction and just verbal meaning of an ancient language. 



November 2od. 



The President, Mr. Ord, in the Chair. 



A letter was read from the Secretary of the Acad. C. L. C. Naturae 

 Curiosorum, dated Breslau, 28th Aug. 1852, presenting the volume 

 of its Transactions acknowledged this evening. 



Dr. Leidy presented a paper from M. Tuomey, entitled " Description 

 of some fossil shells from the Tertiary of the Southern States,'' which, 

 being intended for publication, was referred to a committee, consisting of 

 Dr. Leidy, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. Charles E. Smith. 



Dr. Woodhouse presented a paper for publication, describing a new 

 species of Numenius ; which was referred to Mr. Cassin, Dr. Wilson 

 and Dr. Heermann. 



Dr. Owen presented for inspection by the members, a copy of his Re- 

 port of the Geological Survey of Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota, and 

 called attention to some of the illustrations, which were produced by an 

 entirely new method ; the copy of the fossil being medal-ruled on the 

 steel plate from the object itself.

Description of some Fossil Shells from the Tertiary of the Southern States. 

 By M. TcoMEY, Prof, of Geology, Univ. of Alabama. 



The fossils described in this paper are from a well known locality at Wil- 

 mington, N. C. The bed in which they were found is a coarse calcareous con- 

 glomerate resembling, in mineral composition, the compact white limestone of 

 the Santee. 



Sir Charles Lyell described this structure in the first volume of the Quar- 

 terly Journal of the Geological Society of London, and referred it to the Eocene. 

 In a report on the geology of South Carolina I pointed out the existence of one 

 or two Cretaceous forms /Ammonites placenta, Morton, and a Trigonia related 

 to T. thoracica, Morton, in the same bed, together with Eocene fossils. 



Some of the fossils described are much larger than any occurring in the 

 Eocene, yet as a group, no one acquainted with our Cretaceous and Eocene 

 fossils could hesitate in referring them to the latter. Besides, Sir Charles 

 Lyell has given a list, from this locality, of several species found elsewhere in 

 the Eocene. 




1852.] 193 



As the deposit is a, conglomerate and in the vicinity of cretaceous beds, it 

 would occur to any one that the presence of a few cretaceous forms could be 

 easily explained by supposing the breaking up of a cretaceous bed, and the 

 transportation of its debris and included fossils into the eocene sea, where they 

 were entombed with the molluscous remains of that period. Nevertheless it is 

 evident that the cretaceous shells were filled at the eame time, and with the 

 same mineral matter as those of the eocene found with them, for the casts of 

 both are composed of compact white limestone. Now, excepting the stratum 

 on Timber Creek, New Jersey, none of our cretaceous deposits could furnish 

 the mineral matter of either the casts of these shells or the rock in which they 

 are enclosed. Between the Delaware and Chattahoochee the cretaceous rocks 

 are made up of loose, grey, loamy and silicious strata, without white creta- 

 ceous beds ; and in Alabama, the rotten limestone, which is the prevailing rock, 

 is entirely different from the Wilmington bed ; even the cretaceous deposit in 

 the vicinity, from which it might be supposed these remains were derived, is 

 composed of the usual dark-colored silicious stratum of green sand. It would 

 be equally difficult to account for the presence of these fossils, by supposing 

 that they remained empty and were subsequently drifted into the eocene sea, 

 and there filled with sedimentary matter and buried with the forms of that 

 period. At all events, after a careful examination of the locality, as well as 

 the fossils, I could satisfy myself only by supposing the inhabitants of these 

 shells to have lived and died during the eocene period, to have been cotempora- 

 neous with the forms with the remains of which they are buried. 



The fossils to be described are for the most part in the form of casts : fre- 

 quently, however, casts of both the interior and exterior of the shells occur, 

 and they are generally so characteristic that there can be but little danger of 

 mistake, if even hereafter the shells themselves should be found. 



1. Trochus nixus : large ; axis very oblique ; whorls 5 or 6, flat or slightly 

 concave, marked by revolving lines obsoletely cancellated ; suture of the cast 

 deep, of the shell basely impressed ; umbilicus open, deep. 



JDimen. Spiral angle 75 j hr. 4; br. 5 in. 



2. Pyrula ampla : ventricose, ovate ; epire depressed ; whorls 4, last one 

 very large. 



Dimen. Spiral angle 100 ; ht. 6in. ; br. 4-5 in. 



This fossil is also found in the white limestone of the Santee. 



4. Fdsus abruptus : ovoid ; whorls rounded, ventricose, the last one termi- 

 nating abruptly in the canal. 



Dimen. Spiral angle 70 ; ht. 6 in. ; br. 4 in. 



4. CoNus MUTiLATUS : Spire depressed ; whorls flattened ; sides longitudinally 

 convex. 



Dimen. Spiral angle 101; ht. 2-5 in. ; br. 1-5 in. 



Casts of shell are abundant at Wilmington, N. C, and in the white limestone 

 of Alabama. It is also found in the eocene beds on the Santee. TLey are 

 easily distinguished from the other eocene species. In C. gyratus^ Morton, the 

 spire is more produced ; whilst in C. i?auridens^ Don., it is more depressed. 

 Casts of the latter have the spiral whorls in nearly the same plane. 



5. VoLUTA coNoiDEs: conical ; spire short; whorls 4, columcllar plaits nu- 

 merous. Resembles Conus gyratus. 



Dimen. Spiral angle 87; ht. 2 in. ; br. 1 in. 



6. Trigonia divaricata: cast of left valve, ribs 15, somewhat acute, con- 

 verging towards the posterior margin, arched on the umbones, diraricating be- 

 low. After the sixth rib there is a half rib intercalated. 



Dimen. Length 2 in.; br. 1*5 in. ; ht. 1 in. 



7. T. LCNATA : ribs 14, rounded, slightly ventricose; posterior margin cre- 

 nulated. 



Dimen. Length 1-75 in. ; br. 125 in. ; ht. 1 25 in. 




194 [NOVEMBEK, 



This and the preceding are distinguished from T. tkoracica, Morton, by their 

 greater length compared with their breadth, as well as by the more round ribs. 



8. Cardita trapezium : shell rhomboidal, cordate ventricose, ribs acute, 

 crossed by coarse incremental lines. 



Dimen. Length 225 in.; br. 2 in. ; ht. 2 in. 



This shell differs from C. alticosta. Con., in outline, as well as in being more 

 ventricose, and having less prominent ribs. 



9. CccuLL^ LiEVis : shell smooth or marked by increment lines, ribs none ; 

 umbones ventricose; beaks nearly central; hinge area wide; plate of anterior 

 muscular impression extending from the beaks to the margin, wide. 



Dimen. Length 4-25 in. ; br. 3'5 in. 



This fossil can be distinguished from C. vulgaris, which it resembles, by the 

 smooth exterior, and deep and long muscular impression. 



10. Arca cancellata: shell thin, very inequilateral, cancellated by radiating 

 lines and approximating transverse lines ; umbones prominent ; beaks close ; 

 hinge-line slightly curved; posterior margin rounded, compressed; anterior 

 margin much contracted. 



Dimen, Length 25 in.; br. 3*5 in.

 Wilson. The color, however, is much lighter and more rufous, the bill short 

 and very slender, the primaries are more pointed ; their inner web is not so 

 broad. Wings extend about half an inch beyond the tail. Toes short and 

 slender.

Color. Feathers of the top of the head have a broad central line of blackish 

 brown, terminating on their side by whitish brown ; neck light reddish brown, 

 the shaft of each feather being black and terminating by a broad blackish-brown 

 spot. ThosB of the hind part of the neck have the central line of black much 

 broader. Chin white. Back black with irregular markings of reddish brown, form- 

 ing spots: these, as they approach the rump, become more reddish and are broader, 

 having much the appearance of bands. Upper tail coverts reddish brown ;

axUlaries, inner wing coverts, bright reddish brown. Bill blackish brown. 

 Legs and feet flesh color. A pale supraciliary line extends from the base of 

 the bill. 



Habitat. Rio Grande, New Mexico. 



Obs, This remarkable species is closely allied to the N. longirostris and N. 

 Hudsonicus, but from both of them it differs very materially. I procured it near 

 Albuquerque, on the Rio Grande, whilst attached to the Expedition, as Surgeon 

 and Naturalist, under the command of Captain L. Sitgreaves, Topographical 

 engineer U. S. army, exploring the Zuni and the Great and Little Colorado 

 rivers of the west. There were but few of them there at the time. They 

 were on the sandbars of the river, feeding upon worms and insects.

 which were adopted : 



Every manifestation of dispoBition in the officers of the National and State 

 governments to encourage the pursuit of truth, by affording facilities to men 

 devoted to scientific investigations, is pleasing to the members of the Academy 

 of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, Aware of the important influence of sci- 

 entific researches on the prosperity and happiness of the people, they are gra- 

 tified to observe that the recent report of the Hon. John P. Kennedy, on the 

 condition of the navy, is in tone and spirit cheering to tho-e who are seeking to 




1852.] , 197 



expand the limits of human knowledge ia any of its branches. While asking 

 Congress to augment the means of instructing young men for dififerent depart- 

 ments of the naval service, he pleads the cause of science in a manner worthy 

 of that enlightened judgment which should characterise all who participate in 

 the direction of nautical affairs. He announces that expeditions to Japan, to 

 the China Seas, to Africa, to the interior of South America, to the Pacific 

 Ocean, and to the Arctic regions, are in progress, or about departing to seek 

 and peacefully open new fields of enterprise ; and while he incites the spirit of 

 hardy adventure, he encourages, to the extent of the means in his power, care- 

 ful observation and scientific investigation of natural phenomena. He advocates 

 explorations which promise results beneficial to the agricultural, commercial 

 and manufacturing industries of the country ; and for motives apparently ana- 

 logous to those which animate the members of this institution. Therefore, 



Resolved, That the Corresponding Secretary be directed to address a letter to 

 the Hon. John P. Kennedy, Secretary of the Navy, expressive of the gratifica- 

 tion the Society derives from the disposition he manifests to encourage men 

 engaged in the cultivation of science ; a disposition more especially exhibited 

 in the permission given to our fellow member, Dr. E. K. Kane, of the Navy, to 

 undertake the direction and management of an expedition to the north polar 

 regions, to ascertain the fate of Sir John Franklin ; an enterprise sustained by 

 the intelligent munificence of Henry Grinnell, Esq., and a few other American 

 gentlemen. 



Resolved, That science does not limit its benefits and influence to any class 

 or caste of men ; being open and free to all alike, it is republican and democratic 

 in its tendency ; and therefore, the members of the Academy of Natural 

 Sciences of Philadelphia may hope that the National Legislature will foster the 

 several expeditions embracing scientific research, by granting such seasonable 

 supplies and substantial encouragement as may be worthy of the most powerful 

 and wealthy republic on the face of the earth. 



Resolved, That the Corresponding Secretary is hereby instructed to furnish a 

 copy of these resolutions to the President of the Senate of the United States, 

 and to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, for the information of 

 Congress, and also to the Secretary of the Navy. 



On leave, granted, Mr. Cassin, from the Committee on Dr. Heer- 

 mann's paper, entitled ^^ Notices of Birds observed in California,'^ 

 reported in favor of publication in the Journal of the Academy, which 

 was adopted.

Mr. Cassin presented a paper by P. R. Hoy, M. D., of Racine, Wis- 

 consin, intended for publication in the Proceedings, describing two 

 species of Owls, presumed to be new, inhabiting the State of Wisconsin 

 during the winter season. Referred to Mr. Cassin, Prof. Haldeman 

 and Dr. Heennann. 



Mr. Conrad presented a paper intended for publication in the Pro- 

 ceedings, entitled, " Notes on Shells, and descriptions of new species.''

 Le Conte, Prof. Haldeman and Dr. Leidj. 



Dr. G-enth presented a paper, intended for publication in the Pro- 

 ceedings, entitled, " On a probably new Element, with Iridosmene and 

 Flatinum, from California." Referred to Prof. Frazer, Dr. Le Conte 

 and Dr. Bridges. 



Prof. Haldeman stated that he had seen, at the recent agricultural exhibition 

 at Lancaster, Pa., a pair of albino specimens of Tamias lysieri (or striata) ; also 

 a black specimen of the same species ; which would throw light upon the varieties 

 of the grey squirrels, since it is more likely that these should have black varie- 

 ties than the uniform species of Tamias. The specimen was black throughout, 

 and there were no indications of the lateral stripes, A few scattered hairs of 

 white might be observed on a close inspection. Prof H. stated further that he 

 had had an idiotic specimen of Sciurus Hudsonius, which had the actions of 

 a human idiot. It was thus affected when caught, and was merely able to take 

 its food, but incapable of running or leaping. Its principal actions were turning 

 in a circle aod moving the head up and down continually.

Remarks on the Tertiary Strata of St. Domingo and Vickshurg^ (^Miss.) 



By T. A. CoNEAD. 



The remarkable group of fossils which I discovered at Vicksburg, Miss., in 

 1845, derives a new interest for the geologist since the discovery of an analogous 

 deposit in St. Domingo, in which are some few of the species of the Vicksburg 

 strata. Whether all the forms of this group in St. Domingo are synchronous 

 remains to be proved, but the probability is that they are. They have been 

 referred to the Miocene period, whilst I had supposed that the Vicksburg 

 strata were more intimately related to those of the Eocene period. I founded 

 this supposition on the following data, viz : 



1. No recent species was known, or is yet ascertained to occur in this 

 locality, 



2. Two or three fossil shells of the Older Eocene of Alabama are common. 



3. No species is identical with, and only two or three analogous to, fossil 

 shells of the American Miocene, even as the group occurs in South Carolina, but 

 little north of the latitude of Vicksburg. 



4. The forms have a closer analogy with those of the European Eocene than 

 with any other group of fossils. 



It might be supposed that a more southern latitude would vary the Miocene 

 species, but not thnt the percentage of recent shells would be reduced to zero, 

 nor would an utterly dissimilar group be introduced. The only condition which 

 would seem likely to produce such a result would be a great depth of water, in 

 which the shells had lived and died on the bed of aprofounder sea than wehave 

 elsewhere eny evidence of; but this is not probable, because the presence of so 




1852.] 199 



many littoral genera as Pleurotoma, the species of which are very abundant in 

 specimens, TurritcUa, Natica, Terebra, Oliva, and various others, indicate shallow 

 water, and the abundance of comminuted shells and waterworn specimens attest 

 the vicinity of a sea beach. 



The well known Miocene deposits are remarkably unlike that of Vicksburg, 

 in the abundance of large species of Venus, Fulgur, Perna, and Panopoea, some of 

 which genera, with their peculiar species in every latitude, render the Miocene 

 period recognizable at a glance. Indeed it is singular that the distinctive cha- 

 racter of this formation should be so strongly marked over an extent of 400 

 miles north and south. Even the Venus alveata, a common Maryland fossil, 

 seems to be abundant beneath the level of the sea, on Sullivan's Island, near 

 Charleston, and another Maryland fossil, which I have named Ecphora -i-costata^ 

 {Fu^us A-costaius oi Say,) was found on the beach of St. Simon's Island, Georgia. 

 Both localities are south of the latitude of Vicksburg, the Georgia one nearly a 

 degree farther south. The researches of Mr. Tuomey, in South Carolina, have 

 brought to light at least 26 species, which are known to occur as far north as 

 St. Mary's river, Maryland. From this comparison of groups it seems obvious 

 that the Vicksburg deposit must be of earlier origin than the fossiliferous Ter- 

 tiary strata of Maryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina, which seem all 

 to be of one geological era, though Mr. Tuomey refers those of South Carolina 

 to the Older Pliocene period. Whether the Mississippi formation should be 

 termed an Older Miocene or a Newer Eocene, may yet be doubtful, but that it 

 is intermediate between the Lower and Middle Tertiary, and differing widel/ 

 from either in the period of its deposition, is obvious. 



A careful exploration of the St. Domingo locality will probably clear up all 

 doubts on the subject. 



In conclusion, I may observe, that besides the Turbinella Wilsoni and Oniscia 

 harpula, the Cassidaria Icevigata, Forbes, is identical with my C. liniea, thus 

 giving three species common to the Vicksburg and St. Domingo groups.

The name of this genus, founded on i/ya cancellata, having been previously 

 applied by Turton to another group of bivalves, and now adopted by some 

 conchologists, it is necessary to change it, and I therefore propose

Description of a New Species of Pouched Rat of the Genus Geomys, Raf. 



By S. W. WooDHOusE, M. D. 



Geomys fulvus. 



Characters. Light reddish brown above, beneath whitish. Ears small, 

 round, and covered with thick short black fur. Tail long in proportion when 

 compared with others of this genus. 



Description. Head large, nose broad, covered with short thick fur, with the 

 exception of a small space at tip and the margins of the nostrils, which are 

 naked. The nose extends a short distance beyond the plane of the incisors. 

 The incisors are exserted, with three (fonvex smooth sides, the exterior broadest, 

 and of a yellowish color ; their cutting edges are , even. The upper incisors 

 extend downwards and inwards ; the under ones are one-third longer than the 

 upper, and slightly narrower. Ears small and round, covered with short thick 

 black fur externally. Eyes larger than is common in this genus. Tail round, 

 thick at base, and gradually tapering. The fore claws are long, compressed, 

 slightly curved and pointed. The claw on the middle toe is the longest, the 

 fifth is the shortest, and that of the thomb resembles much the claw of the 

 fourth toe of the hind foot, both as regards size and shape. The toes on the 

 hind feet are a little longer and more slender than those of the fore feet ; the 

 nails short, somewhat conical and excavated underneath. 



Color. Head, cheeks, back and sides bright reddish brown, being darker on 

 the top of the head and back. The breast, vent, feet, inner portion of legs and 

 thighs white, slightly inclining to ash ; abdomen very light reddish brown ; for at 

 base dark ash color above, beneath light ash. Edges of cheek pouches encircled 

 with rufous ; the long hair of the back extends about one third the length of the 

 tail. The tail is covered with short white silky hairs, terminating in a small 

 tuft. The fore feet above are covered with short white hair ; the toes on their 

 inner side have a row of long white hairs ; palms naked. Claws are opaque, 

 white for half their extent, the other half transparent; there is a small oblong 

 reddish brown spot in the centre of each. The hind feet are covered above with 

 white hairs, soles naked. The lips, on their inner side, are covered with short 

 fine white hair, with a band of short fine black fur encircling the mouth. 

 Whiskers silvery white.

 Scapular feathers and^^lesser wing coverts greyish brown ; the measurements 

 differ but little from those of the male, being slightly smaller. 



Habitat. Western Texas and New Mexico. 



Obs. My attention was first called to this bird by my friend Mr. John Cassin, 

 who very kindly suggested an examination of several specimens of mine in the 

 collection of the Academy in connection with another in his possession, and a 

 female in the collection, made by me when attached to the Exploring party under 

 the command of Capt. Sitgreaves, Topographical Engineer. U. S. Army, in the 




1852.] 203 



San Francisco Mountain, New Mexico. One of the specimens in the collection 

 of the Academy is from Mexico, the others are from Texas. My specimen is 

 from New Mexico. When obtained it was feeding in company with S. oregonns 

 and various species of Parus, and it appeared very similar to the former and 

 the common snow bird (S. hyemalis) in its habits.

By Edward Hallowell, M. D. 



DiNOPHIS Hallowell. 



Gen. Char. Form, that of a tree snake ; perforated fangs in the anterior part 

 of the upper jaw, immovable; several of the anterior teeth of the lower jaw 

 longer than the others ; but two rows of teeth in the upper jaw, the exterior row 

 not existing; two rows in the lower jaw, quite short; no loral plate; 4 poste- 

 rior,* 3 anterior orbital plates ; tail long, sub-caudal scales bifid. 



DiNOPHIS Hammondii. 



Sp. Char. Head olive color above, superior labials bordered with black ; 

 body above and upon sides green; total length about six feet; thirteen rows of 

 long and smooth scales. Abdom. scuta 127. Sub-caud. 116. 



Description. The head is long, rounded and narrow in front, covered above 

 with nine plates ; the upper surface in front of the orbit is flattened ; between 

 the orbit it is convex, and also, but to a less extent, upon the occiput; the ros- 

 tral is large, heptagonal, much broader below than above, excavated inferiorly, 

 rounded in front; the anterior frontal are much smaller than the posterior, and 

 are more or less quadrilateral in shape ; the posterior frontal are very large, 

 irregularly quadrilateral; they are prolonged externally upon the sides of the 

 head, passing downward between the posterior nasal and the two superior ant- 

 ocular plates ; the vertical plate is short, very broad anteriorly ; the supra- 

 orbital are also short, projecting very slightly over the eye, naxrow in front, 

 broad behind ; the occipital are very large and pentangular, much larger than 

 broad ; there are two nasal plates of nearly equal size, the anterior somewhat 

 larger, with the nostrals between them ; the external openings for the latter are 

 quite large; there is no loral plate; there are three antocular and four poste- 

 rior-oculars; the superior antocular is the largest of the three; it is prolonged 

 superiorly, so as to form a part of the upper surface of the head, entering in be- 

 tween the posterior frontal and the vertical and supra-orbital plates ; the inferior 

 antocular is small and quadrilateral, the middle long and slender ; there are eight 

 plates upon the margin of the upper jaw ; of these the seventh is the largest, and 

 is remarkable for its unusual form ; its superior margin is nearly straight, its pos- 

 terior and inferior very much curved ; the plate on the leftside in the specimen 

 examined differs considerably from that on the right, being more prolonged, and 

 also truncated posteriorly ; the fourth labial plate forms part of the inferior 

 margin of the orbit, the remainder being completed by the inferior, anterior, 

 and posterior oculars ; there is a long, triangular, temporal plate occupying 

 the space between the occipital and the seventh superior labial ; the eyes are 

 of moderate size, slightly projecting ; there are but two rows of teeth in the 

 upper jaw, one on each side, and two in the lower ; in the front part of the 



* In one of the specimens there are but three posterior oculars. 




204 [December, 



upper jaw, immediately below the nostril, on each side of the head, is a curved 

 and perforated immovable fang about three lines in length ; there is no pit be- 

 tween the eye and the nostril, and this space is not channelled as in L. gracilis 

 and Kirtlandii ; several of the anterior teeth in the lower jaw are much larger 

 than the others ; the longest is slender and deeply fissured anteriorly. The neck 

 is contracted, the body long, thicker about the middle, covered above with long 

 and smooth quadrangular scales, arranged in thirteen rows ; the scales nearest 

 the abdomen are shorter than the others ; the tail is quite long, covered above 

 with four rows of short hexagonal scales, with margins more or less rounded 

 posteriorly ; the plates upon the under part of the tail are bifid. 



Color. Head olive colored above, lighter upon the sides ; the posterior margins 

 of the labial plates black; posterior margin of inferior labials also black; neck, 

 upper part and side of body green, the scales upon the posterior part of the 

 body bordered with black ; abdomen greenish, without spots or blotches ; tail 

 greenish olive, many of the scales bordered with black. 



Dimensions. Length of head 1 inch 4 lines ; greatest breadth 9 lines ; length 

 of the body 3 ft. 11 inch. 2\ lines; length of tail 1 ft. 5 inch. *l lines; total 

 lenth 5 ft. 7 inch. 2 lines ; greatest circumference 2 inch. 8 lines. 



I have named this serpent after my friend Ogden Hammond, Esq., of Charles- 

 ton, S. Carolina. 



Dimensions of a larger specimen. Length of head 1 inch 6 lines ; greatest 

 breadth 11 lines; breadth between the orbits posteriorly 9 lines; length of 

 body 4 ft. 62^ inches ; of tail 1 ft. 5 inch. 9 lines ; total length 6 ft. 1 in. 9^ lines ; 

 greatest circumference 3 inches. Abdom. scuta 225; 112 pairs of subcaudal 

 plates. 



Habitat. Liberia, W. Africa : Two specimens in the Museum of the Academy, 

 presented by Dr. Goheen. 



Remarks. The dentition of this animal is very remarkable, no serpent with 

 which I am acquainted having a single immovable perforated fang on each side 

 of the anterior portion of the upper jaw. It is well known to Herpetologists 

 that, although in Vipera, Naja, and other genera of venomous snakes, the exte- 

 rior row of teeth is wanting ; the poisonous fangs in certain serpents have behind 

 them a number of smaller grooved teeth. This condition exists, according to 

 Prof. Owen, in all the family of marine serpents, four such being found in Hy- 

 drophis striata, and five in Hydrophis schistosa. This is the case also in Bun- 

 garus, a land serpent, and in Hamadryas, a genus of poisonous tree snakes* in 

 India, established by Dr. Cantor.f In our own venomous serpents, Elaps, Tri- 

 gonocephalus and Crotalus, the exterior row of teeth is wanting. In this re- 

 spect they resemble Dinophis, but the fang in the latter genus is, as above 

 stated, quite immovable. In one of the specimens a movable perforated fang 

 was observed on the right side behind the other immovable one. 



Dr. Edward Whitaker Gray, in the Philosophical Transactions of London for 

 1789, makes some interesting observations on the *' class of animals called by 

 Linnaeus, amphibia ; particularly on the means of distinguishing those serpents 

 Avhich are venomous from those which are not so." He arrives at the conclusion 

 that the only mode of distinguishing a venomous from a non-venomous serpent 

 is by an examination of their teeth ; the tail, which is usually short in the 

 venomous species, being sometimes short in the innocuous. This is the case 

 in Pityophis affinis, and melanoleucus, both harmless serpents, with very 

 short tails. Serpents whose appearance indicates inoffensiveness are not unfre- 

 quently very dangerous, as in the instance above cited, and in that of the genus 

 Sepedon of Merrem, and Distichurus maculatus, which is quite small, and resem- 

 bles in its general appearance an ordinary Coluber, but is provided with a small 

 isolated fang on each side of the upper jaw. One of these, I have been informed, 



* These poisonous tree snakes are probably more numerous in the East than 

 is generally supposed. Dr. Ruschenberger informs me that in Siam he observed 

 a large green tree snake, which was said by the natives to be very venomous.

killed a black womaa in Western Africa, death ensuing a short time after the 

 bite ; so that, as a general rule, it is best for travellers to avoid all serpents, un- 

 less they be naturalists and well acquainted with their structure and habits. In 

 Bucephalus, a genus established by Dr. Andrew Smith, found in S. Africa, the 

 posterior teeth are larger than the rest, and grooved upon their anterior and 

 convex surface, as is the case also in Dryophis and Dipsas. Bucephalus, accord- 

 ing to Dr. Smith, has six rows of teeth in the upper jaw, which is very re- 

 markable, most serpents having but four. In vol. iv. p. 39 of the Proceed- 

 ings of the Academy, mention is made by Dr. Savage of a wood sawyer having 

 been bitten by a green serpent, while in the act of preparing a log for the saw 

 probably one of the species above described. The wound was in the foot, which 

 was swollen, as was also the leg as high as the knee. Strong rum and Sulph. of 

 Morphia were administered, and a free incision was made over the wound. Pas- 

 sive hemorrhage ensuing, the vessels were taken up and tied; the whole limb 

 up to the groin became enormously swollen ; a bad sore followed the incision, 

 and the cuticle of the limb to a great extent came off. He recovered at the end 

 of three weeks. 



DENDROPHIS, Boie. 



Dendrophis plavigulaeis. 



Sp. Char. Head dark brown above, lighter upon the sides ; body and tail jet 

 black; thirteen rows of scales; total length 6 ft. 3 in. 10 lines. Abdominal 

 scuta 207 ; sub-caudal 146. 



Description. The head presents the form of a triangle truncated anteriorly, 

 depressed above posteriorly ; rostral plate pentangular, broader below than 

 above, rounded in front ; there are two nasal plates with the nostrils between 

 them ; the anterior nasal is very large ; there is a loral plate, also 

 large and more or less quadrangular in shape ; there is but one ant-ocular, 

 which is broad above, its upper surface extending inward between the posterior 

 frontal and the supra-ocular; there are three post-oculars, the two upper 

 of nearly equal size, the inferior long and slender ; there are two anterior and 

 two posterior frontals, the posterior rather larger than the anterior ; the 

 vertical is pentagonal, much broader anteriorly; the supra-oculars are 

 large, broad behind, narrow in front ; the occipitals are broad and short, 

 their transverse diameter being equal to their length ; there are two temporal 

 plates behind the posterior ocular, the posterior much larger than the anterior; 

 there are eight superior labials, the fourth and fifth forming part of the orbit, 

 the sixth and seventh are the largest ; the eyes are very large ; there are four 

 rows of teeth in the upper jaw ; nine plates margin the lower jaw on each side ; 

 the neck is contracted ; the body long and slender, thicker in the middle, covered 

 above with long and 'harrow carinated scales ; those nearest the abdomen are 

 shorter and broader than the rest ; tail covered with smooth imbricated scales, 

 broader than long. 



Color. Dark brown upon the upper part of the head, and upon the temples ; 

 lighter upon the sides ; chin and throat yellowish white ; neck yellowish white, 

 spotted with black ; body and tail jet black ; lighter upon the abdomen. 



Dimensions. Length of head 1 inch 4 lines ; greatest breadth 6 J lines ; length 

 of body 3 ft. .5 in. 2i lines ; length of tail 1 ft. 6 in. 8 lines ; greatest circum- 

 ference 2f inches. 



Habitat. Liberia, Western Africa. 



A specimen in the Museum of the Academy, presented by Dr. Henry A. Ford. 



Remarks. The animal above described has a general resemblance to the 

 Bucephalus capensis of Dr. Andrew Smith, and is of about the same length, 

 but differs in color. Bucephalus capensis, according to Dr. Smith, has six rows 

 of teeth.

 root ; femoral pores very distinct. 



Color. Head of the specimen examined of a light yellow color, with numer- 

 ous small brown spots disseminated upon its surface ; a dark colored bar upon 

 the temples, between the orbit and ear ; chin and throat marked with dark 

 colored lines and blotches ; body ash color above, presenting numerous small 

 points upon its surface, and marked with transverse bars of a vermilion color 

 during life ; upper surface of its extremities resembling in color that of the 

 abdomen, the thighs and more especially the legs marked with transverse bands 

 of vermilion ; abdomen flesh color ; tail ash, beautifully banded with trans- 

 verse bars of vermilion.

 male, forming part of Dr. Woodhouse's collection, differs from the Crotaphytus 

 Wislizenii of Baird and Girard, in the size and shape of the head: that of 

 Wislizenii being about a quarter of an inch longer ; the latter is also broader and 




208 [December, 



the snout less pointed ; the neck also in fasciatus is much more contracted, and 

 the body and both anterior and posterior extremities are much less robust. In 

 addition to these distinguishing characteristics, sufficient of themselves to sepa- 

 rate the two animals, there exist in fasciatus seven or eight narrow transverse 

 bands of a bright vermilion color upon the back, which are not observed in the 

 other species.

 nine plates ; of these the anterior frontal are pentangular, their posterior and 

 external angle being somewhat prolonged ; the posterior frontal are much 

 larger and irregularly quadrilateral ; the vertical is pentagonal, much 

 broader in front than posteriorly, its lateral margins being slightly hollowed ; 

 the supra-orbitar are oblong, pentagonal, broader behind than in front; the 

 occipital are very large, pentagonal : the rostral is broad and quadrilateral, 

 rounded above, excavated below ; the nostrils look upward and outward, and 

 are situated between two nasal plates ; there is one loral on each side which is 

 quadrilateral ; there are one anterior ocular and three posterior ocular plates ; 

 the former is quite large, and excavated anteriorly, so as to receive the 

 posterior margin of the loral ; there are two large temporal plates on each side 

 of the occipital; there are eight labials upon the margin of the upper jaw on 

 each side; of these the sixth and seventh are the largest ; the eyes are large and 

 projecting, the supraorbitars extending but slightly over the eye ; the 

 mental plate is small and triangular ; the anterior and posterior geneials are 

 quite long, the posterior somewhat more slender and larger than the anterior ; 

 the body is long, much thicker in the middle than at the extremities, covered 

 with twenty-three rows of strongly carinated scales ; the rows upon the sides 

 are much less strongly carinated than those upon the back ; the row nearest the 

 abdomen is the broadest. 



Color. Dusky olive upon the upper part of the head and back, becoming 

 darker upon the middle of the body, and toward the tail, presenting numerous 

 transverse dark colored bands, most distinct upon the posterior half of the body ; 

 these bands do not, as in Tropidonotus sipedon, extend as far as the abdomen; 

 they are bordered anteriorly and posteriorly with a strip of white ; chin, thorax 

 and neck straw color ; the abdominal scales are bordered anteriorly with black ; 

 tail, straw color, with indistinct bands of black along the borders of the scales. 



Dimensions. Length of head 1 inch 6 lines ; greatest breadth 9 lines ; length ; 

 of body 2 ft. 2 inches; of tail 5^ inches. Abdominal scuta 150; sub-caudal 44, 

 (tail broken off at extremity.) 



Habitat. Prairies near the Arkansas river. 



Remarks. The reptile above described resembles the Tropidonotus erythro- 

 gaster, in having the same number of rows of scales, there being 23 in each ; 

 and nearly the same number of abdominal plates, there being 148 in the erythro- 

 gaster and 149 in Woodhousii. The tail in the specimen of the latter species 

 having been mutilated, their number could not be accurately determined. The 

 coloration of the two animals, however, is very different, the white transverse 

 bands upon the back being very apparent in Woodhousii, but do not exist in 

 erythrogaster. They differ also greatly in size, Woodhousii being a much 

 smaller animal. Tropidonotus fasciatus has 140 abdominal plates and 42 pairs 

 of sub-caudal scales. The " body has singular oblong or triangular purplish 

 red spots on the flanks, which are insensibly lost about midway between the 

 abdomen and vertebral line." "In old animals the whole superior and lateral 

 surface becomes of a brownish color." Its circumference is five inches.

Ambystoma nebulosum. 



Sp. Char. Head as broad as long, rounded in front; palatine teeth in the form 

 of a triangle, the apex directed forward ; body brown with numerous yellow 

 spots ; tail longer than neek and body; total length 5 inches 9 lines. 



Description. The head is large, depressed above, about as broad as it is long ; 

 snout rounded ; nostrils small, about three lines apart ; eyes large and promi- 

 nent ; mouth very large ; tongue broad and flattened, free at its edges, attached 

 at its anterior border ; palatine teeth ..^^^"N^ shaped, the angle presenting for- 

 ward, the extremities of the row being placed a short distance behind the inter- 

 nal nares ; neck contracted ; posterior extremities stouter than the anterior ; 

 body sub-cylindrical, flattened inferiorly; tail longer than the head and body, 

 much more compressed, the posterior half especially, quite thin and rounded at 

 its extremity. 



Color. Head brownish above, with numerous indistinct yellowish spots pos- 

 teriorly : body blackish, presenting many yellowish spots upon the surface, the 

 largest about a line in diameter; extremities blackish, mingled with yellow ; 

 tail of some dark hue, with numerous yellow spots and markings ; chin, throat 

 and abdomen yellowish. 



Habitat. New Mexico. 



Dimensions. Length of head 8 lines ; greatest breadth 8 lines ; length of neck 

 and body 2 inches 2 lines ; of tail 2 inches 9 lines ; of anterior extremities 1 

 inch 6 lines ; of posterior the same ; total length 5 inches 9 lines. 



Another specimen from the same locality is more uniformly blackish upon the 

 upper surface, the yellowish spots being absent; the chin, throat and abdomen 

 are also more distinctly marked with black and yellow. 



Remarks. The above species differs from the Proserpine of Baird and Girard 

 in the shape of the head and in the coloring; and from Mavortia of Baird in 

 the same particulars. The Mavortia, according to Prof. Baird, has " about 

 nine broad transverse bands of yellowish on the sides of the body, confluent to 

 a certain extent with that of the belly." He describes similar markings upon 

 the tail, forming nearly complete ellipses, about twelve in number. The Ma- 

 vortia is eight inches in length. 



The Committee on the following paper by Dr. Genth, reported in 

 favor of publication in the Proceedings : 



On a probably new element with Iridosmine and Platinum, from California. 



By Dr. F. A. Genth. 



I received from Dr. Charles M. Wetherill a small quantity of white grains, 

 which were collected in 1849-50 from California gold by the late Jos. R. Rey- 

 nolds, Esq. An examination of these grains furnished me results which are, 

 perhaps, worth noticing. 



I. When treated with boiling hydrochloric acid, two grains began to dissolve 

 with disengagement of hydrogen. As soon as I observed this reaction I picked 

 them out and washed them oS" with water. With a good magnifying glass I 

 found that they were mechanically mixed with gold. Their color was between 

 a tin-white and steel color ; they were malleable, but harder than tin ; they dis- 

 solved in nitric acid, yielding a crystalline salt, the native gold which was mixed 

 with them remaining undissolved. They precipitated copper from solutions, but 

 slowly. Hydro-sulphuric acid precipitated the solution in nitric acid brown. A 

 pure piece of metal before the blowpipe on charcoal fused readily. It was 

 soon covered with a black oxide and gave no incrustations. Borax in the 0. 

 F. dissolved it and gave a colorless bead, which on cooling became opalescent ; 

 the same reaction took place more readily in R. F. 



The quanlity of this metal was too small for further experiment, but these re- 




210 [December, 



actions show that it is neither tin nor any other known element, although it has 

 some relations to tin, but it is distinguished from it 



1. By its solubility in nitric acid. 



2. By its brown precipitate with hydrosulphuric acid. 



3. By not being regularly oxydized before the blowpipe into a white 



Oxide, and by its other blowpipe-reactions. 

 May not the grains of native tin observed by Hermann in the auriferous sands 

 from Siberia be the same substance ? 



II. An examination of the white grains which were insoluble in hydrochloric 

 acidj gave (after a few scales of native gold had been extracted by quite diluted 

 aqua regia) the following results. 



Of 0-9366 grms. were 0-4625 grms. or 49-4 p. c. Sisserskite (Ir Os4 ) in 

 brilliant lead colored scales, some of which were imperfect six-sided prisms. 



The remaining grains and scales (0-4741 grms.) had a tin-white color, and 

 were treated with aqua regia, as long as it acted upon them. Three rounded 

 grains remained undissolved in aqua regia, which^ I suppose, were Platin-Iridium. 

 They weighed 0-0202 grs.=2-2 p. c. 



The balance of 0-4539 grms. or 48-4 p. c. were native Platinum. 

 The composition of the sample received by Dr. Chas. M. Wetherill was there- 

 fore New Element and gold not estimated. 



Sisserskite == 49-4 p. c. 



Platin-Iridium = 2-2 p. c. 



Native Platinum =48-4p. c. 



This native Platinum is not pure, but contains, like that from other localities, 

 other substances, both alloyed and mechanically mixed with it. 



When the 0.4539 grms. were dissolved in aqua regia, 0-0031 grms. or 0.68 p. c. 

 of Sisserskite remained undissolved in minute and fine scales. 



The solution was evaporated to dryness in a water-bath, dissolved in alcohol and 

 precipitated with chloride of ammonium. The brick-red double salt thus formed 

 was washed out with alcohol, then dried and powerfully healed. The ignited 

 residue weighed 0-4206 grms. It was treated with weak aqua regia, which left 

 undissolved O-OllO grms. of Iridium and Rhodium = 2-42 p. c. (This is of 

 course only an approximate estimation of Iridium, etc.) This presence of 

 Rhodium and Palladium was also ascertained, but I did not make any quantita- 

 tive estimations, because the quantity I had to dispose of was entirely too small 

 for the estimation of substances which can be separated only with the greatest 

 difficulty. 



The filtrate from the double salts of Platinum, etc., precipitated by ammonia 

 gave 0-0432 grms. of sexqui-oxide of iron = 6-66 p. c. of iron. 

 The composition of this native Platinum is therefore 



Platinum, (with Palladium) = 90-24 

 Iridium, (with Rhodium) = 2-42 

 Iron, = 6-66 



Sisserskite, = 0-68

The Committee on a paper by Dr. P. E. Hoy, *' On new Species of 

 Owls/' reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings. 



Description of two species of Owls, presumed to he new, which inhabit the State of 



Wisconsin. 

 By Philo R. Hoy, M. D., Racine, "Wisconsin. 

 1. Nyctale Kirtlandii, nobis. 

 The smallest described species of this genus. 



Male. Length 6}, ext. 10, tail extends to the tip of the folded wing. Head 

 and entire upper parts brown with a reddish gloss. Plumage around the base 

 of the tail and eyebrows white, immediately in front of the eye, intermingled 




1852.] 211 



with black bristles ; from the base of the lower mandible two short stripes of 

 white run downwards and backwards. Lores pitch black. Wings brown, infe- 

 rior wing coverts, and edge of wing at flexure, white ; primaries with three or four 

 narrow spots of silky white on their outer margins, and all the quills with circu- 

 lar spots of white on their inner webs. Tail brown, narrowly tipped with white 

 and crossed with two bands composed of spots of white, which are wanting on 

 the outer webs of the two lateral feathers. Throat and upper part of the breast 

 dark chesnut ; all the under parts bright reddish yellow, tarsi and toes thickly 

 covered with plumage of the same reddish yellow as the under parts. Bill and 

 claws black, irides golden yellow. 



But two specimens of this bird have been taken to my knowledge ; the first was 

 captured Oct., 1821, and kept until winter when it made its escape; the second, 

 and the one from which the above description was taken, flew into an open shop, 

 July, 1852. It is strictly nocturnal, utters a low tremulous note, and is an active 

 and efficient mouser. It is different from any other species yet known to inhabit 

 North America, and appears to have some general resemblance in color to N. 

 Harrisii, Cassin, but not sufficient to render it necessary to state their difference. 



I have named this species as a slight tribute of respect to that zealous Natu- 

 ralist, Prof. Jared P. Kirtland, of Cleveland, Ohio. 



2. Bubo subarcticus, nobis. 



A large light colored species. Tail crossed by five bands, wings with the third 

 primary longest, second shorter than the fourth, tooth or lobe of the upper man- 

 dible remarkably developed. 



Total length 24 inches, wing from flexure 17, tail 9|, and extends 3| beyond 

 the folded wings, tarsus 2J, bill over its convexity 1 5-12ths, egrets 3 inches. 



Above white and fawn color, zig-zagged and barred with brown, scapulars 

 broadly marked on their outer webs with white. Tail bright fawn, crossed by 

 five bars of brown, outer webs of the exterior and tips white, two central feathers 

 colored similar to the back. Quills with seven bars of brown. 



Beneath white ; on the breast, sides, and flanks, each feather crossed with bars 

 and narrow stripes of deep brown, forming on the breast a wide irregular band 

 of the latter color. Lower tail coverts white, each feather with a single narrow 

 band of brown. 



Face groyish white, lores tipped with black, egrets with their outer webs and 

 tips black, inner webs white, bill dark horn color, lighter at the point, claws 

 black, irides yellow. 



The specimen now described was shot in January, 1851, near this city, and 

 proved to be a female. I have seen two others which were precisely similar in 

 their markings to the present. This species does not agree in many essential 

 points with Richardson's description of the Arctic horned Owl, nor dees it agree 

 either in color or anatomically with the common great horned owl, which is 

 very abundant here, and of which I have kept living specimens for more than a 

 year. Of the latter species I have seen some very dark colored specimens, which 

 are mostly, but not invariably, male birds. 



Some of my reasons for considering the bird just described as distinct from the 

 common species, are as follows : It differs, 1. In color and markings. 2. In 

 measurements; it has comparatively greater length of tail, and of wings. Ana- 

 tomically; the cranium of a specimen in my possession, shows a greater devel- 

 opment of the posterior lobes of the brain and other differences, and a more dis- 

 tinct tooth-like lobe of the upper mandible. 4. I have seen three specimens all 

 corresponding in every particular, and all occurring only in the depth of winter, 

 when the great Cinereous Owl, {Syrnium cinereum,) the Hawk Owl, {Surnia 

 funerea.^ and the Snowy Owl, (o. nyctea^) were with us. My conclusion is, 

 therefore, that it is like these species, an inhabitant of the Arctic regions of this 

 continent, and one of the rarest of the winter visitants in the northern parts of 

 the United States, and in Wisconsin is much less common than either of the 

 three species mentioned. 



The Committee to which had been referred Dr. WetherilFs paper 

 entitled " An Analysis of the Cotton Plant and Seed/' &c.; reported in 




212 [December, 



favor of the publication of the following abstract of the same in the 



proceedings : 



Analysis of the Cotton Plant and Seed. 



By the late Thomas J. Summer, Esq. of South Carolina. Communicated by Dr* 



Charles M. Wetherill. 



In a communication on the analysis of the ash of a cotton stalk by Mr. Judd} 

 in the Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 

 p. 219, surprise is expressed at the absence of published analyses of the 

 cotton plant, with the exception of one of the wood and another of the seed, 

 by Prof. Shepard. I owe it to the memory of my friend and classmate in 

 Giessen,the late Thomas J. Summer, Esq., to communicate the following analy- 

 tical results arrived at by him while in the Giessen laboratory, and which have 

 not been published, that I am aware of, except in pamphlet form for circulation 

 among his friends : 



Analysis of the Ash of the Cotton Plant. 

 The analysis was carried on in the usual manner 6.181 grammes were di- 

 gested with muriatic acid, and evaporated to dryness by the water bath. After 

 moistening with acid and adding water, the insoluble portion was separated, 

 which consisted of 0-621 sand and coal, and 0-403 silicia. The filtrate was di- 

 vided into three equal parts. In the first, the iron, in combination with phos- 

 phoric acid, lime and magnesia, was determined. In the second, sulphuric and 

 phosphoric acids. In the third, the alkalies. 

 The following are the per centage results :

The Ash of the Seed. 



The seeds were burned in a mufile ; only a slight red heat was necessary to 

 burn them perfectly white. 



For estimating the amount of water 6.406 grammes of seed, dried at 212, 

 lost 0-G4G, or ten per cent, water ; 6.587 of the dried seed left by incineration 

 in a platinum crucible, 0.237, or 3-6 per cent. ash. The qualitative analysis 

 showed the same constituents as in the ash of the plant, with the exception of 

 carbonic acid. The following are the analytical results :

An inspection of the above analysis of the cotton seed shows that it abounds 

 in the phosphates and alkalies. Drs. Will and Fresenius, in their analysis of 

 the cereal grains, show that wheat also abounds largely in these constituents. 

 The following analysis, as above quoted, will enable the comparison to be 

 made: 



Red Wheat. White Wheat. 



100.00 100.00 



These constituents being derived directly from the soil, plainly indicate the 

 reasons why the land in the South is so readily exhausted. The crops extensively 

 cultivated there, all require, in a great measure, the same food from the soil ; 

 and hence, soils which will not produce cotton are alike incapable of producing 

 the cereal crops. The great benefit derived from the application of cotton seed 

 as a manure, to these crops, is accounted for from the same causes, in their 

 abundance of alkalies and phosphates. In connection with the assimilation of 

 alkaline phosphates by plants, the experiments of Dumas on the solution of 

 bones by water charged with carbonic acid, as detailed in a memoir " on the 

 manner in which phosphate of lime enters organized beings," (Comptes Rendus, 

 Nov. 30, 1846,) are interesting. He remarks that the phosphate of lime, though 

 insoluble in water, nevertheless penetrates through bones, and is deposited in 

 their structure, and that, on the other hand, bones are slowly disaggregated by 

 the soil and disappear after a time. This is owing, according to Dumas, to two 

 causes, the one, sal-ammoniac acting rarely and feebly, the other, carbonic acid, 

 acting constantly and rapidly. Plates of ivory introduced by Dumas into bot- 

 tles of Seltzer water, were as much softened after twenty-four hours as if they 

 had been acted on by dilute muriatic acid ; and the Seltzer water was found 

 loaded with phosphate of lime. I would call attention to this property of car- 

 bonic acid as satisfactorily explaining the assimilation of the phosphate of lime 

 by plants. The carbonic acid given off in the fermentation of the manure 

 greatly facilitates the solution of phosphate of lime when present as 

 bone ash. 



It was a matter of surprise to Prof. Liebig that soils not furnished artifi- 

 cially with the preponderating constituents of the cotton plant and seed, should 

 produce a crop abounding in the phosphates. This leads me to further investi- 

 gation, and a rich field of research lies still unexplored in the analytical exam- 

 ination of the cotton soils of the South and West. 



Thomas J. Summer. 



South Carolina^ 1848. 



It is indeed a matter of surprise that an article of such world-wide necessity 

 should have been hitherto so neglected by agricultural chemists, and indeed I 

 am not aware that we have even now an analysis in full of the ash of the whole 

 plant. The two best analyses are those of the stalk by Summer and Judd. The 

 analysis of the seed by Summer contains an error of loss and Chlorine = 4.84 

 p. c. The same analysis (of seed) by Shepard, gives an error of 1.68 p. c. of 

 loss. Carbonate of potassa. Sulphates of Lime and Magnesia, Alumina and 

 Sesquioxide of Iron ; and Shepard's analyses are calculated with regard to the 

 composition of the ash itself, instead of giving the constituents separately, 

 which alone renders a comparison between different analyses possible, the com- 

 position of ash varying according to the nature and quantity of its constituents, 

 and the degree of heat at which it is prepared. I have recalculated Summer's 



33 




214 



[December, 



analysis of the stalk by Weber's new analytical Tables ; want of data in the 

 seed analysis rendered its recalculation impossible. I have also recalculated 

 Summer's analysis to the hundred parts, neglecting Sand, Coal and Silica ; and 

 having separated the salts in Shepard's analysis, I recalculated the constituents 

 in the same manner. The following table will show the comparative nature of 

 the constituents of the ash of the plant, seed and wool, as analysed by Shepard, 

 Summer and Judd ; the defective analyses above mentioned considered as 

 approximative :

Of the above, 57 have been received from Authors, 34 from Editors, 90 from 

 Societies, Corporations, &c., 834 from D. T. B. Wilson, 1767 from Edward 

 Wilson, Esq., 98 from other Members and Correspondents, and from miscella- 

 neous sources, and 6 from the U. S. Government ; making a total of 2886 addi- 

 tions to the Library in 1852. 



From our fellow-member, Mr. Elias Durand, we have also received 109 auto- 

 graphs of distinguished scientific and literary men. 



The excess in the increase of volumes this year over that of the last is 631. 

 In 1851, the Library was increased 1075 volumes; in 1850, 1719 volumes; in 

 1849, 789 volumes ; in 1848, 652 volumes ; and in 1847, 630 volumes ; making a 

 total increase in six years of 6571. Many periodicals, also, in course of publi- 

 tion during these years, and recorded as such in our lists of donations to the 

 Library, have since been bound into volumes, the number of which may be esti- 

 mated at about 700 ; and added to the above give a total of nearly 7300 volumes 

 contributed to the Society's Library in that short period. 



In the report submitted to the Academy in December, 1850, the number ot 

 volumes in the Library at that time, as ascertained by actual enumeration, was 

 12,057. If to these be added those since received, with the proportion of 




1852.] 217 



volumes of periodicals bound in that time, the number on our shelves at present 

 exceeds 15,000. 



Nearly all the additions in the six years above referred to, have been gifts 

 from individuals or Societies, or in exchange for our own publications, very 

 little money having been expended. 



The rich and costly collection which surrounds us, like that in our noble 

 Museum, affording instruction and delight not to ourselves alone, but to nume- 

 rous inquirers after knowledge beyond our own limits, is therefore made up 

 almost entirely of spontaneous offerings, prompted by disinterested generosity 

 or a love for science. Let us not lose sight of this fact ; it cannot be too often 

 referred to, or too strongly impressed upon us. Every means in our power should 

 be employed to protect such valuable trusts from abuse and loss. The plausible 

 pretender to science, the inconsiderate idler and the pilferer, should find no 

 encouragement within these walls. 



The present accommodations for the books have become too limited to admit 

 of their proper arrangement, or of easy access to them. For the last few 

 months inconvenience has been experienced to an annoying extent from some 

 of the cases being crowded to excess. Many plans have been suggested with 

 a view to remedy this evil, all of which, however, were of too temporary a 

 character to admit of adoption. 



It is now, however, proposed to remove to the Hall above, as soon as appro- 

 priate places can be prepared for them, the entire collections in Mineralogy, 

 Conchology, Herpetology, &c., at present contained in the basement apartment 

 adjoining the Library, and to convert the latter into a library room. The area 

 of this apartment is nearly equal to that now occupied for library purposes, and 

 may be estimated to be sufficient to accommodate at least 10,000 additional 

 volumes. The basement of the building would then, with the exception of one 

 room, (which must be retained for the reception and unpacking of parcels, boxes, 

 &c.,) be occupied by the library, and the great advantage gained, which has 

 been so long desired, of keeping it isolated or distinct from the Museum. 



The statement above presented is in every respect gratifying, and the Society 

 may be congratulated, as on every occasion like the present for the last few 

 years, on the rapid and steady advancement in this department the most 

 important, perhaps, in the Institution affording the best evidence of the favor 

 in which the latter is everywhere held, and the unceasing liberality of its 

 friends and supporters. The Academy of Natural Sciences may justly boast 

 that in this age of progress it has not been left behind. It is, and has been, 

 since its origin, with few exceptions, progressive ; partly owing, doubtless, to 

 its intrinsic merit, but mainly to a succession of advantageous circumstances 

 operating in its favor. Its benefactors have been open-handed to an extent 

 heretofore unknown in institutions of this nature in our country. The names 

 of Maclure and Wilson, especially, will never be mentioned without regard and 

 admiration. Through their instrumentality, in a great measure, the Institution 

 now rests upon a firm and solid basis ; its endurance will depend not merely 

 upon the intelligence, zeal and industry of those who succeed us here, but also 

 upon a proper appreciation by them of the true and legitimate objects of its 

 founders. No misgivings, however, need be entertained on this head. At no 

 period in its history have the prospects been more encouraging than at present, 

 of its high scientific reputation being fully maintained, and of its utility and 

 advantages to the community being generally recognised as a great centre for 

 the increase of knowledge.

Hall of tht Academy^ Dec. 28, 1852. 



The Annual Report of the Treasurer was read and referred to the 

 Auditors. 




218 [December, 



The report of the Curators was then read, as follows ; 



REPORT OF THE CURATORS FOR 1852. 



Since the last annual report of the Curators was presented to the Academy, 

 very considerable additions have been made to its Museum, which, we are happy 

 to state, continues in a good state of preservation. Latterly the Cabinet has 

 sustained several losses by the abstraction of valuable specimens, but the circum- 

 stance having excited the attention of the Curators, means have been resorted 

 to, which we hope will prevent further depredation. 



During the year, the different departments of the Museum have received the 

 following donations : 



Mammalia. Of this class there have been presented the skins of 35 specimens 

 of 25 species, principally from Dr. D. Leasure, Drs. A. L. Heermann, E. K. Kane, 

 J. L. Le Conte, S. W. Woodhouse, Mr. J. D. Sergeant and Col. G. A. McCall. 



Aves. Of bird-skins 94 specimens of about 60 species have been received. 

 The principal donors are Drs. H. G. Dalton, E. K. Kane, A. A. Henderson, T. 

 Carlton Henry, W. S. "W. Ruschenberger, Messrs. E. H. Kern, J. D. Sergeant, G, 

 N. Lawrence, J. Lambert, G. A. McCall. Part of the number formed the collec- 

 tion made in Lieut. Lynch's Expedition to the Dead Sea, and was presented by 

 order of the Secretary of the Navy. 



Besides the above, numerous species have been deposited by Dr. Wilson, of 

 which no official record has been given to the Curators. 



Of birds' eggs, a large number of specimens of about 40 species, have been 

 presented by Messrs. John Krider, E. Wilson, and A. L. Heermann. 



Reptilia. Of this class 100 specimens have been presented, chiefly by Messrs. 

 H. A. Ford, A. L. Heermann, G. Watson, B. F. Shumard, J. Le Conte, G. W. 

 Fahnestock, G. A. McCall, J. Krider and E. Harris. The species are from 

 different parts of the world, and a number of them from Africa and the 

 western part of Nerth America, are new, and have been recently described in 

 the Proceedings of the Academy by Dr. Hallowell. 



Pisces. Of fishes 58 specimens of 35 species have been presented by Messrs. 

 G. W. Fahnestock, Edw. Wilson, A. A. Henderson, E. Harris, J. Le Conte and 

 T. Conrad. Among the number are several specimens of the curious Branchi- 

 ostoma. 



Mollusca. In this department the Cabinet has received an addition of 

 numerous specimens of 80 species of shells, chiefly from Messrs. Edw. Wilson, 

 S. Handy, J. Krider and J. L. Burtt. 



Crustacea. In this department we have reaped a rich harvest. 



190 specimens of 54 species of British Crustacea were presented by Edward 

 Wilson, Esq. 



282 species of 136 genera, from the collection of M. Guerin Meneville, have 

 been received from Dr. T. B. Wilson. This collection is particularly valuable, 

 on account of the great number of minute and rare species from all parts of the 

 globe, which it contains. 



Besides the above, M. J. Verreaux, of Paris, has presented 36 specimens 

 of 14 species, and 112 specimens of about 50 species were received from 

 Messrs. Edw. Wilson, S. Ashmead, J. Le Conte, and others. 



Insecta. 600 specimens of the various orders of insects have been presented 

 principally by Messrs. A. L. Heermann, H. G. Dalton, S. S. Haldeman. 



Arachnida, Annelida and Myriapoda. Of these 49 species have been received 

 from Messrs. Edward Wilson, R. H. Kern, R. E. Peterson, and others. 



Zoophyta. 178 specimens have been presented by Messrs. Edward Wilson, 

 T. B. Wilson, W. S. W. Ruschenberger, F. S. Holmes, and others. 



Comparative Anatomy. A magnificent skeleton of the Troglodytes gorilla, 

 Savage^ was presented by Dr. Henry A. Ford, of Liberia, and a specimen 




1852.] 219 



believed to be unique, of the skeleton of Chcerodes Liberiensis, Lddy^ has been 

 received from Dr. T. B. Wilson. 



Besides the foregoing, 49 crania of mammals, birds and reptiles, 17 skeletons 

 of birds, and 58 miscellaneous specimens have been presented by Messrs. J. Ver- 

 reaux, De la Berge, A. L. Heermann, G. P. Oliver, B. H. Coates, Amory Edwards, 

 "W. Wood, A. Janney, and others. 



Botany. The herbarium has been increased by the addition of a number of 

 valuable specimens. 



Major J. Le Conte presented his entire collection of North American plants, 

 made through the course of many years. 



Other collections of Phaenerogamous plants have been presented by the Rev. 

 M. A. Curtis, of South Carolina, Dr. A. L. Heermann, Mr. R. H. Kern, and 

 Dr. Engelmann, of St. Louis. 



Of fruits, lichens, marine algae, &c. we have received 96 specimens from 

 Messrs. S. Ashmead, G. W. Fahnestock, J. C. Trautwine, E. K. Kane, and 

 others. 



PalcBontology . An interesting collection of minute crag fossils of England , 

 consisting of 41 species, was presented by Dr. T. B. Wilson. 



Dr. J. L. LeConte has presented the unique fossils upon which were esta- 

 blished the Dicotyles depressifrons, D. cristatus, Procyon priscus, Protochcerus 

 prismaticus, and Anomodon Snyderi. 



Dr. Isaac Hays presented an interesting specimen, upon which has been pro- 

 posed the Tapirus Haysii. 



Besides the above, 219 specimens of organic remains have been presented by 

 Messrs. D. D. Owen, Thomas Fisher, A. Jessup, R. Kilvington, C. Wistar, C. 

 H. Budd, J. L. Burtt, Leidy, Wetherill, H. W. Kennedy, Spackman, and others. 



Mineralogy . 83 specimens of minerals have been presented by Messrs. W. 

 D. Hartmann, S. Ashmead, W. S. Vaux, T. Fisher, G. M. Wheatley and J. L. 

 Burtt. Among the specimens is a beautiful piece of crystalline native copper, 

 one and a half feet in length, from Lake Superior, the donor of which is Mr. 

 B. A. Hoopes. 



In conclusion, the Curators respectfully call upon the members to co-operate 

 in the endeavors now being made to raise a fund sufificient to increase the capa- 

 city of the Museum to an extent demanded by its collections ; and they hope, 

 at the next annual meeting, to be able to report that ample space has been pro- 

 vided for the accommodation of any future additions to the Cabinet. 



Joseph Leidy, Chairman of the Curators. 



The Committee on Proceedings presented the following 



REPORT: 



The " Proceedings" of the Academy, the publication of which was commenced, 

 more than ten years since, has increased gradually in importance, and now 

 commands respect abroad, from the value and diversity of its contents. It is 

 quoted by kindred journals, and seems to be regarded as authority. 



The members of the Academy are respectfully invited to consider the value 

 of this publication. 



To make widely known the labors of the members of the Academy is, in its 

 influence on the prosperity of the Institution, and on the increase of knowledge, 

 second only to those labors themselves. Discoveries in natural history art- 

 valuable in proportion to the number of persons to whom they may be made 

 known. While a knowledge of new facts is limited to the discoverer and his 

 companions, science gains little and society is scarcely benefited by the toils of 

 research. It is not necessary to enlarge on this point ; every one is aware that 




320 [December, 



while sight and hearing place external things in relation with us, it is voice 

 which places us in relation with external things. 



The Journal of the Proceedings, and the Journal of the Academy, are the 

 vocal organs, the voice of the Institution, through the medium of which all the 

 facts it acquires, and all the opinions it forms, are promulgated. These publi- 

 cations are a sure means of making known the results ef our investigations and 

 studies, and, consequently, our existence as a corporate body. Through them 

 alone the Academy is placed in communication with analogous Institutions at 

 distant points of our own country and in foreign lands. To these publications 

 the Academy is indebted for its reputation, a wide-spread appreciation of its 

 importance, and also for much of what is contained in the Library and in the 

 Museum. 



While we refer with satisfaction to the quantity and quality of information 

 placed on record and printed in the Proceedings, and may be excused, perhaps, 

 for believing that this journal is not surpassed, if equalled, by any similar 

 publication in the United States, it may be well to disclose the fact that it does 

 not receive^ even from members of the Academy, all the substantial support 

 and encouragement which are necessary to its prosperity. 



When it is known that the subscription price of a copy of the Proceedings 

 for one year is only one dollar, it is hoped this statement will be sufficient to 

 cause every member to contribute towards diminishing the charge upon the 

 Treasury, by becoming a subscriber himself, and by inducing others to subscribe 

 whenever proper opportunity offers. 



The whole is submitted on behalf of the Committee on Proceedings, 



W. S. W. RUSCHENBEEQEE, 



Hall of the Academy^ Dec. 28, 1852. 



Dr. Fisher, from the Committee on Mammalogy, reported that 123 

 skins of mammalia had been mounted and added to the collection, 

 at an expense of $289, which had been defrayed by the following 

 named members : Edward Harris, J. Price Wetherill, Charles D. 

 Meigs, John K. Mitchell, George W. Carpenter, William S. Vaux, 

 Joseph Carson, Jos. Pancoast, P. B. Goddard, Robert Pearsall, Wm. E.

 B. H. Ooates, Samuel Ashmead, B. E. Peterson, R. Bridges, Jas. C. 

 Fisher. 



Dr. Woodhouse requested that the following correction be published 

 in the Proceedings : 



Having discovered that the specific name dorsalis, which I applied to 

 the squirrel brought by me from New Mexico, and which I described in 

 the Proceedings of the Academy for June last (page 110,) has already 

 been applied by J. E. Gray to one of the same genus, I propose now 

 to call it SciURUS Aberti, after Colonel J. J. Abert, chief of the corps 

 of Topographical Engineers, U. S. Army, to whose exertions science is 

 much indebted.

A letter was read from the Hon. J. P. Kennedy, Secretary of the 

 Navy, dated Navy Department, Washington, Dec. 25th, 1852, acknow- 

 ledging the receipt of a copy of the Preamble and Kesolutions adopted 

 by the Academy on the l-lth of that mouth, approving the recom- 

 mendations and suggestions contained in his recent report to the Presi- 

 dent, and his efforts for 'Hhe encouragement of missions tending to pro- 

 mote scientific researches in our own and other countries.'' 



The Secretary also expresses to the Academy " his peculiar pleasure 

 in taking advantage of the opportunity to signalize, by an official com- 

 mendation, the meritorious labors of tlieir fellow member Dr. Kane, and 

 to enable him, with such aid as he could bestow, once more to embark 

 upon a sea of adventure, in which his philanthropy and love of science 

 have already won him equal and imperishable honor : and also trusted, 

 that with the support of the Academy, and the countenance of the Go- 

 vernment, he would return, after his second Expedition to the Arctic 

 Circle, with new claims to the congratulations of his friends, and the 

 applause of his country."

 of the Committee to give their assistance in any plan for forwarding the 

 objects of the Expedition, which the Acadenjy might think proper to 

 suggest. Keferred to the Committee previously appointed on this sub- 

 ject. 



Dr. Le Conte read a paper intended for publication in the Proceedings 

 of the Academy, entitled " Descriptions of twenty new species of Cole- 

 optera inhabiting the United States j" which was referred to Dr. Zant- 

 zinger. Dr. Pickering and Dr. Leidy. 



Dr. Woodhouse presented a paper for publication in the Proceedings, 



PttOCEED. ACAD. NAT. SCI. OF PHILADELPHIA. VOL. VI. NO. VII. 36 




224 [January, 



describing a new species of pouched Eat, of the genus Dipodomys, Gray; 

 which was referred to Dr. Bridges, Dr. Le Conte and Mr. Cassin. 



Dr. Le Conte offered some remarks on the genus Dipodomys, and stated that 

 he had recently been investigating the specimens of that interesting genus in 

 the Collection of the Academy, and had come to the conclusion that it contained 

 several species besides those already known. The fortunate arrival of an un- 

 doubted specimen of D. Phillipii (Gray) from California, and which, by the 

 liberality of Dr. Heermann, is now in the possession of the Academy, has 

 enabled him to complete the study of this genus, and the results will soon be 

 made known to the Academy in a monograph, now in preparation by himself, 

 on the North American Myoxina. 



He exhibited to the members five species of Dipodomys, and pointed out their 

 specific characters, which are to be found in the length and color of the tail, and 

 in the form of the antitragus of the ears. In other respects, both in form and 

 color, the species resemble each other very closely. These differences, he 

 stated, could not be the result of age, as the specimens, with one exception, 

 were full grown; he stated, moreover, that the specific differences were similar 

 to those found in the genus Myoxus, tpw'hich, by the form of the scull, and by 

 the absence of the postorbital process, the genera Dipodomys and Perognathus 

 show the closest resemblance. With the group of Dipoda, in which the former 

 genus is placed by European systematists, these genera have no relation. The 

 five species known to him may be thus grouped. 



A. Tail much longer than the head and body, furnished towards the tip with 

 a brush of long hairs ; antitragus short, broad and very distinct. 



1. D. Phillipii Gray, Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist. 7,522: Audubon, 

 Quadr. of America, pi. 130: Wagner, Schreber's Saiigeth: Suppl. 3, 295. Schintz, 

 Syn. Mam. 2, 93. 



Tail brown, with a whitish vitta each side; outer third dark blackish brown ; 

 tip pure white. Sacramento Valley; Dr. Heermann. 



2. D. agilis Gambel, Proceedings Acad. Nat. Sc, 4, 77. 



Tail brownish, with an indistinct whitish vitta each side ; outer third to tip 

 nearly uniform pale brown. San Diego ; Dr. John L. Le Conte. 



B. Tail as long as the head and body ; hair at the tip scarcely longer ; anti- 

 tragus very short, indistinct. 



3. D. Heermanni. Tail brown, becoming black towards the extremity, 

 with a broad white vitta each side ; tip pure black. Sierra Nevada; Dr. Heer- 

 mann. (Specimen not quite adult.) 



C. Tail shorter than the body ; hairs on the outer third very long ; ears mode- 

 rately small ; antitragus obsolete. 



4. D. Ordii Woodhouse. Tail brownish, with a broad white vitta each 

 side ; long terminal hairs pale brown, white at the base. El Paso, Texas ; Dr. 

 Woodhouse. 



Of the fifth species there is a single specimen labelled " James Read, South 

 Carolina ;" this locality seems doubtful, as all the other species are from the 

 western part of the continent. It seems to belong to the first division, although, 

 as the outer portion of the tail is wanting, we cannot be certain of that fact. 

 The length, however, of the individual caudal vertebrae, indicates a tail similar 

 to that of D. agilis, with which it agrees in color. The ears are somewhat 

 larger than in that species, and the antitragus is large, broad and obtusely 

 rounded at its summit. For this species the name D. Wa gner i is proposed. 



Of Perognathus there are now three species known. 



1. P. fasciatus Wied, Nova Act. Leopold Car. Acad. 19, 369, tab. 34 ; 

 Wagner, Schreber's Saugeth. Suppl., 3,G12; Schintz, Syn. Mam., 2, 259. Mis-

3. P. parvus Lee. Cricetodipus parvus Peale. U. S. Exp. Exp. Mam., 

 p. 5Z, pi. 13, fig. 2. 



A specimen procured by me in the Desert of the Colorado of Southern Cali- 

 fornia, differs only from Peale's original specimen from Oregon in having the 

 whiskers partly black; it is apparently a more adult specimen, thouirh not 

 larger than the one in the Exp. Exp. Collection. An error occurs in Peale's 

 description and measurement, where the tail is stated to be longer than the body; 

 it is in reality a little shorter than the head and body, reaching just in front of 

 the ears, when laid along the back. 



Dr. Charles M. "Wetherill presented to the notice of the Society speci- 

 mens of fused Asphalte from Hillsboro', New Brunswick, which variety 

 of Asphalte lie had characterized as Melan- Asphalt, in a paper read be- 

 fore the American Philosophical Society in July last. Dr. W. remarked 

 that Chemists, who had pronounced this variety of Asphalt infusible, 

 had not properly experimented with it. He had recently fused it in a 

 Grerman flask ; it flowed with a level surface and was poured out, after 

 which it hardened. It is remarkably electric both before and after 

 fusion.

Descriptions of Tivoity new .species of Cohoptera itihahiting the Uuiled States. 



By John L. Le Conte, M. D. 



The following; are a few remarkable species of families which are so small as 

 not to be of sufficient importance for a special essay, or else they belong to 

 groups which, having already furnished material for synopses or monographs, 

 are not sufficiently increased to need revision. Some new genera are proposed, 

 the affinities of which, so far as made out, will be detailed below ; the names of 

 the families to which the new genera belong are appended to each. Species in- 

 dicated from the Mexican Boundary, were collected by Mr. J. H. Clark, under 

 Col. J. D. Graham, and were kindly communicated to me by my friend Dr. S. F. 

 Baird. 



Amsomera Brulle. (Dytiscidre.) 



Palpi cylindrici, labiales articulo penultimo lon^iore; prosternum non com- 

 presso carinatum, postice productum ; tarsi anteriores filiformes articulo ultimo 

 elongato, postici parce ciliati, articulis Imo 5toque elongatis, unguiculis binis 

 aqualibus mobilibus. 



Having several specimens of a species of this interesting genus from New 

 Mexico, I am able to complete the description of Brulle and Aube, which Avere 

 taken from a specimen deprived of its posterior feet. These organs are slender; 

 the tibice are slightly ciliated internally with long hairs, and armrd at the tip 

 with two slender, subequal spurs ; the posterior tarsi are not longer than the 

 tibiae, slightly compressed and sparsely ciliated ; the first joint is as long as the 

 second and third ; the 2d, od and 4th are nearly equal ; the 5th is a little shorter 

 than the 3d and 4th, not narrowed towards the extremity ; the claws are equal 

 and moveable In the male, the first three joints of the anterior and middle 

 tarsi are sl'ghtly dilated, and furnished beneath with feathery papillae, very 

 much as in Platynus. The posterior tibiae of the female are scarcely ciliate. 



This genus appears quite as closely allied to Agabus and Copelatus as they 

 are to each oth^r. The form of the thorax would indicate, however, that it 

 must be rec^-ived as a distinct genus, but the characters, on close examination, 

 appear to be of little value ; the bfst differences are found in the elongation of 

 the last joint of the anterior and middle tarsi, the smaller size of the spurs of 

 the posterior tibiae, and the more regular form of the posterior tarsi, which are 

 not attenuated at the apex. The middle lobe of the mentum in the species here 

 described is broad, short, and very obsoletely sinuated, while the mentum of 

 Anisomera is described as having the middle lobe slightly prominent in the 

 middle; this character must be re-examined with other specimens, as, if it be 

 correctly described, the present species cannot be associated with the type of 

 the genus; the prosternum is less compressed than in Copelatus. Agabus is 

 described as having the prosternum strongly compressed and carinate ; this 

 structure is found in A. t a n i a t u s Anhc, and many others, but is hardly to be 

 observed in A. s t r i at u s yl/^/;f. I would also observe that Agabus a n- 

 g u st u s Lee. (Agassiz. Lake Sup., 213) by having the thorax much rounded 

 before, and nearly parallel behind the middle, shows a tendency towards the 

 peculiar form seen in Anisomera. 



A. cordata, supra aeneo-picca, elongato-ovalis, depressa, subtilissime re- 

 ticulata, thorace brevi, postice angustato, et lateribus sinuato, elytris thorace 

 vix latioribus, postice non dilatatis ; subtus nigra, ore antennis pedibusque ru- 

 bro-piceis. Long -45. 



Santa Fe, New Mexico. Mr. Fcndler. Varies, with black feet ; the sides of the 

 thorax are strongly rounded in front, and subsinuate behind ; the base is as 

 wide as the ap^x, the anterior dilatation being produced by the curvature of the 

 sides ; the anterior angles are acute, the posteridr angles rectangular. The 

 elytra are very little wider than the widest part of the thorax, regularly elongate, 

 eiiqitical, with the usual series of punctures becoming irregular towards the tip. 




IS^o.] 227 



Amthizoa Lee. (Fam. nova ?) 



Pedes ambulatorii, tarsi pentameri, articulo ultimo valde elongato ; antennae 

 11-articulatae, liliforines, glabrae; palpi breve-; cylindrici ; maxillae lobo interiore 

 arcuato acnto, e.vteriore biarticulato, palpifornii ; prosternum postice productum, 

 obtusu.r;; coxoej anticE et interriiinliae parv;e, olobosae, postica? transversae ad mar- 

 ginem corporis extensnp ; abdomen t>-articulatum, articulis 3 primis connatis. 



After repeated comparisons v^'ith };enera of all the families to which this in- 

 sect seems allied, it has been found impossible to place it in any of the pre- 

 viously established irrouj)s. A full discussion of the comparative value of the 

 characters ottered by it, would involve an examination of the fundamental prin- 

 ciples of clas>i(icarion of the terrestrial and aquatic predacious beetles ; the ma- 

 terial for such a discussion is not yet available in this country, and it must 

 therefore be postponed to a future occasion. For the present, a few observations, 

 on some heretofore nesilected relations existing between those families, will be 

 sufficient to indicate the position of Amphizoa. 



A large series of penramerous, carniverous Coleoptera, may be characterized 

 as having the antenna? neither clavate nor lamellate, but usually filiform, and 

 the prothorax with distinct epimera and episterna ; the anterior coxce small, not 

 prominent, usually globular ; the trochanters always simple ; the anterior seg- 

 ments of the abdomen connate. This series may be divided into two great groups. 



I. In the first the anterior coxae are contained in the prosternum alone ; the 

 posterior coxe do not extend to the margin of the body, so that the first ventral 

 segment of the abdomen reaches the parapleural, and articulates with them. 

 (The antennae are always regular, the basal joints glabrous, the outer ones 

 pubescent; the anterior coxae always globular.) This group consists of the 

 Cicindelidae and Carabidae. 



II. In the second, the anterior coxae are received between the pro and mesos- 

 ternum, the posterior portion of the acetabulum being composed of the latter; 

 the posterior coxae extend to the margin of the body, so that the connection 

 between the parapleurae and first ventral segment of the abdomen is entirely 

 cut off. 'I'his group u composed of the aquatic families Haliplidae, Dytiscidae, 

 and Gyrinidae. 



Recurring now to the second group, it will be found that Amphizoa agrees 

 with it in the glabrous antennae, and in the form of the head, labrum, maxillae 

 and m^ntum ; the latter is large, deeply emarginate, with the lateral lobes 

 rounded; in the middle of the emargination is a broad, short, blunt tooth. The 

 ligula is large, filling the emargination of the chin, truncate at tip, and promi- 

 nent along the middle and appx, so as to present a form like the letter T. The 

 maxillae are of the ordinary form seen in Carabidae, but the inner lobe is not 

 ciliated. The prosternum is not elevated, it is not lobed in front, but poste- 

 riorly is produced in an obtuse spatula-like process, fitting into the mesoster- 

 num. which is excavated through its entire length; the anterior coxae are mode- 

 rately distant, small and round. The episterna are divided by an oblique suture 

 from the humerus to the middle coxae. The parapleurae are slightly triangular, 

 not appendiculate, and entirely separated from the ventral portion of the abdo- 

 men by the posterior coxre, which are transverse, flat externally, slightly 

 elevated and diverging at the insertion of the leg, as in Carabidae ; the diverg- 

 ing lobes are obtusely rounded, but not so much elevated as to allow the freedom 

 of motion observed in Dytiscidae. The legs are not at all compressed ; the femora 

 and tibiae are slender and finely scabrous, with elevated points, the terminal 

 spurs of the tibiae are small ; the tarsi are three-fourths as long as the tibiae, 

 filiform, glabrous, scarcely rouih or pubescent beneath; the first four joints are 

 equal, the last joint is equal to the three preceding united ; the claws are mode- 

 rate, equal and simple. 



It will be found in comparing these characters with those of Dytiscus, that 

 the only important differences are in the form of the feet, and in the smaller 

 size of the posterior coxae. Now, although the Dytiscidae and Haliplidae, which 

 are certainly closely related, agree in having natatorial feet, they differ greatly 

 in the modification of form, those of Haliplus being much nearer the terrestrial, 




228 [January, 



or ambulatorial type. The posterior coxae also differ greatly in the two fami- 

 lies, those of Haliplus being dilated into a broad plate, under -which the poste- 

 rior legs can be withdrawn. We must, therefore, conclude that the differences 

 between Amphizoa and the two families just mentioned, are not of greater 

 valse than the differences between those two families themselves. 



The other relations of this insect from the form of the tarsi, would appear to 

 be slightly towards Parnus. The roughness of the surface above and below is 

 of a peculiar nature, and resembles very much what is found in certain Bupres- 

 tidas ; in fact, from the general appearance of the insect, it would at first sight 

 be supposed to have some affinity to the broad Madagascar Buprestidae forming 

 the genus Polybothris. Of its habits nothing is known. 



I would therefore divide the group now under consideration into four families, 

 thus : 



A. Mesosternum parvum ; (antennae filiformes, oculi duo, coxae intermediae 

 globosae.) 



1. Pedes ambulatorii, tenues, coxae posticae transversae,mediocres. Amph]zoid;e. 



2. Pedes subnatatorii, tenues, coxae posticae magnae laminatae. HaliplidjE. 



3. Pedes postici natatorii, compressi, coxae posticae magnae, sim- 



plices. Dytiscid-e. 



B. Mesosternum maximum; (antennae breves, perfoliatag, oculi quatuor.) 



4. Pedes posteriores natatorii, valde compressi, coxce intermediae 



triangulares planae. GYRiNiDiE. 



Having now ascertained as far as practicable the position of Amphizoa, we 

 may proceed to the specific description of the only species yet obtained. 



A. in s ol e n s, atra, opaca, subvirescens, glabra, thorace scabro, canalicu- 

 lato, antrorsum angustato, lateribus subserratis, ad medium subangulatis, 

 postice subangustato, angulis posticis acutis, elytris ovalibus, substriatis, 

 scabro-punctatis, thorace dupio latioribus. Long. '52. 



Sacramento, California, collected by Mr. J. Childs, and given me by Mr. 

 Rathvon. Color dull black, slightly tinged with greenish, without lustre. Head 

 irregularly rugous and punctulate, with two shallow impressions between the 

 antennae. Labrum covering the obtuse mandibles, slightly and broadly emar- 

 ginate in front. Thorax twice as wide as the head, flat, scabrous ; sides sub- 

 serrate, strongly narrowed from the middle to the apex, slightly narrowed and 

 subsinuate posteriorly ; base very broadly bisinuate, posterior angles acute; 

 disc channeled, with a shallow impression each side at the base, and a broad 

 transverse one before the middle. Elytra broadly oval, slightly convex, nearly 

 twice as wide as the thorax, scarcely one half longer than wide, scabrous with 

 shallow punctures, striate with nine slightly impressed grooves, which appear 

 coarsely and indistinctly punctured. Scutellum flat, broad, acute at apex. 

 Under surface of the body covered with shallow confluent punctures and 

 wrinkles. Legs scabrous with fine elevated punctures. No sexual difference 

 observed in five specimens examined. 



Stenocohts Lfc. (Atopidae.) 



Tarsi elongati tenues, unguibus simplicibus, paranychio bisetoso ; caput 

 clypeo distincto, antice membranaceo ; mandibulac apice integrae ; antennae 

 elongatae, serratae, articulo2ndo minuto ; palpi maxillares breviusculi cylindrici. 



This genus resembles in its characters Anchytarsus Giierin., but differs in 

 having a distinct transverse suture each side between the antennae ; in the 

 middle this suture is not obvious, but the front is slightly elevated, so that the 

 guture appears slightly sinuous ; the anterior part of the clypeus is membra- 

 neous ; the labrum is transverse and rounded ; the eyes are round, the proster- 

 num projects posteriorly, and the mesosternum is concave ; the tarsi are long 

 and slender, the first four joints are very slightly pubescent beneath, and 

 the first joint is a little elongated; the last joint is as long as the three pre- 

 ceding united. The claws are moderate and simple ; the intermediate appen- 

 dage is small and terminates in two bristles. 




IS 53.] 229 



The Atopidne seem by this ;eniis and Anchytarsus to show a slight affinity 

 towards the Parnidce, through the anomalous genus Eurypalpus Lee. (Proc. 

 Acad. Nat. Sc. 6, 41.) 



S. sc u te 11 a r is, elongato-oblongus, piceus, fusco pruinosus, thorace ptmc- 

 tato, antrorsum angustato, basi bisinuato, angulis posticis acutis, elytris scabro- 

 punctatis, scutello albo pubescente. Long. '^5 87. 



One pair, Sacramento, California, from Mr. Rathvon. Body elongate, nar- 

 rowed at each end, sides parallel at the middle, piceous, covered with very short 

 depressed, dirt colored pubescence. Antennae black, strongly serrate in the 

 male, slightly serrate in the female. Thorax nearly three times as wide as the 

 head, nearly twice as wide as long, strongly narrowed in front, sides at the 

 middle almost angulated, then slightly concave to the posterior angles, which 

 are acute ; base bisinuat? ; surface fint'ly punctured, broadly concave along the 

 margin behind the middle, and broadly transversely impressed at the base. 

 Scutellum round, covered with dense white hair. Elytra scabrous with shallow, 

 punctures, spaces between the punctures finely punctulate ; the elevated lines, 

 which may be traced in allied genera are slightly visible. Body beneath more 

 densely pruinose Vv^ith short cinereous hair. 



The other species of this family known to inhabit the United States are :

3. Dascillus melanophthalmus Guerin, loc. cit. No. 13, p. 6. I 

 have not seen this species, but learn from my father that it occurs in Georgia. 

 Atopa fusca M^-ls. (Proc. Acad. 2, 221) is, as Guerin has already observed, a 

 Ptilodactyla, and therefore cannot be placed in this family. 



The singuhr genus Zenoa Say (Bost. Journ. Nat. Hist. 1, 153,) differs from 

 the genera above cited, by its immarginate thorax, prominent mandibles, sub- 

 pectinate antennae, and elongate densely hairy paranychia ; these characters 

 approximate it to Saiidalus (female) ; from the Rhipiceridae, however, it differs 

 in having the anterior coxee more deeply imbedded between the pro- and meso- 

 sternum, and also in the absence of lobes on the under surface of the tarsi ; in the 

 Atopidae we know already that the latter is a variable character, and there 

 appears to me no good reason why the two families, Atopidae and Rhipiciderae 

 should not be merged together. The synonymy of the only species of Zenoa 

 known to me is : 



Z. p i c e a Lee. Journ. Acad. Nat. Sc. New Ser. 1, S9. Melasis picea Beau- 

 vois, Ins. 7, tab. 7, fig. 1. Sandaltis {Zenoa) picea Say, Bost. Journ. Nat. 

 Hist. 1, 152. Zevoa vulnerata Lee. loc. cit. 



Middle and Western States : the last synonym belongs to a variety with the 

 thorax partly red. 



Cerophytum is usually placed in the vicinity of these genera, and has been 

 bandied about between Eucnemides, Rhipiceridag and Cebrionidae ; it must, 

 however, belong to the latter family. The great development of the trochanters 

 entirely separates the femora from the coxae ; the same structure is to be found 

 in Cebrio bicolor, although the trochanters are not so long ; the indistinct 

 labrum and globular anterior coxae also place it with Cebrio, while the whole 

 form of the head, as well as the general appearance, would separate it froin the 

 Eucnemides, which, as I have already observed,* should be considered as a 

 group of Elateridag. The small mandibles and lobed tarsi are certainly very 

 different from those of Cebrio, but we know that the latter character is merely 

 of generic value in both Elateridae and Atopidag. The description of Haldeman 

 is incorrect as regards the posterior feet, in which the coxa, are said to be very

 Mr. Clark, under Col. J. D. Graham. Body elongate, parallel, very finely 

 pubescent, luteous yellow ; antennae black, 3d joint nearly equal to the 4th; 

 head elongate, palpi and mandibles black ; occiput sometimes fuscous ; thorax 

 nearly twice as wide as the head, longer than wide, apex very niuch rounded,

Two specimens from Tampico (Mexico), Lieut. H. Ilaldeman ; and one from 

 the Mexican Boundary, collected by Mr. Clark. This is the largest species I 

 have seen. Head black, front mouth and base of antennas rufous. Thorax very 

 finely punctured, one half wider than long, rounded, rufous, with a large hexa- 

 gonal black spot, which is a little emarginate before and behind. Elytra wider 

 than the thorax, very densely punctured, rufous with four blue spots, which are 

 so large that only a narrow sutural lateral and apical margin and a transverse 

 band before the middle remain reddish yellow. Beneath black, with the ante- 

 pectus, and margins of the abdominal segments testaceous. Feet black; knees 

 obsoletely rufous. 



The outer joints of the antennae of the male are dark colored, though not 

 black as in the female.

few black bristles intermixed ; color bright scarlet, with a black humeral spot, 

 and a black band at the second third of their length, which almost reaches the 

 side and the suture, leaving only the extreme bead of the margins red. Beneath 

 black, abdomen sanguineous. 



The posterior band of the elytra is sometimes narrow and more widely inter- 

 rupted at the suture ; the elytra are sometimes orange-colored, rather than 

 scarlet.

Two females from the Mexican Boundary, collected as above. The genus 

 was founded by M. Milne-Edwards in the " Catalogue de la Collection Entomo- 

 logique du Museum d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris," p. 149, upon Melolontha 

 lanceolata Say, (Journ. Acad. Nat. Sc. 3,242), with which this species agrees 

 in form and structure, but differs remarkably by the coarse sculpture of the 

 upper surface, and by the absence of all pubescence or scaly appendages. The 

 latter may have been removed by the alcohol in which the specimens were pre- 

 served, but on very careful examination no trace of them could be found. The 

 body beneath is shining, sparsely and finely punctured, with a short hair pro- 

 ceeding from each puncture. 



(A male seen in the Smithsonian Institution at Washington, differed in having 

 the body more regularly oval, less convex, and not inflated posteriorly.)

San Diego and Sta Isabel, California. Black, almost without lustre. Head 

 finely scabrous ; mentum shallow, moderately concave, rounded in front, ob- 

 liquely narrowed behind, so as to be slightly angulated posteriorly. Thorax 

 one half wider than long, narrowed in front, rounded on the sides ; disc tolerably 

 densely, not deeply punctured, with short bristles from the punctures ; anterior 

 angles foveate internally, posterior angles acute, scarcely elevated ; base 

 bisinuate, faintly impressed each side. Elytra fl.attened, not uneven, sparsely 

 punctured with large elliptical shallow foveae, from which proceed short 

 bristles. 



This species is larger than C. canaliculatus Kirhy, and is very different 

 in the form of the mentum and thorax, and in the less distinct punctuation of 

 the head. There is not a trace of emargination at the posterior part of the 

 mentum ; the anterior angles of the thorax appear to be more deeply foveate in 

 the male than in the female. The excellent labors of Dr. Schaum in the pre- 

 sent tribe are well known to every entomologist. 



2. C. Kn o chii, ater, subnitidus, glaber, thorace parce varioloso canalicu-

Missouri Territory. Black, with but little lustre. Head densely punctured, 

 mentum shallow, moderately concave, rounded in front, obliquely narrowed 

 behind, so as to form an angle posteriorly. Thorax almost one half wider than 

 long, channelled, narrowed in front, rounded on the sides ; disc sparsely punc- 

 tured, punctures large and shallow ; anterior angles with a small fovea, pos- 

 terior acute, shining, moderately elevated, base scarcely sinuate, with a broad 

 moderately deep impression each side. Elytra flattened, with indications of 

 two broad grooves on each side ; surface somewhat irregular, impressed with

large shallow elliptical punctures. This and the preceding seem related to C. 

 mexicanus Schaii77i (Germ. Zeitschr. 3, 256 ; Am. Ent. Fr. 2d ser. 2, pi. 11, 

 fig. 8), but the posterior angles are not tuberculate. 



Two specimens of this species were found by me on the Arkansas River, near 

 the Rocky Mountains ; one of them is now in the collection of Dr. Schaum. 

 Descriptions of this and the next species were furnished by me four years ago 

 to Mr. Westwood, for an anticipated monograph of Cremastochilus, which, how- 

 ever, although quoted in Schaum's Catalogue of Oetoniae, appears not to have 

 been published ; and therefore considering them as interesting additions to our 

 fauna, I take the present opportunity of making them known. 



3. C. n i t e n s, nigro-castaneus, nitidus, breviter setosus, thorace parce vario- 

 loso, antrorsum valde angustato, basi subito constricto, angulis posticis auricu-

Missouri Territory. Brownish black, shining. Head strongly scabrous ; 

 mentum deeply concave, subrhomboidal, anteriorly broadly rounded, lateral and 

 posterior angles distinct. Thorax one half wider than long, strongly narrowed 

 in front, rounded on the sides, very strongly constricted near the base, so that 

 the base is not wider than the apex; surface sparsely and deeply punctured, 

 with very short yellow bristles proceeding from the punctures ; anterior angles 

 not acute, deeply foveate, posterior angles forming a round shining tubercle, 

 separated by a deep cut from the body of the thorax ; base very much depressed, 

 smooth. Elytra deep red towards the middle, flattened, slightly uneven, covered 

 with moderately close rounded shallow punctures, from which proceed short 

 yellow hairs. 



These three species seem to belong to Burmeister's genus Psilocnemis, by 

 the form of the lower lip, but as there is not a complete resemblance among 

 them in this respect, 1 follow Schaum's example in merging the two genera 

 together. 



Among our previously described Cremastochilus, may also be observed con- 

 siderable difl^erence in the form of the lower lip. That organ is only slightly 

 emarginate posteriorly in C. variolosus, while it is deeply cleft in C. Harrisii, 

 canaliculatus and castanea?. C. junior (Westw.), quoted in Schaum's Catalogue 

 of Lamellicornia melitophila, is unknown to me, nor have I in my collection 

 any specimens from the Atlantic States, which cannot be referred to the four 

 species just mentioned. 



C. p o 1 i t u s Schaum (P.s-/7orf!??i?'.s /e?ico5^/c Burm.) is considered as North 

 American on the authority of a single specimen communicated by Mr. Gory to 

 Burmeister. The fact that the Western species above described agree in the 

 absence of the emargination of the lower lip, induces me to believe that the 

 species in question is really Mexican. The distinction of locality in regard to 

 North America is very frequently not attended to with sufficient care by Euro- 

 pean Naturalists, who possibly have a prophetic eye towards the extension of 

 ihe republic ; which event, however desirable for the increase of our fauna, 

 cannot alter the preordained laws of distribution of species. 



Alloeocnemis Lee. (Nitidularia?, Peltides.) 



Oculi duo laterales prominuli; aatetmfc 11-articulatae, articulis tribus ultimis 

 maioribus, distantibus ; frons concava, apice emarginata ; tibiae posteriores mu- 

 ticse ; anticae extus serratae, spina apicali uncata. 



1 have merely given the characters to distinguish this curious genus from the 

 genera described by Erichson (Germ. Zeitschr. 5, 445, &c.) ; the only two allied 

 to it by the form of the eyes are Egolia and Acalantha, from which it is very 

 distinct by having three enlarged antennal joints. Its form is nearly that of 

 Nemosoma, but its greater size renders its appearance very singular. The 

 pectus and tibine are very hairy ; the two posterior pairs of tibi;p not spinous, 

 with two terminal spurs, of which one is so small as to be indistinct; the 

 anterior tibiae are slightly compressed, the outer margin serrate, with small 

 distant teeth, of which the lowest is most distinct; the apex is obliquely trun-

cate; the terminal spur is tolerably large and curved. The tarsi are filiform, 

 the first joint very small, inferior, the 2d equal to the rest united. The antennae 

 are slender and not much longer than the head; the first joint is a little longer 

 than the 4th, the 3d is a little shorter than the 2d, which is about one half as 

 long as the first ; the 4th 8th are nearly equal, and cylindrical ; the 9th and 

 10th triangular, a little longer than wide; the 11th oval, about equal to the 

 10th ; these last three are compressed, and about twice as wide as those which 

 precede.

San Francisco, California, given me by my friend Dr. A. B. Stout, to whom 

 1 take pleasure in dedicating it. Body dull black ; head large, obtuse, covered 

 with coarse granulations, with a few erect black hairs ; front deeply concave ; 

 mandibles thick and prominent, apex acute. Thorax narrower than the head 

 with the eyes, not wider than long, truncate at base and apex, narrowed behind, 

 sides almost straight, deflexed sides scabrous, with erect black hairs ; 

 disc finely punctnlate, broadly transversely impressed before the middle ; 

 ww^h a very obsolete longitudinal line extending from base to apex. Elytra as 

 wide as the head and eyes, elongate, cylindrical, finely punctulate and rugous=, 

 with small confluent wrinkles, which are less dense and more distinct towards 

 the base. Scutellum very small, impressed. Beneath finely and densely punc- 

 tulate, pectus covered with long yellow hair.

D. geminatus, piceus, nitidus, thorace valde transverse, antice non angus-

This very large species was collected by Dr. Henry, U. S. A., at Albu- 

 querque, New Mexico, and kindly sent to me. It is easily distinguished from 

 all the other species, by having in addition to the three usual large spines, a 

 smaller one formed by the anterior angle being produced outwards. The elytra 

 are entirely smooth, except at the base, where a few indistinct rugae are visible; 

 the lateral reflexed margin is much narrower than in the other species ; the 

 suture presents scarcely a trace of the spine at the apex ; the abdomen is smooth, 

 the pectus is covered with short yellow hair. The antennas (of the female) are 

 scarcely half as long as the body, slender, with the three first joints polished 

 and sparsely punctured ; the third joint is feebly sulcate longitudinally. The 

 legs are precisely as in the other species. 



Callichroma Latr.

Mexican Boundary, collected by Mr. Clark; another specimen found in 

 Texas by Lieut. Haldeman. In size and form exactly resembles C. splendidum 

 ic., but differs very much in the sculpture of the thorax and uniform green 

 color of the upper surface. 



Eburia Serv. 



E. muti c a, picea, fusco pubescens, thorace subcylindrico, lateribus paulo

 exteriore, posticoque interiore minoribus, apice truncatis. Long. '67 -SS. 



This interesting species was first found by Lieut. Haldeman at Tampico, and 

 I have recently obtained a specimen collected at New Braunfels in Texas, by 

 Mr. Lindheimer. The thorax is scarcely longer than wide, and slightly rounded 

 on the sides ; the lateral spine is represented by a mere elevated point ; the disc 

 is sparsely punctured, but the hair obscures the punctures ; before the middle 

 there are two shining black tubercles, and on each side, nearer the ante- 




234 [January, 



rior angle is another similar tubercle. The elytra are coarsely punctured, 

 slightly truncate, but not armed at tip ; they hjiVe each four small polished lines 

 associated by pairs, but not united, the outer basal one is very small ; the inner 

 one of the posterior pair, which is placed about the middle, is smaller than the 

 outer. 



Physocnemum Huld. 



P. araethystinum, nigrum, thorace transverso, lateribus valde rotun-

 Long. '75. 



This species has a general resemblance in appearance to P. Proteus, but differs 

 from all the species known to me in having the anterior as well as the posterior 

 thighs simple ; the thorax is narrowed in front, rounded on the sides, suddenly 

 narrowed towards the base, which is slightly tubulate; the sides are very 

 densely and confluently punctured, the disc less densely so, with three indistinct 

 smooth longitudinal elevations. The elytra are shining violet blue, finely and 

 densely punctured, the punctures becoming larger and less dense towards the 

 base. 



One specimen was found at Sacramento, California, by Mr. J. Childs, and 

 given me by Mr. Rathvon. 



A Callidium from the same collection is very similar to the female of C an- 

 tennatum, but the thorax is more densely punctured; I can otherwise discover 

 no difference. 



Cacoplia Lee. 



Having, since the publication of my essay on Longicornia, obtained, through 

 the kindness of Mr. Haldeman, the original specimen of his Saperda 'ptdlata, I 

 have convinced myself that it must be referred to this genus, proposed by me in 

 the Journal of the Academy (New Ser. 2, 149.) The following diagnoses will 

 enable the two species at once to be distinguished : 



1. C. pull at a, fusco-testacea, brevissime densius sordide pubescens, thorace 

 parce punctato, linea dorsali postice glabi-a, elytris thorace latioribus cylin- 

 dricis parce minus distincte punctatis. Long. -68.

2. C. p ruin OS a, testacea, brevissime cinereo pubescens, thorace obscu- 

 riore, sat dense punctato, linea dorsali postica glabra, elytris thorace latioribus, 

 cylindricis, distinctius parce punctatis. Long. '47.

MoNiLEMA Say, 



i\. M. a r m a t u m, elongatum, nigrum, thorace laevi, lateribus acute spinosis, 

 apice et basi punctis marginato, elytris subrugosis, parce grosse punctatis, apice 

 Isevibus, dorso convexis, lateribus subito declivibus. Long. 1-25. 



Mexican Boundary, collected as before mentioned. This species is similar to 

 M. semipunctatum Lee (Journ. Acad. Nat, Sc. 2, 2, 167,) but the form is 

 more elongate, the thorax is smooth on the disc, and the elytra are more punc- 

 tured and rugous. 



2. M. c r a s s u m, breviusculum, nigrum, thorace lateribus subtuberculato, 

 disco opaco parce punctato, margine postico punctato, elytris convexis, subru- 

 gosis minus dense variolosis, apice laevibus. Long. '8. 



With the preceding. This species is similar to M. a n n u 1 a t u m Say, but is 

 stouter in its form. The elytra are much more coarsely punctured, the punc- 

 tures extend further along the epipleurae and suture, than along the disc ; the 

 elytra are very convex, the sides descend more abruptly than in M. annulatum, 

 but less so than in M. armatum.

There are now five species 'of this genus known to me; they appear to be 

 quite limited in their distribution, and are by no means common in the locality 

 where they occur. It is very probable that further investigation in the interior 

 of the continent will show that the Dorcadidae of North America are quite 

 numerous, although thus far they exhibit a lamentable uniformity of color, 

 which will render the determination of species somewhat difficult, without 

 actual comparison of specimens. 



NosoDER3iA Solier. 



N. porcatum, depressum, sordide fuscum, thorace latitudine non longiore, 

 postice angustato, valde inaequali, elytris sutura costisque 3 elevatis, intermedia 

 utrinquc abbreviata, interstitiis irregulariter biseriatim punctatis ; apice tuber- 

 culatis. Long. '57. 



Sacramento, Mr. Rathvon. Bears a strong resemblance to N. obcordatum, 

 but is darker colored, the inequalities of the thorax are smaller and more nume- 

 rous, and the punctures and elevations of the elytra much more regular ; the 

 outer and inner costae end about one sixth of the length of the elytra from the 

 tip, in moderate dilatations ; the intermediate costa commences about one fifth 

 from the base, and ends about one fourth from the tip ; near the tip on each 

 elytron is a large rough tubercle. The under surface of the body appears black, 

 and is more distinctly punctured than in N. obcordatum. 



There are now three species of this genus known to me as inhabiting the 

 United States, viz. N. di abo 1 ic u m Lee. (Ann. Lye. 5, 130) ; N. obcor- 

 datum Lee. (iV. inaquale[ Dej. Cat. ; Boletophagns ohcordaUis Kirby, Faun. 

 Bor. Am. 236) ; and N. porcatum Lee, just described. 



Mycterds OHv. 



M. concolor, fusco-niger, subtiliter cinereo-pubescens, capite thoraceque 

 confertissime subtilius punctatis, elytris alutaceis minus dense subtiliter punc- 

 tatis, subtus argenteo-pubescens, tibiis tarsisque vix rufescentibus. Long. -3. 



Sta Fe, New ^Mexico, Mr. Fendler. The antennae are entirely black, and a 

 little longer than the head and thorax. The following diagnosis will distinguish 

 the previously described North American species : 



M. s caber, fusco-niger, luteo-pubescens, capite thoraceque confertissime 

 punctulatis, elytris grosse sat dense punctatis, antennis pedibusque rufo-testa- 

 ceis. Long. -15 23. 



Haldeman, Pr. Acad. Nat. Sc. 1, 303. 



Southern States, abundant ; Pennsylvania, rare. The pubescence of the under 

 surface is somewhat silvery ; the antennae are a little darker externally than 

 at base. 



The only other member of this group of insects yet known from our coun- 

 try is, Sphaeriestes virescens Lee. ( Agassiz' Lake Superior, 232.)

 Found in the spring season under logs. 



Five specimens of Triton torosus, Eschscholtz/* (Triton granulosa, Skillton, 

 Sill. Journ. v. vii.) These amphibians are very abundant on the edges of rivers 

 toward the spring ; those found by Dr. Heermann were in a mountainous coun- 

 try. The river Calaveres having overflowed its banks, had left small basins of 

 water in the rocks, in one of which about thirty were seen together. Their 

 habits appeared to be indolent ; when disturbed, they swam away in a sluggish 

 manner, moving the tail chiefly, the anterior extremities lying closely in con- 

 tact with the body. A hundred might be seen in the course of a day, after a 

 slight rain, the ground being moist, disappearing slowly when approached. 

 Belly of a deep bright vermillion saff"ron, as well as the under part of tail and 

 extremities ; above very dark brown, appearing almost black during life. 



The reptiles above described were presented to the Academy by Adolphus 

 L. Heermann, M. D., who has recently returned to Philadelphia, after a journey 

 of three years' duration, spent, for the most part, in Natural History pursuits, in 

 California and in various parts of S. America. Through his zeal and liberality, 

 the Museum of our Institution has been greatly enriched in the departments of Or- 

 nithology, Mammalogy, Mineralogy and Herpetology, thus presenting a useful 

 and honorable example of leisure and wealth devoted to the noblest of human 

 pursuits, the study of the phenomena and laws of the material universe. 



The Committee appointed under a Resolution of the Academy, 

 adopted Dec. 30, 1851, to collect subscriptions for the purpose of 

 enlarging and improving the Hall, 



Reported^ That the condition of the Eesolution had been complied 

 with, and that six thousand five hundred dollars, the amount required 

 to carry out the plan of enlargement then approved of by the Academy, 

 had been secured. 



Further improvements had, however, since the above date, been found 

 necessary by the Committee, and the plan had been extended, the addi- 

 tional estimated cost of which would be about $2000. Part of this 

 additional sum had already been subscribed. 



The Report was adopted, and the Committee continued. 



The following members were appointed a Building Committee : viz. 

 Dr. T. B. Wilson, Dr. Robert Bridges and Mr. W. S. Vaux. 



The Report of the Publication Committee for 1852 was read and 

 adopted. 



Dr. Leidy offered the following Preamble and Resolutions, which 

 were adopted : 



* Zoologische Atlas, Berlin, 1829. 

 t Holbrook, Herpetol., vol. iii. p. 81. 




1853.] 239 



The Academy being informed that the Commissioners of the General Land 

 Office, in Washington, in their estimates for the land surveys of the coming season, 

 have inserted an item for the geological survey of Oregon and the Mauvaises 

 Terres of Nebraska, in which previous surveys have shown there exists the 

 most remarkable and interesting fresh M-ater tertiary geological formation yet 

 discovered iu this country, therefore it is 



Resolved, That the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia earnestly 

 recommends the prosecution of these surveys, believing as it does that the 

 district proposed to be surveyed embraces a portion of the most interesting 

 geological region in this country, and that the result must be of the highest 

 importance to science, and is destined to throw a new light upon the natural 

 history of this continent previous to the period when the mammoth and mas- 

 todon lived. 



Resolved, That the Academy would respectfully urge and request Congress 

 not to permit the opportunity to pass to make the necessary appropriation to 

 accomplish the desirable objects above stated, and have the s'irveys carried out 

 according to the recommendation of the Commissioners of the General Land 

 Office. 



Resolved, That this preamble and series of resolutions be signed by the officers 

 of the Academy, and sent by the Corresponding Secretary to the Commissioners 

 of the Land Office at Washington. 



On motion of Dr. Elwyn, copies of the foregoinof were directed to be 

 sent to the Senators from Pennsylvania, and the Representatives from 

 the city and county of Philadelphia.

 only the duty of the naturalist, but a necessity of science. The difficulty in 

 the attempt is to ascertain with precision the date of publication of each species, 

 and when this cannot otherwise be obtained, perhaps it would be right to refer 

 to the date on the title-page of the volume wherein the species maybe described. 

 Mr. Lea never refers to the date of publication, but says, " my memoir bears 

 date," &c., which means, the day it was read before a meeting of a Society, 

 though not published in some instances until two years afterwards. In adopting 

 the names given by Rafinesque, the rule will be observed to quote no species 

 without a mark of doubt, which is not clearly borne out by the description, 

 assisted by reference to Rafinesque's shells marked by his own hand, and now 

 placed in the noble collection of Charles A. Poulson, Esq. 



It is true Rafinesque's descriptions are brief and many of them obscure, and 

 his figures rude. Others again are better characterized than some of Lamarck's. 

 Mr. Lea complains that Say has not left him one species in his very short and 

 incomplete ' Synonymy of Western Unios ;" but on the other hand, Mr. Lea 

 credits Rafinesque with only two species of the sixty or seventy he has named 

 and described. 



Every man must work according to his means and his abilities. Rafinesque, 

 in his day, was destitute of the advantages many naturalists now enjoy, and 

 could not publish expensive plates ; and, unfortunately, he had the examples of 

 Linne and Lamarck for short and indefinite descriptions. If Rafinesque's 

 names should be rejected, there seems no reason why Lamarck's should not 

 share the same fate. 



Of late years, Comparative Anatomy has shown that genera can readily be 

 founded on differences in organisation of the animal inhabitants of shells vary- 

 ing little in external character, whilst among the Nafades there are divisions so 

 well marked by the external character as well as the hinge, that generic differ- 

 ences can be safely predicted to exist among the animals which inhabit them. 

 These various genera are moreover not indiscriminately placed in every quarter 

 of the globe, but some are peculiar to one country and some to another, as Paxy- 

 ODON and Prisodon to tropical South America ; Pleiodon to tropical Africa, &c., 

 and yet an author, even in the present day, is content to arrange the Naiades in 

 a singularly artificial system, embracing one genus and seven subgenera. Mr, 

 Gray's arrangement is far more natural and useful, but he does not subdivide 

 to the extent that Mr. Swainson did, who was the first to give a philosophical 

 view of the subject, and to have an idea of geographical distribution of genera. 

 Mr. Swainson, speaking of the tuberculated Unios of North America, observes, 

 "Where we find a character, however trivial it may appear, pervading a whole 

 group, we may be perfectly assured that it is a natural character, althoujjh it may 

 not be the only one." And if this is true of the exterior, a similar uniformity of 

 character in the hinge is still more important ; and how strongly marked it is 

 in Paxyodon, Pleiodon and others ! 



It is supposed that this family existed at as early a period as the Carboni- 

 ferous, but it is doubtful if the shells usually referred to Uxio were members of 

 this group. Certainly none of the existing genera are represented in the bivalves 

 of that era, nor is there any even in the Lower Tertiary ; but in the Crag or 

 Middle Tertiary, the two genera, U:<io and Anodonta make their first 

 appearance. 



It is worthy of remark that a genus so nearly related to Unio as Trigonia, 

 abounded in numerous species in the Oolitic and Cretaceous eras, and then 

 ceasing to exist during the long Tertiary periods, reappeared in a solitary species 

 of the present day. Is not this long interval between the fossil and recent 




244 [February^ 



species, presumptive evidence that the animal of the living shell is generically 

 different from that of the extinct species ? The hinge of a bivalve shell will 

 not always serve to determine a genus, else Platyodon, w^ould be a Mya, and 

 Mycetopus an Anodonta ; but when a material difference exists in the hinge, 

 some important variation may be expected to exist in the animal organization. 

 By means of Comparative Anatomy, Agassiz has discovered differences in the 

 animals of the North American Unios, which he considers sufficient to warrant 

 the construction of several genera, and when these are fully determined and 

 compared with those of Asia, Africa, &c., it will very likely ha found that the 

 various genera are restricted to narrower geographical limits than the mere 

 external characters of the shells would lead us to suppose. 



I have at present not ventured to do more than indicate subgenera^ except 

 among a few distinct groups. In Complanaria, Swai?is., the hinge is so pecu- 

 liar and different from the other genera, that it is fully as well entitled to a 

 generic distinction as Alasmodonta or Barbala. There is another small group 

 which is somewhat isolated, the plicated shells, having bold and distinctive 

 characters. This has been separated from Unio under the name of Pleotomerus. 

 The only aberrant form in the genus is U. crassidetis, Lam., which, however, 

 has no affinity with any other group. JJ. infucatus, though somewhat plicated, 

 has a very different character, and belongs to a distinct group. The Z7. rotun- 

 datu^. Lam., is an isolated shell, with the cardinal teeth more like those of Naia, 

 Swainson, an Asian subgenus, than the other North American Unios.

* I have not quoted Stimpson for this species, because he says that the Ohio 

 species is different from the shell usually regarded as the same, which inhabits 

 Lake Champlain, and he refers only to the latter. Rafinesque described the 

 Western shell. As Say's IT. alatus was found in Lake Erie, I do not know 

 whether Agassiz considers it the same as the Ohio river species, or as that of 

 Lake Champlain.

* This species is identical with the interruptus of Say and trapezoides of Lea. 

 The description antice binis ternisve subsinuosa," can apply to no other 

 species which could be compared with Say's interruptus. This description 

 applies to (a) of Lam., which Mr. Lea acknowledges to be his trapezoides, 

 and is the type of crassidens. How, then, can he set it aside, and take up h 

 as the type of that species, especially as it does not agree with the description?

NOTES. 



(a.) XJnio asper. Ferussac considered this species and Say's apiculatus the 

 same; but there is a strongly marked difference in the arrangement of the 

 tubercles and in the form of the shells posteriorly. (Guerin's Mag. 1835.) 



(5.) U. cariosns. In my Monograph I followed Ferussac in referring U. 

 luteola. Lam!, to this species, but his description does not apply. It very well 

 describes U. stliquoidens, Barnes, in an early stage of growth. 




1853.] 265 



(e.) U. cerinus. This species cannot be confounded 'w\\}ci flavtis ; it has much 

 less prominent beaks, more compressed disks, is proportionally longer, with the 

 hinge and basal margins more nearly parallel, while the color of the epidermis 

 and of nacre are very different. Mr. Lea seems to have hastily made them one 

 species, probably without having time or inclination to compare them. 



(fi.) TJ. complauatus^ Soland. There has been some controversy respecting 

 the original name of this species, but it seems clear that Solander had Say's 

 purpnreus in view when he described his species. He not only remarks that it 

 inhabits rivers in Maryland and New Jersey, but his description, " ovate, com- 

 pressed, with the front (posterior) margin straight, obliquely truncated towards 

 the cardinal slope, hinge with the primary teeth three-sided and striated," applies 

 very well to a common variety of Say's purpureifs. If Solander's name had 

 been founded alone on the figure in Lister, t. 150, fig. 5, it could not be retained, 

 because the species intended to be represented by that figure will probably ever 

 be disputed; and it represents U. niger, Rdif., much better than the shell in 

 question. Lamarck even quotes it for crasside?is, (Lea's trapezoides,) which it 

 certainly does not resemble. The words " admodum crassus," engraved on 

 Lister's plate, prove that it was an exceedingly thick shell, and a Western 

 species. 



(/.) Z7. clava. Kuster has quoted Rafinesque's figures 23 and 24 for his gibbosa, 

 w-hich is a nodulosus species not figured on any of his plates. Those figures 

 represent U. scaleuia. 



(g.) TJ. nodiferus, Con. Mr. Lea considers this identical with prasinux. 

 Since I have compared several specimens with a fine series of the latter species, 

 I see little resemblance between them. The nodiferus is a smaller, more ven- 

 tricose and inequilateral shell, and the large tubercles grouped together about 

 the middle of the disc, are never seen vd prasiniis. The latter has the slightly 

 prominent tear-shaped tubercles like the young qiiadrulus, very dissimilar in 

 number, shape and prominence to those of the nodiferus. Three specimens of 

 the latter, from Alabama, are in the collection of the Academy. 



(Ji.) U. ockraceus, Say. T. 157, fig. 12, in Lister's Conch., is usually referred to 

 A}wdo7ita cataracta of Say, but it much better agrees with the Southern variety 

 of U. ochraceus. The color, ' subruber," does not agree with any of our Ano- 

 dontas^ and, moreover, Lister names it Pectunculus, under which general term 

 he includes Galathea, Paxyodon and Cyclas, w'hich is sufficient evidence that 

 his Pectunculus fluviatilis had well defined teeth. The cardinal teeth of the 

 Southern ochraceus being distinctly striated, would account for the name of 

 Pectunculus being applied to it. Besides, it will be observed that Lister com- 

 mences the Auodontas with the heading of " Section 2d, De musculis cardine 

 laevi," which includes three species. His Section 3d then commences under 

 the heading of " Pectunculus." This is proof positive that his t. 157, fig. 12, 

 is not an Anodonta. 



(t.) U, oUiquus, Lam. Mr. Lea has referred Barnes' k?z^<2;^?,s to this species, 

 but Lamarck's description is wholly inapplicable to xindatus^ which is not 

 oblique, and certainly not " ovate-rotundate." The error probably originated 

 in Barnes' citation of Lamarck's species with a mark of doubt, as synonymous 

 with iindat^is. 



(j.) U. plexus, Con. There is a variety of this species, more elliptical, and 

 with the umbo and upper part of the disc covered with closely-arranged granu- 

 lations. It is possible that this may prove to be a distinct species. U. semi- 

 granosusy some conchologists think the same species with U. plexus, but it 

 certainly cannot be, if von dem Busch's species is represented in Phillippi's 

 Conchyi. pi. 1, fig. 1. That is a far larger shell, and of a totally different 

 character. 



(/t.) TJ. prasinus, Con. Mr. Lea observes that Prof. Kirtland thinks this 

 may prove to be a variety of pustulosus^ {hullatus, Raf.) They are, however. 




266 [liEBKUAKX, 



very distinct species, the prasinus being much longer comparatively, with 

 fewer and less-prominent tubercles, and arranged in a very different manner. 

 The cardinal plate under the beaks is not dilated ; in the nodulatus^ it is pro- 

 f Hindi y dilated, a very important difference, which it is strange should have 

 b -en overlooked. Young shells of prasimis and bidlatus, when compared, are 

 strikingly dissimilar. 



(/.) U. purpurattis, Lam. There is no doubt that Solander named this species 

 ventricosa, as Humphreys terms it " La Ventrue rouge," and gives the habitat 

 of "Mississippi river," where it abounds, and where no other species has beer 

 found which agrees with the description. 



(7.) Z7. qicadndus is not 11. rugosus, Barnes. Mr. Lea remarks that some of 

 our best Western conchologists think Z7. mgosus identical with 77. fragosus. 

 Barnes' figure certainly has little resemblance to the latter, and the " broad 

 nodulous, somewhat dotible ridge," wholly inapplicable to quadmlus. Mr. Lea 

 says, *' two specimens referred to by Mr. B. as rugosus, were under my inspec- 

 tion, and proved to be, the one a flat metaiievery and the other a plicatus.^^ Now 

 the rugosus may be the metaiieurus , Raf., but Barnes' figure was never intended 

 for any variety of the TJ. plicatics, 



Mr. Say has unfortunately copied Barnes' description of Z7. rugosus , and 

 applied it to U. quadrulus, Raf. 



(.) JJ. undatus. It has been supposed that this was the shell described by 

 Mr. Lea as trigonus^ but it is distinct. There is a fine specimen of tmdatus in 

 the collection of the Academy, which agrees perfectly with Barnes' figure, and 

 is much more ventricose anteriorly and over the umbo, than trigomis ; has more 

 elevated beaks, and is very inequilateral, whilst the latter is nearly equila- 

 teral. The uiidatics is equallyj^distinct from cordatus, Raf., which is compara- 

 tively compressed. 



Compare Barnes* description, " subtriangular, very tumid, waved," with La- 

 marck's description of U, obliqua, *' ovato-rofundate, oblique," and the discre- 

 pancy must strike every one ; yet both Lea and Deshayes make them one 

 species. 



Z7. tcndulat2is, Barnes. The old specimens of this species have so much 

 resemblance to Say's heros, as even to have deceived Say himself, who aban- 

 doned his species, and referred it to Barnes's undulaUis ; but it is a very 

 distinct species, the young shell having little resemblance to that of the latter. 

 There can be no doubt that Barnes figured the species now known as the 

 eostatus of Raf. 



(o.) U. viridis, Raf. Mr. Lea gives another name to this shell, because he 

 says it is not Rafinesque's species, which it certainly is ; yet he does not 

 acknowledge Rafinesque as authority, for he applies his specific names, as in 

 the case of Z7. interruptus, to a species of his own ; consequently the shell in 

 question should have been quoted by him as TJ. viridis. Con., unless he has one 

 rule applicable to himself and another referable to other authors. The shell 

 labelled viridis by Rafinesque himself in Mr. Poulson's cabinet, is the same as 

 Lea's Tappianus. 



Anodonta. 



(a.) A. cataractay Say. The Mytilus jiicviatilis of Gmel. and Dillwyn, and 

 the M. illitus of Solander, appear to be merely names given to the JJnio ochra- 

 ceus in Lister's work, t. 157, fig. 12. The two AuodoiUa.'i figured by Lister, t. 

 154, 155, and having Virg. inscribed upon the plates, I cannot refer to any of 

 our species. 



(5.) A. marginata^ Say. Dekay regarded this shell as the young oi implicatay 

 and it is not unlikely his opinion was correct. It certainly is not Say's 

 eataracta.

Supplementary Notes. 



TJ. cuneatns, Haf. Having examined several specimens of this shell, it is 

 found to be a form between U. paUUus and U. clav2is, and may be a distinct 

 species. 



TJ. fasrioliis^ Raf. Mr. Poulson's specimen labelled by Rafinesque, is not U. 

 mulliradiatits, but certainly TJ. suhangulatus. Lea. 



Z7. simplexy Lea. It is strange that Mr. Lea should compare this shell with 

 TI. Hydiatins, to w^hich it bears no resemblance, and at the same time overlook 

 U. Greeiiii, Con. His figure might almost answer for a copy of mine. 



77. triangularis, Raf. Mr. Poulson's cabinet contains no authentic specimen 

 of this species, which is one I have never identified. Pachostea, Cliffordiana 

 and lateralis are also uncertain species. Lamjpsilis rosea and pallida are pro- 

 bably varieties of TJ. ochracetcs.

An emimeration of the Vines of North America. 

 By John Le Conte, F. L. S. 



In attempting to give some account of the vines of our country, a very con- 

 siderable difficulty arises, even at the outset, from the great similarity of the 

 diff"erent species. A family resemblance almost amounting to identity runs 

 through the whole of them. Hence, characters which are taken as distinctive, 

 may appear too slight to warrant us in separating as distinct species what at 

 first sight might appear to be mere varieties. But setting aside the shape and 

 appearance of the leaves, the nature of the fruit and the method of its growth, 

 in most cases, furnish a good criterion for distinguishing closely allied species 

 from each other, which might in vain be sought for elsewhere. 



Some years ago, when there existed a mania for the cultivation of the vine, 




270 [February, 



there was much written about our native grapes, which only tended to involve 

 in obscurity a rather plain and easily developed subject. Men unacquainted 

 with botany, gardeners and others, remarkable only for their ignorance, folly 

 and bad faith, gave names to various kinds of grapes, and frequently made a 

 dozen species out of one. These names, barbarous and unmeaning as 

 they are, were never bestowed on the same variety by any two writers ; they 

 saw differences where none existed, and endeavored to account for them by 

 supposing impossibilities. Thus, a variety of V. labrusca, which has been called 

 the Isabella and Catawba grape, and received several other as ridiculous appel- 

 lations, has been considered as a hybrid between a European and one of our 

 native species. This variety has always been said to have been first found in 

 South Carolina, a country where the V. vinifera had at that time seldom or never 

 been cultivated, and where it by no means flourishes, and where likewise the 

 labrusca is not found. Although among some families of plants hybrids occur 

 naturally or may be formed artificially, yet it is difficult to understand how this 

 ever can be the case in the genus Vitis. In forming a hybrid, it is necessary 

 to emasculate the flower which we wish to produce fruit, and to impregnate 

 its pistil with the pollen of some other species; this is impossible in the 

 present instance, on account of the minuteness of the flower and the parts of 

 fructification. If the hybrid be supposed to be formed naturally, how could the 

 anther dust of a cultivated plant be carried in a sufficient quantity from a garden 

 to produce any effect in the thick woods of the Southern States ? 



Botanists have hitherto been able to detect but few species of Vitis in the 

 United States. Michaux, Elliot and others, reckon but four or five in the whole 

 extent of our country. Rafinesque, by believing in the various follies of the day, 

 and led aside by writings which fell into his hands and by the false statements 

 which he collected from different quarters, made forty-one species of this genus, 

 the most of which he had never seen. Although able to investigate and 

 describe as well as any naturalist of his day, he was led astray by an in- 

 satiable desire of making new species, and appropriating to himself every thing 

 that he saw or even heard of in Natural Science, he gave names to many things 

 which never existed, and furnished accounts of them as if he had had them in 

 his possession. Although his lucubrations are little worthy of notice, I have 

 endeavored to identify as many of these numerous species as possible, and to 

 reduce them to some degree of certainty ; guided as well by what I remember 

 to have seen in his possession, as by the short, and, in many instances, very im- 

 perfect descriptions found in his American Manual of Grape Vines ; some I have 

 not been able to determine, but scarcely think them different from others already 

 well known. The number of species now recognized in systematic works is 

 not more than five or six. I have increased this number considerably ; with 

 what propriety is for others to judge. 



In my wanderings through our country, I have, I think, seen two more species, 

 but have no memoranda of their characteristics which allow me to say more 

 than that one was observed in the middle regions of Georgia, which bore grapes 

 of a tolerably large size, in clusters of such density that the berries were pressed 

 into a cubic form. The other was a small grape, of which the inhabitants of 

 the upper part of North Carolina made a considerable quantity of pale red wine. 

 This may be the V. cordifolia of Michaux, which species I have not been able 

 to determine. The description of the last species, V. palmata, is taken in a 

 great measure from recollection, and not from a late examination. 



By the word racemus or raceme, I wish to be always understood to mean the 

 bunches of mature fruit, the true and legitimate meaning of the Latin word. 



1. Vitis labrusca. Foliis lato-cordatis, sublobato-angulatis, aut quinque- 

 lobatis acuminatis, irregulariter eroso-dentatis, supra glabris, subtus irregulari- 

 ter reticulatis, dense tomentosis aut velutinis, pube incana aut rufescente,

vata, Rafinesque's American Manual of Grape Vines. Vulg. Fox grape, Isa- 

 bella and Catawba grape. 



Stem large and tall. Leaves widely cordate, sublobately-angled or distinctly 

 three or five lobed ; acuminate, irregularly eroso-dentate, above smooth, beneath 

 irregularly reticulate, beneath densely tomentose or velvety ; the pubescence 

 of various length, hoary or rufescent. Berries large, ? of an inch in diameter, 

 round or oval. 



The commonest form of this species has thick leaves, with a rather long 

 pubescence beneath ; the racemes are small, rarely with more than five or six 

 berries on each; these are round, often oblate, black or red colored, acid and 

 austere, frequently occasioning soreness of the lips and fauces of those who eat 

 them. Another variety much cultivated under the names of Isabella, Catawba, 

 and twenty other unmeaning names, has the leaves thinner, the pubescence un- 

 derneath much shorter and more velvety, the racemes large, long and dense, the 

 berries more or less oval, red or black, very sweet and agreeable to the taste, 

 with a peculiar flavor, by some called musky. This is much cultivated in sonne 

 parts of the Union, and wine of a fine quality is made from it. But like all the 

 grapes of America the fruit is so watery that it is thought necessary to add sugar 

 to the must, not considering that the must before fermentation can be made of 

 any strength with regard to the sugar contained in it, by boiling, as is done in 

 some parts of the country with apple and pear juice. 



The best of all the varieties of this species is the w'hite fruited, which does 

 not differ in its leaf from that first described ; the rncennes are, however, large, 

 long and dense, the berries white or green with a slight coppery tinge on the 

 side exposed to the sun. It is, perhaps, the best grape indigenous to America 

 which has been found in the Northern States. It is very sweet, and has but 

 little of the peculiar flavor which almost all the others have, and is entirely free 

 from all acridity. 



2. V. TENUiFOLiA. Foliis tenuibus, lato-cordatis simplicibus, trilobis aut 

 quinquelobis acuminatis irregulariter dentatis, glabris interdum siibtus arach- 

 noideo-villosis, nervis rufo-pubescentibus. Racemis parvis,baccis magnis, rotun- 

 dis, viridibus paulo glaucescentibus, ingratis acidis. 



Hah. In New Jersey, formerly very common in the vicinity of Trenton, but 

 now not to be found. 



Stem tolerably large and tall; leaves thin, widely cordate, simple or three or 

 five lobed: acuminate, irregularly dentate, smooth, sometimes arachnoideo- 

 villous beneath ; the nerves and veins always furnished with a rufous pubescence. 

 Racemes small, berries large, '8 of an inch in diameter, green, a little glaucous, 

 disagreeably acid. 



3. V. jESTiVALis. Foliis lato-cordatis sublobato-angulatis, tri vel quinquelobis, 

 acuminatis irregulariter serratis aut dentatis, dentibus mucronatis, supra glabris 

 aut paulo arachnoideis, subtus arachnoideo-villosis plus minus fuscis, interdum 

 subglabris, junioribus densius villosis. Racemis parvis, baccis parvulis nigris 

 acidis. 



Hub. In Carolina and Georgia. V. aestivalis, Michaux and Rafinesque. V. 

 labrusca, Walter and Elliot. Vulg. Fox grape. 



Stem large and lofty; leaves widely cordate, sublobately angled, sometimes 

 distinctly and deeply three and five lobed ; acuminate irregularly dentate or ser- 

 rate, with the teeth mucronate, above smooth or a little arachnoidal, especially 

 in the younger state, beneath more or less fuscous, arachnoideo-villous, some- 

 times subglabrous, the youngest one more densely villous. Racemes rather small; 

 berries rather small, '4 of an inch in diame'er, black, generally very acid. 



These three species have a general resemblance to each other, but, as appears 

 from the descriptions, are sufliciently distinct. 



4. V. BRACTEATA. Foliis cordatis, acuminatis, quinquelobis, sinubis latis 

 profundis, irregnlariter dentatis dentibus acutis muticis, supra glabris, subtns 

 nervis rufo-pubescentibus. Florum fasciculis bracteatis. Racemis longis com-

272 [February, 



Hah. In Carolina and Georgia in swamps. V. bracteata, Raf. V. aestivalis, 

 Elliot. Vulg. Duck shot or Swamp grape. 



Stem'very large, climbing to the Tops of the loftiest trees ; leaves broad-cor- 

 date, acuminate, five-lobed, sinuses wide and deep, the lobes irregularly dentate ; 

 the teeth without any mucronate point, above smooth, beneath with the nerves 

 rufo-pubescent. Fascicles of the flowers with a short leaf or bract at the base 

 of each; racemes long, loose, and compound; berries very small, '15 of an inch 

 in diameter, very acid. 



5. V. vuLPiNA. Foliis glabris, cordatis acuminatis, simplicibus, trilobis aut 

 interdum profunde quinquelobis, dentatis, dentibus subabrupte-acurainatis, sub- 

 tus plus minus sparse villosiusculis aut etiam glabris. ^acemis densis baccis 

 parvis. 



Hah. In the Northern and Middle States. V. vulpina, Willd. V. aestivalis, 

 Emerson's Report on the Trees, &c., of Massachusetts. V. cordifolia of many 

 authors, but not of Michaux. V. callosa, byemalis, cordifolia, Raf. Vulg. Winter 

 grape. 



Stem moderately large, very branching, the younger shoots for the most part 

 purplish. Leaves always smooth above, and generally so on both sides ; be- 

 neath sometimes, particularly in the younger ones, a little villous ; cordate 

 acuminate dentate, the teeth abruptly acuminate, always more or less tri-lobate, 

 sometimes profoundly so, and often five-lobed. Racemes tolerably large, very 

 dense, so as even to change the form of the berries ; berries -35 of an inch in 

 diameter, black, acid. 



The name of cordifolia is occasionally given improperly to another species, 

 the V. rotundifolia Mx. Willdenow's description is not very full, but suffi- 

 ciently so to remove all doubt of his meaning this species ; there is no other 

 so well deserving the name of Vulpina, as the grapes have a strong smell much 

 resembling that of a fox. 



The older leaves are without any villosity beneath except on the nerves, 

 which with the veins are very prominent. They frequently become glaucous 

 beneath. 



6. V. ARA.NE0SUS. Foliis lato-cordatis, sublobato-angulatis, integris, trilobis aut 

 quinquelobis, lobis acuminatis, dentatis, dentibus submucronatis, supra glabris, 

 subtus arachnoideo-villosis, villositate plus minus ferruginea. Racemis subden- 

 sis, baccis majoribus nigris. 



Hab. In the upper parts of Georgia. Vulg. Fox grape. 



Stem moderately large and high. Leaves broad, cordate, sublobately angled, 

 entire and three or five lobed, acuminate dentate ; the teeth submucronate, above 

 glabrous, beneath arachnoideo-villous, more or less ferruginous ; in the older 

 leaves this villosity forms into small tufts or knots, and in the very oldest 

 almost entirely vanishes, although in the youngest it is very thick and close. 

 Racemes dense; berries of a middling size, -5 of an inch in diameter, black, often 

 very sweet and agreeable. The leaves are sometimes 8 inches long and as 

 many wide. 



This species is well worth cultivating. 



7. V. BicoLOR. Foliis lato-cordatis sublobato-angulatis acuminatis subintegris 

 et tri aut quinquelobis irregulariter dentatis, dentibus acuminatis aut mucronatis 

 supra glabris subtus paliidioribus, in junioribus sparse arachnoideo-villosis. 

 Racemis laxis, baccis parvis nigris. 



Hab. From Pennsylvania to Virginia. V. aestivalis Darlington, Florula 

 Cestrica. 



Stem moderately large and high. Leaves broad-cordate, sublobately angled 

 acuminate, subentire, and three or five-lobed, irregularly dentate ; the teeth 

 acuminate or mucronate, above smooth ; beneath paler in the younger leaves, 

 sparsely arachnoideo-villous, the villosity entirely vanishing with age. Ra- 

 cemes long, loose and compound ; berries small, black, -3 of an inch in diameter, 

 sweet and agreeable.

8. V. PULLARiA. Foliis elabris, ovatis cordatis acuminatis, ut plurimum 

 versus apicem obscure aut profunde trilobatis rarius quinque lobatis saepe inte- 

 gris, inaequaliter gross dentatis, dentibus acuminatis. Racemis longis ramosis 

 laxis. 



Hab. In Virginia and Maryland. Vulg. Ctiicken grape. 



Stem miderately large and tall. Leaves thin, smooth on both sides, polished, 

 ovate cordate abruptly acuminate, beyond the middle more or less tri-lobed, 

 sometimes five-lobed, often entire, unequally dentate ; teeth large, acuminate ; 

 petioles and nerves beneath conspicuouslypubescent. Racemes long, compound 

 and loose ; berries small, -3 of an inch in diameter. 



9. V. RiPARiA. Foliis elabris ovatis cordatis acuminatis ante medium plus 

 minus trilobis, saepe integris dentatis, dentibus latis depressis, brevi-mucronatis. 

 Racemis laxis baccis parvis. 



Hab. In Georgia and Mississippi on the banks of rivers in overflov\'ed places. 

 V. riparia Mx. V. dimidiata Rafinesque. 



Stem lariie and tall. Leaves thin, smooth on both sides, polished ovate, cor- 

 date, acuminate, more or less tri-lobed beyond the middle, often entire, sub- 

 crenato-dentate ; teeth broad, flat, with a short point; the youngest leaves with 

 a slight arachnoid pubescence beneath, petioles, nerves and margin pubescent. 

 The leaves are sometimes five-lobed, the upper lobes with deep spathuliform 

 sinuses, the margin but little dentate. Racemes loose; berries small, -3 of an 

 inch in diameter, black and acid. 



This species, confounded by most authors with the next (if it has ever been 

 seen by them,) is found only in the southernmost States on the margins of 

 rivers, in places frequently subject to inundation, whence its name among the 

 inhabitants of the banks of the Mississippi, Vigne de battures ; it very much re- 

 sembles the next, but is easily distinguished by its thinner leaves and the 

 arachnoid pubescence on the under side of them in their younger state. 



10. V. oDORATissiMA. FoUis glabris ovatis cordatis acuminatis inaequaliter 

 crenato-dentatis dentibus' mucronatis, ut plurimum versus apicem obscure trilobis. 

 Racemis laxis, baccis parvis. 



Hab. In the Northern States, in dry situations, generally on the sides of rocky 

 hills. V. odoratissima Donn. V. riparia Pursh, Torrey and Gray, &c. V. 

 serotina Bartram, 1. c seems to be V. cordifolia of Emerson, &c. V. montana, 

 concolor, columbina, populifoka, odoratissima and amara Rafinesque. 



Stem large and high. Leaves smooth on both sides, broad-ovate, cordate, 

 acuminate, unequally crenato-dentate, teeth mucronate ; generally obscurely trilo- 

 bate beyond the middle, nerves beneath very prominent, margin, nerves beneath 

 and petioles pubescent ; a small pubescent tuft on the axillae of the nerves of the 

 under side of the leaves. Racemes long and loose, berries small, '2 of an inch 

 in diameter, black, very acid and austere, ripening in November, 



This species is much cultivated in gardens on account of its fragrant flowers, 

 the perfume of which is exactly that of Reseda odorata. It very rarely pro- 

 duces fruit. I have found fertile individuals only on the rocky hills north of 

 Hoboken, New Jersey. I have been informed that the Indians formerly used 

 the juice of this grape for dyeing blue. 



11. V. ROTUNDiFOLiA. FoUis glabris nitidis rotundo-cordatis, acuminatis 

 nunquam lobatis grosse dentatis, dentibus acutis subaequalibus, racemis parvis 

 baccis magnis nigris, rubescentibus vel albis. 



Hab. From Virginia to Florida. V. rotundifolia Mx. V. vulpina Walter. 

 V. acerifolia, vulpina, angulata, and veruccosa Rafinesque. Vulgo, BuUace 

 grape, from its resemblance to the bullace or wild plum of Europe, corrupted into 

 Bull grape. In Virginia and North Carolina, it is called Muscadine and 

 Scuppernon grape. 



Stem moderately large, unlike every other species perfectly smooth even in 

 the oldest vines. Leaves thin, smooth on both sides, polished, shining, most so 

 beneath, round cordate, never lobed, acuminate dentate ; teeth large, subequal, 

 acute, axillae of the nerves beneath sometimes furnished with a small tuft of 




274 [February, 



pubescence. Racemes small, simple ; berries large, -2 of an inch in diameter, 

 round, black, reddish or white. 



This vine most frequently produces fruit of a delicious flavor and very sweet. 

 In North Carolina much wine is made from the grapes, but generally it is spoilt by 

 mixing it with peach brandy or whiskey to increase its strength. Among the 

 ignorant it is commonly thought that no fermented juice of fruit can be kept for 

 any length of time, unless it is adulterated with alcoholic spirit. 



In the pine forests of Georgia the V. rotundifolia is found prostrate, with stems 

 scarcely three feet long. 



12. V. PALAiATA. Foliis ovato-cordatis utrinque glabris, profunde quinque 

 lobatis palmatis, laciniis sublanceolatis, inaequaliter lateque crenatis vel incisis. 

 Racemis subdensis subsimplicibus baccis magiiis albis gena cupraea. 



Hab. In North Carolina and oil the banks of the Ohio. V. palmata Vahl. 

 V. virginiana Poiret. 



This grape, which is the true Bland's grape of former years, was once (30 

 years ago,) extensively cultivated in the gardens of this city, but has since been 

 utterly lost. I cannot now find a single plant of it. It was perfectly hardy, 

 bore profusely and ripened before the frosts. 



The above description is made from memory assisted by Vahl's and Poiret's 

 descriptions. I have seen it growing wild in the mountains of North Carolina 

 and have been informed that it was once common on the banks of the Ohio 

 river. There is certainly no grape found in America that can be compared 

 with it ; in every respect it is equal to any variety of the V. vinifera, being 

 very sweet and perfectly free from pulp, and without that peculiar flavor which 

 is more or less common to all other American species. 



The V. cordifolia Mx. I have never met with, at least a species correspond- 

 ing with his description has never fallen in my way either in the North or South. 

 It is said to extend from Pennsylvania to Florida. There is another small and 

 sweet grape called the Orwigsburg which I have omitted, although said to be 

 native ; I could never satisfy myself that it was so. It has much the appearance 

 of foreign varieties. 



Of the foregoing species, those most worthy of cultivation are of No. 1, the 

 white variety, and the Isabella or Catawba, which would probably flourish in the 

 coldest parts of Europe; No. 6 and No. 11 and No. 12, all of which are sweet and 

 agreeable and furnish good wine.

 can Siphales," and '^ Synopsis of the Scaphidilia of the United States," 

 reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings. 



Synopsis of the Silphales of America^ North of Mexico, 

 By John L. Le Conte, M. D. 



In the following synopsis, I have included also the Coleoptera which form 

 Erichson's family Ariisotomini, as the characters of that group appear to be by 

 no means sufficient to entitle it to rank as a distinct family. Schiodte has al- 

 ready* made similar remarks, detailing at the same time, strong reasons in sup- 

 port of his opinion. 



The genus Silpha presents among its species peculiarities which would furnish 

 abundant material for reflection to the philosophic naturalist; the species found 

 in this country, diff'er among themselves, by such variations of structure that 

 each becomes the type of a separate group. Several authors have already 

 designated many of these groups by generic names, yet the diff"erences between 

 them appear in value so much less than those which distinguish the genera,

 mological Society of London, New Series, vol. 1, p. 134, et seq.

which have an appearance of being truly natural, that 1 ha^6t considered it 

 prudent to adopt their views. ^^'rv^rrifSr?^*^ ' 



Among some of these groups, (e. g. S. lapponica, S. americana and S. ramosa,) 

 appear several forms, which are undeniably distinct in their origin and distribu- 

 tion and yet do not present characters sufficiently definite for their perfect 

 separation. Many genera among more highly organized animals presenting 

 this same peculiar specific relation will occur to the mind of every naturalist, 

 but this is, I believe, the first example distinctly noticed among Articulata ; 

 nor can 1 find in scientific memoirs any allusion to a doctrine, which flows very 

 naturally from such observations, viz : There are in nature genera so constituted 

 that their division can naturally be made only so as to exhibit assemblages of 

 individuals, which are multiple and distinct in their origin, but which are so 

 closely related that any attempt to define and isolate them must result in con- 

 fusion. The interpretation of so called geographical varieties, is obviously a 

 portion of this doctrine ; but for the present, I must merely content myself with 

 this brief notice of a view, which, whether it be eventually proved correct or 

 erroneous, might ere this have exerted a beneficial influence upon certain por- 

 tions of Natural History, where The zeal for creating irrecognisable species has 

 been pushed to a prodigious extent.

Southern States, Missouri Territory and Texas. This very distinct species 

 diff'ers from all the succeeding ones by the epipleurae being narrower, less in- 

 flexed, and less distinctly margined above. The posterior tibiae are very much 

 dilated at their extremity. In the male, the anterior tarsi are only moderately 

 dilated, and the yellow hair at the base of the abdomen is more abundant. In 

 both sexes the rhinarium is triangular. 



Among the specimens from Nebraska are varieties in which the anterior 

 transverse spot is divided; in some the outer part of this divided spot is efiaced ; 

 in such individuals the posterior lunate spot is much reduced in size.

One female from Nebraska and another from Utah. Very similar in appear- 

 ance to the preceding, but the anterior band does not reach the suture, and the 

 posterior band is less close to the apex; the rhinarium in both specimens is 

 black and triangular. 



Kirby describes his species as having a red trapezoidal rhinarium, but as I 

 find great differences in this respect between individuals of other species, I am 

 not inclined to consider this character as of any importance. Kirby's descrip- 

 tions are moreover very faulty and difficult to use, as he has laid undue stress 

 on variable or on universal characters, while the differences in form of the 

 thorax and the extent of its depressed portion are hardly mentioned. 



The description ofN. obscurus Kirby (1. c. 97,) also applies to this 

 species, except that the epipleurae are not " narrower than usual ;" that char- 

 acter would assimilate it with my division (A), but from the want of a descrip-

 tarsi of the male are dilated, and the rhinarium is black and trapezoidal ; in the 

 female the rhinarium is much smaller and triangular; the anus of both sexes is 

 ciliate with j^ellow hairs.

The rhinarium in this species is red, and very variable in form ; sometimes it 

 is small and triangular, sometimes very large and trapezoidal. This difference 

 at first appeared to be sexual, but with a larger series of specimens I found 

 that both forms were to be found among the males ; although the variation is 

 very great, yet after a diligent comparison, nothing was found to indicate spe- 

 cific difference.

New York<ind Lake Superior. I have only males of this species ; of three 

 from Lake Superior, the smallest has the rhinarium large, trapezoidal and 

 black ; in the other two no rhinarium is visible. The impressions of the thorax 

 are very deep, the longitudinal line is more distinct than usual; the red band of 

 the elytra, although reaching the lower margin of the epipleura, is not dilated 

 there. 



The specimen from New York differs from the other three in having the 

 elytra more finely punctured, and the red bands much more bright colored; the 

 rhinarium is large and trapezoidal, as in the first mentioned specimen. 



I formerly considered the large specimens as N. hebes Kirby, (1. c 96,) 

 which by description seems closely allied, but is placed in a different division 

 of the genus, with the "prothorax dilated anteriorly."

 reddish; the punctures of the elytra are furnished with tolerably long erect 

 yellowish hairs ; the tibiae are nearly straight; the posterior ones of the male 

 are gradually broadly dilated towards the tip. 



One male from the Sault de Sainte Marie, Michigan, differs in having glabrous 

 elytra, and much more dilated posterior tibiae ; the rhinarium in it is piceous, 

 broad and trapezoidal. The hairs of the elytra may have been removed by 

 accident, and the other characters seem scarcely sufficient for the definition of a 

 new species.

 sexes ; the former 1 have observed only in males. The club of the antennae 

 is black. 



As the two names applied to this species appear to be equal in date, I have 

 followed other authors in adopting that of Fabricius, as his work is of a more 

 systematic nature, and much more easily accessible.

The following arrangement of the species is the most natural that I have been 

 able to form ; it must be remembered at the same time, that the intermediate 

 coxae in all our species are moderately distant :

Necrodes sziriiiamensis Latr. Gen. Crust, et Ins. 1, 498. 



Common in the Middle, Southern and Western States. Varies in having a 

 small lateral spot at the middle of the elytra, and sometimes a small discoidal 

 one between the 2d and 3d costa. The posterior thighs of the male are very 

 much incrassated, and armed beneath with a sharp tooth ; the posterior tibiae are 

 also much curved, and dilated internally towards the apex into an obtuse angle. 



I have excluded the synonym of Kirby, (Fauna Bor. Am. 99,) because the 

 males of his Nova Scotia species are stated to have the posterior thighs very 

 slightly enlarged. This needs confirmation by a re-examination of the original 

 specimens now in the British Museum.

Found in every part of the northern portion of the continent, not extending 

 south of Albany (New York) in the Atlantic States, but in the central region 

 extending into New Mexico, and even into Mexico ; found also in Oregon and at 

 San Diego in Southern California. 



I have only referred to the original description of Herbst, leaving out all the 

 rest of the European synonymy, as it should have no place in a local fauna. 



The elytra of the males vary slightly in form, being sometimes truncate, and 

 sometimes slightly sinuate ; those of the female are more deeply sinuate at the 

 extremity, and are more or less prolonged at the suture ; the anter4or tarsi are 

 slightly dilated in the males. 



The differences upon which are founded the various synonyms above quoted, 

 are entirely individual : they are all found intermixed together wherever the 

 species occurs.

 Northern, Middle and Southern States; the differences between Kirby's species 

 appear to be partly individual and partly sexual ; specimens presenting the cha- 

 racters of all his species occur together. 



There is, however, a particular form which appears to be confined to the 

 Southern States, which perhaps is sufficiently distinct to rank as a species ; from 

 the proportions of Catesby's figure, it is probably his typical insect; in which 

 case the name Americaiia may be retained for the ordinary form, by those who 

 wish to consider them as distinct. 



The variety in question is larger and much broader than those found at the 

 North ; the sides of the thorax are less rounded, and the surface more densely 

 and coarsely punctured. The suture of the female is armed with a more distinct 

 spine ; the horizontal portion of the epipleurae is broader and not so much 

 deflexed. 



In regard to the change of name proposed above, I will merely observe that 

 Catesby appears to have been the first describer of this species, and that his 

 specific name has fallen into disuse, on account of the error committed by Lin- 

 naeus in quoting Catesby's work; as this error has remained uncorrected so long, 

 we are at liberty to infer that subsequent authors have merely quoted Linnasus, 

 without verifying his assertion. 



Although by the change here proposed, a well known name is sacrificed to one 

 completely unknown, it seems to me that there could be no good reason for re- 

 fusing to replace the earlier name, which has been lost, not by forgetfulness nor 

 by ignorance, but simply by a perpetuated misquotation.

Wisconsin, Minnesota, Missouri Territory, New Mexico, Oregon and Cali- 

 fornia. In this widely distributed species, I have been able to distinguish three 

 forms, which though differing by more decided characters than are usually to be 

 found in varieties, can scarcely be considered in the light of ordinary species. 



. The color is dull black; the thorax is very much narrowed in front, and 

 more strongly rounded on the sides than in the others ; the margin of the elytra 

 is broader and less reflexed ; in the male, the elytra are broadly rounded poste-

riorly ; in the female they are prolonged and obliquely narrowed, so that the 

 body appears somewhat ovate. Of this form I have one female, from Fort 

 Snelling (Minnesota) and another from Wisconsin ; one male from Nebraska and 

 one from Oregon. 



(i. Of this form I have only a single female specimen from California ; the 

 body is elliptical, narrower than (et), the thorax not so short; the margin of the 

 elj'tra broad and strongly reflexed, the apex obliquely narrowed as in the pre- 

 ceding, but not longer than the abdomen ; the slight tubercle on each elytron be- 

 hind the middle is more apparent. Color greenish black. 



y. Color greenish black. Form regularl)' elliptical, narrower than the males 

 referred to (at); thorax not so short, less narrowed in front; elytra broadly 

 "rounded behind in both sexes, margin narrower than in the others, and strongly 

 reflexed. Very abundant in California. 



Besides these, I have two specimens which cannot be classed with any of the 

 above, and perhaps indicate other forms, which, however, cannot at present be 

 distinctly separated. 



The first is from Nebraska. It is a dull black male, having the thorax less 

 rarrowed in front than (a), and the margins of the elytra narrower, as in (^), 

 but less reflexed. The proportions of the body are as in the male of (). 



The second was found at San Diego, with {y) ; it is a greenish black female of 

 more dilated form, having the proportions of the male of (a), and having the 

 elytra broadly rounded, as in (^), the margin, however, appears less strongly 

 reflexed than in that form ; the tubercle of the elytra behind the middle, is more 

 obvious than in {a^ or {y). 



1 hese forms appear to be subject also to considerable variation in the sculp- 

 ture of the elytra; the punctures between the branching elevated lines are 

 sometimes very distinct, and sometimes almost obsolete. 



The following is unknown to me : 



Oiceoptoma {Thanatophihcs) tritubercu latum Kirby, Fauna Bor. 

 Am. 101. 



Found in lat. 54*. With this is probably identical the * Silpha opaca Atict.^ of 

 White, in Richardson's Arctic Expedition (p. 474). Whether Kirby's insect is 

 in reality distinct from the European S. opac a Linn., or is related to it as the 

 forms of S. r a m o s a are to each other, must be left for future investigation.

San Francisco, in decomposing human excrements. Nothing in Mannerheim's 

 description, or Chevrolat's figure and description, indicates any difference be- 

 tween Sitka specimens and those found by me, although a direct comparison 

 ought to be made in order to establish their identity. 



Motschulsky, (Bull. Mosc. 1845, p. 363,) states that what is considered as a 

 black variety of this species, is distinct, and thereupon names it N. at e r; with 

 liis accustomed haste, he leaves the distinctive characters to be determined by 

 any individual who is so lucky as to possess such rarities ; as few have had access 

 to species from Russian America, an expression of opinion upon this matter 

 might be dangerous ; for those, however, who would prefer adopting the belief 

 that there is but one species, until a second is demonstrated, I may mention 

 that the species found by me varies from piceous to black, and that there is no 

 other difference between differently colored individuals.

New York. I am not positively certain that this is Say's species, which was 

 found in Arkansas. The thorax is more narrowed in front than described by 

 him; although the legs are in reality black, the lustre of the fulvous hair is 

 such, that one might readily be tempted to describe them as testaceous at base. 



The anterior tarsi and first joint of the middle tarsi of the male are moder-

 are subacute ; the sides are broadly rounded ; the disc is sometimes blackish, 

 and the sides dark rufous. The punctures of the upper surface in this species 

 are very indistinct, and the transverse striae very fine ; the pubescence is seri- 

 ceous, but not dense. The anterior tarsi of the male are strongly dilated, the 

 intermediate pair simple, the posterior pair longer than the tibiae.

Very abundant at the mouth of the Pic River, on the north side of Lake 

 Superior, under dried animal matter. This species is broader and less convex 

 than the preceding, and is easily known by the more distinct punctuation, and 

 by the absence of the transverse lines. The thorax is densely and finely punc- 

 tulate, it is about twice as wide as its length, strongly narrowed in front, 

 rounded on the sides, especially anteriorly, sligh^y emarginate at apex, trun- 

 cate at base, and very slightly sinuate at the posterior angles, which are scarcely 

 perceptibly acute. The anterior tarsi of the male, and the first joint of the

 the tibiae slightly spinous, or merely pubescent. This arrangement does not ap- 

 pear altogether natural, as some of the species of Liodes have the spines of the 

 tibiae very distinct, while others have the same organs nearly smooth. Possibly 

 a more natural division might be into three groups, thus : 



A. Clypeus parvus capite connatus, vel vix distinctus ; caput subtus non 

 insculptum. 



B. Clypeus valde distinctus : caput subtus non insculptum. 



C. Clypeus nuUus : caput subtus sulcis profundis insculptum. 



The first group corresponds to Erichson's Anisotomini : the second contains 

 Liodes, and probably Amphicyllis : the third contains Agathidium only. The 

 first division is said by Erichson (Ins. Deutschl. 44) to be almost peculiar to 

 Europe : it will be seen, however, that it is quite respectably represented in this 

 country.

One specimen, found on the north shore of Lake Superior. The anterior tibiae 

 are as in the preceding, the posterior ones are straight and not longer than the 

 others. Kirby says that the interstices of the elytra are smooth, and they really 

 appear so, except under a powerful lens : a new examination of Kirby's type 

 must, however, be made before they can be considered as identical.

One specimen from Eagle Harbor. This species is remarkable for the sculp- 

 ture of the elytra; the punctures of the interstitial spaces are almost invisible, 

 and are usually placed in the transverse scratches ; the sutural stria is deeply im- 

 pressed posteriorly. By its sculpture this species is nearly related to A.

 tinctly punctured thorax.

 used by him was not sufficient to enable the specific characters to be clearly 

 perceived.

Two specimens from Habersham county, Georgia. This species agrees in 

 every particular with the description of C.latipes Er., (Deutschl. Ins. 80) 

 except that the thorax is more distinctly punctured at the sides ; the sutural stria 

 is impressed from the middle of the el3'^tra to the tip. The posterior femora of 

 the male are armed beneath, at the extremity, with a very large, slightly re- 

 curved tooth, as in C. latipes. 



The insect described by me in Agassiz' Lake Superior, as Cyrtusa

Two specimens, found in Pennsylvania, were given me by Mr. Ziegier, a 

 much smaller one was found by me in upper Georgia ; as the posterior thighs aie 

 alike in all, they are probably females. This species will be easily distinguished 

 from the European C. d e n t i p e s Er., (Deutschl. Ins. 83) by the thorax being 

 smooth and shining, even when viewed with a Stanhope lens, and by the entire 

 absence of punctures on the elytra. 



The genus will be easily distinguished by the seventh joint of the antennae 

 being but little larger than the 8th, so that the club appears 3-jointed, the third 

 joint is as long as the second ; the middle and posterior tarsi are four-jointed. 



2. C ? 1 aev i s , globosa, nigra, nitida lasvis, thorace margine omni diaphano,

 terno medio nigro. Long. -04. 



Georgia. I considered this little insect as anon-globatile Agathidium, but on 

 relaxing a specimen and examining the antennas it appears to belong to this genus ; 

 the club of the antennae is, however, more slender than in the preceding, so that 

 the seventh joint really appears to enter into the club. The third to the sixth 

 joints are equal in length. The anterior margin of the front is broadly rounded, 

 as in the preceding genus. The mesosternum is strongly carinate. I cannot be 

 absolutely certain that the posterior tarsi are not 3-jointed, in which case it 

 would be necessary to place it in Agaricophagus ; the tibiae are apparently with- 

 out spines. 



The head is fully one-half as wide as the base of the thorax, and black, with 

 the mouth yellowish. The thorax is very short, deeply emarginate in front, 

 slightly rounded on the sides, broadly rounded at the base; the sides and basal 

 margin are diaphanous and yellowish. The elytra are entirely without striae or 




1853.]

punctures, their tip is rufescent. The under side of the body and the feet are 

 rufous ; the metasternum has a large central black spot. 



It is very probable that the relation between the second joint of the antennae 

 and the following- ones should be considered as a generic character, and the ab- 

 sence of all sculpture on the upper surface would seem to indicate a genus dis- 

 tinct both from Colenis and Agaricophagus. Until more specimens occur, so 

 that a dissection can be made, it would be better to allow the species to rest in 

 the present genus.

San Jose, California, under oak bark. The elytra are finely punctulate; the

 commences at the humerus, and becoming narrower, runs obliquely backwards, 

 nearly reaching the suture about the middle; the second spot commences below 

 the humerus, and forms a broad vitta parallel with the margin, and not reaching 

 the suture ; the thorax is sometimes black margined with yellow, sometimes yel- 

 low with a round discoidal black spot ; the club of the antennae is piceous, be- 

 coming rufous at its extremity. 



The left mandible of the male is armed with a long curved horn.

Phalacrus difformis Le Conte, Agassiz' Lake Superior, 222. 



Two males from the north side of Lake Superior. The left mandible is armed 

 with a long curved horn. The head is distinctly punctured ; the base of the an- 

 tennae, and the anterior feet are rufo-piceous ; the margins of the elytra are 

 rufescent. 



I have nothing to say in extenuation of my error in placing this species in the 

 genus Phalacrus, the form of the anterior coxae, and the filiform tarsi, if looked 

 at, would have taught me better. 



The genus Sternuchus Lee, (Agass. Lake Sup. 222) must be suppressed, 

 as, on careful examination, I find the club of the antennae to be two-jointed ; the 

 part described by me as the antennae of Sternuchus, appears to be an accidentally 

 adhering fragment of another insect. There, therefore, remains no character to 

 separate Sternuchus from Clambus, and the typical species must be called 

 Clambus gibbulus; it is the analogue of the European C. armadillo ; a 

 slightly pubescent species found in Pennsylvania was given me by Mr. Ziegler. 

 The genus Clambus, from the appearance of the under surface, may probably 

 enter the family Trichopterygia, but as yet its place seems uncertain. 



As an appendix to the present family, it may be proper to describe an insect 

 which is placed in many American cabinets under the name * Sphaerites america- 

 nus.' It is, however, by no means a Sphaerites, nor does it belong to the present 

 family, but from its transverse anterior coxae, entire prosternum, &c., &c., must 

 be placed in the family Nitidulariae, where it forms a new genus.

The form of the body is very similar to that of Hister ; it is glabrous, elliptical, 

 and moderately convex ; the elytra are truncate, so as to expose the last dorsal 

 segment ; the male has an additional small anal segment. The anterior tibiae are 

 more dilated than the others ; their outer margin is finely serrulate, and the outer 

 angle somewhat produced ; the terminal spurs are unequal, the larger ones 

 slightly bent; the prosternum is dilated and rounded posteriorly ; the middle coxae 

 are distant. The first ventral segment is larger than the others. 



By this detail of the characters, this genus will appear obviously different 

 from any described by Erichson in his systematic arjangement of Nitidulariae, 

 (Germar's Zeitschr. 4, 267 et seq.) ; it seems to approach most closely Ischsena, 

 (p. 287,) and Ipidia (p. 289.)

i?2/nopsis of the species of the Histeroid genus Abr^eus (Leach,) inhabiting Hie 

 United States, with descriptions of tico nearly allied new genera* 



By John L. Le Conte, M. D. 



The number of species of Abraeus found within our territory, renders the 

 genus quite worthy of a special notice ; as they are all very small and uniform 

 in appearance, they present at first a moderate degree of difficulty in determin- 

 ing their characters. This difficulty, however, vanishes under a closer inspec- 

 tion, which show's the species to be as well defined as in other genera of the same 

 family. For the more complete illustration of the genus, I have added descrip- 

 tions of two species from Cuba ; these being foreign to our present limits, are 

 not numbered in the following list. 



Two species, which I considered as belonging to this genus, on close examin- 

 ation present characters altogether different. 1 have accordingly constructed a 

 new aenus for them, which must be placed in a different division of the family, 

 near Dendrophilus. To avoid confusion, however, as the species will undoubt- 

 edly be mistaken by others for Abraeus, I have thought it better to append the 

 generic and specific description to the present essay. 



Erichson has divided the six species known to him, into two groups. The 

 first contains globular species, with very short estriate prosternum, with no 

 lateral stria on the elytra, and with the pygidium inflexed, so as to form part of 

 the ventral surface of the abdomen. Of this group there is but one species 

 known to me in this country. 



The second group has the prosternum. bistriate, the elytra with a lateral stria 



44 




288 ' [February, 



and the pygidium perpendicular. The species are, numerous and vary in form 

 from almost globular to tolerably strongly depressed. 



A synoptic table may be thus constructed : 



A. Corpus globosum, pygidio inflexo. Abr^us. 

 1. rufus, elytris valde aciculatis, linea basali hamata insculptis punctiformis. 

 B. Pygidium perpendiculariter deflexum. Acritus.

 aciculatis, linea basali hamata notatis, pygidio inflexo, punctato. Long. '02. 



Common in the Southern States, under pine bark. I have adopted the name 

 under which it has been sent me by Dr. Zimmerman. Body subglobose, very 

 little longer than wide, rufous, somewhat shining ; head and thorax finely punc- 

 tured, the latter not margined at the base. Elytra strongly aciculate, marked 

 on each side with a basal curved line, of a parabolic form ; the outer leg of this 

 curve may be traced quite to the apex, forming a fine marginal line ; the epi- 

 pleura? and imder surface of the body are very coarsely punctured. Pygidium 

 strongly inflexed, punctured. Anterior tibiae strongly dilated. 



The prostcrnum is punctured, slightly emarginate behind, and not striate. 



Acritus Lrc. 



Prosternum utririque truncatum, bistriatum ; mandibulne retract ; scrobiculi 

 antennales maximi profundi, in thoracis parte inflexa antice siti : antennae funi- 

 culo tenui, capitulo ovali; maxillae mala interiore unco apicali armata; tarsi 

 postici quadriarticulati; pygidium perpendiculare. 



Although by Erichson considered as a portion of Abra^us, I have ventured to 

 separate these species as a distinct genus, since the characters already pointed 

 out by Redtenbacher (Fauna Austr. 240) in the form of the posterior tarsi and 

 the inner lobe of the maxillae seem to indicate the necessity of removing these 

 species from Abraeus. 



In the form of the antennae and the cavities for their reception, this genus 

 agrees perfectly with Abraeus ; the prosternum is, however, less flat, and is 

 truncate posteriorly as well as in front ; it is marked with a distinct stria on 




1853.] 289 



each side. The elytra are destitute of a marginal stria; the epipleurae have a 

 single entire lateral stria, and occasionally a rudiment of a second at the base. 

 The pygidium is perpendicular, not inflexed, as in Abra3us. The anterior tibice 

 are more or less dilated, but always gradually so. The middle and posterior 

 tibias are slender. The posterior tarsi are only four-jointed, the portion usually 

 composing the basal joint being firmly anchylosed to the second joint. 



To this genus will also belong Hister minutus Fubr., and Hister nigricornis 

 E/it. Heft., both placed in Abraeus by Erichson.

 base. Elytra finely and tolerably densely punctured, very slightly aciculate ; 

 epipleurae broad, finely punctulate, lateral stria deep. Pygidium impunctured ;

Abrceiis fimetarlus Lee, Bost. Journ. Nat. Hist. 5, 54. 



A pretty large species, found in the Southern and Middle States, in dung and 

 under stones. Head very finely punctulate. Thorax not densely, very finely 

 punctured, with a transverse marginal line at the middle of the base. Elytra 

 not densely, somewhat coarsely punctured, punctures becoming small poste- 

 riorly and intermixed with dense fine scratches ; towards the base there are 

 usually one or two oblique abbreviated striae visible, which, however, are some- 

 times entirely obsolete ; epipleurae inferiorly smooth, lateral stria deep. Pygi- 

 dium impunctured, slightly chagrined. Under surface sparsely punctured; 

 anterior tibiae scarcely dilated. 



A specimen found by Dr. Schaum at New Orleans, has the basal elytral strice 

 very deep, and between them about the middle, is a shorter, also oblique stria. 

 I can find no other difference between it and the others. 



From the difiiculty of perceiving the characters of such minute species, the 

 descriptions of my father are by no means as accurate in this genus as in the 

 others contained in his Monograph. Under this species he says that the thorax 

 is not margined posteriori)^ but has a row of larger punctures. Novv^ in all the 

 species which have the posterior line discernible, it is formed by the limit of a 

 series of basal punctures or aciculations, and is not an engraved distinctly de- 

 fined line.

 posterior rugae more numerous. The lateral stria is very fine. The postpectus 

 is smooth ; with a very powerful lens, and in a particular light, may be seen a 

 i^vj very minute indistinct punctures. Anterior tibiae scarcely dilated.

Gila and Colorado Rivers, California, under the bark of Cottonwood. This 

 species is very similar in form to A. simplex, but is a little less convex. The 

 more distinct punctuation of the thorax and the finely punctulate pygidium 

 will at once distinguish it. The punctures of the elytra are less mixed with 

 rugae posteriorly; the sides and epipleurae are smooth; the lateral stria is fine, 

 and the postpectus is sparsely punctured ; the anterior tibiae are scarcely 

 dilated. 



From A. analis it differs by the less dense and more distinct punctuation, as 

 well as by the less deep lateral stria.

Middle, Southern and Western States, abundant under stones. This species 

 has entirely the form of A. simplex, but is destitute of punctures both above 

 and beneath. The lateral stria is fine but distinct, the anterior tibiae are 

 scarcely dilated. I have distributed this insect under the name A. Iccvigatv.s ; 

 on account of Hister laevigatus Payk. I have thought it better to change this 

 name. Paykull's species is not an Abraeus, as conjectured by my father, but is 

 evidently a species of Caerosternus Lee, and only differs from the Cuban 

 C. laevissimus Lee. (Proceed. Acad. 6, 40,) in having the pectus slightly punc- 

 tured. It has not been seen since Paykull's time, and is probably a West Indian 

 species. Further comparison is necessary to determine whether Caerosternus 

 should not be reunited to Tribalus ; the rounded margin of the prosternum 

 might be called a short broad lobe, while the lateral extension, although not 

 lobed in its outline, might be but a very slight variation of the form described 

 by Erichson.

Abundant in the Southern States, and found also at Fort Laramie, Nebraska. 

 Body oblong, subdepressed. Thorax densely, distinctly punctured, sometimes 

 slightly rugous. Elytra more coarsely punctured, posteriorly more or less 

 aciculate ; lateral stria deep. Postpectus and abdomen coarsely punctured. Py- 

 gidium finely but distinctly punctulate. Feet rufous, anterior tibiee very 

 slightly dilated. 



There is frequently a trace of an oblique stria at the base of the elytra ; the 

 concavity of the epipleur^ in this, as in some other species, causes the lateral 

 stria in some lights to appear double. 



Two specimens, which appear somewhat broader and more depressed than 

 ordinary, form Ahrcsiis ohliquus Lee, but after a very close examination, I can' 

 not find any sufficient distinction. By the thorax in the one described being 

 dislocated, so as to show the posterior edge, it was incorrectly described by my 

 father as margined at the base.

 and densely punctured, punctures somewhat aciculate ; epipleurae / Pygidium 

 finely and obsoletely punctulate ; anterior tibiae not dilated. 



I am not able to make a satisfactory examination of the under surface, but the 

 form, color and punctuation are sufficient to separate it at once from the pre- 

 ceding species, to which alone it is allied.

 penultimis rotundatis, capitulo ovali modice compresso ; pygidium inflexum ; 

 tibiae anticae dilatatoe, posteriores angustae ; tarsi omnes 5-articulati. 



Although from the want of specimens for dissection, 1 am able to give but a 

 meagre description of this genus, the characters above stated will show the ne- 

 cessity of separating it from Abraeus, with which, from the size and form of the 

 body, the species might be confounded. The distinction between this genus and 

 Dendrophilus is however not so well defined ; for the present it can be said, that 

 the prosternum iri Dendrophilus is rounded posteriorly and elevated in the middle 

 and bistriate ; the mesosternum is emarginate ; the middle and posterior tibiae 

 are broadly dilated, and the pygidium is perpendicular. 



Paromalus has the prosternum similar to Dendrophilus. In both the mesos- 

 ternum is emarginate, while in Bacanius it is truncate. 



The species constituting the second division below, ought probably to form a 

 new genus, but the specimen has lost the antennae, and I therefore postpone the 

 farther consideration of the subject till new specimens were obtained.

Chemical Investigation of Kemains of Fossil "Mammalia. 

 By Francis V. Greene, M. D. 



At the request of Dr. F. A. Genth, I have made in his laboratory a chemical 

 investigation of several fossil remains, collected by D. D. Owen, M. D., in his 

 late survey of Nebraska Territory. The specimens, which consisted of a brown 

 portion of bone from a Titanotherium, the enamel and dentine of a tooth of the 

 same animal, and a portion of the tibia of an Archceotherium, were kindly fur- 

 nished me by Dr. Joseph Leidy from the collection of the Academy of Natural 

 Sciences. 



The general outline of the methods pursued in determining the constituents of 

 these specimens is as follows : 



The finely-powdered substance, being always dried over sulphuric acid, was 

 dissolved (according to H. Rose's method for the determination of phosphoric 

 acid) in nitric acid, and after adding mercury in sufficient quantity to combine 

 with the phosphoric acid, it was evaporated to dryness in a water bath. Afterwards 

 it was moistened with water and again evaporated to dryness; this operation being 

 repeated until no odor of nitric acid could be observed at the temperature of the 

 water bath. To this dried mass water was now added. The insoluble portion 

 consisted only of phosphate and basic nitrate of mercury, (except in one analysis, 

 in which iron existed in determinable quantity ;) the solution contained fluoride 

 of mercury and the other constituents as nitrates. This was filtered off", and 

 the insoluble phosphate, after being washed and thcToughly dried, was fused 

 with carbonate of soda, with all the precautions mentioned by Rose. The fused 

 mass, consisting only of phosphate of soda and the excess of carbonate of soda, 

 dissolved therefore completely in water, except in one analysis, in which a por- 

 tion of the iron remaining undissolved, was filtered off and determined in the 

 usual manner. This watery solution was then acidulated with hydrochloric 




1853.1 29 



o 



acid, and the phosphoric acid precipitated in the ordinary way hy sulphate of 



magnesia. 



From the solution containing the soluble nitrates and fluoride of mercury, the 

 mercury was precipitated by chloride of ammonium, and the filtrate from the 

 calomel precipitated by carbonate of ammonia. As carbonate of lime and 

 fluoride of calcium are both slightly soluble in ammoniacal salts, a small quan- 

 tity of each was always deposited on evaporation of the filtrate ; this was sepa- 

 rated by filtration and added to the other portion of carbonate of lime and fluoride 

 of calciuna. This precipitate was ignited, and an excess of acetic acid added, 

 which dissolved the carbonate of lime, leaving the greater portion of the fluoride 

 of calcium ; but, as fluoride of calcium is soluble to a certain extent in acetic 

 acid, the whole was evaporated to dryness to get rid of the free acetic acid, and 

 the dry acetate of lime dissolved in boiling water, and filtered from the insoluble 

 fluoride of calcium. It being found that it always contained a small quantity of 

 silicic acid, the mixture, after being weighed, was treated with hydrochloric 

 acid, which left the silicic acid undissolved, the quantity of which was deter- 

 mined and subtracted from the previous weight, thus leaving the exact weight 

 of the fluoride of calcium. 



The solution from the carbonate of lime containing magnesia and the alkalies, 

 was evaporated to dryness to drive off the ammoniacal salts, and the residue 

 dissolved in sulphuric acid, the excess of which was also driven off" by heat. 

 The dry mass was dissolved in water, and acetate of baryta added to convert 

 the sulphates into acetates. The filtrate from the insoluble sulphate of baryta 

 was then evaporated to dryness in a platinum crucible and heated, in order to 

 convert the acetates of baryta, magnesia and the alkalies into carbonates, which 

 were treated with boiling water, and the soluble alkaline carbonates thus sepa- 

 rated from the insoluble carbonates of magnesia and baryta. This latter mix- 

 ture was then treated with diluted sulphuric acid, and the magnesia afterwards 

 separated from the filtrate as phosphate of magnesia and ammonia. The car- 

 bonates of the alkalies were converted into and weighed as chlorides, and after- 

 wards separated by bichloride of platinum. 



A new portion was taken for the remaining determinations. This was dried 

 at 220 until the weight became constant, the loss giving the quantity of water. 

 The anhydrous substance was then heated in an open crucible until all the or- 

 ganic matter was burned off", and then moistened with carbonate of ammonia, as 

 it was supposed that the high heat maght have expelled a portion of the carbonic 

 acid. The difference of weight gave the quantity of organic matter. The car- 

 bonic acid was determined in the usual manner from the loss of weight after 

 treating with nitric acid. The nitric acid did not dissolve a small quantity of 

 silicic acid, the weight of which was ascertained and added to the other portion. 

 From the filtrate sulphuric acid was precipitated as sulphate of baryta.

The analyses which have already been made show a great similarity of com- 

 position as far as regards the inorganic constituents of fossil and recent bones 

 of mammalia, a fact which receives still farther confirmation from the above 

 analyses. In some few points it will be noticed that the inorganic constitutio)i 

 of these specimens differs from that of analyses already published. This dif- 

 ference may be accounted for by the effects of infiltration, by which a portion 

 of the original substances may have been washed out, whilst its place was sup- 

 plied by extraneous matter. All the analyses show an excess of lime, which

 loss in the analysis was calculated as phosphoric acid.

very probably exists in the form of a basic lime salt, similar to compounds well 

 known in mineralogy. 



In order to test the correctness of the opinion that fossil bones contain fluoride 

 of calcium in larger proportion than recent ones, the fluoride of calcium was 

 determined with the greatest care. In no instance, however, was so large a 

 quantity found as in the analyses of fossil reptiles by Baumert,* where the 

 quantity of fluoride of calcium in the Zeuglodon macrospondylus amounts to 

 9-54 per cent, and in the Hydrarchos even to 16'67 per cent. By direct deter- 

 mination, Heintzf found the quantity of fluoride of calcium in two human bones 

 to be 2*97 and 2-05 per cent ; the former of which corresponds almost exactly 

 with the quantity found in the dentine of Titanotherium. In the tibia of the 

 Archaeotherium, a portion of the fluoride of calcium may have been introduced 

 in the same manner as the quartz and sulphate of baryta.

It is found at McMackin's Mine, Cabarras County, N. C, but rarely, and is 

 associated with Iron Pyrites, Galena, Blende, Talc and Carbonate of Magnesia. 



The sulphur ratio of the sulpho-bases and sulpho-acids is =11.43 : 14.05 



= 1: 1.23 



corresponding with the formula 5 (Ag, Cuj, Zn Fe) S-f-2 (As, Sb) S3. 



I had, as the data of the analysis will show, but a very small quantity of the 

 mineral, and, therefore, although this formula is that of a new mineral, I am un- 

 willing to give it a new name, until more of it will be found, and the analysis 

 repeated ; at present it is preferable to consider it as a variety of gray copper, 

 whose composition is expressed by the formula 4RS4-RS3. 



The following are the methods and data of the analysis : 0.1330 grs. were 

 dissolved in nitro-hydrochloric acid, and the chloride of silver filtered after di- 

 luting with a large quantity of water. It gave 0.0140 grs. metallic silver. The 

 filtrate was evaporated almost to dryness, and heated with sulphite of soda ; and, 

 after in this manner the arsenic acid had been reduced to arsenious acid, the ex- 

 cess of this reagent decomposed by hydrochloric acid. A current of hydro-

sulphuric acid was then passed through the solution, which precipitated sul- 

 phides of copper, of arsenic and of antimony. This precipitate was filtered and 

 treated with sulphide of ammonium. The remaining sulphide of copper was 

 oxydized by nitric acid, and the oxide precipitated by caustic potash. It gave 

 0.0512 grs. 



The solution containing antimony and arsenic was boiled with hydrochloric 

 acid and chlorate of potash, then tartaric acid, an excess of chloride of ammo- 

 nium and ammonia added, and the arsenic acid precipitated by sulphate of mag- 

 nesia as arseniate of magnesia and ammonia. From the quantity of magnesia in 

 this double salt the arsenic was found by calculation. The weight of magnesia 

 was 0.0082 grs. The filtrate from the sulphides of copper, arsenic and antimony 

 was oxydized by nitric acid, and the sesquioxide of iron precipitated by ammo- 

 nia; it was 0.0027 grs. ; the zinc was thrown dowii from the filtrate of iron by 

 sulphide of ammonium, and gave 0.0042 grs. oxide of zinc. 



Sulphur and antimony were determined from the loss, and by calculation.

The name is given in honor of D. D. Owen, M. D., TJ. S. Geologist. 

 The ratio of the oxygen of RO : R^Og : Si03 : HO, is :

The Owenite is closely allied to some other minerals, viz. Aphrosiderite and 

 Thuringite. All three resemble each other very much, and only by chemical 

 examination their difference can be detected. 



Aphrosiderite is a mineral not generally known ; found at several localities 

 in Nassau, and first distinguished from earthy chlorite by Fridolin Sandberger,

who gave an analysis of it in his " Uebersicht der geol. Verhiiltnisse des Herzog- 

 thums Nassau ;" but without calculating its formula. He found that it contains : 



This ratio leads to the formula : 3(3RO, 8103)+ (3 AI2O3, Si03)+6 HO. 

 JBreithaupt's Thurin2;ite is, according to an analysis of Rammelsberg, 3(3RO, 

 Si03)+ (2 FeAj Si03^)-l-9 HO.* 

 These three minerals are therefore : 



Owenite 2(3RO, Si03)4-(3R203 Si03)-l-6HO. 



Aphrosiderite 3(3RO, SiOg) 4- (3AI2 O3, 8103)4-6 HO. 



Thuringite 3(3RO, 8i03)-l-(2 Fe2 O3, SiOg)^ 9 HO. 



The following are the data of Mr. Keyser's analyses, and the methods used 

 for the determination of the different constituents : 



I. 2.0770 Grammes of the mineral gave : 



I. The finely powdered mineral was dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and silica 

 separated in the usual way, with the necessary precautions. In the filtrate the 

 oxide of iron was higher oxydized by nitric acid, and sesquioxide of iron and 

 ii lumina precipitated by ammonia ; an excess of acetic acid was added to the pre- 

 cipitate and repeatedly evaporated to dryness in a water bath. In this manner 

 the acetates of iron and alumina were decomposed, and sesquioxide of iron 

 and alumina separated from the soluble acetates by filtration. Alumina 

 and iron were separated by caustic potash. Lime precipitated from the acetates 

 by oxalate of ammonia. The filtrate containing magnesia and alkalies was 

 evaporated to dryness, and heated until the ammoniacal salts were expelled; from 

 the residue the magnesia was separated from the alkalies by oxide of mercury ; 

 The chlorides of alkalies were weighed together and afterwards separated by 

 bichloride of platinum. 



II. The mineral was dissolved in hydrochloric acid and cooled, while a 

 constant current of carbonic acid passed over it, in order to prevent the oxi- 

 dation of oxide of iron by atmospheric air ; then a sufficient quantity of ter- 

 <-hloride of gold and sodium was added, and the reduced gold filtered after 24

hours' standing. From the weight of gold the quantity of oxide of iron was 

 found by calculation. 



III. and IV. For the determination of water, the mineral was exposed to a 

 bright red heat in a well covered platinum crucible. The loss in weight gave 

 the quantity of water ; but this was always a little too low, because a small 

 quantity of oxide of iron was found to have higher oxydized; 



V. In analysis V the silica was separated as above, then the filtrate oxydized 

 by nitric acid and alumina, with, sesquioxide of iron precipitated by ammonia. 

 The precipitate was boiled with caustic potash in a silver vessel, and thus ses- 

 quioxide of iron was separated from alumina. The precipitate of sesquioxide of 

 iron was dissolved in hydrochloric acid and precipitated by ammonia. The 

 filtrate of it containing still a small quantity of magnesia was added to the 

 liquid containing lime and magnesia. The lime was precipitated by oxalate of 

 ammonia, and from the filtrate of oxalate of lime, the magnesia by phosphate of 

 soda.

Dentition. Upper jaw, after the two incisors, having on each side seven 

 false molars, which are pointed and nearly equal, except the last, which is 

 double the size of either of the others, and has a small exterior basal lobe. 

 Molars three, the first with four external lobes, the anterior being very small, 

 the second large and pointed, the third short, blunt and deeply emarginate, the 

 fourth lobe also blunt and short ; besides these the first molar has one interior 

 and one posterior lobe, second molar with three short external lobes, the in- 

 termediate one emarginate; also two interior large and pointed, and one posterior 

 similar to the interior lobe; third molar with two short external lobes, the pos- 

 terior one emarginate, and two interior lobes and one posterior lobe. 



Lower jaw with two incisors on each side, the anterior of which is the 

 shorter ; these are followed by six false molars, which are pointed and nearly 

 equal in size, except the last, which is much larger and furnished with a minute 

 posterior lobe at the base. Molars three, each deeply sulcate on the external 

 surface and composed of two large external lobes and three smaller and shorter 

 internal lobes. 



Dimensions. Total length (of specimen in spirits) about 5 inches ; head 2, 

 fore feet 1.15, hind feet 1.40, tail 1.25 inches ; first and fifth toes of fore feet 

 equal, second shorter, first and fifth toes of the hind feet equal, other three 

 nearly so. 



Colors. Entirely shining, brassy brown, very glossy, and in some lights ap- 

 pearing to be almost metallic ; darker on the top of the head, and lighter and 

 more obscure on the chin and throat ; nose dusky ; feet brownish ; nails and first 

 joint of the toes black ; palms dusky ; soles of the hind feet dark brown ; tail 

 light brown, thinly furnished with scattering bristles. 



Obs. This is the most beautiful species of mole yet discovered in America, 

 and exhibits almost the brilliancy of color which distinguishes the remarkable 

 South African animals which form the genus Chrysochloris, of this family. 



A single specimen, apparently fully adult, is in the collection of the Exploring 

 Expedition, labelled as having been obtained in Oregon. In its dentition and 

 otherwise it is a strict congener of Scalops Toiansendii, but is much smaller and 

 of a different color. Its black claws are especially remarkable, and distinguish 

 it from all other species of the genus.

The Committee on the following paper by Prof. Baird and Mr. 

 Girard reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings. 



List of Reptiles collected hi California by Dr. JohnL. Le ContCj with description 



of new Species. 



By S. F. Baird and Charles Girard. 



The following species of reptiles were collected by Dr. Le Conte, during a 

 scientific exploration of California made in 1850-51. As in his previous travels 

 through various parts of North America, Dr. Le Conte, in addition to the Co- 

 leoptera which attracted his especial attention, collected in other departments of 

 Natural History, making additions of greater or less extent in all. 



The present enumeration, although containing all the species brought home 

 by Dr. Le Conte, gives no idea of the numbers actually collected. Owing to 

 the breaking of several jars and the difficulty of transportation, many valuable 

 species were lost, especially from the Colorado and from San Diego. 



The Batrachians from San Francisco were collected in February, 1850 ; the 

 specimens from San Jose in April, and those from San Diego in May to Septem- 

 ber of the same year. Bufo halophila was found at Benicia in August, and 

 Rena humilis at Vallecitas in October. The Colorado specimens were mostly 

 collected in November, 1850, and October, 1851.*

 military posts w^hich I visited, especial facilities were affi^rded by Major W. H. 

 Emory, then in charge of the American Boundary Commission, whose valuable 

 explorations in those desert regions have already contributed so much to science, 

 and whose labors, I am happy to say, are still further illustrated by the collec- 

 tions made by me. J. L. Lee.

One of the specimens is half of a lower jaw containing several teeth, of which 

 the bone is enveloped in a thick layer of peroxide of iron. It belonged to a 

 species of Ursus, and presents no difference in size or otherwise from that of 

 the common Black Bear. 



Two others, consisting of a penultimate superior molar, and a fragment of a 

 lower jaw containing the last molar, were referred to a new species of Bear, 

 under the name of Ursus amplideiis. The fragment of lower jaw is even less

 mentioned are very nearly as large as the corresponding ones in the Grizzly 

 Bear. The comparative dimensions are as follows :

Notes on the Ornithology of Wiscousin, 



By P. R. Hoy, M. D., of Ricine, Wisconsin. 



With few exceptions, the facts contained in the following brief Notes were 

 obtained from personal observations made within 15 miles of Racine, Wisconsin, 

 Lit. N. 42*^ 42' ; long. W. SS'^. This city is situated on the western shore of 

 Lake Michigan, at the extreme southern point of the heavy timbered district 

 where the great prairies approach near the lake from the west, and is a remark- 

 ably favorable position for ornithological investigations. It would appear that 

 This is a grand point, a kind of rendezvous, that birds make during their migra- 

 tions. Here, within the last seven years, I have noticed 283 species of birds, 

 about one-twentieth of all known to naturalists, n)any of which, considered 

 rare in other sections, are found here in the greatest abundance. It will be seen 

 that a striking peculiarity of the ornithological fauna of this section is, tliat 

 southern birds go further nortlt in summer, while northern species go further 

 south in winter than they do east of the great lakes. 



[' Indicates those known to nest within ;lie State.] 



VULTURIN.t:, (1 species.)

II is a fact worthy of note that this nobis eagle, in the absence of rocky cliffs 

 for its eyrio, does occasionally nest on ^;ee5. One instance occurred between 

 Racine and Milwaukee, in 1S51. The nest was fixed in the triple Ibrks of a 

 a large oak. 



Halmztus Wasiiingtonii, And. 



I procured, in 1850, a living bird that had been slightly wounded, which 

 answered to Audubon's description of this donhtfat species. 1 kept it in an 

 ample cage upwards of two years, but before its death it underwent changes in 

 plumage which led me to believe that, had it lived, it would have proved to b? 

 the white-headed species. I put several species of hawks and owls into the 

 same apartment, several of which the. eagle killed and devoured without cere- 

 mony. When a fowl was introduced, he pounced upon it, and without attempting 

 to kill, proceeded to pluck it with the greatest unconcern, notwithstanding its 

 piteous screams and struggles. 



It is my opinion that the Bird of Washington will prove to be only an unusually 

 marked large and fine immature white-headed eagle. My specimen, a female, 

 measured 7^ ft. in alar extent. 



*Hali/ETUS lexjcocephalus, Linn. 



Numerous throughout the State. I have seen one of these fine birds pounce 

 upon and capture a fish in the lake. The eagle did not disappear wholly under 

 the water, which led me to snspect that the fish was in some way disHibled. 



*Pandiox hali.etus, Linn. 

 Not uncommon. 



*Falco TEiiEGRii^rSy Gmcl, 



This noble falcon is frequently met with, although not so numerous as many 

 other hawks. A pair nested for several years within ten miles of this city; 

 constructing their nest on the top of a large red beech-tree. 



I have seen one of these daring hawks make a swoop into a floek of blue- 

 winged tea], killing two on the spot. 



*Fal,co colujibarius, liinn. 



This active little I'alcon is numerous, especially in spring and fall, during the 

 miiiration of the smaller birds. A few nest with us, nmany more in the pine 

 forests- of the northern part of the State. Those that nest in this vicinity regu- 

 larly morning and eveniag visit the lake shore, in quest of bank swallows, 

 which they seize with great dexterity while on the wing. 



Fai^co jERALON, Gmel. 



1 have met with three individuals of this small species, Nov. loth, 1819^ 

 Dec. a.jth, 1850, and Dec. 12th, 1852. 



*Fai.co srARVEKius, Li?/n. 

 Common. 



*AsrUR ATRICAPILLIIS, Wilson. 



This daring and powerful hawk is to be found at all seasons ; the old birds 

 on)y remain during winter, the young retiring further sowth. The young are so- 

 different in their plumage from the old birds, that few would suspect their 

 identity; they are more bold and darins:, much more destructive to the poultry 

 yards than the more sly and cautious old ones a peculiarity not, hov.ever, con- 

 fined to this species. 



*AsTrR COOPERTI, Bonaj}. 



Not uncommon. They destroy many quails and young grouse, which, toge- 

 ther with poultry, constitute their principal fare. They construct their nests- 

 on the top of large trees, in the most secluded situations, and leave us at the 

 approach of winter. 



*AsTrR Fusccs, Gmel. 



Common. Nest here about the middle of April. 



ICTINEA PLUMBEA, Gmel. 



I saw a single specimen of this southern kite on Rock River in this State, 

 in July, 1840. It is occasionally met with on the Mississppi River. 




306 [March, 



*Xacclerus furcatus, Linn. 



This kite was numerous within ten miles of Racine, where they nested up to 

 the year 184S, since which time they have abandoned this region. I have not 

 ' seen one since 1850. They nested on tall elm trees about the iOth of June, 

 and left us about the 1st of September. 



*BuTEO LAGOPUS, WUson. 



Not numerous. I have repeatedly seen this buzzard soar to great hei-^hts, 

 notwithstanding the testimony of some ornithologists to the contrary. They 

 are in the habit, while in pursuit of mice, frogs, &c., of balancing themselves 

 over marshy situations on the prairies. If not successful, they sail off to other 

 more suitable grounds, and renew the same motion. VV^hen they espy the 

 quarry, they dart directly upon it^in the manner of the true falcon. Where there 

 are trees, they may adopt a different mode of hunting. My observations apply 

 to the prairies. 



*B0TE0 BOREALIS, Gmel . 



Common. They do not remain with us during severe winters. I have a line 

 albino specimen of this species. Although pure white, the irides were yelhio. 

 This individual was known to inhabit a particular district in Huron Co., Ohio, 

 for ten years. Although I had offered a liberal reward for the capture of the 

 " white hawk," it was several years before I succeeded in getting him. 



BuTEo VULGARIS, Willouglihy. 



Not numerous. One of our winter residents. 



*BUTE0 PENNSYLVANICUS, JVllsOJl. 



Common. 



*BuTE0 LINEATUS, Gmel. 



This noisy species is extremely numerous. The great number of hawks, of 

 this and other species, that are often seen soaring in company during fine wea- 

 ther, about the 20th of September, at which time they are migrating south, is 

 almost incredible. 



*CiRCUS cyanet;s, Linn. 



Common. They build their nests entirely of grasses (carex.) placed on the 

 ground in the middle of swampy marshes. Nest about the 1st of June. 



STRIGINJE, (14 species.) 



SURNIA FUNEREA, Gmel. 



A few visit us every winter. 



StJRNIA NYCTEA, Linn. 



Numerous on the prairies frofn November to March. 



*Sc'ors ASIC, Linn. 



Common. In the month of June I caught four young ones just as thev were 

 about leaving the nest. They were a deep reddish brown, in all respects 

 similar to the old female which I shot at the time, and have preserved. 



*SC0PS N.EVIA, Gmel. 



Common. I am not yet satisfied that the mottled and red owls are specifically 

 the same. 



*Bini0 viRGiNiANUs, Gmel. 



One of our most numerous species. I once put a remarkably large and fine 

 owl of this species into the same cage with the " Washington Eagle," pre- 

 viously mentioned, which soon resulted in a contest. The moment abird was 

 given to the owl, the eagle demanded it in his usual peremptory manner, which 

 was promptly resisted with so much spirit and determination that for a time I 

 was in doubt as to the result; but finally the eagle had to stand aside, and wit- 

 ness the owl devour the coveted morsel. After several similar contests, it was 

 mutually settled that possession gave an undisputed right, the owl not bein"- 




1853.] SOT 



disposed to act on the offensive. I had a fine red-shouldered, hawk in the same 

 aviary, which the o\\] killed and ate the socoml night. 



Bubo subarcticus, Hoy. 



This winter vistor I consider closely allied, yet distinct fr6m the common 

 honied owl, and as such it is described in the Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. vol. vi. 

 paije 211. I have as yet examined but three specimens. The specimen in the 

 collection of the Academy was known to carry off from one farm, in the space 

 of a month, not less than twenty-seven individuals of various kinds of poultry, 

 before it was shot. 



Syrnium cinekku.m, Li)tn. 



Not numerous. 1 have a fine m.ale specimen, shot near Racine, Jan. 4, 1818. 

 A rt^markable peculiarity of thi* specimen was, that the irides were hrilliavt 

 hlood-red. I saw one sieze and carry off a duck on Lake Superior, near the 

 mouth of Cerf river, Sept. 1st, 184-5. 



*SvRNir:\i NEBULOsu.M, Linn. 



Common in the heavy timbered districts. 



*OtUS VULGARIS, And. 



More numerous in the vicinity than any other owl. The young leave the nest 

 about the middle of June. 



*Otus brachyotus, Linn. 



Common on the prairies, where they nest on the ground, in the tall grass. The 

 young are fully fledged by the second week in June. 



*Nycta].e acadica, Gmel. 

 Common. 



Nyctalk Tengmalmi, Gmcl. 



I procured a single specimen near Racine, Nov. 30th, 1850. Not uncommon 

 on the head waters of the Wisconsin river. 



Ny'ctale Kirtlandii, Hoy. 



A third species of this genus, found here, and described in the Proc. Acad. 

 Nat. Sci. vol. vi. page 210. 



Only two specimens have yet been observed. 



Strix flammea, liinn. 



A fine specimen of this handsome owl was obtained this spring by my friend 

 the Rev. A. C. Barry, of this city. It was shot near this city, and is the only 

 specimen which has come under my observation. 



CAPRIMULGID.E, (2 species.) 



*Antrostomus vociferus, Wilson. 



Common. Arrives about th- 1st of May, departs middle of September. 



*Chordeiles virgixianus. Bliss. 



Numerous. They leave us by the 15th of September. On the lOth of this 

 month, 1850, for two hours before dark, these birds formed one continuous flock, 

 moving south. They reminded me, by their vast numbers, of passenger 

 pigeons, more than night hawks. Next day not one was to be seen. 



HIRUNDINID.E, (6 species.) 



*Progxe purpurea, Linn. 

 Common. 



*HiRUXDO AMERICANA, Wilson. 



Numerous. 



*HlRUNDO FULVA, Yieill . 



A few nested for the first time at Racine in 1852. Numerous in many parts 

 of the State. 




308 [March, 



*H!RTJNDO BICOL.OR, Vleill. 



Not a numerous species with us. Arrives fiom the 1st to the middle of April. 



*CoTYLE RIPARIA, Lijin. 



This numerous species perforates the banks of the lake, wherever the soil is 

 sandy. 



*Ch/ETURa pelasgia, Tcmvi. 

 Common. 



HALCYONID.E, (1 species.) 



*Cer\'le alcyon, Liiiu, 

 Common. 



LANIAD.E, (3 species.) 



*LaNILS BOREALlSj Vleill. 



This large shrike is most nnmprous durint: fall and winter. A few, however, 

 spend the summer in the middle and northern parts of this State. During 

 winter tliey subsist on field mice (aivicola,) and small birds. 



*LANins LUDOVICIANUS, LiJUl. ? 



I much doubt whether the north-western and southern loggerhead are the 

 same. Our bird is smaller than the southern, as described in the ornithological 

 works, the adult male measuring 8j to 121 ; female 81 to 10^. The nest and 

 eggs, too, differ materially from Bachman's description, as quoted by Nuttall, of 

 tho^e of the southern species. The Wisconsin bird constructs a compact nest, 

 placed on the lower branches of a small tree. It is composed externally of 

 small sticks and roots, filled in with strips of bark and the lint of various specie^ 

 of plants, and is amply lined with feathers, which almost conceal the six 

 sjiotted eggs. 



The male assists in incubation, which is completed in fourteen da)''s. 



I once shot a female just as the pair had commenced building. The male 

 went on and completed the nest, even to the soft lining of feathers, then took 

 his stand on the topmost branch of the same tree, and continued watching 

 almost constantly for three days, apparently awaiting the return of his mate. 

 At the end of that time I missed him, and supposed he had abandoned the spot ; 

 but the second day afterwards, he returned with a new bride, who appeared 

 well satisfied with the waiting nest, and commenced layinjr immediately. 



They return to a particular tree to nest every year. This attachment is so 

 great, that when the nest is destroyed, even after they commence incubation, 

 they not unfrequently construct another on the same tree. Mice, young birds 

 and lariie insects compose their fare. 



Numerous on the border of the prairies. Arrive 1st of April ; depart in 

 October. * 



LaMUS EXCUBITOROIDES, Sl'Vli//-^. 



I shot a pair of birds of this species in March last (IS-jS.) The female is faintly 

 marked on the breast with pale brown undulating lines. This is undoubtedly a 

 distinct species. 



MTJSCICAPID.^^, (14 species.) 



*TyRANNUS INTREPIUUS, Vielll. 



Common. 



*Tyrannus ckinitus, Li)in. 



Not so common as the preceding. Inhabits the dark swamjy woods, where 

 the harsh squeak of this species is frequently heard. 



Tvrannula eusca, Gmel. 



This familiar pewee is met with everywhere. 



*TyP.ANNT'I,A VIRENS, Li)))!. 



Common in the deep solitary woods. 




1S53.] 309 



Tyrannula. thcebe, Lath. 



I shot two individuals of this species May 10th, IS-IS. Probably not very 

 rare, but impossible to distinguish it from the T. fusca without carefully com- 

 paring the two. 



TvRANNrLA A^ATICA, Gmel. 



The most numerous of the fly-catchers in Wisconsin. 



Tyrannula ptsilla, Sreainx. 



This species, so closely allied to the preceding, is not unfrequently met with 

 about the 10th of May, on its passage north. 



Tyrannus CoofKR.ir, Nutt. 



I have occasionally met with this bird during the latter part of May. 



*SF.TOrHA(iA RT.TICILLA, LillU. 



Numerous. Arrive 5th of May ; commence constructing tlieir nests 1st of 

 June. 



*Setophaga mitrata, Bona-p, 



Not numerous near Racine, which maybe considered the northern limit of this 

 bird's summer migration. 



*SKTOPHAr;A CANADKN>1S, LiuV, 



This interesting species is not uncommon with us. 



Sktophaga Wilsomi, Bonap. 



Common from the lOth to the 25th of May. 



Setophaga iviikl'ta, Wilson. 



Rarely met with. The only specimens I have were shot 1st of June, 1S50. 



*CuLIC1VORA CERt:LEA, Ll lilt . 



Not uncommon. Arrives first of May. 



YIREONINiE, (6 species.) 



*VlRE0 FLAVIFRONS, Vt'eill. 



Not uncommon. First appearance from 10th to i5th of May. 



*VlREO SOLITARIUS, Vicill. 



This is by no means a rare bird in Wisconsin ; it frequents the most secluded 

 thickets. Arrives about 15th of May. 



*VlREO NOVEBORACENSIS, Gmd. 



I have noticed but few specimens of this species. Not common. 

 *VlRE3 GiLvrs, VieiU. 



This cheerful songster is rather scarce with us, perhaps the least numerous of 

 the Vireos, 



*VlUEO OLIVACKUS, Ll/liU 



By tar the most abundant of the birds of this genus; its sprightly and melo- 

 dious song is heard almost constantly during the summer. 



*PeTERIA VIRIDIS, GmeL 



A few only are to be found in the tangled thickets during the summer months. 



MERULTD.E, (10 species.) 

 MiMUS polyglottus, Laih. 



Occctsionally a straggler of this charming songster finds its way as far north 

 as Wisconsin. I saw one between Racine and Kenosha July ICth, 1651, and a se- 

 cond near the State line on Rock river, July 26th, 181G. 



*Ml.ML"S RIIFUS, Linn, 



V'ery abundant. 



*^riMUS FELIVOX, Bo'iap* 



Common. 




310 [March, 



*TUKD[ S :\IIGRATORIUS, Linn. 



Abundant. Arrives middle of March, leaves first of November. 



*TuRDrs arusTELiNus, Gmel. 



Common. Wishinjt to add to my collection a pair of this species, together 

 with their nest and eggs, I shot the female, and was about to secure the nest, 

 when the male, which had been Vv^atching me in the vicinity, commenced sing- 

 injr ; and as I approached the spot he glided off still further from the nest, all the 

 time pouring fourth the most mellow and plaintive strains I ever before heard 

 uttered by this most melodious of songsters. After I had been enticed to a con- 

 siderable di-tance, he returned to the vicinity of the nest; three or four times I 

 followed this bird in the sams manner bafore 1 suceeded in shooting him. This 

 movement, am! the effect of his tender song, so far enlisted my sympathies that 

 I regretted exceedingly my cruelty in destroying his nest and mate. It is 

 common for birds to resort to various stratagems for the purpose of attracting 

 intruders from their nests, but this is the only instance with which I am ac- 

 quainted where the charms of their music were employed for this object. 



TURDUS SOLITVRIUS, WilsOJl. (?) 



Numerous during spring and fall. 



Is our bird, which retires further north to breed, the same that nests in the 

 Southern States ? 



*TuKDUS wiLSONil, Bonap. 

 Common. Nests 1st of June. 



*Seiurus noveboracensis, Gmel. 



Abundant in spring and fall. A few nest in dark and gloomy swamps. Their 

 sonii is sweet, a mixture between the Warbler's merry ditty and the more mellow 

 strains of the Thrush. 



*Seiurus aurocapillus, Wilson. 

 Common. 



Anthus ludovictanus, LicJist. 



Abundant on the prairies in spring and fall. 



SYLVIAD.E, (35 species.) 



Sylvicola CORONATA, Wils07l. 



Numerous. The first warbler that arrives in the spring 1st of April; they 

 all go north by the third of May ; in the fall they linger with us until November. 



Sylvicola petechia, Lath. 



Very numerous, especially in the fall, vrhen thousands may be seen any day 

 on the prairies, running along the fences, flitting from stalk to stalk in the 

 corn-field, all the time wagging their tails in the manner of the Titlark and 

 Aquatic-Thrush, w^hich they closely reserjble in habits. 



*Sylvicola estiva, Gmel. 

 Abundant. 



Sylvicola macvlosa, Lath. 



Numerous from the 5th to 27th of May. 



Sylvicola flavicollis, Wilson. 



I shot a single individual of this species near Racine, June 20th, IS IS. 



*Sylvicola virens. Lath. 



Common. A few nest with us. The old males arrive 5th of May, young males 

 and females about the 10th of the same month. 



Sylvicola Blackiujrni^, Lath. 



One of the most numerous warblers from the 5th to the 20th of May. The 

 old males precede the females about a week. The first arrivals of this species, 

 as well as all others, are in the finest plumage. A few nest with us. 




1853.] 311 



*SyLVlCOL\ ICTEROCEPHALA, Lath. 



This beautiful little warbler is extremely abundant. It prefers localities with 

 a dense under-brush, especially hazel, thinly covered with trees. In such situa- 

 tions it is not uncommon to hear the songs of a dozen males at the same time. 

 They construct a nest of blades of grass and thin strips of bark intermingled 

 with caterpillars' web, fixed in a low bush, (generally hazel,) seldom more than 

 two or three feet from the ground ; the eggs, 4 or 5 in number, closely resemble 

 those of the S. cestiva. But one brood is raised in a season nest from the lOth 

 to 15th of June. If the nest be approached when the female is in it, she will drop 

 to the ground and hobble along with one wing dragging, uttering at the same 

 time a. peep/fig note of distress. 



1 once caught a young bird of this species that had just left the nest ; the 

 parent birds, in their alarm for its safety, approached so near to me that 1 caught 

 the male in my hand. I let them both go, upon which, the joy of the old bird 

 appeared to be greater for the escape of the young fledgling than for his own 

 release. 



Sylvicola castaxea, Wilson. 

 Arrives in large numbers about the 10th of May ; all gone north by the 2.jth. 



Sylvicola striata. Lath. 



Equally numerous with the preceding ; the two species arrive and depart in 

 company. 



*Sylvicola pinus. Lath. 

 Not a numerous species with us. Nest in the northern pine forests. 



Sylvicola discolor, Vieill. 



A few are occasionally seen about the middle of May. Rare in Wisconsin. 



*Sylvicola Americana, Lath. 



Common. The beautiful pensile nest of this bird has never, to my knowledge, 

 been described. Audubon undoubtedly erred in attributing the nest described 

 by him to this species. That presented by me to the Collection of the Academy is 

 formed by interlacing and sewing together, with a few blades of grass, the pen- 

 dant lichen (Usnea barbata) which grewupon a dead horizontal branch of an 

 oak, fifty or sixty feet from the ground. A hole, just large enough for the bird to 

 enter, is left in the angle immediately under the branch, which forms a complete 

 roof for the nest ; it is finished with a slight lining of hair. The whole forms a 

 beautiful basket of moss, which is so admirably adapted to the purpose intended, 

 so effectually concealed, so light and airy, that it would be almost impossible 

 to suggest an improvement, and is certainly one of the most interesting speci- 

 mens of ornithological architecture. The eggs, four or five in number, are white, 

 with a band of light brown spots near the greater end ; they measure 5 by 7j 

 lines in diameter. The young leave the nest about the first week in July. 



Sylvicola canadensis, Linn. 



Abundant from the 5th to 25th of May, and again from the 1st to 20th of 

 October. 



Sylvicola Formosa, Bonap. 



Rare. Shot one near Racine, May 10, 1851. 



*Sylvicola ccerulea, Wils07l. 



Not common. A few nest with us. 



Sylvicola maritima, Wi/so7i. 



By no means a rare bird during the month of May. It frequents the vicinity 

 of streams and swamps that abound with tall willows, in the tops of which this 

 interesting warbler is commonly seen flitting about, busily searching for insects 

 and their larvae. It is probable that a few nest in this vicinity. 



*Trichas marylandica, Wilson. 

 Common. 



48 




312 [March, 



Trichas agilts, Wilson. 



Not uncommon. I shot a pair on the 29th of May ; they had mated, and were 

 about to nest. 



Trichas Philadelphia, Wilson. 



Rarely seen. Shot one May 10, 1851. 



*"Vermivora pennsylvanica, Svjain. 

 A few nest in this section. Rare. 



Vermivora chrysoptera, Ijinn. 



Not uncommon for a few days in May. Go north. 



Vermivora rubricapilla,' Wilson. 



Common for two weeks in May on their passage north : they return in Octo- 

 ber, at which time the male is without the chestnut crown. 



*Vermivora celata, Say. 



Not an uncommon species. Frequent the most secluded swamps, where they 

 nest. 



Vermivora peregrin a, Wilson. 



Some seasons, about the middle of May, this plain bird is met Math in great 

 abundance V This was particularly the case May 14, 15 and 16, 1849, when I 

 could have procured any desired number ; they literally thronged on the tops of 

 the bush oaks in an adjoining grove. For the last two years I have not pro- 

 cured a single specimen. 



*Mniotilta VARIA, Yieill. 

 Common. 



Mniotilta borealis, Nuttt? 



I have met with specimens that answered to Nuttall's description, yet I am 

 inclined to consider it a variety of the preceding. 



In order to give some idea of the abundance and great variety of the warblers 

 which visit us, I append a list shot in the forenoon of May 5th, 1852, by Rev. 

 A. C. Barry and myself: 



6 Sylvicola americana, 



1 Sylvicola aestiva, 

 4 " canadensis, 



1 *' petechia, 



4 " maritima, 



1 Setophagia canadensis, 



2 Vermivora rubricapilla, 



2 Trichas marylandica, 



3 Mniotilta varia, 



47. 



All, except three, males in unusually fine plumage, the females not having yet 

 arrived. 



We could Jiave obtained many more of most of the species, had it been 

 desirable. 



Troglodytes ;edon, Yieill. 



Common. First appearance 15th of April. 



Troglodytes hyemalis, Vieill. 

 Common. Nest in abundance on the shores of Lake Superior. 



Troglodytes brevirostris, Nutt. 



A few nest in the vicinity of Racine. Not abundant. 



Troglodytes palustris, Wilson. 

 Abundant on all our reedy flats. 




1853.] 813 



Troglodytes ludovicianus, Bonap. 



I met a single wren of this species, July 5th, 1852. Undoubtedly nests 

 sparingly in the southern part of the State. Rare. 



Regulus calendula, Liiin. 

 Abundant spring and fall. 



Regulus satrapa, Lichst. 



Abundant. Arrives 1st of April, and remains until May lOth. 



SiALiA Wilsonii, Swains. 



The first arrival of this harbinger of spring at Racine, was 



^To be continued.) 



The Committee on Dr. Heermann's "Catalogue of tlie Oological 

 Collection in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia," 

 reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings. (0^^ See end of 

 this number.) 



The Committee on Lieut. Maury's communication, containing his 

 observations on atmospheric pressure, reported as follows : 



Lieut. M. F. Maury, through Dr. Le Conte, the Corresponding Secretary, 

 presented an engraved diagram, representing a " vertical section of the basin 

 of the Atlantic," about the parallels of 39 and 40 north latitude, the data for 

 which drawing are furnished by the deep sea soundings, taken by officers of the 

 17. S. Navy, in obedience to an order /rom the Navy Department. Lieut. 

 Maury says, " These data are not very abundant, but such as they are they 

 give a proximate idea as to the submarine depression." 



The diagram exhibits a striking contrast between the profile of the earth's 

 crust above and below the sea level. 



The same plate represents a vertical section across the continent of South 

 America from Lima, on the Pacific, to the mouth of the Amazon under the 

 equator, on the Atlantic. 



The object of this part of the engraving is to illustrate certain anomalies in 

 the pressure of the atmosphere, as inferred from the experiments of Lieut. 

 Herndon, U. S. Navy, on the boiling point of water, during his recent journey 

 across that section of the continent. The following extract from a table 

 shows the boiling points at several places on the route, and their eleva- 

 tions above the sea respectively : 




314 



[March, 



Heights of Places determined by Lieut. HernpoNj JJ* S. N* 



A dotted hne on the diagram represents Lieut. Herndon's track above the 

 level of the sea, according to the above experiments. " By this track it will be 

 perceived," says Lieut. Maury, *'that after ascending the Andes, and coming 

 down the Amazon to a considerable distance, he ascended or went up hill. Now 

 we kr.ow that this was not the case, because he was all the time drifting down 

 the stream in a canoe. To reconcile this apparent paradox between the inclina- 

 tion of this slope of the continent, as shown on the one hand by the running 

 water of the rivers, and on the other by the pressure of the air, it is necessary 

 to suppose, that when he boiled his water at the eastern base of the Andes, he 

 was in fact under a bank of atmosphere, and that the pressure under this bank 

 was so great as to force the boiling point up very nearly to the sea level. 



" Let us now proceed to account as best we may, for this bank, or increased 

 atmospheric pressure. 



" These experiments were made in south latitude, and in the trade wind region 

 of that hemisphere. These winds strike nearly perpendicularly against the 

 Andes, the tops of which range extend in many places nearly, if not quite as 

 high, as do the trade winds themselves. Now, then, what is the effect of such 

 an obstruction as the Andes afl^ord to the passage of the southeast trade winds 1 

 If we may judge by the effect of similar obstructions to running water, we have 

 no hesitation in saying that the effect is to bank up. 



"Pot Rock and other obstructions to the rapid current of Hurlgate taking 

 small things to represent great may serve us with an illustration that will 

 assist me in making myself clear. Any one who witnessed the water running 

 over that rock, could not fail to be struck with the fact, and the extent to which 

 the water was piled up, not over the rock, but up stream from it j not only was 




1853.] 315 



there this banking up of the water before it reached the rock, but there was 

 also a depression above that is, up stream from this bank of water on the one 

 hand, and below or down stream from the rock on the other. 



*' In like manner it appears to me, that Herndon's observations have revealed 

 the fact that there is, at times at least, in the intertropical atmosphere of South 

 America, an air-cast mould of the Andes. 



" It is remarkable how clearly these observations indicate a piling up of the 

 atmosphere to the windward of the Andes, and a depression in the general at- 

 mospherical level to the windward again of this air bank. If this conjecture 

 afford the real explanation of the phenomena, we should look on the lea side of 

 the Andes for a low barometer, or a depression in the atmosphere, corresponding 

 to the hollow in the water below Pot Rock. 



"The mean height of the Bar in Lima, as far as I have been able to ascertain 

 it, indicates that such a depression is felt there. 



"If subsequent observations should confirm these indications and establish them 

 as realities, we should then be put in possession of important physical facts. 

 We should be led to infer that the height of mountains, and of mountain slopes 

 above the sea level, as determined by the barometer, would depend somewhat 

 upon which way the wind blows, and the only safe rule of admeasurement in such 

 cases, would be to establish a standard barometer at the foot of the mountains, 

 both in the windward and the lea side. 



"Another of the physical facts besides that of establishing the direction of the 

 wind, as a function in barometric determination is, that if this increased pressure 

 of the atmosphere at the eastern foot of the Andes be caused by the obstruction 

 which that range of mountains affords to the passage of the trade winds, then do 

 those mountains in the trade wind region become a nataral anamometer, which 

 will give us in terms of the barometer an expression for the whole amount of 

 force employed in giving motion and velocity to the trade winds of the earth."

 recently, he had been unable to obtain a second specimen. On last Saturday 

 he received from Capt. Bennett, of the steamer Osprey, a fine specimen, about 

 six feet long, of Delphinus delphis, which he had dissected. The uterus, in 

 this specimen, was not, as in the former, gravid the cervix was more fusiform, 

 but still the peculiar double arrangement, noticed in the first specimen, was well 

 marked. Dr. Meigs remarked that it was an interesting question, whether the 

 cervix uteri of all plunging animals is similarly formed, and referred to the 

 suggestion in his former paper, of the use of the double cervix in resisting the 

 pressure of the sea at great depths, which pressure upon the body and fundus 

 would tend to produce abortion.

 Mr. Ord, President, in the Chair. 



The Committee on Mr. Conrad's paper, describing new species of 

 Unio, reported in favor of publication in the Journal. 



The Committee on Mr. Conrad's ^' Monograph of the genus Fulgur," 

 reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings. 



Monogra-pli of the genus Fulgur, 

 By T. A. Conrad. 



FULGUR Montforti 

 Pyrula Lam. 



Shell pyriform ; spire short ; varices none ; body whorl very large ; aperture 

 large, oval, extended towards the base into an elongate-conic, open canal, entire 

 at base : umbilicus none ; epidermis deciduous ; labium concave, with a single 

 fold or oblique groove near the origin of the canal, and a slight calcareous depo- 

 sition above ; labrum simple, many of the species having elevated strice which 

 do not revolve far within the shell, nor do they reach the edge of the labrum, 

 but leave a smooth border ; operculum horny. 



Remarks. The striae on the interior of the labrum are given by Say and 

 Montfort in the generic character of Fulgur ; but Say does not allude to them in 

 his description oi F. pyndoides^ which, I believe, never has them. This is the 

 case with a few other species, agreeing in every other respect, generically, with 

 the undoubted species. 



This genus is usually confounded with Melongeva, Rapana and others, but 

 the group is very distinct, and the animal widely different from its congeners, 

 though it does not appear to have been figured or described. Living specimens 

 are abundant on the coast of New Jersey, and could easily be obtained, whilst 

 an anatomical description of the animal is still a desideratum. The manner in 

 which the young are excluded in spiral series of cells, was noticed and figured 

 by Lister. This peculiarity is common to F. ca?ialiculatum and F. perversum, 

 and is doubtless persistent throughout the group. 




1853.] 817 



The earliest fossil that I can recognize among American species is Fnlgur 

 trabeatiim, Coii., from the Older Eocene of Alabama. The Lower Tertiary 

 species are comparatively small, whilst in the Miocene and later deposits they 

 are far larger and more numerous, and very characteristic of those Tertiary 

 divisions. 



Fossil Species.

1. FuLGUB TRABEATUAi. Subfusiform, thin, ventricose, with elevated re- 

 volving striae at base and more obscure ones above ; body whorl, with two dis- 

 tinct series of compressed tubercles : the humoral series continued on the spire; 

 whorls angular; beak produced, slightly sinuous; aperture patulous.

3. F. NODULATU.M. Pyrifomi, thick, with strong rugose, revolving lines, with 

 a very fine intermediate line between most of the large striae ; on the inferior 

 part of the body whorl is a space without lines, below which the whorl has a 

 slightly concave slope towards the beak ; angle tuberculated, the series con- 

 tinued on the spire near the suture ; in some specimens the tubercles margin 

 both sides of the suture ; spire short; sides of volutions concave ; labrum with 

 rather distant, prominent, acute lines within ; beak straight.

4. F. coRONATUM. Fusiform, ventricose, with fine, closely-arranged, revolv- 

 ing, wrinkled lines ; spire short ; whorls flattened above, and having elevated, 

 compressed tubercles or short spires on the angle, which is somewhat carinated; 

 suture channelled and margined by an obtuse carinated line.

F. canalicidatusy Lyell (not Lin.) Manual, p. 172, fig. 151. 



Locality. St. Mary's Co., Maryland. 



This fine species is very distinct from the recent canaliculattim, being'less ven- 

 tricose and having prom.inent tubercles in all stages of growth. It is abundant. 

 The largest specimen measures six inches in length. 



5. F. CANALicuLATUM. This rcccut species has been found in a fossil state, 

 but is rare. It agrees perfectly in form and character with the living shell. 



Localities. St. Mary's river, Md. Natural Well, Duplin Co., N. C' 



6. F. RUGOsuM. Pyriform, with numerous, rather coarse revolving lines, dis- 

 posed to alternate in size, and very distinct lines of growth; whorls scalariform, 

 with a tuberculated carina, the margin of which presents a waved outline, the 

 tubercles being obtuse ; spire prominent, profoundly channelled at the suture ; 

 margin of the channel carinated in young shells. Length 3 inches. 



F. ritgosns, Con. Proceed. A. N. S. vol. 1, p. 307. 



Compared with F. coro7iatu7n, this species, when adult, is comparatively 

 shorter and more inflated, with a shorter spire, much coarser revolving lines, 

 which, with the more numerous, more obtuse tubercles, give the shell a very 

 difierent appearance from F. coronatiim. 



Locality. St. Mary's river, Maryland. 



7. F. TUBERCULATUM. Fusiform, with revolving striae ; spire elevated ; angle 

 of the whorl carinated and crowned with prominent tubercles ; body whorl ven- 

 tricose.

F.tuherculatus^ Con. Miocene Shells, cover of No. 2, 1839. 



Locality. Patuxent river, St. Mary's Co. Maryland. 



Allied to F. fusiformis, but is more ventricose, proportionally shorter. It 

 may readily be distinguished by the carina of the volutions, which is very 

 strongly marked towards the apex. 



8. FuLGUR CARICA. {PyruJa carica Lam.) 

 Locality. North Carolina. Prof. E. Mitchell. 



A large specimen of the variety with short spines, is in the collection of the 

 Academy of Natural Sciences. 



9. F. FusiFORME. Fusiform, with revolving stria? ; obsolete, except on the 

 inferior half of the body whorl, where they are prominent, wrinkled and alter- 

 nated in size ; spire elevated ; whorls with obtuse little prominent tubercles on 

 the angle which is situated near the suture and is obtuse. 



F.fasiformisy Con. Miocene Shells, cover of No. 2, 1839. 

 Locality. Patuxent river, St. Mary's Co., Maryland. 



10. F. MAXIMUM. Pyriform, ventricose, moderately thick, with coarse distant 

 subimbricated lines of growth; spire short, with revolving striae; whorls con- 

 cave above, rounded inferiorly ; beak long and sinuous; columella very concave j 

 aperture patulous. Length 1^ inches. 



F. inaximuS) Con., Miocene Shells, cover of No. 2, 1839. 



Locality. Yorktown, Virginia. 



There is a variety of this shell thick and ponderous ; angle of penultimate and 

 body whorls with short distant arched or foliated spines, each of which is con- 

 nected with a longitudinal line or fold ; lines most prominent towards the base 

 where the beak is somewhat tumid. 



This is the largest fossil species known to me, and resembles F.'ariiamim, but 

 the rounded volutions of the spire is a striking point of difference. 



11. F. iNciLE. Fusiform, with distant coarse, prominent and fine impressed 

 revolving lines ; body whorl profoundly ventricose, shoulder rounded, summit 

 with a broad concave furrow margined by a profound carinated line, between 

 which and the suture is a wide profound channel; spire conical, elevated, whorls 

 ventricose; aperture dilated. Length Synches. 



F.incilis, Con., Sillim. Journ. vol. xxiii. p. 343. 



Locality. Yorktown, Virginia. 



This large species distantly resembles F. canaliculatum. It is much thicker 

 and more ponderous, with a more elevated spire, and with rounded volutions 

 destitute of tubercles. 



12. F. coNTRARiuM. Pyriform, sinistral, with wrinkled revolving lines, obso- 

 lete on the middle of the large whorl ; shoulder obtusely angulated, without 

 tubercles; summit of the whorls concave; whorls of the spire angulated in the

F. GiBBosL'M. Pyriform, ventricose, thick, armed with broad prominent 

 foliated thick spines; shoulder carinated ; spire short, the four upper whorls 

 tuberculated on the upper margin of the suture; columella sinuous ; middle of 

 the beak profoundly tumid, on which elevation are robust alternated wrinkled 

 stride ; labrum channelled below, corresponding to the external hump; margin of 

 labrum very sinuous towards the base, the interior with slightly raised lines, 

 and of a yellowish orange color ; color white, with long purplish lines and a 

 broad indistinct revolving white band on the body whorl. 



PyruJa 'perversa, var. Kiener, pi. 9, fig. 2. 



The revolving lines are obsolete on the upper part of the body whorl, and 

 there are revolving wrinkled slightly raised lines on the spire. 



A specimen of this species is in the collection of the Academy, and Kiener's 

 figure has a close resemblance to it. It is not known to inhabit the coast of the 

 United States, and is probably from Campeachy Bay. 



This shell is not a variety of F. ferversum, as Kiener supposes, but if not a 

 distinct species, must be a sinistral variety of F. carica. That shell, however, 

 is common on the coast of the United States, but a sinistral specimen is there 

 unknown.

Notes on Shells* 



By T. A. Conrad. 



DreissenAj Van Beneden. 



There Is but one species of this genus known to inhabit the waters of North 

 America. It is a small shtll, very abundant in Virginia, attached by its 

 byssus to the Ostrea virglniana. I described it in the Journal of the Academy 

 of Natural Sciences, vol. vi. p. 263, pi. 11, fig. 13, under the name of Mytilus 

 leiicophceatiis, 



Artemis, Pali. 



There are three species of this genus on the Atlantic coast of the United 

 States, one of which occurs fossil in the Miocene of Virginia, {A. co7icentrica.) 

 As they do not appear to be correctly named in Reeve's monograph, the follow- 

 ing corrections are submitted :

This genus, very nearly connected with Fnrpnrai does not abound in species 

 either recent or fossil. It makes its first appearance in the Eocene, and I have 

 not met with it anywhere in this country, except in the older Eocene of Ala- 

 bama. Three species referred to Buccinum by Deshiiyes in his Coq. Foss. 

 viz. ohtnsum, semicostatum and jjatnlum, must either be arranged in the present 

 genus or in Sowerby's genus Gastrid/icm, which does not materially differ from 

 Acanthina, the only variation consisting in its small or obsolete tooth. In the 

 Claiborne species the tooth, though small, is never obsolete in perfect spe- 

 cimens.

Major Le Cunte exhibited a single valve of Dipsas plicatus, in which 

 the shell had been opened, and small images of lead inserted, which the 

 animal had covered with nacre, forming artificial pearls. 



Dr. Le Conte made some remarks on the specimens of Scalops in the Col- 

 lection of the Academy, and pointed out the want of uniformity in the generic 

 characters separating that genus from Talpa. 



In many of our species the number of teeth is the same as in Talpa europaea, 

 the only differences being in the size of the first and fourth teeth ; the latter of 

 which is much elongated in the European mole, while in ours it is either of the 

 same size or scarcely perceptibly larger than the adjacent teeth. 



In Scalops aquaticus alone does the dentition show any decided modification ; 

 the teeth are here only 36 in number; their form and situation are already well 

 known, and are described in all systematic works; the anterior upper tooth 

 is enlarged, as in the other American moles, but to a still greater extent. 

 The hind feet are also webbed, almost to the root of the nail, while in the others 

 the toes are separated as in Talpa. 



The form of the snout is also mentioned among the generic differences. In 

 Talpa the snout is broad and depressed and the nostrils are terminal. In Scalops 

 aquaticus, the snout is moderately depressed and the nostrils superior. In S. 

 Townsendii and aeneus, the snout is much elont^ated, slender, and the nostrils are 

 superior. In S. Breweri, the snout has the same slender form as in the two last 

 mentioned, but the nostrils are entirely lateral. 



In view of the unsatisfactory nature of these differences, Dr. Le Conte be- 

 lieves that it is better to suppress the genus Scalops, and place all the species 

 under Talpa, than still farther to subdivide the group into genera. Talpa may 

 then be divided into three groups : 



1. Dentes 44, 4to superiore et 5to inferioribus maiore ; rostrum latum depres- 

 sum, naribus terminalibus ; pedes postici non palmati. 



To this group belong Talpa europoea and T. coeca, both European; and dif- 

 fering in the size of the incisor teeth, the middle of which are larger than the 

 lateral ones in T. cceca, while all are equal in T. europaea. 



There is in the Academy a specimen labelled " Scalops Breweri," which 

 belongs to this division, and by description approaches to Talpa cceca, in the 

 increased size of the middle incisors. In comparison with T. europcea, besides 

 the difference in the incisors, the four small teeth following the long canine-like 

 teeth of the upper jaw, show great differences. In th(? one under consideration, 

 the three anterior ones are equal and very small, and the fourth is larger and 

 simply compressed, not lobed, though declivous posteriorly. In the lower jaw, 

 the enlarged canine-like 5th tooth is follovved by four small simple and equal 

 teeth; then follow the ordinary cuspidate teeth, which pres^^nt no appreciable 




1853.] 327 



differences. In color the specimen precisely resembles Talpa europaea ; the hair 

 of the tail is, however, entirely black. 



Nose to root of tail ..... 4*8 inches. 

 Tail '8 *' 



Locality unknown. For this new species the name T. reposta is pro- 

 posed. 



2. Dentes 44, incisivis mediis superioribus magnis, dente 4to superiore vix 

 elonsrato : rostrum elongatum, gracile naribus vel lateralibus, vel supernis ; pedes 

 postici non palmati. 



Of Th^' seven teeth following the enlarged incisors of the upper jaw, the three 

 first are pointed, conical, and increase gradually in size; the three next are 

 small, very slightly compressed, and also increase a little in size; the 7th is 

 triangular, moderately large, and has a small antero-internal cusp, which is 

 larger in T. Breweri than in the other species, which seem to differ principally 

 in color. The following table will express the relations : 



Nares laterales. 

 Cinereo-nigra, Cauda longa, valJe pilosa . . . Breweri. 



Nares superni, cauda brevi parce pilosa. 

 7?^neo brunea ungues f.ntici niirri .... aenea.* 



Concolor, (fusco-nigra) pedibus solis pallidioribus . Townsendii. 



Cinereo-nigra, pedibus pallidis, fronte vittaque inferna 



albis ......... taeniata. 



The singularly marked specimens referred by Dr. Bachman (Jour. Acad. 8, 

 58, and Bost. Journ. Nat. Hist. 4, 31,) as varieties of Scalops Tow^u'endii, and 

 afterwards (Quadr. of America, pi. 145,) erroneously figured by Mr. Audu- 

 bon as the type, seem to present sufficient characters to rank as a distinct 

 species. The third tooth of the upper jaw following the large incisor is 

 more elongated than in the true Talpa Townsendii : the posterior cusps of the 

 7lli and 8th lower teeth, although distinct, are smaller than in T. Townsendii, 

 and there is no distinct internal basal margin coimected with the cusp. I have, 

 therefore, separated it as distinct under the name Talpa 1 ae n i a t a. 



3. Dentes 36, primo superiore, 2do inferiore magnis, rostrum subdepressum, 

 naribus supernis ; pedes postici palmati. 



This group contains the typical Scalops aquaticus, and probably also S. 1 a t i- 

 ra a n u s Bachman, (Bost. Journ. 4, 34), which differs by its coarser and slightly 

 curled hair, and larger anterior feet. A specimen in the Academy differs from 

 S. aquaticus in being much larger (equal in size to Talpa Europaea,,) and in 

 having much larger anterior feet : the hair is, however, soft and lustrous, as in 

 T. a q u a t ic a ; ihe color is uniform yellowish brovvn at tip, dark cinereous at 

 base; feet and tail pale; the latter is short and naked. This appears to be the 

 yellow mole of Pi^nnant, (Synops. Quadrupeds, p. 312,) described from a speci- 

 men without teeth, and referred, on account of its size, to T. europaea. The 

 dentition of our specimen shows no difference worthy of notice. This species 

 should be called Talpa Pennant i"i. 



Unknown in recent times is Talpa cupreata Raf. (Precis des decouvertes 

 et travaux Somiologiques, Palerme, 1814, page 14.) The description is as 

 follows : 



*' Queue le septieme de la longueur, totale brun luisant argente, a reflets 

 cuivres et pourpres, gorge legerement roussatre, museau couleur de chair et nu, 

 pieds concolors. Obs. De I'Amer. septentrionale." 



Probably identical with this species is the black and shining purple mole from 

 Virginia described by Seba, p. 51, plate 32, and the purple species described by 

 Dr. T. W. Harris, in the New England Farmer.

New York. This is a rare species, of which I possess only females, although 

 from its resemblance in form to the preceding, we may be almost confident that 

 the antennae of the male are irregular. The abdomen is densely rugous, the 

 rugas towards the middle are almost longitudinal. The antennae are longer than 

 the head and thorax, and slander.

Middle States, abundant. Differs from M. violaceus in the thorax being 

 shorter, less shining, and more densely punctured. The antennae are shorter 

 and stouter than in the two preceding species. The rugae of the elytra 

 are broad, but not deep; the rugce of the abdomen are fine and irregular. 

 M. nigra Kirbij seems to be merely a faded specimen ; at least the very short 

 description points out no distinctive character. The color in my series varies 

 from greenish black to blackish purple.

One male specimen, Pennsylvania. This species is so similar in characters 

 to the preceding, that I hesitate to consider it distinct. On close comparison, 

 however, the differences are absolutely irreconcileable. The antennas are longer 

 and more slender, so that the four last joints are equal in length to the four that 

 precede them. The punctures of the head and thorax are less dense and more 

 equally distributed ; the thorax, instead of being ovoid, is rather bell shaped, 

 from the concavity of the sides ; it is somewhat narrowed behind, and the base 

 is scarcely emarginate. The elytra are broader and much more obtuse at the 

 apex; the basal impression is altogether transverse, and not at all longitudinal. 

 The color is greenish black, becoming distinctly green on the elytra.

The antennae in the figure are represented slender, as in M. angusticollis ISay, 

 and 31. moerens hec. In color it resembles the latter, but no mention is made 

 of the elytral punctures, which form a very conspicuous character of that spe- 

 cies. From the small size of the punctures of the head and thorax it would 

 appear probable that Leach had M. angusticollis Say in view, but as the re- 

 markably small size of the thorax is not alluded to, I do not feel justified in 

 sacrificing Say's good description to Leach's very poor one, until it shall be ren- 

 dered necessary by the examination of Leach's typical specimens, if they should 

 still exist. 



Cysteodemus Lee. 



Although possessing a species of this curious genus, Brandt and Erichson 

 seem to have been misled b)'^ its external resemblance to Meloe, and have there- 

 fore failed to recognise its generic value. There is a radical difference in the 

 elytra, which, instead of being coriaceous and imbricate, are here of a strong 

 and firm structure, with the suture regular. In certain species the elytra are 

 very large, so as to extend far beyond the abdomen; they are then connate at the 

 suture; in other species (the first division) the elytra are small, although con- 

 vex and inflated ; they are then entirely separated, and commence diverging 

 from the very base, on account of the large size of the abdomen. The antennae 

 are short and filiform, 11-jointed, the 2d joint short, the 3d scarcely longer than 

 the 4th. The palpi are much shorter than in Meloe. The legs are long and 

 slender, the spurs are small, slender and acute; the claws of the tarsi are 

 toothed near the base.

Meloe cancellatus 'Br. &f Er., (1. c. 141, tab. 8, fijr. 9,) belongs to the fir>t 

 division of this genus, but is distinguished by having the interstices of the large

Henous Ilald, 



Though the characters of this genus approach very closely to Meloe, yet there 

 is again a difference in the elytra, which are connate, and not at all imbricate. 

 The form of the body is nearly that of some species of Lytta ; the elytra are oblong- 

 elongate, convex, a little shorter than the abdomen and obtusely obliquely truncate 

 at tip. Tlie antenna are filiform, or rather setaceous, the 2d joint short, the 3d 

 joint as long as the two following united ; the 3d to the 6th slightly dilated in the 

 male ; the labrum is slightly emarginate ; the palpi, as in Lytta, moderately long 

 and slightly dilated. The legs are slender, one of the spurs of the posterior 

 tibias is concave and obtuse : the ungues are cleft to the base, with the parts 

 nearly equal. When the abdomen of the female is distended, the upper segments 

 are separated from the central segments by a wide membraneous space.

After a very careful study of the numerous species of this genus inhabiting 

 the United States, I have concluded that the groups separated under the names 

 Pyrota Dej., Epicauta Redt. (iDej.) and Tegrodera J><?c., are unnecessary. 'J'he 

 only characters of the two first consist in the form of the antenna?, and in look- 

 ing over a number of species, one will readily perceive that there is a legular 

 transilion from one group to another ; other forms of antennae (such as appear 




1853.] 331 



in division C.,) although equally common, and less intimately related to the 

 other groups, have not, however, been commemorated by a generic name. 



Tegrodera Lee. was established on a single Californian species, differing 

 remarkably in appearance from all the other species known to me, and having 

 the claws of the tarsi apparently toothed instead of bifid. On close examination 

 I find that this apparent tooth is not a protuberance on the claw, as in Cysteo- 

 demus, but merely the ordinary inferior division of the claw, which is here 

 shorter and more intimately connected with the claw itself, the line of junction 

 being visible quite to the base of the claw. 



In consequence of the changes in classification, which are here proposed, I 

 give the following as the diagnosis of Lytta : 



Corpus prascipue alatum, elytris integris non imbricatis ; antennis ll-articu-

A beautiful little species found near Sacramento, California, by Mr. Child, 

 and given me by Mr. S. S. Rathvon. Head bright golden green, sparsely punctured, 

 with a few fine gray hairs ; occiput rounded; vertex broadly impressed, with a 

 small red >pot. Antennae black, joints 3-9, slender, scarcely increasing in thick- 

 ness, longer than the head and thorax, (remainder wanting.) Thorax shining 

 golden green, longer than wide, oval, sparsely punctured, base slightly reflexed.

Cantharis hi gens Le Conte, Ann. Lye. 5, 161. 



Abundant at San Diego, California. A long, slender, black species, resem- 

 bling some in Division (B.), but with the antennae of the present division. Head 

 moderately punctured and pilose, base broadly rounded, vertex slightly im- 

 pressed, not spotted. Antennas as long as the head and thorax, moderately 

 thickened externally, outer joints rounded, very little longer than wnde. Thorax 

 narrower than the head, one half longer than wide, narrowed at tip, base scarcely 

 at all marijined, disc sparsely punctured and pilose, scarcely impressed. Elytra 

 long, parallel, a little wider than the thorax, scabrous, sparsely pilose. Middle 

 tibice slightly curved ; posterior tibiae with the outer spur a little thicker than 

 the inner one, concave and slightly obtuse at apex. 



The difference between the spurs of the posterior tibias is not obvious, except 

 on very close inspection, but the appearance of the species refers it to this divi- 

 sion rather than to those with two acute spurs on the posterior tibise.

Mexican Boundary Commission; collected by Mr. Clark, imder Col. J. D.

 the latter is less companulate, more convex, and not impressed anteriorly; the 

 elytra are more dilated posteriorly, and diverge at the suture. The ieet and an- 

 tennae precisely as in C. chalybea. 



C. sphaericollis {Lytta syh. Say. Journ. Ac. Nat. Sc. 3,299,) must be 

 closely related to these two species, but will be distinguished by its more slender 

 form, and by the second joint of the antennae being rufous.

One male specimen. Louisiana ; Mr. Guex. Body slender, brassy somewhat 

 dull. Head sparsely punctured, truncate at base, a little narrowed behind the 

 eyes, which are large and prominent ; labrum green, deeply emarginate, strongly 

 punctured. Antennce, from the 5th to the lOth joints, gradually decreasing in 

 leuiith, increasing very slightly in thickness, slender, oblong, scarcely rounded ; 

 eleventh joint subconstricted, external part conical. Thorax as wide as the 

 head; slightly pentagonal, narrowed towards the base ; disc slightly flattened, 

 with several shallow impressions, sides sparselj- punctured, scarcely pilose ; base 

 slightly reflexed. Elytra a little wider than the thorax, finely and indistinctly 

 punctulate, with a scattered, scarcely perceptible pubescence. Legs blackish 

 blue, femora bright rufous, black at the apex ; the middle of the posterior tibias 

 is slightly rufous inferiorly ; middle tibiae short, slightly curved ; outer spur of 

 the posterior tibiae broad and concave. 



This species is very similar to the next, but the black tarsi, and finely punc- 

 tulate elytra will distinguish it ; the head is less quadrate and is not wider than 

 the thorax : the anterior tibiae are emarginate at the apex internally, which is 

 probably a sexual character.

338 [June, 



Missouri. Dr. Engelmann ; two specimens. From the difference between these 

 specimens, the variations in this species must be very great. One has the pos- 

 tjrior angles of the head entirely black, while in the other there are merely in- 

 distinct black dots : there are also two black dots between the antennae. The 

 neck has a single spot on the middle, instead of two lateral spots as in C. myla- 

 brina ; the thorax, besides the four spots arranged transversely, has an apical 

 spot each side ; the disc is transversely concave before the middle; the basal 

 spots of the elytra are sometimes confluent ; the medial spot is njuch larger than 

 in C. mylabrina. The under surface is variegated with black and yellow ; the 

 margin of the segments of the abdomen, and usually the whole of the last seg- 

 ment being yellow. Outer spur of the posterior tibiae cylindrical and obliquely 

 truncate. 



A specimen from the Creek Boundary, given me by Dr. S. W. Woodhouse, 

 differs from the two original specimens in having the head unspotted ; the elytra 

 more finely and less densely punctured, the postpectus entirely rufous, and the 

 feet colored as in C. mylabrina ; the head, however, is somewhat quadrate pos- 

 teriorly, and the spot on the neck is medial ; the middle spot of the elytra is large. 

 I have therefore placed the specimen under C. Engelmanni, though it may pos- 

 sibly be a distinct species ; a much larger series of specimens will be necessary 

 to determine the value of the characters above mentioned.

Atlantic States; abundant; feeds chiefly upon Clematis. The head of the 

 female is less dilated behind the eyes, and the antennae are much shorter. The 

 spurs of the posterior tibiae are as in the preceding species. 



I was at first inclined to retain for this species the name under which it is 

 usually known, though it is not properly the earliest. By the kindness of my 

 friend Prof. Lacordaire, I have received a transcript of the portion of Pallas' 

 work which relates to North American Coleoptera, and I there find that the 

 earlier name was in reality the one current among entomologists of that time. 

 I therefore must regard the substitution of Fabricius' later name as an accident, 

 arising from the wide circulation of his works, and the comparative scarcity of 

 Forster's small pamphlet. I do not understand how Fabricius, in his Syst. Ent. 

 emend., quotes Olivier, whose work bears date on the title page, 1 795, and whose 

 first volume of plates is dated 1808.

 not for the difference in the length of the antennae, they could only be considered 

 as varieties. The pubescence is slightly tinged with yellow, and is more coarse; 

 the thorax is a little more convex and more bell-shaped; the antennae in both 

 sexes are half as long as the body; the black spots are punctiform and much

 form and stiucture to the preceding, and only differs in the pubescence being 

 denser and uniform in color.

Epieanta elegans Le Conte, Ann. Lye. 5, 161. 



Two specimens; San Diego, California. Body black, thinly covered above 

 and below with fine cinereous pubescence. Head rounded behind the eyes, 

 which are oval, convex and scarcely emarginate; punctured, vertex vvirhasmall 

 red spot, front with three faint impressions between the antennas ; antennas 

 shorter tlian the head and thorax, very slightly thicker externally, joint? closely 

 articulated, not at all rounded, 3d longer than the 4th. Thorax narrower than 

 the head, somewhat bell-shap;d, narrowed in front, rounded on the sides, disc 

 punctured, middle of the base transversely impress-^d. Elytra more than twice 

 as wide as the thorax, convex, sides parallel; riigosely punctured, with a broad 

 fulvous vitta, covering the whole humerus, and reaching the external margin at 

 the base, contracted at one third the length of the elytra, then dilated again, and 

 extending nearly to the tip, and including a lateral black spot at the posterior 

 fourth ; this spot is connected with the black margin. Tarsi b'ack, claws testa- 

 ceous, with the i iferior portion one third shorter than the superior. Spurs of the 

 posterior tibias very fine and acute. 



The careful study of this species has convinced me that the genus founded by 




342 [June, 



rne on the naxt species is not natural, as the prssont shews in all its characters 

 the gradual transition.

 three large furrows, tlie lateral ones commencing near the antennoe, and con- 

 verging backwards, the middle one interrupted so as to form two oblong love;i.'. 

 Labrum slightly emarginate, black, with two large red spots, palpi black. An- 

 tennae as long as the head and thorax, cylindrical, third joint not longer than the 

 fourth; eyes transverse, deeply emarginate. Thorax somewhat oval, narrowed 

 in front, obsoletely angled on the sides, disc flattened, marked with a few larue 

 punctures, channeled, broadly impressed anteriorly, foveate each side, broadly 

 excavated at the middle of the base. Scutel black-. Elytra broad, sloping ob- 

 liquely, so that the suture is much higher than usual, dull yellow, coarsely re- 

 ticulate; the intervals between the elevated lines are fuscous behind the middle, 

 where there is a narrow, transverse, black band, the lateral margin behind this 

 band is black, which color becomes broader at the apex, and is gradually nar- 

 rowed again at the su^are. Legs black, tibiae entirely straight, spurs of the 

 posterior tibia? very slender and acute. Claws of the tarsi, with the inferior 

 part one half as long as the upper part, and closely united wiith it at the base.

lnjtta segrnfiita -Say, Journ. Ac. Nat. Sc. 3, 303. 



Missouri Territory^ abundant. The fent7ale is more robast than the male, 

 and has the elytra gradually moderately dilated posteriorly, but the antennae do 

 not diff'er perceptibly from those of the male. The spurs of the tibiae are slender 

 and acute. I have made -a slight alteration in the name given by Say, to render 

 it grammatical. 



This species seems to connect with the genus Henous HahL The only differ- 

 ence to be found is in the elytra not being connate. I am therefore in doubt 

 about the propriety of continuing Henous as distinct from Lytta. 



Several very large specimens (-95 long) were brought from Texas by Lieut. 

 Haldeman ; at first sight they appear different, th dorsal channel being deeper 

 posteriorly than in ordinary specimens. The thorax seems to be rather broader 

 and more quadrate, but I cannot find any character upcn which to separate them 

 as a distinct species.

One male; New Braunfels, Texas; collected by Mr. Lindheimer. This species 

 is similar in form to the next, but its color is not black but testaceous. The 

 antennae are shorter, being only one third the length of the body ; the joints are 

 conical, not elongate : the first joint is curved and reaches behind the eyes, 

 which are more convex and prominent than in the allied species.

Missouri Territory, Creek Boundary and Texas. Say has given no character 

 for separating his two species, but suggests that they may be varieties. If he had 

 possessed the next species, he would immediately iiave observed the difference in 

 the form of the thorax. In the female the antennae are but little longer than the 

 head and thorax, very slender and setaceous, the first joint reaching to the pos- 

 terior margin of the eyes. In the ma?e the same organs are half as long as the 

 body and much stouter, though setaceous ; their first joint reaches beyond the 

 eye.

Missouri Territory and Santa Fe. This species is a little more slender than 

 the last, which it closely resembles; the elongate form of the thorax and the 

 small denuded humeral spot at once distinguish it. The antennae in the female 

 are one third the length of the body and setaceous, the first joint reaching a little 

 behind the eyes which are much narrower than in the preceding. In the male 

 the antennae are more than half the length of the body and stouter than in the 

 female ; the first joint extends beyond the base of the head.

One male; Georgia. This species is easily distinguished from the next by the 

 pale palpi and the very long second joint of the antennce; these organs are two 

 thirds the length of the bo;iy ; the first joint extends to the base of the head. 

 This would be C. unicolor Kirby, were it not for the pale palpi.

Atlantic States and jNIissouri Territory ; abundant. The antennae in both sexes 

 are half the length of the body ; in the female the first joint reaches behind the 

 eye, and the second joint is one half longer than the third, in the male they are 

 thicker, the first joint reaching to the base of the head, and the second joint is 

 twice as long as the third. Fabricius' description is worthless, and his name 

 pre-occupied by Forster. C sericea Olivier, quoted by Fabricius as synonymous, 

 is described as having the antennae short, and as being found in Barbary. 



One small male (-3 unc. long) from Missouri Territory, differs in having 

 shorter and stouter antennae, the intermediate joints being scarcely one half 

 longer than wide, the first only reaches half the distance between the eye and 

 the back of the head ; a female from the same locality also differs from the type 

 in having less slender antennae ; these may probably belong to a different species, 

 but as these characters seems light, I forbear naming it for the present.

One male from Texas ; Lieut. Haldeman. In specific characters this comes 

 very near to the next species, but the pubescence is more abundant, and the 

 punctuation of the elytra much finer. The sexual characters are very remark- 

 able ; the first joint of the antennae is as long as the head, thickened,- and sud- 

 denly bent at an obtuse angle about the middle, and then slightly curved out- 

 ward towards the tip ; the second joint is nearly as long as the three following, 

 which are triangular; the following joints are gradually narrower to the ex- 

 tremity. 



From the differences noted under the other allied species, it is probable that 

 many closely related species are found in different parts of the country, the spe

 known.

Lake Superior ; two males. Easily distinguished by its more sparse pubes- 

 cence ; the thorax is shorter, more convex, and more narrowed anteriorly, and 

 the upper surface is more distinctly punctured ; the antennae are half the length 

 of the body, the first joint reaching the occiput, the second joint equal to the 

 two following. With this species I doubtfally associate a female from Mis- 

 souri Territory, agreeing in form and punctuation, in which the antennae are a 

 little stouter than in C. Fabricii, with the second joint about o-ne-third 

 longer than the third.

Two females; New York. This species resembles closely C. Fabricii, but 

 the thorax is less rounded in front, aud the dorsal channel is deeply transversely 

 excavated at the base ; the antennae are half the length of the body and formed 

 exactly as in C. Fabricii. The pubescence is less dense than in C. Fabricii, 

 but more dense than in the last species. 



The following species are unknown to me :

elytra are more dislinct and not very dense. The anterior tarsi of the male are 

 dilated as in the preceding. 



Nemognatha III. 



Our species are much more numerous than commonly supposed, and from the 

 strong resemblance in appearance one might be tempted at first to consider 

 many as mere variations in color. As will be seen in the sequel, however, the 

 differences are organic, and the species may be grouped in a manner very simi- 

 lar to that employed under Lytta. Division (B) seems to correspond with 

 Kirby's genus Gnathium, but I can find no character sufficiently important to 

 entitle it to rank with the other genera of the family.

Missouri Territory, on Platte River. Brownish yellow, sparsely clothed with 

 fine yellow hair. Head triangular, closely punctured, maxillae, palpi and tip of 

 the mandibles black; antennae black, 2d joint half as long as the 3d. Thorax 

 one half wider than long, slightly narrowed anteriorly, and rounded on the sides; 

 closely punctured, obsoletely channeled behind the middle. Scutellum finely 

 punctured, impressed. Elytra finely and tolerably densely punctured. Beneath 

 yellow, femora slightly fuscous at tip; tibiae and tarsi almost black; posterior 

 tibiae with the outer spur thick, cylindrical and concavely truncate at tip; inner 

 one very small, flat, rounded at tip. 



A specimen from Texas agrees in form with those from Missouri Territory, 

 but the body is darker beneath, and the hairs of the upper surface are appa- 

 rently black ; it very evidently does not belong to the next species, from which 

 it differs both by the form of the thorax and the yellow femora; the specimen is 

 so imperfect that I cannot point out any other differences.

 removed by alcohol. This species very much resembles the preceding, but the 

 punctuation of the elytra is coarser, and ihe legs are entirely black. It forms,

 the posterior tibiae, though cylindrical and obliquely truncate, is very little 

 thicker than the inner spur.

Benicia,two specimens. This species closely resembles the preceding, but 

 the color is very different, the elytra are more finely punctured, and distinctly 

 rugous. The specimen having red head and thorax, may eventually prove to be 

 a distinct species; thethorax is not narrowed anteriorly in it, and therefore ap-

 densely punctured ; thorax one half wider than long, slightly narrowed anteriorly, 

 sides not rounded ; apex oblique each side, so' that the anterior angles although 

 obtuse and rounded, are distinct : disc moderately punctured, slightly channeled 

 behind the middle. Scutellum black, pu)ictured. Elytra finely punctured, with 

 a broad discoidal black vitta reaching from nrar the base to the apex. Antenna?

 in the form of the thorax, which is nearly round ; the abdomen and thighs vary 

 in color, being sometimes testaceous and sometimes fuscous.

Although so different in form from the preceding, this species exhibits a re- 

 markableparallelism of structure. In the head and thorax there is absolutely 

 no difference to be perceived. The antenna? are shorter and much more attenu- 

 ated externally ; the body being provided with wings, the humeri become pro- 

 minent, while in the preceding apterous species they are obsolete, or very 

 broadly rounded. The larger specimen has a romid patch of black velvety hair 

 on the middle of each ventral segment of the abdomen.

Although considered by Newman as belonging to the (Edemeridoe, this 

 singular genus seems to me better placed as an anomalous genus of the Cantha-

 having the anterior coxa^ inserted in decpacetabula between the pro- and meso-

The first two families under (A.) are very extensive, and must form the sub-

 cites, as those groups do not appear sufficiently distinct to rank as families. 

 There are also strong reasons for considering the Cebrionidoe as a group of the 

 same vulue. In them the autprior acetabula are more confined to ihe prothorax 

 than in the remaining thiee families, which are sma^l in extent, and will be now 

 considered.

 impressions are large and deep, so that the whole region of the anterior angles 

 appears depressed ; the elytra, as in the two preceding species, are coarsely, not 

 deeply punctured ; at the base they are a little wider than the base of the thorax ; 

 posteriorly they are about one fifth wider than at the base ; the legs are black, 

 the base of the tibiae and the tarsi testaceous ; the prosternum is pale tes-

Middle and Southern States : two specimens iVum Mis^souri Territory have the 

 fee' entirely rufous, but otherAvise do not differ. One specimen with entirely 

 black thorax was found by me in Georgia; lam strongly inclined to believe 

 that this Irfsl variety is H. oblonga Guerin^ which, however, is said to have the 

 3d joint of the antennae less than half the size of the second. Where both the 

 second and third joints are small, it is diffi( ult to deternjine theii- relaUve pro- 

 portions, and on this account too great reliance should not be placed on the cha- 

 racters given by Guerin in his division of the genus into groups. 



It is certain that this insect must b^ Say's Limp, rvjicollts, as we have no 

 other that will agree with bis description ; from H. collaris and bicolor it differs 

 in having the tborax always slightly dusky in front ; Say's observation that the 

 species has not the power of giving light, added to the fact that the thorax is not 

 produced over the head, point conclusively to the present genus.

 species is very distinct from those of the fellowing division, which it resembles

On examining a series of specimens, which I considered as belonging to H. 

 variabilis Guer,, I find differences which appear to have been heretofore 

 overlooked, and which seem sufiicient for the definition of several species. As 

 these characters, which are derived from the thorax and from the nature of the 

 pubescence, are not alluded to in previous descriptions,! cannot be certain of the 

 identity of any of our native species with those of Europe.

South Carolina and New York. Dr. Zimmerman. Piceous, densely covered 

 with moderately long, slightly erect yellowish hair. Head densely punctulate ; 

 antennae with the basal joints testaceous, the 2d and 3d nearly equal in length 

 and thickness, together they are longer than the fourth. Thorax very short, 

 densely punctulate, sides margined, scarcely rounded except at the angles. 

 Elytra tlensely punctured, with very faint traces of three elevated lines. Be- 

 neath piceous, with the legs paler and femora somewhat obscure.

Abundant in the Northern and Middle States. This species is readily distin- 

 guished by the punctuation of the thorax being l*'ss obvious than that of the 

 head, and by the peculiar marking of the elytra, which are punctured as in the 

 three preceding species, and entirely destitute of raised lines. It cannot be H. 

 pa d i of Europe, as the 3d joint of the antennae is equal in size and thickness 

 to the 2d. If Guerin did not describe the head of II. o b s c u ra as smooth, I 

 should refer my specimens to that species.

South Carolina, Dr. Zimmerman. This species resembles the two preceding, 

 but is smaller ; the head and thorax are equally finely punctulate; the antenna? 

 have the 3(1 joint as long and as thick as the 2d. The side margin of the thorax 

 is distinct and slightly retlexed.

of the genus yet discovered. It is more regularly and obtusely rounded poste- 

 riorly than the other species. The head is more prolonged, and the third jo.nt 

 of the antennae is only half as long as the fourth. The thorax is half as wide as 

 the m-ddle part of the elytra. In recently developed specimens, the sides of the 

 thorax, and the under surface of the body are pale. 



A number of pupae found with the insects have the thorax, the dorsal abdo- 

 minal line, and the margin fringed with long spines. The specimens have dried 

 so much that no examination of the mouth can be made.

Syiiopsis of the EndomychidcB of the Tlnited States. 

 By John L. Le Conte, M.D. 



Although I have not been able to refer to the scheme of classification of this 

 family, proposed by Germar in the Encyclopedia of Ersch. and Gruber, it has 

 seemed to me that our native species present sufficient interest for a synopsis. 

 The necessity of referring to a general treatise, is the less felt, as our species 

 seem to enter a small number of genera, most of which are already fully de- 

 scribed in local European Fauna, such as Mulsant's Coleopteres de France, and 

 Redtenbacher's Kafer Oesterreichs. 



The following arrangement of the genera differs, however, in many respects, 

 from that given by Mulsant,as well as from the portion of Germar's table cited 

 by him. By considering s[)ecific characters as of generic value, the genera in 

 this group seem to have been unnaturally increased, and closely allied species 

 widely separated. For our genera, the following seems to be more suitable:

 colored specimens. 



I cannot find the genus Rhanis described in any work, and therefore do not 

 cite any authority for it. As here defined it is intermediate between Phyma- 

 phora and Lycoperdina. The name first appears inDejean's Catalogue, for two 

 species from the United States, one of which (R. hremorrhoidalis) is the type 

 here described, while the other is Phymaphora pulchella Newman,

been obtained which show that E. colossu:5 Lee. is a distinct species,,and that 

 the former belongs to the section of the latter. 



BoLBocERUs FossATus, % Bright pals ferrusiinous ; clipeus pronninent, con- 

 fluently punctured, its disc concave at the end by the elevation of the margin, 

 sides parallel, anterior margin with three teeth, one medial, bounded by an ob- 

 tuse emargination which forms the lateral teeth at the anterior angles ; anterior 

 canthus of the eye prominent. Fronotum with two horns above directed late- 

 rally, and slightly forwards, their posterior margin curving in a sharply defined 

 semicircle, and forming an additional obtuse tooth on each side, which bounds a 

 deep fossa anterior to it. Surface confluently punctured, particularly in the 

 depresseil portions, the prominent part above and posteriorly being smooth and 

 shining. Lateral margin finely rrenulate, with a slight emargination over 

 the anterior angles; dorsal line distinctly impressed. Scutel sparsely punc- 

 tured. Elytra paler posteriorly, and finely striate, the striae with fine punctures. 

 Inferior parts of the body paler than above; clypeus, mandibles, maxillae and 

 serrations of the anterior feet margined with black. Length 8g lines.

B. LAPORTii. I propose to give this name \.o Bolbocerns ferrugiiiensW Laporte, 

 An. Art. Col. 2, 104, VV'estwood, Lin. Trans, vol. 21, p. 21. It is an East In- 

 dian species, and not the true American Scarab, femigineus of Beauvois, 1805, 

 Ins. 90, tab. 20, fig. 3. Scarab, frrrvghie us Oliv. 1789, Ins. 1, 9, 3, p. 18-1, tab. 

 23, fig. 202, belongs to a different genus. 



B. VESTvuDii. This name is proposed for Bolhoeertcs fitrcicollis\ Westwood, 

 an East Indian species, confounded with the North American B, fitrcicollls Lap., 

 itself a synonym of B. fftrraginens Beauv., and B. lecontei^ Dej. Cat., as Dr. 

 Le Conte has informed me. 



Geotrupes opacus llald. Purple black with scarcely any lustre. Head 

 scabrous, except a small spot on the vertex, with scattered punctures ; clypeus 

 regularly rounded, front with three straight radiating lines starting from one 

 impression, the posterior one short and medial, the anterior ones running to the 

 margin, and enclosing a small central tubercle in thf> angle which they form ; 

 pronotum with irregularly scattered impressed punctures, less sparse in the 

 dorsal line, which is slightly impressed posteriorly ; punctures becoming less 

 sparse toward the lateral margins, where they are subconfluent ; lateral fovea 

 present, scutel punctate. Elytra smooth, scarcely striate, but marked by J6 

 somewhat irregular rows of fine punctures. Pygidium scabrous, 8 lines long. 



Western Texas. Distinguished from G. blaclhurnli Fabr. by the want of 

 lustre, and the striae, which connect the elytral punctures being evanescent, and 

 in some parts wanting. 



Enoplium QUADRiNorATTJM Ilahl Rufous, with fouT elytral spots arranged 

 in a square ; surface scabrous, hirsute with black hairs. Head and prothorax 

 rufous above and below. Front with a transverse impression between the 

 anterior angle of the eyes ; palpi, antennre, a spot on th^^ vertex, feet, pectus and 

 abdomen shining black. Prothorax longer than wide, the sides convex, project- 

 ing most behind the middle; an evanescent black spot in front of the scutel. 

 Elytra each with two conspicuous round black spots, one a little anterior to the 

 middle, the other more than midway between the former and the apex. The 

 size of the spots exceeds one third the width of the elytron. 3 lines long. 



Texas. Bears some resemblance to E. A-p/c net at ur/i ?>a.y; but that sppcies 

 has a black head and prothorax. As in that species the antennce are lO-arti- 

 culate.

elytra, described as S. mbidus by Dr. Melsheimer, who, however, suspected 

 that they might be the male of S. viger. Both sexes vary in size, the dorsal 

 line is sometimes impressed in both, and the distinctness of the raised lines of 

 the elytra differs in each. 



S. PETROPHYA Knock, 1801. N. Beitr. 131. Guer. Sp. No. 4. RJiipieera 

 fulva Lap. 1834, Ann. Ent. France, 3, 326. Hh. proserpiiia Newman, 1838, 

 Ent. Mag. 5, 383. Male considerably smaller than the female, and with the 

 elytra slightly narrowing posteriorly instead of being widest behind the middle, 

 as in the female. Black, with an indistinct yellowish pubescence. Mandibles 

 black, antennae dark rufous, base black ; head and pronotum finely scabrous, the 

 width of the latter about double its length, sides convex, subangular behind the 

 middle, dorsal line impressed or wanting. Stutel circular, minutely scabrous. 

 Elytra but little wider than the prothorax, slightly tapering posteriorly, surface 

 deeply and coarsely punctured in irregular longitudinal series, leaving intersti- 

 tial raised lines, which are most regular between each pair of the punctured 

 lines. Tarsi with fulvous hair beneath, ungues reddish. Length 5i lines, elytra 

 4, pronotum 1 in length and H in breadth. In case S. brevicolU-i Mels., 1845, 

 Proc. Acad. Nat. Sc. 2, 220, is a distinct species, it will be difficult to deter- 

 mine whether the male here described appertains to it or to S. petrophya. I 

 think, however, that S. hrevicoUis has no sufficient character to separate it from 

 S. petrophya. 



Sandalus scabkicollis Hald. 5 Black, sides of the prothorax punctate 

 scabrous, convex before the middle and concave behind it, so as to be slightly 

 sinuous. Length 4i lines, elytra 3J. Cab. Le Conte. 



The prothorax is more coarsely punctured than in S. niger, (which has it 

 finely punctulate) and the single specimen observed, besides its small size, has 

 the apex of the elytra slightly compressed externally in a sloping direction.

 the 1st longitudinal, basal and medial ; the 2d before the middle, and marginal; 

 the 3d medial and subsutural ; and the 4th immediately behind the 3d. The 3 

 latter are irregular and confluent. Tibice, tarsi and base of the femora rufous. 

 8 lines long, humeri 4 wide. 



Tampico, Mexico, Lieut. H. Haldeman. 



TiMARCHA iNTRicATA. ObloTig convex, black, shining, scabrous with conflu- 

 ent impressed punctures, which are coarsest upon the elytra. Head irregularly 

 and densely punctate, front concave, with an indistinct fovea on each side; an-

 impressed, basal angles of the pronotum rectangular; hunneral angles obtusely 

 rounded ; abdomen sub-opaque, punctures indistinct. 5 lines long. 



California, Joshua Child. 



Distinguished from T. intricata by beinir more slender, by having the protho- 

 rax more transverse, with the sides more sinuous, the antennce a little longer, a 

 deeper emargination at the base of the elytra and prothorax, the punctures of the 

 elytra more ru.ose, and the opacity of the abdomen, and less distinctness of its 

 punctures.

 the elytra varied with black, with a black stigma at the medial point where they 

 cross. Head short, pronotum sinuous at base, sides sub-sinuous, transverse line 

 rectilinear and obtusely impressed, a fovea in front of it on each side. Two 

 fovere forming conjointly a V-shaped medial mark at the apex of the pronotum. 

 Scutel with two quadrangles of raised lines, one on each side, the raised dorsal 

 line being common to the two. Inferior surface flavous, mottled with pale 

 brown. Medial and posterior femora and tibine with three dark bands ; anterior 

 femora robust, simple, the down confined to the anterior margin; caudal appen- 

 dages not protruded. 23 lines long, 9 wide. 



California, Joshua Child. 



Allied to B. Jtaldfmaiium Leidy, but distinguished by the dorsal impressions, 

 the lighter color of the inferior surface, and the comparative narrowness of the 

 posterior tibice and tarsi. 



Zaitha inde.ntata Hahl. Broadly oval, depressed, dark brown, finely sca- 

 brous. Head, pronotum and scutel with indistinct patches of very short prostrate 

 flavous hair. Pronotum pyramidal, lateral and anterior margin with an im- 

 pressed line; apex sinuous, apical angle obtusely rounded, sides rectilinear, 

 base sub-rectilinear, dorsal line raised posteriorly, and impressed anteriorly, 

 transverse posterior line distinctly impressed, portion posterior to it, and ante- 

 rior portion of the scutel, transversely rugulose; a well impressed fovea (having 

 a raised margin) on each side equidistant between the dorsal line and exterior 

 and anterior margins, a second shallow fovea on each side of the dorsal line 

 anteriorly, conjointly forming a V-shaped figure. Disc of the scutel with irre- 

 gular rugce radiating backwards and outwards, medial line impressed. Elytra 

 with distinct cupreous reflexions, neurations very distinct. Feet with lines of 

 silky hair, their surface and the inferior parts of the body covered with short 

 prostrate hair. Length 15, width 8 lines.

A second specimen has two longitudinal flavous lines on each sifle of the base. 

 The latter is a female, and the posterior part of the body above is covered 

 with ova. 



Distinguished from Z. blfoventa Hald. Stansbury's Expedition, 370, tab. 10, 

 fig. 1, bv its darker color, broader form, and the greater distinctness of the foveas 

 on the pronotum. 



PiiALANGOPsis sc'ABRiPES JTahl. Flavous mottled with black, especially upon 

 the posterior margin of all the s?<iments, knee joints of all the feet and base of 

 the antenna?, brown. Upp^^r extremity of the femora strongly curved inwards 

 toward the base ; externally and above regularly reticulate with blackish, and

 sides and ap'^x brown. 5 lines long to the end of the wings. 



Fort Gates, Western Texas, Lt. H. Haldeman. 



Resembles X. apicalis Say, (which occurs on the Susquehanna) in general 

 appearance, but it is smaller, and the prothorax is much less inflated. 



Termes nigriceps Haiti. Body, feet, trophi and antennae flavous. Head 

 glossy black, sparsely hairy, globose pyriform, projecting anteriorly and ending 

 in a long horn; antenna; l2-articu!ate ; feet slender and hairy. Length 1^ line.

The Coraiiiittee on Mr. Girard's descriptions of new Neraerteans and 

 Planarians, reported in favor of publication. 



Descriptions of netv Nemerteans and Tlnnarians from the coast of the Carolinas. 



By Charles Girard. 



The sppcies here described are all marine, and were mostly collected by my 

 friend Wm. Stimpson, on the coast of South Carolina. Aware that I was en- 

 gaged in researches concernins: the natural hi tory of these animals, he very 

 kindly placed thern in my hands for description. 



The number of species thus added to the American fauna amounts to nine, 

 four of which are new to science and two new to America. 



Many of the followins descriptions were prepared with the assistance of notes 

 made on the spot by Mr. Stimpson himself, and while the animals were still 

 alive. The coloration and general form are thus more correctly given than if 

 these characters had been derived from the specimens as preserved in alcohol. 



There are two forms to which I would direct the attention of naturalists, as 

 they must have an immediate bearing upon the question of the natural affinities 

 of these families either with annelids or with molluscs. I allude to the genus 

 Imagine amongst Planarians, and to the genus Stimpsonia amongst Nemerteans. 

 The former represents those gastropods which are provided with eyes at the top 

 of their cephalic tentacles, and the latter the nudibranchiated acteons, with an 

 expanded back.

NEMERTID^. 



1. BoRLASiA. XuRTzir, Girard. Body elongated, three or four inches Ions:, 

 subcylindrical, somewhat depressed, continuous from head to tail. Anterior 

 region rounded, elliptical in a retracted state, conical when protruded. Color 

 uniform brownish red, lighter beneath. 



From Charleston Harbor, east of Fort Johnson; found on muddy sandy flats 

 on the third littoral region. 



Genus RENIERIA, Girard. Body elongated and subcylindrical. Head coni- 

 cal and continuous with the body without any contraction of the neck. A 

 longitudinal and lateral fissure on each side, as in Meckelias. Mouth nearly ter- 

 minal, on the upper surface, as in Valencinias. Eyes specks wanting. 



2. Renieria rubra, Girard. Body subcylindrical, a little broader than deep, 

 four or five inches long when in a live state. Head conical, subtriangular, 

 tapering forwards, split or furrowed on the sides. Mouth narrow and elongated, 

 approximating the tip of the snout. Color uniform brick red, paler beneath. 



Dredged on muddy sandy flats east of Fort Johnson, Charleston Harbor. 



Genus LEODES, Girard. Body elongated, depressed, posteriorly tapering. 

 Head separated from the body by a contracted neck, which is provided with a 

 longitudinal fissure on either side. Mouth terminal. Eyes wanting. Habits 

 not fossorial. 



This genus is closely allied to Mechelia.^ from which it however differs in the 

 continuity of the head and body, and also in the shape of the mouth, to which 

 may be added the mode of coloration as described below. 



3. Leodes striolenta, Girard. Body when extended, six inches in length and 

 two tenths of an inch in width ; somewhat convex anteriorly, broader and flat- 

 tened posteriorly. Head a little smaller than the body, somewhat elongated, 

 bluntly pointed, tapering, and separated from the body by a broad or very shal- 

 low constriction. Mouth slit, conspicuously long. Clefts on the sides of the 

 neck very deep. Posterior extremity sharp and pointed. Body thickest ante- 

 riorly, with a rounded margin, compressed posteriorly with a sharp margin. 

 Color of the body above dark pink, with a narrow line of deeper pink near the 

 margin on each side, and covered with crowded, narrow, dark grayish or black 

 longitudinal lines, darkest anteriorly. Body margined for the posterior two 

 thirds with light yellowish gray. Head light gray with longitudinal black 

 blotches, fewest towards the margin. Beneath dark red, with anteriorly dark 

 gray blotches, mostly towards the margin, and a white medial line; and pos- 

 teriorly without dark spots and with a red medial line and yellowish margin. 

 Tail pale, with very few small scattered spots. In the young the colors are 

 all pale except at the head, so that the dark branching intestine, occupying the 

 posterior thr^e fifths of the animal, is easily seen. 



Found at Fort Johnson, under stones on hard clay, at low water. 



4. Amphtporus sanguineus, Girard. Body elongated, depressed, anteriorly 

 broad, posteriorly tapering, sides parallel, undulating when the animal is in 

 motion. Head continuous with the body, and pointed forwards. Mouth termi- 

 nal, minute. Generative opening very much elongated, approximating the end 

 of the snout. Anus not quite terminal. Color uniform blood red. 



From the fourth littoral region, near Fort Johnston, S. C. 



5. Meckelia Pocohontas, Girard. Body very much depressed, flattened with 

 a sharp margin, attaining sometimes a length of three feet. When immersed in 

 alcohol it contracts to nearly half of that length ; the anterior third of the body 

 then becomes subcircular, with blunt edges contrasting considerably wiih the 

 remainin;; portion, which preserves its flattened shape and sharp edges. The 

 head is conical, tapering forwards and continuous with the body. Snout split 

 vertically, dividing the upper and lower lip. The vertical split, however, afl>ct- 

 ing only ihe tip of the snout, whilst the horizontal split extends to the whole 

 length of the head. Generative aperture narrow and elongated, situated near

the anterior portion of the body. Color uniform yellowish white, reddish 

 anteriorly. 



Found on the third and fourth subregions of the littoral zone, along the coast 

 of North and South Carolina. 



6. Meckelia Lizzi;e, Girard. Body six or eight inches long, flattened. Head 

 rather short and rounded, without any vertical splitting of the snout. Genera- 

 tive aperture oval, pointed anteriorly. Color uniform dull yellowish white. 

 When immersed in alcohol, the body assumes the same shape as in the preced- 

 ing species. 



Inhabits the sandy flats near Fort Johnston, Charleston Harbor. 



Genus STIMPSONIA, Girard. Body elongated, subcylindrical or compressed, 

 provided with an expanded back, on the surface of which blood-vessels are ob- 

 served, as in Acteons. Cephalic region marked with an annular and smooth 

 membrane, overlapping the anterior part of the body. A broad, terminal and 

 subcircular opening communicating with the general cavity of the body, and 

 through which the products of the general apparatus find their way outwards. 

 At the upper margin of the cephalic ring there is a funnel-shaped or rather 

 corolliform organ somewhat like the corolla of the dragon root (Arum) in the 

 centre of which a cylindrical proboscis may be seen, at the inferior part of 

 which the mouth opens. The animal sucks its food through this proboscis, and 

 the surrounding disc assists in adhering to its prey. There are no eye specks. 



7. Stimpsonia Ai'RANTiACA, Girard. Body compressed laterally: transverse 

 diameter about a quarter of an inch ; depth greater than the horizontal diame- 

 ter. Periphery of the anterior opening undulating. Length of the body about 

 six inches, and probably attaining a larger size. Ground color of a bright 

 purplish or greenish hue with numerous irregular transverse bands of bright 

 gobien. 



Found at low water mark in holes descending perpendicularly into the sand. 

 Fort Johnston, S. C. 



PLANARID^. 



8. Planocera nebulosa, Girard. Body about half an inch in length, and a 

 quarter of an inch wide, elliptical, provided with two whitish, protractile and 

 retractile tentacles, a tenth of an inch in height when protruded. Ground color 

 dark hyaline, with dark crovrded motiings, giving to the whole a dark grayish 

 appearance. From the tentacles a medial dark brownish red line extends to the 

 posterior margin. Beneath gray, except two whitish convolutions, the genital 

 apparatus seen by transparency, anteriorly tinged with pink. The periphery is 

 whitish hyaline. 



Dredgpd just below low water mark on a soft muddy sand, east of Fort John- 

 ston, S. C, by Lieut. Kurtz and Wm. Siimpson. 



Genus LMOGiNE, Girard. General form elliptical, discoid, periphery con- 

 tinuous, provided all around with a crowded series of minute black specks. Two 

 tentacles on the anterior third of the body, and terminated by an oculiform 



organ. 



9. Imogine oculifera, Girard. About an inch and a half in length and an 

 inch w^ide. Uppar surface fuscous, clouded with dark red spots ; unicolor 

 beneath. Tentacles cylindrical, swelling towards the top, and terminated by a 

 rounded black eye. 



Found by myself at Sullivan's Island, S. C, in May, 1850, under stones at 

 low water mark. 



The Committee on a " Notice of the Mja Nodulosa Wood," by Mr. 

 Lea^ reported in favor of publication. 




368 [June, 



Notice of the Mya nodulosa, Wood. 

 By Isaac Lea. 



In the examination of the Molluscs of the Imperial Cabinet of Vienna, I ob- 

 served a specimen of the family Naiades, which 1 immediately recognized to be 

 the Mya nodulosa, described and figured by Wood, (General Conchology and 

 Index Testaceorum), and which was placed by me among the nodulous Uniones 

 in my Synopsis. 



The form, thickness and nodulous character of this shell, is so much like that 

 of TJhIo 'pustidosus, nobis, that it has been thought to be the same. I gave it a 

 distinct place in my Synopsis (Ed. 3d, p. 22) with a note doubting it to be an 

 "American species," meaning North American. The locality was unknown To 

 Mr. Wood ; and Mr. Traiinfeld, the able zoologist, under whose charge this de- 

 partment of the Museum is placevl, is entirely ignorant from whence the speci- 

 men was received, it having been in the establishment during the period of the 

 late Mr. Miihlfeld's administration and without locality. Unhappily, therefore, 

 neither of the two known specimens can be traced to their habitat.* The in- 

 spection of the specimen, however, enabled me at once to place the species in 

 its proper position in the system, the teeth, particularly the lateral ones, having 

 equal and parallel strias as in the genus Prisodov., Schum,= Ca.<fte/irt, Lam. The 

 cardinal and lateral teeth are both robust, and of the form of the ponderous sub- 

 rotund Uniones^ but the deeply impressed striae separate it from that genus and 

 place it in Prisodoit. When Schumaker proposed his genus Prisodoiiy and La- 

 marck that of Castalia for the same shell afterwards, there was but one species 

 known. It is true that D'Orbigny proposed two others, qnadrilatera and inflataf 

 but I recognize these only as variations. The genus Prisodun will now, if I be 

 correct in my inductions, consist of three distinct species, each one belonging 

 to a well characterized group, viz. : the plicate, nodulous and smooth divisions, 

 and they will stand in the following order. 



(Plicate.) Prisodon truncates, Schum.=Castalia ambigua, Lam. 



v^S.nooth.) Prisodon Duprei, Lea=Castalia Duprei, Reduz. 



(Nodulous.) Prisodon nodulosus, Lea=Mya nodulosa, Wood.

 ralist to the expedition nlCapt. Seetgreaves, for the exploration of Zuni and its 

 tributaries. Full descriptions with figures will be shortly published in the of- 

 ficial report of Capt. Sitgreaves. 



Thpy belong to the Cyprinoid family, and constitute a new genus which we 

 propose to call 



GILA. 



Characterized by its subfusiform and compressed body, its more or less arched 

 back, especially in large individuals, and by its extreme attenuation posteriorly. 

 The peduncle of the tail is rather slender. The head is much depressed, pro- 

 portionally small, its upper outline concave, and its snout elongated. Eyes cir- 

 cular or elliptical. The mouth is small or of medium size, the upper jaw gene- 

 rally overlapping the lower, so as to conceal its cleft from above. No barbels 

 or rudiments of barbels at the angle of the mouth. Pharyngeal teeth oblique, 

 compressed, disposed on two rows with their tip slightly hooked. Branchial 



* The specimen has the fine nacre of the South American Naiades, and I have 

 little doubt but that it inhabits the same country with the other two species.

arches four on each side. Branchiostegal rays six in number, three on either 

 side. Scales varying in size according to the regions; small and not imbricated 

 on the back, large and imbricated on the flanks, and of medium size on the belly 

 and tail. Lateral line well marked, forming an open curve on the abdomen and 

 straight on the tail. Caudal fin forked or crescentic, generally unicolor ; the 

 tints of the back, flanks and abdomen merely varying in intensity. 



1. Gila roeusta, B. and G. Body very much swollen anteriorly, and taper- 

 ing very suddenly from the dorsal fin to the insertion of the caudal. Head very 

 much depressed above, sloping very rapidly from the nape to the snout, and 

 forming one fourth of the entire length. Eyes proportionally small and subcir- 

 cular. Mouth tolerably large ; the posterior branch of the maxillary does not 

 reach the vertical line of the pupil. Dorsal fin situated on the middle of the 

 back, and a little higher than long. Caudal crescentic. Anal situated behind 

 the dorsal. Insertion of ventrals in advance of the anterior margin of the dorsal. 

 The posterior tip of the pectorals does not reach the insertion of the ventrals. 

 All the soft rays are bifurcated. Lateral line composed of about ninety scales. 

 Color greyish brown above, lighter beneath. 



Formula of the fins : D I. 9. C 8. L 8. 8. T. 7. A L 9. V I. 9. P 'i5. 



2. Gila elegans, B. and G. Closely allied to the preceding species. Its 

 body, however, is more slender, and its tail proportionally more elongatad. The 

 caudal fin is more deeply emarginate and more developed, as indeed are all the 

 fins. The head is very much depressed and flattened on the snout. Eyes ellip- 

 tical. The scales are proportionally more elongated than in the preceding spe- 

 cies and are broader anteriorly than posteriorly; the lateral line has about 

 ninety of thpm. The number of rays in the fins affords also a distinctive mark 

 between both species. The ventrals have no rudiment of spiny ray. Color 

 liiiht brown. 



Fin rays : D III. 9. C 9. I. 9. 9. I. 10. A III. 10. V 9. P IG. 



3. Gila gracilis, B. and G. This specif^s is proportionally shorter, deeper, 

 and more compressed than its congeners. It reminds us, in shape and general 

 appearance, of the " Shiner " (Lenciscus america.Jius). Both the dorsal and anal 

 fins are provided anteriorly, as in G. elegans, with three rudimt^ntary spiny rays. 

 The scales are rather small, very thin: there are from SO to 90 of them in the 

 lateral line. The relative position of the fins is the same as in the other species 

 of this genus. Color yellowish brown.

I. HIRUNDINID.E. 



1. CyPSEL'.'S SQr^AMATUS, ?-'o5^.5. 



Form. About the size and general form of C amhrosincus and C. parvus. 

 Bill rather broad at base, curved, wings and tail long, the latter forked, toes and 

 claws strong. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin) from tip of bill to end of tail about 5 

 inches, wing 4], tail 3 inches. 



Colors. Entire plumage of upper parts greenish black with a slight greenish 




370 [June, 



lustre, every feather of the head above, back, rump, wing coverts and upper 

 tail coverts narrowly edged and tipped with grayish white, nearly obsolete on 

 the head in some specimens and on the back in others, but generally so distinct 

 as to present a mottled and scaly character. 



Under parts with the sides and flanks brownish black with a green lustre, 

 feathers edged with gray as in the plumage of the upper parts. Wide medial 

 portion of the entire under parts from t:ie base of the lower mandible to the tail 

 coverts white, in some specimens mixed with brown, especially on the breast. 

 Under coverts same as the flanks, and largely marked with white, in some 

 specimens with the latter color predominating. Plumage of the tibiae and tarsi 

 dark brown, claws pale horn color. 



Hab. British Guiana. 



Obs. Specimens of this little species have been presented to the collection of 

 the Academy by Henry G. Dalton, M. D., an accomplished and eminent physi- 

 cian and naturalist, resident in Georgetown, British Guiana. He represented it 

 as a common bird in that country, and known by the name of Sand Martin, on 

 account of its living in holes in the ground in sandy situations. 



We have been rather disappointed in not finding a description of this bird, but 

 our impression is that it has been confounded with the Hirnndo nigra, Gm., and 

 it seems to be the third variety of that species as given in Syst. Nat. 1, p. 1025. 

 The true H. nigra, which has been found in Jamaica by Mr. Gosse (B. of Jam. 

 p. 63, pi. 10,) is much larger, and is so described by Gmelin. Though resem- 

 bling in some measure the species mentioned above, it is easily recognized by 

 the scaly character of its plumage, more or less apparent in all the specimens 

 that we have seen, and is distinguished from any of its American relatives by 

 its very long tail and wings, and small size. 



2. Petrochelidon murina, vohis. 



Form. Size o{ P. leucorrhoa (Y'leWX.) \vh\c\i\^ H. frontalis, Gould, and slishtly 

 larger than Chelidon vrhica, (Linn.) Bill, tarsi, and feet small and weak, wings 

 rather long, broad, with the second quill slightly longest, tertiaries emarginate, 

 tail rather wide, forked. 



Di/}iP)isions. Total length (of skin) from tip of bill to end of tail about 5i 

 inches, wing 41, tail 2h inches. 



Colors. Entire under parts from the base of the lower mandible, (except the 

 inferior tail coverts,) dark cinereous or mouse color with a silky lustre, uni- 

 form and unspotted. Under tail coverts brownish black with a green lustre. 



Head above, back, rump, wing coverts and upper tail coverts black with a 

 green lustre slightly tinged with violet. Wings and tail brownish black with a 

 very slight green lustre. 



Hab. Republic of Ecuador, South America. 



Obfi. This bird appears to be allied to Hirnndo pata^miica and H. andecola., 

 D'Orbigny, Guerin's Magasin, 1837, p. 69, and is about the size of the latter. 

 It has, however, no white on any part of the plumage, and the tail is strongly 

 forked. 



The only specimen in the museum of the Academy was received in one of the 

 very interesting collections presented by its constant friend Edward Wilson, 

 Esq., of Pembrokeshire, England, and was obtained by him in Paris. 



3. Pktrochklidon ? tibialis, nobis. 



Form. Small, size of Cotyle. riparia, (Linn.) 



Bill curved, rather strong, wing moderate with the first quill longest, tail 

 rather short only slightly forked. 



Bimeiisiojis. Total length (of skin) from tip of bill to end of tail about 4} 

 inches, wing 3 6-lOths, tail 2\ inches. 



Colors. Plumage of the tibiae white, other inferior parts entirely smoky 

 brown, darkest and nearly black at the ends of the inferior tail coverts. Entire 

 upper parts brownish black wirh a greenish lustre on the head and back, and 

 palest on the rump. Wings and tail brownish black. 



Hab. Unknown. 



Obs. This species, of which the specimen described is from the Rivoli collec- 




1853.] 371 



tion, does not appear to us to belong to either of the genera of swallows here- 

 tofore established. It has somewhat the bill of Collocalia, with the wings and 

 tail of Petrochelidoii, and very small and weak tarsi and feet. It may readily 

 be distinguished by its pure white thighs, and is probably South American, 

 though we have no reliable indication of locality. An obscurely marked speci- 

 men in the collection, but which we regard as possibly the young of this species, 

 is labelled as coming from Brazil. 



4. Cecropis badius, nobis. 



Form. About the size of C. striolata (Temm.) and rather larger than Ilirundo 

 rufa or H. rustica* Not so large as C. senegalensis^ but strictly congeneric 

 with it and other species of this group as given by Bonap. in Cons. Av. p. 339. 



Bill rather strong, wings moderate with the first quill slightly longest, some 

 of the secondaries irregularly indented at their tips, tertiaries emarginate. Tail 

 deeply forked, two outer feathers narrow and acuminated to their tips, tarsi and 

 feet strong. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin) from lip of bill to end of tail about 7 in., 

 wing 5|, tail 4 inches. 



Colors. Rump and entire under parts from the base of the lower mandible to 

 the tail coverts, deep chesnut brown, on the under parts of the body, every 

 feather having a minute central line of black, not observable on the rump. 

 Under tail coverts widely tipped with black. No white spots in the tail nor on 

 any other parts of the plumage. 



Neck behind with a collar, not well defined, of same chesnut brown as the 

 under parts of the body. Head above, back, wing coverts, upper tail coverts, 

 wings and tail black, with a bluish violet lustre inclining to green on the wings. 

 Inferior wing coverts chesnut. 



Hah. Malacca ? 



Obs. Two specimens of this fine swallow^ were selected by the writer from a 

 large collection of Indian birds which had just been received by the eminent 

 naturalist and taxidermist, Mr. John G. Bell, of New York. He was informed 

 that the collection had been imported from Malacca. 



This species agrees very nearly in size with the Javanese species of this diffi- 

 cult genus, C. striolata (Temm. and Schl.) but can readily be distinguished from 

 that or from any other species by the deep chesnut color of the under parts of 

 the body, which is almost immaculate, and much darker than in any other spe- 

 cies known to me, or which I have found described. 



II. PSITTACID.^. 



1. ChRYSOTIS VIRIDIGENALIS, nobis. 



Form. Large, about the size of C. aiitnmnalis (Linn.) Bill strong, culmen 

 curved from the base and slightly grooved. Wing with the second, third and 

 fourth quills longest and nearly equal, quills broad, tail of twelve feathers, mo- 

 derate, rather broad, tarsi short, robust. Small space around the eye, bare. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin) from tip of bill to end of tail about 12 

 inches, wing 8, tail 42 inches. 



Color. Top of the head from the base of the bill, fine crimson, varying in 

 extent in different specimens, other plumage of the head above green at the 

 base of the feathers, many of them having subterminal transverse bands of 

 bluish cinereous, and all narrowly tipped with black. Cheeks fine pale green 

 (with no yellow or red.) 



Entire plumage above and below green, darker on the back and tinged with 

 yellow on the under parts, every feather of the back, rump, neck, breast and 

 abdomen narrowly tipped or edged with black. First primary black, others 

 green for the greater part of their length, but bluish black at their tips. A 

 large spot of fine crimson occupying about the middle third of the first five 

 or six secondaries, which are tipped with fine blue. Tail above and below dark 

 green at the base, terminal portion greenish yellow, central feathers darkest, 

 some of the outer feathers edged with reddish chesnut at their bases. Under 

 tail coverts yellowish green, shafts of the feathers black. 



54 




372 . [June, 



Bill (in skin) pale yellowish white. 



Hab. South America. Brazil ? 



Ohs. Several specimens of this bird are in the Collection of the Academy, 

 variously labelled " Psittacus vernans ?" and " Aviazona lilacina Less." It is 

 not the latter species, and I have found no such name as the former. The ex- 

 tent of the space on the head occupied by both the crimson and bluish ash, 

 varies much in different specimens, and in one the latter is nearly obliterated. 



This species appears to have generally been con'ounded with C avUimnalis, 

 (Linn.) which it very considerably resembles. It is, however, invariably 

 smaller, and has no yellow markings whatever on the face. The bill is clear 

 yellowish white, with no tinge of brown or horn color, as in that species. 



2. PsiTTACULA LINEOLA, 7lobis, 



Form. Small ; size of P. passerina (Linn.) Wings with the first and second 

 quills longest and nearly equal; tail feathers pointed, the two central feathers 

 longest, iicuminated; bill tumid ; tarsi and feet strong. 



Dimensions. Total leng;th (of skin) from tip of bill to end of tail about 6 

 inches ; wing 4 ; tail Si inches. 



Colors. Shoulders black. Entire plumage above and below green, slightly 

 tinged with brownish on the back, and with yellow^ on the under parts, rump, 

 upper and under tail coverts, most obvious on the latter. Eveiy feather of the 

 entire plumage except the quills and tail narrowly tipped with black, nearly ob- 

 solete on the middle of the breast and abdomen, but very conspicuous on the 

 head, neck, back, rump, coverts of the wing and tail, sides and flanks, and as- 

 suming the character of rounded terminal spots on the upper and under coverts 

 of the tail. 



Quills green on their outer w^ebs, brownish black on their inner webs, tinged 

 with green and paler on their inner margins ; tail feathers green, the two central 

 feathers with a line of brownish black along their shafts and tipped with the 

 same color ; other tail feathers also brownish black along their shafts and on 

 their inner margins. Bill, tarsi and feet light colored. 



Hab. Mexico, National bridge. 



Obs. This little Parrot does not appear to be nearly related to any other spe- 

 cies, and at first sight bears a greater resemblance to some of the small Austra- 

 lian species than to any which are American. Two specimens are in the collec- 

 tion, one brought by Mr. Pease from the vicinity of the National bridge, and the 

 other collected by Mr. Bruzin, also in Mexico. 



3. Ara auricollis, nobis. 



Form. Rather smaller than Ara severa (Linn.) Bill abruptly curved: culmen 

 flattened, bare space commencing at the nostril, including the eye and com- 

 pletely enclosing the under mandible. Wing rather long, second and third quills 

 longest and nearly equal ; tail graduated, containing twelve feathers. 



Dimensions, Total length (of skin) from tip of bill to end of tail about 15 

 inches ; wing 81 ; tail 82 inches. 



Colors. A large spot of yellow on the back of the neck, somewhat rectangu- 

 lar in shape, and extending slightly on to the sides of the neck at its lower edge. 



Head above, from the base of the bill to the crown, black, which is also the 

 color of the cheeks immediately next to the bare space. Occiput, and all other 

 parts of the plumage, except the win^s and tail, green, tinged with yellowish on 

 the back and wing coverts, and very slightly with bluish on the occiput. Pri- 

 maries and secondaries light blue ; tertiaries same yellowish green as other 

 plumage. 



Tail, with the two central feathers above, reddish chesnut or maroon for the 

 greater part of their length, yellowish green at base, and towards the end sub- 

 terminally light blue and narrowly tipped WMth yellow ! other feathers of the tail 

 much the same, but with the light blue predominating on their outer webs and 

 yellowish green on the inner webs. Under surfaces of wings and tail pale silky 

 yellow. 



Ilab. South America, Bolivia. 



Obs. Peculiarly characterized by the large yellow space on the back of the 




1853.] 373 



neck. Three specimens, much alike in plumage, are in the collection ; two of 

 them have been labelled in Europe as natives of Bolivia, the other without label. 



4. PaL/Eornis viridicollis, nohis. 



Form. Similar to and about the size of P. coJinnloides (Vig.) Wing w^ith the 

 second primary longest, secondaries short; tail long, graduated, with the two 

 central feathers longest ; tarsi short and with the feet moderate. A bare space 

 at the base of the under mandible. 



Dimensions. Total length, (of skin) from tip of bill to end of tail, about lOi 

 to 11 inches ; wing 51 ; tail 6 inches. 



Colors. Entire under parts and collar around the neck fine glossy green. Front, 

 cheeks, win^s and wing coverts green, darkest on the quills ; head above, sides 

 of the neck, back and rump bluish cinereous, dai kest and with the blue predo- 

 minating on the rump and upper tail coverts. Tail above dark blue tipped with 

 yellow, some of the outer feathers having their inner webs of the same color and 

 greenish ; tail beneath yellow, under tail coverts yellowish green. Collar on 

 the neck in front black. Bill red, under mandible paler. 



Hab. India, Himalaya mountains. 



Obs. At first sight the present bird resembles P. cohimboides, but can at once 

 be distinguished by the green color of the under parts, which in that sppcies are 

 light cinereous. It has no black collar around the back of the neck as in P. co- 

 lumboidea, and the color of the tail above is entirely different. 



Two specimens have been sent from Europe by Mr. Edward Wilson. 



5. Prioniturus FLAVicANs, nobis. 



Form. Similar to that of P. platurus (Vieill.) and P. discurus (Vieill.) but 

 larger than either. Bill strongs rather tumid ; wings long, second and third 

 quills longest and nearly equal ; tail moderate, rather wide, the two central 

 feathers with their shafts exserted and with spatula formed tips ; tarsi and toes 

 robust. A small bare space at the base of the under mandible. 



Dimensions. Total length, (of skin) from tip of bill to end of tail, about 11 

 inches ; wiuii 72 ; tail 5 inches. 



Colors. Entire under parts greenish yellow, extending upwards and forming 

 a wide collar around the neck, the yellow most clear and distinct on the breast 

 and collar, greener on the abdomen and inferior coverts of the tail. 



Head fine green, tinged with light blue on the vertex. Upper parts of the 

 body, wings and tail dark green, first primary light blue on its outer edije ; all 

 the quills margined with brownish black on their inner webs ; tail tipped with 

 black and with its inferior surface greenish blue. Bill (in dried specimen) nearly 

 white, tinged with horn color at the base. 



Hab. Celebes. 



Obs. The only specimen of this species is another of the valuable contribu- 

 tions of Edward Wilson, Esq., to the collections of this Society. It is quite dif- 

 ferent from either P. platurus or P. discicrus, both of which species are in 

 the collection, and is peculiarly marked by its yellow breast and wide cervical 

 collar of the same color. It is labelled as a native of the island of Celebes.

 Vice-President Bridges in the Chair. 

 The following communication from Prof. Agassiz was read : 



*' The specimen of Cambarus Gambelii liberally lent to me by the Academy 

 for comparison, has afforded most unexpected information. Why that species 

 should have been referred to the genus Cambarus by Mr. Girard, who first de- 

 scribed it, I am at a loss to ascertain, unless it be because it inhabits the United 

 States, Erichson having ascertained that there are Crawfishes with six, and 

 others with five pairs of gills, and that the species with five pairs of gills, for 

 which he proposes the name of Cambarus, live in the United States. As soon as 

 I learned that our zealous and lamented friend, Dr. Gambel, had left specimens 

 of Crawfishes from the far West, my interest was aroused to the utmost, as I 

 wanted to know whether the western range of this continent would present among 

 these animals the same diiference from those of the eastern, and the same agree- 

 ment with those of the western parts of the old world, as have already been ob- 

 served in their physical features, and in the geographical distribution of other 

 beings. My anticipation was fully justified. Cambarus Gambelii Gir., is no 

 Cambarus, though it lives in America. It has six pairs of gills, as the Craw- 

 fishes of Europe, adding another instance of the remarkable correspondence of 

 the eastern and western tracts of different countries, when compared with their 

 homonyms, and of their striking difference when opposite shores are contrasted. '*

Also a resolution that the amendment should not take effect on the 

 present members of the Institution until after January 1, 1854. 



Dr. McEwen announced the decease of John Price Wetherill, late 

 Vice-President of the Academy, and moved the appointment of a Com- 

 mittee to draft resolutions expressive of the sense of the Academy of the 

 loss which it has sustained. 



The Committee, consisting of Dr. McEwen, Dr. Hays and Mr. Vaux, 

 after having retired for a short time, reported the following Resolutions, 

 which were unanimously adopted : 



Resolved, That the Academy profoundly regrets the loss which it has sustained 

 by the death of its late Vice President, John Price Wetherill, who for thirty 

 years has been an active and useful member, contributing liberally to its Libra- 

 ry and Cabinet, and, where occasion required, to its funds; and who, by his 

 zealous and untiring efforts for the promotion of the objects of the Academy, 

 has largely contributed to its present prosperous condition. 



Resolved, That the members of the Academy, individually, have lost a warm 

 friend ; one whose advice and sympathy w^ere always ready in those peculiar 

 circumstances requiring a sound, discriminating judgment. 



Resolved, That in testimony of respect for his memory, the members of the 

 Academy will attend his funeral in a body, and that the President's chair be 

 dressed in mourning for three months. 



ELECTION. 



John C. Bullitt, Esq., of Philadelphia, was elected a Member. 



August 2d. 



Vice-President Bridges in the Chair. 



The following letter from Mr. Isaac Lea, dated Langen Schwalback, 

 Duchy of Nassau, June 21, 1853, addressed to Dr. Leidy, was read : 



"My kind friend, Professor Danker, of Cassel, most generously gave me his 

 only specimen of a rare species of the family Naiades of Lamarck, under the name 

 of Castalia sidcata, Krauss. On examining it, I found that while it had some 

 of the general characters of this genus, {Prisidon, Schum. ,= Castali'a, Lam.,) it 

 had not that of the striate teeth. It therefore properly belongs to the Tlnloyres, 

 and must be placed in the triangular group of that genus. In this translation it 

 loses its specific name, as that has long since been applied by me to a species of 

 Jj7iio from the Ohio river. I therefore propose to name it after the able natural- 

 ist, Prof. Krauss, of Stuttgart, who has been the first to describe it, and it will 

 follow in my systematic arrangement after U)uo triangularis, Barnes, under the 

 name of TJnio Kraiissii Lea, with the synonym of Castalia sulcata, Krauss. 



In Prof. Dunker's interesting collection, I observed a nearly perfect valve of 

 a Naiad, from Liberia, under the name of Anodonta Herculea, Middendorf. 

 This, I have no doubt, is the Dipsas -plicatus. Leach. The dimensions of this 

 specimen are greater than any I have ever seen of the family of Naiades. Its 

 breadth is 12j inches, and its length 7^ inches, which is greater than the speci- 

 men in the collection of our Academy. 



I also observed in Prof. Dunker's collection his TJnio macroptents,* which is 

 the same as my TJnio superbus, and therefore is a synonym to the latter. His 



*It3 habitat is found to be Danu-Luar River, Island of Sumatra. 




1853.] ^^ 377 



TJyiio Cumingii is the same with my Unio citntmoides is therefore a synonym to 

 the latter. Prof. Dunker had not had access to my descriptions of the above 

 species when he described in the Zeitschrift fiir Malakozoolgie, 1846 and 1852.'* 



Mr. Girard read two papers, entitled severally " Observations upon 

 the American species of the genus Esox/' and '' Note upon a nest con- 

 structed by Catfishes ;" both of which were referred to the following 

 Committee : Major Le Conte, Dr. Zantzinger and Dr. Ruschenberger. 



Dj*. Leidy offered the following observations : 



In the Proceedings of the Academy for 1851, page 326, some remains of extinct 

 Cetacea are indicated as having been obtained from the green sand of New Jer- 

 sey. At the request of Sir Charles Lyell, I have directed more particular atten- 

 tion to the specimens with a view to determining whether they are true cretace- 

 ous fossils. 



The species named Priscodelphinus Harlayii was proposed upon a single verte- 

 bra which had been previously described by Dr. Harlan, as having belonged to 

 the saurian genus Flesiosaurus* In regard to the cetacean character of the bone 

 there is no doubt. The specimen was obtained from the marl of MuUica Hill, 

 which certainly belongs to the green sand formation of the cretaceous series. 

 Rut as we know that remains of recent animals occasionally find their way into 

 the marl,* the vertebra under consideration may also be accidental in its posi- 

 tion. In texture the specimen has more the appearance of most of the Miocene 

 Cetacean fossils, than it has the bones of the saurians belonging to the marl, 

 although there is no miocene formation at Mullica Hill. 



The species Priscodelphinus grandcevus was proposed on two vertebrae, which 

 were found by Dr. J. Thomas, in the Shiloh marl pits near Jericho, Cumberland 

 Co., and this Mr. T. A. Conrad, who recently visited the locality, informs me 

 is a miocene formation. 



Mr. Conrad has presented me with an outline drawing (of which the accom- 

 panying wood engraving is a copy,) of a tooth, discovered by Mr. 

 Samuel A. Wetherill in the green sand, of the cretaceous series, 

 near Burlington, New Jersey. Tli8 specimen was given to Mr. 

 Conrad, who made the drawing indicated, and afterwards 

 loaned it to an acquaintance, from whoro^e has not been able to 

 obtain it again. The figure represent^^double-fanged tooth, 

 with a crown divided into five prominent lobes. It is, without 

 doubt, the tooth of a mammal, and resembles very much one of 

 the posterior molars of Stenorhynchus serrideiis, Owen, an ani- 

 mxl of the seal tribe. It may have belonged to a cetacean allied 

 \o Ba<<ilosaurus,'h\x\. until further evidence is obtained, I propose 

 to call the species indicated by the tooth Stenorhynchus vetiis. 



Prof. Francis S. Holmes, of Charleston, S. C, has sent for my inspection a 

 collection of mammalian fossils, among which are the remains of several cetace- 

 ans as follows : 



1. A nearly entire tooth, with fragments of five others, from the sands of Ash- 

 ley River, S. C. These teeth may be saurian in character, but I suspect them 

 to belong to a cetaceous genus of the family Delphinidae. The nearly entire spe- 

 cimen resembles in general form the teeth of the dolphins. It is about three 

 inches long, and is curved ; and it has a conical crown capped with enamel, which 

 forms a salient ridge on two sides. The fans is long and conoidal ; and just be- 

 yond the crown is gibbous. On several of the specimens the enamel is smooth, 

 but on the others is longitudinally corrugated. For the animal to which these- 

 teeth belonged the name of Cohphonodon Holmesii is proposed. 



2. Twelve imperfect teeth, averaging an inch in length, from the same locality^ 

 as the former, belonging to the genus Phocodoji? Agassiz. 



See Proceedings, vol. v, 333. 




378 [August, 



3. Portions of three teeth, and fragments of two tympanic bones of a species 

 of spermaceti whale, from the sands of Ashley River. The best preserved por- 

 tion of a tooth in its perfect condition appears to have been about five inches in 

 length, and at its middle it measures four and three-quarter inches in circumfer- 

 ence. For the species the name Physeter antiquus is proposed. 



4. Quite lately I received from Prof. Holmes fragments of both sides of a lower 

 jaw, two teeth, and a portion of a rib of a cetacean, from the miocene formation 

 of Virginia. The species belonged to the family Delphinidae, and probably ap- 

 pertains to a new genus. The more perfect of the two teeth appears to have 

 been about five inches in length, and it is curved conical. The fang is quadrate 

 and hollowed, and the surface of the tooth, nearly to the end of the crown, which 

 appears not to have been covered with enamel, is annularly and longitudinally 

 corrugated. The greatest circumference of this tooth is three inches in length, 

 and nearly straight. For the animal I propose the name of Orycterocetus quadra- 

 tidens. 



August 9tli. 

 Vice-President Bridges in the Chair. 



A letter was read from Samuel Y. Merrick, Esq., acknowledging the 

 receipt of his notice of election as a Member. 



Also a letter from James M. Hamilton, Esq., dated New York, Aug. 

 6, 1853, addressed to Mr. R. E. Peterson, in relation to the Hamilton 

 Lands. Referred to the Committee on the subject. 



Mr. Charles Girard made a communication, on behalf of Prof. Baird and 

 himself, upon a species of frog, and another of toad, which they had recently de- 

 scribed from specimens in the Herpetological Collections of the U. S. Explor- 

 ing Expedition. Both of the species were obtained in Oregon, the frog on Puget 

 Sound, and the toad on Columbia River. He characterised them as follows : 



Rana pretiosa, B. and G. Ground color above reddish-brown, blotched with 

 black. A deep brown vitta extending from the eye to the shoulder in passing over 

 the tympanum, and below which is a yellowish one passing over the angle of 

 the mouth. Beneath dull greenish-yellow. Vomerine teeth disposed in two 

 roundish groups, between the inner nostrils. Tympanum very distinct, rather 

 small. Feet underneath granulated. Fingers slender and tapering. Toes webbed 

 to their tip. A small and flattened horny processus at the base of the inner toe, 

 and a minute conical metatarsal tubercle situated between the fourth and fifth 

 toes. Skin finely granular on the anterior portion of the back, more coarsely 

 posteriorly, and also on the sides of the abdomen. Two dorsal series of pores, 

 one on each side of the back, but not very conspicuous. 



Obs. Is distinguished from R. aurora in havinjj proportionally much shorter 

 leiis, especially the hind ones ; also by the palmation of the toes, the membrane 

 of which extends to their very tip, whilst mR. aurora the tip of the tees extends

A communication was read from the Royal Bavarian Academy, dated 

 Munich, 6th Nov., 1853, acknowledging the receipt of the Proceedings, 

 vol. 5, Nos. 9 12 ; vol. 6, Nos. 1 and 2 ] and Journal, new series, 

 part 2 of vol. 2 ; and requesting certain Nos. of the Proceedings defi- 

 cient in their series; also transmitting their publications announced this 

 evenino;. 



Mr. Girard presented two communications by Prof. Baird and him- 

 self, intended for publication in the Proceedings, entitled "Descriptions 

 of Fishes collected by Captains K. B. Marcy and G-e'orge Mc'Clellan, in 

 Arkansas,^' and " Descriptions of new species of Fishes, collected by 

 Mr. John H. Clarke, on the United States and Mexican Boundary 

 Survey, under Lieut. -Col. James D. Graham ;" both of which were re- 

 ferred to Mr. Cassin, Dr. Buschenberger and Dr. Hallowell. 



The following communication was read from Dr. D. D. Owen, dated 

 New Harmony, Ind., August 1, 1852 : 



* After submitting my paper read before the Academy of Natural Sciences, 

 and printed in the Journal, 2d series, vol. 2, pi. 2, Jan. 1853, on a supposed 

 new earth, or a modification of a new one, 1 supplied Dr. Genth with a portion of 

 the mineral, with a request that he would examine it, and let me know thrt 

 result. 



Dr. Genth had no time during my stay in Philadelphia to enter fully into the 

 investigation, but since my return to the west he addressed a letter to me on the 

 subject, which reached this place during my absence from home, which I left on 

 the 15th of June last, and did not return until lately, when the letter was re- 

 ceived. 



I beg leave now to submit the result of his conclusions in regard to it, which 

 are very likely correct, though some of the reactions which I obtained require 

 further investigation, which I propose to undertake when the work I am now en- 

 gaged on shall have been completed. 



Extract of a letter from Dr. Genth to Dr. D. D. Owen : 



" I have just completed the experiments wath your thalia,and have come to the 

 conclusion that it is nothing but magnesia. Magnesia shows sometimes such a 

 strange behaviour with reagents, that one is inclined to think it a new earth. I 

 had the same case wuth my analysis of Kammerite (Rhodophyllite.) It is possi- 

 ble that the relations which exist in the mineral had not been destroyed, and that 

 you have a solution of the mineral, for instance, a solution of aluminate of mag- 

 nesia. I separated both w.th acet. of potash, and free acet. acid and carb. of baryta. 

 The only strange reaction was, that it fell down with NH40,0 in presence of 

 NH4CI, but I find it now in all the magnesian minerals which I examine in a 

 similar manner. 



From the oxalate of your thalia T prepared the pure earth. With cobalt solu- 

 tion before the blowpipe gave it a flesh-colored mass. Dissolved readily in very 

 dilute acid, and gave no precipitate with ammonia, in presence of chlorid ^ 

 of ammonium, and all the reactions of magnesia. The sulphate gave witi* 

 sulphate of ammonia the well known double salt in oblique rhombic prisms. Tiitr- 




380 [August, 



pure sulphate with seven equivalents of water crystallized right rhombic, and 

 had ttie form, appearance, taste, and gave all the reactions of epsom salt. It 

 gave me 50.8 per cent, of water, and 30.5 per cent, of sulphuric acid, which also 

 prove that I had sulphate of magnesia. The analysis of the mineral is, accord- 

 ins to J. L. Smith: 



According to these analyses the mineral is Saponite. 



As the original communication appeared in your Journal, I think it proper to 

 forward the above." 



Mr. Grirard exhibited colored drawings of two species of the genus 

 Sdlino, referring one to S. eri/divoy aster ^ De Kay, and the other he con- 

 siders as undescribed. 



*' Its large scales and fusiform body would undoubtedly recall to mind the 

 salmon, but on a more close examination the general shape and outline 

 are far more elegant than in the salmon, preserving altogether better pro- 

 portions between the different rei:ions of the body. The head forms about 

 a fourth of the entire length, whilst in the salmon it is about the sixth only. 

 I'he eyes are of medium size, and subcircular in shape, their diameter being co. - 

 tained nbout seven times in the length of the head. The posterior half of the 

 max.llary which is regularly and most decidedly curved downwards, gives to 

 the shape of the mouth quite a peculiar aspect. The anterior margin of the dor- 

 sal fin is equidistant between the tip of the snout and the base of the caudal. 'J he 

 posterior margin of the latter is regularly crescent-shaped. The adipose is 

 elongated, club-shaped, and situated opposite the posterior half of the anal. The 

 ventrals are inserted under the middle of the dorsal, somewhat nearer the anal 

 than the pectorals. The scales are remarkably large, contrasting greatly when 

 compared to those of S. eiytJirogaster, S. fojiti7ialis^ and S. Jiamayci/sh., o\ amethys- 

 tits. There are about a hundred and fifteen of them in the lateral line. 



The color in the female is uniform silvery grey, darker on the hack and head. 

 Subquadrangular or subcircular black spots are observed upon the sides of the 

 head, behind the eyes, along the brick, and the half of the flanks, aUo on the dor- 

 sal and caudal fins, to nearly their ed>;e. In the male these same colors e>;i>t, 

 but spread all over with a reddish tint, more intense on the flanks and benei^th 

 than upon the head, back, and dorsal and caudal fins, where the red is sometin;es 

 but faintly indicated. The name of Sa/mo selapa is proposed for this species, 

 which inuabits the southern part of the State ol Maine. 



Mr. Girard, referring to a communication made to the Academy some 

 weeks since by Prof. Agassiz, on the sui)jcct of (crawfishes, remarked : 



Previous to the publication of his " Revision of the North American Astaci," 

 &c.,he was well acquainted with the fact that the ^qv\w% Astacvs jn-ojier, as now 

 understood by Prof. A., was represented in North America. He further knew 

 that this fact was demonstrated by Prof. J. 1). Darin, in a paper published pp. 

 10 28, of vol. vi. (Jan. 1852), of the Proceedings of the Academy, and that con- 

 sequently Prof. Agassiz had no claim upon that discovery. 



As to the circumstance that Camharus Gamhelii may be referred \o Antaeus on 

 the ground of having eighteen branchiae instead of seventeen, Mr. G. said he was 



* The sesquioxide of iron and alumina contain a trace of Silica, which was not 

 separated. 




1853.] 381 



not satisfied that this fact was of a generic value, and consequently described the 

 species as a Cambarus with the same propriety as he might have placed it in the 

 genus Astacus.

This species does not remain with us during winter. A few nest near Racine, 

 a greater number in the pine regions in the northern part of the State. 



* Parus atricapillus, Lhin.

Parus Hudsonicus, Lath. 



A small party of this northern species visited Racine during the unusually cold 

 January of 1S52. 



AMPELID^, (2 species.) 



BOMBYCILLA GARRULA, Yieill. 



Arrives in large parties from the first to the last of November, and leaves by 

 the ISt'.i April. The first arrivals are all young birds, destitute of the yellow 

 markings on the wing, and with less of the wax-like appendages. These young 

 birds generally proceed further south to winter, while the old birds, in perfect 

 plumage, arrive later, and seldom, if ever, go further. I never have seen an 

 individual entirely destitute of the wax ornaments. The only perceptible diflfer- 

 ence between the sexes is in size, the females being slightly the larger. In 

 fifty specimens accurately measured, the average was : 



Females, 8 5-12 14i. 



Males, ..... 82-12131. 



They are unsuspicious, permitting a near approach. Their fare consists of a 

 variety of berries, but those of the mountain ash, {Pyrus Americana,) appear to 

 be preferred to all others. They are frequently seen to eat snow as a substitute 

 for drink.

Not an uncommon bird. During winter and spring they frequent the maple 

 woods, feeding on the seeds of the sugar maple {Acer saechariinni,) \n quest of 

 which they spend much tim? on the around. I have noticed this bird as late as 

 the 15th of May. In all probability they nest within the State. Unsuspicious, 

 easily approached. Their song lacks the melody of our other species of Gros- 

 beaks.

 Harbor, on Lake Michigan, November 15, 1849. 



* CoRvus Americanus, And. 



A singular fact in relation to the Crow is, that it never takes up its quarters 

 within fifteen or twenty miles of Lake Michigan, within this State. At Racine 

 it may be considered one of the rarest birds.

 visits the orchards during September and October, to feed upon the inner bark 

 of the peach and cherry, girdling the stems so effectually as not unfrequently to 

 kill the trees. I have watched them while thus engaged in my own garden, and 

 and have carefully examined, under a microscope, the contents of the stomachs

The Committee on the following papers by Mr. Grirard, reported in 

 favor of publication in the Proceedings. 



Observations upon the American species of the gemcs Esox 



By Charles Girard. 



The genus Esox is represented in North America by quite a large number 

 of species, commonly called " pikes " or '* pickerels," without any discrimi- 

 nation. The same species of Esox may be called here "pike,'' and elsewhere 

 ' pickerel." 



When we first undertook the study of these fish, we were at a loss to know to 

 which species might be strictly applied either of these vernacular names. We 

 asked fishermen, some of them very intelligent, what the difference in their 

 mind was, when calling a certain Esox a pike, and another a pickerel ? They 

 knew of no difference, but that when a pike was spoken of they understood 

 the very large individuals, whilst the small ones were the pickerels, the young 

 of the preceding. 



In examining comparatively Esox estor and Esox reticiilatusy of Lesueur, 

 amongst other differences, it will be perceived that in one {E. estor,) the cheeks 

 and opercular apparatus exhibit a perfectly smooth and naked sk:n, whilst in the 

 other {E. reticulatns) these same parts are scaly all over. 



In tracing the character throughout the range of the species we find naked 

 cheeks and opercular apparatus in the maskallonge (-B. vobilior, Thomps.) in 

 the pike of Lake Superior, {E. boreus, Ag.) and in several others still confounded 

 w'iih. Esox estor oi Lesueur. On the oihexhdiX'id, Esox americauiis, Lacep. {E.niger 

 Lesn.) E. fasciatus, Dekay. E^ clathratus, Bd., MS., resemble Esox reticulatus 

 in having the cheeks and opercular apparatus covered with scales. 



Consequently there are two groups of species in the genus Esox, based upon an 

 organic difference, and for which we have two distinct names. The maskallonge 

 and allied species we ought henceforth to call Pikes ^ retaining the name oi Pickerels 

 for Esox reticulatus and allied species. 



The pikes, when full grown, are the largest of the genus ; amongst pickerels, 

 we find the smallest species. Esox reticulatus is the largest pickerel known, and 

 it is as larae as any of the specimens of Esox boreus which we have seen. 

 We would nevertheless be inclined to think that the latter reaches a much larger 

 size. 



The organic difference which we have pointed out between the pikes and 

 pickerels, corresponds to a curious fact in their geographical distribution in 

 North America ; the Pikes being confined to the great lakes and western waters 

 generally, whilst the Pickerels occur in such ponds and rivers whose waters 

 empty into the Atlantic. 



A pike has been introduced into the Connecticut river, and the fact that it has 

 multiplied there, is no objection to this general law of their distribution. 



A Pickerel is said to occur in the Ohio river. We have not seen any specimen 

 of this fish, the history of which ought to be carefully investigated. If a pickerel 

 was originally an inhabitant of that body of water, then we shall have one ex- 

 ception to the general rule. 



Lesueur has indicated under the names of Esox vermictilatus, E. lineatus and 

 E. depraudus, three species of the genus Esox from the Wabash river. As no 

 specimens are preserved any where, it will be difficult to identify them, even 

 upon visiting the place where they occur. But one feature can be easily deter- 

 mined, that is whether their cheeks and opercular apparatus are or are not 

 covered with scales. Any traveller will be prepared to make this observation. 

 Lesueur's Esox lugubrosus, from the eastern states, and Esox phalerutus, of 

 Say, from Eastern Florida, are likewise undetermined in this respect.

Note npon a nest constrticted hy Catfish 

 By Charles Gieard. 



A few days since, in visiting a small pond, situated above Schuylkill Falls vil- 

 lage, an innumerable quantity of small fish were seen along shore, near 

 the surface of the water. On approaching them they all suddenly disappeared, 

 and the water being muddy, we could not tell where they went. A scoop net 

 broujjht to light a subspherical mass, composed exclusively of green confervae, 

 and which after examination proved to be a regular nest, constructed, as we sup- 

 pose, by the parent fish, whose progeny it contained ; for in it. the small fishes 

 seen a moment before near the surface had gone to seek shelter. In all proba- 

 bility, the eggs were deposited in it, and when hatched, the young, instead of 

 dispersing themselves, remain for some time congregated, under the care of the 

 parent who provides food for them. 



The number of young fish gathered around the nest, was at least from three to 

 four hundred, and of different sizes. The largest were about li inch long, and 

 the smallest about | of an inch. This difference in size seems to us, as indicating 

 that eggs had been deposited and fecundated at different periods in the nest. 



They all had the abdomen distended like full grown individuals before spawn- 

 ing. But this was owing to the stomach gorged with food. The skin of the 

 belly was so tender that soon after death it was entirely decomposed, the intes- 

 tine and stomach then appearing outside of the abdominal cavity. 



The structure of the nest was very simple, confervae in strings were disposed 

 circularly all around. The size o{ the entire structure was about eight inches 

 in its longest, and six inches in its shortest diameter. There was at least one 

 opening to get in and out, but this portion of the nest we could not examine 

 thoroughly from the want of clear water ; and after having been kept for some 

 time out of the water, it was entirely deformed. 



The nest laid at the bottom of the pond, one foot and a half deep in that place, 

 and protected by aquatic plants growmg along shore. The water here is never 

 subjected to any violent motion; and thus the soft materials of which it was con- 

 structed, were resistant enough for that particular locality. 



We should think that under other circumstances, as, for instance, a current of 

 water, catfish would construct their nests of a substance more capable of resisting 

 a chance of destruction. 



Further observations will tell us more about this interesting subject, audit is 

 with the hope that some one, more favorably situated than we are, will devote 

 some attention to it, that we have brought before the Academy the very little 

 it was our good fortune to observe on this occasion.

1. PoMoiis BREViCEi'S, B. and G. Body subelliptical, rather short 5 head very 

 short, fore part convex and elevated; peduncle of tail of medium size. The 

 greatest depth is more than half of the length, the caudal fin excluded. The 

 origin of the dorsal fin is in advance of the opercular flap, and is composed of 

 eleven spiny rays and ten soft ones. The origin of the anal is under the first 

 >ott ray o( the dorsal, and contains nine soft and three spiny rays. The pos- 

 terior extremities of these two fins extend a little beyond the middle of the pe- 

 duncle of the tail. The caudal is slightly emar^inated posteriorly, and its 

 angles rounded; it is composed of seventeen fully developed rays and a few ru- 

 dimentary ones. The ventrals inserted behind the base of pectorals, extend by 

 their tips to the anus. 'I'he pectorals, composed of thirteen rays, do not reach 

 juite so far.

The scales are large, higher than long, and disposed in twenty rows on the 

 line of the greatest depth, and about eight rows on the peduncle of the tail. 

 The lateral line is very conspicuous, from head to tail, and very nnuch arched 

 on the body. 



The opercular flap is very large, broad and posteriorly rounded, and margined 

 with whitish. Irregular liaht lines are observed on the cheeks and opercular 

 apparatus. The color of the body appears to have been uniform reddish brown.

2. PoMOTis LoxGULus, B. and G. Body rather elongated, subfusiform; the 

 head conical and continuous with the body, save a little depression on the snout. 

 'J'he elouiiated appsarance of this species is owing to the head and peduncle of 

 the tail being longer than usual in this genus. The posterior tip of both dorsal 

 and anal fins do not reach the ba-^e of the caudal. The origin of the dorsal is 

 immediately above the membranous flap of the operculum ; it is composed of 

 ten spiny, or nine or ten soft rays. The anal is situated very far back, its an- 

 terior margin begins opposite to the fourth soft rays of the dorsal ; it has eight 

 soft rays and three spiny ones. 1 he caudal is slightly emarginate posteriorly, 

 and its anijles rounded. It is composed of seventeen fully developed rays and a 

 few rudimentary ones. The ventrals are placed under the pectorals ; their tips 

 when bent backwards do not reach the anus. The pectorals are subelliptical, 

 and extend as far back posteriorly as the ventrals.

On leave granted, Dr. Leidy made the following communication : 



Dr. John Evans, who is now engaged under the United States government to 

 survey part of Oregon, recently sent to the Academy for examination, ten boxes, 

 containing alarge quantity of mammalian and chelonian fossils, from the Mauvaises 

 Terres of Nebraska. In this large collection, it is worthy of ren^ark, there is 

 not to be found a single fragment of a bird or a fish bone. Most of the animals 

 indicated by the remains, have already been described in Dr. D. D. Owen's 

 Geological Report, and in the " Ancient Fauna of Nebraska" of the author. The 

 collection contains several new genera and species of mammalia, besides frag- 

 ments of important parts not before obtained of those species described. 



A very large proportion of the collection consists of remains of Oreodun^ of 

 which tiicre are fragments of about two hundred individuals. The species O, 

 Cidhertsonii predominates, and then follows O. gracilis ; while of O. major 

 there are very few fragments. This enormous quantity of remains of Oreodun, 

 would indicate that the animal was gregarious, and existed in immense herds like 

 the recent Peccary or Bison. 



Only a few small fragments of Poehtotheriwm Wdsonii and Agriochoeins 

 antiqnus are contained in the collection. 



Of the two species of Kldnoceros^ R. occidentalis and K. Nehrasreyisis, there 

 are remains of numerous individuals. 



Of Eiitelodon Mortoni the collection contains portions of several crania. 

 Of Anchitherium Bairdii there are four crania and numerous smuU fragments 

 of others. 



Of the huge Titavotherium Prontii there are numerous small fragments ot 

 bones and teeth ; and also several entire superior molars, which have served 

 to remove some of the obscurity in regard to the characters of the ai.imal. From 

 the last mentioned specimens it appears that those, which have been desciibed 

 as probably indicating a new species o{ Palceotherij(7n, under the name P. gigaii- 

 teum, (Ancient Fauna of Nebraska, pi. XVII, figs. 11-13,) belong to Titanothe- 

 ritim Proittiiy while several superior molars (lb. figs. 1-7), attributed to the latter, 

 belong to a new genus associating characters of Rhinoreros and Pulcrotheriirm. 

 For this genus and species, represented by figures 1-7, plate XVII, in the .-Ancient 

 Fauna of Nebraska, I propose the name of Kotherium American tivi. 



Of Machairodics primaevus there are preserved several crania and some other 

 bones. 



Of the new mammalia above referred to, there are four carnivora and one rumi- 

 nant. The carnivora consist of three species of HycBuoduii and a new genus. 

 The ruminant is a new genus closely allied to the recent Mosihus, These 

 interesting animals I propose to name as foll-ows : 



1. Hy>enodon HORRiDUS, Leidy. This is the largest of the three species above 

 referred to. It is founded upon a much fract'ired sktill and lower jaw ; but on 

 both sides of the specimen the teeth are preserved nearl}'^ perfect. The formula 

 of the dentition is as follows: 



3 17

1853.] 393 



This is the largest species of Hycenodon which has yet been discovered, the 

 skull measuring one (cot in length, whilst the length of the anterior cusp of the 

 last upper tnolar or carnassial tooth is one inch in length: and the inferior car- 

 nassial tooth measures fifteen lines antero-posteriorly. The series of lower molars 

 closely resemble those representee! in the upper left figure of plate XVII of 

 Blainville's " Subursi antiqiii" {Oat. Gen.) and the superior carnassial tooth is 

 like that represented in figures 3 3b. pi. XI. of Gervais' Zoologie Frangaise.

2. Hy.enodon CRriENTUS, Leidy. The second species is about the size of the

 fourth molars and the carnassial tooth.

3. Hy.exodox crucians, Leidy. The head of this species was almost the 

 size of that of the Prairie Wolf. The specimen upon which the species is founded 

 consists of the greater portion of a scull, containing on one side the posterior five 

 molar-, and on the other the anterior three molars, and of a lower jaw containing 

 all the molars on both sides except one.

1. Daphoenus vetus, L'idy. This new genus and species is proposed upon 

 a specimen of a cranium without the face, a fragment of a left upper maxilla con- 

 taining the posterior three molars, the posterior portion of the left side of the 

 lower jaw containing the last two molars, and a lower ante-penultimate molar of 

 the right side. 



The cranium is elongated and narrow and possesses very much the form of that 

 of the recent Paradoxar/"!. The glenoid articulation is transversely concave 

 as in the weasels, etc. The auditory bullae are comparatively small. Of the 

 superior posterior three molars, the last is the smallest, and has a simple oval 

 crown ; the penultimate is second in size and resembles that of the wolf, but is 

 broader in relation to its antero-posterior diameter; and the ante-penultimate is 

 the largest, and also resembles that of the wolf, but is more trilateral, relatively 

 broader compared with its antero-posterior diameter, and has less elevated 

 tubercles. 



Of the inferior posterior three molars, the last is smallest and very like that 

 of the wolf; the penultimate is next in size, and has an oval crown as in the wolf, 

 but has much less elevated tubercles; and the ante-penultimate, which is the 

 largest, in relation to the size of the animal, is much smaller than in the wolf, 

 but it has the same general form ; presenting a broad heel behind, worn oflf flat 

 in the specimen, and three lobes anteriorly, having the same relation to one an-

1. Leptomeryx Evansi, Leidy. This is established upon 

 has lost the nose, and is broken at the parietal region. The specimen contains 

 upon one side all the molars, six in number, and upon the other side the posterior 

 four molars ; and it is accompanied by a portion of the lower jaw containing the 

 true molars and the last premolar. 



The genus is closely allied to the existing MoschuSf^LnA the species was about 

 the size of the M. Javavicus. The six superior molars form a closed 

 row, in advance of which a hiatus exists. The true molars are composed 

 of four lobes resembling those of recent musks, but they possess a peculiar 

 generic distinction, which is a tubercle rising out of the base antero-inter- 

 nally of the postero-internal lobe, about one-third the size of the lobes themselves, 

 and appearing as if it was a rudimentary fifth lobe. The third premolar consists 

 of two lobes as in the musks, and the anterior two premolars in section are tri- 

 lateral and consist of a broad external and a narrow internal lobe. 



The lower true molars are like those of the musks, but in the last of the series 

 the ordinary fifth lobe of ruminants is notched so that there are actually six lobes 

 to the tooth. The last premolar is worn in the specimen into a surface, resem- 

 bling in some degree the figure 3 in shape. In comparison with Moschns Javanicus 

 the forehead of Leptomeryx Evayisi has about the same inclination forward and 

 is almost as broad ; but the sagittal crest is longer and the temporal fossa? are 

 more horizontal and more capacious ; the orbits are smaller and more directed 

 upward; the zygoma is deeper ; the post orbital arch is more vertical, and, if 

 the specimen is a correct representative of the species, it is open for about a line ; 

 the glenoid articulation is more deeply concave, and it possesses a strong post 

 glenoid tubercle; the auditory bullas are much smaller; and finally the inion is 

 broader.

The species I have named in honor of its discoverer. Dr. John Evans. 

 Of turtles the collection contains numerous carapaces, which present such a 

 gradation of form, size and growth to the fivl species described in the " Ancient 

 Fauna of Nebraska," that I feel doubtful whether there is more than one species 

 among them, for all appear to me to be only different ages of Testndo lata, the 

 only one which was represented as full grown, as indicated by the sutural con- 

 nexion of the costal with the marginal plates. 



(The specimens upon which were established the new species and genera in this 

 communication were exhibited by Dr. Leidy to the members.)

 Nut, reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings. 



Description of a new species of the Pdccine Nut. 



By John Le Conte. 



This species of Hickorea, which I found cultivated in Georgia, is a native of 

 the State of Texas. The small altitude which it attains, the later period of its 

 foliation, and the very different form of the nut, readily distinguish it from every 

 other hitherto described. I have adopted Mr. Rafinesque's name, Hickorea, for 

 the genus, in preference to Mr. Nuttall's Carya, on the ground of priority. What- 

 ever may have been the errors or aberrations of Rafinesque, Nuttall was not 

 justified in changing a name proposed by the former, years before any publication 

 of his own. 



Hickorea texana. Tree about ten feet high. Leaves 13 inches long, fre- 

 quently rather over than under this measurement, composed of 6 or 7 pairs of 

 leaflets, scarcely petiolated, with a terminal odd one on a rather long petiole ; 

 leaflets lanceolate acuminate, the lower ones more convex on the upper than the 

 lower edge, dentate on the uppV edge from about one third the distance from 

 the base ; the lower edge is always most entire, except a few small teeth near 

 the point. The terminal leaflet is dentate on both edges, but not near the base ; 

 nut somewhat ovate, pointed at the upper extremity, less so at the lower, flat- 

 tened, somewhat rough, and slightly angled ; 1-4 inch long, 1 inch broad. 



Diflfers from H. olivaeformis or common 

 Pacane nut, in being a much smaller tree, 

 seldom being more than 10 or 12 feet high, 

 whilst the other frequently reaches to 80 or 

 90 feet ; in the smaller size of the leaves, 

 which rarely exceed 14 inches in length, the 

 leaflets being 4 or 5 inches long, whilst the 

 H. olivaRformis has the leaves from 19 to 20 

 inches long and the leaflets 7 inches ; but 

 most peculiarly in the shape of the nut ; this, 

 in our species, is ovate, flattened, although 

 protuberant on the sides and rough; in the 

 o^her very smooth, cylindrical, pointed at 

 each end. The leaves of the H. olivaeformis

The Committee on Major Le Conte's descriptions of new Arvicolae, 

 reported in favor of publication. 



Description of three new species of Americati Arvicolce, with remarks upon some 



other American Rodents. 



By John Lk Conte. 



From amongst the smaller mammals of this country I select out the genus 

 Arvicola as a proper subject for a few remarks. Notwithstanding the researches 

 of those who have preceded me, I have, within the last year, detected three 

 species which have not yet been described. The object of my observations is 

 not so much to bring these before the world, as to settle the synonomy of those 

 which are already found in the books. The confusion among them is very great, 

 and apparently every day increasing. What may be the result of my endeavors 

 to enlighten this darkness, it is not for me to say. I can only hope that my con- 




1853.] 405 



elusions may not in any instance prove erroneous. I do not think that the short 

 and defective descriptions of others have misled me ; although such might well 

 have been the case. The following descriptions are made as full as possible, 

 for the time has past when short descriptions of half a dozen words can be of any 

 use ; the unusual number of objects claiming our attention at the present day in 

 the three kingdoms of nature, require them to be so drawn up that they never 

 can be too minute, nor their details too extended. 



The most inconceivable confusion has been introduced into Natural History 

 by the publication, a few years ago, of a Fauna of the United States. An author 

 who was scarcely capable of forming a scientific idea, introduced himself into a 

 place, which a more modest man would have hesitated to occupy, and by as- 

 suming discoveries to which he had no right, and imposing names of his own 

 upon animals which had long been known under other names, has dishonestly 

 attempted to rob the real discoverers of the credit to which they were entitled. 



Thus, the rubbish of synonomy has been increased, and doubt and uncertainty 

 introduced where all might have been plain and distinct. I beg leave to offer 

 a few instances of this author's conduct in this place ; others will be produced 

 hereafter. Harlsn, in his Fauna Americana, states that the Arvicola amphibius 

 of Europe is common in this country. Now, there is no proof that he ever saw 

 this animal living or dead. He gives a description which is translated verbatim 

 from Demarest, and shows a woful ignorance of the French langyage by trans- 

 lating '"' plus clair " clearer, instead of paler. Again, he tells us that the Mus 

 sylvaticus is a native of the United States ; and here again he makes free with 

 the Frenchman's words, and again mistranslates. This animal was never seen 

 living on this side of the Atlantic. 



In the following descriptions I have admitted nothing which could be con- 

 sidered common to all the species of any genus, such as the color of the teeth, 

 the hairiness of the posterior inner angle of the mouth, the squamosity of the 

 under side of the toes, or the color of the eyes ; all those matters merely fill up 

 space, and ought from the first to be known as unvarying generic, not specific 

 characteristics. Comparisons with other species mixed with the genuine cha- 

 racters, " notae collatitiae," so much reprobated by Linnaeus, have likewise been 

 studiously avoided.

Swims and dives well ; is found peculiarly on the marshes of those rivers 

 where the Zizania aquatica grows. As there is a considerable difference in the 

 t^eth of some of these animals, I have, whenever it was in my power, pointed 

 out their peculiarities. With the exception of one species which will be men- 

 tioned hereafter, they differ much from those of Europe. Unfortunately I have 

 not been able to obtain crania of many of those here described, otherwise certain 

 distinctive marks might have been obtained, which would have rendered their 

 determination much more easy.

 terior lobe of which is nearly obliterated, leaving a plane space from the end of 

 the tooth to the posterior triangle. 



From this arrangement it results, that the line of teeth in the upper jaw' con- 

 sists externally of 9 salient and 9 re-entering angles, the two last of each small, 

 and internally of 10 salient and 8 re-entering angles, exclusive of the interior 

 emargination of the treffle. 



In the lower jaw the first molar commences with a treffle, then follow C tri- 

 angles, 2 exterior, 3 interior and 1 posterior ; the second of 5 triangles, 2 exterior, 

 2 interior and 1 posterior ; the third of 3 triangles, 1 anterior, 1 intermediate 

 and 1 posterior: and the line of teeth is formed externally of 11 salient angles, 

 including the exterior lobe of the treffle, and 9 re-entering angles, including the 

 concavity of the side of the treffle, and internally of 11 salient and 11 re-entering 

 angles, including the lobe and the emargination of the treffle.

I have not, myself, met with this species any where but in Pennsylvania, but 

 I have heard of it in almost all the Northern States. It has been confounded by 

 Richardson with the A. noveboracensis of Rafinesque, which it very much re- 

 sembles, but is easily told by the longer and narrower head, and by a difference 

 in the upper incisors. Dr. Harlan, in his Fauna Americana, wishing to deprive 

 Mr. Ord of the merit of having first described the A. riparius, published this 

 species under the name of A. palustris, and quoted A. riparius as a synonym. 

 His own ignorance defeated him in this project, and made his ill faith more ap- 

 parent. Had he only been honest, he would have consulted Mr. Ord on the 

 identity of the two animals, and then might have justly claimed this species as 

 his own.

Hair long, soft and glossy, dark lead color, above tipt with brown intermixed 

 with longer black hairs, beneath tipt with shining grey. Head moderately blunt 

 and large, upper incisors very slightly sulcate on the inner edge ; lips white ; 

 ears oval, projecting a little beyond the fur, hairy both within and without ; an- 

 titragus large, semicircular, entirely closing the auditory passage; feet dark 

 brown, covered with short shining hair; thumb tubercle with a short, com- 

 pressed, blunt nail. Tail depressed, well covered with hair, black, beneath a litile 

 paler. 



Length 7 in. ; head 1*4 ; ears -25 ; fore leg -9 ; hind leg 1*7 ; tail 1-8. 

 The dentition is nearly the same as of the A. riparius. In the upper jaw the 

 posterior interior angle is furnished with a small, sharp, posterior lobe, and the 

 third nnolar of the lower jaw terminates in a roundish piece, which is so cut by 

 the last re-entering angle on its inner side as to form another interior salient 

 angle, whence the interior line of teeth in the lower jaw is composed of 12 salient 

 and 11 re-entering angles. 



This species, first described by Mr. Ord, is probably the one confounded by 




408 [October^ 



Pennant with the Arv. agrestis of Europe. It is very easily distinguished from 

 any otiier of the genus that I have seen in America, by the furrow on the inner 

 margin of the superior incisors, and by the large antitragus of the ear, which 

 completely closes up the auditory passage as with a valve, the last character 

 showing that it is peculiarly fitted for an aquatic life. It is generally pointed 

 out by American naturalists as the A. xanthognathus of Leach, a species which 

 I have never had the good fortune to see, and which I scarcely believe has ever 

 been found for from the Arctic regions. As for its habits, it delights in marshy 

 places, and swims and dives with much dexterity. It leaves the lower grounds, 

 however, and is often found in upland meadows. Formerly it was very common 

 in the vicinity of New York. This was before the advance of population on that 

 favored spot had destroyed everything connected with nature, except the vices 

 of man. 



There is generally quoted in connection with this species of Arvicola, a figure 

 in Wilson's Ornithology, vol. vi., pi. 50, which has nothing characteristic about 

 it, and may as well be said to represent anything else.

The dentition differs from that of A. riparius as follows : In the upper jaw the 

 second interior triangle of the first tooth is furnished with a small, sharp poste- 

 rior lobe, and the interior triangle of the second has likewise a sh?rp posterior 

 lobe, fn the lower jaw the first tooth is formed of 8 triangles, 1 anterior, which 

 may rather be called an oval, 1 posterior, 3 exterior and 3 interior. The line of 

 teeth in the upper jaw differs in having internally 9 salient and 9 re-entering 

 angles, and in the lower jaw in having externally 10 salient and 9 re-entering 

 angles, and internally 12 salient andll re-entering angles.

 short shining hair; thumb tubercle, with a compressed, curved nail ; nails of the 

 toes long and slender, naked (no hairs projecting over them as in every other 

 species.) Tail very short, blunt and hairy. 



Length 3-8 ; head 1-1 ; ears -15; fore leg ? ; hind leg -8; tail '7. 



The dentition of this species, and of the following, differs very much from that 

 of any others which I have examined. The molars in the upper jaw are precisely 

 like those of the conamon European species ; while in the lower jnw they are 

 widely different. Upper jaw: the first molar is composed of 5 triangles, 1 an- 

 terior, 2 exterior and 2 interior ; the second of 4 triangles, 1 anterior, 2 exterior 

 and 1 interior: the impressed spaces on the crowns of the teeth, in the posterior 

 interior trian^ile of the first and second teeth, are rectangularly oblong ; the third 

 molar is formed of three triangles, 1 anterior, 1 exterior and 1 interior, and ends 

 in a three-sided piece, which is rounded at its apex, and deeply cut into on the 

 interior side by the last re-entering angle. The upper line of dentition consists 

 externally, of 9 salient and 8 re-entering angles, and internally, of 8 salient and 

 7 re-entering angles. In the lovA^er jaw^ the first tooth begins with a trefiie, then 

 follow 6 triangles, 2 exterior, 3 interior and 1 posterior ; the secondof 5 triangles, 

 2 exterior, 2 interior and ] posterior ; the third is narrowed anteriorly, and formed 

 of 3 triangles, 1 anterior, 1 intermediate and 1 posterior. 



The lower line of teeth consists, externally, of 7 salient and 6 re-entering 

 angles, with two emarginations on the external face of the last tooth, internally, 

 of 11 salient and 10 re-entering angles. 



Previous to the year 1810, this little animal, although well known in the pine 

 region of lower Georgia for its depredations in the cultivated fields of the inhabit- 

 ants, had not made its appearance in the oak lands. The first one that I ever saw 

 was at that time brought to me as a great curiosity ; since then they have become 

 extremely common, and very destructive to sweet potatoes and ground nuts. 

 How long they have been known in South Carolina I have no means of ascer- 

 taining. 



Its life is wholly subterranean ; it is therefore never seen except when acci- 

 dentally or designedly turned up from beneath the surface. 



12. Arvicola scalopsoides. Capite magno et obtuso ,* auribus parvis margins 

 solo exteriore piloso, sub pilis occultis, tarso subpiloso. Supra castaneus subtus

Hair shining, plumbeous, above tipt with chesnut slightly mixed with blackish, 

 beneath cinereous tipt with gi;ey, the latter color tolerably distinctly separated 

 on the sides from the former. Head large and blunt ; ears rounded, hairy in- 

 wardly on the upper edge only, concealed under the fur ; antitragus small, semi- 

 siicular; whiskers grey, longer than the head ; feet covered with short shining,

 hair above and tipt with dark brown, beneath pale brown. 



Length 4-7 ; tail -8 ; head 1*2 ; ears -l? ; fore leg -8 ; hind leg 1'4. 



The dentition is precisely like that of the preceding, the A. pinetorum. 



I know nothing of the habits of this animal, but Conclude from its large eyes, 

 Ihat its life is not subterranean. 



The next genus which I shall examine is Hesperomys ; of this I have two new 

 species to describe, one from the North and one from the South, and as an ap- 

 pendage, shall add the Mus Leconteiof Bachman, which is a Reithrodon, and 

 neither a Mus nor a Hesperomys. 



Those American animals which were formerly arranged in the genus Mus, 

 have, from a more attentive examination, been removed to this. For a long time 

 naturalists hesitated where to place them; hence, we sometimes find them called 

 Arvicolae. Mr. Waterhouse finally gave them the name which they now bear. 

 Whether the illustrious author intended by this name to indicate their nocturnal 

 habits, or their western habitat, in either case it is perfectly appropriate. It 

 may well be doubted whether there is a single species of Mus really indigenous 

 to America. There is but one instance which makes me hesitate to assert this 

 positively. In Georgia there is a rat, inhabiting the middle parts of the State, 

 which Dr. Bachman considers as a variety of the Mus Rattus, from which, how- 

 ever, it appears to me to differ very considerably. How it could be imported 

 from abroad and only found in the interior of the country, and there not in cities 

 and among human habitations, I cannot conceive. Why has it not extended 

 everywhere as well as in the more southern States ? and why has nothing re- 

 sembling it ever bef?n described in Europe, whence we have undoubtedly received 

 the Mus Rattus? It may have been brought from Africa or some tropical region, 

 and therefore not able to bear any colder climate than that of Georgia or South 

 Carolina. 



The molars of Hesperomys vary from those of Mus in the following particulars : 

 They are proportionally longer and smaller. In Mus they have each three trans- 

 verse striae-tubercles ; in Hesperomys, the series of teeth present a double row of 

 tubercles not standing perfectly opposite each other, but more or less alternating, 

 and separated in the middle by a deep longitudinal furrow meandering among 

 them ; the inner ones of these tubercles in the upper jaw and the outer ones in 

 The lower, seeming to be formed by a reduplication in the sides of the teeth. All 

 the molars have some alternating indentations or folds of the enamel. The first 

 has 2 internally and 1 externally, the rest having one on each side, except H. 

 ieucopus, whirh in the second superior molar has 2 on each side, one of the exte- 

 rior being smaller. On the two first teeth of the upper jaw there is a small false 

 tubercle at the mouth of each of the indentations. The indentations and the tu- 

 bercles of the hindmost tooth, both above and below, become early obliterated. 

 In the lower jaw the number of tubercles are similar to what we find in the 

 upper, that is to say the first tooth has 5 tubercles, the second 4, and the third 3. 

 This is the structure of the dentition when the teeth are not altered by age and 

 long use ; when, however, the tubercles become ground down, the plicated figures, 

 which formerly were of a determinate and invariable form, become changed, and 

 finally vanish entirely, and the surface of the tooth becomes plain. When the 

 teeth of a Mus are abraded, there are formed on the surface simple oblique fur- 

 rows across their crowns. I begin with the largest of the genus.

In the short synonomy attached to this species there is more to be found than 

 at first sight meets the eye. It is with much regret that I find myself compelled 

 to adopt Harlan's name, and to consider the very appropriate one proposed by 

 Dr. Bachman as a synonym. The following explanatit)n of the circumstances 

 which force me to this will, I hope, be satisfactory. May it produce an effect 

 quite contrary to what was calculated upon by the author of the name. Dr. 

 Harlan was certainly the first describer of this animal. In natural science the 

 law of priority is inflexible ; and a fact made known by a vain and ignorant pre- 

 tender, or procured, as in the present instance, by dishonorable means, 

 is entitled to the same record as one discovered by the patient and sincere 

 searcher after truth. Dr. Bachman's observations on this subject, in the third 

 volume of the Quadrupeds of North America, seem to imply that, as the name 

 of Arvicola palustris is pre-occupied by Harlan himself, in Fauna Americana, 

 p. 136, the specific name could not be given to the animal before us ; but as it is 

 by no .means an Arvicola, and as Harlan called it a Mus, (as in his day it would 

 have been called by every one,) the objection is of no avail, and the name must 

 stand. Besides, the A. palustris of Harlan is itself, with him, a synonym of A. 

 riparius, but truly a synonym of A. nasutus ; the man's ignorance defeating his 

 dishonest intention to deprive Mr. Ord of the name. 



This rat inhabits the inland rice plantations of Georgia and South Carolina ; 

 dives and swims with the most perfect ease. It makes its nest among the rice 

 about two feet from the ground, but in the winter burrows in the dams ; is 

 very carnivorous, and so nearly resembles the Mus decumanus, or house rat, as 

 at first sight to be taken for it. It is readily distinguished by the shortness and 

 hairiness of the ears.

Hair dark plumbeous, above on the top of the head and back tipt with brown 

 and dusky, on the other parts with brownish tawny, lightest on the sides, be- 

 neath slightly with whitish and cinereous, so that the under side of the body 

 appears greyish, which color is rather abruptly separated from the tawny of 

 the sides, upon which it rises in a curve a little behind the fore legs. Head very 

 large ; nose long, projecting, dusky ; cheeks tawny ; lips white ; eyes large and 

 prominent ; ears large, round, erect, dusky, almost naked, with a few short, 

 brown, appressed hairs at the base. Nails covered by the hair of the toes. Tail 

 hairy, above dusky, beneath brown. 



Length of head and body 4-5; tail 3 inches ; head 1*5 ; ear length -67, breadth 

 66 ; fore leg 1*1 ; hind leg 1*9 ; tarsus '8. 



Younger individuals are not so tawny on the sides as the older. This species 

 is considered by Dr. Bachman as a variety of the next. It is, however, three 

 times as large, and lives in a different manner. It forms its nest under logs and 

 under the bark of decaying trees, generally of cotton, frequently using more than 

 a pound of this material for the purpose. 



Fifty years ago this mouse was scarcely known *to the inhabitants of the 

 southern parts of Georgia. Since then they have become extremely common,- 

 have left the fields and woods, and taken up their abode in barns and dwelling 

 houses. In the year 1809 I first saw and; for my private satisfaction, made a 

 description of this animal. The specimen was a female ; and when caught, had 

 two young ones attached to her tail, with which she was endeavoring to escape. 

 I never saw but one other for "several years after, I then found, probably in the 

 year 1822, that no animal of this kind was more numerous over the whole 

 of that part of the country. 



It differs from the next, H. leucopus, more obviously, in the nose being more

prominent, the head larger, and the fore ieet not being so different in length from 

 the hind as to cause its usual mode of progression to be by leaps. The propor- 

 tion between the fore and hind feet in this species being as 1 to 1*75, whereas 

 in H. leucopus it is as 1 to 2.

Hair dark plumbeous, above tipt with tawny or dark orange, on the top of the 

 head and back with brown and tawny, beneath, for at least two-thirds of the 

 length of the hair with snowy white ; the tawny color of the ."sides very bright, 

 and abruptly separated from the snowy color of the belly, the line of separation 

 very distinct and well defined, and curved upward on the sides both before and 

 behind the forelegs. Head moderately blunt; eyes prominent, black and very 

 lively ; nose and lips white ; cheeks bright tawny ; ears large, erect, oval, blunt, 

 nearly naked, being furnished with short, closely appressed hairs, not in very 

 great quantity, and narrowly margined with whitish. Fore legs generally white on 

 all sides ; hind legs outwardly tawny, inwardly white ; feet pale flesh color, with 

 closely appressed white hairs projecting beyond the nails. Tail above brownish 

 dusky, beneath cinereous brown. In winter the fur frequently becomes darker 

 colored, being over almost all the upper parts dark cinereous mixed with tawny. 



Length in. 3-9 ; head 1-2 ; ears height -55, width '35 ; fore leg -9 j hind leg -18; 

 tail 2-9; tibia and tarsus 1'8. 



Specimens are brought from California and from Oregon that are above much 

 darker colored ; the plumbeous color of the lower portion of the hair appearing 

 more distinctly among the tawny tips, which are thus rendered but here and 

 there visible ; the upper color is separated Irom that of the belly as distinctly as 

 in others ; the outer side of the fore legs, however, is not white, but of the color 

 of the back. In other specimens, the upper parts are more uniformly brownish 

 tawny, and the belly not so white; the fore legs also are of a dull white. In 

 none of them are the white parts so beautifully snowy. All of them that I have 

 seen had been preserved in alcohol, and were, therefore, more or less unfit for 

 description. There may be really distinct species among them. 



This animal burrows in the ground, forming long galleries, and proves very 

 destructive in gardens. It becomes, in some places, impossible to cultivate 

 certain species of bulbous roots, as hyacinths, tulips,&c., without some contrivance 

 by which they may be protected from their depredations. The best method 

 which I have seen used was, surrounding each root with a flower pot, the bottom 

 of which was knocked out. The robber does not penetrate very deep into the 

 earth, he is thus quickly stopped in his progress, and forced to look elsewhere 

 for food. Their usual mode of progression when on the su)face is by leaping, 

 hence th^nr name of Jumping Mouse. The name of Deer Mouse is given in Ca- 

 nada to the two species of Jaculus ; it is only used in that country, as the Jaculi 

 are so seldom seen in the United States as to be only known to naturalists. In 

 the winter they enter houses, particularly cellars, and support themselves in the 

 same manner as the Mus musculus. In green houses they are extremely de- 

 structive to cacti and other succulent plants. I have never known them to form 

 their nests in trees, or to occupy deserted birds' nests ; it is another species of 

 this genus which has this habit. This species I have found it impossible to obtain, 

 although formerly quite numerous in the vicinity of New York. M. de Selys 

 Longchamps, in his Micro-mammalogia, pp. 66 and 67, makes some observations 




1853.] 



413 



on this mouse, and proves that it cannot be the same as the Mus sylvaticus of 

 Europe ; he calls it Mus noveboracensis. I cannot find whence he got this name, 

 but should rejoice much to find that it had been proposed by some naturalist 

 before Rafinesque, that we might get rid of the Greek name which is now indis- 

 solubly attached to it. 



4. Hesp. campestris. Supra fuscus, subtus cinereo-fuscus. Capite magno, 

 auribus magnis, ovalibus, obtusis, pilis brevibus sparse vestitis. 



Hab. In Nova Caesarea. 



Hair plumbeous black, above tipt with brown, beneath with cinereous brown, 

 darker about the mouth. Head large.; ears large, oval, blunt, thinly covered 

 both within and without, with very short, closely appressed hair. Legs and feet 

 brown. Tail well clothed with tolerably long hair. 



Length in. 3-4; head 1-2 ; ears 55'; width -4; fore leg -45 ; hind leg 1-6; 

 tail 2-7. 



This species was found in the collection of the Academy, and labelled Mus 

 campestris, from New Jersey. The specimens were preserved in alcohol, and 

 therefore scarcely fit to be described ; there was, however, enough to show that 

 they were different from any hitherto described animal. 



5. Hesp. sonoriensis. Supra saturate cinereus fuscescente-cano leviter inter- 

 mixtus, subtus albescens. Capite elongato, auribus magnis. Cauda modica. 



Hab. In provincia Sonorae. 



Hair above dark cinereous or slate color, slightly mixed with brownish grey, 

 more thickly on the head, nose, and behind the ears, and with grey on the sides; 

 beneath whitish, except on the throat, which is mixed slate-color and whitish. 

 Head elongated, pointed ; ears large, oval, hairy both within and without, and 

 with a distinct narrow grey margin. Feet covered with short, whitish brown 

 hair. Tail moderate, above dark brown, beneath paler. 



Length in. 3*3; head 1'2 ; ears '4; fore leg ! ; hind leg 1'8 ; tail l-D. 



Resembles in some degree the H. leucopus. Collected by the Boundary Com- 

 mission, under Major Graham. 



These are all the species of this genus of which I have specimens at present. 

 Messrs. Audubon and Bachman describe in addition, H. humilis, H. aureolus, H. 

 caroliniensis and H. mlchiganensis under the genus Mus. With all of these, ex- 

 cept the last, I was well acquainted forty years ago. 



I cannot omit saying something here of an animal described by Dr. Dekay in 

 the Zoology of the State of New York, vol. i. p. 31, under the name of Mus 

 Americanus. This is certainly a Hesperomys, or a species of one of the allied 

 genera, and not a Mus rattus, as Dr. Bachman supposes. It is some years ago 

 since it was found in the city of New York, and handed to me for examination 

 by Mr. John G. BeJl. I took the following notes of it at the time, and had it 

 passed to Dr. Dekay, who was then engaged in writing the Zoology of the State. 



The animal was above and beneath of a uniform dark plumbeous black in- 

 clining to dusky ; head rather blunt ; eyes prominent ; ears oval, blunt, externally 

 naked, internally sparsely hairy. Feet small, covered with short shining hair ; 

 toes white. Tail short ; terete, annulosely scaly. 



Length of head and body 9-3 ; tail 5*6 ; head 2*4 ; ears '75 ; width -45. 



Reithrodon Lecontei. Supra rufo, fusco et nigrante mixtus, subtus albidus ; 

 naribus carunculatis, labris tumidis. Auribus magnis. 



Hab. In Georgia. Mus Le Contii Bachman, Jour. Acad. Nat. Sc, vol. viii. 

 p. 307. 



Hair plumbeous, above tipt with rufous, dark brown and dusky, the latter color 

 prevailing more on the back. Forehead much arched; eyes large; lips tumid; 

 nostrils each furnished beneath with a small caruncle pointing downwards; ears 

 oval, large, hairy both within and without. Feet very pale flesh color, covered 

 with short cinereous brown hairs. Tail long, nearly naked, above brown, be- 

 neath paler. 



Length in. 2-5 ; head '8 ; ears -2^ fore leg -5 ; hind leg '8 ; tail 2 inches.

Very much resembles the common mouse. Burrows in the earth and comes 

 out at night to eat. Its food appears to consist chiefly of green vegetables. 



In the preliminary remarks to this memoir, I alluded to a species of Mus in- 

 habiting the Southern States, which might be considered as native and not im- 

 ported, which was mentioned in Audubon and Bachman's Quadrupeds as a variety 

 of Mus rattus. This animal was known many years ago to Seba, Klein and 

 Brisson, and figured or described by them. The following description of it 

 made many years ago, although some what imperfect, may help to pomt it out. 



Mus Amehicanus. Hair dark cinereous, above tipped with reddish brovv^n, 

 and dusky with many long scattering hairs of the latter color, beneath with 

 vjrhite, having a tinge of yellow particularly towards the sides. Ears rather 

 large, oval, blunt, naked. Feet whitish, covered with short hairs. Thumb tu- 

 bercle furnished with a short blunt nail. Tail terete, long, annulosely scaly, 

 furnished with short hair.

This rat was formerly very common in the midland counties of Georgia. I, 

 however, know nothing of its habits. The following measurements were taken 

 from many different specimens. Length of head and body 7.74 ; tail 7.8 ; head 

 2.05 ; ears .9. 



Mus ViRGiNiANUs. Color entirely white. Ears, feet and tail flesh color. 

 Eyes brown. Ears moderate, blunt, naked. Feet thinly covered with short 

 hair; thumb-tubercle with a short blunt nail. Tail thick, rather blunt, quad- 

 rangular, the upper side convex, the others plane, annulosely scaley, with short 

 hairs proceeding from the base of the rings.

In the year 1840, a ship arrived at New York, from Tampico, which was over- 

 run with rats of this species ; a number of them were given to Mr. J. J. Audubon, 

 who made a drawing of the animal and kindly gave me one, from which the 

 above description was made ; it is not as full and perfect as it might be, as I had 

 no thought at the time of ever publishing it. The cranium differed in many respects 

 from that of the M. decumanus, to whichit appeared evidently allied, althougn 

 the tail was so different. I shall close these observations with a few remarks 

 on some other Rodentia. 



Neotoma FLORiDANUM. Is by no means confined to the southern states, three 

 individuals having been taken by Mr. Bell, of New York, near Nyack, on the 

 western bank of the Hudson river, about twenty miles above the city. One of 

 these was considerably larger than any I had ever seen, the head and body mea- 

 sured 11 inches, the tail 7.5. 



This animal was first described by Mr. Ord, in the Bulletin of the Societe 

 Philomathique de Paris, in the year 1818, under the name of Mus floridanus, and 

 afterwards in the Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences, of this city, as 

 Neotoma floridana. Harlan arranged it under the genus Arvicola, from which it 

 differs very much in its dentition, as well as in other respects. It is the Ameri- 

 can rat of Pennant, Arct. Zool., vol. i., p. 130, w^here he confounds it with a 

 Siberian animal described by Pallas. 



SiGMODON HispiDUS. This animal is subject to considerable variation in the 

 rniJdle molar of both jaws, which has usually but one external and one internal 

 enamel fold on each side, sometimes, however, there are two external folds, the 

 additional one being anterior and smaller. 



We are indebted to Mr. Ord for the first published notice of this rat, which 




1853.] 415 



appeared in the Journ. A. N. S., vol- iv. p. 352. It is described by Harlan in his 

 Fauna as Arvicola hortensis, and afterwards in Silliman's Journal, vol. x. p. 285, 

 under a different name, Arvicola ferrugineus. When Mr. Ord first brought this 

 animal from Florida, he deposited his specimen in the Philadelphia Museum, in 

 care of Mr. Peale, w^ith a particular injunction against its getting into the hands 

 of any one else. Dr. Harlan, who had free admission to this institution at all 

 times, went there when he knew no one would be present, took the specimen 

 away, and afterwards described it under the very inappropriate name of Arvicola 

 hortensis. The consequence of this, to say the least of it, unfair conduct, was a 

 positive banishment from the Museum for the future. Somewhat of a similar 

 manoeuvre caused him, sometime after, to be banished by the police from the city 

 of Paris. 



In the plates to the voyage of the French ship Venus there is figured a rat, 

 which is called Neotoma Floridana, which probably belongs to this genus, and 

 may be considered as a new species. The teeth have no resemblance to those 

 of a Neotoma, which, like those of Arvicola, are formed of triangles. Not being 

 able to refer to the text of this work, it is impossible to say of what country it 

 is a native. It may have been found on the western coast of our continent, in 

 California or Oregon. 



The name by which the Sigmodon is known in Georgia is the Small Wood Rat, 

 the Neotoma being called simply Wood Rat. They both keep at a distance from 

 houses, concealed in the woods or hedge rows. 



I conclude this rambling part of my paper by stating that, of the two Jaculi 

 found in this country, the Labradore Rat of Pennant, Arct. ZooU, vol. i. p. 132, 

 since called Dipus, and Meriones, but now Jaculus, has very large ears, and is 

 the same as the Gerbillus leonurus of Rafinesque. The Jaculus Canadensis has 

 very small ears, and may thus be easily distinguished ; they are both called Deer 

 Mouse by the inhabitants of Canada. 



The Committee on Major Le Conte's paper on Crotalus durissus and 

 C. adamanteus, reported in favor of publication. 



Observations on the so-called Crotalus durissus find C. adamanteus of moderTf, 



authors. 



By John Le Conte. 



Cuvier, in .his ^' Regne Animal," in a note on* the genus Crotalus, observes, 

 that the Linnean specific names of horridus and durissiis have been in different 

 ways changed between these two species. He was perfectly correct in this ; 

 and any one consulting the authors who have written on reptiles, will, in my 

 opinion, be at no loss to determine what the illustrious Swede meant by these 

 two specific names. In the Southern States we have but two species of Crotalus, 

 as the genus is now restricted. They are familiarly known as the Pine Barren 

 and the Oak Ridge rattlesnakes. Until it is possible to determine how either of 

 these was named by Linnaeus, and I cannot doubt that he had seen them both, I 

 hope I may be pardoned if I use these popular names to distinguish them from 

 each other. The first has, by English authors of the last century and by Cuvier, 

 been considered the horridus, and the other by Shaw and Pennant, as the diiris- 

 sus ; in the last case manifestly improperly, as will appear hereafter. In order, 

 however, to elucidate this matter, I will commence with the descriptions given 

 by Linnaeus in the twelfth edition of his Systema Naturae, the publication of 

 which he superintended himself in the year 1766, and by Graelin in his edition 

 of the year 1798. 



Crotalus horridus. Scutis 167, scutellis 23. 



. Mus. Ad. Frid., p. 39. Brad. Natur., tab. ix. fig. 1. Seba, Mus., vol. ii. tab. 



xcv. fig. 1. 




416 [October, 



This we may say is no description at all. But referring to the Museum regis 

 Adolphi Friderici, we find the following : 



Crotalus horridzts. Caput ad latera postice gibbum. Frons tecta squammis 

 obtusissimis, quarum elevatus margo. Palpebrae superiores planae, magns. He 

 refers to Catesby for an account of its habits, who has described and figured a 

 serpent with transverse bands on the back ; and also to a figure in Seba's Mu- 

 seum, vol ii. tab. xcv., which represents one with rhombic spots. This shows 

 how incorrectly references to figures can be made : " Quando que bonus dor- 

 mitat Homerus." 



Gmelin, in his edition, adds to Linnaeus Bodaert, Nov. Act. Acad. Caesar., 

 vol. vii. p. 16 Crotalus '"raaculis trigonis fuscis. Caudisona terrifica Laurenti, 

 p. 93. Michael. Gott. Mag. iv. 1, p. 90. 



Ttiis only tends to make the confusion greater. The animal which Bodaert 

 described could not be one with diamond shaped spots on the back ; there is no 

 difficulty in distinguishing a triangle from a quadrilateral figure, it therefore 

 could not have been a species with rhombic spots. In all the individuals of the 

 species with transverse fasciae, which I have ever examined, these bands were 

 more or less broken up, especially in front, in which the marks formed more or 

 less perfect chevrons, and might easily be called triangles. 



The Caudisona terrifica of Laurenti is our North American species with rhom- 

 boidal spots, and is thus described by the illustrious Italian : " Corpore carinis 

 squammarum exasperato (mari) cinereo-flavo (feminae) spadiceo, maculis dorsi 

 rhomboidalibus, magnis, ex nigro fuscis, albo limbo cinctis, apicibus subcon- 

 tiguis, per summum dorsi caudamque concatenatis. Hab. In America infra 

 gradum, elev. 45. 



The other species durissus is thus described by Linnaeus : 



Crotalus durissus. Scuta 172, Scutellis 23. 



Amcenitat. Acad., i. p. 500. Seba Mus., ii. tab. xcv. fig. 2. Gronov. Mus., 

 ii. p. 70. 



Albo flavoque varius, maculis rhombeis nigris disco albis. Gmelin adds to 

 these references, Bodaert, 1. c No. 2, Crotalus albus maculis rhombeis. Laurenti, 

 p. 93, Caudisona durissus. Weigel, Act. Soc. Hal., i. p. 7. Catesby, Carolina, 

 ii. tab. xli., who figures a species with transverse bands, and not with rhom- 

 boidal marks. Vosmaer Monog. Crotalus fasciis coUique duabus nigris. Now, 

 from all this we may collect that there are three species described, very distinct 

 from each other, but strongly mixed together; one with rhombic spots, the discs 

 of which are white ; one with rhombic spots, the limb or margins of which are 

 white ; and one with triangular spots. I proceed now to show what the three 

 species are^i and shall commence with the first, of which we have a fair speci- 

 men in our collection, which is named C. horridus, because it agrees with Seba's 

 figure as misquoted in the description of that species, but which agrees so well 

 with the description of another, that one would think it never could have been 

 mistaken. 



Crotalus durissus, Linn. 



Fusco et flavo varius maculis per dorsum magnis rhombeis nigris, disco flaves- 

 centibus, non-concatenatis. Capite parte priore fascia-inter oculos transversa, 

 summo et cervice lineis duabus longitudinalibus alteraque laterali nigris, spatiis 

 intermediis flavescentibus. Scuta abdominalia 167, subcaudalia 21, primo bifido, 

 sciitellorumque ad basin crepitaculi paria Iria.

 Cuvier Regne animal ii., p. 67. Id. Lacepede, ii. p. 423. Shaw, vol. iii. p. 333. 

 C. horridus Daudin, vol. v. p. 311. Id. Latreille, vol. iii. p. 186. 



A very good figure of this species is found in Vosmaer, which has been copied 

 by Shaw. 



Varied with dark brown and yellowish, with a row of large black rhombic 

 spots, the discs of which are yellowish, down the back, and which are not joined 

 together or concatenated ; these rhombs towards the tail gradually become less 

 distinct, until at last they vanish, so that the hinder part of the body may be 

 aid to be only varied with black and yellowish. The tail is perfectly black on 




1853.] 



417 



all sides; the body beneath is yellowish, varied and blotched with dusky more 

 distinctly and closely on the hinder part and on the sides. Head very large, with 

 a black stripe from the eye to the corner of the mouth, and a transverse bar of 

 the same color across the head just in front of the eyes, and joining the former 

 stripe at the eye. Top of the head and neck with two longitudinal, black stripes, 

 and another likewise on the side of the neck, the intervening spaces being yel- 

 lowish. Rostral plate triangular, the apex sharp, pale brown or yellowish ; there 

 are two roundish yellow plates on each side of this, and two likewise between 

 them on the top of the head, which are brownish and triangular, the apices point- 

 ing forward ; behind them there is a narrow transverse bar of yellowish, and 

 another of black, which is succeeded by a third one of yellow formed'of four 

 roundish scales, those near the eyes very large, the other rather smaller ; the 

 head is otherwise covered with tolerably large scales. 



Length 4 feet 4 inches, with three rattles. Circumference of the body 8 inches. 



In the description of Crotalus durissus, both Linnaeus and Laurenti agree that 

 the rhombs on the back have their discs white ; and the former, in the Amceni- 

 tales Academicae, says, that the area between the eyes is blackish, and has a 

 broad transverse white line. We ought not to hesitate one moment in declaring 

 that this species is not the korridus. The ground color of all the specimens 

 which have been examined in Europe appears to have faded, therefore, the parts 

 of the descriptions relating to this are of little value. It may be observed of 

 reptiles in general, that parts of the body which when living weie black, fre- 

 quently change to grey or even white, when kept for any length of time in al- 

 cohol. The specimen from which the preceding description was taken, in parts 

 which were originally black or dark brown, had become cinereous by the peeling 

 off of the epidermis, and if this process had been carried on for the whole length 

 of the body, scarcely any of the distinguishing characteristics would have been 

 apparent. 



Having thus determined what the Crotalus durissus of Linnaeus is, I proceed 

 to describe the two species which we have in the Atlantic States, calling them 

 by their vulgar names, and leaving it to each naturalist to determine by what 

 names they ought to be distinguished. 



Thr pine barren rattle snake. 



Pallide rufescente fuscus ad nigrum tendens. Dorso fasciis transversis, ir-

 A very excellent figure, shewing the animal in its highest state of perfection. 

 Above pale reddish brown, somewhat duskyish, frtiquently with a yellowish or 

 reddish vertebral line. Body with numerous transverse, irregular, serrate fasciag 

 of dusky or black, more or less interruptedly bordered with whitish. These 

 fasciae gradually diminish in distinctness towards the tail ; as the color becomes 

 darker or more dusky the bands become entire. Tail black on all sides, barred 

 with paler. Body beneath whitish, thinly speckled with dusky. Head with a 

 broad, dark brown line extending from the eye along the cheek to the corner of 

 the mouth; often, however, it is almost entirely black ; eyes red; neck very 

 slender, most frequently with two short longitudinal black lines on the top. 

 Rostral plate triangular ; supernasals, one on each side, externally rounded; or- 

 bital and antocular plates large. Scales of the head small, resembling coarse 

 shagreen. Body beneath whitish, thinly speckled with dusky. Abdominal scuta 

 170 to 178; subcaudal 18 to 25, with two pair of scales at the base of the rattle. 

 The male is generally to be distinguished by a black spot behind the occiput. 




418 [October, 



The transverse bars are frequently broken up, particularly in front, and the 

 larger portions form perfect chevrons. 



The young are yellowish, with irregular dusky marks on the back and sides, 

 the larger ones being transverse ; none of them, however, are serrate, as in the 

 older animals ; instead of a rattle there is a small button at the end of the tail. 



Grows to the length of 8 feet ; one of this size had 9 rattles, whilst another of 

 5 feet had 14. Specimens of the rattles of these snakes have been shown con- 

 sisting of thirty joints ; these are fictitious, and made by taking the separate 

 " grelots" from different rattles and joining them together, for they may be fitted 

 in su'h a manner that the deception cannot be perceived. Had 1 not seen this 

 artificial junction made in my presence, I should have considered these long 

 " crepitacula" as really natural.

Above black or brown, with a row of large black or dusky rhomboidal spots 

 on the back, which on the limb or margin are whitish or yellowish, and on the 

 disc mixed with brown ; these rhomboids are connected together, so that the 

 animal appears to have two yellowish lines running down the back and mutually 

 crossing each other from right to left at certain intervals ; they gradually become 

 less distinct towards the tail until they vanish, some of the posterior ones 

 changing into transverse bands. The sides of those which are brown are marked 

 with two rows of dusky spots ; those which are black, of course, must want these 

 SDots. Tail with alternate bars of black and yellowish, or black and dusky. 

 Body beneath yellowish, mixed and spotted with dusky. Head very large, spot- 

 ted with paler, with two yellowish and three black or dusky stripe.s on each side, 

 sometimes entirely black, the top covered with small scales resembling coarse 

 shagreen. Rostral plate pen! angular, wider and rounded at the base; supernasal 

 plates two, small, a larger quadrangular space between the rostral and nasal ; 

 Ijehind the rostral is a large plate on each side, immediately behind these are 

 two others ; the palpebras are large, transversely striate ; antocular plate large. 

 Abdominal scuta 170 to 178 ; subcaudal 23 to 32, and 4 pair of scales at the base 

 of the rattle. 



Length 6 feet with 6 rattles. 



I come now to the conclusions which are to be drawn from the preceding re- 

 marks - and first, the so-called horridus,\\\e Boiquira and Cascarella of many 

 authors, is the durissus of Linnaeus. I place little reliance on references to en- 

 graved figures, as in many instances they are made in a very careless manner. 

 Thus,we find Linnceus quoting a figure in Seba's Museum, which does not tally with 

 descriptions of other authors quoted by himself; and Laurenti, an author in other 

 respects very cautious and accurate, refers to a figure in Catesby, of a serpent 

 with transverse bars, as representing one with rhombic spots. We are driven^^^ 

 it appears to me, into this dilemma: either the name o{ horridns must be stricken 

 out from acknowledged species, or given to that one' which is called by so many 

 durissus, or, we must call this last one horridus, and thus have the species with 

 two distinct names. For, as I have observed elsewhere, there can be no doubt 

 of the animal, so well described by both Liunoeus and Laurenti, beins^ durissus. 

 Secondly, as for the other species, which Palisot de Beauvois called adamanteus, 

 and which others have named rhomUfer, &c., whether it was known to Linnaeus 

 cannot now be proven, although, for my own part, I have no doubt but that he 

 confounded it with the South American species, or it may be the dryinas which 

 had lost its color. See Amanitatis Academicae, vol. i. p. 501, where he says 




1853.] 419 



that many names and synonyms which have been given to C. dryinaa will also 

 be common to C. durissus. The name of adamanteus must be changed to 

 that of terrificus^ as this last has the priority in date by thirty years. Others 

 may think otherwise but 



Rumpat et serpens iter institutum, 



Si per obliquum similis sagitta 



Terruit mannos. 



A few words concerning the habits of these serpents. Their vaunted gene- 

 rosity in giving warning to those who approach them, is a ridiculous fable ; in 

 most cases they inflict their deadly wounds without sounding an alarm, and show 

 themselves extremely vicious by making unprovoked attacks upon every thing 

 that comes within their reach. With regard to their venom and the many anti- 

 dotes which at different limes have been pronounced infallible, I can safely de- 

 clare that, in no instance where the fang has entered the body so as to penetrate 

 one of the larger veins, has a recovery been known. Inevitable death is the 

 consequence. They tell us that they cannot hurt deer or swine ; the reason 

 is obvious ; the first has long legs with scarcely any muscular substance on them, 

 and therefore no veins of any size; and in the case of the other, no snake's fang 

 is long enough to pass through the skin and fat so as to meet a part obnoxious to 

 the poison. I should have observed before, that a complete solution of the blood 

 in the whole body is the immediate cause of death from the bite of a Crotalus. 



Palisot de Beauvois, in the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, 

 has said, that these snakes have no fetid odor emanating from them ; that in the 

 presence of any number of them, no disagreeable smell is perceptible. On the 

 contrary, I know from repeated experience, that their vicinity may generally be 

 discovered by the fetor w^hich they exhale, and that it is so strong when proceed- 

 ing from one that is enraged, as to occasion a considerable degree of sickness of 

 some hours duration. Most snakes emit a smell by no means pleasant ; this has 

 always been known, and is stronger and more deleterious in those which are 

 venomous than in those which are not. ^lartial, in one of his epigrams, says : 



Quod vulpes fuga, viperae cubile 



Mallemquam quod oles olere Bassa. 



There is another fact connected with these snakes as well as many others, 

 which has been the subject of much discussion. I allude to what has been called 

 the power of charming smaller animals upon which they prey. This has been 

 attributed to some secret fascinating power in the serpent. It has also been 

 attributed to the fright experienced at the sight of so formidable an enemy. If 

 it be said that the bird or the squirrel, in this predicament, fixedly gazed upon by 

 the terrible eyes of the serpent, could easily make its escape, the answer is, that 

 the unaccountable behaviour of the poor victim arises from its anxiety for its 

 young. The only instances in which I have seen snakes endeavoring to get pos- 

 session of birds, was at a time of the year when they had no young to take care of. 

 Squirrels generally have their nests on such lofty trees in our forests, that it is 

 very doubtful whether a snake's range of vision could reach so far, therefore, it 

 must be sonriething more than fear which can brins a squirrel down from his se- 

 cure habitation, one hundred or one hundred and fifty feet from the ground, to 

 become the easy and unresisting prey of a serpent. If he should be surprised on 

 the ground, what prevents him from ascending the next tree and soon losing him- 

 self among the foliage of those which are in the neighborhood. I do not attempt 

 to explain the thing, but call the attention of the reader of these observations to 

 the behaviour of cats to birds, and of cats and dogs to men when they wish to 

 obtain any thing from them. If there is any fascination in the steadfast gaze of 

 the eyes, they attempt to employ it upon us. 



It may not be out of the way at the end of these lines, to correct an error 

 which is now current among naruralists, which is, that the fangs in the genus 

 Elaps are always and permanently perpendicular, and not laid back as in other 

 venomous serpents. This is not the case. Upon examining fresh killed speci- 

 mens, I find them placed exactly as they are in a rattlesnake, and erected in the 

 same way when they wish to bite, that is by throwing back a part of the upper 




420 [October, 



jaw; for notwithstanding all that has been said of their harmless nature, they will 

 strike as any other venomous snake will, as T experienced last spring with 

 one of the largest I have ever seen. Moreover, in some foreiojn specimens of this 

 genus, if the fangs were always perpendicular in the jaw, the mouth would not 

 be closed without their piercing entirely through the lower lip.

 in favor of publication. 



Descriptions of nevj species of Reptiles, collected hy the IT. S. Exploring Expedi- 

 tion, under the command of Capt. Charles Wilkes, U, S. iV. 

 Second Part. Licluding the species of Batrachians, exotic to North America, 



By Charles Girard. 



Taking for our guidance the structure of the vomerine or palatine teeth, that 

 of the tympanum and tongue, we have been led to subdivide the genus Cystigna- 

 tluts as understood byDumeril and Bibron, in the "Erpetologie generale." The 

 structure of the fingers and toes have afforded accessory characters which are 

 not to be neglected, although comparatively less important. 



Leptodactylus, Fitz. Vomerine teeth disposed in two transverse series, each 

 constituting either an angular arch or a regular curve, and situated behind the 

 inner nostrils. Tongue slightly notched posteriorly. Tympanum very distinct. 

 Toes either provided with a rudimentary membrane or entirely free. 



Obs. Leptodactylus ocellatus, Fitz. (C ocellatus^ Dum. and B.), L. la- 

 BYRiNTHicus {Rana lahyrinthica, Spix ; C.lahyrinthicivs, Dum. and B.), and L. 

 TYPHONius, Fitz. (C. typhonius, Dum. and B.), belong to this genus. 



Cystignathus, Wagl. Vomerine teeth disposed upon a transverse or oblique 

 row, more or less interrupted in the middle, and situated either between the 

 inner nostrils or behind them. Tongue circular, subcircular or subcordiform, 

 posteriorly entire, and either attached by its whole surface, or very slightly free 

 behind. Tympanum distinct. Toes either bordered by a membranous fold or 

 slightly vv^ebbed at their base. 



Obs. Cystignathus macroglossus, C. gracilis and C. roseus of Dumeril and 

 Bibron will remain in this genus. 



Pleurodema, Tsch. Vomerine teeth disposed in two oblong groups situated 

 between the inner nostrils. Tongue subcircular, either slightly emarginated or 

 entire posteriorly. Tympanum indistinct. Toes either entirely free, or else 

 provided with a rudimentary membrane at their base or along their margin. Skin 

 pustulous or granular ; sometimes a large lumbar gland on each side. 



Obs. Pleurodema arunco {Biifo arunco, Schn.) ; P. bibroni, Tsch. (C 

 hibroni, Dum. and B.) ; P. bufoimum, Bell ; P. darwinii. Bell ; P. elegans, Bell, 

 and P. nodosa (C. nodosus, Dum and B.), constitute another generic group. 



Crinia, Tsch. Vomerine teeth either absent or else existing in a rudimentary 

 state. Tongue elongated, subelliptical, posteriorly entire, or very slightly 

 emarginate. Tympanum indistinct or hidden under the skin. Eustachian tubes 

 very small. Fingers and toes subcylindrical, tapering to a point and perfectly 

 free. 



Obs. This genus as characterized above, may not meet with the approba- 

 tion of Erpetologists, as combining species deprived of vomerine teeth and 

 others possessing but very few of them. Indeed, if we had more than one 

 species differing from the others in similar characters, we should not hesitate 

 to make two genera in the following manner : 



Crinia, Tsch. Vomerine teeth few, constituting two groups at the posterior 

 margin of the inner nostrils. Tongue entire, oblong. Tympanum not very dis- 

 tinct. Eustachian tubes quite small. Fingers and toes without membrane. 

 Crinia georgiana, Tsch."* 




1853.] 421 



Ranidella, Girard. Palate without teeth. Tongue elongated, subelliptica , 

 posteriorly slightly emarginated and free upon one-third of its length. Tynn- 

 panum not visible. Eustachian tubes minute. Fingers and toes subcylindrical, 

 tapering into a point and perfectly free. Ranidella signifera, Girard. 



With no specimen of Crinia georgiana at our command, we have been unable 

 to compare critically the characters of Crinias as just subdivided. For this 

 reason we do not raise Ranidella to the rank of a genus for the present. If fu- 

 ture investigations do not bring to light other species of each of these subdi- 

 visions, we shall not hesitate to consider Crinia georgiana and Ranidella sig- 

 nifera as congeneric species, in which the character of the vomerine teeth loses 

 that importance which it has elsewhere. 



Ranidella^ as circumscribed above, is related to Oxyglossus and Leiuperus in 

 the absence of teeth on the palate, differing from both, however, in having its 

 tympanum entirely hidden and its toes perfectly free. 



Crinia georgiana is an analogue, in Australia, of the South American Pleuro- 

 demas. 



WAGLERIA, Girard. Vomerine teeth disposed on a single and very long trans 

 verse row, situated behind the inner nostrils. Tympanum small and not very 

 distinct. Toes bordered by a membranous fold in the male. Tongue but slightly 

 notched posteriorly. 



Ohs. Wagleria peronu (C. peronii, D. and B.), and W. dorsalis (C dor- 

 salis, Gray, should the latter prove specifically distinct from the first), are the 

 two species which constitute this genus. Both species are natives of New Hol- 

 land, and of the first, specimens were collected by the Exploring Expedition 

 in the south-eastern part of Australia. The latter we only know through the 

 brief description of J. E. Gray. 



KASSINA, Girard. Vomerine teeth disposed in two V-shaped groups, situ- 

 ated behind the inner nostrils. Tympanum not distinct. Tongue cordiform, 

 emarginated behind. Fingers free, the first shorter than the second. Toes entirely 

 deprived of membrane. Skin perfectly smooth. 



Obs. Kassina senegalensis {Cystign, senegalensis, Dum. and B.) is the only 

 species hitherto known of this genus, the diagnosis of which may hereafter re- 

 quire some slight modifications, upon the reception of other species presenting 

 ^he same disposition of the vomerine teeth. 



Thus, the genera Leptodact7jluSi Cystignathns and Pleurodemi are American ; 

 the genera Wagleria, Crinia and ^arei6?e^^a are Australian, and the ^^qx^\x% Kassina 

 is African. 



From want of specimens, and accuracy in their descriptions, we have not been 

 able to determine, generically, Cystignathns aeneus, Guich., C schombnrghii, 

 Trosch., and C. sylvestris,T?,ch.., ?l\\ three from South America. The latter, 

 apparently, belongs to the genus Cystignathns proper, but seems to be provided 

 with a much smaller number of teeth, and likewise situated more anteriorly than 

 is usually the case in that group. The visibility of the tympanum and the pre- 

 sence of a partial membrane to the toes are strongly suggestive of that genus. 



Ranid-e. 



1. Leptodactyltjs serialis, G. Greenish brown on the head and back; yel" 

 lowish brown on the sides and legs, with series of black maculae. A post-orbital 

 vitta tapering into a point towards the shoulder. Margin of the jaws maculated 

 "with black and white. Vomerine teeth disposed upon angular arches. Tongue 

 cordiform, posteriorly free upon one third of its length, slightly emarginated at 

 both extremities. Toes with a rudimentary membrane at their base and along 

 their margin. Skin with indistinct longitudinal dorsal folds, otherw-ise smooth.

 maculae on the back, more conspicuous on the hind legs ; a large subcordiform 

 occipital macula. A post-ocular vitta extending a little behind the tympanum. 

 Vomerine teeth in regular curves. Tongue subelliptical, elongated, slightly 

 notched at both extremities. Toes provided with a rudimentary membrane at 

 their base and margined by a membranous fold. Skin smooth in the adult, traces 

 of longitudinal folds in the young.

 vomerine teeth. 



Locality. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 



3. Cystignathus parvulus, G. Yellowish brown above, with a deep chest- 

 nut narrow band extending from the tip of the snout to beyond the middle of the 

 length of the body. Beneath unicolor. Head subtriangular, wedge-shaped. An- 

 terior part of the snout depressed and regularly inclined towards the margin of 

 the upper jaw. Legs quite slender. 



Locality. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 



4. Cystignathus nebulosus, G. Above, light brown, white and clouded 

 "vrith reddish brown ; a large subtriangular, occipital, deep brown patch. A 

 post-ocular vitta of the same color. Hind legs barred with reddish brown. Be- 

 neath unicolor, whitish anteriorly, reddish posteriorly. Vomerine teeth in two 

 elongated groups, obliquely situated between the inner nostrils ; latter propor- 

 tionally large. Tympanum not visible exteriorly. Eustachian tubes very minute. 

 No lumbar glands. Fingers and toes depressed, latter margined wilh a mem- 

 branous fold, otherwise smooth. Two metatarsal tubercles. Tarsus with a 

 ridge along its inner margin. Skin minutely granular.

 which is another, still narrower, blackish brown band. Sides of abdomen and 

 belly marmorated. 



Locality. New Holland. 



Hyl^. 



Ranoidea, Tsch. Vomerine teeth disposed in two groups situated between the 

 inner nostrils. Tongue large, subcircular or elliptical, slightly notched poste- 

 riorly, and free for about one-third or less of its length. Tympanum distinct. 

 Eustachian tubes of considerable development. Fingers and toes depressed, 

 terminated by subelliptical disks, comparatively small. Fingers perfectly free ; 

 toes webbed to a considerable degree. A vocal subgular bladder in the male. 



Obs. The characters of this genus when compared to those oi Hijla, may appear 

 negative. The general physiognomy, which is more ranoid than hyloid, and 

 the smallnessof the subdigital disks, are the two most prominent features of this 

 group. The addition of two species partaking of the characters of the one, unique 

 when the genus was made, will add to the importance of retaining it in the erpe- 

 tological system. If habits go for any thing in the distinction of genera, 

 the fact that Kanoidea are more frequently seen about the waters than on the 

 trees, would certainly have a weight upon the question. 



6. Ranoidea resplendens, G. Deep green above, maculated and streaked 

 with gold. Head depressed, elongated. Tongue of medium size, notched and 

 free posteriorly. Vomerine teeth in two transversely elongated groups, situated

 behind the inner nostrils. Tympanum very distinct. Eustachian tubes of medium 

 size. Four fingers entirely free; toes united by a membrane to almost their 

 whole length ; subdigital disks of medium size. 



Obs. Hylarana has the priority over Lymnodytes, therefore it is here adopted.

 line on the middle of the back, flanked with black maculae ; legs transversely 

 barred with black. Rudimentary membrane of the base of the toes very distinct, 

 Subdigital disks large in both pairs of limbs. 



Locality. Sebuka, Fiji Islands.

By no means uncommon. The young of this and the preceding three species 

 of Rail are fully fledged by the 15th of August. 



GRUID.E, (10 species.) 



Grus Americana, Forster. 



A few white sandhill cranes are occasionally seen in the western part of ^the 

 State, near the Mississippi, but never approach the Lake shores, where the fol- 

 lowing species is common. It would appear that the white is a more southern 

 species than the brown. 



*GRrs Canadensis, Temm. 



Found on all our large prairies. Although we have seen large flights of these 

 birds, we never saw, or heard of, a white individual within one hundred miles 

 of Lake Michigan. A pair has nested regularly for fifteen years in a swamp 

 nine miles from Racine, (we have noticed them ourselves regularly for the last 

 seven years,) and they still continue in color unchanged. The locality of this 

 nest is in a few tussocks of grass, in the midst of an almost impenetrable swamp, 

 the nest is composed of coarse grass, built up in a conical form eighteen inches 

 or two feet high, so situated that when the parent bird sits upon, or rather astride 

 of this pyramidal nest, her feet hang down on either side into the water. The 

 old nest is regularly repaired every spring. 



Tantalus loculator, Livn. 



There is a fine specimen of this southern bird in the museum .of the Wisconsin 

 State Historical Society, at Madison, which was shot near Milwaukie, September, 

 1852.

Not uncommon in the wooded swamps of the timbered districts, never met 

 with in the prairie marshes. 



*BoTAL"RUS LENTIGINOSUS, SwainS. 



Abundant in the marshes and sleu\^ of the prairies. The young are fully 

 fledged by the 20th of July. We have witnessed the bittern emit his peculiar 

 call " pump-aii-gah ;" the head is drawn up to the'breast, the neck being much 

 dilated, when the first syllable /?;:> is uttered in a heavy low tone, the second 

 syllable aic is emitted with a partial extension of the neck, and the final gah is 

 accompanied with a violent darting forward of the head to the full extent of his 




426 [October, 



long neck. This ludicrous performance is repeated three or four times in 

 succession.

 nute worm, resembling in general form a tadpole, belonging to the genus 

 Cercaria. The species, after living for some time in the water, attach 

 themselves to fishes and other living animals, and after losing the tail, 

 form for themselves cysts in the integuments, and subsequently become 

 transformed into a parasitic worm of the genus Distoma.

 stone relics in good preservation, but the bones usually in fragments. The long 

 bones are sometimes perfect, but the crania are generally in a crumbling state.

434 [November. 



In 1847, I procured from a mound in the Wateree Swamp in Richland District 

 part of a cranium, which I forwarded to Dr. Morton, and of which he wrote me : 



" The skull is valuable in my series, as it is the only adult with the teeth that 

 I have ever possessed." 



During a heavy freshet in the Congaree River in August, 1852, several In- 

 dian cemetries on its banks were exposed, and many explorations were made 

 with a view to the collection of their remains. Numerous bones were found, 

 with many stone implements, but no crania, except the subject of this notice. 

 For it I am indebted to my friend Col. Frank Hampton, who found it on the wood- 

 lands Estate of his father a few miles below Columbia. A high, dry sandy 

 bluff was undermined by the current and fell, exposing an ancient burial place 

 in which bones and stone relics with earthen burial urns were abundant. This 

 single skull was found in good preservation, in a dry spot, and next rflay fortu- 

 nately the lower maxilla was discovered a few feet off. It belonged to an aged 

 man, and the hole in the right parietal bone indicates that it was caused by vio- 

 lence. A portion of the upper maxilla on each side is broken, as is the lower 

 part of the occipital bone, but the cranium is sufficiently perfect to present an ad- 

 mirable specimen of the aboriginal American, of the Toltecan variety of Dr. 

 Morton. In its dimensions, in some of them, it is larger than the fine cranium 

 (1512, Morton's Catalogue,) from Ohio. The elevation is about the same, but 

 the longitudinal and interparietal diameters, the intermastoid line, and the inter- 

 mastoid arch are greater. The frontal bone is more flattened, and the occiput 

 equally so the facial bones are well developed, and an important value is given 

 to the specimen by the ponderous lower jaw, which is wanting in that from Ohio. 

 A number of stone specimens were found at the same time mostly such as are 

 figured in the work of Squier and Davis, pp. 217 18 and 237. Several of these 

 are forwarded with the cranium as well as some long bones. 



1 take great pleasure in adding this skull to the Morton Collection of the Aca- 

 demy, and to congratulate our members on the possession of that noble monument 

 of its late lamented President his life-labor of love. It is a fortunate privilege 

 that I have in being able to make a contribution to it, in memory of one whose 

 loss has been so deeply felt by the scientific world."

On the influence of some states of Respiration upon the Pulse. 

 By S. Weir Mitchell, M. D. 



I desire to offer to the Academj'' an abstract of a paper upon the influence of 

 some states of respiration on the pulse. As the original paper will shortly ap- 

 pear at length in the American Journal of Medical Science, I shall be as brief as 

 possible. 



Laborious respiration may be studied under four heads. 



1. The movement of inspiration, thorax in motion. 



2. Complete and full inspiration, thorax at rest. 



3. The movement of expiration, thorax moving. 



4. Complete expiration, thorax at rest. 



The dynamical relations of the blood to the heart and lungs will vary in each 

 of these cases. 



During inspiratory movement the lung is expanded, and, while air passes into 

 its cells, the blood of the greater vessels and of the two hearts tends to enter its 

 sponge-like tissue, under the influence of atmospheric pressure. A reverse pro- 

 cess occurs in expiration, and some blood, as well as most of the air is driven out 

 of the lung. 




436 [November, 



During prolonged inspiration, therefore, the left heart receives but little blood. 

 In the state of expiration, on the contrary, it receives a larger share. But the 

 heart's niovements are to some extent regulated by the annoutit of blood which 

 enters its cavities, and hence we have in inspiratory movements a slow pulse, and 

 in expiratory action a quick pulse. Such are, to a certain extent, the explanations 

 of Dr. J. Reid, who noticed the phenomena in question, during his vivisections. 

 I have found no occasion to contradict his conclusions, and my own explanations 

 go to prove what that great physiologist merely inferred. I have also made cer- 

 tain novel applications of this knowledge, such as will be found in my paper, de- 

 tailed at some length. 



I have observed the above mentioned phenomena on animals, and even in the 

 unusually prolonged respiratory movements of a few human subjects. 



During fixed inspiration the pulse lowers, in a large proportion of men. In 

 fixed expiration, on the contrary, the pulse rises. Thus, an average of 40 cases 

 gave the following results : 



Normal pulse SO, inspiratory pulse 70, difference 10 ; expiratory pulse 93 ; ex- 

 cess over normal pulse, 13 beats ; extreme of numeral difference between the in- 

 duced pulses, 23. 



Of the 40 pulses thus recorded, during fixed inspiration, 6 fell, over 20 beats, 

 8 fell, over 12 and 18, 5 or over 5 beats, per minute. 



Soma of the most extreme rases are yet more remarkable. Thus pulses of 

 108, 9G and 92, fell respectively, 49, 28 and 26, per minute. The largest rise in 

 fixed expiration was 36 pulsations per minute; the normal pulse being 83. In a 

 case of hypertrophy of the heart, with a pulse of 80, it fell so much in fixed in- 

 spiration and rose so much in a like expiratory condition, as to make a total dif- 

 ference of fifty pulsations between the two states. 



For more minute information, I refer to the paper above mentioned. 



I offer the following explanation of the facts thus recorded. 



It is possible that nerve power may in some way assist in producing the re- 

 sults : of this, I have no direct evidence. In asphyxia, the heart beats rapidly at 

 first, becomip.ii: slow, as the circulation is checked in (he capillaries of the lungs. 

 In this stage of asphyxia, the right heart is congested and the left heart has too 

 little blood. That slow pulsation of the heart w^hich then ensues has usually 

 been ascribed by physiologists, in part at least, to this double irregularity in the 

 distribution of the blood. 



During profound and retained inspiration, we dilate the air cells at the expense 

 of the neighboring capillaries. As a consequence their circulation is somewhat 

 impeded, blood accumulates in the right heart, is deficient in the left heart, and 

 the whole organ beats slowly. Dilation of the pulmonary vesicles may be pro- 

 duced by direct distension, as when we blow into the trachea, or by forces acting 

 from without, as occurs during life, in the thoracic movements. In the first case, 

 we have the additional element of pressure, which, however, does not very ma- 

 terially alter the conditions, as I have shown elsewhere. The following experi- 

 ments illustrate the propositions above stated. 



Owing to difficulties almost insurmountable, the dilatation of the air cells was 

 made by insufflation, and not by expansible forces acting from without. A tube 

 was placed in the trachea of a pair of dead lungs taken from a sheep, a glass tube 

 i inch in diameter and three feet long, was tied in the mouth of the pulmonary 

 artery. A similar tube was in like manner adjusted to the left auricle, so as to 

 receiv<i all fluids coming from the lungs. A column of fluid was placed in the 

 tube of the pulmonary artery. It ran into the lungs, and at last rose slowly in 

 the tube which I had tied in the mouth of the left auricle. The lung was now 

 filled with air by gently inflating through the tracheal tube. As the lung ex- 

 panded, the fluid usually fell a little in both tubes, and most in that of the pulmo- 

 nary artery. The water still passed through the vessels until a state of extreme 

 tension was attained, when the tide was checked. To do this completely, re- 

 quired a fuller inflation than could occur in health. In fact, I have sometimes 

 been able to force both columns of liquid in a reverse direction, 2 or 3 inches up 

 the tubes. As the lung was allowed to contract in expiration, the fluid ran 

 through the vessels with a facility which seemed greatest during complete ex- 

 piration. When the bloody fluid stood at a level in both tubes, inspiratory 



^"1 




1853.] 437 



movement lowered it in both tubes. Expiratory movement caused it to rise in 

 both. 



During numerous vivisections, I noted the following corroborative facts : 



The lung grows pallid in extreme inspiration, it flushes to a deep red in expi- 

 ration. That this change of color is not due to a mere aggregation of the capil- 

 laries, is clear from the following fact. During complete inspiration the lung 

 was scratched so as to open some capillary vessels. No bleeding occurred until 

 the lung was allowed to contract, when the wound began to ooze. The flow of 

 blood was greatest in complete expiration. Care must be taken not to wound 

 any large vessel. The illustrative bearing of these facts upon my preceding re- 

 marks is too plain for further comment. 



At the moment of complete inspiration; the capillary circulation is retarded 

 or checked. As a consequence there is an accumulation of blood in the pulmo- 

 nary artery and right heart, and a deficiency of blood in the pulmonary vein and 

 left heart. 



Owing to this double disturbance, the heart beats slowly. The same set of 

 causes, produced in another way, lessen the heart beats in one of the stages of 

 asphyxia. This view is also supported in other ways, and by certain facts too 

 numerous for mention here. 



In expiratory fixation the heart quickens as I have very amply proved. 



This is due to several causes : 



l.In expiration, however complete, the lung still containsenough of air to keep 

 its vesicles moderately open. Therefore the blood traverses its tissue with ease, 

 until asphyxia ensues. 



2. The muscular exertion requisite for a complete expiration is one-third 

 greater than that which a full inspiration demands, and as we well know mus- 

 cular exertion quickens the pulse. 



3. Owing to this excess of expiratory force, and to the firm pressure ex- 

 erted by the condensed lungs upon the heart, that organ is mechanically stimu- 

 lated. If the heart of an animal be grasped during life it will flutter under the 

 hand with a quick beat, and as if shuddering beneath the compressing agency. 

 If the lung itself is firmly and equally pressed against the heart the same result 

 occurs. 



To the combined influence of the three causes above enumerated, I ascribe the 

 rapid pulse of fixed expiration. I have therefore shown that in the movements 

 of respiration, as well as in states of extreme inspiratory and expiratory fixation, 

 the pulmonary circulation is subjected to singular and interesting modifications. 

 I shall close my remarks with a single application. 



During inspiration the lungs contain a maximum amount of blood which is to 

 some degree retarded in the capillaries at the moment of inspiratory fulness. It 

 is precisely at this moment that the lungs contain most oxygen. On the other 

 hand, during expiration, and during expiratory fixation, the aerated blood, leaves 

 the lung with the utmost facility. A regulation so beautiful as this should not 

 be allowed to escape attention. For other and equally curious deductions I re- 

 fer to the essay itself.

 Museum, an opportunity of which was now offered him. Referred to 

 the Curators. 



Dr. Le Conte presented a paper intended for publication in the Pro- 

 ceedings, entitled " Descriptions of new Coleoptera, from Texas, chiefly 

 collected by the U. S. Boundary Expedition.'' Pteferred to Dr. Leid}-, 

 Dr. Hays and Dr. Hallowell. 



Dr. Leidy presented a paper for publication in the Journal, entitled 

 " On Bathygnathus borealis, an extinct Saurian from the new Red 

 Sandstone of Prince Edward's Island." Referred to Mr. Lea, Dr. 

 Ruschenberger and Dr. Coates. 



On leave granted, Mr. Foulke offered a Resolution, instructing the 

 Curators to enquire into the expediency of keeping the Museum open 

 on more than two days in the week, and of granting the privilege of 

 giving tickets of admission to subscribers to a fund for meeting the ex- 

 penses of so doing.

 Mr. Ord, President, in the Chair. 



A letter was read from the Hon. J. K. Kane, dated Philada., Dec. 

 11, 1853, transmitting a copy of Dr. Kane's new work on the Grrinnell 

 Arctic Expedition. 



Mr. Lea called the attention of the members to the specimen of Gneiss 

 bored by Pholas dactylus, and containing the shell. The specimen is 

 from the coast of France, and was procured by M. Cuyot, who had first 

 noticed the fact of Gneiss Rock being bored by this animal. The spe- 

 cimen proves that the boring action must have been of a mechanical 

 character and not chemical, as had been supposed by Deshayes. M. 

 Cu3'-ot was satisfied that it resulted from the animal twisting itself 

 around in the rock.

 The President, Mr. Ord, in the Chair. 



Mr. Conrad presented a paper for publication in the Journal, entitled 

 *' Monograph of the genus Argonauta, with descriptions of five new spe- 

 cies," which waa referred to Mr. Phillips, Dr. Leidy, and Dr. Le Conte. 



Mr. Conrad also presented two other papers for publication in the 

 Proceedings, entitled ''Synopsis of the genus Cassidula, and description 

 of a proposed new genus, Athlcta," and " Omissions and corrections to 

 a Synopsis of the North American Naiades," both of which were re- 

 ferred to the Committee on the first paper.

A note was read from Mrs. C. M. G-ambel, accompanying the Journal 

 of her late husband. Dr. Wm. Gambel, of an overland expedition to 

 California in 1849, and giving permission to the Academy to examine 

 and make selections from the manuscript. Referred to the Curators. 



Decemher 27th. 

 Vice-President Bridges in the Chair. 



The Committee on Dr. Le Conte's " Descriptions of new Coleoptera 

 from Texas, chiefly collected by the U. S. Boundary Commission," re- 

 ported in favor of publication in the Proceedings. 



Descrijptions of some new Coleoptera from Texas, chiefly collected by the Mexican 



Boundary Commission. 



Most of the new species described in the following pages, were collected 

 by Mr. Arthur Schott, of the Mexican Boundary Commission under Major 

 Emory ; they were procured in the vicinity of Eagle Pass, on the lower portion of 

 the Rio Grande. With them were several other species, belonging to genera of less 

 interest, and which are here omitted, because numerous species from other parts 

 lOf the country yet remain to be described. Those herein contained belong to 

 groups which are particularly interesting, or which have been made the subject 

 of special essays. In the genus Ophryastes, I have added descriptions of several 

 contained in my collection from Missouri and California, and added new descrip- 

 tions of the two species already described by Say and Schonherr, so that the 

 student who may have occasion to refer to the genus, may find in a small space, 

 the distinctive characters ot all the species yet known within our territory. 



To indicate the importance of accurate collections in distant parts of the 

 country, I may add that, while the collection contained about 110 species of 

 Coleoptera, 40 were new to our fauna. A much greater portion w^ould have 

 been added, had not the very active researches of Lieut. H. Haldeman already 

 discovered a large number of those not included in the forty above mentioned. 



Besides the species below described, I have added in the Revision of the Ela- 

 teridae of the United States, just published in the 10th volume of the Transac- 

 tions of the American Philosophical Society, desciiptions of two very large spe- 

 cies of Agryppus, a genus not before fully enrolled in our fauna. 



CiciNDELA Linn. ^ 



Among the species belonging to our fauna must be placed C. curvata 

 Chevr., and C. decostigma Chevr. (Col. Mex. fasc. 2d,) Mexican species 

 which have been found in Texas. The former was collected by the Commission, 

 the latter by Lieut. Haldeman. 



C. vulturina, supra sericeo-nigra, capite thoraceque virescentibus, labro 

 albo, medio producto, 3-dentato, thorace paulo convexo, postice angustiore, late- 

 ribus late rotundatis breviter albo-pilosis, antice posticeque profundissime im- 

 presso, tenuiter canaliculato, elytris thorace sesqui latioribus minus convexis, 

 apice late rotundatis non serratis, margine tenui cyanescente, versus basin vage 

 punctatis ; subtus purpureo-cyanea; fronte plana, utrinque subtiliter rugosa, 

 glabra. Long. 63-*74. 



Eagle Pass. The first joint of the labial palpi of the male is testaceous. This 

 species seems to be most commonly without white marks on the elytra ; the 

 color in one specimen is greenish black, in the others it is pure black, at least 

 on the elytra. One specimen has a faint rudiment of an apical lunule ; in an- 




440 [December, 



other the lunule is narrow and divided, and the humerus has a distinct round 

 white spot ; in a third there is no humeral spot, but there is a narrow transverse 

 line about the middle, and one-third way from the margin to the suture ; a small 

 spot below and inside of this is obsoletely connected with it ; the line joining 

 these spots, and which represents the medial band of the elytra, makes an angle 

 of about 45 with the suture. This species is very closely allied to C. obsoleta 

 Say, and differs from it principally by the thorax being more convex and dis- 

 tinctly rounded on the sides. 



TosTEGOPTERA Blanch. 



1. T. ventricosa, atra convexa (glabra?) thorace lateribus rotundatis 

 serratis medio subangulatis confertim grosse punctato, callo pone medium dor- 

 sali lasvi, disco antice rix obsolete impresso, elytris subsulcatis, confluenter 

 minus profunde punctatis, punctis granulo elevate munitis, costis fere laevibus. 

 Long. '9, lat. '57. 



Two females. This species is very different from S. cribosa Lee. (Proc. Acad. 

 Nat. Sc. 6,23), by thepuncturesof the thorax being smaller and more regular, and 

 by the absence of the distinct flattened surface before the middle; the elytra are 

 also more distinctly sulcate. I am inclined to believe that these species are in 

 reality furnished with hairs or scales when living, and that the little granule ob- 

 served in each of the large punctures of the elytra is the attachment of such 

 scales. The fine scattered punctures of the under surface are furnished with 

 short hairs, but those of the upper surface are entirely glabrous. 



2. T. aequalis, atra, convexa, thorace lateribus rotundatis vix serratis* 

 medio subangulatis, sat dense minus grosse punctato, pilis albidis consperso 

 elytris aequaliter sat grosse punctatis, lineis duabus sub-laevibus vix distinctis> 

 sutura elevata punctis paucis notata. Long. -S, lat. '45. 



One female. Easily distinguished by the absence of any distinct grooves and 

 the smaller punctures of the elytra. The punctures of the thorax still retain 

 some elongated flattened white hairs, which may originally have been dense ; 

 the punctures of the elytra furnish excessively short, almost invisible white 

 hairs. 



I have adopted this genus, because it has been recently proposed, and because 

 I have had no leisure yet to examine critically the group to which it belongs ; 

 still, after a comparison between the different species, and some of our common 

 species of Phyllophaga Harris, (Ancylonycha Blanch.) 1 have failed to discover 

 any reason why they should be separated. 



A new species from Texas completes the connection, by possessing with the 

 thick convex body of Tostegoptera, the exact sculpture of Phyllophaga quercina. 



Erirhipis Burm.

 gosis et punctatis. Long. '39 '54. 



Euphoria cer^zi* Haldeman,Stansbury's Exped.toSalt Late. 374, tab. 9, fig 10. 



Large numbers of this species have been collected by Lieut. Haldeman in 

 Texas, and by the Boundary Commission at Eagle Pass ; the original specimen 

 was obtained by the late Mr. R. Kern near Santa Fe. 



The male has the club of the antennae as long as the remaining portion, and 

 the anterior tibiae armed with two moderate teeth, the third or upper tooth being 

 hardly visible. 



In the female the club of the antennae is shorter than the rest ; the anterior 

 tibiae are armed with three teeth, of which the two inferior are longer than in 

 the male. 



In most specimens the elytra are yellow, with the suture, and some spots es- 

 pecially near the suture, black ; the black spots gradually enlarge until the elytra 




1853.] 441 



become entirely black; at the same time the yellow at the sides and base of the 

 thorax becomes reduced and gradually disappears. 



2. E. C la rki i, rufa, nitida, subtus Jonge pallide pilosa, clypeo nijjro tenu- 

 iter marginato, antice subemarginato, thorace latitudine breviore, lateribus

 sutura maculisque pluribus nigris, scutello, pectore, genubus tarsisque nigris, illo 

 gutta rufa ornato. Long. -42 5. 



Several females collected by Messrs. Clark and Schott. This species seems 

 very closely related to the preceding, but the pale color on the thorax extends 

 also along the middle, and the abdomen and feet are rufous; the antennae and 

 anterior tibiae are precisely as in E. Kernii. 



3. E. S c h o 1 1 i i , nigra, subtus nitida, longe pallide pilosa, supra opaca, cly-

 elytris striolis obscure luteis transversis plus minusve variegatis, sutura costis- 

 que duabus elevatis, interstitiis bistriatis vage punctatis. Long. -45 '55. 



Several specimens collected at Eagle Pass by Mr. Schott, to whom I take 

 great pleasure in dedicating this species. The club of the antennae in the male 

 is very long, and the anterior tibiae have two short teeth at the apex; in the 

 female the club of the antennae is shorter than the remainder, and the anterior 

 tibiae are tridentate; the inferior tooth is not, however, elongated as in the two pre- 

 ceding species. It belongs to the same division of the genus as E. inda, but 

 the hair on the thorax is not long as in that species. The yellow markings of 

 the elytra are sometimes very abundant and confluent, at other times they are 

 hardly visible ; besides the little yellowish red line of the middle of the thorax 

 at the base, a vitta each side of the middle abbreviated at each end can some- 

 times be seen; the angle each side of the medial emargination is very distinct, 

 while in the two species above described the emargination hardly exists, and 

 the base is almost uniformly broadly rounded. 



The beautiful Dendrobias 4-maculatus J>?^^;o7i^(Mag. Zool. 1836,) and Tylosis 

 oculatus Lee. (Journ. Acad. Nat. Sc, 2d ser.2, 9) have been added to our fauna. 

 Both have been previously known from Mexico. A remarkable variety of Tra- 

 gidion coquus was also found, in which the yellow spots of the elytra are very 

 small and hardly visible. 



Stenaspis Dup. 



With this genus must be united Smileceras Lee, founded upon Cerambyx 

 solitarius Say. The female of this rare species was procured by the Expedition, 

 and differs from the male in having the antennae two-thirds the length of the 

 body. The 11th joint is not longer than the 10th, and is distinctly transversely 

 impressed; the joints from the fourth, outwards, have the external edge com- 

 pressed; the third also has a compressed edge beyond the middle.

Texas, and from Dr. Berlandiere's collection. This species must evidently be 

 referred to the present genus, although the prosternum is much less prominent 

 between the coxae than in the other species, and the lateral tubercle of the 

 thorax is not very distinct. The anterior lateral tubercle observed in S. solitaria 

 is entirely wanting, the sides being almost regularly rounded; the posterior con- 

 striction is very deep, and the base is more sinuate than in the other species. 

 The head is precisely as in the preceding. The antennae are black, with the 

 joints growing brownish red from the fourth, outwards ; the articulations are 




442 [December, 



black. The tibiae are black, pubescent with yellow hair. The very deep and 

 angular confluent rugosities of the elytra and their shining golden green color 

 will readily distinguish this species. 



Mannophorus. 



Mesosternum simplex, baud protuberans; mandibul^ subacutae ; palpi breves, 

 subaequales, articulo ultimo subcylindrico longiore ; thorax rotundatus, non ar- 

 matus ad apicem transversim constrictus et margine prominulo munitus, basi 

 marginatus; elytra costa eburnea ornata, mutica ; pedes tenues, femora mutica 

 non clavata, tarsi postici articulo Imo paulo elongato ; antennae 11-articulatae 

 tenues elongatae, maris articulo ultimo fere diviso. 



This genus belongs to the Elaphidion group, but is sufficiently distinct from 

 all the others of that group found in our territory. It will probably fall eventu- 

 ally into some of those invented by Mr. Serville, but from the very artificial 

 nature of the arrangement made by him, it is impossible to determine where it 

 may be found. 



It diifers from Elaphidion by the less dilated palpi, as well as by the 11th 

 joint of the antennae of the male being somewhat divided as in Eburia and Pur- 

 puricenus, approaching most nearly to the latter, but differing from both by the 

 more cylindrical palpi and by the very curious acute collar which surrounds the 

 apex of the thorax, and which projects very conspicuously at the sides. In the 

 form of body it resembles closely Crossidius testaceus Lee, and I was at first 

 inclined to lefer it to that genus. The mandibles, however, are not at all bifid^ 

 and the body, though slightly pubescent, is much less hairy than in Crossidius.

 gustis flavis, (quarum interior laevigata et elevata,) postice abbreviatis, apice 

 subtruncata. Long. '5 .6. 



Several specimens. The antenna of the male are longer, those of the female 

 shorter than the body. The thorax has a faint rudiment of a dorsal line near 

 the base. The inner vitta of the elytra is one fourth from the suture, the outer 

 one is near the margin ; they are both abbreviated about one seventh from the 

 tip. Varieties occur with the vittae shorter, and with a black dorsal spot on 

 the thorax near the base.

Specimens procured by the expedition at Eagle Pass, and by Dr. Bcrlandiere 

 in Northern Mexico. Related to E. pubescens, but the punctures of the elytra 

 are larger, the color is darker, and the pubescence shorter and more sparse. 

 The thorax of the female is coarsely, that of the male finely punctured.

One specimen. In form and size is very similar to E. neglectum, but the 

 thorax has no callosities, and the elytra are slightly truncate and entirely un- 

 armed at the apex. The affinities of this species seem to be with E. rauticum 

 Newm., but it is much smaller.

Texas and Northern Mexico. Lieut. Haldeman and Dr. Berlandiere. This 

 species resembles in appearance E. villosum, but the glabrous line of the thorax 

 and the absence of the long apical spines of the elytra will at once distinguish it; 

 the spots of yellowish hair on the thorax are inclined to form four vittae. 



The scutellum in the species here described is densely pubescent, but as this 

 seems to be a character in all the species of the genus, I have not mentioned it 

 in the individual descriptions.

One specimen, Nebraska. This species most resembles O. sulcirostris, but 

 the obliquity of the lateral grooves of the rostrum and the difference of the color 

 will distinguish it. The thorax is more deeply channelled, and is less constricted 

 posteriorly.

One specimen found on the Arkansas River, near the mountains. The thorax 

 is gradually dilated from the anterior constriction to the widest portion, while 

 in O. latirostris it is suddenly dilated behind the anterior constriction, and then 

 sinuate, so as to form two lateral prominences, of which the posterior one is 

 larger and less rounded.

One specimen, Santa Fe, New Mexico, collected by Mr. Fendler. This spe- 

 cies differs from the three preceding, by the rostrum not being transversely im- 

 pressed at the base, and from the next by the lateral grooves of the rostrum 

 extending between the e);es, by the middle groove being less deep, and by the 

 lateral dilatations of the thorax being much more prominent, as well as by the 

 difference in the arrangement of the dark vittae of the elytra, and the deeper 

 punctures of the striae. The scales of the thorax have been removed, in great 

 part, so that I do not know if the color was variegated on that part of the body.

Platte and Arkansas Rivers ; not rare ; found also by the Commission at Eagle 

 Pass. The elytra of the male are but little wider than the thorax, those of the 

 female are more rounded, a little flattened on the back, and about one half wider 

 than the thorax ; the dark vittae of the thorax and elytra appear to be produced, 

 in part, by abrasion, as specimens occur in which they are hardly to be seen. 

 The suture, as far as the first stria, is covered with brown scales, having a slight 

 coppery reflexion.

Eagle Pass, several specimens. This fine species is certainly the most beau- 

 tiful of this family yet found in the United States : the lateral grooves of the 

 rostrum are situated in the side and converge a little posteriorly ; the inter- 

 mediate grooves occupy the position of the lateral grooves in the species of 

 division (A.) and are very short, not by any means obvious ; the vittae of the 

 thorax are made up of spots placed close together and separated by narrow lines; 

 two or three small spots are scattered between the dorsal vitta and the lateral 

 one ; the anterior and posterior constriction, with their rows of punctures areas 

 in the species of the first division, but are hardly apparent in the lateral outline 

 of the thorax, which is regularly curved, only a little indented at base and apex ; 

 the elytra of the male are about one-fourth, those of the female about one-third 

 wider than the thorax ; the snowy white vittae are a little irregular in their out- 

 line, the elytra beyond the 7th stria are covered with grayish white scales, simi- 

 lar to those of the under surface, and contrasting with the snowy whiteness of 

 the vittae ; the legs are speckled with dark fuscous, but the usual femoral band 

 is not seen.

One female, with the elytra nearly twice as wide as the thorax, found at Val- 

 lecitas, California ; the anterior and posterior marginal impressions of the tho- 

 rax are entire and very distinct, uniting with the dorsal line ; the color is more 

 uniform than in the other species, nevertheless the elytra are slightly mottled ; 

 an occipital line, the sides of the rostrum, and a space behind the eyes are covered 

 with fuscous metallic scales ; the dark band of the femora existing in many of 

 the species is more conspicuous in this, on account of the denser white scales of 



the legs.

Desert of the Colorado, California ; chiefly on Larrea Mexicana. The elytra 

 of the male are not wider, those of the female are twice as wide as the thorax. 




1853.] 445 



This species is remarkably different from all those ahove described by the medial 

 groove of the rostrum being obsolete, except towards the tip, where it appears 

 as an oblong fovea ; the lateral grooves are not deep, and end at the transverse 

 impression at the base of the rostrum. Over the body and legs the white scales 

 are intermixed with pale fuscous, giving a dullness to the color ; the fuscous 

 stripes of the elytra are very variable, sometimes they are well defined ; in other 

 specimens they are confused by fuscous spots on the adjoining interstitial spaces ; 

 the dark fascia of the femora is moderately distinct.

One male found by the Commission at Eagle Pass. The scales are unfortunately 

 removed in great part, but the elytra at the apex show some appearance of having 

 been variegated with darker marks. Beneath, the body is uniformly and densely 

 covered with grayish scales. The sides of the thorax are nearly straight at the 

 middle, narrowed and rounded slightly at each end ; tne transverse marginal im- 

 pressions are visible only in the sides. The rostrum is more flattened above 

 than in any other species, and the middle groove is very indistinct, and so di- 

 lated anteriorly that the surface becomes broadly concave ; the lateral grooves 

 are very short and not deep. The appearance is very similar to Epicaerus, but 

 the ciliate thoracic postocular lobes require it to be placed in this genus. 

 tr- Although but two new species of this interesting genus were procured by the 

 Boundary Commission, I have thought that a short account of all the species 

 known to me, would be useful. 



Pelecyphortjs Sol. 



P. e 1 a t us, niger, capite profunde impresso, thorace latitudine paulo bre^io^e, 

 lateribus antice latissime reflexis medio angulatis, angulis anticis et posticis dis- 

 tinctis, elytris oblongo-ovalibus, postice acutiusculis, convexis, thorace plus 

 duplo latioribus punctis rugosis minus profundis impressis, lineis tribus sutura- 

 que lasvibus, epipleuris subito inflexis, humeris minutis porrectis. Long. 1'3. 



A large species, remarkable for the form of the thorax, which is tolerably re- 

 gularly hexagonal, with all the angles well defined ; the sides are very strongly 

 reflexed anteriorly, but become gradually narrower from the lateral angle to the 

 base. This species agrees with P. confluens Lee. and the next species, as well 

 as v^'ith all the others referred by me to the genus,except Asida anastomosis, in hav- 

 ing elongate palpi with the last joint strongly securiform, and a large lateral open- 

 ing between the mentum and the base of the mandibles. The species referred 

 by me to Euschides (Stenomorpha Solier,') have the same form of mouth, but ap- 

 pear to have the last joint of the palpi broader and more regularly triangular. I 

 am doubtful about the generic value of that character, but at present all is con- 

 fusion in regard to genera of Tenebrionidae ; the presternum is longitudinally 

 deeply concave between the anterior coxae, and is not produced posteriorly ; the 

 sides of the elytra are not margined, although the epipleuras are suddenly inflexed. 



P. s o r d i d u s, piceo-niger, capite modice impresso, punctato, thorace latitu-

Arkansas River, near the mountains. The female has the elytra twice as wide 

 as the thorax, and more rounded on the sides than in the other sex. The antepectus 

 is sulcate between the coxae, but the groove is narrower than in the preceding 

 species. The specimens are covered with an earthy matter, which adheres very 

 strongly. 



Another species was found by the Commission, of which only the elytra are 

 preserved ; they are obovate, dilated gradually for three-fourths of their length 

 somewhat flattened anteriorly, very declivous, and subacute posteriorly, trun- 

 cate at base with a well defined margin ; lateral margin acute, extending within 

 one-fifth of the apex ; the disc is sparsely punctured, and each elytron is marked 

 with three faint elevated ridges obsolete at both ends, and of which the exter- 

 nal one is the most distinct. The sculpture of the under surface and the pro- 

 portions of the legs are exactly those of P. s o r d i d u s, which it will probably 

 resemble in the form of the thorax. As the characters drawn from the form and 

 sculpture of the elytra are very distinct in this genus, I venture to name this 

 species P. subcostatus. 



MiCROSCHATIA Sol. 



M. contorta, sordide fusca, longiuscula, capite profunde excavato, thorace 

 hexagonal!, latitudine vix breviore, angulis lateralibus apice rotundatis, lateri- 

 bus postice paulo emarginatis, disco canaliculato, inaequali, elytris postice dila- 

 tatis, lateribus serrato-tuberculatis, costa discoidali alte tuberculata irregu- 

 lariter fracta, cum sutura elevata lineis transversis. connexa ornatis. Long. '37. 



From the collection of the late Dr. Berlandiere ; this very ugly insect 

 bears a certain analogy to Asida anastomosis Say, in appearance, but is 

 very distinct by the hexagonal thorax, and more rough elytra ; the discoidal 

 costa ends about one-fourth from the apex in a high tubercle ; the marginal series 

 of tubercles ends by bending inwards to the suture about one-sixth from the apex. 



The maxillary palpi are small, and can be almost entirely concealed behind 

 the mentum, which not only fills up the progenial cavity, but abuts against the 

 mandibles, entirely covering the mouth beneath ; this is also the case in Asida 

 anastomosis, and in the two species of Microschatia described by me (Ann. Lye. 

 5, 129,) which are properly congeneric with that species ; it remains still to be 

 determined whether they should enter Solier's genus, of which only one species 

 was known to the inventor. 



The present species differs from all the others mentioned in having the third joint 

 of the antennae not longer than the fourth ; the prosternum is broadly produced 

 posteriorly, as in M. inrequalis. 



Asida anastomosis, incorrectly referred by me to Pelecyphorus, has the pros- 

 ternum regularly rounded and not produced posteriorly. 



Trioropiius Lee. 



T. n o d i c e p s, ater, minus nitidus, capite subtilius postice densius punctato, 

 lateribus margine tenui reflexo, fronte tuberculo magno obtuso ornata, thorace

 tatis. Long. 'SS. 



One specimen : Eagle Pass. Differs from the three species described by me 

 (Ann. Lye. 5, 141) in the less punctured head, the much larger frontal tubercle and 

 by the wider and more inflated elytra. 



Embaphion Say. 



1. E. concavum, elongato-ellipticum, nigrum, thoracis et elytrorum late-

 pidis. Long. '78, lat. '4. 




1853.] 447 



One specimen. Resembles E. muricatum Say, but is longer and narrower, 

 with the broad margin of the elytra more suddenly reflexed and almost perpen- 

 dicular. Although so different in form, this genus is only distinguished from 

 Eleodes by the inferior plane of the mentum being more rounded and more deeply 

 impressed ; its anterior margin is slightly incised ; the lateral angles are so much 

 inflexed as to be invisible ; the tarsi are sulcate beneath, and fringed at the 

 apex and sides with short spines ; the middle joints of the posterior tarsi appear 

 more elongated than in Eleodes. I have great doubt of the generic value of any 

 of these differences, and several nondescript species from New Mexico seem to 

 be intermediate, both by the form of the body and by the differences in the 

 mentum. 



Lytta Linn. 



1. L. fulvipennis Lee, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sc. 6, 33, though smaller, does not

 thorace fere duplo latioribus. Long. '11, 



One specimen. This species having the joints of the antennae oval, and the 

 labrum slightly emarginate, and the outer spur of the posterior tibiae obtuse, 

 belongs to division A c of my essay on this genus, (Proc. Acad. 6, 331 ;) the 

 outer joints of the antennae are hardly thicker than those near the base ; they 

 extend to about the anterior third of the elytra. L. reticulata Say (Journ. Acad. 

 Nat. Sc. 3, 305) must resemble this species, but is said to be entirely black, 

 tinged slightly with green. The antennae are said to be thickened towards the 

 tip, and the punctures of the thorax confluent posteriorly. 



3. L. morio, aira immaculata, confertim subtiliter punctata, brevissime 

 pubescens, thorace latitudine paulo breviore, subcanaliculato, angulis anticis ro-

 Long. "4 53. 



This species resembles L. pensylvanica, but is larger and more robust, and 

 the thorax is wider; in form it precisely resembles L. fissilabris Lee, but the 

 labrum is very slightly emarginate, and the spurs of the posterior tibiae are not 

 equal. The head, as in L. pensylvanica, has a fine glabrous, longitudinal line. 



4. L. sublineata, elongata, nigra subtiliter dense punctulata, dense luteo- 

 griseo pubescens, thorace capite sesqui angustiore, latitudine paulo longiore, 

 lateribus parallelis antice rotundatis, disco late canaliculato, macula utrinque

 tenuissimis denudatis atris, tarsis palpis antennisque nigris, his articulo 2ndo 3io 

 paulo breviore. Long. 1-05. 



One female, with the first joint of the antennae extending to the posterior mar- 

 gin of the eyes. This fine species resembles L. immaculata and longicollis, but 

 the thorax is less convex, and the unequal distribution of the pubescence will 

 distinguish it. The posterior tibiae appear black, but I do not think that this 

 will be found to be a constant character. 



5. L. fulvescens, nigra elongata dense subtiliter pubescens, densissime 

 luteo-fulvo-pnbescens, thorace capite paulo angustiore, latitudine longiore, late- 

 ribus parallelis antice rotundatis, canaliculato, elytris thorace paulo latioribus 

 immaculatis, antennis tarsisque nigris, illis articulo 2do 3io fere a;quali, palpis 

 testaceis, apice nigris. Long. '59 68. 



Several specimens ; found also by Lieut. H. Haldeman in Texas. Resembles 

 L. longicollis, but is smaller and without any denuded humeral spot. By the 

 color of the palpi it also differs from all the allied species. The first joint of the 

 antennae extends a little beyond the posterior margin of the eyes in the male; in 

 the female it is a little shorter. 



L. ferruginea Say^ L. conspersa Lee- and L. immaculata Say, besides L. my-

Synopsis of the Genera Cassidula, Humph., and of a proposed new gentis Athleta. 



By T. A. Conrad. 



Cassidula, Hiimph,, Melongena, Schum. 



The genus Cassidula was founded by Humphreys on Buccinum calcaratum. 

 (Solander,) who included Miirex rnelongena, Lin. and a Florida shell which he 

 terms M. cornuta, and cites Buccinum trames, Solander. This may be Murex 

 corona, Gmel. 



I know of but one fossil species of this genus, if indeed it really belongs to it, 

 in the Eocene formation. I propose it at present as the type of a subgenus, to 

 which I can refer no other species. 



Suhgemis Lacinia, Con. 



Globose ; pillar lip widely reflected, callous ; basal emargination profound ; 

 base dilated. 



1 have given a name to this subgenus which Humphreys applied to some un- 

 known shell without describing it.

 somewhat turrited ; columella with 2 prominent plaits and 3 obsolete ones. 

 Length U inch. 



Locality. Bashia creek, Clarke co., Alab. 



I have given Mr. Tuomey's name to this interesting shell which was originally 

 referred by him to V. Sayana with doubt. Mr. Tuomey says the group of fossils 

 in this locality are very distinct from those of Claiborne, and I have no doubt the 

 deposit will prove to be an upper bed of the Eocene which may, when the fossils 

 are all collected, be found to contain some of the species of the Older Miocene as 

 it occurs at Vicksburg, Miss. The Athleta Tuomeyi, though a very distinct 

 shell, is related to a Miocene fossil of Dax, {A. rarispina,) which is an abundant 

 species. The genus appears to have no living representative.

Size smaller than B. lineatus, wings long and pointed, with the third primary 

 longest, second rather longer than the fifth, first about the same length as the 

 sixth. Entire plumage of the upper parts dark brownish with a purplish lustre, 

 especially obvious on the primaries. Plumage of the head and neck behind and 

 some feathers on the back edged and tipped with yellowish white, upper tail 

 coverts yellowish white with transverse bars of brown. Tail above dark ashy 

 brown, with about ten bands of dark brown and tipped with white. Entire 

 under parts and under wing coverts fine pale yellowish white with a few sagit- 

 tate spots of brown on the sides, and a distinct stripe of brown running down- 

 wards from the corner of the mouth. Front at the base of the upper mandible 

 white. Cere, legs and irides yellow. 



Younger ? Entire upper parts very dark brown or nearly black with purplish 

 lustre, and entire under parts with almost every feather having a large longitu- 

 dinal stripe or spot of the same, this color (brownish black) predominating on 

 the breast, and on the throat assuming the form of narrow longitudinal stripes. 

 Flanks and under wing coverts with rounded spots of w hite. Tibiae dark brown 

 with transverse bars and rounded and oval spots of pale reddish white. Upper 

 tail coverts reddish white with their outer edges brown, and with transverse 

 stripes of brown. Under tail coverts yellowish -white with transverse stripes of 

 brown. Stripes from the corners of the mouth wide and conspicuous. Front 

 white, cheeks yellowish white. Sex unknown. 



Dimensions Female. Total length 19^ inches, wing 14, tail S, extent of 

 wings 48 inches, tail about an inch longer than the folded wings. 



Hah. State of Wisconsin. 



Ohs Two specimens of this remarkable Buteo are now in the collection of 

 the Academy, for which it is indebted to Mr. William Dudley, Secretary of the 

 Wisconsin Natural History Association, and to P. R. Hoy, ?.I. D., of Racine, 

 Wisconsin. It bears a general resemblance to the European B. vulgaris, and 

 also to B. pennsylvanicHs, but is quite different from either and from any other 

 species known to me. 



Accompanying Dr. Hoy's specimen were some interesting notes of the manners 

 of this species, with measurements of the recent bird. It is named by him in 

 honor of our mutual and highly esteemed friend Professor Spencer F. Baird, of the 

 Smithsonian Institution, one of the most eminent of American naturalists, and 

 whose exertions have contributed in a most important manner to the development 

 of the natural history of the United States.

455 



During the past year the By-laws have been altered as follows : 



Art. III. of Chapter III., strike out the word fifty and insert ont hundred, 

 making the clause to read as follows : 



Art. III. But any member who shall pay into the hands of the Treasurer the 

 sum of one hundred dollars shall be exempt from all future semi-annual contribu- 

 tions. 



Art. I. of Chapter VIII, altered to read as follows : 



Any Specimen belonging to the Academy and not presented under restrictions, 

 may be loaned to members or correspondents for purposes of scientific investiga- 

 tion by the consent of three-fourths of the Curators, and for a period not exceed- 

 ing three months ; any person to whom specimens may be loaned shall first 

 deposit with the Curators a sum, not less than Fifty Dollars, in cash, which they 

 may deem necessary to ensure the safe return of the specimen, and he shall be 

 subject to a fine equal in amount to one-third of the security given, for each 

 month that the specimen may be retained beyond the time specified for its re- 

 turn. The specimen loaned, together with the date at which its return may be 

 due, shall be reported to the Academy by the Curators at the meetings for Busi- 

 ness in March, June, September and JDecember. 

 All of which is respectfully submitted by 



B. Howard Rand, 



Recording Secretary. 



The Librarian read the following : 



REPORT FOR 1853. 



The entire additions to the Library for the present year amount to 1011 ; of 

 which 436 are in volumes, 432 in parts or numbers, and the remaining 143 in 

 pamphlet form. They may be classified as follows : 



Natural Sciences, . 

 Anatomy and Physiology, 

 Physical Science and Chemistry, 

 Journals, Transactions, Proceed- 

 ings, &c. of Societies, . 

 Voyages and Travels, 

 Geography, .... 

 Biography, .... 

 Languages, .... 

 Agriculture, .... 

 Miscellaneous, f . 



Totals, 436 432 143 



Of the whole number, we have received from Authors 68, from Editors 39 ; 

 from Societies and Corporations 170; from Dr. Wilson 266; from Edward 

 Wilson, Esq. 407 ; from other Members, Correspondents, &c. ^^ ; and from the 

 United States Government 5. Total 1011. 



The number of volumes now in the Library may be estimated at nearly 16,000, 

 including tracts bound in volumes, or arranged for binding. Of these about 5000 

 are on subjects of Natural Science, nearly 3000 volumes of Trai^actions, and about 

 1500 volumes of Voyages and Travels, and Anatomy and Physiology. 



An opportunity for a correct enumeration will be afforded, it is hoped, during 

 the coming year, when the contemplated enlargement of the accommodations for 

 the Library will be completed. 



The increase in the number of additions this year from Foreign Societies is very 

 gratifying, most of them having been obtained by exchange of publications. 




456 [December, 



Further effort might, however, secure many other important acquisitions to the 

 list, which are much needed, and frequently inquired for. 



The necessity for a Library Fund, for binding and incidental expenses is be- 

 coming every year more urgent. For a long period the Society has been unable 

 to make any provision of this kind from the Treasury, in consequence of which 

 large collections of Tracts, Periodicals, and volumes bound in paper, have ac- 

 cumulated, and are with difficulty preserved from loss or injury. 



We have now many hundred such volumes, and certainly not less than 2500 

 Tracts, the binding of which, however plainly and economically done, would 

 require a considerable expenditure. The improved condition of the Treasury of 

 late will perhaps authorise an appropriation to this objectfat present, and when- 

 ever hereafter a surplus fund at the end of each year would admit of it, subject 

 to the approbation of the Treasurer. The attention of the Society to this matter 

 is earnestly requested. 



We hope, however, that the day is not distant, when a permanent Library 

 Fund will be established, not simply for meeting the ordinary expenses of a 

 large Library, but sufficient for a regular annual outlay for new scientific publi- 

 cations. 



Respectfully submitted by Wm. S. Zantzinger, 



Librarian. 



Hall of the Academy of Natural Sciences ^ December 27, 1853. 



The following Report was read by Dr. Leidy : 



REPORT OF THE CURATORS FOR 1853. 



The great increase of the Cabinet of the Academy has rendered an enlarge- 

 rnent of its building absolutely necessary, not only to accommodate new collec- 

 tions which may be received, but also to arrange those already in our possession. 

 The means through which this much desired object has nearly been accomplished, 

 were obtained from members of the Society and liberal citizens of Philadelphia ; 

 and we shall soon have almost double the space previously occupied by the mu- 

 seum. The alterations and enlargement of the building, now in progress of 

 completion, mainly consist of an additional story, the floor of which rests upon 

 the upper gallery of the former hall. The new hall has three ranges of galleries, 

 while the former, in its present condition, has but two. 



The natural history collections are to be removed from the east basement room 

 to the upper halls, and this is to be appropriated to the library, which then will 

 occupy the entire basement of the building, except a room for unpacking, &c., 

 and a small office for the Committee of Publication. 



Another important arrangement to be made is the construction of small 

 rooms for the different committees, which will afford increased facilities in the 

 transaction of business and the arrangement of the museum. Four of these will 

 be made in the upper hall, and three in the lower one. 



During the year just about closing, the donations to the museum, except in one 

 department, that of comparative anatomy, have been unusually small, which, 

 however, in part arises from the approaching completeness of several of its col- 

 lections. The donations in the different classes of natural history are as follows: 



Mammalia. Of this class 32 species have been presented, principally by Dr* 

 Heermann, Dr. Watson, Col. McCall, and Mr. J. Krider. 



Aves. Of mounted specimens of birds, and of bird-skins, there have been re- 

 ceived 107 of 73 species, of which one collection of 23 species of birds of Cali- 

 fornia was presented by Dr. Heermann, and 32 species collected in the western 

 territories were presented by Col. McCall. 




1853.] 457 



Of nests, those of 2 species of birds, and of eggs, those of 4 species have been 

 presented. 



Reptilia. Of this class 57 specimens of 35 species have been presented, prin- 

 cipally by the Smithsonian Institution. Besides these Dr. Ford, of the Gaboon 

 mission, presented a valuable collection from Western Africa. 



Pisces. 6 species of fishes have been presented. 



Molhisea. A large collection of marine shells from Lower California were 

 presented by Dr. Heermann, and a small collection from Texas by Dr. Engel- 

 mann, besides which Mr. Lea presented an interesting specimen of Fholas dac- 

 tylusy piercing gneiss. 



Crustacea. Of this class 9 species have been presented, principally by the 

 Smithsonian Institution. 



Lisectay Myriapoda and Zoophyta. A collection of insects and myriapods of 

 Western Africa was presented by Dr. Ford, and several species of insects from 

 the same locality by Dr. Hays. A few insects and echinoderms from Texas 

 were presented by Dr. Engelmann. 



Comparative Anatomy. To this department, during the past year, the cabinet 

 has received the richest accessions. 



The entire anatomical collection of our late lamented president, Dr. Morton, 

 consisting of 867 human crania, 601 crania of inferior animals, and other osteo- 

 logical specimens, was purchased by a number of members and liberal citizens 

 and presented to the Academy. 



Mr. Fahnestock presented a collection of 33 crania of birds and mammals. 

 Besides these 10 other, anatomical specimens have been received, among which 

 are a fine cranium of Phoca hptonyxy presented by Lieut. M. G. Watson, 

 U. S. N., one of Aiichenia Lama^ presented by Dr. James M. Greene, U. S. N., 

 and one of an aboriginal American by Dr. R. W. Gibbes. 



Botany. Our herbarium has been enriched by a collection of Arctic plants, 

 presented by Dr. E. K. Kane, U. S. N., and one of 61 species of woods from Dr. 

 Engelmann, of St. Louis. Besides the above, 59 botanical specimens were pre- 

 sented, among which is a collection of marine algae from Mr. Ashmead, and 16 

 species of fruits from Mr. Ellis Yarnall, Jr. 



Palaeontology. 112 specimens of organic remains have been presented, prin" 

 cipally from Dr. A. T. King, Mr. L. J. Germain, and Mr. T. Conrad. Among 

 them is the unique specimen of the Bathygnathus borealisy of the New Red Sand- 

 stone of Prince Edward's Island, presented by Messrs. Lea, Vaux and Dr. Leidy. 



Mineralogy. Of minerals 31 specimens have been presented, prmcipally by 

 Mr. C. M. Wheatley and Dr. Rand. 



The above report is respectfully submitted by 



Joseph Leidy, 

 December 2'7th, 1853. Chairman of the Curators. 



Tbe Annual Report of the Treasurer was read and referred to the 

 Auditors. 



Mr. Yaux offered a Resolution which was adopted, *' that the privilege 

 of endorsing tickets of admission to the Museum on public days be 

 granted to Mrs. Wetherill, widow of our late^ esteemed :Vice Presi- 

 dent, John Price Wetherill, and that she be authorised and invited to 

 visit at all times the Museum and Library of the Academy.'

The foregoing catalogue of birds' eggs embraces 1323 determined species of 

 493 genera. Of these, 835 species, derived from all parts of the world, formed 

 the celebrated and valuable collection of Mons. 0. Des Murs, of Paris. The 

 Australian species, numbering 246, accompanied the splendid collection of birds 

 from that country, made by the distinguished ornithologist Mr. John Gould, of 

 London, and which is now in the Museum of the Academy. The Cuba species 

 belonged to the collection of the well known naturalist M. Ramon de la Sagra, 

 and were presented by Mr. E. Wilson. 



The whole of the two first collections were purchased by Dr. T. B. Wilson, 

 and, with his usual liberality, presented to the Academy. The remainder con- 

 sists of species presented by several individuals whose names are attached to 

 their donations throughout the catalogue. Of undetermined eggs in the collec- 

 tions of M. Des Murs and Mr. Gould, there are 197 species.
