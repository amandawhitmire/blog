On Gordius^ and on some Parasites of the Rat. — Prof. Leidy 

 exhibited a curious knotted mass of living hair-worms, Gordius 

 7'obustus? which had been sent to him by Dr. S. T. Roman, of 

 Conowingo, Cecil Co., Md. The mass had been picked up in a 

 gutter at the edge of a forest near Conowingo, on a rainy morning 

 of Dec. 15, 1878. It contained 52 male individuals, and T females. 

 The former ranged from 8 to 25 centimetres in length, b^' i to f 

 of a millimetre in thickness; the latter range from 14 to 19^ cen- 

 timetres in length, bj- 1 millimetre in thickness. The females are

geneiall}' of much lighter color, and more robust character tlian 

 the males. In both sexes the body is most attenuated anteriorly, 

 but in the female the body is neai'ly as thick at the posterior ex- 

 tremity as it is at the middle. Some of the smaller males are pale 

 brownish-white, but most of them, from the smallest to the largest, 

 are of various shades of brown to chocolate-brown. The females 

 are pale brownish to darker brownish. In both sexes the head 

 forms a convex, whitish eminence, encircle<l by a narrow black 

 ring, from which a l»and of brown extends dorsally and ventrally 

 along the bod}'. The posterior end f>f the bod^' is likewise of 

 daiker color than the part just in advance. 



The tail of tlie male makes a spiral turn inwardly, and is furcate. 

 The forks are short, curved, sliglitly divergent, blunt conical pro- 

 cesses. Just in advance of their conjunction internally, tiiere 

 exists an inverted crescentic fold of browner color than the con- 

 tiguous parts, and immediately in advance is the genital pore. 

 The interval of the caudal forks is smooth, or free from papillae. 



The tail of the female appears truncated; is bluntly rounded, 

 feelily clavate, or slightly thicker than just in advance, and nearly 

 as thick as the middle of the body. It presents a terminal pore, 

 marked by a brown spot, and encircled with a i)rown ring. 



Under a moderate magnifying power, the brown integument is 

 minutely mottled with whitish spots, and it exhibits fine longitu- 

 dinal and diagonal striation. In sunlight it is beautifully irides- 

 cent as in the earth-worm. 



The worms are still quite lively. When disentangled and left 

 alone the}' soon become again knotted together in a compact 

 rounded mass as at present, with the heads divergent, and writhing 

 60 as to remind one of the head of the fabled Medusa. 



Prof. Leid}' then directed attention to several other specimens 

 which had been sent to him for information. One of these is a 

 bunch of tapeworms, 15 individuals of Taenia diminula. from the 

 intestine of a rat. The other is the liver of a rat, with a multitude 

 of cysts, the size of large peas, containing CyMicercu^ fasciolaria. 

 In a letter, accomi)anying the s})ecimens. Dr. John R. Hewett 

 states, that last spring he had examined al)out 500 rats ( J/«.s de- 

 cmnanuii), in Carroll Co., Mo., and only in half a dozen in.'itances 

 did he find the liver free from the parasite. 



Messrs. Geo. A Binder, Jacob Binder, Charles Henr}'^ Hart, and 

 H. Dumont Wagner were elected members. 



The following papers were ordered to be printed: —

NOTE ON HYRACETJM. 

 BY WM. H. GREENE, M.D., AND A. J. PARKER, M.D. 



Among the native remedies from the Cape of Good Hope, ex- 

 hibited at the Centennial Exhibition, was a peculiar substance 

 called h3'raceum, which was supposed to be the inspissated urine 

 of the Cape Hjrax (^Hyrax capensis). 



The material was obtained from Dr. Leidy, who, in the Pro- 

 ceedings of tlie Acadeni}', December, 1816, p. 325, gave a short 

 account of it. According to this account, " the Hyrax is reputed 

 to inhabit gregariously rockj' places at the Cape of Good Hope, 

 and the accumulated urine in the hollows of rocks, gradually 

 evaporating, is su[)posed to give rise to the product in question. 

 It is reported as having been employed in medicine with the same 

 effect as castoreum." 



Prof. Cope remarked that " a material resembling the concre- 

 tion made by the urine of the Hyrax was found in the fissures of 

 the rocks of New Mexico. It is probably the fecal and renal 

 deposit of the wild rat, Neotomay 



About two 3'ears ago, we made an exhaustive examination of 

 this substance. It is a dark-brown, brittle, and resinous material, 

 having an aromatic odor, and a bitter taste. About 56 per cent, 

 of it is soluble in water, and nearly- one-third of the residue from 

 the aqueous extraction is soluble in alcohol, ether, and chloroform. 



The soluble material amounts in all to about YO per cent., and 

 the remainder is composed of 14 per cent, of woody fibre and 

 insoluble organic material, and 16 per cent, of sand and other 

 inorganic substances. 



On ignition, hyraceum yields about 34 per cent, of ash, which 

 is composed of chlorides, sulphates, phosphates, and carbonates 

 of the alkaline metals, and of lime and magnesia. It also contains 

 nitrates in small proportion. 



On precipitating the organic material contained in the aqueous 

 extract with lead acetate, and afterwards decomposing the sus- 

 pended precipitate by means of sulphuric acid, a substance was 

 obtained which constitutes the greater portion of the organic 

 material soluble in water. It was hard, horn}-, and of a resinous 

 character, transparent, and of a bright brown tint. It probably 

 consists of several substances, but we were unable to obtain a

sufBcient quaiitit}' for separation, and an ultimate organic analysis. 

 It gives out a fecal odor, and seems to be derived from fecal matter. 



The analysis, the details of which are sulijoined, shows that the 

 substance is a mixture of various salts and organic matter, the 

 latter constituting about one-half, and containing traces of urea, 

 togetlu^r with uric, hippuric, and benzoic acids. We also ol)tained 

 from tiie material a small quantity of a substance having a sweet 

 taste, and which is probably glycocol(?) derived from the breaking 

 up of hippuric into benzoic acid,. and this substance. 



Hyraceum is undoubtedly derived from the urine of some animal, 

 but the large amount of lime (0 iier cent.) in proportion to the 

 other salts, and the character of the organic matter contained, in- 

 dicates that it also contains fecal matter. 



Analytiis of Hyraceum. — Water, by dessication, 7 per cent. 



A microscopical examination revealed nothing of importance. 

 Woody fibres, particles of sand, and a general granular appear- 

 ance were found.

MORPHOLOGICAL NOTES ON THE LIMBS OF THE AMPHITJMID^, AS 

 INDICATING A POSSIBLE SYNONYMY OF THE SUPPOSED GEaERA. 



BY JOHN A. RYDER. 



Little attention has ap[)arentl3^ been given to the comparative 

 history of the limbs of the known species of Amphiuma. Very 

 young specimens do not seem to have been usually collected for 

 museums. I have had the opportunity to stud3' such a series 

 varjing from 6 to 8 inches long, and about ^th inch, or a little 

 more, in diameter; the}^ were obtained in the vicinity of Biloxi, 

 Mississippi, and are the propertj' of the Smithsonian Institution 

 at TTashington. 



From these it appears that the digital elements of the limbs 

 are variable, or liable to variation in the same individual, so that 

 in some the number of digits (two) is characteristic of Amphiuma, 

 and in others (three) they are characteristic of Mursenopsis. This 

 blending of the characters of the two genera may be illustrated 

 as follows, indicating the number of digits on each limb by nume- 

 rals, arranged in fours, the first pair representing the digital for- 

 mula of the four limbs, thus: (1) | 1; (2) | | ; (3j % |; and (4) 

 2 I ; there was also a form which exhibited no outward indication 

 of toes on the front pair of limbs, the digits being inclosed in a 



common investing integument ; this fifth form may be represented 



30 3 

 in this manner — p. It is plain from the foregoing, that at no very 



remote period the two forms which are now believed to character- 

 ize distinct genera were probably one and the same. The three- 

 toed form {Murfenoj'jsU) is said to be confined to the Southern 

 United States, whilst the two-toed form {Ampjhiuma) is more 

 widely distributed, extending farther north, and also embracing 

 the distribution of the former. The digital formula of (1) is 

 Amphiuma in the front pair, and Mursenopsis in the hind pair of 

 limbs; that of (2) is Amphiuma on one side in the hinder pair, 

 and Mursenopsis on the other. Normal individuals of both genera 

 also occur, as in (3) and (4); while (5) represents the beginning 

 of the differentiation of a third generic type, if the number of 

 digits be good and sufficient to characterize genera. Prof. Cope, 

 who has probably liandled more specimens of Amphibia than any 

 other American naturalist, informs me that he thinks these varia- 




1S70.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 15 



lions very uncommon, as he lias never in his experience met with 

 any instance in which tliere was as much variation in tiie number 

 of digits as exliibited in these Biloxi specimens. They can liardly, 

 however, be regarded as monstrosities, as the percentage of varying 

 specimens in tliis series is entire!}' too liigh. I am inclined to be- 

 lieve that the\' are simply instances on the one hand of reversion 

 toward a still older, and more nnspecialized type, and on the 

 other of a tendency to become specialized or reduced, as in the 

 case where the two digits are covered l>y a common tegumental 

 investment. If the distribution of species will in any case serve 

 to throw light upon the difterentialion of genera, I tliink that in 

 this instance we ma}' assume, with much show of reason, that the 

 individuals most remote from the centre of maximum development 

 of species and indivi<luals exiiihit the greatest tendency towaids 

 digital reduction. The most northern form, Amphiuma, seems to 

 be constantly didactyle, whilst the more southern forms are both 

 di- and tridactyle, which would seem to indicate that the forms 

 most remote from the centre of distribution have been under con- 

 ditions tending to produce didactylism synchronously with di- and 

 tridactylism at the centre aforementioned. This, however, is only 

 a hypothetical view of the case. 



The admission of JFuraenopsis and Amphiuma to generic rank on 

 account of a difference, which is here shown not to be constant, is 

 doubtful. The digits, which from the fact of their having under- 

 gone reduction, seem to be not so much rudiments as vestiges of 

 former digits, render the legitimacy of the distinction even more 

 open to question. For I think it cannot be doul>ted that such 

 a tendenc}' to degenerate, accompanied with a consequent ten 

 dency to produce synthetic characters, shows clearly that nature 

 has not yet concluded tiiat they shall be genera, notwithstanding 

 the dicta and detinitions of systematists.

ON THE LAND SHELLS OF THE MEXICAN ISLAND OF GDADELDPE, 

 COLLECTED BY DR. E. PALMEE. 



BY W. G. BINNEY. 



The island of Gnudeliipe is about 220 miles from San Diego, off 

 tlie west coast of Lower California. Its molluscous fauna has for 

 the first time been made known by the researches of Dr. Edward 

 Palmer, who visited it in 1875. He found numerous fragments of 

 snail shells which had been devoured by a species of mouse, the 

 only inhabitant of the island. These fragments appear to belong 

 to Arionta Bowelli, Newcomb (see L. & F. W. Sh. of X. A. I. p. 

 185), a species found in Lower California. Some perfect shells 

 were found, among tliem a smaller variety. Arionta facia ^ Xew- 

 comb, was also found, the variety with open umbilicus, like that 

 form found fossil on San Nicolas Island, California. 



The most interesting discovery, however, is tliat of living spe- 

 cimens of Binneya notabiliH^ a species found also ou the California 

 Island of Santa Barbara. There is strong reason for believing 

 the Mexican genus Xanthonyx to be synonx'mous with Binneya. 

 We nia^' suppose, therefore, that from Mexico the genus has been 

 introduced by the usual means of distribution to this island of 

 Guadelupe, and thence to Santa Barbara. Thus, its presence on 

 the latter island is accounted for, which was not the case when 

 we had onl3^ the mainland of California to look to, as its absence 

 there has been proved. So, also, in the case of Arionta facta, we 

 ma}^ account for its distribution by supposing it to have been in- 

 troduced from some unknown locality on the mainland to Guade- 

 lupe first, and thence to the California islands. 



The specimens collected are in the Museum of the Boston 

 Societ}' of Natural IIistor3\ 



Four species of Ortlioptera were collected also. One of these 

 is siiown hy Dr. Scudder to be identical with a Mexican species, 

 and two of the others have also been found at San Diego.

LIST OF LAND SHELLS INHABITING EURTJTTJ, ONE OF THE AXJSTHAL

 RANGE, AND DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW SPECIES. 



BY ANDREW GARRETT. 



The small island of Rurutu = Oheatora of Capt. Cook, lies in 

 soutli lat. 22° 34',a"tl west Ion. 150° 13',wliieli is about 320 miles 

 S. S.W. from Tahiti. As near as I can ascertain it is about eight 

 miles in length, and has an elevation of about 1500 feet, over 100 

 feet of which consists of ancient coral reefs, which have been up- 

 heaved to that altitude. 



Mr. Hugh Cuming was the first who visited the island for the 

 purpose of collecting shells, and discovered two or three new spe- 

 cies. The next experienced collector, Mr. Charles De Gage, who 

 resides there, gathered a number of land shells, which he kindly 

 forwarded to me for identification, and which form the subject of 

 this paper.

It is smaller, and darker colored than suhfih's, which latter is 

 pale horn color, an<l six mill, in diameter. It is more like M. brun-

Patula Rurutuensis, sp. nov. 



Shell nmbllieate, discoid, thin, translucent, 3'ellowish-horn color, 

 the spire tessellated, and the last whorl with radiating flexuous 

 fuscous strii)es ; radiately ribbed witli small thin flexuous costiie, 

 and decussated with microscopical raised lines; spire depressly con- 

 vex ; suture sub-canaliculate; whorls 5, convex, narrow, slightly 

 turgid near the suture; slowl}'^ and regularly increasing, the last 

 not descending in front, sub-angular on the periphery'; umbilicus 

 deep, about one-fourth the major diameter of tlie shell; aperture 

 somewhat oblique, depressly lunate; parietal region with a small 

 revolving lamina on the upper third of the wall ; peristome acute, 

 straiglit, with remote margins. 



Major diameter 3^, height 2 mill. 



The fine spiral striffi, thin ribs, single parietal lamina, and de- 

 pressed sub-angular body whorl are its most prominent characters, 

 and will readily distinguish it from any of the south Polynesian 

 species. 



Pitys De Gagei, sp. nov. 



Shell umbilicate, sub-discoid, thin, translucent, corneous or lute- 

 ous, horn color, si)ire more or less distinctly tessellated with chest- 

 nut-brown, and the last whorl radiatelj- strigate with the same hue, 

 the stripes sometimes flexuous, and the base either unicolor or 

 adorned with stripes; sculptureconsistingof fine, closely-set, radiat- 

 ing, slightly arcuate, thin, costulatestriae, smaller and more crowded 

 beneath; spire convex, apex planulate ; suture canaliculate ; whorls 

 6, convex, narrow, swollen next the suture, slowl}' and regularly 

 increasing, the last not deflected in front, slightly depressed, and 

 somewhat tumid ; base moderately convex, with a small but deep 

 umbilicus; aperture slightly oblique, narrow, lunate; the palate 

 with five, and the parietal wall with three revolving lamina; peris- 

 tome acute, straight, margins remote.

Judging from the nmiiber sent this is an abundant species. A 

 few years ago I received a large quantitj' from Tidjuai, also one 

 of the Austral group, and nearly 100 miles east of Rurutu. That 

 grou[) is, witliout doubt, its specific centre, or metroj^olis. 



The most surprising feature in the geographical distribution of 

 this speci'^s is its occurrence in three distinct groups of islands. 

 It is found, though sitaringly, in nearly ever3- valle}' in Tahiti, 

 ■nhich is over 300 miles from its metropolis. I also obtained it at 

 Mangaia, one of the Cook's or Hervey Islands, 400 miles west of 

 Rurutu. 



Had it onl}' been detected in one or two valle^-s in Tahiti, its 

 introduction could have been attributed to human agency. But 

 when we consider its wide difl'usion we can only account for its 

 presence either by a separate creation of the same species in three 

 groups of islands, or speculate on its distribution in some remote 

 period, when the three groups formed a single large island, or 

 part of a continent. 



After a careful comparison of man\' examples from the three 

 groups of islands, I cannot detect the slightest variation. Shells 

 from the same localit}- var}- slightly in the length of the sjjire, in 

 size and thickness. 



It is a strictly arboreal species, and may be distinguished by 

 its uniform white color, flat, and widely-expanded peristome, and 

 gibbous columella lip. 



Reeve's figure is too much elongated.

 Buliinus upolensis, Pfeiffer, !Mon. Hfl. vol. VI. p. 100. 



This common species is ver^' widely diffused through Polynesia. 

 I have found it inhabiting all the groups north of the equator, 

 and south at all the islands from the Marquesas anrl Paumotus to 

 the Viti group, and, in all jn-obabilit}', it ranges further west. 



They are found under loose stones, beneath decayed wood, and 

 among dead leaves, and range from near the seashore to 2000 or 

 more feet above sea-level. The animal is light yellow.

The few specimens received differ none from Tahitian and Cook's 

 Islands exami)les. 



At the latter location I found tlieni in vast numbers on stony 

 ground in a grove near tlie seashore, but comjjaratively rare in 

 the mountain ravines. It occurs in more or less abundance at all 

 the Polynesian Islands, also at the Yiti group, and perhaps ex- 

 tends further west. 



I obtained Mr. Pease's type specimens of nitens at Elion, a low 

 coral island in the Caroline or Marshall group. When he de- 

 scribed tiiat species he was not aware that Mr. Shuttleworth had 

 anticipated him in his pediculus, described from Tahitian and 

 Marquesian examples. 



It is evident from Mr. Pease's remarks on page 463, Proceedings 

 of the Zoological Society for 1871, that lie entertained doubts of 

 the specific weight of his nitenti and Gould's nacca. 



Man}' years ago I collected a species of Vertigo near Hilo, 

 Hawaii, wliere Dr. Gould's types were obtained, and as near as I 

 can recollect they differed none from pediculus. 



The description of nacca is so brief and unsatisfactory- tliat I 

 cannot decide with certainty, so have mai'ked it doubtful. 



Tiie following is Gould's diagnosis: — 



"T. ovata, lucida, alabastrica, tennuissima, striata; anfr. 4 + 

 ventricosus apice ol tuso ; sutura j)rol'unda ; a|)ertura subcircularis 

 dente i)alatali (interdum bifido) dente columellari, dente basali 

 denteque labiali armala; peritreraate valde reflexo ; umbilico ri- 

 mato. — Axis y\y, diam. J^^, poll" (Gould). 



With resi)ect to Zelebor's hyalina, which is elaborately de- 

 scribed. I do not hesitate to add it to the synonymy of pediculus. 



The vaiiation of pediculus consists in the more or less oblong 

 form, distinctness of striation, more or less turgid whorls, com- 

 pression of the base, and size of the rimate umbilicus. The 

 parietal lamina is usually double, though often single, or bifurcate, 

 and like the columellar tooth is constant. The palate is usually 

 furnished with three teeth, whicli may be considered the normal 

 number, though they frequentlj- vary, and ma}- be altogether

absent. Sometimes they are duplicated, or douMe, and more 

 rarely may be seen rudimentary or secondary denticles besides 

 tlie normal niunl)er.

 Tornatellina bacillaris, 3Iousson, Jour, de Conch. 1871, p. 16, pi. 3,

 A common species, ranging from the Marquesas and Paumotus 

 to the Samoa Islands, and perhaps extends further west to the 

 Viti group. 



Prof. Mousson gives an accurate description of oblonga under 



the name bariUai'is, from Samoa examples collected by Dr. Graffe. 



The}- are found among dead wood and leaves, and sometimes on 



the fronds of ferns. Tliey range from near the seashore to "2000 



or more feet above sea-level. 



Mr. Pease's type specimens were collected at the Society Islands.

 Cionella {Leptinaria) conica, Paetel, Cat. Conch. Sam. p. 106. 

 Tornatellina ohlonga. Pease (Part), Proc. Zool. Soc. 1864, p. 673. 



This species, which is not uncommon, ranges from the Marque- 

 sas to the Viti Islands, and was collected by Dr. Grart'e on the 

 low coral islands of EUice's group in central Polynesia. 



Mr. Pease received from me some of these shells intermixed 

 ■with oblonga. and supposing the two to be identical he included 

 them in his diagnosis of that species. Since then I have collected 

 thousands of specimens of both species at the various groups ; 

 and have hundreds now before me of all ages, and do not hesitate 

 to pronounce them quite distinct. The shell under consideration 

 I refer to Mousson's conica. His variet}- impressa is not un- 

 common in S. K. Polynesia. 



As compared with oblonga, it is lighter colored, more robust, 

 the spire more tapering, bod\' whorl larger, and freciueiitly wiih a 

 marked depression in the middle, whiih is sometimes sliglilly 

 concave. The parietal lamina is larger, and the columella more 

 tortuous.

Tiiere were several examples of this species among ^Ir. De 

 Gage's .shells, wliicli differed none from Tahitian specimens. It 

 also occurs at the Cook's and ^Marquesas Islands, though not 

 common at any of the above-mentioned locations. 



It may he readil}' distinguished bv its swollen whorls, globose 

 body, large compressed parietal lamina, and somewhat tortuous 

 columella, which in 3^oung examples is biplicate. 



Tornatellina simplex, Pease. 



TorniiteUina simplex. Pease, Proc. Zool. See. 1864, p. 673 — PfeifiFer,

Not uncommon at Rurutu, and we found it at the Marquesas, 

 Society, and veiy abundant at the Cook's Islands. 



It agrees precisely with ^Ir. Pease's description of simplex, 

 except having one more whorl, and all have the usual, though 

 smaller parietal lamina, which he must either have overlooked or 

 omitted to mention. I collected his type specimens at Tahaa, 

 one of the Society Islands, and am positive this is the shell I sent 

 him. At least I do not know of any species without the parietal 

 lamina. Moreover, this is the only umbilicated species he received 

 from me.

Ti>ni(((ellina nitid((, Pease, Proc. Zool. Soc. 1860, p. 439 — Pfeiffer, Mon. 

 Hel. vol. VI. p. 264. 



This common species inhabits all the islands in southeastern 

 Polynesia, and extends its range through the smaU islands in cen- 

 tral Polynesia to the Caroline or Marshall's group, where I ob- 

 tained ^Ir. Pease's type specimens. 



His diagnosis not being ver^' satisfactor}-, I subjoin the follow- 

 ing description; — 



Shell small, imperforate, oblong, or elongate-conic, tliin, smootii, 

 shining, transparent, brownish-horn color; spire more or less 

 elongate-conic, with sub-planulate outlines, and obtuse apex; 

 suture well defined, linear ; whorls 5-6, strongly convex, slowl}' 

 and regularly increasing, the last not descending in front, some-

times slightly flattened near the peristome; :i|teitiire oltlicine, 

 oblong, in aihilts about a third the lenuth of tlie shell ; paii'-lal 

 region with a thin, prominent Ininina, whit h runs nearly parallel 

 ■with the suture; peristome straight, acute, with the margins re- 

 mote; columella tortuous, the lower margin armed with a thin, 

 acute, sliglitly oblique fold ; the palate frequently with one or two 

 spiral rows of small comi)ressed denticles. 



Length 3, major diameter 1;^ mill. 



A thin transparent species, with a more tapering spire than 

 oblovgo, with the twisted columella of coniea, but readily distin- 

 guished from either by the acute plication in the columella, which 

 can onl}- be distinctly seen when looking obliquely into the ai)er- 

 ture. Owing to the transparency of the shell, the sutural line 

 appears to be narrowly margined. The palatal denticles, though 

 sometimes wanting, were overlooked by Mr. Pease. 



It is worthy of remark that the above author in his list of I'au- 

 motus shells received from me, and published in the French 

 Journal of Conchology lor ISTl, refers the S. E. Polynesia spe- 

 cies to his nitida. 



Tornatellina affinis, ."p. nov. 



Shell small, imperforate, ovate-conic, thin, smooth, shining, 

 transparent, light brownish-horn color; s\>\ve oMong-conic, with 

 planulate outlines ; apex obtusely rounded ; suture narrowly mar- 

 gined ; whorls six, plano-convex, slowly and regularly increasing, 

 the last not deflected in front, rather large; aperture oblique, 

 irregularly abbreviate ovate, a little more than a third the length 

 of the shell ; parietal wall with a strongly compressed prominent 

 lamina; i)eristome acute, straight, regularly curved, margins re- 

 mote; cfdumella tortuous, not i)licate or dentate. 



Length 2f, major diameter 1^. mill. 



This species, which we have ventured to record as new, is shap«'d 

 very much like rhih'i'in, but the whorls of the spire are flattened, 

 and the bod}* is not so turgid as in that species. The colunulla 

 has the peculiar twist of ronica^ but our shell is smoother, more 

 shining, the s[ure more tapering, and the whorls much more 

 depressed. 

 Tornatellina micani, sp. noT.

acute, ol)long-conic, sides planulate; suture distinctly and nar- 

 rowly marginate; whorls six, sub-planulate, slowly and regularly 

 increasing, the last rather large, not descending in front : aperture 

 oblique, ovate-lunate, more than a third the length of the shell ; 

 parietal wall with a prominent, strongly-compressed lamina ; pe- 

 ristome thin, simple, regularly curved : columella slightly twisted, 

 depressed, armed with a suh-median, nearly horizontal, acute tooth- 

 like fold ; palate with numerous irregularly disposed denticles. 



Length 2^, major diameter H mill. 



Tlie single example before me differs so much from any other 

 species, that, after some hesitation, 1 have concluded to describe 

 it as new. 



It is shaped almost precisely like aJHnis, but has the palatal 

 denticles, and acute, columellar, tooth-like plait of nitida. 



Tornatellina perpleza, .«p nov. 



2'ornutellina bilamellnia, Schmeltz (not Anton), Cat. Mus. Godoff. No.

Shell small, oblong-conic, imperforate, fragile, gloss}-, [lellucid, 

 smooili, pale brownish-horn color; spire oldong-conic, with sui»- 

 planuhite outlines; apex obtusely rounded; suture distinctly 

 linear; vvliorls six, convex, moderately and regularly increasing, 

 the last convexly rounded, not deflected in front; aperture ol)- 

 lique, ovate-lunate, about one tiiird the length of the shell ; peris- 

 tome thin, straight, regularly curved; columella depressed, tor- 

 tuous, bi-dentate, the basal tooth small, the upper, which is sub- 

 medial, is lai'ge and prominent; parietal region with a large, 

 l)rominent, curved lamina; palate garnished with more or less 

 numerous irregularly disposed denticles. 



Length 2|, major diameter 1 mill. 



Mr. De Gage sent a number of these shells of all ages, and I have 

 myself collected the same species at the Cook's- and Society 

 Islands. 



Its close resemblance to nilida has perplexed me so mucii that 

 I have long hesitated about the proijriety of separating the two 

 as distinct. 



It may, however, be distinguished from that s})ecies by its more 

 dilated and bidentate columella. The upper tooth is also larger, 

 and less acute than in nilida. Some examples have the palatal 

 denticles mounted on delicate, longiuidinal lines of callus. Others

 TornateUina (wri.«, Pfeiffer, :Mon. Hel. vol. VI. p. 266. 



This species has tlie same extensive range through Polynesia 

 as nitida. Many years ago I found the same, or a closely allied 

 species on low hushes near the seashore at Guam. 



They, like nearly all the species, are usualh- found adhering to 

 the under surface of loose stones, dead wood, among decayed 

 leaves, and sometimes on the leaves of low bushes. 



I obtained ^Ir. Pease's type examples of serrala at Ebon, in 

 Micronesia; and his Icen's at Huahine and Tahiti. Mr. Cuming, 

 who received specimens of both species, considered them identical. 



After a careful examination of a large number of all ages from 

 the different groups of islands, I find the palatal lamina much 

 more frequentl}' serrated than smooth. They are, in fact, all 

 smooth at certain periods of their growth. 



The description of ><er7-ata is somewhat obscure; that of /ar/'.s 

 is more accurate. 



It cannot well be confounded with any other Polynesian spe- 

 cies ; its ovate-conic form, swollen whorls, deep suture, acute 

 columellar to(jth, and, more particidarly. the remote longitudinal, 

 prominent, smooth, or serrated palatal lamime will readily distin- 

 guish it from any other. 



The last character induced Mr. Pease to establish his genus 

 LameUiiia. In his list of Polynesian land shells pulilished in the 

 Proceedings of the Zoological .^'ociety for 1871, he records only 

 two s|»ecies, his serrata an<l Ixois, while he overlooked the same, 

 but less conspicuous character in HidaUjoi, Crosse, iidialiiling tlie 

 Gaml»ier Islands. The accurate figure of that spt'cies in the 

 Journal de Conchyliologie for 18<)0, exhibits a small bidcntate 

 lamina. Specimens from the same locality, now before me, either 

 possess the same feature, or have simply from one to two spiral 

 rows of denticles in the palate.

26 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



Petit's glubosa, from Kapa ov Oj)ara is described as having two 

 obsolete plicae in tiie palate. In micans, perplexa^ and iiitida we 

 find short plicoe or denticles, and freqnentl}' rndimentar}- longitu- 

 dinal lamina. Some specimens of ^lYtfZa have the latter character 

 as strongly developed as in serrata. Prof. Mousson has described 

 a Yiti species under the name of coIuvwIla7'is, which is either the 

 same or very closely allied to nitida^ and possesses denticles in 

 the palate. 



If the genus Lamellina is accepted, it should be modified so as 

 to include all the species witli either denticles, plicae, or laminae in 

 the palate, though the character on which the genus is based is 

 not, in m}' opinion, of sufficient impoitance to rank as generic. 



There are several other species described, from other parts of 

 the world, which possess the same characters. 



Succinea De Gagei, sp. nov. 



Shell ovate, pale to dark-amber color, or ferrnginons, thin, fra- 

 gile, pellucid, scarcel}' shining, more or less rugose with lines of 

 growth; si)ire moderately produced, sub-acute, less than a third 

 the length of the shell; whorls 3-3 j, convexly rounded, the last 

 large, obliquely produced ; aperture sub-vertical, large, regnlarlj- 

 ovate, acute above, sides nearly equally curved, rounded below ; 

 columella thin, gently arched ; peristome acute, regularly curved. 



Length 11, major diameter 1 mill. 



Mr. De Gage sent about 100 examples of all ages: it is the 

 first species recorded from the Austral Islands. 



It is closel}' allied to Gould's pM(7ornia, a Taiiitian species, but 

 is smaller, less elongate, and the spire is less produced.

The Rurutu shells received differ none from those I collected at

From the above s3'nonymy and references it will be seen that 

 there is some confusion in respect to the interpretation of Lesson's 

 species, which he obtained at Borabora, one of the Society Islands. 



There are only five species of Mtlampus inhabiting that group.

and the3' are common to all the islands. Of these, striata, as far 

 as known, has not been discovered elsewhere ; while of the remain- 

 ing four species, luteua and fasciatut; are very widely diffused 

 through Polynesia, ]\Jelanesia, and the Indian Seas. M. Philippi 

 seems to be confined to southeastern Polynesia. All the above- 

 mentior.ed four species are correctly determined. We now have 

 onl}' the species under consideration to identify. 



In 1871, Mr. Pease published in the French Journal of Con- 

 chology a list of Anaa (Paumotus Isl.) land shells, collected b}- 

 me in 1865, and recorded this species as caffer, Kiist. Adopting 

 bis view I distributed the shells to my correspondents, under that 

 name. 



The same year he published his list of Polynesian land shells 

 in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society, and excluded coffer^ 

 but recorded violun from Borabora. 



Dr. PfeifTer's coffer, var. 3, which Mr. Cuming collected at Ku- 

 rutu, is undoubtedly the same as our shell. 



It is a very common species, and is confined to the Paumotus, 

 Society, and the Austral Islands. Its limited range also proves 

 its distinctness from coffer, which is recorded as a soutii African 

 and Philippine species. 



In shape, it resembles /ascia/a, and the last whorl is sub-angu- 

 late above. The spire is convexly conoid, mucronate, and nearly 

 one-third the length of the sh( 11 ; the upper whorls usually have 

 a few faint radiating incised lines. The well-impressed suture is 

 more or less lacerated by large wrinkles of growth on the last 

 wliorl. The base is sub-rimate, and sometimes decussated with a 

 few faintly-defined impressed strife. Parietal region with two, 

 sometimes tliree plicfe on the basal half, and the brownish-violet 

 columella has a rather small oblique fold. Tiie inner margin of 

 the peristome is always deep chestnut-brown, approaciiing black, 

 and the palate has 4-G l)luis!i-white pliciB. 



Living shells are uniform fuscous; frequently' the belly or front 

 of the last wliorl is brownish-yellow, with a transverse fuscous 

 band just beneath the middle. Sometimes, though more frequently 

 in immature examples, the ground-color is brownisli-yellow, with 

 the spire and upper portion of the last whorl, togetlier with u 

 sub-basal band, fuscous.

Shell small, limate, abbreviatel}- ovate, solid, faintly striate, 

 cinereous under a thin yellowish-olive epidermis; spire obtuse, 

 short, convexly-conicnl, more or less decorticated ; suture deeply 

 impressed ; whorls five, convex, the last very large, rounded, 

 nearly half the length of the shell, the periphery with a stout 

 rounded keel; basal carination large; aperture nearly vertical, 

 roundly-ovate, whitish or reddish yellow ; peristome rather thick,

Thev inhabit dr}- localities in forests, and are found adhering to 

 rocks, dead wood, and the under surface of loose stones. 



They var}- slightly in size, height of spire, distinctness and size 

 of the spiral, raised lines, whieh in some examples are obsolete. 

 The color is usually reddish-l)rown, sometimes ruddy corneous, 

 rarely pale 3'ellow. 



The geuus Choiidi^eUa was established b}' ^Mr. Pease in 1871, the 

 type of which is his Cijclo.^toma panum. In his list of Polynesian 

 land shells he records three species, his parva^ ^striata, and minu-

striala. Gycloatoma exigua, Iloiiib., also from the Gamliicrs, 

 prol>al»ly belongs to the same genus. 



Mr. Pease, in his description of the genus, remarks, from ol)ser- 

 vatioiis made hy me tliat the animal was destitute of tentacles. 

 Since the above was pnltlished, I have verified my former obser- 

 vations b}- a careful study of man}' examples of both striata, and 

 paroa. 



Tlie animal is translucent, and. excepting the large conspicuous 

 black eyes, is colorless in both species. The foot is small, oltlong, 

 rounded behind, and during locomotion is nearly or quite concealed 

 by the shell, which is carried diagonally. The iicad, wliich is en- 

 tirely destitute of tentacles, is produced into a siiort blunt muzzle, 

 which sometimes assumes a slightly bi-lobed appearance. When 

 creeping, only the extreme tip of the muzzle is seen from above, 

 while the conspicuous eyes are lilainl}' visible through the trans- 

 parent shell.

This small species is very abundant, and agrees in every respect 

 with Tahiti and Moorea examples. It is not found on any of tlie 

 other islands of the Society group, though several species inhabit- 

 ing the other islands are usually confounded with minuta, one of 

 wliich is described by Dr. Pfeitfer under that name. 



Sowerby 's type specimens were collected at Knrutu l)y Mr. 

 Cuming. His diagnosis, though very brief, accords well with the 

 shells before me. The size he gives is also precisel}- the same. 

 The shell described by Pfeilfer, winch is larger, is, as near as I 

 can determine, one of Mr. Pease's unpublished species, which in-

They are found under dead wood, among deca3'ed leaves, and 

 range from near the seashore to about 2000 feet above sea-level. 



The only variation is in size, more or less produced spire, and 

 color, which varies from a light to dark corneous, rarely brownish, 

 with faint indication of a band on the body whorl. 



I obtained Mr. Pease's t3'pe specimens of lucida in beach sand

DESCRIPTION OF A NEW SPECIES OF GONIOBRANCHUS. 

 BY ANDREW GARRETT. 

 Goniobranchus albopunctatas, Oarr. 



Animal elongate-oval, depressed, the two ends equally rounded, 

 a little the widest at the middle, and, when in motion, it becomes 

 more elongate, and the sides nearly parallel. The dorsal region 

 is depressly convex, smooth, and the margins of mantle thin. The 

 upper surface is bright orange-yellow, with crowded opaque white 

 dots, and minute annulse; the mantle witli a band of small irregu- 

 lar lemon-3'ellow spots near the margin, which latter is edged with 

 violaceous. 



The dorsal tentacles, which issue from simple orifices, are elon- 

 gate ovate, sub-mucronate, somewhat trigonal, purple-brown, pro- 

 fusely dotted with opaque white, and marked with two vertical 

 lines of the latter color. 



The branchial plumes are rather large, twelve in number, con- 

 nate at their base, decreasing in size posteriori}', and encircling 

 the prominent anal tube; they are colored and dotted similar to 

 the tentacles, and each ornamented with two longitudinal white 

 lines. 



The under surface of the mantle and foot are pale lemon-yellow, 

 the former margined the same as above. 



The head is small, and furnished with moderate, obtuse, cylin- 

 drical tapering labial ap[)endages. 



Tl)e foot is elongate, narrow, oI>tuseIy rounded in front, sides 

 parallel, rounded behind, and, when in motion, extends consider- 

 ably behind the mantle. 



Length, 62; diameter,. 20 millimetres.

A very rare species found on weedy bottom in the upper region 

 of tlie laminarian zone, and is the only example which has occur-

Fossil Remains of a Caribou. — Prof. Lei dy" directed attention 

 to several fossil specimens which he had received for determina- 

 tion from Prof. F. M. Witter, of Muscatine, Iowa. They were 

 found together, with others apparently of the same animal, in the 

 Loess on wliich the cit^' of Muscatine is built. 



Two of the fossils consist of fragments of the left side of tlie 

 upper and lower jaws, retaining most of the molar teeth iu good 

 condition. Another specimen is an uncharacteristic bone frag- 

 ment. Other bones were too much decomposed for preservation. 



The specimens with teeth indicate a species of deer, of an indi- 

 vidual past maturity, as the crowns of the teeth are half worn 

 away, exliibiting broad, comparativel}- flat surfaces. The charac- 

 ter of the fossils appeared unfamiliar, and at first were suspected 

 to have pertained to an extinct and undescribed species. The 

 proportionately large size of the premolars, in comparison with 

 those of ordinary forms of deer, appeared as a distinctive feature. 



Observing that the fossils were larger than the corresponding 

 parts of the l)arren ground- caribou, Rangifer groenlandicas^ it 

 was suspected that tiiey ma^' have pertained to the woodland 

 caribou, Rangifer caribou. In this view, not, having the latter 

 for comparison, the specimen of the upper jaw with the teeth was 

 sent to Dr. p]lliott Cones, of Washington, with the request that 

 he sliould compare it with specimens of the woodland caribou in 

 the collection of the Smithsonian Institution. 



Dr. Coues re|)orts that the fossil was carefully compared witli 

 numerous specimens of caribou, and he adds: "I think you may 

 safely announce Rangifer caribou from the Loess of Iowa." He 

 further remarks, that ''the specimen is more worn as to the teeth 

 than an^' 1 find to eom|)are with it, being ground away so that 

 almost the broadest looking set of surfaces presents. Making 

 due allowance for this, I find nothing incompatible wiiii the spe- 

 cific characters of the living w'oodland caril)OU. The lengths of 

 the wiiole molar series, as well as of the premolars and molars, 

 are substantially identical ; bend of the series and set of the teeth 

 also the same." 



Comparative measurements of the upper molar series of the 

 fossil caribou, with the corresponding series of a woodland cari- 

 bou from Fort Anderson, given hy Dr. Coues, are as follows: —

 The President, Dr. Ruschenberger, in the chair. 

 Thirty-one persons present. 



Natima of Botel Tobago. — The President read the following 

 extract from a letter by Dr. Charles A. Siegfried, U. S. N., 

 dated December 20, 1878: ''We visited an island called Botel 

 n'obago. while surveying a rock, 80 miles east of South Cape of 

 Formosa. We found a race of altorigines, probably from Malay 

 stock. They knew nothing of money, rum, or tobacco. They 

 gave us goats and pigs for tin pots and brass buttons, and would 

 hang around us all day in their canoes, waiting for a chance to 

 dive for something thrown overboard. They wore clouts only; 

 ate taro and yams mainly, though they have pigs, goats, chickens, 

 and fish, and cocoanuts also. Snakes abound, of the boa variety 

 I judge. Their thatch houses are low, with much overhang of the 

 roof, surrounded by stone w;alls, strongly made of laid stone to 

 protect them from monsoons. Their pad<ly fields contain im- 

 mense quantities of laro, C'olocasia aroidea my botany says. 

 They are peaceful and timid, do not mark the body or deform the 

 face or teeth, and seem happy enough in their condition. I found 

 them fairly healthy. They had axes, spears, and knives, but all 

 of common iron, the axe being made by imbedding the handle 

 instea<l of the handle piercing the irf)n, as with us. Their 

 canoes are beautifid, made without nails, and are ornamented 

 usually with geometrical lines. The hair is worn naturally, the 

 men partly clipping tlu-irs. I saw no valuable metal. They wore 

 the beards of goat>i, with small shells, as nei-k ornaments." 



Cutting or I'arasol Ant, Atla feri-eiiff. Say — The Kev. H. C. 

 McCodK stated that he had in course of iireparation a detailed 

 account of the architecture and habits of the Cutting Ant of 

 Texas. Tiie observations, of which he proceeded to give an al)- 

 stract, were made during an encampment for purposes of study, 

 south of Austin, Texas. 



1. Exterior Architt-cture. — Two forms were noted. The first, 

 seen at a point distinguished as Camp Wright, was that of a 




34 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



raouiul, 21 feet long, and al>out 4 feet liigli. which liad l)een accu- 

 mulated around the trunk of a douhle live-oak tree, Quercus 

 virens^ which stood on the side of a road. The second form was 

 located at a point distinguished as Camp Jeanes. It was on a 

 high, flat, upland prairie, and was a bed of denuded earth, in the 

 midst of tiie grassy' open, 8 feet 9 inches long, and 7 feet, more 

 or less, across. Over tliis denuded surface were scattered between 

 twenty' and tiiirty circular, semicircular, and S-shaped elevations 

 of fresh earth-pellets. The circular monndlets had the appear- 

 ance of an American spittoon, the reseml)lance being stronger by 

 reason of a round open entrance or gallery' door in the centre. All 

 had api)arently been naturall}' formed by the gradual accumula- 

 tion of the pellets of sandy soil, as they were brought out, and 

 dumped upon the circumference of the heap. The moundlets were 

 massed at the base, and graduall}^ sloped off towards the top. 

 They were from 3 to 4 inches high. This " bed" (as the natives 

 call it) was quite free from grass, as was also the mound at Camj) 

 Wright. Another I'est of the same character was found at Camp 

 JeancS ; this was situated in a grove, but was full}' exposed to 

 the sun. A fourth nest was found about a mile distant from this 

 spot, of the same character. This is, therefoi'e, probably the 

 normal form of the external architecture of the formicary, the 

 mound at Camp Wright being probably formed by accumulations 

 around the tree, caused by the bordering road, which restricted 

 the limits of the gates, and-so threw the separate raoimdlets back 

 upon each other. 



2. Gates or Doors. — His first view of the mound at Camp 

 Wright led him to fear that he had made a mistake, and pitched 

 his camp near an abandoned nest. There was not a sign of life. 

 The mound was covered over with earthen knobs or warts of 

 various sizes, but the action of a recent shower upon the black 

 soil gave the hill the appearance of an old one. Here and there 

 were scattered over the surface small irregular heaps of di'y leaves, 

 bits of leaves, and twigs. Otherwise, the mound seemed lifeless, 

 deserted. As the evening began to fall the scene was wholly 

 changed. Hosts of ants, of various sizes, and in countless num- 

 liers, were hurrying out of open gates into the neighboring 

 jungle, and two long double columns were stretched from the 

 bottom to the top of the large overhanging live oak. The ants 

 in the descending columns all carried above their heads portions 

 of green leaves, whie-h waved to and fro and glancecl in the lantern 

 liglit, giving to the moving column a weird look, as it moved 

 along, it seemed like a procession of Lilliputian Sabbath-school 

 children bearing aloft their banners. It is this habit which has 

 given this insect in some quarters the popular name of the 

 "Parasol Ant.'' It is also called in Texas the ''Brazilian Ant," 

 but is quite universally known as the '* Cutting Ant," certainly a 

 most appropriate name. 



The opening and closing of the gates occurs before and after 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 35 



every exit from tlie nest. The jirocess is a long, careful, antl 

 comi)licate(l one, and was studied fully. Towards evening tlie 

 gates are gradually thrown open, and so remain until morning, 

 when they are gradually closed, ti»e process continuing in some 

 cases until lOiA. M. The closing is done by carrying into the 

 gallery bits of dry twigs of various lengths, some as long as H 

 inch, dry leaves, and other refuse. A number of closed gates 

 were opened to note the de])lh to which this refuse was placed. 

 It varied from one-half inch to an inch and a half from the sur- 

 face. In some cases the gallery had been sealed up with sand 

 pellets below the refuse. The galleries quite often slant inward 

 from the gate, and at as great an angle as 45°. The}- also some- 

 times divide a short distance from the surHice. These conforma- 

 tions allow more readily the process of closing. In carrying in 

 the refuse the larger forms of the ant are engaged; as the liole 

 gradually closes, only the very smallest appear. The last touches 

 are carefully and delicately made by the minims, who, in small 

 squads, fill in the remaining interstices witli minute grains of sand, 

 and finally, the last laborer steals in behind some bit of leaf, and 

 the gate '\s closed. It then presents to the causual observer the 

 appearance above (lescrii)ed of a little heap of dry chips acci- 

 dentally accumulated upon the mound. The galleries at Camp 

 Jeanes were closed in the same manner. 



When the gates are opened at dusk, this process is reversed. 

 The minims first appear, deporting from the heap particles of 

 sand. Larger forms follow, carrying away bits of refuse, which 

 they drop a couple of inches more or less from tiie gate. This is 

 a slow process, and apparently little is aci-om|»lished for a long 

 time. But evidently tiie whole mass of refuse is thus loosened. 

 Then comes the final l)urst, with soldiers, majors, and minors in 

 the lead, wlio rush out bearing up before them the rubbish, which 

 flies here and there, and in a few moments is cleared away from 

 the gailer}'. and spread around the margin of the gate. Tiiese 

 chi|)s are evidently gathered together for this i>urpose, and are 

 among the " treasures'' of the ants, being kept near by for this 

 use. The pieces were easily identified as Iieing thus used several 

 days in succession. 



The above oltservation points out at least the use found for the 

 extremely small forms peculiar to this species. At least ten dis- 

 tinct castes (forms or sizes) were exhii>ited to the Academy. 

 They vary as follows, the measurements being in sixteenths of an 

 inch, viz., 9, 14 ; S, H ; soldier 7 ; worker major 6 ; minor 5; and 

 the remaining castes in the proportion, 3i, 3, 2^, 2, 1^, 1. A 

 more careful comparison may possil>l3' reduce this series one or 

 two. But the result, as above, will probably stand. 



• The gates first opened are the first closed, and those last oi>ened 

 are the last closed. 



3. Leaf-cutting Habit. — The whole process of cutting and car- 




36 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



vying leaves from trees and shi'nl)s was observed at Camp Wiiglit, 

 and at a vegetable garden near Austin. In order better to see 

 the mode of cutting, small tender branches of live-oak were 

 thrust into the mound near the gates. These were soon covered 

 with ants, and as the lantern could thus be used convenient!}', the 

 operations of the cutlers were completely in view. The cutter 

 grasps the leaf with outspread feet, and makes an incision at the 

 edoe l)y a scissors-like motion of her sickle-shaped tootlied 

 mandibles. She gradually revolves, steadily cutting as she does 

 so, her mandibles thus describing a circle, or the greater portion 

 thereof. The feet turn with the head. The cut is a clean one, 

 quite through the leaf. The cutter will sometimes drop with the 

 excision to the ground, sometimes retire when the section has 

 dropped, sometimes Ht is inferred) seize the section and carry it 

 down the tree. A division of labor was apparent. At the foot 

 of one tree was a pile of cut leaves, to which clippings were con- 

 tinually being added b}' droppings from above. Carriers on the 

 ground took these uji, and bore them to the nest. The loading 

 of tlie cuttings is thus: the i)iece is seized by the curved mandi- 

 bles, the head is elevated, the ))iece is thrown back by a quick 

 motion, seeming to be lodged on its edge within the deep furrow 

 that runs along the entire medial line of the head (except the 

 clypeus), and supi)orted between prominent spines on the edge of 

 this furrow and on the prothorax. The furrow and spines thus 

 apiK-ar to serve a very useful end. The cutting and carrying were 

 not done (so far as noted) by the smaller castes. The soldiers 

 rarely engaged in this work, but were seen to precede the excur- 

 sion columns as they moved out and up th.e tree, and afterward 

 to return, as though engaaed as scouts or pioneers. 



The principal leaves gathered at Camp Wright were those of 

 the live-oak. The young saplings in tlie neighborhood of the 

 mound were in great part or entirely defoliated. The great tree 

 above was in parts stripped to the very top. So also was some 

 wild vine unknf)wn to him. In beginning work the cutters seem 

 to aim first at the topmost leaves. A nest on the grounds of an 

 intelligent nurseryman and gardener near Austin was visited, and 

 from the i:»roprietor many facts were learned. Ants were here 

 seen at work late in the afteinoon. They had come up through 

 the garden from the formicary, three hundred I'eet distant. Tlie}' 

 prefer trees with a smooth leaf; are severe upon grapes, peaches, 

 the China tree, radishes; take celery, beets, young corn and 

 wheat, plum, pomegranate, honeysuckle, cape jessamime, crape 

 myrtle, althea. They do not like lettuce, won't take the i)aper 

 mulberry, nor figs and cedar, except the bud ends in the scant 

 days of winter. They love sugai". grain, and tobacco ! This jjro- 

 prietor assured Mr. McCook that the ants made ff>raging excur- 

 sions into his house, entered liis desk drawers, and carried away 

 a portion of his chewing tobacco before he discovered the rob- 




18T9.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PFIILADELPniA. 37 



hcry. He had to be very careful thereafter where he deposited 

 the delectable weed. Mr. McCook saw at another plantation an 

 immense column engaged in plnndering a granary of wheat, which 

 was being carried awa}'^ to the nest. 



4. Interior Architerturr The use of this leaf material, in part 



nt least, was unfolded when the work of excavation began. Two 

 trenches v/ere made, one ten feet long, five feet deep, and a second 

 at right angles to it, and wide enough to allow free entrance and 

 stud}-. The number of insects that swarmed to the defence of 

 their home is simply amazing. They were, however, not so diffi- 

 cult to manage as sometimes wlien disturlied at their night work, 

 as the swift use of the spade by the assistants and the general 

 convulsion of their emmet world quite dazed most of them. 

 However, when the S|)eaker himself entered the trench to work 

 witli trowel, knife, rule, etc.. tlie ants rallied, and attacked so 

 fiercely that the men were compelled to brush them off. The 

 wound inflicted by them was sharp, but nothing to compare with 

 the severe sting of the agricultural ant. The interior of the for- 

 micary may be briefly described as an irregular arrangement of 

 caverns communicating with the surface and with each otlier by 

 tubular galleries. These caverns or pockets were of various sizes. 

 2 feet 10 inches long and less, and 12 inches deep and 8 inches 

 high and less. Witiiin these chaml)ers were masses of a very 

 light, delicate leaf-paper wrought into what may properly be 

 called '• combs." Some of the masses were in a single hemispliere. 

 filling the central part of the cave, others were arranged in colum- 

 nar masses 2^ inelies high, in contact along the floor. Some of 

 these columns hung, like a rude honey-comb or was[) nest, from 

 roots which interlaced the chamber. The material was in some 

 cases of a gray tint, in others of a leaf-brown. It was all evi- 

 dently composed of the fibre of leaves which had been reduced to 

 this form within the nest, probai)ly li^' the joint action of the man- 

 dibles and salivary glands. On examination they proved to be 

 composed of cells of various sizes, irregular in shape, but main- 

 taining pretty constantly the hexagon, bome of the cells were 

 one-half inch in diameter, many one-fourth inch, most of them 

 one-eighth inch, and (piite ininute. Large circuhir openiivgs ran 

 into the heait of the mass. Some of the cells were one inch deep ; 

 they usually narrowed into a funnel-like cylinder. Ants in great 

 numl)er, chiefly of the small castes, were found within these cells. 

 In the first large cave opened were also great numliers of larvje. 

 The material was so fragile that it crumbled under even delicate 

 handling, but a few specimens of parts of the antcoml), with 

 entire cells, were preserved and exhibited. Reference was made 

 to the late Mr. Hell's opinion that these leaf paper masses were 

 used as a sort of "mnshroom ganlen," a minute fungus l)eing 

 |)urposely cidtivateil upon them, which the ants used for tooit. 

 Mr. McCook's specimens, when sulmiitleil to tlie microscope, ilid 




38 PROCEEDJNGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [18T9. 



indeed show tlie nppearance of such growth, which, however, is 

 only what might have been expected under such environment. 

 Tlie belief was expressed that the ants fed upon the juices of the 

 leaves. But (if investigations in progress shall succeed) it was 

 hoped that the subject of the true food of the cutting ant would 

 be hereafter solved. 



5. Tunnelled Tracks. — The ability of these emmet masons to 

 excavate A-ast halls and subterranean avenues is remarkable. 

 Several holes in the vicinity of Austin were visited, out of which 

 "beds'' or nests of ants had been dug, by an old man who used 

 to follow the business of ant killing. These holes were nearl}' as 

 large as the cellar for a small house. One such excavation, aliout 

 three miles from Austin, was 12 feet in diameter and 15 feet deep. 

 At the lowest point had been found the main cavitj', quite as 

 large as a flour barrel, in which were found many winged insects, 

 males and females, and quantities of larva?. This nest was situ- 

 ated 669 feet from a tree that stood in the front yard of a house 

 which the aui-s had stripped. Mr. McCook took the range of the 

 underground way traversed by the ants to reach this point, from 

 which an accurate route was constructed and exhibited. The 

 course varied very little from a direct line. Two branch tunnels 

 weie made to a peach orchard 120 feet distant. Reference was 

 made to a paper b}' Dr. Liucecum in the Proceedings of the 

 Academy, wliich gave an account of the tunnelling of a stream 

 by tiiese ants. There is nothing improbable in this, as the tunnel 

 above referred to went down in places as deep as 6 feet, the aver- 

 age, however, being about 18 inches. At the exit hole the tunnel 

 was 2 feet from the surface. The digging operations were de- 

 scribed, in which the small forms alone seemed to take part. The 

 large forms would therefore appear to assist in opening the gates, 

 make the excursions, and do the cutting; the small forms to do 

 the digging, or at least the carrying out of excavated earth, while 

 the minims, or least forms, assist in oi)eniug and closing doors 

 and keei)ing charge of the larvte. The minims are quite ferocious 

 in attack, and gallantly supjjort the large headed soldiers. 



6. Origin of Caslea by Evoluiion. — This wide differentiation of 

 form among the insects of one sitecies an«l nest is one of the most 

 serious special difhculties which the English evolution hypothesis 

 has encountered. Dr. Darwin, with that candor which alwa3S 

 wins him the respect and confidence of all sincere minded oppo- 

 nents, fully admits tiiis, and endeavors at some length to meet it. 

 The knot of the difficulty lies in the fact that the worker castes 

 are sterile, and are produced from eggs laid at different periods 

 by the female. fcu|jposing therefore that profitable or other modi- 

 fications had occurred in the workers, how, on the principle of 

 natural selection and hereditary transmission couhl these operate 

 upon such workers? All moditications of structure must be 

 wrought and transmitted through the female alone, effecting thus 




1S79.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 39 



the worker-life enwrapped in tlie egg. But it apiiears quite im- 

 possible to comprehend how any structural modifications cnuld 

 act from the worker ui)on the queen in order to thus react upon a 

 succeeding generation of workers. The illustrations which Dr. 

 Darwin cites,' the A-ariation of domestic cattle by interbreeding, 

 and M. Yerlot's experiments with certain double annual flowers, 

 if admitted to throw some light u))on the inquiry, yet require an 

 efficient superintending human intelligence, which cannot be sup- 

 posed to have its analogue in the perpetuati(jn and development of 

 ant forms, unless, indeed, we may believe that the evolution 

 hypothesis implies and requires the interposition of a Personal 

 Intelligence infinitely supi-rior to that of both ant and man. 



The precise sense in which the workers may be called " sterile" 

 admits of sftme question. Sir John Lubbock has recently shown 

 that i)arthenogenetic eggs are sometimes produced by worker-ants 

 in artificial forniii-aries, i'rom which males alone are hatched. This 

 is according to the analogy of other Hymeiiopiers, as for example, 

 bees and wasj)s. Here, then, there raa\' be p()ssil)le escape from 

 Dr. Darwin's difriculty more satisfactory than that which he him- 

 self suggests; for it is conceivable that an opportunity migiit tlius 

 be opened for the transmission of a profitable variation which 

 might arise in a worker. Still, the difficulty ap|)ears impassable. 

 One must suppose the growth and maturity of one such i^artiie- 

 nogenetic male, produced from a worker with such useful modifi- 

 cation, to have been contemporaneous with the maturity of the 

 females of a "swarm ;'' this male, togetiier with the males hatched 

 directly from eggs laid liy the queen shall have gone forth, as is 

 the haljit of ants, in tiie regular marriage flight, or "swarming;"' 

 and therein shall have met a virgin queen. As tlie modification 

 thus supposed to be transmitted, must, on the hypothesis, Ite very 

 minute, it could have been saved from obliteration, only by sup- 

 posing it fortified by the recurrence of other contingencies of like 

 character in succeeding generations. Mr. McCook therefore con- 

 cluded that the development Ity natural selection, according to 

 Dr. I)nrwin's hypothesis, of so many and widely varied forms as 

 exist in the cutting ant. requires a series of contingencies so 

 multiplied and remote as to forbid a reasonable hope of its jtrob- 

 able occurrence, even witli the additional favoring circumstance 

 of occasional males partlienogenetically jtroduced. 



He added that some of the points which I)r. Darwin had 

 raised as to the structure of tlie driver ant of Africa were being 

 careluUy examined by him in the case of Ada fervcns^ with the 

 best microscopic lielps at his command. Thus far, however, after 

 a quite careful examination, nothing that can suggest the i«lea of 

 an interblending of the castes by nulimentary forms had Iteen dis- 

 covered. The lowest castes of minims, in all s|)ecimen8 examined, 

 with special reference to the mouth organs and eyes, showed the

same structure, in equal definiteness and perfection, as the larger 

 castes. Allusion was also made to tlie ravages of these destructive 

 insects, and some of the modes for exterminating them were ex 

 plaineci.

On Bothriocephalus lotufi. — Prof. Leidy exhilnted specimens 

 of a tape worm, which had been submitted to him for determina- 

 tion by Dr. John T. Walker. The specimens consist of about a 

 dozen portions of what appear to have been four or five individu- 

 als, all of tiuMU unfortunatel}' without the head. The}' were dis- 

 ciiai'ged by a man, aged 28 years, formerly a farmer, a native of 

 Sweden, who came to this country aliout three months since. At 

 irregular intervals during the last five years the patient passed 

 fragments, of a few inches, of the worm. According to Dr. 

 Walker, the collective measurements of the si)eeimens presented 

 he had estimated to be upwards of 100 feet. In their contracted 

 condition, as preserved in alcoiiol, none of the mature segments 

 measured over 4 mm. in length by 10 mm. in breadth. These are 

 quite characteristic of Bothriocephalua lotus. The egg pouches 

 of the uterus centrally situated are rendered distinct fn^m the 

 ripe eggs which give to them a chocolate-brown appearance. The 

 genital apertures are in the median line, nearer the anterior bor- 

 der of the segments. In Taenia, the genital apertures are at the 

 lateral margin of the segments. 



The specimens were regarded as of special interest from the cir- 

 cumstance that they were the first of the BothriocephaluH latus, 

 that Prof. L. had had the opportunity of seeing from a person 

 living in our ccjuntrj-.

Asphnltum and Amber from Vincenttoicn, K. J. — Mr. E. Gold- 

 Smith remarked that he had received from Col. T. M. Bryan a 

 specimen of asphaltum, a mass of which, weighing aI)out a hun- 

 dred [)0unds, had been found in the ash marl, a layer above the 

 green sand proper, about 16 feet from the surface, in the neigh-

borhood of Vinconttowii. It seems that this j^eciiliar hy<li"ocai-hon 

 had not l)een oliserveil in tiie State of New Jersey before ; at least no 

 mention of it is made in the Geoh>gical Ilepf)rt8 np to 18GS. The 

 specimen presento<l to the Academy had attached on one side a 

 layer of the marl in whirli it was found. As the material in ques- 

 tion is pro[)er]y considered a mixture of various hydrocarbons, it 

 seems to be obvious tliat the properties vary according to the 

 predominance of one or the other substance contained tlierein. 

 This kind is very brittle, black, with a resinous lustre. Its frac- 

 ture is uneven, inclined to conchoidal ; the streak and powder 

 appear brown. It melts easily in the flame, like wax, and bnrns 

 with a yellow smoky flame, leaving, after burning, a voluininf)US 

 coal and l)nt little ashes. In water, alcohol, and solution of caus- 

 tic potassa, it is not soluble. It dissolves in chloroform and in 

 oil of turpentine. In ether it dissolves with difficulty, forming a 

 yellowish brown solution by transmitted and a dirty greenish so- 

 lution by reflected light. Oil of vitriol dissolves it into a black 

 liquor, which, when poured into water, shows that a part of the 

 substance is retained in solution, whilst another subsides as a dark 

 colored powder. Nitric acid reacts on the snVistance at an elevated 

 temperature, forming therewith soluble products of oxidation. 



Not far from the pit from which the asplialtnm had been ob- 

 taiiied, a specimen of yellow mineral resin was found. It occurs 

 frequently in the marl of the cretaceous formation, but not regu- 

 larly; sometimes hundreds of tons ma}' be looked over without 

 finding a single piece ; at other times enougli has been f(;un<l to 

 fill a barrel within a day. It is usually known under the name of 

 amber or suceinite. 



It ditTered in several particulars from the typical amber found 

 at the bottom and on the coast of the Ixdtic Sea. Our s])ecimeu 

 is lighter than water, whilst tlie amber from the Baltic is speeili- 

 cally heavier. The latter fuses into a thick sluggish fluid, the 

 Tincenttown amber into a very fluid mobile liquid; the cohesion 

 of the Hallic product is stronger than in the speeimen in question. 

 These differences indicate its analogy to the variety of succinite 

 called Krantzite by C. Hergeman, who reported its occurrence 

 near Nieuberg, Germany. 



It melts on heated platinum foil into a brown liquid, which 

 runs like water. It takes fire easily, and burns with a yellowish, 

 strongly smoking flame, leaving but little coal, which rapidly 

 burns :iway and leaves a small fpiantity of dark colored ashes as 

 a residue. Heated in a closed tube it melts and vapf)rizes into a 

 gray cloud, which condenses easily to an oily licpiid and some 

 small crystals, which are probal)ly siiccinic acid. 'I'lie odor of the 

 fumes is strongly penetrating, like acrolein. In water, alcohol, 

 or etiier, it seems to be but sparingly sf)lul»le. In chloroform, 

 bisulphide of carbon, and in oil of turpentine, it dissolves freely. 

 Oil of vitriol makes with it a red solution. CoM nitric aci<l seems

not to affect it much. On warming, tlie 3'ellowish powder be- 

 comes orange-red. It is partly dissolved l)y caustic potassa. In 

 this yellowish brown Krantzite, Mr. Goldsmith noticed on a fresh 

 fracture a row of white crystals arranged in radiating groups. 

 The cr^'stals were too small for mechanical separation, but the

DESCEIPTIONS OF THREE NEW SPECIES OF CALCEOLID^ FROM THE 

 UPPER SILURIAN ROCKS OF KENTUCKY. 



BY VICTOR W. LYON. 



For several Aears [>ast there liave been found in the ferruginous 

 clay and light-gray marly limestone of the Niagara period, which 

 outcrops at tiie quarries in JeHerson Count}-, Kentucky, on Bear- 

 grass Creek, one mile east of Louisville, man}' fossils, which have 

 been considered by some collectors to be a si)ecies of coral allied 

 to Zaphretiti!< 



Until November 25th, 187T, all the specimens which I found 

 were in such a slate of preservation that they could not be de- 

 termined. 



Since my attention has been called particularly to these speci- 

 mens, I have collected one hundred and seventy well-preserved 

 fossils, which I regard as true Calceolae. There are four distinct 

 species, of which three are new. 



In the same bed, associated with these new forms of Calceola, 

 are found Calceola Tenne.^seensis (Koemer) ; Orlhis elegantala, 

 0. hybrida, 0. nisis, 0. rugae plicaia ; Spirifer radiota, S. cris- 

 pus, S. roi<feUum ; Fentamerus nysuis, P. Littoni^ P. Knappi, P. 

 nucltus ; Phynchonella Solf'ordi, JR. TennesseensU^ R. neyleda ; 

 Cyrlia exporrecta ; Garyocrinus orncdus ; Eucalyptocriniis csela- 

 (us, E. craasu,< ; Eaplocrinus ovali,^, etc. The new species refer- 

 red to are as follows : — 



Genus CALCEOLA, Lamarck, ISOl. 

 Calceola cornicalam, V. W. Lyon. n. sp. 



Shell thin; valves not articulated; ventral valve horn-shaped ; 

 area high and narrow, greatly curved to the left, flat, one inch 

 along the shorter curve, from apex to hinge; hinge straigiit, four- 

 tenths inch long, at an obtuse angle to the apex. 



Draw a line from tiie centre of the hinge perpendicularly, an<l 

 it will cut the longer curve of the area midway between apex and 

 hinge.' 



' I have before nie two very perfi'ct ventral valves of C. Teiiiuiii>e< nst'a, 

 from Decatur County. Tenn., Upper Silurian. Shell triangular pyramidal, 

 area one inch from apex to hinj^e ; hinge line one inch wide. 



If a line be drawn from cardinal process to apex, it will divide the shell 




44 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1819. 



Dorsal side of ventral valve silb-semicircular, markings of 

 growth indistinct, parallel to sub-semicircular opening; dorsal 

 side of opening almost perpendicular to hinge line, or about one- 

 tenth inch nearer to the apex. 



Cardinal process or tooth central, round and smooth along its 

 summit, three-tenths inch in length, three-tenths in width, gradu- 

 alh' narrowing from the hinge backward, extending from the 

 hinge line to the inner end of cavity. 



The characters which separate this species from C. Tennps- 

 seensis, lloemer, and C. sandalinse^ Lamarck, are well marked. 

 The semicircular margin of the mouth in C. I'eniiesaeensis is 

 one-half inch from the apex; while in C. corniciilum it is nine- 

 tenths inch, or almost over the hinge line. 



Position and Locality . — A few good ventral valves have been 

 obtained from the ferruginous cla}', Niagara period, one mile east 

 of Louisville, north side of Beargrass Creek. 



Calceola Coxii,' V. W. Lyon, n. sp. 



Shell thick, triangular, valves not articulated ; ventral valve 

 P3'ramidal ; area large, flat, triangular, nine-tenths inch high, with 

 an obscure central line ; markings of growth prominent, extend- 

 ing around the shell parallel to hinge; hinge line straight crenu- 

 lated, four-tenths inch long. 



Mouth semicircular; cavity three-tenths inch deep; all around 

 the mouth, extending centrally' towards the bottom of cavity, are 

 linear rows of punctures, not so conspicuous as in those of the 

 European species, C. i^andalina. The cardinal process central, 

 prominent, short, round, and smooth along its summit. 



Dorsal valve raised slightl}', snl)-centrally toward hinge line; 

 valve composed of several thin semicircular plates, one aViove 

 another, graduall}' increasing in diameter from top to bottom; 

 area ver}- narrow. Cardinal process not seen. 



In some adult species young are seen attached to the bottom of 

 cavity; none have been found on the outside of siiell, as in C 

 aftenuatus. 



Position and Locality. — In same beds as the preceding, also in 



into two right-angle tj-iangles. The hnige is at right angles to the apex ; 

 while in C. corniculiim the hinge is at an obtuse angle.

 Cox, State Geologist of Indiana.

marly limestone of Niagara period, north side Beargrass Creek, 

 one mile east of Louisville, Jefferson County. Viy. 



I have two excellent specimens with both valves united ; also 

 ten good ventral valves of this species. 

 Calceola attennatus, V. W. Lyon, n. sp. 



Shell tliiek, attenuated, valves not articulated ; area of ventral 

 valve high and narrow, curving to the right, then to the left, then 

 to the right (some have three curves, others only two) ; area 

 straight part of the dii^tance from the aperture toward the apex, 

 then curving gradually uijward and outward (some specimens 

 have two curves upward, others one) ; area two inches high, with 

 an obscure central line; hinge three-tenths inch wide, straight. 



Markings of growth in some specimens very prominent, also 

 striae extending around the shell, parallel to the semicircular 

 opening or mouth. One of the most remarkable features of this 

 species is, that along tlie outer edge, and sometimes the central 

 line of the area, at almost each line of growth, and also in one or 

 two specimens at the mouth of the shell, are one or more pro- 

 cesses or small bodies having the appearance of foot-stalks. Some 

 of them are one-tenth inch in length, others four-tenths. At first 

 T thought these processes had served merel}' to attach the shell 

 to some permanent bod}-; but after cleaning one very large and 

 elegant specimen, I discovered these processes to be young Cal- 

 ceolae, showing all the distinct fcatuies of the older one. 



In one young ventral valve, which is attached to the second 

 line of growth of an adult, the cardinal process or tooth is perfect. 



Another most singular feature in the adult of this species is, 

 that in two places the central line of the area is lifted at the line 

 of growth, and the cardinal process is seen at each. This speci- 

 men has the appearance as if three adults had almost swallowed 

 each other, leaving only the hinge lines and tooth visible. Cardi- 

 nal process thrce-tenlhs inch long, from two to three lines wide, 

 round and smooth along its summit, gradually diminishing iu 

 width towards its end, not reaching the end of the cavity. In 

 some specimens the process is larger and longer than above indi- 

 cated, but it never reaches the bottom of the cavity as in C cor- 

 iticulum. The characters of this species are so well markeil that 

 it can be distinguished at a glance from any known species of 

 Calceola.

Posilion and Locality. — T have sixty good ventral valves from 

 tlie ferruginous clay and marly limestone of the Niagara period, 

 one mile east of Louisville, Ky., nortii side of Beargrass Creek. 



I have no doubt that the j^jung of C. attenualus and of all 

 other species of the Calceolidae became attached immediatel}' after 

 germination, to the inner surface of the rim of the mouth, and 

 remained in this position until they were large enough to support 

 themselves. Lines of growth upon these species are nothing 

 more or less than the margins of former mouths, which are almost 

 alwa3's obliterated in very old adults, but in one instance two of 

 these old mouths are seen, showing the hinge, also the central 

 cardinal process, as well as tlie new one, wiihin all of these 

 mouths, are seen young specimens of Galceola attached, having 

 the general characters of tlie adidt. In two instances one of the 

 vigorous young attached itself to the bottom of the cavity and 

 eventually killed the old one, and then took complete possession. 



I have one specimen of C. altenuatus two inches long (ventral 

 valve), three-tenths inch wide at hinge, within the cavity of which 

 stands another Galceola of the same species one and a half inch 

 long, three-tenths inch at hinge; the apex of smaller is attached 

 to the bottom of the cavity of the larger, and almost fills it ; the 

 cardinal process of larger is seen.

FURTHER NOTES ON THE MECHANICAL GENESIS OF TOOTH-FORMS. 

 BV J. A. RYDER. 



In a paper published in the Proceedings of the Academy of 

 Xatural Sciences of Pijihidelphia," in 1818, I sought to indicate 

 the modes in which the teeth of mammals were modified h}- means 

 of the movements of their jaws incident to mastication, through 

 long series of generations. 1 there reached the conclusion that 

 mechanical strains and impacts had probably been the secondary- 

 causes to which the origin of the various forms of teeth might, in 

 large measure, be attributed. The teeth were supposed to be 

 plastic, or at least slightly so, in all stages, notwithstanding their 

 extreme hardness. This view was forced upon me by facts pre- 

 sented by verteijrate paleontology, together with my observation 

 that the physiological act of mastication was progressively spe- 

 cialized, and in each case its degree of specialization was found to be 

 in correspondence witli the type of molar tooth with which it was 

 associated. In the course of my studies it seemed clear to me that 

 the tooth-modifying capacity resided in the powers of the animals 

 themselves, and the ways in whicli they were compelled^- accord- 

 ing to the kind of food i\)V which they had a preference, to exert 

 their powers. I am aware that this sort of reasoning amounts to 

 saying that an animal causes its own structures to vary in form, 

 by the natural operation of its own |X)wers in overcoming resist- 

 ances, which view, notwithstanding its seeming improbability, has 

 more in its favor than that whicli holds that chance variations, 

 which have been of benefit to individuals, have been preserved and 

 transmitted to offsi)ring and developed into organs in the course 

 of generations by the operation of the law of natural selection, the 

 importance of which I would be the last to underrate. The latter 

 view gives us no causal interi)retation for so-called spontaneous 



' "On Xho Mechanical Genesis of Tootli -Forms," pp. 4.)-S0. 



» Emphatically not wh()lly of their own wills, because the specialization 

 of organization presupposes a certain limitation in the ix)wer to make choice 

 caused l\v habits, which have become physiological characteristics, so 

 Unit tiie charge made against Laniarckianism that it throws all outside 

 power out of consideration, no matter of what character, is utterly false on 

 scientitic grounds alone. 




48 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEiMY OF [1879. 



variations, which the view here a<lvocate(l, in some cases at least, 

 atTords ; though I do not wish to be understood as saying that it 

 gives such an interpretation in a large i)roportion of instances 

 where the histor}' of the interacting modifying forces are as yet 

 perhaps imperfectly known. Natural selection is quite adequate 

 to account for the development of an organ, or part, after it has 

 made its appearance, but it leaves the initial step causally unac- 

 counted for, which, it must be confessed, is the point where the 

 Laraarckian hypothesis seeks to supply the needed differentiating 

 causes. The hap-hazard, causeless variation of organisms cannot, 

 in the nature of things, exist; it is contrary to all known prece- 

 dent as exhibited in tiie phenomena of the inorganic world. 



In studying the teeth, one is confronted by a number of large 

 series of forms which clearly demonstrate the fact that large num- 

 bers of allied species which have succeeded each other in geologi- 

 cal time bear a genealogical relation to each other. The earliest 

 forms of teeth being the simplest, the later ones seem to have been 

 derived from them by a process easily understood, if mechanically 

 interpreted. The tooth earliest develoi)ed of all, seems to have been 

 a simple hollow cone superimposed upon a nutrient papilla ; in- 

 deed the enamel and dentinal portion seems to be developed from 

 its superficial (epithelial) layers of cells which elongate as they 

 grow and crowd together, becoming columnar, whilst the excess- 

 ively hard salts of lime constituting the dentine and enamel are 

 deposited around the columnar matrix of cells or odontoblasts by 

 secretion, leaving a fine tabular cavity in the centre, from which 

 the odontoblasts retreat as their substance is crowded out b}-- the 

 formation of the hard material around them. In living teeth these 

 are always joined to the dentine fibrils, especially in those rootless 

 ones which are constantly growing and wearing away during the 

 whole life-time of the animal. It is true, as an objection to my 

 view, that the tooth is not protruded until its crown is in all re- 

 spects fully developed and hardened, but it is not improbable that 

 teeth, like bones, though apparently very hard, may be modified 

 by strains falling upon them persistently in approximately one 

 way for many hundreds of generations. The hardest substances 

 are elastic, compressible, and flexible, and I think it will hardly 

 be doubted that enamel and dentine in possessing these three 

 qualities, though manifested in an inconceivably small degree 

 under ordinary circumstances, may, when acted upon by forces

exerted and repeated millions, perhaps billions of times in the 

 course of generations, l)e ertectual in transmitting the simple pri- 

 mary form to a more com|)lex later one, as I have tried to show 

 more fully in the paper already cited. That a brittle inflexil)le 

 substance like marble, when in the form of thin, rectangular sh\bs 

 may be bent by the force of gravit}' acting upon it persistently 

 whilst lying horizontally for a long time and only supported at 

 two of its corners diagonally oppc^site each other, is proved by an 

 old marble gravestone ver}' mucii lient from this cause and now 

 belonging to the Academy. This phenomenon it seems to me is 

 no hanler to explain than the mor[)hological plii-nomena presented 

 by the teeth of mammals; for m\- part, I believe that both the 

 phenomena in question will most probably bear a similar inter- 

 pretation, 



I now propose to offer some new evidence based upon more 

 accurate observations of the mode in which herbivorous ungulates 

 crush and masticate their food. A large living male rhinoceros 

 has afforded me the opportunity to make the observations. / 

 (lidincUy xaiv this creature crush its food by sweeping the lower 

 molars of the side about to be brought into action^ from without in- 

 wards against the upper ones; meanwhile those on the other side 

 of the head were of course scarcely in contact, provided a con- 

 sideiable amount of food was being acted upon by the side in use 

 at the instant. This, I concluded, for obvious reasons, was defi- 

 nitely the mode in wliich the jaws of ungulates were used which 

 were moved in both lateral and vertical diiections in the act of 

 chewing; in other words, it seems to be the manner in which 

 chewing is effected in all anisognathous selenodont mammals, 

 which can be definitely traced to a buno<lont ancestry. 



It will be readily understood that the above ol>servations in 

 some measure modifj' the conclusions reached in my former paper, 

 in which the belief was entertained that the motion which ilid the 

 crushing was outwards instead of inwards. From facts which I 

 liave gathered, it now seems strange to me that I should have fallen 

 into tiiis misapprehension, since the true method i»romises to yield 

 even a better interpretation of the true philosopliy of tooth-modi- 

 fication by mechanical agencies than that first offered. It must, 

 however, here be stated that, in no essential particular except 

 one, do 1 aiur my foruier views. I still hold the niaii<libuhir 




50 PKOCKEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



articulations to be the principal odontomorpliic centres, as all 

 mandibular movements are regulated from them as axes. 



From the fact that the movements are from without inwards in 

 selenodonts generally, the outer series of cusps, in the advent of 

 such lateral movements, seem to be most compressed laterally 

 and their tips most deflected in an inward direction, and I shall 

 therefore consider tlie cause as acting from tlie outside instead of 

 from the inside as formerly. The paleontological evidence afforded 

 by symborodonts, where tlie selonodont or crescent-shaped cusp 

 first appears in the outer row of molar cusps, whilst the inner row 

 is still bunodont, is pretty conclusive. This singular combination 

 of cusp characters is also exhibited by Titanotherium^ Palaeosyop>i^ 

 etc. Other series of ungulates sliow the almost synchronous de- 

 velopment of the crescent-sliaped cusps in both outer and inner 

 rows, but earlier forms seem to indicate pretty unanimously that 

 the outer or buccal series are the tirst to be differentiated. In 

 Coryphodon^ figured by Cope,' is exhibited the inward flexure and 

 flattening of the exterior rows of cusps of the upper molars, in a 

 perhaps unparalleled degree. 



Tlie change of view is simply in regard to the manner in which 

 the modifying force is applied, and does not change the principle 

 involved, which assumes broadl3- that the lateral mandibular 

 movements produce lateral changes in dental forms, whilst on the 

 other hand reciprocating ones produce antero-posterior and pos- 

 tero-anterior ones. Having definitely concluded as to the direction 

 of the action of the forces, in evidence of which a great catalogue 

 of facts might be adduced, more indeed than my space and means 

 will afford, I will briefly consider that offered by the molar denti- 

 tion of Symborodon.

and fl", the apical portion 

 worn off lieing restored in 

 outline. This shows liiat 

 S has been deflected in an 

 inward direction, and indi- 

 cates that the force opera- 

 tive in causing the deflec- 

 tion has been constantly 

 active from one side, or 

 that upon which the large 

 arrow is placed pointing in 

 the direction of the doited 

 line. The total displacing 

 force exerted by the jaw 

 moving in an inward direction during the entire lifetime of 

 the animal may be supposed to be represented by this arrow, 

 plus that of its ancestry, during the existence of which the tooth 

 has been brought to its present form by the mechanical process 

 of differentiation indicated. The muscular power or crushing 

 force exerted by the mandibular muscles (the coefficient of which 

 is 104 i)ounds per square inch of section, Houghton) in an upward 

 direction indicated by the lower smaller arrow pointing upwards in 

 thedirection of theentire vertical line, would tend while the mandible 

 is moving inwards and obliquely upwards to act as a wedge upon 

 the somewliat oblique faces of the upi)er molars, forcing them out- 

 wards in tlie direction of the dotted line and arrow pointing 

 towards a. In this way the cause of the anisognathism is ac- 

 counted for, whilst it is also not to be forgotten, that the influence 

 of this peculiar combination of forces cannot be without effect in 

 producing modifications upon the crowns of the teeth from within, 

 so that in reality, modifying forces may be at work from both 

 sides.

ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE CHIMPANZEE. 

 BY n. C. CHAPMAN, M.D. 



The literature on the anatomy of tlie Chimpanzee is much more 

 extensive llian that on the Gorilla, the animal having been dis- 

 secte<l by 'Ij-son,' Traill,- Yrolik,' Schroeder Van der Kolk,' 

 AVyman,'^ Marshall,*^ RoUeston,' Wilder,'' Ilnxle}',^ Gratiolet and 

 Alix,'° Turner," Humphre}','-' Broca,'' Macalister,'* Bischoff','^ 

 Champne3's,'® and others. It may aj)pear, therefore, superfluous 

 to orter the results of my dissection of tlie female Cliimpanzee, 

 Troglodytes niger, whicli recently died at the Zoological Garden 

 of this city. In,pomparing, however, tlie accounts of the authors 

 just referred to, it becomes evident that the animals dissected by 

 them must in some instances have been different species of Chim- 

 panzees, and in others that they exhibited individual peculiarities. 

 The above accounts are, moreover, often limited to only portions 

 of tlie body. Indeed, the only elaborate modern treatises I have 

 seen are those of Vrolik and Gratiolet. The admirable mono- 

 graijli of Tyson, old as it is, may still be consulted with the greatest 

 advantage. I propose confining myself to a general account of the 

 Chimpanzee I dissected, calling attention more particularl}-^ to the 

 l)oints in which it differed from those previously described, and 

 the general resemblances and differences between it and the Gorilla 

 and Man. The si)ecimen dissected by me was a female, supposed

to lio about five years old. and measured 28^ inches fr(>m crown 

 of head to sole of the feet. The upper extremity' of riglit side 

 measured from shoulder to end of middle finger 18 in.; the lower 

 extremit}' measured from the head of the femur to the end of tiie 

 middle toe of the riglit side IG^ inches. The hand, taken from 

 the wrist to the end of tlie middle finger, measured, on the right 

 side, 5g in. The right foot, con.sidered from homologous points, 

 was 5^ inches long. As in the young Gorilla, so in tlie \oung 

 Chimpanzee, Plates IX. and X., tlie resemblance of the head to 

 that of a human being of an uncivilized race is more striking than 

 in the adult. The distinction between tlie hand and foot in the 

 Chimpanzee is not. however, so well marked as in the Gorilla — 

 the foot, superficially considere<l, resembling a hand. As we shall 

 see, liowever, tliis is only a functional differenee, the Iowit extrem- 

 it}' in the Chimpanzee terminating structurally in a foot just in 

 the same sense that a man's does, all of the apes and monkeys 

 being anatomically bimanous and bii)edous, and not quadruma- 

 nous. The hand in tlie Chimpanzee is larger than the foot. 



Cervical Reyion. — On removing the skin I noticed a well- 

 developed platysma niyoides, and so far as I could see this was 

 the only representative of the panniculus carnosus muscle of the 

 lower animals, witii tlie exception, perhaps, of a few scattered 

 fibres in the fascia of the hand corresponding to the palmaris 

 brevis of Man. The external jugular vein was quite evident. Next 

 in order came the superficial cervical plexus of nerves and the 

 sterno-eleido mastoid inn^scle. which ditlV-red from that of Man in 

 being divided into sternal and eleidal portions, the cleidal portion 

 arising a little lower than the sternal, and the insertions being 

 equally distinct. The spinal accessory nerve separates the two 

 parts of this muscle, and ditfers in this respect from the disposi- 

 tion given by A'rolik, as well as in the fact that its internal root 

 joins the pneumogastric. From this latter nerve the su[)erior and 

 inferior laryngeal nerves pass off to supjily the larynx, the inferior 

 passing around the subclavian arter}' on the right side ami the 

 aorta on the left, as in man. There was nothing particularly 

 noticeal'le in the distribution of the glosso-pharyngeal, lingual 

 branch of the .'ith, or the hypoglossal nerves, this latter wimling 

 around the external carotid artery, passing over the hyoglossus 

 muscle and under the m\loliyoid to be lost in the tongue. The 

 digastric was well developed, as also the stylo-glossus, stylo- 




54 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



hyoid, and stylo-i)liar3'n£ieus muscles. Anteriorly I noticed the 

 sterno-liyoid, sterno-thyroid, and thyro-liyoid, and the little crico- 

 thyroid .artery passing across the crico-thyroid membrane. 

 Laterally tlie omohyoid muscle was well developed. It was held 

 in jiosition by the little band of the cervical fascia, and served, 

 with the sterno-cleido mastoid muscle, to divide the neck, topo- 

 graphicall}' speaking, into the triangles. I noticed that the muscle 

 sometimes called the omo-cervicalis was well developed. This 

 muscle arises from the transverse process of the atlas, and is 

 inserted into the clavicle; it was very pro[)erly described bj' T3'Son 

 as the elevator of the clavicle. It has been found in Man as an 

 anomaly. Very human in its appearance was the disposition of 

 .the phrenic nerve lying upon the scalenus anticus muscle, and 

 coming from the 3d and 4lh cervicals. The muscle separated the 

 subclavian vein from the artery, and between it and the scalenus 

 medius the brachial [)lexus emerged. The whole cervical region 

 was strikingly human in its disjjosition, and with the exceptions 

 of the sterno-cleido mastoid muscle being divided into two, and in 

 the presence of an omo-cervicalis muscle, tiie neck of the Chim- 

 panzee would serve the surgical anatomist as material for a 

 demonstration quite as well as that of a human being. On raising 

 the clavicle the subclavius minor and coracoid ligament were 

 seen well developed; the pectoralis muscle, however, presented a 

 difference from that of Man, as it arose from the 2d and 3d ribs, 

 and was inserted into tlie head of the humerus. The axillary 

 region was very human in its api)earauce; the anterior and |)os- 

 teri(jr thoracic nerves and the intercosto-humeral were well de- 

 veloped. 



Upper Extremity. — The brachial plexus surrounding the axillary 

 artery exiiibited the outer, posterior, and inner cords, tiie outer 

 coming from the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervicals, the inner from 

 the eighth cervical and first dorsal ; the posterior cord from the 

 outer and inner ones. The plexus gave off, as in Man, the external 

 cutaneous, median, ulnar, internal cutaneous, and musculo-spiral. 

 I did not notice, however, the nerve of Wrisberg; the subscapular 

 and suprascapular nerves were found in their customary human 

 position. The dis[)Osition of the median, ulnar, and radial nerves 

 in the hand were the same as in Man. The latissimo-cond3'loideus 

 muscle was well developed, but I could see no difference in the 

 biceps, coraco-brachialis, bracliialis anticus, and triceps as com- 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHI LADELI'H I A . 55 



paivd wiili ilie same muscles in man. In the forearm the i)iona- 

 tor radii teres arose h}' two heads, the median nerve passing be- 

 tween them as in Man, whereas I found only one head in the 

 Gorilla. The palmaris longus was well develo|)ed: whereas it was 

 absent in the Gorilla I dissected. Flexor subliniis digitorum and 

 profundus were more split up thau in Man, but as a whole tliere 

 was no marked ditierence between them and those of Man. The 

 flexor longus poUicis, joined to the perforator of the index, was 

 to a certain extent differentiated from the flexor profundus digi- 

 torum, its tendon [)assed between the two heads of the flexor 

 brevis pollicis. The other muscles of the thumb and those of the 

 little finger compared favorably with those of Man; the lurabri- 

 cales were large. The supinator longus arose from the humerus 

 much higher up than in Man. The extensor ossi metacarpi pol- 

 licis terminated in two tendons; the secnndii internodii pollicis 

 was present, but tliere was no extensor primi-internodii. I found 

 this muscle, however, in the Gorilla. The extensor indicis and 

 extensor minimi digiti terminated in their respective digits singly, 

 whereas in the lower monkeys the middle linger is supplied by 

 a slip from the indicis, and the ring finger with one from tiie 

 minimi digiti in addition to the tendons of tlie extensor commu- 

 nis. According to some anatoini.-^ts the extensor indietis in the 

 Chimpanzee supplies both index and middle fingers. The Ciiim- 

 panzee seems, from the above l)rief sketch of the muscular sys- 

 tem of the u})per extremity, to be closer allied to Man than the 

 Gorilla, inasmuch as tlie pronator arises by tw(j heads and in 

 having a palmaris longus and a flexor longus pollicis, but it differs 

 from the G<jrilla and Man in that tlie extensor ossii metacarpi 

 divides into two tendons, and in there being no extensor i)riini in- 

 ternodii [xdlicis. 



Loicei- JS.iiremihj. — Traill,' in his account of the ('iiimpaiizee, 

 figures a muscle, which he called the scansorius, rising from the 

 ileum and iiiiserted into the femur. This muscle appears to me to 

 lie simply a part of the gluteus minimus. According to Vrolik- 

 Ihe tensor vagiiue femoris had lieen confounded with the so-calleil 

 scansorius by Traill, but in my specimen the former muscle was 

 very well developed, and I should not have noticed any thing par- 

 ticular al)out the gluteus had not a i)(Mtion of it l»eeii described

separiitely as tlie scaiisoriiis. The rotators of the thigli were 

 present. The adductors are five in number. The semimem- 

 branosus and semitendinosus, as in tlie Gorilla, hardly deserve 

 names characteristic of their homologues in Man, as tiiey are quite 

 muscular. The gracilis is very large. Tlie sartorius, however, 

 rather slender. There was a well developed popliteus, but no plan- 

 taris muscle. The soleus arose by the fibular head onh*. As re- 

 gards the anterior aspect of the leg, the tibialis anticus splits into 

 two tendons, the extensor longiis digitorum was present, but the 

 so-called peroneus tertius was absent. The extensor longus hallueis 

 and extensor brevis digitorum were well developed, as also the 

 peroneus longus and brevis on the fibular side of the leg. The 

 flexor accessorius was absent. The flexor brevis digitorum supplied 

 the second and third toes onl}-, the tendinous slips for the fourth 

 and fifth came from the flexor longus digitorum; whereas in the 

 Gorilla the slip for the fiftii came from the flexor longus hallueis. 

 In the Chimpanzee the slip for the fifth toe is very delicate, and, like 

 that of the Gorilla, is not perforated. There is quite an intimate 

 union between the fitires of the flexor longus hallueis and digitorum. 

 The special muscles of the minimi digiti and hallux are well devel- 

 oped, and in addition to tiie ordinary flexor brevis hallueis I noticed 

 a delicate muscular slip arising from the calcaneum in common with 

 tiie flexor brevis, which was inserted into the phalanx of the hal- 

 lueis. Its action was to flex the hallux. This little slip was also 

 seen in the otiier foot. So far as I know it has not been described 

 before in the Cliimpanzee. There was no transversus pedis. The 

 little slip, called by Prof. Huxley the abductor ossi metacarj)! 

 quinti digiti, I notieed in the left foot. There was nothing re- 

 markalile about the bloodvessels of the lower extremity, except 

 that the saphenous vein did not pass into the femoral througli the 

 saphenous opening, which was well developed in the Gorilla, and 

 the anterior tiliial artery wns very small, its place being supplied 

 by a large vessel coming fi'om the femoral at about the position of 

 the anaslomotica magna in the human being. I ventured to call 

 this vessel in the Gorilla the "long saphenous artery," as it ac- 

 com|)anied the artery and nerve of the same name to the foot in 

 that animal. The nerves did not dilfer essentially from those of 

 man. 



Alimentary Canal and Appendages. — The tongue in the Chim- 

 panzee is thieker than in man. I found the circumvallate papillre

arranged in the form of a Y, as in man, and not a T, as has been 

 found to be the case in other specimens. The parotid gland 

 was large, the duct of Stcno crossed the masseter. The submax- 

 illar}' was absolutely ver}' large. The stomach was very liuraan 

 in shape. The length of the small intestine was eight feet, that 

 of tlie large two and a half. Tjie vermiform appendix measured 

 six and a half inches. The Peyer's patches in small intestine 

 were very striking. There are no valvular conniventes. There 

 was nothing peculiar about the spleen or pancreas; in reference 

 to the liver the quailrate lobe was not well ditferentiated, and the 

 caudate lobe was thick rather than caudate. 1 noticed an inter- 

 esting fact in reference to the peritoneum : "When the great omen- 

 tum was raised the transverse colon was seen to be attaclied to its 

 under surface, as in Man ; whereas in other monkejs and the lower 

 mammals the transverse colon is quite separate from the great 

 omentum. This condition is also seen in the human foetus, but, as 

 development advances in it, the peritoneum covering the trans- 

 verse colon becomes adherent to the great omentum, and ultimatel}- 

 in Man appears as one structure. In this respect the Chimpanzee 

 agrees with Man and differs from the monkeys. I do not know 

 whether this disposition has been observed before in the Chim- 

 panzee or the other anthropoids. I suspect the same disposition 

 obtains in the Gorilla. 



Rei^piratory and Circulatory Sy^^tenxs. — As is well known, in 

 the male Chimpanzee and the other anthropoids, the ventricles of 

 the larynx are enormously dilated, these pouches extending up 

 into tlie neck, even under tlie trapezius iiiuscle and over the breast 

 into the axillae. Noticing during life that the voice of the female 

 Chimpanzee was so much weaker than her mate, I was prei)ared 

 to find these ventricular pouches verj' rudimentary, even if devel- 

 oped at all. According to some anatomists these pouches have no 

 influence upon the voice. 



The jtouches, however, extended even in the female up to the 

 hyoid bone and base of the tongue. The crico-thyroid, thyro-ar}'- 

 tenoid crico-arytenoid, lateralis and posticus, and arytenoid mus- 

 cles were well dcveloi)ed. The inferior vocal cord, or tnore jtroperly 

 vocal memltrane, was of a triangular shape, and quite distinguish- 

 able from the remaining part of the mucous membrane. The right 

 lung was divided into three lobes, the left into two, as in Man. 

 I noticed tliat tlie left carotid and left subclavian arteries came

off from a common vessel, a short innominate, differing in this 

 respect from the Gorilla and Yrolik's^ Chimpanzee, which in the 

 disposition of its great bloodvessels is like that of Man. 



Genito-urinary Organs. — Believing that the transitorj^ stages 

 through which a human being passes in utero are often perma- 

 nently' retained through life in tlj« lower animals, it appeared to 

 me that the best way of determining the question as to whether 

 the Chimpanzee bad the external and internal labia of the human 

 female was to compare my s[)ecimen with a human female foetus. 

 The opportunity of examining two negro foetuses about five mouths 

 old, presenting itself at the same time that I was dissecting the 

 Chimpanzee, I compared the generative apparatus of all three, and 

 I ani satisfied that they are morphologically essentially the same, 

 for in tlie Chimpanzee there is a well-developed clitoris, with 

 frenum and prepuce; below the frenum the internal labia are 

 undistinguishable from the external, and these latter are un- 

 developed above the clitoris. The whole appearance of the 

 uterus, vagina, and ovaries in the Chimpanzee is also similar to 

 the internal organs of the human foetus. The bladder was large, 

 and the kidnej's resembled those of man in their form, and dif- 

 fered from that of the Orang in having more than one papilla. 



The Brain. — The brain of the Chimpanzee has been described 

 by several anatomists, and figured by Tyson, Tiedmann,'^ Yrolik, 

 Schroeder van der Kolk,^ Gratiolet,* RoUeston, Marshall, Turner, 

 Bischoff, Broca, and others. As the existence of a " posterior lobe, 

 posterior cornu, and hippocampus minor" in the brain of the Chim- 

 panzee and other apes and monkeys gave rise to a memorable dis- 

 cussion some years ago, it was with great interest that I hastened, 

 as soon as possible after death (a few hours), to open the skull of 

 the Chimpanzee, and to examine the brain in situ. The brain 

 weighed 10 ounces 10 grains. I confess to my great surprise, I 

 found the cerebellum uncovered hy the cerebrum to the extent 

 shown in the illustrations, Plate XL, Figs. 1 and 2, and XII., Figs. 

 1 and 2, and remembering Prof. Huxley's criticism that" "his error 

 must become patent even to himself if he trj' to replace the brain

within the cranial chamber,"' I did so, and j-et the cerebellum re- 

 mained uncovered. Is it possible that in my j'oung female Chim- 

 j)anzee the posterior lobe had not attained its full growth, or that 

 in some Chimpanzees the posterior lobe covers the cerebellum, 

 and in others it does not? According to Prof Huxley, this is 

 the case among the Gibbons, fol* in referring to the Siamang, he 

 says: this^ " is remarkable, for the short posterior lobes of the 

 cerebrum which in this anthropomorphous ape do not overlap 

 the cerebellum, as they do in all the others." On the other hand. 

 Prof. Bischoff observes in his Beitrdge on the Hylobates, " Da- 

 gegen kann ich Flower und Huxley darin nicht beistimmen das 

 die hinteren Lappen des grossen Gehirns eine sehr bemerkens- 

 werthe Reduction gegen die der Gehirne der anderen Anthro- 

 poiden darin zeigen, dass sie das kleine Gehirn nicht mehr voUig 

 bedeckten. Bei meinem Hylobates ist das kleine Gehirn vollstand- 

 ing durch die Hinterhippen des grossen Gehirns bedeckt."' It 

 appears to me more likely that in some Gibbons the cerebellum 

 is covered, and in others not, than that such eniinent anatomists 

 as Professors Huxley, Flower, and Bischoff should be opposed in 

 reference to a mere matter of observation, and so with regard to 

 the diversity of opinion as to the cerebellum being covered by 

 the posterior lobes of the cerebrum in the Chimpanzee. 



According to Huxley, Rolleston, Marshall, Gratiolet, etc., the 

 cerebellum is covered by the cerebrum in the Chimpanzee. 



In the figures of the Chimpanzee given hj Tyson, Tiedemann, 

 Yrolik, Schroeder Yan der Kolk and Yrolik,the cerebellum is un- 

 covered by the posterior lobes of the cwebrum. Tiedemann 

 says: "The hemispheres of the brain are relatively to the spinal 

 marrow, medulla, cerebellum, etc., smaller than in man.'" Ac- 

 cording to Yrolik, the Chimpanzee brain is distinguished from 

 the human, "par uu moindre developpement des hemisplieres du 

 cerveau qui ne recouvrent tout le cervelet."* Gratiolet, in refer- 

 ring to the figures of the brain of the Chimpanzee, in Schroeder 

 Yan der Kolk's and Yn^lik's paper in the Amsterdam Yerhandelin- 

 gen fur 1849, speaks of the brain as being " profondement affaise."

olet's criticism, yet they observe in their " Note sur I'eneephale 

 de I'Orang," in the Amsterdam Yerslagen for 1862, page 7, 

 " A vrai dire, ce lobe posterieur ou occipital ne se prolonge pas 

 autant que chez I'homme ; il ne recouvre pas si bien le cervelet, du 

 moins il ne la cache pas completement surtout vers les cotes; mais 

 il n'y a rien la dedans, qui nous empeche de lui donner le nom 

 qui lui est du. Par rapport au developpement du cervelet, nous 

 ne cro3'ons pas faire une chose inutile en rappelant que, d'apres 

 les mesures que nous avons publiees en 1849, le cervelet du Chim- 

 panse et de I'Orang est proportionnellement plus grand que celui 

 de I'homme. Ccla doit avoir une certaine influence sur la maniere 

 dont il se trouve pour une partie a decouvert chez ces animaux 

 qui ont les lobes occipitaux moins dtendus que ceux de I'homme." 

 Their plate, Fig. 1, giving the brain of the Orang, shows quite 

 plainly the cerebellum partially uncovered by the cerebrum. In my 

 Chimpanzee the cerebellum was extremely well developed, as may 

 be seen from Plate XI., Fig. 2. Should future investigation show 

 that the posterior lobes of the cerebrum do not invariably over- 

 lap the cerebellum, as in the Chimpanzee dissections just referred 

 to, and in the Orang of Yrolik and Gibbon of Huxle3', it will only 

 be another instance of the truth that the lower monkeys in some 

 respects are more nearly allied to man than the Anthropoids, for 

 I have found the cerebellum entirely covered by the cerebrum in 

 the genera Macacus, Cynocephahis, Semnopithecus^ Ateles, Gebus, 

 etc. Prof. Huxley observes, " if a man cannot see a church, it is 

 preposterous to take his opinion about its altar-piece or its painted 

 windows — any one who cannot see the posterior lobe in an ape's 

 brain is not likely to give a verj' valuable opinion respecting the 

 posterior cornu or the hippocampus minor."^ Now it does not 

 follow because the cerebrum did not overlap the cerebellum in my 

 Chimpanzee that there was no posterior lobe. It is one thing to 

 state that the posterior lobe did not entirely conceal the cerebel- 

 lum, and another that the posterior lobe did not exist at all. 

 Further, when the proper section was made of the lobe the pos- 

 terior cornu of the ventricle was ver^' evident, Plate XII., Fig. 3, 

 as also the hippocampus minor, and indeed there was the emi- 

 nentia collateralis as well. It seemed to me that it was not so 

 much that the posterior lobe with its contents was undeveloped in

the Cliimpanzee as it was that the cerebellura was relatively to 

 the cerebrum very much developed, Plate XII., Fi<^. 1, 



Of late years the convolutions of the human brain have been 

 very carefully described, and compared with those of the lower 

 animals; among others, by Bischoff, Ecker, Gratiolet, Pansch, 

 and Husche. And through the development of the theory, based 

 •upon pathological, experimental, and comparative anatomical 

 facts, that, caeteris paribus, the grade of the intelligence is propor- 

 tional to the number and complexities of the gyri and sulci, the 

 comparison of the brain of an anthropoid with that of Man be- 

 comes very interesting. So far as I know, the first distinct state- 

 ment that the convolutions are most numerous in the brain of 

 Man, and that his superior intelligence is due to this, is to be found 

 in the works of Eristratus, as quoted by Galen. In 1664 Willis 

 called attention to the lower animals having convolutions, though 

 fewer than ^lan, and that certain animals, like monkeys, had more 

 of them than carnivorous ones, etc. Yicq. D'Azyr, in 1789, noticed 

 the want of symmetry in the convolutions in the brain of Man. 

 In 1794 Malacarne called especial attention to the convolution 

 known as the gyrus fornicatus. Tiedemann, in 1816, treated of the 

 development of the convolutions. While undoubtedly the anato- 

 mists just referred to may be said to have begun the study of the 

 convolutions, nevertheless it appears to me that the credit of a 

 systematic study of the folds and fissures in a group of animals, 

 the comparison of such with those of Man, and the extension of 

 such investigation to the mammalia generally, belongs to Prof. 

 Richard Owen, who in 1833 distinguished in the Felidai the folds 

 by letters and the fissures b}- figures, and what is more, named 

 them. In 1842 his views were much extended in the lectures de- 

 livered at the Royal College of Surgeons, wlien the homologous 

 convolutions were brought out strikingly- in the diagrams l)y col- 

 ors. Leaving this little historical digression, and returning to 

 the brain of the Cliimpanzee, I think it may be staled that in 

 most of the specimens examined so far all of the convolutions and 

 fissures described in the human brain can be identified. There is 

 no difficulty in recognizing the four lobes — tiie frontal, parietal, 

 occipital, and temporal, Plate XI., Fig. 1; Plate XII., Fig. 1. The 

 central lobe or island of Reil, which is very slightly convoluted, 

 is entirel}- concealed in the Chimpanzee. The frontal lobe exhi-

bits the upper, middle, and lower frontal convolutions,' separated 

 l)y the upper and lower frontal fissure, the latter passing into the 

 vertical frontal fprecentral). The central fissure ^Rolando) is 

 well marked, a little more forward in the Chimpanzee than in 

 Man, separating the anterior and posterior central convolutions. 

 The fissure of Sylvius is in such relation with the interparietal 

 and temporal fissures, that the supra-marginal and angular* 

 convolutions are identical with those of Man. The "ascending 

 branch'' of the S^'lvian fissure also passes in between the middle 

 frontal and precentral fissures as in Man. The first, second, and 

 third temporal convolutions, with the first and second temporal 

 fissures, are as distinct in the Chimpanzee as in Man, and the con- 

 tinuity of the occipital and temporal lobes through the lower 

 temporal convolutions (Sd and 4th plis de passage of Gratiolet) 

 is as unbroken in our ape as in the human being. Further, the 

 three convolutions of the occipital lobe, with its transverse occipi- 

 tal and inferior longitudinal fissures, do not present anj' very 

 marked diflerences from the homologous structure in Man. Up to 

 this point I believe I have made no statements in reference to the 

 fissures and convolutions of the brain of the Chimpanzee which 

 have not been substantially made before. There has, however, 

 been, and is still, a diversity of opinion in reference to the parts 

 of the occipital convolutions which bridge over the external per- 

 pendicular fissure, which seems to be a continuation of the internal 

 perpendicular or parieto-occipitai fissure. The convolutions which 

 I have referred to above as the upper and middle occipital convo- 

 lutions pass in Man and Ateles so insensibly into the upper parietal 

 lobule and angular convolutions respectively that apparently no 

 external perpendicular fissure exists ; the parieto-occipitai, how- 

 ever, being apparent enough. In the Ch-impanzee that I dissected, 

 the external perpendicular fissure is quite apparent, but the two 

 occipital convolutions seem to me to be present, the upper one 

 serving to partially bridge over the inner part of the external per- 

 pendicular fissure connecting the upper occipital with the upper 

 parietal lobule, the middle occipital passing into the angular con- 

 volution and bridging over the outer part of the external perpen- 

 dicular fissure; the diSerence then in the bi'ain of the Chimpan- 

 zee and Man in this respect being one essentially of degree, the

upper occipital convolution in Man being more superficial than in 

 the ape. The upper occipital convolution, according to Huxley 

 and Gratiolet, is absent in the Chimpanzee, but has been found 

 at least on one side in the specimens described b}' Rolieston, 

 Marshall, Turner, and Broca. The upper and middle occipital 

 convolutions, so far as I have been able to compare them, seem to 

 •correspond to the convolutions described under the names of 

 "Plis de passage," "Bridging," "Annectant gyri," and "Obere, 

 inuere und aussere Scheitelbogen-Windungen." The onh' other 

 peculiarit}' that I noticed in the Chimpanzee was in reference to 

 the parieto-occipital fissure of the right side, which did not reach 

 the calcarine, being separated by the " deuxieme plis du passage 

 interne" of Gratiolet, and that on both sides the calcarine fissure 

 passed into the hippocampal, so that the gyrus fornicatus did not 

 pass into the convolution of the hippocampus as in Man. In 

 this latter respect, however, Aleles Faniscus, one case of Hylo- 

 bates, and Turner's Chimpanzee agree with Man and disagree 

 with all the other monke3-s. The mesial side or the base of the 

 brain did not present an^-thing xevy different from Man, so far 

 as the}' were susceptible of examination. The nerves coming 

 from the base of the brain were, however, relatively ver}' laigo. 

 With all deference to Prof. Bischoff, I cannot agree that the 

 " Kluft zwischen der hohen Entwicklung der Grosshirnwindung 

 des Menschen und derjenigen des Orang oder der Cliim pause liisst 

 sich nicht ausfiillen durch Hinweisung auf die Kluft zwischen der 

 Entwicklung dieser Wiudungen zwischen dem Orang oder Chim- 

 pans^ und Lemur. Letztere ist ausgefiillt durch die zwischen 

 beideu liegenden Arten der Affen. Die Ausfiillung der ersteren 

 muss noch gefunden werden."' On the contrary, it appears to me 

 that on the whole the gap between the brain of the Chimpanzee and 

 Man is less than that between the Chimpanzee and the lower 

 monkeys; and, though it is not generally considered so, that tlie 

 brain of the Chimpanzee resembles that of Man quite as closel}' 

 as that of the Orang. 



liesume. — In considering the Chimpanzee in the totality' of its 

 organization, it appears to me to be as elosel}' allied to Man as 

 the Gorilla, but it must be remembered that, like it, in the absence 

 of certain muscles, etc., the Chimpanzee and Gorilla are both less 

 like Man than the lower monkeys.

Note on Opuntia proUfera^ Eng- — Mr. Thomas Meehan ex- 

 hibited specimens of proliferous fruit of this species, sent hy 

 Mr. Jackson Lewis, of San Jose, California. The fruit of three 

 years ago were still fresh and green, and tliese produced other 

 fruit immediately succeeding the last year. Mr. Meehan remarked 

 that similar cases were on record in Masters' "Teratology," and 

 in connection with this species in Brewer and Watson's " Flora of 

 California." The latter authors state that the proliferous fruit are 

 always sterile; but in cutting open twent}' from those exhibited, 

 one was found with a perfect seed. 



Mr. Meehan pointed out the value of these aluiormal growths 

 in explaining structure and function. . \\\ the succulent Cactacete 

 we speak of the small green bodies which appear and early mature 

 on tlie 3'oung growth, as tiie "leaves;" but we know from morpho- 

 logical law that the whole fruit is formed of metamorphosed pri- 

 mordial leaves, and there is no reason wh}^ the whole body of the 

 cactus might not be formed in the same wa3',and we should then, 

 perhaps, have to regard the so-called " leaves" as mere appendages. 

 At anj' rate, here is a case of what should have been fruit enduring 

 but a few months, assuming a permanent stem-character, and per- 

 forming all the functions usuall}' connected with stem. It seemed 

 scarcely to leave room for a doubt that not only the parts of the 

 inflorescence, but the whole stem-structure is but " modified leaf," 

 in text-book language. 



Again a lesson is atforded in relation to the essential difQerence 

 between growth and reproductive force. The one of course grew

out of the other, and is iu a great degree co-relative; and yet they 

 are, in a great measure, antagonistic forces, and it is as useful to 

 recognize them as such, as to note the distinction between leaf — 

 blade and ])etiole, or liber cells and wood cells. Assuming the 

 distinction between these U\o forces, we are able to express the 

 true character of this abnormal formation.. The reproductive 

 force rJ'ter influencing structure towards its especial object, had 

 been again subjected by the growth, or, more properly, vegetative 

 force, and it was thus enabled, though in an imperfect manner, to 

 continue in the line of its especial function. Of course all of 

 these distinctive powers in plants come down ultimately to vary- 

 ing phases of nutrition, and in this direction we are to look for 

 the secret whereby nature is enabled to make up the innumerable 

 forms and conditions of living things.

ON THE VARIABILITY OF SPH^RIA QUERCTJTJM, Schw. 



BY J. B. ELLIS. 



Among the Sphaeriaceous fungi of Southern New Jersey'-, no 

 species perhaps is oftener met with than Sphseria Quercuum^ 

 Schw, And perhaps, it might be added, no species is more diffi- 

 cult to define and classif3\ Fries includes it among the " Conflii- 

 entes," remarking (Elench. ii. p. 84) that manj^ species of that 

 section approach very near to the Dothideas. Berkelej', in " Gre- 

 villea," places it in 3lelogi'amma, taking that genus doubtless as 

 defined in his Outlines of British Fungology, p. 391, and by Fries 

 in Sum. Veg. Scan. p. 386. Tulasne, however, Avho had exam- 

 ined this species, did not include it his genus Melogramma (see 

 his Selecta Fungorum Carpologia, vol. ii. p. 81). 



On examining the two ganera, "llelogi^amma and Dofhidea, it 

 will be seen that there are no salient and unmistakable characters 

 by which they may be distinguished. Tulasne, 1. c, saj's of his 

 genus Melogramma^ " Perithecia globosa ex parietibus nunc e 

 parenchymate materno vix distinctis nee solubilibus, nunc contra 

 sine negotio sejungendis facta ;" a definition which will include 

 two different types of perithecia, viz., those with walls not sepa- 

 rable from the substance of the stroma, and others with walls 

 readily separable ; in the former case scarcely distinguishable 

 from Dothidea, in which genus the ascigerous nucleus is contained 

 in cavities in the stroma without any distinct perithecium. Per- 

 haps the most obvious character separating the two genera may 

 be found in the stroma which is more highly developed in 

 Dothidea; but even here species occur, Dothidea 2^e7'ispo7-ioides, 

 B. & C. for example, where the stroma is so imperfectly developed 

 as to leave the classification somewhat doubtful. Not less difficult 

 is it to refer to their proper place the various forms of Sphseria 

 Quercimm, Schw., occurring as it does now scattered and distinct, 

 and again, on the same branch, confluent and united in a stroma 

 more or less evident; now with hardl}' a trace of an ostiolum, and 

 again with a distinct cylindric beak equalling in length one-fourth 

 or one-third the height of the perithecium itself. The various 

 forms, however, all agree in having normally a subcuticular origin, 

 on the surface of the inner bark, just beneath the epidermis, which 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. fit 



is soon ruptured with man}' small openings where the perithecia 

 are scattered, or with much larger gaps where several perithecia 

 more or less distinctly confluent, are grouped together. On peel- 

 ing oft" the epidermis, the perithecia are generally left adhering to 

 the inner bark, though in some cases where the cuticle is thick and 

 tough, as in the cherry, they adhere to the inner surface of the 

 cuticle itself. 



The mycelium which spreads over and penetrates the matrix 

 consists of variously branched and anastomosing dark brown 

 septate threads which are more luxuriant in proportion as the 

 substance of the matrix is of a soft and spongy nature. This 

 mycelium assumes at length a darker shade, so that the substance 

 of the bark and the subjacent surface of the wood becomes finall\' 

 almost black. The perithecia are alwaj^s filled at first with a 

 white grumous mass which is closelj' attached to the inclosing 

 walls, and from which are slowly developed the organs of fructi- 

 fication. The mature perithecia at length become black within, 

 and the upper portion breaks awa}*, leaving the cup-shaped base 

 attached to the matrix. Having now for several years studied 

 these various forms I am satisfied that Sphseria Quercuum, Schw. 

 includes all the following so-called species, viz., Sphaeria mntila,

have examined authentic specimens, most of them in all stages of 

 growth. 



In all these different forms the character of the fructification is 

 the same, or at most there is only a slight variation in the size of 

 the asci and sporidia, so that from a microscopical examination 

 of the fruit alone it would be impossible to sa}' to which of the 

 above species any particular specimen should be referred. This 

 similarit}'^ will be readily seen on examining the figures in Gre- 

 villea illustrating the species cited. All have the same broad 

 clavate, obtuse, stipitate asci which are often subject to a kind of 

 deformity', being bent almost double. The parapiij'ses are simple 

 or sparingly branched, of a gelatinous nature, and, like the asci, 

 soon dissolved. 



The sporidia are two-ranked, mostly broad navicular, without 

 septa, hyaline or filled with granular matter mixed with oil glo- 

 bules and become at length brown. Some of the sporidia are of a 

 regularly elliptical shape; these are generall}' shorter and broader 

 while the navicular sporidia are often much longer and narrower. 

 The average size of the sporidia is about .03""' long by .013°"° 

 broad. In all the different forms the ascigerous perithecia are 

 accompanied by others producing stylospores of the Diplodia or 

 Sphsei'opsis tj'pe. (Sphsei-opsii^ Jibriseda, C & E , Grev. 5, p. 89. 

 Dijjlodia thyoidea, C. & E., Grev. 5, p. 32.) These stylospores 

 never assume the navicular form, but are always regularh' ellip- 

 tical, smaller than the ascospores, sub-hyaline and granular at first, 

 soon becoming brown. Other perithecia are filled witii minute 

 h^'aline oblong or subglobose microstylospores (spermatia) of 

 which Phoma fibriseda, C. & E., Grev. 6, p. 2, is an cxam|)le. The 

 stylosporous perithecia may generally be distinguished from the 

 others l)^' their short c^dindric ostiola, which in the ascigerous 

 perithecia are oftener nearly obsolete. 



]}y referring to the description of Sphseria eriostega in Grev. 

 6, p. 14, it will be seen that mention is there made of certain 

 brown biseptate free spores, supposed to be ascospores. These 

 brown biseptate spores are found in all the aforesaid forms ; spa- 

 ringl}^ indeed for the most part, but always present and easily 

 recognized among the generally hyaline sporidia. I have never 

 seen these peculiar spores contained in asci, though I have exam- 

 ined during the past four years probably some hundreds of speci- 

 mens. I consider them however to be true sporidia, and have 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PIIILADELPIII A. 69 



supposed that the formation of septa is 011I3' the first step in the 

 l)rocess of germination; though unfortunately I can only conjec- 

 ture this, as the sporidia which I iiave tried to cultivate on slides 

 of moistened glass have thus far refused to germinate. 



From an examination of the above notes it will be seen that, 

 disregarding the somewhat variable ostiola, the various forms 

 above noted ditfer from each other onl}' in the fact that in some 

 the perithecia are confluent and united in a partial stroma, while 

 in others the}' are scattered and without any distinct stroma. The 

 onh' question then is whether this variation alone is sutlicient to 

 constitute a specific difference? Were this variability in the vege- 

 tative character accomi)anied b}' a corresponding variation in the 

 fruit, there could be but one answer; but as has been already 

 stated, and as maybe seen by referring to the figures published in 

 Grevillea. and as I hope to show by the publication of actual 

 specimens in the North American Fungi, the fructification in all 

 these different forms is essentiall}- the same. With just as much 

 reason might a specific distinction be made between the cluster of 

 culms sprung from a single grain of wheat planted in a good soil 

 and the single culm from another grain growing in a poorer soil. 

 This same variation in an allied species, Sphseria gyrosa, Schw., 

 was not considered by Fries as by any means sufficient to war- 

 rant a specific distinction. In his Elenchus Fungorum, vol. ii. p, 

 ^^4, under .S'. gyrosa^ he sa3-s : " Erumpunt hive tuberculosa com- 

 posita e rimis corticis Quercus ; sed in ligno decorticato, eadem 

 adest omnino simplex, conferta, subconfluens, punctiforrais abs; 

 que stromate distincto ; singularis morphosis sed in hac tribu non 

 rara." 'I'hese remarks apply as accurately, at least to the form 

 on Rhus venenata, i. e., to Dothidea venenata, C. k, E., as if made 

 with reference to that particular case. If then these diHerent 

 forms are to be united, it only remains to decide whether they are 

 to be referred to the genus Sphseria or to Melogramma or Dothi- 

 dea; or whether it would be better to follow the example of some 

 of the transatlantic mycologists and create a new genus for this 

 particular case. IJut as the number of new genera, many of them 

 witli characters sufllciently obscure, is every day increasing, it 

 would seem better to avoid this latter alternative. Throwing asitle 

 next, in tliis case, the generic name of Sphseria, from which genus 

 the fungus under consideration may perhaps witli propriety be 

 excluded on account of the peculiar character of its perithecia. 




70 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [18*r9. 



there remains either Dolhidea or Melogramma to be adopted. As 

 remarked in Grevillea, vol. 5, p. 34, under Dolhidea Gerasi, C. & 

 E., that species is scarcely a good Dolhidea for " the cells often 

 approximate to perithecia; this remark applies equally well to 

 Dolhidea venenata, C. & E., and to all the other species enume- 

 rated. 



There remains the genus Melogramma^ with the characters of 

 which our fungus, at least in its confluent forms, agrees suffi- 

 ciently well; nor are the varieties in which the perithecia are 

 scattered and single properly to be excluded. The fact that with 

 age the upper portion of the perithecium falls away, leaving the 

 base attached, shows that in every case there is at least the rudi- 

 ments of a stroma to which the basal portion of the perithecium 

 is permanently attached. A careful microscopic examination re- 

 veals the presence of this rudimentary stroma, formed from the 

 condensed fibres of the mycelium at those points where the peri- 

 thecia originate. Nor yet is the form of the sporidia inconsistent 

 with the characters given by Tulasne to the sporidia of his genus 

 Melogramma, viz.: " Sporne sajpius distichse, lineari-lanceolatae 

 vel ovatai et utrinque obtusissimse, curvse rectaeve, pluriloculares 

 aut continuse, fucatse, vel pallidse." The sporidia in our fungus 

 are not ovate it is true, but the elliptical form approaches so near 

 to that shape that it hardly seems best to exclude the species on 

 that account. 



According to Tulasne, 1. c, and Fries, Elench. ii. p. 85, Sphse- 

 fia Quercuum, Sehw. is the same as Sphaeria fuliginosa, Pers., at 

 least as that species is represented in the Exsiccata of Mougeot 

 and Nestler, though Fries (1. c.) does not consider it the same as 

 the Sphseria fuliginoaa of Persoon's Synopsis. Without under- 

 taking to determine whether the Sphaeria Quercuum, Schw., is 

 really identical with the original Sphseria fuliginosa, Pers., we 

 are warranted in assuming on the aforesaid authorit}' that it is 

 at least the same as the Sphaeria fuliginosa of the Exsiccata of 

 Mougeot and Nestler, so that it will be proper to adopt '^fuligi- 

 nosa'^ as the specific name for our variable species, especially as 

 the specific name Qiiercuum, given by Schweinitz, is only appli- 

 cable to a single form. The name fuliginosa also is peculiarly 

 appropriate on account of the sooty color of the old mycelium. 

 If, then, the foregoing conclusions are correct, all the above-men- 

 tioned species should be reduced to one which it is proposed to 

 designate as Melogramma fuliginosa.

ON THE NTJDIBRANCHIATE GASTEROPOD MOLLUSCA OF THE NORTH 

 PACIFIC OCEAN, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THOSE OF ALASKA. 



BY DR. R. BERGII, COPENHAGEN. 



PART I. 



The fauna of the North Pacific in general has been hut little 

 explored. The number of the so-calleil Xuclibranchiatc Gaste- 

 ropod Mollusea found in this region up to this time is rather 

 small. But a few species have been mentioned or described, chiefly 

 by Tilesius, Eschscholtz, and Gould, and the number of forms is 

 much smaller than that which is kuown from the North Atlantic 

 in the same latitudes. There does not, however, seem to be any 

 reason for a smaller number in the Pacific than in the Atlantic. 



Mr. Dall has been engaged since 1865 in prosecuting researches 

 •in regard to the marine invertebrates of the region lying between 

 America and Asia, from latitude 50° to latitude 70= N., including 

 the coasts of Alaska, formerly Russian America, the Aleutian 

 Islands, Bering Sea and Strait, and a part of the Arctic Ocean 

 north of the strait. 



Mr. Dall kindly invited me, who during a series of years have 

 been engaged with studies upon Nudibranchiates, to examine and 

 describe the collections relating to this group ; these were received 

 in the summer of 1876. It has been necessary to include, fov 

 comparison, the results of the examination of some few Atlantic 

 species. Dall did not give particular attention to the Nudi- 

 branchs ; yet, while a comparatively small number of forms and 

 specimens have been obtained during his cruises, the number 

 is sufficient to give some idea of the character of this particular 

 fauna and to enrich our knowledge of the groups with several 

 new forms. This will be obvious from the following list:—

16. Acanthodoris pilosa (O. F. Miil- 27. Polycera jJfdlida, Bergh, n. sp.

An examination of tlie foregoing list^ first shows a quite northern 

 character of the forms examined, excepting the two species of 

 Doridse {Chromodoris) which actuall}' come from and are usuall}'. 

 characteristic of a more southern region than the others. Se- 

 condl}', the species examined agree vnth North Atlantic forms^ 

 being either identical or mere -varieties of them, or at least nearly 

 allied species." 



AEOLIDIIDiE. 



The AeolidiidBe^\\a.\Q representatives in all the seas of the world, 

 but seem, as far as can be judged from the rather meagre accounts 



> Besides Nndibranchs, there were included in the material sent also a 

 Marsenia, an Onchidiopsis, a Qasteropteron, three or lour species of Bul- 

 lidce, and a PleurobrancMis, which will be published later. 



2 According to R. E. C. Stearns a striking feature in the conchological 

 fauna of that part of the Pacific coast included in the Califoruian and Ore- 

 gonian zoological provinces, when compared with the molluscan fauna of 

 the Atlantic coast from the Arctic seas to Georgia, is the preponderance in 

 the former of those forms of molluscan life Avhich are embodied in the 

 Scutibranchiata; cf Proc. Cal. Acad. Sci., Oct. 1872, and Ann. Mag. Nat. 

 Hist., 4th ser., xii. pp. 185-186, 1873. 



3 The generic name {,Aeolus Virgil) was established by Cuvier (in the 

 Tabl. Elem. p. 388, 1798), and originally Avritten " Aeolide iAeolidia) ;" 

 on the fifth plate of the illustrations of the Leq, d'anat. comp., vol. i., it is 

 written Eolia ; later, in the Regne Auimale, he changed the denomination 

 to Eolidia, since then the name has been written Eolis, Aeolis (Lam'k, Loven,

of them, to be less abundantly tlistributed through the warm and 

 tropical regions. This seems evident from the information given 

 by A'an Hasst-lt, Kelaart, Alder and Hancock, CoUingwood and 

 Pease, as wt-ll as by Semper.' Tan Ilasselt has only three forms 

 of AeoUdiidse, Elliott (Alder and Hancock) four or five, Kelaart 

 nine. CoUingwood was rather astonished at the small numl»er of 

 species and individuals which were found on the coasts of China : 

 Formosa, Labuan, and Singapore, and which included no Jeoli- 

 diidse at all. The Pacific seems especially poor in Aeolidiidee, 

 particularly in its northern and eastern part. The exploration 

 of Alaska, under the direction of Mr. W. H. Dall, has only fur- 

 nished five or six forms of this group belonging to the genera 

 Aeolidia, Fiona, Coryjjhella, Flo.bellina, and Hermisaenda.

Hah. Oc. Pacificum (Sanborn Harbor, Xagai, Shumagin Islands, 

 Alaska Territor}-). 



Onl}- one specimen of this species was taken by Dall in July, 

 18T2, in Sanborn Harbor (Shumagin Isl.) at low water on rocky 

 bottom. 



According to Dall the color of the living animal was yellowish- 

 white ; the color of the animal preserved in ainrits was also uni- 

 formly yellowish-Tvhite. The length was about 15.0 mm., with a 

 breadth of bod}' of 9.0 and a height of 5.0 mm., the breadth of 

 the foot 5.5, the length of tiie papillee 4.5, the length of the rliino- 

 phoria and of the tentacles about 2.0 mm. 



The form of the (rather contracted) animal was nearly that of 

 the Ae. papulosa, in general and in most particulars ; the papillte 

 were set in very many oblique rows, closely crowded. 



The central nervous system showed the cerebro-visceral ganglia 

 rather elongated, the pedal ones of rounded form, more than half 

 as large as the former ; the subcerebral, the pedal, and the visceral 

 commissures as usual, the latter with tlie N. genitalis. The buc- 

 cal ganglia elongate, of nearl}' semi-oval form, the commissure

between them short, e([ualliiiii about one-sixth of the longitudinal 

 diameter of the ganglion; the gastro-oesophageal ganglia nearly 

 one-sixth of tike buccal ones in size, with one ver^- large and two 

 rather large cells, their stalk a little longer than the commissure 

 between the buccal ganglia. 



The eye has quite black pigment, and a 3'ellowish lens. The 

 otocyst is situated some distance behind tl»e eye, and is filled 

 with otoconia of the usual kind. 



The hulbuH j)harynrjeus is of the usual size, about 5.0 mm. long, 

 3.0 mm. broad, 35 mm. high ; its form is as usual. The jaws ex- 

 actly as in the t^-pical Ae. papillosa. The radula contained thir- 

 teen teeth, beside seven mature and two immature teeth in the 

 sheath, twenty-two altogether. The anterior plate was about 0.25 

 mm. broad, the posterior one aliout 0.75 mm.; yellowish horn 

 colored ; there were thirty-two denticles on the former and fort}'- 

 two on the latter. 



2. Aeolidia papillosa, var. Pacijica, PI. I. f. 1-fi. 



Colore e flavido albescens. 



Hah. Oc. Pacific septentr. (Chignik Bay, Aliaska Pen.). 



Three specimens of this form were taken by Dall on mud flats 

 at low water in Chignik Bay, Aliaska, July, 1874. 



According to Dall the color of the living animal was pale yel- 

 lowish-white. 



The alcoholic specimens were all of nearly the same size, about 

 20.0 mm. long, 7-8.0 mm. broad, and G-G.5 mm. high. The tenta- 

 cles and rhinophoria measured about 2.0 mm. in length, the papillfe 

 of the back reached 3.0 mm. in length, and the breadth of the foot 

 5.0 mm. The color was yellowish-white, the papilht a little gray- 

 isli, and generally with white points. The viscera were not visiltle 

 til rough the side walls of the body. 



The form of the animal was t3'pical, somewhat depresseil ; the 

 head rather large, the tentacles slunl and strong, stronger than 

 the rhinophoria, the eyes not visible through the wall of the back. 

 Tlie foot was rather large, somewhat pointed beiiind, the anterior 

 margin straight, with a very distinct transverse groove. The sides 

 of the body rather elevated, with the genital papilla beneath the 

 eighth and tenth row of papilla*. The back was naked in its 

 broadest part; in the much narrower side parts covered with 

 closely set olilicjue rows of papilhe. wiiich. on the hindmost jiart*

cover the back entirely. The number of rows was al)Out twent}^- 

 five to thirty-two, the foremost shorter, with about seven to nine 

 papillpe; the hindmost the shortest, with about three to four 

 papillae, the rest longer and much more oblique, with about twelve 

 to thirteen papillse. The papillfe flattened, quite as in other true 

 Aeolidise. The anus is between the outer part of two rows behind 

 the middle of the back (at about the thirteenth or fifteenth row). 

 The intestines were seen very distinctly shining through the wall 

 of the back. 



The cerebro-visceral ganglia were somewhat elongated, reniform, 

 thinner and broader in the fore part, thicker in the hindest part; 

 the pedal ones rounded, triangular, as thick as the confining part 

 of the visceral ganglia. The buccal ganglia were about one- 

 quarter of the size of the pedal ones ; the gastro-oesophageal 

 ganglia rounded, about one-quarter of the size of the buccal ones, 

 with three large cells. 



The eye was furnished Avitli black pigment and 3'ellow lens. 

 The otocysts could not be found. 



The buccal tube short, rather wide, with strong longitudinal 

 folds on the inside. The balbus pharyngeus rather short, some- 

 what compressed ; in length about 3.5 mm. by a height of 2.75, 

 and a breadth of about 2.0 ram. The form-relations for the rest 

 quite as in the Aeolidia serotina (cf. 1. c). The mandibles (fig. 1) 

 were very strong, flattened, j-ellowish, or brownish-yellow ; the 

 articulation strongly developed, on the anterior outer side some- 

 what twisted, slightl}' bilobed ; the keel on the inside {crista con- 

 necfiva) short, somewhat prominent (fig. la); the cutting blades 

 (pi'ocessiis masficatorius) rather prominent (fig. 16), the margin 

 with very fine longitudinal lines (fig. 2). The tongue rather 

 short and strong (on the under side, the end, and the upper side), 

 with 13 plates, under the nurvovir tectum radulae and further back- 

 ward in the sheath {vagina, pulpa radulse) seven developed and 

 two immature teeth ; the total number of teeth was twenty-two. 

 The plates similar in form (fig. 3, 4) to those of the two other 

 species ; light brown-3-ellowish ; on each side of the nearl\' imper- 

 ceptible median impression and prominence — in the foremost 

 plates thirteen, in the hindmost as many as seventeen lancet- 

 formed denticles ; the breadth of the foremost teeth was about 

 0.3 mm.; of the hindmost nearly 0.68 mm. 



The salivary glands were as in the typical form. 




IS79.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 7" 



Thu u3Sopliagiis, the stomach, the Ijiliary ducts, and the intestine, 

 as in other species; the stomach on each side receiving a biliary- 

 duct, and the posterior cliief duct receiving from each side three 

 strong and one to two finer ducts; the length of the intestine was 

 about 9.0 mm., with fine longitudinal folds along tiie inside. The 

 liver papillae (in the dorsal papilhe) rather nodose. The bursa 

 oudojihora in the largest papilUie measured one-seventh to one- 

 eighth of the length of tlie papilla, containing a mass of cnida?, 

 elongate-pj-riforni or statf-shaped, reaching 0.020 mm. in length 

 (fig. 6). 



The heart and renal syrinx as usual. 



The hermaphroditic gland is large and yellowish, of the usual 

 structure; in the centre of the zoospermic lobules were oogene 

 cells in peripheral nodosities. The anterior genital mass short 

 and clumsy, about 5 to 6.0 mm. long by 2.5 to 3.0 mm. broad, and 

 4 to 4.5 mm. high. The gl. mucosa and albuminifera white and 

 whitish. The vas deferens {&g. 5a) yellowish,' very long, rolled 

 up in a tight coil on the fore end of the genital mass ; the penis 

 (retracted) short, bag-shaped, about 2 mm. long, nearly filled by 

 the conical glans (fig. 5), through the whole length uf which the 

 continuation of the sperm duct could be traced. 



There was a peculiar aspect in the interior of this AeoUdia (as 

 well as in the Ae. serotina) as far as observations on alcoholic 

 specimens go, which seemed to indicate a possible specific differ- 

 ence from the typical Ae. papillosa, although the anatomical ex- 

 amination could not bring out any very reliable specific characters.

Only the bulbus pharyngeusi of this form has been found by 

 Dall in dredging at Adakh Island (Aleutians) in mud, at a 

 depth of 9-16 fathoms, in June, 1813. 



The length of the organ was 5.0 mm., Avith a height of 4.0 and 

 a breadth of 5.0 mm. ; the form short, much broader in the hind- 

 most i)art ; the radula sheath a little prominent behind the buccal 

 ganglia. The labial disk of usual oval form ;^ the greatest part of 

 the bulbus covered by the mandibles ; the m. transv. sup rather 

 large. The mandibles (fig. 7) large, nearly as long and as high 

 as the bulbus, of yellow horn-color; the articulation rather small 

 (Fig. 7fl) ; the edges of the cutting l)lades with-4 to 6 (fig. 8, 13) 

 rows of low knobs, which on the anterior margin, except in the 

 uppermost parts of the cutting blade, rise to denticles of the 

 height of 0.1 mm. The tongue rather sliort; on the upper side 

 nine rows of plates, further backwards seven rows of developed 

 and two of not quite developed teeth; the total number of rows was 

 eighteen. The teeth as usual of horn-j-ellow color, very strong ; 

 the breadth of the foremost medial ones about 0.16, of the liindmost 

 0.25 mm. The medial ones with five to seven denticles on each side 

 of the strong point (fig; 14) ; the lateral ones witli a long point, 

 and five to six denticles on the inside at the base (fig. 14 aa). 



The cerebro-visceral ganglia short, reniform, somewhat broader 

 at the anterior end ; the pedal ganglia rounded, scarcely smaller 

 than the former. The buccal ganglia are of OA^al form, about one-

Hah. Ocean, pacific, orient. (San Diego, Cal. to Puget Sound.) 



A single specimen was collected b}' Capt. Hall alive, on algfe, 

 at low water in Puget Sound, Washington Territor}^, Aug. 1873. 

 According to Cooper (1. c. p. 205) the species is found " among 

 algje, outside of San Diego Ba^^ rarely inside." According to 

 Cooper's description and a drawing kindly lent by Dall. the color 

 of the living animal is violet purple, the rhinophoria orange 

 colored, the papilljB orange-red. 



The length of the individual (most badly) conserved in spirits 

 was about 15.0 mm., with a breadth of the body of 2.0, and a height 

 of 2.5 mm.; the length of the papilloe reaching to about 4.0 mm. ; 

 the length of the tentacula about 1.5 of the rhinophoria, about 2^ 

 mm. The color rather dirty chocolate. 



The /br»i is elongated, rather compressed, the tail rather short. 

 The head rather small, the tentacula elongate, also the apparently 

 closel}' perfoliated rhinophoria. The back rather narrow; the 

 groups of papillae situated on the side parts of it, firmly affixed 

 on tlie edge of foot-stalks, whose form and number could not be 

 determined, owing to the state of the specimen; their number 

 seemed to be much greater than referred to by Cooper. The foot 

 rather narrow, the angles of the foremost margin much produced, 

 longer than the tentacula, strong; the groove in the anterior mar- 

 gin continued along the angles. 



The eyes are rather large, with black pigment.

 tlie number of plates of the tongue and the posterior continuation 

 of the radula. The median plates (PI, II. fig. 16a) with a greater 

 number of denticles, mostly with about 12-13; the lateral ones 

 witli a rather produced outer limb (fig. 166, PI. I. figs. 16, 17), 

 tlie inner edge with a rather great nnml)er of (about 25-27) fine 

 denticles. 



As fiir as could be determined, a Penis-st3'le existed, as it 

 seemed, of about the same form as in Fl. affinis (cf. 1. c. PI. XVI.

In many respects this new genus seems to agree with the Phi- 

 dianae^ as far as these are now known.- The general form of the 

 body, the rhinophoria and the tentacula are as in that genus, also 

 perhaps the disposition of the dorsal papillai. But the Hermis- 

 sendse differ in the rather produced angles of the front of the foot, 

 in the form of the teeth of the tongue, but especially in the want 

 of a hook on the penis. 



Tiie body is rather elongated, slender The rhinophoria are 

 perfoliate, the tentacula long. The dorsal pai)ilU\3 seems to be 

 arranged in oblique and transverse rows, which form several more 

 or less separated groups. The angles of the front of tlie foot are 

 rather elongated.

Hab. San Diego Bay, Gala, to Sitka, Alaska Territory. 



Of this species Dall found two living specimens at Sitka, on 

 algae at a depth of 6-10 fatlioms, Aug. 18th, 1865. 



Cooper saw "this elegant species" numerous in the San Diego 

 Bay in the winter, living among the (sea) grass and " depositing 

 its ova on any fixed object it meets with." 



According to Cooper's description and drawings kindly lent 

 me by Dall the living animal is nearly transparent, bluish-white, 

 the rhinophoria of oi)aline color, with an orange stripe between 

 them; the papillae of yellowish color with a p'Tir[jle or blood-red spot 

 near the end. Dall regards the animals, found by him, as iden- 

 tical with the species of Cooper,^ although the colors according 

 to some (4) colored sketches of Dall are rather different from 

 those mentioned by Cooper. For these sketches the color is 

 grass-green, much paler on the under side (foot), the rhinoi)horia 

 whitish, the liver-lobes purple-red shining through the papillae, 



1 "Bluish-white, pellucid, somewhat quadrangular, posteriorly wedge- 

 shaped ending in a sharp point. Foot anteriorly with two short spreading 

 appendages, laterally thin and flattened. Head short, tentacles two, long, 

 acute (the lower pair replaced by the appendages of the foot) ; two erect 

 club-sliaped appendages (dorsal tentacles) on the anterior part of the back, 

 of an opaline color, with an orange stripe between them. Branchiae in five 

 pairs of fasciculi along the upper edges of the back, each bundle of about 

 four rows, largest above, their color yellowish with a purple or blood-red 

 spot near the end. A rosy tint often visible from the string of ova shining 

 through the abdominal walls. Length one and a half inch, breadth one- 

 quarter inch (Cooper). 



2 My specimens and drawings were examined by Dr. Cooper in 18G6, 

 who referred them to his species, the types of the latter being now lost or 

 destroyed.— W. H. D. 




18T0.J NATURAL SCIENCES OF THI LADELPHI A. 83 



on tlie lateral part of the back along the papillae 3-ellow vessels 

 (hepatic ducts?) shining through the walls of the back. Accord- 

 ing to Cooper the length of the living animal reaches about one 

 and a half inch. Dall's specimens were only about seven lines in 

 length. 



The length of the individuals preserved in spirits was about 

 12. 5-13.0 mm. by a l)readth of 4-4.5, and a height of 3-4.25 mm.; 

 the length of the tentacula was about 2.5-3.0, of the rliinophoria 

 2.5 mm., that of the papillae reaching 4.0 mm.; the breadth of the 

 front part of the foot 4.0 mm.; the length of the produced angles 

 about 2 mm. The color was uniformly brownish-white ; the intes- 

 tines nowhere shining through the skiu. 



The head is rather large, the tentacles long and strong, the oral 

 aperture as usual; the rliinophoria are strong, the club with about 

 twenty to twenty -five leaves. The back is rather broad; the pa- 

 pilla set in transverse or oblique rows, that were crowded in 

 about four grou[)s. The first group of papilhe is the largest of 

 all, compressed — horse-shoe shaped, with about five to seven 

 oblique rows in the foremost and four to five in the hindmost 

 limb; the number of pa[)ilhe in the rows seemed not to surpass 

 ten or twelve. The second group had about six to seven oblique 

 rows; the number of papillae in the rows seemed not to exceed 

 eight or nine. The space between the first and second groups 

 was larger than that between the second and third, in the upper- 

 most part of the latter space is the rather prominent, goblet- 

 formed or more applanate anal papillaj; more forward and down- 

 ward was the renal pore, which in one individual was rather 

 prominent. The third group on one (right) side composed of 

 several (five to seven), on the other of fewer (three to four) 

 rows, but never \ery distinct from the fourth group, which had 

 aV)Out ten to fourteen densely set rows, which by degrees decrease 

 in size backwards and cover the whole of the rest of the side parts 

 of the back ; sometimes the rows of this fourth group stand in 

 pairs; the innermost parts of the rows are separated by xery nar- 

 row spaces.' The papilhe conical, somewhat contracted in the 

 inferior parts. The sides not low; the genital papillae in the usual 



' The state of conservation of the individuals did not permit me to ascer- 

 tain the relations of the groups and the rows with full certainty, so much 

 the more as the greater part of the papillfe had dropped off.

place (under the region between the two extremities of the first 

 group of papillae), contracted. The foot is strong, broader than 

 the back, tiie muzzle rather broad and produced into angles ante- 

 riorl}- ; their lengtli about one-third of the breadth of the foot; 

 the groove of the anterior margin is continued along the margin 

 of the angles, the tail measuring about a third of the wliole length 

 of the foot. 



The cerebro-visceral ganglia are rather short, not much larger 

 than tlie short piriform pedal ganglia. 



The buccal ganglia are rounded, connected by a commissure 

 which is a little longer than the diameter of the ganglia. The 

 gastro-oesophageal ganglia are not long-stalked and have about 

 0.18 of the size of the last mentioned, with one large and two 

 rather large cells. 



The eye has black pigment and yellowish lens. Immediatelj' 

 behind the eye is the otocyst, scarcely larger than the eye, with 

 thirty-five to fortj'-five otoconia of the usual form. The rhiuo- 

 phoria are as in related forms of Aeolidiidse. 



The bulbus pharjaigeus is shaped as usual, and is from 2.75 

 mm. to 4.5 mm. in length. The jaws (fig. 9), as conimonly 

 among the Phidianse are yellowish-horn colored. The articula- 

 tion (fig. 9a) is rather small; the cutting blades arched (fig. 96) 

 their edges with a series of about fifty strong, sharp pointed 

 denticles (fig. 10), the uppermost short (fig. 10a), by degrees in- 

 creasing in size to about the length of O.OG mm.; the hindmost 

 are serrulate (fig. 106) on the posterior margin. The accessory 

 buccal cavity behind the articulation of the jaw rather large, and 

 filled with indeterminate animal matter. 



The radula is rather long and keel-shaped, the edge nearly 

 covered with twelve to fifteen teeth; behind these are eight to 

 eleven developed and two not (pute developed; the total number 

 about twenty-five. The color of the teeth horn3'-yellowish or 

 more brownish ; the height of the oldest about 0.09, of the young- 

 est 0.16 mm.; the length of the basal part reaching 0.3 mm.; the 

 form (fig. 11, one to four) nearly as in the Goryphellse, but the 

 denticles (four to six on each side) longer and more slender and 

 (what hitherto scarcely' has been observed in any form of the 

 oroup of Aeolidiidse) the trigonal points of the teeth are finely 

 denticulated on the under margin (fig. 11, one to four). 



The oesophagus is short. The stomach has rather strong folds. 




1870 ] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. ' 85 



The intestines are rather short, with a strong longitudinal fold 

 through its first half, with many fine longitudinal folds in the 

 anal papilhp. In the digestive channel were stems of Hydroidoe 

 and diflTerent forms of Diatomaceje. 



The liver papilli\? have a rather smooth surface. The bm-sse 

 cnidopJwrse rather short, pyriform, with masses of small cnidaj 

 (fig. 12), partly of oval form and generally measnring in length 

 about 0.013 mm., partly shorter, staff-shaped, and rarely surpass- 

 ing the length of about 0.01-0 07 mm. 



The hermaphroditic gland is very large, the lobes and lobules 

 as usual; in the centre of the last were zoosperms; in the peri- 

 pheric (fig. 5) acini (which in very ditterent numbers cover the 

 central part) were oogene cells. The anterior genital mass was 

 large, 2.2 to 4 mm., with a breadth of l.'i to 2.75, and a height of 

 1.2 to .8 mm. ; the whole, in great part formed I)}- the gland, mucosa 

 et alhuminosa. 



The Spermatotheca seemed rather peculiar; it was sac-shaped, 

 rather short, and short-stalked ; the free end of the vas deferens 

 was only two or three times as long as the penis, somewhat 

 thicker in the middle, strong, continued (fig. 6a) through the 

 whole length of tlie penis. The retracted glans penis in its sheath 

 (fig. 666) which had a length of about 3.5 mm., as also the glans, 

 which was strong, short, sausage-shaped, with a round opening at 

 the end (fig. 6e). A layer of rather short sacculate glands filled 

 the end of the penis around the orifice. One of the drawings re- 

 presents the spawn of Ae. opalescens as a rather long corkscrew- 

 shaped coil of reddish hue.

A single individual of this species was taken by Dall in 1873, 

 in the open sea five hundred miles west of San Francisco, Cali- 

 fornia, feeding on Velellse. 



According to Dall the color of the living animal was blue pur- 

 ple (like Janlhina communis ; D.). 



The individual, not too well preserved in spirits, was about 

 12.0 mm. long, 5.5 high, and 6.0 mm. wide in the broadest part. 

 Tlie front of the foot was 3.75 mm. broad, tlie tentacles 1.0 mm. 

 long, the rhinophoria 1.25 mm., the papilhe of the back 2.5 mm. 

 The color (in spirits) light yellowish-brown, the viscera indis- 

 tinctl}' perceptible through the walls of the body. 



The form of the body was rather stout ;^ the head flattened, 

 rather broad, broader than tentacles,^ which are pointed and some-

what flattened. The ihinoplioria are smooth, scarcely longer than 

 the tentacles. The eyes are not visible externally. The back 

 throiiiihoiit its whole length naked on the broader middle part; 

 laterally closely set with oblique rows of papilh\3,' al)Out seven to 

 eight in each row, fewer in the fore and hindmost rows; the pa- 

 pillae conical, somewhat compressed, particularh- in the inferior 

 parts, with the usual gill-membrane along the inner edge.' The 

 anus in the usual place. The sidesof the body ratlier high, the geni- 

 tal o|)enings quite contracted. The foot in the foremost part rather 

 broad. anteriorl3' rounded ; backwards gradually narrower, the 

 margins projecting a little from the sides; the tail rather short 

 (about 1.5 mm. long), merely projecting a little behind the body. 



The central nervoiia sydem is of the usual form,'' rather flat- 

 tened ; the cerebro-visceral ganglia rounded, triangular, the pedal 

 ones a little larger, of oval form, the buccal and gastro-oesophageal 

 ganglia as usual. 



Tlie eye is as usual, with black pigment, and with a rather large 

 lens. The otocysts could not be detected. 



The oral tube (retracted) about 1.5 mm. long, rather wide. The 

 oral glands* long as usual, opening in the oral tube ; whitish. The 

 bulbils pharyngeus 3.0 mm. long, with a breadth of about 1.8 mm., 

 as formerly described.^ The mandibles also quite as in the typical 

 form." The tongue long and narrow, as in the last ;' on the under 

 side twelve, on the end two. and on the upper side twelve teeth ; 

 also in the sheath of the radula eleven developed teeth and two 

 not fully dcA'eloped plates; the number of teeth was consequently 

 thirty-nine.'^ The form of the teeth (fig. 7, 8) was as usual; on

* These glands, which have been formerly described by me as salivary, 

 cannot be so homologized, because their ducts do not pass over the com-

 foremost teeth often nine; the breadth of the foremost teeth was 

 abont 0.13, of the twelfth 0.18 mm., the Avidth amounting to 0..S7 

 mm. or less. 



True salivary glands do not exist. The ft?sophagus, the stomach, 

 the intestine and the hepatic s^-stem, as far as could be deter- 

 mined, were quite as in the typical form.^ 



The vascular system and the renal organ are as formerl}- de- 

 scribed by me.^ 



The hermaphroditic gland^ is quite as in the typical form, also 

 the hermaphroditic duct with its ampulla, and the sperraato-duct 

 with its two parts, one thicker and brownish, the other tliinner 

 and whitish. So also is the long (about 7 mm.) whip-like penis, 

 which is drawn back and bent up and clown in the thinner sheath- 

 like part. The latter showed rather strong, circular, muscular 

 belts, and had a M. retractorU attached near the neck; the con- 

 tinuation of the spermato-duct could be follow-ed through the 

 whole length of the penis to its point. The spermatoiheca forms 

 a short bag about 1.-3.0 mm. long, filled with sperma. The ante- 

 rior genital mass is rather compressed, and about 4.25 mm. in 

 length. 



DENDRONOTIDiE. 



The Dendronotidae form, like the Scyllseidse and Borndlidse* 

 in certain respects a connecting link between the large group of 

 Aeolidiidse and the still larger group of Dorididse. In those 

 families the liver forms, as in the Dorididse^ a large compact mass, 

 but branches are given off from the same, that penetrate (as very 

 much reduced hepatic lobules) the dorsal appendages, which in 

 this way become homologous with the papillse of the Aeolidiidse. 

 In most other respects these groups agree with the Aeolidiidse^ 

 especially in the nature of the bulbus with its strongly develoi)ed 

 mandibles, and in the presence of only one spermatoiheca.

The Dendi-onotidse differ externally very (li.stinctlv from the 

 Scyllseidae and Bornellidae, especially in the form of the dorsal 

 papilhv ; in the anatomical relations of the form of the mandi- 

 IniltB and by the character of the gl. hermaphrodiaiaca, whicli is 

 not (as in the Dorididae) separate from, but connected with the 

 liver. 



Only two generic forms of the family have hitherto been known.

DENDRONOTUS, A. and H. 



The true Dendronoti differ from the Campa.<pse hy the much 

 more composite form of the frontal appendices, of the appendices 

 of the margin of the sheath of rhinophoria, and of the dorsal 

 papilhie. Tlie lateral teeth of the tongue of the former especially

The form resembled tliat of tlie typical species, the veil had two 

 median arbusculi, and on each side three lateral ones, the median 

 little larger tlian the laterals ; between the median a small, simple, 

 rather prominent papilla. A similar papilla seemed to exist be- 

 tv,een the two lateral arluisculi. XJnder the A^eil, on the upper lips 

 of the simple muzzle were a series of small, simple, truncate ])a- 

 pilhe ; the most lateral one larger (representing tlie tentacle??).' 

 Tlie sheath of the iliinophoria high ; above this was the usual 

 larger branched appendage, divided at the top into five nearh' 

 similar appendages ; the club not large, with about twent\' rather 

 thin, and ver3' broad leaves (on each side) most!}' alternating in 

 breadth.^ The bod}- of the t3'pical form had the arborescent pa- 

 pillae, as in the tj'pical species; the two foremost pairs seemed 

 more branched and more divaricate, between them (in the region of 

 the heart) lower arborescent tufts.^ Between the first and second 

 l)apillaj of the right side was the large truncate anal prominence,* 

 and at its root in front the very fine renal pore. The sides of the 

 body were rather high ; the genital opening in the usual place in 

 front of tl>e region of the first (dorsal) papilla, with two fine aper- 

 tures. The foot was rather narrow, scarcely divided from the 

 sides of the body ; the front end rounded, a groove between this 

 and the under part of the mantle. 



The cerebro-visceral ganglia were nearly as figured b}^ Alder 

 and Hancock (1. c, fig. 9), the cerebral part a little larger than the 

 visceral ; the pedal ganglia more rounded, and the commissure 

 between them longer. The olfactory ganglia in the root of the 

 clul) of the rhinophoria were nearl}' spherical, rather large. The 

 buccal ganglia were "of oval form, the commissure between them

2 Alder and Hancock mention in the B. arborescens "five or six large 

 plates and intermediate smaller ones." Meyer and Moebius (1. c, p. 43) 

 indicate twelve leaves. The number is still greater, reaching up to about 

 thirty.

 Avere all left intact, but the walls of the body failed from behind the second 

 papilla.

a little shorter than the longest diameter of th.e ganglia ; the cjan- 

 glia gaslro-cc>>ophagalia in size were about one-eiglitli of tlie last, 

 rounded, with a very large cell and several smaller ones. The 

 commissures, as in the D. arhore>icens.^ 



The eye was as usual, the pigment black.' The otocyst of the 

 diameter of about 0.1 mm., crowded witii otoconia of verv (from 

 about 0.004-0.0255 mm.) varying size. The leaves of the club of 

 the rhinophoria without spicula, and also the skin of the body, 

 which is easilj' detached from the subcutaneous muscular laver; 

 on the dorsal papillae especially, were masses of small yellowish 

 sac-shaped glands containing fatty matter. The anal tube was 

 short and wide, with longitudinal folds; the bulbu^ pharyngem 

 formed as in the typical species, 5.0 mm. long, 3.0 high, and 3.0 mm. 

 broad. The insertion of the oesophagus was before the middle of 

 the upper side. The labial disk 'or ring strong, radiately furrowed, 

 of deep brown color internally; this inner portion formed a narrow 

 prehensile collar, composed of rather irregular closely and ob- 

 liquely set erect (fig. 18-20) spines, somewhat like those of the 

 labial plates in so many Dorididse, of dirty light yellpwish-brown 

 color/ and about 4, mm. in height. 



The mandibles were yellowish-horn color, except that the arti- 

 culation was very dark-brown ; the form was exactly as in the typi- 

 cal* and in the following species (cf. PI. III. fig. 2-3). 



The processus masticatoy^ius was rather short (fig. 7fl), with a 

 single series of small denticles exactly as in the D. arborescens 

 (PI. II. fig. 13 ; PI. I Y. fig. 1); the cavities behind the articulation 

 of the mandibles were rather large (PI. III. fig. 3). The tongue 

 exactly as in the typical and in the next species (cf. PI. II. fig. 9, 

 10); the tectum (fig. 9a) radalse much extended forwards, and 

 the superior (fig. lOo) part of the rasp therefore very short; the 



' The visceral commissure has not hitherto been seen even by Ilicring 

 (1. c, p. 17G) ; it is the foremost of the commissures, rather tliiu, the X. 

 genitalis very distinct. 



2 In the Dendron. arborescens the end of the n. opticus is sometimes black. 



2 A similar somewhat broader collar was found in the larger specimens of 

 D. arborescens, but whitish like the rest of the labial disk, the spines (PI. 

 IV. tig. 2) were in more numerous rows (they hardly exceeded twenty in 

 D. piirpureus), and were light yellowish and longer. In two smaller indi- 

 viduals no trace of the collar could be found.

rasp-sheath \evy .obliquely descending between the muscular 

 masses of the tongue, and appearing on the lowest part of the 

 back side of the bulbus 2'>^aryngeuR (fig. 10c). The rachis (fig. 

 9&) with nineteen rows of teeth on the anterior margin, and with 

 one on tlie superior ; besides three loose median teeth laying in 

 the pocket on the inferior end of the tougue ; in the sheath twenty- 

 two developed rows and two undeveloped, the total number of 

 rows was thus fort3'-four. The color of the median teeth horn- 

 yellow. that of the lateral much brighter yellowish; the breadth of 

 the eldest median teeth about 0.16 mm., of the eighth about 0.18, 

 and of the latest developed 0.20 mm. The form of the teeth ex- 

 actl}' as in the D. ai^borescens (cf. PI. II. fig. 14). The median 

 ones (fig. 8-10) with a verj^ fine deuticulation on the margin, much 

 finer than in the t3'pical species, and not reaching so far (cf. PI. II. 

 fig. 14, and PI. III. fig. 10) out toward the point. The lateral plates 

 number also about fourteen, of typical form ; the first sometimes 

 with traces of a slight serrulation on the inside of the hook, the 

 following mostly with about five to six (sometimes even seven to 

 nine) sharp denticles on the outside (fig. 11); in the three to four 

 (rarely five) external plates the free hook disappearing more and 

 more together with the denticles ; the outermost, or the two outer- 

 most, were very thin^ (PI. III. fig. 5). Variations in the form of the 

 lateral teeth, and coalescence of two teeth were often observed, 

 quite as in the t^'pical species (cf. PI. III. fig. la). 



1 According to A.lder and Hancock (1. c.) the number of rows of teeth in 

 the D. arborescens is about forty, with nine lateral teeth on each side. 

 Meyer and Moebius mention (1. c. p. 44) a " Radula," with forty-four rows 

 (by which is probably meant the total nnpiber of rows on the rhachis and 

 in the sheath), and with ten lateral teeth, and the same number of lateral 

 teeth has been indicated by Loven. In my former examination (of two 

 individuals) I saw sixteen to twenty -two rows on the rhachis and twenty- 

 five to twenty-seven in the sheath, or a total number of forty -one to forty- 

 nine rows, with ten to thirteen lateral teeth. In ray present examination 

 of five specimens of B. arhorescens (like the former, all from the Greenland 

 coast at Jacobshavn, etc.) I find the number of rows on the rhachis varying 

 in small individuals from thirteen to eighteen, and those in the sheath from 

 sixteen to twenty-three, the total number thus varying between twenty -nine 

 and forty -one ; in three large individuals, having a length of 35.0 mm., the 

 number was 13 + 20 (33), 16 -f- 20 (36), and 22 + 26 (48) ; the number of 

 lateral teeth being eleven in the former and thirteen in the latter. In all 

 specimens two or three median teeth were found loose at the under side of 

 the root of the tongue. 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 93 



The salivary glands were very long, accompanying the eso- 

 phagus (cf. PI. III. fig. 12a) and extending farther backwards; 

 the duct was also rather long (fig. 126). 



The oesophagus, stomach, and intestine were as in the typical 

 species. The liver, perhaps in consequence of occasional contrac- 

 tion cf the animal, much thinner anteriorly, much tliicker poste- 

 riori}', and of a more grayish color. 



The heart was as usual. The renal syrinx nearly equalled the 

 ventricle of the heart in size. The renal organ, as far as could be 

 determined, was as in the Aeolidiidae. The hermaphroditic gland 

 almost as in the typical species^ covering the back of the liver 

 from the anterior end of this organ (or nearly reaching the ante- 

 rior genital mass) to a point between the last pair of branches for 

 the dorsal papillse. The gland forms a rather thick laj'er, which 

 is a little narrower than the liver, and fills the longitudinal median 

 groove in the upper side of it. It is of a slate gra}' color, owing 

 to the peculiar pigment of the single glands ; is composed of a 

 mass of rather large, rounded, isolated, but (from reciprocal pres- 

 sure) often subangulated glands (cf. PI. II. fig. 15). 



Neither developed zoosperms nor large oogene cells were found 

 in the glands of the individual examined. The anterior genital 

 mass was whitish and 3'ellowish: and, as far as could be deter- 

 mined, quite as in the Dendr. arbore^cens ; a very large part of 

 the whole mass was formed by the long penis, which still seemed 

 somewhat shorter than it usuall}- is"^ in the tj'pical species (cf PI. 

 IV. fig. 4). 



This form might, perhaps, prove to be identical with the form 

 of Dendronolus " with the tips of the branchial tufls white," 

 fished by Couthouy (U. S. Explor. Exped. Moll., 1852, p. 311), in 

 Puget Sound ; or even to agree witli the D. iris of Cooper (1. c). 

 Under the circumstances, the form described above must very 

 likel}- be I'egarded as a new species, not even identical with the 

 nearl}' red Tritonia jjulchella of A. and H. (Ann. Mag. Xat. Hist, 

 iv. 1842, p. 33), which, like all the forms of Z>. arborescens is still 

 dotted with yellow (cf. A. and H., Monogr., Part I., 1845, fam. 3, 



' The representation by Alder and Hancock (1. c, PI. II. fi.!;. ly) is iucor-

 least to be very contractile.

In dredging on rocky bottom at a depth of thirty-five fathoms 

 in the Arctic Ocean, Bering Strait, Angiist, 1855, Dr. Wm. 

 Stimpson obtained the hulbus phcwyngeus of a mollnsk, which 

 proves to be a Dendronotus. 



The size of the bnllnis was nncommonly large, the length being 

 abont 10.5, the breadth 7.0, and the height al)out 6.0 mm. Its 

 Ibrm and that of the mandibles (fig, 2-4) resembled that of the 

 same parts in D. arboresceus and D. purjmreus.^ but of somewhat 

 darker color, the edge of the cutting blade (fig. 2(?, 8c, 4) differ- 

 ing a little from that of the other species, and the serrulation of 

 the denticles being more distinct than in them. The tongue (PI, 

 II. fig, 9, 10) as in the other species. There were on the rhachis 

 twenty-four rows of teeth, in the sheath tweut3'-five developed and 

 two not quite developed rows, the total number of rows amounting 

 to fifty-one. The median teeth were of very dark, nearly black- 

 brown color, reaching a breadth of 0.3 mm., without any trace 

 of serrulation of the margin (fig. 11, 126), The lateral teeth 

 (fig. 5) number fourteen, rarely fifteen, quite as in the other spe- 

 cies, the four to five outermost also without denticnlations (fig. 

 21a, fig. 5a). 



The bulbus clearly belonged to a Dendronotus different from the 

 two former species, Tlie Dendron. arborescens has the cutting 

 edge of the median teeth very distinctly serrulated, and to the 

 very point of the teeth ; this serrulation is much weaker in the D. 

 purpm^eus and shorter, but it disappears entirely in the D. Dalli., 

 which, moreover, is distinguished by a somewhat peculiar form of 

 the cutting edge of the mandibles. As the length of the bulbus 

 pharyngeus in specimens of D. arborescens^ preserved in spirits, 

 commonl}^ is about one-tenth of the length of the whole body (cf. 

 my former paper) the D. Dalli is likely' to reach the veiy notable 

 length of about 100.0 mm.

TRITONIIDiE. 



The genus Trilonia was established by Ciivier as earl}' as 1T08, 

 but may have been at first' hardly separable from the forms suljse- 

 quently named Dendronotus, A and 11. 



Cuvier gave no type of the genus. Lamarck soon afterward 

 (1801) adopted the name of Cuvier,- but used as example the 

 Doris claDigera of Miiller, which has since l)ecorae the t3'pe of the 

 genus Triopa. Thus the genus must really take date from the 

 later anatomical publication of Cuvier in 1802.^ The genus is not 

 properly characterized here, and contains tlieZ). clavigera {^=Tri- 

 opa), the D. cervina (::=Dfnib'onoias)^the D.coronala (^^Doto), the 

 Z>. arborescens {=Dendronolu.-i)^ and the D. frondosa (=Tritonia 

 Homhergi)^ besides a form which Cuvier regarded as probably 

 new, tiie 'Tritonia Hombergi^ which he seems to establish as the 

 type of the genus, especially in the first edition of tiie Rogue 

 Aniraale,*and this has since been regarded as the typical form by 

 all later authors. 



Except that some new species of the genus were desciibed, 

 nearly nothing since Cuvier was known of these animals until 

 t!ie anatomical examination of the Trit. lelhydea^ by Delle Chiaje, 

 1824,^ and especially until the excellent imblications of Alder and 

 Hancock in 1855." 



The genus has by ditTerent authors been classed with other genera 

 in ditlerent ways; as a famil}' Tritoniacea (Menke, l^hilippi, Foi'bes, 

 andLoven); T/'i/onia? (Fer., Hang) ; 2V-i7onm(/a3 (Johnston); 'IVi- 

 tunidse (d'Orb.) ; but all the arrangements have been quite unna- 

 tural. Alder and Hancock first (1855) forn)ed a natural group of 

 Trifoniadiie,'^ only including the genus Trilonia^ and this family 

 was soon after (185T) adopted by Gray."*

Heparnon ramificatum. Spermatotheca unica. Penis elongatus, 

 inermis. 



The body of the Trifoniidse is rather stout and strong, some- 

 what elongated, subquadrilateral. A large frontal veil covers the 

 head ; it is simple or more or Jess bilobed, the margin with more 

 or less numerous, rather short, digitations. The sheaths of the 

 rhinophoria erect, tubulous, with revoluted margin ; their stalks 

 cylindrical, the club oblique above, with bipinnate plumes on the 

 margin. Tiie gills are rather numerous, unequal, subpetiolate 

 arborescent, inserted one behind the other upon the somewhat 

 prominent pallial margin. The anus is before the middle of the 

 right side, the hulbu$ phai^yngeus very large and strong. The 

 mandibles are very strong, elongated, the anterior extremity (arti- 

 culation) arched upwards. The interior cutting edge coarsely 

 serrated. The radula broad, with many series of plates, the series 

 with man}' plates. The rhachidian tooth broad or more elongate 

 subpyramidal ; with a somewhat similar, l)ut more elongated, 

 lateral on each side. The remaining laterals (uncini) hook-shaped, 

 the hook with smooth or denticulated margin. The liver is as in 

 the Dorididae, quite without ramifications. As in the former 

 groups a single spermatotheca (the sperraato-cysts^ wanting). 

 The penis elongate, somewhat flageliiform, unarmed. 



The Tritoniidse form a connecting link between the large group 



' I have used this name for the secoudarj' spermatotheca of the Dorididm. 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 97 



of Xi(dib7'anchiata with a ramified liver, and those with a simjjle 

 liver embracing the Dorididae and the Poroslomata^ {Doriopaidae:^ 

 Phyllidiidse). 



As in the Dorididae thcve is only one Kpeinnatotheca ; but in the 

 general form of the body, and in the nature of the pharyngeal 

 bull)us they show more afllnity to the Porosfomala. 



The family seems to include but one genus, the proper Triloniae ; 

 two other established genera, the Gandiella of Gray (Fig. Moll. 

 An. iv. 1850, p. lOfi). with 7V. plebeia as type, and the Nemo- 

 cephala of A. Costa (Atti della R. Acad, delle Sci. di Xapoli, iii. 

 No. 19, 1869) with the new (?) species {N. marmorala, C.) as type- 

 very likely merge in the typical genus, at least the characters 

 given by these authors do not raise these forms to new generic 

 rank. 



The animals belonging to this group are all slow, sluggish, and 

 voracious. The spawn of the northern European species has been 

 made known by Dalzell, Alder, and Hancock ; of the develop- 

 mental history- nothing is hitherto known. 



This group seems not to belong to the tropical seas. A small 

 series of species has been pul)lished from the eastern part of the 

 Atlantic (wliile only one is yet known (?) from the western), from 

 the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and the northern part of the 

 Pacific.

Hah. M. Pacific, septentr. ([nsiihe Kurihie, Aleutiaiine). 



This species was detected l)y Pallas, and described (1. c.) among 

 his ''marina varia nova et rariora;" and immediately aftei'wards 

 was inserted bj^ Gmelin in his undigested genus DorU ; it seems 

 not to have been mentioned since that time, nor recognized by 

 any of the different explorers of the Pacific.- 



Pallas got the animal from the K^tril Islands, "where the inha- 

 bitants eat it, raw or cooked, and where it is known by the name 

 of Tochni." He says nothing about the colors of the animal, only 



' On account of the rarity of the work cited (kindly given to me by Prof. 

 A. Costa, of Naples, the son of the author) this species has only been men- 

 tioned by Gray, Guide, i. p. 218. 



^ Cuvier (1. c. p. 4) mentions the possibility of this species of Pallas 

 being a Tritonia.

remarking that they are found hirger than the figure he gives, 

 which has a length of seven to eight centimetres. 



Of this curious form only one specimen was found by Dall at 

 Unalashka, on a reef at low water (in April, 1872). The color of 

 the living animal is noted as having been " ashy gray." 



The color of the animal, p7'eseroed in spiriU, was uniformly 

 light gray-vellowish; on the pinna? of the plumes of the rhino- 

 phoria, but especially on the envelope of the papillje of the clul> 

 of these, were remains of a silverish-white, which is also seen on 

 the lobes of the anus and the renal orifice. The length of the 

 bod}' was about 75.0 by a breadth of 37.5, and a height of 2G.0 mm. 

 In general the form of the animal was somewhat as in tlic typical 

 Tritonia. rather stout; the anterior part of the body hardly nar- 

 rower than the median, the posterior somewhat constricted. The 

 back was a little convex, sloping backwards, rather smooth or 

 ver}' minutely granulated, feeling a little rough to the touch ; on 

 the edge finely' tnberculated.' The edge projecting about 6 mm.; 

 thinner towards the border, which is finely- and irregularly toothed, 

 but showed (PI. III. fig. 14) few traces of gills;- on the left side 

 the margin is continued to the (left) rhinophorium, on the right 

 it did not reach quite to the region of the genital openings; back- 

 wards it grew narrower and thinner, over the tail it was nearly 2 

 mm. broad. The rhinophoria are ratiier distant from each other, 

 almost entirely as in the Tr. Homhergi ; the apertures of the pro- 

 minent sheaths oval, with a diameter of about 6 mm., witii the 

 border undulated, and involuted. The stalk of the club low ^ the 

 club itself c\dindrical, about 3.75-4.0 mm. high ; the central part of 

 the club much lower, oblique; in the periphery the club is divided 

 in several (about ten) larger, commonly l>i- or tripinnate plumes, 

 which sometimes are again divided into a medial with a lateral 

 one on each side ; between these stand sometimes one or two 

 smaller and single plumes; the foremost is the lowest; the hind- 

 most of all the i)lume3 is the largest, and the stem of this is 

 produced in a thick pa[)illa projecting over all the i>lunies; from 



• Pallas mentions the back as more unequal (" irrandinoso-iniffiuala'"). 



* Very likely the gills were rubbed olf ; on the other hand, Pallas, too, 

 docs neither mention nor in bis figure represent gills, he onl\- says that 

 the back side has "anguli carunculato hiulci." (The animal wlien fresh 

 showed no traces of any gills to the casual observer, and had not been 

 subjected to rough handling. — Dai.l.)

the base of this papilla three to five low septula diverge, divide 

 and go to the base of the plumes and their broad rhachides.^ The 

 veil entire (not bilobed) ; with the upper border (about 8 mm.) and 

 the corners (about 10 mm.) freely projecting (fig, 13); it is (36 

 mm.) broad and (16 mm.) high; on the front side regularly fur- 

 rowed by fine reticulated lines, which produce the appearance of 

 a serpent's skin (PI. I Y. fig. 5) ; the upper edge of the veil is 

 smooth or showing onl^^ traces of dentition ;^ there is no trace of 

 the grooved fold on each side at the base of the veil found in the 

 Tr. Hombergi; the end of the muzzle beneath the middle of the 

 veil is contracted. The sides of the body somewhat high and con- 

 vex, a little lower in the anterior part; decreasing in height from 

 the region of the anus backward. The upper genital opening was 

 entirely filled by the flagelliform penis (PI. III. f. ISd) which was 

 about 20.0 mm. long, with a diameter at the base of 3.0, and at 

 the tip of 0.5 ram. The larger mucous gland (fig. 13) was below 

 this opening. Behind the middle of the body is the crateriform 

 anal papilla projecting about 3 mm., in the orifice of which are 

 strongly projecting folds (PI. III. fig. 15a) before which is the 

 renal opening also provided with internal folds (fig. 156). Tlie 

 foot is as long as the back, rounded in front, with a marginal 

 groove which extends be3'ond the region of the genital orifices ; 

 the foot projects laterally some 3-4.0 mm. from the bod}'. The 

 tail is short, hardlj" 3.0 mm. long. 



The peritoneum is colorless, the viscera not in the best preser- 

 vation in the specimen examined. 



The central nervous system closely resembles that of the Tri- 

 tonia Hombergi,^ the limits of the two compartments of the cerebro- 

 visceral ganglia are more pronounced than in the Tr. Hombergi ; 



' The representation of the rhinophoria of Trit. Hombergi, by Alder and 

 Hanc. (1. c. part vii. 18oo, fam. 2, pi. 2, fig. 2) is too simple. 



2 Pallas mentions and represents the veil as "lacero-dentatum." 



3 The representation given by Alder and Eancock, as well as that of 

 Ihering (Vergl. Anat. der Nervens. und Phylog. d. Moll., p. 174, Taf. II. 

 f. 6) are nearly correct, at least in the essential characters ; the short com- 

 missure between the cerebro-visceral and the pedal ganglia is of course 

 double, as seen by Ihering, and perhaps also represented by Alder and 

 Hancock, on the left side ; in the hinder part of the left Tisceral and pedal 

 ganglion is a small ganglion communicating with the visceral one ; the 

 gastro-cesophageal ganglia are shorter-stalked than represented by A. 

 and H. 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 101 



the buccal ganglia (PI. IV. fig. 6) are rather large, of oval out- 

 line; the gastro-cesophageal rather short-stalked, ovoid, with three 

 large cells (fig. Oa). 



The e3'es are as nsual.^ The otocysts about 0.2 mm. in dia- 

 meter contain about sixt}' round or oval otoconia^ reaching from 

 0.025 mm. rarely to 0.04 mm. in diameter, many of them marked 

 with a few fine concentric lines.- The skin is almost free from 

 spiculae, they are almost entirely absent from the interstitial con- 

 nective tissue. 



The oral tube is rather short, about 6.0 mm. long, wide, with 

 the usual longitudinal folds. The bulbus pharyngeus is strong, 

 about 10.0 mm. long by 14.0 mm. broad and high. The form is 

 in general shorter and stouter than in tlie typical Trilonia. The 

 "muscle-plate" on the front side as in Tr. Homhergi.^ 



The jaws (PI. IV. fig. 7) shorter, broader, and higher than in 

 the Tr. Hombergi ; the length of the united jaws was 12. the 



■ The eyes in Tr. Honibergi show black pigment and a j'ellow lens, they 

 are abont 0.28 mm. in diameter. The nervus opticus is about four tunes 

 as long as the cerebro-visceral ganglion, and issues from a small ganglion 

 situated near the pedal ganglion, giving out a nerve before reaching the 

 eye, and continued in a third nerve beyond the eye. Cf. Ihering, 1. c. 

 p. 174. 



2 Alder and Hancock did not discover the otocysls in Tr. Hombergi, nor 

 did I, but they were seen by Ihering. 



3 The bulbus pharyngeus of the Tritonia; is, as also the tongue, very like 

 that of the FleurojjJii/Uidicp, but somewhat more flattened (cf. my Bidrag 

 til en'Monographi a{ FleurophylliidierJie, Naturh. Tidsskr. 3 R. iv. ISGG, pp. 

 224-356). The lip disk at the bottom of the oral tube is as in those ; also 

 the thick muscular plate at the front of the jaws (cf. 1. c. p. 229), and with 

 the usual transverse groove. In two individuals of the Tr. Uomhergi of 

 the length of 7.5 and 5.5 cm., the bulb. phar. had the length of 20 to 23 

 mm., a l)vcadth of 12 to 15 mm., and a height of 11.5 to 15.0 mm., or the 

 length of the bulbus amounted to about one-third that of the body ; on the 

 surface of the bulbus were marked partitions nearly as in the Pl( "rophyl- 

 lidiida; the sheath of the radula on the hinder and upper end of the bulbus 

 was distinct, but not prominent. The united jaws 23 to 24 mm. long, with 

 a breadth of 12 to 16, and a height of 6 to 7 mm. ; the breadth of the jaw 

 alone behind the articulation about 2.5, on the broadest part 6.75 to 7.0 

 mm. ; tlie free part of the proc. masticator. 1.5 to 2.0 mm. long; the articu- 

 lation rather prominent in front ; nearh' the posterior half of tlie cutting 

 edgf is serrated, every denticle composed of several, more or less coalescent, 

 conical points, elevated about 0.16 mm. ; a deep furrow for muscular inser- 

 tion nearly parallel with the cutting edge. 




102 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



breadth 13 mm., and the height 5 mm.; the jaw alone had behind 

 the articulation (fig. Ya) a breadth of 5.5 to 7.0 mm. in the hinder 

 part;' the length of the (free part of the) proc. viasticatorius 

 (fig. 76) 1.5 mm.; the articulation rather prominent in front; the 

 cutting edge in the posterior part slightly undulated, but plain, 

 under the microscope covei*ed with many irregular series of 

 irregular prismatic bodies (fig. Ifi) about 02 mm. liigh. The 

 tongue is large, broad, and high ; the radula narrower than in Tr. 

 Homhergi^ brownish-yellow, with nineteen series of teeth.^ On , 

 the under side of the tongue, moreover, the marks of eight series 

 of teeth remain, the teeth themselves having been dropped. There 

 were under the tectum radulse and in the sheath twent^'-five full}' 

 developed series, and six which were yd ox\\y partU' colored. 

 The number of series in all fifl}'. The numl)er of teeth was, in 

 one of the foremost series of the radula, al)out two hundred and 

 twent3'-five (on each side), and the number seemed not to increase 

 notably farther backwards. The median tooth is like a compressed 

 pyramid, somewhat narrower in the hinder part (PI, IV. fig. 8aa; 

 Pi. Y. figs, laa, 2a), with the upper part bent backwards (fig. 8); 

 the posterior margin more or less rounded, the anterior margin 

 (fig. laa) with a slight cleft,- the continuation of which (fig. 2a) 

 forms a groove on the anterior side of tliC i)yramid. The first 

 lateral tooth shaped nearly as the medial is, but (fig. 866ec, 166, 

 2) narrower and longer, the (fig. 8) upper part less prominent, 

 less crooked, and commonly more rounded at the top (fig. 8). 

 The second lateral tooth either nearh^ like the first (fig. 8(/), or 

 with a distinct beginning of the form (fig. 1(^, 2), that reigns 

 through the long series of external teetii (fig. 12) ; all these lateral 

 teeth are high (fig. 9), compressed, crooked ; the point rather 

 blunt; the basal part of the teeth is continued in an uncolored 



' The form of the maudibulfc is rather similar to the figure of Pallas (1. 

 0. fig. 22a). 



2 In a very large individual of the Tr. Homhergi the (always large) 

 radula contained forty-three series of teeth, behind which were forty-seven 

 additional series, the total number of rows being ninety. In the forty- 

 second row or series, on each side, were about two hundred and eleven 

 teeth, in the fifty-second rov/ two hundred and twenty-niue lateral teeth. 

 According to Alder and Hancock (1. c. part vii. pi. 46, suppl.) the number 

 of rows is eighty-four, and the number of lateral teeth two hundred and 

 twenty-one.

(not tliic-kened >, flexilile process (fig. 0). The one to two outer- 

 most teetli small nnd in form very variable (fig. lOoo, Waa). The 

 teeth (in their thickened parts) of yellowish color, somewhat 

 darker and less clear than in the typical species. The length of 

 the raehidian teeth in the hinder part of the tongue 0.2 mm.; the 

 greatest height of the lateral teeth (in about the same region) 0.4 

 mm. Double plates (fig. 12) were present. 



The glandnlse salivates were clay-yellowish, about 25.0 mm. 

 long, rather flattened; about 10.0 mm. broad on the under side, 

 se})arated by the oesophagus ; on the upper side confluent in a 

 large convex plate about 25.0 ram. broad. The efferent duets were 

 short. 



The (esophagus was about 38.0 mm. long, with a diameter of 

 11.0 mm., and rose from the foremost part of the bulbus pha- 

 rynrjeus; in the posterior half Avere rather strong longitudinal 

 folds passing without distinct limits into the stomach. The latter 

 formed a moderately sized sac at the anterior part of the Hvim*; 

 the under side Avas free, the u|)per decked b}' a flat lobe of the 

 liver. The stomach was somewhat compressed; in antero-poste- 

 rior direction about 9.0 mm. high; the cardia were wide with two 

 biliary orifices in the posterior part; above, a rather narrow 

 jnlorus with very strong folds; the walls of the stomach are 

 rather smooth. The intestine issues from the uppermost part of 

 stomacii, appearing on the surface of the liver at the left side of 

 the heart, following the left margin of the liver forwards, lotlged 

 in a groove on the surface, but l)ackward at the front and end of 

 the liver, following the right side of that organ, somewhat descend- 

 ing, then ascendino: asjain and terminating at the anus. The 

 anteriorly proceeding part of the intestine was al)Out 25.0 mm. 

 long, the rest was about 50.0 mm long, of which 15.0 mm. be- 

 longed to the part which ascends to the anus. The diameter of 

 . the terminal portions of the intestine was about 3.0 mm., of the 

 middle portion nearly 7.0 mm. Through nearly the whole length 

 of ^he intestine, and nearly reaching to the knee of the last 

 ascending part, was a strong and thick fold of about 3 mm. in 

 licight ; the last part of the same for a length of full 4 mm., free 

 and i)rojecting wing-like. Fine longitudinal folds, often siiining 

 through the walls of the intestine, were moreover seen through 

 the whole length of it, in the first part especially strong on the 

 under side; in the last i)art finer, partly ending in the folds of 




104 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



the anal opening (PI. III. fig. 65a). The contents of the intes- 

 tine, storaach, and oesophagus were indistinct animal matter. 



The liver of a cla3'-ye]lowish color, large ; tlie length about 4.7 

 mra., with a breadth of 30, and a height of about 26.0 mm.; the 

 hinder end rounded; the foremost half of the lower lobe wanting, 

 its place occupied by the stomach; the front, therefore, very 

 oblique, sloping backwards and somewhat towards the right side 

 (with an impression for the large anterior genital mass). On 

 the surface of the liver rather superficial furrows in different 

 directions, especially' transverse; through the middle part of the 

 upper side of the liver, beginning at the right side, a somewhat 

 deeper longitudinal furrow diverges towards the left side, con- 

 taining the renal chamljer; at the junction of the first and the 

 second third of the upper side a very deep transverse groove for 

 the pyloric part of the intestine (which turns to the left); but the 

 part of the liver before the groove is a continuation of the whole 

 liver, and not only of the left part of it (as in the Tr. Hombergi). 

 The structure of the liver is as in the t3'pical form. 



The atrium and ventricle of the heart are as usual, the ventricle 

 9.0 mm. long, and the renal S3-rinx about 3.0 mm. long, of the 

 usual structure; the renal chamber, as far as it could be deter- 

 mined, as in the Tr. Hombergi} 



The gland, hermaphrodisiaca not distinguishable in color from 

 the liver, covering the surface of that organ nearl}' as in the Tr. 

 Hombergi, and of similar structure. The follicles contained zo- 

 osperms and large oogene cells. 



The anterior genital mass vevy large, 30.0 mm. long, 18.0 mra. 

 in greatest breadth, and 23.0 ram. in greatest height. The ductus 

 hermaphrodisiacus issues from the upper part of the front of the 

 liver about in the middle line under the first reflection of the in- 

 testine. It is j-ellowish, not long, and about 1.0 mra. in diameter. 



It swells rather abrupth' into the ampulla, which is very long- 

 and strong, and forms a bunch of thick coils on the back of the 

 anterior genital mass. When straightened the ampulla was about 

 120.0 mm. long; diameter variable, but reaching 6.0 mm. It was 

 crammed with zoosperms. The sperraato-duct {vas defereyis) was 

 strong, not long ; furnished before entering the penis (in the speci- 

 men examined), with an ampulliform dilatation; then penetrating

the whole length of the everted peuis, with several irregular dila- 

 tations and constrictions through the posterior part, and ending 

 on the blunted point of that organ with a small round orifice. 

 The spermato-diict is attached to the walls of the penis b^' 

 abundant connective tissue ; its wall is very thick ; the inside in 

 the posterior part with some strong longitudinal folds, clothed 

 with a fine epithelium, which towards the end of tlie penis is about 

 0.07 mm. in thickness. The (PI. III. fig. I3d) penis, as above 

 stated, flagelliforra. about 20.0 mm. long, under the loop fur- 

 nished with a whitish covering, parth' confluent, partly scattered; 

 in the skin tiirough the whole length of the oi'gan an infinity of 

 bottle-shaped, glistening glands about 0.035 to 0.04 mm. in lenu-Lli. 

 The apermatotheca pyriform, about 9 mm. long, passing without 

 precise limit into a short ductus, that is a little dilated *in the 

 inferior part (vagina). The large mucous gland convex in front; 

 on the back rather flat toward the anterior part, in the posterior 

 excavated (for the reception of the ampulla of the hermaphroditic 

 duct); the duct short; the cavit}' of the organ narrow, empty. ^ 



DORIDID^. 



This large group is easily distinguished through the (retractile 

 or not retractile) branchial rosette on the middle of the back. 

 This character is only found in a single other group of o-astero- 

 poda, the Doriopnidse^ which, in their exterior characters, closely 

 simulate the Dorididse, and had l)een confounded with them, at 

 least so far that they were regarded as both belonging to a single 

 large group, until my examination of them' showed their affinity 

 to the FhijUidiidae,^ with which the}' were combined by me in a 

 larger group, the Porosfomala, particularlj-^ characterized through 

 their poriform "outer mouth," and the conversion of the bulbxs 

 pharyyigeua into a quite unarmed sucking apparatus. On the 

 contrary the Dorididae all show a very well-developed bulbxs, 

 witli a more or less strong tongue; and often also a particuhir 

 armature of the lip-disk on the anterior end of the bulbus, and

lip-plates of rather different kind and nature. With the Doriop- 

 sidae (Forostomata) the Dorididse agree in the presence of two 

 spermatothecse, and of a vascular gland connected with the cen- 

 tral nervous system. 



There have been detected but a small number of the generic 

 forms and species belonging to this large family during Dall's 

 expeditions.

When Linne, in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae 

 (1158), founded the genus Doris^ he referred but one species to it 

 (cf. my Mai. Unters. [in Semper, Reise Philipp. II. ii.], Heft x. 

 18*76, p. 388), his D. verrucosa. This, which was founded only on 

 the figures of Seba and Rumphius, is probably indeterminable, 

 and the Doris of the tenth edition of the Syst. Nat. should, there- 

 fore, not have been retained. 



In the twelfth edition (1767) the genus embraces, beside D. ver- 

 rucosa^ which still figures as first species, three other forms, the 

 D. bilamellata, D. laevis, and Z>. argo. 



One of these should become the tj-pe of the restricted genus 

 Doris^ but which ? It would be much better to quite do away 

 with the name Doris as a generic designation (especiall}' as it was 

 also used in another sense by Linnd, for the animal of various 

 shell-bearing mollusks), and under this view the genus Archidoris 

 has been formed. 



This generic group, which is congeneric with the first of the sec- 

 tions establislied by Alder and Hancock (Monogr. part vii. 1855, 

 p. xvi.) in their s^'stematic prospectus, is ratlier distinctly' marked. 

 The animals are of a rather hard consistencj', of a robust, and 

 not much depressed form. The tentacles are formed in folds 

 higher inwards. The openings of the rhinophoria are simple. The 

 back more or less granulous and tuberculous. The (retractile)

 lip-di^k clothed with a simple thick ciiticula. The radnla with 

 naked rhachis, the plem;u with numerous hook-shaped uncini. 

 The ventricle is large, free. The penis unarmed. 



The group, so far as yet known, contains but few species.

Four specimens of this form were collected by Bischoff at low 

 water in Sitka Harbor. Two were small and two much larger, 

 but otherwise similar in every respect. No notes have been re- 

 ceived in regard to the living animal. The si)ecimens were sent 

 me in a dried condition. Tliey were of a-yellowisii or ochraceous 

 3'ellow color with a larger or smaller number of roundisli black 

 spots on the back, here and there confluent in irregular large 

 patches on tlie middle of the back, which were nevertheless indis- 

 tinctly arranged in two series. The specimens measured 18.0- 

 40.0 mm. in length, 11-24.0 mm. in breadth, and .^-13.0 mm. high. 

 Tlie width of tlic rhino[>liorJal orifices in tiie largest specimen 4."i, 

 and of the brancliial ai)erture 10.0 mm. The l>aek was covered, 

 quite as in the typical species, with large and small rounded 

 tubercles, reaching 1.5 mm. in diameter in the largest individual. 

 The foot was large, exactly as in the ty[)ical species ; the tentacles, 

 as far as could be determined, of the usual kind. 



In two of the individuals the gill was expanded, and the num- 

 ber of the branchial leaves 80.

' " Pale yellowish, with scattered black spots (or entirely brown ?) ; 

 mantle rough, tubfrculnte, or nearly smooth ; dorsal tentacles knobsliaped ; 

 branchial rays bipinnate, short, in eight divisions, forming a crown-shaped 

 expansion on the posterior third of the dorsum. Foot expanded into a 

 broad, thin margin as wide as the mantle. • Length 3", breadth 1", heiglit

of examining a colored drawing of the animal made by Cooper. 

 The color of the back was here ochre-yellow, with scattered small 

 and some larger black spots ; on the middle of the back especially 

 several larger elongate irregular patches ; the rhinophoria of 

 somewhat more reddish color. In the gill eight leaves. 



Through cautions emollition of one of the larger and one of the 

 smaller individuals the nature of the Hp-dif^k and of the armature 

 of the tongue could be determined. The former was quite as in 

 the typical species. The tongue showed thirteen to fifteen rows of 

 plates ; the number of rows further backward could not be deter- 

 mined with certaint}', there seemed to be about fourteen to fifteen 

 developed rows, and the total number of plates thus seemed 

 scarcely to exceed thirty-three to thirty-six. The series seemed 

 to contain about sixty to seventy plates. These plates (figs. 6, 7) 

 were very like those of the typical species, perhaps the hook was 

 a little slenderer; the height of the outermost plates (fig. 7) was 

 commonly about 0.1-0,15, and the height increased through the 

 series of plates to about 0.28 mm. 



Perhaps this form might prove to be merel}'^ a varietj' of the D. 

 tuberculata.

 The Chromodoridee of Alder and Hancock, the Goniobranchi of 

 Pease were some years ago (1875) revised by me after careful ex- 

 amination of fourteen species, three of which were then published, 

 the rest more recently (1878). 



Meanwhile I had shown^ that the genera Glossodoris, Actino- 

 doris, and Pterodoris, established by Elirenberg in 1831, should 

 be dropped, being founded on non-essential and inconstant cha- 

 racters of the branchial leaflets of different Chromodorides. 

 ^Moreover a part of the genus Doriprismatica^ established by 

 D'Orbigny (1834) belongs to this group. The name given by 

 Alder and Hancock must be conserved for this genus.

111 the latest of 1113- cited papers was moreover given a supple- 

 ment to the former list of described or denominated Dorides, that 

 could be referred with more or less probability to this group. The 

 uumber of species amounted to about ninet}'. 



In external form the Chromodorides somewhat agree with the 

 Goniodorides, but have much more ga}' and handsome colors, 

 mosth' forming longitudinal strii)es. The tentacles are small, 

 conical; the (retractile) rhinophoria with denselj' perfoliated club. 

 The margin of tlie mantle on the anterior and posterior ends de- 

 veloped in a frontal and a caudal veil, which sometimes shows 

 peculiar knots.' The (retractile) gill is formed of simply pinnate 

 plumes, sometimes divided at the toi). The foot rather narrow. 

 The h'p-di.''k^ with an annular hard lamina, composed of densel}' 

 set small hooks, mostly bifurcated at the top. In the radula no 

 median plates, but often on the rhachis peculiar thickenings 

 (pseudo-plates). Tlie lateral plates, of ordinary form, nearly 

 always serrulated or denticulated on the margin of the hook. 

 The penis unarmed. 



In the southern part of the Pacific the Chromodorides are repre- 

 sented b3' a whole series of species ; from the northern part 

 (China) only a few representatives are known ; among the si)eci- 

 mens sent by Dall onl}' two species were detected, the hitherto 

 known most northern representatives of this group, of which no 

 form has j'et been found in the northern part of the Atlantic.

An individual of this species was obtained, during the progress 

 of the U. S. Boundary Commission, b}' Dr. KennerJ}-, the lamented 

 naturalist of the U. S. party, in Puget Sound. No notes have 

 come to hand in regard to the living animal. 



The animal preserved in spirits was 11.5 mm. long, 5.5 broad, 

 and 4.2 mm. high. The height of the rhinophoria was 1.25 mm., 

 of the tentacula 0.75 mm., of the branchial leaves 2.0 mm.; the 

 breadth of the mantle maigin 1.2 mm., of the foot 2.5 mm., and 

 the length of the tail was 2.5 mm. The ground-color of the back 

 and sides isabelline-gray, everywhere covered with small, and 

 still smaller, coal-black, rounded points al)Out 0.25 mm. in dia-

meter, which were also visible on the' under side of the mantle 

 edo-e and on the upper side of the foot. The sides were also 

 abundantly furnished with bright yellow points, appearing in 

 smaller number also on the back where they are, for the most part, 

 repre-ented by yellow ocelli with darker yellow pupils. The man- 

 tle-edo-e had a yellow margin on the upper side ; there was also a 

 fine yellow line along the upper side of the edge of the foot. The 

 stalk of the rhinophoria was gray, the club (grayish) reddish. 

 Tlie branchiae and tentacula grayish-white witli a 3*ellow colored 

 rhachis on the outer and posterior edge. 



The branchial leaves with a few scattered black points, the mar- 

 oin of the orifice for the rhinophoria and of the gill cavity embel- 

 lished with a yellow line. 



The form as usual; the mantle edge rather prominent, the 

 frontal and caudal veil not particularly developed (witliout traces 

 of laroer nodules on the under side). The club of the rhinophoria 

 strono- with about thirty broad leaves; the tentacles conical (as 

 it seemed), retractile in a little cavitj-. The gill consisting of 

 fifteen (PI. XIII. fig. 1) simple plumes; increasing four times in 

 height from the posterior involute end gradually forward. The 

 angles of the anterior margins of the foot not ver}- prominent. 



The intestines not shining through the walls of the body; the 

 peritoneum colorless. 



The central nervous sj-stem yellow. The cerehro-visceral ganglia 

 reniform, the two divisions of nearly equal size ; the rounded pedal 

 ganglia a little larger than each of them ; the great commissure 

 not short. The proximal olfactory ganglia of about tlie same size 

 as the distal (at the root of the club of the rhinophorium), larger 

 than the optic ganglion. The buccal ganglm (PI. XIV. fig. la) 

 larcrer than the olfactory^ of oval form, connected b\- a rather short 

 commissure ; the gadro-cet<ophageal (PI. XIV. fig. 16) rather short 

 stalked developed on one side of the nerve, small — about one- 

 eio-hth the size of the former, with one large and some smaller 

 cells. The nervi optici rather short. The eye with black pig- 

 ment and a yellow lens. The otoc^'sts of about the same size as 

 the eyes, the number of otoconia not very large. The leaflets of 

 the rhinophoria and the tentacula without spicule, the skin of the 

 back and the interstitial tissue nearly so. 



The oral tube very large, about 2.0 mm. long by 2.2 mm. in 

 diameter, with strong, internal, longitudinal folds.

 point (fig. 3). 



The tongue as usual, with about forty rows of teeth, behind 

 which were sixty-six rows of developed, and six rows of immature 

 teeth, the total number being one hundred and twelve. The teeth 

 of yellowish color, except the rhachidian and external uncini, 

 which were nearl}' colorless. The height of the second lateral

 0.05 mm., of the outermost uncini 0.025 to 0.03 mm. On the 

 narrow rliachis was a median pseudo-plate (rhachidian boss) 

 about 0.035 mm. long, pointed anteriorly (PI. XIII. fig. 4; PI. XIV. 

 fig. la) broader and rounded behind (PI. XIII. fig. 5) consisting of 

 a high anterior portion wiiich falls abruptly toward the plain part, 

 slopes gradually towards the fore-end, and is divided bj' a longi- 

 tudinal groove into two halves (figs. 4, 5). On each side of the 

 median plate twenty-seven to twenty-nine laterals. The lateral 

 teeth of usual form, somewhat low; the (PI. XIV. fig. 2) first with 

 fcnir to five denticiilations on each side of the low hook; the rest 

 (figs. 6, 7, 8) with such only on the outer side, mostly with six to 

 seven, more rarely (especially on the inmost plates) with four to 

 five, or at the utmost with eight to nine denticles ; the six outer- 

 most of the usual aberrant form, without denticulations (PI. XIV. 

 fig. 3). 



The mlivaivj glnn(h long, ribband-shaped, whitish. The ce.^o-

Of this very handsome species Dall obtained an individual on 

 algffl at low water in the harbor of Catalina Island, California, 

 January, 1874. (Specimens have also been seen from Monterey 

 and San Diego.— W. H. D.) 



The color of the living animal, according to Dall, was " ma- 

 zarin-blue with golden spots" (changing to greenish-blue in the 

 alcohol, which it continues to color for a long time, and after 

 several changes for fresh spirit. — W. H. D.). 



The rather contracted animal in spirits was 12.0 mm. long, and 

 6.0 mm. broad and high. The height of the retracted rhinophoria 

 "was 1.3 mm., of the retracted branchial plumes 1.5 mm., the length 

 of the tail about 2.5 mm., and the breadth of the foot 2.0 mm. 



The color was uniforml}' greenish-blue (which it had also given 

 out to the alcohol). On the back were several yellowish-white, 

 round spots, a millimetre in diameter. On the anterior part they 

 were chiefly in the median line, on the rest in two longitudinal 

 series, outside of which on the back were scattered some similar 

 spots and on each side of the body was a line of four or five more 

 of the same kind. A brighter, fine line seemed to border the 

 margin of the mantle-edge and that of the foot. The rhinophoria 

 were green-blue, the gills dark green-blue; the internal connecting 

 branchial " meseuterium" and the root of the branchial leaves 

 partly silver-white. 



The form as usual. The mantle-edge little prominent except 

 over the head and tail, the breadth on this last part being about 

 1.65 ram.; on the under side of the caudal veil thus formed were 

 six semi-globular nodules (fig. 5) one full mm. in diameter. The 

 tentacles as usual; the club of the rhinophoria with about twent}' 

 leaves. The gills formed of nine leaves of nearl}- equal size; the 

 anal papilla rather low ; posteriorly completing the branchial ring. 

 The peritoneum with a light-bluish hue. The pericardium bluish. 




18T9.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 113 



The central nervous system as usual, but less depressed, and of 

 greenish color; the cerebro-visceral ganglia reniforra, somewhat 

 broader in front; tlie distinc-tion between the cerebral and the 

 visceral parts very pronounced, the latter a little smaller than the 

 former; the pedal ganglia rounded, a little larger than the visceral. 

 The buccal ganglia larger than tiie (proximal) olfactory, roundish, 

 connected by a rather short commissure; the gastro-cjesophageal 

 roundish, having about ojie-tenth of the size of tiie former, rather 

 short-stalked, developed on one side of the nerve, with one very 

 large and a few smaller cells. The proximal olfactory ganglia 

 rather depressed — bulbiforra ; the distal ones much smaller, of oval 

 form. 



The lens of the eye was greenish-blue, the pigment brownish- 

 black; the retina bluish. The otocysts were as usual. There 

 were no spiculiB in the skin, the leaves of the rinnophoria or the 

 interstitial tissue, which was alwa3's of a greenish-blue color. 

 The nodules of the caudal veil resembled those of other species 

 possessing them. 



Tlie oral tube was about 2.5 mm. long, and 1.0 mm. in diameter 

 at the posterior end ; of greenish-blue color throughout. The 

 bidbiis pharyngeus of the same or a darker shade, about 3.0 mm. 

 long, by a breadth of 2. .5 mm , :ind a height of nearly 2.0 mm. 



The large sheath of the radula prominent posteriorly is also 

 about 1.0 mm. in diameter. The lii)-plate3 are of a grayish olive- 

 green color, separated at their upper (fig. 6) and mf)re widely at 

 their lower ends. The plates are scarcely narrower above, the 

 nearlv uniform breadth l)eing 1.5 mm. The elements of the plates 

 reach the length of 0.045 mm., with thick, recurved, hooked points 

 (figs. T-10), these last were seldom cleft (fig. 10). The elements 

 adjacent to the spaces between the i)lates were much smaller and 

 of irregular form (fig. 0). The tongue was of the usual form, the 

 radula shining like silver and grayish-green in eolor. In tlie 

 radula were thirty-five rows of plates, behind which were fifiy-oue 

 well-formed and six immature rows ; the total amounting to eighty- 

 two rows. In the posterior rows of the tongue were ninety-eight 

 teeth on each side of the narrow and nake<l rhaehis. The teeth 

 had a very pronounced greenish hue ; rising to the height of about 

 0.1 mm., that of the outermo.st was about 0.04 to 0.06 mm. Tlie 

 form as usual; the hook bifurcated at the point, the outer ami 

 posterior branch shorter, denticulated (figs. 11-13), and the den-

ticuliitions contiimecl downwards along the exterior margin of the 

 hook (fig. 13). The innermost teeth (fig. 11) lower and with 

 fewer denticles ; the largest number of teeth generally with about 

 six to eight denticles; the outermost plates (fig. 14) of the usual 

 modified form, sometimes rather irregular (fig. 13). 



The (about 7 mm.) long, ribband-formed salivary glands through 

 their white color contrasted with the green of the arljacent viscera; 

 in their foremost part broader, having a breadth of about 0.6 mm., 

 in the rest of their length thin. 



The liver grayish-green, about 5.5 mm. long, b}- a breadth of 4 

 and a height of 3 mm.; the substance more yellow. The heart 

 and especiall}^ the renal region, of greenish color. The sanguineous 

 glands greenish, much flattened; the anterior linguiform about 

 1.75 mm. long, with a breadth of about 0.6 mm.; the posterior of 

 about the same length, a little broader. The anterior genital mass 

 small, about 2.5 mm. long, b}' a breadth and a height of 1 mm., 

 of blue-green color, as were the different component organs of the 

 mass. The spermatotheca as usual, spherical ; the spermatocysta 

 shorter than in the former species. The penis as in other species.

It is useless to discuss the question, if the D. leems Linnd

to try to determine, if tlie D. laevU should iiappen to be the D. 

 obvelata of 0. Fr. IMiiller, as supposed by Lovdn.' In man}' 

 cases the authors of the present time are unable to determine 

 the species described by authors of late date; it is in most 

 cases still more impossible to determine the species described by 

 elder authors. Better to leave those names of the past to obliv- 

 ion. Science, after all, ought not to take notice of any Xudi- 

 branchiate, that was not anatomically examined; as without such 

 examination it is in many cases not possil)le even to determine 

 the genus, to which in reality the species belongs. The form 

 described and figured by Alder and Hancock as D. repanda is on 

 the contrarj' determinable, and this name ought to be preserved, 

 althougli perhaps identical with the elder denominations of Linne 

 and of Miiller. 



Of this species I have had five specimens for anatomical exami- 

 nation ; two klndl}^ sent me b}' Mr. Friele, of Bergen, and obtained 

 in that vicinity; two from Samso, Kattegat, and from the Island 

 of Zeeland (Denmark), and one from the neighborhood of Kiel, 

 for which I am indebted to the friendship of Prof. Moebius ; the 

 individuals agreed in their internal and external structure. 



The color of alcoholic specimens was uniformly white or yel- 

 lowish-white. The Norwegian specimens were 11-19.0 mm. long, 

 6.5-8.0 mm. broad, and 3.5-6.0 mm. high. The breadth of the 

 foot was 2.6-4.5 mm., of the mantle-edge 1.5-2.5 mm.; the height 

 of the rhinophoria l."2-2.0 mm., of the gill 1.5-2.5 mm ; the cor- 

 responding measurements of the Danish specimens were 20.0-23 0, 

 14.0-15.0, 8.-9.0, 4.-6.0, 3.5-3.Y5, and about 2.0 and 3.0 mm. The 

 lengtli of the individual from Kiel was about 8.0 mm. 



The form was rather depressed, the outer part of the mantle- 

 edge not thick. The back was covei'ed all over with small and 

 very small papilla?, obtuse or more pointed, low and rounded.'- 



The rhinophorial orifices were not prominent, but were slightly 

 crenulated on the margin. The club showed fifteen to twenty

 nieter 1.5-2 mm.) round, not prominent, with a reflexed and 

 scarcely crenulated maryin. Tlie gill consisted of five tripinnate 

 leaflets,'-' the anterior median hardly smaller than the others. The 

 two anterior laterals were often cleft so as to simulate two plumes. 

 The anal tube was short, truncate, situated between the two pos- 

 terior branchial plumes, the renal orifice at the right side. 



The head was small, consisting of the moutli and two small 

 flattened tentacles, with a furrow along their outer margin. The 

 flattened genital papilla furnished with a rather contracted orifice; 

 in its upper part always a more or less (1.0 mm.) projecting trian- 

 gular or spoon-siiaped lobe (figs. 21, 22). The foot straight or a 

 little rounded in the forepart, strong!}' grooved in the margin ; the 

 ui)per lip sligiitly cleft in the median line.' The peritoneum color- 

 less. The five individuals were dissected. 



Tlie central nervous s^'stem showed the cerebral ganglia of 

 rounded-triangular form, sometimes somewhat elongated, larger 

 than the visceral ones, which are more rounded. In connection 

 with the hind part of the under side of the right cerebral ganglion 

 was a small rounded ganglion (of about 0.07 mm. diameter) pro- 

 minent between the hinder part of tlie cerebral ganglia, and giving 

 off a long nerve backwards. In connection with the anterior part 

 of the upper side of the cerebral ganglion was an optic ganglion, 

 a little smaller than the former; the n. opticus rather short. In 

 connection with the posterior part of the under side of the visceral 

 ganglion through a rather short nerve is an oblong ganglion geni- 

 tale,* giving off a long nerve to the anterior genital mass (penis?) ; 

 the ganglion containing cells of rather unequal size. The pedal 

 ganglia are situated i)erpendicularly or oblicjue to tlie former, and 

 a little compressed. The commissure rather broad and short, as 

 l(mg as the largest diameter of the pedal ganglion; the proximal 

 olfactory ganglion Ijulbiform, very short stalked, a little smaller 

 than the buccal ones. No true distal was observed. The visceral

» The markings on tlie under >ide of the njantle-lirim (cf. Alder and Han- 

 cock, 1. c. lig. 2) were not visible. 



♦ This ganglion had already been seen by Hancock and Emblelon 1 1. c.

ganglia were of oval form, connected b}' a very short commissure ; 

 the gastro-a'sophageal oblong, about one-eiglith the size of the 

 last, short stalked, developed on the side of the nerve ; with a 

 single large and several small cells. 



The eye showed a 3'ellow lens and deep black pigment. The 

 otocysts visible as chalk-wiiite spots under the loop iu the usual 

 position, with about one hundred otoconia of the ordinary kind. 

 There were sparingly- scattered calcified spiculae, 0.25-0.30 mm. 

 long, in the broad and rather thick leaves of the rhinophoria, set 

 perpendicularly or obliquely on tlie free margin of the leaves. 

 The skin was profusely furnislied with large and small rod-shaped 

 spiculae. mostly much calcified ; in the axes of the granules of the 

 back were bundles of perpendicular spicule as usual. In the in- 

 terstitial connective tissue a very few large spicules. 



The oral tube was wide (1.0-2.5 ram. long). The bulbus pha- 

 ryngeus of the usual form, about 1.3-2.25 ram. long, 1.2-2.0 mra. 

 broad, and 1.0-1.75 high. The radula also projected 0.3-0.75 ram. 

 from the posterior part of the under side of the bulbus. The 

 true mouth of triangular form, the point upwards. The lii)-plate 

 was deep horn-yellow, narrow at the upper end and broader down- 

 ward at the lowest square part about 0.66 mm. broad ; it is com- 

 posed of densely set hooks, cleft at the point and rising to the 

 height of about 0.033 mm. (figs. 9, 10). The tongue broad and 

 flat; in the five individuals examined, furnished with twenty-six, 

 twent3--seven, thirty-six, thirty, and fifteen rows of teeth ; further 

 backwards thirty-three, thirty-four, twent3'-eight, thirt^^-six, and 

 thirt3"-two rows developed, and four immature rows; the total 

 number of rows sixt3'-three, sixty-five, sixt3^-eight, sevent3', and 

 fift3'-one.^ The basal plate of tlie teeth ratlier broad (fig. 16), the 

 hook standing nearly perpendicular on it. The median tooth 

 (figs. 11a, 12a, 13) broader on the posterior margin ; the cutting 

 edge of the recurved hook witli three to four denticles on each 

 side. The lateral plates'' in two individuals number onl3' twenty- 

 two to twent3' three ; in three others twent3'-five to twenty-six on 

 the hind part of the tongue, and further backwards twent3--eight 

 to twent3-nine ; the three to four foremost rows were alwa3's ver3- 



' According to Alder and Hancock the nnmber of rows is sixty-eight. 

 I found the lowest number in the sniuU individual from Kiel. 



* The number was according to Alder and Ilaucock twenty-two, and to 

 Zyie}'er and Moeblus eighteen.

incomplete. The first plate -with seven to nine denticles at tlic 

 enter side of the hook, and with three to fonr on the inner side 

 (figs. 1166, 1266). The second and third (fig. 14) with hroad l)asal 

 plate, as (figs, 14, .3) also all the sncceeding plates withont denti- 

 culation of the inner margin; on the outer edge (PI. V., fig. 1.5) 

 a certain number of denticles, increasing to twenty or twenty- 

 five. In the outermost part of the rows the number of denticles 

 decreased (fig. 1.*)) ; the outermost plates were of very variable form 

 (figs. 15a, 4a). The height of the outermost i)late sometimes onlj- 

 0.007. generall}' 0.04-0.05 mm., the height of the next plate about 

 0.06, of the next 0.0T5 mm.; the iieight rising to about 0.1 mm.; 

 the height of the innermost lateral plate 0.04, of the fifth 0.06 mm. 

 The color of the j)lates was pale yellow, the outermost colorless. 



The salivary glands strong, whitish or yellowish, flattened, with 

 a breadth of 1.5 mm., forming two to three short coils at the sides 

 of the wsophagus; the duct very short. The ref<ophagus,aa usual, 

 also the stomach. The intestine emerging from the liver (fig. 

 17a) behind the middle of its u[)per side; the first part proceeding 

 towards the fore end of the liver, in the largest individuals about 

 5.8 mm. long, somewhat wider in the pyloric part, the descending 

 part of the intestine nearly 13-17 mm. long, with a nearly con- 

 stant breadth of 0.75-1 mm. The liver (in the largest indivi- 

 duals) about 1.. 3-1 5.0 mm. long, by a breadth of 7-70, and a 

 height of 6-7.5 mm.; about half of the liglit anterior part strongly 

 flattened for the reception of the anterior genital mass, the pos- 

 terior end rounded ; the color of the surface yellowish-white, the 

 substance (when cut) j'cllow. The biliary sac whitish, very dis- 

 tinct (fig. 176) on the surface of the liver, about 2 mm. long, 

 laying at the anterior end of the pyloric part of the intestine, on 

 the right side. 



The lieart and renal chamber as usual; the last white, very 

 large, reaching to the fore-end of the liver. The sanguineous 

 gland whitish, ver\' flattened, about 3.5-5.0 mm. in largest dia- 

 meter, covering the central nervous system. Tlie yolk-yellow 

 liermaphroditic gland covering tiie upper and right side of the 

 liver (fig. 17oc) occasionally with groups of lobes scattered on the 

 under side, but never forming a nearly continuous layer over the 

 liver. The structure was as usual, with large oogene cells and 

 zoospcrms in the lobules. The anterior genital mass large, in 

 the largest specimens 8-8.5 mm. long, 3.5-4.0 mm. broad, and 




120 PROCEEDINOS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1879. 



6-1.0 mm, higli, ovoid, plano-convex, flattened on the left side. 

 The ampulla of the hermaphroditic duct usually crossed over the 

 left side, whitish, sausage-shaped, 6-1 mm. long, by 1.1-2.0 mm. 

 in diameter. The windings of the spermatoduct rested on the 

 anterior margin of the genital mass, the first part thicker but not 

 much longer than the rest, which was thinner and stronger (in 

 the largest individual 7-10.0 mm. long). A stricture unites the 

 two parts, the last passing without definite limits into the nearly 

 cylindrical or elongate-conical (retracted) penis, which was about 

 1.5-2.5 mm. long, the somewhat elongated glans being straight or 

 curved, 0.5-0.6 mm. in length, by 0.08-0.1 mm. in diameter (fig. 

 18). It was furnished with irregularl}' set (fig. 5) rows of pale- 

 yellowish hooks, which rose to a height of about 0.016 mm. They 

 were straight or curved, sometimes irregular or connate (figs. 5, 

 6), mostly solitar}', yet sometimes arranged in small groups 

 (fig. 6); the sperm duct continued (fig. 18a) through the whole 

 length of the glans to the round orifice on the point of the 

 glans; there was no continuation of the armature of the glans 

 backwards over a longer portion of the sperm duct. The sperma- 

 totheca spherical, about 2-3-0 mm. diameter; its own duct a little 

 longer than the leg, rather wide, then uniting with the thinner 

 and somewhat longer (and wider at the union) duct of the f^per- 

 matocysta, which was also round and of the diameter of 1-1.5 

 mm.; both organs resting upon the anterior margin of the mucus 

 gland; the vagina about as long as, and a little wider than, the 

 special duct of the spermatotheca.^ The large mucous gland 

 j-ellowish-white or yellow; the opaque part on the upper part of 

 left side yellow or brownish ; the cavity emi^ty.

a slight tinge of olive. The rliiiiophoria and bianchiae of deeper 

 3'ell()W. It was about 28.0 mm. long, 13 mm. broad, and 7.0 

 mm. high; the foot 7.0 and the free mantle edge 3.0 mm. broad. 

 The rhinopiioria 2..T mm. and tlie branchial leaflets 3.5 mm. high. 

 It' was of rather depressed elongate form; the mantle margin 

 rather broad. The back covered all over with rather small com- 

 pressed or rounded densely set tubercles, which often coalesced, 

 forming short longitudinal folds. These nearly disappeared at 

 tile margin of the mantle. The rhinophoiial orifices situated 

 rather forward with several tubercles on their margins, the club 

 of the rhinophoria with twelve to fifteen large and very oblique 

 leaves. The opening of the branchial cavity (the branchial leaves 

 retracted) was a longitudinal slit of about 4 mm. in length, and 

 ratiier narrow; the margin of it with tubercles of the usual kind. 

 The branchial leaves nine in numlier, four lateral pairs and one 

 anterior unpaired, tripinnate. The anal tube low, with two 

 (lateral) lips (fig. 19); the renal pore in front of and at its right 

 side. The outer mouth a small longitudinal slit; the tentacles 

 ver}' small, with a furrow at the upper part of their outer margin. 

 The under side of the mantle edge even ; a small deep groove for 

 the head. The sides of the body rather low; the genital opening 

 round, with at least two openings in its depth. The foot rounded 

 at the fore end with traces of a fine furrow, the posterior end 

 somewhat pointed. 



Tlie intestines where visil)le through the skin. The peritoneum 

 colorless, nearly without spicula. 



The central nervous system showed the cerebral and the vis- 

 ceral ganglia very distinct; the cerebral short, reniform, a little 

 broader in the anterior part, a little larger than the buccal, bulbi- 

 form, short-stalked ; tlie optic ganglia scarcely' equal to one-tenth 

 of the size of the latter; the optic nerve short. The visceral 

 ganglia short, pyriform ; on the under side of the right hand are 

 a short-stalked genital ganglion, intermediate in size between 

 the optic and olfactory ganglia. Tiie pedal ganglia nearly per- 

 pendicular on the under side of and a little smaller than tlie vis- 

 ceral. The commissures rather short, the visceral nearly free 

 from the broad subcerebro-pedal. 



The buccal ganglia rounded and conuecteil by an extremely 

 short commissure. The gastro-tesophageal short stalked, ovoid,

about one-eighLli the size of the former, developed on one side of 

 its nerve with one ver}' large and several smaller cells. 



The e3'e provided with black pigment, and a yellow lens. The 

 otoc3'sts in their usual place, filled with ordinarj- otoconia. The 

 broad leaves of the rhinophoria Avith a rather large quantity of 

 spicula, generally set obliquely or perpendicularly on the free 

 margin. The spicula mostly rod-shaped, long, and much calcified. 

 These also occur abundantly in the skin of the back, often asso- 

 ciated in small groups. The tuljercles of the back were stiffened 

 in the ordinary way, but there were ver}' few spicules of the larger 

 kind in the interstitial tissue. 



The oral tube was about 2.5 mm. long, 1.8 mm. wide at the 

 posterior end, internally as usual ; the retractor muscles very 

 strong. The bulbus pharyngeus strong, about 3.0 mm. Long, 2.5 

 mm. broad, and 2.1 mm. high. The sheath of the radula project- 

 ing about 1 mm., bent upwards. The lip-disk rather broad ; the lip- 

 plate broad, broadest below, 3'ellow ; the lateral parts witii several 

 transverse folds; the elements (fig. 7, 8) scarcely different from 

 those of the typical species, or perhaps a little less crooked, of a 

 height of about 0.05 mm.; the mouth, of triangular form, quite 

 as in the C. repanda. The tongue of usual form with about thirty- 

 three rows of plates; further back forty-eight developed, and four 

 immature rows; the total number of them eighty-five; the first 

 ten rows of the tongue more or less incomplete.^ The number of 

 lateral plates in the hinder row of the tongue thirty-three, the 

 number scarcely' increasing in the sheath. The plates of yellowish 

 color; the breadth of the oldest plate (in the hinder part) 0.0-15 

 mm., the breadth of these plates increasing to O.OG mm.; the 

 height of the outermost plates about 0.04, and the height of the 

 lateral plates increasing to about 0.12 ram. The plates of nearly 

 the same form as in tlie last species. The median plate a little 

 eraarginated in the posterior margin; the short recurved hook 

 usually with 3-4 denticles on each side of the point (fig. 9, 10a), 

 sometimes this point was replaced by two single or bifid larger 

 denticles (fig. 9). The first lateral plate (fig. 1066) with 5-6 den- 

 ticles at the inside, and with 6-7 at the outside of the hook. 

 Through the 4-6 following plates (fig. 10) the size of the plates 



• The progression was as follows, 6—1—1, 4—1—3, 6—1—7, 10—1—12, 

 20—1—18, 22—1—19, etc. 




ISTO.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PIIILADELnilA. 123 



and the number of denticles did not much increase, after which 

 both gradualh' increased as usual (figs. 11-1 3 ». Still the number 

 of denticles in the individual examined hardl}' exceeded 18-22, 

 and was still smaller in the outer portion of the rows (fig. 15). 

 The three or four outer plates were of rather variable form (figs. 

 14-15) generally without denticles or only traces of them (figs. 

 14(70, 15a). 



The salivary glands were yellowish, flattened, riband-shaped, 

 10.0 mm. long, with a greatest breadth in the anterior part of 1.0 

 (fig. 20) ; the glands adhering to one another through more than 

 the posterior half; the ducts short (fig. 20a). The oesophagus 

 about 9.0 mm. long, rather thin, and somewhat broader in the 

 middle. The stomach narrow. The intestine appeared at the 

 surface of the liver behind the middle of that organ, was about 

 5.5 mm. long, reaching to the second fifth of that organ. The 

 reflected part was about 14,0 mm, long, and the alimentary cavity 

 was emi»t3'. 



The liver 14.0 mm. long, reaching 60 mm. in breadth and 5.3 

 mm. in height. The posterior end rounded, somewhat pointed, 

 more than half the right anterior portion flattened for the anterior 

 genital mass. The surface was gra3-ish-yellow, the substance 

 deeper j-ellow. The vesica fellea smaller than in the tyiiical 

 species, appearing at the right side of the p3'loric part of the in- 

 testine with a rounded upper end about 1.5 mm, in diameter. 



The heart as usual. The sanguineous gland whitish, flattened ; 

 about 6 mm. long, with a breadth in the posterior half of 3.5 mm. 

 in the anterior of scarcely- 2.0 ram., its thickness about 0,5 mm., 

 covering the largest part of the central nervous s^-stem. The 

 urinary chamber large. 



The hermaphroditic gland yolk-yellow, spread over the fore- 

 part of the liver, over the anterior part of its upper side and over 

 the lateral parts of this organ ; in its lobules were large oogene- 

 cells. The anterior genital mass large, about 9.5 mm. long, nearly 

 fi.5 ram. high, and 4,5 ram broad, oval plano-convex. The yellow- 

 ish hermaphroditic duct issued from about the middle of the 

 applanation on the forepart of the liver, rather strong, swelling 

 Jnto the yellow am[)ulla lh:it runs in short windings over the left 

 side of the anterior genital mass to its anterior end; the length 

 of the unrolled ami)ulla was about 9.0 mm,, its diameter onl}- 0,1

rior mtirgin of the genital mass; its first part about 15.0 mm. 

 long with a diameter of about 1.0 ram., 3ellowish, passing tlirongh 

 a slight stricture into the second, which has only half the length 

 and half the diameter and is of a paler color. The penis nearly 

 4.0 mm. long, and 1.5 mm. in diameter. The glans in the upper 

 end of the cavity having a length of nearly 1.0 mm. (fig, 17); 

 the cuticula clothing the inside of it seemed to present hooks 

 similar to those in the t>'pical species, but fewer and thinner (fig. 

 18). The spermatotheca spherical, about 3.0 mm. in diameter; 

 its duct as usual. The spermato-cysts spherical, about l.R mm. 

 in diameter. The ducts as usual, the cavity filled with sperma. 

 The mucus gland large, whitish, and yellowish-white; on the an- 

 terior part of the left side was a 3-olk-3'ellow mass, the large 

 cavit}^ empt}'. The spoon-shaped lobe in the vestibulum had a 

 length of nearly 2.0 mm. 



Since the above observations were made two other individuals 

 of the same species have come under my notice. They were 

 obtained by Dall in September, J 872, at Coal Harbor, Shumagin 

 Islands, xYlaska, on a mudd}- beach at low water. The color of 

 the living animal was "bluish." 



The specimens in spirits were 8.0 and 14.0 mm. long, 6.0 and 

 10.0 mm. broad, 3.5 and 5.0 mm. high respectively, and of ^-ellow- 

 ish color. Tiie form as above.

 mentioned, the gill with 8-9 leaves. The anal papilla as above. 

 Both specimens were dissected. 



The central nervous S3'stem, the e3'es, the oto-C3'sts, and the skin 

 quite as above mentioned. The oral tube about 1.5 mm. long. 

 The bulbtis 2^hary7}geiis in the largest individual about 1.75 mm. 

 long, and 1.5 mm. broad and high. The sheath of the radula rather 

 prominent, bent upwards. The mouth-slit triangular; the lip- 

 plates chocolate-brown in the larger, yellow in the smaller indi- 

 vidual ; the structure as usual. The hooks in general a little 

 thicker at the point. The tongue with twenty-seven to thirt3' 

 rows of plates ; further backwards thirty-six to thirty-nine freshl3' 

 developed and four immatuie rows; the totnl number of rows 

 was sixt3'-seven to sevent3'-three rows. In the posterior rows of ^ 

 the tongue twenty-seven to thirt3' plates. The plates as previ-

ON A NEW GENUS AND SPECIES OF SCOMBRID^ 

 BY W. N. LOCKINGTON. 



Since P. W. B. A vies, between the years 1854 and 18G3, de- 

 scril)ed nearly seventy species of fishes from the West Coast of 

 X. America, i)riiicii)ally from the neighborhood of San Francisco, 

 until m\- own scattered notes appeared in the Proc. Cal. Acad. Sci. 

 187ti, very little lias been done in ichthyology by naturalists resi- 

 dent on this coast. In 1863-18(54, Dr. J. G. Cooper, at that time 

 attached to the Geological Survey- of Cal., described eight species; 

 and altout the same time Mr. A. Garret, during a visit to tliis coast, 

 described a ^Nriirteiioid Hsu in a paper i)rincipally devoted to the 

 fishes of the Sandwich Islands. All these papers were published 

 in vol. iii. of the Proc. Cal. Acad. Sci. 



Meanwhile the ichthyology of this coast has received careful 

 attention from Gill, GUntiier. and Steindachner, the last of whom 

 visited us with the llassler Expedition, resided here a short time 

 and took away with him numerous specimens. 



It has for sftme time l)een my endeavor to collect together and 

 identify such of the species descri!)ed by the above authors, and 

 b}- Girard in vol. x. of the Pac. Rail. Reports, as occur in or near 

 the Ba}' of San Francisco, and to add to our knowledge of them 

 whatever information I can collect respecting their distribution, 

 life-colors,. variations, etc. 



In so doing 1 have meet with the following new form. 



CHKIOMITRA, nov. gen. 



Bod}- elongate, fusiform, cleft of mouth wide. First dorsal sepa- 

 rated from the second by an intersi)ace, seven or more spurious 

 fins behind dorsal and anal. Xo corselet or pectoral region, body 

 naked or covered with small scales. Teeth of moderate strength 

 in tiie jaws, none on the vomer or palatines. A longitudinal keel 

 on eacli side of tail. Seven branchiostegals. Dorsal spines 15. 

 Pectoral fins inserted at the level of the eye. This genus is dis- 

 tinguisiied from Scomber by the greater number of the finlets, 

 and by the want of a. uniform covering of scales; from Orc>/>iu^ 

 and Sarda by tlie absence of a corselet, and the presence of an 




134 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



interval between tlie two dorsals; from Cyhixim by the latter 

 character; and from all these genera by the absence of teetli on 

 either vomer or palatines. From Auxis it differs in the absence 

 of a corslet, in the larger size of the teeth, and in the greater 

 mimbcr of dorsal spines. Etymology, xpfia want^ ftiTpa stomacher, 

 viz., corslet. 



Chriomitra concolor, sp. nov. 



D. 15 17, YII. A. 1 17, VIII. 



Teeth in a single row, triangular, compressed, those of lower 

 jaw largest, none near the sj'mph^'sis. ^even or eight finlets he- 

 hind the dorsal, eight behind the anal; pectoral one-eighth of the 

 total length to the end of the central caudal rays, veiitrals small, 

 in length less than |th of the pectorals. 



Description. — Dorsal outline a regular gentle curve from snout 

 to tail, ventral outline similar to that of dorsal. 



Cleft of mouth slightl}^ oblique, maxillary reaching to a vertical 

 from the hinder mai'gin of the eye; its anterior part concealed 

 behind the preorbital when the mouth is closed. 



Jaws equal in front, teeth in a single row on the jaws, none on 

 the vomer or palatines. Teeth in lower jaw larger than those in 

 upper, compressed at base,'gentl3' curved inwards; those in upper 

 jaw much smaller, compressed, triangular, straight. 



Length of head slightly exceeding the greatest depth, and con- 

 tained about five times in the total length. 



Eye slightly oval, its longitudinal diameter contained seven 

 times in the length of the head; snout a little more than one-third 

 of the same length, tapering regularly to the tip; and convex 

 above, as is also the whole upper surface of the head. 



Hinder margin of preoperculum with a long shallow sinus, its 

 lower angle extending a little farther back than its upper extremitj-; 

 lower border almost straight, horizontal. Hinder margin of oper- 

 culum and suboperculum a regular curve. 



Distance from tip of snout to origin of first dorsal contained 

 about 4i times in the length to end of central part of caudal ; its 

 length of base very slightly less than its distance from tip of 

 snout. Second, third, and fourth dorsal spines highest, thence 

 diminishing rapidly in height to the tenth, the remainder short 

 and apparently isolated. 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADEI.PFII A . 135 



All the sitiiies are exceedingl}' slender and fragile; the longest 

 are about equal to one-third the length of the head. 



Interspace between the two dorsals about one-fourth of the 

 lengtli of the base of the first dorsal. 



Second dorsal commencing h'alf way between the tip of the snout 

 and the ori^rin of the caudal, increasing rapidly* in height to the 

 fourth, which is equal to the sixth, and slightly shorter than the 

 fifth, the fiftli a little less than half the length of the head. The 

 rays diminisli rapidly in height to the eleventh, which is about 

 half as long as the fifth ; the remaining ra3"S decrease slowl}' to 

 the last, which simulates a finlet. 



Anal similra" in form to second dorsal, but its rays somewiiat 

 shorter than the corresponding dorsal ones. 



Pectoral pointed, the raj'S diminishing very rapidly from the 

 fourth to the eleventh from its upper margin; the lllh to loth 

 rays nearly equal, remaining rays very rapidly* shortening. Centre 

 of base of pectoral in a line with a line drawn from the tip of the 

 snout tiirough the centre of the pu})il. 



Ventrals very small, less than two-fifths as long as the pectorals. 



Length of inner side of upper lobe of caudal a little le^s than 

 §tli of the length of the fisli (to end of middle caudal rays); lower 

 lobe slightly shorter. Lateral line diverging gradually from the 

 dorsal outline as far as the origin of the second dorsal, where it 

 lies slightly below the upper third of the heiglit, thence curving 

 downwards rapidly to a vertical from the front of the first dorsal 

 finlet, thence in an undulating line along the centre of the depth 

 to the caudal keel. 



A low keel, convergent posteriori}', above and below the central 

 keel of the caiidal ]»eduncle. 



Long narrow scales on the region behind the eye, along each 

 side cf the dorsal outline, and on the peduncle of the tail; re- 

 mainder of body naked. 



Color of the upi)er portions dark steel blue, becoming silvery 

 below; no streaks. 



The specimen in the possession of the Cal. Acad, of Sciences 

 was obtained in San Francisco Market, and was prol)ably taken. 

 as were previously examined speciujcns of this spei-ies, in Monte- 

 rey Bay. It is said to occasionally straggle as far north as San 

 Francisco, or even Tomules IJav.

On Hiihrid Fnchsiai^. — ^Ir. Thomas Meehan exhibited a seed- 

 ling fufhsia which had been obtained from F. f^nringfiejloro^ tliat 

 had been pollenised b}- a garden hyl»rid named "Inimitalile." 

 Mr. M. detailed tlie preeantions taken to avoid the nse by the 

 flower of its own pollen. This one exhibited was tlie only one 

 that had foliage and habit exactl}' like its female ])arent, and the 

 flowers were also alike in every particular. The five remaining, 

 had not yet flowered, but were more or less unlike the female pa- 

 rent, and unlike each other in appearance. The foliage of one 

 yel to flower was very much like the male parent; and one plant 

 which had been destroyed by an accident last summer was exactly 

 like the male |)arent. 



The chief point of interest was that the pollen from one. single 

 flower, operating in one single jjistil, and resulting in one single 

 berry, should produce such a dissimilar progeny. 



Note on the* Adoption of an Ant-Queen. — Mr, McCooK reported 

 the following case of the adoption of a fertile queen of Crenwlo- 

 gastei' Uneolata,, a small black ant, by a colcmy of the same spe- 

 cies. The queeu was taken in Fairmount Park Ajtril 10th, and 

 on M:iy 14th following was introduced to workers of a nest taken 

 the same day. The queen was alone within an artificial glass 

 formicaiy, and several workers were introiluced. One of these 

 soon found the queen, exhiliited much excitement, but no hostil- 

 ity, and immediately ran to her sister workers, all of whom were 

 presently clustered upon the queen. As other workers were 

 gradually introduced they joined their c(mirades until the bod^- 

 of the queen (wiio is much larger than the workers) was nearly 

 covered with them. They appeared to be holding on ly tl;^ir 

 mandibles to the delicate hairs upon the female's body, and.co«i- 

 tinually moved their anteniux; caressingly. This sort of atli^it.on 

 continued until the (piecn, escorted by workers, disappea'l^.,^ in 

 one of the galleries. She was entirely adopted, and tliehr iii'tcr 

 was often seen moving friel^", or attended by guards, aboi«'»tlie 

 nest, at times engaged in attending the larvje and nymphs Wtii<h 

 had been introduced with the workers of the strange colony. 

 The workers were fresh from their own natural home, and the 

 queen had been in an artificial home for a nutnth. As ."imonLr 

 ants the workers of dillerent nests ate usually hostile to each

071 Special Fecundity i7i Plants — At the meeting of the Botani- 

 cal Section. Mr. Thomas Meehan exhibited specimens and re- 

 marked on the curious fact that special fecundit}* was n'ot con- 

 fined to individuals of any one species of plants, but the species 

 themselves often exhibited peculiar fertility, as otlier species again 

 were characterized by an indisposition to produce seed. Occa- 

 sionally whole families or natural orders of plants exhibited these 

 peculiarities. In our green-houses the Begonia, which has male 

 and female flowers separately on the same plant, some species had 

 an nnnsual preponderance of fertile female flowers; others, as, for 

 instance, Begonia glaucophglla, had never borne a temale flower 

 within his observation. The race of Primroses were famous for 

 an apparent abhorrence of their own pollen, rarely producing 

 any seeds unless the plant had the chance to receive pollen from 

 some other plant; but the Madeira V\\\m-o^e—Frimulainvolu- 

 crata— was a remarkable self-fertilizer, and every flower, appa- 

 rently under the most varied circumstances, produced an immense 

 quantity of seeds. As illustrations of the infertility of some 

 natural" families, Asclepiadii\i and A pocynacea- were quoted. In 

 these we have the common lloya or "Wax plant," the Oleander, 

 the common Silk-weeds, in which thousands of flowers are pro- 

 duced for every one that results in a seed vessel. In this part of 

 the world at least the "Trailing Arbutus" rarelj, if ever, pro- 

 duces i)erfect seed.

Notice of a New Fauropod. — Mr, J. A. Ryder described a new 

 m3'riapod whicli he had recently discovered, and which tnriied 

 ont to be nearly allied to the form described by Sir John Lnbbock 

 under the name of Fau?-opus. The specimens which the speaker 

 had obtained were live in number, and had but six seumt-nts, fewer 

 than any other known member of the group, whilst the number of 

 pairs of legs was nine, the same as in Pain-opus, which is very 

 strong evidence that the specimens are adults. The following 

 characterization of tlie genus and species was proposed: — 



Euri/pauropus spinusus, gen. et sp. nov. Body segments six 

 in number, sixth exceedingly rudimentar}' ; antenna} five-jointed; 

 legs in nine pairs, equidistant; tergal sclerites laterally expanded 

 80 as to conceal the legs almost entirely when the animal is viewed 

 from al)ove, and covered with fine tubercles vvliieh are joined to 

 each otlier by raised lines ; a|)pressed curved spines are also scat- 

 tered over their surface in less iiuml)er, and also fringe their mar- 

 gins, being disposal at regular intervals; the spines alid lines 

 give the dorsal surface of the little creature a slightly silk^^ lustre 

 when viewed with reflected light. Color a delicate light I»rowM. 

 Muuth-organs the same as in the first-descril)e(l genus, No evi- 

 dence of eyes could be detected. Length ^^^th of an incii ; width 

 about 7\,th of an inch. Habitat in l-'airmount Park, Pliilatlel- 

 phia, east and west of Schuylkill, under decaying wood. 



The tergal sclerites are much thicker than in Pauropus, having 

 the characteristic brown color of chitin when viewed with trans- 

 mitted light. The anlenme have the terminal globular hyaline 

 body with a long pedicle as in Paiiropu>i peclnnculatus. The type 

 is the most distinct form discovered since the detection of tlie 

 first known representatives in Kngland in iSCii, and also extends 

 the geogr.iphical range of the family, and does much towards fully 

 eslaltlishing the Pauropoda as a distinct oriler of myriapods. 



Do Sunken Swallow their Yoinig? — Mr. Mekiian remarked that 

 European zoologists yet seemed incredulous that young snakes 

 would enter their motlieis' mouths for protection when Irightened. 

 He lia<l witnessed such an occurrence, but it had been suggested 

 that his eyes deceived him. Professor Rrown (Jooile had collected 

 evidence sullicient, he thought, for American zoologists to believe 

 in. Similar facts came to us from Australia. He read a part of a 

 letter to himself from Raron Perilinand Vun Mueller, of Mel- 




140 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



bourne, statino^ that two oljservers, wljom Dr. M. believefl perfectly 

 credible, had, independently of each other, witnessed similar pro- 

 tection in tiiat country. 



Dr. Kenderdine said he had personally seen a case where a garter 

 snake so protected its young. 



Hlocle of Depositing Ant-egg:^ — Mr. McCook stated that a queen 

 of the biack carpenter ant, Camponotus Fennsyloanicus^ wliich 

 had long been kept in an artificial nest, had once Iteen seen in the 

 act of depositing an egg. The queen was at tlie time clinging to 

 the side of a hollow in the surface of the earth, almost in a verti- 

 cal position. The usual body-guard of workers quite surrounded 

 her, continually touching her with their antennne. The egg was a 

 wliite cylindrical object, about one-eighth of an inch in length. It 

 was about two minutes in escaping from tlie bod}', and as soon as 

 dropped was carried below wiihin the galleries by a worker. The 

 queen was never left by her l>od3'-guard, who sought to control 

 her movements by pressing" around her, blocking up the i)atli 

 wiiich she wished to take. Frequently more vigorous persuasions 

 were used, an antenna or leg being grasi)ed by a worker, and the 

 queen thus pulled backward. She made no attacks upon her guard, 

 but often stubbornly held her own way; though commonly yield- 

 ing more or less graciously to her attendants. This colony had 

 l)een received from the Alleghenv Moinitains in December, within 

 their formicary in an oak bough, in which they were hil)ernating, 

 being quite stiff with cold. Tliey immediately revived in the 

 warmth, and were healthy and active during the following spring. 

 The queen survived until September following, and would doubt- 

 less have lived longer had she not been neglected during a pro- 

 longed absence in summer. She outlived all her subjects, and was 

 cerlainl}' more than a year old.

Note on the Marriage-fliqhts of Lasivs flnvui^ and Myrmica 

 Johricornis. — Rev. H. C. McCooK remarked that the first named 

 ant is one of the most familiar objects in nature. Its small 

 dusky -yellow workers ma}' be seen in every American lawn, walk, 

 field, and yard, throwing up its fragile moundlets of sand-pellets, 

 and swarming upon jjarticles of fruit, crumbs, bones, dead insects, 

 and all manner of sweets. It is quite cosmopolitan in its distri- 

 bution, and is well known in Europe. The following observation 

 of the annual marriage-flight of the sexes was made September 5, 

 18T8, in the vicinity of riiiladelphia. The nests observed were 




1870.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PrilLADELPIIIA. 1 -} 1 



located (liiectly in and on the fjrassy border of a tro(Mon |.alli in 

 a farmvard. At 4 T. M tiie males and females were seen eominjr 

 out and re-entering the gate, amid great excitement on the part o( 

 the workers. The females parlicularly were followed by Avorkers 

 who '-teased" them occasionally by gently nipping them with tiieir 

 mandibles. The flight of the young queens was, with few excep- 

 tions, made from the top of stalks of grass, where they clung for 

 several minutes, poising themselves, spreading their win«rs,^ind 

 swaying up and <lown. Even to these elevations the worker^ fol- 

 lowed them, hastening their flight by occasional " nips." When 

 the queen rose in flight, there was iio evidence of feebleness or 

 inexperience, except, in some cases, a slight tendency to a z'l^r.za^ 

 course for the first few yards. The flight was then, and in most 

 cases from the very first also, strong and in a strai<-ht course. The 

 insect first rose to a height of about 20 feet, which was soon in- 

 creased to 40, 50, and even GO feet (estimated), and this latter 

 height was maintained until the form was lost to sight. He was 

 able to follow the ants in several instances to a dist'ance of more 

 than 300 feet, before they disa|)peared, at whicij time thev nave 

 no sign of alighting. Some were seen to alight at the dist.-int'M' of 

 fiO and SO feet; others flew iiito a large buttonwood tree within 

 30 feet of the nest. 



The flight was in every case solitary, and was in all directions, 

 although generally in the direction of tlie breeze. The males 

 were in the mean time continually taking fligiit, urged thereto ]>y 

 teasing workers, each separately, and whollv''inde|)endent of otluM- 

 males and of the females, as to the time and direction of flight. 

 This fact led Mr. McCook to infer that the pairing of the se~xes 

 must have occurred within the nest before departTire therefrom. 

 Exccjit in the case of those individuals who lit upon the button- 

 wood tree, there appeared no opportunity for a meeting after 

 flight. There was nothing in all the facts" to suggest the Idea of 

 a future consort. The same feature of independent and solitary 

 flight of the sexes had been oi)served in tiie swarming of the Shin- 

 ing Slave-maker Po/i/crfjii.s luciilus. This is in marked contrast 

 with tlie habit of some other ants as illustrated in an observation 

 subsequently given. 



Before taking flight the L. flacus females spent some time in 

 combing and cleansing themselves. A female was j)huvd among 

 the workers of another nest not more than a yanl distant from her 

 own, in order to test the treatment of an alien. She was imm.-di 

 ately attacked fiercely, an<l would no doubt have been soon killed 

 had she n(.t been r.-moved. In two formicaries from which the 

 above marriage-flight occurred, it was observed that the doors 

 were dosed about 4'. V .M.by bits of dry grass and pellets of soil. 

 They so remaine<l during the night, or at least were found closed 

 in the morning. Three days thereafter several males were foun-l 

 nestled under a chip by the roadside. As soon as the chip was 




142 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1879. 



turned np, two of these were seized by a couple of prowlinij ants 

 of the species Tetramorium caespitum and Formica SfhavJf'usHi^ 

 and carried off as prey, a suggestion of the con)mon fate of emmet 

 masculines. 



His attention had been called to an article in a Hollidaysburg 

 (Pennsylvania) journal, which reported a remarkable swarm of ants 

 that had crossed that town on the 13th September, 1876. He im- 

 mediately wrote to Rev. D. H. Barron, a citizen of the place, and 

 a gentleman of intelligence and prudence, giving certain points 

 which it was desirable to ascertain. The ants in the course of 

 their flight had come in contact with the mechanics at work upon 

 the tower of the new court-house, whom it was reported tliey 

 had assaulted vigorously. Mr. Barron visited these men, and 

 after a careful interview communicated the following facts : The 

 flight actually occurred substantial!}^ as reported ; the day was 

 clear, warm, and calm; the ants came between 10 and 11 A.M., 

 from the direction of the Cliimne}' Rocks, a ridge of the mountain 

 on the southeast of the town. As to numbers, the answers of the 

 men were as follows: "so thick 3"ou could hardly see through 

 them;" '"swarms;" "about 30,000!" The ants struck the build- 

 ing at the height of al)out 120 or 125 feet, and certainl}' assaulted 

 the men. Whether the attack was a bite or a sting they could not 

 tell, l)ut it was something very uncomfortable, and they would not 

 like to have it repeated. The ants were of two sizes, some larger 

 some smaller. One of the men had saved some specimens which 

 were sent to Mr. McCook and proved to be the males and females 

 of Myrmica lobricoi'nis, Nylander. These ants can inflict a pain- 

 ful sting, but probably attacked the workmen simply in self- 

 defence ; that is, the men happened to obstruct their flight, and 

 naturally vigorously brushed oft" the insects who lit upon them, 

 who in turn becoming irate applied their stings. Such a vast horde 

 as this swarm contained must have been composed of the winged 

 inmates of many formicaries on the mountain side. This is quite 

 in contrast with the solitary flight of Lasius Jlavus as described 

 in a former note. The pairing of the sexes was probably in the 

 air, or atter alighting, as in the case of the agricultural ant.' Mr. 

 McCook liad taken ants of the same sub-family Mijrmicidae^yvhile 

 they were in the act of pairing in the air. 



In connection with the above notes on the queen-life of ants, 

 he presented an f)bservation rejiorted to him bj' Mr. Jos. Wilcox. 

 This gentleman had seen a colony of some species of Camj)ono- 

 tus occui)ying a larsfe dead Cyprus tree standing in the midst of 

 a Cyprus swamp in Florida, at least 600 feet from the shore. The 

 tree was wholly isolated from the land and from all surrounding 

 vegetation except another fallen Cyprus tree which leaned up 

 against it. Evidently a fertilized queen had at some time flown 

 from the land to this tree, where she had established the colony.

Tlie fact is interesting as indicating the origin of formicaries from 

 single queens, as myrmecologists have supposed to be fr('([uently 

 if not commonly the case. Further, as showing the ability of a 

 large number of ants (this nest was reported to consist of vast 

 numbers) to maintain active life under quite circumscribed environ- 

 ment. The insects sheltered iii such numi)ers b}' old trees ma}' 

 have furnished a large portion of the food supply. The speci- 

 mens brought b\' Mr. Wilcox were taken from a colony on the 

 land, which lie supposed to be identical with the swamp-tree nest, 

 and were examples of Camponolus esuriens, Smith.

NOTES ON THE AMPHIUMA. 

 BY HENRY C. CHAPMAN, M.D. 



On looking over general works, like those of Owen, Huxley, 

 Milne Edwards, Gegenbanr, Stanniiis, etc., in reference to the 

 anatom}' of the Perrenibranchiate Balrachia, I find that the Am- 

 phiuma is only referred to in a general way, an<l, with the excep- 

 tion of Cuvier's memoir,' I do not know of any special paper 

 having been published on the structure of that animal. Having 

 dissected the Amphiuma that recentlv died at the Zoological Gar- 

 den, I thought that it might not be uninteresting to notice tlie 

 disposition of its internal organs. The specimen was a male, and 

 measured twenty-nine inches. As regards the alimentary canal, 

 the only difference that I noticed in m}' specimen, as compared 

 with that described by Cuvier, was tiiat the rectum did not ex- 

 hibit the constrictions seen in the figure of his specimen. In other 

 respects, such as the longitudinal folds of the stomach, the open- 

 ings into the cloaca, etc., they were alike. The liver and spleen 

 were large, and there was a distinct pancreas. The lungs were 

 well developed, and attained a length of thirteen inches, which 

 may serve to explain the fact of the animal being able to remain 

 under water such a length of time. The heart differs from that 

 of the siren in that the auricles are not fringed to the same ex- 

 tent. The ventricle is large and muscular, and is separated from 

 the l»ull)us arteriosus b}' a short and narrow constriction. Tlie 

 bulbus bifurcates each- branch at once, then subdivides into the 

 pulmonary artery and a branchial vessel. The latter winds around 

 the pharynx, and, meeting its fellow of the opposite side, the two 

 form the aorta. From the branchial vessel are given off cephalic 

 and hyoid branches. The blood is returned from the lung to the 

 heart by a pulmonary vein. As compared with Siredon, Meno- 

 braiichus, Siren, P?^oteus, and even with the closely allied Meno- 

 pan, a, Amphiuma exhibits a very simple and concentrated type of 

 circulation. I did not notice anything peculiar about the branches 

 given off by the aorta, which I examined through its length; the 

 vessels supplying the Wolffian bodies were large. The bladder

1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 145 



was long ami narrow, measuring nine inches: it opened into tlie 

 cloaca. I can only account for the great length of the bladder in 

 the Amphiumn and Sifen on the supposition that it represents a 

 sort of rudimentary allantois. This view is strengthened Iw the 

 fact of the Amphiumn having very simple limbs, and in this 

 respect also foreshadowing higher types of life. The uro-geijital 

 apparatus in its general arrangement resembles that of the newt 

 {Triton tienialus). The testicle, however, was undivided, and 

 measured five and a half inches in length; it was situated in the 

 posterior third of the bod}- cavity. From the testicle six or seven 

 efferent ducts pass transversely outward to the remains of the 

 upper part of the Wolffian body, represented by a chain of dilata- 

 tions. From this embryonic remnant pass about twelve tubes into 

 a common uro-genital duct, wliich measures nine inches. This 

 duct runs in a wavy course until it reaches the lower part of the 

 Wolffian body, or the so-called kidne}-. Here the duct becomes 

 straight, and lies on the outside of the Wolftian body, from which 

 it collects, through small tubes, the urine. This common uro- 

 genital duct opens into the cloaca posteriorly to the bladder. I 

 was able b}- pressing upon the duct to squeeze a considerable 

 amount of semen through its opening into the cloaca, which gave 

 me the opportunity of examining the spermatozoa. These bodies 

 did not exhibit a very well defined head, but one end was obtuse 

 and the other tapered off tail-like. Just between the cloaca and 

 abdominal wall I found coiled up a nematoid worm, which may 

 be the Axcaris unguiculala. I found what seemed to be also the 

 same worm in an encysted condition in the intestine and in the 

 niesenterv.

PLACENTA OF MACACUS CYNOMOLOGUS. 

 BY HENRY C. CHAPMAN, M.D. 



CifJinpaiatively little is known concerning the foetal condition of 

 monkeys. In those of the New World (Platyrhina) tlie placenta 

 is single. As regards the Anthropoids the placentation in the 

 Gorilla and Oui-ang is unknown; in the Chimpanzee tlie organ is 

 single ; in the Hylobates it is double. In the remaining Old World 

 raonkej'S (Catarhina) the placenta is usually described as being 

 double. Thus Prof. Owen observes, "in the tailed Catarhina the 

 placenta is double, the two being distinct and. apart. "^ According 

 to Prof. Milne Edwards, "chez les ^autres singes de Tancien con- 

 tinent cet organe est divise en deux lobes bien distincts."' Prof, 

 Huxley states, " that the placenta is often bilobed."^ In the genera 

 Nasalis, Semnopithecus, Cercopithecus, according to Breschet,* 

 and in the Macacus nemestrinus, according to Prof. RoUeston,* 

 the placenta is double. In the case of the 3[acacus nemesb'inus 

 I have confirmed Prof. Rolleston's observation in two instances- 

 Having recently made a post-mortem examination of a pregnant 

 Macacus ct/nomolgus, which died at the Philadelphia Zoological 

 Garden, of phthisis, I was surprised to find on op ning the uterus 

 that tlie placenta was single, contrar}' to what might have been 

 expected. As the opportunity rarely presents itself of examining 

 in situ the fa'tus and membranes of a monkey, it appears to me 

 proper to communicate the results of m\' dissection. In opening 

 the uterus I found that it measured from side to side 7 inches, 

 and was |th inch thick. The placenta, single and discoid in form, 

 measured 3^ inches in its longest diameter, and 2| inches in its 

 shortest. The umbilical cord was 7 inches in length and consisted 

 of the umbilical vein and the two hypogastric arteries. The um- 

 bilical vein passed into the liver of the foetus, and the h3'pogastric 

 arteries into the internal iliacs. The foetus measured, from crown 

 of head to tail, G| inches, the tail itself measuring 7 inches. In

reference to tlie membranes, the amnion and chorion adhered 

 together and were in contact with the decidna. As the prcirnancy 

 was far advanced, I cannot state whether there was a decidna re- 

 flexa, at least it was nndistinguishable from the deci<lna vwa. In 

 every respect the disposition of all the parts strikingly resembled 

 those of the human being under similar conditions.

DESCRIPTION OF A NEW SPECIES OF CHIROCEPHALTIS. 

 BY JOHN A. RYDER. 



Tiie genus Chirocephalvs does not seem to have been noticed 

 up to the present time in North America; I therefore take much 

 pleasure in announcing the discovery of a hitherto undescribed 

 species of the genus in the vicinit}' of Woodbury-, New Jerse}', 

 where it was found in abundance in the ditches by Mr. W. P. Seal, 

 a resident of the place, and an indefatigable collector of the minute 

 life of his neighborliood. 



The genus, as characterized by Dr. Wm. Baird,' has been found 

 in Switzerland, France, England, Russia, and Siberia. The species 

 C. lacunse^ most nearly like the one I am about to describe, is 

 figured and described by Guerin in bis Iconog. Regne Animale^ as 

 being found at Fontainebleau, France. The diflerences between 

 our species and Guerin's are, however, sufficientlj' striking and 

 constant to characterize a well-marked specific type, and I accord- 

 ingly propose the following specific characterization of the Ameri- 

 can form. 



Chirocephalus holmanii, nov. sp. 



Char, specif. — Claspers moderately robust ; second j(jint forked, 

 longest branch longer than first joint, and curved inwards, its tip 

 crossing that of its fellow of the opi)Osite side when in repose ; 

 shorter branch less curved, slightly swollen, and rough on the 

 inner surface of its tip, about half as long as the longer branch. 

 Two long fleshy proboscis-like prehensile organs arise from the 

 bases of the claspers and are coiled up between the latter; mus- 

 cular fibres pass througliout their length; near their origin and 

 for the first third they are expanded inferiorl}' into a tiiin margin 

 with about seven papilliform processes; they tlien gradually con- 

 tract, becoming C3'lindrical at their second third, where about 

 seven well-marked digitiform processes are found, the longest of 

 which are about as long as twice the diameter of the proboscis at 

 this point; the remaining third gradually contracts, and is thickly 

 studded with half rings of small papilUie which seem to mark

 Total length 12-14 mm. Habitat, Woodbur\-, New Jersey. 



Head of male with proboscidiform organs uncoiled, from the side. Same, viewed from 

 before, with ]>robosciiliform organs coiled up and retracted between the daspers. Head of 

 female from above 



I name the above species in honor of Mr. D. S. Holman, Actu- 

 ar}' of llie Franklin Institute, in recognition of the services he lias 

 rendered in devising methods for studying living objects, both 

 large and small, under the microscope, and to whom I am also in- 

 delHed for the specimens from which the above description has 

 been taken. 



The detection of a member of the genus in this country is very 

 interesting, but less so than the detection of Pauropus huxleyi 

 Lubbock, in the vicinity of Philadelphia, without any ditierence, as 

 far as Mr. Lubbock's excellent plates of English specimens would 

 enable one to judge, that would make it even a variety, although 

 removed by more than 3000 miles of ocean from its congeners. 

 It has been suggested, however, tliat, inasmuch as Philadelphia is 

 an old Elnglish settlement, Pauropus may have been introduced, 

 but in the case of Chirocephalus such an exi^lanation is less open 

 to acceptance.

Pnirinrj of Spiders^ Linyphia marginafn. — Rev. H. C. McCoOK 

 remarked tlaat on the afternoon of .Tune 14, 1878, he witnessed 

 the pairing of a male and female of Linyphia marginata at Bell- 

 wood, Blair Co., Penna. The spiders were first observed at a 

 quarter before 4 o'clock P. M. They were hanging inverted in 

 the dome-shaped nest of the species, in line with each other, and 

 about three quarters inch apart. Eacli hung within a smaller 

 dome, delicately but perceptibly defined, that rose within the 

 summit. These were perhaps formed b}' the outspread feet draw- 

 ing down tlie inner surface of tlie dome 



The position of tiiese individuals seeming to indicate the act 

 of copulati(jn, he arranged himself before them as comfortably as 

 possible for observation. The nest was hung from the lower sur- 

 face of an end of a plank that jutted over from a pile of lumber, 

 about two and a half feet from the ground, so that, seated before 

 the nest, his face was on a level with the spiders. The male 

 reached out one foot cautiously -toward the female, pulling upon 

 the threads. He turned a moment to adjust tlie block on which 

 he sat, and, on again looking, the two were in embrace. The 

 female was suspended in the same position as before, altliough 

 turned at right angles to the line on which she hung when first 

 seen. The head of the male was laid against the sternum of the 

 female, the abdomen inclined a little upwanl, the forelegs inter- 

 locked with or rather interlaid upon those of the female. Both 

 spiders were suspended by threads, in the normal way. This was 

 at 9 minutes before 4 P. M. After a moment's embrace the pair 

 separated; the female made a circuit of the lower part of the 

 dome, moving in an excited, jerking manner, tlien returned to the 

 summit. The male approached, the female stretching out her 

 forelegs somewhat, as lie laid his two forelegs within tliem. which 

 position was maintained, as was the relative position of the two 

 during the entire period of copulation. The female during the 

 act remained perfectly motionless except an occasional twitching 

 of the apex of the abdomen. 



Tlie two terminal bulbs upon the male palp were laid upon the 

 epigynuin of the female, and pressed downward. From one of 

 these issued the sac, a ltean-shai)ed organ, of a bright amber color, 

 and translucent, which slioJie brilliantly in the sun that fell full 

 upon it from the west. It remained thus projected, held between 

 the finger-like tufted horn of thfe bulb, for a brief space, was then

gradually contracted and withdrawn wjthin the black corneous 

 bulb, wliicli was meanwhile pressed eagerh* against the epiiiynum. 

 A small elbow or projection upon the upper part of the bulb 

 seemed to press witliin the speruiatiieca of tiie epigynura. The 

 two bulbs were laid simultaneously upon the tubes of tlie sperraa- 

 thecse, but the intlated sac api)eared in but one bulb at a time : 

 the latter action alternated in the bulb. There was a prolonged 

 squeezing motion of the bulbs, as though pressing into the sper- 

 mathecte, and at times a corresponding motion in the abdomen 

 of the female, especially at tiie apex. With this exception the 

 female remained motionless during tlie whole period of copulation. 

 After application as above tlie male bull) was slowly, for ihe most 

 part, but sometimes rapidly, raised, bent upward, and apparently 

 clasped upon the falces or lower margin of the face, which jjarts 

 of course were upwaid. Three or four movements back and forth 

 in this clinched position followed, when the series of motions 

 above described was repeated. 



In the meanwhile the other bulb remained upon the other tube 

 until the first bulb began to descend, when it in turn was elevated, 

 and the same motion made. As the bulb descended the sac began 

 to inflate and issue. Tlie above is the process as it was quite 

 regularly repeated. Sometimes, however, both bulbs were clinched 

 upon the falces at the same time; sometimes the movements of 

 the bulb were more rapid than at others. The bulbs had the 

 appearance of having been moistened by some secretion, present- 

 ing the peculiar gloss which a colorless liquid gives to a black 

 surface, but he could see no secretion otherwise, although he was 

 able at any time to use his pocket lens with the exercise of a little 

 care. 



At twenty minutes before 6 six. o'clock he was compelled to 

 leave, at which time the pair had been in embrace one liour and 

 forty-nine minutes. At six o'clock twenty-eightminutes he returned, 

 and fofind the i^air in jnecisely the same positions. He remained 

 five minutes, and then left an intelligent young man at the post, 

 with full instructions as to points of observation. He reported 

 that at thirteen and a half minutes to seven P. M. the pair parted 

 very suddenly. The male ran downward to a portion in tlie lower 

 margin of the dome pursued by the female, who stopped suddenly 

 just above and turned back to the central point in the summit of 

 the dome. JShortly after receiving this report Mr. McCook visited 

 the nest antl !ound tlie female suspended motionless in this i)osi- 

 tion and the male at the point to which he had fled, feeiling upon a 

 small fly. The next morning at seven o'clock the female was in the 

 same position, and the male had disappeared. He attenipted to 

 capture the female, but she ran among the boards and escaped. 

 The pair had thus been in union two hours and fifty-five and a 

 half minutes. 



During this period thej* were separated a number of times. 




152 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



Nineteen of these interruptions were noted; one was caused by a 

 small fly striking the snare, which the male darted at in a fierce 

 manner, but failed to seize, as the fly broke loose before he reached 

 it. Others were caused by the observer touching the foundation 

 threads or other parts of the nest. Toward the close of his ob- 

 servations he accidentia' broke tiie suspending lines nearest to 

 him and so caused one side of the dome to fall in. This made 

 only a momentar}- interruption. Man}^ of these separations were, 

 however, apparently without any extraneous cause. Twice the 

 male ran to one side of the dome, made a web attachment to a 

 bit of leaf hanging in the snare, drew out a thread about two and 

 a half inches long, which he overlaid a couple of times, and then 

 made the following motion : First, the body was placed erect, i.e., 

 back upward, and was moved back and forth along the line, rub- 

 bing the points or " nippers" of the palps at the same time ; then 

 the spider swung over until the body made an angle of about 45° 

 with the line, and while holding on thus the pali)S were ruhbed 

 l)ack and forth alternately along the line as before. Tiie process 

 was repeated during another of the intermissions, as described 

 above. It was conjectured that the purpose of this movement 

 might be the distribution of the seminal fluid into the palpal 

 bulbs. This is taken up by the sacs, by the inflation and contrac- 

 tion of whose membranous coats it is forced into the spermathecae 

 of the female.

The Lateral Sensory Apparatus of Fishes. — Dr. Francis Der- 

 CUM called the attention of the Academ3^ to the so-called mucous 

 canals, or system of the lateral line in fishes. Up to the year 

 1850 these structures had been regarded as glandular, that is, as 

 secreting mucus for the purpose of lubricating the general surface 

 of the body. However, the following facts at once strike us as 

 being directly contradictory to this view. In the first place, their 

 size would render them wholly insufticient; secondly, tliese canals 

 are in most fishes practically closed ; and in some fishes actually 

 closed along their entire course. Again, in moUusks in which the 

 surface is equall}' well lubricated with those of fishes we find no 

 such structures. 



After referring to the discoveries of Franz Leydig in 1850, and 

 afterwards to the observations of F. E. Schulze on 3'oung teliost 

 fishes. Dr. Dercum off"ered the following evidence in confirmation 

 of the view that these structures are sensory. Like Le^'dig he 

 described as occurring at regular intervals in the canals of the 

 head and lateral line certain discoidal bodies, termed by Lejdig 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 153 



nerve-buttons, and in wliicli terminates a nerve fibre. Tic corrobo- 

 rated Leydig's statements regarding tlie existence of a little mass 

 of viscid mucous or jolly-like matter resting on eacii disk, and also 

 regarding the posititms of the disks. ?. e , as generally occurring 

 under small bridges of bone in the canals of the head, and as 

 occurring in every scale of the lateral line. However, the speci- 

 mens exliibiled by him showed a result entirel}- ditferent from tiiat 

 of Leydig as regards the distrilmtion of tlie nerves. Leydig 

 pictures tiie disk as composed of two distinct areas, a dark or 

 less translucent central ))ortion, and a lighter [>eri[iheral portion. 

 This appearance is, indeed, simulated in the fresh preparation, as 

 the disk is somewhat transparent, and allows the insertion of the 

 nerve fibre to be seen directly througli it. No such appearance, 

 however, is presented in specimens treated l)V osmic acid. A 

 dense, arborescent plexus of nerve-fibres comes into view, and the 

 distinction into two areas entirely disappears. 



The size of the entering nerve as compared with the size of tlie 

 disk is relatively very great, so tliat when the dense plexus uf 

 nerves makes its appearance it strikes one as though the bulk of 

 the disk were nerve matter. Indeed, besides a large number of 

 capillaries it contains (m]y a small amount of connective tissue. 



Owing to the want of the proper material, Dr. Dercum had not 

 been able to confirm the oljservations of F. E. Sciiulze on young 

 fishes. However, transverse sections of the disks macerated in 

 osmic acid and teased, yielded essentially the same results as re- 

 gards the structure of the epithelium. TIiis appears to consist of 

 two kinds of cells, one long and cylindroid, the other small and 

 globose or ])3riform. and having long outrunners penetrating the 

 sul>jacent connective tissue. These outrunners are probably 

 continuous with nerve-fibres, which tliey resemble. The drawings 

 representing the connections c>f tiie nerves witi» tiie cells, given l>y 

 F. K. Schulze for the " nerve-hills" of young fisties, are, therefore, 

 ver3' probably correct, but tiie material at hand did not i)ermit an 

 absolute decision of the point. The hairs of these perceptive cells 

 were readily distinguished, but were generally broken and muti- 

 lated, owing doubtless to the reagents and teasing. 



As is well known, the canals of the head are generally provided 

 with bony supports, which form grooves, and which are at intervals 

 generally bridged over b\- bone. Thus certain membranous inter- 

 spaces of greater or less size are produced. In some fi.shes. as 

 Ccntrojiomus unfh'ciwalis, the bou}- bridges are more or less 

 wanting, so tliat a contparatively large expanse of membrane is 

 forme<l stretched between the two walls of tlie canal. Tht-se 

 membranes are, of course, composed of two elemfuts. They 

 consist, first, of the delicate connective tissue and flattened epi- 

 thelium belonging to the canal, and, secondly, of the dense layer 

 of connective tissue and epithelium belonging to the skin. The 

 two layers can be readily separated by a careful dissection. Kacii

moml)rane, were it stretched tightl}-, would form functionally a 

 druni-liead. It is, however, quite loose, and will fluctuate readily 

 on pressure. 



The function attributed to this apparatus by F. E. Schulze,that 

 these structures ai)preciate mass movements of the water, and 

 also waves having longer periods than those appreciated b^- the 

 ear, is no doubt the correct one. However, tiie canals cannot act 

 in the manner suggested by Schulze, i. e., Iiy allowing the water 

 to flow freely through them, as such a free communication with 

 the surrounding medium as is implied, is not present. As al- 

 ready stated, in some fislies the canals are completel}' closed along 

 their entire course, and when openings are present, they are pro- 

 bably- for the purpose of maintaining an equilibrium of pressure 

 within and without the apparatus. 



The true detailed action of these organs is probably as follows: 

 Let us suppose any disturljing cause to set up a wave of long 

 period in the water. It impinges, first, on the membranous inter- 

 spaces or drum-heads before spoken of, and with tlie greatest in- 

 tensity, of course, on those which are most nearl}' placed at right 

 angles to its direction. The wave is thus communicated to the 

 liquid in the canals, which transmits it to the adjacent masses of 

 jelly-like mucus covering the disks. The quivering of these 

 little masses probabl}- excites and intensifies vibrations of the 

 hairs of the perceptive cells. Tlie fish probably judges of the 

 direction of the disturbing cause b}' the portion of the apparatus 

 most intensely excited. The membranous spaces or drum-heads, 

 when the apparatus is well develo}>ed, are so arranged as to favor 

 the perception of vibrations from almost all directions. 



Dr. Dercum suggested that it would be well, in view of the con- 

 fusion existing in the present names* of the dermal structures of 

 fishes, to call these organs definitely the lateral sensory apparatus 

 of fishes. This would, of course, not include the sensor}- ampullse 

 of the sharks and rays, nor the Saviau vesicles, which have al- 

 ready distinctive names. In view of the structural resem])lance 

 of the sensory disks to the macuhe acustica.', he proposed to call 

 them the maculae laterales, giving a specific signification to the 

 word macula.

Note on Mound-making Ants. — Mr. McCooK said that he had 

 had an opportunity to spend a day (June 12) on the Allegheny 

 Mountains, above Birmingham, Huntingdon Co., Pa., observing 

 the habits of Formica exsectoiiles, our mountain mound-builder. 

 While standing near a yellow i)ine tree whose roots ran into a 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 155 



Iniiio double iiKnind, his attention was attracted l\v a continuous 

 ami i)eculiar rasping sound. This was produced J»y ants who were 

 scattered over the surface of the trunk engage<l in scooping out 

 with their niandihles the l»ark tiirreof. Tlie gray outer hark had 

 }>een removed in many places, and the reddish-l)rown bark beneath 

 cut away so as to give the tree a marked sp'>tted appearance, 

 Tlie excavatetl portions covered a surface at times of two or three 

 square inches, and were fiom one-sixteenth to one-eighth of an inch 

 in depth. The pellets were sometimes allowed to accumulate in 

 the mandibles, but were generally rejected as soon as cut off, 

 an<l drop|ie<l to the earth. In only two cases was there any ap|)li- 

 cation of the tongue to the bark. No other tree was observed to 

 lie tlius marked. The purpose of this curious behavior could not 

 lie conjectured. 



The directness with which the foragers take the home path was 

 thus illustrateil. One worker was seen by his compaidon. Mr. 

 Kay, to seize a small green insect, with which she immediate!}' 

 turned homeward. She was followed patiently with her burden 

 to the nest, a distance of 126 feet, and her path ujjon measure- 

 ment was found to be a direct line. She was twice attacked upon 

 the route, once by several workers of the same species; she hid 

 from these assailants beneath a leaf and waited until they dis- 

 persed. The second time she was assaidted by two workers from 

 whom she escaped by running. Once she reste<l for one half a 

 minute. A numlier of times she met foragers apparently of her own 

 nest, for after antennal salutations she passed peacefully on. The 

 tlirect line was in no case interrupted. 



In turning up a number of stones in the neighborhood of various 

 mounds, hosts of white ants, Tennes Jlavipes^ were uncovered, who 

 were instantly attacked b}' the roving exsectoides, and carried 

 off in their jaws. These termites evidently are preyed upon by 

 the mound builders, ^>ests of small true ants, exposed in a simi- 

 lar way, were similarly dealt with. 



A great number ol abandoned and moss-grown mounds were 

 seen here. In some cases, one part of the hill was occupied and 

 the other abainloned. In the unoccupied parts when wa»hc<l out 

 by the rains, ihe exposed walls of the galleries presi-ntefl a pretty 

 columnar api)earance, which was made more striking by the over- 

 covering moss. 



As the evening advanced attcntirui was directed to the gates to 

 note if any attempt would be made to close them. I'reviotis stu- 

 dies, ma<le later in the summer, had failed to tletect any stu-li 

 effort. Five doors nf)t far removed from each other upon the side 

 of a large mound, were put umler close observation, Tiicsc were 

 watched until the night wxs loo far advanceil to allow further 

 nf>tice, at wiiich time, three doors were <piite closed and tw«> 

 nearly so. There appeared to he acrudlict of )M'havior on the part 

 of the workers, some carrying the pellets of earth quite out of the 




156 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



galleries as usual, wliile others dropped them uear the mouth or 

 door. The evening was quite cool and Mr. McCook's impression 

 was that tlie ants wlio dropped the pellets within or just outside of 

 the doors were probably caused to do' so b}'' the sense of cold with 

 whicli they were met. Feeling the cold air as they approached 

 the gate, instead of pushing out, they stopped, dropped the pellet, 

 and turned back. Thus the grains accumulated, giving the ap- 

 l^earance of an intentional closing. Through the doors wliicli were 

 nearl}'' closed an ant head and antennae could occasionally be seen 

 peeping forth.

Combats and Nidification of the Pavement Ant, Tetramorium 

 Csespilum. — Mr. McCooK exhibited a large glass jar containing a 

 nest of this ant made by captives taken from a city garden. Dur- 

 ing the month of May immense numbers of this species have been 

 seen along our sidewalks, in j'ards and gardens, engaged in com- 

 bat. From one of these masses of struggling insects, tliree large 

 groups were taken and placed in separate jars. The transfer had 

 no visible effect in separating the combatants. Into one jar (Xo. 

 1) a pellet saturated in cologne was introduced. Instantly, as in 

 the case of experiments previously reported,' the combatants 

 separated, and buried themselves pell-mell in the earth. Not an 



' Mode of Recognition among Ants, Proceed. Acad. Nat. Sci., p. 15, 

 1878.

ant remained above the smftu'C. The pellet was removed, and 

 the jar thoroughly aired; whereupon the ants s[)eedily hegan to 

 reappear. They seemed to be confused somewhat by the fumes 

 of the cologne, but soon began to dig galleries. Onl}' two pairs 

 resumed the figlit,and these shortly unclasped mandibles. There 

 was no resumption of hostilities thereafter, and the two parties 

 appeared to interblend and fraternize complete!}'. 



in the second jar (No. 2), the one exhibited, tlie ants were left 

 undisturbed. The battle continued for two days. It was waged 

 over the entire surface of the earth within the jar. Ever} clod 

 and other elevation was the seat of one or more duels, for, as a 

 general rule, the fight was waged by twos, but also frequently by 

 threes. The duelists seized each other by the head, frequently 

 interclasping mandibles, and jnilling backward or swaying back 

 and forth. Again, one would have her antagonist grasped by the 

 face above the mandibles, which placed the latter at a great dis- 

 advantage. In such cases, and in others also, both ants would be 

 reared ufwn the hind and middle legs, with al)domens turned un- 

 der, and stinging organs thrust out. When three ants were bat- 

 tling in one group, the third commonl}- held her opponent by a 

 leg, or had seized her by the abdomen or thorax. Occasional!}' 

 the exertions of tlie combatants caused them to roll upon the 

 ground. 



At the close of the first day, numbers had retired from the 

 conflict and perchtd upon the sides of the jar. On the third da}' 

 the battle had ceased, and the ants were engaged in excavating 

 galleries. Whether the survivors were all of one party could not 

 be determined, except inferentially by the following experiment. 



The jar wliicli ha<l Ijeen fumed witli cologne (Xo. 1) was intro- 

 duced into jar No. 2. whicli was large enough to admit it. The 

 ants in No. 1, who liad been hostile, were then working togetlier 

 harmoniously. They, in turn, soon interblended with those in 

 No. 2, all thus composing one apparently united formicary. It 

 thus appears, whatever may liave Ijeen the cause of the combat, 

 that, first, the influence of the cologne fumes completely pacified 

 and united the contending parties; and, second, that the previous 

 hostility was no barrier to tlieir forming one harmonious nest. 

 Sul»sequenlly the jar was placed uncovered in the open air and 

 was abandoned by all but a few of the ants within two days. 



There were many dead bodies, which were gathered in one large 

 heaj), that each day was increasetl by the death of the (probably) 

 injiu'ed. This "graveyard" was subsequently clumgcd to another 

 spot, l)ut the dead were kept together as they now are. 



In at least one case noted the cause of the ant battle seemed 

 quite clear. The warring insects were spreail thickly over a sur- 

 face of nearly a square foot of the sulewalk, quite near the curb- 

 stone. The centre of this struggling mass was a quantity of fatty 

 matter whicli had been thrown on and around the seams of the 



\ 




158 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADKMY OF [1879. 



bricks through whicli a hirgo formicary had made its gates. From 

 the battle field a column of ants, three or four lines deep, stretchefl 

 along a depression caused bv a shallow surface drain to a second 

 nest just under a gate that led thrfnigh a wall into the house-yard. 

 Evidently the ants from the curb foj-micar}' had fallen upon the 

 unctuous treasures which had dropped by tlieir doors, but had 

 been disturbed in their "feast of fat things'' 1)v stragglers from 

 the gate nest. The stragglers were attacked ; others came, and in 

 time were attacked ; messengers ran to the gate nest for reinforce- 

 ments; fresh squadrons issued from the curb colony, and thus 

 the battle grew. When it was first seen a single line of ants was 

 stretched from battle ground to gate, and a double line from gate 

 to battle field. The ants in these columns were in the utmost 

 agitation. As they hurried along, fairly a-quiver with excitement, 

 they suggested strongly the outward mien and behavior of human 

 beings running to and from a fire, a riot, or a fight. Mr. McCook 

 was not al)le to watch the issue of this ant i)atlle, but had no 

 doubt that the above is the true theor}' of its origin. It is [)V0- 

 bable that many similar conflicts originate in like rivalries for the 

 possession of food 



The system of galleries excavated by these insects is precise!}' 

 like that of most other mason ants. It is a network of galleries for 

 the most part from one-sixteenth to one-eighth incii wide, but with 

 frequent greatly widened portions. The "meshes" or solid inter- 

 spaces vary much in size. The galleries were made against the 

 inner surface of the jar, and thus are entii'el}' visible, 'fhe ants 

 seemed to have no objection to working in the light. The princi- 

 pal galleries have a tendency' more or less regular to the vertical 

 and horizontal, but the impression was made by the mode of ope- 

 rations that the workers were rather influenced by some accidental 

 feature or quality of the soil, than directed b}* an}' intelligent 

 plan, in lading out and driving the galleries. The behavior of 

 the ants gave to a human observer the impression of unconscious 

 action, not of forethought. On the contrary, a glance at the 

 series of galleries, as thus far completed, shows an arrangement 

 admii'ably suited for the i)urposes of a nest. The cross-galleries 

 are all inclined at various degrees of inclination, leading into 

 each other and out of the surface-gates hy grades which afford 

 easy passage. There is thus a mechanical advantage in the very 

 irreguiarit}' of the arrangement. It is not improbable, to say the 

 least, that the muscular system of the ant is so constructed that 

 she unconsciously takes the line of least action in her work, as do 

 hunian beings and lower animals when climbing the side of a hill, 

 or moving across irregular surfaces. The thorough interlacing of 

 the galleries affords easy intercommunication throughout the 

 nest. There is also an evident convergence of the cross galleries 

 at several points upon vertical galleries which are much widened 

 as though to provide for the convenient movements of increased 

 numbers. 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF IMIILAItELI'HIA. 159 



The structure of a nest in natural site is obviously more dilli- 

 cult to study. For the sake of comparison, one was taken which 

 was located on the edge of a brick walk. The walk was separated 

 from the grass-j)lat by a line of bricks set on edge. Several of 

 these and the adjoining flat bricks were removed, thus quite ex- 

 posing the fomicary to the depth in parts of four inches. Tlie 

 side of the grass-plat against whicii the bricks iiad pressed was 

 pierced by man}- openings, one-quarter of an incli or more in diame- 

 ter, leading for the most |)art directly into ovoid chambers whose 

 longest diameters were from lliree-fourths of an incli to one inch 

 in length. One of the largest of these was close to the surface just 

 beneath the grass roots, and was fdled with naked larvie of worker 

 ants, most of which were white, a few yellow. These chambers 

 had interior openings extending into the earth. They were united 

 together l>v galleries, where their boundaries did not interblend. 

 There was an opening directly upward into the grass, but the 

 main avenue for the carriage of excavatiul earth led downward to 

 the lower edge of the brick, then diagonally upward through the 

 earthen seam of that and the next brick, debouching at the surface 

 and upon the pavement. Openings downward communicated 

 with this avenue, as did also a broad (three-eighths inch) winding 

 track, which followed the under surface of tl»e brick its entire 

 length, and l)eyond. These avenues presented the characteristics 

 of those in the artificial nest, but were larger and not so numerous. 

 The large larva? of several queens were found in the lower ave- 

 nues. 



The behavior of the ants placed in jar Xo. 3 was like that of 

 those in Xo. 2, i. e , the fighting soon ceased, and the work of 

 gallery digging began. Here, also, it could not be determined 

 whether tfie survivors were of one party or of both, but the latter 

 was inferred in view of the experiment which showed the inter- 

 blending of the harmonizeil hostiles of Xo. 1 with the survivors of 

 No. 2. The galleries here were not made against the surface of 

 the glass asin Xo. 2, but were confined apparently to the interior 

 of the earth, which they must haveiiuite honey -combed, as shown 

 by the quantity of pellets brouglit up, and by the numerous open- 

 ings upon tlie surface. 



In this connection Mr. McCook referred to the economy in na- 

 ture of ants b}' contributing to the fertilization of the earth. A 

 comparison between tlie formicaries ftf vari(nis species shows that 

 all the mason ants substantially agree in (at least) suliterraueous 

 nidification. The exam[»le presented of the underground work of 

 Tetrainorium will give some i<lea of the manner in which the 

 earth may be excavated by a single colon}'. In a portion of the 

 exposed surface, which presented less rather than uiorc of the 

 average amount (»f excavation, the gallery surface was measured. 

 "In a space of three scpiare inches there were (approximately) one 

 and nine-sixteenths square inches of gallery surface, or about one- 




160 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



lialf of the measuved space. The galleries were in depth full}' one- 

 eighth of an inch. This will give a nule noti(Mi of the extent to 

 which the underground space occupied by a single colony is exca- 

 vated. 



Another estimate was made of the quantity of earth tlirown out 

 of a nest in the two days succeeding a heav}- rain. The excava- 

 tions brouglit up from the seam of a brick tliat faced a grass plat, 

 and which were spread along a distance of eight inches, were 

 collected and measured. The result showed a solid contents of 

 six cubic inches. This was onl}' a part of the work of a formi- 

 cary in tlie time specified, during only a part of which the ants 

 were engaged in transporting pellets. 



The other factor in the calculation is the number of ants of 

 various species spread over an^- given surface of the earth. Ac- 

 curacy of count would be quite imjjossible; but if one will take 

 pains to observe the number of nests which may be seen in nearly 

 every open tract of country-, he will be surprised at its vastness. 

 In some such rough observations, made in the open field, Mr. 

 McCook had concluded that it would be scarcel}^ possible to dig 

 within an}' square foot of surface without uncovering the formi- 

 car}' of some, often of several, species of ants. There is of 

 course a difference in this respect between soils and sections; 

 but the fact is constant that innumerable myriads of ants are 

 ever3'where located and operating as above described. As re- 

 sults of such labor, y??-,s7, the ground is pulverized and brought in 

 great quantities to the surface, thus making good top soil for the 

 growth of vegetation. The nest by which these remarks were 

 illustrated shows that, insignificant in size as these insects are, 

 the labors of countless hosts through many years are by no means 

 insignificant in this shifting of the soil. Seco7ul, the aeration of 

 the soil, so needful for its productiveness, is thus largely pro- 

 moted. Third, the system of "pores," established by the gal- 

 leries which everywhere perforate the ground, aff'ords, on the one 

 hand, free entrace for the rains into the earth, and, on the other 

 hand, a series of tubes through Avhich, by capillary attraction, 

 the moisture may ascend to the roots of plants. In this geo- 

 graphical province (Philadelphia) perhaps the most numerous 

 species, and therefore the most effective toward the above results, 

 are T. caespitum and Laaiiis Jlavus, both small species, the largest 

 workers being little more than one-eighth of an inch in length. 



The fate of the ants during the late heavy June rains liad some- 

 what occupied Mr. McCook's attention. Where do the little 

 creatures find refuge? or do they find an}' sheltered spot within 

 their nest ? It would seem that the health and safety of the larvae 

 at least must require some protection from the water. JJut he 

 could not satisfy himself that Tiiramoriinn has any such shelters. 

 The pellets of soil brought up after the rains were all damp, and 

 had evidently been reached by the water. The opened formicary 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PEIILADELPHTA. 101 



above referred to showed tliat it had been penetrated, as far as ex- 

 amined, !>}• tlie water, as the soil was thoroughly soaked through. 

 The numerous galleries must give more ready aecess to the rains 

 within formicary boun<ls than elsewhere. The jjoints are of 

 much interest, and are still under examination, but the following 

 suggestic)ns were made: P^irst, the peculiar arrangement of the 

 galleries and chambers indicates that the least exposed portion of 

 the nest is that near the surface, in the parts which do not com- 

 municate directly with the same. Tlie main entrance and exit 

 being remf)ved from this, and penetrating downward and lieneath 

 it, would cause a drainage which, carrying otf the first flood, would 

 leave the upper chambers comparatively safe until the water should 

 fill up the lower spaces and back up to tlie surface rooms. Second, 

 it is probable that the galleries which penetrate downwards may 

 serve the purpose of drainage downward. In heav}- rains, how- 

 ever, neither of the above arrangements would seem to afford am- 

 ple protection. Third, it is therefore probaV)le. and observation 

 and some experiments' appear to point in this direction, that the 

 ants themselves (if not the larv;e) can endure a submersion more 

 or less prolonged with comparative safety. 



Honey Glands on Cafalpa Leaves. — Mr. J. A. Ryder stated at 

 the meeting of the Botanical Section that he had recently observed 

 the presence of a number of large nectar-secreting glands on tlie 

 under side of the leaves of the ccmimon Catalpa bignonioides. 

 These glands are situated in the axils of the veins of the leaf, i. e., 

 where the lateral veins join the midrib. Those nearest the inser- 

 tion of the petiole are largest, whilst toward the apex of the leaf 

 they are smaller. The glandular areas, extending over a consider- 

 al)le axillary space as well as to some extent over the sides r)f the 

 veins, are without hairs, the place of the latter being taken l>y 

 large biscuit-shaped, suit-circular glandular bodies attached to the 

 surface of the leaf much like a button to a piece of cloth, and 

 projecting al>ove the circumjacent epidermis, though at the point 

 where the gland is attached the epidermis is depressed. The ap- 

 pearance is not much unlike that of the circnmvallate papilhe of 

 the base of the human tongue. The glands seemed to be modified 

 Lairs, and in thin vertical sections are seen to be composed of 

 columnar cells arranged around a cavity. The nectar observed in 

 a few instances was perceptibly sweet to the taste, and thrown out 

 in suflicient quantity to be seen as small clear drops in the axils 

 of the veins Ants of both red and black species were seen feed- 

 ing upon this sweet liquid with great avidity.

 men of its vcr}' minute hexagonal larva about one-hundredth of 

 an inch long. It liad three segments, and a very rudimentary 

 fourth one, and was of a pale reddish or lilac color; exceedingly 

 compressed, more so relatively than the adults, and with the 

 antenuffi bifurcate as in the latter. The specimen in life ^vas 

 almost as wide as long. Remains of the shells of ova were also 

 found in a crevice in the same jnece of decayed wood upon which 

 the larva was found, and the adults were seen to get into the 

 same crevice and remain for a day at a time, so that it is fair to 

 infer that they are jn'obably the |)arents of the larva in question. 

 The finding of this larva places the validity of the species beyond 

 question, and also renders it quite certain that six segments is the 

 normal number in the adult. The ease with which these animals 

 bear conGnement for a protracted period gives promise that still 

 other specimens of larvae may be looked for in the same vial in 

 the course of the season.

Fossil Foot Ti-acks of the Anthracite Coal Jfeastn-es. — Prof. 

 Leidv read a letter from Mr. W. Lorenz, Cliief Engineer of the 

 Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Co., referring to the fossil 

 specimen presented this evening by Mr. Wm. D. H. Mason, of 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF P III LAPELPIIIA . 165 



Williamstown, Pa. The specimen is n mass of coal shale, witli 

 foot prints, and waS discovere<l bv the donor at the Ellanj^owan 

 CoUiL-ry, in strata l)etween the Primrose and Manimotli veins, in 

 the Mahanoy coal field. Mr. Lorenz remari<s that it is of especial 

 interest, as the first sj)ecimen of the kind found in the Antiiracite 

 coal field. The Sauropus pj'imaerus of Lea. of wliich the oi"i<^inal 

 specimen is preserved in our museum, was discovered in the um- 

 bral red shale, near Pottsville, belonging to the subcari)oniferous 

 series. 



The specimen before us is an irregidar slab, upwards of a foot 

 long an(i less than half the breadth. The upper surface is obscurely 

 ripi)le marked longitudinally, and is crossed in a slant by seven 

 tracks, wliich are in pairs. exce|)t one in advance on the right. Three 

 only are comi)lete. the others being imperfect. The fnir tracks on 

 the rigiit occupy a line of six inches, and are about an inch and a 

 half apart from those on the left. The tracks ajipcar to be single, that 

 is to say, not produced by fore and hind feet together, and no distinc- 

 tion can be detected between impressions of these. The more per- 

 fect impressions exhibit four widely divergent 

 toes, successivel}' increasing in length from 

 within outwardly, excepting that the fourth 

 toe is slightly shorter than the third. A feeble 

 rounded impression of a sole is visible l)chind 

 the toes. The expanse of the tracks is about 

 an inch. The accompanying outline will give 

 an idea c>f their form, tiiough the sole compara- 

 tively- with the toes is not so distinctly defined. The intervals of 

 the toes appear not to be webbed, or at most are only feebly so. 



The impressions are probably those of an amphibian, and per- 

 haps pertained to some salamandroid animal. 



As it is customary to refer to fossil foot tracks, as representing 

 the animals by which they were made, under distinct names, it 

 would be jjroper to designate the present specimen in the same 

 way. In accordance with its discovery in the Anthracite coal 

 field, and from the colliery in which the specimen was found. Mr. 

 Lorenz sngsests that it sliould l»e called the Anthracopus ellan- 



OOWE.SSIS. 



On Sex iti Caslanea Americana. — Mr. Thomas Mekiian referred 

 to the flowers of the common chestnut, CaManea Amerirnna, and 

 pointed f>nt that the flowers were the products of axillary buds, 

 which, in young trees, would have borne branches. These spikes 

 of male flowers ft-ll off by an articulation in the axils of tlie leaves 

 soon after the flowers were mature, and it was remarkable that in 

 young trees that had not arrived at bearing condition, the buds 

 also fell by an articulation before developing the axillary lu-anch- 

 let. Sometimes the leaves would be considerabi}' advanced before 




16G PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



the disarticulation occurrocl. Cliestmit branches several years 

 old would be found full of these scars where the buds had been ; 

 but never would be found a perfect dormant bud, except at the 

 termination of a branch, after the branch was one year old. There 

 seemed to be whole classes of trees with distinct peculiarities ia 

 this respect. LeguminossK would preserve dormant buds for an 

 indefinite number of years. In G>j)nnucladus^l\\e Kentucky coffee 

 tree, the axillary bud of the one year branch could be found 

 twenty years afterwards just beneatli the bark, in tlie position it 

 first occupied, having in all that time grown just enougli as the 

 tree grew to keep just beneath the surface. The same is true of 

 magnolias. In some, 3'oung branchlets came from the axillary 

 buds the spring following their formation, and continued an ex- 

 istence as weak branchlets for a few yeai's until starved out by 

 the stronger ones, but when they reached a flowering condition 

 tlie whole axillary bud died out with tiie effort of producing 

 flowers. This was well illustrated by some maples. Tliere was a 

 tliird class which produced flowers and also an axillary bud, and 

 these continued alwa3s through life twiggy branching trees, de- 

 pending also on ultimate starvation of the branclilets to keep the 

 supply of main branches witliin bounds. Birciies are good exam- 

 ples of this class. The chestnut seems to be tlie only tree which 

 takes the matter in hand in time, and keeps down a su|)erabund- 

 ance of branchlets b^- a disarticulation of the l)uds themselves, 

 though in arbor vitais, deciduous cypress, and some others, there 

 is a disarticulation of superabundant brandies after they are a year 

 or so old, in this way keeping linaliy but a few main branches to 

 preserve the form and i)erniit of tlie functions of the head of the 

 tree. 



In the growing branch of the flowering chestnut tree the first 

 four or five axillary buds, instead of a branch or futile buds for 

 next spring, produce at once spikes of male flowers. Often the 

 two upi)er axillary buds remain till next spring, to run the chance 

 of being thrown off as a bud, or perchance to make a weak branch- 

 let. After these buds have been formed, a subsidiar}' second 

 growth is formed, and from this renewed growtii another crop of 

 male flowers, at the base of which, if at all, two or three clusters 

 of female flowers appear. The first crop of wholly male flowers 

 disappears without apparently being of any service whatever in re- 

 l)roduction. It is an enormous waste of energy if the fertilization 

 of flowers be the sole end of j)roduction. In each spike there were 

 about fifty clusters, and at least five flowers in each cluster, and 

 tliere were about five of these precocious spikes to each branch 

 that might in the end l)ear two or three fei;iale flowers, or, in round 

 numbers, over one thousand male flowers to one female, and when 

 we remember that half the branches produce only the precocious 

 male flowers, there would be two thousand males to one female, 

 even umler the best circumstances; but, as already noted, the 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 167 



whole mass of flowers which give so nuich charm to a chestnut 

 tree fall ort' witliout any influence whatever on the fruit production 

 of any trees in the vicinity, as the female flowers are not in bloom 

 till these showy early (ines have fallen, and depend on the second 

 crop of male flowers for fertilization. 



For what purpose is this immense mass of bloom with its result- 

 ant pollen created? Mr. Meehan believed that modern teleology 

 based on the selfish idea that acts of each individual are solely 

 for its own good, or the good of its immediate descendants, was 

 wrong. The animal world, in the shape of insects perhaps, or in 

 any other way, could be no more said to be created for the vege- 

 table, as fertilizers of flowers, than were plants for them. It is a 

 popular saying, tiiat mouths were not created before something 

 was prepared to put into them ; and scientifically this might be 

 reduced to the proposition, tliat plants may be made to behave 

 and to produce, for ends hnving no relation wiiatever to their own 

 individual wants, but that all things might be made to work to- 

 getlier in harmony for some universal good. 



Mr. Redfield asked whether it might not be that chestnut woods 

 in more southern latitudes, and with female flowers more advanced, 

 couhl receive the pollen from the j^recocious flowers of these 

 northern trees; and. in view of the accidents liable to such a dis- 

 tant transmission by the winds, nature provided this immense 

 superabundance to make the cross-fertilization more certain? 



Mr. Meehan replied that he could not say ; but if an answer to 

 his questions were to l)e met by any of the i)revailing theories on 

 tlie necessities or utilities of cross-fertilization, he would like to 

 ask what was the use of odor in the event of Mr. Redfield's ques- 

 tion being answered atlirinatively ? The male flowers of the sweet 

 chestnut were remarkably odoriferous. A fair sized l)unch in a room 

 would ffive fragrance to a whole house. Where would be the use of 

 adding this powerful odor to flowers in mere arrangements for 

 cross-fertilization by the aid of winds ?

ON THE GENERA OF FELIDJE AND CANID^. 

 BY E. D. COPE. 



FELID.E. 



The discovery of extinct species from time to time, renders it 

 necessary to re-examine tlie definitions of the families and genera 

 into which living forms naturally fall. We thus learn the charac- 

 ters of their primitive tyijes, and the successive steps through wiiich 

 they passed in attaining their present characteristics. The Felidce 

 are known as that family of Carnivora in which the feet and 

 teeth are tnost specialized for the functions of seizing and lace- 

 rating living prey. The number of living species enumerated by 

 Pr. Gray is sixt^'-four, whicli he throws into a number of genera. 

 The extinct species 3'et known are less numerous, l)ut the}' present 

 a greater variety of structure than the former. Two types or 

 series may be recognized among the genera, namely those repre- 

 sented by the genera Felis and Machcirodus respectivel}'. All of 

 the latter are extinct. 



The greater number of the genera allied to Mac^hrodus are 

 distinguished by the great development of the superior canine 

 teeth, wliose crowns are generally compressed and trenchant. 

 The corresponding |)art of the mandible is expanded downwards 

 so as to furnish a protection to the slender crown from fracture 

 b}^ lateral blows when not in use, but in some of the genera, e. g. 

 ^''imravus^ this flange is not developed The only definition 

 which can be used to distinguish these sections of the family, is 

 found in the angular separation of the anterior and lateral planes 

 of the ramus of the mandible, and this character cannot be ex- 

 pected to remain unaffected by future discovery. Forms will 

 doubtless be found in which the angle is obsolete, and in which 

 the lateral and anterior faces pass gradually into each other. 

 Other characters which distinguish the extinct genera are found 

 in the numbers of molar teeth, and, what has been heretofore 

 neglected, the number of lobes of the molars themselves. 



As regards the existing genera, Dr. Gra^-' has brought out their 



' Catalogue of Carnivorous, Pachydermatous, and Edentate Mammalia 

 in the British Museum. By John Edward Gray, F.R.S., V.P.Z.S., F.L.S., 

 etc. London, 1869. 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PniLADELPHIA. 169 



characters more fully tlian any other author. He points out the 

 fact that in some of the species the oibits are closed behind, 

 and in others open. He first examined into the manner of the 

 contraction and closing of the pupil in the presence of liglit. and 

 pointed out the fact that in the large cats it is always round and 

 appioximates a point in closing, while in the smaller forms the 

 pupil closes as a vertical slit. He sliows that the cats of the 

 former group have the smaller orbits of the cranium, and the lat- 

 ter the larger. Dr. Gray, however, uses other characteristics in 

 the discrimination of the genera, which are, in my estimation, 

 quite inadmissible; as the relative length of the muzzle and of 

 the premaxillary bones; also of the hair on different parts of the 

 body and tail. Such features of proportion are essential as 

 characters of species, but not of genera. In accordance with 

 these views, I have united several of Dr. Gray's divisions into 

 groups, which I call genera, and which repose on some definite 

 structural cliaracters. Thus I combine his Uncia,2'igris, Leo aud 

 Leopardua into a genus fur whicli I employ his name Uncia, as the 

 least objectionable,' after having confirmeil by autopsy the circu- 

 lar character of the pupil. This I was enabled to do through the 

 courtes}' of my friend Arthur E. Brown, Superintendent of the 

 Philadeipliia Zoological Garden, who aided me in examiningthe 

 eyes of these animals both by sunlight and the light of a bull's- 

 eye lantern." The detailed characters of the genera will now be 

 given : —

 an angle.

The successive order of the modifications of structure which 

 define the above genera is not diflicidt to perceive, and it is inter- 

 esting to discover that, as in otiier cases, it coincides with the 

 succession in geologic time. The typical genera Uncia^ Felts, etc., 

 are characterized by great specialization, and it is they which now 

 exist. The oldest found Diniclis, Nimravus, etc.. are the least 

 specialized in most respects, and they disappeared before the close 

 of Miocene time. 



Since one of the special cliaracters of the Fflidae is the reduc- 

 tion in the number of the molar teeth l>y subtraction from both 

 ends of the series, an increased number of these constitutes re- 




174 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



semblance to other families. The genus Dimclis, above defined, 

 has been shown by Leidy to possess two more inferior molars 

 than Felis, or three more than Neofelis and Lynx, as in the 

 Miislelidse. The extinct Pseudselurus and the living Cryptoprocta 

 have but one less molar than Dinictis, lacking the posterior 

 tubercular. Nimravus has the same number of molars as Pseu- 

 deelu7'us, but lacks the first premolar instead of the last true 

 molar. In Eoplopihoneus xiQ first find the number of molars as in 

 the existing genera, viz., Pm. | m. \. Other characters of this 

 genus are, however, of a generalized kind. 



I here recall the statement that the genera of Felidx fall into 

 two series, which are distinguished by the forms of the anterior 

 part of the mandibular rami, and generally by the large size of 

 the canine teeth to which the former are adapted. This distinc- 

 tion appeared earl}' in Miocene, or Oligocene time, in fact in the 

 oldest of the cats of which we have an}' knowledge. The genera 

 with large canines or Machserodontine line were then represented 

 by Dinictis, and the Feline line by Pseudselurus. It is interest- 

 ing to observe that these genera differed from their latest proto- 

 types in the same, wa}', viz.: (1) in the presence of more numer- 

 ous inferior molars ; (2) in the presence of a heel of the inferior 

 sectorial ; (3) in the absence of an anterior cusp of the superior 

 sectorial. In the case of Dinictis one other character of primi- 

 tive carnivora may be noticed, viz.: the absence of the cutting 

 lobes on the posterior edges of the superior and inferior premolars, 

 so distinct in the existing cats. The same feature characterizes 

 the superior premolars of Pseudselurus, but the inferior premolars 

 have the lobes. In the existing Cryptoprocta^ which Gervais has 

 shown to be nearly allied in dentition to Pseudselurus. the lobes 

 are wanting from both jaws, but this genus adds to this primitive 

 character another of modern significance, viz., the presence of 

 the anterior cusp of the superior sectorial. Moreover Crypto- 

 procta has another peculiarity which recalls the genera of the 

 Eocene Creodonta, in the well-developed interior tubercle of the 

 third premolar, a character unknown in Miocene or existing Car- 

 nivora. That genus is evidently, like the Lemuridse, also of Mad- 

 agascar, a remnant of the Eocene Fauna, which once covered most 

 of the earth, and may be regarded as, on the whole, the most 

 primitive of the Felidse, recent and extinct. 



Following the two lines of Felidse already indicated, we attain 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 175 



the same conclusion in both, by the same stages. The primitive 

 form of the ^laehaerodont line represented by Hoplophoneus has 

 its extreme in Eusmilus,, where the second inferior premolar and 

 an incisor tooth are wanting, giving a formula of I. 2, C. 1 ; Pm. 

 1 ; M. 1. In Machaerodus we have the moilern characters of the 

 molars seen in i^e//x, viz., no heel of the inferior sectorial; the 

 superior sectorial with an anterior lobe, and posterior lol^es of the 

 premolars. The extreme of this line is reached in Smilodon^ 

 where the second inferior premolar is one rooted or wantino^. 

 This genus then stands related to Machaerodus, as Eusmilus to 

 Hoplophoneus. In the Feline line i>r(»per, on reaching the exist- 

 ing genera, we have lost the heel of the inferior sectoiial and 

 gained the posterior lobes of the premolars and anterior lobe of 

 the superior sectorial at once. A further modification of the 

 dentition of the superior scries of the recent forms, is seen iu the 

 loss of the first superior premolar in Lynx and Neofelis. Still 

 another, which is one step be3ond what is known in the Machaer- 

 odont line, is the loss of the interior tubercle of the superior 

 sectorial, which characterizes the genus Cynselurus, A superior 

 sectorial tooth having the character of that of this genus was 

 discovered by Dr. Ha3den in the Loup River formation of 

 Nebraska, and was referred to a species by Dr. Leidy under the 

 name of Aelurodon ferox. It was much larger than the C.jubalus. 

 As alread}- remarked, the genera of the Macluerodont line are 

 extinct, and this in spite of the fact -that tliey presented the most 

 perfect weapons of destruction in their canine teeth, from the 

 earliest times. Their other modifications of structure advanced 

 j}ari passu with tiiose of the Feline series, and, among others, 

 the feet presented in the latter forms at least (e. jr., Smilodon 

 necalor, Gew.),the most jjcrfect prehensile power of the lions and 

 tigers of to-da}'. As nothing but the characters of the canine 

 teeth distinguished these from* the typical felines, it is to these 

 that we must look for the cause of their failure to continue. Prof. 

 Flower's suggestioii appears to be a good one, viz. : that the 

 length of these teeth became an inconvenience and a hindrance to 

 their possessors. I think there can be no doul)t that the iiuge 

 canines in the Smilodons must have preventetl the biting off of 

 flesh from large pieces, so as to greatly interfere with feeding, and 

 to keej) llie animals in poor condition. Tiie size of the canines 

 is such as to prevent tlieir use as cutting instruments, excepting

with the mouth closed, for the latter could not have been oj^ened 

 sufficiently to allow any ol)ject to enter it from the front. Even 

 were it opened so far as to allow the mandible to pass behind the 

 apices of the canines, there would appear to be some risk of the 

 latter's becoming caught on tiie point of one or the other canine, 

 and forced to remain open, causing early starvation. Sucli may 

 have been the fate of the fine individual of the *S'. ^eo^yae^.s, Lund, 

 whose skull was found in Brazil by Lund, and which is familiar 

 to us through the figures of Dr. Blainville, etc.

 of the superior tubercular looks partly inwards, is rather long, 

 and has three roots. The superior canine is quite long, and has 

 a reo^ularly lenticular section, without facets. Its anterior and 

 posterior edges are denticulate. The external incisors are much 

 larger than the internal, and have subconic crowns. The crowns 

 of the others are subcuneiform. The inferior canines are consider- 

 ably larger than the incisors. Tlie latter are regular, and do not 

 overlap each other. The second and third inferior premolars

The form of the skull is short and wide ; the z3'gomata arc

CANID.E. 



The range of variation presented by the species of Canidae in- 

 cludes several generic divisions, recent and exlinet. These genera 

 are, however, as clf)sely intergrmled as are those of tlie cats, ami 

 their definite characters are suliject to occasional failure from ab- 




nS PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1879. 



normal variations. These are, however, not so frequent as to 

 invalidate tlie classification to which they form the exceptions. 



The Canidee appeared in the Upper Eocene period, and the 

 genus Canis was well represented by species in the lowest Mio- 

 cene in Europe and the United States. The other genera are 

 represented by fewer species, and many of them are extinct. The 

 foxes ( Vulpes) are the most numerous of them, and but few extinct 

 species of them are known. America presents us with the greatest 

 variety of genera, as Enhydrocyon^ Temnocyon, and Paleeocyon 

 extinct, and Icticyon, extinct and recent. Speothus, extinct in 

 America, still exists in Asia. 



The most complete catalogue of the species Ganidae is that of 

 Dr. GraJ^ In his work the author brings together observations 

 of various naturalists, and adds a number of his own. He admits 

 a large number of generic divisions, but many of these, like those 

 of his Felidse^ are simply founded on specific characters. A few 

 good genera, however, exist, and a synopsis of their characters is 

 given below. The genus Megalotis is here excluded from the 

 Canidse on account of the unspecialized character of the superior 

 sectorial tooth, as is done by Dr. Gray : —

It is discoverable that the series represented b}' the al)ove genera 

 is a part of the greater line of the digitigrade C'arnifora, embrac- 

 ing the greater part of it which is less specialized than, or infe- 

 rior to, the })art covered b\' the Hysenidae and Felidse. "Without 

 entering into the relations of the Canidse with the civets and 

 Mustelidae, it may be remarked that the genera display a succes- 

 sive reduction in the number of premolars and molars from the 

 more ancient to modern geologic times. It is interesting to note 

 that the genera presenting the greatest reduction in all respects, 

 Synagodus and Dyiiodns, are now only known in a domesiicated 

 condition. Another reduction is seen in the number of tubercles 

 of the inferior sectorial.

In tliis genus the heel of the inferior sectorial tooth rises into 

 a single more or less median crest; in Canis the corresponding 

 front is basin-shaped, with tubercles on each side. The superior 

 molars of tlie typical species, T. aUigenis^ are unknown, but those 

 of a new species, described below, do not differ from those of the 

 genus Canis. The Cynodictis crassiroslris of Filhol, from the 

 French Phosphorites, approaches this genus. 



Temnocyon coryphaeus, sp. nov. 



This is the most abundant dog of the Truckee beds of the 

 John Day country. I have identified it heretofore as m}' Canis 

 hartshornianus, hnt I find on examination of the inferior sectorial 

 tooth that it is a species of Temnocyon. This genus was charac- 

 terized by me on evidence furnished by a mandible of a species 

 which I named T. alligenis,^ which is of considerably larger size 

 than the present one, but which agrees with it in the pre.sence of a 

 cutting edge instead of a basin on the heel of the inferior secto- 

 rial. The C. hartshornianus, known as yet from" few fragments, 

 is intermediate in dimensions between these two. 



Several crania, and more or less of the skeleton of the T. cory- 

 phaeus., are present in my collection. A nearly- perfect skull dis- 

 play's the following characters: The orbits are entirely anterior 

 to the vertical line dividing the skull into halves, and the muz- 

 zle is proportionately shortened. It is also narrowed anteriorly, 

 and its median line above is shallowly grooved. The interor- 

 bital region is greatly convex to the supra-orbital region, and is 

 grooved medially. The postorbital processes are mere angles, 

 and are flattened from below. The cranium is much constricted 

 behind the orbits, where its diameter is not greater than the width 

 of the premaxillary incisive border. The sagittal crest is much 

 elevated, and forms a i)erfectly straight and gradually rising out- 

 line to its junction with the incisor. The borders of the latter 

 are very prominent, extending backwards considerably beyond

tlie l)rain case. The zygoma is ratlier slender, is elongate, and 

 but little expanded. The otic bull?e are very large ; the paroccipi- 

 tal processes are directed backwards, at an angle of 45^, and are 

 rather elongate and acute ; they cap the bullae posteriorly. The 

 lateral occipital crests bound a fossa of the occipital region near 

 the condyles. The occipital surface is directed horizontally l)ack- 

 wards above the foramen magnum. This part of it, and its supe- 

 rior portion, are divided bv a median keel. 



The basioccipital is keeled on the middle line below. The 

 sphenoid is not keeled, and is concave, its borders descending on 

 the inner side of the bulloB. The pterygoid fossa is rather narrow, 

 and the haraular process is short. The posterior border of the 

 palate does not extend anterior to the posterior edges of the last 

 tubercular molar, and its middle portion projects backwards in a 

 triangular process. The palatine fossa for the' inferior sectorial 

 is shallow. The superior surface of the postorbital region is 

 roughened. 



The foramen infraorhitale exterixis \s rather large, and issues 

 above the anterior border of the sectorial tooth. The f. incisiva 

 are short, not extending posterior to the middle of the canines. 

 The /. j)alatina are opposite the posterior border of the sectorial. 

 They, lachrymale is altogether within the orbital border. They. 

 opticum is rather large. This species is peculiar in having the 

 /. /. spheno-07'bitale, rotunduvi^ and alisj^henoidale anteriu>' united 

 into one large external orifice. The alisphenoid canal is larger in 

 Cani.s latrans, and its posterior foramen small. The /. ovale is 

 further removed from the /. alUphenoidale than in the coyote, and 

 is exterior to and a little behind the/, carolideum. 



The nasal bones extend to above the middles of the orbits, and 

 contract gradually to tlieir apex. Their comliined anterior border 

 is a regular concave, and the lateral angles at this point are pro- 

 duced outwards and forwards. The posterior apex of the pre- 

 maxillary bone is separated from the anterior apex of the frontal 

 by a short 8i)ace. The niaxillo-malar suture is deeply notched in 

 front below, and it extends upwards to above the infra-orbital 

 foramen. A very narrow surface of the lachrymal is exposed on 

 the external surface. The pterygoid bone is distinct, and is nearly 

 equally bounded by the si)henoid and palatine on tiie outer side. 

 The inferior suture of the orbito-sphenoid runs in a groove, wliieh 

 is deei)est anteriorly.

The crowns of all the incisor teeth are narrow or compressed, 

 and, though slightly worn, present no indication of notch. As 

 usual, the external ones are much the largest in antero-posterior 

 diameter. The canines have robust fangs and rapidly tapering 

 crowns, which are but little compressed. The first superior pre- 

 molar is one-rooted, and the crown is simple. The crown of the 

 second is without posterior heel and tubercle, while the third pos- 

 sesses both. The sectorial is relatively short, less so than in G. 

 latrans. The blades are low and obtuse as compared with recent 

 species, and the notch separating them is quite open. The ante- 

 rior external heel is small, and there is no anterior external tuber- 

 cle. The first tubercular molar is. large, and the crown is nar- 

 rower than that of C. latrans. It has an obtuse external cingulum, 

 two external conical cusps, a V-shaped median ridge, and a wide 

 internal cingulum." This crown differs from the corresponding one 

 of C. latrans in having conical instead of compressed external 

 cusps, and a simple Y-shaped crest within instead of two adjacent 

 cusps. The second tubercular is smaller than in G. latrans, and 

 its tubercles are less distinct. There are two outer tubercles, a 

 Y-shaped ridge, and an inner cingulum, all very obscure. The 

 enamel of all these teeth is smooth.

One of these exIiiViits the following characters: there is a Tvell- 

 developed marginal lobe of the posterior cutting edge of the third 

 and fourth premolars as well as a low posterior heel, and a rudi- 

 ment of an anterior one. The heel of the sectorial is shorter than 

 the remaining part of the tooth, and rises to a cutting edge a little 

 external to the middle line ; there is a small tubercle at its inte- 

 rior base. The anterior blade-cusp of the sectorial is much lower 

 than the median, which is conical ; the two diverge, diminishing 

 the shear-like character and action of the tooth. The internal 

 cusp is well developed. The first tubercular is of moderate size, 

 and is a longitudinal oval in outline. The crown supports two 

 low tubercles anterior to the middle, of which the external is the 

 larger. The last molar has a single compressed root, and the 

 crown is a longitudinal oval in outline. Its position is on the 

 ascending base of the coronoid ramus, so that the crown is slightlj' 

 oblique. The masseteric fossa is profound and well defined ; its 

 anterior termination is below the middle of the second tubercular 

 • tooth. The horizontal ramus is not robust, but is compressed, 

 and rather deep.

While the characters of this dog do not separate it widely from 

 the genus Canis, many of them are quite different from those 

 presented by the recent species of the genus with wiiich I am ac- 

 quainted. Thus the union of the foramina spheno-orbitale and 

 rotunda, the anterior position of the orbits, and the postorl»ital 

 constriction are not seen in the wolf, domestic dog, coyote, jackal. 

 or the North American and European foxes. The size of the 

 brain was evidentlv less tlian in tiiose species, and the sectorial 

 teeth quite inferior in the cfliciency of their bla<les. These cha- 

 racters may be considered in connection with the low geological 

 position of the beds in which the species occurs.

The names proposed by Smith, Gra}', and others, and which 

 must be regarded as synonyms of Canis, are Lujyus, Dieba, Si- 

 menia, C/i7'ysocyon,a.nd Li/calopex. Manj^of the species, referred 

 to by European paleontologists under the name of Cynodiclis, 

 Pomel,api)ear to me to be undistinguishable from Canis. Through 

 the great kindness of M. Filhol, I possess specimens of the jaw? 

 of several of these species. A mandible with nearl}' complete 

 dentition of the Cynodoyi velaunum of Aymard, agrees very 

 nearh' with the jaws of some of the smaller species from the Ame- 

 rican White River beds, which I have referred to Canis. Helocyon, 

 Aym. may be distinct, but may not belong to the Canidce. 



The dentition of manj^ of the recent species of Canis differs in 

 very slight characters. The following may be detected in an ex- 

 amination of the superior molars of tlie three larger species most 

 accessible in the United States.

It is worthy of note that the wide oval form of the second supe- 

 rior molar of the Canis familiaris, exists equally in the extreme 

 races or species, the grayhound and bulldog, as I observe by ex- 

 amination of several crania of each. This has also been shown by 

 De Blainville. It is also seen in the terrier, and in various other 

 races. But in some Saint Bernard crania in the Museum of the 

 Academy- of Natural Sciences, this tooth is more elongate ; and in 

 some of the specimens of Canis hipu.'< from Europe its form is 

 quite tlie same. So this character, as might have been anticipated, 

 is not of universal application. Another character is seen in the 

 crania of three specimens, which are supposed to belong to Canis 

 terrarius. The superior border of the foramen magnum is inter- 

 rupteti by a deep vertical excavation. This is not seen in the St.

Bernard, the bulldog, greyhound, and other races, nor in any of 

 the feral or extinct species of the genus examined. It appears to 

 be associated with an increased size of the brain, and to be an 

 adaptation to the vermis of the cerebellum. The expansion of 

 the brain is also indicated by the protuberance of the frontal re- 

 gion, and the wide separation of the temporal fossa by a smooth 

 space on each side of the sagittal suture. This space does not 

 exist in the greyhound, but a narrow one is found in the bulldocr. 

 These characters are important on various grounds, but are her^e 

 mentioned in reference to the species of Synagodus and Di/,odu. 

 ^here they reappear. The absence of the second inferior tuber- 

 cular molar is also not uncommon in the '^ black and tan" terrier. 

 I do not see the propriety of retaining the generic name Ni/cte- 

 reufes, Temm. for the Cani.^ procyoninus of Japan. The jiecu- 

 liarity it presents in the form of the first superior tubercular 

 molar, the only one' on which the genus reposes, I would re-ard 

 as specific onl^-. ^ 



Vulpes. 



I would, with Gill, refer to this genus the species mentioned 

 by Gray and others under the generic names Fsrudalopex, Fenn- 

 ecus, and Leucocyon. The form of the post frontal process cer- 

 tainly does not furnish generic characters. 

 Urocyon, Baird. 



The peculiar cranial ridges, in which this genus resemlWes one 

 of the extinct genera of Mustelidee, appears to me to be the cha- 

 racter which warrants its separation from Vulpes.

the Himalaya region. Several otlier recent species liave been 

 named, but tliey are said by some authors to be varieties only of 

 the S. pi'imaeous. 

 Synagodus, Cope, gen. nov. 



The characters of this genus have been poiijted out in the ana- 

 lytical key. They are evidently as important as those which 

 define the divisions which are regarded as genera by naturalists. 

 It is not nnlikely that the typical species has been heretofore esti- 

 mated as a variety of Canis familiaris, but it exhibits two tren- 

 chant generic dental characters not found in Gani.% and three 

 uniquelpecific characters in the teeth, besides two characters of 

 the cranium found in but one or two of the subspecies of Canis 

 familiaris. 



The generic characters alluded to are: (1) the absence of the 

 second Inferior tubercular molar, and (2) the absence of the in- 

 ternal tubercle of the inferior sectorial. The absence of the second 

 inferior tubercular is evidently not one of those abnormal cases 

 which occur in various species of Canis from time to time; for the 

 first tubercular molar is smaller than in any known species of 

 Canis, and has but one root, a character which some persons 

 might regard as being the third of the generic category. Tlie 

 pre°molarrare 4—4, and of the usual form; the first in both jaws is 



one-rooted. 



It is uncertain whether any species of this genus exists in the 

 wild state. Should such not be the case, we can only predicate 

 the former existence of such an one entirely different from the 

 Canis familiaris, and which has given origin to the existing one 

 below described. 

 Synagodus mansuetus, sp. nov. 



Two crania represent this species in the :\ruseura of the Academy 

 of Natural Sciences. They agree in all essential particulars. The 

 incisor and premolar teeth present no peculiarities (the latter are 

 without marginal lobes), and the superior sectorial is normal. The 

 first tubercular has less transverse extent than in the Ganidse 

 generally, and its median crest and inner cingulum are con- 

 founded, a character which I have not found in any of the other 

 species accessible. Thus the crown of this tooth consists of an 

 external pair of tubercles, a basin, and a stout inner marginal 

 prominence. The second tuberculars are abnormally small in one 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 187 



specimen, and in the other the}' are wanting. The III. and IV. in- 

 ferior premolars have marginal posterior lobes. The inferior sec- 

 torial, as alread}' stated, has no inner tubercle. Its heel is peculiar 

 in the great elevation, and submedian position of one of its bor- 

 ders, approaching Temnocyon in this respect. The other edge is, 

 however, distinct, thus forming an unsj-mmetrical basin. The first 

 inferior tubercular is small, one-rooted, and the crown issubround, 

 and with a single median tubercle. In the other usual species of 

 Canis, Vulpes, and of many other genera of the family, this tooth 

 is elongate, two-rooted, and supports at least two tubercles. 



The general form of the crania resembles those of some of the 

 terriers. The brain-case is full and convex, the orbits are lateral, 

 and the muzzle is moderately elongate and narrowed. The osseous 

 surfaces are generally smooth, and there is no indication of the 

 ridge bounding the temporal fossa above. There is a deep sinus 

 of the superior border of the foramen magnum, a character above 

 noted as occurring in a subspecies included under Canis famili- 

 aris. 



I have been unable to ascertain whether the species now de- 

 scribed is one of the forms which have been referred to Canis 

 favxiliaris under a subspecific name. One of the specimens was 

 presented to the Academy- many years ago by Dr. Paul Goddard, 

 under the name of lap-dog. The form of the head shows that it 

 is not one of the forms of Canis extrarius hispanicus (of Fitz- 

 inger's Work on Dogs), which are represented by the King Charles 

 Spaniel, and other lap-dogs. As I can find nothing concerning it 

 in the books I give it a provisional specific name. 



The origin of the characters of this genus is doubtless to be 

 traced to prehistoric time, if not to an early tertiary geologic age. 

 Perhaps some of the species' characters are of later origin ; such 

 as llie obliteration of the superior border ridges of the temporal 

 fossae, and the large sinus of the foramen magnum. These cha- 

 racters, seen in a lesser degree in a domesticated true Canis, as 

 above mentioned, are evidently an adaptation to an enlarged brain ; 

 the one to the increased cerebral hemispheres, the other to the 

 protuberant vermis of the cerebellum. "Whether these characters 

 are due to a prolonged domostieation, and abnormal nutrition 

 within human habitations, remains to be ascertained. I remark 

 here that two crania of dogs found mummied in Egypt by Mr. 




188 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [lS70. 



Gli'Ulon, and now in the Museum of the A cfidemy, present all the 

 normal details of structure of Cania familiaris. 



The reduction in the number of teeth has been carried further, 

 and is probably of more modern origin in the new genus to be 

 described below. 



Dysodus, gen. nov. 



The characters of this genus, already indicated in the analytical 

 table, are as follows: I. f| ; C. }; P. m. H; M. j; inferior sectorial 

 without internal tubercle. The incisive formula might with pro- 

 priety^ read ", since these teeth are shed at an early age ; and for 

 the same reason the tuberculars might be stated J, since the last 

 one of the upper jaw is equally evanescent. I, however, give the 

 genus the benefit of the possible future discovery of species in 

 which the teeth in question may not be so early caducous, an«l 

 rely on the restricted diagnosis. It is thus apparent that the 

 genus Dysodus is distinguished from Synagodus by the alisence 

 of two premolars from each jaw. While the genera agree in other 

 respects, their typical S[)ecies are very different. 



This genus probably diverged from that now represented by 

 Synagodus, at a comparatively late period. Although it exhibits 

 a degree of dental reduction greater than that form, I admit that 

 the possibilitj' of its having come off from Canis rather than from 

 Synagodus is worthy of consideration. This is suggested i>v the 

 fact that the remaining (first) tubercular molar of the inferior 

 series is, in B. pravus, more like that of the species of Cauis in 

 all respects, among others, in having two roots. 



In D. pravHs the superior third premolar is sometimes shed, 

 like the incisors, having the formula, I. §; C. |; Pm. i; M. \. I 

 have excluded this character from the generic diagnosis, as in the 

 case of the incisor and superior tubercular teeth, because they are at 

 the present time ii7is(able; that is, the parts in question are in pro- 

 cess of metamorphosis. When characters are thus variable, they 

 cannot be used as the liases of natural divisions, but when they 

 are stable, we are compelled to recognize them. The characters 

 which I have included in the diagnoses of Synagodus and Dysodus 

 I have thought to be of this character, and I am by no means sure 

 that the absence of the superior incisor teeth should not be placed 

 in the same category. But none of these characters, whether 

 stable or unstable, can be regarded as monstrosities, such as mul- 

 tiplied digits, fissured palate, etc. They are, on the contrary, in

 sented by tiie genera of C'a/i/«/a', and of all digitigra<le (Jarnii'ora. 

 This, as already stated, consists in the reduction in the nunii)er of 

 the teeth and their tuhercles, forniin<i; aseries which, conjinencing 

 with the generalized extinct i\\)ii Amphicunn^ approaches more 

 and more nearly to the FtUdse. In the inferior sectorial, the 

 genus Jhjsodus approaches nearest of all Cauidre to some of the 

 earliest genera of cats, as Ilojtlophouenft (although easily distin- 

 guishable), while in the reduction of its premolars it approaches 

 the modern forms of that family. In the early shedding of the 

 incisors it reaches a condition not found in any carnivora. but one 

 which marks the extreme of development of the ungulate mammals 

 in various lines; e. g., liiuninanlia^ Oinnirora, and Amhh/jioda. 



Dysodas pravuB, ?p- nor. 



This species, which is known as the Japanese sleeve dog, is re- 

 presented in the Museum of the Academy- of Natural Sciences by a 

 complete skeleton, with the crania of two other indivi<luals. These 

 all belong to adult animals of a single litter, which were born in 

 the United States. The parents of these dogs were procured in 

 Japan b}- Dr. W. S. W. Ruschen])erger, U. S. N., now President 

 of the Academy. Other specimens have been brought to the 

 United States l»y oflicers of the navy. Dr. J. E. Gray figures a 

 skull of the same dog in the Proceedings of the Zoological Societ}' 

 of London for 1S07. 



The crania in the Academy's collection are almost exactl}' alike, 

 and resemble the one figured by Dr. Gray so far as can be discov- 

 ered. Hut Dr. Gra3''s specimen was jjrobably young, as the inci- 

 sor teeth and a premolar in each jaw iiavc not yet been shed, and 

 there are some cranial fontanelles still remaining. 



The characters displayetl by the skulls are as follows: The muz- 

 zle is excessively al)breviated, and the forehead very convex. The 

 brain-ease is almost glol)ular, and the zygomata ])r(jportionably 

 prominent. The superior marginal ridge of the temporal fossa is 

 pnnninent, and those of oppobiie sides are well separated as far 

 as tiie posterior parietal region. Here they ap|ir.»ach each other 

 abruptly, forming a wide sagittal crest. The muscular insertions 

 and otiier osseous ridges of the supra, ex- and basi-occii)ital re- 

 gions are strongly marked. The poslorliital process is pronnnent 

 and decurved. The vertical sinus of the superior border of the 




190 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1879. 



foramen magnum is deeply excavated. Tlie external surface of 

 tlie brain case and of the zygomata is minutel}' rugose. 



There are no lobes of the posterior border of the anterior supe- 

 rior premolars, while they are present on the two inferior premolars. 

 The superior sectorial is normal, while the first superior tubercu- 

 lar is like tliat of Synagodiis niansuetus, without distinct median 

 crest or tubercle. The heel of the inferior sectorial is also like 

 that of the species just mentioned; one border is much more ele- 

 vated than the other, and forms a cutting edge. The inferior 

 tubercular is small, is longitudinally oval, and supports two low 

 tubercles. This is one of tlie most important points of difference 

 between this species and the S. man^^uetus. In none of the speci- 

 mens is there any trace of the second tubercular. 



The skeleton is that of a dog of the size of a rather small black- 

 and-tan terrier. 



Dr. Ruschenberger states that the incisor teeth of the dogs 

 were shed at an age of about six months. He also informs me 

 that they did not breed after coming to this country. Dr. Gray 

 states that these dogs are fed largely on vegetable food in Japan, 

 and have an artificial existence in various respects. Tiiey are, 

 according to Dr. Ruschenberger, uncommon and expensive in 

 Japan. 



I have been unable to discover that any name whether varietal 

 or specific has been given to this dog. 



Icticyon, Lund. 



One existing and one extinct species have been found in Brazil; 

 the latter in the caves.- I describe a species from Oregon which I 

 cannot separate from them generically. 



Icticyon crassivultus, sp. nov. 



This dog is so far represented by a skull, which, while it lacks 

 the parietal and occipital regions, is otherwise nearly complete, 

 having both mandibular rami. The dental formula is, I. 3 ; C. } ; 

 Pm. -^ ; M. I. The single superior tubercular molar is similar in 

 general to that of other Ganidce. The inferior sectorial has an 

 internal cusp, and posterior heel, the latter with a low cutting 

 edge on one side. Inferior tubercular well developed. 



The dental formula of this animal is that of Icticyon, Lund, of 

 which a species has been found in the cave deposit of Brazil, and 

 another still lives in that region. 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PIIILAPELPIIIA. 191 



Char, specif. The snout is short ami robust, and the profile from 

 the parietal region is straight and descending. The premaxillary 

 border projects but little beyond the line of the extremity of the 

 nasal bones. The muzzle is slightly contracted in front of the 

 orbit and above the fundus of the canine alveoli. The latter cause a 

 swelling on the side. The infraorbital region is somewhat cracked, 

 but appears to have been nearly flat medially; laterally it de- 

 scends steepl}' to the supraorbital border. The orbit is not large, 

 and the zygomatic fossa is short. The nasal bones are narrowed 

 posteriorly, a little contracted medially, and expanded anteriorly, 

 tljeir lateral portions being produced along the pre-maxillaries. 

 Their combined nasal border is concave, and is without the notches 

 of some forms. The foramen infraorbitale exterius is of medium 

 size, and issues above the interval between the sectorial tooth and 

 the one in advance of it. Tiie mandibular ramus is quite robust, 

 and its inferior border is gentl}' convex. The masseteric fossa is 

 bounded by elevated borders, especially inferiorlj-, and the angu- 

 lar hook is prominent and robust. The condyle is situated on the 

 horizontal line of the tubercular molar, or a little above the others, 

 and has a wide transverse extent, chiefly inwards. The coronoid 

 process is high and wide, and is turned backwards so as to verti- 

 callj' overhang the condyle. Its anterior border is wide below, and 

 becomes horizontal above. 



The teeth partake of the robust character of the skull, with the 

 exception of the incisors. Of these the crowns of the external 

 are long and narrow, and the median small in the premaxillaries, 

 while those of the lower jaw are all small. The canines in both 

 jaws are quite rol)ust, and those of the lower jaw are rather ab- 

 ruptly recurved. The first premolar is small, and has a simple 

 crown and single root. The crowns of the other premolars are wide 

 at the base, and form each a simple cone, with a short posterior 

 basal heel. The upper sectorial is relativel}' not long, but is robust, 

 and with thick blades. The internal heel is well developed, as in 

 Canis, while a cingulum represents an anterior lobe. The tuber- 

 cular molar is narrower in fore and aft diameter than in Temnonjon 

 cori/phfeiia or Canix lafrans, although it presents the same de- 

 tails. These are a wiile ol»tuse external cingulum; two external 

 tubercles; a median obtuse tul)ercle, and a wide internal cin- 

 gulum. The premolars of the lower jaw are similar to tliose of 

 the maxillary bone. The inferior sectorial is quite robust, and 




192

[1819. 



the internal cusp is well developed. The heel is shorter than the 

 blades of the crown, and is wide and without tubercles in its some- 

 what worn condition. Its external border rises to an edge. The 

 tubercular is wider than the corresponding tooth in the cotempo- 

 rar}^ species of Ganidae^ although not so wide as long. Its crown 

 rises in two low tubercles which stand transversely near the middle.

Yan der Hoeven has given^ descriptions and figures of the 

 skull and dentition of "the Icticyon venaticus of Lund, of Brazil. 

 From these it appears that the present species ditfers from the 

 latter in the greater development of the inner part of the tuber- 

 cular molar of the superior series; in /. venaticus this part is 

 much reduced. The tubercular molar of the lower jaw is also 

 much smaller in the living species, the angular and coronoid pro- 

 cesses less developed, and the cond3de less extended transversely. 

 The cranium of the I.crassivuUus is much more robust, but not 

 much longer than that of /. venaticus. 



Discovered by J. L. Wortman in the Truckee beds of the White 

 River, Tertiarj' of the John Da^* River region of Oregon.

General Observations. 



In both Canidse and Felidse the reduction of the dental series 

 is connected with a contraction of the facial part of the skull, 

 either posteriorly or anteriorly. Enhydrocyon is an example of 

 anterior abbreviation, and Icticyon of posterior contraction among 

 Canidse, while Sniilodun and Lynx exhibit the anterior reduction 

 in Felidae. I have already pointed out that this reduction is ac- 

 companied by a corresponding increase in the size of the sectorial 

 teeth. But the reduction in the number of teeth in geologic time 

 has not been confined to the Carnimra^hnt belongs to the Ungu- 

 lates and Primates as well. The small number of teeth is gene- 

 rally associated with high specialization among Mammalia gene- 

 rally. The genera Synagodus and Dysodus are the most special- 

 ized of the Canidse. 



I may here refer to the frequently observed reduced dentition 

 of man. Darwin first pointed out the significance of the absence 

 of the third molars from the standpoint of evolution, citing Ame- 

 rican cases; and I have observed the similar bearing of the ab- 

 sence of the external superior incisors.* These reductions are 

 very frequent in the United States, and probably elsewhere among 

 civilized nations, but statistics on this point are yet wanting. My 

 friend Dr. C. N. Pierce, an experienced and scientific dentist of 

 this city, informs me that he knows of twenty-eight families in 

 which the external superior incisors are absent; to these, four 

 families may be added, which have fallen under my own observa- 

 tion : that the absence of one or both pairs of the third molars 

 is still more common, is confirmed by Dr. Pierce's experience. 



It is evident that we have characters which, if stable, would 

 indicate two or three genera of Hominidse additional to Homo. 

 They are unstable at present; that is, the}- are not yet invariably 

 found in any race or species of man, or, in other words, are not so 

 associated with other physical characters as to form a correlated 

 index of them. But experience in paleontology and zoology renders 

 it almost certain that these dental characters will at some future 

 time assume this degree of importance by becoming stable. This 

 is already indicated by the fact of their being constant in families 

 at the present time. As to what races will be thus distinguished 



' Proceediugs American Philosophical Society, 1871, p. 234 



I 




194 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1879. 



gcncrieally, H is not eas}' to indicate, but all those with prognathous 

 crania may be safelj^ excluded. It is improbable that Mongolian 

 races will early particii)ate in such a modification, as they have a 

 tendency to prognathism, and a generally strong dental develop- 

 ment. 



Since the reduction in the number of teeth is intimatel}' connected 

 with orthognathism, it is easy to suppose that it is primaril}' due to 

 the diminished space allowed by the contracted maxillar}' arcade. 

 This contraction is doubtless due to a deficiency of building mate- 

 rial, consequent on a transfer of force to some other part of the 

 structure during tlie period of growth. This transfer ma}' be to 

 the superior parts of the cranium, which is extended to contain an 

 enlarged brain. As the loss of a tooth from each side has so far 

 been sufficient to accommodate the dentition to the space which 

 it is to occupy, it is not likely that the absence of both I. 2, and 

 M. III. will become established. The reduction in the inferior 

 series is less, and I do not know of any examples of the absence 

 of the external incisors of the lower jaw. The loss of the third 

 inferior molars is, on the other hand, very common. It then may 

 be reasonably maintained that tvvo genera of Homhiidas will be at 

 some future day added to Homo; that the latter will include the 

 inferior races of men, and the future the superior; that, although 

 in specific characters there raaj' be a want of greater constancy in 

 the species of the new genera as compared with each other than 

 as compared with the primitive and true Homo, they will pre- 

 sent cases of what is elsewhere known in zoolog}', that the 

 same or nearly the same specific characters may be found in dif- 

 ferent genera. Under such circumstances the form referred to a 

 new genus becomes at the same time distinct species. The genera 

 of Hominidse will then, if the characters become constant, be as 

 follows: — 



Homo. 

 Metanthropos. 

 Epanthropos.

Explosion of a Diamond. — Prof. Lkipy exhibited a l)lack a2;ate

 to him by Mr. Ernst Kretzmar, jeweller, who informed him that 

 the person who wore it recently was leaning with his head upon 

 his hand, on a window ledge in the sun, when the diamond ex- 

 ploded audibly, and with suflicient force to drive a fragment into 

 his hand, and another into his forehead. On examining the dia- 

 mond, the fractured surface, following a cleavage plane, exhibits 

 apparently the remains of a thin cavity, such as is sometimes seen 

 in quartz crystals. The fracture also exposes a conspicuous par- 

 ticle of coal. Prof. Leidy thought that the ex|jlosion ha<l been 

 due to the sudden expansion of a volatile liipiid contained in the 

 cavity, as frequently occurs in cavities in man}' minerals.

hibit a profusion of cocoons. In seeking for specimens of the 

 male moth, he had collected only three, in a walk along one side 

 of the square, from the railing, where hundreds of the wingless 

 females were to be obtained, as the}^ rested with their foamy white 

 raasses of eggs on their cocoons. From the fewness of the males 

 lie was led to suspect that the females might, perhaps, in many 

 instances, deposit the eggs in an unfecundated condition. To 

 ascertain if this were so, he collected several dozen cocoons with 

 pupse of females, distinguished b}^ their comparatively robust 

 character, and placed them in a covered box in his study in the 

 third story of a back building, separated from the nearest place 

 where there were other cocoons by the front building and the 

 width of the street in front of his house. As the females came 

 out of the cocoons, distended with eggs, these, with the exception 

 of a few which appeared to be accidentally' dropped in several in- 

 dividuals, were retained. After some daj's, as none of the females 

 laid their eggs, the box was uncovered, and on the second morning 

 subsequent)}', several individuals had deposited masses of eggs, 

 though no males were present in the box. However, on examin- 

 ing the vicinity, four male moths were detected on the outside of 

 the curtain of the window in which the box had been placed, from 

 which it was supposed that the females had been visited by males 

 attracted during the night from the neighborhood. 



The case related reminded him that some years ago a collector 

 of butterflies in the suburbs, informed him that he frequently' ob- 

 tained male specimens of the Cecropia and Luna moths by pinning 

 females to the side of the window, when, in the morning after, he 

 would almost certainly find males in conjunction with them. The 

 means b}^ which the males thus find their mates at night and in 

 out-of-the-wa^'^ places were not obvious, as the insects appear to 

 be incapable of producing sounds or scents that are appreciable 

 to our senses.

 living specimens of the hone^' ant, Myy-mecoci/slu.i Jlt'.ricanus, 

 AVesniael. These embraced three worker castes, major, minor, and 

 dwarf, the hone^'-ltearer, and tlie fertile queen. The artificial nests 

 liad been brought from the Garden of the Gods, Colorado, where 

 the honej'-ant had been discovered by Mr. McCook. They had 

 previously been supposed to be confined to a more southern lati- 

 tude. The nests are found on the tops or southern slopes of 

 ridges. In exterior architecture they fire small gravel-covered 

 nioundlets, truncated cones, pierced in the centre by a gate, or 

 jterpendicular opening from three to six inches deep. The interior 

 architecture was illustrated by numerous specimens l)rought from 

 excavated nests. It consists of a series of underground galleries 

 and chambers, cut through tlie gravel and sandstone to the dis- 

 tance of nearly eight feet in length, two to four feet beneath the 

 surface, and about ten to twelve inches in width at the widest part. 

 The honey-bearers were found hanging in groups to the rocjfs of 




198 PROCEEDINGS OF TFIE ACADEMY OP [1879. 



the lioncy chambers by their feet; their large globuhir abdomens 

 looking like bunches of small Delaware grapes. About eight to 

 ten chambers, containing each an average of about thirty hone}'- 

 bearers, were found. The workers cared for the honey-bearers 

 when the chambers were opened, and dragged tiicm into the un- 

 opened i)arts. 



The ants pi'oved to be nocturnal in their habits, remaining 

 within doors until after sunset, about 7.30 P. M., each evening, 

 when the workers issued forth in column, and dispersed among 

 the clumps of scrub oak, Quercus undulata. Here they sought 

 the galls made by a species of C^?nps, which grows abundantl}' on 

 the buslies, and licked therefrom a sweet exudation which issued 

 in small transparent beads from the surface. From 11.30 P.M. 

 to about 3.30 A. M., when the first streakings of dawn began to 

 appear, the workers returned home laden with the lioney. This 

 appears to be fed to the sedentary honey-bearers by disgorging it 

 in the usual way, and remains within the globular abdomens as a 

 store for future use. The economy of this habit appears to re- 

 semble that of the bee; the exception being that the bee's honey 

 is stored within the inorganic substance of a waxen cell, while the 

 ant's is lodged within the organic tissue of the living insect. 



The above is a brief abstract of observations presented in detail, 

 together with others not here referred to, which will appear in full 

 in subsequent reports of the Academy's Proceedings. 



Notices of some Animals on the Coast of New Jersey. — Prof. 

 Leidy exhibited a valve of the beach-clara, Mactra solidissima, 

 which he picked up among the numerous dead and bleaching shells 

 of Brigantine Beach, N. J. It attracted his attention Irom its 

 apparently having a fungus growing upon it. The fungus-like 

 excrescence presented a remarkable resemblance to a Folyporiis 

 growing from the stem of a tree. It is an outgrowth from the lip 

 of the shell, evidently dependent on an abnormal condition of the 

 mantle of the living animal. 



Prof. Leidy also stated that he had picked up on the beach at 

 Atlantic City, N. J., another valve of the beach-clam, which had 

 been recently cast on shore. The inner surface of the shell was 

 covered with a multitude of the beautiful ciliated infusorian, Freia 

 ampulla. The little creatures were still alive, and their curved, 

 flask-like cases were of a deep green color. 



Prof. Leidy further remarked that while at Atlantic City, Mr. 

 Philips had directed his attention to two interesting animals, re- 

 cently collected. One of these he recognized as tlie Bicidium 

 parasiticum, a parasitic anemone or Actinia, found on the large 

 jell}- fish, Cyanea arctica, so frequently thrown on shore. Tlie 

 other was a parasite of the shrimp, Palsemonetes vuijaris, which 

 be recognized as the curious Isopod, Bopyrus. Many of the 

 shrimps were infested with the parasite, the presence of which

DESCRIPTION OF A NEW BRANCHIPOD. 



BY JOHN A. RYDER. 



Upon examining a pair of Brancliipods which were kindly 

 handed me bj' Mr. D. S. Holman, and which had been collected 

 near Woodbury, N. J., I find them to be a form hitherto unde- 

 scribcd. I accordingl}' propose a name for the species. 



Streptocephalus sealii, nov. sp. 



In form and si/o this species resembles S. torvicornis, Waga, 

 but the third joint of the second antenna differs from that species 

 in the details of its structure, and the ovigerous sacs of the fe- 

 males are not blue as in Waga's animal. The inner branch of the 

 terminal joint of the male claspers is the shortest jnstead of the 

 longest, as in S. torvicornis ; at the interior anterior margin of the 

 short branch, there are two unequal lobes, extending forwards 

 and lying flat against the laminar posterior border of the anterior 

 branch ; at tlie lower posterior angle of this lamina, or blade of the 

 forward branch, there is a well-marked, somewhat falcate process, 

 which fits between the lower lobular process of the posterior 

 branch and its scythe-shaped lower extremitj'. The anterior 

 branch tlien crosses the posterior at nearly right angles, and for 

 about a third of its length maintains a pretty uniform thickness, 

 and is straight, when it suddenly swells 

 and bends forwards, and as suddenly- con- 

 tracts, and tapers for its remaining two- 

 thirds, ending in a slender, slightly-curved, 

 pointed extremity. The first joint is long 

 and robust, and from its apex external!}', 

 the cylindrical, curved, antenniform organ 

 arises, which is about as long as the fili- 

 form first antennfe. The second joint is 

 ver^' tortuous, and is strongly bent and 

 twisted upon itself. The third joint, which 

 bears the complex terminal appendages, is 

 wide; the appendages close against each 

 other like the blades of a scissors, whilst 

 the processes of their o[)posing margins interlock as has been 

 already' described, and as can be full}- understood by reference to 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 201 



the accompanying^ cut of the head of the male. Tlie front of ilie 

 head is prolonged into a straight beak, which hangs down nearly 

 vertically between the first joints of the claspers, and is tlattened 

 anlero-posteriorly, and emarginate at its tip. The antenniform 

 appendage is much longer than in S. teramis, Packard, whilst the 

 terminal branches of the claspers are widely different from tlio.se 

 of that species in their shape and relative proportions. The male 

 organs are very feebly armed with a few short spines, and are 

 nearl\- straight. 



The cephalic horns of the female are twisted upon themselves, 

 slightly bent and flattened at their extremities, which are fringed 

 with short hairs. The large lateral, ovoid, pedunculate, apparently 

 glandular organs behind tiie eyes, are the same in size and shape 

 in both sexes. The ovigerous sacs are large, nearly half as long 

 as the abdomen, conical in form, and contain a great number of 

 ochraceous eggs, more numerous and much smaller than those of 

 Chirocephalus hoi manii from the same localit}-. The male is of a 

 beautiful green, deeper about the head, as though saturated with 

 acetate of copper; the female, on the other hand, is yellow with a 

 tinge of green, verging to brownish in parts, and is very nearly 

 of the same size as the male, if not a little larger. This simihiritv 

 in the size of the sexes, with a tendency in the females to be 

 largest, is observed only in S. lorvicornis, as far as I am aware. 

 The two rather long, plumose, tapering branches of the tail are 

 red in both sexes, but of a much l)rigliter red in the female ; more 

 slender in the male. Length 27 mm. 



I name the species for Mr. W. P. Seal, who collected the first 

 typical specimens; the same gentleman has since furnished me 

 with an additional supply of examples. 



The known species of this genus are accordingly as follows :_ 

 Strcptocephahts lorvicornix, Waga, % 1 inch, 9 about 14 liii., 

 Warsaw, Poland. 



S. cafer, Loven, 15 mm. long. Cape of Good Hope. 



S. aimilU, Baird, % H lin., 9 «; lin. long, St. Domingo. 



S. texanus, Packard, % .r,'^ in.. 9 .55 in. long, Texas. 



S. icatsonii, Packard, t, Ifi mm., 9 12-18 mm., P:ilis, Kansas. 



S. sealii. Kyder, 27 mm. long. New Jersi-v. 



All of the species are found in fresh water. 



The distribution of the species of the foregoinc: ceniis. and the 

 resemblance existing in some features between the Polish and New 

 14 




202 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879- 



Jersc}^ si)ecies is \cvy remarkjvble. Why such a resemblance 

 slioulil exist between two fresli-water crustaceans separated from 

 each other liy a salt ocean 3000 miles wide, and nearly a thtnisand 

 miles of land besides, is a proljlem yet to be solved by cliorologists 

 and biologists. Indeed, the distribution of both branchipods and 

 ))hylloi)ods in general, is not a little singular, and all those who 

 have the opportunity of acquiring any data in regard to the sub- 

 ject sliould be careful to put them on record.

On CriataleUa Mae. — Prof. Leidy remarked that a few days ao^o, 

 while ramltlinir in the Park with his little daughter, she had called 

 his attention to what she supposed to Ije numerous caterpillars at 

 the bottom of a brook. On examination they proved to be an ex- 

 traordinary accumulation of Crii^tatella Idac This species of poly- 

 zoon, or fresh-water ciliated i)oly|), he had discovered at Newport, 

 R. I., upwards of twenty years a^o, and described in tiie Pro- 

 ceedings of this Academy (1858-59). lie had repeatedly sought 

 for it in the vicinity of Philadeli^hia, but had never found it until 

 now. 



The development of the Cristatella in the locality indicated is 

 most remarkable and wonderful for its extent. Thousands of 

 vermicular groups spread over the bottom of the brook for about 

 twenty feet of length and a jard diminishing to a foot in breadth. 

 They invest all the submei'ged stones and plants, and are so closely 

 crowded as to intertwine with one another, leaving only narrow 

 intervals, without room for movement except by mutual displace- 

 ment. The groups are all attached to a common l)asal membrane, 

 from which, however, they are capable of separating tliemselves. 

 A lai'ge patch of the meml)rane covered with grou|»s of the Cris- 

 tatella was raised and placed in a dish of water, and after a couple 

 of days most of the groups glided away from the membrani' to 

 the bottf)m and sides of the dish. The basal membrane is aml)er 

 colored, homogeneous, and obscurely granular. A patch of it, 

 four inches long by two and a half inches wide, closely covered 

 with groups of the polyji, preserved in alcohol, was presented as 

 a specimen for the must-um. 



It would appear that in the develoi)ment and growth of the 

 Cristatella groups, they from time to time break u|) into smaller 

 grou|)s, and retain their connection only through tlie basal mem- 

 brane, which seems to be of an excrementitious ciiaracter 



TliL- basal membrane of the Cristatella was further interesting 

 from the circumstance that in the intervals of the groups of polyps 

 it harbored multitudes of l)ijjiu(jia corona. 




204 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



At tills season the Cristatella groups are full of statoblasts or 

 winter eggs, in all stages of development. The mature stato- 

 blasts, including the annulus, but excluding the marginal anchor 

 spines, measure from 1.15 mm. to 1.225 mm. in breadth. Of fifteen 

 specimens, seven measured 1.2 mm. in breadth. The numl)er of 

 anchor spines usually ranges from 60 to 70; but in a few speci- 

 mens as low as 53 and as high as 74 were counted. Both in size 

 and the number of spines thej' considerably exceed those of Cris- 

 taU'Jla mucedo and C. ophidoidea. 



The individual polyps of CrUlateUa Idae when fully extended 

 are about 3 mm. in length, and their arms support about 80 

 tentacles. The stomach is chocolate brown; sometimes lighter 

 5'ellovvish or greenish-brown. 



The same locality' was further remarkable for its profusion of 

 other animals, especially for the abundance of flesh-colored Hydras, 

 and the groups of Vorticellas. Tufts of Anacharis were white 

 from the latter. 



Lieut. C. A. H. McAuley, U.S. A., was elected a correspondent.

On Amceba Blaltse. — Prof. Leidy remarked that while perusing 

 the communication of Prof. Biitschli on "'Flagellata and other 

 related Organisms" (Beitriige zur Kenntniss der Flagellaten und 

 einiger verwandten Organismon), in the Zeitschrift fiir wissen- 

 schaftliche Zoologie, 1.S78, 205, his attention was especiall}' at- 

 tracted by the description of a parasitic amoeboid living in the in- 

 testine of the cockroach, Blatta orientalis. It recalled to mind 

 that he had observed the same creature a number of years ago, 

 in as9<^)ciation with the ciliated infusorian he had described as 

 NyctoiherxiK ovali.^. At that time he had viewed it as a young 

 form of a Gregarina, and had intended giving it and other para- 

 sites of the cockroach more critical examination, but failed to do 

 so. The parasitic ama'boid, which Prof. Biitschli describes under 

 the name of Amceba Blattse is particularly interesting on account 

 of its habit and its somewhat peculiar character. Prof. L. had 

 recently examined some cockroaches, and found abundance of the 

 amoeboid in association witli Nijclotherus ovalis, Lopliomonas blat- 

 tarum, Oxyurus gracilis, and 0. appendiculatus, and an algoid 

 plant. 



The amoeboid he thought was worthy of a generic distinction 

 from the true Amceba holding a position between this and Prota- 

 moeba. From the former it differed in the al^sence of a contractile 

 vesicle and commonly also of vacuoles, and in the want of differ- 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PIIILADELPHIA. 205 



entiation of einlosarc and ectosarc ; and from the latter in the 

 possession of a well-defined nuclens. He projjosed for it the fol- 

 lowing name with distinctive characters: — 



Endamceba. 



General character and habit of Amoeba ; composed of colorless, 

 homogeneons, granular protoplasm, in the ordinary normal active 

 condition without distinction of ectosarc and endosarc ; with a 

 distinct nucleated nucleus, but ordinarily with neither contractile 

 vesicle nor vacuoles.

 advance. Protoplasm finely granular, and wiien in motion more 

 or less distinctly striate. Nucleus spherical, granular, with a large 

 nucleolus, r)istinct food i)articles commonly few or none. Size 

 of globular forms 0.054 mm. to 0.075 mm. in diameter; elongated 

 forms 0.075 mm. by O.Ofi mm. to 0.15 mm. by O.U9 mm. Parasitic 

 in the large intestine of Blatta orientalis. 



The Eiidama'ba blatlae affords a good example of a primitive, 

 active nucleated organic corpuscle, or a so-called organic cell with- 

 out a cell wall. In the encysted condition it would be a complete 

 nucleated organic cell. Endamrrba may be recommended as a 

 convenient illustration of a primitive form of the organic cell on 

 account of its comparatively ready access.

On the Supposed Sensitive Character of the Glands of the As- 

 clepiadaceae. — Mr. E. Potts, referring to a communication made 

 a year ago to the Academy and published in its Proceedings for 

 1878, p. 283, with regard to the supposed discovery of a sensi- 

 tive contractile power analogous to tliat of Dionea, in the stig- 

 matic glands of the Aselepiadacejv, said that during the past 

 summer he had given many luMirs to a careful examinalion of the 

 subject, resulting in an entire failure to confirm his former pt)si- 

 tion. This examination had eml)raced at least five species of the 

 typical genus — Asdepias, and single species of each of the allied 

 genera, — Araujia, Phytsianihus, JJoi/a, Gonolobus^ aud Stapelia. 




206 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



Tlie phenomena wiiich, last 3'ear, were regardefl as showing 

 great probability, if not eonvincing proof, of the contractile power 

 referred to, were: — the grasping of a slender hair by said glands 

 with sufficient force to allow of the withdrawal of the i)ollen- 

 masses ; and a coincident change in the appearance of the jaws 

 or lips of tiie same glands. Tiie facts are undoubtedly as stated; 

 but the circumstances attending the change had been imperfectly 

 noted or their significance misinterpreted. The lips of tlie glands 

 in their primar}', undisturbed ])osition, which had been thought 

 to be separated by a sensil)le distance, allowing of the insertion 

 of the foot or prol)oscis of an insect were now seen to be thick- 

 ened and chamferred off along the upper edge, leaving a wedge- 

 shaped groove, but still touching one another at the lower surface. 

 No accidental or intended intrusion would therefore be successful 

 in reaching the inner surface of the cylindrical gland; and bj- very 

 many experiments it was amply proven that no amount of touch- 

 ing or pressure upon the edges of this groove was followed by any 

 change of position. 



He then explained how the removal of these glands and their 

 associated poUinia H'a.s effected by insect agency, calling attention 

 to the narrow passage left between the rigid proximate edges of 

 the adjacent anthers; showing that it was widest at their lower 

 extremity, and quickly narrowing, led up into, and was continu- 

 ous or coincident with the before-named groove through the gland ; 

 so that the foot of fly or bee inserted below while the insect was 

 crawling over the flower, was almost necessaril}' drawn along it 

 until it readied and entered the gland. The very delicate attach- 

 ment of the latter to the stigma was then easily ruptured, and the 

 insect escaped, carr3'ing glands and i)ollinia with it. Experiment 

 showed that it was only when the glands were so far removed from 

 their proper position that the caudicles or arms connecting them 

 with the pollen masses were relieved from the restraint in which 

 they had been held on the curved surface of the stigma — that their 

 lips completely closed upon the intended substance, giving them 

 the changed appearance formerly misunderstood. 



A comparatively high magnifying power and delicate manipu- 

 lation of the light further showed, just below the meeting edges 

 of the anthers, a series of fine sjiicula-like hairs inclined upwards, 

 having a tendency to guide into and restrain within the passage 

 any ot>ject which had once entered at the widened end. In some 

 species, noticeably in Araujia albens, the nectarial reservoir was 

 shown to be placed immediately below this opened passage, and 

 when the moths which frequent them thrust their proboscis down 

 into the tubular corolla in search of their honeyed food, they are 

 almost certain to be caught, not b}^ the glands primarily, but by 

 these trap-like edges of the anthers. Here, according to many ob- 

 servers, they are lield till they die; or, if successful in tearing them- 

 selves away, leave the entangled organ behind them in their flight. 




I8t9.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PIIILArELPIIIA . 207 



In tliis particular species. alr)ne, of tbose examined, the release of 

 the insect was not ellected when it had successfully drawn foot or 

 tongue along the whole lenoth of this anther trap, as the gland 

 which then receives it is firmly attached to the stigma by a broad 

 ligament at its upper end ; and all. exi-ejjting possibly the most 

 powerful insects, are still held, while IVom other species of the 

 family they fly otf hearing the pollen masses with them. These 

 in turn are caught in similar channels of other flowers, and lodged 

 against the under surface of the stigma, when their i)ollen tubes 

 are protruded and fertilization eflccted. 



This, if not necessarily cross fertilization is, at least, fertiliza- 

 tion by })olleu from the same or other flowers placed by an extra- 

 neous force against the stigmatic surfaces; and that the singular 

 arrangement of parts just mentioned, apparently so wonderfully 

 calculated to facilitate it, is made use of, is very evident. In the 

 course of bis observations upon a cultivated plant of Asclepias 

 curassavicum during the season of insect visitation, it was rare 

 to And a mature flower which had not lost some of its glands and 

 pollen masses, and very frequently all were missing. In many of 

 these, the pollinia from other flowers were to be found in the situ- 

 ation belbre stated ; and it was a very noticeable fact that from 

 50 to 80 per cent, of the flowers in these groups were fertilized^ 

 while those from which insects were excluded failed to produce a 

 single fertile follicle. A bee captured upon this plant carried upon 

 its legs and tongue thirty of the glands, representing sixty pollen 

 masses. B}' far tiie larger number of the latter had been torn 

 away from the glands since their removal, and possibly were the 

 agents in making fertile nearly the same numlier of flowers. 



A very singular fact on the opposite side of the account was 

 mentioned Ity Mr. Median in the Uotanical Section: that Arau- 

 jia albens rarely fruited when exposed to insects in the open air, 

 but in green-houses produced pods freely. 



On Amber containing Fossil Insecls Mr. E. Goldsmith called 



attention to a specimen of amber collected by Mr. Wm. L. Mactier 

 at Nantucket Island, Mass., in which were several well-preserved 

 fossil ants, a fly, and piobably small species of coleopteia The 

 specimen also contains a dicotyledonous leaf, of a cinnamon brown 

 color, with the edges free, and the imi)ression of another. This 

 was the first specimen of American amber examined by him in 

 which a trace of imbedded insects could be observed, although this 

 may have been owing to the fact that the others were cretaceous, 

 and therefore, on account of their age, opa(pie. 



The and)er from Nantucket Island is probably tertiary, and is 

 of a fine pale claret color without being at all variegated. The 

 specimen examined was an irregular mass of about eleven centi- 

 metres in leniith, somewhat pointed at one end and thicker and 

 rounder at the other, with longiludinal furrows. It is a little 

 heavier than water. The lustre is resinous, but if freshly fractured 




208 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



it is glassy. The form of the fracture is conchoidal and perfectly 

 smooth. Hardness between two and three. The specimen re- 

 seml)los in its external aspect fossil copal so much that it may be 

 easily mistaken for that material. The fresh vitreous lustre of the 

 amber, however, remains after repeated rubbing and exposure, 

 while copal becomes dull under sueii treatment. The amber may 

 be worked with a file or an edge tool into even surfaces; under 

 like treatment copal cruml)les, and gives an uneven glistening 

 plane. When the finger is rubbed to and fro on the amber it will 

 not powder or become mealy like copal. When a portion of the 

 specimen was gently heated in a glass tube closed on one end a 

 dense gas was obtained having the odor of burning fat. After 

 cooling minute radiating groups of crystals were noticed ; fossil 

 copal gives no such indications. Tlie amber burns with a yellow 

 smoking flame, emitting an odor not so disagreeable as that given 

 off during distillation, and leaves some unconsumed carbon. The 

 powder is white, and, if brought in contact with oil of vitriol, it 

 will readily dissolve, fcn-ming a ruby red solution, which, when 

 poured into water, gives a nearly colorless precipitate partially in 

 a crystalline state. It is decomposed by nitric acid, forming at 

 first a soft yellow compound which afterwards dissolves. If the 

 excess of the nitric acid be evaporated and water added, thin plates 

 of a golden-yellow color form. These plates appear to be succinic 

 acid ; they easily dissolve in caustic ammonia, and the solution 

 affords, with a solution of sesquichloride of iron, the well-known 

 cinnamon-brown precipitate of succinate of iron. Both solutions 

 were perfectly neuti'al. From the solution of the succinate 

 ammonia the succinic acid can be separated on the addition of 

 nitric acid. This process for observing succinic acid in amber 

 is especiallj' applicable when but a small quantit}^ of the acid is 

 present, in which case the process b}' sublimation fails or becomes 

 uncertain. Chloroform is a good solvent for amber, but alcohol, 

 ether, and bisulphide of carbon dissolve it only sparingly. Copal 

 when kept in ether swells to a greater volume; amber does not 

 increase in bulk.

Ward^s Nafur-al Science E.^tahlishmenf. — Prof. Leidy stated 

 that the reputation of Prof. Heniy A. Ward's "Natural Science 

 Establishment," at Rochester, X. Y., was such, that lately he had 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PIIILABELPIIIA. 209 



been inducefl to make it a visit. Though he had seen collections 

 of casts of fossils and skeletons in the museums of colleges and 

 other institutions, IVom Prof. Ward's establishment, he liad not 

 been prepared to find it so extensively representing all depart- 

 ments of natural history as it proved to be, and even in Europe 

 he had seen no dealer's stock that was equal to it. For the variety 

 of its objects, and the excellence of preservation and preparation 

 of the specimens, he recommended it to the Acadeni}- and to others 

 as a source from whence to suppl}' the wants and deficiencies of 

 their cabinets. The collection of skeletons is large, and is admi- 

 rable for the cleanness, whiteness, and perfect mounting of the 

 specimens. A few thousand dollars expended in this department 

 would be of much importance to the museum of the Academy. 

 A collection of glass models of invertebrate animals, made by 

 Leopold Blaschka, of Dresden, had especiall}' attracted his atten- 

 tion. The models are remarkable for their accuracy- and beauty, 

 and they supply a means of illustration whicii has long been felt. 

 They represent soft and delicate forms which cannot be satisfac- 

 toril3' preserved, and others too minute to be examined with the 

 naked eye. Moreover their price is so moderate, that it is to be 

 hoped that the Academy may make earl}' provision to obtain a 

 series. Prof L. exhibited specimens, such as the Red Coral, 

 Corallium r«6rMm, of the natural size and magnified ; the h\'droid 

 polyp, Hydractinia ec/ii»a/a, which lives on the shell of the Hermit 

 Crab, etc. Prof. L. added that at the present time when society 

 was awakened to the importance of the study of natural history, 

 Prof. Ward was worthy of tlie highest commendation for the ability 

 and energy he had displayed in accumulating so ample a means 

 for its illustration.

ago, showing that the plant known in gardens as Thuja ericoides 

 was but a form of arbor vitiB that had carried its juvenescent con- 

 dition through life, instead of changing its character for the " adult" 

 condition aiter its first three months of existence, as arbor vitaes 

 general!}' do. Out of a large number of trees of this form that 

 had been growing on bis grounds for fifteen years, one had as- 

 sumed the normal adult condition. Since he had first recorded 

 his observations, most of the leading botanists had come to regard 

 these plants as he did, and there seemed no need of fuilher evi- 

 dence ; but this changed plant had now^ produced fruit for the first 

 time, specimens of which he exhibited. It was exacth' 'Thuja oc- 

 cidentalis. These juvenescent forms after fifteen years' growth had 

 shown only this single disposition to assume the final or a<lult con- 

 dition or to flower. He also exhibited a similar juvenescent form 

 known as Retinospora squarrosa, one plant of which out of some 

 hundreds had developed to Retinospora obtusa. In the case of the 

 arbor vitpe the change from the juvenescent to the adult form was 

 gradual ; in Retinospora it was by a single leap. Each condi- 

 tion had its separate color, and separate chemical principles, the 

 latter point having been called to Meehan's observation by Dr. 

 Sterry Hunt; but this was characteristic of all such morphologi- 

 cal changes. There was a difference in the rind of orange and in 

 its pulp, — in the flesh of the peach and in its kernel, though all 

 were morphologicall}' the same. It was, however, worth remem- 

 bering that with morphological, changes there was often change 

 in cell structure, as well as in sensible properties. Mr. Meehau 

 further called attention to the almost identical characters of the 

 two juvenescent forms exhibited — while in the adult they were so 

 widely divided — for tliere were in all Coniferje prol)al)ly no two 

 genera better marked in the characters derived from their fructifi- 

 cation than Retinospora and Thuja.

ON SOME NEW EOCENE FOSSILS FROM THE CLAIBORNE MARINE 

 FORMATION OF ALABAMA. 



BY AXGELO HEILPRIN. 



The following species of fossils (witli the exception of Ros'ellaria 

 Wliitfiehli) were picked out from an accumulated mass of Clai- 

 borne sand and shell, deposited in the American Museum of Natural 

 History', New York City, and being of more than ordinarj- inter- 

 est, as in part pertaining to genera hitherto not recognized as 

 belonging to the formation, I have deemed them worthy of descrip- 

 tion. 



TEIN03T0MA, II. .y A. Adams. 

 Teinostoma rotula, nob. PI. xiii., fig. 1. 



Shell orbicular, depressed ; polished; whorls three, bod v-whorl 

 with an impressed line immediately below the suture; umbilicus 

 small, surrounded by a broad callous area; aperture nearly cir- 

 cular ; inner lip expanded into a callus near the umbilical region. 



Diameter .2 inch. 



Claiborne, Alabama. 



This is the first species of Teinostoma described as such exist- 

 ing in the Eocene formations of the United States. Mr. Lea's 

 Rolella nana {Umbonium, Conrad), also from Claiborne, which I 

 have not had an opportunity to examine, may prove to be a 

 Teinostoma. 



DELPHINULA, Roissy. 

 Delphinula solaroides, nob. P. xiii., fig. 2. 



Shell turbinate, depressed, broadly umbilicate; whorls four, 

 channeled below the suture, and ornamented with obtuse ribs 

 radiating from about the centre of the upper surface; umbilicus 

 with a cfutral unrolling prominent crenulated line, and inter- 

 mt'diate finer lines; margin crenulated; peristome continuous, 

 trumpet shaped. Nacreous. 



Diameter 1 inch. 



Claibf)rne, Ala. 



This species could readily be mistaken for a Solarium, from 

 all species of which, however, it is distinguished by its pearly 




212 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1879. 



SOLAHITTM, Lamarck. 

 Solarium striato-granulatum, nob. PI. xiii., fig. 3. 



Shell conical, depressed ; whorls five, slightly convex, and 

 ornamented with four principal revolving lines of granules ; mar- 

 gin acute, crenulated, and carinated onl^' on the inferior surface ; 

 base with three prominent crenulated lines surrounding the um- 

 bilicus, and with about three or four almost simple lines. 



Diameter | inch. 



Claiborne, Ala. 



NATICA, (Adans.) Lam. 

 Natica bi-sulcata, nob. PI. xiii., fig. 4. 



Shell subglobose ; spire but slightly elevated ; whorls four, 



smooth, the bodj'-whorl with radiating sulci on the summit ; 



• mouth semi-lunate, about f the length of shell ; columella slightly 



thickened, the callus reflected above the middle; umbilicus broad, 



doubly grooved, the grooves transversely striated. 



Length .3 inch. 



Claiborne, Ala. 



This species differs mainly from the N. magno-umbilicata of 

 Lea in having the umbilicus doubly grooved. 



ODOSTOMIA, Fleming. 

 Odostomia laevigata, nob. PI. xiii., fig. 5. 



Onh' a fragment of this species has come to my observation, 

 but its characters are sufficiently defined to distinguish it from all 

 the other species of Odostomia existing in our tertiary formations. 

 It mainly differs from the Acteeon (Odostomia) melanellus of Lea 

 in the subangulate form of the body-whorl, and in the columellar 

 plait, which in our species is transverse, and not oblique. 



Length ? . 



Claiborne, Ala. 



TORNATELLA, Lamarck. 

 Tornatella bicincta, nob. PI. xiii., fig. 6. 



Shell ovate, spire elevated ; whorls about six, the bod\'-\vhorl 

 with numerous revolving lines closel}' beset with punctures, and 

 two broad smooth bands on the superior portion ; two or three of 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 213 



the remaining Avhorls also with two smooth bands ; mouth narrow, 

 about ^ tlie length of shell. 



Length .4 inch. 



Claiborne, Ala. 



This species differs from the Actseon ( TornateUa) lineatus of 

 Lea {A. idoneus? Conrad) in having two smooth bands on the 

 upper portion of the bod3-whorl instead of one. Mr. Lea men- 

 tions having in his cabinet a species from the Paris basin also 

 ■with two bands, but I fail to discover the same described in the 

 work of M. Desha3'es. 



PISANIA, Bivon. 

 Fisania bucciniformis, nob. PI. xiii., fig. 7. 



A fragment only of this, the 6rst described species of true 

 Fisania existing in the Eocene formations of the United States 

 has come to my notice. The body-whorl is about | inch in length, 

 striated on the inferior portion, and with a slightly impressed 

 line beneath the suture ; mouth about ^ length of body-whorl; canal 

 almost obsolete ; columella arcuate, wrinkled at base ; outer lip 

 striated within by about seven elevated ridges. 



Length ? . 



Claiborne, Ala. 



The Pisania Claiborneniiis of "Whitfield (Am. Journ. Conchol., 

 vol. i., p. 259) appears from the description and figure to be more 

 nearly related to Triton. 



CONTJS, L. 

 Conus pulcherrimas, nob. PI. xiii., fig. S. 



Sliell conical ; spire elevated ; whorls about seven, slightl}' con- 

 cave above, granularly crenulated on the angle, and transversely 

 striated; a prominent simple line below the angle, and one of 

 granulations beneath the suture. Aperture? 



Length about .\ inch. 



Claiborne, Ala. 



PLETIKOTOMA, Lam. 

 Plearotoma insignifica, nob. PI. xiii., fig. 9. 



Siiell fusiform, witli prominent revolving lines below the middle 

 of the whorl; spire elevated; whorls about five, angular; canal 

 short, obliquely curved ; mouth contracted. 



Length ] inch. 



Claiborne, Ala. 




214 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1879. 



The description and figure of Fusus nanua as given by Lea in 

 his "Contributions," agree in all essential respects with the above. 

 No mention is made of the sinuated lines of growth peculiar to 

 the Plourotoniae, which in our specimens are very distinct. 

 Although I have not had an opportunit}'^ to examine Mr. Lea's 

 specimens, it appears to me, nevertheless, highlj' probable that 

 his Fusus will prove to be a Pleurotoma. 



Pleurotoma denticula, P.aterot. PI. xiii., fig. 10. 



This species, which is one of the most widely diffused of all 

 fossil Pleurotoniffi, has to my knowledge not been hitherto de- 

 scribed as occurring in an_y American formation. The P. nodo- 

 caj-inata, Gabb (unfortunately very poorly figured), in the collec- 

 tions of the Academy belongs to this species. Specimens are to 

 be found also in the Claiborne accumulation of the American 

 Museum of Natural History, New York. 



MELANIA, Lam. 

 Melania Claibornensis, nob. PI. xiii., fig. 11. 



Shell elongated, turreted ; whorls eight, of which the first three 

 are smooth, and the rest furnished with longitudinal folds, those 

 on the bod3'-whorl terminating at about the middle ; folds cut by 

 numerous deeplj' impressed revolving lines, giving a somewhat 

 imbricated appearance ; mouth elongated, oval contracted above, 

 and expanding at the base ; columella broad, flattened. 



Length .3 inch. 



Claiborne, Ala. 



This species, to which I have provisionally a})plied the specific 

 name of Claiburiiei^sis] is doubl}^ interesting as being the only 

 essentiall}' fresh-water gasteropod found. in the Claiborne marine 

 formation and of being at the same time most intimatel}' related 

 to a species found in the Paris basin, Melania mixta, Desha3'es. 

 It agrees essentially with all the characters as given by Deshayes, 

 and on comparison with his specimens will in all probability 

 prove to be identical. 



RISSOINA, DOrbigny. 

 Bissoina plicato-varicosa, nob. PI. xiii., fig. 12. 



Shell sub-turreted ; whorls about seven, convex, ornamented 

 with numerous longitudinal folds (on the bod^'-whorl from 10 to 

 12), and disfigured by several prominent varices; revolving lines

numerous, less prominent on the middle of the whorls; aperture 

 ovate, produced into a short canal. 



Length \ inch. 



Claiborne, Ala. 



This species closely resembles, but is less slender, than the 

 Bissoa inchoata. Desh., of the Paris basin. 



MESOSTOMA, Deshayes. 

 Mesostoma rugosa, nob. PI. xiii., fig. 13. 



Shell conico-turbinate; whorls about seven, scalariform, the 

 first three smooth, the rest ornamented with oblique lono-itudinal 

 plications, which are crossed by five prominent and a number of 

 lesser revolving ridges, giving the whole a cancellate appearance; 

 the folds on the body-whorl cease abrui)tly below the middle; 

 aperture sub-circular, dilated, and produced into a short oblique 

 canal ; outer lip somewhat crenulated by the terminations of the 

 revolving ridges. 

 Length .4 inches. 

 Claiborne, Ala. 



Four species in all are catalogued as belonging to this genus, 

 all from the Eocene of France. The above species difl^ers from 

 the M. grata, Desh., of the Paris basin only in the number of its 

 revolving ridges. The Cerithioderma prima of Conrad, from the 

 American Eocene, is a Mesoatoma. 



^ote. — There is some difficulty in determining the priority in 

 the institution of the genera Mesos'.oma and Cerithioderma. Tate 

 (Appendix to Woodward's "Manual," 1808) quotes the genus 

 Mt'sosloma from the year 1S04, whereas that portion of Deshayes's 

 work, wherein the genus is described, bears the date of 1858. 

 This is the second year of the publication of the entire work, and 

 as the first volume (Lamellii)ranchiata) was not completely issued 

 until 18G0, it is highly probable that the genus was not character- 

 ized prior to that year. Conrad publislied his genus Cerilhind rma 

 in .Maivh, 1 8(;0 (J. A. N. S., vol. iv., 2d series), as founded upon a 

 single species C. jirima, but as his characterization is vague and 

 very meagre, it appears more natural to accept the genus of Des- 

 hayes, which has already been accepted by most conchologists.

 Rostellaria Whitfieldi, nob. PI. xiii., fig. 14. 



Shell fusiform ; spire tapering, consisting of about nine flattened 

 volutions; bodj-whorl sub-angulale beneatli ; columella flexuous, 

 with traces of an obtuse fold ; outer lip with a swollen prominence

Two specimens of this species, both unfortunately bereft of 

 their wings, are in possession of the American Museum of Natural 

 History of New York. Their characters are so decidedly at vari- 

 ance with those of any other American Eocene Rostellaria, that 

 we feel no hesitation in applying to them a specific name, although 

 the broken nature of our specimens necessitates an incomplete 

 description. Allied species occur in the London clay and in the 

 Paris basin.

A COMPARISON OF THE EOCENE MOLLTJSCA OE THE SOUTHEASTERN 

 UNITED STATES AND WESTERN EUROPE IN RELATION TO THE DE- 

 TERMINATION OF IDENTICAL FORMS. 



BY ANGELO HEILPRIN. 



The study of the fauna, whether extinct or living, of any coun- 

 try resolves itself into two distinct methods of investigation, tlie 

 general and the comparative. In the general method we look upon 

 an assemblage or community of animal forms as constituting an 

 integral part of the country- it characterizes, and we then consider 

 it only in relation to that country and to itself (tlie animal forms 

 inter se). In the second or comparative method we no longer re- 

 gard this community as constituting a whole or unit, but merely 

 as a part of a more extensive communitj^, and we now view it in 

 the relation of a part to a whole. This comparative S3'stem of 

 investigation, wliich, it will be manifest, involves a thorough gen- 

 eral acquaintance with all or most extraneous faunae as well as the 

 one under special consideration, is one of great difficulty, and one 

 that requires more than an ordinary amount of acumen in its pur- 

 suit, for in the broad facts of geographical distribution are con- 

 nected some of the profoundest biological and ph^'sical problems. 

 The study of comparative or geogra[)hical zoolog}' constitutes one 

 of the essential fiictors of biological science, for without a true 

 understanding of the general affinities of scattered groups of 

 animals, our conception of the organic universe would be one of 

 disjointed parts instead of a continuous whole. We know, in fact, 

 little of a whole unless we comprehend its relation to its component 

 parts, and per contra^ we know little of a part unless we under- 

 stand the relation it bears to the whole. 



The Gubject of geographical distribution in its bearings on 

 geolog}', whether considered in its broader sense as pertaining to 

 groups, or in the more limited sense as pertaining to the individuals 

 comp(;sing those groups, cannot be over-estimated. It is by tiie 

 recurrence over broad or scattered areas of certain related animal 

 tjpes, and sometimes even over the most remote areas of identi- 

 cal specific forms, that the palaiontologist is enabled to arrange 

 and classify his strata. One single well-determined fossil will, in 

 the absence of further data, frequently determine approximately, 

 15 




218 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1879. 



and sometimes exactl}', certain geological horizons, and althongh 

 we cannot in most instances, as Prof. Hnxle}' has forcibly pointed 

 out, positivel3', or even approximately, correlate, as far as age is 

 concerned, distantly' separated formations, we can to a ver}^ great 

 extent correlate the cosmical conditions under which the forma- 

 tions in question were deposited. Tlie correct determination, 

 therefore, of all organic remains is one of the greatest import- 

 ance. 



Unfortunately for the development of the science, the doctrine 

 that identical specific forms cannot, or ought not, occur over 

 widely separated areas has taken root in the minds of a few of the 

 most eminent scientific investigators, the baneful effects of whose 

 authority in relation to this special line of researcii, will be en- 

 countered by the student at almost every step in his investigations. 

 The science of geographical palaeontology, at least as far as the 

 invertebrata are concerned, ma}' be said to be in this country still 

 in a state of infancy, a circumstance partly due to the limited 

 number of workers in the field, and parti}' to the influences just 

 stated. 



I have endeavored in the following pages to summarize as nearly 

 as possible the results obtained from a series of comparisons be- 

 tween the Eocene molhisca of Western Europe and that of the 

 Southeastern United States, undertaken with the view of deter- 

 mining with a certain amount of precision the number of identi- 

 cal and very nearlj^ related species. My comparisons were in a 

 number of cases made between actual specimens, and those mainly 

 determined in the localities to which the}' l)elong ; where no si)eci- 

 mens could be obtained I was compelled to content myself with 

 the various analyses of the descriptions and figures afforded by the 

 works of the most competent authorities. The result shows a far 

 greater intimate relationship to exist between the two faunae than 

 one is led to suppose from an examination of the "Check List" 

 prepared by Mr. Conrad for the Smithsonian Institution for 1866, 

 where, in fact, only about five species are enumerated as common 

 to the Eocene deposits of both shores of the Atlantic, viz. : Ostrea 

 ( Gryphodrea) eversa, Deshayes ; Cardita planicosta^ Lam. ; ? Pho- 

 rus (Onuafus) extensus, Sow.; Hippocrenes columbaria, Defr. ; 

 and (?) Valuta {Volutililhei^) mutata, Desh. In addition to these 

 Conrad enumerated in 1833 i^" Fossil shells of the Tertiary Forma- 

 tions," p. 34) the following: Sohrium patulum, Lam.; S. canali- 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF rHILADELPIII A. 219 



culatiim, Lam.; Bulimus (Nif^o) terehellofus, Lam.; Sigarelus 

 canaliculatus, Sow.; Calyplrsea {Trochita) trochiformis, Jauw. ; 

 Pyrula tricarinata^ Lam.; Avicula trigona, Lam.; Cytherea ery- 

 cinoi'rfe^, Lam. ; C. suberycinoides^ Desh. ; Corbis lamellosa^ Lam.; 

 and Fistulana elongala, Desh., most of wlucli on examination 

 prove to be as well American as European forms. Li the Ap- 

 pendix to Morton's Synopsis ("Synopsis of the Organic Remains 

 of the Cretaceous Group," 1834) only six European species are 

 recognized as occurring in the American formation: Solarium 

 canaliculatuin, hum.; S. patulum, Lam.; Bulimus lerebfllutus, 

 Lam.; Cardita plavicoata^ Lam.; Corbis lamelloaa^ Lam.; and 

 Fistulana elougafa, Desh. In the list published by Conrad in 1S45 

 (Amer. Journ. Science, 2d ser. vol. i. p. 219), of the preceding 

 enumerations only two species are retained as being •': analogous'' 

 to transatlantic forms, Cylherea Jlorloni, Con {Cytherea ery- 

 cinoides, Ijam.; and C. suberycinoides, Desh.) and Aoicula limula^ 

 Con. (A. trigona, Lam.), but in addition we have five new ones 

 catalogued: Cardita Blandingi, Con. (C. acuticosta, Jjam.) ; C. 

 rotunda^ Lea. (C asperula, Desh.); Cardium NicoUeti, Con. {C. 

 semigranosum [ — granulatum'], ^ow.) ; Turritella Mortoni, Con. 

 (=?) ; and RosteVaria laqueata, Con. {R. fissu7'ella, Lain.). 

 Finally'', all species considered identical prior to 18G6 are rejected 

 as such with one exception {Cardita planicosta) in the Smithso- 

 nian List. The reasons for so doing, which, in the raajoritv of 

 cases, I believe, are not stated, appear to me incomi)rehensible. 



In the introduction to his •' Contributions to Geology," 18.3.3, p. 

 19, Mr. Lea states that he is "not perfectly' satisfied that a single 

 species is strictly analogous to those from the Eocene Period of 

 Europe ", but in a note (pp. 207, 208) makes the fol- 

 lowing comparisons: Pasithea umbilicata^ Lea, witli Bulimus fere- 

 bellatu^. Lam.; Venericardia rotunda, Lea, with F. squamosa, 

 Lam.; Pectu}icul us obliqua[uus) ,'Lca,vri\,h P. nan us, J)esh.; Ostrea 

 dinaricata, Lea, with 0. flabcllala, Lam.; and Sulen Blainvillii^ 

 Lea, with Solen ejfusus, Lam. 



The list herewith appended, and which it is my intention to 

 complete at a future date, will, I trust, increase our knowledge on 

 the interesting questions of relationship and geographical distri- 

 bution. 




220 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



Ostrea divaricata, Lea. " Contributions to Geology," p. 90, pi. 3, fig. 69. 

 0. selkeformis, Conrad, pars ? 

 This oyster is referred without doubt both by Nyst (" Coqiiil- 

 les et Poly piers Fossiles,'' 1843, p. 323) and Giebel (Bepertorium 

 to Goldfuss' ''Petrefacta (?ermant«," 1866, p. 41) to the O.flahel- 

 lula of Lamarck, which is a very variable, and one of the most 

 widel}' diffused forms of fo.ssil oyster. It is cited by D'Orbigny 

 (Prodr. de paleon.) as occurring at Claiborne, Ala., and by Des- 

 hayes (Ayximaux s. vert., bassin de Parna) also at Cutch in India 

 and Cairo in Egypt. 



Pecten Deshayesii, Lea. Contr. p. 87, pi. 3, fig. 66 

 (et P. Lyelli, ace. to Conrad ?). 

 This Pecten is referred with but little doubt by Nyst (Coqu. et 

 Pol., p. 288) to P. opercularis, Lamk., which species, however, be- 

 longs to a much more recent period than the Eocene of Alabama. 

 On the assurance of identity Nyst in 1836 founded upon a new 

 Belgian Pecten the specific name of Deshayesii, but his fossil must 

 be carefully distinguislied from the American one in question. 

 Having seen but one example of Lea's species I am unable to 

 make the proper comparisons. 



Cardita rotunda, lea. Contr. p. 70, pi 2, fig. 48, as Veiiericardia. 



This species very closely resembles tlie Cardita imhricata of 

 Lamarck, to which, in the absence of specimens, it is with some 

 hesitation referred by Nyst (p. 209), and also by Bronn {Index 

 Palaeontologicus, 1. 226). The only difference that I could detect 

 between the two species, on an examination of numerous speci- 

 mens from Grignon, France, and Claiborne, Ala., was that in the 

 C. imhricata there was a tendency in the ribs of the posterior slope 

 to become crowded. As some specimens of both forms, however, 

 could not readily be distinguished from each other, I believe this 

 circumstance to be mainly accidental, and therefore consider the 

 C. rotunda as certainly nothing more than a mere variety of C. 

 imhricata. 

 Cardita planicosta, Lamk. 



This species of Cardita. which is so extensive! 3' distributed over 

 the Eocene deposits of Europe, is certainl}- identical with the simi- 

 lar forms of Cardita found in the same formation of the United 

 States. Lea (Cont. p. 19) states that according to his observa- 

 tions the American species differs from the European in the num- 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 221 



ber of its costse (about 29 instead of 34), hut on an examination 

 of numerous French specimens I found the number to be frequently 

 only 29. 



Cardium Nicolleti, Conrad. J. A. N. S., viii. p. 190. 



This Cardium will, I believe, on close examination prove to be 

 the C. semigranulatum of Sowerb}' (Mineral Conchology, II. p. 

 99). It does not differ from a species of Cardium in the Academy 

 Museum marked ''C semisfriatum, London Cla}-,'' but as the C. 

 semistriatum, Deshaj'es, differs in the arrangement of its granu- 

 lated strise from the specimen in question marked semistriatum, 

 and as the last agrees in chaiacters with the description accorded 

 b}' Sowerby to C. semigranulatum, it is highly probable that the 

 names have been simph' reversed. 



Corbis (Gafrarium) lirata, Con. A. J. Science, I., 2d ser. p. 401. 



This species was originally described by Conrad as the C. lamel- 

 losa, Lam., with the characters of which it was found to agree in all 

 essential respects. I have been unable to note an\' material differ- 

 ence between the two species in question, and do not hesitate, after 

 an examination of a number of specimens representing Lamarck's 

 tj'pe, to unite the two under the one specific name of lamellosa. 

 Limopsia ellipsis, Lea. Contr. p. 78, pi. 3, fig. 56, as Pectuncnlus. 



This species closely resembles in general characters the L. 

 (Stalagmium !) Xystii of Guleotti, from which it mainl}- differs in 

 the greater number of teeth both in the anterior and posterior 

 series, the number in each series rarely falling below twelve. 



Limopsis aviculoides, Con. Foss. Shells of Tert., p. 39, as Pectuncuhis. 

 (Pectunculus ohliquus, Lea.) 



Bronn {Index Falaeonf., ii., p. 936) allies this species with the 

 Limopsis nana of Deshayes, from which it differs very materially'- 

 in the greater elevation of the umbones and cardinal region. Nj'st 

 considers it as closely related to TrigonoceeJia auritoides, Gal., 

 l>ut the obliquity in form is much greater in the American species. 

 It differs from the Limopsis aurila of Sassi (Area aurita, Broc- 

 chi, '■'• Conchiologia Fussile Subapennina,"" ii., p. 485) in having a 

 crenulated margin. 



Corbala oniscas, Con. A. J. Science xxiii., p. 341. 

 C. M'/rchixonii, Lea. 



This species is referred l»y Bronn {Index Paleeont.) to the C. 

 rugosa of Lamarck, to the description of wliich, as given by L>es- 




222 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



hajes {'■'■Coquilles Fossiles,^^ i., p. 51) it agrees in all essential 

 respects. As in the case of the French species it frequently re- 

 solves itself into two layers, the inner of which may at first sight 

 be readily mistaken for a new species (Cbicostata? Nyst). The 

 C. gibba, Olivi, which, according to Nyst, is the equivalent of G. 

 3furchisonn, Lea, is a Miocene (?), Pliocene, and living species. 

 I have been unable to institute direct comparisons -for want of 

 specimens. 

 Cytherea Mortoni, Con. J. A. N. S., vii., p. 150. 



This species of Cytherea was originally confoumled by Conrad 

 with the G. erycinoides^ Lam. (Foss. Shells of Tert., 1832, p. 34), 

 but a close examination shows the latter to be comparatively more 

 elevated, and its ribs to be proportionately much more robust. 

 Trochita trochiformis, Lea. Contr., p. 96, pi. 3, fig. 76. 



This species, described as wqs^ by Mr. Lea in 1833, is synony- 

 mous with T. {Galyptreea) trochiformin of Lamarck (Trochus 

 apertus, Brand,). 



Cylichna galba, Con. Foss. Shells of Tert., p. 3-4, as Volvaria. 

 (Bulla St. Hillairii, Lea.) 

 This species appears to me to be erroneously referred b}' Bronn 

 to Bulla constricta, Sow. (Miner. Conch., vol. v., p. 96), as 

 Sowerb3''s species has no fold on the columella, at least no men- 

 tion is made of it in his description, nor does it appear in his 

 figure. Our species ayjpears to be closely allied to if not identical 

 -w'llh Bulla B7'occhii,Bronn,an Italian (.Miocene?) species (Brocchi, 

 Gonch. Foss. Subajjemi., ii., p. 277, as Bulla ovulata? Lam.). 



Cyprsedia fene&tralis, Con. Proc. A. N. S , vii. p. 262. 



This appears to me to be identical with Gyprsea (Lupouia, 

 Gray) elegans of Defrance, from which I cannot discover an}- dis- 

 tinguishing characters. Conrad states that no mention is made 

 by Deshayes in his description of the fossil of the Paris basin of 

 "microscopical regular lines," but an examination of a specimen 

 in the Academy collection shows them to be present. 



Tornatella (Actaeon) pomilia, Con. Foss. Shells of Tert.. p. 45. 



Actwon punctatuii, Lea. 



Monoptygma elegans, Lea. 

 ^Tornatella inflata? Ferussac. 



Tornatella (Tornatellaea) bella, Con. 



A comparison of this species with Sowerby's description and 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 223 



figure of Actseon simulatus (Bulla simulala^ Brander) leaves no 

 doubt that the two species are identical. Nor does a comparison 

 of actual specimens, from Alabama and Barton, England, show 

 any varying characters. , 



Fasus (Bulbifusus) inauratus, Con. Foss. Shells of Tert., p. 29. 



This species is more closely allied to F. hulbiformis, Lara., than 

 to F. ficulneus^ Lam., to which last it is doubtfuU}' referred by 

 Bronn (p. 512). It differs from the former, however, in having 

 the canal more produced, in the whorls being strongly subangulate 

 above, and in the superior ones being crcnulated on their basal 

 margins. 



Pyrula penita, Con. Foss. Shells of Tert., p 32. 

 P. tricarinata^ Cou. 

 P. cancellata, Lea. 

 P. elegantissi/na, Lea. 



I am disposed to consider the above as identical with Pyrula 

 nexilis, Lara, (and var. P. tricarinala^ Lara.), which is a most 

 variable fossil. Both American and European forms appear in 

 the most diverse stages of convexit}^ and angulation. Conrad, 

 although he subsequently separated the transatlantic forms 

 into two distinct species, states (Foss. Shells of Tert., 2d ed., p. 

 39), "that the variety is not distinct I am assured b}' comparison 

 of many specimens." I am also inclined to unite with the above 

 the P. (Fusus) 3Iississippiensis, Con. 



Oliva bombylis, Con. Foss. Shells of Tert., 2d ed , p. 42. 

 (0. cunxtricta. Lea.) 



Differs from the 0. niilreola^ Lam., in having the plications at 

 base less numerous and somewliat less regular, and in wanting the 

 upper of the two impressed revolving lines on the boily whorl. 

 In the absence of the line it agrees more closely with 0. nitidula, 

 which was separated b}' Deshayes from tlie 0. milreola as a dis- 

 tinct species. The 0. Brocchii^ Bronn {Volula it<pidula^ L. var. 

 Brocchi ^'' Conch. Fosi^. Subajjenn.,^^ ii., p. 315, pi. iii., tig. IG), which 

 is as well a Miocene, and i)erhaps even living species (Bronn, iii., 

 p. 481), appears to be very clearly related to our species. 



Cancellaria tortiplica, Con. Am. Journ. of Conchol., vol. i., p. 211. 



On an examination of specimens of this species and C. evulsa, 

 Blander (from Barton, England) I find the two to be most inti- 

 mately allied to each other, the main difference being that the C. 




224 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



tortiplica is somewhat more slender and elevated. As this may 

 be only an accidental feature in the few examples which have come 

 under my notice, I feel but little hesitation in uniting the two as 

 one species. Bronn and X3sl;(p. 477) refer with some doubt the 

 C.parva of Lea to Brander's t3'pe, but this diminutive Alabama 

 species has only two plaits on the columella, and is destitute of 

 varices. 



Niso umbilicata, Lea. Contr., p. 103, as Tasithea. 

 Niio terebellatus, Lamk. 



I have been unable to detect the slightest difference between 

 specimens obtained from both species. 



Sigaretus canaliculatus, Sow. Min. Conch., iv., p. 115. 



This shell is mentioned by Conrad (Foss. Shells of Tert., 2d ed., 

 p. 34) as occurring at Claiborne, Ala. It is probably identical 

 with S. declivus and S. bilix, Con., which differ among themselves 

 about as much as they do from the European species. 



Solarium ornatum, Lea. Contr., p. 120. 



This species is placed without doubt by Bronn (ii., p. 1153) as 

 synonymous with S. canaliculatum, Lam. The description and 

 figures as given b}" Desliaj^es {.Goqu. -^oss., ii., p. 221) answer per- 

 fectly to the American species, and I feel no doubt but that an 

 examination of specimens of both species will prove their identity. 

 The S. canaliculafum is mentioned by Conrad (Foss. Shells of 

 Tert., 2d ed., p. 34) as occurring in the Alabama Eocene deposits. 



Pleurotoma denticula, Bast. Descrip. Geol. du Bass. Ter. Sud-ouest de la France, 

 1825, p. 63. 



On a comparison of specimens of the P. nodo-carinata, Gabb 

 (J. A. N. S., 2d series, vol. iv., p. 379), with the exhaustive analysis 

 of the above species as given by Mr. F. E. Edwards in his " Mono- 

 graph of the Eocene MoUusca" of England (Reports of the 

 Palaeontographical Societ}-), I feel no hesitation in including it 

 among the numerous varieties of Basterot's species. No mention 

 is made by Gabb of a division of the central crenulation into a 

 double series, but at least some of the specimens deposited in the 

 Academy Museum, and marked with his specific name, show this 

 feature distinctl3\ The P. denticula is a very widel}' distributed 

 species of Pleurotoma, its range in Europe extending from Eng-

 Foss. del Piem.,^^ Memorie della Reale Accademia di Torino, 2d 

 ser.. vol. ix., p. 576). This species corresponds probabl}' to some 

 extent with Sowerby's P. comma. Unquestionable specimens of 

 P. denticula from the Eocene of Alabama are to be found in the 

 American Museum of Natural History of New York. 

 Mesostoma rugosa, nob. Proc. A. N. S., Oct. 1879. 



This species might readily be mistaken for the JI. grata^ Desh., 

 of the Paris basin, from which it differs only in the greater num- 

 ber of its revolving ridges. 

 Melania Claibornensis, nob. Proc. A. N. S., Oct. 1879. 



This diminutive 3Ielania, which to my knowledge constitutes 

 the onl}^ essentially fresh-water gasteropod found to the present 

 time in the Claiborne marine formation, cannot in its characters 

 be readily distinguished from the 31. mixta, Desh., of the Paris 

 basin (description and fig. in Desh. '•'•Animaux s. vert.''''). Having 

 observed but on'e specimen, and not wishing to definitely deduce 

 its affinities from the characters drawn from a single example, I 

 have provisionally applied to the American shell the specific name 

 which it bears above. 



A close comparison of the Eocene mollusca of the east and west 

 Atlantic shores will, I am confident, reveal a larger number of 

 identical forms than those enumerated in the above list. The 

 Naticidse and Pectunculidae, two families requiring acute revision, 

 appear more especially to be intimately related in their specific 

 forms.

EEVISION OF THE PAL2E0CRINOIDEA. 



by charles wachsmuth and frank springer. 



Introduction. 



According to Miller's catalogue of American paleozoic fossils, 

 there have been described, in this country alone, up to the summer 

 of 1877, about 800 species of Crinoids, not including Blastoids ami 

 Cystideans. If we add to thisnumbersome400 species from Europe 

 — an estimate which is certainly not exaggerated when we remem- 

 ber that Schultze described from the Devonian of the Eifel alone 

 *JS species ; DeKoninck and Le Hon from Belgium 45 ; and An- 

 gelin from the Silurian of Sweden 176 — w^e have from both coun- 

 tries about 1250 species. Making due allowance for s^'iionyms, 

 we have possibly 1000 good species, which are distributed among 

 from 150 to 175 genera. Man}' of the latter were established at 

 a time when our knowledge of the Crinoids was in its infancy. 

 They were frequently founded upon one or two species, often, in- 

 deed, on a single imperfect specimen ; which resulted in many de- 

 fective, insufficient, and not unfrequently incorrect descriptions, 

 producing endless perplexing complications afterwards 



There was a time when nearly every fossil Crinoid was Encri- 

 nites. This was the case almost until 1821, when J. S. Miller de- 

 scribed his well-known genera Poteriocrinuft, Actinoci'itius, Pla- 

 tycrimis^ Rhodocririus, and C>/athocrinu^, which have been uni- 

 versally adopted by the later paleontologists — with the exception, 

 perhaps, of Cyathocrinus^ which was badl}* defined by him. As 

 new species were discovered, the founding of additional genera 

 progressed, and generic distinctions came to be recognized be- 

 tween groups of forms, which substantially agreed in the arrange- 

 ment of the plates of the body, but differed in the anal plates, 

 the construction of the arms, and other characters to which but 

 little attention had before been paid. Through such separations 

 it resulted in many cases that the parental genus was divided up 

 into a number of genera, and it final!}" became evident that some 

 of the features which had been considered of mere generic im- 

 portance, were famil}' characters. The majority of the genera 

 thus established have been adopted by most of our leading pale-

ontologists, but by some entirel\' ignored. It is a singular fact 

 tliat European authors have commonly refused to accept our 

 genera of Actinocrinidae, while they sustained those of the Cya- 

 thocrinidse. which are certainly no better defined. This is doubt- 

 less due to the fact tliat in Europe the Aclinocrinidae do not 

 abound in such wonderful variety as in this country. If our 

 European brethren had to deal with nearly 300 species, as we 

 Lave, they would perhaps be more ready to accept our divisions. 



As early as 1842 T. Austin and T. Austin, Jr. (Rec. & Foss. 

 Crinoidea), undertook to subdivide the Crinoidea into families, but 

 they were not very successful, as they placed together types of 

 very distinct groups. Roemer (Lethsea Geognostica, 18.5.5, 3d 

 Ausgabe) made another attempt in the same direction. He was 

 the first author who pointed out correctly the relations of the 

 Blastoids and Cystideaus with the true Crinoids : and, if he was 

 not so fortunate in establishing his families, we must consider 

 how imperfectly Crinoids were known at that time. Some of 

 Roemer's family names are still in use, but scarcely two of our 

 jDresent authors interpret them alike. 



The late Prof. Angelin^ divided the Silurian Crinoids of Sweden 

 into four sections: Trimera, Teti-amera, Pentamera, and Poly- 

 mera. A subdivision according to the number of basal plates 

 ma}' facilitate elementary studies, but it is certainl}- not a natural 



classification. Genera which are evideirtly intimatelj* related 



for instance, Platyc7-inus and Dichocrinus, Melocrinus and Rho- 

 docrinus — are thereby widely separated, while very distinct types, 

 such as Rhodocrinns and Poleriocrinus, are brought together. 

 Angelin arranged his 40 genera of Swedish Crinoids under 23 

 families ; but, as he gave no diagnoses of them, we are at a loss 

 to know upon what principle his families were established. 



In the second part of an article on the " Internal and External 

 Structure of Paleozoic Crinoids," by Chas. Wachsrauth, published 

 in the August and September numbers of the Amer. Journ. Sci., 

 1877, one of the writers gave a minute description of the summit 



' In the Iconographia Crinoideorum in stratis Sueeice Siluricis fossilium, 

 auctore N. P. Angelin, opus posthumum edendum curavit Reoria Academia 

 Suecise, cum tabulis XXIX. This is one of the finest illustrated works on 

 Crinoids that has ever been published, and it must be regarded as a great 

 loss to science that the distinguished author died before the completion of 

 Lis work.

or ventral disk of the earlier Crinoids, and reached the conclusion 

 that the construction of the vault affords good characters for a 

 separation into families. He distinguished three principal plans 

 . — though he admitted the existence of a number of others — upon 

 which the summit is constructed : — 



1. The summit composed of a more or less pliable, sometimes 

 perhaps squamous, integument, yielding to motion in the body 

 and arms. 



2. The summit composed of solid plates with a porous ventral 

 sac, located posteriorly on the disc, and closed at the top. Anal 

 opening rarely observed, but probably lateral. 



3. The summit composed of heavy immovable plates, closely 

 joining and forming a dome arching the entire oral side. Anal 

 opening directly through the wall of the dome or at the extremi- 

 ty of a tube, the so-called proboscis. 



We have since given this subject our special attention, and find 

 that these diversities in the construction of the ventral portion of 

 the body bear a striking relation to the general arrangement of 

 the plates of the dorsal side ; that the parental genera to which 

 we have referred have each their own peculiar summit structure, 

 and that the genera into which they were subsequently subdivided 

 are characterized by mere differentiations of the original plan. 

 We find that Ichthyocrinus and its congeners, Taxocrinits, 3Ies- 

 pilocrinus, etc., which are embraced in almost the same generic 

 formula, possess summit structure No. 1 ; that in Cyathocrinus^ 

 Foteriocrinus, Heterocriniis, and all genera with five basals, five 

 subradials, and five radials, the summit structure agrees with No. 

 2; and that the Actinocrinidee^ Platycrinidse^ and Rhodocrinidae^ 

 with their numerous genera, are constructed like No. 3. We con- 

 sider that the last three groups are subdivisions of one great group, 

 and propose to introduce them hereafter as subfamilies. These 

 three, or, as we may say, five families thus indicated, include more 

 than one-half of all known paleozoic Crinoids. The others we 

 leave for future consideration. 



The absence of an external oral aperture is most remarkable in 

 the anatomy of the earlier Crinoids. The actinostome, or oral 

 centre, is situated beneath the vault, and forms the radial centre 

 of a peculiar skeleton of tubular passages which connect with the 

 arms. These passages beneath the vault are evidently homo- 

 logous with the food grooves and ambulacral canals at the peris- 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 229 



tome of recent Crinoids, the vault being thus a mere covering or 

 protection. That the mouth was internal in the majority, if not 

 all paleozoic Crinoids, as well as all tlie Cystideans and Blastoids, 

 is ver}' significant, and impresses us most forciblj' with the idea 

 that the earlier Crinoids form a distinct group, and that the solid 

 covering ma}- have been essential under the conditions that pre- 

 vailed in paleozoic times. 



The genus Lichinocrimis, which Hall describes from the Lower 

 Silurian of Cincinnati, affords an instructive example in this 

 respect. In this interesting form, the oral or ventral side was 

 always attached to a shell, coral or other foreign substance; the 

 dorsal side has a long stem, but whether this was attached to the 

 bottom or not, is not known. The oral side, when found detached, 

 which is of very rare occurrence, shows a large number of striae, 

 which converge to a very small opening in the centre. According 

 to our interpretation, this opening is the mouth, the striae the food 

 passages, and the shell to which the ventral side is attached, takes 

 the place of the vault, which is as yet undeveloped. 



Another very characteristic distinction between ancient and 

 recent Crinoids is to be found in the com pa rati vel}-^ large size and 

 massive body plates in the fossil, contrasted with the diminutive 

 body and ver}' long and highly developed arms of recent types ; 

 and the same is even more strikinglj^ true as to Blastoids and 

 Cystideans. To illustrate, we might say that in the Pentacrinidse 

 they are fully developed ; that the}^ are in progress of growth in 

 paleozoic Crinoids, and that they are only budding or sprouting 

 in Blastoids and Cystideans; while in Lichinocrinus, which is 

 probably still lower in the scale of organization, the arms have 

 not yet made their appearance. 



Upon these distinctions, principally, Wachsrauth (Am. Journ. 

 Sci., Sept. 1877, p. 190) proposed to separate the paleozoic from 

 the recent Crinoids, under the name PALiEOCRiNOiDEA, as a sub- 

 order of the Crinoids, of equal rank with the Blastoidea and 

 Cystidea. 



To facilitate a better understanding of the two groups, we now 

 direct attention to certain organs which have been known to exist 

 in Cystideans and Blastoids, and whicli we think existed in a 

 modified form in the Paleocrinoids. These organs, which were 

 called " hydrospires" by Billings (Am, Journ. Sci., Jul}', 18G9, p. 

 75), occupy rather large spaces within the body in the first-named 




230 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



groups, and -this ma}' perhaps explain in a measure the compara- 

 tively large size of the calyx in the older Crinoids generally. The 

 hj'drospires were located within the perivisceral cavity, connected 

 with the inner floor of the test, and communicated, so far as ascer- 

 tained, through the test with the outside water. In the Cystideans 

 the hj-drospires are of a rhomboidal shape — each rliomb being 

 divided into two triangles b}' a suture between two of the plates 

 (PI. 17, Figs. 7, 8.). In Ca?'?/ocrinMsorna^u8, each of the four sides 

 of the rhombs is bordered bj- a row of small tubercles (PI. 17, Fig. 

 6), some of which have a single pore in the apex, while others are 

 perforated by two to twenty or more. The pores penetrate through 

 the plates, but do not communicate directl}' with the visceral cavity 

 of the body. Internall}', each hj'drospire consists of a number of 

 flattened tubes, arranged parallel to each otiiei', and each tube re- 

 ceives two of the pores, one at each end. In a large h3-drospire, 

 there are about twent}' or more tubes. Whatever may have been 

 the special function of these" tul)es, naturalists generally agree 

 that the}- belong to the respiratory system, and we infer from the 

 distril)ution of the pores in variable numbers at and about tiie 

 apices of the tubercles, that they very probably served as a madre- 

 poric apparatus, through which water for respiration was intro- 

 duced and expelled. In other genera of the Cystideans, we find 

 in the test one or more striated rhombs with fissures and pores, 

 somewhat resembling the madreporic body of other Echinoderms. 

 In the Blastoids, there are certain orifices arranged around the 

 actinal pole, which have been called ovarian apertures on account 

 of their supposed resemblance to similar openings in the Ophiu- 

 rans, but if they were connected with the reproductive organs, 

 which is by no means proved, they evidently had additional im- 

 portant functions. These openings api)ear in various forms. We 

 find in the earlier types fissures arranged on the upper portion of 

 the body ; at a later period slits along each side of the ambulacra, 

 and in the latest and higher types, five pairs of orifices which 

 surround the oral centre. None of these openings communicate 

 with the general cavity of the body, but they all connect with 

 peculiar organs closely resembling the internal tubes of Caryo- 

 O'iniis^ and which are also called " hydrospires." The hydrospires 

 of the Blastoids, though actually arranged interradially, are 

 located beneath the ambulacra, and occupy the perivisceral cavity, 

 extending laterally for some distance beyond the sinus along the 




1870.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 231 



iiHUT side of the forked plate. In most genera, tlie}' are con- 

 structed upon the same general plan. There are ten sacs (com- 

 pare PI. 17, Fig. 5) which do not connect with each other, disposed 

 in pairs, one pair to each aml)ulacrnm, and each pair separated by 

 tl»e lancet piece. Toward the visceral eavit}', they are folded into 

 a number of longitudinal i)lications, which show neither pores nor 

 passages. The inner and outer folds alternate with eacli other, 

 and are distended at their closed ends. On approaching the apex 

 of the body, they coalesce to form two separate sets of tubes. 

 The tubes from the inner folds are formed by the adhesion of the 

 walls of the outer, and, vice verm, so that the folds which open 

 toward the visceral cavity give rise to the outer set of tubes, while 

 those opening in tlie oi)posite direction become tlie inner tubes. 

 The former terminate wiil:in coridors leading to the so-called 

 ovarian orifices, those of each two adjoining hydrospires of two 

 dilferent ambulacra terminating in one orifice; while the latter 

 communicate with an annular organ located against the inner wall 

 of the test and surrounding the oral centre. The number of folds 

 varies from three to nine or more. Tiie walls of the sacs, which 

 were evidently composed of fine membranous substance, must 

 have been strengthened by the secretion of calcareous particles, 

 or they would not be found so well preserved •, and they were 

 flexible since we find the folds in various degrees of expansion, 

 7/1 Codasler, one of the earliest and probalily one of the lowest 

 type of the Blastoids, and in CWo/nVf'fe-, its subcarboniferous repre- 

 sentative, there is in place of the folded sacs a large number of 

 tubes placed side by side, and arranged parallel with the external 

 fissures or grooves. This structure of the hydrospires so elosely 

 resembles that of some of the Cystideans that Billings proposed 

 to remove Codasler from the Blastoids and place it among the 

 Cystideans. Tiiis we cannot end<M-se, but we do agree with him, 

 that whatever may have been the functions of the calycine pores, 

 pectinated rliomljs, and internal tubes in the Cystiileans, tliose of 

 the parallel tulies or folded sacs in the Blastoids must have been 

 ver}' similar if not identical.'

232 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



No such organs have ever been described in the true Crinoids 

 neither from the Palaeocrinoidea nor the Pentacrinidae. 



We have given so minute a description of the hydrospires as 

 they occur in the Cystideans and Blastoids, partly because they 

 have been indifFerentl}'' known, but also in order that we may bet- 

 ter compare with them certain organic structures, which we have 

 discovered in some Paleocrinoids, and which we think still further 

 distinguish the latter from recent Crinoids, while at the same 

 time indicating a closer relationship with the Blastoids and 

 Cystideans. 



Wachsmuth, in Am, Journ. Sci., Aug. 18tT, p. 126, noted a 

 marked difference between the proboscis in the Actinocrinidse and 

 that in the Cyathocrinulee. He considered the former a mere 

 anal tube, or prolongation of the anal opening ; but this organ in 

 the Cyathocrinidse he believed to be an essential part of the body, 

 in which the anal oi^ening, here located laterally and low down, is 

 of but secondary importance, and therefore proposed to call it 

 " ventral sac" instead of proboscis. We have since had occasion 

 to examine the ventral sac in several most excellent specimens, 

 particularly with reference to the pores to which he called atten- 

 tion, and have become convinced that these are very probabl}' the 

 homologues of the cal3X-ine pores in the C^'stideans. The plates 

 of the ventral sac in the Cyathocrinidse are usually comparatively 

 large, rather thin, hexagonal pieces, longitudinally arranged, alter- 

 nating with those of the adjoining rows. The pores perforate the 

 plate at each angle. It is now very interesting to observe that in 

 some species — for instance, Poteriocrinus 3Iissouriensis, Shum. 

 Fot. {Scaphiocrinusyunicus Hall, there are in place of the pores 

 slit-like fissures of considerable length. Four of these fissures — 

 sometimes six — connect with those of the plates of the adjacent 

 row, those of each half of a plate meeting corresponding slits in 

 two different plates, so that one half of the fissures point upward 

 and the other downward. We have filed several of the plates to 

 the very bottom, and have found that the fissures pass entirely 

 through them, and in many cases, where they have been observed, 

 they form longitudinal depressions along the ventral sac, caused 

 by the thinning of the plates toward the fissures. In some species, 



that tliey form excellent generic distinctions. It is really astonishing how 

 beautifully iu some instances, these delicate organs have been preserved. 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 233 



the fissures occur not only at the lateral, but also at the upper 

 and lower sides of the plates, meeting here in like manner with 

 the slits of the adjoining plates. In species in which the plates 

 are provided with three slits to a side, the median one is larger 

 than the other two, thus forming with the corresponding slits of 

 the adjoining plate the figure of a quadrangle or rhomb, divided 

 into two triangles, exactly as Billings describes the parallel canals 

 which compose the hydrospires in Caryocrinus. Indeed, the simi- 

 larity which seems to exist in this respect between the two groups, 

 is so striking, that we can scarcely doubt that both structures 

 were adapted to the performance of the same functions. It is 

 true that the Indrospires in Caryocrinus are located on the aboral, 

 and in the Cyalhocrinidse on the oral side of the bodj-, but it must 

 be remembered, as aireadj' shown (Am. Journ. Sci., Sept, 1877, p. 

 190) that the entire test of paleozoic Crinoids forms a part of the 

 abactinal system, and the position of the hydrospires in Cysti- 

 deans is hy no means confined to the aboral side, nor to the oral 

 in Paleocrinoids. We find in the genus Forocrinus, Billings, 

 Avhich forms a kind of link between Cystideans and Paleocrinoids 

 (the arrangement of the plates of the calyx is exactly like that of 

 all Ci/athocrinidae), that the h^'drospires are altogether confined 

 to the calyx. In the sutures between the plates, there exist a 

 number of striated, poriferous areas, resembling the pectinated 

 rhombs in their structure, and though their form and position are 

 somewhat different from those of any other known Crinoid or 

 Cystidean, there can be no doubt that the}- performed in the 

 animal tlie same office, TJnfortunatel}' we do not know whether 

 this genus had a poriferous ventral sac; nor have we been able to 

 ascertain whether the longitudinal depressions on the ventral sac 

 which we have noticed above, were covered — perhaps b^' perforated 

 plates, such as Billings observed upon the tubercles of Caryocri- 

 nus — or only the pores and fissures, but we are inclined to think 

 the former was the case, since we found in some other specimens of 

 P. U7ncus.no depressions, but at the same time no fissures nor pores. 

 In many of the Actinocrinidae, Flatycinidae, and Rhodocrinidae^ 

 which are |)rovided with a simple anal tulie or an anal openiin' 

 directl}- through the vault, the respirator}' organs were probably 

 located within the main body, at least there are many facts which 

 seem to indicate this. In an article on page 248 of the Proceed- 

 ings of the Acad. Xat. Sci. Phila., 18T8, we noted the existence 

 16 



k 




234 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1879. 



of certain pores or openings located betAveen tlie arm bases and 

 separated from the arm passages by a thin partition. Their num- 

 ber varies fi'om ten to twenty or more. In Batocrinus, where 

 the}- are most conspicuous, there are twenty, no matter whether 

 the species has more or less than twenty arms. The}^ are about 

 one-third the size of the arm passages, with which they are in 

 very near the same horizontal plane. There are two pores to 

 each interradial field, one to the left of one arm,, and one to the 

 right of another. Ten other pores have a radial position, two 

 witliin each of the five axillary spaces which form the median 

 portion of the rays. In Strotocrinua^ which has an enormous 

 body, each arm has a pore, and so in Sfeganocrinus, Eueladocri- 

 niis^ and apparently in all genera in which the arms branch off 

 alternatel}'. Other genera have only ten pores. In Ollacrinus 

 the pores are represented by two longitudinal passages through 

 the tubular extensions of the interradial series, or the false arms 

 as usually called. 



As these openings, especially' in Batocrimis^ are comparatively 

 large, it is somewhat surprising that they have never been men- 

 tioned by other paleontologists. Their position correspondsalmost 

 exactl}^ with that of the so-called ovarian apertures of the Blas- 

 toids though they are placed at a greater distance from the radial 

 centre. The openings in both groups are situated within the 

 brachial zone or at the extreme border of the summit. In the 

 Blastoids the ventral disc or summit is reduced to the minimum 

 in size, being composed only of the covering of the ventral open- 

 ing ; and this explains wh}- the orifices are here found close to the 

 radial centre, while in the forms above named they are located 

 away from it. The pseudambulacral fields of the Blastoids rei)re- 

 sent the ventral groove of a recumbent arm, and the small pas- 

 sages which enter the body near the apex and beneath the central 

 covering are the homologues of the arm passages in the true 

 Crinoids. (Compare PI. IT, Fig. 4.) The so-called ovarian oi)en- 

 ings are therefore located beside the arms, just as the pores in Balo- 

 crinus. and this strongl}' indicates a similarit\' in their functions. 



In addition to this the perivisceral cavit}' in the Actinocrinidse 

 contains a number of chambers, and, from the brachial zone down 

 to the base, is separated from the visceral cavit}' l\v a peculiar 

 partition or network, pierced b}- innumerable pores and passages 

 leading toward the visceral cavity which contains the digestive 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 235 



apparatus. Whether the above described pores communicated 

 with these chambers cannot be determined from the fossil, but we 

 may perhaps infer this from their position, and also that the 

 chambers themselves were or contained organs similar to those 

 described as h3drospires in other groups of the Crinoidea. 



Folded sacs or parallel tul)es, as in the Blastoids, have not 

 hitherto been noticed in the Pahieocrinoidea. That they existed 

 in some groups of tlie latter is almost certain. The so-called 

 "consolidating api)aratus" of Cupi'essoci'inus (PI. IT, Fig. 3) is 

 in our opinion a true set of hydrospires, arranged in pairs exactly 

 as in Blastoids, but spreading out horizontally instead of verti- 

 call}-. Angelin (Iconogr. Crin., PL VIII. Fig. 7, a, 6) figures a 

 Crotalocrinus, in which the consolidating apparatus — or hydro- 

 spires, as we believe — is most excellentl}' preserved. Even the 

 inner tubes can be traced, and, if there existed still a doubt 

 whether the closely related Cupresi^ocrinus had its ventral side 

 firmly closed, Angelin's figure, PI. YIII. Fig. 6, ought to remove 

 it. There seems to be in Crolalocrinus not onl}" a solid inteofu- 

 ment covering the entire ventral disc and inclosing the hydro- 

 spires, but we judge from Fig. 7 of the preceding plate, that the 

 oral centre or median space between the hydrospires had even a 

 double covering. 



It seems to us that there can scarcely be a douI)t but that the 

 consolidating plates of Cyathocrinus (PI. 17, Fig. 2; are homo- 

 logous with the oral plates of the Pentacrinoid larva (PI. 17, Fig. 

 1), and ought to be designated as such; and further, that the 

 so-called consolidating plates of Cupressocri7ius are the homo- 

 logucs of the deltoid pieces of the Blastoids (PI. 17, Fig. 4). 

 It will be seen that all four occupy the same relative position in 

 the respective types. There are five interradial plates, which join 

 at tiieir sides, extending inward, but so as to leave an opening at 

 the oral centre. The affinities, indeed, are so striking that Ave 

 think it not unreasonable to suppose that the h3-drospires are 

 metamorphosed oral plates. The construction of the deltoid 

 pieces is very complicated, only the median or deltoid portion 

 being visible externally. They are extended laterally, in spade- 

 shaped appendages (PI. 17, Fig. 4), which pass under the am. 

 bulacral fields and are hidden by them. To these appendages the 

 folds of the hydrospires are attached, being suspended on each 

 side of the ambulacrum, or modified arm, and partlj' covered by 




236 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



it. In the so-called consolidating plates of Cupressocrinus we 

 find precisely the same structure. Each plate has lateral exten- 

 sions, each of which supports a set of folds which incline in op- 

 posite directions. The number of folds varies in different species, 

 Cupressocrinus abbrematus having apparently' seven, and C. gra- 

 cilis but two or three, and so in the Blastoids, Pentremites pyri- 

 formis has seven folds and P. Godoni but five. As the folds of 

 two different plates are not connected laterally, a sort of depres- 

 sion or groove is formed in a radial direction, which evidently 

 contained the food passage, covering the sutures between the 

 plates as the pseudambulacral folds cover those of the deltoid 

 pieces in the Blastoids. The so-called consolidating plates with 

 their folds, of C up)ressocrinus, and the deltoid pieces with their 

 appended hydrospires in Blastoids, being not only analogous 

 in position but also almost identical in structure, it is very evi- 

 dent that they had a similar office in the animal organism, and 

 that if these organs in Blastoids were respirator}^ the hydrospires 

 in Cujjressocrinus and Grotalocrinus had the same functions. 



This view of the relations of the parts under consideration sug- 

 gests a possible analogy in the general structure of Blastoids and 

 Paleocrinoids, in which we may consider that the ambulacrum 

 is a recumbent arm ; the lower part of the forked plate up to the 

 ambulacrum is tlie first radial — in Blastoidocrinus^ the oldest 

 known Blastoid,the suture is visilile — that the two sides of the fork, 

 instead of being interradial, form together a second radial, and 

 the small summit plates are homologous with those which cover 

 the central opening between the oral plates in Cyathocrinus, or to 

 the entire vault in the Actinocrinidae, etc., in which the oral plates 

 do not exist — at least not externall3\ The food groove and ambu- 

 lacral canal are located upon the pseudambulaci'al fold, which 

 represents the ventral groove in the arms of the Crinoids, and are 

 likewise covered by two rows of alternating plates. If these 

 homologies be correct, it is evident that there is a much closer 

 relation between Paleocrinoids and Blastoids in fundamental 

 structure than has been heretofore supposed, and as we find in the 

 former the representatives both of parallel tubes and folded sacs, 

 it is evident that their hydrospires are constructed upon a c^'sti- 

 dean and blastoidean plan combined. 



We have now noticed the principal forms in which these organs 

 have been observed; there are, however, a large number of forms 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 231 



in which no trace of them has as ^-et been discovered. These in- 

 clude among others the Ichthyocrinidae, and a few genera of the 

 Actinocrinidee and Cijathocrinidse. In the Ivhthyocrinidse^ respi- 

 ration ma}' have been carried on through the pliant vault, aided 

 by the expansions and contractions which the flexible nature of 

 the skeleton could produce. In the Actinocrinidae, however, the 

 body, as in the Blastoids, is perfectly rigid, the plates heavy and 

 firmly cemented together. There are no other openings in the 

 body but the anal aperture, the arm passages, a passage through 

 the column and the pores between the arm bases which we have 

 described. In some genera, however, the last-named pores appa- 

 rently do not exist. The introduction of water through tlie anal 

 tube need not be considered for a moment, nor through the arms, 

 which in no group of the Echinoderms perform such an office. Let 

 us examine the column. 



The construction of the column varies in different genera. It 

 is perforated througliout the centre b\'^ a passage connecting with 

 the interior of the body, which in some cases is a simple, small, 

 round opening, while in others it is very large and marked by a 

 peculiarl}' complicated internal structure. In the latter, the tubu- 

 lar cavity extends to all the branches which spring off rather 

 numerously toward the root. It is mostly pentamerous, though 

 in some cases tri- or quadri-partite ; it is sometimes regularly" pen- 

 tagonal, and sometimes divided into five petaloid chambers which 

 unite at the centre. Tlie walls within appear as if built up of thin 

 laminre, with spaces between, sometimes pectinated, and variously 

 sculptured, all producing a great multiplication of exposed sur- 

 faces. In some the articulating faces of the stem segments are 

 covered with strife, radiating from the centre, which resemble 

 minute pores penetrating the walls. We have found the very base 

 of one of these large columns just as it was attached to the rock 

 or other flat surface. It is very broad and deeply channelled on 

 the bottom, and there are numerous branches or unattached cj'rrhi, 

 all of which are iierforated, and through which there was ample 

 communication with the surrounding water. In addition to this, 

 there are large pores near the base of the column, leading from with- 

 out into the main cavitj' directly through the walls. 



Such an extraordinary structure was not necessary, if the column 

 was merel}' an attachment or anchor for the Crinoid. That it was 

 a means of communication between the water outside ami tlie in- 




238 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [18T9. 



ternal organs of the body for some purpose we entertain no doubt, 

 and the large amount of surface exposed by means of the complex 

 lamellar structure, is strongly' suggestive of the principle which 

 prevails in the respiratory apparatus in the animal kingdom gener- 

 siUy. We have said that some Actinocrinidae probably do not 

 possess the pores in the body. It is very significant tliat it is in 

 these very forms that we find columns such as we have just descrilied. 

 Indeed, in general, so far as we have been able to observe, we have 

 found it to be tlie rule, tliat those types which have a perforated 

 ventral sac are without pores in the cal^^x; that those with caly- 

 cine pores do not possess a perforated ventral sac, and that in 

 forms with a flexible vault, or with perforated ventral sac, or with 

 pores in the body walls, the column is generally destitute of any 

 such complex structure, and has only a small, simple aperture. 

 There may be exceptions to this ; in fact we know of some, but 

 these relate exclusively to very large species, in which the open- 

 ings in the main body, which we suppose to be respiratory pas- 

 sages, are inadequate to supply the immense body. The most re- 

 markable examples of this kind are Megiatocrinus and Barycrinus. 

 The former, which belongs to the Actinocrinidae^ has species with 

 larger bodily capacity than has been discovered in any other genus. 

 It has generall}' only ten primary arms, and most probably only 

 ten respiratory pores in the body. Barycrinus attains by far the 

 greatest size of the Gyathocrinidse^ and the column of this genus 

 like that of Megistocrinus is not onl}^ very strong, but its central 

 cavit}'- is exceedingly' large and complicated. We thus have in 

 these two genera apparently another mode of communication from 

 the outside, which xnhy have been either a cause or an effect of 

 their extreme size. 



All these facts have led us to suppose that the column was in 

 some cases, and perhaps more or less in the Paleocrinoids gener- 

 ally, subservient to respiration. This supposition would not only 

 account for the complicated structure of the column where it ex- 

 its, but furnish a plausible explanation as to how the introduction 

 of water was effected in species in which apparently no other open- 

 ings are present. 



With these observations, which we hope will at least be sug- 

 gestive of some interesting points, and perhaps stimulate more 

 detailed observation, we pass to another matter of considerable 

 importance as bearing upon classification. 




18T9.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 239 



Prof. p. Herbert Carpenter, in a valuable paper (Quarter)}- Journ. 

 Microscop. Sci., vol. xviii (new series), p. 351), on the "Oral and 

 Apical Systems of the Eehinoderms," undertakes to determine the 

 homologies between that system of plates in tlie calcareous skele- 

 ton of the Echini known as apical plates, and certain parts of the 

 calyx of Crinoids, both recent and fossil. He considers the basals 

 of recent Crinoids to be homologous to the genital plates, and the 

 radials to the ocular plates of the Echini, and he traces the horao- 

 log}' to the Pahieocrinoidea, in respect to which, however, he ad- 

 vances the opinion that the first ring of plates resting upon the 

 upper stem segment, which have heretofore been nominated 

 "basals'' are in many types not basals at all. He regards tiie set 

 of plates wliich lie next below the radials as the true "basals," no 

 matter whether they rest directly upon the stem, as in Platyci-inus^ 

 or are separated from it by another ring of plates, as in Cyalho- 

 crinus; so that the "subradials" of most American authors, or 

 " parabasals" as^the}' are generally termed in Europe, are "basals" 

 according to his view. The lowest or proximal ring of plates, in 

 types having "subradials," he calls "umlerbasals," and these he 

 believes to be unrepresented in the other t3pes of Crinoids and all 

 other P]chinoderms. The central plate of the apical system, re- 

 presented b}' the central disk or subanal plate of the Echini, is 

 thought by Carpenter to be the homologue of the terminal joint 

 at the base of the stem in all pedunculated Crinoids, and in the 

 Pentacrinoid larva of Comalula, and of the central plate in Mar- 

 supifef. 



In several respects these views conflict with those of A. Agassiz 

 and Loven, who regard the subanal plate of the Echini as the 

 homologue of the centro-dorsal plate of Comatula; and both these 

 as representing the "basals" of the Crinoids, b}' which term tiie}' 

 designate the first ring of plates above tiie stem in all types. They 

 consider the single plate in the a[)ical s^'steni of the Echini as the 

 equivalent of the basalia of the Crinoids metamorphosed into one. 



Carpenter's reasoning in regard to the basal plates is, that, as 

 the genitals in the Echini, and the basals in most Paleocrinoids, 

 which are generally considered to be their homologues, are situated 

 inlerradiaUy with regard to the general symmetry of the body, 

 we must expect to find the genitals in Paleocrinoids in the same 

 relative position ; and tiiat in forms like Cyalhocrinus, which have 

 two rings of plates below the radials, the lower or proximal plates 




240 PROnEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



are situated in line with the radials, and hence cannot be the true 

 basals. He hohls that the same order of plates cannot be radial 

 in one ffenus and interradial in another. This aro-ument is un- 

 questionably a very strong one, and we are enabled to confirm it 

 by a number of interesting o!)servations. 



Let us consider the first ring of plates resting upon the upper 

 stem joint in Crinoids, where it consists of less than five, as a 

 metamorphosed representative of a set of five plates, in which two 

 or more have been united by anchylosis. It will be observed 

 that in nearly all types with but one ring of plates below the 

 radials, i.e., forms without "subradials," the proximal ring is so 

 placed that the angles alternate with those of the radials, so that 

 the whole set, whether five plates or not, may very appropriately 

 be considered as interradial with regard to the general structure 

 of the body. 



In forms like Plafycrinus, Symbathocrinus ^ etc., in which the 

 radials rest directly upon a basal disc composed pf three unequal 

 plates, if we bisect the two larger, we obtain five equal plates, 

 which occupy an interradial position. This is actuall}' done in 

 Belemnocrinus, which in the apical system has the identical struc- 

 ture of Rhizocrinus, and most of the recent Crinoids, viz., five 

 basals, interradially situated, supporting five radials. 



In Melocrinus and Eucalyplocrinus., where the proximal ring 

 consists of four plates, we may divide the larger one and thus 

 obtain five plates, which, though not wholly regular in form, are 

 all interradial in position. 



In Actinocrinus which has three equal plates in the basal disc, 

 and Dichocrimis which has two, and allied genera, an apparent 

 diflflculty is presented, for if we subdivide tliese plates we have 

 six basals instead of five. But here the structure is precisely the 

 same in principle as in the foregoing cases. The six plates are 

 interradial in position, and the presence of the anal plate in the 

 same range' with the first radials necessitates an additional plate 

 in the basal ring for its support, so that the two plates which sup- 

 port it are equivalent to one. The anal plates are actually nothing 

 more than an interradial series with a special function, viz., the 

 support of the anal apparatus within the bod}', and of an opening 

 in the vault, which may be either directl}' through the test, or 

 prolonged into a tube. In some of the Ichthyocrinidse, the anal 

 is not distinguishable from any interradial series. The presence 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 241 



of the anal series as an element in the stnu-ture of many Paleo- 

 crinoids, may be largely due to the solid dome, which has to be 

 penetrated by a special aperture, requiring some modification of 

 the general structure below to accommodate it. It seems to have 

 no direct representative in the apical system of the recent Echino- 

 derms, but we may be justified in considering it as a specialized 

 interradial, and in that case tlie basals of the forms under con- 

 sideration are found to conform entirely to Carpenter's interpre- 

 tation, being interradially disposed. We find a most interesting 

 confirmation of this view in a specimen of Actinocriniifi {Slroto- 

 cHnus) umbrostis, wliich has abnormallj^ no first anal plate, the 

 first radials jcining at tlieir sides. The anal series in form and 

 proportions is ver}' similar to the other interradials, being chiefly 

 distinguished by having three plates in the second range instead 

 of two, as in the others. Accordingly, we find the basal disc in 

 this specimen reduced to three unequal plates, and if we bisect 

 the two larger, we obtain five equal plates, interradially situated, 

 just as in PIahjc7'i7ius. Nature herself, in this isolated specimen, 

 lias thus beautifully illustrated our argument. It is well to note 

 in this connection that in Plafycrinus, and all genera with three 

 unequal plates in the proximal ring, the small plate is never, so far 

 as we have observed, on the anal side, and this is the case with 

 the abnormal specimen above described, the small plate being 

 situated below the suture of the left posterior and lateral ra^^s. 

 Why this is so we are as ^-et unable to explain. 



In forms like Cyathocrinus^ Bhodocrinus, etc., which have two 

 rings of five plates each, the proximal plates are radially situated, 

 and, therefore, according to Carpenter, cannot be basals or homo- 

 logous to the genitals, but the second ring of plates or " subradials," 

 being interradial in position, are the true basals and the homolo- 

 gues of the genitals. If, now, we examine those types with two 

 rings below the radials, in which the proximal ring consists of less 

 than five plates, we shall find his idea still further confirmed. 



In the Ichthyocrinidse (except Calpiocrinui<?) which have in 

 the proximal ring tiiree unequal plates, the^- are so proportioned 

 and so situated that if we divide them by two additional sutures 

 into five about equal plates, these fice will be radially sihiafed, and 

 exactly equivalent to the corresponding set of plates in Cyatho- 

 crinus. In Gissocriniis, one of Angelin's Upi)er Silurian genera 

 from Gotland, which is in every other respect a true Cyalhocri- 




242 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP £1879. 



nus, there are but thrge unequal plates in the proximal ring, show- 

 ing here an actual metamorphosis of five plates into three. 



Ill Cupresi^ocrinus, which has a single central plate below the 

 "subradials," pierced b}^ the quadripartite perforation of the 

 column, it might at first seem difficult to subdivide the proximal 

 plate in this manner. But it will be noted that it is really radial 

 in position, since its five external angles alternate with those of 

 the "subradials," and furthermore, we find tliat nature has done 

 it for us in a precisel}^ similar case. Myrtillocrinuii, whose base is 

 perforated by a quadrangular foramen, has its proximal ring 

 divided into five small pieces, alternating with "subradials" and 

 hence radial in position, (loth Xew York Regents' Rep., p. 142.) 



It is worthy of note that in the form last discussed — those with 

 two rings below the radials — the proximal plates are almost in- 

 variabl}' ver}- small, and in many cases so minute as to be hidden 

 b}' the column, thus in their insignificance aff'ording an argument 

 against comparing them with the genitals. The^' seem to be early 

 developed, for they are as large in the young as in the adult, and 

 do not show much increase in proportions in later geological 

 epochs. 



In some Cyathocrinidse^ the proximal ring sometimes attains con- 

 siderable proportionate size, and it seems to have developed in 

 geological time, for we find in the Lower Silurian genus Helero- 

 crinus that this set of plates is represented in an extremeh' rudi- 

 mentary stage, being only faintl}' visible between the sutures of 

 the basals — "subradials" — and these plates seem to be minute in 

 most similar Silurian genera. Yet it must not be overlooked that 

 in many cases where the proximal plates are scarcely visible ex- 

 ternally, the}' are quite prominent internall}', often larger than the 

 " subradials." This is especiall}' the case in forms with a concave 

 base. 



In most genera with one ring of plates below the radials, the 

 proximal plates are large and prominent, contrasting in a marked 

 degree with the proximal plates in the two forms last considered. 



There are a few genera, anomalous in structure, which cannot, 

 with our present knowledge of them, be satisfactorily brought 

 within the above comparison — such as Calceocrinus, Catillocri- 

 nus^ Pisocrinus, and perhaps others. 



The Blastoids, with their uniform arrangement of plates, agree 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHTA. 243 



well with Carpenter's interpretation, the three basals being 

 divisible into five plates interradiall}- arranged. 



All these facts seem to indicate that the "subradials," in genera 

 where they exist, are really the basals, and in such simple forms 

 as Cyathocrinus, it seems ver^- reasonable to consider these plates 

 as the horaologues of the genitals, and the radials as the ocular 

 plates in the apical system of the Echini. In more complex forms, 

 such as tlie Actinocrinidae^ Rhodocrinidx^ Ichthyocrinidae.^ etc., 

 there would seem at first to be an objection to this interpretation, 

 arising from the fact that there are several other orders of plates, 

 both radial and interradial, within the body walls, and that in these 

 cases, as in Cynlhoci-inidfe^wc should find the homologues of the 

 apical plates of the Echini in the entire calyx, or the whole series 

 of plates of the aboral side up to the region of the arms, and not in 

 the two rings alone which Carpenter points out as such; in other 

 words, that the apical plates in the Echini cannot be horaologized 

 with some few plates in the calyx, of Palaeocrinoidea. 



In the younger stages of Paleoerinoids. tlie higher series of 

 radials are unconnected b}- interradial or axillary plates, as may 

 be seen most beautifully illustrated in the growth of Sli'otocrinus.^ 



It is also probable that at a still earlier period in the life of 

 these Crinoids, the second and third primary' radials constituted 

 a free ray, as in the more simply constructed Cyathocrinns. In 

 Actinocrinits, etc., the basals, which according to Carpenter are 

 homologous to the '' subradials" in other families, and the genitals 

 in Echini, develop very early in the young, and attain almost their 

 full size when even the first radials are comparative!}' much smaller. 

 "NVe have in our possession a Cyalhocri)iH!<, not more than half an 

 inch in length including the arras and a portion of the column, iu 

 which, while the proximal plates are comparativeh' small, the so- 

 callod "sul)radials" are developed to an extraordinary degree, far 

 more than the radials. The specimen in tliis stage looks remark- 

 ably like Billing's Lower Silurian genus Ilyhocrinus, in which the 

 first interradial ring of plates is enormously prominent and gib- 

 bous, while the proximal ring is apparently wanting, or if it exists, 

 is very minute. 



' See our paper on "Transition forms in Crinoids." Proceed. Acad. Nat. 

 Sci. Philad., 1h78, p. 2:^3, and also pp. 220-"2:}."i for illustrations of develop- 

 ment in the parts in question in successive epochs. 




244 PROCEEDINGS OF TITE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



It is now a very important fact that these two rings of plates — ■ 

 the first radials and the interradial set of i)lates next below them 

 — are the only ones M'hich are found in all Crinoids from the 

 earliest geological ages to the jDresent time. It thus appears that 

 the evidence derived from the embryology of the Pentacrinoid, 

 and the observed mode and order of development in the Paleo- 

 crinoids during individual life, is fully and beautifully confirmed 

 by the geological history of Crinoids. 



All this evidence seems to us to be conclusive, and to prove 

 satisfactorily that the two rings of plates regarded by Carpenter 

 as genitals and oculars, are the fundamental parts in the aboral 

 side of the calcareous skeleton, and that the subsequent orders of 

 radials and interradials are to be considered as supplementary to 

 them, and as the products of growth in the individual and develop- 

 ment in seolooical time. 



Our conclusions being thus in harmony with Prof. Carpenter's 

 views, we think it both logical and expedient to adopt his terms, 

 and call the first ring of plates below the radials " basals" in all 

 cases, and the second ring below, or the proximal plates when 

 there are two rings, " underbasals," thus discontinuing the term 

 " subradials" altogether. 



We cannot, however, agree with Carpenter in supposing, as he 

 does, p. 374, that the underbasals have no representative in the 

 apical S3^stera of other Crinoids or Echinoderms. We incline to 

 the opinion of Agassiz, Loven, and others, tliat they are homolo- 

 gous with the central disc or subanal plate of the Echini, and 

 with the centro-dorsal j)late of Comatula. In the paleozoic genus 

 Agassizocrinus^ which was evidently pedunculate in its earlier 

 stages, but became a freefloater when mature, we find in the proxi- 

 mal ring in young specimens five plates with a central perforation 

 in the disc, and a distinct articulating scar for the attachment of 

 the column. In the free stages, however, every trace of the cen- 

 tral foramen and of the columnar attachment has disappeared, and 

 in most of the specimens not even a vestige of the sutures 

 formerly existing between the plates can be detected. In some 

 they can still be faintly observed, but only near the edges upon 

 which the succeeding plates rest, and not in the median portion of 

 the disc. Another example of this is seen in Edinocrinus (New 

 York Geol, Rep., vol. iii. pp. 119-20) in which the bodies are 

 when young attached to each other or to other solid bodies, and 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 245 



in niatuiit}' become free, and a calcareous deposit is secreted around 

 the base, which covers and oblitei'ates the sutures bet\Yeen the 

 phites. Here again we have an actual metamorphosis — during the 

 life of the individual — of five plates into one, and this seems to us 

 to be strongl}' confirmatory of the views of Agassiz and Lov^n. 

 We are inclined to think that the plute within tlie ring of under- 

 basals when it exists, as in ^lart^upiteH, represents the column 

 of Crinoids generally. 



Having thus discussed the relations and disiinctions between 

 some groups of the Crinoids and the differences between the 

 Paleeocrinoidea and the Stomatocrinoidea — so we should like to 

 call all Crinoids which have an external mouth — we think it pro- 

 per to indicate briefly the principles which we shall endeavor to 

 follow in our more detailed work. 



Classification. 



In attempting to make a systematic classification of the Paleo- 

 crinoids into families and genera, we encounter the difficulties 

 which usually confront us when we undertake to ascertain and 

 define an}' divisions as they exist in nature. We can readily re- 

 cognize in groups of fossils certain broad characters by which it 

 seems natural and satisfactory to bring them together, and we 

 generally find in the characteristic types of the respective groups 

 an association of other characters, b}' whicli the^' appear sharply 

 marked ; and so long as we have to deal with typical forms in 

 isolated specimens or groups, the work is simple enough. But 

 when we begin to investigate large collections, and in a measure 

 to study comparatively all the known material from specimens or 

 descriptions, we find the subject bristling with perplexing ques- 

 tions. Types are found to shade into one another, characters are 

 commingled through processes of transition, which sadly inter- 

 fere with the nice definitions we think we have worked out. How 

 to deal with such forms has alwaj's been a troublesome question 

 with naturalists, and the diverse methods of treating it have given 

 rise to much confusion. We have found it especially perplexing 

 in endeavoring to define the genei-a of the Crinoids. We find for 

 instance, two groups, each embracing a number of species, and we 

 discover general characters which nicely se|)arate tlicm. Further 

 researches presently reveal to us certain forms, including i^erhaps 




246 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



several species, wliich, while agreeing witli one group in most of 

 the characters, persistently differ from it in some one feature, and 

 perhaps in tliis feature the}^ agree with the other group. The' 

 question then arises, what is to be done in cases where there are 

 aberrant forms, departing from one type in the direction of another, 

 and blending the characters of the two? Are we to say that our 

 groupings are worthless, and the two must be thrown into one? 

 This produces confusion, and stands in the wiyy of systematic 

 stud^^; and besides we will then probabl}' be no nearer the truth, 

 for we shall doubtless find a similar relation between the group 

 thus formed and some other, which will demand a similar consoli- 

 dation. On the other hand, shall we stand by the distinctions we 

 have discovered, and range our transitional or aberrant forms into 

 subgroups by themselves, and designate them b}' proper appella- 

 tions? We are clearl}- of the opinion that the latter, judiciously 

 pursued, is the true course, both with regard to convenience of 

 study, and to facilitate the discovery of a natural classification. 

 Without entering into any discussion of the value of these or any 

 other groups as expressions of actual divisions in nature, we pro- 

 pose to adopt this method of treatment, and to recognize sub- 

 genera or subgroups of whatever dignity, as the facts may seem 

 to warrant. In so doing we find it decidedly preferable to give 

 each group a name b}' itself, and consider it as standing alone in 

 its proper rank, and not to name it parenthetically as a mere 

 adjunct to the parent group. If we err on the side of too narrow 

 distinctions, this will only lead to renewed researches and ulti- 

 mately to the truth. 



B}' adopting this course we are also enabled to retain many 

 generic names founded upon good characters as revealed to the 

 authors b}' the material at their command, and thus give to many 

 investigators deserved credit for work which would otherwise have 

 to be wholly ignored. 



We have in some cases found it necessary to revise and recon- 

 struct the genus in ort'ier to bring, if possible, some order out of 

 tlie confusion into which its literature had fallen. In doing this 

 we have endeavored to give ertect to the evident intention of the 

 founder of the genus, and to imi)rove the diagnosis by the aid of 

 more extensive material than he had access to, as well as by the 

 aid of the labors of other investigators. 



It will be well in this connection to point out the structural dis- 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF I'HILADELPHIA . 247 



tinctions wliich we regard as important in the separation of families 

 and genera. On a former page we have alluded to the dome, which 

 we believe affords excellent characters for separation into families. 

 Tiie general plan upon which it is constructed, whether rigid or 

 flexible, composed of movable or immovable plates; with laro-e 

 oral plates, or covered with numerous small pieces; whether pro- 

 vided with a ventral sac; the location of the anus; all of these 

 in our opinion form good family distinctions. Next to the vault 

 must be considered the general construction of the calyx; the 

 elements of wliich it consists; whether it has a subbasal zone; the 

 presence or absence of interradials as a rule; whether the animal 

 was pedunculate or free floating; and last but not least, the struc- 

 ture and position of the respirator}' organs. 



Among the best gene7'ic characters in these Crinoids, we find the 

 following: The general form of the body; the distribution and 

 arrangement of the different plates, lx)th in the vault and in the 

 calyx, particularly the plates of the anal area and their propor- 

 tions ; tlie form and position of the apical dome plates, the posi- 

 tion of the anus and whether consisting of a proboscis or simple 

 opening; the form of the column, the shape and proportional size 

 of its central passage; the construction of the arms and pinnulte. 

 The arms and pinnnlte of the Paheocrinoidea have not received 

 the attention which they deserve, at least not as to their generic 

 importance. A careful study of these organs, as they occur in 

 dilfercnt genera, has convinced us, that not only the arms, but 

 also the pinnuhe, in their variation, in their presence or absence, 

 afford generic characters. Only of late years has attention been 

 drawn to the ambulacral groove of the arm, when it was shown 

 from actual observation that in some genera the furrow is covered 

 by small plates alternately arranged. :Meek and Wortiien describe 

 the arm.'; of Si/inbalhocrinus as being covered by two rows of 

 single plates, arranged in alternation, and a similar structure has 

 been discovered to exist in the arms of Crotalocrinus and Enal- 

 loc7-inus. In Cupre.si<ocrinu.s, according to Schultze, the furrow 

 is l)raced over like a roof. In Cynlhocrinus loivensis, according 

 to Wachsmuth, and ai)par(,'ntly in Gissocrinm^, Angelin, the furrow 

 is covered by two rows of two successive i)lales, the plates of one 

 row alternating with those of the other. In Cyathocrinus longi- 

 mauu.-f, Angl. (lonogr. Crin. PI. 2C, Figs. 4, 5), there are in place 

 of only two, a series of five successive plates from each side, 




248 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



alternately arranged. The plates of each side taper toward the 

 end and infold over the furrow, covering it as perfectly, and in 

 the same manner as in the two former cases. An^elin gives no 

 description, but in his table of contents, he calls the successive 

 plates from each side " pinnulae." 



It is easily seen that the covering to which we refer in the above- 

 mentioned genera, is constructed upon exactly the same principle. 

 It makes but little difference whether there are two single plates 

 or two rows of plates alternating with each other, and it seems 

 evident to us that if in one case they represent pinnulse, we may 

 well consider them to be the same in the other. It is here im- 

 portant to note that in those genera in "which the ambulacral groove 

 is thus covered, no regular pinnules have ever been observed, and 

 moreover the construction is such that no additional pinnulae could 

 have existed; while on the other hand no covering has ever been 

 discovered in forms with true pinnulae. From our observation 

 w^e are of opinion that the pinnulae generally in the Palaeocrinoidea 

 served partly as a cover or protection for the furrow. In a speci- 

 men of Graphiocrinus tortuos/is, Hall, in our collection, the pin- 

 nulae cover the furrow so perfectly that we were for some time led 

 to consider them as a solid integument composed of regular spi- 

 niferous plates. "With a good magnifier, however, we clearh' de- 

 tected the joints of the pinnulae, which are here so placed that 

 the little spines with which their sides are provided stand up erect. 

 In the Actinocrinidse and Flatycrinidae the pinnulae are long, com- 

 paratively slender, and so closely arranged side by side that it 

 appears as if they w^ere connected laterally, which we think is 

 really the case in sOme groups. When the arms are closed, the 

 two series of pinnulae of one arm are laid upon eacii other so 

 neatly, that the arm furrow must have been thereby perfectly shut 

 off from the surrounding water. No additional covering has yet 

 been observed in these genera, and it was evidently unnecessary'. 



All this seems to point to the conclusion that the pinnulfe had 

 the same functions, partly at least, as the alternate plates in Gya- 

 tJwcrinun, etc., and as both have the same position, and evidentlj'- 

 could be opened and closed b}^ the animal, we do not hesitate to 

 consider the latter as the homologue of the former, or in fact as 

 rudiraentar}- pinnulae.

Terminology, etc. 



There is considerable confusion in tlie literature of Crinoids— 

 even among contemporaneous writers— as to the terms employed 

 to designate the different parts of the animal. It is to be regret- 

 ted that there is not some means of establishing uniformity in°this 

 respect, as this would no doubt promote better results in investi- 

 gation. We believe it to be especially desirable, and for the in- 

 terest of science, that there should be a better understanding on 

 this subject between Zoologists and Paleontologists, so that" the 

 same terms may be used, so far as possible, for similar parts in 

 both fossil and living forms. We will not assume to say how this 

 should be brought about, but would be glad to see it undertaken 

 by those of more experience and authority in both fields. 



To avoid misunderstanding of our work we give herewith a list 

 of the principal terms employed, with the definitions as under- 

 stood and used by us. We do not seek so much to introduce new 

 terras as to select the best— in our judgment— of those already 

 known to our branch of science, and then to use them consistently.

Calyx = the dorsal cup, or the test of the ahactinal or dorsal side 

 up to the arms = aboral side. 



Vault, dome, summit = tiie test al)Ove the arms ; the plated cover- 

 ing on the ventral side = oral side = actinal side. 



Ventral sac = vertical extension of the vault in its posterior area, 

 closed at the extremity. 



Anal tube or proboscis =. posterior vertical elongation of the vault, 

 with anal opening at its extremity. The term '^ probo.scis" is 

 so generally used that we feel compelled to retain it, altiiough 

 there is a serious objection to its use. The word implies llmt 

 it is an oral organ used for feeding, which is, bevond the 

 slightest doubt, directly contrary to the fact.

Posterior side = the anal side of the bod}'. 



Anterior side = the side opposite the anal area. 



Eight or left = viewed from the posterior side. 



Bays = the whole collective succession of plates from the first 

 radial up. 



Free rays = radial extensions of the body unconnected by inter- 

 radial plates. 



Arms = radial extensions or branches from the body with a fur- 

 row on the ventral side. 



Pinnules = small, jointed, solid appendages, alternately arranged 

 along the arms. 



Tentacles = soft prehensile organs along the arabulacral furrow 

 of the arms and pinnules. 



Amhulacral furroiv = groove on the ventral side of the arms and 

 pinnules, containing ambulacral canal and food passages. 



Proximal plates = those next to the column. 



Underbasals = the second ring of plates below the radials, here- 

 tofore called " basals" = pelvis of European authors. 



Basals = the first ring of plates below the radials, interradially 

 disposed, equivalent to " subradials" and " parabasals," both 

 of which terms are discontinued by us. 



Radials — all the plates of the bod}' above the basals, radially 

 situated. 



Primary radials = those in the ra3's below the first bifurcation. 



Secondary radials = those between the first and secoud bifurca- 

 tion. 



Tertiary radials = those between the second and third bifurcation 

 (and so on up to the arms). 



Brachials = free radial plates supporting the arras. In our former 

 descriptions we have used the term •' bracliials" for that series 

 of radial plates within the body walls which leads to an arm 

 opening — following Hall and otliers. Finding, however, that 

 this term has been previously applied to the " free radials" b}' 

 Johannes Miiller, and has been adopted by Roemer, Schultze, 

 and the zoologists generally, we propose to discontinue it as 

 applied to the former plates, which hereafter will be desig- 

 nated simply as radials of their respective orders. 



Interradials = plates between the rays and forming a part of the 

 body. 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 251 



Axilla7'y 2:>lates = plates between the divisions of the ra^'s = iu- 

 tersupraradials of Hall and other authors. 



Interhrachials = plates between the arm openings of each ra^'. 

 This term is not strictly correct, when taken in connection 

 with our definition of "brachials," but it has been long used 

 in this sense, and as no confusion is likel}' to arise, we think 

 it best to retain it. 



Anals zz= the series of interradial plates which support the anal 

 opening or tube. 



Apical dome plates = the sj-stem of plates in the vault which oc- 

 cupy a position analogous to that of the apical plates of the 

 calyx. They consist : 1, of a central plate at the apex of the 

 dome; 2, of five large plates (there are generally four large 

 and two small ones, the two latter equivalent to one, being 

 separated by the anal area), arranged around the apex, inter- 

 radiall}' disposed, and corresponding to the first radials ; 3, 

 of five radial dome plates, alternating with the last, and corres- 

 ponding to the first radials. Wachsmuth, Amer. Journ. Sci., 

 Sept. 18TT, p. 187, called the first seven of these plates "api- 

 cal plates." This must be changed to avoid confusion, as the 

 genitals and oculars of Echini are designated b}^ the same 

 term. We now appl}' the term " apical dome plates" to the 

 whole system of principal vault pieces. These plates, which 

 have no representation in the structure of the Stomatocrinoidea 

 nor Echini, exist in a greatly reduced form in the Blastoids, 

 but are specially characteristic of the Actinocrinidae, Plat}'- 

 crinidie, etc. The single plate at the apex we propose to call 

 the central dome jjlates ; the first ring of interradials surround- 

 ing it, the proximal dome platen, and the next ring radially 

 situated, the radial dome plates. 



Oral plates = large interradial plates, covering in form of a jiyra- 

 mid the oral side of the Pentacrinoid larva (Wyville Thomson 

 and Carpenter) = consolidating plates in Cyathorrinus 

 (Waciismuthj = deltoid pieces in Blastoidea. The term "con- 

 solidating plates" is discontinued. 



Ui/drospires = certain organic structures in connection with the 

 inner walls of the test, composed of parallel tubes or folded 

 sacs, probably in connection with the water system. 



Bespiratory pores or orifices = openings through the test, in 

 connection with the liydrospires, ai)parentl3- for the introtluc- 

 tion of water for respiratory purposes.

In the discussion of the different genera we shall give with each 

 a full list of the species which belong to it, in our opinion, inde- 

 pendent of the opinion of others, and this will cause many changes 

 in the reference of species. It cannot be expected that these lists 

 will be free from mistakes, though we have studied each species 

 with great care, the majorit}' of them from the specimens, and be- 

 sides our own extensive collections, one of us had occasion a few 

 years ago to examine the original collections of De Konnick and 

 Schultze, now in theMuseum of Comparative Zoology at Cambridge. 

 Nor can it be expected that in a general work on Crinoids like this, 

 we shall give a full list of synonyms, and we Iiave not attempted 

 to do so. This can onl}' be thoroughly done by the collector who 

 has given his attention for years to the fossils of his own localit}', 

 and is able to identify them from the least fragment. We shall 

 give the s3-non3'ms of the subcarboniferous Crinoids of the Mis- 

 sissippi Valley which we have made our special study, and we 

 hope that investigators will do the same for other localities and 

 formations. We shall feel under special obligations to any of our 

 scientific friends for any information they may be. able to furnish 

 us, either in the way of specimens or observations which may con- 

 tribute to a more thorough understanding and truthful presenta- 

 tion of the subject. We particularl}^ desire this, as we intend to 

 embody the results of all our investigations in this field in a future 

 work to be issued with ample illustrations. 



We take this opportunity to tender our thanks to Prof. A. 

 Agassiz, of Cambridge; Prof. A. H. Worthen, of Illinois; Prof. 

 S. H. Calvin, of Iowa City; Prof. A. G. Wetherby, of Cincinnati; 

 Dr. James Knapp, of Louisville; Dr. Harrod, of Canton; Dr. K.

A SUBORDER OF THE CRINOIDEA. 



BorU', as compared with recent Crinoids, larger; arms shorter; 

 test ctronger. The latter is arranged on various plans, but is 

 always composed of solid plates of which the interradials, in con- 

 trast to the Sfomotocrinoidea, constitute important elements. 

 Plates of the aboral or dorsal side forming a cup, closed on the 

 ventral or oral side bj^ a more or less solid integument, without 

 external food grooves or oral aperture. 



The food conve3'ed through openings at the base of the arms into 

 the body, and carried to the oral centre by means of internal or 

 subtegminal passages. Anus either in form of a plated tube or a 

 simple opening, subcentral or lateral. 



The introduction of water for respirator}' purposes seems to 

 have been effected through small openings or pores wliich penetrate 

 the test. These openings, which in some groups were located in 

 the oral, in others in the aboral regions, seem to have been con- 

 nected with peculiar organs within the bod}', closelj' resembling 

 the so-called hydrospires of Cystideans and Blastoids. 



The Paleocrinoids, with but few exceptions, were pedunculate, 

 attached during lifetime. Flourishing abundantl}- in the Silurian 

 seas, they reach their climax in the Subcarboniferous, as well in 

 variety of form as in number of individunls, and they disa])[)ear 

 almost entirely during the Carboniferous, few forms, if any, sur- 

 viving as late as ^lezozoic times. 



Family I— ICHTHYOCRINIDiE. 



(Diagram PI. lo, Fig. 1.) 



General form of the body including arms, globose to pyriform. 

 Column strong, perforation of medium size, generall}' pentangular. 



Underbasals three, of unequal size; always small, often rudi- 

 mentary and not visible externall}', being liiddeii b}' the column. 

 Basals five, moderately small, sometimes scarcely appearing be- 

 yond tlie column (in Calpiocrinus probal)ly absent or imperfectly 

 developed). Primar}' radials, tiuee to five by five, almost equal 

 in form and size. Radials of each order smaller by half than those 

 of the preceding, and of uniform size. Arms bifurcating, short, 




254 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1879. 



strong, tapering upward, the tips infolding; composed of single 

 joints. Pinnulse unknown. In most of the genera, the arms lie 

 side by side touching laterally, so as to form with the calyx an 

 apparentl}^ compact wall. Radial and arm plates frequently have 

 undulating sutures or additional patelloid plates. The radials up 

 to the second or even the third order form a part of the body, 

 being connected laterally either by a sort of squamous integument, 

 composed of very minute, irregular plates, or by distinct inter- 

 radial and axillary plates, the former varying in number from one 

 to thirty or more, the anal area containing frequently a few addi- 

 tional plates. Anus unknown, except in Tax'oo'inus and Onycho- 

 crinus, which have a small lateral tube. Yentral disc rarely pre- 

 served; composed of a more or less soft or seal}' integument, 

 yielding to motion in the body and arms. 



This family might very appropriatelj'' Be called the Articulates 

 of the Paleozoic Crinoids, being especiall}' distinguished in most 

 of its species by a peculiarity of structure which prevails through- 

 out the rays and arms. The plates have rather shallow excava- 

 tions on their outer upper margins, corresponding to projections 

 on the lower edge of the succeeding plates, which sometimes take 

 the form of superficial patelloid plates, independently articulated, 

 and sometimes anchylosed with the margin of the plate above. 

 This feature produces what seems to be an articulate structure in 

 the whole skeleton, and indicates that the bod}' as well as the arms 

 was somewhat flexible. The interradial areas are sometimes found 

 depressed and in other cases distended, showing that there had 

 been some expansion or contraction of the body walls due to the 

 mobility of the radial parts, and indicating likewise flexibilit}' in 

 the vault. This feature, which is found so far as we know, in no 

 other family, together with the fact that in most of the genera a 

 ventral covering has never been found preserved, leads us to infer 

 that this portion of the body was more or less composed of rather 

 fragile perhaps scaly material, instead of solid plates. If these 

 Crinoids had been provided with a rigid dome, the little projections 

 along the radial and arm plates would have interfered with the 

 spreading of the arms, which is rather facilitated by the mobility 

 of the dorsal side, and the pliant nature of the vault. Such motions 

 would be likewise aided b}' the patelloid plates, which are gener- 

 ally found in large species, and in those in which the interradial 

 spaces are comparativelj^ rigid. 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 255 



In Onychocrinus^ the genus Avhich evidently possessed the 

 greatest expansive power, the radial areas being frequently found 

 spread out horizontal!}', there are toward the inner or ventral side 

 of the raj's rather large plates, to which smaller ones are joined, 

 which connect with the interradial series. They decrease in size 

 and thickness inwardly, and connect with the dome plates. In a 

 specimen of Onychocrinus exscnlptus, Lyon, and another of 0. 

 diversus, Hall, we found the median portion of the vault preserved, 

 the plates being irregularl}- arranged, rather large and thin. This 

 important observation goes far toward proving that the Ichthyo- 

 crinidee had no external oral aperture, for if an}^ of the family 

 were likel}' to have it, it would be Onychocrinus. 



The Ichthyocrinidse are nearest related to the Cyathocrinidse, 

 from which they differ in having several orders of radials included 

 within the body ; in the'articulate structure of the radial portions; 

 in the presence of interradial plates within the regions of the 

 cah'x, and in the pliant vault. 



The separation of the genera in this family has alwa3's been 

 attended with difficulty, and it cannot be denied that several of 

 them shade into one another in a most perplexing manner. They 

 are very closel}' related, and yet there is a habitus, peculiar to 

 t3'pical forms of each genus, which is not easil}' described, but 

 which is readily perceived when large collections are brought 

 together, and which Paleontologists discerned at an early da}'. It 

 is the gradations — the transition forms — which make trouble, and 

 have given rise to continual modifications of the generic formula 

 in hope of reconciling them with new discoveries. While we can- 

 not expect that the divisions we have made are wholly free from 

 errors, yet we find when we arrange the ditferent species according 

 to the generic characters herein given, that the groupings are 

 more nearly conformable to the recognized habitus of the fossils 

 than any we have been able to make heretofore, and we are en- 

 couraged to hope that we may have approximated more closely to 

 the natural divisions. 



The Ichthyocrinidse range from the Lower Silurian to the close 

 of the Subcarboniferous. 



We recognize the following genera : —

A. Typical form. 



General form of body, including arnas, ovoid to pyriform, 

 ■with almost equilateral pentamerous s^^mmetry. Calyx bowl or 

 cup-sbaped. Underbasals three, rudimentar3^, of unequal size, 

 sometimes seen only within the calyx. Basals five, very small, 

 their upper angles acute. Radial plates of adjacent rays alter- 

 nately arranged. Primary radials three to four by five, wide and 

 short, height about equal, but increasing in width rapidl^'^ upward, 

 tbe plates being wider at their upper margins than at the lovs^er. 

 Secondary and tertiary radials similar in form to the primaries, 

 quadrangular in general outline, though really pentangular and 

 hexangular, those of the same order of equal height, and half the 

 Tvidth of those of the next order. Arras twenty to sixty or 

 more, accumbent, infolding at the tips, and forming with the calyx 

 an apparentl}' solid structure. They are composed of single joints 

 which are heav}^, wider than liigh, quadrangular, usually with wav- 

 ing sutures. Arm furrows shallow, tripartite. Pinnulie unknown. 

 Interradial and anal plates generally absent or undeveloped at 

 the outside, 7. nohilis^ Wachs. & Spr. alone, to our knowledge, 

 possessing both ; they are longitudinally arranged, but the anal 

 side cannot be distinguished. Vault unknown. Column com- 

 posed of very short joints near the top, increasing graduall}' in 

 length downwards. Central perforation of medium size, pen- 

 tagonal. 



The most striking feature of this genus, by which it is easily 

 recognized, is its symmetrical, equilateral figure, and this pervades 

 the whole body. 



Hall, in his diagram (Geol. Rep., N. York, vol. ii., pi. 45, fig. 2), 

 figures a small intercalated plate in line with the subradials, which 

 is evidently accidental. He does not mention it in his generic 

 description, nor can we find it in any of our specimens. Angelin 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 257 



mentions a single anal plate, which is not to be found in his 

 figure. The presence of anal, interradial, and even axillary plates 

 in /. nobilis which, as far as known, is the latest representative of 

 the genus, is very instructive, as it shows the approach to 

 Forbesiocri7ius. In j'oung specimens these plates are undeveloped 

 extei'nall}', but are plainh- visible on the inner surface of the calyx. 



Phdlips, in 1836 (Geology of Yorksh., p. 205), described the 

 genus Euryocrinus, which is possibly the same as Ichthyocrinus, 

 and might be entitled to prioritj', but his description and figures 

 are so unintelligible that this would be injustice to Conrad. 

 Phillips' generic description reads as follows: ''Pelvis opening 

 pentagonal, arrangement of plates like Encrinus, internal cavitj^ 

 very large." Not much better are his figures, since the}' induced 

 Bronn to consider Euryocrinus as a synonym of Actinocrinus. 



Geological and Geographical distribution. — Ichthyocrinus is 

 found first in the Upper Silurian, where it is represented in Europe 

 b}' 3 species, in North America b}^ 5. None have been observed 

 in rocks of Devonian age. In the Subcarboniferous 3 species 

 have been discovered in America, none in Europe (unless we 

 count Euryocrinus concavus Phillips). 



We regard the following species as belonging to this genus: —

The Swedish specimens, which b}' Angelin were identified as 

 I. laevis, Conr., are very distinct from the New York species 

 which Conrad described. The European form is pear-shaped in- 

 stead of ovoid, the plates ornamented, but without any surface 

 angularitj', and with nearl}' straiglit sutures; while the New York 

 specimens have plates with smooth but angular surface, and very 

 distinct waving sutures. We therefore suggest their separation, 

 and propose to call the Swedish form /. Gotlandicus.

B. Subgenus HGMALOCEINTIS Angelin. 

 1878. Iconogr. Crinoid., p. 11. 

 We consider Homalocrinus not snfficientl}' distinct from Ichthyo- 

 crinus to rank it as a full genus, but propose the name for a division 

 under Ichthyocrinus. The following is a translation of Angelin's 

 generic description : " Bodj' including arms ovoid. Basals three, 

 small. Parabasals five, triangular, placed between the sides of 

 the primary radials. Primarj'- radials transverse, and in the form 

 of a half moon. Interradials three, the lower one heptagonal and 

 large, with two small ones above. Anals three, subequal. Rays 

 several times dichotomizing." Angelin described Ichthyocrinus 

 without interradials or anals, and it seems that upon this feature 

 mainlj^ he separates ■Homalocrinus. We find, however, in the 

 only known species the anal area slightly different from the inter- 

 radial, and the primary radials, instead of increasing from the 

 base upward, as is the case in all Ichthyocrini, decrease in the 

 same direction, the first radial being here the larger plate. The 

 latter feature has induced us to retain Homalocrinus subgenerically 

 and place it under Ichthyocrinus, with which it has the closest 

 affinities.

The generic description was made from a single specimen, and 

 this was in several respects defective. Cleiocrinus has, according 

 to Billings, five basals alternating with the radials, and forming 

 with them a belt around the column. Such a structure has never 

 been found in any Crinoid. In the tj'pical specimen, the com- 

 paratively large column conceals from view the lower part of the 

 calyx, a space large enough to accommodate one or two series of 

 plates, and analogy suggests that this may have been the case. 

 The five plates which Billings found alternating with the primary 

 radials, and which he called basals, are certainly interradials ; and 

 as the specimen in ever}' visible character closely resembles 

 Ichthyocinnus and allied forms, we have good reason to suppose 

 that it, like those forms, possessed five small basals and three 

 underbasals, both hidden by the column. The latter were prob- 

 ably very minute and rudimentar}', since the specimen is from the 

 Lower Silurian, where it is almost the only representative of the 

 family. This alone induces us to try to define generic characters 

 from a single imperfect specimen. Notwithstanding, therefore, 

 that some of the elements are problematic, we propose until some- 

 thing better is found, the following : — 



Revised generic description. — Calyx obconical or pj-riform, with 

 bilateral symmetr}-. Underbasals probabl}' three, minute or rudi- 

 mentar}'. Basals probably five, very small and hidden b}' the 

 column. Primar}' radials three by five, increasing in width upwards, 

 supporting several superior orders of radials all dichotomizing 

 uniformly, and interlofiking laterally with those of adjoining rays. 

 Interradials, so far as known, one. Anals four to five, longitudi- 

 nally arranged. C. regius has six orders of radials, the number of 

 l^lates doubling with each bifurcation, which gives in the sixth 

 order 64 brachials to each ray or 320 to the individual. Whether 

 the small appendages which are seen at the top of the specimen 

 were arms, cannot be determined from the figure. 



The only known species is:

 iv., p. 53, pi. 5, figs. 1 a-g. Trenton liiuest. Ottawa, Can. 



Billings refers to this genus two other species, C. grandis and 

 C. magniftcus, which he described from mere fragments of the 

 column, l>ut which we cannot recognize. The fragments may be- 

 long to 6'. regius, or to almost any other genus.

3. ANISOCRINUS Angelin 

 1878. Iconogr. CrinoicL, p. 13. 



General form of body, including arms, ellipsoid. Calyx bowl- 

 shaped ; figure bilateral. 



Uuderbasals three, hidden by the column. Basals of medium 

 size, dissimilar in form. Primarj'' radials three to five, the first 

 widest, almost as large as second and third together; the second 

 smallest of all. Secondar^^ radials two, graduall}^ increasing in 

 size upward, the bifurcating plate almost as wide as the third 

 priraar}' radial. Arms apparently free above the secondary radials, 

 accumbent as in Ichthyocrinus^ and composed of transverse joints. 

 Interradials one (sometimes with a small triangular piece above), 

 ver}' large, resting with the lower angle against the short upper 

 lateral sides of the first radials, forming with them a compact wall. 

 Anals two, very large, the upper one the largest plate in the body ; 

 the acute angle of the lower leaning against the basals, with the 

 lower lateral sides resting against the adjoining subradials, and its 

 upper lateral sides against the large first radials. The second 

 anal' plate rests upon the upper truncated side of the lower one, 

 being in line with the interradial plates, and reaches like them up 

 to the top of the secondai-y radials. 



The arrangement and size of the interradial and anal plates are 

 the characteristic features of this genus. Angelin's descriptions 

 are rather indistinct on this point, and in order to have it* properly 

 understood, we give almost a specific description, which will prob- 

 ably' have to be modified when more species are discovered. 

 Onlj' two species are known.

General form of body, with the arms closed, ovoid or pj'riform. 

 Calj'x bowl-shaped, composed apparentl}' of only one ring of plates 

 below the radials; figure bilateral. This ring consists of three 

 plates, one of them small, the two larger ones equal, forming together 

 a pentagonal disc. Primary radials three by five, three times wider 

 than high, differing in size and form ; the first one lunate, the 

 second quadrangular, the third and largest pentagonal. Secondary 

 radials three to four, about equal in size, except those in the 

 posterior rays whose lateral margins retreat to give space for the 

 large anal plates. The upper secondary radials support the arms, 

 some of which bifurcate, while others remain free. Arms similar 

 to those of Ichthyocrinus, their sides closel}' abutting, forming a 

 wall continuous with that of the calyx. Arm joints transverse, 

 quadrangular. Interradials rarely more than one, which is small, 

 wedged in between th'e second and third radials of adjacent ra^'s. 

 Anals three to five, longitudinally arranged, the lower and smallest 

 which is almost triangular resting upon the basal plates, the 

 upper one extending to the top of the secondary radials. Column 

 slender, round, composed of very thin segments ; central perfora- 

 tion small, stellate. 



This genus, as described by Angelin, differs from all the rest of 

 the family in having but one ring of plates below the radials, and 

 this consists of three plates, unequal but apparently so propor- 

 tioned as to be partly radial and partlj^ interradial in position. 

 The various figures, however, disagree in the latter respect. Such 

 a structure would seem to warrant its separation into a distinct 

 famil}'-, but as Calpiocrinus agrees in all other characters with the 

 Ichthyocrinidse, we feel satisfied that it naturall}' belongs here. 

 We are inclined to thinly that in this genus tlie lower ring of plates 

 is the analogue of the underbasals, and tiiat the true basals, if not 

 absent, are exceedingly- rudimentary. We take the small triangu- 

 lar plate which has been called the first anal plate, to be the basal 

 (subradial) on the posterior side which is larger in the wiiole 

 family, and that the plates on the four other sides are very minute 

 or onl}' visible in the inside. 



The presence of but one ring of plates visible below the radials. 




262 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1879. 



the bilateral symmetrj^ of the cal^'x, and the longitudinal arrange- 

 ment of the anal plates, are the most prominent characters of the 

 genus. 



Angelin, on the same page, describes the genus Clidochirus 

 with a single species, which agrees with Calpiocrinus in every 

 respect, except that it has no interradial plates, and four instead 

 of three first radials — variations which may be expected even in 

 the same species.

A. Typical form. 



General form of body and arms subglobose to pyriform. Cal3'x 

 bowl-shaped, unsymmetrical, plates heav}'. 



Underbasals three, unequal in size, larger than generally found 

 in the famil}-. Basals five, three pentagonal or hexagonal, tlie 

 two others having an additional side for the lateral insertion of a 

 small anal plate. Primary radials two or tliree by five, very short 

 and wide, the first one largest. Secondary radials one to three 

 or more, varying in number even in the individual. Arms pre- 

 cisely as in Ichthyocrinus. Inter radials generall}'' absent. Anal 

 plates two, the lower one l3'ing obliquely toward tlie right' side of 



' It is worthy of note that in all Paleocrinoids, so far as observed, in 

 which the anal arrangement is unsymmetrical, the odd plates are pushed 

 out toward the right, never to the left.

the body between the two unequal basals, the adjoining radial, 

 and the other anal plate. The second or upper and larger anal 

 plate is interposed between the primar}' radials and the upper 

 truncated side of the posterior basal. Column round, composed 

 of rather large joints. 



Hall, Schultze, and Angelin mention no interradials in tlieir 

 generic descriptions, but the latter figures a specimen from Got- 

 land, which he refers to L. macropetalus Hall. It has one exceed- 

 ingh' large interradial to each area, which occupies a wide space 

 between the rays, opposite all the primary radials, and as high as 

 the top of the second or third secondary radial. No New York 

 specimen of this species has ever been found with such a plate 

 or even a trace of it, and as the two differ besides decidedly' in the 

 size of the basals, in the form and proportions of the body, and 

 in other characters, we consider the Swedish form even genericall}' 

 distinct. (See Anisocrinus Angelini, W. & Spr.).

 resented in the Upper Silurian bj- 5 species, 4 from America, and 

 1 from Europe. From tlie Devonian but a single species is known,

B. Subgenus PYCNOSACCTISAngelin. 

 1878. Iconogr. Crinoid, p. 13. 



The distinction between PycnoHaccus and Lecanocrinus seems 

 to us scarcely sufficient to warrant a full generic separation. The 

 two agree in all essential features, except that the former, accord- 

 ing to description, has two primary radials instead of three, and 

 that the plates of the calyx are ornamented by radiating ridges, 

 such as are frequently found in Barycriniis. Even in that genus, 

 the ornamentation is not constant, and at the most is a very un- 

 reliable character. In L. Bcemeri Schultze, which has entirel}'' 

 smooth plates, we find in two rays only two primary radials as in 

 Pycnosaccus. It is very significant that if we consider the first 

 and second radials of Lecanocrinus as one plate, we obtain ex- 

 actly the proportions of the first radial in Pycnosaccus, which in 

 our opinion here replaces the first and second radials, while the 

 bifurcating second radial of Pycnosaccus actually represents the 

 third radial of Lecanocrinus. Form of body, arrangement of the 

 anal plates, and construction and folding of the arms precisely as 

 in Lecanocrinus, only that the arm plates are slightly higher.

ond radials wedgcform, shorter, but as wide as the first. The 

 third radials support two arms which bifurcate once. The arms 

 are extremely short, composed of very few joints, tapering rapidly 

 upward, infolding, inclined obliquely from left to right, and when 

 closed they fit so neatly one into the other, that it appears as if 

 they formed togetlier with the calyx a continuous body. Arm 

 joints single, slightly cuneate. Interradials none. Anals one, sub- 

 quadrangular, resting upon the larger basal. Column round, com- 

 posed of thin joints near the Vjody, increasing in length so rapidly 

 towards its base, that in four inches the joints attain a length of 

 half an inch. Central perforation of medium size. 



L. Schultze, in his Monograph der Echinod. Eifl. Kalk., p. 40, 

 pronounces Jlespiloci^inus a synonym of Lecanocrinus. In this 

 he is evidently mistaken. Lecanocrinus has arms like Ichthyo- 

 crinus, while those of Mespilocrinus, in place of being straight, 

 are turned to the right, and the radial and arm plates are conse- 

 quently wedgeform instead of rectangular. Schultze's Lecano- 

 crinus Bcemeri.ow which he based the above conclusion, is a most 

 interesting species to show the relations between the two genera. 

 It occurs in the Devonian and zoologically occupies an intermedi- 

 ate position between the Silurian form Lecanocrinus and 2Iespi- 

 locrinus of the Subcarboniferous. L. Bcemeri not only has very 

 short arms, but they fold up almost as in Mespilocrinus, yet tiiey 

 have rectangular joints and are not deflected. The species has 

 also the unsymmetrical arrangement of the anal area, but the odd 

 plate is here exceedingly small, and has, when combined with the 

 large one, exactly form and proportions of the single anal plate 

 in Jlespilocrinus, thus approaching and foreshadowing the bilateral 

 form which succeeded in the Subcarboniferous. 



Mespilocrinus seems to be strictly a subcarboniferous genus, 

 and onl^- four species are known : —

According to Phillips (Morris's Catal. Brit. Foss ), Taxocrinus 

 has "5 basals; 3 radial plates in 5 series ; arms dividing upon the 

 third radial and frequently dichotomizing above this point; arms 

 and branches of single series of joints, interbrachial and axillarj' 

 plates." 



This description embraces almost every genus of the Ichthyo- 

 crinidse^ among them Forhesiocrinus. 



Johannes Miiller, Monatsbericht der Berliner Akademie, March, 

 1858, was the first who mentioned the presence in Taxocrinus of 

 three small, pieces within the parabasalia — basals, — similar to 

 those found by Hall in Ichthyocrinus^ and in species which were 

 supposed to be Forhesiocrinus. Miiller's discovery was evidently 

 overlooked b}'' Hall, who in 1858 described his Taxocrinus inter- 

 sca7Jr/Zar?s with five basals and no subradials; and in 1861, and 

 even later, he refers several species with three basals and five sub- 

 radials to Forhesiocrinus^ which undoubtedly belong to Taxocri- 

 nus. Schultze, in his description of Phillips genus (Monogr. p. 32) 

 calls the small plates " cryptobasalia," because they are always 

 hidden by the column, and sometimes only visible within the 

 calyx. 



The tripartite proximal ring, rudimentary in some instances, is 

 now admitted to belong to all tlie genera which we include among 

 the Ichth yocrinidse, and it therefore no longer forms a geueric 

 distinction. 



The separation of Taxocrinus and Forhesiocrinus has always 

 been a stumbling block to Paleontologists. De Ivoninck and 

 Lehon gave as the principal distinction, that Taxocriyms had no 




18T9.J NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 2^7 



anal nor interradial plates, while Forbesiocrinus had both, and 

 sometimes a large number of them. 



In 1806, both Meek & TTorthen and Schnltze wrote on this 

 sulyject, and arrived independently at the same conclusion. The 

 former, in an elaborate article in the Illinois Geological Report, 

 vol. ii. p. 270, show that the same species may have sometimes no 

 interradials, and again from one to three. The}' refer to Taxo- 

 crinus Hall's Forbesiocrinus Thiemei, whicli was described as 

 having no interradials, but which has sometimes two. and which 

 we have even found with as raan\- as five regular interradial plates. 

 The one, according to De Koninck, would be Taxocrinus, the 

 other Forbesiocrinus. To amend the generic formula so as to 

 admit species with one or two series of interradials, did not seem 

 to those authors expedient, since the species exhibit such a wide 

 range of variation in this character. Xor do they consider the 

 presence of axillar}- plates which occur in both groups, nor the 

 small patelliform supplementar}- pieces of some well-defined species 

 of Forbesiocrinus a means of distinction, inasmuch as tliey are not 

 alwa^-s present in otherwise tj-pical forms of that group ; while 

 well-marked species of Taxocrinus are described as showing the 

 patelloid plates between the arm joints. Meek and AVorthen 

 therefore concluded, until more distinctive characters should l)e 

 discovered, to place Forbesiocrinus — embracing species with many 

 interradial and anal plates — as a mere section under Taxocrinus. 



Schultze found in his Devonian species almost every cliaracter 

 of Forbesiocrinus except the small patelloid plates, but whetlier 

 these were sufficient to distinguish it from Taxocrinus^ he did not 

 wish to decide, and so he placed the species from the Eifel. in 

 which these plates do not occur, under Taxocrinus. He, how- 

 ever, included with this genus species which evidentl}' belong to 

 very distinct genera. 



Angelin, in the Iconographia Crinoideorum Sueciae, pp. 8, 9, 

 gives generic descriptions both of Taxocrinus and Forbesiocrinus, 

 and ranges under tlie two genera several new species. His d'> 

 scriptions onl}- differ, so far as we understand them, in this : that 

 in Forbesiocrinus the number of primarj' radials is left an open 

 question, while in Taxocrinus the number is fixed at 3 X 5 ; that 

 the former had one large hexagonal anal plate (lie evidently 

 meant, to judge from his figures, "and other smaller ones succeed- 

 ing"), and a considerable number of interradials. the lower one 




268 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [18T9. 



much the largest; while Taxocrinus has two series of anals and 

 several interradials. The three underbasals are comparatively 

 large in both groups. Angelin's descriptions of both genera are 

 short, and give us but little additional information regarding their 

 relations; on the contrary they rather increase the difficulty, as 

 none of his species of Taxocrinus or ForbesiocriJius are true rep- 

 resentatives of either, thus raising the question whether the Swe- 

 dish species ought not to be considered as types of new genera, 

 or at least be separated subgenericalh^ We prefer the latter 

 course, and propose Gnorimocrinua for the former, and Lithocri- 

 7ms for the latter. 



Phillips in proposing the genus Taxocrinus included in it the 

 following species, in the order in which we give them, viz., Poterio- 

 crinus Egertoni Phill. 2. Gyathocrinus tuberculatus Miller.^ 

 3. Cyafhocrinus maci'odactylus ; and 4. Gyathocrinus nohilis 

 Piiill. The first of these, a subcarboniferous species, with no or 

 but few interradials, must be considered, according to the most 

 generally accepted rules of naturalists, the type of the genus. The 

 second and third species have but one or two interradials, T. tuber- 

 culatus, according to Pictet's figure, one or two anals resting on 

 the upper truncated side of the large basal. The fourth species 

 was Koninck & Lehon's tj'pe of their genus Forbesiocrinns. 



Now comparing the anal arrangement of the latter — or rather 

 of ForbesiocrinusAgassizi'S.ti\\,^'\nc[\ undoubtedly belongs to the 

 same group, and in which these parts are better known-^— we find 

 the large basal not truncated, and the anal series which rests di- 

 rectly upon it almost identical in construction with the interra- 

 dial series, except that it is slightly broader, and that it consists 

 of a few more plates. We also find in that species a considerable 

 number of axillary pieces, which extend up to the top of the ter- 

 tiary radials where the arms become free. 



Referring to Taxocrinus^ or to species with but few interradials, 



' Roemer, 'considering Miller's genus Cyatliocrinus not distinct from 

 Poteriocrinus, proposed in 1851 (Foss. Fauna d. DeYon. Gebirges a. Rhein, 

 p. 8), and again iu 1855 (Letlia?a Geognostica, Ausgabe III. p. 238), that 

 all species hitherto placed under Phillips' Taxocrinus^ be arranged under 

 Gyathocrinus with G. tuberculatus — Miller's second species — as type, and 

 the generic formula amended accordingly. The genus Gyathocrinus, how- 

 ever, with Miller's first specios (7, planus as type, has been accepted by 

 almost every other paleontologist. 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 269 



we find the first anal either directly' upon the truncated basal as in 

 Taxocrinus tuberculat'us, or sometimes, in species in which the 

 first radials join lateral!}-, the first anal is placed opposite the 

 second and third or even between the third radials, as in Taxocri- 

 nus Thiemei^ but in either case, with the exception of the Swedish 

 specimens, the anal plate has a truncated upper side, and is suc- 

 ceeded by from two to six similar, narrow, quadrangular plates, 

 longitudinally arranged. The plates diminish in size upwards, 

 and form the dorsal side of a short and slender lateral proboscis, 

 whose ventral parts, as well as the wall supporting them, have 

 never been found preserved, and evidently consisted of more fra- 

 gile material. 



Returning to the interradial series we find specimens with appa- 

 rently none to three or more interradial plates, with variation 

 even in the individual, and some with as many as nine interradi- 

 als, though in no instance extending up higher than to the top of 

 the third primary radials, above which the rays are almost always 

 free in the fossil. This, however, was not the case in the animal. 

 Schultze found in his T. juglandiformis^ within the open spaces 

 between the ra^^s, as well as between the first divisions of the raj'S, 

 a large number of very minute, uneven and twisted pieces, which 

 evidentl}^ took the place of the larger interradial plates in all 

 cases where those did not exist. Similar pieces were figured by 

 Angelin in the Swedish species, and they probabl}' were present 

 in all Taxocrini. 



In some well-preserved specimens of Taxocr. (Forbesiocr.) 

 multibrachiatus Lyon & Cass, from Crawfordsville, Indiana, and 

 in a Taxocrinus ramulosus, Hall, from Burlington, Iowa, we have 

 had an opportunity to examine this structure. Both species have 

 a comparatively large number of interradials, the former from 

 three to nine, arranged in from two to four series, the other six 

 to seven in three series. These plates are quite prominent and 

 differ but slightly in size. The little jjlates in question, or the 

 plated integument as we should rather call it — the plates seem to 

 be imbricated — is attached to the upper series of interradials, and 

 fills the rather large interradial space up to the top of the second- 

 ar}' radials, inclosing the axillary spaces between the series of the 

 latter up to the first arm-joints, and evidently covering the 

 entire oral side of the body. On looking at the anterior side of 

 these specimens, the construction seems almost identical with 




270 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1819. 



that of Forbesiocrmus, except that the upper part of the interra- 

 dial area is less substantial and compact ; hut their posterior 

 aspect exliibits in Taxocrinus a small lateral proboscis, while in 

 Forhetiiocrinus tlie space is filled witli heavy plates, in the latter 

 an almost pentamerous symmetry, in Taxocrinus (except in the 

 Swedish species), a distinct bilateral one. This we consider the 

 best distinction between the two genera. (Compare Diagram, 

 PI. 15, Fig. 2.) 



An examination of a very large series of well-preserved speci- 

 mens of the two genera has led us to this conclusion, and to a 

 modification, to this extent, of the opinion intimated by us here- 

 tofore (Proceed. Phila. Acad. Nat. Sci., 1878, p. 254), that there 

 is no distinction between these genera. We find that in practice 

 we can separate them quite satisfactorily by the characters herein 

 indicated, and, accordingly, we propose the following revised 

 generic diagnosis : — 



A. Typieal form. 



Bod}', including arras, rather short, depressed ; cal3'x cup- or 

 bowl-shaped, with bilateral symmetr}'. Underbasals three, some- 

 times ver}' small, unequal in size, the two larger ones pentangular, 

 the smaller quadrangular. Basals five, four of them equal and 

 with acute upper angles, the fifth larger, generally with truncated 

 upper sides. Primar}- radials three — rarelj' four — by five, of nearly 

 equal size, wider than high, quadrangular in outline, except the 

 upper one which is pentangular. Secondary radials varjMng in 

 number from three to six — the former most prevalent — slightly 

 smaller than the primar}' radials, and resembling them in general 

 form. Tertiar}' radials like the preceding, only comparatively 

 smaller and supporting the arms. 



Arms dichotomizing once or twice, composed of single, short 

 joints, more or less rounded on the back ; sutures frequently 

 sinuate, and sometimes provided with supplementary' patelloid 

 plates. Interradials none to three or more — as man}' as nine have 

 been observed — extending as high as the top of- the second or 

 third primary radials, with very minute, irregular plates above, 

 which fill the entire space to the top of the secondary radials, the 

 axillary spaces, sometimes enclosing the first arm plates, and 

 probably covering the entire ventral side of the body. 



Some species have from one to three regular axillary plates, 

 with occasionally a single plate in the axil between the tertiary 




1879.J NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 2T1 



radials. Anal plates resting upon the truncated upper side of the 

 larger basal, or sometimes placed independently in line witli second 

 and third radials. The}' consist of a series of from two to five 

 narrow quadrangular plates, longitudinally arranged, the upper 

 ones formiuii the dorsal side of a small lateral proboscis. Column 

 comparatively large, rapidly tapering, composed near the body of 

 thin joints, which gradua]l3' increase in thickness as they diminish 

 in diameter. Central perforation of medium size, pentangular as 

 far as observed. 



Geological and Geographical Distribution. — Taxocriniis, so far 

 as known, appears first in Europe, where it is represented in the 

 Upper Silurian by 2 species, in the Devonian by 3, and in the 

 Subcarboniferous by 2. In the United States and Canada (if we 

 exclude Lecanocr.(J) elegans, from the Trenton group), it is first 

 found in the Devonian, from which 4 species are known, and fr(jm 

 the Subcarboniferous 13 are described. 



We include in the typical form of the genus the following spe- 

 cies: —

111 form and general habitus closely resembling Taxocrinus. 

 Arms comparatively longer, figure irregular, lacking the bilateral 

 symmetry of that genus. The basal (subradial) on the posterior 

 side is exceedingly large, reaching almost up to the top of the ad- 

 joining first radials. The first anal plate, instead of resting upon the 

 truncated upper side of that basal, leans ngainst the oblique right 

 side and the adjoining first radial. A second series of anals. gener- 

 ally composed of two plates, rests above the basal and first anal 

 plate. All succeeding pieces are small, frequently, but not alwa3's, 

 quadrangular, and form as in Taxocrinus a short and narrow 

 lateral proboscis which, however, is here pushed over toward the 

 right side of the body, thereby destroying the symmetry which is 

 characteristic of that genus. Arms placed apart, outer face 

 rounded, bifurcating unequally bj- throwing off branches toward 

 the inner side of the ray, the outer side forming almost a straight 

 line. Column composed of long and short and wide and narrow- 

 joints which alternate from the top, not exclusively short joints at 

 the top as in most Taxocrini. 



We place here the following species : —

A. Typical form. 



Comparatively larger tlian any oLlier genus of the Ichthyocrinidse. 

 Body, including arui.s, broad,, short, almost equilaterally penta- 

 merous. Calyx very large, plates heavy and nodose, radial por- 

 tions prominent. Underbasals three, small, hidden b^' the column, 

 two of them of equal size, the third smaller. Basals five, four 

 about equal, the one at the posterior side larger, rarelj'- truncated. 

 Primary radials three to four by five, generally four, but varying 

 in number in the individual; large, almost equal in size and form. 

 Secondary radials two, three, four, or more to the series, about 

 half as large as the primary radials, and of the same general form. 

 Tertiary radials smaller than those of the preceding order and 

 comparatively shorter, the rays becoming free at the second, third, 

 or fourth plate. Arms long, dichotomizing, infolding at the tips 

 so that their full length is seldom observed. They are composed 

 of single, short plates, slightly rounded at the back, with a deep 

 ventral furrow. Arm joints in corresponding subdivisions of the 

 same size, those in each succeeding order smaller by about one- 

 half. The sutures of the radial and arm plates strongly sinuate, 

 and partly occupied bj- additional patelloid plates. Interradial 

 area extending to the top of the tertiary radials, and composed of 

 a large number of plates, from ten to twenty or more, which de- 




18T9.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 215 



crease in size gradually upward, the lower one being about half 

 the size of the primary radials. 



Axillary plates from ten to twenty and more, with occasionally 

 one to three within the axil of the tertiary radials. Anal area 

 without lateral proboscis or visible aperture, slightly wider than 

 the intcrradial areas and similarly arranged, with generally two 

 plates in the first series instead of one. Dome unknown, but 

 evidently to some extent flexile. Column large, tapering down- 

 ward, with very thin joints next the body; central perforation of 

 medium size, pentagonal. 



The most important distinction between Forbesiocrinus and 

 Taxoc7'hius is to be found in the construction of the anal and 

 interradial areas. Unfortunately the type specimen of the former 

 genus is in these particular parts very imperfect. We therefore 

 proi)ose, until better specimens of Forbesiocr in in; nobilis De Kon. 

 & Leh. are discovered, to make Forbesiocrinus Agassizi Hall the 

 type of the genus. This large and beautiful species from the 

 Burlington limestone evidently belongs to the same group, and 

 has been found in excellent preservation. 



Geographical and Geological Distribution. — Forbesiocrinus is 

 not distinguished for a great variety of form, nor for abundance 

 of individuals. In Europe, there has been found only one species 

 from the Mountain limestone of England In the United States, 

 it is represented by four species, all from the Subcarboniferous. 



^Ye recognize the following species as belonging to this genus:

B. Subgenus LITHOCRINUS Wachs. & Spr. 

 (xt&oc, a stone ; xj^rvr, a lily.) 



Prof Angelin, in the Iconogr. Crinoid. Suec, p. 9, has described 

 several Gotland species under Forbesiocrinus, which we propose 




276 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



to separate subgenerically. Tliey differ from all subcarboniferoiis 

 species of this group in having larger underbasals, fewer plates in 

 the interradial and anal areas; in exhil)iting a strong tendency to 

 a bilateral figure instead of a pentahedral; in having comparatively 

 much larger and higher first, and shorter second and third radials; 

 also in the exceedingly large first interradial and first anal plate. 

 Arras, so far as ol)served, free al)Ove the secondary radials, but 

 only toward the inner side of the ray; the outer side forming 

 almost a straight line. No pinnulfe ol)served. Column round, 

 composed of alternately larger and smaller joints not tapering 

 in diameter downward. 



This division embraces the following species: —

Body extended in five free rays, which are sometimes spread 

 out horizontally ; arms resembling ^the talons of a fowl. Cal3'x 

 depressed saucer or Ipw cup-shaped. 



Underbasals three, of unequal size, rarely seen beyond the 

 column. Basals five, four with obtuse angles, the fifth with a 

 truncated or slightly excavated upper side. Radials four to five 

 (rarely six to seven) by five; comparative!}' large, almost of equal 

 size. At the third, fourth, or fifth plate, the raj's become free, 

 after which they divide once, each division giving off the true 

 arms. Arms very short, branching once or twice, disposed in 

 clusters at the extremities, and in some species along their sides 

 also ; composed of single joints with waving sutures and deep 

 ventral furrow. In the anal area there is a series of from three to 

 five very narrow, quadrangular plates, which rests upon the trun- 

 cated or slightly excavated upper side of the basal, and forms a 

 small lateral proboscis as in Taxocrinus. Interradials three to 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 277 



twenty, perhaps more in some species; the first one large, resting 

 between tlie first and second radials; the succeeding ones smaller, 

 rapidlv det-reasing in size and thickness upward, and having an 

 inward curvature. The}- are foHowed by very minute, irregular 

 polygonal plates, which form the interradial portion of the vault. 

 The radial summit areas consist of two rows of somewhat larger 

 plates, alternately arranged, which extend to the ventral covering 

 of the free rays, and probably throughout their full length. In 

 the median portion of the vault, there are six rather thin but large 

 apical dome plates. The summit, when the rays are extenrled, is 

 not higher than the top of the second radials; general surface de- 

 pressed. Column heavy, composed of very thin joints, tapering 

 rapidly downward; central perforation above medium size, pen- 

 tagonal. 



Oiiychocrinvs is most nearly related to Taxocrinus, with which 

 it is almost identical in the construction of the anal portions. It 

 diflFers, however, materially in the free rays, the arm structure, and 

 its greater expansive power. 



L3'on and Casseday took the free rays to be arms, and the true 

 arras to be piniiul?e. These authors did not extend the genus to 

 forms like their Forbesiocr. ramulosui^, which has only four radials 

 instead of five, as stated in their generic formula, tiiough that 

 species has all the otlier characters of the genus. 



Hall has never recognized Omjchocrinus as a genus, but placed 

 0. asteriaeformis, a t3'[)ical form, under Foy-besiocn'nus. Meek 

 and Worthen. evidently considering the small lateral proboscis 

 the principal distinction l)etween Oni/chocrinus and Forbesiorri- 

 nua, and not knowing that all Taxocrini have it, placed all species 

 of this group in which the}' observed this appendage under Ony- 

 chocrinus.

 been found only in the Subcarboniferous of Ireland and the United 

 States; it embraces the following species: —

This genus was originally referred I)}' its author to the Cyntho- 

 crinidse^ with which, indeed, it agrees in some of its peculiarities, 

 but a full understanding of the true nature of its structure shows 

 that it must be classified with the [chthyocrinidse. The numlier 

 of plates which constitute the proximal ring was not then, nor is 

 now, ascertained with certainty, owing to tlie fact that they ex- 

 tend l)ut slightl}' beyond the column, and, though we are inclined 

 to think there are but three, we cannot as 3'et assert it positively. 

 The first radials in some points resemble those of Cyathocrinus^ 

 being exceptionally large for the Ichthyocrinidse. They have above 

 a deep rounded sinus for the reception of the second radials, on each 

 side of which, the upper margin of the plate is near!}- straight and 

 not incurved. The latter pecidiarity, whicli was noticed in the 

 original description, suggests the i)resence of an interradial struc- 

 ture, and the continuance of the bod}' between the so-called free 

 radials, otherwise this part would have to be more inflected for 

 the support of the dome. That an interradial structure existed 

 in the genus, is plainly seen in a specimen of N. Warhsmulhi M. 

 and W., now before us, frosn which we infer that the interradials 

 extend most probably even to the succeeding order. This struc- 

 ture alone would be sufficient to place Nipte7'oc7'inus among the 

 Ichthyocrinidse^ but it has also the peculiar lunulate second ra- 

 dials, the waving sutures, and strongly- marked sinuosities of the 

 arm plates, and apparentl}' no proboscis, not even a vestige of

that organ having l)een discovered, though we had occasion to 

 examine on this point some remarkably perfect specimens. 



Beiu's'^d Generic Diarfnoi.i.—Body, with arms inclnded. short; 

 the five rays equilateral ; arms divergent. Plates of calvx un- 

 usually thin, and. as far as the top of the first railials, forming a 

 basin or depressed cup composed of immovable plates. Succeed- 

 ing plates, though connected laterally, movable, 



Underbasals small, scarcely extending beyond the column. 

 Basals much smaller tlian the first radials, all pentangular and 

 of equal size, lladials three to four by five. First radials com- 

 paratively much larger tlian in any other genus of this family; 

 articulating face concave, and occupying less than one-half the 

 width of the plate; the upper margins on both sides of the scar 

 nearly straight, almost horizontal, scarcely inflected, and support- 

 ing the interradial portions which are rarely preserved, leaving 

 in tlieir place, in the fossil, a wide, open space between the rays. 

 Second and third radials short, often three or four times wider 

 than high, lunulate, resting in the concavity of the preceding 

 plate; the bifurcating plate almost triangular. Succeeding order 

 of plates constructed like those of the arm, only larger, all of 

 them much wider than high, rounded on the back, with distinct 

 waving sutures showing deep sinuosities when the arms are 

 closed, and indicating a great mobility in these parts. Arms 

 divergent, tapering gradually; pinnulic unknown. No interra- 

 dials to the top of the first ra<lials, l.nt the succeeding ra.lials, and 

 probal)Iy the first plate of the next order, connected by an inter- 

 radial integument, the true nature of which has not been fully 

 ascertained, being proliabiy similar to that in Taxocrinus, but 

 composed of larger plates. Column round, thick, composed near 

 the calyx of narrow joints.

Schultze, in his Monogr. d. Eclunod. d. Eifl. Kalkes, p. 39, de- 

 scribes a form under tlie name of Taxocrinus gracilis, which is 

 very interesting, inasmuch as it combines, to some extent, the 

 characters of several families. There are only five arms, which 

 remain simple throughout their entire length, forming a straight 

 line with the radials — a peculiarity found in no other genus of the 

 Ichthyocri"idse. This attracted the attention of Schultze, who 

 suggested either a modification of the genus Taxocrinus, so as to 

 admit this species, or the recognition of a new genus. In the 

 former proposition We cannot concur, as it seems to us we must 

 admit such peculiarities as exist in this species to be generic dis- 

 tinctions, or throw all forms of the Ichthyocrinidse into a single 

 genus. As to this genus, we even entertain some doubts whether 

 it belongs to the same family. 



Our genus Rhopalocrinus, with R. ( Taxocr.) gracilis Schultze, 

 as type, agrees in general form rather with Cupressocrinus, Sijm- 

 bathocrinus and Graphiocrinus — representing as many distinct 

 families — than with Taxocrinus; but it differs from all of them in 

 having a series of small plates inclosed between the rays. These 

 plates, which Schultze calls " interbrachials," fill up, according to 

 his descrii)tion, "tlie intermediate spaces to the top of the second 

 radials," being thus included within tlie body. If we were sui'e 

 that this was the case, w^e should, notwithstanding the simple 

 arm structure, i)lace Rhopalocrinus, without hesitation, under the 

 Ichthyocriindee; but-, as it is, the preservation of these parts is 

 not so satisfactory as to exclude another interpretation. The so- 

 called intcrl)rachial plates are seen only in one interradial space, 

 and, as all successive plates from the radials to the tips of the arms 

 have the same form (with the exception of the first one, which is 

 thi'ee to four times shorter, but otherwise similar), and an almost 

 circular articulating surface, which has never been observed in 

 plates forming part of the body, it seems quite possible that all 

 branches were free, and that the small plates were deposited 

 accidentally, being either plates of the vault, or perhaps remains 

 of the pieces which once covered the arm furrows.^ This of

course would remove Bhnpalocriniis from the Tchthyocrinidse^ 

 and bring it in close relation with such genera as Symbalhocrinus 

 and Pixocrinus, with wliich it agrees in its arm structure and in 

 the narrow proboscis, which probubl}' extended in those genera to 

 the extremities of the arms. 



We propose the following generic diagnosis: General form of 

 bod}', including arms, subclavate. with bilateral S3'mmetry ; plates 

 heavy. Underbasals three, scarcely visible beyond the column. 

 Basals five, four of them equal, regularl}' pentangular, tlie fifth 

 much higher, becoming narrower toward the top, truncatetl above 

 for the accommodation of the proboscis. Radials placed in a 

 direct line with the arms ; one ring only constituting a part of the 

 solid body, all succeeding ones be'ng more or less movable. First 

 radial large, heavy, the articulating face occupying almost the 

 entire width of the plate, circular, facing sliglitly outward, and 

 perforated with an opening which communicates with the inte- 

 rior body and with a passage toward the dorsal side of the arms. 

 Second radials, or first brachial plates, wide but short, evidentl}'' 

 movable, probablj' connected interradiall}- (between the rays) by 

 small polygonal plates. Succeeding plates all of the same width 

 and form as those of the preceding ring; their hcigiit, however, 

 three or four times greater. Arms five, simple throughout, and 

 closely' resembling those of Symbalhocrinus ; length unknown, of 

 almost uniform size up to the sixth plate. Ambulacral furrow 

 covered by two rows of plates roofed together, with the median 

 line elevated. Anal area supporting a lateral proboscis similar 

 to that of Onychocrinus, but heavier, and prolialily extending up 

 to the top of the arms, as in Symbalhocrinus. Interradial sitaces 

 apparently filled b}' very small, uneven polygonal plates up to the 

 second brachial. Column large, almost cylindrical, and composed 

 of larger and smaller joints near the body. 



The only known species is —

Family II.— CYATHOCRINIDiE. 



The Cyathocrinidae represent not only one of the largest but 

 also o«e of the earliest groups of the Palseocrinoidea, and they 

 survived every other family of that sub-order. 



J. S. Miller, the author of Poteriocrinus and Cyathocrinus, the 

 two principal genera, placed the former among the Semiarticulata 

 and the latter under the Tnarticulata, which he understood to re- 

 present two distinct families. Poteriocrinus, according to his 

 views, had the plates of the calyx articulating imperfectlj' with 

 each other, while the plates of Cyathocrinus were closel}' joined 

 b}' sutures lined with muscular integument. It is unnecessary to 

 examine Miller's divisions in detail, as they are based upon theory 

 and incorrect observation, as is further shown b}' the fact that un- 

 der the Inarticulata he united Cyathocrinus with Actinocrinus^ 

 Rhodocrinus and Platycrinus, which are of course totally dis- 

 tinct. 



Thom. Austin's classification (1843, Rec. and Foss. Criu.) is 

 equally unsatisfactory. He followed Miller in separating Cyatho- 

 crinus and Poteriocr.inus into two distinct families, placing the 

 former among the Platycriuidae, and including therein Caryocri- 

 nus ; and Poteriocrinus with Symbathocrinus among the Poterio- 

 crinidse. The former group is based simply upon the presence of 

 but few plates in the cal3'X. In the Poteriocrinidae, according to 

 Austin, "the lower series of plates surrounding the body, rest on 

 and articulate on the superior columnar joint, which also articu- 

 lates by radiating strios to the concealed dorso-central (basal) 

 plate." By the " concealed dorso-central plate" Austin meant a 

 little tripartite plate, which he and Pliillips supposed the}' had 

 discovered in Poteriocrinus within the ring of the underbasals, 

 but which has been seen b}' nobody else, and in fact does not 

 exist. The radiating striae, however, are found between the cal^-x 

 and column, and all along the latter between the joints in all pe- 

 dunculate Crinoids. His disposition of Cyathocrinus is no 

 better, as he arranges it in the same famil}- with Caryocrinus, 

 which is a Cystidean. With our present knowledge it is evident 

 that Austin's divisions are wholly arbitrary, and not according 

 to nature. 



The next attempt at classification was made by Prof. Roemer 




18T0.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 283 



(1855, Lethaea Geognostica, Ausgabe III., Period I.), who went 

 to the opposite extreme b}' uniting Miller's t3'pical species of 

 Cyathocrinus with Poferiocriniis, and placing the latter with 

 Woodonrinus, Homocritius, Dendrocrinus, Mespil^crinua, and 

 Thysanocrinus under the Poteriocrinidfe. It has been explained 

 elsewhere that Roemer adopted the generic name Cyathocrinus 

 with Miller's Cyathocrinus tuberculafus as type for another group 

 of Crinoids, which had been previously separated by Phillips 

 under Taxocrinus, and ranged these with Ichthyocrinus and a 

 number of other genera under the family name " Cyathocrinidae." 

 It will thus be understood that Roemer's Cyathocrinidae really 

 represent our Iclith3-ocrinidfe, and his Poteriocrinidae our Cyatho- 

 crinidfe. He united in the former an assemblage of verj^ distinct 

 groups, and among his Poteriocrinidae are found Meapilocrinus^ 

 which, as we believe, belongs to the Ichthyocrinidae, and Thysa- 

 nocrinus, which is distinct from any of these families. 



Angelin, in his systematic arrangement of the Gotland Crinoids 

 (Iconogr. Crin. Suec), very correctly places Sicyocrinui-, Eus- 

 pirocrinus, Ophiocrinus, and Botryocrinus among the Cyathocri- 

 uidae ; but Gissocrinus, which closely agrees with Cyathocrinus^ 

 except in having three underbasals instead of five, he classes (ap- 

 parently on account of this structure alone) with the Forbesio- 

 crinidae. We have already, in our introductory remarks, noted 

 the difficulty of classifying the genera according to the number 

 of proximal plates, and in Gissocrinus we have a good example 

 of this, 



A close and comparative stud}- of the genera Cyathocrinus and 

 Poteriocrinus has convinced us that, though the two are very dis- 

 tinct genericall}', they are, as between themselves and in connec- 

 tion with man}' other genera, united by very important structural 

 features, and by right ougiit to be regarded as of one family. 

 Tiiey all agree — 



1. In having large oral plates supporting the ambulacral grooves 

 and covering the ventral disc, but leaving an opening at the oral 

 centre, which is perfectly covered by the apical dome plates. 

 Food grooves along the vault closed by two rows of alternating 

 pieces. 



2. In the presence of a porous ventral snc, located posteriorly, 

 and closed at the top, in which tlie anal functions were subordi- 

 nate to other offices, probably in connection with respiration and 




284 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [18*19. 



perhaps reproduction. Aual opening rarely observed, evidently 

 lateral — not posterior — and low down. 



3. In having the calyx constructed of onh' three rings of plates 

 alternating with each other. Proximal or underbasal plates some- 

 times imperfectly developed or even wanting ; the plates of this 

 order rarely ancliylosed. No interradials, but anal plates gener- 

 ally found within the calyx. 



These are the dominant characters upon which we propose to 

 establish the CyathoCrinidse as a family. 



An attempt to subdivide this family by means of differences in 

 the construction of the anal area and presence or absence of pin- 

 nule into two groups, represented by Poteriocrinus and Cyatho- 

 crinus^ proved unsuccessful. It is true the two typical genera 

 are well distinguished by these characters, and most genera from 

 the Carboniferous might readil}' be separated in tliis waj' ; but it 

 would be very difficult with the Silurian genera, in which the 

 anal area is imperfectly developed. Such a division might pos- 

 sibly be established if we had before us the living types instead 

 of fossils, and it is very likely that the earlier forms, which include 

 Heterocrinus, locrinus, Dendrocrinus, Carabocrinus, Hyhocri- 

 nus, and Anomalocrinus, in which the proximal plates or under- 

 basals are as yet very small and scarcely visible, might also be 

 arranged in a division by themselves. So, too, Woodocrinus^ 

 Zeacrinus^ Hydreionocrinus^ and Gceliocrinus are well charac- 

 terized by their enormous balloon-shaped ventral sac; and in like 

 manner Eupachycrinus, Erisocrinus^ and Stemmatocrinus, by the 

 dwarfing of the same organ to its minimum size, represent a 

 transition in the direction of the Encrinidae. All these groups 

 apparently have some claim to be classed independentl}", but in 

 doing so we should rather increase than diminish the difficulties 

 before us, and gain nothing in the end. The genera are so closely 

 linked together, and shade so easily from one to another, and 

 from one group into another, that a satisfactory separation is 

 next to impossil)le. But, in order to facilitate the comparative 

 study of the genera, we have arranged them systematically in 

 such a manner that allied types are brought together in the order 

 in which they pass into one another, and we are confident that 

 this arrangement will materially assist in the recognition of the 

 genera.

' Since Tvriting our classification, Prof. Zittel of Munich, with whom we

We doubt whether this division can be maintained practically. Iletero- 

 crinus is certainly more closely related to Hybocrinus, which he disposes 

 under a separate famil}', than to Graphiocrinus, Philoeritius, Erisocriniis, 

 and Stemmaiocrinus with which he groups it. The variety of Poteriocrinus^ 

 ■which we have proposed to call Scytalocrimis, has such close affinities to 

 Gruphiocrinus that it might well be doubted whether it would be considered 

 as a subgenus of Poteriocrinus or Graphiocrinus. If a division of the Cya- 

 thocrinidaj should prove desirable, it would seem to us more natural to bring 

 iogeWitr Heterocrinus with Ilybocrinus and Anomalocrinus, &nd to place 

 Gruphiocrinus and allied genera under the Poteriocriuidae ; but this would 

 interfere with the division according to pinnulje. The difficulties in the 

 way of a subdivision, which we have discussed at length in our general 

 remarks on the family, do not seem to us to be obviated by the proposed 

 arrangement of our distinguished colaborer.

In some species of Heterccrinus^ one of the oldest of known 

 genera, the underbasals or proximal plates are apparently want- 

 ing; in others they are so imperfectly developed that Meek did 

 not think proper to recognize them by the usual term, but called 

 them sub-basals. If it happens that these plates are absent, as 

 seems to be soraetimes the case, in species which apparently belong 

 to the same genus, it would seem impi'oper to separate Hetero- 

 crinus on that ground alone, and this consideration has induced 

 us also to place in this famil}^, at least for the present, the allied 

 genera Hybocrinus and Anomalocrinus, in which as yet no trace 

 of these plates has been discovered, but which otherwise have all 

 tlie characters of the typical Cyathocrinidoe. The famil}'^ re- 

 lations as to these genera are not altogether clear, and it will re- 

 quire further study and better material before we can expect to 

 understand them fully. For the present we will content ourselves 

 with drawing attention to some peculiarities in the structure of 

 these early Crinoids in hope that it may lead eventually to in- 

 teresting results. 



We find that in Poteriocrinus^ Zeacrinus, and in fact in all t3'pi- 

 cal Cyathocrinidae in which columnar or radicular cj-rrhi have 

 been observed, these appendages are radiallj' situated. This is 

 best obsei-ved and traced in species with a pentagonal stem, 

 wherein the direction can be noted even in fragmentary pieces. 

 The cirrhi here occur alwaj'S along the lateral faces, and in the 

 last-named genera, so far as observed, they are always radial, 

 while the acute angles which are formed into elevated ridges along 

 the column are interradial. The ver}' opposite is the case in 

 Heterocrinus and locrinus^ in which the cirrhi are interradial, and 

 the ridges of the column radial, exactl}' as in Belemnocrinus, and 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 287 



apparently in tlie Actinocrinidaj and PlaM'crinidae. This might 

 have induced us to place Heterocrinus and locrinus in a separate 

 division along with Hyhocrinus and Anomalocrinus, wiiich latter 

 two'evidentl}' belong to the same group, if we had not discovered 

 that the same diversity of structure apparently exists in species 

 of another family. In all Pentacrini, recent or fossil, that have 

 come under our observation, the cirrhi are radial and the ridges 

 interradial, with the exception of Pentacrinus Johnsoni^ in which 

 according to Austin's figure (Rec. and Foss. Grin., PI. 15, Fig. i.) 

 the cirrhi are situated interradially as in locrinus. Owing to 

 this interesting coincidence, and also to the fact. that in Dendro- 

 crvius, wliich in man}' respects closel}^ resembles Heterocrinus 

 and its above-named associates, this columnar structure is the 

 same as in all typical genera, we have retained these genera 

 for the present in this family. We also retain those genera in 

 which the five underbasals are metamorphosed into tliree, as in 

 GissociHnus, contrarj^ to Angelin and Zittel, or into a single plate, 

 as in Slemmalocrinus, provided they otherwise agree with the 

 family'. 



In the C^'athocrinidoe, the anal area, though constructed of com- 

 paratively few plates, affords most excellent generic distinctions in 

 their arrangement. We note two principal forms; the one, which 

 we may call the Poleriocrinus form — as it is best illustrated in 

 that genus — is generally composed of three plates in the cal3'x, 

 which are arranged unsymmetricall}' and alwa^'s directed toward 

 the right side of the body; the other, or Cyathocrinus anal 

 arrangement, with a bilateral symmetry, consists of a single plate, 

 which rests upon the truncate posterior basal. The former occurs 

 in connection with regular piunulae along the arms; in the latter 

 the arm furrows are covered b}- small alternate pieces and the 

 pinnulae are wanting. 



There is scarcely any difficulty in referring all C3-athocrinidae, 

 from the Upper Silurian to the close of the Carboniferous, to one 

 of those two groups, though the anal plates vary in form more or 

 less in every genus. In genera from the Lower Silurian this 

 is more diflicult. Yet there appears to exist even among the 

 latter and in connection with all others, an easy gradation which 

 indicates tliat both forms had ver}- probablj' the same origin, and 

 that the later ones were gradually' developed from the earlier 

 Silurian types. 




288 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



Looking first at the subgenus locrinuf^, one of the earliest 

 known forms of Crinoicis, we find the body up to the top of tiie 

 radials perfectly equilateral, all basal and radial plates having the 

 same form ; but higher up this symmetry becomes disturbed by 

 irregularities in the disposition of the brachial plates. There are 

 four brachials in four of the rays, short and all quadrangular, 

 while the right posterior radial supports a peculiar bifurcating 

 plate of the same width as the other brachials and apparently 

 similarly articulated. Its right sloijing side supports four bra- 

 chials, its left a number of large, heav}^ almost quadrangular 

 plates, longitudinally arranged, rounded on the back, which have 

 the general appearance of arm plates, and such the}' have been 

 taken to be by most authors. They are, however, plates of a 

 rather strong ventral sac, and extend to its full length forming a 

 highl}^ elevated ridge (PI. 16, Fig. 3). The plates are bordered on 

 each side b}' about double their number of rather delicate pieces, 

 altogether different and transversely arranged, which from their 

 peculiar elongate form and relative position resemble pinnule be- 

 longing to an appendage that looks like an arm. Now the ques- 

 tion arises, what shall we call the bifurcating plate which gives 

 rise both to the right posterior ray and to the ventral tube? It 

 was certainl}^ a movable plate, and as we mentioned before, its 

 mode of articulation was evidently the same as that of the bra- 

 chials. Shall it likewise be called a brachial? And again, was not 

 the ventral tube here, and in Criuoids generally, originally a 

 modified arm? This, if true, would at once explain why the anal 

 area leans alwaj-s toward the right and never to the left side of 

 the body. Is the plate, on tlie contrary, an anal plate? If so, the 

 arms in that ray would rest ui)on the base of the proboscis, which 

 is not very probable. That it is a brachial with interradial func- 

 tions, is illustrated in other genera. In Dndrocrnjius, as may 

 be seen, PI. 16, Fig. 5, the case is substantially the same, but in 

 that genus a regular anal plate has already appeared within the 

 calyx, supporting the ventral sac. Here four of the radials are 

 equal instead of four brachials, and the fifth is a compound plate 

 consisting of two successive plates of about the form of the simple 

 ones, but slightly larger. Nobody can doubt that here both the 

 upper and lower sections of the compound plate, which are sepa- 

 rated by a horizontal suture, are strictly radial. Looking, however, 

 at Homocrinus, PI. 16, Fig. 6, it will be found, although, it differs 




18T9.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 289 



from Dendroc7'inus only in having the suture between the sections 

 of the compound plate sloping instead of horizontal, that by this 

 in itself trifling alteration, which required no modification in the 

 form or construction of other plates, the lower portion of the 

 original compound radial became transformed into an an:d plate. 

 This was the first step towards a Poterocrinus anal arrangement, 

 and in fact to complete it required onlj- the interposition of a 

 third small plate (PI. 10, Fig. T). In confirmation of this idea it is 

 very significant that Dendrocrinus is essentially a Lower Silurian 

 genus, that Homocrinu)> is restricted to the Niagara group, and 

 Poleriocrinus is pre-eminently a subcarboniferous form. 

 ■ The step from Dendrocrinus to Cuathocrinus (PI. 16, Fig. 8) 

 was equally simple, and required only tlie consolidation of the 

 compound plate into one, the simple anal plate being already 

 developed in the former. Sometimes, howeveu, in genera wherein 

 otherwise the Cyathocrinus anal arrangement prevails, there is 

 found alongside of the single anal plate in some species — occa- 

 sionally only in a few specimens, and in Bari/crinus and Botryo- 

 crinus almost as a rule — a supplementary anal piece obliquely in- 

 terposed toward the right side, standing as a witness to the com- 

 mon origin of this and all anal plates. That there has never been 

 observed a ^ingle instance in which the anal area was directed 

 toward the left — not even an abnormal case — is most significant, 

 and is strong evidence in favor of our opinion, that the ventral 

 sac originated in the right posterior ra}'. It proves also that the 

 modifications which we have mentioned as taking place in the 

 family in geological succession, are occasionally found within the 

 limits of a genus. 



It is to be regretted that the ventral sac, owing to its position, 

 hidden between the arms, is so rarely observed. A better know- 

 ledge of this organ, we have no doubt, would enable us to base 

 upon it excellent generic distinctions, and it might perhaps assist 

 in establisiiing subdivisions in this family. Very little is known, 

 for instance, of the distribution and position of tlie pores and 

 fissures, of the anal opening, etc., and nothing as to its internal 

 organization. 



In the Lower Silurian the ventral sr.c attained large dimensions. 



In the age of the Niagara group, Upper Silurian, it became re- 



> markable for its singular form, in some genera coiling upon itself, 



or bendiui' in all directions. In the Devonian and earlier Subcar- 




290 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



boniferous it attained the maximum in lengtli, and the cj'lindrical 

 form prevails, but tliis by degrees changed into the club-shaped 

 form, from which in the succeeding geological epochs, toward the 

 close of the Subcarboniferous, those monstrous balloon-shaped 

 sacs were developed, and with these, as if a culmination had been 

 reached, the family actually terminates. The few forms which 

 still survive can no longer be considered as true t3'pe8 of the 

 Cyathocrinidae. They are of a type prophetic of a new family 

 which is soon to appear, and of which Enc7'inus is the leading 

 genus. The resemblance of Stemmatocrinus to Encrinus is in- 

 deed so strong that one may well hesitate in which of the two 

 families — Cj'athocrinidae or Encrinidoe — it should be classed. 

 We should probably have decided in favor of the latter, if we had 

 seen any possibility of separating Stemmatocrinus from Etqja- 

 chycrinus, and Eupachycrinus from Foteriocrinus, and so on. 

 . The only real difference which we notice between the two is that 

 in Encrinus the three rings of plates which form the calj-^x, in the 

 Cyathocrinidae constitute an almost flat disc, or so shallow a cup 

 that there would be no space for a visceral cavity if covered by 

 solid plates, and, as no trace of a ventral covering has ever been 

 observed-, it is xcvy probable that Encrinus belongs to the Stoma- 

 tocriuoidea. 



The free floating Agassizocrinus {Astylocrinus Roemer) is an- 

 other form, in regard to which doubts might be entertained 

 whether it ought not to be ranked with the Cyathocrinidae. Its 

 younger stage, wherein it was pedunculate, agrees well in general 

 structure with Eupachycrinus, and is very appropriate!}" called 

 the Cyathocrinoid form. "We think it better, however, to separate 

 the genus by itself, as in the case of Pentacrinus and Comatula, 

 and to place it under Astytocrinidse in a distinct group. 



General Family Diagnosis. — Calyx composed of only three 

 rings of plates alternating with each othei*, each ring composed 

 of five plates ; all succeeding plates free. The proximal ring or 

 uuderbasals not unfrequentl}- hidden from view by the column, 

 perhaps in some cases wanting, rarely anchylosed so as to form 

 three plates or a single one. The plates of the second ring gener- 

 ally varying in form, the posterior one frequently truncate. Those 

 of the third ring or the radials, more or less pentagonal, the right 

 posterior one often smaller on account of interposed anal plates. 

 The succeeding order of plates which have been generally desig- ^ 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 291 



nated as " free radials," but for wliicli we have adopted the term 

 " brachials," consists of one to two or more by five plates on which 

 the arms originate. 



Arms simple or branching, comparativel}' long; either provided 

 with rather strong pinnUlffi, alternatelj^ arranged, or, in the ab- 

 sence of these, the ambulacral groove is covered with two rows 

 of alternating pieces, more or less wedge-shaped, sometimes 

 strongl}' cuneiform, and interlocking. 



There are from one to four anal plates within the calyx. Wlien 

 there is a single anal, the symmetry of the body is generally bila- 

 teral, but, in case of two or more, tlie form is irregular, because 

 the plates tend obliquely toward the right side of the body. The 

 anal plates support a ventral sac, which is cylindrical, convoluted, 

 club- or balloon-shaped, and which occasionally attains immense 

 proportions. The sac is bordered with rows of pores or fissures; 

 its upper extremity closed, so far as observed ; the anal opening 

 lateral. Interradial plates proper entirely wanting. 



Calyx surmounted by five large oral plates, with a central 

 opening between them, and forming at their sutures five shallow 

 ambulacral grooves converging toward the centre. Central open- 

 ing covered by the apical dome i)lates, and the five grooves arched 

 over by two rows of small immovable pieces, altcrnate'y arranged. 



Column round or pentagonal.

The genus Heterocrinus varies from the typical Cj'athocrinidje 

 in several important particulars : first, in the apparent absence of 

 underbasals in some of the species ; second, in certain irregulari- 

 ties in the radial plates. In the former respect it agrees with 

 Hi/bocrinus and Aiwmalocrinus, in the latter with Dendrocrinus. 



The irregularities in the radial parts seem at first sight to be

totally at variance with tlie elementary plan of structure in the 

 family, as the calyx here appears to be composed of more than five 

 radial plates, some of the raj'S having apparently two or even more. 

 Looking at Diagram PI. 16, Fig. 2, showing the arrangement of 

 plates in H. simplex Hall, it will be fuund that in the anterior 

 and right posterior rays, there are three plates in succession, 

 whereas there are four in each of the other rays. But it will be 

 also observed that the first radial plate in the former is about 

 equal in size to the first two plates combined in tlie three other 

 rays. It is, therefore, not unreasonable to suppose that the two 

 here represent a compound plate, and are homologous with the 

 single radial in other Cyathocrinidse. This interpretation fully 

 restores the famil}' relations, the two succeeding plates being con- 

 sidered as true brachials. A similar construction exists in Den- 

 drocriniis, but there only the left posterior radial is compound. 



The absence of underbasals in some of the species is a good 

 illustration of our view that the under!)asals do not constitute 

 principal elements in the structure of the Palneocrinoidea, but 

 are merel}' the result of growth and development in geological 

 time. Even Meek, who calls the proximal plates in all other 

 genera of the Cyathocrinidse basals, substitutes for those of 

 Heierocrinus the name "subbasals." 



Generic Diagnosis. — General form elongate and slender. Calyx 

 small, subcylindrical, tapering but slightly from the column 

 upward. 



Underbasals minute, in some species almost undeveloped, and 

 appearing externally as subtrigonal points at the lower ends of 

 the sutures between" the basals; in some species apparently 

 wanting entirel3\ Basals five, subequal, pentangular. Radials 

 irregular; some of the raj's differing from those of other genera 

 in having compound instead of simple plates, which are divided 

 by horizontal sutures; upper articulating margin straigiit. The 

 radials are succeeded by two to four brachials, quadrangular, the 

 upper one a bifurcating plate and supporting the arms. 



Arms comparatively long, simple or branching, composed of 

 single joints with almost parallel suture. Pinnulre heavy, springing 

 alternately from ever^- second or third arm plate. 



Anals not supported by the basals, but resting upon the upper 

 sloping margins of the adjoining radials. The}' consist of a single 

 row of plates, longitudinally arranged, the outer side rounded

and forming a prominent ridge, which gives tlie appearance of an 

 arm. 



The ventral sac in tliis genus is but imperfectl\' known, but it. 

 is api)arently not so robust as in locrinus. Column more or less 

 pentagonal. 



The genus Heterocrinus is known exclusively from the Lower 

 Silurian, and has been found onl}' in America, unless Miiflodacty- 

 lus (?) heterocrinus Angl., from the Upper Silurian, belongs to it. 



The following species have been discovered : —

for a subgenus. It seems that he was in doubt whether locrinus 

 should be placed with Eeterocrinus or Poteriocrinus. as he sup- 

 posed those two genera to be closely related. In this Hall is cer- 

 tainly in error, since a close comparison proves them to be very 

 distinct. Neither can we conceive how such forms as locrinus 

 crassus can be referred to Heterocrinus. The two differ essen- 

 tially in the anal arrangement, and in tlie form and construction 

 of the radial plates, which are perfectly symmetrical and simple 

 in the former, but irregular and compound in the latter. Sut-h 

 characters have heretofore always been considered of generic im- 

 portance, and we accordingly adopt Prof. Hall's name but in a full 

 generic sense, and propose for the genus locrinus the following: — 



Generic Diagnosis. — General appearance somewhat similar to 

 Pentacrinus; comparatively larger than Heterocrinus; arms 

 longer and more frequently bifurcating; calyx more broadly 

 spreading, and perfectly sj^mraetrical up to the top of the radials, 

 giving the form of a short, inverted, pentagonal pyramid with 

 the five sides deeply concave. 



Underbasals undeveloped. Basals small, pentagonal. Radials 

 comparatively large, strong, all pentagonal, and of the same 

 height; their upper margins truncated for nearly their entire 

 breadth for the junction of the succeeding pieces. Brachials 

 three to four in each ra}', the upper one axillary, and supporting 

 the first free divisions of the arms. In the right posterior ray 

 there is interposed between the true brachials and radial plate a 

 pentagonal bifurcating piece, which is evidently free and mova- 

 ble like the brachials, and of the same width. This peculiar plate, 

 which is truly radial, supports on its right sloping side the usual 

 number of brachials, and on the left a row of quadrangular plates, 

 verticall}' arranged, extending to the tips of the arms, and form- 

 ing the posterior wall of a large ventral tube. In external ap- 

 pearance these plates resemble the brachials and arm plates, only 

 they are somewhat higher and not quite as wide; they are gib- 

 bous, and form an elevated ridge, which causes this appendage to 

 resemble an arm or a branch of the ray, and so it was considered 

 by Hall in his description of Heterocr. polyxo. Both sides of the 

 mesial ridge are indented to accommodate other plates, of which 

 there are two to each median plate, one abutting against the mid- 

 dle part, and the other opposite the suture. These lateral plates 

 are delicate, three or four times wider than high, and, like the other, 




18T0.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 295 



longitudinally arranged. Each of them contains a rather deep 

 furrow, which in perfect specimens is arched over by a row of 

 wedge-shaped plates which stand out prominently and appear very 

 much like pinnnlte.' 



Arms bifurcating frequently, gradually tapering; arm pieces, 

 like the free radials, all projecting at the upper edge, thereby pro- 

 ducing a sort of imbrication. Piunuia? unknown. 



Column strong, distinctly' pentagonal, the angles in line with 

 the radial plates of the bod\'. 



Geological position. — Lower Silurian. 



The following two species are the onh' examples of this genus: —

Generic Diagnosis. — General form of the crinoid depressed, 

 calyx comparatively large, depressed snbglobose ; its form ex- 

 tremely irregular, scarcely two plates being of the same shape. 



Underbasals unknown, and perhaps undeveloped. Basals five, 

 small, subequal, pentagonal, wider than high,partl3' hidden b}- the 

 column. I'ndials very large, of diverse forms, simple or compound, 

 the latter divided either horizontally or vertically. Of the com- 



' It was to this peculiar structure that avp alluded in our remarks on this 

 family, and the similarity in the appearance of the ventral sac and the arms 

 and pinnul.T is indeed most striking. If there is in nature anv surh thing 

 as a transmutation of one organ into another, it would seem that such was 

 the case here, and this may lead to a better understanding of the functions 

 of the ventral sac. 




296 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



pound plates, those that are divided by horizontal sutures, occur 

 in similar rays as in Heterocrinus, being always found in the right 

 posterior and either in the left lateral, or in the anterior ray. The 

 radials of the remaining ra3's are eitlier simple or bisected verti- 

 calh', the two halves taken together being similar in form to the 

 simple plates. The lower segment of the former compound plates 

 is subquadrangular, the upper one axillarj^ and pentagonal, its 

 lower edge slightl}' concave to fit the convexity of the abutting 

 margin below. The raj-s with simple radials have generally fewer 

 brachials than those with compound plates, and this gives to the 

 Crinoid that abnormal, irregulnr appearance which is the most 

 characteristic feature of the genus. 



Arms divergent at their origin ; long, slender, bifurcating irregu- 

 larl}' several times above, the divisions being often of unequal 

 size; rounded, and composed each of a single range of pieces. 

 Pinnulffi strong. First anal plate resling transversely* between 

 the upper sloping sides of the posterior radials ; succeeding plates 

 smaller and longitudinally arranged. 



Column stout, round, composed of very thin discs or segments, 

 and having near the base a large pentagonal opening. The seg- 

 ments have the appearance of being composed of numerous little 

 anchylosed spicula of irregular size and form (Meek). 



Anomalocrinus has its closest affinities with Heterocriniis, to 

 which it was referred in 1865 by Meek and Worthen as a subgenus. 

 Not so apparent are its relations to Hyhocrinus, with which the 

 same authors afterwards similar!}'- combined it. It certainly dif- 

 fers from them both very distinctl}' in the shallow and depressed 

 form of the body, in the form and arrangement of the radial 

 plates, and in the arms. 



Geological poi<itiou. — Lower Silurian, so far as known. 



Two species have been described : —

Calyx globular or pyriforra, one side protuberant ; composed 

 of 5 basals, 5 radials, and 2 anal plates. 



Underbasals not observed, and probably rudimentary. Basals 

 of equal size, pentagonal. The next ring of plates consists of a 

 large anal and four of the radials, all nearly equal in size, and 

 alternating regularly with the basals. The anal plate is hexa- 

 gonal, its two upper sides equal, the sloping right side supporting 

 a small radial, the left a second anal plate. Both of these plates 

 are wider than high, of about the same size, which is about one- 

 third that of the plates below. They are separated by a vertical 

 suture, and rest by their outer edges against the upper portion of 

 the adjoining radials which are octagonal, while the other two are 

 heptagonal. 



Arms five, simple througliout, composed of rather heaw quad- 

 rangular joints, about as wide as high, decreasing in size slightly 

 upward. Pinnulne wanting. The ambulacral furrow is covered 

 by small alternating pieces, about five to each arm-joint. 



Column round, small. 



The unsymmetrical form of the calyx, produced by the protu- 

 berance of the posterior side ; the peculiar position and small size 

 of tiie right posterior radial, and the large anal plate in line witii 

 the four larger radials, are the most remarkable features of tiiis 

 ' genus, and those by which it is easily recognized. The small 

 radial evidently corresponds to the upper half of the compound 

 plate in Dendrocrinus, while the lower half, which is here appar- 

 ently absent, is perhaps represented in a portion of the large un- 

 divided anal plate.

 America.

A. Typical form. 



General form of the crinoid elongate and slender. Calyx ob- 

 conical, higher than wide, unsymmetrical. 



TJnderbasals five, similar in form, scarcely of medium size, but 

 extending beyond the column. Basals five, the largest plates in 

 the calyx; four of them equal, hexagonal, the fifth or posterior 

 one heptagonal, truncate above for the support of a large anal 

 plate. Radials alternating with the b.asals all around, simple in 

 four of the rays, pentagonal and of about equal size. The right 

 posterior radial is compound, divided by a horizontal suture into 

 two halves, which, taken together, have about the form of the 

 simple plates, only slightly longer. Brachials two to five, some 

 long and narrow, and others short and wide. Anals one, sub- 

 quadrangular. 



Arms long, branching; ambulacral furrow deep. Pinnulne 

 ■wanting. 



Dome unknown. .Yentral sac strongly- developed, comj)osed of 

 numerous small, hexagonal, alternatel}'^ interlocking plates of 

 equal size, strengthened by little transverse or slightl}' oblique 

 costiB, and so arranged as to present an ascending zigzag appear- 

 ance. 



Column pentagonal, or excei)tionall3' round. 



The compound plate in the right posterior ray is one of the best 

 characters of Denrfrocrtnus, and distinguishes it readily from Gya- 

 thocrinus with which it is most likely to be confounded. The 

 lower half of the radial has nearly' the same position and form as 

 the first oblique anal plate in Foleriocrinus,aiu\ both these plates 

 rest against the sloping side of the posterior basal, with an anal 

 plate on the left; but while this plate in Dencfrocr^inus is succeeded

suture (which becomes oblique in Homocrinus)^ in Poteriocrinus 

 it supports a third anal plate, and b}' pushing the right radial to 

 one side assumes its oblique position which it maintains through- 

 out all genera of tlie Poleriocrinus group; while in the C'yatho- 

 crinus group the compound radial becomes modified into a single 

 plate.

1852. Geol. Rep. N. Y., toI. ii. p. 185. 



Thefollowing is Hall's generic description of Homocrinus : " Crin- 

 oidea having the calyces composed of three series of simple plates, 

 each series consisting of five plates, sometimes one or more irreg- 

 ular plates intercalated between the scapular or third series of 

 plates on one side ; arms proceeding from the summit of the third 

 series of plates, without tentacles." And he says further: "The 

 Crinoids constituting this genus have been referred to Poteriocri- 

 nus and Cyathocrinus, the structure of which genera are some- 

 what different. The two species given as Poteriocrinus in vol. i., 

 Palgeontolog)^ of New York, should be placed under this genus, 

 having the same simple structure and arrangement of plates, 

 arms, etc." 



The above description is so indefinite, that it includes almost 

 every genus of the Cyathocrinidae ; the only character mentioned 

 of generic value is the absence of pinnulae, in which it agrees, how- 

 ever, with Gyathocrinus and Dendi^ocrinus. The tj'pical speci- 

 mens which Hall used for description were most unsatisfactory, 

 that of H. parvus being evidently a very 3'oung individual, while 

 those of H. cylindricus are very iraperfectl}- preserved. In Hall's 

 corrected list of the New York fossils he seems to have given up 

 both Dendrocrinus and Homocrinus^ as he groups the species of 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PIIILADELPIIIA. 301 



both under Poteriocrinus. In 18G1, however, he described two 

 new species under Homocrinus, from good specimens. The}- are 

 not Poteriocrinus^ for they have no pinnulje, nor Cyathocrinus, 

 for they have an extra intercalated plate above the basals ; nor 

 Dendrocrinus for that plate is not radial ; but their affinities are 

 the closest with the latter, with which they agree in all principal char- 

 acters. We therefore regard Homocrinus as a subgenus under 

 Dendrocrinus^ and propose the following description, with Homo- 

 crinus scoparius Hall as type: — 



General form and arrangement of plates like in the typical 

 Dendrocrinus, except at the posterior side where the lower por- 

 tion of the compound plate is pushed slightly to the rear, thereby 

 becoming a regular anal plate or support for the ventral sac. 

 Hence in Homocrinus only the upper portion of the compound 

 plate is a radial, and there are two anal plates, one subquad- 

 rangular, between the posterior radials, and supported on the 

 truncated basal; and a smaller one resting obliquely between two 

 basals, the right radial and the other anal plate. 



The underbasals are perhaps proportional!}- larger than in Den- 

 droci'inus. The arms have no pinnulae, and this, together with the 

 different arrangement of the anal plates forms the best distinction 

 from Poteriocrinus. The ventral sac is without mesial ridge or 

 lateral costse. Column, so far as observed, round. 



Geological position, etc. — Upper Silurian in America. In 

 Europe it has been found in the Devonian. 



Six species are known : —

In the Thesaurus Devonieo-Carboniferns, Dr. Bigsby calls Cya- 

 thocrinus very appropriately " a genus full of errors." This un- 

 fortunate condition is iargel}'^ clue to the confusion existing among 

 Miller's tyi^ical species, which embrace an assemblage of very dis- 

 tinct t^'pes. It seems even doubtful whether an}' of his species 

 can be properly ranked within the genus, and this would naturally 

 suggest the question whether Cyathocynnus, as Roemer has sug- 

 gested, ought not to be given up altogether. "We are of opinion, 

 however, that the genus ought to stand, and that it can be so 

 amended as to include certain forms of Crinoids which liave been 

 referred to it by later palaeontologists, and which cannot be in- 

 cluded in any other established genus. 



Miller describes the genus substantially as follows: "Column 

 round or pentangular; calj'x composed of a saucer-shaped pelvis 

 consisting of five plates, on which are in successive series five costal 

 plates, five scapulae, and one intervening plate, with an arm pro- 

 ceeding from each scapula having two hands and several fingers." 

 A comparison will show that this description differs from Pote- 

 riocrinus in but a single point, viz., Cyatliocrinus has but one 

 intervening or anal plate, Polerioci'inus two or more. 



Miller refers to Gyathocrinus the following four species: 1. G. 

 j^lanus, which ought to be the type of the genus. 2. G. tiibercu- 

 latus, which has since been referred to Taxocrinus. 3. G. I'ugosus 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 303 



which Goldfuss made the type of Crotalocrinus. 4. C. quinquan- 

 gularis^ which has been conceded to be a Poleriocrinus. As a 

 proof how indefinite was Miller's conception of the genus, it may 

 be noted that three of the four species are of distinct families, 

 while he himself places Poteriocrinus among the Semiarticulata, 

 and Cyathocrinus among the Inarticulata. 



C planus is, therefore, the onlj'^ species that need be considered 

 with reference to Cyathocrinits. The ''pelvis" has the t^-pical 

 saucer shape, with a subpentangular perforation. There are five 

 " costals," four of them hexagonal, the fifth with a truncated supe- 

 rior margin ; " scapulae" of similar form to those in Poteriocrinus^ 

 having also a horseshoe-like impression, with a transverse perfo- 

 rated ridge for the reception of the first arm joint (brachial), and 

 which is succeeded b^- a cuneiform bifurcating plate. The arms 

 (or hands of Miller) bifurcate several times, and there are six 

 fingers to each division of the ray, which are all tentaculated on 

 alternate sides. Here again is mentioned a single (anal) plate 

 interpose<I between the radials or " scapulae," and this plate is 

 placed upon the truncate costal (basal). The description applies 

 well gencrically to a large number of species which have been re- 

 ferred to Cyathocrinus^ differing, however, in the pinnulate (ten- 

 taculated) arms. Not one of those specius has ever been found 

 with pinnulfB, though we have examined with reference to this 

 point a large number of species, and some most perfect specimens, 

 in which the covering of the ambulacral furrow is beautifully ex- 

 posed all along the arm, and in which it seems certain that if they 

 had been provided with pinnulae, these organs would have been 

 preserved, A similar covering has been found, with slight modi- 

 fication, in three or four other genera of the Cyathocrinidas, but 

 never in species with pinnulae, and this suggests the idea that 

 they may not exist in those genera. We therefore consider the 

 presence or absence of pinnuLne of generic importance, and do not 

 iiesitate to say that if Miller's Cyathocrinus planus had pinnulae, 

 it cannot be classified with species in which these organs are 

 wanting; and we also feel assured, from analogy, that if this was 

 the case in C. jylanus, it will be found to possess more than one 

 anal plate in the calyx, and prove to be a true Poteriocrinus. 



Miller figures three specimens of this species. Fig. 1 repre- 

 sents an entire specimen, with a piece of column and perfect 

 arms; the arms branch off" from the second brachial, and are 




304 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



long, composed of wedge-form plates, which give off on alternate 

 sides a row of strong pinnulae, such as are found in Poteriocrinus. 

 The specimen shows one side and parth^ the anterior of the body, 

 for the ray at the extreme riglit has apparently more brachials 

 than the other four, which is a very common occurrence in Pote- 

 riocrinus. Anal plates are not visible in the specimen, being 

 probably imbedded in the rock. The second specimen. Fig. 28, 

 is not suflSciently intelligible. The posterior side is shown, but 

 the arrangement of the anal portion is so obscure that it gives no 

 information whatever. The form of the calyx is like Poteriocri- 

 nus^ subconical, and resembling Fig. 1. 



The third specimen. Figs. 29 and 30, from the Ashmolean col- 

 lection of Oxford, gives only the cal^yx, but this is sufficient to 

 show that it is an entirely different form from that represented by 

 Figs. 1 and 28. The position of the plates, the form of the calyx 

 with strongly convex sides, the peculiar articulating facet of the 

 first radials, their proportions, and the arrangement of the anal 

 area, agree in every respect with Miller's generic diagram,^ and 

 with those species whicli we have mentioned as having no pin- 

 nulte. On the other liand, the first two figures in the subconical 

 form of the calyx, in the disposition and form of the plates, in 

 having two additional brachials in the anterior ray, in the presence 

 of pinnulae, closely resemble Poteriocrinus. This has induced us 

 to consider tlie Ashmolean specimen alone'^ to be Cyathocrinus 

 planus and the type of the genus, and we propose an amendment 

 of the generic formula so as to admit only those species that are 

 without pinnulse, making the latter one of the best distinctions 



' Miller's diagram of the Ashmolean specimen, Fig. 30, appears at first 

 sight to be ver}' different frona the generic diagram of the preceding plate, 

 but it must be understood tliat the four small plates, arranged in the figure 

 in a half circle, are to represent the interradials (oral plates) in the dome, 

 and not the plates of the ventral sac, as might be expected. 



2 We were not aware, when the above was written, that Austin, who ex- 

 amined most of Miller's original specimens, came to almost the same con- 

 clusion in regard to G. planus (Rec. & Foss. Crin., p. 2). He remarks that 

 Miller in some cases lias taken " parts of different animals and jumbled them 

 together" to render liis figures as perfect as possible, and on page 59 he 

 saj's : " Miller's principal figure of the C. planus cannot be depended on, 

 as lie appears to have taken the rays of Taxocrimis longidactylus and placed 

 them on the body of C. planus.''^ In supposing these to be the arms of 

 Taxocrimis, Austin is certainly mistaken. 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PEIILADELPHIA. 305 



between this genus and Poleriocrinns. The truncated posterior 

 basal, the number and disposition of the anal plates, and the 

 regular alternate arrangement of basals and radials are also ex- 

 cellent characters by which the two genera may be easily distin- 

 guished ; but not the construction of the vault, nor the presence 

 or absence of a separate buccal aperture, as Austin and De Koninck 

 suggested; for both genera have a similar low vault with a single 

 aperture, and in both tj'pes the ventral sac is lateral, strong, and 

 upright, instead of extending from the entire summit like an 

 enormous proboscis, as it has been described b}' several authors. 

 De Koninck and Lehon give the number of anal plates at two to 

 six, but there is realh' but one plate that can be regarded as such, 

 all succeeding ones forming a part of the ventral sac. 



Hall, in order to admit into Gyathocrinus such types as were 

 afterwards separated under Ba7-i/ci'inus, mentions in the Iowa Re- 

 port tliat there sometimes occurs in the anal area a rather small 

 intercalated plate; but this, though having a similar position, 

 cannot be considered identical with the lower anal plate of Poterio- 

 crinus. Barycrinus has been very generally accepted as a genus, 

 and as the plate in question has only been observed in species of 

 that type, it need no longer be considered in this connection. 



Angelin, in the Iconographia Crinoideorum, p. 22, mentions the 

 presence in Gyathocrinua of small pinnulae. We have already 

 noticed this point in the introductory remarks, and think we have 

 proved that the two alternate rows of plates, there called pinnuhe, 

 are merclv plates which cover the ambulacral groove in the. arms, 

 and though the}' are, in our opinion, the homologues of the pin- 

 nulse, they are too rudimentary- to be ranked as such. The cover- 

 ing in Cyathocrvnis longimanus Angl., from the Silurian, con- 

 sists of two rows of five successive plates each, one row being 

 given off from the right, the other from the left side of the furrow 

 and perfectly c6vering it. In Gyathocr. lowensis 0. & Shum., from 

 the Subcarboniferous, there have beenobservedonly two successive 

 plates arranged in the same manner. If it could be shown that 

 this structure were constant in all Silurian species of Gyatho- 

 crinus, we should feel disposed to separate them from their sub- 

 carboniferous representatives, at least subgenerically, since in the 

 former the arm-joints are comparatively shorter, the ventral tube 

 stronger, and there is besides a peculiar difference in the general 

 habitus of the two which is not easily expressed. 




306 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1879. 



Sph aerocrinus Roemer is founded upon Cyathocrinus geometri- 

 cus Goldfuss, and it has all the characters of Cyathocrinus, not 

 only in the construction of the calyx, but also of the vault, and 

 we find a contraction of the body in the arm regions in the major- 

 it}^ of its species. 



Palseocrinus Billings is not distinct from Cyathocrinus. The 

 construction of the calyx is identical, and the five cal^^cinal grooves 

 radiating from the centre pf the abdominal surface, which, accord- 

 ing to Billings, form the principal distinction, are identical with the 

 ambulacral grooves passing here as there over the sutures of the 

 oral plates. Cyathocrinus, especially in its Lower Silurian form, 

 and when deprived of the arms, bears the closest relation to some 

 forms of the Blastoids on one side, and the Pentacrinoid larva 

 on the other. We propose the following: — 



Remsed Genet^ic Diagnosis : General form of the bod}^ with 

 arms, elongate ; calyx cyathiform, usually' with convex sides, in- 

 curving toward the upper margin, and, therefore, subglobose in 

 general outline ; S3'mmetry bilateral. 



Underbasals five, moderately large, of equal size, either spread 

 out horizontally or with a slight upward curvature. Basals large, 

 regularly alternating with the radials, with acute upper angles, ex- 

 cept the posterior one which is truncate for the support of a single 

 anal plate. Radials one by five, as large or larger than the basals, 

 incurving toward the vault. Articulating facet rarel}- occupying 

 more than one-half the width of the plate — often less than one-third 

 — and one fourth to one-third its heiglit, It is on the exterior of the 

 plate, circular or elliptic in form, and provided either with a small 

 perforation, or more frequently' with a deep notch which connects 

 with the arm groove. The l)racliials are similar in construction 

 to the arm joints, and their number, as a rule, is very irregular, 

 varying sometimes from two to seven in the same specimen, and 

 even in arms of the same relative position, scarcely' two ra3's 

 having an equal number. 



Arms long, branching, each branch bifurcating several times, 

 and as they graduallj^ taper toward the tips they become very 

 slender above. The arm joints, as well as the brachials in Silu- 

 rian species, are shorter, and comparatively heavier than in spe- 

 cies from the Subcarboniferous. In the former they are about as 

 wide as high, in their later representatives generally three or four 

 times higher than wide. Both, however, agree in the absence of 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 307 



the pinnulte and in the structure of the anibulacral groove, which, 

 instead of those appendages, is provided with two rows of from 

 two to five successive movable ph\tes, alternately arranged on 

 opposite sides, b}' means of which the farrow could be opened to 

 the surrounding element, or shut otf from it. 



Anal plate one, resting upon the superior edge of the truncated 

 basal and between two radials. Xone of the succeeding plates in 

 the series are embraced in the calyx; they are much smaller and 

 form a part of the ventral sac. 



The vault is composed of five large oral plates, joining later- 

 ally, which fit in between the inflected margins of the two radial 

 plates, leaving in the oral centre an open space, which in perfect 

 specimens is completel}' covered h\' the apical dome plates. The 

 food groove and anibulacral canal are also arched over solidlj' by 

 two rows of alternate plates which connect with the movable 

 covering of the arm furrow. The ventral sac extends to about 

 one-half the height of the arms, and is composed of a large num- 

 ber of small plates not so regularh' arranged as in Poteriocrinus. 

 Its communication with the main body internally is maintained 

 by means of a passage pierced through the posterior oral plate. 

 The sac is stronger in the Silurian species, and in them only have 

 pores and slits been observed. 



Column round, with alternate larger and smaller joints in its 

 upper portion; central passage scarcely of medium size. 



Geological position^ etc. — The genus existed in the Lower Silu- 

 rian, was well represented in the Upper Silurian, and attained its 

 greatest abundance in the Subcarboniferous Beyond the age of 

 the Keokuk limestone no trace of it has been discovered, and to- 

 ward the close of that epoch the general aspect of the species un- 

 derwent a marked change, the later species being large, and the 

 arms, which before were delicate, became ver}' robust at the bases. 

 (See Wachsm. & Spr., Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1878, p. 257.) 

 According to Murchison and others, Cyathocrinus is represented 

 in the Permian, but nothing has been discovered upon which to 

 base this opinion bej'ond the fragments of columns, which afford 

 no reliable proof. So far as ascertained there are 4 species from 

 the Lower, 19 from the Upper Silurian; a single one from the 

 Devonian; 28 from the Subcarboniferous, making in all 53 species, 

 of which 27 have been found in Europe, and 2G in America.

Note. — Cyathocrinus Harrodi, u. sp. Form of calyx shallow, cup- 

 shaped, the lower portion truncate and slightly excavated. 



Uudcrbiisals vety small, subquadrangular, spread out horizontalh', and 

 forming a live-rayed star. Basals large, a little wider than high, bending 

 abruptly toward the underbasals in such a manner that the lower half of 

 the plate stands on a level with the latter. The radials are of the size of the 

 basals — perhaps a trifle smaller — once and a half as wide as high, subpentan-

gular. the two lower sides making about a right angle. Articulating scar 

 occupying about one-third the width of the plate, somewhat concave, and 

 facing obliquely outward. Brachials varying from two to four or more in 

 the rays, wider than high, rounded on the exterior, the upper one giving 

 rise to two main arms, each of which branches three times. 



Arms long, decreasing in width at each bifurcation, very delicate at the 

 tips, 'he arm-joints increasing in length upward. Ventral furrow covered 

 by two alternating rows of from two to three pieces. Anal plate small. 



Surface of plates ornamented by strong radiating ridges, two to each 

 radial, which connect with those of the two adjacent basals. They are 

 most prominent on the latter, where they converge toward the middle into 

 a node which points downward. These nodes, and their downward direc- 

 tion, give to the specimen an appearance very like Ollacrinus. Under- 

 basals smooth. 



Column small, round, composed of thin smooth joints, alternating in size ; 

 central perforation round. 



This species is most nearly related to C. lamellosus White, of the Upper 

 Burlington limestone, from which it differs in the number and form of the 

 arms, which in our species are rounded, instead of sharply ridged on the 

 back ; in the surface markings of the calyx, and in the smooth column— 

 that of C. lamellosus being beautifully sculptured. 



The specific name is in honor of Dr. Harrod, of Canton, Ind., to whom 

 we are indebted for the discovery and use of specimens.

Under tliis generic name, Johannes Muller described a species 

 ■whicli, acc(nding to Schultze, was an abnormal specimen of bis 

 Taxocrinus briareus. In the original specimen, which is figured 

 by Schultze, Mon. Elcliinod. d. Eifl. Kalkes, pi, 4, figs. 1 a-e, there 

 are six radials and seven main arms, besides other irregularities 

 in the calyx, i>lainly indicating some disturbance in the natural 

 growth of the animal. 



In the Am. Journ. Sci.. Sept. 1877, one of us expressed a doubt 

 as to T. hriai-eus being a Taxocrinus, and we have since become 

 convinced that its nearest aflinitics are with Cyafhocrinus and 

 Gissocrinus, from both of which it ditTers in the construction of 

 the column, and in the small size of its underbasals. If the species 

 possesses five underbasals, as we believe, it ought to be placed 




312 PROOEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



subgenerically under Gyathocrinxis ; if it has but three, as Scluiltze 

 supposed (they have not been observed), it shouhl be similarly 

 ranked under Gissocrinus^ but at all events under the Cyathocri- 

 nidfe. 



Generic Diagnosis. — General form of the cal^x cj'athiform; 

 symmetry bilateral. 



Underbasals very small, entirel}^ covered by the column, their 

 number not ascertained. Basals five, four of them equal, the fifth 

 or posterior one with the upper side truncate. Radials large, 

 alternating with the basals; articulating faces concave, occupN-ing 

 one-half to two-thirds the width of the plate. Brachials two to 

 four or more, their number varying in the difierent ra^'s, as well 

 as in different individuals. They are very short, the upper one 

 supporting on each sloping side two main arms, which divide on 

 the second or third plate, each division branching several times 

 again. 



Arms long, composed of simple joints, and provided with a dor- 

 sal canaP and a deep ambulacral furrow. Xo pinnulse. 



Anal plate one, constructed as in Cyathocrinus and resting 

 upon the truncate posterior basal. Ventral sac in form of a long 

 tube, constructed of numerous very regular hexagonal plates of 

 equal height, longitudinally arranged in alternately wider and 

 narrower rows. 



The column, which forms the best generic distinction, is obtusely 

 quadrangular, with slightly concave sides, and is composed of very 

 narrow joints of equal size, which are penetrated b\- a large central 

 and four smaller accessory canals, situated within the joints of the 

 four angles.

tricose above the arm bases. Calyx low, neatly ornamented by 

 radiating striai ; symmetry bilateral. 



Underbasals three instead of five, two of them equal and twice 

 as large as the third; the smaller one placed anteriorly, the 

 sutures of the two larger directed to the rear. The plates are so 

 arranged that a bisection of the latter two produces five equal 

 pieces regularly alternating with the succeeding ring of basals. 

 Basals large, four of them pentagonal or hexagonal with sharp 

 upper angles, the fifth longer, hexagonal, truncate above. Radials 

 semi-lunate, larger than the basals, wider than long; articulating 

 facet concave and occupying about one-half tiie width of the plate! 

 The brachials consist either of a single bifurcating plate, which is 

 wider than long, pentangular; or in some species of two smaller 

 plates which combined have about the form and proportions of 

 the single one. 



Arms long, bifurcating, branches very numerous and of almost 

 uniform thickness throughout their length. The divisions take 

 place at regular intervals, but only toward the inner side of the 

 ray, the outer or main arms remaining straight; the inner arms 

 or branches remain simple or in some cases subdivide once or 

 twice. The first bifurcation of the main arms takes place upon 

 the first or second plate above the brachials, the next and all suc- 

 ceeding bifurcations from each first, second, or fourth plate, accord- 

 ing to species. Arm-joints distinctly rounded on the exterior, 

 with parallel sutures, rather higher than wide, the upper margin 

 generally projecting into a band inclosing the lower part of The 

 next plate. The axillary or bifurcating plates the largest, with a 

 sharp angular process at their sides toward the upper margin. Xo 

 pinnuloe. Arm furrows covered by two rows of alternate plates 

 wiiicli stand out prominently forming an elevated arch. 



Anal plate one, which is large, resting upon the truncate basal 

 and supporting the ventral sac, which has the form of a tube. The 

 tube is long, sometimes extending beyond the tii)S of the arms, 

 rather strong; cylindrical except at its junction with the main 

 body, where it liecomcs much contracted toward one side; the 

 inner passage elliptic, almost linear in its cross section. It is 

 composed of qurulrangular plates longitudinally arranged, leaving 

 a dee|) furrow between the rows lined with fissures which penetrate 

 the test.

^^ocrinws, except that the arms are recumbent upon the vault. There 

 are five oral plates, upon the sutures between vvhicli, and raised 

 above the general level, the arm-joints arc imbedded, being covered 

 by small alternating plates like tlie free arms. 



Column round, composed of joints of alternating thickness. 

 Gissocrinus approaches nearest the Silurian form of Cyatho- 

 crinus ; indeed the form of the cal3'x and the general aspect are 

 strikingly similar. But they differ in the number of underbasals, 

 which in this genus are reduced to three. Angelin places Gi><HO- 

 crinus with Forbesiocrinus and both under the Taxocrinidae, which 

 is certainly not a natural group. The long slender proboscis, the 

 single ring of radials within the cal^^x, show clearly that this genus 

 belongs to tlie Cyathocrinldiie.

 18G6. Gcol. Rep. Illinois, vol. ii. p. 177. 



The above name, with Cijathocrinus? bulbosus ITall as type, 

 was i)roposecl b3'Meek and Worthen for a little group of Crinoiils 

 which are distinguished b}' their spider-like appearance. The 

 calyx in these species, as conii)ared with the long and robust arms, 

 is extremely small, hemisphericaUand forms a bulb-like protuber- 

 ance, from which tlie arms spread horizontally. These characters 

 distinguish this form readil}' from Cyathocrinus, with which it 

 otherwise agrees, and the}' are so remarkable that we feel con- 

 strained to consider Arachnocrinus a distinct genus, and not a 

 subgenus, as suggested by its authors. 



We had latel}' the pleasure of examining the splendid collections 

 of Dr. Knapp in Louisville, where we found two exceedingly in- 

 teresting specimens, representing different species of this genus, 

 both new. In one, the arms are almost closed, in the other spread 

 out horizontally, thus demonstrating clearh' that this Crinoidwas 

 capable of folding up its arms, and bringing them to an erect posi- 

 tion, which has been doubted bv Meek and Worthen, who could 

 not conceive how an animal with so small a visceral cavity' could 

 have sufficient muscular power to move such ponderous arms. Dr. 

 Knapp kindly permits us to describe the two si)ecies, whicli will 

 be known as A. Knappi and A.exlem^us. Roeraer's Poteriocrinus 

 pisiformis, which Meek and Worthen refer to this genus, is but 

 imperfectly known, but we do not doubt that the reference is 

 correct. We also place in this genus Cyathocrijius granalatus 

 Angelin, though it differs from the other species in the brachials, 

 which are restricted to one to each rav. We propose the follow- 

 ing:— 



Generic Diagt^osis. — Cah'x very small, TescmhWngCyalhorrinus 

 in the arrangement of the plates, but more depressed ; basal por- 

 tion rounded. Arms exceedingly robust, generall}' stretched out 

 horizontall}-, and arranged around the body, as tiie arms in As- 

 trophylon around the disc. 



Underbasals five, small, apparently of equal size. Basals five, 

 the posterior one truncate. Radials wider than high, articulating 

 scar occupying almost the entire width <^)f the plate, and more or 

 less concave. Tlie number of bracliials dilfers in the rays, as many 

 as fourteen having been observed ; they are cylindrical, wider than 




316 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1879. 



high, and resemble in form and construction the joints of the lieavy 

 arms. 



Arms long, ramifying several times towards the inner part of 

 the ray, the main arms and brandies scarcely diminishing in size; 

 in fact the joints near the tips of the arms are almost as large as 

 the brachials. Both are generally short, quadrangular, except the 

 bifurcating plates, which are comparatively longer. Ambulacral 

 furrow deep. Pinnuloe wanting. 



Anal plate one, small, resting upon the truncate basal, and sup- 

 porting a lateral tube which is in line with the arm bases. Tlie 

 ventral tube was evidently small. In A. Knajjpi it apparently 

 rests directly upon the basal, or probably the anal plate forms a 

 part of the ventral sac. The vault is surmounted by five large 

 oral plates — all other plates in the dome unknown. 



Column round, of alternately larger and smaller joints. 



Geological Position^ etc. — Confined to the Upper Silurian and 

 Devonian so far as known, and found both in. Europe and America.

' AracJmocrimis extensus, n. sp. The body of the only known specimen 

 is not ill a condition to exhibit satisfactorily the arrangement and propor- 

 tions of all the plates, but enough is visible to show that the calyx closely 

 resembles that of Arachnocr. bulbosus. Its plates are smooth, the under- 

 basals small, and projecting but little beyond the column. Arms massive, 

 bifurcating on the second brachial, except in the anterior ray which divides 

 on the 14th or 15th plate, and branches further up four times; the two 

 lateral rays branch five, the two posterior rays six times. The arms are 

 long and stretched out horizontally to their full length. Arm joints almost 

 as large as the brachials and like them cylindrical, much wider than long — 

 except the bifurcating plates which arc always comparatively longer, with 

 a thickened rim both at their upper and lower margins.

Hall— Advance Sheets Pal. New York, Vol. Y., Part II., p. G, 

 containing a list of the Devonian fossils occurring at the falls of 

 the Ohio — placed both species of L^-on's Vasocrinus under Cya- 

 tlxocrinu$^'\\\ \v\\\q\\ he was apparently justified ; for Lyon in de- 

 scribing the genus failed to point out any characters by which it 

 might be distinguished from Gyathocrimis^ except perhaps the 

 peculiar form of the bodv. In liis generic description Lyon men- 

 tions the presence of only a single anal plate, but at the same time 

 describes his second species with two anals. On examining the 

 original specimens, both of F. valens and V. sculptutt, in the col- 

 lection of Dr. Knapp, we arrived at the conclusion that Lyon was 

 correct in separating these species from Cyathocrinus, And further- 

 more, that they are intimately related to certain other species 



umn. Basals large, larger than the radials, and partly included within the 

 concavity. Radials of unequal size — the posterior ones smaller — semilunu- 

 late; articulating facet strongly excavated, facing outward and almost cir- 

 cular in outline. Brachials very heav}', their number varying in the rays. 

 In the original specimen the left posterior ray has fourteen brachials ; the 

 right posterior — evidently recuperated and hence perhaps not showing its 

 normal condition — has eight ; the lateral rays twelve to fourteen, and the 

 anterior ray fourteen. The first and only bifurcation visible in the speci- 

 men takes place on the second, third, or fourth plate. Arms erect, being 

 otherwise built upon the same plan as in A. exteiuus. Arm joints as heavy 

 as the brachials, cyhndrical, much wider than high, with parallel sutures, 

 and without pinnula;. All these plates appear as if constricted in the mid- 

 dle, on account of the thickening of the plates toward the sutures. Anal 

 arrangement not clearly disclosed in the specimen, but there appears to be 

 a rather large lateral oponing directl}' above tlie posti-rior busal and be- 

 tween two adjoining radials. We can observe no special anal plate, and if 

 it were present it was evidently small, and perhaps formed a part of the ven- 

 tral tube, wliich toward tlie dome is supported by an elongate lozenge- 

 shaped oral plate. F'our additional oral plates of a similar form cover the 

 ventral side. Apical dome plates, and the covering of the ambulacral 

 furrow, not preserved. Uamiltou Group. Devouiau. Near Charleston,

which have been referred to various genei^a and alwa^'S with diffi- 

 culty. 



In reconstructing the genus, we prefer to make Vasocrinus Ly- 

 oni {Cyalhocrinus Lyoni Hall), from Crawfordsville, the type, 

 because it is found more perfectly preserved in the arm portion ; 

 but we scarcely doubt, to judge from the brachials, as far as they 

 are preserved, that the arms in the Devonian species were con- 

 structed in a like manner. 



Bevised Generic Diagnosis. — Calyx shaped like a low vase ; 

 plates thin. Underhasals five, rather small, forming a regular 

 pentagon. Basals large, almost as high as wide, generally' de- 

 pressed toward their angles, four pentagonal or hexagonal, the 

 fifth with an additional side. Radials always wider than high, 

 the upper portion strongl}' inflected toward the dome. Articulat- 

 ing facet, concave occupying about one-third of the plates, almost 

 circular, deeplj' notched for the ambulacral groove. Brachials 

 resembling the arm plates, but slightly wider. In Vasocr. Lyoni, 

 the only species in which their number is perfectly known, there 

 are two by five ( V. valens had at least as many), with two arms 

 to the ray. 



Arms long, moderatel}^ heavy, tapering gradually to the tips. 

 They are simple throughout, so far as observed, but in place of 

 branching they throw off armlets alternatel}' from each side, and 

 these branch once or twice, as in Botryocrinus and Barycrinas^ 

 tliough the}' are less robust. 



Anal area wide; anal plates generall}- two, rarely one, arranged 

 as in Barycrinus. There is one large plate situated between two 

 radials, and a smaller one placed obliquel}' toward the rigiit side 

 of the specimen, and between two basals, the riglit posterior radial 

 and the larger anal. The ventral sac, as observed in V. Lyoni, 

 extends to more than half the length of the arms. It is rather 

 heav}-, with a series of large quandrangular plates at the base,* 

 the lower ones as wide, but much higher than the radials. All 

 tlie other plates of the sac are much smaller, decreasing in size 

 upward. Construction of the vault unknown. 



' Tliese plates, which are much heavier and larger than any other plates 

 of the tube, in their longitudinal arrangement and rounded exterior, 

 strongly resemble an arm, and were taken by Lyon and Casseday, who de- 

 scribed this species as Cyathocr. hexadactylus, for arm plates of a sixth 

 ray, and the large anal plate upon which Ihey rest, for a radial. 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 319 



Column round, undivided longitudinalh* (except in V. dllata- 

 tus)', central perforation scarce!}' of medium size. 



This genus occupies a position SN'stematically between Ci/atho- 

 crimis on the one side and Botryocrinvji and Barycrinus on the 

 other. It differs from Barycrinuti in the delicacy of its bod}' plates, 

 in having two brachials instead of one, in the less robust arms, 

 and in having a round column with a comparatively small and 

 simply constructed passage, in contrast to the pentagonal, divided 

 column, and wide and complicated central canal of that genus. 

 From Bolryocrinus it differs in the form of the ventral sac and 

 the construction of tlie arms. 



Geological Position, etc. — Devonian and Subcarboniferous ; only

 1878. Iconogr. Crin, Suec, p. 24. 



In the form and structure of tlie cal3-x this type resembles 

 Cyafhocrinns, but in the position of the arms it is like Arachno- 

 crinus, from which it is perhaps only subgenerically distinct. 



TJnderbasals five, four of medium size, equal, thin, upper edges 

 meeting at right angles, except the fifth is truncated above. Radials 

 five, lunulate ; articulating surface deeply concave, and occupying 

 almost the entire width of the plate. Brachials spreading out 

 horizontal!}', varjnng in number from one to four in the different 

 rays ; ver}'" short but heavy. Only one anal plate. 



Arms directed downward ; composed of joints similar to the 

 brachials, being, however, slightly narrower and longer. Total 

 length of arms unknown. 0. crotalurus had apparently onl}- ten 

 arms ; in the original specimen some eight or nine arm joints are 

 preserved without any signs of bifurcation. The arm grooves are 

 rather narrow, covered by two rows of plates ; with short lateral 

 grooves given off from each side of the main furrow, within the 

 arm joints, similarl}' covered, and which are evidently recumbent 

 pinnulse. 



The condition of the ventral sac is the most remarkable feature 

 of the genus. Instead of going straight upward, it bends close 

 to the base, and coils upon itself spirall}' twice, decreasing in 

 thickness toward the upper end. It is composed of regular rows 

 of hexagonal plates alternately arranged, with a rather deep 

 longitudinal ridge bordered with fissures on each side. 



Column round, of alternate larger and smaller joints; central 

 perforation of medium size. 



This genus resembles Cyathocrinus, but is easily distinguished 

 by its peculiar pendent arms, recumbent pinuuloe, and remarkable 

 proboscis.

A. Typical form. 



The crinoids of this type resemble in general form a tree with 

 many branches and branchlets. Calyx small, cyathiform, un- 

 symmetrical. 



ITnderbasals five, slightly protuberant. Basals five, three of 

 them equal, the other two of somewhat different form, due to their 

 abutting against the anal plates. Radials large, articulating sur- 

 face concave, occup^'ing more than three-fourths of the width of 

 the plate. Brachials less than one-half the size of the radials, 

 wider than high, their number varying in the rays from two to 

 five. 



Each ray is composed of two main arms from which, through- 

 out their entire length, spring two rows of branches, given off on 

 alternate sides from ever}- second or third joint, and which ex- 

 tend to the ver}' top of the specimen. The secondary arms branch 

 again, throwing off branchlets right and left, wliich themselves 

 ramif}', thus producing branches of a third and fourth order. The 

 main arms are heavy, almost as wide at tlie base as the brachials, 

 and decreasing in size very gradually toward the tips. The sec- 

 ondary branches are about two-thirds the size of the former, and 

 those of the succeeding orders are slender, short, not reaching to 

 the top of the specimen. The plates of arms and branches of cor- 

 responding position, throughout the specimen, are of equal width 

 and height, those of the branches being relatively shorter. Ar- 

 ticulating face of arm joints and brachials circular. 



Anal plates two, arranged as \n Homocrinus ; the lower one 

 rhomboidal, situated between two basals, the right posterior radial 

 and the second anal. The latter is larger, similar in form to the 

 radials, almost as large, and in line with them. Ventral sac of 

 medium width, composed of verj- regular hexagonal plates, alter- 

 nately arranged in rows. It is in form of a tube, and ascends 

 almost vertically to about one-fourth the lengtli of the arm, where 

 it bends abruptly' towards the posterior side and coils upon itself 

 like a snail. Anal aperture apparently located anteriorly at the 

 very base of the tube. 



Vault composed of a large number of small plates the exact ar- 

 rangement of which has not been ascertained. 



Column round, composed of thin joints. 



Botryocrinus agrees closest with Barycrinus, to the description 

 of which we refer for comparison.

Geological position^ etc. — Known only in the Upper Silurian of 

 Sweden, where it is represented by the two following species: —

B. Subgenus SICYOCRINUS Angelin. 

 1878. Iconogr. Crin. Suec, p. 23. 



Sicijocrinus cuciirhitaceufi Angelin, the onh' known species of 

 this type, is so clo.«ely related to Botryocrinus that wc tliink it 

 should be placed thereunder as a subgenus. The calyx, in form 

 and arrangement of plates, is alike in both, and even the arms and 

 ventral sac are constructed upon the same plan, but which is dif- 

 ferently executed. 



In Sicyocrimis there are five single arms, in place of five pairs, 

 which give off branches from one side only, and not alternatel}' 

 from both sides as in the typical form. The branches, which are 

 represented up to the fourth order, diverge from the arm at a less 

 angle, and those of the third and fourth orders are comparatively 

 longer. The bracliials, as well as the arm joints throughout the 

 branches, are from two to three and even four times longer than 

 wide, and have a deep ambulacral furrow. The ventral sac, as in 

 Boti'yocrinus, first ascends, then turns abruptlj' toward the pos- 

 terior side, and bends until its extremit^^ points downwards. It 

 is now very remarkable that the portion of the tube which is bent 

 over is not only firmly attached exteriorly to the lower part by a 

 growth of plates, but rt appears that its inner passage followed 

 the curvature of the tube, for on each lateral surface there are two 

 rows of fissures wliicli follow exactly' the line of deflection. Col- 

 umn obscurely pentagonal.

 1868. Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phil,, p. 338. 



This genus was founded upon a group of Crinoids which had 

 formerly been referred by Hall and Meek & Worthen to Cyafho- 

 crinus, differing, however, from it in several strongly marked fea- 




18T9.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 323 



tures In the first place the species are more robust, having 

 tliicker and more ponderous plates which form a more shallow 

 cup. Tiiey also differ in having generally an extra quadrangular 

 anal piece, which is inserted toward the right lower margin of the 

 other anal, and although it is often very small, and in some rare 

 cases entirely wanting, it is characteristic as a rule, while such a 

 plate never occurs in Cyathocriniis. A more constant difference 

 is observable in the brachials, which are proportionall}' shorter 

 and wider, particularly the fii'st one, which often presents an almost 

 linear appearance. In Cyalhocrinus the number of brachials is 

 ver3- irregular, but in Barycrinus, without exception, it is fixed at 

 two. The best means of distinction, however, is afforded bj' the 

 arms, which in Barycrinus are composed of rather short, heav}', 

 rounded i)ieces, with very narrow ambulacral grooves, while Cya- 

 thocrinus has rather slender arms and wide, deep furrows. The 

 arms also instead of regularl}- dichotomizing, so as to form equal 

 divisions, are simple in Baryrrhius and give off armlets at regular 

 intervals. The column in this genus is almost unique in its con- 

 struction, and very distinct from that of Cyathocriniis. It is not 

 only stouter and subpentagonal, but is divided longitudinally into 

 five sections, and has a large, highly organized central canal. 



Baryrrinus has its closest affinities with Botryocrinus Angl., 

 with whicii it agrees in the general construction of the arms and 

 in the anal arrangement, but from which it is easily distinguished 

 by its massive body plates, the number and proportion of its bra- 

 chials, and by the column. 



Generic Diagnosis. — General form of the calyx basin or low 

 cup-shaped ; often attaining a gigantic size ; plates massive, more 

 or less gil)bous or protul)erant. Surface coarsely corrugated, 

 granulated, or striated, with frequently a depression at each angle 

 between the plates. 



Underbasals five, of less tl)an medium size, fully one-half extend- 

 ing be^'ond the column, their points in form of little triangles bent 

 upward. 



Basals large, three of them — sometimes four — hexagonal, the 

 other two heptagonal. Radials five, very unequal in size, the 

 right posterior and often the anterior one much the lowest, all of 

 them wider than high, pentagonal in outline ; articulating scar 

 facing outward, concave, occupying from one-half to fully two- 

 thirds the width of the plate. Brachials, two to each ray, wide 




324 , PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



and short, articulating face circular; thefirst one extremely sliort 

 in the middle, one fourth as high as wide, and becoming still thin- 

 ner or wedge-shaped at each side ; the second is a little longer in 

 proportion and presents a subtrigonal outline, supporting on its 

 sloping upper sides two arras. 



Arms moderatel}^ lo"gi robust, scarcely decreasing in size, and 

 generally simple throughout, though sometimes they branch once 

 on the third or fourth plate in some of the ra3's — but never in 

 the anterior one — and only in one arm to a ray, the other arm 

 always remaining simple. In one species, probably' B. liimidus 

 Hall, from the Keokuk limestone, the antero-lateral ra3's are en- 

 tirelj'^ simple, the arm plates and brachials forming a continuous 

 series. All the main arms, instead of bifurcating, give off at 

 regular intervals, alternately on opposite sides, and from the inner 

 margins of the plates, short, rounded, simple armlets, which in 

 most species throw off secondar}'' branches as in Botryocrinus, and 

 these armlets, here as there, probably performed the office of pin- 

 nulae. The arm joints are simple, round, mostly shorter than 

 wide, with a nai'row, almost linear ambulacral furrow. 



Anal plates generally two, never more. The lower plate which 

 is often xery small is wanting in some few species, and in very 

 young specimens is frequently undeveloped, but when present, it 

 is located against the posterior basal and beneath the right radial ; 

 the larger, which stands in line with the radial, is generally of 

 about their height and half their width, quadrangular in outline. 

 "Ventral sac and vault unknown, but both were evidently of a 

 delicate structure, as we have never seen a trace of them in an^^ of 

 our specimens. 



Column short, obtusely pentagonal, divided longitudinally into 

 five sections, which are in a radial position. The sutures are in- 

 terradial, the opposite of Heterocrimis in which the}'' are radial; 

 they are bordered by little pores which apparently communicated 

 with the large pentangular central canal at its five angles. These 

 sutures extend throughout the entire length of the stem and partly 

 to the radicular cyrrhi, which are strong, raniif3'ing, and radially 

 situated. The genus had evidentl}^ no c^'rrhi along the column, 

 for we have examined with reference to this point a number of 

 specimens showing several feet of stem from near the bod}' to, and 

 including the root, without discovering any trace of them. The 

 radicular cirrhi, which are long and strong, are given off radially. 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 325 



The inner canal is large throughout and increases in size toward 

 the root. 



Geological position^ etc. — The genus has a very limited range. 

 It occurs so far as known only in the Subcarboniferous, and in 

 America, where it first appears in the Lower Burlington lime- 

 stone. It is found in the greatest profusion and size in the Keo- 

 kuk, and has only two representatives in the Warsaw, where it 

 becomes extinct. 



AYe recognize 23 species, 2 of them being doubtful.

In no other genus of the Crinoids is there found so much con- 

 fu.sion as in the one now under consideration. This is partly due 

 to the imperfect preservation of the specimens from which the 

 earlier descriptions were made, and also, no douiit, to the species 

 themselves upon which Miller founded the genus. Neither of his 

 two species of Poferitxrimis can be considei*ed characteristic types 

 of the genus, and unfortunately among his four species of C^/a- 

 thoorinus — the genus witli which Poteriocrinus was afterwards 

 so often confounded — only one can be properly- claimed for that 

 genus, two of them having been later referred to very distinct 

 groups, and the fourth is a Poteriocrinus. 



According to Miller, the pelvis of Poteriocrinus is composed 

 of five pentagonal plate-like joints, supporting five hexagonal in- 

 tercostal plate-like joints, and five plate-like scapulaj with an 

 intercostal and an interscapulary plate interposed; an arm pro- 

 ceeds from each scapula; column round, composed of narrow 

 joints with a central perforation. Tins embraces everytliing in 

 Miller's description which might be deemed of generic importance, 




328 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [ISTQ. 



but it is fully sufficient for identification, as it aflfords the means 

 of separating this form from the only other genus of this family 

 then known. It gives us unquestionable evidence of the existence 

 of at least two anal plates within the cal3'x, which are plainly 

 shown in the diagrams ; while in ]\[iller's typical species of Cya 

 thocrinus only a single anal plate is mentioned or figured, which 

 is wedged in between the scapulae or first radial plates. 



In the description of P. crasaus, which is Miller's first species, 

 and ought to be the tj'pe of the genus, he gives additional infor- 

 mation regarding the scapuljB or radials. They are described as 

 thin plates, obliquely truncated at the upper margins, excavated 

 with a horseshoe-like impression occupying scarcely more than 

 one-third the width of the plates. Miller's second species agrees 

 well with the preceding. It has only one brachial, which is a 

 bifurcating plate, narrow, four to five times longer than wide, 

 supporting an arm on each side. Only one arm is preserved 

 which has the same dimensions as the brachial, and a deep ambu- 

 lacral furrow. Miller also found minute plates indicating that 

 the abdominal cavity and perhaps also the excavated sulci in the 

 arms were protected b}' a plated integument. 



It thus appears that the calyx of Poteriocrinus, acccording to 

 Miller, is composed of three rings of plates, 5 underbasals, 5 basals, 

 and .5 radials ; that there are not less than two anal plates, one alter- 

 nating with the basals (intercostals) and another between the ra- 

 dials ; that the radials in the two then known species are excavated 

 for the attachment of the brachials, the articulating scar occupy- ing 

 onl}' one-third the width of the plate; that in P. tennis, the onl}' 

 species in which any part above the calyx was known, there is onl}'' 

 a single brachial which is a very long, slender plate, and that the 

 arm joints, so far as known, were found to be long and propor- 

 tioned like the brachials. The calyx of both species is subconical, 

 and both came from the Subcarboniferous of England. Miller 

 describes the basals as being hexagonal, which is not quite cor- 

 rect. It was shown by de Koninck and Lehon that three of the 

 subradials (basals) are hexagonal or heptagonal and of a similar 

 form, while the other two — those in contact with the anal plates — 

 have one or two additional sides, and are slightly larger. The 

 same authors also point out the fact, that four of the radials are 

 of equal size, pentagonal, regularly alternating with the basals, 

 but that the right posterior one, which is rather smaller and 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 339 



elevated above the line of the others, is less regular in form and 

 rests upon the truncated upper side of the basal and against 

 the two anal pieces, dilTerlng therein from Cyafhrx.-Hnuf^, in which 

 basals and radials alternate all around. They consider the latter 

 a ver^' important distinction between the two genera, but they 

 further assert that the best character for separation is to be found 

 in the presence of a single aperture in the dome of Poteriocrinus^ 

 and of a separate oral and anal opening in Cyathocrinus. This 

 unfortunate and altogether incorrect statement on the part of de 

 Koninck has caused the utmost confusion, and when it was shown 

 by Meek & Worthen that the supposed oral aperture is closed in 

 perfect specimens in the one as well as in the other, some of the 

 leading authorities in Europe, who had previously expressed their 

 doubts as to the genus Cyathocrinus^ wished to abandon it alto- 

 gether. We, for our part, cannot endorse this proposition, for we 

 think that the two genera are nicely defined b}- good generic char- 

 acters; and that has been the opinion of the American Paleon- 

 tologists generally', which has i)robal)h' arisen from the fact that 

 this country' has produced fur better specimens. 



But while American authors agree thus far, they differ in regard 

 to the proper limits of the genera. When in the course of recent 

 3'ears a great variety of forms of Foterioerinus were discovered, 

 Hall undertook to divide them subgenerically, but in this he was 

 not very successful. In establishing his subgenus SccqjhiocrinuSy 

 he selected ,^raphiocr. (?) simplex as type, a species which in its 

 anal arrangement and arm structure, though clearl}- distinct 

 from Foterioerinus, SLgvees exactly with Graph iorriniis de Koninck 

 & Lehon. The majorit}- of species, however, which were described 

 under Scaphiocrinus, agree substantially-, both iu the arms and 

 anal area, with Poteriocrinus, and we see no possibilit}- of separat- 

 ing them. This may appear strange, for, on looking over a large 

 collection of Poteriocrinus, it seems to embrace a number of very 

 different grou|)S; but an attempt to separate them will invariably 

 result in finding but few species agreeing in the same points. 



Hall defines Scaphiocrinus as follows: radials 2x5, botli pen- 

 tagonal, the first with the upper side straight or oliliquely concave, 

 the second with the lower side straight, often much elonfjated, 

 and the plates contracted or concave on each side; anals four or 

 rnore; arms double from tiieir origin, or rarelj' simple ii] the 

 anterior ray; arm plates simple, often wedge-shaped, with pinnulae 

 22 




330 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1879. 



originating on the longer side of the plate; the line of articulation 

 between first and second radials more or less gaping exteriorly, 

 and the edge of the plate rounded. Among the species referred 

 to Scaphiocrinus there are some with two brachials (three radials, 

 Hall), others with but one; some with long slender brachials, 

 others with short ones; some in which the brachials occupy the 

 entire width of the upper margin of the radials, others scarcely 

 one-third, and with a horseshoe-like articulating scar ; some with 

 a shallow almost concave calyx, others with a nearly cylindrical 

 one; in some species the arms are simple, with short joints, in others 

 branching, with long joints, or vice versa; in some the pinnulae 

 are strong, and the arms zigzag, in others thin and short, and the 

 arms straight; but all agree, with the exception of tlie few species 

 which we refer to Graphiocrinus (and among the latter Hall's 

 Scaphiocr. simplex)^ in the construction of the anal area, which is 

 exactly as described in Poteriocriniis^ and in having a strong 

 cylindrical or slightly club-shaped ventral sac. 



Our own attempt to subdivide Poteriocrinus subgenerically met 

 with but little better success, though we had the advantage of 

 subsequent discoveries. A division based upon the number of 

 free radials — or brachials as they are now called — cannot be carried 

 out practically. Species with two brachials are not otherwise 

 distinct from those with but one, and Hall himself, who founded 

 Scaphiocrinus upon the presence of a single brachial, and likewise. 

 Meek and Worthen, included therein several species with an addi- 

 tional brachial. In this they were evidently justified, for the 

 additional plate, according to our views, is only a supplementary 

 piece, which facilitates the motion of the arms, but has no effect 

 upon the general structure of the animal. The two brachials 

 combined have the form and size of the single one — in fact it is a 

 compound plate, and this term properlj^ expresses its relations. 



Xor can the gaping sutures be regarded as of generic import- 

 ance. We look upon this structure merely as another mode of 

 articulation — taking place upon a straight hinge line instead of a 

 sloping semicircular scar — and the gradations from one form to 

 another are so close, that it is impossible to separate groups tliereby. 

 Nevertheless, to facilitate the identification of species, which is 

 always difficult when there is a large number in a single group, 

 we have separated Poteriocrinus, as well as could be ascertained 

 from the descriptions and figures, with the aid of our own exten- 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 331 



sive collections, into six divisions, for which we propose distinct 

 nanaes. In doing so, however, we wish to have it understood that 

 we scarcely deem the characters upon wliich they are based suffi- 

 ciently important even for subgeneric separation. Still better dis- 

 tinctions may be discovered hereafter, and in the mean time this 

 arrangement will prove very convenient for comparative study. 



The genus Poleriocrinus, of which there are now over a hundred 

 species known and described, was thought by Miller to be repre- 

 sented altogether by two, and of these the material at his com- 

 mand was very limited and imperfect, so that probably in order 

 to make the most of what he had — to render his descriptions as 

 perfect as possible and to prove some of his theories more effectu- 

 ally — he in some cases reconstructed the specimens from frao-- 

 mentary pieces, which he supposed to be parts of the same species, 

 but which, as we now know, belonged, at least in some instances, 

 to different genera. The fact that Miller's figures cannot be re- 

 lied upon, and that his best original specimens can nowhere be 

 found (Austin), has produced continual trouble. Some of his 

 species have been badly defined by subsequent writers. This is 

 evidently the cJse with his typical species P. crassus. It is true 

 Miller's figures are not so intelligible as might be wished, yet 

 they prove plainly that the plates of the calyx in that species are 

 thin, with elevations radiating from a point near the centre of the 

 plates and meeting at the sutures those from adjoinincr plates. 

 Such costae — as these elevations have often been called — are found 

 very prominent in several species of Poteriocrinus from the Bur- 

 lington limestone, and in these they are not mere external mark- 

 ings, but are produced by a flexure of the plate itself. That the 

 structure was similar in P. crassus^ is plainly indicated by Fio-. 7 G 

 which represents folds on the inner surface of a radial — not inter- 

 costal, as Miller makes it. In the figures of de Koninck's so-called 

 P. crassus^ the plates, on the contrary, are massive, without plica- 

 tions, the surface simply granulose, and the articulating scar 

 which in Millers specimens scarcely fills one-third the width of 

 the radials, extends almost the entire breadth of the plate. Strano-e 



as it may appear, it seems as if de Koninck took the plications 



which in Miller's principal figures soraewliat indistinctly resemble 

 tiie parasitic excrescences of one of his own specimens — to be the 

 work of parasites ; and in no other way can we account for his 

 supposing such distinct forms to belong to the same species. The 




332 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



same clifiicult}' exists in regard to Austin's figures, who has repre- 

 sented under P. crassiis two or more distinct species. 



The identification of P. tenuis^ Miller's second species, is equally 

 doubtful, and in our opinion altogether unreliable. The arms as 

 there figured certainly do not belong to that calyx nor that column, 

 and we are confident that the two latter pertain to Polerioci^inus 

 and the former to Gyathocrinus. We may here remark that while 

 we have experienced scarcel}'^ any difficulty in referring the known 

 species to Poteriocrinus and Gyathocrinus respectively, we find 

 in all of Miller's species, in one way or another, characters alto- 

 gether at variance with the rules we have laid down for distinguish- 

 ing the two genera. Under these circumstances the question arises 

 whether it is not in the interest of science to adopt a new or at 

 least an additional tj'^pe for the genus. This ma}' somewhat con- 

 flict with the rules and practices of naturalists, but in this case we 

 consider it the only adequate remedy- We accordingly propose 

 for this purpose Poteriocrinus notahilis Meek & Worthen, from 

 the Burlington limestone, the original of which, formerly in the 

 collection of C. W. and now in the Museum of Comp. Zool. of 

 Cambridge, Mass., is figured in the Geol. Rep. I^., vol. v., pi. 1, 

 fig. 9. We have selected this species because it is found in very 

 perfect preserA'ation, and because it agrees most closely with Mil- 

 ler's typical species, and certainly belongs to the same division. 



Making this the typical form, we further propose as sections 

 under it Scaphiocrinus Hall, with S. dichotomus Hall's second 

 species (the first being referi'ed to Graphiocriniis) for t3'pe ; 

 Parisocrinus W. & Spr., with Poteriocr. perplexus M. & W. ; 

 Pachylocrinus W. &• Spr., with Poteriocr. suhsequalis W. & Spr. 

 (Hall's Poteriocr. aequalis); Scytalocrinus W. & Spr., with Poteri- 

 ocr. 7^obustiis Hall, Decadocrinus^ with Scaphiocr. scala7'is M. & 

 W., respectively as types; and as we regard these sections rather 

 as variations of the genus, Avhich hardly rise to the dignit}^ of 

 subgenera, we shall for the present write the names with that of 

 the parent genus prefixed. There are some other species, only 

 known from the calyx which could not be satisfactorilj' arranged 

 under the above groups, and these will be found in a list by them- 

 selves. 



Generic Diagnosis. — General form of bod}- with arms, elongate, 

 subc^'lindrical, expanding uniformly upward. Calyx very variable

in shai)e, subconical or subturhinate, sometimes bell, cup, or almost 

 saucer-shaped; arrangement of plates uns3'mmetrieal. 



Underbasals five, equal in form and size, forming a more or less 

 depressed pentagonal eup. Basals five, three of them hexagonal 

 or heptagonal, and of the same size, the two others — those adjacent 

 to the anals — slightly larger, and with one or two additional sides. 

 Radials wider than high, four of a similar pentagonal form, and 

 alternating regularly with the basals; the fifth slightly smaller, 

 elevated above the level of the others, less regular in form, resting 

 upon the truncated upper side of one basal and against two anal 

 pieces. Articulating surface very variable, the scar for tiie attach- 

 ment of the brachials occupying in the t3'pical species scarcely 

 one-third of the upi)er edge, but in some species it extends across 

 the entire margin of the radials with a hinge-like apparatus for 

 articulation. Brachials one to two or tpore, their number the 

 same in four of the rays, the anterior having often a few additional 

 plates. In species with onl}' one brachial it is generally long and 

 laterally constricted; in those with two brachials, the first is 

 quadrangular and short, and both combined are equivalent in form 

 and size to the single plate of the other t^'pe. 



Arms simple or branching; the anterior I'a}', frequently less 

 developed than the others, is sometimes simple througliout ; com- 

 posed of single joints, generally' at least as high as wide, often 

 much higher,' more or less wedge-shaped, and throwing ofl!" pinnulae 

 alternatel3\ In species wliose pinnules have a decidedly zigzag 

 arrangement the}' are remarkably strong. 



Anals three (rarely four) within the calyx, in two rows alter- 

 nately arranged; the lower one pentagonal, resting against the 

 sloping upper side of the posterior basal and the radial to the 

 right ; the second supported b}-- the upper truncated side of the 

 posterior basal, having on the left a radial, on the right the first 

 and third anal plates, the third being sometimes partly above the 

 level of the calyx. Succeeding plates hexagonal, decreasing' in 

 size upwards, forming a j)art of tiie ventral sac. Ventral sac up- 

 right, strong, cylindrical, sometimes club-shaped, either extending 

 up to the top of tiie arms or more tiian half way, frequently 

 crowned with a set of long spines. Plates of the sac hexagonal, 

 and pierced at the sutures witl» pores or fissures, which penetrate 

 the lateral margins of the plates. Anal o()ening rarely observed,

but in all cases, so far as known, low down and situated laterally, 

 not posteriorly. 



Dome constructed like that of Cyathocrinus. Apical dome 

 plates frequently pushed toward the front b}' the large ventral sac. 



Column round or pentagonal, composed of thin joints with a 

 small central aperture. 



Geological po.Hilio)}, etc. — Foferiocrinus has not been found in 

 the Silurian, neither in this country nor in Europe; the few species 

 which were recorded from that age having since been referred to 

 Dendrocrinus^ Homocrinus, etc. It flourished to some extent in 

 the Devonian, but reached its climax both in variety of form and 

 number of individuals in the Snbcarboniferons. There are known 

 17 species from the Devonian and 99 from the Subcarboniferous, 

 of which 27 are from Europe and 89 from America. The species 

 are arranged under the respective sections as follows: — 



A. Typical form. 



Calvx obconical, plates delicate, with elevated wrinkles or radi- 

 ating plications. Radials with a semicircular scar facing outward, 

 and deeply notched, not filling the full width of the plate. Bra-

 Sutures somewhat gaping. Arms long and branching. Ventral 

 sac very long and heavy. Column round.

This species shades into several genera, and 'cannot be satis-

 Zeao'iniis^ but the arms are simple instead of bifurcating; it 

 agrees with Eupachycrinus in the form of the calyx and in the 

 anal area.

Upper Subcarb. Near Moscow, Russia 



We cannot believe that this species possesses only six arms as 

 described b}' its author, as this would be too great a departure 

 from the arm structure of Crinoids generally'. It ma}' possibly 

 have had nine arms, with a single one in the anterior ray, but 

 more probably ten. Thus far but a single specimen has been dis- 

 covered, and in this onl}- the right posterior ray is perfectly' 

 visible, which had two arms ; the two adjoining rays are partly 

 hidden from view, while the remaining two are entirely imbeikled 

 in the matrix. There are traces of but five arms in the slab. We 

 judge from the photograph, PI. 14, fig. 1, that the arrangement of 

 the plates in the calyx has beeu somewhat disturbed, and this 

 explains the fact that in the diagram, p. 110, the basals (subradials 

 of Trautschold) and radials are incorrectly represented. It naa}-, 

 however, be possible that the original, like a specimen of P. bijugus 

 in our possession, for which we aie indebted to the kindness of 

 Prof. Trautschold, is abnormal, and that some of the basals (sub- 

 radials) are anchylosed with the adjoining radials, as in our 

 specimen. Until better material is found we must consider F. 

 originariua as a large and abnormal example of P. bijugu.^.

A. Typical form. 



In general aspect Graphiocinnus closely agrees with a form of 

 Po^e?■^ocr^n»s for which we have proposed the name Scyfalocrinus, 

 from which, however, it differs clearly in the anal area, which in 

 Graphiocrinus has but a single plate, wliile in the other it has 

 three. De Koninck, in his generic description, mentions only two 

 orders of plates as constituting the cah'x, in which he is evidently'" 

 mistaken. We have before us several species from the Burlington 

 limestone, which have heretofore been referred by their authors to 

 Scaphiocrinus^ but which agree in the clearest manner Aviih the 

 typical Graphiocrinifii encrinoides. They all, like the t^'pical spe- 

 cies, have ten arms — except an undescribed species, which we 

 think belongs to this type, and which has only five — constructed 

 of simple joints with parallel sutures; they have one large bra- 

 chial and a single anal plate, extending beyond the general limit 

 of the calyx; and whenever the column is attached there is no 

 trace of underbasals, j'et these plates are found in everj- one of 

 those species when seen with the column removed. We can no 

 longer doubt, from the evidence of our sj^ecimens, that the under- 

 basals, as suggested by Hall and Meek & Worthen, are also 

 present in the Belgian species, but hidden from view bj' the 

 column, and that all the al)ove-mentioned species belong to the 

 same genus. We therefore propose a revision of the generic 

 formula, protesting, however, against the assertion of the authors 




1«79.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 345 



last named, that the entire genus Scaphiocrinus as formulated by 

 Hall, IS Identical with Oraphiocrinus. Scaphiocrinus simplex 

 and a few other species like it with a single anal plate, are un- 

 doubtedly so, but all others, and by far the majority of species 

 descril)ed under Scaphiocrinus, are generically distinct from 

 Graphiocrinus, and must be classed with Foteriocrinus. 



Closely related to Oraphiocrinus are Bursacrinus, Meek & 

 Worthen, and Phialocrinus, Trautschold. We can perceive slight 

 structural differences by which the two might be distincruished 

 from the first, but it can only be a subgeneric division, and it is 

 somewhat questionable whether even this can be maintained as to 

 Phialocrinus. 



Revised Generic Diagnosis.— General form elonaate, almost 

 cylmdrical. Calyx small, rather shallow, with bilateral symmetry 

 Lnderbasals five, minute, rarely extending beyond the column 

 Basals small; four at least, frequently all five of them, equal. 

 The former is the case in all species in which the anal plate is 

 disconnected from the basals, the latter when it rests directly upon 

 one of them, in which case the posterior basal is considerably 

 higher and truncate above. Radials large, their upper articulating 

 margins straight. JJrachials one by five, as large or larger than 

 the radials, aud of a similar form, but with the lowe" marc^in 

 straight ; sutures gaping, articulating facet occupying the entire 

 width of the plate. 



There are generally two arms to each brachial, or ten to the 

 individual, which remain simple throughout; but in the above men- 

 tioned species the upper side of the brachials is truncate, and the 

 Crinoid has only five arms. The arms are long and heavy, com- " 

 posed of short joints with almost parallel sutures. Pinnula long. 

 A single rather small anal plate is placed half-way between the 

 radials and brachials, either resting on the posterior basal or 

 separated from it, but in either case extending above the plane of 

 the radials. Ventral sac, so far as observed, strong, composed 

 of elongate hexagonal plates. Column round or obtusely pen- 

 tagonal. 



Geological position, e(r:—Foxm(\ so far only in the Subcarboni- 

 ferous both of Europe and America. We recognize the following 

 species: — "^

Bod}' rapidly spreading to the top of the first division of the 

 arms. Calyx, in the known species, small and turbinate, closely 

 agreeing with Graphiocrinus iu its general construction, but the 

 basals comparatively larger, the posterior one much higher and 

 truncated. Radials and brachials smaller, and the single anal 

 plate, which here also reaches beyond the plane of the radials, ex- 

 tends — at least in the typical species — as far as to the lower portion 

 of the first arm plates. The best distinction, however, and that 

 by which Bursacrinus is easil}' recognized, is found in the arms, 

 which are branching instead of simple, broad, flat, and in contact 

 laterall3\ Between the first bifurcation of tlie rays on the brachial 

 pieces and the next division above, the arms are verj- wide, flat, 

 and composed of from six to eight short wedge-form pieces which 

 are squarely truncated on each side. In the division above, the 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 347 



arm pieces are less than half the width of the last, and like all 

 others composed of a single series of joints. 



In the extraordinary width of the lower portion of the arms, 

 the flatness of the arm pieces, and the fact that these lie side by 

 side, abutting laterally, Bursacrinus somewhat resembles Ichthyo- 

 crinu.^, but tlie arms are comparatively longer and the general 

 construction of the l)ody otherwise is very distinct. 



Only two species are known ; both are from the Subcarboniferous.

C. Subgenus (?) PHIALOCRINUS Trautsehold.' (Not Eichwald ) 

 1879. Monogr. Kalkbruche von Mjatschkowa, p. 122. 



Prof. Trautsehold proposed the above name in a full generic 

 sense for two species of Crinoids from the Upper Subcarboniferous 

 of Russia. The resemblance to Graphiocrinus, as already men- 

 tioned, is so close that we doubt whether the group can be 

 upheld even subgenerically. So far as known, Phialocrinus patens 

 diflfers from Graphiocrinus, as now revised, only in having two 

 brachial pieces instead of one, and in the underbasals, which here 

 project slightly beyond the column. The latter is unimportant, 

 and a comparison will show tiiat the two brachials combined have 

 exactly the form of the single plate in Graphiocrinas; their 

 division involves no structural change, but merely facilitates arti- 

 culation. Trautschold's first species only can be placed here; 

 his P. urna is certainly a Poterioerinus, as indicated by its ob- 

 conical form, the large underbasals, and especially by the arrange- 

 ment of its anal plates.

with near!}' straight sides, slightl}' concave in the middle. Basals 

 about of equal size, hexagonal, wider than high. Radials penta- 

 gonal, wide, and short, broadl}' truncate above. Bracliials one 

 by five, similar in form to the radials, but truncate below instead 

 of above; the}' support on each upper sloping side an arm which 

 bifurcates on the fourth to the eighth plate above, the branches 

 remaining simple throughout, thus giving four arms to each ray 

 uniformly. 



The arms are rather divergent, heavy, rounded on the outside, 

 gently tapering to the tips and terminating in a sharp point. 

 Arm pieces extremel}' short, their sutures parallel. Pinnulae long 

 and numerous, directed inward, composed of ten to twelve small 

 joints. 



The anal area is remarkable for its great number of pieces, 

 being composed longitudinally of several rows of plates, alter- 

 natel}' arranged. The lower and largest plate rests between two 

 basals, one of the upper sides against the right posterior ra- 

 dial, the other against the first anal of the adjoining row. The 

 second anal plate rests upon a basal, and abuts laterall}' against 

 the left posterior radial. The third anal is placed upon the first, 

 toward the right side of the second, and rests parti}' against the 

 right posterior radial. The anal area is elliptic in outline, com- 

 posed of twelve or more plates, only three of which are on a level 

 with the radials. The form of the ventral sac is unknown, but 

 from all appearances it is somewhat balloon-shaped, and does not 

 extend to the top of the arms. 



Column ratlier slender, composed of alternate wider and nar- 

 rower joints, their diameter increasing from the root up. being 

 largest next to the calyx; central perforation round. 



The genus is from the Subcarboniferous, and the only known 

 species is : —

General form of body with arms closed, terete or subcylindrical, 

 often contracted near the arm bases and spreading above; Calyx 

 more or less depressed, low cup or basin-shaped, °arely turbinate, 

 with the basal portion sunken in and forming a deep concavity. 

 Arrangement of plates slightly unsymmetrical. 



Underbasals five (abnormally six), small, generally hidden in 

 the central concavity, and covered by the column. Basals five, 

 sometimes nearly equal, but more frequently showing a tendency 

 to irregularity on the posterior side. Radials five, pentagonal, 

 the upper side truncate, with a single brachial plate in each of the 

 four lateral rays; the anterior ray, however, as a rule has one, 

 two, to six or more additional quadrangular brachials, and a bifur- 

 cating plate above, resembling in outline the single brachial of the 

 other rays. The latter plate is wide, rather shon, and of the form 

 of the radials, but truncate below, and joining the entire upper 

 margin of the radial. 



Ai-ms comparatively short, bifurcating, scarcely rounded on the 

 exterior, rarely angular; the bifurcating plates comparatively 

 larger and sometimes nodose. Ramifications only occur on the 

 two outer arms of the rays, and these arms have straight outer 

 margins throughout their length. The branches are given off' at 

 regular intervals toward the inner side of the ray, and remain 

 single throughout. The aims are all of uniform thickness, and 

 their sides are sharply defined, and when closed they join so 

 neatly with each other that it appears as if they formed a solid 

 body. Arm-joints much wider than fong, with nearly parallel 

 sutures. Pinnule short and slender, composed of six or more 

 angular joints directed to the interior of the crinoid, not given off 

 laterall}-. Arm furrows apparently covered by the infolding of 

 the pinnnlae, not by alternating plates. 



There are from five to seven anal plates, alternately arranged in 

 two rows, the lower plate resting with one side against the sloping 

 right side of the ))osterior basal, the other against the right pos^ 

 terior radial, in some species almost touching the underbasals. 

 The arrangement of the succeeding plates is very similar to that 

 of WoodofriniiH, except that the portion of the anal area above 

 the line of the radials has a sharp triangular outline instead of 




350 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [I8t9. 



elliptic as in that genus. The whole protrudes and is almost even 

 with the surface of the adjoining arms, wdiich curve around it or 

 rest upon its flanks. The ventral sac is broadly balloon-shaped, 

 and extends, so far as observed, to about one-half the height of the 

 arm. It is composed of a great number of small plates, is sub- 

 pyramidal, sharply pointed at its upper end. It consists of five 

 diverging spheromeres, the radial portions deeply depressed, the 

 interradial extending outward in sharp edges, the edge at the 

 posterior side connecting with the anal area, those of the other 

 sides abruptly turned near the top of the calyx toward the poste- 

 rior of the specimen, where the sac evidently connects with the 

 main body, thus resembling a balloon. The shar[) edges are 

 wedged in for a short distance between the outer arms of two dif- 

 ferent ra3's, and the arms themselves with their pinnulfe rest 

 within the radial excavations almost as in Eucalyptocrinus. The 

 radial spaces are subdivided near their base by a short ridge, 

 underneath which, and apparently independent of the sac, there is 

 seen in every ray a little short tube representing the ambulacral 

 passages. There is no sign of an anal opening, but we have ob- 

 served two rows of respiratory pores along the median line of the 

 radial depressions. 



Column round, sometimes bordered by irregular lateral cirrhi; 

 its diameter small, the central canal minute and apparently' round. 



The genus Zeacrinus is evidently closel}' related to Woodocri- 

 nus, and as we are inclined to believe that the ventral sac, which 

 has not yet been discovered in the latter, is most probablj^ simi- 

 larl}' constructed, we have felt almost like placing Zeacrinus 

 (which was defined as late as 1858 by Hall), under De Koninck's 

 genus as a subgenus. We have noticed, however, a difference in 

 the construction and habitus of the arms by which we think the 

 two ma}' be satisfactorily distinguished. Those of Woodocriniis, 

 as observed in a large number of specimens, show a strong inclina- 

 tion to separate b}- being more or less irregularly bent to one side, 

 particularl}' near the top; while in Zeacrinus they are closely 

 folded up, ver}' much as in Ichthyocrinus, and perfectly straight, 

 with quite a different mode of bifurcation. In the former they 

 are round, very robust, terminating in a sharp point; in the latter 

 almost flat, ver^- delicate, and of nearly uniform size throughout. 



The identification of Zeacrinus lias always been attended with 

 difficulty, owing to the fact that it had not been sufficient!}' well 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 351 



defined. The ventral sac, which really presents the best generic 

 characters, and by which it is easily recognized, was altogether 

 unknown, and the difficulty was increased when several species 

 were admitted which belong to other groups, and which were evi- 

 dently not intended to be included b}- the authors of the genus. 

 We have been obliged to throw out all species with long, angular, 

 zigzag arm-joints ; these have also a tubular ventral sac. and we 

 have placed them under some of the varieties of Foteriocrinus^ 

 where they really belong. 



Zeacrinus has bj' most authors been placed under Poteriocrinus 

 as a subgenus, but in this we cannot concur. We look upon it 

 rather as the t\'pe of an independent little group of Crinoids, in- 

 cluding several genera, which culminates in Hydreionoerinus and 

 Cceliocrinus^ some of the last survivors of the Cyathocrinidae. 



Zeacrinus excavatus Schultze is evidently a Taxocrinus. 



Geological position, etc. — The genus is confined to the Subcar- 

 boniferous, ranging through all the divisions of that epoch; and 

 has only been discovered in America.

A. Typical form. 



General form subcylindrical, short, slightly spreading toward 

 the tips of the arms; with an enormous ventral sac extending be- 

 yond the limits of the arms, and covering them like a roof. 

 Calyx short, rounded below, basal portion sometimes deeply 

 concave. 



Underbasals small, and, according to De Koninck, forming a 

 five-rayed star or shallow cup. In all known American species 

 the underbasals rest within a deep concavit}', and are scarcely 

 visible be3'ond the column ; but they appear to be considerably 

 larger on tlie interior of the cal^^x, sometimes almost exceeding 

 the basals in size. Basals five, three of them of equal size, and 

 hexagonal ; the two in contact witli the anal plates frequently 

 larger. Radials five, large, mnch wider than high, four of them 

 pentangular, that on the left posterior side quadrangular; tlie 

 former resting each between two adjacent basals, and the latter 

 abutting upon onl}- one. Bracliials one to the ray, or two in the 

 anterior ray, pentangular, as large or larger than the radials, often 

 produced into long spines ; in species where the anterior ray has 

 an additional brachial, the first is quadrangular, the second is 

 pentangular and bears the spine. The brachials meet laterally, and 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 353 



support on their upper sloping sides two arms, which subdivide 

 once, or oftener. 



The arms ramify in the same manner as in Zeac7^iniis,hy throw- 

 ing off brandies toward the inner side of the ra}' ; they touch 

 laterall}', and are so arranged that the sutures between tiie rays, 

 from the basals up, form straight lines, except on the posterior 

 side where the arms curve slightly, following the margin of the 

 anal area. The arms, before the}' become simple, are composed of 

 short, strongl}' wedge-shaped joints alternately arranged, which in 

 most species are by degrees turned into a double series of inter- 

 locking plates. Pinnulae very small and short. 



The arrangement of the anal plates is exactly as in Zeacrinus 

 and Woodocrinus^ but the anal area is less protuberant. The ven- 

 tral sac, which is the most remarkable part of this Crinoid, and 

 the best character for distinction, has the form of a mushroom) 

 upright, cylindrical below, abruptly spreading be3'ond the tips of 

 the arms and forming a rim composed of a row of 6, 11, 15 or 

 more large, spiniferous or nodose plates, spread out horizonally 

 and tending slightly downward. The upper part or roof is low 

 hemispherical, and is formed either by the spiniferous plates them- 

 selves, which are in that case unusually large, or more frequently 

 hy a number of irregular plates within the centre. The tid)e, or 

 cylindiical portion of the sac, is composed of small plates, hori- 

 zontall}' arranged, and provided at the sutures with one or two 

 rows of respiratory pores. No other aperture has as yet been ob- 

 served, nor has the connection of the tube with the main body 

 been ascertained. 



Column small. 



De Koninck, in his generic description, took the upper portion 

 of the ventral sac to be a regular vault, and thereby distinguished 

 this genus from Foteriocriniis with a large proboscis, while this 

 organ, as he supposed, was absent in Hydreionocrinus. Some of 

 the European species which De Koninck refers to his genus must 

 be considered doubtful until better proof is given that the}' belong 

 here. His H. globularis is, in our opinion, an Eupachtjcrinus. 



Hydreionofrinus has the closest relations with Zeacruvis^ with 

 which it agrees in the construction of the calyx, and in the mode 

 of bifurcation of tl«e arms; but the enormous size of the ventral 

 sac, its peculiar form and construction, seem to warrant a full 

 generic separation.

When Dr. Wliite proposed the genus Ccelioa^imts, he had evi- 

 dentl}' overlooked De Koninck's genus Hydreionocrinvs, witii 

 which it agrees in all essential points except in the form of the 

 ventral sac, which is balloon-shaped in Coeliocrinus, instead of 

 like a mushroom, and except also that in Hydreiovocrinus the 

 calyy is comparatively larger and the arms shorter. Whether these 

 di (Terences are of suflicient importance to justify even a sul (generic 

 division, is to us somewhat doubtful. The two forms are certainly 

 not generieally distinct, for they shade into one another so closely 

 that in some species it becomes difficult even to separate them on 

 the above characters. We, for our part, are inclined to recognize 

 in CcBliocrinus^ which occurs in the lower Subcarboniferous, the 

 earlier stage of Hydreionocrinus ; the latter, which flourished 

 during the later periods of the Carboniferous, both in Europe and 

 America, representing the culmination of the form in maturity 

 and extravagance, as developed in the course of time. Such ex- 

 traordinary development in certain parts of the animal — as here 

 in the ventral sac — frequentl}- occurs when a genus is about to 

 become extinct, and Hydreionocrinus is, in fact, one of the last 

 survivors of this famil3\ Bearing this in mind, it is of little 

 consequence whether we place the species of this group under 

 Hydreionocrinus, or subgcnerically under Coeliocrinus. 



The relations of this form with Zeacrinus are also very close 

 and interesting, and the question may well be asked whether all 

 three forms ought not to be placed under Woodocrinus, provided 

 this genus possesses an inflated sac, which we consider the most 

 ciiaracteristic feature of this little group; especially as they 

 further agree in the shortness of the arms and their peculiar mode 

 of bifurcation. Such a classification would certainlj- be more 

 natural than to place them under Poteriocrinus, as was done by 

 Hall, and subgcnerically by Meek and Worthen. All Poferio- 

 crini have long arms, and the ventral sac is prolonged into a 

 slender tube. The arms in all species of Coeliocrinus are com- 

 posed of strongly wedge-shaped plates, which almost interlock, as 

 they do completely in most species of Hydreionocrinus, while the 

 corresponding joints in Zeacrinus and Woodocrinus are regularly 

 quadrangular, with parallel sutures.

Meek and Worthen proposed tlie name Eupachycrinus^vf\t\\o\xl 

 generic description, for a small group of American Crlnoids, which, 

 by their massive, tumid plates, the double series of interlocking 

 plates generally composing the arms, and their general phj'siog- 

 nom3\ are well distinguished from all other known genera. Thej" 

 made Lyon's G raphiocrinus quatuor decimbrachialis the type of 

 the genus, including in it Hall's two species — Cyathocrinus (?) 

 pentalobus and Scaphiocrinus orbicularis, and have since described 

 several new species. 



In 1867 Prof. Trautschold, not knowing that such a genus had 

 been established, proposed the name Cromyocrinus for two 

 species from the Upper Subcarboniferous of Russia,^ which in 

 many respects, if not altogether, agree with those upon which 

 Eupachycrinus was founded. The species of both agree in the 

 bowl-shaped, sometimes nearly- globular form of the cah-x, its 

 comparatively very large size, its large and heavy plates, the 



' We are under obligations to Dr. Trautschold for some excellent Cri- 

 noids from the Russian beds, and to Prof. Wethcrby, of Cincinnati, for the 

 loan of some rare and well-preserved specimens of Eupachycrinus. 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 357 



massive and simple arms, and the exceeding!}' slender column. 

 A comparison, however, of all the species that have been referred 

 to the two genera discloses the peculiar fact, that some of them 

 disagree in certain other characters which we have heretofore, in 

 connection witli other groups, and apparently with good reason, 

 considered to be of generic value. Among these we may mention 

 the variation in the size of the proximal or underbasal plates, in 

 the number and arrangement of the anal pieces, and in tbe form 

 and arrangement of the arm plates; but to separate them thereby, 

 either under Cromyocriuus or olhevwise^hcis so far proved utterly 

 impossible. It is true that the underl>asals in all Russian species 

 referred to Cromyocrinus are exceptionally large, but only so in 

 the adult stage. , In the young specimens, as shown b}' Traut- 

 schold himself, the}' are so minute as not to extend beyond the 

 column, so that in making the size of these plates a generic char- 

 acter we should be obliged to separate the young and adult. 



There are, moreover, several American species wliich in all other 

 respects agree with the typical forms of Cromyof-rinus^ but in 

 which these plates, even in the adult, are exceedingly small. The 

 same difficulty is met with in regard to the anal area. In two 

 s[)ecies — Eupachycrinus Craigii Meek and Worthen, and E. 

 Fayettensiri Worthen — the anal area is composed of a single plate, 

 instead of three, and this even extends partly beyond the line of 

 the radials. That this is not an abnormity, but a constant 

 character in the species, is proved b}- a number of specimens. In 

 ever}' other group we should not hesitate to establish a new 

 genus on this cliaracter alone; but in this case we are convinced 

 that it is only of specific importance, since tiiose species agree in 

 all other respects with Meek and Worthen's typical Enpachy- 

 crinus. In one specimen of another species, in our collection, 

 only the larger, lower anal plate is absent, but this ma}' be con- 

 sidered as aljnormal, for the adjacent basal and radial plates show 

 a very irregular form. 



Examining the arms, we find them in two of the Russian species 

 of Cromyocrinus composed of narrow, transverse, quadrangular 

 plates; in C. orna^/.*"-, however, they are of cuneiform pieces which 

 by degrees become interlocking plates. The same diversity in 

 the structure of the arm plates is found among American species, 

 some interlocking almost from the base of the arm. others only 

 at the tips, while still others are constructed of a single series of 




358 PROOEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1879. 



transverse plates, with parallel sutures, as in the two species of 

 Cromyocrinus from Russia. We have an example in a specimen 

 from Kentucky, which we owe to the kindness of Prof. Wetherby, 

 evidently Eu2:)achyc7nnus formosus {Zeacrinns formosus Wortli.), 

 which in every other respect is so closely allied to EupacJiycrinus 

 spartarius S. A. Miller (which has two rows of alternating arm- 

 pieces), that the two cannot be separated unless the arms are 

 preserved; while, on the other hand, it is almost identical with 

 Trautschold's Cromyocrinus geminatus. This is sufficient to 

 show the impracticabilit}'^ of subdividing Eiipachyocrinus, and we 

 are forced to consider Cromyocrinus as a synonym. 



It is certainly pertinent to inquire how it is possible that the 

 same differences in the structure of these Crinoids are in some 

 cases of generic, and in others onl}' of si)ecific importance. We 

 think the question can be answered without much speculating. 

 In a paper, "Transition Forms in Crinoids," Proc. Acad. Xat. 

 Sci. Phila., 1878, p. '224, we have endeavored to prove that ex- 

 travagant forms are of short duration ; that many genera, before 

 they become extinct, attain extreme proportions or become extra- 

 ordinarily developed in certain parts of the bod3'. Such was the 

 case with Hydreionocrinus with regard to the ventral sac, which 

 was developed to its farthest extreme in size and proportions. In 

 Eupachycrinus the opposite extreme is reached, the same organ 

 being reduced to almost nothing, making it almost doubtful 

 whether the genus ought to be placed with the Cyalhocrinidce at 

 all; although we cannot, with our present knowledge, separate it 

 from this family. This form was one of its very latest repre- 

 sentatives, which eviflently struggled through under great diffi- 

 culties, and which by degrees accommodated itself to the great 

 changes which took place about the close of the Carboniferous 

 Age. All the peculiarities which are expx'essed in the genus, the 

 ditferentiations which distinguish the species, point toward and 

 foreshadow Encrinus. We observe this in the form and con- 

 struction of the calyx; in the number, size, and arrangement of 

 the arms; in the mode of articulation, and in the general aspect. 

 The two mainly differ in the absence of anal plates in Encrinus ; 

 but here again we find in the species of Eupachycrinus, to which 

 we alluded above and which are restricted to the Coal Measures, 

 the forerunners of Erisocrinus and Stemmatocrinus of the same 

 horizon, which are the proplietic types, if not congenera, of the 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 359 



Encrinidfe. All this tends to explain the extraordinar}' modi6ca- 

 tion of characters that took place within the limits of genera at 

 the close of the Carboniferous Era. 



Generic Diagnosis. — Calyx large, saucer or bowl-shaped to sub- 

 globose. Plates heavy, convex to tumid, sometimes ornamented, 

 their arrangement unsymmetrical; sutures strongly defined. 



Underbasals five, of equal size; generally small and forming a 

 concavity; in European species comparatively larger and slightly 

 convex. Basals large, fully as high as wide, bent upwards so that 

 the lower half of the plates stands almost at right angles to the 

 vertical axis, and forms a part of the basal plane, oris involved in 

 the concavity. Three of the basals are equal, pentagonal in out- 

 line; the other two modified to accommodate the anal pieces. 

 Radials scarcely as large as the basals, much wider than high, all 

 pentagonal, the right posterior plate being, however, generally 

 smaller and of a more irregular form. The upper articulating 

 margin of the plate forms a straight line, perfectl}' filled by the 

 brachials. Brachials one by five, always large, at least twice as 

 wide as high, and frequently extended into a large spine, project- 

 ing laterally. Their outer form is almost quadrangular, although 

 the}' are usually bifurcating plates. They abut laterally', closing 

 the interradial spaces (except at the anal side) by which they 

 appear as if a part of the cal^'x. 



There are generally two arras to each ray or ten to the in- 

 dividual ; sometimes onl}* five, as in Evpachycrinus simplex 

 Trautschold. The}' are strong, scarcely diminishing in size to 

 the extremities, and rounded on the outside. They are variously 

 constructed, either of a single or double series of plates, the 

 former being either short, transverse with straight lines, or cunei- 

 form, becoming by degrees alternately arranged and interlocking. 

 Ambulaeral groove wide and deep; I'innules short and heavy. 



Anal plates generally three, rarely one; succeeding plates form- 

 ing part of the small ventral tube. The lower anal plate is 

 largest, and sometimes attains, for a plate of this kind, unusual 

 dimensions; it is quadrangular in outline, and rests ol)liquely 

 between the posterior iiasal and right radial. The second plate, 

 which is next in size and also large, is placed between the first 

 anal and left railial,aiid above the basal. The third unal is much 

 swollen, and only the lower half of it is included in the cal3X. 

 All succeeding plates, which are alternately arranged, decrease in 




360 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACAKEMY OF [1879. 



size upward, and form so far as known a small ventral tube, whicli 

 lias been traced to the height of the fourth or fifth arm plate, 

 where it is composed of small, very delicate, hexagonal plates. 

 The anal plates and lower portion of the tube are slightly pro- 

 tuberant, and give to the calyx a somewhat unsymmetrical aspect. 

 In species with a single anal plate in the calyx, which, so far as 

 observed, are altogether confined to the upper Coal measures, the 

 plate is comparatively small, and rests upon the posterior basal 

 and between the adjoining radials. There can be no doubt that 

 this plate is the homologue of the second anal of other species, 

 with which it closely agrees in form and position ; and that the first 

 anal plate is here absent, while the third is included in the ven- 

 tral tube. 



Column round and small. 



The upper margin of the radials is provided with a rather 

 prominent, narrow, articulating process, occup^Mng the full width 

 of the plate, corresponding to a similar process opposite on the 

 succeeding brachial. A slit-like opening occupies the middle of 

 it to nearly one-third of its length, which penetrates the plates and 

 evidently contained the muscular apparatus. A similar structure 

 is observed between the brachial and the first arm plates. Such 

 linear processes were well adapted to facilitate the opening and 

 closing of the arms. We may further state that in all species the 

 lower portions of the brachials are pushed inward and the plates 

 incline outward, owing to the position of the hinge lines which 

 are close to the inner edge of the margin of the radial, and at the 

 outer edge of the brachial; the outer edge of the margin of the 

 radial is bevelled. By this structure, which gives to the Crlnoids 

 of this genus their peculiar subglobose form, the ponderous arms 

 obtained an important support; for when open, the tumid or spin- 

 iferous brachials rested firmly upon the protuberant radials, and 

 this explains fully the oflSce of the brachial spines in this and 

 all similar genera. A similar articulation exists between the 

 brachials and arm plates, and also here the sutures are widely 

 gaping. 



Geological posUio-n, etc. — The genus is known only from the 

 uppermost part of the Subcarboniferous and the Coal measures, 

 reaching its culmination in the hitter. It is found both in Europe 

 and America, from Utah to Central Russia.

A. Typical form. 



Comparing the Crinoidal fauna of our Western States and 

 territories, as we find it toward tlie close of the Carboniferous, 

 with that of the same' geological age in Central Russia, it is sur- 

 prising to find the same generic forms surviving in both countries. 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PrilLADELPrilA. 363 



This has been already- seen as to Poteriocrinus and Enpachy- 

 crinus, and will be still further proved in Slemmatorrinus, 

 which we consider to be the Russian representative of the 

 American genus J'Jj'if^orrinvs^ although we are ol)liged to separate 

 them subgenerically. Trautsehold describes his genus Slemmalo- 

 ci'inus with a single subbasal plate, while in Erisocrinus the 

 pelvis is distinctly divided into five pieces. We also observe a 

 difference in the construction of the arms, which in the former 

 are composed of a double series of interlocking plates, while in 

 the two species of Erisocrinus, in which the arms have been 

 found, tiie}' are com[)osed of single transverse plates. Both spe- 

 cies, however, are from the Burlington limestone, and are very 

 small, and it is extremely probable, from analogy with contempo- 

 raries, that the arms in the species from the Coal measures, where 

 the genus flourished more abundantly, were, as in Slemmatocri- 

 71US, composed of interlocking pieces, and that the Burlington 

 species represent the young form. This would make the ditler- 

 ence in the underbasals tlie only visible distinction. 



Meek & Worthen, after publishing the description of Erisocri- 

 nus, were led b}- its similarity to a genus described by De Koninck 

 under the name Philocrinus, from the Subcarboniferous locks of 

 India, to l)el!eve it identical therewith, and ranged their species 

 under it accordingly. Later comparisons, however, led them to 

 reconsider this. They assert that if Philocrinus has no subradial 

 plates, then the two genera are clearly distinct; but, if small 

 plates should be discovered within the plates now called basals, 

 they are probably identical. We have never seen specimens, nor 

 even De Koninck's description of Philocrinus, and are unable to 

 express an}- opinion in the matter. 



Generic Diagnosis. — Calj'x saucer- to cup-sliaped; symmetry 

 strictly equilateral. General aspect similar to that of the two 

 preceding genera. 



Underbasals ver}' small, forming a pentagonal, flattened, or con- 

 cave disc or low cup. Basals large, uniformly hexagonal. Badials 

 considerabl}- larger than the basals, pentagonal, much wider than 

 high, upper sides straight. There being no anals, the plates of 

 each order or of each successi^■e ring are of equal size and like 

 form, and alternate regular]}* with those of successive rows. Bra- 

 chials one by Ave, similar in form to the radials, but the lower 

 margins are straight and the upper obtusel}' angular fen- the sup-

port of the arms. The brachials abut laterally, leaving no space 

 for interraclial or anal plates ; the hinge line constructed as in 

 Eupachycrinus. 



Arras two to each ra}', strong, and, so far as yet observed, com- 

 posed of a single series of transversel}' oblong pieces. 



Column round or obscurely pentagonal. 



Geological jjosition, etc. — The tyi)ical form of this genus has 

 been found only in America, where it is restricted to the Burling- 

 ton limestone and Coal measures. The two Burlington species 

 are among the rarest Crinoids of that locality, and in the Coal 

 measures perfect calyces are rare, though fragmentary' pieces have 

 been found in some localities in great abundance. .

Underbasals represented b}- a flat disc, which is undivided, 

 reo-ularlv pentagonal, and extending considerably bej'ond the pe-

 upward, the lower portion included in the truncate surface, the 

 upper almost vertical. Radials pentangular, twice as wide as 

 high, articulating lines straight and extending the full width of 

 the plate. Brachials one by five, pentagonal, of similar form with 

 the radials; the upper margin obtusel}- angular, its sloping sides 

 excavated to receive the arms. 



First arm plate simple, comparatively large, lower face rounded.

It is succeeded 1)\' two rows of regular interlocking plates. The 

 arms are very heavy, rounded on the outside, continuing of the 

 same size to near the top, wliere the\' taper to a sharp point. The 

 articulation between the radial and brachial plates is on the same 

 princi[)le as in Eupachycrinus. There is a narrow single line 

 across the entire width of the plate, and the outer edges of both 

 plates adjoining it are so strongly bevelled in the typical species, 

 that if the arms were open, nearly one-half of the brachials would 

 rest upon, and be supported b}- the sloping face of the radials. 

 Column round. 



The total absence of anal plates in this and the pi'eceding sec- 

 tion of the genus, distinguishes it readily from an}- other of tiiis 

 famil}', but at the same time raises a reasonable doubt whether 

 Erisocrinus and Stemmatocrinus possessed a solid ventral append- 

 age, and, therefore, whether tliey belong to the C^alhocrinidre, or 

 even to the Palteocrinoidea. We have, so far, no knowledge what- 

 ever of the construction of the actinal or oral side of the body; 

 ■whetlier it had an open mouth or was firmly closed by plates or 

 scaly integument; and if it had not been for their marked resem- 

 blance to Eupachycrinus in which a ventral tube has been ob- 

 served, and that both were representatives of the same geological 

 age, living under the very same conditions, we should have felt 

 strong!}- disposed to place the whole genus with Encrmus, with 

 which it has, indeed, both in body and arms, the closest affinities. 

 That Erisocrinus and Stemmatocrinus have onl}- one brachial, 

 and Encrinus two, is not material, and is, at the most, onl}- of 

 generic importance; but in Encrinus the aboral side of the bod}-, 

 or the plates which in all Cyathocrinidre constitute tiie calj-x, form 

 almost a flat disc — at least do not extend beyond the basal plane 

 — and this is the onh' important distinction which can be dis- 

 covered between the two forms in the fossil state. This, how- 

 ever, may involve important structural modification in the internal 

 anatom}' of the animal, and probably shut out Encrinus entirely 

 from the Palreocrinoidea. 



Geological Position, etc. — Sfemmatocri7ius is only known from 

 the limestone beds of Mjatschkowa, where Prof Trautschold dis- 

 covered the only species.

We place the genus Eusinrocrinus by itself, as it differs from 

 all other C^athocrinidie in its peculiar arm structure, in which it* 

 somewhat resembles Edriocrinus Hall, and the recent genus Holo- 

 pus D'Orb. It also diflTers in the construction of the ventral sac, 

 which appears like the proboscis of the Actinocrinidffi, except that 

 in Euspiocrinus the inner cavit}^ is large. Pores have not been 

 observed.

 1859. Ibid., Decade iv. p. 30. 



Carabocrinus and the three following genera are imperfectly 

 known, and placed here Avith some doubt; better specimens must 

 be discovered before it can be decided whether they are good 

 genera. 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 367 



Carabocrinus, in our opinion, is founded upon a malformed or 

 recuperated CyathocrinuK. A comparison of the two genera will 

 show that on the anterior side theA- are perfectl}' identical; they 

 also ngree most remarkably in the form of the cal3-x, the construc- 

 tion of the oral side, tlie delicacy of the arms, and their mode of 

 branching. The only difference is said to be in the construction 

 of the anal area, which, according to Billings, is composed of 

 three plates, the lower one resting upon the underbasals, which is 

 in itself an anomaly such as is found in no other genus. But, 

 further, if Billings's interpretation of the plates in question be 

 correct, the anal area in Garahocrinus would be directed toward 

 the left side of the specimen, which would be the only excei)tion 

 among the Palteocrinoidea, and there exists in no other group of 

 them a basal (subradial of Billings) which is neither radial nor 

 interradial, and which is disconnected from the radials, as would 

 be the case in this genus. (See Billings's Diagram, Dec. iv. p. 30, 

 and pi. 2, fig. 3 c.) In this specimen, which is the only example 

 in which the anal area has been observed, the small and abnormal 

 so-called subradial and the two anal plates of Billings combined, 

 have almost the form of one of the other basals (subradials) and 

 are but slightly larger, and we think that in the specimen the}'' 

 originally formed a single plate, which was accidental!}' broken 

 during the life of the animal and afterwards recuperated, leaving 

 marks of fracture which Billings took to be sutures between the 

 plates. Similar cases are frequentl}' met with among fossil cri- 

 noids, plates being sometimes broken into a dozen or more pieces, 

 which afterwards reunite, each piece retaining the appearance of 

 a true plate.

23. 0) CYRTIDOCRINTIS Angelin. 

 1878. Iconogr. Crin. Suec, p. 20. 



This genus is not only very imperfcctlj' known — a single calyx 

 onl}' having been thus far discovered — but it also deviates so 

 materially from all other C3^athocrinidjfi, that we doubt whether 

 it can be properly classed witli that famil}". According to Angelin 

 it has four underbasals, which are small and unequal in size. 

 Basals five, pentagonal or hexagonal. A single anal plate is inter- 

 calated between two basals and two radials. Kadials five-sided, 

 oblique, cl}' peiform.

24. (?) PACHYOCRINUS Billings. 

 1859. Geo]. Surv. Canada, Dec. iv. p. 22. (Not Pachycrinus Eichwald.) 



In the single specimen to which Billings applied the above name, 

 there are five pentagonal plates concealed Avitliin the cavil}' for 

 the attachment of the column, and above and alternating with 

 them five very large, thick plates, which may be either basals or 

 radials. The lower portions of these plates are bent under the 

 bod}', so as to constitute a broad, rounded, or concave bottom to 

 the cup, which has a width of nine lines at a height of two. At 

 this level tlie cup is broken off in the specimen.

 1878. Angelui, Iconogr. Crin. Suec. p. 11. 



{Herpetocrinus Salter, 1873, Cab. Mas. Camb., p. 118 is synony- 

 mous with Myelodactyhos, according to Angelin. ) 



Hall proposed the above generic name to characterize some 

 most remarkable fragments, apparently arm pieces of Crinoids, in 

 which, according to his description, " the foramen or medullur}' 

 canal penetrates the column of joints." No other portion of the 

 animal was known to him. 



Angelin, for reasons unknown to us, referred to this genus 

 three species, and gave the following generic descriptions, " Gene- 

 ral form of tlie body narrow, elongate ; cal^'x cup-shaped. Basals 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 3G9 



three; parabasals five, polygonal. Primar\' radials one, forming 

 a single zone; secondary radials in two series, the upper ones 

 triangular and arm bearing. Interradlals (probabl}' anals) two. 

 Arms long, threadlike, dicliotoraizing several times, composed of 

 single joints. Ventral tube distinct, articulated. Column strong, 

 convoluted, composed of thin joints with numerous articulated 

 cirrhi." He places this genus under his division '^Trimera" 

 (along with Taxocrinus and (rissocrmus), among the TaxocrinidfE. 

 Comparing Angelin's figures, we find that onl}' liis 31. hetero- 

 crinus agrees with the description. His M. gracilis lias five 

 primary radials, or, as we should say, four brachials ; his 31. (?) 

 inter radial is three to four, and, contrary to the rule in all Cjatho- 

 crinidce, a number of interradial plates. None of the species, 

 however, exhibit the peculiar arm structure upon which Hall 

 founded the genus; but, on the contrar3^, the two first-named 

 species at least seem to be devoid of pinnulae. Angelin figures — pi. 

 10, fig. 25 — an isolated convoluted column with numerous cirrhi, 

 which is said to belong to 31. gracilis, awd it seems that the super- 

 ficial resemblance of tliis column to the so-called arms of 3Iyelo- 

 daclylus induced Angelin to adopt Hall's name lor his species. 

 We cannot see any propriety in founding genera or species upon 

 mere fragments of arms or column, especially in a case like this, 

 where we are b^- no means satisfied tliat Hall's figure represents 

 the column, but rather believe, with him, that the}' are most prob- 

 ably portions of arms. We have here placed 31yelodactylus pro- 

 visionally under the Cyathocrinidre, because Anuelin's first two 

 species undoubtedly belong to that family, though probabl}' to 

 different genera. His 31. (?) interradialis^ however, is a repre- 

 sentative of an altogether different family. The}' all differ from 

 the Ichthyocrinidic in the large underbasals, in the free plates 

 above tiie first radials, the threadlike arms, and the general physi- 

 ognomy. So far as we know, the species agree with no established 

 genus, but the figures without descriptions are not sufficient for 

 us to found new genera upon.

pitulated. But I carelessly overlooked the patent fact that the 

 late George Gardner had published, in 184G, a Lialria {Leplo- 

 clinium) BraHilienHi^^ which he supposed to be a relative of Xut- 

 tall's LiaAris (Lejjtoclinium) fridicosa^ and that Bentham, in the 

 Genera Plantaruni, in view of the pentangular achenium of the 

 Brazilian plant and other characters, founded a genus upon it, and 

 unhappily gave it the name of Leptoclivuim. All this I unac- 

 countaljl}' overlooked. Now, although the name Leptoclinium 

 ought properly to belong to the North American i)lant, a sub- 

 generic name has no rights as against a published generic name. 

 Ho a new name must be provided for the Florida plant. I had 

 thought at the first of dedicating it to Dr. Garber, but I deferred 

 to the snbgeneric name given alread}- by Xuttall; and I now do 

 with alacrity what I ought to have done in the first place. The

KEPLY TO DE. M. C. COOKE'S CRITICISM OF PAPER ON "VARIABILITY 

 OF SPHiERIA QTJERCTJTJM, SZ." 



BY. J. B. ELLIS. 



In the last numher of Grevillia the editor of that Journal makes 

 some statements with regard to nn- paper on Sphseria Quercuum^ 

 published in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences 

 of Philadelphia last March, which need correction. He says " It 

 matters not that the sporidia vary in size and form, that in some 

 (of the species) they should be obtuse, in others rather acute at 

 the extremities, in some hyaline, in others deep brown." Dr. 

 Cooke, who has examined the specimens, must have known that 

 these various forms of sporidia instead of being characteristic of 

 different species are all to be found in the same perithecium, the 

 narrow and acute forms being in fact onl}' young or imperfect. As 

 to the sporidia being "lualine in some and in others deep brown," 

 the record in Grevillea contradicts that statement, so far at least 

 as the species of C. and E. are concerned, Melogramma Aceris 2i\onQ 

 excepted; and even in tliis species mv specimens have the sporidia 

 hyaline. S. eriodiga is also said to have the sporidia brown and 

 biseptate; but it is added that these were free spores, the sporidia 

 actuall}' observed in the asci being h3-aline. In ni}- previous paper 

 I stated, and subsequent observation has confirmed the statement, 

 that brown biseptate spores are found in all the different forms 

 but as 3et not in asci. They occur but sparingly it is true, but a 

 careful and patient search is sure to reveal their presence. I wish 

 here to amend m^- original statement so far as the color of the 

 sporidia is concerned. In all fresh specimens examined, the spo- 

 ridia are h^-aline. Some specimens on Quenus alba and on Vac- 

 cinium Peyvisylvanicum, both of which had been poisoned, have 

 brown sporidia, but as the color may be due to the action of the 

 poison, it will be safer to assume that the sporidia are liyaline till 

 the examination of fresh and living specimens shall show them to 

 be brown. 



It is asked whj- twenty other species having similar sporidia 

 were excluded from the list? Simpl}' because I had not actually 

 examined specimens of these species, and it was not intended to 

 give mere opinion, but to state facts actually observed. As to 




382 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1879. 



''ignoring all variations of internal structure" and ''discarding 

 all external features," I am willing to let the specimens speak for 

 themselves^ 



• I intended to add to the original paper a foot note, designating all the 

 forms with perithecia not united in a stroma as vai'. simplex, but as no 

 additions could be made after the article was in t3'pe, I was obliged to con- 

 tent myself with adding this note with pen and ink to the copies sent me ' 

 for distribution.

ON A COLLECTION OF CRUSTACEA FROM VIRGINIA. NORTH CAROLINA, 

 AND FLORIDA, WITH A REVISION OF THE GENERA OF CRANGONID^ 

 AND PALa;MONID^. 



BY J. S. KINGSLEY. 



The specimens enumerated below were collected, with a few 

 exceptions, by Prof. IT. E. Webster, of Union College, at Nortli- 

 ampton County, Virginia (eastern shore, Atlantic side), beach of 

 Chesapeake Bay, opposite Fort Monroe, Ya., in the vicinity of 

 Beaufort, N. C, and ^Slarcou Pass, Florida Bay, Harbor Ke3', 

 Plantation Ke}', and Key West, Southern Florida, and Oyster 

 Bay, Charlotte Harbor, Sarasota Bay and Little Sarasota Bay, 

 on tiie west coast of Florida. I have endeavored to indicate to 

 a certain extent the geographical distribution of the species by 

 giving, in most instances, a list of localities from which specimens 

 have been reported, with the authority for the statement. In cases 

 where I have personally examined specimens, I have placed an 

 exclamation mark (I) after the localit}- followed by the name of 

 the collector. The arrangement followed in the Maioidea is that 

 of Miers (Jour. Linn. Soc'y, xiv. pp. 634-613, 1879). In the re- 

 maining groups of the Bracliyura, mainl}' that of Dana, the Ano- 

 nnira, according to Stimpson (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia, 

 1858, pp. 225-238), while the order of the Macrura is essentiall}' 

 tliat of Dana. A short notice of some of the new forms will be 

 found in the American Naturalist, vol. xiii. p. 584, September, 

 1879.

Five speGimens were collected at Sarasota Bay, Fla. This 

 species has quite an extended range in the tropics. Stimpson 

 reports it from the Florida Reefs and Madeira Is.; von Martens 

 from Cuba; Guadeloupe (Latr., Martens, and Desbonne), Gulf of 

 Mexico and Antilles (Ed\v. and Gibbes), Canar3' Is. (Brulld), 

 Cayenne and Bahia, Brazil (A. M. Edw.). Alphonse Milne Ed- 

 wards maintains the identity of LepUxpodia debilis Smith' with 

 this species. If it prove identical, the following localities on the 

 west coast of America will have to be added to the list: Valpa- 

 raiso (Bell, Edw,, and Lucas), Panama (Smith), Realijo, west 

 coast of Nicaragua! (McNiel). 



I find among the Guerin collection in the Museum of the Academy 

 of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, a specimen labelled '''Lep- 

 topodia vittata Guer., Senegal." I have not been able to find any 

 description of this species under that name, and possibly it was a 

 MS. one. However I am unable to separate it from Floridan forms.

 typical forms. The teeth of the antero-lateral margin are variable, 

 and differ frequently' on the two sides of the same specimen. A 

 3^oung specimen from Sarasota Bay had but four teeth on the

' The generic name Othonia was used by Johnston (Loudon's Magazine

 has been followed by no other author, with the exception of Gosse, and as 

 his single species has been assigned to the genus Amphicora, I refrain from 

 proposing a new name for Bell's genus.

 A careful examination of a large series has led me to unite these 

 two forms, as I cannot find constant differences to separate them. 

 There is all variation in the subhepatie tubercle, from one as 

 prominent as typical specimens of P. herhstii to complete absence; 

 the form of the anterolateral teeth varies, while the terminal seg- 

 ment of the male abdomen is the same in each form; in some the 

 fingers of both hands were slender, some had them pointed on one 

 hand and excavate on the other, while others iiad the fingers of 

 both hands excavate. I am the more ready to unite them since 

 Prof. Smith suggests their possible identity.

 specimen varying most widely from Stimpson's type. 



Carapax transversely oval, very broad, smooth, naked; antero- 

 lateral margin almost entire, the" three last teeth alone showing, 

 and they but very sliglitly. . Front sinuate, four lobed, resembling 

 that of Fanopeus herbstii, a straight fringe of hairs above the 

 margin. Orbits entire above and below, the inner inferior angle 

 prominent. Chelipeds long, about equal in length, but differing 

 greatly in diameter, the right being usually the larger. Fingers 

 of the larger about half the length of the palm, short, stout, 

 gai)ing, with the extremities acute, not at all excavate. Smaller 

 eheliped, with the carpus and propodus polished and deeply punc- 

 tate. Hand long, no stouter than the preceding joint, subcylin- 

 drical, fingers about half as long as the palm, closing completely,

Genus HETERACT.ffiA Lockington.' 



In the two species which I have examined the following charac- 

 ters may be noted. Form similar to that of Pilumnus, which it 

 closely resembles in the antennae and external maxillipeds. It, 

 however, differs in the absence of a palatal ridge and in the curious 

 naked crests on the meral joints of the ambulatory feet. The 

 orbits have the external hiatus more or less distinct, and below 

 have two lobes. It forms one of these synthetic forms, which 

 like XanthodiuSy Eurytium, Eurycarcinus, Pilumnopeus, Micro- 

 panope, etc., combine the characters of both Cancroid and Eriphioid 

 Crustacea. The type is Heteractsea lunata."^

sembling L. cariosa in form. Inner portions of branchial and car- 

 diac regions moderately protuberant. Hepatic region but slightly 

 excavate, the ridge crossing it being broad, low, and rounded, 

 otherwise as in L. cariosa. Front elevated, and connected with 

 cardiac region by a broad rounded ridge (in cariosa this ridge is 

 narrow and more abrupt) ; a small tooth on the postero-lateral 

 margin. The sulcus separating the cardiac from the branchial re- 

 gion is well marked, but not so much as in cariosa. Chelipeds 

 with small tubercles. Abdomen of the male with a strong tooth 

 directed backward, arising from the proximal margin of the penult 

 joint. 



A male from Sarasota Bay gives the following measurements: 

 Length of carapax 9.7 mm., breadth 11.1 mm., ratio 100 : 135. 



This species differs from cariosa in the broader carapax, the 

 ornamentation, and more even surface ; from j^ontifera in lacking 

 the " bridged" fossae between the cardiac and brachial regions ; 

 from cadaveroso, in more even carapax and ornamentation, and in

I am inclined to follow Stimpsou in supposing that tliis is not 

 the Porcellana galathina of Bosc, as it differs considerably from 

 his figure, which represents a species with smaller hands, shorter 

 fingers, the ridges of the carapax different, while the carapax itself 

 is nothing like that of this species. This species has been re- 

 ported from Georgia and Florida (Say), South Carolina and Key

 I refer, with a doubt, a single specimen collected at Key West 

 to this species, as it presents the following points of difference 

 from Dr. Streets' description: The lobes of the front are indis- 

 tinct. (The right hand is missing.) The posterior border of the 

 hand is not pubescent, and there is no trace of a furrow on the 

 upper portion of the hand; the anterior margin of the carpus 

 has four teeth. In every other respect it agrees perfectly. Dr. 

 Streets' specimens came from the Island of St. Martins, W. I.

Genus PISOSOMA Stm. 

 Pisosoma glabra, sp. n. Plate xiv. fig. 2. 



Carapax convex, a little broader than long, polished, microsco- 

 pically punctate. Front advanced, broad, three lobed, the median 

 lobe being slightly more advanced than the lateral ones. Anten- 

 njE about twice as long as the carapax, the basal joints similar to 

 those of Fetrolisthes. Chelipeds short, stout; meros subcubical, 

 its anterior margin distally armed with an acute tooth directed 

 toward the carpus ; carpus stout, broader than long, its anterior 

 margin expanded, with a strong tooth on the proximal portion, 

 the remainder with rounded teeth, the posterior portion of the 

 upper surface is roughened, and the posterior margin distally 

 armed with minute ronnded teeth. Hand twice as long as broad, 

 microscopically granulate, a shallow sulcus on the posterior por- 

 tion of the palm producing a cristate appearance of the posterior 

 margin ; fingers not so long as palm, completely closing, the dac- 

 tylus with a shallow groove above. Beneath, the chelipeds are 

 smooth and polished. Ambulatory feet sub-cylindrical, hairy 

 above. This species differs from Stimpson's description of his 

 imperfect specimen of P. riisei in the simple, not bimarginate 

 character of the front, etc. 



Five specimens were collected at Key West.

At my request Mr. Edward J. Miers very kindly examined 

 Leach's type in the British Museum, which was sent b}- Sa}- un-

 mens of Forcellana (Fisidia) sagana are certainl}^ not referable 

 to F. sexsjnnosa, as described by Gibbes, but appear to'belong to 

 F. ocellata of the same author. They agree well with Gibbes' de- 

 scription and with specimens of F. ocellata received by the British 

 Museum from the Smithsonian Institution, differing onl}' in be- 

 ing of smaller size and in no longer presenting any traces of the

Professor Webster obtained specimens of this curious crusta-

 Fla., from which the following description is drawn : — 



Carapax nearly cylindrical, the sides but slightl}^ arcuate ; sur- 

 face even, with minute transverse striae, which curve forward on 

 the sides. Front, between the eyes, about one-third the width of 

 carapax, three toothed, median tooth longer and projecting further 

 than the laterals. There is a slight excavation of the anterior 

 margin over the eyes and antennae. A minute acute spine at the 

 antero-lateral angle, and a little posterior to this is a slight emar- 

 gination of the lateral margin. E^-es minute, but little prominent. 



Antennal flagella about three-fourths the length of the carapax. 

 Feet stout; chelipeds stout; hands slightly roughened, fingers 

 about as long as the palm, not gaping; second pair shorter than 

 the third and fourth ; fifth pair small, and curved in the same

 cases from giving the synonymy of the species collected by Prof- 

 Webster.

 last being the farthest north from which the species lias been 

 reported. 



Alpheus packardii, sp. n. Front, antennulje and antennre as in 

 A. heterochelis except that the sulci between the base of the rostrum, 

 and the ocular hoods are deeper, and last joint of antennular pedun- 

 cle longer than in that species. External maxillipeds short, not 

 reaching to the tip of antennal scale. Chelipeds unequal, meros 

 with an acute tooth on the upper distal angle ; larger hand strongly 

 compressed, with a sharp tooth above near the articulation of the 

 dactylus, beyond this the hand becomes narrower by means of a 

 sharp bend of the inferior margin, dactylus contorted, and working 

 at an angle of about 30^ with the plane of the hand. Smaller hand 

 more slender, but similarly ornamented and armed, the dactylus, 

 however, being spatulate, working vertically, and with its margins 

 and those of the opposing thumij densely fringed with hairs. Cai*-

pus of the second pair with the first two joints equal, and each as 

 long as the third and fourth together, which, in turn, are subequal, 

 and each slightly shorter than the fifth joint. This species, in a 

 s^'stematic arrangement of the North American forms, would stand 

 between A. heterochelis and A. transversodactylus, but more nearly 

 to the former. The differences from that species are not easy to 

 describe, but are well marked in the specimens.

Having but a single specimen, and that in poor condition, I 

 have not been able to study it as thoroughly as I could wish. It 

 agrees, as far as I have been able to examine it, with Stimpson's 

 diagnosis of the genus except in the following particulars. The 

 carapax is not cristate, and has a minute rostrum; the antennal 

 flagella are much longer than in the type species; the mandibles, 

 as the specimen is unique, I have not been able to examine. It is 

 the second species of the genus known, and is interesting on ac-

 legs nearly as in Anchistia; tarsi of last three pairs of legs nearly 

 straight, acute." Type E. wrzesnowski Miers. 



I am uncertain as to the exact position of this genus, as the 

 author says nothing concerning the mandibles. There also exist 

 several discrepancies between the description and figures (Plate 

 Ixvii. f. 2-2 a). The spine on the anterior margin being repre- 

 sented as external to the eyes, and the first pair of feet being the 

 larger, which, if true, would remove it to the Alpheinae, from all 

 geneia of which, however, it is separated by the triflagellate an- 

 tennul*. Miers compares it with Anchistia and Harpilius^ and 

 in that locality I allow it to remain.

 Chas. K. Mills had latel}'^ observed, while examining the brain of 

 a white person, that the central fissure ran completeh' into the 

 fossa Sylvii witliont any bridging convolution being found present. 

 The fissura centralis, as it exists in the higher primates, begins at 

 the upper border of the hemisphere, and extends obliquely down- 

 wards and forwards, terminating above the S3'lvian, so that we 

 find an arched convolution surrounding its lower end and com- 

 pletel}' separating it from the Sylvian fissure. In 18fi6, however, 

 Turner reported a case (Edinburgh Medical Journal, 1 866) in which 

 he found this fissure joining the Sylvian. This appears to be, up 

 to that time, the only recorded case. Ecker, in speaking of this 

 observation (Cerebral Convolutions of Man, trans, by R. T. Edes, 

 M.D., 1873), says: "I have not yet seen a complete opening of 

 the central furrow into the fissura Sylvii of which Turner speaks;" 

 and Bischoff goes so far as to affirm (Die Grosshirnwiudungen des 

 Menschen, etc., Abhand. der k. bair. Akad. der Wissensehaften 

 Miinchen, 1868), tiiat the central fissure bends with its upper end 

 gradually' backwards, but it remains closed at its upper and lower 

 end. and never opens into the fossa Sylvii. In the Proc. of Acail- 

 emy of Nat. Sciences Phila., 1878, Dr. Parker has rejjorted a case 

 similar to those observed by Prof. Turner and Dr. Mills, a photo- 

 graph of which was exhibited ; so that we have now at least three 

 well-authenticated cases in which this relation of the two fissures 

 referred to above existed. Bischoff objects to the observation of 

 Turner on account of its disagreement with certain views in re- 

 gard to the morphology of the cerebral convolutions which he ad- 

 vances in the paper referred to above. He considers that "a hirge 

 number of the convolutions of the great hemisphere are arranged 

 around the ends of the primary furrows in more or less simple or 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 429 



complicated arches." The priinar}- fissures, according to him. are 

 the anterior and posterior Ijranches of the fossa Sylvii; tiie fissura 

 centralis or fis.siire of Rolando, fi.ssura perpendicularis interna or 

 parieto-oceipital fissure, fissura parallela or superior temporal 

 fissure, ami the fissura hippocampi. This latter fissure of Bischoff 

 corresponds to Gratiolet's fissure des hippocampes, and includes 

 both the fissura hii)pocampi and the fissura calrarina of otiier 

 writers. The type is expressed, according to Bischoff, by tliese 

 fissures, and the development of the convolutions consists merely 

 of arched windings surrounding the ends of these primary- fur- 

 rows, and the further development of the convolutions arises in 

 fact througii the stronger development, bending backwards and 

 forwards, rising and sinking of the lobules around the above-named 

 furrows. Through this process there arise secondary f(;lds and 

 fissures, side convolutions and connections and separations of in- 

 dividual convolutions Tlie same, says Bischoff, may be different 

 on the two sides of the same brain and in different individuals, 

 the ground forms being, therefore, more or less hidden, but we 

 can recognize them easily in all brains. He hopes, however, that 

 it will soon be i)0ssible to explain and make intelligible these in- 

 dividual modifications. There are, however, convolutions which, 

 as Bischoff remarks, do not ajipear to be in unison with this type, 

 such as the first and second frontal and the convolutions of the 

 occipital and temporal loI)es. For tliese Bischott'says that he can 

 find no particular plan on which they ma}- be basecl. They arise 

 one after tiie other, and become more and more complex, as it 

 appears, from purely mechanical necessities of the surface increas- 

 ing in a definite space. In tnis manner arise tiie first and second 

 frontal fissures, the second temporal, fissura collateralis. etc., and 

 their bordering convolutions. Thus, in the frontal lobe, Bischoff 

 points out two upper frontal convolutions, and ti third or inferior 

 arching around the ascending brancli of the fossa Sylvii. In the 

 frontal lolie an anterior and a i)osterior central winding arching 

 around the upper and lower extremities of tlie fissura centralis. 

 Posterior to these, at the upper border of the hemisphere and ex- 

 tending over on to the mesial surface, a superior internal parietal 

 erf)Up of convolutions (obere innere Scheitelgruppe) correspond- 

 ing to the lobulus parietalis superior and piiecuneus. Besides 

 these, Bischoff points out five so-called arched parietal convolu- 

 tions. A first or anterior i)ariclal arched conv<»lution (erste oder 

 vonlere Scheitelbogenwinduiig) surroumling the upper extremity 

 of the horizontal branch of the fossa Sylvii. A second or middle 

 (zweite oder mittlere Scheitelliogenwindung) surrounding the up- 

 per extrennly of the superior temjioral fissure. Posterior to these 

 a third smaller arched c«»Mvolution which curves around the upper 

 end of the fissura temjioralis media, the dritte Scheitelbogenwin- 

 dung. He admits, inileed, that the arrangement of these arched 

 convolutions is very variable and manifold, and therefore the 




430 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



appearance of these arches is not always easily discerned. He also 

 distinguislies a superior internal (obere iniiere oder vierte Scheitel- 

 bogenwin(iung) surrounding the upper extremity oftlie fissura per- 

 pendicularis interna. Tliis corresponds with the pli de passage 

 sup^rieur externe, Gratiolet, gyrus occipitalis prinnus, Ecker ; 

 oberer Zug der hintern Centrahvindung (in part), Iluschke ; erste 

 obere Hinterlappenwindung, Wagner, first external annectent gy- 

 rus, Huxley; first l)ridging annectent or connecting gyrus, Turner. 

 An inferior internal (untere innere oder fiinfte, Sclieitelbogenwin- 

 dung) surrounding the lower extremity of the fissura i)erpendicu- 

 laris interna. Tliis corresponds with the pli de passage interne 

 inferieur of Gratiolet ; gyrus cunei of Ecker. Tiie existence of a 

 pli de passage interne superieur is not admitted l)y Bischorf", who 

 considers that this convolution is homologous witli the pli de pas- 

 sage superieur externe. Ecker dissents from this view of tlie 

 case, and the speaker had attempted to siiow in a previous com- 

 munication (Plis de passage in the Primates, Proc Acad. Xat. 

 Sciences, Philadelpliia, 1878) that at least in certain cases Bischoff 

 is correct. In the occipital lobe BischofT distinguishes three con- 

 volution groui)s, an outer up[)er, the so-called cunus, and two 

 lower, an internal superior (lobulus lingualis), and an external in- 

 ferior (lobulus fusiformis). In the temporal lobe Bischoff does 

 not ditler in his divisions from previous writers. 



The observations referred to at the beginning of this communi- 

 cation in reference to the union of the central and Sylvian fissures 

 is not in accordance with the views of Bischoff, at least in the ab- 

 solute manner in which he proposes them ; and that he considers 

 the presence of these arching convolutions around the ends of the 

 primary furrows as absolutely essential, is shown b}' hi.-? criticism 

 of Turner's observation referred to above, and also of Dr. Rol- 

 lesion's observations on tlie premier pli de passage. In seven 

 human brains examined by Dr. KoUeston in reference to the de- 

 velojjment and character of this convolution, he found it in one 

 case entirely wanting on one side. Bischoff regards this as an 

 error, stating that this is a very t^-pical and characteristic convo- 

 lution, which, according to his view can never and will never be 

 found wanting where deep and extensive anomalies in brain de- 

 velopment have not taken place. 



In conclusion, he could but repeat the opinion of Ecker, "what 

 Bischoff says is also perfectly correct, that a large numl)er of tiie 

 convolutions of the cerebral hemisphere are arranged around the 

 ends of tlie primary furrows in more or less simple or compli- 

 cated arches ; and it cannot be otherwise, lor the ranges of moun- 

 tains inclosing a valley must necessarily pass into each other 

 where the valley ends, but no special explanation seems to be 

 thereby disclosed."

REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT FOR THE YEAR 

 ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 18T9. 



The histoiy of the Academy for the year ending Nov. 30, 1879, 

 is not ver}^ remarkable. It may be briefly stated. 



The Academy offered, Feb. 1879, to receive on deposit the col- 

 lections made bj- the second geological survey of the State of 

 Penns3-lvania; and asked the Legislature to appropriate raone}'- 

 towards enlargement of the building for the purpose of affording 

 ample space for the displa}- of a distinct collection of specimens 

 illustrative of all departments of the natural history of Pennsyl- 

 vania, including those of the geological survej's. It is believed 

 that a separate museum of the kind proposed would be attractive 

 and interesting to visitors generally, as well as instructive. It 

 would ultimately become an objective representation of all the 

 natural resources of the State, and possibly suggestive of new 

 applications of them in the industrial arts, and at the same time 

 tend to enhance in public estimation the value of the stud^' of the 

 natural sciences. 



All the members of the Legislature were invited to visit the 

 institution in the evening of April 25th. Several of those who 

 were present at this reception expressed opinions favoral^le to 

 granting the petition of the Academj-; but the Legislature finally 

 adjourned without acting upon it. 



A proposition to amend the by-laws, made 31ay 6th, was unani- 

 mously rejected Oct. 28th. 



Experience has demonstrated that the ordinary income of the 

 Societ}' is ver}' much less than the amount of its necessary' ex- 

 penses. After due consideration of the subject by the council it 

 was proposed to ask contributions from members and others 

 towards tlie creation of a maintenance or working fund of sufficient 

 amount to supply at least current deficiencies. 



A committee of forty members was appointed, Sept. 16th, by 

 the President, under autiioritj' of the Academj-, to solicit contri- 

 butions. The committee met, organized, and issued a circular in 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF IMIILADELPHIA. 433 



which reasons for the ai)pL'al are stated. Several snbscrii)tions 

 have been received and promised, making an aggregate of about 

 $3000, or about one-twentieth of the auiount considered to be 

 necessary. 



The financial condition of the Academy is full}' stated in the 

 report of the Treasurer. 



Two young men have been recipients of the benefits of the 

 Jessup Fund, one during the entire year, and the other frr nine 

 months. The apjilication of this fund has been so beneficent in 

 the past as to suggest that additional scholarships or fellowships 

 of the same kind would contribute largely to the general progress 

 of the natural sciences in this community. 



The extent of increase of the museum and of the lil>rarv. and 

 their condition, are stated i!i the annual reports of the curators 

 and the librarian. 



The annual reports of the several sections of the Academ}- in- 

 dicate that thej' are active and prosperous. 



The Biological and Microscojjical section gave a public reception 

 on tiie first ^londay of April, and a second on the first .Monday 

 of Noveml)er. The Entomological section participated in the last. 

 It is estimated that more than two thousand ladies and gentle- 

 men were present at each rece[)tion, and all seemed pleased. 

 Receptions of the kind are believed to be advantageous to the 

 general interests of tlie Societ}'. 



The average attendance at the meetings has ])een 32; the most 

 numerous, Feh. 4. 100. and the least, July 1.5 and August 20, 14. 



Alihough well known to the few old meml>ers still living, it 

 may be well on tliis occasion to recall part of the old story of the 

 foundation of the Academy. 



All the fountlers and early members wore uoi at the time 

 masters, or even advanced students, in any department of natural 

 history. The}- were, generally' speaking, young men whose liveli- 

 hood dependeil upon tlie profits of their d.iily avocations — men 

 who, though possilily not qualified to Ix' professors, were learned 

 enough to discern tliat they might lessen their own ignorance of 

 luitural things by employing tiieir leisure together, in a joint w.iy 

 to learn what others already knew, an<l possibly add something 

 to the common stock of knowledge. 



The first formal meeting for organization, January 2"). Isl2, is 

 recorded as a ''meeting of gentlemen, friends of science and of 




434 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



rational disposal of leisure moments." At a subsequent meeting 

 the association is descrilied as "a society of generous, good-willing 

 emulation for the acquirement, increase, simplification and diffu- 

 sion of natural knowledge." 



During the earliest years of the Society the members were often 

 entertained at the meetings by some one, previously appointed, 

 reading about some natural history subject, selected from a pub- 

 lished book or essay, which was discussed after the reading. Such 

 proceedings imply that mutual improvement was one of the objects 

 of the association. 



For the reason that the founders and first members regarded 

 themselves to be learners they called their Society an Academy", 

 meaning a school, the word being derived according to lexico- 

 graphers from Axafijy.uoj, the name of an Athenian citizen whose 

 house was converted into a school in which Plato taught. 



The general policy of the organization included the idea of 

 securing "the greatest good to the greatest number," and that all 

 should cheerfull3^ and sincerely co-operate to promote the welfare 

 of the Society according to the ascertained views of the majority. 

 March 21, 1812, the Society consisted of the six founders. In 

 the minutes of the meeting of that day they say, "unless we be 

 fiiithful and honorable to each other, and zealous for the interests 

 of science, such an establishment as we desire may never take 

 place." 



The qualifications for membership were friendliness to science 

 and good moral reputation and notliiug moi'e. To this day can- 

 didates are not required to possess any other qualifications. 

 Membership of this. Academy' does not, nor was it ever intended 

 to, imply an}^ kind or degree of scientific attainment, any more 

 than membership of a building association ini|)lies mechanical 

 skill in any department of construction or house building. 



There are societies whose certificate of membership is. in public 

 estimation, at the same time a certiilcate of scientific attainments. 

 The Academy cannot be properly classed with sucii societies, nor 

 is there any conclusive reason why it should aspire to be, or to 

 compete with institutions established on different principles or 

 for different purposes. 



The co-operative principle seems to have been recognized l)y the 

 founders. The}' l)egan at once to collect materials for a museum, 

 and books for a library, to the use of which all the members were 




1879.] NATIRAL SCIEN'CES OF PHILADELPHIA. 435 



equally entillcd, sultject only to sndi restrictions as were con- 

 sidered necessar}' for their preservation. 



From the formation of the society to the present time, its policy 

 has been based on sucli principles, and to those principles it owes 

 much of its substantial prosperity and present condition. 



Original research was not the sole object of the society, nor was 

 it ever designed tliat the society should be composed exclusively 

 of masters in science, specialists, or experts. Members worthy to 

 be so entitled are most desired and honored, most beneficial to the 

 Society, and most deserving to be aided in all reasonalile ways, 

 in the use of its accumulated means and facilities of stud v. not in 

 conflict with the rights which are alike and equally common 

 to all members, learned and unlearned. Xo part of the museum 

 or library can be held in reserve for the exclusive use of any class 

 of specialists. 



The pur[)Oses of the Academy are, and always have been : — 



1st, To aid and encourage those who may labor to increase 

 knowledge of natural objects, and of the laws under which they 

 exist. 



2d. To encourage and aid novitiates in natuial science. 



3d. To diffuse knowledge resulting from original researches, 

 among the votaries of natural science everywhere. 



4th. To render knowledge of the natural sciences generally 

 attractive and interesting to the public. 



The purpose first named, to encourage original investigations, 

 is manifest in the free access to the museum and library, given to 

 specialists who may desire to use those sources of information in 

 their studies, and in the publication of the results of their lal>ors 

 when desired. This sort of encouragement is not restricted to 

 members of the society. Publishing discoveries made elsewhere, 

 or by others than meml)ers of the Society, is no discredit to the 

 liberality of the Academy, and is surely not calculated to impede 

 original research. 



The purpose placed second, to encourage and aid novitiates, is 

 realized by instructing them individually, an<l pointing out to 

 them approved methods of stmly in order that they may l»ecome 

 qualified to engage profitaltly in original investigations. The 

 many beneficiaries of the Jessup Fund bear witness to the benefi- 

 cent influences of the Academy under this head. They compensate 

 the institution for the benefits it confers by the work they do for 




436 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



it muler the direction of the curators, and by becoming under its 

 auspices practical, working naturalists. 



The importance of this purpose lies in the fact that initiatory- 

 training and elementarj^ instruction are indispensable to the 

 attainment of the highest grades of learning. 



The third named purpose, to diffuse knowledge, is carried out 

 by pul)lishing a Journal, and the Proceedings of the Academy. 

 Tlie Journal now consists of eight octavo and seven quarto vol- 

 umes : the fourth part of the eighth volume is in preparation. 

 The " Proceedings of the Academy" numbers thirty-one 8vo vol- 

 umes. During the year 385 pages have been printed. 



The entomological section of the Acadeni}' has published during 

 the year, more than two hundred pages of original matter, result- 

 ing from the researches of members of the section and others. 

 Their printing has been done by members of the section in the 

 hall of the .Academy. 



It is proper to mention in this connection, "The Natural His- 

 tor\' of the Agricultural Ant of Texas," a monograph of the 

 habits and architecture of Pogonom3'rmex barbatus, by Henrj' 

 Christopher McCook, a member of tlie society, which has been 

 issued with the imprint and under tlie auspices of the Academ3% 

 It is an octavo volume of 310 pages, illustrated by 24 plates. 



Also the " Manual of Conchology, Structural and Systematic, 

 with illustrations of the s[)ecies," by George W. Tryon, Jr., con- 

 servator of the conchological section of the Academj', published 

 by the author, and issued from the Academy. The first volume 

 has appeared during the year. It is an octavo volume of 316 

 pages, illustrated by 112 plates, embracing 671 figures skilfully 

 drawn by Dr. Edward J. Nolan, who is the Librarian and Record- 

 ing Secretary of the Society. 



Mr. Herman Strecker, of Reading, Pa., a member of the 

 Academy, has published an octavo volume of 284 pages on the 

 " Butterflies and Moths of North America," in the composition of 

 which, he found valuable facilities in the library of the Academy. 

 In the pi'eface of his work he says : — " I shall never forget, when 

 a little boy, how ray heart bounded, when one day Professor 

 Joseph Leid}' took rae into the basement of tlie Philadelphia 

 Academy of Natural Sciences, and pointing to the books on en- 

 tomology, told me I had permission to examine their contents." 



The " Chronological History of Plants," a posthumous work 



I 




1879.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 437 



by Dr. Charles Pickering, was published at Boston, in Ma}-, 1879. 

 It is a quarto volume of 1222 pages. The work is conspicuous on 

 account of the immense erudition and industry displayed by the 

 author. It will ever stand an enduring monument significant of 

 the respect due to bis memory. 



This volume is mentioned here because Dr. Pickering was a 

 diligent student in the Academy, and served it efficiently and very 

 constantly during eleven years, from the early part of 1827 till 

 the middle of 1838. His studies in this Academy contributed 

 largely to qualify him to deserve the very high position he at- 

 tained in the scientific world. 



Gratuitous labor has produced all the matter published by the 

 Academy and its entomological section ; and probably the authors 

 of the volumes named have little hope of pecuniary profit from 

 their work. 



The fourth named purpose : to render knowledge of the natural 

 sciences attractive and interesting. 



During man}' years the students of all medical colleges in the 

 city have been freely admitted to the museum on exhibiting their 

 matriculating tickets to the janitor. Annual complimentary tick- 

 ets have been issued to the teachers of the public schools, who are 

 authorized to bring with them at each visit, a limited number of 

 their pupils. The museum is accessible to all persons every day 

 except Sunday, on the payment of an admission fee of ten cents. 

 The amount received on this account indicates that the museum 

 has been visited by 3540 persons besides members and those in- 

 troduced by them. 



Summaries of the proceedings of the Academy are published in 

 the newspapers. They are supposed to be generally interesting. 



In the ways indicated tlie several purposes of the institution 

 are carried out, it is believed, with considerable success. 



The sections afford opportunity to those having like pursuits 

 and congenial tastes to work together, and are useful in their in- 

 fluence on the general interests of the society. It is not perceived 

 tliat they are in any way detrimental to scientific progress. 



The by-law of May, 1876, which authorizes the appointment of 

 professors is inoperative, because the endowments for their sup- 

 port, which were hoped for at the time, have not been made, and 

 because candidates have not applied hv the positions. 



In spite of the lack of professors, the Academy is reasonably 




438 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1879. 



prosperous. It is free from debt. It has a substantial liome and 

 land enough upon which to extend it. It has a large and excel- 

 lent library adapted to its purposes, and large collections of natu- 

 ral objects, many of which have not been studied. It is conjec- 

 tured that the lil)rary and museum cannot be duplicated at this 

 time by the expenditure of half a million of dollars. 



Among its members are some who are conspicuous for attain- 

 ments, and for the discoveries they have made ; many who are 

 skilful specialists, and very many more who are availing them- 

 selves so diligently of the facilities which the Academ}^ affords 

 that there is ground to hope that when those who are now held in 

 the highest estimation shall have passed away, their places will 

 be filled by men as great or even greater than the^"^ are now be- 

 lieved to be. 



Notwithstanding the general character of its membership, and 

 the unpretentious methods and policy which it has followed in the 

 past, there are associated with the Academy some among those 

 who liave died, whose names are widely known and respected on 

 account of the positions they attained in science. We may name 

 for examples, Charles L. Bonaparte, John Cassin, Edward Hal- 

 lowell, Wra. M. Gabb, Richard Harlan, Charles A. Leseur, James 

 Aitken Meigs, Samuel George Morton, Thomas Nuttall, George 

 Ord, Charles Pickering, Thomas Say, and Gerard Troost ; and 

 others might be added who in their day were wortlu' and respected 

 on account of their attainments, and their contributions to scien- 

 tific i)rogress. 



Tliere is no substantial reason to mourn now on account of the 

 l)resent condition or the future prospects of the Academy. 



The whole is submitted, 



W. S. W. RUSCHENBERGER.

 have also been finished, leaving onl^' those on anthrojjolog}' and 

 mineralogy to be yet entered. In addition to the books catalogued, 

 there are in tlie library a large number of literarj', artistic, and 

 historical works to which I have before called attention for the 

 purpose of recommending that they be sold, and the funds ap[)lied 

 to the purchase of books more specially useful to the society. In 

 the hope that this disposition may he made of these works, it is 

 not the intention at present to extend the card entries to these 

 departments, so that the catalogue will probabi}' be completed 

 early next year. 



Constant effort has been made to complete, as far as possible, 

 the sets of periodicals in the librar3', and to add those not yet in 

 the possession of the Academy. Tiiis work will lie materially 

 forwarded by the issue of Mr. Scudder's invalual)le Catalogue of 

 {Scientific Serials, which furnishes a means not before at hand of 

 determining our deficiencies. 



For the amounts exi)ended on the purchase of books reference 

 is made to the report of the Treasurer. The accompanying list 

 of additions made during the year indicates, as heretofore, that 

 for the most valuable items, apart from our exchanges, we are 

 dependent upon the I. V. ^Villiamson Fund. 



All of which is respectfully submitted, 



Edw. J. Nolan, 



Librarian. 



REPORT OF THE CURATORS. 



The Curators report tliat during the year all tiie various col- 

 lections of the Museum have been carefully inspected and cared 

 for, and that they are all in good condition. A violent storm, 

 which caused considerable destruction of glass and flooding of 

 rain, wetted some parts of the collections, but the objects were 

 speedih' dried, so tiiat little serious damage resulted, except the 

 loss of several specimens of eciiinoderms. Mr. .1. A. Ryder has 

 been continuously engaged in identifying, arranging, and label- 

 ing the collection of fisiies. There have l»een identified upwards 

 of 700 species of 325 genera. The Ronaparte collection of lishes, 

 considering the tin>e it has been preserved, is in excellent condition.

442 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



Mr. Spencer Trotter has also been engaged in the arrangement 

 of the birds. 



The collection of vertebrate fossils from the New Jersey cretace- 

 ous and tertiary marls, wliich are very liable to decomposition from 

 exposure to the air, have been treated so as to preserve them, and 

 they have been arranged and labeled. 



Most of the specimens received during the year have been 

 placed in their proper positions in the various collections. 



The most important addition to the Museum during the year, 

 consists of the Archgeological collection belonging to the Ameri- 

 can Philosophical Society, deposited with tiie Academy by reso- 

 lution of Nov. 16, 1877. The collection mainly consists of the 

 Poinsett collection of Mexican antiquities and many Peruvian 

 and other American antiquities. The Academy is indebted to 

 Mr. William S. Yaux, for defra^-ing the expense of adapting one 

 of the entresol rooms to the proper exhibition of the collection. 



The contributions in the various departments during the year, 

 excepting those reported on by some of the special sections, are 

 as follow : —

REPORT OF THE COXCHOLOGICAL SECTION, 



The Recorder of the Conchological Section respectfully reports 

 that during 1879 papers have been accepted and published in the 

 Academy's Proceedings aggregating 90 pages, bj- authors as fol- 

 lows: — 



W. G. Binney, 1 page. Aiigelo Heilprin, 6 pages. 



Andrew Garrett, 14 pages. R. E. C. Stearns, 7 pages. 



Dr. R. Bergh, 62 pages. 



On the 0th of last January the Section met with a severe loss 

 in the death of the Rev. E. R. Beadle. 



From its formation to the time of his death Dr. Beadle was the 

 secretary of the Conchological Section, and his ability and ex- 

 tended acquaintance among scientists both at home and abroad 

 went far towards making it a success. His loss will be deeply 

 felt by many who, in common with ourselves, have been richh- 

 benefit'.'d b^' his acquaintance and influence. 



The Conservator, Mr. George W. Tr3-on, Jr., reports that, dur- 

 ing the year ending Decemlter 1,2750 trays, containing 11,895 

 specimens of shells and moUusks, have been determined, labelled, 

 mounted, and placed in the collection. The most of these belong 

 to the Swift CoUeclion, the arrangement of which, after three 

 vears' labor, is now completed. The Swift Cabinet was given to 

 the Acadeni}' upon condition that it should not be incorporated 

 with the geneial collection, and this condition is complied with by 

 placing the specimens in drawers protected b}- glass tops, and 




446 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1879. 



placed under the corresponding genera contained in the table 

 cases. It is proposed to appropriately letter the fronts of these 

 drawers, and then unlock them so that the}' may be opened by the 

 public. The Swift Collection is rich in West Indian shells, and 

 particularly so in terrestrial species: it comprises 7058 trays, con- 

 taining 30,384 specimens. Mr. W. G. Binney has frequently 

 favored us with specimens of rare American terrestrial mollusks 

 during the year, so as to nearly complete our series of these shells. 

 Dr. W. D. Hartman, of Westchester, who is i)reparing for publi- 

 cation a revision of the Partulidoe, has carefully examined our 

 collection of these perplexing shells, and added a number of spe- 

 cies. We arc indebted to Dr. J. J. Brown for a good collection 

 of marine shells from the Bahama Islands, and to Mr. Henry 

 Vendr3es for a fine series of Jamaica Miocene shells. A typical 

 suite of the land shells collected by the late Wm. M. Gabb in 

 Costa Kica is among the important additions to our ^Museum dur- 

 ing the year. A detailed list of donations is annexed to this 

 report. 



The Section is again greatly indebted to Mr. Charles F. Parker 

 for valuable assistance in preparing specimens for exhibition, the 

 ■whole of the additions to the cabinet during the year having been 

 mounted on tablets, and placed on appropriate paper trays by 

 him. We are also much indebted to Mr. John Ford for preparing 

 sections of shells for the purpose of showing their internal form. 

 It is proposed to exhibit a section of a characteristic form in each 

 genus, and Mr. Ford has kindly undertaken to prepare them 

 for us. 



The officers of the Section for 1880 are — 



Director . . . W. S. W. Ruschenberger, M.D. 



Vice-Director . . John Ford. 



Recorder . . . S. Raymond Roberts.

REPORT OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SECTION. 



The Section reports that its meetings have been regularly held 

 during the past year on the second Friday evening of each month 

 excepting in July and August'. In December the meeting takes 

 place immediately after that of the American Entomological 

 Society on the second Wednesday evening. 



The membership is now thirty, having been increased during 

 the year by the admission of Geo. B. Cresson. 



The average attendance at the meetings has been six. 



At all of the meetings scientific communications have been 

 made by the members, either in the form of verbal remarks or 

 written papers, the authors in the latter case presenting verball}', 

 in brief, the more important points of tlieir papers. 



Among the more interesting communications may be mentioned 

 those presented b}'^ Rev. Dr. McCook, on the Honey Ant of our 

 western countrv, the habits being now very fully made known 

 through his untiring industry under unfavorable surroundings. 



Written communications have been presented as follows : '* De- 

 scriptions of new species of Xortli American H^-meiioptera," "Cat- 

 alogue of North American Apidic," both by E. T. Cresson; " On 

 the Chrysides of North America," by Edw. Norton; " Catalogue 

 of the ^lutillidte of North America, with description of new spe- 

 cies,'' by Chas. A. Blake; "Synopsis of the Monotomidaj of the 




1870.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 449 



United States," •• Synoi)sis of tlie Nitidiilidic of the I'liited 

 States," '' Notes on the Mycteridae and other Heteromera of the 

 United States," by George H. Horn, M.D. 



The foregoing have been publislied as part of the Transactions 

 of tlie American Entomological Society, and togotlier with papers 

 inilflished during December of last year, amount to one hundred 

 and seventy-three pages with one plate. 



In addition to the above the following papers have been ac- 

 cepted for publication, and will form part of Volume Till, of the 

 Transactions: "Descriptions of new species of Xorth American 

 Hymenoptera," '' Catalogue of North American Tenthridinidae 

 and Uroceridae," b}- E. T. Cresson ; "Notes on the Asaphes of 

 Boreal America," "Revision of the Dascyllidae of the United 

 States," " Contril)utions to the Colcopterology of the United 

 States," by George II. Horn, M.D. ; "Short Studies on North 

 American Coleoptera," by J. L, LeConte, M.D. 



With the beginning of the 3-ear the Section has published the 

 '■ Proceedings of the month!}' meetings of the Entomological Sec- 

 tion of tlie Academy of Natural Sciences," in which are contained 

 a record of the doings of the Section with the shorter papers and 

 verl>al communications from the members, and a list of all publi- 

 cations received in exchange, by purchase or from the authors.. 



The total publications excluding Index are — 

 Transactions of the American Entomological Society . 173 pp. 

 Proceedings of the Section 34 pp. 



Giving a total of 207 pp. 



By the invitation of tlie Biological and Microscopical Section, 

 the Entomological Section joined with them on the occasion of 

 their last reception in the endeavor to make the resources of the 

 Academy more wi<lely known, and the exhibition more varied 

 and entertaining to those who favored us with a visit. The 

 crowded rooms and the interest shown liy our visitors spoke 

 well not only for the grand microscopical display, but also for our 

 more modest exhil)it. 



During the year the collections have been carefully examined 

 several times thoroughly by the Conservator and by the members 

 while using them. They arc reported in good order. Very few 

 adthtions have been made.

REPORT OF THE BOTANICAL SECTION. 



The A'ice-Director of the Botanical Section has much pleasure in 

 reporting to the Academy the satisfactory' progress it has made 

 during the past year. The Section now consists of thirty-five 

 members, and the meetings hold every month, except August and 

 September, liave been well attended. At these meetings many 

 new and valuable facts in relation to our local flora, as well as to 

 the science of Botany in general, have been contributed b}' many 

 of the members. Of the papers read before the meetings one by 

 Mr. Ellis, of Newfield, New Jersey, and one b^' Professor Asa 

 Gray, have been of such general importance as to receive the re- 

 commendation of the Section to the Academy* for publication in 

 its proceedings. 



In regard to the valuable Herbarium it is pleasant to report 

 that the additions of the past and previous year together are far 

 be3ond those of b.\\\ period for many yeai's past. 



That so many distinguished men should have aided the Academy 

 in this handsome manner shows their high appreciation of its 

 work and usefulness. In the arrangement of the Herbarium a 

 place has been reserved for every genus, and it is gratifying to 

 note that the hiati are now mostly of genera from regions rarely 

 explored, and that even these are gradually being filled, so that 

 tlie floras of even the most distant parts of the world arc fairly 

 represented ou our shelves. 




1870.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PIIILADELPIIIA. 451 



Tlic work of revising the various families so as to Itring the 

 nomenclature in accord with modern views, and which in former 

 reports it was believed could scarcely be accomi)lished without 

 the emi)lovment of experts to be especially engaged for the pur- 

 pose, still remains to be done — but the voluntary labors of several 

 distinguished botanists have aided us the past j'ear to a good be- 

 ginning for even this herculean task, and we ma}' hope that it 

 will not be ver}' long before the whole is treated in the same waj'. 



It is no derogation to the assistance we have received from 

 man^' members and friends to say that much of the excellent pro- 

 gress made is due to the energ}' of our Conservator Mr. -lohn II. 

 Redfield, whose report in detail has been adopted by the Section 

 as part of this report. 



Thomas Meeiian, 



Vice- Dire dor. 



The Conservator reports that the work of the past year has 

 been mainly directed to the improvement of the condition of the 

 Academy'svaluable Herbarium, and this lal)or has been interrupted 

 only by the necessar}' care and attention bestowed upon the con- 

 stant new accessions to its stores. 



The order-tablets and genus lists for the Xorth American Herba- 

 rium have been completed. 



Mr. Isaac C. Martindale has carefully elaborated and catalogued 

 the species of Clematis, Anemone, and one or two other allied 

 genera, l)Oth in the general and in the North American depart- 

 ments, a tedious and diflBcult labor which has revealed both the 

 extent and the weaknesses of our collection. Mi. Charles F. Par- 

 ker has also neatly mounted these species, and the work of these 

 two gentlemen, while only the beginning of a gigantic task, is a 

 model for future workers. 



Dr. Asa Gray, of Camliridge, has during the year revised for us 

 some of the most perplexing of the genera of the North American 

 Compositje, such as Vernonia, Solidago, Chrysopsis, etc., and Mr. 

 Parker is securing to ns the result of this labor, by mounting the 

 plants (with Dr. Gray's notes afBxed) as fast as elaborated. 



Mr. Ik'bb, who, in 1S7*^, worked out for us the willows of our 

 North American Herbarium, has this year performed a similar 

 service upon those of the general Herbarium, with infinite addition 

 to their scientific value. 




452 PROOEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [18T9. 



Mr. V. L. Scribner has continued bis careful and scrutinizing 

 work upon our grasses, mounting tbem as be progresses, and we 

 may expect an earl}' coni()letion of so much of the work as relates 

 to tbe North American Herbarium. 



Tlie Conservator has mounted and ticketed that portion of tbe 

 North American Herbarium wbicli extends from tlie Order Good- 

 eniaceos to Order Gentianaceaj inclusive, and hopes to continue 

 the worl^. 



Tlie accessions to our collection have been constant, extensive, 

 and valuable. Tbe number of species received during the year 

 has been 2181, of which a good proportion were new to our shelves. 

 All tliese have been carefully poisoned, labeled, mounted, and 

 distributed in the proper orders. Mr. C. F. Parker has been of 

 most essential service in this work, giving us man}- liours of labor 

 over and above his engagements with the Acadera}*. 



Among the valuable additions of the 3'ear may be speciall}'' 

 mentioned 623 species of Florida plants, embracing many new 

 and rare species, collected by Dr. A. P. Garber, of Columbia, Pa., 

 and b}' him generously' presented to the Academy ; and many 

 hundreds of rare plants from Northern and Central Asia, North- 

 ern, Southern, and Central Africa, Borneo, Kerguelen Land, 

 Polynesia, California, Oregon, etc., presented b}- Dr. Asa Gray, 

 of Cambridge, Mass. 



A complete list of the donations during the 3'ear is appended 

 to the rej)ort now respectfull}' submitted.

REPORT OF THE MINERALOGICAL SECTION. 



The Director of the Mineralogical Section of the Academy' of 

 Natural Sciences, would respectfull}' report that meetings of the 

 Section have been held regularly every month, except July and 

 August. The attendance has been larger than in the prior year, 

 and there has lieen no lack of interest. 



Reference to the annexed list of donations will show that the 

 increase of the collection of the Academy has been satisfactory. 




18T9.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 455 



The local collection has been arranged and labeled. 



At the Februar^'^ meeting it was decided to admit, as associate 

 members, i)ersons interested in mineralogj' but ineligible to active 

 meml)er.ship by reason of not being members of tlie Acadeui}'. 

 Several such have been elected, and have attended the meetings 

 and taken much interest in the proceedings. 



Through the courtes}' of the Biological and Microscopical Sec- 

 tion, the Mineralogical Section has had the use of microscopes iu 

 the examination of sections of rocks, and of minerals included 

 in others. Several inteiesting exhil)itions of this character were 

 had, showing an entertaining, and, as 3'et, little explored region, 

 in which it is hoped the lady members of the Section may find a 

 field peculiarly suited to their opi)ortunities of study. 



It is purposed to present to the Academy for publication a state- 

 ment of the more important communications made to the Section.

 net during the j'ear has been furnished b3'Mr. Ciias. F. Parker: —
