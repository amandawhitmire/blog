On a fossil of the Puma. — Prof. Leidy directed attention to a spec- 

 imen recently sent to him for identification from Sparta, Illinois. 

 It is the cranial portion of a skull of the Puma, Fells concolor, and 

 was found under about thirty feet of earth, when digging in the bed 

 of the Kaskaskia river, for a bridge pier. It accords with the cor- 

 responding part of recent animals, though presenting some slight 

 ditferences from a number of skulls of our museum. The most strik-

ing difference is in the interparietal crest which is higher and of 

 more uniform height and is especially higher in front. The narrow 

 part of the cranial case is narrower and the forehead is more mesially 

 depressed between the angular processes. Comparative measure-

On the relation of Sarracenia purpurea to Sarracenia variolaris. 

 — Prof W. P. Wilson remarked that /Sarracema jowrjowrea produces 

 two kinds of leaves. As the young plantlet first develops itself from 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 11 



the seed it forms a few leaves which differ widely from those which 

 appear on the same plant a little later. The adult stage of these 

 first leaves is from a twentieth to a tenth smaller than the adult 

 stage of the second or later developed leaves. Generally only from 

 five to ten of these first-leaves are produced. 



After the second leaves begin to appear, then no more of the first 

 form are grown by the plant. 



In the ordinary leaves of S. purpurea it is well known that the 

 hood surmounting the hollow leaf is erect and in no wise protects 

 or covers its opening. In S. variolar is this is just the opposite — 

 here the hood, a little above and back of the opening, makes a 

 sharp bend forward and not only covers over the whole orifice but 

 projects beyond it on all sides nearly i inch. 



These first or seedling leaves of S. purpurea resenfl^le in form not 

 the later and adult leaves on the same plant, but those of iS. vario- 

 laris. The hood is not erect but arches over the hollow leaf in pre- 

 cisely the same manner as in the adult leaves of /S. variolaris. 



There are also two forms of leaves in S. variolaris. In this plant, 

 however, the differences are not so much a matter of shape as appar- 

 ently of arrested development. The first leaves are very much like 

 the adult form on the same plant only being from ten to twenty 

 times smaller. 



But the important fact remains to be stated : — the first leaves from 

 each of these plants are perfect miniatures of each other. It would 

 be next to impossible for an expert to separate them, should they 

 happen to become mixed, and to accurately say which belonged to 

 the one or which to the other of the two species. 



The production of this first set of leaves by S. purpurea which so 

 very closely resemble the ordinary leaves of *S. variolaris had led him 

 to believe that the species jaurpitrea is a retrograde development from 

 variolaris. 



His belief in this is, however, not wholly based on the production of 

 the early leaves, but rests upon several other important facts. 



S. variolaris is a very highly specialized plant for the purpose of 

 catching and digesting insects. Up and down the margin of the 

 wing and around the mouth of the protected pitcher are numerous 

 honey glands. In the interior is the smooth surface and also the 

 hairy ones to prevent the escape of insects which have fed up to the 

 top of the leaf and then fiillen into this treacherous opening. These 

 special adaptations are all present in S. purpurea, but the honey- 

 glands seldom secrete any nectar and are sometimes even rudi- 

 mentary. Again the fluid found in S. variolaris contains a consider- 

 able quantity" of a digestive ferment which acts directly upon the 

 entrapped insects. This is not so in the fluid excreted by the leaves of 

 S. purpurea. Only a trace of this ferment could be found after the 

 most careful chemical search for it.

Mimicry among Plants. — Prof. J. T. Kothrock remarked that 

 among animals mimicry is usually related to the safety of the indi- 

 vidual, or less frequently to the ease by which it may conceal itself 

 and thus more readily capture its food. Whatever may be the cause 

 of mimicry among plants, or by whatever governing forces one plant 

 in the long run, may come to resemble another more or less remotely 

 related to it, it is clear that neither of the causes which are associated 

 ■with mimicry among animals can obtain in the vegetable kingdom. 



These mimetic cases may conveniently be ranged under two heads. 



1. Those in which we find the resemblances between plants in 

 groups clearly distinct. The lower of these may sometimes well be 

 called anticipating or prophetic types. 



2. Those found between plants in the same natural family, where 

 the descent within recent period, of one from the other, may rea- 

 sonably be supported by all who admit the doctrine of evolution. 

 This resemblance is of course often merely external, disappearing 

 under even the slightest examination ; as, for example, when one 

 glances hastily at a specimen, particularly an herbarium specimen, 

 oi Zygadenus elegans Pursh, and then compai*es it with a narrow- 

 leaved specimen of Swertia perennis. There ai'e few who will not be 

 struck with the likeness, yet the former is a well marked represen- 

 tation of the monocotyledonous group, and the other as evidently one 

 of the dicotyledonous plant. It is somewhat startling to find 

 along with marked points of distinction that there exist certain struct- 

 ural resemblances ; thus one may well compare the unusual mark- 

 ings found on the bases of the perianth divisions in Zygadenus 

 with the equally unusual gland found at the base of the petals in 

 Swertia. There is in these resemblances nothing which can in any 

 sense be called prophetic, because the relationship between the ex- 

 amples is quite too remote. 



The case is, however, somewhat different when one compares the 

 shape of some of the young liverwort with the prothallus of some 

 ferns. Here the resemblance is often very marked and the line of 

 relationship not so distant. It might almost be said that the perma- 

 nent form of the liverwort clearly resembled the early, transient 

 form of the fern. 



Or, as another instance, compare the protonema of a moss before 

 the shoot appears which is to develop into the erect aerial branch, 

 with one of our filamentous algse. Here again we have so marked 

 a general resemblance that it may well enough be classed with the 

 prophetic types. 




,] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. IS 



The second group to which allusion has been made — those in which 

 the resemblance is betAveen related plants, may be fairly illustrated 

 by the resemblance betweeii Nepeta Glechoma and Lamium am- 

 plexicaule, especially when (as is often the case in Nepeta) the petioles 

 are very much reduced in length. 



Another unusual resemblance comes to mind. One may easily 

 understand why the cup found about the base of the stigma in so 

 many of the Lobeliaceae should be so exactly repeated in the allied 

 order of Goodeniaceae. ■ But how are we to explain its appearance 

 in Qaura (one of the Onagraceae) which can hardly be regarded as 

 closely related to either of the above orders. These resemblances 

 and the questions growing out of them are to be further considered 

 in a paper in course of preparation.

A BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND SYNONYMIC CATALOGUE OF THE 

 GENUS ACHATINELLA, 



BY W. D. HARTMAK, M. D. 



The genus Acliatinella,^ embraces a group of small, beautiful and 

 variously colored land shells, peculiar to the Sandwich Islands. 

 Mr. Swainson first introduced the genus to the notice of naturalists 

 in Brand's Journal, in 1828, and in 1831 the same author assigned 

 it a position in the systematic arrangement of species, under the 

 above name. Since that period many new species have been describ- 

 ed by naturalists. Dr. L. PfeifFer in the ^Slalakozoologische Blatter, 

 and subsequently others have proposed sub-divisions for the numer- 

 ous and diversified forms embraced by the genus. In some 

 instances the lines of these sub-divisions are well-defined, while in 

 others they are less marked. They have been generally adopted by 

 conchologists, as they are found convenient for the arrangement of 

 a collection. Mr. Thomas Bland says "the distinctions derived 

 from the consideration of the form of the shells are arbitrary, and the 

 limits are not well defined." His classification of the sub-divisions 

 of the genus, is chiefly founded on the structure of the lingual den- 

 tition, "which indicates three groups, a. Partulina and Achatinella 

 b. Newcombia and Laminella, and c. Leptachatina ; judging from the 

 shells alone, Bulimella and Apex belong to group a, while Labiella 

 belongs to group 6 or c rather than to a." This arrangement is 

 chiefly in accord with that of Dr. PfeifFer and Mr. William H. Pease, 

 for the details of which I must refer the reader to their several pa- 

 pers. I agree with Dr. Pfeiflfer in eliminating Carelia and Auricu- 

 lella as separate genera from Achatinella, and I also concur with 

 Dr. Gulick in the opinion that Frickella should be added to Auri- 

 culella. I am also in accord with Mr. Lovell Peeve in the opinion 

 that the small common shells for which Dr. Gould proposed the 

 name of Leptachatina, should be removed from Achatinella, as they 

 are more nearly allied to the Oleacinidse than to the Bulimidse, and 

 they differ from Achatinella in being oviparous while the latter are 

 viviparous. In consequence of the connection heretofore existing be- 



* Although Auriculella possesses the same form of dentition as Partula 

 and Achatinella, Dr. Pfeiffer has placed it in a separate genus, on conchological 

 grounds, in which I concur. These minute shells, would seem to have no place 

 in a serial arrangement of the genus Achatinella. Species marked f are in the 

 author's collection. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 17 



tweeii Achatinella and Leptachatina, the latter has received especial 

 attention in the preparation of this paper, and for the present it has 

 been retained in the genus Achatinella. In analyzing the species 

 of Leptachatina proposed b}^ Dr. Gould, of which L. acuminata Gld. 

 was designated as the type, they are found to be divisible into three 

 groups. In the first may be placed the elongate or cylindi'ical and 

 semi-transparent varieties, as L. acuminata, striatula and cerealis 

 Gould, gracilis PfeifFer, tenebrosa Pease, terebralis and exilis Gul., 

 scndfusca Newc. In the second, the short oval clear and polished va- 

 rieties, as cingula INIigh. saccata Hartm. brevicula Pse. and nitida 

 Newc. And in the third, the larger inflated and more stout species, as 

 Hartmaiiii Newc. M. S. succincta, fumosa, and vitrea Newc, fusea and 

 resinula Gul. together with corneola and pyramis Pfr. The major 

 part of the species are terrestrial in their habits, while a few are 

 arboreal. In my examination of the Achatinellse, I have also inclu- 

 ded the allied genus Auriculella. The generic name oi Achatinella 

 has been used by all authors previous to Dr. Pfeiffer's sub-division 

 of the genus in Malakozoologische Blatter in 1854 and 1856. Owing 

 to several causes the species have been burthened with numerous 

 synonyms, many of which have been herein omitted, to avoid a 

 needless repetition of names. Their variability in form, age and 

 color, has misled naturalists into the error of multiplying the spe- 

 cies, and a change of environment Dr. Newcomb informs us, is 

 known to so alter tlie appearance of some, as to cause them to be 

 mistaken for distinct species. A change of environment and mal- 

 nutrition materially modifies the growth of all animals, and no- 

 where is it more observable than in the molluscan fauna. The 

 diflTerent appearance of depauperized or aberranc forms of shells is a 

 prolific source of error, and often of embarrassment to the student of 

 natural history, since corrections can only be made by the examin- 

 ation of types in scattered collections. Mr. Geo. W. Tryon Jr. in 

 his recent books on conchology, has relegated to synonymy many 

 shells heretofore considered of specific value, some of which are 

 doubtless the result of environment or hybridization. In the early 

 history of the genus Achatinella, naturalists in different parts of the 

 world were engaged at the same time in describing the species, and 

 some of the names then given have only been established by priority 

 of publication. The application of boiling Avater to remove the an- 

 imal, materially alters the color of the shell, changing a green or 

 bright green to a dirty yellow^ ; and the manufacture of species by 




18 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



scraping, has also been resorted to, to increase the number of com- 

 mercial species. 



Hybridization may have been a factor in the origin of some va- 

 rieties as occurs in the allied genus Partula. The preservation of 

 the species in the lower animals is due in a great measure to animal 

 instinct, but where nearly allied species are thrown together, as often 

 happens in the involuntary change of position of Achatinella, or the 

 proximity of broods, as occurs with Partula, hybridization may take 

 place. It is well known that embryonic yoiuig are priceless to the 

 biologist, and since the tissue cells of species evolute from pre-exist- 

 ing germs and do not originate de novo, the shape of the embryonic 

 or apical fold of each species of viviparous mollusk, should be the 

 true index of a species, except in the case of hybrids, when it would 

 take the form of one or the other of the parents, and would be far- 

 ther distinguished in the adult, by the form, size and color of the 

 predominating parent, a law always observable in hybrids. 



Dr. Isaac Lea has always maintained the importance of the shape 

 •of the apical fold, for a correct determination of a species of Unio, 

 I have said elsewhere, that viviparous hermaphrodite mollusca (being 

 cold blooded animals) would probably more readily hybridize than 

 warm blooded, which might in a measure account for the numerous 

 forms and varieties of Unionidse and Strepomatidse in the rivers of 

 the United States. The late Prof. Haldeman believed that hybrid 

 Unios existed, and farther that individuals between Melantho decisa 

 and 31. ponderosa Say are often found, which look very much like 

 hybrids of these species. It is well-known that fish, frogs and toads 

 (which are cold blooded animals) hybridize, and recently some spe- 

 cies of salmon have been successfully and profitably hybridized. 



So far as known the food plants of the Achatinella have no in- 

 fluence in the coloration of the shell; those species possessing a 

 black, dark or slate colored mantle, secrete a variegated shell, while 

 others with a greenish, bluish, light yellow or flesh-colored mantle, 

 secrete a shell with different shades of yellow. The varied and gor- 

 geous tints of the shells of Achatinella?, are probably owing to the 

 action of light and oxygen on the secretions from the glands of the 

 mantle ; the striations and variations of color, are probably due to 

 the chemical composition of a fluid from a difierent set of glands ; 

 hence the painting of the arboreal species is more bright and pleasing 

 than that of the terrestrial, which are generally of uniform and somber 

 hues. The surface of all the porphyroid and gaily painted species, 

 exhibit under a glass, waved spiral strise, similar to Partulje. These 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 19 



lines commence at the termination of the first one-and-a-half whorls 

 of the apex, which corresponds to their embryonic age. The apices 

 of some of the Amastra are coarsely plicate, in this respectresem- 

 bling Laminella. This is especially noticeable in the elongate spe- 

 cies, as A. magna, assimilis, biplicata, Huchinsomi, turritella and some 

 others which have been classed with Laminella by Dr. Pfeiffer ; in 

 others the plicse of the apex are small -wrinkles, and in A. farcimen, 

 reticulata, tristis, elliptica, and soine others, the apex is smooth and 

 rounded, forming a sub-group of Amastra. A more constant char- 

 acter is found in the species of Amastra being deditxde of spiral 

 striae, differing in this respect from the ])orphyroid Achatinellse. 

 The Amastra being ground species and living beneath dead leaves 

 and other debris, when the shells are deprived of the animal and are 

 exposed to the atmosphere, the epidermis is more readil}-^ detached 

 than in other Achatiuellse. 



"The facts relating to the geographical distribution of Achati- 

 nella, and the development of so large a numlier of species within 

 the limits of small areas, are very remarkable and interesting, 

 and have presented problems bearing or. the theories of evolu- 

 tion. Each island has its own peculiar species, and not only species, 

 but its own peculiar types, or groups of species, of similar form. 

 Again, on islands where there has been a full development of Acha- 

 tinella, each principal mountain ridge and valley has its own pecu- 

 liar species Avhich are found nowhere else; the species of each ridge 

 or valley being often connected with those of the next — by intermediate 

 varieties. Another important fact observed in the distribution of the 

 Aehatinella is. that on a mountain chain with many culminating 

 peaks, the tendency is to divergence of sj^ecies, while on an indi- 

 vidual mass of mountains concentrating towards a single culminating 

 peak, the tendency is to a convergence of species." "The structure 

 of the Hawaian Islands is volcanic ; and in studying the distribution 

 of shells over tliem, it is important to note the relative ages of the 

 several islands. Geologically speaking, Kauai is the oldest ; next 

 in the series is Oahu ; then Maui with the adjoining islands of 

 Molokai and Lanai ; and last comes Hawaii, in the southern por- 

 tion of which volcanic fires are still raging." 



" Oahu. The development of Aehatinella on this island, both as 

 regards number and variety of form and color, has been greater than 

 on any other island of the group. Unlike most of the other islands 

 which have individual mountain masses, Oahu has two true ranges 

 or chains of mountains, a longer and a shorter one, with many in- 




20 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



dependent culminating peaks. The aggregate length of the two 

 ranges is 50 miles. The sides of these ranges, their entire length, 

 are furrowed by deep valleys separating lofty ridges. These val- 

 leys and ridges are the home of Achatinella: each valley and 

 ridge has its own distinct species Avhich ai-e connected with those of 

 the next valley and ridge, by a multitude of intermediate varieties, 

 presenting minute gradations of form and color. These two ranges 

 of mountains have already furnished 227 distinct described species 

 of Achatmella, the number of varieties has been estimated as high as 

 800 or 900. All these species and varieties, are found in an area of 

 less than 120 square miles ; and a considerable portion of the longer 

 range remains yet to be explored. These species have all the va- 

 rious shapes from globose to conic, ovate and elongate-conical, and 

 present almost every possible shade and variety of coloring, from 

 pure white to jet black, and all the shades of green, rose, yellow, 

 brown and ash ; sometimes several of these colors are combined in 

 one species, either in regular or irregular bands, or tessellated, nyir- 

 bled or zigzaged designs." 



"West Maui. On this part of Maui we have the converse of 

 Oahu. Its individual mass of mountains, clustering around one com- 

 mon centre p.eak, 2000 feet higher than any part of Oahu, furnishes 

 only 30 described species of Achatinella, each principal valley and 

 ridge has its own peculiar species or varieties ; but all the arboreal 

 species can be referred to seven leading types, these differ much from 

 the Oahu types, and do not present the same varieties of form or 

 color. The prevailing colors are white and dark brown Avith all the 

 intervening shades of either, plain or variously arranged in bands 

 or zigzaged lines." 



"East Maui. The distribution of Achatinella on this part 

 of Maui is not fully known. All its mountain gorges and ridges 

 concentrate around the rim of the immense crater of Haleakala, a 

 circumscribing bound of nearly thirty miles in extent. The almost 

 impenetrable forest on the mountain slopes to the east and south 

 of the crater comprising a belt of tw^enty miles long and six miles 

 wide, remain unexplored, and its molluscan life is unknown. The 

 ■woodlands on the north-west slope of the mountain facing West 

 Maui furnish 29 described species of Achatinella ; but they are the 

 same or unmistakable counterparts of those found on West Maui. 

 The narrow depression of land between East and West Maui has 

 led many to infer that they Avere originally separate islands, this 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 21 



similarity of shell-types Avould seem to indicate that, if ever separate, 

 they must have been united before the development of molluscan 

 life ; otherwise we should expect to find the types of East and West 

 Maui differing as much from each other as do those of Maui and 

 the contiguous islands of Molokai and Lanai." 



" MoLOKAi. The distribution of Achatinella on this island pre- 

 sents some new features not observed on any other island. The 

 island is forty miles long with a width of only seven miles, it is 

 about one-third the size of Oahu, and like it has a mountain range 

 extending nearly thirty miles thi'ough its length. The range is fur- 

 rowed on each side by deep valleys. Some of these mountain 

 gorges are very Avide and cut deep into the narrow axis of the island. 

 The larger ones have proved an effectual barrier to the migration 

 of the shells. The island is thus divided into three natural sections, 

 and each section retains its own peculiar species without intermin- 

 gling with those of the next section." " Molokai furnishes 25 de- 

 scribed species which are about equally divided between the three 

 sections of the island, these shells exhibit more variety of form and 

 color than those of Maui, and have peculiarities which separate 

 them entirely from types of other islands." 



" Lanai. This is the smallest and most arid of the shell produc- 

 ing islands. Its area is 100 square miles, of which probably not 

 over one tenth is suited for the support of mollusks. The island is, 

 however notable as the home of A. magna Adams, the largest shell 

 of the whole Achatinella family. Specimens in our cabinet measure 

 I2 inches long, the whole number of species of Achatinella on Lanai 

 is 13, and they exhibit peculiarities of type." 



" Kauai. This is the oldest and most verdant island of the group. 

 It lies to the west of Oahu, and is separated from it by a channel 

 wider than occurs between any of the other islands. Its extensive 

 forests, luxuriant vegetation and moist climate render it peculiarly 

 adapted for the abode of Achatinella ; and one would naturally ex- 

 pect to find here a larger, and if possible, higher development of the 

 family. But we are doomed to disappointment, the island yields no 

 arboreal species, the shells are terrestrial, and those classed with 

 Achatinella belong to the plainest forms of the Amastra and Lepta- 

 chatina groups; 5 species to the former and 18 to the latter. 

 Kauai, however, does furnish a very peculiar and interesting group 

 of large terrestrial shells, remarkable for their elongate turretted 

 form. The generic name of Carelia has been provided for the group; 




22 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



it embraces some seven species. Specimens of Carelia turricula 

 Migh. in my cabinet measure three inches long. This group has no 

 place in the Achatinella family, as classed by M. Gulick. It lacks 

 the peculiar spiral twist of the columella and other generic charac- 

 ters of that family ; living specimens of Carelia are now very 

 rare, but at some period in the history of Kauai they were exceed- 

 ingly abundant. The alluvial deposits near the coast portions of 

 the island, contain multitudes of these shells in a semi-fossil state, 

 which have been washed from the mountains by the freshets of ages 

 past. The small neighboring island of Niihau also has a single 

 species of Carelia found in sand and mud deposits ; no living speci- 

 mens are found there now." 



" Hawaii. This island embraces within its bounds two-thirds of 

 the total area of the whole group. It is also supposed to be the most 

 recently formed of the islands. The volcanic forces are still at work 

 here. The extensive forests are as well adapted for the support of 

 Achatinella, as those of any of the other islands, but it furnishes 

 only a single arboreal species, and five terrestrial. The arboreal 

 species is A. physa; it was first described by Dr. Newcomb in the 

 Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London in 1853. In a sub- 

 sequent number of the same Journal, Mr. Wm. H. Pease refers to 

 this same shell as a "species rarely met with on the mountains of 

 Hawaii." The centre of production is the Kohala range of moun- 

 tains, notably the most ancient portion of the island ; and it exists 

 there now in unparalled abundance. During a recent visit to the lo- 

 cality in a few minutes I collected several hundred specimens, picking 

 them from trees and low bushes as rapidly as one would gather huckle- 

 berries from a prolific field. The shell appears to be slowly migra- 

 ting into the adjoining districts of Haraakua and Kona, and assu- 

 ming new shapes and varieties of coloring. One of these varieties 

 in our cabinet is almost worthy of assignment as a new species. The 

 conchologist of a few centuries hence will no doubt be naming A chati- 

 nella from the different districts of Hawaii of manifold forms and 

 gaudy colors, which have developed through the mysterious pro- 

 cessses of evolution from the humble A. physa of the Kohala Moun- 

 tains." 



" The discovery of so large a number of land shells of the same 

 genus within limited island areas Avas unprecedented, and at once 

 induced the belief that the "completion of a collection of the genus 

 had been sealed," this is a mistake. The homes of Achatinella 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 2,^ 



are on rugged mountains, densely covered by vegetation and their 

 sides furrowed by deep and almost inaccessible ravines and large 

 districts on Oahu and East Maui which have never been visited by 

 white men, remain yet to be explored. It will require years of re- 

 search and study, before the number and exact distribution of the 

 remaining species can be ascertained. It is also generally supposed 

 that these shells are becoming extinct by the ravages of cattle through 

 our forests. This is true in respect to a limited number of species 

 on the island of Oahu whose habitats were the forests on the lowest 

 range of hills. Some of these hills have been denuded of woods, not 

 only by cattle, but the woodman's axe, and certain species are be- 

 coming rare. The favorite resorts of many species are the Ki {Dra- 

 cena terminalis) and the Olona (Boehmeria stipularis) both excellent 

 fodder plants. But in localities where these plants have been entirely 

 destroyed by cattle, the shells have generally selected homes on other 

 adjoining plants. The ravages particularly of wild cattle in our 

 mountain forests are certainly to be deprecated, nevertheless by 

 clearing the under brush they render the forests more accessible for 

 the collection of known species ; and by opening the paths to higher 

 and more dense forests they facilitate the discovery of new species. 

 The agencies now threatening the wholesale destruction of these little 

 gems of the forest are the rats and mice, which have become very 

 abundant in mountain forests, particularly where there are no cattle. 

 Their ravages are not confined to the shells whose habitats are on the 

 ground, but extend to those found on trees. It is not uncommon to 

 find around the charnal cells of these noxious little animals hundreds 

 of empty, mutilated shells. Notwithstanding these threatening agen- 

 cies, the Achatinellse are still quite abundant on Oahu and Molokai, 

 where cattle have the widest range, though not so abundant as for- 

 merly on West Maui Avhere the cattle ranges are somewhat limited 

 and the mice enjoy greater immunity. In a recent excursion with 

 a friend through a portion of the mountain forests between Ewa and 

 Waialuaou Oahu more than 3000 shells were collected in a few days 

 embracing over fifty species of Achatinella, some of them new to 

 science. In a similar trip around Molokai nearly 5000 were collec- 

 ted, embracing thirty species, some new."^ 



To Wesley Newcomb, M. D. more than to any author on Achati- 

 nella, we are indebted for a correct knowledge of the described spe- 

 cies of this beautiful genus of shells. During a residence of nine 



1 Mr. D. D. Baldwin in Hawaian Almanac and Annual. 




24 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



years in the Sandwich Islands he collected and reared large numbers 

 of the different species and observed the numerous varieties from a 

 common parentage. When in Europe in company with the late 

 Dr. A. A. Gould he examined the types of Dr. L. PfeifFer and others 

 which enabled him to correct the synonymy of many doubtful spe- 

 cies ; all of which he has embodied in his Synopsis of the Genus, 

 which entitles him to the designation of authority on Achatinella 

 " par excellence." 



For convenience of reference I have arranged the species alpha- 

 betically under the several sections, rather than in a connected series, 

 as was attempted by Mr. Pease. The sections of Achatinellse being 

 more or less artificial, authors are not always in accord as to which 

 certain species should be assigned. In the majority of instances, I 

 have followed Dr. Pfeiffer or Mr. Pease in the distribution of the 

 species among the sections, being guided in the main by authentic 

 examples, or by figures and descriptions of authors; the sub-section 

 Helicterina adopted by Mr. Pease from Baron Ferussac, has been 

 supplanted by Partulina, the former having been preoccupied. 



In the preparation of this paper I am indebted for aid to several 

 friends. To Prof. A. Agassiz for the loan of the entire Pease collec- 

 tion of Achatinella together with all his duplicates amounting to 

 near two bushels of examples, I have had in my possession several 

 entire suites of Achatinellie, kindly loaned to me by Prof. James Hall, 

 Dr. Lea, JNIrs. George Andrews and Mr. R. Ellsworth Call, by which 

 I was enabled to identify types from authors hands. Recently, at 

 the invitation of Dr. Newcomb I spent the greater part of two days 

 in the examination of his collection of Achatinella made some years 

 ago in the Sandwich Islands. My acknowledgements are also due him 

 for assistance in the determination of many varieties. When in 

 Europe in 1883 I purchased some of the species of Messrs Gulick and 

 Smith from G. B. Sowerby Jr. Recently I have been favored by 

 Mr. D. D. Baldwin of the island of Maui with written catalogues of 

 the localities of the Achatinellse of the Sandwich Islands, together 

 with numerous examples of Achatinella and especially with spec- 

 imens taken from the determined type examples of Mr. Gulick, in 

 the Hawaian Museum. The geographical distribution of the Acha- 

 tinellse in those islands together with their habits, which has been 

 embodied in this paper was expressly prepared by Mr. Baldwin for 

 the Hawaian Almanac and Annual. I am also under obligations 

 to Mr. Geo. W. Tryon Jr., for his uniform courtesy in aiding me in

 of Natural Sciences.

 Section APEX, ® Albers.-1860. 



*T'he species of the Section Apex, are involved in almost inextricable confusion. 

 Autlicrs in many instances, have not given the localities of the species, and the 

 great vmiaiiility ni size and color of many species, added to the many intermediate 

 vaiieiie^, entails an almost endless task to separate them. To arrive at a certainty, 

 the C(.l()r of the animal and mantel must be observed, and local suites should be 

 collt-cted liy vvhicii critical comparisons could be instituted. It is to be regretted, 

 that si)ecies have been multiplied on slight grounds. In my endeavours to arrive 

 at a correct synonymy, I may have erred by restricting the species within too 

 narrow limits, wliicli wdl be for future observers to correct. The Section Apex 

 exhiliits four prevailing types, as illu■^lrated by the '?.\^iQ\ii% turgiiia,inustellina, per- 

 versa and Swijtii, from which all others seem but modifications.

February 7. 

 Mr. Thomas Meehan, Vice-President, in the chair. 



Twenty-four persons present. 



The death of Geo. W. Tryon, Jr. on the 5th inst. having been 

 announced the following minute was adopted: — 



While this may not be the time to fully set forth the services 

 which have been rendered to this Academy and to the scientific 

 world by our departed member Geo. W. Tryon, Jr., yet it is fitting 

 that the sad announcement of his death should be followed by im- 

 mediate though brief expression of our sorrow. — Therefore be it 



Resolved — That by the death of Mr. Tryon, the Academy of 

 Natural Sciences of Philadelphia is bereft of one of its most faithful 

 and useful workers — one whose devotion to the interests of the in- 

 stitution has been proven during nearly thirty years in varied and 

 responsible positions of trust, by repeated and generous gifts, and 

 above all, by untiring labor for its advancement ; and whose earnest- 

 ness and assiduity in his chosen field of study have been rewarded 

 Avith a well-earned celebrity which will forever connect his name 

 Avith the history and progress of conchological science. 



Resolved — That we are enabled by our own knowledge of his 

 kindly, helpful and endearing qualities to sympathize heartily with 

 his family in their irreparable loss. 



Dr. W. S. W. Ruschenberger was appointed to prepare a bio- 

 graphical notice of Mr. Tryon for publication in the Proceedings. 



Februry 13, 



Meeting of the Botanical Section. 



The Director, Dr. W. S. W. Ruschenberger, in the chair. 



The death of Dr. Asa Gray, on January 30, was announced and 

 the following minute which had been adopted by the Academy at 

 the meeting held February 7, was read : — 



The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia has learned 

 with deep sorrow of the death of Professor Asa Gray of Cambridge, 

 Massachusetts, who was elected a correspondent in 1836. In plac- 

 ing this record in our Proceedings we are unable to give adequate 

 expression to our sense of the great loss which we, in common with 

 5 




58 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



the whole world of science, have sustained. A life extending to nearly 

 four score years has been wholly devoted to scientific investigation, 

 mainly in his chosen department of Botany, in which his labors and 

 philosophic insight have been attended with results that do honor 

 to him and to his country. In entering upon the study of the flora 

 of his native land, he early realized the imperfect character of its 

 existing literature and turned his attention to the examination of 

 the original tyjfes of various authors as found in the herbaria of 

 North America and Europe. His ultimate object seems to have 

 been the production of a complete flora of North America, which, 

 though he lived to see far advanced, he was not permitted to 

 entirely finish. 



In the course of his studies his far reaching mind found deep in- 

 terest in the difficult questions pertaining to the geographical dis- 

 tribution of plants, and he was led to the discovery of the remarkable 

 analogies between the flora of the Eastern United States and that of 

 Eastern Asia. His reasoning upon this and kindred subjects pre- 

 pared his mind to give respectful attention to the deductions made 

 by Darwin, when they were first published, and though never a 

 blind follower, he was one of the earliest scientists of our land to 

 uphold the idea of progressive development, always maintaining its 

 perfect harmony with theistic belief Thus his labors in the botanical 

 field have been utilized for the entire scientific world. 



His interest in this Academy never abated ; our library bears 

 abundant evidence of his researches ; our herbarium has been great- 

 ly enhanced in value by his studies of its types, and by his generous 

 contributions; whilst his kind, genial and attractive presence at 

 many of our meetings has endeared him to us all. — Therefore be it 



Resolved — That this expression of our sorrow be communicated to 

 his immediate family with the assurance of our deep sympathy with 

 them in a loss which is so widely felt. 



Resolved — That this record be entered in full upon our minutes 

 and published in the Proceedings. 



Mr. Redfield ofiered at the meeting of the Section, the following 

 preamble and resolutions which were unanimously adopted: — 



When in due course of nature a man eminent in his calling, con- 

 spicuous as a large minded citizen and remarkable for his private 

 virtues is taken from us it is a duty which his colleagues owe, not 

 only to the memory of the departed, but to themselves that they 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 59 



should recognize by public expression the value of so distinguished 

 a life to the times in which it was cast: — Therefore be it i-esolved, — 



1st. That in the death of Professor Asa Gray, the Botanical 

 Section of frhe Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia recogni- 

 zes the removal of one who stood without a rival in his chosen field. 

 The magnitude of his work, the industry and ability with which 

 it was executed, the clearness of insight, the truthfulness and accu- 

 racy displayed in all that he undertook, have done more to elucidate 

 the flora of North America, than the labors of any of his predeces- 

 sors or cotemporaries. 



2nd. That we desire hex'e to recoixl the fact, that as he was ever 

 ready to aid his co-workers however humble, by his extensive know- 

 ledge, his removal is deplored as a loss to the whole scientific com- 

 munity. 



3rd. That while his great intellectual attainments were combined 

 with the charms of a pure life, a warm heart and a charitable dis- 

 position which gave a rare loveliness to his whole character, — there 

 were also added an inflexible purpose, an unyielding devotion to duty, 

 and an allegiance to all right principle. 



4th. That we will cherish his memory, and endeavor to follow 

 the spirit and purpose of his life in science, by fostering that frater- 

 nal feeling which he did so nuich to create among the botanists of 

 our country. 



5th. That while we trust that his removal hence is but the en- 

 trance upon a nobler field of action, we desire to offer to Mrs. Gray 

 and to other relatives our most profound sympathy in their be- 

 reavement. 



6th. That these resolutions be entered in full upon the minutes 

 of the Section, be printed in the Proceedings of the Academy, and 

 that a copy of them be transmitted to Mrs. Gray. 



Mr. Wsi. M. Canby in seconding the resolutions said: — 

 One of the most remarkable men of our country and, as a scientist, 

 the best known and most esteemed abroad of any American of our 

 day, has passed from among us. The early advantages of Asa 

 Gray were not many. He was not a college-bred man in the ordi- 

 nary acceptation of the term and his rise was due to his own genius 

 and energy. It falls to me to-night to speak of him as a systematic 

 botanist. It is difficult for our younger botanists to aomprehend the 

 low state of the science when Dr. Gray first became interested in it. 

 Nothing of any moment had as yet been done except in systematic 




60 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888- 



botany. True there had been good workers in this department, 

 and the labors of Bartrani and Marshall, of Waher and Michaux, 

 of Muhlenberg and Elliott, of Schweinitz, Pursh, Nuttall and others, 

 have always been highly esteemed. Many foreign botanists, from 

 the time of Linnseus onward, had described American species. The 

 labors of these had laid a foundation for North American botany.. 

 But many of the descriptions were in diverse and scattered publica- 

 tions and were often incomplete or faulty. The synonymy had become 

 much confused. Vast regions now well known, were then terrs& 

 incognitoe. Even the flora of so near a district as the pine land& 

 of New Jersey was almost unknown. 



Nothing daunted, the young botanist, encouraged by the late Dr. 

 Beck of Albany and yet more by his life-long friend and associate 

 Dr. Torrey, gave up the practice of medicine and devoted his whole 

 time to his favorite science. So far as I know he was the first 

 American to fully do this. Almost at once the effect of his careful 

 and excellent labor began to appear and much preliminary work 

 was soon done. Dr. Torrey had seen the manifest need of a new and 

 better "Flora of North America." Here was one who could not 

 only assist him but take the main burden of the work ; and soon the 

 now classic "Torrey and Gray's Flora" began to appear. Any one 

 familiar with this work must have noticed how rapidly the descrip- 

 tions improved as the work went on, and what a vast amount of new 

 material the collections of Nuttall, Fremont, James and other explor- 

 ers of our western Territories brought into it. While the species- 

 were thus well studied and the new ones admirably described, the 

 fullest and most generous credit was always given to the discoveries 

 and labors of others. But collections of the plants of the great 

 western regions, from public and private sources, began to come, in 

 most embarrassing richness. It became evident that the further 

 publishing of the "Flora" must be delayed until the floral wealth of 

 the great interior could be better known. It was also necessary that 

 the synonymy of the earlier described species should be settled. So, 

 for a brief period. Dr. Gray studied these in European herbaria and 

 gardens. Twice afterward he made similar studies with most im- 

 portant results. Soon after his return from his first visit abroad, 

 came the call to Cambridge and his settlement at the Botanic 

 Garden there. From this time onward he stood in the very front 

 rank as a botanist. His energy and industry were unceasing, and 

 his work, by no means confined to systematic botany or to the plants 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 61 



of our own country, went forward rapidly and well. Less than a 

 year ago I was told by the Governor of the Fiji Islands that Dr. 

 Gray's work upon the flora of those distant lands was still the foun- 

 dation of their systematic botany. His researches into the flora of 

 Japan and China are well known. Soon the "Manual of Botany" 

 appeared with its excellent arrangement and its clear and accurate 

 idescriptions. Who can measure the influence of that work upon 

 the botany of our country or the effect it has had to create and 

 increase an interest in the science. At last, after an amount of 

 well directed labor and research which could have been applied 

 by no other man, and after rery many "contributions" of new species 

 and "monographs" of difficult and little known genera had come 

 from his pen, the time seemed ripe for a real and comparatively 

 complete "Flora of North America" to appear. We all know how 

 two volumes of this were issued and, in a second edition, extended 

 and improved ; and how fondly we had hoped, knowing how un- 

 impaired was his mental and physical vigor, that the whole might 

 have been finished before death claimed him. This was not to be; 

 but we can never be suflSciently thankful that so much which he 

 .alone could give was made free to all. 



What estimate shall we place upon his work in this department 

 of the science? None but the very highest would be just. To me 

 it seems as if the systematic botany of our country owes nearly every 

 thing to Dr. Gray. Much that he did not do personally ^ivas done 

 under his eye or by his advice and approbation. He it was who 

 brought order out of confusion and having made stable and secure 

 the foundation of this branch of the science, erected thereon a ^oble 

 ■edifice which his tireless energy well nigh completed. 



But no man could have done this who was less richly gifted than 

 Asa Gray, for he had that clear insight and prescience which is 

 genius rather than talent. In him, with eminent ability to detect 

 the relations of genera and species, were combined a rare faculty of 

 ■conveying his own knowledge to others by felicitous and accurate 

 description, and the conscientious truthfulness which would allow 

 no work to be carelessly or incompletely done. 



Would that it were my place also to bear testimony to his great- 

 ness of soul. But this I must leave to others, — only saying, what 

 all will recognize as true, that in the death of Dr. Gray we have, 

 in the largest sense, lost the best as well as the greatest of American 

 botanists. 




62 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



Prof. J. T. RoTHROCK then said : — 



I desire here to speak of Asa Gray simply as a teacher, and shall 

 not allude to his rich and rounded career in any other relation^ 

 except so far as may be required to bring out the teacher more fully. 

 His work as a systematist will receive fuller and better consideration 

 from others, than I could hope to give it. 



Directly or indirectly almost all the botanical teachers and in- 

 vestigators of this country owed their training, or their inspiration 

 to Professor Asa Gray. If they had not been directly trained under 

 his eye, they were at least taught by those who had been, or had 

 used the text-books prepared by him for the special purpose of 

 diffusing a popular knowledge of botany. Two of his least preten- 

 tious books, — "How Plants Grow" and "How Plants Behave" are 

 veritable missionaries which daily impart some worthy lesson to 

 thousands of children all over the land. We can hardly think of 

 a time when the.se books will cease to be read, or to be popular. 



In each generation there are a few men to whom "the Avorld owes 

 its most notable impulses." One may well say that the life and 

 labors of Charles Darwin illustrate this statement fully ; and with 

 equal propriety we may claim, that so far as our own country is con- 

 cerned, the teaching and example of Asa Gray were^no less note- 

 worthy. 



There comes a time in the history of almost every ambitious youthr 

 bent upc»i an intellectual life, when he is called upon to decide what 

 special career he will select. His earliest ambition to become a master 

 in the whole realm of knowledge is found to be worse than a dream. 

 His first intention was to have devoted a year to one celebrated in- 

 structor and another year to a second, and so on, until he should lay 

 the broad and solid foundation upon which his great learning and 

 reputation might rest. I have known such ambitious students, and 

 I have known them to become pupils of Professor Gray, with the 

 full intention of leaving him at the end of a year or two, to seek 

 instruction in another department of Science, from another teacher: 

 but of that number, very few ever completed their proposed course of 

 study. The charm of Professor Gray's manner, his kindness of 

 heart, no less than the constantly widening views which unfolded 

 under his instruction, wedded them to botany for life. Yet I 

 never knew him to say, or even intimate, that one should elect his 

 branch over anothers. There have been students to whom botany 

 was far from a favorite branch, but in less than six months, the 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 63 



great, warm-hearted teacher had Avon the pupil to himself and to 

 botany forever. Had Asa Gray been a man of but medium attain- 

 ments, his transparent and unselfish goodness would alone have 

 made him a model teacher, whose example and whose memory a 

 student must have revered to the end. 



Yet of all this personal power which Gray the teacher wielded, not 

 a trace was due to toleration of half done work. On the contrary 

 if he had a characteristic which absolutely predominated, it was 

 thoroughness. Not once in years did I ever know him to rest satis- 

 fied until he had obtained from a pupil the best results possible 

 under the circumstances. From the outset he not only encouraged, 

 but required a student to see, think and conclude for himself: often 

 without aid from books and always without tuxnecessary aid from 

 him. This may appear to many as harsh treatment, but systems of 

 teaching can only be judged by their result, and in this light Pro- 

 fessor Gray's method stands abundantly vindicated. How w^retched 

 the system of education which "crams" a lad with facts and leaves him 

 imable to stand alone when beyond the authority of the preceptor. 

 To the fullest extent Doctor Gray recognized this, and to prevent 

 such a result insisted on mental discipline which left the student 

 with a w'ell-grounded confidence in his own pow'ers. But on the 

 other hand a student never could learn presumptuous trust from a 

 teacher wdio had nothing of the kind i)imself Those who received 

 from Professor Gray the largest share of judicious "letting alone" 

 were the ones disposed to hunt an easy solution to their problems. 

 It was never enough to simply reach a result in work. His common 

 custom was to question and cross question until there could be no 

 doubt in the mind of either teacher or taught, that the result was 

 fairly obtained. Often the conclusion of the student Avas treated as 

 a thesis to be sustained. 



Dr. Gray not seldom assigned to his advanced students, subjects 

 for original investigation and of course required a Avritten report, 

 often for publication. Nothing shoAvs more clearly his conscien- 

 tiousness as a teacher than his strictness concerning these reports. 

 It Avas not sufficient that the conclusions should be correct,'but they 

 must be stated in exactly the right way. An artistic turn of a sen- 

 tence, making it graceful as avcII as logical, Avas in his eyes of the 

 utmost importance. "There now, that is neatly stated," is an ex- 

 pression Avhich yet rings in my ears. It Avas uttered by Doctor 

 Gray, when at last I had succeeded in "putting a point" as he thought 




6-4 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



it should be. I had written my first scientific paper at least six times, 

 and each time thought it was as well done as could be; certainly as 

 well done as I was capable of doing it. But my critic Avas merciless. 

 I mentally resolved each time, that I would not re-write it; but I 

 did re-write it ; and was obliged to continue doing so until he thought 

 it might be allowed to pass. I can see now the benefit of all that 

 criticism. It was the most helpful lesson I ever received in the art 

 of stating things. How much easier it would have been for Professor 

 Gray to have made a mere perfunctory criticism, and then allowed 

 the paper to have gone, with the statement, — it will do, but it should 

 have been better! The fact that he did not do so, however, is just 

 the point that I desire to bring out in illustration of his conscientious 

 discharge of duty. I have no doubt he sighed more over having to 

 take time to re-read it, than I did over having to re-write it. But, 

 though to him lost time, he was good enough to regard it as a duty, 

 and as such he did it. His character as a teacher came out in the 

 fact that he did not allow it to pass. It was this disregard of his 

 own time when a duty to a student was apparent, which places him 

 now so high in the esteem of scores of pupils. 



During working hours Professor Gray would allow no talking for 

 talk-sake, at least but for a moment. He would, however, volunteer a 

 hint, to place a student on the track in a difficult problem, or if 

 necessary he would cheerfully give an hour for the same purpose, 

 though he would not reveal anything which it were better that the 

 student should discover for himself. 



So far as I am aware he never forgot or lost interest in any one 

 whom he had instructed. This is certainly true of those who had 

 spent any considerable period with him. Time and time again, 

 have I known him to be on the watch for a chance to help a student 

 make an honorable name. Is it strange then that all over the land 

 there are those who have heart aches when it is remembered we 

 shall see that loved teacher no more? 



When a great, good leader has been taken it hardly alters the 

 case that he went full of years and honor. AVe are even then not 

 ready to spare him. We never would have been ready to spare 

 Asa Gray. 



Each year the aspect of a science changes and some new phase 

 becomes the popular one: and this for the time being is apt to be re- 

 garded, as, if not the whole, then at least as the better or the major 

 part of the science. It is simply the expression of an old human 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 65 



weakness, which tries to make a part appear greater than the whole 

 of a thing. An individual of great force of character, may if he 

 desires, impress his associates with an idea of the supreme impor- 

 tance of his particular, partial line of study. But after all we only 

 discover the solid bulk of anything when it is viewed from all sides. 

 This is intended to bear especially upon the fact that Professor 

 Gray's teaching lay mainly, but by no means exclusively in the line 

 of systematic botany. Just now there is a decided tendency to give 

 more attention to morphological and physiological botany than ever 

 before, which is right ; and to discourage systematic botany, which 

 is wrong. It is merely a temporary swing of the pendulum. Gravity 

 will at length place all these lines of botanical thought, as they de- 

 serve to be, on an even plane. It should, however, be said that those 

 who disparage the systematic side to wdiich Doctor Gray leaned, and 

 on Avhich he mainly taught, have as a rule had so little training in 

 it, that they fail to comprehend its full meaning. Even mere analy- 

 sis of a plant may, nay must, if properly taught, indicate beside the 

 name, those broader relationships which express, or suggest the lines 

 of descent by which the plant has come down to us. If it is a grand 

 study, and it surely is, to follow the development of the individual 

 from the egg or cell to the adult condition, is it not a nuich grander 

 and broader problem to follow the evolution of the species or the 

 genus ? 



Further, it should be stated that Professor Gray's w^ork and teach- 

 ing was directly in the natural sequence of events. Above all, it is 

 to be remembered that the most timely work is always the most 

 valuable. The first, most pressing task in the botany of any country 

 is to correctly name and arrange its plants. This is a pre-requisite 

 condition upon which the record of all other botanical studies then, 

 and the diffusion of all knowledge thence, must rest. J t was to the 

 completion of this great, this necessary work that Professor Gray 

 was bending all his strength. 



It is well, however, to come to the clear statement, that no one in 

 America, and but very few in Europe were so fully and practically 

 acquainted with the latest thought and latest observations in all de- 

 partments of botany as was the subject of this sketch. He could 

 discuss just as clearly the functions of chlorophyll, or the dual nature 

 of lichens, or the relation of a plant to its environment, as he could 

 the relation of one American species to another, or of an Eastern 

 United States plant to one from far away Japan. Let it then be

stated, that judged by the broadest standard, as a teacher, Asa Gray 

 stood perfectly roimded in liis knowledge. If any one can doubt 

 this, let liim but read the critical reviews which during the past 

 twenty years Professor Gray has Avritten for the American Journal 

 of Science, and be convinced. Indeed the wide range of his exact 

 knowledge was wonderful. But vast as were his attainments, and 

 vast as was the sum of all that he has written, his strongest claim to 

 a perpetual remembrance does not rest there. His was the task of 

 starting a generation of teachers in the right direction. True, the 

 times were ripe for the coming of Professor Gray ; but how much 

 more meagre the harvest would have been if he had not come I 

 Certainly it could not have been what his care and culture have 

 made it! It is a great thing to write a good book. It is a greater 

 thing to write a clearer book for a country than had been produced 

 before. But it was greatest of all, to take the young, ambitious na- 

 turalists of this growing and educationally immature country and 

 teach them how to teach others, not only as to facts, but as to 

 methods. The value of this labor passes comprehension, for its 

 ultimate effects ever widening, reach far out into the future. Facts 

 may be lost sight of, theories disproven, hypotheses rejected as insuffi- 

 cient, but men w'ill henceforth never lose a key which unlocks 

 realms of knowledge. Asa Gray's whole life as teacher and as inves- 

 tigator has been the model of a master key. Those who have his 

 patience, his honesty, his genial faith in his associates will best un- 

 lock the secrets of our flora so long as any remain unrevealed. 



Think of him in what relation we may, he stands out in strong 

 light for inspection, the picture of a "manly man.'' Was he with- 

 out fear? It was because he Avas without reproach. If to the 

 last, his cheerfulness and mental buoyancy amazed even those who 

 knew' him best, it was because the elasticity of his love of God and 

 man enabled him to reach beyond the limits wliich age usually im- 

 poses, clear into the sunlight of eternal youth. 



Asa Gray has gone to his rest. AVe mourn his removal from our 

 midst : but we are thankful for the honor he ctist upon this land, 

 throughout the length and breadth of which his name is revered. 

 More than this, we his associates and pupils are especially grateful 

 for the example of kindness and conscientious devotion which he 

 has left us ; as well as for the methods of study which he inculcated 

 and so well illustrated in his own daily life and labor. 




1888.] NATURAL SCTEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 67 



Prof. W. P. Wilson said :— 



I wish to offer a few words on the relation sustained bv Dr. Asa 

 Gray to the various leading scientific societies and naturalists of the 

 old world. I do this all the more gladly because like some others 

 of our true scientific men he was known better abroad than in hi& 

 own land. I do not wish to say that Dr. Gray was not well known 

 at home, for he was. His series of text-books, eight in all, has in- 

 troduced his name wherever botany is well taught, but had his 

 celebrity in this country depended on his scientific papers and books 

 not intended for the general reader, he might have been almost as 

 unknown to the masses as Jeffries Wyman, Avho wrote no text-books 

 but made some very important additions to science and consequently 

 was much better known in England and on the Continent than here. 

 In this country, to the great majority of individuals who had seen or 

 heard of Dr. Gray, his name was inseparably connected with the finest 

 set of text books ever issued in the English language. Onlv a few 

 botanists and friends knew of his incessant labor on original ques- 

 tions, and that the results of this work were frequently published in 

 the proceedings of the different societies. It was this latter kind of 

 Avork which rapidly gained for him abroad a great recognition. 



While Dr. Gray in his early career labored incessantly at his 

 chosen work, went on numerous collecting tours, prepared important 

 papers on the Grasses and Sedges, gave lectures on botany in two or 

 three schools and colleges, published several minor papers in differ- 

 ent societies and made himself indispensable in the early work of the 

 Flora of North America which Dr. Torrey had already begun — he 

 was known only to a very limited circle at home. 



This activity, accuracy and ability in botany had already made 

 him through his collecting and papers quite a reputation abroad and 

 had as early as 1836 secured for him membership in three foreign 

 societies: The Royal Academy of Sciences of Stockholm in 1S29, 

 the Imperial Academy Natur?e Curiosorura, Warsaw, 1885, and the 

 Royal Botanical Society of Regensburg (Ratisbon) 18o(). 



Dr. Gray's visits to Europe Avere in all six. He first went for 

 botanical study in November 1838, returning in the November or 

 the following year. The j^rogress of the North American Flora re- 

 quired the study and comparison of the many collections which in 

 earlier times had been sent over from America to the European 

 herbaria. 




68 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP , [1888. 



In Glasgow he was the guest of Dr. W. J. Hooker. Among those 

 whom he met in England at this time were George Bentham, Robt. 

 Brown, Balfour, Lindley, Boott, Bauer, Lambert, Greville and a 

 score of others. Upon finishing his work in England he went to 

 the Continent pushing his undertaking with great vigor. In the 

 course of his extended tour he visited Paris, Lyons, Vienna, Munich, 

 Geneva, Halle, Berlin, Hamburg and other cities, and made the ac- 

 quaintance of such men as Jussieu, Brongniart, Decaisne, Mirbel, 

 Adrien, Gaudichaud, Gay, Delile, Duval, Eudlicher, von Martins, 

 Zuccarini, the De Candolles, Ehrenberg, Schlechtendal, Klotzsch, 

 Kunth, Link, Lehmann and many more. 



It will be seen that in this, his first visit to Europe, he made the 

 acquaintance of many botanists already eminent, and others who 

 like himself were later to become so. This was one of the most im- 

 portant years in his life. Acquaintances were made which were 

 life-long ; correspondences were opened and exchanges of plants 

 and works begun which were alike helpful to all parties. It must 

 be admitted that in America Dr. Gray had no equal, but in 

 Europe there were many who were working on kindred problems 

 and to whom he might turn for scientific companionship. Upon 

 returning home he prosecuted the work on the " Flora" with his ac- 

 customed energy and by the spring of 1841 had issued the first 184 

 pages of Vol. II. 



Passing over ten years of hard work in collecting, writing and 

 teaching at Cambridge, we find him in June of 1850 in a sailing 

 vessel for a second time on his way to Europe. His object now was 

 a study of the plants of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition. 



After travelling in Switzerland, working for a time in DeCandolle's 

 herbarium at Geneva and visiting von Martins at Munich, he went 

 with Mrs. Gray to the country j^lace of Mr. George Bentham in 

 Hertfordshire and spent two months there, going over in company 

 ■with Mr. Bentham, the entire collection which had been sent out 

 from America. 



He next went to Sir Wm. Hooker's house at Kew, London, to 

 study collections there. 



A visit of six weeks to Paris with work in P. Barker Webb's 

 herbarium and at the Jardin des Plantes was followed by nearly 

 four months stay in London with study at the British Museum. 

 Robert Brown was then living. For him Dr. Gray entertained the 

 most profound respect, rating him as he ever after did, as one of the 

 greatest of philosophical botanists. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 69^ 



In 1855 he made his third journey, visiting some of his old friends 

 but remaining from home but six Aveeks. His fourth trip to England 

 and the Continent was made in 1868. Between the years 1855, the 

 date of the last visit, and 1868 much valuable work had been done. 

 He had issued his "Structural and ]\Torphological Botany" which had 

 no rival in America, and no superior in Europe. It was a model 

 of clearness and conciseness in its methods of treating the general 

 morphology of the plant and especially that of the flower. 



The "Manual" had been published and was already recognized as 

 worthy a place by the side of Koch's German Flora. No higher praise 

 could have been given to it. The two Manuals were regarded as 

 models of clearness and brevity in description. 



The work, also that on the Flora of North America, had been con- 

 stantly carried on, besides the publication of various papers on botan- 

 ical subjects, the most important of which was: "Relation of the 

 Japanese Flora to that of North America." This had been a very 

 remarkable piece of work, requiring close reasoning aud comparison, 

 all the more remarkable because the geological and palaeontological 

 work on the fossil flora of the North by Heer had then not been 

 done. The "Principles of Variation in Species" soon to be made 

 known by Charles Darwin's " Origin of Species " was yet unpub- 

 lished. Both of these works might have given great help toward 

 the solution of the problem in hand. It is safe to say that this last 

 work made him known to every active thinker in Europe. 



What wonder is it then, that after the very successful issue of his 

 valuable text-books, after many additions to the North American 

 Flora and the publication of numerous papers including the last one 

 mentioned on geographical distribution, this fourth visit abroad in 

 1868, should have been one continued ovation ? Leaving home in 

 September he spent this and the following autumn at Kew, hard at 

 work. In the interim, visiting Paris, he renewed old acquaintances ,' 

 worked with von Martius in ISIunich and -^ith DeCandolle in Geneva, 

 and visited various herbaria all over the Continent before returning 

 to England. 



Something of the high regard in which his scientific labors were 

 held at this time may be gathered from the fact that when he sailed 

 for home in 1869 he had been made a member of nearly every Royal 

 Scientific Society in Europe. 



He was in Europe twice after this ; first in 1880, remaining about 

 a year. He visited Paris, the Herbarium at Madrid, Spain, most of 




70 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



the Italian herbaria and then settled down at Kew for hard work, 

 receivino: plants for comparison from many of the German and other 

 continental herbaria. Some time was, however, given to the visiting 

 of old friends. 



The last visit to Europe was made in April, 1887, returning in 

 October of same year. A little work was done at Kew, and the 

 Lamarck Herbarium at the Jardin des Plantes was carefully ex- 

 amined. Otherwise the time wa.s devoted to pleasant travel and old 

 friends. Returning in October, he had planned among other work 

 the writing of his Recollections of European Botanists. 



Dr. Gray was known both in England and on the continent not 

 alone as a botanist, but as one of the ablest exponents of evolution. 

 In the early times after the publication of the " Origin of Species " 

 he was its most out-spoken defender in America. His articles at 

 this time were often copied by the English journals. He did not 

 nccept the theory in its entirety. Many letters of Darwin's attest 

 how fully the latter relied on his judgment and support — Darwin 

 says in one of his letters to Dr. Gray "you never touch the subject 

 without making it clearer," " I look at it as even more extraordinary 

 that you never say a word or use an epithet which does not fully ex- 

 press my meaning," "others who perfectly understand my l)Ook, yet 

 sometimes use expressions to which I demur." And again in the 

 same letter he writes " I hope and almost believe that the time will 

 come when you will go further, in believing a much larger amount of 

 modification of species, than you did at first or do now." 



When the history of the development theory is written no small 

 part will be given to him whom we commemorate. 



More than one continental botanist has had reason to venerate 

 our teacher and leader in botany fully as much as Mr. Darwin. 

 His criticism and kindly advice was freely given when asked and 

 often proved invaluable. 



Prof Thomas Meehan remarked that he desired to dwell some- 

 what more fully upon a trait of Dr. Gray's character which the 

 previous speakers had touched only incidentally. The whole world of 

 science owed a debt to Dr. Gray for his botanical labors ; but he was 

 not sure but the greater debt was due to his unpublished work, namely 

 his kind helpfulness to other workers. Many had been made scientific 

 students, many had even become eminent in usefulness, solely by 

 the early encouragement received from Dr. Gray. If he might be- 




1888.] ' NATURAL SCIENCES OF rHILADELPHIA. 71 



pardoned for referring to his own history, he would say that few 

 have had better opportunity of knowing Dr. Gray in this respect 

 than he himself. In 1857, at the instance of a friend he was led to 

 open a correspondence Avith Dr. Gray upon the constant differences 

 between the European and American forms of Spiraea salicifolia. 

 Nothing could be kinder than the reply which urged him to continue 

 his observations, saying that former authors had made the American 

 form a distinct species under the name of S. carpinifolia and that 

 Dr. Gray might proliably adopt this name in the next edition of the 

 Manual. The subsequent appearance of Darwin's "Origin of Species" 

 so changed the hitherto prevailing idea of spe(;ific types that it is 

 no wonder that it did not appear in the next edition under a dis- 

 tinct name. But the encouragement given to the obscure young 

 man was not lost. It led to a closer observation of similar phenom- 

 ena, and the paper on the relative characters of American and Eu- 

 ropean species, which subsequently received the approval of Darwin, 

 Mivart and others, was the result of the encouragement given in that 

 letter. That and many subsequent papers were submitted to Dr. 

 Gray before publication, and not presented without his approval ; 

 and it was not till later, afler he had caught up with the whole lit- 

 erature of the subject, that he ventured to stand alone without the 

 aid of his early friend and monitor. 



Prof Meehan then spoke of his long and frequent correspondence 

 with Dr. Gray, growing out of his own editorial position. From 

 month to month Dr. Gray would send his criticisms upon his edito- 

 rial work. These were occasionally sharp and adverse, but always 

 judicious, encouraging and kind, and Mr. Meehan cited many in- 

 stances illustrative of this. 



It was characteristic of Dr. Gray to give the same attention to the 

 poorest and most obscure, as to the most prominent, if only he found 

 them to be earnest searchers for truth. It had been said that he was 

 hard to convince, but this was because he himself had taken so much 

 pains to reach the truth. Nothing but positive evidence would lead 

 him to set aside a conclusion at which he had arrived ; but when 

 once such evidence was produced, no one accepted it more readily 

 or gracefully, and hence he was even more merciless in judging 

 of his own work, than that of others. Of this readiness to re- 

 verse his own decisions, and do justice to others. Prof Meehan gave 

 many pleasant instances. Few men could have a warmer heart 

 towards friends than Dr. Gray— but this did not lead him to ig- 




72 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



uore their faults, nor prevent him from expressing his views of 

 them. Tender, loving and considerate as he always was, he 

 could be caustic and severe when he believed the good of science 

 demanded it. Once a very zealous collector to Avhom science was 

 under many obligations, described and published a large number of 

 plants, from imperfect material, with undue haste and without com- 

 petent knowledge. Dr. Gray had to show that really there were 

 very few new species among them, and in so doing his criticism Avas 

 unusually severe. Mr. Meehan in writing to Dr. Gray ventured to 

 remonstrate with him upon the severity which he had used. The 

 reply was, " In my heart, I would have been more tender than you, 

 but I cannot afford to be. I am, from my position before the world, 

 a critic, and I cannot shrink from the duty which such a position 

 imposes upon me. If you were in the position that I am, with a 

 short life and a long task before you, and just as you thought the 

 way was clear for progress, some one should dump cart loads of rub- 

 bish in your path, and you had to take off your coat, roll up your 

 sleeves and spend Aveeks in digging that rubbish away before you 

 could proceed, I should not suppose you would be a model of amia- 

 bility." 



In giving these recollections Prof. Meehan hoped that he should 

 be pardoned for so much allusion to his own history, but it was be- 

 cause that history bore such full and rich testimony to the critical 

 acumen, the kind judgment, the friendly aid and the warm and lov- 

 ing heart of the man as well as tlie scientist, Avhom we this evening 

 commemorate. 



Mr. Isaac C. Martindale then spoke of Professor Gray's en- 

 couragement to young students, and of his Avillingness always to aid 

 them in their studies ; this he was able to testify from his own exper- 

 ience, having been again and again assisted while engaged Avith 

 perplexing botanical problems : he also spoke of the genial, kind 

 and social disposition eA^er displayed, and Avhich made the name of 

 Professor Gray a household word in so many homes. He gave an 

 interesting account of a botanical excursion to the mountains of 

 North Carolina made in 1884 in company with this greatest of 

 American botanists, referring to the readiness with which he recalled 

 the names of all the plants met with during the journey, showing 

 not only his perfect familiarity with the names of the species but 

 also his most remarkable memory.

On the resemblance of the primitive foraminifera and of ovarian 

 Ova. — Prof. Ryder remarked that upon cutting sections of nearly 

 mature ovarian ova with their investing membrane, zona radiata, in 

 place, it Avas found that, in quite a number of cases, fine protoplas- 

 mic processes or ])seudopods extended from the peripheral layer of 

 protoplasm of the eg^, through its capsule or zona and joined the 

 cells of the granulosa or discus proligerus. This arrangement re- 

 minded one forcibly of the filamentous pseudopods exteuded from a 

 Heliozoon or of the slender pseudopods extended through the per- 

 forations in the walls of the single chambers of Globigerina. This 

 resemblance was all the more suggestive if one will compare a 

 section of one of the chambers of a Globigerina made through the 

 calcareous shell and its contained protoplasm with a similar section 

 through the ovum of the Gar Pike, where the zona is formed of 

 pillars of homogenous matter. Such prolongations of pseudopods 

 through the investing zona radiata in the case of many species of ani- 

 mal forms, shows fairl}^ well that this must be the principal means 

 by which new matter is taken up from without and incorporated, as 

 there is no direct extension of the vascular system into the egg, by 

 which it can take up nutriment. It is thus seen that the early 

 stages of the growing ovum, not only resemble some of the lower 

 forms of Helizoa and Foraminifera as respects the grade of their 

 morphological differentiation but also as to the mode in which they 

 exhibit their nutritive or physiological activities. This resemblance 

 is still further heightened if a form like Orbulina is comj^ared with 

 certain stages of the development of ova. It is thus seen that, in 

 many cases, the ovarian germ, at least, passes through a stage which 

 may be morphologically as well as physiologically compared with 

 some of the lowest grades of the Protozoa. 



Chaetopterus from Florida : — Prof Leidy directed attention to 

 specimens which were collected in the trip of Prof Heilprin and Mr. 

 Willcox, at the mouth of the ]Manatee River. The species appears 

 to be the Chaetopterus pergamentaceus of Cuvier, originally des- 

 cribed from specimens from the "West Indies. It is a remarkable 

 form. It belongs to the Tubicolae or tube-living worms, but unlike 

 most of these, is devoid of the numerous cephalic appendages, or 

 tentacles and gills. The tube is membranous and laminated in 

 structure and it has the appearance of parchment. The two tubes 

 collected are 16 inches long by Hhs of an inch in diameter, and 

 tapering towards the ends. An incomplete worm, not well preserved 

 on account of its delicacy, in its present condition is 9 inches long,

and appears very narrow in comparison with the capacity of its tube. 

 The anterior division of the body, about an inch long, is flattened, 

 and about half as wide, but narrowing behind, and is composed of 

 eight podal segments provided with dense bunches of lustrous, golden 

 setae. The succeeding segment, long and narrow, is provided with a 

 pair of wing-like appendages an inch long, and each furnished with, 

 two bundles of diverging setae. Then follow five long narrow seg- 

 ments with large membranous appendages, without setae. The 

 terminal segments, of which 15 remain in the specimen, are furnish- 

 ed with pairs of long pointed appendages with bundles of setae.

Necessity for Revising the Nomenclature of American Spiders. — Dr. 

 McCoOK remarked that during the summer of 1887, while visiting 

 the Zoological Library of the British Museum of Natural History, 

 he gained information which may revolutionize, or at least compel 

 a radical revision of the nomenclature of American spiders. 



His interest in these animals being known by some of the zoolo- 

 gists in the room, his attention was called to a volume of unpublished 

 figures of American spiders then in the library. These drawings 

 were made by Mr. John Abbot, an Englishman settled in Savannah 

 during the latter part of the eighteenth century. The figures were 

 made as early as 1792. At least they bear that date. Mr. Abbot 

 is well known to entomologists by his work upon lepidoptera, pub- 

 lished in connection with ]Mr. Smith.' This book proved to be the 

 volumes, long supposed to be lost, of original drawings from which 

 Baron Walckenaer described the numerous species from Georgia 

 which are found in his Natural History of Apterous Insects.^ 



' "The Natural History of the rarer lepidopterous insects of Georgia. Including 

 their systematic characters, the particulars of their several metamorphoses and the 

 plants on which they feed. Collected irom the observations of Mr. John Abbot, 

 many years resident in that country, by James Edward Smith M. D. 2 Vol's, fol. 

 London, 1797."

It was known, of course, from Walckenaer's introduction to his 

 descriptions that he had purchased Abbot's' drawings of over five 

 hundred species of spiders and other arachnids; that he also had the 

 manuscript drawings made by Bosc of South Carolina spiders. But 

 Americans seem to have been in ignorance of what had become of 

 these drawings, and the fact that they were in the Zoological Lib- 

 rary appears to have escaped the observation of the little circle of 

 British students of araneads; at least the speaker could recall no- 

 reference made to them in current literature. It was not until the 

 above incident that an American student was known to have a clew 

 to the whereabouts of the valuable volume which the British Mus- 

 eum is so fortunate as to possess.^ How the book happened to come 

 into its present place, or in what manner it was procured fi'om Baron 

 Walckenaer or his executors, Dr. ^IcCook was not able to say. 



On the day when the discovery was made, he had engagements 

 which prevented him giving more than an hour or two to the study 

 of the figures, and as he was about to leave London, no further oppor- 

 tunity presented for making extended notes. However, he Avas able 

 at once to recognize a number of species which have long and fa- 

 miliarly been known under the names published by Hentz. He took 

 notes of a number of these species, principally among the orbweav- 

 ers, a group with which he was at present particularly engaged. 

 He also took the numbers under which the figures are listed by 

 Abbot. 



After returning to America Dr. McCook went over Walckenaer's 

 descriptions, comparing them with his own notes, and found that 

 there is no doubt at all as to the identity of these drawings with the 

 original ones from which AValckenaer described his published spe- 

 cies. The number of Abbot's figures as they appear in the manu- 

 scripts correspond with the numbers cited by Walckenaer in his 

 references to the same. jSIoreover, Walckenaer's descriptions, view- 

 ed in the light of the speaker's recollection of the drawings, together 

 with his own notes and identification on the spot, remove all doubt 

 as to the identity of at least a considerable number of the species. 



The importance of this discovery is seen in view of the following 

 facts: Walckenaer published his descriptions of Georgia species in 

 1837; Professor Hentz, the father of American Araneology, made 

 his publications in the Proceedings and Journal of the Boston So- 

 ciety of Natural History beginning with the year 1841, and con- 

 tinued until 1850. The latter have been gathered together and 



1 Walckenaer erroneously refers to the author as "Thomas" Abbot; his name is 

 "John."

published in book form under the title of "The Spiders of the United 

 States," edited by Edward Burgess and with notes by Mr. Emerton.^ 



Hentz had some previous papers of no very great consequence, 

 and in 1835 he published a simple list of 125 species arranged under 

 the genera to which he supposed that they belonged. This was in 

 the Second Edition of Hitchcock's Report of the Geology of Massa- 

 chusetts, (1835.) An examination of this list shows that it includes 

 a number of the species which Walckenaer described in 1837 from 

 the drawings of Abbot. So far then as the bare publication of these 

 names is concerned Hentz has a priority of two years. 



The question of priority involved is yet more complicated by the 

 fact that the second volume of Walckenaer's work, containing many 

 of the American species and all the orbweavers, bears a date Avhose 

 integrity is seriously questioned. The title page gives "1837" as the 

 year of publication, the same as that rightly borne by the first vol- 

 ume; but Dr. T. Thorell, Avho is one of the highest living authorities 

 in Araueology, declares that this volume "did not come out till 

 1841."* This fact, however, does not seriously effect the points in 

 issue, as only a few species of the Mygalidae were published by 

 Hentz in 1841;^ all the remaining species were published during 

 and subsequent to 1842. 



The attitude of American students of spider fauna toward Walck- 

 enaer's descriptions alluded to above has been something after the 

 fashionof the famo^is Scotch verdict "not proven." In other words, 

 in the absence of any types or specimens any where existing to which 

 his descriptions might be referred; in the absence of the original 

 drawings from which his descriptions were made, for none (or only 

 one) of them were made from the specimens themselves ; and in the 

 absence of any knowledge as to whether those drawings anywhere 

 existed, it was generally conceded, so far as there was any thought 

 or action on the matter at all, that Walckenaer's descriptions must 

 be considered as non-existent. The priority, therefore, of all the 

 descriptions made by Hentz has been heretofore universally allowed, 

 even though some of Walckenaer's descriptions are sufficiently clear 

 to show without the aid of figures that he had in mind the same 

 species covered under different names by Hentz. Dr. McCook be- 

 lieved that on the whole this decision was a righteous one, and that 

 up to this date no claim could have been established in favor of 

 Walckenaer's priority. 



However, a question now arises which it is necessary to face and

new phase upon the matter? Shall we not be compelled, in view of 

 the fact that there can now be no doubt of the identity of Walcken- 

 aer's species, to give the priority to him ? 



The very few American students of our spider fauna have become 

 so familiar with many of Walckenaer's species under Hentz's names, 

 that it will be diftlcult to throw those names out of mind. Moreover 

 they have entered into all our literature up to this date, and there 

 will be great confusion in making the corrections. Besides, it must 

 be allowed that Hentz's names are better chosen then Walckenaer's. 

 If Abbot, whose patient, long continued and intelligent labors de- 

 serve the real honor, could receive the credit of entitulation, one 

 might, at least on the ground of sentiment, feel more reconciled to 

 seeing the priority pass from Heutz ; especially as Baron Walcken- 

 aer was often indifferent to the prior rights of fellow naturalists. 

 But the laws of priority must be considered, and honesty and justice 

 can give no room for considerations of convenience and sentiment. 



Many of Walckenaer's descriptions may be considered as fairly 

 good, and indeed they have all along been recognized as clearly 

 covering some of Hentz's species. But when those descriptions are 

 placed alongside of Abbot's drawings, from which they were made, 

 all doubt is removed as to the identity. For the most pai-t. Abbot's 

 drawings are tolerably accurate, well finished, are colored after 

 nature, and there was no difficulty at first sight in identifying a 

 large number of our well known species, under the names pul)lished 

 bv Professor Hentz. It seems unfortunate that such good Avork 

 should have remained so long unnoticed, and that credit for the same 

 should have been so Avholly lost to the author. It is at least some 

 satisfaction to be able to render such justice and honor as this notice 

 may bring, to one who l)arely escaped the distinction of being the 

 father of American araneology by inaliility to publish or procure 

 the publication of his faithful laliors. 



There are thus raised very delicate points as to the law of priority, 

 concerning which Dr. ]\[cCook desired to obtain the judgment of his 

 associates: — first, in view of the fact that Walckenaer's species were 

 described not from the spiders themselves, but from the di-awings of 

 them made by another hand, can we be permitted to give priority 

 to Hentz, whose descriptions were made from the animals them- 

 selves? Second, does the fact tliat two years previous to "Walcken- 

 aer's descriptions, Hentz published the names of one hundred and 

 twenty five species, many of which are identical with those of Abbot's 

 drawings and Walckenaer's descriptions, entitle the American au- 

 thor to priority as to these species? Under ordinary circumstances 

 it would perhaps be at once admitted that Hentz could have no 

 claim, but in view of the special circumstances alhided to may there 

 not be some departure from the strict construction of the lex priorita- 

 tisl The inconvenience of overthrowing Hentz's names would be 

 a peculiar hardship to American araneologists, unless the original 

 or a fac-simile of Al)l)ot's Drawings could be obtained and made ac- 

 cessible on this side of the Atlantic. With the book in the British

Museum, there is no final court, before which to test the integrity 

 of species, available for the bulk of American students. While 

 Walckenaer's descriptions are generally intelligible with the draw- 

 ings in hand, many are obscure without them. This is equally true 

 of^Hentz's descriptions; but then we have his figures to interpret the 

 descriptions sufficiently well to enable us to identify the species.* 



Dr. McCook presented a list of a few of the best known species, 

 especially amoug the orb weavers, of tho.se wdiich were recognized 

 by him as identical with the corresi)onding numbers in Abbot's 

 drawings, and which, if Walckenaer's claim to priority be conceded, 

 must hereafter be known under the names assigned by that natural- 

 ist. A reading of this brief list will give araneologists some idea of 

 the serious labor that must be wrought by them before fixed and 

 satisfactory results can be evolved from the confusion into which our 

 existing nomenclature has been startled by the unexpected reappear- 

 ance of Abbot's long lost manuscripts. 



These species are here given in the following tabulated form. 

 The first column shows the name given by Hentz. The second shows 

 Walckenaer's names. The third column gives the names of the 

 :species as thev must hereafter be known if Walckenaer's names are 

 to be accepted.

Cirolana feasting on the Edible Crab. — Prof. Leidy stated that 

 on last Saturday, having occasion to go to Beach Haven, N. J. dur- 

 ing a leisure half hour stroll along shore, he noticed, here and there 

 a dead crab, Callinectes hastatm, lying on the sand, near the last 

 high tide mark. The crabs observed liappened to be all females and 

 they appeared to have died recently as some were quite fresh and 

 showed no signs of decomposition. Others, broken open by remov- 

 ing the carapace, were found to have the body cavity swarming with 

 a living isopod, the Cirolana concharum, which had preyed upon the- 

 organs and were variously colored by the food with which they were- 

 gorged. From a single crab there were taken 108 of the Cirolana 

 ranging from 15 to 22 mm. in length by 5 to 7 mm. in breadth. 



The isojiod is grayish translucent above and whitish translucent 

 beneath, and centrally variously colored, brown, black, red or yellow, 

 from the food contents. The dorsal plates are minutely dotted, black 

 or brown, in bands. The eyes are triangular with rounded angles, 

 and black. The antennae are nearly double the length of the anten- 

 nules. The mandibles are furnished with a strong, brown, tricuspid 

 molar. The caudal plate or telson is triangular with a blunt, slightly 

 emarginate apex and with a pair of spines each side of the latter. 

 The isopod has been observed by Stimpson at Charleston, S. C. and 

 by Harger at Vineyard Sound, ]Ma,ss., but has not previously been 

 reported from the coast of New Jersey. Three isolated specimens 

 of the same were picked up on the shore of Beach Haven, the last 

 summer. 



On Bopyrus palaemoneticola. — Prof Leidy also presented numer- 

 ous specimens of the prawn, Palaemonetes vulgaris, infested with the 

 parasite, Bopyrus palaemoneticola, obtained at Beach Haven, K. J. 

 From about two quarts of the prawn, caught for fish-bait, upwards 

 of fifty contained the Bopyrus.

Twenty-five persons present. 



The death of James S. Mason, a member, was announced. 



Note on Lepas fascicularis. — Prof. Leidy remarked that while 

 stopping at Beach Haven, N. J., the last summer he had observed 

 that from time to time the debris thrown on shore would differ accord- 

 ing to the direction of the wind. On one occasion a strong wind from 

 the north cast up a considerable quantity of material consisting of frag- 

 ments of wood, grass, fucus, etc., to most of which was attached a pro- 

 fusion of goose-barnacles, Lepas fascicularis. Among the materials 

 observed were apples and cranberries, which also had bundles of 

 barnacles attached, and as the fruit was not decomposed, it appar- 




1888.J NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 81 



ently indicated a rapid development and growth of the animaL 

 Portions of apples were exhibited with dense hemispherical groups 

 of attached hai'nacles an inch and a half in diameter with the barna- 

 cles from 2 to 3 lines long, and several cranberries with bunches in 

 which the barnacles are from 2 to 6 lines long. 



Reputed Tape-ivorm in a Cucumber.— Frof. Leidy stated that 

 several years ago, his colleague in the University, Prof. Wm. Goodell,. 

 submitted to his examination a tape-worm, which he received from a 

 correspondent, with the label "From the middle of a cucumber pre- 

 served in brine. S. E. Robinson, West Union, Iowa, May 29, 1876." 

 The specimen appears to be complete and in its present condition, 

 preserved in alcohol, is about eight inches long. The head is large, 

 spheroid, provided with four, small, equi-distant hemispherical both- 

 ria, and surmounted by a prominent crown with a double circle of' 

 strong hooks. The neck is a slight constriction whence the body 

 rapidly widens and again tapers behind. The anterior segments are 

 transversely linear with a gradually increasing length and more 

 acute and prominent lateral ends; the middle segments are about 

 twice the breadth of the length and slightly companulate; and 

 the posterior segments ai'e proportionately longer and narrower. In 

 the latter, the uterus is distended with eggs only at their anterior 

 portion. 



The hooks are partially lost on one side of the crown; and it is 

 estimated that there were about 40 or more. 



The head is '875 mm. broad; the crown of hooks "625 mm.; the 

 neek '8 mm. ; at the middle of the body six segments together are 

 1 cm. long and 3'5 mm. wide ; the terminal segments are about 4 mm. 

 long and 2"5 mm. wide. The eggs measure from '032 to "036 mm. 



While it cannot be admitted that the worm belonged to the cucum- 

 ber, nor is it clear how it reached this position, it is a question as to 

 the species. It bears a near reseml)Iance to the Taenia crassicollis of 

 the Cat, but is not more than half the size of this as it ordinarily 

 occurs. 



In comparison with a complete specimen of the latter, six inches 

 in length in the contracted condition as preserved in alcohol, we find 

 the following measurements.

Diamonds in Meteorites. — Professor Carvill Leavis exhibited a 

 small fragment of a meteorite which had fallen in the district of 

 Krasnoslobodsk, Government of Penza, Siberia, on September 4, 1886, 




■82 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



aud which he had obtained through the kindness of Mr. George F. 

 Kunz. The specimen was of especial interest on account of the re- 

 port (see Nature. Dec. 1, 1887. xxxvii, p. 110) that Professor Lat- 

 chinof and Jero fief had detected in the insoluble residue small cor- 

 puscles having all the characters of diamonds. 



The speaker had extracted from the fragment in his possession 

 two small oval l)odies with extremely high index of refraction and 

 showing only slight traces of polarization, such as is common to 

 many diamonds. They were colorless and transparent, resembling 

 certain specimens of Brazilian "bort." Having been able to dis- 

 tinctly scratch a polished sapphire with portions of the meteorite, he 

 was disposed to agree with Professor Latchinoff and Jerofief that 

 these bodies were true diamonds. The olivine in this meteorite was 

 also in the form of oval grains and had a deep yellow color and 

 bright polarization. The rounded form of the olivine and the dia- 

 monds may have been due to corrosion of the igneous mass. This 

 rounded form is very commonly shown by the olivines in basic erup- 

 tive rocks. 



While diamonds have never before been found in meteorites, cai*- 

 bon has long been known in them in its graphitic or amorphous form. 

 Recently Fletcher '" has descril)ed under the name of Cliftonite a 

 cubical form of carbon, somewhat harder than ordinary graphite, 

 which he found in an Australian meteorite. 



The important l)earing of the present discovery upon the vexed 

 question of the diamond is evident. The speaker had recently en- 

 deavored to sliow that the commonly received notion that itacolumite 

 was the original matrix of the diamond is a mistake, and that dia- 

 monds really occur in, or in the neighborhood of, basic eruptive 

 rocks.^ The facts regarding the a.ssociations of the diamond in 

 Africa, Borneo, New South Wales, California and elsewhere all 

 point to peridotites or allied rocks as the matrix of the diamond. 

 The similarity, both in structure and composition, of the diamond- 

 bearing Kimberlite of South Africa to meteorites had been pointed 

 out by the speaker previously, and he had, in view of this fact, sug- 

 gested the search for diamonds in meteorites. 



Ctenophores in Fresh Water: — Dr. Benjamin Sharp reported 

 that he had observed in a fresh water pond at Sachecha, Nantucket, 

 a great number of Ctenophores, in apparently good condition. This 

 pond is occasionally opened to the sea to allow the escape of the perch 

 that breed there is great numl)ers. The Ctenophores without doubt 

 found their way into the pond at such time. As far as he could de- 

 termine they were the common Mnemiopsis Leidyl, unchanged by 

 their strange environment. They not only appeared perfectly healthy 

 and active but were highly phosphorescent at night. He was not

able to say whether they bred there or not, aud until this is proven 

 it is not possible to say that they have become perfectly adapted to 

 the new condition of life. Many observers have noticed that Coe- 

 lenterata move up rivers, but this is an interesting case, as the transi- 

 ition from the salt to the fresh water must have been very sudden. 

 At the time of observation Dr. Sharp said that on drinking the 

 ■water he could not notice the slightest trace of salt.

THE DISTEIBUTION OF THE COLOR-MARKS OF THE MAMMALIA.i 

 BY HARRISON ALLEN, M. D. 



The variations in the colors of the hair and the skin are of a char- 

 acter and importance which Avarrant a systematic study. I have 

 ventured to formulate my impressions on this subject, and while de- 

 parting in some degree from the directions of approach which zool- 

 ogists have developed, I have not I trust, stated the case without 

 due regard to the views of others on this perplexing phase of obser- 

 vation. 



My main object has been to contemplate color marks as the result 

 of nutritive processes controlled by recognized biological forces both 

 in health and disease. I will not hesitate to treat of a perverted 

 growth in the human subject as comparable to a normal growth in 

 any member of the mammalian series. 



Statements will be made respecting the distribution of colors of 

 hair, (the superficial color, or rather the effect of the main color of 

 the hair upon the eye being here intended) of the colors of pigment 

 marks on the skin, of localized hypertrophies and atrophies, of vi- 

 brissas, of pilosQ and naked warts, as though they were co-ordinates 

 of equal value. 



I have examined the museums at Philadelphia, New York, New- 

 Haven and Washington. I have consulted the illustrations of 

 works on Natural History and have made extended observations on 

 the domesticated animals especially of dogs, horses, cattle, guinea- 

 pigs and rabbits. 



The conclusions drawn at this time have stood the test of repeated 

 re-examinations and while they are nut all suscej^tible of being held 

 as rigid deductions from the premises, they present, I think, a group 

 of tenets which may prove of interest to working zoologists. 



The subject of distribution of the hair in the human subject has 

 received attention from D. F. Eschricht" and C. A. Voigt.^ 



Both writers have taken the new-born child as a standard and 

 have described the directions of the hair in two ways : first as it is 



^ This paper is an elaboration of a portion of an essay which constituted 

 the presidential address at the annual meeting of the American Society of Natural- 

 ists, December, 1887.

observed radiating from certain points, and second as it is seen to 

 converge to certain points. 



The follo^ving are the main points of radiation. The parietal bone, 

 a short distance to the right of the obeleon, and the axilla. The pa- 

 rietal centres may be symmetrical. 



The following are the main points of convergence. The head at 

 the obeleon and directly above the auricle ; the face at the inner end 

 of the eyebrow, and at the root of the nose ; the neck over the cen- 

 tre of the hyoid bone ; the sternum at its upper third ; the abdomen 

 at the summit of the bladder ; the under surface of the penis at the 

 base ; the nape of the neck on each side of the vertebral column ; 

 the trunk over the lower part of the coccyx ; the side of the trunk ; 

 the arm at the insertion of the deltoid muscle ; the elbow at the ob- 

 cranon ; the wrist at the head of the ulna ; the ilium over the ante- 

 rior superior process; the thigh at the lower end of the femoral arterv; 

 and the ham at the inner border. 



It will be found in the course of the ensuing statements that the 

 points of convergences are often found associated with the regions of 

 markings which contrast with the ground-color. Thus the obeleon 

 is the site of brown or black spots in the dog ; in the same animal 

 the tau-colored wart is found in black and tan dogs; the centre of 

 the hyoid bone is also the centre of the gular white or gorget in many 

 carnivorous and quadrumanous animals ; the sternal point is often 

 white in the horse and dog ; the lower end of the back at the sacrum 

 and coccyx is black or brown in ordinarily parti-colored dogs ; the 

 insertion of the deltoid is the low^er end of the epaulette-region which 

 is frequently of a contrasted color to that of the rest of the limb ; the 

 spot over the head of the ulna is in the line of the fringe of the fore- 

 leg in the setter-dog and in some lemui-s. The nape of the neck, the 

 root of the nose, the summit of the bladder, the base of the penis, 

 the olecranon, the anterior prominence of the ilium, the femoral 

 point and the inner border of the ham are not found associated with 

 color-marks. These cannot in turn be entirely separated according 

 to Eschricht from being in the line of union of parts which unite late 

 in the development of the foetus. A complicated disposition at the 

 upper lip is held by the same writer to result from the union of the 

 right and left halves at the median line. Some points, as for exam- 

 ple the olecranon and the iliac process, answer to bony surfaces 

 which are near the skin. The femoral point is also the region at 

 which the long saphenous nerve pierces the fascia. The point on the 




86 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



side of the trunk is associated with the naked trunk surfaces of birdSj, 

 and the colored area in Indrts brevicaudahis. (See infra.) 



In men who are notably hairy (the ca?es of universal hyper- 

 trichosis are not here included) the hair is chiefly developed on the 

 breast and the anterior wall of the abdomen at its upper part,-on the 

 region over the trapezius muscle near the scapula- and on the lower 

 part of the loin and the shoulder. In a number of examinations I 

 have made of hirsute men, I have never found the teeth defective 

 unless a disposition to universal hvpertrichosis was present. This 

 disposition is shown (in addition to the dental defect) by great shag- 

 giness and looseness of contour of the eye-brows. They meet across 

 the inter-orbital space and straggle off" toward the temporal side of 

 the forehead. The best marked of the naked places of the body in 

 the hirsute men are the forehead, and the side of the trunk. Eschricht 

 mentions having found but a single example of the trunk being 

 naked at the side. His observations appear to have been made in 

 Copenhagen and may perhaps exhibit a national peculiarity. In 

 America I am sure such naked places are frequently seen. I can 

 confirm Eshricht's statement that hirsute individuals usually have 

 black hair, are of stalwart build and do not of necessity have strong 

 beards or more than ordinary growths from the head. 



An instructive analogy can be detected to exist between the na- 

 ked surfaces on the sides of the trunk and the great lateral feather- 

 less spaces (apterylia) of most birds. Above I have invited atten- 

 tion to the fact that in Indris brevicaudatus^ the side of the trunk 

 possesses hair of a different color from that covering the ventre or 

 the dorsum. 



The literature of the subject of color-marks is scanty. The papers 

 here given in abstract are of importance. 



Th. Eimer''' believes the striped forms of the mammalia antedated 

 the spotted, and the retention of color obey phylogenetic laws. He 

 traces the markings of Viverra through the varieties of the genus 

 Canis. Faint traces of the transverse marks of Hyena can be detec- 

 ted in the wolf The black spot at the root of the tail is mentioned 

 as occurring in all dogs. The presence of a dorsal stripe is mentioned 

 as being commonly present. In vertebrates generally the posterior 

 parts of the body is more strongly marked than the anterior. This 

 is evident in mammals though less marked than in the lower classes.

The transverse body stripes are the highest form of development of 

 a body-mark, and succeeds in phylogeny the series of dotted-marks. 

 This order is the reverse of that suggested by Darwin. A paper by 

 G. T. Rope' describes two varieties of coloring in the English form 

 of the domestic cat viz : transverse stripes or rows of dots on a white 

 ground and Avhite markings of a more or less longitudinal direction 

 on a black ground. 



The following list includes the arrangement of the subject-matter 

 of the present essay. 



1. The "break" from the prevailing or ground color compared 

 with the positions at which hair is retained in nearly hairless animals. 



2. Brindles. 



3. The regions in which color-marks are found regularly disposed. 

 These are : the dorsal line of the trunk ; the back of the neck ; the 

 the dorsi-facial line ; the ventre and limbs ; the ulnar border of the 

 foreleg ; the axilla and pudenda ; the "collar;" the regions of the spe- 

 cial senses ; the sides of the body ; the regions of nerve-endings ; 

 muscle-regions ; regions which are rich in seba and moisture. 



4. The effects of age. 



5. Bilaterality. 



6. Antero-posterior symmetry. 



1. The "Break" from the ground Color, or prevalent 

 Color, compared with the Positions at which Hair is re- 

 tained IN nearless hairless Animals. — When an animal of 

 a single color changes (even in a slight degree) the uniformity of 

 the tint, the new color will appear in an order definite enough 

 for the variety, species, and sometimes for the family to which 

 the animal belongs. A black, gray or chestnut colored dog when 

 thus changing almost invariably has a white spot appear at one of 

 the following localities : The tip of the tail,'^ the breast, the dorsal 

 surfaces of the feet, and the tips of the ears. I have observed these 

 changes in the New Foundland dog, the greyhound, the Irish setter 

 and the collie. In the sunbear ( Ursus malayanus) the prevailing 

 black is relieved by a crescentic whitish-yellow spot on the breast. 

 Sarcojjhilus when varying from its prevalent color exhibits a spot of 

 white in the same region. Horses having white feet and a white

^ According to Gervais the first white appears at the tip of the tail. G. T. 

 Rope (Zoologist, 1881, 353) states that where only a very minute portion of white 

 occurs, it is most likely to be found on the chest.

Star on the breast while the remainder of the bodies are dark are 

 objects of common observation. It cannot be an accidental circum- 

 stance that animals that are nearly hairless retain sparse clumps in 

 the same localities. Rhinoceros lasiotis is hairless except at the tip 

 of the tail, the dorsal surfaces of the feet and the tips of the ears. 

 Rhinoceros indicus shows the same peculiarities to a less marked 

 extent. In Elephas the tip of tail is similarly furnished. In the 

 ]\Iexican variety of the so-called hairless dog the same regions named 

 in Rhinoceros are alone hairy. In another variety the breast is 

 furnished with an abundant growth of hair. Men, who are more 

 than usually hairy, yet who do not belong to the group of universal 

 hypertrichosis, possess hair on the pectoral region, and are apt to 

 have a sparse growth of hair at the upper margin of the auricle and 

 a similar but separate line of hair along the posterior border, as well 

 as a patch on the loin or near the coccyx in the median line of the 

 trunk. 



It may be said that the regions named tend to behave difierently 

 from the prevailing disposition in hair-nutrition. In breaking from 

 a uniform color these regions present a contrasted color, and the 

 same regions tend to retain hair which elsewhere for the most part 

 is lost. 



But it must be acknowledged that in animals which are for the 

 most part hairless, clumps are seen which do not belong to the above 

 category. These are discussed under other heads. See hair at junc- 

 tion of limbs to trunk, (p. 94) hairs on dorsal line (p. 89) hair at nerve 

 ends. (p. 98) 



2. Bkindles. — In some animals the break from the prevalent 

 color assumes another disposition of a Avidely spread character. I 

 allude to the plan by which the entire pelt is covered by alternations 

 of black with brown or chestnut : these embrace the "brindles." The 

 wolf ( Canis lupus) is often a brindle. Many varieties of dogs e. g. 

 some of the mastiffs and bull dogs are brindles. It is often seen in 

 the female of the domestic cat. The prevalent color remaining black 

 the break is seen in dogs to take place to "tan" and to be localized 

 to the feet to the supra-orbital hair clumps and to the hairy wart on 

 the side of the face. The prevalent color being white, black spots 

 are apt to have "tan" margins as is well seen in the fox terrier. 



3. The regions in which Color-Marks are found reg- 

 ularly DISPOSED. — I will now treat of the manner in which the 

 color of a hue which is contrasted to the prevalent color is apt to 

 occur alone: definite lines or resrions of the bodv.

The Dorsal line of the Trunk. The line of the dorsal spines of the 

 Yertebral cokimn (including the head as far as the parietal foramina/) 

 is one of the most instructive of these. The black line in the ass 

 and the horse has especially received the attention of Darwin. 

 Prof. Jno. R3'der^ detected a dorsal arrangement of hairs in an 

 ■embryo of the domesticated cat. It retains the same color in many 

 carnivores. In the domestic cat two pairs of ])lack stripes are often 

 found on either side. In domesticated cattle these are supplanted by 

 a white line. In piebald rats the stripe is commouh' black. 



Lemur collaris,* has a prevalent squirrel gray color, while the head 

 is black and a Ijlack spot is seen at the root of the tail on the dorsal 

 surface. In Propithecus diadema,^ a conspicuous dorsal line is con- 

 tinuous with a black sacral region and tail. In Lemur varius^ the 

 same character of dorsal line is seen as in the foregoing animal but 

 is not so marked. In the parti-colored Lndris brevicaudatus' the 

 region of the back of the sacrum is distinguished from the rest of the 

 fur by being a uniform dull ochreous hue — a hue unlike that met 

 with in any other region of the body. In Propithecus verreauxi 

 coquerelii^ the dorsum near the lower part of the thorax is marked 

 by a dark spot, which is in contrast to the surrounding color. The 

 sacrum and loin are of a dirty gray color. In animals which ex- 

 hibit spots on the line which are in contrast to the prevalent color 

 the retained colors may ])e looked upon as persistencies which for 

 some reason have resisted the forces which have displaced the line 

 itself. Such a view is in harmony with Darwin's statement^ that 

 dappled and spotted animals were originally striped. One of the 

 numerous forms oi Lemur varius exhibits a white circle at the base 

 of the tail the prevalent color being light brown. This does not of 

 necessity correlate with the dark sacral spot. But distinctive kinds 

 of marking at the root of the tail in the dog are of the same signifi- 



1 These are persistent in the human cranium near the sagittal suture a short 

 distance in advance of the lamdoidal suture.

cance as the sacral spot. In Didelphys a dark pigment ring encircles 

 the base of the tail. In roan horses a white ring is occasionally 

 found which also encircles the base of the tail. 



In ThylaciHUs, Fells manul,^ Hyena striata, Myrmecobius, and in some- 

 of the viverrine genera, the line is interrupted and a number of sad- 

 dle marks are seen which are best marked posteriorly. In the dog- 

 when the black and tan colors are bred out, as in the English setter,, 

 the bull terrier and the fox terrier, the dorsal line is retained only at 

 the sacrum and at the root of the tail. It often forms an irregular 

 mark which may extend upon the flanks. In the " Chester reds,"" 

 a variety of hog bred in Eastern Pennsylvania, black is persist- 

 ently bred out, yet a small black spot is commonly found at the sac- 

 rum. In Phoca fasciata a broad white band crosses the trunk at the 

 sacral region. 



In Cercopithectis diana, the greater part of the dorsal region and 

 all the sacral region are of a red color which extends downward upon, 

 the outer surface of the flank. 



This disposition is seen in a number of the quadrumana. It ap- 

 pears to be repeated in many dogs (as already mentioned) in which 

 a flank mark is continuous with the sacral spot. The mark may be 

 homologous with the sacral saddle mark of Tliylacinus and Felis tif/ris* 



In a colony of piebald rats observed at the Zoological Garden, 

 Philadelphia, the sacral region was black while the prevalent hue 

 was white. 



I will now attempt to explain the persistence of color marks at the 

 region of the sacrum and the root of the tail, though the varieties of 

 the colors themselves are not at present susceptible of demonstration. 



In the range of human observation, L. Tait' records the frequent 

 possesssion — nearly 45 per cent — of a pit, or " sacral dimple," over 

 the sacral region in women. 



A. Ecker^ describes the frequent appearance of pits or depressions 

 in the region of the coccyx, in the foetus and in new-born infants. 

 The spot is associated Avith various pilose conditions. IMax Bartels* 

 describes a tail-like formation in man from the lower part of the 

 same region. Virchow' finds the pilose spots co-ordinated Avith

occasional deformity of the sacral spinal processes and he ar- 

 rives at the conclusion that the sacral pilosity is often connected with 

 attempts at formation of spina bifida. Both Tait and Ecker con- 

 nect the presence of the sacral depression with the formation of an 

 exserted tail. I make the suggestion that the retention of white,'black, 

 tan or lemon colored patches at the sacral and lumbar region is an 

 evidence in tailed quadrupeds of the great activity of nutritive pro- 

 cesses between the superficies and deep-seated parts. It is but a 

 ^tep further, and a legitimate step I think, to connect the sacral pig- 

 ment patches with the subject of sacral tumors which has been so ably 

 elucidated by R. Middeldorpf.' This writer traces the congenital 

 sacral tumors to retention-cysts of the neuro-enteric canal of the em- 

 bryo, as defined by Kowalensky. The canal is the same as the post- 

 anal gut of Balfour. It has been identified in Ascidians, Aviphioxus, 

 and in plagiostome and teleostean fishes. Should the retention of 

 the pigment patch at the superficies of the region where such pro- 

 found changes are seen to occur be proved to be associated with 

 minor degrees of interference at the same region, it follows that in 

 the individuals thus marked, minor changes in the sacral elements, 

 and possibly in the condition of the lumbar swelling of the spinal 

 cord, might be sought for. 



The Back of the Neck. — The region of the back of the neck inclu- 

 ding the withers is well known to be often furnished with a mane of 

 long or short hair. It is of interest to note that in a case of trichosis 

 circtmiscripta recorded by VirchoAV^ a distinct pilose growth lay over 

 the region of the third and fourth cervical vertebrse. 



As already remarked p. 88 the breast may be hairy in an animal 

 which in other respects is nearly naked. It remains to mention the 

 gnu in which form a pendant growth of hair from the same region 

 is found associated with an animal having short hair — and a long 

 tail furnished with a terminal Ijrush. 



The dorsi-facial Line. — The region of the head as far as that of 

 the parietal foraminal belongs to the trunk while that in front is 

 distinctive. A white median stripe is commonly found in the region 

 last named in parti-colored dogs. In some varieties a spot of the 

 prevalent color lies directly at the beginning of the trunkal region 

 near the occiput which interrupts the dorsal white line, in the rare 

 instances of its backward prolongation or may be enclosed by it. 

 Mephitis may exhibit a white spot on the dorsum of the face especially

92 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



in the young. Horses commonly show a white mark, the "star," 

 in the middle of the forehead between the eyes. In Cercopitheeus a 

 median white spot is often seen on the dorsum of the nose. 



The Ventre and Limbs. — The hair of the under part of the trunk 

 is in all animals less thick than that of the upper and is apt to be of 

 a lighter shade of color. The color of the ventre is continuous with 

 the inner sides of the limbs, and with the throat where it is apt to 

 pass in Quadrumaua to the crown. The account of the color-marks 

 of the limbs cannot be disassociated from that of the trunk. Thfe 

 hair of the outer surfaces of the limbs extends to the sides and dor- 

 sum of the trunk and neck, while the inner surfaces extend to the 

 ventre. " Stockings," by which term is meant patches of white color 

 which pass entirely round the manus or pes above the palm or sole, 

 are exceptions to the rule. 



The feet of an animal are liable to be of the same color and this 

 color to be black or a break from this color to a contrasted one (see 

 p. 88). In the horse this is notably the case — a bay horse has 

 black feet or exhibits a break from the black color to white. Both 

 fore and hind feet of the Thibetan hear, Ailuropus melanoleiicus, are 

 black, the rest of the animal being white, with faint shades of brown. 

 The fore foot in mammals is apt to a greater degree than is the case 

 with the hind foot to retain the same color for the arm and the re- 

 gion of the scapula. This is remarkably well seen in Ailuropiis, in 

 which form the entire fore limb including the shoulder is black, 

 while the hind limb and region of pelvis (excepting the foot) is white. 

 The region of the scapula in many animals is distinctively patterned 

 as is seen in the tiger (Felis tigris) and the leopard (Felis pardus). 

 In the dog the prevalent color of the neck and the trunk is rarely 

 continuous over the region of the scapula, which is usually of the 

 contrasted color. The spots on the side of the trunk in white dogs 

 appear to be arrested by the region of the scapula. A post-scapular 

 spot of an opposed color is commonly seen in dogs. 



P. Michelson' describes cases of trichosis circumscripta in which 

 clumps were found above and below the region of the scapula but 

 not upon it. I have often found similar clumps in hirsute men. In 

 the horse and its allies the stripes when sparsely distributed are con- 

 fined to the region of the scapula or lie in front of it. The region 

 of the scapula is apt to be white in Pecora. The region of the 

 shoulder, i. e. the region of the humero-scajiular joint, is separately

1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 93 



marked in a nunil)er of diverse forms. In many bats a tuft of white 

 color distinguishes this region. In the llama, camel and bison 

 shaggy tufts of hair adorn it. Cynocephahts hamadnjas exhibits on 

 both shoulders conspicuous growths of hair which extend back- 

 ward. In a specimen of Cohibus guerzci} the shoulder was found 

 furnished with an epaulet of long white hair. In other examples of 

 this species the epaulet extends backwards. B. Ornstein- describes 

 an instance of trichosis ch'cumscripta, in an adult man in which a 

 clump of hair was found on both shoulders. 



In Quadrumana the colors of the limbs are apt to be differently dis- 

 posed from the arrangement in quadrupeds. In Lemur catta the 

 colors are much like those in lower animals and in all varieties white 

 stockings may be seen in the fore arm and leg. The inside of the 

 limb is apt to be of a lighter color than the outer. 



With this qualification I think I may say that the outer surface 

 and anterior surface of the thigh to a point answering to the prox- 

 imal third or fourth of the tibia is differently colored in Quadrumana 

 from the leg and the foot. This is noticeable in Indris hrevicaxida- 

 tus^ and Propithecus verreauxi-coqiiereli.* 



The manus is commonly black in Quadrumana. In Indris hrev- 

 icaudahiii^ the outer side of the arm is black, while the entire fore- 

 arm is white. 



In the figures of Avidebert*' the separate color marks of the limbs 

 often correspond to the regions of manus, fore-arm, arm, pes, leg 

 and thigh especially for the outer surfaces. From the well known 

 artistic abilities of Audebert these figures may be accepted as au- 

 thoritative.' 



The ulnar Border of the Foreleg. — The ulnar border of the fore- 

 leg often displays hypernutritive characters. The disposition is not 

 confined to the mammalia. In this class the growth is most likely 

 a survival of the natatorial form of foot and is at best an adaptative

7 C. F. Maynard (Quarterly Journ. Boston Zool. Soc, 1883, II, IS) states that 

 in the variety of liear ( Ursus Americanus) met with in Florida "brownish lines" are 

 seen "starting from the point of each shoulder and extending down the legs on the 

 inside." This disposition is certainly e.xceptional. 




94 PEOCEEDIXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



effort to extend a fold of skin from tlie sides of the limb. A skin- 

 fold is demonstratable in Menopoma (where it is supplied by a 

 branch of a nerve) as well as in Eviys and its allies. It is the be- 

 ginning of the hair-covered membrane in the flying squirrel {Sciur- 

 opterus) and in Belideus; it is enormously displayed in the bat. 



The long fringe on the ulnar Ijorder of the fore-arm in the setter 

 doo- may be named as an example of its occurrence in a terrestrial 

 mammal. 



The fold corresponding to it is not so evident in the hind leg — 

 where it would naturally be sought for on the inner border. The 

 line of feathers seen in some varieties of the pigeon and of the domes- 

 tic fowl on the outer border of the leg may be associated with a 

 similar proclivity to that above named. 



In a case of tvichosis circumscri])ta recorded by B. Ornstein^ in an 

 adult male a growth of haii-s was found on the ulnar border of the 

 fore-arm of both sides. 



In some species of Quadrumana the hair of the arm and the fore- 

 arm inclines toward the elbow. Wallace' and Darwin^ describe this 

 arrangement in connection with the use made of it by the animal in 

 shedding the water falling up(.n the flexed limb. That the hair in 

 Hylohates agilis should be directed toward the wrist is evidently an 

 aberrant arrangement if we are to follow the distribution of the 

 lanugo as outlined by Eschricht and Voigt. 



A marked instance of growth of the hair from ulnar border of the 

 fore-arm and the corresponding border of the arm is met with iu 

 Propitheeus verreauxii-coquerelli} A long brilliant fringe of orange 

 and white colors equals in width the arm at its greatest diameter. 



The Axilla and Pudenda. — The presence of hair in the axilla and 

 pudenda in man is not without interest in connection with the pilose 

 regions of the newly born infant. It will be noticed that both Esch- 

 richt and Yoigt separated the pudenda and the entire perineum from 

 the rest of the body. 



In Lemur var'mf the prevalent color being a light brown the per- 

 ineum is black. The axilla is often of the same color as the inside 

 of the entire fore-leg in Indris brevicaudatus.^

It would appear that retention of hair at both junction of the fore 

 and hind leg with the body is in someway connected with se- 

 cretion and with retention of heat at these localities. (See p. 94.) 

 The l^lack stripe which is well defined in many examples of Lemur ' 

 varius may extend as far as the patella or a little distal of that bone. 

 •In the case of the child exhibiting circumscribed trichosis reported 

 by H. Ranke^ a large pilose patch occurred at the front ol the pa- 

 tella and the upper part of the leg to its distal side. Two small 

 patches were found in line with the front of the thigh. 



The position of the pilose marks above mentioned can l)e consist- 

 ■ently placed in the same category as the thigh marks in the lemurs. 



The Collar. — The region of the head is distinguished in some of 

 the more specialized mammals by a transverse band extending from 

 the vertex down over or near the auricle (commonly in front of this 

 appendage) and is variously dispersed on the neck. It is an inter- 

 esting region since it affords some of the most striking superficial 

 color-marks of the Quadrumana and is the probable precursor of the 

 hair of the crown of the head and of the beard in man. 



In the figures of Eschricht's and Voigt's papers on the lanugo al- 

 ready quoted, the outlines of the region of the color are clearly deter- 

 mined. 



In many species of Quadrumana the region of the vertex of the head 

 to near the occiput, the auricle, the region below the auricle and the 

 throat and submaxillary regions are white. This disposition is con- 

 spicuous in Hylobates lar.'^ In Colohus guereza, the prevalent color 

 "being black, a white color is disposed as above and extends down 

 the neck to the clavicle. In Colohus vellerosus the collar is white 

 and includes the gular region. In Cercojnthecus diana, the white 

 collar is interrupted by black at the side ; the chin is furnished with 

 a white goatee. The prevalent color is a squirrel gray. In Cebus 

 hypoleucus the collar is continuous down the neck and is continuous 

 with the white scapular region and with the outside of the arm to a 

 little below the elbow. The prevalent color is black. 



In Lemur varius^ the ears, retromaxillary region and the neck 

 uniting the head lines, are white. In Lemur albifrons* a white band 

 -extends from the white crown over the head and thence to the 

 neck.

96 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888, 



In Lemur catta^ the prevalent color being squirrel gray, the white 

 color between the eyes unites with the color round the eyes and 

 thence passes to the front of the neck. In another individual of the 

 ■same species (Xo. 268) the crown remains black, while the i-est of 

 the collar is white. In Phoca fasciata a white band encircles the 

 head and neck at the region of the auricle. 



It will be seen from these examples that the color of the vertex 

 which may be defined as the crown of the head, excepting the mar- 

 gin near the occiput, is often white ; that this color tends to pass 

 down over the region of the ear to the neck, where it may unite 

 Avith the white of the ventre and embrace more or less of the arm. 

 With the exception of Phoca fasciata I have not met with this color 

 mark outside of the Quadrumana. "Within the group last named 

 the band appears to be homologous with the hair of the crown and 

 the whiskers of the human subject. In the Saki the color is black 

 in this region and inclines forward to the submandibular growth 

 or the beard proper. 



The abruptness of termination of the white patch on the crown as 

 it approaches the occiput, appears to relate to the limitation of 

 baldness of the human subject, and explains the common retention 

 of hair at the line of the occiput. The occiput is under the control 

 of the causes which maintain the body color as distinct from that of 

 the "rest of the head. 



The Regions of the Special Senses — In addition to the dorsi-f\icial 

 stripe in the carnivores and the "collar," the mammalian head dis- 

 plays a very noteworthy feature in the retention of a contrasting- 

 color to the prevalent one of the body, about the nostrils, the eye- 

 lids and the auricles. Such a style of coloration is typically rep- 

 resented in Ailuropus melanoleucus, in which form the body color is 

 a dull white. According to Darwin^ the Himalayan rabbit at birth is 

 white, but in the course of a few months it gradually assumes dai'k 

 eyes, nose, feet and tail. The circumpalpebral black is found in many 

 animals when the ear is imperfectly pigmented, as in Didelphys and 

 Solenodon. In Nycticehus javanicus the circle is brown. In Xycti- 

 pithecus and Loris the two circumpalpebral circles unite in a median 

 dorsal line. In iVo^'wa the circle is white. In Cercopithecus aethiops,. 

 G. collaris and C. fuliginosus the eye-lids are white. In many dogs- 

 which are otherwise black or black and tan — a conspicuous black

patch purroiinds one eye and includes one or botli ears. Such are fox 

 terriers, bull terriers and bull dogs. The two patches of circumpal- 

 pebral black may interrupt the dorsi-facial white stripe as is seen 

 occasionally in the beagle. 



Both the eyelids and the auricle may be included in the same patch 

 of black as is seen in many dogs especially in pointers. The same 

 is noticed in the Japanese dog. This disposition leads the observer 

 to note that the same black patch may extend still farther backward 

 and be found on the sides of the body. A typical example of such 

 an arrangement is seen in Myrmecopliaga jiibata. In Myrmecohiun 

 the circle extends backward in a stripe. I have seen a similar stripe 

 in the Scotch collie. In Procyon the patch is for the most part in- 

 fra-orbital and extends backward to include the ear. In one of the 

 many varieties of Mephitis the ear and auricle are included in a 

 line of black, while the rest of the head is furnished with white lon- 

 gitudinal stripes ; more commonly, however, the entire head is Itlack 

 except a jugal stripe which is white aud extends down on the sides 

 of the trunk but inclining toward the dorsum as in Myrmecopliaga. 

 AYhen the auricle is black the tip may be furnished with a pencil of 

 white hairs which suggest the reversion to the plan of coloration de- 

 scribed on page 88. 



The region of the nostrils or the muzzle is pigmented black in 

 most mammals an exception being found in the Quadrumana as in 

 Semnopiihecus nasalis. 



It is interesting to find that in the bull terrier the black may dis- 

 appear in whole or in part from the muzzle. 



The special organs containing as they do black pigment often ap- 

 pear to determine retention points of the same color at the periphery. 



The breaks in the circumpalpebral color determine the disappear- 

 ance of the color from the region in hairless animals excepting the 

 broAV where it is apparently caused by the presence at that point of 

 the circumorbital wart. The eyebrow in man is in reality a stripe 

 which tends to pass backward in obedience to the tendency of the 

 stripe in animals generally. 



But the direction taken by the eyebrow is not a guide to all the 

 transitions in the form of the black about the eyes. A vertical 

 black stripe extends from the eye to the mouth in the cheetah (Cyn- 

 cehirus jnhatus). The same patch includes the lip in some New 

 Foundland and pointer dogs. 




^8 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



The auricle and the hair growing from it need not be entirely- 

 black. The margin only is black in the hoary bat {Atalapha cinerea) 

 and in Didelphys. The hair upon the auricle may be entirely white 

 instead of black as in the North American badger ( Taxidea amer- 

 icana). The base of the auricle may be alone covered with black 

 liair as in the fox-terrier, or with tan as in the beagle. 



The auricular black in the dog may include the skin of the side 

 of the head for a variable distance and may cross the vertex and be 

 in common with the corresponding patch of the opposite side. This 

 arrangement interrupts the dorsi-facial Avhite stripe. The appear- 

 ance of black, tan or white spots on the vertex surrounded l)y patches 

 of a contrasted color form "points" of breeding in some of the var- 

 ieties of the dog.' 



May it not be expected that a connection can be traced between 

 the region of the obeleon and the pineal eye ? Embryology teaches 

 that the presence of various color marks of the skin appear before 

 many of the more important deeper organs, and that the species 

 to which an embryo belongs can be determined before the genus. 

 The occasional reappearance in the dog of a patch of pigment at 

 the spot at which an organ of special sense appeared in a remote 

 ancestor, but which has no functional expression in the living de- 

 scendant, is in harmony with many of the conclusions drawn from the 

 data presented in this paper. 



• The Sides of the Body. — In Pecora the sides of the alidomen and 

 chest are variously stripped and spotted when the body elsewhere, 

 is differently marked. The young of the boar (Sus scrofa) is striped 

 on the body. Lateral stripes are also seen in Coelogenys, and 

 in Tamias and Spermophilus. Many varieties of domestic cattle 

 show white spots extending up from the sides of the body from the 

 ventre to variable distances. 



Is it likely that the dorsal marks of the horse and carnivores, 

 and the saddle marks of Thrjalcinus, extending as they do downward 

 are opposed in Pecora '^ by the disposition of ventral marks which 

 extend upward ? 



Nerve-Endings. — The Avhite stripes on the face in many South 

 American bats, in Lop)hiomys, in Taxidea, and in some varieties of 

 Mephitis, appear to be distinct from the simple contrast of color of 



1 In a recent exhibition of dogs in Philadelphia the vertex spot of the contrasted 

 color was seen in the pointer, the Irish setter and the beagle each twice, in the 

 spaniel and fox terrier each once.

the l)lack of the special organ above mentioned. In the tiger's marks, 

 as seen on the muzzle, they are undoubtedly correlated to the distribu- 

 tion of the infra-orbital nerves. It is probable that similar patches 

 of color, either black or white, are related to similar causes. Among 

 them may be mentioned the black oral angle in Felis onca, the white 

 lips of Tapir pinchaque, and the black lower lip in some varieties 

 of the bull terrier and the fox terrier. In the ground hackie 

 {Tamias striata) I have demonstrated that the main longitudinal 

 body stripe atiswer to the terminal filaments of the intercostal nerves 

 and to those nerves which are in serial homology with them.^ I have 

 found the spots on the fawn of the Virginian deer ( Cariacus virginia- 

 nus) answer to the ])laces at which the cutaneous nerves pierce the 

 fascia. 



The papilla on the flexor aspect of the fore-arm which is seen in 

 the domestic cat, the sciurmorph and myomorph rodents, and in 

 some of the lemurs, is furnished with bristle-like hairs with the ex- 

 ception of the last named animals. It is supplied by a separate 

 nerve in the domestic cat. The length of the hairs correlate with 

 the length of the vibrissse of the labial set, and are used (as I have 

 observed in the common mouse) for cleansing the face and especially 

 in combing the labial bristles. J. Bland Sutton ■' found a small 

 bristle-bearing wart on the flexor surface of the the fore-arm in 

 Lemur catta, Chirogaleus coquerli and Hapalemur griseus. No special 

 pigment patches or hair clumps have been found associated Avith 

 this papilla. 



The so called "chestnut" of the fore-leg of the horse is probably 

 homologous with this growth. Owing to the changes in the limb 

 coincident with the reduction of the toes the growth assumes a more 

 posterior position. 



All warts and skin caruncles are best developed on the naked 

 spaces at or near the margins of hairy surfaces. They are well seen 

 on the margins of the regions of the whisker and the moustache in 

 the human subject. They are found about the mandibles in the 

 moose (Alces canadensis) and the hog. The same positions are 

 seen occupied by warts in the bat where the face is sparsely haired. 

 P. Michelson' found warts on the margins of the pilose patches in 

 trichosis circumscripta.

100 PROCEEBIXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



Animals which are uniformly furred carry occasional warts on 

 the fi^ce — one of these is always supra-orbital and another is on the 

 cheek, and forms in the dog the so-called '' kiss mark." It is often 

 separately mai-ked by tan in the black and tan terrier, when it con- 

 stitutes a "point" for the breeders of this animal. 



Virchow^ expresses the opinion that retention of lanugo upon the 

 face may be confined to the distribution of the fifth pair of cranial 

 nerves. 



Muscle-Regions. — The stripes and spots on the limbs and the dap- 

 ple-marks on the trunk, as well as some of the broader sheets of color, 

 appear to be related to the intervals between muscle-masses or to 

 the extent of skin-surfaces which corresponds to muscles. 



The depression between the radial and digital extensors in the 

 Felidae is often marked by a black stripe. Felis chaus of India ac- 

 cording to Sir W. Elliot" exhibits a brown bar on the inside of the 

 arm. This writer assumes that the mark is distinctive of the East 

 Indian species. I have seen a black mark in the same locality, in 

 many examples of the varieties of the domestic cat in or near 

 Philadelphia. 



The black mark on the front of the thigh in lemurs (see p. 93) is 

 limited distally to the region of the tibia at which the gracilis, semi- 

 tendinosus and sartorius muscles are inserted. The region of the 

 back which answers to the lower trapezius sheet is abruptly outlined 

 in pure black, in contrast to the white color of the loin and of the 

 lower distal region, in Indris hrevicaudahis? H. Ranke* reports a case 

 of trichosis circumscripta, in which a patch was found in front of and 

 below the right knee and a second over the front of the left knee. 

 These marks may be held to be homologous with the distal ends of 

 the black femoral stripe in Indris brevicaudatus as already stated 

 above. 



Regions which are rich in Seba and Moisture. — Eschricht^ called 

 attention to the fact of the early appearance of the sebaceous glands 

 in connection with the development and distribution of the hair. 

 While the presence of seba is found associated with hair-growth 

 the fact that some clumps of hair are found in regions which 

 are especially rich in the secretions poured from the skin, form a

separate group of the localities which show special disposition to re- 

 tain abundance of hair. Such regions are illustrated by the hairy 

 warts about gular pouches, by the hair of the axilla, of the pudenda 

 and of the perineum. 



The hair of the perineum is commonly distinctly colored in the 

 dog and in some of the lemurs. The highly colored and' vascular 

 surfeces of the region of the perineum in the Cynopithecoids are 

 probably created by the same cause. 



The hair of the external auditory canal is associated with cerum- 

 inous glands. The coarse hair at the base of the nipple nuxy be 

 included in the same category. 



I have found the wrinkles of the skin of the head of the wart-hog 

 (Phacochoerus aethyopicus) correspond to the black stripes seen in 

 the zebra (Eqiius zebra). I have no proof, however, that this mark- 

 ing is caused by influence of seba or of moisture. 



The roof of the mouth being black in many mammals induces the 

 observer of pigment patches to include this region under the head- 

 ing of the distribution of color marks on the general integument. 

 It is interesting to note that the efibrts of breeders to run out the 

 black from the integument will often result in the loss of pigment 

 from the roof the mouth. That the oral surface is capable of 

 yielding special outgrowths which are comparable to those of the 

 skin is shown in Balaena and many rodents. 



4. Effects of Age. — That the color marks of young animals 

 frequently difter from the adult forms is a matter of common obser- 

 vation. The relations existing between the young of one species and 

 the adult form of others .have been often observed but need further 

 elucidation. The white collar at the base of the neck in some dogs 

 is seen in the young form only of the bear. The change in the 

 Himalayan rabbit from white, to white with dark markings has 

 been already noted. 



The corresponding changes which take place in the animal in old 

 age has received much less attention than it deserves. The few ob- 

 servations I have made confirm the statements made elsewhere 

 respecting the orientation of pigment patches. Horses often 

 become gray in the circumpali^ebral regions before they change 

 elsewhere. An Italian gray-hound, which I have observed for a 

 number of years, displays as it advances in senility a dorsal white 

 stripe, a white star on the breast, a circumpalpebral gray patch and 




102 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



white feet. In a word the fawn gray of adult life turns to white in 

 the same regions (with the exception of the tip of the tail and the tip 

 of the ear) that an animal is apt to break from its prevalent color. 

 (See p. 88) 



The loss of hair from the crown in man is the loss of the dorsal 

 part of the "collar" of the Quadrumana as already mentioned on 

 p. 95. 



The growth of the hair from the tragus in man is more decided in 

 middle life than at an earlier period and turns gray at a later period 

 than the whisker. 



5. BiLATERALiTY. The study of color marks in connection 

 with the law of asymmetry yields many attractive results. Prof. 

 Wm. H. Brewer' found the white marks on the feet of horses more 

 developed on the left than the right side. In JS^ydipithecus I have 

 found the left supra-orbital region white, and a white spot detected 

 on the left cheek, while the remainder of the fiir was gray. H. 

 Ranke^ describes a case of trichosis circuviscripta in which a pilose 

 patch was seen on the left cheek in advance of the region of the 

 whisker but none corresponding to it on the right. The left arm, 

 according to R. Hilbert,^ may be alone pilose and a patch of icthyosis 

 be confined to the shoulder of the same side. Dr. Henry H. Donald- 

 son found as the result of many observations on the human subject 

 in the south of Germany, the wart on the nasio-labial groove 

 to be much more frequent on the left than the right side. He 

 found a similar disposition in numbers of engraved portraits of 

 distinguished men of all nationalities. I have frequently found the 

 black circumpalpebral patch in the fox-terrier and the bull-terrier 

 confined to the left side, or Avhen the patches are found on both sides 

 the left patch to be the larger. According to W. H. Flower* the 

 color-marks of Lycaon are remarkable for being different on the two 

 sides of the body. Prof. Brewer states^ that in man the beard com- 

 monly turns gray first on the left side. It cannot be a coincidence 

 that the left side in all the above instances shows the greatest disposi- 

 tion to variation. I have found a similar disposition to exist in the 

 antlers of the Virginian deer.

Naevus bearing abundant growths of hair has been found by J. 

 Nevins Hyde ^ confined to the left side of the body in the form of 

 three bands Avhich followed in the direction of the intercostal nerves; 

 a fourth band extended from the perineum to the scrotum and 

 penis. 



6. Antero-posterior Asymmetry. — The anterior half of the 

 body may be disposed with reference to the color marks and the 

 quantity or kind of hair, in a manner different from the posterior. 

 This disposition is strikingly seen in many specimens of the tapir,, 

 the anterior part (Avith the exception of the lips which are white), 

 being dark, while the posterior is white. In Hystrix the posterior 

 half of the body alone bears the quills. In Phascolardos the poster- 

 ior half of the body is white. In Hapale hlcolor a similar coloration 

 is seen. In Chrysochloris aurata the posterior half only of the body 

 justifies the name. 



Concluding Remarks. — In reviewing the subject of the distribution 

 of color marks in mammals it is evident that the causes of the ar- 

 rangements are various, and do not admit of easy solution. The 

 points which I have attempted to elucidate do not invalidate biolog- 

 ical principles already established, Avhile it must be acknowledged 

 that some of them do not remain explained by these principles alone. 

 That variations of deep lying structures will influence the periphery 

 which over-lie them is a well established law. Illustrations are seen 

 in the relations which exist between the true organs of generation 

 and the skin coverings over them. It is but another application of 

 the principle to find the sacral spot correlating to conditions of the 

 neuro-enteric canal, and yet another in the skin about the nostril, 

 the eye and the auricle remaining black because the true organs of 

 olfaction, vision and audition also contain black pigment. The 

 principle of antero-posterior symmetry — of bilateral symmetry and 

 asymmetry are also illustrated. 



The general contrasts of the color marks of the head as opposed 

 to those of the body, which are so common in parti-colored animals,, 

 may be explained by the enormous influence which the brain must 

 exert over the nutrition of the entire region. That nerve-endings 

 can influence the color of the integument near them is abundantly 

 proven. From the lateral line of teleostean fishes to the ground 

 hackie is a long series in which the influence of nerve endings on 

 the sides of the trunk can be associated with color marks. Sebaceous

secretion and sweat conjoined with elevation of temperature appear 

 to explain the retention of hair at the pudenda and axilla. Dr. Geo. 

 Dinuuick of Cambridge, ]Mass., has informed me that he has influ- 

 enced the arrangement of color marks on the elytra of Coceinella 

 by varying the temperature to Avhich the insects had been subjected. 

 According to H. Pryer^ "temperature has a great evolutionary value 

 in insects." 



That margins of nutritive regions aflbrd the conditions favorable 

 to the appearance of warts agrees with what is known in a osseous 

 system with respect to erostosis and a1)sorption. In a growing 

 cranial bone I have found its greatest thickness in the position of 

 its centre of ossific deposit; in the adult bone the thickness is great- 

 est at the margins. When sutures are well defined vascular activity 

 is most marked along their lines. In atroj^hy an area of deficiency 

 always occurs lying at a point somewhere between the centre of 

 ossification and the borders of the bone.'' 



It is probably in obedience* to the same law that in lialdness a 

 lock of hair commonly persists at the bregma and in the upper part 

 of the metopic line. AVith respect to skin folds it must be said that 

 the disposition is caused primarily by the position of the skeleton of 

 the limbs to that of the trunk, head and neck. In Rhinoceros and 

 Armadillo the folds answer pretty exactl}' to the divisions above 

 named. But the folds on the side of the trunk between the limbs in 

 Armadillo appear to be caused by muscular action if one can 

 accept the conclusions drawn from the appearances seen in the in- 

 stantaneous photographs of the hog as taken by Mr. Muybridge.' 



If motion can originate skin folds it can also determine coloi'- regions, 

 iind the category of the pigment patches in the intervals between 

 muscle-masses and the limitation of color-areas to muscle sheets be- 

 come practicable.* 



The history of each mammalian embryo must present many phases 

 of nutrition — especially of precocity and of retardation — which de- 

 termine individuality. In a litter of two xiy more individuals the 

 changes due to temperature, to motion, to rate of local blood inter-

4 It is a tempting subject for study to elucidate the viistribution of skin 

 diseases by the application of the same methods undertaken in this essay. 

 The margins of the areas of the lanugo, — the course of distribution of nerves or of 

 vessels, the influence of the bone lying in close juxtaposition to the skin, the 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 105 



change must cause variations in the rates of growth in accession or 

 repression of force which will call into activity one or more of the 

 proclivities above named. The extreme variety of this individual 

 experience doubtless explains the great difference seen in the ways 

 that animals are colored. 



The fact that coloration is limited, or that it is apt to be limited, 

 to the points of convergence of Eschricht and Voigt would appear 

 to be a tentative conclusion. The careful study of the peculiarities 

 of the animals which are born naked would jjrobably greatly 

 strengthen it. 



I will conclude by making the suggestion that the distribution of 

 color-marks along the directions already indicated is a larger phase 

 of the subject of evolution than is outlined by "mimeticism" and by 

 "natural selection." I assume that Ailuropiis does not, for the reason 

 that it cannot, change the black feet, the black auricle and the black 

 circum-ocular region for one in harmony with the ground color, not- 

 withstanding the disadvantage to which the contrast between the 

 black and white subjects him. I also assume that the breeders of the 

 dog cannot run out the black from the skin over the sacrum and 

 the root of the tail with the same ease he can determine many other 

 colors. According to natural selection and domestication the vari- 

 ous regions above named explain the frequent occurrence of colors 

 which are of great use to the individual but they often meet with 

 abrujDt limitation owing to the influence of deep-lying restraining 

 causes. 



occurrence of acne pustules or syphilitic papules in positions in which the marginal 

 warts occasionally appear, — the retention of the hair near the bregma and at the 

 occiput in instances of loss of hair other than from age, can be noted in studying 

 the distribution of eruptions upon the skin and of naevi as well as of color marks. 

 But the field of observation is difficult when the conditions are often so fleeting. 

 The impressions of a single observer are not sufficient to secure definite conclusions: 

 For information, including literature of this phase of the subject, the reader may 

 refer to the experimental researches of A. Irsai and V. Babesin ^ upon the influence 

 of the nervous system upon the pathological conditions of the skin, and to T. 

 S. Dowse on the nervous affections of the skin and its appendages. 2

KESEAECHES UPON THE GENERAL PHYSIOLOGY OF NERVE 

 AND MUSCLE. 



BY Dr. HENRY C. CHAPMAN AND Dr. ALBERT. P. BRUBAKER. 



No. 1. 



Electrical currents and Electro-motive force of Muscle and Nerve in 

 frog. AYhatever view may be entertained as to the nature of the 

 electrical currents present in injured muscle or nerve, whether the 

 same be regarded as pre-existing in the uninjured condition, or as 

 being developed through injury, there can be no difference of opinion 

 as to the fact that such currents exist, at least in the injured condi- 

 tion. In as much, however, as so far known to the authors of this 

 communication, all researches hitherto undertaken Avith the object 

 of demonstrating the presence of electrical currents in muscle and 

 nerve, and of more particularly determining the electro-motive force 

 of the same, have been made by Prof. Du Bois Reymond it does 

 not appear superfluous to bring before the attention of the Academy 

 the results of some recent investigations made by the authors in the 

 Laboratory of Jefferson Medical College upon large specimens of our 

 our common frog, Rana Catesbiana. That the presence of electri- 

 cal currents in nerve and muscle should have long escaped the notice 

 of physiologists was doubtless due, not only to the imperfect forms of 

 galvanometers formerly in use, but also to the fact of electrical cur- 

 rents being developed whenever two electrodes were placed in contact 

 with organic tissues. With the construction of delicate galvanom- 

 ters, like those of Wiedemann, and of non-polarizable electrodes, that 

 is of electrodes that will convey or divert an electrical current present 

 in a muscle or nerve to a galvanometer, without generating one, it 

 became possible to demonstrate without cavil that injured muscle and 

 nerve are seats of electro-motive force. The instruments made use of 

 in obtaining the results tabulated below, were of the convenient form 

 devised for this purpose In^ Prof Du Bois Reymond,^ to whom this 

 branch of science is so much indebted, and consisted of a Wiedemann 

 galvanometer with telescope and scale, a round compensator, mercurial 

 keys and whippe and non-polarizable diverting cylinders and divert- 

 ing vessels ^ the latter or non-polarizable electrodes being always

shunting off from the circuit of a standai'd element, a Daniell's cell 

 for example,whose electro-motive force is kno\vn=l'08Volt, an amount 

 of current sufficient to neutralize or compensate the current deflect- 

 ing the magnet, the latter due to the electro-motive force of the' 

 muscle or nerve and which is to be determined. Thus, for example, 

 let us suppose that the electrical current diverted by the non-polari- 

 zable cylinders or electrodes, Fig. 1 (E) from the nerve or muscle (M) 

 to the galvanometer (G) be sufficient to deflect the magnet to an 

 extent corresponding to 267 divisions of the scale. If now the 

 compensator be moved so that the wheel III be opposite (n) 

 for example, part of the current from the Daniell element will return 

 through IVII F whence it came and part through III P" to the 

 muscle (M) and, being in the reverse direction to that of the cuiTcnt 

 from and due to the muscle, the magnet will be slowly brought back 

 from the the 267th division of the scale to zero, the wheel III then 

 standing at (n), or the 820th division of the wire of the compensa- 

 tor, the latter (N) being divided into 1000 parts. Such being the 

 case it is evident that the electro-motive force of the nuiscle or X is to 

 that compensating it, or to (1), (the amount of the compensating 

 force depending upon the resistance offered by the fractional por- 

 tion of the wire L) as the electro-motive force of the Daniell element 

 or (E) is to the whole resistance or W+L, or more briefly :^- 

 X : 1 : : E : W+L

Finally it will be observed that the graduating of the compensa-

diately after compensating or before, since— -^i^^- from (3) =T7jaa7) 



of the Daniell, that is each division of the wire of the compensator 

 at that moment switches off the Ttfffouth of a Daniell and as it required 

 820 such to compensate, lUU =tV was the fractional portion of the 

 Daniell element needed. It need hardly be added that in determin- 

 ing the electro-motive force of a nerve, we proceed in exactly 

 the same way except that we make use of the diverting vessels as 

 electrodes instead of diverting cylinders. 



It may be mentioned incidentally that in all of the experiments 

 performed in the above manner the telescope and scale were 

 placed at a distance of 2'5, met (8 feet) from the galvanometer, the 

 coils lay close up to the magnet, that the temperature of the lab- 

 oratory was about 70°F. (38'9 C) the season January and February, 

 the time of day noon. The following table gives the results synop- 

 tically arranged of 25 experiments performed upon the gastrocnemius 

 of the frog and of 25 experiments upon the sciatic nerve of the same 

 animal. Resuming, it will be observed that the average deflection 

 of the magnet due to the electrical current of the muscle corresponded 

 to 217 divisions of the scale, the electro-motive force causing the same 

 the xVth of a Daniell or 0"0696 D. a greater electro-motive force 

 than that yet obtained, the same amounting according to Du Bois 

 Eeymond ' to 0-035— 0*075 D. the mean of which is 0-055D. It may 

 be also mentioned incidentallv in this connection that the electro-

motive force of the semi-membranous muscle was found in several 

 instances to amount to as much as the x^th of a Daniell or 0"1 D. 

 The deflection of the magnet due to the electrical current of the 

 sciatic nerve corresponded on an average to 21 divisions of the scale, 

 the electro-motive force giving rise to it to the 55th of a Daniell or 

 0'0237 D. a result agreeing closely with that of Du Bois Reymond^ 

 viz : — 0*022 D. In conclusion it is worthy of observation that the 

 electro-motive of the muscle is more than three times as great as that 



of the nerve.

DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW SPECIES OF TJNIONES FROM FLORIDA. 

 BY BEPvLIN IIAKT WRIGHT, PENX YAX, N. Y. 



Tlnio Fryanus. Plate II, fig. 1. 



Shell elliptical, very smooth, ver}^ inequilateral, substance of the 

 shell thin, inflated in the umbonial region, beaks projecting very 

 slightly beyond the hinge line, ligament short, thin and light brown. 

 Epidermis yellowish red and covered with bright green rays which 

 are so thickly set upon the upper portion of the shell as to give that 

 part, a bright green color: the young are of a bright shining green 

 over the entire surface, the green being interrupted by heavy lines 

 of growth of a light red color. Ligamental margin sub-angular 

 before and .slightly arched, posterior margin disposed to be slightly 

 bi-angular and quite uniformly rounded above, anterior margin 

 abruptly rounded ; basal margin uniformly rounded ; cardinal and 

 lateral teeth doul)le in the left and single in the right valves, the 

 cardinal teeth short, oblique stout and crenulate, lateral teeth slightly 

 and uniformly curved , dorsal cicatrices deep and slightly posterior 

 to the cavity of the beak, anterior cicatrices slightly impressed and 

 distinct. Nacre quite uniformly purplish. 

 Diameter .60. Length 1.00. Breadth, 1.75 inches. 



Habitat Lake Ashby, Volusia County, Florida. 



Mus. Acad. Nat. Sciences. Phila. Newcomb Coll., Cornell Univ. 

 National Museum. 



Remarks. This species is highly polished, and the young are 

 rich in lustrous rays. The strongest affinity is with U. spams Lea. 

 It approaches U. fuscatus Lea, but is thicker through the umbonial 

 elevation, and the umbos are farther forward, and its valves thicker, 

 heavier, and not so flat. The dorsal view shows it is enlarged anteriorly, 

 while that of fuscatus is not so. It can not be mistaken for U. per- 

 lucens or U. micans Lea. Abundant on the muddy bottom of the 

 outlet of Lake Ashby, Volusia Co. Fla. 



Named for Mr. T. Mar.shall Fry, of Syracuse, N. Y. who is an 

 enthusiastic collector and student of the Unionidse. 

 Unio Websterii Plate II, fig. 2. 



Shell oblong, inequilateral, considerably inflated, rounded at the 

 sides, surface roughened by numerous obtuse irregular lines of 

 growth, substance of the shell thin, ligamental margin moderately 

 arcuate and rather short, posterior margin slightly biangular, liga-

mental area narrow, umbonial slope subangular, anterior margin 

 projecting and uniformly rounded, basal margin slightly and uni- 

 formly curved. Epidermis reddish, interrupted by coarse, distant 

 radiating lines of a blackish color. Greatest length near the 

 middle of the shell, beaks eroded and ornamented Avith three to 

 five radiating elevations. Umbos broad and rounded: nacre delicate 

 flesh color to pink, usually clear, rarely mottled with waxy spots; 

 cardinal teeth disposed to be double in both valves, slender, ob- 

 lique, long and delicately crenulate, lateral teeth long and heavy, 

 curved; cavity of the beak deep and rounded, cavity of the shell 

 deep, and occasionally the surface is interrupted with undulating 

 ridges near the anterior portion of the cavity; dorsal cicatrices 

 forming a continuous line extending from the base of the posterior 

 cardinal tooth backward for one half inch and directly under 

 the edge of the roof to the beak cavity; anterior cicatrices small, 

 the superior one undermining the anterior portion of the cardinal 

 tooth, posterior cicatrices confluent. 

 Diameter Ih Length 2.50. Breadth 44 inches. 



Habitat. Lake Woodruff*, Volusia Co. Florida. 



Mus. Acad. Nat. Sciences. Newcomb Coll., Cornell Univ. Na- 

 tional Museum. 



Remarks. This is the largest Unio yet found in Florida waters. 

 Its place is between JJ. Savannahensis Lea and U. Mechlenhurgensis 

 Lea. It is more inflated than the former, thinner, has more promi- 

 nent and narrower beaks, higher and more rounded umbos, deeper 

 and smaller anterior cicatrices and the teeth are lighter. 



We ai-e pleased to name this species after our botanical friend 

 Mr. Buchard AVebster of Lake Helen, Florida, who, with his father, 

 often made our collecting trips more pleasant. 

 TTnio Waltoni. Plate II. fig. .3. 



Shell compressed on the posterior slope, transversely elongated, 

 very inequilateral; valves rather thin, beaks not prominent and 

 eroded ; epidermis brownish black, apparently rayless, valves ante- 

 riorly rounded and oblique upward and shai'ply angled above, obtusely 

 rounded behind; cardinal teeth nodulous, small, complex and serra- 

 ted; lateral teeth lamellar and slightly curved upwards; nacre purple. 

 Basal margin very much excurvated. 



Diameter 1.00. Length 1.50. Breadth 4 inches.

Remarks. This species has the general form of U. Emmonsii Lea, 

 and is more in affinity with that species, than with U. Shepherdiamis 

 Lea. The former is a mucli heavier species, and with coarse heavy 

 teeth. U. Shepherdianus Lea, is deeply emarginate on its basal 

 margin, and the sides of its valves are very much constricted ob- 

 liquely from its projecting umbos down, while U. Walto7ii, is very co»z- 

 vex in its basal margin and its umbos not projecting, and its anterioi" 

 end veiy obliquely rounded, instead of evenly rounded, and a thin 

 shell. It can not be confounded with U. perlatm, Lea, though the 

 obliquity of the anterior end is much alike in both. It^is with much 

 pleasure that we name this curious species, after iSIr. John Walton, 

 a zealous and Avorking conchologist, and artist of Rochester N. Y. 



TJnio Dorei. Plate III, fig. 1, 



Shell ovate, heavy; polished, rayless; epidermis reddish, with 

 brownish colored elevations or growth-ridges; beaks blunt and mas- 

 sive, dorsal margin very broad, short and slightly ai'ched; posterior 

 margin quite straight; Umbonial angle sharp and supplemented by 

 two parallel elevations which are more or less broken by undulations; 

 basal margin slightly rounded, anterior margin truncate and angu- 

 lated above; cardinal teeth with a tendency to being double in both 

 valves, very massive, smoothish; lateral teeth very long, heavy and 

 uniformly curved ; nacre a rich salmon color ; cavity of the beaks 

 almost wanting: of the shell considerable. Named for Mr. H. E. 

 Dore, and enthusiastic collector of mollusca of Portland Oregon. 



Diameter 1.25. Length 1.6. Breadth 2.60 inches. 



Habitat. Lake Monroe, Florida. 



Mus. Acad. Sciences ; Coll. B. H. Wright. 



Remarks. The affinity of this species is with TJ. Conasangaensis 

 Lea, but the teeth differ, the umbos of the latter are not so broad 

 and blunt, and are farther from the anterior end, and has a u'hite 

 nacre. There is much disparity between it and U. Backltji Lea. 



Unio Averellii. Plate III, fig. ?>. 



Shell obovate, thin, fragile, slightly inflated, inequilateral, smooth^ 

 polished, interrupted by numerous green capillary rays arranged in 

 fascicles wdiich are narrowest at the a nterior end of the shell, and broad- 

 en gradually until near the umbonial angle where they merge together, 

 giving the posterior portion of the shell a dark green color; epider- 

 mis yellowish; beaks flattened, rather blunt, slightly and coarsely 

 undulated; dorsal margin nearly straight; ligament short, horn 

 colored, thin; anterior margin short and gracefully rounded; posterior

t 



margin bluntly rounded, basal margin with a tendency to emargina- ^ 



tion in old females; quite uniformly curved in males; greatest 

 diameter near the middle of the ligament, greatest length at posteri- 

 or end of dorsal line; cardinal teeth double in both valves, compress- 

 ed, very oblique, crenulate, the anterior tooth in the right valve is 

 much the smaller, as is the posterior one of the left valve; lateral 

 .teeth single in the right and double in the left valve, curved and 

 slender; nacre light purple and spoted with a few dark-waxy spots; 

 dorsal cicatrices two to four and in a diagonal row from the base of 

 the anterior cardinal tooth across the centre of the cavity of the 

 beak, anterior cicatrices distinct and well impressed. 



Diameter .8. Length 1.2, Breadth 2 J inches.

Eemarks. This delicate species, is possibly related to U. papyra- 

 cetis Gould. But Dr. Gould in his description of that species, says 

 that "it resembles Anodonta Couperiana Lea, in shape, delicacy and 

 even color." 



But there is nothing in C7. Averellii to remind one of An. Couperi- 

 ana Lea. It has the outline of U. occiiltus Lea, but its affinity is 

 with U. rutilans Lea, but differs in being very thin, almost paper- 

 like, less blunt at each end, and without a depressed area at the 

 anterior ligament. Named for Mr. "Wm. D. Averell publisher of 

 the Conchologist's Exchange, of Philadelphia, Pa. 

 Unio Nolani. Plate IV, fig. 1. 



Shell wide, smooth, rather thick, beautifully polished throughout, 

 .and entirely covered with heavy greenish rays; ejiidermis yelloAvish 

 and often olivaceous ; dorsal margin arcuate, anterior margin grace- 

 fully and perfectly rounded, basal margin subemarginate, posterior 

 margin uniformly rounded from the end of the ligament to the base 

 with no tendency to biangulation; umbonial angle flatly rounded; 

 umlionial slope flattened, depressed in the middle; beaks small, 

 pointed, undulated, and rather jirominent; cavity of the shell small ; 

 cardinal teeth heavy, erect, grooved, double in the left and single in 

 the right valve ; lateral teeth curved, heavy and much roughened ; 

 nacre beautiful pink and iridescent. 

 Diameter .9 Length 1.5. Breadth 3 inches.

Habitat: A creek flowing into St. John's River, near Palatka, Fla. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 117 



Remarks. This beautiful shell was found by Mr. J. B. Upson- 

 several years ago. Its affinity is with L^. corneas Lea, and witli TJ. 

 PosteUii Lea. From the latter it differs in not haying a striated and 

 scaly epidermis, and in not having thick, but compressed cardinal 

 teeth. The former has much heavier teeth, the groove of the lateral 

 teeth being shorter and much farther from the cardinal teeth, and 

 the beaks farther from the anterior end, and the post-ligamental area 

 much more conspicuous. It can not be taken for TJ. phuiilateris- 

 Con. which has a stramiueus epidermis. 



We name this peculiar species for Dr. Edw. J. Xolan, Librarian 

 to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. 

 Unio Hinkleyi. Plate lY, fig. 2. 



Shell oblong, trapezoidal, attenuated and pointed behind, smooth, 

 slightly inflated, and often flatish ; rather thin, polished above. 

 Epidermis black, thickly covered Avith brown, indistinct fine rays, 

 visible with transmitted light. Posterior margin subemarginate, 

 raised into a compressed wing. Anterior margin rounded and slightly 

 oblique. Dorsal margin a slightly arched curve. Basal margin 

 slightly convex. Umbonial slope raised and obtusely rounded. 

 Cai'diual teeth compressed, thin, very oblique and grooved, double 

 in both valves. Lateral teeth very long, slender and undulating, 

 nearly straight. Dorsal cicatrices four or more in one or two 

 rows. Nacre pinkish, and iridescent. Umbonial region broad and 

 blunt, very slightly j^rojecting, but often deep. 

 Diameter 1.00. Length 1.50. Breadth 3.00. 



Habitat. Lake Monroe, Florida. 



Mus. Acad. Nat. Sciences. National Museum. 



Remarks. In outline this species is similar to that of U. decUvis 

 Say, but its black epidermis, its pinkish or purplish nacre, readily' 

 distinguishes it from that species. 



It is dedicated to Mr. A. A. Hinkley, of Dubois Illinois, an ac- 

 tive collector of Unionidie. 

 Unio Simpsoni. Plate V, fig. 1. 



Shell oblong-ovate, pointed behind, and often very slightly unci- 

 nate below the point, inequilateral, remarkably smooth and polished. 

 Valves thin, slightly inflated, and rarely with a few coarse, perpen- 

 dicular, impressed grooves near the centre. Sometimes the valves 

 are very flat. Ligamental margin higher behind, and straight 

 or slightly arched. Posterior slope biangular below, straight or 




118 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



sliglitly emarginate, and raised into a distinct and angled carina, 

 which is thin and compressed. Ligamental area often with several 

 small plicae. The posterior end is generally sharply compressed 

 above and below, giving it a lance-shaped and ancipital appeai-ance. 

 TJmbonial ridge depressed, narrow, and rounded. Anterior margin 

 rounded and slightly oblique, basal margin convex. Epidermis 

 vellowish-brown or olive colored, or even bright green, with slender 

 green rays in uneven fascicles, or rayless and reddish-brown all over. 

 Umbos very much flattened, and beaks very small and pointed, hav- 

 ing a few concentric folds. Cavity of the beaks nearly obsolete. 

 Dorsal cicatrices small and deep. Cardinal teeth oblique and very 

 small. Lateral teeth long, thin, undulated and nearly straight. 

 Nacre salmon or purple, or both mixed. Shell darker behind and 

 ^t the base. 

 Diameter .75. Length 1.12. Breadth 2.30 inches. 



Habitat. Lake Woodruff, Volusia Co., Florida. 



JNIus. Acad. Nat. Sciences. Cornell University. National ]Mus. 



Remarks. The left beak is often shorter than the other. Its affin- 

 ity is with U. viridicatus Lea, which has much larger cavities under 

 the beaks, the lateral teeth coarser and not undulating and the an- 

 terior end not obliquely rounded, and is not rayed. It cannot be 

 mistaken for U. Jayamis Lea. We have great pleasure in dedica- 

 ting this species to Mr. Charles T. Simpson of Ogallala, Nebraska, 

 who has done very much in studying the mollusca of Florida. 



¥nio Marshii. Plate V, fig. 2. 



Shell somewhat narrow-elliptical, transverse, ventricose and very 

 inequilateral, smooth, incremental lines close and slightly raised. 

 Substance of the shell rather thin, and of very uniform thickness; 

 swollen in the umbonial region ; umbonial slope rounded ; posterior 

 slope compressed and rounded ; dorsal margin nearly straiglit ; an- 

 terior margin abruptly rounded ; basal margin much excurvate and 

 slightly constricted near the posterior extremity ; posterior margin 

 bluntly rounded and emarginate above ; turned up, raised into a 

 very small, depressed, and thin carina. Beaks blunt, broad, with- 

 out concentric undulations but possessing three or four raised, radiat- 

 ing lines; epidermis remarkably thin, reddish brown below and green- 

 ish above, indistinctly and closely rayed over the anterior portion, and 

 very dark or black on the posterior slope; nacre, a beautiful salmon 

 varying to purple ; cardinal teeth compressed, erect, striate, very 

 oblique and disposed to be double in both valves ; lateral teeth long,

solid and curved ; dorsal cicatrices four, well impressed and situated 

 under the base of the anterior end of the lateral teeth which continue 

 almost to the cardinal teeth. 

 Diameter 1.3. Length 2.00. Breadth 3 1 inches. 



Habitat. Lake Woodruff, Volusia Co., Florida. 



Mus. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila. Coll. of Berlin H. Wright and 

 Mr. W. A. Marsh, Aledo, Illinois. 



Remarks. This species, though belonging to the Buckleyi group, 

 has specific characters distinguishing it from U. Buckleyi Lea ; the 

 adult is very excurvate on the basal margin, has a very smooth and 

 polished epidermis, filled with obscure rays, the anterior end being 

 directed obliquely upwards, characters not pertaining to adult U. 

 Buckleyi. The symmetry of the dorsal and basal curves is peculiar, 

 being in this character like the same curves of U. symmetricus Lea. 

 Its affinity is Avith U. Buddianvs Lea, diflfering in the teeth and 

 other characters. Dedicated to Mr. Wm. A. Marsh, of Aledo Illinois, 

 an amateur of the Unionidae. 



"Unio Dallii. Plate VI, fig. 1. 



Shell ovate, pointed and flattened behind, the point being directed 

 downward, in an uncinate manner. Polished above, and lustreless 

 below, valves not thick, thicker before, epidermis black, rayless, 

 with numerous stride of scaly plicse below the umbonial region. Lig- 

 amental margin much arched, with an angle at each end. Posterior 

 margin usually slightly and evenly convex. Basal margin emar- 

 ginate near the posterior end, anterior margin nearly truncated, or 

 abruptly rounded. Umbonial slope very depressed, obtuse and 

 scarcely carinate, and the sides of the valves are decidedly flattened 

 just forward of the umbonial slope. Greatest diameter in the mid- 

 dle of the shell. Umbos broad and flattened, obtuse, projecting, 

 and very much eroded. Sides with numerous close coarse lines of 

 growth. Nacre salmon or pink, vai-ying to copper color, iridescent 

 and usually with wax-colored spots, which often are confluent and 

 cover the interior. Cavity of the shell, and of the beaks shallow. 

 Lateral teeth long, heavy and much curved. Cardinal teeth coai-se, 

 deep, divergent. Anterior cicatrices distinct, the larger are deep. 

 Posterior cicatrices confluent, well impressed. The type specimen 

 is about two-thirds the full size. 

 Diameter 1.00. Length 1|. Breadth 2- inches.

Remarhs. There i.s an affinity of this species with XJ. venitstus 

 Lea, but is more comjjressed behind and is larger. It has been 

 largely distributed as U. BucJcleyi, thus causing much confusion as 

 to what the latter really is. U. Buckleyi Lea, is more pointed be- 

 hind, not uncinate there nor emarginate on the basal margin. Its 

 umbos are farther forward and less elevated. Its greatest diameter 

 as well as gi-eatest length, is just behind the beaks, while in U. Dallii 

 the greatest length is through the summit of the umbos. 



It is named for Mr. W. H. Dall of the Smithsonian Institution. 

 TJnio Tryoni. Plate VI, fig. 2. 



Shell wide, narrow'-elliptical, compressed posteriorly, thin, polished 

 above. Umbos slightly elevated, the beaks being close to the ante- 

 rior end, and in the young undulated ; epidermis brownish or grayish 

 black, raised into numerous fine scaly strise, roughish, rayless, or with 

 some capillary obscure rays near the centre of the valves. Dorsal 

 margin straight, posterior margin bluntly rounded or truncate, and 

 triangular ; often subemarginatc above, basal margin slightly convex^ 

 anterior margin broadly rounded. Cardinal teeth of the left valve 

 are long, erect and widely separated to receive the single wide tooth 

 of the right valve. Tlie anterior tooth is shorter and less pointed 

 than the posterior one, and the latter is curved upward. Lateral 

 teeth very long, rather slender and nearly straight. Nacre livid or 

 light salmon colored and often with several dark-brown circular 

 spots. Cavity of the beaks very shallow. 

 Diameter 1.25. Length 1.75. Breadth 4 inches. 



Habitat. Lake Woodruff, Volusia Co., Florida, near De Leon 

 Springs. 



Mus. Acad. Nat. Sciences. Newcomb Collection, National Mus. 



Remarks. This species is much thinner and lighter than U. Oc- 

 mulgeensis Lea, with Avhich there is the affinity of outline. It is 

 much narrower than XJ. Buddianus Lea, and its cardinal teeth are 

 not oblique as in the latter. It is lighter, more rounded before and 

 more attenuated behind, and has a much shorter hinge line. Some 

 forms of it approach U. Jayanus Lea. 



It gives us much pleasure to dedicate this species to the late Mr. 

 George W. Tryon Jr., author of " Manual of Conchology" and other 

 concholo2rical works.

March 6. 

 Mr. Thomas Meehan, Vice-President, in the chair. 

 Twenty-nine persons present. 



Action of Hydrofluoric Acid on a Sphere of Quartz. — Dr. Otto 

 Meyer reported an experiment, which he had undertaken in con- 

 nection witii Mr. Sam'h L. Penfield. A sphere of quartz was sub- 

 jected to the action of hydrofluoric acid for more than two months. 

 Tlie acid dissolved the quartz, principally in the direction of the 

 main axis and thus flattened the sphere. In the direction of the 

 lateral axes the etching action proceeded with much less activity and 

 at three places on the periphery the acid had not eaten away any of 

 the material, but left the original surface of the sphere intact. These 

 three places were situated at one end of each of the lateral axes, the 

 result being a triangular disc. This experiment shows that a mineral 

 may be soluble in a liquid in certain directions and on certain planes 

 while at the same time insoluble in other directions and on other 

 planes. Dr. ]Meyer exhibited the result, the object resembling a 

 three cornered lens. — A more detailed account will be given else- 

 where. 



Remarls on the Phytogeny of the Lamellihranchiata. — Dr. Ben- 

 jamin Sharp brought forward some points regarding the classifica- 

 tion of the Lamellibranchiata, and stated tliat in considering this 

 gi'oup, a diversity of type was to be found that is equal to, if not 

 greater than that found in any class of the animal kingdom, with 

 the possible exception of the Hexipoda. 



In examining the different forms, he pointed out two well marked 

 extremes, Ostrea and AspergiUum. In the former as is well known, 

 the two large unequal shells entirely cover the body, and they are 

 closed by one large muscle, the adductor. The large and important 

 organ, so common in the Lamellibranchiata generally, the foot, is 

 entirely absent. The mantle edges are separated for nearly their 

 whole extent, and there is no indication whatever of the mantle 

 uniting to form a siphon. 



In AspergiUum, on the other hand, the two shells are so diminu- 

 tive, that they only cover an exceedingly small area of the animal's 

 body, the siphon is enormously developed, and it is protected by a 

 secretion of carbonate of lime, in which the shells are immovably 

 embedded ; the mantle is closed throughout its entire length, except 

 at the anterior end, where there is a minute opening, and at the 

 mouths of the two siphonal tubes. 



His object in making the communication was to prove that these 

 two very marked and different types of Lamellibranchiata arose 

 9 




122 PKOCEEDIXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



from a common or what might be called a central type, and that a 

 divergence from some cause set in, producing on one side the Ostrea^ 

 and on the other the Aspergillum. 



As regards the whole class, he said there is no doubt, in his mind 

 at least, that it is a degenerate one. ]\Iany anatomical and embryolog- 

 ical fticts, as well as their life habits, point to this, it being an acknow- 

 ledged fact that fixed or stationary animals are as a rule degenerate. 

 The loss of the head in all adult forms, the presence of eyes in the 

 head area of some free swimming embryos, and their later total dis- 

 appearence, are some facts that point unquestionably to the degenerate 

 condition of the whole group. 



As to the facts of geology pointing to this conclusion, he quoted 

 from Prof. Heilprin's work on the "Distribution of Animals," p. 2(J5. 

 "Almost everywhere, the Cephalophora, or head-bearing mollusks, 

 antedate by one full period the Acephala, or headless forms, which 

 indisputably represent a lower grade of oi'ganism." By considering 

 the group as degenerate, the conditions of the case are answered, for 

 the Lamellibranchiata certainly came off from the Gastropoda, after 

 the latter had become well established, as the anatomical and embry- 

 ological facts show, and the geological evidence would seem to 

 indicate this to be the case. 



Assuming then, that the Lamellibranchiata have come off from 

 the Gastropoda, Dr. Sharp then considered w^hat was the form of the 

 primitive type. It probably had a more or less developed foot, an 

 oi'gan that is present in all the Gastropoda, that it possessed gills on 

 each side of the foot, that the mantle edges were separate and that 

 two adductors were present of about equal size. This type has sur- 

 vived to the present day and, according to Lankaster (Art. Mollusca, 

 Brit. End. p. 685), is represented by forms like Nucula and Trigo- 

 nia. The former belongs to the family Arcidae {Claus) Avhich 

 is the oldest type that we know of, being found in the Silurian and 

 Devonian. The shells of this family are equal ; the adductor mus- 

 cles of the same size, the mantle free, not being closed to form 

 tubes like a si2:)hon, foot well developed. The fulcrum of the shell 

 is about equi-distant from the adductors. In following one branch 

 from this toward Ostrea, it is found that one muscle, the anterior, 

 gradually gets smaller, as is the case in Mytilis, and exceedingly 

 small in Pinna, imtil in Ostrea but one muscle is present. From 

 the fact that in this advance the animal becomes more and more 

 fixed first by a secretion of the foot, the byssus, then by the shell it- 

 self, the foot gradually is less and less used as an organ of locomo- 

 tion, until it entirely disappears in Ostrea. The retractor muscles of 

 the foot, now practically useless organs, are however, still present. 



The loss of one adductor muscle can probably be referred to me- 

 chanical causes. In studying the change of relation of the fulcrum 

 to the adductors, he found that as the fiilcrum moved forward (an- 

 teriorly) it increased the distance from the posterior, and lessened the 

 the distance fi'om the anterior muscle. As this took place, the muscle 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 123 



furthest from tlie fulcrum was always the larger, in fact it must of 

 necessity be so, as more power was needed at this point, while the 

 near one, from the fact that it does not require much power, dimin- 

 ishes in size. In Pinna, one muscle is very much, in fact four or 

 five times, larger than the other ; the smaller being close to the apex 

 of the shell, in other words, close to the fulcrum, 



As the fulcrum passes still farther forward, a point is soon reached 

 when both muscles come in line with the fulcrum, the larger one in 

 tliis case takes all the work from the smaller one, which from its now 

 useless position degenerates to disappearance. 



A proceedure from regular to irregular shell is to be seen in the 

 fresh water forms. XJnio, he held, is probably a fresh wnter 2Ii/ti lis ^ 

 which does not have any byssus present in the adult, but has one in 

 the embryo. A form that closely resembles the oyster can be trac- 

 ed through Aetheria to Miielleria, the so-called fresh-water oyster. 

 The later has both adductors in the embryo, but only one, like 

 Ostrea, in the adult. 



In passing now in the other direction, Dr. Sharp pointed out the 

 stages connecting the central type to the extreme in Aspergillum. 



In passing out from the central type, the Areas, the group known 

 as the Syphonata appear, where besides the large foot, it is found 

 that the aboral portion of the mantle has united at two or three 

 points, forming one or two tubes. In some forms of Lucina, by the 

 union of the mantle a single tube is formed, the so-called anal siphon,, 

 which corresponds to the superior one when two are present ; through, 

 this passes the water outwards, the inflowing water passing in through 

 the large space between the mantle edges, as in the asiphonated 

 forms. In this form of Lucina, specialization has only determined 

 the direction of the out-flowing current, which carries off" the deoxy- 

 genated water and the excreta. 



In Cardium the siphon is made up of two tubes; in other words, 

 the ingoing and outgoing currents are now determined. The edges 

 of the mantle commence to adhere, leaving room only for the pro- 

 trusion of the foot. In Venus the arrangement is practically the 

 same: — a Avell developed siphon, large wedge-like foot, which is a 

 locomotor organ, a shell entirely covering the animal when it is 

 closed and two well developed adductors, equal in size. The speciali- 

 zation in this line of development is in the direction of the siphon 

 and closure of the mantle. ATya Avould represent a form, leading to 

 Solen, here the siphon is large, the mantle more or less adherent, 

 but the foot has degenerated to a useless organ and the form of the 

 body still some what resembles Venus, the .shell, however, gaping at 

 the aboral or siphonal end. 



In Solen the edges of the shells cannot be brought together, or 

 they gape, as it is said. In this form the new type has become es- 

 tablished, and the animal resembles a cylinder ; the large siphon fills 

 up the aboral or gaping portion of the shell, Avhile the boring foot 

 fills up the oral pole of the shell, the mantle being nearly closed 

 between the foot and the siphonal openings. 




124 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



The shells of Madia are small for the body, and the siphons are 

 so large that they cannot in any Avay be drawn into the shell, a large 

 portion of the mantle also is without the limits of the shel], so that 

 the edges of the shell do not even touch in life. 



In Teredo, no hinge teeth are present, nor is even a ligament formed, 

 an organ that is present in all other Lamellibranchs, except the 

 members of this family and the next one to be considered ; besides 

 this a ncAV element is found, namely accessory shell pieces. The 

 enormously developed siphon, is four or five times the size of the 

 rest of Ihe body. The mantle edges are firmly united except at the 

 oral pole where the boring foot protrudes, and at the openings of 

 the siphon. The true shells as Avell as the accessory pieces are 

 movable, that is, not united with the calcareous secretion of the 

 mantle. 



In Gastrochaena. the shells are very small, but still movable, the 

 animal being enclosed in a calcareous shell, the secretion of the 

 siphon. In Clavagella, a similar form, one shell is welded to the 

 siphon shell, the right one only being free, and in the extreme form 

 o^ Aspergillum, both shells are immovably fixed in the shelly tube 

 that encloses the* animal. 



The fresh-water forms Cyclas, Cyprina etc., are probably related 

 to Cardium and have received their Jiew forms by moving into fresh 

 water. 



In summing up. Dr. Sharp showed two branches in the Lamelli- 

 branchiata, one going off" from a form related to Area the other 

 toward Ostrea, the fulcrum moving from a position between the two 

 equally large adductors, toward the oral pole of the body. This 

 brought the anterior adductor in a line with the fulcrum and poste- 

 rior adductor, where, being of no use, it disappeared. 



In the other direction, development is in the antero-posterior 

 direction, the shell, however, not taking part in the growth until a 

 form is reached Avhere the shell is exceedingly small and the animal 

 protected by a supplementary deposit of carbonate of lime.

Habit of Cirolana concharum. — Prof Leidy said that he yesterday 

 went to Atlantic City, in the expectation of finding interesting speci- 

 mens cast ashore in the recent storm ; but there proved to be nothing. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 12o 



He picked up a few recently dead Lady-crabs, Platyonichus ocellatus, 

 and found in them a number of the Cirolana concJiarum, feasting 

 upon the flesli and other parts, as he had previously noticed them 

 feeding on the edible crab. See page 80. From these observations 

 it would appear to be the usual habit of the Cirolana to prey on 

 dead crabs and probably other animals. 



Parasites of the Striped Bass. — Prof. Leidy exhibited numerous 

 specimens of a minute crustacean parasite from the gills of the Striped 

 Bass or Rock-fish, (Labrax lineatus), brought to our market. He 

 said it is a common parasite and he had been familiar with it since 

 1851. It was described by the Danish naturalist, Dr. Henrik 

 Kroyer, under the name ot Ergasilus labricis, obtained from the same 

 fish at Baltimore, (Danske Naturh. Tids. 1868-4, 303, Tab. xi, fig. 2). 

 Common as it seems to be ^Ir. R. Rathbun, in his published list of 

 the parasitic Copepoda from American waters, savs he had not ob- 

 served it, (Proc. U. S. :^at. :Mus. 1884, 483). The little crustacean 

 lives suspended on the outer surfaces of the gills, where it is conspic- 

 uous, from the white color of its thorax and egg-pouches on the red 

 color of the gills. The length of the parasite together with its egg- 

 pouches is 2-125 mm ; without the latter 1"25 mm. 



Prof. Leidy further exhibited portions of two intestines of the 

 same fish with numerous attached worms pertaining to Echinorhyn- 

 chis proteus, which infested many fishes, both of fresh and salt water, 

 of Europe. It is not only a frequent and abundant but a constant 

 parasite of our Striped Bass. It ranges from 5 lines to an inch in 

 length. The young ones are white; the older have the body yellow, 

 bright orange, or brownish orange, with a white neck and proboscis, 

 which togetber are one fourth the entire length. Diesing attributes 

 to the proboscis 8 to 10 rows of hooks, but Dujardiu gives double 

 the number, and this accords Avith the condition observed in our 

 specimens. The parasite lives in the large intestine with the pro- 

 boscis and neck together embedded in the wall and the body sus- 

 pended in the cavity. The proboscis and bulbous commencement 

 of the neck together jirotrude externally and form on the outside 

 of the intestine brown pyriform tumours, giving to the organ a 

 peculiar tubercular apjtearance. The worms exhibit the following 

 characters: Body widest at the conmiencement, where it is rounded 

 and slightly constricted from the rest, which tapers to the posterior 

 obtuse end. Proboscis cylindrical but expanded at the middle and 

 base. Neck very long, bulbous at the commencement becoming 

 narrow and cylindrical and a little dilated at the base; smootb 

 throughout. Length of a large one 24 mm ; proboscis and neck 6 

 mm ; proboscis 1*25 mm long, 6'175 thick, 0"25 at middle expansion ; 

 bulb of the neck 1 mm, narrow part below 0'375 thick, at base 0'5 

 thick. Body at commencement 2 mm thick, near posterior end 

 1 mm thick.

A paper entitled "Notes on the Myology of Ursus maritinius," 

 hy Edw. A. Kelly, was presented for publication. 



Trematodes of the Muskrat: — Prof Leidy' stated that in the collec- 

 tion of the Academy there is a vial labelled "worms from the duo- 

 denum of the Muskrat." There are 25 worms, and in their present 

 condition they are pale brown bordered by dark brown, and measure 

 from 12 to 18 mm long by 1 to 1"5 ram broad. If not identical, 

 they are closely allied to Distomum echinatum, which in the mature 

 state lives in ducks and other water birds and in the larval state 

 in fresh water snails. The ]Muskrat eats the latter so that it may 

 likewise become infested in the same manner as the ducks and this 

 ■would also seem to make it probable tliat the parasite is the same. 

 Dujardin, Wedl, and others describe D. echinatain as having the 

 fore-])art of the body echinate, which is not the case with the Distome 

 of the ^Muskrat, though in both the head is armed in the same 

 manner and with the same number of spines. Its characters are as 

 follow. 



Body long, flattened, band-like, with the neck tapering and the 

 tail obtusely rounded. Head reniform, with a coronet of strong- 

 straight spines, from 30 to 36. Ventral acetabulum much larger than 

 the head, situated at the base of the neck a short distance behind 

 the latter, spherical. Body of nearly uniform width. Oral aceta- 

 bulum small; pharynx oval; intestines simple and narrow. Genital 

 orifice immediately in advance of the ventral acetabulum; ciiTus 

 €xsert to one side, curved and smooth; testes situated almost mid- 

 way between the ventral acetabulum and tail; oviducts median be- 

 hind the ventral acetabulum; ova oval, yellow; vitelline glands large 

 and conspicuous, racemose, extending along the intestines from the 

 ventral acetabulum to the end of the tail. 



Head O'o to 0"6 broad ; spines about O'l long by 0*02 thick ; oral 

 acetabulum 0"25 ; pharynx 0'3 long, 0"225 wide; ventral acetabulum 

 0-875 to 1-25 mm. Ova 0-1 long by 0-072 broad. 



Since the above communication a collection of worms, from the 

 small intestine of a Muskrat, has been received. Eighteen of the 

 worms pertain to the supposed Distomum echinatum, and range from 

 18 to 25 mm long. In all, the fore part of the body to a short dis- 

 tance behind the ventral acetabulum is finely echinate, while the 

 rest is smooth. Two other worms appear to belong to Amphistomum 

 subtriquetrum, 12 and 15 mm long, a j^arasite previously observed 

 only in the Beaver of Eurojie. 




.1-888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 127 



Entozoa of the Terrapin. — Prof. Leidy stated that he had on one 

 ■occasion examined eight of our much esteemed food Terrapins, to 

 ascertain the character of their parasites. All were found to be in- 

 fested with an Echinorhynchus, living in the small intestine and 

 clinging by the thorny head to any part of the canal. The worms 

 ranged from six to sixteen lines in length and in numbers from five 

 to upwards of two hundred. The species is Echinorhynchus hamula- 

 tus originally described from several of our fresh water turtles. 

 (See these Proceedings 1856, 48.) 



In three of the Terrapins occurred a red thread worm, also living 

 in the small intestine and associated with the former, and like them 

 clinging, by their armed mouth, to the mucous membrane. The 

 species is the Guculamis microcejyhalus, the males up to nine lines, 

 the females from twelve to sixteen lines. In one Terrapin there 

 were eight, in a second over a hundred, and in the third upwards of 

 several hundred. They extended all along the intestine but were 

 most numerous at its upper part. The females are viviparous and 

 contained living young. 



In one Terrapin only, also in the intestine, there were two flukes, 

 the Amphistomwn grande, about half an inch long. 



In the bladder of another Terrapin there was a single PoJydomvm, 

 3'5 mm long, probably P. ohlongiim, first described by Prof. Wright, 

 of Toronto, from an individual obtained from the bladder of the 

 Musk Turtle, Aromoehelys odoratm. 



In another Terrapin he had found four Polystomes of which three 

 were in the throat and the other in the nose. These pertain to a 

 different species from the former and may prove to be the Polystomum 

 oceUatum, found in a similar position in the European Turtle, Emys 

 europaea. At the genital outlet of Polystomum situated ventrally 

 at the fore-part of the body, the cirrus is surrounded by a circle of 

 hooks. In P. integerrimum, the species best known, and found in 

 in Europe, living in the bladder of Frogs, the genital circle is com- 

 posed of eight hooks. Prof. Wright ascribes sixteen hooks to the 

 circle of P. oblongum, and this accords with the number in the 

 Polystomum fi-om the bladder of the Terrapin. In the other Poly- 

 stomes of the latter he found the circle to be composed of thirty-two 

 hooks. Siebold says there are forty hooks to the circle in P. oceUa- 

 tum. Dr. Zeller figures the latter, from a sketch of Siebold, in 

 Avhich the caudal disk is represenj;ed as having two large hooks and 

 eight small ones between the postei-ior pair of bothria. In the allied 

 Polystomes of the Terrapin the number and arrangement of the hooks 

 of the caudal disk is the same as represented in Prof. Wright's figure 

 of P. oblongum. If then we have a correct record of the facts, the 

 Polystome of the fiiuces of our terrapin may be regarded as another 

 species which may be distinguished as follows : — 



Polysto:mum coronatum. Body when elongated lanceolate. 

 Caudal disk wider than the body, cordiform, with three pairs of 

 bothria and with the body attached between the anterior two pairs ; 

 changeable in form to oblong, circular or quadrate ; with three pairs 




128 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



of minute hooks between the anterior pair of the botliria and with 

 a larger pair and two small paii's between the last pair of bothria. 

 Genital aperture with a circular or a transverse oval coronet of 

 thirtv-two hooks of equal length. Xo eyes visible. Length elonga- 

 ted from 4 to 6 mm. ; contracting to about half the length and 

 widening proportionately. 



Besides the foregoing there was found in the intestine of one of 

 the Terrapins a little Distome, of 3 mm. length, which though mature 

 he had not the leisure to examine. He also observed in the throat 

 of one a number of little anguillula-like worms which he likewise 

 did not examine. 



In all the Terrapins the flesh, liver, and other parts than those 

 above mentioned were entirely clear of parasites; therefore in pre- 

 paring these animals for food it is easy to free them from the latter 

 by rejecting the head, intestines and bladder ; or if it is thought de- 

 sirable to use the intestines they should be slit open and cleansed of 

 the contents. 



Prof. Leidy added that he had recently found in the collection of 

 the Academy, a bottle labelled " alimentary worms in terrapin." 

 These proved to be seven bot-larviie like those described and exhib- 

 ited at a former meeting. (See Proc. 1887, 393.)

NOTES ON AN AQUATIC INSECT, OR INSECT-LARVA, HAVING 

 JOINTED DORSAL APPENDAGES. 



BY A DELE M. FIELDE. 



I have found here (at Swatuw, China) in May and June, the tem- 

 perature of the air being about 80° F., in still pools of fresh, living 

 water, an insect or insect larva, having upon its back four longitu- 

 dinal rows of jointed appendages, of nearly the same length as the 

 body of the insect, and capable of being raised, lowered or bent, 

 either by the insect or by external pressure. During this year and 

 last year, I have found over a hundred specimens, varying from i 

 to I of an inch in length. Rotifera, Vorticella Vindi Oscillatoria with. 

 shreds of vegetable fibre, were attached upon and among the appen- 

 dages. The color varies with tlie habitat, from pale green to black. 

 As it slowly crawls upon water-plants, it resembles a minute porcu- 

 pine ; but it is discerned with difficulty, because of its similarity to 

 its vegetable environment. I have caught my specimens in only 

 one wa}^ — by taking from the pool, in which I hoped to find them, 

 a quantity of the water and algse, and keeping these in a basin till 

 the staleness drove the insects to the sides of the vessel, where they 

 escaped the sinking, decaying raft in which they had been concealed. 

 Several of the larger specimens found have been kept alive for more 

 than a month, in a soup plate in which the water was daily changed. 

 They appeared to feed on microscopic objects, probably the heliozoans, 

 rotifers and infusorians, which swarmed on the plate. They neither 

 grew nor moulted within the month, and finally died, oppressed and 

 perhaps suffocated by the diatoms that stood out like branches from 

 all their appendages, making them look like moss. That these 

 creatures moult in growing is proven by the exuvise of varying size, 

 found in the waters they naturally inhabit. 



The head is flat, with a pair of large eyes, made up of clusters of 

 six ocelli, projecting from the sides. The antennae are short, six 

 jointed, and just in front of the eyes. The biting mouth-parts are 

 strong and horny. The three thoracic segments bear three pairs of 

 six-jointed legs, ending in a long claw. All are used deftly in 

 clearing the back from parasites. The second pair is double the 

 length of the first pair, and the third pair a little longer than the 

 second. The abdomen has nine segments, with tlie prominent vent 

 on the ventral side of the posterior segments, which bears two sharp 




130 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



jointed styles, nearly as long as the body. The number of joints in 

 the anal styles vary from 7 in an individual I of an inch long to 11 

 in an individual ] of an inch long. The general shape of the body 

 is cylindrical, tapering posteriorly, with the ventral surface flattened. 

 All the segments, except the last, bear, on the dorsal half, four taper- 

 ing, jointed tubes, containing branches of the trachea. The number 

 of joints in each of these appendages vary from 12 to 17 in a speci- 

 men i of an inch in length. In a specimen I of an inch long there 

 were 7 joints in each dorsal appendage. The main tracheal trunks 

 run one on each side, between the proximal ends of the two rows of 

 appendages, through which they send long, straight branches.

SOME NEW SPECIES OF FOSSILS FROM THE NIAGARA SHALES 

 OF WESTERN NEW YORK. 



BY EUGENE N. S. EINGUEBERG M. D. 



In the following descriptions of seven new species from this vicin- 

 ity will be found representations from the three divisions of the 

 Niagara Shale including three genera which I believe to be new to 

 the Niagara of this State i. e. Mariacrinus, Hyolithes, and Plumuli- 

 tes. The specimens were all collected at Lock port and the types 

 are in my collection. 



Buthotrepis gregaria. (n. sp.) PI. VII, fig. 1. 



Plants small, gregarious, each separate plant growing in an irregu- 

 larily radiating manner from a central point, commencing in several 

 original trunks which rapidly branch out without any system or 

 observable regulai'ity, by bifurcations and lateral shoots. Diameter 

 of the I'adiating fronds as spread out, from two to three and at times 

 four c. m. It is however hard to get accurate measurement on 

 account of the habit of this fucoid of growing in little clumps con- 

 taining many individual plants, whose branches often interlace in 

 a confusing manner. Its growth in difterent directions is rather 

 irregular; sometimes one branch seems to out-grow all the rest, or 

 again two opposite will spread out till the plant is twice as wide in 

 one direction as in the other. The radiate arrangement, however, 

 seems to be quite constant. Thickness of the branches averages 

 about one millimeter. 



This curious little fucoid is readily recognized by its radiate gro^\i;h, 

 which together with the size of the branches seems to be quite in- 

 variable — and also by its habit of growing in little clumps, occasion- 

 ally specimens may be found which seem to grow upon the branches 

 of some of the stouter fucoids; such as Buthotrejns gracilis var. 

 crassa, Hall. 



Found in the harder shale bands from the middle third of the 

 shale at Lockport N. Y. 



Inocaulis anastomotica (n. sp.) PI. VII, fig. 2. 



Frond flabelliform or possibly circular or cyathiform in the per- 

 fect state. 



It is composed of large coarse branches, the principal ascending 

 ones of which are from two to three millimeters in width, with 

 smaller lateral branches and tips. Whole frond united by frequent 




132 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



anastomoses into an irregular network. The brandies seem to 

 anastomose as frequently by the growing towards each other of two 

 adjacent branches; these unite whenever they chance to meet into 

 a common branch, which grows upwards and bifurcates as before T 

 as by the more slender diagonal connecting filaments. 



By reason of this peculiar mode of growth no single branch can, 

 as a rule, be traced for any considerable distance as maintaining its 

 identity, for as it bifurcates each bifurcation is often met by that 

 from the adjoining two branches and they, by uniting, form a single 

 branch ; at the outer margin the branches taper down and terminate 

 in from two to more sharp points, or serrations. 



Surface of the branches marked by strong, irregular longitudinal 

 wrinkles, Avhich at times seem to assume a semi-scabrous character. 

 Margins of branches rarely present a slight serration or roughness; 

 and in places where portions of the black corneous branches have 

 scaled off the cast shows the obverse side to have the same character 

 as the other. 



The openings in the network are of various sizes and shapes but 

 mostly oval or fusiform, no two being alike. 



The type specimen presents about one third of the circumference 

 of a circle and measures nine c. m. from the niai'gin to as near the 

 center as is pi'eserved and which judging from the angle of radiation 

 of the branches could not be more than one c. m. further. 



There is some hesitancy in placing this species in this genus 1)6- 

 cause all the forms Avhich we are acquainted with are rather loosely 

 branching with few if any anastomoses or reticulations. Still the 

 character of the branches so closely resembles those belonging to 

 this genus that I am constrained to place it here. 



From the lower third of the shale at Lockport ranging as high 

 as the Homocrinus band. 



Only two fronds have been found in which the margin is preserved, 

 and both seem to represent portions of a quite regular circle. 

 Dendrocrinus oelsus (n. s. p.) PI. VII, fig. 3. 



Calyx elongate, cylindrical, slender, quite evenly tapering from 

 the insertion of the brachials to the base which is of the same size 

 as the last joint of the column. 



Height to top of first radials seven millimeters. Width of base 

 two millimeters. Width of top of calyx not quite six millimeters. 

 Arms branched, without pinnules. Under-basals much higher than 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 133 



wide, slightly arched transversely giving the base of the calyx a 

 moderately pentagonal form which is shared by a few of the upper 

 joints of the column. 



Basals long. 



First radials wide and short with a deep horse-shoe shaped articu- 

 lar facets in the center of the upper margin which arches strongly 

 outward to conform to this facet which is directed upward and out- 

 ward for the reception of the brachials. These are about eleven in 

 number before any bifurcation takes place. One ray is observed to 

 bifurcate twice above this point. Only the anterior sides is as yet 

 known. 



Column round, long, thick in its lower portion where it is quinque- 

 partite; it gradually tapers as it ascends till within a short distance 

 below the calyx where it is less than half of its original thickness, 

 and here its quinque-partite character disappears; and it continues 

 of the same thickness for some distance till within four millimeters 

 below the cup when it again commences to enlarge, finally becoming 

 sub-pentagonal just before reaching the calyx. Length of column 

 twenty centimeters — diameter near base about two and one half 

 millimeters; at a short distance below calyx about one millimeter. 



Radix tapering, inclined to one side and throwing off lateral root- 

 lets from the under half; it has been traced for about two centime- 

 ters but evidently was somewhat longer. 



This species is readily distinguished from D. longidactylus Hall, 

 w'hich is found in this grouj? by the elongated calyx with its much 

 higher basals and underbasals also by having about twice as many 

 brachials before the first bifurcation takes place, and by having a 

 sharper ridge in the first series; being there much like those above 

 the first bifurcation in the former. The peculiar character and 

 appearance of the brachials are almost sufficient to mark it as a 

 Dendroa'inus. 



The calyx was carefully scaled out of its matrix but unfortunately 

 the posterior side was found to be so crushed in as not to admit of 

 an accurate discription. 



Mariacrinus warreni (n. sp.) PI. VII, fig. 4. 



Calyx inverted penta-pyramidal, irregularily expanding from the 

 base to the second bifurcation of the radials, at which point it is, in 

 the type specimen, thirteen millimeters high; angles sharp with 

 strongly projecting, heavy, rounded carinae, the surface of which is 

 crossed by well defined, and generally transverse, rugae. 




134 PROCEEDIXGS OF THi: ACADEMY OF [1888. 



Surface of the radial plates transversed by coarse radiating ridges 

 of Avhich there are four or five on both sides of the central elevation 

 in each of the radials, surface between the ridges seems to be quite 

 smooth, although so much difficulty was experienced in removing 

 the adherent shale that this point could not be decided accurately. 

 The interradial and intei'-axillary plates have less prominent ridges 

 ornamenting their surface. 



Arms long, slender, of nearly equal diameter till near the tip, 

 where they are very gradually tapering to a quite acute termination; 

 surface smooth. Length about six centimeters, ])innules very deli- 

 cate from five to seven millimeters long at the lower portion ; rapidly 

 shortening at the tip of the arm. 



Column stout, as thick as the base of the calyx, at that pointy 

 fi'om which it evenly tapers as far as it is preserved, which is about 

 twelve centimeters, to one half its diameter at the calyx. Joints 

 with rounded central projections, Avhich are not quite so wide as the 

 joint is long. 



This species differs from M. carleyi, Hall, with which it agrees in 

 the' general size and contour of the calyx, principally in the surface 

 ornamentation ; it having a smoother surface and more numerous 

 radiating ridges on the radial plates, and they are also thicker than 

 in the former and the base is somewhat wider. 



This specimen is from the upper third of the shale, and is associa- 

 ted on the same slab with the Dendrocrinus just described, its column 

 lying across that of the former. This unique slab Avas found and 

 presented to the anthor by W. H. "Warren Esq. of Lockport, afler 

 whom the species is named. 

 Ortliis acutiloba (n. sp.) PI. VII, fig. 5. 



Shell bilobate, obversely cordate in outline, apex semi acute. Both 

 valves have a deep and sharp mesial depression^ thus forming an 

 acute notch in the anterior margin. Hinge line very short, termina- 

 ting in small sloping auricles which are scarcely noticeable when 

 the shell is viewed from the ventral side. 



A profile view shows the ventral side to be strongly convex Avith 

 the beak of that valve projecting far beyond the other and somewhat 

 outward, while the dorsal profile is sinuous, being slightly concave 

 immediately behind the umbo and convex anteriorly. Length and 

 breadth each five millimeters. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF rillLADELPHIA. 135' 



Dorsal valve with umbo but slightly projecting beyond the hinge 

 line, outer profile having an S like or line of beauty curve, "with the 

 concavity at the apical end and the convexity anteriorly; inner 

 or marginal profile regularly convex. Area small. Ventral valve 

 strongly convex in })rofile, inner profile concave ; area triangular, as 

 high as wide, with the foramen occupying one-half of its width. 

 Surface marked by strong radiating striatious which seem to increase 

 mostly by interstriation : they are from ten to twelve to fifteen in num- 

 ber on each lobe at the margin. These are crossed by lines of growth 

 which vary in distance from each other and increase in definition as 

 they approach the margin. 



This little shell belongs to the same group of orthidean forms as 

 Orthis hiloha Lin. PI. VII, fig. 6. and 0. varica Con., and when 

 first found w-as regarded as an example of the former, but upon com- 

 parison with some Wolcott, N. Y. specimens it was found to differ much 

 more from that and 0. varica than they do from each other. The 

 principal points of specific distinction are the more elongate outline 

 of the shell with longer and more pronounced lobes ; a deeper anterior 

 sinus, more acute rostrum and a greater disparity between the size 

 and curvature of the two valves ; and a hinge line which is compara-^ 

 tively only about one-half as long as that of the species under com- 

 2)arison. Only two })erfect specimens have been found, but occasion- 

 ally a single valve is seen imbedded in the shales of the middle and 

 lower thirds at Lockport. 



Not a single individual of 0. hiloha has fallen under my observa- 

 tion from this vicinity. 

 Hyolites subimbricatus, (n. :^p.) PI. VII, fig. ". 



Shell conical, sides regularly sloping from acute apex, aperture 

 about half as wide as height of shell. Surface marked by very faint 

 and closely arranged minute longitudinal stride, which are crossed 

 by irregular transverse strire placed at various distances apart, with 

 occasional stronger lines of growth which at times take on a slightly 

 imbricating character. 



On account of the partly flattened condition of the only example 

 thus far secured, the exact angle of divergence of the sides from each 

 other, and the outline of the aperture cannot be ascertained. 



This species bears some resemblance to H. columnaris of Barrande, 

 as figured by him, but the longitudinal strife are very much finer and 

 more closely arranged, so that they are hardly noticeable except 

 under a lens, and the shell is not so tapering.

Plumulites gracilissimus, (n. sp.) PI. VII, fig. 8. 



Plate exceedingly frail and delicate. Phylliform base broad, 

 evenly tapering to an acute apex, curved laterally, one margin 

 slightly concave or nearly straight, the other quite convex ; this lat- 

 ter side is considerably shorter than the other, thus giving an up- 

 ^vard slope to the base towards this side. Surface ornamented by a 

 median narrow ridge which follows the same general curve as the 

 plate and tapers to a point at the apex. On the longer half of the 

 plate, as divided by the median elevation, there is a secondary fili- 

 form ridge or striation subdividing that portion into two equal halves; 

 it extends from the base upwards towards the apical end, finally be- 

 coming lost before reaching it. 



These two longitudinal carinse are crossed by twelve or more 

 transverse lines which curve downwards in the centre from the two 

 sides towards, and having the same contour as, the margin of the 

 base ; they ai*e equi-distant and are placed about as far apart as the 

 width of the central elevation. Length six millimeters. 



This species approaches P. minimus Barr., in size, but is more elon- 

 gate like P. delieatus Barr., from which it differs in having a nar- 

 rower central elevation. Its fine lateral striation which again sub- 

 divides the longer lateral half is quite distinctive. 



From the lower third of the shale at Lockport only separate plates 

 have as yet been found.

A Orustacean Parasite of the Bed Snapper. — Prof Leidy remarked 

 that in the examination of the fish called the Red Snapper, Lutjanus 

 Blachfordi, brought to our market from Florida, he had observed a 

 curious crustacean parasite adhering to the throat about the pharyn- 

 geal bones. It appears to be an undescribed species of Anchor ella, 

 which, from its having a bundle consisting of half a dozen posterior 

 appendages, including a pair of large egg pouches, may be named 

 A. FAscicuLATA. The animal is milk white, though in the fresh con- 

 dition the egg pouches are slightly reddish, 

 and it is about half an inch long, including 

 the latter. The body is pyriform with its 

 long axis in the same line with the single 

 • suspensory arm, and with the head and neck 

 curved outward and a little downward to 

 one side. The head is bird-head-like in 

 shape, with beak directed upward and fur- 

 nished with two pairs of minute maxillipeds. 

 The suspensory arm, or brachium, about as 

 long as the head and neck together, is straight 

 and is surmounted by a button, which is ses- 

 sile and internally striated. At the base of 

 the brachium on each side there is a minute 

 papilla. The posterior appendages consist 

 'of two long cylindrical egg pouches and on 

 each side two much shorter sausage-like 

 pouches. The adjoining figure is an outline 

 of the parasite magnified six diameters. 

 Twenty-five were obtained from one fish. 

 Measurements of a specimen are as follow : 

 Length of body with brachium 2*5 mm ; 

 length of brachium 1-25 ; of head and neck 

 1-75 ; head 1' by 0-625 ; breadth of body 

 l'37o ; length of egg pouches 4", thickness 

 0'625 ; length of short pouches 1*625 and 

 1"25. Clinging to the head of one of the females of the Anchorella 

 was a minute male measuring 1*125 mm. in length. With the Ancho- 

 rellse was found a single specimen of Caligus which closely resembles

Note on Eleonorlte from Sevier Co., Arkansas. — Prof. George A. 

 Koenig submitted his identification of Eleonorite. This species oc- 

 curs in cavities of Dufrenite and likewise intimately interlaininated 

 with it. It is of deep blood red color and gives a yellowish streak. 

 The habitus is prismatic columnar, the prisms showing strong vit- 

 reous lustre and pleochroism — light yellow, in one direction, deep 

 red brown in a direction at right angles. On the very scant mate- 

 rial at the author's disposal, no planes are sufliciently developed to 

 allow of an identification of the crystallographic characters. The 

 specific gravity was found = 2'949. The crystals can be heated in 

 a mattras to red heat without decrepitation, without change of color, 

 lustre and shape, while yielding a strong condensation of water. 

 Reactions for iron and phosphoric acids. The mineral is slowly 

 dissolved in nitric acid, rapidly in hydrochloric acid. The iron is 

 entirely /em'c. The water is completely expelled at 250°C. Owing 

 to the scantiness of the material, the analysis was made with only 

 54 mg. of the mineral. 



This quantity yielded : water = 8 mg ; Mg^ P* O' = 26*3 mg.

hence the formula FeT*C + 8 WO. This is the formula estab- 

 lished by A. Streng (Zeitschr. f Kryst. and Miii. Vol. 7, p. 398). 

 Groth deduced from it the theoretical formula Fe^ (HO)^ (P0*)^ 

 2* H'O. (Tabell. Uebers. d. Mineral. Braunschweig 1882.) In 

 view of the fact that the whole of the water escapes at 250°C. with- 

 out change of color or structure, Groth's formula, assuming three 

 molecules of hydroxyl, can not well be sustained. The water must 

 be considered wholly as water of crystallization. 



Eleonorite has heretofore been known but from one locality, the 

 " Eleonore " iron mine near Giessen, in Germany. Some specimens 

 are in Mr. C. S. Bement's collection, with which the author compared 

 the mineral from this new locality. It was first announced by A. 

 Nies in 1880 (Ber. d. Oberhess. Ges. fuer Natur. u. Heilk. No.*19.) 

 and subsequently studied by A. Streng, who determined the sym- 

 metry as monosymmetric and established the formula given above.

NOTES ON THE MYOLOGY OF URSTIS MARITIMUS. 

 BY EDWIN A. KELLEY. 



The subject of these notes was a young female polar bear, probably 

 about three years old, which recently died at the Zoological Gardens 

 in Philadelphia, and Avas received at the University through the 

 courtesy of Mr. A. E. Brown, Superintendent of the gardens. The 

 animal measured about four and a-half feet from nose to root of tail ; 

 it had been rather roughly skinned and eviscerated, so that little 

 could be ascertained concerning the pannicidus, abdominal and peri- 

 neal muscles. My attention was given mainly to the limbs, and I 

 have here mentioned only such muscles as seemed to present note- 

 worthy characters. 



Neck. Splenius commences in fascia at the second dorsal ver- 

 tebra and its muscular area diverges from the middle line until at 

 the point of insertion, on the lambdoidal ridge, it is over two inches 

 distant from its fellow of the opposite side. 



Trachelo-mastoid rises from the fourth cervical to the first dorsal 

 vertebra, blends more or less with the splenius anteriorly and shows 

 a tendinous inscription opposite the axis. 



Complexus has a small separate slip from the fourth cervical, and 

 behind that rises in common with the trachelo-mastoid to the first 

 dorsal. 



Transversalis cervicis inserts as usual into the last five cervicals 

 and a complexus tert'ms runs from the second, third and fourth 

 cervicals to the transverse process of the atlas. 



Sterno-mastoid is a stout muscle which blends with its fellow for 

 about a third of the way up the neck ; at the level of the shoulder 

 it divides into two bellies, a postero-internal one which continues to 

 the mastoid process, and a more slender antero-external head which 

 runs forward and outward, crossing obliquely the cleido-mastoid, 

 and blends with the adjacent cephalo-humeral. 



Cleido-mastoid has its usual relations, rising in common with the 

 sterno-mastoid and diverging from it about the middle of the neck, 

 to insert into the deep face of the cephalo-humeral at the shoulder; it 

 is much more slender than the sterno-mastoid. 



Omo-hyoid is a well developed ribbon about three quarters of an 

 inch in width, which rises from the anterior border of the scapula, 

 some distance back from the coracoid process, and follows a gently 

 curved line to the basi-hyal bone. 




142 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888, 



Stylo-hyoid pursues its usual course transversely across the surface 

 of the digastric, to insert into fascia, just anterior to the basi-hyal 

 bone, being at that point over an inch in width. On the left side 

 there was inserted in common with it, a muscular slip about i in. 

 wide, which ran outward beneath the digastric and finally was seen 

 to rise in common with the latter ; this little band was not present 

 on the right side. 



Shoulder and Arm. Rhomhoideus major and r. capitis are 

 united for half way up the neck ; the former continues l)y fascia to 

 the region of the atlas. 



Cephalo- humeral as it proceeds towards the arm receives first the 

 slip from the sterno-mastoid and then the insertion of the cleido- 

 mastoid ; it shows at the latter point no tendinous intersection and 

 consequently the insertion of the muscle is the only indication of a 

 distinction between trapezia) and deltoid elements. Further down 

 it blends with the pectoral is and scapular deltoid, and inserts on 

 the lower half of the humerus, without showing any tendency to fuse 

 with the brachialis anticus. 



Acromio-trachelien, inserting on the metacroniion, rises not only 

 from the transverse process of the atlas, but also by a separate belly 

 I2 in. long from the rectus anticus major. 



Teres minor was stated by Professor Shepherd' to be indistin- 

 guishable from the infra-spinatus in his specimen of the American 

 black bear. In the present subject this muscle Avas quite distinct, 

 running more than half way back on the axillary border of the 

 scapula ; it inserted into the centre of the outer side of the great 

 tuberosity, while the infra-spinatus ran about an an inch further on. 

 I also found the muscle distinct in a young black bear, which I had 

 the opportunity of examining. 



The common tendon of teres major and latissimus dorsi shows very 

 clearly up to its insertion the distinction between the two elements 

 composing it. 



Pectoralis. At first sight the superficial aspect of the pectoral 

 seems to be formed by one unbroken muscular mass {pectoralis major) 

 which rises along the entire length of the sternum, a distance of 13 

 inches, and behind this for several inches on the abdomen, where its 

 inner border diverges somewhat from the middle line. From this 

 extensive origin, its fibres converge toward the middle of the hu-

 p. 108.

merus, and blending with the cephalo-humeral at a point 3? inches 

 from the head of the humerus, are inserted in common with the lat- 

 ter on the outer lip of the bicipital groove for a distance of 4 inches. 

 Beginning at a point 8 inches from the manubrium and 3 inches 

 from the middle line of the sternum, its posterior border begins to be 

 involuted, and this fold becoming deeper as it goes outward is finally- 

 inserted by an aponeurosis 2 inches wide, immediately beneath the 

 superficial layer. 



The posterior (" deep") division of the anterior thoracic nerve 

 fippearing at the anterior edge of this fold, runs backward over its 

 superficial aspect to the line of folding and then turns forward on 

 the deep surface of the main superficial mass, where it is finally lost. 

 Upon close inspection the posterior border of this mass is seen to 

 be split oflT as a separate band, which is several inches wide at its 

 •origin, comprising most of the part rising from the abdominal mus- 

 cles, but rapidly narrows as it passes outward until it is only about 

 I inch wide. This ventro-humeral slip is carried under with the 

 fold just mentioned, forming at first its anterior edge ; out toward 

 the insertion, however, the widening fold extends itself between the 

 ventro-humeral and the superficial pectoralis major, so that for a 

 space its edge coincides with that of the former, and finally, the ven- 

 tro-humeral, instead of forming the anterior border of the involution, 

 «omes to occupy the middle of its deep surface ; the two blend and 

 insert in common. The fold is thus seen to be complete without 

 the ventro-humeral slip, though the latter appears to be an intrinsic 

 part of it. The ventro-humeral and the main superficial mass (p. 

 major) are quite distinct down to their origins, but the line between 

 them is so obscure as to have escaped my notice at first. 



The concavity of the involution shows a disposition to split oflE a 

 number of narrow fasciculi. The outer edge of the posterior end of 

 the ventro-humeral approaches closely to the latissimus dorsi, but 

 there appears to be no connection between them. As, however, the 

 skinning had been rather deep behind the axilla, there might have 

 been connecting slips in that region which did not show in the spec- 

 imen. 



The distal end of the pectoralis minor (see below) lies immediately- 

 anterior to the involuted fold and in the same plane with it. The 

 muscle rises from the sternal ends of the costal cartilages, from the 

 second to the seventh inclusive, and pursuing an oblique course out- 

 ward and forward, inserts by a thin aponeurosis which partly at- 




144 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



taches to the outside of the great tuberosity and partly reaches the 

 surface of the supra-spinatus muscle and the coracoid process. It is 

 between this muscle and the involuted fold of the p. major that the 

 deep anterior thoracic nerve issues. 



Beneath the anterior portion of the pectoralis major and superficial 

 to the p. minor, lie two muscular ribbons. The more anterior (sterno- 

 scapularisf) rises for It inches on the manubrium and inserts, ante- 

 riorly by fascia and posteriorly by muscular fibres, into the great 

 tuberosity and bicipital ridge for a distance of 3 inches. It thus 

 increases in width outwards. The other baud lies immediately 

 posterior to this in the same plane, rising on the first three sternebr^e ; 

 anteriorly it is quite distinct from the p. major, but its posterior 

 border fuses more or less with the latter. Its anterior fibres have an 

 independent insertion on the bicipital ridge, while posteriorly it 

 inserts in common with the p. major and cephalo-humeral. 



The diverse ideas concerning the homologies of the pectoral ele- 

 ments, and the consequent confi,ision of nomenclature are well-known. 

 In the Carnivora, for instance, Cuvier^ denies the existence of a 

 pectoralis minor — though as remarked by Murie, the " Planches de 

 Myologie " of Cuvier and Laurillard repi'esent it as present ; this 

 opinion is supported by MeckeP and many recent investigators. 

 Others who admit the presence of the muscle differ considerably in 

 the element to Avhich they apply the name. Wilder^ believes the 

 superficial backwardly directed layers to be the pectoralis major, 

 and all of the deep forwardly directed bands, with apparently the 

 exception of the most posterior (" xiphi-humeral ") to be homologous 

 with the human pectoralis minor. Owen* seems to consider that in 

 the dog only the most anterior of these deep bands represents the 

 p. minor, while Shepherd^ applies the name to the muscle which has 

 here been described as sterno-scapular. 



The muscle which I have described as the pectoralis minor appeal's 

 to me to be such, not only in the bear, but throughout the Carniv- 

 ora, from its general position, from the usual continuation of its 

 fascial insertion to the coracoid process, and from its relations to

the two anterior thoracic nerves, which embrace and supply it much 

 as in the human subject. 



In most mammals there are behind the pectoralis minor, certain 

 other muscular elements — "pectoralis quartus" " xiphi-sterno-hu- 

 meral, " " ventro-humeral, " etc. — which have been the subject of 

 much discussion. Wilder, as mentioned above, considers most of 

 these as parts of the p. minor, but the most posterior slips he speaks 

 of ^ as probably " differentiated portions of the main pectoral mass. " 

 In the Carnivora, Macalister^ alludes to the "fourth pectoral or 

 brachio-lateral part of" the panniculus." As regards the Marsupialia,, 

 Cunningham^ remarks : " There is a diversity of opinion regarding 

 the character of the pectoralis quartus. Owen looks upon it as ' a 

 dismemberment of the pectoralis major.' Humphrey and Macalis- 

 ter believe that it is in an ' intermediate piece of the superficial ex- 

 ternal muscular sheet between the pectoralis major and latissimus 

 dorsi. ' Its close connection in many cases with the panniculus 

 carnosus would almost seem to indicate that it is merely a portion of 

 this muscle. In Cuscus, indeed, it appeared to be simply the thick- 

 ened lower margin of the panniculus, the connection between them 

 is so intimate. " 



It appears to me almost unquestionable that, as implied in the 

 above statement, the posterior slips of the more deeply inserting 

 pectoral mass are phylogenetically different from the more anterior 

 portion of the same layer. The opinions just quoted as to 

 the derivation from panniculus or latissimus, may each of them be 

 correct in different types, but the structure of the present specimen 

 suggested to me an explanation, a development of the idea of Owen, 

 which seems to be sustained by the series of Carnivora, and which 

 would well explain the oblique position of these posterior elements. 



According to this view, the structure in the polar bear w^ould in- 

 dicate that an originally simple and unsegmented pectoralis major 

 muscle has gradually encroached backward upon the abdomen ; that 

 during this process its axillary border has become folded under and 

 acquired a retrogressive attachment to the humerus beneath the 

 parent mass ; that finally, the entire posterior border of the muscle

146 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



has become segmented off as a distinct band, which consequently 

 forms the posterior boundary of the p. major and the anterior border 

 of its involuted fold. 



Such an explanation would derive probability from the mechan- 

 ical relations of the parts. As the original pectoral mass travelled 

 backward, and its posterior border came, as in this specimen, to lie 

 more nearly in a longitudinal than in a transverse line, it would 

 encroach more and more upon the axilla, that is, it would deepen 

 the anterior axillary fold. As this fold began to project from the 

 general contour of the body, there would be a tendency, especially 

 during anterior extension of the arm, for it to be repressed by fold- 

 ing in, and the backward direction of this fold would be determined 

 by the general curve of the integument. Such involutions of the 

 posterior border of the pectoralis ma.jor occur in many mammals, 

 and often, as in the human subject, in a form which makes it ap- 

 pear improbable that they can have been the result of fusion. This 

 view is also favored in the present subject by the course of the deep 

 anterior thoracic ners'e, Avhich, as mentioned above, runs completely 

 around the concavity of the fold. 



Through the kindness of Dr. Harrison Allen, I was enabled to 

 examine the pectoral in a young Ursus americanus. In this spec- 

 imen the first striking character was the much greater thickness and 

 power of the entire mass. The concavity of the fold was partially 

 obliterated by narrow fasciculi extending between its Avails, but the 

 type of the polar bear was still easily seen ; the ventro-humeral slip 

 was much stouter and separated from the rest of the muscle by a 

 very distinct line. The p. minor was as in U. marithnus ; of the two 

 remaining divisions, the more posterior was so intimately fused with 

 the p. major, as to be scarcely distinguishable. The fasciculi run- 

 ning from inside the fold to the sternum, began to give the idea of a 

 separate muscle lying immediately behind the pectoralis minor, in 

 the same plane. The thoracic nerve ran about as before. 



In an alcoholic, probably new born, specimen of Melursus libyus 

 in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadel- 

 phia, the modification of these parts had gone so far that they closely 

 resembled the condition in the Cat, though still considerably simpler 

 than in that animal. The most superficial division was a narrow 

 ribbon (evidently the "first division of the pectoral" of Mivart,^ or 

 the cephalic " pecto-antebrachialis " of Wilder and Gage^) rising 



1 The Cat. 



* Anatomical Technology. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 147 



from the manubrium and running obliquely ontward and backward 

 to blend with the cephalo-humeral and insert in common with it on 

 the middle of the humerus. Beneath this and crossed obliquely by 

 it was a large square mass (" ectopectoralis " of "Wilder ; " second 

 division" of IMivart) which rose along somewhat less than the anterior 

 half of the sternum and inserted into the proximal half of the 

 humerus. 



Upon reflecting this, three deep divisions were exposed. The 

 most anterior, p. minor, rose on the middle third of the sternum, 

 and inserted as in the Ijear ; it would evidently correspond to that 

 section in the cat, which is termed by Mivart the " third division, " 

 and by Wilder the " entopectoralis, div. cephalica. " The next di- 

 vision, which immediately adjoined the last, rose along the remainder 

 of the sternum and posterior costal cartilages and inserted by apon- 

 eurosis into the pectoral ridge of the humerus at the middle of the 

 insertion of the " ectopectoral. " It occupied the position of the 

 "entopectoralis, div. caudalis " of Wilder and seems to correspond 

 to the pectoralis quartus of Marsupials. The thoracic nerve, coming 

 out behind the p. minor, ran backwards a short distance over the 

 surface of this muscle and then dipped into its substance where it 

 could be traced between two ill-defined laminae almost to its posterior 

 border. This muscle seems to be the realization of the tendency 

 which was showing itself in the two other bears. The position of the 

 mass, its partial separation into two laminae, the relation to these of 

 the thoracic nerve, and a certain greater obliquity of its antero- 

 external than its antero-internal fibres, all appear to indicate that 

 it is the representative of the involuted fold of the pectoralis major 

 of the polar bear, which has been split off from the main mass and 

 had its two layers nearly combined. Accoi'ding to the provisional 

 hypothesis of Wilder this division would be part of the pectoralis 

 minor, but the present comparisons indicate it rather to be an inde- 

 pendent derivative of the pectoralis major. 



The remaining slip, which was quite delicate, rose for a short 

 distance along the linea alba and inserted beneath the last, which 

 also received the insertion of the panniculus and a slip from the 

 latissimus dorsi. I suppose it to be the ventro-humeral division of 

 the two bears and to answer to the " xiphi-humeral " of the cat, 

 which would then, according to this theory, owe its origin to the 

 pectoralis major and not to the latissimus or panniculus. 




148 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1888. 



The " entopectoralis, div. caudalis " in the cat is penetrated by 

 the thoracic nerve in exactly the same manner as in this Melursus, 

 and would of course be assigned the same origin. 



Coraco-brachialis, as in the black bear, rises from the coracoid 

 process and as it passes over the head of the humerus, divides into a 

 deep belly (coraco-brachialis brevis), which inserts beneath the com- 

 mon tendon of the latissimus dorsi and teres major, and into a more 

 superficial strand, which, opposite the latissimus tendon, furth'^.r sub- 

 divides into a branch which joins the biceps (short head of biceps) 

 and another wliich runs to the internal condyle and ridge (coraco- 

 brachialis longus). 



Triceps shews only three distinct heads. The outer humeral head 

 has the form of a triangular prism, with a long sharp angle, which 

 penetrates deeply between the scapular head and the humerus, and 

 ends in a narrow plane truncation, which is closely applied through 

 the whole length of the arm against a similar plane surface on the 

 outer side of the inner humeral head. The two thus form an al- 

 most continuous mass. 



Anconeus rises in a triangle Avhose apex is four inches above the 

 condyles, and inserts on the entire width of the back of the olecranon 

 and for 21 inches on its outer side. It exhibits a splitting into two 

 layers which are separate along its outer border and unite at about 

 the axial line of the humerus. 



Epifrochleo-anconeKS small and narrow. 



Fore-arm. Flexor carpi idnaris. The ulnar head is four inches 

 long (distance from elbow to wrist being nine inches) and inserts by 

 fascia on the outside of the humeral head. The ulnar nerve is vis- 

 ible between the heads for only about one inch from the elbow and 

 then dips deeply between the humeral head and flexor profiindus. 



Flexor prof uudus rises by five heads, three from the internal con- 

 dyle, one from the radius and one from the ulna. 



Flexor sublimis rises from the internal condyle and proceeding 

 down the arm as a very broad band, ends in four stout, flat tendons, 

 which supply the four ulnar digits in the usual manner. Rising 

 from its ulnar side is a fusiform accessory muscle, four inches long, 

 •which ends in a slender tendon that fuses near the metacarpo-pha- 

 langeal joint with the under surface of the sublimis tendon going to 

 the 5th digit. Another accessory muscle rises from the most ulnar 

 of the three condylar heads of the flexor profundus, 2i in. from the 

 wrist; its bellv, 1 in. lonar, divides into two slender tendons, which 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 149 



fuse like the other ^ith the inferior surface of the sublirais tendons 

 of the 3rd and 4th digits. I have called the present muscle flexor 

 sublimis because of the direct continuance of its tendons into the 

 digits, the small accessory tendons seeming merely to insert upon the 

 under surface of the broader tendons of the large muscle. In the 

 cat, on the other hand, it is the accessory tendons which have a di- 

 rect connection with the phalanges, and the tendons of the long con- 

 dylar muscle, relatively more delicate and more intimately blended 

 with the palmar fascia than in the bear, appear to insert upon the 

 surface of the perforatus sheaths formed by the "accessory" mus- 

 cles. Mivart hence calls the long muscle "palmaris longus, " but 

 in the numerous and often reciprocal variations existing in the 

 palmaris longus, flexor sublimis and accessory flexor sublimis 

 throughout the mammalian series, questions of homology would ap- 

 pear to be very uncertain. 



Lumhricales four in number with their usual relations. 

 Supinator longus rises by two heads, one from the supinator ridge 

 immediately above the extensor carpi radialis, and the other, which 

 can be traced more than two-thirds of the way up the humerus, from 

 out the substance of the brachialis anticus. The two unite before 

 reaching the elbow, and the resultant belly runs down the fore-arm 

 as a ribbon about h in. wide, to insert by fascia on the lower end of 

 the radius. 



Supinator hrevis reaches to within 1 j in. of the distal end of the 

 radius. 



Extensor communis digitorum and extensor minimi digiti as in the 

 cat or black bear. 



Extensor indicis fused with ex. seeundi internodii pollicis. 

 Hand. According to the " typical arrangement " of intrinsic 

 niuscles, so admirably presented by Cunningham, the elements in 

 the hand are as follows : 



In the right hand the palmar layer consisted of adductor pollicis, 

 |in. wide, adductor indicis, f in., ad. annularis, I in., and ad. minimus, 

 t in. The adductor annularis Avas a very delicate slip and did not 

 appear in the left hand. Adductor minimus divides before reaching 

 the base of its digit into three portions, of which only one inserts into 

 the digit ; of the other two, the more radial ends in a long tendon, 

 which runs toward the end of the digit to insert into the extensor 

 tendon, and the ulnar turns directly backwards and inserts fleshily, 

 also into the extensor system, opposite the end of the metacarpal. 




150 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



The intermediate and dorsal layers are closely fused, as in Car- 

 nivora generally. The combined systems apparently send a flexor 

 hrevis head to the sesamoid and phalanx, on each side of each digit, 

 but the exact homology of the long tendons which run back to the 

 extensor system is, with the exception of abductor minimi digiti, not 

 easily interpreted. These latter are two to every digit, one on each 

 side, and as a rule, show no superiority in size or distinctness on 

 either side ; they are inserted into the extensor tendon near the end 

 of the finger, and are commonly derived from that portion of the 

 muscle which lies nearest the bone, so that they wind around the 

 palmar surface of the flexor brevis in their course. Which represent 

 interossei and which do not, is not plain. 



In the pollex, the long tendon of the radial side inserts partly on 

 the base of the proximal phalanx, and partly continues as a cord, 

 which quickly changes to yellow elastic tissue and inserts into the 

 distal phalanx as a retractor ligament, in common with the main ex- 

 tensor tendon. On the ulnar side the corresponding band seems to 

 contract no tendinous union with the proximal phalanx, but contin- 

 ues directly to the distal as the elastic retractor ligament — very 

 suggestive facts, especially as most of the " long tendons " in the other 

 fingers terminate in the extensor system just at the point where the 

 retractor ligaments commence, while in the foot as mentioned below, 

 several of them are more or less continuous with the retractors. 



In the minimus the place of the ulnar long tendon is taken by the 

 abductor mimirni digiti, which rises from the pisiform bone and ac- 

 quiring scarcely any union with the phalanx, inserts into the tendon 

 of the extensor minimi digiti. The long tendon on the radial side 

 is more delicate than usual. 



The flexor brevis pollicis and the outer flexor muscle of the 3rd, 

 each derive, in the left hand at least, a small head of origin from 

 the adductor mass. 



Hip and Leg. Of the proximal muscles, only a few show points 

 worthy of mention. 



Gluteus maximus sends both of its divisions to the great trochan- 

 ter, there being no continuation by fascia down the thigh. 



Gemellus anterior remains distinct from the tendon of the obtura- 

 tor internus, and inserts separately into the anterior border of the 

 great trochanter in common with the pyriformis. The posterior 

 gemellus, however, joins the obturator tendon, and is quite distinct 

 from the anterior. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 151 



Semi-membranosus, as usual, sends its tibial tendon under the in- 

 ternal lateral ligament, which, in position, is mainly continuous with 

 the peroneus quinti digiti. 



Extensor ionc/us digitorum exhibits more surface on the front or 

 the leg than the tibialis anticus, which latter extends under it as a 

 thin sheet. The tendon of origin of the extensor perforates the 

 capsule of the knee joint to rise in front of the outer condyle of the 

 femur. 



Peroneus longns rises partly on the fibula, partly on the tibia, ex- 

 tending its origin under the ex. longus digitorum. 



Plantaris rises as usual from the external femoral condyle in com- 

 mon Avith the gastrocnemius, but contracts no union with that muscle 

 on its way down the leg. In passing over the heel into the foot, it 

 is much less firmly tied to the calcaueum than is the case in the cat. 



Soleus rises almost entirely from the tibia. 



Gastrocnemius. The inner head rises from a pit behind the inter- 

 nal condyle of the femur, extending up under the insertion of the 

 semi-membranosus, and showing no sesamoid bone. The outer head 

 has its origin in common with the plantaris from the femur and 

 sesamoid above the external condyle, sending also a delicate tendi- 

 nous band, } in. wide, over the sesamoid to the patella. 



These two heads extend about half way to the heel and then run 

 out into a common thin aponeurosis, which is joined 2 5 in. above 

 the heel by the narrow tendon of the biceps, and then thickening it- 

 self, receives the soleus, as already stated ; on the inner side it be- 

 comes especially thick, forming a distinct cord, which near the heel 

 crosses the tendo Achillis to the outer side. 



In dissecting these muscles I was impressed with the smallness of 

 the gastrocnemius in the bear as compared with that in the digiti- 

 grade Carnivora, and Avas reminded that I had been much more 

 struck by the same circumstance about a year ago, while dissecting 

 the limbs of the Indian Elephant, in which animal, as is well known, 

 the gastrocnemius is of singularly slight dimensions. The physiolog- 

 ical reason for such a relation in these two plantigrade animals, 

 where the heel does not have to be kept off the ground by a contin- 

 uous muscular exertion, is evident, and I regret that no com- 

 parative weights of the masses in the elephant were preserved. 



I, however, selected a slightly built cat from a number preserved 

 in alcohol at the Biological Laboratory of the University of Penn- 

 sylvauia, and with it made comparisons in weight with the bear. 




152 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



The leg in each case was disarticulated at the knee and ankle, and 

 the crus thus obtained cleared from fascia and the extrinsic ham- 

 string muscles. The test was perhaps not entirely fair, as the cat 

 was probably older in proportion than the bear, but it was quite a 

 spare specimen and cannot have much increased the proper differ- 

 ence. 



The results were as follows: 



Ursus marithnus. 



100 % 



34-4 % 

 13-8 % 

 10-3 % 

 10-3 % 



100 % 



39-8 % 



26-5 % 



4-7 % 



8-6 % 



A large muscular cat gave 43*5 % for the gastrocnemial system 

 and 28'5 % for the gastrocnemius, so the difference is not great. 

 In the above examples, it will also be seen that in the bear the 

 gastrocnemius constitutes 40 % of its own system, while in the cat 

 it is 66-5 %. 



Foot. Extensor brevis dlgitorum divides into three muscular 

 bellies, of which the outer one sends a tendon to the outer side of the 

 4th digit, the next divides into two tendons which supply the inner 

 side of the 4th and the outer side of the 3rd, and the third similarly 

 divides to supply the outer side of the 2nd and the hallux. As 

 usual, the peroneus quinti digiti takes the place of the short extensor 

 in the 5th digit. 



Flexor brevis slips to the index and medius come from a muscular 

 belly, but on the outer side, the muscle has degenerated iiito a broad 

 thick aponeurosis, so that the tendons to the 4th and 5th do not run 

 back into muscle, but are continuous through this fibrous mass with 

 the plantaris tendon. 



Accessorins rises on the posterior and external edges of the calca- 

 neum and inserts on the deep flexor tendon formed by the union of 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 153 



flexor longus digitorum and flexor longus hallucis. Its muscular 

 fibres are restricted to the side of the foot, all that portion on the 

 sole being tendinous. 



Lumbricales four, as usual ; the one inserting in the fifth digit 

 rises from the 4th deep tendon. 



Rising from the 5th deep flexor tendon, beside the lumbricals, is a 

 similar but somewhat longer belly, which blends with the 5th flexor 

 brevis tendon. This seems to correspond to what Mivart describes 

 as " accessorius " in the third and fourth digits of the cat.^ The cat, 

 however, has a distinct accessorius similar to the one in the present 

 specimen. 



In the plantar layer of adductores we have adductor hallucis, ad. 

 indicis, and ad. minimi digiti, which rise in common from the bases 

 of the 2nd and 3rd metatarsals and are united for a third of the way 

 out towards the phalanges. The adductor minimi digiti soon di- 

 vides into two heads, of which the outer inserts into the inner side 

 of the distal end of the 5th metatarsal, constituting the opponens 

 minimi digiti. The other head again divides into two slips, of which 

 the more distal becomes the normal adductor, Avhile the more prox- 

 imal runs around to blend with the extensor system at the metatarso- 

 phalangeal joint. 



The intermediate and dorsal systems are fused, as in the hand, 

 and terminate in a similar manner. Flexor lirevis slips appear to 

 be given to each side ot each digit ; the flexor brevis hallucis rises by 

 a number of small heads from the cuneiform and ligaments at the 

 base of the hallux. 



In the dorsal system there is a slender abductor ossis metatarsi 

 minimi digiti, from the postero-external part of the plantar surface 

 of the calcaneum to the tuberosity at the root of the 5th metatarsal, 

 and a stout abductor minimi digiti, which was much cut on both 

 sides by the skinning. 



The " long tendons " described in the hand appear on both sides 

 of each digit except the 1st and 5th. There is none on the outer 

 side of the 5th, its place being taken by the regular abductor, and 

 there appeared to be no representative on the tibial side of the hallux 

 in either foot, though the mutilation of that region in the skinning 

 might have destroyed it. That on the fibular side of the hallux in- 



1 I have recently seen a cat which lacked the connecting muscles in the third 

 and fourth digits and possessed one on the fifth, thus repeating the structure shown 

 here in the polar bear.

serts partly into the proximal phalanx, sending also a few fibres to 

 the extensor tendon at that point, and partly continues as a yellow 

 elastic cord to form the retractor ligament of that side. 



The relation of these long tendons to the retractor ligaments was 

 also more or less evident in the other digits, especially in the 4th of 

 one foot. On the outer side of that digit the long tendon, after giv- 

 ing a slip to the extensor system at the metatarso-phalangeal joint, 

 ran on to join the extensor tendon near its insertion, but before do- 

 ing this gave off a broad band which blended with the entire width 

 of the normal retractor ligament of that side. On the inner side the 

 long tendon joined the extensor, but some fibres immediately left it 

 again to become elastic and form the dorsal border of the retractor 

 ligament.

EESEARCHES UPON THE GENERAL PHYSIOLOGY OF NERVE 

 AND MUSCLE. 



BY Dr. HENRY C. CHAPMAN AND Dr. ALBERT P. BRUBAKER. 



No. 2. 



Resistance offered by Nerve and Muscle to the passage of an Elec- 

 trical Current. It was shown by the authors in a previous communi- 

 cation made to the Academy, No. 1, that both muscle and nerve are the 

 seats of electro-motive force amounting in the case of muscle to the 

 0-0696, of nerve to the 0-0237 of a Daniell, capable of deflecting the 

 magnet of a Wiedemann galvanometer as indicated by the scale to 

 an extent of 217 and 21 divisions respectively. Now since the 

 current after passing from the muscle or nerve to and through the 

 galvanometer, in returning to the point from which it started, must 

 pass through the muscle or nerve, it becomes a matter of importance 

 as well as of interest to determine the resistance offered by the latter 

 which must be overcome by the muscle and nerve current as the 

 internal resistance of the battery must be overcome in order that the 

 electrical circuit may be completed. The method made use of 

 by the authors in determining the resistance offered by muscle, 

 nerve etc. to the passage of an electrical current is that known as 

 the Wheatstone bridge method, a brief account of which is indis- 

 pensable to the proper understanding of the apparatus to be presently 

 described and by which the results to be communicated were ob- 

 tained. To illustrate the theory of the Wheatstone bridge let us 

 T suppose that a current 



from a Daniell element D 

 enters the ^vire A B Fig. 

 1 at A, the wire being 



A I 1>4i — >- ^B graduated into 1000 parts 



and along which the slid- 

 er S can be moved ; such 

 being the case if the slider 

 be pushed along the wire 

 Fi~i. close up to A, then of the 



current entering at A, part returns through the galvanometer G and 

 part returns through A S B to the Daniell element whence it came. 




156 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



Suppose, however, that the slider be pushed from B only as far as S, 

 then the current entering at A will divide into two branch currents 

 passing respectively to S and X. The one branch current on reach- 

 ing S will subdivide again into two currents one of Avhich will return 

 through S B to the Daniell element the other passing into the galva- 

 nometer G and deflecting the needle to the left for example, supposing 

 it to be unopposed by the current which we shall see passes into the 

 galvanometer G in the opposite direction from T. The other branch 

 current on passing through X, the muscle or nerve whose resistance 

 is to be determined, on reaching T will similarly divide into tw'o 

 currents, one of which passing through the resistance box R will re- 

 turn through B to the Daniell element ; the other passing into the 

 galvanometer will deflect the needle to the right supposing it to be 

 unopposed by that passing into the galvanometer G from S in the 



opposite direction. The resis- 

 tance box just referred to. Fig. 

 2, is so called on account of 

 its offering a resistance to the 

 passage of an electrical cur- 

 rent the amount of resistance 

 offered being determined by 

 Pjjj 2,^''^''''^ the number of plugs out. Let 



us suppose for example, the slider being at B, that we make 

 the resistance box offer a resistance of 100 ohms (1) by taking 

 out the plug numbered 100, Fig. 2 a, the eflTect of this will be 

 that of the current which would otherwise return through R to the 

 Daniell, part now passes into the galvanometer and deflects the nee- 

 dle to the right. Let now, how-ever, the slider be moved from B to S, 

 that is to exactly the middle of the wire or to its 500th division, it 

 will be observed that the needle of the galvanometer G is deflected 

 back to zero, proving that of the current which, when the slider was 

 at B, returned to the Daniell element, part now passes into the 

 galvanometer G opposite in direction to that passing in the galva- 

 nometer from T, but with an equal electro-motive force since the 

 needle of the galvanometer is brought to zero. Let us suppose in 

 order to illustrate graphically the relation of the forces involved in 



An ohm is the resistence offered by a copper wire 1 mm. in diameter and 

 46'25 mm. in length.

the preceding experiment that the vertical line A E Fig. 3 repre- 

 sents the electro-motive force of the current a.s it enters A Fig. 1 

 from the Daniell and that the horizontal line A S B Fig. 3 represents 

 tlie resistance offered by the wire A S B Fig. 1, S representing in 

 Fig. 3 the point where the current passes into the galvanometer 

 from S in Fig. 1, S G in Fig. 3 will then represent the electro-motive 

 force of the current at the point S. It need hardly be added that 

 S G must be shorter than A E since the electro-motive force at S is 

 necessarily less than at A, the electro-motive force diminishing 

 gradually from A to B. Similarily A E Fig. 4 representing the 

 electro-motive force at A Fig 1, let A T B represent the resistance 

 offered by A X R B Fig. 1 to the passage of the current. The line 

 A T B Fig. 4 being shorter than the line A S B, the resistance being 



greater, the elec- 

 tro-motive force 

 will be diminished 

 more suddenly and 

 the point T where 

 the current from T 

 Fig, 1 passes into 

 B the galvanometer 

 will consequently 

 be nearer A, and T G Fig. 

 4, will then represent the 

 electro-motive force at that 

 point and being equal to the 

 electro-motive force at S Fig. 

 3 it must be equal to S G. 

 But if S G be equal to T G, 

 which must necessarily be 

 Fig. 4. the case since they represent 



the electro-motive forces through whose equal and opposed effects 

 the galvanometer needle remains at zero, it follows that A T : T B 

 : : A S : S B or what is the same thing that X : R : : A S : S B (1). 

 Substituting in (1) the values of R, A S, S B as experimentally 

 determined and we obtain X : 100 : : 500 : 500 or X = 100 ohms. 

 That is to say that X the nerve or muscle offers a resistance to the 

 passage of an electrical current that is equal to 100 ohms. In deter-

mining the resistance offered by muscle and nerve to a current of 

 electricity as in the case of the determination of the electro-motive 



force of the same, 

 the authors made 

 use however of the 

 round compensa- 

 tor Fig. 5 with 

 Christiani's modi- 

 fication, that is 

 with the addition 

 of the binding 

 screw O, a much 

 more reliable and 

 convenient instru- 

 ment than the 

 long rheocord. 

 The relations ex- 

 isting between the 

 resistance to be 

 determined or X 

 and that of the 

 resistance box R 

 and the portions 

 of the wire A S 

 S B on either side 

 of the wheel S 

 are, however, pre- 

 cisely the same as 

 in the case of the 

 long rheocord since in both cases the ratio obtains of X : R : : A S 

 : S B as may be at once seen by a comparison of Figs. 5 and 1. 



In order that the amovmt of muscular and nervous tissue used in 

 the different experiments should be the same the authors made use 

 of the method employed by Hermann (1) of enclosing the tissue 

 between two plates (in the present instance of ebonite instead of 

 glass) to the four corners of one of which were cemented pegs so 

 that when the other plate rested on the latter a definite space was 

 included. It would have been desirable if practicable that the same 

 amount of nerve had been used as muscle but on account of the 

 scarcity of frogs, the season being winter and the great number of 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 159 



sciatic nerves that would have been required to have filled up the 

 space, amounting in the case of the muscle to 2 cent, in length and 

 breadth and 1 mm in thickness, a smaller space was made use of in 

 the case of nerve, namely of 2 cent, in length 1 cent, in breadth and 

 0'5 mm in thickness. It will be observed from the tabulated results 

 given below of the resistance offered by muscle and nerve to the pas- 

 sage of an electrical current, that the resistance varied with the 

 amount of the resistance offered by that of the resistance box. At 

 first sight it might appear that such variations vitiated entirely the 

 result. It must be borne in mind, however, that the polarization due 

 to the passage of the current through the tissue offers a resistance 

 as well as the tissue itself and that this polarization varies with the 

 current, the latter varying in turn according to the resistance box. 

 Such being the case the variations in the resistance offered by the 

 same amount of tissue according as the resistance of the resist- 

 ance box is modified, may be attributed to the polarization set up in 

 the tissue. It may be mentioned incidentally in this connection that 

 in the absence of a round compensator the resistance of muscle, 

 nerve etc. can be determined, though not so conveniently or accurately, 

 by means of that form of resistance box in which the latter is provided 

 with the Wheatstone bridge arrangement as represented in Fig. 6 and 



■which was made use of by the authors with the view of comparing the 

 results as obtained by it and by the compensator. After what has 

 been said as to the general theory of determining resistance it will be

seen that by this particular method the proportion of X : R : : AS 

 : S B obtains as when the round compensator is used, the only- 

 difference being that in making at once A S = S B, the value of X 

 is inferred from that of R. In conclusion it may be pointed out 

 that while the resistance offered by the human body to the passage 

 of an electrical current is very great in a state of health, it appear? 

 to be diminished in a state of disease, notably in Graves disease, in- 

 deed so much so as to constitute an important diagnostic symptom 

 of that condition.

 muscle.

DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERS OF ODONTASPIS LITTORALIS. 

 BY JOSEPH LEIDY, M. D. 



In the collection of the Academy is a shark, 8i feet long, which 

 ^as caught some years ago at Beesley's Point, New Jersey. I was 

 present when the shark was caught, and helped to land it and pre- 

 pare the skin and jaws for preservation. Attached to the shark were 

 a number of lemean parasites, subsequently to be described. Re- 

 cently, wishing to know the exact name of the shark, I determined 

 it to be the Odonta^pis littoralbi, but found its distinctive characters 

 rather vaguely indicated by authorities. The shark is not uncom- 

 mon on our coast; and is commonly called the "man-eater." In 

 color it is iron grey above, paler at the sides and dusky white beneath. 

 In the form, relative position of the fins, and other external characters, 

 it clearly accords with the figure 1, of plate 36, of Storer's Fishes of 

 Massachusetts, referred to Carcharias griseus of Ayres. In the fig- 

 ure the branchial clefts are represented as being placed well in 

 advance of the pectoral fin, as in our specimen, and not close to the 

 latter as indicated by Miiller and Henle in the figure of Odontaspis 

 taurus. 



Dr. Abbott (Proc. 1861, 400), in describing our specimen named it 

 Odontaspis americanus and gives the dental characters as follows : — 

 ■" Teeth with a single toothlet on either side, but occasionally one 

 wanting. Upper and lower first tooth smaller than the adjoining 

 teeth ; then follow above two very long teeth ; then another pair of 

 ;Somewhat smaller teeth ; then two somewhat increase in length ; then 

 the remainder gradually decrease. In the lower jaw the teeth grad- 

 ually decrease from the first pair. " 



Prof. Gill, in a Synopsis of the Eastern American Sharks, (Proc. 

 1864, 260,) names the same species Eugomphodus littoralis, and gives 

 as its synonyms /S^tia/ws americanus, littoralis and macrodus of Mitch- 

 ell ; Carcharias littoralis, Dekay ; C. griseus, Ayres ; Eugomphodus 

 griseus, Gill ; and Odontaspis americanus, Abbott. He says that 

 Eugomphodus is distinguished from Carcharias (Raf ), Triglochis or 

 Odontaspis "by the simple fii'st and fourth teeth of the upper jaw, as 

 ^vell as the first of the lower. " 



Giinther, in the Catalogue of Fishes in the British Museum, names 

 the same shark Odontaspis americanus, and includes the other names 

 above given as synonymous, to which is added the Odontaspis taurus 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 163 



of Miiller and Henle. He gives as characters of the dentition, 

 " upper first tooth not smaller than the second ; one or two small 

 teeth between the upper third and fourth long teeth ; large teeth 

 with a single small cusp on each side. As localities, he gives the 

 Atlantic and South Pacific. 



Jordan and Gilbert, in the Synopsis of the Fishes of North Amer- 

 ica, for Odontasjns littoralis, also include all the other names men- 

 tioned as synonymous except the 0. taurus. As distinctive characters 

 they adopt the diagnosis oi Eugomphodus of Gill — "first and fourth 

 teeth of the upper jaw and first of the lower simple, without basal 

 cusps. " Miiller and Henle gives as charactei"s of Odontaspls taurus 

 " upper first tooth smaller ; then follow two very long teeth ; then one 

 or two smaller ones ; then again large ones from which they grad- 

 ually decrease. The lower teeth gradually decrease from the second." 

 Besides the specimen of Odontaspis littoralis from Beesley's Point, 

 we have at command half a dozen sets of jaws of the same species. 

 Of these one is from Nantucket, and another from Townsend's Inlet, 

 N. J. ; the others have no locality marked. In all the essential 

 characters of the dentition are alike ; but they do not accord with 

 those which have been given as distinctive of the species. The 

 number of teeth varies according as there are a few or more of the 

 rudimentary ones at the ends of the series, but this is a difference of 

 no diagnostic value as a like variation occurs on the two sides of the 

 same jaw. In all our specimens, without exception, the teeth are 

 provided with a pair of denticles ; none being simple as intimated 

 by Gill, and by Gilbert and Jordan, in the diagnosis of Eugompho- 

 dus. The anterior teeth in general are long, narrow, and sigmoid, 

 and their denticles are curved. The more posterior, lateral and 

 larger teeth are shorter than the former and proportionately wider, 

 and have also shorter and wider denticles. In different specimens 

 they exhibit a variable disposition to the production of a second 

 smaller denticle. In five of the sets of jaws in which the teeth are 

 well displayed throughout, w^e find the following range of numbers : 



19—17, 19—22, 20—18 , 22—23, 24—24. 



18—18 18—17 18—14 19—19 22—24 

 The distinctive dental charactei*s are as follows : — In the upper 

 jaw, three large teeth, of which the first and third are nearly equal 

 and the second is slightly larger ; fourth tooth very small, about 

 one third the size of the former ; then follows a considerable hiatus ; 

 fifth to the seventh teeth nearly equal and smaller than the third

tooth ; the remaining teeth successively decreasing. In the under 

 jaw the first tooth is small, about one-half the size of the next, ^Yhich 

 is the largest ; and then the others successively decrease. 



Miiller and Henle, Abbott, and Giinther intimate that in Odon- 

 taspis, in the upper dental series, there are one or two small teeth 

 after the third large tooth. In none of our specimens are there two 

 small teeth in this position, but after the single small tooth there is 

 a hiatus, in different jaws ranging from a third to more than half an 

 inch, which presents no trace of a tooth. This hiatus is unusual in 

 the dental series of sharks ; and it perhaps gave rise to the inference 

 and consequent assertion that it is normally occupied by a second 

 small tooth. In the figure of the dentition of Odontaspis taurus as 

 given by Miiller and Henle, notwithstanding their statement, a single 

 small tooth appears after the upper third large tooth, in accordance 

 with what we observe in 0. littoralis. In 0. taurtis, the first tooth 

 in both jaws is represented as being nearly equal and about a third 

 less than the adjoining teeth ; and the upper third and lower second 

 teeth appear as the largest of the series.

PARASITIC CRUSTACEA. 

 BY JOSEPH LEIDY, M. D. 



Attached to the Shark, Odontaspis littoralis, caught at Beesley's 

 Point, N. J., above indicated, on each side of the mouth, hanging 

 from the upper lip, were a number of lernean parasites, and these 

 were thickly covered with a hydroid parasite. The lernean appears 

 to be an undescribed species, and may therefore be distinguished by 

 the following name and characters. 

 Lerneonema procera. 



Animal pale yellowish. Head horizontal, semi-oval, convex 

 above, with three, short, blunt occipital tubercles, fore part convex, 

 excavated beneath and enclosing the mouth, antennae and maxilli- 

 peds ; neck long, linear, cylindrical ; body short, fusiform, and trun- 

 cated behind ; tail longer than the body, linear, cylindrical. Egg 

 pouches, long, linear, cylindrical. Length 70 mm. ; including egg 

 pouches 90 mm. Head 3 mm. long ; neck 30 to 45 mm. long, 0*375 

 thick ; body 10 to 12 mm. long, 1*75 thick ; tail 12 to 15 mm. long, 

 0'5 thick. Egg pouches 20 mm. long, 0'25 thick. 



The hydromedusarium appears to belong to Eucope parasitica, 

 found in the same manner, by A. Agassiz, on a lernean of Ortha- 

 goriscus mola. Some of the stems rise from the creeping root from 

 5 to 8 millimeters, with short branches, two or three ringed. The 

 polyp-cups are 0*375 mm. long by 0*25 wide. The stems are O'l 

 mm. thick, and the alternate lateral branches about 0*2 long. 



From the fin of a Shark, also caught at Beesley's Point., but the 

 name not ascertained, there was obtained a single specimen of a 

 lernean, which nearly resembles the Perrisopus dentahis, of Steen- 

 strup and Liitken. It is 5 mm. long. The cephalothorax is a little 

 smaller than the abdominal segment, and between them are three 

 pairs of dorsal lobes which completely cover the space. The egg 

 pouches are linear and 0*25 mm. thick.

The President, Dr. Leidy, in the chair. 

 Twenty-six persons present. 



Parasites of the Rock Fish. — Dr. Leidy stated that he recently had 

 examined the gills and entrails of a Rock-fish, Lahrax lineatm, 

 weighing 20 pounds, on which he made the following remarks. The 

 gills were swarming with the little crustacean parasite Ergasilus 

 lahracis. In many of these the thorax and egg-sacs were opaque 

 milk-white, but in most of them the latter were more translucent 

 and of a blue color. This difference is due to the development of the 

 embryos, within which there appears blue pigment. 



Attached to the gills there were three opaque milk-white fluke- 

 worms and a fourth of the same kind was embedded in the muscular 

 coat of the pharynx. These appear to pertain to an undescribed 

 species, and may therefore be distinguished by the following name 

 and description : — 



DiSTOMUM GALACTOSOMUM. Opaque milk-white, depressed, spat- 

 ulate, narrowest in advance, obtusely rounded at both extremities, 

 dorsally convex, ventrally flat. Head rounded truncate or trans- 

 versely oval discoid, with prominent margin, unarmed ; neck short, 

 slightly widening to the ventral acetabulum, which is sessile, larger 

 than the oral acetabulum, and with its orifice appearing triangular ; 

 posterior part of the body elliptical, in movement expanding and 

 becoming thinner and translucent, and concave beneath with 

 the opaque white intestine on each side shining through. At rest 

 about 6 mm. long by 2 mm. wide ; elongating to 12 mm. by 2*5 mm. 

 Avide posteriorly, and 1 mm. at the base of the neck. 



After being killed in dilute alcohol, the specimens remained of 

 spatulate shape, 6 to 8 mm. long, 2 mm. wide behind. The oral 

 acetabulum 0"625 broad ; the ventral acetabulum situated 1*375 

 mm. back of the summit of the head, was 0"875 broad. 



When the animal was in motion and expanded the posterior por- 

 tion of the body to such an extent as to render it translucent, the 

 intestine on each side became especially conspicuous through its 

 white opacity. The intestines extended directly from the minute 

 pharynx to the caudal extremity, more or less tortuous according to 

 the degree of elongation or shortening of the animal. They are * 

 widest back of the ventral acetabulum and are sacculated. In the 

 expanded condition of the body, by transmitted light, it exhibited a 

 minutely reticular appearance, the lines of the rete being more opaque 

 white and apparently according with a capillary net communicating 

 laterally with the vessels proceeding from the caudal vesicle. The 

 opaque white appearance of the body seems to be due to the presence 

 of granules of calcium carbonate, for the application of acetic acid 

 caused their disappearance with the evolution of bubbles of gas, and 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 167 



the body became more uniformly translucent, without however af- 

 fecting the white opacity of the intestines. The generative apparatus 

 appears to be undeveloped, as no distinct organs were observable. 

 At the middle of the posterior portion of the body, in the usual posi- 

 tion of the testes, there appeared a single clearer spot, and in advance 

 of it a clearer streak. The character of these he had not determined. 



Many worms, the Echinorhynchus proteus, clung to the interior of 

 the intestine its whole length, but they were not so numerous as, nor 

 larger than, they are commonly found to be in smaller individuals 

 of the same fish. 



Of two other large Rock-fish examined, weighing each about a 

 dozen pounds, one was free of parasites of all kinds, and in the other 

 there were only a few of the little crustacean, Ergasilus, adhering to 

 the gills; and within the abdominal cavity, adherent to the stomach,, 

 closely coiled and encysted, a dozen nematoid worms, the Agamo- 

 nema capsidaria, a common parasite of the shad and herring. Neither 

 of the fish contained a single Echinorhynchus, a remarkable cir- 

 cumstance, for he had never before examined a Rock-fish without 

 finding this parasite present. 



Louse of the Pelican. — Prof. Leidy remarked that the admirable 

 monograph of E. Piaget, " Les Pediculines," a large work with sup- 

 plement, in 3 quarto volumes, illustrated, and published in Leydeu' 

 from 1880 to 1885, presented to night, had reminded him that he 

 had formerly made a communication to the Academy on an insect of 

 the kind, which was remarkable on account of its living in the pouch 

 of the Pelican. A brief description of the louse, under the name of 

 Menopon perale is given in the Proceedings 1878, p. 100. Mr. Piaget 

 describes two species of Menopon from Pelicans, 3L titan, living on 

 Pelicanus onocrotalus and M. consanguineum, which he observes ap- 

 pears by preference to infest the interior of the great pouch of P. 

 erythrorhynchus. He remarks of the latter that it probably has some 

 relation with Menopon perale, and regrets the insufficient description 

 of this species for comparison. Prof. Leidy continued that M. Piaget's 

 figures of Menopon titan and M. consanguinetim appear so nearly 

 alike and resemble so closely M. perale that from his own judgment, 

 he would have regarded them as all of one species. In 1878 he had 

 prepared a more detailed description with figures of Menopon perale, 

 intended for publication in one of the government reports, but as it 

 was not called for, it was forgotten until he was reminded of it by the 

 appearance of the great work of M. Piaget. Menopon perale was 

 named from specimens submitted to him by Prof Wyman, who ob- 

 tained it from the pouch of Pelica)ius traehyrhynchus, in Florida, and 

 others obtained by Dr. E. Coues, from the same bird, on the Red 

 River, near Pembina, Dakota. Dr. Coues in his " Birds of the 

 North West," U. S. Geol. Surv. 1874, 587, says of the White Pel- 

 ican : " I took a female in very poor flesh, with worn, harsh, plu- 

 mage, which was attributable to a disease of the pouch. On the 




168 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



inside of this organ were fastened in patches, great numbers of a 

 iouse, which produced an induration, ulceration, and finally pei-for- 

 ation of the membrane." 



The characters of 3Ienopon perale as drawn from his original 

 manuscript are as follow : Head wider than long, transverse reni- 

 form, pale brown with a darker patch and a crescentoid black spot 

 Tsetween the clypeus and temple, fringed in front with short hairs, 

 with a longer tuft at the posterior lateral lobe, and a row of eight 

 along the posterior concave border. Antennse concealed beneath the 

 head, with the terminal joint largest and oval. Maxillary palpi 

 cylindrical, reaching to the lateral border of the head, four-jointed. 

 Mandibles strong, deeply two-toothed, black. Eyes two, close 

 together on each side at the lateral border of the head. Prothorax 

 narrower than the head, rounded hexagonal in outline and produced 

 laterally in a strong conical point, pale brown above with a darker 

 band crossing the middle and darker at the lateral borders, smooth. 

 Metathorax as wide as the head, bell-shaped in outline, with lateral 

 rounded angles ; crossed by a row of hairs. Limbs well produced ; 

 anterior femora short and robust ; the posterior two nearly twice as 

 long as the former and darker brown in color. Tibiae with a spur 

 at the distal extremity. Tarsus with an ovate appendage at the 

 proximal extremity, and a single hair at the distal extremity. Un- 

 gues strong, black. Abdomen long elliptical, nearly twice the length 

 of the head and thorax and widest at the fourth segment. Segments 

 of nearly equal length, the last one mammiliform, all with a wide 

 chestnut brown band, and a row of short hairs emanating from clear 

 circular bases. Last segment with an additional tuft of hairs on 

 each side. 



Entire length 2\ lines ; color translucent whitish and transversely 

 striped with chestnut brown. Smaller individuals paler in color 

 with narrower stripes of brown. 



In an individual 4"75 mm. long, the head was 0"75 long and 1 

 mm. broad ; the prothorax 0"55 long and 0'825 broad ; the meta- 

 thorax 0'625 long and 1 mm. broad ; the abdomen 2"875 long and 

 1'25 m. broad. 



Attached singly or in groups up to fifteen or more between the 

 folds of the lining membrane of the pouch of Pelicanus trachyrhyn- 

 chus. 



The President was authorized to execute on behalf of the Academy 

 an acceptance of a Deed of Trust, by which Mrs. Emma AV. Hayden 

 conveys to the Society in trust the sum of $2500.00, to be known as 

 the Hayden Memorial Geological Fund, in commemoration of her 

 husband the late Prof Ferdinand V. Hayden M. D., LL.D. 



According to the terms of the deed, a bronze medal and the bal- 

 ance of the interest arising from the fund are to be awarded annually 

 for the best publication, exploration, discovery or research in the

 thereof as may be designated. The award and all matters connected 

 therewith are to be determined by a committee to be selected in an 

 appropriate manner by the Academy.

Parasites of the Pickerel. — Dr. Leidy remarked that among the 

 numerous parasites which are mentioned as infesting the Pike, Esox 

 lucius, of Europe, no Ttenia is indicated. In the Pickerel, Esox retic- 

 ulatus brought to our market, a species of the latter appears to be 

 common. In two fishes he found half a dozen, in the intestine and 

 stomach; and in another a single individual two feet in length. It 

 resembles closely the Taenia ambloplitis, noticed in the Rock Bass, 

 Amhloplitis r^ipestris (Proc, 1887, 23) and may be the same. Dis- 

 tinguishing it with the name of Taenia leptosoma, its characters 

 are as follow : Body long, and thin, and at the fore-part thread- 

 like. Head unarmed, without rostellum, with four equidistant 

 hemispherical bothria ; neck very short or none ; anterior segments 

 transversely linear, many times wider than long ; posterior segments 

 gradually becoming proportionately longer and quadrate and barrel 

 shaped ; genital apertures marginal, alternating irregularly. Ova 

 spherical. 



Length from six to nine and twenty six inches, shortening to one- 

 half or less ; breadth to 2 and 2"5 mm. Head 0"25 to 0*5 mm. broad ; 

 bothria 0"125 to 0'175 mm. Anterior segments an inch from the 

 head 0'175 mm. long by 1 mm. broad ; posterior segments 0*5 to 

 0-75 mm. long by 2 to 2-5 mm. broad. Ova 0*028 to 0-032 mm. in 

 diameter. 



A single slender Scolex associated with the longest Tcenia was 4 

 mm. long by 0'25 wide, but elongated to 8 mm. by 0*1 wide. The 

 head Avas of the same form as that of the Tcenia. After being in 

 alcohol, the head of the Scolex was 0'225 mm. wide with the bothria 

 0*1 mm. in diameter. The posterior part of the body exhibited traces 

 of segmentation, with the segments 0'075 mm. long by 0*25 wide.

Upper Tertiary Invertebrates from West side of Chesapeake Bay. — 

 Dr. Otto Meyer made some remarks on Upper Tertiary inverte- 

 brates. Dr. Benjamin Sharp had given him for examination a 

 fipeciraen of Balanus concavus Bronn, which had been collected by 

 Dr. J. Alban Kite, on the west side of Chesapeake Bay. The 

 Balanus has a diameter of two inches. Its tergum has a long 

 spur as in the specimens of Balanus concavus from the English Crag; 

 the parietes, however, are smooth, while the Crag specimens are rib- 

 bed. The scutum is less elaborately sculptured than a scutum of 

 the same species from Yorktown Va. in his collection. 



The inside of this Balanus was filled with sand containing shells 

 etc. From this sand he had jjicked out the following species.

These determinations were made partly from fossil specimens in 

 Dr. Meyer's collection, partly from recent species in the collection 

 of the Academy and he is obliged to the Conservator of the Con- 

 <;hological Department of the Academy, Mr. H. A. Pilsbry, for 

 giving him the opportunity to compare them with the recent 

 :forms. The names are not intended to be the final ones, for most 

 •.species of shells have not only been described as recent forms but 

 they have frequently had other names as fossils given them, and 

 sometimes quite a number of names, and it will be a very great 

 task to determine the final synonymy of the tertiary and recent 

 species. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 171 



In two cases only did he try to give synonyms and definite 

 names. The species of Ccecxim of which he found nearly a dozen 

 specimens, agrees with a specimen of Cceciim anmdatum Emmons, 

 in the collection of the Academy, which species has been described 

 from the Tertiary of North Carolina. He was unable to distinguish 

 the form specifically from specimens of Ccecum pulchellum Stimpson, 

 from the Atlantic coast of America, and considers specimens of 

 ■Ccecum trachea ]\Iont., from the Atlantic coast of Europe as belong- 

 ing to the same species. 



Ceritklopsis clavulus H. C. Lea, sp., of which species he found a 

 specimen with smooth embryonic whorls in material from York- 

 town, Va., agrees with the recent Cerithiopsis terebralis Adams, 

 from the Atlantic coast, Florida specimens of which show three 

 and a half smooth embi'yonic whorls. If the nucleus of Cerithiopsis 

 terebralis should agree with the nucleus of the European Cerithiop- 

 sis trilineata Phil , the two species would be identical and the name 

 •of Phili])pi would have the priority. 



Aligena sharpi, n. sp. Convex, subrotund, somewhat oblong, 

 posterior margin slightly truncated. Beak small. Hinge Avith one 

 small cardinal tooth. Ligament internal in a shallow sulcation, 

 running from the beak past the dorsal margin obliquely posteriorly 

 and interiorly. Anterior muscular impression 

 elongated ; posterior muscular impression 

 Pallial line apparently entire. Surface 

 J ^ with iri'egular prominent striae of growth. 



Only the figured specimen w^as found. 

 The genus A ligena is not mentioned in the 

 Manuals of Conchology of Tryon and of Fisch- 



— . er. It was founded by H. C. Lea (Trans. 



— Amer. Philos. Soc. (2)" vol. IX, p. 238.) in 



1843, and was defined by him in the following way: — "Shell equi- 

 valve? subequilateral, closed posteriorly and anteriorly; hinge with 

 one cardinal tooth and a long shallow sulcation under the beaks. 

 The cardinal tooth is in general rather small. The sulcus appears 

 to have received the ligament. It commences at the beak and runs 

 obliquely past the dorsal margin into the cavity under the beak." 



The two species of H. C. Lea have been placed by the authors 

 after him, in the genus Kellia. In accordance with it Dr. Meyer 

 has (at another place) enumerated Kellia laevis H. C. Lea, among 

 the fossils which occur at Yorktowu Va. But an examination of 

 recent species of Kellia, especially of Kellia suborhicularis Mont., 

 made him believe that these Miocene shells should not be placed in 

 this genus. 



The two species Aligena leavis H. C. Lea, and Aligena striata 

 H. C. Lea, do not differ in shape from each other and are probably 

 identical. A. Sharpi, however, differs from them greatly in shape, 

 being more rounded and more inflated.

Notes on the JRelations of Structure and Function to Color 

 Changes in Spiders. — Rev. Br. Henry C. McCook submitted the 

 following remarks on color changes in spiders, which he wished to 

 be understood as in part, at least, tentative. They were intended to 

 evoke suggestions and helpful information from members of the 

 Academy and others, rather than to present final conclusions on a 

 most interesting subject. 

 I. On the Relation of Structure to Color he observed that : — 



1 The color of young spiders is almost without exception light 

 yellow, or green, whitish or livid, tints that blend very well with the 

 prevailing greens of foliage, young twigs and the grays of bark of 

 trees, of rocks and soil. This is due largely to the fact that the tis- 

 sues are at that time translucent, allowing a free play of light through 

 them. The effect is also, probably, caused by the absence of food in 

 the alimentary tract and lack of distribution of nutriment throughout 

 the system. 



As young spiders advance in age the color deepens, which is 

 caused no doubt by gradual hardening of the tissues, thus making 

 them more opaque. Up to this i^eriod no food has been taken, hence 

 the absence of food alone is not sufficient to account for the light 

 colors of the first stages after exode. Yellows and browns in vari- 

 ous tints occur at this period, and in some cases, not generally he 

 believed, color patterns which are chai'acteristic of the various spe- 

 cies in adult life begin to appear with more or less distinctness, or 

 at least suggestively. It is not until sedentary spiderlings have es- 

 tablished themselves upon their own webs, and so to speak, have set 

 up housekeeping for themselves, that the characteristic colors of the 

 species begin to appear with any positive degree of distinctness. 



2 As the spiders further advance in age and make their success- 

 ive moults, various color changes may be noted. Immediately after 

 moulting the color is always lighter, which is probably due to the 

 fact that the harder skin, just cast off, prevented the passage of light 

 through the tissues. The new skin is probably thinner, and more 

 translucent. Dr. McCook believed that moulting produces changes 

 in color patterns of a very decided kind, at least in certain species. 

 Apparently some organic change occurs which is the cause of this" 

 phenomenon. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 173 



3 In old age the color changes are very decided in almost all 

 species. In some, as Eperia trifolium and JFJpeira thaddeus, the 

 changes give added brilliancy to the color at certain parts of the 

 body. Some of the color changes of trifolium are very beautiful and 

 the same is true of thaddeus. 



But advanced age, as a rule, makes the colors darker. Orange 

 and brown then have a ruddier hue ; yellows darken into orange and 

 brown. Sometimes the yellow patterns are entirely lost, and the 

 spider becomes very dark, almost black. There is a grizzled appear- 

 ance about the animal in this stage which reminds one of the corre- 

 sponding condition of man and lower vertebrate animals. These 

 last named changes are manifest in the spider after the final deposit 

 of eggs. 



4 In gravid females the changes of color are often very decided. 

 Some of the bright colors upon trifoliwn and thaddeus are doubtless 

 due to this condition. Most spiders during gestation have a lighter 

 color, which may be the result of mechanical changes in structure. 

 The skin becomes distended and more transparent, the pigment is 

 thereby distributed, and thus centres of color are broken up and the 

 -color matter diffused. Not only the skin, but other parts of the ab- 

 domen are distended during gestation, and this distension produces 

 changes in the color of the animal by modifying in some way the 

 various secretions from the liver and other organs. 



5 The little pits or dark spots upon the dorsum of the abdomen 

 Avhich mark the attachment of the muscles within, appeared to him 

 to be centres for aggregation of coloring material. At least the 

 dorsal patterns seem to be grouped in some regular way around 

 these muscular attachments. Thus the action of the muscles on the 

 skin and chitinous shell or walls serves to compel certain aggrega- 

 tions along the lines of use, that form these colors and patterns. 

 It might be important in this connection to consider what is the 

 ordinary effect of muscular action upon the distribution of pigment 

 in the human system or with vertebrate animals?* 



The color rings or annuli around the joints of the limbs of spiders 

 may also be produced by action of the muscles. It is noticeable 

 that the tendency of these darker and more vivid colors is towards 

 the ends of the joints, as though by the outward action of the mus- 

 cles the pigment were forced mechanically or otherwise attracted 

 toward these points. 



In the cephalthorax may be noted the same tendency of color to 

 group itself around the points of muscular attachment, particularly 



* After the remarks here recorded, Dr. Nolan, the Secretary, called attention to 

 the fact that he then had in hand for publication a paper by Dr. Harrison Allen, 

 on " The Distribution of the Color Marks of the ^lammalia." This paper has 

 now appeared, and is a most valuable and interesting one. (See Proceed. Acad. Nat. 

 Sci. Phila., 1888, pp. 85-10.5). The following sentence is quoted therefrom as 

 bearing upon the above suggestion : " The stripes and spots on the limbs and the 

 dapple-marks on the trunk, as well as some ot the broader sheets of color, appear 

 to be related to the intervals between the muscle-masses or to the extent of skin 

 surfaces which correspond to muscles." p. 100.

the central depression. Dr. McCook added that, a^ far as he knew, 

 no araneologist had suggested the theory of muscular attachment 

 and action as effecting color distribution, and he did not wish his 

 opinion for the present to be considered as fixed ; but he thought 

 the theory probable, at least. 



II. On the Relation of Environment and Habit to Color Changes,, 

 it was observed : 



1 Spiders that live upon plants as a rule have colors that are 

 harmonious with the prevailing greens and yellows, and admixtures 

 thereof, of branches, leaves and flowers. 



2 Spiders that nest in stables, houses, on fences etc., ordinarily 

 have dusky colors, harmonious with the environment. Examples, 

 Theridion vulgare, Agalena ncevia, Tegenaria meclicinalis {Durhami} 

 etc. However, the speaker did not find that any great difference in 

 color is observable in the above species when they are found nesting 

 in foliage, as is often the case, at least with Agalena and Theridion. 

 It might be said, perhaps, that there is a slight tendency to darker 

 and a more uniform color when the spiders are found in the first 

 named locations. 



3 Ground spiders (the Lycosids etc.) generally have colors of 

 neutral grays that blend well either with the soil, with rocks or with 

 stalks of grass etc., especially when the latter are somewhat dry.* 

 Lycosids found in the neighborhood of streams do not seem to be es- 

 pecially influenced by the natural color of water ; but Dolomedes 

 sexpundatus, which is so constantly found on the water, frequently 

 has a tint like that of the stream itself. 



4 Saltigrades follow the rule of the Lycosids as to color. Their 

 colors harmonize well with the surface of rocks, trunks of trees etc., 

 upon which they habitually seek their prey. They are also suffi- 

 ciently harmonized with the color of leaves and the ground. 



The metallic green on the fangs of some Saltigrades seems almost 

 like a green leaf-ambush to the body of the creature as it is observed 

 stalking its prey. This suggests the strategy most familiar from its 

 association with the lines of Shakespeare : 



" Macbeth shall never vanquished be, until 

 Great Birnamwood to the Dunsinane hill 

 Shall come against hirh." 

 Of course this suggestion is fanciful ; but of what use to the crea- 

 ture can such a provision be if it sei'ves not as an aid in securing 

 its prey or protecting it against enemies? One might almost be jus- 

 tified for asking: can there possibly be anything in the above idea? 



5 Are the brightest colored spiders, which one would suppose 

 naturally to be most exposed to enemies like birds, and raiding ich- 

 neumon-flies and mud-dauber wasps, commonly protected by their 

 industry ? Dr. McCook cited a few examples as bearing upon this 



* It is a fact that the darker colors of most spiders are found contemporaneously 

 with the autumn changes of the foliage to a duskier hue, but the two facts are 

 probably due to the same cause, viz., the advancement of decay and the changes 

 •which result from this last named stage of vitality.

inquiry. Arglope rlparia and fasciata have protective wings of reti- 

 telarian lines thrown out on each side of their nets, which protect 

 the exterior of their bodies; and a thick shield-like sheeting which 

 protects the underside of the body. These spiders are highly colored 

 and cons2:)icuous by size ; they dwell in shrubs, bushes, grasses, low 

 trees, and commonly are stationed in the centre of their round webs, 

 having no domicile or tent to which they retire. 



The very bright colored spiders Epeira insularis and trifoUum, do 

 not hang habitually in the centre of their webs, but live in leafy 

 tents and their habitat is among shrubs and trees. Insularis inclines 

 to groves etc., much more strongly than trifolium. Epeira thaddeus 

 has the same habit. 



Per contra, Eperia strix, which is not a bright colored spider, by 

 any means, is one of the most secretive orb-weavers in its habits, 

 dwelling in a domicile of rolled leaves, shrinking away into cavities 

 and holes, under bark etc., and only occupying its snare during the 

 night. 



Epeira domiciliorum and cinerea {Harriwnce) are also spiders of 

 rather inconspicuous colors, and both of them screen themselves in 

 tents, though domiciliorimi, at least, not so habitually as insxdaris and 

 trij'olium. 



Epeira labyrinthea and triaranea are among the most strongly 

 protected by industry, having besides their orb and thick reti- 

 telarian snare, a dome-shaped silken tent as a domicile, and lab- 

 ryinthea in addition a dry leaf as shelter above her body or tent. 

 These spiders are strongly marked as to their patterns but do not 

 have the bright hues which characterize Argiope, Epeira insidaris 

 and others. 



3{eta hortorum is one of the most brilliantly colored of our indig- 

 inous spiders. Although its colors harmonize, particularly its green 

 and metallic silver, with its leafy surroundings, it rests beneath its 

 horizontal orb, and has straggling, pyramidal, retitelarian lines be- 

 neath it. It dwells mostly in w^ooded places, at least in this neigh- 

 borhood. Epeira gihberosa is also a bright colored spider. It dwells 

 beneath a sort of hanmiock or stretcher of lines woven between the 

 edges of a leaf. It is thus very well protected. 



Our three indiginous species of Acrosoma, rugosa, spinea and 

 mitrata are all, particularly the first two, w^ell marked spiders. They 

 are protected, mitrata least conspicuously, by spinous processes, (if 

 such can be called protections). They live in the centre of their 

 orbs as a rule, and their webs are most frequently found stretched 

 between the trunks of young trees, in openings of groves, woods, and 

 like spots. 



Gasteracanlha, with its strongly developed spines has very much 

 the same habit as our indiginous Acrosoma, but the spines appear to 

 be wanting in the young of this genus, the very age, one would 

 think, at which they are most needed. However, the young of 

 Oasteracantha, at least with numerous specimens sent from the Pa- 




176 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



cific coast, are almost black in color, a feature which may certainly 

 be regarded as protective if bright colors best invite the observation 

 of enemies. 



On the whole, the conclusion seems justified that many spiders 

 that appear to be more exposed to enemies by reason of bright colors 

 or greater size, have developed, or at least possess, special variations 

 in industry and habits that in some degree are protective. But 

 there are a number of apparent exceptions which require more care- 

 ful study before any general deduction can be warranted.

On an Insect-Larva Hibitation. — A communication was read from 

 Miss Adele M. Fielde stating that during June of last year there 

 were found near her house at Swatow, China, two specimens of an 

 insect larva-habitation, of a sort that she had not seen there before, 

 during a residence of a dozen years. The one was attached to an 

 exotic oak-leaved geranium, the other was crawling upon a path 

 under a Pinus sinensis. The first, some days later, gave issue to a 

 small brown moth. She opened the second and found the occupant 

 to be three-fourths of an inch in length, and black, with white specks 

 on the head and thorax. It had three pairs of short legs, ten ab- 

 dominal segments, and biting mouth-parts. Its house was builded 

 from small dry stalks of plants, cut evenly and laid side by side in 

 a spiral of expanding whorls, the larger coils overlapping the smaller 

 at the lower edge, sliowiug: the lower ends of the straws. The colors 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 177 



varied from pale greeu to dark brown, and were laid in such a way 

 as to indicate that one straw had been used up before another was 

 sought for the building. There were a hundred and twenty pieces 

 in the structure, the lower small end being open as well as the upper. 

 The house was lined with a brown silk cocoon, upon which the straws 

 •were very tightly and evenly cemented. 



Hoping to see the method in which the creature worked, she re- 

 moved from the upper portion of the truncate inverted cone, half a 

 whorl of its straw's, put the larva back, closed its house, put it under 

 a wire screen, on a plate of tender rose leaves, and stuck through the 

 screen several dry, small stalks of grass. The active and shy larva 

 would never emerge from its domicile when she was looking at it, 

 but she managed to surprise it at its work so many times as to make 

 sure of its method. The holes made in the rose leaves indicated that 

 they furnished food for the worker. The dry straw was drawn into 

 such a position that its end could be laid upon the house, and 

 cemented, with silken lining, into its place at the upper, enlarging 

 end of the spiral layei's. When laid and flistened, the lower end 

 being exactly in line with previously laid stalks, the upper end was 

 made by biting off the straw in the line of the upper edge of the 

 structure. Thirteen new straws were thus laid on to replace what 

 she had violently removed, and, after two weeks of active life under 

 the wire screen, the larva closed the upper aperture (its front door 

 and place of egress) by fastening it with a veil of silk, to the top of 

 the screen, from which it hung suspended. She did not perceive that 

 it had ever voluntarily departed from its house, though its head and 

 thorax often projected beyond its front door. By the small lower 

 aperture refuse was cast out. This specimen died without having 

 reached its metamorphosis.

ON THE GENERIC NAME OF THE TUNNY. 

 BY DAYID STARR JORDAN. 



In the first edition of the Regne Animal, 1817, pp. 313, 314, the 

 generic names, Thynnus and Orcynus, were proposed for the Tun- 

 nies. The former name was given to the short-finned tunnies, type 

 Scomber thynnus L., and the latter to the species with long, ribbon- 

 :shaped pectorals, type Scomber germo lunc^Scomber alatunga (al- 

 ulonga) Gmelin. 



It has been generally agreed that these two groups are generically 

 identical. Many European writers have continued to use the name 

 Thynnus for both, although this name was much earlier preempted, 

 Ijy Fabricius, for a genus of Insects. 



The name Orcynus is however also preoccupied having been pro- 

 posed by Rafinesque in 1815, in his worthless "Analyse de la Nature," 

 :as a substitute for Scombroides Lacep^de. 



According to current rules of nomenclature, the group of Tunnies 

 is left without a tenable generic name. I therefore propose the name 

 Albaeora, for the group of which Scomber thynnus is the type, this 

 species being with others, widely known as Albacore. The subgenus 

 •or genus distinguished by the elongate pectorals may be called Germo, 

 its types being Sc. alalonga Gmelin.

ON THE FORMATION OF ROCK-SALT BEDS AND MOTHER- 

 LIQUOR SALTS. 



BY DR. CARL OCHSENIUS. 



As is well known that ocean-water, from which all primitive rock- 

 salt masses have been formed, contains on the average 85 % fixed i. 

 e. saline constituents, of which 2 J % is sodium chloride, the remain- 

 der consisting of magnesium compounds, calcium sulphate, potassium 

 chloride, sodium bromide and small quantities of boron, iodine and 

 lithium salts, as well as traces of every other element, of which indeed 

 there exists one or the other compound, soluble in water and much 

 more so in salt-water. 



The open sea precipitates no salt, but in bays partially cut off 

 from it, a de^^osition can take place under certain circumstances, in 

 such a way that gypsum forms the base, and anhydrite the upper- 

 most layer of the salt deposit ; this is plainly seen in every large 

 rock-salt bed. In considering the mode of formation of such deposits 

 we are met on all sides by three questions, which hitherto have re- 

 mained somewhat inexplicable: — 1st the absence of fossils in the 

 salt, whilst the neighbouring rocks often contain them well preserved 

 and in abundance, 2nd the small quantities of easily soluble mag- 

 nesium and potassium salts, though they Avere contained in the sea- 

 water, and 3rd the replacement of these latter by one of the most 

 insoluble constituents, viz. sulphate of lime in the form of a cap of" 

 anhydrite, the so-called Anhydritlmt. These facts can, however, be 

 explained, if we take a hydrographical element, viz. the bar, into 

 account in the process of formation. When a nearly horizontally 

 running bar cuts off a bay from the sea, so that only as much sea- 

 water runs in over it as is compensated by evaporation from the 

 surface of the lagoon, and the so partially separated portion receives 

 no large additions of fresh — , i. e. rain or running water a deposition 

 of salt takes place in the Avay to be described. 



In such a bay the following phenomena may be observed : — The 

 sea-water running in evaporates, and by the amount of salt it adds, 

 the solid constituents of the bay are continually increased. The 

 upper sheets of water, warmed by the sun, sink as they get specific- 

 ally heavier from the larger amount of salt, and in the course of time, 

 a vertical circulation setting in, the whole aqueous contents become 




182 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



enriched in saline matter and rise in temperature.^ The greater 

 part of the deliquescent magnesium salts however remains in the 

 upper layers, while chloride of sodium is found preponderating below. 

 As the saltness increases, organisms possessing free locomotive 

 power, are compelled to seek a new habitat and make their escape 

 into the open sea against the currents and waves sweeping over the 

 bar ; those without free movement die off and generally leave only 

 indistinct remains in the strata, which are next deposited. The 

 formation of the latter commences with the precipitation of oxide of 

 iron and carbonate of lime, as soon as the concentration has pro- 

 ceeded so far as to double the amount of saline matter in the lagoon 

 and then ceases until the solution contains five times as much salts, 

 when a second layer of carbonate of lime settles, this being brought 

 about by a double decomposition between the soda and gypsum held 

 in solution in producing calcium carbonate and sodium sulphate. 

 At the same time gypsum begins to deposit and constitutes the basis 

 proper. As soon as the saline solution has increased its weight of 

 salts eleven times, its specific gravity reaches 1*22 and the precipita- 

 tion of chloride of sodium begins in the form of the well know foliated 

 crystalline masses, accompanied by some calcium sulphate etc., added 

 from the sea-water running in. 



Though generally speaking the sediments follow in reverse order 

 of their solubilities, as Usiglio - has shown in his exhaustive experi- 

 ments, it often happens that small quantities of easily soluble salts 

 are mechanically included in the others; thus magnesium sulphate 

 is frequently found contaminating rock-salt, and especially there, 

 ■where clayey mud washed in, and was deposited at the same time. 

 Then again some substances, only scantily represented in sea-water, 

 remain longer in solution than we should be led to expect from labo- 



^ By this interchange of heat downwards the constant temperature of 14C°. to a 

 depth of 4000 meters in the Mediterranean can be accounted for, the high barrier 

 at the Straits of Gibraltar cutting this sea off from the Atlantic ; westwards of the 

 entrance to the Mediterranean on the other hand, we find extending to the same 

 depth, an icy temperature of 0° to 40°. Accordingly deep sea currents rich in 

 chloride of sodium flow from the Mediterranean into the Atlantic as well as the 

 Black Sea, and are compensated by return surface currents. As a result of this 

 circulation, the surface water of the Mediterranean is rich in magnesium salts, 

 whilst the Black Sea, analogous to the Baltic, does not contain ocean water diluted 

 with fresh-water as one might at first be led to expect from the great influx of river- 

 water, but shows a preponderating amount of sodium chloride.

ratory experiments. This is especially the case with borates, magne- 

 sium borate in particular, as well as with silica and titanic acid. As 

 the depositing process continues, the greater part of the deliquescent 

 salts remains dissolved in the upper layers and constitutes the mother- 

 liquors {Mutterlaugen), which contain, along with sodium chloride, 

 the potassium and magnesium compounds etc. We have then in the 

 mother-liquors above the rock-salt, approximately arranged in order 

 of solubility : sulphateof magnesium, chloride of potassium, chloride 

 of magnesium, borates, bromides, lithium salts, an iodine compound 

 probably magnesium iodide, and calcium chloride. In the course 

 of the continued growth of the rock-salt beds and likewise of the 

 mother-liquors, the latter attain the level of the bar and commence 

 flowing out seawards directly over it, as soon as their specific gravity 

 can overcome the current of the inflowing sea-water. After this 

 stage is reached, ordinary sea-water can only have access through 

 the upper portion of the bar-mouth, the lower part being occupied 

 by the outgoing mother-liquors. 



At this point the last stage of the process begins viz., the deposition 

 of the uppermost bed of sulphate of calcium in the form of the 

 AnhydritJmt. Portions of the concentrated mother-liquors get mixed 

 with surface-water washed in, and this, from the increased amount 

 of the hygroscopic chlorides of magnesium and calcium, lessens the 

 superficial evaporation of the bay, and hence the influx of sea water 

 diminishes gradually. The sulphate of lime in the sea-water that 

 has flown in, is now precipitated, the other salts mixing w'ith the 

 mother-liquors and flowing out with them over the bar. As the 

 gypsum falls through the concentrated mother-liquors, its water of 

 combination gets abstracted, and a seam of anhydrite is by degrees 

 deposited. Sometimes a compound is formed of gypsum with the 

 sulphates of magnesium and potassium (the latter by double decom- 

 position of sulphate of magnesium and chloride of potassium) viz. 

 polyhalite, a mineral occurring in the upper strata of many salt 

 deposits. The bay meanwhile assumes the character of a bitter-lake 

 and influences the surrounding shores, the organisms inhabiting the 

 littoral waters dying off", and the neighboring rock disintegrating to 

 dust, which is blown into the lake, forming the material for the 

 salt-clay ; this offers a good explanation for the increased thickness 

 of salt-clay seams often observed in the upper layers of salt deposits, 

 *A regular succession of these briefly described phenomena will 

 rarely be found in nature. Every alteration in height of the bar, 




184 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



resulting from storms and other disturbances, naturally affects the 

 precipitations about to take place, by accelerating or retarding them, 

 or even redissolving some of the layers already in situ. In some 

 cases where the Anhydrithut was never formed, the bar not having- 

 retained its original height long enough, the salt-clay plays the 

 part of protecting covering ; however, even under these circumstances 

 the resulting series of deposits are so characterised as to point clearly 

 to their mode of origin. 



Salt beds deposited from aqueous solutions under the above-named 

 conditions, are found in all geological epochs as far back as the 

 Archaean rocks ; this is shown by the super-position of Silurian strata 

 to the salt in Salt Range in India. The existence of primitive salt 

 beds points conclusively to the presence of shores, i. e., terra firma, 

 at the time of formation. At the present day the first of the above 

 stated agents is found in operation in several localities on the East 

 coast of the Caspian, especially in the great bay of Adschi Darja, 

 whose narrow mouth, Karaboghaz (" black abyss "), is partially cut 

 off from the Caspian by a bar. The bay is one of the saltiest of this 

 inland sea, and receives no supplies of water at all from the land, 

 only its evaporation being balanced by a corresponding influx of 

 sea-water. Under these circumstances no animal can live in the 

 Adschi Darja waters, and the bottom is covered with a layer of salt 

 of unknown thickness ; in a specimen of this deposit dredged up by 

 Abich, the latter found gypsum intermixed with rock-salt. C. 

 Schmidt* in 1876, found no trace of potassium in the salt bed of 

 Karaboghaz. On the other hand the water contained in 100 parts : — 



8"33 sodium chloride 



1"00 potassium chloride 

 12"94 magnesium chloride 

 "02 magnesium bromide 



6"19 magnesium sulphate, etc., 

 in all 28'50 per cent, of salts ; this composition is nearly identical 

 with that found by Usiglio in mother-liquors, when they give off no 

 more water at the ordinary temperature. Similar conditions have* 

 been noticed at Tjuk-Karagan, Mertw}'-Kultuk and Karassee, Kras- 

 norvodosk, etc. The Caspian then gives up its chloride of sodium 

 to the salt-pans on its east coast and in return receives only mother- 

 liquors, accounting for the character of the Avater in the principal ba- 

 sin, which contains less salt than the ocean, but much more magiie- 



* J. Roth, Chem. Geol. I, 467.

sium compounds, and hence causes a degeneration in the marine 

 fauna and flora on the East coast. The Oxus (Amu Darja), which 

 two centuries ago poured its waters into Adschi Darja prevented a 

 deposition of salt there, but since sand-storms have diverted this 

 stream into the Aral, the change of the Caspian into a bitter-lake 

 has been accelerated by the formation of sand-bars along the East- 

 coast bays, which are converted into salt-pans. 



The above description of the processes now being carried out on 

 the East coast of the Caspian will suffice to illustrate the origin of all 

 rock-salt deposits, from the Silurian down to the 2:)resent era, and 

 further, the occurrence in each of gypsum, as basis and the Anhydrite- 

 cap with salt-clay as cover. Fossils are hardly ever present, and 

 mother-liquor salts rarely in large amounts. 



To go back to the time when the first signs of the anhydrite-cap 

 make their appearance, we find that an increase in altitude of the 

 bar, sufficient to cut off the influx of sea-water, causes the mother- 

 liquors to stagnate and under favorable conditions of temperature to 

 solidify. Such a process has taken place in the Egeln-Stassfurt ba- 

 sin, and in some other localities of the old North-German Permian 

 salt-sea. The potassium and magnesium salts, together with boron 

 and bromine compounds, have crystallized out and been exception- 

 ally well protected against re-solution by a clay seam impermeable 

 to water. There are to be seen lying on a rock-salt bed many hun- 

 dred yards thick, consecutive zones of caruallite, kieserite and poly- 

 halite ; the latter generally encloses the sulphate of lime, which was 

 still contained in the waters of the bay at the time of the closing in 

 by the bar, magnesium sulphate occurs especially in the second, and 

 in the zone of carnallite are found the chlorides of magnesium and 

 potassium, borates and magnesium calcium bromide (brom-car- 

 nallite). Calcium chloride is also met with in certain minerals, 

 such as tachhydrite etc., and in some cases undergoes in presence of 

 magnesium sulphate a double decomposition, calcium sulphate and 

 magnesium chloride being formed. 



The total quantity of chloride of magnesium occurring in the 

 Stassfurt beds does not correspond to the normal amount ; portions 

 of this substance must have made their exit over the bar with the 

 lithium and iodine salts, or have been absorbed by the upper beds 

 (N. B. lithium is found in the salt-clays above, but not iodine) or 

 were carried away in solution later on. Hence the succession of 

 mother-liquor salts in Stassfurt is not quite complete ; on the other 



13 




186 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



liaud the saltpetre fields of Taraj^aca and Atacama in Chile, now 

 resting on lower levels to those of the original salt-j^ans, afford an 

 example of an entire series of beds. In the reopening of the bar in 

 the Stassfurt basin, the process of salt deposition came again into 

 operation above the stratum of clay protecting the mother-liquor or 

 Abraum-saXts ; this is proved by the occurrence of an upper salt bed, 

 with anhydrite-cap etc. 



The lowest division of the whole series there, though the name 

 does not correspond very well, is known as the Anhydritregion, or 

 zone of anhydrite, on account of thin joarallel bands of sulphate of 

 lime transvei'sing it at regular intervals ; they are called annual rings 

 (Fahresringe), but cannot be explained by the direct influence of 

 the seasons, e. g. in winter, because they are not found in other salt 

 deposits, Avhich have been formed under similar climatic conditions. 

 It is more probable that a process, similar to that in the deposition 

 of the second lot of calcium carbonate of Usiglio, has taken place in 

 their formation. Some agent or other, related to that, which caused 

 the conversion of gypsum and soda into carbonate of lime and sul- 

 phate of soda, must also have been at work here. Most likely the de- 

 composition took place at first gradually, Avhereas towards the end 

 it was rapid, from which can be explained the " rings " being ramified 

 below and level above. Local peculiarities may also have been the 

 cause, for instance, periodic supplies of water coming from the land, 

 but it was certainly not of a purely climatic nature. This might 

 be a probable explanation for the exceptional case of Stassfurt de- 

 posits, where the mother-liquors were dried up above the salt beds 

 proper and not afterwards removed by external agencies. 



As the process of filling up of a salt-pan with gypsum, rock-salt, 

 anhydrite and salt-clay has proceeded so far that the anhydrite-cap 

 reaches the height of the bar, the latter deposit naturally retains 

 cavities and irregularities in its surface, occupied by fluid residues 

 of mother-liquors. These residues must often have been pretty consider- 

 able, and they represent a most important geological agency ; for 

 rock-salt formations can only occur on the sea-coast, and it is here 

 that volcanic action has its sway, so that we often find the neptunis- 

 tic and volcanic forces cooperating. Through displacement in the 

 beds, the residual mother-liquors are set free and flow to lower levels, 

 where on reaching an impervious stratum they collect and form a 

 salt-lake ; or if brought to the surface again a23pear as brine and 

 mineral springs more or less removed from the original source. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 187 



During their flow or collection the sulphates often separate from 

 the chlorides ; borates, once precipitated, remain so, and give rise to 

 sujjioni ; carbonic acid decomposes saline solutions more or less, but 

 chloride of sodium is scarcely ever entirely absent, and boron, iodine, 

 bromine and lithium are represented by traces. On account of this 

 remarkable action of carbonic acid on mother-liquor salts, the min- 

 erals accompanying trona thermonatrite etc., must be principally 

 sodium compounds, (chloride, sulphate, borate, silicate etc.) the car- 

 bonates of calcium and magnesium being separated out as fairly 

 insoluble precipitates. The carbonates of the alkalis decompose 

 silicates of lime in the rocks around forming carbonate of lime and 

 silicates of sodium and potassium as intermediate products, which 

 easily undergo decomposition, silica thereby being separated out in 

 the hydrated state : allowed to I'emain in contact with animal det- 

 ritus, saltpetre is produced ; magnesium chloride and sulphate con- 

 vert limestone into dolomite and certain silicates to serpentine ; the 

 sulphates of magnesium and lime also are often decomposed by cer- 

 tain organisms, giving rise to sulphuretted-hydrogen and a separation 

 of sulphur; lastly magnesium chloride dissolves all metallic com- 

 pounds, and even gold, hence mother-liquors with or without the 

 aid of water impregnated with carbonic acid, must have played a 

 great part in the deposition of most of our ores, by dissolving out the 

 metals contained in the different rocks around and concentrating 

 the same in cavities of various kinds. 



As the bituminous matter contained in brine-springs doubtless is 

 a product of decomposition of organic substances met by the mother- 

 liquors on their way, so the origin of petroleum, which is always 

 intimately connected with salt districts, can be accounted for by the 

 sudden destructive action of an overflow of mother-liquors over a 

 rich marine fauna and flora, the accompanying mud serving to shut 

 off" access of air from the cadaverous remains, and the presence of 

 some chloride of aluminum enabling the formation of all the repre- 

 sentatives of the hydrocarbon series from the small j^articles of 

 anthracite occurring in lodes, to the masses of volatile hydrocarbons 

 of the vast oil districts. In short, in most littoral districts of past 

 and present oceans, from the depths of our mines to the summits of 

 the mountains, which ocean-water has not reached, but where mother- 

 liquor residues have been transported, do we find tangible proofs of 

 the remarkable effects of which mother-liquors have been the primary 

 cause.

DESCRIPTION OF A NEW SPECIES OF OCINEBRA. 

 BY JOHN FORD. 

 Ocinebra Michaeli, Ford. 



Shell fusiform, rather slender, turreted, light gray, with a narrow 

 median brown band ; whorls 5, convex, shouldered above, the upper 

 ones carinate ; sculptured with numerous rather coarse revolving 

 lirations, the interstices with riblets bearing croAvded festooned 

 lamellse of growth, which are also prominent below the sutures ; 

 longitudinally prominently plicate, with about seven folds to each 

 whorl; aperture oval, white within, angular above; anterior canal 

 quite long, open, straight ; outer lip thickened within, bearing six 

 small tubercles; columella nearly straight; with a whitish callus 



projecting slightly at beginning of canal. Length of shell 16, diam. 

 8 mill. Length of aperture 9 mill. Hab., Cayucos, San Luis Obispo 

 Co., California. Differs from 0. interfossa Cpr., in having open canal. 

 0. suhangxdata Stearns, is somewhat related, but is much longer, 

 ess angulated, aperture more rounded and without the internal 

 tubercles shown by 0. Michaeli. So far as can be learned, this small, 

 but distinct species, has been found only by Mr. Geo. W. Michael, 

 Jr., after whom it is deservedly named ; the gentleman being not only 

 an efficient collector, but a careful student of science also. About 

 forty specimens have been secured alive by him at the locality 

 mentioned, which is the only one known at present.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE FEMALE GENERATIVE APPARATUS OF 

 HYiENA CROCUTA. 



BY HEXRY C. CHAPMAX, M. D. 



The Hyaena, as well known, was regarded by many of the ancients 

 as being a hermaphrodite. Thus Aelian^ observes " if you see a 

 male hyrena one year the next year you will see a female, if now 

 truly a female, afterwards a male, for it partakes of both sexes," 

 while according to Pliny- " the vulgar believe that the hyaena is of 

 both natures and are on alternate years male and female, and bring 

 forth without a male." The same opinion appears also to prevail 

 to a considerable extent even at the present day among the natives 

 and settlers in South Africa. Like many other popular opinions 

 and superstitions the view of the sexes being united in the same in- 

 dividual in the hytena is based to a certain extent upon fact, as in 

 one species at least, the Hycena crocuta, or spotted hyaena, the 

 male and female individuals resemble each other so closely that 

 naturalists as well as animal dealers and showmen find it impossible, 

 without dissection, to distinguish one sex from the other. Such 

 being the case it might naturally have been supposed that the at- 

 tention of anatomists would long since have been called to the con- 

 sideration of the generative apparatus in Hycena crocuta, especially 

 as in the other two species and Hycena striata, Hyana hrunnea, 

 the disposition of the generative apparatus is normal. It is only, 

 however, within recent years that it was show^n by Prof. Watson 

 of Manchester, England, that in the female of Hycena crocuta 

 the uterus passes directly without an intervening vagina into the 

 urethra to form a uro-genital canal which, perforating the clitoris, 

 offers a passage-wa}-, not only for the urine but also for the 

 foetus. Such a disposition would naturally suggest without dissec- 

 tion the idea of the animal being a hermaphrodite — especially as 

 not only are the vulva and vagina entirely absent, (Plates IX 

 and X), but there are present in addition to the large and well de- 

 veloped clitoris two projections below the anus simulating a condition

of the scrotum, obtaining in many of the carnivora. As my dis- 

 section of the female generative apparatus of Hycena erocuta that 

 recently died at the Philadelphia Zoological Garden agrees in 

 every respect' with that of Prof Watson, and as the description of 

 the parts given by that anatomist is excellent, my dwelling further 

 upon the same in detail apart from confirmation, would l)e super- 

 fluous. I will limit myself therefore, rather to the consideration 

 of how such an extraordinary disposition of generative appara- 

 tus might be brought about and to pointing out its significance in 

 the determination of the homologous parts of the male and female 

 generative organs of the mammalia generally. It is well known 

 that at an extremely early period of intra-uterine life, about six 

 weeks, for example, in the case of the human embryo, (Plate XI, 

 fig. 2.) the sex is undistinguishable, ovaries or testicles are undevel- 

 oped, the Mullerian and Wolfiian ducts, bladder and rectum ter- 

 minate in a connnon receptacle or cloaca, while no external gener- 

 ative organs are observable. As the development of the mammal 

 advances, however, the rectum and bladder separate and open by 

 distinct openings, the anus and urethra, the cloacal condition being 

 retained through life only in Ornithorynchus and Echidna, the 

 Wolffian ducts become the vasa deferentia, the Mullerian ducts 

 atrophying, supposing the individual to become a male or the 

 Wolffian ducts atrophying and the Mullerian ducts become trans- 

 formed into Fallopian tubes, uterus and vagina, supposing the indi- 

 vidual to become a female, the two bodies up to this moment, indif- 

 ferent functionally, becoming testicles or ovaries respectively — the 

 testicles usually in time descending into a scrotum, the urethra 

 passing through the penis. It is well known that in the female 

 of certain shrews, moles and lemurs and, as recently observed by the 

 author in the South American hare, Qtjiromys pilorides, (Plate XI, 

 fig. 1.) the urethra i)asses through the clitoris as through the penis 

 in the male of these animals. The fact of the clitoris being traversed 

 by the urethra in the of female Hycena erocuta is, therefore, not such 

 an uncommon condition as at first sight it might appear and confirms 

 the view held by morphologists of the clitoris being the homologue 

 of the penis. Indeed the clitoris only differs from the penis in being 

 smaller and in the fact that the labia minora do not unite under- 

 neath the urethra in the middle line to form what would correspond 



' It need hardly be mentioned that the contracted kidney and dilated ureter, 

 the latter due to impacted calculi, observable in my dissection, are pathological 

 conditions.

to the skin on the under surface of the penis. It has already been 

 mentioned that an early stage in the development of the mammalian 

 embryo the rectum, bladder, Mullerian ducts (the latter in the female 

 becoming the vagina and uterus) pass into the cloaca, and that as 

 development advances the rectum separates from the cloaca, open- 

 ing by the anus. With a still further advance in development the 

 uterus separates from the uro-genital canal and opens by a distinct 

 canal, the vagina, the bladder opening through the urethra. While 

 such is the normal order of develojament of the female generative 

 apparatus in the mammalia, it may be readily conceived that, should 

 the development be arrested at the stage in which the uterus and the 

 bladder still pass together into a uro-genital sinus and should the 

 latter traverse the clitoris in the same manner as the urethra does in 

 the case of C'apromys etc., a disposition precisely similar to that found 

 by Prof Watson and the author, in the female of Hycena crocuta 

 Avould result. If the above view be admitted, then the peculiar ar- 

 rangement of the female generative apparatus in Sycena crocuta 

 may be regarded as due to an arrest of development. One of the 

 most remarkable peculiarities of the female generative apparatus of 

 Hycena crocuta, to which we have hitherto only incidentally alluded, 

 is the entire absence of a vagina, the uterus passing directly into 

 the urogenital canal in which respect the animal differs from 

 all other mammalia, except perhaps the elephant. In the latter an- 

 imal in both the Indian and Afi'ican species, as observed by the 

 author^ a long and capacious urogenital canal leads into the bladder 

 on the one hand and on the other into a cavity which the author 

 regarded either as corresponding to a vagina or to the neck of 

 the uterus, this cavity leading in turn into the body of the uterus. 

 Should the latter view be accepted, that is if the cavity in question be 

 regarded morphologically as uterine, then the vagina would be ab- 

 sent in the elephant, as it is without doubt in the hysena. In con- 

 clusion it may be mentioned that the fact of the vagina being undoubt- 

 edly absent in Hycena crocuta and probably also in the elephant 

 settles definitely, at least for these animals, the question as to whether 

 the utriculus or sinus pocularis of the male should be regarded as 

 the homologue of the uterus or the vagina of the female, since if the 

 vagina be absent in the female hysena and elephant the utriculus of 

 the male of these animals must necessarily be homologous with the 

 uterus of the female.

Note on Mazapilite, a new species. — Prof. Geo. A. Koenig an- 

 nounced the occurrence of this mineral at Zacatecas, Mexico, in the 

 mineral district of Mazapil. The crystals are well developed in 

 all directions. They are of orthorhombic symmetry exhibiting a 

 flat prism in combination with a brachy dome and a pyramid. The 

 color is deep brown red, nearly black, but transparent at the edges. 

 The hardness is nearly 7, its streak greenish yellow. The specific 

 gravity 3'o67. In closed tube a white crystalline sublimate is pro- 

 duced (As ^ O ^) and water, while the powder turns dark brown. 

 B. B. fuses at 3 to a l>lack globule. On charcoal the odor of arsenic 

 is observed. With borax only iron reaction. Easily soluble in 

 in warm HCl. A preliminary analysis proves the mineral to l)e 

 a calcium ferric arsenite. The structural formula must be made the 

 subject of a more thorough investigation, which the speaker pro- 

 poses to carry out in the fall. This mineral is the first representa- 

 tive of the class of pure arsenites in nature and is therefore of mark- 

 ed interest. For the material the author is indebted to the indefat- 

 igable zeal of Dr. F. A. Foote, who is now in Mexico.

DESCRIPTIVE NOTES OF NEW AMERICAN SPECIES OF 

 ORB-WEAVING SPIDERS. 



BY HENRY C. MCCOOK, D. I). 



Epeira gemma, n. sp. 



1. (Fig. 1.) This is one of the largest orbweavers of the Pacific 

 coast, and is found from San Diego northward as far as Victoria. 

 British Columbia. The species varies a good deal in size and mark- 

 ings, but the largest iiclult female (a gravid specimen) measures 

 over 20 mm. in length. The abdomen 

 is 15'5 mm. long; the base of the abdo- 

 men is crowned with two large conical 

 processes. The markings upon the abdo- 

 men are as follows : The forepart which 

 rises quite abruptly from the cephalotho- 

 rax is of a blackish brown color, inter- 

 spersed at irregular periods with yellow 

 spots. Along the median line extends a 

 narrow band of yellow, upon which are 

 placed two angular or lance head mark- 

 ings, the first of which is placed about 

 the middle of the basal part, and the sec-

Epeira gemma, female, < i. oud uear the crcst. This band continues 

 more or less regularly along the dorsum to the apex. Aliout 

 the middle of the dorsum is a shield-shaped figure with scol- 

 loped edges, blackish brown in color for the most part, thouo-h in- 

 terrupted by yellow lines of a herring-bone pattern. A narrow 

 yellow border encompasses the shield. The color of the abdomen is 

 yellow, and this color extends to the posterior half of the abdom- 

 inal processes, the anterior half of the same being darkish brown. 

 Dark brown waving and interrupted lines extend along the sides, 

 and between these are small round spots, which are distributed 

 laterally along the sides with more or less regularity. A brownish 

 band extends along the ventral part of the abdomen from the spin- 

 nerets to the epigynum, bordered on either side by a yellowish band 

 and with two short parallel yellowish longitudinal lines drawn equi- 

 distant between these two. 



The epigynum is comparatively small, and between and slightly 

 bent over the dark lateral lobes is a short flat flap ; it is thickened

on the edges and viewed from the front, the tip is somewhat hooded. 

 (See fig. 2.) A broad central patch marks 

 the sternum, and the tongue and mandibles are 

 tii:)ped with yellow. 



The cephalothorax is about 5 mm. long ; is 

 rather small as compared with the immense ab- 

 domen, and is marked with two broad yellowish 

 bands extending along the sides and broadening 

 over the dorsum. The head is a brownish color. 

 The legs are marked strongly with annuli.

 web of the usual character of the group of Angulata, to which it 

 belongs, and rests in a nest of rolled leaves or dome shaped rubbish 

 placed on the upper side of its snare. The cocoon is a round flossy 

 ball of a darkish yellow color, about three-fourths of an inch in di- 

 ameter. A number of cocoons sent to me by ]Mrs. C. K. Smith from 

 San Diego, California, were found during the month of April to con- 

 tain well developed young spiders. These spiders are of a quite 

 uniform light yellow color, with a brown, well marked shield-shaped 

 figure upon the dorsum of the abdomen, which is without the conical 

 prominences that characterize the adult. Several of these cocoons 

 were hung in an arbor upon the 1st of May, and the spiderlings im- 

 mediately issued therefrom in great numbers, following the usual 

 habit of their kind to ascend for a considerable distance, and then 

 gather in small clumps or balls closely packed together. It is no- 

 ticable that the spiders from the various cocoons mingled together 

 without any hostility, climbed together the various bridge lines 

 which immediately issued from the spinnerets, and snugged together 

 in balled groups under the leaves, as though they all belonged to one 

 brood. The mouth being cold and very rainy, they remained thus 

 clustered throughout the entire month, and were not fully dispersed 

 until the first week in June.

Tliis spider I described in a verbal (communication to the Academy of 

 Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. The speci- 

 mens were found in nests of rolled leaves, 

 after the manner of Epeira insularis and 

 kindred spiders, and were attached by a taut 

 trapline to the centre of its adjoining snare. 

 Thespecimens then obtained were not mature 

 and on the appearance of Mr. Emerton's de- 

 scriptions of New England Epeiroids I con- 

 cluded that my species was identical with his 

 Epeira silvatica, which it greatly resembles in 

 external form. ' Subsequently, I received a 

 number of adult specimens from Professor 

 Peckham of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, collected 

 by him in that state, and thereafter, (1886) 

 P,^.. , I myself collected a number of the same 



Epeira bicentennaria, female, gpecies iu the Adirondack mouutains of 

 New York, in the neighborhood of the Saranac lakes and elsewhere. 

 A study of these led me to conclude that these ex- 

 amples differ from E. sihatica. The species is 15 mm. 

 in length ; is distinguished by two processes on either 

 side of the dorsum of the abdomen at the base. The 

 markings ai'e not unlike those of Epeira silvatica, 

 but the epigynum of the female, differs from that 

 organ as represented by Emerton.* This is shown 

 by a comparison of Fig. 4, with Fig. 5. This 

 appears to indicate a specific, or at least, a varietal 

 difference between .the two animals. According 

 to Emerton in adult females of silvatica "the under 

 side of the abdomen is dark brown without mark- 

 ings;" but the adults of bicentennaria have a 

 yellow lunette on each side of the venter below 

 the gills, and a yellow circular patch on each side 

 of the median line, both at the middle and at the 

 spinnerets. The abdomen is somewhat triangular 

 in shape. The breadth at the base is a little less than the length ; 

 the color is a yellowish gray with brownish markings. On the 

 basal part is a yellow mark, often assuming the shape of a lyre

or the letter "U." A shield-shaped figure with scollo])ed edges occu- 

 pies the middle of the dorsum. On each side is a broad, light un- 

 dulating band, with five or six folise of unequal length. See fig, 3. 

 The cephalothorax is 5 mm. long ; is smooth and marked by brown- 

 ish bands along the sides and middle. The legs are strongly annu- 

 lated with brown rings about the joints and also in the middle of 

 the thigh, tibia and metatarsus. Length : 1st pair, 22*5 mm. ; 2nd 

 pair, 2r75 mm. ; 3rd pair, 16 mm. ; 4th pair, 20"5 mm. 

 Epeira vertebrata, n. sp. 



3. A number of specimens of both sexes and various ages of this 

 spider have been received from Mrs. Rosa Smith Eigenmann, San 

 Diego, California, at which point the species seems to be abundant, 

 and indeed is distributed to some extent northward along the Pacific 

 coast. The specimens include two forms, which are very distinct 

 in their shades and coloring, one form being darker than the other, 

 so dark indeed, that some examples seem quite black. 



Female. (Fig. 6.) Length of body, ab- 

 domen, 11 mm.; cephalothorax 4"5 mm. 

 The abdomen is of a yellowish brown col- 

 or ; a V-shaped whitish figure opening pos- 

 teriorly, extends from the cephalothorax to 

 the crest of the abdomen. Tlie margins of 

 tliis figure are broad and irregular. A series 

 of irregular white spots extends across the 

 base and around the sides which are marked 

 by three rather regular rows of black spots. 

 The V-shaped figure is followed by a shorter 

 similar, figure, and this again by three circu- 

 lar patches of diminishing size, the whole 

 series terminating near the apex with a tri- 

 angular patch. The whole median line of 

 the abdomen from cephalothorax to abdo- 

 men is tlius marked by this series of distinct figures wdiich are 

 broken through the centre and along the line by a scolloped l>and 

 of yellowish brown color. At regular intervals on each side of 

 these vertebrse-like median markings, are circular and triangular 

 patches of a whitish yellow color. The outlines of the whitish 

 patches are marked by strong lines of rosy brown hue. The 

 abdomen is strongly reticulated and the whole appearance is

very beautiful. Underneath the abdomen, between the spinnerets 

 and the epigynum are three broken patches of whitish yellow color, 

 enclosing a dark brown band. 



The epigynum is marked by a hooked process or finger, hollowed 

 like a spoon at the tip. On the anterior side, the stem or base of the 

 finger rises from a white circular cushion that extends beyond the 

 body. The end of the process is black, slightly 

 tipped with yellow, and the base is yellowish 

 brown in color. (See Fig. 7.) The sternum is 

 shield-shaped, of a blackish brown color, with 

 a broad yellow lance-head figure in the middle. 

 Slight processes on either side of this band 

 mark the points at which the legs are inserted. 

 The cephalothorax is a yellowish brown color, 

 ^ marked bv bands of brown on either side, and

 summit of the caput. The head is a very little depressed and nar- 

 rows towards the face. The palps and legs are of the same color as 

 the cephalothorax ; the legs somewhat darker, and with dark brown 

 rings at the ends of the joints. Length, 1st pair, 23-5 mm.; 2nd 

 pair, 21"25 mm. ; ord pair, 14*5 mm. ; 4th pair, 23.5 mm. 

 Male : length of abdomen 7 mm. ; cephalothorax, 4-75 mm. 



The male differs very little in length, and in 

 the general character of the markings from the 

 female. The herring-bone or vertebrate figures 

 along the median line of the abdomen are com- 

 monly more closely united than iu the female. 

 The waving marks along the side are less bro- 

 ken and of a duller color. The general color 

 of the abdomen is gray, with the central mark- 

 ings of a whitish yellow. The abdomen and 

 legs are a yellowish brown color. The cephalo- 

 thorax is broad, the caput narrowing towards 

 the face : the central band of lighter color quite 

 broad. Length of legs, 1st pair 24'5 mm. ; 2nd 

 pair, 21'75 mm.; 3rd pair, 13"5 mm. ; 4th pair,

 is slightly curved, and is armed on the lower 

 and inside part with strong rows of thick black spines.

The dark variety of this species resembles in 

 the markings of the abdomen the lighter variety, 

 the abdomen, however, in the specimens pos- 

 sessed by me, appears to be of a more uniform 

 oval shape throughout. The colors of the ab- 

 domen are black, with yellow markings. On 

 either side are two broad broken bands of cir- 

 cular and irregular waving figures, which meet 

 in front and at the apex. The cephalothorax 

 and the legs are of a dark reddish brown or even

 also quite black, as are the tips of the palps.

4. I have three female specimens of this beautiful spider, one of 

 which I collected in Florida ; another was sent by Mr. C. A. Townsend, 

 from Swan Island, Caribbean Sea, and a third was sent to me by the 

 late Mr. William M. Gabb, from Santo Domingo. 



The spiders differ little in size, and measure in length 15 mm. 

 The abdomen is of a slightly triangular shape, in this respect approx- 

 imating Ejyeira domlciUorum. The abdomen is a bright yellow color, 

 somewdiat mottled upon the sides and around the ventre with a 

 darker shade of yellow or yellowish brown. The markings are a 

 quadruple series of lines drawn from the pits that indicate the mus- 

 cular attachments, longitudinally, to the apex. The spinnerets, legs, 

 sternum and cephalothorax are of a bright orange, except where the 

 abdomen overhangs the latter, which is yelloAV. 



The palps are a lighter shade inclined to yellow. The legs are 

 without distinct annuli, except the Florida specimen, which has a 

 broad black ring around the upper part of the thighs of the first, 

 second and fourth pairs of legs. The cephalothorax and abdomen 

 are covered with white hairs, and the leg armature is of the same 

 color, and rather weak and sparse. 



The epigynum consists of a short flap, tri-lobed at the tip, which 

 is slightlv separated from a thicker flap of similar shape, but which 

 consists apparently of three folds. VieAved from the side the epigy-

 hand clasped over the closed fingers ; the thumb representing the 

 posterior flap and the knuckles the folds and rugosities of the thick 

 anterior one. 



Epeira parvula. Var. conchlea. 



5. There are few spiders that present such striking variation in 

 markings upon the dorsum of the abdomen as Epeira jxtrvula. It 

 is a curious problem, which remains yet to be solved, what causes 

 this variety. It is probably due in some degree to those changes 

 which in certain species are evidently effected by the various moult- 

 iugs which spiders undergo. But that this cannot be the sole cause 

 is shown by the fact thnt the varied markings appear even among 

 mature specimens, particularly of the females. In a quite large 

 collection received from Wisconsin, through Prof. Peckham, and 

 from California through Mrs. Rosa Smith Eigenmann, I observed a 

 number of individuals upon whom a further and even more striking 

 change was manifest. 



The abdomen of Epeira parvula is triangular shaped upon the 

 dorsum, and the apical part, instead of rounding into an oval, ends 

 perpendicularly ; that is to say, is a straight wall from the spinnerets 

 to the top. In the variety alluded to, which I have named Epeira 

 conchlea, the terminal part of the dorsum of the abdomen assumes 

 the shape of a caudal process, resembling that which is characteristic 

 of the tailed spider, Cyclom caudata. (See Fig. 6, a.) 

 This peculiarity I have traced in about a dozen spe- 

 cies, and in some much more decidedly than in others. 

 In other respects the specimens appear to be nearly 

 identical with Epeira parvula. The epigynum is in 

 form the same, although larger, the finger being very broad at the 

 base, and rapidly terminating in a point that is slightly curled. In 

 1 front of the base is a tri-lobed black corneous flap. (Fig. 

 e^ 6, e.) 



The body length is about 7 mm. The maxillae are 

 Fig. 6, e. broadcr or as broad as long and subtriangular at the tip.

While visiting the British ]\Iuseum of Natural History at South 

 Kensington, London, in the summer of 1887, 1 was permitted to ex- 

 amine some fossil insects and fossil spiders therein contained, under 

 the kind direction of Dr. Henry Woodward, the Keeper of the 

 Geological Department. Among the aranead fossils I observed one 

 which appeared to me to be new to science, and closely related to 

 the genus Atypus. The fossil is a tolerably well preserved impres- 

 sion, taken from the Eocene Tertiary at Garnet Bay, Isle of Wight. 



After my return to America, Dr. Woodward sent me casts both 

 in wax and plaster, from which the appended description has been 

 made. These impressions somewhat shook the view which I was at 

 first inclined to take as to the systematic place of the specimen. 

 But on the whole, I am inclined to adhere, though with some qual- 

 ification, to my original judgment. 



The only hesitation that an araneologist would feel in placing the 

 species would be as to whether it belongs with the Saltigrades or 

 jumping spiders, among the Attidre perhaps, or with the Territelarise 

 among the Atypinse. Those who have examined fossils of insects and 

 other small arthropods, especially of the order Arane^e, will under- 

 stand the difficulty in determining with absolute accuracy their gen- 

 eric and specific rank, and will, therefore, not be surprised at this 

 hesitation concerning the above named specimen. 



The shape of the cephalothorax to some extent, especially as viewed 

 from the original fossil in the British Museum, and more particularly 

 the character of the falces as noted in a side view of the specimen 

 shown at Fig. 1, indicate that the fossil may belong to the fiimily 

 Atypinae and be closely related to Atyjnis. The name Eoatypus 

 Woodwardii is therefore suggested for the species. If this inference 

 is correct, we may possibly have in this new fossil the distant pro- 

 genitor of the present British species of Atypus, Atypus ])iceus.

 lines, showing slight marks of joints, and on one palp is a suggestion 

 of a terminal bulb Avhich might indicate it to be a young male. 



The caput and median part of the cephalothorax as viewed from 

 the cast, are well elevated and defined ; the cephalothorax narrows 

 towards the abdomen. But in the original imj^ression in the rock

and less distinctly on the casts, there appear outlines on either side 

 of the margin of the cephalothorax, as though by pressure those 

 parts had been flattened, and only the caput and a part of the dor- 

 sum of the cephalothoi-ax along the median line had withstood the 

 pressure and had been pushed upward into the matrix by the same. 

 These outlines are visible, but not as distinct in the plaster cast. 

 It is at this point that one experiences difiiculty in determining 

 whether the specimen is related to Attus or Atypus. If the broader 

 marginal markings are impressions of the original cephalothorax, 

 the inference would be that the spider represented by this fossil be- 

 longed to the Atypinae. That such is the case, I am strongly in- 

 clined to believe, both on the ground just named, and the charac- 

 teristics of the mandibles, as well as the general facies of the impres- 

 sion and cast. (See Fig. 1.*) In the absence of the characteristic 

 eyes and long, jointed superior spinners it would be impossible to 

 relegate the specimen to the genus Atypus with absolute authority.

Neither would one be warranted to characterize a new genus by the- 

 absence of eyes and spinners, since these organs were doubtless^ 

 present but have simply foiled to impress themselves upon the- 

 matrix. I have, therefore, felt compelled, on the one hand to pro- 

 pose a new generic place for this fossil, and on the other, to present 

 no sharply defined generic characteristics. Indeed, it must be 

 admitted that besides expressing the general facies of the fossil, aa 

 above described, the generic value of the name Eoatypus consists^ 

 largely in assigning the specimen rank as a fossil spider. 



On one side, portions of all the four legs are preserved, the first 

 three showing the articulations at the trochanter, femur and patella. 

 The second leg shows also the patella entire, indicating the articula- 

 tion with the metatarsus. On the other side a portion of the femur 

 of the first leg is shown with the patella and its articulations. Both, 

 hind legs are represented by the apical parts of the femora. 



The horizon from which this new fossil was obtained is that from 

 which most European fossil spiders have been taken, viz., the Eocene 

 Tertiary. It is also that from which have come our American ara- 

 nead fossils as recently studied by Mr. S. H. Scudder from specimens 

 collected at Florissant, Colorado.

 During a visit to Florida in April 1886, I had the pleasure of 

 observing in natural site for the first time the nests of Abbot's 

 Atypus, an aranead heretofore known as the black Atypus, or Atypus 

 niger of Hentz. I had possessed for a number of years specimens 

 of the long tubes in Avhich this creature dwells '^ concerning which I 

 only knew that they were reported as being spun along the outside 

 of the trunks of trees. 



I. GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION. 



The field of observation was on the plantation of Dr. William 

 Wittfeld,^ at the lower part of Merrit's Island, which is situated be- 

 tween the Indian and Banana Rivers, a few miles south of Cape 

 Canaveral. A large number of specimens were collected, some of 

 which are submitted for inspection. The species is distributed 

 widely thi'oughout the state of Florida, is found in Georgia, and 

 probably in the Southern Atlantic States. 



The female of this Atypus has not heretofore been described, al- 

 though it has recently come to light that it was known and figured 

 nearly a century ago by Mr. John Abbot, an Englishman settled 

 in Savannah, Georgia, during the latter part of the last century* 



^ The substance of this paper was given as a verbal communication before the 

 last meeting (18S7) of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, at 

 Manchester, England. 



^ I had Floridian examples of the nest from Professor Riley the Entomologist 

 of the Agriculture Bureau ; and also from Dr. George Marx of Washington.

Among Mr. Abbot's figures is cue of this Atypus which he quite 

 happily describes as "the purse web sj^ider", (a popular name which 

 I cordially adopt), and makes a brief and correct note of its habits. 

 "This singular species," he says, "makes a Aveb like a money purse 

 to the roots of large trees in the hammocks or swamps, five or six 

 inches out of the ground, fastened to the tree, and the other end in 

 the ground about the same depth or deeper. To the bottom of that 

 -part in the ground the spider retreats. I imagine they come out 

 and seek their food by night as I never observed one out of its web. 

 In November their young ones in vast numbers cover the abdomen 

 of the female and the abdomen then appears very much shrunk. 

 The male is the smallest, but has the longest nippers. Taken in 

 March and is not common." ^ 



The description of Hentz ^ was made from a single specimen, a 

 male, found in June on newly turned soil at North- 

 ampton, Mass. Mr. William Holden reports it as 

 collected in Ohio.^ The spider ought therefore to be 

 found in the Middle and Atlantic States of America, 

 but I have never been so fortunate as to see it therein, 

 and have never heard of any one who happened 

 Atypus upon it. It probably is not abundant, or its nesting 

 habits must be greatly modified by change of latitude ; 

 otherwise one would suppose that its very conspicuous nest would 

 not have escaped notice. Or, may we suppose that it is disappear- 

 ing, perhaps has disappeared before the progress of human civiliza- 

 tion ? 



II. DESCRIPTION OF THE NESTS. 



The Florida nests are silken tubes of various lengths and sizes, 

 ranging from ten inches long and three-fourths inch in diameter, to 

 minute silken pipes a few inches long, and about one-eighth inch in 

 ■diameter. Externally most of them present a dark, weather beaten 

 ai^pearance and are covered with more or less sand. Inside, the 

 silk is white and clean. The texture of the material of which the 

 nest is spun is quite close, resembling a rough-finished bit of silk 

 cloth.

These tubes are found attached to the trunks of trees, along which 

 they extend upwards for various distancesgaccording to their size ; 

 the size being evidently determined by the age of the occupant. 

 The young spiders have very small tubes. The adults occupy large 

 tubes. The nests are fastened to the bark of the trees at several 

 points by white tlu-eads. They are often open at the top, that is, 

 there is no designed closure like a lid or door ; but for the most part 



the top edge of the tube drops in 

 or folds over, making an accident- 

 i al closure. Beneath the surface of 



( ' the ground the tubes extend into 



f the sandy soil around the root 



\' of the tree for various distances, 



sometimes equalling the length

III. USE AND MANNER OF SPINNING THE TUBULAR NEST. 



Immense numbers of these nests were found throughout the woods 

 on the grounds of Dr. Wittfeld. Spiders when found within the 

 tubes were usually clinging to the inside, a short distance from the 

 top, or were found in the same position underneath the soil. The 



most persistent ob.servation 

 at various hours, night and 

 day, failed to uncover any 

 of the spider's habits as to 

 capture of prey, the mode 

 of building the tube, or the 

 uses of the tube in the life 

 economy of the creature. 

 I have no doubt, however, 

 that in the uses of its pecu- 

 liar web the Purse web spi- 

 der will be found to resem- 

 ble closely her British 

 congener, Atypus piceus. 

 According to ]\Ir. Fredrick 

 Enock,^ this aranead cap-

her tube by striking them through the silk from the inside, and 

 when they are thus secured cutting a vent in the tissue large enough 

 to drag the prey through into the tube. This is a most curious and 

 interesting habit, the existence of which was established with toler- 

 able certainty by Mr Enock by various observations and experi- 

 ments. I may venture to repeat the substance of one of these. 



A large blow fly was held by its wings and permitted to crawl 

 upon a bank until it walked upon one of the tubes of Atypus. The 

 spider ascended a little distance and returned. The head of the fly 

 was then rubbed against the tube a number of times, the tube mean- 

 while becoming imperceptably distended, indicating the spider's 

 approach. After a moment's pause the fangs were thrust through 

 the fly, folloAved by a crunching sound as the spider closed and 

 almo.'^t ci'ossed the top fangs around its prey. The observer released 

 his hold upon the fly, and immediately the left hand fang was with- 

 drawn just into the tube which was torn, and the fang refixed into 

 the fly. The right fang was then withdrawn and quickly seized the

fly through the opening, and after several tugs the insect was pulled 

 ■within the tube, and the spider backed downward holding its prey- 

 fast in its falces, leaving a rent a quarter inch long by three-sixteenth 

 inch wide. After an interval of three minutes the spider cautiously 

 reascended tlie tube to the opening, and taking hold of the ragged 

 €dges of the rent, drew them towards each other until they almost 

 touched. She then backed a little and turned her abdomen so that 

 the spinners approximated the united edges. Then by a number of 

 zigzag movements with the spinners across the juncture, she com- 

 pletely closed the rent, and when it was neatly repaired returned 

 apparent!)' to feed upon her prey. The next morning the rent was 

 covered with sand so carefully that Mr. Enock could scarcely detect 

 where it had been. When the spider was satisfied with food, it 

 Avould draw in the tube in a determined manner, and would retain 

 her hold in this position sometimes for several hours. 



1. A time-measure of the spinning-work. — Being foiled by the 

 persistent secretiveness of this spider in natural sites, I captured sev- 

 ■eral specimens and placed them within glass jars in order to observe 

 their behavior under these artificial conditions. Some important 

 facts resulted, particularly as to the mode of constructing the tubu- 

 lar nests. The bottom of each jar was filled with sand, and a stick 



inserted within, in order to give a 

 natural position for the establish- 

 ment of a nest if the spider should 

 be inclined to weave one. One indi- 

 vidual, after long continued explo- 

 ration of its quarters, at last estab- 

 lished itself at the foot of the stand- 

 ing stick and began to burrow a 

 little hole. I was compelled to 

 leave at this point, and did not re- 

 turn to my room until evening, after 

 twelve hours absence. During this 

 time a vertical tube of white silk 

 one and one-fourth inch long and 

 about the thickness of the spider 

 had been spun along the side of the 

 stick. The outside of the tube was 

 sparsely covered over with j^articles 

 of sand which of course had been

quired to construct a tube was also obtained. The inch and a

quarter tubing was built within twelve hours, although of course it 

 cannot be determined how much of this time was actually consumed 

 in spinning work, probably not more than two hours. It is at least 

 evident that a length of two inches or more a day is quite within the 

 spinning capacity of Atypus. 



2. The Foundation Frame and mode of Spinning the Exterior 

 Tube. — Another specimen gave a very satisfactory clew to the entire 

 mode of constructing a tube. It first took its position at the foot 

 of the stick in the centre of the jar and wove a small lateral tube 

 extending partly around the base. (See fig. 7.) At 9 o'clock in 

 the evening this tube was pierced at the top, and the creature began 



to erect a vertical tul^e along the sur- 

 face of the stick. The mode of pro- 

 ceeding Mas substantially as follows: 

 Single threads were attached to the 

 stick about two inches above the sur- 

 face. These threads were stretched 

 downward and over a lateral space 

 about the width of the tube to be spun, 

 extending to the little opening which 

 had been made in the tube at the base 

 of the stick. The lines were repeated 

 and over laid until at last they ac- 

 quired considerable consistency of tex- 

 ture. At the top terminus they were 

 attached to the stick or to one another. 

 At the bottom the point of attachment 

 was a little distance from the surface 

 of the stick so that most of the lines 

 had a slanting position. Their appear- 

 ance might be compared to that of 

 a number of poles leaned against a tree. The structure thus gradu- 

 ally assumed a skeleton tubular form which was increased by the 

 pressure of the spider against the lines as it moved back and forward 

 within them upon the surface of the stick. When the scaffolding 

 was completely overspun the section appeared as a close silken tube. 

 3. 3fode of Spinning under ground. — A third specimen enabled 

 me to determine the manner in which this rough frame was com- 

 pleted so as to give it the close texture of the tubes found in Nature. 

 This specimen had excavated a tunnel against the inner surface of the- 



Fig. 6. Purseweb Spider. Foundation 

 lines of frame for a tube. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 209 



glass jar. Its niovenients were thus entirely open to observation. 

 .if Along this subterranean way or tun- 

 • '^ nel the spider strung fine threads cov- 



ering the bottom, the side and the top, 

 forming a frame quite resembling the 

 foundotion scaffolding used in spin- 

 ning the vertical tube. (See fig. 6). It 

 V then proceeded to thicken these lines

Fig. 7. Purseweb Spider's tube, gee- i"g thcreform. The animal's motion 

 tion after frame is overspua. reminded onc of a plasterer using his 



trowel to spread mortar rather than a weaver spinning cloth. The 

 space covered by these movements having been sufficiently thicken- 

 ed, the spider proceeded to another spot and went through the same 

 process. AVhen it came to thickening the upper portion of its tube it 

 turned its abdomen upward resting its body upon the dorsum of the 

 cephalothorax. In other words the creature laid upon its back. Its 

 abdomen was well turned over so that in this position the spider was 

 almost in the form of a semicircle. The pressure of the abdomen 

 upwards forced the lines at the point of impact into a little bay, the 

 concavity of which was thickened over with threads spun from the 

 spinnerets which were managed in the way already described. That 

 is, the spinnerets were moved back and forward, and the out spun 

 threads were beaten upwards into the lines already formed. 



This procedure very closely resembles the manner of spinning 

 which I have often observed in Mijgale Hentzii the large tarantula 

 of our southwestern States. This mode of thickening over the foun- 

 dation lines of the tube also closely resembles the behavior of orb- 

 weaving and other spiders when constructing the thick jjadding 

 "which surrounds their eggs, forming their eggsacs or cocoons. I 

 have seen it notably in the case of Lycosa. It is without doubt the 

 "way in which the trap-door spider of California {Cteniza Calif or nica,~) 




210 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



spins the silken lining of her well known and much admired trap- 

 door nest. 



4. The Nesting Tube Spun in Sedmis. — It was further determin- 

 ed with reasonable certainty that the spider builds its tube in sec- 

 tions. A letter from Miss Anna Wittfeld, after I returned from 

 Florida, informed me that the spiders had spun complete tubes with- 

 in the jars which I had left under her care. The question was at 

 once raised, were these tubes completed by adding to the section 

 Avhich liad already been observed? From correspondence with Miss 

 Wittfeld the information was obtained that the tubes had been 

 £nished as I had conjectured, by adding to the portions j^reviously 

 formed. We may, therefore conclude first, (1) that the mode of 

 <ionstructing these tubes is for the first time fully determined; sec- 

 ond, (2) that the original section, of greater or less length ■ as the 

 ■case may be, is spun in the manner now determined and described ; 

 and third, (3) that additional sections, of probably about the same 

 length, are added thereto according to the fancy or necessity of the 

 builder, and constructed in the same manner as the preceeding one. 

 It is thus within the power of Atypus to lengthen out her tube and 

 extend along the trunk to any desirable height, the web surface 

 available as a snare for taking food. Thus, also, as she ascends along 

 her arboreal hunting ground she carries with her the protecting 

 "walls of her tubular home, which is truly her castle. 



A large number of tubes was collected, and these I cut open with 

 the view of determining whether any trace of this mode of spinning 

 by sections had been left in the form of seams or joints ; but nothing 

 of the sort was found. The jioints of juncture Avere so skilfully 

 covered over that they differed in no respect from the texture of 

 other portions of the tube. The silk on the inside, however, was of 

 beautiful smooth white color, decidedly in contrast with the appear- 

 ance of the outside. In many specimens examined the upper ex- 

 tremity of the tube was made of perfectly white silk which apparent- 

 ly had been quite recently spun, showing an addition to the tube 

 eithel* for the purpose of repairing and strengthening, or else of ex- 

 tending the old nest. This observation upon the nests spun in nat- 

 ural site quite harmonizes with the conclusion reached from the ac- 

 tion of Atyjius in confinement.^

 viii., p. 241, 1876. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 211 



5. Doors. — An examination of the numerous nests shows that 

 openings are usually but not always left at the top of the tube. 

 These openings are placed indifferently beneath, at the side and 

 above. "When the spider is not near the upper portion of its tube, 

 the silk naturally collapses, and the opening is not apparent. How- 

 ever, it must be remembered that a very slight stroke of the mandi- 

 bles would open the tube at any part and give the spider egress. 

 So also a feAv movements of the spinnerets would close the aperture. 

 Moreover, if we accept the conclusion that the mode of capturing 

 prey is the same as that o? Atypus piceut (as above described) there 

 appears to be no special need for a door for the main necessity of 

 life, since the spider has little or no occasion ever to go outside her 

 own tower or cave. 



IV. SANDING THE OUTSIDE OF THE TUBE. 



It has been stated that one of the individuals put imder observa- 

 tion, after having spun her snare, covered it more or less thickly 

 "with grains of sand. It was thus indicated that the sanded condi- 

 tion of the tubes found in natural positions is the result of purpose 

 on the part of the builder. What purpose does it serve? Many 

 spiders of various fiimilies are in the habit of protecting their cocoons 

 or eggsacs by covering them with mud, with particles of soil, with 

 bits of decayed wood and bark scraped or broken off, with various 

 minute chippage, and even with the debris of insects' wings, heads, 

 legs etc., cai^tured for food. In this behavior the purpose is obvi- 

 ously to protect the enclosed eggs from hurtful weather changes and 

 various enemies, cheifly the parasitizing ichneumon-fly, Pezomachus. 



The use of the sand deliberately placed upon the outside of the 

 nest of Atypus is not so obvious, although it perhaps serves to 

 toughen it, and possibly protects its inmate from the assaults of 

 certain enemies as yet unknown. In natural site the sand and 

 weathering give the tubes almost the exact appearance of the out- 

 side of the tree along wdiich it is placed. In a large pi'oportion 

 of my specimens the sand w^as intermingled with brown w^ood-dust 

 from decayed bark and the dark colored vegetable mold which was 

 heaped around the base of the trunk, and into which the spiders 

 had excavated. 



It has been conjectured that this is an example of so called mimi- 

 cry. Some observations made by Mr. Frederick Euock on the 

 habits of Atypus piceus, the British congener of our Florida spe- 

 cies, raise a doubt upon this supposition, at least indicate another 




212 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



solution. The mode of constructing the tuhe as observed by Mr. 

 £nock is substantially that which I have above described as prac- 

 ticed by our Purseweb Atypus. After the completion of her tube 

 Piceus was seen to take a load of sand between its falces, every grain 

 of which it deftly guided with its fangs, literally pushing the grains 

 through the side of the tube. Having exhausted its supply it 

 reversed its position, returned to the bottom, and repeated the action 

 of gathering and distributing the sand. At the end of an hour and 

 a half it had completely covered the silken tube with sand, every 

 grain of which it had brought up from the surface of the ground, 

 thrust it through the silken tube from the inside, and afterwards, as 

 the occasion required, smoothed over the rent with newly extruded 

 silk. The next morning a small quantity of sand had been forced 

 out at the top of the tube, showing that the industrious creature had 

 continued its labor during the night; and this, indeed, was pro- 

 longed during the greater part of the day. The following night it 

 had lengthened the aerial portion of the tube and covered it with 

 sand.^ We may perhaps, conclude from these facts that the spider 

 had apparently simply endeavored to save itself the labor of carry- 

 ing sand to the top of its tube, by pushing it through the rent sides, 

 a method which would be naturally suggested by its custom of 

 opening the tube to take in its prey. 



Mr. Moggridge attributed this sanding of the exterior to a pro- 

 tective purpose, and alludes to the fact that while tubes of Atypus 

 piceus found on sandy banks were covered with sand, a nest taken 

 at Troyes, France, in a mossy site, had moss and plant fibres woven 

 upon it.^ But as the spider in such environment would be compelled 

 to clear away particles of moss, root fibres etc., in extending the 

 nest over the surface and through the close standing stems, there 

 appears to be no reason why it might not treat this chippage pre- 

 cisely as it did the sand in Mr. Enock's examples. No doubt these 

 spiders, as well as our Purseweb, while in the act of deporting the 

 sand excavated from beneath, frequently leave grains attached to 

 the inside of the tube. Indeed, it would be difficult to prevent this, 

 as .the sand readily entangles with the silken fibres; but as such a 

 rough coating would be unpleasant to the creature in its frequent 

 passing to and fro, it would overspin all these inside droppings. 

 Indeed, in this \evy fact we may see a sufficient reason for the

habit of getting the sand out at a point nearer the ground than the 

 top of the tube. On the contrary the particles dumped from the 

 top or through slits in the side, and which also readily entangle 

 within the silk strands as they fall, are permitted to remain inas- 

 much as they are not inconvenient. The idea of a protective pur- 

 pose cannot, however, be wholly excluded ; for it is found that in 

 repairing the rents made in the tube in order to draw in the strick- 

 en prey, the new material spun over the rent is quite invariably 

 sanded. This indicates a deliberate intention. 



On the whole, in view of the above facts, and reasoning from 

 them by analogy it appears that (1) much of the sand and bark- 

 dust which covers the outside of the nests of Atypus is an incidental 

 result of the act of excavation; (2) that, however, the spider does 

 at times deliberately add to this coating; (o) that the jjurpose of 

 this act is probably protective at least in the way of strengthening 

 the tube ; (4) that there is no positive proof that protective mimic- 

 ry has any part in the habit ; yet (5) as a matter of fact this exterior 

 coating does better adapt the tube as a snare both to decoy insects 

 to a light and enable them to travel upon it. 



V. MATERNITY HABITS. 



JNIuch remains to be determined of the life-history of the Purseweb 

 spider, but we may venture the prediction that in many points it 

 will be found to differ little from the habits of its British congener 

 as described by various observers. We know from Abbot's note 

 above cited that the young, like the offspring of Lycosids, domicile 

 upon the back of the mother after they are hatched. The cocoon 

 containing the eggs is of course retained within the purseweb, and 

 probably in that portion which is beneath the surface of the ground. 

 Atypus piceus suspends her egg-cocoon in a pretty hammock of silk 

 an inch long, attached to the top and bottom of the pouch.^ The 

 number of eggs within the cocoon of Piceus is from one hundred to 

 one hundred and fifty. They are deposited in midsummer, July or 

 early August, and the young issue from the cocoon about the latter 

 part of September. They remain with their mother in the maternal 

 nest during the winter, and Mr. Enoch found the female and her 

 young together March 31st, and again as late as April 5th. About

 habit in Mr. Simon's paper, Annals Entomological Society of France, 5th Series,

the last named dates the younglings make their exode, and after be- 

 ing dispersed in the n)anner usual to spiderlings, j^roceed to make 

 tiny tubes which are miniatures of the parent nest. As the develop- 

 ment of spider life in Great Britain is later than in the United 

 States the tubelets of the young of Abbot's Atypus may be looked 

 for in the early autumn. Some of the Florida specimens which I 

 collected in April within their tubes, I judge to be members of the 

 preceding autumn broods. 



VI. ORIGIN AND RELATIONS OF THE TUBEWEAVING HABIT. 



The tube-making faculty appears to be, as far as secondary causes 

 are concerned, the natural result of the instinct of self-protection. 

 It is perhaps most natural that the lower animals should seek to 

 protect themselves within barriers formed by their body secretions, 

 as is the case among the larva; of many insects. The restless move- 

 ments of the body characteristic of these creatures, conjoined with 

 the instinct to cover themselves up, to protect themselves from un- 

 favorable weather changes and from the approach of enemies, may 

 be a sufficient natural explanation of the origin of the tube-making 

 habit. Thus the silk moth larva while secreting silk from the 

 glands which open on the under lip, moves backward and forward 

 continually distriliuting its secretions, and at the same time by the 

 motion of its body limits them to the borders of the space around 

 which it moves. In the same way the social caterpillars have 

 learned to shut themselves within their well known tent, which 

 presents so largely the appearance of a designed structui'e, but which, 

 in its origin, at least, may have been quite as much the result of 

 accident, the silken secretion simply hardening around the limits of 

 the space through which the restless creatures move, and which by 

 their motions they keep free from threads. In like manner the 

 larva of the ant, at the moment when Nature brings upon it the 

 sense of the great change from its larval to its pupal estate, moves 

 backward and forward within a narrow space secreting its delicate 

 silk, which by its movements is pushed from direct contact with its 

 body, and hardens into the little case or pouch in which itself at 

 last is encompassed. Thus, in an entirely natural way, we may 

 suppose that the Great Over-Force while planning and directing, 

 preserving and governing all creatures and all their actions, has 

 developed the interesting habit of spinning tubes or cylinders as a 

 protection to the body. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 215 



Among tlie spider fauna this habit is particularly prominent. It 

 does not exist as with insects in a larval estate, but in the perfect 

 animal, the only one, with possibly one exception,' of which we have 

 knowledge, the tube-making instinct of insects being confined to the 

 larval period. This habit, which characterizes the larvre of insect* 

 is carried forward to the perfect animal among the Aranete. The 

 habit of protecting themselves by tubular spinning work in one 

 form or another exists among some species of every section or tribe 

 of the spiders. 



Among the Orbweavers we have such examples as Epeira strix,. 

 which spins a tough silken cylinder, open at one end. Within thi& 

 she makes her home, and holds a connection with her round snare 

 by means of a thread. This tube is spun wdthin cavities of various 

 sorts, and often within a curled leaf. The habit is again illustrated 

 among the Orbweavers by the beautiful silken domes or tents with 

 or without a leafy covering, such as are formed by the Insular spi- 

 der, Epeira insularis or the Shamrock spider, Epeira trifolium. 



Among the Retitelarias or Lineweavers we have such examples 

 as the pretty tubular tent of Theridium zelotyppinn which I have 

 found swinging among pine leaves in the Adirondack forests contain- 

 ing the mother and young. The Saltigrades or Vaulting spiders 

 spin thick silken tubes within which they shelter themselves during- 

 summer and winter, and in Avhich also they bestow their egg-sacs. 

 The Laterigrades I have found sheltered underneath a little tubular 

 tent, guarding their cocoons, although the tube making habit seems 

 to be least decided among these of all the aranead families. The 

 Tubeweavers, of course, as their name implies, have a strong ten- 

 dency, in this direction. Indeed, some remarkable examples of 

 tubular nests may be found among them, as in the case of our 

 Medicinal spider {Tegenaria medicinalis), and the funnel-shaped 

 snare of the Speckled tubeweaver {Agalena noivia), which is onje of 

 the most common spiders of America. 



The nest of this Agalena is a tube, oftentimes of considerable 

 length, which broadens out from the top-opening into a sheeted 

 snare that is spread over surrounding surfaces, and is usually guyed 

 or supported by lines reaching upward. It may be seen extending^ 

 within little cavities and openings, insect burrows, gopher holes and 

 the like, and in some cases I have thought that I have seen indica- 



^ Psocus. See my "Note on a Web-spinning Neuropterous Insect, Psocus 

 sexpunctatus." Proceed. Acad. Nat. Sci. of Philadelphia 1883, pp. 278-9. 




216 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



tions that the occupant had assisted in accommodating her spinning 

 work to her usurped quarters by widening and deepening the hole. 

 At all events, the snare when seen in such sites presents a very 

 striking appearance of having been a work of design, both in the 

 burrow and in the inter-spun tube, precisely as in the case of the 

 Tunnelweavers. Agalena has one remarkable physical character- 

 istic in common with Atypus and other Theraphosids, namely, the 

 long jointed spinnerets which are used so actively in spinning her 

 characteristic tube. 



When we come to the two remaining tribes, the Lycosids and 

 Tunnelweavers, (Territelarise) we see this habit possessing special 

 ■developments, and here also we see it associated with the burrowing 

 habit which is such a marked characteristic of many of the higher 

 animals and even of man himself 



The nest of Cyrtcmchenius elongatus as described by M. Eugene 

 Simon closely resembles that oi Agalena ncevia in the character of the 

 tube alone ; but this tube is enclosed within a deep cylindrical bur- 

 row, and is prolonged upward for about three inches above the sur- 

 face of the ground, and enlarged into a funnel-shape, so that it be- 

 comes from two to three inches across at the orifice. This aerial 

 portion is snow white, and at once attracts the eye even from a con- 

 siderable distance ; the nests, rising up amid sparse grass which 

 serves to support but not conceal them, present the appearance of 

 scattered white fungi. Cyrtauchenius belongs to the Territelarise, 

 and appears to be nearly related to Atypus and Nemes'ia. Mr. 

 Moggridge classifies its nest among those of the trap-door spiders, 

 characterizing it as the funnel-shaped nest.^ 



The nest of Cyrtauchenius even more closely resembles that of 

 certain Lycosids found in the United States ; for example, Lycosa 

 tigrina' is quite abundant in the Atlantic States of America. It con- 

 structs a nest which answers closely to Simon's description of Cry- 

 tauchenius, the only exception being that the portion of the nest 

 above ground quite invariably forms an oblique angle with the tun- 

 nel within the ground, and the burrow is not lined with spinning 

 work below the mouth. The aerial portion of this spider's nest is 

 sometimes formed into a beautiful vestibule above the mouth of the 

 burrow, and as the winter season advances is occasionally shielded

 ridge gives a diagramatic figure of this Spider's nest from the description of M. 

 Simon. See pi. 13, p. 183.

with a sort of swinging door. Hentz says that one winter he found 

 a burrow of a Lyeosa (species not named) supplied with a lid, and 

 he thinks it probable that all Lycosids close the orifice of their holes 

 for hibernation.^ I may say here that probably all burrowing Ly- 

 cosids close the openings of their nests as the cold season approaches, 

 and it is possible that the same habit will be found to prevail as a 

 protection against heavy rains even in the summer and autumn. 

 Mrs. Mary Treat says that certain Lycosids thus shut themselves in 

 just before moulting, and remain so until quite recovered from the 

 after debility^ 



Another interesting Lycosid tubemaker is the turret spider.^ This 

 creature constructs above the surface of the ground to the height of 

 one or two inches a little tower which is in form an irregular penta- 

 gon, and is composed of bits of straw, stalks of grass etc. It is quite 

 like the old fashioned mud-chimneys which I have often seen at- 

 tached to the gables of log cabins in the far west.* Unlike the sur- 

 face nest of Tigrina, the tower of Arenicola is invariably built in the 

 line of the burrow, the whole forming a straight perpendicular tube. 

 We have thus established, through the nest of Cyrtauclieniiis, a very 

 <;lose connection between the nesting habits of the Lycosids and that 

 of the Territelarise. 



In the case of Atypus sulzeri, as it is seen in England and de- 

 scribed by its first observer, Mr. Joshua Brown, the nest assumes the 

 shape of a pendant inflated tube, covered with particles of sand, 

 closed at the top, extending nine inches more or less above the silk- 

 lined burrow of like depth, and attached to surrounding foliage. 

 In this form it cannot diflfer largely from that of our Purseweb 

 spider except that the former is stayed among the grass-stalks and 

 the latter is fastened to the tree trunks. It would be interesting and 

 perhaps highly suggestive were Abbot's Atypus to be domiciled in 

 a grassy site away from trees, to note its behavior. Would it make 

 a nest quite like that of the English Atypus ? ^

 5 Efforts to pursue my studies of the Purseweb spider were prevented by the loss 

 of the living specimens sent me by Miss Wittfeld from Florida. We exhausted 

 our ingenuity in providing protection for packages sent through the mail, but not 

 a spider lived. Evidently the species is more sensitive to such confinement than 

 many others. I regret to record that since writing this note, the young lady here men- 

 tioned has died. Her keen and intelligent interest in insect life are well known 

 and were highly appreciated not only by myself but by others entomologists.

The nests of the same spider ^ according to other observers havfr 

 the projecting part trailed along the ground or surface growth of" 

 grass or moss. Thus the tube differs from that of the Purseweb 

 Atypus simply in that it is spun horizontally along the surface in- 

 stead of being attached in a perpendicular position to a tree. M. 

 Eugene Simon says that Atypus piceus conceals herself in dry locali- 

 ties, partly underground ; sometimes in woods, principally the plan- 

 tations of evergreens. Its retreat is altogether hidden, sometimes 

 by the stones, at other times by the moss, so that it is necessary ta 

 search with care and over large spaces in order to discover it. This 

 Atypus burrows obliquely a deep tunnel of 15 to 20 centimetres of 

 the size of its body. It constructs part of its tube quite straight and 

 of a tissue very thick, of which the upper part is longer than that 

 within the subterranean gallery. It is continued horizontally upon 

 the soil and terminates in a tapering closed point. jS^ear its lower 

 extremity, the tube presents a large expansion where it dilates into 

 the form of a chamber quite spacious, within which the spider dwells^ 

 It is at the entrance of the contraction that it suspends by a few 

 threads the cocoon containing its eggs. Simon presents a drawing 

 in site of the nest of Atypus,^ and a good figure of a collected speci- 

 men is given by jNIoggridge.* 



These comparative results suggest a very interesting analogy be- 

 tween the spinning industry of the two aranead tribes, the Citi- 

 gradse and Territelarite, which I venture to present in diagrammatic 

 outlines at Fig. 8 and 9. The first figure in the cut (Fig. 8, 1) rep- 

 resents the simple burrow of the Mygalidse, which, in many species- 

 and especially our own American tarantula, is a tubular hole in the 

 ground without any silken tube or lining. This quite corresponds 

 with the unlined tubular burrow which is the typical nest of the 

 Citigrades as represented by most of the Lycosids (Fig. 9, 1.) 

 The second figure of the series (Fig. 8) shows the silken tubular 

 nest of the Atypinse, as represented by the American and European 

 species considered in this paper. Here we have the ground burrow

 above the surface and attached to trees (a) or to the adjacent herb- 

 age either in a straight tube (b) or a curved one (c).

Turning to the corresponding number in the Citigrade series 

 (Fig. 9, 2) we see the burrow slightly silk lined at the mouth, and 

 carried upward above the surface where it is supported by a rude 

 turret. The silken tube is, hoAvever, open and is rudimentary as 

 compared with that of Atypus. 



The third members of the two series show a yet closer likeness in 

 in the nest forms viz., that of Cyrtauchenius (Fig. 8, 3) and that of 

 Lycosa tigrina (Fig. 9, 3). The last named spider by that form of 

 surface nest described above (Fig. 9, 4), shows us a rude suggestion 

 of the trap-door spider's nest which, whether spun within a ground 

 burrow (Fig. 8, 4, a), or within the ridges of bark upon a tree (4, b) 

 as with certain Mexican species, has attracted the admiration not 

 only of naturalists but of all observers. It is curious to note, by the 

 way, the tendency of these accomplished nest builders to domicile 

 upon a tree like their American tribal associates, the Purseweb 

 spiders. 



^ Some of the large creatures known generally as the Mygalidae or tarantulas 

 I have no doubt silk line their burrows. We might therefore add to this series 

 another and intermediate form of nest between Mygale (1) and Atypus (2) as here 

 given. 




220 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



From this comparison these conclusions and inferences appear : 

 First, (1) Tunnehveavers and Citigrades have several well marked 

 common characteristics in their nesting industry that suggest a close 

 relation in spinning economy. Second, (2) the two tribes furnish 

 examples of nests that may be arranged in series of advanced indus- 

 trial skill, from a simple burrow to the highly specialized nest of 

 the Trap-door spider on one side and, on the other, to the rude door 

 or lid of Tigrina's silk-lined vestibule. Third (3), the most perfect 

 manifestation of nesting industry is found with the Tunnelweavers, 

 who are more dependent upon spinning-work for sustenance (and 

 probably protection) than the Citigrades. Fourth (4), there appears 

 to be some, although no very marked relation between the animal 

 organization and the quality of the spinning work of the two tribes. 

 The greatest development in size, as well as in spinning function, 

 has been reached among the Tunnelweavers ; but most araneologists 

 would consider the Lycosids the more highly organized spiders. 

 Moreover, the Tunnelweavers are provided with long, jointed supe- 

 rior spinners (lacking in Lycosids) specially adapted for weaving 

 their more perfect nests. 



Finally, as the result of a comparative study'of the nesting indus- 

 try of all the spider fauna, we may conclude that there is one 

 germinal or typical form of nest among all the tribes, which form is 

 the tube. Around this common and rudimentary form, which has 

 been shown to be the one most natural to all animals possessing the 

 spinning function, the greatly varied and widely divergent nests of 

 spiders, — whether known as domiciles, dens, tents, tunnels, or caves, 

 —may be grouped in series of more or less modified forms.

ON THE FAUNA OF THE LOWER COAL MEASURES 

 OF CENTRAL IOWA. 



BY CHARLES R. KEYES. 



The carboniferous rocks of the region in the immediate vicinity 

 of Des Moines have, until quite lately, yielded only fragmentary 

 remains of fossils. Recent investigations, hoAvever, have disclosed 

 a rich fauna embracing, as hereafter enumerated, more than 35 

 genera and nearly 60 species, the majority of them in a most perfect 

 state of preservation. In Iowa the lower coal measures present, 

 lithologically, a marked contrast with both the under-(subcarbonif- 

 erous) and the over-lying (middle and ujjper coal measures) strata 

 which are pre-eminently calcareous, while the lower coal measures 

 are characterized by an almost total absence of the calcareous 

 divisions, which are represented only by a few thin bauds of impure 

 limestone, local in distribution. A section of the rocks at Des 

 Moines presents : 



Drift 20 feet. 



Loss 15 " 



Middle coal measures 40 " 



Lower coal measures . . . . . 160 " 

 St. Louis limestone (not exposed in Polk county.) 

 The superficial deposits have been quite thoroughly studied by 

 McGee and Call,' but the palaeozoic rocks have in Polk county 

 received but a passing notice. Though economically of far greater 

 importance than any other formation in the state, the lower coal 

 measures have received comparatively little geologic attention ; and 

 the two attempts at an exhaustive and detailed survey of this 

 formation in Iowa, and a correlation of the different coal horizons 

 was unfortunately rendered abortive by circumstances entirely 

 beyond the control of those engaged in the study of the Des Moines 

 valley region. In Iowa the lower coal measures probably have a 

 maximum thickness of more than two hundred feet, but notwith- 

 standing the fact that at Des Moines the entire formation underlies 

 the city, which is situated just at the eastern border of the middle 

 coal measures, this maximum is nowhere, in Polk county, attained. 

 The base of the middle coal measures as characterized by Mr. St. 

 John'^ and as is clearly shown in several localities in the immediate 

 vicinity of Des Moiues, is composed of variegated clays and shales, 



1 Vide Am. Jour. Sci., vol. xxiv, Sept. 1882. 



2 White's Geol. Iowa, vol. I, p. 272. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 223 



"with one or two intercalated bands of impure nodular limestone. 

 These variegated shales have a thickness of forty or more feet, and 

 are easily recognizable at numerous exposures in the bluffs of the 

 vicinity by the thin limestone bands, which within the city limits 

 have yielded twenty or more species of fossils. Thei'e are also 

 included in the middle coal measures some local depositions of 

 micaceous sandstone, usually soft, and unfit even for the roughest 

 masonry ; some of it, however, is concretionary and quite durable. 

 Formerly these portions were quarried for local use, but of late no 

 attempt has been made for its utilization. At the southern extrem- 

 ity of Capital Hill this sandstone reaches a thickness of more than 

 twenty-five feet. A short distance north of the city a sandstone 

 having a thickness of twelve feet caps the blufi", and forms a high 

 mural escarpment along the south side of the Des Moines river. 

 Although the Des Moines and Racoon rivers have, in Polk county, 

 corraded their channels through the upper strata, the lower coal 

 measures are fully represented from the underlying St. Louis lime- 

 stone^ — the nearest exposure of wiiich is about thirty miles below 

 Des Moines — to the superimposing variegated shales just mentioned. 

 This formation as represented in this vicinity is composed almost 

 entirely of clays and shales, with a few thin layers of soft sandstone, 

 and at least three workable beds of coal. The relative positions of 

 the latter are shown in the following sections at the Giant Coal 

 Mine where the fossil forms hereafter mentioned were chiefly 

 ■collected : 



Drift clay and carbonaceous shales . . 56 feet

Coal No. 2, 4^ " 



Shales, lower lavers fossiliferous. ... 35 " 



Coal No. 3 . " 4i to 6 " 



To the southwest, from Capital Hill, the distance between coals 

 No. 2 and No. 3 appears to increase, and the latter vein attains a 

 thickness in some places of seven feet. The coal measures of Iowa 

 have a general dip to the south and west. To the northeast from 

 Des Moines, the coal veins appear to thin out and finally are want- 

 ing, as shown in the accompanying sections ; the fix'st at Altoona,

 Coals No. 2 and especially No. 3, are the most profitably worked 

 and furnish nearly all the coal miued in the county. Immediately 

 overlying, and thus forming the roof of, coal No. 3 is a soft black 

 clayey shale often slaty in places, highly fossiliferous and containing 

 much iron pyrites in the form of crystals and nodules ; many cubes 

 of the former being over an inch along the edges, and the latter often 

 containing shells of mollusca. The shell substance of the fossils 

 from these shales, aside from those contained in the pyritiferous nod- 

 ules, is replaced more or less completely by pyrite. In some speci- 

 mens the replacement is complete ; in others only a thin film of 

 pyrite covers the shell, leaving the interior of the shell substance 

 with the original calcareous constituents ; between the two extremes 

 all degrees of replacement by pyrite occur. In a few instances — 

 Lophophyllum, fish-teeth and the remains of crinoids — no replacement 

 has taken place. These fossiliferous shales are, upon exposure to the 

 weather, easily and speedily disintegrated into a fine black clay, 

 and the iron pyrite contained quickly decomposes; thus render- 

 ing it extremely difficult to obtain good specimens of fossils, unless 

 the shales are examined immediately upon being taken from the 

 mines. This fact may account, in part, for the apparent rarity of 

 fossils from the lower coal measures of Central Iowa, as all traces of 

 fossil remains are quickly obliterated after the shales have been 

 disturbed. 



Independent of its biological and geological relations, the fauna of 

 the lower coal measures of Des Moines is of considerable interest in 

 its bearing upon the geographical distribution during carboniferous

times of certain species ; and also on account of the close similarity 

 in many respects, of this and the fauna of the lower coal measures 

 of eastern Illinois, particularly that of the superimposing black 

 shales of the "Danville" coal, or coal "No. 7" of the general 

 Illinois section. Stratigraphically the relations of these two fossilif- 

 erous shales to the principal coal-beds are the same — each forming 

 the roof of the most extensive coal stratum in their respective 

 localities ; lithologically the two shales are apparently identical.

 belong to one of the coal measure species of this genus.

The only bryozoan remains from the black shales consist of a few 

 "well preserved specimens of this species. From the investigations of 

 Meek and Ethridge it would appear that Front's genus Setopora is 

 synonymous with Synocladia, and according to the former writer 

 K cestriensis from the Chester limestone is very closely allied to, if 

 not identical with, S. biserialis. This would give Synocladia biserialis 

 a much more extensive vertical range than has hitherto been sup- 

 posed.

The specimens from Des Moines are somewhat larger than the 

 one originally figured by Cox (Joe. cit.), and like that are broader 

 posteriorly to the mid-length than anteriorly. The posterior mar- 

 gin is broadly rounded instead of being obtusely angular as it is 

 often said to be, and as is shown in some figures of this species. 

 None of the specimens under consideration are, therefore, so promi- 

 nently subangular on the posterior margin, and broader anteriorly 

 to the mid-length as those shown in the figures of Meek and Worthen* 

 of a form which they call L. viytiloides Sowerby, while specimens of 

 Sowerby's species figured by Ethridge^ have the posterior margin 

 even more sharply rounded or obtusely angular. No opportunity 

 has been offered for directly comparing the American with the 

 European forms and consequently their exact specific relations have 

 not been sufficiently considered.

 This species was described from the lower coal measures of Jeffer- 

 son county, and inasmuch as the St. Louis limestone is exposed in 

 many of the creeks of that locality, its horizon is near the base of 

 the coal measures ; the horizon at Des Moines from which the spec- 

 imens under consideration were obtained is somewhat higher. 

 Though quite rare it will doubtless be found in other localities in 

 the Des ]\Ioines valley. It is associated with P. muricatus N. and 

 P. to which it presents differences that are both characteristic and 

 constant. The almost total absence of spines in this species forms a 

 marked contrast with the congeneric species of the same locality.

 A single specimen from the Polk County coal mine. This species 

 was originally described from South America; but with the exception 

 of Owen' and Marcou,' American paleontologists have until quite 

 recently adopted for this form Norwood's name of P. prattenianus. 

 A Productus collected from the Kinderhook in the vicinity of 

 Burlington, and from the same horizon in Max'shall county, unques- 

 tionably belongs to this species ; if, however, this is the form de- 

 scribed by White^ as P. loevicostv^, the latter is certainly synonymous

In the geology of Yorkshire, (p. 214, pi. viii, fig. 3) Phillips in 

 1836 described Producta muricata : but the description is very brief 

 and his figure Avould indicate that he had in hand a specimen of 

 less than average size of P. eostatus described by Sowerby nine 

 years before. In Iowa, Dr. White found Norwood and Pratten's 

 P. muricatus, most characteristic of the middle coal measures ; the 

 recent discoveries, however, show that it is the most abundant 

 brachiopod of the lower coal measures in the region around Des 

 Moines, yet the average size is somewhat less than that of the 

 same species from the calcai-eous strata of the middle coal measures 

 of the same locality. Both Davidson and Meek regard P. muricatus 

 N. and P. identical with P. longispinus of Sowerby. Throughout 

 Iowa at least, P. muricatus N. and P. presents characteristics that 

 are remarkably constant ; and when associated with P. longispinus 

 no hesitancy whatever would be entertained in separating the two 

 forms. The species of Prodiidus described have been numerous, as 

 is attested by an extensive and remarkable synonymy, which is only 

 too apparent to those who have given the subject careful attention. 

 The wide geographical distribution of some species, and the extensive 

 vertical range of others, together with the concomitant diflferences 

 of environment at the time when the species were living, readily 

 accounts for the extreme variations presented. Inattention to this 

 important factor has often led to the basis of species upon super- 

 ficial characters which are relatively unimportant as classificatory 

 criteria, and the confusion arising therefrom has rendered the study 

 of this group extremely unsatisfactory.

This species is one of the most abundant of the brachiopods 

 occurring in the bituminous shales of this locality. The average 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 229 



width of fifty specimens is nine millimeters, much below normal ; 

 specimens very much larger occur in other horizons. Here it is 

 generally perfectly preserved in all its details ; the mesial fold is 

 more sharply defined, and the depressions on each side of the fold 

 relatively deeper than is usual with this species. The depauperate 

 condition of this, and in fact of all the brachiopods from the same 

 horizon, is suggestive of an environment, at the time these animals 

 lived, that was extremely unfavorable to the full development, and 

 to the attainment of a normal size that would be rendei'ed possible 

 by a more congenial habitat. 



Chonetes laevis nov. sp. (Plate XII, figs. 3a, 3b.) 



Shell small ; much wider than long ; transversely semi-elliptical ; 

 the cardinal line as long as the greatest width of the shell, or often 

 slightly extended beyond the lateral margins. Ventral valve con- 

 vex, with no indication of a mesial sinus ; beak not prominent ; 

 cardinal area rather narroAV but well defined centrally, becoming 

 linear toward the extremities ; foramen moderately wide ; cardinal 

 margin bearing from four to seven oblique spines on each side of the 

 beak. Dorsal valve flat or very slightly concave ; with no mesial 

 fold. Surface of both valves ajDparently perfectly smooth ; but 

 under a magnifier it is seen to be marked by numerous fine concen- 

 tric strife, and more prominent, often somewhat imbricated, lines of 

 growth ; these are sometimes crossed by fine nearly obsolete radia- 

 ting strioe. 



Length 7 mm. ; breadth 12 mm. 



This species is found in the superimposing black shales of coal 

 No. 3 at Des Moines; and is associated with Chonetes mesoloba, 

 . Produdus muricatus, and the minute gasterpods hereafter mentioned. 

 The glabrate character, and the absence of a mesial fold and sinus, 

 as is constant in all eight of the specimens found, forms a marked 

 contrast with the associated congeneric forms, in which the radiating 

 strise are unusually sharp and well defined ; and also with the other 

 carboniferous forms of the same genus. This species is closely allied 

 to, and perhaps identical with, the form described by Geinitz^ as 



1 Carbonformation und Dyas in Nebraska, 1866, p. 60. 

 Chonetes glabra; but this name, however, was preoccupied by Hall 

 in 1857, for a species from the Upper Helderburg.

At the Pioneer mine several moderately larger specimens have 

 been obtained. This species has been more generally known as 

 Hemipronites a-assus M. and H. It is a common and characteris- 

 tic fossil of the coal measures throughout Iowa and the contiguous 

 states, and presents many varietal phases. Hall's Orthis rohusta 

 described from this state is unquestionably identical with this species. 

 There is also associated with the Dea Moines specimens a smaller 

 form, about five millimeters in width, which appears to difier very 

 materially from any forms of S. crenistria examined.

 the same year, Marcou's has priority as has been shown by White 

 (Vide under Betzia mormoni). McChesney in 1860 described this 

 form as Spirifer subventricosus, but in the revision of his first paper 

 he makes his species synonymous with Hall's S. opimus.

Not common; in fact, brachiopods are comparatively rare in the 

 lower coal measures of the region under consideration, and with two 

 exceptions the species are represented by few examples. In the 

 limestones of the middle coal measures this species is quite abundant, 

 and often attains a large size. As is well known it has a wide 

 geographical and vertical distribution, being found from the Appa- 

 lachian to the Rocky Mountain regions ; it also occurs in the sub- 

 carboniferous of Europe and India. In all probability several species 

 described from the subcarboniferous of this country will prove 

 synonymous with this form. In North America its vertical range 

 would then extend from the subcarboniferous through the coal 

 measures into the permian.

This species is represented by two specimens, one of which is 

 somewhat crushed. There appears to be satisfactory evidence that 

 Marcou's name has priority. Dr. White says in a foot note on p. 

 125, volume IV, of Explorations and Surveys west of the 100th 

 meridian : 



" Orthis pecosi, Betzia mormoni, Rhynchonella tita. E. rockymon- 

 tana, and Spirifer rocky montana were published by Marcou in his 

 Geology of North America. I have obtained satisfactory evidence 

 that the work was published as early as March 1, 1858. Vol. XV, 

 of the Bulletin de la Societe Geologique de France contains a 

 statement that a copy of the book was sent to that society on April 

 20, 1858. In the same year Shumard and Swallow published a 

 paper containing descriptions of the three first named species, under 

 other names, in the transactions of the St. Louis Academy of Sci- 

 ences, but that publication Avas not made until about the first of 

 June. In December of the same year, Hall published in the 

 Geological Report of Iowa, /Spm/era rockymonta7ia as S. opimus; and 

 in 1860, McChesney published II. rockymontana as R. etoniceformis. 

 It thus appeal's clear that Marcou is entitled to priority of all five 

 of the names given above, as stated in the. synonymy heading the 

 descriptions of those species in this report."

radiating strise, and between the two extremes every degree of 

 gradation occur associated, it is questionable whether the variety

Abundant at the Giant mine. The shell is of medium size ; sub- 

 globose ; dorsum broadly rounded. Umbilici closed. Aperture 

 transversely semilunate, but not expanding more rapidly than the 

 uniform increase in the size of the volutions ; inner lip but slightly 

 developed ; outer lip thickened and rounded towards the umbilici, 

 but becoming very attenuated towards the middle ; its medial sinus 

 rather broad, rounded and not very deep. Medial band obscure on 

 the costate portion of the shell, but on the terminal half of the body 

 whorl more or less distinct and in some specimens bordered on each 

 side by a low, narrow, yet well defined, ridge. Surface except the 

 last half of the outer whorl ornamented with from fifteen to thirty 

 or more sharp, simple, nearly parallel costse. Terminal half of body 

 Avhorl smooth, except along the medial portion which is often marked 

 by lines of growth, and sometimes by the low ridges, to which 

 reference has already been made. 



The form considered here under the name of Bellerophon urii is 

 the one usually designated by American palteontologists as B. car- 

 bonarius Cox. A careful comparison of the descriptions and figures 

 of the various writers on this group of Gasteropoda, and a large 

 series of specimens fails to furnish any valid reason for separating 

 specifically the American from the European form described by 

 Fleming in 1828 as Bellerophon urii. Norwood and Pratten referred 

 Cox's specimens to B. urii; but Cox in 1857 made it the type of a 

 species which he called B. carbonarius, distinguishing it from the 

 European form by the slight lateral expansion of the mouth and 

 particularly by the less number of revolving costae, which in B. 

 carbonarius were said to vary from nineteen to twenty-five, while 

 according to de Koninck B. urii had from thirty-six to thirty-eight. 

 Though de Koninck does make this latter statement in his earlier^ 

 work, his later Recherches* state that the number varies from twenty-

species and the European form the possession by the former of only 

 sixteen cost^e, or about half the number ascribed to B. urii by de 

 Koninck.

The specimens of this species collected do not present much varia- 

 tion. The two peripheral carinse are nearly equal and between them 

 is located the concave band of the sinus. The whorls are orna- 

 mented by sixteen or seventeen strong filiform lines — nine below the 

 lower carina, upon which there are two filiform lines ; three above 

 the upper carina upon Avhich there are two and sometimes three 

 lines ; and a single line on the sinal band. Crossing the revolving 

 lines are numerous prominent, equidistant transverse lines which 

 give to the whole ornamentation a peculiarly yet regularly cancella- 

 ted appearance ; between, and parallel to, these transverse raised strife 

 are also from three to six microscopic, yet sharp and distinct raised 

 stride. Meek and Worthen refer with a query to Shumard's species 

 a form from Macoupin county, Illinois, having about twenty-five 

 revolving lines (twelve of which occupy the lower side of the body- 

 whorl) instead of thirteen or fourteen as ascribed by Shumard to 

 this species. Shumard says : " surface of volutions ornamented with 

 from thirteen to fourteen rather strong filiform stride which are 

 crossed by sharp transverse strise ; " if by this he intends to convey 

 the idea that this is the entire number of lines including those on 

 the under side of the body whorl, Meek and Worthen remark that 

 they " should scarcely entertain a doubt in regard to our [their] 

 shell being a distinct species, since it uniformly has about double 

 that number of revolving striae on the last w-horl." In this and 

 some other groups of gasteropods much classificatory importance 

 appears to have been attached to the number of revolving costre ; 

 and sometimes a variation of three or four in the number has been 

 almost the only basis for specific distinction. After a critical exam- 

 ination of a large series of different species presenting these characters, 

 the question has arisen relative to the value of the number of costse 

 as a classificatory criterion. In some gasteropodous groups it has, 

 within certain limits of course, small value ; its exact importance 

 in Pleurotomaria and some allied genera has not as yet been satis- 




238 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF ' [1888. 



factorily made out, but it is certain, however, that in some groups at 

 least, it does not possess specifically such an important classificatory 

 value as has been generally supposed. 

 Fleurotomaria modesta nov. sp. (Plate XII, figs. 2a, 2b.) 



Shell small, sublenticular, spire greatly depressed, volutions six, 

 obliquely flattened above ; body whorl very large, rapidly increasing 

 in size, sharply angular on the periphery, flattened or very slightly 

 concave above, prominently rounded below, suture line linear ; 

 spiral band very narrow almost linear, very slightly impressed and 

 occupying a position just above the peripheral angle ; on the spire 

 the band is obscured by a single series of conspicuous nodes ; aper- 

 ture subquadrate, or subrhombic ; umbilical region slightly im- 

 pressed, but not perforated ; surface glabrate ; under a glass exhib- 

 iting fine lines of growth ; the last whorl with a series of small 

 transverse folds, or wrinkles, toward the tuberculated margin ; each 

 fold apparently originating at a node and extending about one-half 

 or two-thirds the distance to the periphery. 



Twenty or more specimens of this beautiful little species have 

 been obtained from the black superimposing shales of coal !N^o. 3. 

 It approaches more closely than to any other the form described by 

 Cox as P. depressa and may eventually prove identical with that 

 form. P. depressa, however, Avas preoccupied by Phillips in 1836; 

 and this name was also used by de Koninck and by Passy.

 Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., vol. Ill, p. 75. 



Pleurotomaria grayvillensis Geinitz, 1866. Carb. und Dyas in 

 Nebraska, p. 9. 



Shell rather small, conical subovate, longer than wide ; spire 

 moderately elevated ; whorls five to seven, obliquely flattened above. 

 Body whorl large, rapidly increasing in size, rounded below ; bian- 

 gular around the periphery, both angles being visible on the spire. 

 Aperture subrhombic ; outer margin sharp. Columella extended 

 below. Surface ornamented by from twenty-five to forty revolving 

 lines, of which twenty or more occupy the inferior surface of the 

 body whorl ; some of the lines are much more prominent than 

 others, and there is a more or less regular alternation of the more 

 prominent ones with less prominent raised strise ; these are 

 crossed by numerous somewhat regular lines of growth, giving a 

 more or less tuberculate appearance, which is most conspicuous 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 239 



toward the suture. The number of raised revolving lines appears to 

 vary Avith the size of the specimens, and the maximum given is for 

 the largest specimens collected. This species was originally de- 

 scribed from Pasey county, Indiana, and Grayville, Illinois. 



Pleurotomaria carbonaria Norwood and Pratten. 



Pleurotomaria carbonaria Norwood and Pratten, 1855. Jour. 



Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., (2), vol. Ill, p. 76. 

 This is by far the largest gasteropod yet discovered at Des Moines, 

 and the test, as compared with that of the associated species, is ex- 

 tremely thick and heavy. A closely allied species has been described 

 from the coal measures at Newport, Indiana, as P. netvportensis 

 White. According to Dr. White it differs fi'om P. carbonaria in 

 having " its revolving band ample and raised instead of concave, 

 with revolving lines within it, as in that sjDCcies ; and also in having 

 its aperture subcircular instead of semicircular." 

 Jttacroclieilus humilis, nov. sp. (Plate XII, fig. 1.) 



Shell very small, short, subfusiform, or elongate-subovate ; spire 

 prominent, forming one-third or more of the entire length of the 

 shell; volutions about six, increasing moderately in size, slightly 

 convex. Test rather thin. Columellar fold distinctly visible within 

 the aperture, Avhich is subelliptical ; callosity clearly defined but 

 not conspicuous ; outer lip thin, sharp. Suture well-defined but 

 not deeply impressed. Surface smooth, but under a glass exhibiting 

 lines of growth. Length 6 mm. ; width 3*5 mm. 



This little species is from the superimposing black shales of coal 

 No. 3, at the Giant mine ; and is found associated with the numerous 

 other small gasteropods mentioned hereafter. 



Macrocheilus gracilis Cox. 



Macrocheilus gracilis Cox, 1857. Geol. Sur. Kentucky, vol. Ill, 

 p. 570. 



The roof shale of coal No. 3, has furnished a good series of this 

 species, representing all stages of development up to those fifteen 

 millimetres in length. The smaller specimens are less ventricose 

 and have the spire proportionally higher than in the older ones, 

 which approach nearer the form described as M. ventricosus Hall, 

 and there is therefore reason to believe that the two species will 

 eventually prove identical. Cox states in his description that his 

 species Avas most likely a young shell. White' considers Soleniscus

 p. 259. 



Macrocheilus newberryi Hall, 1858. Geol. Iowa., vol. I, p. 719. 



The specimens collected at Des Moines present considerable 

 variation : some are typical M. neivherryi, from which others gradate 

 into forms more nearly approaching that described by Hall from 

 Alpine Dam as M. fusiformis ; hence their identity is not improbable. 

 This is also in corroboration with the suggestion of Dr. White in the 

 Indiana geological report for 1883 that " with full collections at 

 hand, it will be difficult to clearly define the specific characters 

 between M. neivberryi, M. planus and M. fusifoiim,is"

Specimens of this, and perhaps other species, often occur quite 

 abundantly. The specific characters of the described species of 

 this genus are so obscure that all attempts to separate many of the 

 so-called species prove futile. A careful comparison of the carbon- 

 iferous forms will doubtless lead to a considerable increase in the 

 synonymy of this group, and a reduction of the number of species to 

 four or five. 



Orthoceras (sp. und.) 



A single specimen from the Pioneer mine ; it is nearly 50 cm. in 

 length and has a diameter at the larger extremity of about 5 cm. 

 It is by far the largest specimen of this genus yet observed in the 

 carboniferous rocks of Iowa.

CRUSTACEA. 



Cythere nebracensis Geinitz. ? 



Cythere nebracensis Geinitz, 1866. Carb. und Dyas in Nebraska, 

 p. 2. 



It is with some doubt that the form from Des Moines is referred 

 to Geinitz's species ; it is much smaller than that which he described, 

 and also differs in other particulai's. A dozen or more good speci- 

 mens were collected at the Pioneer mine where they Avere associated 

 with Synocladia biserialit. This and a trilobite are the only crusta- 

 cean remains thus far discovered in the carboniferous strata at Des 

 Moines. The remains of articulates in the lower coal measures of 

 Iowa are exceedingly rare, and the only hitherto known specimens 

 of this group are more or less fragmentary remains of a single genus 

 of trilobites. Prior to this, ostracoid crustaceans have been collected 

 in Iowa in the upper and middle coal measures, and now is recorded 

 their presence in the strata of the lower coal measures of the state. 

 Pliillipsia (sp. ?) 



Of the trilobites only a single pygidium of a Phillipsia has been 

 collected, and this at the Pioneer mine. 



VERTEBRATA. 



Petrodus occidentalis Newberry and Worthen. 



Petrodus occidentalis Newberry and Worthen, 1866. Geol. 111. 

 vol. Ill, p. 70. 



From the Pioneer mine have been collected nearly all the remains 

 of fishes that have been found in the carboniferous strata of this re- 

 gion. It is with some little doubt that the dermal tubercles that are 

 here referred to this species really belong to it. The base is subquad- 

 rate in outline ; and the thin abruptly sharpened edge is broader 

 than in the one figured by Newberry and Worthen ; the ridges ex- 

 tending downward towards the obtuse angles of the base are much 

 more prominent than the others, which do not extend to the top of 

 the crown. There has also been collected at this mine the fin spines 

 of two species ; one about two centimeters, and the other four centi- 




244 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1888. 



meters in length ; the former is the more common and in a very 

 perfect state of preservation. 

 Diplodus sp. ? 



From the superimposing shales of coal No. 3 at the Giant mine. 

 The specific characters of the teeth collected have not been satisfac- 

 torily made out. They are evidently not far removed from D. 

 amjylicatus M. and Worthen, but the denticles are larger, more 

 slender and much longer than in that species. 



Synoptical Table of Genera and Species. 



Summing up the predominant faunal features as presented in the 

 accompanying synoptical table, it appears (1) that in those groups 

 having an optimum habitat marine there was not only a fewness of 

 species but also an extreme paucity of individuals ; (2) that brach- 

 iopods though well represented in both genera and species were in 

 fact not as proportionately abundant as might be expected when it 

 is remembered that this type of life had now nearly reached its 

 greatest expansion and culmination, and (3) that the fauna was 

 predominately molluscan — nearly two-thirds of the entii-e number 

 of species. 



The Ccelenterata, Bryozoa and Echinodermata form indeed a very 

 inconspicuous proportion of this local fauna, only three or four spe- 

 cifically distinguishable traces of each group being obtained. 

 Though the Brachiopoda are represented by fourteen species, in- 

 cluded in nine genera, they were with three exceptions of compara- 

 tively rare occurrence — Productus muricatus, Chonetes mesoloba and 

 Discina nitida only being abundant. The brachiopods are also all 

 depauperate, attesting conditions at the time that they lived ex- 

 tremely unfavorable to their full development and to the attainment 

 of a normal size that under more congenial circumstances would 

 have been rendered possible. Molluscan life, while the black shales 

 forming the roof of coal Xo. 8 were being laid down, flourished 

 luxuriantly, especially the gasteropods which in number of species 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 245 



composed more than one-third of the entire fauna. Not only did 

 they exceed in species but they far outnumbered all others in indi- 

 viduals, and while as a rule they Avere small and some of them even 

 minute their great numbers made up, in great part at least, for the 

 conspieuity of larger but few forms. Though the majority of the 

 forms of this group are small it is not a depauperation as among the 

 brachiopods, as is shown by the average size of the individuals of 

 each species being normal, and in some instances even considerably 

 above. Some of the species are also of interest because of their 

 recognition for the first time within the limits of the state, and thus 

 to a considerable extent their known geographical range is increased. 

 Others of the species enumerated are now known to have a wide 

 geographical distribution which is suggestive of a somewhat ex- 

 tended vertical range. Among recent mollusca and especially land 

 forms a wide geographical distribution, as has been remarked by 

 Binney, appears to be indicative of a high antiquity for the group. 

 The corroborative evidence is abundant : a notable instance is the 

 living Zonites, four or more species of which are circumpolar in their 

 distribution; and the genus — even a subgenus Conulus to which 

 one of these living forms belongs — ranges back to the carboniferous, 

 while the genus Pupa is represented in the carboniferous by four 

 species. Cephalopods are not abundant in the region under consid- 

 eration and are represented by only two genera and five species, yet 

 a Nautilus attained a diameter of twenty centimetres, and an Or- 

 thoceras was fifty centimetres in length with a diameter at the 

 larger extremity of five centimetres. Of the lamellibranchs the 

 majority are small, though two of them are comparatively large, 

 attaining a length of nearly ten centimetres, yet having an extremely 

 thin and fragile shell. One of the specimens collected is of especial 

 significance as exhibiting in all its details the internal features of 

 the shell — the characteristic well-defined muscular scars and the 

 edentulous hinge margin ; in fact, so closely does it resemble in 

 these characters, the general form and external appearance, a mod- 

 ern Anodonta that it is difficult to see how it can be generically 

 separated from it ; and should further investigation prove that the 

 specimens under consideration really belong to that genus, it would 

 be of unusual interest in its bearing upon the distribution of fresh- 

 water or non-marine mollusca during geologic times. The modern 

 TJnio and allied genera certainly have both a wide geographical and 

 geological distribution, as is shown by the rich discoveries of Union- 




246 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



id(B in the Mesozoic strata of the west : and the genus Anodonta is, 

 if the opinion of Hall is adhered to, represented in the Devonian by- 

 two species, but that these two forms really belong to Anodonta is 

 still questioned. Dawson has described several allied forms fi'om 

 the carboniferous of Kova Scotia; their family position is as yet 

 also unsettled. With these considerations in view, the evidence 

 thus far obtained points to a high antiquity for this group of bivalves 

 which now is so abundantly represented in all our streams and 

 ponds. As will be noted Crustaceans are represented by a species 

 of Cythere; and a trilobite of which a single pygidium only has 

 been discovered. Vertebrates are rare also, a few fish spines about 

 two centimetres in length, and several teeth, and dermal tubercles 

 are the only remains of this class found.

DESCRIPTIONS OF TWO NEW FOSSILS FROM 

 THE DEVONIAN OF IOWA. 



BY CHARLES R. KEYES. 



Conocardium altum nov. sp. (Plate XII, figs. 4a and 4b.) 



Shell of medium size, subtrigonal, anterior view broadly cordate. 

 Anterior end truncate, with a forward slope from the umbones to 

 the lower anterior sharply rounded extremity. Dorsal margin 

 behind the beaks slightly curved, with the edges of the valves 

 incurved, while in front of the beaks it is produced forward into a 

 more or less prominent alate extension ; basal margin crenate within ; 

 .posterior extremity at the hinge line decidedly angular. Beaks 

 rather prominent, gibbous, incurved. Hiatus lanceolate ; occupying 

 about two-thirds of the lower posterior margin. Surface marked by 

 .simple, regular, radiating costse, about forty in number, twenty-five 

 of which occupy that portion of the shell behind the umbonal slope ; 

 the umbonal slope is broad, bordered on each side by a prominent 

 costa.which gives it a decided biangular appearance ; the costte are 

 crossed by numerous fine, crowded concentric lines; and a few larger 

 somewhat imbricated lines of growth. 



Length 24 mm. ; breadth 21 mm. ; height 20 mm. 



Horizon and locality. Limestones of the Hamiltonian at Iowa 

 City, Iowa. 



This species somewhat resembles certain forms of C. trigonale of 

 Hall, but the very broad strongly biangular umbonal slope readily 

 distinguishes it from that species. It also apj^roaches some congen- 

 eric forms from the Devonian of Europe, especially certain species 

 from the western part of France, recently described by M. (Ehlert^ 

 Cyrtoceras opimum nov. sp. (Plate XII, fig. 5.) 



Shell rather large, strongly curved, gradually expanding toward 

 the outer chamber, but enlarging more rapidly transversely than in 

 the opposite direction ; transverse section broadly elliptical, slightly 

 flattened on the ventral side. Distance between the septa about one- 

 fifth or one-sixth the transverse diameter. 



Horizon and locality. Hamiltonian of Johnson county, Iowa, 



This is a large and robust species from the Iowa Devonian, hav- 

 ing a length along the dorsum of probably forty or forty-five 

 centimetres, and a transverse measurement of eighteen or twenty

248 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



centimetres ; dorso-ventral diameter of outer chamber nearly six 

 •centimetres. It has been found at various exposures of Hamiltonian 

 limestone in Johnson and the contiguous counties. It appears to 

 be closely related to certain species from the Niagarian of the west- 

 ern states.

THE PALATAL EUG^ IN MAN. 

 BY HARRISON ALLEN, M. D. 



The structures of the body which are the most constant and 

 those which are the most variable have alike an interest to the 

 biologist and to the physician. When constant they present char- 

 acters which may be employed in classification, and when variable 

 they are accepted as delicate tests for the activity of the nuti-itive 

 and developmental processes. I propose in the connections last 

 named to study the folds or rugse of the hard palate as they are 

 seen in the human subject after the period of infancy, especially in 

 subjects who have reported to me for the treatment of chronic 

 nasal catarrh. A group of minor structures is here met with which 

 can be presented in a systematic manner notwithstanding the wide 

 range of variation they exhibit. 



What variations from the type met with in the lower animals are 

 seen in man? How do these variations in turn associate themselves 

 with morbid states? With what structures do these variations 

 correlate ? What forces are at work to produce in man results so 

 different from those seen in the animals related to him? 



I will attempt to answer these questions. I will also give among 

 related appearances those which may have a clinical significance. 



In the main it may be said that the rugae of the lower animals 

 form a constant series. But instances of irregularity can be given. 

 They are much broken up in the posterior part of the palate of the 

 hog. A slight asymmetry often exists in the horse ; and instead of 

 being in opposite, may be in alternate series. For a full discussion 

 of the subject with literature, especially for the description of the 

 human rugae in the embryo and infant, see Carl Gegenbaur. Mor- 

 pholog. Jahrbuch, IV, 673. 



The following embraces a brief description of the rugae in man 

 and a list of names which will be employed in this paper. 



Two kinds of rugse are recognized, the longitudinal and the 

 transverse. The longitudinal lie in the median line and answer to 

 the line of union between the right and left maxillae and premax- 

 illse; the transverse lie across the palate and are composed of a 

 right and left set. 



The longitudinal kind is divided into two parts, viz. : the raphe, 

 or tlie seam-like line which occupies the middle of the palate at the 




1888.]

255 



maxillae, and the incisive pad which is an elliptical or pear-shaped 

 body which answers to the position of the incisive foramen. 



The raphe is ordinarily composed of two parts, one of which 

 represents the median line and the other is deflected from it to the 

 left at the posterior free end. (See figs. 2, 4, 7.) 



The rugse extend back no farther than the first molar tooth. The 

 region answers to an imaginary plane which bisect the infra-orbital 

 foramina. The rugse are composed of papules which are arranged 

 in series, an arrangement which is most evident in the posterior 

 folds. The folds are smallest where the membranes are the thin- 

 nest and are the largest where they are the thickest. 



As a rule the incisive pad is in line with the raphe, but it may 

 be deflected (see fig. 3) or continued forwards between the central 

 incisors (see fig. 5). Occasionally the anterior end can be seen from 

 the front lying in the interval between the teeth named. It may 

 persist in the aged long after the loss of the incisors. When the 

 deflection is decided it enters into the causation of torus palatinus} 



FtGURE I. 



The arch is wide and moderately arched. The rugs as a rule are 

 entire, — the exceptions being both first post-sutural rugse— and the 

 last post-sutural on the left side. The neck folds are conspicuous. 

 The largest transverse fold lies between the canine teeth or be- 

 tween them and the first bicuspid and answers to the suture between 

 the maxilla and the premaxilla. It will receive here the name of

 vol. 94, 21. 




256 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



the sutural ruga. The sutural ruga is the widest of any in the 

 entire series. It is usually inclined somewhat backward, but never 

 forward. A deep sulcus is often seen at the base of the sutural fold 

 anteriorily. 



The sutural fold divides the hard palate into two parts, the pre- 

 sutural and the post-sutural. The pre-sutural space thus answers to 

 the premaxilla and has but one ruga' (see fig. 2). The post-sutural 

 space has four to seven rugae and are named in order from before 

 backward the first, second, third, fourth, etc. Of these folds the third 

 is the best developed. As a rule the first and the second are the 

 least so and are represented usually by small nodules, or by groups 

 of papules, at the outer portion of the vault. They are often aborted. 

 The fifth, sixth, and seventh are also often aborted or represented by 

 faintly expressed broken sinuate lines. The presutural portion of 

 the vault is nearly flat and is of a special use in presenting a firm 

 surface for the tip of the tongue to press against in mastication and 

 in speech. The post-sutural space is concave with an abrupt declivity 

 forwards. The alveolar processes of the molar range and the declivity 

 named bound the true palatal vault. It presents extraordinary 

 varieties, no two subjects being in all respects the sarue. 



The pre-sutural rugae were found in an examination of 90 ex- 

 amples of hard palates, present on the right side alone in 11, on 

 the left side alone in 1, on both sides, 17, absent in 50, doubtful in 

 11. • Occasionally a system of minute raised folds extends from the 

 raphe outward in the spaces between the rugie. 



The roof of the mouth at the region of the incisors and the bicus- 

 pids is distinguished fi'ora that of the molars by the presence of folds 

 of gum-tissue placed at the necks of the teeth. These may receive 

 the names of the neck-folds. They indicate a disposition of the 

 mucous membrane to be in excess at the parts where the palate is 

 the narrowest. They often entirely occupy the pre-sutural space. 

 The rugae as a whole, are the best developed in the regions where 

 the neck-folds are found. 



Each palatal ruga is divided into a median and a lateral part. 

 The median part, as a rule, is crescentic in outline with the convex- 

 ity directed forwards. The lateral is directed forwards. Taken 

 together the last named folds are arranged in vertical series, (i. e. with 

 the main axes of the crowns of the teeth) and are either separated by 



1 Some of the figures show neck-folds which must not be confounded with rugae. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 257 



inlervals of equal size or are clustered at the alveolar border op- 

 posite the bicuspids. 



FlGUKE 2. 



The arch is flat and wide, the rugc-e entire ; no hyperostosis is 

 present ; moderate lateral concresence is seen on the left side. 



When the two parts, (the median and the lateral) are contiguous 

 the rugse may be said to be entire. But when they are separated 

 by intervals more or less appreciable they may be said to be broken. 

 In palates of a moderate curvature i. e. midway between the flat and 

 the high vaults, the folds may be evenly disposed and be without break 

 on one side while they are irregidar and broken on the other. The 

 left side is commonly the most developed, a feature which the rugae 

 exhibit in common with the mandible, the left ramus of wdiich is 

 commonly the larger. 



An elliptical exostosis Avhich is often met with on the roof of the 

 mouth is almost always larger on the left side. The left sutural 

 ruga (see fig. 3) is generally prolonged back farther than is the 

 right. A similar disposition is seen in the first post-sutural ruga 

 but to a less degree. The post-sutural ruga3 especially on the right 

 side (see fig. 9) may extend obliquely forward. The third is com- 

 monly so placed, but the fourth, fifth and even the second may il- 

 lustrate this disposition (see fig. 8). As opposed to exostosis the 

 term hyperostosis will be employed to denote the general excess of 

 bone deposition along the line of the intermaxillary suture. It is a 




258 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



common form of hypertrophy in the Anglo-American and one which 

 has a distinct clinical significance (see fig. 5). 



Figure 3. 



The palate is moderately high arched. The lateral elements are 

 elongated. The median elements are either two faint to be apparent 

 or are absent. 



The right lateral incisor is absent and the incisive pad shows an 

 inclination to the side of defect. The left sutural fold is directed 

 backward at the raphe. 



The union of the riglit sutural and post-sutural rugse so as to 

 present a fork-like figure, the arms of the fork projecting outwards, 

 is frequently seen. 



The incisive pad, the raphe and the two sutural rugse in rare 

 instances may coalesce and give rise to a conspicuous cruciform 

 figure. 



The vertically placed lateral ends of the rugse are by far the 

 most constant of any parts of the series. They are especially well 

 developed in high narrow vaults.' 



The course of the posterior palatine vessels and nerves serve as a 

 guide to interesting conditions of the hard palate. 



The mucous membrane is pale where it overlies tissues which are 

 not in contact with the bone. The interval between the raphe and 



1 In the horse the roof of the mouth is very vascular. In Mephitis the pre- 

 sutural portion appears to be in a similar condition. The exact limitation of this 

 part of the roof is of interest and, so far as it goes, supports the position taken that 

 the rugoe are naturally divided into a pre-sutural and a post sutural set.

the sides of the vault is marked by a whitish surface which yields 

 to pressure. In some individuals this motion can be traced as far 

 forward as the first post-sutural fold. The tract is best developed 

 when the roof is normally formed. With a flat arch and a median 

 exostosis present, the track is small. With rugse well shown, but 

 broken, the place of the interruption occurs across the track. The 

 pale tracks appear to be entirely absent in high, acute arches. An 

 association of the track and the color marking of the hard palate 

 can also be detected. The high-arched palates are uniformly of a 

 red color, while the flat arches are red only along the median line 

 and at the region of the gum. A test exists here for the rate of 

 blood vessel activity of the palatine structures and, by inference, of 

 the rates of development of the maxilla. 



Figure 4, 

 The palate is normal in curvature. The incisive pad and raphe are 

 continuous. The sutural folds are entire, the left fold extending 

 farther up along the raphe than does the right. Median concresence 

 is seen on the left side. 



Variations of the Rug^. 



At the risk of repeating some of the fixcts of the preceding 

 description it is proposed to discuss under this head the principal 

 variations of the rugse. They Avill be included under the following 

 propositions : 



I. The rugse of the left side tend to be the better developed (see 

 figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,). 




260 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



II. The rugae of high laterally compressed as well as the wide, 

 flat vaults are apt to be entire. (See fig. 8.) 



III. The rugae of vaults whose median suture has become the 

 seat of general hyperostosis are always broken. (See. fig. 5.) 



I. Not only is the group of rugae on the left side more prominent 

 than on the right, but the distance from the median line to the 

 canine tooth is greater on the left than on the right side. The 

 pre-sutural space is slightly the more prominent on the left. The 

 left sutural rugsc is apt to be inclined backward as it approaches 

 the median line to a point beyond that reached by the right. The 

 right side exhibits a forked sutural ruga, and a larger first post- 

 sutural fold than is seen on the left (see p. 261). The obliquely 

 placed last post-sutural fold is as peculiar to the right side as the de- 

 flected sutural is to the left. 



II. The rugae of the high compressed vaults not only tend to 

 remain unbroken but are well developed. The membranes are 

 thick, cushiony and vascular. The incisors are thrown forward, 

 since they cannot be accommodated in the narrow space between 

 the canines, or the teeth last named remain out of the arch. 



The skeleton is slight and the tonsils large if not hypertrophied. 



The hard palate with a wide, flat arch is associated with thin 

 rugae whose intervals are wide (see figs. 2 and 9). The sutural 

 rugae tend to be deflected less than in the other types. A hyperosto- 

 sis is common. 



III. The form of the wide arch which is modified by the hyper- 

 ostosis of the median structures of the palate is an illustration of 

 the disposition of the bones where they unite one to another by 

 suture to exhibit excess of nutrition.^ 



The raphe is exaggerated, a median bony ridge extends along its 

 line, the pre-sutural region is occupied by thick membranes and 

 prominent neck-folds. The left sutural ruga is apt to incline back- 

 ward at the median line. The right sutural fold is united with the 

 third near the raphe. This group is frequently met with in subjects 

 of nasal catarrh. 



The RUGiE OF man as compared with those of the 



LOWER ANIMALS. 



A generally accepted method of study embraces the variations of 

 human structures and those of the lower animals in which these 

 " variations " are constant. 



^ See a paper by the writer, Am. Journ. of the American Sciences, 1870, 405. 




1888.] 



NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



261 



Most variations in human anatomy are said to be reversions. 

 While this method is a most valuable one it has a limited use when 

 applied to the study of the rugae, excepting in the instance of the 

 broken rugae, and even here the comparison is not exact. 



The human vngve derive their peculiarity from two causes: 

 Fnst, the divergence from the median line of "the dental arches as 

 tliey are traced from before backward; this is much greater in man 

 than it is in the lower animals. Out of 96 examples of dental 

 arches examined by me 58 were found to be deflected more on the 

 left than on the right (see figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 9,), 21 deflected more on 

 the right than the left, (see figs. 1, 2) while 17 only were symmetrical. 

 If, as I have assumed, the folds in part at least are the result of compres- 

 sion it follows that abrupt and varying deviations of the boundaries 

 of the palate must greatly disturb the harmonious development of 

 its rugae. 



The deviations of the curves of the vault especially when inter- 

 rupted by a disposition to hyperostosis must also be a disturbing 

 influence. In 90 examples of palates the hyperostosis itself was 

 found in 51. This is certainly a remarkably high proportion and 

 when it is remembered that the specimens were from the mouths of 

 patients who were suffering from chronic nasal catarrh, the associa- 

 tion IS suggestive of a relation between coincident causes. 



Figure 5. 

 The arch is wide. The raphe hes on a conspicuous ridge which 

 forms a hyperostosis. The rugae are irregular, while some in advance 

 are long and entire, others aie converted into clu-ters of coarse 

 papillae. 



Again, in 90 examinations the sides of the vaults along the range 

 of the bicuspids and molars was in 27 instances, both right and left. 




262 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



nearly vertical, in 47 both sides inclined moderately outward, 3 had 

 right side vertical and left inclined, 4 had the left side vertical and 

 right inclined, and in 9 the inclination was undetermined. 



Second, the extraordinary modifications in the proportions of the 

 face. The face stunted as it is in its anteroposterior dimensions 

 compensates for this defect in a great tendency to downward growth. 

 The pi-emaxilla is enormously thickened as it enters into the com- 

 position of the mouth ; the sides of the vault including the alveolar 

 processes are greatly elongated ; and the sutiiral line of the maxillae 

 tends to become hyperostosed in the region of the rugae or a separate 

 exostosis forms back of it on the free surface of the palate. It has 

 been seen how the presence of the hyperostosis modifies the shapes 

 of the rugae. The firm suture between the premaxilla and the 

 maxilla determines the greater size of the ruga which answers to it. 

 The sides of the vault drag the lateral part of the rugae of the post- 

 sutural set from a horizontal to a vertical and forward position. 

 The median hyperostosis breaks the rugae into parts, — a condition 

 never seen so far as I know in any quadruped. The changes are in 

 illustration of the well known law that peripheral structures are 

 conformable to the deeper lying tissues with which they are in 

 correlation. 



One of the most conspicuous appearances in the human rugae is 

 the approach of two or three folds towards one another either at the 

 median or lateral ends. It is most marked in children in the lat- 

 eral ends (where they are clustered toward the deciduous canines 

 and molars) and in the adults at the median ends anteriorly. 



The third and fourth rugae of the right side have marked special 

 dispositions to incline forward and inward, often cutting off the first 

 and second folds or causing them to disappear. The convergence may 

 go so far as to effect union between the different folds. Especially 

 is this the case between the sutural fold and the third on the right 

 side, by means of which the forked appearance is seen (see fig. 8). 

 In some examples the sutural fold is united with the third be- 

 hind, and with the pre-sutural in front. 



In 90 specimens examined I found the lateral ends of the lefl rugae 

 convergent in 19 ; the lateral ends of those of the right side in 10; 

 and on both sides in 11. 



In the same number of specimens I found the median ends con- 

 vergent in the left side in 6, on the right side in 4, and on both 

 sides in 5. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 263 



The rugse may be convergent on one side and transverse on the 

 other. It is thus seen that the disposition of the rugse to form little 

 clusters is noticeable. 



is 



Iv^^^^^^rr 



FiGURB 6. 



The palate is wide but with deep recesses from a moderately hirrh 

 arch back of the sulural rugae. The lateral elements on the left are 

 regular and elongated; those on the right are unusually irregular, 

 and first and second post-suturals very oblique The median ele- 

 ments on both sides are strangely disturbed. Median concresence 

 exists on both sides. 



The inclination for the third, fourth and fifth rugae on the right 

 side to incline forward is especially marked. 



In 90 specimens I found the right rugse thus inclined in 33, the 

 left only in 2 while in both right and left, 16. In the whole number 

 the inclination of the third rugae is the rule. The disposition is 

 marked in palates with hyperostosis. 



The median half of each ruga may incline independently of the 

 lateral, but the inclined fold is, as a rule, entire. The degree of incli- 

 nation is variable but it may be expected to be so great that the 

 sutural and post-sutural folds may unite. 



The approach of the rugse one to another their entire length is 

 much less frequently seen than the foregoing. The sutural, the 

 third and the fourth post-suturals may be coalescent. In 90 ex- 

 amples this was noted on the right side 9 times, on the left 6 and 

 on both 2. 



The union of the sutural and pre-sutural I have seen but once. 

 It waa symmetrical. 




264 



PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[1888. 



The folds may be contiguous only. In 90 examples I found the 

 arrangement on the right side 3 times, on the left 1, and for both 5. 



It is probable that some forces create the variations above nuted, 

 which are distinct from those already named. They are evidently 

 often out of harmony with one another,-the right side exhibiting 

 their effects oftener than the left. Sometimes they are oj)erating 

 on the ends of the folds, sometimes in their entire length of the median 

 halves. That they are correlative with morbid phenomena is un- 

 doubted (see p. 269). For the clumping of the rug?e their entire 

 length is often found in atrophic foetid catarrh, and in the senile 

 state. But it may be so by coincidence. No data exists which covers 

 the entire range of appearances. Certainly nothing comparable to 

 such dispositions are seen in the lower animals. 



The term concresence is an exact and convenient term to use in 

 describing this class of modification of the rugae. 



The common abortion of the first and second post-sutural rugae 

 is not the least instructive of the changes affected by concresence. 



llhlililllllllllHniK 



Figure 7. 

 The incisorial pad is divided by a transverse groove. The raphe 

 shows a tendency to right and left subdivision. The left sutural ruga 

 is deflected backward along the raphe. The post-sutural rugae are 

 irregular. A small pre-sutural ruga is evident. The right post- 

 sutural rugae tend to be oblique, especially in their displaced median 

 elements. Median and lateral concresence is shown on the right side. 



The deflection of the left sutural fold backward along the raph6 

 is probably also an example of concresence. But for some reason 

 it does not tend to unite with the post-sutural. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 265 



Of 90 examples I found the left sutural ruga thus deflected in 49 

 instances, the right, in 3 instances only, and on both right and left, 

 5 instances. In all the other examples the fold was transverse. In 

 deflection it must be noted that the ruga after reaching the raph^ 

 is thence abruptly turned so as to be parallel v/ith that structure. 

 Both the right and the left fold may be inclined back before ap- 

 proaching the raphe or may not reach it at all. 



The forms of the rugae are never pathological as I venture to 

 define that term. The question to what extent variations of struct- 

 ure may be said to be pathological is no longer a novel one. The 

 fact that the forces operating in the economy often antagonize is 

 generally accepted. Upon this antagonism the approach to sym- 

 metry as seen in the paired structures alone depends. In the 

 plastron of a turtle ( Chrysemys pida) in my possession, the plates 

 exhibit a constant disposition for those of the right side to crowd 

 and minimize those of the left. The same disposition for one side to 

 gain ascendency is seen in all paired structures which form by their 

 growth inward a median suture or raphe. If such minor variations 

 were to be called pathological every living creature would be an 

 epitome of morbid anatomy. Anatomical variation I assume to be 

 a better term for such deviations unless the structures are hurtful to 

 the individual or at least tend to be so. A pathological condition 

 is one in which the final eflect is to create distress • or to excite 

 lesion. Prof. Alpheus Hyatt has described certain distorted shells 

 found by him as constituting pathological species. Are not such 

 species degraded, or reverted rather than pathological forms ? The 

 comparison sometimes made between the horn of the rhinoceros 

 and the epidermic hypertrophies which appear upon the surface of 

 man and some of the lower animals, is based upon the conception 

 that the outgrowths are in both instances of the same nature, — that 

 they are both pathological and differ only in the single feature that 

 the rhinoceros by the law of selection has utilized a horn which 

 happened to appear at a convenient locality. To my mind the 

 structure is not pathological unless it expresses perverted function 

 or interferes with a function ; not only this but that it interferes in 

 an abrupt, obstructive manner. If it does not so appear but in 

 Such guise as to encourage the animal to use it ; the organ should 

 be named an anatomical variation. 



The word pathology is an anachronism in a system of biology. 

 It originated at the hands of observers who had imperfect concep-

tions (if indeed they may be said to have any at all) on the general 

 physiological laws operating in all the tissue changes of the body. 

 What was once " morbid " is now natural. If the word is to be 

 retained by naturalists, it should have a strictly medical application 

 — the one originally designed for it by practical men. 



The CORRELATION BETWEEN THE RUG^ AND THE INTERIOR 

 OF THE NOSE. 



I have met with ten examples in which the left side of the nose 

 Avas smaller than the right and in which the same side ol the hard 

 palate was also the smaller. Care must be taken to distinguish the 

 common variety of narrowing of the nose by a deflection of the 

 septum from the much rarer form or reduction of the chambers in 

 all directions. 



In six cases the right side of the nasal chamber was the larger 

 and a corresponding increase in size of the right half of the palate 

 was detected. 



But the association between palatal and nasal conditions is by no 

 means uniform and at the same time I cannot conclude that the 

 cases brought forward in evidence were coincidences. I have stud- 

 ies of individual cases in Avhich not only was harmony present 

 between the proportions of the nose and the hard palate but between 

 these structures and the cranium as well. 



It may be said that, in a manner, the law of symmetry is not with- 

 out exemplifications in the harmonies of the ari'angement of the 

 sides of the hard palate, with the nasal chambers and with the cor- 

 responding side of the head but that this exemplification is subject 

 to so many exceptions by the operation of minor disturbing factors 

 as to be rarely present. 



In examples of hyperostosis of the inter-maxillery suture the in- 

 ferior turbinated bones are high and apparently compressed. This 

 condition is often associated with imperfect development of the vomer 

 at the choana. The same peculiarity is found in high V-shaped 

 vaults. 



A well defined group of subjects exhibit intumescent states of the 

 membranes of the pre maxillary portion of the nasal chamber, a 

 rounded nodule projecting from the floor of the vestibule, a prom- 

 inent anterior end of the inferior turbinated bone, and a tumid state 

 of the membrane covering the septum. While such pronounced 

 morbid appearances are seen in the front of the chamber the remain- 

 der of the nasal surface is perfectly healthy. Coincident with these

peculiarities of the nose the roof of the mouth is distinguished by a 

 small incisive pad and coalescence of the sutural and the third post- 

 sutural folds. The tonsils are moderately enlarged. 



Figure 8. 

 The arch is narrow and high, the pre maxillary portions being 

 thrown forward. Hence the space between the sutural rugae and the 

 incisorial pad and all the parts in advance of the sutural rugse are 

 exceptionally open. The third post rugse is confluent with the sutural 

 on both sides. The pre sutural rugae are absent. 



The Relation between the Rug^e and the Teeth. 



The relation existing between the rugse and the teeth is not as 

 important as would at first sight appear. For the pre-maxilla it 

 may be said that no influence is exerted by the incisor teeth over 

 the pre-sutural rugte. The sutural ruga is directly opposite the 

 canine teeth, the first post-sutural. directly between the canine and 

 the first bicuspid, the second ruga opposite the bicuspid, etc. In 

 the Proceedings of the Acad, of Nat. Sci. of Phi la. p. 310, 1882, I 

 proposed a system of naming of the ])ai'ts in accordance with these 

 facts. But it is less satisfactory tlian the one used in this paper. 



Nevertheless the following statements would confirm the position 

 assumed that some connection between the rugae and the teeth must 

 be accepted to exist. 




268 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



The axis of the incisive pad when deflected from that of the 

 median line is inclined toward the side w'hich is minimized by the 

 non-appearance or extraction of one of the incisor teeth of the per- 

 manent set, by the eruption of a tooth on the buccal or labial side 

 of its arch, or by some third related cause (see fig. 3). 



In one adult subject whose palatal vault exhibited straight, reg- 

 ular, unbroken rugae on the right side retained on the left all the 

 rugse broken and parts of two entering into the composition of the 

 pre-sutural and the sutural. The left side was narrower than the 

 right. It is not likely that the irregularity of the rugae on the left 

 side was independent of the fact that the lateral incisor and the 

 second bicuspid were absent from the upper jaw, and that the sec- 

 ond bicuspid on the same side of the lower jaw was also absent, its 

 place being taken by the second milk molar which had never been 

 changed from the time of its eruption and was in all respects a 

 normal, healthy tooth. The left side of the face was slightly small- 

 er than the right. 



In a girl of twelve years the rugae were normal on the left but on 

 the right the sutural fold was forked and the remaining folds broken. 

 On the left side the left second bicuspid tooth was absent, while 

 on the right both teeth were in position. 



It is always of importance to remember that the mouths of chil- 

 dren in whom the deciduous canines and molars are yet in position 

 at a time when the permanent incisors and the first permanent 

 molar have been erupted, that the rugse exhibit a disposition to 

 approach one another toward these teeth. Is it possible that the 

 change from the infantile arrangement where the folds are entire, 

 regular and symmetrical to that of the older child, where the ac- 

 quired variations take place, is due either to the retention of the 

 deciduous canines and molars, or to the retardation in development 

 of the permanent bicuspid teeth? 



The i-egion of these teeth is an exceedingly active one within the 

 maxilla since the germs of the permanent canine and of the bicus- 

 pids are well advanced to completion. At the same time the pe- 

 ripheral structures are not changing in correspondence. Hence an 

 element of disturbance is created. 



Clinical applications. 



It is evident that if, as has been claimed, the rugse are modified by 

 nutritive and developmental processes they will have clinical signif- 

 icance also. The application will be especially evident in the

manner in which the rugse are aborted by protusion of the premax- 

 illary elements, and of the hyperostosis of the structures at the 

 raphe. When the vault is flat — the rugse tending to be s/mmeLrical 

 though feebly developed, — a condition is present which is often 

 found associated with chr'onic nasal ratarrh of the atrophic type. 

 If the arch is wide the sides of the palate ant! the alveolar processes

 The hard palate is without neck-folds, is of low arch and is wide. 

 The raphe is nearly obliterated. The rugse are liroken. The lat- 

 eral half of the tliird post-sutural fold extends obliquely forward and 

 is in line with one of the median elements (probably of the second). 

 No similar disposition is seen on the left. Lateral concresence is 

 seen on the left side. 

 are not well developed, the ruga? are gathered in a clump upon an 

 anterior declivity of low inclination, the turbiual scrolls are small, 

 and the membranes nonerectile. The teeth in such individuals are 

 large especially the incisors, the patient is predisposed to premature 

 recession of the gums from about the necks of the teeth and to 

 suppurative afiections of their roots.^ 



The Incisive Pad. The pad is often of a bluish red color when 

 the palate elsewhere is of a pale hue. At other times the pad is of 

 pink color and the base surrounded by a deep blue line. Thus the 

 pad may be congested either in whole or in part while the rest of

 gum see a paper by the author in Dental Cosmos, I880, xxvii, 329.

the hard palate be entirely free. In a man fifty six years of age 

 from whom I had removed a number of polypi the pad was the 

 seat of soreness and pain for a week after the operation. It consti- 

 tuted the only annoyance which followed upon an operation of 

 exceptional extent. In children who have been operated upon for 

 deflected septum the necks of the teeth are surrounded by a pur- 

 plish red line as long as the plug is worn in the nose. 



Absence of Rugit. The rugie may disappear by pressure from 

 within, as from a naevus or a fibrous tumor, and from without, as 

 from the pressure from a plate for artificial teeth. The absorption 

 of the alveolar process after the extraction of teeth, as a rule, induce 

 the absorption of the rugse, but occasionally the rugae persist and 

 are found lying directly across the position of the former dental 

 arch. 



Medico-Legal Value of the Bugce. The persistence of the rugae 

 after death leads to the conclusion that they may aflfoi'd valuable 

 signs by which the body can be identified, for during the processes 

 of decomposition the mucous membrane of the hard palate is 

 among the last to be lost. When the positions of the rugae are re- 

 corded (as in the event of a patient having been recently under the 

 care of a dentist and the impression of the rugte having been taken 

 in plaster,) it is certainly true that the folds could be used in connec- 

 tion with the teeth, or even in the absence of these organs, in 

 identifying the subject. 



Congenital Syphilis. In congenital syphilis I have often observed 

 that while the roof of the mouth especially at the anterior part was 

 of a deep red color from inflammati(m that the rugae were milk white. 

 The folds become swollen and painful in acute inflammation of the 

 roof of the mouth and infiltrated in cases of prolonged suppuration 

 from the alveolar processes. 



In the diagnosis of syphilis this appearance is of importance. 

 While the characters of the teeth as caused by scarlet fever may be 

 much the same as those produced \fy syphilis yet in the sequelae of 

 the disease first named the hard palate yields no characters. In 

 syphilis more or less congestion if not inflammation appears to be 

 constantly present. 



The study presented in the foregoing pages is based entirely upon 

 examinations made upon living subjects. Forms of mouths which 

 occurred to nie as interesting were selected and casts of the rugae 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 271 



and teeth taken in plaster with great care.^ The material therefore 

 is not of the average. It is based upon the hard palate of individ- 

 uals known to have some disease associated with disturbed states of 

 secretion of the nasal chambers. 



In order that the study should have a more extended application 

 it was thought to be desirable before any exact clinical conclusion 

 could be drawn that a study of similar extent be based on material 

 known to be derived from entirely healthy individuals. 



To make such examinations I visited the State Eastern Peniten- 

 tiary in this city and by the courtesy of Dr. W. D. Robinson, the 

 physician of the Institution, was enabled to stuby the mouths and 

 nasal chambers of the inmates. In this way ninety examinations 

 were recorded. 



In no instance was hyperostosis present in the form spoken of in 

 the foregoing pages. Nor was a single case of hyperostosis of the roof 

 of the mouth back of the region of the rugse seen. In a word no form 

 of rugJB was detected which was broken by the descent of the median 

 structures. 



In twenty-two examples the raphe was sufficiently prominent to 

 form a slight fullness which could be felt by the finger. The re- 

 maining fifty-eight examples were perfectly smooth. 



The rugie were very commonly of the form exhibited in Figs. 1 

 or 2 with a disposition for the folds to be concrescent at their outer 

 ends. The examples of the left sutural rugse deflected along the 

 line of the raphe were but six in number ; moderate degree of 

 asymmetry of the sides of the roof in seven ; conci'csence of the 

 right sutural and post-sutural as to form a fork-like figure in but 

 three. 



It is evident that the variations of the arrangement of the rugse 

 were within a much narrower range than in the ninety cases from 

 subjects from other sources. 



The roof of the mouth presented no narrowing of the vault with 

 compression as seen in Fig. 8, and no flat wide palate as seen in 

 Fig. 9. Thus the extremes of variation — viz., of the high narrrow 

 vault and the low, wide vault were absent. But one instance of a 

 moderately compressed vault was seen and in this example the 

 pre-raaxilloe were not thrown forward. 



1 I desire in this connection to acknowledge my indebtedness to many of my 

 friends especially to Dr. L. Ashley Faught, Dr. E. C. Kirk and Dr. J. M. McGrath. 

 Dr. J. W. White and Dr. W. Storer How of the S. S. White Dental Mfg. Co,, also 

 g;reatly aided me in the investigation. 




272 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



Respecting the presence of catarrhal affections in the cases it is 

 necessary to say that not a single man among the entire number ex- 

 amined had complained to Dr. Robinson of any of the symptoms of 

 these diseases. I detected small quantities of secretion in the nasal 

 pharynx in rifteen instances. I cannot admit that this circumstance 

 had any significance in the absence of any of the usual appearances 

 of the membranes. 



The teeth and nasal chambers were also examined but nothing 

 found which is of special mention. 



Conclusions. The following conclusions may be drawn from the 

 statements made in the paper. 



(1) That the range of variation in the roof of the mouth and its 

 folds is greater in subjects of nasal catarrh than in those who are 

 free from this disease. 



(2) That the variations of the rugse are different on the two 

 sides of the roof 



(3) That excess of development of the pre-maxilla and the hori- 

 zontal plate of the maxilla, especially at the anterior portion, con- 

 stitutes a condition which is found in about fifty per cent, of cases of 

 chronic nasal catarrh. 



(4) That chronic nasal catarrh is found associated with so many 

 phases of asymmetry of the rugae of the hard palate and the dental 

 arches that the disease should be studied as a morbid action which 

 is based upon morphological elements and not alone upon climatic 

 conditions.

CONTRIBTJTIONS TO THE LIFE HISTORIES OF PLANTS, NO. II. 

 BY TIIOAfAS MEEIIAN. 



The leading facts, given in these papers, have been conimuwicated 

 verbally during the year 1888 to the Academy of Natural Sciences 

 of Philadelphia or its Botanical Section. In pre])aring them for 

 publication, it was believed they might add to the interest of the meet- 

 ing of the American Association for the Advancement of Science at 

 Cleveland, if read there prior to a full publication here. This state- 

 ment is necessary to explain the somewhat controversial manner,^ 

 intended to excite debate, in which the facts are presented. The 

 remarks of those who discussed the papers, are briefly given in the 

 Botanical Gazette, for September 1888. 



Some new facts in the life History of Yucca. — In the extremely 

 fa^scinating subject of the relation of insects to flowers no plant 

 possesses a greater interest than the Yucca. It is assumed that in- 

 sects' visits are arranged for cross-fertilization, and this again on the 

 assumption that cross-fertilization must in some way, be a great 

 benefit to the species or to the race. This conclusion is a fair one. 

 Some good has been found from cross-fertilization, and some flowers 

 seem only to produce seed when cross-fertilized -but in Yucca we 

 have the anomaly of a floral structure so arranged that it can scarcely 

 pollinate itself or in any way receive pollen except by artificial aid 

 and yet that arrangement results, in so far as we can see, simply from 

 the use of its own pollen. There is in Yucca a more wonderful rela- 

 tion between the insect and the flower fertilized than possibly in any 

 oiher case. Professor Riley, to whom the great credit of this 

 wonderful discovery is mainly if not wholly due, has well expressed 

 this intimate relation in the insects name Pronuha yucca.sella, and 

 yet it is evident to those who observe closely the working of this 

 wonderful arrangement, that it has no relation to cross-fertilization, 

 but results in self-fertilization. In most cases, as clearly shown by 

 the observations of Prof. Riley, the pistil receives through the medium 

 of the insect the pollen from its own flower, or at best the pollen 

 from the flowei's on the same or adjacent plants; which is equally 

 self-fertilization. Just why this plant should be put to all this 

 trouble to get results through an agent, with no other result than it 

 would obtain if it did the work itself, is surely a problem worthy of 

 any endeavor to solve. Mankind has servants and slaves, and even 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 275 



small insects, drone bees, and other creatures live in indolence by 

 the sweat of other brows. There are many parallels between plants 

 and animals. Is Yucca to l)e a case of absolute servitude on the 

 part of the insect, from sheer indolence on the part of the Yucca to 

 do its own work? It seems to me we shall not be able to di'aw the 

 veil from this great mystery till we make continuous and careful 

 observations of all the facts in its history, and place them on record 

 for comparison with those which others may make. 



Prof. Riley once made the remarkable statement that he had seen 

 the Yucca Moth collect pollen, and thrust it down the tube of the 

 stigma, as if it knew that some such process was necessary to insure 

 fertilization. Dr. Engelmann had found in the Yuccas he examined, 

 that the apex of the pistil was not stigmatic, — the receptive portion 

 was low down in the tube. The two observations, taken together, 

 gave color to the supposed object of the insect. I have show^n, (see 

 Proceedings of the Meetings at Cincinnatti, Saratoga and Buffalo,) 

 that pollen applied to the apex in Y. angustlfo/ia, and protected by 

 gauze from the insect, resulted in seed just as well as when the work 

 was done by an insect. The tubular character noted by Dr. Engel- 

 mann cannot therefore be a constant one; and we shall have to 

 admit that the reasoning of the insect which led it to thrust the 

 pollen down the tube in the other species, leads it to perceive there 

 is no tube in Y. angustifolia, and that the application of pollen to 

 the bare apex is sufficient in this species. 



Up to this season I had never been able to detect the insect be- 

 have in the plants around my house, as Professor Riley saw^ them 

 behave; but I have always conceded that he is too careful and too 

 close an observer to have been mistaken in such an observation. 

 The record of the act of the insect thrusting its tongue down the 

 stigmatic tube, from so accurate a naturalist, needs no confirma- 

 tion from any one, however one may be allowed to hold his judgment 

 in suspense as to the object of the insect in such behavior; not then 

 as confirming Prof. Riley, but as part of my observations of this year, I 

 desire to say that I have recently seen an insect at the same task. It 

 worked its proboscis up and down the tube of the pistil, much as a 

 sportsman would load his gun. 



I find, in this region Yucca filamentosa commenced to bloom this 

 year about the end of June. Some plants will bloom a full week, or 

 occasionally ten days before others, though yeai's ago, all the plants 

 under my notice came from root cuttings of one stock and not from 




276 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



seed. The flower? he^in to expaud au lioiir before sun-down, assum- 

 ing a canipanulate form by dark. By sunri.-^e the next morning 

 they are closed, and they remain ch)jtd till an hour before sun-i-et 

 when they again expand, and go through another day as 

 before. But at the third evening's expansion they become almost 

 rotate, closing again tlie next morning but only to wither and fall 

 away. The flower opens and fades within three days. 



During the first week or ten days of the flowering ])eriod, an 

 enormous amount of moisture exudes from every part of the flower. 

 It trickles down the outer surface of the perianths, collecting in 

 drops at the apices of the lobes, sometimes almost covering the leaves 

 with spots where the drops have fallen and indicating a somewhat 

 gummy character. The pistil is completely covered with minute 

 bullae, from which the same kind of liquid exude-s. It is not a sweet 

 liquid, indeed differs from pure water only in having a very slight 

 trace of bitterness. The moths become very active just after sun- 

 set, traveling up and down rapidly over the moistened stigma, 

 my idea being that they were feeding on the moisture, and that this 

 probability also included the case of the one noted above as thrust- 

 ing its proboscis down the tube of the stigma. But the insect's 

 motions are so rapid that in the twilight 1 could not feel al>solutely 

 sure of the objects for which they were laboring so hard.' 



The most interesting part of my observations comesin here. When 

 about half tlie blossoms on the huge panicle had matured, the pro- 

 duction of moisture cea.sed. On the evening of the eighth of Jul)' I 

 could find no trace of an exudation of moisture, nor was there during 

 the whole remainder of the flowering period. Strange to say my 

 friends whose attention was called to this sudden cessation of a 

 watery overflow all suggested, "did you note any peculiar condition 

 of the atmosphere ?" I call attention to this here because it is so 

 common in rea.soning on similar phenomena to .say the atmo.sphere 

 was so-and-so therefore this or that resulted. It is the bane of 

 exact philosophical deductions that such hasty assumptions are com- 

 mon. We may \vith more propriety remember that in trees and 

 plants generally a large amount of moisture is stored in the tissue 



1 This paper was read at the Cleveland meeting of the American Association 

 for the Advancement of Science, where Prof. Riley was present and it is due to 

 this eminent naturalist to say that he insisted on his former view th.it the sole ob- 

 ject of the insect in working down the pistil, was to ensure the fertilization of the 

 flower.

durins: winter, appavantly ready for the enormous draft on the stor- 

 age ])asins which the sudden burst of masses of young foliage must 

 entail in spring. All know how maples and other trees bleed on the 

 slightest wound before the bursting of the leaf, — and how completely 

 destitute of moisture the tissue seems a short time afterwards. All 

 bleeding ceases as the young leaf has fully expanded. AVill not the 

 same necessity exist for a provision of moisture for the enormous 

 number of juicy succulent flowers the Yucca has suddenly to pro- 

 duce? '^[ay there not be enough and to spare in the earlier period, 

 with none to waste towai'ds the last? These suggestions are all useful 

 as clews to further discov(M-ies. The danger in science is that we 

 rest satisfied with plausibilities, and mistake them for facts. 



My object is to show that the much discussed Yucca is yet 

 a comparatively unexplored field; and that its unknown life- 

 history yet promises to be one of the most interesting subjects the 

 teleologist can possibly give his attention to. 



A study of the Hydrangea In relaiioii to cross-fertilization. — That 

 many flowers are arranged for ci'oss-fertilization needs no argu- 

 ment to sustain it, nor is it less certain that some flowers can only 

 be fertilized througii the aid of wind or insects. Sprengel, it is well 

 known in the early part of the present century, ])laced this beyond 

 doubt. The great question is not. do ])Iants generally cross-fertilize, 

 but why do they do it? jNfr. Darwin's great work in this connection 

 has been to ])rove that plants abhor in and in breeding, that the 

 struggle for life is necessarily the chief object of existence, and that 

 cross-fertilization tends to make the race stronger and better fitted 

 to engage in this struggle than close breeding would do. The results 

 of' many of ]Mr. Darwin's experiments sustain his views, as do those 

 of many others; but to niv mind just as large a number do not 

 sustain them. Mr. Darwin himself has candidly stated that con- 

 tinuous self-fertilization does not in the least impair the fertility of 

 the race. Mere negative vigor is the leading advantage he finds 

 in crossed plants. (Cross and Self-fertilization, Chap. IX, p. 327.) 



It is not my object now to controvert the views of Mr. Darwin, or 

 or of his numerous followers. My view of one object of nature in 

 cross fertilization is to aid in production of variety, . I have shown 

 ever since discussion grew warm on these subjects, that variation is 

 essential to the ]»resent order of things, — that nature, to be consistent 

 with herself, must provide for variations if for no other purpose than 

 to make variety. I now propose to show by some studies in 




278 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



Hydrangea, that the variations in the species are of the most con- 

 tradictory character taken from the stand-point of benefits in the 

 struggle for life; while they are entirely consistent with my view of 

 variation for variety's sake. Our garden Hydrangea from Japan, 

 Hydrangea hortensis^ has the ray florets sterile, or rather it is the 

 lateral florets of the compound cyme, that give the enlarged sepals, 

 and fail to perfect the gynrecium. The terminal florets are fertile. 

 In H. quercifolia, all tlie lateral florets are fertile, and it is only the 

 terminal one that has petaloid sepals and is barren. Will any one 

 assert that these exactly opposite conditions can have any bear- 

 ing whatever as aids in a struggle for life? Suppose we say that the 

 attractive sepals are given to these species for the purpose of attract- 

 ing insects, and thus aiding cross-fertilization. With this view we 

 examine the American species H. arborescens, and we find barely 

 an attempt to make these enlarged petaloid sepals. There are 

 small ones on a few terminals and this is all. It has made out 

 certainly as well in the great struggle as either of its two brethren.- 

 But is it a fact that the showy sepals are given to the plant to attract 

 insects? There is neither pollen nor nectar in tlie male flowers of 

 H hortensis. They conceal the terminal hermaphrodites, and it is 

 scarcely probable many insects, if any, visit the flowers. In the 

 other two, many ins^jcts visit the flowers-so far as my observations 

 go, as many visit the H. arborescens without the attractive sepals, as 

 the H. qiiercifoUa that makes such a show of them. 



Turning to the minute fertile flowers on these two species, we are 

 struck by the immense number of stamens and the enormous num- 

 ber of })ollen grains one of these racemose cymes gives us. I estimat- 

 ed the number of stamens on one of H. qaerciJoHa at 13,000 ; shaken 

 over a slieet of dark paper it completely whitens it. It can be carried 

 by the wind everywhere, why should it develop pelatoid sepals to at- 

 tract insects? Both species have the'odor of Hawthorn, but in addi- 

 tion H. quercifolia has an enormous yield of nectar, which is apparent- 

 ly not abundant in H. arborescens. In spite of all the attractions, the 

 petaloid sepals, the abundance of pollen, the delightful fragrance, 

 the super-abundance of nectar, and the actual visits of numerous 

 insects, the flowers are self-fertilizing. The outer row of five stamens 

 mature pollen simullaneously with the expansion of the petals, which 

 falls at once on the receptive stigmtis, some hours after the inner

series mature, and ensures that self-fertilization which the pollen 

 from the first series may possibly have missed. Tlie only possible 

 aid insects c;an give is in self-fertilization. 



It is broadly asserted that we owe to the existence of insects the 

 various forms and colors of flowers with their grateful odors and 

 sweet secretions. Here we have illustrations of the most dissimilar 

 and contradictory variations in a single genus, variations which 

 cover all the leading points called for by the insect-adaptationists, 

 and so far as any argument in common use goes, could have occurred 

 with as much reason if not a single insect ever existed. The facts 

 are absolutely inexplicable on any theory of the survival of the 

 fittest in the struggle for life, — but on my view of the absolute 

 necessity of variation for its own sake, the explanation seems simple 

 enough. 



Variation is iuseparable from even the closest in-and-in 

 breeding. We are as fully justified in saying that nature abhors a 

 perpetuity of form as that she abhors in-and-in breeding, and we 

 can just as earnestly claim cross-fertilization as an agent in bringing 

 about variation for the sake of variety, as for the reasons usually 

 given, and which we find we cannot apply with consistency in so 

 many cases. 



That cross-fertilization aido variation, we may well believe is a 

 sufficient reason for its existence, — without assuming that it has 

 no other office to perform. 



Oil the forms of Lomcera Japoiuca; with notes o)i the origin of the 

 forms. — The well-known honeysuckle of our gardens, Lonicera Ja- 

 ponica Thunberg, gives three forms of this in general cultivation, 

 supposed to be distinct species. One, known as L. Halleana, intro- 

 duced into America about a quarter of a century ago, I take to be 

 the plant so intended by the author of the original name. It is the 

 plant figured in Botanical Register, plate 70. Another isZ. brachy- 

 botri/a Asa Gray, a well-known form, preferring to creep and root 

 in the ground, to climbing. The third ha^ been long in cultivation 

 as " Chinese woodbine," a favorite for its rosy, sweet flowers, and is 

 the L.fiexuosQi of Loddiges. All the characters given by the authors 

 of the several names, can be found in diflferent stages and conditions 

 of the same plant. The segments of the corolla in L. flexuosa are 

 somewhat narrower than in the other two; and it has a rosy pur- 

 ple tint in the stems, leaves and flowers. The leaves in L. brachy. 

 botrya are shining, and the hair, being a little shorter, makes the

plant seem different. Tlie flowers in all three turn yellow soon after- 

 they open. 



On account of this change, the plant is known as "Silver and 

 Gold " in Japan. 



The flowers open towards evening. At the expansion of the co- 

 rolla, the stamens and pistil are of equal length. The flower is pro- 

 terogynous. In the morning the stigmas will adhere, if brought 

 together by their viscid secretions; but the anthers do not disperse- 

 pollen till later. The expanded flower remains white or rosy-tinted 

 all the day after opening, and turns yellow the second day, fading 

 the third. The tube of the corolla is about an inch long. On the 

 evening of expansion it contains no honeyed secretion. In the 

 morning the production of nectar is coeval with the bursting of the 

 anther cells, by noon the sweet liquid has risen up the tube for about 

 one-third its length. It continues to flow after the change to yellow; 

 and by evening, the tube is full for half its length, or half an inch. 

 When the flower wholly fades, the sweet secretion, which gives the 

 name of honeysuckle to the family is .still there. Amid all these points 

 of uniformity, there are differences in productiveness. The form 

 known asTy. brachybotrya is abundantly fertile; in occasional in- 

 stances only do the others bear fruit. This is worth noting. Plants 

 twining on trellises, under exactly the same conditions, vary re- 

 markably in their reproductive powers. Such observations have 

 been made before on other ])lants, and are the facts regarded as jniz- 

 zling. Mr. Darwin says: — " They make me believe that some indi- 

 viduals of a species differ from others in their sexual affinities (to 

 use the term employed by (raertner) like closely allied species of 

 the same genus." (Cross and Se(f-fertiiization, Chap, vi, p. 209.) 



As the expression "sexual affinity" docs not explain anything, 

 and as these three honeysuckles are such very distinct individuals 

 as to have been regarded as distinct "species of the same genus, they 

 suggested themselves as offering excellent opportunities for observa- 

 tion as to the influence of anything that could be understood as being 

 in the nature of environment that might account for the origin of their 

 several forms; and especially what part the visits of insects might have 

 had in developing the general form of the whole flower. In the hon- 

 eysuckle, the tube of the flower attracts ])rominent attention. The 

 lai'ge amount of nectar it contains, gives the name of honeysuckle to 

 the family as already noted, and one cannot help refer)'ing to the ac- 

 cepted explanation of the origin of tubular forms. "It may be 




1888.] NATUEAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 281 



admitted as almost certain that some structures, such as .... a long- 

 tubular corolla have been developed in order that certain kinds of 

 insects alone should obtain the nectar." {Cross-and Self-fertiliza- 

 tion, Chap. X, p. 382.) The honey-bee visits all these forms fi-eely. 

 The honey nearly fills the tube, and bees have no difficulty in col- 

 lecting freely. It can scarcely be believed that the plant made an 

 eifort to exclude short tongued visitors, and that the long tube was 

 the result of that effort, and then secreted so much nectar as to 

 nearly fill the tube by Avhich the short tongued insects could get as 

 much as before the effort was made. 



Nor must we lose sight of the supposed objects for which insect 

 visitors are to be encouraged, namely, cross-fertilization. 



In order to make no mistake in our conclusions, it is proper to 

 note here, that modern literature has misconceived the whole idea of 

 cross- fertilization. There cannot possibly be any physiological bene- 

 fit from one flower crossing anuther on the same plant; but this is 

 about all that is involved in much that is written in connection 

 with the visits of insects. Yet Darwin takes especial pains to ex- 

 plain that this is not cross-fertilization. He says : " cross fertiliza- 

 tion always means a cross between distinct plants raised from seeds" 

 (p. 10). Even distinct plants, unless under distinct conditions 

 scarcely constitute crossings in his mind. "The mere act of crossing 

 two distinct plants, whicli are in some degree inter-related, and 

 which have long been subject to the same conditions does little good" 

 (}). 61). Referring to Compositte (p. 173) he notes that the florets 

 were " self-fertilized " though with different florets from the same 

 head. On p. 345 he declares " pollen from the same plant is equally 

 injurious or nearly so, as from the same flowers." And, after all, it is 

 difficult to tell wliat ^Lr. Darwin really means by " injurious," for 

 the most of his experiments, Avhen in his mind resulting beneficially, 

 referred to vegetative luxuriance, in many little related to those^ 

 greater vital questions on which the good of the race depends. He 

 distinctly states (p. 327) " there is therefore, no evidence at present, 

 tliat the fertility of plants goes on diminishing in successive self- 

 fertilized generations, although, there is some rather weak evidence 

 that this does occur with respect to height and growth." Still 

 it is clearly his idea, and evidently the proper one, that the cross- 

 fertilization can only be fiiirly entertained when the physi- 

 ological conditions vary in the individuals crossed. Though the^ 

 lioneysuckles referred to are all from cuttings from the one in- 




"282 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



dividual in each case introduced, yet being three distinct ones from 

 seed originally, there might be a chance for cross-fertilization when 

 three kinds grew altogether, as in those under my observation. 



But I found that the bees, and other short-tongued visiting in- 

 sects, could not, in any way, aid in fertilizing the flower, when gath- 

 ering nectai*. In these forms, the stamens and pistil are curved 

 upward, so that anthers and stigma are far above the lower lip, on 

 which the insect alights. If any insects aid in cross-fertilization, it 

 must be the pollen-gathering bees, and others ; but this will render 

 the speculation in connection with the development of nectar, and 

 the prolongation of the tube in favor of certain classes, of no value, 

 especially in connection with the fact noted, that the short-tongued 

 insects can get the liquid in spite of the prolonged tube. 



It is usual, when similar instances in oflier plants have been noted, 

 to weaken the force of the lessons they teach, by objecting, that 

 many things " may have happened." In this case, it would be 

 urged, that there might be some insects in the native country of 

 these honeysuckles, that we have not here where the ])lant is intro- 

 duced ; but this would not change the fiict, that whatever they may 

 be, they would still be divided into long-tongued and sliort-tongued 

 classes ; and that some bees gather honey only, while others are de- 

 voted to collecting pollen; nor would it ignore the fact that the sta- 

 mens and style are out of the reach of the short-tongued class. It 

 ~" may be" also urged that after the tube had been lengthened to ex- 

 clude the shori-tongued insect, the plant had subsequently, under 

 excessive excitation from the long-tongued visitors, overdone its 

 work, and supplied more nectar than it had originally given ; and 

 then, among the " may he's " often indulged in, is that of a " con- 

 tinuation of effort after the reasons therefor have ceased to exist," 

 and the " progress of development towards a new stage of self-inter- 

 •est." 



No one could rationally deny that in the functions of plants, 

 self-interest largely enters. Nor can it be successfully controverted 

 that flower are often wholly dependent on in.sects for their fertiliza- 

 tion. The point I have for some years contended for is, that we 

 need not necessarily be forced to assume that every variation in a 

 plant, or every function in its life-work, is for its special interest. 

 It seems to me absolutely essential to the present order of things, 

 that variety, for mere varieties' sake, should exist quite independently 

 .of any other consideration. This may involve the necessity of chang- 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 283 



ing the term "adaptation " to "design " in many cases. At any rate, 

 I am unable to see a reason for the special form and arrangement 

 of parts in the honeysuckle flower, that will accord with prevalent 

 speculations, and am constrained to to believe the plant has been 

 forced to assume them for variety's sake.

ON THE HELICOID LAND MOLLUSCS OF BERMUDA. 

 BY H. A. PILSBRY. 



Tluougli the courtesy of Professor Angelo Heilpriu I have beeu 

 enabled to study the Bermudan land shells, collected by the party 

 conducted by him during the past summer. Among them were ex- 

 amples of all the Helicoid species which have been reported by pre- 

 vious observers from the island, some containing the living animal. 

 The species, with the exception of a number of artificially intro- 

 duced European shells, are mostly forms well-known from various 

 W^st Indian localities ; such as Helix cereolas var. mierodonta Desh., 

 H. vortex Pfr. and others ; but besides these, there are a number of 

 shells ])eculiar to Bermuda ; and these last have furnished material 

 for the following notes. 



The helicoid species confined to Bermuda are as follows : H. ber- 

 mudensis Pfr., H. nehoiii Bid., H. reiniana Pfr., H. circanifinnata 

 Redf., H. discrepans Pfr. As to the systematic position of these 

 forms there has been considerable difference of opinion among au- 

 thors ; the first, H. bennudensis, has been ])laced in Caracolus hy 

 Von Martens, in Ht/alina by Clessin. in Zonites by Bland ; H. rein- 

 iana has been considered a Patula by Pfeiffer, Clessin, Tryon and 

 Fischer ; and H. circumfinnatu and discrepans have been placed in 

 Microphjsa by Von Martens and Binney, in Hyalosurjda by Cles- 

 sin, Trvon and others. 



Thus it will be seen that these sj)ecies hav'e been distributed into 

 •several genera in two distinct families. Upon examining the soft 

 parts, however, I find that all have essentially the same organization 

 and without doubt belong to the same genus. 



Dr. O. Boettger proposed in 1884, for the Lower Miocene fossil 

 Helix iiiibricata Braun, and the H. bermudensis Pfr. the name of 

 Poccilozonites. He gave no diagnosis of the new group, but assigned 

 it a position between the typical pahearctic Zonites and the American 

 groups Zon.yalina and Moreletia, a position which the anatomical 

 characters prove to be erronecnis.^

By error, the genus Avas quoted " Poecilozonites Sandberger," in 

 the Zoological Record for 1<S<S4, and this error was repeated by 

 Tryon^ Avho gives the first diagnosis of the group published, giving 

 H. hermudensu as the type and only species. We may, then, con- 

 sider the H. bermadensis Pfr., the type species of the genus. AVheth- 

 er the H. hnhricata Braun be associated Avith the Bernuidan shells 

 or not is a point still to be settled. The superficial resemblance is 

 marked; but as the history of the species of Pceci7o2;o?it^es teaches us, 

 " systematizing " helicoid land mollusks by the shells alone is the 

 merest guess-AVork. 



The fact that the fossil species Avhich Dr. Boettger proposes to 

 unite Avith the Bernuidan form is from the LoAver Miocene forma- 

 tion of Germany, is in itself no great objection to the view that they 

 are congeneric ; for no fact is better established in malaco-geogra- 

 phy than the close affinity existing betAveen the European Tertiary 

 land mollusca and those noAv inhabiting the West Indies.'* To ex- 

 plain this relationship existing betAveen tAvo regions separated by the 

 whole expanse of the Atlantic, various theories have been offered. 

 One of the most plausible is that Avhich bridges the Atlantic by an 

 ancient (Eocene, Early and ]\Iiddle Miocene) continent — nn Atlantis.

 irnbricata zu errichten sein, fiir welche ich den Namen Poecilozonites vorschlage, 

 und die ich am Uebsten zwischen die achten palaarktischen Zonites und die trop- 

 isch-amerikanischen Gruppen Morelelia und Zonyalina vorlaufig als section in der 

 Gattung Zonites Montf. einreihen mochte, bis die Anatomic der lebenden Art eine

2 This affinity although doubtless very great, has been considerably exaggerat- 

 ed. There is, for instance, no warrant for referring European tertiary species to the 

 exclusively New World genera Pleurocera, Anctdosa, Tulotoma, Mesodon, Carini- 

 fex, Melantho, and others. There seems to have been no infusion of European 



Tertiary types into the North American snail fauna east of the Califoi nian region- 

 This fauna is truly autochthonous. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 28T 



This view has been advocated by the well-known conchologist Dr. 

 W. Kobelt' and by others. 



But although this theory explains many anomalies in the distribu- 

 tion of molluscs, I must freely confess that the objections to it seem 

 to me almost insurmountable. The recent woi'k of the Challenger, 

 Blake, and other deep-sea explorations, all tend to confirm the view 

 held by Guyot, Dana, Agassiz and others, that the great oceanic 

 basins, practically as they exist to-day, are of great antiquity ; and 

 render the existence of a former Atlantic continent with any con- 

 siderable Western extension, highly improbable. 



A view more in accordance with the facts with which we ai*e at 

 present acquainted, seems to me to be the following: It is a well 

 ascertained truth that until toward the close of the ]\Iiocene, large 

 portions of Nothern Africa as well as Europe were submerged ; and 

 it appears probable that the westward flowing Equatorial current of 

 the Indian Ocean extended across northern Africa, and united with 

 the Atlantic northern equatorial current, which now flows westward 

 from northern Africa, through the Antilles into the Gulf of Mexico. 

 This current would afford a means of transport not only for the free 

 swimming embryos of marine molluscs, (and there are not a few 

 forms both of gasteropods and pelecypods, common to the Mediter- 

 ranean and Gulf Provinces,) but also, through the agency of floating 

 materials, trees, etc., swept from rivers, land mollusks may have 

 been transported across the Atlantic, just as they have been carried 

 by the Gulf Stream from the West Indies to the outlying island of 

 Bernuula," a distance of over 700 miles. 



A further development of the same idea explains certain peculiari- 

 ties in tlie distribution of species common to the Pacific and the 

 Gulf of jMexico. The presence of Miocene and Pliocene deposits 

 render it certain that there was communication between the Gulf 

 and the Pacific across the isthmus of Panama as late as the Pliocene. 

 And a portion of the equatorial current probably swept directly 

 thi'ough to the Pacific. Thus it is likely that those forms common 

 to both sides of the isthmus, will prove to be of Atlantic origin, and 

 to have been distributed westward. 



The indigenous Bermudan mollusc-fauna, marine as well as terres- 

 trial, has undoubtedly been derived wholly from the West Indies.

And since the island is typically oceanic, "a solitary peak rising 

 abruptly from a base only 120 miles in diameter" surrounded on all 

 sides by between 2500 and oOOO fathoms depth, we have an indica- 

 tion here that land mollusks of many families, Helicidce, Zonifida:, 

 Suceinidce, Pupidcc, HelicinUke, even Vag'uial'uUe, (for a large undes- 

 cribed species of Vaglnulus exists upon the island") may be trans- 

 poi'ted very great distances by sea, by. in all probability, the agencies 

 mentioned above. 



The considerable divergence existing between the various species 

 of the Zouitoid genus peculiar to Bermuda, Poeci/ozonites, indicates 

 that the island is of considerable antiquity. 



"We may define the genus as follows: 



POECILOZONITES. 



Generic characters: fShcll liclicoid, subtrochiforjn, depressed conic, 

 or subdiscoidal, perforate or umbilicate, obliquely striate, ornament- 

 ed with radiating zigzag flammules or spiral bands of chestnut color 

 on a lighter ground ; whorls numerous (7-10) very slowly widening ; 

 body whorl more or less flattened or compressed below the usually 

 carinate i)eriphcry, not descending anteriorly; aperture more or 

 less irregularly lunate ; peristome simple, the columellar margin 

 slightly expanded and thick(Micd with a white callus which encircles 

 the pillar within. Animal simih\r in form to Helix; foot narrow, 

 short ])osteriorly, scarcely reaching behind the shell, without longi- 

 tudinal furrows above its margin or caudal nmcous pore; orifice of 

 genitalia on the right side of neck, near, but not under the mantle; 

 mantle margin simple ; jaw like tluit of Lima.v, very thin, arcuate, 

 with a broad blunt median projection anteriorly ; radula with 

 tricuspid central teeth having quadrate basal plates, the central 

 cusps projecting beyond the anterior margins of the basal plates, the 

 side cusps rather short, with well reflexed cutting points ; lateral 

 teeth similar but asymmetrical, lacking the inner cusps ; marginal 

 teeth aculeate, with simpie thorn-shaped cusps and oval basal plates. 



It will be seen by the above definition that the genus cannot be 

 included in any of the groups with which its species have been 

 associated by authors ; the Zonitoid dentition at once removing it 

 from the Helicidce, and the absence of a caudal mucous pore, the 

 more anterior position of the orifice of the genitalia and the coloration 

 of the shell, separating it from Zonite^ and its subgenera. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 289 



The relationship of the species of Poeeilozonifes to one another is 

 shown by the similarity of the radulne and jaws, and of the external 

 characters of the animal; and in the shells, which at first glance 

 seem to be a heterogeneous assemblage, by the callus which coats 

 the columella, the compression of the whorl below the periphery, and 

 especially by the color-pattern, which is the same in all the species, 

 consisting of zigzag flammules radiating from the sutures. In P. 

 hermudensis the flammules coalesce into continuous bands above and 

 below the periphery in the adult ; but an examination of young 

 specimens reveals the same pattern that is found in P. cireumfirmata, 

 P. reiniana, etc. The internal spiral lamella of P. cireumfirmata 

 w^ould incline one at first to separate it from the other species ; but it 

 is scarcely of generic importance, in view of the fact that in all other 

 characters the species is very similar to P. hermudensis, etc. 



The following analysis shows the inter-relations of the various 

 species : 



A. Base of shell with a revolving lamina within 



cireiimfirmatus, discrepans. 



B. Base of shell without lamina. 



a. Aperture rounded below ; umbilicus wide reinianus. 



h. Aperture angulate below ; umbilicus narrow 



hermudensis, nehoni. 

 Poecilozonites bermudensis PtV. (pi. xvii, flgs. e. c.) 



The typical species is a form of about twenty-five mill, diameter, 

 solid, coarsely irregularly striate and acutely carinate at the per- 

 iphery ; a broad chestnut band usually encircles the shell above 

 the periphery, and another below it ; but these are sometimes 

 absent ; the inner whorls of the spire usually retain traces of the 

 original color-i^attern of radiating flames, and the base in young 

 examples, is radiately streaked (pi. xvii, fig. e). The base is con- 

 vex, and not indented around the nai*row and deep umbilicus, but 

 is angulated at its margin ; the parietal wall is generally covered 

 by a shining white layer with which the interior of the shell is lined. 

 Reeve, Try on and other authors have figured the shell of this 

 species. 



The jaw is like that of P. cireumfirmata. 



The radula (pi. xvii, fig. c) is rather long. The central teeth have 

 basal plates almost as broad as long, the median cusps projecting 

 below their lower margins, with well-developed cutting points, the 

 side cusps short, attaining about the middle of the basal plate, and 



20 




290 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



directed outward ; the lateral teeth are similar, but lack iiiuer cusps ; 

 they are about eight in number, and are followed by about four 

 transition teeth ; the marginals number about fifty on either side, and 

 their cusps become more slender toward the outer edge, and the basal 

 plates shorter. A central with five adjacent lateral teeth, and a 

 group of transition teeth with a true marginal tooth are shown in the 

 figure. 



Helix albella of Chemnitz, (not of Linnaeus), and H. ochroleuca of 

 Pfeitfer, (not Ferussac) are, I believe, synonymous with this S2)ecies. 

 The former is placed in Eurycratera in Pfeiffer's Nomenelator, and 

 the latter has been compared to Pachxjstyla rufozonata, a form some- 

 what similar in characters of the shell, but belonging, of course, to a 

 distinct group. 

 Poecilozonites nelsuni Bland, (pi. xvii, figs, j, k, l). 



A fossil form, diifering from bermudensis in the much greater size, 

 greater number of whorls, more convex base, coarser striation, im- 

 pressed sutures, and especially in the i^eculiarly prominent dome- 

 shaped upper whorls. These are, indeed, so closely coiled as to 

 resemble a specimen of P. circumfirmata. The coloration, imperfect- 

 ly shown in several specimens before me, is that of bermudensis; 

 and whilst its affinities are with the latter species, I regard it as a 

 divergent l)ranch, rather than as an ancestor of that form. 



As has been observed in other cases of species approaching extinc- 

 tion, and probal)ly subject to some decided and unfavorable change 

 in environment, (in this case, })erhaps, due to tlie comparatively 

 recent subsidence and partial submergence of the island') the shell 

 exhibits great mutations and distortions of form ; sometimes the spire 

 is elevated conical, sometimes much de])ressed ; frequently the planes 

 of the upper and lower volutions are not parallel, and the spire con- 

 sequently is canted to one side. The species is remarkably large, 

 solid and roughly sculptured for a Zonitoid. 

 Poecilozonites reinianus PIV. (pi. xvii, figs. i). 



This heretofore unfigured species is discoidal in form, widely 

 umbilicate, the umbilicus about one-third the diameter of the base, 

 exhibiting all the whorls ; the apical whorl is smooth and whitish ; 

 the following whorls are quite convex, with deep sutures, brownish, 

 very prettily zigzagly flammulate with chestnut color, like many of 

 the species of Patula. The body-whorl in adult examples is round- 

 1 See Challenger Report, Narrative, vol. i, p. 138. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 291 



ed ; the base concave around the umbilicus, and the general asjject 

 that of Patula. 



The jaw is like that of circumfirmata. 



The radula (pi. xvii, fig. d) is similar to that of bermudensis except 

 in the following ])oints : the cusps are larger, with much more widely 

 I'e flexed cutting points; the perfect lateral teeth are seven on either 

 side ; the change to marginals is quite abrupt, as there are but two 

 real transition teeth ; the marginals number about sixteen on each 

 side, the inner six or seven of about equal size, the outer ones rapidly 

 ■decreasing toward the edge. The basal plates are longer than in the 

 other species. A central tooth with two adjacent laterals and one 

 marginal ai'e shown in the figure. 



Poecilozonites circumfirmatus Redfieltl. (pi. xvii, figs. f). 



A form with much the appearance of Hyalosagda, a group with 

 which it has been classed by some authors. It is a delicate subtranslu- 

 cent yellowish brown shell, marked with brown streaks, spots and 

 flamraules ; the whorls are separated by moderately impressed sut- 

 ures; the apex is like that of reiniana ; the last whorl is more or less 

 angulate around the periphery, rather flattened below the angle, then 

 convex, indented around the narrow deeply perforating umbilicus ; 

 there is a white calcareous deposit around the columella, inside, as 

 in the other species, and an acute white lamella which revolves 

 within the base near to the periphery, a character which none of the 

 preceding species possess. The variation in form is very great — spec- 

 imens more elevated than my figure f being not infrequent, and 

 these are connected by examples more and more depressed (fig. g) 

 with the flattened lenticular form called by Pfeiffer H. discrej^ans. 

 This extremely depressed variety, now figured for the first time, (PI. 

 xvii, fig. H.) cannot be considered' sj^ecifically distinct from the P. 

 circumfirmata. 



Jaw (pi xvii, fig. b) transparent, very thin, arcuate, with blunt 

 extremities and a wide obtuse median projection below. 



Radula (pi. xvii, fig. a) as described for P. bermudenns, but with 

 only seven laterals, two or-three transition teeth, and about twenty- 

 eight marginals. The marginals have longer basal plates than in P. 

 bermudensis.

ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS UPON THE STRUCTURE AND CLASSI- 

 FICATION' OF THE MESOZOIC MAMMALIA.

In connectiua with a visit to the recent Geological Congress in 

 London the writer reviewed the British ]Musenni collection of !Meso- 

 zoic Mammals which formed the principal basis of a recently pub- 

 lished Memoir' and examined also the valuable specimens at Oxford, 

 Bath and York which had jn-eviously been studied merely from 

 the descriptions and figures of Professor Owen and otliers. Also 

 the Neoplagiaulax specimens in the collection of Dr. Lemoine at 

 Rheims. There are two undescribed specimens in the Oxford ^Museum 

 and since the writer worked upon the collection in the British 

 Museum, (in 1886), many of the Purbeck fossils have been much 

 more fully exposed by the further removal of the matrix. Im})or- 

 tant features have been brought to light, not visible previously, 

 which lead to a revision of some of the conclusions which were 

 reached upon the evidence then at hand. Greater familiarity with 

 the minute Mesozoic types of molars shai'pens the powers of obser- 

 vation and one is more apt to discover new points when on the 

 lookout for them. Thus many inconspicuous but important features 

 were noticed which formerly escaped attention. Some of these, such 

 for example as the identity of Aviblotherium and Stylodon, had been 

 already, anticipated, but others, such as the tritubercular moh\rs 

 oi Amphithermm were entirely unexpected. 



The following notes are in abstract from a Postscript to the jNIemoir, 

 which is in preparation, and are not to be considered as final. 



AMPHIi,ESTES. 



Besides Professor Owen's type, which is preserved in the York 

 Museum,- there are tw'O specimens belonging to this genus at Oxford. 

 In the type, it is somewhat difficult to determine the number of the 

 teeth, as described by Owen, since the incisor and canine alveoli are 

 indistinct, but the Oxford specimens show that there were but six 

 molars instead of seven as conjectured in Lydekker's Catalogue, 

 Part V, p. 271, and adopted by myself, (op. cit., p. 103). In fact, 

 one Avell preserved specimen, a right ramus seen upon the outer 

 surface, shows but five molars. If this specimen be adult, as seems 

 improbable, it may represent a new genus transitional betAveen

Amphilestes with six molars and Triconodon with four. The second 

 specimen, a left ramus also seen upon the outer surface, has three 

 premolars m situ and the space for a fourth, ( pm^ ) ; in front of 

 this is a deeper alveolus, probably for the canine, preceded by the 

 alveoli of at least three incisors, so that the lower dental formula 

 may now be given with considerable certainty as follows: 



i- f-i, Ci, ih, Vh. 



Tlie canine is not preserved. The premolars as viewed upon the 

 outer surftice have prominent cingules but not the true basal cusps 

 seen in Triconodon. The outer face of the molars is entirely devoid 

 of a cingulum. Kone of the specimens give any evidence that the 

 angle is distinct, but indicate that the lower border rises to the level 

 of the condyle precisely as in PhascoJ other ium, Spalacotherium and 

 Triconodon. This strengthens the writer's reference of these genera 

 to one family as opposed to the views of jNIarsh and Lydekker; never- 

 theless, as shown below, Spalacotherium is a more specialized type 

 than the others. 



PHASCOLOTHERIUM. 



Besides the type in the British Museum there is a beautifully 

 preserved specimen belonging to this genus in the Oxford ^luseum 

 and through the kindness of jNIr. James Parker of Oxford the writer 

 had an opportunity of examining a third specimen in his private 

 collection. The latter, which has been figured in Phillips' "Geology 

 of Oxford," is remarkable for the extension of the coronoid beyond 

 the vertical line of the condyle. The Oxford jNIuseum specimen^ 

 contains only the four posterior molars, probably vii — m- with the 

 fangs of m.2 and hi a- It may however be readily distinguished from 

 the Amphilestes specimens b_v the stout cones and by the fact that 

 the internal cingulum rises in two points upon the inner faces of 

 the molars instead of in a single point beneath the protocoue; also 

 by the stout character of the jaw. 



A renewed study of the molar teeth in the ty])e specimen shows 

 tliat all the post-canine teeth jjresent the characters of molars in 

 some respects. T\\q first tooth behind the canine has a main cusp 

 like that of the posterior molars and an internal cingulum horizontal 

 and rising in two points instead of showing the sweep downwards and 

 backwards which is so characteristic of premolar cingula. The 

 accessory cusps are either covered with matrix or broken off. The 

 second tooth has a fractured cingulum so that one cannot determine 



1 The cast of this specimen in the Natural History Museum (m. 2300) has been 

 mistakenly referred to Amphilestes by Lydekker, op. cit., p. 272, on the ground of 

 ■"the small development of the accessory fore-and-aft cusps." The basal cusps of 

 the molars are quite as prominent as in the type. 




294 PROCEEDIXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888.. 



whether the anterior cusp is u cingnle or a true paracoue. The 

 posterior cusp or metacone is prominent and distinct as in the pre- 

 molars of Triconodon. The chief interest lies in the main cusp wliich 

 is loftier and more pointed than the protocone of the third tooth 

 which in turn has all the characteristics of a molar. This is an 

 important point which has been overlooked pi^eviously, since it ap- 

 pears to indicate an available line of division in the functional 

 adaptation of the series, i. e. a line between premolar and molariform 

 teeth. If such a division be confirmed by further examination of the 

 first and second teeth, it will lessen the gap between Amphllestes and 

 this genus and remove what has been considered an entirely excep- 

 tional feature, viz. a type with no preniolariform teeth. The mandib- 

 ular formula may then be provisionally writ-ten thus : it, Cj, jh, 



?»5. 



The crowns of this front pair of teeth have never been correctly 

 represented. The writer's figure (op. cit., PI. 8, fig. 3) is incorrect 

 in restoring the cingulum of the second tooth and the basal cusps 

 of the first tooth. In this Buckland's figure was followed, believing 

 it probable that the jaw was in better condition when he figured it 

 than now, for the last molar was then present. Another error in 

 the drawing is the high position of the dental foramen, to which 

 Professor Marsh kindly directed attention. 



AMPHITYLUS.i 

 In the type of this genus at Oxford tiie teeth arc so fractured that 

 it is impossible to form any idea of their full structure. There is 

 some doubt whether the dental formula, /<, c,, ^4, m-, as gener- 

 ally given, is correct; one cannot be positive, for the 4th and 5th post- 

 canine teeth are much mutilated ; the characters of the condyle and 

 angle, however, separate this specimen clearly from Amphilestes. 

 At the time this genus was proposed the writer supposed we had in 

 No. 36822 (Brit. Mna. Coll.) a ramus showing the outer face of 

 the Ampliitherium molars, but this proves to have been a mistake. 

 The crowns of the last three molars in Amphitylus show a promi- 

 nent posterior or third cusp, of which there is no evidence upon the 

 molars o? Ampliitherium, as seen upon the inner face. The penulti- 

 mate and ante-penultimate molars also retain this third cusj). The 

 fourth, fifth tvud sixth molars counting from the last, show the trifid 

 division of the crown characteristic of the triconodont type, then 

 follow the two mutilated teeth with bifid crowns which may represent 

 either premolars or molars. Thus the formula may read either

PERAMUS. 



We are fortunately able to greatly increase our knowledge of 

 this genus. Upon uncovering the anterior molars of the type speci- 

 men of Leptodadus, an antero-internal cusj) came into view, leading 

 to the discovery that the latter genus is identical with Peramus, 

 and still more interesting is the fact that the type specimen 



of Spalacotherium mimis, 

 (Owen) presents the much de- 

 sired internal view of the 

 Peramus molars. A third 

 specimen confirms the facts 

 derived from the second and 

 shows that altogether there 

 are six or, possibl}', seven 

 specimens in the British 

 ]Museum collection which 

 should be i-eferred to this 

 3, genus, giving us nearly all 

 the characters of the mandib-

further examination which developed the fiict that all the specimens 

 of the above list agree in the following particulars: 1. In evidence 

 of the presence of three incisors, (No's 47744, 47739, 47743). 2, In 

 evidence, direct and indirect, of the presence of six jyremolariform 

 teeth, (No's 47743, 47739, 47742). 3, In evidence of the pres- 

 ence of but three molariform teeth. 4, In the fact that the mylo- 

 hyoid groove does not terminate at the dental canal but extends 

 back beneath the lower border of the pterygoid fossa, (No's 47751, 

 47754). All the specimens which do not directly bear upon these 

 four features of agreement support them indirectly, or at least pre- 

 sent no negative evidence. 



The formula, jjui^, vis, is very exceptional, and ]Mr. Oldfield 

 Thomas, who kindly examined these specimens and discussed the 

 dentition with the writer, suggested a different division of the series. 

 In No. 47739 the third and fourth jiremolars present lower crowns 

 than the succeeding tooth, fig. 1 b, but this is ap])arently because 

 the tips are not full}^ exposed. And as we have at present no other 

 data than the mere form of the teeth, it seems that we are bound 

 to take the dentition as it stands, exceptional as it is, and divide 

 it provisionally as follows: 



The almost invariable presence of four prem<)lars among the 

 Mesozoic and recent mammals is a very difficult foct to explain. 

 This genus and aj)parently Amphitherium are among the few 

 exceptions. AVh}' was the line drawn exactly to include five teeth 

 behind the incisor series, the first of these developing into a canine? 



In describing Peramus (op. cit., p. 263), the writer questioned the 

 refei'ence of tiie anterior portion of the jaw, (No. 47743) to iton several 

 grounds, but now considers this less doubtful, as the single incisor 

 preserved is very similar to that in No. 47744., and both difterfrom 

 those of Stylodon, the only other type which this specimen resembles. 

 The last premolar has a heel very similar to that of the molars. The 

 molars, fig. 1 a, are very similar to those of some of the eocene Creo- 

 donta, presenting the primitive tiibercidar-sectorial type. Among 

 the Jurassic Mammals, they apparently approach most closely the 

 molars of Amphitherium. 



AMPHITHERITIM. 



A comparison of the three specimens belonging to this genus, two 

 in the Oxford collection, and the one previously studied in the 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 297 



British Museum, has enabled the writer to determine fully the struc- 

 ture of the molars and premolars and to correct a previous error. 



In examining the lirst and second molars of the type specimen 

 under a sti'ong lens, an external cusp was detected directly between 

 the internal pair, a discovery of great interest, since, in connection 

 with the last genus, it adds two important types to the tritubercular 

 series. This external cusp is probably the one referred to by Owen, 

 (op. cit., p. 14) in describing the penultimate molar of the second 

 sTpecmien of Amphitherium} He speaks of the latter tooth as the 

 posterior molar, but one can detect the tips of a molar behind this, 

 just breaking through the jaAv. 



The molar of Amphitherium is thus apparently similar to that of 

 Perainus with the exception that the external cusp, in the type species 

 at least, is less lofty. This observation led to a reexamination of the 

 jaw in the British Museum, No. 36822. This unquestionably belongs 

 to Amphitherium, as previously determined, (Osborn, op. cit., p. 192, 

 fig. 2.; Lydekker, op. cit., p. 374), but presents the inner face of the 

 right ramus instead of the outer face of the left ramus as previously 

 described. This is proved by the double internal cusps, by the cin- 

 guluni upon the premolar, and by the faint mylohyoid groove, near 

 the lower border, which was previously overlooked. The individual 

 is much smaller and younger than the two Oxford types, which are 

 nearly of the same size, and the tips of the para- and metacones are 

 entirely unworn.' 



In the Memoir, the formul'd of A)nphitherium was doubtfully given 

 as pmi, 7»6, (following Lydekker). An examination of the 

 Oxford types shows that Prof. Owen was more nearly correct in 

 putting it, pm^, m^. If we deduct the foremost bifanged tooth 

 which he naturally reckoned with the premolar series, but which is 

 probably the canine, we have e,, pm^, vie- In the second Oxford 

 specimen there are undoubted traces of three premolars in front of 



1 "The posterior moiar shows a middle internal and part of a larger external 

 cusp." This observation shows the keenness of the observer, for the molar referred 

 to is in a very fractured condition. 



- The teeth in the Stonesfield Slate specimens are much more brittle than those 

 in the Purbeck series, but it would 1 e well to run the risk of injuring one of these 

 molars to expose the external cone. 




298 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



the two complete ones. In frout of these, Prof. Owen describes 

 sockets for a bifanged tooth, (the canine), and for four single incisor 

 fangs. 



PERALESTES. 



A reexamination of the superior molars in the type maxilla of 

 this genus reveals an inconspicuous but important feature in the 

 crown which escaped Professor Owen's notice as well as the writer's. 

 That is, the presence of a low transverse crest connecting the antero- 

 internal and antero-external cusps. This puts the functional adapta- 

 tion of the Peralestes molar in a different light from that described 

 in the ^Memoir, since it shows that this molar is subtrenchant. A. 

 close examination of the anterior faces of these crests, moreover, 

 yields some evidences of wear l^y the crown of an inferior molar. 

 These crowns are placed somcAvhat obliquely, but when the jaAV is 

 tilted so that the teeth can be viewed directly upon end, they are 

 seen to have a triangular section, with the base with its lesser cusps 

 directed outwards, and the main cone directed inwards, precisely as 

 in the primitive tritubercular crown. AVhen viewed in this way, 

 this pattern at once suggests that of the Spalacotherium lower molars, 

 which consists of a triangle reversing the above, i. e. with the main 

 cone external and the base internal. JNIr. Lydekker was the first to 

 reach this conclusion as to the probable identity of these two genera 

 but upon different grounds,' and the writer has hitherto held quite 

 an opposite opinion,'-' which is now withdrawn. 



The premolar formula of Peralestes is somewhat uncertain and the 

 molars agree in number and size with those of Spalacotherium. At 

 present, however, the evidence for the union of these genera is hardly 

 sufficient to justify more than the j^lacing of Peralestes in brackets 

 with the above genus. 



STYLACODONTIDAE. 



After all the systematic work which has been done upon the genera 

 embraced in this family, there are none in greater confusion as to no- 



' " The true molars (of Peralestes) agree so closely in structure with those of 

 Ckrysochloris tliat there is every probability that the specimen belongs to Spalaco- 

 therium tricuspiiietis'" op. cit., p. 294 : In the writer's opinion, the molars of Ckrys- 

 ochloris bear only a remote resemblance to those of Spalacotherium.

299- 



As the writer anticipated after examining Prof. Marsh's 

 Dryolestes, (Am. Naturalist, 

 :\Iarch 1888, p. 234 and Mem- 

 oir, p. 236.) the genera Amhlo- 

 therhun and Achyrodon prove 

 upon further examination and 

 exposure of the crowns to be- 

 long to the StylodoH type. 



It further appears that Mr. 

 Lydekker was correct in plac- 

 ing Peraspala.v with Aniblo- 

 thermm (op. cit., p. 275),. 

 although he did not recognize 

 the trituberculate character 

 of the crown with the styloid 

 external cone and two internal 

 cusps and heel. The writer 

 was in error, first in describ- 

 ing the external cusp of the 

 molars of this genus {Peras- 

 pala.v^ as separated by a valley 

 from the internal cusps, for 

 there proves to be a distinct 

 transverse crest ; probal)ly also, second, in associating this jaw with 

 the Feralestes maxilla, (op. cit., p. 233). 



It is now evident that the molars of Professor Owen's types of 

 Atnblotherlum soriciniim (Mes, Mamm., 1871 p. 29) of A. mxistelula 

 (ibid., p. 31.), of Phascolestes longirostris (ibid., p. ^5.), of Achyrodon 

 nanus (ibid., p. 37.), of A. pxisil/us (ibid., p. 39.), of Peraspalax 

 talpoides (ibid., p. 40.), all present substantially the same crowns, 

 (see Fig. 2). It is also probable, but not actually demonsti-atcd, that 

 Sfy/odon pusiUus (Geol. Mag., 1866, p. 199.) and S. robustus (ibid.) 

 have the same molar pattern. Professor ^larsh has further applied a 

 series of genei'ic and specific names to the closely allied American 

 genera. Altogether it will prove a difficult matter to clear up the 

 synonomy of these numerous species and will require a close exam- 

 ination and revision of all the material available. 



It is singular, in view of the probable similarity of many of these 

 species, that all the specimens referred to Stylodon, because exposing 

 the external foce, possess but seven molars, with one possible excep-

tion, while three of the specimens shown upon the inner face have 

 ■eight molars. As derived from a study of Professor IMarsh's collec- 

 tion, the basis of distinction between these genera will depend: 1, 

 upon the number of the teeth in the adult condition; 2, upon the 

 presence of a heel, which is apparently wanting in Asthenodon ; 3, 

 upon the presence of one or of two transverse crests connecting the 

 external with the pair of internal cones. 



The name Stylodon is preoccupied, but Amblotherium has the })re- 

 •cedence of Stylacodon, (Marsh) and A. soriciniim can probably be 

 retained for the larger species with seven molars, thus embracing S. 

 robiistus with which it agrees closely in measurement. Phascolestes 

 would then embrace the species with eight molars. But these ques- 

 tions can only be finally determined by a careful revision of all the 

 material. 



It now seems probable that the type maxilla of Kurtodon (No. 

 47755.) fig. 2 a, should be placed somewhere in this series, as held by 

 Owen and not represent a distinct family as maintained by the writer. 

 Since the original study and figuring of the molars, the matrix has 

 been extensively removed, so that the outer faces of the crowns are 

 exposed and show a low antero-internal cusp near the liase of tlio 

 crown ; this cusp is very important because it is apparently homol- 

 ogous with the postero-internal cusp of the Amblotherium lower molar. 

 Further, as Mr. Lydekker has pointed out (op. cit., p. 291) the 

 block Xo. 47786 {S. pusillusf) contains upper molars of a very 

 similar pattern associated with lower teeth, resembling those of 

 Stylodon. It is freely admitted that the views before expressed by 

 the writer are not sustained by this additional evidence, although as to 

 the more definite-question, it is not as yet evident with which of these 

 jaws the Kurtodon maxilla should be placed. The question will be 

 settled by the exposure and study of the crowns of the numerous 

 specimens referred to Stylodon. The Kurtodon crowns are unlike 

 tliose oi' Amblotherium soricinum or of Achyrodon since the summit 

 is much broader and the wearing surface, instead of being trenchant, 

 is grinding, as previously described, (op. cit., p. 109). 



Summary. 

 The principle features of the jH'esent contribution are the follow- 

 ing: 1, Additional characters of Amphilestes and the probal)le 

 determination of the premolar-molar formula. 2, Additional char- 

 acters of Phascolotherium, suggesting a division between molars and 

 premolars. 3, A review of the J »y>/u7?//tt6- dentition. 4, The union 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 301 



of Leptocladus dubius and Spalacotherium minus with Peramus, and 

 determination of the mandi1)ular dentition of the latter genns. The 

 molars are tritnbercular. 5, The discovery also of apparently tritu- 

 bercnlar molars in A mphitherium and probable determination of the 

 premolar-molar formula, (confirming Owen's views). 6, Confirming 

 Lydekker's suggestion of the probable union ofPeralestes with Spala- 

 cotherium, and of Pera-spalax with Amhiotlierium. 7, The probable 

 union oiPeraspalax, Amhlotherium, Achyrodon, Phascolestes, Stylodon 

 and Kurtodon, into two or three genera with a substantially similar 

 molar structure. 8, The correction of the writer's former vieAvs as 

 to the family separation of the Peralestidce and probably of the 

 Kurtodontidce. 



The genei-al result of the renewed and more extended study of these 

 mammals has thus been, first to reduce the number of genera and 

 eliminate two of the families proposed in the ^Memoir ; second, by the 

 discovery of the molar structure of Amphltheriimi and Peramus, to 

 substantially reduce the number of molar types among the English 

 genera to two, viz. : the triconodont in Amphilestes,Phascolotherium, 

 TriconodoH and probably Amphitylus, and the tritubercidar in all the 

 remaining genera. 



This latter result is of great interest in its bearing upon the theory 

 that the molar teeth of all the mammalia have either passed through 

 the tritubercular stage or have been arrested at one of the steps in. 

 tooth development leading lo tliis stage.

CONIRIBUTIONS TO THE NATURAL HISTORY OF THE 

 BERMUDA ISLANDS. 



BY PROF. ANGELO HEILPRIX. 



The following notes on the zoology of a group of islands but little 

 known to the naturalist are based on personal observations, and on 

 collections made during a brief sojourn on the islands during the 

 past summer, in company with a class of students from the Academy 

 of Natural Sciences. But little systematic work, other than that in 

 the departments of orinthology, ichthyology, and botany, had hith- 

 erto been done in this remarka])ly interesting, and typically oceanic, 

 island grouj), and it was thought that a more critical survey might 

 bring out facts of general interest to the zoological student, and 

 throw some additional light upon the intricate subject of zoogeogra- 

 phy. In the results obtained I have not been disappointed. The 

 exuberance of animal life has yielded much that has proved to be new 

 to the systematist, while certain remarkable peculiarities in the dis- 

 tribution of a num])er of well-known types of animals open up vistas 

 in geographical distribution which appear to me at present to recede 

 into darkness, and, perhaps, tend to draw only more closely the veil 

 over this mysterious sul>ject. 



Much of my time was devoted to an examination of geological 

 features, and, indeed, the special object of the journey was to 

 ascertain, in the light of more recent inquiry, what evidence could 

 be obtained from the Bermudas bearing upon the question of the 

 growth and development of coral islands. The substance of my 

 observations in this field will be presented in a future paper. Only 

 a portion of the zoological results is here published, inasmuch as 

 additional material in ceitain departments, intended to fill in gaps 

 in the inquiry, has been promised by local collectoi's. 



The specimens noted or described in the following pages were 

 mainly obtained through dredgings, which were carried on as well 

 in the outer water as in the smaller interior sounds and lagoons. 

 As might have been anticipated the greatest profusion of animal 

 life was found on the edge of the growing reef itself, the shoals 

 surrounding the cluster of rocks on the northern barrier known as 

 the North Rock. The wealth of forms occurring here almost tran- 

 scends belief; unfortunately, the combination of limited time at our 

 command and the state of the weather prevented more than a cursory

The true stone corals of the Bermudas are comprised, as far as we 

 now know, in some twenty-five species, the greater number of which are 

 represented l)y identical forms in the Bahaman or West Indian seas. 

 The genera thus far indicated are Oculina, Myce'dium, Astrcea, 

 JSiderastrcea, Porites, Isophyllia, 3Iceandrina, and Diploria. The 

 genus Madrepora, one of the commonest of the Bahaman and Flor- 

 idian corals, appears to be absent. On the south and east side of the 

 island group the outer margin of the growing reef, largely coyered 

 by a serpuline and vermetus growth, approaches to within a few 

 hundred feet of the shore, where it breaks the inflowing surf into a 

 white crest. Within the line of these breakers the depth of water is 

 in j)laces as much as ten or twelve fathoms. The brain coral (Diplo- 

 ria) and various gorgoniaus develop here in great profusion, the huge 

 yellow masses of the former api)earing ahiiost everywhere at depths 

 of from ten to twenty feet. Vast growths of millepore also cover the 

 shallower bottoms, presenting in the ensemble a wonderful garden of 

 animal development. This profusion of coral gro\\th is, however, 

 surpassed on the north side, where the reef recedes to a distance of 

 some eight or nine miles from the island- shores, enclosing an exten- 

 sive body of water whose depth is in general about eight or ten fath- 

 oms, and more rarely twelve fathoms. Much the same coral growth 

 is indicated here as on the south side, the large brain corals pre- 

 ponderating by their masses. While, probably, the greatest profusion 

 of animal life is really met with on the actual edge of the growing 

 reef, this does not a})pear to be the case with the corals themselves. 

 At any rate, I was unable to satisfy myself that thei-e was any marked 

 difference to ])e observed between the marginal growth and that which 

 extends gradually backward from the margin into deep water. 

 Indeed, as far as the brain-corals themselves are concerned, it ap- 

 peared to me that their largest masses were to be found some distance 

 within the bounding reef, and consquently beyond the breaking 

 action of the surf. This condition is again shown in the compar- 

 atively quiet and sheltered waters of Castle Harbor, where portions 

 of the platform-bottom may be said to constitute one almost connect-

ed mosaic of huge Diplorias. In so far, therefore, the Bermudas 

 differ from the greater number of coral islands, in which, as is com 

 mouly stated, there is a marked deficiency in the coral growth 

 within the bounding area, and an equally marked luxuriance on the 

 crest and outer slope of the reef. 



In most places the largest corals do not come nearer than a foot or 

 two feet of the surface of the water, the massive brain-corals rarely 

 appearing in water of less depth than five or six feet. But in the 

 shallows off the North Rock we found Porltes astncoides almost 

 at the surfiice in low water, and just off the entrance to Harrington 

 Sound, on the north shore, Siderastrcea galaxea was covered by only 

 about two inches of water. The borders of Harrington Sound are 

 largely overgrown with species oflsophyllla, wliich likewise approach 

 to within a short distance of the surface. In the greater depths of the 

 Sound we found only Oculina, down to ten fathoms, the di'edge-net 

 being frequently caught and reversed by their ramose stems ; beyond 

 ten fathoms the dredge usually came up empty. 



The following species were obtained by us : 



Mycedium fragile, Dana. 



Two specimens. Xorth Rock ? 

 Oculina diffusa, Lauik. 



Harrington Sound. 

 Oculina varicosa, Lesueur. 



Harrington Sound. 

 Oculina pallens, Ehrenberg. 



Harrington Sound. 



I feel satisfied that this species is identical Avitli the preceding, the 

 same stock bearing what might be considered to be typical repre- 

 sentatives of both forms. 



The amount of variation in the disposition of the calyces, as well 

 as in their individual shape, is very great in this genus, and 1 am 

 by no means sure that two or three of the other fdtms of Oculina 

 here enumerated represent anything more than varietal modifi- 

 cations. Pourtales, in his illustrations of the corals of the Florida 

 reefs (Mem. Mus. Comp. Zoology, YII, plates I and II) correctly 

 refers, it seems to me, both types to a single species (A. varicosa.) 



Oculina speciosa. Edwards and Haime. 



Harrington Sound. 

 Oculina recta, Quelch. 



One specimen, from Harrington Sound, which agrees ifl the. special 

 characters of the species from St. Thojiias (Quelch, Challenger 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PfllLADELPHIA. 305 



Reports, Zoology, XVI, p. 51.) The species does not appear to have 

 been hitherto observed in the Bermudian waters. 



Oculina coronalis, Quelch. 



Harrington Sound. First described from the Bermudas (Challen- 

 ger Reports, Zoology, XVI, p. 49.) 



Quelch, in his report on the reef-building corals of the Challenger 

 (op. cit., pp. 9 and 49), enumerates as an additional member of the 

 Bermudian fauna the Oculina Berviudiana of Duchassaing and 

 Michelotti. I have been unable to find anything in the description 

 or figures furnished by these authors (Supplement cm Memoire sur 

 les Coralliaires des Antilleti, p. 162, pi. IX, figs. 1, 2 — Memorie 

 della Recde Accad. Seienze di Torino, Ser. Sec, XXIII, 1866) to 

 distinguish their species from Oculina speciosa, nor does it appear 

 to me to be distinct. The characters upon which the form is sep- 

 arated are exceedingly trivial, and well within the amount of 

 variability which is presented by individual specimens of nearly all 

 the species of Oculina. I further believe that 0. coronalis, and 

 possibly also 0. recta, will have to be united with 0. speciosa. 



Isophyllia australis ? Edwards and Haime. 



Three specimens from the North Rock, doubtfully identified with 

 this species. 



Isophyllia fragilis ? Dana. 



I am uuable to satisfy mjself as to the positive existence of this 

 species in Bermuda, although Quelch refers to a single specimen 

 having been obtained there by the Challenger party. This author- 

 ity doubtfully refers one of the forms figured by Pourtales (pp. cit, 

 pi. VII, fig. 3) as I. dipsacea to Dana's species, but from an 

 examination of a number of Bermudian specimens which agree 

 absolutely with Pourtales's figure I am fairly convinced that this 

 identification is incorrect. The specimens do certainly not agree 

 sufiiciently with Dana's descrij)tion, and if they are not the types of 

 a distinct species, then they represent probably only a certain jjliase 

 of development of /. dipsacea, as in indicated by Pourtales. 

 Isophyllia dipsacea, Dana. 



Three specimens, from Castle Harbor. 



Isophyllia strigosa, Duchas^saing and Michelotti. 



A number of specimens, from Harrington Sound, which agree 

 with the description of this species. I am doubtful as to the species 

 being distinct from Isophyllia dipsacea ; possibly, however, some of 

 21 




306 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



the varieties (so-called) of the latter species figured by Pourtales are 

 really members of this species. Its principal distinguishing char- 

 acters appear to be the thinner and more irregular septa, and the 

 terminal cleft that indents or separates the septa of opposing calyces 

 where they ci'oss the common wall. It also presents a more bristling 

 appearance than I. dipsacea. 



Isophyllia Guadeloupensis, Pourtales. 



One specimen. This appears to be a good species, although by 

 Quelch it is referred lo Isojjhyllia strigosa. 



In addition to these forms Quelch enumerates IsophyUia (Sym- 

 phyllia) margviata, I. cylindriea, and /. Knoxi, all of Duchassaing 

 and Michelotti, as having been obtained at the Bermudas, but I 

 have failed to detect any specimens among our collections which can 

 be confidently referred to these species. On the other hand, I find 

 one or two forms which I have not yet been able to identify with 

 any described forms. 



Siderastrssa galaxea, Ellis and Solander. 



Abundant on the shoals of Gallows Island, near the mouth of 

 Flatts Inlet, where the colonies come to within about two inches of 

 the surface; also on the borders of Harrington Sound. 



Porites clavaria, Lamk. 



Two specimens, dredged in Harrington Sound. 

 Porites astraeoides, Lamk. 



We found this species very abundantly along the outer reef, 

 especially on the flats of the Xorth Rock, whei'e it is the dominant 

 form of coral. The species appears to have been overlooked by the 

 Challenger party, and indeed, the only reference that I have been 

 able to find indicating the occurrence of this common West Indian 

 form among the Bermudas is contained in Mr. Rathbun's list of 

 the species of Porites in the United States National Museum (Proc. 

 IT. S. National Museum, 1887, p. 354). 



Maeandrina labyrinthica, Ellis and Solander. 



Three specimens, from the North Rock. 

 Maeandrina strigosa, Dana. 



This form is represented by large, sub-globose specimens, one of 

 which, obtained through purchase, and probably from Castle 

 Harbor, has an exceedinojly attenuated base of attachment. The 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 307 



corallum is thus openly turbinate, or even pediculate, and exhibits 



in regularly scalariform outline the successive stages of outward 



development. 



Diploria cerebriformis, Lamk. 



This species is exceedingly abundant in the shoals lying to the 

 leeward of the marginal reef, where its huge hemispherical or reni- 

 form masses of bright orange, measuring as much as four or five 

 feet in diameter, can be distinctly seen through the transparent 

 waters at depths of from six to fifteen or twenty feet. I cannot say 

 how much further down the species extends. It is equally abundant 

 in Castle Harbor, where it is largely instrumental in building out 

 the shore-platform which, at a moderate distance from the shore, 

 descends vertically into deeper water. When attached by a con- 

 tracted base, the brain-coral may be readily removed from its moor- 

 ings; but where the base is largely co-extensive with the under-surface 

 of the corallum the difliculties of removal are very great, neces- 

 sitating much undercutting with a chisel. The largest specimen 

 obtained by us measured about 28 inches across ; our efforts to 

 dislodge a -specimen about four feet in diameter proved unsuccessful. 



Diploria Stokesi, Edwards and Haime. 



We obtained a number of specimens of this species in Castle 

 Harbor and through presentation ; for the latter my thanks are due 

 to Miss A. Peniston, of Peuistons. The habitat of the species, as 

 far as I am aware, had not hitherto been noted. Edwards and 

 Haime in their description of the species {Hist. Nat. des Goralliaires, 

 II, p. 403, pi. D, fig. 3) state " Patrie inconnue. " I believe it may 

 be assumed that this species is the form described and figured by 

 Kuorr as Madrepora /abyrinthiforviis (Delidce Naturae Selectee, I, ]). 

 18, PI. A 4, fig. 1). In our collections we have a closely related, 

 and possibly identical species, which assumes a ring form, and in 

 which the peculiar calycular hollows of D. Stokesi run out into 

 parallel transverse grooves on the inner side of the ring. 



ALCYONARIA. 



The gorgonians are abundant in the waters inside of the bounding 

 reef, whence nearly all our specimens were obtained. A few Avere 

 nipped up on the south side of Castle Harbor, and at the passage way 

 conducting from the north into that body of water. 




308 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



Rhipidogorgia flabellum, Valenciennes. 



The purple variety of this species is abundant more particularly 

 in the northern waters, both near the outer reef and on the shallows 

 known as Devonshire Flats. We failed to obtain any of the yellow 

 forms, and I am not positive that this variety has ever been found 

 at the Bermudas. 

 Gorgonia (Plexaura) purpurea Pallas. 

 Gorgonia (Plexaura) flexuosa, Lamouroux. 



This species, of which we obtained several specimens, is, I believe, 

 without doubt the Gorgonia anguieulus of Dana (U. S. Exploring 

 Expedition, Zoophytes, p. (S(S?''). It is referred to under Lamouroux's 

 name as a member of the Bermudian fauna in Dana's " Corals and 

 Coral Islands, " p. 114, 1872. 

 Gorgonia (Plexaura) homomalla, Esper. 

 Gorgonia (Plexaura) multicauda, Lam. 



(^Gorgonia crassa, Ellis and Solander.) 



((?. re?'wiiat/ato, Edwards and Haime.) 



The exact limitations and synonymy of this species are difficult to 

 make out, but as far as my studies have permitted me to analyze 

 the forms above indicated from the rather insufficient or deficient 

 descriptions that have been furnished by their authors, they appear 

 to represent an identical form. As such -as I have accordingly 

 referred them in this list. 



Gorgonia (Plexaura) dichotoma, Esper. 



A single specimen, measuring about a foot and three-quarters in 

 height, witli the main stems somewhat over a half-inch iu diameter. 

 Gorgonia (Eunicea) pseudo-antipatlies. Lam. 



One much branched specimen, and another, slightly differing, 

 which appears to belong to the same species. 

 Pterogorgia acerosa, (?) Pallas. 



A single specimen of a large Pterogorgia, entirely stripped of 

 coenenchyma, and measuring about two and a-half feet in height, 

 was obtained through purchase at the Crawl. The axial skeleton is 

 yellowish, or of the color of earth. The terete branches are much 

 more broadly spreading than in P. setosa, and unite into a common 

 basal stalk which is upwards of two inches in thickness. The pinn- 

 ules are very numerous, exceedingly slender, and pendulous, giving 

 to the whole oi-ganism the decided appearance of a weeping-willow. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 309 



I have not been able to satisfy myself as to the exact affinities of 

 this species. It appears to differ broadly from the common purple 

 sea-feather of the West Indies, and does not have the depressed 

 branches which are assumed for Esper's Pterogorgia acerosa. It is, 

 however, with little doubt one of the forms that are included by 

 Pallas in his Gorgonia acerosa ( Quercus marina Theophrasti), and 

 may be the one that is referred to by Milne-Edwards as Pierogorgia 

 Sloanei. 



Of the species of gorgonians above enumerated Dana indicates 

 Rhipidogorgia flahellum, Gorgonia flexuosa, G. homomalla, and G. 

 crassa as coming from the Bermudas (" Corals and Coral Islands, " 

 p. 114). I find no mention in any more recent work of the occurence 

 there of either Gorgo7iia pseiido-antipathes or G.dichotovia. On the 

 other hand, we failed to obtain the Pterogorgia Americana mention- 

 ed by Dana. 



ZOANTHID^. 



Of the zoanthoid forms of actinians we collected three species, 

 Palythoa {Corticifera) glareola, Lesueur, P. ocellata, Ellis and 

 Solander, and a species of Zoantha, closely related to Z. sociata, but 

 possibly new. The first of these species was found in large encrusting 

 masses at the North Rock, partially exposed at low water. The 

 glary white or yellowish crusts were nearly half an inch in thickness. 

 Palythoa ocellata also occurs, but more sparingly, at the same local- 

 ity ; on the western exposure of Gallows Island, at the entrance to 

 Flatts Inlet, it was much more abundant, forming large patches in 

 association with Siderastrcea galaxea. The species of Zoantha was 

 sparingly developed off Gallows Island, but in one or more rock- 

 liollows in Tucker's Town Bay, Castle Harbor, the bright green 

 colonies of this beautiful polyp were plentiful. 



ECHINODERMATA. 



HOLOTHURIA. 



The animals of this order are in places excessively abundant ; in- 

 deed, excepting the corals, they may be said to constitute the most 

 distinctive feature of the fauna of the sand bottoms. Where other 

 forms are apparently entirely absent, the black masses of the great 

 Stichopus stand out in prominent relief over the white bottom. 

 ]\Iotionless, seemingly, during the greater part of their existence, 

 these singular creatures present the appearance of big lilack blotch- 

 es on the sand, of which they consume, whether for nourishment or 




310 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



otherwise, vast quantities. All the individuals that were opened 

 had their intestinal canal, or more properly, their entire digestive 

 tracts, completely choked with calcareous particles. 



The following are the species of holothurians observed by us, 

 only one of which, I believe, had hitherto been noted from the 

 Bermudas : 



Holothuria Floridana, Pourtales. (Holothuria atra, Jdger.) PI. 14, figs. 6, 6a, 

 7, 7a. 



I identify with this species five small individuals of an olive-green 

 color which were obtained in Castle Harbor, and which in a general 

 way agree with the description of the species given by Pourtales 

 (Proc. American Assoc, 1851, p. 12). Unfortunately, no figure 

 accompanies the description, and that part which pertains to the 

 calcareous bodies embodied in the skin is too vague to permit of spe- 

 cific determination. Selenka (Zeitschrift fur wissenschaftliche Zool- 

 ogie, xvii, p. 324, 1867) has supplemented the original descrijition 

 with further details of structure and with illustrations of the spicules, 

 which practically leave no doubt in my mind that the Bermudian 

 forms, even though differing somewhat from the type described l)y 

 Pourtales, are really that species. I have examined the spicular 

 bodies of all the individuals, and find that they exhibit considerable 

 variation (PI. 14, figs. 6, 6a, 7, 7a). This is especially noticeable in 

 the form of the stools. I really doubt if very much dependence can 

 be placed upon these bodies as furnishing characters for specific 

 distinction. I also find a certain amount of variation in the num- 

 ber of tentacles. Thus, while four of the individuals have the 

 normal number of tentacles, 20, one has only 10, although in all 

 other essentials of structure it agrees Avith the remaining four. The 

 dorsal surface is distinctly papillate. The elongated yellowish pedi- 

 cels of the ventral surface are irregularly distributed, as stated by 

 Selenka, and I could not determine any strictly linear disposition 

 such as in indicated by Pourtales. 



The largest specimen measures about two and a half inches. 



Semper, Ludwig, and Lampert (Die Seeivalzen, Semper's Reisen 

 im Archipel der Philippinen, 1885, p. 86) identify this species with 

 the Holothuria atra of Jiiger (1833), whose range is made to be 

 practically cosmopolitan — extending from the Radack Archipelago 

 and the Sandwich Islands to Adelaide, Zanzibar, the Red Sea, and the 




1888.] XATUPvAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 311 



West Indies — but on this point I can oifer no satisfactory evidence, 

 never having had an opportunity to examine authentic specimens of 

 Jiiger's species. 

 Holothuria captiva, Ludwi-jj. (PI. 14, figs, i, 4a) 



Two individuals, agreeing witli the species described by Ludwig 

 from the Barbados. 



Holothuria abbreviata, n. sp. (PI. 14, figs. 5, 8, Sa.) 



Among the smaller forms of holothurians is one which in many 

 of its characters agrees most closely with Ludwig's H. captiva, but 

 yet differs to such an extent as to compel me to recognize it as a 

 distinct species. Indeed, by many systematists it would pi'obably be 

 made the type of a distinct sub-genus or genus. The distinguishing 

 peculiarity is the abrupt truncation of the body, which carries the 

 vent on the dorsal surface, immediately about the extremital border. 

 In the single specimen before me I could determine only 17 tentacles, 

 with as many tentacular vesicles, and but a single Polian body. A 

 large Cuvierian bundle is present. The pedicels are arranged ven- 

 trally in three more or less distinct rows. Color olive green. 

 Length about two inches. 



The stools, buttons, and fenestrated plates of the pedicels are 

 figured on plate 14. It will be seen that in general they bear a close 

 resemblance to those of Holothuria captiva, hut the rounded sum- 

 mits of the stools serve readily to distinguish them from the some- 

 what similar, but more strictly castellated, bodies of the other spe- 

 cies. 



SEMPERIA^ 

 Semperia Bermudensis, n. sp. (PI. 14, figs. 2, 2a, .3.) 



Body cylindrical, spindle-shaped, tapering almost equally to both 

 extremities. Tentacles 10, of which 4 are shorter than the remain- 

 ing 6 ; pedicels crowded, arranged in five broad rows, and scattered 

 over the interambulacral areas ; two genital bundles, with very 

 numerous non-divided, and greatly elongated filaments ; two Polian 

 vesicles ; two long respiratory trees. Color greyish white, minutely 

 speckled with brown ; five narrow longitudinal brown bands sepa- 

 rating the ambulacral areas. Length about Si inches. 



Calcareous bodies consisting of baskets, knotted and smooth but- 

 tons, and perforated more or less circular disks ; pedicels with fen- 

 estrated plates. Calcareous ring with long back jjrocesses for the 

 attachment of the powerful retracted muscles. 




312 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF • [1888. 



One specimen, from the north shore about a half-mile west of 

 Flatts Village. 



I first mistook this species for the Semperia {Colochirus) gemmata 

 of Pourtales (Proe. Araer. Assoc, 1851, p. 11), described from Sul- 

 livan's Island, coast of South Carolina, but the more exact descrip- 

 tions and figures of that species given by Selenka and Lampert 

 convince me that it is quite distinct. Both species are of a greyish- 

 white color, but no mention is made by either of the authors above 

 quoted of the existence in the Carolinian foi'm of the five longitudi- 

 nal brown bands which extend over the entire length of the Bermu- 

 dian species. Aj^art from this, Semperia Bermudensis differs in the 

 disposition of the tentacles, the greater number of Polian vesicles, 

 and the character of the spicular buttons, which are in the greater 

 number of instances strongly knotted. The posterior processes of 

 the calcareous ring appear also to be much more elongated. 



From Semperia (Cucumaria) pimctata, desci'ibed by Ludwig from 

 the Barbados (Arbeiten aus dem zoolog. zootom. Institats in Wurz- 

 burg, ii, 1875, p. 82) the species differs, apart from the general 

 scheme of coloring — tentacles as well as body — in the different dis- 

 position of the tentacles (9 equal in S. punctata, according to Lud- 

 wig), the smaller number of Polian vesicles (5 in S. punctata), and 

 in the much greater number of filaments composing the genital bun- 

 dles. The vent does not appear to have been rayed. 



Ludwig states that there are in his species no calcareous eeth 

 aboui the anal aperture, whereas Lampert just as positively asserts 

 that they are present (Semper, PhiUppinen, 1885, p. 152). None 

 such were detected in the Bermudian form. 



STICHOPTJS. 

 Stichopus diaboli, n. sp. (PI. 15, Figs. 1, la. lb, 2.) 



Body stout, more or less quadrangular, flattened ventrally, and 

 bearing two rows of prominent marginal, wart-like, tubercles ; 

 sometimes two additional rows of minor tubercles are noticeable on 

 the lateral margins of the dorsum. Tentacles 20, unequal. Dorsal 

 papillse scattered, not prominent, leaving the surface nearly smooth. 

 Pedicels and papillae on ventral surface arranged in three broad 

 bands, which are more or less distinct for the entire length of the 

 body, but most distinct near the extremities; numerous in each 

 transverse row. 



The body-cavity is largely occupied by the greatly developed, and 

 finely dissected, respiratory apparatus, and by the loops of the 




1888.] STATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 313 



variously branched genital organs, which are disposed in two 

 great bundles. Tentacular vesicles present. Two Polian vesicles. 

 Calcareous ring with long back processes. 



Calcareous bodies in the form of stools very numerous (PL 15, 

 fig. 16.) C-shaped bodies very scanty, and possibly in some cases 

 entirely wanting. 



Color black, somewhat more intensely so on the dorsal surface, 

 becoming Vandyke brown or chocolate in alcohol. 



Length, about one foot ; width of corresponding animal about 

 three inches. 



Abundant over the sandy floor of the entrance to Harrington 

 Sound, opposite Flatts Village, in Harrington Sound, and in Castle 

 Harbor, whence it was obtained in several of our dredgings. 



I have little doubt that this species is the dark-brown form 

 which is referred to by Theel as having been obtained by the 

 officers of the Challenger at the Bermudas, and which is doubt- 

 fully referred by that authority to Semper's Siichopus Haytiensis 

 (Report on the Holothuroidea, Challenger Reports, Zoology, XIV, 

 p. 162.) But a single specimen appears to have been obtained, 

 which when examined was too deformed to permit of positive spe- 

 cific determination. I cannot agree with Theel's determination. 

 Apart from the differences which Theel himself points out, is the 

 great diffierence in coloring. Semper (Reisen, Philippinen, Holo- 

 thurien, 1868, p. 75) states that his species is dark chocolate-brown, 

 blotched with yellow' spots, which form five longitudinal bands, 

 corresponding to the iuterradii. No such coloration is visible in our 

 species, although probably we observed as many as a hundred indi- 

 viduals, all of which were uniformly black. Semper's description of 

 the coloring of StichojoKS Haytiensis is restated by Lampert. 

 Stichopus xanthomela, n. sp. (PI. 14, fig. 1 ; PI. 15, fig. 3.) 



Body stout, flattened ventrally, and bearing on the basal margin 

 two rows (one row on each side, as in the preceding species) of prom- 

 inent wart-like processes. Tentacles 18, unequal, w'hitish or gray, 

 edged with brown. Dorsal papillae fairly prominent, scattered. 

 Pedicels on ventral surface crowded, arranged in three longitudinal 

 series, five to eight, or more, in each transverse row. 



Body-cavity, as in the preceding, largely occupied by the respira- 

 atory tree and the doulile genital bundle, the filamental j^rocesses of 

 the latter much finer than in S. diaboli. Tentacular vesicles present. 

 One (?) Polian vesicle. 




314 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF ' [1888. 



Calcareous bodies, in the form of stools (PI. 15, fig. 3), very 

 numerous. C-shaped bodies scarce, in the form of broadly-opened 

 calipers. Ground-color reddish-yellow, irregularly blotched with 

 black or very dark brown. The spots on the ventral surface more 

 or less coalescent in the median line, foi-ming there a broad longitud- 

 inal band, or entirely united to form a uniformly dark-colored 

 base ; on the back, united into two irregularly ramifying or wander- 

 ing bands. 



Length of longest specimen about ten inches ; width about two 

 and a-half or three inches. 



The same habitat as that of the preceding species, although appa- 

 rently much less abundant. 



I strongly suspect that this is the form which Theel, in his report 

 on the Challenger holothurians {loc. cit., p. 159), identifies with 

 Stichopus Moh'd (Semper), one specimen of which, " rather deformed 

 and compressed " when examined by Theel, was obtained at the 

 Bermudas. I assume the identity in this case, as well as in that of 

 the preceding species, on the ground that the two species here de- 

 scribed are the characteristic forms of the archipelago, and it is 

 barely possible that they could have escaped the attention of the 

 Challenger people. But the identification with Semper's species 

 appears to me to be erroneous. The resemblance to Stichopus Mohii 

 appears to rest almost wholly ujion the form of the spicules, which 

 are largely similar in many very distinct forms of Stichopus, and in 

 a general scheme of coloring. But Semper distinctly states (Holo- 

 thurieii, loc. cit, p. 246) that the characteristic spots are almost wholly 

 wanting on the ventral surface, and no mention is made of their 

 occurrence there by Lampert, in his revision of the species of the 

 genus {op. cit., p. 108.) Moreover, Semper affirms that the body is 

 devoid of wart-like tubercles, whereas such are quite prominent in the 

 Bermudian form, although not as prominent as in Stichopus diaholi. 

 Theel, however, makes no mention of the occurrence of tubercles in 

 his single specimen, but probably through contraction in alcohol 

 their existence had been effaced. The number of pedicels in each 

 transverse row seems also to be much more numerous in the Ber- 

 mudian species than in Stichopus Mohii. 



Another apparently related form is Stichopus errans of Ludwig 

 (Arbeiten zoolog. zootom. Inst, Wilrzburg, 1875, p. 97), described 

 from a specimen in the Hamburg Museum, reputed to have come from 

 the Barbados. But in this species there appear likewise to be no 




1888.] NATUEAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 315 



lateral tubercles, nor is the coloring like that of our species, although 

 in this regard there may be considerable variation. The number 

 of tentacles is stated by Ludwig to be 19, and their color yellow. 

 The form from the Barbados which is somewhat doubtfully referred 

 by Theel (foe. cit, p. 191) to Ludwig's S. errans would seem to be 

 more nearly related to the Bermudian species. 



ASTEROIDEA. 



AVe obtained but a single species of star-fish on the Bermudian 

 coast. This is the Asterias Atlantica of Verrill, a form which had 

 already been previously noted from the Bermudas (Trans. Conn. 

 Acad. Sciences, i, p. 368), and whose range extends to the Abrolhos 

 Reef, Brazil. With very few exceptions the rays were either six or 

 eight in number, and of the total number of individuals examined I 

 believe that not over two had five arms. The species exhibits a marked 

 want of constancy in ornamentation and coloring, the dorsal spines 

 being in some cases acute, while in others they are terminated by a 

 minute bead ; again, while the maculation is brown in some individ- 

 uals, in others it is blue, or of both colors combined. 

 Asterias Atlantica, Venill. 



Common in the entrance to Harrington Sound, opposite Flatts 

 Village — under stones ; dredged in Harrington Sound. 

 Ophidiaster Guildingii, Gray. 



This species, which was first described from St. Thomas, is appar- 

 ently a member of the Bermudian fi^una. A single specimen, marked 

 as having been collected l)y Mr. Janney in the Bermudas, is in the 

 possession of the Academy of Natural Sciences. 



OPHIUROIDEA. 



Six species of ophiwrians were obtained in our dredgings and 

 under rock shelters, the greater number of which, as far as I am 

 aware, had not hitherto been reported from the Bermudas. For a 

 critical examination and review of the species I am indebted mainly 

 to my assistant, Mr. J. E. Ives, who has made a careful study of all 

 the species in the collections of the Academy of Natural Sciences. 

 From an examination of many of these forms I feel satisfied that 

 too much dependence should not be placed upon the constancy in 

 minute details of either the form or relative size of the arm plates 

 and their appendages, nor upon an exact scheme of coloration. 

 These characters, and others that may be added, which have been 




316 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



drawn in very close limits by Mr. Lyman in his several memoirs, 

 vary materially within the limits of the same individual, and render 

 the discrimination of species which have been most "elaborately" 

 defined as to exact lengths and breadths of the arm-shields and oval 

 plates, the precise form and number of the arm spines, etc., a mat- 

 ter of almost hopeless possibility. 



Ophiocoma crassispina, Say. 



One specimen, taken at low water from the North Rock, which 

 agrees perfectly with the species described by Say from the coast of 

 Florida (Journ. Acad. Nat. Sci., Phila. v, p. 147). This species is 

 generally considered to be identical with the Ophiocoma {OpJmtra) 

 echinata of Lamarck, but I am disposed to consider this identification 

 erroneous, unless, indeed, several distinct forms, as has been averred 

 by Miiller and Troschel (System der Asteriden, 1842, p. 98), wera 

 included by Lamarck in his species. Two distinct forms, closely re- 

 lated to each other, certainly do occur in the West Indies, one of 

 Avhich, with more blunt arm spines, is (clearly Say's species, while the 

 other, with more elongated arm spines, and much less stoutly 

 developed uppermost si)ine, more nearly corresponds to the general 

 type of Lamarck's species. 



Ophiocoma pumila, LUtken. 



A fragmentary specimen ; exact locality unknown. This species 

 had been recorded by the Challenger from Bermuda. 



Ophiostigma isacantha, Say. 



Two very young specimens, dredged in Harrington Sound. 

 Ophiactis Krebsii, LUtken. 



0. Mulleri, Liitken ? 



Two very young specimens, dredged on the north shore between 

 Bailey's Bay and Shelly Bay, which manifestty belong to one or the 

 other of the above species, although partaking of the characters of 

 both. They agree with 0. Krebsii in having a lobe to the outer edge 

 of some of the upper arm plates, and in the banded character of the 

 arms, while they differ from that species in having but four arm 

 spines. In this respect they agree with 0. Mulleri. Possibly the 

 two species are only varieties of the same form. 



Ophionereis reticulata, LUtken. 



Very abundant at low tide in the rock shelters of Shelly Bay ; 

 also under stones at the entrance to Harrington Sound. 




1888.] >^ATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 317 



Ophiomyxa flaccida, LUtken. 



One specimen, dredged in Bailey's Bay. 



ECHIXOIDEA. 



The number of species of echinoids observed by us is six, of which 

 five had already previously been ascribed to the archipelago ; Cidaris 

 tribuloides, as far as I am aware, had not hitherto been collected— 

 at any rate I have been unable to find any mention of its occurrence 

 there. One species, Mellita sexforis, we did not ourselves collect, the 

 specimens in our possession having been kindly donated to us by 

 local collectors. 

 Cidaris tribuloides, Bl. 



Fairly abundant among the coral shelters of the North Rock. 

 Diadema setosa, Graj^ 



This species, one of the gems among sea-urchins, is exceedingly 

 abundant in the flats about the North Rock, where, in magnificent 

 contrast to the wealth of color by which it is surrounded, its ebony- 

 black masses stand out in prominent relief from the coral shelters 

 which it inhabits. All the individuals occupied recesses in the coral 

 growth, which they had by some means probably managed to keep 

 open. It seems hardly likely that they should have crept into these 

 shelters after they had been already formed, and that the association 

 is one of mere selection. It is a noteworthy fact that while most of 

 the animal forms inhabiting this portion of the growing reef were 

 brilliantly colored, harmonizing with, and shielding, one another by 

 their party tints of red, yellowy purple, and green, these urchins were 

 alone conspicuous by the absence of any such protective cloak; but 

 just in their case no protective guise in the form of coloring would 

 be needed, inasmuch as these animals are abundantly able to shield 

 themselves by means of their extremely attenuated spines. 



This species is also abundant in the moderately deep water that 

 lies within the reef border. 

 Hipponoe esculenta, Leske. 



North Rock, and the deeper water within the growing reef 

 Echinometra subangularis, Leske. 



Several specimens from the flats about the North Rock. There 

 is a certain amount of variation in the coloration of the spines, 

 which ranges from olive or sea-green to purple. 




318 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



Toxopneustes variegatus, Lamk. 



We found this species very abundantly in Harrington Sound, 

 Avhere it rarely escaped being hauled up in our dredge. It seems to 

 frequent the calcareous bottom to a depth of 10-12 fathoms, or even 

 more. Probably the species is equally abundant elsewhere. 

 Mellita sexforis, Agassiz. 



As befoi'e remarked, we did not ourselves obtain any specimens of 

 this species. It is said to be abundant along the calcareous bottoms 

 of some of the inlets, as, for example, opposite Flatts Village. 



CRUSTACEA. 



For the following notes on the Crustacea I am principally indebt- 

 ed to Mr. Witmer Stone, one of my assistants on the trip, who has 

 made a careful study of all our specimens, as well as of the allied 

 and identical species contained in the collections of the Academy of 

 Js^atural Sciences. In the case of in any way doubtful forms I have 

 personally satisfied myself as to the determinations, and particularly 

 in cases where the geographical range appeared to indicate possible 

 or probable error. The occurrence in the Bermudas of a number of 

 what had hitherto been considered to be distinctively Pacific or Old 

 World types, as for example, Pa/emo«e//a tenuipes (Sooloo Sea), Pa^e- 

 vion affinis (Pacific), Penceus velutinus (Pacific) — may be considered 

 positive, even though it be opposed to the common facts of zoogeogra- 

 phy. But this anomaly in distribution is again repeated among the 

 mollusca, as will be seen in the enumeration of species in a future 

 paper. 



The total number of species here enumerated is not very large, 

 but yet it is considerably in excess of the number published in any 

 previous paper, probably one-half of the species being now for the 

 first time credited to the Bermudas. The species of some of the re- 

 maining groups — the Isopoda, Amphipoda — still await analysis and 

 determination. 



BRACHYURA.. 



Microphrys bicornutus, Latr. 



Three females and one male, collected on the beach at the entrance 

 to Harrington Sound. 

 Mithraculus hirsutipes, Kingsley. 



Two males and one small female, which agree in every way with 

 the description of the species given by Kingsley (Proc. Bost. Soc. 

 Nat. Hist., 20, p. 147), except in the number of teeth on the fingers, 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 319 



a character which appears to be very varial)le. The three individ- 

 uals differ in this respect among themselves. 

 Actaea setigera, Milne-Edwards. 



One male dredged off Shelly Bay. The individual differs from 

 the description given by Milne-Edwards (Nouv. Arch, du Mus. 

 cfHist. Nat, i, p. 271, pi. xviii, fig. 2) in having the color of the out- 

 side 01 the hands red, instead of black. It however agrees precisely 

 with specimens attributed to Milne-Edwards' species in the collec- 

 tions of the Academy, and labeled as coming from the Florida reefs. 

 The species has also been recorded from Cuba. 



Panopseus Herbstii, var. serrata, De Sau?sen. 



Numerous small specimens, both male and female, from under 

 stones on the beach of St. George's Causeway, and at the mouth of 

 Harrington Sound. The specimens vary greatly in color, some be- 

 ing very light, others dark brown, while a few are reddish ; other- 

 wise they are identical in structure. 



The species, described in the Hist. Nat. du Mexique et des Antil- 

 les (Cnistac, p. 16, pi. 1, %. 7), had previously been recorded from 

 the Bermudas. 

 Lobopilumnis Agassizii, Stimpson. 



One small male, agreeing well with Stimpson's description (Bull. 

 Mus. Comp. Zool., ii, p. 142) except in that it lacks the subhepatic 

 spine. Eecorded from Bermuda and Florida. 

 Neptunus hastatus, L. 



(N. dicanthus.) 



Two small males. 

 Geocarcinus lateralis, Frem. 



Numerous large specimens, from the banks and fields near the 

 south shore. We found them specially abundant near the locality 

 known as Spanish Mark or the Chequer Board, and again not far 

 from Peniskjn Pond. The burrows in places extend diagonally three 

 or four feet, or even more, beneath the surface, and the animals, 

 rapidly retreating into these, are frequently difficult of capture. 



This is, doubtless, the species that is referred to by Willemoes 

 Suhm in the Challenger narrative as Gecarcinus lateralis, and is 

 apparently the G. lagostoma (?) described by Miers in the systematic 

 portion of the Challenger Eeports (Zoology, XVII, p. 218), in so far 

 as this description applies to the single Bermuda specimen. 




320 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



Nautilograpsus minutus, L. 



Oue small specimen dredged off Shelly Bay. 

 Grapsus maculatus, Catesby. 



One large female, and numerous empty shells from Harris's Bay, 

 south shore. 



Pachy grapsus transversus, Gibbes. 



Numerous specimens, including ovigerous females ; very abundant 

 on the rocks about the mouth of Harrington Sound, and also on the 

 Pigeon Rocks, Bailey's Bay. 



Recorded from Florida, West Indies, Australia. 



Cyclograpsus integer, Milne-Edwards. 



One small female. Species recorded from Brazil and Florida. 

 Goniopsis cruentatus, Latr. 



One female, from the mangrove swamp of Hungary Bay, south 

 shore. Although the species was very abundant at this locality we 

 only succeeded in catching a single individual. The mangrove crab, 

 or " mangrove climber " as the animal is sometimes called, burrows 

 among the thickets of mangrove stems and roots, up which it not 

 infrequently climbs to a height of several feet. The great similarity 

 existing between its coloring and that of the bright and partially 

 withered leaves of the mangrove, especially in the shades of yellow 

 and red, renders the animal difficult of detection, and often at a 

 distance of only a few feet, buried among the fallen leaves, these 

 agile creatures escaped observation, even when attentively sought 

 after. We have here one of the most remarkable instances of 

 protective coloring, or semi-mimicry, with which I am acquainted. 



Sesarme cinerea, Bose. 



Numerous specimens, from the beach of Flatts Village. The 

 species was seen almost everywhere scampering over the rocks. 



Calappa fiammea, Herbst. 



A single male individual obtained through purchase. Species pre- 

 viouslv recorded from the Bermudas. 



ANOMURA. 



Petrolisthes armata, Gibbes. 



Five specimens, obtained on the beach of Flatts Village, appear to 

 be identical with the form described under this name from Florida, 

 (Proc. Amer. Assoc, 1850, p. 190.) 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 321 



Cenobita Diogenes, Latr. 



A number of living specimens obtained at Wistowe, opposite 

 Flatts Village, and kindly presented to us by Miss Edith Allen, 

 daughter of the American Consul. Most of the animals are still liv- 

 ing (October), and apparently flourishing, three months after their 

 capture. The shells occupied by the largest individuals are those of 

 Natica catenoides. • 



Calcinus obscurus, Stiinpson. 



Several specimens obtained on the beach of Flatts Village. 

 Clibenarius (Pagurus) tricolor, Gibbes. 



Numerous on the beach of Flatts Village and at the St. George's 

 Causeway ; under stones, etc. 



MACRURA. 



Palinurus Americanus, Lamk. 



We observed a number of specimens of the large Bermuda cray- 

 fish, but unfortunately obtained none. I am unable, therefore, to 

 state positively if the species is correctly referred, but in all prob- 

 ability it is the same as the common West Indian form. 



Scyllarus sculptus, Milne-Edwards. 



One specimen, purchased at the Crawl, which agrees Avith Milne- 

 Edwards' description (Hist. Nat. des Crust, ii, p. 283) and Lamarck's 

 illustration in the Encydopedie, pi. 320. The locality of the origin- 

 al specimen appears to have been unknown, nor have I been able 

 to obtain data regarding this species from any of the later writers, 

 by many of Avhom it is entirely ignored. 



Alpheus avarus, Fabr. 



(A. Edwardsii, Audouin.) 



(A. Bermudensis, Spence Bate.) 



A series of some twenty specimens collected at the same locality 

 shows considerable variety of form. The smaller specimens are 

 evidently the A. Bermudensis of the Challenger Reports, while the 

 larger ones, agreeing with these in the ^structure of the head, etc., 

 more nearly approximate in the configuration of the hand A. avarus 

 and A. Edwardsii, the former a common Old World species, and 

 the latter, a species described from the Cape Verde islands. Our 

 series contains what might be considered undoubted representatives 

 of all three (so-called) species, showing all the gradations that unite 

 or separate the forms from one another. Hence, I am constrained 



22 




322 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



to look upon them as mere varietal forms of a single species, the Al- 

 pheus avarus of Fabricius. The older the specimens, the more 

 deeply grooved is iu most cases the hand. 

 Alpheus minus, Say. 



A number of species taken from sponges and tunicates collected 

 in Harrington Sound. All the individuals were of small size, meas- 

 uring rather less than an inch in length, although the females were 

 abundantly provided with eggs. 

 Alpheus formosus, Gibbes. 



One specimen (dredged) which agrees well with Gibbes' descrip- 

 tion (Proc. Amer. Assoc, 1850, p. 196), and seems to indicate that 

 the species is distinct from Alpheus minus, with which it is united 

 by Kingsley. The specimen is larger than any of the individuals of 

 A. minus, and is also differently colored, although appearing identi- 

 cal in alcohol. 



Palaemonella tennipes, Dana. 



Several specimens dredged off Shelly Bay, which agree perfectly 

 with the species described by Dana from the Sooloo Sea (U. S. Ex- 

 ploring Expedition, Crustacea, p. 582). The remarkable distribu- 

 tion here indicated induced me to make a very careful examination 

 of the Bermudian species, which has left no doubt in my mind as to 

 the identity of the forms from the antipodal region of the earth's 

 surface. The only other known species of Paleemonella, P. orientalis 

 (Dana), is likewise an inhabitant of the Sooloo Sea (Dana, op. cit. ; 

 Spence Bate, Challenger Reports, Zoology, XXIV, p. 786). 

 Palaemon affinis, Milne-Edwards. 



Numerous specimens from shallow water, Castle Harbor. All are 

 exactly like one another, except in the number of teeth on the beak, 

 which may be 8 above and 4 below, or in the relations of 8-3, 7-3, 

 9-3, and 9-4. This character is manifestly a very variable one, and, 

 therefore, of little or no value from a classificatory point of view. 

 The specimens agree well with the descriptions and figures of A. 

 affinis, although that species has hitherto been recorded, as far as I 

 am aware, only from the Pacific (obtained by Dana off Xew Zealand) 

 The species is near to the Eurafricau P. squilla, but yet sufficiently 

 distinct to permit of ready recognition as only an allied form. 



It is remarkable, in view of the distribution and the number of 

 specimens that we obtained of this species, and the position of the 

 island group, that we should have failed to obtain any individuals 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 323 



of the common form of the eastern United States, Palcemon vulgaris. 

 Whether the species is entirely absent or not I cannot of conrse say, 

 but it is surprising that it should not have been observed by us. 

 Penseus velutinus, Dana. 



One specimen, which agrees with the figure and description of the 

 species obtained by Dana off the Sandwich Islands (U. S. Exploring 

 Expedition, Crustacea, p. 604), and which was subsequently collect- 

 ed by the Challenger party at various points in the Pacific, and be- 

 tween Australia and New Guinea (Challenger Reports, Zoology, 

 XXIV, p. 253). This species, as well as all the immediately related 

 forms, has, as far as I know, been found thus far only in the Pacific. 

 The case is, therefore, another example of remarkable geographical 

 distribution. 



STOMATOPODA. 



Gonodactylus chiragra, Latr. 

 One specimen from the beach of Flatts Village. 



MOLLUSGA. 



The enumeration of species of molluscous animals is left for a 

 future paper, as our collections, large as they are, are doubtless in 

 great part deficient. Through the kind energies of local collectors 

 I hope to suj^plement at an early day the material obtained by us^ 

 and to present, as nearly as is possible, a full list of the species 

 inhabiting the Bermudian waters. We ourselves collected some 110 

 or 120 marine species, which is largely in excess of the number 

 that has thus far been chronicled in any list of Bermudian species, 

 but the examination of private collections in the islands satisfies me 

 that there must be an additional 30 or 40 species, or more, that are 

 common to the island group. 



It is a well-known fact that the Bermudian molluscan fauna 

 is distinctly, and it might be said, overwhelmingly Antillean in 

 character, by far the greater number of species being found in 

 the Bahamau and West Indian Seas, or along some part of the coast 

 of Florida. The practically total absence of species of the Eastern 

 United States Avhich are not found in the Floridian' waters is aston- 

 ishing, and shows how insuperable is the barrier which the waters of 

 the Atlantic, and of the Gulf Stream particularly, offer to a free 

 migration or dispersion of the species. This, again, appears the more 

 remarkable in the light of certain anomalies of distribution which a 

 critical examination of the species reveals, and which had already 




324 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



in many cases been noted as a characteristic of the West Indian 

 fauna. Thus, of the various species of Triton, Triton chlorostoma and 

 T. tuberosus are members of the Mauritian fixuna, and Triton cyno- 

 cephalus and T. pileare of the fauna of the Philippines ; Ranella 

 cruentata crops up in the variety R. rhodostoma, from Mauritius. 

 Again, Epidromus condnnus, from the Philippines, is represented in 

 our collections by a number of individuals which are absolutely 

 undistinguishable, both in shell ornamentation and color-markings, 

 from the Pacific specimens, although they differ somewhat from the 

 closely related^. Swifti, from Antigua. A number of other forms, com- 

 mon to the west coast of Africa and to the southern waters of Europe, 

 also occur. Among a number of American west coast species which, 

 I believe, have not hitherto been recorded from the Atlantic may be 

 mentioned Chama exogyra and Tellina Gouldii, both from the 

 Californian coast. In the case of both of these forms I have very 

 carefully satisfied myself as to absolute identity. Area solida from 

 the west coast does not appear to differ measurably from A. Adamsii^ 

 a West Indian form which has its representative in the Bermudian 

 fauna. 



The following notes on new species are given in advance of the 

 publication of the full list. 



CEPHALOPODA. 



Cuttle-fishes are said to be abundant in the Bermudian waters, but 

 we were not very successful in our search after these animals. Two 

 moderately large octopods, which we could only see, but not obtain, 

 may possibly be the common West Indian Octopus vulgaris, or one 

 of the forms that have been separated off from it as a distinct species. 

 We made considerable efforts to capture one of these, but all 

 our attempts to dislodge the creature from its hold upon the interior 

 of a rock crevice wex'e unavailing. The following species Avas ob- 

 tained beneath a stone on the beach of Flatts Village. 

 Octopus chromatus, n. sp. (PI. 16, fig. 1.) 



Body spheroidal, somewhat acuminate behind, and impressed, but 

 not furrowed, ventrally; mantle opening extending about one-half 

 around the circumference of the body, and terminating some distance 

 below and back of the eyes. The head not much narrower than the 

 body ; eyes not conspicuous, with a wart above each ; funnel largely 

 free, reaching about half way to the base of the web, which is about 

 as long as the body and head combined. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 325 



Arras longest as 1. 3. 2. 4, although possibly the second pair 

 outmeasured the third pair previous to contraction ; slender, very 

 tapering, and exceedingly attenuated toward the apex ; suckers fairly 

 large, closely placed, and in i-egular zigzag alternation from the base, 

 contracting with a quadrangular outline. 



Body granulated posteriorly, and to a less extent in the region of 

 the neck. Color milky, closely blotched or speckled with ochre, 

 giving a yellowish appearance, and sprinkled with brown. 



Length of specimen about nine or ten inches. 



The only form with which I can closely compare this species is the 

 Octopus Bermudensis of Hoyle (Challenger Reports, Zoology, XVI, 

 p. 94, PI. II, fig. 5), which is described from a single young specimen, 

 measuring, including the arms, not more than two and a-half or three 

 inches. It differs from this form in the extremely tapering and 

 attenuated arms, their relative lengths (1. 3. 2. 4 instead 1. 2. 3. 4), 

 and in the disposition of the acetabula, which are in zigzag alterna- 

 tion from first almost to last ; the body is also in part granulated, 

 and the siphon, instead of being attached for nearly its full length, 

 is largely free. 



I should have hesitated perhaps in describing this as a new species, 

 distinct from 0. Bermudensis, and preferred supposing that the 

 characters indicated by Hoyle were not very clearly marked, or that 

 they possibly represented only the immature form, but Hoyle dis- 

 tinctly states that while his specimen is probably immature, the 

 characters are so well marked as to safely permit of their recognition 

 as typical of a new species (op. cit., p. 95). 



GASTEROPODA. 



Aplysia aequorea, n. sp. (PI. IG, iig», 2, 2a, 2b). 



Body broadly oval, with a moderately elongated neck; tentacles 

 cylindrical, slit at the extremity; buccal lobes broad, infolded; 

 mouth between fiiirly developed lips ; aperture to opercular cavity on 

 a slightly raised papilla. 



Color drab or greenish ; exterior surface with thin black annula- 

 tions and irregular markings, which are few and scattered ; the inside 

 of the mantle-lobes, as well as the cover to the opercular cavity, al- 

 most free of blotches. 



Shell narrowly-elongate, somewhat oblique, and calcareously lined ; 

 longitudinally radiated, and transversely finely striated. 



Length of animal about four and a-half inches. 



A single specimen, found in shallow water on the south side of 

 Castle Harbor, opposite Tucker's Town. 




326 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



The nearest ally of this species is probably the Aplysla ocellata of 

 D'Orbigny, from the Canary Islands, or the common A. dadylomela, 

 from the eastern Atlantic, of which the former is by some authors 

 considered to be only a local variety (Rochebrune, Nouvelles Archives 

 du Museum, 1881, p. 264). From both of these forms, apart from 

 other characters, it differs in the absence of the heavy ocellation, and 

 from A. dactylomela in lacking the pui'ple lining on the mantle 

 margins. From A. ocellata, again, it is clearly marked off by the 

 non-maculated surface of the interior of the mantle lobes and of the 

 opercular covering. The shell in the Bermudian form is compar- 

 atively narrower than in any other large species of Aplysia with 

 which I am acquainted, and wholly different in outline from that of 

 either of the tAvo species above referred to. I have fully satisfied my- 

 self on this point thi'ough an examination not only of the figures 

 furnished by Rang and D'Orbigny, but of actual specimens. 



Dobson, in a communication made before the Linnsean Society of 

 London (Journ. Linn. Soc, Zoology, xv, p. 159, et seq., 1881), iden- 

 tifies a specimen of Aplysia from the Bermudas with the A. dady- 

 lomela, and describes the color as being " a rich drab, marked all 

 over with circles and streaks of velvet black, the latter most abund- 

 ant on the mantle covering the shell and on the lateral swimming 

 lobes. The shell agrees in all respects with that of A. dactylomela as 

 figured by Rang, and the only difference observable is that the mar- 

 gins of the swimming lobes are not tinged with violet. This might 

 be accounted for by supposing tbat such a fugitive color had disap- 

 peared in the alcohol, but the captor does not remember to have 

 seen it in the living animal." This may be the true A. dactylomela 

 or A. ocellata, but it is, doubtless, distinct from the species above de- 

 scribed. I am confirmed in this supposition by the examination of a 

 specimen recently collected by Prof Dolley in the Bahamas, and which 

 has been placed in my hands through the kindness of Prof. Leidy. This 

 Bahaman form has the massive ocellation and blotching distinctive 

 of A. ocellata or A. dactylomela, and further agrees with these two 

 species (or varieties) in the form of the shell. The stellate opening 

 to the opercular cavity appears to be destitute of a papilla. This is 

 the form, probably, that ]Mr. Dobson received through Surgeon R, 

 Vacy Ash. 



Deshayes described some years ago an Aplysia, ocellated and of a 

 yellowish color, from Guadeloupe (Journal de Conchyliologie, 2d. ser., 

 ii, p. 140) under the name of Aplysia Schrammil, but the species is 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 327 



SO imperfectly characterized that it is almost impossible to determine 



its exact I'elationships. 



Chromodoris zebra, n. sji. (PI. 16, figs. 3, .^a.) 



Animal of the form ty})ical of the genus ; head portion consider- 

 ably extended and expanded in motion ; caudal portion moderately 

 elongated ; base flattened ; mantle beaded immediately over the tail. 



Color bright blue above, variously lined and streaked with light 

 yellow ; on the dorsal surface the yellow markings are disposed in 

 longitudinal wavy or nearly straight lines, one or more specially 

 prominent lines along the dorso-lateral border. Sides of animal ir- 

 regularly reticulated or angulated with yellow markings; under 

 surface pale blue, bordered with faint yellow. 



Ehiuophores deep indigo or black, the rhinophoral aperture border- 

 ed with yellow ; gills 12 or 13, black, bordered with yellow, and carry- 

 ing blue cilia ; under surface of head blue, with yellow spots. 



Length, when expanded, three and a-half inches. 



Three specimens, dredged in about ten fathoms on the north side 

 of Harrington Sound. I dissected one of these and found that the 

 stomach is lodged entirely within the mass of the liver. The ali- 

 mentary canal is sharply deflected forward (dorsally) beyond the 

 buccal or oesophageal tracts, and is caught up in a nerve ring pro- 

 ceeding from the supra-oesophageal ganglia. 



This species appears to be third or fourth of the genus found in 

 the western Atlantic. It difiers clearly from the C picturata of 

 Morch ( C. Morchii, Bergh, Mus. Godef., part xiv) and C. gonafophora 

 of Bergh, two West Indian species. In the scheme of coloring the 

 species appears to be nearest to Doris pulcherrima of Cantraine {Mal- 

 acologie Med iter raneenne, p. 57, PI. 3, fig. 6, = D. Villafranca f of 

 Risso), from which, however, it differs in a number of details, such 

 as the number of gills, etc. 

 OncMdium (Onchidiella) trans-Atlanticum, n. sp. (PI. 16, figs. 4, -la.) 



Body convex, smoke color or dark olive ; lighter, dirty or greyish 

 green on the under surface ; pedal disk considerably more than one- 

 third the width of base, yellowish green ; mouth margin papillose, 

 bunchy ; under surface obscurely or obsoletely tuberculose ; dorsal

Length about three-quarters of an inch. 



About a dozen specimens, found in a rock hollow on the north 

 shore just beyond Wistowe, near Flatts Village, at an elevation 

 of about two feet above the water. 



This is, as far as I am aware, the only species of Onekidium that 

 has thus far been recorded from the western Atlantic. Its occurrence 

 is, therefore, of considerable interest as bearing upon the subject of 

 geographical distribution. Nearly all the species of the genus are 

 confined to the Eurafrican and Indo-Pacific waters, although one 

 species is known from Arctic America, one from the Californian 

 coast, and one from the west coast of South America (Bergh, 

 in Semper's Reisen im Archipel d. Philippinen, Land Mollusks, 



VI). 



The Bermudian species appear to be most nearly related to 

 0. Carpenterl, from the Californian coast, but differs from it in color. 

 The positions of the anal and respiratory apertures differ from what 

 is indicated by Stearns (Proc. Acad. Xat. Sci., Phila., 1878) to 

 exist in the west American form, although agreeing with the deter- 

 minations made by Bergh for manifestly the same species.

Remarks on the fauna of Beach Haven, N. J. — Prof. Leidy stated 

 that he had spent the last two summers at Beach Haven, on which 

 he made the following remarks : The place, a summer resort, is 

 situated on the island of Long Branch, a sand bar but a few feet 

 above the ocean level, 22 miles long and little more than half a mile 

 wide, off the New Jersey coast, from M-hich it is separated by Little 

 Egg Harbor and Barnegat Bays. The island consists of the ocean 

 beach, flanked by long low sand hills and meadows extending to the 

 bays. It is treeless, but produces fi-equent patches of wax-myrtle, 

 Myrica cerifera. While the variety of marine anjmal life in the 

 vicinity is comparatively small, a few forms adapted to the special 

 localities are abundant. The ocean beach consisting mainly of fine 

 silicious sand without pebbles, between tides, swarms with the mole 




330 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



crab, Hippa talpoidea, and the little mollusk, Donax fossor. Above 

 tides, the beach oft-times is lively with sand-fleas, among which are 

 conspicuous the Talorchestia macrophilmbna, and less commonly the 

 T. longicornis. "Still higher extending to the sand-hills, the sand- 

 crab, Ocypoda arenaria, is frequent. The mud of the bays and 

 sounds swarms with the scavenger snail, Ilyanassa ohsoleta, while 

 the meadows abound with the marsh snail, Melampns bidentatus. 

 The borders of the meadows are thickly planted with the horse- 

 mussel, Modiola plicatuld, or are honey-combed by the fidler crab, 

 Gelamnus pulgilator. The bays supply the market with abundance 

 of the oyster, which is extensively cultivated for the purpose. The 

 clam, Venus mercenaria, also occurs in the greatest abundance, and 

 is constantly gathered for the market. The squirt-clam, 3Iya 

 arenaria, is likewise supplied from mud flats of the bays. The 

 edible crab, Calllnectes hasto.tus, often occui's in the bays in great 

 numbers. The previous summer, the bottom appeared to swarm 

 with them, but the last summer they were less numerous, in conse- 

 quence, as the flshermen report, of great numbers having been de- 

 stroyed by the severe cold of last winter. In a visit to Beach 

 Haven, in February, I observed many recently dead crabs thrown 

 up on the ocean beach, and feasted on by multitudes of the isopod 

 crustacean, Cirolana concharum. 



The previous summer also, the lady-crab, Platyoniclms oeellaUis, 

 was frequent on the ocean beach near low tide, but during last sum- 

 mer was almost absent. It probably, also sufiered from the cold of 

 last winter, for in February, at Atlantic City, I found a number 

 recently dead, and likewise feasted on by the Cirolana. 



In the bays the spider crab, Libinia caiialiculata, the shrimp, 

 Palaemoneies vulgaris, and the hermit crab, Pagurus longicarpus, 

 are in abundance, and the P. pollicarU is not infrequent. The 

 shrimp is infested to a wonderful degree Avith a parasitic crustacean 

 Bopyrus palaemoneticola. The horse-shoe crab, Limulus polyphem- 

 iis also occasionally occurs on the ocean beach. 



The sand of Beach Haven is remarkably sonorous ; when scraped 

 in walking, it emits a sound like tliat produced by sliding a rubber 

 shoe on the pavement. 



The condition of the ocean beach varies with the direction of the 

 winds and violence of the waves. Mostly, it is remarkably uniform 

 and free from organic debris, and is composed of flne, white quartz 

 sand without pebbles, and with streaks and patches of black sand, 

 w'hich from its greater specific gravity is incessantly sifted from the 

 white sand by the winds and waves. On one occasion, during the 

 prevalence for several days, of a strong north-east wind, the beach 

 above high tide was covered with a broad stratum of black sand 

 from a fourth to an inch thick, over which the white sand w-as 

 blown like columns of smoke and accumulated at the base of the 

 sand hills where it looked by contrast like snow drifts. The organ- 

 ic debris cast ashore mostly consists of materials carried out from 

 the bays, commonly, masses of eel-grass, Zostera marina, and bunch-

es of bladder-wrack, Fucus vesiculosus; the latter often attached to 

 a horse mussel, on which the plant grew. Frequently attached to 

 the plants are various animals, especially Bugula turrita, Obelia 

 covimissuralis, Perophora viridis, Lepas fascicularis, etc. Occasion- 

 ally there are thrown ashore a live beach-clam, Madra solicHssima, 

 a dead shell of the same with attached branches of Sertularia argen- 

 tea, the collar-like sand egg-cases of Xatlca and the chaplet ones of 

 Fulgur. In the experience of two summers medusae were rarely 

 wafted ashore, and these were in fragments and pertained to Cyanea 

 arch'ca and apparently Awre^ia/at^idufo. 



Goose barnacles, Lepus fascmilaris occasionally are not infrequent; 

 and more rarely L. anatifera, attached to fragments of timber, is 

 thrown on the sands. High up on the beach, at the base of the 

 sand-hills and often extending into the valleys between them are 

 multitudes of bleaching shells, the remains of occasional severe 

 storms. Most of the shells are those of the beach clam, Madra sol- 

 idissima, Avhich, everywhere 'on the open coast of New Jersey, ap- 

 pears to be the most common lamellibranch, except the little Donax 

 fossor. The younger shells of the Mactra are often observed along 

 shore, with a circular hole through the umbo, made by Katica. 

 Some years since, at Atlantic City, I observed a number of beach 

 clams,' in the sand between tides, which were in possession of Natica 

 heros in the act of boring the shell. 



Among the occasional shells on the beach, fragments of large ones 

 of PJiolas costata are not infrequent, and yet an experienced clam 

 catcher, who is familiar with the ordinary animals of the locality 

 informed me that he had never found a living one. 



My friend Joseph Willcox and I made several attempts at dredg- 

 ing in Little Egg Harbor, but with very little result of interest. 

 Near the mouth of the bay, we drew up great quantities of Mijtil- 

 us edidis, less than half grown, accompanied by many star-fishes, 

 Asterias arenicola. In some positions we took numerous dead shells 

 of the oyster and clam, Venus mercenaria, preyed upon by the sul- 

 phur colored boring sponge, Cliona snlphurea. This, after drilling 

 and tunneling the shells in all directions, continues to grow intp 

 masses from the size of one's fist to that of the head, in which condi- 

 tion it is known to the clam-catchers as the " bay pumpkin." _ The 

 skeleton of this sponge is constructed of calcareous pin-like spicules. 

 It also attacks and preys on the shell of the living oyster,_but ap- 

 pears not to do so on'^the living clam. The sedentary habit of the 

 former, no doubt, facilitates its attacks. The shells of the oyster 

 and clam, Vemi-s, bored in a sieve-like manner, and freed from the 

 sponge, are frequently thrown on the ocean beach, and with them 

 rarely the shell of a Mactra bored in the same manner, but I could 

 not ascertain whether the Cliona lived on the shore of the open 

 ocean. 



Another sponge frequently observed growing on living oysters 

 and on dead shells of the same and of the clam, Veniis, is called by 

 the catchers the "red beard," Microciona jyrolifera. It is bright 




332 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



vermilion color when alive, but brown when dead, and masses of it 

 in the latter condition are often found on the ocean beach. It is a 

 silicious sponge and does not prey on the shells of moUusks. 



From an oyster bed we took up some young oysters, an inch to 

 two inches long, with the shell perforated by the " drill," Urosalpinx 

 clnerea. The perforation, made in the vicinity of the adductor mus- 

 cle, about admits an ordinary bristle. An oyster catcher, James R. 

 Gale informed us that the "drill " was introduced into the locality, 

 with spat brought from the coast of Virginia. With the Urosal- 

 pinx we took another snail, Anacliis similis, which Mr. Gale assured 

 us was more destructive, as a borer, to young oysters than the form- 

 er. Another snail which we took, the Eupleura mudata, ]Mr. Gale 

 says has the same habit. 



Attached to oysters were also found a great profusion of the poly- 

 zoon Vesicularia dichotoma.

The Turret Spider on Coffin's Beach.— Dr. HenPvY C. McCook 

 remarked that he had spent July and August, 1888, at Annisquam, 

 Mass., a port of Cape Ann at the mouth of the Squam river where it 

 enters into Ipswich Bay. The eastern shore of the bay opposite 

 Annisquam consists in part of a stretch of sand hills, known as 

 Coffin's beach. The sand is of a beautiful white color and is massed 

 at places in elevations of considerable height, constituting what is 

 known as the " sand hill, " or " the dunes. '' The fragrant bay bush 

 grows in clumps along the edges and summits of these irregular sand 

 elevations, and this is intermingled with patches of tough grass. 




334 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888- 



At his first visit to this beach he discovered several burrows of 

 Lycosa arenicola Scudder/ popularly known as the Turret spider.^ 

 Subsequently he explored the field and found numbers of these 

 Lycosids domiciled in the sand and spread very generally over 

 the dunes. They came down very close to the high water mark. 

 Thirteen burrows were found quite near together, seven in a circle 

 of six feet in diameter. Most of these burrows were about half an 

 inch in diameter. Two were located within twelve iuches, and sev- 

 eral others within two feet of the edge of the sandy ridge which 

 marks the point of highest tide. The tubes vary in size and depth. 

 Some are scarcely larger thau a quill, some, indeed, not much larger 

 than a good big darning needle. These were occupied by young 

 spiders. The adult spiders occupy burrows in the sand about twelve 

 inches or less in depth ; the younglings make holes four iuches deep 

 or less. 



In digging for spiders Dr McCook began to remove the sand ten 

 inches or more from tlie opening of the burrow. Thus the dry sand 

 immediately surrounding dropped away into the excavation, leaving 

 the silken tulie which lined the burrow adhering to the grass stalk 

 or twig which he had inserted within it. The burrows proved to be 

 silk-lined for a space of from four to seven inches, the lining however, 

 being of a very thin texture, not like the tough silken tube with which 

 the Trap-door spider lines her nest, or wliich the Purseweb spider 

 erects along the trunks of trees. Below that point the burrow enters 

 into the sand unliued. The top of the sand is quite dry, but the 

 bottom part, wherein the lower portions of the burrows are made, 

 was invariably found to be damp, and of course closely packed, so 

 that it was not very liable to fall into the excavation. A little cir- 

 cular ridge of sand ordinarily surrounds the opening of the burrow, 

 but he saw in no instance anything like the tower of straws and sticks 

 which this spider builds in the meadows and fields of New" Jersey, 

 Pennsylvania and other points where it has been observed. The 

 drifting of the sand before the wind seemed to have little or no effect 

 upon the burrows which were always found quite open and free around 

 the mouth. Heavy rains which fell during the season had no appre- 

 ciable effect upon the burrows or their inmates although the tubes 

 must often have been filled with water. 



The spiders captured were all of a light hue as compared with the 

 same specimens found in our vicinity. Specimens almost identical 

 with these were found by Dr. Joseph Leidy in the sand at Beach 

 Haven, Xew Jersey : and this pale coloring appears in all other littoral 

 specimens examined. The influence of euvironment, manifest in the 

 lighter coloring of this spider, Avas also seen in a grasshopper or locust 

 which is quite abundant on Coffin's beach. It is almost as white as 



'■ Psyche, vol. II, p. 2, 1877. 



^ Emerton (" New England Spiders of the Family Lyco'^ida;" Trans. Conn. 

 Acad. vol. vi, 1885) describes the species as Lycosa nidi/ex Marx, for what reason 

 he does not state. Scudder made the spider known in 1877; Dr. Marx gave his 

 description in the " American Naturalist" May 1881. The priority is undoubtedly 

 with Scudder's name.

the sand over which it was found hopping. These grasshoppers 

 probably furnish food for the spiders, but the only remains of animal 

 food found within the burrows were those of a large brownish 

 beetle, several specimens of which were picked up on the beach. 



Among the other denizens of the beach are ants of a small species 

 Avhose nests are well nigh numberless. They are made in the sand, 

 but it seemed that the little creatures must hav-e considerable diffi- 

 culty in preserving their galleries and rooms from continual destruc- 

 tion by the caving in of the incoherent particles. However, they do 

 manage it, although in digging to find the character of their galleries 

 the speaker could not so manipulate the sand as to prevent it from 

 tumbling into the formicaries and thus hindering him from studying 

 of the interior. He did not know what the ants feed upon, although 

 he found some of them engaged at the carcass of one of the brown 

 beetles above alluded to, and no doubt the flotsam of the sea thrown 

 upon the beach affords them abundant material for food. He made 

 a number of visits to these sand dunes both by day and night, pro- 

 longing his stay to a late hour in the evening in order to discover 

 something of the outdoor habits of the colony of Turret spiders, but 

 succeeded in learning very little that is new. 



A lady artist who with some companions was sketching upon the 

 beach, (for Annisquam is a favorite field for painters,) informed Dr. 

 McCook that about dusk a large spider was seen moving over the 

 sand towards the water. Supposing this to be one of the above colony 

 the question at once arose, do they come down from the dunes to the 

 wide flat stretch of beach, that is covered at flood and that is uncov- 

 ered at ebbtide, in order to prey upon the sea life that may be left 

 at the retiring of the waters ? Two afternoons and nights were spent 

 from five until nine and ten P. M. endeavoring to solve this prob- 

 lem, but without any results. He then tried another method. Visit- 

 ing the beach in day-time he captured a couple of mature sjiiders ; 

 placed them upon a smooth stretch of clean sand and permitted them, 

 and when necessary compelled them by prodding, to move over the 

 - surface. They left upon the sand a

Many tracks of various kinds of creatures, including such insects 

 as beetles and grasshoppers, and also of some small vertebrate 

 animals, were found. 



But by far the greatest number were tracks which correspon- 

 ded precisely with those made on the previous day by the captured 

 Arenicolas. Multitudes of these were seen upon the sand covering 

 the surface and slopes of the hills and extending to the very border 




336 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



of the surf line. They traversed the ground which had been cover- 

 ed by the tide, but which for a considerable distance is there exposed 

 at the ebb. These foot-prints could be traced everywhere as issuing 

 from and returning to the burrows which he had marked by flagging 

 the grass stalks in their neighborhood. It was thus demonstrated, in 

 this indirect way, that the narrative of his artist friend was correct, 

 and that the Turret spiders do issue from their burrows during the 

 night and perhaps at other periods and traverse the sandy flats, no 

 doubt in search of prey. One half grown spider was captured while 

 wandering on the flat. 



These 'spider tracks were in themselves an interesting study, and 

 Dr. McCook expressed regret that he did not sketch a longer consec- 

 utive series. The motion of the feet was so rapid that he could not 

 determine the order in which they were placed down, nor identify the 

 mark made by any particular foot. The scratch in the figures he 

 thought might ha ve been made by the spinnerets at the apex of the 

 abdomen trailing in the sand. 



Dr. Charles S. Dolley had observed similar tracks upon the 

 sandy beach of Lake Ontario, near Rochester, which were made by 

 the same spiders that dwell in that vicinity. He had found the spi- 

 ders sheltered under the drift on the veiy edge of the shore whither 

 they had doubtless gone in pursuit of prey or to drink.

DISCOVERY OF THE VENTRAL STRUCTURE OF TAXOCRINUS AND 



HAPLOCRINUS, AND CONSEQUENT MODIFICATIONS IN 



THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE CRINOIDEA. 



BY CHARLES WACHSMUTH AND FRANK SPRINGER. 



Since the pubiication of our paper "on the Summit Plates of 

 Blastoids, Crinoids and Cystids, aud their Morphological Rela- 

 tions," ^ we have made several important discoveries bearing on this 

 subject, which have materially modified some of the views expressed 

 therein, as well as at some places in the Revision of the Palseocri- 

 noidea. 



Hitherto we have recognized in the summit of the Palieocrinoids 

 a central plate, surrounded by four large prosimals and two small- 

 er ones, with anal plates interposed between them. In our earlier 

 writings we regarded the two small proximals as representing pos- 

 teriorly a fifth plate; but these, as we have explained (Revision Pt. 

 Ill, p. 47), are really the two posterior radial dome plates, pushed 

 in by the anal structures, the three other radial dome plates being 

 placed at the re-entering angles of the four larger proximals. This 

 was clearly pointed out on PL VII, in figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 

 on Plate VIII, figs. 1, 3, in which the plates formerly considered as 

 the smaller proximals were marked as actinal radials, and designated 

 by the letters "x r." In fig. 7, PI. VII, they correspond to, and prob- 

 ably are, the first or inner covering pieces of the ambulacra. After 

 discovering that these plates are situated radially and not inter- 

 radially, we met with frequent difficulty in identifying the two small- 

 er proximals, and mistook for them some of the plates which we 

 now clearly see are anal pieces. In some cases, and especially in 

 very complicated forms, we observed intercalated between the prox- 

 imals, touching the central piece, certain plates which we regarded 

 as the representatives of the first and second radials of the dorsal 

 cup, absent in the vault of simpler forms ; while we considered those 

 underneath which the bifurcation of the ambulacra takes place — 

 being the radial dome plates in the simpler forms — as the representa- 

 tives of the third or axillary radials. 



From the internal structui'e we found that the radiation of the 

 ambulacra was from underneath the central j)late, in a similiar man- 

 ner as the ambulacra from beneath the five orals in the Neocrinoidea, 



1 Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia, March, 1887.

338 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



and it was tliis, principally, that led us to the supposition that the 

 central plate, and this only, represented in the vault of the Palseocri- 

 noids the five orals collectively, and that the four large and two 

 smaller proximals were interradial vault plates, cori'esponding to the 

 interradials of the abactiual side (Rev. III., pp. 44-59). The latter 

 was conti'ary to the views originally expressed by us (Rev. II, pp. 15 

 and 16), when we supposed that "the six proximals surrounding 

 the central plate represented the basals or genitals." The great 

 objection to this interpretation was that it involved a homology 

 between six plates and five, and we were so greatly impressed with 

 the force of it, that we were afterwards led to consider these j^lates 

 as interradials, as to which on the dorsal side a division of the pos- 

 terior interradial into two plates by the interposition of an anal 

 plate is a frequent occurrence in Palteocrinoids. It seemed to us 

 therefore very natural that a similar division of the posterior plate 

 should be found on the ventral side. 



Dr. P. Herbert Carpenter, like ourselves, recognized a central plate 

 and six proximals, but he regarded the former as the actinal representa- 

 tive of the dorso-central or terminal plate of the column in the Pen- 

 tacrinoid larva, and established for it the term "oro-central," as a 

 distinct element in the vault of the Palseocrinoids, unpresented in 

 other Echinoderms. He adopted the theory that the surrounding 

 six proximals are the homologues of the basals, and as such are the 

 oral plates — he considering that the posterior one was divided by 

 anal plates into two. His views on this subject are fully set forth 

 in the Challenger Report on the Stalked Crinoids, pages 158 to 184, 

 and the same interpretation of the plates in question Avas reasserted 

 by Etheridge and Carpenter in the Catalogue of the Blastoidea in 

 the Geological Department of the British Museum, pages 66 to 75. 



Although this conception of the morphological relations of the 

 proximals agreed with the ideas we originally entertained, as before 

 mentioned, we found ourselves unable to reconcile it with the diffi- 

 culty arising out of a homology of six plates which surround but do 

 not cover the oral centei-, with a set of five closed oral plates which 

 cover the mouth. This objection did not exist as to the central 

 plate which covers the oral center, and it seemed to us, therefore, 

 more reasonable to regard that plate, though undivided, as the re- 

 presentative of the five orals, than to consider it an entirely new ele- 

 ment in Echinoderm moi'phology, which the so-called "oro-central" 

 of Carpenter certainly was. Our theory of the relations of the sum- 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 339 



mit plates, in conformity with these ideas, was discussed in the Re- 

 vision of the Palieocrinoidea, Part. Ill, pages 44 to 59, and after- 

 ward in greater detail in our paper on the Summit Plates, above 

 referred to. 



Another consideration which strongly influenced us in adopting 

 this view was the supposed presence of a central plate in Haplocri- 

 nus, to which considerable importance was attached both by Car- 

 penter and ourselves in our discussions of the oral question, though 

 leading us to very different conclusions. On page 56, Revision, 

 III, we said : "A far less objectionable interpretation of the central 

 plate than that given by Carpenter would be to regard it as a pos- 

 terior oral. In this case the orals would be represented by five 

 plates, and not by six ; the anus would be placed outside the oral 

 ring, and the radial dome plates would occupy the same position to- 

 ward the orals as the calyx radials toward the basals. But it would 

 place the mouth underneath the posterior oral, and it offers no ex- 

 planation of the central piece in Hwplocrinus." 



This theory seemed to us at that time veiy plausible, and we 

 should have advocated it, if it had not been for the central plate 

 in Haplocrimis, which we discovered, as we supposed, in a speci- 

 men of H. mespiliformis, our observation being verified by Carpenter, 

 to whom we sent the specimen for examination, (Challenger Report, 

 'page 158). 



When we took up a year ago, the investigation of the Larvi- 

 formia, the group to which 'Haplocrinus belongs, we had before us 

 the original specimens of H. clio from i!^ew York, and found 

 ourselves unable to discover any suture between the so-called central 

 plate, and the posterior vault plate, and we began to suspect there 

 was something wrong about the central plate. During a visit of one 

 of the writers to Europe in the winter of 1887-8, he procured in the 

 Eifel mountains a very large series of good specimens of H. mes- 

 piliformis, with a view to ascertaining if possible the real fact about 

 the central plate, and also the anal opening which was fully as great 

 a mystery. These specimens at once disclosed the fact that the 

 "central plate" is a myth, and that what had before been taken for 

 it was simply a more or less tongue-like or polygonal prolongation 

 of the posterior plate, sometimes surmounted by a small node — the 

 "knopf" of Goldfuss. We had mistaken a fracture in our original 

 specimen for a suture on the posterior side, and have seen another 

 in which a similar mistake might have been made if one had that

specimen alone. The real structure of the vault of Haplocrinus is 

 as follows : The five triangular plates composing the ventral pyramid 

 meet in the center by sutures which are often difficult to see. The 

 posterior plate is the largest, and projects in between the two postero- 

 lateral ones, completely separating them, and interlocking with the 

 antero-lateral plates by a variety of plans, from a simple zigzag suture 

 to a triangular or dovetailed insertion, or a long slender tongue ex- 

 tending into the latter plates, w^hich are cut away to fit it (PL XVIII, 

 figs. &L and 61). This projection stands sometimes at a lower level 

 than the other part of the plate and the adjoining plates, leaving a 

 depression in the center which is sometimes partially occupied by a 

 small node. In other cases a high ridge runs from the posterior 

 plate over the central space, branching to the two antero-lateral 

 plates (PL XVIII, fig. 61). It thus appears that the whole ventral 

 surface in Haplocrinus is covered by five large plates which meet in 

 the center as in Alia gear inus. 



The anal opening in Haplocrinus has not heretofore been correct- 

 ly identified, but it has been generally claimed to be located at the 

 suture between two radials and the posterior vault plate. In the 

 Revision III, pp. 157 and 162, we alluded to a small pore we had 

 observed in one specimen of H. mespiliformis, the position of which 

 is indicated in fig. 1, on PL V, of that work. We afterward became 

 satisfied that this pore was due to chemical action, or some im- 

 perfection in the test and w'as not organic, as subsequent examina- 

 tion of a very large number of specimens of the same species, better 

 preserved, failed to disclose any opening in that position. After we 

 discovei-ed that the so-called central plate was nothing but a pro- 

 longation of the posterior vault plate, it became easy to distinguish 

 that plate in the specimens, and we began a careful search upon that 

 side, from the radials up, for the anal opening. "We soon found a 

 small, scar-like opening or pit, with a slightly thickened and well 

 defined rim, situated just within the upper angle of the triangular 

 depression on the posterior plate (PI. XVIII, fig. 61). A similar 

 structure was observed in a large number of specimens, varying in 

 form from that above described to a small tubercle in which no 

 opening could be detected. It was always in the same position, and 

 we have been unable, after the closest examination, to discover any- 

 thing like it upon either of the other four plates in any of the 

 specimens. We ground down a number of specimens on the pos- 

 terior side, and in every one found that this was an actual opening. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 341 



piercing the plate, in a similar manner, and in the same position a& 

 the anal opening pierces the deltoid in Orophocrinus, and we could 

 not find on these ground specimens, any indications of another open- 

 ing lower down. These facts led us to the conclusion that the above 

 described opening must be the anus, and that it was probably closed 

 by minute pieces as in Orophocrinus. We think it quite probable 

 that the tubercular elevation which appears in several of the speci- 

 mens, may represent the closed condition, the plates being too small 

 to be distinguishable, especially in fossils whose preservation is so 

 peculiar that the suture lines between the large vault plates are 

 often invisible.^ 



So long as the central plate in Haplocrinus was recognized, we 

 saw good reason to believe in the existence of a similar plate in 

 other groups of the Pakeocrinoidea, especially as a plate similarly 

 situated over the center of radiation was so conspicuous a feature in 

 the vault of many diflJerent genera. But after it became evident 

 that no such plate in fact existed in Haplocrinus and allied forms, 

 the idea recurred to us that the plate, so apparently central in 

 many Platycrinidae and Actinocrinidae, might after all bo. the pos- 

 terior oral, pushed inward to a central position by anal structures, 

 which we had formerly suggested. With the objection arising out 

 of the supposed condition of Haplocrinus removed, this interpreta- 

 tion seemed to us to be one of the greatest force, more likely than 

 any other to answer the conditions of a valid homology, and to 

 obviate the principal objections urged by Carpenter and ourselves, 

 respectively, to other theories. 



Upon comparing the summit plates of the Platycrinidae and 

 Actinocrinidae, it will be seen that the so-called central plate is 

 always inserted between the four large proximals, so that in most 

 cases it occupies, more or less, the center of figure, being enclosed on 

 the posterior side by anal plates, and abutting against them. In 

 Dorycrinus (PI. XVIII, fig. 2), an enormous development of the 

 central plate is shown. In Agaricocrinus (PI. XVIII, fig. 3), the four 

 proximals have been separated from it by the intercalation of other 



1 Upon our communicatinj^ to Dr Carpenter several months ago our observatioiis 

 upon Haplocrinus as above set forth, he informed us that Prof. Beyrich, of Etrhn, 

 had indei)endenily discovered the same facts, both as to the construction of the 

 ventral pyramid, and the location of the opening- which we consider to be the anus, 

 and that Beyrich also regards this as the anal opening, while he (Carpenter) thinks 

 it an open question whether it be ilie anus or a water pore, in which Litttr ca>e 

 the anus would remain undiscovered. 




342 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



plates; while in the later Talarocrinus (PI. XVIII, fig. 7) they seem 

 to have disappeared entirely, leaving only the central plate, from 

 which the covering plates to the ambulacra pass directly out. In 

 forms like Batocrinus (fig. 5), and Eretmocriuus (fig. 10), where 

 there is a strong, nearly central anal tube, we find the central plate 

 resting against, and forming the base of the tube, and the four prox- 

 imals pushed far over to the anterior side, and greatly displaced. 



In some forms of Platycrinus the central position of the posterior 

 plate is well marked (Rev. III. PL, VII, figs, 5, 6, 7, 8, and PI. 

 VIII, fig 6), varying somewhat in degree. Some recently acquired 

 specimens of this genus exhibit most clearly a transition from a 

 centrally located plate surrounded by proximals and anals, char- 

 acteristic of the foregoing figures, to a set of five nearly equal 

 plates, occupying the center of figure in the vault, and from whose 

 five re-entering angles the ambulacra pass out to the arms, as shown 

 by the beautiful specimen in fig. 15, (and also by figs. 4, 8, and 9). 



In all these cases it will be observed that the posterior plate is in- 

 serted between the four proximals to a greater or less extent, sepa- 

 rating the posterolateral ones, so that the five plates meet in the 

 vault in a manner substantially similar to the five plates composing 

 the ventral pyramid of Haplocrinus. No one who is acquainted 

 with the structure of palaeozoic crinoids will doubt that the five 

 unsymmetrically arranged plates in the vault of Dorycrinus, Batocri- 

 nus, etc, are structurally identical with the five nearly equal plates 

 centrally located in the specimens of Platycrinus above mentioned. 

 And it will be seen at once that all the disturbance observable in' 

 different degrees in these various forms was primarily caused by 

 the anal structures, which pushed the plates — especially the posterior 

 one — out of their primitive position. Regarding these five plates as 

 the orals, it will be found that the five radial-dome-plates lie within 

 the re-entering angles all around, and that the two rings of plates 

 thus correspond exactly in their relative position with the basals and 

 radials upon the dorsal side in the Crinoidea, and the genitals and 

 oculars in the Echini. 



The above interpretation of the plates meets with no serious difll- 

 culty from a morphological point of view. The only objections 

 occuring to us that might be urged against it are: 1. that the mouth 

 would be situated beneath the posterior oral; and 2. that some 

 species of Talarocrinus and Dichocriiius have in the summit in place 

 of five orals a single very large plate, from underneath which the 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 343 



ambulacra pass out to the rays. The first of these objections, -which 

 was raised by us already in Revision III, p. 56, is readily explained 

 if we suppose that the posterior oral was pushed inward over the 

 mouth by the plates connected with the anus, and that this became 

 a constant character in palaeontological time. The presence of a 

 single large central plate in Talarocrinus, etc, may be accounted for 

 by resorption of the four anterior orals, the posterior plate actually 

 performing the functions of all. It might also be possible that this 

 large plate in these forms represents the whole oral pyramid, five 

 plates coalesced, in a similar manner as the basals in some instances 

 at the dorsal side. 



These considerations were quite sufiicient to convince us that the 

 five orals of Xeocrinoids were represented in the Palaeocrinoids by 

 both the central plate and four large proximals taken together ; 

 thus in a large measure reconciling the conflicting views of Carpen- 

 ter and ourselves upon this question — the orals being found at last 

 to consist of a portion of the proximals which he has claimed, with 

 the addition of the central plate which we have contended for. 

 This rational result, as often happens in such cases, adopts what was 

 sound, and rejects the errors in the views of both parties. 



The evidence which we had obtained was entirely satisfactory to 

 us, and we were prepared upon the foregoing facts to announce our 

 final conclusion, as above stated, when we made a most unexpected 

 discovery, which in our judgment not only settles the oral question 

 in conformity with these views beyond all controversy, but bears so 

 strongly upon questions of classification, that it may justly be regard- 

 ed as one of the most important discoveries ever made in palaeozoic 

 crinoids. 



In the Ichthyocrinidae the ventral structure has been hitherto 

 almost totally unknown. Some small plates had been seen on the ven- 

 tral side in a few instances, apparently belonging to a plated integ- 

 ument, but not in a condition to aiFord much information, and its 

 real nature has been a matter of conjecture and theory. We have 

 been of the opinion that it was a vault, covering a subtegminal 

 mouth and ambulacra, but pliant, yielding to motion in the calyx 

 and arms; while Carpenter believed that it was a disk paved by 

 plates as in some of the Neocrinoidea. It was evidently of the most 

 fragile construction, and this, together with the fact that in this 

 family the arms are generally found closely folded and firmly im- 

 pacted over the vault, was strongly against the probability of ever 




344 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



finding the ventral covering in place. We had seen, however, in 

 some specimens of Taxocrinus from the Kinderhook beds at Le 

 Grand, Iowa, that there was an integument of some kind taking 

 the form of pouches along the ventral side of the rays, and this in- 

 duced a faint hope, in viewiof the unusually fine preservation of the 

 fossils at that locality, that something more might eventually be 

 found out about it. 



On the 9th of August last, we made an excursion to Le Grand, 

 for the purpose of obtaining some needed material for our work on 

 the Crinoids of Xorth America now in progress. Upon arriving at 

 the station we met Mr. George (Jull, the agent of the Chicago and 

 Northwestern Railway, to whom we were already indebted for many 

 favors. AVhile exhibiting to us some interesting fossils collected 

 by him in that vicinity, he produced a specimen of Taxocrimis with 

 the greater part of the rays broken off". We saw at once that it had 

 the ventral covering 2:)reserved in place, though largely imbedded in 

 a matrix of exceedingly fine calcareous mud. Upon being inform- 

 ed that the specimen possessed especial value as throwing light upon 

 important scientific questions, he presented it to us, with the re- 

 mark : "I will donate it to Science." For the valuable assistance 

 he thereby aflforded us he has our grateful thanks, and in this we are 

 sure that every naturalist who is interested in the morphological 

 study of Echinoderms will join us. 



Although we saw at once that there was an integument of very 

 small pieces, with covered ambulacral furrows running toward some 

 large plates in the center, it was not until we had with great labor, 

 and the most delicate manipulation, cleaned the specimen from the 

 fine adherent matrix, that we discovered the extraordinary fact 

 that it has an external mouth, surrounded bij five parted oral plates, 

 with the ambulacra converging to it and passing in between the orals. 



The specimen belongs to a species which we have described and 

 figured for the 8th volume of the Illinois Geological Survey, now in 

 pi'ess, as Taxocrinus interm,edius. It represents a form of Taxo- 

 crinus in which there is a strong tendency toward the free and 

 spreading rays of Onychocrinus, to which genus, indeed, we were for 

 some time inclined to refer it. Several specimens of it have been 

 found before, but all of them had the arms closely folded, and were 

 more or less flattened by pressure. This individual, exceptionally, 

 was deposited with the rays well extended and without any flatten- 

 ing, leaving the ventral side in an almost natural jiosition. Most 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 345- 



of the rays are broken off a little above the first bifurcation, so that 

 the whole structure is plainly visible, and, except in one or twO' 

 places, is in the most perfect condition (PL XVIII. figs. 11 and 11). 



The ventral surface is covered by an integument of very small, 

 irregular plates, attached to some larger plates within the dorsal cup, 

 and the marginal plates along the free rays, forming in connection 

 with the latter along the rays pouches or sacs which extend far up 

 along the ai'ms, being traced in other specimens to the second and 

 third bifurcation. Along the median radial portions of this integu- 

 ment rest the ambulacra, which pass from the middle of the disk tO' 

 the rays, following their bifurcations. There are two rows of sub- 

 ambulacral pieces, transversely elongate and alternately arranged, 

 forming the floor of the groove. The groove is bordered by side 

 pieces, and roofed over by two rows of interlocking covering plates, 

 which seem to have been moveable, as they are open in several places 

 in the specimen, — indeed they appear to be mostly in that condition. 

 The anterior ambulacrum is perfect, with the covering pieces in place, 

 and slightly gaping. In the right antero-lateral ambulacrum the 

 covering plates and side pieces have slipped off from the subambu- 

 lacral plates, and lie interradially to the left of them, but are other- 

 wise not much disturbed. In the other three ambulacra the covering^ 

 pieces for the most part are gone, leaving only the floor with the 

 subambulacral plates in position. The plates covering the interpal- 

 mar areas are also well shown in the specimen at three sides; at the 

 two others the integument is not intact, and the plates lie scattered 

 upon the surface. When one sees the exceedingly frail character of 

 this covering, he may well wonder at the exceptional good fortune 

 by which it is preserved in this specimen, and will not expect to find 

 it soon again. 



The central region is occupied by five rounded or very obtusely 

 polygonal plates, interradially disposed, rather elliptic in outline. 

 The two an tero-1 literal plates are tolerably good-sized, and the 

 postero-lateral ones slightly smaller. All four of them have a con- 

 siderable thickness, extending downward below the level of the 

 ambulacra, and also rising somewhat above it. The posterior plate 

 is nearly three times as large as any of the others, and almost twice 

 as long as wide, extending well in between the two postero-lateral 

 plates. 



The I'elative positions of these plates are exactly like those of the 

 five plates at the summit of the forms of Platycrinus illustrated on 




346 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



Plate XVIII, figs, 4, 8, 9, 10, 15, except that they do not meet in the 

 center, but leave a slightly excentric, obtusely pentagonal oral opening, 

 transversely elongated, its longest side next to the posterior oral plate. 

 Into this opening, which is deep, and contains at the bottom some 

 dark-colored substance, converge the ambulacra, their lips turning 

 downward at the five corners. They enter between the five plates, 

 touching them, and completely separating the visible portions of 

 those plates from each other. Whether there is any lateral projec- 

 tion beneath the ambulacra, by which they come in contact again, 

 cannot be seen, but from the form of the exposed portions we should 

 think not. 



That the five plates around the center, although somewhat unequal 

 in size, represent the five orals of the recent genera Rhizocrinus, 

 Hyocrinus, and Holopus, and that the integument of small pieces is 

 a disk and not a vault, nobody will deny after seeing the specimen. 

 And a comparison of the parts in Ihxocrinus with the summit plates 

 in Platycrinus, Adinocrinus, etc, leaves no room for dou))t that these 

 are likewise orals. In the posterior interradius (PL XVIII, fig. 1, 

 c), there is a small lateral appendage or proboscis composed of a row 

 of rounded quadrangular plates gradually tapering upward. This 

 appendage is supported by a small anal plate, which rests upon the 

 right upper corner of the posterior basal and the right posterior 

 radial, both of which are somewhat indented to receive it. The ap- 

 pendage seems to be attached by its inner side to the integument, and 

 there are to the right of it, within the posterior interradius three 

 small tapering ridges composed of very small plates, which look like 

 branches from it; upon close inspection, however, they are seen to be 

 folds in the perisome, into which they are incorporated at their ujiper 

 ends, in a similar manner as the row of larger plates. At the upper 

 end of the appendage there are a great many minute pieces closely 

 packed together, and we think it probable there was an opening at 

 this point. In the two other specimens (PI. XVIII, figs. 16, and Id), 

 the structure is more clearly shown. Neither of them has supjDle- 

 mentary ridges or folds, and it is plainly seen that the large plates 

 composing the proboscis are bordered by numerous small pieces, by 

 means of which they are connected with, or incorporated into the 

 perisome. The upper end of the appendage is rounded off, and stands 

 well out from the perisome, but we have been unable to ascertain 

 from the specimens whether it is perforated by a canal, or solid as in 

 the remarkable recent genus Thaumatocrinus, which in the structure 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 347 



of its posterior side bears a striking resemblance to the form under 

 consideration. From all that we can see on our three specimens, and 

 some examples of Onychocrimis exsculptus, in which a similar set of 

 plates and parts of the perisome are preserved, we do not believe that 

 there was a second appendage in the disk as in Thaumatocrinm, but 

 think that the row of large plates supported the anus. The shape 

 of the visible portions of the disk varies in the three specimens, and 

 it is evident that the whole perisome was pliant and could be expand- 

 ed or contracted. 



A similar integument has been found between the rays in Taxoerinui 

 robustus ^y. and Sj). from the same locality, a new Taxocrinus from 

 the St. Louis limestone, and in OnycJiocrmus aster iaeformis from the 

 Burlington limestone. In a specimen of Omjchocrinus diversus 

 lying on the ventral side, and from which we removed the basal and 

 some of the radial plates, giving an inner view from below% we can 

 see in two rays the alternating subambulacral plates converging near 

 the center, but not the orals nor any part of the perisome. In one 

 of Onychocrinus exsculptus we find remnants of the perisome and 

 traces of the oral plates, however not in position. The last two 

 specimens are those mentioned by us in Revision Pt. I, p. 32, on 

 one of which we based our statement (Rev. I, p. 54), under Oaycho- 

 crimis, that "in the median portion of the vault there are six rather 

 thin but large apical dome plates", which we were afterwards in- 

 clined to modify, as we could not make out satisfactorily the ar- 

 rangement of the plates (Rev III. pp 20, and 67). In several speci- 

 mens of the last named species we have seen the anal appendage, 

 with the integument extending either way to the rays, and the 

 same thing was long ago observed by Meek and Worthen (Geol. 

 Rep. Illinois., Vol. Ill, p. 494.). 



It is thus evident that the ventral covering of Taxocrinus consist- 

 ed of perisomic plates with external mouth and food grooves, and 

 five oral plates, surrounding the mouth and separated by the ambu- 

 lacra. We have now very little doul>t that the structure thus dis- 

 covered is substantially that of the Ichthyocrinidae generally, and 

 that the ventral side of the calyx in this family is morphologically 

 in the condition of Thaumatocrinus, and similar to that of Hyocrinus 

 and Rhizocrlnus. 



Although we have heretofore entertained a different opinion, we 

 yield most cheerfully to the proofs, and we are heartily glad to be 

 the means of bringing to light one substantial fact to take the place 




348 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



of theories, even though some of our own views suffer in consequence. 

 We also take jileasure in bearing this testimony to the soundness of 

 Dr. P. H. Carpenter's views as to the nature of the ventral covering 

 in the Ichthyocriuidae. He always considered that this family rep- 

 resented an approximation to the Neocrinoids, and that the integu- 

 ment was comparable to a disk and not to a vault. ^ 



This discovery is also a confirmation of the opinion always insist- 

 ed upon by us, as a conclusion necessarily following from the struct- 

 ure of the calyx and arms, that the ventral covering of the Ichthyo- 

 criuidae was pliable, yielding to motion in the calyx and arms, and 

 emphasizes the distinction between this group and other Palaeozoic 

 Crinoids based on the summit structure, as pointed out by us at the 

 beginning of our writings (Rev. I, p. 5), although, we admit, to a 

 higher degree than we ever anticipated. 



Recurring now to the orals, it is easy enough to understand from 

 the structure of Taxocrinus how a set of five equal plates, symmet- 

 rically disposed over the mouth as in the larva o^ Antedon, could be 

 so altered by the presence of anal structures, as to bring the mouth 

 beneath the posterior plate. , It is readily conceivable, that by the 

 encroachment of the anal plate, the posterior oral was pushed to a 

 centi'al position, and remained permanently in that condition. The 

 transition from five unequal to five equal orals through such forms as 

 Platycriinis (PL XVIII, fig. 15), seems also quite apparent. The 

 fact that the covering plates of the ambulacra in our specimen rest 

 against the lateral edges of the orals, is contrary to the observations 

 heretofore made among recent crinoids in which orals have been 

 observed. In all of them the ambulacra pass in at their outer mar- 

 gins, and the plates are parted so as to form open slits. In the 

 Camarata the orals remain closed, and the ambulacra, — when ex- 

 posed at all, — with their food grooves closed, enter the vault on or 

 before approaching the orals. 



We therefore consider the evidence entirely conclusive that the 

 homologues of the five oral plates of the young Antedon and the 

 adult Holopus, Hyocrinus, Rhizocrinus and ThaumatocriiiK.s are to be 

 found in the so-called central plate and four large proximals in all 

 Camarata in which these are developed — the two smaller proximals, 

 heretofore considered as the equivalent of a fifth, being anal plates. 



The question now naturally arises, what are the morphological 



1 Challenger Report on the Stalked Crinoids, pp. 42, 181 and 182, and else- 

 where. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 349 



relations of the ventral plates in Haplocrinus, in view of the discov- 

 ery that it has no central plate? Those plates meet in the center, 

 and cover the mouth substantially in a similar manner as the five 

 orals in Platycrinus ; being, however, more alike in form and size, 

 and more regular in their arrangement. They also closely resemble 

 the five orals of the Pentacrinoid larva of A^itedon, but, unlike 

 them, are suturally connected with one another as well as with the 

 radials. The plates also occupy the position of the five interradials 

 of Cyathocrinus and the deltoids of the Blastoidea ; resting like the 

 latter upon the limbs or upper extensions of the radials. 



We have heretofore contended, against the views of Carpenter 

 and others, that the ventral plates of Haplocrinus are interradials 

 and not orals, believing the latter to be represented by the "central 

 plate," which we took to be the homologue of the so-called central 

 plate of Actinocrinidae and Platycrinidae. 



It would seem to follow naturally that with the elimination of the 

 central plate from the question, the chief objections to considering 

 the five summit plates as orals, which impressed us so strongly 

 before, would now be removed. A serious morphological difficulty, 

 however, is still found in the position of the opening which we 

 suppose to be the anus. This, as we have already described, pene- 

 trates the middle portion of one of the vault plates — a structure not 

 found in any other known Crinoid, either in the adult or larval 

 state. The position is the same as that of the anus in the deltoid of 

 the Blastoid genus Orophocrinus, which complicates the case still 

 more. 



It is further a fact that in the lowest Silurian Camarata inter- 

 radials are more profusely represented than among Carboniferous 

 forms, frequently extending over the whole ventral surface of the 

 calyx, while the orals apparently are unrepresented. From this it 

 would seem- to follow that if Haplocrinus represented a larval form 

 of the Palaeocrinoidea, the plates in question could not be orals, or 

 the structure would appear to be at variance with the palaeontolog- 

 ical development of the group. 



For these difficulties we are unable at present to oflfer any ex- 

 planation, but nevertheless Ave admit that there are very strong rea- 

 sons for regarding those plates as orals. They present a striking 

 resemblance to the five plates composing the unopened oral pyramid 

 of the Pentacrinoid larva before its separation from the radials 

 by perisome, and there are unquestionably very strong grounds 




350 PROCEEDIJs'GS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



for considering Haploerinus and allied genera as larval forms. 

 Taking into consideration all the facts as now disclosed, and espe- 

 cially the non-existence of a central plate, we must admit the weight 

 of the evidence is in favor of the supposition that thf plates cover- 

 ing the ventral surface in Ha2ylocrbius, and AUagecrinus are orals, 

 and that these orals are permanently closed in the Haplocrinidae 

 without the assistance of interradial plates. In accepting this as 

 probably the correct interpretation of those plates, we now recognize 

 also in Symbathoerinus and Pisocrinxis five large orals as covering 

 the greater part if not all of the ventral surface, more or less similar 

 to those of Haploerinus, though with a very different anal arrange- 

 ment in Symbathoerinus, and probably also in Pisocrinxis. 



A still broader question remains to be considered, viz: the effect 

 of the late discoveries upon the classification of the Crinoidea, gener- 

 ally. In proposing the Palaeocrinoidea as a distinct order of the 

 Crinoids, we considered the presence of a subtegminal mouth, and 

 the closed state of the food-grooves, as the most important char- 

 acters bv which they were distinguished from Mezozoic and more 

 recent forms. But it is evident that since the discovery of an open 

 mouth in the Palaeozoic genus Taxocrinus, we can no longer by this 

 means separate the earlier from the later crinoids. Carpenter did 

 not agree with us as to the importance of the subtegminal mouth, 

 and he proposed to separate the Palaeocrinoids from the Neocri- 

 noids principally upon other features which he discussed in detail in 

 the Challenger Report on the Stalked Crinoids, pages 149-155. A 

 slight examination will show that all these other characters meet 

 with so frequent and important exceptions in both groups, that it 

 is not safe to depend upon them. 



According to Carpenter, in the Neocrinoidea underbasals are re- 

 presented rarely, in the Palaeocrinoidea frequently (Challenger 

 Report, p. 149). Several years ago we discovered that there is a 

 regular alternation in the arrangement of the successive parts of 

 crinoids below the radials, which furnishes a most important guide 

 for distinguishing between monocyclic and dicyclic crinoids, by the 

 structure of the column and cirri. It was stated on page 7 of the 

 Revision, Part III, — with a most unfortunate transposition of terms 

 in printing, which we corrected on page 294, — and which may be

AVe have found this rule to be without exception among palEeozoic 

 crinoids, and upon the strength of this, and an examination of the 

 column of such Neocrinoids accessible to us as possessed an angular 

 column, or cirri, we came to the conclusion, as stated in the Revision 

 III, p. 8, that "probably many Neocrinoids either possess small 

 underbasals, or these were present in their larval form. " We became 

 more and more of the opinion that the Neocrinoids, for the most part, 

 were built on the plan of dicyclic crinoids, and we again stated (Rev 

 III, p. 7 1 ), that "all Neocrinoidea, or at least the most of them, in their 

 larval state may have possessed rudimentary underbasals, hidden by 

 the column. " On pages 294-299, we discussed this question more 

 at length, and stated our conclusion to be (p. 298) that "either the 

 rules which meet with no exceptions among Palaeocrinoidea, as far 

 as we know, do not hold good for the Neocrinoidea, or the genera to 

 which we alluded, and which are built otherwise upon the plan of 

 dicyclic crinoids, really possessed rudimentary underbasals during 

 life, as Extracrinus and certain species of Millericrinua, or that 

 perhaps underbasals were present in their larva. The ventral surface 



1 Our observations respecting the column were naturally restricted to species 

 in which the stem and axial canal are angular, and in alluding to the sections and 

 sutures of the column we refer to species with a peniapartite stem. In cases in 

 which only basals are visible, and the angles of the stem are interradial, underba- 

 sals invariably are present beneath the column.

of the centro-dorsal in some species of Antedon is almost identical 

 with that of the top stem joint oi MiUericrinus ; the plate is also 

 interradial (PI. 6, fig. 11), and rests, as in the Apiocrinidae, against 

 the outer face of the basals, not within the basal ring. It is similar 

 in other Comatulae, in all of which the centro-dorsal is interradial, 

 and upon this, mainly, we base the opinion that perhaps also the 

 Comatulae in their early larva had rudimentary underbasals. That 

 these plates if present were not observed, is not surprising, as they 

 may have been very minute, and been covered entirely by the 

 column." 



So strongly were we impressed with the conviction that the Com- 

 atulae were dicyclic crinoids, that we urged European investigators 

 to make a fresh search for the underbasals in the larva, notwith- 

 standing that no trace of them had been found by Wyville Thomson, 

 the two Carpenter, Gotte and others, who had extensively studied 

 the embryology of Antedon. 



It was therefore with no little satisfaction that we received the 

 information in July 1887 that the underbasals, Avhose existence we 

 had thus predicated upon palaeontological evidence, had actually 

 been discovered in the early larva o^ Antedon rosacea. This import- 

 ant discovery was made by Mr. H. Bury, who announced it at the 

 Manchester Meeting of the British Association in 1887. Mr. Bury's 

 paper giving the full details of his investigations, has not yet appeared, 

 although understood to be in press. The results, .however, are stated 

 by Carpenter' as follows : " while this paper was in press an important 

 discovery was announced by ^Ir. H. Bury at the Manchester Meeting 

 of the British Association. He has found the underbasals in the 

 ciliated larva oi Antedon rosacea; but they soon fuse with the top stem 

 joint (centro-dorsal), and all trace of them is lost when the cirri 

 appear. This is a very striking confirmation of the views of Messrs. 

 Wachsmuth and Springer, whose palaeontological studies had led 

 them to express the belief that the underbasals might be present in 

 the early larva of Comatulae. " 



Upon the same grounds, we think, we may safely postulate a 

 dicyclic base in the extensive families of Apiocrinidae and Pentacrin- 

 idae, and all other Neocrinoid families in which the so-called centro- 

 dorsal or top stem joint is described as forming an integral part of 

 the calyx as in the Comatulae, and whose stem, when angular, is

 Vol. XXVIII, New. Ser. p. 311.

directed interradially. In two species of Millerlcrinus rudimentary 

 underbasals have already been found by De Loriol/ and in both of 

 them the plates in question are attached to the top stem joint. 



From these facts we may fairly say that the dicyclic plan prevails 

 far more generally among Neocrinoidea than among Palaeocri- 

 noidea. 



It is very interesting to note, in this connection, that the under- 

 basals in many of the Ichthyocrinidaeare of an exceedingly rudiment- 

 ary nature. In Ichthyocrinus they are scarcely ever seen at all, being 

 usually visible only on the interior of the dorsal cup. In Taxocrinus 

 they are always hidden by the column, and sometimes visible only 

 within the calyx, which led Schultze to call them " cryptobasalia. " 

 In Forbesiocrmus and Oiiychocrinus they are nearly always concealed 

 by the column, and furthermore in some cases they seem to be fused 

 with the upper joint of the column, for they separate from the 

 basals and remain attached to the column when the latter is broken 

 off. It is therefore a suggestive fact that in Millerlcrinus polydadylus 

 and M. Orbignyi, the two species in which De Loriol discovered 

 underbasals, these were in a precisely similar way separated from the 

 basals and firmly attached to the column. 



Another distinction relied on by Carpenter is that in Neocrinoids 

 " by far the greater number of genera have five equal and similar 

 basals, with five equal and similar radials resting upon them. " He 

 excepts Hyocrinus, which has three basals, and Holopus and Eudesi- 

 crinus in which the radials are not symmetrical ; and he adds : " but 

 this want of symmetry is not due to the intercalation of any anal 

 plates as in nearly all Palaeocriuoids. " He therefore admits a certain 

 amount of asymmetry in Neoerinoids, so long as not due to anal plates, 

 though he elsewhere attaches some importance to a similar irregularity 

 in some Palaeocrinoids, when confined to basals and radials only, and 

 not in any way connected with anal plates, as for example Eucalypto- 

 crinus.'' 



Another point characteristic of the later crinoids brought out by 

 Carpenter is that " the articular facets of the first radials occupy the 

 whole width of their distal faces, so that the lowest parts of the rays, 

 whether divided or not, are of nearly the same width as the radial 

 plates which bear them (Chall. Rep. p. 155). Exceptions to this are 

 found in Hyocrinus, Plicatocrinus and Marsupites. It is true that

"^ Challenger Report, p. 151.

354 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



in the Palaeocrinoids there are many families in which the articular 

 facet of the first radial simply occupies the middle of its distal edge, 

 but this is not the case with the Ichthyocrinidea, the most of the 

 Poteriocrinidae, Cupressocrinidse, and Symbathocrinidae. 



The main point, upon which Etheridge and Carpenter,^ and after- 

 wards Carpenter alone,^ distinguished the two groups Avas stated to 

 be the regularly pentamerous symmetry of the calyx in Neocrinoids 

 contrasted with the asymmetry of the Palaeocrinoids, in which " the 

 pentamerous symmetry of the calyx^ is almost always disturbed by a 

 greater or less modification of the plates on the anal side. " From 

 this Carpenter was obliged to except the genus Thaumatocrinus, as to 

 the ]S^eocrinoidea, which has well developed anal plates. 



A far greater number of exceptions are found in the Palaeocrinoidea, 

 among the Camarata as well as the fnadunata and Articulata. 

 Among the first may be mentioned Do I at ocr inns, Stereocrimis, Centro- 

 erinus, Technocrinus, Cory mboci'inus, Eucalyptocri7ius and CallicrinuSy 

 in which the anal interradius cannot be distinguished in the dorsal 

 cup from the four others; Lyrioa-tmis, Ripidocriniis, Thylacocrimis, 

 Rhodocrinus, and Gilhertsoerbms, in which it is rarely distinct ; and 

 Briarocrinus whose irregularity is not caused by anal plates. Among 

 the Inadunata there are Codiaerinus, Lecythlocrinus, Stemviatocrmus 

 and Erisoci'iniis, in none of which the usual anal plate is known to 

 exist. Among the Articulata, we note Ichthyocrinus and Niptero- 

 crinus as being in a similar condition as Briarocrinus. In some of 

 the above genera, however, there is an irregularity in the basals ; yet 

 this is not due to anal plates, but to a coalescence of two or more 

 of the plates, a variation which is also found in the recent genus 

 Rhizocrinus, and among the underbasals in the Antedon larva.

^ It must be observed that the term " calyx " was used by Dr. Carpenter in the 

 Challenger Report, and by us at that time, to designate the part of the test below the 

 arm bases. Findmg more and more the necessity of having a more stable terminol- 

 ogy, which would be applicable to the Crinoids generally, we have agreed with Dr. 

 Carpenter upon the following terms, which will be used by both of as hereafter for 

 descriptive purposes, viz : — 



Crmoid minus the stem == Crown. 



Crinoid minus stem and arms = Calyx. 



All parts of the calyx below the arm bases =r Dorsal cup. 



The ventral perisome with mouth and ambulacra ^= Disk. 



All parts covering the disk ;= Vault. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 355 



In alluding to the symmetry or asymmetry of the calyx, we must 

 consider only the arrangement of the plates in the dorsal cup, as the 

 ventral covering in all crinoids, whether composed of vault or disk, 

 is more or less disturbed by the anus. 



We do not regard it as a good distinctive character that in the later 

 crinoids the basals are generally pierced by interradial canals or 

 grooves in connection with the chambered organ, when not a vestige 

 of them is seen in Marsupites, and similar grooves are found in 

 Catillocrinus, Mycocrinus, Crotalocrinus and many Fistulata. Nor 

 do we think it of much importance that in some palaeozoic forms the 

 first division of the rays does not take place upon the third radial, or 

 that in one or two cases the first radials themselves are axillary, when 

 among Neocrinoids Metacrinus, as well as Plicatoerinus, form excep- 

 tions to this rule. 



Another of Carpenter's distinctions is that in the Neocrinoidea 

 with the exception of Thaumatocrinus, the primary radials are in 

 contact with one another by the entire length of their sides ; but the 

 fact is that there are also among the Palaeocrinoidea a number of 

 genera, both of the Ichthyocrinidae and Inadunata, in Avhich a 

 similar structure is found. 



Now to the i^resence of interradials, a character upon which we 

 placed so much importance as separating the older from the later 

 crinoids. . We held that interradials were present in all groups of 

 the Palaeocrinoidea, but among the Neocrinoidea only in Thaumato- 

 crinus. This applies very well to the Camarata and perhaps to all 

 Fistulata, but it is possible that among the latter, in certain Carbon- 

 iferous genera, especially within the Poteriocrinidae, their interradials 

 became resorbed. Interi-adials are also absent in the Larviformia, 

 if we regard their large ventral plates as orals. We also doubt if 

 the so-called interradials of the Ichthyocrinidae are the homologues 

 of the interradials in the Camarata, but rather regard them as com- 

 parable with the unevenly distributed, interradially disposed plates, 

 which occur in some of the Apiocrinidae, and which we take to be 

 perisomic. 



The so-called interradials of the Apiocrinidae, which occur only in a 

 few species, vary among individuals and are irregular in their ar- 

 rangement. According to De Loriol ^ they are represented various- 

 ly by one or three plates in the lower row, even in the same species. 

 Owing to this irregularity they have been regarded by us as "enor- 



1 Paleont. Francaise, 1st Serie Anim. mvertebr., Crinoides, p. 272. 




356 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



mously developed perisomic plates" (Revision, Pt III, p. 63), and 

 not as true iuterradials, although they present a more rigid appear- 

 ance than perisomic plates generally have. Our views have been 

 strengthened by De Loriol's important discovery of the plates cover- 

 ing the ventral surface in Apiocrinus roissyanus. ^ According to 

 his description the space between the rays, from the first or the first 

 two interradial pieces up, are occupied by transverse series of tw^o or 

 three small, somewhat regular plates, which gradually lose their reg- 

 ularity, and at the top of the third radial become for the most part 

 entirely irregular and unequal. They differ in their form and 

 arrangement in every one of the interradial spaces, and pass into 

 a conical "ventral sac," which rises to the top of about the ninth 

 brachial piece. The plates composing this ventral covering are 

 equally irregular, and, though tolerably strong, are not absolute- 

 ly rigid. De Loriol considers them as constituting a pliable integu- 

 ment, and not a solid vault like that of Adinocrinus, but in the 

 specimen the central portion was not preserved and he could not dis- 

 cover the condition of the mouth, nor could he find traces of the 

 ambulacra. In the same paper, on page 14, De Loriol also describes 

 a specimen of Apiocrinus magnificus, in which the interradial 

 spaces between the third radials, and up to the first brachial piece, 

 are occupied by numerous irregular plates, dissimilar in the different 

 spaces. He considers these interradial plates, in both species as be- 

 longing to the "ventral sac," which was capable, in his opinion, of 

 contraction or expansion. 



A similar irregularity in the interradials exists among the Ichthyo- 

 criuidae. In Ichthyocrinm interradials and interaxillaries are gen- 

 erally wanting, but in the one species in which they have been found 

 their arrangement seems to be rather uniform in the different spaces. 

 In Forhesiocrlnus, which also has interradials, we frequently find two 

 plates in the first row at the azygous side, in other cases but one. In 

 Taxocrinus, when the rays are close together, there are sometimes no 

 interradials at all, or, when there are more than one, the first is 

 followed by one or two smaller plates. In Taxocrinus Thiemei, the 

 type specimen has neither interradials nor interaxillaries, while other 

 specimens in our collection, not otherwise distinguishable, have one 

 to three interradials. In Taxocrinus interscapular is (Iowa Geol. 

 Rep. 1858, Vol I., Pt II, PL 1, fig. 3), we find a single plate inter-

calated opposite the second and third radials and an interaxilhiry 

 between the second secondary radials. In OnycJiocrinus, and those 

 forms of Taxocrmus which resemble it in the expansion of the rays, 

 like T. intermedius, there is frequently a large first interradial, suc- 

 ceeded by a variable number of smaller ones; while in other cases 

 (PI. XVIII, figs. 1 a, b, c) the lower })lates themselves are quite 

 irregular, following the curvature of the rays. They are connected 

 with their fellows in the same interradius by the plates of the disk, 

 which are attached to their inner edges. In both these genera the 

 structure of the posterior interradius resembles that of the recent 

 genus Thaumatoerinus in having a succession of anal plates forming 

 a lateral proboscis-like projection, counectea for more or less of its 

 length with the perisome. Lecanocrinus, Pycnosaccus, Cyrtidocrinus 

 and Mesjnlocrinus have an azygous and anal plate, but as a rule no 

 interradials. Lecanocrinus macropeta.lus of New York has no 

 interradial plates; while a specimen from Sweden, which agrees with 

 the genus otherwise, has at each side one large interradial. Calpio- 

 crinus' has an azygous plate passing well down between the basals 

 toward the underbasals, and from one to four interradials in the 

 same species. Sagenocrinus^ has a remarkable azygous plate in line 

 with the basals — the sixth parabasal of Angelin — and some varia- 

 bility in the other interradial spaces, although on the whole it is a 

 rather symmetrical form. 



The irregularity. in the arrangement of the interradials, so frequent- 

 ly found in this group, their presence between the higher radials, 

 and absence upon the first primary radials in species, and even among 

 individuals of the same species, has always presented to us a difficulty 

 in classifying the Ichthyocrinidae with the Palaeocrinoids. 



* Calpiocrinus \s not the aberrant genus which we supposed from Angelin's 

 figures (Rev. I , p. 30, S8). A good series of specimens from Dudley, not other- 

 wise distinguishable from C. fivibriatus and C. heterodactylus,—^\i\c\\ are probably 

 synonymous — shows that it has the usual calyx plates of the family — three under- 

 basals and five basals. In a specimen of C. ova/us, the underbasals are concealed 

 by the column, and it is probable that this is the case in most ©f the Swedish speci- 

 mens, and that in some instances the peculiar azygous plate, in line with the basals, 

 has led to a misconception of the latter plates. 



^ Examination ol the specimens leaves little doubt that Sagenocrinnshe]ongs 

 to the Ichthyocrinidae. We noted its resemblance to Taxocrimts (Rev. II, p. 

 202), and it always appeared to us out of place in the family Rhodocrinidae, 

 which is greatly improved by its removal. Our generic diagnosis, made entirely 

 from the figures and insufficient descriptions, is defective and incorrect in some 

 particulars, and wjll be improved hereafter, as the genus has been discovered in 

 America. 




358 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



The interradials in the Apiocriuidae, extending up between the 

 rays, connecting with, and forming a part of the ventral covering, 

 find a close parallel in those of many of the Ichthyocrinidae, and 

 since the discovery of a disk and open mouth in Taxocrinus, we 

 have not the slightest doubt, that these plates represent the same 

 elements in both groups, forming in both of them parts of the disk, 

 and that perhaps the same is the case with the interradials and 

 interaxillaries of Ulntacrinus, which in many respects resemlile those 

 of the Ichthyocrinidae. 



The subtegminal mouth, which we supposed to be the best char- 

 acter of the Palaeocrinidea, proves to be subject to exceptions fully 

 as great as the others. Our recent discoveries show that in some 

 palaeozoic crinoids, and probably in the Ichthyocrinidae generally, 

 the mouth is exposed, and there is no vault aside of the orals; and 

 Ave are not certain but that we may find otlier exceptions among 

 the later Poteriocrinidae and Encriuidae. We now know that there 

 are no additional elements in the oral system of palaeozoic crinoids, 

 but that the mouth opens out in a very similar manner by the })art- 

 ing of the orals as in the larva of recent forms, and this leads us to 

 put less faith than before in the condition of the mouth as a char- 

 acter for the subdivision of the Crinoidea. For these may well be 

 different stages in the development of the mouth, represented in 

 palaeontological time, and we need not be surprised to find at some 

 time a Silurian Ichthyocrinoid with the orals closed, or a Haplo- 

 crinoid with the orals parted. 



From this review of the principal characters relied upon to dis- 

 tinguish the eai-lier from the later crinoids, it Avill be apparent that 

 the exceptions are so numerous as to leave nothing stable or definite 

 on which to base such important primary divisions, and we are again 

 confronted with the problem of rectifying the classification of the 

 Crinoidea, or proposing a new one. It is true that many of these 

 exceptions are due to differences which tend to separate the Ichthyo- 

 crinidae from the Palaeocrinoids, and unite them with the Neo- 

 crinoids ; and it might be the simplest, as well as the least radical 

 change, to modify the definition of the Neoerinoidea so as to admit 

 the Ichthyocrinidae, which would thus fall exactly into that place 

 among them, for which Carpenter was always obliged to make an ex- 

 ception in favor of Thaumatocrinus. In so doing, however, we 

 would be bringing together some of the earliest and latest forms* 

 which would render the name Neoerinoidea wholly inappropriate. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 359 



The two groups would be separated chiefly upon the condition of the 

 mouth, and the name "Stomatocrinoidea," which we proposed in 

 1879 (Revision I, p. 22), might be revived. The greatest objection 

 to this plan, however, lies in the possibility, as before mentioned, of 

 finding an Ichthyocrinoid with closed mouth, or a Haplocrinoid 

 with parted orals, which would upset the whole arrangement. 



To attempt to modify the definition of the Palaeocrinoidea so as 

 to admit forms with an external mouth, is in our opinion entirely 

 out of the question, and would simply increase the difficulties now 

 encountered, because there could not be pointed out a single reliable 

 ■character by which the two groups could be distinguished. 



After considering the question in all its new aspects, as presented 

 by the facts recently brought to light, it is our best judgment, that 

 all attempts to subdivide the Crinoidea by separating the palaeozoic 

 from the mesozoic and later forms as natural divisions, will have to 

 be abandoned, and some mode of separation sought for, entirely in- 

 dependent of geological age. In that case, the names Palaeocrinoidea 

 and Neocrinoidea — unless in the sense of mere conventional terms 

 for designating the palaeozoic and later crinoids — will have to be 

 laid aside. 



To this end we think that four well defined groups can be dis- 

 tinguished as independent primary divisions of the Crinoidea, viz : 



i. Camarata. 



2. Inadunata, including the branches Larvifoi mia and Fistulata. 



3. Articulata, ^ including the Ichthyocrinidae, and possibly Uin- 

 tacrinus and Thaumatocrinns. 



4. A fourth division to include the most of the mesozoic and re- 

 cent crinoids, for which the name Caualiculata* might be very ap- 

 propriately adopted. These divisions will be suborders or orders, 

 depending upon the rank which may be ultimately assigned to the 

 Crinoidea — a question we think still open for discussion. In the 

 definition of them many classificatory criteria, such as the condition 

 of the mouth, the presence or absence of interradials, the relative 

 proportions of the actinal and abactinal regions in the calyx, which 



1 The Crotalocrinidae, which we formerly assigned to the Articulata, have 

 been found to belong to the Camaratn, as we have shown at length in another 

 paper. 



2 This name was proposed by Prof. E. J. Chapman in a jiaper entitled -'A 

 classification of Crinoids," Toronto, 1874, to include the genera Pentacrinus, 

 Antedon, Encrinus, Eugeniacrinus, Apocrimts, Bonrgtteticrinits, and Rhizo- 

 criniis. 




360 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



wlien applied to the older and later crinoids seem to lose much of 

 their significance, will form strong and distinctive characters. Pa- 

 laeozoic and recent crinoids may, if necessary, be brought together in 

 the same group, according to their zoological characters, free from 

 embarrassment arising from restrictions as to geological age. 



The Camarata, Inadunata and Articulata would be defined, as to 

 their most general characteristics, substantially as we have already 

 defined them in the Revision of the Palaeocrinoidea, with some 

 modifications as to the ventral structure in the Inadunata and Ar- 

 ticulata, to conform to recent discoveries. 



We are strongly of the opinion that the recent genera Holopus, 

 Bathyerinus and Hyocrinus might very properly be arranged under 

 the Larviformia. All three are monocyclic, and like the Haplo- 

 crinidae and Symbathocrinidae retain through life large oral plates. 

 But while the orals in these two families are closed and rest direct- 

 ly upon the radials, in the above named recent forms they are part- 

 ed, and separated from the radials by a narrow band of perisome, 

 which, we strongly suspect, was also the case in the Gasterocomidae. 

 The aberrant genus Thaumatocrinus might be refen-ed to the Ar- 

 ticulata, with which, for the most part, it agrees in the asymmetry 

 of the calyx and the construction of the azygous side. Uintacrinus 

 will very likelv foil into the same group ; while the Eucrinidae will 

 probably find a resting place among the Fistulata, and perhaps also 

 Marsxipites. 



The removal of these genera would leave the Canaliculata as a 

 very compact, well defined group. It would contain only crinoids 

 which are dicyclic, or built ujion the dicyclic plan, and in which the 

 underbasals are anchylosed to the top-stem-joint, the two together 

 forming the centro-dorsal. All of them would be free from any 

 disturbance by anal plates, and the basals in all of them, so far as 

 known, would be perforated by interradial canals or furrows in con- 

 nection with the chambered organ. 



The disposition of the later crinoids, as herein indicated, is mere- 

 ly suggestive, as we prefer to leave their arrangement to Dr. P. H. 

 Carpenter, who has made them a special study. 



We shall not at present undertake more than to submit for the 

 consideration of our fellow naturalists the conclusions to which we 

 have been led by the evidence of I'ecent discoveries, leaving to a 

 future occasion the framing of detailed definitions of the divisions 

 we have proposed in case they should meet Avith favor. A con- 




.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 361 



sensus of opinion on this subject is much to be desired, and would 

 greatly facilitate future studies. 



From an interchange of notes with Dr. Carpenter we understand 

 that we are now in substantial agreement upon the oral question, but 

 he will shortly state his own views at length in a paper now in prepa- 

 ration. Should the views herein set forth contribute toward the es- 

 tablishment of a sound classification, we shall consider that our long 

 controversy with Dr. Carpenter, both in print and by letter, has borne 

 good fruit, and we shall waste no regrets over the fact that in some 

 points the result has proved that he was right and we were wrong. 



We give herewith a corrected diagnosis of the family Ichthyo- 

 crinidae to conform to the ventral structure as we now know it. 



Family ICHTHYOCRINIDAE. 



Test pliable. Symmetry of the calyx irregular and usually dis- 

 turbed by anal plates. Base dicyclic. Underbasals three, unequal, 

 rarely visible beyond the column ; the smaller one directed toward 

 the right postero-lateral radial, ^ frequently anchylosed to the upper 

 stem joint. Primary radials perforate ; variable in number among 

 species and individuals from two upward ; either abutting laterally, 

 or separated by one or more plates. Radials and arm joints united 

 by muscles and ligaments ; line of union more or less undulating, 

 frequently with patelloid projections from the proximal margins of 

 the plates ; articular surface usually occupying the whole distal face 

 of the first and succeeding radials. Arms uniserial, apparently 

 without pinnules. luterradials irregular in form, size and arrange- 

 ment, sometimes entirely wanting in species in which they are usually 

 present ; their lateral faces provided with deep ligamentous fossae. 

 Posterior interradius with or without anal plates ; the latter, when 

 present, frequently associated with an azygous plate. Disk, so far as 

 known, paved with irregular perisomic plates, and larger plates 

 between the rays. The center of the disk occupied by five unequal 

 orals surrounding the mouth. Mouth exposed, at least in the later 

 forms. Food grooves lined by moveable covering pieces. Column 

 large, decreasing in size rapidly near the calyx. Geological Position: 

 Palaeozoic. From the Lower Silurian to the Upper Coal Measures. 



1 In the Revision, Pt. III., PI., VI, fig. 23, we represented the underbasals of IcA- 

 thyocrinus incorrectly as directed anteriorly. We have since examined numer- 

 ous specimens of various genera, and find the small underbasals located, as above 

 staled, in all of them.

CROTALOCRINUS : ITS STRUCTURE AND ZOOLOGICAL POSITION. 

 BY CHARLES AVACHSMUTH AND FRANK SPRINGER. 



The type of Crinoids that has been described under the name 

 Crotalocrinus, is one of the most extraordinary yet brought to light 

 from palajozoic rocks. Its net-formed radial appendages, so widely 

 different from those of any other known Echinoderm, and resem- 

 bling rather the fronds of a Bryozoan than the arras of a Crinoid^ 

 have long made it a puzzle to naturalists, and the efforts of all 

 writers up to the present time — ourselves included — have contribu- 

 ted but little tow^ard any satisfactory determination of its systematic 

 relations. Though so highly differentiated in its structure, the 

 genus is confined to the upper Silurian, so far as known. It has 

 been found in the island of Gothland, Sweden, where it was first 

 noticed by Hisinger in 1828, and afterwards described by him as a 

 Cyathocrinus in 1837. It was also found at Dudley, England by 

 Parkinson in 1808, who called it the Turban or Shropshire Encri- 

 nite ; and it was redescribed by J. S. Miller in 1821, as Cyathocrinus 

 rugosus. No trace of it has ever been discovered at any other locality. 

 Good specimens are. rare and difficult to obtain, so that the facili- 

 ties for its study, outside of the countries where it occurs, have 

 hitherto been practically nil. 



The arm structure was not understood until 1854, when Johannes 

 Miiller figured and described under the name Anthocrinus Loveni 

 the principal Swedish species, although Austin had established the 

 genus Crotalocrinus in 1843, for the English form, without figure 

 and with a very meagre description. Angelin's elaborate work on 

 the Swedish Crinoids in 1878, contained numerous beautiful figures 

 of apparently perfect specimens, and seemed to give the most ample 

 illustrations of every part elucidating the structure of this curious 

 fossil. Upon these descriptions and figures, and without any oppor- 

 tunity to study even a single specimen, we prepared our description 

 of the genus, and discussions relating to it, as they appeared in Part 

 III of our Revision of the Palaeocrinoidea. 



Not long after the publication of this work, we found reason to 

 believe that our interpretation of the structure and affinities of 

 Crotalocrinus was erroneous, and that much of what we had written 

 on the subject was altogether worthless. During a visit of one of 

 us to Europe last winter, he had an opportunity of examining the 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 365 



best known English specimens, in the British Museum and other 

 collections, and by considerable effort succeeded in obtaining some 

 excellent material for more detailed study, both from England and 

 Sweden. Besides this we have enjoyed the unexpected privilege of 

 studying a number of the original sj^ecimens used by Angelin. For 

 this we are indebted to Dr. Gustav Lindstrom, Curator of the 

 Palseontological Department of the National Museum at Stockholm, 

 who on being informed of our perplexity regarding this genus, ujion 

 his own motion, sent us these and other specimens, with liberty to 

 study them at our leisure; and also furnished us most important 

 information in the way of drawings and observations upon other 

 specimens. It was an act of thoughtful kindness for which we find 

 it difficult to adequately express our gratitude, and if this paper 

 shall be found to be of any value to our fellow naturalists, it will be 

 in a very large measure due to the facilities thus generously afforded 

 us. 



In the Revision of the Palaeocrinoidea, Part III, pp. 140-143. we 

 referred Crotalocrinus and Enallocrinus to the Articulata, and at 

 various places (pp. 18, 19, 56, 64, 65) based some of our arguments 

 as to the character of this suborder upon the supposed structure of 

 these two genera. On pages 18 and 19 of Part III, we stated that "In 

 the Crotalocrinidae, which include Crotalocrinus and EnallocTinus, 

 the whole ventral surface, in what appear to be the best preserved 

 specimens, is composed of strong, convex plates, without definite 

 arrangement. In these specimens there is no central plate, nor 

 proximals, nor traces of ambulacra (Icon. Crin. Suee., PI. VII, fig. 3a; 

 PI. VIII, figs. 6, 7, and PI. XXV, fig. 2.); there are, however, other 

 figures of Angelin, apparently of a closely allied species (ibid. PL, 

 XVII, fig. 3a), in which the plates paving the ventral surface are much 

 more delicate, and consist of a central plate, large proximals, and sev- 

 eral rows of covering pieces, without the intervention of either anam- 

 bulacral or interradial plates. It would be difficult, with the utmost 

 stx'etch of our imagination, to recognize in the former figures either 

 proximals or central piece, which, as admitted by Carpenter, are 

 present in all these crinoids, and we think there can be little doubt 

 that the two sets of figures represent different parts of the animal, 

 the one the disk, the other the vault, and that the one covered the 

 other. A similar opinion was evidently entertained by Zittel 

 (Handb. d. Palaeont. I, p. 357), who stated that Crotalocrinus pos- 

 sessed five 'grosse Oralplatten, bald unter der Decke, bald ausserlich 




366 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



sichtbar.' According to our interpretatiou, the calyx of the Crotalo- 

 criuidae extends ventrally to the oral pole, and the ambulacra, 

 central piece, and proximals are subtegminal, covered by interradial 

 plates, which extend out to the lower rows of covering plates and 

 side pieces (Icon. Crin. Suec, PL VIII, fig. 6, and PL XXV, fig. 2). 

 A similar condition probably prevailed in the Ichthyocrinidae, with 

 which the Crotalocrinidae have close affinities." 



As our reference of these genera to the Articulata was based ex- 

 clusiveh' upon the figures, especially those of Angelin, it will be well 

 to examine them now in the light of the knowledge we have since 

 obtained. The only figure of those quoted that gives the vault 

 structure correctly, is fig. 3a, on Plate XVII. It shows very plainly 

 four large proximals and a large plate toward the posterior side, 

 which, according to the terminology we then employed, Ave regarded 

 as a central plate. The proximals are elongate-nail-shaped, and 

 two of them touch the incurved ends of the upper faces of the first 

 radials, while two others abut against a small interradial plate, and 

 the larger posterior plate against small plates around the anus. 

 Within the re-entering angles, between every two of the large plates, 

 there are several series of small pieces ramifying toward the arm 

 openings and laterally connected. Dr. Lindstrom has sent us a 

 very carefully prepared drawing of a specimen which he thinks is 

 the original of the above mentioned figure. This is reproduced by 

 us on PL XX, fig. 4. The structure appears substantially the same, 

 but the details are better defined in this figure than in the former, 

 showing that the proximals touch the first radial only at one side, 

 while at the other sides one, two, or three small interradial plates 

 are interposed. Within the five re-entering angles formed by the 

 five orals (central plate and four large proximals),* rest five com- 

 paratively large radial-dome-plates, which are followed by several 

 rows of small alternating pieces. That the latter are covering 

 plates which were continued along the arms is well shown in both 

 figures. 



A totally different stinicture was exhibited by figs. 6 and 7, PL 

 VIII, of Crotalocrinns pulcher, and by fig. 3a, PL VII, and fig. 2 

 PL XXV, of Enallocrinus scriptm, all purporting to show the plates 

 of the ventral side completely. In all of these figures the arrange- 



*The so-called " proximals" and "central plate," as we have shown else- 

 where, are now regarded by us as representing the five oral plates, the central 

 plate being the posterior oral, modified and displaced by anal structures. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 367 



ment of the plates covering the visceral cavity is extremely irregular^ 

 scarcely any two plates being alike. There is neither a central 

 plate, nor anything that might be compared with the four large 

 proximals, and no plates corresponding to, or which might be identi- 

 fied as covering plates until the region of the arms is reached. In 

 PI. VIII, fig. 6, the plates appear ornamented by small nodes up to 

 the second bifurcation of the i-ay, and a similar ornamentation cov- 

 ers the anal structure, of which portions are visible. This ornamen- 

 tation is so marked, and gives to this part of the figure such a total- 

 ly different aspect from the higher branches of the rays, in which it 

 is entirely absent, that we regarded it as a vault, from underneath 

 which the covering plates emerged. The whole figure gives one the 

 impression that it was made from a very perfect specimen, in which 

 the minutest details of structure were exceptionally well preserved. 

 The other figure-7-on the same plate exhibits a similar vault, but 

 with less elaboration of ornament and surface details. Covering 

 plates are here visible only upon the parts which extend beyond the 

 limits of the calyx, nor is there any trace of proximals or central 

 plate. 



Figure 3a, of PI. VII, which is said to represent " jx(rs 2)ei'isomatis 

 ventralis" of Enallocrmus scrlptus, shows a complete uninterrupted 

 covering of the whole ventral surface of the calyx and poi-tions of 

 the rays. As in the other figures, the plates are wdiolly wanting in 

 definite arrangement, no summit plates can be discovered, and the 

 covering pieces, as before, begin at the periphery of the calyx. 



Another figure of the same species, apparently from a most beau- 

 tifully perfect specimen, to judge from the drawing, is given on PI. 

 XXV, fig. 2. It is stated in the explanation of the plate to be the 

 same specimen as fig. 1, seen from above, and there is no reference to 

 any imperfection or restoration. It appears to show all the plates 

 of the ventral covering from the center of the summit to a long dis- 

 tance out upon the arms. In this figure, as in the preceding, there is 

 a complete absence of any regular plan of arrangement among the 

 plates forming the ventral part of the calyx. It would be impossi- 

 ble by any degree of imagination, to identify among them anything 

 like summit plates or covering pieces, the latter commencing beyond 

 the limits of the calyx. The plates are generally represented as no- 

 dose, and those toward the middle as the largest, but beyond this 

 there is nothing in the figure to distinguish any of them. 




868 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



It was Upon the information derived from these figures that we 

 based our conclusion — hasty as it may have been — that there were 

 two integuments in these genera, one above the other ; one representing 

 the perisorae containing the ambulacra^ the other a vault of irreg- 

 ular pieces, and to some degree pliable. 



We could not see how two such totally different structures as those 

 shown by PI. XVII, fig. 3a, and PI. VIII, fig. 6, could represent the 

 same elements in one and the same genus, and we therefore adopted 

 the idea of a double covering as the only solution we could find, al- 

 though after considerable hesitation, feeling that such an arrange- 

 ment was quite anomalous, and without a parallel elsewhere. We 

 were also influenced in no small degree by the fact that Prof Zittel, 

 who had the opportunity to see the Swedish collections, interpreted 

 the structures in a similar way.' 



We could not, of course, imagine that such magnificent figures as 

 are represented in Angelin's work^ in the absence of any esplana- 

 nation to that effect, could be wholly imaginary as to the most im- 

 portant parts of the structures illustrated. The fact is, however, as 

 we now know, that all these important figures are to a large extent 

 fictitious ; that the middle portions of them, where the summit plates 

 and covering pieces of the vault should have been found, were not 

 shown in the specimens at all, but were filled in by the artist accord- 

 ing to his own notion of their probable structure. 



The only specimen in the National Museum at Stockholm which 

 shows any part of the vault structure of Crotalocrinus, aside from 

 the original of fig. Sa, PI. XVII, has been sent to us for examination. 

 It is evidently the original from which fig. 7, PI. VIII was composed ; 

 for Dr. Lindstrom informs us that there is no other which can be 

 regarded as the type of that figure. It snows the lanceolate areas 

 alid covering plates along the arms beyond the calyx very well, but

2 It is but justice to the distinguished Swedish palaeontologist to remark that 

 his work on the Crinoids of Sweden was not complete at the time of his death. 

 His descriptions seem to be rather preliminary notes made for his own use, pre- 

 paratory to a more detailed study. These were collected after his death and 

 published, together with twenty-nine plates illustrating them, under the direction of 

 the Royal Academy of Sciences of Sweden. It is not strange under such circum- 

 stances there should be errors, and in pointing out some of them in this paper we 

 have no intention of discrediting a work which has been of great service to 

 palaeontology by bringing to notice one of the most magnificent crinoidal faunae 

 ever discovered. 




1888.] NATUEAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 369 



the middle is entirely broken away, leaving, however, partially in 

 place a few plates around the. anal opening. There is nothing in the 

 specimen from which the form and arrangement of the summit plates 

 could be even inferred. i. 



Of fig. 3a, PI. VII, Dr. Lindstrom writes : " The figure is not 

 correct. The central plates are totally wanting, as in all specimens 

 of EnaUoeriiius I have seen, and there are no vestiges left to infer 

 its true nature. There can be no satisfactory drawing made of it." 



Among the specimens sent us from Stockholm was one labeled 

 " VII 3, " which Ave suppose to be one of the originals from which 

 Angelin's PI. VII, fig. 3a, was in part deduced. We have figured 

 it to illustrate our descrij^tion of Enallocrinus (PI. XX, figs. Qa,h~), 

 and we learn that there are no other specimens of Enallocrinus 

 which show any more of the summit than this. 



As to fig. 2, PI. XXV, Dr. Lindstrom writes: "I cannot con- 

 ceive how such a drawing could have been executed out of it. The 

 upper side is so badly preserved that no good figure can be taken." 



The original of the splendid figure 6, PI. VIII — Crotalocrinus pul- 

 cher — which was from the Marklinean Museum at Upsala, cannot 

 be found, and we are therefore unable to give any particulars about 

 it. We have not the least doubt, however, that this figure, which is 

 stated to be enlarged (how much, we do not know), is even a greater 

 fiction than the others. In our own specimen of C. pvlcher from 

 Sweden (PI. XIX, figs, la, b, c), we succeeded in exposing enough 

 of the summit, while cleaning around the ventral tube, to show that 

 it is composed of covering pieces, interradials and summit plates, 

 just like the Cambridge specimen (PL XIX, fig. 3). 



These four figures, thus shown to be to a large extent incorrect and 

 misleading, were the ones on which we entirely relied in the statement 

 above quoted from Part III of the Revision. That statement was 

 critized by Dr. P. Herbert Carpenter in a paper " On the structure 

 of Crotalocrinus," in which he asserts, that " in their [our] statement 

 that ' there is no central piece, nor proximals, nor traces of ambulacra ' 

 in the figures of Crotalocrinus pulcher and Enallocrinus scriptus, they 

 appear to me to be seriously in error."^ 



It must be observed first, that in this portion of the paragraph 

 quoted, we were speaking solely of the vault proper, and not of the 

 rays and arms beyond the limits of the calyx. We distinctly 

 refer to the existence of " covering plates and side pieces to Avhich 



1 Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist., 1886, p. 339.

370 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



the interradials extend " (p. 19), and on page 143, in our diagnosis 

 of the Crotalocrinidae, we stated : " Ambulacral furrow deep, rami- 

 fying witli the arm branches, covered by alternating plates, and 

 bordered by side pieces." The ambulacra and covering pieces over 

 them, in the arms, which those figures all show, were therefore clear- 

 ly recognized by us always. 



It is worthy of note, however, that Carpenter, while pronouncing 

 us " seriously in error " in saying that there is no central piece, nor 

 proximals, nor traces of ambulacra in the figures of Angeliu above 

 referred to, does not undertake to point out the presence or location 

 of either one of those elements upon the figures in question, although 

 he expresses on p. 403 his belief " that the small covering plates of 

 Crotalocrimis rugosus are the representatives in a smaller crinoid^ 

 *of the large rigid plates' shown in figures 6 and 7, ^ ^ ^ ^ while 

 I shall also continue to believe, until the contrary is demonstrated, 

 that the central plate and proximals are among the irregular pieces 

 occupying the oral pole in the originals of these two figures." Nei- 

 ther does he inform us that the figures themselves are totally incor- 

 rect and fanciful, although at that time fresh from an examination 

 of the type specimens at Stockholm. 



Carpenter says (op cit. p. 399) that " while the summit plates are 

 clear and well defined in some species and genera, there are other 

 closely allied forms, in which these plates are almost or entirely un- 

 distiuguishable among the large number of plates to be found in the 

 vault. I will only mention one instance in illustration of this state- 

 ment, viz. Cyathocrinus ioivensis and C. multibrachiatus, both of 

 which are figured by Wachsmuth and Springer (Revision Part. Ill, 

 p. 65, PL IV, fig. 6, and PI. V, fig. 7), the former with, the latter 

 without any distinct summit plates. " 



These two figures, as the explanation shows, represent specimens 

 in which the summit plates were in an imperfect condition, indica.- 

 ting a process of resorption or modification going on, and were 

 expressly given for the purpose of illustrating this fact. The summit 

 plates, as we stated on page 49 (Rev. Pt. Ill), " are in their arrange- 

 ment, as a rule, very regular, and only disturbed by the anal tube." 

 We stated further on the same page that the apparent disturbance 

 in some species with a large number of arms was due to a misconcep- 

 tion of the plates. It is true that in some forms the summit plates 

 :are not so readily distinguished as in others, and there are some genera, 



* C. rugosus appears generally to be a much larger species than C. pulcher. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 371 



mostly Silurian, of different families, in which the vault is com2)osed 

 of an integument of innumerable minute pieces in which they are 

 undistinguishable, and, in our opinion, do not exist. But we know 

 of no other case of a vault composed of well defined and even 

 ornamented plates, in which in the same genus there was a total 

 absence of plan of arrangement in one species, and well defined 

 summit plates and covering pieces in another. It seemed to us 

 impossible that the summit plates and ambulacra, which Avere so 

 distinct and conspicuous in the one specimen, should be entirely absent 

 in another species of the same genus; and the only solution of the 

 mystery which we could arrive at, was that in the latter they must 

 be subtegminal, and that the covering of irregular pieces, shown in 

 the four figures above quoted, was broken away in the specimen 

 which exhibited the summit plates. * 



As we have said before, we had no opportunity to study the 

 Crotalocrinidae from actual specimens when we prepared the 

 Revision. It required but a single glance at the specimens from 

 Dudley and Gothland coming under our observation lately, to show 

 us that our conception of the structure and relations of Crotalocrinus, 

 and its congener, was completely erroneous, and that our views 

 respecting the subtegminal summit plates and double covering are 

 without foundation in the facts. AYe now renounce them altogether, 

 and all conclusions or arguments based upon the supposed existence 

 of these structures are hereby withdrawn. The same inspection of 

 specimens that disclosed to us our error, revealed with equal clear- 

 ness the real nature of those plates, and left not the least necessity 

 for inferring the existence of summit plates among the irregularly 

 arranged vaults of Angelin's restorations. 



While it is of course unpleasant to be obliged thus to correct 

 descriptions and repair arguments upon which we have laid consider- 

 able stress, we regret it in this case the less, because the result at 

 which _we have arrived regarding the systematic position of Orotalo- 

 onnus and Enallocrmus, confirms in a most satisfactory manner the 

 validity of the great groups which we have recognized as subdividing 



* The references to these figures in Part III of the Revision were unfort- 

 unately mixed up in the printing. They should be corrected as follows: on page 

 64, 7th line from bottom, for " PI. 6, " read " Fl. 8, " and for " figs. 15 and 25, " 

 read figs. 2 attd 75; " and in the 6th line from bottom, for "PI. 13," read " PL 

 8. " On p. 65, 6th line from top, for " PI 6, " read " PL 8. " We also misunder- 

 stood Angelin's fig. 15, PL 25, and Joh. Miillers' fig. 10, PI. 8, and our references 

 to them should therefore be ignored. 




372 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



the palaeozoic criuoids, and proves that, while the groups themselves 

 are entirely correct, our error consisted simply in a wrong under- 

 standing of the family, Avhich led us to assign it to a group to which 

 it does not belong. 



Let us now proceed to ascertain to what group Crotalocrinus 

 should be assigned. 



AVe established the suborder Articulata to include the group 

 defined by us under the fomily name Ichthyocrinidae with the addi- 

 tion of Crotalocrinus and Enallocrinus, (Revision III, p. 140). It is 

 clear from what we now know of their structure, that the two latter 

 cannot remain among the Articulata as that suborder has been 

 defined by us. * 



There is no doubt that Crotalocrinus possesses some characters 

 belonging to each of the three groups which we introduced in the 

 third part of the Revision. It resembles the Articulata in the peculiar 

 articulation of the arms. In the arrangement of some of its calyx 

 plates it bears a very close relation to the Inadunata, especially 

 Cyathocrinus, to which genus J. S. ]\Iiller referred it. Like that it 

 has three rings of plates, the upper one including a single anal plate. 

 A casual glance at the structures succeeding these would lead one to 

 think them somewhat similar to the unconnected rays of the Inadu- 

 nata, but a more careful study will show that they are constructed upon 

 the same principle as the same parts in some groups of the Camarata. 

 They are actually neither true radials nor free arm plates, but, as in 

 the Platycrinidae, represent a transition between them. As in Platy- 

 crinus there are but two primary radials, the upper one a small 

 triangular axillary, to both sides of which the secondary radials are 

 attached, resting both against its sloping sides and upon the first 

 radial. They ax'e overlaid by the tertiary radials, of which the lower 

 ones often, in a similar way, rest upon the secondary radials and the 

 first primary. 



All these plates, in a most peculiar and unique manner, are solidly 

 fitted together with each other and the first primary radial, and have 

 at their ventral face a wide, deep, diverging groove, arched by strong, 

 rigid covering plates, with a large tubular cavity underneath, which 

 in reality forms a part of the cavity of the calyx, like in the free 

 radial appendages in some forms of the Platycrinidae and Actino- 



* The actual discovery by us of the disk of Taxocrimis with an external 

 mouth, which we have elsewhere described, has settled all debate as to the summit 

 structure of the Ichthyocrinidae. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 373 



criniflae. The mode of insertion of the higher radials upon the first 

 primary is similar to that found in Pterotocrinus (PI. XIX, fig. 6), 

 and Marsupiocrinus (PI, XIX, fig. 7, and also Angelin's PI. XXII, 

 figs. 1, and 28, PL XXVII, fig. 4), and is upon the very same 

 principle that prevails in the Platycrinidae generally. 



A further striking resemblance to the Platycrinidae is to be 

 observed in the structure of the vault. We give for comparison fig- 

 ures of three of the most perfect vaults of Crotalocrinus ever found. 

 Fig. 4, on PI. XIX is from the Swedish specimen already described 

 as the original of Angelin's PI. XVII, fig. 3a. Fig. 3 is from a 

 specimen formerly in the Fletcher collection at Dudley, but now be- 

 longing to Cambridge University. It differs somewhat from the 

 others in the form of the four smaller orals, which are nearly equi- 

 lateral instead of clavate, and in having a few more interradials. 

 Fig. 2!L is from a Dudley specimen in our own collection. We can 

 see enough of the vault in our specimen of C. pulcher from Gothland 

 to show that it is built upon the same plan as in the three specimens 

 of C. rugosus illustrated, but it cannot be exposed sufficiently to affbrd 

 a good figure without mutilating the specimen more than is justi- 

 fiable. 



Taking all these facts together, the vault of Crotalocrinus seems 

 to have been composed of well developed oral plates (four proximals 

 and a central), large interradials, several anal plates, with anus in 

 form of a subcentral opening or a tube, and covering plates. The 

 latter are solidly inserted in the vault betiveen the other plates, so as 

 to form a part of the wall, contrary to the Inadunata, in which the 

 covering plates, and the ambulacra generally, rest npon the edges of 

 the other vault plates. 



Taking now for comparison the vault of 3fai'supiocrinus tennes- 

 seensis (PI. XIX,fig. 7), we find the same arrangement of orals; the 

 same solid covering pieces incorporated into, and forming part of the 

 vault, originating at the re-entering angles of the five orals, and pass- 

 ing outward to the arm bases ; we also find a system of interradial 

 and anal plates substantially like that of the Cambridge specimen of 

 Crotalocrinus (PI. XX, fig. 3). Indeed, if we had the vaults alone 

 of these two specimens under examination, it would not be a very 

 easy matter to point out why they might not belong to the same ge- 

 neric type. Certainly no one can look at the two figures, and not be 

 entirely convinced that they represent the same plan of summit 

 structure. And if we then compare the parts above the first radials 




374 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



in the two forms, there cannot be the slightest doubt that they be- 

 long to the same group, and that that group is the Camarata. It 

 might indeed be fairly said that the calyx of Crotalocrimis, in all 

 that determines its subordinal rank, is nothing more than a dicyclic 

 Marsupiocrinus. The mode of union of the plates in the dorsal cup 

 is also somewhat similar in the two genera. There are in both of 

 them along the suture lines small conical pits, which penetrate a 

 short distance inward but do not pass through the test (PI. XIX, fig. 

 •5) ; the inner half of the apposed faces is peculiarly striated, indicat- 

 ing a sort of syzygial union. On the other hand, the vast multipli- 

 cation of arms, with their lateral connection into a net-work, con- 

 stitutes a wide differentiation of this ty])e from any other group of 

 the Camarata, and is without a parallel among crinoids generally. 

 But this is a character which does not affect the fundamental plan 

 of structure, which unites it unquestionably with the Camarata. 



Another very i-emarkable character of this family is the perfora- 

 tion of the. higher radials and arm joints by a dorsal or axial canal, 

 which in the higher radials is very large, ramifying to the arms, and 

 in Crotalocrinus extends to their extremities. The canals of each 

 ray unite into one on the inner surfixce of the first radials, and pass 

 downward toward the base. This perforation, and the fact that the 

 arm joints are united also by muscles instead of ligaments only, dis- 

 tinguishes the family sharply from all other Camarata. It was this 

 mainly that led us to place them among the Articulata not knowing 

 the solid structure of the vault. The arms in this group must 

 have possessed a high degree of flexibility, being found sometimes 

 closely folded together lengthwise, often spread out horizontally — 

 even dropping over the calyx — and sometimes compactly inrolled 

 for a considerable distance from the ends, as shown in our figure (PI. 

 XIX, fig. la). 



There is one point in Crotalocrimis which is not clear to us, and 

 on which our specimens do not seem to throw- much light. Johannes 

 Miiller^ gives the following description of the ventral structure of 

 the arms. " Dieser Canal [speaking of the ventral furrow along the 

 the arm joints] ist queriiber von kleinen Pliittchen verdeckt, welche 

 meist alternirend in einander greifen. Zu den Seiten stehen auf der 

 Volarseite der Glieder, die Ambulacra einfassend, ausserst zarte 

 Pinnuhie oder schmale Saumplattchen, von denen mehrere (3-4) 

 auf die Liinge eines Gliedes kommen. Diese Pinnulae sind unge-

gliedert, nur an der Basis scheint sich zuweilen ein Stiickchen 

 abzusetzen. Die Hohe der Pinuulae gleiclit am breiteren Theil der 

 Hand der Dicke der Glieder," 



In the specimens which we have examined, the small alternating 

 ■ plates which cover the ventral furrow are very plainly seen, but we 

 find no trace of the so-called "pinnules or saumplattchen," which 

 were figured and described by Miiller and Angelin. It is evident 

 that the alternating inner plates, covering the ventral furrow, are 

 the "smcmpldttchen" or covering pieces, and not the ottfer ones along 

 the lateral margins of the furrow, which, if they exist at all, proba- 

 bly are ad-ambulacral plates ; they cannot be pinnules in the ordi- 

 nary sense, for there are, according to Miiller, 3 to 4 to each arm- 

 joint. In one of our specimens (PI, XIX, figs, la, 6), high up along 

 the arms, the covering plates are perfectly seen in place, and there 

 appear at their sides in some places, along the margin of the furrows, 

 what seem like serrated edges, several to a joint, and it may be that 

 jSIiiller and Angelin took these edges, which rise somewhat above 

 the level of the covering plates, for pinnules. If these are the struct- 

 ures figured by Miiller and Angelin (Bau. d. Echinod. PL VIII, figs. 

 7 and 8; and Icon. Crin. Suec, PI. XXV, figs. 19, 19a), then the 

 projecting parts are mostly broken away in our specimens, and in all 

 others we have seen. 



The arms of the species named by Miiller Anthocrmus Loveni — 

 but which Angelin considered to be a synonym of Crotalocrimis 

 pidcher — were described by him as resembling the five leaves of a 

 flower, which when spread out would not connect, but when closed 

 were folded up, and overlapped each other. It is possible that this 

 is the case in that species, and in fact his cross-section ( Op. cit. PL 

 VIII, fig. 4) clearly indicates it. But we have had before us three 

 specimens from Sweden and one from England, considered to be 

 C. rugosus, all having the arms completely spread, in some cases 

 bending downward, and in these the arms are certainly in lateral 

 contact, not only within the rays, but continuously all around. Also 

 the cross-section of the arms of this species, given in ]\Iurchison's 

 Siluria (3rd Ed. p. 247, fig. 4a), shows the continuous connection of 

 the arms, and how they fold in upon themselves when closed. The 

 specimen figured in PL XX, fig. 4, which, in our opinion, is not G. 

 rugosris but an undescribed species, represents a form in which the 

 rays may have been disconnected as in C.pulcher. It differs widely 

 from both species in the first radials, which are excavated and have 




376 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



large, limb-like projections, deeply incurved between the bases of tbe 

 rays. This form which occurs also at Dudley, associated with C. 

 Tugosus, is usually labeled as such in collections. 



The reticulate arm structure, which distinguishes Crotalocrmus 

 from all other criiioids, is its most interesting character. The arms 

 are deeper (from the dorsal to the ventral side) than they are wide, 

 they extend to a great length, and bifurcate just often enough, and 

 at such intervals in C. rugosus, to fill up the spaces necessary to form 

 a complete circle with the arms in lateral contact out to the periph- 

 ery, and the number of branches in the adult specimen, when perfect 

 must have been enormous. In our specimen of C. rugosus (PI. XIX, 

 fig. ]), at the height of the fifteenth joint, there are forty rami to 

 each ray, and this is not moi*e than one third their full length, so 

 that the number of ultimate divisions would amount in this speci- 

 men to at least five or six hundred. The joints at the same height 

 are of the same length, and the sutures are in the same line all 

 around, so that they form regular concentric circles. Each joint has 

 two lateral projections given off from the middle part of each side, 

 which meet with those of adjacent branches, forming points of union 

 by which the arms are connected throughout, but leaving open 

 spaces or meshes which produce the reticulate appearance. The arms 

 of Enalloerinus resemble those of Crotalocrinus in their mode (."f bi- 

 furcation and extraordinary length, but are not connected laterally 

 except for a few of the lower joints. They have, however, frequent- 

 ly, if not always, lateral projections along the joints on each side, and 

 hence possess the cross-shaped arm joints of Crotalocrinus (PI. XIX, 

 fig. 6Li'). The sutures between the joints are also in the same line, 

 and do not alternate as we formerly supposed. 



The mode of insertion of the higher radials upon the first radial 

 is very peculiar, and has not hitherto been understood. We might 

 have still remained in ignorance about it, had it not been for the 

 fortunate discovery among our Dudley specimens of an isolated first 

 radial with the succeeding radials attached, so that we could see 

 them from all sides (PI. XX, fig. 4). By the aid of this, and a 

 very interesting, much weathered specimen, loaned us by Dr. 

 Lindstrom, we are enabled to describe and illustrate the position of 

 these parts quite satisfactorily. The plates from the second radial 

 \x]i are of considerable size, but they are not always visible on the 

 dorsal side. In C. pulcher they are plain enough (PL XX, fig. 1), 

 but in C. rugosus they often appear as mere points or thin edges 




1888.] NATURAL SCIE>X'ES OF PHILADELPHIA. 377 



(PI. XX, rig. 2!.). The other ends emerge upon the ventral side, 

 where they present a considerable surface, containing a large ambu- 

 lacral groove. In order to attain this position, the plates, which are 

 wedge-shaped, bend inward and upward until their opposite ends 

 stand nearly at right angles to each other, and the arms at their 

 origin pass out in a horizontal position. This can be seen in fig. 21 

 PL XIX, which represents a vertical section, giving a side view of 

 the same succession of plates as is shown dorsally by fig. 21, and 

 ventrally by fig. 21 on the same plate. The successive pieces are 

 numbered in each figure to correspond, and by comparing them., 

 and remembering that they present three different views of the same 

 elements, we think there will be no difficulty in understanding them. 

 We cannot see the least evidence of mobility of these plates until 

 they become free from the first radial, and thus attain the rank of 

 arm plates. Whenever the arms are found folded up, the bending 

 from a horizontal to a vertical position takes place in the lower 

 arm plates, and not in the higher radials. The lanceolate areas, 

 which are such a conspicuous feature of the ventral surface, and 

 extend from the second axillary to the fifth or sixth bifurcations, 

 are formed by a great thickening along the outer edges of the 

 marginal plates of two adjacent rays, and therefore consist of two 

 rows of arm plates, respectively radials, decreasing in width in their 

 upward arrangement. 



The anus is excentric, and in C. pulcher takes the form of a large 

 tube, while in all authentic specimens of C. rugosus it seems to be a 

 simple opening. The form and position of the tube have been 

 wrongly described by us. Angeliu's beautiful looking figure, pur- 

 porting to show it to its full length (Icon. Crin. Suec, PI. XVII, 

 fig. 1), originating at the edge of the calyx, and lying outside the 

 arms, proves to be an ideal figure, based upon the erroneous inter- 

 pretation of some fragmentary pieces. Our specimen (PI. XX, fig. 

 11) shows the base of the tube very well, but not its full length. To 

 judge from the fragments, shown by Angelin's PI. XXV, figs. 8 — 

 13, it must have been of considerable length in some specimens. It 

 seems to have been somewhat more highly organized than the anal 

 tube of the Camarata generally, and to approach the ventral sac of 

 the Fistulata. The actual length has not been observed, but from 

 the manner in which the large cavity within tapers in diflferent speci- 

 mens, we have no doubt that the opening is at the upper end, and 




378 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



repi'esents a true anal tube, whatever other function it may have 

 possessed. Nothing is known of the anal opening of Enallocrhins. 



We give herewith new definitions of the Crotalocrinidae and their 

 two genera Crotalocrinus and Enallocrinus, to take the place of 

 those given by us in the Revision, Part III, p. 14-3, and pp. 147 — 

 152, and we request all who may be using the Revision to substitute 

 them at once. 



We now direct attention to another point of considerable interest 

 which has been developed by this investigation, A very perplex- 

 ing figure was given by Angelin (PL XVII, fig. 2b), and a some- 

 what similar one by Murchison (Siluria, 3rd Ed., p. 247, fig. 5)^ 

 which show certain extensions apparently from the inner rim of the 

 first radials, and which superficially resemble the so-called "consoli- 

 dating apparatus" of Cupressocrinus. A closer examination of 

 Angelin's figure shows these extensions to be composed of small 

 plates ; both figures, however, are misleading, for our specimens- 

 show that the plates forming those extensions do not rest against 

 the inner edges of the first radials as represented, but upon their 

 upper faces, as correctly shown in Angelin's PI. XVII, fig. 2a. 

 They are nothing but the exposed ventral surfaces of the second 

 primary and succeeding radials, the elevations being the projecting- 

 margins along the ambulacral grooves. Neither do they extend so 

 far inward as would seem from Angelin's figure, they project in- 

 ward only for a short distance, and form underneath a surface of at- 

 tachment for certain organs hereafter described. 



Miiller described and figured correctly (Op. cit. p. 189, PL VIII, 

 fig. 5), the inward curvature of the plates, but we cannot agree with 

 him in his statement that by means of this curvature a roofing is- 

 formed over the periphery of the calyx. This is not confirmed by 

 the specimens, in which the calyx is covered by summit plates, in- 

 terradials, etc., and the grooves around the periphery are roofed over 

 by solid covering plates — leaving onl} the lateral margins exposed 

 — in connection with, and forming part of the calicular cavity. The 

 structure is clearly seen in our fig. 1!., PL XIX, in which the grooves 

 are shown open except in one ray, where the covering plates are 

 restored from the same part in another specimen. 



Another figure of Angelin (Tab. VII., fig, 7a) gives an inner 

 view — that is, from below ; not ^'superne visus," as erroneously stated 

 in the explanation of the plate — of a specimen of C. pulcher of 

 which he speaks as showing the so-called "consolidating apparatus." 




1888.] NATURAL SCIEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 379 



Carpenter in his paper on Crotalocrinus^ explains that "the calyx is 

 broken across near the level of the top of the basals, so that the inter- 

 nal faces of the radials and the following plates are exposed to view, 

 with the remarkable striations upon them, which were regarded by 

 Angelin as corresponding to the consolidating apparatus of Cujyress- 

 ocriniis," and he proceeds : "It is possible that, like this structure, 

 they may represent an uneven surface for the attachment of muscles 

 and ligameniJs, but whatever else they may be, the strise are certain- 

 ly not hydrospire slits, as supposed by Wachsmuth and Springer in 

 1879 * =i= '-i^ =!«. But in any case they will no longer be able to re- 

 fer to this family as Palseocrinoids which 'probably have hydro- 

 spires within the calyx,' and to use this supposed fact as an illustra- 

 tion of their theory that Blastoids, Cystids and Crinoids are so close- 

 ly linked together that they are not entitled to rank as Classes of 

 Echinoderms equivalent to the Urchins and Starfishes." 



We have been able to study the organs in question in our speci- 

 men from Gothland (PI. XIX, fig. 1), and in two of those used by 

 Angelin, loaned to us from the National Museum of Stockholm, in 

 all of which they are very well shown. They are totally different 

 structures from the so-called consolidating apparatus of Cupresso- 

 crinus, which we regard as muscle plates for the attachment of 

 muscles and ligaments to move its huge arms. The muscle plates 

 of Cupressocrinus are appendages of the first radials, and form part 

 of the upper surface of the vault, similar to the muscle plates of 

 Symbathocrimis, in which we know from direct observation that they 

 constitute parts of the vault, only the central space being closed by 

 additional plates. In both genera those plates are apposed by cor- 

 responding faces upon the first brachials, and there is no roof or 

 covering of any kind above them, they being necessarily external if 

 they served for places of muscular attachment to move the arms. 

 The case is totally different in Crotalocrlnus in which the parts in 

 question are roofed over by very solid covering plates, leaving little 

 more than the foces forming the lanceolate areas exposed. Angelin 

 applies the name "consolidating apparatus" not only to the over- 

 hanging margins of the radials, but also to the lamellae under- 

 neath, to which Carpenter refers as "remarkable striations," possi- 

 bly for "the attachment of muscles and ligaments." These so-call- 

 ed striations consist of parallel lamellose walls or partitions, located 

 in regular sets within chambers or recesses, which underlie partly 



1 Op. cit, p. 406. 




380 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



the overhanging margins of the higher radials constituting the 

 lanceolate areas, partly the outermost interradial, and are limited on 

 either side by the inward extensions of the second and succeeding 

 radials. There are two sets of these lamellae to each interradius, 

 those of adjacent rays meeting laterally and entering the same 

 chamber where they are closely connected ; while those of the same 

 ray stand at an angle from each other, and are apparently disconnect- 

 ed except by a mere point. Each set is composed of 'five to seven 

 folded lamellfe, with continuous walls forming loops at each end. 

 They stand upright, and seem to be attached at their lower ends to 

 the inner surface of the first radials, and those in the same ray come 

 together by their upper ends at a small angle under the small trian- 

 gular second radial, where it projects farthest inward. The upper 

 ends are further attached along the inner walls of the higher radials 

 and the outer inter radials, underneath which the two adjacent sets 

 meet by parallel plates and form a close connection. The arrange- 

 ment at the anal side is not clearly shown in any of the specimens. 

 In Enallocrlnus we have not been able to discover anything of the 

 lamella), but we had for examination but a solitary specimen show- 

 ing the interior of the calyx. There are seen, however, the same 

 chambered spaces in which they might rest, and we have little doubt 

 they existed in that genus also. Their position and structure in 

 Crotalocrinus rugosiis are shown in our figures 11 and 1!L on Plate 

 XIX. 



From our description it must be clear that these laminated struct- 

 ures do not possess any of the characteristics of muscle-plates. Their 

 position in paired sets is interradial ; they are completely internal, 

 and have no visible connection with the arms, nor do they present 

 any surface for the attachment of muscles or ligaments; but on the 

 contrary are very frail structures, having in some places little parti- 

 tions connecting the walls, and giving the whole a somewhat porous 

 appearance. On the other hand if we compare them with the hydro- 

 spires in the Blastoid genus Orophocrinus, one cannot help being 

 struck with the resemblance in form, position and arrangement. We 

 will not assert unqualifiedly that they are hydrospires, but Ave are 

 very confident that they are not muscle-plates, nor anything of that 

 nature, and if they are not of the same character as the similar 

 organs in Orophocrinus, which have been universally considered to 

 be hydrospires, then we must acknowledge ourselves completely at a 

 loss for anything in echinoderm morj^hology with which to compare 




1888.] >'ATUEAL SCIEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 381 



them. There is nothing else like them in any known crinoid. If 

 they are hydrospires, then they certainly do aiford a strong illustra. 

 tion of the close alliance between Blastoids, Cystids and Crinoids. If 

 they are not hydrospires, we should like to know what they are. 



Enallocrinus is evidently very closely allied to Crotalocrinus. The 

 genus occurs at Dudley, England, whence we obtained specimens 

 showing the arms better than the Swedish ones, but nevertheless our 

 material for the study of this type was by no means so satisfactory 

 as that of Crotalocrinxhs. The English specimens are all more or 

 less crushed, and do not throw much light on the structure of the 

 calyx. 



Angelin's figures purporting to show the vault are imaginary, as 

 we have before shown. The only specimen in the Stockholm Muse- 

 um showing any part of the ventral covering has been sent to us for 

 examination, and we give two views of it (PI. XX, figs 5 ti^). It 

 is somewhat abnormal, two of the rays being grown together in 

 such a way as to modify the arrangement of some of the plates. It 

 is one of the specimens from which it is supposed Angelin's figure 

 3a, PI. VII was constructed. The insertion of the higher radials 

 upon the first radials is upon the same plan as in Crotalocrinus, es- 

 pecially the species shown by Angelin's PI. XVII, fig. 3a, and our 

 PI. ^X, fig. 4, and from this, and what little we can see of the ventral 

 covering in the specimen above alluded to, we conclude that the 

 vault must have been constructed substantially like that of Crotalo- 

 crinus. 



We figure a flattened specimen from Dudley (PI. XX, fig. 61), 

 which shows the arrangement and bifurcations of the arms, but not 

 by any means to their full length. We have another set of arms 

 which seem to have their filiform extremities nearly complete, and 

 from this we should infer that the specimen we have figured shows 

 but little over half the length of the arms. Figs. 61 and 61 illus- 

 trate the projections from the sides of the joints, in the same speci- 

 men. We consider them important characters, perhaps representing 

 the projections on the arms of Crotalocrinus, and indicating a tend- 

 ency toward the reticulate arm structui'e, which is the only well 

 marked distinction between the two genera. 



The specimen represented by Angelin's PI. XV, figs. 1, la, and 2, 

 as Enallocrinus assulosus, and which Dr. Lindstrom assures us is 

 correctly figured, represents in the reduced lateral connection of the 

 arm bases, and the presence of small interradials on the dorsal side. 




382 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



a considerable departure from the ty])ical form of the genus. It is 

 inconsistent with the generic definition of Angelin, who described it 

 as having ^'interradialia nulla.'" It is a variation in the direction 

 of the English form of Marsiqnocrinus — M. eoelatus — (PI. XX, fig. 

 7), which diflfers in its dorsal interradials from 31. tennesseensis in al- 

 most the same way. 



Crotalocrinus and Enallocrinus form a good family, which is con- 

 nected through 3Iarsupiocrimis ^ w^ith the other Camarata. 

 Suborder CAMARATA. 



Family CROTALOCRINIDAE. 



Base dicyclic, symmetry bilateral. Calyx throughout composed 

 of rigid plates. Dorsal cup constructed almost exclusively of under- 

 basals, basals, the first radials, and a small anal plate. Higher 

 radials up to the third or fourth order irregularly wedge-shaped, 

 their sharp ends directed outwards or sometimes hidden from view, 

 their larger ends, which curve upwards, grooved for the ambulacra. 

 The plates rest partly upon the first radials, partly against the radials 

 of the preceding order, being with the former, and with one another, 

 and laterally with those of adjoining rays, firmly united by suture. 

 Arms capable of great mobility ; uniserial ; long ; dividing into very 

 numerous branches, which are free, or connected laterally by tis- 

 sues so as to form a net-work around the calyx, either continuous, or 

 limited to the rays and forming five reticulate leaf-like arms. The 

 arm branches ai-e perforated by large axial canals, which penetrate 

 also the higher radials. 



Ventral surface of calyx flat, composed of five unequal orals — the 

 posterior one the larger — five radial dome plates, one or more inter-

Generic diagnosis. 



When the arms are closed the crinoid resembles an elongate bud 

 with folded leaves ; when these are spread, it is wheel shaped, with 

 five lanceolate areas between the bases of the rays. Calyx sub- 

 globose, flattened above. 



Underbasals 5, large, pentangular, of uniform size. Basals 5, very 

 large, extending three fourths the height of the calyx, all hexagonal 

 except the posterior one, which is higher and has the upper angle 

 truncated for the reception of a comparatively small, quadrangular 

 anal plate, which rests between the first radials. 



First radials much wider than high, their distal faces thickened, 

 either concave or straight, and occupied by small, shallow depres- 

 sions for the reception of the second and higher radials, which to the 

 third or fourth order rest partly upon this plate. The second radial 

 occupies a very small space at the middle of the first, where it ap- 

 pears as a small, trigonal bifurcating plate, sometimes scarcely visible 

 dorsally. From its dorsal or outer side to its ventral side, the plate 

 is very long and slender, bent upwards almost to a right angle, so as 

 to bring the face opposite to that exj^osed dorsally into a horizontal 

 position, and on a level with the vault. The secondary radials rest 

 against the sloping faces of the second primary, and upon the first ; 

 they are bifurcating plates, and as such support immediately the ter- 




384 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



tiary radials, Avhich in C. riigosus, sometimes together with the first 

 plate of the fourth order, rest partly upon the first radial. All of 

 these jilates, in various 'O'ays, are firmly attached to the first radial, 

 and united suturally with one another, and all of them, by curving 

 upwards and inwards, extend from the dorsal to the ventral surface 

 of the calyx, forming as such a sort of transition between true radi- 

 als and arm plates, in a similar manner as the higher radials of the 

 Platycrinidae, which they resemble in their arrangement. The plates 

 are wedge-form, thinning out toward the dorsal cup, where they are 

 seen as mere points or lines, or one or more of them are invisible al- 

 together. Their larger upper laces, which are exposed ventrally, are 

 deeply grooved for the reception of the ambulacra, and, when the 

 covering plates are in position are only partly exposed. The plates 

 above the fourth order are not in contact with the first radials, and 

 may be regarded as true arm-plates, which they resemble in form 

 and in point of mobility. 



The arms are long and bi-anch frequently ; they are connected lat- 

 erally by points of attachment from near the middle of each joint, 

 with open spaces between them, forming together a sort of network 

 around the calyx with innumerable elongate meshes. In C. rugosus 

 the network is continuous around the calyx, but in C. pulcher the 

 rays are separated, and form five broad reticulate leaves, which, when 

 closed over the calyx, overlap each other, contrary to the case of C. 

 rugosus in which the undivided network is closely plicated and fold- 

 ed. The lower plates of the rays, to the third or fourth order, are 

 immovably connected among each other and with the first radials ; 

 but higher up in the rays, where the plates are no longer in contact 

 with the first radials, an articulation by strong muscles and fossse 

 takes the place of suture. The arm joints, owing to their lateral pro- 

 jections, have the form of a cross with short arms : they are long flat 

 on the dorsal surfiice, laterally compressed, with straight sides, and 

 deeply grooved on the ventral surface for the reception of the am- 

 bulacra. 



The ambulacral furrows are arched by covering pieces, 3 to 4 

 to each side of the arm joint, alternately arranged. The arm 

 joints are disposed in regular dichotomizing longitudinal rows, 

 as well as in regular concentric transverse rows, the points of union 

 occupying the same line all around. Each arm plate is pierced with 

 a very large dorsal canal, and the bifurcating ones with two, which 

 meet in the middle of the plate ; they ramify to the ends of the arms. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 385 



and all converge into one in the second radials, thence passing down- 

 ward along the inner surftice of" the first radials toward the basals. 

 The bifurcations near the calyx are unequal, the sloping faces of the 

 axillaries next the outer margins of the rays being considerably 

 wider than the inner ones, and the plates which they support are as 

 large in proportion. This continues on to about the sixth axillary, 

 above which the bifurcations gradually become regular, and the 

 outer plates attain the same width as the inner ones. By this peculiar 

 arrangement there appear, when the arms are spread, along the outer 

 plates of adjacent rays, five well marked lanceolate areas, to the top 

 of which the rays remain in lateral contact. The bifurcations along 

 the arms are extremely numerous, and take place at various inter- 

 vals, sufficient to fill up the full segments of the circle when the arms 

 are extended ; they taper but slightly, are very long, and become 

 thread-like at the ends. 



The higher radials from the first primary up project inwards, beyond 

 the periphery of the calyx ; the second projects the farthest, and the 

 plates of the second order slope away from it, as also those of the 

 third. The latter form the proximal ends of the lanceolate areas 

 whose overhanging margins, together with the outermost interradial, 

 form a roof, under which are located five large recesses or chambers, 

 interradial in position, each of which is occupied by two sets of lami- 

 nated structures, in form and arrxingement closely resembling the 

 hydrospires of the Blastoid genus Orophocrinus. Each set apparently 

 is composed of five to seven folded lamellae with continuous walls 

 and loops at each end ; they stand upright, face laterally the inner 

 walls of the overhanging primary radials, their upper ends attached 

 to the inner floor of the outer interradial, being thus completely 

 covered by vault structures. 



Vault flat, on a level with the spreading arms ; composed of five 

 oi'al plates (the so-called central plate and the four large proximals). 

 The posterior oral (central plate) is large, somewhat elongate, its an- 

 terior end resting between the truncate faces of the four others, the 

 posterior end againt small anal plates. The four small orals vary 

 from elongate-clavate (PI. XX, figs 2^ and 4) to almost regularly 

 hexagonal (PI. XX, fig. 3). Outside the orals, and alternating with 

 them, are five somewhat irregular radial plates, which are axillary, 

 giving off two sets of covering pieces, two rows of plates to each set, 

 all in lateral contact ; they are heavy, convex plates, a little wider 

 than high, alternately arranged, and solidly inserted into the vault.

Between the covering plates, and abutting against tlie four smaller 

 orals, are two or more interradials, the inner ones the larger. Be- 

 tween the radial-dome-plates, and against the large posterior oral, 

 are numerous small anal plates which embrace the anus, and of 

 which the outer ones face the anal plate of the dorsal cup. The anus 

 is excentric, and its form varies among species, being either extended 

 into a tube, or placed at the top of a small protuberance. The tube 

 apparently reached considerable length, and seems to have been 

 composed of several rows of transverse pieces longitudinally ar- 

 ranged, with a large octagonal cavity. 



Column very large ; terminating in numerous rootlets. Canal 

 large, round.

Generic Diagnosis. — Calyx similar in fi^rni and construction to 

 that of Crotalocrinus', interradials sometimes appearing dorsally. 

 Arms not reticulate. 



First radials wide, their distal faces usually occupied by a deep 

 lunate excavation in which the second primary and one or two higher 

 radials rest ; sometimes, however, truncate. Second primary and 

 higher radials inserted and connected as in Crotalocrinus, curving 

 upward and appearing on the ventral side in a similar w^ay. Rays 

 completely disconnected from the first radials up, and the arms be- 

 coming free variously between the first to the fourth bifurcation. 

 Second radials perforated by a large axial canal which passes down- 

 ward ; it ramifies within the higher radials, and passes into the 

 arms, but apparently does not extend to their full length. 



Arms uniserial, very long, tapering little, bifurcating at lengthen- 

 ing intervals toward the upper parts into very numerous equal 

 branches, the ultimate divisions being extremely attenuate; the arms 

 capable of being spread out horizontally. Arm joints shorter than 

 in Crotalocrinus, with parallel sutures; those of adjacent branches 




388 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



opposite each other not alternating. Toward the upper ends of the 

 arm joints there are more or less conspicuous transverse projections 

 — one from each side of the joint — which are more prominent and 

 elongate at the ventral side. They border the arm furrow, and give 

 to the arm, when viewed from the side, a pectinate appearance, 

 which is more strongly marked toward the distal ends of the arms 

 (PL XX, figs f)*'"). Ambulacral furrows shallow, with covering 

 plates arranged in the usual way. ^ 



Vault apparently similar to that of Crotalocrinus ; median part 

 unknown ; ambulacra toward the periphery roofed over by convex 

 alternating pieces having the form of vault plates, which pass out 

 over the arms. Aual opening unknown. 



Column round, very large, with short joints and thin walls; canal 

 round and of extremely large size.

1 We have observed these projections on the arms only in the English specimens. 

 We give it as a generic character, as we think it likely the Swedish ones will show 

 it also when suflSciently well preserved ; and because we consider it of some im- 

 portance, as representing the projections on the arms of Crotalocrbius by which 

 these were connected, and thus exhibiting a tendency toward the reticulate struct- 

 ure.

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE LIFE HISTORIES OF PLANTS. No. III. 

 BY THOMAS MEEHAN. 



Smilacina bifolia. Observing in a large tract of Smilacin a bifolia 

 that the leaves were for the most part at a very light angle, indeed 

 almost vertical, it seemed to afford a good opportunity to test a 

 prevalent idea that, in such ca&es, the stomata are nearly equal in 

 numbers on each surface of the leaf Dr. J. B. Brinton kindly made 

 a careful microscopical examination of some leaves I furnished him 

 Avith, but he found no difference in this respect to leaves with a 

 purely horizontal direction. On a small section, of which he hands 

 me a drawing, there was only one stoma on the upper surface, 

 while there were fifteen on the under surface. 



Dichogamy and its significance. Dichogamy has reference to the 

 relative period of maturity of stamen and pistil. When the stamens 

 are in the advance the flowers nre said to be proterandrous ; when the 

 pistil is mature before the stamens, the flower is proterogynous. Usu- 

 ally the term is employed in connection with hermaphrodite flowers. 

 But as it is a mere question of the time required for the development of 

 the sexual organs necessary to the perfecting of a complete individual, 

 it is obvious that we may extend the term so as to include monoecious 

 and dioecious plants. 



The law under which the separate sexual organs are retarded in 

 their growth in some instances and accelerated in others, cannot 

 but have supreme importance in the study of vegetable biology. If 

 we can trace the working of this law in tlie hermaphrodite flower to 

 the extent of acceleration or retardation for but a single day, we can 

 easily get to understand how some plants may come to have the 

 maturity of these orgaus days apart, and to finally divide into 

 monoecious or dioecious classes. 



Among the contributions I have made to botanical science, few 

 impress me with more importance than the determination of the fact 

 that a degree or measure of heat capable of exciting the male organs 

 to growth, may yet be wholly inadequate to start growth in the 

 female (see Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences 1885, jo. 

 117.) 



I observed that the aments of walnuts, hazel-nuts and .similar 

 plants were often perfected weeks and occasionally months before 

 the female flowers were in conditon to receive pollen, and that it 




392 PEOCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



was only in seasons when the stamens and pistils matured simulta- 

 neously, that large crops of nuts followed. I had overlooked at that 

 time, the fact that something similar had been placed on record be- 

 fore. In the Transactions of the Horticultural Society of London, 

 vol. V, 1824, is a paper by Rev. George Swayne, showing that the 

 filbert crop in Kent fails two years out of five ; that some seasons 

 the catkins mature before the female flowers open, and at others not 

 till afterwards, and that failure to produce a crop results from the 

 absence of pollen at the period when the female flower is in receptive 

 condition. All I can, therefore, claim as original is the formula that 

 varying measures of heat influence variously the separate sexes, — 

 the smaller measure influencing the male, while the female still con- 

 tinues to rest. 



Since my observations were made on the hazel, I have extended 

 them to other plants. It has long been known that in many of the 

 Central States coniferous trees that produce seeds abundantly farther 

 north, rarely have one perfect seed in those regions. I know this is 

 so in the vicinity of Philadelphia. The Norway spruce may pro- 

 duce cones by the cart-load, with not an ounce of seed in the lot. 

 Since the observations above cited I find that the male flowers ma- 

 ture long before the female, and affords a satisfactory reason for the 

 failure. Further north, where winter does not coquette with spring 

 as here, they remain in rest equally, and advance together. In their 

 gregarious, forest condition, no doubt the extent of surface conduces 

 to an eq^ilibrial condition of climate not surrounding isolated trees 

 in a cultivated state. 



In brief, I may enumerate a number of conifer*, alders, walnuts, 

 chestnuts, oaks, hickories and the hazel-nut as among those that I 

 carefully watched for the few years past, noting a wide range of 

 difference each season between the times of maturing of the male 

 and female flowers. The season of 1887-8, I noticed was favorable 

 to a simultaneous maturity of the sexes. I exhibited specimens in 

 the spring of 1888, to the Botanical Section of the Academy, and 

 had no difliculty in predicating on the fact of simultaneity an 

 abundant harvest of nuts, which has been fully realized. I have 

 since been observing the working of this principle in elms and 

 maples — hermaphrodite plants ; the species under observation being 

 Ulmus americana, and Acer dasycarpum. The trees of the former 

 were comparatively young, but had flowered the first three years 

 without j^erfecting more than a seed here and there. I had no 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 393 



difficulty in perceiving in these elms and maples in the spring of 

 1887, that the pollen had been dispersed weeks before the pistil was 

 mature. The past season (1888) examination showed the anthers 

 bursting simultaneously with the receptive conditions. There was 

 an abundant crop of seeds. The maple is usually inclined to dicecism. 

 Although the flowers may seem perfect, the stamens in some fertile 

 flowers never proceed beyond anthers that give no pollen, while in 

 other cases perfect stamens with filaments and fertile anthers are 

 produced, when the gynoecium seems unable to fulfil its functions. 

 But the elm, at least here, seems a full hermaphrodite, yet only this 

 season of three successive ones, had it full hermaphrodite functions. 

 In the two first it was so very proterandrous as to be barren. It 

 was not proterandrous this year, though I cannot say it was pro- 

 terogynous. It was, in fact as well as in name, hermaphrodite. 



Surely I am warranted in presenting the formula, that varying 

 measures of temperature variously affect the separate sexual organs, 

 and that the dichogamy has its origin in this simple circumstance. 



It is interesting to note how near we may get to a great truth 

 without actually perceiving it till long afterwards. In 1868, I 

 announced, through the Proceedings of the Academy, my discovery 

 that M'dchelki repens was not merely heterostyled but practically 

 dioecious. I had subsequently found a white-berried variety which 

 bore berries freely Avhen surrounded by its companions, but I never 

 had one during the many years it was under culture in my 

 garden. Up to that time and subsequently, the course of these 

 phenomena was obscure. jNIr. Darwin, in Forms of Floioers (Chap. 

 VII), observes: " But according to Mr. Meehan Mitcliella itself is 

 dioecious in some districts. * * * Should these statements be 

 confirmed, Mitcliella will be proved to be heterostyled in one district 

 and dioecious in another." With our present light we can readily 

 see how this may easily be. 



Now what is the significance of dichogamy ? The general view at 

 the present time is substantially the same as given in the work 

 above quoted. There Darwin expresses it in these words : " Va- 

 rious hermaphrodite plants have become heterostyled, and now ex- 

 ist under two or three forms ; and we may confidently believe that 

 this has been effected in order that cross-fertilization should be as- 

 sured." 



With the new light I have thrown on the origin of dichogamy, I 

 am sure the great Darwin would be ready to modify this view. It 

 cannot have the sia-nificance we all thought it had at that time. 




394 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



We now see that a plant may find itself in a climate or in sur- 

 roundings favorable to an early development of stamens ; in anoth- 

 er case in a locality or country where the reverse will prevail. 

 Dichogamy will then vary. We also know that heredity plays a 

 part in fixing a constantly recurring local tendency, so that a plant 

 having acquired a tendency to proterandy or it may be to proter- 

 ogyny, would continue to carry the habit long after the superinduc- 

 ing causes had passed away. Plants remaining for ages in a local- 

 ity where the conditions Avould be favorable to a wide difl^erence 

 between simultaneity, would probably become in time monoecious 

 or dioecious, and all this, as we see, from no particular assurance 

 that cross-fertilization would thereby be affected. 



In trying to reach generalizations of this character, we should 

 not, however, forget that in nature, things seldom follow from a 

 single cause, but from the operation of united forces. In this con- 

 nection I have shown, (see Proceedings of the American Association 

 for the Advancement of Science, Salem, and subsequent meetings,) that 

 sex itself is largely influenced by the amount of nutrition available 

 when the primordial cell is fertilized. If sex itself may be influ- 

 enced by nutrition, the subsequent growth of its representative or- 

 gans may still further be influenced, which would introduce into 

 the consideration an additional element aside from temperature 

 alone. 



I have my own postulate as to the significance of dichogamy. 

 I rest here by the simple proposition that whatever its significance, 

 it arises from no effort innate to the jjlant itself, but from an outside 

 force that can have little interest in cross-fertilization. 



(It is proper to say that an abstract of this paper was read before 

 the American Association for the Advancement of Scierice, at Cleve- 

 land. See Botanical Gazette for September 1888.) 



Trientalis Americana, Pursh. There can be but little doubt that 

 Trientalis Americana grew freely over what is now the city and 

 county of Philadelphia. It is still found in adjoining counties, and 

 here and there are old botanists who remember having collected it 

 on the confines of the county ; but it is not included m Barton's 

 Flora, now over 60 years old, — nor in Darrach's Catalogue, or any 

 published list so far as I know. In an old chestnut wood at Chest- 

 nut Hill, my brother Joseph detected a small patch this summer, 

 that has evidently been there for ages, but overlooked, — and this 

 suggests some thoughts on its habits and past geographical record of 

 ireneral interest. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 395 



I have collected this plant in its various forms over widely sepa- 

 rated portions of the American continent, — Canada, the Alleghauies, 

 California and Alaska, — and though holding its own wherever 

 found, it does not show evidences of the extension that must have 

 characterized it in the past, when, with no remarkably special- 

 ized organs favoring distribution, it managed to travel in its various 

 forms — as T. Europcea, T. Americana and T. Arctica — over the whole 

 north of Europe and across the American continent to Behring's 

 Straits. So far as I have seen in the localities named, the plants 

 seem to produce seeds, though not abundantly ; but there are no 

 evidences of seedlings. In the Chestnut Hill location, the only tract 

 on which the plant is found is but a few hundred square feet, yet 

 though unnoted, it must have been confined to this limited area for 

 at least a hundred years, or perhaps for many centuries. The piece 

 of Avood is a favorite botanical hunting ground. I myself have 

 wandered through it for over a quarter of a century, and the early 

 Philadelphia botanists — sharp-eyed as they Ave re — would surely have 

 seen it here if at all common in those times. It is worth while 

 considering how so great a wanderer in remote ages should 

 have acquired such remarkable stay-at-home habits in recent times. 

 Some conditions favorable to distribution must surely have existed, 

 which have disappeared in modern ages. What can these changes 

 be? 



So far as persistency is concerned I note a fact, not recorded any- 

 where, that the plant is stoloniferous, bearing a small tuber at the 

 end of a slender thread, which reproduces the plant next year, the 

 whole of the previous years' plants, except these little tubers, dying 

 away. In this way the plant, through its progeny, can be a traveler 

 at the rate of two or three inches a year. It is remarkable that this 

 character is not noted by systematic authors, for the specimens in the 

 herbarium of the Academy taken at various times during the flowering 

 period, from different parts of the Avorld, exhibit traces of the little tu- 

 bers at the ends of stolons that have evidently been passed over for 

 true roots. It is hardly to be supposed that the plants have wan- 

 dered wholly by the aid of these little tubers, valuable as they 

 must be for persistency when once a foot-hold has been obtained. 

 We are forced to the conclusion that at some former period it re- 

 ceived much more aid from seed and seedlings than it receives in 

 modern times.

On the glands in some Caryophyllaceous Jloivers. It cannot be 

 said that the existence of glands near the base of the common 

 chickweed and its allies, has been wholly overlooked, but they are 

 seldom referred to, and no attempt has been made to read their 

 significance. 



In regard to the chick-weed, Stellaria media. Withering notes in 

 the British Flora (p. 547) " stamens glandular at the base." Dr. 

 Bromfield notes of a closely related species, Stellaria ulignosa, 

 " stamens 10, those alternating with the petals inserted on shortish, 

 flattened glands ; near, but not close to the base of the germen ; 

 being, in fact, above the latter and at the top of the conical enlarge- 

 ment of the calyx below the sepals" (J<7ora Vectensis 71). At p. 

 75, the same author notes oi Arenaria serpyllifolia " stamens 5 to 10, 

 those alternating with the sepals placed on a projecting glandular 

 base, five shorter, having apparently abortive anthers." Of Honck- 

 enya peloides, both Torrey and Gray and Withering note the ten 

 glands alternating with the stamens ; and Hooker remarks of Cher- 

 leria sedoides that it has glands inside the five stamens. 



Examining with a pocket lens, feome flowers of the chickweed, 

 between two and three o'clock in the afternoon early in May, I 

 noticed the glands had secreted an enormous amount of liquid. 

 The little globules were nearly as large as ordinary pin heads. 

 It did not occur to me, at that time, that the period of the day 

 had anything to do with the phenomena, but I was led to ex- 

 amine other allied species of plants the next day. I did not detect 

 any, and I particularly examined Cerastium viscosum and had about 

 concluded that the existence of prominent glands and a free exudation 

 of liquid was peculiar to the chickweed, when, examining about the 




188^*.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 397 



same time of day as in the former case, I found the exudation as 

 abundant in the Cerastium also. Profiting by this hint, and exam- 

 ining at this time of day all species coming under my notice, I can 

 say that glands exist in Cerastium viscosum, C. arvense, Arenaria 

 serpyllifoUa, Stellaria longifolia, S. media; I could not find the 

 glands in Stellaria puhera. 



It is well known that in Caryophyllacese generally, there are 

 usually ten stamens, in two series, — the outer alternate with the 

 petals, — the inner five alternate with the outer, and opposite the 

 petals. There are often less by abortion, in which case it is the 

 members of the inner series that disappear. ISTo glands are between 

 the stamens of the inner series. There are never but five, and these 

 alternate with outer stamens. The outer series mature the anthers 

 a day before the inner series mature them (except, I believe, in S 

 pubera) ; but the liquid exudation occurs with the maturity of the 

 anthers of the first series. 



The liquid (in the chickweed) has a slightly sweet taste, and is 

 very viscid, as a little taken out with the point of a pen-knife and 

 rubbed between finger and thumb, testifies. 



The five outer stamens in Arenaria serpijllifolia bend inwards, and 

 the abundantly polliniferous anthers rest on the apex of the stigmas, 

 completely covering the stigmas with own-pollen. The inner ones 

 turn outwardly, resting on the petals or nearly so, and seem to have 

 anthers wholly destitute of pollen. In Cerastium viscosum, the pollen 

 matures before the pistils. At the time the pollen scatters, the fasicle 

 of pistils are keeping close company. Soon afterwards they diverge, 

 push themselves up among the pollen-clothed stamens, and are cer- 

 tainly self-fertilized in most, if not absolutely in all cases. 



Examining the chickweed as it grew over a very large tract of 

 waste ground, and soon after noon, when with a close naked-eye ob- 

 servation the comparativelv large globules can be seen glistening in 

 the sun, — one can scarcely neglect asking nature the chief object of 

 this enormous production of sweet liquid, — for the collective quan- 

 tity from these millions of flowers may be truly styled enormous. 

 It has been asserted that nectar is given to flowers to attract insects 

 for the purpose of cross-fertilization, and many observations confirm 

 the deduction in numerous instances. Certainly the nectar attracts 

 and as certainly the visits often result in fertilization — sometimes 

 by the flowers' own pollen, oftener by the pollen from flowers on the 

 same or neighboring plants, and occasionally from flowers from 




398 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



plants under different conditions, the true Darwinian idea of cross- 

 fertilization. But I could see no bees visiting the duckweed for 

 this banquet of nectar set before them. As the flowers are arranged 

 for self-fertilization, there could be no assistance to the flowers in 

 this work even did bees visit them. If insects came, in no way does 

 it appear they could be of any advantage. Because I did not see 

 any bees using the nectar during warm days following the first ob- 

 servations, it does not follow that they never resort to it. Bees go 

 to those flowers where their hard task is the easiest. I have often 

 seen them collecting pollen from chickweed, when a few warm early 

 spring days attracted them from the hive, but at soon as the male 

 catkins of the Avillow mature, with their very abundant crop of pollen, 

 they leave the chickweed, and indeed most other flowers, while the 

 willow pollen lasts. 



Later on, about the middle of May, I found nectar-collecting 

 honey bees working freely on Cerastium viscosum. It is never safe 

 to say bees or other insects do not visit certain flowers. It depends 

 largely on the supply of material. When abundant they evidently 

 have preferences, and let the more difficult tasks alone.

BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE OF GEORGE W. TRYON, Jr. 



BY \y. S. W. RUSCHEXBERGEK, M. D. 



" for, go at night or noon, 



A friend, whene'er he dies, has died too soon, 

 And, once we hear the hopeless //e is dead. 

 So far as flesh hath knowledge, all is said." 



ya7?ies Russell Lowell — Agassiz. 



The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia requested me, 

 February 7th, 1888, to prepare a biographical notice of the late 

 George W. Tryon, Jr. for publication in its Proceedings. He died 

 February 5. The suddenness of the event shocked all his personal 

 and many of his merely scientific friends, far and near. One (Mr- 

 C. E. Beddome), who is in every sense qualified to justly appraise 

 his worth, said to me in a note, dated Tasmania, April 4, not very 

 long since received, — " I have respected him as one of the grandest 

 couchologists of the day. I feel that I have lost my most valued 

 correspondent ; but what must be the loss of your academy and the 

 conchological world. His great work ' Manual of Conchology,' not 

 yet finished, will be the grandest monument that could be erected to 

 his memory." 



Eminence, fairly acquired by a toiler on any path of learning or 

 scientific research, wins admiration, especially from those moving 

 forward on the same quest, w^hether in his neighborhood or in places 

 widely remote ; and after he dies, they become more or less curious 

 about his origin and career. Some are pleased to seek causes of his 

 success in the circumstances of his life, assuming that social environ- 

 ment sways the formation of character, just as physical conditions 

 surrounding certain organisms are supposed to influence their de- 

 velopment. Students of this class ask where the eminent man was 

 born and raised and trained, as well as what notable features char- 

 acterized the locality W'here he grew to be distinguished among his 

 associates. Those of another sort, who confide almost entirely in 

 the doctrines of heredity, are disposed to ascribe the notable qualities 

 of a contemporary to his j^arents and their ancestors, thus failing to 

 recognize in him any merit wholly and clearly his own. They seem 

 to forget that uncommon intellectual force, mental capability is not 

 always traceable to heredity or to environment in any considerable 




400 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1888. 



extent. All the great heroes of science and literature did not have 

 scientific ancestors or scientific environment. The genius of neither 

 Franklin nor Shakespeare was an inheritance. 



George Washington Tryon Jr. the eldest son of Edward K. Tryon 

 and his wife, nee Adeline Savitd, Avas born May 20, 1838, on Green 

 street between Front and Newmarket streets, then in the district of 

 the Northern Liberties. The place of his birth is about twelve or 

 fifteen hundred yards, to the northward and eastward of the State 

 House of Philadelphia, — Independence Hall. The locality was 

 never a fashionable quarter of the city. It abounds in alleys and 

 courts of small tenements, having small windows glazed w^ith eight 

 by ten inch panes, and roofs of cedar shingles, as may be seen to-day. 

 A substantial, industrious i:)eople, most of them engaged in mechan- 

 ical pursuits, inhabited the neighborhood, the alleys and streets of 

 which were the play-grounds of their many children. It is now as 

 it was fifty years ago, only the signs of age in some spots are prob- 

 ably more apparent. 



George Washington Tryon, a gunsmith, had trained his son, 

 Edward K. Ti-yon in the manufacture and trade in fire-arms and 

 sportmen's accoutrements, a business which he had established and 

 conducted successfully during a quarter of a century or more. He 

 retired in 1837, leaving his son in possession of the establishment. 



George W. Tryon Jr. at an early age manifested a retiring, cheer- 

 ful and considerate disposition. His interest in the sports and 

 games of boys was not sufiicient to divert him from books. When 

 about seven years old he began to collect specimens of natural his- 

 tory. The taste was encouraged by giving him a room at home in 

 which to display them to members of a society of infiint naturalists 

 which he formed. From the start, shells received most of his atten- 

 tion. 



The observant and reflective character of the child's mind is 

 notable. He early discovered that a nomenclature was necessary to 

 satisfactorily arrange even a small collection of specimens. He in- 

 vented one. He named shells according to their shapes or colors, as 

 the round shell, the white shell ; one of such irregular form as puz- 

 zled him to designate he called the funny shell. The habit of gath- 

 ering specimens of natural history begun without method in infancy, 

 and more and more systematized as his experience and observation 

 matured, was life-long. His first and predominant love for shells 

 increased with his years and made him an industrious votary of 

 conchology. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 401 



He was taught the rudiments of learning at home. After he had 

 passed through one or two private schools for children, it was deter- 

 mined that he should receive academic instruction in the Friends* 

 Central School, because it was regarded to be the best available. It 

 Avas then in Race between Fourth and Fifth streets, and now is at 

 the S. W. corner of Race and Fifteenth streets. 



He became a pupil of the institution in October 1850, and con- 

 tinued till his school days ended, June 1853. During the almost 

 three years here his attention was given only to English studies 

 and drawing. The transfer of the family residence, in 1852, to 

 Pittville, one of the purlieus of Germantown, five or six miles 

 from the business centre of Philadelphia, did not interrupt his regu- 

 lar attendance at school, nor hinder the growth of his museum. 

 The family returned to, and was permanently established in the city, 

 in 1869. 



Very soon after leaving the Friends' Central School he employed 

 tutors in the city and studied French, German, and jNIusic until he 

 had acquired knowledge enough, to write and speak the languages 

 sufiiciently well for practical purposes, and to understand the princi- 

 ples of musical composition. About this time with some of his 

 young friends he formed a musical society or club. Their perform- 

 ances enlivened the evenings at their country homes. 



His interest in books created in him a desire to be an author. 

 His first effort in this direction was a history of the United States 

 finished when he was twelve years old, but not printed. A few^ 

 years later he announced that literary and scientific work would be 

 his permanent occupation. But, at the earnest request of his parents, 

 he relinquished the project, for a time, and engaged in mercantile 

 work in his father's establishment. At the age of nineteen, 1857, 

 he was given a share in the business, and on the retirement of his 

 father in 1864, he became the principal of the firm, and so contin- 

 ued till 1868, when he retired with a modest income, sufficient in 

 his estimation to justify indulgence in unrestrained pursuit of science 

 and lettei-s. 



He found relaxation from business cares in music. Though not a 

 notably skilful player on any instrument, he was acquainted with 

 the science of music. 



He wrote a comic opera in three acts, entitled. Amy G'assonet or 

 the Elopement, which was acted at the Amateur Drawing Room, 

 and published; but it was in no sense successful. The copyright is 

 dated 1875.

He sought to spread a love of music among the people and to 

 elevate their taste. With this in view he joined in the management 

 of the Germania Orchestra for a season. It was a failure. His 

 partner disappeared, and Mr. Tryon had to supply pecuniary defi- 

 ciencies. 



In connection with a musical-publication firm — Lee and Walker, — 

 he edited and published, prior to 1873, librettos of fifty-two stand- 

 ard and popular operas. During 1874 and 1875, he revised and 

 edited the sheet-music publications of Lee and Walker, and in the 

 sama years edited The Amateur ; a monthly magazine of music and 

 literature. He also arranged a series of operatic songs which were 

 published, in 1875, under the title of Operatic Gems. In 1884, he 

 published " Sacred Songs for Choir and Home Circles, a Collection 

 of Solos, Concerted Pieces, Hymns, etc.," the music of which consist- 

 ed largely of selections from the scores of the more popular operas. 



Mr. Tryon was a warm admirer of the fine arts, and occasionally 

 amused himself with painting. 



Music and the fine arts were secondary occupations ; they never 

 diverted him from the pursuit of natural history. 



He was elected a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences of 

 Philadelphia, June 1859. From that time till the end of his life no 

 one did more to promote the interests of the institution. His ser- 

 vices were many and important. The society is largely indebted to 

 Mr. Tryon for the edifice which it now occupies. On his motion, 

 November 14th, 1865, a committee was formed " to devise methods 

 for advancing the prosperity and efficiency of the academy, by the 

 erection of a building " etc. He was appointed chairman of the 

 committee. The measures recommended by it were adopted. The 

 election of a Board of Trustees of the Building Fund followed, Jan. 

 11, 1867. Mr. Tryon was appointed Secretary and held the office 

 till he died, twenty-one years. He was a member of the building 

 committee. No one labored more assiduously in every way to pro- 

 mote the completion of the enterprise which he had started. He 

 gave S3000 to the building fund ; and his generosity enabled the 

 Conchological Section of the Academy to give to it as much more. 



Mr. Tryon was elected a Curator of the academy, January, 1869, 

 and resigned July, 1876. Under his direction and personal attention 

 the numerous collections of the museum were safely transferred, in 

 January 1876, from the old, and arranged in the new building. This 

 arduous task was admirably performed. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 403 



At his instigation the Conchological Section of the Acadeni}' of 

 Natural Sciences was founded, December 26, 1866. He was a con- 

 stituent member, and its Conservator from December, 1875, thir- 

 teen years. His skill in conchology is manifest in th^ admirable 

 arrangement and classification; and his incessant carefulness, in the 

 excellent condition of the collections which were under his official 

 charge. According to the annual report of the Section, December 

 1887, they consisted of 189,150 specimens, contained in 51,327 trays 

 each with an appropriate label. This enormous collection, and an al- 

 most complete conchological library of 954 volumes, besides 455 

 pamphlets, bound in 26 volumes, all accessible under one roof, render 

 the facilities of study of the subject in the academy unsurpassed. 



April 9, 1867, he made a special deposit of more than ten thousand 

 species of shells and more than a hundred jars of specimens, chiefly 

 of naked moUusks, in alcohol, gathered during his life-long devotion 

 to the subject, on condition that none should be loaned. They were 

 appropriately intercalated with the academy's collection. The dupli- 

 cates were sold, by his direction, and the pr(?ceeds of sales covered 

 into the treasury of the Conchological Section. It is notable that 

 he did not stipulate that this very large contribution — the largest 

 private collection in this country — should be kept separate from the 

 rest of the museum and designated by his name, which is a 

 usual condition attached to donations of private natural-history 

 cabinets to public museums. It was his opinion that it is unwise to 

 accept cabinets on such terms, because it must result sooner or later, 

 in encumbering the museum Avith the care of numberless and useless 

 duplicates, for which space cannot be easily afforded. 



The records show that Mr. Try on contributed valuable specimens 

 to the museum every year during the remainder of his life. 



He gave, May 7, 1867, 119 volumes and 56 pamphlets on conchol- 

 ogy to the library. 



The first number of the American Journal of Conchology, of 

 whifch Mr. Tryon was the editor and proprietor, was issued, Febru- 

 ary 1865. Seven volumes were published, the last number in May, 

 1872. After the institution of the Conchological Section of the 

 Academy it was issued, nominally, by the publication committee of 

 the Section, of which Mr. Tryon was chairman, but he was still the 

 editor. The third and subsequent volumes contain summaries of 

 the proceedings of the Section at its stated meetings. 




404 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



To the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural. Sciences, and to 

 the American Journal of Conchology Mr. Tryon contributed sixty- 

 four papers, between 1861 and 1873, inclusive, a list of which is ap- 

 pended. . 



In conjunction with Mr. Wm. G. Binney, in 1864, Mi". Tryon edited 

 the complete writings of C. S. Rafinesque on recent and fossil conch- 

 ology. In 1866, he published A Monograph on the terrestrial mol- 

 lusca of the United States; in 1870, A Monograph of the Fresh- 

 water univalve mollusca of the United States ; in 1873, American 

 Marine Conchology, and A Monograph on the StreptoraatidjeT Amer- 

 ican Melanians) of North America. This work was prepared at the 

 instance of the Smithsonian Institution, and published in its Miscel- 

 laneous Collections, in December. It was a result of several years' 

 study. The manuscript was completed in 1865, and laid aside. At 

 the end of seven or eight years, he again took up the subject, which 

 he regarded as " one of the most interesting and difficult branches of 

 American Conchology," and found himself " inclined to question 

 many of the conclusions " which he had reached. In the preface of 

 the work he says: — "A more enlarged acquaintance with fresh- 

 water shells convinces me that a much greater reduction of the 

 number of species than I have attempted must eventually be made ; 

 but until the prolific waters of the Southern States have been sys- 

 tematically explored, and a great collection of specimens 'obtained, 

 which shall represent every portion of those streams and include as 

 many transitional forms as can be procured, a definite monograph 

 of our Melanians cannot be written." 



More conclusive evidence of Mr. Tryon's habitual devotion 

 to accuracy in all his work than is contained in the history of the 

 preparation of this monograph is not required. 



Mr. Tryon, for the sake of relaxation, left Philadelphia, May 

 1874, and returned September 19. During an absence of four 

 months, he visited England, Holland, Belgium, Germany, France, 

 Switzerland, Italy. 



In a series of letters he Avrote good-humored, cheerful sketches of 

 his impressions of people and places at which he halted on his way. 

 They were published in the Amateur; a monthly magazine of Music, 

 and Literature. 



He visited England and the continent of Europe again in 1877. 

 His route included Liverpool, London, Paris, Marseilles, and thence 

 along the coast of the Mediterranean to Nice, San Remo, Genoa, 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 405 



Pisa, Rome, Naples, Sorrento ; returning through Venice, Florence, 

 Turin, Geneva, Chamouni, Berne, Mayence ; the Rhine, Cologne, 

 Brussels, Antwerp and back to London, Liverpool and home, in the 

 autumn. 



Now, naturally imbued with the love of truth exclusively for the 

 truth's sake ; possessed of the true methods of scientific inquiry, and 

 equipped with the results of his life-long home studies of the mol- 

 lusca, as well as of his observations in the European museums and 

 cabinets, Mr. Tryon devised the plan of his greatest work — Manual 

 of Conchology — and promptly began its execution. 



The plan embraced four series of volumes. The first series of 

 eleven or twelve volumes is devoted to the marine univalves ; the 

 second, of six or seven, to the terrestrial mollusca ; the third, of four 

 or five, to the marine bivalves, and the fourth, of four or five vol- 

 umes, to the fluviatile genera. 



The Manual of Conchology, completed according to the author's 

 plan, will consist of from twenty-one to twenty-nine octavo volumes, 

 all fully illustrated. 



The scope of this great work is described in the " advertisement " 

 or preface of the first number, which was finished and ready for pub- 

 lication in the last week of December, 1878. Mr. Tryon says, the 

 Manual " will include, in systematic order, the diagnoses of all the 

 genei'a and higher divisions of the mollusca, both recent and fossil, 

 and the descriptions and figures of all the recent species ; together 

 with the main features of their anatomy and physiology, their em- 

 bryology and development, their relations to man and other animals, 

 and their geological and geographical distribution." 



The numbers of the first series were issued quarterly. Volume 

 IX was completed December 1887. The nine volumes include 3125 

 pages of text, illustrated by 680 plates of 12.055 figures. 



The first number of the second series — terrestrial mollusca — was 

 distributed Januar}^ 1885, and thereafter quarterly to the close of 

 Vol. Ill, December 1887. The three volumes contain 942 pages of 

 text, illustrated by 187 plates of 6,434 figures. 



Conscious that he probably might not live to complete his enter- 

 prise, but without foreboding, Mr. Tryon interested Mr. H. A, Pils- 

 bry in it. To him he freely imparted his purposes and views in 

 connection with it, so that he might continue the publication, should 

 it become necessary. Mr. Pilsbry, who had the unreserved confi- 

 dence of the author, has succeeded him in his ofiice and will edit 




406 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



the work according to the plan. It will be published by the Conch- 

 ological Section of the Academy, of which Mr. Pilsbry is the Con- 

 servator. 



Mr. Tryon published the first volume of Structural and System- 

 atic Conchology, in 1882 ; the second, in 1883, and the third and 

 last volume, in 1884. The three volumes contain 1195 octavo pages 

 of text, illustrated by 140 plates of 3,087 figures. 



During the last ten years of his life, Mr, Tryon wrote 5262 octavo 

 pages on conchology, illustrated by 1007 plates of 21,576 figures. 

 To the labor of composition the business cares of publication were 

 added : he was the publisher of his own works. 



Until his admission into the Friends' Central School, October 

 1850, whatever religious impressions he may have imbibed in child- 

 hood, if any, came from the Sunday School and the examj^le and 

 teaching of his parents who were Lutherans. After leaving school, 

 Jime 1853, he became interested in the Society of Friends and reg- 

 ularly attended its meetings during several years. For reasons, no 

 doubt conclusive and satisfactory to himself, he left the meetings of 

 the Friends, and, from about the year 1876, he was usually present 

 at the stated services of the Fii-st Unitarian Church of Philadelphia, 

 When it was proposed, about 1883, to construct a new building for 

 the church Mr. Tryon was chosen one of its trustees. The work 

 interested him. He gave very generously ($1000) in aid of its com- 

 pletion. He was long chairman of the Society's committee on 

 music, and, until his death, was prominent among those who, in 

 various ways, actively promoted the interests of the church. 



He was not, however, rigidly sectarian. Knowing that there is 

 difference on every question that interests men, his natural spirit of 

 tolerance swayed his viewsand conduct relatively to those holding 

 opinions opposite to his own. 



He printed for private circulation, a pamphlet entitled. Church 

 and Stage, with the motto. Flat justitia, mat ccelum. It contains 

 twelve octavo pages, and is dated March 15, 1880. 



The object of the paper is to uphold the drama as a proj^er means 

 of popular instruction in spite of its general condemnation by 

 clergymen. 



After stating substantially that, in western Europe as well as in 

 ancient Greece, the stage is the off-spring of the ceremonies of public 

 worship — that the mystery play, which followed the liturgical drama, 

 was the first form of the serious national stage in England, France, 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 407 



Italy, Spain and Germany/ he contends that in as much as the 

 theatre has originated independently and exists under many types 

 of civilization — Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Greek, Roman and mod- 

 ern European — and the influence of the Christian Church exerted 

 against it through so many centuries has failed to extirpate it, the 

 institution is likely to continuously thrive. Thei'efore, instead of 

 persistently denouncing the stage, it would be more politic to 

 kindly endeavor to point out and eliminate from it all acting that 

 is, in any degree, detrimental to morality. 



His manner of treating the subject may be seen in the following 

 quotations : 



" The first charge is, ' that dramas are frequently immoral stories, 

 abounding in covert or open indecencies of language or action — 

 sometimes actually blasphemous.' We appeal to any regular theatre 

 goer whether his experience does not partially confirm this. Even 

 those who frequent dramatic representations with the intention of 

 encouraging only meritorious and unobjectionable plays, occasionally 

 through ignorance of the matter of some new drama, or misled by 

 uncandid notices of the press, find themselves ' assisting ' at repre- 

 sentations, quite bad enough to destroy their faith in the theatre. 

 Our own experience, however, and we believe that it will be borne 

 out by the experience of every play-goer who has not depraved in- 

 stincts, is that plays are usually entirely innocent, and those of a 

 serious character are intended to and do inculcate good morals and 

 right living, that they teach man's whole duty with, (no words are 

 more expressive), dramatic force ; that is to say, they make an im- 

 pression such as can never be made by either reading or lecture ; 

 for, to the power of trained declamation is added the verisimilitude 

 of scenery and action. The eye as well as the ear receives and 

 transmits the 'lesson to the brain and heart, ^o sermon can be 

 so effectual for good, simply preached from the pulpit as when it is 

 embodied in appropriate action : — that brings it home to us in all 

 its reality ; it is no longer a mere abstraction. 

 The play's the thing 

 Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king. 



" Such is a good play, better than the best sermon, not only more 

 powerful but more far-reaching in its beneficent mission. 



" Then if we take up the clerical charge once more, and agree 

 that the amount of evil done by conveying this indecency or blas- 



1 See Harper's Magazine, Dec. 1888, p. 62. 




408 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



phemv through the vividness of dramatic portrayal is incalcuable ; 

 that it familiarizes the auditors with wrong thinking, speaking and 

 doing, and thus lowers the moral tone of the community,' on the 

 other hand, a good play, by parity of reasoning, should have an 

 equally incalculable good influence, and we believe that it has. The 

 vast majority of men [who] are not attracted towards the church, 

 find themselves unable to comprehend its methods, endure its limita- 

 tions, or perhaps appreciate its motives — and for these, else left 

 without moral instruction, the play yields along with its human 

 interests and entertainment, its realistic teaching by' example as 

 well as precept. 



" Xay more, the clergyman who objects to the representation of 

 the prayer scene in ' Hamlet,' does not hesitate to read the passage, 

 or to hear it read, perhaps by the very actor who is accustomed to 

 play the part, and who will throw into it all the emotion and all 

 the action that the lecture platform permits him. He will even 

 listen to this recital in the opera house probably, and without 

 alarming his conscience ' because it is not a dramatic performance, 

 but only a recital.' 



" Thus, to be consistent, it seems that we must at least tolerate 

 upon the stage, that which we approve in the lil)rary or lecture 

 room. But this point is not yet exhausted : there are various con- 

 ceptions of morality perhaps, and that of the churchman is not 

 necessarily the highest. Xo one will deny that among theatre-goers 

 are to be found persons who are as cultivated in religion, morals 

 and manners, as tender of conscience, as responsive to the call of 

 duty as any of the abstainers. Is it not rather illiberal then to 

 assume that these persons only visit the theatre because they, in this 

 particular, disregard the voice of conscience? Again, the lower 

 classes of mankind, who frequent the sensational second-class play, 

 who read the equally sensational second-class ' weekly ;' are they to 

 be frowned down on account of the vulgarity of their amusements? 

 The uncultured cannot become educated christian people at a bound : 

 generations of refining influences are required to efiect the transfor- 

 mation. For these men and women in process of enlightenment, 

 with yet unformed, or badly formed tastes, the theatre is a civilizing 

 agent of far greater power than it is for their Ijetters. 



" It may be taken for granted that actors as well as audiences are 

 susceptible to the moral or immoral lessons of the drama, and if, 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 409 



as we assert, the vast majority of plays exert great, thougli un- 

 obtrusive moral influence, then so far as their profession may be 

 supposed to affect their conduct we should expect to find actors 

 respectable and worthy the acquaintance of the pure and noble. 

 But, it will be said, there is abundant evidence that at least many 

 actors are dissolute people, that the}^ live low, vagabond lives, are 

 indecent in language and conduct, drunkards, gamesters, irreligious. 

 The evidence, alas ! is abundant, and if it could be proven that the 

 proportion of actors who are disreputable is larger than in other 

 professions, we might accept the fact as some evidence of the cause 

 assigned for it ; but it is notorious that in all public professions 

 lapses from rectitude are numerous. 



" A word in conclusion concerning those who, whilst despising 

 the stage and its associations, yet avail themselves of its fruits. They 

 owe their best music to its inspiration ; their best choir singers there 

 received their education ; their minister is himself indebted to it, 

 either directly or indirectly, for the force and grace of style and dec- 

 lamation which render him so impressive. Without the stage you 

 would not be possessed of Shakespeare — whose single influence for 

 good has certainly far outweighed all the evil which the theatre has 

 ever done mankind. Those who while discountenancing the theatre, 

 read Shakespeare or hear him read ; who listen with delight to the 

 operatic overture or aria ; who hang entranced upon the eloquence 

 of the rostrum, are meanly, (I had almost written dishonestly) 

 enjoying the fruits of an institution which they condemn." 



Whether Mr. Tryon's championship of the stage be acceptable 

 or not. few persons will fail to perceive in it his philantrophic dis- 

 position and love of justice, as well as the degree of his inclination to 

 render homage to the IVIuses. 



To those who would withhold all such matters from a biographical 

 account of a scientist as not pertinent, and to those Avhose hostility 

 to the theatre is relentless, the above citations may seem too long ; 

 but they may be excused. They prove that his mental scope took in 

 very much more than the truths of natural science; that the com- 

 paratively inferior and ignorant classes of society had his sympathy, 

 and that he was ready to help improve their mental and moral level. 

 Thus, they indicate a feature of his character not portrayed else- 

 where in liis writings. None will deny that a feature partly or

wholly left out obscures or spoils the likeness, even in a finished 

 painting of a friend. 



Mr. Tryon was notably cautious and conservative in scientific 

 work. The personal reputation incident to success he did not appre- 

 ciate very highly, nor regard to be among the objects of scientific 

 research. Just as a private in the ranks, forgetful of all the labor 

 and perhaps blood he has contributed towards it, delights in the 

 gloi'y of his regiment, wholly unmindful of the pei'sonal distinction 

 he may have fairly earned for himself, so Mr. Tryon toiled to pro- 

 mote the welfare and fame of the academy, within the bounds of 

 which he seemed to have merged his scientific aspirations. Few 

 have been like him iu this respect ; but his example may have fol- 

 lowers. Natural modesty, an almost reclusive disposition made him 

 reluctant to hold office. He often refused to permit friends to nom- 

 inate him for prominent positions in the society, and Avas apparently 

 indiflferent to the honor of membership in other associations. He 

 did not care to publish that he was a corresponding member of the 

 California Academy of Xatural Sciences, from December 1862 ; of 

 the Boston Society of Natural History, from March 1864 ; of the 

 Royal Society of Tasmania, from June 1886, nor of any other in 

 which his name had been enrolled. 



Mr. Tryon's good sense and unselfish nature ; his cheerful, unpre- 

 tentious deportment at all times, won for him aflfectionate respect 

 and enduring friendships. Because lie was punctual, prompt and 

 efficient in doing, within the limits of official duty, whatever con- 

 cerned the interests of the academy, he deserved and had the 

 unreserved confidence of all. 



The quantity and quality of work done during his happy cai-eer 

 are perennial vouchers of his unremitting industry and varied abil- 

 ity. It is doubted whether a collegiate training and the Master's 

 degree would have facilitated his progress and enabled him to ac- 

 quit himself better in any sense. A genius for discovering his own 

 deficiencies, and then filling them by opportune self-help, was a 

 practical substitute for an Alma Mater. 



Mr. Tryon's abiding desire to increase our knowledge of conchol- 

 ogy, which he has done so much to advance, is manifest in his last 

 will and testament, dated March 18th, 1886. 



He bequeathed to the Conchological Section of the Academy cer- 

 tain real estate to be a source of a permanent trust fund, the income 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 411 



from which is to be applied to augment the Conservator's salary, to in- 

 crease the collection of shells, as well as to other purposes, at the 

 discretion of the Section. All profits which may be derived from 

 his conchological works and from his conchological publication bus- 

 iness are to be added to the fund. 



This provision, in connection with the present vast collections and 

 an almost perfect library, goes far towards establishing in the United 

 States the centre of conchology at the Academy of Natural Sciences 

 of Philadelphia. 



Mr. Tryon was methodical in all his ways, and unswervingly firm 

 of purpose. He always did what he believed to be right in face of 

 all opposition ; but he tranquilly considered argument against his 

 opinions, and gracefully yielded them whenever he could not answer 

 it. He passed much of his time in the academy at work among its 

 collections and books. For health's sake he appropriated time for 

 daily exercise in the open air, without much regard to the state of 

 the weather. On Saturday, January 28, 1888, while the temperature, 

 ranged between 12° and 17° F. and the wind was blowing freshly 

 from the north-west, he walked briskly in an easterly direction more 

 than a mile, and returning faced the wind. Paroxysms of difiicult 

 breathing forced him to stop many seconds, and several times. On 

 reaching home he was much depressed physically ; his circulation 

 was abnormally slow and weak, but he soon rallied and seemed to 

 be surely recovering. In the course of two or three days a kind of 

 roseola, to which he had been liable at times since an attack of scar- 

 let fever in childhood, appeared, and towards the last became hem- 

 orrhagic. He died February 5, the eighth day after his cold walk. 



His father, a brother and a sister survive him. His mother died 

 December 23, 1869. He was a bachelor. As far as known he was 

 at no time inclined to change his celibate condition. 



Accepting a definition that poetry is merely the blossom and 

 bloom of human knowledge, Mr. Tryon was Laureate of the king- 

 dom of the mollusca. He well knew all its inhabitants — they were 

 thousands — and characterized every typical one in descriptive lines 

 — full of knowledge but without poetic cadence or poetic measure of 

 any kind. But his whole attention was not given to those mollusks. 

 He had eyes for all natural objects. He Avas fond of flowers, had 

 studied botany successfully, and learned to botanize. In the summer 

 it was his custom to take long walks in the country. On reaching 

 home from those walks he was almost sure to be laden with flowers 




412 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



and grasses, gathered by the way, some for study in connection with 

 his herbarium, which was large, and others to bedeck certain rooms 

 in the liouse. And now and then a mineralogist was surprised to 

 hear him talk so knowingly about minerals. Indeed, his acquaint- 

 ance with natural history, generally, was sufficiently intimate to 

 make the title of naturalist appropriate to him. His knowledge of 

 nature and natural things was a pure accomplishment, in no sense 

 associated with his bread-wining work while he was the successful 

 man of business. ' 



This imperfect sketch of an eminent benefactor of the academy 

 is fittingly closed with the following tributary stanzas, written by 

 his friend, our fellow member, Mr. John Ford, Feb. 15, 1888. 



Ix MEMORIAM. 



As falls the oak, mature and strong in limb, 

 A giant 'mong its fellows tall and grand, — 



So fell the peer of those whom Science crowns, 

 Th' immortal Tryon, type of noblest men. 



Not human hearts alone do feel the blow 

 That i^truck him down in life's meridian, — 



The leafy woods, the vales, and quiet streams 



Where Nature's gems he sought, alike are grieved. 



E'en Neptune mourns the loss of one who knew 

 His sea-born children all by sight and name ; 



And from their games the Tritons sadly tui-n 

 To breathe a requiem through horns of pearl. 



His form is gone, but deathless evermore 

 On pages manifold his thoughts remain ; 



And there, like ripened fruits, they wait the hands 

 Of all who would their charming flavor prove. 



Though well we know the victor's fadeless crown 

 His brow adorns, and that he dwells in peace, 



Yet do our hearts, remembering the past, 

 Still long to meet him face to face again.

 Mr. Charles IMorris in the chair. 

 Twenty-five persons pressnt. 



Theories of the Formation of Coral Islands. — Mr. Charles Morris 

 remarked that there exist, as is well known, two theories of the 

 formation of coral islands, the subsidence theory of Charles Dar-win, 

 and the recent theory propounded l)y John ^lurrav and others, 

 which claims that the phenomena can be explained without calling 

 in the aid of sul)sidence. It Avas not his purpose to offer any argument 

 on this controverted question, and he would simply say that the 

 Darwin theory seemed to him much the most probable,' the objec- 

 tions to it being, in his view of the case, far less cogent than those 

 to the Murray theory. 



If the subsidence theory wei-e accepted, however, there was oue 

 consequence necessarily deducible from it which, so far as he was 

 aware, had not yet been definitely considered, and which was not 

 without scientific importance. 



The area occupied by coral islands in the Pacific is, as stated by 

 Dana, 6000 miles in length and from 2000 to 2500 miles in width, 

 thus covering from 12,000,000 to 15,000,000 square miles. This 

 includes a blank central area of 1,000,000 square miles in which the 

 subsidence is supposed to have been too rapid to permit coral growth, 

 beyond which is a region of small atolls, and outside this the region 

 of ordinary atolls. Outside this again is a region in which barrier 

 and fringing reefs replace atolls, and if this region be included the 

 total area of subsidence must have been, according to Le Conte, 

 about 20,000,000 square miles. 



The depth of subsidence is variously stated. Dana considers that 

 the extreme subsidence was at least 9000 or 10,000 feet. Later 

 authorities give it at about three miles. As regards the average sub- 

 sidence of the whole area it may perhaps be safely assumed as not less 

 than 5000 feet, possibly considerably more. If the Darwin subsidence 

 theory be accepted, then, an area of sea bottom eipial to that of the 

 largest continent must have sunk bodily to a deptli of at least a 

 mile. 



This subsidence may have been correlative with a considerable 

 elevation of the land surface, but there is no reason to believe that 

 there was any equal elevation of other portions of the ocean bed. 

 There are many evidences of local elevation, but all of them taken 

 together are unimportant as compared with the great subsidence 

 over the coral island area, and may have been balanced by local 

 subsidence elsewhere. Yet such an immense subsidence, with no 

 corresponding elevation of the ocean bottom, could .not take place 

 without adding greatly to the capacity of the ocean basin. It formed 

 Avhat we may speak of as a huge valley in the ocean bed, of 20,000,000 




420 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888, 



square miles in area and one mile in average depth. The filling of 

 such a valley with water must necessarily have caused a marked 

 lowering of the general ocean level. If the figures above given be 

 assumed as correct it is easy to calculate the amount of depression 

 of sea level. 



The area in question is equal to that of Asia and Europe combined, 

 and the effect of its sinking would be equivalent to that of the sink- 

 ing of the Eurasian continent till covered with water to the average 

 depth of one mile; since to fill such a valley in the ocean bed would 

 require as much water as to cover a continent sinking to the same 

 depth. The area named is very nearly one seventh of the whole 

 ocean area, and to fill it to a depth of one mile would cause a general 

 oceanic depression of one-seventh of this depth, or about 750 feet. 

 If the average subsidence be taken at a somewhat greater figure, say 

 7000 feet, the consequence would be a depi-ession of the ocean level 

 of 1000 feet. 



This is no fanciful conclusion. If the subsidence stated really 

 took place, without important elevation of the ocean bed elsewhere, 

 such a lowerincc of the general ocean level must necessarily have 

 occurred to an extent governed by tlie average extent of subsidence. 

 The effect on the relations of land and ocean altitude would be 

 equivalent to an elevation of the whole land surface of the earth to 

 a height of 750 or 1000 feet, or some other height dependant on the 

 real degree of subsidence. 



Such an effect must have left its marks, in the exposure of con- 

 siderable areas of new land along sloping shores, in the draining of 

 bays and estuaries, the ])ossible conversion of bays into partly or 

 fully land-locked seas, and other drainage results. In fact if such a 

 virtual elevation of all the shore regions of the earth took place it 

 would seem as if it must have left some generally traceable indica- 

 tions, which Avould furnish an argument in favor of the subsidence 

 theory. Yet it may have been so complicated with actual elevations 

 and depressions of the land surface as to destroy evidences of its 

 existence in most localities. That land drainage and shore eleva- 

 tion did take place to a considerable extent during the Tertiary 

 epoch is acknowledged, but whether these were due to actual eleva- 

 tion, or to a sinking of the ocean level, is a problem which cannot 

 be definitely solved without much fuller evidence than we possess 

 at present.

ON TWO NEW SPECIES OF STARFISHES. 

 BY J. E. IVES. 



While engaged in reviewing the starfishes in the collection of the 

 Academy, I found two forms belonging to the genera Pteraster and 

 Coronaster which do not appear to have been described. They may 

 be thus characterized: 



Pteraster tesselatus, n. sp. 



Dorsal surface very convex ; arms tapering at their aboral end?, 

 and much recurved. Supradoi'sal membrane regularly reticulated ; 

 reticulation forming obliquely arranged hexagonal areas, which are 

 very apparent upon the sides of the arms. Ko spicules found in the 

 supra-dorsal membrane. Paxillte about 2 mm. high. Each paxil- 

 la surmounted by eight radiating spinelets enclosing a number of 

 smaller ones. 



The spinelets when examined under the mi- 

 croscope are found to be composed of two or more 

 connected many-sided hollow cylinders, the sides of 

 which are perforated by elongated apertures as show^n 

 in the figure representing a portion of a cylinder 

 highly magnified. The distal ends of the spinelets 

 are inserted into the delicate membranous bands which 

 form the reticulation of the supra-dorsal membrane. 

 Some of the spinelets perforate this membrane in the 

 centres of the hexagonal areas, projecting slightly on 

 On the dorsal surface of the disk and arms, especially 

 in the hollows of the inter-radial portions of the disk and of the 

 recurved arm, there are numerous minute folds of the integument 

 that produce a somewhat granulate appearance of the membrane. 

 There are 25-30 spiracula in each hexagonal area. The oscular 

 orifice is surrounded by a number of webbed spinelets. 



On the ventral surface the acti no-lateral spines are short, about 

 70 on each side of the ambulacral furrow. There are a correspond- 

 ing number of ambulacral combs. At the base of the arm each 

 comb has 6 spines ; the three outer spines are the longest and about 

 equal ; the fourth (counting from the outside) rather smaller, the 

 fifth very small, and the rudimentary sixth spine very minute, and 

 directed towards the aboral end of the arm. The number of spines 



the surface. 




422 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



in a comb decreases towards the end of the arm. The amljulac- 

 ral feet are in two rows, 80-90 feet in each ray. There are twelve 

 spines at each angle of the mouth forming a single web. The four 

 central spines are the longest, the first pair of spines on the outside 

 of these rather smaller, the next half the size of the last pair, and the 

 two outermost pairs very short. Two large well developed secondary 

 mouth-spines in each interradial angle. 



Greatest diameter of specimen from tip of one arm to tip of an 

 opposite arm 100 mm. ; proportion of radius of disk to radius of arm 

 as 1 to 2 : height of disk 35 mm. 



A single specimen ; color in alcohol, dull yellowish grey. 



This species differs from Fterasfer pulviHus, Sars,to which it appears 

 to be closely allied, by its longer arms ; the absence of large conical 

 papillre upon the supra-dorsal membrane; its greater size, being 

 about half as large again; the relatively much greater mnnber of am- 

 bulacral combs and actino-lateral spines, and the difierent size and 

 number of the spines of the ambulacral combs. It also appears to 

 be closely allied to Pt. semi ret iciilatus, Sladeu, but may be distin- 

 guished from it by the prominent central si)inelets of the paxilhc, 

 which perforate the supra-dorsal membrane; the greater number 

 and difference in size of the spiracula ; the absence of any tendency 

 towards a quadruple arrangement of the ambulacral feet — the great- 

 er number of ambulacral and mouth spines, and in its greater size 

 being about 3V times as large as Pt. seinireticidatus. It diffei's al- 

 together from Pteraster aporus, described by Dr. H. Ludwig from 

 Behring Sea, — PL aporus having no oscular orifice. Pt. aporm ap- 

 pears to be the only species of Pteraster that has hitherto been de- 

 scribed from that region. 



Below, I give a list of the species of Ptera.^ter that have been 

 described up to the present time.

 Coronaster bispinosus, n. sp. 



Twelve long slender arms. 



Dorsal skeleton of disk reticulated ; formed of imbricated ossicles, 

 and enclosing irregularly shaped meshes in which are found from 

 four to ten respiratory tubes. Distributed irregularly on the skele- 

 ton of the disk are short spines, each bearing a little cluster of cross- 

 ed pedicellariai. Madreporic plate small and submarginal. 



Dorsal skeleton of arms reticulated: Reticulation formed by 

 iive longitudinal bands of imbricated ossicles, connected at about 

 every fourth plate by similar transverse bands, forming laro-e rec- 

 tangular meshes. Meshes longest in the direction of the arms, con- 

 taining a large number of tentacular papillae. Sometimes closer and 

 irregular in shape at the base of the arms. At the junction of the 

 longitudinal and transverse bands, stand long pointed spines, each 

 spine surrounded about its middle by a closely packed cluster of 

 crossed pedicellarite. 



Each of the adambulacral plates carries an inner and outer spine, 

 the outei- spine being slightly more adoral than the inner one, thus 

 showing a tendency of the two spines to alternate. 



Length from centre of disk to end of arm, 140m; radius of disk, 

 12m. 



Color of the single specimen in alcohol pale flesh color, with the 

 skeletal portions white. 



This form undoubtedly belongs to the genus Coronaster of Perrier 

 (EcJiinodermes du Travailleur et du Talisman, Annates des Sciences 

 Naturelles, Vlf Serie, T. XIX. No. 8, 1885.) He gives, however, as 

 a character of the genus the existence of a single spine on each ad- 

 ambulacral plate, whereas in Coronaster bispinosus there are two 

 such spines to each plate. This character of the genus must there- 

 fore be modified in order to admit this species. 




424 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



The form clescribecl differs from Coronaster Parjaiti, Perrier, the 

 only other species of the genus, principally by the character above 

 mentioned, viz, the existence of two spines on each adambulacral 

 plate. It also differs by its greater size, the radius of the disk being 

 twice as great, and the arms from the centre of the disk to their tips,, 

 three times as long.

Double Cocooning in a Spider. — Dr. Henry C. McCook remarked 

 that spiders may be divided into two groups in relation to their 

 cocooning habit. The individuals of one group habitually spin 

 several cocoons. Those of the other group habitually spin but one. 

 The latter, however, are subject to some variation, the reasons for 

 which have not been satisfactorily explained. Epeira diademata 

 for example, habitually spins but one cocoon, and yet the Spanish 

 investigator Termeyer,' in the early part of this century, discovered 

 and announced that she would spin as many as six cocoons when 

 specially nourished. The fact struck the speaker as an extraordinary 

 one, and he had never yet quite obtained consent to fully admit it. 



There are some facts, however, which have recently been uncovered 

 that show a tendency to a variation of habit in this line in one of 

 our familiar orb-weavers. Several years ago a clerical friend, the 

 Rev. Dr. P. L. Jones, had brought him two cocoons of Argiope 

 cophinaria (Walck.)'" which had been spun on his premises by the 

 same spider. The fact seemed to him strange and interesting, and 

 he reported it. About a year ago, Mrs. iMary Treat brought to 

 Dr. McCook's notice the fact that she had discovered what appeared 

 to be a variety of Argiope cophinaria, which makes four cocoons,, 

 and which she had accordingly named Argiope mnltichoncha? She 

 sent him a string of these cocoons of which there were four of the 

 usual shape and about the usual size, strung within a few inches of 

 each other. They were spun on the wall of a kitchen in a house in 

 western INIissouri. Mrs. Treat also sent the spider which spun the 

 cocoons. The specimen was very much dried up and in such a con- 

 dition that the speaker could not make a very satisfactory study of 

 it, but he found nothing in it differing in the least degree from 

 Argiope cophinaria. If it be the same species, what are the peculiar 

 circumstances that have caused such a remarkable variation in the 

 habit? or is it true that tliis species does, more frequently than has 

 been supposed, indulge herself in the luxury of an additional egg- 

 sac? Two cocoons of this lot were opened and found to contain 

 young spiders that had hatched, but died within the egg-sac probably

because of their iinuatural condition. The spiderliugs were not 

 counted but they were very numerous. 



Through information kindly given by Dr. Leidy, the Pre.--ident of 

 tlie Academy, Dr. ]McCook was permitted to study on the olst 

 October last, (1888,) an example of this duplex cocoonery which 

 occurred in the Farmer's Market of Philadel])hia. He visited the 

 market house at 12th and Market Streets, which is one of the largest 

 and best of its sort in our city. He had no difficulty in finding the 

 cocoons which had been preserved, and made a study of them which 

 is here submitted. The facts are as follows : Some time during the 

 summer of the present year, Mr. Charles ■Nloore observed upon his 

 meat stall a spider whose beauty attracted his attention, and which 

 ])roved to be a female 'of Argiope cophinaria. She had probably 

 been lirought into the market from the country, hidden among the 

 leaves of some vegetable, as the huge Tarantula and the large Lateri- 

 grade spider, Heterapodu venatoria, are brought to our port from the 

 West Indies in bunches of banannas and other fruits. However, 

 .she may have floated in as a young balloonist from some city garden, 

 for the species is very abundant in open grounds within city limits. 

 Instead of brushing her down and killing her after the usual manner 

 of dealing with such creature.s, ^Ir. ^Nloore took a fancy to preserve 

 her, and would allow no one around his stall to infiiot any injury 

 upon her. Her movements were necessarily somewhat impeded and 

 modified by the business of the place, and several times she changed 

 her web until at last she spun it in a position that was practically 

 free from interruption. This was quite at the top of the stall, the 

 main foundation line, two feet long, was stretched from a standard 

 beam to the end of a projecting iron hook-rod. The spider became 

 quite a favorite and those around the stall amused themselves by 

 feeding her with flies. She would take the flies thrown into her web, 

 coming down from her habitual ])erch against the central white 

 shield which characterizes her snare, to get them. 



Sometime between the 10th and 20th of August she began to make 

 her first cocoon. Mr. !Moore, of course, made no careful study of the 

 process; but he said that it was spun early in the morning; that at 

 first the spinning work thrown out was as white as snow; that the 

 spider then began to wrap it up, and it grew smaller and smaller as 

 she wrapped, rolling it around with her feet. After the white ma- 

 terial had been spun, a brownish silk was used, and when the spider 

 had completed her task, the ball was not more than half as big as 

 it seemed to him at first. About a week or ten days thereafter, she 

 made a second cocoon, placing it in a position 15 inches above the 

 other. Both of the cocoons were in site precisely as left by the 

 spider. The web, however, had been destroyed, but the speaker 

 noticed that an irregular mass of spinning work was laid along the 

 beam between the two cocoons, which after a little observation 

 proved to be the last snare which the spider had made in a collapsed 

 condition. The foundation line had ])cen broken and the web had 

 thus shrunken up against the post. By delicate and careful manipu- 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 427 



lation, he was able to draw out this mass, and was delighted to find 

 that he could restore w'ith very little damage the spider's orb, the 

 central shield and zigzag ribbons being quite intact. 



The cocoons were both of them spun within tents of crossed lines 

 five or six inches long and four or five wide, and had a thickness of 

 between two and three inches. The lines constituting the under 

 edges of tiie tents were attached to the post of the stall on which the 

 web was spun. The lower cocoon which was spun first, had the top 

 lines of the surrounding tent stayed against an iron bar used to 

 support meat hooks. The upper tent has its roof lines sustained and 

 drawn out ft-om the post by the foundation line of the orb. The 

 lines of which these tents were spun were of a greenish yellow silk, 

 similar to that which the spider uses in preparing the cocoon. He 

 took the cocoons home and dissected them. The lower one was one 

 and one- fourth inches long, seven-eighths inch wide; was composed 

 of a soft yellow silken plush, and inside was constructed precisely 

 like the ordinary egg-sac of this species. It contained 120 eggs, all 

 of them sterile. The only peculiarity in the cocoon was that the 

 stem which one usually finds at the top was missing. The second 

 cocoon was not quite so large, one inch long, and five-eighths inch 

 wide, but it was more perfect in shape, containing the usual stem. 

 The eggs within this cocoon were also sterile, and the number did 

 not exceed 50. As he had on several occasions counted over a 

 thousand eggs in the cocoon of this species, it will be seen that the 

 spider was not in a normal condition. Indeed he had concieved the 

 idea that in most cases where this spider spins more than one cocoon, 

 it will be found that the eggs are iiot fertile, and that on the con- 

 trary when the eggs are in the normal condition, but one cocoon 

 will be made. 



We may probably account for the making of the second cocoon 

 by some abnormal condition of the ovaries which preventi'd the ovi- 

 positing of all the eggs at once. The first lot when extruded were 

 protected in the usiml way; subsequently Nature com[)elled the 

 mother to get rid of the remaining eggs, and, moved by the same 

 impulse that caused her to cover the first lot, she was excited to 

 overspiu the second also. 



This species will make an imperfect or but part of a cocoon in 

 confinement, and Dr. McCook exhibited a specimen which shows 

 that she sometimes does likewise in natural site. This is a branch 

 which in one place shows the beginning of a cocoon, being the little 

 cup against which the eggs are always spun, and also what appears 

 to be the inner egg-bag. There is nothing more, and the whole is 

 stayed and shut in by the usual tent-like spinning work. Near by 

 is a perfect cocoon secured in quite the same manner. If we sup])0se 

 that those two were made by the same spider (as is highly probable) 

 ■we may infer that the original cocooning purpose of the mother was 

 diverted in some manner, j^erhaps by alarjii, which drove her from 

 the spot. She returned to enclose the work partially done; but 

 moved by the urgency of motherhood, presently found a neighboring 

 site and finished her maternal dutv.

Ihe Value of Abbot's Manuscript Draivings of American Spiders. — 

 Dr. Henry C. McCook reviewed some recent criticisms upon a 

 communication presented by him to this Academy. He spoke as 

 follows: 



In the last number of -'Psyche," ^ Mr. J. H. Emerton prints a 

 criticism upon my paper in the Proceedings of the Academy of 

 Natural Sciences of Philadelphia,-' l)ased upon the recent discovery 

 of Mr. John Abbot's drawings of American spiders. This criticism 

 requires some comment. 



1. Mr. Emerton intimates doubt of what he calls my "'off-hand 

 identifications." I spent between one and two hours in the Zoologi- 

 cal Library of the British Museum, aided by the courteous officials. 

 I confined my attention almost wholly to the one tribe with Avhich 

 I am most familiar, the Orbweavers. Of those I published in my 

 pai)er twenty one (21) numbers, embracing seventeen species. Mr. 

 Emerton says: In 1875 I looked over these .same drawings at the 

 British Museum "I, like Mr. McCook, made hasty identifications of 

 such few of them as I could." It might have been true thirteen 

 vears ago that jNIr. Emerton was unable to determine accurately that 

 ■number of common species within the time which I gave to them, 

 but I do not hesitate to say that he could not plead such inability 

 now after his study and publication of the New England Epeiri(!a\ 

 At least, I should have small opiiiion of my own attainments if I 

 could not identify "off-hand," from the admirable drawings of John 

 Abbot, such familiar species ai: most of those named in my list. I 

 think that any entomologist, ftimiliar with Mr. Abbot's work, who 

 will substitute for s|)iders seventeen species of insects with which he 

 is most familiar, will quite agree with me that such determination is 

 not one of great difficulty. 



2. Mr. Emerton does.. scant justice to my paper by leaving the 

 impression that its conclusions are ba.«ed wholly upon the off-hand 

 identifications of an hour or two. On the contrary, that was a 

 small part of my work. I took carefully the numbers of Abbot's 

 drawings with his notes thereon, as well as my own notes upon the 

 same made on the spot. After my return home, I diligently com- 

 pared these with Walckenaer's number, and satisfied myself that 

 the two exactlv corresponded. I then went over Walckenaer's des- 

 criptions in the original (French),"' and coni])ared them with the 

 species themselves in my collection, verifying thus my first identifica- 

 tion. This occupied the leisure hours of several months; and.the 

 indications and, in part, results of all this work may be seen in my 

 paper, where I give the evidence and references by which the student 

 can test my work if he will take the pains to do .so. 



3 Mr. Emerton institutes a comparison between ray published 

 list and a few numbers identified by him, from which he derives a

moral as to "the uncertainty of ofF-hand identifications of these draw- 

 ings by two persons both familiar Avith tlie common spiders of the 

 ]S"orthern States." But the inference is wholly decei)tive, for the 

 basis of his comparison is entirely faulty and unfair. He published 

 a list of thirteen (13) numbers, noted by him as identified thirteen 

 years ago when he visited the British Museum. Of these, four 

 numbers are of other species than Orbweavers ; two other 

 numbers are Orbweavers which I did not notice or did not list. 

 Emerton includes all these in his estimate; but it is manifest that 

 any comparison, in order to yield just results, should throw out these 

 six numbers not listed or considered by me, and should be con- 

 fined wholly to the seven numbers which both of us attempted 

 to identify. Such a comparison justifies a conclusion quite the 

 reverse of ]Mr. Emerton's. We agree as to the following: Nos. 121, 

 116, 117, 79 and 80 — hve out of the seven. How stands it as to the 

 remaining two numbers, (one species) 77 and 78 ? Mr. Emerton 

 marks them with a generic name, " Uloborus. " I list them as 

 " Cyrtophora caudata Hentz, " but in a secondary place, and in a 

 foot-note express my uncertainty as to the identification, and think 

 they may prove to be my own species C. bifurca. Concerning the 

 only species, (embraced in these two numbers) about which we differ, 

 I express my uncertainty, and Emerton merely gives a generic name, 

 showing his uncertainty as to the species. In other words, we are 

 both more or less uncertain, and thus we agree in that respect also. 

 I submit, therefore, that instead of justifying Mr. Emerton's inference 

 of uncertainty, and thus casting doubt upon my identifications, the 

 contrary is shown, for we actually agree in one way or another on 

 every number concerning which both give an opniion. In other 

 words, we absolutely agree concerning five-sevenths of the numbers 

 mutuallv identified, and agree to be uncertain concerning the other 

 two-sevenths. 



As to which list is nearer the truth in the one uncertain factor, 

 I do not venture to decide. Turning to the original description of 

 Walckenaer,^ one finds that he is left in doubt, an(l the doubt can per- 

 haps not be removed. Walckenaer makes one of the numbers a variety 

 of the other. If we read the description of the animal itself, Mr. 

 Emerton's identification as Uloborus is well justified; but when we 

 turn to Abbot's account of the habits of the spider, we find that 

 they differ entirely from all we know of Uloborus, and correspond 

 exactly with the peculiar habits of Cyelosa caudata, especially the 

 habit of covering the central diameter of its vertical net with pellets 

 of silk mixed with in-ecr. detritus. Uloborus spins a horizontal 

 snare; has many ribboned decorations as caudata frequently has, 

 but never has been observed, so far as I know, to decorate her orb 

 witli insect seal page.

4. Mr. Emertou's conclusion concerning the questions raised bv rav 

 paper is that we should wait until all the common spiders of America 

 are described before attempting to determine priority of names. 

 This seems to me very curious reasoning. Emerton ha^< descrilied 

 and figured all but two of the spiders contained in mv list of Abbot's 

 drawings. Does he intend us to count his work as worthless foi' 

 com])arative service? I think better of it than that. With hi.^ 

 New England "Epeiridie" and Hentz's "Spiders of the United States" 

 in my hand, I have no doubt at all of my ability to determine 

 positively therefrom the ultimate names of many species by comparing 

 the same with Walckenaer's descriptions and Abbot's drawings. 

 What we need chiefly is a facsimile copy of the latter somewhere in 

 America; but in lieu of that, that some one should take up the 

 matter in London with a good collection of American spiders. 



Meanwhile, no naturalist ought to doubt that it is our duty to recog- 

 nize the Walckenaer species which we know by whatever means to 

 be identical with descriptions made by Hentz, repeated by Emerton 

 and others, and now thoroughly familiar and recognizable. As to 

 the doubtful species, there can, of course, be no question that they 

 Ijad better remain as named by Hentz and more fully described by 

 others. Walckenaer's descriptions are undoubtedly incomplete and 

 some are jjositively bad, but they are no worse in this respect than 

 many of Hentz's, and in my opinion are just as readily identified l)y 

 the aid of Abbot's drawings as are Hentz's descriptions by the aid of 

 his own drawings. 



At this point I may submit the opinion of one who stands at the 

 very head of living araneologists, Professor T. Thorell, who thus 

 writes me from Italy in a letter dated April 7th, 1888: "The dis- 

 covery of Abbot's drawings of American spiders is indeed a fact of 

 the greatest interest, not only to American but to all arachnologists, 

 and I congratulate you upon having had the luck to make this 

 discovery. Of course I have read with great attention Avhat you 

 have said on the subject, As to me, I do not entertain the least 

 doubt that you and Professors Leidy, Lewis and Dall are right, and 

 that the earlier names should in all cases be adopted. The law of 

 priority must be respected, and is the only one that prevents arbi- 

 trariness and that gives stability to nomenclature. I think, then, 

 that in all such cases, in which Walckenaer's species can with toler- 

 able certainty be recognized, his names should be preferred to names 

 more lately published, even if these names are more commonly used, 

 or the species better described or figured under these newer names.'* 

 The weight of this distinguished authority can not be questioned, 

 and I place it in the scale against the judgment of Mr. Emerton. 



I venture to add from the same letter the following sentence, with 

 the earnest expression of hope that the suggestion therein may be 

 realized: "Would it not be possible to have Abbot's work publish- 

 ed ? There are in America so many wealthy citizens who are 

 willing to make sacrifices for scientific purposes; and in this case an 

 appeal to the national feeling of your countrymen, would not, I 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 431 



think, be out of place." Over against ?nch an exj^ression as this I 

 am Avilling to place my critic's \vords, -'Mr. McCook is inclined, 

 however, to set too high a value on these drawings." 



5. Finally, I think I may say under all the circumstances that 

 I am excusable for believing that my so called "discovery" of 

 Abbot's drawings was a genuine novelty. I cannot remember a 

 single allusion in any araneological literature to the existence in the 

 British Museum or elsewhere of those drawings. The last reference 

 made to them of which I have knowledge was Dr. L. M. Underwood's 

 ])aper on the "Progress of Arachnology in America," in the American 

 Naturalist of November 1887. The author alludes to Abbot's 

 manuscrijAs (miscalling him "Thomas," by the way, instead of 

 "John"), and adds. "Knowledge of the date of preparation of this 

 series of drawings, as well as its present place and condition is want- 

 ing. But it was in London as early as 1802, and was jnirehased by 

 Baron Walckenaer in 1821." Mr. Emerton, in his several admira- 

 ble monographs, makes no reference to the fact that he knew of the 

 existence of the drawings, and does not make the slightest attempt 

 to compare the list in his possession with the descriptions of Walck- 

 enaer. This seems to me all the more remarkable in view of the 

 fact, as above shown, that he had accurately determined some of 

 Hentz's species as identical with some of Abbot's numbers, and could 

 readily have made the further step of determining their correspond- 

 ence with Walckenaer's descriptions. His reasons for this reserve- 

 are doubtless satisfactory to himself, and I will not venture to criti- 

 cize them; but Avill say that I am quite satisfied with having taken 

 the opposite course and given to the world, at the earliest available 

 ojiportunity, the information which had accidentally been placed in 

 my possession, and which I believed at the time to be new and 

 valuable. That it was new to most students of spiders has been 

 made very certain by the responses to my paper. That it is valuable 

 may in some minds admit of doubt; but, on the whole, I think that 

 I have shown here, if not before, that the measure of doubt is very 

 small. 



Food of Barnacles. — Prof Leidy stated that last summer, in 

 June, while walking on shore at Beach Haven, N. J., he picked up 

 a bunch of Goose-barnacles. Lepas fascicnlaris, attached to a frag- 

 ment of a grass stem, Spartina. Finding at the time nothing else 

 of interest, he examined the specimens, not having previously dissec- 

 ted a Barnacle since 1848, when he observed the eyes in Balanus 

 rugosus (See Proc. 1848. 9). 



All the specimens of Lepas, of which there wei-e nine, had the 

 body distended with a brownish-yellow Cyclops, in large number^ 

 fresii in appearance and generally entire. Under the circumstances 

 he at first suspected that they might be a larval form of the Lepas, 

 though aware of the fact that the cirripeds proceed from a Nauplius 

 eml-irvo, which passes through a Cypris stage l)efore assuming the 

 Barnacle condition. On further investigation he was convinced 




432 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



that the Cyclops Avere food and filled the stomach. It appeared 

 remarkable that they should have been so well preserved and not 

 crushed by the strongly, six-toothed mandibles of the Barnacle. 

 Some additional specimens of this species and a few of Lepas anati- 

 fera, subsequently examined did not contain such an accumulation 

 of similar food; but usually the contents of the stomach consisted 

 from two to half a dozen small gastropods with the shell, sevei*al 

 species of entomostraca, some sand grains and a few vegetable fibres. 

 In all, the brood-capsule, a thin elliptical lamina, situated between 

 the body and the shell, contained Xauplius larvae.

REPORT OF RECORDING SECRETARY. 



In view of tlie full reports of the Treasurer, the Curators, the 

 Librarian and the various sections of the Academy, the Recording 

 Secretary has, as heretofore, but little to report apart from the 

 statistics of the meetings of the society and the operations of the 

 Publication Committee. 



One hundred and sixty-eight pages of the Proceedings for 1887 

 and two hundred and seventy-two pages of the current volume have 

 been issued and distributed. Provision has been made for twenty 

 plates in illustration of the papers presented for publication during 

 the year. These number thirty-four and are by the following au- 

 thors:— 



Rev. H. C. McCook 3, W. D. Hartman 3, Jos. Leidy 2, D. S. Jordan 

 2, Harrison Allen 2, Angelo Heilprin, 2, Thomas Meehan 2, Charles

 John Ford 1, C. R. Keyes 1, H. F. Osborn 1, H. A. Pilsbry 1, J. E. 

 Ives 1, John Eyerman 1, R. W. Schufeldt 1. One of these has been 

 withdrawn by the author and the others are all in course of publica- 

 tion although two or possibly four will have to be held over until 

 the issue of the first sheets of the volume for 1889. 



Eighteen additions have been made to the list of foreign corre- 

 spondents to whom the issues of the Proceedings are distributed, the 

 number being now four hundred. The domestic exchanges are 

 now sixty-eight, an increase of seven over last year. The subscrip- 

 tion list remains the same, so that five hundred and eighty-two 

 copies of the one thousand printed are promptly distributed. 



The second part of the ninth volume of the quarto Journal con- 

 sisting of one hundred and ten pages and five lithographic plates 

 Avas distributed, after much vexatious delay in the printing office, on 

 the sixth of August. Fifty copies were sent to foreign and twelve 

 copies to domestic exchanges, while thirty-nine copies were supplied 

 to subscribers, making a total distribution of one hundred and one 

 copies of the five hundred printed.

434 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



The average attendance at the meetings has been about the same 

 as last year. Communications, which have been interesting and 

 Taried, have been made by Messrs Leidy, Heilprin, Lewis, Meehan, 

 Chapman, McCook, Koenig, Dulley, Ryder, Horn, Brooks, Dall, 

 Rothrock, Binder, Willcox, Morris, Wilson, Kelly, Foote, Sharp, 

 Meyer, Woolman, McKean, Robinson, Ford, Brinton, Redfield, U. 



C. Smith, Ives, Holstein and Le Boutillier. 



Eleven members and four correspondents have been elected. The 

 deaths of thirteen members and two correspondents have been an- 

 nounced and two members, Messrs C. L. Kilburn and Rev. Geo. 



D. Boardman, have resigned. 



The vacancy in the Council caused by the death of Mr. S. Fisher 

 Corlies was filled June 26, by the election of Mr. AYm. W. Jefferis. 



The following extract from the will of the late Geo. W. Tryon Jr. 

 was read at the meeting of Feb. 14, 1888 : — "I give to the Academy of 

 Natural Sciences of Philadelphia my collection of shells now deposited 

 with that society conditioned that they shall not be loaned or re- 

 moved from the immediate custody of the said Academy and of its 

 Conchological Section." The bequest was accepted on the condition 

 as stated. 



A bond of indemnity having been given Feb. 14 to the executors 

 of the estate of the late Mary R. D. Smith, the Academy was placed 

 in possession of the sum of $1201.49 the proportion of said estate 

 bequeathed to the society by Miss Smith. 



The thanks of the Academy were voted to Dr. Charles SchafFer for 

 his gift of S4939.58, the amount received by him as commissions 

 while acting as executor under the will of the late John Bryden to 

 whose estate, in accordance with the wish of Dr. Schafl'er, the gift 

 lias been credited. 



A like vote of thanks was tendered to Mr. Theodore D. Rand for 

 the gift of SIOO.OO, the amount received by him for professional 

 services in connection with the same estate. 



The Academy having considered a deed of trust executed by Mrs. 

 Emma W. Hayden for the endowment of the Hayden Geological 

 Fund of Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars, in memory of her hus- 

 band the late Prof. Ferdinand Y. Hayden, the interest of which to- 

 gether with a bronze medal is to be awarded annually for the best 

 publication, exploration, discovery or research in the sciences of 

 geology and paleontology, by a committee to be appointed by the 

 Academy, the said deed of trust was accepted by and ordered to be

■executed on behalf of the Academy, May, 1, 1888, and the following 

 resolution for the appointment of the required committee was 

 adopted : — 



Resolved — That a committee not exceeding five, to be ajipointed 

 under the deed of trust of Mrs. Emma W. Hayden, shall first be rec- 

 ommended by the Council of the Academy and shall be selected 

 from the members at large and their names submitted to a vote of 

 the Academy annually, and if said vote of the Academy shall show 

 their election, they shall act as such committee under said deed. 



The thanks of the Academy were ordered, November 20, to be 

 conveyed to Mrs. Clara Jessup Bloomfield Moore for her liberal addi- 

 tion of $5000.00 to the Jessup Fund endowed by her father, the late 

 A. E. Jessup. By subsequent action of the Council the entire amount 

 wa- ordered to be placed to the credit of that portion of the fund 

 ivhieh is appi'opriated to the assistance of young naturalists. 

 x\ll of which is respectfully submitted.

REPORT OF CORRESPONDING SECRETARY. 



The duties of the Corresponding Secretary during the pa.st year 

 have been neither important nor onerous. 



The correspondence has related mainly to the publications. of the 

 Academy, being either acknowledgments from corresponding socie- 

 ties or the usual letters transmitting their publications. 



The acknowledgments number sixty by letter and forty-three by 

 card, divided as follows : 



By card, American societies 23, Foreign 20. 

 By letter, American societies 15, Foreign 45. 



The letters of transmittal represent thirty-eight bodies, of which 

 but one is American. These, with the latter exception, are very 

 nearly all those continuing their send ings through the International 

 Exchange Agency. 



During the past year the duties of the office were kindly perform- 

 ed by the Curator-in-charge for five months in the interval of the 

 Secretary's absence abroad. 



An opportunity was afforded of seeing personally the officers 

 in charge of the libraries of some of our corresponding societies, and 




436 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888- 



of examining the series of our publications on their shelves. The 

 deficiencies which we could probably supply were indicated, as well 

 as those not at our disposition. 



All expressed themselves satisfied with the sending of our publica- 

 tions by mail and promised to do the same when the size of their 

 volume permitted. 



During the year there have been elected four Correspondents of 

 the Academy all of wdiom have been promptly notified. 



The duty of acknowledging donations to the museum which by the 

 by-laws, devolves on the Corresponding Secretary, has been assum- 

 ed by the Curator-in-charge. The Corresponding Secretary 

 would again suggest such modification of the laws as will render 

 this legal. The reasons for the change are too obvious to need ex- 

 2:)lanation.

The appended list of additions will indicate more specifically the 

 nature of the year's increase. 



We have procured from the publishers in Germany the parts 

 lacking in the set of De INFartius, Flora Brasiliensis, received last year 

 from the Brasilian Government, and the work is now complete as 

 far as issued. 



The revision of the catalogue of Journals, commenced last year, has 

 been completed with the exception of the Scandinavian and Russian 

 publications. It is hoped that the entire work may be finished be- 

 fore the end of the year. 



With the assistance of Signor Fronani, whose services I have been 

 again enabled to secure, two hundred and thirty-four letters asking 

 for supply of deficiencies, were sent in September to foreign societies. 

 ■Seventy-four answers have already been received and the increase of 

 accessions over those recorded last year is mainly, if not altogether, 

 due to the liberality of our correspondents in supplying us with the 

 volumes and parts asked for. 



The card catalogue, exclusive of periodicals, was completed early 

 'in the year and the geographical entries of journals have also been 

 finished. Cross references and title entries of the latter are now in 

 ■course of preparation. This will complete the catalogue within its 




438

[18S8„ 



present scope which, it will be remembered, provides for author en- 

 tries only in the special departments, with a few exceptions such as 

 official geological reports and scientific explorations which are also 

 catalogued under the names of the regions described. It is of the 

 utmost importance that the preparation of a subject catalogue be un- 

 dertaken as soon as possible, for while most of our readers know 

 their authors, a properly classified index to the broader subdivisions 

 of speciol departments of the library would result not only in a sav- 

 ing of time but in a more thorough and reliable acquaintance with 

 the work already done. To complete such a catalogue within any 

 reasonable limit of time, the employment of skilled assistance will be 

 absolutely necessary, and, it is to be regretted, the Academy at pre- 

 sent is unable to incur this expense. An effort will be made, how- 

 ever, with such clerical aid as the librarian may be able to secure, to- 

 go on as far as possible with the work in the time at his disposal 

 during the year. Progress will necessarily l)e very slow, in c(5nse- 

 (juence of many unavoidable interruptions. 



Since the last report 321 volumes have been bound, including 08 

 volumes of pamphlets, and 45 volumes are now in the hands of the 

 binders. 



A careful enumeration of the library was made at the beginning 

 of November. There are, bound and unbound, 30831 volumes at 

 present on the shelfs, including 615 bound volumes of pamphlets. 

 The latter embrace 8621 separate titles. To these may be added 

 1445 volumes in the library of the Entomological Section. Many 

 of these are, however, duplicates of those in the main library. The 

 latter are divided as follows : —

Rp:P()irr of the curators. 



The Curators present the following statement of the Ciirator-in- 

 Charge, Prof, ileilprin, us their report for the year 1888 : — 



The Curator-in-Charge respectfully reports that the collections of 

 the Academy are in good condition, and that their status, as far as 

 classification and arrangement are concerned, has been materially 

 improved during the year As heretofore, the Academy has prof- 

 ited largely through the work ot volunteer specialists, and is 

 hence placed under special obligation to those who have thus gen- 

 erously contributed their time and assistance. To Mr. J. H. Red- 

 field, Conservator of the herl^arium, and to Mr. Thomas Meehan, it 

 is almost wholly indebteil for the careful work that is being system- 

 atically applied toward the expansion and proper distribution of the 

 botanical collections; while to the oflicers of the Entomological Sec- 

 ti(m and of the American Entomological Society it is placed under 

 obligation for work done in connection with the department of ento- 

 mology. In the death of Mr. George W. Tryon, Jr., its Conservator 

 in the department of conchology for thirteen yeai's, the Academy 

 has lost one of its truest and most efficient members — one w'ho had 

 for a full quarter of a century given much of his daily time to the 

 interests of the institution. That the department will feel for some 

 time the w-ant of his vast experience, and the absence of his governing 

 influence, there can be no question ; but it is hoped that under 

 the special direction of the new conservator, Mr. H. A. Pilsbry, 

 and of the Conchological Section, it will be kept in that command- 

 ing position which it has so firmly and justly held. 



In the departments other than those here specified the work has 

 been done almost wholly under the direction of the Curator-in- 

 Charge and his assistant, Mr. J. E. Ives. As in preceding years the 

 alcoholics have been completely overhauled, and it is satisfactory 

 to be able to report that there has been practically no loss in this part 

 of the Academy's collections since the preparation of the last annual 

 statement. It is less agreeable to report that during the latter part 

 of the present year several attempts to force the ornithological cases 

 have been made, with the result of robbing the collection of some 200 

 specimens of South American and Australian birds, mainly repre- 

 sentatives of the family Tanagridae. The greater number of these 

 have been recovered, and it now seems that the full loss resolves it- 

 self to possibly not more than a half-dozen specimens. A change 




440 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



in the constriietiou of the locks is urgently needed, and it is recom- 

 mended that steps looking toward the greater security of the cases 

 be immediately taken. The ornithological collections have largely 

 profited during the year through the labors of Mr. Witmer Stone, 

 who has, amidst other work, very carefully reviewed the extensive 

 and intricate family of the Tanagridse, and determined the greater 

 number of the species that belong to this group. His work shows 

 that the Academy's representation is a very full one, falling, in point 

 of species, but little short of that of the British Museum. A nu- 

 merical estimate of the entire collection of mounted birds in the 

 Academy shows it to comprise somewhat more than 23,000 speci- 

 mens; in addition to this there is a collection of some 3000 skins. 



The work of systematically cataloguing this vast collection has 

 been begun, but much time must necessarily elapse before such a 

 catalogue can be satisfactorily completed. 



The entire nuiseum collection of minerals has been rearranged 

 during the year, tiie specimens of the different mineral species being 

 distributed strictly according to geographical position. This meth- 

 od, it is believed, will largely facilitate con)j)arative study. The 

 Wm. S. Vaux collection continues to receive the close' and valuable 

 superintendence of its special Conservator, Mr. Jacob Binder, through 

 whom it has been brought into a condition of rare complete- 

 ness. A large proportion of the more commanding specimens which 

 now distinguish the collection have been obtained through ])urchase 

 on the special selection and recommendation of the Conservator. 



In most of the other departments of the museum the work has 

 been mainly of a general character. Mr. Ives, under the direction of 

 the Curator-in-Charge, has very carefully reviewed and redetermined 

 the species of Ophiuroidea and Asteroidea, and thereby added very 

 materially to the extent of the collection represented. Two new 

 species, a Pteraster and a Coronaster, were determined. 



By a resolution of Council of April it was I'ecommended that a 

 hand-book of the Museum be prepared by the Curator-in-Charge, in 

 conjunction with the members of the Board of Curators. In 

 conformity with this recommendation the Curator-in-Charge has de- 

 voted much time toward the preparation of such a hand-book, and it 

 gives him pleasure to report that the same is now almost finished 

 and readv to go to press. It is herewith submitted for approval to 

 the Board of Curators. 



The additions to the nuiseuiu during the year — detaile<l in the ac- 

 companying list of donations — have been both abundant and im])ort- 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 441 



ant. Through the kindness of Dr. H. C. Chapman the Academy has 

 receiv^ed a fine selection of marine invertebrates from Bar Harl)or, 

 Maine, many species of which had not hitherto been represented in the 

 general collection. The Zoological Society of Philadelphia has also 

 contributed largely in material from their gardens, and thereby filled 

 in many gaps that could not otherwise be readily closed. 



The trip to the Bermuda Islands which was planned by the Cura- 

 tor-in-Charge, and toward which the Academy generously contrib- 

 uted its assistance, proved successful beyond anticipation, and 

 has resulted in placing in the Academy's museum a large and im- 

 portant collection of sub-tropical marine forms, the greater number 

 of which are now for the first time represented, and many of 

 which are new to science. The results of the expedition, which 

 are now in course of publication in the Academy's Proceedings, 

 prove what benefits may be derived from zoo-geograj^hical research 

 •of this kind, undertaken with only moderate expense, and with 

 no special preparation. The value of this form of scientific re- 

 search has been indicated in previous reports, and attention is once 

 more directed to the advisability of endowing a moderate zoo-geo- 

 graphical research fund, the interest from which should be expended 

 annually in the exploration of the numerous regions which still 

 await investigation. It is believed that no other method could be 

 suggested which would yield such important scientific results, and at 

 the same time render the Academy a virtual centre of scientific ac- 

 tivity in the country. 



The Curator-in-Charge again desires to call attention to the ab- 

 solute need of an extensionto the present accommodations; the exist- 

 ing conditions are becoming more serious every year, and render a 

 change, if the efficiency of the institution is not to be lessened, im- 

 perative. The collections can no longer be advantageously increased, 

 nor can they be satisfactorily cared for in their restricted quarters. 

 Portions of the library are being gradually encroached upon, and 

 the work-rooms are all filled. The need for a suitable lecture-hall 

 or amphitheatre is pressing, and the same is true of special students' 

 rooms and laboratories. It is earnestly hoped that the generous 

 public of this city, who have so kindly lent their assistance before, 

 will not allow the most important institution of the kind in the 

 country to go in want. The attempts to obtain aid from the State, 

 although often repeated, have thus far proved abortive ; but an ef- 

 fort will again be made during the coming session of the Legisla- 

 ture. 




442 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [18S8. 



Attention is again called to the important question of Sunday 

 opening. The numerous requests for admission into the museum on 

 Sundays clearly speak the public mind, or at any rate, the wish of a 

 large number of the city's inhabitants. The Academy of the Fine 

 Art and the Zoological Society have set an example in the right 

 direction, and there seems to be no reason, beyond an inadequacy of 

 funds to maintain such opening, why our Academy should not fol- 

 low the lead. Sunday-opening would certainly be a charity to that 

 large body of useful citizens Avhose daily employment debars them 

 from the advantages which the institution otherwise oifers. 



During the year specimens for study have been loaned to Prof. 

 R. P. AVhitfield, of New York ; to Prof's. Osborn and Scott, ot 

 Princeton ; to Dr. G. Baur, of New Haven ; to Dr. George Marx, of 

 Washington ; and to Dr. Harrison Allen, of this city.

REPORT OF THE CTRATOR OF THE WILLIAM S. 

 YAUX COLLECTIONS. 



The Cui-ator of the William S. Yaux Collections respectfully sub- 

 mits his sixth annual report to the Council of the Academy. 



The collections are in good order and condition, the only change 

 made since the report of 1887, being the introduction of one hundred 

 and two specimens purchased within the year and added to the 

 collection. These specimens have been purchased at a cost of 

 $420.10. 



The collections now consist of the following : — 

 No. of minerals reported 1887, ..... 6,786 

 No. of minerals purchased 1888, 102 



Total, 6,888 



Archaeological specimens (same as reported in 1887), . 2,940

The growth of the collection, since it came into the Academy's- 

 possession is as follows : — 



Specimens purchased in 1884, ..... 60 



Specimens purchased in 1885, ..... 104 



Specimens purchased in 1886, ..... 114 



Specimens purchased in 1887, ..... 156 



Si:)ecimens purchased in 1888, ..... 102 



Total, 536 



The aggregate cost of the 536 specimens has been . $2506. 80 



Most worthy of mention among the additions of the year are a 

 fine specimen of Calcite in Malachite, a superb Vanadinite and 

 Wulfenite from Arizona; these specimens, in color and crystalo- 

 graphic form, are the finest ever brought to the city. Other inter- 

 esting specimens are a single crystal of Gadolenite 6 inches in width 

 by 9 inches in length, said to be the largest crystal ever found ; 

 fine large crystals, of Troostite, Tryolite, Erenite, Opal, Turquoise,. 

 Thenardite, Trona, Hyalite. Colemauite and others. 



A number of species not heretofore represented in the collection 

 have been added. 



The visitors to the collection have not been as numerous as in 

 former years ; it may be remarked, however, that those who do visit 

 it are persons especially interested in mineralogy or archaeology 

 who have made use of it more for the purpose of study than for the- 

 gratification of mere curiosity.

446 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888. 



REPORT OF THE COXCHOLOGICAL SECTION. 



The Recorder of the Conchological Section respectfully reports 

 that during the year ending Dec. 1st, 1888, the Academy has con- 

 tinued to publish such conchological papers as have been offered. 



Two members have been elected. The loss to the section by 

 -death has been the severest in its history. On January 21st, 1888, 

 our honored Treasurer, Mr. Wm. L. Mactier, was called from works 

 to reward, and we had hardly turned from paying our last tribute 

 of respect to his memory, when we were again summoned to perform 

 the same service for our beloved Conservator, the eminent Conchol- 

 ogist, George W. Tryou Jr. who died February 5th, 1888, while 

 yet in the prime of life. 



At a special meeting of the Section called for the purpose and 

 held February 22nd, 1888, appropriate minutes prepared by the 

 Director were adopted and by direction sent to the families of the 

 deceased. 



"William Laurence Mactier, a member of the Academy of Natural 

 Sciences of Philadelphia since Jan. 1860, was born in the city of 

 New York, May 28, 1818, and died at his home in this citv Jan. 21, 

 1388. 



His father, Henry Mactier, was a native of Scotland, and his 

 mother, a daughter of Augustine Hicks Laurence and Catherine 

 Luquer, was born in New York. 



Mr. Mactier had been prepared for admission into the College of 

 New Jersey, intending after completing his general education there 

 to devote himself to the medical profession. But unexpectedly, 

 conclusive reasons forced him to abandon the project, and seek a 

 more speedy route to a livelihood in mercantile affairs — he became 

 a man of business. The extent and character of his preliminary 

 education fostered in him a tastfe for letters which he cultivated 

 during his leisure so well that the College of New Jersey conferred 

 upon him the honorary degree of Master of Arts. 



Mr. Mactier was one of the constituents of the Conchological Sec 

 tion of the Academy ; and from the date of its institution, Dec. 26, 

 1866, was its treasurer. During twenty-two years he discharged all 

 the duties of the office efficiently and promptly. 



He served in the Council of the Academy, and was a member of 

 its Committee on Instruction and Lectures. 



He contributed $285 to the building fund, and was a member of 

 the Board of Trustees thereof. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENX'ES OF PHILADELPHIA. 447 



He was a member of the ^lusical Fund Society of Philadelphia, 

 and read a historical sketch of the institution before the Society 

 Jan. 29, 1885, which was published. He was treasurer of the So- 

 ciety from 1864 to 1880, — sixteen years — and vice-president since 

 1881. 



He was long a menibei' of the Philadelphia Atheneum. At forty- 

 six consecutive annual elections of the Philadelphia and Reading 

 Railroad Company he was one of the judges of the election. 



He was active in the Board of Publication of the Presbyterian 

 Church ; a Director of the " JNIercer Home ;" Secretary of the Pres- 

 byterian Hospital ; a member of the Deacon's Court, and associate 

 superintendent of the Sunday School of the Second Presbyterian 

 Church of Philadelphia. 



The position which he held, the work he did, are significant of his 

 friendliness to natural science, of his benevolence and public spirit 

 as well as of the excellence of his character. 



Resolved, That in the death of William L. Mactier the Concholog- 

 ical Section of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 

 has lost an estimable member and efficient treasurer, that, in testi- 

 mony of ajjpreciation of our loss and as a tribute to his memory, 

 this brief of his virtues be entered upon the record of Proceedings, 

 and that a coj)y thereof be transmitted to his family by the Re- 

 corder. 



The Director's extended and appreciative biographical notice of 

 Mr. TiTon is published in the present number of the Proceedings of 

 the Academy. 



Our Conservator, JMr. H. A. Pilsbry, reports: — ■ 

 "The principal additions to the museum consist of suites of Medi- 

 terranean shells from Malta and the Balearic fsles i-eceived from 

 Messrs B. Tomlin and Alfred Caruana ; of Sandwich Is. land 

 shells, a large series from 'Siv. Baldwin ; and new Tasmanian shells 

 from C. E. Beddorae. From the family of the late Wm. L. Mactier, 

 a number of interesting forms mostly of well known marine species. 

 A large number of American species have been received, among 

 ■which may be mentioned alpine land shells from Colorado, Florida 

 marine shells and a series of Texas shells. A full list of the dona- 

 tions are included in the " Additions to the Museum." 



The total number of additions made is 46, amounting to 603 trays, 

 3455 specimens. The collection now contains 192,605 specimens in 

 51,930 trays. A valuable series of alcoholic specimens has been re- 

 ceived from Mr. Brvant Walker, Detroit, Mich. In the museum,

the arrangement of the families Neritidce, Phasianellidce and Turhi- 

 nidce has been nearly completed." 



No changes have been made in the By-Laws of the Section. 

 The officers of the Section for 1889 are : — 



Director, .... AV. S. W. Ruschenberger.

REPORT OF THE BOTANICAL SECTION. 



The Vice-Director of the Botanical Section respectfully reports a 

 continued interest on the part of the members. The membership 

 continues about as heretofore, the meetings have been regularly at- 

 tended, and many facts of great interest brought to the attention of 

 the Section and discussed by the members. The Section is out of 

 debt with a small surplus in its treasury. 



The officers elected for the year ensuing are : — 



Director, .... Dr. W. S. W. Ruschenberger. 



Vice-Director, . . . Thomas Meehan. 



Becorder, .... Dr. Charles Schaffer. 



Cor. Secretary and Treasurer, . Isaac C. !Martindale. 



Conservator, .... John H. Redfield. 

 A most gratifying announcement is the completion of the great 

 task of mounting all the specimens in the herbarium of North 

 American plants as covered by Grays Synoptical Flora. This Avas 

 commenced in 1878, by the Conservator, Mr. John H. Redfield, as- 

 sisted at various times by Messrs. F. Lamson Scribner, Isaac Burk 

 and the late Charles F. Parker. 



The encouraging growth of the herbarium noted in our former 

 annual reports, still continues. The large number of 1039 species 

 were added to our former list, making 28,306 as the total number 

 of species of vascular plants represented in the herbarium. 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 449 



The Conservator's report to the Section, giving the details of these 

 additions, is added as a part of this report. 



Respectfully submitted, 



Thomas Meehan, 



Vice-Director. 



Conservator's Report for 1888. — The Conservator of the Botanical 

 Section reports that during the year closing Dec. 10th, the additions 

 to the herbarium consist of 2525 species, of which 2296 are vascular 

 plants, and 229 are Lichens, Fungi and Algje. Of the 2296 species 

 of vascular plants 1040 are believed to be new to our collection, 77 

 of them being of genera not before represented. 693 species are 

 Xorth America, 1414 are from Tropical America, 171 from the East- 

 ern Continent, and 18 are Australian. 



It is gratifying to know that the rate of increase has not declined, 

 and that so large a portion of it is of forms not previously represent- 

 ed. 



The most important addition of the past year is the completion of 

 the collections made by Dr. H. H. Rusby in Bolivia and the neigh- 

 boring regions in 1885 and 1886, consisting of 983 species of which 

 nearly 600 are believed to be new to us. Including the portion of 

 this collection received by us the previous year, the whole consists 

 of 1433 species. These have been contributed by members of the 

 Section, supplemented by the proceeds of duplicate plants sold by 

 its order. Other valuable additions to our representation of the 

 flora of Tropical America are — 266 species collected by C. G. 

 Pringle in the Province of Coahuila, Mexico, and 100 species 

 collected in the INIexican Province of Tabasco and presented by Sr. 

 Jose N. Rovirosa, from whom we have reason to expect further con- 

 tributions. 



The number of species of vascular plants in the herbarium of the 

 Academy, at the date of the last report, was estimated at . 27,267 

 to which add the accession of new species of this year . 1,040 

 giving the estimated present total ..... 28,307 

 of which 8200 are North American, that is from the region covered 

 by Gray's Synoptical Flora. 



In INIay last was completed the work of mounting the special 



herbarium of North American plants. This work was begun in 



1878, and has been continued from year to year in the intervals, of 



other duties. In this the Conservator received most efficient aid 



30

from the late Charles F. Paijier, from F. L. Scribner and more recent- 

 ly from Mr. Isaac Burk. 



A complete list of the additions to the herliarium is appended, 

 and will appear in its proper place under the head of "Additions to 



the Museum." 



Respectfully submitted, 



John H. Redfield, 



Conservator. 



REPORT OF THE MINERALOGICAL AND 

 GEOLOGICAL SECTIOX. 



The Director of the Mineral and Geological Section of the Acad- 

 emy of Natural Sciences, would respectfully report that meetings of 

 the section have been held nearly every month during the year except 

 the summer months. Some of these have been quite Avell attended, 

 at others the attendance has been small. On the whole, he 

 regrets to say, ^e itnterest has not been as great as in former years, 

 but this has been largely due to ab.«ence of active members from 

 causes beyond their control. 



The meetings during the latter ])art of the year have been better 

 attended and more interest has been manifested than in the earlier 

 part, so that the outlook is more favorable. 



The following officers were elected to serve during the ensuing 

 year : — 



Theodore D. Rand. 

 Dr. W. S. W. Ruschenberger. 

 John Ford, 

 William W. Jefferis. 

 Dr. Charles SchafFer. 

 Respectfully submitted,

REPORT OF THE PROFESSOR OF INVERTEBRATE 

 PALEONTOLOGY. 



The Professor of Invertebrate Paleontology respectfully reports 

 that he has during the year delivered a course of lectures on geology 




1888.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 451 



Avhicli, as heretofore, lias been illustrated or supplemented with prac- 

 tical field demonstrations. He has also delivered in the hall of the 

 Academy, a number of lectures before the Teachers' Institute of this 

 •city, and contributed four lectures to the Friday Evening course of 

 the Academy. During the month of July be conducted a class in 

 the exploration of the Bermuda Islands, which had hitherto I'eceived 

 but little attention from naturalists. The inquiry extended as well 

 to the zoological as to the geological features of the island group, 

 and has resulted in bringing to the museum a rich store of materi- 

 al, the greater part of which is new to the collections. The details 

 of the exploration, to which reference is also made in the Curator's 

 Report, are being published in the Academy's Proceedings. 



The collections in the department of Invertebrate Paleontology re- 

 main pretty much as they w^ere last year. A number of additions, 

 but none of any great significance, have been received. Perhaps 

 the most valuable of these is a collection of cretaceous plants from 

 Kansas, obtained from C. H. Sternberg in exchange for certain vol- 

 umes of the Academy's Proceedings. Mention should also be made 

 of a fine selection of crinoids from the Carboniferous formations of 

 the central United States, generously given to the Academy by 

 Messrs. Wachsmuth and Springer, of Burlington, Iowa. 



The general condition of the collections is good. But here as in 

 almost all other departmeuts of the Academy's Museum, additional 

 accommodations are badly needed. 



Respectfully submitted, 



Angelo Heilprin, 

 Professor of Invertebrate Paleontology. 



REPORT OF THE PROFESSOR OF ETHNOLOGY AND 

 ARCHiEOLOGY. 



During the past year the course of lectures usually delivered by 

 nie was omitted owing to my absence from the city. 



The collections have received some but not extensive additions in 

 this department. It would be desirable and would benefit this 

 branch of instruction were all the ethnologic objects in the possess- 

 ion of the Academy arranged and classified separately from the 

 other collections, and according to the ethnic method of display. To 

 accomplish this the exclusive use of sufficient space would be needed 




452 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1888, 



to exhibit the objects and allow room to fill the lacuiije in the col- 

 lection. At present, this does not appear to be within the power of 

 the Academy ; but it seems proper to state that such an arrange- 

 ment is very desirable so that it may receive consideration in any 

 future extension of the Society's building. 



Respectfully submitted,

 Professor of Ethnology and Archceology-
