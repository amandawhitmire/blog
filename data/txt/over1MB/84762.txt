The Calaveras Skull. — Mr. William H. Dall called attention 

 to the fact that the authenticity of the celebrated Calaveras skull, 

 about which so much controversy had arisen in 1866, has recently 

 again been called in question. It seemed to him, as the small 

 number of persons who were cognizant of the facts when they 

 occurred is already greatly reduced, that it would be desirable to 

 put on record his own testimony as an eyewitness to some of them, 

 which in his opinion are incompatible with the theory that a hoax 

 had been perpetrated, or a skull from some recent burial place 

 subject to the lime deposit from springs, fraudulently foisted upon 

 Prof. J. D. Whitney and his associates in the State Geological 

 Survey. 1 



Mr. Dall described briefly the nature of the formations which 

 make up the table mountains of the region alluded to, consisting 

 of beds of basaltic lava more or less alternated with gravel, which 

 fill the prehistoric stream beds in which gold was sought by means 

 of tunnels from the side, or shafts from above, and which are now 

 practically abandoned since the returns do not pay for the labor. 



He was in California at the time of the discovery and in June, 

 1866, examined the skuil, then in the office of the State Geolo- 

 gist, in the presence of Prof. Whitney, William M. Gabb, W. 



1 The main facts as thoroughly investigated at the time are given by 

 Prof. Whitney in his work on the auriferous gravels of California, Memoirs 

 of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Cambridge, Vol. vi, Part 1, 

 pp. 267-273, 1879. The evidence has generally been regarded among 

 scientific men as convincing and sufficient, the skull being shown by analy- 

 sis to be in a fossilized condition, and to have been taken, according to his 

 own statement, by a mine owner of respectability, from a bed of gravel 132 

 feet below the surface of the uppermost lava bed of Bald Hill, one of the 

 ''table mountaius" of Calaveras County, Cal., and to have been so covered 

 with cemented gravel that it was not recognized as a skull until the party 

 to whom the original finder had given it in his presence, removed some of 

 the covering, and that it passed without fee or reward into the hancis of 

 the State Geologist, who with his colleagues immediately investigated all 

 the circumstances. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 3 



Ashburner, Dr. James Blake and others, of whom the speaker is 

 the only present survivor. 



The skull was then in the condition in which it was first ob- 

 tained, except that a portion of the gravel which had originally 

 covered the whole of it had been removed by Messrs. Mattison 

 and Scribner (the finder and first receiver) from the anterior dome 

 and right side of the cranium. The rest of it was still filled or 

 covered by a hard mass of small gravel stones cemented together 

 by iron oxide and calcareous cement, so that a tool was necessary 

 to separate or remove the pebbles and other particles of which the 

 conglomerate was made up. These pebbles were obviously water- 

 worn, and mixed with them were particles of other human bones, 2 

 a perforated shell ornament or bead of small size and the fossilized 

 remains of a thin and fragile snail shell, recognizable as the still 

 existing Helix (Epiphragmophora) mormonum. 



It was the speaker's opinion that by no artificial agency could such 

 a conglomerate have been assembled about a recent skull, and the 

 sight of it was sufficient proof of the fact to any reasonable person. 

 Unfortunately, however, no photographs were taken of the 

 specimen in this condition, or at least none are recorded ; and when 

 it was placed in the hands of the celebrated anatomist, Dr. Jeffries 

 Wyman, the encrusting material was removed in order that the 

 characters of the skull should be determined. The specimen is 

 now in the Museum of Comparative Zoology, and it is probable 

 that part of the matrix is also preserved there. At all events the 

 recollection of the speaker was clear that the mass of the hard 

 incrusting conglomerate was composed of small pebbles, with some 

 ferrugiuous matter, entirely unlike the calcareous deposits from 

 calciferous water in caves. The mass of the material was not 

 limy, but gravel; in all essentials resembling the material taken 

 from the gravel beds under the lava, of which specimens were at 

 hand for comparison. Subsequent examination showed that the 

 skull had been violently fractured and that portions of bones 

 of the extremities and sternum had been crowded into its inter- 

 stices with the gravel. It was found among a lot of wood also 

 included in the gravel, as if the prehistoric stream in flood had 

 washed away part of an ancient graveyard and crushed the bones 

 and timber into a miscellaneous heap of debris, left behind, as the 

 waters fell. 



If, as has been intimated, the skull had been taken from some 

 cave where the present Indians interred their dead, and where 

 remains had been gradually covered with a stalagmitic crust, how 

 is the peculiar agglomeration to be explained ? 



In the speaker's opinion, the attempts on the part of unscientific 



2 Part of which from their size must have belonged to another individual.

persons of the vicinity to discredit the authenticity of the skull 

 after it had attracted general attention were due to that spirit, 

 unfortunately too common among ignorant persons, which leads 

 them to disparage that in which they have no share. As the per- 

 sons chiefly concerned made no attempt to utilize the discovery as a 

 source of profit, and the coming of the specimen into scientific hands 

 was due to circumstances which could not have been foreseen, the 

 speaker believed that so far, no sufficient reason had been adduced 

 for doubting the genuine character of the skull and its original 

 situs below the lava; though the question of the coexistence of 

 man and the extinct mammals whose remains have been found in 

 the same gravels is entirely distinct and may reasonably be left 

 open.

A STUDY OF THE TYPE SPECIMENS OF BIRDS IN THE COLLECTION OF 



THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 



WITH A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE COLLECTION. 



BY WITMER STONE. 



The ornithological collection of the Academy of Natural Sci- 

 ences of Philadelphia has long been known as one of the largest 

 and most important in the world. It Avas reported by Dr. P. L. 

 Sclater in 1857 to be " superior to that of any museum in Europe 

 and therefore the most perfect in existence." 1 



Early ornithological activity in America naturally centred 

 around this collection, and we rind the names of all our earlier 

 ornithologists connected with the Academy specimens, while the 

 majority of their publications appeared in the Proceedings of the 

 society. 



Having been engaged for some years in cataloguing the collection 

 and in identifying the type specimens which it contains, I wish to 

 present in the present contribution the results of my investigations 

 in order to record exactly what types are preserved, and the prob- 

 able history of others which were supposed to be in this collection. 

 The collection of bird> was begun soon after the foundation of the 

 Academy in 1812, and by the year 1837 contained about 1,000 

 specimens ; these were contributed by various members, among 

 whom Dr. Harlan, Dr. Trudeau and J. K. Townsend are best 

 known to ornithologists, though Dr. Thomas McEwen seems to 

 have been most active in the care of the collection. 



During the succeeding ten years the additions amounted to about 

 550 specimens, received from John Cassin, S. F. Baird, A. L. 

 Heermann, S. W. AVoodhouse, Dr. Watson and R. C. Taylor. 



In 1846 Dr. Thomas B. Wilson, afterwards President of the 

 Academy, became interested in the collection, and took steps to 

 enlarge it at his own expense. He entered into arrangements with 

 a European dealer to furnish him with specimens of such species

 of the Acad, of Nat. Sci. Phila. *' An interesting account of the collection.

as the Academy lacked in lots of one hundred at so much per 

 specimen, but upon asking the advice of Dr. J. E. Gray, of the 

 British Museum, as to the terms asked, he was strongly advised to 

 abandon this plan and to purchase an entire collection, several of 

 which were then on the market, that of Victor Massena, Due de 

 Rivoli, Prince d'Esling, being especially recommended. 



Accordingly Dr. Gray was authorized to proceed to Paris and 

 secure the collection, which he promptly did, much to the chagrin 

 of De Blainville and other French naturalists, who had fully 

 expected that the French government would purchase the collec- 

 tion. 2 



The Rivoli collection, numbering about 12,500 specimens, 

 arrived in Philadelphia in September, 1846, and was deposited by 

 Dr. Wilson with the Academy ; the old collection being merged 

 with it. 3 



Dr. "Wilson followed this purchase with that of the Bourcier 

 collection of Parrots and Tanagers, while his brother, Mr. Edward 

 Wilson, of London, 4 who was also interested in building up the 

 collection, purchased many small colled ions from J. and E. Ver. 

 reaux and other dealers, including a number of specimens from the 

 museum of Temminck. 



In the following year two more collections were purchased for 

 Dr. Wilson in London: the Gould collection of Australian birds 

 and the Boys Indian Collection. 



The former formed the basis of Gould's magnificent work on 

 the birds of Australia, and contained nearly all of his types of 

 Australian birds. It was always Gould's desire that this collection 

 should become the property of the British Museum, and he ottered 

 it to the trustees for the moderate sum of £1000. His offer was, 

 however, refused, and his disappointment was so great that in a 

 moment of chagrin he disposed of it to Dr ; Wilson. 5 



The Boys collection consisted of a full series of the species col- 

 lected by Capt. Boys, of the British army, during several years' 



2 See Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist., 1869, Vol. iii, p. 317. 



3 See Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1846, pp. 75, 128, 131, 343. 



* Mr. Wilson was the immediate agent of his brother in the purchase of 

 the Rivoli and other foreign collections.

residence in India. The duplicates of his collection were dispersed 

 at auction, and Dr. Wilson obtained the only full set. 6 



Neither of these collections reached the Academy for a year or 

 two afterward, the Gould collection being placed in Yerreaux's 

 hands for mounting and the Boys collection being loaned to Mr. 

 Gould for use in preparing his Birds of Asia. 



While Dr. Wilson was bringing together his enormous collec- 

 tion, many smaller additions were being made to the Academy' s 

 .« eries. 



Between the years 1846 and 1860 the collections of Gambel, 

 (a-sin, Edw. Harris, Kern, Krider, Dr. Kane, T. C. Henry, Dr. 

 Heermann, Dr. Woodhouse and McCall were received, and mate- 

 rial:}' increased the collection of North American birds. 



On March 20, 1860, Dr. Wilson formally presented his entire 

 collection, then estimated at 26,000 specimens, to the Academy. 



The next ten rears show comparatively little increase in the 

 collection, the most important additions being the African bird- 

 received from the DuChaillu expeditions which were sent out 

 partly under the auspices of members of the Academy, 7 and the 

 D'Oca collection from Mexico. 



Quite a number of specimens were received at this time by gift 

 and exchange from the Smithsonian Institution. With the death 

 of Dr. Wilson in 1865, and of John Cassin in 1869, active orni- 

 thological work at the Academy ceased, and with the exception of a 

 few scattered specimens, no addition of importance was made to the 

 collection until 1887. 



The accessions since that date, as shown in the appended list, 

 have been extensive and number to date about 17,500 specimens. 



In the absence of any catalogue of the individual specimens, 

 Cassin' a estimate of the collection in 1860 can only be regarded as 

 approximate, and seems to have been too great. He states that 

 there were about 29,000 specimens in the collection at that time, 

 while up to 1887, 2,500 more were received, but our catalogue of 

 the specimens in the museum in 1887 shows only 25,945. 



While no doubt a number of specimens were lost or exchanged, 

 it seems hardly possible that as many as five thousand were dis-

8 In Proc. Acad. Nat. Sei., 1860, p. 86, the Wilson collection is stated as 

 consisting of 26,000 mounted specimens and 2,000 skins. I feel convinced, 

 however, that this is an error and that the estimate of 26,000 as given in 

 detail by Cassin on the next page includes the ' ' 2,000 skins." The Academy- 

 collection at that date numbered about 3,000 specimens.

As the collection was left by Dr. Wilson and John Cassin it \vas 

 nearly all mounted and on exhibition in museum cases in accord- 

 ance with the ideas prevalent at that time. 



Since then, however, it has been clearly demonstrated that 

 mounted specimens have but a limited existence, and sooner or later 

 succumb to the ravages of light and dust, and for years the bulk 

 of all the large collections has been preserved as skins in air-tight, 

 light-proof cases. In accordance with this idea, the rearrangement 

 of the Academv's collection was begun in 1891, and all the types 

 and other valuable specimens as well as many duplicates have been 

 unmounted, and placed in tight cabinets, leaving an ample exhibi- 

 tion series of about 10,000 specimens. Xearly all the recent addi- 

 tions have been skins and have been added to the study series. 



In the list of type specimens contained in the Academy collection 

 which follows, the species are arranged according 1o authors. In 

 order to make the paper more complete, however, mention is made 

 of every author who described new species of birds in the Acad- 

 emv's publications, whether their types are in the collection or not, 

 and the present location of the types, so far as known, is indicated.

Along with the above have been grouped the following Amer- 

 ican writers: Wilson, Audubon, Say, Xuttall, Cabot, Bryant and 

 Krider, some of whose types are in the collection, but who pub- 

 lished elsewhere than in the Academy's journals. The sequence 

 is nearly chronological.

 and Xew World, is placed at the end of this list, and following 

 him are considered Peale's types and those of the various foreign 

 authors contained in the collections purchased by Dr. Wilson, i. e. , 

 Jardine, Strickland, Massena, Verreaux, Lafresnaye, Sir A. Smith, 

 Gould, Lesson, Yieillot, Eytou, Heine, Prevost and Knip. 



In nearly every case I have selected one specimen as the type in 

 cases where the describer did not make a selection, giving prefer- 

 ence to the male over the female if both are described. This prac- 

 tice seems preferable to considering all the specimens of the original 

 lot to be " cotypes, " especially as it is often impossible to ascer- 

 tain how many of the specimens were in the describer' s possession 

 at the time the diagnosis was prepared. 



However, in order to be as accurate as possible, I have, in even- 

 case, included mention of all the specimens which might be con- 

 sidered as " cotypes " or " paratypes," whether in the Academy's 

 collection or not, so that those Avho do not agree in the above 

 practice will find all the evidence before them. 



Care in selecting a definite type and referring to it in the original 

 publication cannot be too highly commended, as the confusion and 

 difficulties that are presented by the carelessness of the older 

 writers in this respect are only too apparent after having completed 

 a study such as this. 



The species are entered under the names by which they are gen- 

 erally known at the present time, the nomenclature following the 

 American Ornithologists' Union Check List in the case of North 

 American birds, and the British Museum Catalogue, in the main, in 

 the case of foreign birds. 



It is probable that some names here regarded as synonyms in 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 11 



accordance with current usage will eventually prove tenable, but to 

 decide all such cases in a publication of this kind is manifestly 

 impossible. 



After the current name is given the name which the type repre- 

 sents and the reference to the original description, followed by the 

 catalogue number and data of the type specimen and "paratypes." 



Where specimens are stated to be in the British Museum, U. S. 

 National Museum or other institution, the information is quoted 

 respectively from the Catalogue of Birds, Baird, Cassin and Law- 

 rence, Birds of North America, or the various descriptions of the 

 authors themselves. 9 



AlexaxdePv Wilson. 



It is probable that all of Wilson's types that were preserved 

 were deposited in Peale's Museum. The collections there contained 

 were dispersed at auction upon the breaking up of the museum 

 and such Wilson specimens as may have been there are probably 

 lost. 



Two of the types were, however, obtained in exchange by the 

 Academy before the Peale collection was scattered. These are as 

 follows: 



Buteo latissimus (Wilson.) 



Falco latissimus "Wils. Am. Ora., vi., 1812, p. 92, pi. 54, fig. 1. 



1,551. " Original specimen figured by "Wilson." 

 Ictinia mississippiensis (Wilson). 



Falco mississippiensis Wils. Am. Orn., iii, 1811, p. 80, pi. 25, fig. 1. 



2,032. "Original specimen figured by "Wilson." 



Thomas Say. 



Say's types collected on Major Long's expedition to the Kocky 

 mountains were apparently all deposited in Peale' s Museum, and 

 many of them are figured in Bonaparte's American Ornithology 

 and definitely referred to by the Museum numbers. 



As in the case of most of Wilson's types, they have been entirely 

 lost sight of. There is no evidence that any of them came into 

 possession of the Academy. 10 



9 Some data were also kindly furnished by Dr. C. W. Richmond, of the 

 U. S. National Museum. 



10 Early references to the "Philadelphia Museum " refer to Peale's 

 Museum, which bore this name after its reorganization, and not to the 

 Academy, as is often supposed. 




12 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



Charles L. Bonaparte. 



Bonaparte's types, described in his American Ornithology, were 

 either deposited in Peale's Museum or in his own collection. 

 None of them appear to have been in the Academy collection, nor 

 is there any trace of the types of several species described in the 

 Journal of the Academy, 1824-1827. 



Several of his types of foreign birds were, however, received in 

 later years from Verreaux or Massena. A list of them follows: 



Nothocercus Julius (Bp.). 



Tinamus Julius Bp. Compt. Rend., xxxvii (1853), p. 633. 



12,914. rj" Colomlra. From Verreaux. Type. 

 Platycercus amathusiae (Bp.). 



P/titycercus atnathusise, Bp. Compt. Rend., xxx (1850), p. 133. 



22,860. Australia. Typt . 



Bonaparte quotes " Gould MSS." as authority for this species, 

 but Gould had not at that time published the species, and when he 

 did, in 1855 (Pt. 2, p. 166) he used another name, P. cyanogenys, 

 so that Bonaparte remains as the authority for the species. Gould's 

 type is in the British Museum. 



Ortygometra verreauxi (Bp. ) Compt. Rend., xliii. pp. 599, 600. 

 Ortygometra sclateri (Bp.) Compt. Rend., xliii, pp. 599, 600. 



These are nomina nuda so far as I can ascertain. The species 

 were later published by Sclater and Salvin as O. castaneiceps and 

 hauxwelli respectively. The " type specimens" of Bonaparte are 

 in the Academy collection received from Verreaux. 



Diphyllodes respublica (Bp.). See under Schkgelia wilsoni of Cassin. 



John K. Townsend. 



The new species of birds described by Townsend and Audubon 

 from the Columbia river and Bocky mountains Avere obtained on 

 an expedition undertaken by Townsend and Nuttall early iu 1834. 



Xuttall returned in October, 1835, via Hawaii and California, 

 arriving home in August, 1836, while Townsend spent another 

 year on the Columbia, visiting the South Pacific and Chile on his 

 return. 11 



jSTuttall met Audubon in Boston immediately after his return and 

 gave him such notes as he had made on the Western birds for use 

 in the Ornithological Biography. The only new birds which he seems 



11 See Narrative of a Journey Across the Rocky Mountains, etc. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 13 



to have obtained were Agelaius tricolor and Pica nuttallii. That he 

 did not collect more was parti } r due to the fact that he was mainly 

 engaged in collecting plants and partly, as Audubon states, to the 

 fact that " he was not in the habit of carrying a gun on his 

 rambles." 



Townsend made the main ornithological collection, and appar- 

 ently sent home by Nuttall all the specimens he had obtained up 

 to the date of his departure, as the collection was in Philadelphia 

 in 1836. Audubon, hearing of this, hastened to Philadelphia, 

 and was much disgusted because Townsend' s friends would not let 

 him describe the new species. An arrangement was, however, 

 effected by which the new birds were to be published by Nuttall 

 and Audubon in a paper in the Journal of the Academy under 

 Townsend' s name, and then to be figured in the Birch of America. 



And as a part of the same arrangement, Audubon (or Edward 

 Harris for him) purchased the duplicate specimens. i: 



The types of the species described by Townsend are most of 

 them still preserved in the Academy's collection. Tbe " dupli- 

 cates ' ' purchased by Audubon were afterwards given by him to 

 Edward Harris and Spencer F. Baird, and were eventually depos- 

 ited respectively in the Academy and in the U. S. National 

 Museum. 



In some cases there are specimens in the U. S National Museum 

 of species which are not now contained in the Academy's series, in 

 which case the former must be regarded as the types, otherwise the 

 Academy specimens seem to have the best claim to be so considered. 



The specimens collected by Townsend after Nuttall's departure 

 fall into another category. They were apparently I with a few 

 exceptions) sent direct to Audubon, 13 and were published by him 

 in his Ornithological Biography, Vol. v, the types being subse- 

 quently given to Harris and Baird along with the others. Most 

 of these are now in the Academy and National Museum, and the 

 question as to which should be considered the types naturally arises. 

 Fortunately there is only one species of which specimens are in both 

 institutions, i. e. , Dryohutes villosu.s harrisii, and of this there is 

 little difficulty in fixing the type.

 p. 159, Townsend insists that his name (tolmoei) should have 

 priority. In this he was correct, though the fact has been univer- 

 sally overlooked." 



Cinclus mexicanus Sw. 



Ginclus montana Towns. 



Cinclus townsendii "Audubon"' Towns. 



These two species are described in the Appendix to Townsend's 

 Narrative, p. 339, with reference to Audubon (Vol. iv, pi. 435). 

 The first is based upon a single male, the latter upon a female. 

 The descriptions were evidently prepared before Audubon's plate 

 and descriptions appeared with the understanding that he would 

 adopt the above names. He meanwhile, however, rightly sur- 

 mised that they were both identical with C. americanu* Sw. 

 {= mexicanus Sw.), and published them under that name ( Orn. 

 Biog., v, p. 303). 



The types may possibly be in the U. S. National Museum.

John James Audubon. 



The history of the Townsend specimens has been explained above 

 and it only remains to speak of such others of Audubon's types 

 as have found their way to the Academy's collection. 



Two of these, Colaptes ayersii and Caprimnlgus nuttallii, were 

 presented by Audubon himself in 1849. 



Columba trudeaui was obtained from J. G. Bell, and the others 

 were presented by Edward Harris in 1849, with the rest of his 

 collection. 



Cassin states that Harris' collection contains the types of Quis- 

 calus brcweri, Stumella neglecta, Fringilla harrisii, F. lincolni, u 

 Alauda spraguei, Emberiza bairdii and Vireo belli. 



Of several of these latter, Audubon also gave specimens to Baird, 

 and it is a question which of these shall be designated as the 

 types. In the list below I have included both the Academy and 

 National Museum specimens in all such cases. 



Considering first the species based on Townsend' s collection, we 

 find that two of those credited to Audubon in Townsend's list were 

 evidently so given by typographical error — Icterus gubernator and 

 Diomedia chlororhynca being already described by other authors. 



Icterus tricolor and Pica nidtalli (type 3,337, U.S.N.M. ) were 

 based on Nuttall's specimens, and Picus gairdnerii apparently on 

 one received from Gairdner or Nuttall, while the following were 

 names based on account of birds that had been seen but not secured, 

 and have no standing except Caprimulgus nuttallii, which was 

 rediscovered by Audubon himself in 1843, and properly described: 

 Phalacrocorax leucurus. Picus pyrrhonotu*. 



Phalacrocorax h "conotus. Tardus townsendii. 



Phasianus americanus. Caprimulgus nuttallii. 



15 Probably Cassin's error. A specimen from the Upper Missouri was pre- 

 sented by Harris, but Audubon's type came from Labrador and seems to be 

 lost. 




1890.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 17 



Of the other species, types of the following are in the U. S. 

 National Museum: 16 



Troglodytes parkmani (probably No. 66,644). 



Ptilogonys townsendii (No. 2,922). 



Sylvia delafieldii (No. 2,905). 



Sylvia macgillivrayi (No. 1,910). Lurus occidentals. 



Fringilla townsendii (No. 2,874). Diomedia fusca. 



Fringilla chlorura (No. 1,896). Phalacrocorax townsendii. 



Of the rest, the types are in the Academy collection, as follows,

Another in the U. S. National Museum does not correspond with 

 either of those mentioned by Audubon in date of capture, so that 

 it is probable that the above pair are those from which he drew his 

 description.

 was not Fringilla cinerea, of Gmelin. Audubon's description was 

 based upon one of Townsend' s specimens, which subsequently 

 came into the Academy's possession through Edward Harris, and 

 must of course be regarded as the type of Nuttall' s M. guttata.

These authors all described new species in the Academy's Pro- 

 ceedings (1852-1859) from collections made by them on the vari - 

 ons Government surveys, and while many duplicates from the 

 collections have been presented to the Academy by the Smithsonian 

 Institution, the types, with one exception, were retained.

Spencer F. Baird. 



While a majority of Prof. Baird' s new species were described in 

 the Academy's Proceedings, most of his types were the property 

 of the U. S. National Museum. Those in the Academy's collec- 

 tion are as follows : 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 23

 Anser frontalis Batrd. Bds. of X. Am., p 762. 

 6,05.5. New Mexico. Dr. T. C. Henry, marked by Cassin as " Type of

Two specimens are mentioned in the original description, and 

 this is evidently one of them.

 extant.

While the Academy specimen, 24,495. is mentioned in the 



description, the National Museum specimen, 23,954, seems to 



have the better claim to recognition as the type. 



George N. Lawrence. 

 As in the case of Baird, Lawrence was a frequent contributor to 

 the Proceedings, though most of his types were preserved else- 

 where. Only two are in the collection.

These authors all contributed diagnoses of new species to the 

 Proceedings, but onlj" two of their types are contained in the 

 Academy's collection.

Though credited to " Leyd. Mus., T. B. Wilson," Ridgway 

 seems to have been the first to publish this name. 



P. L. Sclater. 



Dr. Sclater described several new species in Jardine's Contribu- 

 tions to Ornithology, based on . specimens loaned him by Edward 

 Wilson. The types, however, seem to have been afterwards 

 secured by Dr. Sclater, and presented to the British Museum, and 

 never reached the Academy collection. 



Such species are: 



Euphonia frontalis. 

 Calliste lunigera. 

 Gallnte xanthogaslra. 



Some other specimens upon which he based dtscriptions were lost 

 in shipment to Philadelphia (see Contr. to Ornith., 1852, p. 59). 

 Besides the birds loaned to him by Edward Wilson, Sclater 

 described two new species during his visit to the Academy in 1856. 

 His types in the collection are as follows : 



Glaucidium gnoma californicum Scl.

Most of Dr. Bryant's types are presumably iu the collection of 

 the Boston Society of Natural History, but this specimen was sent 

 to the Academy immediately after it was described, and is distinctly 

 marked as the type.

This is the only one of Cabot's specimens in the Academy, and is 

 marked by Prof. Baird as the type. 



Johx Krider. 

 The well-known gunmaker and taxidermist of Philadelphia, 

 though a great collector, was not much of a contributor to ornitho- 

 logical literature, and the only species described by him was the 

 following, which proves to be merely a partly melanistic Common 

 Quail :

John Cassin. 



As the ornithologist of the Academy for over twenty-five years 

 of its greatest ornithological activitv, it is not surprising that Cassin 

 described more new species from the collection than any one else, 

 nor is it a matter of wonder that with such a collection constantly 

 at hand he pursued his studies among the birds of all parts of the 

 world with equal freedom. Cassin' s publications consisted mainly 

 of his papers in the Proceedings and Journal of the Academy. 



Besides these he published the Birds of California and Texas, 

 Birds of the Japan Expedition,™ U. S. Astronomical Expedition, 1 ' 

 the second edition of the Birds of the U. S. Exploring Expedition, 

 and contributed the Raptores, Gralhe and Alcidre to Baird's Birds 

 of North America. 



The types of new species described in the Government publica- 

 tions are all in the National Museum, while the vast majority of 

 those described in these Proceedings are in the Academy collection. 

 In a few of the species described in the latter, as well as those in 

 the Birds of California and Texas, he frequently says " specimens 

 in the Acad., Phila., and Nat. Mus., Wash.," which occasions 

 some ambiguity. In such cases I have' given preference to the Acad- 

 emy specimens as being probably those before him at the time of 

 writing, especially when these are labelled by Cassin himself, but 

 in some instances, as seen below, the National Museum specimens 

 have the better claim. 



A word of explanation as to Cassin' s connection with the Bird* 

 of the U. S. Exploring Expedition may not be out of place, as the 

 matter is not generally clearly understood. 



The original report was prepared by Titian R. Peale, who accom- 

 panied the expedition, but only ninety copies of this work were 

 issued. These which were distributed to the leading libraries but 

 without plates. Subsequently, in consideration of the impor- 

 tance of the work, a new report was prepared by Cassin, accom- 

 panied by a volume of plates which had been originally intended 

 to accompany the first edition. 



18 In these reports no new species are xiroposed. 




28 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



Cassia had the original Peale collection submitted to him upon 

 which to prepare his .report. These specimens were mainly 

 returned to the National Museum, but a small number, includiug 

 some types, were presented to the Academy. Peale' s work is 

 remarkable for the number of names it adds to the synouymy, for 

 out of 109 species described as new, only thirty-three are accepted 

 in Cassin's edition. The few novelties described by Cassin from 

 the collection are originally described in the Academy Proceedings. 



Cassin's types have been grouped geographically in the following 

 list and all the species proposed by him are included whether the 

 types are in the Academy or not.

This is probably a distinct species, as suggested by Stejneger

Titian R. Peale. 



Peale's descriptions of new birds are confined, so far as I am 

 aware, to the Ornithological and Mainmalogical Report of the U. S. 

 Exploring Expedition, he being one of the naturalists composing 

 the party. A. good deal of obscurity seems to envelop the history 

 of this publication. It is quite a rare volume. 



Some light is shed on the matter, however, by an article in Jar- 

 dine's Contributions to Ornithology, 1852, p. 89. It is here stated 

 that only one hundred copies of the Reports were issued by the 

 Government, but each author was permitted to order as many more 

 as he chose for his " personal benefit." All the contributors 

 availed themselves of this privilege, with the single exception of 

 Peale, but not one extra copy of his volume was issued, and the 

 work was never for sale. 



About ninety of the hundred copies were distributed by the Gov- 

 ernment, and the rest were destroyed by fire. Subsequently Cassin 

 was engaged to prepare a new edition of the work, and an atlas of 

 plates was issued to accompany it. No plates were issued with 

 Peale's report, though reference is made to plates in the text, and 




1899.] NATURAL BCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 45 



it is probable that many at least of the plates accompanying Cas- 

 sin's report were originally intended for Peale's, but were held 

 back when it was decided to republish the work. 



The new edition was desirable for many reasons, especially from 

 the fact that of the 109 new species described by Peale only about 

 thirty-three were entitled to recognition. 



It has been claimed by some that he was denied the opportunity 

 of consulting the collection at Philadelphia, but in any case his 

 report is a notorious addition to ornithological synonymy. 



While most of Peale's types remain in the National Museum, 

 some of them were presented to the Philadelphia Academy. 



A few more of these types are also in the Academy collection, 

 being contained in the collection made by J. K. Townsend in 

 Hawaii. Peale used this material, as most of the Hawaiian speci- 

 mens obtained by the Exploring Expedition were lost in the wreck 

 of the Peacock, 



The following list includes all of Peale's types now in the Acad- 

 emy collection. In some cases specimens of the same species are 

 preserved in the National Museum :

Jules and EdwaPvD Verreaux. 



Edward Wilson obtained a number of specimens from Verreaux 

 brothers, the famous Freuch bird dealers, and quite a number of 

 these were types of Verreaux' s species. 



The Verreauxs had the unfortunate practice of sending out speci- 

 mens with manuscript names which were often never published. 

 Many specimens loaned to Strickland by Mr. Wilson were of this 

 character, and, when describing any of them as new species, to 

 avoid coufusion he nearly always adopted Verreaux 's manuscript 

 names. In the case of a small collection from the interior of Ga- 

 boon, however, the Verreauxs, unknown lo Strickland, published 

 all the new species in the Revue et Magasin de Zoologie, while the 

 latter published them almost simultaneously in the Contributions 

 to Ornithology, fortunately using the supposed manuscript names 

 which he found on the labels. These doubly type(!) specimens 

 are as follows :

 as the Academy specimen is marked ' ' type ' ' by Verreaux.

F. DE Lafresnaye. 



Among the collections purchased by Dr. Wilson in Paris was 

 that of M. Delatre, obtained in Peru, Bolivia, Colombia and 

 Panama. This contained many novelties, and these were sub- 



mitted to Lafresnaye for publication before the collection was 

 shipped to America. His paper appeared in the Revue Zoologique, 

 March, 1847, pp. 67-79, and in it eighteen new species were 

 proposed. The types of all of these are preserved in the collec- 

 tion, and their study proves of interest, as some of Lafresnaye' s 

 names seem to have been entirely overlooked.

Lafresnaye and D'Orbigny. 



The types of the species usually credited to the above authors 

 are generally admitted to be the specimens in the Boston Society 

 of Natural History contained in the Lafresnaye collection. 



There are, however, specimens of many of them in the Academy 

 collection, which were originally in D'Orbigny' s collection, and 

 subsequently in that of Prince Massena, Due of Rivoli. These 

 were regarded by Cassin as types, and while they probably have 

 not as good a claim as those in the Boston Society they are in any 

 case paratypes, and are valued accordingly. 



Such specimens as are clearly labeled " D'Orbigny' s Collection " 

 are the following, though there are doubtless others among the 

 Rivoli specimens: 

 13,508. Columbigallina cruziana (d'Orb.). "Zacua No. 17, d'Orbigny."

Massena and Sonance. 



Apparently Prince Massena continued to collect specimens of the 

 Psittacidce after the disposal of his main collection to Dr. Wilson, 

 as in the Revue et Magasin de Zoologie for 1854", p. 71, there is a 

 paper under the joint authorship of Massena and Sonance 21 in 



21 Though both names appear as authors, Massena is given as authority for 

 all the species. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 53 



which are described nine new Parrots, while in the same journal 

 for 1856 there is a Catalogue of Parrots in the Massena collec- 

 tion, by M. Sonance, in which two hundred and eighteen species are 

 enumerated, some being described as new. 



The types of these latter species seem to have been purchased by 

 the British Museum, as with a few exceptions they are all listed in 

 the Catalogue of Birds in the British Museum, Vol. xx. The 

 Academy has no specimens of them from the Massena collection. 



Specimens of all but three of the species described in the former 

 of the papers above mentioned are, however, in the Academy's 

 collection labeled as types of " Massena and Sonance." 



As the original manuscript catalogue contains these specimens it 

 would seem that they were shipped about the same time as the rest 

 of the collection, which reached Philadelphia in 1846, in which case 

 the labels must have been written long before the names were pub- 

 lished. It is possible, however, that they were not sent over until 

 after the paper by Massena and Sonance was prepared. 



In any case, the specimens have practically as much claim to 

 being considered the types as those in the British Museum, and a 

 list of them is therefore appended.

John Gould. 



As already explained, Dr. Wilson secured Gould's entire collec- 

 tion of Australian birds, including nearly all of the types of species 

 described up to and including the seventh volume of his Birds of 

 Australia. The types of the species described in the supplement, 

 as well as such additional specimens as were procured after Dr. 

 Wilson's purchase, went to the British Museum. Several speci- 

 mens apparently from this subsequent collection are given in the 

 Catalogue of Birds, as types of species described long before Dr. 

 Wilson's purchase, whereas the Academy specimens have the better 

 claim, the others being, so far as I can judge, topotypes secured 

 some time afterward. There is no reason to suppose that Gould 

 withheld any of the specimens he possessed at the time of the sale. 



Gould's collection, after purchase, was sent to Yerreaux for 

 mounting, and the original labels were removed, and their contents, 

 (or part of it) transcribed on the base of the stands, every speci- 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 55 



men being marked " Type. Gould's Birds of Australia," no 

 matter whether the species was Gould's or not! 



Gould's original descriptions were for the most part published in 

 the Proceedings of the Zoological Society, and are generally very 

 meagre, so that it is impossible to tell how many of the numerous 

 ' ' type specimens ' ' of each species he had at the time he prepared 

 the diagnoses. 



By careful study and comparison with the original descriptions 

 it is possible to select the specimen which agrees in plumage, meas- 

 urements and locality with the description in nearly every case, 

 and such ones I have designated as the types. 



Of the 391 names proposed by Gould for Australian birds (in- 

 cluding those published in his Handbook) the types of 321 are in 

 the Academy collection. Of the rest, fifty-six are in the British 

 Museum, or other collections stated by Gould, while of fourteen 

 the actual type seems to have been lost, though paratypes or cotypes 

 are still preserved in the Academy. 



A complete manuscript catalogue of the Gould Australian speci- 

 mens has been prepared, and may be published at some future time. 



Below are given such of his types from localities other than 

 Australia as are preserved in the Academy collection:

Sir A. Smith. 



A number of specimens received from Jules Yerreaux are 

 marked by him both on the stands and in the catalogue " Type de 

 Smith," referring to the publications of Sir A. Smith in the Re- 

 port of the S. African Expedition and Illustrations of the Zoology of 

 South Africa. The types of most of Smith's species are recorded 

 as being in the British Museum, but where this is not the case the 

 Academy specimens must be considered as the types. No particu- 

 lars are preserved as to how many of Smith's specimens Dr. 

 Wilson procured. 



In all cases the Academy specimens are cotypes, and I therefore 

 give a full list of them below, which their importance seems to 

 warrant.

SYNOPSIS OF THE UNITED STATES SPECIES OF THE HYMENOPTEROUS 



GENUS CENTRIS Fabr. WITH DESCRIPTION OF 



A NEW SPECIES FROM TRINIDAD. 



BY WILLIAM J. FOX. 



This genus of bees is of tropical origin and, north of Mexico, is 

 only found along the extreme southern border of the United States. 

 Of the eleven species herein noted ten are from the region bor- 

 dering the Rio Grande, and one only is found east of Texas, C. 

 errans, from the vicinity of Biscayne Bay, Florida, a species prob- 

 ably introduced from the West Indies. Ten of these eleven species 

 have been first described within the past two years. 



The author is indebted to Mrs. A. T. Slosson and Messrs. Cock- 

 erel!, Ashmead and Griffith for the loan of material, which has 

 been of much assistance.

hind tarsal joint covered with appressed, fiery-red, or coppery, 

 bristles, oblong, truncate, longer and wider than the hind tibiae; 

 abdomen on first segment anteriorly, ventrally and at apex with 

 ><>me pale hairs, otherwise nude; wings subhyaline, a dark streak 

 in the marginal cell originating at base, aud a similar streak ex- 

 tending from the apex of the same cell in the form of an appen- 

 diculation. Length 12 mm. 



Florida: Biscayne Bay. Two specimens collected by Mrs. A. 

 T. Slosson, who, I believe, has other specimens of the species. C. 

 errans, whose origin is undoubtedly tropical, as the present speci- 

 mens should be considered wanderers from the West Indies, who 

 may or may not have taken up their abode in Florida, is most 

 closely related to C. apicalis and C. insularis from Saint Bartholo- 

 mew and St. Domingo respectively, with either of which it may be 

 identical, but from the descriptions of these two species the present 

 one differs in several respects, which may, however, be due to 

 lack of greater detail. 



2. Centris pallida n. sp. 



$. — Black, densely clothed with grayish white pubescence, that 

 on vertex and thorax above slightly pertaining to fulvous; median 

 and hind legs with black pubescence on tibiae and first tarsal joint; 

 remaining tarsal joints reddish; clypeus with a triangular yellow 

 mark; labrum covered with dense pile, that on base whitish, at 

 apex brownish; mandibles black, with pale pile at base externally; 

 first joint of flagellum slender, almost as long as the five following 

 joints; tegulse testaceous; fore tarsi fringed with pale fuscous hairs, 

 the pubescence of the inner side of first joint brownish; abdomen 

 with the pubescence of dorsal surface short, hoar- frost -like, except 

 on apical half of fifth segment where it is black; ventral segments 

 2-4 frinsred at apex with long white hairs, the fringe of segment 

 5 being dark brown; the ventral segments medially are supplied 

 with darker dense pubescence, which, when viewed from the side, 

 extends from hase of second segment to apex of fourlh; sixth 

 segment with brownish pubescence, the pygidium elongate, narrow, 

 reddish at base, with a broad flat fold or swelling running from 

 apex to near base; wings subhyaline. Length 16-17 mm. 



Arizona: Phojnix. Five specimens given to me by Dr. H. G. 

 Griffith, by whom they were collected in May, 1898, on Ihe flower- 




18ij9.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 67 



of the " Palo Verde," Parkinsonia Torreyana. Dr. Griffith states 

 the bees were abundant and easily captured, allowing the collecting 

 bottle to be slipped up quite close to them and the stopper then 

 used iu such a manner as to kDock them into the bottle. This 

 apparent lethargic condition of the specimens is quite unusual for 

 species of Centris, as from all accounts they are usually very rapid 

 flyers and easily disturbed, after the manner of Odonata. I can 

 testify from experience as to the alertness of two of the West In- 

 dian species, C. hcemorrhoidulls and C. fasciata. The abdomen is 

 densely pruinose above. 



3. Centris Morsei Ckll. 



Centris Morsei Cockerell, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1897, 355, r?. 

 New Mexico: Mesilla. Quite distinct by its large size (21 mm.) 

 and the pale reddish-yellow bands on dorsal segments 1 and 2. 



4. Centris marginata n. sp. 



tf. — Black; ventral segments laterally testaceous-yellow, all the 

 dorsals at apex broadly margined with testaceous; flagellum 

 slightly brownish beneath ; clypeus, labrum and spot between an- 

 tennae at base of clvpeus, bright lemon-yellow; mandibles reddish- 

 brown, with black tips; entire insect covered with pale gray pubes- 

 cence, except the abdomen above, which is quite bare, excepting 

 the extreme base of first segment; the pubescence inclining to 

 fulvous on top of head and thorax, and sufficiently thin on dorsu- 

 lum and mesopleura? to display the sculpture; front broad; first 

 joint of flagellum about as long as the three following united; legs 

 robust; pubescence of anterior tibia? and tarsi internally reddish- 

 brown, that on first joint of hind tarsi internally, dark; wings 

 subhyaline, nervures blackish. Length 16 mm. 



New Mexico: " Las Cruces (August 23) on flowers of Cevallia 

 simiata." One specimen received from Mr. Cockerell and bearing 

 the label " C. ccescdpinice d\" which name was probably attached to 

 it by error, as it neither agrees with the description of the male of 

 C. ccesalpinice, nor is it even closely allied to the female of that spe- 

 cies. Its affinities are to G. Morsei, from which it does not differ 

 structurally. 



5. Centris caesalpinise Ckll. 



Centris cmalpinim Cockerell, Ann. and Mag. N. H., Ser. 6, xix, 394, 

 9 C?, 1897. 

 New Mexico : Las Cruces. I have not seen the male of this 




68 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



specie?, a specimen received from Mr. Cockerell, marked " C. 

 ecesalpinice dV' differing so obviously from the description that I 

 have concluded that it was so labelled by mistake, and have de- 

 scribed it as new (see C. marginatum). 



6. Centris rhodopus Ckll. 



Centris ecesalpinice var. rhodopus Cockerell, Ibid., 395, 9 J\ 1897. 

 New Mexico : Las Cruces. It seems better to regard this as a 

 distinct species from C. ecesalpinice; it has well-marked differences. 

 One male, sent by Mr. Cockerell, has the abdominal hair- bands 

 more distinct and regular, and the pubescence of first hind tarsal 

 joint, instead of being entirely dark, is about evenly divided be- 

 tween dark-brown and whitish. 



7. Centris Hoffmaimseggiae Ckll. 



Centris Hoffmannseggke Cockerell, Ibid., 395, rf (non 9 )» 1897. 

 Centris lanosa Cockerell (not Cresson). Ibid., 397, 9 (non ^), 1897. 



New Mexico : Mesilla Valley. To my mind Mr. Cockerell has 

 confused the sexes of Hoffmann seg glee and lanosa, judging from his 

 descriptions. Cotypes of Hoffmannseggke 9 differ at once from 

 the described male in their bare abdomen beyond the first segment, 

 the cJ 1 having the abdomen pubescent on all the segments, especially 

 the two first. Now, the 9 lanosa described by Cockerell, has 

 " the second abdominal segment, as well as the first, delicately 

 pruinose." In the male lanosa the first segment only is pruinose. 



8. Centris Cockerellii n. n. 



Centris Iloffmannseggm Cockerell, Ibid., 395, 9 ( non c?)> 1897. 

 New Mexico: Mesilla Valley. I propose this name for the species 

 described as the female of Hoffmannseggke, which is apparently 

 distinct from the latter. 



9. Centris atriventris n. sp. 



9. — Black; head in front and cheeks with grayish pubescence, 

 that on vertex pale fulvous; clypeus yellow, broader than long, 

 strongly punctured but smooth down middle ; labrum yellow, semi- 

 lunate, strongly punctured, its apex broadly and roundly slightly 

 emarginate ; flagellum testaceous beneath from apex of first joint, 

 the latter distinctly shorter than the four following joints; scape 

 entirely dark ; thorax above with pale fulvous pubescence, that on 

 sides slightly paler, beneath the pubescence is black, or blackish - 

 brown; legs reddish-brown, the pubescence of the anterior ones

fuscous brown, with that on tarsi black ; on the other legs it is 

 black, except on the medial tibiae outwardly, where it is rather 

 similar to that of the fore legs ; abdomen shining black, the first 

 segment anteriorly with pale pubescence ; the apex of first and the 

 second to fourth dorsal segments quite nude; the apex of fifth 

 dorsal fringed with dark hairs; second to fourth ventrals fringed 

 apically and clothed medially with long black hairs; sixth segment 

 with black hairs, the pygidium triangular, with a triangular raised 

 area at base which sends out a carina from its apex which reaches 

 nearly to tip of pygidium; wings subhyaline. Length 12 mm. 



cf. — Similar to ¥ in coloration, but with the mandibles within 

 toward the base, the inner orbits as high as insertion of antennse 

 and a line on scape, yellow ; first joint of flagellum not as long as 

 two following united; labrum semicircular, not emarginate; daik 

 pubescence of ventral surface of thorax not so evident as in the 9 . 

 Length 12 mm. 



Texas. One female and two male specimens. A female speci- 

 men from lower California agrees in coloration with this species, 

 but there is a slight difference in the shape of pygidium. I am 

 not quite certain that it is the same, however, as the first abdominal 

 segment is scarcely pubescent. 



10. Centris lanosa Cress. 



Centris lanosa Cresson, Trans. Am. Ent. Soc. iv. •>!. 

 Centris lanosa Cockerell, 1. c. 397, $ (non I). 1^97. 



Texas; Xew Mexico: Las Cruces. The pale patch at base of 

 hind tibiae externally is characteristic of this species. The pubes- 

 cence of femora varies from brown to pale. 



11. Centris subhyalina n. sp. 



1. — Black, including clypeus and labrum; head in front and 

 on cheeks with grayish pubescence, that on vertex pale fulvous : 

 clypeus strongly punctured, with a raised smooth line down centre, 

 the fore margin narrowly reddish-testaceous; labrum semicircular, 

 strongly punctured, its outer margin narrowly reddish-testaceous; 

 flagellum obscurely testaceous beneath from apex of second joint , the 

 latter a little longer than the following three joints united; scape 

 not pale; thorax with pale fulvous pubescence above extending half 

 way on sides, where it is met by black-brown pubescence which 

 clothes the under surface; pubescence of middle segment and first

segment of abdomen paler; legs dark red, or black, the pubescence 

 of four posteriors entirely black, that of the anteriors brownish; 

 abdomen shining black, the apex of first, and the second to fourth 

 dorsals bare ; fifth dorsal as well as the second to fifth ventrals 

 fringed with black hairs; sixth segment with dark-brown pubes- 

 cence, the pygidium almost as in atriventris ; wings subhyaline. 

 Length 12 mm. 



Texas. Three specimens. This species is apparently quite close 

 to C mexicana Smith, but in that species the wings are described 

 as fuscous. C. subhyalhia may subsequently prove to be the 

 female of C. lanosa Cress.

 space between eye and mandible reddish; eyes slightly diverging 

 above; clypeus medially flattened and impunctate, otherwise 

 strongly punctured ; labrum strongly punctured, covered with long 

 hairs, acuminate apically; second joint of flagellum about as long 

 as the third, fourth, fifth and half of sixth joints united; a small

NEW AND INTERESTING SPECIES IN THE "ISAAC LEA COLLECTION 

 OF EOCENE MOLLUSCA." 



BY CBAS. W. JOHNSON. 



Through the kindness of Rev. L. T. Chamberlain, D. D , Curator 

 of the " Isaac Lea Collection of Eoceue Mollusca" in the Acad- 

 emy of Natural Sciences, I have been permitted to describe the 

 following new species, which have been collected by Mr. Thomas A. 

 Morgan, Mr. Frank Burns and the writer, in Alabama, Mississippi, 

 Louisiana, and Texas, during explorations made under the direc- 

 tion and at the expense of Dr. Chamberlain. 

 Volvaria reticulata n. sp. Plate I, fig. 1. 



Shell cylindrical, spire prominent, whorls five, the three apical 

 whorls smooth, the body and adjoining whorl reticulated by numer- 

 ous, raised, revolving and longitudinal lines, the revolving lines 

 equidistant, while the longitudinal ones, which represent lines of 

 growth, are finer and irregular ; columella with two moderate folds. 

 Length lh mm., greatest diameter 3 mm. 



One specimen collected by the writer, from the Lower Claiborne 

 at Moseley's Ferry, Brazos river, Burleson Co., Texas. 

 Mitra grantensis n. sp. Plate I, fig. 2. 



Shell fusiform, specimen sliQwing eight whorls (apex Avanting), 

 the first whorl below the apex smooth, the two following Avhorls 

 show only the numerous longitudinal ribs, while the remaining 

 whorls have equally prominent revolving ridges, which are 

 somewhat larger on the anterior portion of the body whorl, while 

 the third and fourth ridge below the suture are slightly smaller, 

 the interstices formed by the two series of ridges consists of deep 

 square pits, interior of the outer lip with numerous small ridges, 

 columella with four folds, the anterior one very small. Length 

 14 mm., greatest diam. 5 mm. 



One specimen collected by the writer from the Jacksonian Eocene 

 at Montgomery, Grant Parish, La. 

 Fusus apicalis n. sp. Plate I, fig. 3. 



Shell with ten convex whorls, apical whorl smooth, and the three 




72 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



subapical whorls with numerous fine longitudinal raised lines, but 

 no revolving sculpture, the other six whorls with six large longitu- 

 diual ribs, these are crossed by seven revolving ridges on the spiral 

 whorl and about 22 on the body whorl ; the second and third 

 ridges below the suture somewhat smaller than the others; between 

 the longitudinal ribs and on the narrow anterior portion of the 

 body whorl the revolving ridges become nodulose. Length 31 

 mm., greatest diam. 10 mm. 



Three specimens collected by the writer from the Lower Clai- 

 borne at " Alabama Bluff," Trinity river, Houston Co., Texas. 



This locality, which is fifteen miles southwest of Crockett, is 

 better known as Alabama Crossing. 



Fusus houstonensis n. sp. Plate I, fig. 4. 



Shell showing eight convex whorls, which are somewhat angular 

 toward the apex (apical whorl wanting), whorls with eight promi- 

 nent longitudinal ribs, and eight revolving ridges on the spiral 

 whorls, the body whorl has about 30 revolving ridges, which be- 

 come smaller on the anterior portion, the two peripheral ridges are 

 more prominent, between and above which are small intermediate 

 raised lines, these are obsolete or wanting between the other ridges. 

 Length of the type specimen 44 mm., greatest diam. 14 mm. 



Collected by the writer from the Lower Claiborne at " Alabama 

 Bluff," Trinity river, Houston Co., Texas. 



Fusus ludovicianus n. sp. Plate I, fig. 5. 



Shell with eleven very convex whorls, the two apical whorls 

 smooth, the following whorl with numerous oblique longitudinal

 BY THOMAS MEEHAN. 



i. Sex in flowers. — Corylus rostrata. 



Since the publication of my first paper on the law governing the 

 sexual characters of flowers, 1 and others subsequently ou the same 

 topic, the evidence of the soundness of the principles therein pre- 

 sented is everywhere so palpable that I have for some years past 

 given up noting it and placing it on record. The principle 

 then and subsequently made plain is, that in the earlier stages of 

 its life a flower bud maybe either male or female, and that the final 

 determination of sex is a mere question of nutrition. If there be 

 an abundant supply of nutrition available, or vital power capable 

 of availing itself of the nutrition provided, the female character- 

 istics prevail. With lessened nutrition, or of vital power in the 

 floral matrix to make use of nutrition, the male characteristics 

 result. These views, opposed as they were by eminent biologists, 

 and even ridiculed by my esteemed friend Prof. Agassiz on the 

 reading of my paper, I have lived to note are generally accepted, 

 though at times it seems to me that a few more recorded observa- 

 tions might be profitable. Before me at this time is an able paper 

 by Prof. Kenjiro Fujii, of the Imperial University of Tokyo, 

 Japan, on sexuality in the flowers of Pinus densiflora.' 1 He 

 finds in his observations that the sex of the flowers is undeter- 

 mined until a certain stage of development, and that a flower which 

 would otherwise develop into a male has a tendency to become 

 female when local increase of nourishment takes place at a certain 

 stage, or during certain stages of its development. This seems so 

 like the language of my papers of a quarter of a century ago, that 

 it is pleasant to know that Prof. Fujii has worked the conclusion 

 out in utter iguorance of my having occupied the field before him.

I will give a striking illustration of the soundness of this principle, 

 which I have not hitherto recorded, in Corylus rostrata. 



In one of my earlier papers 3 I recorded that there was a uni- 

 form line of character dividing the species of western Europe from 

 their close allies in eastern America. Among other points, the 

 tendency to lateral branching is more marked in the European 

 than in the American line of the same family. Corylus Arellano, 

 and Corylus rosbrata, which I had not in that list, are good illus- 

 trations. In a cubic yard of growth there would seem to be hun- 

 dreds of twiggy branchlets in Corylus Arellano,, the common Euro- 

 pean Hazelnut, to the scores only in the North American Hazelnut, 

 Corylus rostrata. It is important to note this difference in these 

 species, in connection with these sexual questions, because at first 

 glance the male catkins seem terminal in the European, and axillary 

 in the American. The male catkins seem situated on comparatively 

 strong branchlets; while the female buds seem to be on branchlets 

 often weaker, and situated below the males and more unfavorably 

 located as regards nutrition. That this is deceptive will hereafter 

 be shown. 



The branching of Corylus rostrata is remarkable for its stiff rigid 

 character. It might be taken for some willow at first sight, rather 

 than a relative of Corylus Arellano ; although this latter species has 

 this culm-like or reedy appearance before the plaut reaches its flow- 

 ering stage. The dowers appear along the whole length of these 

 rigid branchless stems. The male flowers are produced from the 

 lower nodes, and the female from the upper ones. But the propor- 

 tion of each on the separate branches is in exact proportion to the 

 vigor of the branches. On a very slender twig of perhaps twelve 

 or fifteen nodes, there will be a male catkin from every bud. On 

 the branches of medium strength the proportion of male to female 

 will be equal, while on the branches of superior vigor all but three 

 or four of the lower ones will be female. On a strong leading 

 shoot before me, and which is characteristic of numbers of others 

 on the plant from which it was taken, the four lower buds only 

 have catkins; while the ten upper buds have either female flowers- 

 or a few strong buds to make branchlets for next season. 



Xo one closely observing a vigorous plant of Corylus rostrata can

 Trees" (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 186?. p. 10). 




86 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



fail to be impressed with the truth of the principle I have ad- 

 vanced, that the question of sex in flowers is merely a question of 

 nutrition in an early stage. 



For reasons already given, the fact is not so apparent in Corylw 

 Avellana. In the later period of the growing season, in this 

 species, some of the axillary buds develop to short branchlets 

 instead of remaining as buds to bear flowers, and make growth for 

 the coming year. It is from the axillary buds of this secondary 

 growth that the male catkins appear, and thus present the appear- 

 ance, from their elevated position, of being superiorly situated as 

 regards nutrition than the female flower buds, which are only 

 apparently below. When closely examined it will readily be seen 

 on how weak the axes and how very unfavorably for nutrition these 

 buds of the male catkins are situated. 



It may be noted that the axial buds, bearing the male flowers in 

 Corylus rodrata, develop slightly to a branchlet in the fall of the 

 year, but I have never seen one to reach more than a quarter of 

 an inch in length. 



I know of no monoecious plant that does not show a more or less 

 continuous activity during the early autumn, or even during the 

 winter season if a few days of springlike weather occur, and the 

 postulate may be presented that a marked characteristic in the 

 growth of a female flower is the greater conservation of energy dur- 

 ing its early stages, as compared with a tendency to reckless expen- 

 diture in the male flowers. After all, this is but another way of 

 expressing what has already been made plain, that the ability to 

 store and to profit by nutrition accounts for sexual differentiation. 



II. ClETHKA ALNIFOLIA IN RELATION TO ITS MORPHOLOGY. 



In families where there is considerable irregularity in the number 

 and arrangement of related plants, it is important in what might be 

 termed genealogical botany that the primary type should be well 

 understood. In Ericacea?, for instance, we have genera with vary- 

 ing numbers in the calyx, corolla, stamens, and styles; some are 

 gamopetalous and some polypetalous, while some have inferior ami 

 others superior ovaries. 



As all parts of a plant from the starting in growth of the seed 

 to the final maturity of the flowers it produces are but modified 

 leaf -blades, the arrangement of the leaf-blades on the primary stem 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 87 



should furnish a good foundation for subsequent investigation. 



Taking a fairly vigorous branch of Clethra alnifolia, we note that 

 the phyllotaxis is on the § plan. "We may, on this fact, look for 

 a pentamerous system to prevail in the subsequent development, 

 and charge to consolidation or to abortion any variation from this 

 type. Following again the Clethra, we find a five- cleft calyx, and 

 we say it is normal. Then we have five petals alternate with the 

 sepals, which again we pronounce normal. But the next cycle 

 appears as ten stamens, which for a single cycle would be out of 

 order. Observing closely, however, we note that five of the ten 

 are longer than the others, and we learn that there are really two 

 cycles of five, of which the long stamens represent the outer. 



Taking up now the gyncecium : the stigma is noted as being 

 slightly three-cleft, indicating a tricarpellary ovarium. There should 

 be five. Two are wanting. This sudden departure from what 

 has hitherto been a regular pentamerous series, suggests that there 

 has been a suppression of several verticils since the appearance of 

 the last staminal whorl. A glandular disk fills the interspace, and 

 we may reasonably conclude that herein lie the missing links. The 

 carpel lary system here is parallel to prolificacy as often seen in 

 flowers. One rose proceeds from the centre of another rose, or a 

 small orange at the apex of a larger one, as in the variety known 

 as the navel. The upper one, as in the case of the gyncecium of 

 Clethra, loses much of the normal vitality of the individual. 



In some genera of Ericacea? cohesion — vital power in its higher 

 stage — plays a part in organizing, the reverse of the lower degree, 

 but still with the same result in the disappearance of parts that 

 me may term primarily separate. In examining a large number of 

 Clethra flowers, a pair of stamens will occasionally be found as 

 completely consolidated into a single filament as the carpels have 

 had the three styles united; the extreme upper portions of each, 

 however, continuing normal. It shows a tendency to consolidation. 

 From a consideration of all the facts, we may conclude that the 

 primary type of Ericaceae is pentamerous and polypetalous, that 

 those approaching this type are the oldest in the genealogical line, 

 and that all the variations from this type in the order are deducti- 

 ble from the variations in growth-energy resulting in the abortion 

 or consolidation of primary parts.

in. Sank iLA — a biological study. 



Examining a plant of Sanicula llarilandica, a striking point 

 presents itself in its branching character. These branchlets are 

 usually in threes, and exceptionally in fours. That acute observer, 

 Rafinesque, noticed this, and it was doubtless on account of this 

 striking character that he proposed the name of Trieliniuni, when 

 he thought to make a new genus out of the older Sanicula. 



I have endeavored to teach in numerous papers, that by far tuo 

 much is claimed for environment in the evolution of form. It 

 would rather seem that form depends on a purely mathematical law 

 of growth-force. Growth is not a continuous operation, but rhyth- 

 mic. The degree of force depends on a supply of nutrition and 

 the ability of the plant cell to avail itself of the supply. As, 

 therefore, each rhythmic wave varies in intensity, the ultimate form 

 of the immediate structure under the influence of that wave must 

 vary accordingly. 



Again I have taught that even sex is influenced by like condi- 

 tions. Those parts of the flower or portions of a plant under the 

 influence of a vigorous growth-wave laden with nutrition favor 

 the production of female organs — the feeble wave is productive of 

 male organs only. 



A study of Sanicula well illustrates these points. The first 

 growth-wave ceases at the first pair of leaves. This must have 

 been very sudden ; for the main axis has been so deprived of food, 

 and its vital power rendered so weak, that it can only make a feeble 

 growth with the advance of the next wave. The consequence is 

 that the growth-wave is turned into the two axillary buds. They 

 take the place of the original axis, and we have two leading 

 branches instead of one. The original axis remains a weak, 

 threadlike, common pedicel, which bears usually but a single fertile 

 flower and numerous barren ones. In some species of plants the 

 central axis utterly fails under the shock of the rhythmic growth. 

 In that case we have the dichotomous mode of branching. 



Passing the eye along the stem, we find the growth-wave, rhyth- 

 mic as it is, decreasing in vigor. The central axis profits more 

 by nutrition — the branches from the axial buds are less like leaders 

 — and by the time the terminal point is reached we find it sur- 

 mounted by a fruit on a pedicel much stronger than the lateral ones. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 89 



There are but three lateral branchlets, though occasionally four; 

 and the retarding of the axial growth has been of such a severe 

 character, that the axillary origin of the lateral branches has been 

 totally obscured. The pedicillate male flowers originate from 

 numerous axillary buds on these fruit-bearing branchlets, the 

 external evidence of such origin being also obscured. It is be- 

 lieved that a careful study as indicated will be convincing that it i> 

 the degree of the rhythmic growth-force that decides the character 

 of the plant, and also the relation of the sexes to each other. 



Now let us take Sanicula Canadensis. "With the light already 

 gained, we see that nothing but a variation in the force of the rhyth- 

 mic wave has made a distinct species. The characters are all of the 

 same class, but there has been acceleration and retardation of the 

 wave force in different directions. The axillary branchlets have 

 continued to retain the attention of the growth-wave to the last, 

 and now bear the female flowers — while the weaker central one has 

 accorded to it male ones only. Examining, now, the Old "World 

 species, Sanicula Europcea, we see scarcely any difference except 

 such as might occur from variation in the degree and direction of 

 the growth-wave. Nutrition has been diverted from the central 

 axis to a greater degree than even in our own S. Canadensis. It 

 produces only short-stalked male flowers. 



We here have a genus in which we can clearly see how the 

 species were made. The degree of force exerted by the rhythmic 

 wave started the process, and the assimilation of nutrition completed 

 the task. 



The study brings us nearer to a perception of the origin of 

 species. But we may not yet perceive the hand that set the process 

 in motion. The characters that distinguish these three species seem 

 permanent now. They do not change under any conditions of 

 environment existing at the present time, however varied they may 

 be. Though we may say that the three species would easily be 

 produced out of one type, simply by varying degrees of growth- 

 force; the conditions under which this variation occurred, and the 

 period in the world's history when they occurred and became 

 hereditary, is still a mystery.

iv. Rosa rugosa in connection with the evolution 



OF FORM. 



A few years ago I crossed a flower of Rosa rugosa with pollen 

 from the well-known hybrid perpetual, General Jacqueminot. It 

 may be noted here that in this locality the rose anthers mature 

 almost simultaneously with the expansion of the petals. To be 

 certain that a flower will have no aid from its own pollen, my prac- 

 tice is to open the petals carefully the day before they would expand 

 naturally, remove the stamens with the unopened anthers, and then 

 at once apply the foreign pollen. Though I believe pollen will 

 remain potent at the apex of a stigma for an indefinite time, so as 

 to be ready to perform its function the moment the stigma becomes 

 receptive, I apply more pollen after the petals open normally. 

 With these precautions I feel safe in my experiments against the 

 interference of undesirable pollen. These precautions were taken 

 in this experiment with Rosa rugosa. 



In the autumn the seeds were cleaned from the capsule and sown 

 in the open ground. 



The following summer two plants only had made their appear- 

 ance, and attracted attention at once from the fact that one of them 

 had the appearance in foliage and habit of General Jacqueminot, 

 and the other somewhat after the manner of Rosa rugosa, the 

 female parent. The first year of seedling roses results in compar- 

 atively feeble growth. The stronger growth of the second year 

 was eagerly looked forward to. When that time arrived the one 

 resembling the male parent was stricken with a fungous parasite, 

 and so severely that, in spite of our efforts with copper solutions, 

 the branches were no stronger than they were the year before. 

 The vital power was so much reduced that it was totally destroyed 

 by the subsequent winter. In spite of its weakened condition, it 

 retained to the last its striking resemblance to the hybrid perpetuals 

 of which General Jacqueminot is a type. The other flowered, and 

 to my great surprise was not Rosa rugosa, but a perfectly typical 

 specimen of Rosa cinnamomea ! It is still flowering at this date, 

 June, 1897, and is simply the cinnamon rose. 



To carry this curious experiment further, I had a small quantity 

 of seed of Rosa cinnamomea and Rosa rugosa sown near to each 

 other where comparisons could be made as they grew. There were 

 something less than a hundred plants in each lot. Both sets were 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. !>1 



nearly identical in character as they grew. The branches were 

 slender, smooth, with scattered spines, and no acicula?. As the 

 plants gained vigor, strong branches, densely clothed with bristles, 

 would appear from the rugosa plants, and ultimately became abso- 

 lutely that species. Some of them would, however, continue to 

 produce some smooth slender branches; and these, flowering, were 

 purely Rosa cinnamomea — the two species flowering on the same 

 plant, These separate blocks of roses are still blooming where 

 they were sown, and in the bed of Rosa rugosa there are ten plants 

 that still continue Rosu cinnamomea. 



The bed of Rosa cinnamomea continued its comparatively weak 

 growth characteristic of the species. Occasionally a strong shoot 

 would push out from near the ground covered with bristles as in 

 R. rugosa; but it would eventually weaken, become smooth, and 

 have the smaller flowers, foliage, and, in fact, be nothing but /'. 

 ■cinnamomea. One only assumed a more vigorous and bristly 

 character. This plant has the flowers as large as those of R. 

 rugosa — that is to say, they are more than double the size of the 

 normal cinuamon rose, though continuing the pale rose eolor 

 instead of the deep crimson of R. rugosa. The foliage also. 

 though not as coarsely wrinkled, that is to say, rugose, as the 

 other, still is diverse from the type, and is an advance in the 

 direction of the latter rose. 



Two remarkable facts are made clear by these observations: 



First. — Two totally distinct forms can be produced from the 

 same seed vessel, though every condition surrounding their incep- 

 tion seems exactly the same. 



Second. — Rosa rugosa, a species with characters markedly distinct 

 from Rosa cinnamomea, is nevertheless an evolution from that 

 species, and has been produced by the energy of a more vigorous 

 development. 



"We may conclude from these facts that however much may be 

 conceded to gradual modifications extending over indefinite periods 

 as an agency in the evolution of species, development need not be 

 dependent on this principle alone. The varying degrees of inter- 

 nal energy must be credited with producing sudden and remarkable 

 changes, though we may not yet be able to perceive clearly the 

 nature of the motive power that induces it.

V. VIOLA IX RELATION TO POLLINIZATION AND FECUNDATION. 



Though it has beeu shown by many close observers that the 

 general opinion is erroneous that early or perfect flowers of many 

 species of Viola are infertile, the impression is still widely preva- 

 lent, especially in the case of the very common Vio/a cucullata. I 

 have myself held that opinion, though I have placed on record that 

 they were abundantly fertile when growing on a dry rocky piece of 

 ground. I had, however, never made the continuous daily obser- 

 vations on them that I have made on other plants, and so made it 

 a point to do so, commencing the task on the first of April, 1897. 



I have an orchard of about half an acre, partially shaded by 

 the branches of the apple trees meeting together. The surface was 

 originally in grass, but at the date given only a few tufts remained. 

 The whole at the date named was a sheet of violets in bloom. 

 These many thousands of plants all sprung from a few. I noticed 

 these a quarter of a century ago. Myriads of seeds from last 

 year's crop were showing cotyledons. By sheer force of numbers 

 they were crowding out all other vegetation, and it is a question 

 whether their operations had not as much to do with the destruction 

 of the original grass as the shade which the apple trees afforded. 



Though from a few original plants, the assemblage at this date 

 presented a remarkable variation in the form and color of the flow- 

 ers. Some had petals almost linear, others petals almost round. 

 In some cases the two upper petals would be nearly round, and the 

 three lower ones very narrow. The color of the petals varied in 

 innumerable shades, from the normal violet to nearly white in one 

 direction, and to nearly red in the other. Some plants would have 

 the peduncles little longer than the leaves ; others would have the 

 flowers on long and slender peduncles. A notable fact, however, 

 was, that with all this variation in the flowers, not a trace of varia- 

 tion could be found in the plants themselves. In foliage and 

 habit, every plant seemed an exact repetition of another one. As- 

 conditions of environment could have nothing to do with these 

 variations, and as there were no varieties to aid variation through 

 cross pollination, there can be but one deduction, that internal 

 energy alone is responsible for the changes. 



My next thought was to watch for insect visitors. Winged 

 insects are scarce with us in April. I saw none among these plants 




1899. J NATURAL -i IENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 93 



•dui'ing the -whole mouth. I cannot say that these millions of violet 

 flowers had no insect visitors during that period, but it is safe to 

 say that if auy were visited by insects the number would be so 

 inconsiderable as to have no influence on the result. 



Numberless flowers were opened from day to day. All the 

 anther-sacs were abundantly supplied with perfect pollen. From 

 the earliest period the upper portion of the style, with its stigma, 

 would be in advance of the stamens. When the pollen would be 

 projected from the anther-cells, the membranous appendages of the 

 anthers would be so closely appressed to the style that it would be 

 very difficult for pollen to get through to reach the stigma. 

 Though pollen grains could get through this close-fitting sheath, the 

 3tigma is so thoroughly encased by the mass of hair in the throat, 

 that it is inconceivable that pollen should ever reach it. As a 

 matter of fact, I could never find a grain of pollen on the portion 

 of the style above the membranous sheath, and of course none in 

 the stigma, though the ovarium clasped by the anthers themselves 

 would be completely pollen-dusted. 



I was satisfied from these observations that the flowers could 

 not prove fertile, and was prepared to believe that so far as Viola 

 cucullata is concerned, the popular impression regarding infertilty 

 in this species was correct. I started to examine several other 

 species in the same relations. Viola tricolor is conceded to have its 

 early perfect flowers fertile. I examined some flowers from the 

 wild species mowing in my garden. I found the stigma barely 

 extending beyond the membrane sheath, which, by the way, was not 

 closely clasping, nor was there a mass of hair on the petals to 

 guard the receptive portion from an attack by the pollen grains. 

 It did seem that the fecundity of the early flowers could be ac- 

 counted for. But again I could not find a single pollen grain on 

 the apex of the style, or stigma, as we would terminologically say ! 



By the time the first week in May was reached, I was surprised 

 to find an abundant crop of seed vessels on the earlier flowers in 

 the orchard, the peduucles curving toward the ground just as they 

 ■do in the cleistogamic condition. A number, probably one-third., 

 had failed to perfect seed, but they had advanced considerably 

 before withering, showing that their early demise was not from 

 non-pollination, but from a failure of nutrition, just as in many 

 fruit trees we find the 2-rouud beneath their branches strewed with 




94 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [l^i*.. 



immature fruit, which has fallen, after being fairly fertilized, by 

 the failure in the stock of nutrition to bring them to perfection. lu 

 the carefully noted observations of Mr. Darwin and others in the 

 Old World, on the fertilization of flowers, failure of nutrition is- 

 rarely permitted to account for the failures to seed in many of the 

 experiments noted. 



I have for some time past concluded that, in some manner not 

 yet demonstrated, pollen tubes may and do at times reach the 

 ovules otherwise than by way of what we commonly know as the 

 receptive portions of the stigma. In Viola tricolor this may occur 

 by way of the filmy hair on the dorsal part of the stigma, which 

 the pollen may reach in this species as already noted, and the ques- 

 tion may arise as to what is the stigma proper in Viola. It is 

 customary to regard the small opening at the apex of the thickened 

 style as the stigma. I am inclined to regard it rather as a necta- 

 riferous gland. In examining flowers of Viola cueullata, just 

 before they expand, the orifice of this tube is closed. When 

 the flower is examined the day following the opening, a globule of 

 very sweet nectar occupies the position; the following day this 

 disappears, and the hollow cavity noticed by various authors is 

 evident under a good lens. This open passage is hardly consistent 

 with the general character of a passage way for a pollen tube 

 which has to depend for material in building up its structure on the 

 cellular matter which it meets with on its journey to the ovule. 

 Nor can I recall any instance in which such a large proportion of 

 nectar is secreted by the receptive point of a stigma. On the other 

 hand, if we believe, as we undoubtedly may, that nectariferous 

 glands are atrophied primary structures, it will be difficult to trace 

 the morphology of such a gland situated in the position this occu- 

 pies. 



But the morphology of the violet presents some anomalies. 

 Though it is certain, as I have demonstrated in various papers, that 

 the leaf does not always originate from the node from which it 

 seems to spring, and that it is the union of the edges of the leaf-blade 

 that causes what we know as decurrence in stem structure — it does 

 not follow that decurrence is not sometimes really cte-currence. In 

 many species of Lactuca from the south of Europe and eastern 

 Asia, this is evidently so ; and in Viola the auricles at the base of 

 the sepals would undoubtedly have to be accounted for in any fair 




1*99.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 95 



conception of the consolidated part? of the flower. I take it we 

 are to look in this direction for the origin of the spur in the petals 

 of the violet, and in the fleshy appendages to the stamens, some- 

 times called nectariferous glands, which fill the spur spaces. Mr. 

 Darwin observes that he once saw Bombus terrestris slit the spur of 

 Viol<i eanina in search of the nectar these glands secrete, and it is 

 generally supposed they are nectariferous. But certainly in Viola 

 cueullata they excrete nothing, as I infer, from not having been 

 sufficiently differentiated from their primary condition to be perfect 

 glands. Taking now, as we may again, the consolidated style, as 

 not merely the elongated extension of the carpels, but also of the 

 primary axis as well; and the thickened upper portion of the style 

 ;i- a feeble effort to form another verticil of floral organs, the apex 

 of the primary shoot would be extremely likely to end in a com- 

 plete gland. If this view be correct, we have to look elsewhere for 

 the passageway to the ovules; unless indeed we conclude that it is 

 possible for nectariferous glands to serve as ducts for pollen tubes 

 in some instances, a circumstance I have sometimes suspected. 



VI. IsXARDIA PALCSTRIS ADDITIONAL NOTE ON ITS 



STIPU LA R G LA N DS. " 



I noted in 1886 that the usual description of Onagracea? — leaves 

 without stipules — was not strictly correct, as they were present in 

 the form of glands in Isnardia I Ludvngia) palustris, the marsh 

 purslane. Dr. Asa Gray, to whose regular and friendly correspon- 

 dence through a number of years I am greatly indebted, wrote: 

 " You have certainly found something; but whether these glands 

 should be considered stipular or not, I am not prepared to say." 

 The matter had passed from my mind till recently, when the oppor- 

 tunity occurred to spend several hours in the midst of a large 

 quantity of the plant. 



At the base of the solitary axillary flower is a pair of minute 

 scales. The general resemblance of the gland and its connection 

 with the base of the petiole suggested the possibility that these 

 "•lands might also be bracts or scales that had come within the 

 connate power so potent in this species. This power is well exem- 

 plified in the structure of the flower. The stamens are opposite the 

 sepals, indicating that the petals have disappeared. Then we note 



4 Pron. Acad. Xat. Sci., 1886, p. 349. 




Ii; PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



that where there should have beeu petals alternate with the sepals 

 and stamens, there are four greenish umbonate glands. These of 

 themselves suggest abortive petals. Holding the flowers up to the 

 light, however, we find by the aid of the lens that the petals are 

 really there, but have been completely covered by the connate 

 sepals, the glands being the thickened apices ! May not the sup- 

 posed stipular gland, in like manner, be some foliar organ almost 

 covered by the union of superior parts ? In aid, farther, of this 

 suggestion, we note that the primary origin of the leaf is far below 

 the point from which the leaf proper or blade seems to spring. 

 The consolidated petiole can be traced far below the base of the 

 expanded portion. Each consolidated petiole, however, grasps only 

 one-fourth of the circumference of the stem, thus giving it a sub- 

 quadrangular character. Why might not the supposed stipule be 

 the apex of another pair of minute scaly bracts, all of which but 

 the extreme points had been covered, as the petals were, by the 

 superior size of the consolidating parts above ? With these sug- 

 gestions we examine the stipular glands closely, only to find that 

 they are opposite to, and not alternate with, the pair of scaly 

 bracts above them. AVe must still believe they are stipular appen- 

 dages of the leaves, and not the upper remains of independent but 

 sul nnerged organs. 



Of late years it has been found that what appear as striking 

 exceptions to general rule can be accounted for in the regular 

 way, the operation of the law only having been obscured. Why 

 Imardia should yet seem a striking exception to the absence of 

 stipules in Onagrads still remains a problem. 



During the examination of these plants the absolute fertility of 

 the flowers was suggestive of perfect self-fertilization. Few axils 

 but had their primary branching system retarded for the production 

 of a flower instead. Not a solitary imperfect seed-vessel could 

 be found, out of the many hundreds on a single branching plant. 

 Self-fertilization was found to be the fact. ISot only do the anthers 

 discharge the pollen simultaneously with the expansion of the 

 sepals; but they rest on the stigma, so that it is impossible for any 

 external agency to interfere with their work. 



Another interesting observation is that at the expansion of the 

 sepals, nectar copiously exudes from the umbones above noted. Is"o 

 winged insect appears to visit these minute flowers. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 97 



It would .seem from these observations that the gland in Imardia 

 palustris is really stipular; that the petals are not abortive, but 

 have been covered by the connation of the sepals ; that the flowers 

 are arranged so that self-fertilization must ensue ; that these self- 

 fertilized flowers are enormously productive ; and that the produc- 

 tion of nectar, so far as the visits of insects may be concerned, is 

 superfluous. 



vii. Parthenogenesis. 



It is about two hundred years ago since Camerarius recorded 

 the fact that female mulberries and other trees would produce fruit 

 without pollinization, though such fruit was sterile. These obser- 

 vations have since been abundantly confirmed. The necessity of 

 pollen to fertile seed came to be regarded as absolute law, until 

 some fifty years ago, when the Curator at Kew, Mr. John Smith, an- 

 nounced that an Australian plant, of which he had but one female 

 specimen, perfected its seeds. It proved to be a new Euphorbiacese, 

 and he named it Calebogyne ilicifolia — the generic name from its 

 supposed parthenogenetal character. 



The author of this paper was a student in Kew at that time, and 

 well remembers the incredulity with which the announcement was 

 received, that nature should seem to make a universal law in rela- 

 tion to method of reproduction, and yet make a striking exception 

 in this case. Nature furnishes infinite variation, but these varia- 

 tions seem to be only of one general plan. It seemed more prob- 

 able that, in some method unexplained, pollen had "been formed, 

 and really pollinated the embryo. It does not appear that any 

 further observations on this nlant were made at Kew, or, if made, 

 recorded. 



Strasburger took up the subject again in 1878, but though my 

 good friend, Mr. George Nicholson, Curator of Kew, writes under 

 date of April 10, 1897, that " the whole business has been 

 threshed out by Strasburger," the latter seems to be more concerned 

 about the cell development than the manner of its fertilization. 

 This is especially true of that part devoted to the Castor-oil plant, 

 Ricinus communis. In Ccelebogyne, he insists that the true embryo 

 does not develop, but that the seeds proceed from adventitious 

 buds from the wall of the ovary. One may conceive of them as 

 bulblets, analogous to what we find in viviparous flowers; but he 

 7 




98 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



does not explain how cotyledonous seeds are constructed in this 

 way. 



In 1894 the author of this paper decided to make for himself 

 careful observations on Rieinus. A number of plants were set out 

 in a mass where he could easily watch them. Every male bud that 

 could be observed was rubbed away before expansion. For all this 

 an abundance of seed matured. It was found subsequently that 

 there were other plants within a quarter of a mile. It was thought 

 best to repeat the observations another year. The following year 

 no plants were near but those under observation, and it began to 

 look as if the plants had no use for pollen. Still there seemed 

 doubt, and the observations were continued yearly to the end of 

 1897 — all with the same result. Dr. Ida A. Keller, Professor of 

 Biology in the Philadelphia Girls' High School, an experienced 

 microscopist, aided me considerably in the observations made, and 

 only for the fact that in one of her acute examinations she discov- 

 ered a pollen tube at work on the ovarium, there would have 

 seemed no room for doubt that pollen was unnecessary for the pro- 

 duction of perfect seed in Ricinu*. It was determined to try once 

 more. The past year, 1898, only one plant was allowed to grow, 

 and only one flower spike permitted to remain. All the others 

 were cut away in the bud. This permitted closer examination, 

 which was made almost daily. I noted for the first time that there 

 were on the pedicels with the female flowers, buds scarcely larger' 

 than pin heads, and, under a strong lens, evidently antheriferous. 

 These were carefully cut away. As the female flowers opened 

 they all withered, unlike their fertility in former years. There 

 seemed no doubt that pollen was essential. After half the spike had 

 fallen away, the upper portion, say some twenty flowers, showed 

 ii disposition to permanence. The pretty fringed pistils protruded 

 and continued perfect for many days. Finally, the capsules en- 

 larged until they had about reached the usual dimensions. Now it 

 seemed as if the plant would produce seed without the aid of 

 pollen. After turning brown aud seemingly ripe they were found 

 to be as empty as Camerarius' mulberries were. 



While under the impression during the earlier years of these 

 observations that Ricinus was fruiting in the absence of pollen, I 

 was encouraged by observations seemingly confirmatory by Judge 

 Day, of Buffalo, and Prof. Greene, of Washington, on other 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 99 



plants. At the .same time I had noticed that solitary female plants 

 of Gingko biloba were fruiting abundantly in Germantown, while the 

 only known male plant was at Woodlands, some ten miles away. 

 Recently Japan botanists have discovered spiral coils of sperma- 

 tozoids in the generative cells of Gingko, and others have observed 

 them in Oycas revolutd. 



The conclusion reached by the author is that though for several 

 years he regarded the Castor-oil plant, Ricinus communis, as a gen- 

 uine case of parthenogenesis, the past year's experience still leaves 

 the matter open to doubt. If it be true that the female flowers of 

 Cycas revoluta can generate spermatozoids in their ovaries, and 

 thus self-fertilize the ova, the occurrence must be rare. In this 

 vicinity old specimens of this plant are frequently seed bearing, 

 apparently, but in every case examined by the author they were 

 found to have only empty capsules. 



It seems to the author that the subject of parthenogenesis is by 

 no means thoroughly " thrashed out," and the object of this paper 

 is to encourage continued observations. 



VIII. LACTUCA ScaRIOLA, in relation to variation and 



THE VERTICAL POSITION* OF ITS LEAVES. 



Lactuca Scariola is spreading rapidly over the United States. 

 Some twenty years ago I was led to my first acquaintance with it 

 through the kindness of Dr. George Engehnann. It was then 

 growing in the vicinity of St. Louis. It interested us from the 

 fact that we thought we saw polarity in the leaves. The plane of 

 the leaf was vertical, and it seemed that the edges were directed 

 due north and south. The plants were growing tluckly together, 

 and in the cases which did not come under this rule we concluded 

 that the crowding interfered with the natural tendency. Three 

 years ago, 1894, a solitary plant appeared in my garden. The 

 behavior of a species is always instructive when we can watch its 

 distribution and development from a single plant within a limited 

 area. Being an annual, and flowering after the garden weeding 

 has been completed, it is a comparatively harmless weed. I allowed 

 the plant to seed, and the seeds to be distributed by the wind. 

 The next season a number of plants were allowed to seed. This 

 year, 1897, there are hundreds of plants growing within an area of 

 twenty acres. Many of these I am leaving to grow till they reach 

 the flowering stage, when they will be destroyed.

The variations from the one original plant, and all under the 

 same conditions of environment, are very remarkable. In some 

 the leaves are about four inches long by three wide ; that is to say, 

 broadly ovate, while there are some with leaves nine inches long, 

 and from one to two inches wide. In these plants the long linear 

 leaves are obtuse. In others the leaves are some nine inches long, 

 but widest in the middle — these are sharply acute. The leaves are 

 usually entire, but there are a number that are lyrately pinnatifid. 

 In one case the lobing is so deep that the divisions are little more 

 than narrowly winged nerves. In most cases the leaves are flat at 

 the margins, but in a number of cases they are strongly undulate. 

 One of the most striking variations is in the habit of the plant. 

 In the majority of cases the main stem is less than half an inch 

 thick at the base, and grows up rapidly with wide internodes; in 

 others, the stem will be nearly an inch thick, with little disposition 

 to elongate ; the lateral buds develop to branchlets, and the plant 

 becomes densely bushy, with scarcely any internodes. In these 

 cases the leaves are cuneate at the base. The only characters that 

 seem uniform through this extensive range of variation is the 

 glaucous green of the foliage, the vertical twist to the leaves, and 

 the ridge of bristles along the midrib on its under surface. Surely 

 we may conclude that the variations presented in this case are due 

 to the degree and direction of life energv, and that the common 

 phrases of "cultivation" and "conditions, of environment" 

 have no meaning here. 



The vertical plane of the leaves next commands attention. A 

 careful examination of a number of isolated plants soon leads to 

 the conclusion that there is no polarity — as it is generally ex- 

 pressed. The plane of the leaf is in any direction. There are 

 no more in a northward than in a westward line. I am at a 

 loss to imagine how I, in common with other observers, ever 

 believed it could 'be classed as a " compass plant," unless it be on 

 the general principle that it is easy to see what we are looking for. 



In the examination a novel point presented itself. The leaves 

 are vertical instead of horizontal by reason of a twist just above 

 the point of divergence from the stem. But on every plant there 

 are cases of twists in opposite directions. In former " contribu- 

 tions " I have shown that antidromy is common. There could not 

 be secund inflorescence without it. Two or three leaves in this 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 101 



Laduca following regularly the .spiral against the sun would have 

 the leaves back to back, when the next would twist in the opposite 

 direction so as to face the lower leaf. The occasional pairs of 

 leaves, drawn together in parallel lines, present a very novel and 

 interesting appearance. These cases of antidromy follow no numer- 

 ical rule. The most striking cases of parallelism will naturally 

 be those where two successive leaves in the spiral face each other ; 

 but generally it is the next in the series, or, in some cases, the 

 third or fourth leaf that turns its back on what seems to be the 

 normal spiral course. 



It may be here noted that the numerical order in the phyllotaxis 

 is not as definite as it is supposed to be, and this fact will have 

 some bearing on the phenomena connected with Laduca Scariola. 

 In many plants which have a normal § arrangement, J cases are 

 not infrequently on the same stem. This may be well observed in 

 the thick- stemmed Centaureas. 5 The upper portion of the stem 

 thickens from a considerable distance below the flower, and the 

 numerical arrangement changes according to the degree of thicken- 

 ing. The truth is, as laid down already in these contributions, 

 the cortical layer in a growing branch is made up of the thickened 

 bases of leaves, and the elongated growth of a branch is not in a 

 straight line, but is simply the uncoiling of a growing mass of leaf 

 stalks, the terminals of which become free or proper leaves, as we 

 commonly understand them. That this is the real truth can readily 

 be perceived in many of the stronger growing Compositae. In a 

 Centtnire" macrocephala, now before me, the stem can be readily 

 perceived to be formed in this manner. The lower baf in the 

 spiral laps over the one next above it like a slate or shingle on a 

 roof, and it is the width in proportion to the length of the spiral 

 coil that decides the numerical order in the phyllotaxis. The accel- 

 eration or arrestation of the uncoiling energy will therefore easily 

 explain for us these apparent aberrations from the normal condi- 

 tion. In some plants the energy born of the spiral motion does 

 not cease with the unfolding of the membranous or leaf-blade 

 portion of the structure. In many composites 6 there may be two 

 ■or even three twists to the leaf-blade, giving it a singularly curled- 

 up character.

 S '.cio Dor ia and Gentaurea macrocephala, for illustration. 




102 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



With these facts in mind the occasional facing of each other in 

 leaves of Lactuca Scariola and other plants becomes explainable 

 under the varying degree of energy expended in the uncoilings of 

 the spiral at different times and localities in the growth of the 

 parts. 



An interesting fact in connection with inheritance presented itself 

 in this investigation. As already noted, the plants from the 

 solitary individual varied in numberless ways. The second year's 

 crop had in the main the characters of the parent ; but there were 

 groups here and there which, while varying among themselves, 

 would have the general characteristics of the first variation. For 

 instance, there would be a group of pinnatifid-leaved plants, though 

 with variations in breadth and length, in the divisions of the lobes, 

 and in other respects differing among themselves ; while in other 

 spots would be groups with leaves wholly entire, and other groups 

 with serratures. The seeds from some single plant, reaching the 

 ground together in one place, probably accounted for this. It is at 

 any rate a good illustration of inheritance going along in parallel 

 lines with variation. 



ix. The stigma of Asclepias. 



While preparing the chapter on Asclepias tuberosa for my illus- 

 trations of the Flowers and Ferns of the United States, continued 

 as Meehans Monthly, I noted glandular callosities, not hitherto 

 recorded as being observed, indicating abortive floral organs. It 

 led me to a review of our former beliefs in regard to the structure 

 of these curious flowers. The first morphological difficulty was the 

 supposed five-lobed stigma. With our modern knowledge of 

 morphology it seemed incredible that a flower formed on a quinary 

 plan, losing finally by abortion three or four of its carpels when 

 forming the fruit, should yet have a five-lobed stigma at the apex 

 of its ovarium. A careful examination satisfies me that the 

 accepted view is wrong. The mass forming the supposed stigma is 

 wholly independent of the carpellary system. Indeed, there is no 

 departure from the morphological laws prevailing in flowers gen- 

 erally. Keeping in mind the power of union and segregation, 

 and of arrest and retardation in the development of floral organs, 

 the structure of the flower in Asclepias will be found exceedingly 

 simple. There is no occasion for the mystery brought in generally 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 103 



to account for a seeming departure in regular law, when account- 

 ing for its singular structure. 



In tracing the morphological relationship of the parts of a flower, 

 we are largely aided by examining a number of species. In this 

 study of Asclepias tuberosa, A. verticillata, A. Syriaca and A. 

 incarnata also took part. 



From some vigorous shoots of Asclepias incarnata, the lower 

 leaves showed that normally the leaves are alternate, and arranged 

 on a § plan. "Whatever variation from this plan follows, must 

 be referred to some discordant occurrences. In A. incarnata, 

 we see how this operates in forming the branching character. The 

 main stem is subtended, when it begins to branch, by a weak 

 branchlet on one side and by a leaf without an axillary bud on the 

 other. The exact fact is that what now appears the central axis 

 or leading stem was the axillary bud ! When the rhythmic growth- 

 wave resumed activity the chief energy was directed toward the 

 axillary bud. It pushed aside the former leader, and reduced it to 

 a mere branchlet. "We can still trace this disturbing force through 

 many nodes, though with continued arrestatious and developments 

 it is often difficult to trace the originals eventually. But Ave leam 

 by this to look for these aberrations of the various parts when con- 

 sidering A. tuberosa by itself. In the case of the latter species we 

 find in the earlier states of growth the axillary bud is not able to 

 dislodge the central shoot from leadership. In this case we have 

 the branchlet in the axil of the leaf, and not opposite, as in the 

 other species cited. Later on we may find the growth-energy 

 directed strongly in the axillary direction. But we have learned 

 the valuable lesson that variation in the period of rhythmic 

 growth-energy is sufficient to produce specific characters. 



With the ideal quinary plan in mind we find in Asclepias tuberosa 

 five sepals, and the series of five petal- is alternate with the sepals 

 as such a series should be. Then we have, alternate with these, a 

 series of five stamens, but the filaments have become united up 

 to the connective (represented by a minute dorsal gland), what 

 should have been anthers are petaloid, and we have to call that a. 

 nectary which should have been a more elaborate organ. The five 

 perfect stamens next appear, and properly alternate with the five 

 petaloid stamens (nectaries) below. Now we perceive what, if 

 noted before, has not been recorded : five greenish scales, alternate 




104 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



with the filaments and connate with them, extending beyond the 

 so-called stigmatic disc, and forming a crested covering for the disc 

 at the same time. This series united with the lower portion of the 

 filaments is also connate with the disc. These scales have formed 

 so complete a union with the anthers, as to give the appearance of 

 wings to these organs, but the tracing beyond the apex of the 

 anther clearly indicates their original distinction. Coming now to 

 the disc, we fiud that its lobes are alternate with the scales, and 

 that they are opposite to the anthers. Terming all the various 

 •cycles of a flower independently of the carpellary or axial system, 

 staminal or petaliferous whorls, the substance of the disc may 

 reasonably be referred to a whorl of this character which has had 

 its terminals bent over as the next outer whorl did, and unite 

 io form a homogeneous succulent mass. 



This is more than a conception. The alternate development of 

 each cycle, just as we should expect them to be, brings the facts 

 close to a demonstration. But an examination of the carpellary 

 development makes the facts clearer. Taking a flower about to 

 fade, remove the nectaries, make a vertical section just above the 

 line of the petals, and then open the flower carefully, we find two 

 separate and distinct styles imbedded into the succulent base of the 

 disc. Though seemingly homogeneal with the disc mass, we can 

 with care note that they really terminate at this point. Not only 

 this, but we may see the stigmatic points. As the flower dries, the 

 disc mass separates from the apex of the carpels, and falls with 

 what we may surely call the next corollary system. In Asclepias 

 JSyriaea, the union of the real stigma with the supposed stigmatic 

 disc has been so slight, that no sign of a cicatrice remains to mark 

 the earlier connection. 



The union of parts that we conceive to be normally separate is 

 so characteristic of Asclepias, that we see the evidence in many 

 ways. The breaking up of the quinary method in this way has 

 already been noted. In Asclepias tuberosa this is further seen at 

 the base of each umbel. Each flower, normally, is a primary 

 branch, with the subtending leaf in the axil from which it sprang. 

 But the bases of the flower branches with the subtending bracts 

 have become united and succulent, with only here and there the 

 point of a bract like the topmast of a sunken ship appearing just 

 above the surface. 




L899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 105 



"We may now conclude that there is no special mystery to he 

 solved in the flower of Asclepias. The structure is very simple. 

 The parts, as we conceive them primarily to he, are all there, 

 and in their regular places. The tendency to arrestation and union 

 accounts for what seems strange. 



With the elucidation of the real structure of the flower, other 

 mysteries will dissolve. No one has heen able to explain the 

 manner in which the flower is pollinized. The accepted hypothesis 

 is the chance transference of a pollen mass to the disc by means of 

 an insect's foot. The abundance and regularity of seed vessels 

 on many species should at once discredit such a notion. Regularity 

 does not follow accident. In almost every umbel in' Asclepias 

 incamata, there are regularly one or two fertile flowers, and this is 

 true of other species. As the anther cells rupture, the pollen mass 

 is in close contact with what I have shown is the real stigmatic 

 surface. The flower is an absolute self -fertilizer, and can receive 

 no aid from the visits of insects. 



The failure of so many flowers to mature fruit is a matter of 

 nutrition. It has already been seen how easily the axillary bud is 

 induced to displace the leader, by the diversion of nutrition in that 

 direction. There are always two ovaries and corresponding sly lea 

 in each flower of Aselepias. If we open a fertile flower in an early 

 stage of its advance to a fertile condition, we may note that the 

 stronger one has simply starved the other. 



There are other matters in connection with the life-history of 

 Asclepias well worthy of investigation. In Asclepias tuberosa, as 

 in some other species, the petals reflex hurriedly when opening, but 

 close iu again when near maturity. The flowers that become fer- 

 tilized coil as if they were tendrils, and indeed seem to prefer to 

 twine around some object. One might almost expect to find some 

 climbing species in the genus. It has been said that explanations 

 of this character to be acceptable should be able to account for all 

 phenomena of a similar character. In this case, what about the 

 stigmas and general features of Apocynaceae ? Surely the staminal 

 verticil has no relation to the disc-like character of the stigma in 

 some members of the order, Vinea, for instance. But we do not 

 know how far the consolidation of parts has gone. In a double- 

 flowered oleander we note numberless petaldike organs that must 

 have had a separate starting-point, and what appears as a single 




106 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



style is really made up of two, covered by a membrane evidently 

 of staminal origin. 



x. Phyllotaxis in connection with Chesopodiaceje 



AND PoLYGONACE.E. 



Phyllotaxis has not been made much use of by systematists. In 

 a general way recognition has been given to the alternate or oppo- 

 site arrangement of the foliage in connection with orders or genera. 

 We do not expect to find alternate leaves in Rubiaceae, and 

 opposite leaves in Rosacea? would be a surprise. But we may go 

 further. In a general way we may look for a pentamerous arrange- 

 ment of the' floral organs, whenever we find a f- arrangement of the 

 leaves. In Chenopodiacea? and genuine allies, Ave find the J plan 

 prevail. We may doubt the relationship with Chenopodiacese of 

 any plant with a § arrangement. 



In Polygonacea* we find the f arrangement the rule, and a close 

 study of some species of the order shows that, though there are 

 great deviations from a pentamerous structure, the pentamerous is 

 the main plan, and the apparent deviations are the results of abor- 

 tion, or of a union of parts usually separate. 



Fagopyrum eseulentum well illustrates this. The outer series 

 which we take to be the calyx is pentasepalous. There are eight 

 stamens, but if we examine the flower closely we find that there 

 are only five in the verticil succeeding the calycine whorl, and 

 these are alternate with the sepals as they should be. The next 

 verticil appears to be of eight glands; but on close inspection there 

 are but five, and these are alternate with the stamens. Then we 

 have three rather smaller glands, just above the line of the larger 

 ones, and making the eight which come under casual notice, 

 and these three are at the base of the three stamens, which make 

 the eight usually credited to the species. Here a puzzle presents 

 itself. There should be two more glands to make a complete ver- 

 ticil of five, and two more stamens for another perfect verticil, and 

 how does it come about that the stamen is just above the gland and 

 not alternate therewith ? We cannot answer ; but with a clear 

 case of three perfect verticils on the plan of five, we may assume 

 that in some way, as yet unaccounted for, abortion and disarrange- 

 ment of parts at this point have occurred. 



The three upper stamens present an interesting feature that does 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 107 



not appear to have been hitherto noticed. The outer five have an 

 incurved character, but the inner three curve outwardly* and the 

 outer surface of the upper aud lower anthers meet face to face. The 

 pistils have an outward trend, or we may say recurve, as the three 

 inner stamens do. I say pistils, for though it is customary to look 

 on the flower as having but a single deeply cleft pistil, the three- 

 valved ovarium clearly indicates a tricarpellary origin. 



The fact that but a single seed is found in the capsule must be 

 attributed to abortion, just as Ave find but a single seed in many 

 pluri-carpellary rosaceous fruits; and to the same principle of abor- 

 tion that has already operated in breaking up the pentamerous 

 character on which, as we have seen, the flower is normally planned. 

 Instead of a relationship to Chenopodiacea?, as usually suspected, 

 or with Caryophyllaceae, as has been suggested, its proper position 

 is evidently nearer Rosacere than with either. In Spircea, for 

 instance, say Spircea opulifolia L., we have the persistent five-cleft 

 calyx, but only three carpels in many instances, with remarkable 

 irregularity in the number of the seeds. Then, proceeding to 

 Nevmshi, we have the permanent calyx doing service for petals just 

 as we find in Fagopyrum,, and we have a little disc on which are 

 the stamens, corresponding to the glands on which are the Facjo- 

 pyrum stamens. Further, we have the ovaries reduced to two, 

 with a single ovule. 



This conception of the relationship of Polygonacese to the 

 Rosacea? enables us to account for the stipules, characteristic of 

 Rosacea?, but which are wanting in Chenopods. That the ochrea 

 in Polygonacea? is but a stipule which may become united so as to 

 clasp the stem is universally conceded. 



A feature that has been overlooked in Fagopyrum is particularly 

 instructive. Even the most recent descriptive work, Britton and 

 Brown's Illustrated Flora of the Northern State* anil Canada, says 

 of it, ' ' glabrous except at the nodes. ' ' But one-half the stem and 

 its inner face are hairy, only the exterior half is glabrous. It has 

 been wholly my work to show that leaves do not originate at the 

 node from which the leaf-blade springs. I contend that the whole 

 of axis or stem is made up of the sheathing bases of the leaves, the 

 blade being simply the departure of the upper portion, when the 

 cohesive power has been reduced in force. The margin of the leaf- 

 blade in Fagopyrum is ciliate. The line of hair on the stems of 




108 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



the plant are simply the strongly developed cilia on the united edges 

 of the clasping leaf-bases. 



An interesting circumstance in connection with Fagopyrum is the 

 tendency to sterility of the flowers under certain conditions. 

 Farmers know that if buckwheat is sown early in the season, the 

 seed crop is light. Examining plants on the 22d of July, that had 

 come up from self-sown seed in early spring, out of many hundreds 

 of flowers, only one had perfected a seed.- The anthers were des- 

 titute of pollen. This may have been the result of unusual vegeta- 

 tive vigor, which vigor has to be somewhat checked in most plants 

 before fruitfulness is favored. The plants examined were growing 

 in very rich soil, and unusually luxuriant; but the fact shows how 

 much conditions have to do with sexual affairs. 



xi. The influence of fcngi on the forms and 



CHARACTERS OF PLANTS. 



The influence of microscopic fungi in changing the form and 

 character of vegetation is well-known in connection with mon- 

 strous conditions. It does not, however, seem to have occurred 

 to biologists that what occurs in an exaggerated degree may rea- 

 sonably be expected to prevail as a rule. The power that can in- 

 duce vegetation to run into monstrosities may be so able to control 

 its forces as to be a regular factor among the laws of form. 



I believe that Prof. Farlow and some German botanists have 

 recorded cases where the action of minute fungi has changed the 

 character of plants to a degree that might be almost termed specific. 

 I have myself, in a communication to the Academy of Natural 

 Sciences of Philadelphia (see Proceedings, 1874, p. 146) shown 

 that where Euphorbia maculata is attacked by an jEcidium, it 

 assumes characters very little different from Euphorbia lujprrici- 

 folia. Instead of trailing, the plant becomes erect- The hairy 

 stem and fruit become perfectly smooth, and the swelling at the 

 nodes that characterizes the latter species is assumed under the 

 changed conditions. Only for the evidence furnished by the 

 reproductive stage of the fungus, a botanist might well be 

 pardoned for referring the attacked specimens to Euphorbia 

 Jiypericifolia. Assuredly, E. maculata would not be considered in 

 the determination. 



Recently a specimen of a singular combination was placed in my 




1899.] 



NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



109 



hands by Mr. W. Finger, of Milwaukee, Wis. A pair of long- 

 stalked, smooth and shining leaves seemed to proceed from a root 

 stock of Hepatica acutiloba D. C. They were strikingly suggestive 

 of some undescribed species of Banunculvs. The collector was sus- 

 picious that some other plant had man- 

 aged to force its leaves through the root 

 stock of Hepatica, as instances of this 

 behavior in some plants have been 

 known. Though nothing pointing to 

 this could be ascertained, the specimens 

 were sent to me under an impression that 

 there must have been some such occur- 

 rence. The leaf-blades, however, showed, 

 by the slightly developed fructification, 

 that the whole character of the leaf had 

 been changed through the medium of a 

 minute fungus, apparently closely related 

 to an CEcidium, as had been found con- 

 nected with the Euphorbia. 



In the paper on Euphorbia cited, I 

 ventured the proposition, as deduced 

 from the observations recorded, that 

 " certain phases of nutrition brought 

 about by the attack of a fungus may 

 change specific characters." The expe- 

 rience here related not only affirms this 

 proposition, but indicates that the 

 changes induced follow definite lines. 

 In the Euphorbia the result of the opera- 

 tion of the fungus was especially marked 

 by the elongation of the nodes and the 

 total suppression of the hair that densely 

 clothes the species attacked. In this case we have again the hairy 

 character of Hepatica totally obliterated, and the petiole elongated 

 in a striking manner. 



In view of the modern discoveries of symbiotic relations between 

 algre and fungi in the development of lichens, and of species of 

 fungi in connection with thejife-historiesof other plants, there can 

 be no extravagance in the suggestion that in some manner as vet 



Fig. 1. 




110 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



undiscovered these minute organisms may play an important part 

 in the origin of form. In this case nothing but the advance toward 

 .fructification would have furnished ground for suspicion that the 

 leaf was not in a normal condition. 



XII. THE MOVEMENTS OF PLANTS. 



What is known as Heliotropism has never been clearly under- 

 stood. Much that has been referred to the action of the sun may 

 be attributable to other causes. When Moore sang: 



"As the sunflower turns on her God, when he sets, 

 The same look which she turned when he rose," 



he expressed the prevailing thought that the plant, in an active 

 sense, sought the sun or avoided the sun, as the case might be, 

 and not that the sun was the acting direct agent in drawing the 

 flower unwillingly along. 



On August 20, 1898, I was passing a large mass of Helianthus 

 orgyalis at about sundown, and noted that they were taking a wide 

 ^curve toward the northeast, the stronger plants making a curve of 

 nearly a foot in diameter. As the thermometer had been ranging 

 between 80° and 90° Fahr., I passed on with a general impression 

 that excessive transpiration had induced wilting. On the evening 

 of the 25th, observing again this general northeast curve, I 

 attempted to lift one of the curved points, and was surprised to 

 find the stem at that point rigid, and not flaccid, as it would have 

 been if suffering from lack of moisture. Careful and continued 

 •observation was decided on. 



On the 26th, at 6.30 P.M., the stalks which at sundown the 

 previous evening were curving northeast were now erect. On the 

 27th, at 6 P.M., the stalks were curving again northeastwardly. 

 On the 28th, at 11.30 A.M., all were curving slightly south west, 

 and by 2 P.M. the same day were nearly erect. At 6 P.M., 

 with their usual curve northeast. 



On the 31st, at 6.30 A.M., found the first deviation from that 

 general plan in having the curves northeastwardly, instead of 

 having erect stems. At noon they were erect, except a few of the 

 weaker ones which had a northwestern curve. It should be here 

 noted that the terminal flower, which in this and many other com- 

 posite plants is the first to open, while the side branches rapidly 

 develop, was now expanding, but many of the stronger branchlets 




.1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. Ill 



joined with the weaker main stems in this northwestern curve. Even 

 where the main stems by some accident had a southern or eastern 

 leaning, the branchlets had the northwestern curve. Observations 

 were continued till the evening of September 4, all resulting in the 

 •fact that the general rule in this species was that the curving was 

 at nightfall northeastwardly; at 6.30 A.M., erect;, at noon, with a 

 slight curve, and at 6 P.M., a strong curve northeastwardly. 



On September 6, Helianthus Maximilianis had developed con- 

 siderably toward a flowering state. At 7 P.M., all the flower 

 steins were bending slightly westwardly. On the 7th, at 7 A.M., 

 all trending eastwardly; at 6 P.M., westwardly. On the 8th, 

 9th and 10th, the observations were the same. There was no 

 opportunity to note the direction of the stems at midday, but on 

 the 11th they were nearly erect, but with a very slight eastern 

 trend. At 5 P.M., quite erect. By this time the ray florets of 

 the terminal head of flowers were expanding, and no curving was 

 noted subsequently. 



In these observations I thought to note whether the curving was 

 •due to an uncoiling of the spiral growth, or was done by a direct 

 lifting upward and over to the opposite point of the compass. 

 Pins, with their heads pointing east, were inserted in the stems just 

 beneath the terminal flower head. Through all the variation in 

 the direction of the curves, the heads remained unchanged in 

 direction. This proves it was not an uncoiling operation, but 

 done as a purely ascending and descending act. 



Further, these observations show that the curvature proceeds at 

 night to the same extent as by day. Tight, therefore, or the 

 attraction of the sun's rays, must be eliminated from the factors in 

 the work, especially as the evening curvature of one species is in a 

 different direction from the other. So far as these observations 

 go, the cause of motion is still obscure. 



While these observations were in progress, I noted on the even- 

 ing of September 5 that a large plant of Palafoscia linearis that 

 certainly had all its branchlets erect in the morning were beauti- 

 fully curved at P.M., but they were in no particular direction of 

 the compass. The curved branches were so rigid that they resisted 

 considerable force in the endeavor to straighten them. The next 

 day at 7 A.M. they were perfectly straight. The observations 

 were made daily till the 11th, with the same results, the only addi-

tional fact being that the curving seemed to commence about '■) 

 P.M., and to reach its maximum about 5 P.M. The stronger 

 brandies had the greatest curve, in some cases making a complete 

 circle, the point of the brauchlet reaching the main stem, the 

 curve of the weaker branches usually reaching a half circle. On 

 the evening of the 7th I tied a light label weighing au eighth of 

 an ounce to the apex of one strongly curving brauchlet. It had 

 no result in weighing the brauchlet further down. In the morning 

 it still held the branch down to the point I had left it the evening 

 before, though the point beyond the string had grown a little and 

 taken an upward curve. When I cut the string with the point of 

 a scissors, the branch flew upwards with a sudden spring, reducing 

 the curve from a half to the quarter of a circle. The stem retained 

 this light curve during the whole of its subsequent growth. In 

 this connection it may be noted that in the reflex from the curve to 

 erection in He! hurt hit* orgyalis, the stem never reached a perfectly 

 straight line, and hence the stems of this species are geriernUy 

 flexuose. That the curves in Paktfoxia should be in any direction of 

 the compass indifferently, and yet in specified directions only in the 

 two Helianths, is remarkable. 



While taking notes on these plants at dusk one evening, I noted 

 that a plant of Helenium autumnale, with hundreds of unopened 

 flowers, seemed drooping for want of water. Calling the fact to 

 the attention of Mr. Hemming, in charge of my hardy herba- 

 ceous department, he felt sure that it only needed water, and this 

 was copiously applied, with no result. Closer examination showed 

 that the common peduncle was bent in the middle, the upper por- 

 tion forming a right angle with the stem. So rigid was the bend 

 that they could not be straightened Avithout injury. The angle is 

 maintained for a number of days till the ray florets become visi- 

 ble, when the peduncle gradually straightens, taking several days 

 to complete the task. As in the case of the Helianths, pins were 

 inserted in order to note any uncoiling process if present. The 

 straightening was done by a purely ascending process. 



The gain to science by these observations i3 negative. It is 

 clearly seen that what we have understood as heliotropism in con- 

 nection with plant movements has no place in the phenomena. It 

 may be assumed that we have to look to various phases of life- 

 energy in the plants themselves for the final explanation.

xiii. Eccentricity of the annual wood circles in 

 Rhus Toxicodendron l. 



In an abstract of an address 7 made by myself on excrescences 

 and eccentric wood growth in trees, I pointed out that the thicken- 

 ing of the annual layer of wood, more in some portion of the circle 

 than in others, was due to a greater generative power of the cells 

 in the thickened portions owing to more abundant nutrition having 

 reached them. " Where the whole mass of tissue seems equally 

 and regularly vitalized, the generative tissue forms a new layer of 

 wood of about equal thickness all round. " "In some cases 

 masses of cells seem to easily draw from others more than their 

 share (of nutrition), and the latter are correspondingly weakened. " 

 "■ All the cases of peculiar eccentricities, Hedera, Toxicodendron, 

 Ampelopsis, and the peculiar cases in ordinary timber trees, could be 

 explained by this, so far as to note that the immediate law was a 

 loss of generative power in the cells of the annual layer. Of course 

 the indirect causes leading to this would be numerous, and left 

 room for much more investigation." At the conclusion of that 

 address the report published says Mr. Meehan was asked to explain 

 the square section of trunk of Picea amabilis on exhibition at the 

 American Centennial, and the reply was that in all probability the 

 thickened portions of the annual layers at the corners forming the 

 square were due to strong roots near these four corners supplying 

 abundant nutrition in those directions. 



Though twenty-two years have elapsed since that communication 

 was made, the matter does not seem to have been further investi- 

 gated, and our biological text-books still endeavor to explain these 

 variations in the width of the concentric rings to various causes 

 other than the one to which I have alluded. Though the bulk of 

 nutrition must be by way of active roots, the carbon necessary for 

 the structure must be contributed through the leaves. Healthy 

 leaves and vigorous roots must be reciprocal. On the other hand, 

 the power exercised by any force is in inverse ratio to distance ; and 

 it is probable that a weak series of foliage, near the active roots, 

 might aid nutrition to better advantage than stronger ones further 

 away. 



Some interesting observations were recently made on the ordinary

poison vine, Rhus Toxicodendron L. A large stem that had for a 

 quarter of a century been attached to an old cherry tree was cut 

 down. From this were many old branches, which had not attached 

 themselves to anything, and had no rootlets, as those attached to 

 the tree had. In none of these latter cases was theAvood eccentric, 

 while even quite young branches, rooting to the bark of the cherry 

 tree, were eccentric. Fig. 3 shows a section of the main stem, 

 cut across two feet from the ground, showing the attachment by 

 its numerous fibrous rootlets to the old bark at the back. Fig. 2 is 

 a section of a seven-year-old branch which has not thrown out 

 rootlets. From an examination of a number of stems with and with- 

 out rootlets, the fact was clear that the rootlets decided the eccen- 

 tricity. They evidently introduced nutritious matter from the old 

 bark to which they clung, and the cells nearest 

 to them derived the chief advantage. The con- 

 centric rings would inevitably weaken in propor- 

 tion to the distance from the source of supply. 

 If the woody circles had been all of equal thick- 

 ness the pith would have been in . the centre,

In the contribution reported in the Proceedings as above cited, 

 the weakened condition of the wood cells, and their over- 

 growth by stronger ones is 

 given to account for the bark 

 often found inside the trunks 

 of JBauhinia, Wistaria, and 

 other woody plants. We 

 see in Fig. 3 how this can 

 easily be brought about. 

 If some good roots in con- 

 nection with healthy leaves 

 should appear in connec- 

 tion with the lobes repre- 

 sented by the heart-shaped 

 figure so as to reinvigo- 

 rate the depauperate wood 

 cells, the bark would soon 

 meet, and eventually be wholly enclosed. 



It may be added that the fibrous roots of the Poison Vine are

 as we see in Fig.

all annual, but they become very wiry after death, and continue 

 apparently for all time to aid in sustaining the plant's attachment 

 to its support until violently separated by external forces. 



xiv. Morphology of the Grape. 



In referring to the grape or other vitaceous plants, it is custom- 

 ary to say of the tendril that it is a reduced 

 branch. It was long a puzzle to me that a 



Jg 



^\S)/^^^> branch should appear on the opposite side of a 

 ^^^^liK leaf, which leaf should have no axillary bud, 



and, further, it seemed remarkable that when 

 there was an axillarv bud at the base of the 

 leaf, there was no tendril on the opposite 

 side. 



I have since learned that in these cases the plant simply presents 

 to us phenomena very common in plants, especially when forming 



,- an inflorescence, of displacing the leading stem, 



and replacing the leader by the growth of the 



|gA axillary bud. What was the leader is pushed 



S&'^S^liiiiSsM (, n one side, and seems to be, what writers on 



~0f.'.-';. ■.''.i'.^t ■;/'-* T the vine assume the tendril to be, a mere 



''.Ze-t '^■''vV'' branch. In vigorous branches of the grape 



vine, there seems occasionally to be an 



axillary bud opposite the tendril, but this is 



simply a supra-axillary bud, the upper of the two having advanced 



to the position of a leading stem, when the former leader had been 



reduced to the condition of a tendril. 



The fact is of importance in tracing the genital relationship of 

 the order of grape vines with other families. There is much in 

 Vitacea? to suggest an alliance with rhamnaceous plants. In 

 Celastracere, for instance, the character noted in the grape of 

 having the tendril opposite a leaf without an axillary bud is want- 

 ing simply owing to the oppositedeaved method of carrying its 

 foliage. How the growth-energy has been diverted from the 

 leading shoot to the axillary buds is shown in the inflorescence of 

 Euonymm Japonicus. With a further suppression of the leader 

 there would have been dichotomous branching. With an alternate 

 system of leafage, the central axis would have been pushed aside 




116 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



to become a tendril or some other lateral organ. The stronger 

 shoot from the axillary bud would then be the leader. In many 

 rhamnaceous plants, notably in some species of Zizyphus, though 

 the axillary bud has sufficient force to occupy a position erect and 

 in a direct hue with the branch that bore it, thus pushing aside 

 the former leader, it has not energy enough to maintain the leader- 

 ship. The main branch, though forced from the direct line, con- 

 tinues to lead, and then we have the zigzag or flexuose stem. 



Another evidence of the close relationship of Yitacea? with the 

 rhamnaceous family is furnished by an occasional tendency in 

 grape berries to assume a valvate capsular form. A case of this 

 some kind fell under the notice of Fl. Von Schlechtendal, who 

 thought it of varietal importance. He figures and describes it 

 in the volume of Linncea for 1830 as ViHs vinifera capsularis. 

 Morphology had not reached the importance it has arrived at 

 to-day. My first opportunity to examine a case of the kind was 

 furnished by Dr. James A. Darrach, of Germantown, Philadelphia, 

 who found it on a bunch of the Flame-colored Tokay, common on 

 our fruit stands as the California grape. It is capsular, five-parted, 

 disclosing the naked seeds attached to an axile placenta, the whole 

 very suggestive of some celastraceous plant. 



The grape is notorious for other morphological vagaries, among 

 which the total absence of seeds in some varieties is to the point. 

 The Corinth, Mokunha and Sultana are also cases. These furnish 

 the currants of commerce. Seedless berries are common among the 

 fertile ones in many varieties of American species. In one known 

 in gardens as the Lindley, one-half of the berries will be seedless, 

 and sometimes the whole bunch will be of that character. In 

 these the berries do not reach more than one-half the size of the 

 seed-bearing ones. The manner in which this variation is accom- 

 plished has been ably set forth in the London Journal of Horti- 

 culture, of September 3, 1896. It is well-known that many fruits 

 will advance considerably in size in the absence of pollination. 

 The fruits are seedless, and they never reach the dimensions of the 

 fertilized fruits. The osage orange and the cucumber are familiar 

 instances. In the growth of cucumbers under glass every female 

 flower produces a cucumber, but if the grower desires large and fine 

 fruit, he uses the male flowers directly on the females. The 

 isolated female osage orange has the seedless " halls" but half 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 117 



the size of the fertile ones. In the paper on the grape above cited, 

 the author traced the successive stages of growth in the fruit by 

 the aid of a powerful microscope. The mother or berry-bearing 

 plant has the power of growth up to a certain stage. Ovarium, 

 ovules and every part advances up to about half the size of the 

 full-grown stage, when it awaits the entrance of the pollen tube. 

 If this tube fails to appear at this stage, the funiculus or neck 

 connecting the ovule with the placenta dies, and this ends all future 

 growth. The grape is a plant having female flowers, male flowers 

 and neuters. It is among the latter that the currants or seedless 

 grapes appear. The ovaries and ovules are perfectly formed, but 

 the stigma is impei'fect and will not admit the entrance of the 

 pollen tubes.

SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE ILLECELLEWAET AND ASTTLKAN 

 GLACIEES OF BRITISH COLUMBIA. 



BY GEORGE AND WILLIAM S. YAUX, JR. 



With but a very few exceptions it seems to be a rule at the 

 preseut time that all glaciers are receding up the valleys into which 

 they extend. Whether this will be a permanent recession, or 

 whether a period will come during which an advance will take place, 

 time alone will tell. That there has been a permanent recession 

 the numerous moraines below the prominent glaciers bear ample 

 witness, but they also show that there have been many advances 

 between the periods of recession. 



The glaciers of the Canadian Rockie3 offer many attractions to 

 those interested in their action, both on account of the newness of 

 the region in which they are located and their marked activitv. 

 The Canadian Pacific Railway, without which this region would be 

 almost inaccessible, was first opened but a little over a dozen 

 years ago, and before that time it was practically an unbroken 

 wilderness. Among the most accessible glaciers from the line of 

 the railway are those in the vicinity of the Glacier House, which 

 is situated in the heart of the Selkirk range, at an elevation of 

 4,122 feet above sea level. With this point as a centre a score of 

 glaciers may be reached. It seems to form a natural station for 

 their observation. 



The most accessible, and in some respects one of the most re- 

 markable, is the Great or Illecellewaet Glacier, situated about one 

 and one-half miles in a direct line from the station. The immense 

 neve which feeds it, lies on the top of the range forming the divide, 

 and from it several branches flow down into as many valleys. The 

 Great Glacier is notable on two accounts : its freedom from dirt at 

 its foot, and the remarkable rapidity of the ice fall. One of the 

 first persons to make observations on this glacier was Dr. William 

 S. Green, F.R.G.S. , who in 1888 spent some time in surveying 

 and exploring the region. He records that in twelve days the cen- 

 tre of the ice moved twentv feet, while at the side it moved onlv 




122 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



seven feet. He also notes " that the snout of the glacier showed 

 evidence of retreat, for there were two rows of boulders in front of 

 it. The outer one, about sixty feet from the ice, seemed to have 

 been dropped the previous year; the inner row during the present 

 year." 1 



Since that time the glacier has been visited by a number of per- 

 sons who have located the snout as respects certain marked rocks, 

 or in some other way, but in many instances the record has become 

 lost or uncertain so as to be of little value. At the present time 

 the glacier is rapidly receding, and from an examination of the 

 bare moraine and scrub below it, there seems to be evidence that 

 this has been going on actively for a comparatively short period. 



July 16, 1887 — one year before Dr. Green — we first visited 

 the glacier, and made a number of photographs of its foot (PI. 

 III). These photographs, after a lapse of over eleven years, make 

 possible an exceedingly interesting comparison of the position of 

 the ice. At the present time there is a broad space of loose 

 boulders below the snout, utterly devoid of vegetation. In 1887 

 alder bushes grew within twenty feet of the ice. The slope of 

 the ice was also very different from what it is now. There was 

 then a great mass with steep sides extending over the present bare 

 space, while now the ice slopes comparatively evenly till it dies 

 away altogether in the stream. The fact that during eleven years 

 the alder bushes have not advanced on the retreat of the ice, and 

 that in 1887, when the photographs were taken, they were so close 

 to it, would seem to indicate that at least for a score of years pre- 

 vious to 1887 the glacier had not extended materially further into 

 the valley than it did at that time. Taking into consideration the 

 border moraine marking the position of the ice in 1887, the alder 

 bushes which then, as now, grew up to the lower side of the mo- 

 raine, and which have increased but little in size during the eleven 

 years, and the characteristic steepness of the slope of the ice, it 

 would seem probable that a period of advance had occurred shortly 

 before the year 1887. One very small moraine about 200 feet 

 from the snout of 1898 showed au insignificant advance since that 

 period, but apart from this the motion of the glacier appears to 

 have been only of recession.

Photography seems to offer the most satisfactory means of per- 

 manently recording the position of the ice from year to year. On 

 our visit, therefore, to the Great Glacier in 1898, a large rock was 

 chosen on the south side of the trail, below the bridge, and some 

 five hundred yards from the ice foot. The 1898 test view was 

 taken from this position on the 19th of August (PL V). The 

 small moraine in the lower right-hand corner is the one mentioned 

 by Dr. Green, and shown in the pictures of 1887. The large 

 rock marked " E " was then partly encased in the ice, as will be 

 seen in the centre of the 1887 picture, and forms a most excellent 

 point for identification (PL IV). In conjunction with the photo- 

 graph a number of range rocks on the moraine were selected and 

 marked for identification. The rocks " B" and " D" on the 

 photograph were chosen because they were of unusual size, and 

 were far enough from the ice to prevent any movement. A line 

 ■drawn between them August 17, 1898, passed eighteen inches 

 below the extreme snout of the glacier at " H." " B " is a large 

 rock, with a triangular black mark on the north side. It was 

 lettered with Venetian red paint as follow.-: 



•86<-II-IIIA 



VIII-17-'98. 



*' D " is a yellow rock which has been split in halves. It was 

 marked on one piece, " Rock opposite lines with snout, VIII— 17— 

 '98," and on the side opposite with a vertical line and two arrows. 

 The rock " G " was not marked, but may be easily identified by 

 the photograph. Its highest point was fifty -nine feet to the nearest 

 ice on August 17, 1898. 



To locate the position of the snout, the rock " C," a long, 

 rounded boulder, was chosen. It was marked " 60' 0" to snout, 

 VIII-17-'98," and with arrows. 



During the warm weather of August the rate of recession was 

 very rapid, and a few days made a marked change in the posi- 

 tion of the ice. October 24, 1898, Mr. Hugh B. Walkem, of 

 Vancouver, visited the glacier and compared the position of the 

 ice with the rocks marked by us, sixty-eight days before. He 

 found that the snout had receded forty-six feet in that interval, or 

 eight and one-tenth inches per day. 



As respects the annual rate of recession it is hard to obtain reli- 




124 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899.. 



able data as a foundation. There are several rocks on the moraine 

 which bear marks or dates as old as 1890, but most of them are so 

 worn as to be almost illegible. We found one, however, near the 

 border moraine above referred to which, if it had not been moved, 

 indicated that in August, 1890, the snout was sixteen feet above a 

 certain mark. The distance from that mark to the snout in 

 August, 1898, was four hundred and fifty- two (452) feet, or an 

 average annual recession of fifty-six (56) feet, during the period of 

 eight years. There is reason to believe, however, that for a part 

 of this period the glacier remained more nearly stationary, and in 

 the remaining years made up for the deficiency by a much more 

 rapid melting away. 



The Asulkan Glacier being situated at the head of the valley of 

 the same name and about four miles distant from the Glacier House 

 is not nearly so easy of access for observation. Its neve is con- 

 nected with that of the Illecellewaet over the ridge which separates 

 them, so that while they flow into separate valleys they rise from 

 practically the same source. We are not aware that any work has 

 been done upon this glacier, as it is probably not visited by more 

 than a score of persons in the course of the year. The rapidly 

 descending stream from its foot, which is joined by another from 

 the glaciers in the immense amphitheatre to the east, passes through 

 a narrow canon a quarter of a mile below the snout. In this canon 

 there appeared to be no sign of glacial action, which would indicate 

 that the ice had extended below this point only before the formation 

 of the canon. A very large moraine flanking the glacier on the 

 west also pointed to the fact that the ice had not receded materially 

 in recent years. 



The same methods were pursued here as in the case of the 

 Illecellewaet Glacier. A very large rock, the top of which was 

 smoothly glaciated, was chosen on the east side of the stream below 

 the glacier, and the test picture was taken, August 23, 1898 (PI. 

 VI). While it records the general outline of the ice, it does not 

 locate the snout, which seemed to be deeply buried in moraine. 

 Apart from thus fixing the position of the ice on this date, it was 

 impossible to draw any conclusions, as there are no previous records 

 with which to make comparisons.

A SNOW-INHABITING ENCHYTRJEID Mesenchytraeus solifugus Emery) 



COLLECTED BY MR. HENKY G. BRYANT ON THE MALASPINA 



GLACIER. ALASKA. 



BY J. PERCY MOOBE. 



The material upon which the present account is based was col- 

 lected by Mr. Henry G. Bryant upon the snow of the Malaspina 

 Glacier, while conducting explorations on Mt. St. Elias during the 

 summer of 1897. The habitat of the worm is so unusual that a 

 somewhat detailed account of its structure and habits seems desir- 

 able. 



The mature examples, of which a considerable number were 

 secured, are slender and linear, having about the form of Friderida 

 long a. They possess on an average 55 somites | 43 to 58), and 

 measure 15-20 mm. in length by .ti-.7 mm. in greatest diameter 

 (somite XII). At the oral end is a short, bluntly rounded and 

 somewhat swollen prostomium. The oral somite is slightly en- 

 larged and sharply marked off from the succeeding somite by a 

 deep furrow. Somites II to V inclusive are somewhat depressed, 

 the remainder of the worm being terete. In contracted specimens 

 these anterior somites are distinctly divided into three annuli each. 

 After increasing gradually to somite XII, the diameter remains 

 quite uniform to about one millimeter from the posterior end, 

 whence it narrows rather abruptly to the truncate anal ring. 



In none of the specimens examined (about twenty in number) is 

 the clitellum very distinctly developed, but on the contrary is thin 

 and scarcely extends beyond the limits of the twelfth somite. 



Dorsal pores are entirely absent from the somites, but there is a 

 well-marked cephalic pore near the apex of the prostomium, 

 fig. 7, cp. The external openings of the spermathecse are situ- 

 ated in the centres of a pair of conspicuous elliptical swollen areas 

 (figs. 1 and 2, si.), corresponding to the intersegmental furrow 

 IV— V. These areas are much larger, more glandular, and more 

 conspicuous than is usual in the Encbytrseidse. They lie toward 

 ■the ventral rather than the dorsal body surface, and the sperma- 




126 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



thecal pores are between the levels of the ventral and dorsal seta? 

 bundles. 



Equally conspicuous in preserved worms are the often partially 

 everted male genital bursa?, which appear as a pair of prominent 

 papilla? (penes) on the ventral face of somite XII (figs. 1 and 

 2, cT). At their apices are the male pores — triradiate slits 

 with two short mesial limbs and a longer ectal one (fig. 1). 

 When the bursa? are not everted, the male pores have the form of 

 transverse slits on slightly elevated papilla?. The female pores 

 (figs. 1 and 2, 9) are very small, and are found only with some 

 difficulty in entire worms. They are in line with the male pores 

 and situated at the intersegmental furrow XII-XIII. The general 

 characters of the anterior end of the worm are shown in figs. 1 

 and 2. 



The seta? have the form usual in the genus, being feebly sigmoid 

 and arranged in fan -shaped bundles, but are mostly imperfect, 

 owing to the points being worn or broken off. The dorsal (lateral) 

 bundles coutain usually two, sometimes three, the ventral three to 

 six in the preclitellial region, and usually four or five behind the 

 clitellum. The ventx*al bundles are more conspicuous, not only 

 because of the greater number of seta? which they contain, but 

 also because these seta? are of somewhat larger size than the dorsal 

 ones. Enlarged seta? are found in the ventral bundles of XI ; these 

 are about one-third longer and much thicker than the others. Seta? 

 are absent from somite I, and the ventral bundles normally from 

 XII. On the latter the ventral bundles are partially replaced by 

 groups of pigmented glandular cells which lie ectad to the male 

 pores. Sometimes a single small seta persists in this region. The 

 dorsal bundles are sometimes also reduced on this somite and may 

 be represented by two seta?, by one seta, by the pigmented glands 

 or have disappeared altogether (as in one series of sections). 



A very striking peculiarity of the species is the yellow-brown, 

 deep chocolate-brown or almost black color, and its opacity. Mr. 

 Bryant informs me that the worms were quite as conspicuously 

 colored in life. Several of the specimens are marked by more or 

 less complete white or yellow rings which are the result of ruptures 

 of the epidermis along the intersegmental furrows, permitting the 

 underlying muscular layer to show through. As Mr. Bryant states 

 that these bands were present when the worms were collected, the 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 127 



injuries may be the result of previous freezing. Unstained sections 

 show that the pigment is in the form of minute granules deposited 

 thickly in the epidermal cells. These granules form a very densely 

 packed stratum toward the outer surface of the cells, but become 

 fewer and finally altogether absent toward their basal surface (fig. 

 8). Pigmentation is not confined to the outer surface of the body, 

 but affects as well all internal epithelia which have been derived 

 from ectodermal invaginations, as the setigerous glands, lining of 

 buccal cavity and pharynx, genital bursa?, stalk of the spermatheca?, 

 terminal vesicles of the nephridia and the lateral portions of the 

 nerve cord. 



Except that it is deeply cleft in front where its angles pass into 

 the circumoesophageal connectives, the supra-cesophageal ganglion 

 is nearly quadrate; the posterior border is almost straight. It is 

 situated in somites I and II (fig. 4 and fig. 7, eg.). The body 

 walls are unusually thin for an Enchytraeid, which results from 

 the weakness of the longitudinal musculature (fig. 8). The 

 dorsal blood vessel becomes free from the alimentary canal in the 

 clitellar somite (XII). It contains a usually inconspicuous car- 

 diac body composed of two or three rows of cells. 



No important peculiarities are apparent in the structure of the 

 alimentary canal. The pharyngeal pad (fig. 2), occupies the 

 second and third somites. It is preceded in the first somite by 

 a pair of lateral appendages which project into the lumen of the 

 buccal chamber. When retracted it forms the cephalic wall of a 

 dorsal pouch, the posterior wall of which is the much-folded 

 pharyngeal wall. Otherwise the alimentary canal is simply saccu- 

 lated, and ciliated throughout. The chlorogogue cells begin in IV. 

 They are very high and slender, the bodies very transparent, but 

 filled with pigment (?) granules and fat like globules. Large 

 septal glands are attached to the posterior faces of septa IV- V, 

 V— VI and VI-VII, and occupy the greater part of the succeeding 

 somites. There are no salivary glands (peptonephridia of Benham). 



Nephridia are situated in every somite posterior to VII. These 

 organs t^ach consists of a long, narrow tube, very closely and intri- 

 cately folded ; but the loops do not communicate laterally with one 

 another to form a plexus. Throughout its course the lumen is 

 relatively large and the walls thin, so that the character of a tube 

 is not obscured, as in many Enchytraeidse. The folded tube forms 




128 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



a compact mass divided into several lobes, of which a long, nar- 

 row ventral one, from the middle of which the efferent duct arises, 

 and a short, broad, dorsal one are the principal. The part of the 

 organ just described is postseptal. Only the small funnel and its 

 stalk project through the septum into the somite next anterior. 



The testes (fig. 3, t. ), are attached to the body floor close to 

 the root of the septum X-XI, and rather near to the middle 

 line. Their products are shed while in early developmental stages 

 into the cavity of somite XI, from which some find their way into 

 X, but most pass into the sperm sacs to complete their develop- 

 ment. The sperm sacs (fig. 3, ss. and rss. ), are paired, but only 

 the left one has any functional importance. Both arise from the 

 septum XII-XIII, rather high up beside the intestine. Both are 

 simple hollow tubular outgrowths whose walls have the same struc- 

 ture as the septa, being formed of a double layer of the very deli- 

 cate coelomic endothelium, with a very delicate and imperfectly 

 developed muscular stratum between. That of the right side 

 (m.) is almost rudimentary, being narrow and confined to somite 

 XII. in which it ends blindly, or possibly unites with the 

 left after passing around to the ventral side of the intestine. 

 Owing to the delicacy of its walls and the crowding of other 

 organs, this point could not be certainly determined in the three 

 series of sections studied. All appearances are, however, in favor 

 of the interpretation expressed in fig. 3. The left sperm sac is 

 greatly developed. Extending caudad from its origin through 

 somite XII it passes to the ventral side of the intestine, and then 

 occupying more or less approximately the middle line and perfor- 

 ating the successive septa, it continues into somite XX, in the pos- 

 terior part of which it terminates blindly. At each septum it is 

 constricted, but bellies out in the somites, and when filled with 

 developing spermatogonia is the most conspicuous body in a section, 

 not excepting the alimentary canal. Comparing it with the size of 

 the testes it is a matter for wonder how the latter can produce 

 sufficient spermatogonia to keep the former packed as full as they are 

 usually found. The spermatogonia must divide many times. 



The sperm funnels (fig. 3, sf.), have the large size, glandu- 

 lar appearance and narrow lumen so usual in the Enchy- 

 toeidse, and occupy most of the space by the side of the intestine 

 in somite XI, the posterior septum of which is crowded backward. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 129 



Of a somewhat truncate pyriform shape, they are bent on them- 

 selves in such a manner that their mouths are directed toward the 

 openings of the sperm sacs, while their stalks perforate the septum 

 ventrad to the lattt r and pass into the sperm ducts. The sperm 

 ducts (fig. 3, *d.) are remarkably long — about fifteen times aa long 

 as the sperm funnels — and form a pair of much coiled and twisted 

 loops reaching in a typical example into somite XVIII. That of 

 the right side enters the ovisac by its mouth and remains coiled 

 within it by the side of the aggregated ova for the remainder of its 

 course. In fig. 3 it is represented, for the sake of simplicity, as a 

 straight loop. The left sperm duct lies free in the bodv cavity 

 passing through the septa by the side of the left sperm sac, ventrad 

 to which most of its coils lie. The sperm ducts are composed of a 

 cubical epithelium and are ciliated throughout. Before entering 

 the atrium in somite XII the recurrent limbs of the sperm ducts 

 expand into narrow fusiform sacs (fig. 3, ■<?.), having glandular, 

 epithelial and muscular walls, which receive the ductules of a group 

 of unicellular spermiducal glands. This structure probably serves 

 to form and eject the spermatophores. A narrow curved duct, 

 which is also provided with some unicellular glands, perforates the 

 mesial wall of the atrium and opens into its lumen. 



Unlike the remainder of the male efferent apparatus, the 

 atrium (fig. 3, a), is, in part, of ectodermal origin, as is indi- 

 cated by the pigmented lining epithelium. It is a spheroidal thick- 

 walled partly eversible sac, with an internal cavity having a mush- 

 roomlike shape in the retracted organ. Its walls are composed of 

 a cuticle-covered, rather deep, pigmented and perhaps glandular 

 epithelium, surrounded by a thick muscular layer in which the 

 fibres are partly longitudinal, but largely radial, especially about 

 the place of entrance of the sperm duct. A number of groups of 

 unicellular glands are attached to the organ, and probably empty 

 into its lumen. The external opening is described above. 



The ovaries (fig. 3, or.), arise from the floor of the body- 

 cavity at the foot of the septum XI-XII. The ovipores have the 

 usual Enclvytrseid form and relation. Their position is noted 

 above. A single ovisac (fig. 3, ovs.), is present. This is pushed 

 back from the septum XII-XIII, just dorsad to the sperm sac, 

 which behind this point displaces it to the right for the greater 

 part of its length. The sac is long and cylindrical, much con- 




130 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



stricted at the septa and is occupied, in addition to the ova, by one 

 of the sperm ducts. In those specimens in which it is best devel- 

 oped it ends in somite XXII, but in some specimens it is less devel- 

 oped, and doubtless varies as in other species of Mesenchytrirn*. 

 Sometimes ova are present in the posterior part only, in which case 

 the anterior part, occupied by the sperm duct, is difficult to dis- 

 tinguish. 



The paired spermathecse (fig. 5) open externally between IV 

 and Y, and on a level midway between the dorsal and ventral 

 setse bundles. The epidermis about the opening is thickened in 

 an elliptical area, owing to the presence of numerous unicellular 

 glands. The stalk has a narrow lumen and thick walls made up 

 as follows: (1) A thick liniug cuticle; (2) a very deep epithe- 

 lium consisting of a layer of cells divided into an inner (lumenal), 

 which is unstained, and an outer (basal), stained and nucleated 

 zone; at the plane of separation is a ring of pigment granules; (3) 

 a very regular layer of longitudinal muscle fibres, one deep; (4) 

 a layer of enlarged peritoneal cells, largest posteriorly and dor- 

 sally, and much smaller on the side toward the septum. The stalk 

 passes mesiad along the septum, then turns dorsad and caudad, the 

 muscular and peritoneal glandular layers cease, and the Avails lie- 

 come thinner as the organ expands into the ampulla, which is some- 

 times very spacious, sometimes, as in the specimen figured, quite 

 contracted. At the point where the stalk expands into the ampulla 

 arise three slender, thin-walled diverticula, usually two from the 

 outer and one from the inner (mesial) face. They vary in length, 

 the longest about equalling the stalk. The ampulla? of the two 

 sides open into one another, and the common sac thus formed by a 

 small pore into the oesophagus on its dorsal side. 1 The epithelium 



1 I find upon reexamining the material that several of the more slender 

 and lighter-colored worms which I had taken for immature individuals pos- 

 sess sperinathecse of quite a different form. They are much smaller than 

 those of M. solifugus and lack the diverticula entirely ; they are simple 

 cluh-shaped sacs, without specially enlarged ampullae, and communicate 

 neither with one another nor with the oesophagus. The epidermis ahout the 

 spermathecal openings is not thickened. The male genital organs also 

 differ ; the saccus ejaculatorius is smaller, the walls of the atria less thick, 

 and the external pore much less conspicuous. The posterior horder of the 

 supra-cesophageal ganglion is concave. These characters are exhibited 

 by three specimens. The poor state of preservation of the specimens per- 

 mits no further description. For this species the name Mesenchytrwus 

 nit-us, which has not yet been published for the other, is proposed. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 131 



of the ampulla? is of a character intermediate between that of the 

 stalk and the diverticula. 



As established by Eisen ('78) as a subgenus, MesenchytrcBW 

 included Enchytra?ida? having sigmoid seta?, a relatively short 

 sperm duct, and a supra-oesophageal ganglion which, while truncate 

 (straight or slightly convex) on the caudal margin, is deeply cleft 

 cephalad'; bee-ides these characters certain peculiarities of the 

 spermatozoa were mentioned. Michaelsen's studies ('88 a ) on M. 

 setosus and other species have led him to add two very important 

 and, among the Enchytra?ida?, unique characters, viz., the presence 

 of septal sperm sacs and ovisacs, and of lobate nephridia, in which 

 the closely folded tubule can be traced as such. All described 

 species of Mesenchytneus, which, following the usage of Michael- 

 sen, is now ranked as a full genus, agree also in the possession of 

 the following characters, in respect to which the genera of Enchy- 

 tneida? differ among themselves. The seta? are sigmoid and are 

 asymmetrically arranged in the bundles, of which the ventral con- 

 tain (at least anteriorly) a greater number of seta? than the dorsal. 

 Dorsal pores are absent, but a large head-pore is situated near the 

 apex of the prostomium. The dorsal blood vessel arises within 2 or 

 caudad to the clitellum and contains a cellular heart-body. The 

 blood is colorless. Salivary glauds are absent. The supra- 

 <esophageal ganglion is broader than long, deeply cleft anteriorly 

 and straight or slightly convex posteriorly. The nephridia haw 

 very small anteseptal portions consisting of the funnel only, and 

 large irregular massive postseptal portions. The sperm-duct is not 

 more than ten times (Michaelsen says eight times) as long as the 

 funnel. This statement of characters is derived mainly from 

 Michaelsen's Synopsis ('89). 



The " snow-worm" described above, presents all of these char- 

 acters with the exception of the relatively short sperm ducts, which 

 are about fifteen times as long as the funnels. The slight modifi- 

 cation of the generic definition made necessary to receive this species 

 is, however, unimportant, in view of the considerable variability 

 in the length of this organ exhibited by species already known. 

 In M. feneslratus Eisen ('78), the ducts but just equal the funnel 

 in length, in M. falciform is Eisen they are six times and in M. 



- In an undescribed species from the neighborhood of Philadelphia. 




132 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1899. 



beaumeri Michaelsen ('87) eight times as long. According to 

 Eisen the relative lengths of ducts and funnels vary greatly within 

 the limits of the single species M. mirabilis Eisen ('79), in some 

 individuals the former being but four times, in others as much as 

 ten times as long as the latter. 



M. solifugus is, however, a very distinct species, whose nearest ally 

 seems to be M. mirabilis Eisen. According to Michaelsen ('87), 

 the latter species has a single sperm and a single ovisac, both of 

 which are greatly elongated caudad and constricted at the septa. 

 It further approaches solifugus in the elongation of the sperm ducts. 

 The entrance of a sperm duct into the ovisac has not been de- 

 scribed for any other member of the genus, in which these ducts 

 are usually coiled up within the limits of somite XII. But the 

 relation of the sperm ducts, and particularly of the right one, 

 to the mouth of the ovisac, is such as to permit of ready entrance, 

 and it may in future be found to take this position in some other 

 species. The enlargement of the outer end of the sperm duct and 

 its glandular appendages are better developed in this than in other 

 species. 



With but very few exceptions, the Enchytrseidse are translucent 

 and colorless, or have but very little integumental pigmentation. 

 Very remarkable and distinctive therefore is the thick opaque 

 deposit of pigment granules in the epidermis of this species, and 

 the conditions under which the worm lives make an explanation all 

 the more difficult to find. 



The foregoing description and much that follows were written and 

 the accompanying drawings prepared in December, 1897. The paper 

 was then laid aside pending some projected experiments designed 

 to determine the physical factors effective in stimulating the pro- 

 duction of pigments in the Oligochreta. No opportunity for carry- 

 ing out this plan has been found, and in the meantime Prof. Emery 

 has described the worm in two short papers ('98 a and '98 b ) under 

 the name Uelanenchytrceiis solifugus from specimens collected on 

 the Malaspina Glacier by Dr. Filippi, of Prince Luigi's party. 

 The description is communicated at the present time at the request 

 of Mr. Bryant. I had called the worm Mesenchytrceus nivus, 

 a name which is now discarded, owing to the earlier publication of 

 Emery. 



To the new genus Melanenehytrceus the following characters are- 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 133 



attributed by the describer: Epidermis pigmenled; each segment ex- 

 cept the first bears a dorsal and ventral bundle of sette; the ventral 

 bundle is lacking on somite XII, its position corresponding to the 

 male pore ; the sperm ducts form convoluted loops which extend into 

 somite XV, and terminate in fusiform enlargements which receive 

 the prostate glands and open into the bursse ; the spermatic sacs are 

 large and extend through several segments; the spermathecse do 

 not communicate with the intestine, but are continuous the one 

 with the other, and have each at the base of the ampulla two or 

 three diverticula; the nephridia are much convoluted, with few 

 nuclei; the dorsal vessel begins in XII, and contains a cardiac 

 gland; there is a cephalic pore, but no dorsal pores; in the pharyn- 

 geal epidermis are found numerous branching pigment cells; there 

 are no salivary glands and the oesophagus is continuous without 

 special modification into the intestine; the coelom of somites IV to 

 VIII is for the most part filled with unicellular glands. 



Nearly all of these characters, as has been pointed out above, 

 are common to all species of Me*enchytrtrus ; only the following 

 -of those mentioned by Emery are at all peculiar, viz., the 

 pigmented epidermis, spermatheca without openings into the oesoph- 

 agus, the elongated sperm ducts and the origin of the dorsal vessel 

 in the clitellar somite. The first, although very remarkable, can 

 hardly be given generic value. The second is an error, as the 

 spermatheca do communicate with the oesophagus by a small pore; 

 nor is the union of the two spermatheca? unique, as I find this char- 

 acter in a Philadelphia species which is strictly Mesenchytrseid 

 in every other respect. The unimportance of the relative lengths 

 of the sperm duct and funnel has already been commented upon. 

 The extension of the ducts posteriorly beyond the limits of 

 somite XII is more important, but a similar course of the sperm 

 ducts is described by Eisen for Enehytrceiis (Xeoenchytrcens'j 

 vejdovskyi, while in other members of this genus the ducts are 

 closely coiled within somite XII. Michael>en lays consider- 

 able stress on the origin of the dorsal blood vessel anterior or 

 posterior to the clitellum, but the character cannot of itself be of 

 much importance, owing to its variability. Thus in M. beaumeri 

 Mich, the dorsal vessel arises in XVIII, in M. flavidm Mich, in 

 XIII, and in an undetermined American species in XII. It 

 seems to me, therefore, that the creation of the new genus Melan- 




134 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899* 



enchytrcexis for M. solifugus is unnecessary, and the species is here 

 referred to Mesenchytrceus. 



The following account of the habits and environment of the 

 snow-worms is due to Mr. Bryant: 



' ' The snow- worms were first observed a few hundred yards from 

 our first camp, on the edge of the snow mantle of the glacier, 

 which at this time (June 17) extended to within a few miles of 

 the terminal face of the glacier. By the first of August this 

 snow mantle, which in places was six or seven feet in depth, had 

 entirely disappeared, exposing the hard, compact ice of the glacier. 

 The elevation of the first snow-camp referred to was 520 feet 

 above sea level. Here but few specimens of the worms were 

 noted. At our second camp on the snow (elevation 1,260 feet), 

 they were quite abundant in places, as also at our next camp (ele- 

 vation 1,580 feet), where their presence in large numbers irregularly 

 dispersed presented the appearance of blotches of coarse dust on 

 the snow. Our base- camp was on a small expanse of snow- 

 free ground on the south slope of a range of foothills abutting on 

 the main range at an altitude of 1,750 feet. A few worms were 

 observed on the adjacent snow of the main glacier, at a somewhat 

 lower elevation; but I do not recall seeing any representatives of 

 this species on any of our excursions in the upper snuw fields of 

 the region. 



" During the month of June and early part of July, while the 

 snow is comparatively dry, they appear about four o'clock in the 

 afternoon on the surface and move sluggishly about, their dark 

 color being quite conspicuous against the white background. They 

 remain on the surface during the night ; but when the sun appears 

 in the morning they again burrow into the snow. They were 

 widely distributed over the entire snow-field of the glacier, dimin- 

 ishing in numbers toward the edges. There was no uniformity in 

 their dispersion. We did most of our sledging at night, and 

 frequently passed stretches of snow several hundred yards in 

 extent without noticing any specimens, and then would come to 

 irregularly defined areas which seemed to support colonies of them, 

 where the snow showed shadowy, dustlike patches caused by their 

 presence in considerable numbers. As showing their sensitiveness 

 to heat, I frequently observed their active wriggling as soon as a 

 piece of snow containing them was taken in the hand. Later in 




189;).] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 135 



the season, -when the melting is further advanced and the snow 

 saturated -with moisture, the worms appear to become more active, 

 and can be observed moving about in the shallow pools and lakelets 

 which form on the surface of the glacier. 



' ' When the snow entirely disappeared and the hard ice surface of 

 the glacier appeared, the snow-worms were observed in the water 

 which formed in the narrow crevasses. In my notes of August 2, 

 I find the following: ' Collected some black worms to-day in a 

 crack of the glacier — found them in the water of a high, narrow 

 crevasse. Observed them on the edge of the submerged snow at a 

 depth of five feet below the surface. The worms seem to have a 

 browner color than when found on the snow earlier in the season. 

 Some of the specimens I obtained had also distinct whitish bands 

 around their bodies.' 



" This variation in color is noticeable in the specimens collected 

 in spring and late summer. As may be supposed, there is a 

 marked absence of animal life on the surface of the glacier, which 

 has an estimated length of seventy miles and a width of twenty- 

 five or thirty miles. Wild geese were found nesting on the terminal 

 moraine near the coast in June. The desolate monotony of the 

 snow horizon was broken only on two or three occasions by the 

 appearance of two species of Arctic gulls. Six species of moths, 

 four species of spiders (one new species), and a number of flies, 

 which included two or three new species, were collected on the 

 glacier. The only insect found associated with the snow-worms 

 was a minute black Thysanurian, which resembled at first glance a 

 flea. This has been determined by Dr. Henry Skinner as Achorutes 

 :ii cicala. These insects were found continuously and constantly 

 associated with the worms in the dry snow, and, later on, in the 

 pools of water. They were very active and leaped about like fleas. 

 In no instance were lichens observed associated with the worms, 

 although at several localities on the glacier pale crimson spots on 

 the snow indicated the presence of the minute cryptogamic plants 

 (Protococcw nivalis') which give rise to the ' red snow ' frequently 

 observed by Arctic travellers. The mean temperature of day and 

 night on the expedition has not yet been computed; but I should 

 estimate that the mean temperature at night was about 32°, and 

 in the day about 55°." 



It is a remarkable and interesting: fact that the insect fauna of 




136 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



snow-fields consists almost entirely of species which are either black 

 or very dark colored, although closely related species living amid 

 different surroundings may be brightly decorated. That this is true 

 in certain cases, as of the snow-inhabiting Campodeai of the Alps, 

 Deesoria gladalis and Degeeria nivalis, is well known to zoologists, 

 but the all but universality of the fact is not fully appreciated, 

 except among entomologists who have studied Alpine and boreal 

 forms. As long ago as 1834 Frobel and Heer pointed out the 

 existence of this relation between the pigmeDtation of insects and a 

 snowy environment. They have compiled ('34, II, 97) tables 

 showing the increase of dark pigments among the representatives 

 of many species and. genera of Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, 

 Arachnida, etc., as they extend to and beyond the snow line on the 

 Alps or toward the north on the European continent. 



A related fact is that insects which mature and become active 

 during the winter in this latitude are likely to be black, or at least 

 dark colored, although closely related species which are active at 

 other seasons are much paler or brighter. This may be abundantly 

 verified in the minute Diptera and Campodea which frequent sunny 

 spots on the suows of late winter and early spring in the neighbor- 

 hood of Philadelphia, or by reference to a paper by Fitch ('51), 

 on the winter insects of New York, in which about twenty species 

 of Campodea, Neuroptera and Diptera are described, every one 

 of which is wholly or chiefly some shade of black. .Associated with 

 the " snow -worm " on the Malaspina Glacier was found a small 

 Podurian, Achorutes nivicola, also black; and in the neighborhood 

 of the glacier were collected a number of moths, flies and spiders, 

 which have been described respectively by Skinner, Johnson ('98) 

 and Banks ('98). So far as the colors of these have been noted, 

 they are confirmatory of the general fact stated above. 



It seems probable that the same causes which have stimulated 

 the formation of pigment in the Oligocholia also favor its production 

 in the Tracheata, and that some factor in a snowy environment lays 

 the brand of melanism upon all of the constituents of its inverte- 

 brate fauna. But an analysis of the physical and vital conditions 

 makes it evident that any one or several of five or six factors may 

 be the effective cause, and until some of these can be eliminated 

 by the conditions of experimentation it is almost idle to speculate. 

 Apparently the most important physiological result to the organ- 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 137 



ism of such a coat of pigment would be to place it in closer thermic 

 relations to its surrounding. By virtue of it the organism could 

 absorb a greater amount of radiant energy from an external source 

 of greater intensity, but it would also lose its internal heat more 

 rapidly to a cooler medium with which it was in contact. This 

 being the case, it seems impossible to apply Lord Walsingham's 

 {'85) hypothesis, valuable though it may be when applied to insects 

 alone, to our worm. Lord "Walsingham calls attention to the very 

 striking fact that while many warm-blooded animals become white 

 when subjected to Arctic conditions, the very opposite takes place 

 in insects. He points out that it is vitally necessary for a homo- 

 thermic animal to retain as much as possible of its internal heat 

 during cold weather. A white coat favors this. An insect, on 

 the contrary, having a variable temperature, becomes dormant 

 whenever the external temperature falls below the minimum for its 

 metabolic activity, but becomes more and more active with increas- 

 ing temperature. In Arctic climates the season of activity for 

 insects is very short. It is manifestly advantageous, therefore, 

 that during it, metabolism be as rapid as possible. Increased capac- 

 ity to absorb radiant energy would therefore be beneficial. 



Inasmuch as the snow-worm does not, according to Mr. Bryant's 

 account, expose itself to the sun's rays, it cannot benefit by its 

 capacity to absorb heat rays, except possibly during the short 

 period when it lives in the glacier pools. Even if they were to 

 come to the surface of the snow while the sun shone, it seems to me 

 that they could gain no appreciable amount of heat. The heat 

 absorbed would be immediately transferred to the surrounding snow, 

 which would melt, and the worm would simply tend to sink beneath 

 the surface. This would be the only change resulting from its 

 capacity to absorb heat rays. Zoological literature fairly bristles 

 with attempted explanations of melanism. Some are simplv 

 attempts to correlate melanism with certain factors of the physical 

 environment ; others are more or less ambitious essays to explain 

 the general fact or special cases. Without seeking to exhaust 

 the field, I have applied more than a dozen of them to the case of 

 this worm, without finding one that fits all of the conditions. 



The Oligochaeta are generally associated with warm, moist situa- 

 tions. We meet with them mostly during the spring and early sum- 

 mer months, while during the winter they retire from sight by 




138 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



burrowing into the earth below the frost line. Yet every one; 

 knows that after a warm rain in winter vast numbers of our com- 

 mon genera are often left dead on the surface of the ground to- 

 become the food of fowls, crows and other birds. A few warm 

 days will start earth-worms into conspicuous activity, and many 

 species retire beneath the surface only just so far as the actual 

 freezing of the soil compels them. Our common Enchytneidse are , 

 often found in clods of earth which are more or less completely 

 frozen, or in the interior of frozen logs amid crystals of ice. This 

 capacity of Oligochseta, and especially of the Enchytrseidse, to resist 

 cold is now well known. Zoological literature contains the follow- 

 ing cases: Leidy ('84) describes some small worms (which he 

 refers to Lumbriculus, but later ('85) describes as Lximbricus 

 gladalis, which is an Enchytrseid) found frozen in a block of ice 

 taken from a mill-pond in Delaware County, Pa. With them were 

 associated Rotifer vulgaris and some immature Anguillulse. Later 

 some similar worms were received in a block of ice harvested from 

 a pond near Moorestown, N. J., nearly a year before. This ice 

 was filled with air bubbles and water drops in which the worms 

 could be seen. On the ice being melted, the worms were liberated 

 in an active condition and moved about in the water, but died 

 as the latter became warmed. Dr. Leidy supposed that they were 

 not actually frozen while imprisoned in the ice. He describes them 

 under the name of Ltonbricus gladalis ('85). 



Kraus ('86) states that a small white worm was abundant m the 

 ice supplied to the town of Salina, Kans. , during the summer of 

 1885. As the ice melted they became somewhat active, but died 

 when the. temperature of the water reached 60° F. The same 

 species was found living in the mud at the bottom of stagnant 

 pools. Its presence in the ice is accounted for by the water 

 having frozen to the bottom in the ponds from which the ice had 

 been taken. 



Reecker ('96) found a living earthworm in natural ice on July 

 16. It was moving about in a cleft in the centre of a piece of ice. 

 The cleft communicated by a minute opening with the exterior. 

 He supposed that in February or March, during a thaw, the worm 

 had crawled between two blocks of ice which subsequently were 

 frozen together. This worm, which was identified as Lumbricus 

 rubellus, remained alive in the water until killed for preservation. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 139" 



Sekera ('96) observed specimens of earthworms of the species- 

 Dendrobana rubida Nj. (=Allolobophora boeckii Eisen) frozen in 

 blocks of ice in East Bohemia in December, 1886. When freed 

 from the ice they remained alive in the water for a week, when 

 they were preserved. This species is abundant in bottom lands 

 and along meadow brooks, and Sekera suggests that the worms 

 crawled out on the surface of the snow on a sunshiny winter's- 

 day, and were imprisoned by the formation of an icy crust after 

 nightfall. 



Probably most naturalists have met with similar cases illustra- 

 ting the cold-resisting power of earthworms. I add the following: 

 While at Woods Holl, Mass., in the summer of 1893, Mr. Joseph 

 Fay submitted to me for examination a large number of Enchy- 

 trseids taken from ice which had been cut during the previous 

 winter on his pond. Subsequently I received some of the ice con- 

 taining the living worms. This ice was porous and tilled with air 

 or marsh gas vesicles like that sent to Dr. Leidy from New Jersey. 

 The worms became active in the ice water, but died during the 

 course of two days, the temperature of the water having risen to 

 that of the air. This worm is probably identical with the Lum- 

 b rlcus glacialis of Leidy, and the " Lumbricoid " described by 

 Kraus ('86). It belongs to the genus Enchytrceus, but the species 

 is not stated in my notes, and the specimens are not just now avail- 

 able for examination. 



During the fall and winter of 1892-3, I kept a large number 

 of living annelids in my bedroom. Among these was an undeter- 

 mined species of IAmnodrilw, about thirty specimens of which 

 lived in a tumbler of water. During some of the coldest nights 

 of the winter, when the temperature outside descended nearly to 

 zero, this tumbler remained standing on the sill of a window 

 which was opened for ventilation. In the morning the contents 

 would be a solid lump of ice with a tangled mass of the worms em- 

 bedded in its centre. During the day the ice would thaw and by 

 evening the worms would be actively waving their posterior ends. 

 This alternate freezing and thawing was repeated many times 

 and on one occasion the tumbler was placed in the open air and its 

 contents kept frozen for a week At the close of the winter all 

 of the worms except three or four were still alive and normal. 



I know of no careful experiments on Oligochgeta to determine 




140 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



the minimum temperatures which can be resisted without loss of 

 life, but Roedel ('86) has recorded some experiments which he 

 made ou fresh- water leeches. Aulastomum gulo resisted a tempera- 

 ture of 2° C. for twelve to fifteen hours, and Clepsine eomplanata 

 a temperature of 5° C. for ninety minutes. The question whether 

 organisms can be actually frozen without consequent disorganiza- 

 tion and death has often been raised. It would seem that such 

 small, soft-bodied animals as leeches and Oligochaeta must inevi- 

 tably be frozen when subjected to the conditions described above, 

 and yet they were uninjured, but the experimental proof of this 

 is inconclusive. It is significant, however, that animals with 

 thick, non-conducting external coats, as insects, centipedes and 

 snails (Roedel, '86, and Pictet, '93) resist much lower tempera- 

 tures and for a longer time than soft-bodied animals. There is 

 little doubt that the protoplasm of vertebrate tissues will withstand 

 actual freezing and recover its activity upon being thawed. 

 Landois and Stirling ('91) state that frogs will recover after the 

 blood has been frozen and ice has formed in the peritoneal cavity; 

 and among Pictet' s remarkable experiments it is recorded that 

 the ciliated epithelium of the frog's mouth was subjected to the 

 extremely low temperature of — 90° C. for an entire day and night 

 and yet the cilia recovered their activity when the temperature had 

 been gradually raised above 0° C. 



The internal temperature of most of the lower invertebrates rises 

 generally less than a degree above the surrounding temperature 

 (Landois and Stirling, '91, p. 427). Metabolic activities diminish 

 with the lowering of the temperature and, in the animals (verte- 

 brates) which have been most studied, practically cease altogether 

 at the freezing point of water. 



Now this snow-worm lives and grows while maintaining a bodily 

 temperature which can seldom vary much from the freezing point 

 of water. According to Mr. Bryant, it lives during the summer in 

 the melting snow and the water derived therefrom which collects in 

 hollows and clefts on the ice. During the night, the period of its 

 activity, when it comes to the surface of the snow, the mean temper- 

 ature of the air is about 32° Fahr. When the sun shines the worms 

 descend into the melting snow — a veritable freezing medium, which 

 must keep their small bodies continually chilled to its own tem- 

 perature. An intimate temperature relation between the worm 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 141 



and its surroundings is further enhanced by its pigmented surface 

 which favors both radiation and absorption of heat. In being 

 thus adapted to a bodily temperature very near to that of the 

 minimum for protoplasmic activity, this worm resembles deep-sea. 

 animals. Semper has shown ('81) that it is the mean tempera- 

 ture, and not its fluctuations, which is important in determining 

 the rate of growth of an animal ; and here we have an organism 

 whose optimum temperature has probably been adjusted to a point 

 at which metabolism ceases in most other animals. Nothing is 

 known of the winter habits of the worm, but no doubt it burrows 

 deeply into the snow, and thus protected, lives in an environment 

 the temperature of which probably varies little from that of its 

 summer habitat at the surface. 



But little is known as yet of the geographical distribution of the 

 Enchytrreidse. They have been described from Europe, Asia, North 

 and South America, Greenland and New Zealand. But it is ouly 

 in Europe that our knowledge of the species and their distribution 

 is even approximately complete. From what is known of the 

 distribution of the Eurasian species the statement seems to be war- 

 ranted that this family reaches its greatest development in the 

 colder regions. Species abound in Siberia, NovaZembla, Denmark 

 and Norway, and some are found in Spitzbergen and Greenland, 

 where other Oligoclneta are very rare. Very few species have as 

 yet been described from the American continent, but, so far as our 

 information goes, it confirms the results of a study of the distribu- 

 tion of the Old World forms. The tropical and subtropical 

 forms appear to be few and small, while mauy have been described 

 by Michaelsen ('88 b ) and Ude ('96) from the southern extremity 

 of South America. They abound and present much variety in the 

 northern United States, though but comparatively few species have 

 been described. What is stated for the family seems to be preem- 

 inently true of the genus Mesenchytrceus. Of the eleven species 

 recorded for Eurasia, none have been reported south of Germany, 

 where Michaelsen ('89) has fouud and described three species; three 

 species are also found each in Siberia (Eisen, '79), Nova Zembla 

 (Eisen, '79, and Levinsen, '83) and Denmark (Levinsen, '83). 

 None have been reported from North America, but two species, one 

 of which is probably 31. beaumeri Mich., and the other unde- 

 scribed, occur in the neighborhood of Philadelphia. Ude men- 




142 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



tions no Mesenchytrceus from South America ia his recent exhaus- 

 tive paper ('96). It is perhaps not so surprising that a member 

 of this seemingly almost Arctic genus should be found amid the 

 snow and ice of a northern glacier. Most of the Arctic species 

 collected by Nordenskjold and described by Eisen were found in 

 moss or under stones. The only mention 3 which I find in the litera- 

 ture of a similar habitat of an Oligochaete is the following brief 

 passage in Nordenskjold' s Gronland ('86, p. 193): "With the 

 •exception of a few birds (seen) on the return trip the only animal 

 observed was a worm living on the different species of ice algre 

 and therefore probably belonging to the fauna of the inland ice." 

 This worm has not been described, and if really an Oligochsete, 

 may be identical with Mesenchytrceus solifugus.

3 The " snow- worms " have been reported by previous explorers of the gla- 

 ciers of Alaska ; by Prof. Wright ('87), from the Muir Glacier, and Prof. 

 Russell, from the Malaspina Glacier. Prof. Wright has kindly sent me some 

 examples collected by him from shallow pools of water on the ice sheet. 

 They prove to represent both M. solifugus and M. nivus. Prof. Russell 

 ('92) fully confirms Mr. Bryant's account of their habits in the following 

 passage : "In the early morning before the sunlight touched the snow its 

 surface was literally covered with small, slim, black worms, about an inch 

 long, .... These creatures were wriggling on the snow in thousands, but 

 as the sun rose and made its warmth felt they disappeared beneath the sur- 

 face. They are not seen when the temperature is above freezing." In a 

 letter Prof. Russell adds the interesting information that he has observed 

 similar worms on the snows of Mt. Rainier, Wash., thus indicating for them 

 a wide distribution. Arctic and Alpine explorers should be on the watch 

 for them.

DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW SPECIES OF TURBONILLA OF THE WESTERN 



ATLANTIC FAUNA, WITH NOTES ON THOSE 



PREVIOUSLY KNOWN. 



BY KATHARINE JEANNETTE BUSH. 



The present article is based on a small, but very interesting, 

 collection of gastropods belonging to the genus Turbonilla, which, 

 through the courtesy of Mr. Pilsbry, was recently loaned to the 

 writer for study. 



With few exceptions the specimens had been labelled as known 

 southern species and in a few instances had been figured in Try on' s 

 Manual, but a careful comparison with the original descriptions 

 and figures showed that these names were incorrectly applied. 

 Most of the species are now described and figured as new. That 

 so many personal names have been adopted for them is, to a great 

 extent, due to the almost overwhelming confusion existing in 

 the names of the hundreds of already described Hying species (ttill 

 more increased among fossil forms), by their duplication and, in some 

 instances, reduplication, especially due to the lax usage of some au- 

 thors in respect to the two genera, Turbonilla and Odostomia. 1 



During the past few months the writer, jointly with Prof. A. E. 

 Verrill, has arranged and studied the many hundreds of specimens 

 belonging to these genera, dredged by the U. S. Fish Commission 

 from 1871-1887, and also those in the Yale University Museum. 

 The larger part of them represent unknown forms, fine figures of 

 which have been prepared, and, as soon as practicable, will be 

 published with their descriptions. 



The acknowledgments of the writer are here expressed to Mr. 

 Pilsbry for the privilege of publishing the following descriptions, 

 and especially to Prof. Verrill, to whose generosity the drawings 

 for the accompanying plates are wholly due.

TURBONILLA. 



Risso, 1S20 (sensu extenso). 



The genus Turbonilla is here taken in its most extended sense to 

 include all species having a more or less elongated form, consisting 

 of few or many planulate or more or less convex, sometimes shoul- 

 dered, whorls, always ornamented with more or less prominent, 

 transverse ribs, and always having a reversed, flattened or project- 

 ing nucleus consisting of about 1^ to 3 whorls, tilted from trans- 

 verse to the axis to more or less oblique. Intercostal spaces smooth 

 or crossed by more or less distinct, incised, sometimes raised, spiral 

 lines which often also appear on the base, which varies from short, 

 little rounded (the body-whorl subangulated at the periphery), to 

 elongate and well-rounded. Aperture varying from subquadrate 

 with straight pillar-lip, to elongate -ovate, well-rounded and pro- 

 duced below, with curved pillar-lip. Peritreme generally discon- 

 tinuous, rarely continuous; inner lip more or less thickened and 

 reflected, usually with a plication or fold, often invisible exter- 

 nally; outer- lip almost always thin, seldom thickened. 



Iu its most restricted sense the genus was proposed by Risso, 

 1826, from Leach's manuscript, for Turbo lacteus Liune, as the 

 type, of which Helix elegantmima Montagu is now considered a 

 synonym. This species has an elongated form; an obliquely tilted 

 nucleus of about li flattened whorls ; well developed transverse 

 ribs ending at the periphery of the body-whorl, with smooth, 

 intercostal spaces; base smooth; aperture somewhat elongated; 

 pillar-lip straight, thickened and reflected. 



Many species have, however, come to light which not only possess 

 these characters in a more or less marked degree, but have others in 

 addition. This has rendered it necessary to introduce new limits for 

 the genus. Many additional names have been proposed by various 

 authors (Carpenter, 1855-7; Monterosato, 1884;Sacco, 1892, and 

 others) for these new divisions, which need much careful study and 




148 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



will be further discussed in the article ou the genus now in course 



of preparation. 



Turbonilla interrupta (Totten) H. and A. Adams. 



Turritella interrupta Totten. Airier. Jour. Sci., xxviii, p. 352, fig. 7, 

 1835. 



This very much misinterpreted species was described by Totten, 

 as follows : 



" Shell small, subulate, brownish; volutions about ten, almost 

 flat, with about twenty-two transverse, obtuse ribs, separated by 

 grooves of equal diameter, and with about fourteen subequal, 

 impressed, revolving lines, which are arranged in pairs, and 

 entirely interrupted by the ribs; below the middle of the body- 

 whorl, the ribs become obsolete, and the revolving lines continu- 

 ous; aperture ovate, angular above, regularly rounded below, 

 about one-fifth the length of the shell; right lip, sharp, indis- 

 tinctly sinuous; length, .22 of an inch; breadth, .07." 



Dredged in Newport, R. I , harbor. 



The number of specimens is not given, but, as the description is 

 so clearly defined, it is safe to assume that there was only the 

 figured one. My efforts to find whether or not it is still in exist- 

 tence have been unsuccessful. 



The specimens found in Dartmouth harbor, Mass. , and identified 

 as this species by Prof. C. B. Adams, are still in the cabinet at 

 Amherst College, where I have recently examined them and found 

 that none agree with the original descriptions or figure. Adams 2 

 mentions that he identified them by the description, but calls 

 attention to the great variation among them, as follows: 



" The number of transverse ribs is seldom less than twenty-five, 

 and often exceeds thirty. Above the body-whorl, the number of 

 revolving lines does not exceed eight. The arrangement of them 

 in pairs does not distinctly appear in these specimens." 



These facts have been overlooked by more recent authors and 

 these specimens have always been recorded, as the second authentic 

 specimens to have been found. They really represent four (4) 

 distinct species. One specimen (a) has the form of T. areolata 

 Verrill, but the five (5) spiral lines are not so evenly spaced as 

 in that species. Three specimens (6) have the general form of Tot- 

 ten' s figure, but there are only five (5) nearly equally spaced,

coarse, spiral lines on the intercostal spaces; they are examples of 

 an undescribed species or possibly a variety of T. elegans Verrill. 

 Two specimens (c), one badly worn and one young, have the 

 whorls slightly more convex, with seven (7) equally separated, 

 coarse, incised lines between the ribs, and agree with U. S. F. C. 

 specimens of an undescribed species found abundantly in Vine- 

 yard Sound. One specimen (c?), badly worn, is like another 

 undescribed U. S. F. C. species, a comparatively few specimens of 

 which have also been found in Vineyard .Sound. The spirals are 

 of unequal size and are arranged in two wide, deep, but little 

 separated grooves, just above the suture; a group of three similar 

 grooves, a little above the middle of the whorls, above and below 

 which are about seven fine, incised lines, sometimes a few finer 

 ones appear, so that there are in all from twenty to twenty -two 

 lines. An example with about 10 whorls is over 7 mm. long and 2 

 mm. in diameter. 



An example of this species, labelled T. irderrupta, thought to 

 have been identified by Stimpson, has been sent to me by Dr. Dall. 

 Several very poor ones (Xos. 79,008 and 68,426) found at Sea 

 Isle City, X. J., were also received from Philadelphia. 



Gould, in his first report on the Invertebrates of Massachusetts 

 (1841, p. 268), redescribes and figures the species, but evidently 

 did not have access to the type, as the figure is very unlike 

 Totten's, and the ribs and spirals are given as follows : 



" From twenty-five to thirty straight, blunt ribs crossed by about 

 fourteen revolving lines which are interrupted by the ribs ; these 

 lines are arranged in pairs, but so close to each other as not always 

 to be distinguished, and would usually be regarded as one." 



Prof. John M. Clarke has recently very courteously consulted 

 the records of the State Museum, Albany, X. Y. , and failed to 

 find such a species in the Gould collection, so that the above 

 remarks probably applied to Adams' specimens. 



Stimpson, 1851, records additional examples which he found 

 in Boston harbor. 



As the locality of the type was Newport, R. I., harbor, it is 

 safe to assume that the species could also be found in the near 

 vicinity, at Narragansett bay; but none of the southern specimens 

 in this collection, identified as interrupter are at all like any form 

 found by the U. S. F. C. in that locality. Figures and descrip- 




150 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



tions of these northern species will soon be published so that the 

 true interrupta may be clearly understood. 



All of these forms are distiuct from T. rufa Philippi, specimens 

 of which, collected in 8-10 fathoms, Church Bay, Ireland, have 

 recently been received from Mr. Chaster, of Southport, England. 

 In these, there are but five, unevenly spaced, incised, spiral lines 

 on the intercostal spaces and three or four, finer ones on the base. 

 In specimens from the same locality, of the smaller, distinct species, 

 T. fulvocincta Thompson, the intercostal spaces have a wide, unin- 

 terrupted portion next the suture, below which there are six incised 

 lines, varying in size in different specimens, and five, distinct ones 

 on the base. An example with 9 whorls is 6^ mm. long. Two 

 specimens from off Cape Hatteras, N. C, labelled as var. fulvo- 

 cinda Jeffreys, sent me by Dr. Dall, differ decidedly from these. 

 Both have 9 whorls, but differ in length, one measuring 5, the 

 other 5^ mm. The intercostal spaces are cut by unequal spiral 

 lines, varying in number ; six or seven, wide and deep ones below, 

 and six or twelve finer ones above, the upper ones scarcely 

 visible. 



In 1866, Mr. Krebs, of St, Thomas, W. L, visited Amherst 

 College, and afterwards published " Remarks on the C. B. Adams* 

 Collection," in the Annals of New York Lyceum, viii, p. 395, 1866. 



Those relating to the species of Chemnitzia are as follows: 



" Chemnitzia exilis, C. flavocincta, C. kevis and C. subulata are 

 very like each other. 



"Chemnitzia multicostata and C. substriata, when a sufficient 

 number of specimens are at hand, may prove to be synonyms. 



" Chemnitzia obeliscus is described from three fragments of differ- 

 ent individuals and C. puncta from two miserable specimens. 



" One species from Jamaica, seven from St. Thomas and three 

 from "West Indies are without names. ' ' 



These show that Adams' specimens must either have been very 

 poor or that the collection, as suggested by Morch, 1875, had been 

 disarranged when Mr. Krebs made these notes. It certainly is a 

 little peculiar that such different species so carefully described by 

 Adams should be so grouped. It is very unfortunate that only 

 the empty trays are now to be found in the cabinet, the specimens 

 themselves having been taken from the cases and not returned. It 

 is owing to these facts that the present collection is of peculiar 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 151 



importance, as it contains the specimens figured in Tryon's Manual 



as Adams' species. 



Turbonilla Pilsbryi, new species. Plate VIII, fig. 9. 



Shell of good size for the genus, stout, pure opaque white, in 

 some places semitransparent, lustrous, regularly coiled, with the 

 entire surface, except the nucleus and ribs, covered by numerous, 

 unequal, spiral grooves, so crowded that the spaces between them 

 appear like fine, uneven threads. Whorls swollen, indistinctly 

 bevelled on the top, 6 below the promiueut, oblique, flattened 

 nucleus. Suture distinct. Transverse ribs about 26, very deli- 

 cate, scarcely more than little raised lines, slightly oblique, the 

 inclination toward the aperture (to the right), separated by wide, 

 shallow spaces. Body-whorl elongated, well-rounded, with the 

 ribs extending well over the base, gradually decreasing in size to 

 the inner-lip. Aperture oblique-ovate with continuous peritreme ; 

 inner-lip represented by a thin glaze; columella having an obscure, 

 median, toothlike swelling; outer-lip thickened within, with well- 

 rounded edge. 



Length, about 4h mm.; diameter, about 1^ mm.; length of 

 aperture, about 1 mm. 



One specimen (No. 72,045) found at St. Thomas, "W. I , by R. 

 Swift. 



This very beautiful species was labelled as T. Riisei Morch, 

 which was originally described by Morch (Syn. Moll. Mar. Ind. 

 Occid., p. 165, 1875) as having the form of Rmoina Catesbyana, 

 d'Orbigny (Hist. Vile de Cuba, atlas, PI. XTI, figs. 1, 2). The 

 type from St. Thomas, \V. I., collected by Riise, was club- 

 shaped, thick, deep yellow, white at the suture, with two darker 

 bands, the superior one near the suture and the other median, with 

 very delicate spiral strire. Costa? numerous, about 40, continuous 

 to the aperture, which is ovate with a continuous thickened peri- 

 treme, with a thickened white lip and an indistinct columellar 

 fold. Length, B% mm. ; diameter, 1^ mm. 



The figure given by Tryon (Manual, PI. 76, fig. 27), although 

 said to be figured from the type, represents a species very different 

 from either form. 

 Turbonilla asperula, new species. 



Shell small, slender, golden brown, with slight lustre, consisting 

 of 6 moderately convex, somewhat shouldered whorls below the 




152 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



prominent oblique nucleus of but little over one whorl. Trans- 

 verse ribs 26, slender, prominent, oblique (inclined to the right), 

 with a decided angle at the shoulder of the whorls, and extending 

 over the periphery of the body-whorl, gradually decreasing in size 

 on the base. Interspaces wide and deep, crossed on the last whorl 

 by 5 (sometimes 6) about equal and evenly spaced, raised, rounded, 

 spiral lines, the first just at or a little below the shoulder, and the 

 last just at the periphery; under the microscope they appear to 

 render the sides of the ribs very irregular and the alternating 

 spaces are crossed by scarcely discernible stride. Base elougate, 

 ornamented between the ribs by 4 more prominent, widely sepa- 

 rated, raised, spiral lines, below which there are ill-defined fine 

 ones ; aperture ovate ; peritreme continuous. 



Length of the largest specimeu, 3 mm.; diameter, 1 mm.; 

 length of aperture, about -f mm. 



Five specimens of this very distinct species were found at Ber- 

 muda by Prof. Yerrill and party, 1898.

 poda and Gasteropoda, xv, p. 493, Pi. XXXII, fig. 7, 1885. 



A single specimen (No. 72,056) in the R. Swift collection, with- 

 out locality, was labelled as this species, but is too poor to identify 

 with certainty. It has 7 flattened, regularly increasing whorls 

 below the apparently blunt, little raised, tilted nucleus, and in 

 form and size agrees with d'Orbigny's figure. 



The 24 straight, prominent, transverse ribs are perpendicular on 

 the upper whorls and oblique (inclined to the left) on the lower 

 ones and extend over the base, gradually decreasing in size. 

 These are separated by wider, deep spaces which, under the micro- 

 scope, appear much deeper near the suture than below, giving a 

 constricted appearance to the whorls without affecting the ribs. 

 Base elongated, rounded, ornamented between the ribs, except on 

 the lowest portion, by about 7 raised, spiral threads separated by 

 nearly uniform, deep spaces. Such lines are represented in d'Orbig- 

 ny's figure, but none are mentioned in his description. The specimen 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 153 



is so worn and encrusled that other spiral sculpture, if present, can- 

 not be determined. Under the microscope the whorls are seen to be 

 well-lapped with a rounded undulating edge turning well out at 

 the deep suture. The aperture is broken. 



Two other specimens (Xo. 72,048), also of the R. Swift collec- 

 tion, were labelled T. fiavocincta C. B. Adams, but the figure given 

 in Tryon's Manual, as made from a specimen, does not represent 

 either of them. These differ in some respects from the above 

 example, but agree with others fuiind at Bermuda by Prof. A. E. 

 Verrill and party in 1898. Among these, which number over 40, 

 there is considerable variation. The nucleus is usually but little 

 raised, but sometimes is cpiite prominent and oblique; the number 

 of lines on the base varies from 7-10, with finer ones below; the 

 number of ribs varies from 22-20, sometimes 30 or more when 

 the specimen has been injured; they are usually straight, some- 

 time* slightly curved, usually perpendicular, sometimes oblique. 

 Some specimens have on the upper portion of the intercostal 

 spaces, two well-separated, inconspicuous grooves, and on fresh 

 examples which are yellow-white, semitransparent and lustrous 

 with bands of waxen color at the sutures and on the periphery of 

 the body-whorl exceedingly fine stria? appear under the micro- 

 scope. The aperture is ovate, lustrous within, when fresh, with 

 continuous peritreme, the inner-lip represented by a thin layer of 

 enamel having a delicate free edge. The shell increases regularly 

 in diameter to the 6th or 7th whorl, and beyond the increase is 

 more gradual. 



Length of a 7-whorled specimen, 31 mm. ; diameter, 1 mm.; 

 length of aperture, about 1 mm. 



A worn dead specimen dredged by the "Challenger'' in 390 

 fathoms off Culebra, W. I., was described and figured by Watson 

 as Odostomia phrikalea. It agrees so closely with the above ex- 

 amples that there is little doubt of its being the same species. 

 Turbonilla pupoides variety isclma, new. 



Four specimens (Xo. 79,014) differ from the typical form, in 

 being much more slender. After the 4th or 5th whorl the increase 

 in diameter is so gradual that the sides of the spire appear nearly 

 parallel. Specimens 4 mm. in length, being of the same diame- 

 ter as others of but about half that length. Over a dozen of this 

 form were among the Bermuda specimens.

 Turban ill, i textilis Tryori, Amer. Mar. Conch., p. 65, 1873 ; Manual, viii, 

 p. 329, pi. 75, fig. 12 (variety), 1885. 



Shell small, rather stout, bluntly tapered, white, semitranspar- 

 ent, of dull lustre, with swollen whorls bevelled above, just below 

 the suture, forming a rounded shoulder and having a few, coarse,, 

 spiral grooves on the interspaces and a few, raised, spiral threads oni 

 the base. Suture linear. Whorls 6 below the good-sized, oblique, 

 flattened nucleus. Transverse ribs, which extend a little below the 

 periphery of the body- whorl, are 26, narrow, rounded, prominent,, 

 perpendicular, but a very little inclined to the right on the last 

 whorl, their sides rendered uneven by the cutting in of the spiral 

 grooves, separated by wider, deep spaces, which are crossed by 5 

 wide, deep, spiral, grooves of about equal size and evenly separated, 

 the top one just at the shoulder of the whorls. Base elongated, 

 rounded, cut by two equally wide, Avell separated, deep, spiral 

 grooves, interrupted by the ribs which here disappear; below, 

 there are four or five, raised, spiral threads separated by shallow 

 grooves. Aperture very smooth and lustrous within, elongate- 

 ovate with the pillar-lip thin and reflected, especially below. 



Length, 3A mm. ; diameter, 1 \ mm. ; length of aperture, 1 

 mm. 



Two live specimens (No. 72,051) found in two fathoms at 

 Marco, Fla. , by Mr. H. Hemphill. A badly worn young speci- 

 men from Station 2,114, off Cape Hatteras, N. C, in fourteen 

 fathoms, dredged by the U. S. F. C. in 1883, agrees closely with 

 these, but is too poor to identify with certainty. The same is true 

 of an example from Bermuda. 



They are easily recognized by the distinctly shouldered whorls 

 and coarse spiral grooves, and may be examples of the true textilis 

 of Kurtz. " Whorls shouldered " is the only feature given in the 

 original description which separates that species from many others. 



Two small, live specimens (Xo. 72,043) in the R. Swift collec- 

 tion were collected by Stimpson on the coast of South Carolina and 

 were labelled as T. textilis Kurtz, and figured by Tryon. Both 

 have the apex somewhat eroded and the body-whorl has been in- 

 jured and repaired. They are more slender than the typical form 

 (No. 72,051). The larger has 6 moderately swollen, not distinctly 

 shouldered whorls, below the rather prominent, oblique, flattened 




18t>y.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 155- 



nucleus. Suture well impressed. Transverse ribs about 20, nar- 

 row, rounded, perpendicular, separated by wider, shallow spacer 

 which are crossed by 5, wide, deep, spiral grooves. Body- whorl 

 slightly angulated at the periphery, rounded and elongated below, 

 crossed by two, wide grooves, interrupted by the ribs, and below by 

 four or five, rather indistinct, raised, spiral threads and wider 

 grooves. 



Length, 3 mm.; diameter, 1 mm; length of aperture, 4 mm. 



As the well impressed suture gives only a well-rounded summit, 

 and not a distinct shoulder, to the whorls, these specimens cannot 

 be examples of the true textilis, but are doubtless a variety of No. 

 72,051, from which they differ in having flatter whorls, more 

 tapered apex and little rounded base. The form of the aperture 

 in the variety is somewhat angular, expanded below with the 

 columellar-lip straighter, thin and reflected, forming an angle at 

 its juncture with the outer-lip.

A few specimens (12) from Bermuda differ from forms of 

 pupoides in the greater size and prominence of the very oblique 

 nucleus and in the much shortened, little rounded base over which 

 the transverse ribs do not extend, but become evanescent near the 

 abruptly rounded periphery of the body-whorl. The aperture in 

 all of them is badly broken. The peritreme does not appear to 

 be continuous and the pillar-lip is reflected and considerably thick- 

 ened, especially below. On some, there are slight indications of 

 spiral lines on the intercostal spaces. Baised, rounded, spiral 

 threads ornament the base.

 measures 5 mm. , but in the text the size of the species is given as- 

 3 mm.

Turbonilla Stimpsoni, new species. Plate VIII, fig. 7. 



Shell pure white, slender, with elongated whorls, causing the apex 

 to appear very pointed. Whorls flattened, 9, besides the elongated, 

 smooth, shining, prominent, slightly oblique, flattened nucleus. 

 Suture deep, forming distinct notches in the otherwise straight 

 outlines of the spire, scalloped by the ends of the numerous ribs. 

 These are about 36, narrow, rounded, very oblique (inclined to 

 right), separated by much narrower, rather deep spaces which are 

 crossed by nearly equal, but irregularly spaced, incised lines which 

 form deep pittings. Under a half-inch pocket lens 9 can be 

 counted which increase to 10 or 11 under the microscope, and are 

 seen to cut into the sides of the ribs. On the base the ribs merge 

 into prominent lines of growth which are cut by four widely 

 separated, conspicuous, revolving lines, with a few very fine ones 

 below. Base well-rounded. Aperture elongate-ovate, with the 

 pillar-lip curved and moderately thickened. 



Length, 5§ mm. ; diameter, 1 mm. ; length of aperture, 1 mm. 



One specimen (No. 72,042) in the R. Swift collection was found 

 by William Stimpson on the Carolina coast, and was labelled as T. 

 interrupta (Totten). It is very unlike all the known northern 

 forms. The T. ornata d'Orbigny, 1853, not Gould, 1861, has 

 ribs which extend over the base, but according to d'Orbigny' s 

 figure, they are coarser, fewer in number and perpendicular; the 

 whorls are more convex, the spire less acute and the spirals more 

 numerous (Hist. Pile de Cuba, i, p. 221, atlas, PI. XVI, figs. 

 18-20). 



Turbonilla incisa, new species. Plate VIII, fig. 12. 



Shell of medium size, moderately stout, white, semitransparent 

 and lustrous, when fresh, with coarse, spiral, incised lines in the 

 intercostal spaces and on the base. Suture well marked. Whorls 

 flattened, 9 below the rather prominent, slightly oblique, flattened 

 nucleus. Transverse ribs 20, broad, bluntly rounded, straight, 

 perpendicular, with wider, shallow interspaces crossed by 7, rarely 

 6, coarse, unequal, incised, spiral lines or grooves, about evenly 

 separated. In one example having 6 lines, the last, just above 

 the suture, is very much broader and deeper than the others. 

 Base well-rounded, cut by about 7, evenly spaced, incised, spiral 

 lines. Aperture somewhat elongated; pillar-lip straight, thin, 

 slightly reflected.

Three specimens (No. 62,800) from West Florida were pre- 

 sented by Mr. C. W. Johnson, 1891. 



The more slender Turbonilla virga Dall is a closely related 

 species In a specimen sent to me by Dr. Dall, the 10 flattened 

 whorls (nucleus wanting) are much more gradually tapered so that 

 it is but about onedialf as wide as an example of incisa of the same 

 length and the 7 incised lines are equal, and under the microscope 

 appear to cut into the sides of the transverse ribs. 

 Turbonilla incisa variety constricta. new. 



Two specimens (So. 79,023) from the same locality are of mod- 

 erate size, slender, irregularly coiled (abruptly contracted in the 

 6th and 7th whorls), semitransparent, pale yellow (when fresh), 

 with a broad band of brown on the base, and a fainter one at the 

 suture. Upper whorls moderately convex, lower ones flattened. 

 Suture well marked. Whorls 10 below the prominent, oblique, 

 flattened nucleus. Transverse ribs irregularly developed, thin, 

 narrow, but little raised, separated by wide, shallow spaces. On 

 the oth whorl, the interspaces are wide, but become much nar- 

 rower on the 6th whorl with more delicate and more numerous ribs, 

 while on the 8th whorl they again become wider, with much 

 stronger ribs; and on the last whorl the ribs number about 26. 

 Base well-rounded, cut by about 7 fine, incised, unevenly sep- 

 arated, spiral lines, the upper one the most distinct. Aper- 

 ture ovate ; pillar-lip thin, well reflected. The spirals on the 

 upper whorls are arranged as in typical incisa, but on the lower 

 ones, in the larger specimen, they number 7, but are of equal 

 size, and evenly spaced; under the microscope 2 or 3 finer ones 

 appear below the suture, and on the middle of the whorls; also on 

 the lower portion of the base, numerous, still finer ones. When 

 young, this variety could not be separated from the typical exam- 

 ples, but the peculiarity in its development, seen even in one with 

 7 whorls easily distinguishes it, at least as a variety.

Shell of good size, amber-colored, semitransparent, lustrous. 

 Apex broken, remaining whorls 8 ; the upper ones are somewhat 

 eroded, but the last one is well-rounded. Transverse ribs 22, 

 rounded, straight, nearly perpendicular, separated by about 

 equally wide shallow spaces which are crossed by 5 equal, well- 

 separated, incised, spiral lines, and 2 (the 1st and 5th) very much 

 finer ones. Base well-rounded, cut by 6 distinct, widely, unevenly 

 spaced, incised, spiral lines. Aperture elongated; pillar-lip 

 straight, thickened, slightly reflected below. 



Length, 6 mm. ; diameter, li mm. ; length of aperture, 1^

One specimen (No. 60,125) off Micco, Indian river, Fla. , in 

 two fathoms, mud. This is considerably larger than any of the 

 northern examples of elegans Verrill, but so closely agrees with 

 them in form that with a sufficient series it may prove to be a 

 southern variety. 



As the Chemnitzia elegans d'Orbigny (1853) is not a Turbonilla 

 (in its peculiar thickened base, at which the transverse ribs termi- 

 nate abruptly, it shows its close relation to Cerithium turrita Stearns 

 from Florida), and Odostomia elegans A. Adams (1860) is spirally 

 ornamented, and 0. elegans Monterosato (1869) is smooth, Prof. 

 VerrilPs name need not be changed. 



Turbonilla sp. ? 



A young specimen (No. 79,006) from off" Micco, Indian river, 

 Fla., is amber-colored, semitransparent and lustrous, rather stout, 

 with distinct suture. The upper portion is wanting, the 6 remain- 

 ing, somewhat flattened whorls are crossed by about 24, narrow, 

 low, slightly oblique ribs inclined to the right, separated by wider, 

 shallow spaces. These are crossed by about 8 (6 about equal and 

 2 more indistinct) unequal and unevenly spaced, incised, spiral 

 lines. Base well-rounded, cut by numerous (about 15) fine, 

 wavy, incised, spiral lines. Aperture ovate; pillar-lip curved, 

 thin, slightly reflected. 



Length, 3i mm. ; diameter, 1^ mm. ; length of aperture, 1 mm. 

 With a sufficient series, this might prove to be the same as a similar 

 vundescribed species common in Vineyard Sound and vicinity.

Another young, imperfect specimen (No. 79,007) from the same 

 locality has only the 6 lower whorls, the last one crossed by about 

 20 transverse ribs which are rounded, straight, and perpendicular, 

 separated by about equally wide, shallow spaces which are cut by 

 about 6 unequal, incised, spiral lines which increase to 10 under 

 the microscope. Base well- rounded, cut by about 10 fine, incised, 

 unevenly spaced,, spiral lines. Aperture elongated; inner-lip 

 straight, thin and reflected. 



Length, 4|- mm. ; diameter, lh mm. ; length of aperture, about

Turbonilla Conradi, new specie?. Plate VIII, fig. 10. 



Shell large, regularly coiled, stout, dirty waxen gray, ornamented 

 with coarse and fine, incised, spiral fines on the intercostal spaces 

 and base. Whorls 12, slightly convex, below the prominent, 

 nearly flattened nucleus, transverse to the axis. Suture well 

 marked, slightly undulating. Transverse ribs, about 22, broad, 

 rounded, straight, slightly oblique, separated by wider, shallow 

 spaces crossed by 4 conspicuous, incised lines, and several indistinct, 

 finer ones. One just above the suture forms a wide and deep 

 groove, another similar one at the middle of the whorls, on either 

 side and well separated from this, a distinct line, the three forming 

 a conspicuous band ; above and below this there are other indistinct 

 lines which, under the microscope, number 6 on each space; 2 

 others also appear on each side of the median groove. Base well- 

 rounded, cut by 3 distinct, well-separated, incised, spiral lines and 

 several finer ones below. Aperture squarish, well-rounded; pillar- 

 lip straight, thickened, well reflected.

 concave interspaces, which are crossed by unequal, incised lines. 

 Under a half-inch pocket lens there are two nearthe suture and two 

 above the periphery which form pairs of deep grooves of unequal 

 width; besides these the surface is scratched by numerous, fine, 

 unequal and irregularly spaced Hues; 8 between the two sets of 

 grooves ; still finer ones above, on the upper portion of the whorl 

 and 1 between the two lowest grooves. Under the microscope, a 

 few more lines appear. Base rounded, crossed only by numerous 

 fine, nearly equal, incised, revolving lines. Aperture somewhat 

 elongate; outer-lip broken. 



Length, 9h mm; diameter, 2i mm. ; length of aperture, about 

 2 mm. 



One specimen (No. 70,535) collected by Dr. William R. Rush, 

 at Maldonado Bay, in 3-6 fathoms, Uruguay, was labelled as T. 

 interrupta Totten. In form it is nearest the T. viridaria Dall, 

 with specimens of which it has been compared, but the number 

 and arrangement of the spiral sculpture easily distinguish it. It 

 is very distiuct from T. dispar Pilsbry, 3 from the same locality, 

 which has 8, somewhat convex whorls below the somewhat flat- 

 tened nucleus, transverse to the axis, with ill-defined transverse 

 ribs, the interspaces crossed by 6 unevenly separated, spiral grooves 

 which form oblong punctures. 



This is a similar but much larger species than T. areolata Verrill, 

 1874, not Rayneval. 

 Turbonilla pyrrha, new species. Plate VIII, fig. L 



Shell of moderate size, regularly coiled, delicate yellow (when 

 fresh), thin, semitransparent, the interspaces and base cut by a 

 few, unevenly separated, incised, spiral lines. There are ten 

 slightly convex whorls below the prominent, shining, slightly 

 oblique, flattened nucleus. Suture moderately deep. Transverse 

 ribs about 40, very delicate, but little raised, perpendicular, sepa-

rated by wider, shallower spaces which are crossed by comparatively, 

 few, incised, irregularly spaced lines, and also by a wide, deep, su- 

 tural groove, often stained by oxide of iron. Well separated from the 

 groove, there is a group of from 5-7 equal and evenly spaced lines 

 and a considerable distance above are. 4 or 5 somewhat wider, un- 

 evenly, but well-separated lines. Base well-rounded, cut by about 

 7 conspicuous, incised spirals, about evenly spaced. Aperture 

 somewhat elongated, well-rounded; pillar-lip straight, thin, re- 

 flected. 



Length of the largest example, 6 mm. ; diameter, li mm. ; 

 length of aperture, 1A. 



Three specimens (No. 72,050) from St. Thomas, W. I., and two 

 worn specimens (No. 79,020) without locality. Some of them 

 were labelled as T. subulata C. B. Adams, 1850 (not Holmes, 

 1860) and figured by Tryon. That species was described as 

 " much elongated, subulate, white, or pale brownish white with 

 two spiral bands of pale wax color and a third of the same color 

 anteriorly. Spire with a slightly curved axis, outline scarcely 

 convex; whorls ten, beside the moderately oblique nucleus; rather 

 convex with suture well impressed. Transverse ribs, 28—30, 

 prominent, slender, extending below the convexity of the body- 

 whorl ; the interspaces and base crossed by numerous, exceedingly 

 fine crowded spiral stride, of which one next below the suture is 

 larger. Aperture ovate, acute above, labrum slightly thickened. 

 L., .17; B., .045 inches." 



Two smaller specimens (No. 79,017) having only 9 whorls differ 

 from the typical ones in having 42 ribs, two wide, deep grooves on 

 the interspaces, one at the suture and one above the middle of the 

 whorls, between which, and equally well separated from them, a 

 group of 7, equal and evenly spaced, incised lines; above, near the 

 suture, are also two incised lines. These are designated as variety 

 a. A badly worn specimen (No. 79,021), without locality, also 

 has 42 delicate ribs. 



Three, opaque white, w T eather-worn specimens (No. 72,053) 



were labelled T. puncta C. B. Adams, and figured by Tryon. In 



outline they agree with specimens (No. 72,050), but they have 



but 30 transverse ribs, with the shallow interspaces crossed by a 



sutural groove and well separated from it, a group of 5, equal and 



evenly spaced, incised lines, and a considerable distance above,

.reaching to the suture, 4 evenly spaced ones, the lower one some- 

 times a little larger than the others. These are designated as 

 variety b. 



Length of the largest, 5i mm. ; diameter, 1 mm. 



Another example (No. 72,054), without locality, was labelled as 

 T. turri$ d'Orbigny, which is described as a very elegant, elon- 

 gated, very acute, thin, white species of 14 somewhat flattened 

 whorls. Transverse ribs (according to the figure) about 24, nar- 

 row, perpendicular, with spiral lines only on the base. Suture 

 impressed. Aperture subtrapezoidal ; labrum thin, columellar-lip 

 thickened, straight. 



Four specimens (No. 79,018) have more elongated whorls than 

 the typical examples (Xo. 72,050), so that specimens of the same 

 number of whorls are a little longer. The transverse ribs number 

 but 28 in the largest specimen, in the others, 30. The interspaces 

 are crossed by a sutural groove, above and well separated from it, 

 a group of 5 incised lines; some distance above, a single more 

 distinct line and at an equal distance above, a group of 3 finer 

 ones which reach to the suture. This is called variety c. A single 

 specimen (Xo. 79,022), without locality, differs in lmving the sin- 

 gle line above the periphery as wide and deep as the sutural groove. 



Three specimens (Xo. 79,019) have but 32 ribs and 2 spiral 

 grooves as in variety a, but the lower group of incised lines num- 

 bers from 7-9, and the upper, 5. This is variety d.

G. B. Adams described this as a much elongated, white species of 

 rectilinear outline with 10 or 11, besides the nucleus, scarcely 

 convex whorls with distinct suture. Transverse ribs 26-30, rather 

 prominent, the interspaces crossed by numerous crowded spiral 

 striae, one of which, a little above the middle and another at the 

 suture, are wide and deep, resembling spiral series of punctures. 

 Aperture ovate, rhombic; labium scarcely thickened. L., .22; 

 B., .05. 



According to Mr. Krebs, of St. Thomas, W. I., who examined 

 the Adams collection in 1866, there were but two miserable speci-

mens. A number of specimens found in from 1-10 feet water 

 at Bermuda by Prof. A. E. Verrill and party, 1898, differ from 

 the above only in having the fine lines also on the base. 



An example with the animal consists of 10 flat whorls below the 

 prominent, slightly oblique, flattened nucleus. Opaque white with 

 little lustre, rather stout, regularly coiled. Suture distinct. Trans- 

 verse ribs 30, narrow, rounded, perpendicular, with wider, deep 

 interspaces cut by numerous, crowded, incised, spiral lines separated 

 by fine, nearly uniform, raised threads, and two very wide and 

 deep grooves, one at the suture and one above the periphery of 

 the whorls, between which, under the microscope, the incised lines 

 number about 26, and between the upper one and the suture about 

 16. Numerous, crowded, incised, spiral lines entirely cover the 

 slightly rounded base, but the spaces between them are wider and 

 flat, rendered wavy by conspicuous, irregular lines of growth. 

 Aperture elongated; pillar-lip but little thickened, straight and 

 slightly reflected. 



Length, 6i mm. ; diameter, Hmm.; length of aperture, liinni. 



Fragments (No. 79,016) without locality were found with the 

 following species. 



Another specimen from Bermuda differs in being much stouter, 

 with 9 shorter whorls with somewhat angular body-whorl, and hav- 

 ing only 24 transverse ribs, and but 20 incised lines between the 

 grooves on the interspaces. In specimens which have been injured, 

 the number of ribs is over 40. 



The T. punicea Dall is a related species, and was dredged in 

 considerable numbers in shallow water off Cape Hatteras, N. C, 

 by the U. S. Fish Commission in 1883-1884. It is a small, slen- 

 der species, with rounded base cut by several (about 7) fine, irreg- 

 ularly arranged, incised, spiral lines. The transverse ribs are little 

 prominent with their interspaces cut by two distinct shallow 

 grooves, one sutural and the other a little wider, peripheral, 

 between which are fine, incised, unequally separated, spiral lines 

 which vary in number from 4-7 above and below the middle 

 groove ; their distinctness and arrangement very inconstant. There 

 is also a variety having still more numerous, finer and more regu- 

 larly arranged lines, 8 below and 8-13 above the peripheral groove. 

 An example loaned me by Dr. Dall is of a dull waxen color, 

 changing to pinkish brown on the last whorl and has twelve, some- 




164 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



what flattened whorls below the nucleus, which is injured. There 

 are about 20 transverse ribs on the body-whorl, thin, narrower 

 than their interspaces which, under the microscope, are crossed by 

 about 7 fine lines below and from 4 to 7 above the central groove. 

 The lines show more clearly in some positions than in others. 



Length, 8 mm. ; diameter, 15- mm. ; length of aperture, li mm.

Turbonilla substriata Tryon, Manual, viii, p. 330. pi. 76, fig. 21 (very

' ' Shell moderately elongated white, with a slight tinge of wax 

 color next above the suture, with about 22-24 transverse, rather 

 stout ribs; in the intercostal spaces and anteriorly with very numer- 

 ous crowded excessively minute spiral stria?, which are scarcely 

 perceptible under a common magnifier; on the middle of the whorls 

 is a series of spiral shallow pits in the intercostal spaces; on the last 

 whorl, with the anterior extremity of the intercostal spaces moder- 

 ately depressed, below the surface of the anterior region ; spire with 

 rectilinear outlines; whorls about eight, planulate, with a distinct 

 suture; aperture rhombic-ovate; labium scarcely thickened; um- 

 bilical region scarcely indented. Length, .115 inch; breadth, .04 

 inch." 



Two specimens (No. 72,046) without locality, were labelled as 

 this species. They are white, semitransparent and lustrous. The 

 nucleus is prominent, slightly oblique, somewhat flattened. The 

 body-whorl subangulated at the periphery with a short, but little 

 rounded base which, with the wide intercostal spaces are cut by 

 numerous, very fine, shallow, incised, spiral lines, interrupted on 

 the middle of the whorls by a much wider, inconspicuous, shallow 

 line or groove, seen only in a good light, and under the microscope; 

 above and below this, the spirals number about 30. The ends of 

 the spaces are very deep, but the fine spirals cover the entire sur- 

 face. 



Length of the larger specimens, 3| mm. ; diameter, li- mm. ; 

 length of aperture, 1 mm. 



This species is closely related to T. puncta C. B. Adams, but the 

 whorls are shorter, the ribs narrow, perpendicular, with wide inter- 

 spaces, and the spirals are not so deeply cut.

Turbonilla unilirata, new species. Plate VIII, fig. 6. 



Shell small, very slender, gradually tapered, dead white 

 (weather worn), without incised, spiral lines on the intercostal 

 spaces and base. Whorls very slightly convex, 9, in the largest 

 ■example, below the small nucleus, which is transverse to the axis, 

 with very projecting whorls. Suture deep and straight. Trans- 

 verse ribs narrow, rounded, slightly oblique, inclined to the left, 

 varying from 20-24, with wider, deep, flattened interspaces ending 

 at the periphery of the body-whorl with deeper, square-cut ends. 

 The interspaces are crossed by a single, conspicuous, raised, spiral 

 thread or lira, a little below the sutures. Base rounded, smooth. 

 Aperture somewhat elongate ; pillar dip straight, thin and slightly 

 reflected. In some of the examples the outer-lip is broken, reveal- 

 ing a spiral, tooth -like ridge on the columella. 



Length of the type, 3 mm. ; diameter, f mm. ; length of aper- 

 ture, about f mm. A larger specimen is 3-J- mm. long and about 

 4 mm. wide. 



Four specimens (Xo. 79,010) from St. Thomas, W. I., and a 

 single worn, imperfect specimen, dredged by the U. S. Fish Com- 

 mission, in 1884, off Cape Hatteras, N. C, at station 2,277, in 16 

 fathoms. 



This species was labelled as T. pusilla C. B. Adams, 1850 (not 

 Philippi, 1844), and appears to be the one figured by Tryon 

 (Manual, PL 76, fig. 19) as an example of that species. 



Turbonilla Penistoni, new species.. PI. VIII, fig. 14. 



Turbonilla pulchella Heilprin, The Bermudas, p. 173, 1889. 



Shell white, exceedingly slender, gradually tapered, semitrans- 

 parent, lustrous. Whorls moderately convex, 11, below the small 

 nucleus of 2^ very projecting whorls, transverse to the axis. Su- 

 ture deep. Transverse ribs about 15 (the specimen has been injured) 

 stout, rounded, oblique, slightly sigmoid, separated by about 

 equally wide, deep spaces which terminate at the periphery of the 

 well-rounded body-whorl Avith square-cut ends. Base rounded, 

 smooth. Aperture somewhat elongated, with the pillar-lip straight, 

 moderately thickened, reflected and forming a decided angle at its 

 juncture with the thin outer-lip. Under the microscope the entire 

 surface is covered with very fine, spiral striae. 



Length, 4i mm. ; diameter, 1 mm. ; length of aperture, about 

 1 mm. 




166 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1&99. 



The type (No. 70,024) was found by Prof. A. Heilprin and 

 party at Bermuda in 1888, and identified as T. pulchella d'Orbiguy, 

 from which species it differs decidedly in its nucleus, more slender 

 form, and oblique and curved ribs. 



Several specimens and fragments were also found at Bermuda, in 

 10-40 feet, by Prof. A. E. Verrill and party, in 1898. In these, 

 which are regularly developed, there are 18 ribs; but one example, 

 the same size as the type, has the ribs inconstantly developed, there 

 being 18 on the penultimate whorl and about 30 much fainter 

 ones on the body-whorl. This irregularity seems due to a slight 

 injury at the suture. There are also distinct lines of growth ou 

 the base and the angles of the aperture are rounded. 



A single dead specimen (No. 79,011), without locality, in the 

 R. Swift collection, has a similar prominent, projecting, transverse 

 nucleus, convex whorls and form of aperture, but the 8 whorls 

 increase very gradually, more so than in T. Swiflii, the base is but 

 little rounded with a single brown spiral line. There are 16 trans- 

 verse ribs. 



Length, 3 mm. ; diameter, about f mm. 



With a sufficient series, this may prove to be the young of a 

 distinct species as the proportions are so unlike other examples of 

 this species. 



This beautiful shell is named in honor of Miss Annie Peniston, of 

 Bermuda, who, through her keen interest in collecting specimens, 

 has aided so much in increasing the knowledge of Bermuda shells. 

 Turbonilla Swiftii, new species. 



Shell much elongated, very slender, gradually tapered, semi- 

 transparent, lustrous. Whorls slightly convex, 13 in the most per- 

 fect specimen (16 or 17 in the largest, which is broken away at the 

 top) below the prominent nucleus which is oblique, of 2i projecting 

 whorls. Suture very distinct, deep, linear, giving a noticeable 

 clean-cut effect. Transverse ribs, varying from 20-26, rounded, 

 narrow, oblique, more or less curved, separated by much wider, deep 

 spaces, which terminate on the periphery of the body-whorl with 

 more or less square-cut ends. Base rounded, smooth. Outer-lip 

 broken in all the specimens, inner- lip thin, reflected; aperture 

 somewhat elongate, expanded below, with rounded angles. In 

 some specimens there is a spiral, tooth-like ridge on the pillar-lip. 

 Fine, microscopic stria? appear only on the base. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 167 



Length of the most perfect specimen, 6 mm. ; diameter, 1 mm. ; 

 length of aperture, about 1 mm. The largest specimen, when 

 perfect, probably measured over 7 mm. 



Nine live and dead specimens (No. 72,055) from St. Thomas. 

 W. I., in the R. Swift collection were labelled as T. puhhella 

 d'Orbigny (not Odo-stomia pukhella A. Ad., 1861). That species 

 seems, however, very different, for hi a length of 7 or 8 mm. it is- 

 described as having but 12 convex whorls with the nucleus, which, 

 according to the figure, is but slightly and peculiarly tilted. The 

 number of transverse ribs is not given, but in the figure there are 

 about 18, nearly perpendicular ones. 



T. Swiflii differs from T. Penistoni, to which it is closely related. 

 in its much more elongated, more evenly tapered form, deep suture, 

 much narrower, more oblique ribs with wider interspaces, and espe- 

 cially in its less projecting, oblique nucleus. 



Turbonilla leuca, new species. 



Shell small, slender, white, semitransparent with considerable 

 lustre. Whorls convex, 9 below the prominent nucleus transverse to 

 the axis, with 24 very projecting whorls. Suture web 1 impressed. 

 Ribs prominent, nearly perpendicular, slightly curved, from 20-2-1 

 (the last whorl has been injured), separated by little wider, deep 

 spaces, terminating in rounded ends. Base well-rounded. Aper- 

 ture somewhat elongated with curved, httle thickened and reflected 

 inner-lip. 



Length, -14- mm. ; diameter, li mm. ; length of aperture, 1 mm. 



One fresh and two dead specimens were found at Bermuda, by 

 Prof. A. E. Verrill and party, 1898.

Shell small, very slender, gradually tapered, white, semitranspar- 

 ent, very lustrous, whorls moderately convex, 8 below the promi- 

 nent, slightly oblique, nearly flat nucleus of 14 but slightly project- 

 ing whorls. Suture distinct, straight. Transverse ribs about 18, 

 straight, nearly perpendicular, clean-cut, rounded, separated by 

 equally wide, deep spaces terminating at the periphery of the body- 

 whorl with square-cut ends. Base well-rounded, smooth. Outer- 

 lip broken; inner-lip thickened. Xo microscopic stria?. 



Length, 24 mm. ; diameter, about § mm. ; length of aperture. 4

168 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



The type (No. 79,009) was placed with T. Penistoni, from which 

 it is readily separated by its small size, straight ribs and very differ- 

 ent nucleus. 



Turbonilla abrupta, new species. Plate VIII, fig. 4. 



Shell of moderate size, rather stout, dead white, irregularly 

 coiled. The first 3 or 4 whorls enlarge quite abruptly, while below 

 the increase is very gradual. Whorls flattened, 9 below the small 

 nucleus, transverse to the axis, with projecting whorls. Suture 

 deep, nearly straight. Transverse ribs about 20, rounded, oblique, 

 nearly straight, separated by wider, deep, flat-bottomed spaces 

 which terminate just above the suture in very square-cut ends. 

 Base well-rounded, smooth. Aperture somewhat elongated, ex- 

 panded below with rounded angles; inner-lip thin, reflected. 



Length, 4 mm. ; diameter, 1 mm. ; length of aperture, 1 mm. 



One specimen (No. 79,012) from St. Thomas, W. I., in the R. 

 Swift collection was labelled as T. pusilla C. B. Adams. That 

 species is described as having 10 or 11 whorls below the very oblique 

 nucleus, ornamented by 12 stout, transverse -ribs. L., .135; B., 

 .03 inches. 



Turbonilla inclinata, new species. 



Shell small, slender, gradually tapered, dead white (weather 

 worn). Whorls flattened, 9 below the small nucleus, which has 

 very projecting whorls and is transverse to the axis. Suture deep 

 and straight. Transverse ribs, about 20, exceedingly oblique, in- 

 clined to ihe left, straight, flattened, rather narrow, with wider, flat- 

 bottomed, moderately deep interspaces terminating at the periphery 

 of the body-whorls in square, clean-cut ends. Pillar-lip thin, 

 reflected ; outer-lip broken. 



Length, about 3^ mm. ; diameter, |- mm. ; length of aperture, 

 about -| mm. 



One broken, dead specimen (No. 72,044), from St. Thomas, 

 W. I. , in the R. Swift collection. It is very different from all 

 other known species, and is easily distinguished by the great ob- 

 liquity of the transverse ribs, in which character it resembles the 

 much larger species, T. Campanelhe Philippi. 



Turbonilla compsa, new species. 



One very poor specimen (No. 79,015), without locality, in the R. 

 Swift collection, although without nucleus and with the outer-lip

badly broken, differs so decidedly from the other species in the 

 abrupt taper of its spire, flattened whorls and numerous, nearly 

 straight ribs, as to seem worthy of description. 



It is small, opaque white, with considerable lustre, with upper 

 portion much more abruptly tapered than the lower. The 8 whorls 

 flattened, the only curvature being just above the suture which is 

 so deep and straight that each whorl extends out abruptly beyond 

 the preceding one. Transverse ribs irregularly developed due to an 

 injury, about 30 narrow, perpendicular, straight on the upper 

 whorls, becoming slightly curved above, on the lower whorls, sep- 

 arated by wider, moderately deep spaces, which end at the periph- 

 ery of the well-rounded body-whorl in clean-cut, rounded ends. 

 Base elongate, well-rounded. Inner-lip straight, thickened. 



Length, 3f mm. ; diameter, about 1 mm. 

 Turbonilla Dalli, new species. Plate VIII, fig. 8. 



This is a large, stout, regularly coiled, very beautiful species, 

 bluish white, semitransparent, with dull lustre. Suture unusually 

 deep, but not channeled. Whorls very convex, 12 below the 

 prominent nucleus of 2 projecting whorls transverse to the axis. 

 Transverse ribs 16, often opaque white, very prominent, slightly 

 oblique, separated by very deep, concave, about equally wide 

 spaces, which terminate in clean, square-cut ends, sometimes just 

 above the suture. Base short, moderately convex, smooth. Aper- 

 ture squarish ; the outer-lip thin, greatly expanded, turning in 

 abruptly to meet the straight, much thickened, not reflected, 

 pillar-lip in a rounded angle. The entire surface covered with 

 exceedingly fine microscopic stria?. 



Length of largest specimen (apex gone), 8 i mm. ; diameter, 

 2^- mm.; length of aperture, 1^ mm. 



Three live specimens (No. 72,049) were found at Sarasota Bay, 

 Fla. , by Mr. H. Hemphill. A single, large, imperfect specimen 

 (No. 94,804, U. S. N. M.), from Cape Hatteras, N. C, loaned 

 me by Dr. Dall, agrees perfectly with these specimens. 



A poor worn specimen (No. 10,310, Peabody Museum), from 

 Egmont Keys, Fla. 

 Turbonilla Hemphilli, new species. Plate VIII, fig. S. 



This species is closely related to the preceding, but is more 

 slender, longer, with more pointed apex, smaller nucleus, less con- 

 vex whorls, more numerous ribs and mure elongated aperture..

 small nucleus, with projecting whorls, transverse to the axis 

 Transverse ribs about 20, rather stout, nearly perpendicular,, 

 rounded, separated by about equally wide, deep, concave spaces 

 terminating at the periphery of the body- whorl in clean-cut ends. 

 Base rounded, smooth. Aperture squarish, somewhat expanded 

 below, with rounded angles; inner-lip thickened, reflected. Entire 

 surface covered by very fine, microscopic stria?. 



Length of the largest specimen (apex gone), 9 mm.; diameter,

Three live specimens (No. 79,013) were found at Sarasota Bay,. 

 Fla., by Mr. H. Hemphill. 



Three poor, worn specimens (No. 10,302, Peabody Museum) 

 from West Florida, collected by Col. Jewett. 

 Turbonilla atypha, new species. 



Two badly worn, imperfect specimens (No. 70,537) from Mal- 

 donado Bay, in 3-6 fathoms. Uruguay, both destitute of apices 

 and having the outer-lip broken away, are so distinct from any 

 other species as to be worthy of mention. 



Shell of good size, long and moderately slender, thick, opaque 

 white, tinted with yellow at the sutures, with considerable lustre. 

 The larger specimen has 10 flattened whorls, having a slight bulge 

 just above the well marked suture. Transverse ribs about 20, 

 ill-defined, not reaching quite to the lower suture, broadly rounded, 

 straight, very oblique, gradually decreasing in prominence as the 

 shell increases, so that on the body-whorl they show but faintly. 

 Interspaces narrow and shallow. Base elongate, well-rounded, 

 smooth. Aperture badly broken; inner-lip considerably thickened 

 and reflected. 



Length of the larger specimen, 7i mm. ; diameter, 14 mm. ; 

 length of aperture, about 1-J- mm. 



This species is more slender and more gradually tapered, with 

 fewer and less distinct ribs than T. Uruguayensis, described and 

 figured by Mr. Pilsbry, 1897.

The T. interrupta Totten may be a stout variety of the Northern species. 



6 The fossil form described and figured as T. paiteistriata Jeffreys, is a 

 distinct species which may be designated as T. Meyeri.

NOTES ON A SMALL COLLECTION OF CHINESE FISHES. 

 BY HENRY W. FOWLER. 



During the summer of 1897, Dr. A. Donaldson Smith and 

 Messrs. J. Edward and George Famum collected the material 

 which forms the basis of tins paper while travelling through eastern 

 China and Mongolia. The specimens were collected in several 

 localities. All the Cobitidre and Leuciscus costatus were obtained 

 from a fisherman, who caught them in the Tan Ian Ho, a tributary 

 of the Shu Ian Ho, June 11. This locality is about thirty miles 

 northeast of Larna-miau or Dolon-nor, in the Province of Pechili. 

 Carassius auratus and two specimens of Leuciscus farnumi are from 

 Delai Xor. These were purchased July 4. The type of Leuciscus 

 farnumi and the specimens of Pseudaspius leptocevhalus and 

 Opsariichtliys bidens were taken in the Tore river, a tributary of 

 the Sungari, July 27. 



Through the liberality of the above-mentioned gentlemen, the 

 collection becomes the property of the Academy of Natural 

 Sciences of Philadelphia, and adds several species which are new 

 to its collections.

A SMALL COLLECTION OF REPTILES AND BATRACHIANS 

 FROM EASTERN MONGOLIA. 



BY WITHER STONE. 



Through the generosity of Messrs. J. Edward and George Far- 

 mini, and of Dr. A. Donaldson Smith, the Academy has received a 

 small collection of Eeptiles and Batrachians collected by them on 

 an expedition through eastern Mongolia, undertaken in May-July, 

 1897. 



Although none of the species represented are new to science, a 

 list of them will prove of value as adding to our knowledge of their 

 geographic distribution. 



BATRACHIA. 

 Rana dybowskii Gtinth. 



Three specimens taken east of the Kiu-ghan mountains. Bou- 

 lenger regards this Asiatic form as identical with the R. temporaria 

 of Europe. It is probable, however, that it represents at least a 

 geographic race. 

 Rana chinensis Osbeck. 



One specimen from Khiu-ghan mountains, and two from 

 Lama-mio. 



This frog is clearly distinct from R. esculenta. Boulenger 

 regarded it as a subspecies in his Catalogue of the Batrachia Sali- 

 entia and named it japonica. R. marmorata of Hallowell has clear 

 priority over this name and, according to Boulenger (Tailless 

 Batrachia of Europe), R. chinensis Osbeck is based upon the same 

 animal and is prior to either. 

 Bufo japonicus Schleg. 



Two specimens from the Tore river. 



I follow the British Museum Catalogue in regarding the Asiatic 

 and Japanese animals as identical. Should they prove recognizable 

 races, the above name will apply to the island form. 

 Bufo raddei Straueh. 



One specimen from a lake near Lama-mio and seven others 

 from various localities in eastern Mongolia. 




184 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



One other example from Tore river is almost unicolor above, 

 and the pores of the dorsal warts are swollen up into minute pus- 

 tules. These peculiarities are probably due to the very strong for- 

 malin solution in which this specimen was preserved. 



Hyla chinensis immaculata Boetger. 



Three specimens of Tree Toads from near Tore river are referred 

 to this form, though lack of material for comparison makes a satis- 

 factory identification difficult. One individual is practically 

 immaculate, the others have indistinct dusky spots on the sides 

 and obscure bands on the legs, and mottlings on the backs of the 

 tibiae and tarsi. 



REPTILIA. 

 Eremias argus Peters. 



Four specimens from the Kiu-ghan mountains. 



AmpMesma tigrinum Boie. 



One specimen from Peking, and one from northern Pechili. 



Coluber dione Pall. 



One adult and one very young specimen from northern Pechili. 

 The latter is marked with great distinctness. 



Halys blomhoffii (Boie). 



One specimen from northern Pechili, and another from Mon- 

 golia east of the Kiu-ghan mountains The latter has eight upper 

 labials on one side and seven on the other.

NEW AND LITTLE-KNOWN SPECIES OF PRISTILOMA. 

 BY HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



In the handbooks of American land mollusks published by Mi*. 

 W. G. Binney, as well as in the more general Manual of Tryon, 

 but two species of the genus Pristiloma are recorded: P. Lansing i 

 and P. Stearnsi, both described by Thomas Bland in 1875. The 

 original figures and descriptions may also be found in Binney' s 

 Manual of American Land Shells (1885), and additional informa- 

 tion, especially as to distribution, is given by the same industrious 

 author in the Supplements to the Fifth Volume of Terrestrial Mol- 

 lusks. To these sources reference is made for the literature of the 

 species. 



A third species, apparently of this genus, was described from 

 Point Barrow, Alaska, by Mr. E. Lehnert, in 1884, under the 

 name Hyalina arctica ; and Mr. E. G. Vanatta has quite recently 

 described a fourth one. 1 In adding the fifth species to the genus, 

 I have felt it incumbent on me to redefine and figure Lehnert' s 

 Hyalina arctica, until now unfigured, and not described with 

 sufficient exactness to insure recognition, 2 nor mentioned in the 

 Zoological Record. 



Pristiloma is probably closely allied to Conulus, differing from 

 that genus chiefly, so far as known, in the ribbed or plaited jaw- 

 But it is only in P. Laming i and P. Stearnsi that this form of jaw 

 has been demonstrated; and the other species herein considered to 

 be congeneric with those mentioned are referred to that genus 

 solely upon the resemblance of the shells. Some of them may 

 prove to be depressed forms of Conulus, as Dall (in litt. ) suggests 

 to me. 

 Pristiloma Taylori n. sp. PI. IX, figs. 6, 7, 8. 



Shell imperforate, discoidal, thin, transparent, corneous, clearly 

 showing the yellow soft parts when these are dried in it ; surface 



1 These Proceedings, p. 120. 



2 That this is the case is shown by the fact that it has hitherto been 

 referred to P. Stearnsi as a synonym, though it is much more nearly allied 

 to P. Lansingi.

smooth and glossy, with faint growth-striae. Spire almost fiat, 

 comparatively narrow, slightly more than half the greatest diame- 

 ter of the shell; whorls four, the nucleus rather large, whorls 

 slowly increasing, the last wide, double the width of the preceding, 

 equably rounded at the periphery, flattened beneath, with a deep 

 indentation around the axis. Aperture oblique, broadly lunate; 

 peristome simple, thin and acute, the upper termination inserted 

 decidedly above the periphery, baso-columellar margin straightened. 

 Alt., 1.1; greatest diameter, 2.5; lesser, 2.16 mm. 



Nanaimo, Vancouver Island, near the water- works (Rev. 

 George W. Taylor, July 25, 1895). 



This species is named in recognition of Mr. Taylor's services to 

 malacological science, and especially to the conchology of British 

 America. It differs conspicuously from all the species hitherto 

 known by the narrow spire, the last whorl embracing a much more 

 considerable portion of the preceding, the conspicuously wider aper- 

 ture, and the almost flat upper surface. Generic position unverified. 

 Pristiloma arctica (Lehnert). PL IX, figs. 3, 4, 5. 



Hyalina arctica Lehnert, Science Record, ii, p. 172, June 16, 1884 

 (Boston, S. E. Cassino & Co.). 



Through the kindness of Prof. "W. H. Dall, I have been enabled 

 to figure one of the original specimens of this species, No. 108, 

 228, U. S. National Museum. It is a glossy shell with the general 

 features of P. Lansingi ; growth-stria? faint, spire low-conic, 

 whorls 4f , slowly and regularly increasing, the last not dispropor- 

 tionately wide as in P. Taylori, but about as in P. Lansingi. 

 Aperture narrowly crescentic as in the last-named species. It 

 measures, alt., 1.58; diam. , 2.66 mm. The width of the spire a 

 little exceeds two -thirds the greatest diameter of the shell. 



Point Barrow. Alaska; found among moss, lichens and other 

 plants used for packing material. 



The specimen figured had been broken on the front of the body- 

 whorl, and the outline there has been restored in figures 4 and 5. 



It differs from P. Stearnsi (Bid.) in surface sculpture and 

 smaller size; from P. Lansingi (Bid.), with which it agrees in the 

 characters mentioned, as well as in the nearly vertical aperture, 

 it differs in the lower, submedian position of the periphery, and in 

 wanting the denticulate lip-rib so prominent in that species. 



For comparison I have figured a specimen of P. Lansingi (PI. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 187 



IX, figs. 1. 2), as the original figures given by Bland and repro- 

 duced by Binney are rather crude. This specimen measures, alt. , 

 1.58; greatest diameter, 2.62; lesser diain., 2.4 mm., almost 

 exactly the same as P. arctica. It has fully 5J whorls. 



Whether the lip-rib will prove a constant character of P. Lan* 

 singi, and constantly wanting in P. arctica, can only be decided by 

 larger series than have yet been collected; but the slightly greater 

 number of whorls of Lansing i in a shell of the. same size, with the 

 higher position of the periphery, apparently indicate that P. arctica 

 is specifically distinct, and unless specimens of intermediate charac- 

 ters come to light, it must stand as a species. 



Prof. William H. Dall tells me that he collected arctica at Coal 

 Harbor in the Shumagin islands, and it was taken by Turner at 

 Unalashka. He believes it may prove to be a flat-topped species 

 of Ckmulus. 



The species of Pristiloma now known may be recognized by the 

 following key: 



a. — Shell sculptured with radial grooves above; lip simple and 



acute. 



b. — Grooves crowded, not very deep; spire conic; whorls 



about 7; diam. 3 or 4 mm. . . P. Stearnsi (Bid.). 



b' — Grooves deep, separated, the whorls with a corona of low 



tubercles; whorls 5£; diam. 2.56 mm. P. PilsbryiYsm. 



a'. — Shell nearly smooth throughout. 



b. — Aperture broadly lunate; no lip-callus; spire narrow, 

 almost flat; whorls 4, the last wide; diameter more 

 than double the altitude; diam. 2.5, alt. 1.1 mm., 



P. Tayfori Pils. 



b'. — Aperture narrowly crescentic; spire low-conic; whorls 



regularly widening; diameter less than double the 



altitude. 



c. — A denticulate lip- rib within the margin of the outer 



lip ; periphery above the middle ; whorls 5^ ; alt. 



1.58. diam. 2.62 mm. . . P. Lansingi (Bid.). 



c'. — Xo lip-rib; periphery submedian; whorls 4f ; alt. 1.58,

ASHMUNELLA, A NEW GENUS OF HELICES. 

 BY H. A. PILSBRY AND T. D. A. COCKERELL. 1 



The boundaries of New Mexico and Arizona fairly define a region 

 of arid plains from which rise numerous mountain ranges, 

 upon whose summits the humidity refused by the dry and warmer 

 air of the plains is precipitated. Upon the elevations thus set 

 apart by the circumstance of a moister and colder climate, the 

 snails inhabiting the region are chiefly found. And standing 

 island-like in a waterless sea, the mountains exhibit to a consider- 

 able extent the peculiarities of insular faunas, each range having 

 its own special assembly of forms, specific or varietal, in addition 

 to a series of species common to ranges over the greater part of the 

 region. 



A characteristic element in this fauna is ihe series of helicoid 

 snails now segregated under the generic name Ashmunella, so called 

 in recognition of the fact that the Rev. E. H. Ashmun, of 

 Albuquerque, N. M., discovered most of the species. This genus 

 occurs in New Mexico from the latitude of Santa Fe to the White 

 mountains, and westward to S. E. Arizona. It is not impossible 

 that it may yet be found in the Sierra Madre mountains of Mex- 

 ico ; but it surely does not extend to California or Colorado. It is 

 an interesting coincidence, if nothing more, that its northern limit 

 is nearly that of the supposed southern limit of glaciers in the 

 Rocky mountain region during the ice age. 



The more important characters of Ashmunella may be stated as 



follows : 



Generic Characters of Ashmunella. 2 



The shell offers no characters different from the Triodopsis or

 and Nautilus, xii, p. 107.

Mesodon sections of Polygyra. It is helicoid, depressed and urn- 

 bilicated, dull colored, not banded so far as known, with lunate 

 aperture and reflexed peristome ; parietal tooth, when present, 

 simple, not V-shaped or biramose. 



External features of the soft parts as in normal Polygyra or 

 Epiphragmophora species. In A. miorhyssa the whole foot is gray- 

 ish white ; the tentacles and the dorsal surface of the animal ante- 

 riorly are dark plumbeous. 



Retractor muscles of buccal mass and tentacles of the ordinary 

 type, the right ocular and tentacular retractor passing between the 

 cf and 9 branches of the genital system. 



c? system: Penis composed of a narrow upper portion and an 

 abruptly much more capacious lower portion ; lumen with three 

 strong longitudinal ribs along the outer wall and numerous much 

 smaller folds elsewhere, no papilla or distinct pilaster. Penis 

 retractor muscle very short, inserted upon the epiphallus near its 

 lower end, a portion of it passing to the apex of the penis. Epiph- 

 allus distinctly differentiated from both penis and vas deferens, very 




190 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



long, terminating in a very short flagellum and the long free vas 

 deferens. 



? system: Vagina moderately long, with internal folds continu- 

 ous with those of the atrium. Spermatheca long, not differentiated 

 into duct and spermatheca proper, but consisting of a long, some- 

 what folded tube of nearly equal diameter throughout, the apex 

 free and lying near the heart. Talon simple, vermiform. Other 

 organs as usual (fig. 1). Measurements of the principal organs, 

 pulled straight, are as follows: Length of penis, 10^ mm. ; of 

 epiphallus, 31 ; of flagellum, 2 mm. Length of spermatheca, 27 

 mm., including the inseparable duct. 



The lung is of normal proportions ; there is a single large pulmo- 

 nary vein with numerous much smaller branches on each side ; 

 heart at base of kidney, the pericardium thin and transparent. 

 Kidney small and rather short, though slightly over double the 

 length of the heart, with distinct reflexed ureter, the " secondary 

 ureter" (' ' Darmharnleiter ' " ') apparently closed throughout. 



Jaw (fig. 2) quite arcuate, with about eight ribs denticulating 

 the basal margin, the ends free from ribs. 



Radula with 26-1-26 teeth (fig. 3), the rhachidian row tricuspid, 

 the side cusps small, laterals with the usual large mesocone, small 

 ectocone and rudimentary entocone, marginals with the mesocone 

 bifid at tip, the outer ones with the ectocone split. The transition 

 from laterals to marginals occurs from the eleventh to the thirteenth 

 teeth. 



I Affinities of the Genus. 3 



The appearance of the shell is so completely that of Polygyra 

 that in attempting to decide its affinities one approaches the ques- 

 tion somewhat prejudiced. Turning to the genitalia, we find that 

 the male system is completely that of Epiphragmop horn and the 

 Belogonous Helices generally. The well-developed epiphallus and 

 the short but unmistakable flagellum are structures which are wholly 

 foreign to Polygyra. 4 Again, the long spermatheca with its apex 

 lodged near the heart, utterly unlike the short and differently 

 situated spermatheca of Polygyra, is like Epijihragviophora and 



3 By H. A. Pilsbry alone. 



4 The genitalia of nearly every United States species of Polygyra are 

 known, either by the published work of Mr. W. G. Binney or by MS. 

 descriptions and drawings of Messrs. H. A. Pilsbry and E. G. Vanatta. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 191 



other Belogonous genera, though peculiar in wanting a differentiated 

 receptacle and duct. 



In the genital system, therefore, P. miorhyssa has no resem- 

 blance to Polygyra and its allies, Praticolella and Polygyrelhi ; and, 

 in fact, could not be included among the Protogonous Helices. 

 The genitalia are those of the Epiphallogona or of Belogona 

 •which have undergone degeneration of the dart sack and associated 

 mucous glands. 5 The first of these groups includes the large, 

 heavy, dark-colored Helices of the "West Indies and South Amer- 

 ica (Pleurodonte) , and various Oriental forms ( Camama, Planispira, 

 etc.), all quite unlike Ashmunella conchologically. The characters 

 of the lung and kidney cannot be adequately discussed owing to the 

 lack of published data of sufficient exactness, but the high value of 

 these organs in classification demonstrated by a mass of unpublished 

 data demands brief mention here. In Polygyra the kidney is very 

 long, usually over half the entire length of the lung cavity, 6 and is 

 band or ribbon-shaped, while Epiphragmophora has a short kidney, 

 hardly one-third the length of the lung cavity. In A. miorhyssa . 

 the kidney is short, like that of Epiphragmophora, and quite 

 unlike the kidney of any Polygyra yet examined. 



The jaw and radula give no characters differentiating Ashmunella 

 from Polygyra, Epiphragmophora or numerous other genera of 

 ground-living helices. The teeth are very similar to those of 

 Polygyra. 



In the shell we can find no characters whatever which are not 

 readily paralleled in Polygyra. Some of the Epiphragmophoras 

 of the islands off California and Lower California are somewhat 

 similar in shell characters. 



Upon the whole, it seems likely that Ashmunella is a member 

 of the Belogona Euadenia or Asiatico-American group of dart- 



5 See tinder Metafruticicola, etc., in the " Guide to the Study of Helices." 

 American examples of partial degeneration of these appendages are Epiphrag- 

 mophora guadalupiana and the genus Glyptostoma. See Proc. Acad. Nat. 

 Sci. Phila., 1898, p. 67. 



6 The exceptions are P. septemvoha and probably its immediate allies, 

 with very narrow whorls, in which the lung, in common with the whole 

 mantle, is excessively lengthened in harmony with the narrow cavity of the 

 shell, while the kidney and heart retain the form found in species with 

 normally proportioned shells. This exception is no argument against the 

 value of the form of the kidney as an index of affinity, but rather one in 

 its favor. 




192 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



bearers, which has lost the dart apparatus, and developed apertural 

 characters in the shell similar to those of Polygyra ; though it is 

 possible that the genus is a member of the Epiphallogona, with 

 which Ashmunella agrees better technically in the features of the 

 genitalia.

 The species are unequally related. Their relationships inter se are 

 shown by the following keys for the determination of known forms: 7 



a. — Aperture strongly tridentate Thomsoniaaa. 



a'. — Aperture toothless or without teeth on the outer lip. 

 b. — Diameter less than double the altitude. 



rhyssa, including miorhyssa. 

 b'. — Diameter about double the altitude. 



c. — Surface heavily ribbed; a slight basal tooth or none. 



altissima. 

 c'. — Surface nearly smooth. 



d. — Basal lip with two contiguous teeth; a parietal 



tooth or none pseudodonta. 



d'. — Basal lip toothless. 



e. — Whorls 5; diam. 12-14 mm. . Ashmuni. 

 e'. — Whorls 6; diam. 16-19 mm.; peristome 



slighter chiricahuana. 



The three main groups indicated in the above table are Thom- 

 soniana — rhyssa including miorhyssa and hyporhyssa — altissima, 

 pseudodonta, Ashmuni, chiricahuana. 



Mr. Cockered arranges the forms somewhat differently, thus : 



1. Aperture hardly dentate, with at most a small parietal denticle 



and a callus or pair of low and small denticles on the basal 



part of the aperture 2 



Aperture strongly dentate, both on the parietal wall and lip; 

 whorls 5i Thomsoniana (Ancey). 



2. Shell distinctly ribbed 3 



Shell striate or nearly smooth 4 



3. Compact, spire elevated ; diam. 15-17 mm. . rhyssa (Dall). 

 Small and flat; diam. 12 mm altissima (Ckll. ). 



4. Shell compact, with rounded whorls; spire elevated ; last whorl 



large ; striation well marked 5 



Flattened, with a depressed spire; shell feebly striate or nearly 

 smooth, with more or less distinct spiral incised lines ; umbili- 

 cus wide, broadly exposing the penultimate whorl. . . 6 



7 The first key is by Mr. Pilsbry, the second by Mr. Cockerell. 

 13 




194 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



5. Larger, aperture broader and more circular; umbilicus narrow. 



miorhyssa (Dall). 



Smaller, aperture semilunar ; umbilicus wider, broadly exposing 



the penultimate whorl hyporhyssa (Ckll.). 



6. Max. diam. less than 15 mm 7 



Max. diam. over 15 mm 8 



7. Basal part of aperture with a couple of obtuse denticles, 



pseudodonta (Dall). 

 Basal part of aperture without any denticles. Ashmuni (Dall). 



8. Deeper colored; basal part of aperture with a more or less bifid 



callosity capitanensis Ashmun and Ckll. 



Paler ; basal part of aperture without any callosity. 



chiricahuana (Dall). 



It is a matter of taste how many of the above are to be regarded 

 as species. The characters appear to be uniform in series of speci- 

 mens, and each form inhabits its own special region. There are 

 three distinct groups: the first, consisting of rhyssa, altissima, 

 miorhyssa and hyporhyssa, is confined to Sierra Blanca and the 

 immediate vicinity, so far as known; the second, containing pseudo- 

 donta, Ashmuni, capitanensis and chiricahuana, occurs in the Capi- 

 tan mountains and vicinity (the forms with the bifid basal callus), 

 in the Jemez mountains and vicinity, and in southeast Arizona 

 (forms without a basal callus on aperture) ; the third, possibly 

 distinct from true Ashmunella, includes Thomsoniana, from the 

 Santa Fe region.

CONTRIBUTIONS TO A KNOWLEDGE OF THE HYMENOPTERA OF BRA- 

 ZIL, NO. 6.-A COLLECTION FROM RIO GRANDE 

 DO SUL AND SAO PAULO. 



BY WILLIAM J. FOX. 



The .small collection on which the present paper is based was 

 received for identification from the Museu Panlista of Sao Paulo, 

 Brazil, and is of interest through the large number of species which 

 are not represented in the Herbert Smith collection, on which the 

 previous papers of this series are based, which would seemingly 

 indicate that the fauna of the southeastern region of Brazil differs 

 considerably from that of the more inland northern States, Matto 

 Grosso and Para, where the Smith collection was largely made. 



Unless otherwise stated, the specimens were collected in Rio 

 Grande do Sul. The types of new species are the property of the

SOME UNTENABLE NAMES IN ORNITHOLOGY. 

 BY HAERY C. OBERHOLSER. 



The folloAviug notes, gathered during the course of recent sys- 

 tematic investigations, are here published in advance of other 

 papers whose appearance is necessarily for some time delayed 

 They relate chiefly to generic terms, although a few changes in 

 specific names are introduced. The lists of recognized species are 

 as complete as available means have permitted 



The writer is under obligation to Dr. C. W. Richmond for vari- 

 ous courtesies, as well as to Dr. Walter Faxon, Mr. Samuel Hen- 

 shaw and Mr. Witmer Stone for assistance in verification of refer- 

 ences. 



MICRURIA Grant. 



This generic name, as used by Mr. Ogilvie-Grant, 1 is preoc- 

 cupied in Coleoptera by Micruria Reitter.' Since by reason of the 

 very long tarsi, tail of 12 feathers, and Ihe absence of any spotted 

 condition of plumage, this appears to be a well-defined group, it 

 may bear the name Endomychura, from ^Sofw/os, occultus, and 

 oupd, cauda; the type being Brachyrhamphus hypoleucus Xantus. 



The two species are 



Endomychura hypoleuca (Xantus). 

 Endomychura crave ri (Salvadori). 



EUHYAS Sharpe. 



Euhyas Sharpe 3 is untenable because of Euhyas Fitzinger, 4 pro- 

 posed for a genus of reptiles. In its stead may be employed Zap- 

 term, from £«, valde, and -rspov, ala. The type and only species 

 is Charadrius leucurus Lichtenstein, which will now stand as 



Zapterus leucurus (Lichtenstein).

202 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



DEFILIPPIA Salvadori. 



The generic terra Defilippia Salvadori 1 is preoccupied in Diptera 

 by Defilippia Lioy. 2 The proper name of the genus is Hemiparra 

 Salvadori, 3 for although no description is given, Chettusia crassi- 

 rostris DeFilippi is mentioned as the type, Avhich, of course, is 

 sufficient to fix the name. 



The two species should be called 



Hemiparra crassirostris (DeFilippi). 



Hemiparra leucoptera (Reichenow). 



PHYLLOPEZUS Sharpe. 



The name Phyllopezus Sharpe 4 must give way ou account of 

 Phyllopezus Peters, 5 a genus of reptiles. It may be replaced by 

 Actopjhilus, from a/-r h litus, aud ptAiai, amo; the type being Parra 

 afr lean a Gmel i n . 



The two species are 



Actophihis (ifrieanus (Gmelin). 



Aetophiltis albinuchus (Ts. Geoffrey). 



ORTHOCNEMUS Milne-Edwards. 



Orthocnemus Milne-Edwards 6 is antedated in Coleoptera by 

 Orthocnemus Jekel ; 7 and may be called Idiornis (ffleoy, distinctus, 

 opvfs, avis), with Orthocnemus g alliens Milne-Edwards as the type. 



The described forms are 



Idiornis gallicm (Milne-Edwards). 



Idiornis cursor (Milne-Edwards). 



Idiornis major (Milne-Edwards). 



Idiornis minor (Milne-Edwards). 



TAPINOPUS Milne-Edwards. 



The term Tapinopus Milne -Ed wards 8 is preoccupied by Tapinojnis 

 Saussure 9 , for a genus of Orthoptera. It may be replaced by 



1 Atti. Soc. Jtal, viii, 1865, p. 373.

Diatropornis, from dcd-po-or, differeus, and op>i?, avis; the type 

 and only species being Tapinopus ellioti Milne-Edwards. This will 

 now stand as 



Diatropornis ellioti (Milne-Edwards). 



PERISTERA Swainson. 



The Columbine genus Peristera Swainson 1 is untenable because 

 of Peristera Rafinesque 2 in Mollusca; and may be called Claravis, 

 from clara (clarus) and avis, the type being Columba einerea 

 Temminck. The name of this species, however, should be pretiosa 

 Ferrari-Perez; 3 for Columba einerea Temminck and Knip 4 is pre- 

 occupied by Columba einerea Scopoli. 5 



The species will then stand as follows : 



Claravis pretiosa ( Ferrari -Perez). 



Claravis geoffroyi (Temminck and Knip). 



Claravis mondetoura ( Bonaparte). 



HARPE Bonaparte. 



Harpe Bonaparte 6 is preoccupied in ichthyology by Harpe Lace- 

 pede. 7 Harpa Sharpe, 8 for the same group, is also unteuable on 

 account of Harpa Lamarck, 9 a genus of Mollusca. As no other 

 name is available, there may be proposed Nesierax, from vyffos, 

 insula, and lipaSj, accipiter, with Faleo novas-zealandia} Gmelin as 

 type. 



The species are 



Xesiera.r noca'-zealaadicB ( Gmelin). 



Nesierax australis (Hombron and Jacquinot). 



PACHYNTJS Reichenow. 

 Not only is Paehynus Reichenow 10 preoccupied in Hemiptera by 

 Pachyruus StaJ, 1866, and thus untenable under any circumstances, 

 but it is not the earliest available name for the genus. Graydi-

dascalus Bonaparte 1 has nearly thirty years' priority, and there 



seems to be no valid reason for its rejection. 



The type and only species should therefore stand as 

 Graydidascalus braehyurus (Temminck and Kuhl). 



HEMILOPHUS Swainson. 



The name Hem i lop h us Swainsoir is preoccupied in Coleoptera by 

 Hemilophus Serville. 3 The next name seems to be Mulleripims 

 Bonaparte, 4 type Picus pulverulentus Temminck. 



The only recognized species is 



Mulleripicus pulverulentus (Temminck). 



DENDROBATES Swainson. 



Dr. C. W. Richmond has already pointed out 5 that Dendrobates 

 Swainson 6 is untenable by reason of a batrachian genu 3 , Dendro- 

 bates Wagleiy but proposed that Eleopieus Bonaparte 8 be used in 

 ■its place. The proper name, however, would appear to be Ven- 

 iliornis Bonaparte, since in the list of genera (I. c. ) this is num- 

 bered 21, while under it are ranged as subgenera Venilia and 

 Eleopieus, all the species contained in both being now included in 

 the genus Dendrobates. This name Veniliornis has been generally 

 ignored, but there seems to be no doubt of the propriety of accept- 

 ing it for the group in question, rather than either of its subgenera 

 — one of the two alternatives being necessary. No type is indi- 

 cated, neither is there a subgenus Veniliornis ; but the first species 

 mentioned, Pirns sanguineus Lichtenstein, may be taken as the 

 typical one. 



With regard to specific names in this group, there are two of 

 those accepted in the eighteenth volume of the British Museum 

 Catalogue of Birds that require to be changed; while some doubt 

 attaches to a third. The correct name of the bird known as peru- 

 vianus Taczanowski is Callonotus major Berlepsch and Taczau., 9

which antedates the former by three years. There seems to be no 

 reason why the name passerinus Linnaeus 1 should not be employed 

 for the species now called tephrodops, as the former is of undoubted 

 application, and of much earlier date. Picas affirm Swainson, 3 

 now Dendrobates affirm, is possibly rendered untenable by Picus 

 affirm Raffles, 3 but as it has been impossible at present to obtain the 

 exact date of this part of Swainson' s Zoological Illustrations, no 

 change in this name is here made. 



The species of this genus are as follows : 



Yeniliornis fumigatus (Lafresnaye and d'Orbigny). 



Veniliornis caboti (Malherbe). 



Veniliornis oleaginus (Lichtenstein). 



Veniliornis sanguinolentus (Sclater).

HARPACTES Swainsou. 



The generic term Harpactes Swainson 1 cannot be used because of 

 Harpactes Templeton, 2 a genus of Arachnida, as already noted by 

 Dr. C. W. Richmond, 3 and previously by Cabanis. 4 The next 

 name, Hapalurus Reichenbach, 5 is preoccupied by Hapalura 

 Cabanis, which is a synonym of Oulicivora; and Duvaucelius 

 Bonaparte, 7 besides an uncertainty regarding the identity of the 

 type species, is untenable on account of Duvaucelia Desvoidy. 8 

 This gives a clear title to Pyrotrogon Bonaparte, 9 of which the type 

 is Trogon ardens Temmiuck. 



The species are 



Pyrotrogon diardii (Temmiuck). 



Pyrotrogon kasumba (Raffles). 



Pyrotrogon fasciatus (Pennant). 



Pyrotrogon ardens (Temmiuck). 



Pyrotrogon whiteheadi I Sharpe). 



Pyrotrogon erythrocephalus (Gould) 



Pyrotrogon erythrocephalus flagrans ( Muller). 



Pyrotrogon duvaueelii (Temmiuck). 



Pyrotrogon orrhophceus (Cabanis). 



Pyrotrogon viduus (Grant). 



Pyrotrogon oreshios (Temmiuck). 



Pyrotrogon dulitensis (Grant). 



AMAZILIA Reichenbach. 



The name Amazilia Reichenbach 1 " is not the earliest one for the 

 genus of humming-birds to which it has been applied, as the follow- 

 ing discussion will show. Lesson, in 1832, u made use of the term 

 " Les Amazilis " as a popular heading for one of his groups, includ- 

 ing under this the species Omismya amazili Less. ; indicating by 

 the manner of its use that he did not intend Amazilis as a generic

term. Gray, however, 1 evidently considers it as such, as witness 

 some notes sent by Mr. Witmer Stone, who kindly verified the 

 original reference: " On page 107, in footnote to Genus Polytmus, 

 he [Gray] says that it includes a number of genera of various 

 authors, among which he gives ' Les Amizilis Less. (1829),' appa- 

 rently quoting the above and misspelling it. On page 108, in the 

 list of species of Polytmvs he gives under P. [olytmus], amazili 

 (Less.), ' Type of Amizilis Less. (1829);' referring to the same 

 again and turning it into a Latin name." The following year 

 Gray again makes use of the term Amizilis " Lesson," 2 this time as 

 a generic heading, under which are placed the species A. latirostris 

 (Sw. ) and Or. amazili Less. There thus appears to be no reason 

 for the non-acceptance of Gray's Amizilis — the type of which may 

 properly be considered to be Ortkorhynehus amazili Lesson — 

 whether we allow the genus to date from 1840 or 1841, since in 

 either case it is several years anterior to Amazilia Reichenbach. 



The species for which Mr. Salvia uses the name pristina Gould, 

 should be called amazili Lesson, 3 this being its earliest name. The 

 species commonly known as viridiventris Reichenbach is a parallel 

 case, its proper name being viridigastra Bourcier. 4 The forms, 

 erybhronota, felicicB and alicice are distinguished from tobaci by 

 characters too slight and inconstant to entitle them to more than 

 subspecific rank. 



The species are

HETEROPELMA Bonaparte.

 Heteropelma Wesmael. 2 It may be called Scotothorus, from trzoros, 

 obscuritas. and dopstv, cursare ; the type being Museieapa turdina 

 Maximilian. 



The name of the bird usually known as Heteropelma vire&cens 

 (Max.) should be changed to unieolor Bonaparte, 3 since Museieapa 

 virescens Maximilian 4 is untenable by reason of Museieapa virescens 

 Temminck, 5 which is a synonym of Phyllomyias brevirostris 

 (Spix).

The term Metopia Swainson 1 must be displaced on account of 

 Metopia Meigen," a genus of Diptera. The proper name is Anti- 

 lop h ia Reichenbach . 3 



The type and only species wdl therefore stand as 



Antilophia galeata (Lichtensteiu). 



GYMNOCEPHALUS Geoffrey St.-Hilaire. 



The genus Gymriocep>halus Geoffroy St.-Hilaire 4 must give way 

 to Gymnocephalus Bloch and Schneider. 5 In its stead may be 

 employed Perissocephalus, from -spttrao^, mirabttis, and -/.zyolr^ 

 caput. The type and sole species is Corvus calvus Gmelin, which 

 should now be called 



Perissocephalus calvus (Gmelin). 



HETEKOCNEMIS Sclater. 



Heterocnemis Sclater 6 is preoccupied by Heterocnemis Albers 7 for 

 a genus of Coleoptera. Since the only other name for this group 

 of birds, Holocnemis Strickland, 8 is untenable because of Holoc- 

 aemis Schilling, 9 in Coleoptera, as pointed out by Dr. Sclater 

 (I. c. ), it is proposed to substitute Sclater ia, in honor of Dr. P. L.

Sclater, and iu recognition of his extensive contributions to Neo- 

 tropical ornithology. 



The type is Sitta ncevia Gmelin; and the list of species is as 

 follows : 



Sclateria ncevia (Gmelin). 



Sclateria leucpstigma (Pelzeln). 



Sclateria saturata (Salvin). 



Sclateria argentata ( Des Mnrs). 



Sclateria hypoleuca (Ridgway). 



HOMORTJS Reichenbach. 



The generic name Homorus Reichenbach 1 is rendered untenable 

 by Homorus Albers, 2 a genus of Mollusca. The only other name 

 for this group is Pseudoseisura Reichenbach, 3 of which the type is 

 Anabates guMeralis d'Orbigny and Lafresnaye. 



The species are 



Pseudoseisura lophotes (Reichenbach). 



Pseudoseisura gutteralis (d'Orbigny and Lafresnaye). 



Pseudoseisura cristata (Spix). 



Pseudoseisura galathece (Leverkiihn). 



LIMNOPHYES Sclater. 

 The genus Liinnojjhyes Sclater 4 is preoccupied in Diptera by 

 Limnophyes Eaton, 6 and may be called Thryolegus, from Opoov, 

 juncus, and Hy<», lego. The type and only species is Idmnornis 

 eurvirostris Gould, which will therefore stand as 

 Thryolegus eurvirostris (Gould). 



OXYURUS Swainson. 



The usual reference to this name is Zoological Journal, iii, 1827, 

 p. 354, though here is nothing but a nomen nudum, no species 

 being mentioned. The correct citation seems to be Classification of 

 Birds, ii, 1838, p. 313. Oxyurus is, however, untenable in orni- 

 thology, by reason of Oxyurus Rafinesque 6 for a genus of fishes. 

 No other name being available, it may be known as Aphrastura,

from atppaaros, mirabilis, and uupd, cauda, the type being Mbtacilla 

 spinicauda Gmelin. 



The species are 



Aphrastura spinicauda (Gmelin). 



Aphrastura masafuerce (Philippi and Landbeck ). 



EROESSA Hartlaub. 



Eroessa Hartlaub 1 is preoccupied in Lepidoptera by Eroessa 

 Doubleday." Another name for the group, Dauria Polleu, 3 is also 

 unavailable on account of Dauria Dejean, 1834, for a genus of 

 Coleoptera. Neomixis Sharpe 4 must therefore be employed, the 

 type being Neomixis striatigula Sharpe. 



The species will thus stand as 



Neomixis tenella (Hartlaub). 



Neomixis viridis (Sharpe). 



Neomixis striatigula Sharpe. 



ELLISIA Hartlaub. 



The genus El/isia Hartlaub 5 must give way to Ellisia Forbes aud 

 Goodsir, 6 for a group of Polypi. As Thamnornis Milne-Edwards, 

 type chloropetoides, appears to be sufficiently distinct for generic 

 separation, a new name is necessary for the species of Ellisia 

 proper; and Nesillas, from vr^ao^, insula, and UXds, turdus, is pro- 

 posed, the type being Ellisia typica Hartlaub. 



The recognized forms are 



Nesillas typica (Hartlaub). 



Nesil/a-< typica ellisia (Schlegel). 



Nesillas typica lantzi (Grandidier). 



Nesillas typica longicavdata (Newton). 



Nesillas brevicaudata (Milne-Edwards and Oustalet). 



PHLEXIS Hartlaub. 



The generic term Phlexis Hartlaub 7 is preoccupied in Coleoptera 

 by Phlexys Erichson,' emended by Agassiz to Phlexis. It may be

replaced by Cryptillas, from xpuxros, occultus, and M.d$, turdus; 

 the type and sole species being Bradypterus victorini Sundevall. 

 This will now stand as 



Cryptillas victorini (Sundevall). 



AMYTIS Lesson. 



Amytis Lesson 1 is untenable by reason of Amytis Savigny, 2 pro- 

 posed for a genus of Vermes. In its stead may be used Diaphor- 

 illas, from didpopus, dirl'erens, and lAXd$ } turdus; the typical 

 species being Malurus textilis Quoy and Gaimard. 



The list of species is as follows : 

 Diaphorillas textilis (Quoy and Gaimard). 

 Diaphorillas striata (Gould). 

 Diaphorillas macroiira (Gould). 

 Diaphorillas goyderi (Gould). 



HEMIXUS Hodgson. 



In the sixth volume of the British Museum Catalogue of Birds, 

 pp. 120, 121, Dr. Sharpe treats at length the generic name Ixos 

 Temminck, 3 arriving finally at the conclusion that it is a synonym 

 of Pyenonotus, and that it must date from 1840. That this disposi- 

 tion of the name is not the proper one may at once be seen by refer- 

 ence to the original description in the text accompanying the 

 Planches Coloriees. Dr. Sharpe states that Temminck gives no 

 characters for the genus, but the following quotation will show that 

 this is not correct: " Je donne a ce groupe d'oiseaux un nom sys- 

 tematique, pour que les especes qui en font partie puissent etre 

 separe'es generiquement des Merles (Turdus), desquels on peut les 

 separer assez convenablement, par la brievete du bee en proportion 

 de la tete, par des ailes plus courtes, et par une plus grande abon- 

 dance de duvet sur le croupion, caractere tres marque dans quelques 

 unes." The only species given is Ixos virescem Temminck, which 

 must therefore be considered the type; and as this bird is not a 

 Pyenonotus, but a Hemixus, the generic name Ixos, 1825, must sup- 

 plant Hemixus Hodgson. 4

 Ixos castanonotus (Swinhoe). 

 Ixos connectens (Sharpe). 

 Ixos cinereus (Blyth). 

 Ixos malaccensis (Blyth). 

 Ixos virescens (Temminck). 

 Ixos canipennis (Seebohm). 

 Ixos suinatranus (Salvadori). 



CASSINIA Hartlaub. 



Ca-mniu Hartlaub 1 is preoccupied in Mollusca by Cassinia 



Rafinesque," and as no other name is available, may be called 

 Stizorhina, from errt^w, distinguo, and /-:'?, nasus, the type being 

 Muscicapa fraseri Strickland. 



The species are 



Stizorhina fraseri (Strickland). 



Stizorhina finschi (Sharpe). 



Stizorhina semipartita (Ruppell). 



Stizorhina zenkeri (Reichenow). 



PHILENTOMA Eyton. 



The generic name Philentoma Eyton 3 is not the earliest one for 

 the group to which it is applied, as Drymophila Temminck 4 is dis- 

 tinctly stated to have for its type Drymophila velata Temminck 

 (l. c. ), which is now a Philentoma. At first sight Drymophila 

 Temminck appears to be preoccupied by Drymophila Swainson, 

 1824, 5 but the latter is a nomen nudum, no species being mentioned; 

 and it was not properly characterized until the nest year, 6 later by 

 a few months than Drymophila Temminck, which thus becomes 

 available for Philentoma.

The species, therefore, should stand as 

 Drymophila velata (Temmiuck). 

 Drymop hila pyrrhoptera ( Temmiuck ) . 

 Drymophila dubia (Hartert). 



SYMMORPHUS Gould. 



The genus Symmorphus Gould 1 is preoccupied in Hymenoptera 

 by Symmorphus Wesmael,* and may be replaced by Diaphoropterus 

 (dtd(popo$ } differens, and Kzzpov, ala), its type being Symmorphus 

 leucopygus Gould. 



Muscicapa ncevia Gmelin, 3 which is Symmorphus ncevius, is unten- 

 able because of Muscicapa ncevia Boddaert, 4 a Myiobius. The cor- 

 rect name is montrosieri (Lalage montrosieri Verreaux and 

 Des Murs). 5 



The species of this genus are 



Diaphoropterus leucopygus (Gould). 



Diaphoropterus montrosieri (Verreaux and Des Murs). 



Diaphoropterus affinis (Tristram). 



XEROPHILA Gould. 



Xerophila Gould 6 must be displaced on account of Xerophila 

 Held, 7 a genus of Mollusca. In its place may be employed 

 Aphelocephala, from d^e^c, simplex, and xe<paXtj } caput, with 

 Xerophila leucopsis Gould as type. 



The species are as follows: 



Aphelocephala leucopsis (Gould). 



Ap helocep ha la pectoralis ( Gould ) . 



Aphelocephala nigrieineta (North). 



EUTHYRHYNCHUS Schlegel. 

 The name Euthyrhynehus Schlegel 8 is preoccupied in Hemiptera

Timeliopsis griseigula fluvigula (Schlegel). 



Timeliopsis fulvigula (Schlegel). 



Timeliopsis meyeri (Salvadori). 



Timeliopsis fulviventris ( Ramsey) . 



STICTOPTERA Reichenbach. 



The generic term Stictoptera Reichenbach 2 is untenable by reason 

 of Stictoptera Guenee,* for a group of Lepidoptera, and may be 

 replaced by Stizoptera, from tt{£u), noto, and -repdv, ala, the type 

 being Friagilla bichenovii Vigors and Horsfield. 



The species are 



Stizoptera bichenovii (Vigou's and Horsfield). 



Stizoptera annulosa (Gould). 



CHERA Gray. 



The genus Chera Gray 4 must give place to Chera Hiibner, 5 

 employed in Lepidoptera ; and it may be called Diatropura, from 

 didrpoitos, difFerens, and uhpd, cauda. The type and only species 

 is Emberiza procne Boddaert, which will now stand as 



Diatropura procne (Boddaert). 



EUCORYSTES Sclater. 



Eucorystes Sclater 6 is preoccupied in Crustacea by Eucoi-ystes 

 Bell. 7 In its stead may be used Zarhynchus, from £d, valde, and 

 liuy/tit, rostrum ; the type and sole representative being Cacicus

Lamprocorax maximus (Tristram). 



DILOPHUS Vieillot. 



Dilophus Vieillot 2 is untenable because of Dilophus Meigen, 3 for 

 a genus of Diptera. As no other name is available it may be called 

 Perissornis (izspiauos, mirabilis, opviq, avis), the type and sole 

 species being Graeula carunculata Gmelin, which will now stand as 



Perissornis carunculatus (Gmelin). 



CUPHOPTEKTJS Hartlaub. 



The genus Cuphopterus Hartlaub 4 is preoccupied in Hymenoptera 

 by Cuphopterus Morawitz, 5 and as there are no synonyms, it may 

 be called Horizorhinus from op'-C^, hmito, and peg, nasus. The

THERMOTROPIC MOVEMENT OF THE LEAVES OF 

 RHODODENDRON MAXIMUM L. 



BY JOHN W. HARSHBERGER, I'H.D. 



It is apparent from a number of recently published papers on the 

 reactions of protoplasm and, in particular, of various sensitive 

 plants to stimuli, that it will be necessary to reconstruct our views 

 to a considerable extent upon the subject of vegetable irrita- 

 bility. The movement of the chlorophyll granules in the cells 

 of leaves, exposed to too bright sunlight ; the movement of tendrils 

 in response to shocks, heat or the application of chemical substances, 

 show us that protoplasm reacts in essentially the same manner, 

 whatever plant is chosen for experimentation. 



The writer is not aware that any observations have ever been re- 

 corded on the movement of the leaves of Rhododendron ma.riiiuim, 

 yet the movements of this plant are quite definite. If observa- 

 tions upon this ericaceous shrub be made during cold weather (the 

 recent zero weather affording fine opportunities for such study), 

 it will be found that the leaves are all bent down closely against 

 the stem, and are rolled inward tightly in a convolute man- 

 ner, one edge slightly overlapping the other, so that the upper 

 epidermis is alone presented to the action of the weather (fig. 1). 

 To assume this position, the petiole takes a sharp bend downward 

 through an angle of about seventy degrees. The lower side of the 

 petiole is puckered into transverse folds, when the inrolled and 

 hanging position of the leaves is assumed. The acute apex as 

 shown in one of the lower leaves (fig. 1) is slightly incurved. The 

 U-shaped bend of the petiole is more marked in the lower leaves 

 than in the upper. The leaves assume an extremely deep green 

 color, of a brownish hue, and appear as if .frozen. Two objects 

 seem to be served by the hanging position of the leave- accompanied 

 by tbe folding of the lower surface of the blade, which is provided 

 with stomata, or transpiration openings. Firstly, the protection of 

 the lower surface of the leaf, thus ensuring the conservation of the 

 internal water of the plant. When the soil is hard frozen and the 




220 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [18!)!). 



days arc bright and crisply cold, with a breeze stirring, the plant 

 with broadly expanded leaves would transpire itself to death. 

 Kihlman 1 has clearly shown the action of a dry wind in frosty 

 weather on vegetation to he destructive in the extreme. Secondly, 

 the folding of the leaves and downward curvature facilitates the 

 rapid shedding of snow and ice, which in the mountains where this 

 plant grows cover the evergreen trees and bushes to a considerable 

 extent. During the recent zero weather, even in the most pro- 

 tected places where exposed to the bright sunlight, the drooping 

 condition of the leaves was constantly maintained. In the shade 

 of one of the University buildings, the infolding was even more 

 accentuated than in the sun, as one would naturally expect, and in 

 the mountains of Pennsylvania, in the shadow of the leafless trees 

 and evergreen hemlocks, the cold rigor of the plant was very 

 noticeable at a hundred yards' distance, viewed from the windows 

 of a rapidly moving train. 



If a branch of a plant with its leaves in the hanging position be 

 carried into a warm room at about the temperature of 75°-80° F. , 

 in response to this thermal stimulus the leaves will begin to unfold 

 and assume the diaheliotropic, or dorsiventral, position. The 

 following observations made upon the reactions to heat and cold 

 stimuli show that the movements are made quite rapidly: 



Branch 1. — Intervals of time given in minutes. 

 1.30 min. — Visible response to heat stimulus. 

 2.00 min. — Unfolding of leaf began. 

 3.00 min. — Leaf almost wholly unfolded and petiole erected through 



an angle of about 40°. 

 4.00 min. — Upper leaves become dorsiventral. 

 5.00 min. — Blade of leaves fully expanded, but the petiole not 

 yet entirely straight. 



Branch 2. — This branch was held over a radiator. It had been 

 cut for twenty-four hours and placed out of doors in the cold. 

 The record is as follows: 

 |-1 min. — Response to stimulus. 



1.30 min. — Somewhat jerky upward movement of the petiole 

 apparent.

3.00 mill. — Leaves assume a nearly horizontal position and the 



blade unfurled. 

 4.00 min. — Movement of one of the petioles still evident. 

 5.00 min. — Leaves assume the normal position. 



The main leader showed much quicker response than the laterals. 

 In removing this branch to the cold after it had assumed the 

 normal position in the heated room, it was found that the response 

 under the freezing temperature was not so rapid or marked as 

 when the shoot was moved from out of doors into a heated atmos- 

 phere. A slight response to the cold was evident in three minutes, 

 when the petiole began to curve slightly and the blade to roll. At 

 the end of five minutes, the larger leaves were well turned down 

 and rolled. At the end of ten minutes, the large leaves of one 

 of the shoots experimented upon had assumed the cold position.

 monstrate.

5 min. — Leaves fairly expanded, but the petiole has not re- 



sponded so quickly, as in the other experimental 

 branches. 



Fig. 3 illustrates a branch after it has assumed its normal dorsi- 

 ventral position. 



A cross-section of the leaf shows the following arrangement of 

 cells. There is a thick cuticle developed on the upper surface. 

 Beneath this there are two rows of epidermal cells; the upper row 

 has a thick external wall of cellulose. Beneath the epidermis, 

 there are several well-defined layers of palisade cells, and then 

 follow the loose parenchyma cells, more or less compacted together, 

 succeeded by the lower epidermis provided with stomata and multi- 

 cellular hairs, so disposed that they form a flat surface of inter- 

 locked branches as a protection against too rapid loss of internal 

 water. A striking feature of most of the cells, especially in the 

 upper epidermis, palisade tissue and loose parenchyma tissue, is 

 the intercellular communications, which are visible under ordinary 

 treatment and powers as depressions in the cell-wall. These are of 

 importance as part of the mechanism of movement. 



Research has shown that the movement in the leaves of Mimosa 

 rmdica L., M. sensitiva L., Oxalis bupleurifolia A. St. Hil., and 

 other sensitives, is brought about by the extrusion of water from 

 the pulvini into the contiguous stems and petioles, resulting in the 

 contraction of the pulvini. When the absorbing tissue of the 

 pulvini have again taken up water, and become tense and firm, 

 they will react again to new stimuli. The study of the cell struc- 

 ture of the leaf of Rhododendron maximum L. leads the writer to

believe that the transference of liquid from cell to cell, resulting in 

 the alternate rigidity of the upper and lower portions of the 

 petiole, has a very considerable bearing upon the resulting move- 

 ments. The movements are due to the gradual passage of sap 

 through the contractile protoplasmic sac of each cell into the inter- 

 cellular spaces, or they in all probability are due to the movement 

 of the liquid from cell to cell by means of the protoplasmic 

 bridges, so that one part of the leaf becomes highly turgescent and 

 the other part more or less flaccid. Cold weather, therefore, sets 

 the liquids in motion toward the upper side of the petiole and leaf. 

 The result of this motion of sap would be the downward flexure of 

 the leaf-stalk and the inward rolling of the leaf. When any 

 branch Avith hanging leaves i- brought into a heated room the 

 liquid is again conveyed to the cells lying near the lower surface 

 and the blade and petiole right themselves. That there is some 

 movement of cell-sap is evident on watching the change of color 

 of the leaves after they are brought indoors. In the cold they 

 are of a blackish green color, but on full expansion they assume 

 a brighter green, which becomes lighter as the temperature of the 

 surrounding air rises. 



Turgidity is then the main factor in the mechanism of these 

 movements; its mechanical importance is further strikingly illus- 

 trated by the great rigidity of the turgid members, and by the great 

 force, equivalent in parts of some plants to twenty times the atmos- 

 pheric pressure, which they develop in opposition to external 

 resistance, as when the roots of trees cause the splitting of walls 

 or pavements. Although one essential factor in turgidity is the 

 purelv physical osmotic activity of substances in the cell-sap, it 

 must not be forgotten that it also depends upon the resistance 

 offered by the protoplasm to filtration under pressure; so that the 

 maintenance of turgidity is after all a vital act. The maintenance 

 of turgidity appears, in fact, to depend upon a certain state of 

 molecular aggregation of the protoplasm lining the cell-wall, in 

 which it offers resistance to the escape of the cell sap; whereas in 

 the flaccid condition the state of molecular aggregation of the 

 protoplasm is such that it readily permits the escape of cell-sap, 

 under the elastic pressure of the cell-wall, either into the inter- 

 cellular spaces or through the protoplasmic bridges into adjoining 

 cells, which thus become more turgid.

That evergreen plants, such as Rhododendron maximum, have an 

 immense advantage in the struggle for existence goes without 

 saying. The fact that a plant can transpire, can metabolize food, 

 can respire and conduct the elaborated material during the cold of 

 winter is of very considerable biological significance. Other trees 

 and shrubs are practically dormant during the cold of the winter 

 months. They must develop and vegetate during the warmer 

 months of the year, while Rhododendron maximum is ready, as our 

 experiments go to prove, to avail itself of all the passing atmos- 

 pheric and meteorological conditions, whether of winter or summer, 

 which are favorable to its growth.

Relations of the Land Molluscan Fauna of South America. — 

 Mr. H. A. Pilsbry spoke of the extrinsic relation.- of the land 

 molluscan fauna of South America, recounting and commenting 

 upon the various theories advanced to account for the relations 

 existing between the South American, African and Australo- 

 Zealandic faunas. The evidence of former Austral land connecting 

 South America with Australasia derived from a study of the 

 Bulunulidce, the Macroogona, etc., was detailed The speaker 

 gave his reasons for preferring the hypothesis of a former extension 

 of Antarctic land to that of a South Pacific continent, as ad- 

 vocated by Prof. Hutton 1 and some others. He claimed that the 

 present fauna of southern Polynesia was not consistent with Hut- 

 ton's supposition that these islands had been submerged and thus 

 their fauna destroyed on the sinking of the supposed Pacific con- 

 tinent entirely below the sea, the present " islands being merely 

 outgrowths ou its submerged back." Some Polynesian groups, 

 such as Paftula, belong to very primitive and therefore ancient 

 groups, unknown in any other area, and indicating great antiquity 

 for the Polynesian archipelagoes 2 Neither is the present fauna of 

 Polynesia consistent with the hypothesis that these islands are unsub- 

 merged remnants of a Pacific continent. 



The enigmatic relations of the fresh-water fishes, snails, and 

 the terrestrial Streptaxidai of tropical South America with the 

 African fauna were discussed. 



The speaker considered the neotropical region of Wallace to be 

 composite, the Antillean and southern Mexican area representing 

 a tract independent from North and South America in Mesozoic and 

 perhaps earlier time, on which the fauna] problems had been inde- 

 pendently worked out. 



Various questions bearing on the communication were discussed 

 by Dr. Calvert, Prof. Cockerell and Dr. Sharp.

2 Partula, like the allied Aehatinella of the Hawaiian group, has a bottle- 

 shaped kidney with direct, not reflexed, ureter, as in Limrum. These forms 

 have no relations with the Bidimulidm and Achatinidce, with which con- 

 chologists associate them, but lie at the base of the terrestrial pnlmooate

NEUROPTEROUS INSECTS COLLECTED BY DR. A. DONALDSON SMITH IN 

 NORTHEASTERN AFRICA. 



BY PHILIP P. CALVERT, PH.D. 



Dr. A. Donaldson Smith, of Philadelphia, in his expedition 

 through Somaliland and Gallaland to Lake Rudolph, collected 

 some Neuroptera -which he presented to the Academy of Natural 

 Sciences of Philadelphia. These, some twenty-seven specimens, 

 embrace thirteen species of Odonata, three of Planipennia, and 

 one Termite; among them are two new species and one new genus 

 of Odonata. This fact, together with the very slight information 

 hitherto existing on the fauna of the region, justifies the publica- 

 tion of the present paper. 



Dr. Smith has published a narrative 1 of his journey, accom- 

 panied by excellent maps, and since his Neuroptera are individ- 

 ually labelled and dated, it is possible, by reference to his book, to 

 determine exactly the geographical positions and the elevations of 

 the localities whence his specimens came. The care thus taken to 

 record precise information deserves special mention, since not all 

 recent travellers, in Africa or elsewhere, have been so painstaking. 



Dr. Smith left Berbera, on the Gulf of Aden, July 10, 1894 ; 

 reached Lake Rudolph in July, 1895; thence turned southeast - 

 wardly to the Tana river and Lamu on the Indian Ocean, at which 

 latter he arrived about October 26, 1895. His Neuroptera were 

 collected at the following places: 



Berbera, on the Gulf of Aden, Onychogomphus sp., Hemianax 

 ephippiger, Orocothemis erythrcea, Orthetrum bracldale and 0.

 October 15, while on October 26 he was fifty miles farther south.

ODONATA. 

 1. Enallagma'? sp. 



One male from Sheikh Husein, September 29, 1894, has lost 

 the last seven abdominal segments, so that a positive identification 

 is at present impossible, but the remaining parts seem to indicate a 

 relationship to such species as glaucum Burm. (gabonense Selys). 

 The following descriptive notes are added to permit of future 

 identification. 



Frons, genre, nasus, lips and rear of head pale green; rhinarium 

 pale brown, vertex black from eye to eye, the site of the usual 

 postocular spots is green confluent with the same color of the rear 

 of the head. 



Prothorax green on either side, and a middorsal black band half 

 as wide as the prothorax itself. 



Thorax pale green, a middorsal and a humeral stripe black, the 

 latter half as wide as the pale antehumeral stripe, the former twice 

 as wide as the pale antehumeral stripe; a short, narrow, black stripe 

 at the upper end of the second lateral suture. 



Femora pale green with an external (superior) black stripe. 

 Tibiae and tarsi yellowish, the former with an external (anterior; 

 black line in their proximal halves. 



Abdomen pale bluish-green, an uninterrupted middorsal black 

 stripe on 1-3, widened and then suddenly narrowed before the apex 

 of 2, narrowed at the base of 3. 



Wings with the inferior sector of the triangle arising at least as 

 far in front of the submedian cross-vein as the latter is long, 

 quadrilateral with its upper side one-third as long as the loAver side 

 on the front wings, onedialf on the hind wings, three antenodal 

 cells, eleven postnodals on the front wings, ten on the hind wings, 

 nodal sector arising near the fifth postnodal, ultranodal sector at 

 the eighth. Pterostigma surmounting less than one cell ; on the 

 front wings black, with the lower and outer sides nearly equal; 

 ou the hind wings smaller, ochre, with the outer side distinctly 

 longer than the lower. 



Length of head, thorax and first three abdominal segments 12.5 

 mm., hind wing 19 mm. 



The dinerence in the pterostigmata of the front and hind wings 

 suggests Ischnura, but I notice something similar, although less 

 marked, in a male of glaucum Burm. (gabonense Selys). 






1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 231 



An apparently teneral female from Sheikh Husein, October 16, 

 1894, is probably of the same species as the above-described male; 

 the last four and a half segments are wanting, and the specimen is 

 otherwise in poor condition. The pale green of the male is replaced 

 by pale luteous throughout. The black on the prothorax is but 

 faintly indicated. The black humeral stripe is but a line, the 

 middorsal stripe is narrower, so that it is hardly wider than the 

 pale antehumeral, and it is bisected lengthwise by the middorsal 

 carina being luteous. The two legs which remain (a first and a 

 second) are pale yellowish. The left front wing has twelve post- 

 nodals, the ultranodal sector rises at the ninth postnodal on all wings 

 except the left hind. The pterostigma is very pale luteous on all 

 wings, slightly Hiialler on the hind than on the front. 



Length of head, thorax and first five abdominal segments 23 

 mm., hind wing 19 mm. 



2. Onychogomphus sp. 



One female, Berbera, July 5, 1894. 



The females, at least of such East African species of Onycho- 

 gomphus as Genei, Hageni, pumilio, Qostaz, obliteratus and lacustris, 



are difficult to identify from the descriptions in the absence of any 

 specimens of this group. It seems possible that some of the differ- 

 ences indicated as specific may be due to age and to imperfect 

 knowledge owing to the relatively few individuals examined. 

 This being the case, I think it likely that this female from Berbera 

 may be one of the species already described, in spite of the fact 

 that it differs more or less from the descriptions. I prefer, there- 

 fore, not to give it any specific name, but to add notes which may 

 facilitate its future identification. 



Face and lips very pale yellowish, perhaps somewhat greenish in 

 life, unmarked with black. Upper surface of frons pale yellow 

 with a narrow basal brown line at the base of the vertex, and a 

 group of 10-12 black denticles on either side at its front margin. 

 Vertex yellowish, ocelli and the area between them and the antenna 

 (except the first joint) blackish. Occiput luteous, its hind margin 

 armed with 16 black denticles. 



Prothorax luteous. Thorax pale greenish-yellow, dorsum almost 

 immaculate except for the trace of a pale brown antehumeral 

 stripe ; the humeral and the second lateral suture each with a 




232 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF |_1899. 



complete brown stripe and a short brown stripe on the site of the 

 first lateral suture from the metastigma downward, where it joins 

 that of the first lateral suture. 



Legs pale green, femora with a superior pale brown stripe, first 

 and second tibia? with one (anterior) brown line, third tibiae with 

 two (anterior and posterior) tarsi brownish. Thes pines on all 

 parts of the legs blackish. 



Abdomen greenish yellow, a middorsal brown line on the basal 

 third of 3-6, the articulations and the supplementary transverse 

 carina (or suture) of 2-7 blackish, an inferior brown spot on 

 either side of 3-6 in front of the supplementary carina and more 

 or less confluent with it, an inferior apical brown stripe on either 

 side of 2-7 which reaches forward to the supplementary carina on 

 2-4, a double middorsal apical brown spot on 5-7, a brown stripe 

 on either side of 8 meeting its fellow of the opposite side both at 

 base and at apex, narrow transverse basal and apical brown stripes 

 on 9. 



Eighth and ninth abdominal segments not at all dilated. Vul- 

 var lamina brown, its emargination subquadrate. Appendages as 

 long as 9, twice as long as 10, straight, slender, tapering, luteous, 

 apical sixtli brown. Eleventh segment (" anal tubercle ") a little 

 longer than 10, when viewed from above luteous. 



Wings: reticulation mostly black or dark brown, except the 

 yellow costa. Front wings with 12 (right), 13 (left) antenodals, 

 8 postnodals. Hind wings with 10 antenodals, 8 postnodals. First 

 and fifth antenodals thicker. No basal subcostal cross-veins. 

 Pterostigma pale yellow enclosed by thickened veins, surmounting 

 4—5 cells on the different wings. Membranule small, white. 



Abdomen 32 mm., its appendages 1.5 mm., hind wing 27, pter- 

 ostigma 3.5. 



This female seems to have too much black on the abdomen to be 

 Genci, Costa-, or Hagtni, or perhaps even lacustris, and in this and 

 other respects seems to resemble obliteratus, but this last has the 

 pterostigma black. Ph mi fin is smaller and is differently propor- 

 tioned in some of its parts. In addition to the older literature, 

 Mr. McLachlan's paper in the Entomologists' Monthly Magazine 

 for Julv, 1897, is to be consulted.

5. Palpopleura Portia Drury. 



One male, "Smith river, Sept. 11, 1894, F. G." [= Fred. 

 Gillette ?] is nearest Portia, but the dark brown coloring on the 

 front wings does not reach the hind margin at any point, instead 

 of occupying the entire width of the wing in its basal fourth, as 

 in Drury's figure. 



6. Trithemis ardens Gerstaecker. 



Gerst , Mitt. Naturh. Mas. Hamburg, ix, p. 5, 1891. 



One male, Stony brook, August 17, 1894. 



In this individual there are. on the front wings, four posttrian- 

 gular cells, then three rows to beyond the level of the nodus. 



This species was originally described from Mbusini. I possess 

 also a male from Abyssinia, given me at the Konigliche Museum 

 fiir Naturkunde, which I compared with the type of T. Marnois, 

 Brauer ( Verhd. zoo/, hot. Gesel. Wien, xviii, p. 735, 1868, no 

 description; see also de Borre, Repertoire Alphabetique, etc., p. 26) 

 " aus Setith.," and found the two to be identical. Dr. Karsch 

 (Berl. Ent. Zeit., xxviii, p. 24, 1893) has held ardens to be the 

 same as sanguinolenta Burm., but they are quite distinct, as may 

 be seen by comparing my description (Trans. Am. Ent. Soc, xxv, 

 p. 90, 1898) of Burmeister's types with Gerstrecker's description; 

 it may be added that the supplementary sector next below the 

 subnodal is so strongly convex posteriorly that two rows of cells 

 exist between it and the subnodal sector in ardens, instead of one 

 row as in sanguinolenta. 



Mr. Kirby suggests (Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., 7, ii. p. 233, 1898) 

 that " T. ardens Gerstaecker is, perhaps, a form of this species 

 [i.e., T. lacustris Kirby] with blacker legs." A. comparison of 

 the original descriptions accompanying the two names shows the 

 following- differences :

The above-quoted males are more like ardens than lacustris, 

 although somewhat smaller and with slightly fewer antenodals 

 than the former. Grerstaecker's description being briefer than Mr. 

 Kirby" s, it is not possible to determine whether the following 

 features, in which these two males from Stony brook and from 

 Abyssinia differ from lacustris, also exist in the typical ardt ns : 

 front wings with internal triangle three-celled (instead of two), 

 hind wings with 8-12 postnodals, three or four posttriangular 

 cells, then two rows for two cells, then three rows increasing. It 

 may be noted that Mr. Kirby (1898, I. c.) cites lacustris from 

 Pretoria and Zoutpansberg in the Transvaal, from Wadelai and 

 from Abyssinia.

One of the three males from Berbera has the triangle of the 

 hind wings crossed by one vein, and five rows of cells between the 

 principal and nodal sectors at the level of the inner end of the 

 pterostigma; these are two of the characters given as distinguishing 

 C. divisa Baumann (Eat. Nach., xxiv, p. 342, 1898), a West 

 African species, from erythrcea. On the other hand, the body is 

 no more slender and the amount of yellow coloring at the base of 

 the hind wings no less than in the other two Berbera males, which 

 have the triangle of the hind wings free, and one of which has 

 five rows, the other four rows of cells between principal and nodal 

 sectors at the level of the inner end of the pterostigma. It seems 

 very doubtful, therefore, that divisa is a distinct species. 



It may here also be remarked that, on the page quoted from 

 Baumann' s paper, it is stated that " ferrugaria Ramb., Calv. ," is 

 the female of erythrcea. I pointed out the differences between the 

 two in Proc. U. S. Nat. Mm., xviii, p. 127, 1896, and subse- 

 quently showed ferrugaria to be a synonym of sanguinolenta Burin. 

 (Trans. Am. Ent. Soc, xxv, p. 91, 1898).

One male, Stony brook, August 17, 1894. 



tf. — Dull bluish black except in those parts noted below. Ver- 

 tex and most of the frons metallic violet, the lateral and inferior 

 margins of the latter pale brown. ISasus blackish brown, darker 

 in the middle. Rhinarium pale olive. Labruin shining black. 

 Labium yellow, median lobe and inner halves of the lateral lobes 

 black. Occiput black above, orange edged with black behind. 

 Rear of the eyes black and yellow. Mesepisternum and meta- 

 pleuron with some very indistinct, yellowish spots and stripes. 

 Posterior half of metasternum black with a pair of bright yellow 

 spots close to the median line. Coxre and trochanters obscure 

 brownish. Sides of first three abdominal segments pale brown, 

 evidently much faded. It seems quite likely that in life there was 

 a longitudinal yellow or brown streak on each side of the dorsum 

 of 3-7, now almost completely faded. 



Eyes meeting for a distance a little less than the antero -posterior 

 middorsal dimension of the occiput. Tip of the vertex barely 

 concave in outline when viewed from in front. Face clothed with 

 black hairs, most numerous on frons and vertex. Frons without

 coincides with a more or less angular crest, best marked on the 

 anterior surface. Hind lobe of the prothorax much smaller than 

 the middle lobe, its hind margin entire. 



Spines on all the femora directed toward the knee, 6 on the first, 

 9-12 on the second, 20-18 on the third; the spines on the third 

 femora are shorter than the intervals separating them and notice- 

 ably shorter than the spines on the first or second femora; all these 

 spines are of the antero-iuferior (or outer) row, the postero-infe- 

 rior row being composed of more numerous, slender hairs. Third 

 tibiae with 12 anteroinferior (outer), 15 postero-inferior (inner) 

 spines, longer than the intervals separating them. Claws of all 

 the tarsi with the tooth distinctly shorter than the tip of the nail 

 itself. 



Abdomen, viewed from above, widest at 2 and at 0, slightly nar- 

 rower at 3 and at 10. Genitalia of 2 quite prominent, especially 

 the hamule which is entire, sickle-shaped, resembling, but more 

 robust than, that of Macrothemis, Anterior lamina but little less 

 prominent; viewed in profile, convex and polished in front, nearly 

 plane behind; seen from behind its apical fifth is "very distinctly 

 bifid so as to show two tapering, rounded tips. Genital lobe at least 

 half shorter than the hamule, oblong, apex rounded. 



Superior appendages as long as 9, of the usual Libelluline form, 

 with an inferior row of 8-10 denticles. Inferior appendage about 

 one-seventh shorter, triangular, reaching beyond the denticles of 

 the superiors. 



Wings slightly smoky, milky at base to the arculus on the front 

 wings, to the triangle on the hind wings. Pterostigma dark 

 brown. Membranule pale brown, white at extreme base. Reticu- 

 lation throughout blackish ; nodal sector distinctly waved ; two 

 rows of cells between the subnodal sector and the next supplement- 

 ary sector below; one submedian cross-vein; arculus between the 

 first and second antenodals.

triangles free, its basal side a little nearer than the arculus, 3 post- 

 triangular cells, then 2 rows for 2 to 3 cells, then three rows 

 increasing to 13-14 marginal cells. 



Total length 43 mm., abdomen 29, sup. app. 2, third femur 6, 

 hind wing 35, pterostigma 3. 



This species is very similar to P. torrida Kirby ( Trans. Zoo I. 

 Soc. Loud., xii, p. 340, pi. Hi, f. 7, 1889), which, however, is 

 larger, having the total length of the body 58 mm., the wing 

 expanse 100 mm., the pterostigma 5 mm., no milky color at the 

 wing bases (at least none is mentioned in the description or shown 

 in the figure), and the membrauule white, while in spite of its 

 larger size torrida has fewer antenodals and postnodals than Don- 

 aldsoni.

 two cells. Anterior lamina not as prominent as internal hamular 

 branch. Sectors of the triangle of the hind wings arising from the 

 same point. 



Variety ? 



One male, Walenso, October 2(3, 1894. Differs from the type- 

 form in having but one row of cells throughout the entire area 

 between the subuodal sector and the supplementary sector next 

 below. In three males from Kilimanjaro, by Dr. Abbott, 5 which 

 I still have before me, this area consists of one row of cells through- 

 out in six out of the twelve wings, while in the other six wings, 

 one or more of which belong to each of the three individuals, 

 there are one or two double cells inserted near the middle. This 

 variety is therefore hardly worthy of a distinctive name.

Falls here by my key, /. c, 1898, p. 95. I note, however, on 

 the side of the thorax, in addition to the stripes described for 

 brackiale (= contradum Kamb. ) on p. 130, Proc. U. S. Nat. 

 Mas., xviii, a blackish stripe running through the spiracle (meta- 

 stigma), and a similar one on the metepimeron parallel to and 

 behind the second lateral suture and confluent, at its lower end, 

 with the blackish color along the latero-ventral metathoracic carina ; 

 neither of these stripes reaches to the base of the wings. There 

 are therefore six dark stripes on either side of the thorax, counting 

 the antehumeral as one. A similar number and arrangement of 

 stripes exists in a male from West Africa, given me by Mr. 

 McLachlan, but which from the black color of the antenodals and 

 other cross-veins should be contraction ; this male is not at all 

 pruinose, and its colors are in excellent preservation.

 following respects:

Mr. McLachlan draws the conclusion (7. c. ), "the two forms 

 are not only distinct as species, but will probably eventually be 

 placed in two different genera." 



It is consequently of interest to note that the present male from 

 Berbera agrees with Sabina in characters Nos. 1 and 2, with 

 africana in Xo. 3. The distance between the origins of the two 

 sectors of the triangle is about .5 mm., therefore the same as in 

 Sabina; no trace of the hairs exists on the anterior lamina, whose 

 anterior surface, moreover, is yellow instead of blackish as in the 

 Asiatic males of Sabina which I have examined. 



The female from Berbera has the labrum pale yellowish, the 

 sectors of the triangle separated at their origin by a distance of 

 .2-. 3 mm., therefore less than in Sabina, the black line on the 

 frons bordering the vertex and eyes is narrower than in Sabina, 

 and the seventh abdominal segment has a large yellow spot on 

 either side, at its middle, similar to the pair on 6. 

 12. Sympetrum Fonscolombii Selys. 



One male, Sheikh Husein, September 29, 1894. 



HEMISTIGMOIDES new genus. 



(1) Vertex truncated at tip. (2) Frons with its upper surface 

 sloping downward and forward from the vertex meeting its anterior 

 surface at an angle of about 115°, the line of junction of these 

 two surfaces being marked by a well-defined carina, (3) no lateral 

 or other carina?. (4) Eyes in contact for a distance nearly equal 

 to the middorsal length of the occiput. 



(5) Hind lobe of the prothorax of equal width with the middle 

 lobe, (6) its hind margin with a shallow median concavity and 

 thus being slightly bilobed.

 13 /> 18; (-?i) tarsal nails with the usual inferior tooth acute, 

 much shorter than the tip of the nail itself. 



All wings: (12) arculus between the first and the second ante- 

 nodals, (IS) one submedian cross-vein, (H.) nodal sector very 

 slightly waved, (15) at least some double cells between the sub- 

 nodal sector and the supplementary sector next below, (16) one to 

 three cross-veins between the median vein and the principal sector 

 from the origin of the subnodal sector to the nodus, (17) discoidal 

 triangles with one cross-vein. 



Front wings: (IS) last antenodal not continued to the median 

 vein, (19) sectors of the arculus arising by a very short common 

 stalk equal in length to the lower division of the arculus (i. e. , that 

 part of the arculus from the origin of the stalk to the submedian 

 vein), (20) one hypertrigonal, (21) triangle with its basal side 

 twice as long as its anterior side, (22) internal triangle of three 

 cells, (23) four posttriangular cells, then three rows to the level of 

 the last antenodal, thence increasing, (21f) submedian space reach-

 the level of the fourth antenodal of the hind wings), (28) triangle

 (Kirby) start from the postcostal vein. 



(32) Genitalia of second abdominal segment of male not promi- 

 nent, (33) hamule bifid at tip only. 



" The insect for which this genus is established has a great super- 

 ficial resemblance to the African Hemistigma, Kirby, a fact which 

 has suggested the name here proposed. From Hemistigma, Hem- 

 istigmoides differs by the characters above numbered 1, 2, 5, 8, 15 

 (except in one wing out of twenty-four wings of Hemistigma 

 studied for this purpose), 17 (for the hind wings), 19 and 27. It 

 may be added here that two males, three females of Hemistigma 

 affirm Ramb. have the arculus at the second antenodal (compare 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 241 



No. 12 above), while one male of qffinia has it slightly nearer the 

 hase of the wing than the second antenodal is. Further, although 

 Mr. Kirby states in his original characterization of Hemistigma 

 {Trans. Zool. >Soc. Lund., xii, p. 295, 1889) that the abdomen is 

 "as long as the hind wings in the male," all three males of H. affinis 

 just quoted have the abdomen shorter than the hind wing. 



The genus Bradinopyga Kirby (Journ. Linn. Soe. Lond. Zool., 

 xxiv, p. 553, 1894), from Ceylon, is compared by its author to 

 Hemistigma. Hemistigmoides diners from Bradinopyga in the 

 characters above numbered 5, 16, 17 (for the hind wings), 19, 

 20, 27 and 30. 6 



In Dr. Karsch's arrangement of the genera of the Libellulinse 

 (Berl. Ent. Zeit., xxxiii, p. 356, 1890), Hemistigmoides would 

 fall in the same section as Perithemis. It differs from Perithemis, 

 however, by the characters above numbered 16, 20, 21, 2J+, 25 

 and 27. 



13. Hemistigmoides deceptor n. sp. (PI. X, fig. 4.) 



One male, Sheikh Husein, September 29, 1894. 



cT. — Vertex brown, its tip with a small metallic dark green 

 spot. Upper surface of frons dark metallic blue-green,, sides and 

 anterior surface and the clypeus pale green. Labrum yellow, nar- 

 rowly edged with black at the middle of the front margin. Labium 

 yellow, a median line on the middle lobe and the inner edges of 

 the lateral lobes dask brown. Occiput brown. 



Prothorax dull blackish, middle lobe wilh a median twin spot 

 and a small lateral spot — pale. Thoracic dorsum obscurely mottled 

 with green and brown. Sides pale green with blackish brown 

 stripes on the first (obsolete) and second lateral sutures, confluent 

 below with the mostly dark pectus; this last has a pair of spots and 

 behind them a transverse streak — all green — on the metasternum. 



6 The structure of the prothorax of Bradinopyga is not mentioned by Mr. 

 Kirby ; his description states that the sectors of the triangle of the hind 

 wings are separated at base, while his figure (?. c, PL 41, f. 3) of B. stigmata 

 Kirby shows them arising from the same point. Mr. Kirby has kindly 

 informed me on both of these structures, by letter dated March 30, 1899, 

 as follows: "In Bradinopyga the sectors of the triangle are distinctly 

 separated, but not for more than a comparatively short space, which varies. 

 In the type, the prothorax is not properly visible ; but in a second specimen 

 it seems to be shaped something like this : [here a sketch] i. e., quadrilo- 

 bate. the two central lobes sloping down on the sides, and the hind one not 

 'Helled and considerably smaller."

Abdomen blackish, sides of 1-3 with some pale green, of 4-9 with 

 a small indistinct yellowish -brown streak close to the lateral carinse. 

 Genitalia of 2 inconspicuous; anterior lamina very slightly devel- 

 oped, its margin entire; hamule bifid at the extreme tip only, the 

 anterior (inner) branch apparently hooked; genital lobe a little 

 more prominent than the hamule, a little longer than wide, its tip 

 regularly rounded. 



Terminal abdominal appendages black ; superiors about as long 

 as 9 + 10, slender, thickest at four-fifths their length, with some

PLANIPENNIA. 

 Palpares sp. No. 1. (Plate X, fig. 1.) 



One male, Lainmo (Lummo ?), August 12, 1894, is very close 

 to tristis Hag., but diners (a) in having the subbasal spot on the 

 hind wings, a spot which is lacking in tristis, and (6) in the form 

 of the subbasal spot on the front wings. In (a) it resembles var. 

 niansanus Kolbe (Deut. Ost. Afrika, iv, Netzflugler, p. 9, 1898), 

 but differs therefrom in the greater extent of the second and third 

 bands (Querbinde) of the hind wings; it is also larger than 

 niansanus. 

 Palpares sp. No. 2. (Plate X, fig. 2.) 



One female, The Haud, July 24, 1894, resembles Kolbe' s figure 

 (I. c, f. 6) of nyicanus and McLachlan's description (Journ. Linn. 

 Soc. ZooL, ix, p. 240, 1868) of sparsus. 

 Palpares sp. No. 3. (Plate X, fig. 3. ) 



One female [Boran country], April 8, 1895, related to Stuhl- 

 manni Kolbe (I. c, p. 12 and f. 1), and resembling digitatus 

 Gerstsecker (Mitth. Ver. Vorpomm., xxv, p. 117, 1894) in the 

 markings of the hind wings. 



Not having access to any other specimens of Palpares, and being 

 therefore unable to appreciate the amount of individual variation 

 which may occur in this genus, I have thought it preferable to 

 designate these species as above, rather than to attach names to 

 them, probably incorrectly. 



The accompanying plate, from photographs which I owe to the 

 kindness of Dr. Henry Skinner, will, it is hoped, enable students 

 more favorably situated to exactly determine these Palpares.

PARALLELISMS IN STRUCTURE BETWEEN CERTAIN GENERA OF 

 ODONATA FROM THE OLD AND THE NEW WORLDS. 



BY PHILIP P. CALVERT, PH.D. 



The African genus Pseudomaeromia Kirby has been compared 

 by Dr. Karsch 3 with the neotropical Macrothemis Hagen. In the 

 identification of the species of Pseudomaeromia (P. Donaldsoni n. 

 sp. ), described in the preceding paper, I have studied the other 

 species of this genus, as well as those of the genera Zygonyx Selys 

 and Schizonyx Karsch, chiefly with the view of learning to what 

 extent these three Old World groups parallel, in their structure, the 

 New World Macrothemis and its allies. As a basis for this com- 

 parison I have used a recent paper, 2 in which I have shown that 

 the five American genera Dythemis, Paltothemis, Scapanea, Brech- 

 morhoga and Macrothemis form a group (of the subfamily Libel- 

 lulime), the chief peculiarity of which is " the modification of the 

 armature of the second and third femora in the males, and of the 

 tarsal nails in both sexes," the details of the modification being 

 characteristic for each genus, Dythemis being the least modified, 

 Macrothemis the most modified of the five. 



The reason for the comparison of Schizonyx, Pseudomaeromia 

 and Zygonyx with' Macrothemis, etc., is that they show similar 

 modification of the femoral armature and of the tarsal nails. 



The following species are referred to these three genera respec- 

 tively : 



To Schizonyx Karsch, luctifera Selys (type of the genus); 



To Psendomacromia Kirby, torrida Kirby (type of the genus), 

 Donaldsoni Calvert, hovct Rambur, speciosa Karsch and pretiosa 

 Karsch; 3

ciosa and pretiosa, described from male and female respectively, are 

 perhaps one and the same species, for Mr. McLachlan writes me, under date 

 of March 3, 1899: " I come round to the opinion that these are probably 




246 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES. [1899. 



To Zygomjx Selys, ida Selys (type of the genus) and iris Selys. 



In order that the structure of these species may be compared 

 most readily with that of their American analogues, the following 

 tabular form, used on pages 303 and 304 of my Macrothemis paper, 

 is also employed here : — 



$ 9 of one species, but the spining of the legs is considerably different." 

 A difference in the same parts of the two sexes is found in Macrothemis. 



Ps. luxuriosa Karsch was later stated by him to be a synonym of Zygonyx 

 ida Selys (Ent. Nach., xxi, p. 203). Tyriobapta Kirby, placed by its 

 author (Trans. Zool. Soc. Lond., xii, p. 262) next to Macrothemis, has, I 

 believe, nothiDg to do with the genera here considered.

Remarks on the preceding table — Characters 14 and 15, which 

 have no corresponding entries in the table in the Macrothemis paper 

 quoted, show some differences of these species from the " Common 

 characters of the Genera" Dythemis, etc., listed on p. 301, I.e. 

 In all other respects that list of Common Characters is to be under- 

 stood t<> apply to the sj)ecies here tabulated, although occasional indi- 

 vidual variations exist. Thus, I noted that the last antenodal on 

 one front wing of one female Z. ida was continued to the median 

 vein; Baron de Selys has a similar note for Z. iris; Mr. Kirby 

 mentions the existence of one hypertrigonal (supratri angular) 

 vein in one wing of one male Pseudomacromla torrida. 

 Schizonyx. 



The data given for «S'. luctifera in the table are based on per- 

 sonal examination at various times of seven males, two females. 

 9* is crossed in one wing of two males, 11 is 1-2-celled in 

 three males, 12 sometimes begins with three cells or is inter- 

 rupted by three cells, 13 in some begins with three cells. For 

 bibliography of luctifera see Proe. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1898, 

 p. 146. Schizonyx differs from Pseudomacromia and Zygonyx not 

 only in some of the characters tabulated, but also in having a 

 slight enlargement on the posterior margin of the eye, such as is 

 found in the Cordulina 1 , and in its pterostigma being shorter on 

 the hind wings than on the front wings. 

 Pseudomacromia torrida Kirby. 



The data given in the table and those which follow on variations 

 are derived entirely from Mr. Kirby' s descriptions and figure 

 (Trans. Zool. Soc. Lond., xii, p. 262, 299, 340, pi. lii, f. 7). 

 As Ps. Donaldsoni so closely resembles torrida in other respects, 

 it will probably be found that the few data lacking for torrida are 

 as in Donaldsoni. As to the variations of torrida — 8. two cross- 

 veins in one wing out of twenty-four wings; 10. crossed in two 

 wings out of twelve; 11. four-celled in three wings out of twelve. 

 Pseudomacromia nova. 



Libellula hova Rambur, Nivr., p. 92, 1842, doubtfully referred 

 to Onychothemis by Mr. Kirby {Cat. Odon., p. 24, 1890), was 

 placed with Pseudomacromia by Dr. Karsch (Berl. Ent. Zeit., 

 xxxiii, p. 369, 1890; xxviii, p. 21, 1893). 



1 These numbers refer to the numbered characters of the table. 




1899.] NATURAL BCTENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 251 



I examined Rambur's type, now in the University Museum, 

 Oxford, England, September 3, 1896, and made some notes upon 

 its venation, some of which are incorporated in the above table, 

 while the others follow here: 



Front wings with 10 (right), 11 (left) antenodals, the last one 

 not continued to the median vein, 7 postnodals. Hind wings with 

 7 antenodals, 8 postnodals, inner (basal) side of the triangle a 

 little nearer than the arculus with which, if produced, it would form 

 a small angle; two or three posttriangular rows, rather irregular and 

 not symmetrically developed on right and left wings. Total length 

 of body 47 mm., abdomen 32, front wing 38, pterostigma 3.5. 



The data given for horn in the table are based on the type male 

 and on a male from Xossi-Be, Madagascar coast, given me by 

 Baron de Selys-Longchamps. 



Pseudomacromia speciosa | -" | and pretiosa ( 2 ). 



The data given for characters 3, 6-13, are drawn from Dr. 

 Karsch's and Mr. McLachlan's descriptions and figure (Ent. 

 Nach., xvii, pp. 73, 74, taf. ii, 1891, 1 ;", 1 1 ; Ent. Mo. Mag. 2, 

 ii, p. Ill, 1891, 2 -J, l:). 'For Xos. 1-3. 5 and 6 I am also 

 indebted to a letter from Mr. McLachlan, in which he expresses 

 his opinion, already quoted, that these two nominal species are 

 really one. 



Variations of speciosa : 8. Of the three males known, one has 

 two submedian cross-veins in both hind wings (McLachlan, 

 /. c. ). 10. Dr. Karsch mentions that it is free on the left wing 

 of the male he examined. 



Variations of pretiosa : 6. Mr. McLachlan in his letter writes, 

 " one or two asymmetrical double cellules in the posterior wings." 

 8. Dr. Karsch mentions two on the left front wing of his type., 

 Mr. McLachlan three on the right hind wing of his specimen. 



The species of Pseudomacromia fall into two groups as regards 

 the tarsal nails; one (see the table, character No. 3) comprising 

 torrida and Donaldsoni, the other hova and speciosa (with pretiosa 

 as 9). Hova differs from speciosa in character No. 2, and perhaps 

 also in its superior appendages, " munis en dessous et un peu 

 lateralement, a l'*endroit de leur epaisseur, d'une pointe tres- 

 courte" (Rambur), a point easily seen in the male I possess. Ps. 

 Donaldson i lacks this " point," and its presence is not mentioned 




252 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



for speeiosa. It may perhaps be questioned whether all five of 

 these species are congeneric, but until a study is made of the male 

 genitalia of torrida and of speeiosa, it will be advisable to retain 

 them as they here stand. 

 Zygonyx ida Selys. 



The data for characters 1-7 are based on personal examination 

 of a male and a female from Java, by Herr Fruhstorfer, given 

 me at the Ko'nigliche Museum fur Naturkunde at Berlin, and a

CONCLUSIONS 



Owing to the small number of individuals of these species which 

 it was possible to examine, I have thought it undesirable to calcu- 

 late the percentages of variations, a- was done for Mar rot he mis. 



When the exclusively American DythemU, Paltothemis, Brech- 

 morhoga, Seapansa* and Macrothemis are compared with Schlzonyx, 



I was in error when I stated by implication (Proc. Bost. Soc. Xat. 

 Hist., xxviii, p. 303) that the nodal* sector of Scapanea is invariably not 

 waved. In some individuals it is waved, as Mr. McLachlan has pointed 

 out to me by letter, but I am not able to say which of these two conditions 

 is the predominant one, owing to inability to examine a long series of 

 specimens. 




1899 ] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 253 



Pseudomaeromia and Zygonyx, genera confined to the Old World, it 

 is evident that in spite of the resemblance in many peculiarities, no 

 complete parallelisms in structure exist. Thus Macrothemis, the most 

 specialized of the former group, agrees with Zygonyx ida in charac- 

 ters numbered 3, 6, 9, 12 and 13, but differs from Z. ida in Nos. 

 2, 10, 14 and 15; it agrees with Pseudomacromia speciosa (j>re- 

 tiosa $ ) in Nos. 2, 3, 6 and 1 4, but differs therefrom in Nos. 9, 

 10, 12 and 13; it agrees with Ps. hova in Nos. 3, 6, 10 and 14, 

 but differs therefrom in Nos. 2, 9 and 12. Similar results follow a 

 comparison of the other genera. 



Dr. Karsch 6 has pointed out a further analogy between Pseudo- 

 macromia and Macrothemis : the females have a strong tendency to 

 colored wings, the males to hyaline wings, although in the Libel- 

 lulinse, as in other insects, it is usually the reverse. 



As regards climatic distribution, both the American and the Old 

 World genera are inhabitants of the tropical and subtropical zones, 

 the northern and the southern boundaries of the latter being formed 

 by the annual isotherms of 20° C. The one exception to this state- 

 ment appears to be a male from Chile, referred to variety typographa 

 of Macrothemis ineguiunguis.' 1 



I believe that we do not yet know enough of the relationships 

 of the Libellulinse to enable one to form an opinion on this ques- 

 tion : Have the peculiar forms of the tarsal nails and of the femoral 

 armatures been independently acquired by these New World and 

 these Old World genera, or are they inheritances from a common 

 ancestor ? Of the physiological significance of these structures we 

 know absolutely nothing, and we await the observations of some 

 naturalist on the living insects to supply us with such information.

 specimeu figured, from Lower California, seems to fulfil the require- 

 ments of Carpenter's too brief description. 

 Eulima randolphi n. sp. PL XI, figs. 13, 14. 



Shell smooth, rather slender, shining, bluish white when empty, 

 but when the animal is dried in, the spire is orange colored above, 

 pink in the middle with sometimes a slight yellowish band on the 

 body whorl; opaque; outlines of the spire straight, conical. Apex 

 blunt, rounded, of moderate size, suture impressed; no varices. 

 Seven or eight whorls, the body whorl ovate, whorls of the spire 

 a little convex. Aperture ovate, outer lip sloping to the right, 

 nearly straight, in profile it is moderately arched forward below and 

 sometimes retracted very slightly above. Columella slender, con- 

 cave below, convex above, forming an angle with the convex 

 parietal wall, parietal callus very thin.

 Sciences, No. 73,729. 



This is the species mentioned by Mr. Randolph in the Nautilus 



for February, 1899, p. 112, as bein^ very plentiful under stones. 



It is a rather slender species distinguished from E. micans Cpr. by 



its smaller size, more impressed sutures, straighter profile of the 



outer lip and the blunter apex. It is distinguished from E. rutila 



by its blunter apex, fewer wdiorls, stouter form, iu being opaque 



and having the sutures more impressed. It also lacks any trace of

E. micans Cpr., Reeve, Concb. Icon., Vol. xv; Eulima, pi. iv, sp. 33 (Dec,

This is the largest California species of Eulima. It is gener- 

 ally of a bluish white color below and lead colored above. The 

 apex is often orange tinted, is quite sharp and seldom decollated. 



2 Carpenter has described ''Eulima {? var.) compacta from San Pedro as 

 similar to young E. micans but mucb less terete, margins of the spire little 

 excurved, apex lost, seven whorls remaining, base and aperture elongated, 

 the lip little sinuated. It measures .25 X -09 inch [= 6.25 X 2.25 mm.],

The sutures are liuear. Whorls about thirteen or fourteen. The 

 lip is concave above and convex below. There are several very 

 fine impressed lines indicating former lips, irregular in position 

 either on the right or left side or on both. Reeve's figure being 

 small and poor, I have given a camera drawing of a specimen from 

 San Pedro Bay, No. 72,674 of the Academy's collection. Car- 

 penter reports this species from Puget Sound, Vancouver, Cataline 

 Island, 30-40 fms. ; Sta. Barbara and San Diego. The specimen 

 figured measures alt. 11.4, diam. 3.2, length of aperture 3.2, 

 breadth 1.9 mm. 



Eulima rutila Cpr. PL XI, figs. 5, 6. 



Similar to E. micam, but smaller, more slender and with five 

 very fine varices, three on the right and two on the left side. The 

 specimen figured is from San Diego, No. 57,264 of the collection 

 of the Academy of Natural Sciences, and measures alt. 6.41, 

 diam. 1.83, length of aperture 1.91, breadth .83 mm. The 

 Academy has also one tray of this species from Scamnion's Lagoon, 

 Lower California. 



Carpenter thus describes Eulima (? var. ) rutila Cpr. : "Shell 

 similar to young E. mi cam, but more terete, highly polished, rosy 

 and livid tinted, nuclear whorls as iu E. micans; following whorls 

 10, elongate, very slender, base and aperture greatly prolonged; 

 columella more twisted; lip very sinuous, a callus running back-

A NEW AUSTRALIAN EULIMA. 

 BY HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



The group Lambert ia, reckoned by Tryon and Fischer a sub- 

 genus of Eulima, was instituted by Souverbie for a peculiar pupi- 

 form Eulimid with mucronate apex, from New Caledonia. Only 

 one species has been described, so far as I know; but in a sendiug 

 of shells from Port Stephens, N. S. W., from Dr. J. C. Cox, 

 another form referable to the same group occurred. As the name 

 Lambertia had already been used in zoology when Souverbie 

 wrote (by Robineau-Desvoidy in Diptera, 1863), I would propose 

 the name Hyper madus for the species described below, the new 

 group probably including Souverbie' s New Caledonian form also. 

 It is clearly distinct from Mucronalia. 

 Eulima (Hypermastus) Coxi n. sp. PI. XI, figs. 3, 4. 



Shell small, pupiform-cylindrical, glossy; translucent white, with 

 an opaque-white band midway between the sutures, spreadiug 

 downward; spire convexly tapering, slightly so for the greater 

 part of its length, but more suddenly above, leaving the initial 

 whorl projecting like a mucro or teat, which is tilted or oblique. 

 Whorls five (exclusive of the apical mucro), not in the least 

 impressed at the sutures, the suture slightly ascending and then 

 deflexed at the aperture; base tapering. Aperture semioval, 

 acuminate above; peristome bending foi-ward a little below, some- 

 what inflexed above; columella concave, passing without angle into 

 the parietal margin, which bears a thin callus. 



Length 4, greatest diameter 1.43, length of aperture 1.4 mm.; 

 diameter of apical " button " .15 mm. 



Port Stephens, New South Wales, Australia, collected by Dr. J. 

 C. Cox. Type is No. 71,306 coll. A. N. S. P. 



The general contour differs considerably from that of Lambertia 

 }[nntrouzieri Souv., which is moreover a far larger species. The 

 surface is unbroken by varices, and the white line running midway 

 of the whorls looks deceptively like the suture. Mr. Charles 

 Hedley, the malacologist of the Australian Museum, tells me that 

 he knows of no description of an Australian Eulima resembling 

 this one. 



I am indebted to Mr. Yanatta for camera lucida drawings, which 

 show the form of the shell better than any description.

SOME NOTES ON COCCIDJE. 

 BY T. D. A. COCKERELL. 



The following paper is the result of some work done in the 

 Division of Entomology, Department of Agriculture, while on a 

 brief visit in the spring of 1899 I am greatly indebted to Dr. 

 Howard and his staff for the facilities and assistance kindly given 

 me. 



LLAVEIA Sign. 

 Ann. Soc. Ent. France, 1875, p. 370. 

 Ortonia Sign., Ann. Soc. Ent. France, 1875, p. 367 (not Ortonia Wood, 

 1869 ; nor Ortonia Nich., 1873). 

 Protortonia Twns., Jn. N. Y. Ent. Soc, 1898, p. 169. 



These are all one genus, the species of which, when adult, have 

 normally 11 -jointed antenna?. I believe it will yet be necessary to 

 sink Llaveia as a synonym of Monophlebus; especially since Her- 

 rera (La Naturaleza, 1884) says the c? of Llaveia axin lias eight 

 ' ' cerdas terminales ' ' on the abdomen, which I suppose to be the 

 filiform processes of the c? Monophlebus. 



Mounts made by Mr Pergande from topotypes of Ortonia 

 inexicanorum and primitiva show 11-segmented antenna?. The 

 locality of mexicanorum is Mixcoac, not " Misebac. " Duges 

 described the antenna? of the 9 Llaveia axin as 10- segmented, but 

 Herrera declares there are 11 segments. I have only seen the third 

 stage (9-segmented) and larva. The following table will separate 

 the adults of Llaveia : 



Size very large; length 15 mm. or over 1 



Smaller, length of adult 9 cleared and mounted 7 mm ... 3 



1. Pubescence scanty; length 15-18 mm.; antenna? short, seg- 



ments broader than long, except the last, 



Llaveia bouvari (Sign ). 

 Pubescence abundant; length 23-25 mm 2 



2. Legs and antenna? reddish; Mexico. . Llaveia axin (Llave). 



Ecuador ; separated by no tangible characters from the last, 

 so far as known ; perhaps identical with it. 



Llaveia uhleri (Sign.). 




260 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



3. Skin very thickly covered with short hairs; antennae long, none 

 of the segments, unless the first, 'twice as broad as long, those 

 after the sixth conspicuously longer than broad; eleventh 

 narrow, cylindrical. 192 fi long. Llaveia primitive/, (Twns. ). 

 Skin with very many round glands, but hairs very minute, 

 sparse, scarcely noticeable ; antennae shorter, the first 8 seg- 

 ments twice as broad as long; 9 and 10 considerably broader 

 than long; 11 oval, . . . Llaveia mexieanorum (Ckll.). 



The antennae and legs of primitiva and mexieanorum are very 

 dark sepia brown, even in the immature stage ; this is very differ- 

 ent from the clear ferruginous of axin. The antennae of the third 

 stage of axin are of the type of mexieanorum, but the skin is very 

 hairy as in primitiva. 



Margarodes polonicus (Linn.). 



Porphyrophora polonica Auct. 



The genus Porphyrophora Brandt is essentially the same as 

 Margarodes, the latter name having priority. There is a good 

 figure of both the $ and the " pearl " of 31. polonicus in Van F. 

 Houttuyn's Natuurlyke Historie, 176(3, Vol. 10, pi. lxxxiii. 



COCCUS Linne. 

 Syst. Nat., Ed. x, 1758, p. 455. 



The first species mentioned is hesperidum (Leeanium). The last 

 is cacti. The other species belong to Chrysomphalus, Kermes, 

 Pulvinnria, Mytilaspis, Chionaspis, Eulecanium, Ceroplastes, Por- 

 phyrophora and some Dactylopiine genus. The Coccus cacti of 

 Syst. Nat., ed. x, is a Monophlelid, so the Coccus of Signoret is not 

 the Linnean genus in any sense. The first to divide Coccus L. 

 was Geofiroy, who used Chermes for the Lecaniinae and Diaspiuae 

 (this is not the true Chermes Linn, , which is Psylla), and restricted 

 Coccus to ihe Coccinaz. Under Coccus he described three species, 

 C. adonidum, etc., which is a Dactylopius, C. phalaridis which is 

 some Dactylopiid, and C. ulmi, etc., which is Gossyparia. Only 

 one of these is in the Syst. Nat, ed. x, and that is phalaridis, 

 which thus becomes the type of the genus. For a description of 

 C. phalaridis we may refer to the Fauna Suecica, ed. 1761, p. 266. 

 It is said to live at the roots of Phalaris eanariensis, and to be 

 attended by Formica rubra. The description runs: " Animal 

 magnitudine seminis cannabis, exalbidum, solis pedibus parurn 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 261 



incarnatis. Antenna? vix corporis } partem adtingunt. Rostrum 

 inflexum. Anus retusa, vix villosa." This should be easily iden- 

 tified when collected again in Sweden; most likely it is a Eipersia. 

 The insect seen by Geoffrey was possibly not the same, a> he says 

 it is " un peu couleur de chair." Lichtenstein suggested that 

 phalaridis might well be the Coccus radicum-graminis Fonsc, for 

 which he proposed the generic name Fonscolombia. 



Coccus Signoret will stand as Pseudococcus Westwood (not Pseu- 

 dococcus Sign., which is Phenacoccu.s Ckl].). 



Coccus adonidum Gmelin. 



There is no such thing as Dadylopius adonidum Linne. In the 

 early editions of the Fauna Suedca Linne had a Pediculus adoni- 

 dum, but finding out that it was not a Pediculus, and apparently 

 not knowing what to do with it, he omitted it altogether from the 

 Syst. Nat., ed. x, from which our nomenclature starts. I also fail 

 to find any trace of it in the twelfth edition, but in Gtnelin's 

 edition Coccus adonidum appears with a description. The descrip- 

 tion, however, refers to a longitudinal dorsal elevated line, and 

 other characters which belong evidently to some Orthezia .' 



Geoffroy's " Coccus adonidum corpore roseo, farinaceo, atis 

 setisque niveis," is, on the other hand, evidently a Dadylopius, but 

 his name is not a binomial. 



Dadylopius adonidum must therefore disappear from our lists. 



Coccus cacti Linn6. 



Syst. Nat., Ed. x, 1758. 



Some of the works cited by Linne' (e. g., Reaumur) relate to 

 the true cochineal insect ; but the whole of the Linnean description 

 pertains to a Monophlcebld! The specimens described were col- 

 lected in the island of St. Eustache by Daniel Rolander, and sent 

 alive to Upsala in 175(3. At the same time Rolander sent a num- 

 ber in alcohol to DeGeer, who (Mem., Vol. vi, p. 44^ ) gave a full 

 account of them, with a figure. The alcoholic specimens were 

 yellow ochre or pale rose; Linne', having seen them alive, says the 

 abdomen is purplish. The antennas and legs are black; antennae 

 11-segmented; mouth parts present. The shape is long oval, like 

 Llaveia or Ortonia. Linne' says nothing about any ovisac, or 

 cottony covering, so it was doubtless absent. 



This species seems not to be identical with anything known to 




262 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



modern coccidologists, but it is probably a Llaveia or closely related 

 form. It will doubtless be rediscovered when looked for in the 

 type locality. 



The cochineal insect can stand as Pseudococcus cacti (Burm., 

 Handb. der Entom., 1839, Vol. 2, p. 72). Burmeister's cita- 

 tions of literature belong to the cochineal, and he ignores the Syst. 

 Nat, ed. x. His description of the J 1 agrees with the cochineal, 

 but his 9 , with caudal setae, is doubtful. The locality is given as 

 Mexico, and it is definitely stated that it is the animal which pro- 

 duces the scarlet pigment. 



SPHJEROCOCCOPSIS ri. g. 



Type S. inflatipes ( Splicer ococcus inflatipes Maskell, Trans. N. Z. Inst., 

 xxv, p. 238). 



This is widely separated from Sjjhcerococcus by the presence of 



well-developed legs in the adult 9 : the first four small, the hind 



pair very large. The margin is beset with spines. 



PHCENICOCOCCUS n. g. 

 T} r pe P. marlatti n. sp. 



Adult $. Skin tuberculate, but without conspicuous glands; 

 spiracles small; antenna? reduced to a mere tubercle; otherwise like 

 Sphcer ococcus. The anal ring is hairless in larva and adult. 



Larva with four long caudal bristles instead of only two. No 

 lateral or dorsal spirjes. 

 Phoenicococcus marlatti n sp. 



Adult ¥ ; broad oval or plum -shaped, wine-red when alive, (fide 

 Marlatt), 1 to 1^ mm. long; occurring packed in great numbers 

 in little cavities about 10 or 12 mm. long by 4 or 5 broad on the 

 midribs of the leaves, communicating with the air by a narrow 

 longitudinal slit. 



Skin transparent after boiling, with only a faint brown tinge, its 

 surface beset with numerous hyaline tubercles, which make it seem 

 tessellate, but no spines or hairs, and only a very few scattered 

 glands, except laterad of the spiracles, where there are numerous 

 small round glands grouped more or less in a semicircle. Spiracles 

 formed as in Sphcer ococcnts, but small. Antennre mere minute dark 

 protuberances. Mouth parts well developed. Rostral loop bent 

 suddenly near the base. 



Larva elongate, more than twice as long as broad, Avithout lateral 

 or dorsal spines; antennae 6-segmented, formula 612 (35) 4; 6 long, 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 263 



cylindrical ; 1 very large. Segment 6 has two very long hairs at 

 the end. Interval between the antenna? less than the greatest 

 diameter of the first segment. Caudal tubercles little produced; 

 each with two bristles. Femora much swollen, legs otherwise 

 ordinary. 



Hub. — On date palms (Phoenix) imported from Algeria; found 

 by Mr. C. L. Marlatt, who made some study of it years ago. Mr. 

 Marlatt informs me that on the living plants the slight swellings 

 containing the insects are extremely inconspicuous, and very likely 

 to be overlooked even on close examination. 



Since the above description was written, P. marlatti has been 

 found by the writer in great numbers on the insides of the sheath- 

 ing bases of the leaves of a date palm just imported from Algeria. 

 Here it is not beneath the epidermis. 



Dactylopiine Genera. 

 After a consideration of the larval characters, I am willing to 

 recognize five genera of Dactylopiini with the legs and antennae 

 rudimentary or absent. It is interesting that the larva? of these 

 forms, which are so degenerate in the adult stage, differ more than 

 do the larva? of ordinary coccids ; and, moreover, their differences 

 are just such as separate the adults of the genera which retain 

 their legs aud antenna? to the last. 



The following table will separate the genera mentioned : 

 Newly hatched larva elongate, after the manner of Rhizcecus and 



Pergandiella, antenna? 6-segmented, 1 



Newly hatched larva oval or elliptical, 2 



1. Terminal antennal segment of larva oval, little longer than the 



one before Pseudolecanium Ckll. 



Terminal antennal segment of larva very large, as long as the 



three before Chjetococcus Maskell. 



% Larva with 5-segmented antenna?; anal ring of adult with 4 



hairs Cryptococcus Dougl. 



Larva with (3-segmented antenna?; anal ring of adult with 6 



hairs Antonina Sign. 



Larva with 7 -segmented antenna?; anal ring of adult and larva 



with 17 hairs Kermicus Newst. 



Sphcerococcu-s tokionis Ckll., Bull. 4, Tech. Ser., Div. Ent., will

Fonscolombia radicum-graminis (Fonsc). 



Fonscolombia graminis Licht., Ent. Mo. Mag., 1877, July, pp. 31, 35. 

 This insect, described by Fonscoloinbe in 1834, is found in 

 France at the roots of cereals. The 9 has 6- jointed antennse, 

 and the $ is apterous. Lichtenstein suggests that this may be the 

 Coccus phalaridis, but this is at present doubtful. Should it be 

 phalaridis, it will belong to Coccus L. ; but otherwise Lichtenstein' s 

 genus Fonscolombia is valid, and has priority over Pseudochermes 

 and Apterococcus, proposed for a congeneric species. 



Fonscolombia fraxini (Kalt.) 



Ripersia (Apterococcus) fraxini (Newst. ). 



This insect was first described by Kaltenbach in 1874. In 

 1895 Nitsche proposed for it the subgeneric name Pseudochermes. 

 Newstead, when describing the insect as new, used the same specific 

 name as that of Kaltenbach. 

 Phenacoccus mespili. 



Signoret in 1875 described this insect for the first time, but 

 called it Pseudococcus mespili Geoff roy. The Chermes mespili *erico 

 albo of Geoffroy, as well as the Coccus mespili Gmelin (Syst. Nat., 

 1788), based upon it, are manifestly referable to Pulvinaria. 

 Geoffroy says his insect appears not to differ from his Chermes 

 carpini serico albo, which is also a Pulvinaria. Signoret also cites 

 Fonscolombe's supposed Coccus eratozgi, described iu 1834, but 

 that is also a Pulvinaria. Signoret has suggested that the Coccus 

 pruni Burin., 1849, may be Pseudococcus mespili. The description 

 of Burmeister is cpiite inadequate to demonstrate this, and differs 

 in the statement that the insect is greenish gray, P. mespil 

 Sign, being reddish. The Phenacoccus is therefore nameless, but 

 it is here proposed to use for it the name mespili, which will not 

 conflict with Geoffroy' s name, the latter pertaining to a different 

 genus. 



Phenacoccus (?) farinosus (Gmel.). 



Coccus farinosus alni, DeGeer, Mem , Vol. vi, 1776, p. 412, pi. 28, figs. 

 17-20. 



Coccus farinosus, Gmelin, Syst. Nat., Ed. xiii, 1788, p. 2220. 



This is a Dactylopiine found on the alder ; clear, rather reddish, 

 brown, mealy-farinose, eventually covering itself, except the head, 

 with a cottony sac, in the hind part of which the eggs are laid. 

 In the subadult stage it has short lateral tassels, but no long caudal

ones. This should be easily recognized when found again in 



Europe. 



Ehizaecus (?) terrestris (Newst.). 



Bipersia terrestris Newst., Ent. Mo. Mag., 1895, p. 213. 



This has in common with Rhizcscus fdlcifer the peculiar elongate 

 shape, the 5-segmented antennae, the elongated mentum, and the 

 prominent caudal tubercles. Newstead figures no eyes, nor men- 

 tions them. The terminal segment of the antenna has not the curi- 

 ous falciform spines observed in R. falcifer and eloti. 

 Rhizsecus (?) mammillariae (Targ.-Tozz.). 



Dactylopius mammillaricB (Targ.-Tozz.). 



Westwoodia sp. n. (?), Targ.-Tozz., Aunali di Agricoltura. l iS 4, pp. 402, 

 403, figs. 



Found at the roots of Mammilla ria. Targioni-Tozzetti at first 

 called it Dactylopius mammilla ria-, but later left it without a 

 specific name. He says his material was immature, but the tibia is 

 considerably larger than the tarsus, pointing to a subadult condi- 

 tion at least. The insect differs from Pergandiella in any stage by 

 the elongate mentum; in this it agrees with Rhizeecus, but it differs 

 from that in having well-developed eyes, and in lacking the falci- 

 form spines on the antenna?. The antenna?, though 6-segmented, 

 resemble more those of R. (?) terrextris than typical Rhiza-cus or 

 Pergandiella. Apparently this insect will form a new genus. 

 Oudablis parietariae (Licht.). 



Boisdutnlia pa rietaria Licht., Ball. Soc. Ent. France, 1881, p. cxv. 



This species has been overlooked by later writers. The z is 

 clear red; the ? mealy white. It is found on Parietaria diffusa. 



Sugarcane Mealy-bugs. — In the collection of the Division of 

 Entomology at Washington I find mounted specimens of Daety- 

 lopius calceolaria and D. sacchari from new localities, identified by 

 Mr. T. Pergande. While recording these, I take the opportunity 

 of giving detailed measurements, not hitherto published for these 

 species. It will be seen that although superficially similar and 

 having similar habits, the insects are very distinct in structure.

 Westwoodia Sign., Signoretia Kraatz, and Bergrothia Kraatz; but 

 all these names are preoccupied. I formerly misunderstood its 

 generic characters, and was later led thereby to place it as a syn- 

 onym of Dactylopius. It is appropriately dedicated to Mr. Theo.

Ha b.— Washington, D. C, on ash, November 4, 1898 (Per- 

 gande, Div. Ent., !No. 8,200). Differs from P. perrisii princi- 

 pally by its smaller size, scarcely pubescent legs, and in being 

 arboreal, whereas j*> rrisii was found on grasses. Its color is also 

 different. This interesting insect ought to have been published 

 under Mr. Pergande's name, as he had carefully examined it and 

 noted its peculiarities before I saw it. It is only after urging him 

 to publish it, without result, that I now, with his consent, make it 

 known. I am permitted to supplement my description by the 

 following extract from Mr. Pergande's notes : 



" Found in cracks of bark on the trunk of an ash on the Agricul- 

 tural Department grounds three specimens of a species of West- 

 woodia, one of them still crawling about. The others were infested 

 by a hymen opterous parasite, though both were still living. The 

 active ? was very slender, about 4 mm. long, by 1 mm. in diame- 

 ter, and of a brownish-red color but covered with a mealy excre- 

 tion which gave it a grayish or moldy appearance. The other two 

 were in addition to the mealy substance covered by a woolly excre- 

 tion, which was rather sparse anteriorly, but became very dense 



toward and around the end of the body There was also 



found in one of the cracks a mass of white and woolly excretion 

 containing e$i'j;> and young larva? of this species, all of which were 



of a pale purplish color With the eggs were also found 



one minute specimen of a bright red species of Sciru-s, and one

minute species of Gamasidse, of a faintly yellowish color. They 

 were feeding on the eggs " (Pergande MS.). 



Gossyparia spuria (Modeer). 



Coccus vl/ni. Olivier. Encycl. Meth., Vol. vi, 1791, p. 97. 

 This species was well figured by Reaumur, and is the Coccus 

 id ml, corpore fusco, serico albo, of Geoffroy. Geoflroy'sname is not 

 a binomial, so the proper name of the insect is that given by 

 Modeer, which was in general use before Signoret's time. 



The Coccus ahti Modeer, 1778, is a Lecanium, and has nothing 

 to do with Gossyparia ; see Douglas, Ent. Mo. Mag., September, 

 1886, pp. 80, 81. 

 Eriococcus palmeri n. sp. 



9. — Sac 1^—2 mm. long, of the usual oval shape, of closely 

 woven pure white cottony secretion, with many loose threads on 

 the surfaces producing a kind of pubescence. Caudal aperture 

 quite large. 



9. — Boiled in KHO, does not stain the liquid. Antenna? uni- 

 formly 6 -segmented, with 3 longer than the subsequent segments 

 together. 2, 1 and 6 subequal in length; 4 and 5 subequal and 

 shortest. Antenna? and legs pale brown. Dermal spines crowded 

 and very large. Femur rather stout; tibia and tarsus long and 

 slender, tarsus somewhat longer than tibia, with two long bristles 

 on its inner side. Claw long, curved. All the digitules filiform, 

 those of the claw extremely slender, those of the tarsus extending 

 a little beyond end of claw. Claw with a minute denticle on the 

 inner side jusl before the tip. Caudal tubercles long, cylindrical. 



The following mea.-urements are in fi:

The 9 described by Bouche is evidently our A. oncidii ; it is 

 said to be probably from the West Indies. Bouche' s cT is perhaps 

 some other species. 



Asterolecanium rhamni Kieffer.

Found on Rhamnus in Algeria, forming galls. This supposed

 the description and figures, immediately recognized it as a Trioza.

Bouche described his quercicola as elevated, rough and dark

 olecanium. The name proposed by Ratzeburg is very appropriate. 



KERMES Boitard. 

 Manuel d' Entom ologie, Vol. ii, 1828, pp. 171. 172. 



The name Kermes had been used in a popular sense from early 



times, but Boitard is the first author I find using it as a genus in 



scientific nomenclatu re. He includes in it Kermes variegalus, K. 




270 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



ilicis and K. reniformis, as well as species of Lecanium, etc. Mr. 

 T. Pergande suggests that Kermes is in reality allied to Eriococcus. 

 This had not occurred to me, but after going over the characters 

 with this thought in mind, I am inclined to agree with him. 

 Kermes ilicis (L.). 



Coccus ilicis L., Syst. Nat., Ed. x, 1758, p. 455. 



Linne gives no description, but cites Reaumur. The insect 

 described and figured by Reaumur is the globular black species, 

 later named K. bauhinii, not the K. vermilio. The latter there- 

 fore remains valid. 

 Kermes quercus (L.). 



Coccus quercus L., Syst. Nat., Ed. x, 1758, p. 455. 



Linne gives no description, but cites, " Reaum. ins. 4, t. 6, f. 

 1-4, and alia f. 8, 9, 10. 



Reaumur's figures 1-4 represent Kermes reniformis of Siguoret 

 and authors, which must therefore fall as a synonym of K 

 quercus. The figures 8, 9, 10, are of a large Pulvinaria, also 

 found on oak. 



Kermes quercus Newst. MS. will need a different name. The 

 Lecanium quercus " L. " of Signoret is not the Linnean insect. 



Pseudokermes armatus (Ckll.). 

 Lecanium armatum Ckll., Am. Mag. N. Hist., June, 1898, p. 436. 

 Mr. Pergande made a mount of the second stage from out of the 

 original lot. It is 1 mm. long approximately, and has the legs and 

 antenna? mere stout, conical protuberances, extremely small ; skin 

 with numerous figure-of-8 glands; anal plates large, mouth parts 

 well-developed. 



Lecanium coffeae Walker. 



List Homop. Ins. B. M., 1852, p. 1079. 



This is said to have transverse ridges, which suggests oleee ; but 

 it is flat and only 2 mm. long, so it must be in the second stage 

 only, and therefore may be hemisphcericum. Tradition in Ceylon 

 identifies it with hemispha rieum, and I have used the name coffece 

 for that insect accordingly. Mr. Pergande, however, tells me he 

 saw specimens in the Berlin Museum labelled coffece, and believed 

 to be authentic, and they were olece. On the whole, the name 

 coffece had better be dropped. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 2(1 



Lecanium ulmi (Gmelin). 



Coccus tdmi Gmel., Syst. Nat., p. 2217 (not Coccus ulmi I,.). 



This is the Lecanium fasciatum Costa, with transverse brown 

 bands in the manner of L. perornatum. It is DeGeer's Coccus 

 ovatus alius fusco transverse striatus, ulmi, figured on pi. 28, f. 7. 

 It is also the Chermes ulmi rotundus of Geoffroy, and Olivier's 

 Chermes ulmi. Olivier says he found it in Holland in May, 1735. 



Douglas (Ent. Mo. Mag., September, 1886, p. 79) remarks that 

 in England are found only wholly brown scales of L. ulmi, such 

 as were also known to Signoret in France. He queries whether 

 the bands may not be peculiar to the immature stage, but it seems 

 probable that they are retained to the last, as in L. perornatum. 

 In that case the English L. ulmi will require a new name, being 

 apparently a distinct species; unless, as Douglas suggests, it may 

 be identical with L. alni (Modeer). 



Lecanium liriodendri (Gmel.). 



Coccus liriodendri Gmelin, Syst. Nat., 1788, p. 2220. 



It has long been supposed that this might be identical with our 

 L. tulipiferoE Cook, but nobody appears to have been able to con- 

 sult the description (Hamburgisehes Magazine, xii, 1753, pp. 

 3-24) quoted by Gmelin, on which the specific name is based. 

 Fortunately I have been able to obtain the work at the Library oi 

 Congress; it proves to be an article by Dr. John Hill, of London, 

 relating to a Lecanium he found on the tulip tree in a plantation 

 of American trees at Goodwood; and afterwards, on the same 

 kind of tree, in Burlington Gardens, Chiswick, England. Not 

 being able to make very much out of the article myself, I asked 

 Mr. Pergande to read it, which he did, also without any definite 

 result. It is plain that the insect was a Lecanium, and it is per- 

 haps probable that it was L. tulipiferas, but the description is so 

 vague, besides containing some apparently inaccurate statements, 

 that there can be no certainty. It is, however, very desirable that 

 some one should ascertain whether any tulip trees (Liriodendron 

 are still living at the places named, and, if so, whether they are 

 infested by this Lecanium.

 well-marked round glauds, 14 ,« diam., consisting of a small ring

1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



Legs of the same Specimens. 



273 



P. cupanim, aurantii and psidii are superficially similar, and are 

 liable to be confused. In cupanice and pjsidii the marginal spines 

 are about 21 fi long, and more or less fimbriate at the ends; in 

 aurantii they are simple, ouly those next to the spiracular incisions 

 being slightlv flattened and incliued to be fimbriate at the ends. 

 On the other hand, by the antenna? aurantii and cupanice are close 

 together, and psidii differs greatly by the long 3, as also in the very 

 long tibia. 



The marginal spiues of flavicam are sharp aud quite simple ; 

 those of ribesicB are also quite simple, very slender, the longer ones 

 43 p.. 



The marginal spines of the " camellicola" are simple, very 

 slender, 39-60 ft apart, and 34-47 ft long. 



The bigelovice has the antenna? practically as in " camellicola," 

 but the legs will distinguish it. 



The species marked " camellicola," may possibly be the insect 

 intended by Signoret, but his description does not agree. I have 

 considered it rather a form of my P. simulans; vide Canad. 

 Entom., 1895, p. 258. 



Aulacaspis coccois (Licht.). 



Diaspis coccois Licht., Bull. Soc. Ent. France, 1882, p. xxxvi. 



This is presumably the insect afterwards described by Morgan as 

 D. tentaculatus. The exuviae are distinct and almost central. 



Chrysomphalus aonidum (Linn.). 



Coccus aonidum L., Syst. Nat , Ed. x, p. 455. 



The description reads: " Habitat in Asia? arboribus semper- 

 virentibus ut in Camellia, aliisque. Prsecedenti [hesperidum] minor,

sed similis. Testa orbiculata, planiuscula, atro-purpurascens, 

 centro f. vertice tuberculo rotundo rubro quod in senescentibus 

 aperitur." This seems to me to apply excellently to one thing, 

 and one only, viz., Ghrysomphalus ficus Ashm. Signoret naturally 

 could not recognize the species, because he did not have it. It 

 seems probable that the insect is after all a native of Asia, with 

 C. dictyospermi ; while the group of G. persece, etc., is truly 

 neotropical. 

 Chrysomphalus rossi Maskell. 



Manila, Philippine Is., on an orchid, quarantined by Mr. A. 

 Craw at San Francisco. The material was very scanty, but was 

 examined by Mr. Marlatt and the writer, and identified as rossi. 

 This is the first coccid record from the Philippines. 



Aspidiotus acuminatus Targ.-Tozz. 



This species was omitted from my Check List. It is a species of 

 Semibeilesia, and, so far as I can see, identical with A. rapax 

 Com st. 

 Aspidiotus euonymi Targ.-Tozz. 



This is also an Hemiberlesia, and has been referred to A. rapax. 

 It is, however, one of the A. cydonlce group, having four groups 

 of circumgenital glands. 

 Aspidiotus saccharicaulis Zehntner. 



This is an Odonagpis, and hardly more than a variety of A. 

 secretins. The following table will separate the three races of 

 secretus : 



(1) Two groups of circumgenital glands, not connected above by 

 a line of glands. . . A. secretus var. from Ceylon (Green). 



(2) Groups of circumgenital glands connected above by a line of 



glands A. secretus Ckll., type from Japan. 



(3) Groups of circumgenital glands connected above by a median 



group which is three deep in the middle. 



A. secretus race mccharicaulis (Zehnt. ). 



A new locality for A. secretus is Honolulu, Hawaii, on bamboo, 

 1899 (Geo. Camp , in coll. Div. Ent. Dept. Agric). 

 Mytilaspis abietis Sign. 



Signoret, in Bull. Soc. Ent. France, 1882, p. clxxxiv, admits 

 that his "Mytilaspis abietis Schr." is not Schrank's insect, the 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 275 



Jatter being an Aspidiotus. He then proposes that the name abietis 

 be retained for the Mytilaspis with himself as its author. This 

 must hold, and the name confusus, proposed by Horvath, will fall 

 as a synonym. 



Mytilaspis ulmi (L.). 



Coccus ulmi Linne, Syst. Nat., Ed. x, 1758, p. 455. 

 Mytilaspis pomorum Bouche et Auctt. 



Linne gives no description, but cites, " Re'aum. ins. 4, t. 2, 

 5. f. 5-7, and alia t. 7. f. 1-10." Reaumur's pi. 5, figs. 5-7, 

 represent the Mytilaspis of the elm, which is now considered iden- 

 tical with that of the apple; they are, in fact, the very figures 

 which Geoffroy cites for his Coccus arborum linearis. Reaumur's 

 pi. 7, figs. 1-10 represent Gossyparia spuria (ulmi). 



Mytilaspis beckii (E.Newman). 



Coccus beckii E. Newman, Entomologist, Feb., 1869, pp. 217, 218. 

 Mytilaspis citricola (Pack.), Conist. et Auctt. 



The name beckii is based on Beck's figures and notes, which 

 are unmistakable. Newman erroneously supposed the apple 

 Mytilaspis to be the same. 



Parlatoria proteus var. crotonis Dougl. 



Ent. Mo. Mag., April, 1887, p. 242. 



The species found so commonly on crotons, described as crotonis 

 (penjandei var. ) by the present writer, appears to be the same as 

 that of Douglas. I had overlooked the latter' s article on the sub- 

 ject. 



Diaspis pentagona Targ.-Tozz. 



Ri vista di Bachicoltura, 1886, No. 11 ; reprinted in Bull. Soc. Ent. Ital., 

 1887, pp. 184-186. 



n. syn. Diaspis amygdali Tryon. 



The probability of this synonymy had occurred independently to 

 Mr. Marlatt and the present writer ; an examination of Italian 

 material of pentagona confirms it. 



Targioni-Tozzetti's 1886 account is of a very general nature, 

 but will hold the name. In a pamphlet published in Milan in 

 1890 he gave a scientific description with figures. There is also a 

 description in BuU. Soc. Eat. Ital., xxi, 1890.

 mens of small gray foxes from Central America, south of the 

 Isthmus of Tehuantepec. These represent two hitherto undescribed 

 species, one from the arid tropical coast of Yucatan, the other 

 from the humid tropical region of Guatemala and Chiapas. To 

 the kindness of Mr. D. G. Elliot I owe the opportunity to com- 

 pare these animals with the type of Urocyon fraterculus, the prop- 

 erty of the Field Columbian Museum. Dr. C Hart Merriam has 

 placed at my disposal the Mexican and Guatemalan gray foxes in 

 the Biological Survey collection I publish this paper here by 

 permission of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. 

 Urocyon. parvidens sp. now 



Type c r (ekin and skull), No. ij;f§§, United States National 

 Museum, collected at Merida, Yucatan, by A. Schott. Original 

 number 385. 



General character*. — Most like Urocyon fraterculus (Elliot), 1 

 from San Felipe, Yucatan, but teeth smaller, tail shorter, and 

 color more fulvous. 



Color. — Fur of body composed of two kinds of hair, one short, 

 dense, and woolly, the other long, stiff and sparse. Except in the 

 whitish areas where they are pale to base, the hairs of the under 

 fur are cinereous through lower third, then creambuff or pinkish 

 buff to tip. The long hairs are whitish at base (conspicuously 

 paler than the bases of the under fur) gradually shading to dark 

 brown near middle ; the tip black. Between the black tip and the 

 brown median area is a conspicuous white ring, the base of which 

 is level with the tips of the under fur. The varying combinations 

 of the buff of the under fur and the white rings and black tips of 

 the longer hairs give the dorsal surface its color. On the head the 

 under fur, here darkened to tawny ochraceous, and the white rings

are most conspicuous. From ears to base of tail the black and 

 white predominate, producing a clear gray, blackening irregularly 

 along median line and very faintly tinged with buff. On the sides 

 the buff becomes more conspicuous and slightly darker, and on the 

 sides of the belly both white and black practically disappear. 

 Chin, upper side of muzzle and posterior half of upper lip dusky. 

 Cheeks, sides of muzzle, throat and median line to base of tail 

 buffy white. Inner sides of thighs and area between them white. 

 Bases of ears, area behind ears, on sides of neck and across chest 

 ochraceous buffi Distal half of ears duller than base. Inner sur- 

 face buffy white. Outer sides of front legs and posterior surface of 

 hind legs ochraceous buff'. Anterior surface of hind leg and dorsal 

 surface of pes buffy white. Soles and palms ochraceous buff. 

 Tail gray with a black dorsal stripe and tip and ill-defined ventral 

 buffy area. 



Skull. — The skull is exactly similar to that of Urocyon frater- 

 (■II lux. It therefore needs no comparison with that of any of the 

 members of the dnereoargenteus group. 



Measurements of skull of type: 2 greatest length, 102; basal 

 length, 94.4; basilar length, 92; palatal length (median), 47; 

 nasals (median), 30; zygomatic breadth, 53; interorbital breadth, 

 20.4; breadth across postorbital processes, • 30. 4 ; greatest breadth 

 of brain case, 40.6; mastoid breadth, 36.4; greatest depth of 

 brain case, 33.6; space between audital bullae, 5.6; upper tooth- 

 row (exclusive of incisors), 41; mandible, 74; mandibular tooth- 

 row (exclusive of incisors), 46. 



Teeth. — The teeth of Urocyon parvidens are uniformly much 

 smaller than in U. fraterculus, but the differences are most con- 

 spicuous in the first molar and the second, third and fourth pre- 

 molars. The greatest diameter of the crown of the first molar in 

 three specimens of U. parvidens is respectively, 8.8, 8.8 and 8.6. 

 In the type of U. fraterculus it is 10.6. The greatest, diameter of 

 the crown of the carnassial in three skulls of U. parvidens is 9.2,

9.4 and 9.2. In the type of U. fraterculus it is 11. The second 

 and third premolars in U. fraterculus are long and crowded, while 

 in U. parvidens they are narrow and widely spaced. The height 

 is about the same in each. The length of each of these teeth 

 including cingulum equals or exceeds the height in U. fraterculus, 

 but is much less than the height in U. parvidens. In this respect 

 U. jxtrvidens resembles the members of the cinereoargenteus group. 

 In the mandibular teeth the differences are of the same kind, but 

 somewhat less defined. Length of first lower molar 9.2 in U. par- 

 videns, 10. 6 in U. fraterculus. 



Measurements. — Type: 3 Total length, 720; tail vertebra?, 240; 

 hind foot, 95; ear from meatus, 51; ear from crown, 46. Aver- 

 age of four specimens including the type: Total length, 722; tail 

 vertebra?, 222; hind foot, 93; ear from meatus, 50; ear from 

 crown, 46 (all from dry specimens). 



Specimens examined. — Four, all from the type locality. 



General remarks. — Urocy on fraterculus and U. jjarvidens form a 

 group readily distinguishable from the relatives of U. cinereoar- 

 genteus by their slender feet and relatively larger and more inflated 

 audital bulla?. The bulla? in these small skulls are much larger 

 than in members of the cinereoargenteus group of approximately 

 the same size, and fully 'equal to those of the largest forms. They 

 are more abruptly elevated above level of basioccipital (when skvdl 

 is held upside down) and the outer anterior face slopes away much 

 more abruptly. They are placed more closely together than in the 

 members of the cinereoargenteus group. In a specimen of U. 

 littoralis, only 193 in greatest length, the space between the bulla? 

 is 8.4, and in the other forms this relative spacing is maintained.

 National Museum (Biological Survey Collection), collected at 

 Nenton, Guatemala, December 16, 1895, by E. W. Nelson and 

 E. A. Goldman. Original number 8, 801 . 



General characters. — Most like Urocyon littoralis Baird from the 

 Santa Barbara Islands, California, but color darker and richer. 

 Carnassial tooth more robust than in U. littoralis. Audital bulla?

slightly more inflated than in the other members of the cinereo- 

 argerdeus group. 



Color. — Type specimen in unworn winter coat. Quality of fur 

 and arrangement of color bands as in U. parvidens and the other 

 members of the genus. Dorsal surface clear gray formed by the 

 nearly ecptal mixture of the black tips and white sublerminal rings 

 of the coarse hair-. Under fur pale creambuff, appearing at 

 surface only Avhen hair is disarranged. Top of head tinged with 

 tawny. On the sides the black tips are less conspicuous than on 

 the back, and the buff of the under fur appears distinctly at the 

 surface. Belly ochraceous buff except along median line and 

 between hind legs, where it is dull white. Base of ear and area 

 behind ear tawny ochraceous; this area extending back to front 

 leg, but much suffused with gray except on and close to ear. 

 Distal half of ear thickly sprinkled with dusky hairs which consid- 

 erably dull the ochraceous. Inner surface of ear whitish. Muzzle, 

 upper lip and chin dark brown. Cheek between eye and lip, and 

 region beneath the ochraceous area under ear dull white, 

 continuous with white of throat. Dorsum of manus and pes 

 a coarse dark grizzle of black, white and tawny. Inner side 

 of hind leg white; outer and posterior side dull ochraceous. Palms 

 and soles dull ochraceous. The gray of the sides of the belly 

 extends down the front of the fore leg to join the gray of the foot. 

 Outer surface of foreleg dull ochraceous. Tail gray heavily shaded 

 with black. A broad, black dorsal stripe aud conspicuous black 

 tip. Under side of tail dull ochraceous. Specimens in worn 

 pelage are less gray than the type, and the tawny areas are brighter 

 and more extensive. 



Skull — The skull of Urocyon guatemalce closely resembles that 

 of U. littoralis, but averages slightly larger. It is much smaller, 

 however, than that of the ordinary gray fox of Mexico north of 

 the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Zygomata slightly less flaring than 

 in U. littoralis. Audital bulla? slightly larger and closer together 

 than in U. littoralis, their longitudinal diameter greater relatively 

 to their transverse diameter. The whole surface of the bulla is 

 more evenly rounded than in other members of the cinereoargenteua 

 group; in this respect showing an approach to U. fratercnlus and 

 U. parvidens. Compared with that of U. parvidens the skull of 




280 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



Urocyon guatemalce is considerably larger, while the audital bulla? 

 are actually as well as relatively smaller. 



Measurements of skull of type. — Greatest length, 111; basal 

 length, 101; basilar length, 98; palatal length (median), 51.4; 

 nasals (median), 33; zygomatic breadth, 60; interorbital breadth. 

 21.4; breadth across postorbital processes, 33; greatest breadth of 

 brain case, 44; mastoid breadth, 40; greatest depth of brain case, 

 33 ; space between audital bullae, 8 ; upper tooth row (exclusive of 

 incisors), 46; mandible, 81; mandibular tooth row (exclusive of 

 incisors), 51. 



Teeth. — The teeth closely resemble those of Urocyon littoralis, 

 but are more robust. This is particularly noticeable in the first 

 molar and the carnassiaJ, the crown of the latter is nearly a milli- 

 metre shorter and broader than in U. littoralis. All the teeth are 

 larger than in U. parvidens, though they are of essentially the 

 same form. 



Measurements. — Type: total length, 830; tail vertebra, 327; 

 hind foot, 128. Average of four specimens from near type local- 

 ity (including type): total length, 827; tail vertebrae, 328; hind 

 foot, 120. A specimen from Tumbala, Chiapas: total length, 

 786; tail vertebra?, 300; hind foot, 111. 



Sjtecimens examined. — Ten, from the following localities: Guate- 

 mala — Nentou, 3; Jacaltenango, 1; exact locality unknown, 5; 

 Chiapas — Tumbala, 1. 



General remarks. — Mexico north of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec 

 is inhabited by gray foxes of large size and pale color, which 

 resemble Urocyon cinereoargenteus scottii Mearns. These animals 

 are replaced south of the Isthmus by U. fratereulvs and U. parvi- 

 dens in the arid tropical region of Yucatan, and by U. guatemalm 

 in the humid tropical region of Guatemala.

THE VOLES COLLECTED BY DE. W. L. ABBOTT IN CENTRAL ASIA. 

 BY GERRIT S. MILLER, JR. 



During three recent expeditions in Central Asia, Dr. W. L. 

 Abbott collected fifty-four voles representing the following ten 

 species. These specimens form part of the large collection of 

 Asiatic mammals which he has presented to the United States 

 National Museum. I publish this paper here by permission of 

 the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

Type locality. — Between Spiti and Pankong lake, eastern 

 Kashmir. 



Specimens collected by Dr. Abbott. — Thirty-four (twenty skins, 

 fourteen in formalin). The specimens were all taken in Ladak, 

 where Dr. Abbott found the species the most abundant vole, com- 

 mon on all grassy plains bordering lakes and streams between the

altitudes of 14,000 feet and 16,000 feet. The following are the 

 exact localities represented : 



Tsokr Chumo (lake), 15,000 feet. 



Rupcheu, Rupshu, 15,000 feet. 



Ooti, Rupshu, 15,500 feet. 



Rupshu, 16,000 feet. 



Hanle district, 16,000 feet. 



Banks of Hanle river, 15,000 feet. 



Chibra, Hanle river, 14,000 feet. 



West side of Pognor lake, 16,000 feet. 



Above Tsomoriri lake, 16,000 feet. 



Karzok, Tsomoriri, altitude not stated. 



Color. — The series of skins shows no considerable variation in 

 color. In summer pelage the back is light woodbrown, strongly 

 tiuged with yellowish, and very faintly darkened by an even 

 sprinkling of long blackish hairs, which in many specimens are 

 more noticeable on neck and region behind shoulders than else- 

 where. Sides clear buff; belly like sides, but paler and irregularly 

 clouded by the appearance on the surface of the dark underfur. 

 Tail pale buff, slightly paler below. Feet dirty white. 1 The autumn 

 coat, which is beginning to appear in specimens taken late in 

 August and early in September, is slightly less yellow. Half- 

 grown young are duller and browner than the adults. These imma- 

 ture specimens show a more strongly contrasted (though actually 

 duller) buffy lateral area. 



Feet. — Both palms and soles are 5-tuberculate. On the soles a 

 rudimentary sixth tubercle is distinguishable in two quarter-growu 

 individuals preserved in formalin. 



Mammce. — On the label of an adult female taken above Tso- 

 moriri, July 31, 1897, Dr. Abbott records the number of mamma? 

 as four pectoral and four inguinal. I find a like number in each 

 of tw T o females preserved in formalin. 



Skull. — The series of fifteen perfect adult skulls shows the slight 

 range of individual variation usually met with in species of Mi- 

 crotia. The most variable characters appear to be the form of the 

 interparietal, the extent of the constriction near the middle of the 

 nasals, the extent of the forward projection of the upper incisors, 

 and the size of the audital bulla?. The development of the audital

bulls© appears to be less in the females, since I find it possible to 

 select the majority of the female skulls in the series by reference to 

 this character aloue. 



Average measurements of five fully adult skulls: greatest 

 length, 29 (28.4-30); basal length, 27.9 (27.6-28.8); basilar 

 length, 26.7 (26-27.4); zygomatic breadth, 18.5 (18-19); mas- 

 toid breadth, 15.2 (15-15.6); interorbital constriction, 4; nasals, 

 7.7 (7.4-8); diastema, 9.3 (9-9.6); palatal length, 15.7 (15- 

 16); occipital depth (in median line), 8.1 (7.6-8.6); fronto- 

 palatal depth (at middle of molar series), 9.1 (9-9.4); mandible, 

 18.5 (18-19); maxillary toothrow (alveoli), 7; mandibular tooth- 

 row (alveoli), 7. 



Teeth. — The euamel pattern is remarkably constant. The last 

 loop of the posterior upper tooth is occasionally somewhat more 



abruptly curved than usual on the outer 

 side so that the last salient angle is cut 

 off as a rudimentary closed triangle. 

 The variation necessary to bring about 

 this result is, however, very trifling. 

 In the front lower molar the exact 

 form of the anterior loop varies slightly, 

 but in none of the twenty specimens is 

 a fourth triangle isolated. 



Remarks. — This species is very closely related to Microtus gtrauchi 

 Biichner. A specimen of the latter from northern Thibet agrees 

 with M. blythi in all particulars except its conspicuously shorter 

 tail. 



Measurements. — The measurements of nineteen specimens of 

 Microtia blythi are given in the following table:

Subgenus MICROTUS Schrank. 

 1798. Microtus Schrank, Fauna Boica, i, p. 72. Type by elimination 

 Microtus tcrrestris Schrank =Mu» arvalis Pallas. 



Dr. Abbott collected two species of the subgenus Microtus, one 

 in eastern Turkestan, the other in the Pamir. Neither has 

 hitherto been described. 



Microtus ravidulus sp. nov. 



Type adult 9 (skin and skull), No. 62,159, United States 

 National Museum, collected at Okchi, valley of the Aksai (alti- 

 tude, 7000 feet), eastern Turkestan, November 7, 1893, by Dr. 

 W. L. Abbott. 



Collector's measurement. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 285 



General characters. — In general appearance much like Microti** 

 arvalis from Braunschweig, Germany, but tail shorter, fur longer 

 and coarser, color paler, and skull longer and narrower. Enamel 

 pattern as in M. arvalis. Mammae, 8; plantar tubercles, 6; hip 

 glands conspicuous. 



Far and Color. — The fur is harsh and coarse, that on middle of 

 hack about 12 mm. in length. It is everywhere dark slaty plum- 

 beous at base. 



Ground color of dorsal surface buff, faintly tinged with wood- 

 brown and coarsely ' lined ' with blackish brown. Sides clear 

 pale buff Ventral surface creambuff much darkened, especially 

 anteriorly, bv the plumbeous bases of the hairs. Tail indistinctly 

 bicolor, soiled whitish below, brownish above. Feet dirty white. 



Feet. — Palms with five tubercles, soles with six ; all well devel- 

 oped. Soles densely hairy behind tubercles. 



Mamma. — Mammae eight, four pectoral and four inguinal, as 

 usual in the subgenus Microtus. 



Si: nil. — The skull of Microtus ravidulus, though of the same 

 type as that of M. arvalis from Germany, is readily distinguishable 

 by its slightly greater length, and by the narrowness and great 

 depth of the braincase. The form of the braincase is much like 

 that of M. ( ' Pedum ys) austerus. Iuterorbital constriction narrow, 

 the constricted region unusually long. Zygomatic arches not 

 widely flaring, the outer borders nearly parallel (not strongly 

 convergent anteriorly as in M. arvalis ) in the region opposite post- 

 orbital processes. Rostrum heavier than in M. arvalis, but not 

 conspicuously different in form. Audita! bullae slightly larger than 

 in M. arvalis. Mandible similar to that of M. arvalis, but larger 

 and with more slender angular process. 



Average measurements of three adult skulls: greatest length, 



26.3 mm. (26-26.6) ; basal length, 25. 1 ( 25-25.4) ; basilar length, 



23.4 (23-23.6); zygomatic breadth, 14.4 (14-14.6); mastoid 

 breadth, 11.6 (11.4-12); interorbital constriction, 3; nasals, 7: 

 diastema, 8; palatal length, 14; occipital depth, 8; fronto-palatal 

 depth (at middle of molar series), 8.1 (8-8.4); mandible, 16.1 

 (16-16.4); maxillary tooth row (alveoli), 6; mandibular tooth 

 row (alveoli), 6. 



Teeth. — The teeth of Microti/* ravidulus are relatively slightly 




286

[1899. 



Fig.

 pamirensis (lower figures). (X t>.) 



larger than in M. arvalis, but the enamel pattern in the two species 

 is identical. 



Specimens examined. — Five, all from the type locality. 



Remark*. — Although a member of another subgenus, Microtia 

 ravidulus bears a strong superficial resemblance to M. bhjthi. The 

 colors of the two species are almost precisely the same, but M. 

 ravidulus, aside from its subgeneric characters, can be distinguished 

 by the dark dorsal surface of the tail, coarser fur, and more con- 

 spicuous dark ' fining ' of back. 



The four skins show no important variations in color. 



Mii-rotas ravidulus is closely related to M. tiansehanicus Biichner 

 from the Juldus Valley. In size, color and cranial characters the 

 two species apparently agree perfectly; but the five specimens of 

 M. ravidulus have the front lower molar of M. arvalis instead of 

 the very peculiar tooth described and figured by Biichner as occur- 

 ring without exception in the seven specimens of M. tiansehanicus 

 collected by Przewalski. In only one of the latter is there a faint 

 trace of a fourth outer salient angle; and this tooth is specially 

 figured as abnormal. Although both animals occur on the south 

 side of the great Tianschan mountain chain, they are some four 

 hundred miles apart, and probably completely insulated by the 

 Chalyk and Beschan mountains, which would undoubtedly act as 

 barriers to austral species. 



Dr. Abbott tells me that this vole was abundant in the grain 

 fields of the comparatively low, fertile valley about Okchi. It 

 occurred together with a species of Oricetulus, and one or both of 

 the animals laid up abundant underground stores, each containing 

 about a pint of barley heads. Strangely enough, this habit was 

 not known to the owners of the fields.

Microtus pamirensis sp. now 



Type adult tf (skin and skull), No. 62,161, United States 

 National Museum, collected at Tagdumbash, Pamir (altitude 

 12,000 feet), June 18, 1894, by Dr. W. L. Abbott. 



General characters. — Size medium; tail short; ears moderate, 

 scarcely overtopping fur; color uniform pale brown above, whitish 

 below; skull heavily built and angular; upper incisors conspicu- 

 ously protruding ; two anterior triangles in first lower molar open ; 

 posterior loop of back upper molar nearly straight. 



Fur and color. — The fur is full and soft, that on middle of back 

 about 12 mm. in length. It is everywhere slategray at base. 



Color of dorsal surface light broccolibrown, very uniform and 

 only inconspicuously sprinkled with darker hairs. Ventral surface 

 grayish white, strongly clouded anteriorly by the dark bases of the 

 hairs. Feet whitish. Tail whitish with a very inconspicuous 

 dusky dorsal stripe. 



■Feet. — The soles and palms were slit open by the collector, so 

 that it is impossible to determine the number and position of the 

 tubercles. Claws as in typical members of the subgenus Microtus. 



Skull. — The skull of Microtus pamirensis is unlike that of any 

 other true Microtus with which I am acquainted. In superficial

appearance it strongly suggests an approach to Phaiomys. This is 

 due chiefly to the protruding upper incisors and the short, strongly 

 cuneate nasals. The whole skull is angular and heavily built, 

 much broader than that of M. arvalis, from Germany, though of 

 about the same length. Nasals shorter than in M. arvalis, and 

 much broader anteriorly. Zygomatic arches strongly flaring ante- 

 riorly, nearly parallel in region opposite postorbital processes. 

 Interparietal rectangular, the anteroposterior breadth about half 

 the lateral breadth. Braincase squarish in outline, broader than 

 in M. arvalis, but of about the same depth. Interorbital constric- 

 tion relatively less narrow than in M. arvalis, but constricted region 

 of about the same length. Palate normal, the lateral pits well 

 developed, though shallower than in M. arvalis. Audital bullae 

 about the same size as in M. arvalis, but flatter. Incisive foramen 

 considerably broader anteriorly than posteriorly. 



Measurements of type skull: gi'eatest length, 25; basal length, 

 14.6; basilar length, 14; zygomatic breadth, 16; mastoid breadth, 

 12.4; interorbital constriction, 3.8; length of nasals, 7; anterior 

 breadth across nasals, 3.6; posterior breadth across nasals, 1;

 palatal depth (at middle of molar series), 8; mandible, 17; maxil- 

 lary toothrow (alveoli), 6.8; mandibular toothrow (alveoli), 6.6. 



Teeth. — Attention has already been called to the strongly pro- 

 jecting upper incisors. The molars are heavier than in M. arvalis. 

 In general appearance the enamel pattern is less compact than in 

 31. arvalis, while the details in the two species differ considerably. 

 The posterior upper molar contains an anterior transverse loop, 

 a small outer closed triangle, a larger one on the inner side, and 

 a long terminal longitudinal loop provided with a well-developed 

 salient angle on each side anteriorly. Behind each of these salient 

 angles is a rounded reentrant angle. As the inner of these salient 

 angles and its corresponding reentrant angle are the more strongly 

 developed as well as the more posterior in position the terminal 

 loop is bowed very slightly inward. It is, however, essentially 

 straight as compared with the corresponding region in 31. arvalis. 

 Middle upper molar tetramerodont. The front lower molar con- 

 tains the same elements as in 31. arvalis, but the two anterior 

 triangles open freely into the terminal loop. This character may 

 prove to be individual, though I am inclined to believe that it is

normal. The enamel pattern of the remaining teeth is like that 

 of M. arvalis. 



Specimens examined. — Dr. Abbott collected only one specimen of 

 this species. 



Remarks. — Microtus pamirensis differs too widely from any de- 

 scribed form to require detailed comparison.

During his first and second visits to Kashmir, Dr. Abbott col- 

 lected the five specimens that subsequently formed the basis of the 

 descriptions of Microtus fertilis and of the subgenus Hyperacrius. 

 During his last expedition he obtained another specimen which 

 differs so considerably from those previously collected that it must 

 be regarded as the representative of an undescribed species. The 

 three species of Hyperacrius now known may be recognized by the 

 following characters :

Specimens collected. — Dr. Abbott has taken no specimens of this 

 species in addition to the original series of five skins procured dur- 

 ing his first and second visits to Kashmir. These were taken at 

 the following localities :

Kaj Nag mountains, 8,000 feet. 

 Krishnagunga valley, 7,000 feet. 

 Central Kashmir, 12,000 feet. 



This species occurs in the mountain parks well below timber 

 line. From the information given me by Dr. Abbott I should 

 suppose that its faunal position is lower boreal. In the middle 

 boreal and upper boreal it is replaced by members of the subgenera 

 Phaiomys and Alticola. 



Color. — The five skins show no marked variation in color. In 

 all, the entire dorsal surface is a fine grizzle of dull woodbrown and 

 sealbrown, the result of which is a general tint not far from sepia. 

 Such variation as occurs is due to slight differences in the balance 

 between the component colors. On the sides and belly the seal- 

 brown disappears, and the woodbrown changes to a yellowish clay 

 color, varying slightly in intensity and in the amount of clouding 

 due to the dark bases of the hairs. Tail obscurely bicolor, sepia 

 above, dirty whitish beneath. Feet dusky sepia, varying consider- 

 ably in depth; occasionally almost blackish. 



Skull. — Three skulls show little variation beyond that due to 

 differences in age. The skull of the type is the oldest and most 



angular. It measures: greatest length, 

 24.6 ; basal length 24; basilar length, 

 23 ; zygomatic breadth, 16 ; mastoid 

 breadth, 12.4; interorbital constriction, 

 3.8: length of nasals, 8 ; anterior breadth 

 across nasals, 3.2 ; posterior breadth

General characters. — Precisely similar to Microtus fertilis (True), 

 but with much smaller ears. 



Fur and color. — In length and quality of fur as well as in color

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



291 



the types of Microtus fertilis and 31. brachelix resemble each other 

 so exactly that it would be difficult to fiud two skius more perfectly 

 alike. 



Ears. — The ears are small, much overtopped by the surrounding 

 fur. while in M. fertilis they are about equal to the fur in length. 

 The reduction in height is especially noticeable along the upper 

 edge of the anterior border, which is reduced to the merest rim. 



Skull and teeth. — In cranial and dental characters Microtus 

 brachelix agrees perfectly with M. fertilis. 



Remarks. — I should hesitate to separate Microtus brachelix from 

 M. fertilis on the single character of the size of the ears, did not 

 the five specimens of the latter show perfect uniformity among 

 themselves. Even in a half -grown specimen of M. fertilis the ears 

 are much larger than in the type of M. brachelix. 



Measurements. — The measurements of the type of Microtus 

 brachelix and of five specimens of M. fertilis are given in the fol- 

 lowing table :

have thus far been described, two of them based on material 

 obtained by Dr. Abbott during his first visit to Baltistan and 

 Kashmir. While in Ladak during 1893 and 1897 Dr. Abbott 

 secured two additional species, both of which appear to be unde- 

 scribed. The species now known, with their type localities, are as 

 follows :

Type locality. — Central Kashmir. Altitude, 11,000 feet, 

 Specimens collected. — Dr. Abbott obtained only one specimen of 

 this species, the type, a half -grown male. 



Remarks. — Microtus montosus is very doubtfully distinct from M. 

 roylei, also from Kashmir. The type and only known specimen is 

 young — scarcely more than half-grown — so that its true characters 

 cannot be determined with certainty; but I am unable to see that 

 it differs from M. roylei, as described by Blanford, in any way 

 not to be accounted for by its immaturity.

Type locality. — Braldu valley, Baltistan. 



Specimens collected. — Dr. Abbott took only one specimen of 

 Microtus albicauda. 



Skull. — The skull of the type measures: greatest length, 26.4; 

 basal length, 24.4; basilar length, 23; zygomatic breadth, 15; 

 mastoid breadth, 13.4; interorbital constriction, 4.4; length of

 depth, 7.6; fronto-palatal depth .(at middle of molar series), 7; 

 mandible, 16; maxillary tooth row (alveoli), 6.6; mandibular 

 tooth row (alveoli), 6.4. 



Bemarks. — Microtus albicauda is apparently most closely related 

 to M. stracheyi and M. crieetulus. With both of these it agrees in 

 color and in general size. From the former it is separable by its 

 simpler m 1, from the latter by its more complex m 3, longer tail 

 and more lightly built skull. From M. blanfordi it is distinguish- 

 able at a glance by its shorter, more closely haired, entirely white 

 tail. 



Measurements. — For measurements of Microtus albicauda see 

 table, p. 298.

National Museum, collected on the banks of the Tso Kyun, Ladak 



(altitude, 16,000 feet), August 11, 1897, by Dr. W. L Abbott. 



General characters. — Similar to Microtus albicauda (True), but 



with more heavily built skull and much shorter tail. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 295 



Fur and color. — Fur full and soft, that on middle of back 10 

 mm. to 13 mm. in length. 



Dorsal surface pale smokegray, strongly tinged with woodbrown 

 and faintly darkened by a sprinkling of blackish hairs. Ventral 

 surface of body and back of feet pure white, irregularly clouded 

 by the plumbeous bases of the hairs. A narrow lateral line ex- 

 tending down hind legs to ankles, crossing buttocks, and including 

 whole of tail, pale creambuff. Front legs white. 



Ears. — The ears are well developed, slightly overtopping the 

 fur. They show no peculiarities in form. 



Feet. — Palms with five tubercles, soles with six; all well devel- 

 oped. Soles densely furred behind tubercles. 



Skull. — The skull of Microtus cricetulus is in all respects that of 

 a typical Alt-kola. The brain case is rounded in outline when 

 viewed from above, the interorbital region is broad, with a distinct 

 median furrow, and the nasals are very large. Postorbital pro- 

 cesses small but distinct. Viewed from the side, the skull is strongly 

 cuneate in outline, owing to the nearly flat dorsal profile, deep 

 brain case, prominent audital bulla?, and slender rostrum. It differs 

 from the skull of M. albicauda, its nearest ally, in slightly larger 

 size, a little more highly arched brain case, and in the larger size 

 and more anterior position of the rostral protuberances. The nasal 

 branches of the premaxillaries are narrower than in M. albicauda. 

 They terminate on a line with the posterior extremity of the 

 nasals, while in M. albicauda they extend considerably behind the 

 nasals. 



Measurements of type skull: greatest length, 28; basal length, 

 26.6; basilar length, 25; zygomatic breadth, 16; mastoid breadth, 

 13.4; interorbital constriction, 4; length of nasals, 9; anterior 

 breadth across nasals, 4; posterior breadth across nasals, 2; dias- 

 tema, 9; palatal length, 13.4; occipital depth, 8; fronto-palatal 

 depth (at middle of molar series), 7; mandible, 17; maxillary 

 tooth row (alveoli), 6; mandibular tooth row (alveoli), 6. 



Teeth. — Both upper and lower incisors are very pale yellow on 

 their anterior faces, contrasting strongly with the deep orange 

 incisors of M. albicauda. Molars noticeably heavier than in M. 

 albicauda, but enamel pattern, with a single exception, exactly the 

 same. In M. albicauda the inner base of the posterior loop of the 

 back upper molar is produced into a conspicuous salient angle. In 




296 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



M. cricetulus this angle is completely absent, no trace of it appear- 

 ing in any of the four specimens. The character, however, may 

 prove to be inconstant when large series of specimens are available 

 for comparison. 



Specimens examined. — Four, from the following localities in 

 Ladak : 



Banks of the Tso Kyun, Rupshu, 16,000 feet. 



Above Kiangchu Maidar, Rupshu. 



Rupshu, 16,000 feet. 



Measurements. — For measurements of Microtus cricetulus see 

 table, p. 298. 



Microtus acrophilus sp. nov. 



Type adult 9 (skin and skull) No. 62,162, United States 

 National Museum, collected on the Ladak side of the Kara 

 Korum Pass (altitude 17,000 feet) July 25, 1893, by Dr. W. L. 

 Abbott. 



General characters. — Closely related to Microtus stoliczhanus 

 Blanford, but with shorter tail and much paler color. 



Fur and color. — Fur full and soft, about 15 mm. long on middle 

 of back. Basal two-thirds of hairs slaty plumbeous, slightly paler 

 than in Microtus albicauda and M. cricetulus. On the dorsal sur- 

 face the plumbeous basal area is followed by a broad band of 

 pinkish buff which gives the general tone to the pelage. Through- 

 out the dorsal surface the fur is sprinkled with longer dark brown 

 hairs, but these are nowhere conspicuous. The buff is brightest 

 on the head and lumbar region, paler and grayer across shoulders, 

 along sides and on rump. Belly snowy white, much clouded by the 

 plumbeous under fur. Feet and tail dirty white. 



Ears. — The ears are of about the same size as in M. cricetulus, 

 but owing to the longer surrounding fur they appear much shorter 

 and less conspicuous. 



Feet. — Palms 5-tuberculate ; soles 6-tuberculate. All tubercles 

 very large. Soles densely hairy behind tubercles. 



Mammas. — Mamma? eight, four pectoral and four inguinal. 



Skull. — The skull of Microtus acrophilus is similar in general 

 form to that of M. albicauda and M. cricetulus, but is slightly 

 larger than either, and much more massively built. Zygomatic 

 arches shorter, and rostrum broader and deeper than in M. albi- 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 297 



cauda or M. cricetulus. Nasal branches of premaxillaries narrow, 

 scarcely reaching posterior edge of nasals. Mandible larger than 

 in M. cricetulus, but with much more slender angular process. 



Measurements of type skull: greatest length, 28; basal length, 

 27; basilar length, 25.4; zygomatic breadth, 16.4; mastoid 

 breadth, 13; interorbital constriction, 5 ; length of nasals, 8.8; 

 anterior breadth across nasals, 3.8; posterior breadth across nasals, 

 2; diastema, 8.8; palatal length, 14; occipital depth, 8.4; 

 fronto-palatal depth (at middle of molar series), 7.4; mandible, 

 18; maxillary toothrow (alveoli), 7; mandibular toothrow (alve- 

 oli), 6.8. 



Teeth. — Incisors pale yellow as in M. cricetulus. Molars much 

 heavier than in M. cricetulus, but enamel pattern exactly similar. 9 

 The salient angles are, however, less acute, and the terminal loop 

 of the posterior upper molar forms less than half of the length of 

 the tooth crown instead of slightly more than half as in M. albi- 

 cauda and M. cricetulus. 



Specimens examined. — Dr. Abbott took only one specimen of 

 Microtus acrophilus. On the label he writes: " Vast numbers 

 inhabit the cliff of conglomerate at sides of the nullah, issuing 

 forth at evening. Country absolutely destitute of vegetation." 



Remarks. — This species is closely related to Microtus stoliczkanus, 

 but is readily distinguishable by its short tail and very pallid color. 



Measurements. — The measurements of the type of Microtus 

 acrophilus are given in the accompanying table:

A NEW SPECIES OF COCCYZUS FROM ST. ANDREWS. 

 BY WITMER STONE. 



The first collection of birds from the isolated island of St. 

 Andrews in the Caribbean Sea seems to have been made in the 

 winter of 1886-7, by Mr. Robert Henderson, who was collecting 

 for Mr. Charles B. Cory. 



Nineteen species were obtained, of which five were described as 

 new by Mr. Cory. 1 



On May 1, 1887, Dr. William L. Abbott stopped at the island 

 and collected a few specimens representing six species. 



Two of these were not obtained by Mr. Henderson, namely, 

 Lampomis violicauda and a Coccyzus allied to C. minor, but appar- 

 ently distinct, for which I would propose the name Coccyzus abbotti. 



This bird differs from C. minor especially in its much longer bill, 

 and this character, curiously euough, is likewise conspicuous in 

 Mimus magnirodris aud Icterus laicrencei, two other peculiar species 

 separated by Mr. Cory.

302 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



ON A COLLECTION OF BIRDS FROM THE VICINITY OF BOGOTA, WITH A 



REVIEW OF THE SOUTH AMERICAN SPECIES OF SPEOTYTO 



AND TROGLODYTES. 



SY WITHER STONE. 



Through the generosity of Dr. Samuel G. Dixon, President of 

 the Academy, the institution has come into possession of a collec- 

 tion of birds made in 1888-89, by the late Dr. J. W. Detwiller 

 in the vicinity of Bogota, Colombia. So many specimens have been 

 obtained from this region that a list of the species adds but few to 

 those already recorded in Bogota collections. The fact, however, 

 that these specimens, with but few exceptions, are marked with 

 definite localities renders them of greater importance as throwing 

 some light upon the distribution of the species. 



The principal points at which specimens were obtained are 

 Honda, on the Magdalena river, seventy miles northwest of Bo- 

 gota; Ambalema, farther up the Magdalena, about forty miles 

 from Bogota; Ibague, ninety miles west, on the slopes of the 

 central Cordilleras, and on the Nevada del Tolima, about twenty 

 miles west of Ibague. A few were also collected at Villa Vicencia 

 east of the eastern Cordilleras in the Territory of San Martin, 

 sixty miles southeast of Bogota, and on the headwaters of the 

 Meta, a branch of the Orinoco. 



The list follows. Unless otherwise stated only one specimen was 

 secured, and where no locality is mentioned the labels have been 

 lost.

Speotyto cunicularia tolimae sub. sp. nov. 



Five specimens secured May 27, 1889, on the Plain of Tolima, 

 where they were breeding and had eggs at this date. 



Type No. 35,239, Coll. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., Q. March 27, 

 1889. 



Smaller and darker than any of the other forms of Speotyto with 

 less white above, approaching nearest to 8. brachyptera Puchm., 

 from Margarita Island, Venezuela. General ground color above 

 dark Prout's brown to almost sepia, spots on margins of remiges 

 mainly buff, on coverts and scapulars white. Forehead and throat 

 pure white. Five narrow buff bands on the tail and narrow buff 

 tips to the feathers. The bars on the abdomen are somewhat 

 broken and irregular, and are dark brown edged narrowly with 

 cinnamon. Length of wing, 6 ins. 



There seem to be at least five races of Burrowing Owls in South 

 America as follows : 



1. S. cunicularia (Molina). 

 Type locality. Chile 1. 



Distributed over the southern part Of the continent from Chile 

 and Uruguay southward. It differs from all the more northern 

 forms in its larger size, and in the large amount of white on the 

 outer tail feathers. In these the ground color is white with rather 

 narrow brown cross bars. S. patagonica Peale and S. urucurea 

 Lesson, I take to be synonyms of this form. 



All the more northern birds that I have seen are smaller and 

 darker, with the ground color of the outer tail feathers brown, 

 marked with white spots on the sides. These spots are sometimes 

 nearly confluent into bands, but the white never surpasses the brown 

 in extent as in S. cunicularia. 



2. S. c. grallaria (Spix). 

 (Type loc., Para, Brazil). 



Apparently agrees with the characters just given — thus differ- 

 ing from cunicularia. I have been unable to examine speci- 

 mens of the Brazilian bird and am forced 1o rely upon descrip- 

 tions, so that I am unable to show in what respects this differs 

 from the following. From its geograpical range it is almost 

 certainlv distinct. 




304 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



3. S. c. nanodes Berl. and Stolzm. P. Z. S., 1892, p. 388. 

 (Type loc, Lima, Peru.) 



This is the bird identified by Peale and Cassin as grallaria, and 

 they have been followed provisionally by Ridgway. On geograph- 

 ical grounds it is extremely doubtful that this is identical with the 

 Brazilian form, and I think the authors have done well to sep- 

 arate it. 



The U. S. Exploring Expedition specimens are much bleached, 

 but otherwise agree with Berlepsch's description. 



4. S. c. tolimae Stone. 



(Type loc., Tolima, Colombia.) 



Smaller and darker than the last, as above described. In 

 nanodes the white on the outer tail feathers generally extends across 

 as distinct bands and the brown bands are of nearly uniform width 

 throughout. In tolima, however, the brown bands are wider in 

 the middle, and confluent along the shaft, separating the white into 

 rounded spots. 



On the middle tail feathers, the buff cross bands are extremely 

 narrow in tolimie (.10-. 12 in.), and do not reach the outer mar- 

 gins of the feathers, while in nanodes they are broad (.20-. 25 in. ), 

 and extend to the margin.

Troglodytes striatulus Lafr. 



Honda, two specimens. 

 Troglodytes columbae sp. nov. 



Type 35,354, Coll. Acad. Nat. Sci. Vicinity of Bogota. 



It is with some hesitation that I add another to the long list of 

 names proposed for South American "Wrens, but this is so different 

 from any described form that there seems no alternative. 



This bird is nearest to T. striatulus, but is darker and more olive 

 brown above, without a trace of the rufous tints so characteristic 

 of South American species of Troglodytes. T. striatulus is practi- 

 cally without rufous tints, but the feathers of the rump or upper 

 tail coverts as well as the tail are lighter and incline to rufous or 

 yellowish brown. There is no trace of this, however, in T. colum- 

 boz, both rump and tail being dark olive brown. The black bands 

 on the tail are rather more irregular than in striatulus and those on 

 the back are a little more pronounced. The under surface is quite as 

 different from T. striatulus as are the upper parts; it is uniform 

 ochraceous or vinaceous from the chin to the vent without a trace 

 of white, and no trace of fulvous on the flanks which are uniform 

 in ground color with the rest of the lower surface. The sides and 

 flanks are shaded with olive brown and obscurely banded. The 

 under tail coverts are buffy, with a slight rufous tinge, and are 

 strongly barred with black. The bars do not quite reach the edges 

 of the feathers, and are connected down the shaft. The sides of 

 the head are almost exactly like T. striatulus, but with the ground 

 color darker. Length of wing, 2.15 ins. 



This is the darkest Troglodytes that I have seen from South or 



1 It is possible this, as well as some others of the unlabelled specimens, 

 came from Cartagena. See pp. 312-13. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 309 



Central America, and can be recognized at a glance from any of 

 the other species. 



Though its dark under surface makes it appear very different 

 from the white-throated and white-bellied T. striatulus, it is evi- 

 dently most closely allied to that species. 



Unfortunately, the label has been lost from the specimen, so that 

 the exact locality is unknown. 



The identification of this bird involved a study of all the South 

 and Central American species of Troglodytes, and an examination 

 of the specimens in the collections of the Academy and the U. S. 

 National Museum, the latter having been kindly loaned me for the 

 purpose. 



While the material is insufficient for a monograph, the results of 

 the investigation may be of value to those engaged in studying this 

 rather perplexing group. 



The tropical American species of Troglodytes may at once be sep- 

 arated into two groups, those with distinct superciliaries, sharply 

 defined against the color of the head, and those with supercdiaries 

 indistinct. The first are not difficult, and stand as given in the 

 British Museum Catalogue, Vol. vi, p. 248. The other group is 

 much more confusing. 



From southern Mexico to Panama south of the range of T. 

 aedon and its races, we have a Wren with rufous-tinted rump and 

 tail, and vinaceous below, with under tail coverts strongly barred 

 with black, white and vinaceous. This is T. intermedins Cab. in 

 Nicaragua and northern Costa Rica (type loc, San Jose) and T. 

 inquietus Baird, in Costa Rica and Panama (type loc, Panama), 

 the more southern form differing in larger size. 



The two are, however, so close that it seems undesirable to sep- 

 arate them. 



In the vicinity of Bogota we fiud a totally different bird, T. 

 striatulns, which compared Avith the preceding is olive brown instead 

 of reddish brown above, and much lighter beneath, being pure white 

 on the throat and middle of the abdomen. The under tail coverts 

 are banded with black and white. 



Next to this comes the very much darker T. columbce Stone 

 above described. 



The rest of South America is inhabited by various races of one 

 wide-ranging form, all of which are peculiar in their strongly 




310 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



rufous tail contrasting with the browner tint of the back and the 



strongly rufous under tail coverts and thighs, the former with the 



bars much reduced and sometimes nearly wanting. 



Many names have been proposed for the birds of this group, of 



which the following seem to be recognizable. 



1. Troglodytes musculus Naum. Vogel's Deutschlaud, 1823. 



T. furvus Wiedii Berl. 

 T. platensis Wied. 



Distribution. — Brazil, Argentine and Uruguay (type loc, Bahia, 

 Brazil). 



This is the darkest form, with obscure bars of blackish on the 

 back always present. Under surface vinaceous, darker and inclin- 

 ing to rufous on the flanks and under tail coverts, but not nearly 

 so tawny as in the west-coast races. Under tail coverts barred or 

 distinctly spotted with black, in direct Contrast to the nearly uni- 

 form rufous-coverts of the western races. 



This bird has been frequently called T. furvus Gm. , but I agree 

 with Sharpe and Allen in the impossibility of satisfactorily identi- 

 fying the " Brown Warbler " of Brown's Illustrations of Zoology, 

 upon which Gmelin based his name. Berlepsch seems to have 

 regarded the Guiana bird (rufulus) as true "furvus," and renamed 

 this form T. f. Wiedii, claiming that although Wied' s description 

 of T. platensis is unquestionably this form, it is not Sylvia platensis 

 Lath., which he quotes. T. musculus Naum antedates Berlepsch' s 

 name, and must of course be adopted. 



2. Troglodytes musculus rufulus Cab. Schomb., Reis. Guian., iii, p. 672 (1848). 

 T. tobagensis Lawr. 



Distribution. — Guiana, Venezuela and N. E. Colombia (type 

 loc, Roraima, Guiana). 



This is a light-colored race banded on the back as in T. musculus, 

 but much paler and sometimes quite white below. 



3. Troglodytes musculus rex (Berl. and Leverk). 

 Distribution. — Eastern Bolivia (type loc, Samarpata). 

 A pale form of musculus. 



4. Troglodytes musculus homensis (Less.). 

 T. rosaceus Less. 



T. pallida Lafr. and d'Orb. 

 T. magellanicus Gould. 



Distribution. — Chile and Patagonia. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 311 



The Wrens of the Pacific coast of South America are paler than 

 true musculus, and are .generally without bars on the back, and 

 with the under tail coverts nearly or quite uniform tawny, the 

 flanks and rump are also much more conspicuously tawny and the 

 whole plumage paler. The specimens I have examined from 

 Patagonia and Chile are darker than those from Callao, Peru, 

 which seem to be T. m. audax. If this determination is correct, 

 then T. m. audax is the lightest colored, most rufous of the genus, 

 and T. hornensis is intermediate between that and T. musculus. If 

 homensis and audax are both based on pale-colored birds, then 

 they may have to be regarded as synonyms, and T. magellanicm 

 revived for the darker more southern birds. 



T. hornensis is usually described as very pale and rufous, in 

 which case I cannot separate it from T. audax of Callao. Sharpe 

 (Cat. Bds., vi, p. 207) seems to regard T. audax as not deter- 

 minable; if this view is followed then probably hornensis and 

 magellanicus should be adopted as above. 



The darker Chilean birds which I here regard as T. hornensis 

 are lighter than musculus with more tawny tail, under tail coverts 

 with but few spots and back without bars. 



5. Troglodytes musculus audax (Tschudi). 



Distribution. — Coast of Peru (type loc, Peru). 



Palest of the group; rump, flank and tail very bright tawny, 

 and dark bars on the tail indistinct and suffused with the prevail- 

 ing tawny tint. No bars on the back. 



6. Troglodytes musculus tecellatus (Lafr. and d'Orb.). 

 (?) T. murinus Less. 



Distribution. — Peru (type loc, Tacna). 



This is a darker bird with distinct cross bars on the back differ- 

 ing in this respect from all the other trans- Andean forms. From 

 musculus it differs in being much mox-e rufous both above and below. 

 The tail is very distinctly barred Avith black, presenting a very 

 different appearance from that of T. audax. Mr. Ridgway states 

 that the specimens in the Lafresnay collection labelled as the 

 types of this species are in reality T. brwineicollis of Mexico. 

 The labels must have been confused, however, as the description is 

 certainly not from that bird. 




312 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



7. Troglodytes musculus puna (Berl. and Stolz.). 

 Distribution. — Highlands of Peru (type loc., Queta). 

 Larger than T. musculus and color below not at all rufescent. 



Under tail coverts with very few spots. 



8. Troglodytes musculus albicans (Berl. and Tacz.). 

 Distribution. — Ecuador (type loc. , Guaquil). 



Throat and middle of abdomen pure white, paler and grayer above 

 than musculus and sides more rufescent. 



The last two and T. m. rex I have not seen, and am therefore in 

 much doubt as to the forms from Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia. If 

 tecellata, puna and audax all occur in Peru, and are perfectly 

 separable, they must occupy very different geographic areas. 



The confusion of the tropical American Wrens in the published 

 Avorks is very perplexing. The Biologia Centrali Americana 

 recognizes but two forms of the group here treated, i. e., T. 

 intermedins of Central America and T. furvus of South America! 

 The British Museum Catalogue is much better, but it is difficult to 

 imagine how Dr. Sharpe can unite the Wrens of Panama and 

 Bogota under T. striatulus and separate T. intermedins. The 

 Panama birds which I have seen are scarcely distinguishable from 

 T. intermedins, while the true striatulus from Bogota is very 

 different.

1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 313 



Cyanophaia goudoti (Bourc). 



Three specimens doubtfully referred to this species. They are a 

 little smaller than the specimen from Ibague mentioned above, 

 which is evidently an adult male; and also differ in having the 

 lower part of the abdomen and flanks grayish white, and the back 

 more bronze tinted, one specimen especially showing brilliant 

 coppery reflections. The under tail coverts are greener than in 

 the Ibague specimen, which is exactly the reverse of the supposed 

 females described in the British Museum Catalogue, xvi, p. 235. 



While these may be females or young of C. goudoti, it seems quite 

 likely that they represent a northern race of this bird.

NOTES ON A FEW NORTHWEST AMERICAN LAND SNAILS. 



BY HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



Through the kindness of the Rev. George W. Taylor, I have 

 recently been able to examine some of the smaller land snails of 

 Alberta and British Columbia, and to compare them with types or 

 typical specimens of species originally described from the United 

 States. In most cases the northwestward extension of these forms 

 has already been recorded by Mr. Taylor, in several valuable lists 

 published by him in Canada. A few have not hitherto been 

 noticed in print. 



"Vitrea biimeyana Morse. 



The specimen from Nanaimo, Vancouver Island, agrees exactly 

 with those from Maine, but the shell reported from Nanaimo as 

 Patula (Pbinogyra) asteriscus is not that very distinct Maine shell, 

 but Punetwn clappi Pilsbry. This extends its northward range a 

 considerable distance. Mr. Taylor believes that he collected the 

 typical asteriscus at Comox, B. C, twelve years ago. I have not 

 seen these specimens. 



Vertigo gouldii lagganensis n. v. Fig. 1. 



Resembles V. gouldii in size and general characters, but the 

 form is more slender ; palatal teeth subequal, the lower one more 

 immersed ; upper segment or ' ' auricle ' ' of the outer lip much 

 more pronounced. Alt. 2.1, diam. of last whorl above aperture 

 1.17 mm. 



Laggan, Alberta, collected by the Rev. George "W. Taylor. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 315 



V. ventricosa, to which this form was formerly referred by Mr. 

 Taylor, is a very much more ventricose, shorter species, with 

 shorter palatal folds. 



Pupa decora Gld. also occurs at Laggan, the specimens having 

 formerly been recorded thence as P. hoppii. It is evidently a 

 wide spread species in British America and Canada, as specimens in 

 the collection of the Academy from Labrador, Alberta and Alaska 

 attest. 



Among other interesting shells received from Mr. F. H. Andrus, 

 were examples of an apparently new Vertigo, a description of 

 Avhich follows: 



Vertigo andrusiana n. sp. Fig. 3. 



Shell cylindrical ovate, but slightly tapering above, obtuse; 

 glossy, of a dark chestnut color, becoming lighter and somewhat 

 gray on the upper whorls. Whorls 5-A-, moderately convex, the 

 last with a moderate crest or ridge, and then a rather wide con- 

 striction behind the slightly expanded lip, a slight furrow crossing 

 the constriction and terminating in a slight entering angle on the 

 outer lip. Aperture rounded and truncate, obstructed by five 

 white teeth; the parietal rather high, short, the columellar situated 

 rather high, a small denticle close to the base of the columella, and 

 two subequal palatal laminae (their positions indicated by slight 

 indentations outside), the lower one more deeply situated. Alt. 

 2.46, diam. of last whorl above aperture 1.33 mm. 



Douglas county, southwestern Oregon, collected by Mr. F. H. 

 Andrus. 



Compared with V. binneyana Sterki, this species differs in being 

 much larger, with the outer lip scarcely incurved to define an 

 upper arc of the peristome, and with the palatal folds subequal, 

 the lower one not conspicuously longer. It resembles Pupa decora 

 Gld. somewhat in size and color, but is readily separated by the 

 different dentition of the aperture and the transverse groove 

 behind the lip characteristic of Vertigo. 



For comparison I figure a specimen of V. binneyana (fig. 2) 

 from Winnipeg, Manitoba, JSb. 60,465, Coll. Acad. Nat. Sci. 

 Phila. Shells from Helena, Mont., and Seattle, Wash., are 

 perceptibly more cylindrical than that figured.

 SALAMANDER OF THE FAMILY DESMOGNATHIDJE. 



BY J. PERCY MOORE. 



The family Desruognathidse was established by Prof. Cope for 

 the American genus Desmognathus, of which four species are now 

 known. Boulenger associated with Desmognathus the Mexican 

 genus Thorius (which Cope had regarded as constituting a distinct 

 family), a view which was later accepted by Cope. Stejneger has 

 added a third genus, Typhlotriton, an interesting blind salamander 

 which occurs in the caves of Missouri. 



Among some salamanders collected by me in the mountains of 

 North Carolina are three specimens of a fourth genus which is now 

 described. 



LEUROGNATHUS gen. nov. 



With the osteological characters of the Desmognathidse ; vertebra? 

 opisthocoelous ; carpus and tarsus cartilaginous; snout very flat, 

 broad and depressed; palate not at all vaulted, but very flat and 

 smooth; premaxillary bones completely coossified, not perforated by 

 a fenestra; internal nares widely separated, much further apart 

 than external nostrils; lungless. These characters are exhibited 

 in the figures of the skull, Plate XI V, figs. 4, 5, 6 and 10. 

 Leurognathus marmorata sp. nov. 



Diagnosis. — Palatine teeth entirely wanting; thirteen costal 

 grooves between the axilla and the groin; oppressed limbs fail to 

 meet by the width of about two costal interspaces; body stout, 

 depressed; tail finned, its length about five-elevenths of entire 

 length; digits well developed; color buff or ashy, marbled with 

 black. 



Description of male type. — Form rather robust, body depressed, 

 widest in middle, but becoming nearly quadrate at the inserlion of 

 the hind legs, where the width becomes considerably reduced 

 ventrally, while a thick welt overhangs the bases of the thighs 

 dorsally. A distinct median dorsal groove extends from the occi- 

 put to the base of the tail, meeting the successive pairs of costal 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 317 



grooves, which are conspicuously developed and extend without 

 break from median ventral to median dorsal lines. Between the 

 origin of the fore and hind limbs there are thirteen pairs of these, 

 the first being directly over the axilla, the thirteenth inguinal. A 

 fourteenth lies directly over the axis of the femur when the leg is 

 extended at right angles to the body. Anterior to the axilla are 

 two more incomplete grooves close together. Somewhat irregularly 

 developed and ill-defined intermuscular grooves are continued for 

 the greater part of the length of the tail. 



The tail is five-elevenths of the entire length, quadrate at the 

 base, where it is broader dorsally than ventrally. While the 

 height remains nearly constant till near the end, the thickness 

 decreases rapidly, so that the posterior two-thirds are decidedly 

 compressed. The extreme end of the tail is slightly bent up and 

 terminates in a little compressed tubercle. A prominent dorsal fin- 

 fold occupies rather more than its posterior half, reaching its 

 greatest height sixteen millimeters from the tip. Its free margin is 

 irregular and ragged, the result apparently of wear. A low dorsal 

 fold continues the fin-fold forward on to the base of the tail. A 

 much narrower ventral fold, which is highest posteriorly, extends 

 almost half the length of the tail. 



The limbs, especially the hind pair, are well developed. "When 

 appressed to the sides of the body the fore limbs reach to a point 

 about half-way between the fifth and sixth costal grooves (counting 

 from the axillary), and the hind limbs similarly appressed reach 

 cephalad of the eighth costal groove, so that the extremities of the 

 two limbs are separated by two costal spaces. The fore limbs are 

 slightly depressed, the digits are long, slender and entirely free; 

 they increase in length in the following order: i, iv, ii and iii, the 

 number of phalanges being respectively 1, 2, 2 and 3. Each digit 

 is terminated by a slightly enlarged dark-brown horny nail which 

 is particularly conspicuous on digit i. No distinct palmar tubercles 

 are developed, but there is a deep groove extending from between 

 the second and third fingers, meeting a curved depressed line 

 which crosses the palm. 



The pes is large, broad and flat, with a small first digit and the 

 others long, slender, free and somewhat flattened. Digit i is less 

 than one-half the length of v, then ii, iv and iii become succes- 

 sively longer, but iii and iv are nearly equal. The number of 




318 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



phalanges composing the digits from i to v is respectively 1, 2, 3, 3 

 and 2. Like those of the hand, the pedal digits bear dark-colored 

 horny tips. Distinct tubercles are absent, but grooves corre- 

 sponding to those of the manus are present. 



The form of the head is very characteristic, the snout being niore 

 flattened than in any of our smaller salamanders; its middle part 

 has no evident curvature whatever. Outside of a line joining the 

 anterior angle of the eye to the corresponding nostril it slopes 

 gently downward, causing a faintly marked canthus rostralis, but 

 the profile continues straight to a point between the nostrils, ante- 

 rior to which it bends sharply downward into the alveolar margin 

 of the jaw. The outline of the snout is a smooth regular curve 

 with a just suggested angle below the nostrils; anteriorly it projects 

 slightly beyond the lower jaw. The nostrils are small but, being 

 surrounded by a raised fold and connected with the margin of the 

 jaw by a groove, are conspicuous. They are separated by a dis- 

 tance about equal to the cleft of the eye. 



The cleft of the mouth is slightly sinuous, and above its angle is a 

 rounded elevation bounded behind by a well-marked vertical groove 

 and above by a branch of this groove Avhich is directed toward the 

 eye. There is no conspicuously swollen parotid region and the 

 posterior part of the head is smoothly rounded. The low but well- 

 marked gular fold is, in this example, perfectly straight and is almost 

 continuous on the sides of the neck with a faint dorsal groove. 



One of the most striking features of the species, though not 

 diagnostic among its allies, is the prominence of the rather large 

 eyes, which in the living animal are very conspicuous. This results 

 not so much from their size as from the flatness of the snout which 

 forces them to stand out above its surface. Both the anterior and 

 posterior angles present small tubercles, Avhile behind the posterior 

 is a distinct vertical curved fold — a spur from the lower eyelid, 

 which is much broader behind. The upper eyelid about equals the 

 interorbital space in width. 



The vent is a narrow longitudinal slit about as long as the diam- 

 eter of the thigh and situated in the base of the tail. Its margins 

 are smooth and unmodified. The surface of the skin is generally 

 smooth, but on the snout is slightly pitted and papillate. 



Three series of dermal sense organs are present on the trunk, the 

 middle one being best developed and most complete. It begins 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 319 



above the axilla, and may be traced about half-way along the tail. 

 The segmental organs are generally one near the anterior border 

 of each costal fold, though some of the anterior somites present 

 two. The dorsal series is very incomplete and disappears on the 

 tail and middle trunk region. The ventral series of sense organs 

 is complete on the trunk somites, several of the anterior and pos- 

 terior of which are provided with two organs each. On the sides 

 of the head a number of pores are aggregated in a rather large 

 patch behind and below the angle of the mouth. They are arranged 

 more or less into rows and are connected by a transverse line across 

 the occipital region. A line of pores extends forward along the 

 lower jaw and a shorter one on the upper jaw. 



The color pattern is rather characteristic. The ground color is 

 a decidedly yellowish buff, everywhere more or less thickly marked, 

 except on the ventral surface, with irregular confluent blotches of 

 black, sometimes distinct, sometimes obscure. On the parietal, 

 frontal and rostral regions the ground color strongly predominates, 

 while the whole occipital and nuchal regions are heavily blotched. 

 On the base of the dorsum of the tail the color pattern takes the 

 form of large blotches of the ground color in a network of 

 black. Extending on to the sides of the body and tail the two 

 colors become interdiffused, producing a gray color with small light 

 yellow specks. The ventral surface is pale yellow, largely pure, 

 but becoming clouded on the tail, pelvic region and throat. The 

 dorsal and ventral surfaces of the limbs are colored respectively 

 like the corresponding surfaces of the body. The toes are tipped 

 with brown. 



Of all regions the palate has the most characteristic appearance. 

 Inside of the narrow vertical alveolar margins of the jaw which 

 bound it, it presents a broad, perfectly smooth, unbroken and 

 almost flat surface — a low unarched roof to the mouth. There is 

 no shelf or fold of the integument within and parallel to the alveo- 

 lar margin, no median pit and no trace of palatine teeth, the 

 region usually occupied by the latter being perfectly smooth and 

 flat. More remarkable still are the choame. These are minute 

 slits lying between the anterior outer margins of the orbits and the 

 maxillary tooth line, and consequently diverging posteriorly, wheie 

 they are separated by a distance twice that between the external 

 nares. 




320 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



The tongue is broadly reniform, presenting a median longitu- 

 dinal depression and some irregular wrinkles. Its margin is 

 smooth, but the greater part of the upper surface is thickly cov- 

 ered with slender papilla?, forming a plush-like surface. The 

 lateral and posterior margins are free, the anterior attached in the 

 middle. The pedicle of attachment is triangular in section, its 

 broad part corresponding with the anterior margin, and its apex 

 with the posterior emargination. 



The female type specimen is larger and more robust, with a 

 shorter tail and broader, more flattened head. The snout is espe- 

 cially broad and flat, its width on a line with the anterior angles of 

 the eyes being twice its length anterior to that line. The canthal 

 tubercle is almost obsolete. The gular fold is distinctly curved 

 forward. The appressed limbs are separated by slightly more than 

 two costal interspaces. There is but one groove anterior to the 

 axillary. The dorsal series of sense pores is better developed than 

 in the male. The colors are duller and less pure in this example. 

 The ground color above is buff, large blotches of Avhich alternate 

 with still larger blotches of a purplish black on the dorsal surface. 

 These blotches are largest at the base of the tail and pelvic 

 region, but on the head break up and become intermixed. 

 Below, the color is very generally a dull yellowish ash. 



A second female example, used for dissection and for the 

 preparation of a skeleton, was similar to the last, but had two 

 preaxillary grooves, as in the male specimen first described. This 

 species exhibits in its skull many peculiarities which readily distin- 

 guish it from any of the described species of Desmognathus, in 

 which the cranial characters are remarkably uniform. Thorius is 

 clearly separated by the very large size of the nostrils which 

 encroach largely upon the consequently very narrow premaxillary, 

 by the high, narrow and strongly convex snout and by the ossified 

 carpus and tarsus. The skeleton of Typhlotriton has not been 

 described, but in the arched palate and position of the choanse, 

 etc., this genus approaches Desmogncdhus, from which it is chiefly 

 distinguished by the strongly developed curved series of palatine 

 teeth and the deep -sunken functionless eyes. 



In L. marmorata the orbits are large and cause much of the great 

 relative width of the skull, while the interorbital portion of the 

 brain case is comparatively narrow. At their widest part the 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 321 



frontal bones are less than the transverse diameter of the orbit, 

 while in Desmognathus they equal or exceed this measurement. 

 On the other hand, the parasphenoid width is greater in the present 

 species, its interorbital portion being distinctly flattened instead 

 of strongly rounded or even ridged as ill Desmognathus. Conse- 

 quently a section of this region is quadrate in Leurognathus and 

 nearly triangular in Desmognathus. A strongly marked raised line 

 crosses the parasphenoid at the posterior margin of the dentigerous 

 plates and joins the periotic process on each side; this is wanting 

 or inconspicuous in Desmognathus and in any case does not reach 

 the periotic process. 



The snout is perfectly flat between the just evident canthi 

 rostrales, and the profile is straight from the posterior margin of the 

 orbits to the sharply decurved alveolar margin of the jaw, giving 

 this salamander a physiognomy very different from that of the 

 species of Desmognathus, in which there is a strong longitudinal as 

 well as a transverse curvature to this region. The entire roof and 

 floor of* the nasal chamber are closely approximated, resulting in a 

 remarkable shallowness of the passages and a similarity in the 

 form of the palate and snout. The completely coalesced pre- 

 maxillaries are broad throughout, being nowhere less than one and 

 one-half times the diameter of the nares, while the breadth be- 

 tween the latter is more than twice their diameter. At the frontal 

 suture the premaxillary is truncated and overlaps the frontal, not 

 bifurcated to embrace the mesial process of the latter as in Des- 

 mognathus. The premaxillary fontanelle, so conspicuous in 

 Desmognathus and other genera of salamanders, is entirely closed, 

 its position being indicated only by a slight depression. The 

 externa] nares are small and separated by a distance of at least 

 twice their diameter. 



Extensively developed vomero-palatine bones constitute most of 

 the roof of the mouth, and as they join the premaxillary and 

 maxillaries with perfectly flush joints, the palate is given that 

 strikingly smooth, flat and unbroken appearance which suggested 

 the generic name. There is no trace of the deep median groove 

 which separates the two halves of this bone anteriorly in Desmog- 

 nathus and communicates (usually above a narrow bridge of bone) 

 with'the premaxillary fontanelle. These bones are united with the 

 21

premaxillary for the whole width of its palatal surface. The in- 

 ternal nares are inconspicuous narrow slits situated close to the 

 anterior margins of the orbits at the extreme posterior outer angle 

 of the voinero-palatines and extending into the palatal plates of 

 the maxillaries. The actual choanal correspond to the outer ends of 

 these clefts and are consequently very widely separated, a condition 

 very different from that found in Desmognathus, in which the clefts 

 cut deep into the vomero-palatines and expand at their inner ends 

 into conspicuous openings, which are the choanal. 



The parasphenoid teeth are borne on a pair of long, slender and 

 pointed dentigerous plates, which are placed together as a sagittate 

 area, posterior to the middle of the orbit. Each plate bears about 

 eighteen or twenty oblique rows of minute teeth, each row con- 

 taining from five to twelve teeth. There are about one 

 hundred and twenty jaw teeth above and an equal number 

 below, about fifteen being borne by the premaxillary. All of 

 these teeth are set on the inner face of the alveolar flange and have 

 simple, blunt, slightly compressed and undivided crowns. In the 

 posterior part of both jaws they become smaller and more crowded. 

 In the specimen dissected the posterior cranial region, the ptery- 

 goids and the branchio-hyal apparatus are essentially as in Desmog- 

 nathus. There are sixteen presacral, one sacral and twenty-four 

 postsacral vertebra?. 



The visceral anatomy resembles in its general features the three 

 species of Desmognathus which I have studied. There is no trace 

 •of lungs, and it may be added that lungs are entirely absent in 

 DesmognaJthus nigra and D. orchrophcea, 1 in which this deficiency 

 has not previously been noted. 



The three examples of this species above described, being all 

 that have been taken, were found in a large clear rocky pool be- 

 neath a waterfall of a stream on the south flank of Grandfather 

 Mt., X. C. , and at an elevation of about 3,500 feet. From what 

 observations were made they seem to be essentially aquatic, remain- 

 ing in the deeper parts of the pool and not burrowing beneath 

 stones in places merely wet, as does the D. nigra, which occurs in 

 great numbers in the same region. L. marmorata is much less 



1 The examples of this species -which Wilder originally described as lung- 

 less have more recently been identified as belonging to the species Spelerpes 

 bilineatus.

active than the latter species and swims rather sluggishly, but with 

 an easy gliding motion. The individuals seen seemed rather shy, 

 and when alarmed quickly took refuge under the large rocks scat- 

 tered through the pool, from beneath which, however, they were 

 easily induced to emerge by the attraction of pieces of meat or 

 worms thrown into the water.

THE MARINE FISHES OF PERU. 

 BY JAMES FRANCIS ABBOTT. 



The study of the ichthyology of the west coast of South Amer- 

 ica, which was beguu by Valenciennes in the early volumes of the 

 Histoire Naturelle, has been carried on since in a very desultory way. 

 The only general works that have appeared have been the fairly 

 extensive Fauna Chllena of Claude Gay, published in 1848, and 

 the, ichthyologically, very incomplete Fauna Peruana of Tschudi, 

 published in 1845. The former contains descriptions of 108 

 species of fishes, the latter of but nineteen. Whatever work has 

 been done since has consisted merely of isolated descriptions of 

 single species or of small collections that have occasionally fallen 

 into investigators' hands. Tschudi himself made extensive collec- 

 tions in Peru, but through a series of misfortunes they were nearly 

 all lost. A few years before, the results of the voyage of " The 

 Beagle ' ' had been published, and the fishes collected by Darwin, 

 quite a number of which had been taken from the west coast of 

 South America, were described by Dr. Leonard Jenyns. 



But by far the greater number of the species known from this 

 region have been described by Kuer and by Steindachner. The 

 Ickthyologische Notizen, which were published by the latter at 

 intervals from 1864 to 1870, and the Ichthijologische Beitrage, 

 which followed from 1874 to 1882, contain numerous descriptions 

 of species from Peru and Chile. In 1867-68 Kner published the 

 results of his Avork upon the fishes in the Godeffroy Museum at 

 Hamburg, which contained many South American examples col- 

 lected by the captains of Hamburg merchant vessels. More 

 recently Steindachner has described the collection of fishes obtained 

 by Dr. L. Plate in his extensive exploration of Chile. 1 Many 

 of these are from Iquique, and are here included, while others 

 heretofore known only from Peru or northward are recorded from 

 Chilean waters for the first time.

And yet it is fair to state that the total number of valid species 

 known to-day from Cape Horn to the equator does not exceed 300, 

 and of these only 100, more or less, are found between the equator 

 and the Tropic of Capricorn. In contrast to this we recognize 

 over 300 species along the west coast of Mexico and Central 

 America alone, from Panama to the Tropic of Cancer. 



It is certain that the southern region is fully as rich as the 

 northern, and the field — at least of Peru — remains practically 

 unexplored. Very nearly all the material that has been collected 

 has been obtained from one source — the fish-markets. The tide- 

 pools are untouched, the deep-sea fishes almost unknown, and a 

 multitude of forms, of little importance economically but of great 

 interest scientifically, await the word of the investigator to introduce 

 them to the world. 



The basis of the present paper has been a collection of marine 

 fishes made in Callao by Rear- Admiral L. A. Beardslee, U. 8. N., 

 retired, on a cruise of U. S. S. " Philadelphia," during the 

 month of January, 1896. Though rather small, the collection 

 contains a great deal of interesting material. 



The scattered condition of the literature has hindered a study of 

 the subject, and one of the principal purposes of the present brief 

 paper has been to collect and modernize the synonymy of the species 

 inhabiting this region. 



\Ve have included all the marine species known to us, inhabiting 

 a range from Pecasmayu bay on the north to Iquique on the 

 south, and limited in a general way by the political boundaries of 

 Peru. The detailed synonymy has been given for all references to 

 the west coast of South America, and the author responsible for 

 the present generic and specific name of each form has been cited, 

 but otherwise only enough synonymy has been included to guide 

 the reader to other sources. The page references to Cope and 

 Steindachner are those of the reprints containing their descrip- 

 tions. 



The habitats given to many species by early workers were very 

 general, aud many ranges that we have copied from their descrip- 

 tions will doubtless have to be restricted. A few species have been 

 described from ' ' the west coast of South America, ' ' and have been 

 admitted provisionally into the present list until future investiga- 

 tion shall have established their true position. 




326 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



One hundred and two species, belonging to forty-two families, 

 are here recognized as valid. Of these, fifty are confined to the 

 Peruvian regiou, twenty-seven are common to both Peru and Chile, 

 and thirteen are recorded north of the equator. 



The following are here described as new: 



Basiliehthys octavius. 



Basilichthys regillus. 



Basiliehthys jordani. 



Piseiregia beardsleel, new gen. aud sp. 



Sciaena gilberti. 



The writer wishes to express his indebtedness to Admiral 

 Beardslee, through whose efforts the Callao collection was made, and 

 the present paper made possible. He is also indebted to Mr. 

 James Douglas Ogilby, of Sydney, N. S. W., who has contributed 

 important information and suggestions, as well as to Dr. G. A. 

 Boulenger, of the British Museum, who has very kindly exam- 

 ined types and in other ways rendered valuable assistance. Espe- 

 cially must he express his obligatious to Dr. Charles H. Gilbert, 

 of Leland Stanford, Jr. University, in whose laboratory the work 

 was carried on, and to President David Starr Jordan, who has 

 taken a personal interest in the work and who personally super- 

 vised it.

The five specimens in the collection show a most remarkable 

 color variation. Two of them have the typical silvery plumbeous 

 ground color, paler ventrally and slightly flecked with light spots 

 along the sides. The other three are transversely barred with about 

 sixteen rather broad black bands, extending across the back half- 

 way down on each side. There are five or six in front of the first 

 dorsal, the two anterior ones bounding the interorbital space. 

 These are not sex markings, as both sexes occur in each variety. 

 The most careful comparison and elaborate and accurate measure- 

 ments fail to reveal any other difference. The anal arises under 

 tho posterior third of the dorsal, barely extending beyond that fin.

 somewhat more anteriorly (.29 to end of snout) and the outline of 

 the humeral process is orbicular instead of being irregular, as in

vii, (good). 



Local name. Machete. 



This species is very closely related to Potamalosa (Clupea) nota- 

 canthw (Gunther), 1 from Valparaiso, with which it may be identical. 

 The type locality of Steindaehner's species was given erroneous; y 

 as Mazatlan, but the specimen doubtless came from further down 

 the coast. The principal differences that separate the two species 

 lie in the scales, which are striate and fimbriate in notacanthoides, 

 and in the veinuies of the opercle which are very prominent in 

 that species. Dr. Boulenger very kindly examined the types of 

 Clupea notacanthus for us. He says: " The scales, about 48 in 

 lat. line, show no trace of striations and the opercle is not 

 veined. The dorsal scutes number 23 and 27 respectively. No 

 traces of dark spots." It is worthy of note, however, that Gtin- 

 ther's types are all small, 4 inches, and it may be that the differ- 

 ence in size and age is accountable for the differences noted above. 

 We have examined specimens of P. notacartthoides from Valpa- 

 raiso, and find that they agree with those from Callao in every 

 particular. 



The diagnosis of the genus Potamalosa, 3 which was created to 

 receive the species P. antique Ogilby (Clupea novcehollandioz Giin- 

 ther, not Meletta novozhollandixB Valenciennes) will have to be 

 somewhat modified to admit P. notacanthoides. The constant 

 characters that appear to be of generic value are the position of 

 the dorsal, which originates well in advance of the middle of the 

 body, the number of branchiostegals and the rays of the anal. 4

4 The following synopsis will show the differences between the two species 

 of the genus : 



Gen. Potamalosa Ogilby. Origin of dorsal well in advance of middle of 

 body ; branchiostegals 8 or 9 ; anal rays 18 or less, —

 highly developed ; opercle veined notacanthoides. 



(b) Dorsal scutes prominent ; scales entire : muciferous system confined 

 to main arteries ; opercle quite smooih antiqua.

variation in the number of ventral scutes, which run from 19 to 

 21 before the ventrals and from 16 to 18 behind them. Dorsal 

 scutes 24 — 27 in one specimen (misprinted 7 in Steindachner's 

 description). Opercular veinules prominent. Color, above dark 

 greenish brown, below silvery yellow. Dorsal dark, caudal with 

 broad dark margin; other fins pale, six or eight round or elongate 

 dark blotches along the side in the silvery portion. A like num- 

 ber more or less parallel with them in the darker upper half of 

 body, just above the color line.

Clupea maculata' Gunther, Cat. Brit. Mus., vii, 443, [CallaoJ ; Stein-

This s|)ecies is very close to Potamalosa notacanthoides and possi- 

 bly belongs to that genus, though no dorsal serrature has been 

 described. But the type specimens in the British Museum are in 

 j?uch poor condition that one is not warranted in saying that a 

 dorsal serrature is absent in the adult, 5 aud in the description of 

 Steindachner's single specimen no mention is made of the matter.

Local name, Anchobeta. 



The single specimen of this species is a typical Engraulis, and 

 when compared with the California specimens of E mordax estab- 

 lishes without doubt the individuality of the two species. 



They differ most markedly in coloring and in the shape of the 

 head. The specimens of E. mordax examined are truly spindle- 

 shaped, the dorsal and ventral outlines curving symmetrically from 

 snout to tail; in E. ringens the dorsal outline is nearly straight, 

 the greatest body depth is at the pectorals and the ventral outline 

 slopes without much curve to the caudal peduncle which is slightly 

 thicker in ringens (34; in head to 3f in mordax). In the former 

 species the head is deeper in proportion to. its length, being If in its 

 length at the occiput to \'^-\lr in E. mordax. The maxillary is 

 contained 5J times in the length in ringens, 4^ in mordax. In the 

 fonner species the mandible reaches nearer to the end of the snout 

 than in the latter, ending about half way between nostril and tip of 

 snout. In E. mordax it does not quite reach nostril, thus falsely 

 giving E. ringens the appearance of having a shorter snout. The 

 distance from the end of the mandible to the tip of the snout is 

 contained If in the eye in ringens, to li in mordax. 



In ringens the gill cleft is much longer, beginning almost level 

 with the back and the opercle is correspondingly produced, rounding 

 out in a full curve instead of descending abruptly to the posterior 

 angle as in mordax. The distance between the limit of the inter- 

 opercle and the outer edge of the opercle at the upper angle of 

 gill cover is contained in the head 5^ times in E. ringens, 7 times 

 in E. mordax. 



In ringens the pectorals reach two-thirds of the way to the ven- 

 trals, in mordax they extend almost to the ventrals. In the former 

 specit s the anal is somewhat more posterior, the distance from the 

 end of the anal to the beginning of the caudal being contained 

 twice in the head, to 2^- times in mordax. The anal is somewhat 

 shorter in the former, its base being contained 6 times in the length 

 to 5 \ in mordax. 



The dorsal is also shorter, its base being contained 2f times in 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 337 



the head in the former to twice in the latter. In the former the 

 ventrals arc 3 in the head, in the latter 2^. 



The specimen in hand is dark olive green above the silvery stripe. 

 This is narrower than in specimens of E. mordax examined, 

 beginning about midway of the body, while in mordax the silvery 

 part covers about three-quarters of the side.

ATHERINID^l. 



The large Atherinoids of the west coast of South America form 

 in number a very considerable proportion of the fish fauna of that 

 region. They are of the very finest of food fishes and with Mugil 

 cephalus comprise the bulk of the market fish in Callao and Lima 

 during the months of December and January, great quantities 

 being consumed daily. 



Until recently, nearly all fishes of the Basilichthys group have 

 been referred to the two species, Basilichthys (Atherinichthys) 

 laticlavia Cuv. and Val. and B. micro lepidotus Jenyns, both origi- 

 nally from Chile. But it is evident that there must exist a great 

 variety of forms throughout the whole region. Gay, indeed, 

 hazarded the suggestion (Fauna Chilena, p. 255) that there 

 " must be many other species [than the above two] in the seas, 

 lakes and rivers of Chile." Two of these have recently been 

 described by Steindachner 6 as Chirostoma (Basilichthys) affine and 

 C. gracile, both very closely related to the forms here described. 



B. microlepidotus has been very well figured and described by 

 Jenyns, 7 Girard 8 and Kner. 9 It is characterized especially by the 

 small, low, few-spined, first dorsal set rather close to the second dorsal. 

 B. laticlavia has been less fortunate. The origiual description 10 

 is too brief to ofier any decisive characters separating it from the 

 closely related species and its status was not improved by the 

 altered description of the species Avhich Giinther gives in hia

Catalogue (Vol. Hi, 402). It is likely that either the specimens 

 described by Giinther did not belong to laiiclavia, or else that more 

 than one species was included under that name. However, from 

 Valenciennes' descriptions it is evident that laiiclavia has the head 

 shorter in proportion to the length than in any other related species 

 of which we know, except affine, and the first dorsal is relatively 

 more posterior than in any species we have examined. 



Basilichthys brevianalis (Giinther) 11 from Valparaiso has larger 

 scales than any of the Peruvian species (67 in lateral line; and 

 B. alburnus (Giinther) 1 -' from the Strait of Magellan, much 

 smaller scales (105 in lateral line). 



Humboldt observed a Piexe-rey at Callao to which he gave the 

 name regia, and which is described by Cuvier and Valenciennes, 13 

 but so briefly that it is almost impossible to refer any specimen 

 definitely to that species. The genus Basilichthys, as here under- 

 stood, includes those Atherinoids with premaxillaries protractile and 

 broadened posteriorly, scales small (70-100 in lateral line), and 

 with the upper jaw developed fully as strongly as the lower.

 35. Basilichthys jordani Abbott. New species. 



In the presence of vomerine teeth and in the development of the 

 lower jaw, this species approaches Ghirostoma. But in its appear- 

 ance and the smallness of its scales it is a typical Basilichthys. 



The striking difference in appearance between fishes of the genera 

 Basilichthys and Ghirostoma seem- to lie not so much in the 

 strengthening of the mandible in the latter, as in the more notice- 

 able weakening of the upper jaw, so that the lower jaw projects 

 and forces the mouth into a strongly diagonal slant. In Basilich- 

 thys the upper jaw is as strong as the lower and slightly projecting, 

 and the mouth is almost horizontal.

 of the eye. its first spine vertically above tip of ventral. Inter- 

 dorsal space oh in body length. Second dorsal inserted above 

 eighth anal ray. Color as in other related species. Medio-dorsal 

 lines present but obscure. Stripe covering h + 2 + \ scale rows 

 at middle of body.

It gives me great pleasure to name this species for President 

 David Starr Jordan, of Leland Stanford, Jr. University, to whose 

 friendlv interest and wealth of experience and knowledge the 

 younger students of ichthyology in this country owe so much.

Ghirostoma afflm Steindachner, Fauna Chilensis, 313, 1898 [Iquique]. 

 This species apparently closely resembles the preceding. It 

 appears to differ from B. jordani in the absence of vomerine teeth, 

 and from jordani, regillw and octavius in the much shorter head 

 and in the position of the first dorsal. Steindachner also describes 

 ( 1. c. 314) a species of the same genus, gracile, from Juan Fernandez 

 which is distinct from those mentioned above, though closely related. 



PISCIREGIA Abbott. New genus. 



Body and head pike dike. Premaxillary not protractile, its skin 

 continuous with that of the forehead. First dorsal small, with few 

 spines, situated posteriorly. Teeth rather strong, the outer series 

 in^each jaw enlarged. Vomer with teeth. Mouth margined 

 entirely by premaxillary, the maxillary lying behind. Caudal 

 peduncle thick. The genus is related to Atherinops and Ather- 

 inopsis by the non-protracl ile premaxillary, differing from the 

 former in having simple teeth and from the latter in the presence of 

 vomerine teeth, in the enlargement of the outer series of the max- 

 illary and in the small size of the first dorsal.

After making careful comparisons between six specimens of this 

 species from Callao and others from Italy, Texas, Florida and

 given by Jordan and Evermann (Fishes of N. A., i, 811) that all 

 belong to one and the same species.

The large specimens appear to be typical, though the color mark- 

 ings are somewhat obscure. \Ve are inclined to recognize the speci- 

 fic identity of 8. orientalist as distinct from 8. chilensis, notwith- 

 standing the fact that Jordan and Evermann, following Dresslar 

 and Fesler (Bull. U. S. F. C, vii, 1887, 441) place both in the 

 synonymy of Sarda chilensis. 



Iu the specimens in hand the eye is 8 in head as against 9^ in 

 orientalis (same length fish), and the posterior end of the maxil- 

 lary, instead of being irregular in outline and concave on its upper 

 border as in S. orientalis and S. sarda, is regular and almost round. 

 The single juvenile specimen shows the same peculiarities iu color 

 markings as have been noted in the young of S. sarda, by Stein- 

 dachner (Ichthy. Beriehte, v, 8, 1868). There are no traces of 

 longitudinal striping, but the sides are barred two-thirds of the 

 way from pectoral to tail with ten or eleven dusky vertical stripes. 

 The posterior end of the maxillary is also weakly, but evidently 

 serrate. 



The discrepancies in color markings to be noticed in the pub- 

 lished figures of both S. sarda and S. chilensis are doubtless due to 

 the fact that the specimens drawn have been in all stages of transi- 

 tion between the juvenile barred type and the adult form with nar- 

 row longitudinal stripes.

The collection contains four specimens of this species. There is 

 evidently some variation in coloration between representatives from 

 different localities, though there is no reason for confounding hume- 

 ralis with the very distinct though closely allied form P. albomacu- 

 latus from the Galapagos Island. 16 



Compared with specimens from the type locality, aside from the 

 very striking and constant difference in color markings, albomacu- 

 latus differs from the present species in having a considerably nar- 

 rower interorbital width, narrower pectoral, smaller eye, and lunate 

 (sometimes almost truncate) instead of forked caudal. 



The specimens described by Kner (I. c. ) from Peru, as Servian* 

 humeralis (var. ?) doubtless belong to an unnamed species.

 This species, the type of the genus Isacia, is separated from 

 Bieeker's genus Parapridipoma by the long anal and absence of

its scaly sheath. The value of the first character is question able, 

 as the species of Parapristipoma show a regular gradation in num- 

 ber of anal rays up to the number in the present species, and the 

 character of the scaly sheath is apt to be misunderstood, as there is 

 present in I. conceptionis (at least in the specimens at hand) a 

 slight development of scales at the base of the anal, two or three 

 scale-rows deep and at its widest part about one-ninth the length 

 of the longest ray. On the other hand, the sheath in Parapris- 

 tipoma trilineatum, the type of that genus, is, according to Bleeker's 

 figure, 17 about two-fifths of the length of the first ray, and com- 

 posed of 7 or 8 scale rows at the widest part. The preopercular 

 spines of I, conceptionis are weak and partly hidden by the skin 

 and there appears to be no special development of them at the 

 angle. The spines of Parapristipoma are rather strong, especially 

 at the angle.

 62. Archoscion analis (Jenyns). 



Otolithu* analis JeDyns, Zool. Beagle Fishes, 164, 1*4:2 [Callao]. 



Local name, Allanque. 



It is the conviction of the writer that no hard and fast lines can 

 be drawn between the genera Archoscion, Isopidhus and Cynoscion 

 and that their species should come under one generic head, for 

 which the name Cynoscion has priority. But in the absence of 

 material for a comparative study of the groups, we are forced to 

 follow precedent in placing this and the two following species under 

 Archoscion. 



Three examples, length 330 mm. to 350 mm. Head 3f, depth 

 4% ; D. ix-i,24 (23); A. i,15 (14). Eye 6J; interorbital broad, 

 4 in head; snout 3f. 



Body elongate, compressed, back but little elevated. Snout 

 long, lower jaw projecting. Head long, profile straightish, very 

 slightly convex above eyes. Maxillary extending to posterior 

 border of pupil, 2^ in head, its broad distal end about one-half the 

 length of the snout in width. Preorbital narrow, 2f in eye. 

 Upper anterior canines stout, conical, slightly incurved. The 5 to 

 7 lateral teeth of the lower jaw enlarged, scattered, about one-third 

 the length of the upper canines. Anterior teeth of lower jaw in 

 two rows, rather small and crowded. Preopercle with a crenulate 

 membranaceous border. Soft flap of opercle extending to or past 

 origin of pectoral. Opercular spines absent. Gill rakers long, 

 slender, 7 + 9. 



First dorsal spine very weak, third the longest, 2\ in head. In- 

 terdorsal space ecmal to eye. Origin of second dorsal nearer to 

 caudal than to snout. Pectoral narrow, If in head. Ventrals 

 shorter, about 2 in head. Caudal shallowly lunate. 



Scales moderate, 63 pores in lateral line, about 75 transverse 

 rows from opercle to caudal. Lateral hues somewhat decurved 

 under origin of soft dorsal. Head everywhere scaled, except on 

 premaxillarv. 



Color, dark umber above, lighter on sides, yellowish white 

 below. Sides below lateral line with a great number of small

orange spots arranged longitudinally. Posterior margins of scales 

 peppered with dark dots. Upper half of pectoral dark. Ventrals 

 pale. Axil dark. 

 Habitat. — Peru. 



63. Archoscion altipinnis (Steindachner). 



Aneylodon altipinnis Steindachner, Ichthy. Notizen, iii, 2, plate 1, 

 fig. 2, 1866 [" West Coast of South America"]. 



Archoscion analis Jordan and Eigenmann, Eep. U. S. F. C. , '86, 353, 

 1889 [Callao]. 



Although there are no specimens of this species in the Beardslee 

 collection, yet a careful comparison of Steindachner' s description 

 and plate, with examples of C. analis, indicate conclusively that it 

 is distinct from Jenyn's species. In analis the interdorsal space is 

 large, a* long as eye, and the two dorsals are not connected. In 

 altipinnis the two fins are connected by a low membrane and are 

 presumably close together (distance equal to pupil, Jor. and Eig. ). 



The eye is somewhat smaller in analis, being 6 in head to 5 in 

 altipinnis; the snout is longer, 3-| in head to 4^ in altipinnis, and 

 the depth in the former rather less, 4| in body, while Steindachner 

 gives 4^. The most important difference seems to lie in the lack of 

 developed opercular spines in analis, while the other species has two 

 quite strong spines. 



Habitat. — Peru, perhaps extending southward. 



64. Archoscion peruanus (Tschudi). 



Otolithus peruanus Tschudi, Fauna Peruana, Ichthy., 10, 1845. 



This species, which is very closely related to C. analis, is known 

 only from the original description. It appears to differ from analis 

 in having the second dorsal equidistant from snout and caudal and 

 hardly separated from the first dorsal, while in analis the two fins 

 are widely separated and the second is considerably nearer caudal 

 than snout. The ventrals are longer in peruanxis, reaching past 

 pectorals, while in the former species the pectorals are considerably 

 longer. 



Following is Tschudi' s original description :

68. Sciaena gilberti Abbott. New species. 



Iii the Review of the Sciaenidre, Rep. U. S. F. C, 1889, p. 59, 

 Jordan and Eigenmann place the Peruvian species S. deliciosa by 

 itself under a subgenus Callaus. The present species is very closely 

 related to deliciosa, and comes under the same subgeneric head. In 

 contrast 1o other related genera and species, 8. gilberti and S. 

 deliciosa agree in having short and moderate second anal spine, 

 moderately long and numerous gill rakers, and weak preopercular 

 armature. They appear to be most nearly allied to the putative 

 genus Bola of Hamilton, differing in not having the upper teeth 

 greatly enlarged. Eegarding the two forms as species of the genus 

 Sckena, they stand as a connecting link between those genera with 

 long and slender gill rakers and those with gill rakers short and 

 thick, in that respect approximating Bairdiella on the one hand, 

 and Scicenops on the other. S. gilberti differs from the other 

 Peruvian species .S'. wieneri in lacking a strongly toothed pre- 

 opercle and in having a shorter maxillary, larger head and much 

 larger eye. 



Description.— Head 3£, depth U. D. IX-I, 22 (3). A. II, 

 9. Eye 5, interorbital 3f, preorbital 9 in head, 14 in eye, max- 

 illary 2i. Lateral line (pores) 55. 



Body elongate, elliptical, back not very elevated, profile almost 

 straight, rather low. Snout sharp, 3§ in head. Mouth some- 

 what oblique, the maxillary extending beyond pupil. Second nasal 

 slit rather short, 3J in eye. Preopercular seme weak, flexible, 

 flattened, yet still of a bony nature. Xo spinous development at 

 lower angle. Lower jaw scaled. Teeth small, in two or three 

 rows, outer row very slightly enlarged in lower jaw, somewhat more 

 so in upper jaw. Mucous slits present but not especially promi- 

 nent. Gill rakers 8 + 15, ecmal to, or slightly exceeding the 

 pupil, about 3^ in the second anal spine. 



Lateral line following the curve of the back, dipping somewhat 

 under soft dorsal, sometimes sending up a branch at right angles, 

 at base of caudal, which may be continued along the upper mar- 




356 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



gin of the fin. Ventrals almost twice in head reaching about half- 

 way to the vent. Pectorals moderate, about li in head. 



Second anal spine about one-half length of longest ray, 2-| in 

 head. Caudal subtruncate, the outer rays somewhat the longer. 



Scales above lateral line very oblique, those below in longitu- 

 dinal series, each scale with a central streak forming narroAV par- 

 allel stripes. Ground color olivaceous above, darker on head. 

 Silvery below, tinged with rufous. Axil of pectoi*al dark. Lips 

 thickly speckled with small brown spots. 



Type, No. 11,918, Leland Stanford, Jr. Univ. Mus., length 

 2-40 mm. 



This with S. deliciosa is a very important food fish on the Peru- 

 vian coast. It gives me much pleasure to name the species for my 

 friend and instructor, Dr. Charles H. Gilbert, to whom my inter- 

 est in ichthyology is wholly due.

 preorbital, 6£. D. X-I, 22. A. II, 9. Scales 55. Length 325 

 mm. 



Compared with 8. gilberti, deliciosa has a much broader interor- 

 bital, longer and blunter snout, and hence not quite so steep a 

 profile, longer pectoral and shorter gill rakers. In gilberti the nos- 

 trils are nearer eye than end of snout; in deliciosa they are midway.

MORPHOLOGICAL AND SYSTEMATIC NOTES ON SOUTH AMERICAN 

 LAND SNAILS: ACHATINIDJS. 



BY HENRY A. PILSBRY AND EDWARD G. VANATTA. 



Dr. H. von Ihering, director of the Museu Paulista, having 

 entrusted to the senior author of this paper a considerable collec- 

 tion of alcoholic preparations of land snails amassed during his 

 residence in Brazil, a beginning of their study is herein made. 



It must be regretted by all that von Ihering, urged by the 

 pressure of official duties, could not himself conduct the investi- 

 gation of this important material; for his large experience with 

 South American forms of life and his genius for dealing with 

 problems of molluscan morphology, would have given an especial 

 value to the work. 



Alcoholic specimens of two genera of Achatinidce are present. 

 Neither of them has hitherto been investigated. 



Genus NEOBELISCUS Pilsbry. 

 Nautilus, x, p. 46 (August, 1896). 



Shell solid and strong, large, imperforate, turreted, slowly taper- 

 ing, several earlier whorls rapidly tapering, forming a conic apex. 

 Whorls about 10, similarly sculptured, convex. Aperture irregu- 

 larly ovate, the outer lip unexpanded, acute, columella vertical, 

 foldless, its edge narrowly revolute and adnate throughout. 



Foot very short and broad, squarely truncated behind; with no 

 appearance of grooves or specialized granulation above the mar- 

 gins; sole undivided. 



Genitalia (PI. XV, fig. 5) without accessory organs, the 

 atrium short. tf system with a long, club-shaped penis with 

 strongly folded internal walls, and terminal retractor muscle and 

 vas deferens. Talon (fig. 5a, t.) large, consisting of a swollen distal 

 portion on a narrow, devious duct of similar length. 9 system 

 with the vagina rather short, spermatheca oblong, borne on a duct 

 of about double its own length, and remote from the heart. Free 

 oviduct as long as the spermatheca duct. Uterus with thin walls, 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 367 



enormously distended when containing young, two of which occupy 

 it at a time. 



Albumen gland (figs. 5, da, a. gl.) very small, shorter than the 

 talon and far smaller than the spermatheca. Median moiety of 

 the hermaphrodite duct extravagantly convoluted and knotted. 



Viviparous; the shell of the young at birth is nearly one-fourth 

 the length, and exceeds one-third the diameter of adult shells, 

 with half the number of whorls. 



Ketractor muscle system (PI. XVI, fig. 9) somewhat resem- 

 bling that of Rumina ; right, left and tail reti-actors free except at 

 the very insertion, where they are very shortly united. Tail 

 retractor very long; right retractor splitting up distal! y into (1) 

 numerous anterior and lateral pedal retractors, (2) the retractor 

 of the eye, and (3) the retractor of the penis; left retractor giving 

 rise (1) far anteriorly to the short pharyngeal retractor which is 

 shortly bifurcate anteriorly, and (2) in front of this, splitting into 

 ocular and pedal retractors. 



Lung (PI. XVI, fig. 14) long and narrow, the venation faint, 

 mainly concentrated anteriorly and consisting chiefly of fine parallel 

 veins transverse to the pulmonary vein, which is otherwise un- 

 branched. Heart normal. Kidney more than double the length 

 of the pericardium, quite narrow, its length contained about 3J 

 times in that of the lung. Ureter retrograde, continued along the 

 gut, closed throughout. 



The jaw (PI. XV, fig. 4) is arcuate, densely striated, under 

 strong magnification showing transverse striolation in its substance, 

 crenulating the vertical strise. 



Radula composed of 44, 1, 44 teeth in slightly bow-shaped rows 

 (PI. XV, fig. 1). Centrals very narrow, less than one-fourth 

 ihe width of the adjacent laterals, and bearing no cusps in adult 

 animals. Laterals with the basal plate wide and square, tricuspid, 

 the median cusp broadly conic, not as long as the basal plate, side 

 cusps short and blunt. Marginal teeth' with longer and blunt 

 cutting points on the median, and more acute cutting points on 

 the side cusps. 



Salivary glands united above. Crop moderately swollen, 

 stomach small, globose. 



Type X. [Helix] calcarea Born. Distribution, Brazil and 

 upper Amazon drainage.

Affinities of NeobelisGus. 



Neobeliscus is a genus full of novel and interesting structures ; 

 and while future knowledge of those genera of Stenogyroid Acha- 

 tinidce of which the soft anatomy is yet unknown will doubtless 

 reduce the number of characteristics peculiar to the genus, it will 

 probably still remain somewhat isolated. The clumsy summit of 

 the shell, very different from the small bulbous nucleus of Stenogyra 

 obeliscus, Rumiaa deeollala and other large forms, is one of the 

 obvious conchological stigmata. 



The dull silken lustre of the shell of the enormous uterine 

 young, produced by dense fine lamellose stride, and uncut by the 

 spirals which appear on the post-natal growth, is not paralleled in 

 Stenogyra, which is glossy at first. But it is in the reproductive 

 organs that the most striking features are seen. 



The penis is simple in structure, wanting the peculiar external 

 sheath so characteristic of Achatina ; but its retractor muscle arises 

 not from the diaphragm as in almost all Vasopulmonata, but fro m 

 the right tentacular and pedal band. It would not seem reasonable 

 to question the homology of this penial retractor with the usual 

 one, but how so radical a change of base could have been effected 

 is problematic. We know of no other snail in which the tentacu- 

 lar retractor contributes a fascia to the genital system. The talon 

 (shown partially straightened out in fig. 5a, t. ) is lai'ge as in 

 Callionepion, but of a different shape. The attached portion of the 

 sperm duct is composed of a dense mass of radiating vermiform 

 tubules or cseca, a detail not drawn in the figure. The uterus in 

 virgin or functionally inactive individuals is shrunken, and lies in 

 numerous deep, regular longitudinal plaits. When carrying 

 young at almost full term it presents the appearance shown in fig. 

 5, the young lying with the head directed anteriorly, the ventral 

 face toward the sperm duct. The head of the uterine young is re- 

 tracted ; and from the upper surface of the foot, about the position 

 of the operculum in an operculate snail, there arises a flat membrane 

 which spreads over the ventral face of the young shell (PI. XV, fig. 

 t>, ap.). From the hollow base of this placenta-like organ a duct 

 penetrates forward and upward through the tissues of the foot ; but 

 from the poor preservation of the infant tissues in our material we 

 could not ascertain what it communicates with. From what was 




1899] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 369 



observed it appears likely that the spreading membrane and its 

 duct are analogous to the mammalian placenta and umbilical cord. 

 This probability is enhanced by the reduction of th< albumen gland 

 to a men rudiment or vestige, evidently of but slight functional 

 importance, and probably throwing the function of supplying nu- 

 triment to the embryo upon the arteries of the uterus. 



In the viviparous Stylodonta something of the same sort occurs, 1 

 though I do not know that the albumen gland is obsolete in that 

 genus. 



The jaw and teeth are quite what we would expect, though the 

 absence of a cusp on the narrow central is a further specialization 

 in line with the general degeneration of that tooth in Achatinidce. 

 In the radula of a uterine embryo, however, that cusp was found 

 developed (PI. XV, fig. 2), and all of the cusps, as would be 

 expected of teeth which had never been used, are longer and more 

 acute. 



The myology offers some interesting characters. As in Rumina 

 (figured for comparison in PI. XV, fig. 10), the retractor of the 

 pharynx (ph. r. ) is short and branches from the left retractor band 

 far forward. Unlike Rumina, it bifurcates. "We regard the 

 branch br. of the left retractor band as probably a mere anomaly. 

 It is one of the lateral pedal retractors. All three retractor bands 

 are free to the proximal root, where they are very shortly though 

 firmly united. This is unlike Rumina, in which the right retrac- 

 tor and the tail retractor are united for a distance nearly as great 

 as the free length of the latter. The anomalous insertion of the 

 retractor of the penis has already been discussed. 



The lung resembles that of Rumina (figured in PI. XVI, fig. 

 15 for comparison) in the absence of large branches on the pul- 

 monary vein, and the mainly transverse venation, which in Xeobe- 

 Hseus, however, is much finer and fainter. 



History of the Generic Name. 



In regard to the name herein used for the genus, some explana- 

 tion may be advisable. In a former paper, 2 the senior author pro- 

 posed the name Neobeli*cm for the species calcareus Born and ouneus 



x See Viguer's paper, or the svnopsis given in Man. Conch. (2). ix. p. 

 150. 

 * Nautilus, x, 4(i C1896).

Pfr. Hitherto they have been grouped together with another 

 series of large species, of which Helix obeliscus Moric. is a typical 

 example, under the name Obeliscus Beck; 3 but Gray, in 1847, 

 nominated as the type of that group the Helix obtusata of Gmelin, 

 a species of Madagascar for which the name Clavator was subse- 

 quently proposed. Obeliseus lias also been used by Humphrey 4 in 

 1797 as a genei'ic name for the Trochus dolabratus of Linne, which 

 was later called Pyramidella by Lamarck. Clearly, then, we 

 caunot retain the name for these South American snails. 



In 1854, Shuttleworth'' proposed the genus Stenogyra to include 

 as subgenera the prior groups Rumina Risso (1826), Obeliscus and 

 Subulina Beck (1837), Opens Albers (1850), and the new sub- 

 genus Pseudobalea. 



These sections, as Shuttleworth terms them, are briefly defined, 

 but no types are mentioned ; after which the species of the island 

 of Porto Rico are enumerated: Stenogyra (Opeas) subula Pfr., 

 Stenogyra (Opeas) octonoides C. B. Ad., Stenogyra (Opeas) mar- 

 garitacea Shuttl., Stenogyra (Opeas) alabastrina Shuttl., Stenogyra 

 (Opeas) gomphor'nmi Shuttl., Stenogyra (Opeas) Goodalli Mill., 

 Stenogyra (Pseudobalea) Dominicensis Pfr., Stenogyra (Obeliscus) 

 Sioiftiana Pfr., Stenogyra (Obeliscus) terebraster Pfr., Stenogyra 

 (Subulina) octona Ch. , Stenogyra (Subulina) acicularis Shuttl. 



No type species was selected, nor did Dr. von Martens name one 

 in treating of the group in the second edition of Albers' Die 

 Heliceen. It is obvious that Stenogyra cannot replace the older 

 groups mentioned above, but can only be used for some constituent 

 of the mass not already provided with a name. Such a one is 

 found in the so-called Obeliscus of Shuttleworth' s list; for, as 

 explained above, Obeliscus cannot be used in this connection. We 

 would therefore restrict Stenogyra to the Obeliscus of Shuttle- 

 worth's list, taking S. terebraster as the type. Other large Antil- 

 lean species, such as S. Salleana of San Domingo and S. gigas of 

 Cuba belong here, with probably the larger continental species 

 grouping around S. obeliseus. None of the species are known 

 anatomically, but the small apical whorls and more numerous 

 volutions separate them from those now referred to Neobeliscus.

 gigas (Poey) with N. cuneus (Pfr. ). 



Genus CALLIONEPION nov. 

 Shell turreted, slowly tapering, with diamond-granulate nepionie 

 shell of about 2h whorls, retained in the adult, the subsequent 

 whorls differently sculptured. Type species with 9i moderately 

 convex whorls, apex very obtuse. Aperture ovate, with slightly 

 expanded outer lip, the columellar lip with free expanded edge (as 

 in Bulimulus or Opeas); columella with a small, rather sharp 

 oblique median fold. 



Genitalia (PI. XY, fig. 8) without accessory organs; atrium 

 short. J 1 system with the penis large, elongate, the vas deferens 

 inserted at its apex, beyond which a hollow tube or sack (fig. 8, x. ) 

 of unknown nature extends, terminating in a short retractor mus- 

 cle; talon (r. ) large, composed of a thick curved basal portion and 

 a slightly longer, narrow terminal part. 1 system with the vagina 

 short; spermatheca globular, lodged near the heart, its duct long 

 and slender; free oviduct very short, the convoluted portion un- 

 usually long ; albumen gland well developed. Hermaphrodite duct 

 moderately convoluted. 



Apparently oviparous, the young shell when hatched about one- 

 tenth the length and less than one-third the diameter of the adult 

 shell. 



The right eye-retractor muscle passes between c? and 9 branches 

 of genital system; the penis retractor muscle is inserted upon the 

 diaphragm. 



The jaw is lost, and the radula obtained is frayed at the 

 edges, so that the number of teeth in a transverse row cannot be 

 -tared, but it was probably not over fifty. The rachis consists of 

 well-developed teeth, fully as wide as the laterals, with square basal 

 plate and tricuspid reflection, the middle cusp large, though shorter 

 than the basal plate; the side cusps small. In the lateral teeth an 

 inner cusp is absent. Marginals similar, with oblique mesocone, 

 acute small ectocone and short basal plate.

the free, expanded edge of the columellar lip, aud the sharp 

 though small median fold on the columella, are characters sunder- 

 ing Callionepion from other South American Stenogyroid genera. 



The vagina is much shorter than in Rumina (where it equals the 

 length of the spermatheca duct), and the duct of the spermatheca 

 is longer than in Rumina, Achatina, Neobeliscw or Opens, being 

 caught with the gut in the loop of the aorta, and consequently the 

 spermatheca lies near the heart, as shown in the diagram annexed 

 to fig. 8a. 



In the wide teeth of the median row, this genus differs remark- 

 ably from all known American Achatinidce of the " Stenogyra " 

 form, departing from the type of dentition nearly universal in the 

 family. 



Callionepion Iheringi n. sp. PI. XV, figs. 11, 12, 13. 



Shell rimate, turreted, narrow, subregularly tapering ; surface 

 glossy, covered with a greenish cuticle, somewhat irregularly plicat- 

 ulate, decussated by numerous minute spiral striae or very short cu- 

 ticular processes, which are lost by wear from the greater part of the 

 shell, and then appear as lightly impressed lines. Whorls 9^, mod- 

 erately convex, separated by impressed sutures, the apex very obtuse, 

 with depressed tip, surface of the earlier 2^ whorls cut into an 

 evenly granose pattern by close, deep, obliquely descending grooves 

 intersecting at right angles; last whorl rounded at base. Aperture 

 irregularly ovate, slightly oblique, its length contained Z\ times in 

 that of the shell; peristome thin, acute, the outer margin slightly 

 expanded, columellar margin reflexed, dilated, impressed at its 

 insertion, bearing a low, narrow submedian oblique fold. Internal 

 pillar slender and nearly straight, with a low spiral fold within the 

 last whorl.

The peculiar apical sculpture separates this from all other South 

 American Stenogyroid species known to me. When this sculpture 

 is obscured by erosion, as occurs to a greater or less extent in many 

 adult shells, the slightly expanded Up and median fold of the 

 columella are still obvious recognition marks. The type is No.

Summary. — The two genera described above are not closely 

 related to forms known anatomically from other regions, and there- 

 fore throw no light upon the vexed questions of the alliance of the 

 South American fauna to that of tropical Africa or other regions. 

 They can have no bearing on the hypothetical Antarctica. Neo- 

 beli^cu-s is the most highly specialized member of the Achatinidce 

 known, and apparently forms no capsule of albumen, but nourishes 

 the embryo directly, as in mammals. The teeth are ultra-achati- 

 noid, and the muscle system aberrant. Callionepion is probably an 

 individualized survivor of a primitive achatinoid, retaining the 

 early form of teeth. There is no reason for believing that either 

 ffenus reached South America from without.

August 1. 

 Mr. Benjamin Smith Lyman in the Chair. 



Nine persons present. 



The deaths of J. Blodget Britton and Daniel G. Brinton, M.D., 

 members, were announced. 



In compliance with the recommendation of the Committee on 

 the Hayden Memorial Geological Award, the medal and the interest 

 on the fund for 1899 were conferred on Prof. Gilles Joseph 

 Gustave Dewalque, of the University of Liege, Belgium. 



The following biographical note was presented with the report : 



G. J. Gustave Dewalque, Professor Emeritus of the Uni- 

 versity of Liege, Belgium, was born at Stavelot, December 2, 

 1826. He entered the University of Liege, received first prize 

 for a memoir on The Nature of Chemical Affinity in 1849 at 

 the University competition. He graduated as a Doctor of Medi- 

 cine, Surgery and Obstetrics in 1853, and Doctor of Natural 

 Sciences in 1854. The cholera having reappeared, he was made 

 resident physician of the temporary hospital of St. Julien in 1854; 

 then of St. Thomas in 1855. He sought, but without success, 

 the microbe of cholera in the air, but proved the transmission of 

 the malady from man to the dog. He became a member of the 

 Council of Public Health of the province in 1857; General Sec- 

 retary in 1872; President in 1875, and Honorary President in 

 1895. He was one of the organizing members of the Malacologi- 

 cal Society in 1863, and of the Society of Public Medicine in 

 1877. He was Chairman of the Committee on Medical Topog- 

 raphy from its origin. 



He commenced instructing as supplementary Professor of Physics 

 and Chemistry in 1850 at the College of Liege; was made 

 Demonstrator of the course of Human and Comparative Physi- 

 ology at the University in 1852, and joined with these functions, 

 at the request of A. Dumont, in 1855, those of Conservator of 

 the Mineral Collections and Instructor in Mineralogy and Geology 

 at the School of Mines. The unexpected death of his illustrious 

 master opened to him these chairs in 1857. L. G. de Koninck very 




376 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



shortly thereafter transferred to him the instruction in paleon- 

 tology. In 1897 he was admitted to the degree of Emeritus. 



Having published, for the use of his pupils, an Atlas of Crystal- 

 lography and a Description of the Crystalline System, he issued in 

 1858 the Prodromus of a Geological Description of Belgium, a 

 model of clearness, precision and science, which exercised the great- 

 est influence on the study of geology in Belgium. 



In 1874 he founded the Geological Society of Belgium, of which 

 he has been the General Secretary from its origin to the year 

 1898, when the advance of years induced him to retire. He was 

 made Honorary General Secretary, and a medallion in bronze was 

 presented to him with his portrait in profile. He was made Chev- 

 alier of the Order of Leopold in 1870, Officer in 1881, and Com- 

 mander in 1892. 



He became a member of the Academy of Science in 1854, was 

 its President in 1870. He is President of the Committee of Na- 

 tional Biography (of which he has been a member since its origin 

 in 1860), to which he has furnished more than eighty notices. 



In cooperation with the Geological Society, he suggested the 

 preparation of a detailed geological map of Belgium at the expense 

 of the State. This resulted iu a suitable recognition of capable 

 geologists, so that in ten or twelve years a map consisting of 226 

 sheets on a 4o\iroo- sca ^ e w ^l have been completed. He translated 

 the Review of Pyrogenetic Mineral*, of Gurlt (1857); the memoir 

 of Beyrich on the Tertiary Series of North Germany (1857) ; The 

 Chapter of the Siluria of Sir Roderick Murchison: The Paleozoic 

 Terranes of the Rhenish and Belgian Provinces (1860); The 

 History of the Names " Cambrian " and " Silurian" by the regretted 

 T. Sterry Hunt (1875); and finally the Paleocene Faxma of 

 Copenhagen, by A. von Koenen (1886). 



He also made numerous excursions abroad, notably to Devon- 

 shire and Wales, which enabled him to establish the correlation of 

 the Cambrian formations of England and Belgium (1873). At 

 the first International Geological Congress, held in Paris in 1879, 

 he was appointed Secretary of the Committee on Classification and 

 Uniformity of Nomenclature, and this appointment was repeated 

 at Bologna, Berlin and London. The reports which he presented 

 to the Congress of Bologna and Berlin are distinguished by 

 impartiality, clearness and method.

On the occasion of his promotion to the grade of Commander he 

 wd< presented with his bust in white marble. The account of this 

 manifestation of high esteem enumerates twenty-five publications 

 relative to natural or medical sciences, and two hundred and 

 eighty-six concerning the mineral sciences. Some of these latter 

 related to mineralogy and paleontology, notably the description of 

 the fossils of the secondary formations of Luxembourg in collabora- 

 tion with F. Chapuis, crowned by the Academy in 1851. The 

 greater part are concerned with the geology of Belgium, notably 

 his notes on the Lias, in which he solved the question of the Sand- 

 stone of Luxembourg and of Hettange ; those on the anthracitic of 

 the Condroz, in which he assigned, after others, but often differ- 

 ently, the Devonian beds to the Eifelian or middle Devonian, and 

 the Famennian or upper Devonian ; his discussion with M. Dupont 

 relating to the gaps which that observer admitted in the Carbonif- 

 erous limestone; on the plicated appearance of the beds of the 

 Ardennes; on the granite of Lammersdorf ; on mineral waters, es- 

 pecially of Spa ; on the pudding-stone of the Baraque-Michel : 

 the origin of the labors which have demonstrated that the Tertiary 

 (Oligocene) sea covered the Ardennes; on the giant pot-holes of 

 the same region, and finally his remarkable geological map of 

 Belgium and the neighboring provinces on a scale of 5tto/ooT7» * ne 

 minuteness of which does not prevent one from realizing the im- 

 mense progress accomplished since the death of Dumont, in the 

 corrections made on the German map in certain divisions of the 

 Devonian, and in the beds of Daleiden which are represented for 

 the first time. 



Prof. Dewalque has also published a coup d'oeil of the advance 

 of the mineral sciences in Belgium (1870) ; the Secular Report on 

 the Works of the Academy (Mineral Sciences, 1872), and the 

 Catalogue of the Works on Mineralogy, Geology, and Paleontology, 

 together with the Geological Maps which are found in the Principal 

 Libraries of Belgium, issued by the Geological Society in 1884. 



Monazite in Delaware County, Pa. — Mr. S. Harbert Ham- 

 ilton stated that the occurrence of crystals of Monazite in the 

 feldspar of the ancient rocks of eastern Pennsylvania had been 

 reported to the Students' Mineralogical Club by Mr. J. Glading 

 Dailey. 



Monazite has been noted previously from several localities in the 




378 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899, 



crystalline rocks of the Atlantic coast, but never before from Penn- 

 sylvania. The particular locality discovered by Mr. Dailey is in 

 the quarry just below Morgan's Station on the southeast side of 

 Chester creek, about five miles from the city of Chester. The 

 associate minerals are magnetite, hematite, green mica, quartz 

 and a flesh-colored feldspar in which the crystals, about one-quarter 

 of an inch in length, were observed. Two or three perfect crys- 

 tals were found and a quantity of fragments. Mr. Dailey has sub- 

 jected his find to the following examination : 



" The best crystals were examined with the aid of a 

 polariscope, and what appeared to be parallel extinction 

 was observed, thus excluding the possibility of its being dis- 

 torted garnet, which had been suggested, and it apparently 

 confined the crystallization to practically tetragonal or 

 y^Sv/ orthorhombic; but upon looking up Monazite, which 

 ^-V had been suggested, the angles of extinction were found to 

 very nearly approach right angles; thus the apparent parallel ex- 

 tinction of a monoclinic mineral was explained. Measurements 

 (rough, to be sure, for the surfaces did not permit the reflection 

 of a well-defined image) were made with the reflecting goniometer 

 of two angles, one of which was an essential angle. For angle 

 a w, which according to Dana is 39° 12' 30", was found 39° and 

 about 19', and angle v v, which should be 73° 19' 00", was found 

 about 73° 30'. 



A qualitative chemical analysis was thought necessary to insure 

 and corroborate the above. The pulverized fragments were taken 

 to dryness with hydrochloric acid, taken up with water and precipi- 

 tated with oxalic acid. This precipitate gave upon ignition the 

 peculiar red color of the cerium group. Another portion of pow- 

 der upon fusion wifh white flux and solution in nitric acid gave 

 with ammonium molybdate the characteristic reaction for phos- 

 phorus.

Confirmation of the Generic Characters of Ashmunella. — Dr. 

 Pilsbry stated that living specimens of a new form of Ashmu- 

 nella (A. thomsoniana porterce Pils. & Ckll. ) had been found

 It proves to be similar in anatomy to the type of the genus, thus 

 continuing the generic diagnosis.

DESCRIPTIONS OF SIX NEW AMERICAN RABBITS. 

 BY GERRIT S. MILLER, JR. 



The collection of rabbits in the United States National Museum 

 contains the following hitherto undescribed forms, all from parts 

 of America north of Panama. I publish this paper here by per- 

 mission of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. 



Subgenus MACROTOLAGUS Mearus. 

 Lepus asellus sp. nov. 



Type adult $ (skin and skull), No. f£$$4 United States National 

 Museum, collected at the city of San Luis Potosi, Mexico, October 

 22, 1891, by P. L. Jouy. Original number, 270. 



General Characters. — In size and color most like Lepus merriami 

 Mearns, but tail shorter and ears much longer, the latter fully 

 equalling those of the largest L. texianus. Nape scarcely darker 

 than back. Skull slightly heavier than in Lepus merriami, the 

 nasals broader, and the audital bullae larger. 



Color. — Back an irregular grizzle of black and white, darker 

 along median line. Sides and rump slightly paler than back. 

 Tail entirely clear black above, grayish white beneath. The black 

 caudal area is continued forward over rump, gradually becoming 

 narrower, and finally disappearing about 80 mm. from base of 

 tail. Nape like back, only more finely grizzled. A small dusky 

 area immediately behind base of ear. Ears broccoli brown, paler 

 behind, rimmed with buff. The buff rim is continuous except 

 where interrupted by the black tip. It is paler along outer margin 

 (near base of which it becomes nearly white), and darker along 

 inner margin, where the hairs are noticeably lengthened. Tip of 

 ear black, the dark area about 40 mm. long and at base 25 mm. 

 in width. It lies mostly on the outer half of the ear. Posterior 

 base of ear blackish for about 20 mm. Crown of head like back, 

 but more closely grizzled. Cheeks like sides. An indistinct, nar- 

 row, pale area surrounding eye. Chin, upper part of throat and 

 whole of belly white, very faintly tinged with bluish gray. Neck 

 ruff well developed, buff sprinkled with a few blackish hairs. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 381 



Legs light smoke gray tinged with bluish gray on inner side of 

 thighs and with broccoli brown on front feet and forearms. Hind 

 feet whitish above. On the front legs the white of the belly ex- 

 tends in a narrow line to wrist; on the hind legs to feet. 



Skull and Teeth. — The skull of Lepus asellus is about the size 

 of that of L. merriami or the small races of L. texianus. It is con- 

 spicuously smaller than that of Lepus allini or L. texianus texianus. 

 In form it differs from the skull of L. merriami in its broader. 

 deeper rostrum, broader nasals, wider interpterygoid fossa, longer, 

 slightly narrower basioccipital, and slightly larger audital bulla?. 



Measurements. — External measurements of type (from fresh 

 specimen by collector) : Total length, 558; tail vertebra 1 , 62; bind 

 foot, 120; ear from crown, 175. 



Cranial measurements of type: greatest length, 100; basal length, 

 84; basilar length, 78; henselion 1 to posterior edge of bony palate 

 (median), 37; least (lateral) length of bony palate, 7; posterior 

 edge of bony palate to hamular, 21; length of incisive foramen, 

 26; width of incisive foramina, 10.4; zygomatic breadth, 44; inter- 

 orbital breadth (inclusive of supraorbital processes), 30; greatest 

 breadth of braincase, 32.4; breadth of rostrum at base of zygo- 

 mata, 27; greatest (diagonal) length of nasals, 43; greatest 

 breadth across both nasals, 22; least breadth across both nasals, 

 15.4; depth of brain case at anterior end of basioccipital, 30; 

 diastema, 28.4; maxillary molar series (alveoli), 16.8; mandible, 

 74: diastema, 23; mandibular molar series (alveoli), 17. 



Specimens Examined. — I have seen only the type of this species. 



General Remarks. — Lepus asellus is readily distinguishable from 

 L. merriami by its somewhat smaller size, relatively as well as ac- 

 tually much longer ears, and gray nape. From the Mexican Lepus 

 calloti*, two specimens of which Mr. Jouy collected at Guadala- 

 jara, Jalisco, it is instantly recognizable by its black-tipped ears 

 and gray (not whitish) sides. 



Although four names have been based on Mexican jackrabbits, it 

 is easily shown that all refer to animals with white-tipped ears, 

 not in the least like Lepus asellus. Presumably the first of these 

 is Lepus callotis Wagler (Nat. Syst. der Amphibien mit voran- 

 (jehender Classif. der Saugeth. mid Vogel, p. 23, 1830). The 



1 Post-incisive homologue of gnathion. 




382 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



description of the animal is very brief, but positive reference is 

 made to the white outer surface of the ears. 2 Another name pub- 

 lished in 1830 is the Lepus mexicanus of Lichtenstein (Abhandl. 

 K. Akud. Wissensch. Berlin (1827), p. 101, 1830). This is 

 based on a Mexican specimen collected by Deppe, but, as in the 

 case of Wagler's L. callotis, no definite type locality is mentioned. 

 The author, referring to Hernandez, ' ' Citli sive Lepus, ' ' remarks that 

 the description of this animal is so brief that it has been hitherto 

 overlooked, but that it nevertheless refers to a well-marked species 

 characterized by the extreme length and breadth of the ears. 

 " Had he but added," Lichtenstein continues, " that these ears are 

 dark colored on their anterior half, and on the posterior, less con- 

 spicuous part wholly white, the two colors sharply divided at the 

 middle line, he would have sooner directed attention to an animal 

 that first reached Europe in a shipment from Mr. Deppe, and 

 which is deposited in our museum under the name Lepus mexi- 

 canus."* This description leaves no doubt that Lichtenstein had 

 in hand a member of the white-eared callotis group. Three years 

 later the same animal or a closely related form was described as 

 Lepus nigricaudatus by Bennett (Proc. Zobl. Soc. London, I, p. 

 41, 1833). Concerning the ears of this species the account reads : 

 " These are in front mixed black and yellow, giving a grizzled ap- 

 pearance ; on the hinder part they are entirely ochraceous for about 

 two-thirds of the length of the ear, the terminal third, as well as the 



tip and the hinder fringe, being white " This is one of the 



species " obtained by the [Zoological] Society from that part of 

 California which adjoins Mexico." Whatever it may be, it is evi- 

 dent that it is not the animal that I have called Lepus asellus. 

 The last of the names which need to be considered here is the 

 Lepus flavigularis of AVagler (Schreber's Sdugethiere, Supple- 

 mentband, Abth. iv, p. 106, 1844). It is based on a specimen 

 from no certain locality. While there is some doubt as to the

 above, and with dull white beneath; the extreme base inconspicu- 

 ously clear, dull white. 



Skull and Teeth. — The skull and teeth exactly resemble tb« >se 

 of Lepus bachmani bachmani, except that they appear to be 

 -lightly larger throughout, and the audital bulla? may be rela- 

 tively somewhat smaller.

the outer surface blackening ou the termiual fourth and aloni;- 

 anterior edge. Extreme anterior margin fringed with pale buff. 

 This border is continuous through whole periphery of ear, but is 

 broadest and composed of the longest hairs through lower anterior 

 half. Inner surface of ear thickly sprinkled with fine whitish 

 hairs. Crown of head slightly darker than back. Cheeks paler 

 than side-, but strongly shaded with black. A conspicuous whitish 

 area surrounding eye and broadening posteriorly to a width of 

 about 10 mm. Chin and upper part of throat dull white. Chest 

 and lower throat ochraceous buff 1 , darkened by a sparse sprinkling 

 of black tipped hairs. The hairs of this buff area are slightly 

 lengthened to form an inconspicuous ruff. Legs cinnamon rufous, 

 the gray of the sides extending over most of outer side of thigh, but 

 scarcely reaching below shoulder. White of belly extending down 

 inner side of hind leg and covering dorsum of pes. On front leg 

 it extends as a narrow band on inner side to carpus. Belly dull 

 white, strongly tinged Avith buff on chest. 



Skull and Teeth. — The skulls of Lepus fioridanus yucatanicus 

 average slightly larger than those of L. fioridanus aztecus, and the 

 zygomatic arches are relatively deeper and heavier. Otherwise I 

 can see no tangible differences in general form. Audital bulla? 

 considerably larger and more inflated than in L. fioridanus aztecus. 



Measurements. — External measurements of type : Total length, 

 430 mm. (estimated, skin stretched); hind foot, 198; ear from 

 crown, 71. Average of five specimens, including the type: Total 

 length, 412 (400-430 i; tail vertebrae, 33.5 (33-34; ; hind foot, 92 

 (85-98); ear from crown, 73.5 (68-75). These measurements are 

 taken from badly prepared skins, and are only approximately 

 reliable. 



Cranial meaurernents of type: Greatest length, 82 mm.; basal 

 length, 64; basilar length, 62; henselion to posterior edge of bony 

 palate (median), 33; least (lateral) length of bony palate, 7.8; pos- 

 terior edge of bony palate to hamular, 17; length of incisive fora- 

 men, 21; width of incisive foramina, 9.4; zygomatic breadth, 39; 

 interorbital breadth (inclusive of supraorbital processes), 20; 

 greatest breadth of brain case, 29; breadth of rostrum at base of 

 zygomata, 22.6; greatest (diagonal) length of nasals, 37; greatest 

 breadth across both nasals, 16; least breadth across both nasals

 tema, 23.6; maxillary molar series (alveoli), 14; mandible, 62; 

 diastema, 19; mandibular molar series (alveoli), 14.6. 



Specimen* Examined. — Six, all from the type locality. 



General Remarks. — Lepus floridanus yueatanicus and L. flori- 

 danus aztecus resemble each other rather closely, but differ in easily 

 recognizable characters. Lepus floridanus aztecus is the smaller ani- 

 mal of the two, with blacker back, more buffy sides and clearer gray 

 cheeks. The cranial differences between the two forms are well 

 marked. It is highly probable that these red rumped animals are 

 specifically distinct from Lepus floridanus. 



Lepus floridanus subcinctus subsp. nov. 



Type adult ? (skin and skull), No. ||;f|f United States Na- 

 tional Museum, collected at Hacienda El Molino, near Negrete, 

 Michoacan, Mexico, June 15, 1892, by P. L Jouy. Original 

 number, 415. 



General Characters. — Most like Lepus floridanus ehapmani Allen, 

 from Corpus Christi, Texas, but slightly larger, the ears longer, 

 aud color of under parts duller. Color of sides strongly encroach- 

 ing on dull white of bellv and almost dividing it immediately in 

 front of hind legs. Skull slightly larger than that of L. flori- 

 danus ehapmani, but not appreciably different in form. 



Color. — Back a uniform grizzle of black and buffy white, the 

 latter slightly predominating. On the sides and rump the white 

 becomes clearer and the black less conspicuous, thus producing a 

 paler grizzle slightly contrasted with that of back. Under fur on 

 back light, bluish gray with scarcely noticeable brownish tips. On 

 rump the basal color is slightly paler aud the tips of the hairs for 

 about 5 mm. are pinkish buff. Tail, snowy white beneath, hair 

 brown grizzled with whitish above. Nape patch light cinnamon. 

 Ears uniform gray faintly tinged with buff on inner surface, 

 and narrowly rimmed with blackish along external anterior border 

 near tip. Lower half of anterior border fringed with lengthened 

 white hairs. Crown of head like back, but slightly yellower. 

 Cheeks like sides of body, and distinctly shaded with black below 

 and behind eye. A whitish eye ring. Chin and upper part of 

 throat dull white, strongly darkened by the bluish gray bases of the 

 hairs. Chest and lower throat cream buff, darkened by a sparse 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 387 



sprinkling of black-tipped hair.- as well as by the gray under fur; 

 the hairs of the buff area lengthened to form an inconspicuous ruff. 

 This buff area extend.- backward to include front legs and form 

 a narrow but distinct line of demarkation between color of sides 

 and that of belly. Legs ochraceous buff tinged with cinnamon 

 on outer side and suffused with white on inner side and on upper 

 side of feet. Hind leg paler than front leg. Belly dull white, 

 the white area much narrower than in the ordinary forms of the 

 species, and nearly interrupted by an incomplete, dull buff girdle 

 immediately in front of the hind legs. 



Skull and Teeth. — Except for its greater size, the skull of Lepus 

 floridanus subcinctus does not differ appreciably from that of L. 

 floridanus chapmani. 



Measurements. — External measurements of type (from fresh 

 specimen by collector): Total length, 434; tail vertebrae, 47: hind 

 foot, 86; ear from crown, 76. 7 Average of three specimens in- 

 cluding the type: 8 Total length, 423 (400-435); tail vertebra?, 43 

 (42-47) ; hind foot, 87 (86-88) ; ear from crown, 74 (71-76). 



Cranial measurements of type: Greatest length, 7<i; basal 

 length, 62; basilar length, 58; henselion to posterior edge of bony 

 palate, 28; least (lateral) length of bony palate, 6; posterior edge 

 of bony palate to hamular, 18; length of incisive foramen, 18; 

 width of incisive foramina, 7.8; zygomatic breadth, 35; inter- 

 orbital breadth (inclusive of supraorbital processes), 19; greatest 

 breadth of brain case, 18; breadth of rostrum at base of zygomata,

 brain case at anterior end of basioccipital, 24; diastema, 20.4; 

 maxillary molar series (alveoli), 14; mandible, 58; diastema, 17; 

 mandibular molar series (alveoli), 12. 



Sjiecimens Examined. — Three, all from the type locality. 



General Remark*. — Lepm florid'/ nus subcinctus, though closely 

 related to L. floridanus chapmani, is readily distinguishable by its 

 longer ears. In color the two forms are essentially alike, but the 

 Mexican animal is slightly more dull, especially on the belly. On 



7 In the dry specimen the ear has shrunk to 70 mm. 



8 Four topotypes of Lepus floridanus chapmani, measured in flesh by 

 collector (ear excepted), average: Total length, 393 (390-400, ; tail verte- 

 bra?, 38.2 i 37-40 1 ; hind foot, 79 (76-83) ; ear from crown, 55 (52-57). 




388 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



the other hand it has more gray in the rump, which is distinctly 

 aler than the tail, while in L. floridanus chapman i rump and tail 

 are of essentially the same color. 



Lepus floridanus caniclunis subsp. nov. 



Type adult c? (skin and skull), No. 63,137, United States 

 National Museum, collected at Fort Clark, Texas, December '27, 

 1892, by Edgar A. Mearns. Original number, 2,172. 



General Characters. — Like Lepus floridanus chapmani Allen, but 

 slightly paler throughout; sides, rump and upper surface of tail 

 conspicuously paler, aud white of belly pure and not encroached 

 upon by color of sides. 



Color. — The color is so much like that of Lepus floridanus sub- 

 einetus that no detailed description is necessary. The pale band 

 on the hairs of the back is very slightly lighter, but the black tips 

 are considerably less abundant. This is true throughout the dorsal 

 and lateral surfaces. Head and ears distinctly paler than in 

 subeinctus. Rump aud tail conspicuously paler, the difference pro- 

 duced partly by a reduction in the number of black-tipped hairs, 

 but more especially by lightening the brown terminal band of the 

 under fur to ecru drab. Throat ruff, slightly paler than in sub- 

 cinetus. White of belly clear and pure throughout, not in the 

 least encroached upon by the color of the sides, as in the case of 

 L. floridanus subeinctus and Ij. floridanus chapmani. Color of 

 sides fading abruptly into that of belly without intervention of buff 

 lateral line. 



Skull and Teeth. — The skull of Lepus floridanus caniclunis is 

 slightly smaller than that of 7>. floridanus subeinctus, but it differs 

 in no wav in form. It is indistinguishable from the skull of Ij. 

 floridanus chapmani. 



Measurements. — External measurements of type (from fresh 

 specimen by collector): Total length, 395; tail vertebra?, 52; hind 

 foot, 87 ; ear from crown, 72. Average of ten specimens from 

 type locality: Total length, 382 (365-400); tail vertebra?, 57.8 

 (50-67); hind foot, 85.4 (80-90); ear from crown, 68.9 

 (64-72).

 of nasals, 29.2 (29); greatest breadth across both nasals, 14 (15) ; 

 least breadth across both nasals, 8.4 (8.4); depth of brain case 

 at anterior end of basioccipital, 22.8 (22.6); diastema, 18 (18); 

 maxillary molar series (alveoli), 12.4 (12 4); mandible, 49 (49); 

 mandibular molar series (alveoli), 13.6 (12.6). 



Specimens Examined. — Twelve, all from the type locality. 



General Remarks. — Lepus floridanus eaniclunis agrees with L. 

 floridanus ehapmani in its small size, but differs in much paler 

 color — therefore in exactly the opposite direction from the dark 

 L. floridanus alacer Bangs. Its most striking peculiarity, as com- 

 pared with its nearest allies, is its very pale rump and tail. 



Lepus floridanus sanctidiegi subsp. nov. 



Type adult 9 (skin and skull), No. 60,668 United States 

 National Museum, collected at monument No 258 (Pacific 

 Ocean), Mexican boundary line, San Diego County. California, 

 July 10, 1894, by Edgar A. Mearns. 



General Characters. — Like Lepus floridanus auduboni Baird, but 

 color paler throughout and belly pure white. Ears probably 

 longer than in true auduboni. 



Color. — Back a uniform grizzle of black and light cream buff, 

 the latter slightly predominating. On the sides the butt becomes 

 even paler, while the amount of black is noticeably reduced. On 

 the rump the buff fades abruptly to whitish gray, producing a 

 small but well-defined pale rump patch. Under fur on back light 

 bluish gray, changing to dull wood brown at tip. Long hairs of 

 back bluish gray at base, darkening to nearly black close below 

 broad subterminal cream buff band, and black at tip. Tail dark 

 brown above, the hairs inconspicuously paler tipped ; snowy white 

 beneath. Nape patch clear ochraceous buff, slightly more tawny 

 than the figure given by Ridgway (Nomencl. of Color*, pi. v, 




•'190 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



fig. 10). The nape patch is very large, extending back as far as 

 the point reached by the tips of the ears, and even suffusing the 

 fur for a short distance beyond. It also extends on each side of 

 the neck to angle of jaw. Ears gray internally and externally, 

 blackening at tip outside, and margined with whitish. Lower 

 half of ear distinctly paler than crown of head, and wholly with- 

 out, dusky shading. Crown of head about like back, but more 

 finely grizzled. Cheeks slightly browner than sides of body, not 

 darker posteriorly than anteriorly. A dull whitish eye ring, nearly 

 interrupted above and below. Chin and upper part of throat 

 white, faintly tinged with plumbeous. Chest and lower throat 

 cream buff. Legs ochraceous buff, the white of belly extending to 

 back of hind feet, and to wrists. Dorsal surface of front feet 

 cream buff. Back of thighs suffused with cream buff. Belly pure 

 white, faintly tinged with plumbeous. 



Skull and Teeth. — Having no skulls of Lejms jloridanus audu- 

 boni at hand, I am unable to compare that of the present race with 

 its nearest relative. As compared with that of L. jloridanus 

 holzneri (Mearns) the skull as a whole is slightly smaller, the 

 brain case is relatively broader and shorter and the audital bulla3 

 are perceptibly larger. 



Measurement*. — External measurements of type (from fresh 

 specimen by collector): Total length, 385; tail vertebra?, 63; 

 hind foot, 85; ear from crown, 78. 



Cranial measurements of type: Greatest length, 69 ; basal 

 length, 56; basilar length, 52; henselion to posterior edge of bony 

 palate, 26; least (lateral) length of bony palate, 5.4; posterior 

 edge of bony palate to hamular, 16.4; length of incisive foramen, 

 1 8 ; width of incisive foramina, 6 ; zygomatic breadth, 33 ; inter- 

 orbital breadth (inclusive of supraorbital processes), 19; greatest 

 breadth of brain case, 25; breadth of rostrum at anterior base of 

 zygomata, 16; greatest (diagonal) length of nasals, 29; greatest 

 breadth across both nasals, 13.6; least breadth across both nasals, 

 8.4; depth of brain case at anterior end of basioccipital, 23; 

 diastema, 18.4; maxillary molar series (alveoli), 12.8; mandible, 

 50; diastema, 15; mandibular molar series (alveoli), 13.6.

 ern part of San Diego County, California, and adjacent Lower 

 California.

DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW SPECIES OF MEXICAN LAND AND FRESH- 

 WATER MOLLUSKS. 



BY II KXKY A. PLLSBEY. 



During February,. March and April of this year, Mr. and Mrs. 

 S. N. Rhoads made a journey through parts of eastern and cen- 

 tral Mexico, their chief object being zoological investigation and 

 collecting. Their researches were mainly confined to the States of 

 Vera Cruz, Mexico, Michoaean and Nuevo Leon. 



The mollusks collected, especially thoss from the State last 

 named, prove to be of considerable interest, and a full report will 

 be prepared later. Meantime the following forms, recognized as 

 new, may be described : 

 Schazicheila fragilis n. sp. 



Shell subglobose, about the form of 8. alata Mke. ; thin, rather 

 fragile, reddish; the spire conoidal; whorls 4, the last rounded at 

 the periphery, impressed in the center below. Sculpture of very 

 numerous short cuticular spiral line. Aperture semicircular, 

 slightly oblique, with a very slight sinus above; peristome thin, 

 slightly expanded; columellar callus thin and small. Alt. 4.5, 

 diam. 6 mm. 



Diente, near Monterey, State of Nuevo Leon, Mexico. 



Differs from 8. alata and 8. pannucea in the smaller size, more 

 fragile texture, and the very much shallower notch at the upper 

 termination of the outer lip. It is a far smaller species than .S'. 

 nicoleti Shuttl. or S. hidalgoana Dall. I do not know of any 

 description of " »S'. minima Pfr. ," figured by Strebel on PL 3, 

 fig. G, of the Beit ray Mex. Land- unci Susswasser- Conchy lien, 

 Heft IV, but the figures, though insufficient for identification in 

 the absence, of text or locality, look considerably like S. fragilis. 

 About twenty specimens were collected, part of them quite fresh, 

 but without opercula. 

 Schazicheila vanattai n. sp. 



Shell thick lens-shaped, rather low conoid above, convex below 

 the strong peripheral carina, reddish brown, rather thin. Whorls 




392 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



4, the first red or corneous, somewhat projecting, the rest but 

 slightly convex, more or less encrusted, but showing no cuticular 



fringes, merely very line spiral lines in well-preserved specimens: 

 the last whorl keeled throughout, somewhat impressed in the center 

 below. Aperture slightly oblique, semioval; peristome thin, 

 slightly expanded, with a small, moderately deep sinus above. 

 Umbilical callus thin. Operculum unkuown. 



Alt. b.b, diam. 6.8 mm. 



Alt. 4.3, diam. 6 mm. 



Diente, near Monterey, with S. fragilis. 



Distinct by its strong peripheral keel. Named in honor of Mr. 

 E. G. Vanatta, whose assistance in the identification of the pres- 

 ent collection is hereby acknowledged. 



Valvata humeralis, var. patzcuarensis n. v. 



This name is applied to the form from Lake Patzcuaro, noticed 

 in my paper on the shells of the Academy Expedition, these 

 Proceedings, 1891, p. 326. It is larger, far more robust and 

 elevated than V humeralis ; there is no angulation or shoulder 

 on the upper surface of the whorls; and the umbilicus is decidedly 

 smaller. V. strebeli C. and F., based upon V. humeralis Strebel, 

 differs in the less elevated and robust form, larger umbilicus, and 

 judging from Strebel' s figures, the greater interruption of the cir- 

 cular aperture by the penultimate whorl. A specimen of var. 

 patzcuarensis measures: Alt. 5, diam. 5, length of aperture 2.5, 

 width 2.4 mm. 



Polygyra rhoadsi n. sp. 



Shell depressed, with very low conic, almost flat spire, and small, 

 cylindrical umbilicus which at the last whorl opens widely in an 

 arcuate rimation; last 1^ whorls rib-striate, the ribs strong, nar- 

 row, separated by smooth intervals wider than themselves, continu- 

 ing on the base ; spire smoother, the first li whorls smooth. 

 Whorls slightly more than 5, moderately convex above, slowly 

 widening, the last whorl decidedly wider, very convex, having the 

 convex periphery situated above the middle of the whorl, cou- 

 rt -xly slanting below the periphery, subangular at the margin of 

 the umbilicus, within which there is a groove parallel to the rima- 

 tion. Behind the lip the suture is abruptly and rather deeply 

 deflexed, and the whorl is deeply constricted. Aperture small. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 393 



subcircular, nearly closed by the large teetli ; peristome reflexed, 

 continuous in a raised callus across the parietal wall. Teeth: 

 parietal fold a large, sinuous tongue-like process, the lower ramus 

 of which is erect, the upper one rising in a point where it joins the 

 upper termination of the lip, the space between the branches 

 concave; outer lip bearing a strong, concave, callous rib, ending 

 below in a compressed tooth; basal margin bearing a similar com- 

 pressed tooth, extending outward on the lip, and separated from 

 that on the outer lip by a deep sinus. 



Alt. 4, diam. 10 mm. ; greatest width of the umbilicus 3 2 mm. 



Topo Chico, near Monterey, State of Kuevo Leon, Mexico. 



Closely allied to P. implicata Beck, with which it agrees in the 

 general form and the armature of the aperture. It differs from 

 implicata in the strongly ribbed surface, less convex base, <le- 

 cidedly narrower central umbilical opening and greater deviation 

 of the last whorl, which differentiates the median opening from 

 the rimation much more sharply than in P. implicata. 



P. rhoadsi differs from P. oppilata in being larger, with differ- 

 ent sculpture and narrower umbilicus. 



Polygyra suprazonata n- sp. 



Shell depressed subglobose with low conoid spire and very narrow 

 though deeply perforating umbilicus, somewhat enlarged at its 

 opening; glossy, slightly wrinkle -striate, finely malleated in places; 

 reddish brown, paler around the umbilicus and with a wide whitish 

 band above the periphery. Whorls oh, those of the spire slowly 

 increasing, the last wider, double the width of the preceding 

 whorl, abruptly deflexed in front, rounded at the periphery and 

 beneath, deeply constricted behind the lip. Aperture obloug, very 

 oblique, with reflexed, white peristome; pai'ietal fold a rather small 

 oblique lamina recurved in a very short branch above ; outer lip 

 with a small tooth, above which there is a strong concave rib; 

 basal lip bearing a small compressed tubercle and a slight thicken- 

 ing to the left of the tubercle. 



Alt. 6.5, diam. 12 mm.; width of umbilicus 1.5 mm. 



Alt. 5.7, diam. 10.2 mm.; width of umbilicus 1 mm. 



Tzintzuntzan, State of Michoacan. 



This is one of the largest Mexican species. It is allied to P. 

 chiapensis (Pfr. ) and P. matermontana Pils., differing from the 




3^4 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



former in the distinct basal tooth, bi-ramose parietal lamina, colora- 

 tion, etc., and from P. matermontana it differs in being more 

 robust with far less open umbilicus and different coloration. P. 

 nelsoni Dall (Nautilus, xi, p. 74), of which I have seen the 

 types, is another species of the same group. 



Praticolella strebeliana n. sp. 



Shell narrowly uinbilicated, rather depressed, thin; uniform, pale 

 corneous, having a dull sheen as if frosted, caused by an exces- 

 sively minute roughening of the surface. Spire low conic ; whorls 

 4f , the first one glossy, obtuse, the rest slowly widening until the 

 last, which is decidedly wider, moderately deflexed in front, the 

 periphery obtusely angular on the first half, becoming rounded on 

 the latter portion; scarcely any constriction behind the lip, but 

 opaque there. Aperture oblique, wider than high, shortly ellip- 

 tical, moderately excised by the parietal wall; peristome expanded, 

 narrowly reflexed, with a slight rib-like thickening within; mar- 

 gins approaching, the basal regularly arcuate, columellar margin a 

 little dilated at the insertion, slightly impinging on the narrow 

 umbilicus. 



Alt. 7.5, diam. 12 mm.; aperture, oblique alt. 5.7, width 7.2 

 mm., including peristome (type). 



Alt. 6.5, diam. 10.2 mm. (smallest adult specimen). 



Diente, near Monterey, State of Nuevo Leon, Mexico. 



Pruticolella amp la (Pfr. ), which is the nearest to this species, 

 differs in being far more globose, with a rounded-lunate aperture 

 and more deeply arcuate basal lip, somewhat as in Eulota similaris, 

 while this species has a transversely elliptical, smaller aperture, 

 with far less arcuate basal lip, and much more depressed body-whorl. 

 P. berlandieriana and griseola are not closely allied to the present 

 species. 



PraticoleUn strebeliana is named in honor of Hermann 

 Strebel, one of the ablest investigators of the Mexican mollus- 

 can fauna. 



Numerous fresh specimens were collected, but only one was found 

 living. 

 Thysanophora proxima n. sp. 



Similar to T. conspurcatella (Morel.), but with more elevated 

 spire, narrower umbilicus and far wider spaced oblique cuticular 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 395 



riblets. Whorls 4i, very convex, the last well rounded. Aper- 

 ture somewhat oblique, subrotund. 



Alt. 2.8, diam. 3.7 mm. 



Uruapam, State of Michoacan, Mexico. 



About twenty specimens were collected at the above locality by 

 Mr. and Mrs. Rhoads. Several immature shells of the same 

 species Avere taken at Morelia, Michoacan, and a few occurred at 

 Patzcuaro and Huingo in the same State. In Michoacan it seems 

 to replace T. conspurcatella of the more tropical region eastward. 



T. impura (Pfr. ) and T. hornii (Gabb) are closely allied species, 

 the former differing in the absence of oblique cuticular laminae. 



A Thysanophora similar to T. cccca, but more elevated, was 

 collected at Morelia, Michoacan. If the high contour is constant, 

 it probably indicates another subspecies at least; but only one 

 specimen was obtained. 

 Omphalina montereyensis n. sp. 



Shell about the size and general contour of 0. inornata, de- 

 pressed, umbilicated, the umbilicus about one-twelfth the diameter 

 of the shell. Surface glossy, smooth, with slight growth-wrinkles, 

 but no other sculpture. Whorls 5h, rather flattened, and slowly 

 increasing, the last whorl very much wider, more than double the 

 width of the preceding one, rounded at the periphery ; rather 

 flattened beneath. Aperture oblique, broadly lunate oval. 



Alt. 6, diam. 12; oblique height of aperture 5, width 6 mm. 



Diente, near Monterey, State of Xuevo Leon, Mexico. 



Numerous specimens were collected. It somewhat resembles 

 0. paradensis Pfr., but is much more depressed. 

 Glandina rhoadsi n. sp. 



Shell oblong-fusiform, rather thin, glossy, reddish brown, with 

 some slightly darker longitudinal streaks and whitish lines. 

 Surface weakly and rather unevenly striated longitudinally, the 

 stride stronger near the suture ; no spiral sculpture. Spire elongated, 

 with slightly convex outlines; apex obtuse; whorls 7^ to 8, the 

 earlier ones regularly widening, the later two or three more rapidly 

 increasing; sutures moderately impressed, very slightly crenulated 

 by the fold- stria? ; not margined. Last whorl somewhat com- 

 pressed, tapering below. Aperture small, rather narrow, a little 

 less than one-half the total length of the shell, in adult shells; 

 columella only weakly concave. 




396 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



Alt. 52, diam. 18, length of aperture 24 mm. 



Alt. 45, diam. 16i, length of aperture 23 mm. 



Alt. 42, diam. 14, length of aperture 21i mm. 



Diente, near Monterey, State of Xuevo Leon, Mexico. 



The last measurements are of a specimen not quite mature, with 

 l}x whorls. 



It is somewhat like G. longula or G. sing ley ana, but lacks any 

 trace of spiral striation; the suture is only weakly crenulated, and 

 not marginate. It is smoother than G. liebmanni and G. aude- 

 bardi, especially at the sutures, and is of a more slender form. 



Glandina dalli n. sp. 



Shell thin, slender, turreted and slowly tapering above, broadest 

 near the base, which is rather " saccate." Brownish corneous, 

 slightly translucent, smooth and glossy throughout, except for 

 rather separated, very short impressed grooves below the sutures 

 forming a series of very short, low, broad folds there; and there 

 are a few impressed, sinuous, longitudinal grooves, reminiscent of 

 former peristomes, on the last whorl or two. Spire long, with 

 very slightly convex lateral outlines and quite obtuse apex. 

 Whorls Sh, slightly convex, the last one compressed laterally and 

 decidedly full below. Aperture small, very narrow above, broad 

 and slightly squarish below, the outer lip thin, vertical, bent 

 forward in the middle, strongly retracted below, giving the basal 

 lip au effuse aspect. Columella short, strongly concave and con- 

 spicuously truncated below. 



Alt. 20, diam. 6.2, length of aperture 9.5 mm. 



Alt. 18, diam. 6.3, length of aperture 9.5 mm.

Diente, near Monterey, State of Nuevo Leon, Mexico. 



Glandina dalli belongs to a small group of Mexican species of 

 small size and smooth, glossy surface, but seems abundantly distinct 

 from any hitherto described. Compared with G. bellula C. and 

 F., this species differs in being of narrower form, with longer, 

 narrower aperture, the posterior portion of which is more pro- 

 longed and much narrower; also in the comparatively simple 

 suture. It is more lengthened than G. oblonga Pfr. , and less 

 plaited at the sutures. G. ambigua Pfr. is stouter in form; and G. 

 conularis Pfr. has a wider aperture and far more arcuate outer lip.

Glandina michoacanensis n. sp. 



Shell obesely fusiform, rather thin, of a rather dark dull reddish 

 color, Avith an irregular, pale sutural border. Surface slightly 

 shiniDg, coarsely aud irregularly plicate and fiuely plicatulate 

 longitudinally, the foldlets conspicuously decussated, cut into 

 oblong grains, the spirals becoming obsolete at the extreme base. 

 •Spire rather thick, continuing stout above, the apex obtuse. 

 Whorls 7 to ~h, the earlier 2h smooth, the next one evenly rib- 

 striated, the last whorl oblong, rather obese, tapering below. Su- 

 ture well impressed, coarsely and irregularly denticulate. Aperture 

 rather small, its length (measured obliquely) a little exceeding half 

 that of the shell; outer lip gently convex ; columella quite con- 

 cave in adult, straighter in immature specimens, strongly truncated 

 at base. 



Alt. 48.5, diam. 20.5, longest axis of aperture 25.7, greatest 

 width 9.5 mm. 



Uruapam, State of Michoacan, Mexico. 



This specks belongs to the first (Plexce) of the several sections 

 formed by Dr. von Martens in his excellent account of the genus in 

 the Biologia Cent ra/i- Americana. It might reasonably be supposed 

 that so large a species from central Mexico would be known, but 

 a thorough search through the literature, with the considerable 

 collection of the Academy as a basis for comparison, fails to locate 

 the specimens within any of the numerous Mexican species hitherto 

 described. The dark, reddish color and conspicuous sculpture are 

 its more striking features. 



Streptostyla novoleonis n. sp. 



Shell cylindric-oblong, blunt at the ends, dark reddish brown, 

 very glossy, almost smooth, the growth-wrinkles being incon- 

 spicuous. Spire short, conic, the apex obtuse. "Whorls 6i, slowly 

 increasing, the latter half or three-fourths of the last one very 

 rapidly descending, the last whorl generally suddenly deflexed at its 

 termination. Aperture very long and narrow; columella short, 

 rather thin, moderately twisted. 



Alt. 17.2, diam. 7, length of aperture 12 mm. 



Alt. 16, diam. 6.7, length of aperture 11.8 mm. 



Diente, near Monterey, State of Xuevo Leon, Mexico. 



Smaller than S. shvMleworthi and the varieties subordinated 




398 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



thereto by Dr. von Martens, short in the spire, markedly cylin- 

 drical, with the columella only weakly twisted. The region around 

 Monterey is very different in physical characteristics from that 

 inhabited by S. shuttleworthi. It is considerably further north 

 than Streptostyla has heretofore been found. 

 Salasiella pfeifferi n. n. 



This name is proposed for Achatina pulchella Pfr. , P. Z. S., 

 1856, p. 379, not Achatina pulshella Spix, 1827. 



Dr. E. von Martens has figured the type, Biologia Centra 11- 

 Americana, Mollusca, p. 83, pi. 5, f. 9. 

 Pseudosubulina berendti, var. occidentalis n. v. 



Numerous specimens collected at Uruapam, State of Michoacau, 

 represent a variety of the East Mexican P. berendti, distinguished 

 by the weaker, less crowded rib-stri?e aud wider aperture. Alt. 

 15, diam. 3.2, oblique length of aperture 3 mm.; whorls 12. Alt. 

 12.7, diam. 2.8, oblique length of aperture 2.8 mm. ; whorls 11|. 

 Pseudosubulina texoloensis n. sp. 



Shell turreted, imperforate, faintly greenish yellow tinted, com- 

 posed of numerous short, wide whorls, sculptured with close-set 

 rib-stria? separated by smooth, slightly wider intervals; outlines of 

 spire decidedly concave above. Whorls 10^, convex, the ribs 

 subobsolete on the base of the last one. Apex obtuse, the first 

 whorl rapidly widening, smooth, the second becoming very finely 

 rib-striate, the next three whorls more coarsely ribbed, scarcely 

 increasing in width or in the diameter of the spire ; following 

 whorls gradually widening aud increasing the diameter of the 

 spire; last whorl short, moderately convex, abruptly contracting 

 below. Aperture ovate- trapezoidal ; columella moderately con- 

 cave, abruptly truncated, Achatina-like, below. 



Alt. 9.2, diam. 2.5, length of aperture 2 mm. 



Texolo Falls, State of Vera Cruz, Mexico. 



The shortness of the whorls and contraction of the upper part of 

 the spire (as in the young of many species of Urocoptis), are the more 

 prominent features of this species. The columella is much more 

 strongly truncated than in P. berendti. Generic position not verified. 

 Spiraxis uruapamensis n. sp. 



Shell turreted-conic, decidedly tapering, the lateral outlines a 

 little concave above; corneous, with white riblets; apex obtuse. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 399 



Whorls Ih, very convex, separated by deeply impressed sutures; 

 first half whorl smooth, following whorl very finely lamellose- 

 striate; succeeding whorls with numerous, delicate, raised riblets, 

 about 42 in number on the penultimate whorl. Aperture short- 

 oval, somewhat trapezoidal; columella thick, strongly sinuous. 



Alt. 5.2, diam. 2 mm. 



Uruapam, State of Michoacan, Mexico. 



This species is more obtuse than 8. sulciferus and its variety 

 berendti; has more convex whorls than S. tenuecostatus Streb., and 

 is stouter than S. miradorensis Streb., with closer riblets. S. 

 tenuis is an allied form, which should be compared. 

 Opeas patzcuarense n. sp. 



Shell minute, slender, obtuse at the apex, slowly tapering, 

 rather cylindric or rod-shaped. Whitish corneous, glossy and 

 smooth, showing slight, sparse growth wrinkles under a lens. 

 Whorls 1\, moderately convex, the last tapering at base. Aper- 

 ture long, irregularly ovate; columella straight, vertical. 



Alt. 3, diam. 0.8 mm. 



Patzcuaro, State of Michoacan, Mexico. 



A very small species, unlike any other Mexican form known to 

 me. Numerous specimens were collected. 

 Opeas odiosum n. sp. 



Shell slender, turreted, completely imperforate, corneous, suffi- 

 ciently translucent to show the columella faintly through. Surface 

 glossy, irregularly scored by unequally spaced longitudinal grooves 

 and some slight wrinkles. General outlines of the spire straight; 

 apex obtuse. Whorls Sh, the earlier strongly convex, the last two 

 slightly flattened. Aperture ovate; outer lip thin, moderately 

 arched forward, columella slightly concave, forming a distinct 

 angle with the parietal wall. Alt. 6.9, diam. 2, longest axis of 

 aperture 1.5 mm. 



Patzcuaro, State of Michoacan, Mexico. 



The impressed grooves are similar in character to those of Vitrea 

 iu'Jentata and other species of Glyphxjalinia. About forty speci- 

 mens were collected. 

 Opeas rhoadsae n. sp. 



Shell slender, subulate, wholly imperforate, corneous and suffi- 

 ciently translucent to show the internal axis through the shell in

places. Surface glossy, sculptured with unequally spaced longitu- 

 dinal grooves, and showing a few slight growth-wrinkles in places. 

 General outlines of the spire straight. Apex obtuse. Whorls 9 

 to 9i, the earlier ones quite convex, the later four or five somewhat 

 flattened. Aperture small, ovate, the outer lip a trifle curved 

 forward in the middle; columella slender, concave. 



Alt. 7, diam. 1.9, longest axis of aperture 1.0 mm. 



Alt. 7, diam. 1.7, longest axis of aperture 1.6 mm. 



Dieute, near Monterey, State of Nuevo Leon, Mexico. 



Similar in sculpture and color to Opeas odiomm, but perceptibly 

 more slender in the spire, with smaller apex. These two species 

 have the general form of Opeas subula, but differ totally in sculp- 

 ture; they are also more brilliant and more transparent. The 

 columella is not at all twisted, and there is no trace of a basal 

 notch or truncation. This species, of which about fifteen speci- 

 mens were obtained, is named in honor of Mrs. Mary C. Rhoads. 

 Bifidaria prototypus n. sp. 



Shell small, sub cylindrical, somewhat taperiug above, brownish 

 corneous, thin. Whorls 5, convex ; apex obtuse. Aperture 

 truncate-oval; peristome expand^. Teeth : the parietal bifid, 

 composed of two lamina?, that on the light running outward to the 

 posterior termination of the outer lip, more or less united at its 

 iuner end with the left lamina, which is more deeply seated, and 

 enters deeply; a rather high tooth at the middle of the columella; 

 and a similar but smaller and short denticle moderately remote 

 from the lip-edge, at the junction of the outer with the basal walls 

 of the aperture. Usually there is a minute denticle above the 

 last-described denticle. 



Alt. 2.5, diam ] mm. 



Huingo, State of Michoacan, Mexico. 



This species has the general appearance of Pupa rupicola, but 

 differs markedly in dentition. There are only two denticles within 

 the outer lip, none at the base of the columella. The parietal 

 armature illustrates clearly the origin of the bifid fold of the 

 Bifidarice of the United States, retaining the ancestral form more 

 than any American species I have examined. There are two folds, 

 one to the right and more emerging, the other to the left and more 

 deeply entering ; the two more or less connected by a callus at the 

 inner termination of the ri^ht tooth. 






1899.] NATURAL . SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 401 



Succinea tlalpamensis n. sp. 



Shell pointed-oblong fragile, honey yellow or reddish, somewhat 

 translucent; strongly, finely and rather irregularly, closely wrinkled. 

 Spire slender, acuminate; whorls 2i, very obliquely convoluted, 

 the last scarcely convex above. Aperture very large, ovate, some- 

 what effuse at the base ; columella with a white thread-like edge. 



Alt. 15, diam. 8, longest axis of aperture 11.8, greatest width 

 7 mm. 



Alt. 14^, diam. 8^, longest axis of aperture 12, greatest width 

 lh mm. 



Near Tlalpam, State of Mexico, Mexico. 



Allied to S. return Lea (oralis Gld. non Say) and S. salleana 

 Pfr. Compared with the former, S. tlalpamensis has a decidedly 

 larger aperture in proportion to the last whorl, as viewed from the 

 front. The spire is longer and more slender than in S. salleana. 



At Lake Cuitseo, near Huingo, State of Michoacan, a much 

 smaller form was collected, in which the aperture is not so ample, 

 and less effuse below. Two specimens measure: 



Alt. 10.8, diam. 5.5, longest axis of aperture 8, greatest width 

 4.7 mm. 



Alt. 9.6, diam. 5.8, longest axis of aperture 7.7, greatest 

 width 4.3 mm. 



This may be called var. cuitseana. It has the same number of 

 whorls as the type. 

 Physa osculans rhyssa n. var. 



Smaller than typical P. osculans, pale yellow corneous, trans- 

 parent and fragile, with numerous slight longitudinal folds on the 

 last whorl. 



Saltillo, State of Coahuila, Mexico. 

 Sphaerium martensi n. sp. 



A moderately large, thin species, showing no distinct prodis- 

 soconch at the beaks; ovate, moderately convex, with median, 

 slightly prominent beaks, the surface lusterless, yellowish corneous, 

 finely and irregularly striated, nearly smooth toward the beaks; 

 anterior end narrower, symmetrically rounded ; posterior end wider, 

 obscurely truncated oblkpuely; hinge line slightly convex; basal 

 margin moderately convex. Interior whitish in clean shells; 

 hinge delicate, the left valve with a small, erect, compressed car-

dinal tooth, with a lower, very thin one above it and slightly more 

 posterior; anterior lateral short, erect, thin and triangular; pos- 

 terior lateral short and low. Right valve with two subequal, erect, 

 squarish cardinals, one behind the other, separated by a deep 

 V-shaped notch; laterals double, the anterior very short, the pos- 

 terior longer, low. 



Length 15.5, alt. 11, diam. 7.6 mm. 



Tzintzuntzan, Lake Patzcuaro, State of Michoacau, Mexico. 



This is a rather large species, more fragile than those of the 

 non-calvculate group in the United States. Compared with S. 

 subtransversum Prime, which has the same general outline, this 

 species differs in the broader beaks, which do not show the promi- 

 nent "caps" or prodissoconch of -S'. subtransversum; the cardinal 

 teeth are much thinner, more compressed, and the lateral laminae 

 are less elevated. It does not seem closely allied to any of the 

 American species I have been able to compare with it.

NEW SPECIES AND VARIETIES OF MOLLUSKS FROM MIAMI, FLORIDA. 



BY HEXRY A. PILSBRY. 



Bifidaria rhoadsi n. sp., figs. 1 aud 2. 



Shell rimate, very minute, cylindrical, blunt at the ends, espe- 

 cially above, glossy brown, somewhat translucent ; obliquely, deli- 

 cately striated. Whorls nearly five, the third and fourth extremely 

 convex, the last less so, somewhat compressed laterally behind the 



lip, marked there with 

 a slight furrow extend- 

 ing from the lip-edge 

 to about the position of 

 the upper palatal lam- 

 ella. Aperture round- 

 ed, truncate above, ob- 

 structed by five teeth 

 or lamellae : two upon 

 the parietal wall, one 

 slightly connected with 

 the right termination 

 Fig. i. Fig. 2. of the lip, the other 



more deeply placed ; columellar lamella strong, spirally enter- 

 ing, outer lip with two short lamella?. Peristome broadly ex- 

 panded, the outer lip somewhat incurved about the middle. Alt. 

 1.92, diam. 0.92 mm. 



Miami, Dade county, Florida. Collected by S. N. and M. C. 

 Rhoads, February, 1899. 



This very minute species is somewhat allied to certain forms of 

 Mexico. New Mexico and Arizona, remarkable for the partial or 

 complete separation of the two parietal lanielke, which in the ordi- 

 nary Bifidarice, such as contractu, rupicola or armifera, are united 

 to form a single bifid lamella. The disposition of the lamellae is 

 best shown by fig. 2, the shell being viewed obliquely from the 

 base. 



In this separation of the two parietal folds, B. rhoadsi some- 




404 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF L1899. 



what resembles B. ashmuni, B. da /liana and B. prototypus, but in 

 none but the first of these is the separation so complete. B. 

 ashmuni, however, has the folds stronger and the latter part of the 

 last whorl contracted as in B. contractu. B. dattiana is a whitish 

 species with the parietal folds distinctly united and a basal denticle 

 developed, while B. prototypus is a larger form, with smaller and 

 united parietal folds. 



In having the parietal folds quite separated, B. rhoadsi resembles 

 several east Asian representatives of Bifidaria, which are more 

 primitive than most of the American species. 



The figures are from camera lucida drawings. 

 S-trobilops hubbardi stevensoni n. var. 



Shell similar to S. hubbardi A. D. Brown, but darker, smoother, 

 more widely umbilicated and constantly with three lamella? within 

 the basal wall. 



Dark reddish chestnut, very glossy ; sculptured with very fine 

 stria? above, the base smoother with microscopic spirals. Whorls 

 4, quite convex, the last well rounded at the periphery which is 

 above the middle; umbilicus wide, the latter third of the last 

 whorl deviating tangentially, somewhat as in many Polygyras. 

 Through the base at the last fourth of the body- whorl may be seen 

 three lamellre, the outermost below the periphery, rather long, and 

 somewhat oblique; the others shorter. Parietal wall showing one 

 strong, emerging lamella above, and a much weaker cue below 

 (the latter emerging only in fully mature shells), both of them 

 running inward about one-third of a whorl. Aperture broadly 

 lunate-oval, oblique, with whitish, expanded and subreflexed lip. 



Miami, Florida. 



This form differs from *S'. hubbardi chiefly in its wider umbilicus 

 and smoother surface, though the darker color and smaller number 

 of lamellae visible through the base are further distinguishing 

 features. Mr. Webster [Nautilus, vii, pp. 84, 94) has shown 

 hubbardi to vary in the number of lamelhe. At Mr. Rhoad's re- 

 quest, it is named in honor of Mr. James Stevenson, an energetic 

 naturalist of Miami, Florida. 

 Glandina truncata minor, n. var. 



Similar to the typical form, but constantly much smaller.

Very large series collected by Mr. Rhoads as well as the speci- 

 mens taken by myself are constantly far smaller than the typical 

 form, although they occur in a region where the country rock is 

 limestone. I found only the typical G. truncata at Palm Beach. 

 The small variety seems to be confined to the calcareous region 

 in the extreme South.

BY WILLIAM J. FOX. 



The present paper, the seventh of the series dealing with Mr. 

 H. H. Smith's collections, relates to the solitary wasps, and is 

 presented in incomplete form in consequence of the want of 

 available time for entomological work on the part of the writer. 

 These pages were written almost a year ago, and laid by with the 

 hope of soon working out the material of the genus Odynerus 

 thereby completing the Eumenidse of the collection, which hope, 

 however, has not been realized, beyond the drawing up of several 

 descriptions of new species which will be included in a separate 

 paper on that genus. 



A. Pedicel of second segment shorter than width of first seg- 

 ment at apex, 

 a. Postscutellum entire.

There is a remarkably abnormal specimen of this species in the 

 collection. It is a d\ and has the petiole produced into two long 

 acute spine3 on the ventral surface laterally, that on the right 

 side placed some distance in advance of the other, The occiput 

 is emarginate medially, and that portion of the front filling the

emargination of eye is pushed out, distorting the eye, so that when 

 viewed from the side it appears to be sharply angulate, or subden- 

 tate on its inner margin. 



Zethus prominens n. sp. 



Black, shining; middle segment, petiole, base of second seg- 

 ment, legs, clypeus except base, mandibles and scape beneath, red ;

 lar at sides, with shallow punctures, fore margin broadly incurved, 

 obtusely dentate medially ; mandibles long, equalling the width of 

 clypeus in length ; front and vertex with tolerably strong, but 

 not deep, scattered punctures, becoming obsolete on cheeks 

 posteriorly ; space between hind ocelli slightly less than that be- 

 tween them and eyes; first joint of flagellum fully as long as two 

 following united; pronotum with a strong tooth on each side, and 

 sharply margined anteriorly; dorsulum sparsely punctured, with 

 an impressed line anteriorly in the middle, on each side of which

 are two parallel strong impressions, with a feebler longer one on 

 each side; scutellum flat, scarcely impressed ; postscutellum sub- 

 convex, entire; middle segment concave medially, the lateral surface 

 separated from the upper and posterior by a sharp ridge, running 

 from base to apex ; enlarged portion of petiole with sparse punctures, 

 broadest and rounder at base, the sides gradually converging to 

 apex, not rounded, the slender basal portion not as long as hind 

 coxre; second segment with a short, thick pedicel wdiose length 

 does not equal the width of petiole at apex, microscopically punc- 

 tured above, the ventral moiety with large punctures, very sparse 

 toward base; dorsals 3-6 rather compactly punctured, ventrals 

 3-6 with strong, separated punctures; second submarginal with a 

 distinct radial side, which is, however, a little less than the dis- 

 tance between the recurrent nervures on the cubital nervure. 

 Length 28-29 mm. 



Chapada, March, April. Four specimens. In coloration this spe- 

 cies resembles recurvirostris, but it is quite distinct. The straight, 

 not rounded or convex , sides of petiole and sharp lateral carina of 

 middle segment are salient features of this insect.

 and their d abdomen is provided with leaf-like appendages beneath. 



Zethus chalybeus Sauss. 



Chapada, April; Santarem. Four $ specimens. 



Zethus sessilis n. sp. 



Black; abdomen with a grayish pile; mandibles medially, spot 

 on tegular, legs more or less, and sides of petiole dark reddish or 

 reddish brown; wings fuscous as far as stigma, darkest in costal

Chapada, March and February. Eight ? and one cf speci- 

 mens. Seems to resemble Z. rufinodus in coloration, but judging 

 from the figure of that species given by Saussure (PI. vi, f. 3, 

 Vespides, iii), the petiole is of an entirely different shape. 



Zethus pallidus Sm. 



Santarem. One example. This species has the postscutellum 

 strongly bidentate, almost bispinose and the dorsulum has two 

 smooth raised lines; the petiole campanulate. The entire insect is

 carina a short distance upon the sides, which are otherwise quite 

 smooth: petiole with stem long, nearly as long as first hind tarsal

 strong; stem of petiole shorter and thicker, carina obscure, the 

 enlarged portion more robust and coarsely punctured. Length

 c? specimens. The strongly produced pronotal angles, rugosity of 

 head, and carinated petiole are peculiarities of this species. 

 Zethus thoracicus n. sp.

 ling hind coxa and trochanter in length, the enlarged portion of 

 petiole broadly ovate, widest toward base, finely punctured medially

 L r mal cell slightly greater than the distance between the first trans- 

 verso-cubital and the first recurrent nervures on the cubital 

 nervure; third submarginal cell somewhat rhomboidal, the outer 

 nervure sinuous. Length 12^ mm. 



Chapada. One specimen. In coloration this species is quite simi- 

 lar to Z. miniatus, but it is not closely related to that insect. The 

 peculiarly shaped accessory membrane of third dorsal segment is 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 421 



similar to that described and figured by de Saussure as occurring 

 on the second segment of Z. Igbulatus; and the coloration of Z. 

 thoracicus and lobulatus seems to be very similar. But the fa,ct 

 that lobulatus has the pronotuin spiuose laterally, and with a short, 

 coarsely punctured thorax, shows that they are not closely related. 

 In the length of thorax, Z. thoracicus differs from all the other 

 species in the present collection. 

 Zethus ferrugineus Sauss. 



Four specimens from Santarem. These specimens differ from the 

 description in some points of coloration, and as no structural 

 characters whatever are given by de Saussure, I am not certain 

 that these specimens really represent Z. ferrugineus. 

 Zethus chrysopterus Sauss. 



A single specimen from Santarem. Z. sculpturalis Smith is 

 probably identical with this species.

 mogastra.

 be united is worthy of further thought. In fact it is difficult to 

 understand why Elimus and Labas should be considered distinct 

 from Zethus.

436 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



ZETHOIDES gen. nov. 

 Allied to Zethus which it greatly resemhles superficially, and 

 seems to differ only in the following points: Middle tibiae one- 

 spurred ; labrum broadly truncate ; mandibles elongate, with four 

 large teeth reaching from apex half way to base on inner margin. 

 In the only species known, the clypeus is armed with two large 

 prongs, between which it is broadly incurved, and all the tarsi are 

 flattened and short ; but these are probably sexual characteristics. 

 Female unknown. 



In the shape of mandibles this genus would fall in Saussure's 

 " Legion II. The Odynerites," 2 while the shape of abdomen, with 

 its pedicellated second segment indicates its affinities with 

 " Legion I. The Zethites. " As it stands, Zethoides must be con- 

 sidered a connecting link between these two Legions. The 

 palpi agree with those of Zethus in the number of joints, those of 

 the labial palpi in length are as follows: the first longest, the 

 second shorter, but longer than the two following united, the last 

 smallest, quite minute. 



Zethoides Smithii n. sp.

 Saussure. 

 Montezumia analis Sauss. 



Two specimens. Santarem. 

 Montezumia Spinolae Sauss. 



Numerous examples from various localities. 



Montezumia sparsa n. sp. 



$. — Black; mandibles, margin of teguke, middle segment, post- 

 scutellum sometimes (more rarely both scutella), metapleurse, 

 mesopleurse beneath, legs except part of coxre, and first abdominal 

 segment ferruginous; wings blue-black; two dots on postscutellum 

 and line at apex of first segment, yellow; clypeus with sparse, 

 shallow, punctures, its fore margin broadly incurved, subdentate 

 laterally ; pronotum scarcely margined, with deep, confluent though 

 not close, punctures; dorsulura with punctures well separated, with 

 a narrow, smooth line anteriorly in middle; middle segment more 

 broadly, therefore less deeply, depressed than in Spinolaz; first 

 abdominal segment a little narrower, more rounded at sides, less 

 pilose ; second dorsal with sparse shallow punctures medially, the 

 second ventral shining with much larger, sparse punctures. Length 

 19-22 mm. 



Chapada, March. Six specimens. I had at first considered 

 these as a mere variety of M. Spinoke, but the differences in sculp- 

 ture of thorax and abdomen, as well as the different coloration of 

 the former, induced me to describe it as distinct. The clypeal teeth 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 463 



are much more distinct than in Spinolce, and the clypeus seems 



longer. 



Montezumia ferruginea Sanaa. 



Corumba, February, April; Pedra Branca, April. Four speci- 

 mens. These represent the entirely ferruginous form mentioned 

 by Saussure. In one example the abdomen, except first segment, 

 tends to brownish or subfuscous. 



Montezumia anceps Sauss. 



Rio de Janeiro, November; Uacarizal, February. Two speci- 

 mens probably represent this species. 



Montezumia macrocephala Sauss. 



Fifteen males, eight females. Chapada, March, April, October. 



Montezumia earinulata (Spin.) Sauss. has maxillary palpi six-, 

 the labial palpi four-jointed. I have therefore transferred it to 

 Nortonia. 



Monobia angulosa Sauss. 

 Numerous specimens. 



Monobia funebris Grib. 



Four specimens. Corumba and Mararii, April; Santarem. I 

 am inclined to regard this as a variety of M. apicalipennis Sauss. 



Monobia curvata n. sp. 



5. — Black; head except part of front, scape, pedicel and base 

 of first flagellum joint, thorax above almost entirely including the 

 upper portions of meso- and metapleura?, fore legs except base, the 

 medial and hind femora and tibiae in front, rufous; the dorsulum 

 and scutella are more or less blackish, sometimes these parts are 

 entirely black; inner orbits beneath and spot at base of mandibles, 

 yellow; wings blue-black, with a narrow pale apical margin; cly- 

 peus subpyriform, with large rather shallow punctures, its fore 

 margin subtruncate, subdentate laterally; front coarsely punc- 

 tured; space between hind ocelli ecpial to or slightly less than that 

 between them and eyes; thorax with tolerably deep, close punc- 

 tures, more separated on dorsulum ; middle segment above with 

 much larger punctures, the concave area smooth, sides roughly 

 angulate or subdentate, but not spinose; dorsal surface of abdo- 

 men with fine, close punctures, those on second segment sparse

medially, the ventral surface with larger, shallow, separated punc- 

 tures. Length 16-17 mm. 



d\ — Colored like female but more coarsely sculptured; clypeus 

 shorter, finely punctured, and in addition with a few shallow 

 punctures, its fore margin more incurved ; flagelluni rufous api- 

 cally; space between hind ocelli slightly greater than that between 

 them and eyes; first joint of median tarsi stout, curved, clothed 

 with pale hairs within, not much, if anything, longer than half 

 its tibia. 



Chapada, March, November. Five females, two males. Seems 

 to be close to M. anomala Sauss. There is quite a distinction be- 

 tween the males of this species and angulosa Sauss., in the shape 

 of the first joint of middle tarsi. 



Nortonia carinulata Spin. (= Montezumia carinulata (Spin.) Sauss.). 



One specimen. Chapada, November. In the six-jointed max- 

 illary -, and four-jointed labial palpi, this insect differs from 

 Montezumia, in which genus de Saussure placed it, founding there- 

 for the division Paramimia, which name will probably take prece- 

 dence over Nortonia. which was not described until twenty-five 

 years later.

THE SUMMER MOLTING PLUMAGE OF CERTAIN DUCKS. 

 BY WITMER STONE. 



Of all our ducks I believe there is but one, the Old Squaw, in 

 which the adult male has a distinct nuptial and winter plumage. 



That is to say the old males of all our other ducks remain in the 

 same plumage from the time they arrive in the autumn until their 

 departure northward in spring. 



Judging by what occurs in other birds we should say since 

 these ducks show no tendency toward a change of plumage when 

 they leave us in spring, that they must retain the same feathers 

 that covered them during the winter, until the end of the breeding 

 season, when a complete molt occurs and a new dress exactly like 

 the one just shed, is assumed. In other words the plumage re- 

 mains the same at all seasons, except for such changes as are 

 effected by wear, tear and bleaching, and there is one annual molt 

 at the close of the breeding season. 



That this is not the case, however, has long been known, and a 

 peculiar summer plumage of the adult males of several of our 

 ducks has been described. 



This has been variously termed " summer plumage," " molting 

 plumage," " plumage after the breeding season," etc., but its 

 true character seems not to be generally understood. 



The first record of this peculiar summer plumage of male ducks, 

 with which I am acquainted, occurs in the supplement to Mon- 

 tagu's Ornithological Dictionary, 1813, under head of the Pintail 

 (Dajila acuta). 



He here describes the molting of some domesticated individuals 

 and states : " In the month of June or beginning of July these 

 birds commenced their change of plumage, and by degrees after 

 making a singular, mottled appearance, especially on the part of 

 the body which was white before, became by the first week in 

 August, entirely of a brown color. The beautiful bronze on the 

 head, the white streak on each side of the neck, and all the white

beneath, as well as the elegant scapulars had entirely vanished, 

 and to all appearance a sexual melamorphosis had taken place. 

 But this change was of short duration, for about the latter end of 

 September one of the males began to reassume the masculiue attire 

 .... and by the middle of October this bird was again in full 

 plumage." 



In 1838, Waterton 1 described a similar molt iu the male Mal- 

 lard, and later on many other species were found to have the same 

 habit of moltiug, so that in Ridgway's Manual we find the follow- 

 ing species given, largely on the authority of Dresser, as having a 

 peculiar summer plumage resembling the female: — Mallard, Blue- 

 Wing and Cinnamon Teal, Gadwall, Widgeon, Pintail and Scaup. 

 Additional species are mentioned iu the British Museum catalogue. 



Notwithstanding this, however, only a few of the above are men- 

 tioned in Elliot's Wild Fowl as having a peculiar summer plumage, 

 and other works have ignored the question entirely. 



A study of the magnificent collection of arctic birds made by 

 Mr. E. A. Mcllheuny, at Point Barrow, has shown conclusively 

 that the various Eider ducks, the Pacific, Spectacled, King, and 

 Steller's Eiders all assume a peculiar summer plumage, and further 

 investigation adds the Red-breasted Merganser to the number. 



With all these facts before us it seems not unreasonable to pre- 

 dict that in all ducks where the plumages of the male and female 

 are markedly different we may expect to find this double molt and 

 dull summer plumage in the male. So unexpected are some of the 

 laws governing molts, however, that there may be exceptions. 



As regards the reason for this double molt, Montagu Avas unable 

 to furnish any explanation. He says : " The double molting in 

 so short a time, peculiar to some species of birds, is a most curious 

 .and extraordinary circumstance that seems to bid defiance to- all 

 human reasoning. That some birds change their plumage with 

 ihe season is evidently a gift of nature to accommodate their color to 

 their habits, as in the Ptarmigan, which changes his mottled plum- 

 age in the autumn for that of white, in order that he may rest se- 

 cure upon the bosom of the snow during winter. But there is no 

 such evident reason for a double change in the short space of two 

 <or three months in the same season."

1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 469 



An examination of Mr. Mcllhenny's series of Eiders sheds a 

 great deal of light upon this subject. 



In the first place this summer plumage is in no sense a nuptial 

 plumage ; while it may begin to appear before the young birds are 

 hatched it does not appear until the mating season is over and is 

 distinctly a post-nuptial dress. It is mainly restricted to the head, 

 neck, breast and scapulars, as already pointed out by Montagu ; 

 that is, to those parts which are most conspicuously colored. 



The most important point in connection with this summer 

 plumage is that the annual molt of the flight feathers does not 

 begin until this dull plumage has been fully acquired, and as soon 

 as the new flight feathers have become functional the dull plumage 

 as well as the rest of the old plumage is lost and the annual n.olt 

 of the body feathers progresses normally. 



It will thus be seen that this dull plumage lasts only during the 

 period when the bird is unable .to fly, for, as is generally known, 

 ducks molt their flight feathers all at once and temporarily lose 

 the power of flight. 



At such a time a dull blended plumage would naturally be impor- 

 tant in rendering the bird inconspicuous and thereby protecting it, 

 and such I think is the explanation of this curious summer molt. 



Of the various names that have been suggested for it, " sum- 

 mer molting plumage " seems the best, as it is different in charac- 

 ter from any plumage known among other birds, and, as has been 

 already shown, has nothing to do with the nuptial season, but is 

 entirely related to the annual molt. 



I may further state that the feathers of this plumage are very 

 poor and loosely constructed, like those of the " post-nidal " or 

 " first " plumage of young birds, which is also a mere temporary 

 summer dress. 



In connection with the summer molting plumage of the Eiders it 

 is interesting to note that Dresser, in his Birds of Europe, gives an 

 excellent description of this plumage in the King Eider, but 

 regards it as the " young male." In the same article he quotes 

 from Mr. G. Gillett,- who saw several of these birds in Matthew's 

 Strait, August 6, " all apparently immature males," though two 

 specimens that were shot were found to be " entirely destitute of 



*Ibis., 1830, p. 309.- 




470 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



quill feathers, so that they could not fly." Mr. L. Lloyd in Game 

 Birds and Wild Fowl of Norway states also "that the old male of the 

 common Eider loses his brilliant dress toward autumn and becomes 

 in a great part black," but neither he nor Mr. Dresser seem to 

 have understood the significance of these changes. 



I can hardly realize that the question has not been satisfactorily 

 explained heretofore, but a somewhat extended research has so far 

 failed to discover such explanation and I have therefore prepared 

 an outline of this peculiar molt. 



Descriptions of the molting plumages of the several Eider 

 ducks found in Alaska are appended, taken from specimens in the 

 collection of Mr. Mcllhenny, to whom I am under obligation for 

 allowing me to make use of this material, and to whose energy and 

 perseverance science is indebted for one of the finest collections of 

 Arctic birds yet obtained. 



Somateria spectabilis (Linn). King Eider. 



Breeding males up to June 1, are in full nuptial plumage. The 

 next specimens obtained were on August 24 and 30, and these 

 illustrate the change to the molting plumage. The breast is 

 speckled all over with new brown, white and black barred or 

 mottled feathers, the interscapulum is largely speckled with black 

 and the head and neck are being covered with dull brown feathers 

 with black tips. The pattern of the green and pale bluish areas 

 on the head as well as the black V on the throat are still clearly 

 apparent, though they are being rapidly replaced by dull brown 

 feathers and the bright plumage that remains is but lightly at- 

 tached and easily dislodged. 



Another specimen taken August 24, but further advanced, has 

 lost all trace of the bright plumage and is dull colored all over the 

 head, neck and breast. In none of these are the flight feathers 

 molted though they are exceedingly worn and bleached. 



Somateria v-nigra (Gray). Pacific Eider. 



The series of this species includes males in nuptial plumage up 

 to June 3, after which none were secured until August 20. This 

 specimen is a little more advanced than the first King Eiders 

 described above; the dull molting plumage is nearly complete but 

 traces of the bright feathering of the head remain; the old worn 

 flight feathers have not been shed. The next specimens taken 




1899.] NATURAL SCTENXES OF PHILADELPHIA. 471 



September 17 (1) and September 23 (5) are in full molting 

 plumage : belly and wings as in nuptial dress, head and neck dull 

 brown, streaked with black, and with indistinct lighter areas on 

 the head; breast mottled, feathers generally white in the centre, 

 black at the tip and barred with brown ; some are all brown and 

 some all white, scapulars blackish or brownish varied with white. 

 In all six specimens the flight feathers bave been molted and the 

 new ones are about half grown. The last specimen of this inter- 

 esting series was taken October 6 ; it shows a full grown set of new 

 flight feathers while the new winter plumage is supplanting the 

 temporary molting plumage and the remains of the nuptial dress. 



The breast plumage is almost completely renewed but is still 

 flecked with brownish feathers, while the new green feathers of the 

 head may be seen just bursting from the pin-feather sheaths, though 

 still concealed by the brown feathers of the molting plumage. 

 Arctonetta fischeri ' Brandt). Spectacled Eider. 



Males in nuptial plumage were obtained as late as July 27, 

 while one specimen, taken September 17, represents the molting 

 plumage. No similar bird has, I believe, ever been described. 



The new flight feathers are nearly full grown; the head and 

 neck are gray, streaked with black, front antl cheeks whitish, eye 

 area gray, centre of throat white, more or less brown, barred 

 feathers on the breast, back and scapulars largely gray. 

 Eniconetta stelleri (Pall). Steller's Duck. 



Adult males in nuptial plumage were secured by Mr. Mcllhenny 

 up to July 2, but none after that date. Fortunately a specimen 

 secured by Dr. Benj. Sharp, at St. Lawrence Island, July 24, 

 1895, No. 34,520, Coll. Acad. Xat. Sci., supplies the desired 

 plumage for this species. It is as follows : 



Belly, back and wings as in the nuptial plumage, entire head and 

 neck dull brown, with a few of the green and white feathers still 

 unshed, plumage of breast very ragged in appearance with new 

 brownish feathers everywhere replacing those of the nuptial dress. 



As would be supposed from the condition of the plumage the 

 flight feathers have not yet been shed. 

 Merganser serrator t'L). Red-breasted Merganser. 



Two males secured July 27 at Pt. Barrow are acquiring the 

 molting plumage, the first instance I have seen of the existence of 

 this plumage among the Mergansers. 




472 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



They resemble the nuptial plumage, except the head, neck and 

 breast, exactly as in the Eiders. The neck is like that of the 

 female, but browner, head and crest dull brown, the breast is 

 becoming dull gray. Many of the black feathers of the head 

 and pink and black feathers of the breast still remain from the 

 nuptial plumage, but they are very easily brushed loose. The 

 flight feathers have not yet been molted.

front; the latter half of the base becoming greatly swollen, the 

 umbilicus passing into a large excavated area behind the columellar 

 lip. Aperture very oblique, squarish oblong, white within ; peris- 

 tome well expanded, the upper and baso-columellar margins 

 straightened and subparallel, the latter reflexed, dilated and quite 

 vaulted over the umbilicus at the insertion; parietal callus bluish 

 white, strong. 



Alt. 48; greater diam. 51, lesser 45 mm. 



A single specimen was found in a collection obtained by Mr. 

 Walter F. Webb, of Albion, N. Y. , in whose honor the species is 

 named. It bore the label " Helix, Solomon Is. ;" but I regard 

 this locality as open to grave suspicion. It is probably from 

 northern Queensland, though one would scarcely expect a new 

 Helix over two inches in diameter from that region, after the labors 

 of Dr. Cox, Messrs. Brazier, Hedley and others in the elucidation 

 of the Queensland fauna. 



T. Webbi belongs between the Hadra section of Thersites and 

 the typical group of the genus, but is nearer the former. It 

 resembles T. bipartite in the bicolored shell substance, readily seen 

 by looking in the aperture with the shell held toward a light, in 

 the structure and color of the lip, and the form of the latter part 

 of the base of the shell and the umbilicus. It differs from T. 

 bipartita in the strong peripheral keel, flat whorls of the dome- 

 shaped instead of conic spire, the greater anterior deflection of the 

 last whorl, the less rotund aperture and the darker color of the 

 cuticle above. T. Webbi resembles Thersites richmondiana in being 

 keeled, and in the flatness of the whorls of the spire, separated by 

 merely linear sutures; but it differs in other particulars of form, 

 color, etc., so much that a comparison is needless.

NOTES ON CHILEAN FISHES. WITH DESCRIPTION OF A NEW 

 SPECIES OF SEBASTODES. 



BY JAMES FRANCIS ABBOTT. 



Iu the spring of 1897, Rear Admiral L. A. Beardslee, U. S. N., 

 then in command of the U. S. man-of-war " Philadelphia," 

 secured in the harbor of Valparaiso, Chile, a small collection of 

 fishes which he presented to the museum of Leland Stanford Junior 

 University. Through the courtesy of Dr. C. H. Gilbert, the 

 writer was offered the opportunity of examining them. The 

 following species were noted : 



1. Potamalosa notacanthoides (Steindachner). 



2. Clupanodon Jimbriatus (Kner and Steindachner). 



3. Isacia concept ion is (Cuv. and Yal. ). 



4. Genypterus chilensis (Gay). 



5. Prolatilus jugular is (Cuv. and Yal. ). 



6. Hippoglossinn macrops Steindachner. 



The last-mentioned species has heretofore been known only from 

 Steindachner' s original description and excellent plate and from 

 Giinther's single allusion unaccompanied by description. The 

 specimen at hand agrees with the description of H. macrops so 

 exactly in every detail as to leave no doubt whatever of its iden- 

 tity. But the extension of the range of the species through such 

 a very great distance as that from Mazatlan to the Strait of 

 Magellan is hardly probable, and it is more than likely that the 

 fish described by Steindachner did not come from Mazatlan at all, 

 but from far down the South American coast. This idea will be 

 accepted the more readily when we recall the remarkable jumble of 

 species attributed to the fauna of Mazatlan by the same author, 1 the 

 result of a collector's transposition of labels, and later corrected 

 by him. We may also consider the fact that in all the extensive 

 collecting that has been done on the Mexican and Central Ameri- 

 can coast in recent years, no specimen of this well-marked species 

 has been found. 



1 Ichthyologiscfie Xotizen, ix. 




476 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



The single specimen we have examined is noteworthy in that it 

 is dextral, while the type specimen is sinistral. Probably the 

 species is indifferently one or the other. The gillrakers are short, 

 6 + 11. The antrorse preanal spine is well developed. 



The species is readily separated from Hipjpoglossina slomata by 

 the much larger mouth of the latter. It differs from H. bollmanni, 

 its nearest relative, in the somewhat greater number of dorsal and 

 anal rays, and especially in the number of gillrakers, which are 

 3 + 9 in that species. The interorbital ridge is continued upon the 

 side of the head in the type of bollmanni, so as to form a doubly 

 curved lateral ridge; in maerops the interorbital ridge is natter and 

 fades away at the border of the upper orbit.

 1881. Trinidad Channel [Strait of Magellan]. 



Sebastodes jenynsi Abbott, new species. 



This species belongs to the rosaceus group, and resembles very 

 closely its East Pacific relatives, Sebastodes oculatus and 8. dar- 

 ivini. It is easily distinguished from 8. rosaceus by the much 

 larger eye of the latter as well as by its lower spinous dorsal and 

 slightly greater depth. From oculatus it is separated especially 

 by its considerably greater depth and fewer anal rays, and from 

 darwini by its longer pectoral and much shorter second anal spine. 

 The arrangement of the four spots of color also differs markedly 

 from that in the other species sharing this character, rosaceus, con- 

 stellatus, rhodochloris, chlorostictus and oculatus. 



Mr. Cramer 2 remarks that in view of the fact that fifty species 

 of the genus are known to inhabit the north temperate waters of 

 Pacific North America, it is not improbable that the species will be 

 found equally numerous on the temperate South American coast. 

 Heretofore but two species have been described from this region, 

 although Jenyns mentions the drawing of another in the possession 

 of Darwin with the spinous development less marked and ap- 

 proaching in some of its characters 8. ciliatus (#. variabilis Cuv. 

 and Val. ) . This may or may not be the same as the specimen in 

 hand, but ours has little affinity with ciliatus.

head. D. XIII, 13 ; A. Ill, 6. Pores in lateral line 45. Body 

 as in Sebastodes rosaceu-s, perhaps a trifle heavier in appearance, 

 head somewhat blunter. Jaws subequal, the lower with a small 

 knob. Maxillary 2 in head, reaching past middle of pupil. Gill- 

 rakers thin, 2^ in eye, 7 + 22 in number, the last seven on lower 

 arch much reduced. Nasal, preocular, supraocular, postocular. 

 tympanic, and parietal spines present. The entire spinous develop- 

 ment is somewhat heavier than in rosaceus, but the spiDes are 

 blunter and a trifle lower. Interorbital f of eye, with two parallel 

 ridges as in that species, but these are a little lower and the groove 

 between is somewhat shallower. Preopercle with five rather broad 

 and fiat spines, the two upper being the strongest. Opercle with 

 two similar ones. Scapular and suprascapular spines present, but 

 not prominent. 



Head finely scaled above, up to nasal spines. Snout sparsely 

 scaled, with exception of the region bounded by the nasal spines. 

 A few scales on maxillary; inaudible naked. Dorsal consider- 

 ably lower than in rosaceus, fourth spine 3^- in head (2|- in rosa-

 anal. spine heavy, barely exceeding third spine, 2i in head; first 

 anal ray 2 in head. Pectoral reaches past ventrals, almost to first 

 spine of anal. Ventral If in head. 



Coloration (in alcohol) dark, marbled and mottled above lateral 

 line, pectorals bluish (probably deep blue in life). Dorsal very 

 dark ; ventrals dark. Four radiating dark bands on side of head. 

 A dark streak down middle of maxillary. Four pale spots as in 

 related species ; one under last ray of dorsal, one under last spine, 

 one on lateral line under ninth spine, and one just under the fin 

 under eighth spine — this last differing in position from the corre- 

 sponding mark in other species. Branchiostegal membrane bluish, 

 traces of salmon pink under jaws.

 tints largely replaced by white. The lower surface is white with 

 a slight buff suffusion in some examples, while the dark stripes on 

 the breast average narrower than in more southern specimens. 

 The females are slightly darker than the males. 



In measurements they agree pretty well with examples from the 

 United States, the wing of eight males ranging from 11.75 to 

 12.25 ins. (average 11.95 ins.) and of three females from 12 to 

 12.30 ins. (average 12.15 ins. ). 



Notwithstanding the individual variations exhibited by this 

 genus, Mr. Stone regarded these Pt. Barrow specimens as repre- 

 senting a distinct geographic race, probably ranging southeastward 

 over the arctic barren grounds, and proposed to separate it as Asio 

 accipitrinus McIIhennyi (Type 958 Coll. E. A. Mcllhenny, Pt.

DESCRIPTION OF AMEIURUS LACUSTRIS OKEECHOBEENSIS. 

 BY HENRY W. FOWLER. 



Ameiurus lacustris okeechobeensis (Heilpriu). 



Ietalurus okeecliobeensis Heilprin, Trans. Wagner Inst. Sci. Phila., I, 

 1887, pi. 18 ; Kissimee River, Lake Okeechobee, Florida. 



Ameiurus okeechobeensis Jordan and Everniaun, Bull. U. S. Nat. 

 Mus., No. 47, I, 1896, p. 138. 



This fish, which was first described by Prof. Heilprin, proves 

 to be a subspecies of Ameiurus lacustris (Walb. ), and as his de- 

 scription is insufficient I redescribe it. 



Form of the body rather elongate. Head 3i in the body. D. 

 I, 6. Eye 9h in head and situated anterior to the middle of the 

 head and with the lower margin of the orbit on a line with the 

 middle of the depth of the head. Head, convex posteriorly, its 

 width between the opercles ly 3 ^ in its length and 4i in the body. 

 The supraoccipital process reaches the second interspinal and the 

 ridge of bone is thus complete. Interorbital space more or less 

 shallowly convex, the eye being contained in it 5§ times. Mouth 

 rather large, lips fleshy. Barbels thin, especially the nasal pair 

 and the outstretched maxillary pair reach f the length of the P. 

 spine. Inner margin of the P. spine serrate. The D. spine is 

 smooth and nearly 2^ in the length of the head. Humeral process 

 covered with thin skin, and only is it slightly rugose on the ante- 

 rior portion, and it projects backward and slightly upward for 

 more than one-half the length of the P. spine. The V. reach 

 the A. The A. fin with 24 rays, and its base 4J in the length of 

 the body. The insertion of the D. is at a point a little behind 

 the tip of the outstretched P., and nearer the adipose fin than the 

 tip of the snout. Lateral line slightly arched anteriorly. Caudal 

 forked, the upper lobe longer than the lower, and with the rudi- 

 mentary rays conspicuous. Color above blackish brown, the D., 

 the A., and caudal fins of the same color. Upper surface of the 

 P. and V. blackish brown. Lower surface of the body whitish. 

 Barbels blackish brown, except the median mental pair, which are 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 481 



whitish like the lips. There are two specimens of this fish in the 

 collection. The type, No. 8,443, from which the above description 

 was taken, is larger than the other, which is No. 8,442, measuring 

 21 and 14 inches respectively. They both possess 26 ravs in the 

 A. fin if the anterior rudiments are counted and have the D. 

 situated nearer the tip of the adipose fin than the tip of the snout. 

 These specimens were collected in 1886, and presented to the 

 Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia by Prof. Angelo 

 Heilprin.

OBSERVATIONS ON FISHES FROM THE CAROLINE ISLANDS. 

 BY HENRY' W. FOWLER. 



Among the presentations made to the Academy of Natural 

 Sciences of Philadelphia by the late Prof. E. D. Cope was a col- 

 lection of marine Fishes, comprising forty-five specimens, from the 

 Caroline Islands. Most of these specimens are in a fair state of 

 preservation. They have been made into dry preparations or 

 skins, some of them being only one-half of the skin of the orig- 

 inal specimen, but most of them are entire, the bodies having 

 been filled out and varnished on the outside. It is unfortunate 

 that the data are very meagre, no precise localities being given. 



EXOCOETID^. 

 1. Cypsilurus quindecimradiatus sp. nov. Plate XVII. 



The form of the body is elongate and spindle-shaped. Head 

 flat and broad above, compressed laterally so that the lower surface 

 is rounded, 4^ in the body without the caudal. Eye 3i in head 

 and about \\ in the interorbital space, which is level, the orbits 

 being placed in the upper anterior part of the head and with their 

 lower margins below the lower jaw. The eye is also contained 

 li in the space between its posterior margin and that of the 

 operculum. The length of the snout, from the tip of the upper 

 jaw, li in the eye. The mouth terminal, superior, the lower jaw 

 projecting, and with the cleft inclined moderately. The posterior 

 margin of the eye is nearer the origin of the P. than the tip of the 

 upper jaw. Teeth minute. Branchial aperture large. Opercles 

 large, scaled. The greatest depth of the body, which falls consider- 

 ably short of the length of the head, is contained in the total length 

 of the body about six times. The origin of the P. is situated on a 

 level with the pupil of the eye, the radii of the fin about 14, the first 

 and second somewhat enlarged and the third and fourth the long- 

 est ; of the former, which are simple, the second is bifid for the ter- 

 minal half or more, while the rest of these rays are all branched. 

 The outstretched P. probably reached backward to the eleventh 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 483 



or twelfth D. ray or at least as far as the tip of the V. Origin of 

 the V. about midway between the origin of the P. and the first 

 rudimentary rays of the caudal. Rays of V. 6 , the third the 

 longest, tip of the fin extending beyond (he origin of the A. 

 Origin of the D. inserted nearly equidistant to the origin of the 

 V. and A., and also equidistant to the origins of the P. and the 

 tip of the upper lobe of the caudal. D. with 15 rays, the poste- 

 rior of which do not reach near the rudimentary caudal rays. 

 Base of the D. no! as long as the head and the base of the A. not 

 as long as the base of the D. Caudal deeply forked, the lower 

 lobe greatly exceeding the upper in length and contained in it 

 If times. The lateral line runs very low along the lower part of 

 the sides of the body and passes near the origin of the V. Rudi- 

 mentary rays of the lower lobe of the caudal much more robust 

 than those of the upper lobe and about 7 in number. The caudal 

 is much compressed and flattened laterally, the rays being strong 

 and giving great solidity and power to this steering instrument. 

 Total length of the specimen 17f inches. No. 23,27-"). 



HOL.OCENTRIDJE. 

 2. Holocentrus spinifer (Forskal). 



Scimna spinifera Forskal, Descript. Animal., 1775, p. 49. 

 Body compressed, with the anterior dorsal region elevated. 

 Scales 48, about 43 pores. D. xi, 15. A. iv, 10. P. i, 14. V. 

 i, 7. Head about 3^ in length, with caudal which is not quite 5. 

 The greatest depth of the body about equal to the length of the 

 head. Interorbital space very narrow, not as wide as the maxilla 

 with its supplemental bone. The upper profile line of the head is 

 nearly straight from the tip of the snout to the occiput and froru 

 this point to the origin of the D. convex, at which latter point 

 the body assumes its greatest depth. There are five rows of scales 

 on the cheeks, the row bordering the eye being the largest. The 

 eye is contained more than 3f times in the head, and is equal to 

 the snout in length. The prajopercular spine is more than one-half 

 the length of the posterior margin of the prseoperculum and a, 

 trifle larger than the diameter of the eye. The serrations or 

 spines of the prseoperculum are much larger than those of the oper- 

 culum. There are 2 spines at the posterior angle of the opercu- 

 lum, th% upper of which is the largest, and the sharpest. The 




484 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



opercles are evenly striated, the striations forming small serrations 

 on the posterior margin. The interoperculum has 4 or 5 tooth- 

 like serratures on its posterior margin. The suboperculnm is 

 nearly smooth, the striations being indistinct, though there are 

 several feeble serrations along the upper and lower portions of 

 the posterior edge. There is a very narrow bony border around 

 the eye which has its outer edge finely serrate. There are 6 praeor- 

 bital spines, the outer of which are much larger than the 4 central 

 ones, situated along the lower edges of the prseorbital bones, they 

 all point downward. The superior cranial bones are strongly 

 radiated. The maxillary extends to the anterior margin of the 

 pupil of the eye. Supplemental maxillary large. The eye is 

 placed above and somewhat anterior to the centre of the head. 

 Teeth all minute. The distance between the origin of the D. and 

 the occiput is a little less than the length of the prreopercular 

 spine, the tip of which is directly below the fonnsr, while the inser- 

 tion of the P. is more posterior and the insertion of the V. still 

 more so. The third D. spine is the longest, the last being the 

 smallest and equals the second A. spine. The spines of the D. 

 are all more or less equal in thickness, not being swollen or one 

 much thicker than the other. The membrane connecting the 

 last D. spine with the first soft ray of the same fin is adnate to 

 the latter only at the extreme base. The soft D. is a trifle higher 

 than the spinous D., and its base is contained in the latter about 

 three times, and with its first ray not spinous. The caudal fin is 

 forked and with the upper lobe very little longer than the lower 

 and both lobes are beset both along the upper and lower basal 

 edges with 5 rudimentary rays, all ot which, excepting the last 

 posterior, are spinous. The third spine of the A. is greatly en- 

 larged and broadened and the fourth is ensheathed in its posterior 

 excavation. The first A. spine is exceedingly minute, being con- 

 cealed by the scales around the base of the fin. The P. and V. are 

 of equal si2e, the first ray of the latter being spinous and a little 

 longer than the innermost, while the first ray of the P. is very 

 short. Lateral line slightly recurved at first, then sloping gradu- 

 ally to its termination, though it does not run along the centre of 

 the caudal peduncle laterally and the pores do not exist on several 

 of the most posterior scales. Scales not striated, but with the 

 posterior edges finely serrated. There is a row of scales along the

base of the A. which is shorter than the base of the soft D.

The three specimens which I refer to this species have the fol- 

 lowing fin formula: D. xi, 14; xi, 14; xi, 14. A. iv, 9; iv, 9; 

 iii ?, 6 ? (the first A. spine of this latter specimen I am inclined 

 to think is really the second, though I am able to find but three) ; 

 P. i, 13; i, 13; i, 13; V. i, 7; i, 7 ; i, 7. The scales hi 

 the lateral line average about 52. The first ray of the soft D. 

 is not conspicuously enlarged and is much shorter than the second 

 and third which are the longest rays of the fin. The row of large 

 horny scales at the base of the A. is well developed in all three 

 examples.

LUTIANIDJE. 



6. Lutianus bohar (Forskal). 



Scicenabohar Forskal, Descript. Animal., 1775, p. 46. 



Form of the body oblong, compressed. Head large, 3^ in total 

 length, greater than the depth of the body which is about 3f in 

 the total length. Snout prominent, mouth large and with large 

 maxillary which does not extend posteriorly beyond the anterior 

 half of the eye. The width of the maxillary at its distal extrem- 

 ity is ecpual to half the diameter of the eye. Eyes 4J in head and 

 very slightly over twice their diameter in the snout, and situated 

 in the upper central portion of the head. Prseorbital bones large, 

 ensheathing the upper portion of the maxillaries. The inter- 

 orbital width greater than the diameter of the eye and with the 

 surface only slightly convex. The posterior margin of the prseoper- 

 culum is finely serrated above the notch, which is moderate, below 




486 • PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [I8y9. 



which and for a short distance along the lower margin, it is coarsely 

 serrated, the anterior portion of this lower margin being smooth. 

 The interoperculum is furnished with a small bony protuberance 

 which is opposite the prseopercular notch and into which it does not 

 fit. The operculum terminates in a small pointed flap which 

 extends backward beyond the base of the P. The mouth is 

 furnished with four canines in the front of both jaws, the outer 

 pair of the upper being the largest and the strongest. The poste- 

 rior nares are situated w-ithin half an eye diameter of the anterior 

 border of the eye. The profile line of the body from the snout 

 to the origin of the D. appears to be gently concave. The distance 

 between the anterior border of the eye and the first D. spine is 

 equal to the length of the P. The origin of the D. is situated 

 over the tip of the opercular flap, of cour'se falling posterior to 

 that of the P. Spinous D. longer than soft D., the radii x, 14, 

 the spines being strong and sharp, and graduated to the third, 

 which, with the fourth, fifth and sixth, are the longest, being, in 

 fact, longer than any of the soft rays. The scales of the body 

 pass over on to the basal portion of the soft D., covering it ante- 

 riorly for more than one-half its height, though this encroachment 

 gradually diminishes posteriorly so that only a few scales are to be 

 seen at the bases of these rays. The scales also pass out over the 

 basal portion of the soft rays of the A. and are distributed in the 

 same manner, though they do not extend out so far as on the soft D. 

 The caudal has its base also scaled, the scales of the caudal pedun- 

 cle passing over to the base of the tail in unbroken series, and 

 even covering the rudimentary rays, for about one-half its length. 

 All these scales which cover the portions of the fins mentioned are 

 much smaller than any others on any part of the body except a 

 few 7 at the base of the P. P. i, 16, not reaching A., but reaching 

 posteriorlv beyond the tips of the V. The origin of the V. 

 slightly posterior to the origin of the P. V. i, 5. A. iii, 8 ? 

 The third spine of the A. is the longest and the strongest, though 

 very little longer than the second. The tail is moderately forked, 

 the depth of the emargination being about one- fourth its length. 

 The spinous D. is more or less distinct from the soft D., to which 

 it is joiued. There are eight or nine rows of scales on the cheeks. 

 Operculum and interoperculum scaled and a row of large scales 

 from occiput to suprascapula and two rows between the former

row, and running parallel with it, and the eye. the rest of the 

 head naked except the scales in postocular region which are a 

 continuation of the series on the cheeks. Lateral line running 

 along the upper part of the body, and not running along the centre 

 of the caudal peduncle laterally, sloping from its dorsal position 

 gently till it terminates in the centre of the caudal fin. Scales 

 about 64. The general color of the specimen appears to have been 

 of an olivaceous tinge, the light spots at the base of posterior rays 

 of the D. very distinct. Irides reddish. Dark oblique bands 

 above the lateral line, and longitudinal bands below. Scales of 

 the thoracic and postoccipital region smaller than those on the 

 sides of the body. Upper caudal lobe the longest.

Diacope marginata Cuvier and Valenciennes, Hist. Nat. Poiss., II, 

 1828, p. 320. 



Form of the body sparoid, with the antero-dorsal region pro- 

 duced. The profile line from the snout to the occiput is straight 

 and from the latter point to the origin of the D. convex. The 

 lower profile line from the snout to the A. is nearly straight or 

 only verv slightly convex. Head a little over 3 in the total length 

 and the depth of the body about the same. Eyes placed in the 

 upper anterior portion of the head, nearer the snout than the 

 opercles and about 4 in the length of the head. Mouth large, 

 the maxillaries extending posteriorly for about one-third the diam- 

 eter of the eye. The distal extremity of the maxillary bones is 

 dilated and about equal to one-half the diameter of the eye. 

 The upper and anterior portions of the maxillaries are ensheathed 

 by the orbital bones. Nostrils separated from the anterior margin 

 of the eye by a space that is greater than the space between them- 

 selves. Interorbital space convex, not equal to the diameter of 

 the eve, equal to the space between the anterior nostril and the 

 anterior margin of the eye. Posterior margin of the prseopercu- 

 lum finely serrated above the notch, below and on the posterior 

 edge of the lower margin strongly serrated. Interopercular knob 

 developed and fitting closely into the pra?opercular notch. Poste- 

 rior margin of the operculum developed into a flap. Suprascapula 

 serrated. Origin of the D. over the tip of the opercular flap, 

 both of these are situated posterior to the origin of the P. D. x,

14, the third to sixth spine the longest. Bases of soft D:, caudal 

 and A. j covered with small scales though not extending very far 

 on any of the fins. Longest spines of D. longer than any of the 

 soft rays. Caudal eniarginate, though not deeply. P. falcate, 

 nearly extending to first A. spine, radii i, 14. V. situated 

 directly below P., radii i, 5, tips not extending posteriorly to tips 

 of P., though the tips of the latter may have reached as far as 

 the A. spine. A. iii, 8, second and third spines very stout and 

 about equal. A series of large scales from the suprascapula to 

 the occiput, anterior and parallel to this several series of smaller 

 ones. Opercles and interopercles scaled and the cheeks with 

 6 rows extending over the postocular region, and a row of small 

 scales directly over the eye toward the suprascapula, rest of head 

 naked. The ventral rays are very stout and strong. Lateral line 

 curved, then descending to the centre of the base of the caudal, 

 not running along the centre of the caudal peduncle laterally. 

 Scales about 55. Eye A of the least depth of the caudal peduncle. 



Teeth even, large. The color of this specimen has apparently 

 entirely faded, it being at present a pale buff-brown, with traces of 

 red irides. Total length lOf inches.

 8. Thalassoma immanis sp. now Plate XVIII, fig. 2 (middle figure). 



Shape of the body oblong-ovate, strongly compressed, its great- 

 est depth situated anteriorly and in the region of the P. fins. The 

 appearance is altogether very robust and strongly built. Greatest 

 depth of the body nearly as great as the length of the head, and 

 contained in the total length of the body about 3f times. Eyes 

 superior and slightly anterior in position, about 6^- iu the head, 3 

 in the snout and lij in the maxillary. Posterior margin of maxil- 

 lary about midway in the space between the tip of the snout and 

 the front margin of the eye. Upper and lower profile lines of 

 the head sloping anteriorly in the form of an isosceles triangle, 

 when viewed laterally, with the mouth at the apex. Interorbital 

 space convex, about If in snout and a little over 4 in the length of 

 the head. The eye is 1^ in the interorbital space. Head entirely 

 naked and with the skin on the cranium, the interorbital space, 

 the upper and anterior portions of the operculum, the posterior

and lower portions of the prceoperculum, the interoperculum, sub- 

 operculum, the branchiostegal region and the sides and lower or 

 under portion of the mandible papillose or rugose. On the upper 

 portion of the operculum are 3 shallow tube-like elevations par- 

 allel with its upper margin, and which become indistinct after 

 passing over the anterior half. The orbitals are strongly rugosely 

 striate. Teeth strong, canines strongly developed, two pairs in 

 the front of each jaw and the lower fitting in between the upper 

 pair when the jaws are closed. The other teeth in both jaws 

 are graduated from the canines backward, the largest of course 

 being anterior and about one-half the size of the canines. Ori- 

 gin of the P. inferior in the depth of the body and anterior to 

 the tip of the opercular flap which is very small. P. ii, 14, 

 perhaps slightly anterior to the V. which are contained in 

 the former 1^ and have the radii i, 5. Origin of the D. nearly 

 over the same of the V. radii viii, 13, the spines sharp, rather 

 strong, and not thickened, of about equal length, similar to the 

 soft rays which ai'e of nearly uniform length. A. ii, 10 or 11, the 

 first spine shorter than the second and the first soft ray the longest. 

 Upper and lower rays of caudal produced into a projecting point, 

 the lower reaching beyond the upper and the emargination being 

 thus formed is oblique. Rays of the caudal, like those of soft D. 

 and A. , very strong and stout, of the former fin the bases of those 

 which are produced are covered with several rows of small scales, 

 much smaller than the other scales at the base of the same fin. Scales 

 along the bases of the D. and A. smaller than those on the rest of 

 the body and extending somewhat upon the bases of the fins. 

 Scales about 28, the lateral fine straight to about the twentieth scale 

 when it falls and runs along the centre of the caudal peduncle. 

 The tubes of the lateral line with several branches on each scale, 

 some of which are in turn themselves branched. Most of the 

 color in life has disappeared, yet the head appears to have been 

 green, with the loreal region and the frontal region together with 

 the space behind and below the eye forming a band along the 

 margin of the praeoperculum, across the operculum and over the 

 interoperculum, of a different color. A green spot, in one speci- 

 men, divides the lighter color on the interoperculum and extends 

 for a short distauce upon the lower portion of the operculum, this 

 spot being much larger than the same of the largest specimen. A 




490 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



light band from the opercular flap to the caudal rays and directly 

 below this, and parallel to it, starting from the P. region, is an- 

 other similar band. Longitudinal stripes along D. and A., longi- 

 tudinal stripes along the inner of the produced caudal rays and the 

 basal half of the rest of most the caudal rays of the same color 

 as the lateral stripes. With the exception of a thoracic stripe 

 from the interoperculum backward the body is bright green. 

 Length about llf inches. The specimens which I refer to this 

 species show considerable color variation, which may be due to 

 individual variation. There are three specimens, one of which is 

 very young.

SCARID^. 

 9. Scarus promis sp. nov. Plate XVIII, fig. 3 (lower figure). 



Form of the body elliptical, oblong, compressed and with the 

 greatest depth more or less in the centre and apparently greater 

 than the length of the head which is contained in the total length 

 about 4J times. Eye not quite 6 in the head, about 2f in snout, 

 in post ocular region 2-| and in the interorbital space twice. 

 The greatest depth of the head is inferior to its length and the 

 upper profile line from the tip of the snout to the interorbital 

 space moderately convex, and from this latter point to the occiput 

 with a very strong convex appearance formed by the elevation of the 

 supraoccipital ridge. Snout produced, mouth small and with lateral 

 canine-like teeth, projecting externally, at the angle, there is one 

 on each side of the upper and two similar on the lower. The jaws 

 which are modified into a beak, which is small, have the teeth 

 small, at present whitish, and the lips appear to have covered the 

 greater portion. Origin of the P. below the level of the eye, 

 directly above that of the V., radii ii, 12, shorter than the head 

 and equal to the base of the P. V. \\ in P., radii i, 5, much 

 stronger than P. Origin of the D. a little behind that of the P. 

 and V., radii ix, 10, the spines rather firm, though they may 

 have been more or less pungent during life, and together with 

 the soft rays of uniform size. A. ii, 9, the soft rays of the D. 

 similar and the tips of both not much if any produced beyond a 

 point. Caudal rays strong, the outer produced into points thus 

 leaving the posterior edge deeply incised. Body covered with very 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 491 



large scales, a row along the base of the D., not much smaller 

 than those on the other parts of the body except some smaller scales 

 alongside the base of the A. The lateral line which is parallel 

 with the back to the region below the posterior D. rays, where it 

 is interrupted, traverses in this space 18 scales, it then appears 

 again on the autero-lateral region of the caudal peduncle and 

 traverses 5 or 6 scales, to the caudal. The tubes appear to be 

 single. The head, with the exception of the nasal, loreal, frontal 

 and labial regions naked, the rest covered with rather large scales. 

 Three rows of scales below the eye, the middle row with 6 and the 

 prseoperculum with 3. Scales on the opercles and cranium large. 

 General color greenish with the outer edges of each scale broadlv 

 bordered with light green or yellowish. The D. with a longitu- 

 dinal bar, of lighter color than the green, which bifurcates near 

 the middle which results in an intervening bar of the greenish 

 color of the rest of the fin. A. similar to the D., but without 

 the median green bar. P. and V. greenish, their lower and inner 

 portions lighter. A bar, evidently reddish and bordered above 

 and below by a dark olivaceous band from the anterior margin of 

 the eye across the snout. Total length 11^ inches. 

 No. 23,291. 



10. Scams lupus sp. nov. Plate XVIII, fig. 1 (upper figure). 



Form of the body oblong, elliptical, deep and compressed, the 

 greatest depth which is situated medianly about equal to the 

 length of the head and 3^ in the total length. Profile gently 

 convex from snout to origin of D. The eye is situated in the 

 upper portion of the head and nearly median, and in which it is 

 contained 6, and in the snout 24, and in the postocular region 

 2|, and in the interorbital space 2 and in the greatest depth of

Presentation of a Portrait of Carolus Linnccus by Mr. Charles 

 E. Smith. — The Secretary called attention to a life-size portrait in 

 oil of the great naturalist, and, presenting it to the Academy on 

 behalf of Mr. Smith, he read the following account of the way 

 in which the painting had been secured: 



Ladies and Gentlemen : — It is my pleasant task this evening to 

 present to you and to the Academy a full-length oil portrait of 

 Linnaeus, taken in his early manhood, in the dress he wore when 

 making his trip to Lapland — the only copy in this country. I 

 have been in search of it about twenty years. 



Sometime in the fifties, when we were at the corner of Broad 

 and Sansom streets, we received a number of steel engraved like- 

 nesses of Linnaeus, which the members were asked to buy, the 

 proceeds to be devoted to the erection of a tablet to Linnaeus at 

 Upsala. 



When we moved to this building, in 1876, I was in correspond- 

 ence with Mrs. S. M. Rust, President of the Ladies' Botanical 

 Club, of Syracuse, N. Y. I asked her if she had seen the en- 

 graving — if not, if she would like to have a copy. She replied 

 that she had not seen it, and would like to have one very much. 



I came here and asked Dr. Nolan for a copy of it. He replied 

 that he had none, and had not seen one since Ave had moved. I 

 then went to Mr. Lindsay, dealer in engravings, and asked him 

 to get me one. He wrote to various correspondents in the differ- 

 ent capitals of Europe, without success. I was much perplexed. 

 At last I had a bright idea, I got Mr. William Bell, one of our 

 best photographers, to make a copy slightly enlarged, which I 

 sent to Syracuse. 



Mrs. Rust, in her reply, said: " This likeness is not vouched 

 for. It has not even his name appended to it. How do you 

 know that it is Linnams ? It is too handsome for a man who 

 knew so much. These very handsome men never do know much. 

 I do not believe it is Linnanis. Where is the original portrait ?" 

 This raised a new question. I then tried to find the original por- 

 trait, A letter was written to the Royal Academy of Sciences, at 

 Stockholm, Sweden, asking where the original picture was. This 

 elicited no answer. In my correspondence with the Linnsean 

 Society of London, they mentioned that the original picture was 

 at Amsterdam, Holland. This was my first clue. 




1899. j NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 499 



Our late member, Dr. J. J. Levick, was going to Europe soon 

 after this. I gave him a photograph and asked him to keep a 

 lookout for it in the picture galleries. When he was in Amster- 

 dam one day, in a street-car, he met an American friend, who 

 asked him where he was going. He replied, " To the Academy of 

 Fine Arts, to find a portrait of Linnaeus for a friend." A lady, 

 sitting beside him, who understood English, turned to him and 

 very kindlv said: " You will not find that picture at the Academy 

 of Fine Arts. It is in the library of the Zoological Garden at 

 the other end of the city." The name of the Zoological Society 

 of Amsterdam is Nalura Artis Magistral the garden is popularly 

 called Artis. He went there and found it. It is the original of 

 the engraving. I wrote to the Society, and asked if they would 

 allow the picture to be copied, and would name an artist of repute, 

 who would be the best to do it. To this I got no answer. 



I have a nephew, Dr. Charles E. Smith, of St. Paul, Minn. 

 One of his patients is the Hon. Stanford Newel, our minister to 

 La Hague, Holland. I wrote to Mr. Newel, introducing myself 

 as the uncle of my nephew, asking his aid. He replied promptly 

 and warmly. In selecting an artist he examined the work of 

 about twenty of them. He asked the advice of Mr. Beaufort, 

 the Minister of State of Holland. They fixed on Mr. Boude- 

 wijnse. They also ascertained that the Artis picture is itself 

 a copy. The original belongs to Baron Verschuer, and is in his 

 country home near Haarlem, twenty -three miles from La Hague. 

 He was asked if he would allow a copy of it to be made. He 

 assented, but required that it be done at his house — that the pic- 

 ture could not be taken away. The artist objected to this, as the 

 light was not good. He said he could not do justice to the picture 

 or to himself unless he had it in a proper light. The baron then 

 yielded the point, and we have the picture. 



If it affords you half as much satisfaction to receive it as it does 

 me to give it, I shall be amply repaid. 



There are two remarkable blunders in the picture. The second 

 scientific trip of Linnaeus' life was to Lapland. On it he discov- 

 ered IAnncea borealis, described and named after him by Grono- 

 vius, the common name of which is twin flower, because each stem 

 bears two flowers. Linnaeus loved this plant very much. When 

 he was ennobled by the king of Sweden, he chose IAnncea for his 

 crest. 



Stockholm stands on a number of rocky islands, some of them 

 quite small. One of them is called Kitterholm, the Knights' 

 Island. When I was there in 1850, there was but one building 

 on it, called the Ritterholm Kirk — the Swedish Walhalla. It con- 

 tains statues of all the great men of Sweden, among them Lin- 

 naeus. It is of white marble. He stands with an open book in 

 his hand, on its page is an outline of Liancea. 




500 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



This picture represents him holding in his right hand two 

 specimens of Linncea, a tall one and a short one. The tall one 

 has three flowers and the short one only one, so that neither of 

 them is a twin flower. The leaves of Linncea are orbicular-spatu- 

 late, very obtuse and coarsely toothed. In the picture they are 

 ovate-cordate, acute and entire. That the artist should have 

 thought that one weed looked just like another is natural enough, 

 but that Linn reus should have overlooked these errors in his 

 favorite plant is very strange. 



The President accepted the gift, commenting on the Academy's 

 obligation to the donor, and stating that the portrait would be 

 hung in the museum in such a position as to secure the best possible 

 illumination. 



The following resolutions were proposed at the suggestion of 

 Mr. Smith, and adopted : 



Resolved, That the thanks of the Academy of the Natural 

 Sciences of Philadelphia be tendered to Baron Verschuer, of 

 Holland, for his kindness in allowing the portrait of Linnaeus, 

 belonging to him, to be coined for the Academy. 



Resolved, That the thanks of the Academy of the Natural 

 Sciences of Philadelphia be tendered to the Hon. Stanford Newel 

 for his judicious advice and valuable aid in securing for the 

 Academy the portrait of Linmeus, copied by Mr. Boudewijnse, 

 now in its possession. 



The following resolution was then unanimously adopted : 



Resolved, That the thanks of the Academy be voted to Mr. 

 Charles E. Smith for the life-size portrait in oil of Carolus Lin- 

 naeus, presented by him this evening, a gift which is valued not 

 only as a work of art, an adornment to the museum, and a 

 memorial of one of the world's greatest naturalists, but also as 

 an evidence of the continued interest of one to whom the society is 

 indebted for active aid and encouragement, extending over nearly 

 half a century. 



The following were ordered to be printed :

ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS ON GLACIERS IN BRITISH COLUMBIA. 

 BY GEORGE AND WILLIAM 8. VAUX, JR. 



Excluding the territory which lies to the north of the Arctic 

 Circle, all the principal glaciers of North America lie within the 

 great ranges of the Rocky Mountain system. These ranges stretch- 

 ing along the Pacific Coast are peculiarly well situated for the 

 formation of glaciers, which are found in places, probably not 

 inferior to the better known ice streams of. Switzerland. 



While one or two glaciers exist in the central part of California, 

 on the sides of Mt. Lyell, and further to the north in Oregon and 

 Washington on Mts. Hood and Ranier. it is not till the interna- 

 tional boundary is crossed that the scenery becomes truly Alpine 

 and glaciers are found of great size and striking characteristics. 

 As the ranges stretch northward they converge till at the narrow- 

 est portion they exceed but little a breadth of 400 miles. At this 

 point they are composed of parallel ranges, the outer ones being 

 nearly continuous, while the inner are more broken and cut by 

 deep valleys through which, in several instances, noble rivers find 

 their way. Beginning at the west, the most important of these 

 ranges are the Cascade, the Gold, the Selkirk and the Rocky; the 

 last two being the highest, the most Alpine and broken and the 

 most covered with glaciers. The reason for the greater glacier 

 activity in these eastern ranges is in part as follows: 



If a map of the Pacific Ocean be examined on which the cur- 

 rents have been marked, it will be seen that the Japan current, 

 after flowing past the islands of Japau, divides into two unequal 

 parts. The smaller of these takes a northeast direction through 

 Bering Sea and Strait into the Arctic Ocean, while the larger 

 portion assumes an eastern and then a southeastern course, bathing 

 the west coast of British Xorth America, and finally, being de- 

 flected to the south by the continent, and cooled, forms the Xorth 

 Equatorial current, which is a feeder to the Japan current. The 

 evaporation from this stream of warm water is very rapid, and 




502 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



the moist winds, the prevailing direction of which is eastward, soon 

 reach the coast line and the ranges of mountains beyond. Nearly 

 at right angles to the path of these moist winds lie the parallel 

 ranges of the Rocky Mountains. The Cascade and Gold Ranges, 

 not being high, the clouds pass over them with a comparatively 

 small precipitation on the western slopes, but on reaching the 

 higher and more rugged ranges of the Selkirks and Rockies, cooling 

 takes place more quickly, and the precipitation is very rapid. It 

 is for this reason that on the western slopes of the mountains the 

 snow is always deeper than on the eastern. The clouds a9 they 

 rise to cross the individual ranges are cooled, and give up their 

 moisture, which is precipitated before the summits are reached. 



While the annual snowfall in the Rocky Mountains is always 

 heavy, the winter of 1898-99 was one of the most severe since the 

 construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway during the late seven- 

 ties and early eighties. The record of snowfall, which is kept 

 with more or less regularity at Glacier House, shows an excess of 

 108 inches over the average of the three previous years, while the 

 rain, which unfortunately was not measured, must have added 

 materially to the total. At Field, in the Rocky Mountain range, 

 on the Kicking Horse river, the winter was no less rigorous than 

 the preceding ones, but the snowfall was much lighter than the 

 average of previous years, being twenty-three feet, as observed by 

 the watchman on the pass just above Field. The precipitation 

 from the winds as they blew eastward from the Pacific Ocean 

 took place earlier than usual, and while probably about the same 

 amount of rain and snow fell in both localities, the local fall in 

 the west was more and in the east less than the average. The 

 spring being late and the early summer cool, melting took place 

 without much damage from freshets, and resulted in the mountains 

 retaining more snow during the summer months than for several 

 years. 



In addition to this the summer was unusually cool. Snow was 

 noted frequently on the higher mountains and even down to the 

 lower levels. On August loth a heavy snowstorm broke over the 

 mountains, which lasted for several hours. Snow lay thick on the 

 ground at Glacier House, at an elevation of 4000 feet; at Field it 

 measured four inches on the platforms, while at Hector, the sum- 

 mit of the Kicking Horse Pass, there was a full foot. Clearing 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 503 



weather soon melted this at the lower levels, but on the mountains 

 the fall was heavier ami lasted for a longer period. It will be 

 interesting to watch the effect, if any, which this unusual season 

 will have on the glaciers of the locality. Of the glaciers observed, 

 both last summer and this, a much smaller recession took place 

 during the twelve months than in previous years. 



VICTORIA GLACIER. 



The Victoria Glacier, at the head of Lake Louise, Alberta, was 

 visited on the 26th of July, 1899. Although seldom seen by trav- 

 elers, it is almost as accessible, and probably more interesting, than 

 the Illecellewaet Glacier, in British Columbia. A row across the 

 beautiful Lake Louise, followed by a walk of about two miles 

 over a fairly good trail, brings one to the tongue, which is deeply 

 buried in a large and high moraine. Following the northwest side 

 of the valley, which has evidently been quite recently abandoned 

 by the ice, the surface of the glacier is reached with ease. Over 

 the lower part crevasses are almost entirely wanting, the drainage, 

 to a very large extent, taking place on the surface. 



For a distance of nearly one and one-cpiarter miles from the 

 tongue the surface is thickly covered with moraine composed of 

 shales, sandstones of several colors and limestones. These fall 

 with the avalanches from the hanging glaciers above, and many of 

 them are of large size. 



From indicatious which seem to be borne out by the observations 

 ■of others, 1 the glacier is receding and contracting. The slope of 

 the surface is small, the lower part being nearly flat, and the 

 motion is accordingly likely to be insignificant, though no observa- 

 tions have been made for its determination. For future reference, 

 a very large block of limestone, near the centre of the glacier, 

 and about one mile from the tongue, was located by range lines and 

 marked " VX, '99." The movement next year can easily be 

 determined from this rock. The position of the ice on the north- 

 west side was also located, being twenty feet distant from the nearest 

 of three very prominent and nearly cubical blocks of red sandstone, 

 which recently had been released from the ice.

 ix, p. 4. 




504 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



Many ji>retty examples of sand cones and glacier tables were to be 

 seen, while the avalanches, which at frequent intervals thundered 

 down the almost perpendicular cliffs of Mts. Lefroy and Victoria, 

 lent an awfulness to the scene truly in keeping with the surround- 

 ings. The lower glacier is almost entirely fed from those hanging 

 on the steep slopes above. 



ASULKAN GLACIER. 



The Asulkan Glacier was visited on the 12th of August, when 

 a picture was taken from the test rock of 1898, and three boul- 

 ders marked to determine in future the position of the tongue. A 

 search was made for the rocks marked by Mr. H. W. Topham 

 without result. Changes in the deposits about the glacier have 

 evidently taken place rapidly, and it is probable the rocks marked 

 by him have been covered up by fresh material. 



The tongue of ice seems to be slowly receding from the moraine, 

 as noted last year, 2 and it was possible to locate the limit of the 

 ice quite accurately. In order to fix its position on the above 

 date, a line, passing through three rocks and the tongue, was chosen, 

 the magnetic bearing of which was 85° 35' E. The rocks mark- 

 ing the two ends of this line were situated, one on the small mo- 

 raine just to the left of the glacier, and the other on the high 

 and stable moraine to the right, while the third and smallest rock 

 lay just below and to the right of the tongue. Bearings were 

 taken to locate these rocks with other prominent objects. 



The changes which have taken place in the glacier during the 

 year are not marked. A comparison of the test pictures of 1898 

 and 1899 shows a slight shrinkage in the height and a very slight 

 increase in the breadth, while the position of the tongue has not 

 changed to an appreciable extent. The ice fall about three- 

 eighths of a mile above the tongue, where a series of exquisite 

 seracs is to be seen, is visibly less than last year, and the neve 

 line is much lower. The hanging glaciers to the west, on the sides 

 of Mts. Castor and Pollux, are more active, and we noted a 

 number of pretty avalanches. These seemed to be very infre- 

 quent last year.

ILLECELLEWAET GLACIER. 



Owing to its accessibility, this glacier has been more carefully 

 observed than any other in the region. It may_be reached by a 

 good trail in thirty minutes from Glacier House, and we visited it 

 almost daily between the 29th of July and the 20th of August of 

 the present year. During this period, partly owing to the cold 

 and damp weather, but little melting or recession of the tongue 

 was noted. This was in marked contrast to the rate of melting 

 observed last year. 3 



The observations on this glacier naturally divide themselves 

 uuder four principal heads, which will be taken up as follows: 



1. Measurements of rate of flow. 



2. Measurement of recession and other changes since 1898. 



3. Photographic record from test rock " \Y." 



4. Survey of tongue, and mapping moraines and streams. 



1. Measurements of rate of flow. 



These were determined at nine points on the glacier, one a few 

 feet above the tongue, and eight on a straight line at right angles 

 to the flow and about 1500 feet above the tongue. Rev. \Yni. 

 S. Green, in 1888, 4 made a determination of the rate of flow by 

 driving stakes into the ice in a direct line. Owing to the rapid 

 melting, however, these soon fell, and when he returned to 

 remeasure, no accurate results could be obtained. Profiting by 

 his experience, we decided to employ plates of steel, six inches 

 square and one-eighth inch thick, in the centres of which holes 

 were bored and threaded to receive three-quarter-inch pipes, three 

 inches long. The original purpose of the pipes was to support 

 small flags to facilitate observation. It was found, however, when 

 the practical test came to be made, that if the plates were inverted, 

 with the pipes extending on the under side, they sank into the ice, 

 forming anchors, while the plates rested on the surface and could 

 be easily seen. The plates were given two coats of vermilion 

 paint, and lettered and numbered in white for identification.

affording an excellent view of the surface of the ice, we deter- 

 mined to use its ridge as the station for the transit. Observations 

 had been made to determine the mean direction of flow of the ice, 

 and on the 31st of July, 1899, the transit was adjusted on the 

 ridge. A large tree was taken as a line mark on the left side of 

 the valley. 



The plan of measuring a distance of 250 feet between the plates 

 by means of a tape measure was proved to be impracticable on 

 going on the ice. While the surface was comparatively smooth, it 

 was rolling and broken by valleys running at right angles to the 

 direction in which the measurements were to be made. In nearly 

 every case it was not possible to see from one plate to the next. 

 We accordingly decided to abandon the actual measurement, and 

 after adjusting the plates, to lay out a base line and take the 

 angles to the plates from each end. The results could then be 

 plotted on the map and the distances obtained. This plan worked 

 well, and on the second visit we were able to place a transit at 

 each end of the base line, and make readings of both angles at 

 the same time. 



Eight steel plates were laid out on the line shown on the map. 

 At this point the total breadth of the glacier is 1720 feet. Owing 

 to the rounded surface of the glacier the position for the ninth 

 plate was not visible from the ends of the base line, and as it was 

 quite close to the left border it was omitted altogether. 



On the 11th of August, or eleven days later, transits were set 

 up at each end of the base line and the bearings to each of the 

 plates taken. At the same time the exact movement of the plates 

 was accurately measured from the direct line in which they had 

 originally been placed. This will be found noted in the fourth 

 column of the table.

Table showing Motion of Line of Plates, across Illecellewaet Glacier, 

 British Columbia, July 31st to September 5th, 1S99. 



Again, on September 5, through the kindness of Mr. E. J. 

 Duchesnay, of Revelstoke, B. C, another measurement was made 

 bv Messrs. H. B. Muckleston and C. E. Cartwright. The posi- 

 tions of the plates on July 31st and September 5th only are shown 

 on the map, as the motion which had taken place up to August 

 11th was so small as to be hardly noticeable on that scale. 



These determinations show a marked decrease in the rate of flow 

 as compared with the observations of Rev. -William S. Green in 

 1888. They demonstrate the more rapid motion of the central 

 portion of the glacier, and also that the ice on the convex side of 

 the line of flow moves faster than on the concave side. 



Two of the plates, Xos. 4 and 8, could not be found on Septem- 

 ber 5th. All the plates were left on the ice, and it will be interest- 

 ing to determine the amount of flow during an eutire year if they 

 can be found again next summer. 



Besides the row of eight plates across the glacier, an addi- 

 tional plate (No. 9) was placed a few feet above the tongue and 

 measured at frequent intervals. The slope of the ice at this point 




508 



PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF

was about 40°, and as the reference point was located at the level 

 of the ground moraine below, the vertical height of the plate and the 

 diagonal distance were noted, from which the horizontal motion 

 was calculated. The vertical distance from the ground moraine 

 was obtained through a crevasse near by, while the direct distance 

 from the marked boulder was readily measured with the tape line. 

 Unfortunately, after these measurements had been made for sev- 

 eral days, and very satisfactory results obtained, a great mass of 

 the tongue on which the plate had been located broke away from 

 the main glacier. Immediately the daily rate of flow changed 

 from a little over five inches to a fraction under three, and 

 remained almost constant. Whether this apparent motion was due 

 to the melting of the plate in the ice, or to the reduced flow of 

 the smaller mass when not urged on by the parent glacier, was not 

 determined. The ci'evasses seemed to widen from day to day in 

 spite of the fact that the motion of the ice alone would cause them 

 to become narrower.

2. Measurement of reoession and other changes since 1898. 

 After the rapid changes of the last few years we were surprised 

 that very little alteration had taken place in the form of the 

 glacier since last summer. In the fall of 1898 the average daily 

 recession was nearly eight and one-tenth inches, while the average 

 annual recession was fifty-six feet. 6 Measurements showed that 

 on July 29th, 1899, the tongue was seventy-one feet above the 

 marked rock " C," (see map, Plate XX) and on August 20th, 

 seventy-six feet. These indicate a recession of but sixteen feet 



b Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1899, pp. 123, 124. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 509 



for the year as compared with fifty-six feet, the average of the 

 past eight years; and an average daily recession of but two and 

 three-tenths inches as compared with eight and one-tenth inches 

 in the same month of the previous year. On the right side, where 

 the ice has a much steeper slope, practically no change from the 

 position noted last year could be observed. 



A few local changes in the ice and moraines have occurred. 

 The great moraine on the left being supported on the ice foot is 

 constantly slipping down upon the glacier below. The right 

 moraine is much more stable, and no material change can be noted 

 in it. On the extreme left of the glacier local shrinkage and reces- 

 sion have taken place, uncovering a mass of bed rock, over which 

 the principal stream issuing from the glacier tumbles in a cascade. 

 This fall has existed for a long time, and it is probable that 

 before another year it may be covered again by the glacier. The 

 cascade will form an easily identified point for the limit of the 

 ice in 1899. 



After a careful examination of the test pictures of 1898 and 

 1899, taken from identical positions, it appears that the depth of 

 the ice in the upper regions of the glacier just below the neve is 

 increasing. This fact was also noted by a number of persons who 

 have been in the region for some time. 



3. Photographic record from test rock "W." 

 The taking of the test picture from the rock " W," from which 

 point the others had been taken, was accomplished on the 19th day 

 of August, 1899 — the same day of the year as the 1898 picture. 



4. Survey of tongue and mapping moraines and streams. 

 The accompanying map, Plate XX, the basis of which was a 

 trigonometric and photographic survey, may in future years prove 

 of interest in tracing the changes of the glacier and locating the mo- 

 raines and marked rocks. The first records of the position of the 

 glacier are in 1887, when it followed closely the narrow moraine in 

 which rocks " E," " R" and " A " are located. One year later. 

 on the visit of Rev. "William S. Green, a marked shrinkage and 

 recession had taken place, as shown by his photographs, and the 

 position of his tarred rocks, still plainly visible (marked "T" 

 "T" on map). 6 It is probable that each year since 1887 has 



6 Among the Selkirk Glaciers, p. 219. 




510 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



witnessed some recession of the ice. Before that time there are 

 indications that the glacier was either stationary or advancing. 

 The alder bushes and scrub evergreens which grow in places on this 

 moraine show, from their leaves and annual rings, an average age 

 of from twenty-two to thirty years. Taking the smallest number 

 noted — twenty-two years — and subtracting from it the twelve 

 years which have elapsed since 1887, there still remains an inter- 

 val of ten years, during which the glacier did not cover a greater 

 area than it did at the time we first observed it. We have no 

 means of knowing whether, during this period, the glacier was 

 advancing or retreating, but tbere is proof that in 1887 the tongue 

 occupied as low a position as at any time during the past twenty- 

 two years. 



This border moraine of 1887 offers several interesting features. 

 A large part of it is composed of two distinct moraines of nearly 

 equal size. The same characteristic is noted on the great left 

 moraine which, at a certain point, has a marked depression in the 

 ridge. As the amount of morainal material carried down by the 

 glacier is insignificant, these double moraines may mark the limit- 

 ing positions of two periods of advance, one of which took place 

 not far from 1887. 



The average of all the movements of the glaciers of this region 

 has been a marked recession, which is amply proved by the lines 

 of moraines abandoned in the valleys below. At one time, the 

 Illecellewaet and Asulkan Glaciers, which now terminate near the 

 heads of the valleys, extended till they joined and flowed as a 

 common ice stream. To estimate the time at which this took 

 place, or rather to fix a date since which the glaciers must have 

 been separate, the rings of a number of trees in both the Illecel- 

 lewaet and Asulkan Valleys were counted. In the Illecellewaet 

 Valley, at the Second Bridge, several examples were so counted, 

 the oldest of which showed 250 rings. In the Asulkan Valley, a 

 tree with 296 rings was noted, while one splendid example of 

 white spruce was thirteen feet five and one-half inches in circum- 

 ference. Allowing one riug to a year, this would indicate that 

 the recession of the two glaciers took a much longer time than has 

 been supposed by some. It is probable many hundreds of years 

 have elapsed since they were united and covered the ground now 

 occupied by the railway and the Glacier House.

In closing, acknowledgment is particularly due for the thought- 

 ful cooperation aud interest of Mr. E. J. Duchesnay, Division 

 Superintendent of the Canadian Pacific Railway, Revelstoke, B. C, 

 and of his assistant, Mr. C. E. Cartwright, for valuable assist- 

 ance in connection with the surveys. Also to Edouard Feuz, of 

 Interlaken, whose untiring interest, and skill on ice and rock, 

 contributed largely to the success of the results.

NOTES ON TECTIBRANCHS AND NAKED MOLLTJSKS FROM SAMOA. 

 BY C. ELIOT. 



Between the middle of May and the end of July, 1899, I 

 collected a number of mollusks on the coasts of the Samoan 

 islands, chiefly on the reef at Apia. Some of the Tectibranchs 

 and Nudibranchs which I obtained seem to me to be undescribed 

 species, and few of them have been examined in the living condi- 

 tion by more than one or two observers. I therefore submit the 

 following notes, to those who are interested in this group of ani- 

 mals. My best thanks are due to the authorities of the Smithso- 

 nian Institution at Washington and the Academy of Natural 

 Sciences of Philadelphia, especially to Mr. Pilsbry, for assistance, 

 and to Dr. Nolan for access to the Library of the Academy, 

 without which the specimens collected could not have been iden- 

 tified. 



Cryptophthalmus cylindricus Pease. Amer. Jour, of Conch., IV, p 74. 



Pease's description and figure are accurate. I obtained several 

 specimens of this animal at Apia. It is about an inch or an inch 

 and a quarter long and generally black, but two specimens of 

 apparently the same species are grayish white. The form is 

 elongated and cylindrical, the epipndia being closely applied to the 

 back, but the living animal sometimes contracts into a ball, and 

 all my alcoholic specimens have assumed this shape. The shell is 

 on the hinder part of the body, white, transparent, and nearly a 

 quarter of an inch long. It is external and not covered by the 

 mantle, though like all the dorsal region it is hidden under the 

 epipodia. Branchia on right posterior side of body adjacent to 

 the shell, but not covered by it. 



All my specimens were found in the interior of a closely grow- 

 ing, bushlike seaweed. 

 Doridium (Aglaia) Pilsbryi n. sp. PL XIX, fig. la, 16. 



Body oblong. Two dorsal shields, of which the anterior has 

 free margins all round and the posterior a free margin only behind, 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 513 



where it is bifid and covers a large branchial plume, which does 

 not come out between the lobes and is not visible from the upper 

 surface. No tentacles. Foot wide; sides recurved and extended 

 into small epipodia. Color rather bright green, changing to fawu 

 color at the edges; foot and branchial plume dark green. On 

 the anterior shield is a vivid black pattern like a large figure of 8, 

 on the posterior shield a somewhat similar pattern, but the lower 

 circle of the 8 is not complete. The edges of the epipodia are 

 irregularly marked in black and there are five black spots on the 

 foot. An alcoholic specimen measures 33 mm. long. 



I obtained a single specimen of this animal under seaweed on 

 the Apia reef. In captivity it was very sluggish in its movements. 



I have been unable to find any description corresponding to this 

 species, which is clearly distinguished from other Doridia by its 

 coloration and markings. Should I be right in supposing it to be 

 new, I propose to call it Doridium (Aglaia) Pilsbryi. 

 Aplysia (Tethys) nigrocincta Martens. 



I captured three specimens at Apia July 19, which seem ref- 

 erable to this species, though it is nut very fully described, and 

 recorded from Mauritius. 



The animals are about an inch and a half long, but are apt to 

 contract themselves into a ball, in which condition they become 

 much smaller. The color is light brown, with multitudes of 

 minute white spots, some of which are arranged in clusters so that 

 they appear like one large gray spot. The edges of the foot, man- 

 tle opening, rhinophores, tentacles and siphon are marked with a 

 fine but very distinct black border. The epipodia are ample but 

 thin, united behind the large siphon, but widely separate in front. 

 The mantle opening is very large and displays the shell, which is 

 large, convex and white, not yellow, as stated in the descriptions 

 •of Aplysia nigrocincta. 



The whole animal reminds one of Aplysia parva, which I have 

 seen alive at Key West. 

 Aplysia (Tethys) Benedicti, n. sp. PI. XIX, figs. 2a. 26. 



From July 19 to 21, I caught several examples of a species of 

 Aplysia, which was abundant in Apia harbor during this period, 

 on shallow sandy spots, and then vanished as suddenly as it had 

 appeared. 




514 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



The animals were singularly beautiful and very active, creeping 

 and swimming rapidly, the latter movement somewhat resembling 

 the flight of an insect. The body is plump and prolonged back- 

 ward into a short tail, the tentacles and rhinophores large and 

 leaflike. The epipodia are ample and winglike. They arise from 

 each side of the neck at a moderate distance from the rhinophores 

 with a clear space between them, but are united posteriorly. The 

 ground color is bright pale green, with a border of lilac or pale blue 

 around the edge of the epipodia. The outside of the epipodia, the 

 head, neck, sides of the foot and upper surface of the mantle are 

 marked Avith black reticulations, to which are added black eye-like 

 spots on the three regions first-mentioned. The inside of the 

 epipodia is marked with large irregular blotches of vivid black, 

 which, in some specimens, almost form a network pattern. The 

 lower surface of the mantle is black, and there is a distinct black 

 spot at the end of the tail on the upper surface. The skin is 

 smooth; there are no warts or filaments, but the edges of the 

 epipodia are wrinkled. The spermatic groove, proceeding from 

 the right oral tentacle, is very distinct. The mantle communicates 

 with the shell cavity through a small tube. The shell is of a fair 

 size, but very thin, and almost entirely membranous, with only a 

 slight calcareous deposit. There is a large greenish ctenidium, 

 which is not entirely covered by the mantle and shell. In front 

 of it is the genital orifice. The opening of the opaline gland is 

 single. The anal siphon is large. The sides of the stomach are 

 set with 12-16 closely packed, brownish, horny plates. The jaws 

 are long and leathery, and each divided lengthways into two halves, 

 one blackish brown, the other white. The radula is composed of 

 numerous teeth, the rows and the individual teeth being both very 

 close together. The central tooth (fig. 26, right side) consists of 

 a basal plate with three cusps, of which the median is the largest; 

 the lateral teeth (fig. 2b, left side) of a basal plate with a simple 

 long inner cusp and shorter outer cusp, without accessory denticles 

 along the margin. This form is retained even in the marginal 

 teeth, the two outermost only becoming vestigial. The length of 

 the specimen figured (in alcohol) is 75 mm. 



This species corresponds in many ways with Pease's description 

 of his Siphonota viridescens, but is much smaller and not at all like 

 his figure, particularly in the shape of the head. The coloration 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 515 



also seems to be different. Aplysia pulmonica var. Tryoniana 

 Pilsbry appears to be closely allied, and is recorded from Upolu, 

 but has a starlike pore in the mantle, a much more solid shell, 

 and no ocelli, and, to judge from the figure, differs in its general 

 shape. Another species with points of resemblance is Aplysia 

 dactylomela, from Bermuda and the Cape Verde Islands, of which 

 I have examined a specimen. But it differs in having ocelli with 

 a yellow centre, a longer interval between the epipodia and rhino- 

 phores, the epipodia not united posteriorly, the tail not black and 

 another form of teeth. The central tooth is unicuspid and the 

 laterals also have only an inner and not an outer cusp. 



My specimens, therefore, appear to me not to coincide with any 

 described species of Aplysia, and, if this proves correct, I would 

 propose to call them Aplysia Benedidi. 



Dolabella Hasseltii Ferussaq. PI. XIX, fig. 3. 



There is found in abundance at Apia, a species of Dolabella, 

 which is eaten by the natives, and which seems to be identical with 

 Dolabella Hasseltii, and particularly with the variety described 

 and figured by Quoy and Gaimard ( Voy. de V Astrolabe, Vol. II, 

 p. 306 ), though, if so, the coloring of their plate is not good. 



The animal, which is heavy and sluggish in its movements, is 

 generally found among seaweed growing on sand. When annoyed 

 it excretes a copious purple fluid. The body is about six inches 

 long and much broader behind than in front. The posterior disk 

 is very large and distinctly marked off. It is fringed with ragged 

 processes. The epipodial lobes are concrescent in front, the line of 

 junction forming a spermatic groove, and touch one another, though 

 they are not concrescent, in the region above the mantle, where 

 they form a dorsal slit with two wider openings, one anterior above 

 the ctenidium and one posterior above the excurrent siphon. 

 Color olive-green with dark brown and sandy patches admirably 

 imitating a mass of old seaweed. Though the animal is a con- 

 spicuous object if put in a basin, it is, thanks to its protective 

 coloration, almost invisible in its native haunts. The foot is dark 

 orange. The cavity surrounding the shell and mantle is large. 

 The mantle greenish and only partly covering the shell and the 

 large pale flesh-colored ctenidium. The shell is large and strong, 

 hatchet-shaped, the edge of the blade membranous, but the spire 




516 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



heavily callous, and in its natural position on the back of the 

 animal lower than the membranous portion. The part exposed is 

 greenish brown, the part covered by the mantle white. The oral 

 tentacles are auriform and directed forward, the rhinophores 

 stout and canaliculate. Length of the figured specimen (in alcohol) 

 11 cm. 



The walls of the stomach are set with about ten large horny 

 plates. The genital opening is beneath the gill, about the middle, 

 not at the posterior extremity. The purple gland is very large. 



The jaws are subtriangular, horny and brownish. The radula 

 consists of numerous close-set teeth, but the rows are somewhat 

 wide apart. Each tooth cousists of a narrow basal plate with one 

 long thin cusp. No central tooth or central space is distinguishable. 



I am inclined to think that D. Hasseltii Fe'r., D. variegata Pease 

 and D. Teremidi Rang are all one species. The last named 

 differs chiefly in having the mantle sky-blue, but in animals with 

 protective coloration environment might produce such variations. 

 Dolabrifera Gray. 



D. Tahitensis Pse. is common on all the islands under stones at 

 low-water mark. I obtained it at Apia, Manono and Tutuila. 

 Pease's description and plate (Amer. Jour, of Conchology, 1868, 

 p. 77, Plate vm, fig. 5) are quite accurate. In many speci- 

 mens the bright blue eyes are very large and conspicuous, but 

 there was some variety in this respect, as also in color. Perhaps 

 the distinction between D. Tahitensis and D. olivacea is not very 

 marked, and the two species may be connected by intermediate 

 forms. I also obtained one specimen of D. fusca at Apia, but 

 have nothing to add to Pease's description. 

 Notarclms Indicus Cuvier. 



Three specimens obtained at Apia in June seem referable to this 

 species, though smaller than the recorded size. The animal is 

 capable of assuming two forms of exceedingly different aspect, 

 one globular, and one sluglike and elongated. It is active in its 

 movements and in captivity seemed to prefer swimming to creep- 

 ing. As it moves, water is taken in through the dorsal opening 

 between the epipodia in the anterior part of the body, and ex- 

 pelled from it rhythmically. The integument is transparent and 

 allows the intestines to be seen distinctly. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 517 



Pleurobranchus delicatus Pse. 



Three specimens from Safotu, Savaii, in July. The animal 

 agrees with Pease's description (Amer. Jour, of Conehology, 1868. 

 p. 79), but is not very like his plate, being smaller and of a much 

 brighter orange except on the back, where the black viscera can 

 be seen through the skin. Branchia and orifices very prominent. 



Platydoris Bergh. 



Two species of this genus {scabra and arrogans) are common 

 under stones on Apia reef. They both grow to a length of 

 about three inches, and are characterized by their flattened form, 

 wide mantle, with irregularly indented edges, and a peculiar hard 

 and leathery texture, which distinguishes them at once from all 

 other Dorids which I have seen. They are sluggish in their move- 

 ments and do not appear to be protected by their coloration. P. 

 scabra (= Doris scabra Q. and G. ) grows to be about three inches 

 long. The outline is an irregular oval, the edge of the ample 

 mantle being wavy. The color is white, with irregular blotches 

 of brown produced by aggregations of small spots. The branchial 

 rosette is yellowish, sixfold and very voluminous and delicate. 

 Edge of foot brown, but sole and under surface of mantle white. 

 Labial tentacles small, white and tapering. The branchial aper- 

 ture is clearly defined and starlike. Platydoris arrogans Bgh. 

 (= Doris omenta Q. and G. ) has the same external characters 

 as PL scabra, but the markings are formed, not by minute spots, 

 but by fine lines. In addition to them there are on the back 

 four or five splashes of vivid red, looking like red ink, which disap- 

 pear in alcohol. 

 Discodoris fragilis (A. and H.), Bergh. 



Boris fragilis Alder and Hancock, Trans. Zool. Soc., Vol. 5, 1864, 

 pp. 117, 38. From east coast of India. 



This animal is common on Apia reef. In life it is brownish 

 green, mottled with darker shades of the same color, the foot and 

 under surface of the mantle being similarly marked. The rhino- 

 •phores and branchial rosette are brownish and the labial tentacles 

 white and pointed. The whole body is flat and oval, and the 

 length from two to three and a half inches. 



The creature is remarkable for its extraordinary powers of self- 

 mutilation. When handled, it throws off part or the whole of 




518 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



the mantle edge, in some cases leaving behind it a complete ring 

 of mantle more than a quarter of an inch wide, while the central 

 part crawls away, appai'ently none the worse for the loss. The 

 animal can hardly be described as ' ' brittle, ' ' for it is gelatinous 

 to the touch and secretes an abundant mucus. The process of 

 amputation is not rapid, and would not protect the Discodoris 

 against a fish or any quick-moving animal, but might perhaps 

 enable it to escape the attacks of a carnivorous mollusk. I did not 

 succeed in discovering what its enemy may be. 



Chromodoris scurra Bergh. 



This brilliantly colored species is common on the coasts of all the 

 Samoan islands, and, though rarely an inch long, is conspicuous 

 owing to its ornamentation, which must be warning. The back 

 is striped with lines of white, violet and bright orauge. The 

 large rhinophores and the branchial rosette are violet at the tips 

 and orange in the lower parts. Bergh' s Plate xxxiii (in Semper' s 

 Reisen, II, 2) hardly does justice to the vivid coloration of the 

 living animal. 



Chromodoris inornata Pse. 



Common on Apia reef. I do not know why Pease distinguished 

 this beautiful animal by so inappropriate an epithet as " un- 

 adorned." The back and foot are white, subpellucid and spotted 

 with purple. The mantle, but not the foot, which projects con- 

 siderably behind, is bordered tvith a line of bright orange. The 

 sevenfold branchial star is grayish yellow, and the upper part of 

 the large rhinophores bright orange. The labial tentacles, which 

 are of moderate size, are faintly tinged with the same color. The 

 foot is long and narrow, and the length of the whole animal rather 

 more than an inch. 



Chromodoris sp. 



Very dark green, edge of mantle bluish, shape very variable. 

 Mantle edge indented or not at will of animal. Rhinophores" 

 dark green, tipped with Avhite. Branchial rosette dark green, 

 rather large. Labial tentacles very small. Foot light gray. 

 Viscera visible from under surface. Tail much longer than mantle. 

 One specimen at Manono.

Trippa areolata (A. and H.) Bergh. 



This animal aftorrls an extraordinary example of mimicry. It 

 so exactly resembles a shell or old stone overgrown with green 

 and bine seaweeds and with sponge that it is absolutely invisible 

 when crawling on such objects. When the specimen which I 

 caught was placed in a basin with shells it took up a position on 

 an old Strombus, and could not be distinguished from the growths 

 and accretions by which it was surrounded. 



The body is deeply indented with cavities like those made by 

 worms in stones. The rhinophores and branchial rosette are 

 grayish brown, and in spite of their size, inconspicuous. 



This animal is described by Alder and Hancock (Trans. Zool. 

 Soc, Vol. V, 1864) as Doris areolata, and recorded from the east 

 coast of India. Bergh refers it, with a query, to his genus 

 Trippa. The dentition shows that it undoubtedly belongs to this 

 genus. There are no jaws, but the radula resembles that of T. 

 ornata Bgh. There is no central tooth, but about forty laterals 

 on each side. The innermost teeth are very small, but increase in 

 size up to the fifteenth, after which they become equal, except 

 the two or three outermost, which are reduced. The transverse 

 rows are nearly straight at the sides, bnt bend downward in the 

 middle. 



Doris setosa Pse. 



Bergh, in Semper' s Reisen, II, 2, supplement Plate G, gives a 

 figure of Doris setosa from Pease. Proc. Zool. Soc, XVIII, 1860, 

 p. 26, which he seems unable to assign to any of his genera. 

 Last July I captured at Mulifanua, Upolu, three specimens of an 

 animal which, except in color, appears to agree with Pease's plate. 

 The largest specimens were an inch loDg. The upper surface, 

 branchial rosette and rhinophores were brownish, yellow with 

 darker brown spots. The under surface of foot and mantle 

 whitish. The branchial star was ten* plumed and protected by 

 two lateral lobes; the anal tube prominent. The whole dorsal 

 surface covered with villous projections, which contain spicules, 

 and can be scraped off, leaving a smooth surface. The radula 

 consists of five rows of simple hamate teeth. There is no central 

 tooth and the formula is 19 (or 18) 0. 19 (or 18). Jaws are 

 absent.

Doridopsis herpetica Bergh. 

 Doris compta Pse. 



Beautiful pearl gray, with spots of same color, but 'darker. 

 Khinophores and sixfold branchial rosette with faint yellowish 

 tinge. Foot and under surface of mantle pearl gray with small 

 spots. Labial tentacles small, whitish. Body slightly trans- 

 parent, showing reddish intestines. Pharynx long, cylindrical; no 

 jaws; no radula. 



Pease's plate (Doris compta, Amer. Jour, of Conch., 1871-72, 

 PI. 4, fig. 1) is fairly like the living animal, but he is mistaken 

 in supposing that the mantle edge is permanently and regularly 

 indented. The animal is sluggish in its movements, but con- 

 stantly alters its shape; it is sometimes elongated and sometimes 

 oval, and can wrinkle and undulate the edge of the mantle at 

 will. 



Trevelyana citrina Bergh. 



One specimen obtained at Apia in July. It corresponds accu- 

 rately in color and other external characters with Bergh' s descrip- 

 tion and plate in Semper' s Reisen 1 (II, 2, PI. xli). 



With regard to this and all other tropical Polyceridce which I 

 have seen, I would observe that the expression non-retractile, 

 applied to the rhinophores and branchiae, is only comparatively 

 true. In Dorididce the branchiae, when touched, disappear 

 entirely, reemerge slowly, and are, as a rule, invisible in alcoholic 

 specimens. In the Polyceridce they generallv remain outside in. 

 alcoholic specimens, but when touched in the living animal, retract 

 themselves into a pocket, though perhaps less thoroughly, and for 

 a shorter time than in Dorididce. But to say that a genus or 

 family is characterized by non-retractile branchiae may lead an 

 observer into error. 

 Cyerce nigra Bergh. 



This beautiful animal appears to be common, as I captured 

 numerous specimens at Apia and Manono. It crawls rapidly, but 

 I have not seen it swim. When it is walking its many cerata are 

 agitated with a motion similar to that of a field of corn under the 

 wind. 



1 By an oversight corrected in another part of Bergh's work the animal 

 figured in the plate is called Nembrotha. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 521 



Placobranchus gracilis Pease. 



One specimen. Apia reef. June, under a stone. Buff- 

 colored, with green eye-like spots, surrounded 'with bright black 

 rims. Epipodia reflected over the back and striped internally 

 with longitudinal bright green ridges. Edges of epipodia and 

 frontal veil and tentacles violet colored. On a prominence 

 between the tentacles are two distinct black eyes. 



Bornella Gray. 



I obtained two species of this genus at Apia. The first is B. 

 arborescens, described by Pease in the Amer. Jour, of Conch., 

 1870-71, p. 302). I have nothing to add to his account except 

 that the red coloring is rather brighter than in his figure. The 

 second I somewhat doubtfully identify with B. Hancockana 

 (Kelaart, in Annals and Magazine of Nat. History, 1859, VoL 

 IV). In life the body was subpellucid, and the back mottled with 

 yellow. Over the mouth are two stellate processes with about ten 

 rays each. The rhinophores are greenish and retractile into four- 

 fingered sheaths. There are five pairs of cerata, four containing 

 hepatic diverticula, and all bearing branchiae. The three anterior 

 cerata are trifid, the two posterior bifid. There are two black eyes 

 under the skin just in front of the rhinophores. The animal is 

 very active and crawls and swims rapidly. 



Elysia nigropunctata Pse. 



A single specimen captured at Apia seems midway between the 

 species called by Pease Pterogastron (= Elysia) marginatum and 

 Pterogastron nigropunctatus. The body was greenish, with black 

 and white spots, as in his figure of the latter (Amer. Jour, of 

 Conch., 1870-71, p. 304), but the lateral lobes are edged with a 

 single line of orange, somewhat less conspicuous than in his figure 

 of the former. On the whole, I think the animal should be called 

 Elysia nigropunctata. 



Elysia Hendersoni n. sp. PL XIX, fig. 4. 



In July I found twelve specimens of an Elysia on green seaweed 

 at Manono, which do not appear to me to be referable to any 

 species of which I have seen the description. The outer surface of 

 the animal is greenish, with yellowish markings, and resembles a 

 piece of seaweed sprinkled with sand. The interior of the 




522 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



epipodia is bright green and striated with numerous hue veins. The 

 epipodia are indented at their edges, and united behind in a very 

 ample dorsal expansion. On the back, a little behind the two 

 tentacles, is an elongated, bladder-like projection, containing the 

 heart, which pulsates regularly and rapidly. From this arise three 

 main trunk veins, each of which is numerously subdivided. This 

 arrangement seems to distinguish the animal from Ehjsia viridis, 

 and the coloration is unlike that of the other species described. 

 If it proves to be a distinct species, I would propose to call it 

 Elysia Hendersoni. Length, in alcohol, 17 mm. 

 Onchidium Tonganum Quoy and Gaimard. 

 Peronia tongana. 



This curious animal is very common on the Apia reef at low- 

 water mark. It is oval in shape, and attains a length of nearly 

 three inches. The mantle is of a dirty olive green, thick and cov- 

 ered with processes and w T arts, on some of which are eyes. The 

 tentacles are short, but the labial palps enormous. 



Though an ungainly looking creature, Onchidium displays 

 greater activity and intelligence in its movements than any mollusk 

 except Cephalopods which I have seen. It may almost be said to 

 run, and if placed in a vessel at the bottom of a boat will make 

 a determined effort to climb over the sides and reach the sea. As 

 it moves, the large posterior pulmonary orifice opens widely and 

 contracts. It must be capable of living under water, as it fre- 

 quents reefs which are submerged except at low tide, but in cap- 

 tivity, when placed in sea water, it invariably came out and wan- 

 dered on the balcony, but specimens placed under a heap of wet 

 seaweed remained quiet. It has been stated that Onchidium has 

 dorsal eyes only in those regions where Periophthalmus is found, 

 and that they assist it to escape the attacks of the fish. I cannot 

 support this statement from my own observation, for, though 

 Periophthalmus is common in Samoa, it frequents mud flats and 

 mangrove swamps, and I have never seen it on the edges of coral 

 reefs which are the habitat of Onchidium. 



It will be noticed that the majority of the Nudibranchs de- 

 scribed belong to the Dorididce or Elydoidea, and that the JEolidoz 

 and allied families are entirely absent. As Pease, who collected 

 chiefly in the Society and Hawaiian islands, also describes no 

 iEolids, it looks as if the group was not numerous in the central 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 523 



Pacific, though on the shores of California it is very abundant. 

 Many of the less-known species which I found have evidently a 

 wide distribution. Thus Trippa areolata had previously been 

 reported from the coast of Madras, Dolabella Hasseltii from Java 

 and Mauritius, and Aplysia nigrocincta from the latter locality. 

 Though the coast of Samoa is exceedingly rich in marine life, I 

 observe that many species are smaller than those described from 

 other places. 



Cyerce nigra, Aplysia Benedicti and Elysia Hendersoni were 

 found in small flocks or families of from ten to fifteen individ- 

 uals ; Dolabella and the Dorididoz mostly in pairs.

A NEW AMERICAN SPECIES OF ZONITOIDES. 



BY EDWARD G. VANATTA. 



Zonitoides nummus n. sp. 



Shell discoidal, shining, translucent, waxen white. Spire very 

 flat, composed of 3f rather convex slowly increasing whorls ; suture 

 impressed growth lines [slight. The umbilicus is very wide, its 

 width contained in the greatest diameter of 

 the shell about 2J times. Aperture irregu- 

 larly rounded-lunate, parietal callus thin. 



Alt. 0.5, greatest diam. 1.5, lesser diam. 

 1.33 mm. 



New Braunfels, Texas. 

 The type is in the collection of the Academy 

 of Natural Sciences, No. 68,834. 



This species has the color and texture of 

 Z. singleyanus Pils., but with the same num- 

 ber of whorls it is much smaller, being only 

 about one-half the size. It also differs from 

 Z. minusculus Binn., in being much smaller 

 and flatter. 



It can easily be distinguished from the 

 other members of the Z. minusculus group 

 by the wide ^umbilicus, discoidal form, and 

 the slowly increasing whorls. 



On examining cotypes and description of Z. Iceviusculus Sterki, I 

 find it is a synonym of Z. singleyanus Pils.

ADDITIONS TO THE JAPANESE LAND SNAIL FAUNA. 

 BY HEXRY A. PILSBEY. 



The forms described below occurred in a collection of Japanese 

 mollusca obtained by Marshall R. Gaines, President of Tillotson 

 College, Austin, Tex., "while resident and engaged in educational 

 work in Japan some years ago. 



They were chiefly collected by his pupils; and being accom- 

 panied by exact locality data, are a substantial addition to our 

 knowledge of the terrestrial mollusks of Japan. 

 Diplommatina tenuiplica n. sp. 



Shell similar in form, size and external sculpture to D. collari- 

 fera Schm. and Bttg., but of a reddish brown color, the columellar 

 lamina within the whorl decidedly thinner and weaker, less ob- 

 lique ; lamina within the outer wall (visible through from the out- 

 side on the front of the last whorl) distinctly shorter. Crest 

 behind the lip less developed and nearer the lip. 



Kashima, Harima (Marshall R. Gaines). 

 Ennea Iwakawa n. sp. PI. XXI, fig. 10. 



Shell small, cylindrical, with small, deep, circular umbilicus, 

 the latter 3 or 3+ whorls of about equal diameter, those above 

 convexly tapering; white ; surface sculptured with numerous 

 strong but slender longitudinal laminar riblets, curving to the left 

 above, to the right below, and about 27 in number on the last 

 whorl, absent on the apical li whorls. Whorls 6i, slightly con- 

 vex, the last tapering below, obtusely keeled at the base. Aper- 

 ture small, subtriangular, wider above; peristome continuous, 

 narrowly reflexed, emarginate at the position of the parietal 

 lamella, the outer lip with a short rounded sinus above; the cavity 

 contracted by an oblique, deeply placed fold on the columella, two 

 nodular teeth upon the outer lip, the upper one submarginal, the 

 lower further within, and a long, high sinuous parietal fold, which 

 runs about one-half of a whorl inward, bending to the left a 

 short distance within.

Helix lata Gld. 1859, not Helix lata. Pfr. 1854. Vide Novitates Con- 

 chologicse, pi. 143, figs. 17, 18, 19. 



This species differs from the typical forms of the subgenus Acusta 

 in having the peristome distinctly reflexed in adult examples. 

 The figures cited above, represent a specimen not quite mature and 

 less strongly wrinkled than my type. The color is either olive 

 brown or olive yellow without bands, or varied by two broad 

 bands. The interior of the aperture is blue gray, the columella 

 pinkish lead color, pale pink at the outer edge, like the whole 

 outer lip. The surface is glossy, coarsely wrinkled along the lines 

 of growth, showing spaced engraved spirals under the lens, and an 

 extremely minute, dense criss-cross scratching throughout when 

 not obliterated by wear. Whorls 5 J.

Eulota luna n. sp. PI. XXI, figs, l, 2, 3. 



Shell low-conic above, flattened below, with a large well-like 

 umbilicus, one-eighth the diameter of the shell, very slowly con- 

 tracting as it penetrates; white under a thin, pale yellow cuticle, 

 with two narrow chestnut bands, one above, the other below the 

 periphery, the former visible above the suture on the whorls of the 

 spire. Surface rather glossy, with fine irregular growth wrinkles 

 and some subobsolete spiral lines above. Spire conic with convex 

 lateral outlines. Whorls 6i, slowly, regularly widening, convex, 

 the last rather more descending, with rounded periphery and base, 

 not deflexed in front. Aperture oblique, lunate oval; peristome 

 acute, outer margin slightly and the basal more expanded, dilated 

 at the columellar insertion, impinging upon the umbilicus. 



Alt. 16^, greatest diam. 20+ , least 19+ mm.

Eulota (JEgista) aperta n. sp. PI. XXI, figs. 7, 8, 9. 



Shell perspectively umbilicate, the umbilicus exceeding one- 

 fourth the diameter, at first rapidly widening, showing much 

 of the penultimate whorl, then gradually narrowing. Corneous 

 brown. Surface dull, Avith fine wrinkles of growth, bearing cutic- 

 ular lamina? which are in large part rubbed off in the speci- 

 mens described, and under a lens fine subobsolete spiral strise may 

 be seen on the base, at least in places. Spire low conoidal with 

 slightly convex lateral outlines. Whorls 5^, moderately convex, 

 slowly increasing, the last decidedly wider, rounded at the periph- 

 ery and beneath. Aperture quite oblique, subcircular, but 

 little excised by the penultimate whorl; peristome thin, very 

 slightly expanded, more so below and on the columellar margin, 

 the latter scarcely dilated at the insertion. 



Alt. 8.4, greatest diam. 14.2, least 12.3 mm. ; length and width 

 of aperture 6.2 mm. (including peristome). 



Toyonishikami, Prov. Nagato (Gaines). 



This is one of those Japanese Helices of uncertain position, with 

 the peristome less developed than in JEgista, more as in the Euro- 

 pean " Fruticicolas." It is distinguished by the large umbilicus 

 and the minutely shaggy cuticle. It has the form but not the 

 texture or color of Helix macrocycloid.es Kobelt. 



Eulota cavicollis n. sp. PI. XXI, figs. 11, 12, 13. 



Shell openly and deeply umbilicated, the umbilicus ample, show- 

 ing all the whorls, its diameter contained 3^ or four times in that 

 of the shell. Corneous brown. Surface dull, when quite unworn 

 clothed above with short compressed cuticular laminse which gather 

 and hold dirt, but usually these are worn off, leaving the surface 

 finely striated, the stride a little stronger toward the sutures, base 

 smoother. Spire elevated, the lateral outlines convex. Whorls 

 6^ to 7^, very narrow, closely coiled, slowly widening, the last one 

 abruptly and very deeply deflexed in front, constricted behind 

 the peristome. Aperture nearly horizontal, truncate oblong; 

 peristome thin, narrowly reflexed throughout, the upper margin 

 of the outer lip somewhat straightened or sinuous.

A very peculiar little shell, not like anything hitherto reported 

 from Japan, and probably typical of a new subgenus which pend- 

 ing anatomical details may be subordinated to Eulota, and thus 

 denned: Cwlorus, n. s.-g. Mound-shaped, with numerous narrow 

 whorls, ample umbilicus, and subhorizontal aperture with thin, 

 reflexed, discontinuous peristome. 

 Eulota rudis n. sp. PI. XXI, figs. 4, 5, 6. 



Shell depressed-conoid, umbilicated, the umbilicus a little over 

 one-fifth the diameter of the shell, rather narrow within, rapidly 

 expanded at the last whorl. Solid ; dull reddish brown, with irreg- 

 ular whitish lines and some darker streaks. Surface irregularly 

 striated, the strife stronger at the margin of the umbilicus. Spire 

 conoidal. Whorls 6i, slowly widening, the last whorl rather 

 wider, decidedly descending in front, somewhat tubular. Aper- 

 ture oblique, rounded, slightly excised by the penultimate whorl; 

 peristome a trifle thickened, the outer lip somewhat expanded, 

 basal and columellar margins more expanded; terminations consid- 

 erably approaching. 



Alt. 11, greater diam. 14, lesser 12.5 mm. ; width of aperture 

 6.5, oblique height 6 mm. 



Omi, Japan (M. R. Gaines). 



A rude-Jooking, dark reddish shell, with somewhat the aspect of

 Ganesella satsuma n. sp. PI. XXI, figs. 20, 21, 22. 



Shell globose trochiform, narrowly and obliquely perforate, thin, 

 translucent, the internal pillar faintly visible through its substance; 

 whitish-corneous, tinted a little with brown on the base. Surface 

 rather glossy, with light, irregular growth wrinkles, cut by fine, 

 close incised spirals which are distinct on the earlier, subobsolete 

 on the last whorl. Spire elevated, with convex lateral outlines. 

 Whorls 6£, convex, slowly widening, the last distinctly though 

 shortly deflexed in front, rounded at the periphery, convex be- 

 neath, indented around the axis. Aperture oblique; peristome 

 white, expanded, thickened within, the basal and columellar mar- 

 gins reflexed ; basal margin straightened, sloping, with a slight 

 callus within; columellar margin very short, subvertical, concave, 

 dilated and nearly closing the umbilicus, which it wholly conceals 

 from below.

Kyoto (Marshall R. Gaines). 



Closely allied to G. japonica, and to some extent a transition 

 species between the japonica and the papilliformis group3 of Gan- 

 esella. It differs from G. japonica in the greater elevation, com- 

 pletely rounded periphery and almost closed umbilicus. 

 Ganesella ferruginea n. sp. PI. XXI, figs. 14, 15, 16. 



Shell shaped much like G. japonica, russet brown, paler near the 

 suture and outer lip, girt at the periphery with a chestnut band 

 bordered below by a corneous one; umbilicus pale corneous within. 

 Surface slightly shining, striatulate, seen under a strong lens to be 

 covered with a dense fine granulation, the granules point-like, in 

 places arranged in obhque rows sweeping nearly at right angles 

 with the growth lines, but on the base this arrangement is nearly 

 lost. Spire convexly conic; whorls 5^, the last rounded at the 

 periphery and beneath, hardly deflexed in front. Aperture 

 oblique, the lip expanded, thickened within, white ; basal lip 

 reflexed, straightened, with a slightly convex callus within; um- 

 bilicus deep, moderately wide, about one-third covered by the 

 dilated columella. 



Alt. 13, greater diam. 17^, lesser 16^ mm. 



Okayama, Prov. Bizen (Gaines). 



Similar to G. japonica, from which it differs in the russet color

 Ganesella heteroglypta n. sp. PI. XXI, figs. 17, 18. 19. 



Shell somewhat trochiform, narrowly and almost closed umbili- 

 cate, thin, somewhat translucent, yellow-corneous, with a slight 

 olivaceous tint, a faint darker peripheral band, light-bordered 

 below. Surface with a dull silken lustre, produced by a clothing 

 of microscopic papillae or low elongated granules, irregularly and 

 densely placed. Spire elevated, with convex outlines. Whorls 

 fully 6, moderately convex, swollen just below the sutures, Ihe 

 last whorl obtusely angular at the periphery, becoming rounded 

 on the latter portion, convex beneath, very slightly deflexed in 

 front, and constricted behind the peristome. Aperture oblique; 

 outer lip expanded, thickened within, basal lip reflexed, straight- 

 ened, calloused within; columellar lip very short, dilated, nearly 

 covering the umbilicus.

Like the two preceding species, this is allied to G. japonica, 

 having the same form of aperture. It differs from \G. satsuma 

 chiefly in the fine sculpture, which consists of a dense granula- 

 tion, without spiral incised lines. It differs from G. japonica in 

 sculpture and the reduced umbilicus; from G. ferruginea in the 

 pale coloring, small umbilicus and different sculpture.

KEPORT OF THE RECORDING SECRETARY. 



The average attendance at the meetings during the year has in- 

 creased to 29. A quorum was lacking twice in midsummer, while 

 the largest attendance at any meeting was 143. The plan of 

 sending postal card notices of the meeting has been continued 

 with good results. When the communications have been records 

 of original observations they have been reported by the authors 

 and published in the Proceedings. Such, of course, are of most 

 importance, but in their absence it has been found desirable to 

 secure resume's of progress in various fields of science, reports of 

 collecting trips and explorations, remarks on current additions to 

 the museum and other matters not strictly original, but yet of 

 interest to those who find in them sufficient reason for attendance 

 at the meetings. 



Communications have been made by Messrs. J. C. Morris, Gold- 

 smith, Dixon, Keeley, Calvert, Schumo, Heilprin, Pilsbry, Dall,

Five hundred and thirty-eight pages of the Proceedings, illus- 

 trated by eighteen plates, and the second number of the eleventh 

 volume of the Journal have been published, the latter consisting 

 of one hundred and thirty- eight pages and five plates. In addi-

The first series of the Manual of Conchology having been com- 

 pleted last year, the publications of the Conchological Section have 

 been confined to the section of Pulmonata, as it has been deemed 

 advisable to postpone, for the present, work on the marine bivalves, 

 which will constitute the continuation of this important contribu- 

 tion to conchology, if the resources of the Section will warrant the 

 undertaking. One hundred and seventy-six pages of Vol. XII of 

 the second series, Puhnonata, illustrated by 46 plates, have been 

 published. 



The Academy's publications, therefore, during the year, have 

 amounted to 1416 pages and 81 plates, a gratifying increase over 

 the issue of last year.

 The edition remains as heretofore, 1,000 copies of the Proceed- 

 ings and 500 copies of the Journal.

remaining on hand. It is hoped they may remain here until 

 disposed of by sale or exchange. The plates damaged by the 

 flood of last year have not yet been reprinted. 



Eleven members have been elected since the last report. Dur- 

 ing the same period the deaths of fourteen members have been 

 announced, five have been dropped for non-payment of dues, and 

 seven resignations have been recorded, making a nst loss of 

 fifteen. Twelve correspondents have been added to the roll and 

 the deaths of twelve have been recorded. 



A proposition to revise the By-Laws was referred to the Council, 

 February 21. After careful consideration at one stated and two 

 adjourned meetings an amended code was reported to the Acad- 

 emy. It was adopted after reading, at meetings held April 27, 

 May 2 and 9. The most important changes embodied in the new 

 code are the substitution of Assistant Curatorships, the titles and 

 duties of which are to be defined by the Council, for the Profes- 

 sorships, the repeal of the clause limiting the possible continuous 

 term of the presidency to four years, and providing for the ap- 

 pointment of a Committee on Accounts in addition to the Com- 

 mittee on Finance. Numerous verbal alterations were also made, 

 redundancies removed and related clauses placed in juxtaposition, 

 resulting, it is believed, in a clearer and more explicit code than that 

 which it replaces. 



The thanks of the Academy were voted to Miss Adeline S. 

 Tryon for her generosity in satisfying a mortgage of $5,000 on a 

 property devised to the Conchological Section by her brother, Mr. 

 George W. Tryon, Jr. 



A committee consisting of Messrs. Xolan, Montgomery, Sharp, 

 Pilsbry and Fox was appointed at the request of the representative 

 of the committee on the proposed international catalogue of scien- 

 tific literature, to consider the preliminary announcement, and to 

 advise as to the desirability of the provisions and methods em- 

 bodied therein. The committee presented a report March 28, 

 1899, which was adopted and ordered to be forwarded as the 

 action of the Academy. 



The lecture hall and library were used for the annual meeting of 

 the American Ornithologists' Union, tha most successful, it is 

 believed, in the history of the society, and for the first autumn 

 ession of the Pennsylvania Library Club. 




534 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



Miss Harriet M. Wardle was appointed a Jessup Fund student 

 under the provision for females made by the late Mrs. Bloomfield 

 H. Moore as an addition to the trust endowed by her father. 



A committee has been appointed by the President, at the in- 

 stance of the American Philosophical Society, to represent the 

 Academy at a meeting to be held in commemoration of the late 

 Dr. D. G. Brinton, who held the position of Professor of Ethnol- 

 ogy and Archaeology in the Academy from February 25, 1884, 

 until his death. 



The Anthropological Section, not having held sessions or pre- 

 sented a report during the preceding twelve months, was, under 

 the By-Laws, declared at the meeting of the Academy held 

 December 27, 1898, to be no longer in existence.

REPORT OF THE CORRESPONDING SECRETARY. 



During the past year, commencing December 1, 1898, there 

 have been received from one hundred and ten societies, museums, 

 libraries, etc., one hundred and eighty-six acknowledgments of 

 the receipt of the publications of the Academy, and from forty -four 

 societies, libraries, etc., fifty-six notices that their publications 

 have been forwarded to the Acadenry. Fourteen applications for 

 exchange and for supply of deficiencies in sets of the Academy's 

 publications, logether with eleven circulars and invitations to the 

 Academy to participate in congresses or meetings, and seven an- 

 nouncements of the deaths of scientific men, have also been 

 received, and when necessary, answered. 



The deaths of twelve correspondents have been recorded. 



Four hundred and twenty-nine acknowledgments of gifts to 

 the library have been forwarded. 



Respectfully submitted,

Two hundred and forty-nine volumes have been bound, nearly 

 all at the expense of the special funds. A much larger appropria- 

 tion than is at present available for this work is a pressing necessity. 



The additional shelving supplied by nine new cases on the entrosol 

 floor has measurably relieved the crowding in the English and a part 

 of the German sections of the library of periodicals and journals. 

 The remaining portions still remain so crowded as to make the 

 contents difficult of access. It is hoped that additional room may 

 be secured during the coming year. 



About five hundred volumes of industrial and miscellaneous 

 reports, in no way related to the natural sciences, were, by direc- 

 tion of the Council, transferred to the Free Library, where they 

 will be placed at the service of those interested in them, thus in- 

 creasing their usefulness and making available the space occupied 

 by them for the arrangement of works of more importance to the 

 Academy. 



Like ends were secured by the printing and distribution of a 

 catalogue of the duplicate books which had been accumulating for 

 years. The fist embraces 1,154 titles of 1,061 volumes and 1,470 

 pamphlets. An intimation having been received from Washing- 

 ton after the issue of the catalogue that government publications 

 could not be thus disposed of by societies to which they had been 

 sent, all such volumes and pamphlets were withdrawn from sale so 

 as to prevent misunderstanding, although some of those on the list 

 were gifts from other sources than the departments of the govern- 

 ment and some were paid for by exchange. The sales, while not 

 very numerous, have much more than repaid the cost of printing 

 and distributing the list. 



With the cooperation of the Free Library of Philadelphia, a 

 transcript of our card catalogue of periodicals has been made as a 

 contribution to a proposed cooperative catalogue of journals in 

 the libraries of the city. The Academy's contribution consists 

 of upward of 2,500 titles, many of them not found in other 




538 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



collections. "When issued the work will be a most important con- 

 tribution to bibliography. It will not only inform the student of 

 sources of information, but also prevent unnecessary and often 

 expensive duplication, the possessions of one library being at the 

 service of the patrons of the others, of course under the rules 

 governing the several associations. 



The October meeting of the Pennsylvania Library Club was 

 held in the hall of the Academy. Your Librarian made a com- 

 munication on the history and resources of the library, concluding 

 with a short contribution to paleoutological history, which, while 

 not germane to the objects of the Club, seemed to interest those in 

 attendance. 



Dr. Sharp reports that the lantern slides of which he has charge 

 now number 980. The collection embraces subjects in all depart- 

 ments of natural history and furnishes most, desirable illustrations 

 for the courses of lectures delivered under the auspices of the 

 Academy. 



It again gives me pleasure to acknowledge the efficiency of my 

 assistant, Mr. William J. Fox. 



Edward J. Nolan, 



Librarian. 



REPORT OF THE CURATORS. 



The general collections, with all the additions of the year in the 

 care of the Curators, are in an excellent state of preservation. 



A large amount of work has been accomplished since the last 

 report in rearranging the specimens in the old building. 



The dry invertebrates have been placed in new cases, so far as 

 they could be arranged therein, though some of the geographic 

 series have had to be temporarily stored in packing cases. The 

 display sei'ies has been cleansed and entirely relabelled. 



The remaining cases in the upper gallery have been removed 

 from the damp walls, which have been whitened, thus securing 

 additional light. 



The many large specimens of minerals formerly displayed in the 

 gallery have been placed in a case on the first floor where they 

 have been labelled and arranged to much better advantage. 



On the floor devoted to the mammals in the new building, a new 

 mahogany and plate-glass case has been provided for the Carnivora, 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 539 



and another large one for Ungulates through the Mary Jeanes 

 Fund, while another case of similar character has been presented by 

 Dr. Francis W. Lewis for the reception of birds on the upper floor. 



Four large storage case3 have been provided for mammal skins, 

 and placed oji the fifth floor of the new building. 



In the department of Archeology, Mr. Clarence B. Moore has 

 presented one upright mahogany case with plate-glass sides and 

 shelves, and one horizontal case for the accommodation of his 

 rapidly increasing collection, and Dr. Dixon has provided a show- 

 case for the display of certain human remains. 



Besides these additions, considerable work has been done in 

 improving the building, the entire vestibule on Race street having 

 been repainted, and the lavatories all completely renovated, and 

 modern fittings introduced. 



Through the liberality of Mr. Clarence B. Moore, our museum 

 has, for the first time in its history, been thrown open to the public 

 on Sundays between the hours of one and five o'clock. This inno- 

 vation has met with popular approval, the attendance of visitors 

 being very large, and composed mainly of persons who would 

 otherwise have been unable to view the collections. 



The progress in adding to, rearranging, classifying, labelling and 

 caring for the collections during the year has been satisfactory. 



The Conservators of the several Sections have devoted much time 

 to the care and classification of the specimens in their respective 

 departments. Valuable work has been performed by Dr. H. A. 

 Pilsbry in the Conchological ; by Messrs. Thomas Meehan and 

 Stewardson Brown in the Botanical ; by Dr. Henry Skinner, Dr. 

 Philip P. Calvert and Mr. Charles Liebeck in the Entomological, 

 and Messrs. Lewis Woolman and Theodore D. Rand in the 

 Geological departments. 



Rev. L. T. Chamberlain, special Curator of the Isaac Lea col- 

 lection of Eocene Mollusca, has continued to add valuable mate- 

 rial during the year, bringing the total number of entries up to 

 5,161. Dr. Chamberlain has now enlarged the scope of the col- 

 lection to include the Oligocene. About one hundred and sixty 

 species from the Vicksburg and Red Bluff" horizons have been 

 already incorporated, while much foreign Oligocene material, 

 not yet labelled, is on hand. He proposes to send a collector 

 to the principal exposures to procure new material. Mr. C. "W. 




540 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



Johnson has continued his work on the collection, completing the 

 arrangement of the Eocene material. 



Mr. Theodore D. Rand, special Curator, has spent much time 

 in the arrangement and cataloguing of the William S. Vaux 

 collection of minerals. These services are more specifically set forth 

 in the reports of the several sections. Important service has also 

 been rendered by Mr. Witmer Stone, assistant to the Curators, in 

 all departments of the museum, especially in that of Ornithology. 

 Assistance in the arrangement and care of the collections has also 

 been received from the students of the Jessup Fund. Mr. H. W. 

 Fowler has made a systematic study of many of the families of 

 fishes in the collection, and identified a large number of unlabel - 

 led specimens. Mr. E. G. Vanatta has done excellent work on 

 the mollusca and other invertebrates ; Mr. S. H. Hamilton on the 

 minerals and Mr. A. F. Satterthwait on the insects. 



The additions to the collections during the year have been 

 important. 



The valuable Hoopes collection of North American Birds renders 

 the Academy's matei'ial in this department equal to any in the 

 Avorld. A series of American birds presented by Dr. S. W. 

 Woodhouse contains much of historic interest. 



The collection of local fishes i-eceived from Mr. H. W. Fowler, 

 comprising several thousands of specimens, is a valuable accession, 

 containing in large series many forms previously but poorly repre- 

 sented in the museum. 



The series of painted casts of American snakes presented by Mr. 

 Clarence B. Moore is equal to any other such representation of 

 Ophidia in this country. 



The Zoological Society of Philadelphia has presented many 

 valuable specimens, the mounting of which by the Academy's 

 preparator illustrates strikingly the advance in taxidermic art, 

 when compared with the objects formerly composing the cabinets. 



Specimens have been loaned during the year to Lewis Woolman, 

 F. L. Scribner, G. A. Boulenger, J. M. Coulter, G. S. Miller, 

 H. M. Smith, W. H. Osgood, T. Waylaud Yaughau, Robert 

 Ridgway, H. C. Oberholser, J. Dwight, Jr., R. H. Howe and C. 

 E. Lochman.

REPORT ON THE WILLIAM S. VAUX COLLECTIONS. 



The Curator of the William S. Vaux Collections -would respect- 

 fully report that a rough list of all the species in the collec- 

 tion, with the number of specimens iu each, has been prepared, and 

 that a fair copy of it is being transcribed in a book to be kept as 

 a catalogue. In addition to this, a large number of labels have 

 been corrected. The additions to the collection have numbered 

 but twenty-seven, but some of them are very tine specimens, 

 particularly two of barite, one of fluorite and one of rhodo- 

 chosite, said to be the finest ever found. 



A great deal more time than the present Curator can possibly 

 give to it, ought to be spent upon this valuable collection to make 

 it as nearly perfect as possible. He desires to acknowledge the 

 valuable assistance of Mr. George Yaus, Jr., in the procuring of 

 specimens, and in advice, and of Mr S. Harbert Hamilton in the 

 cataloguing, etc. Respectfully submitted, 



Theodore D. Raxd, 



Curator. 



REPORT OF THE BIOLOGICAL AND MICROSCOPICAL 



SECTION. 



The Section has held ten meetings during the year with the usual 

 average attendance. 



A large Beck binocular microscope, with outfit of numerous 

 objectives and accessories, was received by bequest, for the use of 

 the Section, from the late Dr. Joseph J. Kirkbride. 



Numerous communications were made during the year, and the 

 following papers and communications were presented at the meet- 

 ings of the Academy: 



" Evolution of the Microscope," by Dr. J. Cheston Morris. 



" Diatomaceous Deposits at the Mouth of Pensauken Creek," 

 by Messrs. Lewis Wool man and C. S. Boyer. 



" Nematode Worms," and " The Oyster Crab," by Dr. Ben- 

 jamin Sharp. 



" Sewage Poisons," by Mr. Holman. 



" Parasites of the Oyster," by Mr. T. S. Parvin. 



" On the Structure of Diatoms," bv Mr. T. C. Palmer. 




542 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



The communications of importance made to the Section were 

 by Mr. F. J. Keeley, on the spectrum analysis of diatomine, on a 

 Holothurian Parasite by Dr. J. C. Morris, and on observations of 

 various material contributed by Mr. S. A. Schumo, Mr. John A. 

 Shulze and Mr. Lewis Woolman. 



The following officers were elected for the ensuing year: 

 Director, .... J. Cheston Morris, M.D.

REPORT OF THE COXCHOLOGICAL SECTION. 



The main activity of the Conchological Section, as in former 

 years, has been expended upon the continuation of the Manual of 

 Conchology, which has now reached the thirteenth volume of the 

 second series. The Conservator has been chiefly occupied during 

 the year with the revision of the family Bulimulidm, the work on 

 American species being now completed, the specimens relabelled 

 and returned to the museum. 



Various changes have been made in the museum, the principal 

 one being the removal of the land shells of the United States 

 (excepting Succinea and Pupa) from the gallery to the study 

 room on the library floor. This collection was formerly crowded 

 into thirty -six drawers under the cases of fresh -water shells, and 

 had long since outgrown the space available. It now occupies 

 eighty -one drawers, leaving the space formerly used for the expan- 

 sion of the fresh-water shells. 



The accessions to the museum number about 4,000 trays aud 

 bottles, including many species new to science, as well as a larger 

 number new to our collection. None of this material has been 

 purchased, and but an inconsiderable part was obtained in ex- 

 change, nearly the whole having been sent by correspondents of the 

 Section in America and abroad for identification, or with the under- 

 standing that it be worked up, or to further the work in progress 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 543 



in the Manual of Concholocjy. It will therefore be seen that 

 much time must be devoted to this work, in order to keep the 

 collection of the Academy abreast of others able to purchase 

 freely. Among the more important accessions may be mentioned 

 a large series of land and fresh-water shells collected by Mr. S. N. 

 Rhoads in Florida and Mexico, a series of Samoan Opisthobranchs 

 collected and given by Mr. ( '. N. E. Eliot, and a valuable lot of 

 exotic slugs, given by the Rev. A. B Kendig, adding greatly to 

 what is now by all odds the largest collection of slugs in America. 

 The collection made by Mr. Rhoads, obtained in exchange for 

 identification, contains the types of some twenty-five new species. 

 That of Mr. Eliot the types and figured specimens. 



Dr. J. C. Cox, Mr. H. Suter, Dr. H. von Ihering and others 

 have continued their gifts of foreign mollusks, while the American 

 series has profited by the sendings of about seventy -five persons, 

 among whom Rev. E. H. Ashmun, Prof., T. D. A. Cockerell, 

 Messrs. George H. Clapp and L. N. Frierson may be mentioned 

 as contributing material of especial value. 



The Conservator, in company with Dr. Montgomery and Prof. 

 Couklin, made a collection of marine invertebrates in Biscayne 

 Bay, Florida, and later made a vacation journey to the Great 

 Smoky Mountains. A very large collection of the mountain 

 mollusks was made, including some rare and new forms of exces- 

 sively restricted range. Mr. J. H. Ferriss has contributed a valu- 

 able series from mountain localities south of those visited by myself. 



The Conservator acknowledges valuable assistance received from 

 Mr. C. W. Johnson, of the Museum Committee, and has also 

 been aided throughout the year by Mr. E. G. Vanatta, whose 

 efficient work deserves high commendation. 



The officers elected to serve during the ensuing year are as follows : 



Director, ..... Benjamin Sharp, M.D. 



Vice- Director, .... John Ford. 



Recorder, Edw. J. Nolan, M.D.

REPOKT OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SECTION. 



During the present year the regular meetings of the Section have 

 been held and the average attendance was twelve persons. The 

 verbal communications have been of interest and have had scien- 

 tific value. The collections have been cai'ed for ami are in a good 

 state of preservation. Many specimens have been acquired both 

 by purchase and donation; the more important being the 

 Griffith collection of exotic Coleoptera, numbering 10,000 speci- 

 mens purchased from the heirs of the late Dr. H. G. Griffith ; 

 donations from H. A. Pilsbry, 212 specimens from Florida and 

 Tennessee; E. G. Vanatta, 460 specimens from Maryland; Dr. 

 A. D. Smith, J. E. and G. Farnurn, 103 specimens from Man- 

 churia; R. Weber, 93 specimens from Palestine; H. Skinner, 178 

 specimens from Utah; H. W. Wenzel, 150 specimens from Penn- 

 sylvania and New Jersey. The Academy has purchased two hand- 

 some mahogany cases for the plaster casts of butterflies presented 

 by Mr. C. H. Hutchinson. The Entomological News, the journal 

 of the Section, has been continued, and the volume for the year 

 completed with 304 pages and six plates. One member has died, 

 and three associates were elected. 



The Section needs more room space, and a Conservator who can 

 devote all his time to the exacting work required to care for the 

 collections and incorporate the large amount of new material con- 

 stantly being acquired. At the annual meeting held December 28, 

 the following officers were elected for the year 1900: 



Director, ...... Philip Laurent. 



Vice-Director, . . . . . H. W. Wenzel. 



Treasurer, . . . . . E. T. Cresson. 



Conservator and Recorder, . . . Henry Skinner, M.D.

REPORT OF THE BOTANICAL SECTION. ] 



The slow but steady progress that has marked the history of the 

 Botanical Section for several years still continues. The meetings 

 have been held at the regular stated periods, distinguished botau- 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 545 



ists have been present, and communications of interest received 

 and discussed. Field meetings in connection with allied societies 

 in the city have been found of much value in bringing together 

 those with a community of interest. 



The proposition to raise §20,000 as a herbarium fund in mem- 

 ory of our lamented fellow -member, John H. Redfield, reached 

 about one-fourth of the amount ; arrangements were being made 

 to increase the fund, when it became desirable for the Academy 

 to make a strenuous effort to raise money for another purpose. 

 Not to divide the interest it was thought best to defer the Section's 

 effort. It is, however, pleasant to record that from this fund the 

 collections of C. C. Pringle for the past three years have been 

 secured. Contributions of specimens have been made by Steward- 

 son Brown, C. F. Saunders, William M. Canby and Anna C. 

 Hartshorne. 



The genera formerly composing the North American herbarium 

 have been brought into proximity with the same genera in the 

 general herbarium. The plants are still kept in their separate 

 genera covers, but the present arrangement favors comparison. 

 This work has been accomplished by the Conservator, aided by Mr. 

 Uselma C. Smith. The North American herbarium has been 

 enriched by the fine herbarium of the late Mr. William Wynne 

 Wister, a gift from his family. The specimens are in an admir- 

 able state of preservation. 



The work of mounting and verifying the specimens in the gen- 

 eral herbarium, assumed by the Director since the death of Mr. 

 Redfield, has reached only a few orders beyond those recorded last 

 year, the Director having given the season chiefly to labelling, 

 mounting and distributing the collections long on hand. Schlech- 

 ter's South African plants, Sharp's Arctic plants, and the mag- 

 nificent collections by Bang in Bolivia, have thus become an inte- 

 gral portion of the herbarium. 



In the early part of the summer Prof. Gandoger offered to 

 exchange a copy of his unique work, the Flora of Europe, in 

 twenty-seven volumes, for its value in North American plants. 

 The Section has never had the time to arrange for such exchanges. 

 In this instance Mr. U. C. Smith generously undertook to collect 

 from botanical friends nearly 1,200 species of plants required. 

 35 




546 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1899. 



They were properly labelled and shipped, and the volumes received 

 in exchange have been transferred by the Botanical Section to the 

 library of the Academy. 



At the annual meeting in December the following officers were 

 elected to serve for the ensuing year :

Report of Conservator. — In making his report for the year, the 

 Conservator of the Botanical Section is pleased to be able to state, 

 that the work in the herbarium has been carried on in the usual 

 satisfactory manner, though the amount accomplished has been 

 necessarily limited. 



The rearrangement of the herbarium, referred to in last year' a 

 report as in progress, was completed in the early part of the present 

 year, bringing all the flowering plants, with the exception of some 

 special collections, together in the two rooms on the library floor. 

 This arrangement will be found of great convenience to those 

 making use of the herbarium for comparative study. 



The work of mounting the general herbarium has been con- 

 tinued during the year, the specimens being prepared and names 

 verified as usual by Mr. Meehan. The additions received have 

 been the herbarium of the late William Wynne Wister, presented to 

 the Academy in the early part of the year by his family, and com- 

 prising several thousand plants, mostly North American. The speci- 

 mens are all in an excellent state of preservation and will make 

 an interesting addition on account of containing specimens from 

 many localities in or around the city, which have now been de- 

 stroyed. 



Six hundred specimens of Mexican plants have also been added 

 through purchase from the interest of the Redfield Fund, together 

 with about three hundred specimens of Pennsylvania plants from 

 Pike and Somerset counties, presented by Messrs. C. F. Saunders

and Stewardson Brown, a number of North American plants 

 from Mr. William M. Canby, and one hundred and fifty California 

 plants from Miss Anna C. Hartshorne. 



Were more time at the Conservator's disposal it would be an 

 easy matter to materially increase the herbarium as well as library 

 through the medium of exchanges as is done in other institutions, 

 and it is to be hoped that some arrangement may be effected in the 

 near future that will make this possible. 



The Conservator wishes to express his thanks to the members of 

 the Section in general and to Messrs. Thomas Meehan and Uselma 

 C. Smith in particular for the valuable assistance rendered during 

 the year. 



Respectfully submitted, 



Stewardson Brown, 



Conservator. 



REPORT OF THE MINERALOGICAL AND GEOLOG- 

 ICAL SECTION. 



The Director of the Mineralogical and Geological Section would 

 respectfully report that nine meetings of the Section have been 

 held during the year, with a marked increase of interest and of 

 value in the communications. 



The Section is especially indebted to Dr. Florence Bascom, of 

 Bryn Mawr College, who gave a lecture on the minerals of rock 

 sections, illustrated by excellent slides shown by electric light, 

 through the courtesy of the Franklin Institute, at its hall, the 

 polariscope being furnished without charge by Messrs. Queen & Co. 



Two interesting and largely attended excursions were made, one 

 to Doylestown, Buckingham Mountain, and New Hope, the other 

 to Bridgeport, Henderson Station and Port Kennedy. 



Additions to the museum have been less than usual. It is wor- 

 thy of consideration whether this may not be due to the fact that 

 a large part of the collection formerly displayed is now where it 

 cannot readily be seen. It is hoped that when means can be 

 secured for the better display a greater interest may be developed.

REPORT OF THE ORNITHOLOGICAL SECTION. 



The ornithological collections of the Academy remain in practi- 

 cally the same condition as last year, lack of cases still preventing 

 the removal of the main exhibition series to the new building, 

 where it is eventually to be displayed. This collection has, how- 

 ever, been carefully examined during the year and the specimens 

 in each family systematically arranged, which adds materially to the 

 ease of consulting them. 



The Delaware Valley Club collection has been largely increased 

 and entirely relabelled, full information being given regarding each 

 specimen, and a card added, on which the distribution and abun- 

 dance of each species in Pennsylvania and New Jersey are described. 

 The Club has met regularly during the year at the Academy, and 

 on November 13-16, 1899, the American Ornithologists' Union 

 held its annual congress in the building. This is the first time 

 that a congress has been held in Philadelphia, and it is gratifying 

 to know that the attendance of members and the number of papers 

 presented was greater than on any previous occasion. 



The most important accession during the year has been the 

 Josiah Hoopes Collection of North American land birds, which 

 was already on deposit, and which has now been purchased by 

 friends of the Academy. 



This collection of some 8,000 specimens renders the Academy's 

 series of North American land birds nearly complete, and adds a 

 large number of species heretofore lacking. 



The Fowler collection of Pennsylvania and New Jersey birds has 

 been added to the Stone collection already deposited, and being 

 rich in water birds the two form a very complete local study series. 




1899.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 549 



Dr. S. W. Woodhouse also presented a valuable collection 

 formed by him many years ago, which contains much of historic 

 interest. 



The main collection of skins has been carefully examined during 

 the year, and found to be in an excellent state of preservation. 

 Better accommodations are, however, badly needed for a number 

 of families of Old World birds which are temporarily stored in 

 packing cases, but which should be arranged in air tight tin cases 

 to ensure their safety. 



The Conservator wishes to acknowledge much assistance from 

 Mr. H. W. Fowler, student of the Jessup Fund, and to Mr. J. A. 

 G. Rehn, who has throughout the year voluntarily given his assist- 

 ance in the care and arrangement of the ornithological collections. 



The collections have been very extensively consulted during the 

 year, and many specimens have been loaned to ornithologists in 

 other institutions. 



At the annual meeting of the Section, held December 18, 1899, 

 the following officers were elected :
