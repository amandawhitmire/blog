PROCEEDINGS 



or THE 



ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES 



OF PHILADELPHIA. 



January 3d y 1854. 

 Mr. Lea, Vice-President, in the Chair. 



Letters were read : 



From Baron J. W. Yon Miiller, dated Brussels, Nov. 23d, 1853, 

 transmitting the works announced this evening, and also making en- 

 quiries respecting the feasibility of establishing a Zoological Garden in 

 Philadelphia. 



From Prof. John Le Conte, of Athens, Georgia, acknowledging the 

 receipt of his notice of election as a Correspondent. 



From Mr. Isaac Lea, dated Philadelphia, Dec. 30th, 1853, returning 

 acknowledgments for his election as a Vice-President of the Academy. 



A paper was presented for publication in the Proceedings, entitled 

 " On a new Entomostracan of the family Limnadidae, inhabiting the 

 Western waters. By Charles Girard." Beferred to Drs. Leidy, Bridges 

 and Buschenberger. 



A paper intended for publication in the Proceedings, entitled " On 

 the Ancient Alluvium of the Ohio Biver and its Tributaries, by Alfred 

 T. King, M. D.," was read and referred to Mr. Vaux, Mr. Lea, and Dr. 

 Buschenberger. 



Mr. Lea exhibited to the Academy a specimen of D'Orbigny's Acostcea giia- 

 d/casa?ia, which he owed to the kindness of that distinguished zoologist, during 

 Mr. Lea's visit to Paris last year. This genus he reminded the members was 

 identical with the Mulleria of Ferussac, as he formerly suggested, and was 

 afterwards satisfied to be the case on seeing the original specimen, described by 

 Ferussac in 1823, which is now in the fine collection of Mr. Delesert in Paris. 

 Mr. Lea stated that although the specimen figured by D'Orbigny had quite a 

 length of stem connecting the young portion of the shell, the Anodonta form, 

 with the mature portion, the Ostrea form, yet this was not necessarily or uni- 

 formly so. In the case of his own specimen this was very different. It hap- 

 pened, as is sometimes the case with the genus Ostrea, a. dead valve was filled up 

 by a subsequent living individual ; and on close examination, there were really dis- 

 covered to exist two specimens of the Anodontiform age ; one on the old single 

 valve at one end, and another on the reverse end appertaining to the living speci- 

 men, having the epidermis on it perfect. Neither of these specimens had a stem,

but advanced directly from the form of the Anodonta to that of the Ostrea, 

 leaving the young beaks directly on the edjje of the valves. Mr. Lea thought 

 that the difference of length of the stem, or the absence of it in various specimens 

 arose from the fact of the young individual finding sooner or later something 

 solid to commence the soldering of the under valve to, and then to spread out 

 the area of the valve. 



On motion, so much of the communication of the Baron Von Milller' 

 as relates to the establishment of a Zoological Garden in this city was 

 referred to the following Committee : Mr. Ord, Mr. Vaux and Dr. 

 Bridges. 



January 17 th. 

 Vice-President Bridges in the Chair. 



A letter was read from Capt. John H. Ritchie, U. S. N., dated Phila- 

 delphia, Jan. 10th, 1854, accompanying the donations to the Museum 

 acknowledged at last meeting. 



Also a letter from J. Pemberton Hutchinson, Esq., dated Philadel- 

 phia, Jan. 16th, 1854, acknowledging the receipt of his notice of elec- 

 tion as a Member. 



Mr. Conrad presented for publication in the Journal, a Synopsis of 

 the Genera Parapholas and Penicilla ; which was referred to Dr. Ruschen- 

 berger, Dr. Le Conte and Dr. J. A. Meigs. 



Mr. Lea exhibited a large and beautiful crystal of limpid quartz, cut 

 into facets, which he had obtained in Italy. 



On leave granted, the Committee, to which was referred Baron 

 Miiller's communication relative to the establishment of a Zoological Gar- 

 den in this city, presented a report adverse to the same, the Committee 

 being firmly impressed with the opinion that the project would not succeed, 

 from " the difficulty of procuring a suitable locality, of convenient access, 

 within the city or its precincts ; the great amount of capital required in 

 the outset of the undertaking, and the precarious nature of the tenure, 

 in this country, of all that depends upon popular favor." 



The Report was adopted, and a copy directed to be transmitted to 

 Baron Miiller.

 Vice-President Bridges in the Chair. 



Major Le Conte presented a paper, for publication in the Proceedings, 

 entitled " Notice of American Animals formerly known, but now for- 

 gotten or lost." Referred to Mr. Cassin, Dr. Ruschenberger and Dr. 

 Henderson. 



On leave granted, Mr. Foulke, after stating that it was probable the 

 U. S. Government would fit out shortly an Expedition for the explora- 

 tion of Africa, suggested the appointment of a Committee to urge 

 upon the Government the propriety of having Naturalists attached to 

 the Expedition. Whereupon on motion the following was adopted :

 The Committees to which were referred the following papers, severally 

 reported in favor of their publication in the Proceedings : 



On a new Entomostracan, of the family LimnadidjE, inhabiting the Western 



waters. 



By Charles Girard. 



LIMNADELLA, n. g. 



Gen. Char. Eye one. Antennae subequal, provided upon their inferior side 

 with long and plumose setae, whilst on the upper side there are short, slender 

 and simple spines. Two elongated tape-shaped jaws. Eeet in twenty-lour 

 pairs, provided upon their extremities and sides with slender and plumose setae, 

 or hairs. A series of spiny processes along the posterior half of the dorsal line. 

 Post abdominal plate very large. Nutritive system phlebenteric. 



Observations. This genus diners from Limnadia in being provided with one 

 eye only, instead of two. Also by its antennae, the two pairs of which are 

 similar in structure, whilst in Limnadia one pair is smaller than the other. The 

 post abdominal plate and number of feet will afford other distinguishing charac- 

 ters between Limnadella and Limnadia. From Cyzicus or Estheria it differs, 

 first, by the structure of the shell, which in Estheria resembles that of an Area, 

 whilst, in Limnadella, it is altogether Cyproid in its general aspect. There 

 is a marked difference between these two types in the structure of the an- 

 tennae, the joints of which are provided on their upper part with numerous spines 

 in Limnadella, whilst in Cyzicus there is but one single spine at the anterior 

 edge. The structure of the feet is likewise dissimilar, being furnished with 

 plumose setae in Limnadella. 



Limnadella Kitet, n. sp. 



Spec. Char. Shell : elongated, subelliptical, thickest anteriorly ; twice as 

 long as deep ; anterior, inferior, and posterior margins regularly continuous ; 

 upper outline somewhat irregular on account of the beaks being rather promi- 

 nent. Valves uniformly convex. Greatest depth one eight of an inch, greatest 

 length one quarter of an inch. Specimens may occasionally attain to a larger 

 size. Color, deep or light brown, mottled with black. Animal : antennae 

 composed each of twelve or thirteen subequal joints. Twenty-four pairs of 

 feet, the six posterior ones diminishing gradually away so as to render the last 

 three rudimentary. The last of all is inserted upon the last caudal segment but 

 one. There is a broad sub-triangular plate, terminated by two pairs of very large 

 spines, curved upwards; the inferior pair being longer and slenderer than the up- 

 per one. The concave margin of that plate is furnished with a series of quite 

 small spines. On the uppermost part of the post-abdominal plate is inserted a 

 pair of very delicate sword shaped appendages, very difficult to be observed 

 even with a good microscope. Along the posterior half of the back there exists 

 a series of sixteen processes, provided upon their upper and posterior sides with 

 about five or six minute curved spines, the tip of which is bent backwards. 

 The anterior two of these processes are but rudimentary ; the most developed 

 occupy the middle of the series; the posterior ones again diminish gradually as 

 they approximate the post-abdominal plate. 



Specimens collected at Cincinnati were sent to the Smithsonian Institution by 

 Thomas Kite, of that city.

On the Ancient Alluvium of the Ohio River and its Tributaries. 



By Alfred T. King, M. D., of Greensburgh, Pa. 



The Ohio River, and all its tributaries which I have examined, are bounded 

 by an ancient alluvial deposit, rising from one to two hundred feet above the 

 present beds of those streams, and extending from half a mile to nearly two 

 miles in width. 



In the brief description which I design to give of these deposits I shall com- 

 mence with that extensive and remarkable one at the mouth of the Beaver 

 River. 



This is a beautiful and romantic stream, rising in the northern part of Beaver 

 County, Pennsylvania. It runs nearly south, and empties into the Ohio river 

 about thirty miles below Pittsburgh. At its mouth are two small towns, 

 Rochester on the east and Bridgewater on the west. The town of Beaver, which 

 is the seat of justice of Beaver county, is situated on the hill immediately above 

 and west of Bridgewater, on an alluvial plain, two miles and a half in length, 

 one mile, or nearly so, in width, and one hundred and thirty feet above the bed. 

 of the Ohio, stretching along the northern shore of that river. Although wells 

 have been sunken, in different parts of the town, 128 or 130 feet, which would 

 be about on a level with the bed of the Ohio, still no one has penetrated through 

 this deposite. The strong probability is, therefore, that it extends many feet 

 beneath the present bed of the river. On the opposite side of Beaver river this 

 deposite stretches along the Ohio, about three quarters of a mile. At both ex- 

 tremities it is apparently transferred to the opposite side of the river, in conse- 

 quence of the present curving of the stream, which causes the water to impinge 

 against the base of those lofty hills which everywhere skirt the shores of this 

 picturesque river. Seldom does the Ohio, or any of its numerous and mighty 

 tributaries, flow through the centre of this ancient alluvium, for this deposite is 

 seen every now and then on opposite shores. 



On the eastern side of Beaver river this deposite is 20 or 30 feet higher than it 

 is at the highest point on Beaver plain, w hich would make it there about 150 or 1 60 

 feet, above the bed of the Ohio. At the most eastern extremity the hills are com- 

 posed of fine sand and loam, containing fluviatile and terrestrial shells of the genera 

 A?iodo?ita, Unio, Planorbis, Paludina, Limnea and Helix. Nearly the whole of 

 the residue of this deposit at Rochester, Bridgewater and Beaver, is composed 

 of nodules of argillaceous oxide of iron, and of rounded, polished river pebbles, 

 from the size of gravel to the size' of a man's head and upwards. 



At the town of Rochester, the Pennsylvania and Ohio Railroad Company has 

 made an extensive cut of about eighty feet through this mass of iron nodules 

 and river pebbles. Here it exhibits symptoms of stratification. Commencing 

 at the summit, there is first a thin seam, which composes the surface soil, of 

 sandy loam, then loose pebbles, below which there is a seam of eight or ten 

 feet of conglomerated pebbles cemented together with an oxide of iron. So- 

 firmly bound together are these pebbles, that the workmen, when making the 

 cut, were obliged to blast them, and I am told that they encountered much 

 more difficulty than they ordinarily do in more solid, compact rock. Below this 

 is a seam of ignitable bituminous coal, about one inch and a half in thickness, 

 extending entirely through the cut, and always preserving the same relative 

 position. Below this coal were loose pebbles again, and so on, alternately, from 

 the summit to the base. 



Doubtless this tendency to stratification in alluvial, as well as in marine de- 

 posites, may be accounted for that streams at different periods transport different 

 materials, but the continuous seams, and vast masses of hydrate of alumina, 

 frequently seen in alluvial bluffs, particularly in those of the Mississippi river, 

 and the pure crystals often seen imbedded in solid sedimentary rocks, clearly 

 indicate the existence of chemical affinity between some of the particles of 

 sediment, in connection with mere mechanical deposition. 



Beaver river is a small stream, not larger than the Mohawk, but its scenery 

 is exceedingly beautiful. Its calm and placid bosom reflects vividly like a 




1854.] 5 



mirror the tall mountain cliffs, and the magnificently variegated scenery of the 

 autumnal landscape. The deep gorges and dark precipitous ravines which cut 

 transversely the lofty hills which rise like mountains on each side, and the broad 

 alluvial plains which bound its shores, lined for miles with beautiful towns and 

 villas, where the sound of cheerfulness and the hum of industry are everywhere 

 heard, render the scenery exceeding interesting and picturesque. 



From the mouth of this river to the town of New Brighton, a distance of 

 about three miles, the alluvium is composed principally of pebbles, resembling 

 those already described. Here it is about one hundred and fifty feet in depth, 

 at the highest point, and about three quarters of a mile wide. From this point 

 to a distance of from ten to fifteen miles above, this deposite is strewed over 

 with immense masses of transported angular rocks, derived from the neighboring 

 hills. These rocks are of all sizes, and, in places, very numerous, strewed 

 about in every direction, and piled upon each other in the most irregular manner. 

 There are several enormous piles of these quartzose rocks, or coal grit, about 

 eight or ten miles from Rochester, lying upon the brow of a hill, which over- 

 looks the river, and more than two hundred feet above its present bed. Some of 

 these masses will weigh thousands of tons. 



There is one w r hich is probably in situ, which will measure twenty feet in 

 height, and over one hundred feet in circumference, much shattered below, where 

 it is grooved, rounded, and smoothed by the long continued action of running 

 water. This rock presents a singular aspect to the observer who attempts to 

 account for its present form, and its relative position with the river below. It 

 is surrounded by huge but smaller masses of the same character, all exhibiting 

 the same wearing and polishing action of running water, and piled upon each 

 other in the wildest confusion. 



I descended with Dr. Barker, of Beaver, who kindly accompanied me, this 

 precipitous hill, along a narrow and winding path to the river below. All the 

 way we passed over and around similar piles of rocks, and for miles above this 

 point found a similar condition of things to exist. Most of these rocks are dis- 

 tinctly traceable to their parent hills, still higher up the stream. 



The enormous size of some of these transported rocks, and the unequivocal 

 evidence of the wearing action of running water upon them, indicate that they 

 were carried by a long continued, turbulent and impetuous stream, which had 

 been, previous to this exhibition of its maddening fury, in a comparatively quiet 

 and placid condition, during which time the subjacent alluvial sediment, before 

 described, was deposited. It may be proper to mention here, that in connection 

 with these angular masses of quartzose grit, I found, not unfrequently, syenitic, 

 granitic, porphyritic, greenstone boulders, &c, &c, which were exceedingly 

 hard, rounded and polished, similar to the more common quartzose pebbles. The 

 largest which I saw connected with the angular rocks w T ould not weigh more 

 than a few hundred pounds. But about three hundred feet above the head of 

 little Beaver creek, a tributary of the Ohio river, and about twelve miles 

 from the locality I am now describing, there are boulders of granite and other 

 primary rocks lying upon the summit of a hill, which will measure thirty 

 feet in circumference. 



Indeed the hills, which here contain the enormous cannel coal vein of from 

 fourteen to eighteen feet in thickness, are strewed over with boulders of primary 

 rocks, and the diluvial scratches and groovings are visible in places. These 

 hills are, in some places, 300 feet high. 



At different points along Beaver river, and at heights of more than a hundred 

 feet above its present bed, I observed convincing indications of the grooving, 

 smoothing and polishing action of running water, on the solid sandstones of the 

 adjacent hills. These workings were unquestionably produced by the river 

 when it flowed over this alluvial plain. 



The same kind of markings I observed in the hills which skirt the shores of 

 the Ohio. About fifteen miles below Pittsburgh, at a place called the Narrows, 

 I observed, at the height of more than a hundred feet above the river, the solid 

 sandstones polished and grooved, as if channelled by the moulding instrument of 

 a joiner, and even pot holes are worn into their sides. 




6 [January, 



Nearly the entire cities of Pittsburgh, Allegheny and Cincinnati are built 

 upon this remarkable deposite. 



From Pittsburgh to Wilkinsburg, seven miles east, it is seen stretched along 

 the northern shore of the Monongahela river, and nearly two miles in width. 

 To this remarkable locality I will now briefly direct attention. 



Passing from Greensburgh to Pittsburgh, along the turnpike, it will be observed 

 that the last anticlinal roll of the Allegheny chain of mountains is at Grapeville, 

 four miles west, and the last synclinal trough, which is but imperfectly formed, 

 is about three miles further west. From this point the beautiful undulations 

 which are so characteristic of the Allegheny chain, die away, and the rocks 

 assume nearly a horizontal position. Their horizontality, however, is only appa- 

 rent, for they really rise, at an almost inappreciable angle, westward. From 

 this point to within seven miles of Pittsburgh the general geological and topo- 

 graphical structure of the country remains nearly the same. 



At the summit of the hill, which overlooks the town of Wilkinsburg, standing 

 upon the limestone which is super-imposed upon the great Pittsburgh seam 

 of coal, the observer beholds, more than a hundred feet beneath him, a beautiful 

 and extensive alluvial plain, bounded on the north by hills, which separate it 

 from the Allegheny river valley, and which contain the coal and limestone to 

 which allusion has just been made, and on the South by the Monongahela river. 



The whole of this great seam of coal and the incumbent limestone, to the 

 depth of three hundred feet, have been swept away by a process of denudation, 

 and their places partially supplied by an alluvial deposite over one hundred feet 

 in thickness, and about the same height over the present bed of the Monongahela 

 river. 



As the Pennsylvania Railroad passes over this deposite I shall avail myself of 

 the measurements which are given in one of the last annual reports of the Com- 

 pany. 



The elevation of the Ohio river at Pittsburgh, above tide, is given at 700 

 feet. The elevation above tide at Wilkinsburg is 922. There would, there- 

 fore, be a difference of tidal elevation between Pittsburgh and Wilkinsburg of 

 222 feet. After substracting 22 feet feet for the fall of the river between these 

 two points, we would have 200 feet for the depth of the deposite. 



If we assume that the shale and limestone upon which this vast deposite re- 

 poses, and which will be presently described, are from 200 to 300 feet beneath 

 the Pittsburgh seam of coal, we will be enabled to form some idea of the enor 

 mous denuding process, by which this river excavated its channel, and after- 

 wards deposited upon its ancient bed, in some places, over two hundred feet of 

 sedimentary matter. This is, of course, only an approximative estimate ; but 

 from all the data which I have been enabled to procure, the average depth may 

 be safely assumed at from one hundred to two hundred feet. 



In consequence of the great depth of this deposite at Wilkinsburg, I, at one 

 time, conjectured that the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers met, at some 

 antecedent period, and formed the Ohio, either at this point or at East Liberty, 

 which are from five to seven miles East of their present junction. To satisfy 

 myself on this curious point, I crossed the plain at Wilkinsburg, three quarters 

 of a mile, to the base of those lofty hills which separate the two great alluvial 

 valleys, and found that the whole region was composed of river pebbles, sand 

 and loam, with which were mingled fluviatile and terrestrial shells. 



Near the Frankstown road, which is nearly two miles in a straight line from 

 the Monongahela river, I saw some men excavating a well. They had gone 

 down to the depth of twenty or thirty feet, and had passed through nothing but 

 pure river sand and pebbles, meeting occasionally only with an Anodonta or a 

 Unto. 



Near this point I crossed the dividing hills, and descended along a narrow 

 path to the road which winds along the bank of the Allegheny river. Here I 

 found this ancient deposite presenting: nearly the same appearances, and of about 

 equal magnitude to the one on the Monongahela side. In the neighborhood of 

 Laurenceville it is of great breadth, and of not less than two hundred feet in 

 hickness. 




1854.] 7 



The hills which separate these Two ancient alluvial valleys are a continuous 

 chain, and of sufficient altitude to constitute an effectual barrier to the mingling 

 of the waters of these two rivers, at any point nearer than their present con- 

 fluence at the city of Pittsburgh- I observed at Rochester, New Brighton, and 

 at different points along the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers, that this deposite 

 reposes on a dark colored shale, sometimes passing into more compact slate. As 

 I was descending a hill on the Frankstovvn road, near East Liberty, I discovered 

 an old acquaintance, a thin stratum of calcareous rock, on which the shale re- 

 poses, and which in contradistinction to other limestones, belonging to the coal 

 series I have denominated the ^rj^a-limestone. 



This is a somewhat peculiar rock, characterised by containing a vast number 

 of small bivalve shells, belonging to the genus Atrypa, etc. When long exposed 

 to the atmosphere, its external surface readily disintegrates, and presents a rag- 

 ged and shaly appearance, the surface being covered with small Atrypa and pro- 

 jecting joints of Encrinites. 



In some localities I have found in this rock the genera Terebratula, Trilobites, 

 Plei/.rotomaria, Productus, Spirifer, Bellerophon, Euomphalus, Ammonite and 

 Orthoceratite. But the joints of Encrinites and the small Atrypa are the charac- 

 teristic fossils, and distinguish it from all other limestones belonging to the car- 

 boniferous series. This limestone, in Westmoreland county, is seldom found 

 more than two or three feet in thickness. But near the Ohio line I found it over 

 ten feet, it being there a very compact and durable rock, well adapted for agri- 

 cultural and other purposes. It is exposed at numerous points in Western Penn- 

 sylvania, and uniformly presents similar lithological and paleontological cha- 

 racters. 



I mentioned, at the commencement of this paper, that this ancient alluvium 

 was traceable everywhere along the Ohio river and its tributaries which I have 

 examined, and doubtless along those which I have not so closely surveyed. Those 

 tributaries to which my attention has been more particularly directed, are the 

 Beaver, Allegheny, Monongahela, Youghiogeny, Kiskeminitas, Loyalhanna and 

 Conemaugh rivers, etc., etc. But in the brief and necessarily imperfect delinea- 

 tion of these remarkable deposites, which I have attempted to give, I have con- 

 fhied myself to a few localities only, leaving a more extended and minute 

 description for some future period. 



It is not at all improbable that those high bluffs which bound the vast alluvial 

 valley of the Mississippi river (which is from thirty to fifty miles in width), 

 were deposited at the same period. Also the alluvial terraces on which the city 

 of Cincinnati is built, the highest of which is 120 feet above the level of the 

 Ohio river; and doubtless the natural terraces and ridizes of Lake Erie and 

 Ontario, which were so graphically delineated by Mr. Charles Whittlesey, of 

 Cleveland, in the July No., 1850, of the American Journal of Science. 



For, in all these localities, fossil teeth and other bones of the mammoth and 

 mastodon have been found imbedded in this deposite. These animals, which 

 were once the lords of the creation, the primates of this lower world, perished 

 and became extinct in that last grand revolution, during which I presume these 

 ancient sedimentary deposites were slowly and gradually elevated to their pre- 

 sent position, and which immediately preceded the advent of man. 



From the whole of this investigation my mind has been convinced that 

 the relative position of the rivers and this ancient alluvium through which 

 they now pass, or along whose borders their waters deeply flow, has changed 

 since the period of deposition. But when, and in what manner, or by what 

 cause, are questions not so readily answered as proposed. 



The hypothesis of local oscillations, first proposed many years ago by Sir 

 Charles Lyell, to account for the deposition of the Rhenish loess, will, with 

 slight modifications, I believe, clearly explain all the phenomena connected with 

 this post tertiary formation. 



Indeed, from the numerous facts upon which this hypothesis is based, it may 

 be regarded as an exceedingly plausible theory, if not a legitimate induction. 



It has lonj; been ascertained that various parts of the earth's surface are now, 

 and perhaps ever have been, undergoing slow and gradual oscillatory movements. 




8 [January, 



Parts of Sweden, Norway, and the shores of the gulf of Bothnia, have been 

 long gradually rising. Also extensive regions of South America have been 

 undergoing a slow but gradual upheaval, during a period of many centuries. On 

 the other hand, the gradual sinking of the coast of Greenland, for the space of 

 more than six hundred miles, during the last 400 years, has been more incon- 

 trovertibly established by actual markings and critical examinations made by 

 the most astute minds. 



Large portions of the earth's surface have been suddenly upheaved, whilst 

 others have as suddenly subsided. 



The whole coast of Chili was suddenly elevated several feet by the earth- 

 quake of 1822, producing terrible commotion in the sea, and sending vast waves 

 over the ocean, which doubtless transported huge masses of rocks many miles 

 from the shore. 



In 1611, an earthquake sank the town of New Madrid, on the Mississippi 

 river, several feet beneath the waters, the vibrations of which continued three 

 months. 



Many other facts of an analogous character might be adduced, but these are 

 sufficient to show that various parts of the crust of the earth are now under- 

 going oscillations, and that it is not at all improbable that the hydrographical 

 basin of the Ohio may have undergone, at some remote period, similar move- 

 ments. 



First we may suppose that there was a gradual subsidence during a period, 

 perhaps, of many centuries, of the whole hydrographical basins of the Ohio and 

 Mississippi rivers, and even extending beyond che limits of their tributary 

 streams. This depression of the land would necessarily lessen the fall of the 

 waters into the Gulf of Mexico, and increase the alluvial deposite. After a cer- 

 tain indefinite period we can readily suppose that this process of subsidence was 

 reversed, and the whole as gradually upheaved, until the rocks were brought 

 to their present altitude, when the oscillation ceased. 



During this slow upward movement the waters would necessarily cut their 

 channels through the alluvial deposite, which had been thrown down during the 

 process of subsidence. 



At the commencement of this upward movement we may suppose a sudden 

 upheaval to have occurred in Beaver county, somewhat analogous to that on the 

 coast of Chili, in 1822, which would produce such commotion and recoil of the 

 waters in Beaver river as to cause them to impinge, with terrific force, against 

 the projecting rocks of the adjacent hills, rive them asunder, and pile thein 

 as they are now found, over its ancient alluvial bed. 



Afterwards, the process of elevation may have been as gradual as that of the 

 shores of the Gulf of Bothnia, which amounts only to two or three feet in a 

 century. 



In corroboration of this view I may mention, that although the rocks are 

 nearly horizontal, yet the hills which skirt the shores of this beautiful 

 stream are often seen cracked from the base to the summit, and the strata, in 

 places, much disturbed. 



Also, the dark, yawning gorges, and broad and deep ravines, cutting entirely 

 through the hills, indicate, I think, that the rocks here of the ancient coal 

 measures have undergone great disturbance since the period of their original 

 deposition. 



Notice of American Animals, formerly known, but now forgotten or lost. 



By John Le Co.nte. 



The writers of the last century have left us descriptions of several animals 

 which modern research has not since been able to detect. In looking over the 

 works of these authors, who favored the world with their knowledge so long 

 ago, it necessarily happens that we find their descriptions more or less imper- 

 fect, either from the insufficient manner in which they were made, or from that 

 brevity of expression which was then fashionable in natural science. Hence 




1854.] 9 



has arisen much confusion and indecision. I have selected from these writers of 

 a former age, the following animals which appear to have heen then well known, 

 but are now forgotten or overlooked ; I beg leave to call the attention of natur- 

 alists to this subject, with the hope that they may be all found and accurately 

 described, or else struck out from the number of those enumerated among the 

 productions of America. 



Felis rufa, or Bay Cat of Pennant, Arc. Zool., vol i. p. 51. 



With yellow irids, ears erect, tufted with black long hair; color of the head, 

 body, and outside of the legs and thighs a bright bay, obscurely marked with 

 dusky spots; the forehead marked with black stripes, from the head to the nose; 

 cheeks white, varied with three or four incurvated lines of black; the under 

 and upper lip, belly, and inside of the legs and thighs white, the inside of the 

 upper part of the fore legs crossed with two black bars ; the tail short, upper 

 part marked with dusky bars and near the end with one of black, the underside 

 white; fur short and smooth ; twice the size of a common cat, (that is 27 inches 

 long,) said to come from the interior of New York: probably erroneous. Described 

 by Mr. Pennant from the living animal. 



The common wild cat of our country, found in all the northern, southern, and 

 western states, has in latter years been confounded with this species ; I think, 

 however, they cannot but be distinct. Mr. Pennant, the best naturalist that 

 England has ever produced, could never have confounded two animals so dis- 

 similar. It is true, in describing one, he had before him the living animal, in 

 the other a dried skin, but of the last, he could examine hundreds. He certainly 

 could not have mistaken the indistinct brownish grey of the one for bright bay, 

 nor could the last color have faded into the other. 



The common wild cat, however, never should have been called Felis rufa, 

 even if it was identical with Pennant's animal, as Ray had described it in his 

 Synopsis Methodica Animalium, p. 169, as Catus montanus. If these two ani- 

 mals are the same, why has the name given so long even before the birth of 

 Pennant, been discarded, in defiance of the rule of priority in nomenclature ; 

 when it was last described, it was easy to restore the name of montanus. A 

 just regard for the name of Ray, if nothing else, surely demanded this. 



A description follows of the Felis montana, as I knew it in Georgia, made 

 from numerous specimens either living or recently killed, including probably 

 every variation to which the animal is liable. 



Felis montana. Mountain Cat, Pennant, Arc. Zool., vol. i, p. 51. Catus mon- 

 tanus, Ray, Synops. Method. Animalium. 



Above, hair mixed dusky, and pale brown, top of the head brown striped lon- 

 gitudinally with dusky, cheeks with dark brown, back with dusky ; the last 

 sometimes wanting. Irids yellow, ears black, upright, and slightly pencilled, 

 especially during the winter; with a broad, transverse, cinereous bar. Cheeks 

 on each side with a large semicircular tuft of long hair. Legs spotted with dark 

 brown, sides most frequently obscurely spotted with the same, sometimes, how- 

 ever, not spotted; chin and throat white, with a black stripe on each side, form- 

 ing an angle ; sometimes these stripes are wanting, or very faintly marked in 

 pale brown. Belly, inside of the thighs, and hind part of the fore legs whitish, 

 spotted with black. Tail, above, generally very faintly annulate with brown; 

 these rings often disappear; tip black, beneath white, which color appears on the 

 upper part at the tip, whenever the hair is in any way disturbed. Feet beneath 

 dusky or dark brown. 



Mean length of 12 specimens 31 inches, tail 6. 



I have given the foregoing very full description, that it may be compared with 

 the preceding. Most of the marks which are common to the two, belong to al- 

 most every species of the genus Felis. I add two obscure species, of which but 

 little is known. I am not willing to pronounce them distinct from each other or 

 from the montana, without farther examination. The first was seen in Califor- 

 nia by my son, and the description and measurements were made by him ; the 

 other is extracted from Lewis and Clarke's travels. 




10 [January, 



Californian Wild Cat : 



Above, mottled white, black, and fuscous, lighter on the sides, which are 

 slightly barred; beneath, white; legs fuscous, with black bars, much more dis- 

 tinct on the anterior ones, which are anteriorly white. Ears large, rounded, 

 black, with a white spot connected with the mastoid part, tip with a short tuft. 

 Tail short, blunt, barred with darker, tip black with an extreme white point. 



Length 31 inches, tail 6, head 4.5, height 1.5. 



Lewis and darkens Wild Cat : 



Larger than the wild cat of the United States; color of the back, neck, and 

 sides reddish brown, irregularly varied, with small spots of dark brown, tail two 

 inches long and nearly white, except the extremity which is black; it terminates 

 abruptly, as if amputated. Belly white, variegated with small black spots, legs 

 of the same color as the sides. The back is marked transversely with black 

 stripes; ears black, on the outer side covered with short fine hair, except at the 

 upper part, where it is furnished with a parcel of fine, straight, black hair three- 

 fourths of an inch long. The hair of the animal is long and fine. 



This animal was called by Rafinesque, Felis fasciata. I have declined adopt- 

 ing his name, as he never saw it, and was too much in the habit of describing 

 things by hearsay, with as much confidence as if he had himself procured them, 

 and had them lying before him. A drawing or an engraving was sufficient for 

 him to make a new genus from, as was often the case, I am sorry to say, with 

 authors of more credit. 



Both Charlevoix and Dupratz, mention a species of Felis in Louisiana, which 

 appears not to have been lately seen ; they call it Pichoux; the following is a 

 description of it 



Pichoux : 



Upper part of the head, neck, back, sides, shoulders, and thighs bright tawny, 

 face striped downwards with black, shoulders and body marked with stripes and 

 large oblong black spots, the legs with small spots, breast and inner side of the 

 legs and thighs whitish, spotted with black ; tail long, marked with black, taw- 

 ny, and grey. 



Size of a common cat, (about 18 inches). 



Does not appear to be the Felis pardalis, from its smaller size, and probably 

 different markings, besides being in some of the under parts white. If this ani- 

 mal is no longer found in Louisiana, it is highly probable that it may be met 

 with in Texas or New Mexico. Animals at one time extremely common in any 

 particular country, will suddenly leave it without any visible cause. As an in- 

 stance of this : previous to the year 1820, no bird was more common in that part 

 Georgia where I resided, than the Conurus Carolinensis or Parakeet. They would 

 pass through the air in flocks of from 50 to 100. They suddenly all disappeared, 

 and for more than thirty years, not one has been seen where they were so abun- 

 dant. Travellers through Texas and New Mexico, would do well to look for 

 this beautiful species of cat. 



The Chat sauvage, described by Dupratz, vol. ii., p. 93, is an animal well 

 worth enquiring about. He thus describes it : 



Chat sauvage : 



He says that it does not feed on animal substances, but on fruits, bread, and 

 other vegetables. It seems that it w r as easily and often tamed. It is gentle and 

 frolicsome, and not more than 8 or 10 inches high and about 15 long. The head 

 like that of a fox : when tamed the color is grey ; when wild, red : its paws have 

 long toes and short claws ; it has improperly been called a cat, as it has nothing 

 of the cat about it but its activity, and bears a greater resemblance to the 

 marmot. 




1854.] 11 



Silvery Fox, of Louisiana, Penn. I. c, p. 48. 



With a fine and thick coat of a deep brown color, overspread with long silvery- 

 hairs of a most elegant appearance. They differ from most other American 

 species in their habit of burrowing. The description is borrowed from Dupratz, 

 vol. ii., p. 92. 



This can hardly be the Canis velox. 



Pennant in Supp. to Arctic Zoology, p. 52, mentions a whitish grey fox, no 

 larger than a hare, common among the Archithinne Indians, 4000 skins of 

 which have been brought in one year to the British factories. 



The Comanche Dog : 



Common among the Comanche Indians. Naked, except a few stiff hairs about 

 the mouth. This dog is mentioned by Clavigero, vol. i., p. 56, as an inhabitant 

 of Mexico, called by the natives Holoitzuicintli. It is remarkable that though 

 some of these dogs have been brought within the United States, we have no 

 description of them : they are quite large, being upwards of two feet high, and 

 used by the natives for hunting. Here is an instance of the absurdity of those 

 writers who state, that climate has an influence in altering the appearance of 

 animals ; thus they tell you that the so-called Turkish dog, which is hairless, 

 has been made so by its progenitors living for numerous generations in a warm 

 climate ; now here we see an animal equally naked, which inhabits the moun- 

 tains and cold steppes of the south-west. Of a similar character is the assertion 

 that sheep lose their wool in the Southern States, and in the West India Islands. 



The Water Rat of Pennant, 1. c, p. 130. 



With small eyes, ears covered with fur, teeth yellow, body covered with long 

 black hair, mixed with a few of a rust color, belly of a deep grey. 



A Mouse of Louisiana : 



Mentioned by Dupratz. Not larger than Mus musculus, of a very bright bay. 



These are all the mammals which I can collect, as worthy of being called im- 

 perfectly known, or rather lost to modern naturalists. I now proceed to consider 

 the Birds. 



Vultur sacra : Bartram's Travels, p. 150. 



The head and neck are bare of feathers nearly down to the stomach, where 

 the feathers begin to cover the skin, and soon become long and of a soft texture, 

 forming a ruff or tippet, in which the bird, by contracting his neck, can hide that 

 as well as the head ; the bare skin on the neck appears loose and wrinkled, which 

 is of a very deep bright yellow color, intermixed with coral red as it approaches 

 the yellow of the sides and fore part. The crown of the head is red; there are 

 lobed lappets of a reddish orange color, which lie on the base of the upper man- 

 dible. But what is singular is, a large portion of the stomach hangs down on the 

 breast of the bird, in likeness of a sack or half wallet, and seems to be a dupli- 

 cature of the craw, which is naked and of a reddish flesh color, this is partly 

 concealed by the feathers of the breast, unless when it is loaded with food, and 

 then it appears prominent. The plumage of the bird is generally white or cream 

 colored, except the quill feathers of the wings and two or three rows of the co- 

 verts, which are of a beautiful dark brown; the tail which is large and white, is 

 tipt with this dark brown or black, the legs and feet are of a clear white ; the 

 irids golden ; the pupil black. 



The tail was used by the Seminoles as a war standard. Dupratz, vol. ii., p. 

 109, mentions this bird under the name of White Eagle, and says that the Indians 

 in whose neighborhood he lived, the Natchez, used the feathers for adorning their 

 pipe of peace. 



Ferruginous Woodpecker : Pennant, 1. C, p. 271. 



With a dusky bill, the crown and pendant crest of a pale yellow ; a crimson 

 bar extends from the mouth along the lower part of the cheek. The cheeks, 




12 [January, 



back, and coverts of the wings are of a'deep ferruginous color, lower part of the 

 back of a pale yellow ; primaries ferruginous, barred on their inner webs with 

 black. 



Sent from South Carolina to Mr. Pennant, by Dr. Garden ; therefore there can 

 be no doubt of its having been obtained near Charleston, although no one has 

 ever seen it since. The high character of both these gentlemen forbids us to 

 suppose that there was any deception on either side, either in sending the animal 

 to Europe, or in its habitat. 

 The Florida Pheasant : 



Mentioned at page 20 of Stork's introduction to John Bartram's Journal of 

 Travels in East Florida. 



I have had described to me a bird, which must have been this, as inhabiting 

 the hummocks on the banks of St. John's River, but I never had the good fortune 

 to meet with it. 



Norton Sound Bustard, Penn. vol. iii., p. 321. 



A Captain Rich informed Mr. Pennant, that at Norton's Sound, in latitude 

 64 30', he had seen great flocks of a large bird which were very shy, ran very 

 fast, and for a considerable way before they took wing, so that he could never 

 get one shot. 



Black Ibis, Bartram's Travels, p. 148. 



Black on the upper side, breast and belly white, legs and beak as white as 

 snow. Size of Ibis alba. 



Red-billed Heron, Pennant, Supp., p. 65. 



With a red bill. Irids yellow, legs green, plumage white. 



There are many of the smaller birds of America described by Pennant, that I 

 am convinced are not now known, and many more that have lately been de- 

 scribed as new species, that were well known to the English naturalist. Not 

 being, however, sufficiently acquainted with the ornithology of our country, I 

 cannot, without devoting too much time to the subject, determine which they 

 are. It has all along been the custom with American naturalists, entirely to 

 neglect everything that this illustrious man and elegant scholar has written on 

 the subject of our animals; but it would be a labor well repaid by the thanks 

 of every lover of science, if any one would go over his Arctic Zoology, and give 

 us the scientific names of every thing which he has described. 



There remain only a few reptiles to be added to this list : there can be no dif- 

 ficulty in obtaining them if they really exist, and I cannot see how any one can 

 doubt of their existence. A very little attention on the part of persons living 

 where they are said to be found, would soon make us acquainted with them. 



Trionyx, of Bartram. Travels, p. 177. 



They are flat and thin, two and a half feet in length, and eighteen inches in 

 breadth across the back ; in form resembling the sea tortoise, the whole back 

 shell except the vertebrae or ridge, which is not at all prominent, and ribs on each 

 side, is soft and cartilaginous, and easily reduced to a jelly when boiled ; the an- 

 terior and posterior extremities of the back shell appear to be embossed with 

 round horny warts or tubercles ; the belly or nether shell is but small and car- 

 tilaginous, except a narrow cross bar connecting it at each end with the back 

 shell, which is hard and osseous ; the head is large and clubbed, of nearly an 

 oval form, the upper mandible is however, protruded forward and truncated, 

 somewhat resembling a swine's snout, at the extreme end of which the nostrils 

 are placed ; on each side of the base or root of this proboscis are the eyes, which 

 are large. The upper beak is hooked and sharp like a hawk's bill ; the lips and 

 corners of the mouth large, tumid, wrinkled and barbed with long pointed warts 

 which can be projected or contracted at pleasure, which gives the creature a 

 frightful and disagreeable countenance. 



Inhabits St. John's river, Florida. 



It is a remarkable circumstance, that although this tortoise is found as it were 

 at our very doors, no one has ever seen it since the venerable author of the pre- 




1854.] 13 



ceding description noticed it in his travels. There can be no doubt of its exist- 

 ence in St. John's river of Florida, and that it can be obtained at any time. 

 Although it is represented in the figure attached to the description with five 

 claws on all the feet, this does not detract from the truth of the account. If this 

 be an error, I attribute it to his not having made a complete drawing of it at the 

 time when he first saw it, and afterwards having finished it from memory ; from 

 this may have resulted the error, if there is one. Although I do not see any more 

 difficulty in a Trionyx having claws on all his toes, than in a Cistudo having 

 three claws when it has five toes j in this case there is a subtraction, in the 

 other an addition. It has been said that this wa3 an incorrect and exaggerated 

 figure of the Trionyx spiniferus (spinifer) of Lesueur. Nothing can be more 

 absurd than this assertion. Lesueur's species has on the front part of the cara- 

 pace a series of small pointed warts not easily discoverable, while Bartram's 

 animal has larger extensible and contractile tubercles on the head and neck. I 

 remember when it was much the custom to ridicule Mr. Bartram, and to doubt 

 the truth of many of his relations. For my own part I must say, that having 

 travelled in his track I have tested his accuracy, and can bear testimony to the 

 absolute correctness of all his statements. I travelled through Florida before it 

 was overrun by its present inhabitants, and found every thing exactly as he re- 

 ported it to be when he was there, even to the locality of small and insignificant 

 plants. Mr. Bartram was a man of unimpeached integrity and veracity, of 

 primeval simplicity of manners and honesty unsuited to these times, when such 

 virtues are not appreciated. 



Apalone hudsonica, Rafinesque, Annals of Nature, p. 3. 



Upper shell rounded-elliptical, fiat, entire, soft, with a small anterior keel, 

 yellowish with brown spots, and a circular black line near the margin. Two 

 long oculated spots before and behind the eyes. Nose proboscidal; jaws with- 

 out a bill. Lower shell anterior. Body denudated behind. Tail obtuse, mu- 

 cronate, shorter than the shell. Five palmated toes to all the feet, with small 

 claws. Length 2 to 6 inches. 



Found in the Hudson river between the falls of Hadley, Glen, and Baker, and 

 further up to the source. Called Mud Turtle. 



Although this description was published long ago by Rafinesque, no one, that 

 I know of, has ever thought fit to look for the animal. Now, although Rafin- 

 esque was certainly insane and apt to see and describe things w r hich had no real 

 existence, yet when his descriptions appear full and complete, and his localities 

 accurately specified, it certainly is worth while to look for the objects he pro- 

 fesses to have seen. Why do not some of our young naturalists take such things 

 in hand ? Advancing age forbids me. 



The slender Lizard, Penn. Supp., p. 86. 



About eight inches long, as slender as a crow-quill; head small, tail blunt and 

 of equal thickness ; body marked from head to tail with lines of pale brown and 

 black, belly lead color ; top of the nose and tail white. 



Salamandra. 



1 once saw, and indeed had in my possession, a Triton or Salamandra, which 

 was sent from New Orleans, of which the following is a short description. I add 

 it in this place because it was a most extraordinary animal. 



Dusky, speckled with yellowish white, and inclining to blown on the belly ; 

 everywhere except on the belly and tail covered with small warts, so as to re- 

 semble shagreen; tail blunt, with a narrow fin wrinkled longitudinally and trans- 

 versely so as to appear striated and articulated. Length 5 in. .75. 



The preceding are all the animals which I can find that have once been more 

 or less particularly described, but of which at present no one knows anything. I 

 might have added to the list many that have been described by Rafinesque, but 

 the most of them appear in their coloring, as well as in other characteristics, so 

 opposed to everything known of congeneric species, as to render it extremely 

 probable that the author was laboring under some delusion when he published 




14 [January, 



them. It is well known that he was in the habit of describing things which he 

 never saw, and in his eagerness to claim a priority in discovery, to describe the 

 same object two or three times over under different names. 



It is to be hoped that the reading of these few pages will turn the attention of 

 naturalists in the Southern and Western States to the investigation of the few 

 species pointed out as forgotten or lost, and that we will not remain long with- 

 out knowing whether they have a real existence. 



The Committee on Mr. Conrad's " Synopsis of the Genera Paraph ol as

Descriptions of some new Coleoptera from Oregon, collected by Dr. J. G. Cooper 

 of the North Pacific R. R. Expedition, tinder Gov. J. J. Stevens. 



By John L. LeConte, M. D. 



The following species were contained in a collection recently made by Dr. 

 Cooper, and kindly placed in my hands by Prof. Baird. The total number 

 of species collected was nearly 70; among which are specimens of Omus 

 De j e a n ii and Audouini. Among the described species, not before noticed 

 in our territory, is Ancylochira L a n g i i, (Buprestis Langii, Mann.) and 

 among species also found on the Atlantic side of the continent, Haplochile p y g- 

 maea, Lee {Morio pyg. Dej.), Clytus undulatus Say, Monohammus s c u- 

 t e 1 a r i s Say, Hispa v i 1 1 a t a Fabr., Eumolpus a u r a t u s Fabr., Galleruca 

 canadensis Kirby. 



This indicates, that notwithstanding the extensive collections which have 

 been made both in California and Russian America, the Coleoptera of Western 

 America are still comparatively unknown, and that consequently even small 

 .collectious made by travellers, who have but little time to devote to science, 

 will possess very great scientific value. 



Cicindela, n. sp. The thorax of the specimen has been destroyed, and the 

 species can therefore be made known only approximately, until the native species 

 of the genus have been properly arranged in systematic order. The species in 

 question seems most closely allied to C. longilabris Say, which it resembles 

 exactly in its markings, but the elytra are less deeply punctured, and of a dull 

 greenish bronze color; the apex is broadly rounded and finely serrate; the suture 

 is armed with a minute spine. The labrum is not longer than is usual in the 

 species of the genus, and entirely resembles in form C. 12-guttata, having only 

 one distinct tooth at the middle; the palpi (of the female) are black; the sculp- 

 ture of the head precisely as C. 12-guttata. 



Platynus, a species resembling P. obsoletus (Feronia obs. Say,) in every re- 

 spect except that the elytra are somewhat wider. I have not yet investigated 

 this genus sufficiently to pronounce upon the value of such a difference. 



Carabus oregonensis, cyaneo-niger thorace fere opaco, latitudine vix

 punctatis, foveis minus profundis serie triplici impressis. Long. -85. 



One male found at Prairie Paso. This species is closely related to C. taedatus 

 Fabr. (also found by Dr. Cooper,) but the thorax is proportionally smaller and 

 narrower and much more densely and finely rugose ; the rugosities of the head 

 are also smaller, and the impressions less deep ; the striae of the elytra and the 

 impressed foveas are all less marked. 



Calosoma aenescens, nigroaeneus, crassiusculus, thorace latitudine plus

 Long. .8- 



Both sexes, found at Fort Vancouver. This species is very'different from C. 

 tepidum and calidum by the thorax being less rounded on the sides and the pos- 

 terior angles being distinctly prolonged. To Callisthenes it approaches by its 

 form, but the wings are large, and the outer points of the antennae are entirely 

 pubescent. The spaces between the foveas of the elytra are also quite distinctly 

 elevated.

One specimen found between Fort Vancouver and Yokolt Plain, in July. This 

 species belongs to a group of species having the form of A. aurulenta and striata, 

 but differs from all the others known to me by having obsolete costae in the in- 

 tervals between the four ordinary costae, and by having an additional costa ex- 

 tending nearly from the apex to the base between the elevated suture and the 

 normal first dorsal costa. The head is entirely free from hair, and is uniformly 

 punctured ; the under surface of the body is bright coppery, tinged with green, 

 moderately punctured; the prosternum is broadly impressed between the coxae, 

 and is not hairy.

Abundant in Oregon, whence it has been brought by Dr. Townsend, Capt. 

 Wilkes' Expedition, Col. M/Call and Dr. Cooper. Resembles the brilliant 

 variety of A. striata, but is distinguished by its more robust form, and by the 

 costae of the elytra being impunctured. A variety occurs in which the elytra have 

 each a broad blue vitta, extending from the first to the third costa. The body be- 

 neath is coppery, somewhat hairy, and the antepectus is impressed between the 

 coxae ; the front has a narrow somewhat smooth medial line. 



Ancylochira radians, supra splendide'viridi-aurea, dense punctata fronte

 apice subtruncata. Long. *6, lat. -23. 



One specimen found at Fort Vancouver. It is with some hesitation that I 

 venture to describe this species as distinct : its general form is narrower than A. 

 lauta, and is very much that of A. striata: from the latter it differs by the 

 somewhat concave and pilose front. The pectus is as in the other species, but 

 is densely clothed with long white hair. The under surface is coppery golden, 

 more densely punctured than in the preceding. 



Ancylochira pl'acida, viridi-aurea, cupreo-tincta, confertissime punctata, 

 thorace latitudine fere duplo breviore, antrorsum subangustato, lateribus late ro-

Collected by the late J. K. Townsend, in Oregon, and given me by Mr. Will- 

 cox, as Phcenops placida of the Berlin museum. The form of body is more 

 cylindrical than in the other species known to me; the pectus is not canaliculate, 

 and the prolongation of the sternum is broader and more obtuse than in A. 

 decora, or the other species with which I have compared it. The insect, though 

 differing from Ancylochira in having the scutel slightly pointed behind, ap- 

 proaches much nearer to that genus than to Phaenops, and until a revision is made 

 of the genera of our native Buprestidae on more natural characters than have 

 been hitherto employed in their study, should be suffered to remain where I 

 have placed it.

Wenass river, to Fort Colville. It affords me great pleasure to dedicate this 

 fine species to Dr. Cooper, to whose taste for natural history we are indebted 

 for the present interesting collection. 



This species belongs to group (A b) of my synopsis of Meloides, (Proc. 

 Acad. 6, 334,) near L. vulnerata, but is very distinct by the reticulated elytra.

One specimen found between Fort Vancouver and Yokolt Plain, in July. Very 

 different from the two species mentioned on p. 20, by the more slender form and 

 elongate thorax; the dorsal channel is dilated and bifurcated towards the apex 

 and base of the thorax. 



Phymatodes aeneus, osneo-piceus, parcius pubescens, thorace latitudine bre-

Prairie Paso, July to August. This fine species seems intermediate between 

 Criocephalus and Asemum ; the eyes, although nearly as large as in the former 

 genus, are deeply emarginate; the antennae are hardly half as long as the body, 

 and pubescent. The discoidal excavation of the thorax does not extend much 

 in front of the middle.

 natis, abdomine sanguineo, basi obscuro ; subtus parcius longe pilosus, tibiis 

 intus dense pilosis. Long. *5 



One specimen, Wenass river to Fort Colville. The palpi and antennae are 

 destroyed: it is possible that this should form a separate genus, but the man- 

 dibles are emarginate at tip as in Crossidius, from which it seems to differ in 

 having the thorax obtusely armed at the sides, as in Purpuricenus. The upper 

 surface may have been hairy, as in C. testaceus, but the hair is now en- 

 tirely removed. The elevated lines of the elytra are hardly visible. 



Toxotus flavolineatus, niger, flavo-pubescens, thorace antice posticeque

Two specimens, one having the third joint of the antennae black, the other, 

 having it pale at the base, like the following joints : Fort Vancouver and Prairie 

 Paso. This species resembles very closely S. obliterata, but the thorax is 

 shorter and more dilated posteriorly; the impressions are much stronger, and the 

 disc is separated from the base by a sudden declivity ; the basal margin is also 

 yellow, and there is no trace of the two elytral spots before the middle ; the 

 apex of the elytra is not at all rufous. 



In the description of S. obliterata (Journ. Acad. Nat. Sc. 2d ser. 1, 328) the 

 testaceous sides of the thorax and the annulate antennas are not mentioned ; 

 they were overlooked on account of the dark color of the specimen from which 

 the description was made. 



Plectrura product a, nigro-picea, parce griseo pubescens, guttulis flavo-pu-

 tis, singulatim longe acuminatis, antennis annulatis. Long. 5. 



One specimen, Fort Vancouver. This species does not agree with the des- 

 cription of P. sprnicauda Mann. (Bull. Mosc. 1852, 366). The thorax has a 

 strong: lateral spine, with some smaller ones around it, as required in the generic 

 description, but the tips of the elytra are not crenulate; the smooth tubercles 

 form five series, of which only the outer one is entire; the others are imperfect, 

 containing only three or four tubercles each ; the sutural one is indistinct, the 

 second ends just behind the middle ; the third and fourth are abbreviated at each 

 end, commencing about one-third from the base, and ending at one-fifth from the 

 apex ; the scutellum and a little thoracic line anterior to it are more densely 

 pubescent, with yellow hair, than any other portions. 



Tetraopes oregonensis, niger, capite thorace elytrisque coccineis (pallide

 pone medium, scutelloque nigris, pedibus antennarumque articulo lmo coccineis. 

 tarsis, genubus, tibiisque posticis nigris. Long. -55. 



Wenass River to Fort Colville. This species has the form of T.femora- 

 t us Lee, but the thorax is still more dilated on the sides. From T. basalis 

 (the only other species known to me in which the base of the antennae is red) 

 it is easily known by the sudden elevation of the disc of the thorax. The 

 pubescence has been removed by the alcohol, and I am therefore uncertain 

 whecher the antennae are annulated. The black spots of the elytra are in the 

 usual position, but are very small, and, with the exception of the humeral one, 

 disappear entirely in many specimens. 



Coccinella subversa, hemispherica nigra, capite ante oculos albo (ore, cly-

This species resembles closely C. c a lifo r n i c a, but is smaller, and the 

 elytra are much more distinctly punctulate.

Prairie Paso. The ungues are acutely toothed, as in most species of the genus ; 

 the white triangular spot of the elytra is between one-fourth and one-fifth from 

 the apex, and is somewhat dilated along the margin in one specimen.

Fort Vancouver to Yokolt Plain. Of the species found in the Atlantic States, 

 this approaches most nearly toN. sexpustulatus; the thorax is almost pre- 

 cisely as in that species, but is more profoundly impressed j the margin is punc- 

 tured, the disc in one specimen is smooth, in the other obsoletely punctulate^ 

 The antennae are entirely black.

One specimen, Prairie Paso. This species closely resembles in appearance 

 N. marginatus, but the thorax is less narrowed posteriorly, and the depressed 

 margins are considerably broader, being, in fact, very much as in the preceding 

 species, or N. n i g r i t a.

Fort Vancouver ; collected also by the late J. K. Townsend. Somewhat 

 smaller and narrower than A. alternatus Say, and readily distinguished by the 

 different form of the thorax and by the entire absence of elytral striae. I have 

 adopted the name under which it is known in the Berlin Museum. 



I have several species of Curculionidae, from various sources, collected in Ore- 

 gon, but being unable to determine with certainty the genera to which they belong, 

 and being in truth not at all satisfied with the elaborate arrangement used by 

 Schonherr, I forbear describing them until I can bring them all together ; re- 

 flecting that more confusion may be produced by referring a species to an impro- 

 per genus, than by suffering it to remain undescribed. 



Synopsis of the CEde.meridje of the United States. 

 By John L. Le Conte, M. D. 



Although I can contribute but two new species, at present, to this small 

 family of Coleopterous insects, it seems desirable that a concise list of the 

 species already described should be presented, as the descriptions have become 

 somewhat scattered, and some of the species have been placed in wrong genera. 

 The trenera allied to Xylophilus are placed in this family by some entomologists, 

 but the association does not seem natural, and the species are therefore not in- 

 cluded in this synopsis.

For the complete synonymy of this species, which is found on both conti-

 The insect is most abundant in the vicinity of our cities, and has probably been 

 introduced by commerce. The synonymy omitted relates to its occurrence on 

 the eastern continent, and therefore has no place in our local fauna. Redten- 

 bacher very properly unites Nacerdes with Anoncodes.

Georgia: although resembling the next species in color, this is readily dis- 

 tinguished by the absence of elevated lines on the elytra, and by the basal joint

LABRIBJE. 



HERICHTHYS, B. and G. Body compressed ; outline subelliptical ; frontal 

 region convexe. Teeth small, subcorneal, simple, anterior row the most con- 

 spicuous. Lower lip entire. Five branchiostegal rays. Ventrals, dorsal and 

 anal fins acuminated ; caudal rounded. Five or six spiny rays to the anal. Scales 

 large ; lateral line interrupted posteriorly. 



Obs. This genus has strong affinities with Heros of Heckel, from which it 

 chiefly differs by the structure of tlTe anterior row of maxillary teeth, which are 

 simple, instead of bein^ provided with lateral hooks. The relative size of the 

 scales will likewise afford another generic feature of no small importance. 



8. Herichthys cyanoguttatus, B. and G. Head forming about two-sevenths 

 of the entire length. Snout subconical, detached from the frontal line by a de-

 teeth situated behind an anterior and more conspicuous row. Eyes rather lar^e 

 and circular, their diameter being contained four times and a half in the length 

 of side of head. Posterior part of cheeks scaly ; large scales on the opercular 

 apparatus. Anterior margin of dorsal situated in advance of the insertion of 

 ventrals; tip of posterior rays extending a little beyond the tip of those of anal. 

 Insertion of ventrals backwards of base of pectorals ; external soft ray much 

 longer than the others. The caudal forms about the two-ninths of the entire 

 length.

13. Catostojius congestus, B. and G. At first sight this species calls to mind 

 C. gibhosus, by its short and contracted shape ; it differs from it, however, in 

 the scales and form of the fins. The head is contained five times and a half in 

 the total length. The snout is blunt, abruptly truncated, and the mouth very 

 small. The eyes are large, subelliptical, and their longitudinal diameter con- 

 tained four times in the length of the head from the tip of snout to posterior mar- 

 gin of opercular apparatus. The dorsal fin is subquadrangular, its anterior mar- 

 gin being nearer to the tip of snout than to the base of caudal. The caudal is 

 semilunar, with the lobes rounded. The anal is narrow, its length less than the 

 half its height. The ventrals are inserted under the middle of the dorsal. The 

 tip of pectorals does not reach the base of ventrals.

The scales are large, there are fourteen rows across the line of greatest depth 

 of body. The lateral line, which runs straight along the middle of the side, 

 contains about forty-six scales. 



The color as preserved in alcohol is uniform reddish brown above, lighter be- 

 neath, sides silvery. The fins are all unicolored, and of the tint of the region 

 to which they belong.

14. Catostomus clarkii, B. and G. A rather small and short species, in shape 

 subfusiform and compressed. The dorsal line is gently arched. Head small, 

 subcorneal, truncated anteriorly, forming a little less than the sixth of the total 

 length of tbu fish. The eyes are subcircular, of medium size, their diameter 

 being contained about four times in the length of side of head. The mouth is 

 larger than in C. covgextus, and surrounded with more developed lips. The up- 

 per margin of dorsal fin is slightly concave, its anterior margin as high as long. 

 The caudal is subcrescentric posteriorly, with rounded lobes. The insertion of 

 the anal is narrow, its height is twice and a half the width. The insertion of 

 ventrals is under the posterior third of the dorsal. The pectorals are elongated 

 and of medium development.

 anterior margin being equi-distant between the tip of snout and the first rudi- 

 mentary rays of the upper lobe of the caudal. The latter is slightly concave 

 posteriorly, and the lobes rounded off. The base of the anal is contained nearly 

 three times in its height, and when brought backwards its tip extends to the ru- 

 dimentary rays of the inferior lobe of the caudal fin. The ventrals are inserted 

 under the posterior, third of the dorsal, bent backwards their tip does not reach 

 as far as the anus. The pectorals are of medium development, subovate, pointed 

 posteriorly.

Since the publication of several papers on Tertiary fossils, I have, with the 

 aid of more numerous works of reference, been enabled to rectify the nomen- 

 clature of some genera, selecting the earliest authority, whether the author had 

 published a diagnosis or only indicated a genus by refeience to atypical species.

Description of a new Dolium. 



~D. album. Oblong-suboval, with convpx ribs, which are closely arranged, 

 except on the shoulder; about 18 on the body whorl ; spire conical, with rounded 

 volutions, columella perforated at base; lip simple, margin acute. 



This species most nearly resembles D. penlix in form, but is proportionally 

 much narrower, with the ribs more distant and prominent on the shoulder, and 

 with a channel round the suture which the other does not possess. The spire is 

 less elevated, the species much smaller, and the color nearly white without spots. 



Description of a veto Conularia. 



C indentata. Elongated, quadrate, tapering very gradually, angles some- 

 what truncated and crossed by numerous indentations ; surface minutely granu- 

 lated by fine equal decussated iines. 



Locality. Galena, 111. IVlr. Germain. 



This species has distant septa, and the middle of each side has an obsolete, 

 slightly impressed, longitudinal line ; on the cast there are two carinated ap- 

 proximate linps, with an impressed line on each side of them.

Description of a new Bulimus. 



B. lineolatus. Oblong-ovate, thin, slightly umbilicated ; whorls 6, smooth ; 

 columella reflected, very narrow ; lip reflected, very thin and acute ; color white 

 and fulvous, variegated, with dark brown stripes , aperture more than half the 

 length of the shell ; spire conical. 



Inhabits Volcano of Cartago, Costa Rica. t 



This species approximates B. paziantis of D'Orbigny, but is more ventricose, 

 has a shorter spire, broader bands, narrower columella, and the lip is somewhat 

 reflected, which is not a character of the allied species. That shell has the 

 aperture less than half the length of the shell, whilst the other has it more 

 than half its length. 



Description of a new Alasmodonta. 



Subovate, thin, slightly contracted medially; umbonal slope rounded, slightly 

 ventricose ; ligament margin elevated ; posterior margin obliquely truncated, the 

 extremity subangulated and much above the line of the base ; epidermis oliva- 

 ceous, with a few obscure rays ; cardinal tooth single in the right valve, long, 

 compressed, elevated, triangular ; in the left valve widely trind, the posterior 

 lobe obsolete, and situated posterior to the apex; within bluish. Length If, 

 nearly ; height f.

N<ote ou the genus Amblychila, Say. 



By John L. Le Conte, M. D. 



In a small bottle of specimens of Coleoptera, collected in New Mexico by 



Major Sibley, U. S. A., recently sent me through my kind friend Prof. Baird, 



was fortunately contained a specimen of Amblychila; as some confusion seems 



-still to exist with regard to this very rare insect, a few remarks may not be out 



of place. 



Fort Union is about seventy miles E. N. E. from Santa Fe, and consequently 

 ear the base of the Rocky Mountains; it will be remembered that Say's speci- 

 men was also obtained near the same chain, although at a point farther north. 

 This fact, as well as the complete agreement of the specimen with Say's de- 

 scription, fixes it as an authentic type of A. cylindriformis. The outline (Plate 1) 

 wood cut appended to this note was made by Mr. W. Van Ingen, from a 

 drawing by G. G. White, and is very accurate in form. It will readily enable 

 'the necessary comparison to be made wilh the Californian specimen described by 

 Mr. Reiche, which I believe was afterwards purchased by Baron Chaudoir. 



On comparing the New Mexican specimen with Mr. Reiche's figure, (Am. 

 Ent. Sue Tr., vol. S, pi. 19, also copied into Chenus. Encyc. Hist. Nat.) several 

 important differences may be perceived: the head and thorax of his is propor- 

 tionally narrower, and in the enlarged figure of the head, the labium is repre- 

 sented as having a quite prominent tooth each side of the emarginate medial pro-? 

 longation, and the lateral angles are rounded; in mine, the labrum each side of 

 the prolongation is merely slightly sinuous, and the lateral angles are rectangu- 

 lar, so that the general outline each side of the middle is decidedly concave. The 

 'large punctures in the side figure seem to form a regular series between the 

 -costa and the suture, w T hile in mine they are distributed irregularly. 



In comparison with the description given by Mr. Reiche (1. c. p. p. 560), I 

 have only to say, that my specimen shows a quite decided brownish tinge on the 

 elytra, while the Californian specimen is described as entirely black; and that 

 the smaller punctures of the elytra are by no means obsolete. Mr. Reiche's re- 

 mark in the generic description, that the basal tooth of the mandibles is bifid, ap- 

 plies only to the right mandible : that of the left side has, it is true, a correspond- 

 ing prominence, but it is so small and so far back, as not to alter rhe outline in 

 any way, and therefore Mr. Reiche's observation tends to produce confusion.

I should not at all hesitate, therefore, to consider the Californian A. P i c c o- 

 1 o m i n i i as distinct from Say's species, were it not for the preposterous collar 

 which, in Mr. Reiche's figure, is appended to the base of the thorax, and for the 

 very inaccurate representations given by his draughtsman of the two species of 

 Omus found in Oregon, (I. c. 7, pi. 10.) Such figures might be excusable in 

 America, where artists have not yet turned their attention to objects requiring 

 such accuracy of delineation, but in parts of Europe where accurate figures have 

 been made, and as the yearly accessions to our scientific libraries show can still 

 be made, such figures as those published in the Annales above quoted, of Am bly- 

 chila and Omus, are hardly to be commended. 



Having found near San Francisco, in California, some specimens of Omus 

 californicus Esch., I avail myself of the present occasion to remark, that 

 it is very closely allied to O. A u do u in i Reiche, and in fact only differs by 

 having the head and thorax very densely and deeply wrinkled, and the punctures 

 of the elytra more equal in size : the appearance of rows of punctures jiiven in 

 the very wretched figure accompanying Eschscholtz' description (Zool. Atl. tab. 

 4, fig. 1,) and copied by Reiche (1. c. sup ) is hardly apparent. 



The epipleurae in Omus are narrow, and defined by an acute line, which unites 

 with the margin near the apex of the elytra. In Amblychila the epipleurae are 

 broad, and the defining elevated line becomes obsolete about one-fifth from the 

 tip. The discoidal costa is about the same length : the intermediate costa (called 

 by Say the marginal elevated line) is more elevated, and extends to about one- 

 seventh from the tip : the smaller punctures of the elytra become effaced 

 towards the tip, and the large ones (each of which bears a small elevated point,) 

 are somewhat more numerous.

 page 3, is my Limnadia coriacea, ib. 1, 184, for June, 1842. At that time I 

 doubted the propriety of placing it in Limnadia, chiefly on account of the dorsal 

 tubercles mentioned in my description, but I had no means of making the neces- 

 sary comparisons. It was discovered in great abundance in a road-side puddle, 

 subject to desiccation, and although I removed a number of them to a small pond, 

 I have never met with them since."

Synopsis of the species of Platynus and allied genera, inhabiting the United 



States. 



By John L. Le Conte, M. D. 



The species of the small group of Carabica, herein examined, are quite fre- 

 quently so closely related, as to be with difficulty separated ; some synonymy 

 too has been produced by the want of sufficient bibliographical knowledge on the 

 part of those who have investigated these genera. To lessen in some degree 




36 [April, 



the difficulty now resting over the subject, I have thought that a series of origi- 

 nal descriptions of all the species known to me, based upon a careful comparison 

 of their specific characters, might remove some of the obstacles encountered from 

 the different style of the descriptions of different authors. I do it the more gladly, 

 as an opportunity is thus afforded me of correcting many important errors into 

 which I was led, in some of my earlier writings, by the haste and inexperience 

 of youth, from the effects of which it falls to the lot of only the most favored of 

 men to escape. 



The reader will find, in some portions of this essay, a further development of 

 the principle announced by me in a synopsis of Silphales, (Proc. Acad. 6, 275,) 

 illustrated in a genus, of which the species are very numerous ; these species 

 form small groups, according to their respective affinities, and in general the 

 limits of each species are marked by well defined organic differences. But in 

 some of the groups, occur forms so closely allied as to present, with a large series 

 of specimens, almost imperceptible differences, by which sets of specimens, at 

 first sight readily recognized and separated, become linked together. These 

 variations (in form, not color) are frequently seen to be constant in those found 

 in one locality, and in the present condition of science, would seem to indicate 

 positively the origin at different points, or at various points intermixed together, 

 of organic forms, so closely related as not to present sufficient differences to be 

 regarded as ordinary species. 



Thus it is that Nature who, not only between her works, but between her 

 processes, continually displays gradations of sublime harmony, reveals to u,s~ some 

 of the steps between those genera in which absolutely distinct species are found 

 in restricted localities, and those in which absolutely the same species are found 

 widely distributed. 



The genera known to me with the exception of a single new one, have been 

 fully described in other works, and may be thus arranged : 



Mentum dente bicuspi ; ungues plus minusve serrati : 



Paraglossae ligula non longiores .... Calathus. 



Paraglossae longiores, ultra ligulam extensae . . Pristodactyla. 

 Mentum dente simplici ; ungues simplices :

Feronia gregaria Say, Trans. Am. Phil. Soc. 2, 47. 



Calathus distinguendus Lee. Proc. Acad. Nat. Sc 2, 53. Ann. Lye. 4, 216. 



A common species in the Middle and Eastern States, and is found occa- 

 sionally at Lake Superior. The North American species of this genus are very 

 closely allied, and seem hardly worthy of being separated; ^nevertheless, the 

 three species recognized by me in the Atlantic portion of the continent, are as 

 well distinguished from each other as from those of the Pacific coast. This one 

 will be readily recognized by the shining lustre and the moderately broad re- 

 flexed lateral margin of the thorax; in the next species the lateral margin is 

 narrower, perceptibly depressed, and not at all refiexed towards the posterior 

 angles. For authentic specimens of this species I am indebted to Dr. Harris. 



2. C. confusus, longiusculus, piceus pernitidus, apterus, thorace latitudine 

 sublongiore, antice subangustato, lateribus testaceis late rotundatis margine an-

striis tenuibus profundi?, punctis tribus impressis, antennis palpis pedibusque tes- 

 taceis. Long. -31 -35. 



Lake Superior ; abundant. Very similar to the preceding, but a little nar- 

 rower in its form, and with the lateral margin of the thorax not distinctly wider 

 towards the posterior angles, and less reflexed. 



3. C. o p a c u 1 u s, longiusculus, piceus, thorace latitudine non longiore, 

 antice subangustato, lateribus testaceis iatius subdepressis, non reflexis, basi 

 utrinque paulo impresso, elytris fere opacis, striis tenuibus hand profundis, 

 punctis tribus impressis, antennis palpis pedibusque testaceis. Long. 35 42. 



Middle, Southern and Western States; rare. This species, with the form of 

 C. gregarius, has the dull elytra and finely impressed strias of C. ruficollis ; it 

 seems also sufficiently distinct from the preceding species, by the sides of the 

 thorax being' depressed, broader behind and not reflexed. 



4. C. qu a d r i c o 1 1 i s, longiusculus, piceus, apterus, thorace latitudine 

 non breviore, antice vix angustato utrinque subimpresso, elytris fere opacis, striis 

 tenuibus non profundis, punctis 3 vel 4 impressis, antennis palpis pedibusque 

 testaceis. Long. '27 *4. 



San Francisco, California. This species is narrower than C. ruficollis, and is 

 readily distinguished by the form of the thorax; the thorax and head have a 

 reddish tinge, but do not appear ever to reach the deep, dull rufous color observed 

 in C. ruficollis. 



5. C. ruficollis, latiusculus, piceus, apterus, capite thoraceque piceo-rufis, 

 hoc latitudine breviore, antice angustato, lateribus (prsesertim antice) rotundatis, 

 margine minus distincte depresso subrefiexo, basi utrinque subimpresso, elytris 

 fere opacis striis tenuibus, punctis 3 impressis, antennis palpis pedibusque rufo- 

 testaceis. Long. -35 -4. 



Dej. Sp. Gen. 3, 78 ; Mann. Bull. Mosc. 1843, 195. 



San Francisco and San Diego. Considerably wider than any of the preceding 

 species, and with the sides of the thorax anteriorly more rounded ; the sides con- 

 verge a little near the base, whereby the posterior angles are rendered less rec- 

 tangular than in those above described. This species and the preceding, fre- 

 quently subject travellers to great annoyance by crawling over their bodies at 

 night, when sleeping on the ground ; the multitudes which are seen in March 

 and April, under every object capable of affording them shelter, are worthy of 

 admiration. 



6. C. ob s c u r u s, minus elongatus, piceus, apterus, thorace latitudine non 

 breviore, antrorsum angustato, lateribus rotundatis (angulis basalibus obtusiori- 

 bus) margine depresso subrefiexo, basi utrinque subimpresso, elytris fere opacis, 

 striis tenuibus non profundis, punctis tribus impressis, antennis palpis pedi- 

 busque iufo-testaceis. Long. *4. 



One female found in the Southern part of California. This species differs from 

 C. ruficollis and C. quadricollis by the form of the thorax, which is not wider 

 than long, considerably narrowed in front and moderately rounded on the sides, 

 which are distinctly depressed even to the base, and hardly reflexed. The elytra 

 are more distinctly wider than the thorax, but otherwise are formed and sculp- 

 tured as in C ruficollis.

 striis profundis, bipunctatis, antennis palpis pedibusque rufis, unguihus valde 

 serratis. Long. -35 *42.

Feronia impunctata Say, Trans. Am. Phil. Soc. 2, 45. 



Pristodactyla americaiia Dej. Sp. Gen. 3, 83. 



Middle States ; rare. Smaller than the next, and distinguished by the thorax 




38 [April, 



being more distinctly narrowed towards the base, and by the elytra being slightly 

 dilated from the base to the posterior third. 



I have great doubts of the propriety of separating this genus from Taphria ; 

 the very slight difference in the form of the last joint of the labial palpi, which 

 is less dilated in the American species, is surely insufficient. From the differ- 

 ence in the form of the ungues, noticed in the species below, I am inclined to 

 believe, that a natural arrangement would require all the genera (so called) of 

 this group, in which the mentum tooth is emarginate, the paraglossae longer than 

 the ligula, and the ungues serrate, to be united into one genus. The species 

 contained in Pristonychus, Pristodactyla and Taphria do not appear more dif- 

 ferent from each other than those embraced in Platynus.

Lee. Ann. Lye. 4, 217. 



Lake Superior ; not rare on the northern shore; a specimen from the north- 

 eastern boundary of Maine was kindly given me by Mr. Brevoort. More slender 

 than any of the other species here described, and very similar in appearance to 

 some of the smaller European Pristonychus. The mentum tooth is much less 

 emarginate than in the preceding. 



4. P. dub i a, nigra, minus nitida, thorace obovato, postice magis angustato, 

 angulis posticis obtusis, rotundatis, basi depressa utrinque subfoveata^ elytris 

 thorace latioribus subellipticis, tenuiter striatis bipunctatis, antennis pedibusque 

 piceis, unguibus ba>i vix obsolete serrulatis. Long. -48. 



One specimen: New Mexico; collected by Mr. Fendler. The base of the 

 thorax is only about two-thirds as wide as the apex ; the dorsal line is fine, but 

 the transverse impressions are well marked. The mentum tooth is narrow, and 

 very slightly emarginate at the tip. 



In these four species, the under surface of the tarsi is glabrous, and the outer 

 margin of the two posterior pairs is deeply grooved. In my synopsis of Pteros- 

 tichus (Journ. Acad. Nat. Sc.,2d ser., vol. 2) it will be seen that in closely allied 

 species, the latter character is of little value. The same would seem to be the 

 case in the present group, and no better proof is required than the remarks made 

 by Baron Chaudoir, on the page immediately opposite that in which he insists 

 strongly on the great assistance which is derived from it in distinguishing Cala- 

 thus from Pristonychus. The real difference between the genera is precisely 

 that so long ago made known by Erichson, viz., the length of the paraglossae, 

 which in Calathus do not extend beyond the ligula, while in Pristonychus (and 

 likewise in Pristodactyla and Taphria) they are very distinctly elongated.

Palpi tenues, acuminati, maxillares articulo ultimo paulo longiore ; antennae 

 filiformes, articulo lmo crassiore,. et longiore; mentum dente medio simplici; 

 ligula truncata, paraglossis angustis longioribus. 



A curious insect, having very much the appearance of Diaphorus, but having 

 the head less constricted posteriorly, and the elytra rounded at the apex ; the 

 thorax is long and cordate, almost turned into a pedicel at the base, with the 

 impressions elongate and very narrow ; the elytra are twice as wide as the thorax, 

 oblong and convex, with the humoral angles rounded, and the apex scarcely

sinuate ; the striae are deep and moderately punctured, the intervals are narrow, 

 convex, and are each marked with a row of very fine punctures, from which pro- 

 ceed very short hairs. 



The legs are moderately long, the anterior tibiae scarcely dilated at the apex, 

 with the emargination extending nearly to the middle ; in the male the first three 

 joints of the anterior tarsi are very slightly dilated, and furnished beneath with 

 a few papilla3. The antennas are very slightly thickened externally ; the first 

 three joints and the base of the fourth are smooth, but furnished with a few scat- 

 tered hairs ; the first is longer than the third, and somewhat thicker than in the 

 other genera of this group. The paraglossae are narrow, curved, and longer than 

 the truncate ligula ; the tooth in the emargination of the mentum is moderately 

 large, and almost acute at the tip. The palpi are slender and moderately long ; 

 the last joint is elongate oval, and almost acute at the tip; that of the maxillary 

 palpi is distinctly longer than the penultimate joint. 



It seems by its characters closely to approach Stomis, but the mandibles are not 

 so long and the labrum is not at all emarginate. By the structure of the anterior 

 tibiae as well as by the sexual characters, it evidently belongs to the* present 

 group.

Massachusutts, Dr. Harris; Illinois, Mr.Willcox. Finding in this insect many 

 of the characters of Stomis, I was misled by the very poor description of Mr. 

 Laporte, (Etudes Entom. 1, 72) with which it agrees as closely as could be ex- 

 pected, in every respect except size. Baron Chaudoir, as I have already ob- 

 served in my synopsis of Pterostichus, (Journ. Acad. Nat. Sc, 2d ser., 2,) has 

 since stated that Mr. Laporte's insect is Feronia fastidita Dej. Under these 

 circumstances, the specific name adopted by me under error falls, and I take 

 pleasure in giving to the insect the name under which it was communicated to 

 me by Dr. Harris.

This genus only differs essentially from Platynus by the greater length of the 

 third joint of the antennae, which is one half longer than the fourth joint ; the 

 first joint is short, being about one-half longer than the second. The form of body 

 is that of the first division of Platynus, but the margins of the thorax and elytra 

 are more broadly rerlexed, and the elytra are strongly sinuate at the apex ; the 

 antennas and feet are also longer. These characters give the insect a considerable 

 resemblance, in general appearance, to Anophthalmia.

Le Conte, Ann. Lye. 4, 219. 



One specimen (male) found near St. Louis, Missouri, was kindly given my by 

 Dr. Engelmann. In the State of Ohio, Dr. Schaum procured a dark brownish 

 black specimen, in which the sinus of the elytra was so strong, as to form on 

 each side of the apex a tooth; the specimen was a female, but not having it be- 

 fore me for examination, I cannot determine whether the difference is to be re- 

 garded as sexual or specific, 



Platynus Bon. (emend. Brulle.) 

 Under this generic name I group, after the example of Mr. Brulle, those spe- 




40 [April, 



cies upon which Bonelli formed his three genera, Platynus, Anehomenus, and 

 Agonum. My reason for preferring for this assemblage of species the name 

 Platynus, is merely, that such was the name chosen by Mr. Brulle, who was 

 the first entomologist to perceive the necessity of merging the groups into one 

 genus. Two years afterwards, Erichson proposed to call the assemblage of 

 Bonelli's three genera by the name Anehomenus, alleging that Platynus was in- 

 applicable to most of the species, and that it had, moreover, been employed (in 

 the form Platyna) for a genus of Diptera ; the first point, in the present state of 

 nomenclature, need not occupy our attention; the second point is also without 

 weight, since Platyna was proposed as a genus many years after the establish- 

 ment of Platynus by Bonelli, and before it was shown that the latter genus in- 

 cluded any other form than that to which it was limited by the author. The 

 name Platynus was consequently not vacant, and its application in any form, to 

 a genus other than that intended by Bonelli was improper. 



This genus, as here understood, contains a very large number of species, all 

 agreeing in having the paraglossae scarcely longer than the ligula ; the mentum 

 tooth distinct and not emarginate ; the palpi slender, with the last joint ahout 

 equal to the preceding; the first joint of the antennae moderately thick, not 

 longer than the third, which again is not longer than the fourth; the tarsi are 

 filiform, and the ungues entirely smooth. 



The antennas are usually filiform, but sometimes setaceous. The form of body 

 is variable, usually somewhat slender, with the elytra nearly twice as wide as 

 the head or thorax, and oval or oblong, sometimes elliptical ; the elytra are 

 either rounded, truncate or emarginate at the base, usually slightly sinuate at 

 the apex, and sometimes almost truncate, in which case a form of body results 

 not unlike Dromius or Metabletus. Occasionally the form of body is stouter, 

 and the elytra are hardly one half wider than the thorax ; and in some west- 

 ern species, unknown to me, the form is said to be almost similar to Calathus ; 

 these latter species have been separated by Motschulsky as Tanystoma, (after- 

 wards changed to Tanystola) ; the only characters given are, that the last joint of 

 the palpi is longer than the preceding, and the posterior angles of the thorax ob- 

 tuse. Scaphiodactylus (Chaudoir) is also said to have the palpi as in Tanystola, 

 but the posterior angles of the thorax are acute. Not having identified these 

 genera, I can with propriety say nothing in regard to them. 



The thorax is very variable in form, being sometimes oval, sometimes cordate, 

 square, or rounded ; the margin is sometimes strongly reflexed, sometimes hardly 

 visible. The interval between the second and third stria; of the elytra is always 

 marked with punctures, or fovae, varying in number from three to seven ; some 

 species, not known to me by personal observation, are described as having but 

 two punctures. 



To facilitate the determination of our species, the following division into 

 groups may be found useful.

The cases of difficulty, in referring species by this table, will be but few ; a 

 species (P. quadratus) is placed in (f.,) which might, with almost equal propriety, 

 be placed with (d.) ; still, the form is less slender, and the margin of the thorax 

 much more obvious than in the latter group. 



P. crenulatus in group (F.) differs from the others of the same group, by the 

 broader and more quadrate elytra ; still, its chief affinities appear to be with that 

 group, and I have, therefore, not separated it from its allies. 



A. 



The species of this group are of a slender form and not winged ; the legs and 

 antennae are long ; the thorax is obovate, usually elongate ; the posterior angles 

 are obtuse and rounded at the apex ; the lateral margin is strongly reflexed, and 

 is broader than usual. The elytra are regularly elliptical, with no distinct hu- 

 meral angles ; they are sinuate towards the tip ; the lateral margin is broader 

 than in any other group, and is strongly reflexed. This group corresponds to 

 Platynus of Bonelli and Dejean.

Found in the mountains near Santa Isabpl, in the southern part of California. 

 One specimen has four impressed punctures on the elytra. The antennae, instead 

 of being setaceous, as in the next two species, are slightly thickened beyond the 

 fourth joint, as in most of the species of this genus.

 tures mentioned, there are several on the sutural stria before the middle. De- 

 jean's description is very full, but lest any entomologist should hesitate in refer- 

 ring this species to the description given by Say, which is certainly defective in 

 some particulars, I transcribe it to save the labor of future reference.

 be distinguished from those which we have mentioned to be referable to that 

 genus by the color of its feet."

One specimen, found at Sault Ste Marie. This species resembles in appearance 

 P. sinuatus, &c, below, but from the absence of wings, and from the form of the 

 thorax, I am induced to place it in the present division. The margin of the thorax 

 is not as wide as in the other species, but is a little dilated towards the posterior 

 angles ; the basal impressions are deep, and are destitute of punctures or lines. 

 The elytra are slightly convex, and their lateral margin is somewhat narrower 

 than in the preceding species. 



B a. 



Composed of winged species, of a piceous black color and slender form ; the 

 antennas are long and setaceous; the thorax is strongly margined, a little wider 

 than long, somewhat narrowed posteriorly, with the basal angles obtuse, neither 

 prominent nor rounded ; the posterior transverse impression is strong, and the 

 basal impressions moderately long and deep. The elytra are more than twice 

 as wide as the thorax, truncate at base, finely margined, sinuate towards the 

 extremity ; the humeral angles are rounded ; the striae are fine, and the third in- 

 terstice has three punctures, the first being placed in the 3d stria, the other two 

 in the 2d stria.

One specimen, found at the Sault Ste Marie. Although very much resembling 

 the next species in all its characters, the thorax is comparatively so much nar- 

 rower, that I am obliged to consider it as distinct. The base of the thorax is 

 more obliquely truncate each side, by which the basal angles are rendered more 

 obtuse. By a clerical error the specific name is printed angusiicollis, in Agassiz' 

 Lake Superior.

 lateral margin of the thorax being as wide anteriorly as towards the base, and 

 more strongly reflexed.

Middle and Southern States ; common. The last two synonyms belong to a < 

 variety in which the interstices of the elytra, instead of being slightly convex as 

 usual, are entirely flat ; there are, however, no other differences of a definite 

 character, and I see no reason why they should be retained as distinct. The 

 brevity of Mr. Haldeman's description will make it doubtful whether this or 

 the preceding species was meant, but a typical specimen kindly furnished me by 

 'him evidently belongs to the present species. 



Dr. Harris possesses a specimen of this species, which was named Feronia 

 maculifrons, by Mr. Say; with the description (Journ. Acad. Nat. Sc. vol.3, p. 

 146) of that species it does not agree. 



B b. 



Containing two winged species from California, closely allied to those of the 

 preceding division, but of a somewhat less slender form, and with filiform an- 

 tennae. The thorax is strongly margined, slightly narrowed towards the base, 

 with the posterior angls obtuse, not rounded, and slightly prominent; the pos- 

 terior transverse impression is deep, and the basal impressions shallow ; the 

 elytra are twice as wide as the thorax, truncate at base, with the humeral angles 

 rounded ; they are finely margined and very slightly sinuate towards the tip; the 

 strise are fine, the interstices slightly convex, and the third has frequently four 

 impressed punctures, which, however, seem liable to considerable variation ; 

 the normal number appears to be three.

San Diego, California. The lateral margin of the thorax is moderately wide 

 and not dilated posteriorly ; the basal impressions are marked with a short im- 

 pressed line at the bottom. Apart from color this species is distinguished from 

 the next by the narrower thorax and more slender form.

 Long. *42. 



San Francisco, California ; very abundant. Specimens occur with three, four, 

 and even five punctures on the third interstice of the elytra ; the impressed lines 

 of the basal impressions of the thorax are less distinct than in the preceding ; 

 the antennae and palpi are nearly black ? the tarsi are sometimes dark piceous. 



I have distributed this insect under the name Anch. brunneo-marginatus (Mann. 

 Bull. Mosc. 1843, 196,) but on reconsidering the matter, I find so many points 

 of disagreement, that 1 am obliged to propose a new name. His description reads : 



"Apterus, niger, depressus, capite laevissimo inter antennas impresso, thorace 

 longiore, subcordato, lateribus refiexo-marginatis, angulis posticis acutiusculis, 




44 [April, 



elytris oblongo-ovalibus, apice sinuatis, leviter striatis, punctis tribus minutis 

 impressis, antennis pedibus, thoracis elytrorurnque margine rufo-brunneis. Long. 

 4* lin. lat. H lin." 



With regard to the value of the first word of this diagnosis, I will merely ob- 

 serve that it occurs also in Count Mannerheim's diagnosis of Anch. maeulicoUis 

 (1. c. 199,) which, however, I found at San Diego, in July, flying about in the 

 evening twilight in such numbers as to be a source of great annoyance. 



B c. 



The species of this group are moderately large, winged, and a pure shining 

 black color; the thorax is slightly cordiform, with the posterior angles rectan- 

 gular; the dorsal line and anterior transverse impression are deep ; the basal 

 impressions are large, moderately deep and finely punctulate; the lateral margin 

 is moderate and is strongly retlexed, and slightly diaphanous in a strong light. 

 The elytra are more than one half broader than the thorax, truncate at base, 

 slightly sinuate at the extremity ; they are somewhat flattened on the disc, and 

 declivous towards the margin ; the stria? are deep, and the third interstice has 

 three impressed punctures. 



I regret to be partly answerable for the confusion introduced among the 

 species of this group, by mistaking those which have been already described, 

 and incautiously admitting some which are not sufficiently distinct. Having 

 carefully re-examined the subject, I hope that the results, here arrived at, may 

 be found corrrct.

 made from a badly preserved specimen, in which the wings had probably been 

 pulled off to enable the elytra to be brought together ; at least, on raising the 

 elytra, I find fragments of the wings still remaining. The distinctive characters 

 of the species are the larger size, the less distinct posterior angles of the thorax, 

 (which are almost obtuse and very slightly rounded,) and the less lustrous and 

 more flattened elytra. The .fine punctures of the striae are sometimes almost 

 invisible. Dejean mentions four elytral punctures ; the second one, however, is 

 abnormal.

 really Dejean's species. He says, in comparison, with the preceding, "le corselet

 The only satisfactory characters I can find are the smaller size, the more shining, 

 less depressed and less deeply striate elytra.

 to disappear ; 1 have therefore hesitated to propose a new name lor this, and 

 consider it, like the previous one, as a race under P. sinuatus.

A group containing winged species, evidently allied to P. exte n si collis 

 &c, but differing by having only three elytral punctures ; the feet and antennas 

 are entirely black. The thorax is flattened, moderately margined, the margin 

 growing broader towards the base; it is almost longer than wide, very slightly' 

 narrowed posteriorly, hardly sinuate on the sides, truncate at base, with the pos- 

 terior angles rectangular, not rounded ; the basal impressions are very long and 

 finely rugous ; the elytra are flattened, truncate at base, slightly sinuate at apex ; 

 the striae are deep and fine, the interstices flattish, the 3d with three impressed

C e. 



A group of extreme complexity, containing winged species of metallic colors, 

 bluish or greenUh, with the base of the antennas, the feet, and occasionally the 

 thorax rufous or pale piceous. The antennae are long and filiform ; the thorax 

 is occasionally a little longer than wide, never much narrowed posteriorly, the 

 margin fine, but strongly reflexed, moderately rounded on the sides; the base is 

 oblique each side, and the posterior angles are obtuse and sometimes moderately 

 rounded ; the basal impressions are long, and posteriorly are marked with a short 

 line. The elytra are elongate, about twice as wide as the thorax, scarcely sinu- 

 ate posteriorly, striae deep, but usually fine, the interstices hardly convex, the 

 third with four to seven punctures, varying in the same species. By arranging 

 the different forms as races under the more distinct species, this group appears 

 to be capable of being reduced to order.

Middle, Southern, and Western States and Lake Superior ; Massachusetts. Dr. 

 Harris; (lat. 54 according to Kirby.) This is usually considered as the type of 

 Say's species, and is distinguished by the shining color, by the thorax being more 

 distinctly narrowed posteriorly, with less rounded angles, and by the tubercle 

 between the basal impression and the angle being distinct. The punctures of 

 the base are fine, occasionally extending along the whole base, but sometimes 

 visible only in the impressions. The color of the elytra sometimes varies to- 

 wards bluish and coppery. The under surface is black.

 eties and all the intermediate forms are found on the shores of Onondaga Lake, 

 near Syracuse, New York. 1 think that Anch. thoracicus Dej. must belong to 

 this species, but as the fine punctures of the elytra are not mentioned in his des- 

 cription, it will be safer to consider it as distinct ; in some specimens of () they 

 might, however, readily be overlooked.

San Francisco, San Jose and San Diego, California. I am doubtful about the 

 propriety of referring this to Dejean's species, which is described as having the 

 head and thorax obscure greenish-bronzed ; slight traces of such color may be 

 perceived in some of my specimens, but usually they are of a brownish black 

 color, slightly tinted with bronze. In the uncertainty which hangs over many 

 of the species, and under my great want of success in collecting (or perhaps in 

 identifying) the species found in California, it would be hardly prudent to pro- 

 pose this as a new species. The refiexed margin of the thorax is distinct, but 

 very narrow. 



D f. 



Winged species mostly of a black color, with the legs and antennae of the same 

 color as the body ; the thorax is rounded, with the posterior angles very obtuse, 

 or altogether rounded; the margin is moderately broad, usually slightly dilated 

 and refiexed towards the base ; the basal impressions are broad and shallow ; the 

 elytra are not much wider than the thorax, truncate, or even subemarginate at 

 the base, rounded and hardly perceptibly sinuate towards the extremity ; the in- 

 terstices are mostly fiat, and the third has three punctures, the second of which, 

 except when otherwise stated, is placed on or near the third stria. A numerous 

 group, containing closely allied, yet quite distinct species.

Louisiana; Dr. Schaum. A very distinct species, having the reflexed margin 

 of the thorax broader than in any of the following; the basal impressions, al- 

 though deep, are formed principally by the union of the reflexed margin with 

 the moderately convex disc, and are consequently very indefinite. The punctures 

 of the striae of the elytra are very distinct.

Louisiana, Dr. Schaum; Pennsylvania. This species differs from P. tenuis and 

 others having fine elytral striae, by the greater breadth of the reflexed margin of 

 the thorax, (which, however, is narrower than in the preceding,) and by the 

 greater distinctness of the posterior angles ; the reflexed margin is sometimes 

 tinged with piceous ; the second elytral puncture is very near the second stria.

Middle States, abundant; Vermont, Dr. Harris. The more reflexed thoracic 

 margin the deeper basal impressions, and the distinct tubercle near the angle 

 will readily separate this species from P. Harrisii. Dr. Harris thinks that this 

 is not the species intended by Dejean. As, however, the latter says that the 

 tibiae, tarsi and basal joint of the antennae are sometimes of a brownish color, I 

 think that he cannot refer to any other of our species having three elytral punc- 

 tures. A specimen having the thorax a little longer and less regularly rounded 

 on the sides, was sent me, by Dr. Harris, under the name Agomim nitidum \ I 

 cannot, however, find sufficiently definite characters to separate it.

Middle and Eastern States, rare. Sufficiently distinct from P. melanarius, by 

 the slightly bronzed color, more obtuse and more rounded posterior thoracic an- 

 gles, and less deep and impunctured elytral striae. From P. metallescens, which 

 it resembles in the form of the thorax, it is easily known by the smooth elytral 

 striae and more dull color. From P. moerens, it is distinguished by the wider 

 thorax with more rounded base and less distinct posterior angles. 



Dr. Harris sent a specimen as Ag. collare Say ; the impunctured striae, how- 

 ever, prevent it from being referred to the species described by him under the 

 same name in the Trans. Am. Phil. Soc. as above quoted.

Massachusetts and Lake Superior. The inequalities of the elytra are pro- 

 duced by irregular dilated shallow impressions along the course of the striae : the 

 most obvious of these is usually near the extremity of the fifth striae : Dr. Harris 

 regards this as specific, and therefore applied to the species the unpublished 

 name Ag. sulcatum. The thorax is less transverse and less rounded than in the 

 preceding species, and the sides are less distinctly reflexed towards the base. 

 The second elytral puncture is on the second stria.

 placed about the middle on the third stria, as in most of the species above 

 described : the lateral margin of the thorax is hardly wider towards the poste-

One specimen found in Nebraska, near the mountains. From its color and 

 form this species, at first sight, resembles a small specimen of P. extensicollis, 

 but on comparison it is found completely different. The basal impressions of the 

 thorax are not prolonged anteriorly, and the margin is not wider at the rounded 

 posterior angles. The third interstice of the elytra has only three very small 

 punctures, of which the second and third are placed on the second stria.

One specimen, New York. Resembles in form P. nutans, but the elytra have 

 only three small punctures (the second near the second stria on one elytron, and 

 near the third on the other ;) the striae are deeper and very finely punctulate ; 

 from P. subcordatus, it differs by the longer thorax. 



F. 



Winged species of a slender form, usually black, sometimes, hower, piceous, 

 and in one instance of a metallic green color ; the base of the antennae and the feet 

 are yellow ; the thorax is oval, with the margin narrowly reflexed becoming 

 broader towards the posterior angles, which are rounded and indistinct; the 

 basal impressions are narrow, sometimes deep and smooth, sometimes nearly 

 obsolete. The elytra are elongate oval, twice as wide as the thorax, moderately 

 convex, emarginate at the base and obliquely subtruncate at tip; the striae are 

 fine, the interstices flat, the third marked with five or six punctures.

Georgia, rare ; Louisiana, Dr. Schaum. This species establishes, by its form 

 and characters, a passage from this group towards P. excavatus among those 

 having three elytral punctures. The elytra are broader and more square in their 

 outline than in any other species of this group, to which, nevertheless, it seems 

 most closely related ; in one specimen three joints of the antenna? are pale, in 

 the other only the first one is dark testaceous.

Lake Superior, Massachusetts and New York. The first specimen described 

 by me was defective in having very small elytral punctures, whereby I was led 

 into the error of describing the elytra as having only three punctures on the 

 third interstice. The thorax is larger and wider in proportion than the last spe- 

 cies, but the elytra are wider and less elliptical than in the remaining species of 

 this group, and the stria? are deeper. I am somewhat doubtful about referring 

 Dejean's description to this species, since not only the first joint of the antennae, 

 but very frequently three or four joints are paler than the outer joints, and the 

 striae of the elytra, in comparison with the following species, could hardly be 

 called fine. As, however, Dejean implies that the sides of the thorax are some- 

 what reflexed posteriorly, I must acknowledge that my reference of his species 

 to what is described below as P. picipennis, must be considered faulty.

 differs from the preceding in having the thorax still more finely margined, with 

 the basal impressions smaller and less marked ; the striae of the elytra are finer, 

 and the punctures appear to be larger and never more than four in number. I 

 formerly distributed this species as Agonum sordens Kirby, (Fauna Bor. Am.

 the others in or near the second stria. The thorax is sometimes entirely testa-

 elytral punctures are placed on the third, the posterior three, or two (as the case 

 may be) are adjacent to the second stria. In one specimen there are only three 

 punctures on the third stria, the other four being on the second. The basal im- 

 pressions do not combine with the concavity near the margin (as in P. placidus) 

 but remain distinct. 



Mr. Motschulsky (Bull. Mosc. 1845, pars 1, 21,) has mentioned a species 

 under the name Agonum limlatttm, which may be identical with our insect. He 

 merely states, " in size and form it resembles closely A. p e 1 i d n u m, but is 

 readily distinguished by the whitish margin of the elytra." The specific name 

 is, however, preoccupied by Say.

 broad and obsoletely prolonged anteriorly to the middle, and occasionally slightly 

 punctulate. 



a. This is a single specimen from San Francisco, in which the thorax is not 

 wider than long, almost square, and less rounded on the sides than in the other 

 specimens, but with the posterior angles less distinct and more rounded. The 

 general form of the body is narrower, but as I have not found the characters 

 sufficiently distinct, it would be imprudent for the present to separate it under 

 another name.

I. 



r A group of small black winged species, having the thorax transverse, rounded 

 at the sides and base, with the posterior angles very obtuse, but usually distinct ; 

 the margin is narrowly reflexed, especially towards the posterior angles; the 

 basal impressions are not obvious, being lost in the concavity between the mar- 

 gin and the disc ; the elytra are oblong, and flattened ; they are deeply emarginate 

 at base ; when the elytra have three small punctures, they are almost truncate 

 at tip, and are slightly sinuate: when I he elytra are deeply foveate, the sutural 

 portion is more prolonged, so that the truncation becomes oblique. The striae 

 are veiy fine and badly defined; the legs and antennae are black; the latter area 

 little stouter than usual, though hardly perceptibly so.

 flexed margin is a little wider. The elytra are comparatively much shorter, 

 being not more than one half longer than wide, while in P. obsoletus they are

Kirby's genus Sericoda was formed on an erroneous examination of the palpi

of a distorted or mutilated specimen. Chaudoir (Bull. Mosc. 1844, p. 70) has 

 established a genus Rhytiderus, upon Dromius 10-punctatus, from South Ame- 

 rica, but which, as observed by Erichson, (Bericht fiber Kntom. 1844,) be- 

 longs to Kirby's Sericoda. The relation between the genus Sericoda, and a very 

 common insect of northern Europe, does not, however, appear to have been 

 suspected by any of the authors,

 P. quadripunctatus, and in my catalogue of Lake Superior Coleoptera, I gave it 

 as such on his authority. On comparing, however, a large number of specimens 

 with one found in Sweden, the posterior angles of the thorax, although very ob- 

 tuse, appear to be always well defined, while in the European specimen the 

 angles and the base are rounded together, so that the apex of the angle cannot 

 be defined. 



Many of the specimens have two slightly impressed foveae before the middle 

 of the thorax, but some are found without such impressions.

On Fossil Coniferous Wood, from Prince Edward Island. 



By J. W. Dawson. 



Under the impression that any facts relating to the formation which lias af- 

 forded the interesting reptilian fragment recently described by Dr. Leidy in the 

 Journal of this Academy, will prove interesting, 1 beg leave to communicate 

 the following results of microscopic examinations of the coniferous wood referred 

 to in my note appended to Dr. Leidy's paper. 



I may premise that Prince Edward Island, which extends in an east and west 

 direction about 130 miles, with an extreme breadth of about 35 miles, consists 

 almost entirely of bright red sandstones, similar to the matrix of Dr. Leidy's 

 fossil, with occasional bands of red clay, conglomerate and arenaceous and con- 

 cretionary limestone. Over a large part of the island, these beds dip at very 

 small angles to the northward. There are, however, some tracts in which the 

 beds undulate to the southward and south-east. These red rocks, in their mine- 

 ral character, much resemble the new red sandstone of Cornwallis and other 




1854.]

r> 



places in Nova Scotia, and Dr. Gesner, in his Report on the Geology of Prince 

 Edward Island,* notices the occurrence of trap dykes at two localities on the 

 northern coast, a circumstance which still farther increases the resemblance. 

 There are, however, a few places in which beds occur which much resemble 

 the upper parts of the coal formation of Nova Scotia, and it is in these localities 

 chiefly, though I believe not exclusively, that the coniferous wood in question 

 occurs, along with a few other vegetable fragments, for the most part very im- 

 perfectly preserved. Some interest, therefore, attaches to these fragments of 

 fossilized wood, as a means of comparison between the oldest portions of the red 

 sandstone formation of Prince Edward Island, and the inferior members of the 

 coal formation on the opposite coasts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, in 

 which coniferous wood is also of very frequent occurrence. 



1. Coniferous wood from Gallas or Gallows Point , west side of Orwell Bay. 

 At this place, which I visited in 1842, the following beds appear in descending 

 order, the dip being to E. S. E. at angles of 6 to 8 : red and brownish sand- 

 stones, gray sandstone with bands of concretionary limestone, and containing 

 carbonized vegetable fragments, some of them resembling catamites, but without 

 joints, gray and brown shales or indurated clays; brownish sandstone, with 

 large trunks of trees silicified. One of these trunks measured three feet in its 

 greatest diameter ; they are prostrate and somewhat flattened. I have no doubt 

 that these rocks underlie the ordinary red sandstones of the island, and Dr. Ges- 

 ner, who examined them in 1847, takes the same view, affirming them to be 

 carboniferous, and stating that he found in them catamites and stigmaria, which, 

 if well characterized specimens, would go far to confirm that conclusion. 



My specimens of fossil wood from this place are perfectly silicified, and of a 

 dark clove-brown color. They are much fissured in the direction of the medul- 

 lary rays, and the fissures are filled with flesh colored sulphate of barytes. Under 

 the microscope, transverse slices show a somewhat dense tissue of quadrangular 

 cells arranged in rows. Longitudinal slices in the direction of the medullary 

 rays, show parallel elongated cells, medullary rays not strongly marked, and 

 traces of hexagonal discs of the Araucarian type on the walls of the cells. Two 

 rows of these discs occupy the whole breadth of a cell. 



2. Specimens from Des Sables and Crapaud. At these localities the only 

 rocks seen are the ordinary red sandstones, and the coniferous wood is found 

 only in loose fragments on the surface. From the large quantity scattered over 

 the fields, and the general scarcity of travelled boulders in this part of the island, 

 I have no doubt that it now lies over or near its original site. The specimens 

 from this place are dense and without fissures, and have a structure quite similar 

 to that of the wood from Gallas Point, though not in so perfect preservation. 



3. A specimen from, some part of the sovth shore of Prince Edward Island , now 

 in the collection of the Puton Literary Society. This specimen was obtained 

 from a person who stated that it was a portion of a large trunk. It still retains 

 in its crevices remnants of the matrix of coarse reddish sandstone. It is cracked 

 in lines radiating from the centre, and is perforated by numerous vermicular 

 holes, now somewhat flattened, but which were probably the burrows either of 

 Teredines or xylophagous larvae. Some parts of this specimen retain their 

 structure in a very perfect condition. It is of precisely the same character with 

 that already described, and shows one or two rows of discs on each cell. 



All these specimens probably belong to the same genus, and perhaps to the 

 same species of coniferous trees ; and they all differ materially from the conife- 

 rous wood of the coal formation. I have slices of the latter from various parts 

 of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Cape Breton, some of them from the new- 

 est beds of the coal formation. All of them are of much coarser texture than 

 the specimens from Prince Edward Island. The cells are wider, and usually 

 with three or even four rows of discs, and the medullary tissue is more strongly 

 marked. In the closeness of the cellular tissue, fewer rows of discs, and fine- 

 ness of the medullary rays, the Prince Edward Island specimens, though dis- 

 tinctly of the Araucarian type, approach more nearly to the modern pines of this 



* 1847.

country than to those of the coal formation. They therefore afford no proof 

 that these lower members of the red sandstone formation of Prince Edward 

 Island are of carboniferous date, but would rather tend to connect them with the 

 overlying beds which have afforded the remains of the Bathygnathus borealis. 

 The occurrence, however, in this position, of rocks so nearly resembling those 

 of the upper coal formation, renders it probable that no very sudden or marked 

 physical changes intervened between the deposition of the latter and that of the 

 new red sandstones, and thus furnish an argument in favor of the Permian date 

 of this last deposit.* 



Description of a species of Crane found in Wisconsin^ presumed to be new* 

 By William Dudley, of Madison, Wisconsin. 



Grtis Hoyianus, nobis. 



Form. Size large ; second primary longest, first and second nearly equal ; tail 

 two inches longer than the folded wings ; numerous large feathers arise from the 

 base of each wing, elevated and droop down over the tail, giving the bird an os- 

 trich-like appearance. Head densely clothed with feathers to base of bill; no 

 naked shin. 



Dimensions. Length of wing from flexure 23 inches ; tarsi 11 5-10 inches ; 

 middle toe 5 inches, hind toe just reaches the ground; bill 5 inches. 



Color. Head and upper half of neck light ferruginous ; on the breast, back 

 and upper tail coverts are a few scattering feathers tipped with the same ; pri- 

 maries black, remaining parts white. Legs black. 



Observation. This fine large crane was killed on Sugar River, in Dane Co., 

 Wisconsin, and is now in the Museum of the Wisconsin Natural History Asso- 

 ciation. Sex not known. It is named in honor of my worthy friend Dr. P. R. 

 Hoy, of Racine, Wisconsin, whose untiring industry and zeal in Natural History 

 have added much to science. 



Description of Fossil Trees in the coal rocks near Greensburgh^ Westmoreland 



county ) Pennsylvania* 

 By Alfred T. King, M. D. 



Throughout nearly the whole of Western Pennsylvania, but more abundant in 

 particular localities, may be found fragments of immense silicified trees lying on 

 the surface of the ground. About seven miles east of Greensburgh there is a re- 

 markable locality. Here may be seen immense logs from six to eight feet long, 

 and from one to four feet in diameter, strewed over acres of ground. After the 

 closest examination, I have been unable to find any very clear indications of 

 high vegetable organization in these silicified trees. Indeed I have been unable, 

 after the closest scrutiny, to discover a single specimen of fossil plant in our 

 vast carboniferous series, of higher organization than vascular Cryptogamia. I 

 might, perhaps, except some specimens, which I first saw a few weeks since in 

 Beaver county, Pa., of Trigonocarpum? This is the fruit of a tree, which some 

 have supposed to be allied to the Palms ; of this, however, there is still great 

 doubt and uncertainty. 



Many of the specimens of silicified wood contain numerous and beautiful 

 crystals of quartz scattered throughout their interior structure, which would seem 

 to indicate that the silicifying process must have taken place whilst the wood 

 was immersed in water of high temperature. 



Whilst excavating a tunnel on the Pennsylvania Railroad near Greensburgh, a 

 stratum of very compact sandstone of about fifteen feet in thickness was opened', 

 which contained vast quantities of trunks and limbs of trees, some per- 

 meated with silicious and pyritous matter, whilst others have left only their 

 imprints, the woody matter having been converted into coal, which forms a thin

 London Geol. Soc. vol. 1. p. 322 ; and Taylor's Statistics of Coal, p. 196. 




1854.] 65 



but beautiful pellicle, covering the impressions of the plants. These trunks and 

 Jimbs are of all sizes, from an inch to nearly three feet in circumference, strewed 

 about, and piled upon each other in the most irregular manner, and so numerous 

 that scarcely a fragment of rock was thrown out which did not contain either a 

 vegetable impression or a silicified stem. 



Although in the shale above, vast piles of detached fern leaves were found, be- 

 longing principally to the genus Neuropteris t accompanied with numerous im- 

 pressions of Calamites, yet no species of fern was discovered in the sandstone, 

 with the exception of two specimens, both of which belonged to distinct genera. 

 The one was a Pecopteris, and the other was the Cyclopteris trichomanoides , 



Among the numerous arborescent fossil plants which were found in this sand- 

 stone, was an entire tree of immense magnitude, lying prostrate, about four feet 

 above the Pittsburgh seam of coal, and about thirty feet beneath the surface. 

 The part which was removed measured twenty six feet in length, and two feet 

 ten inches in circumference at the base. From the size of the two main branches 

 which enter the rock on the opposite side, I infer that this tree may have been 

 from forty to sixty feet in height. At the base, it was much flattened by the 

 pressure of the superincumbent weight, but strange as it may seem, the branches 

 still retained nearly their original cylindrical form. It was entirely enveloped in 

 a coating of pure bituminous coal, varying from a quarter of an inch to one inch 

 in thickness. Its interior was filled with sand, mixed with sulphuret and car- 

 bonate of iron, which much increased its weight, but there were no indications 

 of vegetable structure. The thin vegetable band, which alone remained con- 

 verted into pure bituminous coal, may have surrounded an axis of more perishable 

 material, which, when the tree was removed from its original position by the 

 storms or the Waves, rapidly decayed. Its hollow interior would necessarily be 

 filled with sand, broken shale or other sediment which was brought by large 

 rivers into that turbulent sea, the bed of which was gradually subsiding. This 

 view is corroborated by the fact, that the rock in which this plant is found 

 imbedded, and which constituted its matrix, presents an entirely different appear- 

 ance in color, and in some degree in lithological character, from that which fills 

 the interior of the fossil tree. Although there were numerous, but irregular 

 longitudinal flutings, both along the main irunk and its branches, yet I could 

 discover no indications of those beautiful scars, so characteristic of arborescent 

 ferns, and of the genus Sigillaria, which indicate the spots where the petioles 

 of the leaves articulated with the stem ; and hence I infer that this tree should 

 not be referred to either of those families of plants. 



The question naturally arises, to which of the three great divisions of the 

 vegetable kingdom do these fossil trees belong. Do they belong to arborescent 

 ferns, gigantic palms or lofty pines ? Are they of exogenous or endogenous 

 growth ? 



It has been said by fossil botanists, that true exogena? and endogenae have been 

 found in the carboniferous rocks of Europe. I have, therefore, been much inter- 

 ested in discovering some clear indications of these highest forms of vegetable 

 structure, in the coal measures in this country ; but 1 have thus far failed, unless 

 the specimens to which I have already alluded, should on further examination, 

 prove exceptions. 



I am aware that M. Brongniart has placed the Sigillariae among the exogenae, 

 but with all due deference to his high authority, I must say that I have been 

 unable to find in that family of fossil plants any evidence of pith, bark, con- 

 centric rings, medullary rays, or other indications of so high a structure. 



Since writing the above,! have made another examination of the specimens of 

 fossil trees, and believe that I was at first mistaken in regard to some of them 

 being branches. The rock in which they were found had been blasted, and 

 consequently the fossil trees were much broken. The largest entire piece which 

 I saw was not more than four or five feet in length. These facts may have 

 some bearing upon their position in the vegetable scale.

Description of fossil fruit found in the Carboniferous BocJcs of Beaver County , Pa* 

 By Alfred T. Kijxg, M. D., of Greensburg, Pa. 



Mr. Mendenhall, of New Brighton, showed me several specimens of fossil 

 fruit imbedded in solid sandstone, belonging to the carboniferous series of that 

 neighborhood. And through the kindness of George W. Tyler, Esq., editor of 

 the Boston Herald, I procured a specimen for description. 



These specimens bore considerable resemblance, both in form and size, to the 

 fruit of the Butternut, Juglans cinerea. 



There have been found in the coal strata in Leicestershire, England, a number 

 of species of a three cornered fruit, to which the generic name Higonocarpum 

 has been given. Possibly, the specimen which I am about to describe, may be 

 referred to that genus. 



This is a drupaceous fruit, of an ovoidal shape, from two inches and a quar- 

 ter to three inches in length, and from one inch and three quarters to two 

 inches and a half in breadth, and weighs from two and a quarter to three ounces* 

 Its external surface is nearly covered with a thin coating of bituminous coal ; a 

 large portion of which, however, adheres to its matrix. This coal was formed, I 

 presume, by the carbonization of its pericarp. Its interior is filled with coarse 

 grained sand, similar to the rock in which it was imbedded. The epicarp 

 i formed of three nearly equal valves, joined by three prominent sutures, uniting 

 in a point at the apex. Between the sutures are seen a number of nearly parallel 

 and prominent longitudinal striae, which gracefully curve so as to meet in a point 

 at the distal extremity. 



In all the specimens which I saw, there is a deep depression or excavation at 

 the base, where the fruit was attached, in all probability, to a peduncle. 



This fruit is not triquetrous, as the name Trigonocarpum seems to indicate, but 

 strictly ovoidal, sometimes nearly obovoidal, having three prominent sutures 

 joining the three valves of the epicarp. 



It was found in Beaver County, Pa., about three miles from the town of New 

 Brighton, in a thick stratum of compact, but coarse grained sandstone, near the 

 middle of the carboniferous series. 



Should this belong to the genus Trigonocarpum^ 1 propose calling it Trigono- 

 carpum carbonariwm.

 neck before and behind, and of the back, pare white at their bases and for about 

 two-thirds of their length, being, in fact, white tipped with black. Bill and feet 

 black. Iris yellowish brown. 



Total length from tip of bill to end of tail 18! ; wing 13i ; expanse of wings 

 33; tail 8 inches. 



Locality. State of Tamaulipas, Mexico; March, 1853.

 dated April 20th, 1854, acknowledging the receipt of an entire copy of 

 the Publications of the Academy, presented in accordance with a late 

 resolution. 



Also a letter from the American Philosophical Society, dated April

May 9 th. 

 Vice-President Bridges in the Chair. 



Dr Le Conte presented a paper for publication in the Proceedings, 

 entitled " Synopsis of the Cucuiides of the United States," which was 

 referred to Mr. Cassin, Dr. Zantzinger, and Dr. Rand. 



Dr. Le Conte exhibited a fragment of the jaw of a new Pachyderm 

 from the Tertiary of Virginia, 80 or 90 miles S. W. of Alexandria, and 

 characterised it as a new genus allied to Dicotyles. 



Mr. Wm. Parker Foulke asked the attention of the Academy to a Lecture by 

 Mr. Hugh Miller, recently republished in the United States, under the title, " The 

 Two Records, the Mosaic and the Geological ;" and made some remarks upon the 

 importance of maintaining a careful scrutiny of the logic of the natural sciences. 

 The cultivators of those sciences are particularly interested at this time in pre- 

 venting any misapprehension of the results of their researches, as there is a 

 prevailing disposition to " reconcile " these by extreme processes with the 

 popular interpretation of certain texts of the Mosaic history. Unfinished inves- 

 tigations of the students of nature are used as complete evidence ; and provisional 

 generalizations are employed as fixed premises, from which are drawn conclusions 

 very inconvenient to subsequent inquirers and writers. Thus both religion and 

 natural science are wronged. 



Mr. Miller teaches that in the attempt to reconcile the two "records," there 

 are only three periods to be accounted for by the geologist, viz., " the period of 

 plants, the period of great sea monsters and creeping things : and the period of 

 cattle and leasts of the field ;" that the first of these " periods " is represented by 

 the rocks grouped under the term palceozoic, and is distinguished from the secondary 

 and the tertiary, chiefly by its " gorgeous flora ;" and that " the geological evi- 

 dence is so complete as to be patent to all, that the first great period of organized 

 being was, as described in the Mosaic record, peculiarly a period of herbs and 

 trees yielding seed after their kind." The general reader, not familiar with the 

 details of geological arrangement, could not fail to infer from such a statement, 

 used for such a purpose, that the palaeozoic rocks are regarded by geologists as 

 forming one group, representative of one period which can properly be said to be 

 distinguished as a whole by its gorgeous flora ; and that it is properly so dis- 

 tinguished for the argument in question. It was familiar to the Academy as well 

 as to Mr. Miller, that from the carboniferous rocks downward (backward in order 

 of time) there have been discriminated a large number of periods differing one 

 from another in mineral and in organic remains; and that the proportion of the 

 carboniferous era to the whole series is small, whether we regard the thickness 

 of its deposits or its conjectural chronology. It is only of this carboniferous era, 

 the latest of this series, that the author's remarks could be true ; and even of this, 

 if taken for the entire surface of the earth, it could not be truly asserted that

70 [May, 



" the evidence is so complete as to be patent to all ,5 that the quantity of its 

 vegetable products distinguishes it from the earth's surface during the era in which 

 we live. To confound by implication all the periods termed palaeozoic, so as to 

 apply to them as a whole what could be true, if at all, only of the carboniferous 

 period, is a fallacious use of a generalization made for a purpose and upon a 

 principle not properly available for the writer's argument. The high esteem in 

 which the character of Mr. Miller is deservedly held by readers in the United 

 States, where his writings are widely circulated ; and the respectful manner in 

 which his interesting researches have occasioned his name to be mentioned by 

 authors eminent in the department of geology, give to such of his writings as 

 bear upon the biblical question, peculiar importance with reference to the com- 

 munity at large. 



Mr. F- urged the duty of insisting upon the maintenance of regular methods 

 of exposition as well as of investigation, leaving apparent inconsistencies, 

 which are beyond our means of explanation, to be "reconciled" by our 

 successors with the aid of larger accumulations of knowledge than we possess. 

 The progress of science has been retarded by the assumption that every discovery 

 must be immediately proved to be harmonious with certain other portions of our 

 knowledge. A due regard to the sacredness of religious faith and to the natural 

 sensitiveness of the popular mind will secure respectful caution; but it is most 

 consistent with the acknowledged imperfection of human faculties, and at the 

 same time most worthy of the true dignity of science, to assume that ultimately 

 all truths will be found to agree ; and meantime, strictly adhering to the canons 

 of evidence, to explore courageously the great field open to us. We ought espe- 

 cially to avoid generalizations which have no sound philosophical principle, or 

 which are framed or applied merely from a desire to appease over-zealous minds 

 ignorant of the facts already ascertained. This obligation is stronger in propor- 

 tion to the degree of confidence given to the teacher in any case, and also in 

 proportion to the limitation of access to other sources of information.

 Mr. Cassin, Dr. Ruschenberger and Dr. Leidy. 



Dr. Le Conte also presented a paper from Mr. Charles Grirard, on a 

 new species of Salmonidae from the Northeastern part of the United 

 States, which was referred to Dr. Le Conte, Dr. Leidy, and Dr. Hallowell. 



Dr. Brinton desired to draw the attention of the Academy to a new mode which 

 he had recently devised and practised in the preparation of anatomical specimens, 

 several of which he exhibited. 



Anatomical specimens, he said, had hitherto been preserved either in the wet 

 state, or else dried ; both plans were open to objections. 



If animal tissues be immersed in alcohol, or other preservative fluids, their color 

 becomes blanched, their structure condensed, and consequently their size and 

 shape to a certain degree modified ; and at the same time they present incon- 

 veniences for demonstration ; whilst in the dry state, as for example, in the ordin- 

 ary dried preparation of our cabinets, the parts are so shrunken and changed, as 

 to convey but an imperfect idea of their primitive relations. 



As this shrinkage of the tissues, and the decomposition are dependent most 

 probably upon atmospheric influence, Dr. Brinton stated that it had occurred to 

 him some time since, that should he be able so to exclude the air, as to prevent 

 all evaporation from taking place, he would perhaps succeed in preventing, not 

 only the desiccation of the part, but also its decomposition. 



Influenced by this idea, he had commenced a series of experiments, and the suc- 

 cess up to this time accompanying them, had led him to draw the attention of 

 the Academy to the subject. 



His object being to encase hermetically every portion of his specimen, Dr. 

 Brinton remarked that he had selected for his earlier experiments, a solution of 

 gun cotton in ether, the ordinary collodion. This he applied by means of a brush 

 over every portion of the external surface of his preparation. The ether quickly 

 evaporating, a thin film of the cotton was deposited upon and in all the interstices 

 of the tissue. This process was repeated until a layer of sufficient thickness had 

 been obtained; successive coatings of copal and shellac varnishes were then ap- 

 plied, so as to rentier to the preparation a certain degree of firmness and stiffness. 



But it soon became evident to him that collodion was not entirely suited for the 

 generality of objects, especially for those of any considerable bulk. It possesses 

 too slight a degree of tenacity, and is liable to become easily chipped and 

 fissured. 



It was necessary, therefore, to employ some other material, and a solution 

 of gutta-percha in benzole was selected ; this was applied in a similar 

 manner over the object to be preserved. The pellicle left by the evapora- 

 tion of the benzole was tenacious, dense, and could be increased to any de- 

 sired thickness. Single layers were transparent, suiting admirably for layers of 

 fasciae. For the encasement of the adipose tissue, collodion was still employed. 



The thick coating, however, which it was considered necessary to apply upon 

 the muscular mass, was of course opaque ; hence, it became of importance to re- 

 sort to an artificial coloring process, and for this purpose, collodion stained with 

 the wood of the Pterocarpus santalinus, (the ordinary red saunders,) was found 

 to answer admirably. The color resulting imitated closely that of fresh muscle. 

 The preparation was then completed by the repeated application of copal and 

 shellac varnishes. . 



Dr. Brinton explained to the Academy, that he did not present his specimens 

 as tried and perfected preparations, for as yet they had attained the age of but 

 some twenty days ; but merely as evidences of the application of a new principle 

 to the preparation of anatomical objects. Time was required to test its value. 



Whether or not any internal decomposition could take place in consequence of 

 the retention of a residual amount of air, Dr. Brinton could not state; but he 

 doubted that such would be the case, to a degree sufficient to affect the contour 

 of the specimen. Should, however, such a result ensue with regard to the speci- 

 mens upon the table, still his experiments had shown that the process was ap- 




72 



[May, 



plicable to any tissues which had been injected or soaked with a solution of 

 the chloride of zinc, or any other antiseptic. Here decomposition would be 

 impossible, and the gutta-percha was certainly sufficient to prevent the shrinking 

 consequent on evaporation. 



Dr. Brinton then stated that he was still experimenting, and had succeeded in 

 procuring a colorless solution of gutta-percha in benzole and in chloroform, 

 which would supersede the use of the collodion for the adipose matter. These 

 transparent solutions would doubtless be applicable to the preparation of dissec- 

 tions of the nervous system, and to pathological structures. He stated also that 

 he thought possibly an extension of this principle might hereafter be made sub- 

 servient to the preservation of any fresh animal tissue. Further results would 

 be submitted to the Academy.

Dr. Le Conte presented a paper by Mr. C. Girard, and intended for pub- 

 lication, entitled " A list of North American Bufonides, with diagnoses 

 of new species." Referred to Dr. Hallowell, Dr. Leidy,and Mr. Hanson. 



Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to specimens of four vertebras 

 of a huge extinct saurian, from near Greenville, Clark Co., Arkansas. They had 

 been kindly loaned by Mr. W. F. Roberts, an agent of the Arkansas Mining 

 Company, who had discovered them with numerous others. Dr. L. stated, 

 that in his late visit to St. Louis, Mr. Albert Koch, the industrious collector of 

 fossil remains, had exhibited to him a collection of bones from the same State, 

 and apparently of the same animal, which he was on the eve of sending to Berlin. 

 The specimens on the table are remarkable for the robust transverse processes, 

 which project laterally from the lower part of the body, and terminate in a large 

 facet for the articulation of a rib. The bodies are cylindroid, and are terminated 

 by slightly concave or nearly flat articular surfaces. The sides of the body are 

 moderately concave, and have an acute margin at the articular surfaces. On 

 each side of a median prominence pf the under side of the body a large vascular 

 foramen exists. 



These vertebrae resemble those of the Cirnoliasaurus mag?ius, from the green 

 sand of New Jersey, described previously in the Proceedings of the Academy,* 

 but in that the large transverse process is cylindrical, while it is compressed 

 cylindroid in the Arkansas saurian, and probably this latter belongs to a distinct 

 genus, for which the name Brimosaitrus grandis is proposed. The bones are 

 embedded in a hard limestone with mollusca, and they probably belong to the 

 cretaceous or to the eocene period. One of the most perfect of the vertebroe 

 presents the following measurements :

Middle, Southern and Western States. This species varies in size from -18 to 

 55 of an inch. The posterior angles of the thorax are usually prominent, on 

 account of the sinuosity of the sides near the base ; sometimes this sinuosity is 

 very faint, then the posterior angles, although rectangular, are not prominent. 

 Newman's C. punctic-ollis (Ann. Nat. Hist. 2, 398) is described as having 

 but 6 striae on each elytron, (the 5th and 6th stria? are said to be indistinct.) Now, 

 in some specimens, which cannot be separated from C. rufus, the fifth and sixth 

 striae are not well marked, but in all that I have seen the seventh stria is quite 

 obvious. As the elytra are declivous at the sides beyond the seventh stria, I 

 think it probable that this seventh stria is constant in the gpnus, in which case 

 there is no reason why Newman's species should not be united with C. rufus.

 very fine striae, on which are placed moderately large punctures; the interstitial 

 spaces are marked with a few very fine punctures, which on the sutural space 

 form a somewhat regular series ; their color is black, with a large, common, tri- 

 angular, rufous spot at the base, which along the suture extends one-third the 

 .length; the apical margin is slightly reddish. The scutellum is transverse, 

 without any distinct apical angle.

Louisiana and Georgia, Dr. Schaum. The outer stria of the thorax is distinct, 

 but does not reach the base. The antennae of the female are two thirds as long, 

 those of the male almost as long as the body ; the first joint is equal to the two 

 following united in the female, and is a little longer in the male. This species 

 is very closely related to the last, but seems, by the difference in the form of the 

 thorax and by the differences in the antennae and elytra, to be properly sepa- 

 rated.

 than the body, and the elytra are shorter than in the female. The first joint of 

 the antennae in both sexes is as long as the two following united.

Colorado River, California, abundant. The head is very finely punctulate, 

 and is distinctly channelled posteriorly; the discoidal impression of the thorax 

 is very faint, but it causes the anterior margin, in particular lights, to appear 

 slightly elevated. The male only differs from the female by the broader head 

 and longer and thinner antennae ; in both sexes, the first joint of the latter, al- 

 though thicker, is but little longer than the second.

A very singular species, of which I found but a single male at the Colorado 

 River, in California. The head is quadrate, with parallel sides, and without im- 

 pressions ; the usual marginal line is distinct. The mandibles project beyond 

 the labrum, and are about half as long as the head, the tip is emarginate. The 

 labrum is broad and slighrly emarginate ; the antennae are more than half as long 

 as the body ; the first joint is not much larger than the second, but the last three 

 joints are distinctly larger than the preceding and subtriangular. The scuiel is 

 triangular. The under surface of the body is black, with the antennae and feet 

 piceous.

 a very slender curved horn, which converges upwards to meet the one of the 

 opposite side. The upper surface of the body is sometimes entirely black ; some- 

 times the head, thorax and margin of the elytra are brown.

Georgia, not rare. Differs from the preceding by the thorax being not dis- 

 tinctly transverse, less strongly toothed at the sides, with the anterior angles 

 acute, but very slightly produced ; by the stria of the elytra being less punc- 

 tured, and by the sides being almost perpendicular. The sexual characters are 

 as in the preceding.

California (San Jose,) and Russian America (according to Motschulsky.) This 

 species has the thorax formed almost as in the preceding, the anterior angles being 

 a little more produced ; the elytra are, however, deeply striate, with the inter- 

 stices more rough with elevated punctures; they are also more strongly carinate 

 towards the side. The sexual characters as in the preceding species, but in ad- 

 dition, the elytra of the male are longer, and obliquely slightly sinuated at the 

 apex.

 It is now diffused over the whole globe in articles of commerce. Erichson adopts, 

 from Fabricius, the specific name frumentarius for it, but the oldest des- 

 cription is certainly that of Linnaeus. Of the descriptions by the older authors, 

 the chronological succession is as follows :

Colorado River, California, under poplar bark. The sides of the thorax are 

 almost parallel anteriorly, and subangulated at the middle ; the anterior angles 

 are scarcely prominent, and the posterior ones are obtuse. The disc is marked 

 with two faint longitudinal impressions connected at the base. The elytra are 

 not wider than the head, and the rows of punctures become obsolete towards 

 the tip. The head is as broad as the thorax, flattened and finely but not densely 

 punctulate.

One specimen from Illinois, Mr. Willcox. The punctures of the head and

Abundant throughout the United States, in articles of commerce, herbaria, 

 &c. This species, although placed by several entomologists in the present genus, 

 has so much the form of Paramecosoma, that any person would be tempted to 

 refer it to that genus. The first joint of the abdomen is not longer than the 

 second, and therefore, according to Erichson's definition, it would be excluded 

 from the family of Cryptophagides. 



In this essay must be included the description of a remarkable insect, of which 

 my unique specimen is in such a bad condition, that I am unable to determine 

 whether it should be referred to any described genus, or even to indicate its po- 

 sition in the group ; from its specific characters, I suspect a relation with Pedi-

acus, but the size of the eyes and the form of the thorax are very different. I 

 retain for it the name which appears in Dejean's Catalogue.

Georgia. The antennae are longer than the head and thorax, with turbinate 

 joints, gradually increasing in size ; the first joint is thickened, and is longer 

 than the two following united. The last joint of the maxillary palpi is larger 

 than the penultimate and apparently acute at tip. The angles of the thorax are 

 all rounded ; the posterior foveae are oblong, slightly oblique, and about as far 

 from the sides as from the base. 



Notice of some Coleopterous Insects, from the Collections of the Mexican Boun- 

 dary Commission. 



By John L. Le Conte, M. D. 



This paper includes descriptions of some new species contained in collections 

 received from the Boundary Commission immediately before the completion of 

 the survey, and with the collections previously made by the active and enter- 

 prising naturalists attached to the expedition, will enable a moderately full 

 Coleopterous Fauna of the lower Rio Grande to be prepared. 



Of the species noted below, some were collected between Laredo and Ring- 

 cold barracks, by Messrs. Schott and Weise, under the command of Major Emory. 

 Those from Frontera, Rio Grande, were collected by Mr. J. D. Clark, under Major 

 Graham : a few others were obtained by Mr. Clark at San Antonio, in Texas. 

 Some very interesting species from Fort Union, New Mexico, collected by Major 

 Sibley, are also added, although not belonging properly to the Boundary fauna: 

 and one from Dr. Cooper's collection in Oregon, which was omitted in my de- 

 scription of his species. 



Cicindela punc tul ata and albohir ta. Frontera; Mr. Clark. 



Cicindela 16-punctata Klug. Jahrb. 32. Frontera; Mr. Clark. This 

 species resembles very closely C. Hentzii, nor does there appear in Klug's de- 

 scription any character which would separate it from that species. The law of 

 representative forms is abundantly exemplified in the species of this genus, and 

 much careful investigation will be necessary to determine what are well defined 

 limits of the species. 



C. bland a? A species closely resembling this was also found by Mr. Clark 

 at Frontera. 



Pasimachus costifer, niger, nitidus; thoracis elytrisque marginibus cyanes- 

 centibus, illo postice angustato, lateribus postice sinuatis angulis posticis rectis, 

 his modice convexis, laevibus, carina humerali postice obsolete continuata, cos- 

 taque submarginali acuta utrinque paulo abbreviata ornatis : antennarum arti- 

 culis 2 et 3 compressis. Long 1-05 1-2. 



Dr. Weise, Laredo to Ringgold Barracks. This species has the same form 

 as P. depressus and pnnctulatus, but the sharply elevated costa between the 

 margin and the obsoletely prolonged humeral carina will readily distinguish it, 

 The mandibles are slightly rugous. 



Harpalus i m p i ge r, niger, nitidus, elongatus, thorace latitudine paulo bre- 

 viore, paulo convexo, postice angustato, lateribus rotundatis, angustemarginatis, 

 basi subemarginata punctulata, utrinque subimpressa, angulis posticis obtusis 

 non rotundatis, elytris thorace vix latioribus, profunde striatis, unipunctatis, apice 

 sinuatis, antennis palpis pedibusque ferrugineis. Long. '52 G5. 



Santa Fe, New Mexico, Mr. Fendler : Frontera, Mr. Clark. This species is 

 comparatively almost as elongated as H. erraticus, but the thorax is more 




80 [May, 



narrowed posteriorly, the lateral margin is narrower, and the elytra of the female 

 are not toothed near the apex : the posterior angles of the thorax are slightly 

 prominent, and almost rectangular. 



Phileurus cribrosus, ater, nitidus, convexus, clypeo marginato apice acute 

 elevato, ante oculos transversim carinato, thorace transverso, parcius punctato, 

 pone medium canalieulato, elytris punctis grossis seriatim positis. Long. -52. 



Laredo to Ringgold Barracks; Mr. Weise. This curious little species seems 

 to have most affinity with those of Burmeisters division {& (2)) ;* the anterior 

 tibia? have three large external teeth, the mandibles are without any prominent 

 external tooth, and the elytra without any short series of punctures near the 

 scutellum. It differs, however, from all those described by Burmeister in hav- 

 ing in place of the two usual frontal tubercles a transverse ridge, scarcely emar- 

 ginate at the middle. The prosternal prominence is small, acute and densely 

 pilose. 



At Vallecitas, in California, I found the elytra and thorax of a species which 

 seems on comparison very similar to the specimen found by Mr. Weise, but be- 

 longs to a section of the genus having a short stria at the base of the elytra, be- 

 tween the first and second stria: the punctures of the elytra are more closely 

 set, so as to form striae ; the thorax is more densely punctured anteriorly, and 

 almost smooth posteriorly : the dorsal channel extends almost to the apex, but is 

 not deep, and finally the anterior tibiae above the three long teeth have an indis- 

 tinct prominence representing a fourth tooth. The length was about '65 of an 

 inch. The species may be called P. i 1 1 a t u s. 



Athyreus ser r a tu s, ferrugineus, nitidus, clypeo antice truncato elevato, 

 vertice transversim elevato, thorace lateribus rotundatis serrulatis, antice valde 

 declivi, et medio late impresso, carinis utrinque duabus obliquis munito, apice 

 valde marginato, elytris tenuiter striato-punctatis, antennis flavis. Long. -54. 



One specimen, Laredo to Ringgold Barracks. The head is finely scabrous ; 

 the clypeus is truncate and perpendicular at the apex, which forms a subtrian- 

 gular facet; each side above the eye commences an elevated line, which runs for- 

 ward to the angle of the lateral emargination of the clypeus, then in a curve 

 runs to the apex, where it unites with the elevated edge of the triangular facet 

 above mentioned : the vertical horn is very short and transverse. The thorax 

 is sparsely punctulate, with a few large punctures along the middle, and in the 

 concavities: each side at the middle is a broad transverse sulcus, limited ante- 

 riorly by an elevated line ; anterior to this the disc is very declivous, with the 

 anterior margin strongly elevated; at the middle of this declivous face is a shal- 

 low impression, and again each side a deeper excavation, between which and 

 the first mentioned elevated line is a strong somewhat oblique elevated ridge : 

 the sides are regularly rounded and serrate, the anterior angles are acute. The 

 striae of the elytra are fine and moderately punctured ; the interstices are very 

 sparsely punctulate. The under surface and the legs are furnished with long 

 yellow hairs. 



Although this is the first authentic appearance of the genus Athyreus in our 

 fauna, I find on comparison that Bolbocerus fossatus Hald. (Proc. Acad. 6, 

 362,) and Scarabaeus ferrugineus Beauv. (Ins. 90, tab. 2b, fig. 3,) also be- 

 long here; the middle coxa? in both of those species are separated, and the meso- 

 sternum is somewhat elevated, acutely margined at the sides and declivous ante- 

 riorly. In his beautiful monograph of Athyreus, Klug suggests that the species 

 of Beauvois just mentioned belongs to this genus, although in the absence of 

 specimens for examination, this opinion could not be confirmed.

 long as the remaining portion. A nearly allied species from Wisconsin, given 

 me by Mr. Guex, may be thus described.

One specimen, Frontera (Rio Grande), Mr. Clark. This species differs from 

 H. lithophilus, by the thorax being longer, and scarcely narrowed anteriorly, 

 and by the fine punctures of thorax and elytra being very distinct: the striae of the 

 latter can hardly be traced. Its characters approach most closely to H. Gilensis 

 Lee. (Pro. Acad. 6, 43), a species of a broader form, and with very distinct lines 

 of punctures upon the elytra.

One specimen, Laredo to Ringgold Barracks, Mr. Schott. The general form 

 and appearance is that of C undulata, but the thorax is not constricted poste- 

 riorly and is less sinuate on the sides, and the punctures of the elytra are much 

 larger.

 stitiis angustis parce punctulatis, antennis capite thoraceque paulo longioribus, 

 extrorsum paulo incrassatis, articulis turbinatis, ultimo longiore cylindrico. 

 Long. *38. 



One specimen found with the preceding. Remarkable for the strange form of 

 the antennas, and for the sudden narrowing of the thorax behind the middle : 

 there is however, no posterior transverse impression, except the constriction in 

 the sides : the middle of the base is slightly elevated and marked with an oblong 

 fovea. It is closely related to C. brunnea Mels., but is smaller, with the thorax 

 much more narrowed behind. 



Elaphidion t a e n i a t u m, fuseo-piceum, tenuiter fusco-pubescens, thorace

 corpore brevioribus, articulis 3 6 apice breviter unispinosis. Long. -95. 



One specimen, Mr. Schott. In form resembles E. atomarium, but is not quite 

 so robust: the thorax is scabrous with large punctures, the dorsal callosities are, 

 as usual, three in number, one medial elongated, the others each side in front of 

 the middle. The head around and between the eyes is densely pubescent with 

 whitish hair : the elytra are moderately shining, the punctures are not very 

 dense and become very small towards the apex. The thighs are not armed.

Laredo to Ringgold Barracks, Mr. Schott. Remarkable for its very slender 

 form, in which it almost equals E. unicolor, (Stenoc. unicolor Randall) : the 

 fourth joint of the antennas is armed with a very minute spine : the following 

 joints are unarmed, as are the femora: the spine of the third joint extends two- 

 thirds the length of the fourth joint. The elytra are truncate at tip, but the 

 truncate part is slightly emarginate, in such manner that the angles become a 

 little prominent. The antennae of the male are longer, those of the female 

 shorter than the body. 



Oncideres pustulatus, niger, pube brevi fusca dense vestitus, thorace bre-

Laredo, Mr. Schott. The anterior spots of the elytra are elevated, those be- 

 hind the middle are flat.

 antennis longissimis cinereis, articulis 1 5 apice fuscis, 5to fasciculo apicali 

 interno recurvato ornato. Long. *91. 



Fort Union, Major Sibley. The first five joints of the antennae are densely 

 clothed beneath with fine short erect hair : the apex of the fourth joint is hardly 

 thickened, but at the apex of the fifth joint is an internal brush of long yellowish 

 hairs, w T hich are recurved, so as to form a hooked prominence. The form of the 

 thorax in this species is quite different from A. nodosus, and is more similar to 

 Monohammus, the spine being perpendicular, and the disc more cylindrical : it 

 ought probably to form a new genus, but as the arrangement of the genera of 

 Longicorns is still very unsatisfactory, it is needless for the present to separate 

 species that are obviously allied.

Prairie Paso, Oregon, Dr. Cooper. This very .fine insect seems allied to 

 Necydalis ; it differs, however, by its less constricted neck, and by the propor- 

 tions of the joints of the antennae, also by its stouter form : the elytra diverge 

 more posteriorly, showing a tendency towards a subulate form. The scutel is 

 smooth and shining, with the sides hairy : the pectus is thinly clothed with gray- 

 ish hairs.

Laredo to Ringgold Barracks, Mr. Weise. Resembles closely M. c i 1 ip e s 

 Hald., but the sides of the thorax are less serrate, and less reflexed: the disc is 

 also less convex, the mandibles are not elongated, but thick, and emarginate at 

 the end; those of the male of M. cilipes are similar in form.

Laredo to Ringgold Barracks. Mr. Schott. The arrangement of Buprestidae 

 is at present in such confusion, that I am unable, by the books, to determine the 

 proper reference of this species. Generic characters of much importance in this 

 family have been lost sight of in the arrangements proposed, and a thorough re- 

 vision is necessary. This particular species has for generic characters : clypeus 

 broadly but regularly emarginate ; the antennae inserted under a strongly elevated 

 line which runs obliquely towards the emargination of the clypeus ; the labrum 

 emarginate; the mentum rounded anteriorly; the scutel small, transverse and 

 rounded : coxal plates much but gradually dilated internally : rnesosternum di- 

 vided, with the portions entirely connate with the metasternum : palpi almost 

 cylindrical, with subequal joints : anus very slightly emarginate : tarsi with the 

 joints 1 4 broadly lobed, the lobe of the fourth joint rounded : the basal joint of 

 the posterior tarsi very little longer than the second: the mandible are thick, 

 short and obtuse.

Frontera (Rio Grande), Mr. Clarke. Although having very much the form of 

 Anthaxia, this species differs considerably in its generic characters ; the an- 

 tennre palpi and feet are unfortunately wanting, but the following marks will 

 enable the genus to be recognized : 



The antennae are near the eyes, (which are moderate in size) and are inserted 

 on the front : behind the insertion is a deep fovea, at the bottom of which is a 

 round shining tubercle* (as in Dicerca) ; the clypeus is very broadly emarginate 

 in the arc of a circle, (labrum wanting) ; the mandibles are short, thick and ob- 

 liquely truncate; the mentum is broaci and rounded anteriorly; the rnesosternum 

 firmly connate with the metasternum; the posterior coxal plates with the poste- 

 rior outline concave so as to form an internal tooth; anus not emarginate ; scutel 

 very small, subtriangular. 



The yellow margin of the thorax is posteriorly separated from the disc by an 

 impressed line : the yellow of the elytra is slightly dilated behind the humerus 

 nd again about the middle.

 Long. 65. 



Fort Union, New Mexico, Major Sibley. This beautiful species is nearly of 

 the same form as our common black P. longipes, but is less acute posterior- 

 ly : the yellow lines of the elytra are arranged so as to include the following 

 spots : a large common triangular one at the scutel, separated from the base by 

 the red margin ; an elongated lateral spot extending from behind the humerus to 

 two-fifths the length: a large common rhomboidal spot on the suture, extending 

 from the second to the fourth fifth of the length : immediately opposite the ex- 

 ternal angle of the rhomboid, a small submarginal black dot , finally a large api- 

 cal blotch ; separated from the rhomboid by a narrow yellow line, and from the 

 margin by the red marginal line above mentioned. The yellow stripes which 

 bound the anterior faces of the rhomboid are considerably broader than the

Laredo to Ringgold Barracks, Mr. Weise. The sides of the thorax are strongly 

 margined, and furnished with long hairs : the base and apex are ciliate as usual 

 with short bristles: the disc is entirely without punctures: the slightly elevated 

 lines of the elytra in one specimen can hardly be observed.

One specimen, Laredo to Ringgold Barracks, Mr. Weise. This species agrees 

 in its characters very closely with the two California species described in the 

 Annals of the Lyceum of New York, (5, 129) the mentum is however more flat- 

 tened, slightly carinate at base, and impressed anteriorly ; the antennas are less 

 slender, and the joints are more distant, and the last joint is not truncate, but 

 oval and pointed, and but little smaller than the tenth joint. A close affinity to 

 Centrioptera is also seen, but that genus has less produced prosternum, and" the 

 mentum is not emarginate.

Laredo to Ringgold Barracks, Mr. Schott. Closely related to A. punctulata

 moderately distant, the third joint of the antennae equal to the fourth, and the 

 penultimate joint of all the tarsi lobed.

Fort Union, New Mexico, Major Sibley. Probably a female : the antennae are 

 not filiform as in M. angusticollis Say, nor thicker in the middle as in M. im- 

 pressus Klrly, but are very gradually thickened to the end : the third joint is 

 not longer than the fourth, and is about twice the size of the second. The inner 

 spur of the posterior tibiae is acute, the outer one is larger, concave and obtuse. 

 This species approaches the Western American M. strigulosus Mann., but the 

 thorax is not so much elongated, the sides are nearly straight, and the base less 

 emarginate.

One specimen, Frontera, (Rio Grande) Mr. Clark. The antennae are slender 

 and filiform : the first joint is equal in length to the third ; the second is about one 

 half as long; from the third the joints diminish gradually in length : the inner 

 spur of the posterior tibiae is acute, the outer one is broader, obtuse and con- 

 cave. The labrum is slightly emarginate. It belongs in division (B g.) of 

 Proc. Acad. 6, 331.

Laredo to Ringgold Barracks, Mr. Weise. In the male, the first joint of the 

 antennae is as long as the head, compressed, and angulated externally beyond the 

 middle but very slightly curved : the second joint is one half larger than the 

 third. In the female the first joint extends to the posterior margin of the eye, 

 and the second joint is about equal to the third. This species is allied to L. longi- 

 collis Lee. but the color of the cephalic organs, and the sexual characters distin- 

 guish it at first sight.

Notice of a new species of Salmo??idcB, from the north-eastern part of the 



United States. 



By Charles Gieard. 



The body of the male is subfusiform and rather slender, particularly the caudal 

 region ; the head being regularly subconical and contained five times in the total 

 length. The maxillaries are gently curved, extending backwards to about the 

 posterior margin of the orbit. The female is stouter, with the peduncle of the tail 

 shorter ; the head has the same general shape, but is not contained five times in 

 the total length. The maxillaries are less curved, but extend as far backwards 

 as in the male. The eye is very large ; its diameter being contained nearly five 

 times in the length of side of head. The caudal is deeply emarginated posteriorly, 

 giving to it a more forked appearance than in either Salmo oquassa or Salmo 

 sebago. The adipose fin, in the male, is situated opposite the anterior margin of 

 the anal, whilst in the female it corresponds to the posterior margin of the same 

 fin. 



The scales are well developed, being somewhat smaller, however, than in 

 Salmo sebago, and considerably larger than in either Salmo oquassa or Salmo 

 erythrogaster. On the dorsal and ventral regions they are considerably smaller 

 than upon the sides and along the peduncle of the tail. They extend, diminish- 

 ing in size, over nearly the half of the length of the middle rays of the caudal fin. 

 The lateral line takes an almost straight course along the middle region of the 

 flanks. The following is an approximate formula of the rays of the fins: 



D 3. 12. A 1. 9. C 8. I. 8. 9. I. 5. V 1. 9. P 14. 



There are two anterior rudimentary rays to the dorsal, one or two to the anal, 

 one to the ventrals, eight or ten to the upper lobe of the caudal, and five or six 

 to the inferior lobe. 



The uppnr surface of head and dorsal region are blackish brown; the sides are 

 silvery white, and the belly yellowish. The region above the lateral line is 

 densely spread all over with black irregular spots, some of which are confluent; 

 a few scattered ones may be seen beneath that line upon the middle of the abdo- 

 men. Four to six of these spots, w r ell defined, are always observed on the oper- 



8

culum, one of which may occasionally reach the preoperculum. A few reddish 

 orange dots, individually situated in the middle of a black spot, are occasionally 

 observed along the middle and upper part of the flanks. Whether these dots are 

 peculiar to the female or proper to both sexes, I am not prepared to say, from 

 want of sufficient information, upon that point. 



This species was first brought to my notice by M. Townend Glover, of Fish- 

 ki'i Landing, Dutchess Co., New York, who caught it in the upper affluent of 

 Union river, in the State of Maine, during the middle of September. I propose 

 for it the name of Salmo gloverii, as a token of gratitude towards an artist whose 

 labors, if promoted, would contribute so much to popularize natural history, and 

 spread its benefits throughout the country. 



A list of the North American Bufonids, with Diagnoses of New Species* 



By Charles Girard. 



1. Bufo americanus, Le Conte MS. Holbr. N. Amer. Herp. v. 1842, 17, 

 pi. iv. 



Inhabits the Atlantic States, from Maine to Virginia, extending through the 

 mountainous regions of the Carolinas into the valley of the Mississippi. It is 

 likewise found in the North Western States and Canada. 



2. Bufo lentiginosis, Holbr. N. Amer. Herp v. 1842, 7, pi. i. Rana 

 le7itigi?wsa, Shaw, Gen. Zool. iii. 1, 1803. 173. PI. liii. Bufo erythronotus , 

 Holbr. Ibid. 11. PI. ii. 



Ranges along the sea coast, from South Carolina to Florida, and following the 

 gulf through Alabama and Mississippi. Scattered individuals are met with 

 across the mountains to South Carolina. 



Bufo ctythrojiotus does not appear to us different from B. lentiginosus^ since 

 color alone cannot be taken as an exclusive guide amongst the bufonids. 



3. Bufo woodhousii, Girard. Bufo dorsalis, Hallow, (non Spix). Proc. 

 Acad. Nat. Sc. Philada. vi. 1852, 181 ; and in Sit.greaves Exped. Ziini and Color. 

 Rivers, 1853, 142. PI. xix. Head short and thick; upper central surface but 

 little depressed, not to say grooved ; the suborbital ridge being slightly elevated. 

 The occipito-temporal ridge is thicker, and hence a little more conspicuous. 

 Snout rounded, nostrils terminal. Mouth wide, upper jaw emarginated. Tym- 

 panum and parotids of moderate size. Limbs rather short and stout. First 

 finger much longer than the second. A large metacarpal disk. Toes semipal- 

 mated. Two metatarsal tubercles, a very large and a very small one. No 

 membranous fold at the inner lower edge of the tarsus. Papillae of medium 

 size upon the back. Inferior surface, with rather small and crowded granular 

 warts. Above dark brown, with numerous lines of yellow. A dorsal yellowish 

 vitta running the whole length of the body. Transverse blotches of black upon 

 the thighs and fore arms. Beneath ochraceus. 



The affinities of this species are intermediate between B. americaims and B. 

 lentiginoses. Its geographic range appears to be New Mexico, having so far 

 been found in the province of Sonora, and in the San Francisco mountains. 



4. Bufo cognatus, Say, in Long's Exped. to Rocky Mts. ii, 1823, 190. 

 Holbr. N. Amer. Herp. v. 1842, 21. PI. v. B. and G. in Marcy's Expl. Red 

 Riv. La. 1853. 242. Zool. PI. xi. 



A very characteristic species in the structure of the upper surface of head. 

 Found in the territory of Nebraska, and southwards as far as the province of 

 Coahuila, Mex. 



5. Bufo speciosus, Girard. Head moderate ; its upper surface smooth and 

 even, or with slight traces of ridges or carinae. Snout subtruncated and rounded; 

 nostrils subterminal. Mouth large, upper jaw slightly emarginated. Tongue 



* Specimens upon which these descriptions are based, are preserved in the 

 museum of the Smithsonian Institution, at Washington.

small, elongate, posteriorly free for the fourth of its length. A subgulav vocal 

 bladder. Tympanum of medium size. Parotids subovoid, of stoutish appear- 

 ance. Limbs of moderate development. First finger much longer than the 

 second, which is equal to the fourth. A large subcircular metacarpal disk. 

 Toes semipalmated. Two metatarsal spade-shaped processes, the innermost 

 being much the largest. A membranous fold at the inner lower margin of tar- 

 sus. Skin above covered with papillae of moderate development, and with small 

 warts beneath. Color above greenish brown, maculated: no dorsal lighter 

 vitta. Beneath, greenish or yellowish white, unicolor. 



Allied to B. woodhousii, differing, however, in the form and development of 

 the metatarsal processes. It appears to inhabit the valley of the Rio Bravo 

 (Rio Grand del Norte), and to be not uncommon in the province of New Leon. 



6. Bufo punctatus, B. and G. Acad. Nat. Sc. Philad. vi. 1852, 173. 



A very marked species in the shape and structure of the head. Hitherto 

 found in the valley of the Devil's river (Rio San Pedro, of Rio Grande), and in 

 the province of Coahuila, Mex. 



7. Bufo debilis, Girard. Upper surface of head without any crest or ridge. 

 Snout rounded. Mouth moderate. Upper jaw emarginated. Tongue small. 

 Tympanum small. Parotids moderate and elongated. Limbs of moderate de- 

 velopment, femur shorter than tibia. First finger longer than the second. A 

 large metacarpal disk. Toes slightly united at base by a web. Two metatar- 

 sal processes. No membranous fold at the inner lower margin of the tarsus. 

 Skin above pustulous; pustules of moderate development; warts beneath 

 very small. Color above brownish yellow, spotted. No dorsal lighter vitta. 

 Beneath of a uniform soiled yellow. 



Allied to B. speciosus ; found in the lower part of the valley of the Rio 

 Bravo ^Rio Grande del Norte), and in the province of Tamaulipas. 



8. Bufo nebulifer, Girard Bufo granulosus, B. and G. (non Spix). Proc. 

 Acad. Nat. Sc. Philad. vi. 1852, 173. 



This species is strongly suggestive of B. mariuus, Schn. (B. agna Daud) ; it 

 is, however, easily distinguished from it upon a comparison of individuals of 

 both species. It inhabits Texas, the valley of the Rio Bravo (Rio Grande del 

 Norte), the provinces of Tamaulipas and New Leon, Mexico. 



9. Bufo columbiensis, B. and G. Proc. Acad. Nat. Sc. Philad. vi. 1853, 

 378. 



This is possibly the largest species of North American toads; it is common in 

 the valley of the Columbia River, Oregon Territory, where it was first observed 

 by the naturalists of the U. S. Exploring Expedition under Capt. C. Wilkes. 



10. Bufo boreas, B. and G. Proc. Acad. Nat. Philad. vi. 1852, 311. 



So far the most northern bufonid ; it is not uncommon about Puget Sound, 

 where it was collected many years ago by the naturalists of the U. S. Explor- 

 ing Expedition. 



11. Bufo halophila, B. and G. Proc. Acad. Nat. Sc. Philada. vi. 1853, 

 311. 



Since this species was first described an adult individual has been secured, 

 which has enabled me to give the following diagnosis : 



Upper surface of head without either crests or grooves. Skin thick and adhering 

 to skull. Snout rounded. Parotids of medium size. Ryes moderate. Tym- 

 panum small. Tongue lanceolated, bro.idest posteriorly. Upper jaw emargi- 

 nated. Inner finger longer than the second. Two metacarpal disks. A mem- 

 branous fold along the tarsus. Toes semipalmated ; two metatarsal tubercles. 

 A narrow yellowish dorsal vitta. Ground color greenish yellow, with nume- 

 rous black spots and dots, distributed all over the upper parts and sides of body, 

 head and limbs. Beneath unicolor of a dingy yellow. 



Inhabits the western coast, frequenting the sea margin ; hitherto observed 

 only in California. 




88 [June, 



12. Bufo quercinus, Holbr. N. Amer. Herp. v. 1842, 13. PI. iii. 



This quite small species appears to be restricted to very narrow geographical 

 limits, having so far been found only in the neighborhood of Charleston, S. C. 



13. Bufo insidior, Girard. Upper surface of head plane and smooth. Snout 

 subacute, protruding. Mouth moderate, upper jaw slightly emarginated. 

 Tongue elongated, tapering towards both ends. Tympanum inconspicuous. 

 Parotids large and elongated, situated obliquely upon the shoulder. Limbs 

 moderate. First finger equal to the second in length. A metacarpal disk, and 

 a tubercle. Toes slightly webbed at base. Two metatarsal tubercles. Skin 

 papillous above, warty beneath. Above of a bluish slate hue, with black 

 markings. Beneath unicolor, dingy yellow. 



Small specimens, perhaps immature, were collected in Chihuahua by Dr. 

 Thos. H. Webb, attached to Comm. Bartlett's party in the survey of the U. 

 S. and Mex. boundary line.

 presenting the Indian remains deposited in the Cabinet by Mr. Ellet,

Dr. Hallowell presented for publication in the Proceedings, two papers, 

 entitled respectively, " Descriptions of New Reptiles from California ;" 

 and " On a genus and species of Serpent from Honduras, presumed to 

 be new," both of which were referred to Dr. Leidy, Dr. Le Conte, and 

 Col. McCall. 



Dr. Leidy stated that while examining some fossils he had accidentally in- 

 spected the fragment of lower jaw, supposed by Harlan to belong to an extinct 

 species of hog, the Sus americanns ; and which Prof. Owen, after an examination, 

 had considered as a new genus, Harlavus, allied to the tapiroid pachyderms, 

 when it immediately occurred to him that it belonged neither to a suiline nor a 

 tapiroid animal, but to a true ruminant, and this, the Bison latifrons. 



The form of the fragment of jaw is the same as the corresponding portion in 

 the ox, and its robustness is in relation to the size and strength of the head of 

 Bison latifrons. 



The fossil belonged to a very old individual, as indicated by the production of 

 large fangs to the teeth, and the almost entire removal of the enamelled crown 

 by trituration. 



The first of the series of true molars in the specimen exhibits two fangs of 

 dentine united by an isthmus of cementum, (see plate vi. accompanying Owen's 

 memoir, in vol. i. new series, of the Journal of this Academy.) 



In the second true molar a line of enamel yet borders the crown. The little 

 prominence in the centre of the dentinal space of the anterior lobe is the rem- 

 nant of the crescentic enamel island. The middle of the three folds on the outer 

 side, which misled Prof. Owen to suspect an affinity of the animal to Toxodon, 

 is nothing more than the remains of the robust accessory column of the molars 

 of Bison latifrons t as may be seen by comparing the specimens, or the figures in 

 Owen's plate, with the corresponding part in the figures 6 and 7 of the last molar 

 in plate ii. of my " Memoir on the Extinct Species of American Ox." 



The last molar of Bison latifrofis, indicated in the figures just mentioned, not 

 only exactly fits the corresponding space in the fragment of jaw, but the remain- 

 ing portion of tooth in the latter is of the same form and size as the correspond- 

 ing portion of the entire tooth. 



If these views be considered as correct, then the Sus americanns, or Harlanus 

 america?ius, ceases to be a distinct animal, and the fossil in question becomes a 

 portion of Bison latifrons. 



In further confirmation of these facts, a portion of a humerus and a tibia, 

 mentioned in Prof. Owen's paper, and an atlas and a metacarpal bone were dis- 

 covered by Mr. Couper, with the [fragment of jaw, and these had previously 

 been referred to Bison latifrons in my memoir above referred to.

[June, 



Dr. Leidy next called attention to several fossils indicating new species of 

 extinct mammalia. 



The first was the crown of a molar tooth discovered by Captain Bowman, 

 U. S. A., in the sands of Ashley river, S. C. It most resembles the left lower 

 penultimate molar of the bear, but the triturating surface is more generally 

 level, and presents less disposition to the formation of cusps. The specimen 

 measures 24 m.m. antero-posteriorly, and 17 m.m. transversely. For the genus 

 and species supposed to be indicated by the specimen the name of Aretodus pris- 

 tinus was proposed. 



The other fossils consisted of two specimens loaned by Prof. Hall, of Albany, 

 and constitute part of the collection made by Messrs. Meek and Hayden, during 

 an expedition to Nebraska Territory in the summer of 1853. They were found 

 on Bijou Hill, east of the Missouri River, in a tertiary formation surmounting 

 cretaceous beds. 



One of the specimens is an inferior molar of a solipedal animal, apparently 

 intermediate to Equus and Anchitherium, the enamel folding upon the triturating 

 surface being less complex than in the former, and greater than in the latter. 

 It appears to have had an envelope of crusta petrosa as in the horse, though 

 nearly all removed in the specimen. In size it is relatively long compared to 

 the corresponding teeth of A7ichitherium i but is short compared to those of 

 Equus. Its antero-posterior measurement in 17 m.m. For the genus and species 

 the name of Hippodon speciosus was proposed. 



The remaining specimen is the fragment of a lower jaw, containing a last pre- 

 molar and the first true molar of a small ruminant allied to the Musks. The 

 last premolar on the triturating surface presents a series of five folds projecting 

 inwardly. Its measurement antero-posteriorly is 8 m.m. The inner side of the 

 true molar is nearly as plain as in those of Pceb rot her item. Its measurement 

 antero-posteriorly is also 8 m.m. For the genus and species the name of Mery- 

 codus necatus was proposed.

June ISth. 

 Dr. Ruschenberger in the Chair. 



A letter was read from Dr. W. P. Gibbons, dated San Francisco, May 

 16, 1854, transmitting the specimens of viviparous fishes acknowledged 

 this evening; also a paper intended for publication in the Proceed- 

 ings, entitled, u Descriptions of four new species of Viviparous Fishes 

 from Sacramento River and the Bay of San Francisco. Read before 

 the California Academy of Natural Sciences, May 15th, 1854 ; by Wm. 

 P. Gibbons, M. D." 



Referred to Dr. Le Conte, Dr. Leidy, and Dr. Hallowell. 



Dr. Hallowell presented a paper for publication in the Proceedings, 

 entitled, " Remarks on the Geographical distribution of Reptiles, 

 with descriptions of several species supposed to be new, and corrections 

 of former papers ;" which was referred to Dr. Leidy, Dr. Da Costa, and 

 Dr. Le Conte. 



Dr. Da Costa directed the attention of the Academy to a new process which 

 he had lately employed in making minute injections. In order to insure a greater 

 rotundity and distinctness of the vessels than is usually obtained, he performed 

 a series of experiments with solid substances dissolved in ether, and as evidence 

 of the results he submitted several specimens to the inspection of the members. 

 The substances selected on account of their ready solubility were the resins, and 

 of these the sandarach and the Damarra copal were found to answer best. One 

 ounce of the resin was dissolved in about three ounces, or if mucous membranes 

 were to be injected, in about four ounces of ether. This was then filtered, and 

 enough finely ground yellow or red paint added to give to the injecting mass the 






1854.] 91 



requisite color. Judging from the equal distinctness of the vessels in some of 

 Prof. Hyrtl's preparations in his possession, he was led to believe that it is on a 

 similar principle that these beautiful injections are made, except that turpentine 

 is probably used as a solvent instead of ether. He was, however, not able to 

 speak positively on this subject, since the injecting material used by Prof. Hyrtl 

 has never been disclosed. The advantage of using ether for injections, as first 

 directed by Dr. Goddard, instead of turpentine, is that preparations in which 

 ether has been used are always more uniformly and more minutely injected ; and 

 by dissolving solid substances in it, Dr. Da Costa believed that equal distinctness, 

 with perhaps greater minuteness than is even afforded in the preparations of 

 Prof. Hyrtl, may be obtained. 



June 1th* 

 Major Le Conte in the Chair. 



Dr. Le Conte presented two papers for publication in the Proceedings, 

 viz : " Synopsis of the Dermestidse of the United States, " and " Synop- 

 sis of the Byrrhidse of North America," both of which were referred 

 to Dr. Leidy, Dr. Elwyn, and Dr. Ruschenberger. 



Dr. Leidy presented a paper for publication in the Journal, entitled, 

 " Descriptions of New Fossil species from the cretaceous formation of 

 Sage Creek, Nebraska, by John Evans, M. D., and B. F . Shumard, 

 M. D. ;" which was referred to Mr. Conrad, Mr. Charles E. Smith, and 

 Mr. Foulke. 



Mr. Cassin presented a paper for publication in the Proceedings, en- 

 titled, " Descriptions of new Birds collected between Albuquerque, New 

 Mexico, and San Francisco, California. By S. F. Baird." Referred to 

 Mr. Cassin, Dr. Heermann, and Col. McCall.

Descriptions of new Reptiles from California. 

 By Edward Hallowell, M. D. 



CHELONIANS. 



Emys nigra, nob. 



Sp. Char. Shell oblong-ovate, slightly compressed at the sides and emargi- 

 nate, but not distinctly serrated posteriorly; latero-posterior margins of carapax 

 everted; nuchal plate narrow, truncate anteriorly, broader posteriorly ; 24 mar- 

 ginal plates, the two posterior more or less quadrilateral, the two adjoining pen- 

 tagonal ; color blackish above, the upper part of head and neck presenting 

 numerous very small yellow spots upon a black ground ; anterior extremities 

 with a tinge of yellow ; under jaw and throat yellow, with dark colored mark- 

 ings ; plastron yellow in the middle, with large blotches of black or dark brown 

 at the sides, and anteriorly and posteriorly ; under surface of tail and extremities 

 blackish; tail of moderate length. 




92 [June, 



Dimensions. Length of head 1 inch ; breadth f ; length of carapax 6 inches, 

 measured along curvature superiorly ; breadth at middle 5| inches ; of tail 2. 



Habitat. Posa Creek, Lower California, where it occurs in great numbers. 



Gen. obs. This species resembles none ol the North American Emydes with 

 which 1 am acquainted. Its dark color puts one in mind of, but is not so jet a 

 black as that of Sternothaerus niger of Madagascar. 



SAURIANS. 



Dipso-saurtjs, Hallowell. 



Gen. char. Head triangular, covered above and in front with tubercles ; nos- 

 trils latero-superior, opening in a single scale ; rostral plate veitical, triangular; 

 jaws margined each with a series of smooth quadrilateral plates ; tympanum 

 visible, depressed ; upper part of body covered with carinated scales, more or 

 less rounded posteriorly, arranged in oblique rows ; a row of scales much larger 

 than the rest along the dorsal line, and much more strongly carinated, forming 

 a slight dorsal crest; a gular fold ; scales of abdomen quadrangular, smooth ; 

 femoral pores ; tail covered with transverse rows of verticillate and carinated 

 scales* 



DlPSO-SAURUS DORSALIS. 



Sy?i. Crotaphytus dorsalis, Baird and Girard. Proceed. Acad. Nat. Sc. 1852, 

 p. 126. 



Coloration. Body presenting numerous lines of red upon the sides, with 

 blotches of the same color over the shoulders, the intervening spaces numerous 

 white spots; upper surface and sides of tail marked with red spots arranged in 

 transverse rows ; upper surface of extremities with red ; throat, abdomen, under 

 surface of extremities and tail white. The coloration, as described by Profs. 

 Baird and Girard, appears to be taken from younger specimens, one such before 

 me corresponding with it precisely. 



Dimensions. Length of head 7 lines; breadth 7 ; length of head, neck and 

 body to vent, 8 inches, (Fr.) ; of tail lh inch.; anterior extremities 1 inch. ; 

 posterior 3 inches to extremity of nail of longest toe. 



Habitat Desert of the Colorado, to which it appears to be confined. The 

 smaller specimen from near Fort Yuma, the large one found in the desert be- 

 tween Rum River and the Tejon Pass, (pronounced Tahon ;) a country without 

 water, not sandy, but arid, bearing artemisia, &c. 



Gen. remarks. This animal differs from Crotaphytus (Holbrook) in having 

 the upper part of the body covered with quadrangular scales, instead of granula- 

 tions, and the larger row of carinated dorsal scales giving rise to a slight crest, 

 no trace of which exists in Crotaphytus, from Leiolepis in having tubercles, and 

 not plates, upon the head and from Homalo-saurus in the form of the marginal 

 plates of the upper jaw. 



Uro-saurus, Hallowell, 



Gen. char. Body very slender, which, as well as the head, is much depressed; 

 scales upon the back much larger than those upon the sides, and strongly cari- 

 nated ; nostrils superior in a single scale; head covered with plates ; aural aper- 

 tures very distinct ; a gular fold ; extremities slender; toes 55 ; tail very long 

 and tapering, verticillate ; femoral pores, but no anal ones. 



Uro-saurus graciosus, nob. 



Sp. char. Head yellow, with a few brow r nish marks; seven longitudinal rows 

 of scales upon the back very distinctly carinated. Color of body yellowish, 

 mixed with brownish and black spots ; extremities yellowish, with dark colored 

 transverse bands ; tail of same color above as body ; under surface silvery white, 

 with blackish spots; eleven femoral pores. 



Dimensions. Length of head 5-8ths inch; greatest breadth f inch; length 

 of head, neck and body to vent, If inch j of anterior extremities to extremity of 




1854.] 93 



longest toe 6-8ths inch ; of posterior to extremity of longest toe Jf inch ; of tail 

 4 inches; total length. 



Habitat. Lower California. 



Gen. Remarks. The contrast between the large carinated scales upon the 

 back, and the small ones upon the sides resembling granulations, is very striking ; 

 the long and slender tail also is remarkable. In these respects Uro-saurus is 

 allied to Tachydromus, but the plates upon the head are very different. 



SCELOPORUS, Wiegmann.' 



ScELOPORUS MAGISTER, nob. 



Sp. char. Larger than any known species of Sceloporus, and remarkable for 

 its large and strongly carinated scales, which are very much denticulated poste- 

 riorly ; anterior margin of aural apertures strongly denticulated ; upper part of 

 head, body and extremities and tail straw color, without spots or blotches ; a 

 black triangular blotch upon each side of the neck, in front of the shoulder, the 

 base below ; two large bluish green blotches upon the abdomen, one on each side 

 and one upon the neck ; the rest of the under surface light straw color ; tail long, 

 very thick at base, tapering near the point ; twelve femoral pores on each side. 



Dimensions. Length of head, neck and body to vent, 4 6-8ths inches; great- 

 est breadth of head 1 inch; length of head If inch ; of tail l-5th inch ; of anterior 

 extremities l inch ; of anterior foot to extremity of longest toe 1 inch ; of pos- 

 terior extremities 1 6-8ths inch; of foot to extremity of longest toe If inch : 

 total length 9 6-8ths inches. 



Habitat. Near Fort Yuma, at junction of Colorado and Gila, also nearTuson 

 in Sonora, upon a rocky soil. 



Gen. remarks. This species is remarkable for its large size and greatly deve- 

 loped spines. It is a much larger animal than the spinosus of Wiegmann, and 

 wants the quadruple series of dark colored spots that exist in that animal. 

 The posterior margins of the scales are strongly denticulated, which is not the 

 case in spinosus, one of the characters of which is " squamis paucidentatis." 

 From horridus, Wieg. it differs in coloration, arrangement of plates upon the head, 

 and in the number of femoral pores, which in the latter are 4 5. 



Sceloporus bi-seriatus, nob. 



Sp. char. Scales of the back much larger than those upon the sides. Five 

 frontal plates in two rows ; the middle of the anterior row largest ; four inter- 

 nasals ; two very small plates between the anterior row and rostral ; two vertical 

 plates ; one large plate on each side of the occipital, and two in front of them; 

 posterior border of scales not denticulated. A narrow brownish vitta across the 

 head near the middle of the superciliary plates ; coloration of head resembling 

 that of undulatus ; light ash grey above, with a double row of dark-colored spots 

 upon the back on each side of the dorsal line, extending a short distance upon 

 the tail ; extremities ash colored above, banded with black ; under surface 

 silvery grey, with two blue blotches, one on each side of the abdomen, and a 

 blue blotch upon the chin ; 20 femoral pores. 



Dimensions. Length of head, neck and body to vent, 3 inches: of tail 4 

 inches ; length of anterior extremities 5-8ths inch ; of foot anteriorly to extremity 

 of longest toe 5-8ths inch ; of posterior extremity 1 inch ; of foot posteriorly to 

 extremity of longest toe 1 inch ; total length 7 inches. 



Habitat. Borders of El Paso Creek and in Tejon Valley. Constantly climb- 

 ing up trees, when scared, to a distance of twenty or thirty feet, running along 

 the ground and up the trees very quickly. 



Gen. remarks. Wants the undulating lines or bars of undulatus, these being 

 replaced by the spots above described; the scales upon the sides are also 

 much smaller than those of undulatus. This species resembles very closely 

 the variabilis of Wiegmann, and is probably the same, notwithstanding cer- 

 tain differences in the description. In the absence of a good drawing, or authen- 

 ticated specimen, we cannot pronounce, positively, whether they be the same 

 or not, although inclined to the former opinion. Thus the head, according to 




94 [June, 



Wiegmann, is unicolor ; and the plates upon the head cannot be said to 

 he ruguloso carinatis, for they are for the most part smooth in bi-seriatus. 

 It wants the white lateral line beneath the spots which is observed in scalaris, 

 Wiegmann. The arrangement of the plates upon the head appears to characterize 

 this species very well, being uniform, with unimportant exceptions, in all the 

 specimens brought by Dr. Heermann. 



Var. A. azureus. Body uniformly blue above, mingled with brown, the 

 the blue color predominating; on the sides greenish with a metallic lustre ; head 

 brownish above ; two large blue blotches upon abdomen, one on each side ; rest 

 of under surface silvery white with bluish tints, especially about the chin ; scales 

 large and strongly carinated, not denticulated posteriorly; tail stout at the base, 

 much less tapering than in bi-seriatus; the plates of the head correspond pre- 

 cisely with those of the latter animal. 



Dimensions* Length of head, neck and body to vent, 3 2-8ths inches ; of tail 

 3 5-Sths inches ; of anterior extremities 1 inch ; of anterior foot to extremity of 

 longest toe 6-8ths inch ; of posterior foot to extremity of longest toe 1 2-8ths 

 inch ; total length 6| inches. 



Habitat. Associated with bi-seriatus. 



Var. B. variegatus. Body light ash color, with transverse brownish bands 

 and markings coalescing with each other, so as to give the whole a marbled 

 appearance ; head above ash color mingled with brown ; extremities ash color, 

 with transverse bands of brown ; under surface silvery grey without bluish spots 

 or blotches ; 17 femoral pores, remarkably large ; tail stout, thick at the base. 



Dimensions. Length of head neck and body 4h inches ; greatest breadth of 

 head 1 inch ; length 1 inch ; tail mutilated, circumference at base 1 2-8ths inch ; 

 length of anterior extremities If inch ; of loot to extremity of longest toe f inch ; 

 of posterior extremity 2 inches ; of foot, posteriorly, to extremity of longest toe 

 1 inch. 



Habitat. Same. 



CNEMIDOPHORUS, Dum. and Bib. 



Gen. Char. Nostrils in the nasal plate near its posterior border ; two supero- 

 nasals ; palate without teeth, with a shallow, triangular notch, posteriorly ; 

 scales smooth. (Dum. and Bibron.) 



Cnemidophorus undtjlatus,* nob. 



Sp. char. Body of moderate size ; tail very long ; head brownish above ; upper 

 part of body with three or four longitudinal bands of black with irregular mar- 

 gins ; interspaces yellowish, with a tinge of red in some specimens ; sides mar- 

 gined with black and white or light yellow ; tail black and light yellow, present- 

 ing numerous transverse rows of rhomboidal carinated scales ; upper part of 

 extremities same color as sides of body; under surface silvery grey, with a 

 number of minute black spots upon the abdomen, throat and chin ; tail round, 

 moderately thick at base, tapering to a point ; 20 pores very distinct ; 8 rows 

 scales upon the abdomen. 



Dimensions. Length of head 1 inch ; greatest breadth posteriorly half an inch ; 

 of head, neck and body 3k inches ; of anterior extremities % inch ; of foot to ex- 

 tremity of longest toe half an inch; of posterior extremities 1 inch ; of foot to 

 extremity of longest toe 1 inch ; of tail 7 inches ; total length 111 inches. 



Habitat. Near Fort Yuma, in San Joachim Valley. 



Gen. observ. Cnemidophorus perplexus, according to Profs. Baird and Girard, 

 has seven longitudinal yellowish lines along the back ; in all the specimens above 

 described, five in number, there are but four. Profs. Baird and Girard state that 

 in some specimens of Cnemidophorus tigris, " four longitudinal yellow stripes 

 may be seen extending from the occiput to the base of the tail, and occasionally 

 a little distance on the latter. In the young state the black patches predominate, 

 unite, and form as it were the ground color, and the yellow constitutes irregular 

 small spots." Vide Sta?isbury's Report, Appendix C. p. 339. 



From the undulating longitudinal dark lines along the back. 




1854.] 95 



The total length of Say's Ameiva tesselata is 1 foot, tail 8J inches, in 

 this respect corresponding very well with the above, but none of the specimens 

 present the tesselated appearance described by Say, the ' transverse lines 

 dividing the whole surface in a tesselated manner." 



Eumeces, Wiegmann, 



Sp. char. Two supero-nasals contiguous ; internasal much more extended in 

 the lateral than antero-posterior direction, its internal margins in contact with 

 the anterior frenal ; two fronto-nasal, contiguous, lateral border in contact with 

 the posterior frenal ; frontal hexagonal, elongated, broader anteriorly ; fronto- 

 parietal rhomboidal, placed obliquely ; inter-parietal broad, with an acute angle 

 in front, passing in between the fronto-parietals ; parietals oblong, quadrilateral ; 

 four supra-orbitals ; a small naso-frenal : an anterior and posterior frenal, the 

 latter much larger ; twelve rows of smooth hexagonal scales upon the back, be- 

 ginning with those marked by the lateral vitta. 



Color. Shining black or brown above, with four bluish vittae, the two in- 

 ternal broader than the others, commencing about midway upon the sides of the 

 head immediately over the eyes, and extending along the back and terminating 

 upon the tail ; the lateral ones commence at the anterior margin of the orbit, 

 and passing beneath it, extend upon the sides and are lost upon the tail ; chin 

 and throat whitish ; abdomen and under part of tail slate color ; under surface of 

 extremities whitish. 



Dimensions. Length of head f inch ; breadth \ inch ; length of body and tail 

 4? inches; of tail 2 3-8ths inches; of anterior extremities inch; of posterior 

 | inch. 



Habitat. Lower California, near Mohave River, and in San Bernardino Valley. 



OPHIDIANS. 



Rhinostoma occipitale, nob. 



Char. Teeth of equal length, posterior ones not channelled ; head depressed, 

 eyes small ; a rostral, two anterior and two posterior frontals; one anterior and 

 two posterior oculars; a vertical ; two occipitals ; a small frenal ; nostrils in a 

 single plate ; seven superior labials, the eye resting on the third and fourth. 

 Abdom. scuta, 158 ; subcaud. 34. 



Coloration. Milk white above with 41 transverse black bands, including 

 seven upon tail and one upon posterior part of head ; six complete rings upon 

 tail ; throat and abdomen white ; under part of tail white, with transverse bands 

 continuous with those upon back of tail ; 15 rows of smooth quadrangular scales. 



Dimensions Length of head 4 lines, breadth 2 lines; of body 9 inches 9 

 lines; of tail, 1 inch 7 lines; total length, 9 inches. 



Hab. Mohave Desert. 



Gen. Remarks, This serpent resembles no other as yet figured in N. Ame- 

 rica, and is therefore easily recognized. In the genus Sonora of Prof. Baird and 

 Girard, there are, according to them, three postoculars, and two nasal plates on 

 each side with the nostril between them. In Sonora semiannulata there are 

 twenty-five transverse black bands upon the body, and six complete rings upon 

 the tail. The rings in Col. (Zacholus) zonatus of Blainville completely sur- 

 round the body. The nostrils, according to Blainville, open between two plates, 

 but Wagler has them each in a single plate, " in medio scutelli sitis," in his defi- 

 nition of Zacholus. Wagler, however, cites Col. Riccioli, Metaxa Serp. Rom. 

 as appearing to belong to this genus, " scheint als gattung zu gehoren," but C. 

 Bonaparte represents the nostrils as placed in the commissure between two scuta 

 M gli narici sono situate alia eommissura di duo scutelli nasali." Blainville 

 represents two black half rings upon the head. Zacholus zonatus is probably 

 allied to Coronella balteata. 



Crotalus cerastes, nob. 

 Sp. Char. Head covered with polygonal tubercles, larger in front, the latter 

 in three rows; two small quadrangular plates on each side, between the nostril 

 and the vertical rostral ; two quadrangular internasals ; external border of supra- 




96 [June, 



ciliary plates developed, so as to present two horn-like processes, one on each 

 side of the head at their middle; nostrils small; pits between the eyes and nos- 

 trils large ; twenty rows of carinated scales, the inferior rows near the abdomen 

 smooth; body slender, much compressed; tail very short, with three or four 

 rattles. 



Coloration. Head ash color above, a black band running from the posterior 

 margin of the orbit to within a line of the occiput ; a series of forty-one transverse 

 brownish bands, yellow in the centre, along the back; general color of animal 

 above light yellow; several transverse bands upon the tail ; under surface light 

 yellow, slightly clouded with spots near the external margin of the abdomen; 

 abdom. scut. 146 ; two rows of bifid post-abdom. scutell. ; 14 single caudal scuta ; 

 three inferior rows bifid. 



Dimensions. Length of head 5 lines; greatest breadth 4 lines; length of body 

 8 and 3-8th inches; of tail, | ; total length 9| inches. 



Hab Borders of the Mohave river, and in the desert of the Mohave, always 

 in the dry sandy soil, with no vegetation whatever. Maximum size one foot 

 and a half; occurs in large numbers, and is also seen in the Desert of the Colo- 

 rado, but is much less abundant, Dr. Heermann not having observed it ihere. 

 The river Mohave spreads itself out in the desert and there loses itself, and upon 

 the floating sand hills near it these animals are found. The Crolalus Lecontii 

 is never seen with them. The Mohave empties into a salt lake about 15 miles 

 in extent. 



Gen. Remarks. I supposed that this animal might be the young of Crotalus 

 Lecontii, but Dr. Heermann informs me that the Lecontii is never found with 

 it, and that it never attains to more than a foot and a half in length, and always 

 presents the horn-like processes above described. It would appear to be the 

 representative of the Vipera Cerastes of Africa, and is found, like that serpent, 

 in desert and sandy regions, and is also slow and sluggish in its movements. 

 The genus Cerastes, proposed by Wagler and adopted by Dumeril and Bibron, it 

 would appear should be dropped and Vipera substituted. 



BATRACHIANS. 



Rana nigricans, nob. 



Sp, char. Remarkable for its size ; color uniform, dark brown, with numerous 

 small black spots, and large blotches interspersed over the surface ; sides some- 

 what lighter, marked with black; anterior extremities dark brown, or ash color 

 above, blotched with black ; posterior of same color, with numerous transverse 

 black bands; chin, throat and abdomen straw color, shaded with brown; under 

 surface of extremities yellowish, marked with black. 



Dimensions. Length of head, neck and body, 4 inches; greatest breadth of 

 head, If inches; length of anterior extremities, 1| inches: of foot anteriorly to 

 extremity of longest toe, 1 inch; of posterior extremity, 5 inches; length of hind 

 foot, If inches ; of foot posteriorly to distal end of longest toe, 2| inches. 



Hab. El Paso Creek. 



Gen. Observations. This species is remarkable for the great length of its 

 posterior extremities; allied to Rana Draytoni, Baird and Girard, but the 

 posterior extremities appear to be longer. 



Hyla nebulosa, nob. 



Sp. char. Uniform light grey upon the upper part of the body and sides ; 

 snout light ash ; a considerable number of dark colored subcircular spots about 

 a line in diameter, scattered over the upper part of the body and upon the sides ; 

 extremities ash color above, with greyish spots; abdomen greenish yellow; chin 

 light yellow; under surface of extremities orange colored; abdomen and under 

 surface of extremities granulated. 



Dimensions. Length of head, neck and body, If inches; greatest breadth of 

 head, | inch; length of anterior extremities, If inches; of posterior extremities 

 2 and 3-8th inches to extremity of longest toe. 



Hab. Tejon Pass. 




1854.] 97 



Gen. Remarks. Is a much smaller animal than Hyla versicolor, and the mark- 

 ings are very different. The back is much less abundantly covered with warts, 

 and the superciliary ridges which are so much developed in versicolor, are but 

 slightly so in this species. The extremities are much more slender in the latter, 

 and the tibia is of nearly equal length with the thigh, but in versicolor it is 

 about a line shorter. 



Hyla scapularis, nob. 



Var. hypochondriaca. 



Char.Oi a uniform pale olive, color above without spots, paler toward the 

 sides; numerous small, elevated smooth points upon the surface, resembling 

 tubercles; upper surface of extremities pale olive; a narrow dark colored vitta, 

 extending from the anterior margin of the eye to the snout; another much 

 broader from the posterior margin of the eye to the shoulder ; margin of upper 

 jaw of same color as the vitta ; posterior part of abdomen and under surface of 

 extremities orange colored ; chin and throat whitish ; abdomen thickly granulated. 



Dimensions. Length of head and body, \h inches; of head f ; breadth f ; 

 length of anterior extremities, f ; of posterior, If. 



Hab Tejon Pass. 



Gen. Remarks. It will be observed that it wants the squalus toothed mark 

 upon the head, and the markings upon the back, which belong to scapularis. 



The specimens above described, with numerous others already known, and a 

 large number of rare fishes, birds and plants, and many insects, were collected 

 by Dr. Heermann, Naturalist to the Government Expedition for the exploration 

 of a route for the Pacific Railroad, and afford the best evidence of the zeal and 

 untiring industry of our esteemed fellow member. Through his efforts in great 

 part the Herpetology of California is now almost, if not quite, as well known as 

 that of Pennsylvania. 



On a genus and species of Serpent from Honduras, presttmed to be new. 



By Edward Hallo well, M. D. 



MICROPHIS. 



Char. Head of moderate size, short, depressed in the middle, covered 

 with nine plates ; snout rounded ; nostrils between the nasal and anterior frontal 

 plates ; a frenal; one antocular ; two posterior oculars ; seven superior labials, 

 the eye resting on the third and fourth; eyes of moderate size, pupil round; 

 supraciliary plate not projecting over the eye ; tail of moderate length. 



Microphis quinqueliniatus, nob. 



Sp. char. Head, body and tail above ash color ; five dark blue stripes ex- 

 tending from the occiput to the base of the tail, the three intermediate ones 

 broader than the lateral; the other stripes prolonged upon the tail, the middle 

 one to near its extremity ; 17 rows of smooth quadrangular scales ; 170 abdom. 

 scuta; two bifid preabdom.; 33 subcaudal. 



Dimensions. Length of head 6-8ths inch; breadth posteriorly 4-8ths inch ; 

 length of body 17 inches ; of tail 2 inches 5-8ths ; circumference 1 inch 3-8ths ; 

 total length 1 foot 8 inch 3-8ths. 



Habitat. Honduras, South America. Two specimens presented to Museum 

 of the Academy, by Dr. Woodhouse. 



Gen. Remarks. This serpent has the general characters of Coronella,but the 

 nostrils open between the anterior frontal and nasal plates, insiead of the nasal 

 and internasal, the two being fused into one plate. We have, therefore, pro- 

 posed for it the generic name given above, although not disposed to attach much 

 importance to minor considerations of this kind in the determination of genera.

Remarks on the Geographical distribution of Reptiles, with descriptions of 

 several species supposed to benew y and corrections of former papers* 



By Edward Hallowell, M. D. 



Genus Euprepis. 



Gen. character. Nostrils in the posterior part of the nasal plate ; two super- 

 nasals ; palate with a triangular furrow, more or less profound ; scales carinated; 

 pterygoid teeth. (Dum. and Bib.) 



Euprepis striata, nob . 



Sp. character. Nasal plates well developed, two super-nasal contiguous ; an 

 internasal ; two fronto-nasal wide apart ; a frontal broad in front, narrow poste- 

 riorly ; two fronto-parietal, more or less quadrilateral, contiguous ; an inter-pa- 

 rietal very narrow posteriorly, broad with an acute angle in front; two parietals, 

 no occipital ; two freno-nasal, and two freno-orbital plates ; head brownish above 

 in front, and upon the sides, blackish posteriorly ; ground color of body and tail 

 above deep black, the middle of each scale dusky white, the back and tail pre- 

 senting therefore numerous alternating lines and bands of black and white ; 

 upper surface of extremities blackish with white spots ; sides of body marked 

 with black and dusky white and brown ; chin, throat, abdomen, under surface of 

 extremities and tail silvery white j 21 rows of strongly carinated scales ; the 

 greater number of these scales present each five carinas upon the surface.

 body 3f inches ; of tail 4i inches ; of anterior extremities 1 inch 4 lines ; of pos- 

 terior 1 inch 6 lines ; total length 9 inches 4 lines. 



Habitat. Liberia, western coast of Africa. Two specimens in museum, pre- 

 sented by Dr. Henry A. Ford. There is in the Academy another specimen of 

 this genus from the same locality, described by me some years ago as Plestiodon 

 Harlani. It is a much larger animal and it differs from the present species 

 greatly in its coloring, being uniformly yellowish brown above with distinct 

 bars of dark blown upon the sides. The scales in Harlani are tricarinate. I 

 have not been able to discover pterygoid teeth in either of these animals. 



Pachydactylus tristis, nob. 



Sp. character. Color above yellowish, with numerous brownish lines upon 

 the upper surface of the tail ; throat, abdomen, under surface of extremities and 

 tail yellowish; body and extremities covered above with granulations; abdomen 

 with smooth scales ; granulations upon under surface of the tail larger for the 

 most part than those upon upper ; nostril plate quadrangular, two small plates 

 immediately above it ; head covered with small granulations. 



Dimensions. Length of head 11 lines ; of body to vent 2 inches 5 lines; from 

 vent to extremity of tail 2 inches 4 lines ; total length 5 inches 6 lines. 



Habitat. Liberia, west coast of Africa. Specimen in museum presented by 

 Dr. Goheen.

Gen. character. Head sub-distinct, ovate, quadrangular ; rostrum narrow, 

 acute, furrowed in front of the eyes, supra-orbitar plates projecting considerably; 

 eyes oblong, rotund; pupil round ; vertical scute long, narrow; scales not densely 

 approximated, lanceolate, concave ; abdomen and under part of tail rounded ; 

 two posterior oculars, one anterior, one loral, quadrate. (Europe and Africa.) 



CCELOPELTIS VIRGATA, nob . 



Sp. character. Color uniform, brown above, reddish upon the sides, and to a 

 certain extent upon the abdominal scuta ; middle portion of abdominal scuta 

 straw color; two narrow yellowish vittae upon each side of the head, the supe- 

 rior passing immediately over the eye ; scales smooth, 23 rows ; entire length 

 1 foot 8 inches, (Fr.) length of tail 3 inches; abdom. scuta 192, subcaudal 55. 



Habitat. Liberia, west coast of Africa. Two specimens in museum of 

 Academy, presented by Dr. Ford.

Fam. VIPERIDtE. 



Gen. Brachycranion, Hallowell. 



Gen. char. Head short and thick, covered with seven plates, exclusive of the 

 rostral, viz., one pair of frontal, a vertical, two supra-orbitar, and two occipitals, 

 one ant-orbitar and one post-orbitar ; margin of orbit formed by supra-ocular, pos- 

 terior and anterior oculars, and superior margin of fourth labial plate. Subcaudal 

 plates single; palatal, but, with the exception of the fangs, no mandibular teeth. 



Brachycranion corpulentum. 



Sp. char. Occipitals subquadrangular ; four supero-labials ; one large tempo- 

 ral plate immediately behind post-ocular ; scales smooth, quadrangular, 25 rows; 

 color shining black above, brownish beneath ; 182 abdominal scuta ; 25 sub- 

 caudal. 



Dimensions. Length of head i an inch, breadth 5 lines ; length of body 1 foot 

 6 inches ; of tail 2 inches ; circumference 1 inch 8 lines. 



Habitat. Liberia, W. coast of Africa. Presented by Dr. Ford to the Academy. 



Gen. observ. The vipers among venomous serpents are characterized chiefly 

 by the absence of forsettes behind the nostrils, and the presence of a double row 

 of plates under the tail. In the greater number, the head is covered with scales 

 as upon the body ; in others there are also plates of various forms, and irregularly 

 disposed, as in Vipera berus, while others have upon the head smooth and regu- 

 larly formed plates, like those of Coluber and the genus Sepedon of Merrem. In 

 others the subcaudal plates are bifid toward the anus, and single near the ex- 

 tremity of the tail, or alternately single and bifid as in Acanthophis. 



Bungarus, a genus of Colubriform venomous serpents inhabiting Asia, has a 

 dorsal row of hexagonal scales larger than the others, with nine plates upon the 

 head and single plates under the tail. Elaps has nine plates upon the head, but 

 the plates under the tail are bifid. In the animal under consideration there are, 

 as above stated, but seven plates upon the head exclusive of the rostral, there 

 being but one pair of frontals (two in Elaps, Acanthophis and Bungarus) and 

 single plates under the tail. These characteristics, with the peculiar form of 

 the head and the presence of fangs, are such as to give it a distinct generic cha- 

 racter different from those of any of the serpents with which I am acquainted. 

 The appearance of Brachycranion corpulentum is very repulsive. Since the 

 above was written, I have observed in the work of Dr. Andrew Smith,* on the 

 Zoology of South Africa, the description and figure of a reptile which resembles 

 the one just described, to which the name Atractaspis Bibronii has been given. 

 The body in Atractaspis Bibronii is much more slender, is longer, but the tail 

 is shorter. The shape of the head in the figure is very different, giving one the 

 impression of a harmless serpent, as Dr. Smith at first supposed it to be, that of 

 the other induces at once a strong suspicion of its venomous character. There 

 are but twenty rows of scales in Bibronii, and the general color of the body and 

 tail is intermediate between blackish green and orange colored brown. The 

 fangs in Corpulentum also differ from those of Bibronii in their dimensions, 

 being not more than half the length of those in the figure of Bibronii. Like them, 

 they do not appear to be capable of complete erection. Upon the upper surface 

 of the tail in Corpulentum, along the median line near its middle, is a row of six 

 broad scales and four others near the tail, somewhat similar in appearance to 

 those upon the back in Dipsas. 



Cham.eleo gracilis, Hallowell, Journal Acad. Nat. Sc. vol. viii. pi. 18. A 

 good species. It differs considerably in its general appearance from Chama?leo 

 dilepis of Leach, of which there are three specimens in the collection presented 

 by Dr. Henry A. Ford, of Liberia. One of these on being opened was found to 

 contain more than a dozen eggs. I thought at one time that possibly Ch. gra- 

 cilis might be the female of Ch. dilepis.

Euprepis Harlani, nob. 



Syn. Plestiodon Harlani, Proceed. Acad. Nat. Sc, vol. ii. p. 170. 



Boa Liberiensis, nob. Abdom. scut. 237, subcaud. plates single, 53 50 ; Ion

 Syn. Python Liberiensis, Proceed. Acad. Nat. Sc. vol. ii. p. 249. 



Dipsas Blandingii, Hall., Proceed. Acad. Nat. Sc, vol. ii. p. 170. 



Anterior teeth of lower jaw much larger than the others. Two teeth, one on 

 each side in posterior part of upper maxilla provided, each with a sheath, and 

 channelled anteriorly ; four rows of teeth in the upper jaw, two in the lower. 

 Seventeen rows of scales. Two anterior oculars, two posterior ; a loral ; nostrils 

 between two plates, occipital large. Abdom. scuta 273. Subcaud. 131. Length 

 of head, 1 inch 5 lines ; of head and body 4 feet ; of tail 1 foot (Fr.) 2h inches. 

 Schlegel remarks that the mode of dentition in Dipsas cynodon is unique in the 

 genus, having one or more teeth much longer'than the rest at the posterior part 

 of the upper maxilla, others equally longer being found at the anterior extremity 

 of the inferior maxilla and of the palatal bone. It will be observed that a simi- 

 lar arrangement exists in Dipsas Blandingii, although the animals differ greatly 

 from each other. Triglophodon ? Dumeril. Prodromus, class, des Ophid. 



Psammophis Phillipsii, nob. 



Syn. Coluber Phillipsii, Proceed. Acad. Nat. Sc, vol. ii. p. 169. 



A very well characterized species of Psammophis. Jaws very dilatable, 

 several teeth in the anterior part of the lower jaw longer than the others ; in the 

 upper maxilla on each side two long teeth posteriorly, and two near the middle; 

 teeth unequal ; four first followed apparently by an interval, then the two ante- 

 rior long ones ; scales lanceolate, smooth, intermediate ones more narrow. 



Psammophis Phillipsii differs greatly from Psammophis moniliger of the Cape. 

 The two longitudinal rows of black spots are wanting in Phillipsii, and the 

 latter is a much larger animal ; 15 rows of scales. 



CORONELLA TRIANGULARIS, nob. 



Syn. Col. leevis, Proceed. Acad. Nat. Sc, vol. ii. p. 118. 



17 rows of smooth scales, 21 in Coronella laevis. This animal has a general 

 resemblance to the Coronella laevis, (pi. 12, Amphibia, Fauna Pontica) but the 

 markings are very different, as is also the number of rows of scales. The tail 

 is also longer. It may be considered as the representative of the Coronella laevis 

 in Western Africa. 



Leptophis smaragdina, Boie. 



Sy?i. Dendrophis smaragdina, Schlegel. Leptophis gracilis, Hall. Proc 

 Acad. Nat. Sci., Vol. ii, p. 60. Fifteen rows of strongly carinated scales; an- 

 terior frontals rather longer than the posterior ; nostrils between two plates; 

 one long and narrow loral on each side; one ant-orbitar, two posterior orbitars; 

 eight superior labials on the right side, nine on the left ; inferior margin of 

 orbit formed by the 4th and 5th on the right, and by the 5th and 6th on the 

 left side of the head ; posterior teeth not channelled. Since the above was 

 read, we have received Vol. vii. part 1, of the Herpetologie generale, ou histoire 

 naturelle complete des reptiles, par M. Dumeril, in which I observe that this 

 animal has been placed in the genus Leptophis by that eminent herpetologist. 

 This genus, as characterized by him, includes serpents with scales, sometimes 

 carinated and sometimes smooth, a conclusion which we ourselves had also 

 arrived at the carination of the scales was added by Wagler. Proc Acad. 

 Nat. Sci., Dec, 1852, p. 203.

the others, and channelled anteriorly; 13 rows of scales, four upon the back 

 carinated, the marginal row near The abdomen larger than the others. Of this 

 species there are five specimens in the, collection of the Academy, three 

 from Dr. Savage, and two fully grown from Dr. Ford. These specimens illus- 

 trate very well the inconstancy of certain plates about the head in serpents. 

 In one the loral plates are entirely absent, the posterior frontal passing down to 

 join the superior labial plates ; in a second of the smaller specimens there are two 

 lorals on each side ; in a third there are two on one side (the left) and one on 

 the other ; in one of the larger specimens there are two on each side, and in the 

 other, two on the left and one on the right.* Wagler, in his definition of the 

 characters of the genus Dryophis states that there is no loral plate, the posterior 

 frontals passing down along the side of the head, and coming in contact with 

 tbe superior labials.

The genus Distichurus was based, very improperly, upon a single specimen ; 

 and the characters in that were not of sufficient importance to establish a genus. 

 The plates toward the extremity of the tail are not constantly single. In 

 one out of four specimens which we have, they are bifid. In Crotalus the plates 

 toward the extremity of the tail are sometimes bifid, and in Trigmocephalus 

 also. 



BUFO MACULATUS, nob. 



Syn. Bufo cinereus. Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci., Vol. ii., p. 169. The name 

 cinereus has long been applied by Schneider, Daudin, Merrem and others to the 

 Bufo vulgaris of Europe. Bufo maculatus resembles somewhat Bufo pan- 

 therinus, but differs from it, according to the description of Dumeril and Bibron, 

 in the size of its tympanum, the breadth of which is considerably larger than 

 the length of the upper eyelid. The form and arrangement of the markings 

 differ greatly from those in the plate of Ruppel. 



The Herpetology of Africa has as yet been but too imperfectly studied to 

 enable us to comprehend the geographical distribution of the reptiles of this vast 

 continent. The labors of Dr. Smith have left but little to be desired for the 

 illustration of the southern part of it, and Ruppell has given good dpscriptions 

 and drawings of a number of reptiles in N. Africa and Abyssinia. These, with 

 the great work on E<*ypt, and the late production of M. Bianconi, on the Natural 

 History of Madagascar, constitute the most reliable sources of information 

 appertaining to this subject. Let us hope that our own government will do for 

 the natural history of Western Africa what the English government has done 

 for that of the Southern portion of this great continent. 



The reptiles common to both Northern and Western Africa, so far as we 

 know, are Agama colonorum, Chamasleo dilepis (bilobus) Kinixis belliana 

 Echidna arietans, Naja haj.,var. black, Vipera (cerastes) nasicornis, the genera 



This inconstancy is observed in other genera. In Hydrus pelamoides the 

 frenal shield observed by M. Schlegel was not present in four individuals, ex- 

 amined in the Straits of Malacca : in all Hydri the shields of the head are liable 

 to considerable individual varieties of form (Cantor)* "Hydrus bicolor 

 Schneider a frenal shield has been observed in some individuals, but it was 

 absent in that examined in the Straits of Malacca, nor does it exist in the speci- 

 mens in the Museum of the Asiatic Society." p. 135. "In Dryinus prasinus, 

 Reinwardt, there are two, sometimes three frenals on each side." p. 83.

Pachydactylus, and Onychocephalus, and Causus rhombeatus. The genera Uro- 

 mastyx and Stellio are found in Northern, but do not appear to exist in S. Africa. 

 The study of the geographical distribution of animals, and especially of reptiles, 

 presents many very remarkable facts. Some species appear to have a very 

 wide distribution, others a very local. The Cistudo Carolina, for example, is 

 found in almost every part of the United States, but Emys Muhlenbergii and 

 Testudo polyphemus have a very limited range, the one being known only in a 

 small portion of the Northern States and the other of the Southern. The spe- 

 cies of reptiles of the United States are entirely different from those of Europe, 

 but there are a number of genera common to both ; among these are Testudo, 

 -Emys, Coronella, Tropidonotus, Psammophis, Coluber, Rana, Bufo, Salamandra. 



The genera Crotalus, Trigonocephaly or Elaps, all of which exist in the United 

 States, are not found in Europe, but the venomous serpents are replaced by the 

 viper, of which there are several species none of which are found with us, the 

 serpent called viper in the U. States being a Heterodon, a very harmless animal. 

 The viper is common in England but does not exist in Ireland, neither does 

 the genus Bufo. Some genera are very limited in their distribution, being found 

 in certain localities and nowhere else. Thus Amphiuma and Siren are found 

 in the Southern States; Menopoma, in the West and South; Menobranchus, in 

 the Western waters of the United States; Phrynosoma in New Mexico and 

 Texas ; Anota, of which but two specimens have yet been discovered, and 

 Homalosaurus in the Desert of the Colorado; Holbrookia or Cophosaurus in Texas; 

 Platysaurus, in Southern Africa ; Hypochthoon in lllyria. 



The species on the East and West Coast of South America differ almost en- 

 tirely from each other. The genus Proctotretus, comprising numerous species, 

 is found only in Peru. Other genera have a much wider distribution, but are con- 

 fined to certain large portions of the globe. Thus the Boas exist for the most 

 part in South America, the Pythons in Africa. According to Schlegel, no spe- 

 cies of serpent is found in all parts of the world, the Tortrix not an exception, 

 not being known in the United States. Gerrhosaurus is found in California, there 

 being but one species known in that State, but there are six species of the same 

 genus in Mexico, and six others, all described by Dr. Smith, exist at the Cape 

 of Good Hope. 



My friend, Professor Baird, informs me that he has recently received, from 

 the We ? tern portion of the United States, a specimen of Dipsas, a genus of ser- 

 pents not hitherto known to inhabit the United States. The genera Chamaeleo, 

 Euprepis, Eremias, Cordylus, Gecko, Hemydactylus, Ptyodactylus, Stenodac- 

 tylus, Phyllodactylus, Acanthodactylus, Zonurns, Varanus, are entirely unknown 

 in the United States, nor are there any true Lacertae. Among fresh water tor- 

 toises, the Emydes of the United States are very numerous, Prof. Holbrook having 

 figured as many as seventeen species ; they occur., also, in great numbers in In- 

 dia, twelve species having been described by Dumeril and Bibron, in their great 

 work on Reptiles. It is very remarkable, however, that but one species of 

 Emys, the Emys spengleri, of which we have the shell only in the Academy, 

 has been described as existing in the whole continent of Africa, whereas the 

 tortoises in the Southern portion of that country are numerous. Two species 

 of Sternothaerus are described as belonging to the island of Madagascar, the 

 niger and nigricans. We have the shell of one from Western Africa, which 

 probably belongs to the latter species. Among serpents the genus Tropidonotus 

 has a very wide range, being found more or less abundantly in almost every part 

 of the globe except Africa and Australia. The genus Trigonocephalus is not found 

 in Africa, but the vipers in that quarter of the globe are numerous, no less than 

 six species being described by Dr. Smith as inhabiting S. Africa, viz.: Echidna 

 arietans, atropos, atropoides, inornata, and Cerastes cornulus and ocellatus. To 

 these may be added the Vipera nasicofnis, or Natter Jack, which is found both 

 in Southern and Western Africa. Among the most remarkable of serpents are 

 those comprised in the genus Hydrophis. They are sea serpents, and <k inhabit 

 exclusively the inter-tropical latitudes of the Indian seas and of the great Pa- 

 cific Ocean." 



It has been a matter of doubt whether these animals are poisonous or not; but 




1854.] 103 



Dr. Cantor, in a paper published in the Zoological Transactions of London, 

 asserts positively that they are, and recent observations made by Dr. Burnet 

 of Boston, have confirmed his statements. The tree snakes are not found in 

 Europe, neither are the Calamars, nor Lycodons and Heterodons. The Bungari 

 inhabit Ceylon, India, Bengal and Java. The Basilisk is found in Celebes, Am- 

 boina and the Phillipine Isles; Dilophyrus in India and the Malayan Peninsula.* 

 No species of Coronella is said to exist in New Holland (Schlegel.) Eryx is 

 found only in the East. 



" Only one species of mammal is indigenous to the Gallapagos Islands, viz,, a 

 large and peculiar kind of mouse; but the number of lizards, tortoises and 

 snakes is so great that it may be called a land of reptiles. The variety indeed 

 of species is small, but the individuals of each are in great abundance. There 

 is a turtle, a large tortoise, (Testudo indicus,) four lizards, and about the same 

 number of snakes, but no frogs or toads. Belonging to the family Iguanidae, Bell, 

 are two species of Amblyrhynchus, one terrestrial, the -other marine ; the marine 

 species is extremely common on all the islands throughout the Archipelago. It 

 lives exclusively on the rocky sea beaches, and is never seen even ten yards 

 inland. The usual length is about a yard, but there are some even four feet long. 

 It is of a dirty black color, sluggish in its movements on the land, but when in 

 the water it swims with perfect ease and quickness by a serpentine movement 

 of its body and flattened tail, the legs during this time being motionless and 

 collapsed on its sides. Its limbs and strong claws are admirably adapted for 

 climbing over the rugged and fissured masses of lava which everywhere form 

 the coast. In such situations a group of six or seven of these hideous reptiles 

 may oftentimes be seen on the black rocks, a few feet above the sea, basking in 

 the sun with outstretched legs. Their stomachs, on being opened, are found 

 to be largely distended with minced seaweed, of a kind which grows at the 

 bottom of the sea, at some little distance from the coast. To obtain this the 

 lizards go out to sea in shoals. One of these animals was sunk in salt water 

 from the ship, with a heavy weight attached to it, and on being drawn up again, 

 after an hour, it was quite active and unharmed. It is not known by the inhabi- 

 tants where this animai lays its eggs ; a singular fact, considering its abundance, 

 and that the natives are well acquainted with the eggs of the terrestrial Amllyr- 

 hynehusf which is also herbivorous.' 5 Lyell's Geology, p. 280; Darwin's 

 Journal, ch. xix. The Amblyrhynchus inhabits also S. America. 



In the Island of Cuba are found the following genera: Emys (decussata and 

 rugosa, Shaw) Crocodilus (rhombifer and acutus,) Holotropis, Cyclura, Anolis, 

 Acanthophis, Chamaeleolis, Hemydactylus, Sphaeriodactylus, Gymnodactylus, 

 Amphisbaena, Typhlops,Tropidophis, Leionotui, Epicrates,Calamaria, Coluber, 

 Phyllobates, Trachycephalus, Bufo. The greater part of these genera are 

 unknown in the United States. 



In Mexico there exist a number of very remarkable types, differing entirely 

 from those of our own country, viz., the genus Heloderma (horridum,) Cyclura 

 (denticulata and punctata,) Corythseolus (vittatus,) Chamaeleopsis (Hernandesii) ; 

 besides these are several species of genera belonging to our fauna, viz., Scelo- 

 porus (torquatus, formosus, spinosus, and others,) and six species of Gerrhonotus.f 



The following remarks are made by Prof. Agassiz : "It has been already 

 stated that the present distribution of animals agrees with the distribution of 

 extinct types belonging to earlier geological periods, so that the laws which 

 regulate the geographical distribution of animals seem to have been the same at 

 all times, though modified in accordance with the successive changes which the 

 animal kingdom has undergone, from the earliest period of its creation to the 

 present day. The universal law is that all animals are circumscribed within 

 definite limits. There is not one species which is uniformly spread all over the 

 globe, either among the aquatic races or among the terrestrial ones. The special 



* For plate of Dilophyrus grandis (Gray) see Cantor, pi. xx. p. 34. 



f The most important facts in regard to the geographical distribution of rep- 

 tiles are contained in the great work of Dumeril and Bibron, by far the most 

 complete and useful on general herpetology that has yet been published. 




104 [June, 



adaptation of animals to certain districts is not merely limited to the individual 

 species. We observe a similar adaptation among genera, entire families, and even 

 whole classes. For instance, all Polypi, Medusae and Echinoderms, that is to say, 

 all Radiata, without exception, are aquatic. That large group of animals has not 

 a single representative upon any part of the surface of the globe, and during all 

 periods of the existence of our earth we find that they have been limited to that 

 liquid element. And they are not only aquatic, they are chiefly marine; but 

 exceedingly few of them are found in fresh waters. Among mollusca we find 

 almost the same adaptation ; their element also is the sea. The number of fresh 

 water species is small, compared with that of marine types ; and we find terres- 

 trial species in only one of these classes. In former periods also mollusca were 

 chiefly marine ; fluviatile and terrestrial types occurring only in more recent 

 periods." p. 195. The number of " marine species of fishes is far greater than 

 of the fresh water kinds. Among reptiles there are many which are aquatic, 

 either throughout life, or through the earlier period of their existence. But as if 

 animal life rose to higher organization as it leaves the ocean to inhabit dry land 

 or fresh waters, we find that the greater number of the aquatic reptiles are fiu- 

 vialile and but a few marine." The four great types, Radiata, Mollusca, Articu- 

 lataand Vertebrata were introduced at the beginning simultaneously. However, 

 the earliest representatives of all these great types were aquatic. We find in 

 the lowest beds which contain fossils, polypi, together with star fishes, bivalve 

 shells, univalve chambered shells, cases of worms and Crustacea, b?ing at least 

 representatives of seven of nine classes of invertebrate animals, if we are not al- 

 lowed to suppose that medusas existed also, and if insects were still wanting for 

 a time. But in addition to these, fishes among vertebrata are introduced, but 

 fishes only, all of which are exclusively marine. At a somewhat later period 

 insects come in. We find next reptiles in addition to fishes, the lower classes or 

 invertebrates, continuing to be represented through all subsequent epochs, but by 

 species changing gradually at each period, as all classes do after they have been 

 once introduced. The first representatives among reptiles are marine, next huge 

 terrestrial ones, some perhaps flying types, and with them, and perhaps even 

 before, the birds, allied to the wading tribes. Still later mammalia, beginning 

 again with marine and huge terrestrial types, followed by the higher quadru- 

 peds. And lastly, man, at the head of the creation in time as well as in emi- 

 nence, by structure, intelligence, and moral endowments." Geographical Dis- 

 tribution of Animals, p. 197.

Description of four new species of Viviparous Fishes front Sacramento River, and 

 the Bay of San Francisco. Read before the California Academy of Natural 

 Sciences, May 15th, 1854. By W. P. Gibbons, M.D. 



Hysterocarpus Traskii, Gibbons. 



Body ovate, sub-compressed. Jaws with a single row of conical teeth. 

 Opercle and preopercle with scales, and with a membrane round the edge. 

 Dorsal fin commences opposite the pectoral, has seventeen strong curved 

 spines, the first short, the succeeding ones increasing regularly in length to the 

 sixth, which is the longest, and eleven articulated rays. The spinous rays lie 

 in a groove, which conceals the first two ; the remainder project an inch and a 

 quarter above the scales, and lapping by each other alternately form, in this 

 position, a double row. 



Pectoial subquadrangular, with the lower edge rounded, and the first ray 

 short and subspinous. First ray of the ventrals shorter than the others, spinous 

 and curved. 



First three rays of the anal fin with short, thick and curved spines, the middle 

 one largest. 



Body arched, the radius of curvature being least along the anterior half of 

 the dorsum. Facial line about 45 : profile slightly incurved along the line of 

 the interparietal and frontal bones. Snout protractile, lips thick, lower jaw 

 longest. Eyes rather large and near the facial outline- Nostrils double, 

 covered with a valve half way between the anterior edge of the orbit and the 

 upper lip. 



Lateral line nearly concurrent with the back. Scale? large, deciduous. 

 Smaller on the summit of the head, and on the opercle, at the base of the tail, 

 anal and ventral fins, and on the space bounded anteriorly by the ventrals and 

 pectorals. 

 'Extreme length 6.5 in., width 3 in., weight 2 oz. 



Color. Back varying from ash color to dark brown ; irregular black patches, 

 approximating somewhat to bands, across the sides. Belly lemon yellow, 

 becoming lighter and blending with the ash color up the sides. Sides, in some, 

 punctated with black. Dark and yellow patches on the fins. D. 28, P. 18, V. 6, 

 A. 25 to 28, C 20. 



Var. B. Facial line not so angular as the other, head deeper, and less dorsal 

 curvature. 



The anatomy of these fishes is similar to that of the viviparous species 

 which I have already described, except that the uterus, instead of being bipar- 

 tite, is ovoid, having but a single umbilical cord, which returns its venous blood 

 into the portal system. Intestinal canal 6 in. long, enlarged at each extremity. 

 The specimens of this fish were presented to me for description by my friend, Dr. 

 J. B. Trask, who obtained them through the kindness of Mr. Morris, from the 

 lagoons of the Sacramento river, and from the river itself, where they are found 

 as high up as the fishermen have yet been. They are the first specimens of 

 the fresh water vivipara that have come to hand. 



Hyperprosopon argenteum, Gibbons. 



Body compressed, oval. Jaws with a double row of teeth, inner row imper- 

 fectly developed. Cheeks and opercle scaly, membranous round the edges. 




106 



[June, 



Dorsal fin commences behind the pectorals and ventrals, has eight or nine spinous, 

 slightly curved rays, first short, half as long as second, second and third half as 

 long as its succeeding one. Articulated rays 28. Dorsal groove obsolete along 

 soft rays, the spinous rays projecting above it. Pectoral cuneate, with one very 

 short subspinous ray. Ventrals with one spinous and five articulated rays ; 

 connected with the abdomen by a membrane. A space extending from the base 

 of the ventrals to the vaginal orifice 1 in. wide, free of scales. First three 

 rays of anal fin spinous^; two rows of fine scales along tbe base of the anterior 

 third ; the posterior tw% thirds situated in a groove. Nostrils double, anterior 

 ones closed with a valve. 



Back regularly arched, with a slight incurvation in some along the frontal 

 bone. Curve of the belly greater than that of the back. Latter line com- 

 mencing at the upper angle of the opercle and nearly concurrent with the 

 back. Eyes very large, irides white, with a brown crescent above. Lips thin. 

 Jaws slightly protractile. Upper lip on a line with the superior edge of the 

 pupil, and with sides nearly vertical when the mouth is open. Head ash color 

 and dark brown. Back light brown with metallic tints, silver white below 

 the lateral line ; 22 24 silver white longitudinal stripes. Scales above the 

 lateral line, around the tail and anal fin smaller than the others. Outer edge 

 of dorsal membrane, caudal and ventrals darkly punctate. Tips of the ventrals 

 black. Length, including C. 9| in., width with D. 4.5 ; weight \ lb.; D. 8 to 

 9 spinous, 26 ramose; P. 1 spinous, 20 24 ramose; A. 3 spinous, 32 ramose; C. 

 22. 



Var. A. Punctatum. Smaller than the above, with sides punctate with black, 

 head shorter, eyes smaller, dorsal outline more curved and facial outline more 

 continuous with the curve of the back than the preceding. 



Cymatogaster aggregates, Gibbons. 



Back slightly arched, lateral line not concurrent with the dorsal outline, belly 

 curved more than the dorsum. Space behind the ventrals covered with scales. 

 Head ash color. Body with eight or nine longitudinal stripes of black dots, 

 commencing below the lateral line and becoming obsolete opposite the end of 

 the dorsal fin, which are interrupted by three or four lemon colored vertical 

 bands. Back dark brown with metallic tints. Belly and tail end silver white. 

 Extreme length 5 in.; width including the dorsal, 2.25 ; weight 2 oz ; D. 21 : 

 9 spinous, first short, second, third and fourth double the length of its pre- 

 ceding one ; V. 6, first spinous ; A. 15 or 16, first three short and spinous ; 

 C. 20 ; P. 20 or 24, first short and spinous. 



Cymatogaster minimus, Gibbons. 



Back more curved than the preceding ; back brown and with metallic tints, 

 sides punctate with black, with lemon color patches along the middle. A dif- 

 fused dark brown or black spot on the dorsal about the end of the spinous rays ; 

 membranes of the dorsal, the tail and anal punctated black, ventrals yellow at 

 base, tipped with black; a diffused black patch under the pectorals. 



D. 23 or 24, V. 6, A. IS to 20, P. 20 to 24, C. 20. About the same size as the 

 preceding species. 



Var. All the characteristics of the type, but with larger scales and of a 

 lighter color. Extreme length 6 in., width 3.25. 



Of the genus Cymatogaster 1 have already described two species.

 variegatis, macula magna subhumerali oblonga (angulis prolongatis) cinerea ; 

 infra candidus, segmento abdomis ultimo lateribusque nigris, illo basi albo-macu- 

 lato, pedibus nigris, femoribus annulo albo ornatis, antennis piceis. Long. -47. 



Say, Journ. Acad. Nat. Sc. 3, 197. 



Nebraska and Texas. The largest of our species, and very distinct by the 

 large subquadrate cinereous spot just behind the base of the elytra: the outer 

 margin of the spot is prolonged along the side of the elytra, and extends on the 

 humerus : the inner anterior angle is prolonged towards the suture, while the 

 inner posterior an^le is prolonged backwards; excluding the prolongation, this 

 spot is about one half longer than wide, and the inner prolongation is small 

 compared with the outer portion, which is one third the length of the elytra : in 

 the next species the inner prolongation is large, so that the mark appears like 

 an irregular subbasal fascia, and the spot itself is not longer than wide. 



Erichson (Ins. Deutschl. 430, note) gives as synonyms D. caninus Germ., and 

 D. tesselatns Herbtt. This view appears to me entirely unfounded. The true 

 marmoratus Say, seems not to be known to the German entomologists. By in- 

 advertence Erichson also quotes the Trans. Am. Phil. Society, for the original 

 description of Say. 



2. D. Mannerheimii, oblongus, niger, pubescens, capite thoraceque fulvo- 

 variegatis, hoc punctis cinereis tribus ornato, elytris cinereo variegatis, fascia 

 subbasali extus paulo dilatata cinerea, subtus candidus, abdominis lateribus 

 segmentoque ultimo nigris, hoc basi albo-notato, pedibus nigris, femoribus annulo 

 albo ornatis, antennis obscure ferrugineis. Long. -31 '37. 



Dermestes marmoratus\ Mannerheim, Bull. Mosc, 1843, 258. 



San Diego and San Francisco, California. The small size given by Count 

 Mannerheim, enables his specimens to be referred to this species : its characters 

 are sufficiently pointed out above. The spot or fascia extends one fourth the 

 length of the elytra. 



3. D. f a s c i a t u s, oblongus, niger, pubescens, capite thoraceque fulvo varie- 

 gatis, elytris lineolis transversis cinereis fasciaque pone basin lata irregular! 

 ornatis ; infra candidus, abdominis lateribus segmentoque ultimo nigris, hoc basi 

 albo tripunctato ; antennis pedibusque nigris, femoribus cinereo annulatis. Long. 

 3 35. 



New Mexico, Mr. Fendler : also allied to the two preceding, but the fascia 

 of the elytra is not connected with the base, is not dilated externally, and hardly 

 even touches the scutel ; the latter as in D. marmoratus and Mannerheimii is 

 cinereous. 



4. D. nu bil u s, oblongus, niger, pubescens, capite thoraceque cinereo fu I voque 

 variegatis, elytris cinereo plus minusve variegatis, scutello densius pubscente ;

Dermestes dissector Kirby, Fauna Bor. Am. 115. 



Texas, collected by Lieut. Haldeman, and by the Boundary Commision ; also 




108 [June, 



in Canada (Kirby). The general direction of the markings of the elytra is 

 transverse, sometimes they are so numerous that the elytra appear dull cinereous, 

 with a few transverse black lines. 



5. D. murinus, oblongus niger, pubescens, capite thoraceque cinereo-ful- 

 voque variegatis, elytris cinereo-variegatis, scutello densius pubescente, infra

Linn. Faun. Suec. (synon. vid. Erichson, Ins. Deutschl. 429). 



Middle and Southern States and Nebraska ; probably imported. This species 

 differs from the last by the color of the antennae : the markings of the elytra are 

 less disposed to become confluent. 



6. D. s o b r in u s, oblongus, niger, subaequaliter fusco-pubescens, (sparsius 

 in elytris) ; subtus albidus, abdomine maculis nigris quadruplici serie ornato, 

 femoribus albo-annulatis, antennis obscure ferrugineis. Lonjj. -32. 



One specimen, Texas, Mr. Haldeman. This has entirely the form of D. 

 nubilus, but the uniform pubescence, and the four abdominal series of spots will 

 enable it to be readily recognized : the last joint of the abdomen is white, with 

 two lateral and two fainter internal black spots at the base, corresponding to 

 the spots on the other segments. 



7. D. talpinus, oblongus, niger, pubescens, capite thoraceque cinereo va- 

 riegatis, pilis fulvis intermixtis, scutello fulvo pubescente, elytris lineolis 

 angustis transversis cinereis variegatis; subtus albidus, abdominis lateribus seg- 

 mentoque ultimo nigris, hoc basi albo bimaculato, antennis piceis apice dilutiori- 

 bus, femoribus albo annulatis. Long. *24 '32. 



Mannerheim, Bull. Mosc. 1853, 257. 



California and Oregon ; abundant. The lines of the elytra are very narrow, 

 and occasionally are varied with fulvous hairs : the color appears from the nar- 

 rowness of the markings much darker than in our Eastern species. 



8. D. r a 1 1 u s, oblongus magis elongatus, griseo-pubescens, (maculis denudatis 

 variegatis) thorace minus subtiliter punctato, subtus albidus, abdomine griseo 

 nebuloso, antennis nigris. Long. '20'. 



One specimen, California, Mr. Child. This species is a little narrower than 

 the preceding, and from the appearance of the hair of the upper surface looks as 

 if well preserved specimens would be uniformly pubescent, as in the densely 

 pubescent varieties of D. murinus. The specimen being a female, I am not 

 certain that it belongs to this division, but have placed it near those to which it 

 seems most closely allied. The hairs of the thorax appear slightly intermixed 

 with fulvous, and the punctures are more distinct than usual. The pectus is 

 white as usual, but the abdomen is of a dirty clouded white color, becoming 

 white only at the middle of the base. 



9. D. m u c o r e u s, oblongus, magis elongatus, nigro-piceus, pubescens, tho- 

 race lateribus et apice, elytrisque versus basin densius pubescentibus, subtus 

 candidus, segmentis abdominis gutta utrinque nigra notatis, (pedibus anten- 

 nisque piceo-rufis). Long. -23. 



One mile from New York. This specimen is evidently immature, but the 

 white undersurface, marked only with the black lateral spots will enable it to 

 be recognized : the last segment of the abdomen is white, having only the lateral 

 spot each side at the base. The femora are not annulated. The appearance is 

 that of a small D. vulpinus, but the sexual characters are those of the present 

 group. 



10. D. p u 1 c h e r, oblongus, rufus, subtilius cinereo pubescens, elytris nigris 

 hurneris oblique runs. Long. *25. 



Philadelphia, Mr. Newman, in a dead oak tree. A moderately robust species, 

 uniformly but not densely pubescent, both above and beneath, and very re- 

 markable by its color. The elytra in some lights show some very faint traces 

 of striaj behind the middle. Five specimens were found.

Georgia, rare. Still longer and narrower than D. lardarius, with the hairs 

 uniformly, but not densely placed, and permitting the punctures to be readily 

 seen. The elytra show traces of slightly impressed striae along their whole 

 length.

New York, Nebraska, Texas, California. The variety is quite abundant in 

 the two localities last mentioned. Erichson describes the last segment of the 

 abdomen as having a broad black vitta ; as, however, the tip is pubescent, and 

 the lateral spots also large, it seems more natural to describe it as having two 

 white spots at the base extending beyond the middle. By comparison with 

 other species, it will be seen that this is the most common form of marking, and 

 that in the present species, the spots are merely exaggerated beyond their usual 

 size. The antennae and feet are piceous, the bases of the thighs, especially of 

 the posterior pair are covered with white pubescence.

? Attagenits cylindricornis Say, Journ. Acad. Nat. Sc. 5, 185. 



One female, Santa Fe, New Mexico, Mr. Fendler. Less convex than the 

 preceding, and easily known by the brown pubescence of the upper surface. 

 The thorax is twice as wide as long, finely p-inctulate, not very convex, broadly 

 bisinuate at base, with the posterior angles slightly produced. 



Say's description is as follows: 'Body reddish brown, with very numerous 




110 [June, 



short, ferrujinous, somewhat rigid, sericeous hairs : head blackish with an ob- 

 scure rufous frontal spot; antennae pale rufous, terminal joint dark brown; 

 mouth rufous ; thorax nearly as dark as the head ; elytra paler than the thorax ; 

 beneath piceous black; feet pale rufous.' 



4. A. dichrous, ovalis minus convexus, niger, minus dense supra longius 

 pubescens, thorace parce punctulato, utrinque ad basin impresso, elytris, antennis 

 pedibusque laete rufis. Long. *16 



One male, New Mexico, Mr. Fendler. Differs from all the others known to 

 me by the coarser and longer dark greyish hair of the upper surface ; the last 

 joint of the antennae is as long as the others united, and is slightly sinuate inter- 

 nally towards the apex. The thorax is more than twice as wide as long, not 

 very convex, shining and finely but not densely punctulate ; the base is broadly 

 bisinuate and impressed, the posterior angles are rounded. 



A. cylindricus Kirby, Fauna Bor. Am. 1 13, tab. 7, fig. 3, is unknown to 

 me ; it was found near the Rocky Mountains, and is said to have the appearance 

 of a Cryptophagus.

Megatoma ornata Say, Journ. Acad. Nat. Sc. 5, 185. 



One specimen from Texas, Mr. Lindheimer and others from New York. This 

 species has precisely the form of the next, but is readily distinguished by the fine 

 dense punctures of the thorax, and the finer punctures of the elytra. The pubes- 

 cence of the thorax forms two yellow transverse lines, one near the tip, the 

 other at the middle, and some basal white spots : that of the elytra, forms three 

 narrow dentated lines and a basal, irregular spot; the anterior and medial lines 

 are somewhat connected towards the suture. The club of the antennae is elon- 

 gated, composed of five points not very loosely articulated in the female, and is 

 broad and serrate in the male. 



2. T. inclusum, subovale, nigrum, thorace convexo, vix punctulato,

New York : I once found a considerable number in a trunk full of duplicate 

 insects: the antennae are as in the female of the last, in all my specimens.

Ziegler, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sc. 2,269. 



One female, Georgia. This species is very closely allied to T. ornatum, but 

 the less dense punctures of the thorox will enable it to be separated. The 

 specimen described by Mr. Zeigler was evidently only recently transformed, 

 and therefore had not yet attained its full color. The club of the antennae is as 

 in T. ornatum, whence it may be concluded, that the male will be found to have 

 pectinate antennae. 



4. T. tarsale, elongato-ovale, postice paulo angustius, nigrum, thorace

the elytra being gradually narrowed from the base : in all those above described 

 the body is regularly oval, beng equally obtuse at each end. The antennae of 

 the male are strongly pectinate, those of the female are terminated by a small 

 four-jointed club.

Louisiana, given me by Mr. Guex. Considerably smaller than the preceding, 

 more obtuse anteriorly, hardly narrowed posteriorly, and with the hairy spots 

 of the elytra forming distinct transverse undulated lines. The antenna? of the 

 male are strongly pectinate. 



Cryptorhopalum Guer.

San Diego, California. From the fasciate elytra, this species has the appear- 

 ance of Trogoderma, but the antennas are terminated by a very large two-jointed 

 club, which is received in an excavation just within the lateral margin of the 

 thorax. 



2. C. t r i s t e , subovatum nigrum, subtiliter cinereo-pubescens, thorace 

 sat dense subtiliter punctulato, elytris confertim punctulatis, antenrarum basi,

San Jose, California. Somewhat ovate in form, more obtuse behind than in 

 front, but broadest about the base of the elytra. The hair is fine, and dark 

 colored, although not sparse; the punctures of the thorax are not distinct, but 

 those of the elytra are quite obvious. 



Closely allied to this species must be Anthrenus a p i c a 1 i s Mann. Bull. 

 Mosc. 1843, 258. It is also from California, and (by description) differs from 

 the species here described, by the tip of the elytra, and the feet being reddish.

 subtiliter punctulato, elytris confertim punctulatis, antennis tarssique piceis. 

 Long. -09. 



Pennsylvania to Georgia. A little broader and somewhat less convex than 

 the preceding, but very similar to it in characters ; the pubescence appears also 

 less dense. The base of the antennae is sometimes testaceous; the tibiae appear 

 to be always black. 



4. C. ruficorne, subovatum, nigrum, subtiliter parcius nigro-pubescens, 

 thorace vix punctulato, elytris punctulatis, antennis tibiis tarsisque obscure

Middle and Southern States. In this and the preceding species, the middle of 

 the base of the thorax is more suddenly produced than in C. picicorne, or C. 

 triste. The apical spot of the elytra occupies nearly one third of the surface ; 

 the cinereous pubescence at its anterior portion and at the tip is more dense : 

 occasionally on each elytron, near the middle of the spot, may be observed a 

 fuscous dot.

 they are reddish brown, with the base blackish, the dark color extending on the 

 suture to the middle and not being well denned.

 The antennae and thighs are black; the tibiae and tarsi brownish; the under 

 surface is covered with white scales, portions of the pectus, and a lateral row of 

 spots on the abdomen are black. The posterior of the three elytral fascia is 

 rarely entire ; the apical spot is very small. A.adspersus Herbst, (Kafer,

Abundant in spring, on flowers, especially on those of the Peony; probably 

 imported from Europe, but now found even in California ; the larva is very 

 njurious to zoological collections. The antennae are entirely black, the club 

 narrower than in the preceding species, oval, with the three joints about equal 

 in size. The white scales of the under surface of the body are mixed towards 

 the sides and tip of the abdomen with yellow, the first segment of the abdomen 

 is entirely covered with scales.

One specimen, New York, Mr. Calverley. The club of the antennae is broad, 

 round and compressed ; the first joint of it is very small, and the second only 

 half as large as the last joint. The spots of the elytra seem inclined to form 

 three fasciae, and there is, besides, one at the middle of the base of each elytron. 

 The form of the body is that of A. thoracicus, and as in that species the first 

 joint of the abdomen has a denuded black line each side behind the coxa and the 

 white scales are mixed with yellow towards the sides of the abdomen.

Castanea pumila. This species seems to be similar to A. museorum ; but I 

 cannot discover any sexual differences in a large number of specimens examined. 

 The antennae are sometimes dark-colored towards the extremity; the feet also 

 vary in color, the thighs being usually darker than the tibiae and tarsi : the elytra 

 are generally uniform testaceous brown, sometimes the margin and suture are 

 dark fuscous.

A curious little insect, covered with long erect hair, and presenting the ap- 

 pearance of the European Trinodes ; the antennae are precisely as in that genus ; 

 the prosternum, however, is truncate behind, and the anterior coxae are moderately

 in Trinodes it is cleft as in Anthrenus, Trogoderma, &c. The legs are slender, 

 the tibiae not dilated; the joints of the tarsi diminish in length from the first to 

 the fourth, the fifth is about equal to the first. In all other characters it agree 

 with Trinodes.

Middle and Southern States, on leaves, not abundant. A specimen kindly 

 given me by Prof. Haldeman was hatched from a protuberance on the stem of 

 Rhus radicans, but as some small Hymenoptera emerged from other similar ex- 

 crescences, I think that the relation of the present genus to them is very doubtful. 



The last joint of the antennae of the male is elongated, so as to be nearly 

 equal to the others united. 



Varies in color, having the head, thorax and margin of the elytra occasionally 

 yellowish brown.

114 [June, 



The original type of this species, said to have come from Georgia, was 

 kindly given me by Dr. Melsheimer. When it came into my possession, it was 

 covered with an incrustation like mud, which induced Dr. Schaum and myself 

 to consider it formerly as allied to Georyssus. By softening and cleaning the 

 specimen, it was prepared for examination, and I then found all its characters 

 to be of the present genus. The br sties were mostly gone, but a few re- 

 mained about the head and thorax, indicating them to be short and yellowish 

 white. A few small white scales remain on the under surface, but all vestige 

 of such a covering on the upper surface is removed. I perceive no characters 

 by which it can be separated from th> European S. paleata Er. (Ins. 

 Deutschl. 470,) although a comparison of specimens is necessary before it can 

 be placed as synonymous with that epecies.

Lake Superior. Differs from the following species by its smaller size, and 

 by the elytra being broader and more obtuse posteriorly, whereby the body as- 

 sumes an ovate form, not seen in the allied species. The markings are very 

 similar to the next species, but the posterior transverse black spot extending 

 from near the margin to the middle of each elytron is not seen in B. ameri- 

 canus. The small silvery spots forming the transverse sinuated figure are 

 frequently not apparent. I have changed the name given by Mr. Kirby, as 

 it is preoccupied by a European species.

 proposed by him. The insect is of small size, broadly ovate in foyn, subacute 

 posteriorly. The antennae are longer than the head, the first four joints are 

 thick, the second being a little shorter, the fifth and sixth are somewhat less 

 thick, the seventh slender, as long as the sixth: the club is oval, not much 

 broader than the first joint, and apparently solid, though with a high magni- 

 fying power, it appears indistinctly articulated. The most remarkable char- 

 acter is that this club is received in a deep hole, each side of the thorax, on 

 the zipper surface, just behind the anterior angle. The feet are slender, and 

 formed as in Linnichus.

Cypselus melanoleucus, Baird. 



Above dark sooty brown all over, except a white band on the wing, formed 

 by the tips of the secondary quills, and a white patch on the side of the body 

 opposite the rump, and extending round so as to be separated on the rump by a 

 space of about one third of an inch. Beneath white, except the under surface of 

 the wings and tail, the sides of the body, crissum and under wing and tail coverts, 

 which are glossy soot black, leaving but a narrow interval of white down the 

 breast and belly. There may be a narrow black, pectoral collar. There is a 

 narrow light edging to the outer primary quill. 



Total length 5 inches and 8-10ths, wing 5 4-10ths, tail 2 8-10ths, tarsus 3-10ths.

Ctjlicivora plumbea, Baird. 



Above bluish grey ; beneath white. Front uniform with the crown ; eyelids 

 white, and over the eye a narrow greyish white stripe, within which is another 

 of bluish black, partially concealed by the feathers. Quills all edged with lighter. 

 Tail feathers all black ; the entire outer webs and tips of the two exterior white, 

 the third narrowly margined and tipped with the same. Bill short. Tail con- 

 siderably rounded. 



Total length 4 inches and 4-10ths, wing 1 9-10ths, tail 2, bill from front 4-lOths, 

 tarsus 6-10ths. 



Differs from C. ccerulea in shorter bill and more rounded tail, the outer 

 feathers of which are not white but nearly black. The black frontlet is also 

 wanting. Differs from C. atricapilla in absence of black on the top of the head, 

 this being replaced by a dark stripe on the side. Mr. Lawrence describes the C 

 atricapilla as having the outer web only of the lateral tail feathers white, but 

 Bonaparte states the whole feathers to be white.

 two outer primaries.) Bill and feet black. 



Length 4 inches, wing 2 i-10ths, tail 2 4'j-lOths, tarsus 7-10ths. 



Compared with specimens from California of P. minima, this species differs 

 in having the top of the head uniform with the back ; the whole dimensions 

 larger, and the bill smaller and more delicate.

 Whole back and scapulars and thighs brownish ash, with a slight' gloss of green. 

 Rump, upper tailcoverts, sides and whole under parts light cobalt blue. Tail 

 and exposed surfaces of the secondaries and tertiaries ultramarine blue ; outer 

 webs of primaries more like the rump. Tail feathers, tertiaries and outer webs 

 of secondaries distinctly barred with black. The short elongated pointed exte- 

 rior feathers of the forehead streaked with opaque greenish white, turning to 

 greenish on those more posterior ; over the eye on the eyelids, a row of silky 

 white feathers. 



Length 12i inches, wing 6, tail 5|. 



This bird is figured in Fauna Boreali Americana, Birds pi. 54. 




1854.] 119 



Differs from C. stelleri in longer and narrower crest, the deeper black of the 

 head ; the feathers on the side of the forehead streaked with white, not green; 

 the white feathers over the eye ; more grey on the feathers of the chin at base ; 

 narrower bill, &c. 



100 miles west of Albuquerque, N. M. 



Carpodacus cassinii, Baird. 



Bill very stout and much elongated, straight or even concave for four-fifths its 

 length, then gently curved. Wings lengthened ; 2d and 3d quills nearly equal 

 and longest. 1st intermediate between the 3d and 4th. Tail moderately broad; 

 quite deeply emarginate ; inner feathers nearly the one fourth of an inch shorter 

 than the outer. 



Male. Whole upper part of the head from the bill to the neck of a rich deep 

 crimson ; sides of the head below the eyes, chin, throat and upper part of the 

 breast pale purplish. Feathers on the lower part of the hind neck, back, and 

 scapulars gray, and with a dark brown central streak, and glossed all over with 

 purplish. Breast, abdomen, belly, and crissum uniform w T hite, anteriorly tinged 

 with purplish gray, laterally streaked with brown ; under tail coverts white, 

 similarly streaked. Lower part of the back and rump faintly purplish. Quills 

 and rectrices brown ; all margined with dull purplish. Secondary and tertiary 

 quills and primary coverts more broadly margined. Lesser coverts strongly 

 glossed with purple. 



The female is larger than that of C. obscurus ; wings longer ; belly immaculate, 

 streaked only on the sides. 



Male. Total length 6i inches, wing 3 7-12ths, tail 2 10-I2ths, tarsus 7 |-12ths, 

 bill on ridge 6 -12ths. 



This very strongly marked species may be distinguished by the very long and 

 nearly straight bill w r hich is larger than in any other N. American species. The 

 crimson of the head extends to the cervix as in C. purpureus ; the back is con- 

 spicuously streaked ; the lower parts white and streaked only laterally ; the 

 reverse being the case in C '. familiaris . It resembles C. purpureus most, but is 

 larger, bill, wings and tail longer, with less purple on the breast, &c. 



Camp 104, Pueblo Creek, N. M., and 75 miles west of Albuquerque. 



This species is named in honor of Mr. John Cassin, of the Academy of Natu- 

 ral Sciences of Philadelphia. 



Zonotrichia fallax, Baird. 



This species bears a very close resemblance to Z. melodia, of which it is the 

 western representative. Compared with Z. melodia the bill is considerably 

 smaller and the tail longer. The plumage above is more ashy, the streaks on 

 the back not so distinct, the spots are more crowded about the breast, but fewer 

 on the sides ; their color more uniformly chesnut brown. 



Length 6i inches, wing 2 8-l0ths, tail 3. 



Pueblo creek, New Mexico. 



Pipilo mesoleucus, Baird. 



Bill considerably curved and inflexed at edges. Tarsi short, outer claw reaching 

 a little beyond the base of the middle claw. Above nearly uniform dull olive 

 brown, except a patch of dark chestnut on the top of the head; chin, throat and 

 upper part of the breast pale reddish white, streaked on the border of the area 

 with brown ; and below this there is a central large spot, formed by the adja- 

 cent brown inner vanes of several feathers. This spot is below the collar of 

 smaller ones just described. Middle of the breast and abdomen white. Lower 

 part of the belly, crissum, and under tail coverts light ferruginous. Sides like 

 the back with a slight tinge of rufous. Wings and tail like the back, the latter 

 with rusty tips. 



Total length 81 inches, wing 3 ll-12ths, tail 4 7-12ths, tarsus 5-12ths. 



Differs from P. fusca, (which appears to be confined to the Pacific coast,) in 

 a more distinct patch of chestnut on the crown, not merely tinged with this 

 color; lighter throat, the rusty color extending further down, as do the attend- 




120 



[June, 



ant spots, and below these again, a large dark spot partially covered "by the 

 feathers, and not observed in specimens of P. fusca. The middle of the 

 breast and abdomen clear white, the rusty of crissum extending further on the 

 belly. The bill is more rounded and shorter, the tarsus shorter, and the outer 

 claw extends further on the middle claw. 



Pipilo aberti is easily distinguished by the black lores and chin, less distinct 

 spots on the throat, and nearlj r uniform under parts. 



A specimen collected by Mr. Clarke, of the Mexican Boundary Survey, at 

 the Copper Mines, appears to belong to this species. It has unfortunately lost 

 its tail. The chestnut patch is paler. A smaller race of the same was col- 

 lected by Lieut. Couch at Santa Catarina in Mexico. 



Centurus uropygialis, Baird. 



Head and neck all round, and the lower parts of the body brownish ash, 

 darkest above ; a broad frontal band of dull yellowish white, (not golden.) A 

 small quadrate patch directly on the vertex, of deep red ; rest of the upper parts 

 banded transversely with black and white, even on the rump and upper tail 

 coverts. Middle of the belly yellow, sides of the body along crissum, and lower 

 tail coverts banded with black and white, like the back. Primaries black, white 

 at the base ; secondaries with round spots on the outer web ; two central tail 

 feathers black on the outer vane with a narrow stripe of white at the base, 

 running for half the length of the feather near the shaft, and tapering to a point ; 

 inner vane banded alternately with black and white ; two exterior feathers on 

 each side banded on both vanes ; intermediate ones entirely black. 



Total length 9 inches, extent 16, wing 5, tails 4 l-10th. 



Differs from C. carolimcs in yellow belly, resembles it in character of trans- 

 verse bands above, and markings on the tails. C. flaviventris has the middle 

 tail feathers entirely black, and the rump and upper coverts white. C. 

 tricolor has the middle of belly red. C. uropygialis also lacks the golden front 

 and occiput of this and other species.

Description of Neiu Species of Viviparous JMarine and Fresh-water Fishes, 

 from the Bay of San Francisco, and from the Fiver and Lagoons of the Sacra- 

 mento.* By VV. P. Gibbons, M. D. 



In the first paper that I read before the Academy, descriptive of these fishes, 

 I placed them among the Labroids, on account of their corresponding in charac- 

 ters to this family, as established by Cuvier. Prof. Agassiz, however, in a letter 

 received from him, objects to this classification, because of the recent modifica- 

 tions which have been made in the characteristics of the Labroidae. This question 

 will be settled by a more intimate acquaintance with this extraordinary family, 

 which probably comprises a large number of species yet undiscovered. The 

 anomalous phases of animal and vegetable life in California, indicate the necessity 

 of patient and thorough investigation before coming to final conclusions respecting 

 the characters of new fishes. In my present descriptions, therefore, I place 

 these fishes provisionally in the 



Family LABROIDAE. 



Genus Holconotus. 



Head of medium size ; body subeomprf-ssed, arched ; lips thick. Snout pro- 

 tractile ; cheeks and opercula covered with scales, the latter with a thin mem- 

 brane round the edges. Teeth conical, few, in a single row in each jaw. 

 Branchiostegal rays five. Dorsal commences posterior to the pectorals ; lateral 

 line nearly concurrent. Spinous rays of the dorsal fold into a groove sufficiently 

 deep to conceal them. A narrow, naked space two scales below the base of 

 the middle and posterior portion of the dorsal ; the lengLh of this space not con- 

 stant in the same species, but present in all the viviparous genera. 



H. Agassizi, Gibbons. Curve of the dorsum and belly correspond ; a slight 

 indentation at the base of the head; jaws equal; dorsal with 9 to 11 spinous 

 rays, first one about a quarter inch long ; 2d, double or treble the length of the

 about of equal length ; soft portion at its commencement about double the height 

 of the spinous, regularly increasing to its termination, inch high. 1st ray of 

 the pectorals and ventrals spinous ; that of the former very short ; first 3 rays 

 of anal short and spinous. A space, free of scales, extending from the base of 

 the ventrals on each side to the base of the anal ; the scales lining the edge of 

 this space are folded ; in the unimpregnated state, the opposite edges of this 

 space meet. Ryes of medium size, irides varying in color with white, brown 

 and yellow; superior anterior edge of the pupil flattened; nostrils double; 

 cranium covered with mucous ducts as far down as the nostrils ; a diffused patch 

 of ducts between the nostrils and the angles of the mouth. 



Head transparent gray, dark brown or black ; back ash color, dark brown and 

 olive, with metallic tints; sides copper brown, lightening into beautiful iridescent 

 and flesh color or rose tints as they approach the ventrals. From 24 to 26 longi- 

 tudinal stripes of silver white or flesh tints below, and varying from this to yellow 

 or greenish-yellow as they ascend. Above the lateral line these stripes are nearly 

 concurrent with the dorsum, but below they are nearly straight and parallel. 

 Fins and tail irregularly marked with brown, black, olive or yellow. An ultra- 

 marine blue round the preopercle, under the orbit, and about the angle of the 

 mouth. 



Scales on the breast and along the base of the fins smaller than elsewhere.

preceding species : back with a sharp ridge, anterior to the dorsal; curve of the 

 belly slight till it comes to the base of the anal, at which point it takes an an- 

 gular turn of about 00, so as to throw the anal rays in a horizontal direction. 

 Tail turned upwards from a horizontal position, but as the fish advances in age 

 this curvature is nearly obliterated. Lateral line nearly concurrent. Eyes 

 medium size, lower edge of the orbit in a line with the upper lip. hides silver

D. 35; P. 26 ; V. 6; D. 32; C. 20. 



C. elmptictts, Gibbons. Similar in general characters to the Lar&insit, 

 body compressed, lighter and more silvery lustre, transverse bands darker, with 

 a line of dark spots along the dorsal ; edge of anal tipped with black. Extreme 

 length 9 inches, width 4 inches, weight i pound. 



Hysterocarpus, Gibbons. 

 Head of medium size ; snout protractile, lips moderately thick; body ovate,

Var. A. Facial line not so angular as the other, head deeper, less dorsal cur- 

 vature, and no black bands. 



The anatomy of these is similar to that of the viviparous species which I have 

 already described, except that the uterus, instead of being bipartite at its anterior 

 extermity, is ovoid, and has but a single system of uterine blood vessels. 



The specimens from which this description is made were presented to me by 

 my friend, Dr. J. B. Trask, who obtained them through the kindness of Mr. 

 Morris, from the fresh water lagoons of the Sacramento river, and from the 

 river, where they are found as high up as the fishermen have yet been.

 of Albany. The head is about the size and general form of Machiarodus 

 primsevus. The genus holds the same relation to Putorius that Machia- 

 rodus does to Felis.

Dr. Leidy made the following remarks. 



My friend, Mr. Hanson, has called my attention to a review of the work 

 entitled, " A Flora and Fauna within Living Animals,' 5 in the Gardener's 

 Chronicle, London, April 8, 18-'54, edited by Prof. Lindley. The language in 

 several passages of this review, would imply that the entophyta, described in 

 the "Flora and Fauna," had not been discovered by its author. This, though 

 no doubt unintentional on the part of the editor, is ypt so apt to mislead the 

 judgment of the readers of the Gardener's Chroniclp, in estimating the value of 

 the work, that I have considered it, in justice to myself, worthy of notice. 



Prof. Lindley remarks in reference to the work, " It may be true, that it dops 

 not contain much, which may not be found in Robin's second edition of his ad- 

 mirable work on animals;" and further on, says, " We would point out more 

 especially the plates, which represent the curious parasites which infest the 

 intestines of different species of Julus, for though the principal of them are not 

 overlooked by Robin, etc." 



Thus it is made to appear, as if Robin had been the discoverer of most of 

 the entophytes, described in the " Floia and Fauna," when on referring to pages 

 358, 395 and 403 of Robin's Histoire Naturelle des Vegetaux Parasites, it will 

 be found that all the vegetable parasites of the former work are duly accredited 

 to its author. 



The " Flora and Fauna " was presented for publication to the Smithsonian 

 Institute in December, 1851, and appeared in printed form in April, 1853, the 

 same year in which the second edition of Robin's work was issued from the 

 press. The descriptions in the latter of those entophyta discovered by me, were 

 taken from communications, published in the Proceedings of this Society in 1849. 



1 take this occasion to make a few remarks on a question in the same review, 

 which Prof. Lindley proposes, in reference to the nature of the entophytes above 

 indicated, whether they are to be considered as fungi or algae. Prof. Lindley 

 observes, " for our own part, we have little doubt that they are all true fungals, 

 as also are such productions as Saprolegnia, etc." In presenting an opinion 

 with so little doubt, Prof. Lindley appears not to be " an coura>it >> with a work 

 entitled, "The Vegetable Kingdom. By John Lindley, Ph. D., &c," in which 

 the diagnoses of the two families mentioned are as follows : 




1854.] 129 



Algales. Cellular flowerless plants, nourished through their whole surface by 

 the medium in which they vegetate; living in water or very damp places, pro- 

 pagated by zoospores, colored spores or tetraspores. 



Fungales. Cellular flowerless plants, nourished through their thallus, (spawn 

 or mycelium.) living in air; propagated by spores, colorless or brown, and 

 sometimes inclosed in asci ; destitute of green gonidia. 



Now all the entophyta in question, excepting such as are especially described 

 as fungi, are flowerless plants, and are nourished through their whole surface 

 by the medium in which they vegetate; aad they live in a watery liquid, (the 

 intestinal contents,) have no mycelium, and are propagated by spores in the 

 manner of many undoubted algae ; and, therefore, they agree with the former 

 diagnosis, and not with the latter. They even differ in a very important char- 

 acter from Saprolegnia, (which on page 17 of the " Vegetable Kingdom," under 

 the name of Achlya, is placed among the algae,) which possesses a mycelium, 

 as I have frequently observed in this curious plant growing upon dead flies, 

 earthworms, salamanders, &c.

The origin of the spiny dorsal is situated opposite the base of the pec- 

 torals, and the origin of the anal, opposite the space between the eleventh 

 and twelfth dorsal spines. The tip of rays, as well as the base of anal, 

 extends a little farther back than the dorsal. The base of ventrals falls upon the 

 same vertical line as that which would intersect the base of pectorals. Scales 

 of medium size; minutely serrated. 



Greyish brown above, silver grey beneath. Irregular transverse bands of 

 dark brown or black, interrupted along the lateral line, the portion of the band 

 above it is somewhat alternating with the portion beneath it. A large black 

 spot may be seen at the upper angle of opercle.

Head covered with bony plates. Opercular apparatus armed with strong spines. 

 .Mouth moderately cleft; jaw equal. Teeth on the maxillaries and front of 

 vomer; none on the palatines. Gill openings separated by an isthmus ; bran- 

 chiostegal rays six in number. Dorsals distinct; first, rather small and lower 

 than the second. Caudal rounded posteriorly. Pectorals broad and large. 

 Insertion of ventrals under the base of pectorals. A series of bony scutellae 

 running along the sides of back from head to tail. Skin otherwise smooth. 



Obs. To this genus must be referred Cottus bubalis of Euphrasen, from the 

 Baltic and Norwegian seas. 



3. Aspicottus bison, G. Greatest length seven inches and a half. Head 

 broad and large, forming a little less than the third of the whole length. Body 

 tapering rapidly backwards. Orbits raised above the surface of the skull, which 

 exhibits a parieto-occipital carina. Above and inwardly of nostrils a rough 

 plate is observable. Preopercle provided with four spines, uppermost very 

 long, extending backwards to the posterior edge of opercle ; the two next ones 

 are small and directed obliquely downwards; the fourth, may be seen at the 

 lower edge of that bone and directed obliquely forwards. The opercle has three 

 spines; a stout one along the upper margin of that bone, and two small ones 

 towards its inferior margin and directed obliquely downwards. The posterior 

 extremity of interopercle. finally exhibits the last and smallest spine of the 

 opercular apparatus. The isthmus is rather large. The first dorsal begins at a 

 very short distance from the occiput, and is separated from the second by a 

 similar small space. Its base is contained once and a half in that of the second 

 dorsal, the po-terior rays of which, do not reach the base of the caudal. The 

 caudal in itself is rather long. The origin of the anal is under the fourth ray 

 of second dorsal ; the tips of its posterior rays are almost even with those of the 

 last mentioned fin, although its base does not extend as far behind. The ventrals 

 are long and slender; their insertion being nearly equidistant between the 

 symphysis of lower jaw and the vent. The tips of pectorals reach a vertical 

 line, which would intersect the second ray of second dorsal fin.

separated by an isthmus ; branchiostegal rays, six in number. Dorsals 

 separated by a narrow space; first, rather short, and lower than the second. 

 Caudal subtruncated. Pectorals broad and large. Insertion of ventrals under 

 the base of pectorals. Skin smooth as in Scorpceuichthys. Lateral line con- 

 tinuous for the whole length of the body. 



4. Leptocottus armatus, G. Greatest length of specimens observed, about 

 ten inches. Head forming more than the third of that length, caudal tin included. 

 Surface of head and snout spineless. The only spines observable are situated on 

 the preopercle ; a very stout one terminated by three conical processi directed 

 upwards and forwards, and a small, blunt one beneath directed downwards. The 

 origin of the first dorsal is situated in a line with the posterior cutaneous flap of 

 the opercle and upper edge of insertion of the pectorals ; its base is about half 

 that of the second dorsal. The caudal is subtruncated. The anal is much lower 

 than the second dorsal and not quite as long. The insertion of ventrals is be- 

 neath the pectorals and nearer to the snout than to the vent. The tips of pecto- 

 rals extend to a line corresponding to the anterior ray of second dorsal, which is 

 in advance of the vent.

Genus SCORP^NTCHTHYS, Girard. 



Head partly covered with bony plates, without, however, any rough appear- 

 ance. A few small spines on the opercular apparatus. Mouth deeply cleft. 

 Jaws equal. Teeth on the maxillaries, front of vomer, and on the palatines. 

 Gill openings continuous; branchiostegal rays, six in number. Dorsals distinct 

 though contiguous; first rather long and of the same height as the second. Cau- 

 dal truncated. Pectorals broad and large. Ventrals inserted back of the base 

 of pectorals. Skin smooth, without either scales or plates; lateral line dis- 

 tinct and continuous the whole length of the body. 



5. Scorp.exichthys marjioratls, G. A large species, of which several speci- 

 mens were procured. The head forms the third of the length, the caudal fin ex- 

 cluded. A rather small and blunt spine is situated above and inwardly of the ante- 

 rior nostril. The snout is rounded and gradually sloping anteriorly. The posterior 

 extremity of the upper maxillary extends a little beyond the posterior rim of 

 the eye. The preopercle is armed with two small spines only, and occasionally 

 with the rudiments of a third. The other pieces of the opercular apparatus are 

 spineless. A cutaneous, branching flap, similar to those of Scorpceiia, is observ- 

 able above the posterior rim of the orbit. The first dorsal begins immediately 

 behind the occiput, with a base almost as long as the head, being composed of 

 eleven rays, the last sending its membrane to the anterior ray of the second dor- 

 sal, which is one-fifth of its length longer than the anterior one. The anal is 

 but little shorter than the anterior dorsal. The insertion of ventrals is a little 

 nearer to the anal than to the tip of lower jaw. and are composed of five soft 

 rays and a spine. The pectorals, composed of sixteen rays, are large and 

 broadly developed, extending posteriorly beyond the tip of ventrals, reaching a 

 vertical line drawn from the separation of the dorsals to the vent.

BETEROLEPIM: s* Catafkracti* 



We propose forming under the above name a new ichthyic group of the well 

 known genus Chirus, and a new one described below under the name of Ophiodon* 



The natural characters by w r hich this group or family is distinguished are : a 

 body elongated, compressed and tapering; covered with rather small scales. Two 

 long dorsal fins occupying almost the whole of the dorsal region. Verrtrals 

 situated under the pectorals. Canine teeth upon the jaws, canine or velvet-like 

 ones on the vomer and palatines. Preopercle and opercle either smooth or 

 provided with spines. The posterior suborbital sends a narrow arcade to the 

 limb of the preopercle as in the Cottcrids properly so called ; that bony arcade 

 being concealed under the flesh, skin and scales constituting the cheeks. 



CHIRUS, Steller. 



This Genus we shall, for the present, characterise as follows : a superciliary, 

 membranous arborescent flap. Mouth of medium size; canine teeth on both jaws j 

 velvet teeth on the front of vomer and palatines* Preopercle and opercle 

 without any spines. Cheek, opercular apparatus, and top of head, covered with 

 small scales. Gill openings continuous and not separated under the throat. 

 Branchiostegal rays six in number* Scales finely serrated posteriorly* Several 

 lateral lines* 



7. Chirus p ictus, G* About twelve inches in total length, in which the head 

 is contained four and a half times. Eyes elliptical, longest diameter contained 

 five times in the length of side of the head. Dorsals contiguous at their base 

 only* Origin of anterior dorsal opposite the posterior flap of opercle. Anal as- 

 long as the second dorsal ; membrane uniting the rays deeply indentated. Cau- 

 dal posteriorly sub-convex.

8* Chikus guttatus, G .Closely allied to the preceding, from which it is 1 

 distinguished by a larger eye and broader scales, the posterior margin of which 

 is much more serrated, so as to be much rougher to the touch. The origin of 

 first dorsal is situated in advance of the posterior flap of opercle* The super- 

 ciliary flap is much less developed. The caudal is subconcave posteriorly.

The second Genus of this group, for which the name of 



OPHIODON, Girard, 



is proposed, has a more elongated head than the preceding one. Its mouth is 

 deeply cleft ; canine teeth exist on both jaws, rather more developed than in Chi- 

 r?is. The vomer is possessed with similar teeth as well as the palatines, where 

 they form a very long series. Posterior convexity of preopercle provided with 

 small spines. Minute scattered scales on the head, cheeks and opercular appa- 

 ratus. Branchial apertures continuous; branchiostegal rays six in number, 

 scales very small. 



9. Ophiodonelongatus, G Largest specimen observed, twelve inches long, 

 the head forming about one fourth of that length ; the greatest depth, measured 

 at the origin of the trunk enters seven times in the total length. The thickness 

 is one third less than the depth. The body is gradually diminishing backwards, 

 both in height and depth. The upper surface of the skull is slightly concave. 

 Eyes, subcircular and quite large, their horizontal diameter being comprised five 

 times in the length of side of the head. The posterior extremity of the upper 

 maxillary extends beyond the posterior rim of the orbit. The anterior suborbi- 

 tal overlaps the upper maxillary. Six or more small spines may be observed 

 upon the posterior curve of preopercle. The upper angle of qpercle terminates 

 in an acute processus. The subopercle is very long and stretches considerably 

 beyond the opercle. The origin of the first dorsal is situated in advance of the 

 spiny limb of the preopercle, at a distance of four tenths of an inch from I he 

 occiput; it is contiguous to the second dorsal, which terminates at an inch and 

 three tenths from the base of caudal (not from its rudimentary rays). The 

 anal is nearly the same length with the second dorsal. The tips of pectoral ex- 

 tend beyond the tip of ventrals.

|ATHERINID^. 



Genus ATHERINOPSIS, Girard. 



This genus is intended to include such species of Atherina, in which the palate 

 is unprovided with teeth, having besides a mugiloid fashioned mouth ; the inter- 

 maxillaries constitute its upper arcade, exclusive of the maxillaries, which are 

 situated behind. 



12. Atherinopsis californiensis, G. Specimens measuring seven inches 

 and a half in total length were observed ; the head forming exactly the sixth 

 part of it. The body is very compressed, slender and very graceful. The cau- 

 dal fin is deeply forked ; the base of anal is equal to the length of head ; the 

 base of second dorsal is scarcely half as long as that of anal. Insertion of ven- 

 trals equidistant between the tip of snout and posterior extremity of base of 

 anal fin. Tip of pectorals not reaching the insertion of ventrals. Eye large 

 and subcircular, nearer to the tip of snout of one of its diameter than to the pos- 

 terior edge of opercle. The mouth is quite small. The head above is slightly 

 convex.

 a series of tooth shaped serratures, more conspicuous upon large and somewhat 

 dried specimens. 



Greyish brown above, dull buff beneath the silvery band. Fins unicolor, 

 dull yellowish or greyish. When the scales are removed the upper part of the 

 body is reddish brown; the lower part lighter with a silvery reflection.

 body is slender, compressed and tapering. The head, which partakes of the 

 slender aspect of the body, forms about the fourth part of the whole length. The 

 mouth is very larsje ; its angles corresponding to a vertical line which would 

 pass near the middle of the pupil. The eye is large and elliptical, situated near 

 the summit of the head and its longitudinal diameter comprised a little more 

 ti an four times in the length of side of head. The intevocular space above 

 measures a fifteenth of an inch. The dorsal and anal are rather long. The 

 caudal is posteriorly rounded or else convex upon its margin. Insertion of ven-

 dorsal and ventral lines from head to posterior extremities of base of dorsal and 

 anal fins. In specimens eight inches and a half in total length, the head is 

 found to constitute a little less than the fourth of that dimension : the greatest 

 depth, taken upon the middle of abdomen, does not enter three times in the 

 length. The mouth is small ; the posterior extremity of upper maxillary not

15. Amphistichus similis, G. Among the specimens collected, there is one 

 a female a little over four inches and a half in length, which we propose to 

 describe as a very closely allied species to A. argenteus. There are two promi- 

 nent characters which will enable us to distinguish between both species : in A. 

 argenteus the posterior extremity of upper maxillary extends beyond to a 

 vertical line which would pass through the middle of the pupil, whilst in A. 

 similis it scarcely reaches the anterior rim of the same organ. Again, in the 

 former, the second and third spiny rays of the anal are much longer than in the 

 latter. The number of rays of fins is nearly the same; the anal has three and 

 the pectorals two more soft rays in A. argenteus than in A. similis. There are 

 also eleven spiny rays to the anterior dorsal of A. argenteus.

The head is contained three times in the length, the caudal fin excluded. The 

 eye large and circular, enters less than four times in the length of side of head 

 by its diameter. The greatest depth is to the greatest length, as one to three. 

 The body is very much compressed. The insertion of ventrals is in a line with 

 the third spine of anterior dorsal, which is also the line of greatest depth. 



The coloration is not sufficiently preserved for comparative description.

16. Amphistichus heermanni, G. A specimen of this species, a little over 

 eight inches and a half in length, in affording one character proper to Holconotus 

 has left us for some time in doubt as to its generic affinities. We speak of the 

 structure of the dorsals, the anterior of which is composed of spiny rays higher 

 than the soft ones of the second. Indeed, there is a slight depression in the line 

 limiting these fins, corresponding to their point of junction ; but finding that such 

 was also the case in Holconotus, that character could no longer be of any 

 generic value. Seeing, however, that there were two rows of teeth on the lower 

 jaw as well as on the upper, and that the lips, rather thin, were not free upon 

 the symphysis of the lower jaw, we decided on placing it in the genus Amphis- 

 tichus where it really belongs. The shape and size of the mouth are altogether 

 similar to that observed in A. argenteus and A. similis. 



The body is very much compressed, of a short appearance, the nape promi- 

 nently arched, the head contained about four tim^s in the total length and the 

 greatest depth twice, the caudal fin excluded- Eye contained about four times 

 in the length of side of head. The posterior extremity of upper maxillary hardly 

 reaching the vertical of the anterior rim of pupil. 



The number of rays of the fins is the same as in A. argenteus, with an excep- 

 tion in the first dorsal, which has ten spines, instead of eleven, as in A. similis.

 species collected, about seven inches and a half in length. General shape sub- 

 fusiform, compressed ; back slightly convex from nape to posterior margin of 




136 [August, 



dorsal fin. The head is subcorneal and contained exactly four times in the 

 length, the caudal fin excluded. The mouth is comparatively large, although 

 the posterior extremity of the intermaxillary does not quite extend to the anterior 

 rim of the eye : the snout being prolonged, and the cleft of the mouth nearly 

 horizontal. The eye is subcircular and its diameter contained five times and a 

 half in the length of side of head. The anterior margin of the dorsal is nearer 

 the end of snout than to the tip of central rays of caudal. The caudal itself is 

 forked and participates of the slender appearance of the body. The origin of 

 anal is situated behind the base of the dorsal, but at the same time in advance 

 of the tip of the rays of the latter. The insertion of ventrals is situated in advance 

 of the anterior margin of dorsal ; their tip reaching the anus.

Genus POGOXICHTHYS, Girard. 



Shape of mouth as in Gila; angle of mouth provided with a small filiform 

 barbel. Body fusiform and compressed. Caudal forked. Insertion of ventrals 

 behind anterior margin of dorsal. Scales large and uniform. Lateral line below 

 middle of flanks. 



This genus represents in the western waters of North America that of Gobio, 

 to which it is intimately related. 



18. Pogonichthys injEquilobus, B. and G General form very regular, sub- 

 fusiform and compressed. Total length of specimen described, about ten inches, 

 of which the head forms a little less than the sixth part. The eye is subcircular ; 

 its diameter comprised about five times in the length of side of head. The mouth 

 is of medium size; its cleft does not extend to a vertical line which would pass 

 in advance of the orbit. A barbel, about an eighth of an inch, may be observed 

 at the angle of the mouth. The origin of dorsal fin is equidistant between the 

 extremity of the snout and the first rudimentary rays of the caudal. The caudal 

 is long and deeply-forked ; its upper lobe projecting beyond the lower, although 

 the structure of that fin is perfectly homorcercal. The anal is inserted behind 

 the dorsal. The insertion of the ventrals is situated a little behind the origin of 

 the dorsal, and consequently a little nearer the rudimentary rays of caudal than 

 to extremity of snout. The pectorals are moderate.

The scales are large ; fifty-six of these may be counted in the lateral line, 

 which, upon the abdomen, approximates more to the ventral than the dorsal 

 outline. The upper legions of head and body are greyish brown ; the sides and 

 abdompn yellowish. The fins partake of the color of the region of the body to 

 which they belong.

19. Pogoni 'hthys symmetricus, B. and G. The specimens before us being 

 in a rather poor state of preservation, a description of the species can hardly be 

 drawn with accuracy. The size of the largest is about four inches and a half in 

 total length ; the profile of body is subfusiform, very compressed, and gracefully 

 elongated. The head constitutes the fifth of the length. The eye is large and 

 its diameter contained less than four times in the length of side of head. The 

 lobes of the caudal fin are symmetrical. The anterior margin of dorsal is equidis- 

 tant between the end of snout and the extremity of central rays of the caudal. 

 The lateral line forms a gentle curve, convex downwards, upon the middle of 

 the abdomen, and nearer the insertion of ventrals than base of dorsal. The in- 

 sertion of ventrals is situated in advance of the anterior margin of dorsal, a char- 

 acter which will at once enable us to distinguish this species from P. 

 inasquilobus .

Genus LAVINIA, Girard. 



Mouth shaped as in Gila and Pogonickthys, but proportionally smaller 

 than either and unprovided with barbel. Body covered with large scales 

 as in Pogonichthys. The genus Lavinia, therefore, is intermediate between the 

 two above mentioned. 



20. Lavinia exilicatjda, B. and G. Body compressed, swollen upon its middle 

 and tapering towards both extremities. Tail more particularly attenuated. 

 Greatest depth, in advance of the dorsal, contained about four times in the length, 

 which is eleven inches, and in which the head enters five times and a half. The 

 mouth is very small ; its am>le being far from reaching the anterior margin of 

 the orbit. The eye is circular and rather below the medium size ; its diameter 

 being contained nearly six times in the length of side of head. Isthmus very 

 small; branchiostesal rays three on either side. Anterior margin of dorsal 

 equidistant between the extremity of snout and tip of central rays of caudal, 

 which latter fin is deeply forked. Base of anal longer than that of dorsal but 

 considerably lower, particularly upon its posterior third. Insertion of ventrals 

 in advance of the anterior margin of dorsal. Pectorals rather small.

21. Lavinia crassicauda, B. and G. The body in this species is less deep in 

 the middle and less attenuated behind than in L. exilicavda. The peduncle of the 

 tail is largely developed and contrasts greatly with that of the latter mentioned 

 species. The head and mouth are proportionally larger ; the former being con- 

 tained four times and a half in the total length ; and the cleft of the second, 

 although not reaching the anterior ed^e of the orbit, extends, nevertheless, farther 

 backwards than in L. exilicauda. The greatest depth is about equal to the length 

 of head. The eye is subcircular, and its diameter contained about six times in 

 the length of side of head. The caudal is less emarginated posteriorly, and 

 the insertion of ventrals situated almost under the anterior margin of the dorsal.

The scales are much larger than in L. fx/licauda,and the course of the lateral 

 line similar, being composed of about fifty-five scales. The general coloration 

 is the same. 



Specimens were procured at San Francisco, in the Rio San Joaquin, and several 

 tributaries of that basin. 



22. Lavinia conformis, B. and G. Only one specimen of this species was 

 obtained; its total length being about four inches. It is related to L. crassicav- 

 da, having like it a much more compact tail than L. exilicauda. The general 

 appearance of the fish is suggestive of L. crassicauda; the body is deeper and 

 proportionally less elongated ; the eye much smaller and the scales larger. Ano- 

 ther distinctive mark between the two species consists in the position of the vent- 

 rals, the insertion of which in L. conformis, is situated in advance of the an- 

 terior margin of dorsal, whilst it is placed slightly behind it in L. crassicauda.

 this species were collected, together with one about five inches in length. The 

 body is very much compressed, deepest upon the middle of its length and taper- 

 ing towards both extremities. The greatest depth is contained four times in the 




138 [August, 



total length. The snout is subcorneal, head rather small, forming about the 

 fifth of the total length, and slightly depressed above the eyes. The anterior 

 margin of dorsal is nearer the base of caudal than to extremity of snout. The 

 caudal is forked. Both the anal and dorsal are anteriorly elevated. Insertion 

 of ventrals situated in advance of anterior margin of dorsal. Pectorals and vent- 

 rals of medium development.

CLUPEIDiE. 



24. Clupea mirabilis, G. Specimens before us are from eight to nine inches 

 in total length, the head forming about the fifth of that dimension. The greatest 

 depth is equal to length of head. The lower jaw is longer than the upper, the 

 posterior extremity reaches to a vertical which would pass through the middle 

 of the pupil. The eye is subcircular and large; its diameter being contained a 

 little less than four times in the length of side of head. The anterior rays of 

 dorsal are almost as high as the fin is long. The insertion of ventrals is situated 

 in advance of middle of dorsal.

This species is closely allied to the common herring (Clupea harengus) by its 

 general appearance; the absence of teeth upon the palatine, the conspicuousness 

 of the vomerine teeth (which are most so of all), and the presence of but two 

 rows of them upon the tongue, will enable any one to draw the distinction be- 

 tween the two species. 



From San Francisco, Cal. 



25. Meletta C/Erulea, G. The body is slender, gracefully elongated, ten 

 inches in total length, of which the head constitutes the fourth part, not includ- 

 ing the caudal fin. The depth measured in advance of dorsal, stands in relation 

 to the total length as one to six. The body tapers away backwards from the 

 insertion of ventrals and dorsal ; in advance of these fins to the occiput its depth 

 is sensibly the same, when the head again gradually slopes, above and below, 

 towards the snout. The posterior extremity of the maxillary reaches a vertical 

 line which would intersect the middle of the eye The posterior edge of oper- 

 cular apparatus forms a uniform and rather flattened curve. The inferior branch 

 of preopercle exhibits small radiating striae ; strias more conspicuous are observed 

 upon the inferior and inner half of opercle. The anterior margin of dorsal is 

 nearer the snout than to the base of caudal. The ventrals are inserted opposite 

 the posterior half of dorsal. Caudal deeply forked ; anal long and low. Pectorals 

 of medium development and acute upon their extremity.

26. Engraulis mordax, G. The general physiognomy of this species is some- 

 what susgestive of EngravHs encrasirholus, the common anchovy of Europe, 

 from which, however, it may be distinguished chiefly by the position of the 

 ventrals, the insertion of which is exactly opposite the anterior margin of the 

 dorsal. The body is slender and compressed, sharp upon the ventral line. The 

 greatest depth is comprised nearly seven times in the total length and almost 

 twice in the length of the head. The eye is large and subcircular ; its diameter 

 being contained four times in the length of side of head. The anterior margin 

 of dorsal is nearer the base of caudal than to the extremity of snout.

 an acute snout. The head forms a little less than a fourth of the entire length, . 

 to which the greatest depth stands as one to three. The mouth is small, lower 

 jaw longest ; the posterior extremity of upper maxillary overruns slightly the 

 vertical of the anterior rim of orbit. The teeth are minute. Eyes on the right 

 side and very large, elliptically elongated and closely approximated, being 

 separated by a narrow and elevated ridge ; hence a sloping of either side of the 

 ocular region. The longitudinal diameter of the eye is comprised four times in 

 the length of the side of head. The dorsal fin begins above the eye, and termin- 

 ates, as well as the anal, at a short distance from the base of caudal. The

1. Chirus constellatus, G. This species comes nearest to C. guttatus, of 

 which it has the general physiognomy and structure of the fins ; but the head 

 above is less convex, and the scales very differently imbricated. Thus, whilst 

 in C. constellatus they constitute oblique series which may be traced in any di- 

 rection, the same is not the case in C. guttatus.

The ground color is greenish grey; the body at large exhibiting indistinct, 

 cloudy spots, and on the anterior and upper region, groups of black dots varying 

 in number. Similar dots are scattered over the upper part and sides of head, 

 and the pectoral fins are literally covered with them, so as to divide equally the 

 space with the ground color which make these fins appear maculated with 

 black and yellow.

Genus PORICHTHYS, Girard. 



General form and external aspect similar to Batrachus, but more elongated ; 

 its generic features will consist in the series of pores extending to the whole 

 length of body from divers regions of the head. There are neither scales on the 

 body nor membranous appendages on the margin of the jaws. Two short tenta- 

 cles in advance of the nostrils. The teeth are slender and acute; those on the 

 vomer most conspicuous. The head is smooth ; the opercle provided with one 

 spine only. 



Ohs* To this genus belong : 1st. P. porosessimus {Batrachus porosissimus, 

 Cuv. and Val.) from the coast of Brazil ; and 2d. P.porosus {Batrachus porosus,

3. Porichthys notatus, G. Total length about nine inches and a half, the 

 head forming the fourth of it in excluding the caudal fin. The mouth is broadly 

 cleft ; the posterior extremity of upper maxillary extending beyond the posterior 

 rim of the orbit. The teeth upon the symphysis of the lower jaw are more 

 slender and smaller than on the sides cf that bone. The smallest teeth are those 

 of the irttermaxillaries extending almost to the whole length of these bones. 

 The palatine teeth are a little larger posteriorly than anteriorly. The most con- 

 spicuous ones are observed on the vomer. Two minute and inconspicuous spines 

 constitute the anterior dorsal fin. The second dorsal is somewhat higher than 

 the anal, and the tips of the posterior rays of both of these fins reach the 

 base of the caudal, there being but a narrow space left separating these fins 

 from each other. The caudal is posteriorly rounded. The pectorals are spear- 

 shaped ; the central rays being the longest.

8. Gadus proximus, G. This appears to be a rather small species, for, amongst 

 numerous specimens brought home by several parties, and now before us, the 

 largest measures less than six inches in total length. The body is slender, 




142 [August, 



elongated and compressed, rather graceful in appearance. The head is contain- 

 ed four times and a half in the total length. The snout is pointed, the upper 

 jaw overlapping considerably the lower one. The mouth is proportionally large, 

 the posterior extremity of the upper maxillary extending to a vertical line which 

 would fall in advance of the eye. The eye itself is above the medium size, sub- 

 circular in form, and contained about four times and a half in the length of the 

 side of head. There exists a space between each dorsal, more considerable be- 

 tween the second and third, than between the first and second. The anals 

 are likewise separated by a space nearly equal to that which is observed between 

 the second and third dorsals. The ventrals are exiguous, their second ray being 

 prolonged into a filament. The pectorals are small.

It is praiseworthy for officers of the government, whether military or civil, 

 when detailed upon special duties, to devote their moments of leisure in serving 

 the cause of science. Lieut. Trowbridge, while engaged under instructions from 

 the IT. S. Coast Survey, in making tidal observations for the use of that office, 

 availed himself of such opportunities at his command to secure the fishes enume- 

 rated below, and we leave it to Naturalists to decide whether his labors were 

 at all rewarded. 



There are three main points whence specimens were obtained. 1st, Presidio, 

 on the Bay of San Francisco, where Lieut. Trowbridge himself is stationed ; 

 2d, Monterey, on the Bay of the same name, where the same gentleman made 

 several excursions; and, 3d, San Diego, where observations are conducted by 

 Corporal A. Cassidy, U. S. A.

 in the length, the caudal fin excepted, presents a subcorneal appearance, from the 

 fact of its bein.; rounded upon its upper region, and gradually sloping towards 

 the snout. The anterior part of the body, from the origin of the dorsal to the 

 occiput is continuous with the profile of the head, the middle region slightly 

 convex. The body gradually tapers backwards; the greatest depth taken 

 between the insertion of ventrals and origin of first dorsal, is a little less than 

 the fourth of the entire length, including the caudal fin ; the greatest thickness 

 measures in the same region as the depth, is a little more than the half of the 

 latter. The body, therefore, is compressed, as usual in this genus, and the

general outline subfusiform. The eye is subeircular, and its horizontal diameter 

 contained about six times in the length of side of head. The posterior extremity 

 of the upper maxillary extends to a vertical line intersecting the pupil. The 

 lower jaw is the longest. The third dorsal spine is much the longest in the first 

 dorsal fin, and higher than any of the rays constituting the second dorsal. The 

 caudal is subemarginated posteriorly. The insertion of pectorals is placed im- 

 mediately in advance of the origin of anterior dorsal ; the insertion of ventrals 

 is situated immediately behind the base of pectorals.

The scales are of medium size. The lateral line follows the curve of the back 

 and middle of the peduncle of tail. 



Ground color reddish brown above, yellowish beneath, upper part of body 

 provided with large cloud-like blackish blotches. A dark vitta extends oblique- 

 ly downwards and backwards from the lower rim of orbit to the throat, across 

 the cheeks and branchiostegal apparatus. The fins are purplish blue, very 

 intense on the ventrals, base of second dorsal, and space between the third 

 and fourth spine of first dorsal. The snout is covered with small roundish 

 spots.

2. Labrax clathratus, G. The profile of upper part of head is more de- 

 pressed, and the head more acute than in L. nebidlfer. The lower jaw is more 

 protruding, giving to the snout a pointed, instead of a rounded appearance, which 

 it has in the preceding species. The fourth dorsal spine is the longest and equal 

 in height to the highest rays of the second dorsal. The diameter of the eye is 

 contained five times in the length of head. The origin of first dorsal is situated 

 exactly opposite the base of pectorals.

TRACHINID.E s. Percid-e. 



Genus HETEROSTICHUS, Girard. 



First dorsal fin very long, the first five anterior rays of which constitute an 

 apparently distinct fin. Anal very Ions, provided anteriorly with but few spines. 

 Dorsal and anal extending to near the caudal. Body very compressed and 

 flattened posteriory. Caudal slender. Ventrals situated in advance of pec- 

 torals. Lower jaw longest ; mouth moderate. Teeth small and conical. Scales 

 very small. Lateral line arched above the pectorals. Six branchial rays. 

 Opercular apparatus without either spines or denticulations. 



3. Heterostichus rostratus, G. The head is rather small and conical, 

 contiguous to a body anteriorly deep, tapering posteriorly, and very much flat- 

 tened throughout. The nose is very much depressed and concave. The 

 greatest depth measured above the pectoials, is contained five times in the entire 

 length; the least depth is about the fourth or fifth of the greatest. The head 

 forms a little less than the fourth of the length. The mouth is moderate, lower 

 jaw much the longest ; and the posterior extremity of upper maxillary reaches a 

 vertical line, which would pass in advance of the pupil. The teeth are conical, 

 slender and exiguous. The eye is subelliptical, and its horizontal diameter con- 

 tained seven times and a half in the length of side of head. The dorsal fin 

 originates at a very short distance from the occiput. The five first rays consti- 

 tuting an apparently distinct fin, subtriangular in shape, and much higher than 

 the portion which follows, and which upon its anterior half, is higher than the 

 posterior half. The soft dorsal is short, but high and in perfect continuity with 

 the spiny one ; the tips of its posterior rays not reaching quite as far back as 




144 [August, 



those of the anal, which approximate to the base of caudal. The caudal is 

 slender and forked. The anal is very long and higher than the corresponding 

 portion of dorsal ; it is highest posteriorly and lowest upon the middle. The 

 base of the pectorals falls under the space between the third and fourth dorsal 

 spines. The ventrals are inserted much in advance of the base of pectorals, 

 immediately under the throat ; they are qaite small and slender. The pectorals 

 themselves are of but medium development.

The scales are very small, extending over the upper part of opercular appara- 

 tus to the cheeks ; also to the rays of the fins to about half their height or length. 

 The lateral line, from the upper angle of opercle runs almost straight till about 

 under the twelfth spine of dorsal, then obliquely downwards until near the middle 

 of flanks, thence straight to the base of caudal. 



Ground color above yellowish brown with irregularly transverse blotches, or 

 else interrupted, and then constituting longitudinal bands of a deeper hue. Head 

 above deep brown; upper part of opercular apparatus exhibiting an elongated 

 triangularly acute blotch, starting from the rim of the orbit. Sides and inferior 

 surface of head yellowish. Belly dull yellow. Fins yellowish, blotched, except 

 the pectorals, which are barred transversely, and the ventrals which are unicolor. 



Greatest length of specimen described about eleven inches.

SPHYR^ENID^ s. Percims. 



4. Sphyr^ena argentea, G. A specimen of this species which lies before us, 

 is thirty-five inches in total length, of which the head forms a little less than the 

 fourth part. The body is stoutish, thickest upon its middle and somewhat com- 

 pressed, the depth being about one-third more than the thickness. The mouth 

 is moderate ; the posterior extremity of upper maxillary leaves a distance of 

 three fourths of an inch between it and the vertical of the anterior rim of the 

 orbit. Teeth on the intermaxillary, minute ; on the lower jaw, moderate ; on 

 the palate, conspicuous and strong. 



The eye is subelliptical, its anterior rim a little nearer to the tip of lower 

 jaw than to the posterior flap of opercular apparatus. The scales on the cheeks 

 are smaller than upon the opercular pieces ; there are none to be seen in advance 

 of the eye. The posterior extremity of anterior dorsal is nearly equidistant 

 between the tip of lower jaw and the base of central rays of caudal. The latter 

 is deeply forked. The extremity of pectorals is very far from reaching the 

 anterior margin of first dorsal. The upper margin of both, the second dorsal and 

 anal, is concave.

The scales are of rather medium size on the flanks, smaller on the back. The 

 lateral line is straight. 



The ground color of the upper region of head and body above the lateral line, 

 is bluish black; whitish on the sides and yellowish on the abdomen. The scales 

 have an argentine reflection which extends to the sides of the head and lower 

 jaw. The lateral line is black. The membrane of the dorsal, caudal, anal and 

 pectorals is yellowish, and their rays greyish; the ventrals are uniform 

 yellowish.

COTTIDiE s. Cataphracti. 



5. Cottopsis parvus, G. May readily be distinguished from Cuttopsi* gulosus 

 by a more compact and more fusiform body, a smaller head and consequently a 

 much smaller mouth. The pectorals and ventrals are less developed, and the 

 outline of the first dorsal is more convex. The caudal is posteriorly subtruncated. 

 The insertion of ventrals is situated immediately behind the base of pectorals, 

 and a little in advance of the origin of the first dorsal ; and when brought back- 

 wards, their tip does not reach the anus. The tip of pectorals extends to a ver- 

 tical line which would pass in advance of the origin of anal. The anal is much 

 ovver than the second dorsal.

The head constitutes the fourth of the total length; it is quite depressed, and 

 slopes gradually towards the snout; its width is one fourth greater than its 

 depth. The eyes, of medium size, are placed near the summit of the head ; their 

 form is subcircular, and their horizontal diameter contained four times and a 

 half in the length of side of head. The posterior extremity of upper maxillary 

 reaches a vertical which would pass in advance of the pupil. 



Minute prickles are scattered all over the skin, more developed above the 

 lateral line than beneath it. The lateral line, itself very conspicuous, follows 

 the curve of the back uninterrupted to the base of caudal. 



Ground color yellowish brown above and on the sides; dull yellowish beneath. 

 Sides and back with darker somewhat confluent blotches, or else groups of 

 crowded dots resembling blotches. The pectorals, dorsals and caudal are barred ; 

 the anal and ventrals unicolor. First dorsal with a blackish blotch upon its upper 

 and posterior portion. Base of caudal with a black bar, upper surface of head 

 covered with dark roundish small spots.

8. Scorp.enichthys lateralis, G. We know but a few small individuals of 

 this species, the largest of which is less than four inches long. The body is 

 compressed and tapering; the head being contained about three times in the 

 length, excluding the caudal fin. The occipital region is flattened; the inter- 

 ocular space, convex, and the rostral distance, declive. The mouth is large : 

 the posterior extremity of upper maxillary extends to a vertical line, which 

 would intersect the posterior margin of the pupil. The eye is large, subcircular, 

 and placed near the summit of the head; its horizontal diameter is contained 

 four times in the length of the side of head. The interocular space is quite 

 narrow. The opercular apparatus exhibits but a double spine of moderate de- 

 velopment, situated upon the upper half of the limb of preopercle, with its point 

 directed obliquely upwards. The caudal fin is posteriorly subrounded. The 

 insertion of ventrals is situated under the middle of the base of pectorals. The 

 origin of the dorsal is in advance of base of the same tins. The first dorsal is 

 rather low, and not contiguous to the second, which is considerably higher.

SCORP.ENID.E s. Catapiiracti. 



9. Scorp.-exa guttata, G The head has a pretty rough appearance : in the 



first place, the orbits seem as if emerging from the upper part of the skull, the 

 middle line of which exhibits an obtuse groove. Three spines are observed 

 along the upper edge of the orbit, behind which three more may be seen on 

 either side of the occipital region and nape. Several supratympanic spines, but 

 small ; two diverging ones, upon the body of opercle, and four upon the limb ol 

 preopercle, the uppermost of which being much the stoutest and longest. Next 

 we see four other spines irradiating downwards from the suborbitals, and finally 

 the nasal bone terminates into a sharp and acute point directed upwards and 

 slightly backwards. Intermingled with these numerous spines there are but two 



y 13 




146 [August, 



pairs of small membranous and arborescent flaps, we were going to say, 

 adorning the head, but in reality contributing to render it still more repulsive to 

 an eye unitiated to scientific pursuits: the first pair is situated above the poste- 

 rior part of the orbit, whilst the second occupies the inner upper edge of anterior 

 nostril. The body is about eleven inches in total length, the head forming the 

 third of it. The eye is large and elliptical: its horizontal diameter being com- 

 prised nearly five times in the length of side of head. The posterior extremity 

 of upper maxillary reaches a vertical line which would intersect the posterior 

 rim of orbit. The second dorsal has nearly the same height as the first. The 

 caudal is sabrounded posteriorly. The tips of posterior lays of anal are even 

 with those of the second dorsal. The insertion of ventrals is under the base of 

 pectorals ; they are elongated. The pectorals are broad and very much de- 

 veloped ; their posterior extremity extending considerably beyond that of ven- 

 trals.

11. Sebastes rosaceus, G. The general form of this species might at first 

 be suggestive of S. norvegicus, were the central rays of the first dorsal not so 

 much higher than in the latter species, giving to that fin a decided convexity. 

 The fish is rather stout than elongated, though much compressed, the depth of 

 body being about equal to the third of entire length, which is about fourteen 

 inches, and nearly equal to the length of head. The profile from the anterior 

 margin of first dorsal to the end of snout is rather depressed, whilst it tapers 

 quite rapidly from the second dorsal backwards, the peduncle of the tail being 

 rather detached from the general shape. The upper part of head exhibits but 

 two small horizontal spines, whilst the preopercle has five of them, rather stout 

 and conspicuous. The upper part of opercle has two spines, the uppermost of 

 which is the largest. The eyes are large and subcircular, reaching the upper 

 profile of head, in the length of which their horizontal diameter is comprised four 

 times, once in advance the anterior rim of orbit, and twice behind its posterior 

 rim. The mouth is broad, but the posterior extremity of upper maxillary does 

 not extend beyond a vertical line which would intersect the centre of the pupil. 

 The second dorsal is scarce higher than the first. The posterior margin of caudal 

 is slightly concave. The second spine of the anal is strong and robust ; the 

 tips of the posterior soft rays of that fin extend somewhat farther back than 

 those of the second dorsal, but do not reach the base of the rays of the caudal. 

 The insertion of ventrals is situated immediately behind the base of pectorals. 

 The pectorals are very long, their tips extending beyond that of ventrals, and 

 reaching a vertical line which would fall between the two dorsals.

The scales of the body are of medium size ; those upon the head, cheeks, oper- 

 cular pieces and throat are quite small. The course of the lateral line is parallel 

 to the outline of the back. 



The color is of a uniform reddish or crimson tint, lighter beneath. There 

 exists, on the upper part of opercle, in the region occupied by the spines above 

 alluded to, a large, elongated spot of a much deeper hue.

12. Sebastes fasciatus, G. The species which we propose here to charac- 

 terize, has more of the general aspect of a Scorpceita, than of the genus to which 

 it belongs. The body, anteriorly, is very stout and deep, the head more rounded, 




1854.] 147 



with its upper profile more inclined from the occiput to the snout than in the pre- 

 ceding species. The total length of the fish is about eleven inches, of which 

 the head forms more than the third. The reatest depth is equal to the length 

 of head. The upper surface of the latter exhibits conspicuous spiny ridges, very 

 acute posteriorly. Five triangular spines occupy the limb of preopercle and two 

 the upper part of opercle. The posterior extremity of upper maxillary reaches 

 a vertical line which would pass behind the pupil. The outline of anterior dorsal 

 is convex and about the same height as the second. The caudal, posteriorly, is 

 subrouuded. The tips of posterior soft rays of anal are even with the tips of 

 posterior soft rays of second dorsal, and both fins approximate the base of caudal. 

 The ventrals are long and their tip reaches the vent. The pectorals are broad 

 and extend a little farther back than the ventrals, the insertion of which is 

 situated upon a line behind their base.

The scales are rather above the medium size ; those on the bead and opercular 

 bones being comparatively more developed than in the preceding species. The 

 lateral line is parallel to the outline of the back. 



The ground color is greenish sulphur yellow ; purplish black patches over the 

 head, sides of body, and fins, in the midst of which patches appear crowded 

 whitish spots. An area of ground color may be traced from the third and fourth 

 dorsal spines obliquely downwards and backwards, towards the base of the caudal; 

 in an oblique direction from the dorsal fin to the lateral line; then along the 

 course of lateral line to the base of caudal fin. The throat is deep sulphur yellow; 

 the inferior surface of the head and belly is spread all over with a more dull tint.

 tained in it three times and a half. The eye is of medium size and circular, its 

 diameter entering four times in the length of the side of head. Mouth of medium 

 size, lower jaw the longest. Upper surface of head minutely granular under a

18. Glyphisodox RUBicuxDrs, G. The head has a very short appearance ns 

 well as the body itself. The largest specimen measures nine inches and a half 



n total length, of which the head forms a little less than the fourth. The an- 



erior upper part of body is very convex^and the profile of the head very declive 



with two depression?, one above, the other below the ocular region. The mouth 



s small and the lips very fleshy. The eye is situated high up, small and cir- 



' ular, and contained five times in the length of the side of head by its diameter. 



The greatest depth, measured above the ventrals, is a little less than twice the 



length of head. The dorsal fin begins a little behind the base of pectorals ; its 



pinous portion is low and its upper margin almost straight ; the soft part rises 



'ntoa subtriangular shape. The peduncle of tail is well defined, free above and 



below j the dorsal, however, coming nearer to the base of caudal than the anal 



;oes. The caudal is very large, deeply emarginated. but the lobes are uniformly 



rounded and broad. The soft portion of anal has the same conico-trianeular shape 



as the soft dorsal. The ventrals are elongated and inserted behind the base 



of pectorals. The latter are quite broad, rounded upon their external margin ; 



their posterior extremity falling short of that of the ventrals.

 grooved between the eyes. The eye is well developed and its longitudinal di- 

 ameter comprised about eleven times in the length of the side of head; seven 

 times in advance of its anterior rim, and three times backwards of its posterior 

 rim. The anterior portion of anal is more developed than the same part in dor- 

 sal, the posterior extremity of which is but seven tenths of an inch distant from 

 the rudimentary rays of the caudal : the anal does not extend quite as far back. 

 The anterior margin of the latter is situated considerably in advance of the dor-

Genus APODICHTHYS, Girard. 



This genus is framed to include such species, as, having the general fascies of 

 Gunellus, are characterized by the total absence of ventral fins. 



The Gnnellua apos of Kamtschaka is to come under this heading, under the 

 appellation of Apodichthys apos. 



22. Apodichthys flavidus, G. The species referred to is between eleven 

 and twelve inches long. Its head is anteriorly rounded and truncated, and is 

 contained over nine times in the total length. The eye is rather small and sub- 

 circular, contained about seven times in the length of side of head. The mouth 

 is large, obliquely directed upwards, and the posterior extremity of the upper 

 maxillary extends to a vertical line which would pass behind the orbit. The 

 origin of dorsal is situated opposite the base of pectorals. A stylet-shaped bone 

 in advance of the anterior margin of anal, which is much nearer the extremity 

 of caudal than to the base of pectorals. The pectorals are short and rounded 

 upon their margin. The rays of the fins, as nearly as we can ascertain, are as 

 follows :

The scales are exceedingly small, and the lateral line not visible. 



Uniform yellowish, with a slight greyish hue. A narrow oblique black vitta 

 from eye to occiput, and a similar one from the inferior rim of the orbit to the 

 angle of the mouth. 



From Presidio, Cal. 



23. Apodichthys violacetjs, G The specimen before us is much smaller 

 than that from which the above species was described, having but three inches 

 and three-fourths of total length, in which the head is contained seven times. 

 The eye is subcircular, of medium size, and its horizontal diameter contained 

 five times in the length of the side of head. The mouth is likewise obliquely 

 directed upwards ; but the posterior extremity of the upper maxillary extends 

 only to a vertical line which would intersect the pupil. The origin of the dorsal 

 is situated immediately behind the base of the pectorals: its anterior third is 

 lower than the rest. The origin of the anal, which is much lower than the two 

 posterior thirds of the dorsal, is much nearer the base of the pectorals than to 

 the extremity of th* caudal. The latter is very small, posteriorly rounded, and 

 contiguous to both the dorsal and anal. The pectorals are short and rounded. 



I) 65. A 42. C 2. 1. 7. 6. 1. 2. V 0. P 10. 



The scales are small, but proportionally larger than in the preceding species; 

 and the lateral line, which is very conspicuous, may be traced from the upper 

 margin of the opercle to near the caudal ; from the opercle it ascends obliquely 

 for a certain distance, and then follows the outline of the back, keeping much 

 nearer the base of dorsal fin than the middle of the flanks. 



The anterior portion of body and head is of a uniform deep violet ; the posterior 

 portion exhibits a somewhat brownish ground, over which is spread a violaceous 

 tint ; the fins are all deep violet. A deep purple crescent-shaped vitta extends 

 from either eye to the occiput. Two oblique vitta? on the sides of head, start- 

 ing, one from the anterior, the other from the posterior half of orbit to the bran- 

 chiostegal apparatus. The interocular space is likewise marked with a transverse 

 narrow band slightly convex backwards.

the whole, and accordingly the bony frame alone lies before us. The zoological 

 characters of the species, as far as we could ascertain, differ from those of each of 

 the species previously described ; but having mislaid the notes taken at the time 

 of unpacking the collection, we do not feel justified in giving a diagnosis of them 

 from recollection, and merely record the species under the above specific name.

26. Jults modestus, G. Body slender, elongated, and much compressed, 

 tapering posteriorly from the origin of anal. The greatest depth, measured upon 

 the middle of the abdomen, enters five or six times in the total length. The 

 head is subcorneal, and constitutes about the fifth of the entire length. The eye 

 is large, subcircular, and its horizontal diameter is contained four times and a 

 half in the length of side of head. The dorsal commences above the base of the 

 pectorals, being quite low for about half its length, and terminating at about 

 three quarters of an inch from the base of the caudal. The origin of the anal is 

 opposite the eleventh ray of the dorsal, and extends a little further back; the 

 depth of that fin is equal to the height of the portion of the dorsal opposite to it. 

 The eaudal is posteriorly subtruncated. The insertion of ventrals is opposite 

 the posterior extremity of base of pectorals, and their tips do not extend as far 

 back as those of the latter fins.

A large specimen of this species, collected at San Diego, Cal., contained five 

 young ones, the total length of the largest beinu nearly three inches, and its 

 depth equal to the third of its length. Their bodies are light reddish orange, 

 with the peculiar longitudinal light strip?s very conspicuous. The two anterior 

 thirds of dorsals, the anterior third of anal, and the base of ventrals exhibiting a 

 deeper reddish orange ; the posterior portion of dorsal and of anal fins are rather 

 yellowish. An elongated jet black spot exists near the base of the anterior 

 portion of the soft dorsal ; the tip of ventrals is black ; the margin of the anterior 

 dorsal fin also black. 



The caudal is long and truncated ; the extremities of both the dorsal and anal 

 fins extend beyond the base of caudal as appears to be the case in the young of 

 Rhacochilns tozotes. 



From Presidio and San Diego, Cal. 



30. Embiotoca cassidyi, G. There is another species of Embiotoca, the young 

 of which exhibit the same structure ol the fins as observed in those of E. lineata, 




152 [August, 



and Rhacochilus toxotes. We have before us five immature specimens, the largest 

 of which measures but two inches and a half, and is consequently smaller than 

 the largest of E. live at a. They werp collected by A. Cassidy, and sent with 

 other specimens, without mention being made whether caught freely swimming 

 in the water, or taken by him fiom the parent hsh. At any rate they are 

 easily distinguished from those of E. Hit eat a in possessing numerous trans- 

 verse greyish bands more or less regular from head to tail and from dorsa 

 to ventral line. The anterior portion of anal, the anterior edge of soft dorsal, 

 the tip ot spines of first dorsal, and the ventrals are blackish : the remaining 

 parts of these fins, as well as the caudal and pectorals, are yellowish. The cau- 

 dal is slightly emarginated posteriorly. 



Adult specimens of this species have not yet fallen under our examination. 

 We have not hesitated in establishing it as distinct from those already described 

 after the careful study of the young in that family.

Sixteen young were taken from ihe parent body; they are from eight-tenths of 

 an inch to an inch long. A small vitelline sac is still to be observed at the ab- 

 dominal region. The general form is slender and elongated. The head is deeper 

 than the body and rounded ; the snout much less prominent than in the adult; 

 its general outline resembling more that of an adult Amphisti chits. The vertical 

 fins are much more developed than in the parent ; the caudal is rounded off, the 

 central rays being the longest. The soft dorsal and anal are likewise higher 

 and extend posteriorly to the base of the caudal if not slightly beyond it, the dor- 

 sal at least. 



Coloration uniform light yellowish ; fins whitish of an extreme transparency 

 owinu undoubtedly to their having but shortly escaped from the egg. 



Specimens were obtained at Presidio and San Diego, Cal. 



32. HoLCONorus trowbridgii, G. This species is about the size of H. rho- 

 doterus of which it has the general appearance. The body, however, is propor- 

 tionally less elongated and consequently more deep. The greatest depth, measured 

 between the origin of the first dorsal and the base of the ventrals, is contained 

 three times in the total length, whilst the head enters in it four times and three 

 fourths. The anterior portion of the body is superiorly very convex, and the 

 upper surface of head sloping rapidly towards a rounded snout terminated by a 

 very small mouth ; considerably smaller than in H. rhodoterits, whilst the teeth 

 are much shorter than in the latter species. The eye is large and circular, and 

 contained but three tim<--s in the length of the side of head ; the distance between 

 the anterior rim of the orbit and the end ol the snout is less than one diameter of 

 the eye. A line drawn vertically down from the origin of the lirst dorsal 

 would pass immediately behind the basp of the pectorals. The base of the 

 anal is compris<-d six times and a half in the total length of the fish, whilst 

 in II. rhoduterns the base of the same fin enters in the length of said species but 

 five times. The base of the ventrals is nearly equidistant between the symphy- 

 sis of the lower jaw and the posterior extremity of the base of anal ; in II. rhu- 

 doterus it is nearer to the snout.

The upper region, from the end of the snout to the base of caudal is reddish 

 brown, with irregular interspersed clouded purplish spots. The side of head and 

 abdomen are silvery. The fins are yellowish ; a cloudlike purplish spot at the 

 anterior portion of anal. The posterior half of ventral is of a deep purple.

 its location we are not prepared to give. 



33. Holcoxotus megalops, G. This species, six inches and a half in total 

 length, is the largest of its species, as far as observations go. The body is very 

 much compressed and very deep upon its middle region, tapering rapidly from 




1854.J 153 



the origin of anal backwards. The greatest depth measured under the anterior 

 dorsal, is contained a little more than thrice and a half in the total length. The 

 head forms a little less than the fourth of the whole length. The cephalic 

 region is concave. Mouth rather above the medium size, its cleft being ob- 

 liquely directed upwards; the teeth are very exiguous ; the posterior extremity 

 of upper maxillary does not extend beyond the vertical line of the anterior rim 

 of orbit, owing to the oblique position of mouth. The eye is very large and cir- 

 cular ; its diameter being contained less than three times in the length of side of 

 the head. The anal is very Ions and low posteriorly. The caudal is forked. 

 The origin of ventrals is under the second spine of the anterior dorsal.

Genus PHANERODON, Girard. 



Mouth rather small ; jaws very protractile; teeth large and subcorneal. Lips 

 not very fleshy ; lower one attached to the symphysis of the jaw. Anterior 

 part of dorsal fin gradually rising from the first to the last spine, which, however, 

 is a little shorter than the first articulated ray. Anal very low but quite long, 

 furnished with bifurcated rays. 



This genus is allied to Emhiotoca by the presence of one row of teeth only upon 

 both the upper and lower jaws, and by the lower lip in not being free all around. 

 The structure of the dorsal reminds us of Amphistlchus, whilst the shape of the 

 anal is strongly suggestive of Holconotus. 



31. Phankrodox furcatus, G. Body very flat, seven inches in total length, 

 tapering more or less rapidly backwards from the origin of both the soft dorsal 

 an, I anal. The greatest depth of body, measured above the insertion of ventrals, 

 is contained a little less than three times in the total length, in which the head 

 enters about four times and a half. The cleft of the mouth does not extend to 

 the anterior rim of the orbit. The eye is large and circular, and its diameter 

 comprised three times and a half in the length of side of the head. The inser- 

 tion of ventrals is opposite the fourth dorsal spine. The base of anal is nearly 

 equal to that of soft dorsal and lower than the latter, its spiny rays are very 

 small. The caudal is slender and deeply forked.

 length of the largest specimen before us is about three inches, the head being 

 comprised in it nearly five times and a half. The greatest depth of body is a 

 little less than the length of head, the upper surface of which is convex and but 

 siishtly declive. The eye is large and circular, and its diameter contained 

 twice and three fourths of a time in the lenth of the side of head. The origin 

 of dorsal is nearer the end of snout than to the extremity of caudal fin. The latter 

 is forked. The base of anal is almost twice as long as that of dorsal, and its an-

 tail is slightly contracted immediately behind the posterior margin of both the 

 dorsal and anal fins, which terminate evenly. From this point to the base of 

 caudal fin, the caudal region assume a dove tail shape. The caudal fin itself is 

 undulated posteriorly, the external and central rays being slightly longer than 

 the intermediate ones. The total length of the fish is about seven inches and a 

 b,alf, in which length the head enters four times and one third. The lower jaw 

 is the longest. The posterior extremity of upper maxillary reaches a vertical 

 line which would pass behind the posterior rim of the orbit. The eyes, placed 

 on the right side, are of medium size, elliptical, and their horizontal diameter is 

 contained about five times and a half in the length of the side of head. The

The month is broad in ront, but not deeply cleft; its angle extending to the 

 vertical of the anterior rim of the eye. The latter is small, subelliptical in 

 shape, and situated near the upper surface of head; its horizontal diameter is 

 contained about six times in the length of the side of head. The body is an- 

 teriorly broader than deep; it diminishes gradually in both height and depth 

 towards the origin of the tail, which is quite compressed and very much reduced, 

 and terminated by a slender caudal fin. rounded upon its posterior margin. The 

 origin of the dorsal fin is situated a little in advance of the anus, but does not 

 unite with the caudal, between which and the posterior extremity of its base, a 

 space of three tenths of an inch is left; even the tips of its posterior rays do not 

 reach the base of the caudal. The anal begins a little further back than 

 the dorsal, is as deep as the latter is high, and extends likewise a little further 

 behind; the tips of its posterior rays nearly reaching the base of the caudal.

The above enumerated mammalia may be considered as well ascertained and 



:t species. I am still uncertain whether Eucrotaphus* is distinct from 



iochcerus ; and have, therefore, not included it in ihe list. The specimens 



upon which the former genus was characterised, apparently indicate two distinct 



species : whereas, all the teeth which have been found of the latter, so far have 



indicated but one species.

Notice of a new genus of Cyprinidce. 



By S. F. Batrd and Charles Girard. 



COCHLOGNATHUS, B. & G. The jaws are armed with a spoon-shaped plate, 

 the edge of which is sharp and cutting. Pharingeal teeih disposed upon one single 

 row. The general appearance of the fish is cyprinoid, and stiongly suggestive 

 of Pimephales, the head having a rather robust appearance with a blunt snout. 

 The mouth itself is rather small. There are no barbies or rudimentary barbies 

 of any kind. The insertion of the ventral fins is situated opposite the anterior 

 margin of the dorsal. The caudal is emarginate. The scales are very large. 

 The lateral line is conspicuous, running through the middle of the flanks, slightly 

 bent dowtiwards upon the abdomen. 



Cochlognathus ornatls, B. & G. Head forming two ninths of the entire 

 length, and abruptly rounded off on the snout. Mouth proportionately small and 

 terminal with oblique cleft. Eyes rather above the medium size ; their diameter 

 being contained four times in the length of the side of head. Body much com- 

 pressed, covered with large scales disposed in twelve longitudinal rows on the 

 line of greatest depth. Lateral line inflexed downwards upon the abdomen. 

 Anterior margin of dorsal nearly equidistant between the snout and rudimentary 

 rays of the caudal. Anal, situated entirely backwards of the dorsal. Caudal 

 forked. Insertion of ventrals beneath the anterior margin of dorsal ; tip of pec- 

 toral not reaching them. 



D I. 8. A 6. C 4. 1. 9. 8. 1. 3. V 8. P 12. 



The colors, as preserved in alcohol, present a reddish brown ground, and a 

 dark lateral band or stripe. The dorsal fin exhibits two elongated dark spots, 

 one anteriorly and basal, the other posteriorly and nearer to its tip. The posterior 

 half of the caudal has likewise a darker hue than its anterior and basal half, 

 which is of a dull orange, as is also its extreme margin.

Southern States, not very rare. I see no reason why this i not Trogosita 

 bi color Fabr. (Enc. Syst. Suppl. 50; Syst. El. 1, 152): the description is 

 "corpus medium; caput ferrugineum antennis oculisque nigris; thorax laevis 

 glaber ferrugineus macula media nigra; elytra laevia nigra; corpus ferrugineum 

 pedibus nigris;" this certainly approaches quite closely to the present specie?, 

 and is very different from any of those to which other authors have applied it. 

 On account of the slight difference in the antennae, this species is made by Che- 

 vrolat the type of a separate genus Janessa (vide Dej. Cat).

Pennsylvania. Except by the sixth joint of the antennae being intermediate in 

 size to the fifth and seventh, this species only differs from the preceding by the 

 smaller size, and by the sides of the thorax being rounded only towards the an- 

 terior angles.

Kansas River. Body elongate, black shining. Head rufous, finely not densely 

 punctured. Antennae shorter than the head and thorax, black ; joints 2 6 small, 

 6th hardly wider than the fifth; 7 10 broad, transverse, subequal ; 11th round, 

 almost equal in bulk to the tenth. Thorax, about one fourth longer .than wide, 

 with the widest part about the middle, very slightly narrowed towards the apex 

 and base, broadly rounded on the sides, bright rufous, convex, finely not densely 

 punctured. Elytra with fine, punctu red, not deeply impressed striae, which near 

 the tip are somewhat obliterated ; interstices distinctly finely punctured. Be- 

 neath, the head and prothorax are rufous, with the tip of the sternum and coxae 

 blackish; the other parts are black and very finely punctulate.

One specimen from Georgia. Narrower than the preceding, and entirely 

 of the same form as L. trifasciata. Body black with a slight brassy tinge ; 

 head finely not densely punctured: antennae as in L. laeta. Thorax nearly one 

 half longer than wide, somewhat narrowed anteriorly, broadly rounded on the 

 sides, dull rufous, finely not densely punctured. Elytra with fine rows of punc- 

 tures becoming obsolete towards the tip, interstices very obsoletely punctulate. 

 Under surface black, with the exception of the prothorax, which is dull rufous, 

 with the tip of the sternum dusky.

Western States; occasionally found in Pennsylvania. The elytra are mode- 

 rately strongly punctato-striate ; the tip is almost smooth. In the female the 

 thorax is more convex and more rounded on the sides than in the male; the 

 apical margin of the thorax is frequently blackish. In both sexes the seventh 

 joint of the antennae is somewhat smaller than the eighth. The under surface is 

 sparsely punctured.

One specimen, Pennsylvania; Mr. Rathvon. Closely resembles the preceding, 

 and might readily be taken for a variety of it ; but the antennae are entirely 

 black, the postpectus and tip of the femora are also black; the limits between 

 the red and black of the plytra are badly defined; and the punctures of the under 

 surface are very much finer.

 species the description of Fabricius, with which it by no means agrees ; the 

 other authors above mentioned have merely copied the error from him. 



1 should have applied the name given by Newman to this species, were it not 

 that the size mentioned in his description (long. *6 unc. ; lat. '03 unc.) could 

 never be attained by it. The relative proportions of the length to the breadth 

 are., however, impossible in this genus, and in other respects the description 

 agrees with the species here described.

One specimen, Georgia: resembles in appearance L. puncticollis, but is longer 

 and narrower. Body rufous ; head finely punctulate. Antennae shorter than the 

 head and thorax, black, with the second to the sixth joints slender, subequal ; 

 the 7th is slightly dilated, but not more than half as wide as the 8th, which 

 again is narrower than the 9th; 9th and 10th equal, slightly transverse ; 11th 

 rounded. Thorax nearly one half longer than wide, widest about the middle, 

 broadly rounded on the sides, convex, finely, not densely punctulate, with a dis- 

 coidal oval black spot reaching from the apex to behind the middle. Elytra not 

 wider than the thorax, bluish black, with fine rows of punctures becoming obso- 

 lete at the tip. Beneath rufous, first and second segments of the abdomen 

 sparsely, coarsely punctured ; fourth and fifth segments black. Legs black, basal 

 half of the femora rufous.

One specimen found on the sea shore near New York. Body moderately slen- 

 der, dark rufous tinged with piceous and brassy; head sparsely punctured, punc- 

 tures finer towards the occiput, which is nearly black. Antennae shorter than 

 the head and thorax, joints 2 6 slender, the third being twice as long as the 

 second; 7th slightly dilated, 8th still more dilated, but not as wide as the 9th 

 and 10th, which are somewhat transverse; 11th larger, rounded. Thorax nar- 

 rowed at the base, more narrowed anteriorly; sides broadly rounded ; disc mo- 

 derately convex, sparsely, not finely punctured, with a large rounded, ill-defined, 

 dorsal spot. Elytra brassy black, shining, finely striato-punctate, striae finer 

 posteriorly, but extending almost to the tip. Under surface entirely rufous with 

 a piceous tinge, uniformly sparsely punctured. Legs fusco-aeneous, femora, ex- 

 cept at base, piceous black tinged with brassy; tarsi almost rufous.

Middle, Southern and Western States ; not rare. This species has the antennae 

 rather stouter than the others of this division, and the fifth and sixth joints are 

 a little rounded ; the seventh joint is a little smaller than the 8th, which is also 

 a little smaller than the ninth. By these characters it forms a transition towards 

 L. trifasciata, of division (B.)

Triplax Payk. 



I continue to retain Tritoma united with this genus, as the slight difference in 

 form will by no means warrant their separation. The differences in the antennae 

 cannot be considered as of greater value, since in neither of the groups are they 

 persistent ; finally, the last joint of the maxillary palpi is more transverse in the 

 genuine Triplax, being about three times wider than long, while in Tritoma the 

 breadth is only double the length. For convenience in determining the species 

 they may be arranged in several divisions.

 Long. -24, (lat. 10.) 



One specimen from Maine, given me by Prof. A. Guyot. Proportionally much 

 narrower than the next species, which it resembles in coloring, but is distin- 

 guished by the thorax being less punctured and not narrowed anteriorly ; by the 

 striae of the elytra being impressed, by the interstices having no distinct punc- 

 tures, and by the antennae being entirely black.

San Jose, California. Somewhat less convex than the other species, and di - 

 tinguished from the next, which it resembles in color, by the 8th joint of the 

 antennae being similar to the seventh. From that, as from all others of division 

 (A,) it is known by the coarser punctuation and by the very straight sides 

 of the thorax.

 the sides of the thorax being considerably rounded, instead of obliquely and 

 slightly rounded. A more detailed description is therefore unnecessary.

Descriptions of new fossil species from the Cretaceous Formation of Sage Creek, 

 Nebraska, collected by the North Pacific Railroad Expedition, under Gov. 

 J. Ji Stevens. 



By John Evans, M. D., a*nd B. F. Shumard, M. D. 



Avictda triangularis. (Nov. sp.) 



Shell small, thin, sub-ovate, length and breadth nearly equal, anterior ex- 

 tremity pointed, expanding rapidly towards the posterior extremity, which is 

 rounded below the wing; wing small, triangular; umbones inflated; beaks 

 pointed and nearly terminal, hinge margin with a well defined furrow running its 

 entire length ; surface with rounded, concentric slightly elevated ribs, crossed 

 by indistinct, radiating striae. 



Locality. Cretaceous formation, Sage Creek, Nebraska. The pearly nacre is 

 finely preserved in all the specimens of this shell that we have seen, forming an 

 elegant contrast with the dark hue of the matrix. 



Avicula lingua for mis. (Nov. sp.) 



Syn. Avicula undet. Owen, Final Rep. Geol. Iowa, Wisconsin and 



Minnesota, tab. vii. fig. 10. 



Shell very oblique, elongated, linguaeform, moderately convex ; surface smooth; 

 cardinal line straight, about equal to the greatest width of the shell ; posterior 

 wing triangular, acute, anterior wing triangular, separated from the body of the 

 shell, by the continuation of a shallow groove which surrounds its most gibbous 

 portion ; posterior edge sigmoid, forming an obtuse angle with the cardinal mar- 

 gin; anterior and basal edges convex ; beaks pointed, projecting a little above 

 the cardinal border, situated about one-fourth the length of cardinal line from the 

 anterior extremity. The mould of the shell exhibits a line of small tubercles, 

 commencing at the point of the beak and extending in a curve to the base of the 

 posterior muscular impression ; the latter is very large and somewhat reniform. 



Length one inch, width at cardinal border 10 lines, length from extremity of 

 anterior wing to posterior inferior extremity 19 lines. 



This species is rather common in the septaria of the cretaceous group at Sage 

 Creek, Nebraska, but perfect specimens are procured with diificulty. 



Solaritim flexistriatum. (Nov. sp.) 



Shell small, discoidal, depressed, convex, terminating exteriorly in a sharp 

 cutting edge ; velutions four or five ; spire very slightly elevated, inner edge of 

 volutions bounded by a row of tubercles ; surface marked by fine revolving thread- 

 like striae, which are crossed by fin< fiexuous striae, giving an exceedingly 

 neat reticulated appearance to th shell. Umbilicus large ; mouth sub-quad- 

 rangular. 



Dimensions. Width, 3i lines ; height, 1J lines. 



This pretty shell occurs quite abundantly in septaria of the cretaceous forma- 

 tion of Sage Creek, Nebraska. 




1G4 [August, 



Mytilus Galpinianus . (Nov. sp.) 



Shell sub-ovate, arcuate, inflated, surface smooth, or marked only by five in- 

 distinct concentric lines of growth ; umbones prominent, rounded, anterior side 

 short; beaks nearly terminal, muscular impression small, placed near the an- 

 terior extremity ; posterior side broad, extremity rounded. 



Dimensions. Length 7.5 lines, width 15 lines, thickness 6 lines. The only 

 specimen we have of this species is partly denuded of its shell, so that some of 

 the characters above given may have to be slightly modified, when more perfect 

 specimens are obtained for examination. 



Locality. Fox Hills, Nebraska. For this species we are indebted to the 

 politeness of Mr. Galpin, agent of the Amer. Fur Co., in charge of Fort Pierre 

 Chouteau, and to him it gives us pleasure to dedicate it. 



Pholadomya elegantula. (Nov. sp.) 



Shell sub-ovate, transverse, inflated; anterior side short, rounded ; posterior 

 side elongated, gaping; basal margin regularly rounded ; ligament margin arcu- 

 ate ; umbones prominent ; surface marked with about 45 concentric ribs, which 

 increase in width from the beak to the fyasal margin, becoming nearly obsolete 

 posteriorly ; these are crossed by about 25 radiating granular ribs, close together 

 on the middle portion of the shell, the intervals increasing in width towards the 

 anterior and posterior borders. 



Dimensions. Length 18 lines, width 22 lines, thickness 1 inch. 



Locality. It occurs in septaria of the cretaceous group at Sage Creek, Ne- 

 braska, associated with Ammonites Oweni 9 Scaphites nodosus and Inoceramus 

 Sagensis. 



Rostellaria Nebrascensis. (Nov. sp.) 



Shell elongate, conical ; whorls about eight, convex, body whorl with two well 

 rounded keels ; lip prolonged transversely, terminating in a sharp point ; all the 

 volutions ornamented with transverse revolving thread-like striae, which are 

 crossed longitudinally by prominent flexuous ribs. 



It occurs with the preceding species at Sage Creek, Nebraska. 



Descriptions of neiv fossil species from the fresh water Tertiary Formation of Ne- 

 braska, collected by the North Pacific Railroad Expedition, under Gov* J J 

 Stevens. 



By John Evans, M. D., and B. F. Shumard, M. D. 



The organic remains which form the subject of the present communication 

 were obtained from Nebraska Territory, in the vicinity of Peno Creek, a small 

 tributary of Teton or Little Missouri River, about ninety miles from Fort 

 Pierre Chouteau. They occur in great profusion in thin-bedded, light gray, sili- 

 ceous limestone, near the summit of the elevated plateaux which border the 

 Mauvaises Terres. They consist of several species of Lymnea, one Physa, one 

 Planorbisy the seed vessels of a species of Chara and the carapaces of a minute 

 Cypris. These genera at once establish the lacustrine character of the deposit 

 in which they occur. The fossils are beautifully preserved, and project in fine 

 relief from the weathered surfaces of the limestone. Many of them have been 

 converted into semi-transparent chalcedony. They are of considerable interest, 

 from the fact, that the strain in which they are imbedded, repose on the tertiary 

 marls and clays, which have yielded those magnificent collections of extinct mam- 

 malian and chelonian remains de^ribed by Prof. J. Leidy, in his recent very 

 valuable memoirs, published in Dr. Owen's Final Report on the Geology of 

 Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota, the Smithsonian Contributions, and in the Pro- 

 ceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences. 



Planorbis Nebrascensis. (Nov. sp.) 

 Shell small, depressed, discoidal, above moderately concave ; volutions about 

 four, rounded, obtusely carinated ; below rounded, umbilicus small, exhibiting 

 the volutions to the apex of the spire, suture distinct ; body whorl with an obtuse 




1854.] 165 



dorsal carina, aperture sub-trigonal, surface marked with delicate, arched striae 

 of growth. 



Width, 2s lines ; height h of a line. 



Occurs very abundantly. 



Lymnea diaphana. (Nov. sp.) 



Shell small, oblong, ovate- conic ; whorls fine, convex, crossed by delicate lines 

 of growth, spire short, acute at apex ; aperture oval, slightly dilated, rather 

 larger than half the length of the shell; columella rather delicate and sinuate, 

 umbilicus minute. 



Length, 2j lines ; width, 1J- lines ; length of aperture, \h lines. 



Very common. 



Lymnea Nebrascensis. (Nov. sp.) 



Shell ovate, sub-conic, volutions five, convex, crossed by minute, elevated 

 lines of growth ; body whorl ventricose, more than twice the length of spire ; 

 spire short, apex pointed, suture not deeply impressed ; lip produced in front. 



Length, 5 lines ; length of body whorl, 4 lines ; width about 2^ lines. 



All the specimens in our possession are very much compressed, and other- 

 wise mutilated, so that the form and character of the aperture cannot be deter- 

 mined. It is very similar to the preceding species, from which it is distinguished 

 by its greater size and its numerous crowded striae. 



PHYSA SE.CALINA. (Nov. Sp.) 



Shell small, thin, oblong-oval ; volutions four, evenly convex, smooth or with 

 very fine lines of growth ; aperture ovate, narrow, more than equal to the entire 

 length of the shell ; spire short, slightly rounded at summit, suture distinct but 

 slightly impressed. 



Length, 2 lines ; width, \\ lines. 



Only two specimens of this little shell have come under our observation, and 

 these rather imperfect. 



Cypris Leidyi. (Nov. sp.) 



Carapace minute, reniform, vertical section sub-cordate, width of extremities 

 nearly equal ; central and anterior portions of surface very convex, the convexi- 

 ty diminishing towards the posterior end; ventral margin straight or very slightly 

 concave, about one third shorter than the entire length of the valves; dorsal and 

 lateral margins convex, encircled by a well defined, narrow groove, which ter- 

 minates at the ventral margin ; surface covered with exceedingly minute gra- 

 nulae. 



Length, I of a line ; width, \ ; thickness, 2-5th. 



A close examination of the slabs of fresh water limestone from the vicinity of 

 Peno Creek, has resulted in the discovery of this pretty little crustacean. The 

 substance of the fossil is nearly transparent chalcedony, and the valves in both 

 specimens remain attached in their normal position. 



Named in honor of Prof. Joseph Leidy, whose valuable researches have con- 

 tributed so largely to our knowledge of the fossil fauna of Nebraska.

Description of some new Fossils, from the Cretaceous Rods of the Southern 



States. 



By M. Tuomey. 



The following brief characters are given in advance of more full descriptions, 

 with figures, that may follow hereafter. 



CEPHALOPODA. 



1. Nautilus. 



1. Nautilus Spillmani. Shell depressed vertically, umbilicated \ last cham- 

 ber lar^e, inflated, spreading, emarginated, flattened beneath. 



The depressed and inflated form of this fossil sufficiently distinguishes it from, 

 every other species of the genus in our cretaceous rocks. 



Inscribed to Dr. Spillman, of Columbus, Miss. 



Locality, Mississippi. Dr. Spillman. 



2. N. orbiculatus. Shell somewhat discoid, thick in the centre and gradually 

 thinner towards the circumference ; last chamber very 'arge, spreading at the 



PROCEED. ACAD. NAT. SCI. OF PHILADELPHIA. VOL. VII. WO. V. 15 




168 [September, 



umbilicus; siphunculus nearly central ; septa profoundly undulating, showing 

 on the back a sharp recurved lip. 



This is the largest of the genus found in our rocks, being ten inches in dia- 

 meter. It resembles quite closely N. D aniens, especially in the undulations 

 of the septa. 



Locality, Alabama. 



3. N. angulatus. Shell with the septa regularly curved ; emarginated ; me- 

 dium space wide, flat, obtusely angular; siphunculus large, situated towards 

 the inner margin of the chamber; aperture very w r ide. 



Readily distinguished from N. Dekayi, which it resembles, by the angles on 

 the back, and flat median space. 



Locality, Mississippi. 



2. Ammonites. 



1. Ammonites magnificus. Shell compressed, broadly oval ; whorls rapidly 

 decreasing in size, crossed by coarse nodose ribs ; nodes at each extremity of 

 the ribs, the outer nodes compressed and arranged on each side of the convex 

 median space; septa not greatly ramified, dorsal lobe deeply bifurcated. 



Bears some resemblance to A. Delawarensis, but is a very distinct species. 



Diameter tw r o feet. 



Locality, Pickens county, Alabama. 



2. A. earinatus. Shell covered with prominent, closely arranged ribs; ribs 

 nodose, a little undulating ; nodes in five revolving lines ; nodes on each side of 

 the median line compressed; median line carinated ; whorls rapidly decreasing 

 in width ; aperture ovate. 



From the preceding species this is distinguished by its more numerous and 

 closely arranged ribs and numerous nodes. 



A cast in calcareous sand, having a portion of the siphunculus beautifully 

 preserved. 



Locality, Columbus, Mississippi. Dr. Spillman. 



3. A. binodosus. Shell undulating with lines of growth; nodes in two re- 

 volving lines, equi-distant from the sides of the whorls, inner line more promi- 

 nent ; median space narrow, flat ; aperture elliptic. 



This very distinct species has a considerable part of the shell remaining com- 

 pletely silicified. 



The narrow, flat median space, the absence of ribs, and two distinct rows of 

 nodes, separate this from its congeners. 



Locality, Vance's Ferry, Alabama. 



4. A. lobata. Shell discoid, smooth, thin towards the circumference ; dorsal 

 lobe finely serrate ; lateral lobes terminating in large bilobed cells. 



This fossil, of which I have only a fragment, resembles A. placenta, but is 

 distinguished from it by the remarkable cells that terminate the lateral lobes. 

 Locality, Noxubie county, Mississippi. Mr. Richardson. 



5. A. ramosissimits. Shell remotely ribbed, slightly nodose; median line com- 

 pressed ; septa profusely foliated, aperture oval. 



The fragments of this fossil in our possession are at once recognised by the 

 very numerous subdivisions of the lateral lobes of the septa, which cover the 

 entire surface. 



Locality, Sumter county, Alabama. 



6. A- angustus. Shell with the whorls compressed crossed by distinct some- 

 what nodose ribs, each terminating in a robust knob, outside of which is a series 

 of compressed tubercles; mpdian space narrow and carinated. 



Locality, Columbus, Mississippi. Dr. Spillman. 



3. TlTRRFLlTES. 



1. T. alternatns. Shell turreted, spire dextral ; whorls angulated, lower side 

 ornamented by two tuberculated carinas, transversely plaited ; plaits double the 

 number of tubercles, alternately terminating in a tubercle. 




1854.] 169 



Two fragments of this fossil have been found. Portions of the nacreous part 

 of the shell remain, and show distinctly the deeply foliated margins of the septa. 



This is the first notice of the occurrence of the genus Turrulites in the creta- 

 ceous rocks of the United States. 



Locality , Noxubie county, Mississippi. L. C. Richardson, Esq.

 lar; margin crenulated. 



Resembles the young of O. sellteformis, and having often the habit of O. 

 equestris, being attached to branches of corals, etc., by the entire length of the 

 lower valve. 



Length 1.5 in. 



Locality, Eufaula, Alabama. Mr. Thornton. 



RUDISTES. 



Mr. Lyell was the first to point out the existence of this curious family, in 

 the cretaceous rocks of the United Slates. 



The fragments then known were referred to the genus Hippurites. From that 

 time to the present I have endeavored, with the assistance of many friends, to 

 collect the fragments of Rudistes, scattered over the prairie region of Alabama 

 and Mississippi. The result has been the determination of two genera and 

 seven species, and, what is remarkable, not a single fragment that could be rer 

 ferred to the well marked genus Hippurites has as yet been found. 



Without figures it is not easy to give characteristics of the species of a 

 family, the remains of which are so badly preserved. The following, however, 

 may serve for the present. 



Radiolites, Lam. 

 Sphcerulutes, Delam. 



1. R. Ormondii. Shell, lower valve comparatively thin, long, lamellae angular; 

 lip turned upwards at the outer circumference; ramifications of the mantle 

 slightly impressed on the lip; cells small; outer surface ornamented with verti- 

 cal ridges composed of the zigzag edges of the leaves composing the shell ; 

 inner surface smooth, with a thin plate extending a short distance into the aper- 

 ture. 



Distinguished by the thinness of the shell and ornamented exterior. The 

 fluting and apparent joints of the outer surface suggest, at first sight, a frag- 

 ment of a fossil plant. 



Inscribed to my friend, Dr. John Ormond, of Tuscaloosa, who discovered this 

 interesting species. 



Locality, Marengo county, Alabama. 



2. R. lamellosis. Shell, lower valve thick, conical, large ; lip nearly horizon- 

 tal, or slightly depressed towards the circumference, with radiating smooth 

 ridges, more numerous towards the outer circumference; outer edge slightly and 




172 [September, 



abruptly turned up ; exterior surface with vertical impressed lines correspond- 

 ing with the ridges on the lip ; cirri or ramifications of the mantle impressed, 

 dichotomously branching ; cells towards the circumference compressed length- 

 wise. 



The numerous radiating ridges on the lip are characteristic of this species. 



Locality , Lowndes county, Alabama. 



3. R. Aimesii. Shell, lower valve large, conical, very thick ; lip slightly con- 

 vex, with narrow, radiating depressions towards the inner circumference, outer 

 edge slightly plaited, with obsolete concentric undulating lines ; outer surface 

 striate. 



Inscribed to Dr. Aimes, of Montgomery, to whose kindness I owe this fine 

 fossil. 



Locality , Alabama. 



4. R. undulata. Shell, lower valve thick; lip bent slightly upwards, with dis- 

 tant, obtuse radiating ridges, or undulations, and obsolete radiating lines ; cirri 

 of the mantle well defined. 



Locality, Marengo county, Alabama. 



Ichthiosarcolites, Desmarest. 

 Caprinella, d'Orb. 



1. /. quadrat) gularis. Shell quadrangular, curved, irregular ; septa somewhat 

 regular, abruptly bent downwards, and approximating in the channel on the 

 inner surface of the shell; aperture terminating obliquely and rather abruptly. 



Locality, Noxubie county, Mississippi. Mr. Richardson. 



2. I. loricatis. Shell, aperture somewhat oval, irregular, obtusely rounded at 

 the base, giving the cast an imbricated appearance. 



Locality, Noxubie county, Mississippi. Mr. Richardson. 



3. I. eornutis. Shell, aperture regularly curved, flattened on one side, septa 

 abruptly bent downwards, and towards the concave side. 



Distinguished from the preceding by the more distant and regular septa, and 

 in the greater regularity of the curvature of the shell. 



Locality, Noxubie county, Mississippi. Mr. Richardson. 



I have thought proper to restore Desmarest's uncouth name, rather than 

 violate the rule of priority. 



Description of a fossil apparently indicating an extinct species of the 



Camel tribe. 



By Joseph Leidv, M.D. 



Mr. Henry Pratten, of New Harmony, Indiana, has sent for my inspection, 

 and as a donation to our Academy, an interesting fossil, which be discovered in 

 the gravel drift of Kansas territory. 



The specimen consists of the left intermaxillary bone, containing the fang of 

 a tooth, and a small portion of the corresponding maxillary bone. 



The fang of the tooth is the portion of a transformed incisor or functional 

 canine, like that in the Camel and Lama. The crown of the tooth was directed 

 more outwardly than in either of the latter; but it had the same form, being 

 laterally compressed, obtuse anteriorly and acute posteriorly. At the point of 

 emergence from its alveolus the crown measured 61 lines antero-posteriorly and 

 3j lines transversely. Its enamel is thin, and appears to have been smooth. 

 The fang is laterally compressed, conical, and measures an inch and a half in 

 length ; and it is strongly curved backward and downward, and is almost paral- 

 lel with the palatal margin, so that its extremity is only seven lines above the 

 latter. 



The intermaxillary bone is relatively larger and more robust than in the 

 Camel or Lama, and it is broader and more convex above. Its nasal border is 




"ty 



1854.] 17o 



more obtuse and very much less inclined, so as apparently to indicate a longer 

 snout in the extinct animal. The anterior or gingeval border is thick and rough 

 as in other ruminants. 



The small portion of the maxillary bone presents the remains of an alveolus, 

 separated from the tooth of the intermaxillary by an interval, with a curved, 

 acute margin, an inch and three-quarters long. The great distance of this 

 alveolus from the tooth in advance, when compared with the condition of things 

 in the Camel and Lama, arises from the great degree of extension backward and 

 near the palate of the fang of the first functional canine. 



The maxillo-intermaxillary suture, at the side of the fossil, descends, as usual, 

 parallel with the nasal border of the intermaxillary bone, and, after reaching 

 the palatal surface is directed in a curved line forward and inward, reaching as 

 far as the posterior third of the position of the first tooth. 



From this description it is evident the fossil indicates a distinct species of the 

 camel tribe, and as it appears generically distant from the Camel and Lama, the 

 name of Camelops Kansanus would not be inappropriate for it.

Major Le Conte stated that having visited, during the last spring, an island on 

 the coast of Georgia, known as Colonel's Island, he had been enabled to pro- 

 cure from the original locality authentic specimens of Magnolia pyramidata, 

 mentioned in Bartram Travels, p. 5. On comparison with other specimens, he 

 is convinced that it is merely a variety ot M. grandiflora ; which varies in the 




1854.] 175 



form of its leaves from a regular elliptic form to ovate-lanceolate. The di- 

 mensions of the leaves from Colonel's Island are ll inches long and 2J wide. 

 Those from other localities are, 



Of the elliptic form, transverse diameter, 7 inches, 

 " conjugate, 4 inches. 



" ovato-lanceolate 7i long, 3J- wide. 

 Regular gradations may be found between these various forms. The opinion 

 expressed by Elliot that M. pyramidata is a variety of M. auriculata is there- 

 fore erroneous. Major Le Conte also stated, that he had been personally in- 

 formed by Mr. Bart ram that his M. pyramidata had lanceolate leaves.

Catalogue and descriptions of Crustacea collected in California by Dr. John. 



L. Le Conte. 



By James D. Dana. 



1. Anomoura. 



Hippa talpoides, Say. 



Clibanarius ^equalis, D., Rep. Crust. Exp. Exp., p. 464, pi. 29, f. 4. 



This Californian Clibanarius is identical with the Madeira and Cape Verde 

 C. eBquabilis, a species which is probably identical with one at the island of 

 Tahiti, in the Pacific. See Rep. Crust, loc. cit. 



2. Macroura. 



Callianassa Californtensis, D. Pes grandis superficie laevis ; manu ad 

 basin latiore, digito mobili non breviore quam manus dimidium, subuncinato, 

 gparsim hirsuto ; carpo superficie laterali nudo, marginibus ciliato, paulo oblongo, 

 parc<i breviore quam manus, brachio crassiusculo, carpum longitudine fere 

 aequante, infra juxta basin lobum subovatum denticulatumque gerente, articulo 

 precedente infra denticulato. Manus parva angusta, carpo parce brevior. 

 Long. 2i". 



3. Isopoda. 



Idot^a Oregonensis, D., Rep. Crust. Exp. Exp. p. 704, pi. 46, f. 6. 

 This species is named I.hirtipes in the author's report, and in the plate re- 

 ferred to ; the name is changed to /. Oregon en sis in the explanation of the plates 

 accompanying the latter, on account of its having been previously used. 



Idot^ea -media, D. I. Oregonensi affinis, paulo angustior. Corpus laeve, latere 

 paulo arcuatum. Abdomen sesqui longius quam latum, lateribus fere parallelis, 

 apice arcuato-truncato ad medium apiculato. Antennae externae tertia cor- 

 poris non longiores, flagello ferme 10-12-articulato, vix breviore quam basis, 

 fere nudo. Pedes fere nudi. Long. 10'". 



The abdomen is three-jointed, with an additional suture either side of the last 

 segment, as in the I. Oregonensis. 



Stenosoma (Idot;ea) gracillimum, D. Corpus angustissimum filiforme, seg- 

 ments thoracis plerumque subquadratis, capite quadrato. Abdomen lineare, 

 apice truncatum, 3-articulatum, segmento 3-tio utrinque sutura notato. Pedes 




176 [October, 



perbreves, subaequi. Antennae externae corporis dimidio paulo breviores, fla- 

 gello lO-J2-articulato, breviore quam basis, nudo. Long. 5i'". 



Spijerillo affinis, D. Corpus superficie laeve et innotatum. Antenna? sub- 

 tilissime scabriculae, articulis duobus ultimis conjnnetis (6to 7moque) 5to parce 

 brevioribus. Seumentum abdominisultimum paulo transversum, medio constrie- 

 tum. Slyli caudales lati, latitudine basali non longiores, angulo interno-postiore 

 late excavato, lateribus antico posticoet externo fere rectis et inter sese rectan- 

 gulatis, angulo interno-anteriore truneato, externo-anteriore rotundato, ramo 

 posteriore minuto, parce exserto. Long. 4a"'. 



Porcellio gemmulatus, D., Rep. Crust. Exp. Exp. p. 725, pi. 47, f. 7. 



Styloniscus gracilis, D. Corpus gracile. Abdomen paulo oblongum, sub- 

 ovatum, thorace postico subito paululo angustius, segmentis 3tio 4to 5toque 

 lunatis. Styli caudalis basis brevis, vix duplo longior quam latus, extus ad 

 medium subito angustior. Antennae externae fere nudae, rlagello fermel4-articu- 

 lato, nudo, articulos basis duos precedentes longitudine fere aequante. Long. 

 5'". 



As in other species of this genus, the outer antennae have not the double geni- 

 culation characterising the Oniscidas. The surface of the body is smooth; yet 

 there are a few exceedingly minute hairs especially along the posterior margin of 

 the segments of the abdomen. The branches of the caudal stylets in the speci- 

 men are mutilated. 



Genus ALLONISCUS, D. Seyphacidis affinis, extremitate mobili maxilli- 

 pedis oblonga et lobata, lobis setulosis ; antennis externis, non 2-geniculatis. 

 Processus apicalis maxillipedis crasse elongatus. Styli caudales breves, articulo 

 basali ad marginem segmenti abdominis posticum adnato et fere transverso. An- 

 tennae externae 8-articula'tae. Oculi parvi. 



This genus is between Scyphax and Styloniscus in most of its characters. 

 Eut the apical process of the maxillipeds is large, as in Oniscus. Moreover, 

 the bases of the caudal stylets form a border to the last abdominal segment, so 

 that the apices of the two are brought nearly together. 



Alloniscus perconvexus, D. Corpus valde convexum, subtilissime subgra- 

 nulosum, fere laeve. Antennae externae subtiliter scabriculae, articulis tribus ul- 

 timis subaequis, articulo precedente non longioribus. Abdomen paulo transver- 

 sum. Ramus terminalis styli caudalis basi brevior. Pedes infra spinulosi. 

 Long. 6-2-'". 



Both the back and the legs in the specimens are brownish black, fn some 

 smaller specimens four to five lines long ; the color is light brown, mottled with 

 yellowish, and the legs are pale yellowish ; the form is a little more slender, 

 and they may probably be a different species. The last three joints of the outer 

 antennae are not so nearly equal. 



Lygia occidentalis, D., Rep. Crust. Exp. Exp., p. 742, pi. 49, f. 7. 



^Ega micropthalma, D. Oculi subrotundi, parvuli. Corpus superficie nudum, 

 laeve. Antennae externae longiusculae, fiagello ferme 24-articulato ; interna? basi 

 externarum breviores. Pedes fere nudi ; antici breves, articulo 4to 5-6 denti- 

 bus spiniformibus brevissimis infra armato ; 8 postici breves, apice articulorum 

 spinulosi. Abdomen 4-articulatum, segmento postico triangulato apice rotun- 

 dato et pubescente, lateribus recliuculis. Styli caudales spina, tenui et longa 

 ramis parce breviore ad basin armati ; ramis abdomen vix superantibus, breviter 

 ciliatis, interne lato, apice oblique leviter arcuato, externo dimidio angustiore, 

 breviter lanceolate. Long. 6'". 



The six epimerals either side are large, and excepting the two anterior, they 

 project behind, beyond the segment to which they belong. The eight hinder 

 legs are naked, excepting the spines at apex and one or two sets of minute 

 spines on the under side of some of the joints. 



Genus iEGACYLLA, Dana. JEgce affinis. Thoracis seirmentum septimum 

 breve et pedibus carens. Oculi permagni. Antennae, sex pedes antici, stylique 

 caudales ac in JEga. 




1854.] 177 



In the only species examined, the abdomen is six-jointed. On either side 

 there are five epimerals distinct, that of the 7th segment being wanting. 



tEgacylla Lecontii, D. Corpus laeve, nudum. Oculi fere conjuncti. Seg- 

 mentum abdominis ultimum paulo transversum ad basin latius, apice arcuato- 

 truncatum, nudum. Styli caudales abdomen vix superantes, elongate ciliati ; 

 rarao externo lanceolato, interno fere duplo latiore, subovato. Lon^. 6 2 l/// . 



The second joint of the superior antennae has a process at its apex nearly 

 as long as the following joint, and these antennae are shorter than the base of 

 the inferior antennae ; the rlagellum is about 7-jointed. The fiagellum of the 

 inferior pair is about 10-jointed. 



Spheroma oregonensis, P., Rep. Crust. Exp. Exp. p. 778, pi. 52, f. 4. 



4. Ampin' poda, 

 Orchestia Pickeringii, D., Rep. Crust. Exp. Exp. p. 882, pi. 59, f. 9. 



Orchestia Californiensis, D. Oculi majusculi. Antennae lmae perbreves ; 

 2dae crassae, dimidio corporis multo longiores, marginibus subtilissime setulosae; 

 flagello parce longiore quam articulum precedens, depresso, ferme 18 -articulato, 

 articulis non oblongis, partim transversis. Pes lmus articulo 4toangusto, infra 

 una spina, armato ; 5to angusto, breviore, processu parvo infra armato, apice 

 oblique truncato; ungui brevi, vix digitiformi. Manus 2da grandis, subovata, 

 infra palma subpxcavata, spinam versus apicem acutam gerente, digitosat longo. 

 Pedes sex postici spinulis brevibus multis ornati. Long. 1'" . 



The 7th pair of legs is but little longer than the 6th, and much longer than 

 the 5th. 



Allorchestes angustus, D. Epimerae perlatae, 4ta multo latiore quam 

 ionga, 5ta angusta subaeque bilobata. Pedes lmi debiles, manu paulo oblonga, 

 apice truncata, palma terminali bilobata, carpo subtriangulato. Manus se- 

 cunda, subovata, palma rectiuscula, inermi, narce pubescente ; carpus brevis, 

 processu tenui infra prolongatus. Pedes sequentes nudiusculi, marginibus articu- 

 lorum postici nudis, spinulis totis parvulis et reniotis. Long. AV". 



Owing to the broad epimerals, the animal is narrow with high sides.

Genus HYPOTRIORCHIS, Boie. 



Hypotriorchis attrantius, Gmel. Orange breasted Falcon. 

 Falco " Syst. Nat. vol. i. part. i. p. 283. 



Latham's Birds, vol. i. p. 289. 



i( femoralis, Tem'm. PI. col. vol. i. pi. 121 and 343. 



Male. Head, wings and back, light slate color; the primaries being of a 

 darker hue, and in their inner vanes barred with white, with which also the ter- 

 tiaries are tipped. A white line starting from above the eye extends down the 

 occiput, becoming rufous as it forms a collar on the hind neck. A deep slate 

 colored moustache descends from the angle of the mouth, one half inch on the 

 throat; auriculars of the same color. Chin, white. Breast, orange or yellow- 

 ish white, and in some specimens marked with elongated spots of black. Abdo- 

 men, thighs and under coverts of the tail, rufous. Sides and flanks, dusky black; 

 each feather being banded with delicate transverse white lines, and often uniting 

 so as to form a band in front, at the junction of the breast and abdomen. In 

 some specimens this band does not appear, as the dusky black feathers do not in 

 all cases extend across the abdomen. Tail, light gray slate color, is composed 

 of twelve faathers crossed by nine white bars; the ends of all these feathers 

 being tipped with white, except the two centre ones. Legs, yellow. Bill, yel- 

 low, tipped with bluish black. Length, 14 inches. 




178 [October, 



Female resembles the male, but its colors are less brilliant and marked. 



The young bird has the back and tail of a dusky brown, each feather being 

 fringed with a narrow border of lighter shade. Primaries and tertiaries, edged 

 with white. Breast, yellowish white, covered with a broad band of dusky black 

 extending down to the thighs ; these feathers being often edged with light clay- 

 ish color. Moustache and auriculars, dusky brown. 



I saw this bird twice on the vast plains of New Mexico, near the United 

 States line, before procuring it, flying over the prairies in search of small birds 

 and mice, and at times hovering, as is the wont of our common sparrow hawk, 

 {Tin. sparverius.) We possess little information relative to its habits from those 

 authors who have written on this bird. It appears to be a resident of Surinam, 

 Cayenne, Brazil, Chili and other portions of South America, and is used in Chili 

 for hunting the partridge. Besides this species, the American Ibis {Ibis Mexi- 

 eannSf) also from South America, comes yearly to incubate in California; and 

 further researches will doubtless still add to our fauna from that country and 

 Mexico. 



Genus PHALACROCORAX, Briss. 



Phat.acrocorax penicillatus. Brandt. Brandt's Cormorant. 



The specimens in my collection, captured on the Ferrea Leones Islands, are, 

 I take it, the same as that described by Brandt under the above title. Not 

 having the work in which he describes the P. penicillatus, I have resorted, for 

 the purpose of comparison, to a specimen so labelled, and purporting to come 

 from North America, in the Museum of the Academy of Nat. Sciences of Phila- 

 delphia. They tally exactly in their color and markings, though they differ in 

 size. The tail is greyish black, composed of twelve feathers. Feet, black. Bill, 

 dusky, but of a lighter color towards base of lower mandible. Gular sac, blue, 

 and at its base, a gorgelet of dirty white. Plumage of back of head, sides of 

 neck and to the middle of the back, interspersed with white linear feathers, 

 varying from two lines to two inches in length. Head, neck and abdomen, black, 

 with glossy reflections of green and blue. Back, black, with glossy green re- 

 flections, each feather being margined with a narrow fringe of bluish black. 



Dimensions of the Academy's specimen. Length, 24 inches. From flexure to 

 tip of wing, 10 inches. From point of bill to angle of mouth, 3j inches. Length 

 of outer toe, 3 3-8ths inches ; of second toe, 3 inches ; of inner toe, 1 j in. 



Dimensions of my specimen. Length, 28 inches. From flexure to tip of wing, 

 Hi inches. From point of bill to an^le of mouth, 4 in. Length of outer toe, 

 3| in. ; second toe, 3| in. ; inner toe, \\ in.^ 



The bill in my specimen is stouter, the gular sac extends further down the 

 throat, and the bare space around the eye is larger. Both specimens are in full 

 spring plumage. 



Late in June, these birds were quite numerous at the west end of the island, 

 and did not appear to associate with the other species; but flocking together on 

 the most elevated rocks, passed the after part of the day in a state of repose, the 

 morning having been employed in pursuit of fish, upon which they prey. This 

 bird was not incubating at that period, as was the P. Townsendii and P. splen- 

 dens. 



Genus ACTIDURUS, Bonap. 



Actidurtjs n^vius, nobis. Mottled Grass Plover. 



Form. Bill, slender, as long as the head ; culmen, straight ; sides, compressed 

 towards the tip, which is slightly curved ; nostrils, linear. Wings, pointed, 

 reaching to the end of the tail, the first primary being the longest. Tail, long, 

 broad and rounded, the central feathers longest. Tarsae and toes long. Claws, 

 short and acute. 



The feathers of the upper parts, black in their centre, with broad margins of 

 light yellowish brown. Primaries, brown, the ends being black, narrowly tipped 

 with white. Under surface, white, becoming mottled with black 2J inches from 

 their termini, which there change to a grayish hue. Under wing coverts, black, 

 spotted with a very faint yellowish ochre and tipped with white. Under parts, 




1854.] 179 



pale yellow ochre, the feathers bordered with faint white; those of the breast, 

 near the pinion of the wing, having in their centre a linear spot of black. The 

 lower part of abdomen and vent are of a much paler hue than the breast. Tail, 

 brown on its upper surface, the two middle feathers having a bronzed tinge, the 

 others being tipped with yellowish white, followed by a black band; under sur- 

 face, grayish, the inner vanes being mottled with minute brown spots. Bill, 

 black. Feet, light yellow. Length 7a inches. 



While riding on the prairie near San Antonio, my attention was called to this 

 bird from its lesser size than Bartram's Tatler, (Actidurus Bartramius,) which 

 there abounds. It ran nimbly on the ground among the grass in search of in- 

 sects, uttering, when disturbed, a weak tweet, two or three times repeated. 

 The birds of this genus, unlike the Tringae, (which congregate in large flocks, 

 showing a preference for the sea shore.) migrate in small parties, resorting to 

 the fresh water ponds and streams of the interior, or seek their food on the broad 

 grassy plains, and run with great celerity. If alarmed, they fly with rapidity, 

 making wide, circuitous sweeps before alighting. When wounded, they take to 

 the water, swimming with facility and often diving to escape danger. The nest, 

 formed of grasses and containing four eggs, is placed on the ground which has 

 been previously hollowed out. When disturbed during the breeding season, the 

 female, flying a short distance from her nest, throws herself on the ground, flut- 

 tering along as if wounded, and thus decoys the intruder into following her away. 

 Once at a safe distance, she takes to wing, returning to her home by a circuitous 

 route. 



Genus PODICEPS, Lath. 

 Podiceps Californicus, nobis . California Grebe. 



Form. Size, small. Bill, slender, slightly curved upwards. Wings, short : 

 first quill of primaries, slightly longest; secondaries, short ; tertiaries, longer, 

 nearly equal to the primaries. Tarsae, flattened ; feet, large. 



Color. The entire upper parts of a deep, sooty brown, darkest and nearly 

 black on top of the head and the back. Neck, almost encircled with grayish 

 white, and in front with an indistinct band of grayish brown. Sides and flanks 

 tinged with brownish gray. Under parts, silky white and near the vent having 

 a sullied appearance. Under wing coverts, white. Some of the shorter pri- 

 maries, of a cinereous brown, faintly tipped w r ith white. Secondaries, white, 

 of which a few have their outer webs brown. Bill, dark, tipped with lighter 

 horn color. Feet, dark green. Length, 12 inches. 



At first sight this bird appears very closely allied to the P. cbrnutus and P. 

 auritus, but on comparing them, marked differences are at once perceived, both 

 in size and form. I observed this grebe on the inland fresh water ponds, as well 

 as on the sea shore, where it was abundant, passing its time on the water, in 

 pursuit of insects and small fish, with which, on dissection, I found its stomach 

 filled. Having procured it only during the winter, I am unable to describe its 

 spring livery, and between the two seasons there is much difference of plumage 

 in this genus. 



Genus PODYLYMBUS, Lesson. 

 Podylymbus lineatus, vohis. Lineated Diver. 



Form. Size, small. Bill, short and strong; nostrils, conspicuous. Wings, 

 short ; the 2d primary the longest ; secondaries, short ; tertiaries, longer than 

 secondaries. Feet, large. 



Color. Entire upper parts, dark reddish brown. A white line from base of up 

 per mandible, under the eye, and running down the neck, succeeded by another 

 under it of reddish brown. Spots at the base of under mandible, reddish brown. 

 Throat, white, marked with a few obscure spots of reddish brown. Lower 

 neck, in front and upper part of breast, pale reddish brown, with which the 

 sides and flanks are also tinged. Other under parts, silky white, the lower 

 portion of abdomen and vent, mouse color. Quills, dark cinereous; secondaries, 

 tipped with white. Bill, horn color. Feet black. Length, 11 inches. 




180 [October, 



This bird I procured during the summer, but it is found on the fresh 

 water courses and marshy lakes of California throughout the year. The nest, com- 

 posed of a few loose straws 01 rushes, is placed on the ground, near the edge of 

 the marsh, and contains four eggs of a dirty white color. 



Description of four new species of Kivostemum. 

 By John Le Conte. 



The genus Kinosternum, as defined by the latest writers on Herpetology, is 

 described as follows : Head subquadrangular, pyramidal ; cranium with only one 

 rhomboidal plate; jaws a little hooked, papillae under the chin. Sternum oval, 

 moveable, both anteriorly and posteriorly on a fixed piece, furnished with eleven 

 plates, wings short, narrow, subhorizontal, the axillary plate very large, the in- 

 guiual still larger. Vertebral scuta slightly imbricate. Tail long, in the males 

 unguiculate. 



A comparison is made of this genus with Staurotypus, to which it in reality 

 has some affinity, but not so much as M. Dumeril supposes. It, indeed, does not 

 fall into the same group when the Testudinata are properly arranged, but the 

 Staurotypus, as will be shewn hereafter, is extremely different and has a mani- 

 fest relation with the Emysaurtts. M. Dumeril slates that the elastic ligaments 

 which retain the two moveable portions to the fixed intermediate part 'of the 

 sternum, are situated, one under the suture of the pectoral and abdominal scuta, 

 and the other under these la,st and the pectorals. Now it must be observed that 

 the moveable portions of the sternum are not in every species joined by a liga- 

 ment to the middle or abdominal piece; in many it is only the anterior one which 

 is, and which of course turns as upon a hinge ; the posterior portion is joined by 

 a suture, which is only moveable in the same degree as any other portion of the 

 bony frame of other animals which is articulated in a similar manner, its movea- 

 bility depending in a great degree on the length of the teeth of the joining surface, 

 in others the anterior portion is joined partly by ligament and partly by suture, 

 the posterior one by suture only, and therefore not so moveable as in other in- 

 stances. 



In young subjects this capacity for motion in the so-called valves of the 

 sternum is more apparent, but as they advance in age it gradually diminishes, 

 until in some the three pieces become, as it were, soldered together. In those 

 species where there are really two valves with ligamentous junctions, the box 

 of the shell can be entirely closed, and this connects them in some degree with 

 Cistudo, but this has the sternum joined to the shell by a membrane, whereas 

 in Kinosternum the same thing is effected by bony commissures from prolonga- 

 tions of the abdominal portion. 



The peculiarities of the sternum will allow the species of this genus to be ar- 

 ranged in three groups. 1st. Those in which it is truly bivalved, and closing 

 entirely the aperture of the cell. 2d. Those in which although the sternum is 

 wide, it by no means closes up the carapace, and is only furnished with an an- 

 terior valve joined to the abdominal portion, partly by ligament and partly by 

 suture, yet fully moveable as if the ligament was extended along the whole of 

 the hinder margin, the posterior valve united by a suture which admits of more 

 or less motion. 3d. The sternum with two joints, both of them completely 

 sutural. In these the different parts are frequently as immoveable as in an Emys. 



The following description of the genus Kinosternum is offered w r ith the hope 

 that it contains all the distinguishing characteristics possessed by the animals, 

 and that it will be sufficient to separate them from all others of the Testudinata. 



Kinosternum. Chin with from two to six papillae or warts. Vertebral scuta 

 more or less imbricate ; marginals twenty-three, sternal eleven in number. 

 Sternum composed of three separate pieces, of which the abdominal or interme- 

 diate one is immoveable, the anterior one turning on a partially or entirely liga- 

 mentous hinge, and the posterior articulated to the same piece either by a liga- 

 ment or by a suture, and consequently either freely and entirely moveable, or 

 only more or less imperfectly so. The wings which connect the sternum to the 




1854] 1S1 



shell are sometimes long and narrow, sometimes short and broad, but always 

 proceeding only from the abdominal piece. The shorter the wings the more 

 nearly can the shell be closed up by the sternum. The inguinal plate is long 

 and generally tolerably wide ; the axillary much smaller and narrowed anteriorly. 

 The feet are palmate, the fore feet with plicas or folds or transverse scales on 

 the outer side, the hind feet with as many on the inner side and a lew smaller 

 scales near the heel. The tail is sometimes furnished with papillae andsometimes 

 naked, often with a nail at the end and as often unarmed : this nail in no instance 

 being distinctive of sex. 



The species embraced in the last group would by some be considered as be- 

 longing to the genus Staurotypus. and by others to Steinothaerus, to neither of 

 which does it bear but a very slight resemblance. 



The sternum of Staurotyjjus is, as it were, cruciform and pointed before and 

 behind, the anterior portion consisting of but two plates, formed of the gular, the 

 brachial, and the pectoral united, and joined to the abdominal by a ligamentous 

 hinge, the two anal ones likewise being united into one so that the sternal scuta 

 are only seven in number. The whole contour of the animal reminds one of the 

 Emi/ia/cnts. As for the Sternothasrus it is exclusively an African genus, and is 

 remarkable for having no nuchal plate, and thirteen sternals, there being three 

 gnlars, those with the brachial and pectoral forming an anterior valve, which is 

 joined to the abdominal piece by a ligament, and of course is moveable, the rest 

 of the sternum is as fixed and immoveable as that of an Emys. The figure of an 

 animal of this genus in Dumeril's Herpetologie represents the wings as project- 

 ing from the pectoral and abdominal scuta, in which case the anterior portion of 

 the sternum would not be moveable. 



I shall now proceed to describe all the species of Kinosternum which I have 

 been nble to examine, giving minute details of those which I consider new, and 

 shorter or diagnostic descriptions of such as have been described before. 



Gro?rp 1st. Consisting of those with bivalved sterna, the valves joined to the 

 abdominal piece by ligamentous hinges. 



Kinosternum longicaudatum. Testa indistincte 3-carinata, elliptica, convexa, 

 dorso depressiusculo, postice retusa. margine angusto, nullo rnodo dispanso, 

 sterno cistam omnino occludente, postice profunde sed anguste emaruinato, scuto 

 vertebrali primo ad nuchale, marginale primum, et secundi partem anteriorem 

 appositum, vertebralipostremo solum ad marginale postremum. Cauda unguicu- 

 lata, ungue lato et obtuso. 



Habitat in America meridionali. Spix, Rept. Bras. p. 17, tab. xii. 



The carinae on the back of the shell are rather indistinct, and without doubt, 

 in older individuals, are not perceptible at all. This species is considered by 

 Dumeril as the Testndo scorpioidea of Linnaeus, which determination we shall 

 presently see is erroneous. 



K. scorpioi/les. Testa ovali modice convexa, dorso fortiter, lateribus naodice 

 carinata, margine declivi, scutis posterioribus vix latioribus. Sterno utrinque 

 rotundato, integerrimo. Cauda acute unguiculata. 



Hah. in America meridionali Surinami : unde a Dom Dr. Hering receptum. 



Head and neck grey, mottled and reticulate with black, upper jaw slightly 

 hooked. Shell oval, moderately convex, strongly carinate, on the vertebral 

 line, slightly so on each side, margin obliquely declivous except in the middle, 

 where it is perpendicular. First vertebral plate triangular, with the apex trun- 

 cate and the base angled; second, third and fourth hexagonal, with all the sides 

 nearly straight ; fifth triangular, with the outer posterior angle obliquely truncate, 

 and applied to the penultimate marginal, which is scarcely wider than that which 

 precedes it, in consequence of which the posterior lateral is nearly trapezoidal. 

 Margin acute all round, the plates oblong. Sternum elliptical, rounded at each 

 end, entire, not closing up the shell entirely; wings short, inguinal plate large, 

 scarcely narrowed anteriorly. Tail furnished with a sharp nail. 



Length 5.7, height l.G, width 4 inches, sternum 4.8 long. 



The above description appears to me to answer better to the Testudo scorpi- 

 oides than any other which I have seen. On account of the many varying 

 opinions concerning it, I have given a more detailed description than would 




182 



[October, 



otherwise have been necessary. The species is thus described in Gmelin's 

 edition of the Systema Naturae, vol. 1, p. 1041. T. scorpioides. Palmis ungui- 

 bus, 5 plantis 4, fronte callosa triloba, cauda unguiculata. Hab. Surinami. 



Testa nigra, ovali, oblon_;a, dorso quasi angulis 3 obsoletis, scutellis dorsi 

 figura clypeorum nobilium {heraldic shields). Caput anterius tectum callo, qui 

 posterius trilobus est, plantarum digitis externis muticis, ungues acuti, cauda 

 incurva. 



The indistinctness of the dorsal carinas makes me conclude that by the expres- 

 sion " quasi angulis tribus obsoletis " is meant their rather imperfect develop- 

 ment. I may not be right in this, for the description is scarcely sufficient to 

 decide the question. Were it not for the great respect every naturalist ought to 

 " feel for the great master, 



" Qui cunctos superat quod aut fuerunt 

 Aut sunt, aut aliis erunt in annis," 

 it would be as well to strike out of our books this name, as well as many others 

 scattered through his works. 



M. Dumeril considers the longicaudatum of Spix, as well as his brevieauda- 

 tum, synonymous with this species. The two above-mentioned species are very 

 different from each other, and have but a slight resemblance to the scorpioides. 

 An attentive perusal of the tedious and oratorical descriptions of the Brazilian 

 traveller shows this. 



K. Mexicanit7n. Testa ovali valde convexa fusro-lutescente vel nigricante ; 

 dorso fortiter tricarinato, margine undique declivi, scutis vertebralibus secundo,

Hab. Mexico; whence it was brought by Mr. Pease. Considered by Shaw 

 in his general zoology as a variety of K. Pennsylvavicum, vol. iii., p. 61, pi. 

 15. 



Head and neck above black, beneath yellow reticulately spotted with black, 

 jaws yellow, the upper one hooked and entire. Chin with four small warts, 

 only visible in young individuals. Fore legs above dusky, spotted on the ante- 

 rior side with yellow, beneath brown inclining to dusky, with four plica? or 

 large transverse scales on the upper side. Hind legs of the same color, with 

 four large and broad scales and numerous small ones near the heel. Tail short, 

 dusky, naked, with a rather sharp and long nail. Shell brownish dusky varied 

 with yellowish or altogether yellowish, the plate with a few indistinct, concen- 

 tric striae, which in young ones are more numerous and more distinct, and ac- 

 companied by others radiating from behind, regularly oval, very convex and 

 elevated, strongly tricarinate, so as to form two deep and wide channels on the 

 back : very declivous on the sides and on the margin all round. Vertebral 

 plates elongated and imbricate, the first triangular, with the apex truncate, and 

 the base somewhat angled, applied to the nuchal and first marginal only ; the 

 second, third, and fourth urceolate-hexagonal; the second and third emarginate 

 behind; the fourth with the anterior lateral faces twice as long as the posterior 

 lateral, and the posterior side bearing the same relation to the anterior; the fifth 

 heptagonal, the two anterior faces very long, the posterior lateral short and per- 

 pendicular to the two basal, which are straight ; in young specimens this plate 

 is simply triangular, with the apex truncate. The first lateral plate is unequally 

 triangular, the lower side curved, second and third very long, pentagonal, the 

 fourth quadrangular with the posterior base widely emarginate, so as to give the 

 figure another side, which thus becomes pentagonal. Nuchal plate small, wider 

 at base ; all the other plates oblong and four-sided, except the penultimate, which 

 is twice the height of the others, with its upper face rounded, so as to emargi- 

 nate the posterior basal angle of the last lateral, and is applied on the upper 

 half of its posterior side to the last vertebral, giving that plate its pentagonal 

 form. Sternum large, yellow, the sutures black : oval, entire, rounded at both 

 ends, the plates in young ones concentrically and radiatingly striate, entirely 

 closing up the box : gular plate large, triangular ; pectorals irregularly foursided, 

 the anterior face longer than the lateral; brachials triangular; abdominals 

 nearly square ; femorals triangular with the apex truncate, and the base rounded;

caudals right angled triangular ; wings very short ; inguinal plate long and 

 narrow, not joining the axillary. 



Length 4.4, breadth 3.0, height 2.3, sternum length 4.2, tail 1.4.

 spot behind the eye, somewhat varied with black. Jaws yellow, upper one very 

 slightly hooked. Chin with four small warts. Legs above dusky, beneath pale 

 brown ; fore legs with two folds on the upper side ; hind legs beneath squamose 

 with four folds. Tail very short, unarmed. Shell brown, regularly oval, very 

 convex and elevated, without any carina, very declivous on the sides and behind, 

 the lateral margin perpendicular, the posterior expanded. Vertebral plates im- 

 bricate ; the first triangular with the apex truncate, applied to the nuchal the 

 first marginal and half the second ; second, third, and fourth urceolate ; the 

 second and third hexagonal; the fourth four-sided, the anterior side one-third the 

 length of the base, which is rounded; the fifth triangular, the apex broadly trun- 

 cate, the base angled, and applied only to the last marginal. First lateral une- 

 qually four-sided, the base rounded, with four facets, second and third pentagonal, 

 fourth four-sided, the posterior basal angle deeply and roundly emarginate by 

 the penultimate marginal. Nuchal plate small, linear, all the other marginals 

 oblong and four-sided, those on the sides perpendicular, the four last on each 

 side wider and expanded, the penultimate one being higher than all the rest, and 

 rounded on the upper side. Sternum yellow, varied with dark brown, with nu- 

 merous diverging striae on the hinder plates, and concentric ones on the anterior, 

 rounded at both ends and a little emarginate behind ; bivalved, entirely closing 

 the box. Gular plate small, triangular, nearly equilateral ; pectorals irregularly 

 four-sided, the anterior face very short ; brachials four-sided, the interior side 

 half the length of the exterior ; abdominals exactly quadrate, wings short, axil- 

 lary scutum long and narrow, joining by a point to the inguinal, which is likewise 

 very long but much wider ; femorals four-sided, the interior side one-third the 

 length of the exterior ; caudals right angled triangular, with the base rounded.

Hah. In the northern part of the province of Sonora. 



Skin black, head and neck large, above mottled and spotted with whitish, be- 

 neath whitish, varied in the same manner with dusky; jaws horn-color, varied 

 with black, the upper jaw hooked and emarginate ; irids dark brown ; chin with 

 two tolerably large warts on the fore part. Fore legs above greyish dusky, with 

 three plica? or large scales; feet beneath scaly ? hind legs with three large scales 

 near the heel ; hind part with two large patches of rounded echinate scales. 

 Tail sulcate beneath, with a large and strong, rather blunt nail, and six rows of 

 small upright pointed papillae, and a few smaller ones round the anus. Shell 

 cinereous brown, with some very faint radiating marks of darker, and some 

 indistinct concentric striae on the plates : it is elongated oval, a little widened 

 behind, moderately convex, declivous both before and behind, the anterior and 

 posterior margin expanded, the middle declivous ; very slightly tricarinate on the 

 back, the intermediate carina more apparent, particularly before and behind, 

 the lateral ones obsolete and scarcely to be traced except on the two last lateral 

 plates. Vertebral plates imbricate, the first triangular, with its apex truncate, 

 its base straight and applied only to the first marginal, second, third and fourth 

 urceolate hexagonal, the second longer than either of the two others, the fifth 

 heptagonal, the upper face short subtridentate, the anterior lateral one much 

 longer than the others, the posterior lateral short and perpendicular to the basal, 

 which are a little curved, first lateral unequally quadrilateral, the lower side 

 curved and with four facets, second and third transverse, pentagon?], fourth 

 quadrangular, the posterior lateral angle widely and deeply emarginate so as to 

 give to the figure another curved side, by which it becomes pentagonal : margin 

 narrow, expanded in front, declivous in the middle, the three last plates expanded 

 and the caudal one again declivous, nuchal plate oblong four-sided, the second a 

 little wider than the first, third and fourth, the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and 

 ninth are wider and somewhat angled on the upper face; all these are oblong, the 

 tenth or penultimate is wider than any, its upper face is rounded and deeply and 

 widely emarginates the posterior basal angle of the fourth lateral, and is applied 

 on the upper part of its posterior face to the last vertebral, giving to lhat plate 

 its pentagonal form. Sternum jointed before by a ligament and behind by a suture, 

 not entirely closing the box of the shell ; before bluntly rounded, behind emar- 

 ginate, the plates concentrically striate, gular plate large, equilaterally triangular, 

 the base rounded, pectorals oblong quadrangular, outer side a little wider than 

 the inner and curved, the two exterior angles right, the lower one projecting a 

 little beyond the brachials, the anterior interior angle very obtuse, the remain- 

 ing one very acute ; brachials triangular, the apex blunt ; abdominals quad- 

 rangular, the outer side a little curved ; femorals quadrangular, the inner side 

 much shorter than the outer, posterior side oblique, outer side curved, the ante- 

 rior straight, the posterior exterior angle projecting a little beyond the caudals 

 which are right-angled triangular with the base rounded. 



Length 4.4, breadth 2.1, height 1.3 : sternum length, 3.7- tail 1.4. 

 This species, which has the shell much less elevated than any other which I 

 have seen, appears to be intermediate between this group and the next, so much 

 so, that I long hesitated where to place it. The points of resemblance, however, 

 whieh it had in common with the pennsylvanicum being more numerous than 

 those which belong to the orforatum, led me at last to arrange it with the former. 

 I may have been wrong in doing this, but if so, there is not much harm done. 

 The K. sonoriense was brought by my son along with many other interesting 

 animals from Tucson in Sonora; there can be but little doubt of its being found 

 likewise in California. 



Group III. Sternum narrow, subcruciform, valves joined to the abdominal 

 portion of the chest by sutures, the lateral teeth of which are so large as to 

 admit of but little motion, especially in the posterior one; wings long and narrow 

 without any groove on the inner part, tail unarmed.

It is remarkable how this species has been shifted from one genus to another, 

 until it may be found arranged under six different genera, and divided into four 

 species. It does vary considerably as regards the mobility of the sternum, and 

 the form of the dorsal pottion of the shell, which although generally carinate is 

 sometimes perfectly flat in the middle; specimens in all respects intermediate 

 may be found. The anterior valve of the sternum cannot be moved more than 

 so as to form an angle of 20 with the abdominal line, the posterior much 

 less.

Besides these, there are four species described by others which I have never 

 seen, namely, K. hirtipes Wagler. descript. et icones. tab 630. K. brevicau da- 

 tum Spix. Rept. Braz. p. IS, tab. xiii. K. cruentatnm Cat. Mus. Jardin des 

 plantes, and K. Doubledayii Gray, Cat. Brit. Mus. 



In the imperfect monograph of the Tortoises of the United States, published 

 in the Annals of the Lyceum of Natural History of New York for the year 1829, 

 I complained that no arrangement of these animals had yet been offered to the 

 world which I could consent to adopt. This defect has not yet been remedied, 

 nor since then have the various suggestions offered by different naturalists been 

 at all satisfactory. Every scheme for the arrangement into families and groups, 

 has evidently not been founded on natural and philosophical principles. Most 

 writers on Herpetology appear to have devoted their time, not to the dis- 

 covery of the affinities of the objects they were describing, but to changing the 

 names of the genera and the species, and to making sppcies out of the slightest 

 varieties; thus clogging the science with useless and absurd synonyms. 



The simplicity of my arrangement, which divides the whole order into four 

 great families, and-these again, when necessary, into groups, will 1 hope recom- 

 mend it to notice. I owe this arrangement, in a great degree, to the suggestions 

 of my son.

I add a list of American species of Testudinata, as far as they have yet been 

 described; many undoubtedly yet remain to be added to it, as few have been 

 received from Texas, California and Oregon. I have omitted the sea tortoises 

 because we know nothing about such as are found on our coasts. All the 

 synonyms which 1 have been able to collect are here set down. This will serve 

 to show the state in which the science of this branch of Herpetology is at present. 

 as tar as relates to our country. 



I have in the following Catalogue considered the Testudo polyphemus as the 

 T. Carolina of Linnaeus and Gmelin, and the T. Carolina of authors as the T. 

 clausa of the latter. My reasons are these : The original description in the 

 12th edition of the Syst. Naturae, vol. i. p. 352, is as follows : 



Testudo Carolina. Pedibus subdigitatis, testa gibba, cauda nulla. Test, 

 pedibus digitatis, calloso-squammosis ; testa ovali, subconvexa, scutellis planis, 

 striatis, medio punctatis. Gron. Zooph. 17, No. 77. T. tessellata minor caro- 

 liniana. Edw. Av. tab. 205, (undoubtedly the Clausa ;) Seba. Mus. 1 tab. 80 figs. 

 Test, major terrestris americana, (which is represented as 9 inches long.) 



To this Gmelin adds : Caput subobtusum, squammis obtusis undique tectum. 

 Pedes squammis orbicularis obtecti, antice unguibus 5 postice 4 subulatis, acu- 

 minatis validis armati. Cauda brevissima. Scutum ovale, subconvexum antice 

 lunulato-excisum margines acuti nee serrati. Scutella lata ad margines striis 

 cincta, centro punctis excavata. Sternum acuminato-truncatum postice bifidum. 

 Erasing the words in italics, this is a tolerable description of the large American 

 land tortoise, and Gmelin certainly had it in view when he made his addition to 

 the original description. His expression, "Sternum antice truncatum postice 

 bifidum," together with the scaly head, prove this. The scuta of young animals 

 of this species are deeply marked with concentric striae, and have a nearly 

 square area in the centre of each, which is deeply and coarsely punctate. The 

 name of Polyphemus which has been given to it, means nothing; that of Carolina 

 is much more fitting; and as for the other species which has been called Caro- 

 lina, nothing can be more appropriate than Clausa. 



It will be observed likewise that I have called the Cistudo Blandingii of Hol- 

 brook, Lutretnys meleagns. About the generic name there can be no dispute; 

 but as for the specific name, my reasons for referring it to a species already 

 described are these. The Testudo meleagris of Shaw, Naturalist's Miscpllany, 

 vol. iv. p. 144, has been considered as identical w r ith the Lutremys Europoea, 

 and is always quoted as a synonym of it. Shaw tells us that his animal came 

 from America; the other is, I believe, exclusively European. Both species are 

 remarkable for having the shell more or less covered with small yellow spots; 

 in the first these are irregularly scattered over the surface, in the latter they 

 regularly radiate from a centre on each scutum ; the shell is also less convex.

In the Catalogue of Amphibia in the collection of the British Museum, and in 

 that of the Jardin des Plantes, the following species of tortoises are mentioned 

 as coming from the United States. In the English Catalogue are described 

 Emys rivulata, E. scripta, E. Holbrookii, E. macrocephala, and E. Bennetii. 

 Not having these, and knowing that the descriptions must have been taken from 

 dried and faded specimens, or from such as were bleached by long immersion in 




190 [October, 



alcohol, 1 do not hesitate to pronounce them as having no real existence as 

 distinct species, or at most as being slight variations from others well known 

 and long ago determined. 



The Kinosternum Doubledayii, however, forms an exception. Tt appears to he 

 certainly a new and hitherto undescribed animal, although what Mr. Gray says of 

 it is scarcely sufficient to distinguish it. M. Dumeril's E. labyrinthica seems 

 to be nothing more than E. hieroglyphica of Holbrook, slightly varying in the 

 disposition of the marks and lines on the shell ; his Kinosternum cruentatum 

 is probably not from this country; it is a well marked and distinct species. 



The following species, retained in most of our books, ought to be struck out. 

 In Schcepff, Testudo tricarinata, a young animal of some Kinosternum; T. 

 cinerea, a young picta; T. scripta, a young serrata or reticulata; T. rostiata, a 

 young Trionyx. And from Linnaeus, Syst. Nat., T. membranacea, which is 

 likewise a young Trionyx ; T. scabra, the description has been made from an 

 immature specimen, which, if full grown, might have been smooth ; T. carinata ; 

 T. sulcata; and, finally, T. squamosa, which is not a Chelonian. 



Observations on the Vespertilio leporinus of Linnaeus. 

 By John Le Conte. 



Our associate Dr. Woodhouse, some time ago gave me for examination a 

 species of Bat found by him in the province of Honduras, which is undoubtedly 

 the Noctilio dorsatus of Geoffroy de St. Hilaire, the Vespertilio leporinus of 

 Linnaeus, i. p. 47, although the description of " the illustrious Swede " is rather 

 short and imperfect. Schreber vol. i. p. 163 tab. 60 describes and figures it as 

 a Noctilio retaining the Linnean specific name. Wagner, in his supplement to 

 the work of this last author vol. 1 p. 451, calls it N. dorsatus and considers it 

 the same as the albiventris of Spix. Sim. et Ves. Brazil tab. xxxv. fig. 2 and 

 3, and the N. affinis of D'Orbigny Voy. vol. iv. p. 42 p. 12. The N. unicolor 

 of Wagner is probably the same. Indeed the author observes, that it only differs 

 in color from the other species which he describes ; which is a matter of very 

 little consequence in any of the Vespertilionidse. Every species of this family 

 is so variable in this respect as to forbid its being taken as a criterion of differ- 

 ence. There will therefore be but one species of this genus, and for the name of 

 this we must revert to Linnaeus and resume the old name of leporinus, although 

 this appellation was founded in error, the upper lip not being cleft, but in recent 

 specimens covering the incisors. In dried animals it shrinks and becomes drawn 

 up in such a manner as to leave the upper fore teeth exposed, and to represent a 

 very bad case of hare lip. 



The animal from which the following description was taken, was in its most 

 perfect state of development ; at that period of its life when it would be called 

 neither young nor old. It certainly had but tw r o upper incisors nor was there 

 any appearance of there ever having been any others ; in their shape they re- 

 semble canines, and like them are furnished with an interior lobed calcaneum. 

 The lower incisors are deeply emarginate and may in some instances be taken 

 for four distinct teeth. 



The upper fore teeth of Cheiropters offer a very interesting subject for inves- 

 tigation, whether what are so-called are in reality incisors, or not more properly 

 canines. It is now generally allowed that no teeth ought to be called incisors 

 unless they spring from the intermaxillary bone; now whether in those animals 

 where there is no nasal bone and the front of the upper jaw is excavated, and this 

 excavation reaching to the end of the os frontis, they can be said to have any 

 os intermaxillare, I have not been able to determine. In the frugivorous bats 

 which have regular incisors in the upper jaw, the cranium entirely wants this 

 frontal excavation, and is furnished with nasal bones in as much perfection as 

 any other mammal. The determination of this point must be left to others ; it 

 is sufficient that I have hinted at the circumstance. It appears to me that some 

 species of Taphizous may belong to this genus ; not however having specimens 

 to compare I cannot pronounce positively. The generic essence of our animal, 




1854.] 191 



exclusive of the teeth is the peculiar form of the alar membrane, which on the 

 sides extends only to the middle of the tibia, and in the tail being shorter than 

 the interfemoral membrane and in having its extremity free by passing through 

 it near the middle. 



There are very good representations of this animal in Schreber and in D'Or- 

 bigny. The figure in Seba vol. i. pi. Iv. fig. 1, referred to by authors, has nothing 

 to do with it. 



In order to remove any difficulty which may hereafter occur in the determina- 

 tion of this species I add a detailed description, observins that very little reliance 

 ought 1o be placed on the color. 



Noctilio le-porimis. Linn. Syst. Nat. i. p. 47, Noctilio dorsatus Geoffroy de 

 St. Hilaire and Wagner, N. albiventris Spix, N. affinis D'Orbigny, N. unicolor 

 Wagner. 



Fur short and soft fulvous a little paler beneath, back with a very conspicuous 

 narrow stripe of a paler and yellowish color from the base of the head to the 

 root of the tail. The hair of the back occupies a triangular space the base of 

 which lies between the shoulders and the apex reaches to the tail, leaving the 

 sides naked. Beneath the whole body is covered with hair. Face black: nose 

 broad, flat, emarginate, sulcate on the top ; nostrils somewhat tubular and pro- 

 jecting; upper lip tumid confluent with the nostrils, hanging down and its de- 

 pendant sides so placed as to form a wide excavation below the part which 

 covers the incisors ; it is not however cleft nor resembling a hare lip (unless it be 

 shrunk and contracted upwards by the drying of the parts) lower lip very tumid, 

 three lobed the lateral lobes recurved and crenate on their edge. Chin with a 

 small semicircular appendage and four folds diverging from it. Cheeks with 

 four small warts, each furnished with two bristles. Ears rather long, oval, blunt 

 pointed, outer edge with four or five transverse plica? the lower part with an up- 

 right rounded lobe ; tragus small with a small branch on the inner side and four 

 blunt teeth on the outer. Membrane thin, black, naked, not reaching as in most 

 other bats to the carpus of the hind feet but ending about the middle of the tibia, 

 on the under side it is whitish for a considerable space near the body, around the 

 tail and along the hind legs: at the thumb, on the under side of the membrane on 

 each side of the innermost figure is a small pouch or cavity formed by a narrow 

 appendage or supplementary portion of the membrane which proceeds from the 

 joint and runs down the wing for a short distance. Interfemoral membrane in- 

 cluding the tail, broad rounded at the end with a small tooth on each side about 

 one quarter of the distance from the middle. Tail not half as long as the inter- 

 femoral and projecting from the middle of the membrane for about one fifth of 

 its length. Hind legs stout, feet very long toes with parallel claws very long 

 and very much hooked calcaneum bordering the membrane for the greater part 

 of its length. 



Length of head and body 4 inches, head 1.2, extent 22.7, length of interfemoral 

 2 inches, tail 1.0, naked portion 2.0, foot 1.1, nail 35. 



On TJrnatella gracilis and a new species of Plumatella. 

 By Joseph Leidy, M. D. 



In the Proceedings for November 1851, (page 321), I published the description 

 of what I then suspected to be the coencecium of a new genus and species of 

 fresh water bryozoid polyps, to which I gave the name of JJmatella gracilis. 

 Since then I have examined this body and find my suspicion was correct ; and 

 TJrnatella proves to be the most beautiful of the fresh water polyzoa which has 

 yet been discovered. I have made drawings of the species, and propose hereafter 

 to give a full description of it; and at present will simply give its diagnosis. 



TJrnatella, Leidy. 



Cancecium consisting of a series of segments up to eighteen in number, and 

 forming free, semi-erect, curved stems, attached only by the base of the lowest 

 segment. Segments, excepting the three last ones, simple, urniform ; the ante- 

 penultimate and the penultimate oblong, with simple or compound branches of 




192 [October, 



the same form ; the last segment or active polyp is campanulate and is supplied 

 with cylindrical, ciliated arms arranged in a circle around the mouth. 



Urnatella gracilis, Leidy. 



Stems single, or in groups up to six in number, attached at the lower ex- 

 tremity by means of a sienna colored granular substance. Urniform segments 

 .225 m.m. long by .18 m.m. broad, becoming smaller towards the free end of 

 the stems ; body portion of each urniform segment translucent whitish, with 

 sienna colored transverse striae and punetae, and having on each side near the 

 bottom a rounded process, the remains of former branches ; the narrow top and 

 bottom portion of the segments brown in color and annulated. The antepenul- 

 timate and penultimate segments and their branches oblong, translucent. Polyp 

 .225 to .45 m.m. long, campanulate ; expanded mouth circular, the diameter 

 equal to the length of the body, surrounded by fourteen cylindrical, ciliated, re- 

 tractile arms. Stems up to 4 m.m. in length. 



Habitation. On the underside of stones in the river Schuylkill below low 

 water, in Philadelphia city. 



Plumatella vesicularis, Leidy. 



Ccencecium radiating and branching, attached, colorless and transparent; each 

 segment slightly dilated and much broader than the protuberant orifices of exit. 

 Length of the segments about 1. m.m., breadth 1 m.m. Animal colorless. Ova 

 oval lenticular, (with an annulus but without spines.) 



Habitation. Found in the Schuylkill river with the preceding, on the under 

 side of flat stones. 



Remarks. This species of Plumatella is as limpid as the water in which it 

 lives ; and it resembles rows of colorless vesicles with a whitish line passing 

 through their axis. Frequently it is observed with rows of imbricated blackish 

 eggs instead of the latter line. Patches are found from a quarter of an inch to 

 two inches square.

color slate or grayish above, with transverse, brown, lozenge-like bands, their 

 external margins extending to the abdomen with intermediate yellow spots and 

 yellowish markings enclosed within the brown, sometimes two in number; the 

 brown lozenge-like spots become indistinct posteriorly and contain no yellowish

 gated and distinct ; scales elongate, keeled at the tip. (Gray.) 



Echis squamigera, nob. 



Sp. char. Rostral plate much more extended in the transverse direction than 

 vertically; eleven distinct plates along the margin of the upper jaw, of which 

 the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th are the largest ; the inferior margin of the eye opposite 

 to the 4th, 5th and 6th ; eye surrounded with scales, of which the two anterior 

 are the largest, and of nearly equal size ; anterior geneials much narrower than 

 the posterior ; neck contracted ; body slender, compressed, thicker in the mid- 

 dle, with 18 rows of lanceolate and strongly carinated scales; the lateral and in- 

 ferior rows do not differ in size from the rest, and are also carinated ; tail short

Gen. obs. This is evidently not the Echis pavo, or Echis varia of Reuss, Mus. 

 Senkenberg., band 1, p. 157, 160. It has a certain resemblance to the figure of 

 the Vipera pyramidarum, Descript. de PEgypte, t.7, fig. 1, but the scales upon 

 the head in that figure are represented as all of the same size, and the markings 

 upon the body are not the same. It has no resemblance to the Horatta Pam of 

 Russell, Indian Serpents fig. 11. It is well characterized by the larger scales 

 upon the vertex. But two species of Echis have been heretofore described. 



Fam. HYLAD.E. 



Hyla punctata, nob.

Characteristics of some Cartilaginous Fishes of the Pacific coast of North 



America. 



By Charles Girartj. 



1. Cestracjon francisci, G. The largest of these specimens now before us, 

 and measuring nearly two feet, bears a very strong resemblance to C. Phillippiy 

 though of a somewhat more bulky appearance. The bony ridge, above the eye, 

 is much more developed, and the fins are larger also. The posterior margin 

 of the caudal is bilobed instead of being rounded : an emareination correspond- 

 ing to the top of the vertebral column. The anal is placed farther back ; its tip 

 projecting beyond the anterior margin of the inferior lobe of the caudal. The 

 posterior extremity of the ventrals extends beyond the anterior margin of the 

 second dorsal. Color, above yellowish grey, darker in the young; beneath light 

 yellow. Small roundish black spots are spread all over the body and fins. 



Collected by Lt. W. P. Trowbridge, U. S. A., in the Bay of Monterey, Cal. 



2. Triakis semifasciatum, G. This species is closely allied to T. scyllhim, 

 from which it differs by a more backward position of the mouth or else a more 

 developed snout. The chagrin which covers the surface of the skin is more * 

 acute, giving to the fish a more prickly aspect. Color above olivaceous grey, 

 lighter beneath ; yellowish under the head and throat. Dorsal region marked 

 by transverse bands of deep black, with spots of the same hue between the bands, 

 and also beneath them, along the sides of the body. A black spot exists at the 

 base and upper surface of the ventrals and pectorals. The caudal is spotted all 

 over, whilst the dorsals and anal are so only at their base. 



Specimens were collected near Presidio, in the Bay of San Francisco, Cal., by 

 Lt. W. P. Trowbridge, U. S. A. 



3. Spinax (Acanthias) suckleyi, G. Specimens about twenty nine inches 

 long. Snout very much flattened, elongated, and subconical in its outline when 

 viewed from above. Eyes very large, elongated and placed immediately in ad- 

 vance of the mouth. Five branchial apertures well developed. Mouth large. 

 Dorsal fins moderate ; spine of anterior dorsal rather small. Pectorals very 

 large and expanded, concave upon their posterior margin. External margin of 

 ventrals rounded. Inferior lobe of caudal deeply emarginated ; upper lobe long 

 and lanceolated. Color above of a dark grey with a few small whitish spots; 

 beneath, under the head and belly, dull yellowish ; farther back, of a light 

 greyish hue. 



Collected at Fort Steilacoom, Puget Sound, W. T., by Dr. Geo. Suckley, 

 U. S. A. 



4. Rhinobattjs producta, Ayres, in Proc Cal. Acad. Sc. I. 1854. A male 

 specimen, thirty eight inches in total length, brought this species to our know- 

 ledge. The rostral distance, from the eyes forwards, is of a much lighter hue 

 than the* rest of the body. A blackish band exists along the middle of the back, 

 with diffused blotches upon the sides, and a double band of the same color along 

 the middle of the snout. 



Collected either at Presidio or Monterey, Cal., by Lt. W. P. Trowbridge, 

 U. S. A. 



5. Raja binoculata, G. Transverse diameter, from tip of one pectoral fin 

 to the other, greater than the longitudinal, from tip of snout to the extremities 

 of the ventrals. Snout tapering and rounded anteriorly. Eyes moderate ; orbit 

 surrounded with spines. A spine upon the dorsal line, near the origin of the 

 trunk. Tail longer than the body and head together, slender and flattened most 

 of its length ; provided above with a series of spines extending from its origin 

 to the base of the first dorsal fin. Second dorsal within a short space of the first 

 and approximating the tip of the tail. Ground color olivaceous brown ; snout 

 dull whitish. A large subcircular black ring at the base of pectorals enclosing 

 a large subcircular black spot. At a short distance behind these may be seen a 

 much smaller and more obsolete subcircular dark ring, clouded within with 




1854.] 197 



blackish. Beneath dull yellowish ; external margin of ventrals blackish. Dor- 

 sal fins olivaceous; extremity of caudal blackish with a lighter margin. 



Collected by Dr. A. L. Heermann,at San Francisco, Cal., while attached to the 

 Pacific Railroad Survey under Lt. R. S. Williamson, XL S. A.

PERC1D.E. 



Genus PERCICHTHYS, Girard. 



Body oblong or elongated, compressed, covered with scales of medium develop- 

 ment, finely ciliated upon their posterior margin. Snout rather thick and blunt, 

 overlapping slightly the lower jaw ; card-like teeth on the jaws ; velvet-like 

 teeth disposed upon a transverse band in front of the vomer, and upon a narrow 

 band along the palatines, sometimes only towaids the anterior extremity of these 

 latter bones. Tongue smooth. Upper surface of head, suborbitals and posterior 

 dilatation of the upper maxillary, covered with scales as well as the cheeks and 

 opercular apparatus. Suborbital and preopercle serrated. Opercle provided 

 with a spine. Branchiostegals six or seven in number. Two dorsal fins conti- 

 guous at their base. Insertion of ventral fins immediately beneath the base of 

 pectorals. Anal fin provided with three spiny rays.

ATHERTNIDiE. 



This family heretofore composed of the single genus Atherina, having been 

 made on our part the subject of much research, is now understood by us in the 

 following manner. The 



Genus ATHERINOPSIS, Girard, 



Which we have recently established, is to receive such species as have no 

 palatine teeth, with both jaws equal, and the snout more or less rounded. 



Atherina menidia, Linn., and A. notata, Mitch., will come under this denom- 

 ination, alongside with A* calif omiensis, Girard. The 



Genus BASILICHTHYS, Girard, 



is characterised by the protrusion of the upper jaw beyond the lower; adding 

 to that feature small teeth on both jaws, none on either the vomer or palatines, 

 the intermaxitlaries constituting the upper arcade of the mouth, with the maxil- 

 laries placed behind them, and the upper surface of the head scaly ; including :

 A. macrophthalma, Agass. ; A. bonariensis, Cuv. & Val. and A. lichtensteinii, 

 Cuv. & Val. Finally the 



Genus HETEROGNATHUS, Girard, 



Is based upon the elongation of the lower jaw which projects considerably 

 beyond tbe upper one. There are either no teeth on the palate or else they exist 

 in a very rudimentary state only. 



Atherina humboldtiana, Cuv. & Vax.., and A. vomerina, Cuv. & Val., will, 

 for the present, constitute this genus.

Notice of some Fossil Bones discovered by Mr. Francis Am Lincle, in the banks 



of the Ohio River, Indiana. 



By Joseph Leidy, M.D. 



Through the kindness of my friend, Dr. J. G. Norwood, of New Harmony, 

 Indiana, I have had the opportunity of examining a collection of fossil bones,, 

 which were obtained by Mr. Francis A. Lincke, from the banks of the Ohio 

 River, near the mouth of Pigeon Creek, a short distance below Evansville, 

 Indiana. The bones are usually found in this locality sticking in the bank, 

 when the w r ater in the river is low. 



The specimens are thoroughly impregnated with oxide of iron, which also 

 erves as a cement to adhering pebbles, sand, fragments of Unios, and shells of 

 s he species of JSlelania canaliculata, Pahi.dina- 2>onderosa i etc. 




200 



[November,, 



The collection contains bones of the following animals : 



Megalonyx Jeffersonii, Harlan. 



a. Two tibial diaphyses of the left side of young individuals. 

 h. A vertebra dentata. 



c. A. fragment of an os calcis. 



d. A metacarpal and a metatarsal bone. 



e. An ungual phalanx. 



Bison Americanus? (fossilis).* 



a. A fragment of a cervical vertebra. 



Cervus Virginianus (fossilis). 



a. Proximal half of a tibia. 



b. Distal half of a tibia. 



e. Proximal half of a metacarpal bone. 



d. Proximal and distal halves of two metatarsal bones. 



e. Portions of two scapula?. 



/. Proximal portion of a first rib. 



g. The mutilated cranium of a doe. 



h. The superior portion of the cranium of a buck ; the antlers having been 

 shed. 



i. Three portions of as many lower jaws of different ages. One contains the 

 back five molars very much worn away ; a second contains the last two molars 

 a little worn; and the third contains all the molars, but the last temporary one 

 has not been shed, nor is the last true one protruded. All these specimens cor- 

 respond in size with the same parts of large individuals of the existing Certnis 

 virginianus, and have the same form ; and they probably belonged to the same 

 species. Besides these specimens, fossil bones of a deer not larger than the 

 Cervus virginianus have been found in association with bones of the Megalonyx, 

 Mastodon, &c, in the vicinity of Natchez, Mississippi. In the cabinet of the 

 Academy there are several specimens from this locality, consisting of a portion 

 of a lower jaw, a fragment of an antler, and the posterior and inferior portions 

 of two crania. 



Eqtjus Americanus, Leidy. 

 a. The last dorsal vertebra. 



Tapirus. 



a. An inferior back molar tooth of an old individual. The crown is much 

 worn and the fangs are long, spreading, and thickened. It is larger than in the 

 recent Tapir americanus, and belongs to the supposed extinct species which I 

 have designated as Tapirus Hay sit. 



Canis prim-Evus, Leidy. 



This name is proposed for a species of wolf, which I suppose to be indicated 

 by a specimen, in Mr. Lincke's collection, of a left upper maxillary bone con- 

 taining the posterior five molars, all of which are nearly entire except the 

 penultimate one. The fragment, however, only differs from the corresponding 

 part of the recent Canis lupus of Europe and its American congeners, in being 

 rather larger (about one sixth), and in its having slight variations in several of 

 the molar teeth. Certain naturalists may regard the fossil as an indication of a 

 variety only of the Canis lupus, and of the correctness of such a view I shall 

 not attempt to decide. Naturalists have not yet settled among themselves the 

 question of how far characters of a specific value may be obtained from the 

 skulls and teeth of many genera. Most naturalists regard the Canis lupus, of 

 Europe, and the Canis oceidentalis and many other wolves of America as of the 

 same species. Certainly they possess no important osteological differences, but 

 the same may be said of the grizzly bear, the polar bear, and the brown bear, or 

 of the horse, the ass, and the zebra, or of the lion, the tiger, and the panther, 

 etc., etc. Those who have attempted to define a species, I think, have gene-

rally given too much value to a mere convenient word, with which naturalists 

 empirically designate groups of organized beings possessing characters of com- 

 parative constancy, so far as historic experience has guided them in giving due 

 weight to such constancy. 



The question of the origin of species, whether from a single pair or from a 

 plural stock, whether by ascent from the lowest form of life, in gradually di- 

 verging series, or whether through innumerable miraculous interpositions, 1 

 think is entirely independent of the former question. 



To return to the fossil ; the maxilla has the same form externally as in the 

 corresponding bone of the recent wolves with which I have compared it. The 

 infra-orbital foramen is on a line vertical to the interval between the third and 

 fourth molar teeth, which is slightly farther back than in any of the skulls of 

 recent wolves examined. 



The penultimate molar is less concave posteriorly than in our recent speci- 

 mens ; and its antero-posterior diameter internally is greater in relation to the 

 same diameter externally ; in other words, the tooth internally is less narrowed 

 than in recent wolves. It is also broader in the antero-posterior diameter when 

 compared with its transverse diameter. Its basal ridge externally is more 

 abrupt and is slightly mammillated at its border. The second and third molars 

 have their basal ridge internally more developed, which is also the case with the 

 internal oblique ridge descending towards the cusp anteriorly. 



The principal measurements of the fossil, in comparison with those of the 

 corresponding part in recent wolves are as follows :

Dr. Wetherill presented a paper for publication, entitled " Chemical 

 Notices.'' Referred to Dr. Rand, Dr. Bridges, and Dr. Genth. 



Dr. Wetherill called the attention of the members to the experiments 

 of Dr. Stenhouse upon the action of charcoal on animal substances in 

 promoting their rapid destruction, a fact first noticed by Mr. Turnbull, 

 of London. In the experiments of Dr. Stenhouse, small animals were 

 covered with powdered charcoal, and the soft parts were speedily de- 

 stroyed. No offensive odor was noticed, although the experiments were 

 conducted in the laboratory. Dr. Wetherill suggested the use of this 

 agent in the preparations of the skeletons of small animals. 



Mr. Cassin stated that at the present time, and for several weeks past, 

 the white-winged Crossbill (Loxia leucoptera) has been exceedingly 

 abundant in the neighborhood of this city, and noticed the fact that this 

 had been the case, notwithstanding that the weather had not been more 

 rigorous than usual at this season. This bird has not appeared here 

 until the present month, since the winter of 183G-7, when it and other 




204 [December, 



northern birds were very abundant. As yet, the bird alluded to has 

 not been ascertained to be accompanied by other species, but is more 

 abundant than during its visit in 1836-7. During an excursion in New 

 Jersey, a few miles from Philadelphia, Mr. C. stated that he saw not 

 only boys shooting crossbills in large numbers, but killing them with 

 stones, which their frequenting low pine trees, and their apparent entire 

 want of acquaintance with danger, rendered not difficult. They, in fact, 

 manifest the utmost simplicity of habits, showing even no signs of alarm 

 at the report of the gun, and continue quietly searching for food without 

 regarding the death of their companions. 



A collector of this city recently shot seventy-eight specimens in the 

 course of one morning, and Mr. Drexler, lately employed by the Academy 

 as taxidermist, shot twenty-seven specimens this day. It would appear 

 from the unsuspicious manners of these birds that they have migrated 

 from regions not settled by the white races of men, and their appearance 

 here in such large numbers may be considered as demonstrative that the 

 winter in the north either commenced unusually early, thus preventing 

 the maturity of the buds on which they subsist, or that it has been of 

 great severity.

An Abstract of Experiments upon the Physical Influences exerted by hiving 

 Organic* and Inorganic , Membranes, upon Chemical Substances passing through 

 than by Endosmose. 



By Joseph Jones. 



The phenomenon of endosmose is coeval with that of life. All organized 

 beings spring from organic cells. Each cell is a chemical laboratory ; the mate- 

 rials for its nutrition, growth, and elaboration all pass through its walls by en- 

 dosmose. What is true of the organic cell, is also true of every living organ- 

 ism, however simple or complex, because all its acts of nutrition, secretion, and 

 growth, are carried on by organic cells. These facts show the important bear- 

 ing of endosmose upon physiology and pathology, and demonstrate the absolute 

 necessity of studying and understanding its phenomena, and developing, as far 

 as possible, all its physical laws. 



A true knowledge of these can only be gained by careful, laborious, and nu- 

 merous experiments. 



Experiments upon Living Animals, shoioing that their Membranes exert a 

 Physical Influence capable of changing the molecular arrangement of Chemi- 

 cal Substances in solution, passing through them by Endosmose. 

 Immersed the belly and lower extremities of a large spring-frog, in a strong 

 solution of the chloride of calcium, and allowed it to remain for an hour ; then 

 washing it carefully with water, immersed its lower extremities in a strong so- 

 lution of the oxalate of ammonia. It remained in this solution for one hour, 




1854.] 205 



when it was again carefully washed and placed in the solution of the chloride of 

 calcium, where it remained for a similar length of time. Finally, it was re- 

 moved from this, back to the solution of the oxalate of ammonia. 



During the course of the experiment, which lasted four hours, the frog gradu- 

 ally became weaker and more inactive, and finally died in the solution of the 

 oxalate of ammonia in which it was last placed. The specific gravity of the 

 solution of the oxalate of ammonia was much less than that of the chloride of 

 calcium, consequently the object in moving the frog from one solution to 

 another, was to obtain as large a deposite of the oxalate of lime within its 

 blood-vessels and tissues as possible, by promoting the actions of imbibition, 

 endosmose, and exosmose. 



As a general rule, the rapidity of the action of endosmose is proportional to 

 the difference of the densities of the exterior and interior fluids. The effects of 

 this action, or rather of the membranes, upon the chemical substances passing 

 through, will be manifested by the change of physical form exhibited by the 

 precipitate of the oxalate of lime. 



Immediately after the frog had been removed from the solution of the oxalate 

 of ammonia, an incision was made below and to the side of its sternum, into the 

 cavity of the thorax and abdomen. The heart was found still pulsating. The 

 blood-vessels beneath the skin, upon the surface of the stomach and intes- 

 tines, in the muscular fold of the peritonoeum, and between the kidneys, ap- 

 peared thoroughly injected with blood, as if the animal had died of violent in- 

 flammation of all these parts. 



The blood from the heart and lungs was first examined under the microscope, 

 in which, with a magnifying power of 210 diameters, were seen innumerable 

 minute cubical particles, floating amongst the large elliptical blood capsules. In 

 the fibrous tissue between the epidermis and pectoralis major muscle, square 

 plates, cubical crystals, and parallelograms were seen, together with minute 

 particles, the largest of which appeared to be cubes. 



The mesenteric fold of the peritonoeum contained the same equi-lateral, equi- 

 angular plates, and cubical crystals. In the fascia of the thigh, besides numbers 

 of these, there appeared, also, beautiful octohedral crystals of the oxalate of 

 lime, similar in all respects to those formed when the intestines of a raccoon, 

 (Procyon lotor,) were filled with a solution of the chloride of calcium, and im- 

 mersed in a solution of the oxalate of ammonia. 



When the eggs of the frog were mashed, and their contents spread out on a 

 glass slide and examined under the microscope, they contained multitudes of 

 equi-angular plates, aud cubical crystals of the oxalate of lime. 



It is probable that the exterior fluids passed through the anus and cloaca into 

 the oviducts and ovaries, and finally by endosmose into the eggs themselves. 



In the fibrous tissue of the walls of the abdomen, in addition to the cubes and 

 octohedra, and equi-lateral plates, there appeared, also, delicately formed dumb- 

 bell and ellipsoidal crystals. 



When the plantar fascia of the foot was cut through, from the incision flowed 

 a fluid resembling the liquor sanguinis mixed with a little blood, which, under a 

 magnifying power of 210 diameters, contained beautiful octohedral and dumb- 

 bell crystals of the oxalate of lime. 



This experiment was repeated with slight variations, as to the length of the 

 time, and the density of the fluids, and in every instance, without any exception, 

 the results were the same. 



In one instance, the deposit formed within the blood and tissues of the frog, 

 assumed the form of delicate dumbbell and cruciform crystals of the oxalate 

 of lime. Figure 1. represents the appearance of these crystals and their rela- 

 tive size, when compared with the blood corpuscles. In another experiment 

 the blood from the ventricle of the heart contained large and perfectly formed 

 octohedra, with a few dumb-bell crystals, while the various tissues and muscles 

 contained chiefly delicately formed dumb-bells and crystals, and the aqueous 

 humor of the eye contained octohedral, and comparatively large acicular crystals.

Figure IV. the acicular and octohedral crystals found in great numbers in 

 the aqueous humor of the eye. 



We see then by these microscopical examinations, that the oxalate of lime 

 has assumed forms different in all respects from those of the precipitate thrown 

 down, when solutions of the chloride of calcium and oxalate of ammonia are 

 brought into immediate contact. The precipitate thus formed consists of mi- 

 nute irregular granules. Figure V. represents this deposit. What has changed 

 the physical form of this deposit ? It has been accomplished, without doubt, 

 by the action of the membranes upon the chemical substances in solution pass- 

 ing through them. 



Experiments upon the physical influence exerted by mucous membranes, removed 

 from all vitality , upon chemical substances in solution passing through litem. 



Filled the intestine of a Raccoon, (Procyon lotor), with a solution of the 

 chloride of calcium, whose specific gravity was 1031, and immersed it in a so 

 lution of the oxalate of ammonia, having a specific gravity of 1007. In the 

 course of an hour the exterior fluids became cloudy, with a white precipitate, 

 the oxalate of lime. At the end of two days, a copious white deposit had settled 

 to the bottom of the jar, which, under a magnifiying power of 210 diameters, 

 presented the appearance of innumerable acicular, rectangular, and irregular 

 particles, often conglomerated together in great numbers, forming miniature 

 representations of plants with their branches and leaves. Figure VI. represents 

 their appearance. 



Specific gravity of exterior fluid 1005. 



The interior fluid was next examined, the intestine having been punctured 

 and its contents carefully removed. 



Specific gravity of interior fluid 1003. 



This marked change of its specific gravity from 1031 to 1003, shows that a 

 free interchange of the fluids must have taken place. The slight change in the 

 exterior fluid, of 1007 to 1005, is readily explained, when we consider the fact, 

 that the exterior was 12, whilst the interior was only 4 fluidounces. 



Within the intestines but a small deposit had taken place, in comparison with 

 that of the exterior fluid. Under the microscope this presented a magnificent 

 crystalline appearance, differing wholly from that of the exterior fluids, and also 

 from that formed when solutions of the chlorides of calcium and oxalate of am- 

 monia are brought into immediate contact. 



The appearance of this magnificent microscopical object is represented in 

 figure VII. 



Amongst the crystals there were no less than seven well defined regularly formed 

 varieties. We recognize the octohedral and dumb-bell crystals, as the form in 

 which the oxalate of lime almost invariably occurs in the urine, not only of man, 

 but also of other animals, and even in that of birds. 



Does not this experiment indicate that the peculiar forms of the oxalate of 

 lime, occurring in urine, may be the result of the physical action of the base- 

 ment membrane of the tubuli uriniferi and its secretory cells ? 



The tissues of the intestine were next examined. 



The cellular tissue was not equally injected ; in some places there was scarce- 

 ly any, while in others there was a very abundant deposit. 



In all places the mucous membrane appeared free from any deposit of the oxa- 

 late of lime. It was found difficult, however, to decide this question by the mi- 

 croscope, on account of the difficulty of separating the fibrous tissue completely 

 in which occurred a copious crystalline deposit. 



This is not the only instance ; out of numerous examples, we will select only 

 two. 



When the bladder of a raccoon (Procyon lotor) was filled with a solution of 

 the bichloride of mercury, and immersed in a solution of the iodide of potassium, 

 a brilliant red crystalline deposit of the biniodide of mercury took place upon 

 the exterior, whilst upon the interior a light yellow mass of lozenge-shaped 

 crystals of the protiodide of mercury was precipitated. In this case also the 

 mucous membrane appeared free from any deposit. 




1854.] 207 



When the intestines of a raccoon were filled with a solution of the acetate of 

 lead, and immersed in a solution of the bichromate of potassa, the deposit upon 

 the exterior consisted of innumerable small irregular granules, while that upon 

 the interior consisted of beautiful stellate crystals. 



When a sheep's bladder was rilled with a solution of the oxalate of ammonia, 

 and immersed in a solution of the chloride of calcium, no deposit took place in 

 the exterior iluid, whilst a precipitate of the oxalate of lime fell in the interior 

 flufd. 



The appearance of this under a magnifying power of 210 diameters, is repre- 

 sented in figure VIII. Within the muscular and fibrous coats of the bladder 

 this deposit presented the same appearance. The fact that solutions of certain 

 chemical substances will pass through a membrane in one direction, but not in 

 another, might be illustrated by many examples. 



The stomach of a raccoon was filled with a solution of the bichromate of potassa, 

 and immersed in a solution of the acetate of lead ; a copious deposit of the chro- 

 mate of lead took place in the exterior fluid, whilst none whatever occurred in 

 the interior; it retained its natural color and appearance. The results were in 

 all respects the same when the intestines of this animal were treated in a similar 

 manner. 



When the stomach was treated in this manner a deposit took place only upon 

 the interior. When the oesophagus of a large rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus), 

 was treated in a similar way, only a small deposit occurred in the exterior fluid. 

 Filled the stomach of a raccoon, and a portion of the intestines of a large 

 rattlesnake with a solution of the iodide of potassium, and immersed them in a 

 solution of the bichloride of mercury ; in both cases a copious deposit occurred 

 upon the exterior, whilst little or no precipitate fell in the interior fluid. 



These facts are due to one of two causes. Either certain chemical substances 

 in solution exert an influence upon mucous membranes, changing their minute 

 anatomical structure, and thus destroying their power of carrying on the physical 

 phenomena of endosmose andexosmose; or else mucous membranes possess a 

 power of choice, as it were, dependent upon their physical constitution, allowing 

 one fluid to pass through in one direction, but not another fluid holding a different 

 chemical substance in solution in an opposite direction. When a portion of the 

 small intestine of a sheep was filled with a solution of the nitrate of lime and 

 immersed in a solution of the oxalate of ammonia, a copious precipitate of the 

 oxalate of lime took place in the exterior fluid, which under a magnifying power 

 of 210 diameters was found to consist of innumerable octohedral crystals of dif- 

 ferent sizes, also a few dumb-bell crystals. The appearance of this deposit is 

 represented in figure VIII. 



In the exterior deposit the octohedra were about one hundred times more nu- 

 merous than the dumb-bell crystals. 



In the interior fluid a deposit of the oxalate of lime had taken place, which 

 under the microscope presented the appearance represented in figure IX. The 

 entire deposit consisted of innumerable minute and delicately formed dumb-bell 

 crystals, with here and there an octohedral crystal. In the interior fluid, unlike 

 the exterior, there were over a hundred dumb-bell crystals to one octohedral 

 crystal. Minute octohedra, and delicately formed dumb-bells, were found within 

 the meshes of the fibrous tissue. By comparing this experiment with the former 

 ones in which solutions of the same chemical substances were used, we are 

 forcibly taught the following laws. 



l?t. Mucous membranes from the same relative part of the bodies of different 

 animals, exert different physical influences upon the same chemical substances. 



2d. Mucous membranes from the same animal, but from different parts of 

 the body, exert different physical effects upon solutions of the same chemical 

 substances'. 



3d. The physical influence exerted by the membrane is not the same in 

 endosmose and exosmose ; it differs with the direction of the current. 



A very important question now presents itself for our consideration. May 

 not this change of form in the precipates be due to the presence of some animal 

 substance or fluid, as fibrin, blood, albumen, or serum, and no to the physical 




208 [December, 



action of the membranes. To determine this point a series of careful experi- 

 ments were instituted with the following substances; albumen, fibrin, yolk of 

 hen's egg, warm blood, cold blood, putrescent blood, warm serum, cold serum, 

 putrescent serum, and urine. In no case did the presence of these substances 

 produce a crystalline deposit of the oxalate of lime. Each experiment was per- 

 formed in several different ways, and under different circumstances ; sometimes 

 the densities of the solutions of the chloride of calcium and oxalate of ammonia 

 were varied, at others the temperature and conditions of the foreign body. But 

 one result attended all these experiments no crystalline deposit. In many 

 instances we have mingled the interior and exterior fluids, in both of which 

 crystals had been produced by the action of the membrane, and in every case 

 the precipitate of the oxalate of lime thrown down consisted of irregular granules 

 without any crystalline form whatever. Does not this prove conclusively that 

 the simple presence of the different membranes did not cause the change of the 

 physical form of the precipitate? 



The next question which presented itself was, whether dry membranes exert a 

 physical influence upon substances passing in solution through them, capable of 

 changing their physical forms ? To determine this point we performed several 

 experiments with dry membranes, with solutions of the chloride of calcium and 

 oxalate of ammonia, varying the relative positions and densities of the fluids in 

 each experiment. In no instance was a regular crystalline deposit obtained. 

 In only one experiments, two or three octohedral crystal occurred in the midst 

 of millions of irregular particles. 



All our experiments, thus far, prove that dry membranes exert little or no 

 physical influence upon chemical substances in solution passing through them. 

 Our next subject was to ascertain the influence of inorganic septa, during the 

 endosmotic action. In our experiments we used thin vessels of baked clay. 

 These were filled with a solution of the chloride of calcium and immersed in a 

 glass jar containing a solution of the oxalate of ammonia. The relative posi- 

 tions and densities of these fluids were also changed. In no instance did we ob- 

 tain a regular crystalline deposit. So far then as our experiments go, we are 

 able to assert, that inorganic septa do not exert a physical influence upon chemi- 

 cal substances passing through them, capable of changing the arrangement of 

 their molecules. 



Experiments 7cpo?i the physical influence exerted upon chemical substances in solu- 

 tion, as they pass through the cell walls of vegetables. 



Immersed the cut end of a stalk of Indian corn in a solution of the chloride of 

 calcium, and allowed it to remain for 18 hours, at the end of which time it was 

 removed and placed in a solution of the oxalate of ammonia, in which it re- 

 mained for a similar length of time. When thin slices of the corn-stalk were 

 examined under a magnifying power of 210 diameters, a crystalline deposit of 

 the oxalate of lime, was found to have taken place within the hexagonal cells of 

 the vegetable, which presented the appearance represented in Figure IX. This 

 differs widely from the deposit formed when solutions of the oxalate of ammo- 

 nia and chloride of calcium are brought into immediate contact. The precipi- 

 tate thus formed consisted of irregular granules. 



The crystals deposited within the cells of the corn, differed widely also 

 from those formed when the intestines of a raccoon or a sheep were filled 

 with solutions of the oxalate of ammonia, and immersed in solutions of the chlo- 

 ride of calcium. 



Immersed sections of different lengths of the stem of a young and verdant 

 benne plant, in a solution of the acetate of lead, and then transferred them to a 

 strong solution of the proto-sulphate of iron. When thin sections were exam- 

 ined under the microscope, beautiful square and lozenge-shaped plates had crys- 

 tallized in all the hexagonal cells. 



When .the broad thick leaf of an endogenous plant was placed alternately in 

 solutions of the same chemical substances, a crystalline deposit took place 

 within its cells, which differed in form from that within the cells of the benne 

 plant. Different vegetables were immersed in different chemical solutions, 




1854.] 209 



which when mingled produced a deposit of irregular granules, and in every in- 

 stance a regularly crystalline deposit took place within their cells. 

 It is unnecessary to do more than recapitulate the following results. 



1. Cell-w T alls, like animal membranes, exert a physical influence upon the 

 chemical substances held in solution passing through them. This physical in- 

 fluence is capable of altering the arrangement of the molecules of the precipi- 

 tate formed within the cells, so that the precipitate which under ordinary cir- 

 cumstances consists of irregular granules, under the influence of the endosmodic 

 action assumes a regular crystalline form. 



2. The cells of different vegetables, like different animal membranes, change 

 in different manners the arrangement of the molecules of the same substance. 



It may yet be demonstrated, by experiment, that cells in the same plant, 

 having different offices, elaborating different products, may exert a different 

 physical influence upon the same chemical substance. Or, in other words, the 

 crystalline deposit of the same substance, will vary in physical properties with 

 different cells. 



In conclusion we would state that we are still investigating this subject, and 

 hope to be able to substantiate, by numerous experiments, performed under 

 every possible circumstance, all the laws and facts asserted in this brief abstract 

 of experiments. 



Remarks on the question of the identity of Booiherium cavifrons with Ovibos moschatus 



or 0. maximus.. 



By Joseph Leidy, M.D. 



In the Zoology of the voyage of H. M. S. Herald, the author, Sir John 

 Richardson, in speaking of an extinct species of ox, characterized by me under 

 the name of Bootherium cavifrons starts a question, of which I think there is not 

 the least necessity. On page 120 of his excellent work, he remarks, " Dr. Leidy 

 includes no fewer than twelve crania, all more or less mutilated, and dug up in 

 the valley of the Mississippi, in his species named Bootherium cavifrons, to which 

 he refers Dr. Dekay's specimen; and a comparison of his fig. 2, pi. iii. with the 

 same view of the cranium of the musk-ox in pi. iii. of the ' Zoology of the Herald,' 

 leaves no reasonable doubt of the fossil species being quite distinct from the re- 

 cent one. The accessory trochlea? of the occipital condyles are fully developed in 

 the fossil skull, and many other peculiarities of Ovibos may be discerned in the 

 figures, so that Bootherium and Ovibos are evidently very closely allied. A ques- 

 tion now arises whether the dentata above referred to as the foundation of 

 the proposed palaeozoic species Ovibos maximus may not be a relic of Dr. Leidy's 

 cavifrons, and this might, without much risk of mistake, be decided in the affir- 

 mative, were it certain that the Siberian crania mentioned in the ' OssemeLS 

 Fossiles' were identical in speeies with those imbedded in the drifts of the Mis- 

 sissippi ; but as yet the evidence for such an extension of the ancient range of 

 cavifrons is wanting. The size of Dr. Leidy's specimen of cavifrons does not 

 exceed that of the skull of an aged musk bull, and the dentata of maximus is of 

 corresponding dimensions. If the discovery of a dentata of the musk-ox type, 

 and of suitable size, in the valley of the Mississippi, should hereafter fully 

 establish the identity of cavifrons with maximus, it may be necessary to ascertain 

 which of the two appellations was first made public." 



That Bootherium is closely allied to Ovibos, as declared in my " Memoir on the 

 Extinct Species of American Ox," page 12, there is no doubt ; but that the two 

 genera are distinct I think is proved by the former possessing an important 

 character, which does not exist in the latter nor in ar.y other genus of Bovidae. The 

 character to which I allude is the large lachrymal fossa? cr larmiers situated in 

 front of the orbits, as in the Cervidae, and which are represented in fig. 1, pis. 

 iv., v., of the memoir above referred to, in both species of Bootherium. 



" That the Siberian crania mentioned in the ' Ossemens Fossiles ' " are not 

 ,' identical in species with those embedded in the drifts of the Mississipj i," I 




210 [December, 



think any one will grant who will take the trouble to compare the figures of 

 the " Siberian crania," in the works of Pallas,* Ozeretskovsky,f or Cuvier,J 

 with my figures of Bootherium cavifro?is. The former are indistinguishable 

 from the figures given of the crania of the recent Ovibos moschatus, while the 

 latter has no deep fissure separating the bases of the horn cores, but these are 

 confluent and form a huge process covering the entire length and breadth of the 

 frontal bone. 



Sir John Richardson has himself, in page 22 of his work, considered the " Si- 

 berian crania" as belonging to the Ovibos moschatus ; and in the above extract 

 has stated there 13 " no reasonable doubt of the fossil species," [Bootherium cavi- 

 frons) ''being quite distinct from the recent one" [Ovibos moschatus). Conse- 

 quently, he has decided that Bootherium is a different animal from the species to 

 which the " Siberian crania" belonged. Therefore, it appears to me, when Sir 

 J. R. subsequently says, " A question now arises whether the dentata above 

 referred to as the foundation of th supposed palaeozoic species Ovibos maximus, 

 may not be a relic of Dr. Leidy's cavifrons, and this might, without much risk of 

 mistake, be decided in the affirmative, were it certain that the Siberian crania 

 mentioned in the ' Ossemens Fosslles' were identical in species with those em- 

 bedded in the drifts of the Mississippi, but as yet the evidence of such an ex- 

 tension of the ancient range of cavifrons is wanting," the question had 

 already been decided that " the Siberian crania" were not "identical in species 

 with those embedded in the drifts of the Mississippi." 



Sir J. R. then says, te The size of Dr. Leidy's specimen of cavifrons does not 

 exceed that of the skull of an aged musk-bull, and the dentata of maximus is of 

 corresponding dimensions." If this be the case I would ask, as the li dentata of 

 maximus " was found in the country of the " musk-bull," and is of the same size 

 as the corresponding bone in that animal, what evidence is there that it does not 

 belong to it ? 



Under these circumstances "the discovery of a dentata of the musk-ox type, 

 and of suitable size, in the valley of the Mississippi," would by no means " estab- 

 lish the identity of cavifrons with maximus" but would rather tend to show the 

 greater ancient range of the Ovibos moschatus. 



In regard to the time at which the appellations cavifrons andmaximus were 

 made,public I deem it of trifling importance to science, but I may take the pre- 

 sent opportunity of stating that the name Bootherium cavifrons was proposed in 

 the number of the Proceedings of this Academy for May and June 1852, which 

 was distributed the following month, therefore three months previous to the ap- 

 pearance of the " first part of the Herald's Zoology." 



In conclusion I may add a list of what appear to be the species of American 

 ox, recent and extinct. 



1. Bison Americanus, (recent and fossil). The fossil certainly not the Bison 

 priscus ? Richardson.

Descriptio?is of the species of Trox and Omorgus inhabiting the United States. 



By John L. LeConte, M.D. 



Trox Fabr. 

 A. Thorax incequalis prrzcipne bicostatus. 



1. T. S o n or ae , oblongus niger, thorace latitudine fere triplo breviore, ir- 

 regulariter grosse punetato, inaequali, disco elevato bicostato, lateribus late 

 rotundatis, elytris costis quatuor suturaque elevatis haud interruptis, sptis sor- 

 didis brevissimis tesselatis, interstitiismuricato-punctatis cicatricosis, tuberculis 

 parvis uniseriatis notatis. Long. *38. 



One specimen, Tucson, Sonora. This species is very similar to the next, but 

 the sides of the thorax are less rounded, being almost straight near the base ; 

 the furrows of the elytra are distinctly tuberculate, and the general form of the 

 body is narrower. Nevertheless, a larger series of specimens may prove these 

 differences to be of no value. 



2. T. al t e r n a n s , oblongus, niger, thorace irregulariter grosse punctato, 

 latitudine fere triplo breviore, lateribus modice rotundatis, elytris costis quatuor 

 suturaque elevatis haud interruptis, setis-sordidis brevissimis tessellatis, inter- 

 stitiis muricato-punctatis, transversim cicatricosis, tribus internis simplicibus, 

 quarto costula intermedia notato. Long. -37. 



Kansas Territory and New Mexico. The head is scarcely tuberculate, 

 densely punctured with the clypeus rounded, not margined ; thorax two and a 

 half times wider than long, moderately rounded on the sides, ciliate with yel- 

 low bristles, irregularly and coarsely punctured, unequal, with the middle of the 

 disc strongly elevated and bicostate, the intermediate furrow being divided by 

 a slight transverse elevation about the middle. Elytra oval, truncate at base, 

 finely serrate on the sides, with four elevated uninterrupted costae, which are 

 tessellated with short yellowish bristles, and alternate shining spots ; suture 

 elevated ; the three inner spaces are broadly concave, with irregular transverse 

 elevations, and sparingly marked with small muricate punctures, arranged nearly 

 in four series, but not so closely placed as to render the arrangement obvious ; 

 in some directions the transverse elevations seem to indicate a row of tubercles, 

 but this is also very indistinct ; the fourth space is marked with an indis- 

 tinct interrupted costa, forming a row of tubercles ; at the tip of the elytra 

 all these irregularities fade away, and the ordinary arrangement of striae 

 may be traced. The capillary striae seen in many species are here en- 

 tirely wanting:, except in the subsutural space where they may be faintly 

 discovered. The anterior femora, as in most species, are strongly dilated 

 and crenulate inferiorly; the anterior tibiae of one specimen from Kansas 

 are without teeth; in the New Mexican specimen, besides the ordinary 

 square terminal tooth, there are two small ones at the middle, and some fine 

 serrations towards the base. 



A specimen from Kansas, of smaller size (.35) has the costae of the elytra 

 less elevated and the interstices less corrugated, so as to present, besides the 

 very small muricated punctures, two rows of large subquadrate punctures, 

 nearly as in T. p o r c a t u s , from which, however, it is abundantly distinguished 

 by the differences in the form and sculpture of the thorax, and by the absence 

 of the capillary striae of the elytra. 



3. T. s o r d i du s, niger, thorace flavo-ciliato, brevissime setoso. inaequali 

 irregulariter grosse punctato, lateribus late rotundatis, medio modice elevato

 postice indistinctis, interstitiis inequalibus bistriatis, tuberculisque parvis uni- 

 seriatis. Long. *3. 



Georgia, New York, Kansas. Smaller than the preceding, with the sides of 

 the thorax less rounded and the disc less elevated. The second and third costae 

 of the elytra are more interrupted than the first and fourth, and all are indis- 

 tinct posteriorly ; when the inequalities of the elytra are less marked, the 



18 




212 [DECEMBER; 



capillary striae appear strongly punctured with an intermediate row of small 

 distant tubercles. The anterior tibiae are furnished with a broad bidentate ter- 

 minal process, and one well-marked tooth at the middle ; they are finely serrate 

 towards the base. The anterior femora are very strongly dilated and crenate 

 on the inferior margin. The head is somewhat more unequal than in T. alter- 

 nans. 



4. T. po r c at u s, niger, sordidus, thorace longius flavo-ciliato, sordidebreviter 

 setoso, latitudine duplo breviore, lateribus antice rotundatis, inequaliter punc- 

 tato, medio bicostato, sutura costisque interruptis elevatis rlavo-setosis, costis 

 alternis minoribus fere indistinetis, interstitiis punctis magnis quadratis seriatis 

 stria capillari coniunctis. Long. 4 # 46. 

 Say, Journ. Acad. Nat. Sc. 5, 193. 



Middle and Southern States. The sides of the thorax are straight for three 

 fourths of their length, and are then rounded to the apex ; the punctures of the 

 elytra are connected by striae, and the inequalities diminish towards the tip. 

 The anterior tibiae are serrate towards the base, with one sharp tooth at the 

 apex: the femora are very much dilated, and hardly crenulate on the inferior 

 margin. In the form of the thorax this species is allied to T. capillaris, 

 but in that species the capillary striae of the elytra are much stronger, the costae 

 are less distinct, forming merely rows of distant penicellated elevations, and 

 the rows of punctures are not very obvious. 



5. T. tuberculatus, obiongus, niger, thorace latitudine plus duplo bre- 

 viore, lateribus late rotundatis, inaequali, partibus elevatis breviter fulvo-setosis, 

 dorso elevato, bicostato, elytris tuberculis valde elevatis oblongis brevissime

Middle and Southern States, not rare. Besides the apical emarginate process, 

 the anterior tibiae have only one prominent tooth at the middle ; above this are 

 some fine crenulations. This species is not much like T. sabulosus of 

 Europe, with which Olivier compares it, but is the only one known to me that 

 will agree with the descriptions or figures. 



6. T. erinaceus, minus elongatus, subovatus, niger, thorace latitudine fere

South Carolina, Mr. Zimmermann. The intervals between the series of large 

 elevations are marked with a scarcely distinct series of tubercles, hardly 

 larger than the scattered elevated punctures. The denticulations of the anterior 

 tibiae are not distinct, but one near the middle is a little more prominent. 



7. T.terrestris, breviusculus, ovatus, niger (praecipue sordidus), tho- 

 race latitudine duplo breviore, lateribus vix late rotundatis, subreticulatim

Middle and Southern States, abundant. The inequalities of the thorax are 

 less developed than in those above described, and are connected together so as 

 to give a reticulated appearance ; five of the cells are adjacent to the base, and 

 three fill up the apex. The anterior tibiae, besides the universally found square 

 apical prominence, have only one moderate tooth below the middle. 



8. T. capillaris, longiusculus, ovatus, sordide niger, thorace parce

Middle, Southern and Western States : the anterior tibiae have a prominent 

 tooth below the middle and a smaller one above the middle. When the elytra 

 are very carefully cleaned the elevated lines towards the suture are seen to be 

 double, while beyond the third series of the larger bunches of bristles, they 

 vanish entirely, and rows of punctures alone are seen. The inequalities of the 

 thorax consist of the two entire dorsal costae and a smaller one each side, ex- 

 tending from the base beyond the middle.

One specimen, San Francisco. Precisely similar in form and appearance to

 coarsely punctured : the outer margin of the anterior tibiae above the terminal 

 bidentate prominence is marked with three small but distinct teeth.

One specimen, New York. Broader than the two preceding, with the sides 

 of the thorax considerably rounded, so that the posterior angles become obtuse: 

 the fascicles of the elytra are composed of only three or four short black 

 bristles, which arise from a somewhat muricate puncture. The anterior tibiae 

 have three small equidistant teeth, exclusive of the terminal prominence.

One specimen, found near Long's Peak. The setae of the elytra arise from 

 small murieated punctures. The anterior tibiae are more tiilated than in the 

 other species; the terminal tooth is very much rounded, and above it are two 

 or three sinuosities indicating other teeth. The form is that of T. variolatus 7 

 but larger. 



Omorgtjs Er 



This genus, described at length in Wiegmannn's Archiv., (13, 111) and referred 

 to in Erichson's Ins. Deutsch. (925), contains the largest species of our native 

 Trogidae. It difFers from Trox by the corneous prominent ligula, by the first 

 joint of the labial palpi being longer than the second, and finally by the terminal 

 hook of the maxillae being cleft, and the second hook being single. (In Trox 

 the terminal hook is usually trifid.) As these characters are difficult, certain 

 differences in appearance may be made use of to separate the two genera. Thus 

 in Trox the sides of the thorax are strongly ciliated, and broadly regularly 

 rounded, while in Omorgus the sides are hardly ciliate, and are frequently ir- 

 regular, and sometimes toothed : the eyes of our native species of Trox 

 are reticulated, and the posterior tibiae toothed ; while in Omorgus the eyes 

 are smooth, and the posterior tibiae in our native species without teeth. Of 

 these habitual characters, reliance can be placed absolutely upon none but the 

 structure of the sides of the thorax, as according to Erichson, species of Trox 

 occur in which the eyes are smooth and the posterior tibiae toothless. Our species 

 may be divided thus : 



A. Corpus dpterum ; thorace bullis nitidis or nato, 



1. O. texanus, apterus niger, convexus, thorace cataphraeto valde in- 

 aequali, lateribus rotundatis ante basin subincisis, elytris seriatim grosse punc- 

 tatis nitidis irregulariter ccelatis. Long. 8. 



Eagle Pass, Texas, collected by Mr. Schott, under Major Emory, of the 

 U.S. and Mexican Boundary Commission, and also by Lieut. Haldeman. This- 

 species is larger than 0. scutellaris, and the lines of punctures on the elytra are 

 better marked ; but except in the form of the sides of the thorax, there appears 

 to be no special difference ; as in that species, the posterior outer angle of the 

 large four-angled bulla each side of the dorsal channel is produced. 



2. 0. scutellaris, apterus niger, thorace cataphraeto, valde insequali ? 

 lateribus rotundatis, elytris seriatim minus distincte punctatis, transversim 

 ccelatis, interstitiis subquadratis, subaequaliter parum elevatis. Long. *6 65

3. O. suturalis, apterus niger, thorace cataphraeto, valde inaequali? 

 lateribus rotundatis, elytris minus distincte seriatim punctatis, transversim 

 ccelatis, interstitiis inaequaliter magis elevatis, sutura costata. Long. -63. 



Texas Mr. Schott, two specimens. Distinguished from the preceding by the 

 more elevated and irregular shining spaces of the elytra, and by the suture being 

 elevated in the form of a eosta. 



4. O. umbonatus, apterus niger, thorace cataphraeto, valde inaequali? 

 lateribus rotundatis, elytris minus distincte seriatim punctatis, interstitiis trans- 

 versim ecelatis, alternatim magis elevatis. Long. *65'. 



Texas, Messrs. Schott & Clark. Also allied to 0. scutellaris, but besides the 

 inequality of the rows of elevations of the elytra, the four-angled bulla each side 

 of the dorsal channel of the thorax has the posterior outer angle not produced? 

 aad almost obtuse. The body is also more elongated.

Trox scabrosus Beauv., Ins. d'Afr. et d'Amer. 175, tab. 46, fig. 4.* 

 New York, Florida, Texas. This species has entirely the appearance of the 

 next, from which it seems to differ only by its usually much larger size, and by 

 the sides of the thorax (excluding the indentation) being rounded instead of an- 

 gulated, and by the elevated points between the large series of tubercles of the 

 elytra being much larger, and by some of them forming intermediate series of 

 smaller tubercles. As in the next there is a sutural series of small tubercles. 

 This large species is abundant, especially near the sea shore. 



6. O. pustulatus, sordide fuscus, vel niger, opacus, thorace valde inaequali, 

 lateribus medio fere angulatis, pone medium incisis, angulis posticis rotundatis, 

 elytris tuberculis serie quadruplici et ad suturam positis magis elevatis cata-

? 'Trox tuber culatus\\ Beauv., Ins. 175, tab. 46, fig. 3. 



Southern States, not rare. This species agrees very well with Beauvois' figure, 

 but his insect is said in the text to have been found in Hayti. It is remarkable 

 that while he mentions that Trox tuberculatus (Olivier) was unknown to him, 

 he should retain for his own very different species the same specific name. 



This species is distinguished (apart from the differences in the elytra) from the 

 following as well as the preceding species by the sides of the thorax converging 

 obliquely from the middle to the apex ; the effect of this is to produce an indis- 

 tinct angle near the middle ; this character in consequence of the gradual curving 

 of the sides is not seen either in 0. scabrosus or in O. asper. 



7. O. a s p e r , niger, sordidus, opacus, thorace valde inaequali, lateribus late 

 rotundatis, pone medium subincisis, angulis posticis latius rotundatis, elytris

 Long. 5. 



Georgia, South Carolina, Mr. Zimmermann. The elevated punctures scattered 

 irregularly between the rows of tubercles, as seen in the two preceding species, 

 have here disappeared ; the intervals are somewhat unequal, and in each are seen 

 two moderately regular rows of large punctures, with an intervening series of 

 small tubercles, which like the larger tubercles are covered with a brown crust. 

 These small tubercles are, however, scarcely more elevated than the places be- 

 tween the punctures forming the rows. The lateral incision of the thorax is 

 much less deep than in the preceding species, and the posterior angles are broader 

 and less prominent. 



8. O. punctatus, griseus, thorace inaequali, lateribus obliquis late rotun- 

 datis, pone medium subincisis, angulis posticis vix rotundatis, canalidorsali antice

Our most abundant species, found from New York to Santa Fe and Texas. 

 The tesselated spots of the elytra in well preserved specimens afford an excellent 

 character for distinguishing it : greasy specimens are uniformly black in color, 

 and in such the absence of tubercles on the elytra, and the less deep dorsal channel 

 of the thorax may be taken as distinguishing marks. The punctures of the stria? 

 of the elytra vary somewhat in size; sometimes they are small, deep and well 




216 [DECEMBER^ 



defined ; at other times they are broad and subquadrate, so that the less elevated 

 interstitial spaces appear transversely rugous : the alternate intervals are some- 

 times very distinctly, and sometimes hardly apparently elevated, yet with a large 

 series of specimens these differences shade imperceptibly together. The in- 

 equalities of the thorax are much less conspicuous than in the following species, 

 and the four usual posterior tubercles are rather flattened. 



The synonym last quoted is not certain, yet as specimens occur in which the 

 sutural space is more distinctly elevated than the others, it would be safer to refer 

 it here, than to retain it as a species, without any distinct character. Trox cre- 

 natus and denticulatus (Oliv.) are described as South American species, and do 

 not appear to resemble those described under the same name by Beauvois. 



9. 0. mors us, sordidus (vel niger) thorace valde inaequali, Iateribus late

Texas and Kansas. Very similar to the next species, and differs principally 

 in having the sides of the thorax distinctly incised a little behind the middle. 

 In well preserved specimens, the elytra would probably be tessellated, as in the 

 preceding species : between the large tubercles are seen rou^h places, as if for 

 the insertion of short bristles, precisely as in badly preserved specimens of Q. 

 punctatus : the smaller series of tubercles are sometimes hardly visible. The 

 inequalities of the thorax are very much elevated, and the four posterior tubercles 

 very distinct, the outer ones as usual being interrupted. 



10. 0. integer, sordidus (vel niger) thorace valde inaequali, Iateribus late 

 rotundatis, haud incisis, angulis posticis rotundatis, disco antice valde canalicu- 

 lato, elytris seriatim crenato-punctatis, interstitiis interruptis tuberculatis, alter- 

 nation magis elevatis. Long. -5 *53. 



Texas and Northern Sonora, near Tucson. As in some specimens the spaces 

 between the black tubercles are covered with a brown crust, the elytra are 

 probably tessellate in well preserved individuals. Besides the absence of the 

 lateral incision of the thorax, this species differs from the preceding by the tu- 

 bercles of the elytra being more closely arranged, and by the less elevated inter- 

 vals being more unequal. In one specimen, however, the intermediate rows of 

 small tubercles are almost obsolete. 



11. O. tesselatus, convexus, sordide cinereus, thorace inaequali, Iateribus 

 magis rotundatis haud incisis, angulis posticis paulo rotundatis, disco antice valde 

 canaliculato, elytris muricato-punctatis, crenato-striatis, interstitiis paulo con- 

 vexis spatiis quadratis nigris laevigatis, parum elevatis tesselatis. Long. *61 '65. 



This fine species is contained in the beautiful series of Coleoptera brought by 

 Dr. Thos. H. Webb from the boundary between Mexico and the United States, 

 and is labelled " San Diego trip" : for the purpose of completing the present 

 genus, the description is placed here, though it properly belongs to a paper to be 

 found below. 



The form of the thorax is similar to that of the preceding, but the elevations, 

 although very sudden, are smaller, and the anterior one is distinctly divided into 

 two longitudinal ridge?, the outer one, of course, being shorter; the elevations 

 of the elytra are nearly equal, except the sutural row, which is smaller. The 

 anterior tibiae are armed with a distinct tooth about the middle. 



Some corrections in. the Nomenclature of Coleoptera found in the United States, 



By John L. Le Conte, M. D. 



During the course of years through which our Coleoptera have gradually been 

 made known, too often under great disadvantages arising from the limited libra- 

 ries, and still more limited collections to be found in this country, many species 

 have been referred to wrong genera, and thus became placed in such relation to 




1854.] 217 



known species as very much to confuse subsequent investigators. The student 

 of local faunae alone can be expected to remove these obstacles, which fortunately 

 are now but few in number. Such of them as have come before my view while 

 arranging in my collection several families, upon which I am not yet prepared 

 to publish special investigations, are here presented, in the hope of economizing 

 time and labor for other entomologists. 



Besides these, I have found it necessary to indicate several generic synonyms, 

 which have been created by want of familiarity with foreign species belonging 

 to genera not previously known in this part of the globe, or which, from the 

 fanciful classifications frequently invented in the study of large groups, are so 

 described as to be irrecognizable, without typical species. It is to be understood 

 that the corrections here made embrace only such as have not appeared in Dr. 

 Melsheimer's Catalogue of Described Coleoptera, or in any of the synopses or 

 monographs published in this country or Europe, so far as known to the author. 



1 . Elmis v i 1 1 a t u s Mels. Proc. Acad. 2, 99. Well preserved specimens of 

 this species, found at Baltimore, which I owe to the kindness of Mr. J. P. Wild, 

 have proved that the reference to E. 4-notatus Say, made by me in Proc. Acad. 

 6, 44, is incorrect. The mutilated specimen in Dr. Melsheimer's collection was 

 insufficient to make known the character of the species, which is larger and nar- 

 rower than E. 4-notatus, with the sides of the thorax less rounded, and the punc- 

 tures composing the striae of the elytra smaller and less distant. The color is 

 yellow, with the head, sides of the thorax, margin and suture of the elytra, 

 blackish, and the postpectus, femora and tibiae dusky. From E.bivittatus Lee. 

 it is distinguished by its smaller size, paler color, and by the narrower and less 

 convex thorax having the sides less rounded. 



2. Macronychus lateralis Mels. Proc. Acad. 2, 99, does not differ fromM. 

 glabratus Say, Journ. Ac. 5, 187. 



3. Simplocaria s t r i g o s a Mels. Proc. Acad. 2, 118, (Georissus strigosus 

 Mels. Cat. Descr. Col. 35) has been shown by me (Proc. Acad. 7,) to be a Syn- 

 calypta, and very probably European. 



4. Cicones marginal is Mels. Proc. Acad. 2, 112, must be referred to 

 Coxelus. 



5. Atomaria cr e n at a |]Mels. Proc. Acad. 2, 114 (Cryptophagus gilvellus 

 Cat. Descr. Col. 45) belongs to Litargus Er. 



6. Phanaeus t o r r e n s Lee. Journ. Acad. 2d, 1 , 85, by the completion of the 

 series of specimens, proves to be a bright colored, short horned variety of P. 

 triangularis. 



7. Onthophagus n i g e r Mels. is a dark variety of O. Janus. 



8. Ochodaeus obscurus Lee. Journ. Acad. 2d, 1, 86, is no Ochodaeus, but 

 seems related to Aesalus, near which it will form a new genus. 



9. Ochodaeus americanus Westwood, Trans. Ent. Soc. London, 2d, 2, 

 66, is, on the contrary, a true Ochodaeus, but was previously known as Bolbo- 

 cerus musculus Say, Bost. Journ. Nat. Hist. 1, 178. 



10. Scarabaeus splendens Beauv. 89, tab. 26, fig. 2, is referred by Mr. 

 Chevrolat to Xyloryctes, (Ann. Ent. Soc. Tr. 2d, 18, 641,) but appears to be 

 really Strategus A n t ae u s 9 



11. Scarabaeus Bos ci Beauv. ibid. fig. 1, is also a Strategus, not described 

 by Burmeister. 



12. Anomala m a r g i n e 1 1 a Lee. Proc. Acad. 7, 81, is the previously known 

 A. binotata Burm. 



13. The species of Tostegoptera described by me, viz., T. cribrosa, ven- 

 tricosa, aequalis (Proc. Acad. 6,231 and 440) form a new genus distin- 

 guished by the ligula being deeply and squarely emarginate, while in Tostegop- 




218 [December, 



tera the same part is subtruncate ; the emargination in T. asqualis is less than 

 in the other two, but is quite obvious. This genus may be separated under the 

 name E u g a s tr a. 



14. Polyphylla variolosa Harris, is referred by Erichson (Ins. Deutschl. 

 659) to Melolontha occidentalis Linn., an entirely different species of the 

 same genus, which is found in the Southern States, and which has the suture 

 a nd three vittae on each elytron covered with white hair. 



15. Melolontha 10-1 in ea ta Say, a species of the same genus, is closely al- 

 lied if not the same as the Mexican Polyph. leucogramma Blanch. (Cat. Mus.161.) 



16. Atractopterus incongruus Lee. (Trans. Am. Phil. Soc. JO, 454) is 

 very similar to the European Sericosomus fugax ; the name Sericosomus is 

 founded upon characters, although recognizable, too slight to be admissible in a 

 system of rational classification, but as its type coincides with Atractopterus, it 

 seems proper that the latter name should be suppressed. 



17. Pyractomena linearis Lee. Proc. Acad. 5, 336, is P. lucifera Mels. 

 ibid. 2, 304 ; the latter name I placed incorrectly as a synonym of P. angulata. 



18. Pyractomena fenestralis Mels. ibid. 2, 304, is not Ellychnia c o r- 

 r u s c a, as stated by me (Proc. Acad. 5, 334) but another species of Ellychnia, 

 allied to E. ni grica n s. 



19- Alloeocnemis Lee. Proc. Acad, 6, 232. This must be added to the al- 

 ready numerous synonyms of Polycaon Lap. which has been passed from 

 Cleridae to Melyridae, and as in the present instance to Nitidulidae. Its true 

 resting place is, as indicated by Erichson in Ptiniores, where it approaches on 

 the one hand Apate, and on the other Lyctus ; a curious species found in Texas 

 by Lieut, Haldeman completes the chain of analogy in form and sculpture. 



20. Triphyllus r u g o s u s Randall, (Cis rugosus Mels. Cat. Descr. Col. 85,) 

 is Endecatomus reticulatus Mellie, Ann. Ent. Soc. Fr. 2d, 6, 213. 



21. Xyletinus sericeus Say, Journ. Acad. 5, 171, belongs to Trypopitys 

 Redt. 



22. Xyletinus flabellicornis Sturm, Cat. (1826) tab. 1 , fig. 7, does not 

 belong to the family of Ptiniores, nor can I at present indicate where it should 

 be placed. 



23. Tomicus 1 i m i n a r i s Harris, (Ins. Inj. Veget. 78,) found by Miss Mor- 

 ris to inflict serious injury upon peach trees, belongs to Phloeotribus. 



24. Pachyvhynchus Schonherri Kirby, Fauna Bor. Am. 203; Rhinaria 

 Schonherri Schonh. 7, 2,369, is merely Ithycerus curculionoides Schonh. 1,246. 



25. Brachytarsus obsol.etus Schonh. (1839) 5, 167, is Anthribus variegatus 

 Say, (1826) Journ. Acad. 5," 251. 



26. Brachytarsus brevis Schonh. (ibid.) is Anthribus tomentosus Say, ibid. 



27. Anthribus coronatus Schonh. (1833) 1, 141, is A. cornutus Say, (1831.) 

 Curcul. 4.- 



28. Anthribus capillicornis Say, (1826,) is Arascerus coffeaB Schonh. (Fabr.) 



29. Anthribus 4-notatus Say, (1826,) is A. bimaculatus Oliv. and belongs to 

 Tropideres. 



30. Trichocnemis Lee. (Journ. Acad. 2d, 2, 110) is not sufficiently distinct 

 from Ergates ; the Californian species must therefore be called E.spiculatus. 



32. Tinopus Lee. (ibid. 2d, 2, 19) is the same as Rhopalophora Serv. 



33. The genus Argaleus Lee. (ibid. 2d, 1, 319) is founded on defective cha- 

 racters ; the type A. nitens is congeneric with Leptura monticola Randall, 

 upon which I founded Evodinus ; the latter genus must therefore be suppressed. 




1854.] 219 



The second species of Argaleus (Pachyta attenuata Hald.) enters the genus An- 

 thophylax Lee. Piodes must be united with Acmaeops. Commencing then with 

 Rhagium, our genera of Lepturidae, having the front oblique, the mentum trape- 

 zoidal, and the gula emarginate each side of the mentum, may be thus arranged : 



1. Antennae ante oculares ; tibiae calcaribus ad apicem sitis ; 



a. Sterna gibba ; coxae anticae discretae Rhagium. 



b. Prosternum simplex ; coxae anticae contiguae ; oculi integerrimi ; 



Mesosternum protuberans Gaurotes. 



Mesosternum planum Acmaeops. 



2. Antennae vix interoculares ; 



a. Tibiae calcaribus ante apicem sitis Toxotus. 



b. Tibiae calcaribus ad apicem sitis ; 



Oculi mediocres ; elytra postice angustata Argaleus. 



Oculi magni ; elytra linearia Centrodera. 



2. Antennae interoculares ; oculi intus emarginati ; tibiae calc ad apicem sitis ; 



a. Palpi labiales dilatati Anthophylax. 



b. Palpi labiales maxillaribus non latiores. 



Antennae articulis externis utrinque impressis Typocerus. 

 Antennae 11-articulatae articulis haud impressis ; 



Thorax angulis posticis productis Strangalia. 



Thorax angulis posticis haud productis Leptura. 



The separation of the last two genera is evidently unnatural. The separation 

 of Centrodera and Argaleus is also on very slight characters, but as thus far 

 there is a peculiarity of appearance, which renders each easy of recognition, it 

 will be more convenient to permit them to remain distinct. The other genera 

 appears to be entirely natural. 



34. Taraxis Lee. (Agassiz* Lake Superior, 237) does not appear different from 

 Auchenia. 



35. Hemophilus f o s s o r Lee. (Journ. Acad. 2d, 1, 92) appears not to be re- 

 lated to Heliophilus, but to be a new genus near Opatrum ; Opatrum latima- 

 n us, described at the same time, is also referred incorrectly ; it is allied to and 

 perhaps congeneric with Leichenum. 



36. Pytho pallida Say, (Journ. Acad. 3, 271,) belongs to Adelina. 



37. Boletophagus tetraopes Newman, (Ent. Mag. 5, 378,) is Eledona d e- 

 pressa Randall, Bost. Journ. Nat. Hist. 2, 21 ; the last mentioned name has 

 priority by two months. 



38. Boletophagus silphides Newman, ibid, is on the other hand a species 

 of Peltis, (!!) so closely allied to P. dentata of Europe, that by Dejean it was 

 considered identical. 



39. In Psorodes Solier (Studi Entom. 167) has placed Helops contractus Beauv. 

 under the name P. inflata. The same insect was long ago made the type of a 

 special genus, Meracantha canadensis Kirby, (Fauna Bor. Am. 238.) The name 

 must therefore be Meracantha contract a. 



40. Stenochia gracilis Lee. (Ann. Lye. 5, 150) is allied to Allecula ; the 

 penultimate joint of the tarsi is lobed, and the ungues are serrate. 



41. Mycetochares ruficornis Mels. Proc. Acad. 3, 59, is a Melandryide, 

 congeneric with Hallomenus luridus Hald. 



42. The last named species does not appear sufficiently distinct from H. scapu- 

 laris Meis. Proc. Acad. 3, 57. 



43. Orchesia sericea Mels. ibid, upon which the genus Calasia Hald. is 

 constructed is a true Scraptia. 



44. Scraptia 1 ute a Hald. is not different from S. pallipes Mels. 



45. S. a mericana Hald. placed in the Cat. Descr. Col. p. 143, as synony- 

 mous with the last, is a different species. 




220 [December, 



46. S. rugosa and flavicollis Hald. do not belong to Scraptia; but 1 

 cannot find any genus in which they may be placed ; they appear rather related 

 to some Tenebrionides, than to Melandryades. 



47. Anaspis 4-p unctata Say, Journ. Acad. 3, 276, is a true Mordella. 



48. Anaspis ventralis Mels. seems to be a variety of A . rufa Say, Journ. 

 Acad. 5, 244. A. filiformis Lee. Agassiz' Lake Superior 231, is the male 

 of the same. 



49. Anthobates Lee. (Lac. Sup. 231) must be reunited with Anaspis ; the 

 character upon which I separated it is entirely false ; nor can I account for such 

 an error of observation. 



50. Lytta fulgifer Lee. is merely a dark colored variety of L. N u t a 1 1 i Say. 



51. Eugnathus|| Lee. Trans Am. Phil. Soc. (10, 375,) a genus allied to Pana- 

 gseus, must be changed to M i c r i x y s. The name Eugnathus has been already 

 twice used in the order of Coleoptera. 



Descriptions of new Coleoptera collected by Thos. II. Webb, 31. D., in the years 1850-51 

 and 52, while Secretary to the U. S. and Mexican Boundary Commission. 



By John L. Le Conte, M. D. 



Most of the species collected by Dr. Webb, have been already described by 

 me from other sources, but the remaining nondescripts contain a comparatively 

 greater number of large and beautiful species than any other collection yet ob- 

 tained. The localities are mostly given within limits. 



Cicindela prae tex tat a, longiuscula, subtus viridi-amea, abdominis lateri- 

 bus albo-pilosis, supra fusco-cuprea, opaca ; labro albo transversim quadrato, an- 

 tice subtiliter tridentato, fronte utrinque subtiliter striato, thorace lateribus ro- 

 tundatis albo-pilosis, latitudine haud longiore modice convexo, impressionibus 

 tran3versis profundis ; elytris thorace sesqui latioribus modice convexis, limbo 

 latiusculo albo, intus obtuse dentato, fascia intermedia obliqua longiuscula recta, 

 subtilius haud profunde punctatis : palpis sexus utriusque testaceis, articulo 

 ultimo ceneo. LoDg. *45 -6. 



"San Diego to El Paso." By a figure kindly sent me by Prof. Lacordaire, 

 this species seems somewhat related to C. circumpicta,yet the prolonged oblique 

 band of the elytra, as well as the thorax, which is not brilliant and not deeply 

 sulcate, will distinguish it. The species here described appears in general more 

 related to C. generosa, formosa, &c, but is more elongated in form. The apex of 

 the elytra is not at all serrate, and in the female each is considerably rounded, 

 while in the male they are conjointly rounded and the little tooth of the suture 

 ia more obvious. 



Two males found on the " San Diego trip," differ from the type by the more 

 brilliant coppery color of the upper surface, the more distinct punctures of the 

 elytra, and by the middle band of the elytra being gradually dilated internally 

 and truncate, while in the type it is rounded at tip, and not dilated. 



Cicindela lemniscata, elongata cylindrica subtus viridicenea, abdominis 

 lateribus albo-pilosis, supra, cuprea; labro alborotundato, subtridentato, fronte 

 concavo, utrinque striato viridi-micante, antennis nigris, thorace jrugoso, cylin- 

 drico, lateribus albo-pilosis vix rotundatis, impressionibus transversis profundis, 

 disco medio purpureo, elytris thorace vix sesqui latioribus, parallelisapice oblique

 que testaceis, his apice seneis. Long. *31. 



" San Diego trip," one male. This small and slender species is the only North 

 American one known to me in which the elytra are ornamented with a vitta 

 equally remote from the suture and margin : the outline of the vitta is straight, 




1854.] 221 



rendered irregular internally by two slight and obtuse teeth near the tip ; it is 

 also prolonged around the apical margin to the suture ; the tip of each elytron 

 is slightly rounded, and the margin is not serrate. 



Melanotus e r r o , nigro-piceus, nitidus, mandibulis fortiter rugosis, thorace 

 capite cum oculis haud latiore, latitudine fere triplo breviore, postice angustato, 

 angulis posticis obtusissimis valde rotundatis tenuiter canaliculato, lateribus 

 rotundatis anguste marginatis, basi utrinque late impresso alutaceo, elytris 

 ihorace haud latioribus strii3 profundis impunctatis, interstitiis fere planis, an- 

 itnnis palpis pedibusque rufo-testaceis. Long. -57. 



One specimen, " San Diego trip." This species, the second discovered in North 

 America, is considerably larger than A. scaritides Chaud. [Cratognathus scar. 

 Perty, Amblynathus niger Gray.) which it otherwise closely resembles in general 

 characters. 



Acilius maculatu s, ovalis, paulo convexus, infra ferrugineus, supra niger

 turam multo maior) laete flavis, pedibus anterioribus testaceis. Long. -55. 



Fem. striolis a basi ad quadrantem elytri singuii extensis. Mas latet. 



One specimen from the Copper mines. In this beautiful species there is a 

 complete absence of the small anastomosing spots seen in our other native spe- 

 cies. The ground color above is black with well defined bright yellow spots : 

 those of the head consist as usual of the anterior part, and the transverse verti- 

 cal spot, which is emarginate anteriorly. The thorax has the sides broadly yel- 

 low, and two narrow discoidal spots running obliquely outwards and backwards, 

 so as to form a fascia concave behind and interrupted at the middle. The spots 

 of the elytra consist of a yellow margin extending nearly to the tip ; joined to it 

 are three spots, the first extending from the base almost to the middle, undulated 

 internally and. suddenly dilated at it3 posterior extremity, as if by the addition 

 of a small spot ; the second is quadrate and placed about the second third ; the third 

 is at the tip of the yellow margin and is subtriangular, with the apex directed an- 

 teriorly : there are besides on each elytron two basal spots, the outer of which is 

 elongated ; two small quadrate spots at the anterior fourth ; a large rounded one 

 about the middle and near the suture ; a smaller one still nearer the suture at 

 the posterior fourth, and a small one very near the apex. A small yellow dot 

 may be seen between the two basal spots, but is perhaps sometimes wanting: 

 the surface i3 nearly smooth ; the usual series of punctures are distinct, and 

 from the middle of the base of each elytron to the large spot are scattered a few 

 short strise as in the females of other species. 



Dineutes integer, oblongo-ovalis dorso convexiusculus, supra niger subaenes- 

 cens, minus nitidus ; elytris obsolete punctatis tenuiter obsolete striatis, postice

 posticis picescentibus. Long. -61. 



One specimen from the Copper mines. From D. vittatus, which it equals in 

 size, this species is at once distinguished by the tips of the elytra being conjointly 

 broadly rounded, so as to leave no apparent angle at the suture. 



Stethoxus subsulcatus, elongato-ovalis, convexus, utrinque attenuatus, 

 olivaceo-niger, nitidus, thorace trapezoideo, latitudine plus duplo breviore lateri-

 tris obsolete sulcatis, sulcis utrinque obliteratis, lineisque punctorum solitis

At Camp 7. Still narrower than S. triangularis (Hydrophilus triangu- 

 laris Say), and readily distinguished by the broad indistinct furrows of the ely- 

 tra: the furrow next the suture can hardly be seen.

Copper mines and at Camp No. 6. This most splendid species belongs to di- 

 vision II. of Burmeister, (Lamell. 2, 420), but is very different from any described 

 by him. 



Chalepus obsoletus, piceo-nigra nitida, clypeo punctato, emarginato, 

 thorace subtilissime reticulata, parce punctato, apice coreo marginato, elytris

One specimen, " San Diego trip." Larger and proportionally narrower than 

 C. trachypygus ; the striae of the elytra are merely rows of fine punctures. The 

 pygidium is polished, sparsely and somewhat finely punctured, with a strongly 

 impressed line running around its posterior margin. 



Polyphylla cavifrons, fusco-ferruginea pube squamulosa pallide fusca 

 parce vestita, thorace lateribus sulco dorsali plagaque utrinque basali densius

 longissima tectis, tibiis anticis fortiter 3-dentatis. Long. -88 1-10. 



One male found on the San Diego trip and another mutilated one procured by 

 Mr. Schott on the Rio Grande. Similar in form and size to P. variolosa Har- 

 ris, but differs in the clypeus being much more concave, and wider at tip than 

 at base. The lines on the elytra are only moderately distinct, and the short hu- 

 meral vitta seen in P. 10-lineata is entirely wanting. From all other American 

 species known, it differs in having the anterior tibiae of the male (and therefore 

 also of the female) strongly three toothed, thus belonging to Erichson's division 

 B. (Ins. Deutschl. 659) with the European P. h o 1 o 1 e u c a Er. 



Copris mcecha, nigra, clypeo punctato apice subemarginato, (maris cornu

 valde elevato armato, linea solita elevata submarginali, impressioneque trans- 

 versa laterali notato) elytri3 striis sat profundis subtilius crenatis, interstitiis 

 laevibus. Long. *7T. 



One male from Camp 14. Allied to C. anaglyptica, but differs by the much 

 more strongly developed horns, the less dense punctuation of the thorax, and 

 the deeper elytral striae. From a Central American species known in collections 

 as C. ChevrolatiijDej., it differs by having all the hollows of the thorax strongly 

 punctured, and by the clypeus being more distinctly emarginate : it is possibly, 

 however, merely a northern variety of that species. 



Ochodaeus simplex, ovalis convexus, ferrugineus, breviter fulvo-setosus, 

 punctatus, clypeo haud carinato, transversim leviter sulcato, apice subtruncato, 

 elytris confertim punctatis leviter striatis interstitiis haud elevatis. Long. 25. 



One specimen from the Copper mines. Differs from 0. musculus by the 

 absence of the transverse carina of the vertex, and by the anterior margin of the 

 clypeus not being elevated : the teeth of the mandibles cannot be seen. 



Ochodaeus striatus, oblongo-ovalis, convexus ferrugineus, breviter fulvo- 

 setosus, punctatus, clypeo antice subtruncato subtiliter marginato, vertice ele- 

 vato vix transversim carinato, thorace postice canaliculato, elytris parcius punc- 

 tatis striis crenulatis, interstitiis paulo convexis. Long. -25. 



One specimen from Arispe. A little narrower than the preceding, with the 

 vertex elevated, but forming rather a transverse tubercle than a carina. The 

 striae of the elytra are moderately deep, and the intersticesare slightly convex and 

 rather sparsely punctured.

Chalcolepidius W e b b i i , supra niger, nitidus, subtiliter punctulatus, squamis 

 minutis viridi-cyaneis conspersus, thoracis lateribus elytrorum basi et lateribus

 Long. *95 1*4:7. 



As a slight testimony of my appreciation of the valuable labors of Dr. Webb 

 vrhile connected with the Boundary Commission, I have dedicated to him this 

 very tine species : several specimens were obtained on the journey from San Diego 

 to El Paso, and also on the San Diego trip. The thorax is about one fourth 

 longer tran wide, with the sides in the female nearly parallel from the base to 

 within one fourth of the apex, where they converge obliquely and are slightly 

 rounded. The posterior angles are very slightly prolonged, and are somewhat 

 acute, notcarinated. The ecutellum is cordate, wider posteriorly, and emarginate 

 at each end. The elytra gradually taper from the base, are slightly rounded on 

 the sides, and suddenly rounded at the tip : the stria: are very faint, and are finely 

 punctured. 



The thorax of the male is more gradually narrowed anteriorly, and the antennse 

 extend to the posterior fourth of the thorax, while in the female they reach only 

 to the middle : in both sexes the third joint, though as long, is not as wide as 

 the fourth. 



Chalcolepidius smaragdinus, elongatus niger nitidus, dense subtiliter

 antice late rotundatis, scutello obovato, elytris striis fere obsoletis subtilius punc- 

 tatis. Long. -9 1-07. 



San Diego trip. -Similar in form to C. viridipilis, but with the thorax much 

 less suddenly rounded towards the tip: the elytra are also very faintly striate, 

 and the striee not deeply punctured. The sc*ttellum is not emarginate at either 

 end. 



As in C. viridipilis the antennae of the male are as long as the thorax, and almost 

 flabellate. 



Pelecyphorns r i m a t u s, niger, thorace latitudine duplo breviore disco paulo

 latioribus postice declivibus dorso subplanis grossius puuetatis subrugosis, 

 lateribus acute marginatis, epipleuris parce obsolete punctatis. Long. 1-0. 



One specimen from Camp No. 7. This species is very different from any of the 

 other Asidites of our country, though it approaches the species indicated by me 

 under the name subcostatus (Proc. Acad. 6, 446) : the elytra are however 

 more densely and coarsely punctured, and without the three faint ribs seen in 

 that species. The antennas are shorter than the head and thorax, and moderately 

 thick, as in P. carinatus, sordidus, &c. 



Pelecypborus d i f f o r m i s , niger, thorace latitudine paulo breviore, lateribus 

 late sensim reflexis, antice rotundatis medio angulatis, dein usque ad basin con- 

 cavis, basi truncato, angulis posticis fere rectis, disco parcius subtiliter, lateribus 

 grossius et rugose puLCtatis, elytris thorace vix latioribus, elongato-ovalibus 

 postice acuminatis, minus profunde scabro-punctatis striis distinctis latis modice 

 profundis, humeris minutis porrectis, epipleuris subito reflexis. Long. .95. 



Santa Cruz, two specimens: in one the thorax is slightly concave transversely, 

 while in the other the sides are considerably elevated. This species is closely 

 allied to P. elatus Lee. (Proc. Acad. G, 445) but is smaller and narrower, and 

 at once distinguished by the distinctly striate elytra: the stria? in the other species 

 mentioned, if present, are always very faint. 



Euschide3 1 i r a t u s , latiusculus ater opacus, minus convexus, supra bre-nter 

 fiavo-pubescens, thorace latitudine sesqui breviore, antrorsum angustato, lateribus

San Diego trip, one specimen. Of the form of E. o p a c a ; the marginal costa 

 extends to the tip of the elytia, the inner discoidal one ceases at one-third, and 

 the other two at one-fourth from the apex. 



Euschides convexicollis , niger nitidus, thorace convexo medio obsolete

 parce subtiliter rugosis. Long. -63 -85. 



Durango, Chihuahua, Copper Mines, Los Organos, and at Camps 5, 6 and 7. 

 This species is of the form of E. obovata Lee. (Ann. Lye. 5, 127,) but is very 

 different by the convexity ot the thorax, which is only very finely margined : the 

 thorax varies inform, being sometimes nearly one half wider than its length, but 

 in general the two dimensions are equal. In the male the elytra are one half 

 wider than the thorax, in the female about twice as wide. 



Epitragus submetallicus, piceus seneo-micans, fusco-pubescens, thorace 

 latitudine vix breviore antrorsum subangustato et lateribus rotundato, basi bi- 

 sinuata, angulis po3ticis rectis, dorso.parum convexo sat punctato, elytris thorace 

 duplo latioribus humeris oblique rotundatis, subtilius densius punctatis, punctisque 

 maioribus obsolete striatis. Long. -66. 



San Diego trip, one specimen. Much larger than E. canaliculars, with the 

 sides of the thorax rounded in front and parallel behind the middle : the outer 

 striae of the elytra are almost entirely effaced, those near the suture may be dis- 

 tinguished by the rows of larger punctures. The head is coarsely and thickly 

 punctured, and inside of the superciliary ridge on each side is a moderately deep 

 jongitudinal frontal impression. 



Cysteodemus cancellatus. Meloe cane. Brandt, and Er. Nov. Act. 16, 141 ; 

 tab. viii. fig. 9. 



Los Organos, Camp 7, and San Diego trip. The variety figured by Erichson 

 has an unusual amount of red upon the elytra : that color generally forms an 

 irregular vitta, with diverging and anastomosing branches. It is closely allied 

 to C. vittatus Lee, but is larger, with the thorax more transverse, and the 

 elytra more unequal. The back part of the head is frequently of a dull san- 

 guineous color, and the same variation is also found in C. vittatus. 



Lytta atririttata, nigra, subtus pube cinerea fasciata, supra dense 

 eiaereo-pubesceri-s, capite maculis magnis posticis duabus atris, thorace latitudine

 rotundatis, elyiris thorace plus sesqui latioribus vittis utrinque duabus latis atris 

 ad apicem coniunctis, antennis palpis tibiis tarsisque nigris. Long. 1-05. 



One male, San Diego trip. This very fine species belongs with L. longicollis and 

 sublineata, which it equals in size; the antenna? are of a brilliant black, the first 

 joint extends beyond the occiput, is slender at base, very much curved beyond 

 the middle, and much compressed and dilated, with a large shallow impretsion 

 on its anterior face near the apex ; the second joint is thick and obconical ; the 

 third is two-thirds smaller, and the fourth again larger, so that together they are 

 longer than the second ; the fifth and following are almost equal in length to the 

 third and fourth united, and are progressively narrower. The under surface of 

 the body is black, with all the sutures broadly pubescent with dense cinereous 

 hair ; the under surface of the femora is also similarly clothed. 



Asclera n all i d a, elongata, testacea dense pallide pubescens, thorace obo-

 narum articulo lmo 3io paulo longiore. Long. *31 -38. 



San Diego trip : the pubescence is so dense as almost to conceal the punctures

which are moderately fine: the thorax is very faintly impressed each side ante- 

 riorly, and the sides are somewhat blackish in most specimens. 



Asclera c a n a, nigra pube subtili cinereo-cana, thorace rufo, obovato latitudine 

 longiore, lateribus ante medium rotundatis dein sensim angustato, maculis tribus 

 anticis infuscatis, dense punctulato, linea angusta dorsali laevi, elytris thorace 

 latioribus confertissime scabro-punctulatis, lineis tribus subelevatis obsoletis, 

 sutura densius pubescente: femoribus bast runs. Long. '34. 



One specimen, San Diego trip. Allied in form and characters to A. t h o r a- 

 cica, and, as in that species, the first joint of the antennae is not longer than 

 the third. 



Ripiphorus rufus, rufo-ferrugineus nitidus, capite parce punctulato, occipite 

 producto obtuse rotundato vix impresso, thorace elytrisque confertim aciculato- 

 punctatis, illo latitudine fere sesqui longiore, antrorsum sensim angustato, late- 

 ribus rectis, basi media longius acute lobata, angulis posticis rectis haud pro- 

 duces ; femoribus tibiisque apice runs. Long. 27. 



One female, San Diego trip. The antennae are brown ; the sides of the occiput 

 converge, and the apex is very obtusely rounded and subtruncate. 



Ophryastes val idus. niger (griseo-squamosns ?) breviter parce pubescens, 

 rostro crasso, basi constricto trisulcato, sulcis lateralibus brevibus profundis 

 postice dilatatis et convergentibus, thorace latitudine duplo breviore, apice basi-

One specimen, Oct. 20th, (near Chihuahua.) Larger than 0. latirostri"s 

 Lee. (Proc. Acad. 6, 443) and sufficiently distinct from all the species known. 



Ophryastes po r o su s, niger cinereo-squamosus, parce breviter pubescens,

 utrinque modice constricto, lateribus rotundatis, acute canaliculato, inaequali 

 sat dense foveato, elytris thorace latioribus rotundato-ovalibus, convexis basi 

 truncatis striis foveatim punctatis, interstitiis paulo convexis. Long. -37. 



From the same locality, one specimen. This also differs very materially from 

 all those heretofore known. 



Caelocnemis punctatus niger, subnitidus capite thoraceque sat punctatis, 

 hoc latitudine non breviore, subquadrato, postice subangustato lateribus rotun- 

 datis ad basin breviter sinuatis, angulis posticis rectis prominulis, elytris thorace 

 vix latioribus convexis seriatim punctatis, interstitiis subtiliter <*ugulosis sat 

 dense punctatis. Long. '83. 



One specimen, from Lieut. Beckwith's Collection alontr lat. 38 ; probably 

 from Utah, as the genus has not heretofore occurred east of California. This 

 species is more elongated than usual, and differs from all the others known to 

 me by the thorax being less rounded on the sides and less narrowed behind, so 

 that it does not present the cordate form seen in C. dilaticollis, &c. The punctures 

 of the interstices of the elytra are very distinct, and although smaller than those 

 arranged in the rows, are so dense as to render the striae indistinct. 



C. californica Mann, is unknown to me, and from the figure given (Mas. 

 Zool. 1844) approaches more nearly to this species in form ; the thorax, however, 

 appears to be more rounded and cordate. The elytra of that species are described 

 as having nine rows of punctures, while in C. dilaticollis Mann, only 

 eight rows are mentioned ; the fact is, that in all the species nine rows are seen, 

 but the marginal row in one description was omitted ; in cases when two species of 

 the same genus have a different number of striae on the elytra, the change is pro- 

 duced by some of the striae becoming obsolete, and the situation of the obsolete 

 striae can always be determined ; no phenomenon of the kind is to be expected 

 in this genus.

 size, situated above the fourth and fifth labials; pupil circular. Mouth deeply 

 cleft. Scales smooth, disposed upon nineteen longitudinal series. Postabdo- 

 minal scutella bifid. Subcaudal scutella? all divided. Colors disposed upon 

 uniform lodgitudinal bands. 



Obs. Distinguished from Diadophis, to which it is closely related, by the 

 presence of one anteorbital plate, instead of two, by a larger number of longi- 

 tudinal rows of scales, and the distribution of colors. 



Besides the species hereafter diagnosed, a second one (T. imperialis, B. & G.,) 

 an inhabitant of the province of Tamaulipas, Mex., was sent to the Smithsonian 

 Institution, by Capt. Van Vliet, U. S. A., as collected near Matamoras.

Bill without frontal knob, ander tail coverts dark chesnut, tail uniform me- 

 tallic green. Head and entire under parts very light cinereous with a pale pur- 

 plish or rosaceus tinge, especially on the head above. Upper parts dark cinere* 

 <>us with a green metallic lustre. 



Nearly allied to C. cenea. One specimen in Coll. Acad, from Timor. 



3. Carpophaga rtjfinuchalis, nobis. 



No frontal knob, under tail coverts chesnut, tail uniform dark metallic green. 



About the size of C. anea, and C. rosacea. Bill moderate, rather slender, 

 without frontal protuberance, wing moderate, second quill longest, legs mode- 

 rate or rather Jong, the upper half of the tarsus feathered, toes rather long, pad- 

 ded and flattened on their under surfaces, hind toe with a row of bristles on 

 t?ach side of the central row of scales, claws strong curved. 



Neck behind with a wide transverse well defined band of glossy chesnut, suc- 

 ceeded by a narrow band of dark bluish cinereous. Head above light bluish 

 dnereoas. entire under parts light purplish cinereous (or vinaceous), nearh' 

 white on the throat and darker on the abdomen. Under coverts of the tail dark 

 rufous chesnut. Back, upper wing coverts, secondaries, rump, upper tail cov- 

 erts and tail above brilliant metallic green with golden and copper colored re- 

 jections. Primaries brownish black with a faint tinge of green. Inferior cov- 

 erts of the wings pale cinereous. Bill and feet light colored. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin) about 14^ inches, wing 9, tail 5i inches, 



Hab. Unknown ; spec, in Mus. Acad. Philada. 



Obs. One specimen only of this bird is in the collection of the Academy, 

 and is from the Rivoli collection. It bears some resemblance to the species re- 

 garded by me a C. tenea, and in a measure resembles the figure given as the fe- 

 male of that bird in Knip and Prevosf's Pigeons, ii. pi. 4. It resembles also to 

 .some extent C. rosacea, (Temm). The large and well defined nuchal band dis- 

 tinguishes the present species from those mentioned and from all others that have 

 come under my notice. 



4. Carpophaga Pickerihgii, nobis. 



No frontal knob, under tail coverts light cinereons, tail above dark metallic 

 green. About the size of the preceding. Bill moderate, rather slender (with- 

 out frontal protuberance), wing moderate, second and third quills longest an<? 

 nearly eqwal, tail rather long, containing fourteen feathers, legs moderate, upper 

 half of the tarsus feathered, lower half presenting in front about three wide 

 transverse scales, claws strong, flattened laterally, curved. 



Under coverts of the tail light cinereous. Entire head and neck and under 

 parts light purplish cinereous, darker and with the purple most distinct on the 

 top of the head, the breast and abdomen, the cinereous mingling gradually with 

 the darker color of the back, which with the rump, wings and tail are dark 

 ashy brown with a green metallic lustre most brilliant on the tail. Under wing 

 coverts light cinereous, under surface of the tail light glaucous cinereous. Bih 5 

 (in dried skin) light ashy blue, feet light. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin) about 152 inches, wing 9^, tail 9 inches. 



Hab. Mangsi, Sooloo Islands, spec, in coll. Ex. Exp. 



Obs. This Pigeon belongs to the same group as C cenea ; it differs in being 

 rather larger, in having the wings and tail longer, and in having the under tail 

 coverts light cinereous instead of dark chesnut. From C. lacervulata and C- 

 hadia it differs in having the tail uniform dark metallic green, with no terminal 

 bar as in those species. It also somewhat resembles C. cineracea? but differs in 

 having longer wings and in having the head above and neck behind light cine- 

 reous instead of dark cinereous. 



The only specimens of this species that we have seen are in the fine ornithologi- 

 cal collection made by the U. S. Exploring Expedition, (Vincennes and Pea- 

 cock) now in the National Museum, Washington city. 



1 dedicate this bird, as a slight testimony of respect, to Charles Pickering, 

 M. D., one of the Naturalists of the Exploring Expedition, who, in addition to the 

 materials for his valuable volumes, has, in his manuscript notes, now in my po- 

 session, made important contributions to Ornithology.

 bill. Entire under parts dark vinaceous, upper parts of the body, wins and 

 tail dark metallic green, under wing coverts brownish black. Female without 

 frontal knob, and with all the colors paler. 



Quite distinct from the preceding: ( C. oceanica), and from all other species 

 known to me. Well described by Forster as cited above. Of this remarkable 

 species two specimens are in the collection of the U. S. Exp. Exp., Vincennes 

 and Peacock. 



10. Carpophaga latrans, Peale, Zool. U. S. Ex. Exp. Vincennes, Birds p.

 Head, neck, and entire under parts dark vinaceous, more clearly ashy on the 

 neck behind, upper parts of the body and wings dark ashy brown, under wing 

 coverts and inner edges of quills bright rufous. 



Of this fine species one specimen is in the collection of the Academy and is la- 

 belled as from New Guinea. Two specimens in the collection of the Ex. Exp. 

 are from the Feejee Islands. It apparently is allied to Columba Mayer i, Pre- 

 vost, (Pigeons iii. pi. 60).

 on the neck in front, under parts ashy white. Upper parts of the body and 

 wings dark metallic green. 



Two specimens in Coll. Acad, labelled in Europe as from the "Molucsas." It is 

 quite probable that this is the Colvmba myristicivora, Scopoli, and that the 

 large membrane of the nostril is intended to be represented in Sonnerat's plate.

 metallic green, tail above uniform dark metallic blue. Head, neck and under 

 parts of the body light cinereous, nearly white on the former. Upper parts of 

 the body and wings dark metallic blue, changing to green in some lights, under 

 wing coverts dark lead color. 



This handsome bird is allied to the preceding (C. perspicillata,) but is quite 

 distinct. Several specimens in the Coll. Ex. Exp. are from the Society Islands.

 coverts maronne, tail ashy black with a white subterminal band. Head above, 

 back, rump and wings light cinereous, scapulars black. Neck before and behind 

 and breast light vmaceous. Bare space around the eye encircled with white.

Bill with a frontal elevation, under tail coverts dark plumbeous, glossed with 

 metallic green, tail uniform dark metallic green changing to blue. Head, neck, 

 and entire under parts dark plumbeous, nearly black on the former, upper parts* 

 of the body and wings dark metallic green changing to blue in some lights, un- 

 der wing coverts dark metallic green. 



We regard it as possible that this fine species may be the same as named by 

 Wagler as above and described by Forster in Des. An. as a variety of his C 

 globice.ra. The under tail coverts are represented by both these authors as fer- 

 rugineous, which is not the case in the present bird, and there are other differ- 

 ences, especially the greater size of the species now before us. 



Two specimens in the Coll. Ex. Exp. are from Tahiti. 



15. Carpophaga lepida, nobis. Voy. Uranie, Atlas Zool. Ois. pi. 29 ? 



Bill with a lariie frontal protuberance which includes the apertures of the 

 nostrils; wing moderate, second quill longest; tail rather short, composed of 

 twelve feathers, under tail coverts nearly as long as the tail. Legs short ; tar- 

 sus feathered for half its length, thick ; toes rather long, padded and flattened 

 on their under surfaces; claws strong, curved- 

 Frontal protuberances (at the base of the upper mandible) yellow. Entire 

 hea.d, neck, breast and abdomen light purplish cinereous, (or light vinaceous,) 

 changing to light cinereous on the back of the neck, where it joins the color of 

 :he back, and becoming darker and clearer vinaceous on the breast and abdo- 

 men. Back, upper wing coverts, secondary quills, rump and upper tail coverts 

 brilliant metallic green, with golden and copper colored reflections. Primary 

 quills and tail feathers brilliant metallic blue, the outer edges of the former and 

 both edges of the latter changing to green. Ventral region, under tail coverts

and tibiae reddish chestnut color: short feathers of the tarsi cinereous. Inferior 

 coverts of the wing light cinereous. Bill dark ; feet light? 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin) about 15^ inches ; wing 8 ; tail 5 inches. 



Hab. Northern Australia? Specimen in Mus. Acad. Philada. 



Obs. The only specimen of this splendid bird that we have ever seen is that 

 above described, and which is one of the many highly valuable contributions to the 

 Museum of the Academy, made by Mr. Edward Wilson. It was obtained by 

 him in Europe, and bears a label only indicating the locality, as we have given 

 it above. It may be the species figured in Voy. Uranie, and regarded by Quoy 

 and Gaimard as Carpophaga cenea. ,

No frontal knob ; head, neck, breast and upper parts of the body, wings and 

 tail, beautiful metallic green, changing to golden and cupreous in some lights. 

 Under parts of the body and under tail and wing coverts white, the latter (under 

 wing coverts) tinged with ashy. 



Numerous specimens of this magnificent Pigeon are in the Coll. Acad., from 

 various localities. I can detect no specific difference between those from 

 New Zealand and from elsewhere.

Head ashy white, paler on the throat ; under tail coverts chestnut. Entire 

 upper parts, neck before and breast, fine metallic green, changing to golden and 

 cupreous on the neck behind and back; abdomen white tinged with rufous ; tail 

 above metallic green, with a wide transverse band of ashy white. 



Of this splendid species I have doubts respecting the correct name, Columba 

 Forsterii having been previously applied to other birds of this famil)*. It is, 

 however, very probably Carpophaga poliocephala, as cited above. 



Two specimens in the Coll. Acad, are from the Celebes.

No frontal knob, but with the membranes of the nostrils large. Head, neck 

 and wide medial portion of the under parts white, in many specimens tinged with 

 dull yellowish. Upper parts of the body, wings and tail brownish black, tinged 

 ashy; plumage of the back, rump, upper tail coverts and upper wing coverts 

 tipped with metallic purple ; sides, flanks and under tail coverts dark cinereous 

 mixed with dull yellowish. Other specimens, apparently young, with the head, 

 neck and under parts mixed with light brown, which predominates on the abdo- 

 men. 



Numerous specimens in Coll. Acad, from Australia. 



There are in the collection of the Academy various other species that have 

 been included in the genus Carpophaga by authors, but the above are those only 

 of which I have seen specimens, and which appear properly to belong to it. 



Colurnba gidaris, Quoy and Gaim. Voy. Astrolabe, Ois pi. 29, which is in the 

 Coll. Acad., is a JPtilinopus, Columba vitieksis, of the same authors, Voy. 

 Ast. Ois. pi. 28, of which the adult is in the Coll. Acad., (the young bird being 

 represented in the plate in Voy. Ast.) is more properly a true Columba. 



In the above list I have stated the presence or absence of the frontal knob or 

 protuberance, which appears to be characteristic of some species, but not with- 

 out suspicion that its presence, or at least its size, may depend on season, and 

 may then be sexual only and confined to the male birds. It has to me much 

 the appearance of an appendage indicative of the season of courtship, and its true 

 value as a character is an interesting problem. 



The species above alluded to, of which the specimens are in the collection of 

 the Exploring Expedition, will be figured in the Atlas to the volume on the 

 Quadrupeds and Birds of that Expedition, which I am preparing, and which will 

 be published during the ensuing year. 



Ilerrerite, identical with Smithsontie. 



By Dr. F. A. Genth. 



When Herrera described an apple green mineral from Albarradon in Mexico- 

 having a distinct cleavage parallel with the planes of a rhombohedron, as a com- 

 bination of 55 58 p. c. of tellurium, 12.32 p. c. of sesquioxide of nickel and 

 31.86 op. of carbonic acid, all mineralogists, who were conversant with the 

 laws of chemical combination, considered it as nothing more than a mechanical 

 mixture, though the description appears to have been that of a simple substance. 

 Afterwards, Del Rio pronounced it " carbonate of zinc, with some nickel and 

 cobalt," and this being a very probable composition, which also answers ver} r 

 well to the physical properties, it was generally considered aSmithsonite, though, 




1854.] 23S 



(no other examination having been made of it.) as doubtful. I received, through the 

 kindness of Dr. J. L. Le Conte, a genuine and perfectly pure piece of the mineral, 

 which I have carefully examined. The physical properties of it agree very well 

 with those given by Herrera ; with regard to its chemical composition, Herrera 

 has the merit of having correctly discovered in it the presence of carbonic acid ; 

 Del Rio, that of having found in it the oxide of zinc. With regard to the other 

 constituents, both were mistaken. A qualitative analysis has shown that this 

 mineral contains carbonic acid, oxide of zinc, oxide of copper, oxide of man- 

 ganese, magnesia and lime, but no traces of any other substance. The quanti- 

 tative analysis was made with the usual methods. 



B. B. in a tube it blackens and does not give any " sublimate, which condenses 

 in transparent drops," (as Herrera stated,) but none at all. Upon charcoal in the 

 R. F. it blackens, and covers it with white incrustations, having a steel-blue 

 margin, which are yellow as long as hot ; and which, when moistened with 

 cobalt solution and re heated, become green. The mineral itself does not become 

 green, but brownish black ; and after having received a good reducing heat, it 

 shows under the magnifier, and when powdered in an agate mortnr, metallic 

 copper. With borax, it gives distinctly the copper reactions. Dissolves in acids 

 slowly, with effervescence. After weighing, I have carefully examined all the 

 separated substances for their purity, but neither traces of tellurium, nor those of 

 cobalt and nickel, could be detected. 



0.6226 grs. of the mineral gave: 



0.3783 grs. of oxide of zinc, or . . . 60.76 p. c. Zn ; 



0.0137 " " oxide of copper, or . . 2.20 " Cu O ; 



0.0062 " " protosesquioxide of manganese, or 0.93 " Mn O ; 



0.0025 " " pyrophosphate of magnesia, or 0.14 " Mg O ; 



0.0092 " carbonate of lime, or . . 0.83 Ca O. 



Herrerite is, therefore, nothing else but a cupreous Smithsonite, and its com- 

 position the following:

"By Charles M. Wetherill, Ph. D., M. D. 



On the occurrence of Gold near Reading. In a paper upon the occurrence 

 of gold in Pennsylvania, read before the American Philosophical Society, and 

 published in vol. x. of their Transactions, 1 alluded to an auriferous quartz in 

 the neighborhood of Reading, Pa., and the examination of which afforded me 

 slight, through uncertain traces of gold. I stated at the close of the article, that " I 

 had no doubt that a more careful examination of the rocks in the vicinity, would 

 yield affirmative results in an examination for this metal." The views then expressed 

 have proved to be correct. Last summer, Mr. Philipps, a mining geologist, in 

 searching for iron ore on the farm of Mr. Entlicb, a few miles eastward from 

 Reading, and of Mr. Jonathan Deininger, about a mile from the same place on 

 the western slope of Penn's Mount, detected gold by washing specimens of the 

 ferruginous quartz. I called upon Mr. Deininger, who showed me the specimens 

 in his possession, and gave me some of the quartz rock from his farm. Mr. I ein- 

 inger showed me a specimen of gold, in weight I should judge between one and 

 five centigrammes, which was broken by himself out of the rock. 




234 [December, 



I have noticed tbis quarts scattered over the ground m various parts of 

 Berks county, some specimens bearing very strong gold characteristics; they are 

 partially water worn, but the angles are moderately sharp on breaking them 

 open the enclosed masses of dark oxide of iron a?e apparent. 



At the angle formed by the intersection of 8th and 9th streets, Reading, there 

 3 a heap of stones gathered from the adjoining fields, containing about two per 

 cent, of pieces of this quartz rock ; I brought home specimens with me for ex- 

 amination. These specimens, together with those obtained from Mr. Deininger's 

 field by myself, were pulverized and washed, but without, in any instance, detect- 

 ing gold. They were then smelted with litharge and charcoal, and the button 

 of lead cupelled. Of course, the litharge was examined for gold. The 30 gramme 

 button of lead from about 100 of litharge gave a silver button of 0.00575 grms., 

 and which contained no gold. 



A. 8th street quartz 65 grammes -f- 13-0 litharge -J- 10 black flux gave a lead 

 button of 14 grms., and silver 0.0075, which contained gold beyond a doubt, as 

 judged from its lustre and resistance to nitric acid, 



B. Another portion of quartz from the same locality 20t) grms 4- 400 lithrage 

 -f- 0.5 charcoal dust, gave lead IT grms. ; silver 0.008 7 5 containing gold,, though 

 not as distinctly as the last. 



C> Quartz from Mr. Deininger's fields 185 grms. + 370 litharge -j- 0.5 charcoal 

 gave 20 grms, of lead containing 0.00825 silver, in which no gold could be detected. 



On the Incineration of Filters in Analysis. In order to burn off the filters from 

 eertain precipitates i.i quantitative analysis, considerable pa-tienee is required 

 and loss of time involved,, owing to the presence of salts in the pores of 

 the filter. Fresenius, in his last edition of Quantitative Analysis, counsels patience 

 in such cases, and to facilitate the combustion by pressing tne filter against 

 the hot crucible by a platinum wire. I have found it advantageous, in such cases, 

 to use oxygen gas, as is done in some of the methods for preparing ashes of plants 

 for analysis. The results are good, and none of the contents of the crucible are 

 lost. The phosphate of magnesia-ammonia filter is thus burned off in quite a 

 short time, and without any loss of phosphoric acid. After the filter is car- 

 bonized, the lid is partially removed from the upright crucible, and a tube (plati- 

 num I use, but glass will do nearly as well,) with an orifice of one mm. in 

 diameter, delivers oxygen gas from a small vulcanized caoutchouc bag, so slowly 

 that it miugles with the air in the crucible and effects the combination quietly, 

 A crucible appears to be in the worst position possible for oxidation in the 

 manner in which it is situated in the flame, for the rising air currents are un- 

 favorable for combustion in the bottom of the crucible, and the air which does 

 enter is diluted with the products of combustion. Though this may be par- 

 tially improved by an inclined position of the crucible and lid, it is not obviated , 

 and oxygen gas seems to afford a remedy with less risk than nitrate of ammonia.* 

 1 have not yet found any objection to its use from practice, and pure oxygen is 

 so readily obtained from the commercial chlorate of potassa by using the wash 

 bottles described in my article on " organic analysis by gas," and keeps so well 

 in vulcanized caoutchouc bags that I would recommend it to a trial. 



Apparatus for the Analysis of Carbonates. Both in Fresenius' late edition 

 of Analysis and in Rose's greater work are described apparatus for the de- 

 termination of carbonic acid by Fresenius' and Wills' process, using fine 

 balances. About a year and a half ago I described, in the Journal of the 

 Franklin Institute, a very convenient apparatus for this purpose, which 

 as it appears not to have come to the notice of chemists generally, and 

 as those of my chemical friends who have tried it have approved of it, I 

 will here shortly describe.

 creating an air current over the crucible by means of a broken retort neck,

The accompanying figure, which is of the natural size, will explain itself; 

 the part E B D is the drying apparatus, containing sulphuric acid and is of one 

 piece, the tube E being melted into the flask B. In making this part of the 

 apparatus I think it preferable to join E to A before blowing the bulb. The 

 apparatus which I made myself in this way, and with which I experimented, re- 

 mained sound, while of a dozen made by a professional gentleman, joining E 

 and B after the bulb was blown, six cracked at the joint. The carbonate 

 is placed in A with water, and C, with a wax stopper, contains hydrochloric 

 acid in case of insoluble sulphates, or is empty when the oil of vitriol of 

 B is employed to effect the decomposition. The tightness of the joints 

 is ascertained and the analysis carried on as in Fresenius and Wills' appa- 

 ratus. The lead glass apparatus which I constructed myself weighed, empty, 

 36 grammes, and when charged for analysis and with much sulphuric acid 

 weighed, together with the chloride of calcium tube-hook of Oertling's 

 balance which it fits, between 50 and 60 grammes. An apparatus of Ger- 

 man glass, made by a glass blower, weighed, with its cork and empty, 20 grms. 

 This apparatus unites lightness with great strength, which is at once 

 felt on handling the apparatus, which arises from the nature of the joint of 

 E with B, and from the construction of the decomposition flask A which allows 

 E to be made of a piece of stout tube. In its construction it is simpler than aay 

 that I have seen, not excepting Geissler's (Jour. f. pr., ch. LX., 35,) which has 

 one more joint, and that a ground glass one. A being entirely separate may be 

 washed and dried ready for a fresh analysis in a couple of minutes ; the sulphuric 

 acid in B will generally last for two analyses, and is ver} r easily emptied and re- 

 plenished. A small sucking tube with perforated cork fitting the capillary end 

 of the tube D, is used to bring acid on the carbonate, to draw air through at the 

 close of the analysis, and to fill and empty B with oil of vitriol. The joints are 

 the firmest possible in this apparatus, and the connections easily made, owing 

 to single tubes passing through the two cork3, which corks being very small 

 may readily be obtained of perfect quality. I have not found any error to arise 

 from the hygroscopic nature of the corks ; but if such be feared, it is easy to coat 

 their outsides with sealing wax varnish. The following are the experimental 

 results with the apparatus : 



About one gramme of perfectly pure (tested) carbonate of soda yielded, in 




236 [December, 







two experiments, a per cen'age of carbonic acid 41.42 and 41.35, which differ 

 0.07 from each other, and the mean 41.38 differs 0.01 from the theoretical per 

 centage 41.37, sodium being taken at 23.178. 



Carbonate of lime, (precipitated commercial,) which contained sulphate and 

 iron, gave the following results, the carbonic acid being evolved by nitric: 



0.G3025 and 0.61625 grammes gave a per centage of carbonic acid = 41.65 

 and 41.70, difference 0.05. The theory for pure carbonate of lime requires 

 43.88. 



In order to ascertain the error by evolving the carbonic acid from lime by 

 sulphuric acid, two more experiments gave 38.79 and 39.17 carbonic acid. 



In order to ascertain whether the carbonic acid remaining in the flask A 

 could be expelled with a moderate boiling and thus obviate the necessity of the 

 air tube C, three analyses were made with pure carbonate of soda (the same 

 used as above) which gave the following results : 0.83, 0.859 and 1.0193 

 grammes gave a per centuge of carbonic acid 40.93, 40.34 and 40.49. 



Rectification of Mr. T. A. Conrad's " Synopsis of the Family of Nuades of North 

 America" published in the "Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences 

 of Philadelphia, February, 1853." 



By Isaac Lea. 



On my return home a few weeks since from a long absence in Europe, I found, 

 when looking over the Proceedings of the Academy, a new Synopsis of the 

 North American Naiades by Mr. Conrad.* 



Finding in it numerous errors in regard to the dates of my memoirs and the 

 fynonomy of my species, I desire that the correction of part at least of these 

 errors may reach the scientific public by the same channel. I think it will be 

 difficult for anyone to understand how so many errors of dates, &c. could have been 

 written down. I had hoped that the day had gone by among us here, when any 

 other object than the true interests of science should have existed. It has been 

 very painful for me to be called upon, as I am, to defend my scientific labors 

 from an attempt to deprive me of much of that which I have won by pa- 

 tient labor and continued assiduity for so many years, and must protest against; 

 the recognition of the incorrect dates which I shall point out to the satisfaction, 

 T trust, of every man of science who takes any interest in the study of this 

 branch of Natural History. 



I do not mean to correct the synonomy of this Synopsis, but I trust to satisfy 

 every one, that it can be of no value whatever where theda'es are so erroneously 

 stated. For myself, I shall rest until I have further light on the synonomy of 

 my Synopsis of this Family published in 1852, -which I believe will be found in 

 the main to be correct. It certainly was my intention to do justice to every 

 naturalist, and whenever I shall be shown not to have done so I will most will- 

 ingly make reparation. 



Mr. Conrad commences his Synopsis by 6aying, " The present attempt to give 

 a synonomy of the North American Nuiades, has originated from the absence of 

 dates and references in Mr. Lea's memoirs. To render strict justice to every au- 

 thor according to date of publi< ation, is not only the duty of the naturalist, but 

 a necessity of science." (Vol. 6, page 243.) 



If it were true that my memoirs were without " dates and references," and 

 the truism of the duty of naturalists to render justice was complied with by 

 the author, there would have been no occasion for me to trouble the Academy with 

 a rectification. He usually takes the date of the title of the Volume of the Trans- 

 actions of the American Philosophical Societv, where the species may have been 

 described, while the volumes published by the Society, as they are almost univer- 

 sally by all scientific bodies, were realty issued in parts at different times and gene- 

 rally in three parts. Thus when part first of any volume was issued, the Society 

 distributed copies immediately to their subscribers and to all the principal socie- 



Vol. 6, p. 243, Feb. 8, 1853.

ties in Europe and in this country ; and, when I have had in such part a memoir, 

 1 had two hundred and fifty copies printed for my own use, one hundred and 

 fifty of which I at once distributed at heme and abroad where I thought they 

 might be useful to science. When part second of the same volume may have 

 been printed, the same process took place, and when part third was ready, it took 

 the same course, with this addition, viz. a title page for the whole volume was 

 printed for the convenience of those who might choose to have their three parts 

 bound into a volume, and this title bore the date of the last part. Thus most 

 of these copies of my descriptions with figures, may have been in the hands of 

 the Zoologists of Europe and America for two or three years prior to the date 

 at which Mr. Conrad has stated them as being published. In addition, he usually 

 pays no regard to the dates of my descriptions printed in the Proceedings of the 

 American Philosophical Society or otherwise, prior to their subsequent issue in 

 the Transactions. Thus on the 18th August, 1843, I read a number of descrip- 

 tions before that Society and permission was granted to me to print them at 

 once. The following day, Aug. 19th, these descriptions were printed and circu- 

 lated. Now Mr. Conrad in his synopsis dates these as published in 1846 !* 

 three years aftar they were actually issued printed. The rule, however, which 

 the author says he will adopt of taking the date of the whole volume, when the 

 da f e of publication of each species cannot be otherwise obtained, is not always 

 followed, for the date in the title page of Vol. 3d is 1830, while the following 

 species described in this volume, U. occidens, U. rubiginosus, U. mulliradiaius, and U. 

 securis, he date3 in 1832, and U. helerodon,\ in the same memoir, he dates 1833; thus 

 species described and printed in (he same memoir, are by him often dated in different 

 years. 



The question as to fixing with precision the date of discovery of a new form, 

 has been one of anxiety and doubt among men of science. For myself I have 

 never felt satisfied that it was judicious to make any change in the long received 

 rule of permanently fixing the date of publication! to be that, when the paper 

 was read before and deposited with the officers of a learned Society, with a view 

 to printing. Receiving as authority the dates issued by individuals in publica- 

 tions is exceedingly dangerous. There may be antedates, and these can rarely 

 be detected. In the case of a deposit of a paper with a learned society, in- 

 tended for publication, and a record being made of it at the time, there cannot 

 be any probability by collusion of the officers to make a change. 



As much of Mr. Conrad's Synopsis involves the names and claims of Mr. Rafin- 

 esque, it becomes necessary to say something in explanation of my having in my 

 papers adopted but few of his names. It has been asserted that I wished to de- 

 prive this unfortunate naturalist of the credit of his labors. This I must deny. 

 I believe I was the very first writer who, coming into this field of inquiry, showed 

 a desire to do him justice. When I commenced, in 1827, the series of papers 

 which has grown since to many volumes, I did not find a single species credited 

 to Rafiuesque by Mr. Say or Mr. Barnes; but my friends, Dr. Griffith, Mr. Hyde, 

 Mr. Peale, Dr. Green and Mr. Stewart, all my predecessors, thought they could 

 recognise, probably, three or four of his species. In 1831. Professors Short and 

 ISaton, of Transylvania Medical College, Lexington, published in the Transylvania 

 Journal of Medicine a descriptive catalogue of the Naiades then known to them t 

 having collected quantities of them in Kentucky, Ohio, &c. As Mr. Rafiuesque 

 had been a professor in the same college, they very naturally desired to give him 

 all they could identify, and out of thirty-five species in their list, Mr. Rafinesque

 and U. negUctus.

\ Publication does not necessarily mean printing and issuing a notice of a fact 

 or a discovery. Dr. Webster says, that publication is a "notification either by 

 words, writing, or printing," and Johnson defines it "the act of notifying to the 

 wor;d." 




238 [December, 



has but six given to him, viz: mytiloides, torulosus, metanever, torsus, iriqueler and 

 scalenius, the first, fourth and sixth of which Mr. Conrad now rejects.* 



I went to the task of examination with the sincerest desire of making out as 

 many as possible of Rafinesque's species ; and having his original work before me, 

 went over it carefully four different times, but with nearly the same result as my 

 predecessors. I gave it up in despair, and lost my labor ; and I think I shall 

 show further on, that Mr. Conrad himself affords the test evidence of the utter 

 impossibility of satisfactorily fixing Mr. Rafinesque's species. It is now thirty- 

 four years since he published his memoirs, and for nineteen years Mr. Conrad 

 has had the advantage of having shells labelled by, he says, Mr. Rafinesque him- 

 self, f A single species, the TJnio triangularis Raf. of Mr. Conrad's Synopsis of 1834, 

 with its synonyms, will convince any unprejudiced person of the impossibility of 

 the attempt made to establish Mr. Ra6nesque's species. J 



Dr. Griffith, Mr. Hyde and Mr. Peale have often told me that Mr. Say would 

 not listen for a moment to such an idea as giving any regard to his species, and 

 the works of Mr. Say fully justify this fact by the total absence of any re- 

 cognition of his authority for a single species, until some fourteen years after Mr. 

 Rafinesque's publication, he was induced to make his "Synonymy of the Western, 

 North American species of the genera Unio and Alasmodonta," recognising 

 many of the species of Rafinesque, and denying to me a single one. 



The feeling of the western conchologists was almost universally against the at- 

 tempt to introduce Rafinesque's names, and most of those who had studied these 

 shells, and written on them, or were writing on the subject, addressed me on the 

 occasion, in utter despair of making them out.|| 



The principal conchologists of Ohio, in April, 1836, agreed to form " a list to 

 be adopted by western conchologists," and after consulting together on the sub- 

 ject, a manuscript list was sent to me by Judge Tappan, containing 112 species of 

 Uniones, three only of which are given to Rafinesque. In August following, they 

 more maturely considered the subject, and agreed to the nomenclature of a list 

 in which a single species only is credited to him, and this with a mark of doubt. 

 In a letter to me from Prof. Kirtland when he undertook the Zoological portion 

 of the Ohio State Survey, he says, "I am particularly pleased with your arrange- 

 ment of the Naiades \ It is altogether preferable to anything of the kind that 

 has ever come before the scientific public, and will bear the test of the closest 

 scrutiny and the severest criticism." * * * "I was unwilling to complete my 

 report on our conchology until I could avail myself of the information which it 

 contained. I shall adopt your names and arrangement with hardly an alteration." 

 When this important State Report came out in 1838, in the whole list of nearly one 

 hundred species of the family JYa'iades, there were but two accredited to Rafines- 

 que, viz : metanever and mytiloides, the latter of which Mr. Conrad does not admit 

 as a species in his Synopsis, but now declares it to be a synonym to clavus Lam. 

 Notwithstanding the decisions of the ablest of the western zoologists, there was 

 still an attempt to substitute by "guessing," the names of Rafinesque. This induced 



*Mr. Poulson says in the preface of his translation, (Oct. 1831,) that but four 

 of Rafinesque's species were "known by his names, either in the works of Ameri- 

 can authors or in our collections." 



fThis was done some twelve years after the descriptions were published, and 

 at a time when I believe no one in any branch of science considered him as re- 

 liable authority. He had been, according to Dr. Binney, in a "diseased state of 

 mind " for thirteen years. I believe no one pretends to say that the original 

 Specimens described by Rafinesque are in existence

 this name and its abandonment at last.

 exist at present," and that he described in "Natural History style, twelve new 

 species of thunder and lightning."

the members of the "Western Academy of Natural Sciences of Cincinnati," in 

 January, 1849, to review the subject, with an intention of settling this matter of 

 nomenclature. With that Society there could be no partialities, there could be 

 no reason for favoritism, any more than with the Reporter of the State, or the 

 other zoologists who had devoted so many years to the study of these interesting 

 molluscs. They went to the task with no other object than to " render strict 

 justice to every author." The result was published in a small work, "Catalogue 

 of the U?iios, Alasmodontas, and Anodontas of the Ohio river and its northern 

 tributaries, adopted by the Western Academy of Natural Sciences of Cincinnati, 

 January, 1849." There were admitted sixty-seven distinct species, of which three 

 'only are ascribed to Rafinesque, U.flavus, U.flexuosus and IT. nodulatus* 



If I had been singular in my inability to make out Rafinesque's species and to 

 recognise him as authority, I should not, perhaps, have ventured alone, but the 

 exception is on the other side. If we turn to the admirable work of the late Dr. 

 Binney, on the " Terrestrial Molluscs of the United States," and there is not a more 

 able and judicious writer on the subject, we find that he wholly discards Mr. Raf- 

 inesque as being worthy of any regard. He says that the papers of Rafinesque 

 " are not deemed worthy of any consideration," (p. 36,) and further on he says 

 that" his diseased state of mind was observed about 1818" (p. 44); and again 

 at p. 48, he says, as the genera and species proposed by Rafinesque " are con- 

 sidered to be destitute of authority and entirely unworthy of notice, no mention 

 of them will be made in the text." He was in the habit of naming and describing 

 species which he never saw, as mentioned by Major LeConte, and a very remark- 

 able case of this kind exists in his publication of his genus Tremesia, in the same 

 paper with the Naiades. He described it as a trivalve fresh water shell living on 

 the rocks, near the mouth of the Ohio, like the Patellcs. He described the animal 

 and shell, and figured them (p. 54). But it is not pretended that he ever saw 

 either, and I doubt if there be one zoologist in the United States who believes in 

 the existence of the thing at all. In the American Monthly Magazine, Rafinesque, 

 in a previous notice, describes it under the information of Mr. Audubon. He does 

 not himself pretend to have seen it. 



When I was in Paris, in 1832, Baron Ferussac told me that I was wrong in 

 admitting a single species of Rafinesque's if I had any doubt myself about them. 

 He was convinced himself that he could not identify with certainty a single spe- 

 cies. In the Magazine de Zoologie, p. 13, he says that u he had received from 

 him the same shells under different names, and others with the names evidently 

 not those which were given to them in his Monography. Therefore there results 

 inextricable difficulty for the determination of his species, to establish an exact 

 synonymy between him and others, who since have occupied themselves with 

 the mussels." It is true that the Baron subsequently made a catalogue in which 

 he gave precedence to many of Rafinesque's names; but it must be remembered, 

 that this was done under the impression that these were identified as the original 

 specimens described by him, and not, as now understood to be the case, new labels 

 to other specimens, some twelve or fourteen years afterwards. We have seen above 

 that Ferussac could make nothing of the labelled specimens sent to him by Ra- 

 finesque, " marked by his own hand," which marking Mr. Conrad assumes as 

 definite, while in reality I do not think them entitled to the least consideration. 



*Stronger evidence could not be presented of the futility of the efforts made 

 by naturalists to give Rafinesque what they could by careful examination. The 

 earlier concholgists thought they could make out four of his species, torsus 1 my- 

 iiloides, metanever and scalenius. Professors Short and Eaton gave him mytiloides 

 torulosas, metanever, torsus, triqueter and scalenius. Judge Tappan, with the best 

 disposition, gave him, metanever, verucosus and tuberadatus, but all with doubt. 

 In the list made by the western conchologists there is but one, IT. viridis, the de- 

 scription of which Judge Tappan says equally well applies to iris. In Dr. Kirt- 

 land's State Report, he accredits two to Rafinesque, metanever and mytiloides, and 

 the Western Academy of Natural Sciences give him only flavus, flexuosus and 

 nodulaius, not one of which is given to him by the other authorities above quoted. 

 Could anything, therefore, be more uncertain ? 




240 [December, 



Many years ago the distinguished zoologist, Mr. Swainson, sent to me from Lon- 

 don, for the purpose of identification, a numher of Uniones, which he had received 

 from Rafinesque, but of which he could make nothing. The confusion of pieces of 

 valves and names formed such a mass as utterly to defy any attempt at recogni- 

 tion of his species. I returned them, totally unable to identify them with any 

 satisfaction. Dr. Ward said that Rafinesque's descriptions and outline " would 

 equally well apply to six or eight different species." These facts fully account 

 for the difference of judgment between Mr. Say and Mr. Conrad in their Synopses, 

 both published in this city, dated April 1834. Even they with the 'specimens be- 

 fore them marked by Rafinesque himself, could not agree in very many cases. 

 Mr. Say considered that caslaneus, Lea, was lecvigatus, Raf., while Mr. Conrad 

 placed lens, Lea, as asjnonym to Icevigatus. Mr. Say makes zigzag, Lea, and do- 

 naciformis, Lea, synonyms to nervosus, Raf., while Mr. Conrad doubts that zigzag 

 is synonymous with nervosus, and makes do naciformis synonymous with truncatus, 

 Raf., which (donactformis) in his appendix, the next year, he considers a distinct 

 species, but which in the new synopsis of 1853 he placed with zigzag, as synony- 

 mous with nervosus, Raf.! 



Without going further into long statements of discrepancies between Mr. Say 

 and Mr. Conrad in regard to establishing Rafinesque's species, it will be enough 

 to say that in the Synopsis of Mr. Say it will be found that out of sixty-one des- 

 criptions by Rafinesque he gives him thirty-eight species, and by comparing 

 these with the new Synopsis of Mr. Conrad, eighteen of them are more or less 

 different in their synonymy, or are entirely dismissed from the list of species.* 



Not wishing to devote too much time or space to tracing out the changes of 

 of opinion by Mr. Conrad from time to time in attempting to substantiate Ra- 

 finesque's species, it will be sufficient to trace a single one through the various 

 sinuosities which he has carried it to this period. I do not know how many there 

 may be like it, but I think it ought to be sufficient to satisfy any one, that syno- 

 nyms based on such uncertain authority ought to be most carefully scrutinized. 

 The " synoptical table of the species of American Naiades with Synonyms," 

 April 1834, was got up by Mr. Conrad with a view, he says, to u rectify the con- 

 fused nomenclature of American Naiades." How successfully this has been car- 

 ried out may be seen by tracing this only one which I have attempted to follow en- 

 tirely through with its connections. In the list of species (p 72) Mr. Conrad 

 sets down U. triangularis, Raf. as an established species, and adds as synonyms 

 lateralis Raf, sintoxia Raf., pachostea Raf., mytiloides Raf, ruber Raf. and pyrami- 

 datus Lea. Eighteen months afterwards, this u retification of confused nomen- 

 clature, was found to require itself a rectification, and we find in an appendix 

 dated Oct. 1835, under the caption of additions to and corrections of, the catalogue 

 of species of American Naiades," that ruber Raf. is not a synonym to triangularis, 

 but really a species, and that pyramidatus Lea, is a synonym to it ; also, that 

 pachostea Raf. was erroneously placed as a synonym to triangularis Raf., it too 

 oecoraes a type, and Cooperianus Lea, is assigned as a synonym to it. Mytiloides 

 likewise is no longer a synonym to triangularis, but it becomes one to clavus 

 Lam. The other three are as yet still considered synonyms to the type triangula- 

 ris might be better to cite a few of those to show at a glance, how much dis- 

 crepancy of opinion there is between Mr. Say and Mr. Conrad, and to show how 

 dangerous it is to science to admit such "guessing" where nothing should be 

 set down as certain that could not bear the test of scrutiny.

ris Raf. But, in the following year, June 1836, in his " Monography of the Family 

 Unionida" p. 41, Mr. Conrad describes and figures mytiloides Rat. as a type, and 

 assigns to it as synonyms ruber Raf. pyramidatus Lea, and cardiacea " Say of 

 Guerin," and in his observations on this shell, now first considered by him to be 

 a species, he says, " this common species, since its first discovery in the Western 

 waters, has always been known by the name we have adopted"!* After these 

 three attempts one might reasonably conclude that the synonymy of triangularis 

 was perfectly settled to the satisfaction of the author of the Synopsis, but such 

 proved far from being the case. Seventeen years of further experience found Mr. 

 liafinesque's species " marked by his own hand," did not make his own species 

 right, and we have in Mr. Conrad's Synopsis of 1853, a remodelling of these names 

 of the most extraordinary kind. Triangularis which in 1834 was declared to be 

 a type with six synonyms is entirely dismissed, not recognized even as a synonym. 

 Lateralis, which then was pronounced to be a synonym to it, has also been dis- 

 missed. Pachostea, another of the synonyms, but which was in 1835 raised to 

 the rank of a type, is sunk into the same oblivion. Mytiloides which had been in 

 1836 raised to a species, from a synonym in 1834 to triangularis, and in 1835 

 changed to a synonym to clavus Lam., is continued a synonym to clavus, with 

 some entirely new companions, viz., scalenius Raf. cuneaius Raf. and modiolifor- 

 mis Say. We find sintozia which had remained for nineteen years, during all the 

 changes, a synonym to triangularis is now decided to be a species, and it assumes 

 that rank without any synonym. Ruber is once more considered to be a species. 

 It was in the Synopsis of 1834 pronounced to be a synonym to triangularis Raf. 

 In 1835 it was considered a species, and pyramidatus Lea assigned as a synonym 

 to it. In 1836 it was degraded to the rank of synonymy again, and had myti- 

 loides Raf. for its type. In 1853 we find it again promoted to the rank of a spe- 

 cies, with pyramidatus Lea, and coccineus Jay, as synonyms ! And will it be be- 

 lieved, after all these various attempts to "rectify" what was pronounced with 

 so much formality to be the object of the writer, and to "render strict justice to 

 every author," that he says, in a supplementary note, on this U. triangularis Raf. 

 in this Synopsis (p. 267) that " Mr. Poulson's cabinet contains no authentic speci- 

 men of this species, which is one I have never identified." What must we think 

 of such an admission? In 1834 he forms a Sjmopsis under the declaration that 

 he has at his command the specimens marked by Rafinesque himself. In this 

 Synopsis he declares triangularis Raf. to be a species with six synonyms. Through 

 the course of three years he separates from these synonyms three of them, which 

 he raises to the rank of species, and then at the end of nineteen years, he drops 

 the important type entirely, and candidly informs us in a note that it is a species 

 he "had never identified !" and in the same note he says that u pachostea, CUfford- 

 iania and lateralis are also uncertain species." 



It will strengthen the evidence of the utter futility to attempt the establishment 

 of Rafinesque's species, by looking at Mr. Say's Synopsis, which had the same object 

 in view. He declares this U. triangularis Raf. to be a distinct species, and assigns 

 to it as a synonym U. ellipsis Lea.f and he pronounced my HI tides Raf. a species 

 which Mr. Conrad at the same time placed as a synonym to triangularis Raf.f 



. _ _ __ _ . 1 . 



* Subsequently it will be seen that this species is degraded in the synopsis of 

 1853 again into the ranks of synonymy. 1 believe I was the first to give it a 

 place (1829) in the lists made to endeavor to throw light on the subject, and I 

 continued it in the various editions of my Synopsis in 1836, 1838 and. 1852, more 

 because a certain triangular shell was generally known to us under this name of 

 Rafinesque's, than that his description really fitted it. 



f Mr. Say had previously, in his American Conchology 1831, considered U. ellip- 

 sis Lea, as being established, and he had figured and described it as mine. 



X If it were necessary to have further evidence of the uncertainty of Rafin- 

 esque's species, we might trace another of these numerous discrepancies, taking 

 scalenius. Mr. Conrad in his Synopsis 1834 gives scalenius the rank of a species, 

 giving as synonyms cuneaius Raf. &ndpatulus Lea. In his appendix 1835 he makes 

 scalenius Raf. and modiobformis Say. synonyms to clavus Lam. In 1838, Mono- 

 graphy p. 92, he describes and figures patulus Lea., making it a distinct species, 

 and in his Synopsis 1853 he adds mytiloides to the synonym of clavus Lam., having 

 in 1836 considered mytiloides a distinct species, but he is still not sure tha.tcunea.tu4 




242 [DECEMBER, 



I shall be much surprised if the exposition of this species, triangularis Raf. will 

 not satisfy all unprejudiced zoologists of the hopelessness of these attempts to es- 

 tablish Rafinesque's species of the Naiades. 



We come now to by far the most important part of Mr. Conrad's Synopsis the 

 dates. He commences in the first line of his Synopsis, with the avowed purpose, 

 in forming it, to supply an assumed " absence of dates and references in Mr. Lea's 

 Memoirs," and he promises to "render strict justice" to every author according 

 to date of publication. Any one unacquainted with my memoirs, would suppose 

 from this that some at least were without dates ; such is not the fact ; every one of 

 tbem running through a course of twenty-five years is dated. The record of their 

 date is in the minute book of the American Philosophical Society and the record 

 of the day on which they were read and deposited with the Society, for publication, 

 is printed at the. caption of every one of the numerous memoirs, put there by the 

 officers of the Society. The day on which all these memoirs were issued printed, 

 is not easily ascertained, and this gives Mr. Conrad a field for assigning to them 

 erroneous dates, as we shall see in the sequel. It is a mere matter of figures, but 

 it will be seen that many are wrongly put down in his Synopsis. During the first 

 ten or twelve years that I was engaged in writing these memoirs, no one considered 

 there could exist any doubt, as to an author being entitled to his discovery ; if it 

 was communicated to a learned Society, and really was a discovery. It being is- 

 sued, printed, afterwards, was considered a diffusion of a knowledge of it. The 

 Society then printed no " Proceedings" to give immediate notice of such discoveries 

 abroad. It was not until in 1838 that the "Proceedings" were commenced. After 

 this period it was generally thought best to print in the " Proceedings" the sim- 

 ple descriptions of the species in a memoir, and the whole, in extenso, was sub- 

 sequently inserted in the Transactions. 



Mr. Conrad has declared that he will not regard the date of the reading of any 

 such described species, and acting under this principle he cuts out a large num- 

 ber of my names, classifying them among the synonyms. But he is by no means 

 satisfied with this reduction. The date of a very large number is erroneous as 

 to the time of their being actually printed and circulated, as I have mentioned in 

 the first part of this paper, that is, by assuming the date of issuing the first part 

 of a volume to be that, when the last part was issued, while the first part may 

 have been circulated some years before. 



In order to occupy as little space as possible, I will endeavor to tabulate these 

 errors. To take up my species in the order in which they occur in his Synopsis 

 and correct them, seriatim, would require great space. I commence with my first 

 memoir in 1827, and proceed chronologically to 1852.

Raf. is not distinct, as he says in a note that it may be a distinct species. Mr. Say 

 in his Synopsis makes scalenius Raf. and cunealus Raf. both distinct species. 



*The four other species of this memoir are given by Mr. Conrad without any date. 



fThis may be a typographical error and intended to be 1832, the same as lan- 

 ceolatus above it. Giving Mr. Conrad the benefit of this, it will still be found 

 that he has dated these two species fi ve years after they were read to the Society, 

 four years after they were printed and issued, and two years after the date of the 

 title page of the whole volume.

Tn my last Memoir read before and deposited with the American Philo-

 species. Two of these Mr. Conrad has omitted, viz. : U. Oregonensis Lea, 

 and U. sticcissus Lea. Twelve he inserts without date ; the remainder are 

 dated correctly, 1852. 



This finishes the corrections of the numerous errors of date in Mr. Conrad's 

 Synopsis, as regards the long series of my memoirs in the Trans. Am. Phil. 

 Soc. It will be seen by the above tables of corrections, that he has, under his own 

 rule of the time of issuing them printed, erroneously dated about ninety of my 

 species. I do not pretend in this rectification to correct the synonomy of the

Synopsis, as I have stated before. It would require too much space and time. 

 Those interested in the subject must jud^e between the two synopses. I have 

 certainly seen nothing in Mr. Conrad's to induce me to change the synonomy of. 

 mine. I shall be at all times most willing to render my own more perfect by 

 corrections founded on fact. 



Mr. Conrad gives precedence to claims on various principles. Sometimes he 

 gives the priority of manuscript names in letters or labels, to printed descrip- 

 tions and figures, as in the case of JJnio coccineus, which I described and figured 

 in the Trans. Am. Phil. Soc (Dec. 19, 1834). He inserts it in his Synopsis 

 " TJnio coccineus, Hildreth, MSS." Certainly I never intended to deprive my 

 old and excellent correspondent Dr. Hildreth of any credit due to his long and 

 ardent services in the development of the Natural History of the Valley of the 

 Ohio. He sent it to me with many others in June 1833. There were two shells 

 which he thought to be new, and the names he proposed were 77. coccineus and 

 Alasmodonta obscura. I had previously received the latter from him and named 

 it in honor of him (Unio Hildrethianus,) and communicated it to the American 

 Philosophical Society. I adopted his proposed name for the first, as I am always 

 accustomed to do, if it be appropriate, and called it coccineus. I also stated that 

 it was the name proposed in his letter to me. I put Hildrethianus among the 

 TJniones because it belonged to a peculiar group, by form and habit, which were 

 classed as TJniones. Mr. Conrad, while he gives the name of 77. coccineus to 

 Hildreth, objects to my retaining the name of plicatus as Lesueur's, instead of 

 giving it to Mr. Say as he does. It seems to me that the cases are entirely dif- 

 ferent. Mr. Lesueur gave the shell to Mr. Say with its name plicatus, as a new 

 species. Mr. Say considered it as only an undulated variety of his crassus, 

 pointing out that variation, and at same time said, that, " it is most probably a 

 distinct species, and if so, the designation proposed by its accomplished discove- 

 rer, ' plicata,' will be an excellent one." He did not describe it, and I believe 

 all the conchological writers of the time accredited it to Lesueur, viz. Barnes, 

 Rafinesque, Short and Eaton, Hildreth, &c. It was, subsequently to Mr. Say's no- 

 tice, described by Barnes in Silliman's Journal, and accredited to Lesueur Say's 

 name following Lesueur's. It was then universally received as plicatus Lesueur, 

 and is still known as such. Although neither he nor Mr. Say described it, it is bet- 

 ter to retain its established authorship. If it be not retained as Lesueur's it 

 must be given to Barnes, who was really the first to publish a description of it. 

 The same want of stability of plan displays itself in the authorship of 77. 

 paliatus from South Carolina. Dr. Ravenel sent me this species labelled by 

 himself with this name. Believing that he meant to publish a description of it 

 himself, I quoted it in myjSynopsis, first edition, 1836, accrediting it to him, and 

 so continued it in the 2d and 3d editions. Mr. Conrad, on the contrary, accredits it 

 to me, and refers to the page of my Synopsis where I insert the species as Rave- 

 nel's, and he adds to this error by quoting for it the Trans. Am. Phil. Soc. vol. 

 x. page 79, pi. 7 fig. 20 where it will not be found, but quite a different species, 

 the TJ. poJlescens Lea, which, at p. 254 of the Proceedings, in his Synopsis, he 

 inserts as a distinct sppcies. I never described paliatus, nor claimed it in any 

 way. It never has been described, I believe, but having been so long known as 

 paliatus of Ravenel, 1 hope it will be continued as such. 1 have no desire to 

 have my name attached to any species which 1 have not been the fiist to de- 

 scribe. 



Regarding the " notes " on several species at the end of Mr. Conrad's synop- 

 sis, having long since given my opinion respecting 77. complanatus, Solander, U. 

 obliquus Lam. and most of the others, I shall not repeat these opinions; but I 

 am glad to see in a note on cariosns, Say, (p. 264,) that he has at last done justice 

 to Lamarck in acknowledging his luteolus. In this note he says he followed 

 Ferussac in referring luteolus to that species, but that his "description does 

 not apply. It very well describes 77. siliquoideus Barnes." I stated in 1833 

 that, having examined Lamark's specimen of luteolus in Paris, I found it to be 

 a true siliquoideus Bar., and therefore have ever since given luteolus priority, 

 as I was bound to do in common justice. But notwithstanding that Lamark 




248 [ [December, 



'* very well describes the 77. siliquoideus Barnes, 5 ' (under the name of luteolus} 

 as Mr. Conrad states, and that I had mentioned (Trans. 1833) having seen the spe- 

 cimen itself in Paris, still Mr. Conrad, in 1834, places luteolus Lam. as a sy- 

 nonym to cariosus, Say; and in 1836, changing siliquoideus Bar. into a type, he 

 says he would have adopted luteolus Lam., if Ferussac had not referred La- 

 mark's specimen of luteolus to cariosus, Say. Thus relying more on Ferussac 's 

 opinion (whom I found really not very well acquainted with our species) than 

 to his own judgment on studying a description, which did apply; or, on mine, 

 to confirm it, who had examined the original carefully. Now in 1853, he comes 

 to the conclusion that 77. luteolus Lam. = 77. siliquoideus Bar., exactly what I 

 stated twenty years ago in the Trans. Am. Phil. Soc. vol. 5, p. 91. 



The note on 77. viridis Raf. (p. 266) may be answered by saying that in de- 

 scribing 77. Tappanianus, I did not then believe, nor do I now, that it is the shell 

 Rafinesque had before him when he wrote his description. He does not allude 

 to the striking peculiarity of the teeth of Tappanianus, and he says his shell is 

 common in the Kentucky and the small rivers adjacent." The Tappanianus 

 is supposed not to exist in the west. The reason that I did not retain 

 the name of viridis and give it to Mr. Conrad as he suggests, was that I did not 

 believe that he and Rafinesque described the same shell, and I did not wish to use 

 the names of the latter.* The fact stated by Mr. Conrad, that the specimen was 

 labelled by Rafinesque himself as the 77. viridis, and that its habitat was the 

 Kentucky river, ought to have satisfied him that it was one of the nu- 

 merous errors of Rafinesque. f That there is an error in the habitat or the name, 

 there is no doubt. Mr. Say, in his Synopsis, with the advantage of comparing this 

 specimen labelled by Rafinesque, declares it to be his cariosus ! This affords 

 another of the very many difficulties attending the attempt to substantiate Mr. 

 Rafinesque's species. It has been the cause of the loss of an immense deal of 

 time among naturalists, and it would have been better for Natural History if he 

 was entirely "considered to be destitute of authority and entirely unworthy of 

 notice," as Dr. Binney years ago concluded. 



As regards the note on obliquus Lam. (p. 265), Mr. Conrad suggests that I 

 considered undatus Bar. a synonym, because Mr. Barnes gave it with a mark of 

 doubt. Mr. Conrad does not advert to the fact that I had seen the original spe- 

 cimen in Paris in 1832, and that I had published my note of it on my return. 



In his note on 77. fasciolus Raf. (p. 267) he says that the specimen was la- 

 belled by Rafinesque. Notwithstanding this it was not admitted by him in his 

 Synopsis of 1834 at all ! But Mr. Say introduced it in his Synopsis with multi- 

 radiatus Lea, as a synonym, which {multiradiatus) Mr. Conrad had admitted 

 as a. good species. In 1836, however, Mr. Conrad in his Monography, introduced 

 fasciolus Raf., and then degraded multiradiatus as its synonym. Now in 1853 

 he makes multiradiatus a synonym to ligarnentinus Lam., and fasciolus is made 

 to appropriate subangulatus Lea, as a synonym, which was described in Trans. 

 1840 in vol. 8th not 10th as quoted by Mr. Conrad. 



I am gratified to see (p. 266) that 77. trigonus Lea, after twenty years denial, 

 is acknowledged to be a distinct species. In Mr. Conrad's Synopsis, 1834, he 

 made it a synonym to undatus Bar., as Mr. Say also did in his Synopsis. My 

 own label on the specimen given by me to the Academy at the time, was su- 

 perseded for years by Barnes's name of another shell. There never was any 

 doubt in my own mind about it, after I had given it a proper examination. 



I object to Mr. Conrad's changing my name TJnio Moussonianus, named after 

 Prof. Mousson, to Moussianus, and that of Estabroolianus, named after Prof. Es- 

 tabrook, to Eastbrookianus , as well also Margaritana Vandenbusehiana, named 

 after Dr. Vandenbusch, to Buschiana. 



* My having done so in the 77. interruptus and one or two others was entirely 

 an oversight and unintentional. I always intended to avoid using Rafinesque's 

 names. 



f In a letter from the late Dr. Ward, of Chilicothe, 1836, he says in regard 

 to this species, " that is another of Professor Rafinesque's apocryphal tales." 




1854.] 249 



Some of my species seem to be entirely omitted in this Synopsis. I do not 

 observe U. aheneus, 77. occultus, IT. Oregonensis, 77. patulus, 77. pressus, 77. suc- 

 cissus, CT. multiplicatus (nor heros Say), Anodonta Dunlapiana nor An. glohosa. 

 In a note on cuneatus Raf. (p. 267), Mr. Conrad says it is a form between XT. 

 patulus and 77. clavus, but he does not place patulus Lea, in his list of species, 

 although in his Monography in 1838 he acknowledges it with a description and 

 figure. 



At page 258 Mr. Conrad gives 77. tenerus Ravenel, Lea, 1834, V. 63, 9, 2." 

 I never described nor figured this shell, and there is no reference to it in vol. 5, 

 Trans, at p. 63, nor is it figured in plate 9. 77. teneris Ravenel and 77. paliatus 

 Ravenel, are most singularly erroneous in their introduction. They have both 

 been well known under Dr. Ravenel's names by his kindly distributing them. 

 Having himself named them when he sent them to me, I distributed duplicates 

 at home and abroad with his names. Although he did not describe them subse- 

 quently, as 1 supposed he would, I still retained his names in my editions of 

 the Synopsis and quoted the authorship to him. Mr. Conrad, by not keeping 

 to a strict rule, gives in his Synopsis one (paliattis) to me and the other {tene- 

 rus') to Ravenel. To add to this error he refers to my memoirs for both of them, 

 quoting the page of text and the plates for figures, where they never have ap- 

 peared at all ! 



I trust that I have vindicated the dates of my species by references to the facts 

 regarding them. This defence has cost me much time in searching for the 

 proofs necessary to rebut the errors of this Synopsis, and 1 think it will not be 

 denied that it is effectually done.

Hall of the Academy, December 26, 1854. 



The Report of the Treasurer for 1854 was read and referred to the 

 Auditors. 



Dr. Leidy, on behalf of the Curators, read the following 



REPORT OF THE CURATORS FOR 1854. 



The alterations and enlargement of the building of th<? Academy commenced 

 in 1853, and found necessary to accommodate the increasing museum and library, 

 have so far advanced, that in a few more months they will be completed. In the 

 new museum room, arrangements of a portion of the cabinet are already begun, 

 but the Curators propose deferring, until the next annual report, a detailed account 

 of the improvements in the building and the re-arrangements of the museum and 

 library. 



During the year just about closing, the donations to the museum have been as 

 follows : 



Mammalia. Of this class 57 specimens of 42 species hv.ve been presented. 

 Among them is a noble specimen of an Elk, Cervus Americanus, shot in this State, 

 and presented by a number of our members. 



Birds. A small but valuable collection of bird-skins from Honduras, was pre- 

 sented by Dr. S. Woodhouse. There were also 12 species of birds presented by 

 different members. 



Reptiles. A collection of 10 species from Central America, and 16 species 

 chiefly from Texas and New Mexico, was presented by Dr. Woodhouse ; a second 

 collection of 18 species from California, by Dr. Heermann ; a third collection of 9 

 species from the Gaboon country, Africa, by M. Belloni Duchaillu ; and a fourth 

 collection of 9 species from New Jersey, by Mr. S. Ashmead. Besides these, 

 various persons presented 16 species of reptiles. 



Fishes. Dr. Heermann presented a collection of 18 species from California, and 

 various members and others presented 12 species. 




1854.] 253 



Mollusks. Dr. Albers, of Berlin, through Mr. Lea, presented a collection of 

 70 species of land shells, chiefly from Madeira ; Dr. Le Conte presented a valuable 

 collection of marine shells from the Sandwich Islands ; and Lieut. G. H. Hare 

 presented a collection of marine shells from the Mediterranean and other locali- 

 ities. Besides these collections, numerous specimens of 16 species were presented 

 by various persons. 



Insects. To this class we have obtained an unusually rich accession. John A. 

 Guex, E?q., has presented to the Academy his entire cabinet of entomology, 

 consisting of 1500 specimens of American and European Lepidoptera, and 

 nearly 17,000 species of Coleoptera, systematically arranged in accordance with 

 modern nomenclature, and nearly all catalogued. Other persons have presented 

 about 20 species of insects. 



Crustaceans, arachnides, myriapods, annelides and zoophytes. Of these classes of 

 animals, numerous specimens of twelve species have been presented by various 

 members. 



Comparative Anatomy. 2 skeletons, 5 crania, and 2 other anatomical specimens 

 were presented. One of the skeletons, that of a dog, was presented by Mr. 

 Lambert, the other, that of a Heterodon, was presented by Dr. Hallowell. 



Botany. A collection of plants from New Holland and the Azores was pre- 

 sented by Mr. R. Kilvington ; and a collection of 100 specimens from California, 

 by Mr. Henry Pratten, of New Harmony. Be ides these, 12 species of plants, 

 fruits, &c, were presented by different persons. 



Palaeontology. A collection of fossils from San Pedro, Santa Barbara, and the 

 Colorado Desert, was presented by Dr. Heermann ; a second from the south of 

 Europe, by Lieut. G. H. Hare; a third of cretaceous fossils from Dallas cc, 

 Texas, by Mr. A. Gouhenaut ; and a fourth of cretaceous fossils from Alabama, 

 and eocene fossils from Virginia, by Mr. Joseph Jones. Besides these collections, 

 fifty specimens of fossils were presented by different members and other persons. 

 Among the specimens are five of the tracks of the huge extinct Brontozoum 

 giganteum, in sandstone, from Connecticut, presented by Dr. T. D. Mutter, and 

 several fragments of Indian crania and teeth, encrusted with carbonate of lime, 

 from a cave in California, presented by Dr. W. H. Housten. 



Mineralogy. A collection of 40 specimens of metallic ores from Peru was 

 presented by Dr. S. W. Mitchell ; and 70 other specimens of minerals from vari- 

 ous localities, were presented by different members and others. 



This report is respectfully submitted for the acceptance of the Academy by 



Joseph Leidy, 

 Chairman of the Curators. 



The following resolution was offered by Mr. Isaac Lea, and unani- 

 mously adopted : 



Resolved, That a Committee be appointed to draft a memorial to 

 Congress, urging the sending out of an Expedition for the relief of our 

 fellow member, Dr. Kane, and his companions in the Arctic Regions. 



The following Committee was appointed : Mr. Isaac Lea, Dr. Zant- 

 zinger and Dr. Bridges. 



On motion, the Committee was instructed to report at next meeting. 



The Society then proceeded to elect Officers and a Publication Com- 

 mittee for 1855, with the following result :

 Vice-President Bridges in the Chair. 



A letter was read from Mr. Joseph Harrison, Jr., dated Jan. 2, 1855, 

 accompanying the donation from him acknowledged this evening. 



On leave granted, the Committee appointed at last meeting to prepare 

 a memorial to Congress soliciting aid to Dr. Kane and his companions 

 in their Arctic peril, reported the following memorial, which was 

 adopted. 



To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the XJnited 



States in Congress assembled. 



The Memorial of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, respect- 

 fully represents : 



That Dr. Kane, a member of the Academy, and his companions, may at this 

 moment be in urgent need of the protecting hand of those in whose power alone 

 it is possible to give material aid. 



Knowing well the prudence and perseverance of Dr. Kane, it cannot be doubted 

 that he has taken all the precautions possible for the safety of those who have 

 been placed under his charge in the perilous and benevolent voyage which he has 

 undertaken for the relief of that intrepid traveller Sir John Franklin. But it is 

 now known that Sir John is removed beyond all human alleviation of calamity, 

 and Dr. Kane and his companions, your memorialists believe, now stand in need 

 of that alleviation and support which they so generously volunteered at the risk 

 of their lives, in toiling over dreary wastes, and in braving the rigors of a polar 

 winter, as well as the storms of an Arctic sea. 



Your memorialists fear that the cause of the delay of the return of Dr. Kane 

 may arise from one of those acccidents so incident to Polar voyages, the crush- 

 ing and destruction of his vessel by the ice, in which case a relief expedition 

 can alone in all probability mitigate his destitution and distress, and save him. 



Your memorialists respectfully, but earnestly solicit that the earliest possi- 

 ble succour may be afforded to Dr. Kane and his companions. 



On motion, the Secretary was directed to prepare copies of the above, 

 to be signed by the officers of the Society and transmitted to Congress. 



On motion of Dr. Rand, the thanks of the Academy were presented 

 to Mr. Joseph Harrison, Jr., of this city, for his valuable donation of 

 portraits of Sir Joseph Banks and Dr. Samuel L. Mitchell, received this 

 evening.

Descriptions of three new species of Unio. 

 By T. A. Conrad. 



UNIO. 



1. 77. Grandensis. Suboval, ventricose posteriorly, disks somewhat flattened ; 

 umbo distant from anterior margin, and with minute radiating lines extending 

 to- the tips of the beaks ; no concentric undulations; within purple. 



Locality. Rio Grande, Texas. 



Allied to 77. cardium, Raf., but differs in the striated beak, purple interior, &c 



2. 77. Tanmilapanns . Oblong, somewhat compressed; substance of shell thick 

 anteriorly and over the umbo; disks flattened; ligament margin nearly parallel 

 with basal margin ; umbo decorticated ; within pure white. 



Allied to 77. niger, Raf., but more regularly oblong and very white inside. 

 Locality. San Juan river, Taumilapas. 



3. TJ. Pearlensis. Suboval ; umbo ventricose ; sides contracted before the 

 umbonal slope, which is ridged or inflated ; two or three radiating folds poste- 

 riorly, most prominent over the umbo ; within whitish, with a purple margin. 



Locality. Pearl river, Miss. Prof. Thomas. 



Allied to 77. crasside?is, Lam., {trapezoides, Lea,) but proportionally much 

 shorter, more ventricose over the umbones, and less folded. This shell belongs 

 to my proposed genus Plectomerus, which, if without sufficient distinction in the 

 animal to constitute a genus, will form a convenient and very natural subgenus.

Observations on the Eocene deposit of Jackson, Mississippi, with descriptions oj 

 thirty-four new species of shells and corals. 



By T. A. Conrad. 



The following table will show the order of succession of Eocene groups ; but 

 is not pretended to be more than an exposition of my limited knowledge of them, 

 though they are doubtless presented in the true order of superposition. Further 

 research may develope intercalated groups. No. 6, is probably synchronous with 

 the Orbitulite limestone of St. Stephens, Alabama, as its two most prominent 

 fossils are very abundant in this stratum at Vicksburg. No. 5, is the lowest bed 

 exposed in the bank of the Mississippi river, at Vicksburg. Col. Wailes found 

 a large Ostrea on the top of the Jackson group, which is probably the shell 

 referred to in No. 5. It would be convenient to designate these sub-divisions 

 thus: Claiborne group; Jackson group; Vicksburg group; St. Stephens group ;

Nos. 1 to 3 represent the Claiborne group; 4, Jackson group; 6, the St. 

 Stephens group ; 7 and 8, the Vicksburg group. When a group of corresponding 

 fossils is to be found elsewhere, its relative position can be stated by referring to 

 the typical subdivision which contains many identical species. 



Since my discovery of the Eocene formation of Claiborne, Alabama, in 1832, 

 by means of fossil shells collected by Judge Tait, numerous localities have been 

 found in the southern States, and characteristic fossils have also been obtained 

 by Major Emory, in Western Texas, and even in California, by Mr. Blake. 

 Localities widely separated contain some species in common, but I did not anti- 

 cipate that groups would vary to the extent they do in the three localities of 

 Claiborne, Alabama, Jackson and Vicksburg, Mississippi. Col. B. L. C. Wailes, 

 of Mississippi, has lately discovered a new group of Eocene fossils at Jackson, 

 in which none of the Vicksburg species occur ; and of forty species, five only 

 are identical with Claiborne fossils. One of the Jackson shells, Cardium Nicolletti, 

 Conrad, was first discovered in the bank of Red river, Washita ; and, therefore^ 

 this latter locality will probably prove to belong to the same division of the 

 Eocene as that of Jackson. The Mississippi deposit described by Col. Wailes, 

 is a group of shells chiefly, of more than ordinary beauty and preservation, 

 imbedded in sand of a gray color, consisting of fine angular grains of quartz and 

 minute fragments of shells. One of the species, Cyprcea fenestralis, is closely 




258 [January, 



related to C elegant, of Deshayes; two remarkable species which have no 

 analogue or kindred shell in later Tertiary formations. The state of preserva- 

 tion and the forms of these fossils are closely analogous to those of the Paris 

 basin"; and I find no recent nor any Miocene species among them. I believe the 

 group to be newer than the Claiborne deposit, and certainly older than that of 

 Vicksburg. 



I think it will be found that No. 6, of the above table, represents that exten- 

 sive limestone, which, in Alabama, contains the Basilosaurus remains ; the 

 Laganum Rogersi, Morton, near Claiborne, and near Brandon, Mississippi, where 

 it has been discovered by Col. Wailes, occupying a higher position than the Jack- 

 son group. The limestone of Jacksonboro', Georgia, described by Lyell, is pro- 

 bably referable to the same division, and contains the Laganum Rogersi, (Scu- 

 tella Jonesi, Forbes.) 







The following species of organic remains were collected by Col. B. L. C. 

 Wailes, and are figured in his work on the Geology of Mississippi. Those 

 illustrations are referred to in the descriptions. 



CORBULA. 



1. C. densata, Geol. of Miss. PI. xiv., fig. 9 Triangular, subequilateral, very 

 thick in substance ; surface undulated and having angular concentric striae; um- 

 bonal slope submarginal and acutely carinated, posterior extremity angular. 



Related to C. nasuta, Con. but proportionally shorter, thicker, with a more 

 rounded base, &c. The description applies to the larger valve, as I have not 

 seen the opposite one. 



2. C. licarinata, PI. xiv., fig. 3. Elevated, triangular, slightly oblique, thick 

 in substance, profoundly ventricose, with robust reflected concentric lines ; umbo 

 profoundly prominent, and the beak incurved; posterior slope biangulated ; space 

 between the angles flattened, direct. 



Resembles C. o?iiscus, Con., but is thicker, more elevated, not rostrated, and 

 its slight obliquity is the reverse of that in the former species. I have not seen 

 the smaller valve. 



LED A, Schum. 



L. multilineata, PI. xiv., fig. 4. Ovato-elliptical, inequilateral, ventricose, 

 with fine sharp concentric lines, which are somewhat undulated ; anterior side 

 rostrated, with closely-arranged, radiating, minute, tuberculated striae; posterior 

 side with unequal fine radiating lines, a few of which are very distinct; a few 

 radiating lines are continued near the base ever the middle of the valves. 



Allied to N. ccelata, Con., but very distinct. 



NAV1CULA, Blainville. 



N. atpera, PI. xiv., fig. 5. Trapezoidal, disk contracted behind the middle, 

 cancellated; concentric lines distant, imbricated ; radiating lines largest towards 

 the umbonal slope, subspinous ; umbonal slope acutely angulated ; posterior slope 

 excavated ; series of cardinal teeth uninterrupted ; inner margin crenulated. 



CARDIUM, Lin. 



C. (Protocardia) Nieolletti, PI. xiv., fig. 6. Proceed. Acad. Nat. Sc, 1841, p. 33. 



This shell agrees, except in size, with the specimen originally described from 

 the Washita, and doubtless the beds of that locality will prove to be of synchron- 

 ous origin with those of Jackson. A species of Cardium very nearly allied to 

 this, 1 formerly believed to be the same; but it accompanies a different group, 

 and presents variations entitling it to be a specific distinction. 



It is from Pamunkey river, Virg. 



Compared with C. Nieolletti ; umbo less inflated, posterior margin oblique, shell 

 proportionally longer, and the radiating lines 22; in the other 25. The posterior 

 cardinal tooth larger, &c. It may be named C. lene. 




1855.] 259 



CRASSATELLA, Lam. 



C. flezura, PI. xiv., fig. 7. Trapezoidal, inequilateral ; ventricose medially ; 

 slightly contracted anteriorly, and more so posteriorly ; umbonal slope angulated 

 and prominent ; whole surface with concentric prominent lines, some of which 

 bifurcate anteriorly; inner margin crenulated. 



Approaches C. protezta, Con., but has the strias over the whole disk, the car- 

 dinal teeth more compressed ; inner margin with larger crenulations, &c 



GLOSSUS. 



G. filosus, PI. xiv., fig. 8. Orbicular, ventricose, with radiating lines, unequal, 

 medially flattened, and towards the ends angulated ; concentric lines microscopic, 

 series of cardinal teeth uninterrupted, generally large and prominent. 



Allied to G. stamineus, Con., but very distinct. 



OSTREA, Lin. 



O. trigonalis, PI. xiv., fig. 10. Triangular, fiat, sui face irregular, withsome 

 indistinct radiating lines; muscular impression obliquely suboval, situated nearer 

 the summit than the base; margin somewhat ascending, submargin carinaced. 



A single imperfect upper valve is all that I have seen of this shell, but it is 

 widely different from any other Eocene species known to me. 



PECTEN, Lin. 



P. nuperus, PI. xiv., fig. 11. Suborbicular, ventricose, with about twenty- 

 three angular, prominent ribs, crossed by fine closely-arranged wrinkled lines; 

 ears finely striated obliquely. 



A single valve with the ears broken is all of this species in the collection. 



UMBRELLA. 



77. pla?iulata, PI. xiv, fig. 1. Suboval, flattened, surface undulated, rising a 

 little towards the apex, which is prominent and acute, and situated much nearer 

 to one side and nearer to one end ; lines of growth conspicuous; inner side with 

 a very large suboval cicatrix, with radiating interrupted lines. 



This fine species is the only one yet known in North America. Two speci- 

 mens occur, one of which is marked with some hair-like brown radiating lines, 

 both internally and externally. 



CAPULUS, Mont. 



C. Am-ericanus, PI. xv., fig. 1. Obliquely ovate, longitudinally contracted on 

 one side ; lines of growth profound ; summit very oblique ; apex profoundly 

 prominent, acute, curving towards the base and projecting far beyond the basal 

 margin ; aperture obtusely oval or suborbicular. 



TROCHITA, Schum. 



T. alta, PI. xv., fig. 3. Conic, elevated, with three or four transverse undu- 

 lations ; radii prominent, rounded, very irregular, interrupted, somewhat tuber- 

 culated; vertex central, spiral, somewhat prominent. 



CLAVELLA, Swains. CLAV1L1THES, Swains. 



1. C. humerosa, PI. xv., fig. 2. Fusiform, volutions eight? rounded; body 

 whorl and penultimate entire, the others with broad rounded ribs; whorls cari- 

 nated below the suture and with revolving lines, most prominent towards the 

 apex; body whorl and penultimate, channelled above and contracted near the 

 summit ; body whorl angulated inferiorly ; beak long and straight. 



2. C. varicosa, PI. xvi., fig. 7. Fusiform, spire and beak elongated; whorls 

 nine, with distant, rounded, thick ribs and with revolving acute lines, which are 

 obsolete or less prominent on the ventricose portion of the body w horl ; papillated 

 apex formed of three volutions; columella nearly straight, and with microscopic 



ongitudinal lines. 

 C. Mississippie?i$is, PI. xvii., fig. 8, is probably the same species. 




260 [January, 



MITRA, Eumph. Lam. 

 Subgemis Lapparia, Conrad. 



Short-fusiform, spinous; apex papillary; beak very short, thick, twisted; 

 plaits as in Mitra. 



M. (Lapparia,) dumosu, PI. xv., fig, 4. Short-fusiform, volutions seven, 

 direct, obliquely flattened above, with a series of transversely compressed, distant 

 spines on the two largest whorls ; on the contiguous whorl they become nodules ; 

 two whorls below the apex papillary, smooth ; the next two longitudinally ribbed, 

 and the others longitudinally striated or with prominent lines of growth; whole 

 surface with revolving wrinkled lines ; plaits four ; beak profoundly ridged. 



CONUS, Lin. 



C. tortilis, PI. xv., fig. 5. Ovato-turbinate ; spire obtusely conical with the 

 apex exserted, acute; whorls obliquely flattened, with revolving impressed lines 

 and transverse wrinkles, carinated near the base, direct between the carina and 

 suture; lines of growth on body whorl profoundly curved; base with a pro- 

 found thick fold. 



Differs from C. sanrodens, Con., in having a more prominent and convex spire, 

 in the large twisted callus at base, &c. 



ROSTELLARIA, Lam. 



1. R, velata, Con., PI. xv. fig. 7. R. Lamarckii, Lea, Cont. fig. 164. 



2. JR. slaminea, PI. xvi. fig. 9. Fusiform, spire elongated, subulate abo^e ; 

 whorls fifteen; body whorl slightly concave with fine closely-arranged revolving 

 lines, and obsolete longitudinal undulations ; three upper whorls with curved 

 longitudinal acute ribs; the remainder covered with a polished calcareous de- 

 posit, and excavated at the suture ; body whorl angular on a line with the upper 

 margin of the aperture; labrum thin ; beak slightly curved. 



This species occurs at Claiborne in great abundance. 



VOLUTALITHES, Swains. 



1. V. symmetrica ^YX. xv., fig. 8. Subfusiform ; with longitudinal acute ribs 

 terminating above in short spines on the body whorl ; volutions excavated above, 

 where they are striated but not ribbed ; body whorl with raised alternated revolv- 

 ing distinct lines; above the angle they become almost microscopic; suture 

 margined below by a series of small points, and somewhat carinated ; plaits 

 three, slender. 



Allied to V. Sayana, Con. 



NATICA, Lam. 



N. permunda, PI. xvi., fig. 2. Suborbicular ; body whorl somewhat excavated 

 near the suture ; spire very short ; umbilicus very long, profound, with a central 

 broad rounded ridge, and the lower margin subcarinated ; columella subrectilinear. 



APORRHAIS. 



Subgenus Platyoptera, Conrad. 



Shell with a profoundly expanded labrum which is entire, or without a rostrum, 

 and with the margin very thin and acute. 



A. (P.) eztenta, PI. xvi., fig. 3. Shell independent of labrum fusiform, with 

 prominent revolving rounded lines and intermediate fine lines, from one to three, 

 and longitudinal microscopic lines ; volutions rounded, covered towards the apex 

 with a polished calcareous deposit ; labrum within with impressed radiating 

 lines, becoming well marked furrows towards the base. 




1855.] 261 



MITRA. 



Subgenus Fusimitka, Conrad. 



Elongate-fusiform, smooth and polished with impressed revolving lines ; aper- 

 ture narrow ; plaits two prominent, and two obsolete, or much smaller than the 

 others; beak elongated. 



To this subgenus belongs M. conquisita, Con., M. Mississippiensis, and 

 Con., of the Vicksburg deposit. 



M. (Fusimitru) Mellivgtoni, PI. xvi. fig. 5. Profoundly elongated, fusiform; 

 volutions ten, convex, six of which towards the apex have revolving impressed 

 lines, with the interstices transversely striated; in the contiguous whorl they are 

 distant and obsolete, except near the summit, where there are two distinct im- 

 pressed lines ; on the penultimate whorl one distinct impressed line, and the 

 summit of the body whorl obtusely carinated; spire longer than the aperture, 

 which is narrow ; plaits four, the two superior ones very prominent, robust. 



Allied to M. conquisita s but much larger, proportionally longer, and with 

 the striae less deeply impressed. It may prove, however, to'be the same when 

 many specimens from the two localities can be compared. If it should be iden- 

 tical with the former it is the only species common to the Vicksburg and Jackson 

 deposits out of 40 species of the latter and 100 of the former deposit. 



CARICELLA, Con. 



1. C subangulata, PI. xv. fig. 8. Turbinate; labrum expanded ; shoulder 

 subangulated ; body whorl flattened above ; spire short, conical, consisting of 

 4 volutions, with microscopic revolving lines near the apex ; columella with 

 four remote plaits, the two inferior ones most oblique. 



2. C.polita, PI. xvi. fig. 4. Fusiform; smooth and polished, with revolving 

 lines inferiorly, and on two volutions of the spire ; the whorl above is papillary 

 and smooth ; columella with closely arranged microscopic longitudinal lines ; 

 plaits four, slender, prominent, remote ; beak slightly curved. 



Allied to C. but proportionally shorter and very distinct. 



SCALARIA, Lam. 



S. nassula, Con., PI. xvi. fig. 6. Foss. Shells of Tert. Form. 

 This shell, though much larger than the Claiborne specimens, specifically agrees 

 with them. Probably Lea's S. plamdata is the same species. 



ARCHITECTONICA, Bolton. SOLARIUM, Lam. 



1. A. acuta, PL xvii. fig. 1. Much depressed, very thin and acutely cari- 

 nated on the margin; convex above, lower half of the whorls somewhat exca- 

 vated ; revolving striae linear, crenulated, with a minute intermediate crenulated 

 line, and a still finer line or two in some of the interstices ; base convex, flattened 

 and somewhat excavated towards the periphery, revolving striae linear, alternated 

 with a medial smaller line and two minute ones, nearly smooth, except four 

 from the umbilical margin, which rapidly increase in size towards the inner 

 margin; the marginal line profoundly crenulated ; a carinated beaded line on the 

 middle of each whorl within the umbilicus, which is profoundly scalariform. 



2. A. bellastriata, PI. xvii. fig. 2. Discoida], with radiating impressed lines, 

 which frequently bifurcate and are most profound at the suture ; whorls of the 

 spire carinated below near the suture ; periphery acutely carinated, margined 

 above by two approximate raised lines, and below by a prominent line which is 

 slightly marked by a microscopic impressed line ; base with three impressed 

 lines, that nearest the umbilicus profound; radiating striae interrupted by the 

 revolving lines ; base convex towards the periphery and concave towards the 

 umbilicus. 




262 [January, 



GASTRIDIUM, Sow. 



G. vet/estum, Con., PI. xvii. fig 4. Proceed. Acad. Nat. Sc, vol. 6, p. 321. 



The Jackson specimens of this species, being more perfect than those of 

 Claiborne, Alabama, exhibit six or seven denticulations below the tooth on the 

 labrum, which denticle is very short ; the base of the shell is carinated, and an 

 acute carinated line runs within the umbilicus near the outer margin. 



CYPR^A, Lin. 



1. C.pinguis, PI. xvii., fig. 3. Obtusely ovate, rounded at base, but ob- 

 liquely flattened towards the aperture which is very narrow and denticulato- 

 striate on both sides; columella deeply indented near the base, and a dentate line 

 on the margin ; labrum excavated towards the base. 



Allied to C. spkcsroides. Con., of Vicksburg, but much less ventricose and 

 very distinct. 



Subgenus Cypr^edia, Swains. 



2. C.fenestralis, PI. xvii., fig. 5. Ovate, ventricose, decussated with acute, 

 prominent, distant lines, the transverse ones alternated in size; interstices with 

 microscopic lines parallel to the transverse ones ; aperture narrow, much curved 

 above ; columella with four or five plaits. 



This beautiful species is nearly allied to C. elegans, Desh.,but is much broader, 

 and has microscopic regular lines which are not mentioned in the description of 

 the former, and it is probably destitute of them. The plaits on the columella of 

 the Jackson shell are much larger than in its European relative. These two 

 shells are so different from any in the more recent formations that they appear 

 to be entitled to a generic distinction, and they are peculiar to the Eocene period. 



PHORUS, Mont. 



P. reclusug, PI. xvii., fig. 6. Trochiform ; whorls seven, obliquely flattened 

 on the sides; base flattened, slightly excavated near the periphery, striated ; 

 lines profoundly curved, wrinkled, acute, many of them minutely beaded ; base 

 partially covered with a polished calcareous deposit. 



GALEODIA, Link. CASSIDAR1A, Lam. 



G. Peterso7ii, PI. xvii., fig. 9. Obtusely ovate, spire short, scalariform ; body 

 whorl with three distant revolving lines much larger than the others, which are 

 alternated, suture margined by a prominent acute line; inferiorly three revolving 

 lines larger than the others ; lower whorl of the spire carinated in the middle ; 

 longitudinal wrinkled lines veiy fine: labrum margin thickened, somewhat re- 

 flected ; inner margin denticulato-striate, with a prominent tooth near the upper 

 extremity; labrum reflected ; columella striated, inferiorly tuberculato-striate. 



Approaches G. funiculosa {cassidaria) Desh., but very distinct. 



PAPlLLINA,Con. 



Pyriform ; shoulder angular and spinous ; beak long, with an obtuse fold on 

 the columella ; three volutions from the apex forming a papillated summit. 



P. Mlssisdppiensis, PI. xvii., fig. 10. Fusiform, with a series of distant, 

 very prominent spines and longitudinal undulations ; revolving lines prominent, 

 alternated, wrinkled and undulated ; three volutions from the apex entire, and 

 forming the papillary top; fold on the columella obtuse ; beak slightly tortuous. 



In the geology of Mississippi where the shell is figured, 1 have incorrrectly 

 referred it to the genus Clavelithes. To this genus Papillina belongs the Eocene 

 species, Fusics papillatu.s, Con., of Claiborne. I have never met with a species 

 of this genus in the Miocene or more recent formation. It is probably most 

 nearly related to Turbinella. 




1855.] 



263 



TURRITELLA, Lam. 



T. alveata, PI. xvii., fig. 7. Elongated; whorls about nineteen; revolving 

 lines prominent, about six in number alternated with a minute line ; volutions 

 excavated at base and minutely striated. 



Allied to T. obmta, Con., (T. litieata, Lea,) of Claiborne, but greatly more 

 elongated. 



Polyparia. 



ENDOPACHYS, Lonsdale. 



1. E. expansum. Cuneiform, dilated, much compressed on the sides ; middle 

 ventricose with two prominent ribs ; end margins straight, direct, obliquely trun-

 tapering towards the middle of the base, which is thickened, truncated and 

 rounded, medial elevation very wide, rounded, with two prominent ribs ; sides 

 excavated and suddenly compressed near the margins, which are acutej granu- 

 lations in form of radiating stria?. 



Locality. Occurs with the preceding. 



The sides between the ribs and the depression are convex, and when perfect 

 have probably a rib on the middle. 



3. E. alticost'itum. Cuneiform, subtriangular ; medial elevation tapering 

 gradually to the base, which is thick and irregularly rounded; ribs two, pro- 

 foundly elevated, compressed; lateral depressions profound, margins acute, ob- 

 lique ; suiface densely and minutely granulated; base truncated or obtusely 

 rounded. 



Locality. Claiborne, Alabama. 



FLABELLUM, Les. 



F. Wailesii. Triangular or cuneiform, concentrically somewhat undulated; 

 periphery irregularly subcarinated, sides plano-convex, subcostate, with im- 

 pressed radiating lines, many of them bifurcated; lamellae unequal, three smaller 

 between each of the larger ones ; sides with longitudinal tuberculated stria?. 



Locality. Jackson, Miss.

Form of Turbinolia ; transversely oval; lamellae numerous, anastomosing or 

 branched; centre composed of small, angular cells; submargin with similar 

 but smaller cells ; cellular or bone-like structure characterising the sides beneath 

 the surface.

 Turb. cyanthus, from near City Point, Virginia, in the older Eocene ; and T. 

 caulifera, newer Eocene, Vicksburg. 



O. irroratus. Conical, sometimes elongated, recurved, transversely oval ; 

 sides w r ith closely arranged, acute, prominent, densely-granulated striae; lamellae 

 numerous and finely granulated.

 lated ribs; lamellae numerous, unequal, finely granulated, three smaller between 

 the larger ones ; periphery profoundly indented by the prominence of the ribs. 



Locality. Occurs with the preceding.

 accompanying the donation from him acknowledged this evening. 



Dr. Le Conte presented a paper for publication in the Proceedings, 

 entitled " Synopsis of the Pyrochroides of the United States :" which 

 was referred to Mr. Guex, Dr. Zantzinger and Mr. Cooke. 



Mr. Cassin presented a paper for publication in the Proceedings en-

 this description of stragglers, the European Widgeon and the European 

 green-winged Teal most frequently occur, but no specimen of a land 

 bird had ever come under bis observation, the present specimen being 

 the nearest approach to it. This specimen he had been assured by Mr. 

 Patterson, who presents it this evening, was shot in the vicinity of 

 Salem, N. J., and was prepared by him from the recently killed bird.

 interrupted somewhat tubercular radii ; upper valve thin, radii obsolete or 

 wanting. Height l in. 



Locality. Colorado Desert. Dr. Heermann. Shell silicified. 



OSTREA, Lin. 



O. Heermanni. Very irregular in form, thick, ovate and subfalcate, often 

 dilated; lower valve shallow, the exterior very irregular, with large distant 

 angular radiating ribs, and with pits or cavities ; cartilage pit broad and oblique ; 

 upper valve flat or concave, with a profoundly irregular surface. Height 6 

 inches.

MERC EN ARIA, Schum. 



M. perlaminosa. Obliquely-cordate, very inequilateral, with numerous, pro- 

 minent, recurved, lamelliform, concentric ribs; lunule cordate, not deeply 

 impressed; posterior margin truncated, direct ; within purple from the pallial 

 impression to the base; margin finely crenulated. 



Locality. California. Dr. Heermann. 



Allied to M. Ducatellii, Con., of the New Jersey ?*Iioeene. 



PECTEN, Lin. 



P. Heermanni. Suborbicular, thin, compressed; ribs about 21, square, 

 smooth; ears moderate in size. 



Locality. California. Dr. Heermann. 



Allied to P. eboreus of the Virginia Miocene, but very distinct. Only two 

 inferior valves were obtained. They are slightly convex. 



DIADORA ; Gray. CEMORTA, Leach. 



C crucibuliformis. Oval; height about two-thirds of the length; apex, 

 central, curved towards the anterior margin; ribs 20 or 21, distant, narrow, 

 prominent ,* interstices with each a fine line. 



Locality. California. Dr. Heermann. 



Many authors adopt Leach's name for this genus, but I suppose it was unpub- 

 lished at the time Gray's appeared. 



PANDORA. 



P. bilirata. Oblong, very inequilateral, contracted anteriorly, convex me- 

 dially ; posterior side with two distant carinated lines towards the hinge margin 

 which is straight and not oblique; posterior extremity truncated. 



Locality. Occurs w.th the preceding. 



CARDITA. 



C. occidentalis. Subtriangular, equilateral? ventricose; ribs 15, rounded, 

 wider than the interstices, and regularly granulated by transverse lines.

 ROSTELLITES, Conrad. 



Univalve, elongated, with an expanded labium, and having numerous oblique 

 plaits on the columella. 



This genus is related to Apoorhais, but differs in having a plaited columella. 

 The entire shell or cast has never been obtained, and the outline cannot be 

 determined. 



Rostellites Texanus. Narrow, elongated, with a subulate spire; plaits 

 oblique, narrow, acute, largest above, and becoming obsolete towards the base; 

 whorls of the spire flattened on the sides. 



Locality. Eagle Pass. 



The description was made from a cast, with only traces of the shell remaining, 

 the substance of which appears to have been thick, A large portion of the flat- 

 tened columella remains. The cast is associated with Cardium congest um. 



TURRITELLA, Lam. 



Turritella irrorata. Slightly turrited, subulate, elongated ; whorls with four 

 to rive fine revolving unequal beaded lines on each, and an intermediate smooth 

 minute line. 



Locality. Between El Paso and Frontera ? 



This shell differs from T. seriatim-granulata, Roemer, in having much finer 

 lines and tubercles, and in having a smooth line between each of the beaded 

 ones. It is associated with Nodosaria occidentalism the very small Venus quiit- 

 quecosta, and the little Corbula occidentalis. It is imbedded in a highly fossil- 

 iferous, ferruginous, indurated clay, which appears to have been obtained from 

 the same bed with Cardium Texamtm. 



CAPRINA. 



1. Caprina planata. A fragment of one valve two feet or more in length, 

 and another smaller fragment represented in the figure. Flattened on one side 

 and convex on the other, a much compressed outline; the shell is very long and 

 narrow, falcate, fibrous, and distinctly exhibiting the small septa as they occur 

 in the genus Caprina. The cavities between the septa are lined with crystals 

 of carbonate of lime, and the shell is imbedded in white friable limestone 

 resembling chalk marl. 



Locality. Oak Creek, near Puercos. 



2. C. occidentalis. Falcate; flattened on the side of the outer curve, convex 

 on the opposite ; the other margins acutely rounded ; surface very obscurely 

 striated transversely; substance coarsely fibrous. 



Locality. Near the mouth of Puercos River, Texas. A. Schott. 

 The matrix of this shell resembles chalk marl.

Neithea occidentalism Ovato-triangular, angulated; lower valve inflated, 

 unequally ribbed and concentrically lined, lines very fine; large ribs five, 

 rounded and elevated; smaller ribs equal, two in number in each of the intervals 

 between the larger ribs, which latter have on each side a raised line or fine rib, 

 giving it a trifid character; right valve flat, subconcave. 



Pecten quadricostatus, var. Roemer. Kreid von Texas, p. 64, pi. 8, fig. 4. 



This species differs from N. guadricostata in having but two equal ribs 

 between the larger ones, whilst that species has three corresponding ribs, and 

 it is also proportionally a narrower or more elevated shell. There is quite as 

 much difference between the two as between N. qnadricostata and N. quinque- 

 costata,. 



MACTRA, Lin. 



Mactra Texana. Triangular, ventricose, subequilateral ; anterior extremity 

 subangulated and slightly produced, much above the line of the base, which is 

 regularly and profoundly curved; posterior margin obliquely truncated, ex- 

 tremity angulated ; anterior margin straight and very oblique ; umbo prominent. 



Locality. Prairie between Laredo and Rio Grande City, Texas. 



This species occurs only in casts, and is placed with doubt among the cre- 

 taceous fossils.

Synopsis of the Pyrochroides of the United States. 



By John L. Le Conte, M. D. 



The definition under which I include the native genera helow mentioned, 

 some of which have been widely separated by preceeding authors, may be thus 

 expressed. 



Coleoptera heteromera, capite postice coarctato, collo (Hstincto thoraci affixo; 

 oculis emar^inatis praecipue magnis ; abdomine articulis 5 vel 6 liberis, para- 

 pleuris parallelis; coxis anticis contiguis conicis, acetabulis postice imperfectis ; 

 tarsis articulo penultimo saepissime calceato vel emarginato, unguibus iam ad 

 basin dentatis, iam simplicibus, raro appendici basali elongata (sicut in Meloi- 

 dis pluribus) instructis. 



Thus the group differs from Anthicidae by the emarginate eyes and paral- 

 lel parapleural ; while dentate or appendiculate ungues are not found in that 

 family. 



In Lagriariae the anterior acetabula are closed posteriorly and the coxae are 

 small; the head too is hardly constricted. 



Our genera may be thus arranged : 



A. Collum crassum: tarsi articulo penultimo emarginato: ungues simplices : 



abdomen 5-articulatum. 

 Palpi maxillares articulo ultimo dilatato, triangulari Eurygenius Ferte 



Palpi maxillares articulo ultimo elongato, cultriformi Stereopalpus Ferte 



B. Collum tenue, tarsi articulo penultimo lobato, abdomen 5-articulatum, ar- 



ticulo lmo longiore: ungues dente magno armati. 

 Antennae articulis 3 ultimis maioribus, elongatis Macratria Newman

1, E. Wildii, niger breviter nigro-hispidus, capite thoraceque densissime 

 pubescentibus, hoc canaliculato, campanulato, latitudine non longiore, elytris 

 pube sordida subvittatis. Long. *42. 



Kentucky : a fine specimen of this species was recently given me by Mr. J. P. 

 Wild, of Baltimore, to whom I dedicate it with great pleasure, as a slight testi- 

 mony of my appreciation of his great energy and success in collecting similar 

 objects. 



Larger than the following species. The head and thorax are very densely 

 clothed with brownish grey hair, with scattered suberect black hairs, and are 

 confluently punctured : the former is finely channelled between the eyes. The 

 thorax is subcordate, not longer than wide, canaliculate, much rounded on the 

 sides before ihe middle, with the anterior constriction distinct. The ehtra are 

 one half wider than the thorax, densely and coarsely punctured, with short black 

 hairs proceeding from each puncture; they are irregularly mottled with dense 

 brownish grey pubescence, with four narrow blackish vittae on each. Beneath 

 densely covered with grayish hair.

Le Conte, Ann. Lye. of New York. 5, 152. 



Ichthydion\ murinum Hald. Proc. Acad. Nat. Sc. 1, 304. 



Georgia and Alabama, rare. Black, uniformily covered with ashy hair, and 

 with scattered short suberect bristles. Head and thorax confluently punctured, 

 channeled : the latter one third longer than wide, rounded on the sides before 

 the middle, very slightly narrowed behind; anterior constriction moderately 

 distinct ; elytra one half wider than the thorax, coarsely and densely punctured, 

 variegated with small spots of more dense ashy pubescence. 



Although Prof. Haldeman's description is long anterior to the date at which 

 the present genus was established, he unfortunately did not give any generic 

 character, and I was therefore compelled to change the name given by him. 



3. E. c o n s t r i c t u s , ater elongatus, cinereo-pubescens, longe griseo-his- 

 pidus, thorace campanulato, latitudine longiore, elytris guttis cinereo-pubes- 

 centibus variegatis. Long. 35 4. 



Le Conte, Ann. Lye. of New York, 5, 151. 



San Diego, California. Narrower than the preceding, covered both above 

 and beneath with ashy pubescence and long erect gray hairs : head and thorax 

 confiuenily punctured, not channeled : the latter is nearly one half longer than 

 wide, rounded on the sides anteriorly, a little narrowed behind, with the ante- 

 rior constriction very distinct. Elytra one half wirier than the thorax, densely 

 and coarsely punctured, variegated with spots of denser cinereous hair.

Michigan. Body dark brown, covered with fine cinereous pubescence : head 

 and thorax confluently punctured, black: the line between the eyes faint: thorax 

 scarcely wider than long, rounded on the sides anteriorly, then obliquely nar- 

 rowed to the base, slightly impressed each side at the middle : anterior constric- 

 tion short, distinct only at the sides : elytra wider than the thorax, coarsely 

 punctured, the punctures smaller towards the tip; light yellowish brown. Feet 

 reddish yellow : first joint of the antennae brown. 



3. S. guttatus, aeneo-niger, cinereo pubescens, thorace campanulato, sub- 

 tiliter canaliculato, latitudine vix longiore, elytris guttis cinereis variegatis. 

 Long. # 3. 



Two specimens found at Fort Laramie, in Nebraska territory. Black, slightly 

 bronzed, finely pubescent : head and thorax confluently punctured, the latter not 

 longer than wide, rounded on the sides in front, then obliquely slightly narrowed 

 to the base, finely canaliculate, with a slight impression each side at the middle : 

 anterior constriction short, deep. Elytra densely and coarsely punctured, one 

 half wider than the thorax, variegated with numerous small round spots of 

 dense whitish hair. 



Although colored like the species of the preceding genus, the palpi terminate 

 in a long cultiform joint.

Middle and Southern States ; common. Body covered with very dense serice- 

 ous yellowish hair. Head finely punctured, slightly convex, narrowed behind the 

 eyes, and subtruncate : mouth and oral organs yellow. Antennae with the sec- 

 ond joint scarcely longer than the third : the following to the 8th are equal ; 9th 

 and 10th fuscous, pale at the tip, nearly as long as the two preceding united: thorax 

 very little wider than the head, one half longer than wide, elliptical, margined 

 posteriorly, finely scabrous. Elytra striate with fine punctures : interstices very 

 finely scabrous. Legs varying from yellow to piceous ; the anterior pair usually 

 paler. The male has the 5th segment of the abdomen truncate, whereby the 

 6th becomes visible. In the female the 2nd segment is impressed transversely 

 each side. In both sexes the first segment is conspicuously longer. 



2. M. confusa, atra minus dense cinereo-pubescens, thorace elongato-ovato, 

 capite non latiore, elytris vix seriat impunctatis, antennarum articulis 3 ultimis 

 elongatis subaequalibus. Long. 18. 



Two males. Georgia. Darker colored than the preceding, with less dense 

 pubescence. Head finely and sparsely punctured, rounded posteriorly, with the 

 occipital impression longer than in M. murina. Mouth and its organs yellow ; 

 antennee with the 2nd joint scarcely shorter than the 3rd, 37 equal, 8th fuscous, 

 a little shorter than the 7th ; 9 11 fuscous, nearly twice as long as the 7th and 

 Sth united, nearly equal, the 11th being a little longer. Thorax densely sca- 

 brous, not wider than the head, nearly twice as long as wide, disc subelliptical, 

 a little narrowed behind, where it is margined. Elytra with punctures arranged 

 in indistinct series, interstices scarcely scabrous or punctured. Feet piceous; 

 base of anterior thighs rufous. First segment of abdomen hardly elongated. 



The discovery of this second species within our territory seems to confirm 

 the opinion of Ferte, that M. linearis Neivman, (Entom. Mag. 4, 377,) is dis- 

 tinct from M. murina, though the great carelessness with which Newman's de- 

 scriptions were made, should prevent us from placing reliance on them, in the 

 absence of any corroborating circumstances. Newman's figure does not show 

 the very strong basal margin of the thorax which exists in all the species of the 

 genus, and where a character so evident has been omitted, we are prepared to 

 expect any inaccuracy whatever, both in the outline and details of the figure.

One specimen from Lake Superior. Differs from the preceding by the more 

 distant eyes, the broader thorax and the more densely punctured elytra ; the 

 joints of the antennae, from the 3d to the 6th are triangular, and the following 

 are gradually more and more produced at the extremity. In D. concolor, the 

 6th joint is provided with a branch nearly as long as the seventh joint.

Xylophilus Eonelli. 



In this genus the third joint of all the tarsi is lobed beneath, and the fourth 

 joint of the two anterior pairs is very small, and received upon the third. The 

 proper place is still not well determined: among the Anthicides it cannot remain 

 on account of the emarginate eyes.

York county, Pennsylvania ; Messrs. Melsheimer & Ziegler. Although by 

 the curious structure of the antennae of the male this beautiful species differs 

 from all the others below described, I can find no characters sufficient to cause 

 it to be separated as a genus. The feet vary in color, being sometimes yellow, 

 with only the posterior thighs fuscous: the antennas of the female are yellow; 

 the bands of the elytra are sometimes confluent, so that the elytra appear black 

 with yellow spots. The head is wider than the thorax, and the elytra are elon- 

 gate parallel, truncate at base, and nearly twice as wide as the thorax.

 thickened externally, the joints from the 3d to the 10th gradually broader, the 

 outer ones being transverse : the 11th is larger, ovoid, and acute at tip. The 

 transverse black spot of the elytra is sometimes broken into two rounded dots.

One specimen, Illinois, Mr. Willcox. The joints of the antennae from the 3d 

 to the 10th are nearly equal, and oblong in form : the 2d is a little shorter : the 

 llth is as long as the two preceding united, but is not thicker: the tip is sorai- 

 what acute. The palpi are rufous. 



The form of the antennae recalls Tanarthrus (Lee.) among the Anthicidae, 

 but the eyes are deeply emarginate, as in the other species of Xylophilus. The 

 legs are unfortunately all broken off. 



Notes 071, North American Falconidce, with descriptions of new Species. 



By John Cassin. 



Since the time at which my Synopsis of the Falconida?, inhabiting America 

 north of Mexico, was published in the Proceedings of this Academy, (vi. p. 450. 

 December, 1853,) and since, too, the publication of a more extended Synopsis 

 in my Birds of California and Texas, several collections of high interest, contain- 

 ing numerous specimens of birds of this family have been made for account of 

 the Government, principally by parties that have been engaged in surveying 

 routes for a railroad to the Pacific Ocean. Various collections, containing birds 

 of this family have, also, since the periods alluded to, been received by this 

 Academy, in one of which from Greenland, there are specimens of Hierofalco of 

 apparently two species, being the only mature American birds of this genus that 

 I have ever seen. 



In the present paper, t propose to notice additional localities of previously 

 known species, with such other information as may have been derived from the 

 collections alluded to, forming, in some measure, a continuation of my Synopses 

 above cited. For an opportunity to examine the collections belonging to the 

 Government, I am indebted to the officers of the Smithsonian Institution, in 

 whose custody they are, and more particular descriptions and all information 

 acquired will be published in the Reports of the officers who commanded the 

 various expeditions. 



1. Falco nigriceps, Cassin, B. of Cal. and Texas, 1. p. 87, (Dec. 1853.) 

 The most mature specimen that has ever come under my notice, is in the 



collection made by J. G. Cooper, M. D., one of the naturalists attached to the 

 Hon. I. I. Stevens' Surveying party. It is labelled as having been obtained at 

 Shoalwater Bay, Washington Territory, March 23d, 1854. The entire upper parts 

 of the body are light bluish cinereous, with which color the head above is more 

 decidedly tinged, than in the specimens originally described by me. The throat 

 and neck in front are white, very faintly tinged with yellowish; other under 

 parts white tinged with ashy and with transverse narrow bars of brownish black, 

 (every feather having about six bars.) Frontal band pure white; under wing 

 coverts pure white with brownish black transverse bars. 



In this specimen, there is no trace of the pale yellowish red and circular black 

 spots of the under parts which have appeared in all other specimens that 1 have 

 seen. 



2. Falco polyagrus, Cassin, B. of Cal., and Texas, 1 p. 88, (Dec. 1S53.) 



pi. 16. 



Adult specimens of this bird are in the collection made by Dr.Kennerly, who 

 was attached to the surveying party under command of Lieut. A. W. Whipple, 

 U. S. A., in New Mexico ; also in those made by Dr. Cooper, of Gov. Stevens' 

 party in Washington Territory, by Lieut. W. P. Trowbridge, U. S. A., in Cali- 

 fornia, and by T. C. Henry, M. D., U. S. A., in New Mexico. 



The original descriptions are from female specimens. Those above alluded to 

 are all adults, and do not differ from my description and figure of the adult female 

 in any material point, except that a male in excellent plumage and condition 




278 [February, 



in Lieut. Whipple's collection is smaller. Its dimensions are as follows : Total 

 length 16 inches, wing 12i, tail 7 inches. The young male of this species is in 

 Dr. Henry's collection, and differs from the adult only in being somewhat darker 

 in color, though not so dark as the young female described by me as above. 



3. Htpotriorchjs femoralis, (Temm.) 



A fine specimen and the first ever noticed within the limits of the United 

 States, is in the collection made by Dr. A. L. Heermann, who was attached to 

 the surveying parties in charge of Lieuts. Williamson and Parke, U. S. A. It 

 is an adult in fine plumage, and precisely identical with the South American bird. 

 Jt was obtained in New Mexico.* 



4. Tinnunculus sparverius, (Linn.) 



Numerous specimens from various localities demonstrate that this species 

 inhabits the whole of western (as well as eastern) North America. Specimens 

 from Tamaulipas, Mexico, are in Lieut. Couch's collection ; from San Francisco, 

 California, in Lieut. Trowbridge's; from Utah Tenitory, in Lieut. Beckwith's ; 

 and from Milk River, a tributary of the Upper Missouri, in the collection of Dr. 

 George Suckley, attached to the party in charge of the Hon. 1. I. Stevens.

"Falco arcticus, Holboll." Label on specimens received from Europe. 



Adult. ^ White, under parts with a few longitudinal narrow stripes of brown. 

 Upper parts white, head and neck behind with longitudinal narrow stripes of 

 brown. Plumage of the back, wing coverts and shorter quills with irregular 

 confluent transverse bands, and large snbterminal hastate or bluntly sagittate spots 

 of ashy brown* Primary quills white with their tips brownish black, and with 

 irregular and imperfect transverse bars of black, confluent on the shafts of the 

 feathers. Tail white, with transverse bars of brownish black in some of the 

 outer feathers, only observable on their outer webs. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin,) about 24 inches, wing 16, tail 10 inches. 



Young. Entire upper plumage with the brown predominating, and of a lighter 

 shade than in the adult, and tinged with ashy; every feather edged with white, 

 and more or less barred and spotted with white, and pale reddish. The brown 

 color showing a tendency to form the bands and sagittate spots of the adult. 

 Under parts white, tinged with ashy, with longitudinal stripes of brown, widest 

 on the abdomen. Quills ashy brown, with transverse bands of white tinged with 

 pale fulvous, tail ashy brown, palest on the middle feathers, every feather edged 

 externally with white, and with imperfect transverse bands (or pairs of large 

 spots, ) of white. 



This fine species is nearly related to that next described, but can be distin- 

 guished by the different style of the brown marking of the upper parts. In the 

 present bird, the large subterminal sagittate or hastate spots are especially cha- 

 racteristic, and this character prevails also in the young bird. 



The nomenclature of this and the succeeding species is difficult to determine 

 on account of their similarity.

* In Lieut. Couch's collection there are specimens of the following species 

 from Mexico. 



1. Hypotriorchis columbarius, (Linn.) from the State of Tamaulipas. 



2. Hypotriorchis rufigularis, (Daudin.) from the State of New Leon. This 

 species has not yet been detected within the limits of the United States ; but as 

 1he State of New Leon is only separated from Texas by the Rio Grande, it will 

 very probably be found in the State last mentioned. 




18.35.] 279 



Adult 5 White, beneath with a few narrow longitudinal lines of dark brown, 

 most observable on the sides and flanks. Upper parts white, on the head and 

 neck behind with narrow longitudinal lines and stripes of dark brown. Plumage 

 of the back., upper wing coverts, and tertiaries white, with regular transverse 

 bands of ' broion,becomi ng somewhat crescent shaped on the scapulars and rnrnp, and 

 slightly acuminate on the shafts of the feathers. Primaries white, brownish- 

 black at their ends, and with imperfect, confluent, transverse bands of brown. 

 Tail white, with about twelve transverse bands of brown. 



Young. Entire upper plumage brown, with transverse bands of dull white, 

 generally interrupted and imperfect in the middle of the feather. Under parts 

 dull white, with numerous circular and irregular-shaped spots of dark brown, 

 largest on the sides, and disposed to form transverse bands on the tibiae and 

 flanks. Quills dark brown, with transverse bands of white tinged with fulvous 

 on their inner webs; tail dark brown with transverse bands of ashy white. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin) about 24 inches, wing I6,tail 10 inches. 



Specimens in the collection from Greenland are strictly identical with others 

 in the collection of the Academy which were presented by our distinguished 

 members, Messrs. Thomas B., and Edward Wilson, and carefully ascertainedto 

 be undoubted Iceland specimens by the latter gentleman. 



In the present species the entire upper parts are transversely and nearly regu- 

 larly barred with brown, and the under parts less spotted than in the preceding. 

 The young bird also presents the same character on the upper parts in some de- 

 gree, while the under parts are spotted and transversely striped only, and not 

 with the numerous longitudinal stripes of the young of the preceding. 



These two birds appear to be different species so far as I can judge from the 

 specimens before me, and are so regarded by nearly all modern authors. They 

 are, however, nearly related, and I am not without a suspicion of their identity.

11. Buteo borealis, (Gmelin). 



In the comparison of numerous specimens of adults and young from various 

 localities in Western North America, with others obtained in the vicinity of 

 Philadelphia, I have failed to detect any differences not consistent with specific 

 identity. There is in some specimens a greater extent of the brown color on 

 the breast, and a deeper shade of rufous on the abdomen and tibiae, than is usual 

 in eastern specimens, but I have found no character in the western bird that I 

 have not seen at some time in the other. In my Synopsis I have erroneously re- 

 garded this bird as Buteo Swainsonii, which I have reason to suppose, as will 

 appear in my notice of that species in the present paper, has also been done by 

 other writers. 



12. Buteo Bairdii, Hoy, Proc. Acad., Philada., vi. p. 452. 



The only specimen yet obtained in Western America is in the collection made 

 by Mr. Kreutzfeldt, who was attached to the party in charge of Lieut. E. G. 

 Beckwith, U. S. Army. It is very similar to the specimen regarded as the more 

 adult of the two described as above cited, but has the brown spots on the under 

 parts larger, and the tibiae transversely barred with dark brown, and tinged 




280 [February, 



with rufous. It is labelled as having been obtained on the Rio Grande, in the 

 territory of Utah. 



13. Buteo Swainsonii, Bonaparte. 



In the collection made by Mr. Kreutzfeldt, of Lieut. Beckwith's party, there 

 are three specimens undoubtedly of this species, and the first that I have ever 

 seen. 



This species is a typical Buteo, and though I cannot regard it as identical with 

 the European Buteo vulgaris, it is more nearly related to it than is any other 

 American species with which I am acquainted. Like that species, too, it pre- 

 sents a marked variation in the colors of different specimens, the present three 

 being all unlike each other in a considerable degree. One specimen is almost 

 exactly of the form, dimensions and colors as originally described and figured by 

 Mr. Swainson, in Fauna Boreali Americana, Birds p. 47, pi. 27, and stated by 

 him to have been made (both description and figure) from a male bird. On the 

 specimen described by Mr. Swainson, as a female, (in the work just mentioned, 

 p. 49,) I shall venture some observations below. 



The first and apparently most mature specimen is as follows : 



Bill wide at base, compressed towards the tip, edge of the upper mandible 

 lobed, cere large. Wing long, third quill longest, tail moderate, rather wide, 

 truncate, tarsus feathered in front for nearly half its length, naked behind, bare 

 portion presenting in front about twelve transverse scales, toes rather short, 

 claws strong. Entire upper parts dark brown, nearly black in the middle of 

 many feathers, and paler on their edges. Quills brownish black, with wide, 

 transverse bands of cinereous on their inner webs, becoming paler and nearly 

 pure white towards their bases. Tail brown* tinged with ashy, and having 

 transverse bands of a darker shade of brown, the subterminalof which is widest, 

 tip edged with white. Throat white, with longitudinal lines of dark brown, 

 neck before and breast ashy brown, some of the feathers edged with reddish. Other 

 under parts white, nearly pure on the under tail coverts, and strongly tinged, 

 and with transverse, irregular bars of rufous on the tibiae, abdomen with nume- 

 rous irregular and imperfect narrow Transverse bars of brown tinged with red- 

 dish. Under wing coverts white, with a few spots and transverse stripes of 

 brown. Bill dark slate color, tarsi and toes yellow. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin,) 2H inches, wing 16, tail 5 h, tarsus 2 

 inches. 



The second specimen has the upper parts as just described, but darker. 

 Throat white, faintly tinged with yellowish, (without stripes of brown,) breast 

 dark brown, {nearly black), and the other under parts pale rufous, darker on the 

 tibiae, and with transverse stripes of brown on all the under parts less numer- 

 ous than on the abdomen of the preceding specimen, and more irregular. Total 

 length (of skin) 20 inches, wing lSg, tail 81. 



The third specimen has the upper parts about the same shade of brown as 

 the first described above, but with the tail darker, and the transverse bands 

 more indistinct. Throat white, with a few longitudinal lines of black, \eck be- 

 fore and breast light rufous, some of the feathers ashy brown in the middle, 

 other under parts white nearly pure and unspotted on the lower part of the ab- 

 domen and on the under tail coverts, tinged with very pale reddish on the tibiae, 

 upper portion of abdomen and flanks nearly pure white with a few spots and 

 transverse bars of fulvous and dark brown. Total length (of skin) 20 inches, 

 wing \b\, tail 8 inches. 



In all these specimens the color of the neck before and of the breast, may 

 be said to form a wide uninterrupted transverse belt or band, and is a very con- 

 spicuous and apparently constant character. The sexes of these specimens are 

 not stated in the labels attached to them. 



The tail in the specimens above varies merely in shade of the same brown 

 color. In the first and apparently the most mature specimen, it is strongly 

 tinged with cinereous. There is no tendency to become red in the tail of either 

 specimen. 




1855.] 



281 



Although I have no doubt whatever that this is the species indicated by the 

 description of Mr. Swainson as above cited, my opinion is that it is the male 

 bird only to which this conclusion applies. 



The female described by Mr. Swainson does not appear to me to be of the 

 same species, but apparently is that of the Buteo borealis, in plumage not ma- 

 ture. A careful examination of the descriptions of the male and female here 

 alluded to, which are given by Mr. Swainson with his usual great accuracy, will 

 show some material points of difference. Of the male it is stated that " the 

 third quill feather is the longest, the fourth is nearly a quarter of an inch, and 

 the second an inch and a quarter shorter." Of the female < ( the third an d fourth 

 quill feathers are of equal length." Of the male " cere and legs yellowish," 

 of the female "the cere and legs have a bluish livid color." The last cha- 

 racter may, however, only indicate a young bird, and that the specimen was a 

 young bird, is further rendered probable by the statement that "the feathers 

 are more downy " than those of the male. The total length of the male is 

 given as 22 inches, that of the female 26 inches. All the measurements of the 

 female as given, and the description, apply to the immature Buteo borealis, es- 

 pecially to western specimens. 



The bird figured by Mr. Audubon as Falco buteo (B. of Am. pi. 372) is the 

 young bird of Buteo borealls and not the present species. European naturalists 

 generally have regarded this bird as either identical with that species, or as 

 nearly related to it, both of which conclusions are erroneous. 



14. Buteo calurus, nobis. 



Form. Similar in general form to Buteo azigur, tachardus and vulgaris. Bill 

 strong, edges of the upper mandible with distinct rounded lobes, wings long, 

 fifth quills slightly longest, tail moderate (or rather short). Tarsi feathered 

 in front for nearly half their length, naked behind, naked portion in front pre- 

 senting about ten transverse scales, claws large, strong, fully curved. 



Dimensions (Of skin) sex unknown. Total length about 21 inches, wing 



16, tail 9 inches. 



Colors. Tail bright rufous above, white at the base, every feather having 

 about eight irregular and imperfect transverse narrow bands and one wide sub- 

 terminal band of brownish black, beneath silky reddish white. Entire plu- 

 mage of the head, neck and body above and below dark brown, nearly black 

 on the back and abdomen and palest on the breast. Plumage of the upper parts 

 with partially concealed transverse bands of white, and of the under parts with 

 circular spots and transverse bands of the same (also partially concealed). 

 Quills dark brown, with a large portion of their inner webs white, banded and 

 mottled with pale ashy brown. Tibial feathers and under tail coverts trans- 

 versely barred with dark brown and pale rufous. 



Hob. New Mexico, discovered by T. Charlton Henry, M. D United States 

 Army. This new and very remarkable bird presents a combination of charac- 

 ters quite unusual in an American species, and it bears a greater resemblance 

 to a Northern African species, Buteo augur, Riippell, than to any other with 

 which I am acquainted. In some degree it also resembles my Buteo insignatus 

 (B. of Cal. and Texas i. p. 102, pi. 31), but is much larger, and presents various 

 other strong points of difference. The present bird would present to a casual 

 observer the appearance of the Black Hawk {Archibuteo savcti-johannis) with 

 the tail attached of the common red-tailed Buzzard (Buteo borealis), a combina- 

 tion hitherto unknown amongst American Falconidae, but which exists in the 

 African Buteo augur. 



The bird now described is in an extensive collection containing many inter- 

 esting and little known species, made by Dr. T. C. Henry of the United States 

 Army, whose exertions have continued unremitted for several years. It was 

 obtained in the vicinity of Fort Webster, New Mexico. 



15. Buteo elegans, nobis. 



Form. Generally similar to Buteo lineatus. Bill rather slender, edges of 




282 [February, 



the upper mandible with a rounded not well defkied lobe, wing moderate, fourth 

 quill longest, first quill short, tail moderate, wide, rounded. Tarsus feathered 

 in front slightly below the joint with the tibia, naked behind, naked portion in 

 front presenting about twelve transverse scales. 



Dimensions. Total length, adult male ? (of skin) about 19 inches, wing 13, 

 tail 8 inches. 



Colors. Adult, generally resembling those of Buteo lineatus. Throat dark 

 brown with white longitudinal lines. Entire under parts bright rufous, darker 

 and unspotted on the breast, lighter on the abdomen, tibiae and under tail cov- 

 erts and with transverse bands of pale reddish white ; the latter (white) purer 

 at the bases of the feathers. Abdomen, tibia? and under tail coverts uniformly 

 colored. 



Entire upper parts dark brown, feathers of the head and back edged with dark 

 rufous, upper coverts of the tail narrowly tipped with white. Shoulders dark 

 rufous, every feather with a narrow central stripe of dark brown, superior cov- 

 erts of the wings dark brown, edged on their inner webs with rufous and with 

 transverse stripes partially concealed, and circular spots of white, and tipped with 

 the same. Quills brownish black, primaries and secondaries with numerous 

 irregular transverse bands of white, running obliquely on their inner webs, all 

 the quills widely tipped with white. Tail brownish black, white at base, and 

 having four transverse bands of white and tipped with the same. Under wing 

 coverts rufous, barred with reddish white, uniform with the abdomen and under 

 tail coverts. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin) male ? 19 inches, wing 13, tail 81 inches. 



Young. Upper parts brown, plumage of the head edged with reddish white 

 and on the back with rufous, quills with their inner webs barred with white 

 and dark brown, the hands of the former (white) much the widest and narrowly 

 edged with rufous, all the quills narrowly tipped with white. Tail dark brown, 

 with four transverse bands of ashy white, purer on the inner webs and narrowly 

 tipped with white. Throat dark brown, with longitudinal narrow stripes of 

 white, other under parts dull yellowish white, every feather with wide trans- 

 verse and confluent bands of dark brown, and at its end a large arrow head of 

 the same color. These bands and sagittate spots giving the predominating color 

 (brown) to the breast and sides, but less numerous on the abdomen and under 

 tail coverts. Tibial feathers, inferior coverts of the wing and some feathers of 

 the shoulders pale rufous. Total length (of skin) 18 inches, wing 122, tail 8$ 

 inches. 



Ilab. California, (Dr. Heermann;) New Mexico, (Dr. Kennerly.) 



This bird, the adult and young of which are in a collection made by Dr. Heer- 

 mann, in California, and another )^oung specimen in Lieut. Whipple's collection, 

 bears a considerable resemblance to Buteo lineatus. The entire under parts are, 

 however, of a different red color, and continued to the abdomen and under tail 

 coverts. In the present species, this color is nearly a clear brick red; while in 

 B. lineatus, it is more of an orange color, and in the latter, the lower part of 

 the abdomen, and under coverts are nearly pure white in adult specimens. The 

 under parts in the young birds of the present species are entirely and strikingly 

 different from those of its relative mentioned. 



16. Buteo oxypterus, nobis. 



Form. About the size of Btoteo pennsylv aniens. (Wilson). Bill rather long 

 and compressed, edge of the upper mandible slightly waved in its outline, but 

 scarcely lobed ; wing long, third quill distinctly longest, tail rather short, legs 

 rather long, tarsus feathered in front for about one third of its length, naked 

 behind, and with its naked portion in front, presenting about fourteen narrow 

 transverse scales, claws large, strong, fully curved. 



Dimensioyis. Total length (of skin,) sex unknown, about 16 inches, wing 131, 

 tail 7 inches. 



Colors. (Young bird, sex unknown.) Entire plumage above dark brown? 

 nearly black on the back. Feathers of the head white at base and edged later- 

 ally with the same; many feathers of the upper parts of the body also white at 




1855.] 283 



their bases, and with partially concealed transverse bands of white, quills very 

 dark brown (nearly black,) with the inner webs dark cinereous barred with 

 brown, tail above ashy brown, all the feathers white at base, and having; about 

 ten transverse bands of dark brown, outer feathers (of the tail) ashy white on 

 their inner webs, tail beneath silky ashy white, with a bronzed yellowish olive 

 lustre. 



Behind and under the eye a stripe of rufous brown. Under parts pale yellow- 

 ish white, throat with lines and narrow stripes of brownish black, and on other 

 under parts every feather with a large lanceolate, circuiar or cordate spot of 

 dark brown, some feathers on the flanks and sides having also some irregular 

 transverse bands of the same color. Nearly all the feathers on the under parts 

 with lines of dark brown on their shafts. 



Quills with their inner webs on the under surface of the wing grayish or dark 

 ashy, and near the shafts with a bronzed olive lustre ; shafts white (on the under 

 surface.) Inferior wing coverts white with arrow heads of dark brown. Tibial 

 feathers yellowish white, tinged with rufous, and having irregular transverse bars 

 of dark brown. 



Adult, black? 



Hab. New Mexico. Discovered by T. Charlton Henry, M.D., U. S. Army. 



The specimen now described is the young of a species the adult of which is as 

 yet unknown. It is about the size of B. pennsylvanlcux^ with the wings and 

 legs much longer and the bill also somewhat longer. The colors, too, are dif- 

 ferent, and in the present bird the dark cinereous of the inner webs of the quills 

 and the bronzed or silky olive lustre on their inferior surfaces are especially re- 

 markable. The exposed edges and ends of some of the secondaries in the pre- 

 sent specimen have a distinct purple lustre. I suspect that the adult of this 

 bird is black. 



This bird is in the valuable collection made by T. C. Henry, M.D., U. S. 

 Army, and is from the vicinity of Fort Webster, New Mexico.

The Committee to which was referred a paper by Messrs. J. G. Nor- 

 wood and Henry Pratten, containing notices of Fossils trom the Carbon- 

 iferous series of the Western States, reported in favor of its publication 

 in the Journal. 



The Committee to which was referred a communication entitled " Re- 

 marks on the Cryptogamic Flora of the State of Georgia, by Prof. Julien 

 Deby," reported in favor of publication in the Journal. 



Dr. Leidy offered the following Preamble and Resolutions, which were 

 unanimously adopted. 



Whereas, Information has been received by this Academy, that a proposal 

 has been made to the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to change, 

 in several fundamental particulars, the system of administration adopted by said 

 Board ; 



And whereas, The relationships of this Academy to the cultivation of the 

 natural sciences in the United States and elsewhere, give to it a peculiar interest 

 in the employment of the means best suited to the most liberal promotion of those 

 sciences ; 



And whereas, Tt is the opinion of this Academy that, in view of the multi- 

 plied means which the zeal, enterprise and skill of the present.-age have furnished 

 and will continue to furnish, for the " increase and diffusion of knowledge among 

 men," it is eminently desirable that the special opportunities and aids rendered 

 practicable by the bequest of Mr. Smithson p shall be discreetly applied to such 

 important objects as are not likely to receive assistance from ordinary sources ; 



And whereas, Such application is to be guided rather by the relations which 

 the objects selected hold with important scientific generalizations, and with 

 the largest increments of scientific knowledge, than by considerations of mi- 

 nute or ephemeral utility ; 



And whereas, The plan of operations adopted by the Board of Regents is 

 believed by this Academy to be well adapted to promoting, in the largest as 

 well as the most practical sense, "the increase and diffusion of knowledge among 

 men;" and that it possesses the advantage of supplying, according to a compre- 

 hensive and philosophic anticipation, the wants of the age, without superfluous 

 intervention in cases in which other agencies will surely produce the desired 

 results without such intervention ; 



And whereas, The number, variety, and extent of the departments of know- 

 ledge, render it essential to the greatest usefulness of any plan of administration 

 of the Smithsonian fund, that it shall have the confidence of the persons upon 

 whose contributions its resources for good shall be mainly dependant ; and also 

 that it shall be maintained in operation consistently and without frequent change ; 



Therefore, Resolved, That this Academy, as at present advised, would deeply 

 regret any material alteration of the plan adopted by the Board of Regents ; 



Resolved, That, as an expression of the reasonable solicitude of this Academy, 

 and of the desire which its experience has occasioned for the continuance of 

 said plan, the President is hereby requested to forward a copy of the foregoing 

 preamble and resolutions to the Secretary of said Board.

Dr. Leidy read letters from Dr. Ruschenberger, dated Rio Janeiro, 



and Valparaiso , transmitting donations of objects of 



Natural History for the Museum, and giving some interesting information 

 relative to the state of Natural Science in Brazil. 



Dr. Le Conte mentioned that a female cat in his possession having 

 been impregnated by a male of the tailless variety of cat, found in the 

 Isle of Man, had produced in her first litter two kittens, one of which 

 had a tail of half the usual length, while the other was entirely desti- 

 tute of all caudal appendage ; by a subsequent impregnation the same 

 female brought forth three kittens, two of which were similar in form to 

 the mother, while the third resembled the father in the absence of a tail. 

 Another young female, impregnated by the same male, brought forth 

 in her first litter four kittens, in all of which the tail was completely 

 absent. Dr. Le Conte proposed from time to time to furnish the Acade- 

 my with the history of the increase of this interesting family, as it fur- 

 nished a very convenient method of determining whether the physical 

 characters of the male or female are most frequently transmitted to the off- 

 spring. Dr. Le Conte mentioned also that the existence of this curious 

 ecaudate variety of the domestic cat had not been sufficiently noticed 

 by naturalists ; and that even its existence was alluded to in very few r 

 of the works thus far published. A corresponding, or very nearly 

 similar variety was known in Japan, and, as already mentioned in the 

 letters from Dr. Ruschenberger read this evening, had been brought 

 thence by the Japan Expedition under Com. Perry, which had recently 

 returned. 



Mr. Band remarked relative to the specimen of Uranite, presented this 

 evening, that although not remarkable as a specimen of this rare mineral, 

 it was interesting as being from a new locality which is now thought to 

 be exhausted. He believed that there are but three other localities of 

 this mineral known in the United States. The specimen is from the 

 western side of the Schuylkill near the Fairmount dam ; this locality 

 was discovered some two years ago by his brother Theodore D. H. Band, 

 who procured' quite a quantity of the mineral before the locality was 

 exhausted. After analysis, he sent a description of the locality to the 

 American Journal of Science and Arts. It was not noticed in that 




1855.] 287 



Journal, but in the last edition of Dana's Mineralogy the locality was 

 given, but without credit.

Mr. Isaac Lea read a letter from Dr. Deane, of Greenfield, Massachu- 

 setts, accompanying a photographic impression of some footprints in 

 sandstone, specimens of which he desires to dispose of. 



Mr. Cassin read a letter from Capt. F. Bernsee, of the Ship Cou- 

 rier, wrecked on the S. W. point of East Falkland Island, in April, 

 1854, of which the following is an extract. 



" The next morning when we found ourselves homeless and houseless, as well 

 as reduced to poverty, we commenced looking round for something to eat. In 

 this we had no trouble, for game and birds (of the kind I send you) weie more 

 abundant than I had ever seen them before ; and as few human beings had ever 

 trod that part of the Island, they were fearless and would come up to look at us ; 

 and we could get any quantity by knocking them down with sticks and stones. 

 The wolves, of which there were but few, would also come to look at us; 

 and would take a duck from one of our hands, while with the other we would 

 knock them on the head with a stick. I seldom saw more than one of them at a 

 time. Some wolves were caught alive by swinging a small line with a stone 

 tied to the end of it round and round the head with force, and when the wolf 

 would come for a duck or a goose which another man would shake at him, we 

 would let the stone with the line swing round his legs, and tangle him up so that 

 we could secure him. At one time we had six, ail caught in that manner, and 

 tied in different places around our tent, which we had fixed as a shelter from 

 wind, snow and rain, for winter was coming on. During the time we bad these 

 wolves prisoners, some fifteen or twenty would visit them at night, and make a 

 strange noise that would sometimes sound like the bark of a dog, and then 

 change to a snarl and a howl. They would get quite tame in two or three 

 days, but not sufficiently so to let them go loose ; they, however, would not bite 

 when we put our finders in their mouths, or threw them across our shoulders 

 and carried them like a dog. They appeared to be very playful, as those that 

 were not caught would come up in the daytime and have great times with our 

 dog ; but his courage generally failed him and he Avould run off and come up to 

 the men. They burrow in the sand hills : and I often found two or three open- 

 ings, which led through long channels underground to their kennel. They feed 

 chiefly on the large-sized geese sent you, as I have reason to believe from the 

 great number of wings, feet, and feathers I found. These wolves I found to be 

 very short-winded. They do not run even short distances with great speed; and 

 my sailors would often outrun them, when they would all at once turn short 

 round, and give up, blowing heavily with the tongue hanging far out of the 

 mouth, and then make the same noise as above stated. But they would never 

 make at us or show fight, but stand still and show their teeth. 




288 [April, 



"The large sized-goose is called by the inhabitants of the Island whom we 

 found six weeks afterwards, the upland goose ; the white one is the male ; these 

 birds are there in great numbers, but are seldom seen in large flocks ; I never saw 

 more than from twelve to twenty, but even in these flocks they will pair off and go 

 two by two at short distances from each other. They are oftener found in pairs en- 

 tirely separated from other geese. I found them away from salt water, and near 

 fresh water ponds. They live principally on a moss that grows there. In sum- 

 mer they lose all their feathers, and then as a matter of course cannot fly ; they 

 therefore keep constantly afloat in these ponds until their feathers grow out; I 

 watched these birds very closely during my stay. I found their habits very much 

 like other tame geese. Their meat is excellent eating, and not so dark as our 

 wild goose. In Patagonia and along the S. E. coast of Soutb America, th^y are 

 also found ; but there they are shy, and difficult to approach within gunshot. 

 Strange to say 1 have never met them on the west coast of South America in the 

 same latitude. 



" The next goose in size is the Kelp goose. The black breasted one is the 

 female ; the pure w^hite, the male. These birds I never saw but in pairs, and 

 never away from the salt water. Their meat is hardly eatable. They are very 

 tame, and live principally among rocks and kelp. The young all look like the 

 female, but the young males afterwards change their feaihersand become white 



" Of the small-sized goose, or the third kind, I shall make but few remarks, 

 as thfir habits are precisely like those of the upland goose. The inhabitants 

 call them the Poran goose. The male and female are alike. They are not 

 near so plenty as the upland goose. They, as well as the kelp goose, are found 

 around Cape Horn, and on the Island of Terra del Fuego. 



" Another bird sent you, of a white color, is, both while flying and walking 

 on the rocks, so like the common domestic pigeon, that it is difficult to tell them 

 apart. Although not w 7 eb-footed, they fly at times great distances from the 

 shore; I never saw more than six or eight together, and generally single. They 

 feed on worms and insects which they pick from the cracks in the rocks, after 

 the tide has fallen. They are called Rock pigeons. 



" Another bird, of which I saw plenty, a kind of Oyster-catcher, is black, with 

 a white breast, a long compressed bill, and long red legs. These birds gene- 

 rally go along the beach in pairs ; and give warning of danger by a long shrill 

 whistle. 



" Another specimen is a bird precisely like the last in habits, but wholly 

 black. I did not find many of them on the Falkland Islands. 



" I found a great many rats and mice on these Islands. Whether they are 

 different from our own or not I am unable to say ; their general habits are the 

 same. The mice, however, I think are smaller than ours ; and the legs of the 

 rats are of a red-flesh color, and almost hairless above the knee joint." 



[Note. The wolf, whose habits are well sketched in the above letter, is Canis 

 antarcticus, Shaw; the upland goose, Bernicla antarctica, Mellon ; the kelp goose, 

 Bernicla magellanica, Mellon ; the small-sized goose, Bernicla inornata, King; 

 rock pigeon, Chionis alba, Foi ster ; the oyster-catcher with white breast, Haema- 

 topus pailiatus, Terara.; the black oyster catcher, Haematopus ater, Vieill.J 



Dr. Genth presented a paper for publication in the Proceedings, en- 

 titled, " Analysis of the Meteoric Iron, from Tucson, Province of So- 

 nora, Mexico." Referred to Dr. Le Conte, Dr. Bridges, and Dr. Wethe- 

 rill. 



Dr. Le Conte desired to call the attention of the members of the 

 Academy to some very grievous misrepresentations contained in the 

 'Catalogue des Larves des Coleopteres', by MM. Chapuis and Candeze, 

 published in the eighth volume of the Memoirs of the Societe Hoyale 

 des Sciences de Liege. The portion he complained of was the article 

 -on the larva of Eurypalpus, (pp. 155-157), which purported to be, and 




1855.] 289 



was in reality, a literal translation of the account printed by him in the 

 work on Like Superior by Professor Agassiz, with the single exception, 

 that in every place where Dr. Le C<>ntu had taken occasion to mention 

 and criticise the erroneous views of Dr. De Kay regarding this curious 

 larva, the Belgian naturalists had substituted the name of Dr. Harris 

 for that of Dr. De Kay. This error was the more unaccountable, since in 

 Dr. Le Conte's original description, he had mentioned the name of Dr. 

 Harris but once, and then for the purpose of publicly expressing his ac- 

 knowledgements for some hints kindly given towards the true nature of 

 the larva in question, as well as for other valuable information, which 

 the well known accuracy of observation of Dr. Harris had enabled him 

 to give on various occasions, and which his liberal disposition prompts 

 him ahvays to offer for the use of his scientific colleagues. Dr. 

 LeConte concluded by expressing ardent wishes that foreign natu- 

 ralists, who seem but lately to have become familiar with works of science 

 published in America, would do our authors the justice, when they 

 quote, to quote correctly. 



Mr. Cassin called attention to the specimens of Cards Antarcticus, 

 and of the several species of Geese and other Birds, from the Falkland 

 Islands, alluded to in the letter of Capt. Bernsee, read this evening. 



On leave granted, Dr. Wistar offered a Resolution, which was unani- 

 mously adopted, inviting the members of the American Medical Asso- 

 ciation to visit the Museum of the Academy, during the session of that 

 body in this city, in May next.

The following species are not included in the above list, as I have not had 

 specimens for examination : 



From Russian America ; 74, H. griseo-striatus De Geer ; 75, H. ob?ongus Aube ; 

 76, H. humeralis Aube; 77, H. contractulus Mannh. ; 78, H. ruficapillus Mannh. ;

 to H cataseopium Say. Nos. 78 81 are described in the Bull. Moss, for 1852, 

 pp. 304, 305. 



From Atlantic America; 81, H. aulicus Aube; 82, H. nigro-lineatus Steph. 

 (fide Kirby, Fauna Bor. Am. 66); 



\ 1. Synonyms and Doubtful Species. 



H. laevis Kirby, is possibly a variety of H. 12-lineatus Lee, and according to 

 Mr. White, (Cat. British Museum,) is H. alpinus Paykull. 



H. ruficeps Aube seems not sufficiently distinct from H. modestus Aube. 



H. limbalis Mels. is probably the female of No. 53, H. oblitus Aube, with which, 

 according to a typical specimen, H. luridipennis Mels. is identical. 



H. discicollis Say, according to Dr. Harris, is H. dichrous Mels., but the des- 

 cription is very unsatisfactory, and I have been compelled to regard it as inde- 

 terminate. 



H. interruptus and H. parallelus Say, are not different from H. catascopium. 



H. hirtellus Lee, is smaller and more pubescent than H. subpubescens Lee. 

 but is probably only the female of that species. 



H. fasciatus Harris (S. Engl. Farmer, ^ec, 1828) is H. undulatus Say ; the 

 male is H. pubipennis, and the female H. velutinus Aube ; for a typical specimen 

 I am indebted to Dr. Harris. 



H. proximus Aube is probably H. oppositus Say, (vide infra No. 27.) 



H. punctatissimus Aube is H. niger Say. 



H. pulicarius Aube is H. lacustris Say. 



H. nanus Aube is H. affinis Say ; for a type I return my thanks to Dr. Harris. 



Hygrotus pustulatus Mels. is H. cuspidatus. 



H. humeralis|| Lee. is now H. axillaris Zee. 



E. luridipennis|| Le". Agassiz' Lake Superior, 216, is now H. lutulentus Lee. 

 (No. 50 1 .) Farther investigation, aided by more extensive series of specimens, 

 may show the necessity of uniting with it H. tenebrosus, from which it differs 

 principally in color. 



$ 2. Descriptions and Notes. 



1. H. f a r c t u s breviter ovalis, postice subacutus, ferrugineus glaber, capite

 Long. -10. 



One specimen from Massachusetts was presented to me by Dr. C. Zimmermann. 

 A little less globose than H. cuspidatus, and readily distinguished by the 

 finer and denser punctuation, and by the epistoma being without a margin. 



6. H. a car o ides, breviter ovalis, postice acutus, parum convexus, ferru- 

 gineus dense suhtilius punctatus, thorace margine basali nigricaate, elytris cos- 

 tula laterali parum elevata ad medium abbreviata, alteraque externa fere obsoleta; 

 sutura, macula magna communi ad medium, alterisque utrinque tribus nigris ; 

 postpectore abdomineque nigro-piceis, segmentis duobus ultimis ferrugineis. 

 Long. -10. 



Illinois., Mr. Willcox ; Kentucky, Mr. Wild. The elevated lines of the elytra are 

 very slight, but may be distinctly traced ; behind them, but apparently in con- 

 tinuation, is a linear brownish cloud which continues to the apex, outside of the 

 three discoidal spots, which surround the large subquadrate common spot at the 

 middle of the elytra. The spots are sometimes extended and become more or 

 less confluent. In H. latissimus the elevated line is very short, so that it appears 

 rather like a fold, limited externally by a moderately deep oblong fovea. 



8. H. granum, breviter ovalis utrinque attenuatus, subconvexus, piceo-tes- 

 taceus nitidus glaber, capite subtiliter marginato, thorace parce punctulato, 

 lateribus rectis subtiliter marginatis, elytris subtiliter parce punctulatis. Long. 

 05. 



One specimen from Louisiana given me by Mr. Guex. Smaller and more con- 

 vex than H. convexus, which it very closely resembles ; the sides of the thorax 

 are, however, not broadly rounded as in that species, and the punctures of the 

 elytra are much smaller and more distant. 



Desmopacbria ni ti d a Babington (Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond. 3, 17, tab. 1, fig. 5) 

 does not appear by its specific characters to be different from H. convexus Aube. 

 The generic characters agree accurately, except, that the posterior tarsi are not 

 four-jointed. This, if true, would be so anomalous, that the correctness of the 

 observer may well be doubted ; nevertheless, in H. convexus the posterior tarsi 

 are more flattened and more gradually attenuated than in the other species of 

 the genus, and therefore the terminal joints are more closely connected ; should 

 the specimen have been mounted in the clumsy manner in which small species 

 are frequently preserved, the articulation might be readily obscured by gum, in 

 such manner as to be overlooked. The claws of the hind feet of the species 

 under consideration are more slender and more bristle-like than in H. cuspi- 

 datus and allies. 



8 1 . H. exiguus Aube. Unknown to me. Said by Erichson (Bericht &c in 

 Wiegm. Arch. 1842, 2, 209) to have as a synonym Anodocheilns maculatus 

 Babington (loc. cit.) from South America. The genus Anodocheilus is described 

 as differing from Hydroporus, in having no tooth at the middle of the emargina- 

 tion of the mentum. 



12. H. pull us, oblongus, po3tice vix acutus, flavo-testaceus nitidus glaber, 

 capite vix punctulato, thorace parce punctulato, basi ad medium nigro-marginata, 

 striola obliqua utrinque notata in elytris brevissime continuata, his distinctius 

 punctatis, sutura vittisque utrinque tribus nigro-piceis, prima antice abbreviata 

 et secunda approximates, stria solita punctorum interna magis distincta. Long. 

 06. 



Louisiana; discovered by Dr. Schaum, to whom I am indebted for specimens. 

 The vittac of the elytra are quite narrow, the second one is confluent with the 

 dark colored suture at the base : all thevittas extend nearly to the tip; the under 

 surface is of a uniform honey yellow color. The faint impressed discoidal line 

 of punctures of the elytra, which may be traced in all the species, is here more 

 distinct than usual and runs along the second vitta. 



17. H. inconspicuus, oblongus, postice subacutus, flavo-testaceus, sub- 

 tiliter pubescens, thorace postice punctulato, basi nigricante, striola utrinque

Mas elytris confertim subtiliter punctatis nitidis ; femina elytris alutaceo-stri- 

 gosis opacis. 



Louisiana; for this very interesting species I am indebted to my friend Dr. 

 Schaum. The pubescence will distinguish it from the other species, having a 

 basal stria common to the thorax and elytra. The sides of the thorax are slightly 

 rounded, and form with the elytra a scarcely perceptible angle. 



19. H. f la vie o 1 1 is, oblongo-ovatus, postice subacutus, flavo-testaceus, sub- 

 tiliter pubescens, thorace subtiliter punciulato, margine basali nigricante. striola 

 utrinque brevissima notato, in elytris haud continuata, his piceis, margine fasciis 

 duabus (anteriore interrupta) apiceque testaceis. Long. -05. 



Ne.w York? given me by Mr. Willcox. The sides of the thorax are rounded, 

 and form a moderately distinct, but very obtuse angle, with the elytra; the an- 

 terior fascia of the latter is one-third from the base, and consists of a marginal 

 spot and a smaller discoidal one ; the second band is at one-third from the tip, 

 and is straight and regular, extending nearly to the suture ; the elytra in the 

 only two specimens seen are moderately shining, finely and very densely punc- 

 tured, but probably vary according to sex. 



20. H. 12-1 i n e a t u s, appears allied to H. alpinus and other European species. 

 The female resembles closely the figure of H. bidentatus (Aube, Col. Eur. 5, pi. 

 28.) H. laevis Kirby appears to be the same, but he states that no punctures are 

 visible on the upper surface of the body. In comparison with H. alpinus, our 

 species is a little narrower, and the sides of the thorax are less curved anteriorly. 



21. H. scitulus, oblongus, postice subacutus parum convexus, niger subni- 

 tidus glaber, capite thoraceque testaceis, punctulatis, punctis maioribus sparsis 

 intermixtis, hoc versus latera utrinque impresso ad basin transversim subdepresso, 

 margine apicali et basali nigricante, disco fasciis duabus subinterruptis extror- 

 sum connexis ornato, elytris margine basali ad humeros dilatata, laterali 

 lineolisque pluribus flavo-testaceis ornatis, parce punctatis, utrinque fortius bi- 

 seriatim punctatis, pedibus piceo-testaceis. Long. -13. 



One specimen, Eagle Harbor, Lake Superior. Allied to H. septentrionalis of 

 Europe, but more acute posteriorly, much darker colored above, more coarsely 

 punctured, and with the two punctured lines of the elytra distinct. The thorax 

 is broadly rounded on the sides, and forms a distinct angle with the elytra. 



22 H. st ri a t el lus, varies in color from the black type, with indistinct 

 testaceous elytral markings to dull muddy testaceous, with short lines on the 

 elytra, two discoidal thoracic spots, and the sides of the head fuscous. The under 

 suiface is black, and the feet dull testaceous, with the posterior tbighs dark. 

 The impressed striae of the elytra are four on each, and are usually deep, but are 

 sometimes shallow, though always distinct. It is found at San Francisco and 

 San Diego, in California, and at Sinta Fe in New Mexico. 



23. H. venustus, ovalis convexus, postice attenuatus, confertim subtiliter 

 punctatus, pubescens, ferrugineus, clypeo ad apicem late truncato, lateribus ob- 

 liquis, thorace versus angulos postico3 vage impresso, elytris atris, ad medium 

 paulo latioribus ad apicem oblique subtruncatis, margine fasciis duabus undu- 

 latls, maculaque versus apicem testaceis. Long. -17. 



One specimen from North Carolina given me by Mr. Zimmermann. Very dis- 

 tinct from all others by the hemi-hexagonal form of the clypeus, which is oblique 

 each side, and truncate at the apex, with the angles well marked, and the edge 

 very slightly reflexed. Head and thorax densely finely punctured ; the latter 

 slightly rounded and distinctly margined on the sides; posterior angles rectan- 

 gular, broadly vaguely impressed ; the sides make a very obtuse, not very per- 

 ceptible angle with the elytra. These are black, densely punctured, finely pubes- 

 cent, moderately convex, broadest about the middle, then narrowed to the apex, 

 which is obliquely truncate ; the whole margin, two undulated fasciae not 




296 [April, 



reaching to the suture, and an angulated spot at the apex (as in H. undulatus) 

 yellow. Body beneath rufo-testaceous, coarsely densely punctured. 



27. H. o p p o s i t us Say ; III. prozimus Aube. The length given by Aube is 

 rather less than that of any specimen seen by me ; the species is very similar to 

 the preceding, and seems distinguished principally by the margin of the thorax 

 being a little broader, with the anterior angles not porrected ; the general form 

 is more obtuse anteriorly, and the color is usually darker, so much so that the 

 fascia? of the elytra are at times hardly visible. The punctures of the eljtra of 

 the female are more distinct than in H. undulatus. 



29. H. spurius, ovalis, postice magis attenuatus, ferrugineus, pubescens, 

 capite suhtiliter punctulato haud marginato, thorace confertim punctulato, mar- 

 gine bisali nigricante, lateribus raarginatis cum elytris angulum haud forman- 

 tibus, his (maris) confertim subtiliua punctatis striis versus suturam2 vel 3 punc- 

 tatis parum impressis ; nigris, margine fasciis duabus undulatis, apiceque testaceis. 

 Long. -18. 



One male, from Vermont, was kindly given me by Dr. Harris. This species 

 closely resembles in form, sculpture and color, H. oppositus, but the 

 epistoma is not margined. From H. sericeus it is distinguished by its less 

 elliptical and less convex form, and by the large lateral spot behind the humerus 

 not being produced so as nearly to unite the two yellow bands which are also 

 in that species broken up into a series of linear spots hardly connected together. 

 The male is also less finely punctured than the male of H. sericeus. 



30. H. m i x t u s, longior ovalis, postice magis attenuatus, ferrugineus subtiliter 

 pcrce pubescens, capite subtiliter punctulato, vix obsoletissime late marginato, 

 thorace minus dense subtilius punctato, apice et basi vix nigricante, lateribus 

 fortius marginatis, elytris parcius minus s&btiliter punctatis stria suturali punc- 

 tata, nigris margine fasciis undulatis duabus interrupiis apiceque testaceis. 

 Long. -17. 



One male from Nebraska. Longer and more pointed posteriorly than H. un- 

 dulatus, with only a very faint transverse line representing the margin which in 

 that species is quite distinct. The anterior angles of the thorax are not por- 

 rected, and the punctures of the elytra are larger and more distant. 



32. H. s e m i r u f u s, rufo-testaceus parum convexus ovalis postice at'enuatus, 

 confertissime subtiliter punctulatus, breviter pubescens, capite punctulato, tho- 

 race latius marginato, cum elytris angulum vix formante, his lineolis quatuor 

 sutura margine basali macula postica alterisque duabus submarginalibus con- 

 fluentibus nigris. Long. -16. 



Fort Laramie, Nebraska. The first of the lateral spots is placed about the 

 middle, and is frequently not connected with the others ; the second spot is about 

 one-fourth from the apex, and internally is usually connected with the common 

 sutural black spot near the apex. The four discoidal lines are more or less con- 

 fluent, and are gradually shorter externally ; the outer ones are connected with 

 a short black basal margin. 



33. H. 1 i n eo 1 a tu s, longior ovalis, postice attenuatus, rufo-testaceus sub- 

 tiliter pubescens, capite subtilissime, thorace subtiliter parce punctulato, hoc 

 lateribus tenuiter marginatis, cum elytris angulum haud formantibus, margine 

 basali nigricante, elytris subtiliter punctulatis, sutura vittisque angustis utrinque 

 quatuor plus minusve confluentibus, maculisque externis duabus angustis nigris. 

 Long. -08. 



Illinois ; Mr. Willcox. The second and fourth black lines of the elytra reach 

 the base ; the first and third are abbreviated anteriorly ; the two outer spots are 

 narrow, as if formed by the interruption of a fifth line, of which a trace is some- 

 times seen on the humerus in the form of a dusky dot. Between the suture and 

 first line is sometimes seen a very slender black line. 



34. H. v i 1 1 a t u s, ovalis, subconvexus, postice suba'tenuatus, rufo-testaceus 

 parce pubescens, capite postice punctulato, thorace punctulato, apice et basi 




1855.] 297 



nigricante, lateribus marginatis, cum elytris angulum haud formantibus, his 

 punctulatis nigris, vittis duabus margine apiceque flavo-testaceis, vitta externa 

 ad humerum cum margine confluente. Long. -16. 



Fort Laramie, Nebraska. The form of body is exactly that of H. undulatus, 

 and the epistoma is very obsoletely transversely impressed, as in H. mixtus 

 above mentioned, but cannot be said to be margined. The inner vitta of the 

 elytra does not reach the base, but be ids a little outwards at its extremity; to- 

 wards the tip it is nearly confluent with the apical spot ; the outer vitta com- 

 mences at the humerus, where it is confluent with the margin, and ends at nearly 

 one-fourth from the tip ; in or e specimen it is also confluent with the margin at 

 its posterior extremity. The punctuation is a'ike in all the specimens seen, but 

 it is quite likely that the females are more finely punctured, less shining and 

 more pubescent. 



35. H. vi ti o su s, ovalis, longior parum convexus, subtilissime punctulatus 

 postice subattenuatus, subtiliter pubescens, niger, capite thoracisque lateribus 

 obscure ferrugineis, hoc lateribus marginato, cum elytri3 angulum haud formante, 

 his nigris margine angusto basali, fasciis undatis duabus interrupts (pnsteriore 

 indistincta) margine laterali apiceque testaceis, pedibus runs. Long. -15. 



One specimen from Illinois ; Mr. Willcox. Of the same form as H. mixtus, 

 from which it is distinguished by its black under surface. The bands of the 

 elytra are placed a3 in H. undulatus and its allies, but are much inrerrupted, 

 and of the posterior one only the lateral spot and a very small discoidal dot are 

 visible ; the basal margin is testaceous towards the scutellura. The dark red of 

 the thorax fades imperceptibly into black, in such manner as to induce me tr> 

 believe, that specimens will be found having a red thorax, with only the basal 

 margin blackish. The males are probably more distinctly punctured. 



41. H. n i g e r. What I consider as Say's species resembles extremely in form, 

 sculpture and color, H. punctatissimus, but is a little more obtuse anteriorly, 

 and equally attenuated behind ; it may be distinguished by the lateral margin of 

 the thorax being hardly conspicuous, while in H. punctatissimus it is 

 broad and thickened. The head is more finely punctulate, and the epistoma is 

 not margined. 



47. H. subtonsus, longior ovalis, parum convexus, parce pubescens, niger, 

 ore rufescente, thorace lateribus vix marginatis rufescentibua cum elytris an- 

 gulum obtusum formantibus, angulis posticis rectis, disco parce subtilius, ad basin 

 ct latera distinctius puuctato, elytris stepe testaceo-piceis, modice punctatis, 

 pedibus rufo-testaceis. Long. -125. 



Lake Superior and Vermont. Resembles in appearance H. varians and H. 

 puberulus, and likely to be confounded with them. H. varians is narrower and 

 more oblong, the sides being almost parallel at the middle, and is entirely gla- 

 brous. H. puberulus has the posterior angles of the thorax obtuse and very 

 distinctly impressed. The elytra of the female are less shining and le^s deeply 

 punctured than those of the female. 



53. II. c o 1 1 ar is, piceo-testaceus, longior ellipticus parum convexus, glaber, 

 thorace lateribus rotundatis fortiter marginatis cum elytris angulum obtusis- 

 simum formantibus, parce punctulato, grossius ad ba^in, elytria minus dense 

 punctatis, punctis postice subtilioribus. Long. -14. 



Two specimens; Lake Superior. The usual discoidal row of punctures on the 

 elytra is more distinct than usual towards the base of the elytra; the apical row 

 of punctures on the thorax is likewise well marked. 



55. H.concinnus, longior ovalis postice attenuatus, parum convexus,

298 [April, 



Fort Laramie, Nebraska. The first fascia proceeds from the middle of the 

 humeral spot, runs obliquely inwards, and is dilated into a quadrilateral spot 

 with elongated angles ; the second fascia is just behind the middle, and is deeply 

 emarginate anteriorly; neither attain the suture. The anterior black band of the 

 thorax covers nearly half the surface. In one specimen nearly the whole abdo- 

 men is ferruginous.

One specimen from Alabama, collected by Mr. Hentz, was given me by Prof. 

 Haldeman. The color and markings are almost as in the preceding ; the body, 

 however, is broader and more obtuse in front and more acute behind ; the sutu- 

 ral stria is not visible, and the color beneath is ferruginous, though darker than 

 the red of the feet, head and thorax.

Mas antennarum articulis 4to late, 3io et 5to anguste dilatatis. 



One immature specimen from Georgia. Resembles H. conoideus, but is larger, 

 and the thorax would never become black. The punctures of the elytra are equal 

 in size, while in H. conoideus two sizes are intermixed; the dilated third joint 

 of the antennas is also narrower than the fourth, while in the other species men- 

 tioned they are of equal breadth. 



59. H. sira ilis Kirby. This may be identical with the European H. picipes, 

 but I have not been able to compare them. I must consider, however, that there 

 are reasons why the following species should not be considered as H. lineellus of 

 Europe, which is admitted to be a female variety of H. picipes. 



60. H. pi cat u s Kirby. Of this species I found both sexes at Mackinaw, 

 and on the north shore of Lake Superior. The dull and finely punctured female 

 hardly differs from the preceding, but the coarsely punctured male has no dis- 

 tinct elytral striae. Otherwise there is no special difference. 



62. H. turbidus, ovalis convexus, piceus, nitidus, capite pedibus thorace-

One specimen from Massachusetts was given me by Mr. Zimmerman. Resem- 

 bles in characters H. suturalis, but is broader and more convex, and the elytra 

 are less densely punctured The color is more reddish, there is no diseoidal 

 spot on the thorax, and the suture of the elytra is not paler.

Fort Laramie, Nebraska Similar in form to the Californian H. lutescens, but 

 less convex, lighter colored, and with the sides of the thorax a little longer and 

 almost entirely straight, and the elytra more coarsely punctured.

truelis, and more finely and densely punctured. The head and thorax are never 

 clouded ; the vittae of the elytra are sometimes reduced to merely a confused 

 cloud behind the middle; at other times they are visible nearly to the base; in 

 the latter case the first and third are a little shorter anteriorly, and the third 

 and fourth are interrupted befofe the middle. In some there is a slight remnant 

 of an interrupted submarginal stripe. The thorax is formed as in H. patruelL-. 

 and is sometimes marked with a central fuscous dot. 



70. H. discoideus, latior ovalis fere depressu3 (minus nitidu?) subtus 

 niger, antennis pedibus eorporeque supra testaceus, capite lateribus et occipite

 confertissime punctulatis disco maximo communi infuscatis, sutura lineolisque 

 anticis paucis pallidioribus, margine late testaceo relicto. Long. *15. 



One female found at Fort Laramie. Broader and flatter than the allied 

 species, and (in case the male should be more shining and more coarsely punc- 

 tured) distinguished by the large basal spot of the thorax. The head and thorax 

 are moderately punctured; the dark portion of the elytra is very well defined, 

 and does not fade at all into the broad pale margin. 



73. H. m e 1 1 i t u s , subovatus convexus postice attenuate, flavo-testaceus 

 subtiliter pubescens, capite punctulato epistomate late emarginato, thorace sub-

One specimen from Vermont, collected by the late Prof. U. B. Adams. By the 

 form of the epistoma it resembles H. hybridus, but is much smaller and more 

 ovate in form, while the spots of the elytra do not form transverse fascia?, though 

 those that remain are referable to that style of marking.

Lake Superior, two specimens: very similar in all its characters to the next, 

 and only distinguished by the narrower elytra, and wider and less convex 

 thorax: the latter is somewhat less densely punctured, but the basal fovea is 

 obsoletely prolonged each side. As in the four next species the stria? of the 

 elytra are hardly impressed, their punctures are very distinct anteriorly, but grow 

 small towards the tip, till they are hardly larger than the intervening rows of 

 small points. The head just behiud the eye is armtd each side with an obtuse 

 not very distinct tubercle.

One specimen found at San Jose, California, Related to the two preceding 

 species, bnt the punctures of the elytra are larger and somewhat connected by 

 transverse r, gae. The lateral teeth of the thorax are more conspicuous, and the 

 basal fovea is faint: the head is about equal in width to the thorax, and has 

 behind each eye a scarcely distinct obtuse tooth.

Lake Superior: the sides of the thorax are smooth anteriorly, but have a few 

 email teeth near the posterior angles, which though obtuse are quite distinct. 

 It is distinguished from the next principally by the thorax being very little 

 broader than its length: the thorax varies in color becoming sometimes almost 

 rufous.

Corlicaria dentieulnta\\ Kirhy, Fauna Bor. Am. 110. 



Lake Superior, very abundaut: the serrations of the thorax are less conspicu- 

 ous towards the anterior angles. I do not feel certain that the former species 

 should be separated from this: I can find no difference except the relative pro- 

 portions of the thorax, and as both are found in one locality and mingled to- 

 gether, it is quite possible that they are really different sexes of one species; in 

 which case the name appended to the present description must for obvious 

 reasons be retained.

One specimen, Lake Superior; fiom the next two species this is distinguished 

 by the form and coarser punctuation of the thorax. As in C. compta, and in the 

 next two, the beautifully regular arrangement of the hairs on the elytra causes 

 the interstices between the strice of quadrate punctures to appear in some lights 

 very finely carinated.

Middle and Southern States : rare. Varies in having the elytra piceous, with 

 two large testaceous rounded spots on each, one behind the base and the other 

 behind the middle. The 9th joint of the antennae is hardly larger than the 8th, 

 which, together with the absence of pubescence, gives to the insect a peculiar 

 appearance, and suggests even the establishment of a separate genus for its re- 

 ception. 



In the next species, however, the external appearance of the ordinary species 

 of Corticaria is resumed, though the antennas are as in the present one.

One specimen found at the Colorado River in California. The hairs of the 

 elytra are precisely as in the many species of the division A, but the punctures 

 of the normal striae are very small, hardly larger, in fact, than those of the in-

 large external anterior fovea to the posterior constriction, and though fine is 

 quite distinct; the two dorsal carinas are parallel anteriorly, and between them 

 is eeen an oval fovea : towards the base they converge, and are continued 

 through the transverse impression.

306 [April, 



Notes derived from observations made on the Birds of New Mexico during the 



years 1853 and 1854. 



By T. Charlton Henry, M.D., U. S. Army. 



The following observations were made by the writer, on the Ornithology of 

 that portion of New Mexico lying south and north-west of the Jornada del Muerto, 

 a portion of country differing very essentially from that situated in the vicinity 

 of Santa Fe. In special, or nearly special, reference to the Ornithology of the 

 latter, it will be recollected that Col. McCall, late Inspector General, U. S. 

 Army, published, somewhat more than two years ago, in the Proceedings of the 

 Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, an interesting and able article. It 

 will be observed that the writer in the present case, having devoted his entire 

 leisure to his favorite pursuit for a period of more than two years, while stationed 

 at Forts Fillmore, Webster and Thorn, each in turn, has succeeded in adding 

 largely to the list published by Col. McCall, as above referred to. 



A word relative to the topography of the several locations where the observa- 

 tions were made. 



Fort Fillmore is situated on the eastern bank of the Rio Grande, south of 

 Santa Fe two hundred and seventy-five miles, its level above the sea being several 

 thousand feet less than the latter place. Small mesquit and cotton-wood, with 

 more or less " tornilla," is the principal wood to be met with in its locality. 

 The soil is sandy, except in the bottom land, where alluvial deposit exists to a cer- 

 tain extent, of argillaceous character, and black loam. Fifteen miles north-east of 

 the Fort are the Organ Mountains, but no investigations was the writer able to 

 make there during the four months he was stationed at Fort Fillmore ; the size 

 of the garrison, to which he was Post Surgeon, precluding the practicability of 

 his absenting himself therefrom for any length of time. August, September, 

 October, November and part of December, were passed at Fort F. The writer 

 was then ordered to Fort Webster, near the Sierra de los Mimbres and near the 

 copper mines, the post being built on the banks of ihe Rio de los Mimbres (River 

 of Willows) a small, rocky and beautifully clear stream. 



This location was in the very heart of the mountain ; the ground very elevated, 

 and the soil along the stream exceedingly rich, being much of it black muck, with 

 scarce a particle of clay in its composition. On the upland, where grew in pro- 

 fusion the nutritious " gamma grass," a limestone base was covered lightly with 

 vegetable deposit. The face of the country was plains, narrow valleys and high 

 mountains, alternately. 



The timber consisted of white cedar, (Juniperus albus,) pinon, (Pinus mono- 

 phyllus,) white pine, (P. altissimus,) scrub oak, (Q. olivaeformis,) and black wal- 

 nut, among the mountains ; along the brook, cotton wood, white water ash and 

 box alder, the latter rather sparse. The geological character of the mountains 

 is principally limestone, associated with traces of iron and lead, and silver not 

 unfrequently found in combination. Spar, unlike the composition of the Organ 

 Mountain range near Fort Fillmore, very little or none. Copper also, in the 

 form of carbonate, abounds in the vicinity ; also, as usual, associated with a cre- 

 taceous base; black volcanic rock, to a small extent, is to be met with. 



At Fort Webster the writer passed more than a year, when he was removed 

 to Fort Thorn, situated on the Rio Grande, some fifty miles above Fort Fillmore. 

 Soil, timber, &c, are all similar to that found about Fort Fillmore, with a slight 

 difference only in temperature. 



With these few preliminaries, which the writer deems of some service, as 

 bearing in a measure upon the character of the haunts frequented by certain 

 birds, many species of which, in this region, although found in great abundance 

 in one locality, yet in another, a few miles only distant, are never met with, 

 he will proceed to note every bird actually met with, during nearly three years 

 sojourn in New Mexico, of which he has, in most every instance, procured 

 specimens. 




1855.] 307 



CATHARTES. 



I. C. aura. Common during the summer months, especially along the Rio 

 Grande; among the mountains fewer. In winter rarely seen. Most abundant 

 in the spring and fall. 



BUTEO. 



2- B. borealis. Breeds rather abundantly; common everywhere. Numerous 

 specimens obtained. 



3. B. Pennsylvanictjs. Rarely met with. One near Fort Fillmore shot in Sep- 

 tember. 



4. B. lagopts. Not rare. Several specimens obtained. Feed much upon mal- 

 lards and other ducks. Observed only once on the Rio Mimbres ; not unfrequently 

 shot while duck hunting along the Del Norte. 



HALI^TUS. 



5. H. leucocephalus. But t wo or three pair seen at Forts Fillmore and Thorn, 

 during the winter only. One young male in brown plumage obtained at Fort 

 Webster ; the only one seen there. 



PANDION. 



6. P. hali,etus. Two or three seen at each station ; one shot. Apparently not 

 numerous. The maddiness of the Rio Grande, and the small size of the few 

 clear streams found in the country, will probably account for it ; in the first case 

 their prey bein^ not readily seen from above ; in the second, the few fish found 

 being very small. 



FALCO. 



7. F. columbarius. Occasionally seen only ; numerous nowhere. One obtained 

 at Fort Webster. 



8. F. sparverius. Common everywhere. Resident. 



ASTUR. 



9. A. Cooperi. One shot near Fort Webster; no other observed. 



10. A. fuscus. Common among the mountains; very rarely seen elsewhere. 

 Several obtained. 



CIRCUS. 



II. C. cyaneus. Extremely common everywhere. Prey much upon the par- 

 tridges (L. Gambelli) and also ducks. 



SURNIA. 



12. S. hypogcea. A few observed upon portions of the Jornada del Muerto. 



OTUS. 



13. O. vulgaris. Quite common in the fall along the Del Norte. Observed 

 among the mountains but twice. 



BUBO. 



14. B. Virginianus. Common in both localities. One shot very nearly white. 



CHORDEILES. 



15 C. Virginianus. Very common everywhere from April to July ; makes its 

 first appearance in the latter part of March. 



CAPRIMULGUS. 



16. C. Nuttallii. Found both along the Rio Grande and Mimbres; much more 

 common at the latter place. Arrives and migrates in the latter part of October. 




308 



[April, 



HIRUNDO. 



17. H. purpurea. Not very common. Observed only at Fort Webster. Ar- 

 rives about the middle of April and remains about two months only. 



18. H. bicolor. Very common throughout New Mexico. Arrives about the 

 10th of April, and migrates about-the last of August. 



19. H. thalassina. Common, more particularly along the Mimbres. Arrives 

 early in April, and leaves by the 5th of August. 



20. H. rufa. Quite common along the Rio Grande. Time of arrival a few 

 days later than H. fulva; migrates about August 15th. A few only seen on the 

 Mimbres. 



21. H fulva. Observed only at the Mimbres. Not numerous. Arrives the 

 last of March and migrates the last of July. 



22. H. riparia. Common botb in the Valley of the Del Norte and among the 

 mountains. Arrives soon after H. thalassina, and migrates somewhat later. 



MUSCICAPA. 



23. M. verticalis. Found in abundance among the mountains. Arrives at 

 Fort Webster March 25th, and leaves about the 20th of August. Never seen 

 along the Valley of the Rio Grande. 



24. M Saya. Seems to take the place of the Verticalis along the Rio Grande. 

 Common at Forts Fillmore and Thorn. Arrives the 1st of February, and is not 

 seen after the 25th of July, unless very rarely ; one seen in January. 



25. M. nigricans. Rather common among the mountains. Occasionally seen 

 along the Del Norte. Always affects the neighborhood of streams. Arrives 

 31st of March ; not observed after the 20th of July. 



26. M. pusilla. Not rare along the mountain streams ; often observed at Fort 

 Webster. Arrives late in May, and migrates the last of July. 



PYROCEPHALUS. 



27. P. rubineus. One shot in May at Fort Webster ; the only specimen met 

 with ; a male in full plumage. 



PTILOGONYS. 



28. P. Townsendii. Very abundant during the winter months only, about 

 Fort Webster, where they always frequent the neighborhood of cedar trees and 

 feed on their berries. Arrive in October in considerable flocks, and soon sepa- 

 rate into pairs or threes ; migrate the last of March. They appear to possess no 

 power of song, although in March they frequently utter a peculiar note, very 

 short and interrupted. Their call note may well be compared to the slight creak- 

 ing of an ungreased carriage wheel. Their call note differs from their attempts 

 at singing in spring. Seem very retiring, and are usually met with in shady 

 glens near a stream where cedars abound. 



They do not nest in the neighborhood of the Mimbres, nor do they migrate in 

 the spring in flocks, as far as 1 can ascertain. Never met with along the valley 

 of the Rio Grande. 



29. P. nitens. Three or four pair observed about Fort Webster, and shot in 

 June, 1853. First observed May 25th; none seen after July. Not seen on the 

 Rio Grande. Nest on the Mimbres. 



TOXOSTOMA. 



30. T. rediviva. Found rather abundantly about Fort Fillmore. Frequents 

 the mesquit exclusively. More observed during the months of October and 

 November than during the summer. A few seen during the month of August. 

 Am unable to say whether it breeds here. Rarely seen after December. Two 

 or three seen at Fort Thorn during December 1853. Never observed on the 

 Rio de los Mimbres. 




1855.] 309 



CULICIVORA. 



31. C. ccerulea. Rare throughout the country. A few seen at the Mimbres 

 during the month of April ; first observed on the 12th of that month. Probably 

 does not breed here. 



SYLVICOLA. 



32. S. coronata. Very abundant everywhere '"ring the months of April and 

 October. First observed at the Mimbres, April 2d. 



33. S. striata. One or two only observed in April at the Mimbres. 



34. S. ccerulea. One observed at the Mimbres during the latter part of April. 



35. S. jestiva. Common throughout the country in summer. Arrives in the 

 early part of April, and migrates southward the latter part of July. 



36. S. nigricans. One shot May lOthon the Mimbres, the only one observed 

 at any tump. 



37. S. Canadensis. A few observed on the Mi nbres, and one along the Rio 

 Grande near Fort Thorn, in May. 



TRICHAS. 



38. T. Tolmiei. Breeds about the mountains along the Rio Mimbres. Never 

 seen in the valley of tire Rio Grande. Three specimens obtained. 



39. T. Marilandica. Very common along the Mimbres, where it breeds; in 

 less numbers along the valley of the Rio Grande. Arrives about the 1st of April 

 and disappears the latter part of July. 



HELINAIA. 



40. H. chrysopteua. One only seen near Fort Thorn in April, 1854. 



CERTHIA. 



41. C. FAiiiLiARTs. Vury common among the mountains in summer, where it 

 probably breeds. Never seen, except in winter, along the valley of the Rio 

 Grande. 



TROGLODYTES. 



42. T. obsoletus. Very common among the mountains in summer, where it 

 breeds. Not seen on the Rio Grande. Arrives at Fort Webster by the 15th of 

 March, and disappears the last of July. 



43. T. Americanus. Occasionally seen only in winter and late in fall. Two 

 or three obtained at the Mimbres and Fort Fillmore. 



44. T. palustris. Very common in summer everywhere, but most abundant 

 along the small mountain streams where there are marshy shores. Breeds in 

 the territory. Many winter along the Rio Grande. 



PARUS. 



45. P. minimus. Common among the mountains. Resident. Not met with 

 along the river. 



46. P. bicolor. Common in winter among the mountains. Not on the Rio 

 Grande. 



47. P. Wollweberi. One only seen ; shot on the 10th of May, at Fort Webster. 



REGULUS. 



48. R. satrapa. Common along the Sierra de los Mimbres. Resident. Some- 

 times seen in winter along the Rio Grande. 



49. R. calendula. One or two met with among the mountains. 




310 [April, 



SIALIA. 



^ 50. S. occidentals. From October 20th to March 10th abundant, both among 

 the mountains, where they feed on the cedar berries, and along the river, where 

 they make the berries of the miseltoe their food. 



51. S. arctica. Much rarer along the Rio Grande than among the mountains, 

 where they breed. Arrive about the ]0th of February, and remain in the river 

 valley but a fortnight or three weeks; among the mountains some two months, 

 or until one brood is reared, after which they take their departure. Once seen 

 as early as January 29th. 



CINCLUS. 



52. C. Americanus. Very abundant on the Rio Mimbres during the whole 

 winter, from the 10th of October until the 1st of April. Never seen along the 

 Rio Grande, nor any where in the summer. 



ORPHEUS. 



53. O. polyglottus. Quite common, both along the Rio Grande valley and 

 among the mountains, in the summer ; in both situations breeds. 



54. O. montanus. One shot at Fort Webster, January 27th. 



TURDUS. 



55. T. migratoritjs. Abundant on the Mimbres during the fall and winter. 

 Very few seen after May, till October. Very f w ever seen on the Rio Grande, 

 and when seen, only in winter. Their range confined to those parts of the country 

 only where cedars abound. 



56. T. solitarius. A few resident throughout the country. 



57. T. nanus. Very common in April on the Rio Grande, both at Forts Thorn 

 and Fillmore. Probably migrates farther northward. 



ANTHUS. 



58. A. ludovicianus. A few straggling flocks observed every spring and 

 fall, both in high and low ground. 



ALAUDA. 



59. A. occidentals. Found during the spring and winter, chiefly on open 

 plains and elevated ground. Not resident. 



PLECTROPHANES. 



60. P. McCownii, (Lawrence). Very large flocks everywhere, especially 

 about the margins of the Rio Grande from the 10th of October to the last of 

 April. Their habits much resemble those of P. nivalis. Never saw any in full 

 summer plumage, as they do not breed here. 



[Description by George N. Lawrence, Esq. Head before the New York Lyceum of 

 Natural History, 8th Sept., 1851, and published in Proceedings of that Society.

1855.] 311 



EMBERIZA. 



61. E. grammaca. Arrive at the Mimbres on the 25th of April, where they 

 remain about two months. Found only among the mountains. 



62. E. graminea. Only one met with on the Mimbres, on the 8th of January, 

 during a thaw. 



63. E. passerina. A few seen on the Rio Grande during the latter part of 

 February. Two obtained. 



64. E. socialis. Arrives in small numbers March 4th, and remains in the 

 country till the last of July. Not abundant. 



NIPHEA. 



65. N. Oregona. Among the mountains. A few seen during the summer, 

 where during the winter they are extremely common. It is fownd also in con- 

 siderable number along the river valley during the winter months. 



LINARIA. 



66. L. fines. Common everywhere, except in Summer, through the 

 country. 



CARPODACUS. 



67. C. familiaris. Rather common during the months of April and May, 

 both in high and low grounds, feeding on the buds of the cotton wood, (P. Can- 

 adensis.) Breeds, (as observed by Col. McCall,) about Santa Fe and the vi- 

 cinity. 



C. obscures, (McCall.) Three shot near Fort Webster ; found in winter, 

 among the pines upon a mountain. Male and female of similar plumage. 



CARDUELIS. 



68. C. Magellamcus. Principally observed along the Rio Grande in the 

 month of September. Its sojourn is very short. A very few seen in May at 

 Fort Webster. Probably breeds among the mountains. 



FRINGILLA. 



69. F. melodia. Common during the winter and early spring, but not very 

 numerous. 



70. F. i.eucophrys. The most abundant species of sparrow in New Mexico 

 during the whole year, but most numerous in winter. Never have met with 

 nest or eggs. 



PIPILO. 



71. P. arctica. Throughout the summer remains among the mountains. 

 Common along the Rio Grande in the winter months. 



72. P. fusca. Like its congener, a constant resident in the territory, but 

 unlike in never frequenting the river valley. Affects the locality of cedar 

 bushes and mountain canons ; hence termed the Canon Finch. (See Cassin's Il- 

 lustrations.) Found at Fort Webster ; equally common with P. Arctica ; very 

 shy and retiring in his habits; never found in flocks. 



CORYDALINA. 



73. C. bicolor. During the Spring of 1853 I observed a few specimens of 

 this species. They appeared as if migrating, and I never since met with others, 

 either in high or low land. Those seen were near Fort Webster. 



COCCOBORUS. 



74. C co3ruleus. Quite common in Summer along the river valley. A 

 few seen on the Rio Mimbres. They no doubt breed in the territory. 



75. C. melanoleucus. A few seen and obtained along the Sierra de los 

 Mimbres in the latter part of May, 1S53, when they were in full song. Never 

 seen in winter ; rare. 




312 [April, 



COCCOTHRAUSTES. 



70. C. VESPERiiNA. A few seen among the mountains in March, 1853, and 

 two specimens obtained. 



PYRANGA. 



77. P. aestiva. Rather common in summer along the Rio Grande. One 

 or two met with in the mountains, where they are rather rare. 



MOLOTHRUS. 



78. M. pecoris. Rather common everywhere from April to November. 

 Not seen in winter. 



AGELAIUS. 



79. A. phcenicetts. Common throughout the year. Breeds in the terri- 

 tory. 



80. A.xanthocephalus. Verycommon during the greater part of the year. 

 Not seen in winter. 



QUISCALUS. 



81. Q. Breweri. Very common during the early spring and fall months. 



STURNELLA. 



82. S. neglecta. Common throughout the year. Most numerous in the 

 valley of the Del Norte. 



CORVUS. 



83. C. corax. Exceedingly abundant, especially in winter. Breeds among 

 the mountains, chiefly, but not exclusively. 



84. C. Americanus. Very rare, according to my observation ; but two met 

 with, and at Fort Webster. 



GARRULUS. 



85. G. stelleri. A common jay among the mountains. 



86. G. ui.tramarinus. The most abundant species ; found in fall, not unfre- 

 quenily along the Valley of the Rio Grande, but exceedingly numerous among 

 the mountains. 



87. G. CRrsTATrjs. Found about the woods bordering the northernmost por- 

 tion of the Rio Grande. This I state not upon my own, but upon the authority 

 of a person perfectly familiar with the blue jay of North America. 



GYMNOK1TTA, (Prince de Wied.) 



88. G. cyan rppiiALA. This extremely graceful and beautiful shaped jay 

 I have met with along: the Sierra del los Mimbres range, some five or six times. 

 It is invariably found in flocks of forty or more individuals; very shy and diffi- 

 cult of approach. This is the Cyanocorax Cassini of Col. McCall. I never 

 met this bird along the valley of the del Norte. The peculiar taper bill of this 

 species is quite characteristic ; very unlike that of the general family Corvinae 

 of Wilson. Its wings are also far wider in proportion than it is common to see in 

 the jay family ; and the tout ensemble of the bird, except its bill, would seem 

 to my mind to ally it nearly to the Nucifragre. 



NUCIFRAGA. 



89. N. CoLTJMBrANA. Quite common near Fort Webster, during the months 

 of November and December. Found mostly among the pinons, (Pinus mono- 

 phyllus.) 



LANIUS. 



90. L. LiiDovicrANis. Common and resident in the territory, but most abun- 

 dant in the winter months. 




1855.] 313 



VIREO. 



91. V. gilvus. Common ; the only one of this family ever obtained by me 

 in New Mexico. From March 25th to August 15th. 



ICTERIA. 



92. I. viridis. A few seen during the spring and summer of 1853 on the 

 Rio Mimbres, where they appeared to breed. Perhaps this species may be the 

 longlcauda of Lawrence. 



BOMBICILLA. 



93. B. Carolinensis. One flock observed frequenting the wild currant 

 bushes near Fort Webster, in June, 1853. I obtained two specimens in order to 

 prove their identity. Never seen elsewhere in the territory. 



SITTA. 



94. S. Carolinensis. A few only met with ; mostly about Fort Fillmore. 



95. S. Canadensis. Not rare among the mountains; much more common 

 than the former. 



96. S. pygmea. Several seen, and two shot near Fort Fillmore in 1853 ; 

 none since seen. 



TROCH1LUS. 



97. T. anna. Very abundant among the mountains in August and Septem- 

 ber ; their haunts being flowery canons, in the neighborhood of rocky streams. 

 Rarely met with in the valley of Del Norte. 



ALCEUO. 



98. A. alcyon. Not very common ; seen principally along the Rio de los 

 Mimbres ; the Rio Grande, in lat. below 30 being too murky a stream to suit 

 his tasre. 



PICUS. 



99. P. THYROiDETjs. Found only occasionally in fall and winter, among the 

 mountains. Three specimens obtained. Seem quite gentle, and are readily ap- 

 proachable. Never seen, except in the vicinity of or among pine trees. 



100. P. varius This bird, rarely found elsewhere than in the mountains, is 

 rather common in the localities which it affects. 



101. P. formicivorus. Quite rare; met with among the highest pine-clad 

 mountains only. But the specimens were very shy and difficult of approach, 

 even when perched on the highest trees. 



102. P. villosus. Quite common everywhere. 



103. P. torqtjatus. Not very rare in the mountains. Generally found 

 among pine trees. Their shyness is very marked. 



104. P. scalaris. Not rare along the Rio Grande. Affects principally the 

 mesquit, (P. glandulosa,) as a resort. Not common in the mountains. Seems 

 to take the place of P. pubescens. 



105. P. Mexicanus, or collaris. A very common species throughout the ter- 

 ritory ; the most so of any othr. 



COCCYZUS. 



106. S. Americanus. A few seen in summer, along the Rio Grande del 

 Norte.

COLUMBA. 



107. C. fasciata. Common in the mountains during the months of Septem- 

 ber and October, when they feed upon acorns ; very shy ; a few breed near the 

 old copper mines near Fort Webster. The writer has met this species on the 

 Mimbres in June, feeding on the berries of the wild currant. 



ECTOPISTES. 



10S. E. Carolinensis. Extremely abundant everywhere, especially during 

 the summer months. Large numbers resident. 



MELEAGRIS. 



109. M. gallipavo. Common through all the more unsettled parts of the 

 territory, both in high and low land. The species found here has the upper 

 tail coverts broadly tipped with white. 



CYRTONYX. 



110. C. massena. Not rare in the mountains; occasionally seen along the 

 Rio Grande- Lie well to the dog, and afford much sport in shooting them. 

 Their favorite resorts are along mountain sides, where they procure various 

 kinds of insects, by grubbing them out with their bills, at the roots of the grass. 

 Never detected vegetable matter in the stomachs of any. This species often 

 hides behind stones and in hollows after being flushed. 



LOPHORTYX. 



111. L. Gambei.il The common quail of this country; found both in the 

 high and low land. They are said not to lie well to a dog, but I have proved 

 that this is the case only in bright weather ; for often in cloudy days 1 have seen 

 them lie well to a well-broken pointer. Their food, unlike the Massena par- 

 tridge, is exclusively, almost, vegetable. The berries of the miseltoe in win- 

 ter seem to furnish their principal food. 



CALLIPEPLA. 



112. C squamata. Found only in high ground, elevated plains or mountain 

 sides. They appear to be far the shyest of their species. Their flesh I prefer 

 to that of either of the other. Capt. J. P. McCown, U. S. A., in his notes upon 

 this bird, as observed in Texas, published by Geo. N. Lawrence, Esq., says he 

 "thinks they never affect open plains." But as far as my observation goe3, 

 (which is quite extended in regard to this species) although generally found in 

 ihe neighborhood of bushes, particularly mesquit and wild sage, I have of- 

 ten seen them feeding on perfectly open rocky hills. 



GEOCOCCYX. 



113. G. viaticcs. Quite common among the mesquit bushes everywhere along 

 the Del Norte. Rarer in the mountainous parts of the country. 



TETRAO. 



114. T. obscurus. One flock, only seen near the summit of the Sierra de 

 los Mimbres. 1 state this fact on good authority, as I did not see the birds 

 myself. All, however, agree they are not rare in the northern portions of the 

 territory.

12G. T. flavipes. Quite abundant in the months of August and September 

 in marshes bordering the Rio Grande. 



127. T. vociferus. Found along the Rio Grande in small numbers during the 

 spring and autumn months. Not seen in flocks as the former, but in parties of 

 two or three, and more frequently singly. 



SCOLOPAX.

 abundant anywhere, but more or less met with along the Del Norte in fall and 

 spring.

142. A. Canadensis. Resident. Breeds on the Rio Grande. Found in tolerable 

 abundance throughout the winter. Not so common in summer. A few breed 

 along the river. 



143. A. albifrons. I have never seen but three of this species, of which I 

 shot two at Fort Thorn in the fall of 1854. Said to be quite common a hundred 

 and fifty miles higher up the Rio Grande del Norte. 



144. A. hvperboreus. About as common as the albifrons. Few seen below 

 Albuquerque.

145. A. boschas. Extremely common everywhere in winter. Many resident 

 throughout the year. Breed in greater or less number. 



146. A. obscura. Rare. A few seen on the Rio Grande every spring, on 

 their passage north. 



147. A. strepera. This beautiful duck is even more common than the Mal- 

 lard in ponds adjoining the Rio del Norte, but only during the spring and winter 

 months. Never observed after April till the last of October. Rare on the Rio 

 Mimbres. 



148. A. Americana. Not rare, both along the Del Norte and Mimbres in fall 

 and winter. 



149. A. acuta. Much rarer than the last. A few seen every spring and fall

150. A. sponsa. But two or three ever met with, and only on the Rio Mimbres. 



151. A. Carolinensis. Quite common during the spring and fall along the 

 Del Norte. Many winter on the Munbres. Not met with in the summer. 



152. A. discors. Not as common as the last. 



153. A. Rafflesii. This beautilul duck is the most common summer duck 

 found between latitudes 31 and 33. Rarely seen in winter. Probably breeds 

 in the section where it abounds in summer. Very common on the Mimbres and 

 Del N Tte. it is usua ly lound among the sedge that borders sloughs near a water- 

 course, where its plumage, so closely resembling the reddish brown of the withered 

 sedge of last year's growth, renders it observed vvith difficulty, thus carrying out 

 that admirable rule in nature's handiwork that so generally prevails, viz., as- 

 similation of the plumage of birds to the color of the haunts they affect. 



154. A. clypeata. Rather rare. Occasionally seen in fall and spring on the 

 Del Norte and Mimbres.

Analyses of the Meteoric Iron from Tuczon, Province of Sonora, Mexico. 



By In. F. A. Gexth. 



The masses of Meteoric Iron of Taczon, first brought to notice by Dr. J L 

 Le Come, (SHI. Journ. II. Ser. XIII. 289,) and afterwards more fully described 

 bv Prof. C. U. Shepard, (Sill. Journ. II. Ser. XVIII, 369,) were also mentioned by 



25 




318 



[April, 



Dr. J. L. Smith in his Memoir on Meteorites, published in the last number of the 

 same Journal, March 1855, in which he gives the analysis of a piece cut from 

 one of the huge masses by Lieut. Jno. G. Parke, of the IT. S. Topographical 

 Engineers. Several months ago I had finished the following analyses of the 

 same meteorite, (which will be found to agree very well with those of Dr. Smith,) 

 but various circumstances have heretofore prevented my presenting to the 

 Academy the results of my examinations, which were made with pieces taken 

 from the specimen presented to the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences, 

 by Dr. Heermann. 



To the descriptions of this meteorite given by D. C. U. Shepard and Dr. J. L. 

 Smith, I have to add only a few words. 



The pieces which I have examined were not passive, as Prof. Shepard remarks, 

 but dissolved readily in nitric acid, and also immediately precipitated metallic 

 copper from the solution of the sulphate. On dissolving it in chlorohydric acid, 

 only a slight odor of carburetted hydrogen was perceptible, and no gas evolved, 

 which precipitated an ammoniacal solution of chloride of copper ; a very small 

 quantity of Schreibersite separated in form of a brownish powder. 



On evaporation of the solution by nitric acid in a waterbath and subsequent 

 moistening of the dry mass by chlorohydric acid, all the substances were taken 

 up, excepting a small residue of siliceous matter. This dissolved partly on boil- 

 ing with carbonate of soda, leaving a residue, which I took for a feldspathic 

 mineral ; the quantity obtained, however, was too small for further examination ; 

 the small quantities of alkalies, lime and alumina speak in favor of this view, 

 and indicate that the residue insoluble in carbonate of soda is labradorite, a 

 mineral which is partly decomposed by acids. The silica, soluble in carbonate 

 of soda, results undoubtedly from the decomposition of olivine. I was particu- 

 larly cartful to obtain the whole quantity of cobalt and nickel, and have, there- 

 fore, not separated the sesquioxide of iron br carbonate of baryta, which method 

 is not quite correct; but have precipitated the boiling solution, containing sesqui- 

 oxide of iron, oxide of cobalt and nickel, magnesia, etc., and a sufficient quan- 

 tity of chloride of am -nonium by ammonia, and immediately afterwards acidulated 

 by acetic acid, boiled and filtered. All the other determinations were made as 

 usually. 



The following results were obtained. 



Notice upon the viviparous Fishes inhabiting the Pacific coast of North America, with 



an enumeration of the species observed. 



By Charles Girard. 



The observations which we have traced upon the genital apparatus of the 

 female, have satisfied us that there exists an ovarian sheath or sack, which, 

 during the early period of pregnancy, is an elongated and subcylindrical tube, 

 containing the ovaries proper, two in number, each of which consisting of two, 

 three, or more vascular membranes, attached by their upper edge to the upper 




1855.] 319 



floor or roof of the sheath, forming either one, two, or more pouches (according 

 to the number of these membranes) of the same length as the sheath itself, widely 

 open beneath, though not in a direct communication with one another, since the 

 membranes hang loosely down, resting on the lower floor of the sheath. 



The eggs are formed within the texture of the ovarian membranes themselves. 

 We have examined the ovaries of Ennichthys heermanni, when the sheath, within 

 which they were contained, was not larger than an ordinary quill. Numerous 

 eggs could be observed in a very immature state, appearing to the naked eye 

 like minute dots. Under the microscope, they exhibited evident traces of the 

 germinal vesicle, surrounded as yet with a very scanty supply of vittiline sub- 

 stance. 



The sheath and the ovaries are gradually increasing in bulk, as the eggs them- 

 selves first increase in size and the embryos afterwards. The sheath is a mus- 

 cular membrane chiefly, whilst the ovarian membranes, we have stated, are 

 altogether vascular. 



When miture, the eggs either fall into the space between the membranes or 

 ovarian pouches, or else remain attached to the ovaries until the embryos issue 

 out of them. We are inclined to think that they drop into the pouches as eggs. 

 At any rate, we found very young embryos loosely contained in the ovarian 

 pouches, when no trace of the egg membrane could be seen within the tissues of 

 the ovaries in the shape of corpora lutei or graffian vesicles. Whatever be the 

 case, numerous eggs or embryos may be observed within one pouch. The young 

 thus remain together until grown to a considerable size, when, filling up the 

 space in a more compact manner, the ovarian membranes, in their nature very 

 expansive, will extend a fold between each embryo. In this manner every indi- 

 vidual young, when removed sideways from the ovary, appears to the operator 

 as if enclosed in a separate cavity, pouch, or follicle, of the ovary, whilst, in 

 reality, the membranes maybe stretched out or extended, and the entire progeny 

 loosened from all adherence or connection with them. 



The male organs of generation consist of two spermaries, a right and a left, 

 perfectly independent from one another, having each its separate duct, dis- 

 charging their contents into an elongated cloaca, into which the bladder, like- 

 wise, empties its contents. This cloaca communicates with the exterior by a 

 subcircular opening, the edge of which being rather protruding. Such is that 

 apparatus the same in its general structure as in the other osseous fishes. 

 There is no sheath enclosing the two spermaries, and this fact throws a con- 

 siderable light upon the morphology of the ovaries : the latter being in fact two 

 in number, but so closely connected together as to simulate a single organ. Thus 

 the general disposition, not the plan of structure, of these organs, is adapted to 

 the mode of reproduction a single sheath being a more simple adaptation than 

 two, one for each ovary. 



How the mechanical act of fecundation takes place we are not prepared to say 

 from direct observations ; the eggs themselves must be fecundated within the 

 ovarian sheath ; a copulation of some sort is therefore required, and it is not 

 improbable that at this period the eggs have dropped from the ovarian mem- 

 branes into the pouches, or spaces between these membranes, in which they are- 

 freely floating. 



The hatching of the embryos takes place at an early period. After leaving 

 the egg shell, they have an abdominal bag containing the remaining yelk, which 

 is to be gradually absorbed during a period when neither the mouth nor the 

 esophagus are formed ; the fins have not yet appeared. The visual organs begin 

 with a deposition of an external layer of black pimentum, in every respect similar 

 to the same organs in invertebrata. The head is anteriorly rounded, and the 

 cleft of the mouth not yet apparent at the period when the fins begin to develop, 

 The caudal has the start over all other fins ; its posterior margin is first lanceo- 

 lated, then rounded, with a convexity gradually diminishing until it is perfectly 

 straight, when a gradual emargination commences, and from a slight crescent 

 reaches the forked shape which it assumes in the adult. The soft and articulated 

 portion of the dorsal and anal fins, next assume a development reaching extra- 




320 [April, 



ordinary proportions, which they again gradually lose so soon as free from 

 parental sheltering. The posterior portion of these fins is especially to be no- 

 ticed, as longer or deeper than the anterior portion (the reverse of what we ob- 

 serve in the adult,) and extending generally beyond the base of the caudal fin, 

 a character, therefore, not exclusively proper to the genus Rhacocheilus. The 

 spinous portion of these same fins, on the other hand, develop but slowly and 

 gradually, reaching their full growth at a late period. The ventrals and pec- 

 torals are likewise tardy in their appearance. The scales are fully developed 

 before the young leave the ovary.

324 [April, 



Descriptions of New Species of Birds from Western Jfrica, in the collection of the 

 Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. 



By John Cassin. 



1. Bareatula Duchaillui, nolis. 



Form. About the size of Bucco philippensis, Briss. Wing with the first quill 

 spurious, fourth longest, but slightly longer than the fifth, tail somewhat rigid, 

 legs moderate, tarsi rather long, toes long. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin) male 5| inches, wing 3}, tail If inches. 



Colors. Throat, neck before and breast glossy blue-black, which color bifur- 

 cates and is continued on each side of the abdomen. Head above scarlet, aline 

 from above the eye running downwards, on the side of the neck, light sulphur 

 yellow. Upper parts black, with a steel blue lustre, the lesser wing coverts and 

 many feathers of the back with small cordate and oval spots of sulphur yellow, 

 greater wing coverts edged and feathers of the rump tipped with the same. Quills 

 brownish black, edged on their inner webs w T ith yellowish white, and on their 

 outer webs with sulphur yellow. Middle of the abdomen and ventral region 

 pale yellow, sides (from the breast to the flanks) and under tail coverts greenish 

 yellow, all the feathers of which are widely tipped with that color and black at 

 base. Tail brownish black, bill and feet dark. Female similar to the male, but 

 with the colors less vivid. Another specimen (female) has many of the^pots on 

 the upper parts changed to chestnut color, and a trace of the same on the sides. 



Hob, Moonda river, Western Africa, discovered by Mr. P. Belloni Du Chaillu. 



Obs. This handsome species, though apparently properly belonging to this 

 group of the Bucconince is unusually large. It does not closely resemble any 

 other with which I am acquainted in any considerable degree, though of the 

 general appearance of the smaller African species. 



This bird is named in honor of its discoverer, Mr. P. Belloni Du Chaillu, an 

 enterprizing young traveller, who has explored extensive and almost unknown 

 regions of Western Africa, near the Equator, and whose discoveries in zoological 

 and geographical science are in a high degree important and interesting. Mr. 

 Du Chaillu ascertained the existence of three ranges of mountains at a distance 

 of 150 miles from the coast, in which he traced the river Moonda to its source. 

 The birds described in the present paper were collected during his journey along 

 the course of this river. In his collection there are also numerous species hitherto 

 little known, of which, and of those now described, his ample and interesting notes 

 have been most kindly placed at my disposal, and will be published at my earliest 

 leisure. 



2. Barbatula fuliginosa, nobis. 



Form. About the size of the preceding. Bill short, straight, wide, first quill 

 spurious, fifth slightly longest, tail short, legs moderate, toes long. Belong ap- 

 parently to the genus Gymnobucco, Bonap., and much resembles Gymnobucco calvus 

 in form and color, but is smaller and has the head covered with feathers, and the 

 toes much longer. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin) male, 5f inches, wing3i, tail 2 inches. 



Colors. Head above dull yellow, throat cinereous, all other parts of the plumage 

 above and below fuliginous brown, some feathers on the abdomen, flanks and 

 rump obscurely edged with greenish yellow. Quills brown, paler on the inner 

 webs, tail dark brown, with a tinge of greenish yellow. Bill horn color, legs 

 dark. 



Ilab. Moonda river, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. Belloni Du Chaillu. 



Qbs. This species, of which Mr. Du Chaillu assures me that his specimens are 

 adult birds, and of which male, female, and young are in his collection, is very 

 similar to Gymnobucco calvus, Bonap., which is also in the collection of the 

 Academy. The head above, however, is not bare as in that species, but fully feather- 

 ed, and this bird is smaller, though the legs and toes are stronger, and the latter 

 much longer. The bill is very nearly of the same form as in that species, being 

 wider vertically and shorter than in other African birds of this group. This 




1855.] 325 



species and G. calvus probably form a distinct subgenus, but tbe name given to it 

 by the Prince of Canino is not appropriate so far as relates to our present bird. 



3. Diceum Rushi.e, nobis. Mrs. Rush's Warbler. 



Form. Very small, bill slender, curved, first quill spurious, fourth and fifth 

 longest and nearly equal, tail short, legs and feet rather stout. Plumage of entire 

 head and breast scule-like and rough to the touch. 



Dvmtnsions. Total length (of skin) male, 3 inches, wing If, tail 1 inch. Female 

 slightlv smaller. 



Colors. Every feather of the head above, neck, back, throat and breast with 

 a central line of brown (sienna) and edged with ashy white, tbe brown darkest 

 and predominating on the head, and palest but much predominating and giving 

 the prevailing color on the back ; the ashy white predominating on the throat 

 and breast. Abdomen, rump, and tail coverts above and below pale yellow, 

 tinged with greenish. Quills brown, edged with white on their inner webs, tail 

 dark brown, nearly black. Bill with the upper mandible black, under mandible 

 white at base and tipped with black, tarsi and toes light colored. Inferior coverts 

 of the wirgs white. 



Bab. Moonda river, Western Africa. Discovered bvMr. P. B. Du Chaillu. 



Obs. This is the most remarkable species in the present collection, and of its 

 generic relations I am by no means certain, though it appears to be most nearly 

 allied te the group in which it is at present placed. In its colors, however, it is 

 quite different from any other known species of this genus, and the scale-like 

 feathers of the head and breast are quite peculiar. 



This bird is dedicated to the lady of James Rush, M.D., of Philadelphia, who, 

 most ably seconding her distinguished husband in an enlightened encouragement 

 of men devoted to the sciences and to the arts, has exerted an influence in the 

 highest degree beneficial to their progress, and promotive of the true interests of 

 society. 



4. ^Egithalus flayifro.ns, nobis. 



Form. Bill straight, pointed, rather long, first quill spurious, third and fourth 

 longest and very nearly equal, tail rather short, legs long, rather robust. 



Dimensions. Male, total length (of skin) 3J inches, wing 2^, tail l\ inches. 



Colors. Forehead bright yellow, entire plumage of the upper parts olive green 

 tinged with yellow, lightest on the rump, quills and tail dark brown, the feathers 

 of both edged with yellowish green on their outer webs. Entire under parts 

 pale yellow, tinged with green. Inferior wing coverts white, bill and feet light 

 horn color. 



Hub. Moonda river, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Du Chaillu. 



Obs. Of the same form and about the size of JE. Smithi, but entirely different 

 in color, nor does it apparently intimately resemble any known species. 



5. Syncopta tincta, nobis. 



Form. Bill rather long, first quill spurious, fourth and fifth longest and very 

 nearly equal, tail moderate or rather short, legs long. Feathers of the back long 

 and hair-like. 



Dimensions. Male, (of skin) total length 4 inches, wing 2J, tail If inches. 



Colors. Head above, back and rump light cinereous, scapulars, wing coverts, 

 and outer edges of quills (especially the secondaries) yellowish green. Quills 

 and tail light hair brown. Throat, breast and sides light ashy, abdomen white, 

 tibiae ochre yellow, tinged with green. Edge of wings at the shoulders yellow, 

 inferior coverts white. Bill dark, tarsi and toes light colored. 



Bab. Moonda river, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Du Chaillu. 



Obs. The affinities of this genus are to the TimalincB. The present species is 

 rather smaller than Syncopta brevicaudata, but there is no considerable specific 

 similarity. It is in both the collections of Mr. Du Chaillu and Dr. MacDowell, 

 obtained by the latter on St. Paul's river. 



6. Sylvia prasixa, nobis. (Genus Chloropeta ?) 



Form. Bill rather strong, upper mandible somewhat curved, wing rather long, 




326 [April, 



first quill spurious, fourth longest, tail moderate, legs and toes rather long and 

 robust. 



Dimensions. Male, (of skin) total length 4 inches, wing 1\, tail If ioches. 



Colors. A line over and behind the eye pale yellowish white, another imme- 

 diately below it (through and behind the eye) and head above unifoim very dark 

 olive green. Back, rump, wings and tail dark olive green tinged with yellow, 

 especially on the rump and outer edges of the secondary quills. Entire under 

 parts very pale yellowish white, with a tinge of greenish ashy. Edge of the 

 wing at the shoulder pale yellow, axillaries and under coverts yellowish white, 

 bill dark, feet lighter. 



Hab. Moonda river, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Du Chaillu. 



Obs. Remarkable for its uniform dark green color and white superciliary line. 

 Of the generic relations of this bird I am not confident, but regard it as probably 

 a Chloropeta. 



7. Butalis inpuscatus, nobis. 



Form. Bill wide at base, rather short, wing long, first quill spurious, third 

 longest, tail moderate, slightly emarginate. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin) male, 4| inches, wing 3}, tail 2 inches. 



Colors. Entire plumage above fuscous, rather darker on the head, and paler 

 on the edges of the leathers of the back. Beneath fuscous, the edges of the 

 feathers paler and slightly tinged with pale rufous on the breast, abdomen and 

 under tail coverts, and on the throat (the edges of the feathers) with white. 

 Quills and tail dark fuscous. Bill and feet dark. Female similar to the male 

 but paler. 



Hab. Moonda river, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Du Chaillu. 



Obs. This bird appears to be allied to Muscicapa Fraseri, Strickland, but is 

 much smaller, and is in other respects quite distinct. 



8. Butalis epulatus, nobis. 



Form. Small, but very robust, bill moderate, wide at base, with several pairs 

 of bristles, wit>g rather long, first quill spurious, third and fourth longest and 

 very nearly equal, tail moderate. 



Dimensions Male, total length (of skin) 3| inches, wing 2^, tail 1J inches. 



Colors. Throat and middle of abdomen white, breast and flanks light cinereous. 

 Entire plumage above cinereous, lighter on the rump and darkest on the head, 

 quills brownish black, secondaries edged on their outer webs with light ash} 7 , 

 tail uniform brownish black, bill and feet dark, under mandible white at its base, 

 under wing coverts and axillary feathers white. 



Hab. Moonda river, Western Africa. Di- covered by Mr. P. B. Du Chaillu. 



Obs. A small but robust species apparently not nearly related to any other. 

 Its general form is much as though it had been accustomed to good cheer on the 

 banks of the river Moonda, or wherever else it may have found sufficient enter- 

 tainment. 



9. Pycnosphrys McCallii, nobis. (Genus Pi/znosphn/s, Strickland in Jard . 



Contr. 1849.) 



Form. Small, bill moderate, upper mandible curved, and with numerous pairs 

 of rather strong bristles at base, which are nearly as long as the bill. Wing 

 moderate, first quill spurious, fourth and fifth longest and very nearly equal, tail 

 rather long, legs moderate or rather long. Feathers on the head above some- 

 what elongated and probably erectile, feathers of the back lengthened. 



Dimensions. Total length, sex unknown, (of skin) 4 inches, wing If, tail If 

 inches. 



Colors. Head above and tail fine rufous, every feather of the former with a 

 central line of white, back, rump and wing coverts light cinereous, tinged with 

 rufous on the rump and darkest on the wing coverts, upper tail coverts rufous. 

 Throat and breast very pale reddish yellow, abdomen and under tail coverts 

 white, underwing coverts pale reddish yellow (uniform with the throat). Bill 

 and foet light colored. 




1855.] 327 



Hob. Moonda river, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Du Chaillu. 



Obs. Another bird, the generic position of which is to us uncertain. After 

 careful examination, however, it appears most properly belonging as we have 

 placed it. This species is strongly characterized by the bright rufous of its 

 head above and tail. 



This bird is named in honor of Col. Geo. A. McCall, late Inspector General in 

 the Army of the United States, in token of respect for hib extensive and varied 

 acquirements as a naturalist, and of personal friendship. 



10. Drymoica Bairdii, nobis. 



Form. Bill rather long, wing short, rounded, first quill short, fifth longest, 

 tail long, graduated, legs long, rather slender. 



Dimensions. Male, total length (of skin) 5f inches, wing 2, tail 3 inches. 



Colors. Middle of the abdomen white, entire under parts with regular trans- 

 verse narrow bands of dark brown, (nearly black) and white. Head above 

 asby brown, other upper parts dark brownish olive, coverts of the wings and 

 some of the shorter secondaries tipped with white. Quills hair brown, lighter 

 on the edges of both webs, tail hair brown, tipped with white, and a rather 

 obscure subterminal band of dark brown. Under wing coverts, white. Bill 

 and tarsi dark (nearly black, in skin). Female similar, but slightly smaller, 

 white space on the middle of the abdomen larger, tarsi lighter colored. 



Dab. Moonda river, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Du Chaillu. 



Obs. This species differs in colors from any other known to me, and the 

 transverse bands of the inferior surface of the body are, so far as I know, pecu- 

 liar to the present bird only of this genu^. 



This remarkable bird is dedicated to Professor Spencer F. Baird, of the Smith- 

 sonian Institution, one of the most eminent American naturalists, as a remem- 

 brancer of our long continued and pleasant friendship. 



11. Laniarius lepidus, nobis. 



Form Bill rather long, wide at base, much compressed towards the end, 

 which is hooked and conspicuously toothed, first quill nearly spurious, fifth 

 longest, tail rather long, feathers of the rump long and soft. Tarsi rather long. 



Dimensions. Total length, male (of skin), 9 inches, wing 4J, tail A\ inches. 



Colors. A spot before the eye white, the feathers of which are narrowly 

 tipped with black. Entire upper parts olive tinged with yellow, especially on 

 the rump, superior coverts of the wings greenish brown, every feather and the 

 exposed ends of the secondaries having a terminal spot of greenish yellow and 

 on their inner webs with pale yellow. Entire under parts of the body ashy 

 white, darker on the breast. Tibiae, flanks and under tail coverts yellow, the 

 former tinged with greenish. Tail yellowish olive tinged with yellow, and all 

 the feathers, except the two in the middle, tipped with pale yellow. Under wiug 

 coverts yellow. Bill and tarsi dark. 



Hub. Liberia. Rev. Wesley Johnson; St. Paul's river, Dr, MacDowall; 

 Moonda river, Mr. Du Chaillu. 



Obs. Though this singular species has long been in the possession of the 

 Academy, I have not found it described. It appears to be somewhat similar to 

 Laniarius peli, Bonap. (Consp. Av. p.* 360), but not identical, so far as can be 

 ascertained from the short description as cited. This bird can be easily recog- 

 nized by the white spots in front of the eye, the feathers of which are erect and 

 tipped witli black, and by the yellow spots at the tips of the wing coverts and 

 secondaries. 



12. Criniger xaxtiiogaster, nobis. 



Form. Bill rather long, slightly curved, wing with the first quill spurious, 

 fourth longest, tail rather long. Feathers of the rump somewhat lengthened 

 and soft. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin), male, 11 inches, wing 3f. tail 3} inches. 



Colors. Entire upper parts yellowish olive, the yellow more distinct on the 

 rump. Quills dark brown, edged on their outer webs with olive, and on their 




328 [April, 



inner webs with greenish yellow. Entire under parts light yellow, tinged with 

 olive green on the breast and sides, throat slightly mixed with white, and the 

 shafts of some of the feathers on the neck before white. Tail above dark olive, 

 beneath greenish yellow. Bill and feet light colored. 



Hab. Moonda river, Western Africa. Discovered by M. P. B. Du Chaillu. 



Obs. Apparently a Criniger, Temminck, and almost exactly resembles in color 

 Criniger ictericus, Strickland, of India, but is smaller, and otherwise different. 

 The only specimens that I have ever seen are in the present collection. 



13. Tricophorus leuccrus, nobis. 



Form. Bill wide at base, wing with the first quill subspurious, fifth quill 

 longest, tail moderate, with the feathers broad, tarsus and toes rather short. 

 Feathers of the rump lengthened and soft. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin), sex unknown, 7 inches, wing 4, tail 3 

 inches. 



Colors. Four middle feathers of the tail brownish black, other tail feathers, 

 (four on each side) white, tinged with yellow on their outer webs and tipped 

 with brown. Entire upper parts yellowish olive, darker on the head. Quills 

 dark brown, edged with yellowish green on their outer webs and with pale 

 ashy white on their inner webs. Entire under parts dark cinereous tinged with 

 yellowish green, under coverts of the tail yellowish white. Bill and feet dark. 



Bab. St. Paul's river. Discovered by Robert MacDowall, M.D. 



Obs. This is another bird which I have found some difficulty in assigning to 

 a genus. It can easily be recognised by its white tail feathers, as described 

 above. 



14. Phyllostrophus leucopleurus, nobis. 



Form. Bill moderate first quill short, fourth slightly longest, tail rather long, 

 tarsi and feet rather long, feathers of the head above somewhat scale-like. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin) sex unknown, 9} inches, wing 4J, tail 4|- 

 inches. 



Colors. Entire upper parts brown, with a slight tinge of yellowish on the 

 back and of ashy on the head. Quills brownish black edged with brown on 

 their outer webs and with ashy white on their inner webs. Throat and breast 

 ashy white tinged with brownish green on the breast, where many of the 

 feathers have central stripes of ashy white. Sides (under the wing) with a 

 large white space, abdomen and under coverts of the tail white, with a very 

 pale tinge of yellow. Tail brown, four outer feathers (on each side) widely 

 tipped with white. Bill and feet dark. 



Ilab. Moonda river, Western Africa. Discovered by M. P. B. Du Chaillu. 



Obs. One specimen only of this fine species is in the collection. It is 

 strongly characterised by the large white spaces on the sides, which are readily 

 observed on raising the wing. This bird may be related to Phyllastrephus capen- 

 .sis or P. senegalensis, of both of which indifferent figures and descriptions have 

 been given, but of which I have not seen specimens. 



Notice of Remarkable Strata containing the remains of Infusoria and Polytha- 

 lamia in the Tertiary Formation of Monterey , California * 



By William P. Blake, 



Geologist of the United States Pacific Railroad Survey in California. 



When in San Francisco, in June, 1854, 1 received a fragment of a white, porous 

 earth, resembling chalk ; but which, from its lightness and general characters, 



*This notice has been deferred in consequence of the expectation of receiving 

 from California a full suite of specimens collected at the locality, which 

 should have arrived by this time. The principal facts concerning the position 

 and geology of the deposits are now presented, and will be followed by more 

 important details regarding the chemical composition and organisms of the speci- 

 mens after they have been received. 




1855.] 329 



was considered to be infusorial.* A small piece, on being subjected to examina- 

 tion by the microscope, was found to contain innumerable discs and long cylin- 

 drical spicule and ring-like organic remains. A portion was then forwarded 

 to Prof. J. W. Bailey, of West Point, who, in his letter of acknowledgement, 

 thus remarks : lt The specimen from Monterey is rich in marine diatoms ; the 

 seive-like discs belong to the genus Cascinodiscus, but there are many other 

 very beautiful forms present. It is singulai that the deposit contains some species 

 which have only recently been detected as living species in the Pacific. It has 

 quite a modern look, and contains many species which could only have grown 

 in shallow water." 



I soon afterwards visited Monterey and examined the deposit. It is about two 

 miles distant in a south-east direction from the centre of the town, and forms a 

 portion of a hill which fronts the bay and rises on the east side of the stage-road 

 to San Francisco. This hill is between 500 and 600 feet high, and it is separated 

 from the bay by a broad, sandy plain, and a belt of sand-hills along the beach. 

 Groves of oak trees are found around the base of the hill, but towards its top it 

 is covered with a dense growth of chamisal,f throughjwhich the outcrop of the 

 white earth can be seen as a white spot on the hillside from all parts of the 

 town and the anchorage. On arriving at the locality, however, the white spot 

 which appeared so limited when viewed from the town, is found to have a length 

 of about one hundred feet, and a width of from 15 to 40. lt is also seen to ex- 

 tend in all directions under the vegetation by w r hich it is partly obscured. The 

 glossy green leaves of the shrubs which grow up about its borders, contrasted 

 strangely with the white, chalk-like earth, which seemed as little fitted for vege- 

 tation as a lime-heap. The weathering of the formation has loosened small 

 blocks and fragments, which lie upon the surface and hide the stratification from 

 view, so that it at first appears as a homogeneous mass of vast extent ; but on 

 breaking out some large blocks from a favorable exposure, the lines of stratifica- 

 tion became evident, and on a closer inspection they were seen to be as numerous 

 and thin as the leaves of a book. 



This out-crop appears to be the principal stratum, and it is near the top of the 

 hill ; but lower down a succession of strata are found alternating with siliceous 

 beds, which are peculiarly compact and very finely stratified. Some of these 

 are excessively hard, and break with a conchoidal fracture like flint or semi-opal. 

 The whole form a series of parallel strata which are not horizontal, but dip south 

 of east, or nearly south-easterly, at an inclination of from twenty to thirty de- 

 grees. The following is the succession of the strata from the upper stratum 

 downwards to the lowest point examined. 



The thicknesses stated are approximations.

thickness, and this is believed to be much less than it in reality is. The under- 

 lying strata, which are similar in their appearance, are probably equally fossili- 

 ferous, but this has not been demonstrated by examination. Their thicknesses 

 were respectively, 1, 12, 2 and 10 feet, which, added to the thickness of the 

 upper stratum, make a total of seventy-five feet. This is exclusive of the com- 

 pact siliceous strata, which are presumed to be also fossiliferous. These siliceous 

 layers are very extraordinary, some of them being like semi-opal in density, and 

 in the character of their fracture, the surfaces being curved and vitreous, and 

 the edges sometimes as sharp as glass. Their color varies from white to drab, 

 or fawn-color, and is sometimes pink ; some specimens resemble ivory or horn 

 in color and translucency. Silica appears to be the constituent, and it must have 

 been deposited in an impalpable form. The mineral characters of some of these 

 strata are like those of specimens of surf-worn boulders that I picked up on 

 the beach at San Pedro. These consist of silica charged with bitumen, and when 

 broken present a conchoidal fracture and a resinous appearance. It is expected 

 that these siliceous specimens will not only be interesting chemical^, but that 

 they will furnish beautiful objects for the microscope. 



On the top of this formation there is a rudely stratified or assorted mass of 

 boulders and gravel, like the accumulation along a beach. It is, in fact, a layer 

 of beach-shingle, and it includes, among pebbles of granite and other rocks, 

 water- worn masses of the compact siliceous rock, probably derived from the sub- 

 jacent beds. One of these siliceous masses that was dark colored and probably 

 bituminous, was found to be perforated by boring testacea. This was an unex- 

 pected and interesting discovery; for, here were masses of rocks of tertiary age 

 that had been exposed and perforated by marine shells before being broken off, 

 rounded and worn by the surf among other and harder rocks, and thrown on a 

 beach by the retiring waters. The beach still remains, and rests exposed on the 

 very summit of the hill, covering the edges of the strata a remnant of a for- 

 mer shore now five hundred feet above the ocean. 



This interesting formation, teeming with the skeletons of microscopic organ- 

 isms appears to overlie and to be conformable with the tertiary strata that 

 underlie a part of the town of Monterey and extend to and beyond the Mission 

 of San Carlos. These strata rest upon a porphyritic granite, which forms 

 the projection of the coast called Point Pinos, and is the bulwark of the bay. 



Several quarries have been opened in the sedimentary formation near the 

 town, and it is seen to consist of regular strata of light-colored argillaceous and 

 arenaceous material ; the particles being very fine and firmly impacted, so that, 

 in some places, the strata break with smooth, curved surfaces, and have a semi- 

 vitreous lustre. A large quantity oi stone has been removed from these quar- 

 ries and used in the construction of the buildings and walls of the town. The 

 large Court House built by Walter Colton, and the church erected in 1794, are 

 constructed of this stone, and the sharp edges and angles which are retained by 

 the blocks in the walls of the latter show that the material has great durability 

 and resists decomposition exceedingly well. 



When the blocks are freshly broken out from the quarry they are easily hewn 

 into shape by an axe ; being extremely light and free from coarse sand or 

 gravel. They harden slightly on exposure, but may be cut away with a knife. 

 The color is a light buff or yellow, of various shades, passing into fawn color 

 and drab ; some of the beds are quite dark, being greenish black, or a dark olive 

 brown. The prevailing color is, however, a light drab or yellow, very similar 

 to the color of bath brick or lithographic stone. It is not unlike the former in 

 density, being porous, and, when dry, ic absorbs water with rapidity ; in this 

 respect and in density, it also resembles biscuit-ware, or the material of the 

 porous cells of Grove's batteries. 



These strata are fossiliferous, and many of the compact layers when split up 

 into slabs parallel with the fine lines of stratification are found to be covered 

 with impressions of small bivalve shells, lying thickly together, sometimes one 

 within the other, as if they had fallen upon the bottom of a quiet sea. The 

 most abundant shell is a small Td-lina, which Mr. T. A. Conrad has described 

 for me and named T. coi/gesta. It is also found in similar strata at San Carlos, 




1855.] 331 



and is there associated with Lutraria Traslii, Conrad, also a new species. Im- 

 pressions of very small crabs have been fonnd in this rock, and I have also 

 seen wh^t appeared to be the marks of fucoides on the surfaces of ihe layers. 



A stratum of the Monterey formation similar in texture to the stone which is 

 used for building, but different in color, also contains casts of Tellina congesta 

 in great numbers. The color of this rock is a dark olive green or brown, but 

 when it has been weathered the surface is white. When it is dry it is very 

 light and adheres to the tongue, being very absorbent. Though soft and easily 

 cut with a knife it is very tough, and gives a ringing sound when struck by a 

 hammer, like a well baked tile. 



In addition to the Tellina and other fossil shells which this rock contains, it 

 is charged with innumerable and beautiful Polythalamia, (Foraminifera, D'Or- 

 bigny.) lying in thin layers through the mass and becoming visible in white 

 lines on the edges of the slabs. They may be seen with the naked eye, but the 

 assistance of the microscope is required to trace the forms of those that happen 

 to be exposed. They are very w r hite and perfectly preserved, and are exceed- 

 ingly beautiful objects for the microscope. It is, however, to be regretted that 

 the material in which they are preserved is so indurated and resisting that it is 

 impossible to get them out for study. Every cross fracture of the rock pre- 

 sents innumerable sections, and occasionally the full form of a shell is visible 

 on the surface. 



The rock has another interesting peculiarity, which must be mentioned it is 

 bituminous, and gives off an empyreumatic odor when it is heated before the 

 blowpipe flame. The specimens which I have are perforated by Petricola cylin- 

 dracea and other boring shells. 



The upper stratum of the formation at the quarries, which is overlaid by the 

 beach shingle before mentioned, is worn smooth and uneven, as if it had been 

 subjected to the action of the surf. It has been perforated by Tholadidce., and 

 their cells still remain. They are large and numerous, but no shell could be 

 found in them. They are tilled up with fine sea-sand, which indicate that the 

 shells must have been removed before the surface emerged from the tide. The 

 cells are in all respects similar to those now being formed and occupied in the 

 rocks of the beach. 



This locality is now at an elevation of about sixty feet above the beach and 

 one quarter of a mile from it. It presents convincing evidence of the compara- 

 tively recent elevation of the coast. 



The connection between the strata of siliceous infusoria and the strata con- 

 taining the Polythalamia has not been traced, but it is probable that the two 

 deposits are conformable, and parts of one great series. If this is so, we may 

 conclude that the intervening strata are also charged with fossils. The forma- 

 tion, so far as already known, is a wonderful record of life, and a rich mine of 

 results for the geologist and palaeontologist.

*Dr. Gambel described a Dipodomys under this name from Los Angeles, 

 but unfortunately omitted to mention any specific characters. Having re- 

 ceived specimens from this same locality, clearly referrible to D. philltpsii, I 

 was forced to consider Dr. Gambel's name as a synonym, his description apply- 

 ing as well to one as the other. I accordingly, in my notes, gave to the present 

 species the name of D. gambeli. As Dr. LeConte, in his masterly monograph 

 of the genus, ha? defined the same species with much precision under Dr. Gam- 

 bel's name, and is besides satisfied that it is really found at Los Angeles, with 

 the other, 1 have finally concluded it best to adopt the name of D. agilis, which, 

 however, is rather that of LeConte than Gambel.

Mr. Isaac Lea read a paper, intended for publication in the Proceed- 

 ings, entitled " Description of a new Mollusk from the Red Sandstone 

 near Pottsville, Penn. j" which was referred to Dr. Leidy, Dr. Wilson 

 and Mr. Vaux. 



Dr. Leidy stated that he had received from Dr. Nott the bones of the 

 so-called fossil man, exhibited in New Orleans several years since. The 

 skeleton was 18 feet in length. There were two molar teeth, each 

 weighing two pounds, and the fragment of a canine. The bones are 

 those of the Mastodon. Dr. Leidy described the mode in which the 

 skeleton was made up. 



Dr. Leidy also announced to the Society that the fine skeleton of the 

 Narwhal, (Monodon monoceros) which had been presented by Dr. Kane 

 in 1851, had been mounted, and was now in the Museum.

The Committee to which was referred the following paper, by Mr. 

 Isaac Lea, reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings : 



Description of a new Mollusk from the Red Sandstone near Pottsville, Pa. 



By Isaac Lea. 



A few weeks since Dr. Leidy had the kindness to place in my hands an in- 

 teresting specimen, consisting of a cast of a bimusculose mollusk which that 

 gentleman had found last summer at Tumbling Run dam, about a mile south- 

 east of Pottsville. 



The discovery of this small specimen in these Red Sandstones (Formation No. 

 11 of the Pennsylvania Survey, by Prof. Rogers) is of great importance, as it is 

 believed to be the first mollusk which has been observed in these Red Sandstones, 

 underlaying the conglomerate of the coal measures of Schuylkill County, known 

 as the southern coal field of Pennsylvania, and consequently congenerie with 

 the Sauropus primcevus , Lea, and Plumites, Rogers.* 



The extreme paucity of organic life yet observed in these Red Sandstones ex- 

 cites the more interest, as the fact of such deficiency of types renders the position 

 of this formation in the series a matter of doubt in the minds of some geologists. 



It is hoped that by patient' research other mollusks may be discovered, and 

 that, by the palaeontology of this portion of the Palaeozoic rocks, its true position 

 may be determined. 



The specimen is simply a cast of the exterior of the two valves, entirely 

 flattened out. In its facies it approaches the Cypricardia rhombea, Phill., (Geology 

 of Yorkshire, pi. 5, f. 10,) from the Mountain Limestone of Northumberland, 

 England. It is, however, rather more quadrate, and is a much smaller shell. It 

 has strong affinities to Posidonia, particularly in the strice, and may possibly 



* Mr. Hall, in the New York Reports, part 4, p. 292, describes a Cypricardia 

 (contracta) from the " Conglomerate and Sandstone" under the great western 

 coal measures, near Panama, Chatauque County. It is quite oblong, and of much 

 greater breadth and of a larger size than the species described herein.

belong to that genus which seems to exist first in the Upper Silurian, and to rise 

 to the superior portion of the Jurassic Formation. It also resembles the Microdcn 

 ballastriata, Con., (Hamilton Group,) described in the New York Reports, part 4, 

 page 196, Geology, by James Hall. 



As the exterior form only is visible, the diagnosis must necessarily be very 

 curt. It may be thus characterized until better specimens shall be obtained. I 

 name it after Dr. Leidy, who first discovered it.

Dr. Hallowell read a letter from Mr. Charles J. Gilman, dated 



Brunswick, Maine, 1855, inclosing the following communication 



from Mr. James E. Powell, a hunter in that State : 



" In regard to the moose, I speak of it only as I am acquainted with it in 

 this State (Maine), other latitudes causing some slight variation in its habits. 



When the snows have left the ground entirely bare, which, in the favorite 

 haunts of the moose, happens about the middle of May, they leave their winter 

 haunts and approach the marshes, ponds and rivers, where they come to search 

 for their summer food, consisting of all the various aquatic plants which flourish 

 in this region. Their favorite food, however, is the water lily and rush, in all 

 their varieties, and at this season they crop them as soon as they appear, close 

 to the bottom, frequently holding their heads under water a minute or eighty 

 seconds, and often wading in water so deep that when they put their heads down 

 under the surface, to obtain the small lily leaves or to dig up the root of the 

 plant (which they often eat at this season), before the leaves are plentiful, only 

 a portion of the back is visible. About this time the females go apart, seeking 

 the most impenetrable thickets that border on or are near water, and there bring 

 forth their young ; those of three years old and upwards almost invariably 

 producing two. Still I have occasionally, but very rarely, seen and known 

 three at a birth. Those of two years old never produce more thaa one. They 

 shed their coats of long, rough hair, too, at this period, and are soon covered 

 with short, smooth, fine hair, of a dark brown color, which, however, soon 

 becomes a jetty, glossy black on the sides and back and grey on the legs (with 

 the exception of one variety of the animal, which is of a grey color, and which 

 is now very scarce here.) As the season advances, the moose frequent the water 

 still more, and remain in it longer at a time. In May, or early in June, they 

 seldom stay in it more than half an hour at once, but in July and August they 

 sometimes remain in the water several hours, and also frequent the waters very 

 much during the night, especially in hot, dry, sultry weather, or thunder 

 storms, which they seem particularly to delight in, swimming back and forth, 

 apparently in a high state of enjoyment. During these visits to the water, the 

 female, or cow, secretes her young with great care, to protect them from the 

 ferocity of the old bulls that would destroy them. For this purpose they com- 

 monly select a very dense clump of large bushes, or a spruce or fir thicket, which, 

 by its density, prevents the bull from reaching them, on account of his horns, 

 which generally sprout in April. They grow rapidly, and are very tender and 

 easily hurt at this time. By September the horns are out of the velvet, and 

 have acquired hardness, and towards the close of this month the rutting season 

 commences, and the moose leave the water for two or three weeks and resort to 

 the mountains. At this period the bulls are frequently very fat (I have killed 

 them with nearly three inches in thickness of fat on the rump), and are often 

 very fierce and savage, sometimes even attacking the hunter, but in the course 

 of a few weeks they become thin and poor, in consequence of their continual 

 roaming and their many combats, the effects of jealousy. They also neglect 

 food at this time. At this period the loud bellow of the bull, or the sonorous 

 'call' of the cow is frequently heard and distinguished by the watchful hunter 

 at the distance of two or three miles, in the stillness of night. The bulls also 

 make another noise, which, from its peculiar sound, the hunters call chopping; 

 it i3 produced by forcibly bringing together and separating the jaws in a pecu- 

 liar and singular monner, and (as its name implies) resembles the sound of an 

 axe, used at a great distance. They also emit a variety of strange sounds and 

 cries. When they return to the water they spend a great deal of time in it for 

 a week or two, but afterwards they gradually shorten their visits, until the 

 sharp frosts set in. Still, they occasionally come into it, till ice forms an inch 




1855.] 343 



thick during the night. Then tbey leave and return to the mountains, where 

 they select their fall and winter haunts, roaming about and subsisting on the 

 bark of small trees, which tbey peel or gnaw off, and the twigs of the fir tree 

 and other woods. When the deep snows fall, they select a spot well adapted to 

 their wants, and commence to browse and peel more closely. This is called 

 1 yarding,' and as the snow deepens and crusts form on its surface, they peel and 

 break down bushes and browse closely, in preference to wallowing through the 

 snow in search of choicer food. A ' moose yard ' frequently occupies about one 

 hundred acres, more or less, but the latter few weeks of the season is frequently 

 spent on an area of ten acres, or less. The old males and females never 'yard ' 

 together, but sometimes young bulls and cows are found occupying the same 

 1 yard.' Still they are seldom found in close company. Cows and tbeir calves 

 frequently yard together, the calves remaining with the mother one year. The 

 oldest buils invariably yard alone, choosing some lonely knoll or mountain 

 peak, where they reside in utter solitude. Indeed, as age increases, the moose 

 become more solitary in their habits, avoiding the common resorts of other 

 moose, and frequenting some lone little pond or stream. The moose of two and 

 three years old, also, often yard alone, but the males between the ages of three 

 and ten years are very gregarious. I have known as many as nine in one yard. 

 When hunted at this time (deep snow) they go off in Indian file, each moose 

 stepping accurately in the footprints of its predecessor, so that any but an ex- 

 perienced hunter would scarcely suppose that more than one moose had passed, 

 when perhaps six or seven had gone in reality. Still, when they are closely 

 pursued, and the one that is first becomes tired, (in consequence of having to 

 break the way through the snow,) that one turns out a very little, and (the rest 

 having passed him) brings up the rear. So they change in rotation, the males 

 showing the most chivalrous spirit in aiding the females or the weaker ones. 

 Sometimes, too, they break their order of going in awkwardly passing a tree, 

 when hard pressed, some going on each side, but instantly falling into line 

 again when the obstacle is passed. At this season the ' spikehorn,' or two-year- 

 old bull, is noted as affording the longest and most difficult chase, and the 

 oldest bulls for making the most gallant fight. In fact, they often refuse to run 

 at all. 



A ' moose-yard ' presents a strange sight to those not familiar with it, with 

 its broken bushes and peeled trees ; for sometimes, when the snow is very deep 

 and difficult for them to get through, they break down and browse closely the 

 tops of young fir trees five or six feet from the ground, and where they are two 

 or three inches in diameter. They also reach up and peel and browse ten or 

 twelve feet high above the ground, raising the fore legs and allowing the weight 

 of the body to rest on the hind ones. Although so fond of browsing the fir, 

 they never eat the bark of it, yet they seldom kill any other tree, as they gene- 

 rally peel only one side of those they use for food ; tbey also break down the 

 bushes in one direction, pulling them towards them ; so that the direction the 

 moose has taken is known to the hunter by this sign, when he first approaches 

 a ' yard.' The young fir-trees are killed by the bulls rubbing their heads against 

 them, instinct teaching them in that manner to apply the balsam of fir (which 

 possesses great healing: powers) to the sore and tender places caused by the 

 loosening and falling off of the horns. 



The favorite winter food of the moose is the twigs of the fir tree and the bark 

 of the mountain ash, and of a species of dwarf maple, and the young twigs of 

 the ' moosewood.' 



During the summer the females are often seen accompanied by their two 

 calves, but in the winter there is seldom more than one calf found with each 

 cow. From this I infer that the young of the moose are subject to many dan- 

 gers. The cow gives an abundance of milk, and the growth of the moose is 

 very rapid for the first three years It possesses immense strength and is capable 

 of enduring long continued exertion and very great fatigue. It consumes very 

 little food in proportion to its size, and, during the winter, seldom drinks, 

 quenching its thirst with snow. Yet it very often chooses its yarding place near 




344 [June, 



or on some little streamlet, perhaps on account of its favorite maple being most 

 abundant in such places. 



The age of the moose is not great. I have never known but one to at- 

 tain the age of twenty years ; in fact, it is a rare and uncommon thing to 

 find one tbat has attained the age of fifteen years. It possesses a quick 

 ear and very strong, keen scent, and differs from most other wild animals 

 in regard to its desire to attack a person bearing a torch, or rather the 

 torch itself. For instance, in bunting on a dark night, in a canoe, on the water, 

 when in pursuit of deer, &c, a flambeau, or torch, or candle, can be used to 

 great advantage, the animals being apparently bewildered or fascinated by the 

 bright, steady light which approaches them so noiselessly and still; but the 

 moose, as soon as he perceives it, approaches it, quickening his pace as he comes 

 nearer, till (unless utterly disabled by the deadly rifle shot) he charges full upon 

 it, destroying the canoe, and frequently injuring its occupant. However, with 

 the extinction of the torch his fury ceases. The moose is easily tamed, and when 

 domesticated, exhibits much sagacity, and, if well treated, a very affectionate 

 disposition. I kept a young one (one year old) a short time, which mani- 

 fested as much docility and affection as a pet lamb. But when insulted or injured 

 they are very revengeful and unforgiving. In reference to which I will relate 

 an anecdote. 



The moose above alluded to was a great favorite with a young girl, who used 

 to visit him several times a day, playing with him and giving him such delicacies 

 as were most grateful to his epicurean palate (by the way, he acquired a strong 

 predilection for boiled, mashed potatoes), and the moose alwavs showed the 

 greatest pleasure when she was present. But one day, in a frolicksome mood, 

 she bound some gaily colored ribbons in her hair, leaving the ends loose and 

 fluttering, surmounting the whole by a tall and flaunting plume. Thus attired 

 she slowly approached the moose, while we stood watching and wondering how 

 he would recognize her. At length, gently and in perfect silence, she stood 

 beside the moose, and he slowly and haughtily turned his head, surveying her 

 strange appearance with the most ineffable contempt. At last, utterly unable 

 to repress her mirth at the ridiculous scene, she gave way to a fit of loud joyous 

 merriment. The wonted sound seemed to affect the moose, and he partially 

 turned his head away, then took another survey of her strange appearance and 

 his eyes suddenly lit up with a red, savage, fiery light, and he struck her forcibly 

 with his fore foot, and, had it not been for instant assistance, would probably 

 have killed her. He never afterwards would permit her to approach him, 

 showing signs of discontent and anger if she came within ten or twelve rods 

 of him, and if (when at liberty in the field) he ever saw her he would instantly 

 rush to attack her. Two or three times, when escaping into the house, she 

 had not time time to shut the door, and the revengeful beast followed her 

 into the rooms, to the great detriment of the furniture. We have often heard 

 of a bull in a crockery shop, but fancy a moose in a parlor. And if I was not 

 present, no other person could eject him, but he would instantly come at my call 

 and be obedient and submissive ; and if at any time this strange creature fancied 

 itself not sufficiently noticed or petted by me, it would utter most piteous cries 

 until it attracted attention. 



The animal in a wild state is very lithe and supple, turning itself about and 

 bending its form as easily as an ordinary dog, frequently standing in the most 

 singular postures. It also frequently crawls on its knees, to pass under logs, 

 &c, and drinks, in very shoal water, in the same position. 



I am afraid I have wearied you with my tediousness, but vouch for the facts 

 above stated, every one of which I know from actual observation and experience."

Notes on the Amar^e of the United States. 

 By John L. Le Conte, M. D. 



Although most of the Amarae found in our country have already been made 

 known, the labor of determining species from the scattered descriptions of vari- 

 ous authors is very great. I have therefore thought that it might give some aid 

 to the final arrangement of the .synonymy of this genus, to bring; together the 

 diagnoses of those known to me by specimens, as a definite basis would thus be 

 established for comparison of types of the species in other collections, not ac- 

 cessible to me ; and even where the names and synonyms adopted by me would 

 be found faulty, a method of eliminating the errors resulting from differences in 

 style of descriptions would be avoided. 



In the arrangement of the species, nothing can be better than the divisions 

 proposed by Dr. Zimmermann, although they cannot be admitted as of generic 

 value. The only alteration I have made is the suppression of Percosia as not 

 sufficiently distinct from Celia. They are as follows :

 Dr. Zimmermann, probably not having seen the male of this species, places it

 pubescent internally.

One female found on the north shore of Lake Superior, I formerly considered 

 this as Curtonotus convexiusculus Steph. (Kiiby, Fauna Bor. Am. 35), but on com- 

 parison with English specimens it proves entirely different. From that, as from 

 our other species, it differs by its narrower form, longer elytra, less rounded, but 

 more sinuate sides of the thorax, and more prominent posterior angles.

One male found at San Diego, California. Narrower than the following 

 species, and with the thorax more narrowed at the base, and more strongly 

 sinuated on the sides. From the preceding, which it resembles in the form, it 

 differs by the basal impressions of the thorax being deeper, and hardly btstriate, 

 by the posterior angles being somewhat less prominent, by the elytra being less 

 parallel, comparatively shorter and more obtusely rounded at the extremity.

 less rounded, and less suddenly sinuate towards the base, and the basal angles 

 although rectangular are less prominent ; the sides are slightly flattened about 

 the middle. The insect from Russian America referred by Mannerheim to this 

 species is much smaller and otherwise different ; it will be found below as 

 A. i n f a u s t a .

Russian America. Specimens have been kindly furnished me under the 

 names above cited by Baron Chaudoir and Mr. Motschulsky. It is a narrower 

 and smaller species than A. carinata, and the basal impressions, although very

deep, are more distinctly bistriate ; the thorax is also less narrowed towards the 

 base, and the elytra are less flattened on the disc. I have changed the name on 

 account of Curtonotus rufimanu s Kirby, Fauna Bor. Am. 35.

Russian America; a specimen sent by Mr. Motscbulsky. This species re- 

 sembles precisely in its form the preceding, but the basal impressions of the 

 thorax are less deep and more distinctly bistriate, and the external carina is 

 broader and less acutely elevated: the sides of the thorax are also somewhat 

 less rounded.

Leirus Eschscholtzii Chaudoir, Bull. Mosc. 1S37, 7, 36. 



Sitkha ; a specimen received from Baron Chaudoir. Very similar to the pre- 

 ceding, but with narrower, more parallel, and more convex elytra ; the thorax 

 is broader and more rounded on the sides, and the basal impressions are less 

 distinctly bistriate ; the antennae are broken in my specimen, only two points 

 remaining ; these are rufous, but the others are described as being dark colored : 

 the feet are entirely black, and the postpectus is punctured. 



I have omitted the reference to Mannerheim's description, because he states 

 that the sides of the thorax are rounded to the base, while in the specimen before 

 me they are as much sinuated as in A. melanogastrica, and because I have re- 

 ceived from Mr. Motschulsky, under the same name, a specimen in which the 

 sides of the thorax are not at all sinuous, and the feet are rufous, as described 

 by Mannerheim.

Lake Superior, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nebraska. The reference of this insect 

 to Amara hyperborea Dej. (Sp. Gen. 5, 800) is not warranted by the context ; 

 since that species is compared with A. fodi?i<z, it must be inferred that it 

 belongs to the preceding division of the genus, in the neighborhood of A. obtusa . 

 Curtonotus latior Kirby may possibly be identical with the present species, but 

 tbe bifid tooth of the mentum is insisted on so strongly, as proving that it 

 belongs to the division with A. co?ivexiuscula y &c, that without reference to 

 the type the synonym cannot be prudently adopted; under these circumstances 

 I am compelled to propose a new specific name.

 with the striae not deeper behind, and finally by the antennae being darker, with 

 only three joints pale. 



The synonym belongs to a dark colored variety, with greenish reflexions.

San Francisco, California, not rare. This species varies somewhat in the punc- 

 tuation of the striae of the elytra, and the sides of the abdomen ; sometimes the 

 punctures are quite distinct, while at others they can hardly be seen : the para- 

 pleurae are, however, always marked with a few punctures. 



A single specimen (male) is much narrower than the others, having the pro- 

 portions of A. angustata, and the thorax is less narrowed anteriorly ; it possibly 

 indicates a nearly allied species, but in the absence of other specimens, it would 

 be unsafe to separate it.

 described, but the third joint of the antennae is not at all carinated : the flatten- 

 ing of the sides of the thorax is a deceptive c'.iaiacter, and is sometimes hardly 

 visible. From the following four species it differs by the t'lorax being more

Synopsis of the Hydrophilid;e of the United States. 

 By John L. Le Conte, M.D. 



The species of th ; s family seem to have been treated with undeserved neglect, 

 and in fact there is in their general appearance a sameness, and in the parts of 

 the body where, specific characters are usually to be seen, a uniformity of structure 

 which does indeed tend to render the study of them very monotonous : yet on 

 comparing portions of the body not usually seen, the sternum and adjoining 

 parts, differences will be found in many cases, which if not associated with the 

 closest resemblance in form and manner of life would determine the formation 

 of a large number of genera. Nevertheless the genera, as evidenced by external 

 character, appear separated by characters of still greater magnitude, as may be 

 seen from the following scheme of our native genera which is partly arranged 

 from the excellent labors of Lacordaire (Genres des Coleopteres, 1, 448 and sq.) 

 I have merely replaced some of the characters by those given by Erichson, and 

 have suppressed Volvulus and Tropisternus ai being founded on insufficient 

 characters, and inverted the order of some of the primary divisions.

Abundant in the Middle States, at Lake Superior, and in Nebraska. The under 

 surface as usual is black, the oral organs, the feet and inflexed margin of the 

 prothorax are testaceous. Of the markings of the elytra, the most obvious are 

 an inverted V at the suture, and two small rounded spots each side, all behind 

 the middle. Sometimes the thorax is almost entirely brassy green, but the in- 

 flexed pan always retains a testaceous tint. The very small specimens are found 

 at Lake Superior, and are accompanied by others of the usual size.

Helophorus consimilis Mannb. ibid. 1853. 



Russian America, Baron Chaudoir; one specimen, from Eagle Harbor, Lake 

 Superior. Easily known by the deeper and more coarsely puuctured striae, and 

 the unequal elevation of the intermediate spaces of the elytra: the elevation of 

 the 7th interstice is greater towards the base. 



The specimen sent to me as H. consimilis only differs from the type in being 

 less dark. It may be doubted whether this is different from H. auricollis 

 Esch. (Entomographien, 43: Mannb. Bull. Mosc. 1843, 260) described from

Le Conte, Agassiz' Lake Superior, 217. 



Very abundant at Lake Superior. The third interstice has four elevations, one 

 of which is at the base, the fifth has three, and the seventh has two besides the 

 humeral carina : there is also on the ninth interstice a small tubercle near the 

 tip. These tubercles are arranged so as to form oblique series, which are parallel 

 with the oblique impression behind the base of the elytra. This species is cer- 

 tainly allied to, if not identical with H. tuberculatus of Northern Europe, but I 

 have not had the opportunity of comparing specimens, nor can I find any de- 

 scription sufficiently precise to warrant their union. 



H. angustulus Mannerh. (Bull. Mosc. 1853) from Russian America, is 

 unknown to me. It seems allied to H. linearis Lee, but the anterior angles of 

 the thorax aie described as being very much produced and acuminate.

One specimen from Louisiana, sent me by Mr. Wapler. This species is allied

Middle States, not common. This species is the largest I have seen, and is 

 readily distinguished. The two posterior foveae of the thorax are the basal im-

 they are hardly wider than the rows of punctures.

One specimen from Louisiana, Mr. Wapler. Of the same size and form as

 elytra. 



Head and thorax coarsely and moderately densely punctured, the latter a little 

 longer than wide, gradually narrowed to the ba3e, sides subsinuate, distinctly 

 crenulated : disc with three anterior and two posterior foveae, which are large 

 and moderately deep : at the posterior angles, which are obtuse, are other small 

 but deep foveae. The elytra are elongate, wider than the thorax, strongly crenato- 

 striate, with the interstices narrow ; the suture, the 5th, 7th and 9th are elevated, 

 the three latter interrupted behind the middle, giving the appearance of a lateral 

 transverse impression ; the fourth is elevated adjacent to the interruption of the 

 third : on the 3d and 4th interstices near the middle is seen a broad fovea tinged 

 with purple, and a slight impression is also seen behind the humerus, and yet

One specimen from Louisiana was given me by Dr. Schaum. This species is 

 closely related to the preceding, but tbe color is darker, and the inequalities of 

 the elytra are much less apparent, the fifth interstice is elevated about the middle

 elevated : the 8th insterstice is slightly foveate at the middle, and there is a faint 

 impression behind the humerus. /

Middle and Southern States. Closely related to the preceding, but distinguished 

 by the thorax being less narrowed behind, and the interstices of the elytra being 

 distinctly wider than the stria?. Dr. Melsheiraer's description reads, " elytra 

 strongly crenate striate, interstices fine, elevated, second, third and fourth lines 

 with interruptions at the middle." In comparison with other species these 

 characters are liable to produce error, and I therefore subjoin a new description. 



Elytra wider than the thorax, strongly crenate striate, with the interstices 

 convex but distinctly wider than the striae ; the suture is slightly elevated, the 

 fifth elevated posteriorly and interrupted, adjacent to the interruption the fourth 

 is elevated, the outer ones are also slightly undulated and elevated about the 

 middle: on the third interstice are three small purple spots, and the interrupted 

 portion of the sixth is also purple.

Haldeman, Stansbury's Exped. to Great Salt Lake, 375. 



Fort Gates, Texas; for the typical specimen collected by Lieut. Haldeman, I am 

 indebted to his brother, Prof. S. S. Haldeman. The dorsal foveas of the thorax 

 are larger and the external basal fovea? much smaller than in the next species 

 to which this related, and the elevations of the elytra are much more distinct. 

 They are slightly mottled with dark gray; the punctures are very large, and not 

 closely placed ; the interstices are scarcely wider than the stria? : the suture, 

 3d, 5th, 7th and 9th interstices are more elevated, the 3d and 5th are interrupted 

 behind the middle; the posterior part of the 3d is similar in elevation to the 

 anterior part and extends to the tip, but the fifth rises into a somewhat abrupt 

 callus ; the fourth interstice adjacent to the interruption is slightly elevated. 



Mr. Haldeman has incaatiously stated that this species is allied to H. 

 scabratns, but its form is quite different, and an attentive examination shows 

 but little affinity between them.

 finer. There is hardly any distinct inequality to be observed, though the fifth 

 interstice is slightly elevated behind the middle. 



Dr. Zimmermann once wrote me that this species had been found by him in

362 [June, 



One specimen found at Eagle Harbor, Lake Superior. The description given 

 by me is imperfect, on account of the thin margins of the thorax having been 

 partly destroyed in the only specimen obtained : thus I have stated that the 

 thorax was sinuous on the sides, while in reality the outline of the disc only is 

 sinuous ; the lateral margins of the thorax being continuous and regular in their 

 outline. The discovery of the next specimen, which is precisely similar in 

 sculpture, though only half as large, has enabled me to correct this error.

 is not mentioned by him, although he states that the longitudinal lateral impres- 

 sions are almost wanting. Notwithstanding these discrepancies, I must regard 

 my specimens as authentic, one of them having been received by me from Dr, 

 Schaum as a type.

San Diego, California, abundant : found also at Sacramento by Messrs. Child 

 and Wittick. The tip of each elytron is slightlyemarginate, with a smallbut acute 

 spine at the outer angle of the emargination. The medial vitta of the thorax is 

 composed of two confluent or closely approximated vittae : at times the vittae 

 are so dilated that they all become confluent, and the disc of the thorax presents 

 a large brassy green irregular spot, and the margins are yellow : at other times 

 the lateral vittae are attenuated anteriorly, so as to appear like subbasal spots 

 with narrow anterior prolongations. The species is readily known from all 

 others here described by the very dense and rugous punctuation of the elytra.

 the interstices are flat, sparsely punctured, with an irregular series of larger 

 punctures between the 2d and 3d. The spots are scattered ; several are conflu- 

 ent before the middle near the suture, while those behind the middle form two 

 angulated lines confluent externally about the Gth interval, with an opposite spot

364 [June, 



North Carolina, Dr. Zimmermann. The elongate oval body, and deep elytral 

 striae will distinguish this species, which seems to be variable in character. The 

 head of the male in my possession is entirely bronzed ; the thorax without any 

 distinct spots, and the elytra each with four spots, viz : one humeral, one on the 

 2d and 3d intervals before the middle, one on the same intervals behind the 

 middle, and the fourth on the 9th interval about the middle : the elytra are 

 separately prolonged into a very short point at the tip. In the female the head 

 like the rest of the upper surface is grayish testaceous, with only the occiput 

 bronzed : the thorax anteriorly has two dark discoidal spots ; the elytra besides 

 the spots above mentioned have a dark spot on the fifth and sixth intervals about 

 the middle, and their tips are prolonged conjointly into a moderately long and 

 acute spine.

Fort G ites and Fredericksburg, Texas ; Lieut. Haldeman. The spots are ar- 

 ranged as in the second specimen of the preceding species, and the W-shaped 

 mark is formed by the confluence of the posterior ones ; the humeral dot and 

 the one on the 9th interval are 'sometimes visible, but are frequently wanting. 

 It is scarcely necessary to mention that the scutellum. as in other species, is 

 brassy.

Middle and Southern States, not rare. Varies very much in color, the spots 

 of the thorax being sometimes reduced to two small points, while at others they 

 are expanded and confluent, so as to leave only the sides and apical margin tes- 

 taceous. The elytra are spotted as in B. aculeatus, above described ; the spots 

 are, however, at times nearly obliterated. What especially distinguishes the 

 species is the deeper longitudinal impression of the vertex, which gives the ap- 

 pearance of two very flattened interocular tubercles, as described by Herbst. 

 Dr. Melsheimer's species is known to me by his kindness in furnishing me with 

 a typical specimen.

Say, Jonrn. Acad. Nat. Sc. 5, 188. 



Middle States, abundant; for a typical specimen I owe my acknowledgments 

 to Dr. Melsheirner. This species is nearly related to several others. From the 

 preceding it may be known, as already stated, by the small punctures of the 

 elytra being almost placed in series, by the large punctures of the 3d, 5th and 

 7th intervals being less conspicuous, by the punctures of the stria? being larger, 

 and finally by the thorax being less densely punctured. 



From B. infuscatus it differs by the stria? of the elytra being strongly impressed, 

 especially towards the tip: 



9. B.infuscatus, ovalis, convexus griseo-testaceus, saepe obscurus niti- 

 dus, capite seneo sat dense punctato, thorace modice punctato, vittis dnabus

 niger, pedibus testaceis. Long. -23. 



Middle and Southern States, not rare; specimens from New Orleans were given 

 me by Dr. Schaum and Col. Motschulsky. This species is a little narrower than 

 B. s t r i a t u s, but the most reliable difference is found in the elytral striae, 

 which are fine, and sometimes almost obsolete towards the base.

One specimen, New York. Resembles B. fraternus in having the thorax some- 

 what densely punctured, but differs by the larger size and more regular arrange-

Colorado River, California; also found by Dr. i'hos. H. Webb at the Copper- 

 Mines of the Gila. Also resembles the four preceding; the striae of the eljtra 

 are fine and well impressed, growing a little deeper behind ; they arc finely punc- 

 tured, as in B. ordinatus and fraternus, but the interstitial punctuies are much 

 smaller. The thorax is less narrowed anteriorly, so that the body is less attenu- 

 ated in front. The spots of the elytra are arranged in three oblique series ; they 

 are placefl as follows : two on the 2d : three on the 3d ; one on the 4th ; three on 

 the 5th; one (humeral) on the 6th ; and one on the 9th and 10th. According 

 to a specimen sent by Mr. Motschulsky, this is B. californicusl of bis catalogue 

 of Russian ITydrocanthares. The specimen is more shining, and its thorax is 

 more densely punctured, but is hardly sufficiently different to indicate another 

 species ; it was found in the valley of the Sacramento.

New Orleans; this interesting discovery we owe to Mr. Wapler. The strie of 

 the elytra are obliterated at the base, and the inner ones are more so than the 

 outer ones ; by this means the short basal stria seen between the first and second 

 in the species above described here becomes wanting. The thorax is broadly 

 rounded at base, and emarginate at tip ; these curves converge rapidly towards 

 the sides, which are thereby very much shortened, and the form becomes lunate 

 with rounded angles ; the punctures are small, but more distinct at the sides 

 than on the disr*. This species belongs to Volvulus (Brulle,) but the reasons 

 given by Erichson (Kafer Mark Brand. 204) fur uniting Volvulus with Berosus 

 are so just, that I have adopted his conclusions. 



B. maculo sus Mannerh. Bull. Mosc. 1853, from Russian America, is un- 

 known to me. It must be allied to B. punctatissimus, but differs in being only 

 finely and not densely punctured.

New York, Georgia, Texas, Nebraska, California. The anterior tarsi of the 

 male are more compressed than in the female, the last joint is dilated into a 

 sharp edged somewhat warped surface, and the claws are very unequal and not 

 toothed. In the female the claws are equal and* armed beneath with a large 

 acute tooth. The Californian specimens are scarcely perceptibly less attenuated 

 at each end, but do not seem sufficiently distioct to be considered a different 

 species. Col. Motschulsky, to whom I gave specimens for comparison, informs 

 me that it really is his H. lugubris, but that the short description given by him 

 is erroneous, having been drawn partly from another very different species from 

 the Philippine Islands. 



The last mentioned synonym was founded on two specimens from the Gila, 

 brought by Dr. Webb; at first sight they appeared to constitute a separate spe- 

 cies, the elytra being marked by several shallow but broad grooves; on examin- 

 ing them again, I am convinced that, although they agree in this character, it 

 must be regarded as a malformation ; as I find on the sternum and other parts 

 of the body corrugations which are the result of injury or disease ; and as in 

 form and in the pubescence of the abdomen they agree with the present species, 

 it would be proper to place them under it.

New York, Georgia, Nebraska, Texas. Fabricius describes it from South 

 America, and the identity of his species with ours is therefore doubtful. The 

 legs vary in color; sometimes they are piceous with yellow margins ; sometimes 

 they are yellow with only the base of the thighs blackish. The prosternum is 

 sometimes yellow and sometimes black. The abdomen is entirely pubescent, and 

 usually appears black ; sometimes a range of small yellow spots is seen each 

 side near the margin.

California, at San Diego and the Colorado. Differs from the preceding by it3 

 more regularly elliptical form, acd by the broader yellow margin; that of the 

 elytra is wider at the base, and there appears triple ; at the mi' die it becomes 

 narrower, and immediately before the apex is frequently dilated by the addition 

 of several small linear spots. The prosternum is yellow, and the base of the 

 thighs black ; the abdomen each side is marked with an indistinct series of yel- 

 low spots. 



Varieties occur in which the sides of the elytra have three or four additional 

 indistinct yellow lines running from the broader anterior portion of the yellow 

 margin to the iip.

Hydrocharis Latr. 



Although Erichson has placed this genus, which corresponds to Hydrophilus 

 Leach, and Hydrous Bridle, Mulsant, as a section of the preceding, it appears to 

 me that the greater size of the prosternum, aad the absence of the metasternal 

 spine ought to be con&idered with the differences in the mandibles as of generic 

 value. With regard to the name to be applied to the genus, if admitted, there 

 is more difficulty. Yet, as the name Hydrophilus, as established by Geoffroy, 

 plainly belongs to the previous genus, and as Leach, in his anxiety to preserve 

 traditions even when superseded by actual publication, applied the name Hy- 

 drous! Linn, to the previous genus, it is obvious that Mr. Brulle acted at least 

 imprudently, in taking the name last mentioned for a genus so closely allied to 

 the original Hydrous, as the one now under consideration. 



It appears, however, from Agassiz' Xomenclator Zoologicus, that the name 

 here ad pled was proposed by Latreille in -1825, (Fam. Nat.), while Mr. 

 Brulle appears to have limited the name Hydrous to this genus in 1834, the date 

 of his "Histoire Nat. des Insectes," and thus to have been anticipated by La- 

 treille.

Philhydrus Solier. 



This genus is not adopted by Ericbson, who considers it as merely a section of 

 Hydrobius : the very great differrnce however in the length and structure of the 

 maxillary palpi, as well as the general appearance of the insects, induce me to 

 believe tbat the separation is natural. 



It is otherwise with the genus Helochares (formerly Helophilus) of Mr. Mulsant : 

 it was separated from Philhydrus by the mesosternum being only very slightly 

 caiinate, and not furnished with the anterior compressed lamina seen in most 

 species. Yet in examining the species of both Hydrobius and Philhydrus, I find 

 such want of uniformity in the sternum, as to convince me tbat characters drawn 

 from tbat portion of the body must be regarded as specific, or at most sectional 

 in their value. On. these principles the native species may be thus arranged.

 are testaceous, the pale border of the elytra is fimbriated posteriorly : the abdomen 

 is yellowish, with the middle brownish, and the feet are almost entirelv yellowish. 

 Color, however, is so variable in this genus, that it cannot be taken as character- 

 istic, and recourse must be had to form and sculpture, which are sufficiently 

 distinct, in all the species herein noted, to render their recognition a matter of 

 very small difficulty.

 in front of the middle coxae. 



In answer to some questions regarding the difference between P. cinctus and 

 limbialis Dr. Melsheimer writes as follows : " the latter is larger, more oval and 

 less convex than the first ; the colored margins are aLo broader and all ill- other 

 characters more distinct, but notwithstanding these differences, i now consider 

 them as different sexes." Say in his description does not mendon the sutural 

 stria, but I learn from Dr. Melsheimer that it is quite distinct.

372 [June, 



Middle and Southern States : the four internal striae of the elytra are gradually 

 shorter anteriorly: the sutural one is bifid by the confluence of a small scutellar 

 stria, but with the second is almost entirely obliterated on the anterior fifth of 

 the elytra. The anterior dilated plate of the mesosternum is not quadrilateral 

 as in the preceding, but triangular and acute as in Hydrobius, to some species of 

 which it bears considerable resemblance, but may be distinguished by the long 

 slender palpi. 



In Fauna Bor. Am. (p. 120) Mr. Kirby cites the European P. marginellus and 

 melanocephalus as occurring in North America : the descriptions however are 

 not sufficiently characteristic to enable them to be referred with certainty to any 

 of the species above described to whice they may belong.

of the elytra are placed upon the striae, and not scattered on the interstices as

The European H. fuscipes is said by Kirby (Fauna Bor. Am. 119) and by 

 Mannerheim (Bull. Mosc. 1853) to be found in the northern part of the conti- 

 nent. The descriptions will apply equally well to the three striate species above 

 described, yet, on comparison with European specimens, they all seem to me to 

 be sufficiently distinct. H. insculptus approaches them most nearly, but the 

 thorax is not so short and is narrowed more obliquely towards the tip.

Middle States, Nebraska, Lake Superior, and Colorado River, California; com- 

 mon. Although in general appearance and sculpture this species resembles 

 Hydrobius, the antenae have but 8 joints, and are formed as in Laccobiu3 agilis. 

 The posterior tarsi appear to possess an indistinct row of ciliae on their upper 

 margin but are comparatively shorter and more slender. The middle and pos- 

 terior tibiae are furnished with some irregularly scattered spiDes. It is at first 

 doubtful whether this species should be joined with Laccobius, or with Hydro- 

 bius (from which it seems to differ only by the number of joints in the antennae), 

 or whether a separate genus should be established for its reception. From Lac- 

 cobius however, it differs in the sculpture of the ventral segments of the abdo- 

 men, and the form of the posterior trochanter, while in these characters it 

 agrees entirely with Hydrobius. 



In the smaller specimens the punctures of the elytra are sometimes less dis- 

 tinct towards the base. Specimens also occur in which the lateral margin of 

 the thorax and the tips of the elytra are yellowish.

 nearly one-half the length of the entire antenna: Erichson has erroneously de- 

 scribed (Kafer Mark. 213) it as being short, but the description given by Mul- 

 sant, (Coleopt. de France, Palpicornes, 148) is correct. The striae of the elytra 

 are very faint, and merely formed by rows of punctures which are scarcely 

 larger than the fine punctures which cover the whole upper surface, and they 

 vanish entirely towards the base of the elytra. The prosternum, though pointed 

 posteriorly, reaches almost to the mesosternum : the carina is more prominent 

 anteriorly.

Cercyon Leach. 



On account of the difference in form of the pro- and mesosternum, Mr. Mul- 

 sant has separated from this genus three which he names Pelosoma, Megaster- 

 num (properly Megalosternum) and Cryptopleurum. Erichson has expressed 

 as his opinion that the characters upon which they were separated are insuffi- 

 cient, while Lacordaire, in the second volume of his most excellent work on 

 Genera of Coleoptera, has recombined Pelosoma with Cercyon, but leaves Me- 

 gasternum and Cryptopleurum distinct. 



Having found in America representatives of all these groups, I am inclined to 

 agree with the views expressed by Lacordaire. 



My series of the common species of Cercyon is not sufficiently large to enable 

 me to investigate the genus in a satisfactory manner ; I will therefore postpone 

 the description of new species, and the synonymy of those previously described ; 

 merely making known two species which are remarkable and easily recognized. 



I may add as a contribution to future synonymy, that C. mundum Mels. is 

 C. centrimaculatum, and that C. maculatum Mels. is C. a n a 1 e , both 

 European species mentioned by Erichson (Kafer Mark Brand.) as found in 

 America. C. fimbriatum Maniih. described from Sitka, was found by me in 

 California.

 of punctures of the elytra can hardly be seen, but near the margin and behind 

 the middle are more or less faint traces of striae. The mesosternum is not 

 wider than long, and the anterior angle is quite sharp. This species belongs to 

 Pelosoma Muls.

One specimen found in York county, Pennsylvania, was given me by Dr. 

 Melsh^imer. The palpi are precisely as in Cercyon ; the sternum exactly 

 like the figure given by Mulsant of M. boletophagum : the naked deflexed py- 

 gidium is an anomaly which 1 have not seen in any species of this family, and 

 with the pectdiar sculpture seems to indicate an approach to Histeroid genera 

 like Ontbophilus. Other specimens, when procured, will enable a more full 

 examination to be made, and will perhaps render necessary the establishment 

 of a new jienus. The anterior tibiae (as far as I can examine them) do not 

 appear to be emarginate, as in M. boletophagum. The elevated lines of the 

 thorax are quite indistinct, except the one nearest the margin, which is entire 

 and quite obvious. 



An allied but much smaller species, without elevated lines on the thorax and 




1855.] 375 



with the furrows of the elytra less deep and less crenate was found by me 

 at Panama: in the only specimen left, the pygidium is entirely covered by 

 the elytra, as in other Cercyons.

 large triangular plates at the bases of the arms ; the sides with scattered, mi- 

 nute spines; the interbrachial plates below subrhombic ia shape. Arms in 

 length seven times the diameter of the disk, broad near their origins but very 

 slender at their extremities ; lateral spines six in each row, the upper ones being 

 largest, subclavate, with rounded extremities, compressed and distantly serrated. 



PROCEED. ACAD. NAT. SCI. OF PHILADELPHIA. VOL. VII. NO. X. 30 




386 [July, 



The spines near the extremities of the arms are, however, generally pointed. 

 Disk reddish, with black spots symmetrically arranged ; arms red, broadly annu- 

 late with black; spines pale brownish. Diameter, 4 inches. Found among 

 soft sponges in the circumlittoral zone. 

 Hab. Australia, at Port Jackson. 



2. Ophiothrix planulata. Disk and arms much depressed ; the latter in 

 length ten times the width of the former. Disk small, smooth and glossy above ; 

 arm-plates broadly triangular, separated from each other by a row of the small 

 plates with which the rest of the disk is covered. Below, the sides of the disk, 

 between the arms, are soft and covered with short spines ; the interbrachial 

 plates subrhombic, but not very distinct. The mouth-fissures have each two 

 large suckers, but no papillae on their sides. Arms suddenly tapering at the 

 middle ; their superior plates trapezoidal and minutely granulated ; lateral 

 spines five in each row, the middle ones largest, compressed, with blunt extremi- 

 ties, longitudinally striated, and denticulated on their edges. Disk dark green- 

 ish ; arms colored with red and light brown alternately : below white. Taken 

 in fifteen fathoms among dead corals, on " Groper Shoal," in S. Lat., 20 E. Lon. 



3. Ophiolepis perplexfs. Arms filiform, in length about seventeen times the 

 diameter of the disk. Dorsal surface of the disk covered with small scales, the 

 arm-plates of each pair being elongated, very narrow, broadest exteriorly, and 

 including a triangular space between them ; ventral surface with the inter- 

 brachial plates broader than long ; mouth with a pair of large scale-like papillae 

 at the summit of each projecting angle, and a pair at the base of each fissure. 

 Lateral spines of the arms five in number in each row, short, thick, and pointed. 

 Disk above dark greyish ; arms purplish-brown, darker and lighter alternately ; 

 below reddish. The disk is very soft and is always cast by the animal when 

 caught; the slender arms then twisting together in all directions. Found in the 

 circumlittoral zone in mud.

 erg small, uniformly distributed over the whole surface. Anus with five cal- 

 careous papillce. Tentacula much branched, ten in number, two of which are 

 much smaller than the rest. The oral column is the most remarkable feature in 

 this species, it being about one-half as long as the body, and consisting of a 

 flexible calcareous cylinder, contorted below, and sending ten short spurs of 

 points upward, and five pairs of long twisted ones downward. Its flexibility is 

 owing to the circumstance that its calcareous matter is deposited in the form of 

 irregular plates connected by softer parts. The inferior spurs thus seem jointed.

 extremity and slightly bent at the other. The larger kind are scattered, quite 

 thickly, along one side of the body only ; and are prominent, circular, white, 

 calcareous, varying in size from l-40th to l-20th of an inch in diameter ; they 

 are composed of accumulations of minute, sis-spoked wheels. The tentacula 

 are ten in number, each having ten serrulated digitations, placed on the outer 

 and the lateral margins of a sort of disk, which forms the anterior half of the 

 inner side of the tentacle. Color, pale yellowish. Length, 2 inches; breadth, 

 0.2 inch. Found under stones, near low-water mark.

 lor ; skin very thickly provided with hook-bearing plates, which have usually 




1855.] 387 



about ten perforations, the middle ones largest. The hamulae are a little larger 

 than the plates, pickaxe-shaped, with the extremity of the handle also provided 

 with a double hook, though of very small size. Tentacula twelve, digitate 

 nearly to their bases ; digitations short, about fourteen in number to each ten- 

 tacle. Length 2 inches. Found under stones, near low-water mark.

 siderable length, when they are smooth and cylindrical. Posterior tentacles 

 dark green, slender, and very numerous, in two clusters. Superior setae capil- 

 lary, as long as the inferior ones, and eight in number in each of the compressed 

 fascicles which contain them. Inferior pinnae containing each a single long 

 stout hooked seta. Length, 1.5 inch. Found loosely attached under atones 

 near low-water mark.

 rected forward ; those of the first in four fan-like clusters, arranged so as to 

 form a circle around the mouth ; those of the second segment much fewer in 

 number, and placed on the sides of the body only; those of the third rot con- 

 spicuous. Anterior tentacles long, diverging ; posterior ones shorter, slender,

 sal pinnas are united to form sacs, of which those of the 14th and 15th are much 

 the smallest, and compressed above ; the ventral shields of these two rings are 

 compressed, bilobate, and protruded so as to lose the disc-like form. Dorsal 

 pinnas of the 16th and succeeding rings large and finger-shaped, with capillary 

 setae ; posteriorly they grow more slender but not much shorter. In these

Indications of Twelve Species of Fossil Fishes. 

 By Joseph Leidy, M. D. 



1. Myliobates serratus. Based upon a specimen consisting of four median 

 dental plates, with parts of two others and the first row on each side of lateral 

 dental plates. The triturating surface of the specimen is quite level, except that 

 it is slightly depressed along the median line, and slopes off in a concave manner. 

 The median dental plates are united by sutures slightly convex forward, and 

 distinctly serrated at their outer part. The first row of lateral dental plates are 

 nearly hexagons, and they are connected with each other and with the median 

 plates by distinctly serrated suture. 



The attaching surface of the specimens forms two planes inclining to a median, 

 convex angle. 



Breadth of median plates 10 J lines, width antero-posteriorly If lines. 



Locality. Discovered by Dr. C. H. Budd, in the Green Sand of Burlington Co., 

 New Jersey. 



Remarks. The specimen closely resembles a corresponding one characterized 

 by Agassiz, as Myliobates suturalis. 



2. Myliobates rugosus. Based upon a specimen, consisting of four median 

 dental plates, indicating a large species of the genus, though not so large as the 

 Myliobates Holmesii, Gibbes, which, however, appears rather to be an Aetobatis, 

 judging from Dr. Gibbes' figures,* of the same type as the A. eximius. The two 

 latter might be considered as the representatives of a new genus, in which there 

 exists a median row of dental plates, and a single row laterally of small tri- 

 lateral plates. It would be intermediate to Aetob-itis and the true Myliobates, and 

 might be called Mesobatis. The triturating surface of the specimen of Myliobates 



* Journ. Acad. Nat. Sc. 2d s. i. pi. 42, fig. 1. 




396 [August, 



rugosus is prominently convex and longitudinally wrinkled, especially at the ex- 

 tremities of the median dental plates. The latter are united by convex suture 

 directed forward. The attaching surface of the specimen is flat. 



Diameter of the median plates transversely 2 inches and 4 lines, antero-pos- 

 teriorly 4^ to b} lines. 



Locali'g. Discovered by Mr. Horner in the Marl of New Egypt, New Jersey. 

 T. A. Conrad. 



3. Myliobates obesus. Based upon a pair of median dental plates of a species 

 smaller than M. rugosus, and comparatively more convex in its sutures and its 

 triturating surface. 



The estimated transverse diameter of the median plates was about 16 lines, 

 the antero-posterior diameter is 3^ lines. 



Locality. Discovered by Dr. Charles H. Budd, in the Green sand of Burlington 

 Co., New Jersey. 



4. Zygobates ddbids. Based upon numerous specimens of isolated dental 

 plates. The median dental plates are comparatively wide compared with their 

 transverse breadth, their triturating surface is convex, and the attaching surface 

 concave and parallel with the former. The lateral dental plates of the first row 

 present a corresponding width and breadth to the median plates. Their tritu- 

 rating surface is convex and slopes off laterally, and their attaching surface is 

 straight. 



Transverse diameter of median plates 6 to 16 lines, antero-posterior 2 to 4J 

 lines, thickness 1|- to 3 lines. Transverse diameter of lateral plates of the first 

 row up to 13 lines, antero-posterior up to 4 lines. 



Locality. Discovered by Capt. Bowman, U. S. A., in the sands of Ashley 

 river, South Carolina. Probably washed from eocene beds. 



5. Aetobatis perspicuds. Based upon a specimen consisting of one half of 

 an isolated dental plate of the upper jaw. Although the fragment is a very small 

 one, it is very characteristic. The triturating surface is smooth, excepting, how- 

 ever, the accidental scratches ; and it is perfectly level antero-posteriorly, and 

 is slightly convex transversely ; and the attaching surface is parallel with the 

 former. The anterior and posterior margins form the segment of a circle bent 

 at a very obtuse angle. The outer extremity of the dental plate is abruptly 

 truncated, and the enamel turns down laterally to the extent of a line. The 

 antero-external angle forms a projecting heel, and the corresponding posterior 

 angle presents a concave fossa for the reception of the contiguous heel of the 

 posterior dental plate. 



Estimated breadth of the upper dental series 21 inches, antero-posterior width 

 cf the dental plate at its middle 4 lines, thickness 4 lines. 



Locality. Discovered by Dr. J. L. Burtt in the Green Sand of New Jersey. 



6. Aetobatis bximius. Based upon a specimen consisting of one half of four 

 median dental plates, with a corresponding row of lateral plates. The median 

 plates are perfectly level on the triturating surface, except at their outer ex- 

 tremity, where they are abruptly rounded off. The sutures are slightly bow 

 formed, and of the two sides of the outer extremities that anterior is the longest. 

 The species has but a single row of lateral plates, which are convex at their 

 outer border, and are angular within to join two contiguous median plates. 



Estimated transverse diameter of the dental series, including the small lateral 

 plates 23 lines, antero-posterior diameter of the median plates Z\ lines. 



Locality. Discovered by Capt. Bowman, U. S. A., in the sands of Ashley 

 river, S. C. Probably washed from Eocene beds. 



7. Odax carolinensis. Based upon numerous specimens, consisting of por- 

 tions of the jaws and pharyngeal bones, with teeth. External extremities of the 

 maxillary denticles very distinct from one another, convex, six in number in a 

 vertical row of 5- lines. Pharyngeal bones triangular, with two short equal 

 sides, and the long side measuring from 6 to 8 lines, densely furnished with teeth 

 resembling in form the corresponding ones of Pogomas.

Locality. Discovered by Capt. Bowman, U. S. A., in the sands of Ashley 

 river, South Carolina. 



8. Pogonias. Numerous isolated teeth of this genus, of the same form and 

 size as those of the recent Pogonias chromis, were discovered by Capt. Bowman 

 with the preceding in the sands of Ashley river. 



9. Sphyr^na major. Based upon numerous specimens (more than a hundred) 

 of isolated crowns of teeth, the smallest of which measures 3 | lines long and 2.] 

 lines wide at the base, and the longest 8h lines long by 4| lines wide at the base. 



Locality. Discovered by Capt. Bowman in the sands of Ashley river, South 

 Carolina. 



16. Enchodus ferox. Sphy/csna, Morton : Syn. Org. Rem. Cret. Group of the 

 U. S., PI. xii. fig. i. Based upon specimens in the Cabinet of the Academy, 

 consisting of fragments of the jaws with teeth, which have usually been referred 

 to the genus Sphyrcena, but to this they do not belong, as the teeth are not in- 

 serted in sockets, but are implanted by expanding roots co-ossified with the 

 surface of the jaws, 'lhe specimens consist of an isolated anterior tooth (repre- 

 sented in Morton's PI. xii. fig. 1), of a portion of the left intermaxillary bone with 

 the anterior tooth, which measures If inches in length from its base of attachment: 

 a fragment of the right intermaxillary bone, with the roots of two large leeto. 

 and a row of small, uncompressed, conical teeth at the outer margiu ; and a 

 fragment of a palatal bone, with one large conical tooth having trenchant borders. 

 and the roots of two other teeth. 



Locality. Discovered in the Green Sand near Mount Holly, New Jersey. The 

 teeth of this species are relatively narrower compared with their length, than in 

 Enchodus Favjasii, Ag., from the Mtestricht beds. 



11. Xiphias astiquus. Based upon a specimen consisting of ten and a half 

 inches of the extremity of the prolonged maxillary bones. 



The posterior broken extremity of the specimen is transversely oval in section, 

 and measures 2 inches in its long diameter and 1 inch in it3 short diameter. 

 Anteriorly the specimen becomes more cylindrical, and at the anterior broken 

 end it measures 5 lines in diameter. 



Locality. Discovered by Dr. Chas. H. Buc'd, in the Green Sand of Burlingto.i 

 Co., New Jersey. 



12. Diodon vetus. Based upon numerous specimens consisting of water- 

 rolled jaws with the alveolar and oral teeth. 



The internal or oral teeth consist of a conjoined pair of piles, of from 6 to 10 

 trilateral laminae, measuring from 3}- to 4J lines wide. The outer or alveolar 

 teeth are composed of small lamellar denticles, of which the margin of 4 or 5 

 may be counted anteriorly in the space of a line. 



Locality. Discovered by Capt. Bowman, U. S. A , in the sands of Ashley river, 

 S. C.

Descriptions of new species of Astacus from Georgia. 



By John Le Conte. 



A few years ago there were but three or four species of this genus known to 

 inhabit the United States ; lately Mr. Girard, in the proceedings of this Society 

 vol. vi. page 86. has increased the number to eighteen or nineteen ; but one 

 however is from the South, A. Blandingii. I now add to this number eight more : 

 two of them from the upper part of the State of Georgia, the rest from the low 

 country. There are two more species which I have seen, but have not been able 

 to obtain. What number of species are found in the rivers of the South is not 

 yet ascertained. All those which I have seen were inhabitants of ditches, ponds 

 and rivulets of clear water, or formed burrows in the mud of wet ground. Their 

 extreme similarity renders it difficult to distinguish the species from each other, 

 and this difficulty will undoubtedly increase as the number of species is multi- 

 plied. To what extent this number may reach cannot be guessed at ; it appears 

 however that when these animals come to be more closely studied, this number 

 will be very great, and the passage of one species into another become almost 

 imperceptible; so that among Crustaceans we shall have an analogous difficulty 

 to that which exists among Uniones. Their color is generally lost with their 

 life, so that it is of little value in the description. All that I have ever seen 

 were much of the same color, a reddish-brown, inclining to a dark olive. The 

 shape of the rostrum and of the chelae and the size of the Areola vertebralis, afford 

 the best characteristic marks. I have never known this last character to vary in 

 any degree. In the two others there may occur slight differences of develope- 

 ment, not however so great as to be of any moment. I do not find that any 

 marks can be definitely pointed out, by which we can distinguish those which 

 are subterranean from those which are aquatic.

In all the species of this genus which have come under my observation, I have 

 observed that the following characters are found. The lamina antennalis is 

 dolabriform, inwardly fringed, outwardly thickened, straight and ending in a 

 small spine. The dorsum is smooth with transverse rows of punctures. The 

 carpus has a deep longitudinal impression. The males also have on the second 

 and third of the small legs a tooth directed inwards, in some species only on the 

 second. 



In drawing up these descriptions it will be observed that I have preserved the 

 old name of Astacus in preference to the new appellation of Cambarus. The 

 very slight and not very apparent differences which have been adopted to dis- 

 tinguish these two genera appear to me of little moment. 



On a new species of Gelasimus. 



By John Le Conte. 



One species only of Gelasimus ha9 long been known as an inhabitant of our 

 salt marshes. I now offer to the Society, the description of a second species, 

 found on the sea coast of New Jersey. It seems hitherto to have escaped the no- 




1855.] 403 



tice of naturalists. Last summer our associate Mr. Ashmead brought some 

 from Beesley's Point, N. J., and I cannot find any description agreeing with it. All 

 the other species in the books except one, appear to have been brought from 

 tropical countries. I have added a detailed description of the G. pugilator or 

 common species which is said to be found along our whole line of coast, in order 

 that a comparison may be made between the two. This I have of course placed 

 first. 



Gelasimus pugilator, Bgsc. Carapace smooth, shining, in front sinuous and 

 three-lobed, the middle lobe tbe largest, bent down, the lateral lobes but slightly 

 prominent likewise bent down ; margined, the lateral margins ciliate; anterior 

 exterior angles right. Back impressed as it were with the letter H, a small de- 

 pressed spot generally paler colored about one fourth of the distance from the 

 outer edge of the fore part on each side. Lower eye-lid finely serrate, cheeks 

 and feet except the chelae hairy. Tail strongly ciliate. Tarsi sharp, slightly 

 curved. Color dark brownish olive, all the feet lighter colored, chelae nearly 

 white. 



Male. With either the right or left chela very large, inflated, margined, the 

 inner margin of the palm bifurcate near the extremity. Palm and carpus granu- 

 late ; brachium with short irregular rows of granules, the immoveable finger 

 straight deeply grooved from the point to near the centre, with a triple row of 

 small teeth, and one large one near the middle, the moveable finger curved, 

 toothed like the moveable one, with sometimes three larger teeth, and slightly 

 costate : small chela smooth the fingers nearly straight. 



Length -65; breadth anteriorly 1 iuch, posteriorly '4. Large chela 1*7, 

 small 4. 



This species which is found on the salt marshes and the edges of creeks of the 

 sea shore in innumerable quantities, was first described by Bosc in his Histoire 

 Naturelle des Crustacee3, vol. vi. page 96, and afterwards by Say, in the Jour- 

 nal of our Society vol. i. page 71. From its being so common and so well 

 known I omit saying anything on its manners. It was formerly considered 

 the same as the G. vocans of Brazil or Amboyna. Whether it is so or not, 

 remains yet to be determined, the descriptions of the South American or Indian 

 animal which are to be found in the books being so impeifect, that it is impos- 

 sible to decide the question. 



G. 3iim\x. Carapace very finely granulate with a number of small tuber- 

 cles near the anterior exterior angles, front as in the former species only the 

 lateral lobes are much wider and more bent down ; margined, the margin very 

 finely serrate and ciliate on the sides : anterior exterior angle rounded. Back 

 impressed with the letter H, with an oblique stria running from the lateral lobe 

 of the front of the carapace on each side to the upright arms of the impressed 

 letter. Both the eye-lids are bluntly serrate. Cheeks and feet as in G. pugi- 

 lator, except the latter are paler colored, as is the tail likewise. 



Male'. With the right or left chela very large, inflated, outwardly scarcely 

 margined, inwardly margined as in the former species, but the bifurcation com- 

 mences lower down. Palm and carpus covered with tubercles, those on the in- 

 terior edge of the latter forming a kind of crest. Immoveable finger straight 

 with a double row of blunt teeth, which near the point are separated by an ex- 

 cavation for the reception of the point of the moveable finger, the middle is fur- 

 nished with a single larger tooth. The moveable finger is very much curved 

 with a triple row of blunt teeth, three of which behind the middle and two be- 

 fore it are larger; at each of the joints there are one or two red spots, brachium 

 with short irregular rows of small tubercles: tail ciliate speckled with black ; 

 small chela, and feet like those of G. pugilator. 



Female chelae like the small one of the male. 



Length 1 inch ; breadth anteriorly 1-5; posteriorly -65. Large chela 2 8 ; 

 small, -6.

Remarks on two Species of American Cimex. 

 By John Le Conte. 



Reddvius pungens. Black, shining, wings opaque. Head a little hairy, antennae 

 yellowish brown, slightly hairy, first joint shorter than the head, second, fourth 

 and fifth much longer, subequal, third very small. Thorax slightly margined, 

 strongly constricted in the middle, the anterior portion rounded and longitudi- 

 nally sulcate, the posterior portion transverse. First pair of legs hairy on the 

 under side, as are the thighs also of the second pair, but the tibiae and tarsi of 

 the hinder legs all over. 



Length .8 of an inch. Inhabits Georgia. 



This species is remarkable for the intense pain caused by its bite. I do not 

 know whether it ever willingly plunges its rostrum into any person ; but when, 

 caught or unskilfully handled, it always stings. In this case the pain is almost 

 equal to that of the bite of a snake, and the swelling and irritation which result 

 from it will sometimes last for a week. In very weak and irritable constitutions 

 it may even prove fatal. 



This R pungens too nearly resembles the R. personatus of Europe to be 

 authoritatively pronounced different. As however I can find no very detailed 

 description of the European animal, and as it is difficult to suppose that it 

 would be imported from its native country, and yet be found in the Southern 

 States, I have concluded to give it provisionally the name v< hich it bears at 

 the head of this article. Its food consists of flies and other soft insects, which 

 it catches very adroitly and soon deprives of all their juices. 



Conorhinus sanguisuga. Black, head and thorax granulate, neck rather long 

 projecting. Antennae slender, first joint much shorter than the head, second, 

 fourth and fifth subequal about the length of the head, tip of the rostrum 

 brown. Thorax triangular, with a tubercle in front on each side, slightly con- 

 stricted before the middle, in front with two raised lines diverging backwards, 

 and most raised in front, margined with red ; scutellura with two raised diverging 

 lines directed forwards and joined at the base. Wings granulate at the base, 

 with two triangular red spots on each, one at the base, the other near the middle 

 on the outside. Abdomen with six red spots on each side, both above and be- 

 neath. 



Length 1 inch. Inhabits Georgia. 



This insect, equally with the former, inflicts a most painful wound. It is re- 

 markable also for sucking the blood of mammals, particularly of children. I 

 have known its bite followed by very serious consequences, the patient not re- 

 covering from its effects for nearly a year. 



The many relations which we have of spider bites frequently proving fatal, 

 have no doubt arisen from the stings of these insects or others of the same genera. 

 When the disease called spider bite is not an anthrax or carbuncle, iUis un- 

 doubtedly occasioned by the bite of an insect, by no means however of a spider. 

 Among the many species of Araneidaa which we have in the United States, I 

 have never seen one capable of inflicting the slightest wound. Ignorant persons 

 may easily mistake a Cimex for a spider. I have known a physician who sent 

 to me the fragments of a large ant, which he supposed was a spider, that came 

 out of his grandchild's head.

On artificially formed Skulls from the Ancient World. 



By Prof. A. Retzius, (Stockholm, Sweden). 

 [Communicated by Prof. Charles D. Meigs.] 



Several years ago the eminent anatomist, Professor Joseph Hyrtl, of Vienna, 

 had the kindness to send me a cast of an artificially formed skull of great interest. 

 The original, found at Grafenegg, in Austria, has, by its owner, Count August 

 von Brauner, been considered as having belonged to an individual of the Avari- 

 an Huns, who lived in the neighborhood from the end of the seventh to the be- 

 ginning of the eighth century. Of this skull I have given in 1844 a description 

 in the Proceedings of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Stockholm, which was 

 :he following year inserted both in HornschucKs Archiv Skandinavischer Bei- 

 trilge zur Naturgeschichte, and in Muller's Archiv fur Physiologic I showed 

 there that this skull, which had been considered remarkable for its length, 

 certainly was extremely high, but on the contrary short, or of the brachiocephalic 

 form, to which the skulls of the Avarians, as related with those of the Finlanders, 

 must belong. This opinion gained at the time very little approbation, because 

 Dr. Tschudi, renowned for his travels and researches in South America, shortly 

 after with so much certainty declared that the skull in question was of Peruvian 

 origin, and supposed that it had been brought over from Peru to Austria with 

 other collections. Tschudi's opinion gained many adherents, and the question 

 about the custom in the ancient world of forming the head artificially sank for 

 some time in oblivion. Through a very excellent treatise by Doctor Fiizinger, 

 in the Transactions of the Imperial Academy in Vienna, it has been shown that 

 the skull found at Grafenegg must undoubtedly have belonged to an individual 

 of the ancient inhabitants of the country. He has not only wholly explained al) 

 important circumstances concerning this skull, but has also got a quite similar 

 one from Atzgerrsdorf, in south Austria 1\ mile from Vienna. This had been 

 dug out of the earth in presence of the physician of the place, Milller. This skull, 

 as well as the original of the one first mentioned, are now at the Imperial anato- 

 mical museum at Vienna. The author shows the resemblance between these 

 skulls and tho=e which have been found at Krim and described by Messrs. Rathe 

 and Charles Meyer. He mentions the account of Hippocrates (de aere aquis et 

 locis Lib. 1,) about the macrocephali or Scythians in the neighborhood of the 

 Moetian moor, who had artificially formed skulls. Further he quotes Pcmponius 

 Mela (de situ orbis Lib. 1. chap. 19), who says that the custom of changing the 

 form of the head reigned also among the inhabitants of the Bosphorus ; Pliny 

 the older, who accounts for the macrocephali in the neighborhood of Ceresus in Na- 

 tolia on the coast of the Black Sea, the Keresum of the present day ; also Sup h anus 

 Byzantinus (Geographica,) who tells us of macrocephalic Scythians among the 

 inhabitants of Colchis, now Mingrelia, on the east coast of the Black Sea. He 

 quotes from Strabo (Lib. II, Chap. 16), the Derbikks on the Caucasus, towards 

 the Caspian sea, and the Sigyns, Median colonists, who are said to have lived in 

 the valley of the Danube at the river Taler, as nations who have used to change 

 the form of the head, so that the forehead was thus put forward. Doctor Fitz- 

 inger mentions also another circumstance of importance in connexion with the 

 description of these skulls, namely, a medal of unknown origin, representing the 

 destruction of the town of Aquileja by Aitila, with Attilas head in profile, with 

 the same form as the skulls of Avarians before mentioned. The same medal in 

 gold is preserved in the royal medal cabinet at Stockholm, where the Rep. ha3 

 had the opportunity to see it, and to agree with Dr. Fiizinger. Beside these 

 important informations respecting the singularly formed heads of the Avarians, 

 this excellent treatise contains al o a close examination of the human skulls 

 found in the forest of Vienna in the Calvarian mountain, which were described in 

 1830 by Count Rasumowsky in Oken's Isis, as having an extraordinary form, 

 and which the Rep. in his former treatise did unjustly believe to be of the 

 same form as the Avarian skulls. Dr. Fiizinger has examined these heads and 

 has found that they are of the Slavic form. This learned treatise is furnished 




406 



[September, 



with four extremely good illustrations, two of which represent skulls of Avarians 

 and the other Slavic ones from the mount of Calvaria. A perfect harmony with 

 the before mentioned skulls of Avarians is shown in a head found in Switzerland, 

 of which M. Troyon has sent drawings to the Rep.; copies of them are here repre- 

 sented reduced to a quarter's size. 



The original is preserved in M. Troy oris archeologic collections at Bel-air in 

 the Canton Vaud near Lausanne. The skull was found at the bottom of a tomb 

 of very high age, no ornaments or tools were in the neighborhood. Of more 

 than 200 tombs which have been examined by M. Troyon, this was the only 

 one of that kind. 



M. Troyon has on the same occasion given 

 several informations concerning discoveries 

 of other skulls of the same singular form at 

 the village St. Romain in Savoy, in similar 

 tombs, likewise without ornaments and tools. 

 These skulls were so fragile that they fell in 

 pieces shortly after they had been dug out of 

 theearth. Nevertheless, Dr. Gosse, at Geneva, 

 has succeeded in preserving the upper part 

 of one. The Rep. has through the kindness 

 of Mr. Troyon got the opportunity here to 

 show a drawing in quarter size. 



There is no doubt that these skulls have 

 belonged to the same nations as the above 




1855.] 407 



mentioned skulls from Austria that is, from Avarians, who probably accom- 

 panied Attila's army. In connexion with this it deserves also to be mentioned, 

 that Professor Duvernoy at Paris has sent to the Rep. a drawing and description 

 of a high brachycephalic skull of very remote age, which was found in 1849, not 

 far from the surface of the earth during the digging of a road in the valley of the 

 Doubs, not far from Mandeuse. Professor Duvernoy is himself of the opinion 

 that it must have belonged to one of Attila's warriors, because in this neighbor- 

 hood the ruins of an old Roman town destroyed by Attilais situated. It has ex- 

 actly the form of a Finlandian skull not pressed. What a consternation did the 

 deformed skulls of Huanches Indians, which Pentland brought from Titicaca in 

 Peru, not excite? What a surprise to see the various skulls which were so 

 changed in form, and were first made known by Morton's work, Crania Ameri- 

 cana ! This absurd and barbarous custom was considered to belong only to the 

 savage heathens of America. Through the skull found at Grafenegg, attention 

 has been turned to the question, how far this same barbarous custom has reigned 

 also in the ancient world ; more and more evidences affirming this opinion have 

 been found. As is above seen, we have had the proofs of this fact in the ancient 

 authors from the old and middle ages, without taking notice of them. To the 

 important dates quoted by Dr. Fitzinger and M. Troy on, the Rep. takes the op- 

 portunity to add some more. In the excellent historical work byAmedee Thierry, 

 Altilij of which the Rep. only knows Dr. Edward Burckhardt's translation,' (Attila 

 Schilderungen aus der Geschichte des fiinften Jahrhunderts, Leipzig, 1852,) is 

 mentioned, where the author has shown, that the proper Huns were Finlanders 

 from the Ural and the valley of the Wolga, but that with them were under the 

 same government, Turks, and probably Mongols, beside later Slaves, etc., and that 

 Attila himself, and part of his people have been delineated as belonging to the 

 Kalmuck type. In a note, page 15, about the custom of changing the form of 

 the head, he has the following : " The image of Attila is more like that of a 

 Mongol than of a Finlander from the Ural. Besides we know that the Huns 

 useJ artificial means for giving Mongolian physiognomy to their children ; they 

 made, namely, the nose flat, with firmly strained linen ribbons, and pressed the 

 head to make the cheek bones projecting. What could be the reasonable cause 

 of this barbarous custom, if not the effort to approach a form, which, among the 

 Huns, was held in greater regard, in a word, the aristocratic race ? The purpose 

 quoted by the Roman authors, to get the helmet better fixed on the head, is 

 scarcely credible. It seems more probable, that when the Mongols were masters 

 of the Huns, the Mongolian physiognomy was the prize attached to aristocratic 

 distinctions ; they consequently tried to approach this form, and considered it an 

 honor thus to deform themselves, in order to resemble the reigning nation. This 

 is most likely the cause of those unnatural deformations which historical writers 

 so particularly describe." This opinion agrees fully with that which the Rep. 

 has supposed in his treatise " Phrenology judged from an anatomical point of view," 

 and also with Prof. Eschricht " Angaaende Betydningen of Hjerneskallens og hele 

 Hovedeis Formforskjellighed (Skand. Naturf. SaJlsk. Forhandl.") respecting the same 

 custom among the American savages. Thus we see more and more traces show- 

 ing that this absurd custom formerly has been considerably common in the 

 ancient world, and, after the authority of Thierry, we may suppose, that it 

 principally and perhaps originally belonged to the Mongols, among whom the- 

 Rep. believes it hasnow^ceased. Many who are interested in the study of skulls 

 will s irely be greatly astonished to hear, that this barbarous custom still exists 

 in one of the most civilized countries of Europe, namely, in France. About this 

 we have very interesting information in Dr. Foville's "Traite complet de l'anato- 

 raie, de la physiologie et de la palhologie du systeme nerveux cerebrospinal, le 

 partie, Ana":omie, Paris, 1844, page 632, art. " Deformation artificielle du crane" 

 etc. ; et Atlas, PI. 23, figs. 1, 2." 



Dr. Foville says namely: "Dans plusieurs parties da la France, on coiffe Ies 

 nouveaunes de bonnets fixes sur la circonference du crane lui-meme. Tantot 

 on commence par l'entourer d'un etroit et long triangle de toile, qui decrit 

 plusieurs tours avant d'etre arrete, et par dessus ce serre-tete ou bandeau on 

 place un bonnet rond a coulisses, dont les cordons sont serres suivant la _me

circonference que ce serre-tete lui-meme. Cette pratique est tres commune eu

 d'un bandeau ; on la couvre d'un bonnet rond, et ce bonnet se trouve ensuite 

 assujetti par un nombre variable de tours de bande methodiquenient jetes depuis 

 les bosses frontales jusqu'aux bosses parietales. C'est ainsi qu'on agit a Toulouse 

 et dans une grande etendue des pays voisins Une constriction circu-

 tendre a cet age. Ce qu'elle perde alors en largeur, elle le gagne en exces de 

 longueur; et c'est ainsi que se trouvent produits ces cranes allonges et eylin- 

 droi'des, (voy. pi. 22 et 23, fig. 1), quelquefois meme etrangles dans le milieu 

 de leur longueur, qu'on rencontre en proportions variables dans presque toutes 

 les maisons d'alienes de France, mais surtout dans celles des departements ou 

 la methode adoptee pour la coiffure des enfants implique une constriction circu- 

 late. On trouve des personnes du Limousin, de Bretagne, du Nord et du Nord- 

 Est de la France avec une deformation evidente du crane dont la cause ne peut 

 etre douteuse. ... A Paris, ou se trouvent rassembles des habitants de toutes 

 les parties de la France, toutes les habitudes de nos provinces se trouvent 

 importees, et les deformations du crane produites par les coiffures vicieuses ne 

 sont nullement rares.'' 



The 23d engraving in Dr. Foville's work shows three side-faces of women whose 

 skulls are formed very like the Hunish. Dr. Foville has, in quality of chief- 

 physician at the great asylums for insane in the Department Seine-inferieure and 

 Oharenton, had occasion to examine the skulls of a great number of country 

 people. Here he has found several individuals with thus artificially formed 

 heads. Though he expresses the opinion that the deformity does not disturb the 

 functions of the brain, he believes that it does not seldom promote disorders 

 which finally cause mental derangement. This does not agree with Morton's 

 opinion about this circumstance among the American Indians. It is more 

 probable that the worthy author here has taken post hoc for propter hoc. He 

 mentions two different manners of constricting the head. It seems not probable 

 that this custom is intended for changing the form of the head ; it rather seems 

 as if it remained unconsciously from the time of Paganism, and will as many 

 other prejudices, first cease by some particular accident. The inhabitants of 

 Normandy were Norwegians ; the race which before inhabited the country is 

 probably not yet extinct. On the contrary we believe that here, as in many other 

 countries, the ancient population lives beside the more aristocratic conquering 

 nation. This latter, the Rep. has himself had occasion to observe, keeps still the 

 true Norman type. Doctor Foville himself, of Normannic family, is a beautiful 

 proof of this. The Rep. does not believe that the pressing of the head does 

 derive from the Norwegians. The skulls of fig. 1, 2, tab. 23 of his work, do 

 not show the least resemblance with the Norwegian dolichocephalic ones ; but 

 rather seem to be brachycephalic. The skull, tab. 22, is, according to the opinion 

 of the Rep., of genuine gaulic type, low, long, dolichocephalic, not artificially 

 formed. It was taken in a churchyard at Paris, and we know nothing about the 

 person it has belonged to. It is worthy of attention that this custom is common 

 in Bretagne, the old county Toulouse, and in several places where the Celtic 

 race is the predominant one, these countries have before been inhabited by Celts 

 and first by Iberians. In Beam, where the Iberian race is the most numerous, the 

 constriction of the head is, according to Dr. Foville 1 s account, not used. After all 

 thesp facts have been mentioned, the question naturally arises : Has this 

 custom arisen by itself separately in the Old and New World, or does it not bear 

 witness of a communication between the New and Old World ? The Rep. hopes 

 on some other occasion to return to the question.

titled " Indications of five species, with two new genera of extinct 

 Fishes." Referred to Mr. Cassin, Dr. Le Conte and Dr. Henderson. 



Mr. Cassin announced that M. Duchaillu was about to return to 

 Western Africa, for the purpose exclusively of geographical explora- 

 tion, and the collection of objects of Natural History. Arrangements 

 have been made to secure, for the cabinet of this Society, the collections 

 of Birds especially, and also of some other objects. Mr. Cassin ex- 

 plained the general design of the Expedition, which was to pass from 

 Cape Lopez, 1 S. latitude, towards the supposed source of the Congo 

 river, with the intention of attempting to reach its source. 



M. Duchaillu has already penetrated farther into the interior of this 

 part of Africa than any other white man. The coast is unknown farther 

 inland than from twenty to twenty-five miles, except to slavers, there 

 having been no exploration of that part of Africa. M. Duchaillu had 

 been on the Rivers Moonda and Mouni, had traced the latter to its 

 source, and had ascertained the existence of high mountains, probably 

 a continuation or spur of the Atlas range, and much further south than 

 is to be found in any published maps. 



Another fact ascertained by him, is the existence of a very populous 

 nation, of marked negro character, known as the Powein Nation, which 

 he estimates at from five to seven millions. Their country extends 

 across from the sources of the Moonda, probably to the sources of the 

 Nile, and the nation is probably that mentioned by Bruce, as occasional- 

 ly descending the Nile. It is a warlike and cannibal nation, engaged 

 in agriculture, not wandering, resembling in this respect the Ashantees 

 and Dahomeys. It displays the highest degree of civilization yet ob- 

 served among the true negroes, presenting an analogy to the Feejees, 

 among the Oceanic nations. M. Duchaillu possesses peculiar advantages 

 as an explorer. He has lived long in the country, is entirely acclimated, 

 speaks well two of the languages, and understands thoroughly the negro 

 character. He proposes to proceed merely with convoys of natives 

 from each tribe successively to the next.

Catalogue of Marine Alg^e, discovered at Beesley's Point during the past summer, 



with some remarks thereon. 



By Samuel Ashmead. 



Beesley's Point is situated in Cape May County, N. J., on the southern side of 

 the Great Egg-Harbor Bay, about three miles from the ocean. The bay is about 

 four miles in length, with an average breadth of two miles, when it connects 

 with the inlet at the Beach. The water (with the exception of the channels) is 




1855.] 411 



shoal, interspersed with sedge islands, sand-bars, oyster and clam beds. The 

 main channel, is deep, narrow, and crooked ; and to a person unacquainted 

 with the course, difficult to navigate. 



Connected with the bay, on the south, is a flat called "Bond's-bar," contain- 

 ing some hundreds of acres, which, on the recess of the tide, is left nearly bare. 



A vigorous growth of Zostera marina occupies a large portion of this bar. 



A narrow channel half a mile in length, and leading into " Little Bay " on 

 the south, separates this bar from the main land, which is Beesley's Point. 

 " Little Bay," when viewed from the main land at high water, presents the 

 appearance of a lake, a mile in length, and nearly the same in width. The 

 water is shoal, and when the tide is out, a mud-flat of considerable extent is left 

 bare. 



At the head of Little Bay, is a thoroughfare extending south, parallel with 

 the coast line, and navigable for boats to Cape Island. This thoroughfare is 

 frequently branched, forming islands, and sometimes extends into wide bays. 

 It connects with the sea by various inlets, the most important of which is 

 Corson's, Townsend's and Hereford, forming narrow islands known as " Beaches/' 

 and called respectively "Peck's Beach," " Ludlum's Beach" and "Learning's 

 Beach." 



The sea along the sandy coast is shallow, and the action of the breakers vio- 

 lent, which, together with frequent heavy gales from the north east, render it 

 peculiarly unfavorable for the growth of marine vegetation. Yet when we explore 

 the inlets, the thoroughfares, and the land-locked bays with their coves, secure 

 from the violence of winds and waves, we find them far from being so unprolific 

 as they might seem. The sandy-mud bottoms of these shallow waters will be 

 found carpeted with the beautiful membranous expansions of the Viva latisssi?na, 

 mingling with the elongated fronds of Enteromorpha intestinalis, whilst a luxurious 

 growth of Zostera marina affords a resting-place for the floating spores of the 

 gaudy Rhodosperms. 



The total absence of rocks, or stones of any kind, (save a few small pebbles 

 on the southern shore of the Great Egg-Harbor Bay) produces an unceasing de- 

 mand for a favorable place for the future growth and propagation of species. 



Hence, every submerged substance suited to their condition, is immediately 

 invested not only with Alga, but with Sertularice and various other Zoophytes. 



The limited number of the species of marine Algcc at Beesley's Point must be 

 attributed to the want of a suitable place, or foot-hold for development, as the 

 climate and the water, it would seem, supply all the other conditions favorable 

 to their growth. 



The following catalogue, embracing five Melanosperms, nineteen Rhodo- 

 sperms, and six Chlorosperms, are all that I have as yet been able to detect. A 

 more careful search may probably supply a few more species. 



In the classification, and names of the species, I have followed that emi- 

 nent Algologist, Hon. Win. H. Harvey, in his "Nereis Boreali- Americana,'' pub- 

 lished by the Smithsonian Institute at Washington. 



Series I. MELANOSPERMELE. 



Fucus vesiculosus, Linn. Very common between tide marks, on the shores 

 of the Bays, and the thoroughfares ; not unfrequently attached to sods by a root 

 penetrating several inches into the soil, throwing off numerous lateral slioots 

 having the appearance of undeveloped fronds, forming a strong hold-fast, and 

 affording an interesting illustration of the modification of a discoid root, where 

 local circumstances are unfavorable to such expansions. It is, however, more 

 frequently found adhering by a conical disc to mussels, {Modiola plicatula) 

 which, at high water, unable to resist the buoyancy of the full grown planl with 

 its inflated vesicles, are, by degrees, wrested from their place of growth and cast 

 upon the shore to perish, when the Fucus together with other marine plaots are- 

 carried away by the inhabitants for manure. 



Stilophori rhizodes, J. Ag. Rather rare ; on old shells, &c , near low- water 

 mark. The few specimens which I obtained are fertile, of vigorous growth, 

 and densely covered with wart-like fructification. 




412 [October, 



Ectocarpus littoralis, Lyngb. Very abundant in the Bays, on various sub- 

 merged substances. Also fringing the steep banks of the thoroughfares be- 

 tween tide marks. Disappearing in July. 



Ectocarpus siliculosus, Lyngb. Occurs sparingly on the shores of Little 

 Bay, on Fucas vesiculosus. 



Ectocarpus viridis, Harv. Common in the Bays, on Zostera marina, &c. Dis- 

 appearing in July. 



Series II. RHODOSPERME^E. 

 Chondria dasyphylla, Ag. Plentiful in Little Bay, and on " Bond's Bar/' 

 growing in large tufts on the sandy mud, to which it is attached by a fibrous 

 root. 



Chondria Baileyana, Mont. Common with the above. 



Polysiphonia Olneyi, Harv. Rare, on Zostera marina in "Little Bay." 



Polysiphonia Harveyi, Bailey. Very abundant in the Bays, and on Bond's 

 Bar ; on Zostera marina. 



Polysiphonia variegata, Ag. Very common, on Zostera marina, also at- 

 tached to the mud by a fibrous root. 



Polysiphonia nigrescens, Grev. I collected fine specimens of this most va- 

 riable plant, in fruit, in the month of May. It occurs in great abundance in Lit- 

 tle Bay, attached to the bottom by a fibrous root. 



Champia parvula, Harv. Plentiful in Little Bay, on Zostera marina. < 

 Grinnellia Americana, Harv. Of this beautiful plant I only found a soli- 

 tary perfect specimen. It was growing in the Great Egg-Harbor Bay near the 

 shore, attached to the bottom by a somewhat fibrous root. The frond consists 

 of a leaf-like expansion, four inches long, and two inches wide. Several leaf- 

 lets, in as many stages of development, spring from the base of the midrib, 

 giving evidence of vitality. 



I had previously discovered fragments of this interesting plant, cast ashore 

 near the inlet, and also in the Great Egg-Harbor Bay, one of which I sent to 

 Professor Bailey of West Point, who suggested that it was a drift specimen, 

 probably from the narrows of New York Bay, where it occurs abundantly. 

 Notwithstanding that these fragments may have been stragglers, I have had suf- 

 ficient evidence that this species is an inhabitant of Beesley's Point, and there- 

 fore give it a place in my catalogue. 



Gracilaria multipartita, J. Ag. Plentiful, particularly fine on planted 

 oysters in Little Bay. 



Solieria chordalis, J. Ag. Very common on all the shores. There can be 

 no doubt, but this bushy plant will grow and flourish in the coves of Little 

 Bay, and other sheltered situations, without a foothold, for I have rarely found 

 it attached to the bottom. 



Chylocladia Baileyana, Harv. Frequent on Zostera marina, Ulva latissima, &c 



Spyridia filamentosa, Hnrv. Particularly abundant and vigorous in the 

 Bays ; where, sheltered from the winds and waves, like the Solieria chordalis, it 

 will luxuriate without the slightest attachment to the bottom. 



Ceramium rubrum, Ag. This plant, in all its perplexing varieties, is found on 

 Zostera marina, rather abundantly. 



Ceramium diaphanum, Roth. Occurs sparingly associated with the above. 



Ceramium fastigiatum, Harv. In dense tufts, on Zostera marina, rather rare. 



Callithamnion byssoideum, Am. Frequent on Zostera marina, also attached 

 to old shells in Great Egg-Harbor Bay. 



Callithamnion polyspermum, Ag. Rare, on old shells in Great Egg-Harbor 

 Bay. 



Gklidium corneum, var. y. pinnatum, Grev. I obtained two or three speci- 

 mens of this plant in Little Bay, on old shells, near low-water mark. 




1355.] 4 



id 



T close the list of Rhodosperms with some remarks on an interesting plant, for 

 which, as yet, I have no name. I obtained upwards of twenty specimens of this 

 Alga during July and August. They were cast ashore near the inlet of Great 

 Egg Harbor Bay, parasitical on TJlva latissima, Zoster a marina, and Gracilaria 

 multipartita, associated with Chylocladia Baileyana. I sought diligently for fertile 

 specimens, but without success. 



This plant, in the articulations of the frond, shows a tendency towards Grif- 

 fithsia setacea, from which, however, it differs greatly in some of its other 

 characters. 



The branching of G. setacea is on the dichotomous model, and the axils are 

 acute, whilst in this plant the branching is irregular, showing a tendency to 

 secund ramification, and the axils are obtuse, particularly in the ramuli, where 

 they are found to be almost horizontally patent, which is sufficient to distinguish 

 it from G. setacea. 



Perhaps one of the most remarkable characters of this Alga is that the ramuli 

 generally issue from the middle of the internodes, which, according to Harvey, 

 would exclude it even from the Order Ceramiacece, to which ihe genus Griffithsia 

 belongs. 



Under the natural character of the Order Ceramiacece, Harvey remarks as fol- 

 lows : "In the simpler species, the frond consists of an articulated filament, 

 formed of a number of cylindrical cells or articulations, placed end to end. This 

 filament is either dichotomously or pinnately branched, the branches being similar 

 to the main stem, and always springing from the upper part of each internode (or 

 articulation) either from its shoulder, or from a short distance below that point. 1 ' 

 See Nereis Boreali- Americana, page 206. 



These different characters have been made available by Algologists for the 

 purpose of classification, and if they are to be regarded as of primary conse- 

 quence, this plant is certainly new to our coast, if not to science. 



The following are some of its principal characters, which may serve to dis- 

 tinguish it, until fertile specimens shall be obtained. Frond terete; tubular; 

 monosiphonous ; rosy-red ; two to four inches long ; not much thicker than a 

 human hair; soft but not gelatinous ; does not readily decompose in fresh water, 

 nor adhere strongly to paper in drying. Conspicuously articulated throughout ; 

 the lower articulations many times longer than their diameter; internodes more 

 or less swollen ; nodes consist of narrow pellucid bands, on either side of which 

 is a ring of deep crimson, gradually fading towards the central region of the 

 internode. 



The branching irregular ; sometimes showing a tendency to secund ramifica- 

 tion ; branchlets beset at unequal intervals with secund, spindle-shaped ramuli, 

 half a lioe to four or five lines in length, frequently horizontally patent, generally 

 issuing from the middle of the internodes, and sometimes much attenuated at the 

 point of insertion. 



Apices furnished with several whorls of exceedingly minute dichotomous hairs, 

 oaly visible under the microscope. 



Series III. CHLOROSPERME.E. 



Bryopsis plumosa, Ag. Not common ; attached to old shells and other sub- 

 merged substances on the shore of Great Egg Harbor Bay. 



Cladophora palcata, Harv. Occurs plentiful in Little Bay. 



Enteromorpiia compressa, Grev. Very common everywhere ; infesting the 

 small pebbles on Great Egg Harbor Bay. 



Enteromorpiia intestinalis, Link. Abundant in Little Bay, and on Bond's 

 Bar. Frequently found floating in large quantities in the Bays. 



TJlva latissima, Linn. Common with the above. 



Porphyra vulgaris, Ag. Very rare. I have obtained but two or three speci- 

 meas of this Alga, on Zostera marina in Little Bay. 




414 [October, 



Indications of five sp ties, with two neio genera, of extinct Fishes. 



By Joseph Leidy, M. D. 



1. Sicarius extinctus, Leidy. A species of a new genus, most probably of 

 fishes, but it may be of reptiles. It is founded upon the specimen of a tooth, or 

 it may be a scale or a spine ; and it consists of two portions. The body has 

 much the form of the scales of the Manis, but is surrounded at base with a thick 

 collar marked with close parallel ridges. The breadth of the body in its perfect 

 condition has been 15 lines ; its depth on the convex side 9 lines, and on the 

 vertical slightly concave side 11 lines. The root is 10J lines in breadth and 

 narrow towards the extremity, which is broken off, and it measures on one side 

 6 lines and on the other 4} lines in length. 



The specimen was obtained from a black stratum, belonging to the coal series, 

 in number 13 of Rogers, at the head of inclined plane No. 3, of the old portage 

 portion of the Pennsylvania Railroad. It was presented by Townsend Ward, 

 E3q., to Charles A. Poulson, Esq., from whom Mr. Conrad borrowed it for my 

 inspection. 



2. Edestus vorax, Leidy. A species of a new genus of fishes, founded on 

 the fragment of a jaw with portions of four teeth. The fragment of jaw is 3 

 inches in breadth by 10 lines in thickness at the dental border, and nearly double 

 that thickness at the opposed border, which is convex. It is composed of four 

 wedge-like segments excavated at base, so that those posteriorly are inserted into 

 those anteriorly, and each has a tooth coossified at the narrower border in^the 

 same plane as the broad surfaces of the specimen. The teeth resemble those of 

 Charcharodon, and in their perfect condition have been about 2 inches long, and 

 have had nearly the same breadth at base. They have strongly and coarsely 

 dentated borders, and are thinly coated with enamel. 



In relation to the affinities of the singular fish to which the fragment belonged 

 and its exact position in the skullf T suspect it to have been a portion of the upper 

 jaw of a genus allied to Lepidosteus, from the circumstance that the latter, in like 

 manner, has the upper jaw composed of a number of distinct segments. 



The specimen is most probably from the carboniferous series, and it was ob- 

 tained by "William S. Vaux, Esq., from an itinerant showman, who found it at 

 Frozen Rock, Arkansas River, 20 miles below Fort Gibson, in the Indian Terri- 

 tory. 



3. Oracanthus vetustus, Leidy. This species is founded on an ichthyodorulite, 

 the body of which in its perfect condition has been about 6 inches in length, and 

 it measures 1\ inches in breadth at base. The broad surfaces and slightly con- 

 cave border are thickly covered with mamillary tubercles arranged in very 

 irregular, transverse rows, and unsymmetrically on the two broad sides. 



The specimen is from Missouri Territory, and formerly belonged to Mr. Conrad's 

 collection now in possession of this Academy. Adhering to its base there is a 

 portion of black shale with a partially imbedded segment of an encrenite stem, 

 which Mr. Conrad considers as fixing the specimen in the carboniferous series. 



4. Pristis curvidens, Leidy. This species is based on a single tooth 5 inches 

 long by 8 lines wide at the point of exsertion. The posterior border at its 

 thickest part is 4J lines, is straight throughout, and only at its outer two-fifths 

 is slightly depressed. The anterior border is convex ; and the tooth is con- 

 siderably curved downward. 



The specimen was discovered by W. Taylor, Esq., in the Green Sand, near 

 Pemberton, New Jersey. 



5. Pristis ensidens, Leidy. This species is founded on numerous specimens 

 of teeth, of which the largest in their perfect condition have been about 1^ 

 inches long by 7 \ lines broad at base. They are straight and have both borders 

 equally acute and convex. 



The specimens were discovered by Capt. Bowman, U. S. A., in the sands of 

 Ashley River, South Carolina. 



Mr. Ilene La Roche Jr., and Dr. Samuel Lewis, of Philadelphia, were 

 elected Members.

 and a round one near the apex of each elytron, sutural lines slightly elevated ; 

 the three medial, and subsutural ones a little punctured at base : pygidium 

 somewhat coarsely punctulate, punctures becoming finer at base : legs finety 

 punctulate, patella more coarsely so : a large deep fovea upon the base of the 

 postpectas, posteriorly : venter with gradually enlarging punctures, increasing 

 in size toward the base. 



CHLOROPHANUS, Dalman. 



C. ? undulatus. Black ; thorax obsoletely margined, silvery white at the 

 sides; elytra with irregular, silvery undulations at sides; variegated silvery 

 white behind the middle. 4 lines long including rostrum. Baltimore. 



Black, beneath silvery : head scabrous ; rostrum tinged with silvery at sides ; 

 antenna? black, club dusky; eyes black; thorax constricted posteriorly, finely 

 shagreened; medial thoracic line impressed; obsoletely margined, silvery at

sides: antepectus somewhat regularly punctured, punctures elevated: scutel 

 black : elytra punctate-striate, interstitial lines elevated ; an irregular undulating 

 silvery vitta upon the lateral submargins, extending from humeral angle to apex, 

 interrupted in the middle, and merging into scattered variegations behind the 

 sutural middle : legs with cupreous reflections, finely pubescent ; a silvery spot 

 immediately in front of posterior coxa? : venter punctulate, silvery. A very dis- 

 tinct and beautiful insect, which I doubtingly refer to the genus cited. A very 

 rare species, two individuals only having occurred. 



BARIDIUS, Sch. 



B. pubescens. Entirely covered with dense, fulvous pubescence. 



4 lines long to tip of rostrum. Virginia. 



Densely yellowish pubescent : head, rostrum and eyes piceous-black, rostrum

 cent, pile running transversely each side from the middle, middle slightly 

 elevated: legs and feet pubescent: elytra striate punctate, punctures not visible 

 through the pubescence : beneath densely pubescent. 



A very distinct species, and may be easily recognized by the uniform long 

 yellowish pubescence with which the whole body is invested. Rubbed specimens 

 appear brownish, the pubescence being very deciduous.

 front with yellowish hairs ; frontal line entire, a longitudinal elevation each side 

 at base; antennae annulate with black, 1st joint thickened at extremity: thorax 

 anteriorly and posteriorly, sparsely and coarsely punctured, three spinous tuber- 

 cles on the middle placed laterally, external ones bipartite, lateral spines hardly 

 acute: scutel with two round dots of black pile, densely pubescent: elytra 

 roughly shagreened, slightly elevated each side, behind the scutel ; humeri pro- 

 minent, acute; 4 elevated striae containing black dots, lateral and sutural mar- 

 gins dotted black; also 4 black dots on each side, one near the lateral margin, 

 one behind the humerus, one immediately in front of the apex, and a large 

 somewhat lunate (anteriorly emarginate, and posteriorly trifurcate) spot, the 

 outside branch of which runs obliquely outwards, each spot surrounded with a 

 fulvous margin ; tips obliquely truncated, slightly divaricate : femora stroDgly 

 clavate, black at tip and reddish at base, tibia? annulate with black, tarsi black- 

 ish, pulvilli yellow; venter terminal segments almost without pubescence. 



1 take great pleasure in dedicating this beautiful insect to the Rev. John G 

 Morris, as a slight testimonial of my esteem for him as an eminent Entomologist, 

 and liberal patron of the natural sciences. 



DORCASCHEMA, Lee. 



D. Wildii. Ground color brown, entirely invested with dense cinereous pubes- 

 cence ; antenna? basal joints finely pointed with brown ; lateral yellowish vitta 

 extending from behind the eyes to apex of elytra. 10 lines long; (elytra 7;)

 beautifully marked with fine brown points, humeral angles prominent, base 

 coarsely and closely punctured, becoming less so posteriorly : legs densely 

 pubescent, finely and closely brown-punctured : venter ciliate at tip. 



It affordes me much pleasure in dedicating this fine insect to Mr. J. P. Wild, 




418 [December 



as a slight testimony of nay esteem for him as a zealous prosecutor of Entomo- 

 logical research. This rare and beautiful insect was first obtained in Baltimore 

 on the common Grape, but a specimen was brought from Evansville, Ind., by Mr. 

 Wild, who obtained it from the Mulberry, and another specimen has since been 

 captured by me upon that tree. 



PACHNEPHORUS, Chevr. 



P. viticolus. Brownish-black, clothed with a dense ashy pubescence ; be- 

 neath, and legs blackish. 2h lines long. Baltimore.

 blackish ; palpi and basal joints of the antennae testaceous, terminal joints 

 dusky above : thorax finely, and densely punctured ; rather dilated in the middle : 

 scutellum densely pubescent : elytra punctate-striate, interstices finely shagreened ; 

 ground color a little lighter upon the tips : beneath, and legs blackish ; articula- 

 tions of the legs faintly reddish-testaceous.

Dr. J. Aitken Meigs presented for publication, a revised edition of the 

 Catalogue of Human Crania in the collection of the late Dr. Samuel 

 George Morton : 



Since the death of Dr. Morton, his magnificent collection of Human Crania, 

 recently increased by the receipt of 40 skulls from various sources, has been 

 permanently deposited in the Museum of the Academy. Prior to his decease, 

 Dr. M. had received about 100 crania, in addition to those mentioned in the third 

 edition of this catalogue. Since 1849, therefore, the collection has been aug- 

 mented by the addition of 140 skulls. 



To complete the catalogue in a uniform manner, these have been carefully 

 numbered and measured in accordance with the methods recorded in the Crania 

 Americana, &c. In a portion of these measurements, I was kindly assisted by 

 our fellow-member, Dr. Thomas J. Turner, of the United States Navy. 



The entire collection, numbering 1007 crania, was purchased by 42 gentle- 

 men, from the executors of Dr. Morton, for the sum of $4000, and by them 

 generously presented to the Academy.* 



The collection occupies 16 cases on the first gallery, on the south side of the 

 lower room of the Museum. For convenience of study and examination, I 

 have grouped it according to Race, Family, Tribe, &c, strictly adhering, however, 

 to the classification of Dr. Morton. It will be seen, also, that the same arrange- 

 ment has been adopted in this edition of the catalogue, so that it is an exact re- 

 presentation of the collection as it stands upon the shelves. While the old 

 numbering has been carefully preserved for the sake of reference to the various 

 published descriptions of Dr. Morton, new numbers have been added to desig- 

 nate the position of any skuli in the natural division or sub-division to which it 

 belongs. 



The crania are distributed as follows : 



*See Proceedings of the Academy, vol. vi. pp. 321, 324. 

 f Dr. Morton used the term Pelasgic too comprehensively. 

 Armenians and Persians should not be placed in this group.

Extensive and unique as is this collection, it is, nevertheless, still too limited 

 to justify any positive and comprehensive conclusions concerning the great 

 fundamental problems of Ethnology. That it will be capable, wheu sufficiently 

 extended, of throwing much lght upon these obscure and unsettled questions, is 

 amply attested by the scientific publications of Dr. Morton. It is earnestly hoped, 

 therefore, that this magnificent nucleus, the result of much pecuniary sacrifice 

 and many years of enthusiastic labor on the part of its late illustrious owner 

 aad founder, will not be Deglected ; but that its efficiency will be increased, and 

 the objects for which it was gathered together attained by contributions from 

 all who may be interested in the advancement of this youngest, most intricate 

 and most important of the sciences. 



The Norwegians and Danes of the Scandinavian race ; the Bas-Bretons ; the 

 Celtic Scotch, Welsh, French, Spanish and Portuguese; the Ancient and Modern 

 Greeks: the Magyar people ; the Great Tartar and" Scythic hordes; the entire 

 Basque Family, and many other races, are without a single representative in the 

 collection. Of the Polar and Tchudic Families it contains but 4, and skulls 

 respectively; while the ancient Romans and their descendants, the modern 

 Transteverini beyond the Tibeu< the great Sclavic race and the Berber tribes 

 are each renresented by but one skull. 



These deficiencies and many others could be particularized are recorded in 

 the hope that the attention of the scientific community being directed to them, 

 they will sooner or later, be supplied. 



On motion of Mr. Lea, it was ordered that a set of the Proceedings, 

 as far as published, be presented to Prince Charles Bonaparte. 



On motion of Mr. Hanson, it was resolved that an invitation be ex- 

 tended to the Educational Convention about to meet in this city, to 

 visit the Museum of the Academy.

Descriptive Catalogue of the Ranina of the United Slates. 

 By John Le Conte. 



On account of the numerous errors which have been introduced into that pait 

 of the Heruetology of our country, which treats of the froes and allied animals, 

 1 have been induced in this short memoir, to reduce sach as I ba\e been able to 

 obtain, to some better order. I offer but a descriptive catalogue. To this are 

 joined all the synonyms which I have been able to collect from works which 

 could be consulted in this city. 



Before I begin, it is necessary to observe that all the Ranina which I have ever 

 seen, have more or less the power of changing color at will. The character of 

 color therefore, of so much moment in the description of many other animals, is 

 here of very little value; for none of the marks dependant on it are constant. 

 In consequence, it requires numerous specimens, living subjects and locg study 

 to produce any description that approaches perfection. 



How far I have succeeded in my attempt remains to be seen. I have been 

 long and sedulously engaged in my researches. Every description has been 

 made from living specimens. The many strange errors and misnomeis pointed 

 out will perhaps appear at first sight extraordinary and not worthy of belief; 

 but it is to be hoped that the reasoning which has led me to differ so much from 

 others, will produce the same effect upon the minds of my readers as it has upon 

 mine.

Add to the descriptions already given, a short raised line runs from the back 

 of the orbit, to the tympanum and is curved down behind it. Body above finely 

 granulate, more distinctly at the base of the jaws. Color above olive green and 

 olive brown of every shade, irregularly spotted and blotched with dusky, or 

 uniform brownish dusky without any visible variegation except on the fore part 

 of the head, where there iS in all an inclination to green ; in some few the whole 

 body above is green. A deep depression under the nostrils. Beneath white or 

 yellowish white, sometimes without spots or spotted with dusky only on the 

 chin, sometimes spotted or blotched all over, or again dusky or black spotted and 

 varied with white. 



Length from nose to the tip of the toes 20 inches. 



Inhabits from oce end of the country to the other. 



R. nigrescexs Agassiz. Agas. Lake Superior p. 879. 



Above very rough with numerous warts, dusky, blackish brown or dark brown, 

 more or less distincly spotted with darker, the spots frequently angular ; a 

 longitudinal cutaneous fold runs on each side of the back from the orbits to the 

 vent. Bo<3y beneath punctate, whitish, very much varied on the chin with black, 

 sides slightly spotted with white : the under and hind part of the thighs spotted 

 or sometimes varied with black, the under side of the tibia? and feet are likewise 

 yellowish with some few spots of black. 



Length 2.5 in., arm 1.9 in., leg 3.9. 



Inhabits Lake Superior, particularly on the north side. 



This species has by some been considered as a variety of the R. fontinalis, to 




424 [December, 



which species it bears only a remote resemblance. The illustrious naturalist to 

 whom we owe the first description of this animal was not so ignorant as to con- 

 found the two together.

A glandulous raised line always extends from the orbit to the sacral promi- 

 nence. The color varies, being ashy grey, greyish or blackish brown, olive, 

 yellowish green, rarely brown with a bronze reflection, sometimes without spots, 

 most frequently spotted with dark brown or dusky, particularly on the sides, 

 which are always lighter colored than the back. Beneath white or white spotted 

 or varied with dusky or brown. 



Inhabits the Northern States in springs or rivulets of cold water. In the 

 southern parts of our country the water is doubtless too warm for its existence.

Above smooth, with, some scattered warts or small tubercles either round or 

 oblong, sometimes uniting so as to form four raised lines the anterior abbreviated 

 both before and behind, the^posterior only before, but both tubercles and lines 

 depending for their appearance on the will of the animal. Behind the eyes are 

 sometimes observed some large punctures. Color green, brownish green, brown 

 of various degrees of intensity, reddish and dusky, varying to all these at the 

 will of the animal ; when brown they have frequently a metallic gloss. The 

 upper lip and tympanum are often golden. When found in a state of torpidity 

 they are frequently almost black. There is a raised whitish line extending from 

 under the eye to the insertion of the fore leg, and we never fail to find a raised 

 cutaneous fold or line of white or yellowish extending from the orbit to the hind 

 part of the body ; this together with the spots on the sides and back, form the 

 proper characteristics of this species, yet I have one before me that has but five 

 spots on the back, three on one side and two on the other with none on the sides. 

 The lower part of the sides of this near the groin are bluish. This species has 

 a vocal vesicle on the side of each jaw like the R. esculenta. 



I have restored to this speeies its original name of pipiens. Kalm has some 

 how or other the credit of giving to it the name of halecina, upon what authority 

 I cannot find, neither can I see how the name fits. The word halec in Latin 

 signified a kind of sauce apparently like that we now call anchovy sauce. 

 Afterwards it came to mean any kind of small and cheap fish, by no means how- 

 ever either herring or shad, both of which must have been unknown to the 

 Romans before the conquest of Gaul. How the name was taken from this species 

 and given to the bull frog it would be difficult to discover. No one who knew 

 any thing of the two animals, would confound the soft peeping sound of a 

 chicken with the loud roaring of a bull.

The hind part of the thighs is always yellow spotted with black. It is re- 

 markable for its strong and disagreeable odor. Much resembles the preceding, 

 but is distinguished at once by the two raised lines on the back being wanting; 

 these never fail in the R. pipiens. It sometimes has the black spots on the top 

 of the back connected into two longitudinal bands. 



R. clamator. R clamata Daudin 1. c. p. 54. R. clamitans Merrem. p. 176. 



Above smooth, with a few scattered warts, dark olive, cinereous or dark green, 

 with a few irregular black spots, and frequently with a darker line extending 

 from the orbits to the insertion of the hind legs. Beneath smooth white, more 

 or less varied with du3ky. Upper eyelid smooth, tympan brown, vomerian teeth 

 small, the two clusters nearly joined together. Arms and legs barred with dusky, 

 fingers a little dilated at the tips, the first equal to or longer than the second ana

perfectly free, that is to say without any web ; between the second and third and 

 third and fourth, there is a slight appearance of palrnation or a webbed membrane. 

 The webs of the toes do not reach to their points : the second toe is one third 

 longer than any of the others, and is naked for a greater length. 



Length 1.8 in., arms 1.1 in., legs 2.65 in. 



This is the true H. clamator of Bosc, (not clamata which is a misreading of 

 Mr. Bosc'a name); this name has been given by Dr. Holbrook to a species which 

 I have never seen. 



R. cokspersa. 



Head punctured and wrinkled in a daedal manner. Body above smooth or 

 warty at the will of the animal, sometimes these warts being so arranged as to 

 resemble a cutaneous, fold on the sides of the back. Beneath white, sha- 

 greened or very finely granulate. Color above green or greenish cinereous, 

 or cinereous sometimes varied on the greener jaws and on the sides with white. 

 Top of the back with an infinity of small dots of paler, and marked with nume- 

 rous small, round, irregularly scattered spots of dusky, which are however some- 

 times nearly evanescent. Chin and throat frequently tesselate with dusky. 

 Arms brownish spotted with dusky. Legs above brownish, varied with darker ; 

 hind part of the thighs warty, dirty white varied with dark brown, or pale brown 

 varied with darker, beneath spotted with brown, tibia above a little warty, almost 

 always with a few transverse bars of darker, beneath pale brown, third and 

 fourth toes much longer in proportion than in other species, toes not dilated at 

 the tips. 



Length 1.8 in., arm and hand 1 in., leg 3 in., thigh 1.6 in., tibia and foot .94, 

 tympanum .15. 



Inhabits Pennsylvania in ponds and ditches. 



Individuals are found which at times have the warts on the back arranged in 

 such a manner as to simulate a cutaneous fold ; beneath this there is sometimes 

 likewise a short line of the same kind. 



A young one of this species which I kept for a long time in a glass jar along 

 with many others, was able to climb up the vessel in which he was imprisoned 

 and to support himself there as well as a Hyla would have been able to do. 



It has been thought by some that this was nothing more than a young bull-

 before it loses its tail is frequently three inches long in the body.

This species has sometimes the dark baron the head scarcely distinguishable, 

 in others it is entirely wanting ; it resembles the Rana temporaria of Europe 

 very much, and requires a rigid examination to determine that it is not the 

 same. It does not inhabit the Southern States at least in the lower country. 



R. CAPITO. 



Above very rough, dark grey or slate-color speckled with black with six 

 rows of roundish spots on the back ; sides speckled and irregularly marked 

 with spots of the same form and color ; from the orbits to beyond the middle 

 of the body runs a broad raised line or cutaneous fold ; and another from 

 the corner of the mouth to the insertion of the arm. Beneath smooth, yellowish 

 white, speckled, spotted and varied with dusky ; top of the head coarsely punc- 

 tured, back and side3 tuberculous. Head very large, broad and blunt, a deep 

 concavity between the nostrils and the eyes. Irids golden mixed with black. 

 Tympanum of the color of the body. Lower jaw with a small protuberance or 

 point resembling a tooth. Arms and legs above grey, speckled and barred with 

 black ; beneath yellowish spotted and varied with dusky, the yellowish color 

 more decided at the axillae and groins. Hind part of the thighs granulate. Fingera 

 slightly palmate at the base, the first longer than the second. The second toe 

 twice a3 long as the first. 



Length 4-2 in., width of the head at the corners of the mouth 1-5 in., arm 1-87, 

 leg 4- , 75, thigh 1-1 in., tibia 1-45, foot 2 2. 



Inhabits Georgia in the ditches of the rice-fields. (Plate V.)

Above more or less granulate with small scattered warts, cinereous or dark 

 slate color, speckled all over with whitish or pale brownish grey, and with 

 brown or dusky ; beneath whitish, spotted and varied with dusky, particularly 

 on the throat and under side of the legs. Head small, vertex plane ; irids gold- 

 en ; tympanum small, scarcely visible from its color. Arms of the color of 

 of the body, spotted more especially behind, fingers slightly webbed, the first 

 much shorter than the second. Legs obscurely barred with darker, feet fully 

 palmate. 



Length 2-25, width of head -7, length of the same arm 1-5, leg 3-44, thigh -9, 

 tibia 1-04, foot 1-5. 



Inhabits Georgia. 



This animal, with considerable resemblance to a toad, is nevertheless a perfect 

 frog. It wants the vomerine teeth which are always found in the genus Rana. 

 Whether the fact of its wanting the small and imperfect vomerine teeth should 

 make us consider the Telmatobius as distinct from Rana, is a Question 1 shall 

 not take upon me here to decide ; it is enough to say, that the present eagerness 

 for the erection of new genera is fast degrading Natural Science into a system 

 of empirical uncertainty. Of its mode of life I know nothing; it was found on a 

 road bordered on each side by a deep ditch. Mr. Cate^by, who has an excellent 

 figure of it, calls it the land frog.

Body above more or less papillous, some of the papillae joined together so as 

 to form narrow oblong abbreviated lines. Chin and throat smooth, abdomen 

 and inner and hind part of the thighs, cancellately reticulate. The color above 

 is dark brown, brownish dusky, reddish brown, cinereous or dull green with 

 sometimes some very indistict spots of darker or of dusky. The triangular spot 

 on the vertex is often evanescent as is likewise the vertebral line of paler, or 

 green or reddish. The white line bounding the black spot from the orbits is 

 frequently wanting as is also the spot itself, as well as the one from the arm 

 along the side. Upper lip with sometimes three white perpendicular bars. 

 Throat and breast often varied with dusky. Tympanum rather indistinct. In 

 one specimen the color was brown with a golden gloss. 



Length 1-4, head "45, arm J 8, leg 2'8 in., thigh *75, tibia -85, foot 1*2 in. 



Found in immense numbers in every piece of water in the Southern States,

Body above with small warts of different forms and irregular disposition, 

 which are frequently of a yellowish brown color. Color above obscure green or 

 olivaceous, dotted all over with extremely minute points of black, a short oblong 

 and oblique dark brown or black spot, often with a white line below it, proceeds 

 from the orbit to the insertion of the arm, another of the same oblong form and 

 oblique direction formed from the juxtaposition of very small specks of black, 

 runs from near the axilla half way down the side, and a third one farther behind 

 reaches almost to the groin, all these however vary in form, and the third one is 

 frequently evanescent. Lips generally whitish spotted with black, chin and 

 throat granulate sometimes yellow, most frequently white and often speckled with 

 dusky, top of the nose with transverse wrinkles, tympanum small and indistinct, 

 of the color of the body. Body beneath white, with a fold on the breast betv< een 

 the arms. Abdomen rugoso-granulate, punctate. Legs beneath grey, thighs 

 on the under and hinder parts granulate with white, one of the granules on each 

 side of the anus larger and very conspicuous, above these is an angular darker

spot. Arms and legs barred or spotted with darker or dusky, thighs with one 

 or two darker spots, tibia a little varied in the same manner. Very much resem- 

 bles the preceding but the head is shorter and blunter, the body likewise is not as 

 slender or as graceful in form as in A. gryllus, having a considerable resem- 

 blance to a toad. Varies extremely in color and in other marks. The only un- 

 varying marks which I have been able to discover are the warts on the back, the 

 dusky line from the axilla on the side (which sometimes almost vanishes) the 

 darker angular spot above the anus (which at times is scarcely perceptible) and 

 the while granules on the hinder and under parts of the thighs. They are found 

 of a green color with a reddish line along the middle of the back, and olivaceous 

 with a red or green vertebral line, in the majority of specimens however this 

 line is entirely wanting. In some the warts on the back are few in number, and 

 the lower ones on each side coalesce into a line resembling a cutaneous fold. In 

 others a few dark spots of greater or less size are seen on the back, and there is 

 on the head a large triangular spot of dusky, the base of which is placed be- 

 tween the orbits, the apex pointing backwards often to be only traced by three 

 narrow lines forming a triangle frequently reduced to one transverse bar, and 

 again being sometimes entirely wanting. Theie are likewise in some a few 

 large oblong spots of cinereous dusky ou the back, which are so placed as to 

 form a recurved vitta on each side of the vertebral column, they are however 

 sometimes not joined together and then may be said to be scattered irregularly. 

 The upper lip is sometimes white varied with black, sometimes entirely white, 

 of which c dor is also the lower lip, almost always dotted with black. The black 

 spot from the orbit to the arm is often wanting and its place occupied by the 

 enlarged inferior white line. In many individuals the spot from the axilla is the 

 only one visible on the side. The fingers in all are slightly bullated at the ex- 

 tremity, which gives it the faculty of supporting itself on smooth perpendicular 

 surfaces. 



Whether all the variations above mentioned are permanent in the individuals 

 where they have been observed, or depend upon the will of the animal, I have 

 not been able to determine precisely. In many instances however, they are the 

 voluntary changes which for some unknown reasons this creature chooses to 

 make in its appearance.

Body elongated rather narrow, above with numerous small warts. Color 

 above dark slate, with more or less of oblong, oval or round sometimes very 

 numerous black spots, which often form stripes. Upper lip white, which color 

 often extends to the insertion of the arm. Irids golden. Tympanum distinct, 

 black or of the color of the body. A broad black band extends from the nose 

 through the eyes and along the sides to beyond the middle of the body. Beneath 

 whitish, sometimes tinged with yellow with a few black spots irregularly assem- 

 bled in groups, cancellately reticulate (in dead specimens appearing granulate) 

 arms and legs spotted and barred with black ; thighs and tibiae granulated, more 

 or less covered with small warts. A very slight scarcely perceptible web between 

 the second and third and between the third and fourth toes, the fourth and fifih 

 are closely united at the base. Fingers and toes with small dilations at then 

 tips. Chin often dusky. 



Inhabits Georgia and S. Carolina in ditches and ponds. 



This species has been placed by Dr. Holbrook in the genus Cystignathus, to 

 which it cannot possi ly be referred, as it has the vocal vesicle under' the chin 

 and not at the corners of the mouth. M. Dumeril has called it an Acris. Thai 

 genus has the toes properly and strongly webbed.

C. ornatus. Cystignathus ornatus Holbrook 1. c. pi. 25. 



Body short and broad. Above smooth, pale brown or dove or slate color, 

 with numerous specks of black. Lips whitish, yellowish or flesh color. Irids 

 golden. Tympanum small, black, distinct. Top of the head with a large, ir- 

 regular, triangular, dusky spot, the base of which lies between the eyes, and the 

 apex points backward, this with a long stripe of the same color on each side of 

 the vertebral column is sometimes very distinct, at others not visible. A black 

 vitta extends from the point of the nose through the eye and tympanum to near 

 the insertion of the arm, ana is sometimes continued on until it joins another 

 which runs along the sides to the middle of the body ; there are one or two 

 spots of the same color towards the hind part of the body, frequently however 

 wanting ; when present all these black maiks are bordered by yellow or white. 

 Beneath except on the throat cancellately reticulate, white or yellowish with 

 numerous black specks assembled in irregular groups. Legs above with trans- 

 verse bands of darker or dusky, thighs behind granulate and often spotted with 

 yellow ; there is generally a black spot on the outer part of the shoulder. The 

 tongue in this species is much rounder than in the preceding, it is also more 

 slightly emarginate and less narrowed at the base. 



Length 1.3 in., leg 1.8, tibia and foot 1.2. 



Inhabits Georgia, very common in the pine barren ponds. 



HYLA.

Body very broad and blunt, above covered with small warts ; beneath every 

 where granulate, the granules on the throat and chin are so Email, that these 

 parts appear almost smooth, tibia beneath reticulate. The color above varies at 

 will from pale brown to different shades of ash and to green, with a few irre- 

 gular spots or blotches, variable both in color and in form, which at times are 

 so arranged as to assume the appearance of an oblique angled cross ; there are 

 also numerous specks of black on different parts of the body. Beneath the 

 color is white, the inner and hinder sides of the thighs are of a deep yellow or 

 orange color, the under side with that of the tibia deep flesh color, both of them 

 reticulate with black. 



Inhabits from New York to the lower and warmer parts of Georgia, where 

 however it is very rare. 



This animal is the analogue of the Hyla arborea of Europe.

Body rather narrow and elongated. Varies in being above of various shades 

 of green sometimes nearly black, the green color however being by far the most 

 common, the other marks are constant. The line on the sides is either yellow 

 or silvery. In the spring it is found in rice-fields in astonishing quantities. Is 

 commonly known by the name of the bell-frog, its notes resembling the sound 

 of small bells. It is frequently called the fried bacon frog, as its voice seems to 

 some ears to repeat those words. Laurenti considers it as a variety of Hyla arborea 

 which he calls viridis, although it had borne the former name for many years 

 before he wrote his synopsis. Our American animal has but little resemblance 

 to the European, especially in form.

The darker marks on the head and back are sometimes evanescent, but the 

 yellow spots on the hind part of the thighs are always more or less distinctly 

 visible. The chin is cancellately reticulate, sometimes speckled with dusky 

 sometimes altogether of that color. The color of the body above varies at the 

 will of the animal. 




1855.] 429 



It is wrong in Dumeril and Bibron to say that this species is a variety of H. 

 squirella. In shape and size the difference is most considerable. The latter 

 animal during the warm season is always to be met with about houses, the H. 

 femoralis never. Besides, their notes are entirely different.

Color varying at the will of the animal from green to brown of different 

 degrees of intensity, spotted and speckled irregularly with darker or dusky and 

 sometimes with paler, often however of a uniform color. A darker line extends 

 from the nostrils to the eyes and through them to the insertion of the arm (this 

 is sometimes evanescent) ; beneath this darker line extends a white one which 

 reaches nearly to the groin ; sometimes interrupted or broken into three or four 

 parts. The dark line on the vertex between the eyes never fails entirely, al- 

 though it is sometimes reduced to a rather large spot on each eyelid. Toes not 

 so much palmate as in the preceding species.

 The exterior portion of the thighs and the whole of the under side of the arms 

 and legs i3 yellow, the legs also are not barred, but varied and speckled with 

 darker, chin and throat smooth. Toes as in the preceding species. 



Inhabits Georgia. In the spring it is found very numerous under the bark of 

 dead trees. 



H. pickeringii. Hylodes Pickeringi Holbrook, 1. c. pi. 34. 



Above smooth, light-brown or fawn-color with lines and spots or specks of 

 dusky, the first of these most frequently arranged so as to form an oblique angled 

 cross, a line of the same color on the top of the head forming an angle pointing 

 backwards, and another extending from the nose to the insertion of the arm, 

 this last sometimes not apparent, indeed all the dusky marks are frequently so 

 indistinct as to be scarcely observable, beneath whitish granulate, arms and legs 

 marked with transverse bars of darker or dusky. 



This is a true Hyla and wot an Hylodes : it is never found in the water, but on 

 the leaves of plants and under the bark of dead trees. 



H. ocularis. H. ocularis Daudin, 1. c. p. 32. Hylodes ocularis Holbrook,

Above brown or bronzed or silvery grey, very finely speckled with dusky or

 middle or beyond the middle of the sides, this is bordered beneath with white. 

 Chin and under side of the thighs speckled with black. Legs speckled like the 

 back and more or less spotted and barred with dusky, fingers and toes all fur- 

 nished with small disks. 



Length .6. 

 ^Inhabits Georgia. The smallest of all known Ranina. From the small size 

 of this and the preceding species, the web between the third and fourth toes is 

 not very perceptible. 



SCAPHIOPUS Holbrook. 



S. solitarius Holbrook, iv. pi. 27. 



Above olive brown, dusky, of various shades, with blotches of darker or black, 

 and two lines of pale yellow or whitish from the orbits to the vent, and some- 

 times another of the same color on the sides ; tympanum small, pale olive. Back 

 warty, the warts of different sizes and colors, some of them dark brown or 

 dusky, others orange colored or red. 



This curious animal so much resembling a frog in its maxillary and palatine 

 teeth, and a toad in its pnrotids, the form of its body and its subterranean life, 

 gives a fair example of some of our systematic arrangements. It has been 

 placed by M. Dumeril among the frogs, when to all intents and purposes it is 




430 [December, 



as much a toad as any of the genus Bufo. The flat spur, as it has been 

 called, at the root of the first toe on the internal margin of the metatarsus, is 

 nothing more than a much developed form of a scale or disk occupying the same 

 situation in most animals of this family. 



Although very seldom seen except when accidentally turned up by the spade 

 or the plough, yet the Scaphiopus is a very common animal in Georgia. When- 

 ever the South East storms occur at the Autumnal Equinox, the surface of the 

 earth is covered with them, and their dismal croakings add to the horror of the 

 howling winds and the deluges of water which pour down from the heavens. 



They have also been found in Connecticut and Massachusetts. When placed 

 upon the ground they dig with remarkable celerity, and soon entirely bury 

 themselves in the earth. 



BUFO. 



B. musicus Daudin 1. c. p. 92, pi 32. B. lentiginosis Holbrook v. pi. i. 



This species like all its congeners varies very much in color and in the form 

 and disposition of the spots. This variation depends entirely on the will of the 

 animal. It is generally however of a very dark dusky, sometimes light grey 

 and even reddish. I cannot conceive how it has ever received the name oilen- 

 tiginosus, which as I have shown before under Telmatobius is as unlike this 

 animal as any species can be. The Rana lentiginosa of Shaw, of which he 

 gives in his general Zoology a tolerably good figure, although copied from Cates- 

 by, is perfectly smooth, more resembling a frog than a toad, and therefore well 

 called by him the land frog ; whereas the B. musicus is very rough and makes 

 no approach to a frog in its form and habits. It walks rather than hops. Bar- 

 tram's red toad of Florida was a mere variation of this species, the difference 

 being nothing more than an accidental or voluntary change of color. 



The species figured under the name of Bufo cognatus of Say, in the explora- 

 tion of the Red River of Louisiana by R. B. Marcy, Capt. U. S. A. appears 

 to be this animal. 



B. americanus L. C 1. c. Holbrook 1. c. pi. 4. 



This species like the preceding varies very much in [color; it rather hops 

 than walks. 



B. erythronotus Holbrook, I. c v. pi. 2. 



Not having been able for years to obtain a living specimen of this animal I 

 shall say nothing more of it than that it bears not the sliuhtest resemblance to the 

 Bufo lentiginosus (B. musicus) as stated by Mr. Girard in Proceed. A. N. S. vol. 

 p. 86. 



B. qtjercicus Holbrook, 1. c. v. pi. 3. 



Above thickly covered with small warts,, dusky with a few irregular black 

 spots, many of the warts particularly those on the sides whitish or reddish; a 

 very distinct line of one of these colors runs from the point of the nose along the 

 vertebral column to the vent. Beneath the body is granulate, white, more or 

 less varied particularly on the fore part with black. There is a supraorbital 

 ridge straight and very distinct ; upper jaw slightly emarginate. Thumb equal 

 in length to the first finger, feet with two calli, the interior one exactly resem- 

 bling a toe and equal in length to the first toe. 



Length 1. 1, arm *6, leg I inch. 



Very common in Georgia in wet places, under logs and pieces of wood. 



ENGYSTOMA Fitzinger. 



E. cyrolinense. Microps Wagler, Stenocephalus Tschudi. 



Varying at will very much in color, from dusky to brown, olive-cinereous or 

 yellow cinereous, more or less varied, spotted or speckled with black, beneath 

 pale brownish white, punctate so as to appear spotted. 



Very common in the low country of Georgia under logs. In De Terville's 

 Natural History, Bosc confounds this animal with Daudin's Bufo gibbosus. He 




1855.] 431 



says he found it in South Carolina, but brought none thence to France, as the skin 

 was so thin and tender, that he was unable to preserve or even describe it : to 

 me the skin appears as strong as that of any other species of Ranina of the same 

 size. 



These are all the species of this family of reptiles which I have been able to 

 see in a living state. I hold it to be impossible for any one to make a correct 

 description of an animal which has the power of changing its color at will, un- 

 less he has it alive ; and this power they all possess in a greater or less degree ; 

 when preserved in alcohol they always fade. The difficulty of procuring de- 

 scriptions made on the spot where the objects are found, has rendered this part 

 of natural history as confused and unsatisfactory, as the researches of bota- 

 nists who draw up their accounts of plants from dried specimens. 



There are a few species with which I was formerly acquainted but which I 

 have not met with or been able to obtain. Among these are a frog which seemed 

 intermediate between R. pipiens and R. palustiis, two Hylae inhabiting Georgia, 

 and another probably an Acris which I formerly described in the Annals of the 

 Lyceum of New York under the name R. pumila. Mr. Baird describes some 

 in the Proceedings of our Society, which have been sent to him from Texas, 

 Mexico, and other remote parts of our country. These I do not here treat of, 

 being certain that I shall never see them in a living state. There is in the 

 waters of ponds and ditches a small frog whose note exactly resembles the bleat- 

 ing of a lamb, so truly as to deceive any one. This animal I have seen, but 

 never succeeded in catching it. It is very common in Georgia and I have 

 heard it as far north as Norfolk in Virginia. It is left to the inhabitants of those 

 parts of our country to determine what it is. 



Observations on the North American species of Bats. 



By John Le Conte. 



Notwithstanding all that has been written by Rafinesque, F. Cuvier and Dr. 

 Bachman on the bats of North America, a diligent study has shown me consid- 

 erable errors in the accounts of all. Before proceeding to a description of these 

 animals, it is necessary to remark, that every bat which I have seen, has an uncer- 

 tain numberof transverse wrinkles or plaits on the outer portion of the ear, and has 

 the toes furnished with rather long and fine hairs, as it were fimbriated, wherefore 

 these two marks are omitted as furnishing no good specific characters. All our bats 

 except the Molossus belong to the same genus ; the trifling difference in the 

 number of the teeth does not afford a sufficient reason for considering them as 

 different. M. F. Cuvier in the first volume of the Nouv. Annales du Museum, 

 divides the genus into three sections, the Serotinoids, the Noctuloids and the 

 Murinoid?. The form of the cranium seems to be the chief mark in distin- 

 guishing them from each other. The Serotinoids may be described as having 

 the cranium somewhat inflated and rounded, the jaws short, widened and ele- 

 vated at the extremity, the facial angle 43. The European species as far as I 

 can collect, have four upper incisors. In this country we have but two belong- 

 ing to this section, the Noveboracensis and the cinereus, both of which have but 

 two upper fore teeth. The Noctuloids have the skull rather straight and flat on 

 the top, and the jaws more extended, the facial angle is 30. They all have 

 four upper incisors except the crepuscularis which has like those of the first di- 

 vision but two. The Murinoids are known by having the cranium inflated and 

 rounded, the jaw3 elongated a little raised in front with a considerable depres- 

 sion separating them from the cranium, the facial angle is 22. The V. pallidus 

 which has buc two upper fore teeth appears to me to be a Murinoid ; all the 

 rest have four upper fore teeth. As for what has been called a Plecotus (even 

 by myself) it certainly belongs to this division : it differs considerably from 

 the Plecotus auritus of Europe, in the form and position of the ears. I am not 

 writing about the animals of a foreign country, and therefore I say no more on 



u 




432 [December, 



this head, than that the P. aurilu3 as far as regards the skull appears to be a Seroti- 

 noid. My remarks on the Molossus will appear when I come to describe that 

 species.

 V. monachus and tessellatus Rafinesque. Nycticeius Atalapha and Atalapha 

 americana ejusd. Taphyzous rufus Lesson. It likewise belongs according to 

 Leach to his genus Scotophilus, Taphizous rufus. Harlan's description is made 

 from an infamous figure in Wilson's Ornithology. 



Dentition. Upper Jaw, incisors l-l simple, distant. Canines 1-1, hollowed 

 out behind with a perpendicular septum dividing the concavity for its whole 

 length False molars 1-1, concave on the outer and inner surfaces, the calca- 

 neum produced behind into a lobe. Molars 3-3, the first and second with six 

 cusps, three exterior, small apparently formed from the basal ridge which sur- 

 rounds the teeth ; two intermediate and one exterior ; the third with three cusps 

 ranged transversely and one posterior. 



Lower Jaw. Incisors six, biemarginate. Canines 1-1. False molars 2-2, the 

 anterior one very small. Molars 3-3, with five cusps, two exterior and three 

 interior, the basal ridge wanting interiorly. 



A young one taken from the mother's breast, had in the upper jaw, the inci- 

 sors, the canines, and the false molars; in the lower jaw, the canines and 

 one false molar on each side, all of them hooked like the claws of the toes. 



Face black, hairy ; nose blunt, emarginate. Ears brown, short, round, almost 

 concealed in the fur, a little hairy, orillon cultriform, blunt, one half the length of 

 the ear, and sparely hairy. Membrane dusky, generally reddish brown along 

 the antibrachium, and more or less so along the great part of the length 

 of the fingers ; a portion of the base on each side is hairy, so as to form a straight 

 line from the shoulder to the foot ; spot at the base of the thumb white, a few 

 hairs of the same color or of rufous extend down the fourth finger: beneath 

 from the body to the end of the os humeri it is thickly covered with rather long 

 hair, along the fore arm more sparsely so, for nearly one half the w r idth 

 of ihe wing. The interfemoral membrane includes the whole of the tail, 

 on the upper surface it is densely hairy, the hair being of the general color 

 of the body, sometimes tipped with white, never cinereous at the base ; on the 

 under surface it is naked except at the base, where there is an oblong patch of 

 hair extending along the tail, for one third of its length. Feet black, thickly 

 covered with hair. 



Color extremely various, scarcely any two being found exactly alike. A very 

 common variety has the hair above four-colored, that is to say, black or dark 

 cinereous at the base, then yellowish brown or fawn-colored, afterwards dark ru- 

 fous or reddish brown, or orange-tawny or purplish brown, finally very slightly 

 tipped with white, very often with a distinct ring of a darker shade around the 

 neck. Beneath, the hair is three colored, the base dark or light cinereous, then 

 one of the other colors, and tipped with white, so that the pelage is varied 

 with cinereous and the other colors, and powdered over with white : this last 

 color forms a conspicuous spot at the axilla. The pelage is however above 

 sometimes only three-colored, being as before dark cinereous at the base, then 

 pale yellowish, and afterwards bright light rufous or orange without any white 

 tips or very few of them, so as to appear uniformly rufous or orange, be- 

 neath rather paler. The lighter the color above, the more does the membrane 

 incline to reddish brown. They have been found of a uniform cream color, and 

 even white, the base of the hair being always cinereous, but are most com- 

 monly of different shades of rufous or tawny. The darker the ground the 

 more apt are the hairs to have white tips, although some of dark shades have 

 been found without any of these. 



Length 2 in. Tail 1.6. Extent 11.3. Head -7. Ears -25. Orillon -1. 



This, the commonest species in the United States, is found everywhere from 

 Canada to Florida, from one end of the country to the other equally numerous. 

 It may even extend into South America, as the description by Lesson of the V. bo- 




1855.]

nariensis in the Zoology of the voyage of the Coquille agree? very well ; but the 

 figure of the animal which accompanies it is so wretchedly executed, as to be 

 of no use in determining the point. 



V. cinereus. Palisot de B(;auvois, 1. c. V. pruinosus Say, Long's Expe- 

 dition vol. i. p. 168. 



Dentition the same in every respect as in V. noveboracensis. Hair above 

 four-colored, that is to say, black at the base, then reddish-brown, afterwards 

 black, and tipped with white: beneath two-colored, the lower half dark cine- 

 reous, the upper yellowish or grey, so that the pelage of the animal appears on 

 the upper side, variegated with reddish brown and black, and powdered over 

 with white, this latter color so disposed as to form transverse curved and wa- 

 ving lines, on the under side, yellowish grey on the sides and cinereous mixed 

 with grey on the other parts. Head above and throat yellowish grey; face 

 hairy ; chin very dark brown : nose flat, blunt, emarginate. Ears black, sim- 

 ple round, densely covered both within and without on the anterior portion, with 

 short yellowish grey hair, leaving a distinct narrow, naked margin. Orillon 

 cultriform, blunt and sparsely hairy, half the length of the ear. Membrane 

 dusky, for one third its breadth along the arm brown ; sometimes beyond this 

 spotted with brown, very much so near the body. A portion next the body in 

 a straight line from the shoulder to the feet is hairy. There is generally a 

 small white hairy spot at the anterior joint of the humerus (sometimes how- 

 ever the hairs are pale brown, not white), and another at the base of the thumb. 

 The membrane beneath is hairy as far as the third finger for nearly half its 

 breadth, this hairy space joins another of the same width along the sides, and 

 there is generally a large white spot at the axilla or insertion of the humerus. In- 

 terfemoral including the whole of the tail, above densely hairy, beneath only 

 at the base, forming a roundish deeply emarginate patch, feet black, sparingly 

 hairy. 



Length 3 inches. Tail 2-1. Extent 16-8. Head -94. Ear -48. Orillor, .25. 



I have given to this species the name imposed upon it by Palisot de Beauvois, 

 ann. 1796 in the catalogue of Peale's Museum, although I am not certain that 

 it differs from the V. lasiurus of Linnaeus. This last is said by Temminck to 

 inhabit Cayenne and North America. The description of Temminck suits our 

 animal very well, but whether the two are the same, remains yet to be deter- 

 mined. The figure in Schreber is undoubtedly taken from a V. noveboracensis 

 The V. bonarien3is described and figured by Lesson in the Zoology of the voy- 

 age of the Coquille vol. i. p. 137 tab. 62, may be either the one or the other, 

 the figure is so excessively bad that nothing can be made of it. This is the 

 largest of all the bats found in the United States, it is not common, and is seen 

 more frequently in the middle than in the northern or southern states. 



I have never had it in my power to examine more than six or seven individ- 

 uals of this species, and therefore cannot say how far the colors may vary. 



V CREPCSCULARIS. 



Dentition the same as in the two former species. 



Hair black, above tipped with chestnut brown, beneath with paler or cinereous 

 brown more or less distinctly varied by the black of the lower part of the hair. 

 Head rather depressed, face flat, black, naked, with a few scattered, long, coarse 

 hairs, and a small wart over each eye ; nose broad, flat, blunt, emarginate ; chin 

 with a small double wart on the lower part. Ears shorter than the head, tri- 

 angularly ovate, rounded at the point, slightly emarginate on the hinder edge, 

 dusky, naked. Orillon short, dolabriform, blunt. Membrane very thin, dusky, 

 naked except a narrow space next the body. Interfemoral including the tail 

 except the two last joints naked, except a small portion of the base which both 

 above and beneath is slightly bjairy. 



Length 2-2. Tail 1-4, naked part -15. Extent 10-5. Head *7. Ears -3. Oril- 

 lon -19. 



Inhabits Georgia. 



This is the V. creeks of F. Cuvier, this name however being unmeaning and 




434 [December 



indeed ridiculous, I have substituted for it the name given to it by me many 

 years ago and mentioned in Dr. McMurtrie's translatioa of the Regne Anunale. 



All the species of American Bats described by the illustrious French Natural- 

 ist in Xouv. Annales du Museum vol. i. p. 1 were given by me to his brother the 

 Baron, aud I distinctly remember this species as having been among them.

Hair long dark plumbeous, above tipped with dark chestnut brown, beneath 

 with paler or greyish or yellowish cinereous. Face black, naked with a few coarse 

 hairs. Nose flat, blunt, emarginate, rugou3. Ears short, black, naked except 

 for about one fourth their length from the base on the outer side, emarginate be- 

 hind almost from the tip to the basal lobe. Orillon lanceolate, blunt, rounded 

 at the tip, a very little curved on the posterior edge, straight on the anterior. 

 Membrane black, uaked, except near the body, Interfemoral naked except a few 

 scattered hairs near the body ; including the tail, of which the last joint projects 

 beyond it. 



Length 3-8. Tail 1-5, naked part -1. Extent 11-7. Head -75. Ears -45. Orillon -2. 



Inhabits from New York to Florida. 



This with the four preceding are very nearly related to each other, so much 

 so as to be easily taken the one for the other ; we therefore find thtm all called 

 V. arcuatusof Say or V. caroliniensis of Geoff. St Hilaire, these two being con- 

 sidered identical. They however differ in the shape of the ear and in the oril- 

 lon. These two parts alone I have found in all species of Vespertilionidae to 

 afford unvarying characteristics. 



The fuscas has the ear somewhat triangular, very concave on the outer edge 

 and emarginate near the tip, the orillon acinaciform. 



The carolinensis has the ear hairy for oue half its length, ovate and emarginate 

 on the hinder edge, the orillon is lanceolate and blunt. 



The ursinus, ear oval, eutire ; that is to say not at all emarginate, the orillon 

 acinaciform and obtuse. 



The phaiops, ear somewhat triangular, sinuous or bi-emarginate on the outer 

 edge, orillon oblong, blunt. 



The caroli has the ears ovate, emarginate behind almost from the tip to the 

 base, and the orillon lanceolate, blunt, rounded at the point; a little curved on 

 posterior edge. 



V. pulverulentus Tern. ii. p. 235. V. Audubonii Harlan, Med. & Phys. Re- 

 searches, p. 90. V. noctevagans L. C. olim. 



Dentition the same as in the five preceding species, except that the false molars 

 in the upper jaw are 2-2. the anterior one frequently pressed inward by the pos- 

 terior one ; and in the lower jaw the false molars are 3-3. 



Hair black or very dark brown, generally tipped with white or pale brown, or 

 brownish grey in rather a scattering maDner. Face somewhat hairy, nose blunt 

 emarginate; fore part of the throat with a large wart. Ears moderate, ovate, 

 blunt, the lower half covered with hair, granulate within the outer edge which 

 is somewhat revolute and entire, anterior part of the helix highly developed, 

 prominent and straight, forming a winged appendage near the head. Orillon 

 short, cubiform, blunt, membrane naked black or dusky, interfemoral including 

 the tail, except the last and one half of the penultimate joint, thinly covered for 

 one half its length with long fine hairs like those of the body tipped very slightly 

 with greyish, the under side is furnished with distant hairs disposed in lines. 



Inhabits from New York to Georgia. 



This species has the head of a Noctuloid and the teeth differing from all the 

 others. Is sometimes found entirely black. 



V. subulatus Say. Long's Expedition, vol. ii. p. 65. 



Dentition. Upper jaw, incisors 2-2 distant by pairs, the anterior larger and 

 emarginate, false molars 3-3 anterior one small, intermediate one minute and 

 the posterior large. Molars as in all the preceding species. The teeth in the 

 lower jaw are also the same except that there are 3 false molars on each side, 

 the two anterior of which are not half the length of the posterior.

Hair aoove black, tipped with very dark chesnut brown or with dark fawn 

 color, beneath dark cinereous tipped with brownish grey. Face black, hairy, 

 nose blunt, slightly emarginate. Ears black, moderate, very slightly hairy at the 

 base, ovate, emarginate on the posterior edge. Orillon subulate, pointed. Mem- 

 brane naked dusky or dark brown, a little hairy next the body, the humeral por- 

 tion extending beyond the bone into an angle. Interfemoral hairy near the base 

 for about one-third its length both above and beneath, including the tail except 

 the last joint and one half of the penultimate. 



Length 2.9. Tail 1.1. Naked part .1. Extent 9.4. Head. 9. Ears .4. Orillon .3. 



Inhabits everywhere. Varies much in color from the darkest chesnut to light 

 fawn. With this species, commences the family of Murinoid bats. 



V. lucifugus L. C. in Dr. McMurtrie's translation of the Regne Animal. 



Dentition the same as in V. subulatus. 



Hair dark plumbeous, above tipt with dark chestnut brown, beneath with pale 

 brown. Face black, hairy, nose flat, blunt, rugose, emarginate. Ears black, 

 naked, except about one fourth their length outwardly from the base, so much 

 emarginate outwardly as to appear hooked. Orillon lanceolate, blunt, a little 

 convex on the outer edge, straight on the inner. Membrane black, naked except 

 near the body. Interfemoral naked, except a few scattered bairs on the under 

 surface, including the tail except the last joint. 



Length 3.8. Tail 1.6. Naked part .1. Extent 11.7. Head .75. Ears .45. Orillon 

 .2. 



Inhabits Georgia. 



Much resembles the preceding but has the ears of a different form as well as 

 the orillon. 



V. georgianus Cuvier 1. c. p. 16. 



Dentition the same as in subulatus except that the posterior false molar of the 

 upper jaw has an interior, basal, bi-emarginate cusp formed from a prolongation 

 of the calcaneum of the tooth, and the canine of the lower jaw has an interior, 

 blunt, basal lobe. 



Hair dark plumbeous, above tipped with bright rufous, the hair so arranged 

 that the pelage appears varied with black particularly on the upper part of the 

 back, beneath the hair is tipped with fawn color or rufous. Face black, very 

 hairy, nose flat, blunt, rugose, emarginate. Ears perfectly naked, short, ovate, 

 blunt, slightly emarginate on the outer edge, orillon oblong," blunt, straight. 

 Membrane dusky or very dark brown slightly hairy next the body. Interfemoral 

 above thinly furnished with rather long hairs for nearly one half its length, 

 beneath with a few scattering hairs which spring from the transverse nervures, 

 including the tail, except the last joint and one half of the penultimate. 



Length 3 in. Tail 1.6. Naked part .1. Extent .9 in. Head .55. Ears .35. Orillon

Said by Dr. Bachman to be same with the V. subulatus which it very slightly 

 resembles. 



V. macrotis. Plecotus macrotis L. C. McMurtrie's translation of Cuvier's 

 Regne Animal, Appendix. 



Dentition. Upper jaw incisors 2-2, the anterior bilobed, the posterior smaller. 

 False molars 2-2, the anterior one very small, the base of the posterior one pro- 

 jecting backwards into a fiat, sharp surface. Molars and canines as before. 

 Lower jaw, incisors 6, crenate. False molars 3-3, the two anterior small. Molars 

 and canines as in other species. 



Hair black above slightly tipped with dark chesnut brown, beneath with 

 whitish, sometimes entirely black both above and beneath, except a small cinere- 

 ous space near the arms. Face black nakedish, with a prominent tubercle on 

 each side behind the nostrils, these tubercles converge towards each other, 

 leaving a considerable hollow space on the top of the head, which is flat, 

 the nose not bilobed. Ears ovate broad, naked, dusky, much longer than the 

 head, bending forwards, the hinder margin somewhat involute, the inner margin

near the base hairy. Orillon long, subulate, broad at the base a little convex on 

 the inner side. Membrane naked dusky, interfemoral including the tail except 

 the last joint. 



Length 2.1. Tail .2. Naked part .1. Extent 10 in. Head .75. Ear 1.05. Orillon 

 .25. 



Inhabits Georgia. 



This species though at first sight very much resembling the so called Plecotus 

 auritus of Europe, differs from it particularly, in having the ears perfectly 

 separated at the base, and wants the small lobe or blunt tooth on their inner 

 edge. The cranium is entirely that of a Murinoid bat, and the teeth of the two 

 species agree. 



V. PALLIDUS. 



Dentition. Incisors 1-1, large simple. Canines 1-1, a little concave on the 

 outer side, with an internal, basal, rather blunt cusp. False molars 1-1. Molars 

 first and second as in all the others, the third with fout cusps, three of them 

 transverse, the interior one smaller, and one posterior. 



Lower jaw incisors .4. False molars 2-2, the anterior one smaller, rather 

 interior. First and second molars as in others, the third with three cusps, not 

 transverse, the interior one larger and transversely deeply emarginate. 



Hair light fawn-colored, tipped with darker, beneath paler. Face hairy dark 

 brown. Nose rounded, emarginate. Ears longer than the head, oval, entire, 

 very pale dusky brown. Orillon nearly one half the length of the ear, linear, 

 blunt. Membrane thin naked brown. Interfemoral including the tail except 

 the two last joints. 



Length 3. Tail 1.5. Naked part .1. Extent 12.1. Head .9. Ears .95. Orillon .4. 



Inhabits California. 



Differs from all the other species in having but 4 lower incisors ; I hesitate 

 therefore to arrange it with the Serinoid or Murinoid Bats and place it at ihe 

 end of these two families.

Dentition. Upper jaw, incisors 1-1, simple, distant, convergent at the points so 

 as almost to meet. Canines 1-1 curved outwards, so deeply grooved in front ai 

 to appear almost double. False molars 2-2 the anterior one very small, the 

 posterior one with a sharp basal cusp. Molars 3-3, the first and second with 

 seven cusps 3 exterior, 2 intermediate and 2 interior, the third with five cusps 2

 the anterior one smaller. Molars 33 each with 2 exterior and 3 interior cusps. 



Hair fine and soft, cinereous tipped with brownish dusky, beneath rather paler. 

 Face naked, nose turned up, broad, blunt, channeled on the top, crenately serrate 

 on the front margin, upper lip very large, tumid, pendulous, with eight perpen- 

 dicular grooves. Ears projected forwards, broad, rounded, not united on the 

 top of the head, but running down the sides of the forehead to the root of the 

 nose, outwardly produced downwards and forwards to the corner of the mouth, 

 and very obtusely emarginate about one third of the distance from the top, the 

 upper part has inwardly from eight to ten small rather pointed tubercles near its 

 margin. The ears have likewise an internal fold and a small thick round fleshy 

 lobe opposite the orillon and concealing it from view. Orillon small oblong 

 and rectangular; the lower part of the outer edge of the ear is double as in 

 many other animals, for instance in cats and dogs. Membrane rather thicker 

 than common, naked, dusky, the interfemoral above more or less thinly covered 

 with short and soft hair, including the tail, one third part of which projects be- 

 yond it. The inner and outer toes wooly outside, the outer toe somewhat op- 

 posable to the others.

Inhabits Georgia and South Carolina. 




438 [December, 



It ia very remarkable what confusion exists in authors with regard to the 

 genus of this animal. It was called by Geof. St. Hilaire in 1805 Molossus, 

 afterwards in 1814 Nyctonomus, again was described by him as Rhinopoma 

 caroliniense ; it likewise belongs to the genus Dysopes of llliger and the Diuops 

 of Sari, yet none of their descriptions either of the genus or the species appear 

 to be correct ; they all seem to have confounded this North American bat with 

 the Melossus velox certainly an inhabitant of South America, and plainly be- 

 longing to a different genus. Mr. Cooper in the Annals of the Lyceum of New 

 York has made two species of it, Molossus cynocephalus and M. Lecontii. 

 founding the difference in the plaitings of the ears in the latter. As I have before 

 observed this is a character common to all bats : in dried specimens these strife 

 frequently are evanescent. 



M. Temminck's remark on the fore teeth of his Molossus that they vary in 

 number and are pushed out of place by the canines is a mere supposition. Age 

 of course causes the teeth to fall out, when the base of the canines will advance 

 somewhat, and cover the open alveoli, but in most cases, these always remain 

 open, or at most one or two of them may close as is observable in other animals 

 that have the misfortune to lose one or more of their teeth. In the M. velox 

 which has but four incisives in the lower jaw, placed in front at the base of the 

 canines, he supposes them to have been once situated in a space between the 

 canines, and afterwards to be pushed out in front (without any presumable 

 function) of their almost united bases ; an impossibility. This position of the 

 lower fore teeth is to be seen in every age of the animal. 



I have observed fifteen individuals of this species : one had no incisors in 

 the lower jaw; two had five ; three had four, and the rest six. 



This Bat is so numerous in the cities of the South as sometimes to render 

 houses uninhabitable, by their disagreeable smell, and the noise which they 

 make in moving about. It appears to be equally common in the island of 

 Cuba. 



Of Bats described by others, the following with but one exception I have never 

 Been, Dr. Bachman in the viii. volume of the Journal of this Society, mentions 

 four species : V. monticola he says resembles Say's bat; what species he calls by 

 that name I cannot discover. V. virginianus seems to be the V. humeralis of 

 Rafinesque. I have not seen this last for many years, and therefore cannot pro- 

 nounce definitely concerning it. The V. Leibii and Californicus are equally 

 unknown. Of Mr. Rafinesque's species, it is impossible to determine the follow- 

 ing ; there is a good reason however to doubt, whether they are distinct from 

 others which are well known ; V. cyanopterus, V. melanotis, V. calcaratus, 

 V. phaiops afterwards described in his Annals of Nature No. 1 as Eptisecus 

 melanops, V. megalotis, V. mystax afterwards called in the Journal de Physique 

 vol. lxxxviii. p. 417, Hypexodon mystax and Eptisecus melas, M. Cuvier's V. Sal- 

 arii may be the fuscus, and his subflavus the Caroliniensis ; his crassus like- 

 wise I cannot determine. M. Temminck's V. erythrodactylus, Temm. vol. ii. 

 page 235, remains among those unknown by me. 



Notices of some new and little known Birds in the collection of the JJ. S. Exploring 

 Expedition in the Vincennes and Peacock, and in the collection of the Academy of 

 Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. 



By John Cassin. 



1. Muscipbta cyaniceps, nobis. 



Form. Bill rather long, wide at base, abruptly compressed towards the end 

 and furnished with about six pairs of strong rigid bristles at the base, some of 

 which are as long as the bill. Feathers of the head above somewhat elongated 

 and probably erectile, wings rather long, fourth primary longest, tail long, wide, 

 central feathers but slightly exceeding others next to them, tarsi rather long, 

 slender, tees short, feeble. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin) about 6^ inches, wing 3, tail 3$ inches. 




1855.] 439 



Colors. Entire head and breast dull blue, every feather having a longitudinal 

 central line of a paler shade or light blue. Upper parts of the body, the abdomen 

 and several of the outer feathers of the tail fine rufous, palest on the abdomen, 

 quills dark brown, secondaries edged with rufous. Central feathers of the tail 

 dark brown, which is the color also of the inner webs of the feathers next to 

 them. Bill dark, tarsi lighter. 



Hab. Philippine Islands. Spec, in Coll. Ex. Exp. in Nut. Mus. Washington. 



Obs. This is a very handsome small species of this genus, and bears a re- 

 semblance to Muscicapa borbonica, Gm. Buff. PI. Enl. 573, fig. 1, which is an 

 inhabitant of the islands of Madagascar and Mauritius. From that species the 

 present birds may easily be distinguished by the pale longitudinal lines on the 

 blue parts of the plumage, in addition to which it is larger and has the tail dis- 

 proportionately longer. 



The only specimen that I have ever seen of this species is in the collection of 

 the Exploring Expedition, and is labelled as having been obtained at the Philip- 

 pine Islands. It belongs strictly to the same subgeneric group as M. borbonica, 

 and shows a general relationship to several other African species. It will be 

 figured in the forthcoming Atlas to my volume on the Birds of the Exploring 

 Expedition. 



2. Laniarius multicolor. G. R. Gray, Genera of Birds, i. p. 299, pi. 72. 

 Hab. Western Africa. Spec, in Mus. Acad. Philad. 



Obs. A single specimen of this handsome species is in the collection of the 

 Academy, and was obtained by Dr. MacDowell, on St. Paul's river, Western 

 Africa. 



3. Hyphantornis flayigula, Hartlaub, Rev. Zool. 1845, p. 406. 

 Hyphantornis Grayi. Verreaux, Rev. et Mag. de Zool. 1851, p. 514. 

 Hab. Gaboon country, River Moonda. Spec, in Mus. Acad. Philada. 

 According to Mr. DuChaillu, in whose collection are numerous specimens, the 



1 irds described as above are the two sexes of the same species. H. flavigula is 

 the female. 



In Mr. DuChaillu's notes now in my possession I find the following in relation 

 to this species : 



" This bird frequents the borders of the woods, or more frequently the tufted 

 bushes which are not found far from habitations. It is always in these thickets, 

 and if it were not for its cry, which indicates the place where it may be found, 

 it would be very difficult to procure it. It is always in company with its female, 

 and does not live in troops. Sometimes two pairs may be seen on the same tree. 

 This bird generally makes its nest in these very thick bushes and in the midst 

 of the leaves ; the two nests in my collection, I found within ten yards of a 

 house, and both contained eggs of a rose color." 



"This bird is found in the dry season and at the commencement of the rainy 

 season, when it disappears." 



4. Sycobius nigerrimus, (Yieill.) 

 Ploceus nigerrimus, Vieill. 



Hab. Gaboon country and River Moonda. Western Africa. 



Several specimens of this rare species, remarkable for the uniform deep black 

 of its plumage, are in the collection of the Academy. Some of them were col- 

 lected by Mr. DuChaillu on the River Moonda, and others have recently been 

 obtained in a collection from the Gaboon country, obtained in New York by Mr. 

 John G. Bell. 



5. Symplectes princeps. Bonap. Consp. Av. p. 107. 

 Hab. Lagos, Western Africa. 



A specimen of this bird is in an interesting collection made by John L. Burt, 

 M. D., of the U. S. Navy, at Lagos, and recently presented to the Academy.

The specimens in the collection of the Academy were brought by Dr. Town- 

 send from the Sandwish Islands, and in the collection of the Expedition in the 

 Vincennes and Peacock are numerous specimens which appear to represent both 

 sexes. The female much resembles the male, but is smaller and with the co- 

 lors duller, with tinges of brown on the throat and occasionally on the upper 

 parts of the body. Both sexes have the tail long. 



At present, I regard the bird figured by Reichenbach in " Die Volstandigste 

 Naturgeschichte " Birds, pi. 604, fig. 4099, and described in " Handbuch der 

 speciellen Ornithologie," Scansorias p. 333, as a distinct species, though given 

 by that distinguished naturalist as the female of " Mohoa fasciculatus " (fig. 

 4098). It is as follows : 



9. Mohoa braccata, nobis. 



Smaller than the preceding, bill less curved, tail moderate, central feathers 

 longest. 



Tibiae yellow. Head above black, throat and breast with every feather having 

 a small terminal spot of ashy white, back, frump, and under parts dark chocolate 

 brown, with a few longitudinal lines of white on the back. Wings and tail 

 brownish black, the former edged with white at the shoulder. Bill and feet dark. 



Dimensions. Total length 8J inches, wing 3, tail 3J inches. 



Hab. Sandwich Islands. Spec, in Mus. Acad. Philada. 



The only specimen that I have ever seen of this species was brought by Dr. 

 Townsend from the Sandwich Islands and is marked as a male. It has heretofore 

 in the collection of the Academy been mistaken for Certhia pacifica Gmelin, 

 but is clearly not that bird and but little resembles it as far as can be de- 

 termined from the plate in Audebert, or from the descriptions by Gmelin and 

 Latham. In addition to these two there is a third species of this genus. 



10. Mohoa angustipluma, (Peale.) 



Entomiza angustipluma. Peale Zool. Exp. Vincennes, Birds p. 147 (1848.) 



Plumage of the head, neck and breast, with the webs of the feathers com- 

 posed of few filaments and presenting an open or skeleton like texture, many 

 feathers of the throat terminated with bristles. Bill curved, wings rather long, 

 tail long wedge shaped, legs and feet strong. Larger than either of the two pre- 

 ceding. 



Head and neck above dark brown, every feather having a longitudinal central 

 stripe of dull white, tinged with greenish yellow on the latter. Other upper 

 parts including wings and tail, brown, on the back with longitudinal stripes of 

 white, quills and tail feathers edged with olive green on their outer webs, rump 

 tinged with olive. Wide stripe from the base of the bill under the eye, ending 

 in a large spot on the cheek, black. 



Throat dull white tinged- with yellow, breast and aVdomen dull white, every 

 feather margined with dull brown, flanks and under tail coverts dark rufous, 

 bill and legs dark. 



Dimensions. Total length 13^ inches, wing 6, tail 6 J inches. 



Hab. Hawaii. Spec, in Nat. Mus. Washington. 



One of the most remarkable of the ornithological acquisitions of the Expedi- 

 tion in the Vincennes and Peacock, and clearly of this genus. The feathers of 

 the head and breast in this bird present a singular character on account of the 

 filaments composing the webs being unusually few, and at such a distance from 

 ei ch other as not to touch, nor become adherent. The specimen described may 




1855.] 441 



not be adult and its sex is not stated. It does not appear to be related to Stri- 

 giceps, Lesson. 



This species will be carefully figured in the Atlas to my volume on the Quad- 

 rupeds and Birds of the Exploring Expedition now nearly ready. 



Note on the Miocene and Post-Pliocene deposits of California, with descriptions of 



two new Fossil Corals. 



By T. A. Conrad. 



Post-Pliocene deposits of shells occur at various places on the coast of Cali- 

 fornia, as Santa Barbara, San Pedro, <fcc, but I have seen specimens of Miocene 

 fossils from no other locality on the coast than near the former town, where they 

 were obtained by Dr. Heermann, who informs me that they are very little elevated 

 above the sea, and that the Post-Pliocene fossils rest immediately upon them. 

 This Miocene deposit consists chiefly of fine loose brown sand and small corals, 

 the most of which are a species herein described as Idmonea Californica. The 

 shells have been described in the Proceedings for February, 1855, p. 267, and 

 consist of Mercenaria perlaminosa, Pecten Heermanni, Diadora crucibuliformis, 

 Pandora bilirata and Cardita occidentalis. 



The Mercenaria and Pecten are closely related to species of the "Virginia 

 Miocene, and indeed there is an extraordinary analogy in all the above mentioned 

 shells to species of the Atlantic Miocene deposits ; and what is equally remark- 

 able, they have no resemblance to the existing California species, many of which 

 are imbedded in sand above them; affording perhaps a stronger contrast between 

 the two groups than occurs in any other part of the world. The Atlantic 

 Miocene and Post-Pliocene on the contrary contain a few species in common and 

 others which are analogous. 



'O' 



IDMOXEA, Lamourouz. 



Idmonea Californica. Branches compressed, slender, bifurcated ; tubular open- 

 ings projecting, irregularly grouped, but disposed to form in transverse series ; 

 longitudinal line between the openings or cells, microscopic or obsolete ; reverse 

 surface plano-convex, tranversely wrinkled and slightly furrowed ; section exhi- 

 biting 15 to 20 angular pores. 



The branches of this species are about of an inch wide. I havo not seen 

 any among them anastomosed. It belongs to the genus Crisisina, D'Orbigny. 



Among these corallines, is a species of Tubulipora, a Retepora and a Lichenopora 

 which may be named 



Lichmopora Californica. Adhering ; tubular openings numerous, arranged in 

 irregular branching rays ; central depression rather deep and with numerous 

 unequal pores. Diameter about of an inch. 



Post-Pliocene. 



Near Santa Barbara and San Pedro, Dr. Heermann collected a number of fossil 

 shells of the same species which inhabit the adjacent coast, among which are 

 Platyodon cancellatum, Conrad, Schizothcerus JVuttallii, Con., Vinus Nuttallii, Con., 

 Tellina nasuta and Tapes diversa, Sowerby, among the bivalves, and a number of 

 univalves. 



.Description of a new species of Pentamerus. 

 By T. A. Conrad. 



Pentamerus laqueatus. Ovate ; larger valve inflated, with about 28 angular ribs ; 

 mesial ridge but little prominent, with 56 ribs rather larger than the others ; 

 smaller valve slightly ventricose with a wide but shallow depression on each 

 side ; basal margin sinuou3. 



Locality. Delphi, Indiana. Mr. Hill. This species resembles P. Aylesfordii, 

 but is quite distinct.

Description of two new species of Ilesperomys. 



By John Le Conte. 



Dr. Bachmao, ia Audubon's Quadrupeds of North America, states that the 

 Hesperoinys leucopus inhabits the southern regions of our country. Although 

 I have resided in the lower part of Georgia for a great portion of my life, I never 

 saw it there. There are however two species which he seems to consider the 

 same, and which he has confounded with the northern animal. An accurate 

 and detailed description of these will show very distinctly how much they differ. 

 These two species are the gossypinus and the cognatus. The first was described 

 by me in the Proceedings of the Academy, vol. vi. p. 411, and is very easily 

 distinguished from the other by its larger size. The second, which I was led by 

 the assertion in the Quadrupeds of North America to consider as the Hesper- 

 omys leucopus, a more careful examination and comparison have shown to be 

 entirely distinct. It appears in some degree allied to the H. gossypinus, but its 

 manners are very different. 



H. COGNATUS. 



Hair dark plumbeous, above tipt with dusky and rufous-brown, with the 

 latter more particularly on the sides, beneath with white, but in such a manner 

 that the dark color of the lower portion of the hair shines through tbe 

 white. Head large rather blunt, upper half of the cheeks inclining to rufous, 

 ears large, open, naked except the lower part of the outer edge, feet flesh-color, 

 tail slightly hairy, beneath whitish. 



Length 3.4 in. Tail 2.2 in. Head 1.2. Fore leg 1.1. Hind leg 1.6. 



This animal is easily distinguished from the H. leucopus by the under parts 

 never being of the pure and snowy whiteness that gives so much beauty to the 

 northern animal; they are however very nearly related. The relative difference 

 of the fore and hind legs is not so great as to cause it to leap and not to run 

 when endeavoring to escape pursuit. In size its dissimilarity to the H. gossy- 

 pinus is most remarkable. This last also has tbe under side of the tail pale 

 brown. The other likewise wants tbe narrow whitish border to the ears. 



Inhabits Georgia and South Carolina; in the winter it frequents houses like 

 its analogue in the north. 



I have the pleasure to add to our daily increasing Fauna another species of this 

 genus which I have received from Michigan. It likewise appears somewhat 

 allied to H. leucopus but has very distinctive characters in its colors. 



H. GRACILIS. 



Hair dark slate-color above, a little tipped with brown, cheeks, line above 

 the mouth, chin, throat and body beneath white, allowing the dark color of 

 ihe lower part of the hair to shine through in such a manner as to cause 

 these parts to appear grey. Outer side of fore legs brownish, thighs slate- 

 < olored both above and beneath, feet pale grey, nearly white. Head narrow, nose 

 somewhat pointed, ears large, open, narrowly edged with whitish. Tail longer 

 than the head and body. 



Length 3.8 in. Tail 4 in. Head 1.2. Ears .6. Fore leg .1. Hind leg 1.5. 



Inhabits Michigan ; Prof. Baird. 



We have in this genus three species which resemble each other. I have added 

 below, short diagnostic marks by which they may be easily distinguished. 



H. leucopus, supra laete badius, interdum prope aurantiacus, subtus niveus, 

 coloribus a se abrupte disjunctis, pedibus posticis anticis plus duplo longioribus. 



H. cognatus, supra nigro-fuscescente, et fusco variegatus, subtus albidus 

 tanquam cinereo-mixtus, pedibus nontam imparibus. 



H. gossypinus, supra fuscescente-badius, lateribus dilutioribus, subtus 

 cinerascente-albidus. Corporis magnitudine valde a duobus precedentibus differt.

Mr. Vaux, on behalf of a Committee appointed In 1852, to collect 

 funds for enlarging and improving the Hall, read the following Report : 



The Committee, as constituted by the Academy, September 2S, 1852, to solicit 

 subscriptions for the purpose of enlarging and altering the Hall, beg leave to 

 present the following Report : 



The amount originally esiimated as requisite for the contemplated improve- 

 ments was $6,500, which the Committee were soon enabled to announce to the 

 Society had been obtained. But before a contract had been closed for the 

 work, a great advance took place in the price of labor and materials. Other im- 

 portant alterations and additions also were proposed. A new estimate was then

[December, 



made, greatly exceeding the first. The Committee continued their labors, and 

 they have now the pleasure to state in this, their final report, that their efforts 

 were crowned with success, and that the whole amount required for carrying 

 out the plan of the Building Committee, including the alterations referred to, 

 and others also which became necessary during the progress of the work, has 

 been subscribed, collected and paid over to the Treasurer.

1855.] 449 



Mr. Vaux, on behalf of the Committee appointed January '25th, 1853, 

 to superintend the enlargement of the Hall of the Academy, presented a 

 final report, exhibiting the cost of the improvement, and its satisfactory 

 completion. 



The original estimated cost of the work, $6,500, was increased to 

 $10,500, in consequence of an extension of the plan, and a great ad- 

 vance in the price of labor and materials. During the progress of the 

 work, other alterations and additions, which could not be foreseen 

 or provided for beforehand, were also determined on, at a cost of 

 $1,763 above the contract, making the whole expense $12,263, all 

 which had been received. A final settlement had been made with the 

 contractor during the present month. 



The Librarian read the following Heport : 



REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN FOR 1855. 



Since the last Annual Meeting, in December, 1854, the additions to the Library 

 consist of 233 volumes, 561 periodicals and serials, 70 pamphlets, and 9 maps, 

 on the following subjects : 



Natural Sciences, - 

 Anatomy and Physiology, - 



Journals, Trans., Memoirs, and Proceed, of Societies "I 

 and Cyclopaedias, - - f 



Physical Science and Chemistry, - 

 Voyages and Travels, - 

 History and Biography, - 

 Antiquities and the Fine Arts, - 

 Miscellaneous, - 

 Maps, 9 



Making a total of 857 additions for 1855. 



These have been derived from the following sources ; 

 Societies, Corporations and Governments 313 ; Members and Correspondents 46 ; 

 Dr. Wilson 410. 



The inconveniences arising from insufficient accommodations for the books, 

 which have been alluded to in previous reports, happily no longer exist. The col- 

 lections which formerly occupied the room on the right of the George street en- 

 trance, have been removed to more appropriate places provided for them in the 

 upper Hall, and this fine apartment has been tastefully fitted up during the past 

 summer, and now forms part of the Library. It communicates directly with the 

 adjoining rooms, comprises an area of about 1400 square feet, has a gallery ex- 

 tending round it, and is furnished with cases which occupy the walls, and which, 

 it is estimated, will accommodate about 10,000 volumes. 



There are now three distinct apartments occupied as a Library, all on the 

 basement floor, well lighted, and comprising togetheran area of upwards of 2400 

 square feet. A new arrangement of the Books has been made, which, it is 

 hoped, will afford increased facilities to those consulting them. The accommo- 

 dations for them are now ample for any ordinary increase for many years. 



A favorable opportunity ha3 been afforded by this re-arrangement, for making 

 another enumeration of volumes possessed by the Society. These have been 

 found to number at this date over 15,000, distributed as follows : 




450 [Decejibej 



Natural Sciences, ------ 



Anatomy and Physiology, - 



Journals, Trans., Mem., &c, - 



Dictionaries of Arts and Sciences, - 



Voyages and Travels, - 



Antiquities and the Fine Arts, - 



Historical Documents (estimated), - 



Chemistry and Physical Science, - 



History and Geography, - 



Miscellaneous, ------ 



Maps in volumes, ------ 



15006 

 There is also a very large collection of tracts, periodicals, serials, &c, which, 

 when bound into volumes, will doubtless swell the aggregate to 15500. The 

 first enumeration was made in December 1850. At that date the number in 

 the Library was 11,557, exclusive of 500 estimated volumes of tracts, &c. The 

 increase therefore in five years, has been about 3500, or an average annual in- 

 crease of nearly 700 volumes. By comparing the corresponding items in the two 

 statements for 1850 and 1855, it will be found that a very large proportion of the 

 whole increase is made up of works in the various departments of Natural 

 Science, in Anatomy and Physiology, and in the Journals or Periodicals, viz., 

 1554 volumes on the Natural Sciences, 319 on Anatomy and Physiology, and 

 1029 Journals, or a total increase of upwards of 2900 volumes in these three 

 most valued and most frequently consulted departments of the Library. 



In conclusion, we may add, that during the present year, as in many others, 

 the Library owes all that it has received to the relations the Academy has formed 

 with other scientific bodies, or to the generosity and liberality of its friends and 

 supporters. Respectfully submitted by 



Wm. S. Zantzinger, Librarian. 

 December 25, 1855. 



The Report of the Treasurer for 1855 was read and referred to the 

 Auditors. 



Dr. Leidy read the following Report : 



REPORT OF THE CURATORS FOR 1855. 



Since the last annual Report of the Curators was presented to the Academy, 

 the alterations and enlargement of the building, commenced in 1853, have been 

 completed. The character of the alterations it is unnecessary to give in this 

 place, as it is done in an especial report of the committee, which was appointed 

 to superintend the changes, and it is proposed here, merely to give a general 

 view of the present arrangement of the museum, now contained in two saloons ; 

 the one above the other. 



The upper saloon of the museum is 110 feet long, 35 feet wide, and 34 feet 

 high; and it has three ranges of galleries extending completely round. Two 

 stairways communicate with this saloon, one on each side of the back or western 

 third, and they ascend in the same position to the upper gallery. On the floor 

 the side cases are brought out upon a line with the edge of the first galleiy, leav- 

 ing behind the cases, in advance and back of the stairways, four rooms, of which 

 the two longer are appropriated to the entomological and oological cabinets, and 

 the herbarium, and the others are appropriated to the services of the conchologi- 

 cal and mineralogical committees. 



All the upright or wall cases of the upper museum saloon, with the exception 

 of four at the east end of the first gallery, numbering 169, are appropriated to 

 the ornithological collection, now in process of arrangement by Dr; Wilson. 



The middle of the floor is occupied with 48 large, horizontal cases, arranged 




1855.] 451 



in twelve double rows, and accommodating the conchological collection, now 

 under arrangement. 



The edge of the first and second galleries supports 62 horizontal cases, which 

 with four upright ones at the east end of the first gallery, contain the collection 

 of minerals, newly arranged by Messrs. Vaux and Ashmead. 



The edge of the third gallery supports 27 horizontal cases, containing Crusta- 

 cea, and 13 cases of the same kind, containing echinodermata. 



The lower museum saloon is of the same length and breadth as the upper one, 

 but is 11 feet less in height ; and it has two galleries extending entirely round, 

 except at the east end of the first range. A stair case for the admission of the 

 public, communicates with the hall in the south east corner, and in the same 

 position ascends to the second gallery. At the back third of the same gallery, 

 a stairway communicates with the saloon above ; and on the opposite side a 

 stairway ascends from the floor to the hall above, and communicates with the 

 library rooms below. 



The north-east corner of the lower museum saloon, on the floor and at the 

 termination of the first gallery, is occupied by two small rooms, appropriated to 

 the service of the mammalogical and herpetological committees. 



At the back third of the saloon, on the third floor, the side wall cases are 

 brought out on a line with the edge of the gallery, leaving behind the cases two 

 small room3, appropriated to the use of the committees on palaeontology and 

 ornithology. 



In advance of the two rooms just mentioned, large glass cases extend nearly 

 two-thirds the length of the saloon, for the accommodation of the larger mam- 

 malia and skeletons. The floor in the interspace of these cases, is occupied 

 by three longitudinal double rows of partly horizontal and upright cases, 66 in 

 number, appropriated to the collection of extinct invertebrata, and of geological 

 specimens of rocks, yet unarranged. 



In the east end of the saloon, there is one large, horizontal, transverse case, 

 and three upright wall cases, containing large specimens of extinct vertebrate 

 remains, the bulk of which collection, however, is now contained in three trans- 

 verse double rows, of partly horizontal and upright cases, 18 in number, and i^: 

 four wall cases to the north side of the latter, in the back third of the saloon. 

 The four upright cases opposite to those just indicated, together with four others 

 in the west end are appropriated to skeletons. 



The wall cases on the northern side of the first gallery, 19 in number, ac- 

 commodate the collection of reptiles, and the corresponding cases on the oppo- 

 site side, 20 in number, contain the collection of human crania. 



The edge of the first galiery supports 44 horizontal cases, containing the col- 

 lection of extinct vegetable remains, arranged by Mr. W. F. Rogers. 



In the upper gallery, in advance of the stairways, there are 30 wall cases and 

 12 long foot cases at the edge of the galleries, appropriated to the mammalogical 

 collection ; and back of the stairways there are 14 wall cases and 6 foot cases, 

 to be appropriated to the collection of fishes. 



On the two galleries at the west end, there are 8 vertical cases, and three 

 others at the side of the first landing of the stairway, in the south east corner, 

 to be used for the collection of sponges and corals. 



The furnishing of the upper museum saloon and committee rooms, important 

 alterations in the lower museum saloon, and the construction of new cases in the 

 front basement room of the building, now appropriated to the use of the library, 

 have been effected without cost to the Academy ; the expense, amounting to 

 $10,850, having been defrayed by our liberal fellow member, Dr. T. B. Wilson. 

 In the alterations the old material was used wherever it could be done with ad- 

 vantage, so that they appear to be of greater magnitude than the expense 

 would allow. 



During the year just about closing, the donations to the different departments 

 of the museum and the labors therein have been as follows : 



Mammals. Of these animals there were presented 26 specimens of 18 species, 

 among which were a reindeer from Greenland, presented by Col. G. A. McCall ; 




452 [December, 



a second specimen of the same animal and two species of Phoca, presented by 

 Dr. Wilson ; and a third species of Phoca presented by Mr. Vaux. 



Birds. Mr. Guex presented 190 bird skins from Italy; and 24 specimens were 

 presented by J. D. Sergeant, Dr. Heermann, Mr. Krider and others. 



The oological collection has been removed from the position it formerly oc- 

 cupied, and has been rearranged by Dr. Heermann, in cabinets of drawers, con- 

 structed for the purpose, and now located together with the entomological collec- 

 tion in the north east room of the upper museum hall. 



Reptiles. Of these animals, several hundred specimens of about 40 species, 

 have been presented by various members and others. 



The collection of reptiles of the Academy, has recently been arranged by Dr.

 of 26 species of fishes, from South America; Mr. Ashmead has presented 40 

 specimens of 24 species, from our coast ; and Dr. Burtt, U. S. N., has presented 

 a small collection from Madeira. Resides these, 28 specimens of 21 species have 

 been presented by various members, and 41 specimens of 22 species have been 

 received in exchange. 



Mollusks. Dr. Burtt, U. S. N., has contributed to the collection of the Acade- 

 my 98 specimens of 34 species of shells, from various parts of the world ; F. A. 

 Sauvalle, Esq., has presented 50 specimens of 16 genera of terrestrial and fiuvi- 

 atile shells of Cuba; and various members have presented numerous specimens 

 of 38 species, besides several small collections, in which the specimens were not 

 enumerated. 



Insects. Mr. Guex has enriched our entomological collection by a contribu- 

 tion of 2300 specimens of about 1800 species of coleoptera from Italy, Russia, 

 Siberia, Caucasus, Sitka, East Indies, and Australia. Mr. Andrew Murray of 

 Edinboro presented 50 specimens of African coleoptera; and several members 

 have contributed others in the various orders. 



Crustaceans, arachnides, myriapods, annelides and zoophytes. Of Crustacea 34 

 species have been presented, chiefly by Mr. Ashmead. Of arachnides 3 have 

 been presented ; of myriapods 6 ; of annelides 20, among which is one of Eunice 

 gigantea, from India, presented by Mr. Guillou ; of ecbinoderm3 12 ; of corals 

 4, among which is a fine specimen of Dendrophyllea ramea presented by Dr., 

 Burtt, U. S. N., and one of the curious Hyalonema sieboldi, or glass-coral of 

 Japan, presented by Capt. H. A. Adams, U. S. N. ; aud of sponges 4 species. 



The collection of Crustacea has been recently arranged to a considerable 

 extent, by Dr. Bridges. 



Comparative Anatomy. Of skulls of different animals 27 have been presented, 

 of which 18 are from Dr. Heermann, and among the others is an ancient Mexican 

 skull, presented by Dr. E. H. Barton of New Orleans, and the skull of a Japa- 

 nese, presented by Dr. Liner, U. S. N. Of skeletons 4 small ones were presented, 

 and of miscellaneous specimens 12. 



The collection of human crania, now numbering 1006, has lately been com- 

 pletely arranged, classified, and catalogued by Dr. J. A. Meigs. 



Botany. A collection of plants from Japan, consisting of several hundred 

 specimens, was presented by Dr. Jos. Wilson, U. S. N. ; a collection of ferri3 

 from Africa by Dr. Burtt; and a collection of 29 species marine algae by Mr. 

 Ashmead. There were also 24 other specimens, generally consisting of seeds 

 and fruits presented by different members and others. 



The herbarium of phanerogamous plants is now undergoing careful re-arrange- 

 ment by Mr. E. Durand ; and several of the members intend shortly to re-ar- 

 range the collection of cryptogamia. 



Pal&ontology. A collection of fossils, consisting of 656 specimens of 280 

 species, from the coal measures, carboniferous limestone, devonian and Silurian 

 series of Great Britain and Ireland, was presented by Dr. T. B. Wilson ; Prof. 

 B. L. C. Wailes presented 38 species of shells and corals from the tertiary beds 

 of Mississippi, being the original specimens described by Mr. Conrad; and small 

 collections from different systems were presented by Dr. W. H. Hammond, U. 




1855.] 



453 



S. A. ; Mr. Moore of Te xa3 ; J. Sampson of Indiana; and Dr. R. W. Gibbes 

 of South Carolina. Neatly 200 specimens of fossils were presented from var ici B 

 localities, by different members and others. Among them is a fragment of 

 wood weighing over 100 pounds from the drift of New Jersey, presented by Dr. 

 Camac. 



Mineralogy. Chas. M. Wheailey, Esq. preeented 41 fine specimens of mine- 

 rals, principally from Chester Co. ; Dr. T. B. Wilson presented 218 specimens of 

 European rocks ; and Mr. W. S. Wilson presented a tablet containing 60 polished 

 specimens of marbles of the Pyrenees. Besides the foregoing, 71 specimens of 

 minerals were presented by various members and other persons. 



The Museum of the Academy was re-opened to the public on the 1st of June, 

 as usual on Tuesday and Friday afternoons, from one o'clock uniil sundown ; 

 and since its re-opening the number of visitors has exceeded 7000, or an ave- 

 rage of over 1000 a month. 



In concluding this report, the Curators would respectfully direct the attention 

 of the Academy to the want of a greater number of efficient persons in various 

 committees to aid in the arrangement of many of its departments, which now 

 lie totally neglected. 



JOSEPH LEIDY, 

 Chairman of the Curators. 



On leave granted, Dr. Zantzinger presented for publication in the
