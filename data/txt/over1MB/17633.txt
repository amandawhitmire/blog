PROCEEDINGS 



OF THE 



ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES 



OF PHILADELPHIA. 



January 1, 1850. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



A letter was read, dated New York, December, 184.9, accompanying 

 the donation made this evening of the Python, from Mr. Sandwith 

 Drinker, of Hong Kong, China. 



Also a letter from Mr. J. M. Richardson, of London, dated November 

 30, 1849, desiring information of a mode of transmitting to the 

 Academy certain Nos. of the Journal of the Indian Archipelago. 



Dr. Morton, havino; resigned the Chair to Mr. Ashmead, read a 

 continuation of his Memoir on the size of the Brain in the various 

 races and families of Man ; which was referred to the Committee on 

 the previous portions of the paper. 



A communication was read from Prof. Spencer F. Baird, Corres- 

 pondent of the Academy, dated December 21, 1849. desiring to be 

 considered as a Member from that date. 



January \^th. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



Dr. Morton read a continuation of his paper on the size of the 

 Brain in the various races of Man, which was referred to the Com- 

 mittee on the previous portions. 



He then followed with some remarks on the volume of the brain in 

 the savage tribes, which he stated to be greater than in the half 

 civilized races of Mexico and Peru. He mentioned some facts proving 

 the antiquity of the characteristics of the several groups of the human 

 race, and exhibited some plates from the forthcoming work of Dr. 

 Lepsius, representing purely Egyptian forms copied from bas-reliefs 

 in tombs at the base of the great Pyramid, dating back 34-00 years 

 before Christ. Also some copies of pictures in temples more than 

 2000 years later, still exhibiting the same well marked characters of 



PROCEED. ACAD. NAT. SCI. OF I'HII.ADELPHIA. VOL. V. NO. I. 1 




2 [Jan. 



the race : the greater the antiquity, the more decided were these 

 characters. 



Dr. Morton thought that it would be now admitted that at the 

 earliest period known, the groups of the human family presented as 

 great diversity as at present. The Egyptian crania in his collection, 

 taken from the identical tombs referred to, at the base of the great 

 Pyramid, as well as those from Thebes and Memphis, when compared 

 with the figures in Dr. Lepsius' plates, exhibited a most marked resem- 

 blance. The Egyptian tombs, although occupied by successive families, 

 still contained the original occupants, and in all places presented 

 skulls possessing the same peculiarities of type. The modern Egyptian 

 Fellahs are the old Egyptians crossed with the Arabs. The skull of 

 the old Egyptian cannot be confounded with that of any other race. 



January 22d. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



Mr. Conrad read a paper, intended for publication in the Journal, 

 entitled, " Descriptions of eight new species of Eocene Shells." Re- 

 ferred to Mr. Phillips, Dr. Griffith and Dr. Wilson. 



A paper by Mr. Peter A. Browne, entitled " Examination and 

 descriptions of the tegumentary appendages of the Ornithorynchus 

 paradoxus," was read and referred to Mr. Phillips, Dr. Morton and 

 Mr. Cassin, 



Dr. Morton havino; resisined the Chair to Dr. Ruschenberser, made 

 some remarks supplementary to those offered at the last meeting, and 

 also in continuation of the subject of his Memoir on the size of the 

 Brain in Man. 



January 29th. 



Mr. Phillips in the Chair. 



The Publication Committee announced that Part 4, Vol. 1, New

Francis N. Euck, Esq., of Philadelphia, was elected a Member; and 

 the Chevalier Manoel Ferreira Lagos, of Rio Janeiro, was elected a 

 Correspondent of the Academy. 



February 5th. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



Letters were read : 



From the Secretary of the Linnean Society, of London, acknow- 

 ledging the receipt of Part 3, Vol. 1, New Series of the Journal. 



From the Principal Librarian of the British Museum, returning 

 acknowledgments for Nos. 9 and 10, Vol. 4, of the Proceedings. 



From the Corresponding Secretary of the National Institute at 

 Washington, acknowledging the receipt of Nos. 9, 10, and 11, Vol. 4, 

 of Proceedings. 



Dr. Morton, in confirmation of some remarks made on several pre- 

 vious occasions, on the characteristic conformation of the Egyptian 

 cranium, exhibited several skulls from his collection, taken from 

 tombs dating upwards of 3000 years before the Christian Era. These 

 skulls shovved a remarkable delicacy of structure of the whole 

 cranio-facial region ; the cranium being of an elongated oval form, 

 the facial angle averaging 78, and the internal capacity 80 cubic 

 inches; in the last respect corresponding to the modern Fellah of the 

 Nile, 



The expression of the bones of the face of the ancient Egyptian is 

 neither European nor Asiatic, but peculiar, S2d generis. The Arab- 

 Eo'vptian, or Fellah of the present day, is the Arab engrafted on the 

 Ancient Egyptian, and dates from the sixth century of our Era. All 

 the Coptic heads of the present period have some negro characters : 

 they are those of the population of the towns which are notoriously 

 licentious. The Fellahs, or rural population, are free from this 

 taint.

Dr. Leidy read the followinf^, being a report by Prof. Haldeman, 

 Chairman of the Committee on Entomology, oa the progress of that 

 science during the past year. 



Report on the Progress of Entomology in the United States daring the year 1849. 



By S. S. Haldeman. 



Whilst the progress of Entomology during the year 1849 has been sufficiently 

 encouraging, it cannot be doubted that it would advance more rapidly if there 

 were one or more general works upon the subject, adapted to this country. The 

 student is now retarded either by the extent of the subject, or because he cannot 

 consult standard collections, works, or figures of American genera and species; 

 whilst such as have passed through the preliminary difficulties, generally prefer 

 original research to the preparation of works which partake in some degree of 

 the nature of compilations ; and on account of the expense of figures, authors 

 usually limit them to their own discoveries. 



Another cause which retards the natural sciences in general, in a country 

 where the amount of material to be investigated is extensive, is the want of 

 instruction in them in our educational institutions, in but few of which their 

 claims to a place among the sciences are acknowledged. Such causes tend to 

 limit the number of observers, and must be taken into consideration in estimating 

 the condition of certain sciences in this country.

 Coleoptera, intended to form the nucleus of a collection in a department which 

 had been previously neglected in forming the cabinet, and preparing the zoology 

 of the State. 



17. During the year, Ecotwmic entomology has been enriched by the discovery 

 by Miss Morris, of a new destroyer of the peach tree, which proves to be the 

 Tomicics liminaris of Say. It wounds the bark by boring through it and feeding 

 upon the living portion. I have found another bark borer {Hylesinus aculeatus 

 Say) feeding upon the inner living bark of the white ash, Fraxinus acuminata. 

 Miss Morris has communicated to me a curculionid, the Baris tripicnctatus of 

 Say, which a friend of hers discovered to be one of the destroyers of the potato, 

 in the stem of which the larva bores passages and undergoes its transformations. 



The Crustacea have been enriched during the past year by the elaborate and 

 valuable papers of Prof. Dana.

 Columbia, 1848 (distributed in 1849) contains a "Catalogue of the Fauna of South 

 Carolina " in which there is an excellent catalogue of the Crustacea by Prof. 

 Gibbes of Charleston. 



A paper was read from I\Ir. Conrad, describing new species of fresh 

 water shells from Arkansas and from Australia, and referred to a com- 

 mittee, consisting of Mr. Phillips, Dr. Wilson and Dr. Griffith. 



Dr. Leidy offered the following remarks: 



Dr. Leidy stated it was now eighteen months since he had sought for Entophyta 

 within living animals, having been previously impressed with the belief of their 

 existence upon reflecting upon the essential conditions of life. Four months 

 since he exhibited to the Academy numerous drawings, and specimens of ento- 

 phyta obtained from living animals ; he now exhibited others. 



The essential conditions of Life are five in number, viz., a germ, nutritive 

 matter, air, water, and heat. The four latter undoubtedly exist in the interior of 

 living animals, animal or entozoa germs also are well known to exist, and it was 

 rendered extremely probable that vegetable germs would also exist, and with 

 them all the conditions necessary to vegetable growth. Plants have been very 

 frequently observed growing upon the exterior of animals and less frequently 

 upon the interior, most usually upon diseased surfaces, but the growth of such 

 parasites had not been pointed out as a normal and common condition as in the 

 case of entozoa. 



Dr. L. next reviewed the theory of generation. He inclines to the opinion 

 that sexual elements are absolutely necessary for the perpetuation of germs. He 

 considers the alternation of generation in certain animals no objection to the law, 

 for after successive developments an admixture of the sexual elements is observed 

 to be necessary. The reproduction among Cryptogamia may probably often exhibit 

 phenomena analogous to the alternation of generation of animals, but universally 

 he thinks it will be discovered that a true sexual admixture takes place in every 

 species of these plants at some period of their life. According to the observations 

 of Schimper it is necessary among the mosses. From an observation made by 

 Klencke, upon a fungus which grew upon a diseased surface. Dr. L. thinks that 

 sexual admixture would be discovered to take place in the mycelium. In nume- 

 rous instances it had been observed among the Algae. He stated he thought he 

 had noticed the process in Achyla prolifera, and gave a description of the pheno- 

 mena. He finally considers that science is on the eve of demonstrating the 

 existence of a law "that an admixture of sexual elements is necessary for the 

 perpetuation of specific life germs." 



He then exhibited numerous elaborate drawings of new entophyta observed 

 growing in the ventriculus of Passalus cornutus, a remarkable one growing in a 

 honey-like liquid in the proventriculus of the larva of Arctia Isabella, another 




8 [Feb. 



from Acheta abbreviata, etc. He remarked that when such plants were found in 

 animals they were usually very abundant. 



Dr. L. then stated that very slight modifications in the five essential conditions 

 of life were siiUlcient to produce the vast variety of living beings upon the globe. 

 As an instance, he mentioned he had lying upon his table a saucer with a cork 

 bottom, in which lay a partly dissected Passalus cornutus half immersed in water. 

 Two days afterwards he noticed upon the part of the insect above the water a 

 quantity of Mucor mucedo? growing, and from the part within the water nume- 

 rous fine, stiff filaments, which upon examination proved to be Achyla prolifera; 

 upon the cork around th'e insect grew a third genus, consisting of fine cottony 

 filaments, which were articulated, of which he exhibited a drawing; and upon 

 the insect at the surface of the water, but not within the latter, grew a fourth 

 genus, of which he also exhibited a drawing. 



He also stated he had had the jood fortune of observing in a single morning all 

 the stages of development of Achyla prolifera growing from some individuals of 

 Ascarides which had been lying in a dish of water for a few days. 



In reply to some remarks made by members. Dr. Leidysaid he could not admit 

 the doctrine of spontaneous generation, but rather thought modifications in the 

 essential conditions of life favorable to the development of different, and always 

 pre-existing germs derived from a parent. 



February 19th. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



A letter was read from Mr. J.T. Becker, dated Paris, 10th December, 

 184-9, proposing exchanges with the Academy in Entomology. Referred 

 to the Committee on Entomology. 



Also a letter from H. Lecog, dated Clermon-ferrand, January 10, 

 18.50, proposing exchanges in Conchology with the Academy, or 

 with individual members of the Society. Referred to the Committee 

 on Conchology. 



Dr. Leidy offered the following observations : 



Dr. Leidy presented to the examination of the Society a colored and several 

 other drawings of what he termed an entophytic forest, taken from a portion of 

 the mucous membrane of the ventriculus of Passalus cornutus. He remarked 

 that at least six species of entophyta were found growing upon the mucous mem- 

 brane of the ventriculus of P. coinutus, which were often present in great quan- 

 tity, frequently some thousands, and which from their number, polymorphous 

 appearance of several species, and attachment to various appendages of the 

 mucous membrane, resembled very strikingly a miniature Brazilian forest, which 

 was heightened in some degree by the existence of a nematoid worm, which 

 recalled to mind the idea of one of the serpents of such a forest. 



A somewhat similar drawing he exhibited, taken from the small intestine of 

 Julus marginatus. 



Other drawings were also presented. Dr. L. stated that among his collection 

 of living Julides. he had a number of times observed individuals to become dull 




1850.] 9 



in color, and become almost motionless, which phenomena were followed by the 

 death of the animal. It occurred to him that, in such a state, there might be 

 exhibited some change in the character of its entophyta, as usually found in the 

 active condition of the animal. Upon removing the intestine of an individual 

 which had just died, he noticed that the entozoa which usually occupied the small 

 intestine, had passed into the rectum, and upon the surface of the mucous mem- 

 brane of the former, was developed a new plant. This is an oblate spheroidal 

 body, white in color, translucent, embossed upon the surface, and presenting, 

 when viewed by transmitted light, some resemblance to a minute bleached shell 

 of an Echinus ; by reflected light, it resembled a minute, white Lycoperdon. 

 This plant was strewed all over the mucous membrane, but grew in greatest 

 quantity along the course of filaments of Enterobrus, which appeared attached to 

 the mucous membrane throughout their length by it. When compressed it opened, 

 and spread into several leaf-like segments, and exuded a clear fluid with faint 

 granules. He thought that probably this plant might be another stage in the 

 existence of Enterobrus, for in the large number of individuals of Julus which he 

 had examined, upwards of 130, although he had observed the development of 

 Enterobrus from spore-like bodies, even to the formation of what he supposed to 

 be the sporangia, yet he had never been able to detect the formation of spores, 

 and when he saw this new plant enveloping the Enterobrus filaments, he sus- 

 pected that there might be a phenomenon here presented analogous to the alter- 

 nation of generation in certain animals, but had not yet satisfied himself that such 

 was the case. 



He also stated he had discovered a fourth species of Enterobrus in Polydesmus 

 virginiensis, and another entophyte analogous to Enterobrus growing in Poly- 

 desmus granulatus. The latter differs from Enterobrus in having numerous 

 globular cells at the free extremity of the principal cell. He adverted to the 

 several theories of cell formation, and said that in the last mentioned plant, in 

 the development of the globular terminal cells, the division of the permanent cell 

 wall followed the division of the cell contents. In conclusion, he observed, that 

 these matters would be more fully treated of hereafter, in a memoir which he was 

 preparing on the subject.

Dr. Elwyn in the Chair. 



A communication was read from the American Philosophical 

 Society, dated March 2d, 1850, acknowledging the receipt of Part 4, 

 Vol. 1, of the Journal of the Academy. 



A letter from H. W. Ravenel, Esq., dated Black Oak, South Caro- 

 lina, Feb. 26th, 1850, stating his intention to forward without delay a 

 package of South Carolina plants for the Academy, and making in- 

 quiries respecting exchanges. Referred to the Botanical Committee. 



Dr. Morton presented the following letter from Elliot Cresson, Esq., 

 of Philadelphia, addressed to the members of the Academy, dated 

 March 5th. 



"It will doubtless be gratifying to you to learn that the attention of scientific 

 men is turned, with deep interest, upon the long neglected continent of Africa: 

 and it is equally due to you and to the distinguished gentlemen who have made so 

 liberal an offer, to state that Hon. John Short, of Cincinnati, and Professor Charles 

 Short, of Louisville, have most munificently offered to bear all the expense of a 

 botanical mission to Africa, provided a person of proper zeal and other qualifica- 

 tions can be obtained for the service. Professor Christy, of Oxford, Ohio, has 

 also expressed to us his wish to make a geological survey of Africa." 



The letter was, on motion, referred to the Zoological Committee. 

 The following, from the same, was also read. 



Extract from a letter from Senator Stephen A. Benson to Elliott Cresson, dated 

 Bassa Cove, Republic of Liberia, October 2Bth, 1849. 



"I had almost forgotten to tender you my thanks for the pamphlet forwarded 

 to me, containing some observations on the Hippopotamus Liberiensis. This 

 animal inhabits all the larger rivers of Liberia, and I have known seven in all to 

 be killed by the natives living near the St. John's river, but have never seen but 

 one myself. This one was shot by a native in 1835, on an island in this river 

 opposite Bexley, and so far as I can now remember, it corresponded with the de- 

 scription given by Dr. Morton and his correspondents. The natives say that 

 they are to be frequently seen upon the islands opposite and above Bexley." 



March \2th. 

 Mr. Pearsall in the Chair. 



A note was read from Elliott Cresson, Esq., dated Philadelphia, 

 March 8ih, 1850, presenting a collection of Coleopterous insects from 

 Liberia.

A letter from Maximilian Prince de Wied, dated Neu-wied on the 

 Rhine, January 8th, 1850, offering to exchange specimens of European 

 Quadrupeds, Birds, &c,, for those of this country. Referred to the 

 Zoological Committee. 



A communication from Dr. Lewis R. Gibbes, dated Charleston, 

 March 5th, 1850, accompanying "A Catalogue (prepared by himself) 

 of the Crustacea in the Cabinet of the Academy of Natural Sciences of 

 Philadelphia, February 20th, 1847, with notes on the most remark- 

 able." The latter being intended for publication, was referred to a 

 Committee consisting of Drs. Bridges, Zantzinger, and Leidy. 



On motion of Mr. Vaux it was Resolved, That the Publication Com- 

 mittee be authorized to transmit to the American Academy of Arts 

 and Sciences, such numbers of the first series of the Journal as the 

 Committee may deem expedient. 



March I9th. 



Dr, Morton, President, in the Chair. 



A communication was read from Peter A. Browne, Esq., entitled 

 " Microscopic description of some piles on the head of Albinos." Re- 

 ferred to Mr, Fisher, Dr. Elwyn, and Prof. Haldeman. 



On leave granted the Zoological Committee, to which was referred 

 the Messrs. Short's communication to Mr. Elliott Cresson, of Philadel- 

 phia, in relation to their proposed scientific expedition to Africa, re- 

 ported that it was inexpedient to recommend any action on the subject 

 at this time by the Academy. 



March 26th. 



The Committee to which was referred Prof. Gibbes' Catalogue of 

 the Crustacea in the Cabinet of the Academy, reported in favor of its 

 publication in the Proceedings, with observations by the Committee. 



Catalogue of the Crustacea in the Cabinet of the Academy of Natural Sciences of 

 Philadelphia, Aug-ust 20th, 1847, with Notes on the most remarhahle. 



By Prof. Lewis R. Gibbes, Charleston, South Carolina. 



In August, 1847, the collection of Crustacea in the Cabinet of the Academy- 

 was kindly laid open to me for inspection and study ; and as the specimens were 

 not all labelled, I endeavored to make some return for the favor by labelling the 

 whole collection, as far as practicable, in the few days I spent in the city, in a 

 mode uniform with that I adopted for the collection belonging to the Boston 

 Society of Natural History. No labels were attached, of course, to those speci- 




1850.] 23 



mens described by Mr. Say and Dr. Randall, which retained the original labels. 

 The catalogue given below, with the notes on the principal species, were made 

 during the examination of the collection, and I had intended to communicate them 

 to the Academy soon after my return home, but several circumstances, which it 

 is hardly necessary to mention, prevented my doing so as early as I intended, 

 and I offer them now, as I believe no communication has yet been made to the 

 Academy of the extent of their collection. The catalogue includes the Podoph- 

 thalmian Crustacea only, as there were but few specimens belonging to the other 

 subdivisions, and those not all in good condition. 



In a few cases I have had to correct the determinations of Dr. Randall. The 

 necessity for these corrections I communicated to Dr. R. after my return home, 

 and begged that he would himself correct his own errors ; but his distance from 

 the specimens, and his present engagements, have induced him to entrust that 

 office to me. I have therefore made the requisite corrections, influenced by that 

 friendly consideration for Dr. R. which a consciousness of one's own liability to 

 error should ever induce for the errors of others. 



The nomenclature adopted is in general that of Milne Edwards.

NOTES 



2. Lepidoptera calcarata. All that remains of Say's original specimen is the 

 stomachal region of the carapace, with the eyes and rostrum attached. This was 

 found in Charleston harbor; a second specimen has not, as far as I know, been 

 yet obtained. 



5. Libinia affinis, Randall, hardly appears to differ from L. diibia, M. Edw. 



6. Lissa fissirostra is the name under which Say described this species. Some 




26 [March, 







of our naturalists regard it as identical with Hyas coarctata of the British coasts. 

 I have had no opportunity of comparing specimens from both shores of the 

 Atlantic, but the American species appears to me to resemble most Hyas aranea, 

 judging from the figure in Herbst's work. 



9. Mithrax spinosissimus. The specimen in the collection is of unusual size. 

 Carapace 7 inches in length, as many in breadth, and 3 inches thick; hand and 

 finger 7 inches long, 2J broad; whole length of one of the first pair of feet 13 

 inches. 



12. Pericera cornuta. This specimen has been described by Dr. Randall 

 (Jour. Acad. Nat. Sci., vol. viii., p. 108) as Chorinus armatus. It does not 

 belong to the genus Chorinus, as the orbits of the eyes are not incomplete, as 

 they are in that genus, but embrace the peduncle of the eye on all sides like a 

 tube, allowing no other motion to the eye than that of retraction or protrusion. 

 On comparison, Dr. R.'s description will be found to agree in general with that 

 given by M. Edwards of Pericera cornuta, (Hist. Crust., tome I, p. 335,) and a 

 reference to the figure given in Hughes' Nat. Hist, of Barbadoes, pi. 25, fig. 3, or 

 to Herbst, pi. 59, fig. 6, will complete the proof. 



13 and 14. Epialtns Nuttalii and productus Randall appear to be new and well 

 marked species. 



22. Pseudocarcinus raercenaria is the Cancer mercenaria of Say, (Jour. Acad. 

 Nat. Sci., vol. I, p. 448,) abundant along our southern coast. It is referred by 

 M. Edwards, with some doubt, to the genus Xantho of Leach, (M. Edw. Hist. 

 Crust., tome I, p. 399,) but I have no hesitation in referring it to his own genus 

 Pseudocarcinus, and am disposed to think that he had it before him when writing 

 his description of Pseudocarcinus ocellatus, (op. cit., p. 409.) His description 

 applies in every particular, but is short. The country of his specimens he says 

 is unknown. 



25. Platycarcinus productus, Randall, is a distinct species from the three others 

 known. 



28. Trapezia cymodoce. The specimens in the collection agree exactly with 

 Guerin's figure, (Voy. Coq. Crust., pi. 1, fig. 4.) M. Edwards' remarks are 

 very just with regard to the difference between Guerin's Trapezia cymodoce, 

 and the Cancer cymodoce of Herbst. 



33. Lupa cribraria. The crab of our southern coast described by Say as Lupa 

 maculata, (J. A. N. S., vol. I, p. 445,) appears, by Edwards' description and 

 figure, (op. cit., tome 1, p. 452, pi. 17,' fig. 1,) to be same as Lamarck's Por- 

 tunus cribrarius, (Anim. sans Vert., tome V., p. 259, and 2^- edit., t. V., p. 

 476.) Say's paper was read Dec. 1st, 1818, and Lamarck's fifth volume was 

 published, as declared by the title page, in July, 1818, and his name has right of 

 priority, and I have therefore adopted it. 



35. Lupa pelagica. This specimen has Say's original label affixed, and is 

 doubtless one of the specimens described by him in the Jour. Acad., vol. I, p. 97. 

 It is not the L. pelagica of M. Edwards, and does not appear to be the young of 

 the L. dicantha common along our coast; but further examination is requisite to 

 determine what claims it has to be considered new. 



He refers, through mistake, to pi. 18, fig. 1. 




1850.] 



07 



39. Potamia latifrons, Randall, is distinct from Boscia dentata, M. Edw. 

 Potamia, as generic name, ought to take precedence of Boscia. 



40. Orthostoma dentata, Randall, forms a genus distinct from the others of the 

 same group. 



49. Macrophthalmus compressipes, Randall, is a distinct species, and is the 

 same as the M. podophthalmus figured in the Voyage of the Boiiite. Priority of 

 publication must determine which name shall prevail. The text of the work I 

 have not seen. 



53. Grapsus cruentatus. The individuals in the Collection of the Academy, 

 belonging to this species, were erroneously regarded by Dr. Randall as new, and 

 were described by him as G. longipes, in the Journal of the Academy, (vol. viii, 

 p. 125.) It was doubtless a mistaken supposition that they were brought from 

 Surinam, as stated p. 126, and this error probably misled Dr. R. 



55. Grapsus rudis, M. Edw., is the same as G. hirtus, Randall, (J. A. N. S., 

 vol. viii, p. 124.) Milne-Edwards' name has priority. With him I regard G. 

 rudis as distinct from G. pictus, though it differs only in the following particulars : 

 the carapace is clothed with numerous but distant transverse lines of hairs; the 

 front is not so perpendicularly turned down ; the four lobes of the front are more 

 tuberculous, and the limbs smaller when compared with the body. There is but 

 one specimen in the collection, but that is in good condition. 



56 and 57. Pachygrapsus crassipes and P. parallelus appear to be distinct from 

 the described species of the genus Grapsus. 



66. Guaia ornata. This is a very distinct and pretty species of the genus 

 Guaia, described by Dr. Randall as Ilia ornata, (J. A. N. S., vol. viii, p. 129,) 

 but it really belongs to the genus to which I have referred it. This error, of 

 confounding the two genera, Ilia and Guaia, has been committed by others be- 

 sides Dr. R., until specimens really belonging to the genus Ilia fell into their 

 hands, when a distinctive character is at once perceived in the peculiar contorted 

 form of the hands in this genus. For want of attention to this point, Myra fugax 

 and Guaia punctata have been confounded with Ilia punctata, many points in the 

 description of each being common. 



68. Ranina' dentata. Two fine specimens. Dimensions of largest : carapace 

 4J inches long, 42 broad ; carapace and abdomen extended, 7 inches ; breadth of 

 hand, finger excluded, li inch, including finger, 2i inches; length of thumb or 

 moveable finger, 1 J inch ; length of one of the first pair of feet, thumb extended, 

 is 7 inches. 



70. Blepharipoda occidentals, Randall. A well marked genus. The indi- 

 vidual is a female; abdomen with appendages, first pair of feet cheliform; hence 

 it is near Albunea, but quite distinct. 



74. Porcellana sociata, Say. In Say's article (J. A. N. S. vol. i, p. 456) the 

 name of this species is given P. soriata. Say's original specimen is still in the 

 collection of the Academy, but the label could not be found to determine how he 

 wrote the name ; there can be but little doubt that the name as printed is a typo- 

 graphical error arising from an imperfection in the manuscript, and that Leach, 

 Desmarest, and Milne Edwards are right in regarding sociata as the true specific 

 name; an imperfectly formed c connected with the preceding letter being easily 

 mistaken for one of the manuscript forms of r. Another example of deviation 




2S [March, 



from the original orthography is furnished by Leach's genus Lupa, but in this 

 case the deviation is unjustifiable. In Leach's article Crustaceology, in the 

 Edinb. Encycl., he uses Lupa throughout, and Desmarest does the same in the 

 Consid. Gen. Crust. Milne Edwards, misled apparently by the orthography of 

 the name in French, Lupee, erroneously uses Lupea in his Hist. Nat. Crust, 

 tom i. p. 445, (text and note), while in the references in the notes in the following 

 pages, he uses Lupa; in his notes to the second edition of Lamarck's Anim. sans 

 Vert. tom. v. p. 473, he gives Leach's genus as Lupea, while in the references to 

 his own work (Hist. Nat. Crust.) on page 476, he uses thrice Lupa, and once 

 Lupea. Lastly, in the Appendix to Leach's own article in Edinb. Encyc, the 

 genus is called Lima ! 



89. Ibachus antarcticus. One individual marked as " brought from Santa Cruz 

 by R. E. Griffith," agrees with Milne Edwards' character for I. antarcticus, the 

 spine being present on the fifth pair of feet, the absence of which marks his I. Parrae, 

 a native of the Antilles. Is I. Parrae a distinct species? or is it only imperfectly 

 distinguished by the character he assigns to it ? 



98. Alpheus dispar, Randall, is hardly distinct from A. brevirostris, M. Edw. 



101. Hippolyte gracilipes. The specimen thus labelled was in bad condition, 

 but certainly belongs to the genus Palemon ; probably some interchange of labels 

 had taken place. 



103. Palemon Gaudichaudii, M. Edw. Two fine specimens of this species of 

 Milne Edwards, first brought from Chili by Gaudichaud. 



111. Squilla empusa. The specimen I labelled thus, was said to be brought 

 from the Pacific, and does not perceptibly differ from S. empusa, Say, from the 

 Atlantic coast; if it really came from the Pacific, direct comparison with 

 S. empusa of our Coast ought to be made, which I was not able to do for want of 

 specimens of the latter at hand. 



113. Squilla Cerisii. This specimen was brought from the Pacific, and agreed 

 with M. Edward's description of the S. cerisii of Roux, inhabiting the Mediter- 

 ranean ; direct comparison is necessary to determine in what points they really 

 differ. It is more probably the same as S. Lessonii, of Guerin. 



There were also some eight or ten undetermined species, and several of Say's 

 original specimens of the lower orders of the Crustacea. 



Several of the species described by Dr. Randall were wanting, and have been 

 omitted of course in the preceding catalogue.

read before the Academy, June ISth, 1839, although not actually published in the 

 Journal until January, 1840. 



Prof. Gibbes in stating that several of Dr. Randall's specimens had been lost, 

 has overlooked Xantho intonsus, Rand., which is still in the cabinet of the 

 Academy. But one other species is omitted in Prof. Gibbes' list, Astacus 

 Oregonus, which was lost or destroyed while in the hands of the artist by whom 

 the drawing, published in the eighth volume of the Journal, was made. 



The Committee to which was referred Mr. Peter A. Browne's paper 

 on the hair of the Ornithorynchus paradoxus, reported that in conse- 

 quence of the author's observations having been already anticipated by 

 a number of distinguished naturalists and others, the Committee deem 

 it inexpedient to recomniend Mr. Browne's paper for publication. 



In accordance with a resolution offered at last meeting of business, 

 a life membership was conferred on Dr. J. K. Townsend, in return for 

 his numerous valuable contributions to the Cabinet, at various times. 



ELECTION. 



M. Alfred Malherbe, President of the National Academy of Metz, in 

 France, was elected a Correspondent, and Charles M. Wheatley, Esq., 

 of New York, was elected a Member of the Academy. 



^pn7 2d. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



A letter was read from the Lyceum of Natural History of New York, 

 dated March 26th, 1S50, acknowledging the receipt of Vol. 3, No. 3, 

 and Vol. 4, Nos. 912, of the Proceedings, and Vol. 8, Part 2, first 

 series of the Journal. 



Also a letter from Mr. James Deane, offering to prepare for publica- 

 tion in the Journal of the Academy, a paper on the fossils of the new 

 red sandstone of the Connecticut valley. Referred to the Publication 

 Committee. 



Dr. Morton, on resigning the chair to Mr. Vaux, then read a 

 further continuation of his paper on the size of the brain in the various 

 races of Man. 



The following is an analysis of this portion of the Memoir : 

 In regard to the diversity of the human species, some ethnologists account 

 for it by supposing changes to be effected by varieties in food, vicissitudes 

 of climate, and other physical agents. Others again attribute the differences 

 to the rise of accidental varieties, by which individuals have been produced, from 

 whom, at first, tribes, then races and nations have sprung in succession. 



If, therefore, we suppose all mankind to have been originally white, the hypo- 

 thesis would necessarily require that negroes must be a mere accidental variety. 

 This is Dr. Prichard's view of the case. 




1850.] 



31 



Dr. Morton said analogical reasoning, based upon the known changes which 

 occur among the lower animals, would lead us into error if applied to Man. For 

 instance, the Reindeer of Lapland do not change in the slightest particular after 

 long domestication. The Peacock, also, has not varied during thousands of 

 years, unless some few tints originally perfectly blue may have become green- 

 ish. Other instances of this kind might be enumerated. 



Again, some animals in a very short time, in two or three generations, become 

 entirely changed in color, as the Guinea pig and the turkey. Sometimes even 

 the anatomical structure undergoes material changes under the influence of do- 

 mestication ; for instance, in the common pigeon, {Columba livia,) the sheep and 

 the dog. He particularly directed attention to the fact that some animals in the 

 u<ild state undergo remarkable changes ; the Black squirrel and the Red squirrel 

 for instance, while some other species of the same genus are unchangeable. 



Some animals are not less remarkable for being liable to change than others 

 are remarkable for resisting every impression from vicissitude or difference of 

 climate and other causes. For instance the Bengal tiger, Felis Tigris, is pre- 

 cisely the same in every tint, whether inhabiting the frozen shores of Lake 

 Baikal in'Siberia, or the jungle of Ceylon. The greatest extremes of climate 

 appear alike congenial to this animal. 



In the north western province of Delhi, Bishop Heber saw a shaggy Elephant; 

 and he states that in the course of one or two winters, dogs brought from Europe 

 become woolly in that region, and even horses undergo a similar change ; but 

 this tendency does not extend to the human race, for the inhabitants are remarka- 

 ble for the length and straightness of their hair. 



Dr. Morton also adverted to the fact that the wool of sheep becomes long and 

 hairy in Guinea, where human hair is naturally woolly. 



From these and many other facts he inferred that causes which produce changes 

 in the lower animals cannot change man. 



Differences in modes of life have been considered productive of changes in man. 

 But if we examine the aborigines of America, from Canada to Terra del Fuego, we 

 seek in vain for a woolly head ; men are found with skins lighter or darker in 

 color, but all are Indians in every characteristic, and this throughout a range of 

 10,000 miles. He questions whether any one ever saw a true Indian who could 

 be mistaken for a being of any other race. 



In Europe we trace families through many generations, either living in the 

 extremes of affluence or of misery, yet never does one race merge into another 

 nor does a new race rise up among them. 



Mr. W. B. Hodgson, Consul of the United States at Algiers, states there is a tribe 



of white men supposed to be derived from the lost tribes of Israel, now existing in 



the heart of the Negro territory ; yet they have acquired no negro peculiarity, 



but are remarkable for all the characteristics of the white race skin, hair and 



form. This is one of many similar examples. 



Again ; how does it happen that no Negro has ever been born as an accidental 

 variety, among the Caucasian, Mongolian or other races ? 



It is vain to seek for the origin of Negro races in morbid change. No morbid 

 change tends to perpetuity, but, on the contrary, it wears out sooner or later. 



Dr. Morton conceives that there is a constant tendency in nature to restore and 

 preserve a primitive type. A black man and white woman, or a black woman 




32 [April, 



and white man, produce a hybrid offspring, and that hybrid reproducing in turn, 

 one or other of the original types will sometimes occur in such projieny. 



In Peru some Spanish families, two or three centuries since, intermarried 

 with the Inca, or purely Indian race ; and notwithstanding no further cross with 

 the Indian stock has subsequently occurred in these families, the Indian charac- 

 teristics are said occasionally to reappear even at the present time. 



Asiatics may have landed ages ago upon this continent ; but if they did so, 

 they have all been swallowed up and lost, in the indigenous population; and no 

 unequivocal trace of them remains in our Indian population. Before the landing 

 of Columbus, as well as since, the New World has presented every possible vicis- 

 situde of climate which could be supposed to produce a negro or any other race, 

 but not an individual of such a race has ever appeared. 



Dr. M. added, that such was the effect of the blending of dissimilar types on 

 the American continent, that he could produce, from among the colored population 

 of this city, many of the diversified forms and colours that exist in Africa itself. 

 In the case of seven species of domestic fowl, Temminck has shown that five 

 out of the seven cross among each other, a,nd produce prolific hybrids, and 

 then branch out into innumerable varieties: and the varieties of the domestic 

 pigeon differ more among each other than some distinct genera of other animals. 



Domestic cattle if bred in and in, dwindle. In Paraguay it is necessary to re- 

 fresh the stock by importations from other pastures. Other domestic cattle also 

 exhibit this peculiarity of hybrids. 



If mulattoes were bred in and in, without reporting fo the parent stock, they 

 would soon become extinct. 



A circular was read from the Committee of reception of thie National 

 Pacific Rail Road Convention, now in session in Philadelphia, asking 

 permission of the Academy for the members of the Convention to visit 

 the Museum} whereupon a resolution was adopted granting the desired 

 permission.

Dr. MortoNj President, in the Chair. 



Dr. Leidy remarked that crystalline bodies had been detected in most of the 

 tissues of many plants, but that their occurrence in animal tissues v/as much 

 more rare. The deposit of earthy salts in many tissues, such as bone, enamel 

 and shell, though analogous, was not homologous with crystallization. The earthy 

 deposit in the shell of the egg of many animals is probably an instance of true 

 crystallization within an animal tissue, for in those animals which have eggs with 

 a semi-membranous shell, as many helices, &c., we can detect the carbonate of 

 lime deposited in the form of regular rhombohedrons. He stated that he lately 

 met with a remarkable instance of crystallization within animal organic cells. 

 In examining the stomach of the larva of Arctia Isabella, a Lepidopterous insect, 

 he found that the nucleus of every epithelial cell contained an octohedral crystal, 

 the axes of which measured about the l-3750th of an inch. The cells were color- 

 less, (not white,) containing some faintly granular matter, which, in many in- 

 stances, was collected into distinct rounded masses. The nuclei were round. 




1850.] 33 



ellipticaljorlenticular, transparent, and measured the l-166Gth of an inch when 

 round. The following day, upon examining some of the cells, which had been 

 preserved between two slips of glass hermetically sealed, the crystals had dis- 

 appeared, and the nuclei had become distinctly and opaquely granular. Acetic 

 acid rendered the granular matter more translucent, and brought into view the 

 nucleolus, which, not being visible the preceding day, probably served as the 

 nucleus of the crystalline body. The animal, when examined, was in a state of 

 hybernation, at which period organic activity is reduced, which would predispose 

 to the crystallization of any salt in solution in an organic cell, for it appears that 

 the frequency of the existence of crystalline bodies in the organic kingdom, is, to 

 a considerable extent, dependant upon an inverse ratio of activity of life. 



Dr. Morton then resumed the subject of the plurality of origin of 

 the human race. In evidence of its orthodoxy, and of its being in 

 accordance with a liberal interpretation of the Pentateuch, he adduced 

 the last edition of the work of the Rev. Dr. John Pye Smith, on the 

 Relations of Geology and Revelation. This author designates the^Deluge 

 as a local phenomenon, and circumscribes its limits. Geologists are in 

 general convinced that it was not universal. 



As regards the opinion that the various races of the human family 

 were primordially distinct. Dr. JMorton is convinced that the tendency 

 of investigation goes every year to strengthen it. In other words, Man 

 was aboriginally suited by his Creator for the various localities in 

 which he has placed him. Dr. M. also read some interesting quotations 

 from Dr. Pye Smith's work, in further support of this opinion. 

 Mr. White, of England, fifty years since, also maintained that the 

 plurality of the human race was in accordance with the text of Genesis, 

 and Mr. E. King strenuously takes the same ground. In 1835, Rev. Dr. 

 Thomas Arnold remarks in a letter to Archbishop Wheatley, " that he 

 fears the physiological question is not yet settled." 



Dr. Morton distinctly disclaimed any desire to enter into controversy 

 on the biblical view of the question ; but he was glad to show, from cleri- 

 cal authors, that the naked facts of zoological science, and the state- 

 ments of Genesis, are in harmony with each other.

 By Joseph Leidy, M. D. 



EccRiNA." (Gen. Nov.) Characters same as EnterobryuSjf except that it 

 divides into numerous cells at the free extremity. 



Eccriiia, longa. Filaments long and delicate, hyaline, or faintly brownish, at 

 first forming a simple curve, or a single spiral turn, and then passing in a straight 

 line to the free extremity. Peduncle very short. Frond cell usually filled with 

 globules, and a few granules, except at free end where it is usually filled with 

 granules to the exclusion of the globules. End cells as high as thirty in number, 

 at first consisting of elongated divisions of the frond cell contents, but becoming 

 distinct elliptical cells, from two to three times longer than the breadth ; content* 

 usually granular, occasionally with a few globules. End cells finally separating 

 from the parent. Length from three to seven lines, breadth l-2000th to the 

 1-5 17th in., not usually corresponding to the length. End cells l-517th to the 

 l-357th in. in length. 



Habitat. Grows in very great profusion from the mucous membrane of the 

 posterior part of the intestine of Polydesmus virginiensis. 



(Dr. L. exhibited to the Academy a preserved fragment of mucous membrane, 

 with filaments of this species six lines in length growing from it.) 



Eccrina moniliforma. Filaments hyaline or yellowish, forming a double or 

 treble spiral. Peduncle short. Frond cell filled with globules and granules, 

 except towards its free extremity, where it is filled with granular matter divided 

 into distinct and separate masses, usually a little shorter than broad, and contain- 

 ing each a globular nucleolated nucleus. Divisions progressively passing towards 

 the end into globular cells with granular contents. Divisions and globular cells 

 from 20 to 50 in number. 



Length from 1 to li lines, breadth average l-1500th in. Divisions of frond 

 cell contents and globular cells from l-1875th l-1500th in. Nucleus of cells 

 1-3750 in. 



Habitat. Gxovis in moderate quantity from the mucous membrane of the 

 intestine of 50 per cent, of Polydesmus granulatus. 



Arthromiius 7iitidus. Filaments very long, hyaline, grows usually in twos or 

 fours, pointed at the origin, rounded at the termination. Articuli very distinct, 

 length equal to the breadth of the filament. Sporuli formed within the articuli, 

 solitary, usually oblique, oval, amorphous. 



Length 1 line by l-5000th in. broad. Spores 1-7. 111th in. long, by l-12.500th 

 in. broad. 



Habitat. Grows in considerable quantity with a profusion of young of Entero- 



Exxptvo segrego. t^roc. Acad. Oct. 9, 1849. 




36 [April, 



bryus elegaiis from the mucous membrane of the posterior portion of the rectum 

 of Julus marginatus. 



Kemarks. Since I established the genus Arthromitns* I have observed the 

 formation of its sporuli. These originate in the amorphous matter of the 

 articuli, apparently by a very gradual aggregation and condensation of the 

 contents. They are always single, and usually lie oblique, and frequently 

 alternate vi'ith each other in this position in the different articuli. When 

 they first appear they are larger than when fully formed, are frequently 

 bent, or clavate in form, and very indistmct, but as they ripen they become more 

 regular, oval, distinct, and quite refractile of light. Usually they are observed 

 at the extremity of the filaments only, but frequently they are found existing in 

 the whole length of the latter. 



A species of Arthromitus, and also of Cladophytum is found in the intestine 

 of Polydesmus virginiensis. 



The Higrocrocis intestinalis found by Valentin in the Blatta orientalis, I could 

 not find in our domestic cockroach, although I found numerous simple, phytoid, 

 inarticulate filaments, growing from an oxyuris infesting this animal. 



The committee on Dr. Leidy's paper, describing some new American 

 Annelida abranchia, reported in favor of publication in the Journal. 



The following amendment to Art. 1, Chapter 6th, of the By-Laws,

 phalangeals, (including the three unguals, numbered to place together, with the

following,) very fine. 47, Tarso-metatarsal, of the Dinornis giganteus, very fine. 

 (With No. 46, the structure of the entire foot of the largest species of Moa, is 

 beautifully demonstrated. The phalangeal bones do not all belong to this meta- 

 tarsal, but they have been selected with great care by Mr, Walter Mantell, and 

 fitted together on the spot ; the type of the original is now fortunately known 

 from two perfect feet, not quite so large as the above, having been dug up, stand- 

 ing erect in the tertiary bed at Waingongoro, as if the Moa had become swamped 

 in the bog and perished. Nos. 46 and 47 arranged together according to the 

 numbers and figures attached to each bone, afford the finest illustration of 

 the foot of the gigantic Dinornis hitherto obtained.) 48, Another magnificent 

 specimen of the Tarso-metatarsal of Din. giganteus, or i7ige?is. (The re- 

 ference of separate bones to the several species assumed by Prof. Owen, must be 

 received as approximative only ; except where bones are found in apposition, (as 

 in No. 46 and 47,) for it is very probable future discoveries may show a different 

 arrangement of femora, tibia, metatarsal, &c., than that adopted in the Zoological 

 Transactions. Some of Prof. Owen's species are well marked, and will doubt- 

 less stand good ; others are doubtful.) 49, 50, Proximal phalangeal of Din. gigan-

 thioides. 65, Left do. do. 66, Femur of a very young Din. giganteus, or ingens. 

 67, Femur of Din. didiformis. 68, Do. dromioides. 69, Portion of shaft of 

 Tibia. 70, Femur of young Dinornis dromioides. 71, Sacrum of Dinornis

 (young bird). 77, Proximal part of Tibia of Dinornis giganteus. 78, Pelvis of 

 Din. giganteus. 79, Femur of do. 80, Femur of do. (The above, (73 to 80,)

Mil/ 1th. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



An extract of a letter from J. Sharpe Macleay, Esq., dated Elizabeth 

 Bay, near Sydney, 12th October, 1819, addressed to Dr. Morton, 

 stating that he had transmitted to the latter " the cast of a fossil fish, 

 illustrating the highest animal form yet discovered in the vast coal 

 measures of the Eastern coast of New Holland. The head was want- 

 ing, but from analogy it most nearly resembles the modern Lepidosteus. 

 The specimen was found at New Castle, a port about sixty miles north 

 of Sydney, and noted for its coal mines. 



Two other specimens of Sauroids of a distinct genus have been found 

 at Pararaalta, an inland town about fourteen miles from Sydney. 



These are all the remains of Vertebrata yet found in strata of an 

 earlier date than the Tertiary period." 



Mr. Macleay also proposed to exchange Silurian or carbonaceous 

 fossils, or plants and seeds of the colony, for those of this country, and 

 enclosed a list of the latter which would be desirable. The list was 

 referred to the Botanical Committee with power to act. 



Dr. Morton also presented a communication addressed to him by 

 P. A. Browne, Esq., dated Philadelphia, April 2t5, 1850, stating that 

 he had been recently engaged in making an examination of the hair 

 and portions of the scalp of some human heads, from Pachamahac and 

 from Arica and Pisco, in Peru, and on comparing them with those of 

 our modern Indians, he was prepared to demonstrate that they all be- 

 long to the same species, that viz. with cylindrical straight lank hair, 

 which issues out of the epidermis at an acute angle, but the coloring 

 matter is in the cortex, or in the cortex and intermediate fibres. 



May 21st. 

 Dr. Bridges in the Chair. 



A letter was read from Joel Y. Schelly, Esq., dated Hereford, Berks- 

 county, Pennsylvania, April 7, 1850, addressed to Dr. Leidy, announc- 

 ing that he had transmitted to the Academy all the fossil remains in 

 his possession, found in Upper Milford, Lehigh county, Pennsylvania, 

 in 1848. Some other specimens in the hands of other individuals he 

 would also endeavor to obtain for the Society. 



On motion of Dr. Leidy the thanks of the Academy wer^ presented 

 to Mr. Schelly for the collection ; which Dr. Leidy slated had been 

 received, and was now in the possession of the Society.

May 28th. 

 Dr. Bridges in the Chair. 



The Committee appointed at a meeting of the Society in January, to 

 have such alterations made in the room adjoining the i^ibrary, as would 

 adapt it to the extension of the latter, and the better accommodation of 

 the books, reported that they had performed that duty according to the 

 plan submitted to the Society, and that said room was now ready for 

 the reception of the books. 



Mr. J. D. Sergeant read a memorial, praying that a geologist be 

 attached to the party accompanying the Commissioners appointed to 

 survey the boundary of Mexico, and moved that copies signed by the 

 officers of the Academy be forwarded to both Houses of Congress; 

 which was agreed to. 



Dr. Zantzinger offered the following, which was adopted : Resolved, 

 That the thanks of the Society be tendered to Henry Bond Dewey, 

 Esq., of Para, Brazil, for the elegant collection of insects from that 

 country, presented by him at the last meeting. (See page 61.) 



ELECTION. 



Clement Biddle, Jr., Esq., of Philadelphia, and Mr. Samuel G. 

 Rosengarten, of Philadelphia, were elected Members; and Henry Bond 

 Dewey, Esq., of Brazil, was elected a Correspondent of the Academy. 



June 4/A. 

 Dr. Carson in the Chair. 



On leave granted, Mr. Vaux, on behalf of Dr. Morton, offered the 

 following resolutions. 



Resolved, That this Society has learned with sincere regret, the death 

 of their esteemed and venerable fellow member, Alexander Maclure, 

 at New Harmony, in Indiana, on the 9th of April last. 



Resolved, That his name should be indelibly recorded in the annals 

 of our Institution, as well for his various personal benefactions, as for 

 his faithful and literal fulfilment of those most important objects which 

 his brother, William Maclure, had designed, but did not live to ac- 

 complish. 



Resolved, That we further cherish the memory of Alexander 

 Maclure for the moral excellence of his character, his exacting probity, 

 and his practical benevolence. 



The resolutions were unanimously adopted. 



Mr. Vaux read from the North American and United States Gazette, 

 the following printed letter relating to the death of Dr. William 

 Gambel.* 



* Dr. Gambel'sdeath was announced ata former meeting of the Academy, 

 but the information was not then sufficiently authentic to .authorize any 

 action on the subject by the Academy.

Correspondence of the N. American and U. S. Gazette. 



Mountain House, Alta California, { 

 March 25th, 1850. J 



Messrs. Editors, I trust you will pardon the liberty 1 take in offering to the 

 citizens of Philadelphia, through your valuable paper, a tribute to the memory of 

 an eminent and worthy Philadelphian, who has fallen in this wild and far-off" 

 country. I refer to the death of Dr. William Gambel, former Secretary of the 

 Academy of Natural Sciences of your city, who left for California in the spring 

 of 1S49, takiuii the overland route, to collect specimens illustrating the natural 

 history of the Far West, and to explore, to some extent, the prominent geological 

 features of the country between the Rocky Mountains and the Great Sierra 

 Nevada. He went from Independence to the upper crossing of the Kansas with 

 a small company of gentlemen from Georgia, Florida, and Virginia. After which 

 his company joined Indiana Company, No. 1, of which I had command, and with 

 us he continued until we reached Fort Kearney, on the Great Platte. There he 

 separated from us and joined a company commanded by Capt. Boon, of Kentucky, 

 which followed the trail opened by Capt. Hudspeth's company, crossing the 

 Sierra near the head of Sacramento valley. The trials of this rugged route across 

 fearful mountains and great deserts proved too much for the Doctor's constitution, 

 and on reaching his destination in California, he was seized with typhoid fever, of 

 which he died. He had collected during his journey a large number of rare and 

 interesting specimens, by which he had added largely to the rich store of know- 

 ledge he had previously gained. His loss is as sad as it is premature, and he 

 sleeps in peace beneath the towering pines which cluster on a sunny hill side 

 stretching up from the bright waters of the Rio del Plumus. He has departed 

 early, but not unhonored, and though the afflicting dispensation will fall heavily 

 on those to whom he was endeared by ties of relationship or friendship, yet their 

 consolation will be strong in the knowledge that he fell in the midst of his hon- 

 orable pursuit of knowledge, and the earnest and zealous unfolding of his natural 

 and acquired gifts. Philadelphia owes to his memory a lasting tribute of respect 

 for his science, virtue, worth, talent, and energy. 



Very respectfully yours, 



D. B. Woods. 



Mr. Vaux then offered on the part of Dr. Morton, the following re- 

 solutions, which were unanimouslj' adopted, and the Recording Secre- 

 tary' was directed to send a copy of the same to the family of the 

 deceased. 



Resolved, That this Society has learned with deep regret, of the de- 

 cease of their esteemed associate, Dr. William Gambel, in California on 

 the 13th December last. 



Resolved^ That we cherish for Dr. Gambel the highest sentiments of 

 respect and regard, not only for his extensive and accurate attainments 

 in Botany and Ornithology, but also for the excellence of his heart, 

 his amiable manners, and his many virtues. 



Resolved, That we regard his untimely death in a distant land as a 

 painful bereavement to private friendship, and a misfortune to the inter- 

 ests of science.

June Wth. 



Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



Mr. P. A. Browne expressed his views in relation to the peculiarities 

 of the hair in man and other mammalia, and more particularly on the 

 absence of a central canal in the hair of certain races of the former, 

 on which he proposes to found specific differences. After some con- 

 versation among the members on the organization of hair, Mr. Browne 

 offered a resolution that a committee be appointed to make microscopic 

 investigations on the subject, which was adopted, and the following 

 committee appointed, viz : P. A. Browne, Prof. Haldeman, and Dr. 

 Morton. 



June ISth. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



A letter was read from the Royal Society of London, dated Somerset 

 House, March 20, 1850, returning acknowledgments for recent num- 

 bers of the proceedings of the Academy. 



Mr. Cassin read a paper entitled, ' Descriptions of new species of 

 the genera Vidua, Hyphantornis, Hirundo, Atticora, Acanthylis, and 

 Cypselus, specimens of which are in the Academy of Natural Sciences 

 of Philadelphia," which was referred to the following committee, Drs. 

 Wilson, Townsend, and Heerman. 



Mr. Moss read a description, with a figure, of a new Carpolite from 

 Arkansas, which was referred to the following committee, Dr. Bridges, 

 Mr. Conrad, and Dr. Hallowell. 



June 25th. 



Dr. Morton, President in the Chair. 



The committee to whom was referred Mr. Cassin's descriptions of 

 Birds in the collection of the Academy, read at last meeting, reported 

 in favor of publication in the Proceedings. 



Descriptions of new speeies of Birds, specimetis of which are in the collection of 

 the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. 



By John Cassin. 



Vidua Verreanxii, nobis. Vieill. Ois. Chant, pi. 37 ? 



% . Form. GeneralJy resembling Vidua paradisea, (Linn.) Swains. B. of W. 

 Af. I, pi. 11, but is larger, the two longest tail feathers taper gradually to the 

 find from near the middle of the feather, the outer (or upper) webs are very nar- 




1850] 57 



row, and they present but a slight degree of convexity when connpared with those 

 of V. paradisea. In the two specimens which I am now about to describe, the 

 bills and feet are decidedly larger and stronger. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail 15^ inches. 

 Wing 3 1-10. Tail 12 inches. 



Colors. Wide collar on posterior part of the neck (or nape) and the belly pale 

 fulvous. Breast rich glossy chesnut, thighs pale buff with some black feathers. 

 Upper part of the head, throat, under tail coverts, and all remaining parts of the 

 body black. Shorter tail feathers slightly edged with white at their tips. 



9 Without long tail feathers, whole plumage cinereous, streaked with brown- 

 ish black, pale beneath. 



Hab. Abyssinia. 



Obs. Two males and one female of this species, now in the collection of this 

 Academy, have recently been received from M. Jules Verreaux of Paris, in a note 

 accompanying which, he expresses his conviction that they are distinct from the 

 common species, (V. paradisea.) Upon examination and comparison with 

 eighteen specimens of the latter, I entirely coincide with M. Verreaux, and have 

 accordingly described it, hoping he will accept my specific name as a slight 

 tribute to his great accomplishments as a naturalist, and his enthusiastic attach- 

 ment to our favorite science. 



The species now described bears a strong general resemblance to the common 

 species, but may readily be distinguished by the different shape of the long tail 

 feathers. In the two males now before me the nuchal collar is pale, in which 

 respect they differ from the V. paradisea, and also from the plate given by 

 Vieillot, which I have little doubt, however, is intended to represent the present 

 bird. For the purpose of comparing the general appearance of the two species, 

 the plates of Vieillot and Swainson above cited are sufficient for consultation. 



Hyphantornis badiics, nobis. 



% . Form. Small for a typical species, wings medium, first quill very short, 

 almost spurious, fourth and fifth longest and nearly equal, tail rather short. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 5 inches, 

 wing 3, tail 2 inches. 



Colors. Head above and mask including eyes and extending to the breast, 

 black, middle of the belly, and tail coverts above and below bright yellow, all 

 other parts of the body bright reddish brown, (or burnt sienna brown.) Wing fea- 

 thers brownish black, externally with narrow edges of greenish yellow, and with 

 broad internal edges of pale yellow very conspicuous upon viewing the wing from 

 below. Tail greenish yellow. 



Hab. Fazogloa, Eastern Africa. 



Obs. A small species related to H. rubiginosa, (RiJpp.) and perhaps to H. 

 castaneofusca, (Less.) but appears to be quite distinct. Several specimens from 

 the Rivoli collection are now in the collection of the Academy, some of them are 

 laljelled " P. mordoreus," which I have not succeeded in finding. 



This bird may possibly be the adult of one of the plain plumaged species de- 

 scribed by Dr. Smith or Mr. Ruppel. 



Atticora hamigcray nobis. 



Form. Wings long, with the first primary longest and curved, several of the 




58 yuNE, 



shorter primaries slightly sinnated at their points on the inner webs, tips of 

 secondaries emarginate. External edge of the first primary (or edge of the wing) 

 furnished with a row'of hooks or reversed bristles very obvious to the touch and 

 discernable with the naked eye. Tail long and broad, deeply emarginate. Legs 

 slender. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail 5l in. Wing 

 4 4-10. Tail 3i inches. 



Color. Entire plumage fine black with a green gloss, inferior surface of the 

 wings and tail paler and without lustre. 



Ilab. Port Natal, Eastern Africa. 



Obs. Four specimens of this species are in the collection of the Academy, 

 several of which from the Rivoli collection were labelled " Hirundo velox, 

 Vieill." It is not the bird figured by Le Vaillant, which belongs to another 

 genus, and Is not therefore the species intended by Vieillot. 



Cypsehis lettcopygialis, nobis. 



Form. Robust, wings long, exceeding the tail, primaries slightly curved with 

 the second longest. Tail rather short, truncate, scarcely emarginate. 



Dimensions. From tip of bill to end of tail 5i inches. Wing 5*. Tail 2 

 inches. 



Colors. Rump white, throat pale, nearly white ; back and upper surface of the 

 wings and tail brownish black with a green gloss, head and entire under parts 

 dull sooty brown. Inferior tail coverts with a slight subterminal black band and 

 minutely tipped with white. 



Hah. Sumatra ? 



Ohs. This species resembles the Cypselus afRnis, Gray, but is much larger. 

 It is quite distinct from that or any other species known to me. One specimen 

 only is in the museum of the Academy, which bears a label having Sumatra as 

 the locality, and was received from Europe in a collection sent by Mr. Edward 

 Wilson. 



Acantliylis cinereocanda, nobis. 



Form. Wings very long, with the second primary longest. Tail rather short 

 with the feathers broad and the terminal acute points conspicuous, upper tail 

 coverts long and ample. 



Dime7isio7is. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail 4 inches. 

 Wing 4 8-10. Tail 1 3-l0. 



Colours. Rump, upper and under tail coverts and tail above and below pale 

 brownish cinereous, or mouse color ; shafts of the tail feathers black. All other 

 parts of the plumage brownish black, deeper and with a greenish lustre above, 

 dull and paler below. 



Hab. South America. 



Obs. The species now described resembles Acanthylis spinicauda, (Temm.) 

 PI. Enl. 726, but may readily be distinguished by the entirely black plumage of 

 the under parts and by the pale colour of the tail. Though not so large a bird as 

 the A. spinicauda, its wings are longer. Two specimens are in the museum of 

 the Academy, one of which, sent from Paris by Mr. Edward Wilson, is marked 

 as coining from South America. 




1850.] 



59 



Hirundo scapularis, nobis. 



Form. Tbat of a typical Hirundo. Wings rather long, first primary longest, 

 nearly all the prlnaaries with oblique terminal indentations, secondaries 

 emarginate. 



Dimensio7is. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail 5i inches. 

 Wing 4 3-10. Tail 3 inches. 



Colors. Scapulars and inferior wing coverts white. Entire plumage above, 

 including wings and tail, black, with a fine violet lustre, darkest upon the head, 

 beneath white with a yellowish tinge, shafts of inferior tail coverts black, fea- 

 thers on the back white at their bases, some feathers on the breast black at their 

 bases. 



Hab. Eastern Africa. 



Ohs. Appears to be allied to H. leueosoma, Swainson, but is larger, and 

 although the scapulars are conspicuously white, it has no spot on the wing. One 

 specimen only in the Rivoli collection. 



The committee on Mr. Moss' description of a new Carpolite from 

 Arkansas, reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings. 



Descriptio7i of a new Carpolite from Arkansas . 

 By Theodore F. Moss. 



Trigonocarpum Woodrttffii. 



This very perfect specimen of a Carpolite was found in a fissure filled with 

 clay, in the clay slate, ten miles north of Little Rock, Arkansas, and forty miles 

 east of the coal formation, where it is probably in place. It is now converted 

 into iron stone. 



The figure represents the fruit in its natural size, showing the pore for the 

 passage of the embryo at the base. The epicarp is three 

 lobed, and therefore the fruit belongs to the Monocotyledonous 

 tribe of plants, and is about one-eighth of an inch in thickness. 



The inner part or endocarp is striated from the circumfe- 

 rence of the pore (hilum), for the passage of the embryo. 



I have called the specimen Tri gonocarpum Woodruffii, iu 

 honor of William E. Woodruff, Esq., of Little Rock, a gentle- 

 man who has done much to advance the knowledge of the 

 mineral wealth of Arkansas.

ELECTION. 



Dr. James C. Fisher, of Philadelphia, was elected di Member, and ths 

 following were elected Correspondents of the Academy : John R. 

 Bartlett, Esq., of New York, and T. Charlton Henry, M. D. of Syra- 

 cuse, N. Y. 



August 20t/L 



Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



A letter was read from M. Alfred Malherbe, President of the Nat. 

 Hist. Soc. of Metz, France, dated May 29th, 1850, acknowledging the 

 receipt of his notice of election as a Correspondent. 



A letter was read from Dr. Franklin B. Hough, dated Somerville, 

 New York, August 12th, 1850, accompanying the donation of a col- 

 lection of minerals from that vicinity, and stating his desire to make 

 further contributions in this and other departments, if agreeable to the 

 Society. 



A paper by Mr. Cassin, describing new species of Birds of the 

 genera Paradisea, Pastor and Buceros, and intended for publication in the 

 Proceedings, was read and referred to Dr. Wilson, Dr. Townsend, and 

 Mr. E. Harris. 



A paper was read entitled, " Descriptions of ten new species of 

 Crinoidea, from the sub-carboniferous Limestone of Iowa, collected 

 during the U. S. Geological survey of Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minesota, 

 in the years 1848-9, by David Dale Owen, and B. F. Shumard, M. D.:" 

 which being intended for publication in the Journal, was referred to 

 Mr. Conrad, Dr. Wilson, and Dr. Morton. 



A paper was also read entitled, " Notice of fossil remains brought by 

 Mr. J. Evans from the ' Mauvais Terres,' or bad lands of White River, 

 150 miles west of the Missouri, by D. D, Owen, J. G. Norwood, and 

 John Evans," of which the following is an abstract : 



This remarkable collection consists of numerous teeth, fragments of bones, and 

 twenty skulls, some of which last are in an excellent state of preservation. They 

 belong to the oxdevs Rumi7ia>itia and Facliydermata. For the present, the authors 

 of the memoir propose to give only a general and provisional description, as the 

 basis of a full report on a future occasion. The follow^ing species are particularly 

 noticed. 



1. Palaeotherium ? Proutii. These remarkable remains are thus named ia 

 compliment to Dr. Prout, of St. Louis, who first noticed them in the American 

 Journal of Science and Arts. The generic characters, however, are not yet satis- 

 factorily decided. 



2. Another species is allied to Ckasropotamtcs, and still more to Hyracotherium, 

 but is probably distinct. The bones, skulls, and teeth of this animal were found, 

 with the greater part of the other remains, in a flesh-colored calcareous marl. 




t850.] 67 



Mr. Evans' reports have' traced the cretaceous formation, with its characteristic 

 fossils, from the mouth of the Iowa river to about 300 miles below the Yellow 

 Stone. In this region of country, and west 130 miles from Pierre Chouteau, (on 

 the Missouri four miles above Teton river,) Mr. Evans noticed the following 

 fossils : Nucula Hammeri ?, Ammonites Conradi, Morton, Inoceramus Crispii? 

 Inoceramus planus, Inoceramus mytilloides ?, Inoceramus Cuvieri, Nautilus De- 

 kayi, Morton, CucuUcDa vulgaris, Morton, Pholadomya occidentalis, Morton, 

 Gryphcea Pitcheri, Morton. 



Also two species of Avicula, a Lucina, a Pyrula?, several undetermined spe- 

 cies of Ammonites and Baculites, two species of Scaphites, and a Diceras ? 



On Sage creek, a southern tributary of the Chayenne, heading on the " bad 

 lands," Mr. Evans obtained three species of Inoceramus, two of Ammonites, Nau- 

 tilus Dekayi, Cucullcea vulgaris, &c. 



August 2Wi. 



Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



The Committee to which was referred Mr. Cassin's paper, read at 

 last meeting, reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings. 



Descriptions of new s-pecies of Birds of the genera Paradisea, Pastor, and 

 Bnceros, and a yrofosition to re-name others of the genera Alcyone and Hi- 

 rmido. 



By John Cassin. 



1. Paradisea Wilsonii, nobis. 



Form. Specimen about to be described probably not fully adult, somewhat 

 mutilated, skin of the hinder part of the head wanting. Plumage compact, with 

 elongated feathers from the sides of the neck, and two plumes having their origin 

 at the base of the tail, which latter are curved into circles of about one inch 

 diameter. First primary spurious, third and fourth longest and nearly equal. 

 Exposed portion of the plumage of the back, thread-like ; feathers on the belly 

 broad and truncate. Subgenerically related to Paradisea magnifica. Lath, 



Dime7isions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 7J in., 

 wing 31, tail \h inches. 



Co/o;,s. Back crimson, which color is completely enclosed by an edging of 

 black, and forms a somewhat cordate mantle. Large nuchal spot pale yellow. 

 Front and chin black. Wing coverts and quills hair brown, greater coverts and 

 primaries narrowly edged, secondaries and tertiaries broadly edged with crimson, 

 some of the more exposed tertiaries almost entirely of this color, and tipped 

 with black. Tail and coverts above and below bail brown. Ornamental plumes 

 of the tail steel blue. Elongated feathers on the side of the neck black, with 

 a beautiful coppery lustre, and tipped with bright green; Under parts from the 

 neck to the abdomen silky green, the feathers brown at their bases, and having 

 intermedial (between the brown and the green colors) triangular spots of a 

 deeper glossy green, inclining to blue upon the neck and breast; truncate feathers 

 of the sides and belly tipped with deep shining green, posterior part of abdomen 

 dull brownish black. 



Hab. New Guinea? 




68 [Aug 



Obs. This very handsome Paradise bird is one of the most valuable and inter- 

 esting of the many contributions to the collection of this Academy, made by Mr. 

 Edward Wilson, of Lydstip house, Pembrokeshire, to whom I have taken the 

 liberty of dedicating it, as a slight acknowledgment of his valuable services to the 

 cause of the zoological sciences in this country. 



This species is a congener of Paradisea magnifica. Lath., but does not resemble 

 that, nor any other known species to an extent sufficient to render special designa- 

 tion necessary. All the species are in the collection of the Academy. 



The specimen now described was obtained by Mr. Wilson in England, but bears 

 no label indicating locality. It is probably not fully adult. 



Pastor nigrocinctus, nobis. 



Form. Specimen now about to be described much mutilated, cranium de- 

 stroyed and skin of the head much injured, nearly the whole of the vfing feathers 

 and legs wanting. Feathers of the hind head somewhat elongated, exposed por- 

 tion of the plumage of the rump and tail coverts filiform, t^iil feathers broad, 

 rather abruptly terminated and slightly acuminated. Aberrant, possibly a 

 Gracula. 



Dimenaions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 8 inches, 

 tail 3 inches. 



Colors. Head (entirely?), broad band completely encircling the middle of the 

 body ; (wings ?) and tail black with a greenish metallic lustre. 



Broad band encircling the anterior third portion of the body, including breast 

 and neck above and below, and another broad band encircling the posterior third 

 portion of the body including abdomen, rump, aud tail coverts, saffron yellow, 

 paler on the under tail coverts. Bill yellow. 



Hah. New Guinea ? 



Ohs. I have seen two specimens only of this bird, one of which is in a museum at 

 Albany; the other is the property of the Academy, and is the specimen now before 

 me. Both were imported by lAx. J. G. Bell, of New York, deservedly well known 

 as a naturalist and taxidermist, by whom the species was first pointed out to me 

 as probably undescribed, and who has also had the kindness to inform me that he 

 received them with skins of Paradise birds. They are mutilated in the same 

 manner as those usually are, and have been subjected to similar methods of pre- 

 servation ; from which facts I have inferred that they may be from New Guinea. 



3. "Buceros Fisttdator, nobis. 



Form. Very similar to that of Buceros Buccinator, Temm., but is much 

 smaller. Specimen now described probably not fully adult, bill nearly simple. 



Comparative Dime7isio7is. 



B. Buccinator. B. Fistulator. 



Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail 25 inches, 17 inches. 



Wing, 12 " 9i " 



Tail, lOJ Ih " 



Colors. Very similar to those of Buceros Buccinator, Temm. Lower medial 

 part of breast, abdomen, thighs, under tail coverts, inferior wing coverts, tips of 

 secondary and tertiary quills, and tips of external tail feathers, white, all other 

 parts black with a greenish lustre. 

 Hab. Western Africa. 




1850.] 69 



Obs. Two specimens of the bird now described are in the collection, one ol 

 which presented by Mr. Edward Verreaux, of Paris, has the plumage of an adult 

 bird, though its bill is without appendages. In all other respects both specimens 

 are very similar to B. Buccinator, Temm., PI. Col. 270, but are so much smaller 

 that I cannot think it possible they are young birds of that species.] 



4. Alcyone Les-tonii, nobis. 

 ' Ceyx azurea, Less." 



" Alcedo azurea, Lath." Lesson, Voy. Coquille, L p. 690. 



Form. Much resembling that of Alcyone azurea, (Lath.) Gould B. of Aust. 

 II, pi. 25, but is larger ; the bill is much thicker and wider. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 6j in- 

 ches, wing 34-, tail \h inches. 



Colors. Generally resembling those of A. azurea, but upon the upper surface 

 of the body are of a deeper and more uniform blue. Entire plumage above deep 

 azure blue, which color extends somewhat upon the sides of the breast. Quills 

 and tail beneath brownish black, the former narrowly edged exteriorly with blue. 

 Small narine spots and another large spot on each side of the neck, yellowish 

 white. Throat nearly white, all the other under parts of the body deep fawn 

 yellow inclining to reddish on the sides. 



Hah. Havre de Dorey, New Guniea. 



Ohs. This species is described by Mons. Lesson, as above, but is quite different 

 from the A. azurea or either of the other nearly allied Australian species, being 

 decidedly larger and in all respects more robustly organized. It is not figured in 

 Voy. Coquille, though a complete description is given. 



One specimen only is in the collection of the Academy, which is another of the 

 valuable acquisitions made in Paris by Mr. Edward Wilson. 



5. H.irundo Goiddii, nobis. 



Hirundo frontalis, Gould. Proc. Zool. Soc. London 1837, p. 22, and Voy. 

 Beagle, Birds, p. 40, (1S41.) 



Obs. I propose to apply this name, Hirundo Gouldii, to the species described 

 by Mr. Gould as above in 1837; the name given by him, Hirundo frontalis, having 

 been previously applied to another species by Quoy and Gaimard, Voy. Astro 

 labe, Zoologie I, p. 204, (1830.) 



Several specimens of both species are in the collection of the Academy. 



The Committee to which was referred a paper by Drs. D. D. Owen, 

 and B. F. Shumard, describing new species of Crinoidea from the sub- 

 carboniferous limestone of Iowa, &,c., reported in favor of publication 

 in the Journal. 



A letter was read from Dr. J. H. Troschel, Professor of Zoology in 

 the University of Bonn, and present editor of the Archiv. fiir Natur- 

 geschichte, announcing the transmission to the Academy of recent 

 numbers of that work, and expressing his desire to exchange for the 

 publications of the Academy, and requesting permission to make trans- 

 lations of papers from the latter for insertion in his work. Whereupon 




70 [Aur.. 



it was on motion ordered, that the Editor of the " Archiv. fiir Natur- 

 geschichte " bo placed upon the exchange list of the Journal. 



Dr. Morton announced the late decease of Prof. Gerard Troost, at 

 Nashville, Tenn., at a very advanced age. The deceased was the first 

 elected President of this Institution.

1850.] 81 



September 3d, 1850. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair, 



A letter was read from the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institute, 

 dated Washington, August 10th, 1850, acknowledging the reception 

 of Vol. 1st., new series, of the Journal, by that Institiition. 



A letter was read from Dr. D. D. Owen, addressed to President Morton, 

 dated July 18, 1850, stating the fact as worth}- of record, that the 

 cane (Miegia arundinacea) had this year borne flowers and pro- 

 duced seed in Indiana, a rare occurrence with this plant. Mr. Nuttali, 

 in his " Genera of N. A. Plants," in reference to " M. gigantea?," per- 

 haps a variety of " macrosperma," says, " this species is supposed to 

 flower but once in 20 or 25 years." 



Mr. Clay observed that this occurrence was not confined to Indiana 

 this year, but was very extensive in the Western States. Similar facts 

 in relation to the flowering of other plants, as the Bamboo, were also 

 adverted to. 



Mr. Robert Kilvington exhibited a collection of Australian plants, 

 twenty-three in number, which he had raised from seed presented to 

 the Academy by Dr. Charles Nicholson, of Sydney. They were all in 

 a fine healthy condition, and consisted of Acacia rutifolia, A. meloxylon, 



A. , Aotus villosa, Bossiosa scolopendrium, B. prostrata, B. 



rotundifolia, Calotis , Calothamnus villosa, Callistachys ovata, 



Casuarina tenuifolia, Dillwynia ericifolia, D. phylicoides, Hibiscus 

 Richardsonii, Kennedia rubicunda, Indigofera gracilis, Leptospermum 

 australis, Pomaderris discolor, Pultenaea hirsuta, Sphcerolobium vimi- 

 neum, Lamia australis. 



September 10th. 



Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



Dr. Morton offered some remarks on the value of the word species 

 in Zoology. 



On this point there is great diversity of opinion among naturalists. Some 

 deny the law of specific distinctions at least, their arguments lead to this infer- 

 ence. Thus, Lamarck and Geoffroy St. Hilaire insist upon the uninterrupted 

 succession of the animal kingdom the gradual mergence of one species into 

 another, from the earliest ages of time ; and they suppose that the fossil animals 

 whose remains are preserved in the various geological strata, however different 

 from those of our own time, may nevertheless have been the ancestors of those 

 now in being. Sir Charles Lyell has opposed this theory with great ingenuity 

 and general success ; yet whoever will examine the facts and arguments 

 employed by its authors, maybe disposed to admit that it is not altogether devoid 

 of foundation in some exceptions to the general law of Nature. 



PROCEED. ACAD. NAT. SCI. OF PHILADELPHIA. VOL. V. NO. V. 11 




82 [Sept. 



Somewhat allied to this is the opinion of Swainson and others, that permanent 

 varieties constitute species, or in other words, that variations of climate, food 

 and treatment produce specific distinctions. 



Species is defined byBuffon, "a succession of similar individuals which re-pro- 

 duce each other." Cuvier's definition is nearly the same ; but he adds that "the 

 apparent difference of the races of our domestic species are stronger than those of 

 any species of the same genus. The fact of the s/tccession, therefore, and of the 

 constant succession, constitutes alone the validity of the species." 



An objection to these definitions arises from the fact that they apply as readily 

 to mere varieties as to acknowledged species. Certain albino animals re-produce, 

 inter se, to an indefinite extent ; such also is the case with some fanciful varieties 

 of the dog, pigeon, &c., which are capable of multiplying by the law of succes- 

 sion, and yet have no claim to specific distinction, in the restricted acceptation 

 of that term. 



I have brought together these definitions, in the first place to show that 

 naturalists are by no means agreed upon what constitutes a species, and secondly, 

 to offer some views of my own. 



As the result of much observation and reflection, I now submit a definition 

 which I hope will obviate at least some of the objections to which I have alluded. 

 Species a primordial organic form. It will be justly remarked that a difficulty 

 presents itself, at the outset, in determining what forms are primordial ; but inde- 

 pendently of various other sources of evidence, we may be assisted in the 

 inquiry by those monumental records, both of Egypt and Assyria, of which we 

 are now happily possessed of the proximate dates. My view may be briefly 

 explained by saying, that if certain existing organic types can be traced back 

 into the "night of time," as dissimilar as we see them now, is it not more 

 reasonable to regard them as aboriginal, than to suppose them the mere accidental 

 derivations of an isolated patriarchal stem of which we know nothing ? Hence, 

 for example, I believe the dog family not to have originated from one primitive 

 form, but from many. Again, what I call a species may be regarded by some 

 naturalists as a primitive variety ; but, as the difference is only in name, and in 

 no way influences the zoological question, it is unnecessary to notice it further. 



These views appear to correspond with those of Mr. Linnaeus Martin, who 

 expresses himself in the following terms : 



" We are among those who believe that, as there are degrees in the relationship 

 of species to species, some may, although distinct, approximate so nearly as not 

 only to produce tnier se, mules incapable of interbreeding, but a progeny of fertile 

 hybrids, capable of admixiiire, even to the inost 7mlimited extent 1 



Species may therefore be classed according to their disparity or affinity, in 

 the following provisional manner : 



Remote species of the same genus, are those among which hybrids are never 

 produced. 



Allied species produce, inter se, an infertile offspring. 



Proximate sjjccies produce with each other a fertile offspring. 




1850.] 83 



September 2Uh. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



After some preliminary business, the Society proceeded to an elec- 

 tion for Vice President, in place of Dr. Griffith deceased, when Dr. 

 Eobert Bridges was elected to that office. 



The Society also elected Dr. T. B. Wilson a member of the Con- 

 chological Committee, to supply the vacancy in that committee occa- 

 sioned by the decease of Dr. Griffith. 



ELECTION. 



Aubrey H. Smith, Esq., of Philadelphia, was elected a Member of 

 the Academy. 



October 1st. 



Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



Dr. Bridges presented a paper entitled " Descriptions of four new 

 species of Crinoidea, from the sub-carboniferous limestone of Iowa and 

 Illinois, collected during the U. S. Geological Survey of Iowa, &c., 

 in the years 18-^8-9. By David Dale Owen, M. D., and B. F. Shu- 

 mard, M. D. ;" being an addition to the memoir by the same authors 

 read at a late meeting of the Academy. The present paper was 

 referred to the committee having charge of the previous portion, viz., 

 Messrs. Conrad, Wilson, and Morton. 



A letter was read from the Secretary of the Lyceum of Natural 

 History, of New York, dated September 27th, 1850, stating, that a 

 parcel containing publications of several scientific societies of Lyons, 

 France, had been received by M. Grex, of NeAY York, for the Academ)'. 



Dr. Bridges read a letter from Mr. George Ord, accompanying the 

 donation of copper plates XX and XXI, of Vol. 4, 1st series, 8vo. of 

 the Journal of this Institution. On motion, the thanks of the Society 

 were unanimously voted to Mr. Ord for his liberal and valuable gift. 



Dr. Leidy read a description of a new species of Ligula (L. sala- 

 mandra?) which on motion was referred to a committee consisting of 

 Drs. Hallowell, Kellar, and Zantzinger. 



Dr. Morton, read the following extract from a letter from A. C. 

 Harris, Esq., addressed to Mr. George R- Gliddon, and dated Alexan- 

 dria, in Egypt, 6th Aug., 1850, in relation to the present existence of 

 the Ibis religiosa, in that country. 



" Upon a large sand-bank opposite to the Casr-el Sayad, I positively saw an 

 Ris on the 20th of last December. I have seen stuffed specimens brought from 

 Sennaar, and cannot be mistaken in the bird. Its shape is that of the Monuments 

 the body is grey, the head and part of the neck black, as also the feathers of 




84 [Oct. 



the tail. It was with a flock of other birds, and as it slowly left the bank of the 

 river, I remarked that there was a peculiarity in its gait. It pondered over the 

 ground as it walked with eccentric pace, as if it were measuritig angles ; and it 

 struck me that it is this trait to which Plutarch alludes, and which gave to the Ibis 

 the character of Hierogrammaticus or Geometer. If any one else has had the good 

 fortune to see this bird in its natural state, he will perhaps have noticed the 

 singularity which I have described." 



In confirmation of Mr. Harris's remark about the scarcity of the 

 real Ihis religiosa at the present day in Egypt, Mr. Gliddon observed, 

 that although he had shot over the length and breadth of the land 

 at all times of the year, he had never seen a living Ibis during 

 twenty three years residence there. The only modern specimen of the 

 Ibis he had ever seen was a dead one, offered for sale by a Moghrebbee 

 hunter at Cairo, about 1835. Mr. Harris has been familiar with 

 Egypt for twenty-seven years, and besides being a profound hierologist, 

 is a keen and observing sportsman. His experience is therefore 

 authoritative ; and a sufficient refutation of the accounts of tourists, 

 who talk of seeing Ibises on the Nile as if they were common birds 

 there confounding this with that commonest of all birds, the 

 buffalo crane, called by the Arabs Jlboo-gerdan. 



The black Ibis, though very rare, has been shot by Mr. Gliddon near 

 lake Bourlos in the Delta. Both species are still abundant above 

 Dongola. 



Dr. Morton called attention to two plates, which he exhibited, of 

 Layard's folio illustrations of the ruins of Nineveh, whereon are figured 

 the Camel (C. bactrianus,) and Dromedarj'^ (C. dromedarius,) with as 

 much distinctive accuracy as if they had been drawn but yesterday, 

 and yet they date, according to Mr. Layard, 2600 years before our 

 era, or, according to Rawlinson, more than a thousand years later. In 

 either case, they are additional evidence of the distinctness of species, 

 a point which has been disputed, simply because they are said to pro- 

 duce with each other a fertile hybrid offspring. 



The following resolution was adopted : Resolved, That a copy of 

 the Proceedings, as far as published, be presented to the Agricultural

Dr. Liedy read a paper describing several species of Entozoa, which 

 was referred to a committee on a previous paper by the same author, 

 viz., Drs. Hallowell, Keller and Zantzinger. 



Dr. Liedy also read a paper entitled " JNotes on the development of 

 the Gordius aquaticus," which was likewise referred to the preceding 

 committee. 



Dr. Morton made the following observations on the Antiquity of 

 some Races of Dogs : 



In tracing back the age of certain canine breeds and species, I chiefly avail my- 

 self of the chronology of Prof. Lepsius, which lias happily revealed the proximate 

 dates of the Egyptian monuments, and thus enabled us to refer both man and 

 animals to their respective epochs of time. 



The following facts are offered as the initiatory portion of an extended series 

 which it is my intention from time to time to bring forward. 



1. The Fox-Dog (C. lupaster.) This animal is of the middle size, with 

 erect ears and somewhat bushy tail. It appears to be the oldest dog of which the 

 Egyptians have left an effigy ; for it represents a symbol in their alphabet,* with 

 which it must be coeval, and therefore demonstrably not much less than six thou- 

 sand years old. This same dog is again represented on the paintings in the tomb of 

 Roti, at Beni Hassan, which date with the Xllth dynasty, or the 23rd century 

 B. C. ; and he can thence be traced downwards, through the successive monumen- 

 tal periods, until these cease to record the affairs of Egypt. It is also found em- 

 balmed in great numbers in various parts of that country , and lastly, it appears to 

 have been " the parent stock of the modern red wild-dog so common at Cairo and 

 the other towns of the lower country." f Clot-Bey observes that it now leads a 

 nomadic life, and generally without a master, and like the jackal and the fox, 

 frequents the confines of the desert. It does not usually associate with other dogs, 

 but is capable of re-producing with them ; but this cross-breed is of no use or 

 value. Ehrenberg, who calls this animal Ca?iis lupaster, swpposes it to have been 

 primitively a wolf; but as in its present wild state it nowhere becomes a true 

 wolf, we may more safely refer its origin to some feral stock, once and perhaps 

 yet indigenous to the region of the Nile. 



2. The Greyhound (C grams.) There are three varieties of this animal 

 represented on the monuments of Egypt; but the oldest has long, erect ears, with 

 a smooth, short (and probably cropped) tail. I first detect it in the paintings in a 

 tomb of the IlIrd dynasty, (where it occurs in several different places,) and is 

 consequently upwards of five thousand years old ; thence, I have traced it down 

 through the Vlth and Xllth dynasties, where my researches stop for the present 

 for want of the requisite leisure. But this same dog may possibly be represented by 

 the Roumelian greyhound of the present day, which, however, I know only from, 

 description. 



3. Another greyhound first appears in the tomb of Roti, at Beni Hassan, in the 

 23rd century before Christ, t It has all the characters of the pendant-eared grey- 

 hound of the present day, as figured by Buffon, but is represented with cropped

ears. Now the present Nubian greyhound, as seen in the beautiful plates of M. 

 Prisse's Oriental Album, appears to be the very same animal ; and it is a curious 

 fact, mentioned to me by Mr. Gliddon, that the Modern Nubians habitually crop 

 the ears of this dog. 



4. The third form of antique greyhound has a bushy tail. It is figured by 

 Hamilton Smith from the monuments, but I have not yet met with it, and conse- 

 quently cannot at present determine its age. A similar form, called the AJcaha 

 greyhound, is yet common in Syria and Arabia.* 



But what is not less remarkable than the permanence and vast antiquity of the 

 preceding forms, is the fact that what we call the English greyhound is figured 

 with every distinctive characteristic, even to the semi-pendant ears, on a sup- 

 posed antique statue now preserved in the Vatican at Rome. \ 



The first three of this series are probably primordial forms; but the English 

 greyhound may be a derivative from some partial intermixture, in the same man- 

 ner that the Irish greyhound is said to be derived from an infusion of the great 

 Danish dog with the common breed. \ 



5. The Bloodhound (C Sagax.) Several varieties of the stag and blood- 

 hound are very closely allied. In the tomb of Roti, at Beni Hassan, is a painting 

 representing a spirited deer-hunt, and the dogs, two of which are represented, are 

 admirable illustrations of this variety. They are common on the latter monu- 

 ments: for example, in the Grand Frocession of Thotmes III, (B. C. 1700,) where 

 several of them are associated with people and productions of the interior of Afri- 

 ca. Again, yet later, it is seen in a tomb at Gourneh, near Thebes ; and if I 

 mistake not, through various later epochs. Now if we compare the oldest of 

 the delineations viz. : those of Beni Hassan, with the bloodhounds of Africa 

 lately (and perhaps yet) living in the Tower Menagerie in London, we cannot 

 deny their identity, so complete is the resemblance of form and instinct. || 



6. The Turnspit {C. vertagus.) Wilkinson and Blainville have both ac- 

 knowledged that a variety of this dog is figured in the tomb of Roti, at Beni 

 Hassan. IT It is yet common both in Europe and Asia. 



7. The Watch Dog (C. .) Several of these animals, or at least 



their analogues, are figured in the tomb just mentioned, ** They bear a 

 striking resemblance to one figured on a Roman mosaic pavement at Pompeii, and 

 are frequently met with in the East. It is possibly this dog which represents a 

 second canine symbol in the hieroglyphic alphabet ; but the figure is too small to 

 enable me to speak with confidence.ff 



8. House Dog. (C. hybridus.) I take this identification and provisional 

 specific name, as I have also most of the others of this series, from Blainville. X\X

1850.] 87 



We find this animal also on the monunnents of the Xllth dynasty, where it 

 presents some modifications much as we see them in the present day. * 



9. TueWolt-Dog. (C. po'mera7ivs.) This animal is also well represented at 

 Beni Hassan, with all the characteristics that can be embraced in a drawing that 

 is little more than an outline, f It is also figured on an ancient Etruscan ? medal 

 of the second or third century B. C. | 



It will be observed that two of the preceding varieties of dog are coeval with 

 the earliest hieroglyphic symbols ; and as these last cannot be later than the age 

 of Menes, the first king of Egypt, we may safely date them, on the chronology of 

 Lepsius, as far back as that epoch, viz. 3893 B. C, or 5743 years from our own 

 time; but how much further, we have not, at present, even the means of forming 

 a reasonable conjecture. 



One other form the long-eared greyhound dates, as we have seen, with the 

 3rd dynasty about 3500 years B. C. Six additional forms date with the 12th 

 dynasty, which ended B. C. 2124 ; and as the tombs of Roti and Nevopth belong 

 to the reign of Osortasen Ilnd, they are placed by Lepsius in the twenty-third 

 century before Christ. 



I give these pictorial data as a part only of the series ; for of the eight hundred 

 plates announced by Dr. Lepsius as in progress of publication, but thirty-five 

 have yet reached this country ; and for these I am indebted to the kindness of that 

 distinguished scholar who has at length raised the "Veil of Isis," and given dates 

 to the hitherto chaotic Monuments of the Nile. 



The Rev. Dr. Bachman quotes Hamilton Smith to show that three thousand 

 years ago, two varieties only of the dog were known. This was excusable in a 

 naturalist who, at the time of publishing his Caiiidm, (1839,) could not have seen 

 the complete iconography of either Champolllon or Rosellini ; and again, at that 

 period the earliest sculptures and paintings were unknown, nor had the 

 series been chronologically arranged a consummation that gives them nearly 

 their whole value in a zoological sense. The Hebrew chronology ascribes the 

 Deluge to the year 2340 B. C. Now three of these dogs date nearly a thousand 

 years earlier in time, and all the rest belong to the twenty-third century before 

 our era. Col. Smith's views were in accordance with the knowledge of the coex- 

 istent time ; but any one who had taken the pains even to look over Rosellini's 

 plates, might have obtained additional information on this question. 



10. The Bull-Dog (C. molossns.) This animal is admirably figured on a 

 piece of antique Greek sculpture in the Vatican. The form and expression of 

 the head are perfectly characteristic, even to the peculiar arrangement of the 

 teeth. It is remarked by Holland in his Travels in Greece, that the Bull-dog 

 is yet the dominant variety of Albania, where it has been trained to guard the 

 flocks, and thus to take the place of the Shepherd's dog. 



11. Mastiff (C. laniarius.) I have not yet detected this dog on thelvfilotic 

 monuments ; but it is mentioned by Aristotle and seen on two ancient Greek 

 medals, one of which, that of Segestus of Sicily, dates with the 4th or 5th century 

 B.C. The other, which is of Aquila Severa, Dictator of Crete, is about two 

 centuries later. ||

12. Shepherd's Doc (C. domesticics.) The earliest effigy of this animal, 

 which is also mentioned by Aristotle, is preserved on ancient Etruscan medals of 

 unknown date. The probability is that it was familiar to man in the earliest 

 ages, and may yet be found on the Egyptian monuments. It is doubtless one of 

 the primordial forms of the canine race. 



In allusion to the illustrations derived from the monuments, Blainville truly 

 remarks that "we here see a large number of our existing breeds of dogs;" and 

 inasmuch as they have preserved their identity through such vast periods of time 

 not only in the most diversified climates, but also under the influence of the 

 greatest variety of circumstances, is it not reasonable to believe that a part at 

 least of these forms, constitute essential primeval types ? We trace them back 

 into the " night of time," and find them as distinct as they yet are in the living 

 Fau7ia; and it remains for those persons who insist that they have all been derived 

 from an aboriginal pair, to give us something more in proof than analogical rea- 

 soning, or inferences drawn from arbitrary views of the laws of Nature. 



Eut an evidence of the great antiquity of the animal we call the domestic dog, 

 and one to which I have already alluded, is the fact that it has been recently 

 found in a fossil state in two localities very remote from each other. First in 

 Germany by Schmerling, and secondly, in New Zealand by Mr. W. Mantell, (son 

 of the celebrated geologist,) who there foimd it associated with the bones of the 

 gigantic Dinomis. Now from these facts I conceive we must conclude, either that 

 some forms of this animal are primordial and independent of human domestica- 

 tion ; or, that man himself, having existed contemporaneously with these now 

 fossilized animals, claims a vast antiquity as a denizen of the earth. 



It is shrewdly observed by Azara, that if the differences among dogs 

 were the result of climate, all the dogs of each separate country should be alike. 

 To this I may add, that if they are all descended from a single primal type, they 

 ought, on resuming the wild state,^to return to this type. Yet in America, where the 

 experiment has been observed on the largest and most unequivocal scale, we see 

 no such result. In Jamaica, they have in some iustances reverted to the shep- 

 herd's dog in others, to the great Danish dog ; and this last variety is the domi 

 nant one in the wild packs'of Paraguay. In Cuba they have sometimes resembled 

 greyhounds, and in the pampas of Brazil they are more like terriers. Li other 

 words, they constantly tend to recur to that primitive element which is most domi- 

 nant in their "physical constitution ; and it is remarkable that in the old world 

 this restored type is never the wolf, although it is sometimes, as we have seen, a 

 lupine dog, owing to the physiological cause just mentioned. 



The blending of the opposite extremes of these types, and these hybrids again 

 with each other, gives rise, as every one knows, to those degenerate animals 

 known as pugs, shocks, spaniels, &c., which Cuvier justly calls " the most de- 

 generate productions," and which are found " to possess a short and fleeting exis- 

 tence the common lot of all types of modern origin." 



Among the North American Indians, the original forms are very few and closely 

 allied; whence it happens that these grotesque varieties never appear. Neither 

 have they any approximation to that marked family we call hounds; and this fact 

 is the more remarkable since the Indian dogs are employed in the same manner 

 of hunting as the hounds of Europe, Asia and Africa. Yet, this similarity of em- 

 ployment has caused no analogy of exterior form. No varieties, like those so 

 familiar in Europe, spring up among them. They are as homogeneous as the 




1850.] 89 



wolf races from whom they have descended ; and Dr. Richardson quotes Theodat 

 to show that the common Tndian dog has not materially changed during two hun- 

 dred and twenty years. Again, the same remark applies to the indigenous Alco 

 and Techicld dogs of Mexico and South America, which, before their admixture 

 with European breeds, conformed to the types or species from whence they 

 sprung, without branching into the thirty varieties of Buffon, or the sixty of 

 Brown. The dog of New-Caledonia, in the western regions of Arctic America, 

 cannot be regarded as an exception, for he is also a lupine animal, although too lit- 

 tle is known of him to enable us to suggest his relative position to the other 

 American races- The Indian dog of Florida partakes largely also of the wolf, 

 and is supposed by Hamilton Smith to be intermediate between the common grey 

 wolf (C. occide7itaIis') and the Newfoundland dog, C. palmauis. And finally, the 

 latter animal, which belongs also to the same great dog family, is by some natural 

 ists^regarded as a cross between the Esquimaux dog and some exotic breed. To 

 this latter question I have not yet given attention. 



What is true of forms is equally true of instincts. 



"It is undoubtedly true (observes Sir. C. Lyell)that many new habits and 

 qualities have not only been acquired, in recent times, by certain races of dogs, 

 but have been transmitted to their offspring. But in these cases it will be obser- 

 ved that the new peculiarities have an intimate relation to the habits of the ani- 

 mal in a wild state, and therefore do not attest any tendency to departure, to an 

 indefinite extent, from the original type of the species." 



The author then instances a peculiar mode in which a certain breed of dogs 

 attack the deer on the platform of Santa Fe, in Mexico, and adds, that other Euro- 

 pean hunting dogs, though of superior strength and general sagacity, are destitute 

 of this instinct, and are often, in consequence, killed by the deer. 



I explain this phenomenon, not on the supposition of a new, but of a latent in- 

 stinct, which circumstances have merely developed ; and as by crossingdissimilar 

 species or varieties of dogs, we obtain the blended and opposite lineaments of both, 

 so, by the same process, we may combine a double or modified instinct. 



In view of the preceding facts, I continue to regard the great canine race of the 

 old and new world as constituted of many species of primordial dogs ; of three, at 

 least, (and perhaps more) species of wolves; of some accessions from the fox- 

 tribe, and a less certain infusion of the jackal. The wolves that appear to have 

 principally contributed to this protean family, are the Canis lupus of the old 

 world, and the C. occidentalism or common grey-wolf, and the C latrans ox 

 prairie-wolf of America. The evidence of the fox-tribe are most conspicuously 

 shown in the Aguara dogs of more southern latitudes.

A letter was also read from J. A. Grex, Esq., addressed to the Libra- 

 rian, dated New York, October 3, 1850, transmitting the above works, 

 and acknowledging the reception of a copy of the Journal, Vol. 1, new 

 series, and of a copy of the Proceedings, for the Agricultural Society 

 of Lyons. 



Dr. Leidy presented two papers, one describing two new species of 

 Infusorial Entozoa, and the other entitled "descriptions of somenema- 

 toid Entozoa infesting insects," both of which were referred to the 

 committee having charge of previous communications by Dr. Leidy 

 read at late meetings of the Society, viz., Drs. Hallowell, Keller, and 

 Zantzinger. 



Dr. Leidy also made the following observations on two new genera 

 of mammalian fossils, which he designates under the names of Eucro- 

 taphus Jacksoni, and Archaeotherium Mortoni : 



The two fragments of mammalian crania, which I exhibit this evening to the 

 Academy, are part of those specimens a short time since presented to our Cabinet 

 by Mr. Joseph Culbertson, of Cumberlandj Co., Penna., whose son obtained 

 them from that region of country, in the vicinity of Fort Laramie on the Platte 

 river, known as the " mauvais terres," or " bad lands," a locality, which, 

 according to recent researches made by Dr. John Evans, is rich in such 

 remains. Both fragments belong to new genera of mammalia. The smaller 

 of these I have named Eucrotaphus, on account of the comparatively very large 

 size of the temporal bones. It consists of the central portion only of the cranium, 

 and is a little longer than the corresponding portion of the skull of the beaver 

 (Castor fiber.) In general outline it resembles the posterior part of the cranium 

 of the American mink, (Mustela lutreola) or more particularly that of the opos- 

 sum, (Didelphis virginiana;) being broad posteriorly, cylindroid anterior to the 

 ossa tempora, but is not as bulging at the sides as in the latter mentioned 

 animals. 



The boHes still existing in the specimen consist of the right temporal, except 

 its zygoma and posterior superior portion ; a portion of the left squamous bone ; 

 the middle portion of the ossa parietalia, ossified into one, except the sagittal 

 crest ; the right para-mastoid, or paroccipital process, except the tip, with a 

 small fragment of the occiput above it ; the posterior sphenoid, somewhat 

 mutilated ; a fragment of the presphenoid ; and a fragment of the basioccipital. 



The most remarkable characteristics of this head are: first, the comparatively 

 enormous size of the squamous portion of the ossa tempora; second, the great 

 advancement of the ossa parietalia ; * third, the deep groove in the ossa parietalia 

 iust in advance of the squamous suture ; fourth, the strength of origin of the 

 zygoma ; and fifth, the form of the glenoid cavity. 



I for some time hesitated before I applied this name to the symmetrical bone 

 occupying the upper part of the cranium. I thought at first it was the frontal 

 extending very far back, but upon considering the advanced position of the squa- 

 mous portion of the temporal bone, and observing in the Erinaceus ecaudatus, 

 a considerable prolongation forward of the ossa parietalia, I concluded that it 

 belonged to the latter category. 




1850.] 91 



It has been frequently remarked in works on anatomy, that in man, the squa- 

 mous portion of the temporal bone enters into the construction of the cavity of 

 the cranium comparatively more than in any other animal, but in the fossil before 

 us we find it to be comparatively much greater than in man, for although the 

 cranium is but little larger than that of the beaver, yet the squamous portion of 

 the temporal bone in it measures over two inches in breadth antero-posteriorly, 

 and one and three-fourths of an inch at its highest point. The summits of this 

 portion of the two bones are not more than seven-tenths of an inch apart at the 

 top of the head. The exterior surface of the squamous bone is very slightly con- 

 vex, nearly flat, and inclines at an angle of about 50. It is bounded postero- 

 inferiorly by a strong, projecting ridge, the superior root of the zygoma, which 

 commences almost vertically above and a very little behind the meatus audito- 

 rius externus. The origin or commencement of this ridge indicates considerable 

 advancement of the squamous bone. Just within the ridge posteriorly on a line 

 with the meatus auditorius externus, is a large round venous foramen, the direc- 

 tion of which is downwards and inwards. 



The base of the zygoma is remarkably strong, its direction being at first almost 

 directly outward. The glenoid cavity is of unusually large extent, even greater 

 than that of most known Ruminantia, and is placed immediately beneath tne 

 base of support of the zygoma, more like in man and the quadrumana than in other 

 animals. In its direction it is transverse, with an inclination from within outward 

 and a little upward. Posteriorly it is bounded by a comparatively enormous 

 tuberosity separating it from the meatus auditorius externus, which at its longest 

 part internally measures 7-lOths of an inch from the floor of the meatus, 

 i an inch in thickness at the base, antero-posteriorly, on a level with the 

 bottom of the glenoid cavity, and over 6-lOths of aninchtransversly. Anteriorly 

 the glenoid cavity is bounded by a broad transverse ridge, about two lines higher, 

 anterior to which is a large inferior concave surface extending inward and for- 

 ward to the root of the pterygoid processes and the spheno-orbitar foramen, 

 bounded on the exterior of the latter by a projecting ridge of the alisphenoid. 

 Posterior to the posterior glenoid tuberosity, and the superior root of the zygoma, 

 is a nearly vertical triangular excavation, bounded posteriorly by the mastoid 

 and para-mastoid processes, and containing the meatus auditorius externus bounded 

 below by a strong, semicircular auditory process. In a groove between the latter 

 and the post-glenoid tuberosity, is placed a second small tuberosity or ridge about 

 1 line in length. Continuous with the groove just mentioned around the base 

 of the posterior glenoid tuberosity internally, is a deep fissure, having at its bottom 

 two glenoidal foramina. Bounding the fissure on the inside, is a large, compressed 

 globular auditory bulla, measuring about 7-lOths of an inch vertically, and 

 antero-posteriorly, and 6-lOths of an inch transversely. Posteriorly it abuts 

 against the para-mastoid process, and antero-externally it joins the alisphenoid by 

 a prominent ridge just within the suture, separating the alisphenoid from the 

 squamous bone. Poslero-externally, bounded posteriorly by the para-mastoid, 

 and externally by the auditory process, is a deep vertical pit at the bottom of 

 which is a round basis of support for the styloid process of the temporal bone. 

 Antero-internally to the auditory bulla, between it and the basisphenoid and 

 alisphenoid, is a large oval pit, the foramen lacerum anterius, and the caroticum 

 combined. Anterior to this, placed in the alisphenoid between the auditory 




92 [Oct. 



bulla and the root ol' the pterygoid processes is the foramen ovale. The latter 

 mentioned basis of support to the pterygoid processes is a triangular prominence, 

 and placed immediately on a line with it in front is a large round spheno-orbitar 

 foramen. The basisphenoid is cylindrical in form, a little over an inch in length, 

 and joins the presphenoid on a line with the spheno-orbitar foramina. The 

 mutilated commencement of the presphenoid in the specimen is alone sufficient 

 to indicate that it undergoes little diminution in diameter from that of the basi- 

 sphenoid. The basioccipital is also cylindroid in form, a little broader than the 

 basisphenoid and articulates with the latter on a line with it. The para-mastoid 

 process or paroccipital joins the mastoid process, and affords an abutment poste- 

 riorly to the auditory bulla; it is rough and strong, and in the specimen descends 

 two-thirds the length of the latter process, the tip being broken off. The ossa 

 parietalia, ossified into one symmetrical bone, in'advance of the ossa tempora are 

 nearly cylindrical and antero-inferiorly join the alisphenoid. Between the ossa 

 squamosa, the two at their narrowest portion measure only 7-lOths of an inch 

 across. They are surmounted by a strong sagittal crest with a broad base, 

 which in the specimen has been broken away. Laterally in advance of the 

 squamous suture, is a remarkable and vertical, moderately deep and broad groove, 

 the office of which I cannot conjecture. The squamous suture partakes of the 

 serrated form. 



Measurements. From one lateral groove of the parietalia to the other measures 

 1 and 7-lOths of an inch ; the distance between the glenoid cavities, 1 and 

 3-lOths inch ; from the posterior face of the posterior glenoid tubercle to the anterior 

 boundary of the anterior glenoid tubercle is 1 and 2-lOths inch; from one foramen 

 ovale to the other 4-10th3 of an inch. 



Remarks. From the very great strength of the base of support of the zygo- 

 matic process ; the comparative size and concealed position of the glenoid 

 cavity; the great size of the posterior glenoid tubercle; and the great extent of 

 the temporal fossa, (for although it is shortened by the very rapid ascent of the 

 superior root of the zygoma and advancement of the occciput, yet it is increased 

 in extent by the very great vertical development of the squamous bone, and in 

 depth by the comparatively depressed or flattened surface of the latter,) the 

 Eucrotaphus has been endowed with very great power in the muscles of mastica- 

 tion and great freedom of movement in the articulation of the lower jaw. 



The position of this genus I have not been able satisfactorily to determine 

 from the specimen, and we must wait, therefore, until other parts of the cranium 

 of the animal are found before we can be able to detect its true place among the 

 orders. 



The species I have named Eucrotaphus Jacksoni, in honor of my esteemed 

 friend Dr. Samuel Jackson, the eminent teacher of the Institutes of Aledicine in 

 the University of Pennsylvania. 



The second fossil fragment ,which I have named Archaeotherium, appears to have 

 belonged to an animal not remotely allied to the Anoplotherium. The specimen 

 is part only of the face, consisting of the middle portion of the left os maxillare- 

 superius, with the corresponding portion of the palate process, containing two 

 premolar teeth and the alveolus for a third, a fragment of the upper part of the 

 right OS maxillare superius, the central, portion of the two ossa nasi, and the an- 

 terior extremity of the left os mala. In general form this part of the face is pro- 

 longed like that of the Anoplotherium, and in size was at least one-half greater 

 than the A. commune. 




li^nO.] 93 



The anterior of the two teeth in the fragment appears to be the first premolar, 

 corresponding to that tooth in the Anoplotherium by its double fang. The body 

 of the tooth is not so broad as in the latter, and is more conical. It is convex 

 externally from side to side, and the base of the enamel is elevated, rounded, and 

 deeply emarginate at the position corresponding to the separation of the fangs, 

 but it projects at no place beyond the general surface of the crown except poste- 

 riorly where it forms a slight ledge or heel. Interiorly the general surface is 

 convex, but it rather forms a central rounded longitudinal prominence from which 

 the surface passes off slightly concave posteriorly and to an elevated line at the 

 antero-interior border of the tooth. The enamel has been worn off the end and 

 along its posterior border. The second premolar is implanted in the alveolus by 

 three fangs, two externally and the other internally. The body of the tooth is 

 cuboidal, but is greater in its transverse measurement than antero-posteriorly. 

 The external face is convex from side to side, and is not so long as that of the 

 first premolar. The enamel base is strongly emarginate between the fangs, is 

 prominent, rounded, and projects into a narrow edge anteriorly and posteriorly 

 about 2J lines below its edge. The anterior surface is directed obliquely inward 

 and forward. The crown has been worn down leaving exposed a large, trans- 

 versely oval islet of dentine, which is continuous with a similarly exposed sur- 

 face antero-externally. The posterior surface is nearly transverse, and is worn 

 into a concave depression from the pressure of the succeeding tooth in the row. 

 The fangs are large and strong ; the antero-external is implanted in the jaw 

 obliquely upward and forward, and the poslero-external vertically ; the interior 

 is larger than the other and is placed on a line posterior to the antero-external 

 fang. 



The interspace between the first and second premolars is triangular, and from 

 the attrition upon the posterior surface of the former and anterior of the latter, 

 has been occupied, in a state of rest, by the body of the first premolar of the 

 inferior maxilla. 



Posterior to the second premolar, the sockets alone for the three fangs of the 

 third premolar exist in the specimen. 



The surface of the superior maxillary bone is convex from above downwards. 

 The infra-orbitar foramen, from a smooth notch existing in the specimen, appears 

 to have been placed at_^the junction of the superior maxillary with the malar 

 bone. The palatine process is 3 lines in depth from the edge of the alveolus. 

 The ossa nasi are transversely convex. 



Measurements. The heigh th of the superior maxillary bone from the lateral 

 nasal suture to the edge of the alveolus on a line with the second premolar, is 3i 

 inches ; breadth of os nasi on same line f of an inch ; breadth of first premolar at 

 base externally \\ inches; transversely i an inch; second premolar antero-posteri- 

 orly ^ of an inch ; transversely f of an inch ; heighth of face from middle nasal 

 suture to the roof of the mouth on a line with the first premolar 2 J inches, on a 

 line with the third premolar 3 inches.

There appear to be some peculiarities, not readily accounted for, in the periods 

 of Rainy and Dry seasons upon the Isthmus of Panama, at points which are not 

 very far distant from each other, on the same coast. 



Thus, the rainy season at Escribanos, in the Province of Veragua, we under- 

 stand, is the reverse of that at Chagres, which place is situated at only sixty or 

 seventy miles distance. 



At Chagres, the dry season begins in December and ends in May , and the 

 principal rainy months are those between May and November. 



On the other hand, at Escribanos, the most rainy months are those which 

 extend from November to the end of March. The inhabitants at this time are 

 confined to their houses and have few opportunities of getting out of their doors. 

 What is called X]\edry season in this vicinity, is from April to the end of October. 

 Still, storms and showers occur almost daily in those months; and, in reference 

 to the entire year at Escribanos, we remember the somewhat vague remark of 

 the French Negro proprietor there " it rains every time." 




1850.] 95 



This constant progression of vast nnasses of vapor, of copious showers, and 

 successive thunderstorms, along the mountainous but broken range of the Isthmus, 

 appears to be chiefly from the equator, northward. 



More than forty years ago, the celebrated Humboldt offered an explanation 

 of the causes which occasioned the insupportable heat and dryness of the Old 

 World, within the limits of the torrid zone, and the comparative coolness and 

 continued humidity of the same parallel on the New Continent. These views 

 are repeated in the same author's recent work on the " Aspects of Nature." I 

 may be permitted to give the substance of them here. 



In the sandy deserts of Africa, the vertically ascending column of warm air 

 prevents the vesicles of vapor from being dissolved. The more complete the 

 absence of vegetation and the more the sand is heated, the greater is the height 

 of the clouds, and the less can any fall of rain take place. Thus, in deserts, the 

 want of rain and the absence of vegetation, act and react upon each other. It 

 does not rain, because the naked, sandy surface, having no vegetable covering, 

 becomes more powerfully heated by the solar rays, and thus radiates more heat ; 

 and the absence of rain forbids the desert being converted into a steppe or grassy 

 plain, because without water no organic development is possible. 



On the contrary, in the New World, beneath the torrid zone, among other 

 causes that tend to create a cooler and moister climate, are enumerated the 

 impenetrable forests which occupy the alluvial plains which are situated immedi- 

 ately beneath the equator; protecting with their shade the soil beneath from the 

 direct influence of the sun beams, and exhaling in the interior of the country, at 

 a great distance from the mountains and from the ocean, vast quantities of moist- 

 ure, partly imbibed and partly elaborated. It is to the same causes that we are 

 to attribute the luxuriant vegetation, the magnificent forests, and that abundant 

 leafiness by which the New Continent is peculiarly characterized. 



Dr. Bridges presented a paper from Mr. James Deane, of Connecti- 

 cut, on the " Fossil Foot-prints of Connecticut River," intended for 

 publication in the Journal. Referred to Drs. Bridges, "Wilson, and 

 Leidy. 



Dr. J. K. Townsend read a paper describing a new species of 

 American Wolf, (Lupus gigas, Townsend, the giant wolf of N. America:) 

 which, being intended for publication in the Journal, was referred to

 T. stated that the skin and skull of the animal described in his paper, 

 were in the possession of the Academy, and would be mounted at an 

 early period.

Contrilutions to Hehniiithology . 

 By Joseph Leidy, M. D. 



1. LiGULA Tritonts. Body ribbon-like, thin, translucent, nearly smooth, 

 faintly yellowish white, posteriorly obtusely rounded. Head thickened, rounded, 

 transversely corrugated, yellowish; extremity triangularly rounded, laterally 

 compressed, front and back, with a short, longitudinal, contracted depression. 



Whole length 1 in. 9 lines; breadth of body l-3d line, thickness l-12th line; length 

 of head 1 line, breadth l-4th line, thickness l-9th line. 



Habitation and Remarks. This species was sent to me by my friend Prof. 

 S. F. Baird, of Carlisle, with the note " Found embedded in the muscles of the 

 back of Triton (Cynops) dorsalis." It is the smallest species which has as yet 

 been discovered, and^he first among batrachian reptilia. The specimen sent to 

 me consisted of two fragments of the same individual preserved in alcohol. 

 Examined beneath the microscope it presented no trace of articulation or interior 

 definite organs. 



2. Pentastomum Didelphidis Virginianm, Body subcylindrical, curved one 

 third or one-half a circle, dorsum convex, bentrum concave, posteriorly narrowed 

 and constricted a short distance from the extremity, which is rounded. Color 

 white, opaque. Composed of forty or fewer annulations. Head posteriorly con- 

 vex, anteriorly plain or slightly concave; mouth nearly round; hooks simple, 

 situated in a curved line of which the mouth forms the centre. 



Whole length 3 to 5 lines, breadth 3-5th of a line ; annuli generally l-80th inch 

 wide ; mouth l-200th inch in diameter ; hooks l-200th inch long. 



Habitation and Remarks, I found 9 individuals of this entozoon, in C shaped 

 cysts, the circle being 2 lines in diameter, imbedded in the liver just beneath the 

 peritoneal surface, in Didelphis virginiana. It may probably be the Pentastomum 

 subeylindricum of Diesing,* which was found in cysts upon the liver of two South 

 American species of Didelphis, and several other animals, but the largest of 

 those found in our D. virginiana, is equal only to the smallest of P. subeylindricum, 

 and has not more than one-half the number of annulations.

iVdCM OH ths Devdfmimt of tke Goniitu aqnatietu. 



Bj JOSZTU LillDT. M. D. 



Jnst fbor years ago I exhibited to the Academy a mass of living lair-worms or 

 Gocdias aqvaticits, coosistii^ of fourteen individuals strangely knotted together, 

 mad recalling the appropriateness of the Linnean name. 



It is a vulgar opinion that the Gordins is a horse hair which has become vivi- 

 fied from maceration for several weeks in a spring or pool of fresh water, an error 

 which has probably arisen from their frequently being found in water oiling a 

 wsgon rut, or the drinking trough of a horse. I have even been informed by 

 some persons, though by those not given to observe such matters, that they had 

 perceived the direct transmutation of horse lairs into writhing worms, and I was 

 at one time so silly as to be led to try the experiment, with what success it is 

 oDBecessary for me to state. 



The Gordii alluded to in the mass, were blackish-brown in color, from 

 6 to 10 inches in length, and most of them had attached to the posterior 

 extremity of the body a long, white, opaque cord, in several instances nearly as 

 loi^ and as thick as the worms themselves. These cords some of the members 

 Doay recollect I pointed oat at the time as being strings of the ova of the Gordii, 

 but I then was not so well acqnainted with the history of the Gordins as at pre- 

 sent ; that is to say, I did not know that we have no knowledge whatever of its 

 origin or development, and although through cariosity I traced for a few days the 

 development of the nbryo in ovo, yet I did not do it with that care which its 

 importance demanded. Bat however imperfect have been the observations made> 

 with this acknowledgmeot, I have thought it would be well to record them, with 

 tiie hope that they may not only throw a>me light upon the obscure nature of the 

 Gordias, hot also lead others to the discovery of a similar opportunity of investi- 

 gating this animal nnder noore favorable circumstances of locality and informa- 

 tion. The observations I have withheld for a length of time in the hope that I 

 mi^^ be able to veriiy or correct them, but failing to do so to the present time, 

 J new rdoetantly pat them forth from my notes taken at the time. 



The white cords before mentioned consisted of numerous oval ova closely

aggregated together. These when examiBed beneath tibe microseope, aa flie first 

 day after I obuined theoi, exhibited a triiite, gnnalar yolk divided into foar 

 globular massses connected together and snrroimded by a transparent albumoi. 

 Each mass contained in its centre a clear cell or reside. On the second day the 

 separation annong the yolk masses was less distinct and upon the third day the 

 whole had onited into one oTal, finely granular body, and the interim resides 

 had disappeared. The fourth and fifth days no perceptible change was obserra- 

 ble. From the sixth to the ei^th day the yolk had become conical in Chid, aad 

 upon the ninth day the base of the cone exhibited a cleft or fissure whidi by lie 

 tenth day Had extended two thirds the length of the mass. Daring the whole of 

 this period the yolk retained its granalar character and was motionless. Upon 

 the eleventh day it resembled a cylinder doubled upon itself, or the outline of the 

 embryo bad been forward, and one extremity of it, corresponding to the head had 

 become translucent from a solution of the granular matter within. The other or 

 tail end was subacute. The twelfth day the translucency had extended itself in 

 the interior part of the embryo, the extremity of which had advanced beyond the 

 others and presented an emargination communicating with an orifice opening into 

 a canal visible in the interior, and Crom the edge of the extremiry was developed 

 a circle of short filaments which projected downwards and oatwaids. From the 

 thirteenth to the fifteenth day the granular matter had entirely undergone solotioa 

 within the anterior half of the embryo, and the latter had becMne somewhat 

 dilated. The interior canal was also more distinct, and the bordering filaments of 

 the extremity were larger. In the coarse of the sixteenth to the eighteenth day the 

 translucent half of the animal was separated &om the other by a constriction, and 

 the canal in the interior presented at its anterior portion a clavate tubular body, 

 the free end of which projected from the oral aperture. The extremity of the 

 hfead was surronnded by a reflected collar from the free border of which projected 

 tiic filamentary appendages. The posterior half of the embryo was still grs^i:;.ir 

 in appearance, but bad become rounded and somewhat dilated at the extremirr. 

 From the nineteenth to the twentieth day the embryo alternately retracted and 

 ]Kt>tnided the tentacolar or filamentary aj^ndages, and the integament of the 

 anterior half of the body appeared to be getting annulated, which was dis: 

 80 by the twenty-first day. The granular matter in the poster: rr -^- 

 body was also undergoing solution from the periphery towards the : . _: 



its posterior part there appeared several large oil globules. On the rwenry- 

 second day the annulations of the anterior half of the body were ve : 

 posterior half was also becoming annulated, and near its extremitv __ _ ,; 



time observed an anal orifice and one to four small ejMdennal spines. On the 

 twentr-fourth day, the tubular clavate organ before mentioned, : 

 anterior pan of the alimentary canal was alternately protruded an*! ; r 

 proboscis. The proboscis when ftiUy protruded brooght into view a: r 

 second circle of tentacular filaments within the first. On the twenrv-sbc: 

 the embryo when pressed from the egg progressed forward br . 



rior half of its body from side to side, acd it alternately prot" 

 the proboscis and the two circles of tentacular filaments. V 

 organs were retracted, the head presented a truncate or depressed surface, and in 

 their protrusion the extremities of the outer cirde of tentacvLe and the end of die 

 proboscis first became visible ; as these advanced the secood circle o taitacolz 

 ^ipeared, and when the proboscis was entirely protxaded, the outer tentKoIs

were deeply reflected upon the outside of the body, and the inner circle projected 

 obliquely outward and upward. The proboscis was clavate in form or cylindri- 

 cal and moderately dilated at its free end, and more so at its base. The follow- 

 ing six days no perceptible change was observable in the development of the 

 animal, and after this the eggs showed evident appearances of decay, and I gave 

 them no further attention.

The Committee on the following paper by Mr. Cassin, read at last 

 meeting, reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings. 



Dtscriptio7is of new species of Birds of the Genera Tarns, Linn.; Emberiza, 

 Linn.; Carduelis, Briss.; Myiothera, III.; and Leticonerpes, Sw., specimens 

 of which are in the collection of tlie Academy of Natural Sciefices of Phila- 

 delphia, 



By John Cassin. 



1. Parus annexus, nobis. 



Form. Crested; bill strong, conical; fourth and fifth quills longest and equal, 

 wings and tail rather long, crest pointed. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin) from tip of bill to end of tail about 5 

 inches, wing 2 J, tail 2i inches. 



Colors. Sex unknown. Anterior feathers of the crest black at their bases and 

 cinereous at their tips, the most elongated of the succeeding entirelyblack, others 

 margined with white, shorter occipital feathers, black ; chin and throat black. 

 Wide line from above the eye running into the crest, thence around upon the side 

 of the neck, white. Line commencing behind the eye, running thence around 

 and uniting with the space of the same color upon the throat, black, cheeks 

 white. Entire superior surface cinereous, tinged with olive, quills and tail 

 feathers brownish black, primaries narrowly edged externally with white, 

 secondaries and tail feathers edged externally with ashy olive. Body beneath 

 ashy white, darker upon the breast. Bill black. 



Hai. Texas, upon the Rio Grande, discovered by Mr. John Woodhouse 

 Audubon. 



Obs. This very remarkable species, discovered in Texas by a son of the illus- 

 trious naturalist of the same name, is marked upon the head more like the P. 

 eristatus of Europe than any other American species yet known. It does not 

 resemble that species in any other character, however, being more strictly 

 related to P. bicolor, Linn, and P. inornatus, Gamb., and like them belonging to 

 the genus Lophophanes, Kaup. 



2. Partes atricristatns, nobis. 



Form. Crested, wings and tail rather long. Crest pointed as in P. bicolor, 

 Linn., bill strong, conical. Specimen now described not in mature plumage. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 5 inches, 

 wing 21, tail 2i inches. 



Colors. Sex unknown. Crest black, front and under parts of the body ashy 

 white, flanks ferrugineous ; entire superior surface cinereous, darker upon the 

 wings and tail, and inclining to olivaceus upon the back. Bill and legs black. 

 Shafts of primaries reddish at their bases, those of the tail feathers white beneath. 



Hab. Texas, on the Rio Grande, discovered by Mr. John Woodhouse 

 Audubon. 



Obs. This species is of the same general form and color as P. bicolor, Linn. 

 and P. inornatus, Gamb.; smaller than the former, but about the sizeof the latter. 

 It may be easily recognized by its black pointed crest and white front, which, so 

 far as I know, are peculiar chaiacters. This species, like the preceding, was 

 discovered in Texas by Mr. Audubon, and belongs to the same genus. 




104. [Oct. 



3. Eniberiza bilineata,, nobis. 



Form. Bill strong; wings short, with the second, third and fourth primaries 

 longest and nearly equal, some of the secondaries emarginate. Legs and feet 

 rather long. Aberrant, may not belong to this genus. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 5 inches, 

 wing 2 and 4-lOths, tail 2 and 2-lOth inches. 



Colors. Sex unknown. Line from the nostril running above the eye towards 

 the occiput, and another from the angle of the lower mandible running upon the 

 side of the neck, white, space between those lines including the nares and 

 plumage under the eye and the ears, nearly black. Throat from the base of the 

 bill, black, which color is bounded on each side by the white lines from the angles 

 of the lower mandible, and continues to a somewhat rounded point upon the breast. 

 Head and body above dark cinereous, inclining to brownish upon the back and 

 wing coverts. Quills brownish. Tail brownish black, external feathers having 

 their outer webs pure white and tipped with the same color, the brown color of 

 these feathers extending narrowly along the shafts into the white tips. Body 

 beneath white, tinged with cinereous. Bill bluish horn color. 



Hab. Texas, on the Rio Grande; discovered by Mr. John Woodhouse Audubon, 



Obs. This is one of the most remarkable finches yet discovered in America, 

 and is quite unlike, even in general appearance, any other species of this country 

 with which I am acquainted This bird was also brought from Texas by Mr. 

 Audubon. 



4. Emleriza Belli, nobis. 



Form. Wings rather short, second, third and fourth quills longest and nearly 

 equal. Tail and legs rather long. 



Dimensions. % Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 5i 

 inches, wing 2|, tail 3 inches. 



Colors. % Head and neck above cinerous, shading into olive upon the back 

 and neck. 



Frontal spots on each side of the base of the bill, (scarcely united) narrow 

 ring around the eye, and entire under surface white. Edge of the wing at flexure, 

 yellow ; superior wing coverts brown tinged with ferruginous, quills and tail 

 brownish black, nearly all the feathers of both narrowly edged with whitish, 

 most apparent upon both webs of the external tail feathers. Conspicuous spot 

 upon the breast, nares, and lines from the external angles of lower mandible 

 running downwards upon the sides of the neck, deep brownish black. Flanks 

 tinged with rufous and with a few longitudinal stripes of brown. 



% Slightly smaller, flanks and interior tail coverts more tinged with rufous. 



Hab. California, near Sonoma and San Diego; discovered by Mr. John G. 

 Bell. 



Obs. This species resembles in rather a remarkable degree the Emberiza 

 hypochondria, D'Orb. Voy. Merid. Ois- pi. 45, fig. 1, but is smaller and without 

 the deep castaneous flanks of that species. In the bird now described, the dark 

 spot upon the white breast is a striking feature, and is much more strongly pro- 

 nounced than in any other with which I am acquainted. 



I have named this species in honor of Mr. John G. Bell, of the city of New 

 York, a gentleman possessing a very extensive knowledge of natural history, and 

 whose attachment to the pursuit of which, induced him to make the visit to Cali- 

 fornia, which resulted in the discovery of this and other iateresting birds. 




1850.] 105 



The following is Mr. Bell's note relating to this species : This bird T shot 

 first near Sonoma, and afterwards at San Diego ; its habits much resemble those 

 of the painted bunting, [S. ciris.) I observed several of them amongst the worm- 

 wood at the edge of the hills, sitting on the tops of the small bushes, singing, and 

 when disturbed would dart downwards. The song is quite unlike that of any of 

 our finches, rather low and plaintive, and perhaps most resembles that of the 

 Swamp sparrow, (Amm. palustris.) It is neither a very active nor a shy bird, 

 and was not rare at the localities mentioned." 



In a collection of birds deposited in this Academy by Mr. E. L. Kern, and 

 collected by him while with the expedition of Col. Fremont in 1846, there is 

 a specimen of a young bird very much resembling that now described, but much 

 larger, being about the size of the E. hypochondria D'Orb., and is, I think an 

 unknown species. The specimen is not only in bad plumage, but so much injured 

 as scarcely to admit of being mounted. 



5. Carduelis Lamrencei, nobis. 



Form. Bill rather conical, three outer primaries longest and nearly equal ; 

 tail coverts long, tail emarginate. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 4i 

 inches, wing 2 and 8-lOths, tail 2 inches. 



Colors. % . Head above and a small space around the bill and upon the throat, 

 black ; head behind and sides of the neck pale cinereous, shading into fine brown- 

 ish olive upon the back, and into a paler cinereous upon the sides under the 

 wings, nearly white upon the abdomen and inferior tail coverts. Lesser and 

 exposed portion of greater wing coverts, rump, breast and belly fine pale yellow; 

 upper tail coverts cinereous. Spurious wing, black, conspicuous. 



Quills brownish black, primaries and succeeding secondaries externally edged 

 with yellow; shorter secondaries edged and tipped with ashy white. Tail 

 brownish black, the external feathers each with a large spot of white on its inner 

 webj very conspicuous. 



Hab Sonoma and San Diego, California, discovered by Mr. John G. Bell. 



o . Without black upon the head or throat, those parts being brownish olive ; 

 the yellow color upon the inferior surface more restricted. 



Obs. This beautiful little bird resembles no other Carduelis which has come 

 under my notice. Mr. Bell's note respecting it is as follows : " This bird I first 

 observed at Sonoma. In habits it much resembled our common Goldfinch (C. 

 tristis.) The flock, out of which I shot these two, was feeding in company with 

 the small black headed species ( C psaltria,) on the seeds of plants growing near 

 the ground, and when disturbed alighted upon the nearest bushes. When flying, 

 they keep up a constant chattering or calling like our common species. I also 

 saw this bird at San Diego, feeding as above in company with the crimson fronted 

 Bullfinch, {Enjthrospiza fro7itaUs,) in the open prairie. I never saw it in the 

 mountains." 



1 have named this bird in honor of Mr. George N. Lawrence, of the city of 

 New York, a gentlemen whose acquirements, especially in American Orni- 

 thology, entitle him to a high rank amongst naturalists, and for whom I have 

 a particular respect, because, like myself, in the limited leisure allowed by the 

 vexations and discouragements of commercial life, he is devoted to the more 

 grateful pursuits of natural history. 




106 [Oct. 



6. Myiothera nudiceps, nobis. 



Form. Upper part of head bald or with a few bristle like feathers, wings 

 with the fifth quill slightly longest, tail short, legs long. General fornn much 

 like M. longipes, (Vieill.) 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 6i 

 inches, wing 3 and l-8th, tail 2} inches. 



Colors. 5 . Naked space upon the head blue. Entire plumage black. Wing 

 coverts delicately edged with white, which is also the color of the basal portion 

 of the feathers of the back, (apparent only upon raising them.) Irides white. 



Hah. Panama; discovered by Mr. John G. Bell. 



Ohs. This species may readily be distinguished from others of its genus by 

 its bald head, the naked skin of which in the living bird is, as Mr. Bell informs 

 me, " Mazarine blue." His note is as follows : " These birds kept on the ground, 

 running and scratching among the leaves, like the others of the same family 

 which I send, and somewhat like our small Thrushes, (M. mustelina and solitaria.) 

 They were constantly calling and singing a short, loud, and very curious song, 

 which varied in several of its notes at different times, and is entirely different 

 from that of any of our birds. This species appeared to me to be rather a stupid 

 bird, and was easily approached ; it has a habit of puffing up the feathers on its 

 back; the head in recently killed specimens is beautiful Mazarine blue. It was 

 represented to me as a very rare bird by several residents at Panama." 



7. Leuconerpes albolarvatus, nobis. 



Form. Robust, wings with the fourth primary longest, secondaries broad, 

 abruptly terminated, sub-emarginate ; tail rather long, with the feathers soft at 

 the ends. Legs and feet rather slender. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 9 inches, 

 wing 5, tail Zi inches. 



Colors. 5 . Wide mask including greater'part of the head and extending 

 upon the breast, white, which is also the color of a basal portion of both webs of 

 the primaries, and upon the outer webs in a few feathers extends for two thirds 

 of their length. Narrow occipital band scarlet. All other parts, including body 

 above and below, wings and tail, black. 



o . Similar, but rather smaller, and without the occipital band of scarlet. 



Hab. Near Sutter's mill, California, discovered by Mr. John G. Bell. 



Obs. Mr. Bell's note accompanying this very interesting species is as follows: 

 " I shot this bird at the Oregon canon, near Georgetown, about 12 miles from 

 Sutter's mill ; it seemed to prefer the tall pine trees, and generally kept very 

 high. In habits it appeared very much like the P. villosus. Its note is clear 

 and sharp, and it is very active and lively in its movements." Has no near 

 relative yet discovered in North America, and resembles in general characters 

 only the L. dominicanus, (Vieill.) Spix. Av. Bras. pi. 50.

J)e$criptions of three Filaria, 



By Joseph Leidy, M. D. 

 1. FiLARiA -Howij oris. Body white, opaque, linear, thread-like; mouth 

 round, simple ; posterior extrenfiity obtuse, furnished with a short, curved, epider- 

 mal booklet l-500th in. in length, by l-2000th in. in diameter at base. 



PKOCEED. ACAD. NAT. SCI. OF PHILADELPHIA. VOL. V. JNO. VI. 




118 [Nov. 



Length 5 inches 7 lines, greatest breadth l-66th in.; breadth at mouth l-230th 

 in.; at posterior extremity l-80th in. 



Remarks. The description is taken from a single specimen preserved in alco- 

 hol, in the collection of the Academy, labelled " obtained from the mouth of a 

 child." 



Is it a young individual, or perhaps a male of the Filaria medinensis, or Guinea* 

 worm I The latter, as is well known, infests the human body, often growing to 

 an enormous length, several yards or more, in the intertropicsof Asia and Africa. 

 It is frequently brought in the body of negro slaves from Africa to America^ 

 where no entozoon of the kind has ever been noticed to be parasitic in man as an 

 indigenous production. From some late observations on the course of life of 

 entozoa, helminthologists have been led to suspect that most, and probably all en- 

 tozoa pass different stages of their existence in different animals. If such be the 

 fact, may the Filaria medinensis not owe its introduction into the human body> 

 from the custom which prevails in those countries, where the worm is found, of 

 using insect food ? Insects are well known to be infested with Filarise, probably 

 more than any other class of animals. In Egypt, Arabia, &c., the locust i^ 

 eaten; in Guinea, &c., the larger coleoptera; in the raw state, and in this con- 

 dition Filari-E may often be swallowed, and reach a higher developement of thei^ 

 existence in the human body. 



2. Filaria Canis cordis. Body white, opaque, linear, nearly uniform 

 throughout, posteriorly subulate, pointed ; mouth simple, round. 



Length 10 to lOi inches, greatest breadth 2-5th of a line, anteriorly l-5th of a 

 line; half an inch from posterior end, 1-lOth of a line. 



Remarks. The description is taken from two individuals preserved in alcohol, 

 in the collection of the Academy, presented by Dr. R. Coates, who obtained 

 them, according to the label upon the bottle, from the parietes of the heart of a 

 dog. 



3. Filaria Boa constrictoris. 



9 . Body white, cylindrical ; integument translucent, longitudinally striated ; 

 mouth simple, round ; oesophagus cylindrical, opaque white ; intestine opa- 

 lescent, cylindrical, tortuous, corrugated, wider than the oesophagus ; anus 

 terminal, round ; generative aperture close to the mouth ; ovaries two, very long 

 and very tortuous. 



Remarks. The description is taken from two specimens ; one 10 inches long, 

 by 4-5ths of a line wide, the other 6i in. longby 3-5ths of a line wide. In the former 

 the cESophagus is 9 lines long and l-3d of a line wide, the intestine 13 in. long 

 and 3-5ths of a line wide. 



Habitation. Found in the areolar tissue, in an irregular or tortuous position, 

 between the muscles of the ribs and the integument of a Boa constrictor. 



Note. In the same Boa constrictor, which was dissected by my friend Dr. 

 Hallowell and myself, we found in the right lung 6 females, 4 males, and a very 

 young individual of Pentastomum proboscideum, and in the ureters of the kidnies 

 26 individuals of Distomum horridum. 



ELECTION. 



Mr. Richard P. Remington, of Philadelphia, was elected a Member 

 of the Academy.

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



A communication was read from the Minister of Public Works of 

 France, dated Paris, Sept. 5th, 1850, accompanying a number of Vols. 

 of the "Journal des Mines," and of the Annates des Mines," which 

 had been deficient in the series of that Work in the Library of the 

 Academy ; and also asking in return, certain numbers of the Journal 

 and Proceedings of this Institution. 



A letter was read from Professor Nillson of Sweden, dated Lund, 

 Sept. 30th, 1850, returning acknowledgments for his election as a Cor- 

 respondent ofthex\cademy,and staling his intention to present a copy of 

 his work on the Fauna of Scandinavian Vertebrata ; and also offering 

 to procure for the Academy, Zoological specimens of that country, if 

 desirable. Referred to the Zoological Committee. 



Dr. Leidy read a paper entitled " New genera of Vermes," which, 

 being intended for publication in the Proceedings, was referred to Drs. 

 Zantzinger, B. H. Coates and Hallowell. 



December lOt/i. 

 Vice-President Bridges, in the Chair. 



Dr. Leidy exhibited several molar teeth and fragments of maxillae 

 of a fossil Rhinoceros, from Missouri territory, received from the 

 Smithsonian Institution through Prof. Baird, which indicate a species 

 little more than half the size of the recent R. indicus. He character- 

 ized it under the name of R. occidentalis. 



Dr. Leidy also exhibited drawings, and offered the following remarks 

 on the nettling organs of the Hydra : 



There are three different forms of these organs. The first are of comparatively 

 large size, and are pyriform in shape, measuring about l-1700ths in. in length, 

 by l-2125ths in. in breadth. They are found principally upon the arms, and 

 anterior two thirds of the surface of the body, although they are found upon the 

 posterior third also, but few in number. Colorless and transparent, they contain 

 within them an elongated pyramidal body about l-3400ths in. in length, the apex 

 of which is in contact with, or slightly protrudes from, the projecting extremity 

 of the nettling cell ; the base is divided into four lobes and rests upon a prolate 

 spheroid body which has its other extremity applied to the middle of the concav- 

 ity of a cup-shaped mass of faintly yellowish matter occupying the inferior third 

 or bas-fond of the receptacle. The pyramidal body is described by Corda* as 

 being a calcareous dart capable of protrusion from the cell, but incorrectly, 

 for when it is forced from its receptacle, it divides into four spine-like 

 processes, which project outward nearly at right angles to the extruded mass. 

 The intervals unoccupied, and the bodies just described within the cell are filled 



Nov. Act. Phys. Med. 1836, p. 301. 




120 [Dec. 



with a transparant colorless fluid. When the Hydra brings its arms in contact 

 with its prey, the projecting ends of those nettling cells which touch it appear to 

 adhere to the captured animal, and in the struggles of the latter, a delicate thread 

 from the nettling cell is observed to be attached to the prey which is lengthened 

 in the movements oC the latter, entangling its limbs ; and if the struggling con- 

 tinues or the prisoner escapes, it will be found to have several of the nettling 

 cells, torn from the Hydra, adhering by the long delicate threads. In the detach- 

 ment of the nettling cells, after considerable elongation of the thread, the whole 

 of the interior mechanism is first withdrawn from the cell and adheres to its pro- 

 jecting end, as a cylindrical mass, faintly outlined, with a pyramidal summit 

 from which proceeds the thread, and from the upper third of its sides, rise out- 

 wardly like springs, nearly at right angles to it, the four spinous processes be- 

 fore mentioned. The nettling cell itself, appears darkly outlined from the thick- 

 ness of its wall, and is much narrower than in the ordinary condition from the loss 

 of a considerable part of its contents, and within is nothing else but a clear fluid. 

 The traction continuing, the whole cell and appurtenances become detached from 

 the Hydra. The thread which originated in the interior of the cell appears to be 

 of a viscid character, for if any of these cells of the arms of the Hydra come in 

 contact with its own body, they adhere with such tenacity, that the former can 

 only be detached, at the expense of the loss of several of the nettling cells. From 

 the detached cells often being found attached to the Hydra itself by the long 

 threads, some observers, as Ehrenberg,* have considered that they were organs, 

 which the animal threw out from itself like anchors. 



The second form of nettling organs, are found arranged in more or less regular 

 circles around the first or largest form, usually nine to fourteen in a circle. 

 They are transparent, pyriform, about l-3400th in. in length by 1 -5666th in. in 

 breadth, and have projecting from the prominent extremity a cilium about l-875th 

 in. in length. These cells are described by Corda as containing a thick walled 

 sac, adhering to the outer cell at the base of the cilium. According to my obser- 

 vations, the appearance of an inner sac arises from a contained thread which 

 forms a double spiral, one end of which forms the cilium projecting from the 

 nettling cell. 



The third form of nettling organs, are found in greatest abundance about the 

 head of the animal, but also exist upon the arms, particularly at the lower part, 

 and upon the surface of the body generally. This form appears never to have 

 been before noticed. They are oblonc;, transparent cells, about 1-2 125th in. long 

 by l-5666th in. broad, and contain within them a spiral thread, more delicate than 

 in the second form of cells, and have a greater number of turns which take a 

 direction transversely to the length of the cell. They resemble very much in 

 their appearance one of the forms of nettling cells of Corynactis, figured by All- 

 man in the 17th vol. of the Annals of Natural History, PI. 11, fig. 4. I have never 

 been able to see the threads prolonged externally, on account of their minuteness, 

 in contact with the prey of the Hydra ; but by pressure and the continued en- 

 dosmosis of water I have detected them protruded in this as well as the second 

 form described. 



All the forms of nettling organs are placed within especial organic cells, adher-

ing by the more prominent extremity of the organ to that part of the interior pa- 

 rietes of the cell, corresponding to the free surface of the animal upon which they 

 are placed. Their developement is special from the granular contents of the or- 

 ganic cells and not from the nucleus, for in the first or largest form of nettling 

 organs, in their developement upon a bud of the Hydra, I have been able to detect 

 one within an organic cell, and a nucleolated nucleus at its side. 



The foregoing observations have been made in frequent efforts to detect some 

 form of cell within the head of the Hydra which would be different from the gene- 

 ral structure of the body, and probably characterize a nervous system, but although 

 I have examined the animal in different menstrua under a variety of circum- 

 stances, I have never been able to discover anything which could be referred to a 

 nervous structure. 



December 17th. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



A communication was read from the American Philosophical So- 

 ciety, dated Dec. 7th, 1850, acknowledging the reception of Part 1, 

 Vol. 2, of the Journal of the Academy. 



A communication was read from Dr. T. C. Henry, dated Albany, 

 Dec. 2d, 1850, in reference to two fishes from Oswego Lake, lately 

 presented by him to the Academy, and describing one of them as a 

 new species under the name of Centrarchus Oswego. On motion, the 

 communication was referred to a committee consisting of Mr. Cassin, 

 Dr. Fisher arid Dr. Leidy. 



Dr. Leidy presented for the inspection of the members, fragments 

 of fossil mammalian remains, from Missouri Territory, received from 

 the Smithsonian Institution, through Prof. Baird, consisting of portions 

 of crania, maxilla) and teeth, which he characterized under the names 

 of Rhinoceros nebraskensis a species not much larger than a common 

 hog, Palaeotherium Bairdii, Merycoidodon Culbertsonii, and Agrio- 

 choerus antiquus. 



1. Rhinoceros Nebraskensis. A species founded upon a great portion of the 

 face, containing all the superior molar teeth ; an inferior maxilla with six 

 molars ; and three superior, apparently deciduous molars. It is about the same 

 size as the R. minutus of Cuvier. 



Length of line of seven superior molars, .... 4 7-10 inches. 



" six inferior " . . . . 4 2-10 " 



Breadth of jaws from the first superior true molar teeth of one 



side to the other, 3 8-10 " 



2. Agriochcerus, n. g. Founded upon a great portion of the face and inferior 

 maxilla, containing six molar teeth on each side, and the posterior two molars of 

 both sides superiorly of another individual. The posterior molars of this genus 

 resemble in general form those of Merycopotamus, Fall-., 4- Cant., and are about 

 one-third smaller, but the outer demicones are not separated to the base from 

 each other like the former, but are combined by a rounded column as in Hyo- 

 potamus bovinus. 




122 



[Dec. 



The fourth premolar has four demicones, but the Internal posterior one is rudi- 

 mentary. The third has two demicones; the external large, the internal small. 

 The second form, but a single cusp. The inferior true molars in general form re- 

 semble those of Merycoidodon, but may at a glance be distinguished by the pos- 

 terior edge of the postero-external demicone bifurcating before it terminates, 

 sending one arm to join the internal angle of the posterior internal demicone ; the 

 other to join its posterior external face about the centre. 



Length of range of superior six molars, 3 in. 1 line. 



" < inferior posterior five molars, . . . 3 " 1 " 



Breadth efface from one superior posterior molar to the other, 2 " 10 " 



The species he called A. antiquus. 



3. PALiEOTHEPauM. Remains of this genus have been previously discovered in 

 this country. Dr. Prout in Silliman's Journal, Vol. 3, n. s., p. 248, describes a 

 fragment of an inferior maxilla of a species larger than the P. magnum of 

 Cuvier. The species, for distinction, may be named P. Proutii. 



A second species was founded upon the cranium and a portion of the face con- 

 taining the true molars ; and the six superior and inferior molars of both sides of 

 another individual. This species is about two-thirds the size of P. crassum. The 

 arrangement of the superior molars is very like that of Paleotherium Hippoides. 

 Length of range of seven superior molars, .... 2 8-10 inches.

This second species Dr. L. named P. Bairdii, in honor of Prof. S. F. Baird, 

 Curator of the Smithsonian Institution. 



Dr. Morton commenced a series of remarks on the embalmed heads 

 of Man, and the inferior animals from the Egyptian Catacombs ; previ- 

 ously to which, he exhibited a drawing made from one of the former, 

 which delineated with truthful pre- 

 cision the peculiar characteristics 

 of the Egyptian conformation. 

 The accompanying cut has been 

 made from the drawing : -,,,,,

He called the attention of the Society 

 to the fact, that the mummied body 

 unwrapped by Mr. Gliddon, in Boston, 

 during the past year, is unequivocally 

 identified with the reign of Osorkon IH, 

 by finding the cartouche or oval of that 

 King stamped in four different places on 

 a leather cross, placed diagonally on 

 the thorax in front. 



Osorkon belongs to the XXII Dynas- 

 ty, and his reign is placed between the 

 years 890 and 905 B. C; consequently 

 the present individual, who was Theban, 

 dates back about 2730 years. The physical characteristics are admirably in ac- 




1850.] 123 



cordance with those of the pure Egyptian race, as seen in the somewhat receding 

 forehead, the gently arched nose, slightly retracted chin, and general delicacy of 

 form and proportion of the facial bones. The hair was destroyed by the bitu- 

 menizing process, which has been performed in such excess as to efface the expres- 

 sion of the soft parts, and to render it impossible to measure the facial angle, or 

 the internal capacity of the cranium. 



There are one hundred and thirty embalmed Egyptian heads in the Collection 

 of the Academy, but none of them can be even proximately dated ; whence the 

 great interest that attaches to the present example. 



Two Egyptian heads were then unwrapped in the presence of the members. 

 They were both from Thebes, where they were procured by A. C. Harris, Esq. 

 of Alexandria, sent by him to Mr. Gliddon, and placed by the latter gentleman 

 in the collection of Dr. Morton. 



One of these heads, was of a man of 80 years, of Pelasgic or Graeco-Egyptian 

 form, with remarkably fine proportions and expression, and very fine hair, which 

 the embalming process had changed, as it always does, from a black to a dark 

 brown color. 



The second head was that of a female, which was unfortunately so broken 

 as to leave nothing but the cranial poition, and a profusion of the long, fine, 

 curling hair, which was one of the characteristics of the azUoctho7ies of the 

 Nile. 



December 24'th. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



A letter was read from Dr. John Evans, dated St. Louis, Mo., Dec. 

 9th, 1850, acknowledging the receipt of his notice of election, as a Cor- 

 respondent. 



Also one from the New York State Library, dated Albany, Dec. 

 20th, 1850, acknowledging the reception of Part 1, Vol. 2, New Series, 

 of the Journal. 



Also one of the same import from the Smithsonian Institution, dated 

 Washington, Dec. 3d, 1850. 



Mr. Cassin read a paper intended for publication in the Proceed- 

 ings, entitled "Notice of an American species of Duck, hitherto regard- 

 ed as identical with the Oidemia fusca, Linn." Referred to Drs. Zant- 

 zinger, Townsend, and Woodhouse. 



Dr. Morton made some additional remarks on embalmed Egyptian 

 heads.

Description of new genera of Vermes. 

 By Joseph Letdy, M. D. 



1. Peloscolex. n.g. Setae in two rows, 6 to 10 in each fasciculus; podal 

 hooks in two rows, in twos or threes, bifurcated at the free extremity; each an- 

 nulation furnished with a circle of prominent tubercles, with numerous smaller 

 ones. Upper lip hardly projecting. Girdle not prominent. Blood red. 



1. Peloscolex Variegatus. Body cylindrical, posteriorly obtuse, anteriorly 

 sub-acute. Setcc simple, usually 10 in each fasciculus anterior to the girdle, 

 absent in the posterior 22 annulations. Podal hooks anteriorly in threes, diver- 

 gent, strong, sigmoid, bifurcated at the extremity ; posteriorly in twos, one rudi- 

 mentary. Each annulation furnished with a circlet of elevated, rounded tubercles, 

 1. sooth in. in heighth, and numerous smaller ones, also arranged in transverse 

 circles. Anterior, 3 or 4 annulations reddish ; after these 25 are deep black, 

 except the tenth or girdle, which is broad and brownish ; posterior annulations 

 red or brown. Upper lip so little projecting that the mouth appears almost termi- 

 nal, furnished with short, stiff hairs. Whole number of annulations 50. 



Length 4 lines ; length of setae, l-133d in. to l-80th in. ; length of podal hooks 

 l-400th in. to l-178th in. 



Habitation. Foand in the spring of the year in the ferruginous mud at the 

 bottom of springs impregnated with iron, near Philadelphia. 



2. Chaetogaster, Baer:

 Nais dia'phina and Nais diastropha, Gruithuisen. Nov. act. nat. cur. 182S, 



p. 407. 



Body cylindrical, elongate ; mouth inferior, large, triangular; anus terminal. 

 Podal spines in transverse fasciculi, inferior, simple ; the first pair of fasciculi 

 close to the mouth ; the second distant. Intestine straight, capacious. Eyes 

 none. Blood white. Increasing by division. Leidy. 



2. Chaetogaster GULOsus. Body whitish, translucent; posteriorly obtuse, cili- 

 ated with long hairs; mouth infero-terminal, large, triangular, simple; upper lipdi- 

 gitiform, ciliated. (Esophagus short, narrow ; first stomach long, cylindrical, 

 transparent ; 2nd stomach large, oblong ; intestine straight, capacious. Podal 

 spines in pairs of fasciculi of 5 or 6 each, simple, divergent, curved backward 

 near the free end, retractile ; first pair just posterior to each side of the mouth 

 inferiorly ; second pair removed far back. Usually found in the state of di- 

 vision ; commonly 2 to 4 subdivisions. 



First subdivision l-24th in. ; furnished with 6 pairs of fasciculi of podal spines, 

 the second pair one half of the length of the subdivision from the first or oral 

 pair. Second subdivision 1-lOOth in. ; third, l-66th in. ; fourth 1-lOOth in. 

 Each of these latter furnished with 4 fasciculi of podal spines. 



Whole length, 1 line ; will contract to half a line ; breadth, l-140th in. ; 

 mouth, when open, l-250th in. ; length of podal spines, l-133d in. 



Habitation and Remarks. Foundi abundantly with Hydra fusca, etc., in the 

 water of marshes in the vicinity of Philadelphia. This worm is very active in 

 its movements and very rapacious. Creeping upon bodies in the water, it 

 rapidly elongates the anterior part of its body in various directions, and swallows 

 great numbers of the smaller infusoria. In turn, it is much preyed upon by the 




1850.) 125 



Hydra fusca. When the anterior part of the body is elongated in search of food, 

 the mouth is much distended and terminal. 



3. Rhynchoscolex, n. g. Body cylindical, soft, naked, transversely and finely 

 striated, vibrillated,anteriorly elongated into a proboscidiform appendage. Mouth 

 inferior; anus terminal. Intestine simple, straight. Eyes none. 



3. Rhynchoscolex simplex. Yellowish white, opaque, anteriorly abruptly at- 

 tenuated into a long, cylindrical clavate, proboscidiform appendage : anteriorly 

 abruptly narrowed, obtusely truncate or rounded. Proboscis presenting longitu- 

 dinal and numerous transverse marks. Mouth inferior, at the base of the 

 latter appendage. Intestine straight and capacious. 



Length, 2 to 3 lines ; breadth, l-6th of a line; proboscis l-133d in. long, but 

 may lengthen to l-80th in. 



Habitation and Remarks. A small wriggling worm found among yellowish 

 fragments of vegetable matters and conferva; at the bottom of clear brooks in 

 the vicinity of Philadelphia. Under a very little pressure it undergoes rapid 

 disintegration into globular masses : (cells of the structure distended by endos- 

 mosis ?) 



1. Emea.* Body elongated, plano-convex, soft, proteiform, naked, covered 

 with minute vibrillae. Alimentary canal simple, tortuous, furnished with a giz- 

 zard containing a dental apparatus; mouth and anus terminal. Eyes two or three, 

 on each side of the head. 



1. Emea rubra. Elongated, compressed, contracting irregularly, broadest pos- 

 teriorly, anteriorly obtuse, yellowish flesh colored. Head semi-oval, neck project- 

 ing laterally. Eyes, two or three black spots placed in a line behind one another 

 on each side of the head and neck. Mouth simple, opening into a narrow 

 pharynx; intestine cylindrical, narrowed posteriorly, furnished with a small, 

 round, muscular stomach, containing a corneous dental apparatus at its entrance. 

 Generative apparatus consisting of two very tortuous and capacious tubes, pass- 

 ing the whole length of the body on each side of the alimentary canal. 



Length from 3 to 10 lines; breadth l-5th to l-3d of aline. 



Habitation and Remarks. Found in marshes in the vicinity of Philadelphia, 

 creeping upon dead vegetable substances, or upon the ground. When touched or 

 irritated, it secretes a large quantity of very tenacious mucous. Under slight pres- 

 sure it will voluntarily evert more than one half of the intestinal canal through 

 the mouth, and upon removal of the pressure, after some minutes, will again with- 

 draw it, and apparently without injury having been sustained, as the animal 

 lives for days afterwards in its usual circumstances. The interior of the body, 

 in the intervals of the viscera, is filled with discoidal corpuscles, as in Nais, etc. 

 The interior of the intestine is every where furnished with nutritive villoid ap- 

 pendages. 



2. AwoRTHA.f Body sub-compressed, soft, naked, vibrillated, inarticulate. Ali- 

 mentary canal simple, straight, alternately contracted and dilated. Mouth and 

 anus terminal, simple, indistinct. Eyes none. 



2. Anoktha gracilis. White, opalescent, very contractile, moniliform

from an alternation of contraction and dilatation, corresponding usually to ten 

 segments, into which the animal may subdivide, but more or less disappearing in 

 elongation of the body, becoming more apparent by wrinkling in shortening of 

 the body ; anteriorly semi-ovate, sub-acute ; posteriorly elongated, cylindroid, 

 obtusely rounded. Apparent segments panduriform, furnished each posteriorly 

 with a clear globular nucleolated nucleus. Intestine variable in capacity, usu- 

 ally dilated in the anterior dilatation of each apparent segment, and much con- 

 tracted in the intervals. 



Length from 1-2 to 2 lines, shortening to 1 or 1-4 aline ; breadth, when elonga- 

 ted, from l-400th to 1 300th in. ; when shortened from l-300th in. to 1-2 of a 

 line. 



Habitatio7i and Remarks. Found in the same situation as the preceding, 

 creeping planaria-like upon different substances, or most frequently holding 

 a vertical position in the water, apparently without movement, but re- 

 taining their position by means of the actively moving vibrillae, whicii are com- 

 paratively larger than in the preceding worms. They appear to feed upon vegetable 

 particles brought to the mouth by means of the currents produced by vibrillae. The 

 intestine is usually empty, except at the dilated portions, where it is yellowish or 

 greenish, from granular matters contained within. The whole structure of the 

 animal is exceedingly simple, composed of nucleolated, granular corpuscles, those 

 forming the exterior of the body being furnished with vibrillee. Under slight 

 pressure, these corpuscles undergo separation from one another, and become 

 globular by endosmosis; in this state they measure from the l-7000th in. to the 

 l-2800th in. The nucleoli are globular, shining, and measure the l-90Qthin. in 

 diameter. The exterior vibrillated corpuscles, after separation from the body, 

 often move about for some seconds. The vibrillee measure about l-3500th in. 

 long. Each segment of the animal's body, at its posterior part, contains a globu- 

 lar, transparent nucleus, measuring the l-2333d in. in diameter, with a globular, 

 refractile nucleolus the l-7000th in. in diameter. This latter body, with the form 

 of the apparent segments, makes the animal resemble a row of gregarinae attached 

 together. 



The Committee on the following paper by Mr. Cassin, read Dec. 

 24th, 1850, reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings. 



Notice of an American species of Duck, hitherto regarded as identical with the 



Oidtmia fiisca, {Linn.) 

 By John Cassin. 



Oidemia velvetina, nobis. Audubon, Birds of Am. pi. 247. 



Form. 5 Generally similar to that of 0. fusca, but is rather larger, bill 

 longer and more slender, with the protuberance at the base of the upper mandible 

 more prominent and more extended. Space between the nostril and the edge of 

 the upper mandible much narrower in the present species. 



Upon the protuberance at the base of the bill in this species, the velvet like 

 plumage of the front terminates in a well defined point, as represented in the 

 figure of the female in Aud. pi. 247, while in 0. fusca this termination is abruptly 

 sub-rounded as in both figures in Selby, Ill.pl. 67, though I have never seen a 

 specimen in which this rounded character is so distinctly marked as there 

 represented.

Color. 5 Entitely black, except a spot under the eye and the exposed por- 

 tion of the secondaries, which are white. The white spot under the eye is larger 

 in the species now described. 



Hab. Atlantic coast of North America. 



Obs. The two species here alluded to are easily distinguished from each other 

 when examined toi^ether, and both may possibly be found in America and Europe. 

 The pointed extension of the velvety plumage upon the upper mandible is the 

 most ready character by which the species now described may be known. It ap- 

 pears to be the bird figured by both Wilson and Audubon as the Anas fusca 

 Linn. 



Specimens of both species are in the collection of this Society; the specimen 

 which led to their examination was shot at Egg Harbor. N. J., and presented re- 

 cently by our fellow member, E. J. Lewis, M. D. 



The annual Report of the Treasurer was read and referred to the 

 Auditors. 



The Report of the Librarian was read, as follows : 



REPORT 



OFTHELIBRARIAN 



For the year 18.00. 



The additions to the Library, of all descriptions, during the present year amount 



to 2965, this number being more than double that of 1849, and far exceeding the 



ratio of any previous year since 1834. The subjoined table has been prepared in 



the ordinary form, presenting the number of volumes, pamphlets, and works in 



parts or numbers, in each subject. 



Of the whole number 2965, there have been contributed by authors 74; by edi- 

 tors 18 ; by members, correspondents, and others 109 ; by societies and corpora- 

 tions 113 ; by Dr. Wilson 2493; by Mr. Edward Wilson, of Wales, 153; by the 

 TJ. S. Treasury Department 5 (charts.) 



The extensive contributions of Dr. Wilson to the Library, including those of the 

 present and previous years, are now the property of the Society, on the sole condi- 

 tion that they are not to be loaned from the Hall. The propriety of this restric- 

 tion is unhesitatingly acknowledged by all connected with the institution. It is 




128 [Dec- 



also in entire accordance with the views of the earlier members of the Society, 

 among them ?.^r. Maclure, who was decidedly in favor "of making the Library a 

 Reading Room, with all possilde facilities for those persons who wish to consult 

 the books." I quote from the excellent report of the Library committee pre- 

 sented in 1836. These facilities are now certainly all that can be desired, and we 

 may even hope that the restriction will be extended by an act of the So- 

 ciety, to all the hooks contained in the Library, no exceptions being made as at 

 present. 



Among the many valuable additions this year, may be mentioned the follow- 

 ing: D'Orbigny's Palaeontologie Frangaise, nearly complete, from Dr. Morton; 

 Blainville's Osteographie as far as published; Demidoff's Voyage dans la Russie 

 Meridionale; Paxton's Magazine of Botany, Vols. 1 to 17; Memoirs of the Royal 

 Society of Lille, 26 vols.; Commentationes Soc. Reg. Sci. Gottingensis, 32 vols.; 

 Comptes Rendus, vols. 1 to 23, (completing the series in the Library ;) Aiinales 

 des Sciences Nat., 3d series, 20 vols.; Miscellanea curiosa, Ephemerides, Acta 

 Physico-medica,and Nova Acta Acad. Casar, Leopold-Carol mre Nat.Curiosorum, 

 about 80 vols.; Commercium Litterarium, 15 vols.; Transactions of several Berlin 

 Societies, 39 vols.; Annales Acad. Rheno-Trajectinae, 25 vols.; Memoires, An- 

 nales, Nouv. Annales, et Archives du Museum d"Hist. Nat. de Paris, 21 vols, 

 (completing the Academy's series ;) Commentarii de R 'bus, 44 vols.; Diction- 

 naire des Sci. Nat. 75 vols.; Trans, of Royal Irish Academy, vols. 1 to 13; of the 

 Royal Asiatic Society, vols. 1 to 10 ; Journal of the Ro)-al Geographical Society, 

 vols. 1 to 19; Brewster's Edinburgh Journal of Science, and Brande'sdo. 32 vols.; 

 Diet, classique d'Hist. nat. 17 vols.; Shaw's General Zoology, 14 vols.; for all of 

 which we are indebted to the untiring liberality of Dr. Wilson. 



Mr. Edward Wilson, of Pembrokeshire, Wales, the brother of our esteemed 

 fellow-member, has been a large contributor to the Library during the pre- 

 sent year. He has also been instrumental in creating an interest in the Library with 

 other friends of our institution abroad, and among them a number of naturalists and 

 men of science, from whom we have already derived numerous highly acceptable 

 contributions. 



Through exchanges with Societies, we continue to receive considerable acces- 

 sions to the Journal department. To the " Ecole des Mines," of Paris, we are 

 particularly indebted this year, for eighteen volumes of the Journal and Annales des 

 Mines. Our series of that valuable periodical is now complete, with the excep- 

 tion of three or four volumes. The exchange list, however, is not yet as desira- 

 ble as we hope it will be, when our relations with foreign scientific bodies are 

 more extended, and placed upon a better and more permanent footing than at 

 present. 



The extraordinary rapidity with which the Library of our favored institution 

 has advanced of late years, has astonished and gratified all connected with 

 it. In the last annual report it was stated that, in consequence of its great 

 increase, it had become necessary to extend the accommodations for books into 

 the adjoining room, and that arrangements were then being made for that pur- 

 pose. The alterations were soon afterwards completed, and the apartment has 

 been fitted up in a tasteful and commodious manner. The cases on ihe floor con- 

 tain the various Transactions, Journals, and similar works, and those on the gal- 

 lery are entirely occupied with the Dictionaries of Arts and Sciences, and the 

 valuable collection of works on Antiquities and the Fine Arts. 




1850.] 



129 



The Library has increased from about 7000 volumes in 1836, to upwards of 

 12,000 volumes in 1850, a period of about fourteen years, nearly all of which have 

 been the gratuitous contributions of individuals or societies, very few having been 

 obtained by purchase, or through public sources. The annexed statement shows 

 the number of volumes in each department, ascertained by actual enumeration 

 within the last few days.

The following report was read by Dr. Leidy, Chairman of the 

 Curators : 



REPORT 



OF THE CURATORS 



For 1850. 



The museum of the Academy has continued to increase during the year just 

 closing, with the vigor which characterized it the preceding two years. Several 

 of the departments have received very large accessions; others, which from their 

 comparative state of completeness preclude any extensive contributions, have re- 

 ceived donations of value and rarity ; and all have had important additions. 



The arrangement of the Cabinet of the Academy devolves upon a few members, 

 who being able to devote but a portion of their time to the purpose, from the extent 

 of the collection it must be necessarily slow. One of our most important aids in 

 this respect we lost last summer : I allude to our much lamented fellow-member 

 and Vice President, Dr. R. E. Griffith, who was steadily engaged, during his mo- 

 ments of leisure, in arranging the conchological collection, to which he had so ex- 

 tensively and liberally contributed. 



The Academy has also been unfortunate this year in the loss of another of its 

 important members. Dr. Gambel, one of our best and most enterprising ornithol- 

 ogists, who, when at home, frequently lent his valuable assistance in arranging 

 the ornithological collection. 




130 [Dec. 



AH objects of the museum of a destructible character are in a good state 

 of preservation, and appear to be well protected from the attacks of Der- 

 mestes and Ptinus by the vapor of ether, which has been lately introduced 

 into use for this purpose by Dr. Wilson. 



The increase in the cabinet during this year, will be briefly noticed under the 

 head of each respective department. 



Mammalia. In this class the Academy has been greatly enriched by the addi- 

 tion of the collection of Dr. J. K. Townsend, made by himself in the Rocky 

 Mountains and Oregon, consisting of 37 species, 56 specimens, in skin, in a good 

 state of preservation. These were liberally presented to the Society by Dr. 

 Townsend. Most of them are the specimens from which the species were origip- 

 ally described, and many of them are exceedingly rare in natural history collec- 

 tions, and a few are unique.* Among them are two specimens of the gigantic 

 wolf of America, Lu'pus gigas, lately described by Dr. Townsend in the Journal 

 of the Academy. 



We have also received skins of twenty species of mammalia, f of Euiope, Asia, 

 Africa, and Australia, from W. E. Strickland, Esq., of England, through Dr. 

 Wilson. 



Another addition of great value was made by Dr. T. B. Wilson, consisting of 

 one hundred specimens from the collection of the Prince of Canino, C. L. Bona- 

 parte, being the originals of those species figured and described in the Fauna 

 Italica. 



We are also indebted to Capt. W. McMichael for 7 species. 8 specimens, of 

 animals from Van Dieman's Land. 



Besides the above there were presented to the Society ten species from various 

 sources. 



Aves. We have received during the year 71 bird skins, of which 51 are from 

 Van Dieman's Land, presented by Capt. W. McMichael; 10 from China, present- 

 ed by Capt. John Land ; the remainder from various localities, presented by Dr. 

 E. J. Lewis, and others. 



The valuable Des Murs collection of Bird's eggs, containing 12S1 species, men- 

 tioned in the last report of the Curators as a deposit, has since been presented to 

 the Academy by Dr. Wilson. 



To Mr. Samuel Ashmead we are also indebted for the donation of 38 species, 

 48 specimens of American bird's eggs. 



There were also presented by various individuals, principally members of the 

 Society, 15 species of nests, and 23 of eggs, from different localities. 



Reptilia. Of reptiles there have been received 65 species, 80 specimens, be- 

 sides numerous American duplicates, principally from Dr. McCartee, of Ningpo, 

 China ; Capt. John Land ; Mr. Sandwith Drinker, of Hong Kong, China ; and Mr. 

 Ashmead. 



Pisces. In ichthyology the cabinet has received, rather unexpectedly, a large 

 and very valuable collection, presented by Dr. T.B. Wilson, consisting of 767 

 bottles containing fishes in alcohol, and 177 dried specimens of the latter, for-

January *ith^ 1851. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



A letter was read from the Minister of Public Works of France, 

 dated Paris, Sept. 4, 1851, accompanying; No. 3, 4th series, of the 

 Annales des Mines. 



Also a letter from Mr. George R. Giiddon, dated Philadelphia, Jan. 

 3, 1851, requesting the loan, for a short time, of the Egyptian Mummy 

 deposited in the Museum of the Academy by Mr. J. L. Hodge. Re- 

 ferred to the Curators. 



Dr. Woodhouse read a communication intended for publication, 

 entitled ''Description of the N. American Jackall, Canis frustror.^' 

 Referred to a Committee consisting of Dr. J. C. Fisher, Dr. Townsend, 

 and Dr. Leidy. 



Dr. Leidy read a communication from Mr. Richard C. Taylor, in- 

 tended for publication in the Journal, entitled " Substance of Notes 

 made during a Geological reconnoisance in the Auriferous Porphyry 

 region next the Caribbean Sea, in the Province of Veraguas and Isth- 

 mus of Panama ;" which was referred to the following Committee, 

 viz : Dr. Elwyn, Dr. Morton, and Mr. Ashmead. 



The Secretary read an extract from a letter addressed to Dr. Morton 

 by Dr. John Evans, dated St. Louis, Dec. 19, 1850, in relation to an 

 intended Expedition to Missouri and Oregon. 



The Chairman called attention to the enormous development in the 

 size of the specimen of the common domestic cat presented by him 

 this evening, as the result of emasculation. The following are the 

 dimensions, weight, &c. : 



Length from tip to tip 3 feet; circumference at middle 19^ inches; 

 weight 42 pounds; color black mixed with white. 



The following Resolution, offered by Dr. Fisher, was adopted : 

 Resolved, That the President, Vice President, Secretaries and Librarian, 

 be a Committee to address the Commissioner of the Land Office at 

 Washington, and solicit an appropriation sufficient to carry out the 

 views of Dr. John Evans of Miseouri, as expressed in his letter read 

 this evening:. 



o" 



January 14<t/i. 

 Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



Dr. Morton referred to some communications which he had recently 

 made to the Society, on the races of Dogs, showing their origin from 

 various species of dogs and wolves. He had endeavored to obtain in- 

 formation from persons whose frontier position as officers of the army, 

 &c., afforded them suitable opportunities for this purpose, and read 

 a letter from the Hon. H. H. Sibley, M. C, from Minesota of which 

 the following is the substance. 



The Indian Dog differs much in size and appearance among differ- 



I'ROCEED. ACAD. NAT. SCI. OK PIIlLADELrillA. VOL. V. NO. VII. 19 




110 [Jan. 



ent tribes. Among the Sioux, it is large and grey, resembling the 

 Buffalo Wolf. He supposes that the Indian dog is crossed with that 

 Wolf All Indian dogs have small, sharp, erect ears. They cross 

 M'ith our domestic dogs. He does not believe that the dog crosses 

 with the small Wolf (C. frustror?) or the Fox. The Indian dog is 

 most analogous to the grey wolf, and breeds freely with the European 

 dog. 



Dr. Morton also read extracts from a letter from Dr. Cooper, of the 

 U. S. Army, dated Fort Duncan, Texas, Dec. 4, 1^50. " The Giant 

 Wolf or Lobo, [Lupus gigas] is found in this region. Its color is dark 

 grey, nearly black. It is very fearless of man. 1 have seen several 

 in the interior of Mexico. It is always solitary in its habits. The 

 small wolf or Coyote, [C. frustror] is found in great numbers here. 

 It is never more than eighteen inches or two feet long, nor more than 

 fifteen inches high." 



It resembles somewhat a grey fox-hound, and is always in packs of 

 from ten to two or three hundred. It is the most greo-arious animal 

 of the dog kind on this continent. Its voice is not like that of the 

 wolf. It feeds on the carcases of dead animals, and is very meagre. 

 It became necessary to destroy one in camp to prevent its crossing 

 with the dogs. Every rancho has a dog resembling the Coyote, and 

 a bitch to which no dog had had access, produced whelps, evidently a 

 cross with the Coyote. 



In further remarks on this subject, Dr. Morton adverted to the fact 

 that where a race is the result of a cross between two different species 

 of animals, the characteristics of one or the other race will occasionally 

 be exhibited with peculiar force in generations more or less remote 

 from the origin. 



Dr. Leidy called the attention of the Society to three fossil bones 

 from Big Bone Lick, Kentucky, belonging to the collection of organic 

 remains of the American Philosophical Society, arid now deposited 

 with the Academy, which he stated were the vertebra dentata, left os 

 calcis, and iha first phalanx of the left hind foot of the Equus Ameri- 

 canus, described by him in the Proceedings several years since. These 

 bones are about the size of the corresj)onding bones of the largest sized 

 English dray horse. 



Dr. Elwyn asked permission, which was granted, to introduce a let- 

 ter which he had received from Prof Sheppard, of Charleston, S. C, 

 requesting Dr. Elwyn to procure for him a portion of the Meteorolite, 

 found in New Jersey some years since, and presented to the Academy 

 by Dr. McEuen. Prof Sheppard was desirous of making an analysis 

 of this specimen and a comparison with other meteorolites in his posses- 

 sion, and offered in return a fragment from one of the latter specimens. 



On motion the subject was referred to the Curators, with instruc- 

 tions to comply with the request of Prof. Sheppard. 




1851.] lU 



January 2\st. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



The Corresponding Secretary read a letter from J. G. H. Kinberg, 

 dated Malmo and Gronby, 16th December, 1850, announcing that he 

 had forwarded additional objects of Natural History for the Academy, 

 and desiring certain exchanges. 



A communication was read from Joseph P. Hazard, Esq., dated Sea- 

 side, near Point Judith, Rhode Island, noticing the arrival of the Rocky 

 Mountain Swallow in that neighborhood, with some observations on 

 its habits. 



"They first made their appearance here in the Spring of 1844, when fourteen 

 pairs of them built on the east and west sides of an outhouse of my residence, 

 and such strangers were they, that I was unable to learn the name of the species 

 for some time. They have since confined themselves almost exclusively to the 

 same premises, two or three pair only having in a few cases selected other local- 

 ities in the neighborhood. 



"In the autumn of the same year, (1844) I built a barn about half a mile dis- 

 tant, on the north side of which I provided for my new friends, in case they 

 should visit me again, a convenient projection of nearly fifty feet in length, suit- 

 ably protected. In the Spring ensuing, (1845) forty nests were built on the crib 

 which was their first choice above alluded to, and as if for experiment, six nests 

 only were built on the new barn, but in the Spring of 1846, sixty five nests 

 were built on the barn, and .the crib entirely deserted. In 1847, one hundred and 

 thirty pairs built upon the barn and almost completely occupied the space pre- 

 pared for them. At this time a few pairs which were crowded out took up quar- 

 ters in the martin and blue-bird holes on the south side of the same building, 

 ousting the rightful tenants which had previously arrived and taken posses- 

 sion. 



As the location at the barn is much more protected than that on the crib, the 

 nests are there constructed with much less reference to the probability of injury 

 from the weather than formerly upon the latter, a circumstance which evinces a 

 degree of elasticity, I believe not generally accorded to instinct. 



These swallows make their first appearance here from the 10th to the 15th ot 

 May, and commence clearing out the old nests (in which many of the dead of the 

 brood of the previous year are left) about the 1st of .Tune. The material ol 

 which the nests are made, is a very fine sand with a small admixture of blue 

 clay; when dry it is very friable and the nests suffer considerable dilapidation 

 during winter. They generally make their appearance in a mass, but this season 

 four birds only came on the 5th of May, which number received almost daily ac- 

 cessions until the 28th of the sUme month. Their arrival is earlier, and their 

 departure also, than that of the barn swallow, none remaining, I believe, latei 

 than about the 1st of September. 



" One circumstance in the habits of these birds, has struck me as peculiar: 

 they are either all of them in the vicinity of their nests or all absent, not one to 

 be seen on the premises, and although my observations have not been sufficient- 




142 [Jan. 



ly particular to enable me to speak with certainty on this point, I am inclined 

 to believe these intervals of absence are at regular hours of the day. I have 

 seen them two miles distant, in pursuit of insects, which their now large num- 

 bers have probably rendered scarce in this more immediate vicinity." 



Dr. B. H. Coates read a notice of the antiquity of the use of Tin, 

 mentioning its importation from Britain by the Phoenicians, and infer- 

 ring from passages cited from Homer that it was regarded at a very early 

 period as a precious metal. The communication was referred to Mr. 

 Thomas Fisher, Mr. Phillips, and Dr. Elwyn. 



Dr. Leidy read a paper intended for publication in the Proceedings, 

 describing some new entozoa. Referred to Dr. Hallowell, Dr. Morton, 

 and Mr. H. C. Lea. 



January 28th. 

 Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



The Committee on Mr. Richard C. Taylor's paper, read Jan. 7th, 

 reported in favor of Publication in the Journal. 



The Recording Secretary read the following Report for the year 

 1850. 



REPORT 



OF THE RECORDING SECRETARY 



For 1850. 



It is customary for the Recording Secretary to submit his report at the last 

 meeting of the year, but unavoidable absence from home rendered it impossible 

 for me to offer it before this time. 



Nine members and eight correspondents have been elected, and four members 

 have died, to wit : the venerable and esteemed Alexander Maclure ; Dr. William 

 Gambel, who was not less remarkable for the goodness of his heart than for the 

 cultivation of his mind; our lamented Vice President, Dr. Robert Eglesfeld 

 Griffith, whose amiability and generosity not less than his great acquirements, 

 have rendered his loss severe; and the first elected President of the Institution, 

 Dr. Gerard Troost, who has passed away after a long life devoted to the pursuit 

 of science. 



By comparing the list of the Society published October 1, 1848, with subse- 

 quent changes, there appear to have been elected up to this time 250 members 

 and 51j correspondents, amounting in all to 793. 



It does not appear that the institution was ever so prosperous. The average 

 attendance at the meetings has been large, and many objects have been zealously 

 pursued. Many communications of great interest have been made, as the publi- 

 cation of the Proceedings and the Journal will establish. 




1S51.] 143 



I trust that I may be pardoned for suggesting that tlie prosperity of the 

 Academy might be still farther extended, if the system of introducing strangers 

 to the ordinary meetings were more general. A taste for the pursuit of science 

 mii^ht thus be cultivated, and the Society enlarged by some very excellent addi- 

 tions. 



During the year the By-Law^s have been amended as follows : Chapt. 6, Art. 1. 

 There shall be sixteen standing committees, (instead of fifteen, as before the 

 amendment) : so that the committee on mineralogy and geology be divided. 



Besides several minor communications, the following have been made during 

 the year. Four by Mr. John Cassin, entitled. Descriptions of new species of 

 birds, specimens of which are in the collection of the Acad. Nat. Sci. of Philadel- 

 phia, (6 species) published in Proceedings ; Descriptions of new species of birds 

 of the genera Paradisea, Pastor, and Buceros, and a proposition to rename others 

 of the genera Alcyone and Hirimdo, (5 species described) published in Proceed- 

 ings; Descriptions of new species of Birds collected by Mr. John G. Bell in Cali- 

 fornia, (7 species described) published in Proceedings ; Notice of an American 

 species of Duck hitherto regarded as identical with the Oidemia fusca, (Linn.) 

 published in Proceedings. One by Mr. T. A. Conrad, entitled, Descriptions of 

 new species of Fresh water Shells, (10 species) published in Proceedings. One 

 by Mr. James Deane, On the Fossil foot prints of Connecticut River, which was 

 published in the Journal. One by Dr. Lewis R. Gibbes, Catalogue of the Crus- 

 tacea in the Cabinet of A. N. S., with notes on the most remarkable, together 

 with Additions and Observations by the Committee to whom the foregoing was 

 referred, published in the Proceedings. One by S. S. Haldeman, Report on the pro- 

 gress of Entomology in the U. S. One by Mr. A. C. Harris, On the existence 

 of the Ibis religiosa on the Nile. One by Dr. T. C. Henry, of Albany, on two fishes 

 from Oswego Lake. Twelve by Dr. Joseph Leidy, as follows : Observations 

 and remarks on Entophyta in living animals and on the theory of generation ; 

 Observations accompanying numerous elaborate drawings of new entophyta in 

 animals ; Remarks on the existence of crystals within animal organic cells ; on 

 eight new American species of Annelida abranchia, (Journal) ; on new species of 

 Entophyta growing within animals, 3 species; describing two new species of 

 Infusorial Entozoa ; descriptions of some nematoid Entozoa infesting insects ; ob- 

 servations on two new genera of Mammalian fossils, Eucrotaphus Jacksoni, and 

 Archaeotherium Mortoni ; descriptions of three Filariae; on the nettling organs of 

 Hydra; descriptions of new genera of Vermes (6) ; on some bones of Rhinoceros 

 nebraskensis, &c., received from the Smithsonian Institute. Three by Dr. Mor- 

 ton, one very full communication (of which parts were made at various times) in 

 continuation of his paper on the size of the brain in the various races of man; on 

 the value of the word species in Zoology; on the antiquity of some races of dogs. 

 One by Theodore F. Moss, description of a new Carpolite from Arkansas. One 

 by Prof. David Dale Owen, and J. G. Norwood, and John Evans, notice of fossil 

 remains brought by Mr. Evans from the Mauvaises Terres or Bad Lands of 

 White River, 150 miles west of the Missouri, published in Journal. One by 

 Prof. David Dale Owen, and B. F. Shumard, M. D., description of ten new species 

 of Crinoidea from the subcarboniferous limestone of Iowa, Wisconsin, and Mine- 

 sota, 1848 9, (Journal). One by Mr. R. C. Taylor, Meteorological table and 

 notes on the climate on the east coast of the Isthmus of Panama, Port Royal in 

 Jamaica, and on the voyage to New York. One by Dr. J. K. Townsend, de- 




U-t [Feb. 



scribinj; a new species of American woll', Lupus gigas, Townsend, of North 

 America, published in Journal. 



It may not be improper while f numerating the communications, to direct atten- 

 tion to a letter from Dr. JopI Y. Shelly, accompanying fossil remains of a 

 supposed saurian found in Upper Milford, Lehigh county, Pennsylvania. Although 

 not personally acquainted with this locality, it is believed to belong to a forma- 

 tion anterior to the coal, and it may he coeval with the period of the fossil foot- 

 prints in red sandstone described by Dr. A. T. King in Proceedings for December 

 1844, and December, 1845. If this supposition be correct these are probably 

 very old and interesting remains of vertebrate animals and are therefore deserving 

 of attention. 



It seems improper to close a notice of the records, without briefly adverting to 

 the very large portion of them occupied by mere lists of the munificent donations 

 received throughout the year. The constant liberality with which so many of 

 the wants of the Academy are supplied, must be a rich source of gratitude in the 

 hearts of all its friends, and while an exquisite and high toned delicacy on the part 

 of a distinguished benefactor forbids me to breathe his name, his generous gifts 

 are appreciated among our richest treasures. All which is respectfully submitted 

 by

February i^th. 



Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



A letter was read from Prof. C. U. Sheppard, dated Charleston, 

 S. C, January 20, 1851, presenting his thanks for the fragment ot the 




IS->1.J 145 



New Jersey JNIeteorolite, and enclosinj^ in return a portion of the 

 Cabarras Meteorolite ; and also stating his intention to make further 

 donations of other meteorolites at an early period. From an examina- 

 tion of the specimen sent him, he had thus far obtained the following 

 results. Sp. gr. 3.25: it also abounds with nickeliferous iron, together 

 with magnetic iron pyrites, while the greyish-white earthy matter ap- 

 pears to be Hovvardite. (Fe Si + Mg Si.) 



A letter was read from the Scandinavian Scientific Association 

 (without date,) accompanying the donation of a copy of its Proceed- 

 ings during th>i last meeting at Copenhagen. 



A letter was read from H. B. Dewey, Fsq, dated Para, Brazil, Dec. 

 28, 1850, tendering hi^s thanks for his election as a Corresponding 

 member of the Academy, and expressing his desire to still further 

 promote the objects of the Institution. 



A communication addressed by Peter A. Browne, Fsq , to Dr. Mor- 

 ton was read, briefly enumerating the discoveries he had made by 

 means of the microscope, micrometer, and trichometer,* in regard to 

 pile, by which term he meant to include both hair and wool, as fol- 

 lows : 



1st. I have found the hair of the head of man of three principal shapes, viz. : 

 1. The cylindrical ; 2. The oval ; and 3. The eccentrically elliptical. 



Of the 1st 1 have noticed the ancient hairs from Peru, Mexico, Brazil, &c., 

 those of our present Indians and the Chinese. Of the second, the hairs of the 

 English, French, Hungarians, Germans and Americans, &c.. &c. And of the 

 third the wool of the Bushman and African negro. 



2d. The pile of the 1st and 2d class comes out of the epidermis at an acute 

 angle, that of the third at a right angle. 



3rd. The pile of the 1st class is straight and lank, that of the 2d is flowing or 

 curling, and th it of the 3rd is crisp or frizzled, and sometimes spirally curled. 



4th. The pile of the 2d class has its coloring matter in a central canal, but I 

 have never been able to detect any central canal in either of the other classes ; 

 their coloring matter appears to me to be disseminated in the cortex and inter- 

 mediate fibres. 



'ith. The cortex of the pile of all three classes is squamose ; but the scales on 

 the 1st and 2d classes are less numerous, are rounded at the anterior extremity, 

 and adhere closely to the shaft ; but those of the 3rd class are more numerous, 

 pointed, and not so closely set to the shaft. 



Cth. That there are two distinct species of sheep, as determined by their pile, 

 viz. the hairy sheep, and the woolly sheep. The pile of the hairy sheep will 

 not felt nor full ; the wool of the woolly sheep will do both. 



7th. Upon the heads of hybrids formed by the crossing of any two of the spe- 

 cies of man above mentioned, are found separate filaments belonging to their two 

 classes respectively ; and upon the head of a double hybrid, | which I examined, 

 I found filaments belonging respectively to all three classes. 



An instrument invented by Mr. Brown for determining the ductility, elasticity, 

 and tenacity of filaments, 

 t One who had the blood of all three classes. 




14.6 [Fkb. 



9th. All hair is not polaric. 



10th. 'I'here are various degrees of the felting property in wool, which may 

 be detern:iined by the aid of the microscope, as they depend upon the number, 

 shape and adherence of the scales. 



11th. The softness of any woolly fabric, is in exact proportion to the ductiliit/ 

 and elasticity of the filaments of which it is composed ; and the ductility and 

 elasticity of the fibre can be accurately determined by the trichometer. 



12th. The method in common use of determining the diameter of any filament 

 that is not cylindrical is inaccurate, for every filament that is not cylindrical 

 has two diameters, which cannot be accurately determined, except by using 

 transverse sections. 



13th, That in all cases of doubt or difliculty, whether a filament is or is not a 

 true hair, it can be determined with the trichometer. 



1 1th. The button of the pile of the head of man changes its shape and color in 

 diseases of the hair, and in diseases of the skin that affect the hair. 



15th. The buttons of the pile of the head of lunatics differ from those of the 

 sane. 



16th. There is no difference between the wool found upon the head of a pure 

 negro, and that found upon the back of a woolly sheep, except in the degree of the 

 felting power possessed by them. 



Dr. Morton in remarking upon the cranium of the Dijak deposited 

 by him this evening, referred to the great difficulty in obtaining these 

 crania, and stated that Mr. Wra. Gliddon, from whom he had derived 

 the present specimen, had been unable, during many years residence 

 in Borneo, to induce the natives to part with any of their trophy skulls 

 upon any consideration. This had been carried off by a Dutch officer 

 on a warlike expedition. 



Dr. Morton announced the decease of Mr. John J. Audubon, a member 

 of this Society; and after some appropriate observations upon the life 

 and chE?racter of this distinguished zoologist, moved the following 

 Resolutions, which were unanimously adopted : 



Resolved, That this Society has heard with profound regret of the 

 death of their esteemed and venerable colleague, John James Audubon, 

 at his residence near the city of New York, on the 27th ultimo. 



Resolved, That by the demise of this truly great man, Science has 

 lost one of her most zealous and gifted disciples, and the Arts, a master 

 in the branch which he cultivated. 



Resolved. That we recognise in Mr. Audubon a man who has happily 

 lived to fulfil his destiny as an explorer of the great field of American 

 Zoology, while the splendid volumes which are the fruit of his labors, 

 will diffuse the knowledge and the love of science to the latest genera- 

 tions. 



Resolved, That a copy of these Resolutions, signed by the officers, 

 together with the sympathy of the members of this Society, be respect- 

 fully tendered to the family of Mr. Audubon. 



On leave granted, the Committee, to whom was referred the paper 




1851.] 147 



of Dr. Woodhouse, read January 7th, 1851, describing a new species 

 of Jackal, presented a report, recommending the same for publica- 

 tion in the Proceedings and Journal, with some additional remarks on 

 the subject by the Chairman, Dr. J. C. Fisher, which was adopted. 



The North American Jackal Canis Frusteor. 

 By S. W. Woodhouse, M. D. 



Char. Esseiit. Hair cinereous grey, varied with black above. Longer on the 

 vertebral line, legs fulvous. 



Dimensions. Total length from the tip of the nose including the tail, with the 

 exception of the hair at the tip, two feet seven inches; trunk of the tail eight 

 and three-tenths inches; total length of ears four and three-tenths inches; length 

 of fore leg nine inches ; from the anterior canthus of the eye to the tip of the 

 nose two and seven-tenths inches ; from anterior angle of ear to posterior canthus 

 of the eye two and four-tenths inches ; between the anterior angles of the ears 

 two and live-tenths inches. 



Description. Hair at base fulvous and woolly, middle of its length white and 

 tipped with black; ears erect, pointed at tip, cinnamon color behind and at the base; 

 inside dirty white, sides paler than the back, belly brownish white, breast brown, 

 chin white, legs cinnamon color; the nose from the eyes to the tip cinnamon 

 color. Cheeks grey; space between the ears reddish brown; tail fulvous below, 

 dark grey above, black at tip, slightly bushy; iris light brown, lips white tipped 

 with black ; it has three series of setas on the upper lip, above the eyes, and on 

 the sides of the cheeks. 



The most remarkable difference exists in the skull of this animal, which 

 more closely resembles the Jackal of the Old World than any known species of 

 wolf. But as Dr. Morton is now engased on a memoir in which the cranial 

 characteristics of the American wolves will be compared with those of the Canis 

 lupus of Europe, I leave this part of the subject in his hands. 



Hahil$. T\\\% animal I first saw at Fort Gibson, on the Neosho river. They 

 frequent this place at night in numbers, making their way to a ditch where the 

 offals of the garrison are thrown. Their baik is sharp like that of a terrier, fol- 

 lowed in quick succession, then a prolonged cry much like that of the hound. 



Four or five of them make as much noise as twice their number of terrier dogs, 

 so that a stranger on hearing them is apt to be deceived as to their number. I 

 have seen them on all parts of the prairie, but they appear to be more abundant 

 near the settlements. 



They prowled frequently about our camp at night, keeping up an incessant 

 barking. 



I procured a male and female; these I regret to say have not lost their milk 

 teeth, but they have attained their full growth, as I have seen numbers of them. 



On showing them to Dr. Townsend, he recognised them immediately, and said 

 that he had seen them frequently on the plains of the Missouri, but never beyond 

 the mountains. 



This animal has hitherto been confounded with the Canis latrans of Say. 



Observations by the Commiliee. 

 The Committee are much gratified with this paper, as it assists in throwing 



20 




148 ' [Feb. 



light upon a point in the Natural History of the wolves of North America, which has 

 heretofoie been involved in obscurity. Before the description of the Lupus Gigas 

 of North America, by Dr. Townsend, all the varieties of wolves in this country 

 were referred by naturalists to two species, the Lupus occidentalis or common wolf, 

 and the Lupus latrans, or prairie wolf. Sir John Richardson was the first who un- 

 equivocally described the wolves of North America, as distinct from the European 

 or Pyrenean wolf. The great majority of naturalists who have noticed the wolves 

 of this continent, ineluding Grey, Agassiz, De Kay, &c., agree with him in con- 

 sidering them as entirely distinct species from the wolves of the Eastern Conti- 

 nent.* With the exception of the " large brown wolf," of Lewis and Clarke, 

 they all refer the American wolves of every variety to the two species named 

 Lupus occidentalis, and Lupus latrans. It was scarcely possible to reconcile 

 the various descriptions of the diH'erent wolves classed under the last of these. 

 Lupus latrans, as belonging to the same animal. The Lupus latrans of Say, 

 found on the Lpper Missouri and the Saskechawan,is classed by Richardsonf with 

 the Californian Ochropus, and the Mexican nigrirostis, (known also as the 

 Coyote.) He has given a figure of the Lupus latrans, which agrees exactly with 

 a specimen in the possession of the Aca(^en)y. 



The figure given by Audubon in his Quadrupeds of North America, Plate 71st, 

 does 7iot agree with Richardson's, or with the specimen above referred to, but does 

 agree very closely with the Canis frustror, in color, shape, &c. It is an excel- 

 lent drawing of the last mentioned animal. The Coyote of Mexico and Califor- 

 nia, has been, we believe, uniformly referred by naturalists to the Lupus latrans, 

 and the drawing of Audubon appears to have been made from it, considered as an 

 undoubted Prairie wolf. The figure of the Hare Indian dog of Richardsouj the 

 Canis familiaris lagopus, bears a very striking resemblance to the Lupus 

 latrans of Audubon, and the Canis frustror of Woodhouse. We are inclined 

 from the figure, measurements and description of the voice, to consider this dog 

 as the analogue among our domestic animals of the Canis frustror or Coyote, if 

 it be not the same animal merely domesticated. From the Canis frustror hunt- 

 ing so uniformly in packs of considerable numbers, as well as its size, it is more 

 nearly allied to the Jackal than the wolf. It is decidedly gregarious in its habits. 

 We hope that the Academy will soon possess good specimens of all the wolves 

 of this continent, so that a more strict comparison may be made, and this ques- 

 tion of species be definitely settled. At present we may consider the following 

 species as clearly established, viz: Lupus gigas. Lupus occidentalis, Lupus 

 latrans, and Canis frustror.

Dr. Morton on the subject of the Lobos, Coyote, and Indian dogs. This 

 letter was received by Dr. Morton on the 5th inst., and enclosed 

 another in the French lano-uasce from Dr. Louis Berlandier to Dr. Jar- 

 vis, dated Matamoras, Jan. .oth, 1851, with accompanying descriptions 

 of several species of Canis indigenous to Mexico. Dr. Berlandier's, 

 knowledge and means of information on this subject had been very 

 extensive, and his descriptions were well worthy the notice of the 

 Society. His letter and descriptions were on motion referred to the 

 Committee who had had charge of Dr. Woodhouse's paper, viz., Dr. 

 J. C. Fisher, Dr. Leidy, and Dr. iMorton. 



Mr. Cassin stated on behalf of the committee having in charge Dr. 

 T. C, Henry's paper describing a new species of Fish from Oswego 

 Lake, N. Y., that a more extended communication had been received 

 from the author by the Committee. 



Mr. Cassin read a paper intended for publication in the Proceedings 

 entitled, '' Sketch of the Birds composing the genera Vireo Vieill. and

Ohs. It appears upon the authority of Wilson that this is the Muscicapa canta- 

 trix, Bartram That name, even if it had priority, is not entitled to adoption, not 

 being accompanied by any description w-hatever. The name alluded to is given 

 with many others, in " Travels through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East 

 and West Florida," &c., by William Bartram, Philadelphia, 1791, (octavo, 1 

 vol.,) p, 291. According to my views the authority for M. cantatrix should be 

 Wilson, he having first defined the species, though very probably upon the desig- 

 nation of the celebrated Bartram himself. I do not mean to say, however, that 

 none of the names of the latter ought to be adopted, for there a few of the species 

 named by him, to which are attached sufficient descriptions, and which 1 hope to 

 designate in an early paper. 



4. Vireo Bella. And. B. of Am. Octavo edition, vii, p. 333, pi. 485, (1844.) 

 Dimensions. 5 Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail 4 6-lOths 



inches, wing 2 3 lOtlis, tail 2 inches. 



Colors. 5 Under mandible, viewed from below, yellowish white, superior 

 mandible light brown. Shafts of the quills on the inferior surface of the wing, 

 white. Entire plumage above light olive tinged with greyish brown on the head, 

 wings and tail brown, the feathers of both of which are edged externally with 

 pale yellowish green, quills with their inner webs narrowly edged with yellowish 

 white. Greater and lesser wing coverts conspicuously tinged with the same 

 color. Plumage of the entire under parts of the body pale yellowish white, run- 

 ning into pure yellow on the sides and inferior tail coverts. Nares and ring 

 around the eye yellowish white. Tarsi and feet dark. 



9 . Slightly smaller, colors paler, head inclining to cinereous, under parts 

 nearly white. 



Hab. Western side of North America. 



Obs. The smallest of the birds of this genus. It was discovered by Mr. 

 Audubon on the Upper Missouri river, during the last expedition accomplished 

 by him, and has since been found in California by Mr. John G. Bell, after whom 

 it is named. The descriptions above are from the specimens of the latter gentle- 

 man and from the originals of Mr. A udubon, which were presented to the Academy 

 by his friend and associate Mr. Edward Harris. 



5. Vireo Hiitto7ti, nobis. 



Form. Robust and rather broad, generally similar to that of V. novebora- 

 censis. 




1851.] 151 



Dimensions. J Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail 4 9-lOths 

 inches, wing 2 4-lOths, tail 2 inches. 



Colors. 5 . Undpr nnandible viewed from below, dark horn color, superior 

 mandible nearly black. Shafts of quills on the inferior surface of the wing dark 

 brown. Entire plumage above light olive green, inclining to yellowish on the 

 rump and upper tail coverts. Greater and lesser wing coverts broadly tipped 

 with white, appearing to form two conspicuous bars on the wing; quills brown 

 externally, narrowly edged with yellowish green, and internally edged with white, 

 conspicuous when viewed from below. Plumage of the entire under parts greenish 

 cream color, (very delicate and peculiar,) inclining to yellowish on the flanks. 

 Nares and ring around the eyes yellowish white. Tarsi and feet dark. "Iris 

 dark hazel, feet blue." 



9 Slightly smaller, very similar in color to the male. 



iTai. Monterey, California, (Mr. W. Hutton.) Georgetown, California, (Mr. 

 J.G.Bell.) 



Obs. This species of Vireo may be recognized without difficulty by the very 

 delicate cream color of the entire under surface of its body, which color I have 

 never seen in any other bird. In other respects it somewhat resembles Vireo 

 Bellii, though it appears to be a stouter and more robust bird ; the only specimen 

 in the collection of the Academy is that of Mr. Bell ; there are two others in the 

 collection of the Smithsonian Institution, to which they were presented with many 

 other birds, by Mr. William Hutton, a zealous and talented young naturalist now 

 resident at San Diego, in California, in honor of whom I hav^e taken the liberty 

 of naming it. 



Mr. Bell's remarks on this species are as follows: "I shot this bird at George- 

 town, October 15th, 1849. My attention was attracted to it by its song, which 

 somewhat resembled that of the warbling Vireo, (F. gilvus,) though the differ- 

 ence could easily be detected. It was in a very high pine tree, and the only 

 specimen that I ever saw or heard. The country was hilly, and covered with 

 a few oaks. This bird was a male."

Obs. This species is very similar to the preceding in color, but is smaller, its 

 wings are shorter and its plumage is of more vivid green. The under parts of 

 the body are tinged with yellow, especially the inferior tail coverts, much more 

 than in V.olivaceus. It appears to be a common bird in South America, and I have 

 seen specimens said to be from Trinidad. The best descriptions extant of this 




152 [Feb. 



species are those of Swainson, as cited, and of Audubon in Ornith. Biog. v., p. 296. 

 I am not without suspicion that tliis is the bird figured by Wilson, as above.

Hah. Florida, West Indies, and South America. 



Ohs. A species also considerably resembling r. olivacea, hut larger and with 

 the bill distinctly longer. It is easily distinguished by the narrow black lines 

 running downwards from the corners of the lower mandible. 



This is the largest of all the species yet discovered, and was first obtained within 

 the present limits of the United States, by Dr. A. L. Heermann, in Florida. It is 

 probably the bird alluded to by Mr. Gosse, in his delightful volume on the Birds 

 of Jamaica, though I can only judge by the measurements given by him which 

 are too large for V. olivaceus. Mr. Gosse appears though to have had access 

 to the plate of Audubon and possibly that of Wilson. He gives no detailed de- 

 scription. Nuttall, in Manuel i., p. 360, (1840,) says "the V. olivaceus has never 

 yet been found in those islands," (the West Indies,) but it does not appear to me to 

 be impossible at all that it may be, as Audubon met with it in Florida and Loui- 

 siana. (^Orn. Biog. II., p. 288.) 



4. Vireosylvia Jlavoviridis, nobis. Buff. PI. Enl. 558, fig 2 ? 



Form. Generally resembling that of V. altiloqua, but is rather smaller, the 

 wings and legs are shorter, and the latter much less robust, the bill is also slightly 

 more slender. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail 5h inches, 

 wing 3 and 2-lOths, tail 2 and 2-lOth inches. 



Colors. Head above pale cinereous, superciliary stripes pale ashy-white, 

 not so distinctly defined as in V. altiloqiia. Entire plumage of the body above 

 fine yellowish olive, wings and tail brown with their feathers widely margined 

 externally with the same yellowish olive and internally with yellowish white. 

 Sides of the neck and of the body beneath, inferior wing and inferior tail coverts 

 fine greenish yellow, middle of the body beneath from the base of the bill to the 

 abdomen pure white. Upper mandible lead color, lower white. No black lines 

 from the base of the lower mandible, and general color of the body above much 

 more vivid than in V. altiloqua. Trides red. 



$ Rather smaller and colors paler. 



Kab. Panama, where it was obtained by Mr. John G. Bell, and San Juan de 

 Nicaragua, from whence it was sent to this Academy by Mr. A. de Barruel. 



Ohs. This is a very handsome species, much more brightly colored, and with- 

 out the black lines on the front of the neck which characterize the V. altiloqua. 

 Four specimens are in the collection of the Academy. 



Mr. Bell represents this bird as having been rather common near Panama in 

 May, 1849, and that in habits and song it much resembled the red-eye, (F. 

 olivaKea.'^

 Hab. The whole of North America. 



6. Vireosylvia philadelphica, nobis. 



Form. Generally somewhat resembling that of V. gUva, but is smaller, with 

 the bill much shorter, and the form generally shorter and stouter. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail 4| inches, 

 wing 2 and 6-lOths, tail 2 inches. 



Cotois. Line over the eye pale greenish white, very distinct. Entire upper 

 parts olive green, inclining to ash on the head, quills and tail feathers brown, 

 narrowly edged with green. Under parts pale yellowish white, shading into 

 greenish upon the sides. Nares dark, bill horn color. 



Hab. Near Philadelphia. 



Obs. This small species resembles V. gilva more than it does any other 

 species, but is smaller and can at once be distinguished by its much shorter and 

 weak bill. Its colors are more vivid and the superciliary line more distinct. 



I shot the bird now described in Bingham's woods near Philadelphia in Septem- 

 ber, 1842, but have never seen another specimen. It was in the upper branches 

 of a tree of considerable heighth, engaged in capturing insects, and attracted my 

 attention by its slow and apparently deliberate movements. 



III. Notice of species which I have not seen, and general observations. 



1. Vireo versicolor. Hartlaub. Revue Zoologique, 1843, p. 289. 



Orig. descrip. " Supra olivaceo-viridis, pileo toto nuchaque nigricante-plum- 

 beis ; plumulis ciliaribus dilute flavis, tectriclbus alae majoribus rufis; remigibus 

 primariis angustissime, secundariis latins rufo marginatis, tertiariis pogonio ex- 

 terno pallide fulvis; flexura alas flavo et olivaceo variegata ; subtus flavus, gula 

 collo antico pectoreque fasciolis multis interruptis et irregularibus olivaceis 

 transversim variegatis ; cauda nigricante, rostro obscure plumbeo; mandibulae 

 tomiis apiceque albidis, pedibus nigris. Long. 4i. La plus petite espece du 

 genre." 



Above olive green, with the head above and nape blackish lead color, ciliary 

 feathers pale yellow, greater wing coverts rufous, primaries very narrowly, 

 secondaries more broadly margined with rufous, tertiaries with their external 

 webs pale fulvous, flexure of the wing variegated with yellow and olive; beneath 

 yellow, throat, neck before and breast with many interrupted and irregular trans- 

 verse little lines of olive, tail blackish, bill obscure lead color, edges of the man- 

 dibles and apex white, feet black. Length about 5 inches, (4f inches French.) 

 The smallest species of the genus. 



Obs. This bird must be quite different in general appearance from any other 

 of either of the genera Vireo or Vireosylvia. Its rufous wing coverts and broad 

 margins of the secondaries also rufous are quite peculiar. 



M. Hartlaub is mistaken about this being the smallest of the genus. There 

 are at least three species which are smaller.

 for the Adv. of Science, (in Sixth Rep. Brit. Assoc. 1837, p. 172.) 



Sylvia Vigorsii. Aud. Orn. Biog. 1 p. 103, pi. 30. 



Ohs. Audubon's figure has a Vireo-like look, and ought to be remembered. 

 In his Synopsis, p. 55, he places this name as a synonyme for Sylvicola pinus, 

 (Lath.) 



3. Vireosylva is the orthography of M. Bonaparte in Geog. and Comp. List, 

 p. 26, but in Conspectus Avium, p. 329, he makes it Vireosylvia, the former 

 being apparently a typographical error. It is a very natural and easily defined 

 genus, and was first pointed out by this deservedly celebrated naturalist in the 

 edition of the work cited which was published in 1838. In Erichson's Archiv^ 



>ty'X,-^^-k^ x'i'- P- 321, (1847,) Mr. Cabani^necessarily proposes the name Phyllomanes as a 

 substitute. 



Descriptions of 7iew species of birds of the genera Galbida and Bueco, Briss., 

 specimens of which are in the collection of the Academy of Natural Scie?ices of 

 PIi iladelphia . 



By John Cassin. 



1. Galbida cyanicollis, nobis. 



Form. Not essentially different from that of other short-tailed species. Rather 

 stout, space from the bill around the eye bare and conspicuous, middle tail 

 feathers but slightly longest. 



Dimensions, Total length of skin from top of bill to end of tail 7^ inches, 

 wing 3 and 1-lOth, tail 3 inches. 



Colours. Head above blue with golden olive reflections, the same color, blue, 

 extends from the base of the bill upon the neck beneath the bare space around 

 the eye, bordering (upon the neck only) the deep reddish brown of the entire 

 under surface of the body. Entire plumage above and two middle tail feathers 

 golden-green, very brilliant, and inclining to red in some lights. Outer tail 

 feathers reddish brown, slightly edged externally with golden-green, quills black, 

 primaries narrowly and secondaries broadly edged on their inner webs with 

 brown, rather paler than that of the body beneath. A trace of a green collar 

 on the neck in front. 



Tip of upper mandible black, basal portion of upper, whole of under mandible 

 (space around the eye and feet ?) yellow. 



Hab. Para, Brazil. 



Obs. This species is related to G. chalcocephala, Deville, and G. albirostris. 

 Lath. I am acquainted with no other species in which the head and neck are 

 blue as above described. Several specimens are in the collection, all of which 

 are from Para. 



2. Bncco Ordii, nobis. 



Form. Generally short and robust, feathers of the head but little elongated, 

 wings and tail short. A strict congener of B. macrorhynchus and pectoralis. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail ll inches, 

 wing 3 and 3-lOths, tail 2 and 8-lOth inches. 



Colors. Tail with a central transverse white bar. Breast with a narrow band 

 of black, immediately succeeded by another much wider of dark chesnut-brown. 




1851.] 155 



throat and abdomen white, which is the color also of the frontal feathers of the 

 internal webs of the primaries at their bases, and of a narrow collar on the back of 

 the neck. Entire superior surface of the head, body, wings, and tail black, with a 

 greenish gloss. Tail with a band of white most observable on the inner webs of the 

 feathers, and narrowly edged with white at its end. Flanks striped with the 

 same dark brown as the broader belt of the breast. 



Hab. Venezuela. 



Obs. A bird resembling generally the several species of which Bucco macro- 

 rhynchus, Gm. is a representative, but immediately recognizable by the white bar 

 in its tail and its smaller size. I have seen only the specimen now described. '^ 



I have taken the liberty of naming this bird as a trifling tribute of respect to 

 Mr. George Ord of this city, the Nestor of American naturalists, the early and 

 constant friend and biographer of the great Alexander Wilson.

The Committee, to whom the paper of Dr Berlandier, read to the 

 Academy Feb llth, 1851, describing two species of Mexican wolves, 

 was referred, reported : 



That after a careful examination, they are satisfied that the first, the Cams 

 Mexicanus of Desmarest, No. 297, and the Lupus Mexicanus of Col. Hamilton 

 Smith, Vol. 9th, Mammalia Nat. Lib., though heretofore considered by Richard- 

 son and others as a variety of the common wolf, Lupus occidentalis, is yet, from 

 its peculiarly marked form, entitled to be considered a distinct species. As this 

 wolf has been described and figured in the work referred to, it would only be 

 unnecessarily multiplying its synonyms to publish a new name for it, unless 

 stronger reasons be given than exist in the present case. The second is unques- 

 tionably the one described by Dr. Woodhouse, under the name of Canis frustror, 

 in a paper read to the Academy, Jan. 7th, 1851, and directed to be published in 

 the Proceedings and in the Journal of the Academy. The same objection, the 

 unnecessary multiplication of synonyms, also applies to the publication of the 

 name given by Dr. Berlandier to this wolf. Although Dr. Woodhouse is entitled 

 by priority of publication to the right of giving the specific name, yet the Com- 

 mittee feel unwilling to report against the publication of this part of the paper, 

 especially as it strongly corroborates the views expressed by them in the remarks 

 made on the Canis frustror. Considering the description of the first also as im- 




1851.] 157 



portant in establishing the claim of the Lupus Mexicanus to be ranked as a distinct 

 species, and not as a variety, the Committee would recommend the publication of 

 the translation of the paper of Dr. Berlandier, omitting the specific names ffiven by 

 him, in the Proceedings of the Academy. 



Canis Mexicanis, Desm. 297. 



Head elongated, reddish-grey, with a blackish band upon the forehead, not dis. 

 tinctly defined; ears reddish, a little darker upo'i the anterior margin; bark mix- 

 ture of ashy-grey; dirty red and blackish bands, which extend a little upon the 

 flanks; a mane ; ahdomeu dirty light-red ; tail reddish, black above, very much 

 tufted, and terminated by black hairs, not pendulous. 



It inliabits almost the whole of Mexico, and is common in desert localities, 

 particularly in the shore regions of the Gulf of Mexico. It is found also upon the 

 central plateau. 



It is as susceptible of being tamed as a dog; (those which I have raised were 

 very good as watch dogs) it lives on good terms with the domestic animals. It 

 howls principally at night when the weather is about to change. This wolf is 

 celebrated for his cunning, his vivacity and his habits. All the inhabitants bg. 

 stow upon him in a high degree these first qualities. 



Total length from the end of the nose to the extremity of the tail, 4 feet 6

'o' 



Canis frustror, Woodhouse. 



Size of the common fox, (Canis vulpes) or a little larger; reddish-grey; a black- 

 ish-grey mane along the back, shaded with black upon the shoulders ; ears cinna- 

 mon-red ; anterior feet red, in front blackish ; extremity of the tail blackish. 



Inhabits all the plains, more or less wooded, of Tamaulipas, New-Leon, 

 Coahuila, and of Texas ; is again found in greater or less abundance throughout 

 the whole of Mexico, and perhaps also in the greater part of North America. 



It is susceptible of being tamed, but preserves a distrustful character. It does 

 not howl like the wolf, and its cry is rather a yelping bark, which is heard in 

 the evening and also early in the morning. 



Total length fram the end of the nose to the extremity of the tail 3 feet 4 inches 

 French. Height of the shoulder 1 foot 1 inch. 



Mammal very cowardly, but also perhaps the most cunning.

March 4<f,h,lS5l. 

 Dr, Morton, President, in the Chair. 



Letters were read from the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, 

 dated Washington, July 3d, 1851, and from the Librarian of the 

 British Museum, dated Jan. 18th, 1851, severally acknov/ledging the 

 receipt of late Nos. of the Proceedings of the Academy. 



Also a letter from the Asiatic Society of Bengal, dated June 7th, 

 1850, acknowledging the receipt of Part 4, Vol. 1, new series of the 

 Journal. 



Dr. Morton offered some remarks on the Dikaj and other crania 

 deposited by him this evening. 



Mr. Cassin offered the following, which were unanimously agreed 

 to : 



Whereas, This Society has recently sustained the loss of a distin- 

 guished and valued member. Dr. John K. Townsend, late of this city, 



Resolved, That the acquirements of the late Dr. Townsend, and his 

 zeal and enterprise as a scientific traveller, entitle him, in the opinion 

 of this Society, to a high rank as a naturalist and explorer of the 

 natural history of this country. 



Resolved, That this Society hereby acknowledges with cheerfulness 

 and gratitude its obligations to Dr. Townsend for many interesting and 

 important contributions to its collections, especially of the Birds and 

 Quadrupeds of Western America, and his valuable papers relative 

 thereto published. 



Resolved, That a copy of these Resolutions be communicated to the 

 family of our deceased fellow member. 



March 1 Uh. 



Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



A letter was read from the Corresponding Secretary of the Historical 

 Society of Pennsylvania, dated March 10, 1851, transmitting a resolu- 

 tion which had been adopted by that Society to request of the Academy 

 of Natural Sciences the deposit in their Library of the copy of the Paris 

 "Moniteur" belonging to the Academy. Referred to the Library 

 Committee. 



March l8th. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



A circular was read, dated March 14th, 1851, from the Executors 

 of the late Mrs. Elizabeth Stott, informing the Legatees that they were 

 now prepared to discharge the payment of the legacies as soon as they 

 were furnished with the refunding bonds. On motion, therefore, 



Resolved, That the Treasurer, Geo. W. Carpenter, be authorized to 



PEOCEED. ACAD. NAT. SCI. OF PHILADELPHIA. VOL. V. NO. Vllt. 23 




170 [April, 



receive from the Executors of the late Mrs. Stott the amount of her 

 legacy to this Institution, and to execute the necessary bonds on pay- 

 ment of the same. 



April 1st. 

 Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



Dr. Morton read a letter addressed to him, from Dr. Alfred T. King, 

 dated Greensburg, Pa., March 17, 1851, on the subject of the anatomy 

 and functions of the brain in the inferior animals. 



Dr. Morton, referring to the crania deposited by him this evening, 

 stated that the cranium of the mummy recently dissected by Mr- Glid- 

 don was that of a female, and an Eg3'ptian in every respect. An at- 

 tempt had been made to preserve all the bones, but upon some of them 

 having been vi^etted, they were entirely converted into a clay-like 

 mass; the cranium had, however, escaped. One of the Tapajos In- 

 dian crania was curiously embalmed, in a manner peculiar to these 

 people, who place several together in jars : the eyes are singularly 

 represented, and the skull presents the peculiar roundness of the pos- 

 terior portion which is common to this race. The cranium of the 

 Guayacuru (a youns female) was interesting from the great rarity of 

 these crania. 



The following, offered by Dr. Elwyn, was adopted : 



Whereas, Mr. George Ord has kindly consented, at the request of 

 members of the Academy, to place at its disposal a portrait of himself 

 now in his possession : 



Resolved, That the Recording Secretary be directed to correspond 

 with Mr. Ord on the subject, and to signify to him the gratification it 

 would afford the Society to receive the portrait. 



April 8th. 

 Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



Dr. Leidy exhibited three fragments of the inferior maxilla of a gigan- 

 tic species of Palreotherium, to which in the last number of the Pro- 

 ceedings he had given the name P. Proutii, in honor of Dr. Hiram A- 

 Prout, of St. Louis. By the latter gentleman they had been obligingly 

 lent to him through Prof. Baird of the Smithsonian Institute. One of 

 them had been described by Dr. Prout in Silliman's Journal, the others 

 had been since obtained. Two of the fragments apparently belonged to 

 the same individual, viz. : that described by Dr. Prout, being a portion of 

 the left ramus, containing the seventh molar tooth nearly entire and 

 the preceding teeth much mutilated ; and a part of the right ramus ex- 

 tending back to the angle containing three posterior molars mutilated. 

 They correspond closely in appearance, age, and size. The third frag- 

 ment is a much mutilated posterior molar of the right side, rather larger 

 than the corresponding tooth of the above specimens. The posterior 




1851.] 171 



molar measures antero-posteriorly 4J inches, the sixth molar 3j, and 

 the fifth molar has been about 3J inches. The angle of the jaw is 

 eight inches behind the posterior molar. The lower jaw has been full 

 two and a half feet long, and belonged to an animal three times the 

 size of the Pahieotherium magnum of Cuvier. 



Prof. Bairdhas also sent three fossil Tortoises from the same locality, 

 one of which Dr. Leidy oelieved to be a new genus. 



Mr. Lea stated that he had examined the fossil bones of a reptilian quadruped , 

 which Dr. J. Y. Shelley had sent to the Academy in Nov., 1847, from Upper 

 Milford, Lehigh Co., Pa., on Hassac's Creek, a tributary to the Perkiomen. 

 The notice of Dr. Shelley's donation, published in No. 7, Vol. 5, of the Proceed- 

 ings, as part of the Annual Report of the Recording Secretary, had not met Mr. 

 Lea's view until within a few days, it being there remarked, that these remains 

 were from a formation probably anterior to the coal. 



The great interest which attaches to all these sauroid remains, induced Mr. 

 Lea to examine the specimens in the Cabinet of the Academy, when he was per- 

 fectly satisfied by the lithological characters of the nr.atrix, and by the geogra- 

 phical position of the locality, that the epoch of the existence of this reptilian 

 quadruped had been misapprehended. The matrix was found to be carbonate of 

 lime, in the form of a conglomerate, and the locality near to the range of the 

 trappean hills, known as the "Conewago Hills" in Pennsylvania, and as the 

 Blue Mountains in Virginia. On the south of these intruded rocks, lies the 

 formation known by the geologists of the United States, generally, as the New 

 Red S%7idstone, although Elie de Boumont, and Dr. Jackson, of Boston, are not 

 of the opinion that it is the equivalent of the Trias or upper new red sandstone, 

 or the Permian or lower new red sandstone of Europe. Certain it is, however, 

 that this red sandstone formation, which stretches in a long and narrovi^ band, 

 from South Carolina to the Connecticut yver, and exists probably at Truro 

 in Nova Scotia, sometimes with considerable interruptions, has been found 

 to contain the foot prints of numerous genera and species of birds, and of 

 reptiles, as well as a large number of fishes. These have been chiefly ob- 

 served on the Connecticut river. But until now there had not been found in 

 this formation in the United States, so far as he knew, any hones of the ani- 

 mals which then inhabited its shores. It is well ascertained, that this calcareous 

 conglomerate forms the upper portion of the so-called new red sandstone forma- 

 tion, and lies on its northern border, appearing at various points : in the N. E. 

 part of New Jersey at Pompton, westwardly at Germantown in the same State, 

 and it is found crossing the Delaware at Spring Mills about 15 miles below 

 Easton. It is recognised at the locality, where these bones were found, in the 

 S. E. corner of Lehigh county, and in the same line south-westward, below 

 Reading, about one mile, where it exists in very large masses, the line of the 

 Philadelphia and Reading railroad making a deep cut through it. It there ex- 

 hibits its structure as a very coarse calcareous conglomerate of various colors. 

 In the same direction it is found on the Potomac river, and is known there as the 

 Potomac marble, of which the columns of the Halls of Congress are made. 



Mr. Lea remarked that it was greatly to be regretted, that all the bones of this 

 specimen had not been obtained, but it was due to Dr. Shelley to say that he 




l''"-^ [April, 



arrested from destruction and handed over to scientific investigation, with a 

 promptness that does him credit, what remained to be obtained. The rocks had 

 been taken out for the purpose of making the bed of a turnpike road, and the bones 

 now in possession of the Academy consist of several vertebrce, parts of ribs and 

 two imperfect teeth, which certainly place this animal amono; the Sanrians. 



To these remains, so fortunately preserved, Mr. Lea proposes to give a mature 

 examination, and the curators have placed them under his charge for that pur- 

 pose. When prepared, a description and figures of the important portions of 

 these bones will be submitted by him for publication in the Journal of the 

 Academy. 



Mi. Lea thou^jht it better to adopt a specific name without delay, but deemed 

 it advisable to postpone a generic one, until a further examination shall prove the 

 diagnosis, and then apply a descriptive one. He proposes Pennsylv aniens as the 

 specific name. 



On leave granted, a memorial to the Legislature of Pennsylvania, 

 praying for the passage of an act authorising the completion and pub- 

 lication of the final report of the Geological Survey ai the State, was 

 presented and read. On motion, the same was adopted, and a copy 

 fiigned by the officers of the Academy was ordered to be transmitted 

 to the Legislature now in session. 



Afril 15th. 

 Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



A letter was read from the Royal Leopoldine Carolinian Academy 

 of Naturalists, dated Breslau, Jan. 21st, 1851, acknowledging the 

 receipt of late Nos. of the Proceedings. 



A letter was read from J. S. Gossler, Esq., dated Harrisburg, April 

 11th, 1851, acknowledging the receipt of the memorial addressed to 

 the Legislature by the Academy on the subject of the State Geological 

 Survey ; also another from the same, dated April 12th, 1851, announ- 

 cing the passage of the law by both Houses authorising the publication 

 of the Eeport. 



Dr. Leidy presented for the inspection of the members a fossil Tortoise from 

 Nebraska Territory, received through Prof. Baird of the Smithsonian Institution. 

 The specimen consisted of four-fifths of the carapace and plastron, the former 

 considerably crushed. In general form it is like the genus Erays. It has been 

 about 7 inches in length, and about 5} in breadth ; its heighth is about 21 inches. 

 An interval of one-eighth of an inch between the costal and marginal plates has 

 been filled with cartilage. The union in the middle line of the sternum from 

 behind to the ento-sternal bone has also been cartilaginous. The outer extremi- 

 ties of the costal plates are alternately broad and narrow as in Testudo. The 

 most remarkable peculiarity of the animal has been the possession of four ac- 

 cessory bones, which do not exist in other genera. These bones give additional 

 support to the carapace. Two are placed anterior to the attachment of the ster- 

 num to the marginal plates, and two posterior. The anterior are nearly straight 




1851.] 173 



and quadrilateral, and pass, one upon each side, from the antero-external angle 

 of the hyo-sternal bone obliquely upwards ami inwards to a depression about the 

 middle of the outer margin of the first costal plate. The posterior column? of 

 support have nearly the same form as the anterior, and pass from the postero- 

 external angle of the hypo-sternal bone upwards, backwards and a little inwards 

 to a depression formed at the junction of the fifth and sixth costal plates. Dr. 

 L. gave to this fossil the generic and specific name of Stylemys* nebrascensis. 



^pril 2'2d. 

 Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



A letter was read from Mr. John Hooper, Secretary of the Brooklyn 

 Institute, dated New York, Feb. 17th, 1851 , accompanying a beautiful 

 collection of native Algfc, (42 species,) presented by him to the Aca- 

 demy, and offering to contribute further if desirable. 



Mr. Cassin read a paper intended for publication in the Proceedings, 

 entitled "Notes of an Examination of the Birds composing the family 

 Caprimulgidre in the collection of the Acad. Nat. Sciences ;" which 

 was referred to Dr. Wilson, Dr. Watson and Dr. Ruschenberger. 



Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to two fossil Tortoises from 

 Nebraska Territory, received through Professor Baird. 



One of them consists of a great portion of the carapace and sternum broken 

 into two fragments. It belongs to the genus Testudo. Its length has been 

 about 2 feet, the breadth is 20 inches, and the height 9 inches. The bones are 

 thick and strong. The species Dr. L named Testudo lata. 



The second specimen consists of four-iifths of the sternum and about one-third 

 of the carapax. In its perfect state it has been about 9i inches in length, 7i in 

 breadth, and about 5h hish. The carapace is very convex. The costal plates 

 are alternately narrow and broad at their outer extremity, and have been united 

 to the marginal plates by cartilage. The latter rise at first a little convex from 

 the sternum, but are afterwards vertical. The species Dr. L. named Emys 

 hemispherica. 



Mr. Isaac Lea, referring to his late communication to the Academy 

 on the subject of fossil bones in the collection from the new red sand- 

 stone, stated that since then he had received the Proceedings of the 

 Boston Natural History Society, which contained a paper by Mr. 

 Welles, read in December last, noticing the fact that fossil bones of 

 laru^e vertebrate animals had been found in two instances in the red 

 sandstone of Connecticut valley. Mr. Lea said that this was the first 

 notice he had met with of the discovery of bones of this character in 

 this forination. 



Dr. Morton offered some remarks on the infrequency of mixed off- 

 spring between the European and Australian races. 



The singular paucity of half-caste or mulatto children in New Holland, has 

 been remarked ever since that country was first colonized by Europeans. Of 




174. 



[AruiL, 



the fact there can no longer be a question ; it has even led to official inquiries on 

 the part of the Colonial Government, and is yet regarded as a physioIo;:ical paradox. 

 Among many o^her questions which the Legislative Council of Sydney has 

 addressed to the colonial magistrates, was the following one : " Are there any, 

 and how many, half-castes in your district?" The official replies of thirty-one 

 of these magistrates are published in detail in the " Minutes of Evidence " issued 

 by th Legislature at Sydney, in October, 1845.* From these Reports I have 

 drawn up the following Table, in which is given the name of each colony or 

 settlement, the whole number of aborigines inhabiting its precincts, the number 

 of half-breeds living with the natives, and the number also of half-breeds who 

 remain with the white population. ' '. 



* For these very interesting documents [ am indebted lo the kindness of Dr. Charles Nichol- 

 mon, a highly intelligent Member of the Legislative Council. 



t The magistrate testifies that there are " very few children " in his District, and that the 

 majority of tliem are half-caste. 



I This number, " one fifth," evidently alludes to the children, though it is vaguely expressed. 



^" Several have been bom, but I know of none living." 



U " Very few. I have only seen two." 




ISol.] 175 



Now we have here the extraordinary fact, that while the native population in 

 the thirty-one districts is represented to be nearly 15,000, the whole number of 

 half-castes or mulattoes does not exceed 200. 



The causes of this singular disparity have been variously surmised. Infanti- 

 cide at birth is one of them ; but this can have but a partial effect, for we find 

 that fully one-half of the mixed race is living with the natives. Syphilis is also 

 adduced, but its influence is manifestly very restricted. Promisaions inter- 

 conrse is certainly a check upon fecundity ; but why should its influence be more 

 manifest in Australia than elsewhere ? and as to repugnance between the races, 

 this has been set aside by local circumstances. These and various other con- 

 siderations have been cited in explanation, but without satisfying the inquirer ; 

 and we may therefore ask, is not the real cause the difference of race, the dis- 

 parity of primordial organization ? 



Perhaps no two human races are more remote from each other than the Eu- 

 ropean and Australian ; and where such extremes are blended, reason and analogy 

 lead u? fo expect only a limited fertility. In connection with, and explanatory 

 of, this phenomenon, Count Strzelecki, a distinguished Polish traveller, has 

 stated the following proposition, which I give nearly in his own terms: When- 

 ever a female of an aboriginal or barbarous tribe, has conceived by a European, 

 she loses the power of conception on a renewal of intercourse with a male of her 

 own race, retaining that only of procreating with a white man. "Hundreds of 

 instances of this extraordinary fact," observes Count Strzelecki, "are on record 

 in the writer's memoranda, to prove that the sterility of the female being relative 

 only to one, and not to another male, is not accidental, but follows laws as cogent, 

 though as mysterious, as the rest of those connected with generation." New 

 South Wales and Van Diemen''s La7id, p. 34G. 



My object on the present occasion is merely to state the apparent facts of the 

 case, in order to draw the attention of physiologists, and observers in general, to 

 a more careful and extended notice of these remarkable phenomena.

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



The Committee to which was referred Mr. Cassin's paper read at

Notes of an examination of the Birds composing the family Caprimnlgidce., in 

 the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of rhiladelphia. 



By John Cassin. 



1 . Caprim. u Igidm . 



No family of birds presents an aspect more uninviting, nor perhaps greater 

 real difliculties in its investigation, nor has any one been more generally neglec- 

 ted, than this. The great fathers of modern Zoology have been but rarely con- 

 sulted respecting their knowledge of Caprimulgus. 



The notes I am now about to offer, I have only to say, are the results of much 

 labor and of as careful research as I am capable of making, with the assistance and 




1 76 [April, 



confirmation too, of gentlemen of this Academy in whose judgment and accura- 

 cy I have the most entire confidence. It is tiue, however, that they have been 

 written, and the material accumulated during my but limited leisure, or at such 

 fragments of time as I can spare from a business requiring constant attention, (and 

 between which and myself I find it difficult always to maintain the ivtente, cordiale,) 

 from which fact, I am fully aware, there may have arisen oversights or misap- 

 prehensions from want of more extended or more systematic study. I hope, how- 

 ever, that few such will be found, and at all events I shall have the gratification 

 of being one of the first to invite attention to a hitherto much neglected field for 

 investigation, and perhaps to induce others to enter upon the general examination 

 of the many species of birds, the names of which alone are known, and the 

 descriptions of which continue to be copied by succeeding authors from their 

 predecessors. 



2. Caprimidgns, Linn. 



This genus appears to be restricted to the old world. I have never seen a true 

 Caprimulgus from any part of America or the American islands. 1 propose to 

 notice in the course of this paper all the American genera, of which I will give 

 a list of such species as I have seen. 



3. Hydropsalis. Wagler, Isis, XXV. p. 1222. (1832.) 



Original description. "Character universalis Caprimulgi ; cauda profunde 

 furcata, rectrice utrinque extima elongatissima." 



Added by me. Bill rather long, (longer than typical Caprimulgus) slender, 

 and compressed toward the tip, with about 8 or 10 pairs of bristles, which are 

 longer than the bill and curved at the ends, gape moderate, nostrils medial, 

 somewhat elevated. 



Wings long, first and second primaries generally longest, second and third 

 strongly sinuated on their outer webs, three first primaries serrated on their outer 

 edges, shafts of primaries very strong. 



Tail usually with the two external feathers much longer than the others, 

 sometimes graduated with the two middle feathers shortest, sometimes with the 

 two middle feathers lengthened and next in length to the external. 



Tarsi covered with scales and slightly feathered below the joint. Wings 

 without the white bar on the primaries which is found in typical Caprimulgus, 

 tail more or less marked longitudinally with white. 



Ohs. A very natural genus, first described by Wagler as above in 1832, and 

 afterwards called Psalurus by Swainson in Cab. Cy. Birds, ii. p. 339 (1837.) It 

 appears to be exclusively American. 



The species of this genus which I haive seen are: 



1. Hydropsalis torquatiis, (Gm.) Caprimulgus furcifer, Vieill. C. psalu- 

 rus, Temm. 



2. Hydropsalis limbatus, Cassin (Oct. 1849.) H. ereagra, Bonap. (1850.) 



3. Hydropsalis segmeutatus, Cassin (Oct. 1849.) 



4. Hydropsalis lyra, Bonap. (1850.) 



4. Hydropsalis torquatus, (Gm.) 



1. Caprimulgus torquatus, Gm. Syst. Nat. ii. p. 1032, (17&8j) a name given 

 by Gmelin on the faith of the "Gold-collared Goatsucker" of Latham, Gen. 




1851.] 177 



Syn. ii., pt. 2, p. 601, (1783,) who copies from Briss. Orn. ii, p. 481, (1760,) 

 the latter giving the name of Caprimidgus Brasiliensis on the faith of, and 

 copying the description of the Guira querea Basiliensibus of Marcgrave and Piso 

 in Historia Naturalis Brasiliae, p. 202, (Amsterdam 1648.) 



2. Caprimidgus furcifer, Vieill. Nouv.Dict., x. p. 242, (1817,) a name given 

 by Vieiilot on the faith of "Del cola de tixera" of Azara, Apunt. Hist. Nat. 

 del Paraguay, ii. p. .536, (Madrid 1805.) 



3. In copying Azara's description of the tail of this bird, Vieiilot makes an 

 important mistake in substituting the French " plus " for the Spanish " menos." 



4. Caprimidgus psahtrus, Temm. PI. col. ii. p., pi. 157, 158, (27 liv.) 



5. The above names are probably synonymes. 



6. Caprimidgus matiurus, Vieill. Nouv. Diet. X. p. 239, (1817)? 



The name, Caprimidgus brasiliensis, was given by Brisson to the bird de- 

 scribed by Marcgrave and Piso, as above, and he copies their description with 

 some alteration. He says of the tail " Rectrices autem binae intermediae laterali- 

 bus multo sunt longioribus." 



The expression used by Marcgi^ve and Piso is, " Cauda octo digitos longa, 

 constans in extremitate duabus pennis longioribus reliquis." 



In the tail of the common species known as Caprimidgus psalurus, Temm., the 

 two outer feathers are much the longest of all, and the two middle feathers are 

 next in length, presenting a very unusual form. 



Gmelin in his description (or rather definition) of C. torguatus, cites G. bra- 

 siliensis Briss. as a synonyme, also " Guira querea, Ray and Willoughby " and 

 *' Gold-collnred Goatsucker, Lath." and copies Brisson's description of the tail of 

 this bird, which Latham had also done, but having seen the original description 

 the latter adds, " The two middle tail feathers are eight inches in length." 



The entire description by Marcgrave and Piso is copied almost verbatim by 

 Willoughby, Ornithologia p. 71, (Folio, 1676). That of the tail is exactly the same 

 word for word, " Cauda octo digitos longa constans in extremitate duabus pennis 

 longioribus reliquis." 



In Ray's edition, in English, of " the Ornithology of Francis Willoughby," p. 

 108, (Folio, 1678,) he translates the Latin of Marcgrave and Willoughby thus : 

 'Tail eight inches long, having in the outsides two feathers longer than the 

 rest." 



The term used by Marcgrave " in extremitate" is so equivocal, it is not 

 surprising that Brisson was perplexed, and to have fully justified Ray's 

 English, it would have looked better in the plural. Ray's translation is, however, 

 quite as warrantable as any other, and with the description otherwise answers 

 sufficiently well for the Caprimulgus psalurus, Temm. PI. col. 157. I am ac- 

 quainted with no other American species to which can.be applied the following 

 from Marcgrave : " circum totum collum autem pone caput annulum habet, ob- 

 scure aureum." The size given by Marcgrave is not very definite : " Alaudae 

 ma^nitudine est, sed quia longas alas et caudam habet multo longiorem, videtur 

 major." This phrase is copied by the subsequent writers above mentioned, in 

 the course of the observations of whom nothing occurs from which lean infer 

 that either of them had seen the species. 



Upon comparing a specimen of C. psalurus with either Alauda arvensis or 

 cristata it will be found that the comparison made use of by Marcgrave may be 



24 




178 [April, 



applied to this bird without such an extended exercise of the imagination as might 

 at first appear necessary, throwing out of the case too his " videtur major." His 

 only other dimensions are " digiti fere longitudine," applied to the bristles, 

 " rostri superioris ad latera," and "Alas longas habet nimirum semipedem," 

 both of which answer quite well for the bird we now suppose them to have 

 been applied to, and so does his description in all other respects. 



I beg to remind the reader, however, that I have no disposition whatever to 

 attempt to make out a case, ex parte, and therefore suggest the possibility of 

 Marcsrave and perhaps Brisson having had in view an African species, the Capri- 

 mulgus climacurus, Vieill. Gal. des Ois. i. pi. 122, which will suit their descrip- 

 tions to some extent. Probably at the time Marcgrave wrote (1648) and certain- 

 ly in the time of Brisson, (1760) bird skins from Africa were often taken to Bra- 

 zil by vessels engaged in the slave trade, and errors respecting locality might 

 have occurred readily. 



The tail of this bird has been particularly unfortunate. In the description by 

 Azara, in " Apuntamientos para la historia natural de los Paxaros del Paraguay," ii. 

 p. -537, (octavo, Madrid, 1805,) he gives the dimensions of the tail of his " Del 

 cola de tixera " thus: "cola 10 plumas : la de afuera 6 primeia 24 lineas mas 

 larga que la segunda: esta 5 mas que la tercera: y esta 2 mas que la quarta, y 

 11 menos que la central." 



In the French edition of Azara, (Walckenaer's) iv. p. 115, (octavo, Paris, 

 1809) these dimensions are given correctly: " Des 10 (pennes) de la queue, I'ex- 

 terieure a 24 lignes de plus que la deuxieme, celle-ci 5 de plus que la troisieme, 

 et cette derniere 2 de phis que la quatrieme, et 11 de mains que !es 2 du 

 milieu." 



But Vieillot in Nouv. Diet. x. p. 242, in his description of Caprimulgns furci- 

 fer, which is copied from Azara almost verbatim, alters one most important word 

 in the dimensions as given above ; he says, " Cette queue a la penne exterieure 

 de vingt-quatre lignes plus longue que la deuxieme, celie-ci en a cinq de plus que 

 la troisieme, et cette derniere deux de plus que la quatrieme, et onze de plus que 

 les deux du milieu." 



This error has, of course, caused some confusion, and Vieillot's description con- 

 taining it appears to have been relied on by some authors, (including Bonaparte 

 in Consp. Av.) 



This tail was a standing riddle to Vieillot. In Ency. Meth. ii. p. 543, 

 (quarto, Paris, 1823) although he continues to copy the description of Azara, 

 he further alters, thus: "Cette queue a sa penne exterieure plus longue 

 de vingt-quatre lignes que la deuxieme; celle-ci en a cinq de plus que la 

 troisieme, qui en a deux de plus que la quatrieme, yici surpass^ les deiix du 

 milieu de jires d'un police." 



All the dimensions of Azara answer very well for the Caprimulgus psalurus, 

 Temm., in young plumage or perhaps in the plumage of winter, which was the 

 season when the observations of Azara were made, " He visto," he says, "algu- 

 nos siempre solos, y en lo mas crudo del invierno nunca en verano ni prima- 

 vera." 



The synonymes of this species given by Hartlaub, in Systematischer Index zu 

 Don Felix de Azara's Apuntamientos, &c., p. 19, (quarto pamphlet, Bremen, 

 J 847,) are entirely correct as far as they go. 



The fact that a specimen in the British Museum is named Caprimulgus manurus 




1851.] 179 



Vieill., and inserted in the catalogue (p. 10) as distinct, only prevents me from 

 giving that nanrie also, as a synonyme for the present species. I do not see hovir 

 the species can be made out from Vieillot's description in either Nouv. Diet, x, p. 

 239, (1817) or Ency. Meth. ii. p. 540, (1823) which both contain important 

 errors. In the original description (Nouv. Diet.) he says, "Nous verrons par la 

 suite un engoulevent dont la troisieme penne de la queue est la pins longue de 

 tallies ; singularite tjui ne se rencontre chezaucun autre oiseau. Celle du Manure 

 se presente sous une forme plus extraordinaire; la premiere penne caudale de 

 chaque cote est tres longue et depasse les deux intermediares d'environ cinq 

 pouces ; les troisieme et quatrieme sont tre,i coiirte, et la cinquieme, qui a plus de 

 longeur qui celles-ci, est plus courtes que les deux du milieu qui ont plusieurs 

 pouces de moins que les deux premieres." 



The third feather of the tail is twice mentioned and contradictorily represented, 

 the second feather is not described at all, and the fifth is said to be shorter than 

 the two in the middle, which must be considered as making twelve tail feathers, 

 when really Hydropsalis and other American ^aprimulgi have not more than 

 ten. In Ency. Meth. the observation "Nous verrons," &c., is omitted. 

 He proceeds, however, with exactly the same description, vi'hich even without 

 the introductory representation that the third feather is longest of all is not intelli- 

 gible, because the fifth is still represented as "plus courte que celles du milieu." 

 There are mistakes here, now difficult to correct, but as the descriptions in both 

 books are otherwise quite like the species now before us, I have little doubt that 

 it is the bird meant by this distinguished and learned naturalist. 



5. Genus Stenopsis, nobis, nov. gen. 



Bill longer than typical Caprimulgus, tapering and depressed ; upper mandi- 

 ble with about six or seven pairs of bristles, which are very rigid at their bases, 

 but very slender and curved at their tips ; gape very moderate, nostrils medial ; 

 aperture somewhat elevated. 



Wings moderate, second and third primaries longest (usually the second) and 

 sinuated on their outer webs. Tail ample, Jan-shaped, truncate or slightly 

 emarginate. Tarsi slightly feathered below the joint, shorter than the middle toe 

 and claw, and covered with scales. 



Wings with a conspicuous white bar in males, and probably in females; neck 

 with a broad and uninterrupted collar, white in front, and fulvous behind; tail 

 usually with a large portion of white on the external feathers ; characters of the 

 bill resembling Hydropsalis, Wagler. 



Obs. Another exclusively American genus, the bill in which very considerably 

 resembles that of Hydropsalis. The species which I have seen are : 



1. Stenopsis cayennensis, (Gm.) PI. Enl. 760. Jard. and Sel., III. pi. 87. 



2. Stenopsis longirostris, (Bonap.) Jour. Acad., Philada., iv. p. 384. 



3. Stenopsis parvulus, (Gould.) Pfoc. Zool. Soc, London, 1837, p. 22. 

 Which have several synonymes. 



6. Ge7ius Nyctidromus. Gould, Icones Avium, part ii. (August 1838.) 

 The species which I have seen of this genus are : 



1. Nyctidromus americaniis, (Linn,) Caprimulgus albicollis, Gm. Nyeli- 

 dromtis Derhyanus, Gould. 



2. Nyctidromiu gidanensis, (Gm.) 



3. Nyctidromus grallarius, Bonap. 




180 [April, 



7. Nyctidronms aviericanus, Linn. 



1. Caprimtdgus americanus, Linn. Syst. Nat., i. p. 340, (1766,) a name 

 givtn by Linnaeus on the faith of Capnmitlgas sea Noctna sylvatlra Jamaycen- 

 sis minor, described by Ray, Syn. Av. et Pis. Appendix, p. 180, (1713,) who 

 copies his description from the manuscripts of Sir Hans Sloane, which were 

 afterwards published in Nat. Hist. Jamaica ii. p. 296, (1725,) with a figure, 

 pi. 255. fig. 1. 



2. Caprimulgus albicollis, Gm. Syst. Nat. ii. p. 1030, (1788) a name given by 

 Gmelin on the faith of the White-throated Goatsucker of Latham, Gen. Syn. ii pt. 

 2 p. 596. 



3. Nyctidromus Derhyanus, Gould Icon. A v. part ii. p. pi. (August 1838.) 



4. These names are probably synonymes, and the original describers from 

 specimens are Sloane for C. americanus, Latham for C.albicollis and Gould for 

 N. Derbyanus, to which Azara may be added, (Del Ybiyau, Apunt. ii. p. 538, 

 1805.) 



The Caprimulgus americanus of Linnaeus appears to have been founded on the 

 faith principally of Ray's description, and on Sloane's description and figure. Lin- 

 naeus enumerates two species only of Caprimulgus ; the first of which (C euro- 

 ^,) he briefly characterizes as "C. narium tubis obsoletis," and the second 

 (C ameriean7cs,) as " C. narium tubulis eminentibus." He cites as synonymes 

 the description and figure of Sloane, and the description by Ray, as above, also 

 " Caprimulgus jamaicensis, Briss. Av. ii. p. 480," and " Hirundo major subfusca 

 miscella, macula alba sphoerica in utraque alba. Brown, Jam. p. 467." 



In Brown's Jamaica p. 467, (Civil and Natural History of Jamaica by Patrick 

 Brown, M. D. London 1756,) there is a short and entirely inconclusive description 

 the most important feature in which is, that the bird is " about the size of a 

 Sparrow Hawk, and of a darkish, mottled and striped colour." He gives as 

 synonymes " Catesby i. pi. 8 " and " The lesser Goatsucker of Edwards, pi. 63," 

 both of which are Caprimulgus vociferus, Wilson. 



Brisson in Orn. ii. p. 480, (1760) under the head of Caprimulgus Jamaicensis^ 

 copies Sloane's description above referred to, and gives several names as synonymes, 

 among them one from Brown different from that given by Linnaeus, that is to 

 say, " Strix capite levi, plumis griseo albidus labiorum pilosus. Brown, Hist, of 

 Jam. p. 473." Upon turning to this I find a bird described as " The screech 

 Owl," with the Latin phrase just quoted, which comprises the entire description. 



The synonymes then, to the point we have now attained are, for much the great- 

 er part, unsatisfactory, nor are Brown's descriptions of any account whatever, so 

 for as relates to actually determining the species. 



Gmelin in his edition of the Syst. Nat. of Linn. ii. p. 1032 (1788,) gives as 

 additional synonymes " Engoulevent a lunettes ou Haleur, Buff. hist. nat. des 

 ois, vi. p. 543," and "American Goatsucker, Lath. syn. ii. 2 p. 600, n. 14," 

 both of which are avowedly founded on Sloane's description and figure. 



Geo. R. Gray, in Genera of Birds gives thisas^a Chorddles, citing Sloane's fig- 

 ure. It is by no possibility a Chordeiles, in which there is no such character as 

 " along the upper mandible were several bristly hairs in line,'' as stated by 

 Sloane and represented in his plate. 



Gosse in Birds of Jamaica p. 51, thinks it may be his Nyctibius pallidns, which 




1851.] 181 



is also impossible for the reason just stated, and others which are obvious upon 

 examination of Sloane's description and figure. 



Bonaparte, in Conspectus Avium p. 63, places Caprimulgus araericanus, Linn, 

 as a Chordeiles. 



It does not appear that either of the authors cited, from Ray to the present time, 

 ever saw a bird which he understood to be the Caprimulgus americanus, Linn., 

 for which Sloane is the sole authority. In fact, the exact expressions used by 

 him are repeated by nearly all writers; for instance, the term "Feuille mort " 

 which he applies to the colour of his bird, is copied exactly by Brisson, Buffon, 

 Vieillot and Latham, while Gmelin latinizes it into " folii marcidi." 



For the purpose then of ascertaining or rendering probable what bird is en- 

 titled to the name of Caprimulgus americanus, hinii., there is nothing left but to 

 revert to the description and figure of Sloane, and to the description in the catalogue 

 of Sloane's birds,'by Ray, who describes "ex ejusdem Schedis manuscriptis," in 

 Syn. Av. App. p. 180. 



A difficulty occurs at once, which has perplexed authors. It is, that although 

 Sloane describes his bird as " seven inches from the end of the bill to that of the 

 tail," he gives a figure about eleven inches long, respecting which Buffon justly 

 enough obs-^rves, "qu'ilest fort rare que I'on donne de pareilles figures grossies." 

 Ray says, " parvaadmodumavis est, septem non plusdigitis longa," having seen 

 the manuscript only. Gmelin, Vieillot, G. R. Gray and Bonaparte appear to rely on 

 the text exclusive of the figure. Brisson says eleven inches long without com- 

 ment, relying on the latter. Buffon (Hist. Nat. des Ois. vi. p. ,'544, 1779) attempts 

 to elucidate, and suggests that the measure given by Sloane may have been taken 

 to the base of the tail only, which he says with the tail (4 inches) would coin- 

 cide with the length of the figure. Latham, perhaps taking the idea from Buffon, 

 offers a similar supposition. But Sloane says very distinctly, "from the end of 

 the bill to that of the tail," and it is clear enough and easily ascertained that all 

 the other birds described and figured by him were so measured. 



It is sufficiently evident to me that Sloane's measurements are simply wrong; 

 he says, " This was seven inches long from the end of the bill to that of the tail, 

 and ten from the end of wing to wing expanded, the tail was four iriches long." 

 It would be difficult to find a bird with such relative dimensions, especially a 

 Caprimulgus. It is simply a mistake made by Sloane himself, as it evidently 

 was so written in his manuscript, according to Ray. Nor are the dimensions 

 given by him ever entirely to be relied on, for the good and sufficient reason that 

 he measured with his thumb, "which," he says, " with a Utile allowance I reck- 

 oned an inch." (Preface to Vol. i. p. 2.) I am disposed to reject his dimensions 

 entirely as given in the description of the species now under consideration, but 

 to place full dependence on those of the figure, because, as he says expressly, his 

 figures were made " on the i)lace." " I employed," says he, " the Reverend Mr. 

 Moore, one of the best designers I could meet with there, to take the figures of 

 them, (fruits,) also of the Fishes, Birds, Insects, &c., in crayons, and carried 

 him with me into several places of the country, that he might take them on the 

 place." The Reverend Mr. Moore no doubt came generally pretty near the 

 right size, but otherwise did not acquit himself very handsomely in birds, judging 

 from the engravings. In plants, however, he did much better. 




182 [April, 



Rejecting then the measurements in the description, it is otnerwise, with 

 the plate, sufficient to determine the genus and perhaps the species. 



The bird belongs to the genus Nyctidromus, Gould, Icon. Av. part ii, and the 

 species is probably N. Derbyanus, Gould, upon which the genus is founded. It 

 is stated in Sloane's description that " it had a quarter of an inch long crooked 

 black bill, with two tubuli about one-eighth part of an inch long for nostrils; 

 along the upper mandible were several bristly hairs in a line the legs and feet 

 were an inch and a half long, covered with brown scales; the toes four, three 

 before, that in the middle three-quarters of an inch long, and one behind." 

 " The head and back," he says, " were covered with feathers of a mixt color of 

 feuille niort, grey and black, the wings and tail were of the same color, only 

 lighter, under the chaps breast and belly, were also of the same. 



All these characters, except the colors, are represented in the plate. 



They are all, including the colors, to be found in the genus Nyctidromus, and 

 there only. Tubular or elevated nares, "Nares sub-basales elevatae" (Gould) 

 are characteristic. It is the only American genus with legs entirely bare, except 

 one species of Podager, and there is no species of any American genus at all, to 

 the color of which the term " feuille mort " can be applied with as great pro- 

 priety as to those of this. 



The entire description, so far as relates to color, applies to all the species of the 

 genus Nyctidromus, of which there are three. They are so much alike that they 

 can scarcely be said to differ in any other respect than size. The largest of these 

 species which is about the size of Sloane's figure, I am disposed to conclude is the 

 Caprimulgus americanus, Linn., and that it is the same as the Nyctidromus Der- 

 byanus, Gould, a common South American bird. 



It is important that it should be mentioned, however, that this bird has not been 

 observed in Jamaica by Mr. Gosse, or by any other writer so far as my know- 

 ledge extends. Should future investigations elicit the fact that it does inhabit 

 that island I shall consider the matter settled beyond a doubt. That a species of 

 Nyctidromus does inhabit Jamaica, and which is not mentioned by Mr. Gosse, 

 Sloane's figure and description clearly demonstrate. 



Caprimulgus albicollis, Gm., is the white throated Goatsucker of Latham 

 described by him from a specimen " in the collection of Major Davies, supposed 

 to have come from Cayenne." The description is accurate, except that the size 

 is rather small, " length ten inches and a quarter," but of course taken from a 

 skin. In Gen. Hist. vii. p. 359, he (Latham) gives the length twelve inches, and 

 an excellent description under the same name, and justly cites " L'Ibiyan, 

 Voyage d'Azara iv. No. 310" as a synonyme. This citation is of the French 

 edition of Azara, with notes by Cuvier and Sonnini, Paris, 1809. (Walckenaer's 

 edition.) The description by Azara is the best extant. Gould's figure in Icon. 

 Av. is incomparable. 



The bird now under consideration is the Caprimulgus albicollis, Gm., of the 

 greater number of the European authors; occasionally, however, this name is 

 applied to the bird which is properly Caprimulgus guianensis, Gm., as by De 

 Wied, Beitr. iii., p. 318. 



It also appears to be the Caprimulgus laticaudus. Drapiez. Diet. Class. d'Hist. 

 Nat. vi. p. 169. (Paris, 1824, octavo.) 




1851. J 



183 



8. Nyetidromus gnia7i7tsis. (Gm.) 



Gmelin gives this name on the faith of the "Guiana Goatsucker" of Latham, 

 Gen. Syn. ii. pt. 11 p. 598, and " Le Montvoyau de la Guyana" of Buffon, Hist. 

 Nat. des Ois. vi. p. 549, figured in PI. Enl. 733 (which represents a young bird.) 



It is very similar to the preceding, but differs in size. 



The Prince de W ied, in Beit, zur Nat. von Bras. iii. p. 318, gives the most satis- 

 factory description extant of this bird. He says, hovi^ever, that it is the female 

 of C. albicollis, which name he cites accordingly as a synonyme. He is high 

 authority on the birds of Brazil, but as I am not aware that so great a difference 

 in the size of the sexes occurs in this difficult group, I have preferred, at present, 

 retaining it as a distinct species. 



9. Nyctidrormis grallaritis . (Bonaparte.) 



This appears to be a third species, of which there are several specimens in 

 the collection of this Academy. Bonaparte's description is not, however, suffi- 

 ciently explicit, and may possibly be intended for something else. 



10. Gemis Antrostomiis, " Gould." Bonap. Comp. List, p. 8. G. R. Gray, 

 List Gen., p. 9, " Gould, Icon. Av., 1838." Agassiz Nomen. Zool. Aves. 

 p. 6, " Gould" Nuttall Man. Orn. i. p. 739, (1840.) 



Obs I have not found the original description of this genus by Gould. It is not 

 contained in the copy o{ Icones Avium in the library of this Academy, and I sus- 

 pect that the only description is that by Nuttall in Man. Orn. 1 p. 739, (1840.) 

 I have seen the following species : 



1. Antroslomus carolinensis. (Gm.) And. B. of .Am. pi. 52. 



2. Antrostomiis rufns. (Gm.) Buff. PI. Enl. 735. 



3. Antrostomus serico-caudatns . Cassin, Jour. Acad. Philadelphia ii. pi. 12 

 (Quarto.) 



4. Antrostomus voclferus. (Wilson.) Am. Orn, v. p. 71, pi. 41. 



5. Antrostomus macro-mystax, Wagler, Isis 1S31, p. 533 (a species?) 



6. Antrostomus ocellatus. (Tschudi.) Fauna Peruana Aves. pi. 5, fig. 2. 



7. Ajitrogtomus Nuttallli. (And.) B. of Am. (Octavo) vii. p. 350 pi. 495. 

 The two latter species vary from the typical characters, and may be entitled to 



constitute a distinct genus. I have seen also one other small species, of which a 

 young specimen is in the collection of the Academy, and, is labelled as being 

 from Cayenne. I cannot identify it. 



11. Antrostovius carolinensis. (Gm.) 



In the genus Antrostomus, and in this species particularly, the bristles which 

 have their origin in the upper mandible reach their maximum. They exist how- 

 ever in greater or lesser degree of developement in all typical Caprimulgidm. 



In the present species these bristles are not only long and rigid, but each one 

 is ciliated, or, as Audubon expresses it," with lateral filaments." It is the only 

 species in which I have observed such formation. 



12. Antrostomtis rufus, (Gm.) 



This bird, named by Gmelin, (Syst. Nat. ii. p. 1030) on the faith of the descrip- 

 tion by Latham of " the rufous Goatsucker" (Gen. Syn. ii. pt. 2, p. 597) who 

 copies from Buffon's " Engouleverit roux de Cayenne" (Hist. Nat. des Ois. vi. p. 

 545) is another of the species which have been lost sight of. 




184. [April, 



A specimen in the Rivoli collection appears to he this bird. Though much 

 resembling A. caroline7isis, in colors and general appearance, it is smaller, the 

 wings are shorter and the bristles along the bill are simple, not ciliated as in 

 that species, and are, as BufFon says, " tres roides." I may observe, by the way, 

 that although this author expressly describes his bird as having the bill bordered 

 by nine or ten pairs of very stiff " moustaches," he omits them in his plate. 

 (PI. Enl, 735.) 



The specimen alluded to does not accurately agree with Buffon's figure; the 

 bill is longer, and the lateral tail feathers are largely tipped with white, the neck 

 has, moreover, a whitish collar. I suspect that the A. rufus is a South Ameri- 

 can species nearly allied to A. ca-rolinensis. 



13. Antrostomus macromystax. (Wagler.) Isis 1831, p. 533. 



I have attached this name to two specimens from California which are very 

 nearly related to A. vociferus, (Wilson.) They seem to be the bird meant in the 

 description or rather notice by Wagler, as above. 



14. Genus Nyctibius. VieiUot, Analyse, p. 38. 



Obs. This genus is one of the most easily recognized in the circle of the 

 Caprimulgidae, and is another which is exclusively American. 1 have seen the 

 following species : 



1. Nyctibius grandis. (Gm.) Gray's Gen. pi. 16. 



2. Nyctibius izthereus. (De Wied.) Reise, Bras, i, p. 236. 



3. Nyctibius longicmidatus. (Spix.) Av. Bras, ii, pi. 1. 



4. Nyctibius jamaicencis. (Gm.) Gosse, 111. B. of Jam. pi. 6. 



5. Nyctibius leucopterus. (De Wied.) Des Murs, Icon. Orn. pi. 49, 50. 



6. Nyctibius bracteatus. Gould. Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond. 1816, p. 1. 



15. Nyctibius grandis. (Gm.) 



The Wood Owle of Sloane (Nat. Hist. Jamaica ii. p. 295) and the Guira querea 

 of Butfon (Hist. Nat. des Ois. vi. p. 570, Quarto, 1783) appear to be this species. 

 I am not acquainted with any other American species which has the jaws three 

 inches in width, as stated by both the authors cited, nor to which their descrip- 

 tions in other respects can be more properly applied. 



Latham (Gen. Syn. ii. pt. 2, p. 591) gives both those names as synonymes 

 for his " Jamaica Goatsucker," of which he gives a description and figure, upon 

 transferring which to his edition of the Systema Naturae, Gmelin gives the name 

 Caprimulgus jamaicensis, (Syst. Nat. ii. p. 1029,) and also erroneously cites as 

 synonymes the same names as Latham. The figure given by Latham (Gen. Syn. 

 ii. pt. 2, pi. 57) represents the N. jamaicensis, which is a well known species, 

 and that plate seems to have saved Gmelin's name from being a synonyme of the 

 N. grandis, there being little in the description which may not be applied to the 

 latter, except the size. 



16. Nyctibius atkereus, (De Wied.) 



1. Caprimulgus cBthereus described by De Wied in Reise nach Brasilien i. p. 

 236, (1820.) 



2. Caprimvlgus longicaudatus described by Spix in Av. Bras. ii. p. 1, (1825.) 




1851.] 185 



3. De Wied in Beitrage zur Nat. von Bras, iii, p. 303, 310, (1830,) expresses 

 his conviction that these two names are synonymes, and they are so regarded by 

 Gray in Cat. Fissi. Brit. Mus., p. 5, by Bonaparte in Cons. Av., p. 58, and by 

 others. 



4. They are distinct species. 



That very excellent naturalist, Maximilian, Prince de Wied, appears to have 

 been the first to notice this fine species, vs^hich he named as above. He appears, 

 however, not to have seen Spix's specimens, but to have arrived at the conclusion 

 that C. longicaiidatus is the same as his C. xthereiis, irom the figure and de- 

 scription given in Av. Bras. 



Notwithstanding such high authority, I feel myself compelled to decide from 

 specimens in the collection of this Academy, that these are two species. N. mthe- 

 reus is much the larger bird, being about the size of iV. gravdia. It measures in 

 total length fully 22 inches, as stated in De Wied's description; iV. longicaudatus 

 measures only 18 inches, and is in all other respects smaller, though with a com- 

 paratively longer tail. The colors of the plumage in both species present con- 

 siderable similarity, though in N. sthereus they are darker, and the longitudinal 

 stripes much more strongly defined. They are so much unlike that no person 

 would consider them the same who saw them together. 



All the species of this genus which I have seen have more or less prominent, 

 erect, earlike feathers above the eye. These are quite obvious in N. atherens. 

 Two specimens of iV. athereus and one of N. longicaudatus are in the collection. 

 I have seen another specimen of the former in the collection of the United States 

 Exploring Expedition (Vincennes and Peacock) at Washington, which is labelled 

 "Nyctibius grandis," and so called in Mammalia and Ornithology of U. S. Ex- 

 ploring Expedition by T. R. Peale, p. 327, of course erroneously. 



(In the publication here alluded to, of which there are thirty copies only in 

 the United States, but one in Pennsylvania and none in the city of Philadelphia, 

 the general history of, and description of supposed new species of Caprimulgidae, 

 and, in fact, of all the Fissirostres, are erroneous to an extraordinary extent. I 

 have only so far carefully examined it, but have sufficient knowledge of the book 

 to be fully satisfied that little confidence can be placed in any of Mr. Peale's 

 birds, described as new, of which there are upwards of a hundred.) 



17. Nyctilius jamaicensis, (Gm.) 



1. Cajjrirmdgus jamaicensis, Gm. Sj'st. Nat. ii. p. 1029, (1788,) a name 

 given by Gmelin on the faith of the " Jamaica Goatsucker" described by Latham, 

 Gen. Syn. ii. pt. 2, p. 591, (1783.) 



2. Caprinndgus griseus. Gm. Syst. Nat. ii. p. 1029, (1788,) a name given 

 by Gmelin on the faith of the " grey Goatsucker " of Latham, Gen. Syn. ii. pt. 2, 

 p. 592, (1783,) which is derived from the " Engoulevent gris " of Buffon, Hist. 

 Nat. des Ois vi. p. 548, (1779.) 



3. Caprimnlgns cornutus. Vieill. Nouv. Diet. x. p. 245, (1817) a name given 

 by Vieillot to the "Urutau" of Azara, Apunt. Hist. Nat. Paraguay ii. p. 527, 

 (1805.) 



4. These names are probably synonymes, to which may be added Nyctilius 

 nrutati, La Fresnaye, Guer. Mag. 1837, p. 28, and NyctiUics fectoralis, Gouldj 

 Icones Avium, pi. 16, (August, 1838.) 



25 




186 [April, 



No one of six specimens, all of which I consider the JV. jamaieensis as 

 described by Mr. Gosse in his delightful and valuable volume on the l:irds of 

 Jamaica, p. 41, appears to have been so large as indicated by his measurements. 

 There is, however, no reliance whatever to be placed on the measurements of 

 skins, so far as relates to the total lengths, and those of other parts are also lia- 

 ble to error, both from the distortion of the skin in the course of preparation, 

 and from various modes of measuring by naturalists. 



The measurements given by the authors cited above, vary considerably, but 

 their descriptions are, 1 think, sufficiently similar. One specimen in the Rivoli 

 collection (labelled C. Gouldii) is certainly Mr. Gould's N. pectoralls, though it 

 is rather too large for his description, but not large enough for his figure in 

 Icones Avium; the wing, for instance, measuring about 10{ inches, instead of 9 J 

 as in the description, or lOj as in the figure. It appears to me to be the bird 

 described by Mr. Gosse, whom I consider the best authority for the species, and, 

 so far as I can see, quite justified in quoting N. pectoralis, Gould, as z synonyme. 

 Gosse's and Gmelin's descriptions are sufficiently similar, that of the latter is, 

 however, copied from Latham. 



To this bird in very nearly the same plumage as figured by Mr. Gould, the 

 observations by La Fresnaye on N. urutau seem to apply, which avowedly pro- 

 fesses to be the same as C. cormitus, Vieill. or the urutau of Azara. The des- 

 cription by Vieillot is copied from that of Azara, and corresponds remarkably 

 well with that in Walckenaer's French edition of Azara, iv. p. 112, (Paris 1809.) 



The description by Buffian of the Engouleveut gris. which is C. griseiis, Gm., 

 applies very well so far as it goes to the young bird of this species. There is a 

 specimen in the collection of the Academy not fully grown which is nearly white. 

 This description by Bufibn is the sole foundation for the Caprimulgus griseus 

 Gm., a name which has maintained a place in all systems and compilations to the 

 present time, no bird having ever been found to suit it, to my knowledge. 



18. Scotornis loiigicaudus. (Drapiez.) 



This is the African bird described by Vieillot as Caprimulgus cUmacurus and 

 figured in Gal. des Ois. pi. 122, 1825. It appears to have been first described 

 by Drapiez in Dictionnaire Classique D'Histoire Naturelle vi. p. 169, (Paris 

 1824, Octavo) next by Vieillot, in 1825, and in the same year (1825) again 

 named Caprimulgus longicaudis, by Stephens, Gen. Zool. xiii. p. 89 on the faith 

 of a description and figure by Latham in Gen. Hist. vii. p. 335 pi. 114. The 

 latter calls it " the long tailed Goatsucker." 



19. Genus Chordeiles. Swainson, Faun. Bor. Am. Birds p. 466. 



Obs. Of this genus I have seen the following species, the first three of which 

 have several synonymes : 



1. Chordeiles virginianus. (Briss.) Aud. B. of Am. pi. 147. 



2. Chordeiles brasilianus. ((jfrn.) 



3. Chordeiles acutus. (Gm.) Buff. Pi. Enl. 732. 



4. Chordeiles rupestris, (Spix.) Av. Bras. ii. pi. 2, 



5. Chordeiles tapiti. Bonap. Consp. Av. p. 63. 



There is also in the collection of this Academy a bird which I suppose to be 

 Chordeiles minutus, Bonap. Cons. Av. p. 63. It suits the short description but 




1851.J 187 



indifferently however, and is, as Bonaparte observes, " vix hujus generis," It 

 belongs more properly to m)' genus Lurocalis (Art. 23 of this paper.) 



20. Chordeiles hrasilianus. (Gm.) 



1. Caprimulgus brasilianus. Gm. Syst. Nat. ii, p. 1031, (1788) a name 

 given on the faith of "the Brazilian Goatsucker" of Latham Gen. Syn. ii. pt. 2, 

 p. 598 (1783) who compiled fromBrisson Orn. ii. p. 483 (1760) who copied from 

 Marcgrave and Piso's "Ibijau Brasiliensibus ; Noitibo Lusitanis," Hist. Nat. 

 Bras. p. 195 (1648.) 



2. Caprimulgus noitibo. Vieill. Nouv. Diet. x. p. 241, a name substituted 

 by Vieillot for the above. 



3. Caprimulgus variegalus. "Vieill. Nouv. Diet, x p 238, (1817) a name 

 given on the faith of" Del Jaspeado" of Azara, Apunt. ii. p. 546. (1805.) 



4. < Caprimulgus jaspideus, Merrem." Bonap. Consp Av. p 61. 



" Caprimulgus brasilianus, Lin. Gm. Prinz. Max. Beitr. iii. p. 337," is errone- 

 ously given in Tschudi, Fauna Peruana, Orn. p. 20, as a synonyme for Capri- 

 mulgus ocellatus, Tschudi, Fau. Peru. pi. 5, fig 2, originally described in "Avium 

 conspectus Fau. Per. p. 8 (1844,) and which is certainly the bird described by 

 the Prince de VVied under the name of " C. brasilianus, Linn. Gm. Lath." 



C. oceUatus, Tsch., we regard at present as an aberrant Antrostom^is, and it 

 does not belong to the same genus as the C. brasilianus, Gm., which is a 

 Chordeiles. 



Upon referring to the description given by Marcgrave, as above, which is 

 copied almost verbatim by Willoughby, (Orn. p. 70) and essentially by Brisson, 

 Latham, and Vieillot, characters will be found, I think, sufficient to determine 

 both genus and species, "Caput habet latum et compressum, exterius autem 

 oculos ambit circulus exo albo flavescens. Rostellum minimum habet quod non 

 excedit crassitiem dentis aranei (sorex araneus, Linn ?) nee tam longum est. 

 Nares tamcn patentes in rostro. Caudam habet elegantem,quam in latum potest 

 explicare, duos digitos longam, cum cujus extremitate alae desinunt. Crura alba 

 et secundum corporis molem parvula, vix semidigitum longa." 



Among the American Caprimuldigas the colored ring around the eye, the very 

 small bill, the short tail, and the wings equal to the tail in length, are combined 

 only in the genus Chordeiles. Nothing is said by Marcgrave about the bristles 

 at the base of the bill, but as he particularly mentions them in the description of 

 his only other species, (p. 202,) it is safe to infer that none existed in the present 

 bird, which raises an additional presumption in favor of Chordeiles. 



Let us see what can be made of the specific characters : " Avicula hirundinis 

 magnitudine, pennas in toto corpore inferiore habet ex albis et nigro mixtas ut 

 Niseis, in capite, dorso, alls et cauda nigricante et albido inspersa grata varietate; 

 nonnihil quoque flavedinis albedini admixtum, uno verbo, nigra est et punctulata 

 subtiliter hinc inde." 



This description applies to the bird now before me, which is that described 

 with his usnal great ability by the Prince de VVied as C. semitorquatus. The 

 coloring of the under surface of the body bears a decided resemblance to that of 

 Accipiter nisus, (Linn.) and in all respects I think it is clearly the C. hrasilianus, 

 Gm. 



It will be observed that the color of the tail is represented as similar to that of 




188 I April, 



the upper parts of the body. Neither the white spots near the ends of the tail fea- 

 thers, nor the white collar in front of the neck are mentioned, which I cannot 

 account for, as the latter is not absent in any American Goatsucker. The bird 

 described may have been young, or a female. The expression " caudam ele- 

 gantem" alludes probably more to the form than the color. 



Caprinuilgus oioiiiho., Vieiil., is avowedly a substitute for the name given by 

 Gmelin. Vieillot's description is copied from BufTon, (Hist. Nat. des Ois. vi. p. 

 539, 1789,) who, however, copies from Marcgrave. Caprimulgus variegatus.^ 

 Vieiil., appears to be the same bird. 



The term " Jaspeado" applied to his bird by Azara, appears to mean simply 

 '' marhled" (Connelly and Higgins' Dictionary of the Spanish and English lan- 

 guages ii. p. 232, Quarto, Madrid, 1798,) its latinization into <' jaspideus," 

 which appears to have been done by Merrem, is of very doubtful correctness, 

 and calculated to convey to ears accustomed to the English language, the errone- 

 ous idea that the bird is the color of the stone known as jasper, which would be 

 taken to mean in the generality of cases a reddish brown or liver color; or 

 worse, according to the classic meaning of the word jaspis or jasper, (hence jaspi- 

 deus,) "a stone of a green color," (vide Latin dictionaries.) 



21. Chordeiles acutus, (Gm.) 



Caprimulgus acutus, Gmelin, Syst. Nat. ii. p. I03I. Buff. PI. Enl. 732. 



Caprimulgus pruinosus, Tschudi, Av. Consp. p. 8. Fau. Peru. Aves pi. 6. 



Caprimulgus exilis, Lesson, Rev. Zool. 1839, p. 44. Comp. de Buff. xx. p. 258. 



Chvrdeiies lubeculalus, Jardine, Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist. 1846, p. 118. 



All these names are synonymes. The acumination at the tips of the shafts of 

 the tail feathers, from which the specific name of this bird is derived, affords a 

 character by which it is easily recognized, when present. But this is by 

 no means constantly the case, though when not observable the ends of the shafts 

 of the feathers are frequently abruptly terminated, and appear as if broken off- 

 This fact, and the very indifferent character of Buffon's figure, (PI. Enl. 732,) 

 are sufficient reasons that this bird has not been readily recognized, and that it has 

 been several times described under different names by very able and learned 

 authors. 



Caprirmdgus -pr^dnostis, Tschudi, is this bird. In Fauna Peruana, Cabanis 

 erroneously refers that species to Caprvmidgus semitorquatiis, Gm., having been 

 influenced probably by the Prince de Wied's description of the bird, which he 

 supposed to be the latter, (Beitrage iii. p. 330.) This description applies, however, 

 to Caprimulgus brasilianus, Gm., and not to C. semitorquatus, which belongs to 

 another genus. 



22. Genus Podager, Wagler, Isis xxv. p. 277, (1832.) 

 Proithera, Swainson, Cab. Cy. Birds ii. p. 339, (1837.)

Obs. Each of the distinguished naturalists above cited founds his genus on 

 Caprimulgus duirnus, De Wied, Raise nach Bras, ii, p. 174, (1821,) vfhich appears 

 to be identical with " Del Nacunda" of Azara Apunt. ii. p. 544, on the faith of 

 which Vieillot named the species Cainlmulgus Nacunda, in Nouv. Diet. x. p. 

 240,(1817.) I am acquainted with one species only of this genus, which in- 

 habits South America, and is that upon which it is founded : 



1. Fodager nacunda, (Vieill.) Temm. PI. col. 182. 



23. Genus Lurocalis, noihis, nov. gen. 



Bill depressed, broad at base and suddenly compressed to the point, which is 

 hooked and acute ; nostrils basal, aperture slightly elevated, bristles rudimental 

 or none, mandibles somewhat dilated at base, gape ample. Wings long, pointed, 

 reaching to the end of the tail or beyond ; first and second (usually the second) 

 primaries longest. Tail short, truncate. Tarsi short, feathered in front to the 

 toes, naked behind. General form of head and body broad and robust. Wings 

 and tail without white, throat with a white angular uninterrupted semicollar. 



Obs. Of this new genus I have seen two species, both South American: 



1. Lurocalis Nuttererii, (Temm.,) PI. col. 107. 



2. Lurocalia semitorquatus, (Gm.,) Podager Gouldii, Gray Gen., pi. 18. 



24. Lurocalis semitorquatus, (Gm.) 



1. Cainlmulgus semitorquatus. Gm. Syst. Nat. ii. p. 1031, (1788,) a name 

 given by Gmelin on the faith of the "White collared Goatsucker" of Latham, 

 Gen. Syn. ii.pt. 2, p. 599, (1783,) who copies from " Le' petit Engoulevent 

 tachete de Cayenne" of Buffon Hist. Nat. desOis. vi. p. 540,(1779,) PI. Enl.734. 



2. Podager Gouldii. G. R. Gray, Genera of Birds, pi. 18, figured only, no 

 description published. 



3. These names are probably synonymes. 



In endeavoring to ascertain the genus to which C. semitorquatus, Gm., should 

 be referred, it must be admitted, that if we depend on Buffon's short description, 

 as above, and that of Gmelin, which is shorter, the bird may as readily be con- 

 sidered as belonging to Chordeiles as to any other genus. Buffon, who describes 

 from a specimen ' dans le cabinet de M. Manduyt," which he probably figures 

 also, says that it resembles Mai-cgrave's Ibiyau, (C. brasilianus,) "par la lon- 

 geur relative de ses ailes et par ses autres proportions." In the latter (vide art. 

 20 of this paper) the wings and tail are nearly equal, and this is also the case in 

 Buffon's plate, (PL Enl. 734.) This does not agree with one of the characters of 

 Lurocalis, but in all other respects the bird figured by Buffon has every appear- 

 ance of a bird of this genus, and, moreover, so much resembles the P. Gouldii, 

 that I have little doubt it is the same bird. 



Upon comparing a specimen of the P. Gouldii (which is not a rare bird) with 

 Buffon's plate, the thickness of the head and body, the truncated tail, the general 

 colors of the body above and below, and especially the markings of the wings 

 and tail, present such a strong similarity, that it appears to me impossible to 

 avoid the conclusion that it is the species intended to be represented, notwith- 

 standing the comparative shortness of the wings. 



If we compare with the same plate a specimen of the C. brasilianus, which is 

 referred to it by De Wied, we will quite agree with him that it is " sehr schlecht," 




190 [April, 



(very bad.) Buffon's name, "Engoulevent tachete," is quite appropriate for this 

 species. 



Temminck seems therefore to have been correct (PI. col. vi. p. 78) in apply- 

 ing the name C, semitorqucUus to Buff. PI. Enl. 734. 



25. Lurocalis Nattererii. (Temm.) PI. col. 107. 



This bird is larger than the preceding, and may be distinguished from it 

 not only by its size, but by the greater extent of the rufous color of the lower 

 parts of the body. 



In the present species, not only the ventral region and abdomen are of this 

 color, but it extends upwards almost to the breast. This difference may be seen 

 by comparing PI. col. 107 and PI. Enl. 734. In other respects the two birds 

 present considerable similarity, and may be sexes of the same species. 



26. Genus Steatornis. Humboldt, Obs. de Zool. ii. p. 141. 



I mention the curious bird which constitutes this genus for the purpose of com- 

 pleting the notices inserted in this paper of all the American genera of Caprimul- 

 gidae, and list of all the American species which I have seen. The only known 

 species of this genus, several specimens of which are in the collection of this 

 Academy, is, 



1. Steatornis caripensis. Humb. Nouv. Ann. du Mas. Paris, 1834, p. 321, pi. 15. 



The Chairman presented a statement from the Treasurer, George W. 

 Carpenter, Esq., announcing that he had received from the executors 

 of the late Mrs. Elizabeth Stott of this city, the amount of the legacy 

 bequeathed by her to the Academy, and that the same had been 

 invested by him for the benefit of the Publication fund of the Journal 

 of the Academy, as directed in the will.

May Qth, 1851. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



A letter dated Breslau, Sept. 2, 1850, from the Royal L. C. Academy 

 of Sciences was read, acknowledging the receipt of Proceedings, 

 Vol. 4, No. 8, Vol. 5, Nos. 2 and 3 ; also a second letter from the 

 same, dated Breslau, Dec. 29th, 1850, accompanying Part 2, Vol. 2, of 

 the Nova Acta of that Institution. 



Dr. Leidy read a paper describing new species of Entozoa, &c., en- 

 titled " Contributions to Helminthology 5" which was referred to Dr. 

 Ilallowell, Dr. Rand, and Dr. Bridges. 



Dr. Leidy after some general remarks upon the transplantation of animal tis- 

 sues, stated that about five months ago Dr. Horner removed from a female a 

 scirrhus mamma, a portion of which, at his request, he took home for microscopic 

 examination. In structure it proved to be composed of fibrous tissue and nucle- 

 ated, elongated, or caudated cells. After the examination, about four hours sub- 

 sequent to the removal of the tumor from the woman, Dr. L. inserted four pieces 

 of the tumor, each half an inch long by one-eighth of an inch broad and thick, 

 beneath the integument of the back of a large frog. Three of the fragments were 

 pushed forward to the vicinity of the ear. In a few days succeeding the opera- 

 tion, the incision of the skin perfectly cicatrized. 



Yesterday upon killing the frog, and opening the skin along the back, it was 

 found that three of the scirrhus fragments had formed a vascular attachment with 

 the integument, and for one half their length had had a large development of capil- 

 laries in them. Two of the fragments had also formed a vascular attachment to 

 each other throughout their length. The fourth fragment had formed no attach- 

 ment with the tissues of the frog, and had remained apparently unchanged. 

 Upon examining the fragments with the microscope, it was found that the caudated 

 cells had been entirely transformed into fibrous tissue. 



Dr. L. exhibited a portion of the frog with the fragments of cancer attached. 

 The net-work of blood-vessels pervading the pieces was beautifully distinct to 

 the naked eye. 



May 12th. 

 Vice-President Bridges in the Chair. 



The Librarian announced that the Portrait of Mr. George Ord, which 

 had been presented to the Society by that gentleman at the request of 

 several members, had been received, and was now in the Hall. 



Mr. Vaux read a letter addressed to him by the Rev. Francis Mason, 

 American Missionary at Burmah, dated Maulmain, Feb. 15th, 1851. 



Mr. Mason after observing that he had been " for more than twenty 

 years in this ' sleepy hollow,' shut out from the world and libraries, 

 and with a few exceptions from books," proceeds to make the follow- 

 ing observations of interest, on some plants of Burmah. 



" On looking over Griffith's Medical Botany, which was recently put into my 

 hands, it seems to me that our knowledge is very imperfect in that department

as well as in some others. The plant which produces the Siamese gamboge, for 

 instance, is confessedly unknown. In the southern parts of these Provinces, near 

 the Siamese boundary, there is a tree which produces a species of gamboge that 

 cannot be distinguished from the gamboge that is brought from Siam; and in an ar- 

 ticle which was read before the Asiatic Society of Bengal, three or four years ago, I 

 showe^l that that tree was Garcinia eUlplca, a species named and described as a 

 species imperfectly known by Dr. Wight ; who was not at all aware that it pro- 

 duced gamboge. There can, I think, be little doubt, but that this is the tree which 

 produces the Siamese gamboge. This was so clear to the members of the Asiatic 

 Society, that the Secretary wrote me, ' Our best botanists here, consider that 

 you have hit on the true tree at last.' Again, gum-kino was exported several 

 years ago in considerable quantities from Maulmain, brought overland from the 

 Shan States, and is produced so far as I can ascertain, (vom Sierocarptis Wallichii; 

 yet this tree has no place in our Medical Floras. 



I suspect that a large part of the crude camphor exported from China, and which 

 is always referred to Caviplwra officinanim, is the product of one of the common- 

 est weeds in Eastern India and China. In the early years of my residence at 

 Yavoy, the Burmese pointed out to me a weed with leaves like mullen, which 

 when bruised emits a strong odour of camphor. From it they told me they had 

 been in the habit of distilling, from time immemorial, as good camphor, except 

 that it was not so pure, as that which they saw in my medicine chest. Some of 

 the Chinese settlers also say that the same plant abounds in China, and that cam- 

 phor is made from it there. Mr. O'Riley, a suL'ar manufacturer at Amerst, made 

 more than a hundred pounds of camphor from this weed, a few years ago, and 

 sent a part of it to Calcutta for examination ; and the official authorities reported 

 on his specimens. 'In its refined form, it is identical in all its properties, with 

 Chinese camphor.' Mr. O'Riley sent flowering specimens of the plant to Cal- 

 cutta, and they were forwarded from thence to Dr. Voigt of Serampore, and the 

 report added: ' Dr. Voigt 'states that it belongs to De Candolle's genus Blumea, 

 and is, so far as he can see, a new species.' Not having books to enable me to 

 determine the question of its being a new species or not, I left it in abeyance 

 until I procured De Candolle's Prodromus, three or four years ago, and I was 

 soon satisfied then, that it is the same plant as that which appeared in Wallich's 

 catalogue, as Comjza gvandis, and which De Candolle has described as Blumea 

 grai/dis. Wallich's specimens were from Yavoy, without flowers, and De Can- 

 dolle describes the leaf* as nine inches long with the petiole, by three 

 wide, serrated, and bearing on the petiole five or six remote linear acute lobes ; 

 which corresponds precisely to some specimens of our camphor plant; but it does 

 not correspond to any other species of Blumea in the Provinces. This plant 

 probably covers more of the surface of the Tenasserim Provinces than any other 

 weed. Wherever the trees are cut down to clear the land, it springs up so thick 

 that scarcely any thing else can live with it; so that an old clearing looks in the 

 distance like a field under cultivation." 



A letter was read from the Royal Society of London, dated Feb. 



"Cum petiolo 9 poll, longa, 3 poll, lata serratis, petiolo lobulos, 5 6 dis- 

 tantes lineares acutos gerentibus."

May I6th, 

 Vice-President Wetherill in the Chair. 



Upon taking the chair, Mr. Wetherill announced the decease of the 

 President of the Society, Dr. Samuel George Morton, which took place 

 at his residence in Arch Street yesterday morning, after an illness of 

 only lour days. The present meeting had been convened for the pur- 

 pose of expressing the feelings of the members on this melancholy oc- 

 casion. 



Dr. Bridges in some very appropriate remarks on the character of 

 the deceased, adverted to his long connexion with the institution, al- 

 most from its origin ; his close adherence to its interests under the 

 varied and trying circumstances through which it had passed ; having 

 successively tilled its different offices, he had become the ornament of 

 its prosperity, and died at last its President. 



Dr. Charles D. Meigs expressed his deep and sincere regret for the 

 loss of Dr. Morton, and bore testimony to his great private worth, his 

 eminent scientific and professional abilities, and offered the following 

 Preamble and Resolutions. 



The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia being called upon 

 to deplore the loss of its late respected and beloved President, Dr. 

 Samuel George Morton, and considering that event as of deep interest 

 to the whole Republic of Letters ; feeling that the eminent attainments 

 of their late Chief in the various departments of Literature and Science, 

 entitled him to the respect and admiration of all the friends of learn- 

 ing ; that his consistent course of virtue, his liberality and urbanity, 

 adorned and illustrated the Academy over which he presided, and re- 

 flected honor upon its name, are deeply impressed by the irreparable 

 loss they, in common with all the friends of the Natural Sciences, have 

 sustained by his death: Therefore, 



Resolved, That this Academy esteem the life of their late President 

 to be for all men a shining example of earnest and successful zeal in the 

 pursuit and promotion of learning, in the cultivation of wisdom and 

 virtue, and the practice of the highest liberality and benevolence. 



Resolved, That the Academy do cherish and revere the memory of 

 their deceased illustrious President, and that in order to commemorate 




204< [Mat, 



his name, a marble tablet with a suitable inscription be placed in the 

 Hall of the Academy. 



Resolved, That with heartfelt sympathy we present to his bereaved 

 family, this expression of our admiration of him whose death deprives 

 both them and our common country and the world, of one of the most 

 meritorious of men. 



The Preamble and Resolutions were unanimously adopted. 



Dr. J. C. Fisher offered the following, which was also unanimously 

 adopted. 



Resolved, That a Committee be appointed to select a member to pre- 

 pare a biographical memoir of our late President, Dr. Morton, and that 

 the kindred societies in this city, of which he was a member, be invited 

 to be present when it is read. 



The Committee under this resolution was then appointed as follows; 

 Dr. Jas. C. Fisher, Dr. R. Bridges, Dr. J. K. Mitchell, and Dr. 

 Leidy. 



On motion of Dr. Bridges, the Resolutions were ordered to be pub- 

 lished in four daily papers of this city. 



Dr. Horner offered the following, which was adopted. 



Resolved, That when we adjourn, it shall be to meet in this Hall on 

 Sunday afternoon next, iSth inst., at 3 o'clock, to attend, as a body, 

 the funeral of our late lamented President. 



Dr. Mitchell moved that the Chairman and Secretaries and three 

 other members, be a committee to wait upon the family of Dr. Morton 

 and testify the sympathy of the Society ; which was adopted, and the 

 following members appointed, Dr. Mitchell, Mr. Peterson, and Dr. 

 Horner. 



3Iay 20th. 

 Vice-President Wetherill in the Chair. 



Dr. Leidy remarked that in a recent visit to Dr. Wilson, near Newark, Dela- 

 ware, while rambling in a neighboring wood, upon turning over a log, he discov- 

 ered a mole cricket, (Grillo-talpa America?ia,) standing very quietly at the mouth 

 of a hole. Upon taking it up, the animal exhibited no signs of movement, though 

 perfectly fresh and life-like in appearance. He took it home and next morning 

 examined it, and found it still presenting no signs of life. Every part of the in- 

 sect was perfect, not even the antennas being broken. Upon feeling it., it was 

 very hard and resistant, and on making an incision through the thorax, it exhaled 

 a fungoid odor. The insect had been invaded with a parasitic fungus, which 

 every where filled the animal, occupying the position of all the soft tissues, even 

 into the tarsal joints. It formed a yellowish or cream-colored compact mass, 

 and in the abdomen enclosed in its centre the stomachal teeth of the in- 

 sect. 



Examined microscopically, the fungus matter was found to consist of a myce- 

 lium of filaments for the most part simple, but occasionally branched, and ellipti- 

 cal or globular sporular bodies, averaging the l-2333rd in. in diameter. 




1851.] 205 



Mr. Isaac Lea stated that he had visited within a few days, the 

 locality whence Dr. J. Y. Schelley had procured the reptilian fossil. 

 It was a calcareous conglomerate, the rock being in place and forming 

 a wall on the side of the road, and was not a boulder as had been sup- 

 posed. No further traces of bones had since been discovered. Mr. Lea 

 exhibited a specimen of the rock, and stated that he had now deter- 

 mined to name the fossil C'lepsysaurvs pennsylvanicus, from the pecu- 

 liar form of the vertebra, which resembled an hour glass in shape. 



On leave granted, Mr. Vaux moved that Mr. Pearsall be added to 

 the Committee appointed to select a member to prepare a biographical 

 memoir of the late Dr. Morton. Adopted. 



On motion of Mr. Vaux, it was also resolved that a committee of five 

 be appointed to select a suitable design for a tablet to the memory of 

 Dr. Morton, to be placed in the Hall, and to carry out the resolution 

 relating to this subject, adopted at the meeting of the Society held on 

 the 16th inst. Committee, Mr. Vaux, Dr. Bridges, Mr. Wetherill, Dr. 

 Meigs, Mr. Phillips. On motion of Dr, Leidy, the Curators were 

 added to the Committee. 



May 21th. 

 Vice-President Wetherill in the Chair. 



The Library Committee, to whom was referred the communication 

 from the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, requesting the deposit with 

 them of the Paris Moniteur belonging to the Academy, reported " that 

 as said papers constitute part of a series in connection with the docu- 

 mentary History of the French Revolution, it would be inexpedient to 

 separate them, and they would therefore respectfully decline comply- 

 ing with the request of the Historical Society." Adopted. 



Dr. Fisher, from the Committee on the subject, reported that Dr. 

 Charles D. Meigs had been unanimously chosen by the Committee to 

 prepare a biographical memoir of Dr. Morton, and that Dr. Meigs had 

 accepted the appointment. 



The Committee to whom was referred the following paper by Dr. 

 Leidy, reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings.

 times as large, and possesses membranous appendages. The largest females, with 

 the oviducts distended with eggs of Ascaris entomelas, do not measure over IJ 

 lines. It is also not to be confounded with Angiostoma entomelas, Duj., which, 

 as a generic character, possesses a corneous capsule within the head. 



DisTOMiiM, Retzius. 



3. DisTOMUM LONGUM, M. s. Body whitish, with the blackish ovaries showing 

 through the anterior two-thirds, sub-cylindrical, compressed ; posteriorly sub-lig- 

 ulate, or spatulate, obtusely rounded ; neck cylindrical. Oral acetabulum ob- 

 liquely terminal, urceolate, broader than the neck, 3-5ths of a line in diameter. 

 Ventral acetabulum, a little smaller, and from Ij to two lines behind the former, 

 orbicular, projecting, 5 a line in diameter. Generative aperture just anterior to

 aperture immediately behind the mouth. Ventral acetabulum very small, round, 

 li lines from the mouth. 



Length 1 to 4 lines; breadth of largest anteriorly 1 line, posteriorly li lines ; 

 thickness | of a line. 



Hab. Found frequently, in numbers from 1 to 6 in the lungs of Rana pipiens. 

 Remarks. I was on the point of considering this entozoon as a Monostomum, 

 when I was led to examine it more carefully by the observation of Dujardin,* 

 that it had been described by authors under the name of M. ellipticum, because 

 the ventral acetabulum is very small and difficult to perceive. The latter 1 found 

 without difficulty in the position stated in the description. 



EcHINOKHyNCHUS, Miiller. 



8. EcHiNORHYNCHUs EMYDis, n. s. Body v.nite, cylindrical, slightly narrowed

Hab. Seventeen individuals were obtained from the commencement of the 

 small intestine of Emys geographica. Received from Prof. S. F. Baird. 



Remark. This is, so far as I can ascertain, the first Echinorhynchus whicli 

 has been detected in the Emydae. 



9. EcHiNOKHYNCHUs LATERALIS, n.s. Body cylindroid, Or subfusiform ; poste- 

 riorly narrowed, with an obtusely rounded extremity. Proboscis cylindrical, | of

Vice-President Bridges in the Chair. 



A letter was read from Edward Wilson, Esq., dated Lydstip House, 

 Pembrokeshire, Wales, 15th April, 1851, giving information of a case 

 containing books and specimens of Natural History, which he had for- 

 warded for the Academy. 



Also a letter from the President of the National Society of Agricul- 

 ture, &c., of Lyons, dated 23rd December, 1850, accompanying the 

 donation by that Society, of its Annals for 1849, and '50. 



Mr. Cassin read a communication from Col. Geo. A. McCall, U. S. A., 

 entitled ''Some account of Birds found in Western Texas and New 

 Mexico, with descriptions of new species ;" which was intended for 

 publication in the Proceedings, and referred to the following com- 

 mittee : Mr. Cassin, Dr. Watson and Mr. E. Harris. 



Dr. J. K. Mitchell exhibited a specimen of a fungus growing upon 

 a piece of decayed white-oak wood, which when recent is so luminous 

 as to attract insects to it at night. 



Dr. Leidy remaiked, that, it had occurred to him whilst examining the mole 

 cricket, referred to at the meeting of May 20th, that if the fragments of the 

 insect were placed under favorable conditions, the fungoid matter in the interior 

 of the insect might develope itself into an external form of fungus. He accord- 

 ingl)' placed them in a small glass case, with some moist sphagnum, and allowed 

 them to remain until the present time. Dr. L. exhibited the glass case with the 

 fragments, each having sprouting out of it one, two, or three, elongated, conical 

 stipes of a cream color, from 3 lines to 1 inch long, and from i a line to I2 lines 

 in diameter. Dr. Leidy continued, in examining insects for entophyta and en- 

 tozoa, he had found the hemiptera remarkably free from them, which he con- 

 siders an important fact. Those insects which eat large quantities of vegetable 

 solid food, especially such as eat decaying substances, are very much infected 

 with parasites. The spontaneous generation of entophyta and entozoa finds but 

 few advocates at the present day. Late researches lead us to suspect that many, 

 if not all, entozoa, pass part of their life out of the animals in which they are 

 known as parasites, under forms different from those when within the animals. 



The entrance of the parasites into other animals is effected probably in two 

 ways: with the food of the latter, or by boring from the exterior. The former 

 method is probably the most frequent in aerial animals ; and both methods are 

 frequent in aquatic animals, because, in the latter case, the water affords a good 

 vehicle for the approach of the parasites to any part of the body of the animals 

 to be infected. 



As hemipterous insects suck the juices only of plants or animals, through a 

 delicate proboscis, they are placed under circumstances the most favorable of all 

 animals to avoid taking in with their food, ova, spores, or developed animals and 

 plants of a parasitic character; whilst insects like papulus, crickets, etc., or 

 gulus amongst myriapoda, from their eating decaying substances, swallowing 

 large morsels of such food, are very apt to take in parasites. 



Frequently I have detected adhering to insects and annelida, while living, 

 cryptogamic sporules, which under favorable circumstances, before or after the 




1851.] 



211 



death of the animal, undergo development into the perfect plant. House-flies, 

 and especially earth-wornns, are very liable to the growth of Achlya upon them, 

 and sometimes I have even detected the growth of the latter upon the surface of 

 earth worms still living. 



Mr. Lea stated that during his recent visit to Reading, Penn., he 

 had discovered there a new locality for Zircon, a specimen of which 

 he exhibited, and also a specimen from another unrecorded locality, 

 the Yellow Springs. 



Dr. Burnett, of Boston, made a communication on the subject of his 

 recent microscopic examination of the Cicada septendecim, especially 

 of the alimentary canal and sexual organs, and of the apparatus in the 

 male for producing sound. 



The Librarian announced the donation to the Academy of a portrait 

 of its late President, Dr. Samuel George Morton, which had been exe- 

 cuted under the direction of a committee consisting of Dr. Zantzinger, 

 Mr. J. Cooke, and Mr. J. Lambert, appointed at an informal meeting of 

 the Society, held for that purpose in December 1850. The portrait was 

 painted by Mr. Paul Weber, of Philadelphia County, and is a very 

 faithful likeness. An earlier presentation of the portrait had been un- 

 avoidably prevented. The following members are the donors : Wil- 

 liam Hembel, George W. Carpenter, William S. Vaux, J. H. B. Mc- 

 Clellan, George B. Wood, William S. Zantzinger, John Cooke, Wil- 

 liam Parker Foulke, Jr., Alexander Biddle, E. J. Lewis, Thomas 

 Fisher, Thomas B. Wilson, John S. Phillips, Robert Pearsall, Robert 

 Bridges, A. L. Elwyn, Samuel Ashmead, and J. Price Welherill. 



June loth. 

 Vice-President Bridges in the Chair. 



Letters were read : 



From the Librarian of the British Museum, dated 19th May, 1851, 

 acknowledging the receipt of late Nos. of the Proceedings. 



From the Librarian of the New York State Library, dated Albanyi, 

 June 3rd, 1851, acknowledging the receipt of last No. of the Proceed- 

 ings. 



From Mr. John Hooper, dated New York, June 5th, 1851, accom- 

 panying an additional collection of American Algse, and also referring 

 to a species of Petrel supposed to be new, from the Florida coast ; 

 abdomen white, toes fa.stigiate, v/eb extending nearly to the claws, 

 claws very short and even in length, size much larger than the stormy 

 Petrel. 



From Edward Wilson, Esq., dated Lydstip House, Wales, May 14th, 

 1851, enclosino- bill of lading; and invoice of a case of books intended 

 for the Academy. 



Dr. Horner exhibited a portion of skin affected with the disease called 

 Nigrities, taken from the cheek of a white man : a part originally white 




212 [June, 



which had become black, occasioned by the actual deposit of pigmen- 

 tum nigrum in the rete mucosum. 



June \lth. 



Dr. Leidy read a continuation of his paper entitled *' Contributions 

 to Helminthology ;" which was referred to Drs. Bridges, Ruschenber- 

 ger and Fisher. 



Dr. Leidy stated that he had examined microscopically, the specimen 

 of nigrities which had been exhibited by Prof. Horner at the last meet- 

 ing ; and that it proved to be a true deposit of pigraentum nigrum in 

 rete mucosum. 



A letter was read from the Rec. Sec. of the Penna. State Med. Soc, 

 dated Philadelphia, June 10th, 1851, transmitting a resolution of thanks 

 from that Society for an invitation to visit the Museum of the 

 Academy. 



Dr. Leidy stated he had repeated the experiment of introducing cancerous mat- 

 ter beneath the integument of a frog, which was first announced to the Academy, 

 May 6th. 



The cancerous matter was a fragment of encephaloid, taken from a female after 

 death, by Dr. Henry H. Smith. It was almost as soft as cerebral substance. 

 Beneath the microscope it exhibited a structure of very delicate organic cells, 

 containing numerous granules and one of two nuclei. 



A portion Iths of an inch long, by ith of an inch broad, was inserted under the 

 skin of the back of a frog, on May 8th, 34 hours after its removal from the body 

 of the female. This frog, still living, Dr. L. exhibited to the members, and by 

 an incision through the integument, presented to view the fragment of cancer 

 which had been introduced, and which had not only formed a vascular attachment 

 to the integument, but for one half itself was of a fine red color from the net-work 

 of capillaries which had become developed within it. The fragment had not in- 

 creased in size. A number of its structural cells remained unchanged, but others 

 had broken down into granular masses. 



Dr. L. observed, the experiment not only proved the independent vitality of 

 tissues, which was generally admitted, but also rendered it exceedingly probable 

 that cancer was inoculable, for, as in the experiments, the cancerous fragments 

 continued to live when introduced into cold-blooded animals, they would probably 

 not only continue to live when introduced into warm-blooded animals, but would 

 grow or increase in size. 



Dr. Zantzinger announced to the Society the decease of William 

 Hembel, Esq., which occurred on the 12th inst., at his residence in this 

 city, at the advanced age of 88 years. His long connection with the 

 Institution, his liberality to it on many occasions, his position as its 

 President for nine years, and his scientific and literary acquirements, 

 eminently entitled him to honorable mention on the present occa- 

 sion. 




1850.] 213 







The following Preamble and Resolutions were then offered on the 

 part of Mr. George Ord, and unanimously adopted. 



The Academy deeply sensible of the death of their venerable mem- 

 ber, are impelled by a sense of duty, to give formal expression of their 

 sorrow at the loss of one, who, during the period of twenty-six years, was 

 zealously active in his exertions to advance those branches of know- 

 ledge for the cultivation of which this Institution was created. It is, 

 therefore, 



Resolved, That the Academy, in mourning the departure of a friend 

 whose long life was signalized by his devotion to scientific pursuits, 

 derive consolation from the reflection that their steadfast benefactor 

 was as conspicuous for his efficient benevolence, as for his integrity and 

 social virtues. 



Resolved^ That a copy of the foregoing, be transmitted to the family 

 of the deceased. 



June 24M. 



The Committee to which was referred the communication of Col. 

 McCall on Birds of Mexico, reported in favor of publication in the 

 Proceedings.

Some Remarks on the Habits, ^'c, of Birds met with in Western Texas, between 

 San Antonio and the Rio Grande, and in New Mexico; with descriptions of 

 several species believed to have been hitherto undescribed. 



By Col. Geo. A. McCall, Inspector-General, U. S. Army. 



Falco, Li?in. 

 1. F. Perigrinus, iiww. Perigrine Falcon. 



In passing and re-passing through this extensive range of country, during a 

 period of twelve months, I naet with this Falcon but once at Santa Fe, in the 

 month of June. Here, two were seen ; one of which was killed. This proved to 

 be a female, of immature age and plumage, answering to the following descrip- 

 tion : 



Length, 17 3-] Oths inches; alar stretch, 38 5-lOths inches; front, eyebrows, lores, 

 chin, throat, and a crescent around the occiput, extending to the eyes, light 

 brownish white ; head, back, scapulars, greater and lesser wing coverts and 

 tail coverts dark dusky, each feather margined with light brown, giving a mot- 

 tled appearance ; primaries, secondaries, tertials dark dusky, broadly and closely 

 barred with pale brown; tail dusky brown, tipped with paler brown, and all, 

 except the two middle feathers, thickly barred on the inner vanes with pale 

 brown; all the lower parts brownish white, striped with dark brown; under wing 

 coverts dark dusky, each feather with two to four spots of dull white, and edged 

 with the same ; cere greenish yellow ; feet lighter ; iris hazle ; middle toe and 

 nail 2 7-lOths in. 




214. [June, 



Circus, Lacep. 



2. C. Cyaneus, Li?m. Marsh Hawk. 



The Harrier I found in very great numbers on the plains stretching fronn the 

 Pecos river to the Apache mountains, in February ; whereas in October following 

 but few were seen in the same region; stragglers were, however, met with in 

 the lower plains, everywhere. 



Athene, Boie, 



3. A. Hypugcea, Bonap, [S. Cunicularia, Gmel.'] Burrowing Owl. 



This singular little owl I found, occasionally, along the Rio Grande, from Val 

 Verde to Santa Fe, and quite abundant in the Valley of Las Vegas. It was abroad 

 at all hours of the day, and often amused me with its odd manners; taking 

 wing at the near approach of my horse, and again alighting at the distance of a 

 few yards, when it would face towards me and make, almost uniformly, three 

 distinct and formal bows, with a mock solemnity that was irresistably ludicrous. 

 Between sunset and dark, however, I always observed them to be most numerous ; 

 and at this hour they were, also, more shy and less ceremonious. 



There is a general impression, that chis owl habitually takes up its abode in the 

 dominions of the " Prairie Dog" where, in company with the Rattlesnake, it 

 feeds freely upon the young marmots. That it has been found, in some regions, 

 in the dog towns, seems to be established on reliable authority ; indeed I have 

 conversed with more than one person who was a witness to the fact. Still, I 

 am rather disposed to look upon the fact as an accidental occurrence, than as an 

 instinctive or positive habit of the bird. My own experience, too, tends to any- 

 thing but the corroboration of this testimony; fori have met vfiVa Hypugaea 

 in various places, from Fort Gibson, in Arkansas, to the Rocky Mountains ; and 

 it has never, in one instance, been my fortune to find it in company with the 

 Marmot. 



On the high, dry plains between the Pecos river and the Apache mountains, J 

 rode for days through the dog towns, as they are called, and did not see a single 

 owl, although the whole land seemed vivacious with marmots. Again; both on 

 the east and west of the Valley of Las Vegas, where, as already observed, this 

 owl is found in great numbers, there are within a few miles of the edge of the 

 valley, on the high dry plains, extensive settlements of the marmots ; and yet I 

 never saw an owl about their burrows, in repeatedly passing through them. Nor 

 is the most usual food of this owl found on high sandy plains; but in low lands, 

 near water courses ; and here I have always found him most numerous. With a 

 view to satisfy my own mind on this point, I studied these animals closely, on 

 this expedition ; in the northern parts of New Mexico, in the months of August 

 and September; and in the Apache country in February and October. 



It may not, perhaps, be amiss to remark here, with respect to the reported 

 lihernating habits of the marmot, [Arctomys Ludoviciana,] that on the high 

 plains of the Limpia, and also on those among the Apache mountains, these fro- 

 licksome little fellows made their appearance above ground, in crowds, soon after 

 sunrise, and remained abroad, frisking and barking, until about 2 o'clock, P. M., 

 in the month of February, although the nights and mornings were cold the ther- 

 mometer sometimes indicating a temperature 10* or 12'" below the freezing point,- 

 at sunrise. What may be their habits in higher latitudes, where the earth is for 




1851.] 215 



long periods covered with deep snows, I have never had an opportunity to 

 observe in winter. 



Caprimtjlgi's, TAvn. 



4. C. Carolinensis, Brisa. Chuck-Wills-Widow. 



A few were met with in New Mexico, in June and July. 



Chordeiles, Swains. 



5. C. ViRGiNiANT-s, Briss. Night Hawk. 



Numerous about Santa Fe, and generally throughout N. Mexico, during the 

 summer months. 



Chelidon, Boie. 



6. C. BicoLOR, Vieill. White Bellied Swallow. 



Appeared at Santa Fe in May, and nested there, but was not numerous. 



CoTYLE, Boie. 



7. C. RiPARiA, Bote. Bank Swallow. 



Was more numerous than the last ; nesting also near Santa Fe. 



HiRUNDO, Linn. 



8. H. RUFA, Linn. Barn Swallow. 



This species was rather common at Santa Fe, nesting there. 



SiTTA, Linn. 



9. S. Carolinensis, Briss. Carolina or White Breasted Nuthatch. 



A few were seen in the mountains west of Santa Fe ; where they nested. 



10. S. Canadensis, Linu. Canada, or Red Bellied Nuthatch, 

 Not more than three or four were seen in N. Mexico. 



Anthus, Briss. 



11. A. LuDOviciANUs, Licht. Brown, or American Titlark. 



This little wanderer I saw in N. Mexico, in small flocks, late in autumn. 



Sialia, Swains. 



12. S. ARCTiCA, Swains. Arctic Blue Bird. 



Was first seen on the Rio Grande, about 60 miles below El Paso del Norte. 

 Here they were abundant in the month of March, and were usually collected near 

 the river bank, before sunset, in search of inserls ; when they proved themselves 

 expert in the pursuit, darting from the tops of tall bushes to seize their prey upon 

 the wing, and returning again, in the manner of true fly-catchers. In May, they 

 made their appearance at Santa Fe but were not numerous. Immediately on 

 their arrival, they prepared their nests ; one of these, built in the gravel bank of 

 an arroyo seco or dry creek, I examined. It was composed entirely of dry grass ; 

 but it was well formed, having high walls of considerable thickness, and con- 

 tained six eggs of a marine-blue color. The hole in which the nest was found, 

 and which was in the side of a perpendicular bank, about five feet from the bot- 

 tom, was four inches in diameter and ten in depth. Each brood, (generally seven 

 or eight, including the old birds,) seemed to keep united during the summer. 

 About the first of September, they began to move off". 




216 [June, 



MiMUS, Briss. 



13. M. MONTANUS, Bojiap. Mountain Mockingbird. 



I found this gallant bird at times, though rarely, on the mountain sides in 

 Northern New Mexico. I could not but admire his song, and his gay, dashing 

 character, althouirb I was constrained to admit the inferiority of his notes to those 

 of his inimitable congener. 



14. M. poLYGLOTTis, Boie. The Mockingbird. 



This bird was also rare in New Mexico, although it is abundant on the south 

 western frontier of Texas. 



CiNCLus, Bechst. 



15. C. Americanus, Swains. American Dipper. 



One pair, only, of C. A. was seen. These were found on a very rocky and 

 precipitous mountain stream, some twelve miles west of Santa Fe. 



MiLVHLUS, Swains. 



16. M. FORFicATTJS, Swains. Swallow-tailed Fly-catcher. 



This graceful bird was found in the south-western part of Texas, near Lavaca, 

 in December. 



Tyrannus, Vieill. 



17. T. vERTiCALis, Say. Arkansas Fly-catcher. 



Was found in Northern New Mexico, in August and September, in small 

 flocks. 



Tyrannula, Swains. 



18. T. Saya, Swains. Say's Fly-catcher. 



Was met with occasionally in the mountains near Santa Fe. 



Ctanocorax, Boie. 



20. C. Stelleri, Gmel. Steller's Jay. 



Was rather common along the mountain sides, between Santa Fe and Las 

 Vegas, in the months of August and September. 



21. C. uLTRAMARiNus, Bonap. Ultramarine Jay. 



This Jay, also, was seen in the same range with the preceding, during summer. 



21. C. Cassinii, Nobis. Cassin's Jay. 



Length 11 7-lOths inches; alar stretch 18 inches. Upper parts slate blue; front 

 and crown darker, almost black; chin and throat greyish white; cheeks and 

 sides of neck light blue ; wings same as back, the quills dusky on the inner vanes ; 

 below slate color, lighter than above ; iris dark brown ; bill and feet black. 



This Jay first made its appearance, about Santa Fe, in April, and remained 

 there, in considerable numbers, during the summer. It nested and passed the 

 midday in the highest mountains, coming down their sides upon the hills to feed, 

 morning and evening. At these times they moved in large, loose flocks, alter- 

 nately alighting to pick up an insect or a lizard, and again passing to the front ; 

 keeping up, the while, a regular cry, in a rather low plaintive tone, very different 

 from the Blue Jay. In this way they generally passed some time before sunset 

 amongst the scrubby white cedars of the hills, and then returned to the moun- 

 tains to roost. The bird from which the above description was taken, had, when 

 killed, just swallowed, entire, a ^^ horned frog" or lizard, [Agama Cornuta] 

 2i inches in length. 




1851.] 



217 



I desire to name this species, which is believed to be hitherto undescribed, 

 after Mr. John Cassin, of Philadelphia, to whose knowledge and indefatigable in- 

 dustry the Academy, of which I have the honor to be a corresponding member, is 

 so greatly indebted in the department of Ornithology. 



NuciFRAGA, Briss. 



23. N. Columbiana, Wils. Clark's Crow, or American Nutcracker. 



The habits of this bird I found, in some respects, resembling the preceding; 

 the character of its flight, however, is quite difTerent, partaking somewhat of the 

 undulating motion of the larger woodpeckers. I met with several flocks in the 

 high pine forests east of Santa Fe, and on the Taos mountain. 



CoRvus, Lhm. 



24. C. coRAx, Linn. Raven. 



The Raven I found everywhere throughout Texas and New Mexico. 



25. C. Americanus, Aud, Common Crow. 



This relative of the foregoing, I met almost as universally in the regions just 

 named. 



It has been remarked by our most distinguished Ornithologist, Wilson, in 

 speaking of the Raven, that " it is a remarkable fact, that where they (the ravens) 

 so abound, the common crow seldom makes its appearance ; being intimidated, 

 it is conjectured, by the superior size and strength of the former, or by an antipa- 

 thy which the two species manifest towards each other." This conclusion I 

 believe to be an error, into which this close observer and most accurate delinea- 

 tor was doubtless led, by some singularity of circumstances that does not often 

 obtain : for I have generally found rather a social feeling existing between these 

 congeners, arising, probably, from the gregarious disposition of each, and the 

 similarity of their food. On reference to my copy of Wilson's work, I find the 

 following note on the margin, which it may not be altogether amiss to transcribe: 

 " At Fort Gibson, in the Cherokee country, Arkansas Ter., the ravens were 

 more numerous than in any other part of the country I have ever visited ; the 

 crows also were very abundant there. During a period of two years and a half 

 that I was at that post, I daily saw the ravens and crows feeding amicably on the 

 same ground, and perched upon the same trees. I have also observed the same 

 thing here. Dated, Fort Scott, Osage country, March, 1S45." 



I may say further, that the same observations were made in Texas and N. 

 Mexico. 



PiCA, Briss. 



26. P. MELANOLEUCA, Vicill. Commou Magpie. 



One pair of these birds was seen near Turkey Creek, in Western Texas, early 

 in November, in the latitude of about 29* 15'. And the fact is only mentioned 

 on account of the rare occurrence of meeting a Magpie so far South. A storm 

 from the North had been prevailing on the plains for three days, and had no doubt 

 brought them with it, from the upper country. During the previous winter none 

 had been seen in N. Mexico, as low as 36 lat. 



Sturnella, Vieill. 



27. S. NEGLECTA, Aud. Western Meadow Lark. 



This bird appeared, in the month of February, in great numbers between the 



29 




218 [June, 



Leona and San Pedro rivers, (western Texas,) and was more or less common on 

 the whole route from Lavaca to Santa Fe. The song, I think, is superior to that 

 of S. LuDOviciANA." The only place at which I heard it was at Santa Fe, in the 

 spring months. 



ScoLECOPHAGUS, Swains. 

 28. S. FERUGiNEUs, Stoain.s. Rusty Blackbird. 



Was rather common along the Rio Grande to Santa Fe. 



QuiscALUS, Vieill. 

 29 Q. MAJOR, Vieill. Boat-tailed Blackbird. 



Was seen as far north as San Elizario, on the Rio Grande, lat 31 deg. 40 min. 

 I am induced to think it a rare visitor even here. I saw them in great numbers, 

 on a former occasion, near Matamoras, where they nested in large congregations. 



MoLOTHRUS, Swains. 



30. M. PECORis, Swains. Cow Blackbird. 



Seen in various parts of N. Mexico ; not numerous. 



Agelaius, Vieill. 



31. A. zanthocepualus, Bonap. Yellow-headed Blackbird. 



32. A. Phceniceus, Vieill. Red-winged Blackbird. < 



Were found only occasionally in N. Mexico; more common in Southern 

 Texas. 



Calamospiza, Bona}}. 



33. C BicoLOR Nntt. Prairie Reedbird. 



I first met with this bird on the Rio Grande, between Santa Fe and Canada, in 

 September, when several small flocks were seen. 1 again found thciii on the 

 Rio Puerco, in October. Their note and flight reminded me at once of our D. 

 Oryzivora ; but I found their flesh very inferior in delicacy and flavor to the 

 latter. 



Fringilla, Linn. 



34. F. Oregona, Toj^?Kt. Oregon Snow Bird. 

 Common near Santa Fe, in winter. 



PiriLO, Vieill. 

 33. P. ARCTicDS, Swains. Arctic Ground Finch. 



I found perhaps half a dozen individuals of this species about Santa Fe, in 

 May. 



Chondestes, Swains. 



36. C. Grammaca, Say. Lark Finch. 



Was found, in moderate numbers, on the plains near Santa Fe, in May and 

 June, when its pleasing song and gay manners attracted attention. 



Otocoris, Bo7iap. 



37. 0. alpestris, Bonap. Shore Lark. 



Appeared about Santa Fe in April, and became quite numerous in that region 

 in May. Was scarce in the autumn. 



38. O. ?occiDENTALis.* Probably the young of a species not heretofore 

 described. 




1851.] 219 



The bird from which the following description was taken, was shot near Santa 

 Fe, in the month of July. It had, in some respects, the appearance of an adult 

 bird, or at least a bird of the preceding year, although its general markings, to 

 judge from analogy, would indicate a young bird. Yet, judging from the firm- 

 ness of its bones, appearance of its bill, and a slight abrasion of the ends of the 

 tail feathers, 1 did not, at the time, take it to be a young bird. 



Its length (when killed) was 7 7-lOths inches ; alar stretch 11 inches ; wing, 

 from flexure, 3 7-lOths; above, light brown, each feather being dark dusky near 

 the tip, the extreme tip white giving the appearance of a mixture of light and 

 dark brown, thickly speckled with white ; in this respect resembling the young 

 of the Sliore Lark ; the greater and lesser wing coverts broadly edged with yel- 

 lowish white, and tipped with pure white, forming two distinct bars, most appa- 

 rent when the winj is extended ; the second primary longest, the third shorter 

 than the first, the outer vane of the latter white ; remaining wing feathers edged 

 with whitish, broadest on the tertials ; tail of twelve feathers, even, the two 

 middle ones light brown, edged with whitish, the r. r.iainder dark dusky, the two 

 exterior ones being white on the outer vanes; all the underparts pale brownish 

 white, most clear at the lower extreme ; bill slender and slightly curved, of a 

 horn color above, and lighter below ; eyebrows, extending back of the eyes, 

 whitish: irides dark hazel; legs and feet nearly black; hind nail longer than 

 the toe. 



The difference between this bird and the young of the Shore Lark, is in the 

 different dimensions, and in the whole of the under parts being whitish ; but more 

 particularly in the length and shape of the bill, which is longer, more slender, 

 and rather more curved above than that of the Shore Lark, either young or old. 



It is believed to be of a species of the genus Otocoris, hitherto unknown to 

 science. 



Carpodacus, Kaup. 

 [Erythrospiza, Bo7iap.'\ 

 39. C. FRONTALIS, Say. Crimson Fronted Finch. 



I found this charming little finch abundant at Santa Fe, where they commenced 

 nesting in March, although the weather was still wintry, and so continued, with 

 frequent snow storms, for more than a month. Notwithstanding this, the song 

 of the male failed not to cheer his mate, during incubation, with the liveliest 

 melody. The notes often reminded me of the soft trill of the house wren, and 

 as often of the clear warble of the canary. The males of the last year, though 

 mated and apparently equally happy and quite as assiduous as their seniors, were 

 not yet in full plumage, having little or nothing of the red colors that mark the 

 adult birds. 



The nests, which were stuck into every cranny about the eves and porticos of 

 the houses throughout town, were variously composed, of dry grass, fine roots, 

 horse-hair, long pieces of cotton twine, or strips of old calico ; in fine, of countless 

 odds and ends, that were picked up about the yards ; these were curiously and 

 firmly interwoven, so as to make a warm and comfortable abode for the new 

 comers. Eggs, four or five, pale blue, slightly marked on the larger end. The 

 young were able to fly by the middle or latter part of April. A second brood, 

 and, in some cases, I believe, a third was raised during the summer ; as not a few 




220 [June, 



of them continued to incubate until Sonne tinne in the month of August. Before 

 the latter part of September, however, nearly all of them had disappeared from 

 about Santa Fe. 



40. C. OBSCURUS, Nobis. Dusky Finch. 



Length (when killed) 6 inches ; wing 2 8-lOths inches ; front, crown and back, 

 dark brownish ash, striped with dark dusky brown; wings and tail dusky brown, 

 each feather edged with brownish white; the greater and lesser wing coverts 

 more broadly edged with the same, making two faint bars on the wing; all the 

 under parts dull white, striped with dark dusky brown ; tail slightly forked ; bill 

 slightly curved, upper mandible dusky, lower mandible paler, inclining to yel- 

 low; iris hazel; feet dark dusky. This was the female. 



The male, though with lighter colors, did not appear to differ greatly from the 

 female ; nor could I, at a short distance, distinguish the usual tinge of red that 

 marks this genus. 



The song of the male consists of a few pleasing notes, without the volume or 

 compass of voice of the preceding species. I was much disappointed in not being 

 able to secure the male. I saw but one pair ; and after following them for some 

 time and observing their habits ; having them in line, I shot the female, from my 

 horse, with a pistol, whereupon the male took wing, and eluded all further search. 

 The same ground was repeatedly hunted afterwards, but without success. This 

 was near Santa Fe. 



COLAPTES, Swaiiis. 



41. C. coLLARis, Vig. Red-shafted Woodpecker. 

 Appeared in N. Mexico in September. 



Geococcyx, Wagl. 



42. G. YiATicus, Wagler. Paisano. 



I met with this bird, occasionally, throughout western Texas and New 

 Mexico. 



EcTOPisTES, Swains. 



43. E. Carolinensis, Linn. Turtle Dove. 



This species is the only one of the family that I met with on this expedition. 

 It was very common in N. Mexico during the summer. On the Rio Grande fur- 

 ther South, I found on a former occasion, between Matamoras and Camargo, five 

 species, viz: Z.. Amabilis, Z. Leucoptera, C . rasseri7ia,l^. Carolinensis^ and 

 C. Solitaria. Most of them seem to confine themselves to the warmer latitudes. 



Oetyx, Seepk. 



44. O. ViRGiNiANA, Li)in. Common Quail, or American Partridge. 



Of four species oi Odontophorino: found in Western Texas, the habitat of each 

 of which is confined to an almost distinct locality or region, this was the first met 

 with on this occasion. It was extremely numerous about San Antonio ; and 

 thence, beyond the settlements to the San Pedro, or Devil's river, (a distance of 

 170 miles, westwardly, by the route travelled to the Rio Grande,) it was more or 

 less common. This region, it is worthy of note, is by far the best on the whole 

 route to El Paso; (a distance by the trail of 673 m.) That is to say, it is a better 

 watered country, has a richer soil, and produces spontaneously a greater variety 




1851.] 221 



of grasses and other plants, whose seeds afford abundant and nutritious food to all 

 kinds of ganne. I discovered no difference in the appearance or habits of this 

 bird, here, from those of the common quail of the Atlantic States. 



CyRTONYX, Gould. 



45. C. Massena, Gould. Massena Quail, or Partridge. 



This species was not seen before crossing the San Pedro : but it was not long 

 until it made its appearance in the waste and rocky region into which we then 

 entered. And from that time until we reached the Rio Pecos, a distance of 140 

 m., (westwardly by the route travelled,) it was frequently seen, though I should 

 not say it was very common. This region is a desert of great length from North 

 to South, our trail crossing it nearly at right angles. The general face of the 

 country is level, and consists of either a crumbling argillaceous limestone, or a 

 coarse grey sand, producing nothing but a sparse growth of sandpiants. Water 

 is found only at long intervals ; and except at these points there is but little cover 

 for game, and apparently less food, the principal growth being Cacti of which 

 the most common is C. arhorescens; yet here, amongst projecting rocks, or on the 

 borders of dry gullies, or in loose scrub, I found C. Massena in all the beauty of 

 his rich and varied plumage. 



The habits of this species are different from those of any other species of Part- 

 ridge that I have met with. They were in covies of from 8 to 12, and appeared to 

 be extremely simple, and affectionate in disposition. In feeding, they separated but 

 little, keeping up a social check all the time. They were so gentle as to evince 

 little or no alarm on the approach of man; scarcely moving out of his way as he 

 passed; and only running off or flying a few yards when perhaps half their num- 

 bers were laid low by a shot. This inclined me to think they might with little 

 difficulty be domesticated, although I found them, here, in a boundless barren 

 waste, and nowhere near the habitation of man. This trait of gentleness is the 

 very opposite of those strikingly manifested by the scaly partridge, which I always 

 observed to be, though found perchance in grounds as little frequented as these, 

 remarkably vigilant, shy, and difficult to approach. The call or signal note of 

 this species is peculiar. I never saw them alter crossing the Pecos river. 



LoPHORTYx, Bonaf. 

 46. L. Gambelii, Nutt. GambePs Quail, or Partridge. 



After losing sight of the last species, I did not fall in with this until we reached 

 the Limpia river, about 100 m. west of the Pecos. This beautiful bird, whose 

 habits in some respects bear more resemblance to the common partridge, like that, 

 seems to prefer a more genial and hospitable region. In this part of the country, 

 the Mesquite tree i^A. glandnlosa) is more or less common ; and the Mesquite 

 grass, and other plants bearing nutritious seeds, are abundant. Here, this part- 

 ridge increases rapidly in numbers, and becomes very fat. And, as I afterwards as- 

 certained, is much disposed to seek the farms, if any be within reach, and to cul- 

 tivate the acquaintance of man. About the rancho of Mr. "White, near El Paso, 

 I found them very numerous ; and here in gangs of 50, or 100, they resort, morn- 

 ing and evening, to the barn-yard, and feed around the grain stacks in company 

 with the poultry, where they receive their portion, as it is scattered among them, 

 by the hand of the owner. 



1 found them distributed through the country from the Limpia to the Rio 




222 [June, 



Grande, a range from east to west exceeding 100 m., and along the Rio Grande 

 from Eagle Spring Pass to Don Ana, a distance of 120 m. North of this, I did 

 not see them. I was not among them during the season of incubation. 



Callipepla, Wagler. 



Al. C. sQtJAMMATA, Wagler. Scaly Quail, or Partridge. 



This species I have met with, at different times, throughout a more extended 

 region than either of the last two, viz : from Camargo, onthe lower Rio Grande, 

 to Santa Fe. On the present occasion, they were more numerous between the 

 latter point and Don Ana than elsewhere. They seem to prefer the vicinity of 

 the greater water courses to interior tracts. They are much more wild than 

 either of the preceding, and being extremely watchful and swift of foot, they elude 

 pursuit with surprising skill, scarcely resorting to flight, even in comparatively 

 open, sandy ground. They do not approach the settlements as much as the last. 

 For the table, all. these species, however, ])0ssess in a high degree the requisites 

 of plump muscle and delicate flavour. Massena is perhaps the best. 



Tetrao, Linn. 

 AS. T. cvviDO, {L.)Wils. Pinnated Grouse. 



Were found in Texas, between Lavaca, Victoria, and Goliad. 



49. T. oBScuRus, Bouap. Dusky Grouse. 



A few flocks were seen in the mountains from Santa Fe to Taos. In Septem- 

 ber they were feeding on the berries of the White Cedar. 



[I should mention that the Wild Turkey (M. G.) was found on almost every 

 stream margined with timber, throughout the whole of the country traversed. On 

 the Nueces, Leona, and Turkey Creek, they were in great numbers.] 



Charadrius, Lin7i. 



50. C. vociFERUS, Li7in. Kildeer plover. 



This bird I found occasionally on the whole route. 



Himantoptjs, Briss. 



51. H. NiGRicoLLTs, Vieill. Black-necked Stilt. 



Occasional flocks were seen on the Rio Grande, as high up as San Elizario. 



Tringa, Linn. 



52. T. HiMANTOPUS, Botiap. Long legged Sand piper. 



I found a few birds of this species near San Elizario, in October. Their fa- 

 vorite range, however, does not extend far from the Gulf. On reference to my 

 notes, I find they were abundant about Corpus Christi, from September to March, 

 1845-6 ; at the termination of which period I hft them still there. They were 

 exceedingly numerous about Matamoras, during the following winter, and were 

 served at the tables of the Hotels and Restaurants very prodigally, as well as the 

 Chiac-chia-lacca. The Sandpiper was at this season very fat, and was considered, 

 by many, little inferior to the Snipe, (S. Wilsonii) for which it often passed. 



[I might remark, in passing, that the Chiac-chia-lacca, as it is called by the 

 Mexicans a name doubtlessly derived from its peculiar cry, which strikingly re- 

 sembles a repetition of those syllables is also a capital bird for the table. It is 

 the Penelope Poliocephala of Wagler ; and since the extension of our domain to 

 the Rio Grande, is now a bird of the United States. It is very numerous on the 




1851.] 223 



lower river, where the forests are made to echo with its shrill cry not unlike 

 that of the Guinea fowl. It is often domesticated by the Mexicans, and goes at 

 large about the grounds.] 



Grus, Linn. 



53. G. Americana, Temm. Whooping Crane. 



On the whole route I met with but one pair of this large crane. This was at 

 the Arroyo Hondo, in Texas, above San Antonio, in the month of November. I 

 find in my notes taken at Corpus Christi in 1845, that they were seen there occa- 

 sionally in pairs, or in parties of .3 or 4, but iiever in large flocks, nor in company 

 with tr; Canadensis, although the latter were innumerable. Here, this bird was 

 generally observed feeding at the water's edge ; mostly on the river banks or 

 around ponds of fresh water, but also quite frequently on the sandy points that 

 extended into the salt water of the Bay. Whereas, the Brown Crane frequented 

 mostly the low prairies at some distance from the Bay or River. 



54. G. Canadensis, Temm. Brown Crane. 



This Crane I found on the Rio Grande from Santa Fe to El Paso, in October; 

 but more particularly between Albuquerque and Sorocco, where, for 50 miles, 

 the land appeared to be covered with them. They filled the cornfields and alight- 

 ed close to the houses, never being disturbed by the gun. 



ScoLOPAX, Linn. 



55. S. WiLsoNii, Temm. Common Snipe. 



This bird I found almost every where from the Gulf to Santa Fe, where a patch 

 of wet ground was encountered, but nowhore were they numerous. In 1845, 

 numbers nested and raised their broods near Corpus Christi. 



NuMENXUs, Briss. 



56. N. BOREALis, Lath. Esquimaux Curlew. 



A few were seen on the plains east of the Rio Grande. 

 37. N. LONGiROSTKT,?, Wilson. Long biued Curlew. 



These were seen much more frequently than the last, and were common on the 

 plains near the Apache mountains. 



Cygnopsis, Brandt. 



58. C, Canadensis, Brandt. Canada Goose. 



I Jid not meet the Canada Goose until I reached the Rio Grande, which was at 

 a point 60 miles below El Paso ; thence I found them tolerably numerous until I 

 left the river near Santa Fe. 



Chen, Boie. 



59. C.HYPERBOREA, Boie. Snow Goose. 



Small flocks of this Goose were found occasionally in company with the last. 



Bernicla, Sieph. 



60. B. brenta, Sie;?A. Brant or Brent Goose. 

 A few only v/ere seen on the Rio Grande. 



Anser, Briss. 



61. A. eryturopus, Linn. White fronted Goose. 



This Goose was more common than the last , they we-r, as I have generally 




C24. [June, 



found them elsewhere, less shy than those of any other species. They seek out 

 little pools or mud puddles near the river, to which they resort to feed more ha- 

 bitually than their congeners; and here they are without difficulty approached 

 and shot. 



Cygnus, Li7i7i. 



62. C. BUCCINATOR, Rich. Trumpeter Swan. 



In Texas, I at times saw flocks of this swan at great heights, and heard their 

 wild, melancholy note, as they liesurely yet swiftly winged their way through 

 the upper air. 



Anas, Linn. 



The following species I found every where that water was found, in the plains 

 or among mountains, between San Antonio and the Rio Grande a distance, as the 

 crow flies, of over 400 miles. In the midst of extensive plains, I scarcely ever 

 approached a " water-hole" (or rain water pond) in which I did not find small 

 flocks of one or more species. 



63. A. BOSCHAS, Lin7i. Mallard Duck. 



64. A. STREPERA, Linn. Gadwell Duck. 



65. A. Americana, Gmel. Widgeon or Baldpate. 



66. A. Carolinensis, Steph. Green winged Teal. 



67. A. DiscoRS, Linn. Blue winged Teal. 



68. A. clypeata, -^iww. Shoveller Duck. 



The last, however, I saw only at San Elizario; where also, and generally along 

 the Rio Grande and Rio Puerco, and their mountain branches, nearly to the fool 

 of the Sierra delos Mimbres, I found most of the others which shows their ex- 

 tensive range.

It is usually observed with the posterior half or two-thirds of its body 

 projecting nearly vertically from its tube, with the caudal, contractile ap- 

 pendages expanded. Upon any disturbance it rapidly retreats within its tube. 

 A sessile species of vorticella is frequently found attached to the posterior part of 

 the body. 



At first sight there appears to be only three appendages each side of the anus, 

 but closer examination proves the existence of a fourth, small and not so dis- 

 tinct. 



Dr. Leidy, on behalf of the Curators, stated that he desired to cor- 

 rect an error which he had noticed in a report of some remarks by 

 Mr. Squier at a meeting of the American Ethnographical Society, in 

 which Mr. S. stated that Dr. Morton's collection of Crania had been 

 presented to the Academy. Dr. Leidy had ascertained from Dr. 

 Morton's Executors, that the collection had not been presented to this 

 Institution.

A letter was read from Thos. E. Yeateman, Esq., addressed to Geo. 

 W. Carpenter, dated St. Louis, June 16, 1851, in reference to a por- 

 trait of the late Dr. Gerard Troost, which he was about transmitting to 

 the Academy, as a donation from himself. 



Also, a letter from Mr. William Haidinger, dated Vienna, 6th June, 

 1851, acknowledging the receipt of his notice of election as a Corres- 

 pondent, and advising of the shipment of a present of books to the 

 Academy from himself and M. Hauer, and also the Year-book, sent 

 by the Royal Imperial Geological Institution of the Austrian Empire. 



Dr. Leidy stated that the Cicada septendecim, was subject to a fun- 

 gous disease. The posterior part of the abdomen he observed in seve- 

 ral instances to be filled with a mass of oval spore-like bodies, embos- 

 sed upon their surface, but becoming smooth from endosmosis when 

 placed in water. 



He also stated he had just received the dead larva of a lamellicorn 

 insect, which was filled with the same fungus which sometimes attacks 

 the mole cricket.

 acknowledging the receipt of late Nos. of the Proceedings. 



From Dr. Joseph Hyrll, dated Vienna, July 13th, 1851, acknowledg- 

 ing the receipt of his notice of election as a Corresponding Member. 



Mr. Cassin asked attention of the members to the specimens of owls 

 on the table. 



These specimens comprise parent male and female, and three young birds, 

 fully grown, which were reared in the woods at Powelton, the residence of John 

 Hare Powel, Esq., at whose hospitable mansion the members of this Academy 

 have been always made welcome. 



The adult male exhibits the plumage of the mottled owl, or Ephialtes navia, 

 {Gm.), the adult female that of the red owl, or E. asio, (Gtn.), and the young 

 birds, sufficiently feathered to be able to fly readily, and which were ascertained, 

 by dissection, to be two males and one female, are assuming the red plumage of 

 their parent female, but having evidently been previously of a grayish white 

 color, the entire plumage of the head and body above and below, with every 

 feather marked with transverse lines of dark reddish gray, very distinct, and not 

 seen in either of the adults. 



The present specimens must, of course, be regarded as fully demonstrating the 

 identity of the red and the mottled owl, and the only point now to be determined 

 is, whether the female ever becomes mottled. This, however, Mr. C. regarded 

 as very probably the case, as it is well established that rapacious birds of several 

 species breed before they assume mature plumage. 



Mr. Phillips made some remarks on a brilliant meteor, which he 

 had observed in this city on the evening of the 3d inst., taking a direc- 




1851.] 237 



tion apparently from West to East. The meteor was remarkable for 

 its bright green color. 



August \2th. 

 Vice-President Wetherill in the Chair. 



Dr. Leidy read a paper, entitled " Contributions to Helminthology, 

 No. 3," which was referred to Drs. Bridges, Watson, and Hallowell. 



Dr. Fisher, in adverting to a suggestion made at a late meeting of 

 the Academy, that it was probable that many of the insects which are 

 destructive to various trees of this country, were periodical in their 

 recurrence, resembling, in this respect, the Cicada septendecim, 

 remarked that six or seven years since the black caterpiller, or canker 

 worm, had been very destructive to the Elm trees at New Haven, but 

 that since then they were comparatively rare. On a visit to New 

 Haven this summer he found them again very numerous, and doing 

 great injury. 



August I9th. 

 Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



Dr. Leidy presented a paper entitled ''Conspectus Crustaceorum 

 quae in Orbis Terrarum circumnavigatione Carolo Wilkes e Classe Rei- 

 publicae Foederatae duce lexitet descripsit J. D. Dana ;" which, on mo- 

 tion was referred to the following Committee, Dr. Leidy, Dr. Bridges, 

 and Dr. J. C. Fisher. 



A letter was read from the "Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Wien," 

 dated April 30th, 18.51, in reference to the publications of that insti- 

 tution, announced this evening. 



Dr. Fisher read a paper describing a new species of Cicada, named 

 by him C. Cassinii, which being intended for publication in the Pro- 

 ceedings, was referred to Dr. Ruschenberger, Mr. C. E. Smith, and Dr. 

 Zantzinger. 



Mr. Cassin read a paper intended for publication in the Proceedings, 

 " Notes on the Cicada Cassinii, and on C. septendecim. Referred to 

 the above Committee. 



Mr. Cassin read a paper entitled "Descriptions of Laniadae," intended 

 for publication in the Proceedings. Referred to Col. G. A. McCall, 

 Mr. Harris, and Dr. Watson. 



Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members, to several fragments of fossil 

 ruminant ungulates, from Nebraska Territory. 



One of these is the greater portion of a cranium, which, in its perfect condi- 

 tion, had been about 7 inches in length. For the examination of this he expressed 

 his indebtedness to Dr. Hiram A. Prout, of St. Louis, who first pointed out the 

 remains of a gigantic species of Palaeotherium, from the same region in which the 

 present fossil was obtained. 



The teeth in the specimen are in a very much mutilated condition, but with 




238 [August, 



the aid of several fragments of upper maxillae containing perfect teeth, from seve- 

 ral otiier individuals of the same animal, received from the Smithsonian Institu- 

 tion, through Prof. Baird, the dentition in a great measure can be made out. 



The teeth form nearly a continuous row, as in Anoplotherium, the only inter- 

 val, being one of i of an inch between the canine and the first premolar. 



The canine is broken away, but judging from the fragment of the root, which 

 is 4 lines in diameter antero-posteriorly, it was well developed. The anterior 3 

 premolars are too much broken to obtain any knowledge of their form. The 

 fourth is like one-half of the true molars, and resembles closely, the correspond- 

 iug tooth of Cervus. 



The 3 true molars have exactly the same form, and very nearly the size as the 

 2 posterior superior molars, described in the Proceedings of this Academy, 

 Vol. iv. p. 47, as characterizing a genus under the name of Merycoidodon. 

 From the latter fact it might be readily supposed, that the fossil before us 

 belonged to Merycoidodon, but a fragment of a face of a smaller animal now ex- 

 hibited, received from Prof. Baird, contains the first and second true molars, mu- 

 tilated, which have the same form as the corresponding teeth of the preceding fos- 

 sil, but the fourth premolar has three cusps instead of two, like the former, indi- 

 cating that we may have animals of different genera, with true molars identical 

 in form. 



Neither of these fossils Dr. L. suspected belonged to Merycoidodon, for in it 

 the enamel of the teeth is rougher than in the former. 



For the first he proposed the name of Oreodon. 



The face of Oreodon has a remarkably cat-like expression, being depressed, 

 and as broad between the malar bones, as it is long. The orbits are closed poste- 

 riorly as in the ruminants, by the junction of the post-orbital process of the 

 OS frontis with that of the malar bone, and present outward, foiward, and up- 

 ward, less in the latter two directions than in the cats, but more so than in the 

 ruminants. 



Just anterior to the orbit, is a remarkably large lachrymal depression or lar- 

 mier, relatively several times larger than that of Cervus virginianus. 



The glenoid cavity is a broad, extensive, nearly flat surface, as in the rumi- 

 nants. 



The posterior portion of the head, relative to the face, is very narrow, 

 and resembles in its form the fragment of a cranium described in Vol. v., of the 

 Proceedings, p. 90, as characteristic of a genus under the name of Eucrotaphus. 



The temporal fossae are as large as in the carnivora, and lead to the impression, 

 with other characters given of the head, that flesh probably formed part of the 

 food of the animal. 



The species Dr. L. named Oreodon priscum.

Several fragments were then exhibited of a much smaller animal than the last, 

 consisting of the greater part of the inferior and superior maxillae, the latter con- 

 taining the 4th premolar and the true molars perfect, having the same form as those 

 of Oreodon priscum. To this species, the name of Oreodon gracile was given. 



The posterior two inferior molars have the same form as the corresponding 



ones of Merycoidodon.

The fragment of a face before alluded to having the same form of the superior 

 true molars as Oreodon, but differing from it in having 3 cusps to the fourth pre- 

 molar, belonged to an animal very closely allied to the latter genus. It possesses 

 the remarkably large lachrymal depression, which in this fossil appears to have 

 been more hemispherical than in Oreodon. The depression being of such a strik- 

 ing character in Oreodon and in this genus, the name Cotylops was proposed for 

 the latter. The only entire tooth preserved in the fragment of Cotylops is the 

 third premolar, the crown of which is antero-posteriorly oblong, constricted in 

 the middle so as to give in outline the form of 8. It has a single cusp, and pre- 

 sents an oval fossa about two lines long, postero-internally ; and a heel or short 

 tubercle antero-internally. 



The species was named Cotylops speciosa.

The fragment of cranium for which was proposed the name Eucrotaphus,* 

 from its great resemblance to that of Oreodon, and its proportions, with the close 

 alliance of Oreodon to Merycoidodon, Dr. L. suspected belonged to the latter 

 genus.

Helminthological Contributio7is. No. 3. 

 By Joseph Leidv, M. D. 



Gen. Nov. SYNPLECTA.f 

 Body nematoid, cylindroid, distinctly and coarsely annulated. Head composed 

 of two trilobed portions, between which is the mouth. (Esophagus long, simple. 



Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci., Vol. v. p- 90. -j-jvv together; mtxut^ I twine. 




240 [August, 



Intestine narrow, simple. Male, attenuated at the extremities; posteriorly rolled 

 into a spiral, and furnished ventrally with numerous tegumentary tubercles. 

 Penis short, corneous, composed of two lateral portions. Female anteriorly 

 attenuated; posteriorly terminating in a strong, thick, muscular acetabulum, with 

 a posterior conoidal depression containing a single strong, recurved hook. Anus 

 and generative apertures close together, just anterior to the muscular acetabu- 

 lum. Ovum elliptical, elongated at the poles. 



The female of this curious genus of nematoid entozoa attaches herself, by 

 means of the posterior hook, to the mucous membrane of the intestinal canal of 

 the animal it infests, while the male clings to the female by winding the poste- 

 rior part of its body spirally around the posterior part of the latter, retaining 

 itself in that position through the aid of the numerous tubercles upon its ventral 

 surface, which closely apply themselves to the part of contact in the female. 



1. Synplecta pendula, n. s. 



Body faintly reddish-white, cylindroid. Annulations with from 12 to 18 trans- 

 verse muscular striae. Lobes of the head nearly equal. CEsophagus very long, 

 cylindroid, slightly dilated inferiorly. Intestine narrow, cylindrical. 



Male. Length 4 to 5 lines ; breadth l-6th of a line. Posterior fourth of body 

 forming three turns of a spiral, furnished ventrally with about 20 longitudinal 

 rows of tegumentary tubercles, or small quadrilateral plates l-1600th in. long, by 

 1 2666th in. broad, extending as far back as the anus. Tail curved, conoidal, 

 l-60th in. long from the anus, furnished ventrally with 7 or 8 pairs of minute coni- 

 cal tubercles. (Esophagus l-5th line long, l-333d in. broad; intestine l-400th 

 in. broad. Penis l-200th in. long, conoidal, obtuse, bent at free extremity, com- 

 posed of two lateral halves. 



Female. 6 to II lines long, l-5th to l-4th line broad. Posterior extremity 

 bent, dilated, terminating in a thick, oval, strongly muscular receptacle or 

 acetabulum, truncated posteriorly and excavated into a deep conical cavity, con- 

 taining a strong hook, with the point directed forward, l-200th in. long, with a 

 base l-400th in. broad. CEsophagus, in an individual 8i lines long, 1 line long 

 by l-666th in. broad at commencement, l-333d in. at termination. Intestine 

 l-450th in. broad. Ovum l-570th in. long, l-3333d in. broad. 



Habitation. Stomach and commencement of the small intestine of Emys 

 guttata. 



Remarks. The female hangs suspended by its posterior hook from the mucous 

 membrane of the stomach of the Em.ys, in which it is parasitic, while the male 

 clings closely to the female by means of its spiral folds, retaining its position 

 readily from the roughness of surface produced by its numerous ventral tubercles, 

 and also those upon the tail. I found this entozoon three times, in 15 individuals 

 of Emys guttata. In one instance it was a large female ; in the second two, 

 average size females, and one male ; in the third instance the stomach was dis- 

 tended with the worms, of which about one in five or six was male, and usually 

 clung to the largest of the females. 



CUCULANUS, Miiller. 



2. CuCULANt'S TRISPINOSUS, M. S. 



Body reddish, narrow, cylindrical, finely striated, attenuated at the extremi- 

 ties. Mouth large, sustained by a red or brown corneous capsule, presenting 8 

 radiating ribs or lines upon each side of a middle line. CEsophagus of two per- 




1851.] 241 



tions ; the first, elongated pyriform; the second cylindroid, a little dilated at its 

 lower end. Intestine sinople, cylindrical, a little narrower than the ceso- 

 phagus. 



Male. 3 lines long, l-200th to l-160th in. broad at middle. Posterior ex- 

 tremity curved, acute, furnished on each side ventrally, with an expansion of the 

 integument, of nearly uniform breadth, ]-S00th in., to its termination, com- 

 mencing l-50th in. above the end of the tail, and perforated by 6 nearly equi- 

 distant respiratory canals. Tail l-300th in. long from anus. Anal and gene- 

 rative apertures indicated by a prominent lip, and separated by a small conical 

 papilla. Penis consisting of two corneous, curved spiculae; one l-56th in. long, 

 the other l-200th in. long. 



Female. Viviparous, 6 lines long, 1-lOOth to l-90th in. broad. Tail straight, 

 long conoidal, 1-lllth long from anus, obtuse, terminated by 3 minute points 

 l-4000th in. long. Generative aperture surrounded by a very prominent lip, a 

 little posterior to the middle. First portion of oesophagus l-66th in. long; 1 -200th 

 in. at broadest part ; second portion, l-56th in. long. 



Habitatio7i. Small intestine of Emys guttata. 



T^NIA, Linn. 



3. TjENIA PtJLCHELLA, n. S. 



White, without any admixture of any other color, variable, usually broadest 

 anteriorly. Head quadrilateral, sub-clavate, obtusely rounded, broader than the 

 neck. Acetabula circular, cup-shaped, lateral and opposite, sessile, protractile. 

 Neck very long, cylindroid. Articuli containing several colorless globules ; an- 

 teriorly subglobular or transversely oval; posteriorly moniliform, longitudinal- 

 ly oval, or cylindroid and centrally incrassate. 



Measjiremeiits. Longest 9 in. Articuli commencing to be distinctly separate 

 4 in. from the head. Breadth anteriorly I line; posteriorly l-6th line. Anterior 

 articuli l-6th line long; posterior \ line. Acetabula, l-166th in. diameter. 



Smallest 2 in. Head, l-75th in. broad. Articuli commencing distinctly sepa- 

 rate J in. from the head. Broadest part of neck, l-90th in. ; short distance pos- 

 terior to the head, l-125th in. Anterior articuli 1-lOOth in. diameter ; posterior 

 l-44th in. long; l-200th broad at extremities, l-133d in. broad at middle. Ace- 

 tabula, l-200th in. diameter. 



Habitation. Small intestine of Bufo americanus. 



Remarks. Closely resembles the Taenia dispar, Goeze, found in the Bufo viri- 

 dis, etc., but it is relatively longer and narrower, and is never colored. 



PLANARIA, Muller, 



4. PlaNARIA SYIVATICA, 71. S. 



Body elongato-fusiform, thick, becoming narrowed forward, smooth, shining ; 

 superiorly convex, grayish with a fuliginous stripe down each side of the dorsal 

 line, and a transverse spot of the same color, at, or just posterior to the centre : 

 inferiorly compressed, whitish ; anteriorly attenuated, proboscidiform ; tip re- 

 curved, fuliginous, obtuse; posteriorly broadest, terminating acutely. Eyes 

 two, black, globular, lateral, slightly prominent. 



Length 2 to 5 lines ; breadth at the anterior fourth, |th of a line ; at posterior 

 fourth, |th of a line. 




242 [August, 



Habitation. Beneath stones, flower-pots, and boxes, in gardens in Philadel- 

 phia, and under fragments of wood, bark, old logs, etc., in forests in the neighbor 

 hood of Philadelphia. 



Remarks. This is the first terrestrial planaria which has been detected in 

 North America. I accidentally discovered it first beneath several flower boxes, 

 and pots in the small garden attached to my residence in this city, since which, I 

 sought for and found it in the hilly woods bordering the Wissahicon Creek and 

 Schuylkill River. In its movements it resembles a slug (Limax,) and like this 

 leaves behind it a mucous trail. When in motion, the anterior portion of the 

 body is much elongated, and very narrow, and the portion anterior to the eyes is 

 recurved. Frequently it raises the anterior third of the body from the ground, 

 moving it from side to side as if in search of something. The recurved portion 

 inferiorly, is flat, with the edges often inflected. 



When at rest, the body is contracted into an oblong form, and the head lies 

 doubled upon the back. The longest will contract to 2i lines in length by i a 

 line in breadth, and jrd line thick posteriorly, and |th line wide anteriorly. 



The coloring matter upon the back is arranged in faint transverse annuii, accu- 

 mulating upon each side of the middle into a longitudinal line, and a transverse 

 spot about the centre. 



The eyes are globular, apparently composed of a vitreous humor, two-thirds 

 enveloped with a black pigment. They are situated laterally, the l-lOOth to the 

 l-48th of an inch posterior to the extremity of the head, tnd measure about the 

 l-500th in. in diameter. 



The mouth is inferior and a little posterior to the centre. (Esophagus keg-shaped, 

 about l-50th in. long. From the acute tail end is secreted a delicate mucou sthread. 



The planaria appears not to like the water, for although it will live for some 

 hours beneath the surface, when prevented from rising, yet it always seeks to 

 leave it and remains out when it has escaped. 



In the same forest localities with the planaria, is found an insect larva, possess- 

 ing similar habits, which upon careless inspection might be mistaken for it. The 

 movements of the larva are more rapid and vermicular. 



PLANARIA, Muller. 

 Sui-geiius nov. Bdelloura.* 

 Characters same as Planaria, without tentaculae, and the posterior extremity of 

 the body separated by a constriction serving as a disk of attachment. 



5. Bdelloura parasitica, n. s. 



Body milk white, with a faintly yellowish intestine showing through the trans- 

 lucent integument, smooth, thin, lanceolate, or spatulate ; anteriorly narrowed, 

 obtuse ; lateral margins, thin, undulating ; constricted portion posteriorly trun- 

 cated, nearly as broad as the middle of the body. Eyes two, reniform. (Eso- 

 phagus simple, cylindrical, campanulate when protruded. 



Length from 3 to 10 lines; breadth 2-5ths to 23th lines. The longest may 

 contract to 6 lines by 3j lines. 



Habitation Parasitic upon the King Crab, Polyphemus occidentalis. Lam. 



*fibiXKa, a leech ; goi tail ; because the animal adheres by the tail like a 

 leech. 




1851.] 243 



Found often in great numbers, adhering with considerable tenacity by means of 

 the posterior constricted extremity of the bodj', to the under surface of the bran- 

 chial covers, the branchial laminas, and to the extremities, especially in the vicini- 

 ty of the joints. 



Remarks. When the king crab is removed from the water, its planaroid para- 

 site retires to the deepest recesses between the limbs and other external organs 

 to avoid evaporation. The parasite moves with a gliding motion like the species 

 of Planaria, and also by fixing the posterior extremity and extending the anterior 

 part of the body to its greatest length, and then abruptly detaching and drawing 

 forward the former, like the leeches. At other times it fixes itself posteriorly, 

 and waves the anterior portion of the body to and fro through the water. 



Attached to the branchial lamina; of the king-crab, are frequently observed 

 ochreous or brownish, oval, compressed cysts, from ith to 2 lines long, and l-6th 

 to 1 line broad, attached by a short pedicle at one extremity, and unusually close- 

 ly applied to the surfaces between the branchial laminae, which are receptacles 

 or ova ? of the Bdelloura parasitica. Occasionally the margin of the cysts 

 is provided with a fringe of short, irregular, blackish filaments. Sometimes these 

 cysts exist in such numbers as to have the appearance of flaxseed sprinkled be- 

 tween the branchial laminae. 



6. Bdelloura rustica, n. s. 



Body brownish or blackish, translucent, lanceolate; anteriorly narrowed, ob- 

 tuse ; lateral margins thin, undulating ; constricted portion truncated posteriorly, 

 with parallel margins. Eyes two, reniform. ffisophagus simple, cylindrical. 



Length 2 to 3 lines; breadth 2-5ths to 4-5thsof a line. 



Habitation. Egg Harbor bay. New Jersey, upon Ulva latissama, Li?in. 



RemarZs. Movements same as in the preceding species. When free in water 

 it moves with great rapidity, and rises to the surface in the manner of the leech, 

 or the larva of the gnat. 



Gen. nov. MYZOBDELLA.* 

 Body elongated, compressed fusiform, smooth. Head continuous with the body, 

 subindibuliform, obliquely ventrally terminal. Mouth central, unarmed. Ace- 

 tabulum ventrally obliquely terminal, concave, not corneous. 



7. Myzobdella lugubris, n. s. 



Body cylindro-fusiform, in transverse section, elliptical, black olivaceous 

 green ; anteriorly narrowed, cylindroid ; posteriorly incrassate. From 15 to 18 

 annulations. Integument translucent, permitting the sacculated intestine of a 

 black green hue, to be visible. Acetabulum circular, concave, a little larger than 

 the oral disk. 



When elongated 10 lines, by i line in breadth posteriorly, l-5th of a line ante- 

 riorly. Will contract to 4 lines by 4-5ths line in breadth. 



HabitatioJi. Parasitic upon the common edible crab, Lupa dicantha, M. Edw.' 

 usually found attached about the base of the limbs. 



MECKELIA, Leucicart. 



8. Meckelta lactea, n. s. 



Body very soft, milk white, in transverse section lenticular, convex above and 

 below ; when extended, very much compressed, more especially posteriorly, in- 



*^D^w, I suck ; jiSSfTiXa, a leech. 

 32* 




244- [August, 



crassate rounded just posterior to the head ; lateral margins, thin, undulating; 

 posterior extremity thin, sub-acute. Head compressed, conical or hastate, ante- 

 riorly obtuse, breadth at base 1 line; lateral cleft li lines long. Generative 

 aperture longitudinally oval. 



Greatest length 6 inches: ordinarily 5 inches, by 3 lines in breadth, and 1 line 

 in thickness: may contract to 1 inch in length, by 2 lines in breadth, and 11 lines 

 in thickness. 



Habitation. In mud and sand under stones, dead shells, etc., in positions un- 

 covered at low tide, upon the coast of Great Egg Harbor, New Jersey. 



Remarks. The more it is extended the broader and thinner it becomes, espe- 

 cially posteriorly. When free in water, it swims like the eels, and in such cases, 

 the broad surfaces of the body are more or less vertical. 



9. Meckelia rosea, n. s. 



Body bright flesh-colored with fainter lateral margins, and a central' darker 

 line inferiorly ; in transverse section oblong, convex superiorly, flattened inferior- 

 ly ; when elongated, becomes cylindroid; posteriorly, obtuse. Head compressed, 

 conical or hastate, whitish. Generative aperture distinct, round. 



Length from 2 to 6 inches ; ordinarily about 5 inches. 



Hahitation. With the preceding species. 



'Remarks. As it elongates it approaches more the cylindrical form, becoming 

 thicker and narrower. 



The Committee on Mr. Cassin's descriptions of new species of Lania- 

 dae, reported in favor of its publication in the Proceedings. 



Descriptions of new species of birds of the family Laniadce, specimens of which 

 are in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. 



By John Cassin. 



1. Lanius paliidirostris, nobis. 



Form. Bill rather long and compressed, wings rather short with the third 

 quill distinctly longest, general form robust, and that of typical Lanius. About 

 the size of L. septentrioiialis, Gm. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail, about 8i 

 inches, wing 4|, tail 4J inches. 



Colors. Adult. Bill pale horn color. Upper surface of the head, with the 

 back and runnp pale cinereous, scapulars white and conspicuous, wings with a large 

 patch of white on the primaries, and with the secondaries broadly tipped with 

 white. 



A stripe of black through the eye, very narrow on the nares, but wider behind 

 the eye. Entire under-surface white, with a delicate, pale rosy tinge, most ob- 

 servable on the breast. Tail, with the two external feathers on each side, white, 

 each with a narrow longitudinal line of black on the shaft, slightly widening 

 into both webs, other tail feathers black, tipped with white, except the two in the 

 centre, which are pure black. Tarsi and claws pale brown. 



Hah. Eastern Africa. 



Obs. This fine species, of which there is one specimen only in the Rivoli col. 

 lection, may be distinguished readily from all others known to me by its very 




1851.] 245 



pale horn-colored bill, and the pale rose-red tinge of the under parts of the body. 

 The cinereous plumage above, is paler than that of L. excubitor, and it is without 

 the white patch on the middle of the sccondiric.<!, which is so obvious in that spe- 

 cies. It is more nearly related to L. meridioiialis, but is smaller and much 

 lighter colored. 



2. Lanius pallens^ nobis. 



Form. Bill rather weak, wings and tail rather long, but with the general form 

 of typical Lanius. About the s\ze oi L. viinor, Gm. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about S inches, 

 wing 4, tail 4| inches. 



Colors. (Specimen not in mature plumage.) Rump and entire under surface 

 pure white. Head above and back cinerous, wings black, with a large patch of 

 white on the middle of the primaries, and with the secondaries edged and broadly 

 tipped with white, tail, with the two external feathers on each side white, with 

 the shafts black, others black with white tips, very narrow on the four central 

 feathers. 



A black stripe through the eye, above which is a stripe of white. 



Bill and tarsi dark horn-color. 



Hab. Fazogloa, Eastern Africa. 



Obs. This species considerably resembles the preceding, but differs in having 

 the rump white, and appears to be, so far as preserved specimens can be relied 

 on, a smaller and more slender bird ; the bill is not so long nor powerful. Two 

 specimens are in the Rivoli collection, neither of which are fully adult. 



3. Laniarius quadricolor, nobis. 



Form. Much resembling that of L. gutturalls (Baud.) but is smaller, and the 

 tail more rounded. Wings short, rounded, fourth, fifth and sixth primaries longest 

 and nearly equal. 



Dime7isions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail, about 7J 

 inches, wing 3 J, tail 3i inches. 



Colors. 5 Adult. Generally resembling those oi L. gutturalis {Baud.) but 

 with the abdomen and ventral region yellow and the basal portion of the tail 

 olive green. Entire superior surface of the head, body, and wings olive green, 

 which is also the color of a basal third of the external, and of three -fourths of 

 the central tail feathers. Throat fine scarlet, stripe through the eye and wide 

 pectoral band, black; beneath the latter a badly defined band of yellowish scarlet? 

 fading into the rich greenish yellow of the abdomen, under tail coverts yellowish 

 scarlet. Bill black, paler at the base, tarsi and feet pale brown. 



5 young. Resembling the adult, but with the tail entirely green, and the 

 throat, under parts of the body and inferior tail coverts pale greenish yellow; a 

 trace of black lines on the feathers of the breast, and of scarlet on those of the 

 throat. 



Hab.Voit Natal, Eastern Africa. 



Obs. Of this beautiful bird two adult males and several young birds are in the 

 collection of this Academy. They are from the collection of Mr. Verreaux of 

 Paris, and were acompanied by this significant memorandum, "considereecomme 

 differente de la gutturalis.'' 1 have invariably found that M. Verreaux's opinion 

 of species is of the greatest value, in fact almost infallible. 




246 [August, 



This bird may readily be distinguished from the larger L. gutturalis , of which 

 we have specimens also, by the characters above indicated, and especially by its 

 yellow abdomen. 



4. Drynscopus suhladeus, nobis. 



Form. Bill and legs rather long, wings rounded with the fourth to the 

 eighth quills nearly equal and longest, plumage of the rump downy and profusely 

 developed. Somewhat larger than D. Gamhejisis (Licht.) 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail, about 1\ 

 inches, wing 3i, tail 2,\ inches. 



Colors. Adult. Entire plumage of the head and body above, wings and tail 

 glossy black ; downy plumage of the rump grayish white at base and tipped with 

 black, (as in D. rufiventris (Swainson) Le Vaill. Ois. d'Af. pi. 68, and D. ethio- 

 picus, (Gm.) Rupp. Uebersicht, pi. 23.) 



Under plumage entirely very pale ochraceous white or cream color, deepest on 

 the flanks, (same color as in D. ethiopicus.) No white markings on the wings 

 nor other part of the plumage. 



Bill black, tarsi paler. 



Hab. Eastern Africa? 



Obs. A. general resemblance exists between the bird now described and seve- 

 ral other species of Dryoscopus, but it is peculiar in having the fine cream-colored 

 under surface of the body, and no white marks whatever on the wings. 



5. Dryoscopus atrialatus, nobis. 



Form. Bill long, wings with the fourth quill longest, tail rather long and ample. 

 Generally similar to D. affinis (G. R. Gray,) but is larger, being about the size 

 of D. Gamie7isis (hicht.) 



Comparative Dimensions. 



D. atrialatus. D. affinis. 

 Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail, about H 6i inches, 



wing, 4 3i 



tail, 3J 21 



Colors. Adult. Very similar to those of JD. affinis (G. R. Gray) and gene- 

 rally to those of Chaiinonotus Sabinei (J. E. Gray.) 



Entire upper surface, except the rump, deep black ; under parts and rump 

 white. Wings clear black, with no white edgings or tips to either quills or 

 coverts, tail black, shafts of the feathers white at base beneath, bill black, tarsi 

 brown. 



Inferior wing coverts black, (white in D. affinis.) 



Hab. Eastern Africa ? 



Obs. One specimen only of this bird is in the Rivoli collection. It was labelled 

 " L. Sabinii," having evidently been mistaken for Cha^monotus Sabinei above 

 alluded to, which has recently been added to the collection of the Academy, but 

 from which the bird now described is generically distinct. It is very similar to 

 D. afBnis, but may readily be distinguished by its larger size and black inferior 

 wing coverts.

September 2(1, 1851. 

 Vice President Bridges in the Chair, 



A letter was read from the Trustees of the New York State Library, 

 dated Albany, August 1 1th, 1851, acknowledging the receipt of late 

 numbers of the Proceedings. 



Also a letter from Mrs. Charlotte K. Townsend, dated Philadelphia, 

 1851, returning her acknowledgments for certain resolutions recently 

 adopted by the Academy. 



Mr. Lea remarked that he had observed in a recent number of the Proceedings 

 of the Boston Society of Natural History, a communication on the subject of the 

 " Wave Theory," in regard to the dynamics of earthquakes. He observed that 

 this " wave theory" was by no means of as recent a date as was generally ima- 

 gined, and stated that Dr. Franklin, while in France in 1782, distinctly suggested 

 this wave motion, produced by a central force reaching to an immense distance. 

 Mr. L. read part of Dr. Franklin's letter to the Abbe Soulavie, (Trans. Am. 

 Phil. Soc, Vol. 3, p. 1, old series,) dated at Passey, September 22d, 1782, in 

 which he says, " But we are still subject to the accidents on the surface, which 

 are occasioned by a wave in the internal ponderous fluid : and such a wave is pro- 

 ducible by the sudden violent explosion you mention, happening from the junction 

 of fire and water under the earth, which not only lifts the incumbent earth which 

 is over the explosion, but impressing with the same force the fluid under it, 

 creates a wave that may run a thousand leagues, lifting thereby successively 

 all the countries under which it passes." 



September 9th. 

 Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



A communication was read from Aug. A. Gould, M. D., and D. 

 Humphreys Storer, M. D., Executors of the late Thomas Binney, M. D., 

 of Boston, dated Boston, July, 1851, presenting, in accordance with 

 his will, a copy of Vols. 1 and 2 of his work on the Terrestrial Mol- 

 lusks of the United States. 



Dr. Leidy called the attention of members to a fragment of rock a 

 few inches square, covered upon one surface with numerous root-like 

 fibres, which he stated belonged to a species of branching, fresh water, 

 ciliated polyps of the genus Plumatella. The piece had been broken 

 from a slab 18 inches square, which was entirely covered upon its 

 under surface in the same manner. The species he characterized as 

 follows : 



PLUMATELLA, Bosc. 



Plumatella diffusa, n. s. 



F olypidom, diverging from a centre over large surfaces, consisting of a series 

 of simple curved branches, from one to two lines long, rising from one another 

 upon the convex side, and attached throughout their length except at the extremi- 

 ties for l-4th to 2-5ths of a line, which are erect, keg-shaped, or a little dilated 

 at the middle and contracted at the orifices. Border of the orifices deeply emar-

ginate and continuous with a fiss\ire down the inner or concave side ot t!ie 

 branches, upon the summit of a slight ridge. Colour dirty olivaceous brown, 

 with the erect extremities of the branches yellowish or translucent wliitish. 



Polyp with 42 divergent, sigmoid tentaculae, arranged at their summits in the 

 outline of a reniform. disk. Length of the tentaculas about 3-5ths line. Color of 

 the stomach greenish yellow. 



Ovum with its marginal sheath semi-oval, l-6Sth in. long, l-333d in. broad. 

 Sheath whitish, translucent, smooth, cellular; with the aperture upon its convex 

 side 1-I42d in. in diameter ; that upon the flat side l-133d in. Ovum lenticular, 

 reddish brown. 



Ilahitation. Upon the under surface of stones which do not come in contact 

 entirely with the ground, in running brooks and creeks emptying into the Schuyl- 

 kill and Delaware rivers, and also in the latter. 



Hemarhs. This species of Plumatella appears to prefer for its residence stones 

 of large size. It is not common to find it upon such as are under 3 or 4 inches 

 square, but is frequently seen covering surfaces closely from one to several feet 

 square, upon which I have counted from 150 to 300 polyps to the square inch. It 

 also flourishes best in the course of currents of moderate strength. 



The object of its occupying the under surface of stones appears to be not so 

 much to escape from the light, as it is to favour the removal of the abundant ex- 

 crement, which is voided in the form of oblong, greenish or clay colored pellets. 



The interior structure of Plumatella corresponds pretty closely with those of 

 Alcyonella. 



The extruded ova are frequently found attached to rocks, generally by the flat 

 side, but sometimes by the convex side. 



The sheath of the ovum is composed of transparent colorless cells, about the 

 l-4000th In. diameter. 



Whilst observing this species of Plumatella beneath a lens, 1 noticed 

 several small aquatic larvae, probably of a species of Hydrophilus according 

 to my friend Dr. Le Conte, which would advance the anterior part of the 

 body, up the erect portion of the branches of the polypidom, with all the 

 stealth of a spider, until upon a level with the margin of the orifices, when they 

 would suddenly dart with great rapidity upon the body of the polyps : but in 

 every instance for a quarter of an hour in which I observed them, the latter suc- 

 ceeded in escaping by contracting within the tubes, where the larvte appeared 

 not to be disposed to follow them. 



Dr. Leidy observed that he had for some time past been collecting 

 materials towards elucidating the natural history of the family of Gor- 

 diacese, Siebold, upon which he was now preparing a memoir for the 

 Journal. 



Our most common species has been confounded with the Gordius aquaticus, L., 

 of Europe, but a striking character at once proves it to be distinct. The caudal 

 extremity of the female is trifurcated, while that of the European species is 

 blunt.* The length is from 4 to 12 inches. Of this species there are several 

 varieties from different localities, which may upon further comparison prove to 

 be distinct species. 



To this species the name Gordius varius was proposed. A second species of 



Siebold : Arch. f. Naturg. 1835, p. 303. 




1851.] 



263 



Gordius was obtained by Professor Baird from a spring in Essex county, New- 

 York. It is very much more delicate than the former, and from 5 to 7 inches 

 long. The female caudal extremity is blunt The male caudal extremity is bi- 

 furcate and fringed with peculiar epidermoid appendages. 



For this second species the name Gordius lineatus was proposed. 



Dr. L. also had found several remarkable species of Mermis, Dujardin. 



Eleven specimens of one species were procured by Dr. Budd from a ditch in 

 New Jersey. These are yellowish white in color, and from 6 to 18 inches in 

 length. To the species the name Mermis elongata was given. 



A second species was found in a ditch near Philadelphia. It is pure white in 

 color, 8 inches long, and has a peculiar tubercular thickening of the integument 

 upon the caudal extremity. For this species the name Mermis crassicaudatawas 

 proposed. 



Dr. L. further remarked that he had lately had an opportunity of repeating his 

 former investigations* upon the embryology of Gordius varius. 



The embryology of Gordius aquaticus, L., had been studied and published by 

 Grubyf before he had published his notes, but he did not know it at the time, 

 which he considered important, as the observations conducted in two parts of the 

 world, though differing in several specific points, were generally confirmatory of 

 one another. 



The perfect embryo of Gordius varius differs so much from the parent that it 

 is impossible to recognise the latter in the former. This has two circles of pro- 

 tractile tentaculas, each of six, and a protractile proboscis, not uncinate, however, 

 as in the embryo of Gordius aquaticusj, no trace of which exist in the parent. 

 The body of the embryo consists of two portions, and is distinctly annulated, 

 while the parent is simply hair-like in form, and has no trace of an annulated in- 

 tegument. Gruby remarks he never saw the Gordius, excepting the embryo, 

 shorter than 31 inches, so that between the annulose, tentaculated embryo, in the 

 Gordius varius the l-466th of an inch in length, and the parent of at least 3| 

 inches, nothing whatever is known of the history of the animal. Gordii have been 

 stated upon numerous and the most reliable authorities to have been seen in the 

 body of insects, so that from the embryo to the parent, there may probably be a 

 series of forms in alternating generation, entozoic and ectozoic, as numerous and 

 unlike as has been observed in the development of certain species of Distoma. 



The Gordius varius is prolific in a very remarkable degree. A female 9 inches 

 in length placed in a tumbler of water, September 25th, up to the present time 

 has extruded a string of ova 49 inches in length and still actively continues the 

 process.

Dr. Leidy presented a paper entitled " Conspectus Crustaceorum 

 quse in Orbis Terrarum circumnavigatione, Carolo Wilkes e Classe 

 ReipublicEe FcederatEe duce, lexit et descripsit J. D. Dana," intended 

 for publication in the Proceedings of the Academy. Referred to the 

 committee on a former paper on the same subject by Mr. Dana. 



A letter was read from the Imperial Society of Naturalists of Mos- 

 cow, dated 6th and 18th May, 1851, presenting the numbers of the 

 Bulletin of that Institution announced this evening. 



Dr. LeConte exhibited a series of tertiary fossils from San Diego, California ; 

 they bore the closest resemblance to species now living on that coast : the forma- 

 tion is of great extent along the coast, although very narrow. In passing from 

 San Diego to the Colorado river, he observed that these tertiary beds were soon 

 succeeded by various kinds of porphyry, and these by sienitic metamorphic rocks; 

 the upper beds of these exhibited a very curious arrrangement, being light co- 

 loured, with fusiform masses of darker sienite, all placed with their longitudinal 

 axes parallel. The sections of these masses were 5 18 inches long, and li to 

 3 inches thick; these metamorphic rocks became more granitic, and in some 

 places gneissoid in their character towards the central part of the Sierra. Near 

 "Valleido these micaceous strata were much contorted. The eastern range of the 

 Sierra at this point consists entirely of a very coarse conglomerate, containing 

 rounded masses from the above mentioned metamorphic rocks of immense size : 

 the cement is granitic gravel, with a very small amount of calcareous matter. 

 Dr. LeConte was inclined to consider this chain, which is near 5000 feet high, as 

 belonging to the cretaceous epoch ; it is flanked by a smdl deposit of unstratified 

 drift, which becomes stratified a few miles distant from the base of the moun- 

 tains. Underlying the drift is a tertiary formation containing small beds of sand- 

 stone and gypsum, precisely as at San Diego: only Ostrea were found in these 

 beds. In a small hill north of Cariso Creek, he had found limestone beds com- 

 posed almost entirely of Gnathodon, and farther in the desert the same shell was 

 found in strata of clay, lying almost vertically. The desert has two levels, the 

 lower being covered with alluvium, containing numerous Planorbis and Anodon, 

 with smaller freshwater species now inhabiting the Colorado; the upper level is 

 about .^0 to 70 feet above this alluvium, and consists of stratified matter usually 

 verv sandv, and belongs to the drift epoch. The range of sand hills is formed 

 from the lighter portions of this upper level near the edge. In the northern part 

 of the desert is a salt lake, on the edge of which is a solfatara with boiling water 

 and mud; some of the water issues in jets from small cones of inspissated mud, 

 which form over the circular pools. The water deposited large quantities of sal 

 ammoniac tinged with sulphur, and within a short distance from these pools are eight 

 small volcanic mounds of lava and pumice ; for many miles stranded pieces of 

 pumice are found on the alluvial level. 



Dr. LeConte also expressed his opinion that the Vancouver Island coal belong- 

 ed, like that found in Oregon, to the tertiary epoch; it was very fragile and light, 

 exhaled a peculiar odor which is characteristic of tertiary lignites. 



It existed in a single stratum (as he learned from persons who had visited the 




1851.] 



265 



bed,) of 22 inches in thickness, horizontal, and but a short distance from the sur- 

 face. The shafts sunk had not yet reached any other deposit. 



No distinct vegetable impressions had been found, although Dr. L. had carefully 

 examined a large quantity of the coal. He considered the existence of true car- 

 boniferous deposits in California highly improbable. 



Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to a pyrlform mass, about 

 three inches lono; by one and a half broad at the base, suspended in a 

 vessel of water. This, he said, consisted of numerous Polypi within their 

 Polypidom encrusting a dead branch of a tree, and was taken from a 

 similar mass one yard long, with an additional lateral branch two feet 

 long, found in a ditch below the city. The species he characterized as 

 follows : 



CRIST ATELLA, Cuv. 



CrISTATELLA MAGNIFICA, 1I-. s, 



Folypidom massive, fixed, encrusting bodies from a few inches to several feet 

 in length, by a few^ lines to 2 inches in diameter, gelatinoid, consistent, hyaline, 

 with numerous polypi upon the free surface arranged in close, irregular areolas. 



Pohjpi furnished with 2 lobes conjoined together in the form of U, enclosing 

 the mouth at the base, and having diverging from the margins from 50 to 80 sig- 

 moid tentaculae arranged at the summit in the double outline of U, with the ex- 

 tremities of the arms of the latter inclining towards each other. Lip elevate'', 

 with the base of the tentacular lobe, and the lower fourth of the inner margin oi 

 the tentaculae in the vicinity of the mouth, lake or dark rose-red colour ; oesopha- 

 gus colorless ; stomach longitudinally folded, yellowish brown; rectum dilatable, 

 hyaline, its extremity slightly projecting but retractile. 



Length from the bottom of the stomach to the top of the extended tentaculas li 

 lines. Long diameter of tentacular expanse h to 3-5th line. Length of tentaculae 

 l-40th in.; breadth 1-lOOOth in. 



Ovum lenticular, brown, enclosed at the margin by a brownish white, annular, 

 cellular sheath, l-200th in. deep upon one side, l-166th in. upon the other side, 

 furnished at its outer edge with 14 to 16 appendages l-200th in. long, terminating 

 in a double, rarely a triple booklet. Ovum with its sheath, thin, discoidal, bent, 

 l-33d in. broad, with its appendages enveloped in a hyaline, albuminoid mass ; 

 when ripe floating. 



Hahitation. Upon dead branches or twigs of trees, in ditches o'r sluggish 

 streams in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, in shaded situations. 



Remarks. The extent of this polyp appears to be determined by that of its 

 basement of attachment. It is usually found surrounding twigs or dead branches 

 of trees which have fallen into the water, and is permanently fixed to its position. 



The surface of the polyp mass has the appearance of being covered with a 

 dense mucor from the numerous tentaculas projecting from it. Immediately be- 

 neath this is a layer having a faint roseate hue from the red colouring in the 

 vicinity of the mouth of the polypi, then succeeds a layer of a dirty yellowish 

 color, arising from the stomach of the animals, beneath which are numerous 

 opaque, white, yellowish, and brown spots, which are ova in various stages of 

 development, and finally the greater depth of the mass consists of a perfectly hya- 

 line, consistent, gelatinoid substance. 




266 [Ski'tember, 



After the death of thp animals, and their bodies and tubes have macerated from 

 the surface of the Polypidom, their bases upon the areola of attachment have an 

 irregular stellate or lobate appearance, which penetrate in a convergent manner 

 to the nuclear twig or branch. The decaying mass has a strong odor in a re- 

 markable degree like that of putrid fish. 



The animal is not so irritable as Plumatella, but is like it capable of entirely 

 retracting within its tube, in which state the stomach appears transversely 

 wrinkled. 



The ova as they are detached from the mass rise near, or to the surface of the 

 water and float. 



There is probably some confusion existing in the distinction of the genera 

 Cristatella and Alcyonella, as characterized by Cuvier, Lamarck, Allman, 

 &c., but if correct then C. raagnitica would belong to a new genus between 

 Cristatella, Ciiv., and Alcyonella, Lam., for while the polyp and its ovum cor- 

 respond to the former, the polypidom corresponds to the latter. Should it prove 

 distinct I propose for it the name Pectinaiella. 



Dr. Leidy further stated as follows : 



The female Gordius which he had mentioned at the last evening, as 

 having extruded from September 25th up to that time a cord of ova 49 

 inches in length, had continued the process until Sunday evening, October 7th, up 

 to which time it had expelled in fragments from a few lines to one foot in length, 

 in all a cord 91 inches long, in which he estimated there were over 6,000,000 ova. 

 Dr. L. exhibited the cord of ova preserved in alcohol, which was long and white 

 and resembled a piece of cotton thread.

PAGURIDEA. 



The Paguridea include two groups, distinguished by peculiarities in the form of 

 the inner antenna, outer maxillipeds, and some other characteristics ; the one 

 agnatic in habit, and the other suhterrestrial. They are as follows : 



Fam. I. Pagurid.e. Inner antenuEc short, first joint very short. Palpus of 

 maxillipeds with a multlarticulate flagellum. Aquatic or littoral. 



Fam. II. Cexobitid.b. Inner antennae very long, the first joint of the base 

 as long as the eyes or longer, and bent obliquely downward. Palpus of outer 

 maxillipeds without a flagellum. Suhterrestrial. 



The Paguridre have hitherto been divided into but two genera ; Tagnrus, with 

 unsymcnetrical abdomen, and Cancellus, (Edvv.) with symmetrical. There 

 are, however, important characteristics, which point to a division into other 

 groups. These have been partly indicated by Milne Edwards, in the subdivi- 

 sions of the genus Pagurus, laid down in his work on Crustacea,* and more 

 distinctly in the Annales des Sciences Naturelles, for July, 1848. f In the latter 

 article there are discrepancies in certain instances, between the character of the 

 species and those mentioned for the subdivisions, which we find it difficult to 

 reconcile; such as the placing of P. tibicen, and some related species, with his 

 " jEquirnanes," when, in fact, the left hand is very much larger than the right, 

 and the guttat /IS zr\A granulattis with the " Senestres," although, in the former, 

 the hands are nearly equal, as in many of the " ^quimanes," and in the latter 

 the right hand (as is observed in his "Crustaces") is actually the larger. Yet his 

 sections are, in the main, natural groups, and some of them have more important 

 points of distinction than he has mentioned. 



"The Pagiiriis Bernhardiix is the type of one of these groups. Besides being 

 "dextres," they are peculiar in having acumijiate fngers,v/yt\\ the tips of those of 

 the larger hand calcareous ; and although the feet of the 4th pair are subcheliform, 

 like most other Paguridas, the scabrous area or rasp of the hand is confined nearly to 

 the posterior edge. Moreover, thespeciesbelongmainly to colder waters, while the 

 ordinary Paguri abound especially in the tropics. All the Paguri of England (or 

 with but one uncertain exception, recently pointed out,) are of the Bemhardus 

 type ; those of the Northwest coast of America are the same. We naturally, 

 therefore, distinguish this group as a genus under the name of Bernhardus. 



Among the remaining Paguri, the larger part have the feet of the 4th pair sub- 

 cheliform, the penult joint being broad, and the last (or tarsus) forming a finger 

 placed on its anterior margin. Yet, a few have these feet vergiform, the tarsus 

 being terminal ; and these species are also peculiar, in having two pairs of slen- 

 der appendages at the base of the abdomen, on account of which they are called 

 the " Pagures appendicules '' by Edwards. Besides, they have the flagellum of 

 the outer antennae more or less hairy, and often long ciliate along the under side, 

 and, also, the inner antennae have a longer base than usual, the 2d basal joint

reaching nearly, or quite, to the extremity of the eyes. These species make a 

 well characterized group, which we name Pagiirlstes, 



Another small group is singular in having a rostriform appendage to the 

 ophthalmic joint; they are the " Pagures armes " of Edwards, including P. 

 viiles and P. custos, the former the Canar Diogenes of Herbst. Besides this 

 distinction, the fingers of the hands are acuminated, as in the Bernhardi,and have 

 calcareous tips, although the species are not right-handed ; also, the 2d joint of the 

 outer antennas is complete on the upper side, and there is no moveable appendage 

 or acicle (a name we give to the so-called palpus, in allusion to its form). With 

 these distinctions, the group is entitled to the rank of a genus, which may be 

 named Diogenes. 



The remaining species of Pagurl are similar, in having the fingers of the hands 

 more or less spoon-shaped; with no rostriform appendage to the ophthalmic 

 segment between the eyes; the outer antennce bearing a moveable acicie; the 

 flafellum of the outer antennae naked ; the 2d joint of the base of the inner antennas 

 not reaching to extremity of eyes ; the feet of the 4th pair subcheliform with 

 the scabrous area on the hand, lateral and broad. 



The great majority of these have the tips of all the fingers corneous. But a 

 few have these tips in the larger hand calcareous, besides being peculiarly smooth 

 and neat in the appearance of the limbs, and naked, or nearly so, with the shell 

 more calcareous than usual. They have the left hand much the larger ; yet 

 unlike those species with corneous tips to the fingers that are strongly left- 

 handed, the front margin has a small salient point at middle. Of the species with 

 calcareous tips to the fingers, I make the genus Calcinus. This genus includes 

 the old species P. tihicen, Gaimardii, elegans, &c. 



The remaining species, still the larger part of the whole family, constitute the 

 genus Pagurus. The following is a synopsis of the subdivisions proposed.

The Committee to which was referred Dr. J. C. Fisher's description 

 of a new species of Cicada, with Mr. Cassin's Notes on the same and 

 on C. septendecim, reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings. 



On a 7ieto species of Cicada. 

 By J. C. Fisher, M. D. 



In the course of the observations made by the Committee of this Academy, to 

 which vi^as assigned the duty of investigating the habits and history of the seven- 

 teen year Locust, Cicada septendecim, which appeared during the present year 

 (1851) in the neighborhood of Philadelphia, the attention of its members was di- 

 rected by Mr. John Cassin to the fact, that two species had been confounded, and 

 that the insect regarded as the smaller variety was in fact a distinct species, a 

 conclusion at which he had arrived during their previous appearance in 1834. It 

 is much smaller, is blacker in color, especially on the lower surface of the abdo- 

 men, where also the segments are bordered more narrowly with yellow, and has 

 a note entirely different from that of the larger Cicada septendecim, Linn. Syst. 

 Nat. 1. pt. ii.p. 708, (1767.) 



The two species did not associate together, but were found mostly on separate 

 trees, the smaller being the less abundant. 



I propose on these grounds to characterize the smaller species as follows : 



Cicada Cassinii, nobis. J total length of body 9-lOths of an inch, of the wings 

 1 2-lOths inches ; ^ frequently smaller. 



Colors and general appearance much like those of Cicada septendecim, Linn., 




1851.] 



273 



but darker, and the segments of the abdomen below are more narrowly bordered 

 with yellow. Note different from that of C. septej^decim, and more like that of 

 some of the gras'shoppers. Inhabits the neighborhood of Philadelphia, appearing 

 in the winged or perfect state at intervals of seventeen years. 



Note on the above species of Cicada, and on the Cicada septendecim, Linn. 



By John Cassin. 



There are two distinct and easily recognized species of Cicada which appear at 

 intervals of seventeen years, and both of which were observed in this neighbor- 

 hood, especially in the woods at Powelton, during the present year. I saw them 

 in Delaware county, Pennsylvania, in 1834, and their entire specific distinctness 

 I have insisted on through good and evil report for the last seventeen years. 



It was, therefore, highly gratifying to me to have an opportunity of calling the 

 attention of the gentlemen of this Academy to the smaller species which Professor 

 Fisher has done me the honor of naming as above, and particularly to its note. 

 This is quite different from the prolonged and loud scream of the larger species, 

 (which is C. septendecim, Linn.) and begins with an introductory clip, clip, quite 

 peculiar. No disposition to associate with each other exists between the two 

 species, and although I have seen both on the same tree, yet most frequently they 

 were entirely separated, and occupied different parts of the woods. In 1834, I 

 observed the smaller species in localities which were somewhat favorably situa- 

 ted for moisture, but during the present year it occurred in localities as varied as 

 those of the other and larger species. At Powelton it was very abundant in an 

 orchard of apple trees on the most elevated part of the estate, and also on trees 

 in the adjacent woods. 



That the smaller species preferred low grounds was the observation of Dr. 

 Hildreth, of Marietta, Ohio, who, in an article on the Cicada septendecim, in Sil- 

 liman's Journal, xviii. p. 47, (1830) has the following paragraph : " There ap- 

 peared to be two varieties of the Cicada, one smaller than the other ; there was 

 also a striking difference in their notes. The smaller variety was more common 

 in the bottom lands and the larger in the hills." 



The size and the peculiar note are the most striking characters of the smaller 

 species, otherwise it much resembles the larger. The consideration of its claims 

 to specific distinction involves the general problem of specific character, which is 

 difficult in theory, but practically is readily solved. An animal which constantly 

 perpetuates its kind, or in other words reproduces itself either exactly or within 

 a demonstrable range of variation, is a species. These two Cicadce do not asson 

 ciate together as varieties commonly do. Of the very numerous instances in 

 which the phenomenon introductory to propagation has been observed this year, 

 in the course of the particular attention paid to these insects by gentlemen of this 

 Academy, not one case occurred in which the male and female of the two insects 

 were seen together. They are distinct species. 



The appearance of the Cicada sfptendecim in various localities at different 

 periods, each terminating intervals of seventeen years, for instance in Ohio in 

 1846 and in Eastern Pennsylvania in 1851, is a matter of remarkable interest. 

 Many independent ranges or provinces are known to exist in the United States, 

 and they are now ascertained to be so numerous that this species probably appears 




274 [September, 



in some part of the country every year. Assuming all that part of North America 

 in which it has ever been observed to be its zoological province, how are the 

 sub-provinces and different times of appearance to be accounted for ? Are all 

 those sub-provinces to be regarded as the theatres of independent creations ? Do 

 the facts demonstrate that the same species may exist in provinces which may be 

 presumed to have had different eras of origin ? 



It would be a curious fact, and one of important application, that exactly the 

 same species can inhabit provinces having independent creations, and if, too, as 

 in the case of this insect, it should be clearly impossible for it to have extended 

 from one province to another. 



Or, can it be possible that every distinct district in which the Cicada appear 

 is really an entomological province, and that entomological provinces in this part 

 of North America are quite restricted in extent, as has been observed by Dr. 

 LeConte in California ? (Communicated by that gentlemen to the American 

 Association for the advancement of Science at its meeting in August, 1851.) 



Those sub-provinces may have relations to geologic changes. Having the ex- 

 traordinary characteristic necessity of remaining in the earth for seventeen years, 

 as a fact in the history of this insect, may it be possible to infer that geologic 

 changes have effected the difference in the times of its appearance, or that so short 

 periods as fractions of seventeen years have been of geologic importance through- 

 out the range of the Cicadas? 



The Cicada sejjtendecim has appeared in the vicinity of Philadelphia, at inter- 

 vals of seventeen years, certainly since 1710. There has been, it aj)pears, no 

 variation of temperature, nor causes accidental nor other since that date sufficient 

 to affect its habits in any perceptible degree. It is stated in Clay's Svi^edish 

 Annals, to have appeared in May, 1715, in this neighborhood, (which, so far as I 

 know, is the earliest authentic record ;) punctually in the same month, every 

 seventeenth year, now certainly for nearly one hundred and fifty years, has this ex- 

 traordinary insect been known to make its visit. No causes have affected it 

 during that period, not even so far as relates to the month in which it appears. 



Passing, I would observe that so far as relates to the neighborhood of Philadel- 

 phia, the Cicada septe^idecim clearly had not a fair start with the year 1, anno 

 mundi of the commonly received chronology. If it had had, the sum produced by 

 1851-f--1004 1 ought to divide by 17 without a remainder, which it will not do, 

 more insignificant facts than which have troubled schoolmen. 



I have never seen any animals moie entirely stupid than the seventeen year 

 Locusts. They make no effort to escape, but allow themselves to be captured 

 with perfect passiveness, thus reminding one of the tameness of animals in coun- 

 tries where they are not molested by enemies. All animals of as high grade of 

 organization as these insects, acquire instincts from impressions made by the 

 presence of danger and otherwise, which they transmit to their offspring. The 

 young Fox of to-day is undoubtedly superior to his juvenile progenitor of a cen- 

 tury since. The cicada have acquired no such instinct. Their short life of matu- 

 rity above the surface of the earth, does not appear to be of sufficient duration for 

 such to be formed and impressed on their posterity. 



In short, it appears to me that the study of these insects, and the examination 

 of their separate ranges, might result in conclusions of extraordinary importance, 

 especially relative to modern views of the distribution of animals. No animal is

more easily traced. In other aspects, too, they present interesting points for 

 study, perhaps of general interest in zoological science. 



Dr. Zantzinger offered the following, which was adopted, 

 Resolved, That a member of the Society be appointed to prepare a 



new and extended "Notice cf the Academy," to be read before the 



Society, and designed for publication. 



The Chairman on motion being authorized to make the appointment, 



selected Dr. Ruschenberger, who accepted the same. 



ELECTION. 



The Rev. Lorenzo L. Longstreth, of Philadelphia, was elected a 

 Member of the Academy. 



October 1th. 

 Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



Dr. Leidy read a paper intetided for publication in the Proceedings, 

 entitled " Corrections and Additions to former papers on Helmintho- 

 logy published in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sci- 

 ences of Philadelphia," which was referred to Dr. Zantzinger, Dr. 

 Fisher, and Dr. Watson. 



A letter was read from the Secretary of the Geological Society of 

 London, dated May 1st, 1851, acknowledging the receipt of recent 

 numbers of the Proceedings. 



Dr. Leidy remarked, the members probably recollected that a few evenings 

 since he had mentioned, that it had been asserted by numerous and good authorities, 

 that Gordii had been observed within the body of insects. He now exhibited a 

 specimen of a Gordius and a grasshopper, preserved in a bottle of alcohol, which 

 had been sent to him by his friend Dr. Budd, of Pemberton, New Jersey. The 

 Gordius, Dr. Budd stated, was seen to come out of the body of the grasshopper, 

 and in a half an hour afterwards died. It is a different species from those de- 

 scribed a short time since. It is a female, about six inches long, by half a line in 

 length, rigid, strongly marked by transverse wrinkles, and annuli, with the caudal 

 extremity somewhat compressed and obtuse. To the species he gave the name 

 Gordius robustus. 



He also exhibited a species of Mermis from Brazil, belonging to the collection 

 of the Academy. It is fourteen and a half inches long, and of a reddish brown 

 color. To it he gave the name Mermis ferruginea.

which was referred to Dr. Wilson, Col. G. A. McCall, and Dr. 

 Watson. 



Mr. Charles Girard read a paper entitled < Historical Sketch of the 

 GordiacijE," which, being intended for publication, was referred to a 

 Committeee consisting of Dr. Leidy, Dr. Hallowell, and Dr. Horner. 



Dr. Fisher read a note from Dr. C. D. Meigs, announcing that he 

 was now prepared to read before the Society his biographical Memoir 

 of the late Dr. Morton. 



Professor Horner narrated a case illustrating the extreme lethargy 

 produced by the action of Carbonic acid gas on the human system. 

 The individual, while engaged in burning lime, had fallen asleep 

 durino- the night upon the edge of the kiln, and had been exposed to 

 the action of this gas for many successive hours. A great part of the 

 right fore arm, arm, scapula, and back had been severely burned, with- 

 out the knowledge of the patient, until he was extricated by persons 

 passing next morning. 



Dr. Leidy presented for the inspection of the members a mutilated cranium of 

 an extinct mammal, formerly characterized by him under the name of Oreodon 

 robustum.* It was one of five specimens of crania of the same species lately re- 

 ceived through Professor Baird from the Smithsonian Institute. When first ob- 

 tained, one side was completely enveloped within a matrix, upon the removal of 

 which the complete dentition of the animal was disclosed. The teeth form a 

 continuous arch as in Anoplotherium. The formula is m. s, p. m. 4, c. J, i.^ 



upon each side. 



Dr. L. also exhibited three inferior molars of the Rhinoceros occidentalis,t of 

 which the posterior measured seventeen lines antero-posteriorly, and ten lines 

 transversely ; the others about fourteen lines antero-posteriorly, and ten lines 

 transversely. 



Dr. Fisher offered the following, which was adopted. 



Resolved, That an invitation be sent by the Secretary, through the 

 Dean of each of the four Medical Colleges, of this city, to the students 

 attending lectures at the respective institutions, to visit the Museum of 

 the Academy on Tuesdays and Fridays, (public days,) and to inform 

 them that they will be admitted upon exhibiting their matriculation 

 tickets. 



Mr. Vaux offered the following, which was also adopted. 



Resolved, That the Committee appointed at a meeting of the 

 Academy, held May 16th, 1851, to select a Biographer of the late Dr. 

 Morton, be requested to obtain a suitable place for hearing the Memoir 

 by Dr. Meigs, and to make such other arrangements as may be 

 requisite.

Vice-President Bridges in the Chair. 



Mr. Lea read a paper on the genus Acoatma of D'Orbigny, a new 

 fresh water molkisc of the order Dhni/aria, from the river Guadua, 

 New Granada. 



Mr. Lea considers this shell as one of the most remarkable and interesting 

 which has ever come under his notice. The fact that it is in its young state a 

 free limusculose shell, and in its mature state an affixed ttniimtsculose shell, 

 places it among the anomalies which zoologists find it diffiult to understand, but 

 which, in this case, points out its true position in a natural arrangement. Mr. 

 Lea expressed his convictions that this shell, now so well described by M. 

 D'Orbigny, belonged to the same genus which Ferussac described in 1823, in the 

 Mem. of the Soc. Nat. Hist., Vol. 1, under the name of Mulleria, if it be not of 

 the same species, a single specimen (adult) of which had then only been seen. 

 Ferussac, considering the general resemblance of Mulleria to Ostrea, thought it 

 ought to be put alongside of, if not in, the latter genus. Brongniart and Latreille 

 thought it ought to go between Spo?idi/lics and Area. Other authors had assigned 

 it to various positions, while some doubted whether it was anything more than a 

 malformation. The perfect specimen, in its junior and adult state, if it be 

 Mulleria, now banish all difficulties. Mr. Lea thinks now, in placing Mulleria 

 (Acostaea) in its true position, at the head of the order Monomyaria, where it 

 makes the link with Diviyaria, it forms an easy transition from the first to the 

 second order. Thus retaining the trace of one while it passes so curiously into 

 the other. Nihil 2>er saltum, 



Mr. Lea, under the impression that D'Orbigny's Acostaa Guaduasana may 

 prove to be a distinct species from the shell described by Ferussac, under the 

 generic name of Mulleria, while it may belong to the same genus, proposes to 

 give the name of that distinguished zoologist to it. That of Guaduasana should be 

 retained of course for D'Orbigny's species. The genus would then represent 

 Mulleria Fertcssacii, and Mulleria Guaduasana. 



The paper being intended for publication in the Journal, was re- 

 ferred to Dr. Leidy, Dr. Ruschenberger, and Dr. Wilson. 



Dr. Fisher, on behalf of the Committee on the Memoir of Dr. 

 Morton, reported that they had selected the Hall of the University of 

 Pennsylvania, and had appointed the first Thursday in November as 

 the time for hearing the Memoir read by Dr. Meigs, provided the con- 

 sent of the Trustees of the University could be had, notice of which 

 would be given. 



On motion of Dr. Leidy, it was 



Resolvtd, That persons, not members of the Academy, vii\o may 

 contribute to the Museum or Library specimens of Natural History or 

 Books, deemed of sufficient value by the Curators or Librarian, be en- 

 titled to a ticket of admission to the Museum on public days, for a 

 period of six months. 




278 [October, 



Dr. Leidy exhibited three broken teeth, consisting of the body of a 

 canine and that of two posterior molars, which, he observed, were 

 fossils from Nebraska Territory, and belonged to an animal closely 

 allied to the genus Ursus. The tubercles upon the crown of the molars 

 are more elevated and conoidal than in the recent bears, and the 

 crown of the canine is relatively more robust. He proposed for the 

 animal the name of Arctodon. 



Dr. L. stated that he was preparing a memoir, in which would be 

 described in detail all the fossil remains of Mammalia from Nebraska 

 Territory, heretofore characterized by him in the Proceedings. 



He next presented for examination a species of fresh-water sponge 

 found growing in the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, in the vicinity 

 of Philadelphia, which he characterized as follows: 



Spongilla fragilis. Discoidal, lichenoid, growing in patches, flat, oval or 

 circular, lobate at the margin, translucent, yellowish-white or cream-colored. 

 Areolae distinct, subcircular. Reproductive bodies arranged in a single close 

 layer at the base of attachment of the sponge, shining, whitish-yellow, elevated 

 into a central papilla upon the upper surface. 



Measurements. From i to 2 inches in diameter by 1 to U lines in thickness 

 at the centre and gradually thinning off to the margin. 



Hahitatioii. Grows upon the under side of stones below low water mark in 

 the Rivers Delaware and Schuylkill. 



Siructtire. Compesed of an intertexture of spiculae about l-400th of an inch 

 long, having a minutely tubeiculated surface, over which is reflected a granulo- 

 cellular membrane. 



Remarl-s. After the death of the sponge, the areolated tissue macerates off, 

 leaving the reproductive bodies in a close layer attached to the rock. The living 

 sponge is never green, nor does it ever grow exposed to the light. 



Dr. L. further stated that another species of fresh-water sponge is not un- 

 common in our rivers, which grows exposed to the light, and is green in color 

 like the European Spongilla fluviatilis, but whether it is specifically distinct 

 from the latter, he has not yet ascertained.

Hislorical SlrtcA of Gordiacea-. 



Bt Charles Girard. 



I. 



There are groups, amongst the invertebrates of the animal kingdom, whose 

 natural history has made but little progress, although known to science for more 

 than half a century. 



The animals of which they are composed being generally of a diminutive size, 

 modest in form, modest in colors, have been looked at with indifference, thought 

 unworthy of a careful investigation, and deemed of too small an importance in a 

 general system of classification. 



Every living being, however, is entitled to occupy a rank in the creation ; 

 every one has its place, its aim, and its design. 



Yet some are called enigmatic, paradoxical, doubtful, as if to the Creator's 

 mind, any thing or any being could be either an enigma, a paradox, or a doubt. 

 Such groups, we must acknowledge, present great difficulties to investigators : 

 but let investigators be patient and laborious, and they will gradually sweep 

 away the enigmas, the paradoxes, and the doubts. 



When the researches on a group are slow, and embrace a long period, then it 

 becomes necessary, for the safe and future advancement of its natural history, to 

 recapitulate all the data in their chronology. These data will become a guide 

 into the various desiderata for new observations. 



Most diverse opinions are still entertained concerning Gordiaceae, and import- 

 ant zoological questions are still waiting the results of further investigations. 



Are Gordiaceae indigenous in America, or introduced from abroad ? If they are 

 indigenous amongst us, are they identical with, or specifically different from, the 

 European species ? 



Here commences a labor of comparison between the internal structure and 

 external appearance of specimens from both countries. Besides, specimens from 

 all the localities of one country should be compared, in order to ascertain the 

 number of species. Their embryology and metamorphosis must be traced; their 

 habits recorded, in order to enable us to assign a natural position to that family 

 in the class of worms. 



If they are introduced on this continent, how, where, and how long since, did 

 that event take place ? What is their geographical distribution and progressive 

 migration to the places where they are now found ? 



Some facts, which we already possess, and which are related hereafter, rather 

 enforce the belief of their aboriginal nature, than that of their introduction. Even 

 in the case of an identity between the Ameriean and European Gordiaceae, these 

 worms still deserve special attention from American anatomists, as the 

 latter might be successful in elucidating the controverted anatomical questions 

 which divide the naturalists of the old world. 



II. 



The genus Gordius was established by O. F. Miiller during the last century.* 

 Under that name were included aquatic worms, others living in moist grounds, 



* Vermium terrestrium et fluviatilium historia, 1773. 




280 [October, 



and still others, more numerous, found as parasites in the body of other animals. 

 Those which lead a permanent parasitical life, constitute now the genus Filaria, 

 of the same author,* which has been admitted by all subsequent naturalists, and 

 more than forty species of these are described by Rudolphi.t But there has been 

 a general belief, that the only difference between Gordius and Filaria consisted 

 in their habits, no zoological characters having as yet been detected. 



Lamarckf even says, that the species of Gordius were probably Filaria;; and if 

 he has kept those two genera, it was merely in accordance with a prevailing 

 practice. 



Cuvierll places Gordii at the end of the annelids, thus made to follow the 

 leeches, remarking, however, that they might perhaps come nearer the intestinal 

 worms. He was unacquainted with the fact, since ascertained, that several 

 Bpecies of true Gordius may be found, at a certain season of the year, within the 

 body of other animals. 



The genus Filaria is placed, by the same author, at the head of intestinal 

 worms. Its characters are derived from the external appearance, which, how- 

 ever, he (Cuvier) acknowledges, resembles closely that of Gordius. 



Should a generic difference hereafter be found between Gordius and Filaria, in 

 their anatomical structure, and we think it very likely to be the case, besides the 

 difference of embryonic development which already distinguishes them, we shall 

 have that peculiarity in their habits which makes Filaria to occur in such cavi- 

 ties of the body of other animals having no communication with the exterior, 

 whilst Gordii, when occasionally found within other animals, occur in the intes- 

 tinal canal ; that is to say, in a cavity which communicates directly with the 

 surrounding medium. This fact is of no small importance. 



The letter of Mr. Jacobson, to de Blainville, relates to Filaria, and not to 

 Gordius, as its title would lead any one to believe. 



Mr. Charvet,lT in describing two species of true Gordius, thinks that these 

 worms are indifferently external and internal, and that the distinction made be- 

 tween Filaria and Gordius becomes thus insignificant. Bot he is inclined to 

 believe that, if it can be proved that Filariae have a mouth provided with a suck- 

 ing apparatus, the character would be generic. He was not prepared, by direct 

 observations, to decide upon this fact. 



Leon Dufour** alludes to Gordii, and rejects the idea of an identity between 

 them and Filarias, considering the first as true Annelids, and the second as true 

 Entozoa ; there existing, he says, a mere external resemblance, which can only 

 be proved to depend on identity of structure by anatomical investigations.

Prof. Siebold* speaks of Filariac of various kinds of insects, resembling Gordii, 

 wiiich lived for some time in clear water, in which they had been placed. He 

 afterwards discovered the factf that sexes of Gordii were individutlised, and 

 males more numerous than females ; and, withdrawing Gordii from Entozoa, he 

 places them actually among Annelids. Subsequently! he makes of Gordii a sepa- 

 rate family, including also, the genus Mennis of Dujardin ; the family he calls 

 GoRDiACEyE, differing chiefly from that of Nematoidea in its embryonic develop- 

 ment. 



Entozoa have that peculiar mode of generation, in which several broods follow 

 each other, without resembling each other; nor will they resemble their parent 

 stock before the third, fourth, or fifth generation, according to the species. 



The young Gordiaceae resemble their parents as soon as hatched. There is, 

 however, not yet a single species of that family whose eggs have been made the 

 subject of a careful and complete study. Isolated facts only are known, and 

 to these we shall devote a few lines further on. 



There is a phenomenon, with which the naturalists of the old world are well 

 acquainted, which takes place during the existence of Gordiacese, (in Mermis as 

 well as in Gordius), it is the fact that they pass one part of their life within the 

 body of other animals, of Grasshoppers and Crickets, for example. They are 

 found in the clear running waters of the meadows and fountains, early in the 

 spring and summer ; they enter the body of grasshoppers in the fall, where they 

 deposit their eggs. These insects die, and their bodies afford to these eggs a 

 convenient shelter during the winter, when the next spring they will hatch, and 

 become free again. || Eggs, however, are sometimes found without any such 

 nidus; whether naturally or accidentally, remains to be ascertained. 



A. S. (Ersted agrees with Prof. Siebold in making of Gordiacese a separate 

 group amongst Nematoidea, on the ground of their embryonic development. 



Mr. DujardiniT is remarkably short, and adds nothing to our knowledge on 

 these worms, which he still calls enigmatic. 



The manner in which Mr. Emile Blanchard** has illustrated the anatomical 

 structure of the other families of the intestinal worms, would lead us to expect 

 from that ''observer, more precise facts respecting Gordiaceae, than those we had 

 before. But the author, at the outset, tells us that he was unable to fulfil the 

 task he had undertaken, that is, a complete history of that family. The want of 

 materials in such researches, added to the diflticulty of experimenting, are the 

 reasons advanced to account for the deficiency in this part of his investiga- 

 tions. The subject, therefore, stands precisely as it did before Mr. Blanchard 

 undertook his anatomical researches on the class of worms.

282 [October, 



The last European writer on this subject is Mr. Ed. Grube,* who has made 

 some observations on the development of the eggs of Gordins aq7iaticus, and 

 described a new species from Africa. His paper bears chiefly on minute para- 

 sitical nematoids. He also alludes to the great resemblance there is between 

 Mermis albicans and Ascaris acuminata. 



III. 



The anatomical structure of Gordiaceas is also a matter of much controversy 

 amongst anatomists. 



Prof Sieboldjf in giving an account of the difference between intestinal worms 

 and Gordii, again calls the latter enigmatic. 



Bertholdl describes a system of circulation, neither seen nor acknowledged by 

 the authors that came after him. He likewise mentions a nervous system ; but 

 giving no further account of it, its characters and distribution in the body of these 

 worms remain to be investigated. 



Dujardinll is in a complete doubt. 



Prof. Siebold, in resuming Berthold's and Dujardin's investigation, says that 

 the organs which Berthold took for veins and arteries, are contracted fibres, and 

 that he has failed of seeing any organs which he could confidently call nervous or 

 vascular systems. 



We do not know yet the digestive tube of any Gordiaceae. One fact, however, 

 is ascertained with regard to that organ: it atrophies in full grown indi- 

 viduals. Even the structure of the skin, or external envelope of the body, 

 deserves a more full coi iparative study. 



Although Charvet and Berthold agree in saying that Gordiaceas are androgynous, 

 it has been plainly ascertained since, that the sexes are distinct. But the struc- 

 ture of the sexual organs is not known. Prof. Siebold found an external charac- 

 ter by which males differ from the females, the former, in G. aqiiaticics, having 

 a bifurcated tail. 



IV. 



Some observations on the development of the eggs of Gordius aquaticus have 

 been made by Ed. Grube.lT Dr. Joseph Leidy had made similar investigations in 

 1846, and published only in 1850.** The eggs are laid in strings, nearly of the 

 length, and sometimes the color, of the worm itself. Within those whitish strings 

 or cords are found the eggs. The division of the yolk takes place, according to 

 the general law of division of that substance, previous to the formation of the 

 embryo. The embryo itself is gradually formed out of the yolk's substance, in a 

 manner similar to that in Clepsinae, and leeches in general. The young resemble 

 their parents as soon as hatched.

Young Gordii possess two circles of filamentary appendages around the pro- 

 boscis, which, at this early period, is alternately protruded and retracted. Whe- 

 ther the sanae motion, and the same appendages, are still present in the adult 

 state, is yet to be examined. Many worms are known to be provided with a retrac- 

 tile proboscis, which they use in perforating the sand and mud in which they 

 live. Gordii might require it to introduce themselves into the living bodies 

 where they are sometimes found. As to the circles of tentacles, they very likely 

 disappear in the adult, while the alimentary canal atrophies, their function being 

 intimately connected with the functions of the latter organ. 



V. 



With regard to the species of Gordiaceae to be admitted, naturalists do not any 

 more agree. 



The most common in Europe is Gordlus aquaticus, L.* The G. marinus and 

 G. aiinulatus of Montague,t are Nemerteae. 



Mr. Charvett describes two others, from the vicinity of Grenoble, (France,) 

 under two trivial names. 



Mr. Dujardinll considers as distinct, from the above, a species from the vicinity 

 of Toulouse, his Gordius Tolosanics. and describes another species, proposing for 

 it the genus Mermis, calling the species M. nigrescens. 



Prof. Siebold has made us acquainted with a second species of Mermis, his 

 M. albicans. 



Mr. BlanchardiT has described one species from Chili, under the name of G, 

 Chilensis. 



Finally, Mr. Ed. Grube** describes another from Africa, which he calls 

 Gordius crassus. 



Before we identify the North American Gordii with any of the above men- 

 tioned ones, we must be prepared to account for many objections which can be 

 made, respecting their having been created identical over such an extensive area, 

 or else of their having migrated naturally, or having been accidentally transported. 



VI. 



We have in the United States one species, which seems quite common in fresh 

 water, and referred by some to G. aquaticus. Rev. Z. Thompson, of Burling- 

 ton, (Vt.), expresses himself in the following terms : " The little animal called 

 the Hair snake also belongs to this order, (annulata,) and to the genus Gordius.

These are very common in the still waters, and mud, in all parts of the State. 

 They are usually about the size of a large horse hair, and are from one to six or 

 eight inches in length. In color they vary from pure white to nearlj' black, and 

 hence we probably have several species. The vulgar notion that they originate 

 from hairs which fall from horses and cattle, and become animated in the water, 

 would seem to be too absurd for contradiction ; and yet, absurd as it is, people 

 are to be found who believe it."* 



The same popular opinion is prevailing in Europe. Gordii have been noticed 

 in the body of insects, also, by an American entomologist, Dr. Th. Wm. Harris, 

 who says : " I have taken three or four of these animals out of the body of a 

 single locust."! 1'hey have been found, by others, within the cricket, {Acheta 

 ahbreviuta). 



We saw a specimen, six or seven inches in length, caught in the clear waters 

 in the vicinity of Richmond, (Va.) Several others were detected by Dr. Leidy 

 in the neighborhood of Philadelphia. 



Finally, we may mention several specimens of Gordii from Oregon, brought 

 home by the U. S. Exploring Expedition. 



Gordii, therefore, are spread all over the Western hemisphere.

Habitation. Parasitic within the intestine oi Stylaria fossularis. 



Remarks. From the translucency of ^the last mentioned worm, its parasite 

 may be seen within the intestine attached to the mucous membrane by means of 

 its posterior cordiform disk. While attached it alternately retracts its body with 

 a jerk, and then lengthens itself; in the former movement the posterior third of 

 the body becoming doubly intussuscepted, so as to have the appearance of a dou- 

 ble articulation. When detached the same movements take place, but in that of 

 retraction the cordiform disk is entirely drawn within the animal's body. More 

 details of this curious parasite I did not obtain, for, although I saw three, and 

 removed them from the intestine of the Stylaria, yet their movements were so 

 active I could not study them to advantage, and to quiet them I tried a minute 

 portion f the vapour of chloroform, which instantly killed them, but at the same 

 moment they underwent total destruction. Since then I have not been able to 

 examine others.

- Mr. Lea announced the death of Richard Cowling Taylor, which 

 took place on Sunday morning, the 2Gth inst., at his residence in 13th 

 street, in his 62d year, after a very short ilhiess. 



Mr. Lea remarked, that it was very rarely that the members of the Academy 

 had to deplore so severe a loss, as that sustained by the death of their distin- 

 guished fellow member Mr. Taylor. 



In his particular branch of Geology (economic-geology) he stood pre-eminent, 

 and as a mining engineer, no authority in this country, or, perhaps, in Europe, 

 was superior to that of Mr. Taylor. By early education and association in Eng- 

 land, he became versed, in the most thorough manner, in these important sciences 

 at an age when such education usually begins. Hence, his first literary produc- 

 tions brought him prominently before the learned world, and he was introduced 

 into literary and scientific societies, where he took an active part. The first 

 work of importance which he published, was one on the Monastic remains of the 

 county in which his father lived as a country gentleman, and on whose property 

 there was a noted Anglo-Norman ruin. It was this probably that induced Mr. 

 Taylor first to turn his attention to this branch of knowledge, and the result was 

 the " Index Monasticus, in the ancient kingdom of East Anglia," published in 1821, 

 in 1 vol. folio,* which at once gave him a reputation for thorough investigation 

 and exactness, which noted all his after works, and which has rarely been excel- 

 led. This work was received with so much favor, that Mr. Taylor was induced, 

 at the request of the publishers, to undertake that thorough and learned work 

 which he called a " General Index to Dougdale's Monasticon Anglicanum," in 

 1 vol. folio, with plates and maps, which was published in 1830. This took Mr. 

 Taylor two years to complete, and was said to be so perfect as to require nothing 

 further to be added in regard to it. In his profession, he had the great advantage 

 of a most thorough and complete education, and he was associated in business with 

 the late Wm. Smith, who has been considered as " the father of British Geology,'> 

 on account of his having been the first geologist in England who attempted to 

 classify the rocks^of that country, by their characteristic fossils ; and who was said 



At a public sale his private copy, with some notes, brought 30. 




1851.] 291 



to have preceded MM. Cuvier and Brongniart in that important step, which gave 

 such an impulse to this great branch of human knowledge. Under such auspices^ 

 and by his assiduous application, Mr. Taylor made the most rapid advances in 

 the art of Mining and the science of Geology. The early relations of this inter- 

 course ripened into a friendship, and sincere mutual regard, which lasted through 

 life. 



With such acquirements, he was soon called into active employment, and we 

 find him engaged, for a time, in the important ordinance survey of England, and 

 he was also employed by the " British Iron Company," whose extensive and 

 valuable property in South Wales, he investigated and reported upon. That 

 portion of the Ordinance Survey which he executed, was finished in a most mas- 

 terly manner, and his drafts were of the most exact and perfect kind. His report 

 of the topography and geology of the mineral lands of the British Iron Company, 

 were so admirably executed, that the Geological Society of London published the 

 map and descriptive parts in its Transactions. In connection with this, he exe- 

 cuted a model in plaster of that part of Wales,* which received so much ap- 

 probation, that the Society of Arts awarded to him their gold Isis Medal, 

 which is now in possession of his family. Subsequently to this, he was engaged 

 for some years, in England, in the examination of various mining properties, 

 after which he was induced to accept an appointment byHardman Phillips. Esq., 

 an intimate friend of the family, to remove to this country, and reside in Phillips- 

 burg, Pennsylvania, where he remained four years, under the expectation of 

 the professional employment promised him there. This was an unfortunate 

 movement for himself and family, which now consisted of a wife and four daugh- 

 ters. Having lost, in this residence, both time and money, he removed 

 to Philadelphia, for the purpose of seeking that employment in his profession, 

 in which he was so well qualified to excel. Previous to this, however, he was 

 engaged in the survey of the Bossburgh District, and the line of railroad, which 

 he completed, and made an extensive and able report in 1832. 



It was after this time, in 1834, Mr. Lea first became personally acquainted 

 with Mr. Taylor, which acquaintance immediately grew into a friendship, which 

 increased through life. Shortly after this, Mr. Lea had it in his power to have 

 Mr. Taylor placed in charge of the exploration of the extensive coal and iron 

 property of the Dauphin and Susquehanna Coal Co., in Dauphin county, Pa., in 

 which Mr. Lea had a large interest. Here Mr. Taylor remained about three 

 years, and developed the mineral resources of this extensive mineral district, to 

 the entire satisfaction of the Board of Directors. The whole of the lands 

 embraced 42,000 acres, in a rugged, mountainous district, which required an 

 experience and perseverance which few men had more of than Mr. Taylor. The 

 result of this great labor was an elaborate report, of 187 pages in 8vo., together 

 with about 150 maps, drafts, surveys and sections, which are invaluable to the 

 Company, and in whose possession they now are. In connexion with this, during 

 a period of cessation, in this country, of activity in such works, he employed 

 himself in the execytion of a model of this part of the coal basin and its sur- 

 rounding mountains, which occupied him many months. This subsequently 

 became the property of the Dauphin Company. It embraces in length about 45 



*This was the first model of the kind executed in England. 




292 [October, 



miles, and in breadth 15 miles of the district it represents, and is about 14 feet 

 long. It is a complete geological and topographical representation of this import- 

 ant district, and would be alone a monument to a man of science, if he had never 

 executed any other labor. 



As soon as the mining interests of the country had become relieved from the 

 pressure which had prevailed for a few years, he again was called on to explore 

 and investigate many mineral districts, connected with the working of gold, silver, 

 lead, copper, coal, asphaltum, &c. Most of these reports were published, and it 

 is believed that, in every case, they were so correctly executed as to leave no 

 doubt in the minds of those who employed him, as to his judgment, his candor 

 and his scrupulous representations of that which he was employed to examine. 

 It was one of the characteristics of Mr. Taylor, as all his intimate friends were 

 perfectly aware, that his openness and frankness were such as to induce him 

 never to hesitate to express a candid opinion, or to make known a fact, however 

 much it might be against his own interests. It was this which induced the most 

 unbounded reliance, among his friends, on his representations. Beside the numer- 

 ous engagements he had in various States, he frequently had calls to examine 

 important mines in other parts of America; the copper mines of Cuba, the gold 

 mines of Panama, the asphaltum of New Brunswick, &c. In Cuba he was employed 

 to examine and report on the vein of asphaltum near Havana, of which he pub- 

 lished an account in the Trans, of the Am. Phil. Soc, with a plan and section* 

 The last work of this nature he was engaged in, was the examination of the injected 

 vein of asphaltum at Hillsborough, in the Province of New Brunswick, which is 

 now in litigation. His testimony in this case, as taken down, and since published, 

 is a specimen of such thorough knowledge in his profession, such clearness, exact- 

 ness and completeness, as to be worthy of all praise. It should have a place in 

 all geological libraries. He was greatly interested ia this singular litigation, 

 which seems, strange as it may appear to geologists and mineralogists, to depend 

 on the decision of a jury, whether an injected vein of asphaltum be not a seam 

 or bed of bituminous coal, belonging to true coal measures! Nothing could be 

 more clear, nor more to the point, than Mr. Taylor's evidence to the contrary. 

 While in the examination of various districts, in his professional employment, he 

 carefully noted every fact connected with general geology and palaeontology, and 

 the results were generally given in the form of papers to scientific bodies, and 

 published in their Transactions. These will be found in various learned transac- 

 tions in England and this country particularly in those of the Am. Phil. Soc. 

 the Acad, of Nat. Sciences, and the Geological Soc. of Penn., on this side of the 

 Atlantic. They all bear internal evidence of a philosophic mind, schooled in the 

 consideration of philosophical facts. 



Notwithstanding what has been said in regard to all these labors of a most 

 industrious life, the reputation of Mr. Taylor will rest chiefly on a work which 

 has not yet been mentioned his " Statistics of Coal," published in this city, in 

 8vo. pp. 754, in 1848. It included the geographical and geological distribution 

 of mineral combustibles or fossil fuel, as well as notices of localities of the various 

 mineral bituminous substances employed in arts and manufactures, illustrated by , 

 maps and diagrams, embracing, from official reports of the great coal producing 

 countries, the respective amounts of their production, consumption, and commer- 

 cial distribution, in all parts of the world. 




1851.] 293 



The execution of this work had engaged Mr. Taylor's time, not necessarily- 

 devoted to the practice of his profession, during many years of his life. His 

 heart was set upon the completion of it, and when approaching to a con- 

 clusion it drew his mind from all other pursuits. While it was going through 

 the press, he became so ill that, for many weeks, his physician and his family 

 had little expectation of his living to see it completed. During this period many 

 of the sheets had to pass through the press without his inspection, which fact 

 naturally produced some errors. When the work reached the hands of those 

 interested in the statistics of coal, its geology, and its geographical distribution, 

 it was received with the most entire satisi'action. His intimate friends were the 

 first to congratulate him on the work he had achieved, and the criticisms of the 

 press soon followed with their share of approbation. Dr. Fitton, the distinguished 

 geologist, reviewed it in the Edinburgh Review, and gave o its author the credit 

 he so well deserved, of which the following is a single paragraph. 



" The inquiries of the author have been extended, with marvellous industry 

 and perseverance, to every part of the globe ; but, as might be expected of an 

 engineer residing in America, the coal tracts of that countr)- naturally occupy a 

 large portion of the work. As these are probably less known, to most of our 

 readers, than the coal producing states of Europe, while they are beyond all com- 

 parison the greatest depositories of coal in the world affording to that fortunate 

 region the prospect of almost unbounded wealth we shall confine our attention 

 chiefly to this part of the work. But our readers may be assured that the author's 

 account of other countries gives equal proofs of his diligence in collecting 

 information." 



The hondon, Ediiihurgh and Dublin Phil. Mag, and Jour, of Science, in its 

 notice of this work, says, " comprehensive as the title of this work appears, it 

 does not yet convey a just idea of its scope, or the extent of the subject matter. 

 Did its title stand, ' Coal the civilizer ; its natural history, productions and appli- 

 cations,' it would perhaps convey to the casual reader a more just idea of the 

 object and contents of the work." * * * "A long and intimate practical 

 acquaintance with mines and mining operations in different parts of the world, 

 had necessarily led him to amass a great quantity of material ; the value of which, 

 as a constant object of reference for his own use, led him to feel the utility of a 

 digested and methodized arrangement of those materials, in a permanent shape, 

 for the use of others. But there is found, throughout these pages, a pervading 

 spirit beyond that merely materialistic and dry one, which the title would indicate, 

 and which the professional engagements of the author might have led us to anti- 

 cipate. We perceive, impressed on every section, the idea, 7iot of coal the mere 

 wealth producer, the mere material instrument of the human animal, but of coal as 

 an important agent in promoting civilization. It is in the same spirit, and imbued 

 with the same everywhere pervading high moral sentiment, that the author more 

 than once calls attention to the vastly greater importance of iron than of gold and 

 silver. We cannot conclude without cordially recommending this work to the 

 attention of our readers. While it will be an invaluable book of reference to 

 every future inquirer into the numerous economic questions connected with our 

 most important industrial operations, and manufactures, and into the great social 

 questions arising out of them, it will form an indispensable part of the library of 

 every geologist."

294 [October, 



The Loyidon AihencBum in its notice says, "The work of Mr. Taylor will 

 command attention, and become standard as a reference ; especially as it is the 

 only one which endeavors to concentrate the knowledge diffused through so 

 many channels, and often attainable only in the countries to which the statistics 

 refer." 



The press in this country did not withhold its proper appreciation of a work 

 so important to the great coal and iron interests this side the Atlantis. 



In the notice in Silliman's Journal it is said, "It is a sufficient guarantee for its 

 completeness and accuracy on all points on which it touches, that it received, 

 before publication, the highest and most unqualified praise at one of the meetings 

 of the American Association of Geologists and Naturalists." * * * "An 

 examination of the volume, now that it has appeared from the press, gives us a 

 still higher opinion of the talents and industry of its author, and the great value 

 of his labors," &c. The Journal of the Franklin Institute stated it could scarcely 

 have been thought possible that one individual, especially in this country, could 

 have collected together such a mass of facts, and made of them so well arranged 

 and so delightful a book. Hunt's Merchants' Magazine says, " We venture to 

 say that, on no kindred subject, has a more complete or perfect treatise ever been 

 produced." 



Beside the proficiency which Mr. Taylor had acquired in economic geology, he 

 had devoted himself much to theoretic geology, and his knowledge of the various 

 formations, which make the sum of the geological series, was rarely excelled by 

 his colleagues. He had devoted himself more particularly to the strata connected 

 with the coal formation, and he was the first person, as Prof. Silliman stated to 

 a meeting of the American Association of Geologists, who had referred the Old 

 Red Sandstone, underlying the coal of this State, to its true position, correspond- 

 ing with its place in the series of European rocks. He was unwilling to engage 

 in State surveys, but his aid was sometimes required to assist in those particular 

 branches in which he so much excelled. With this view he for a short time lent 

 his services to the New York State Survey. 



In the year 1832 he was elected a member of this Academy, and in 1846 a life 

 membership was conferred upon him, " as a mark of respect and a just apprecia- 

 tion of its means of usefulness derived from him." His attachment to the 

 Academy increased with his advancing years. He frequently made donations to 

 it of specimens and books. Very recently, he presented a most elaborate geolo- 

 gical table in manuscript, colored to represent the different strata, and combining 

 the analogous nomenclature of various systems. This most valuable donation 

 was made to the Academy on condition of its never being taken from the library, 

 and it cannot fail to be most useful for consultation and reference. 



At the time of his death, Mr. Taylor was engaged in preparing a paper, for the 

 Journal of the Academy, on the fossil plants which he had discovered in his 

 recent visit to New Brunswick. The fossil fishes which he also discovered there, 

 he left with his friend Prof. Agassiz, who was to describe the new ones for him. 

 All these Mr. Taylor intended should be deposited in the collection of this 

 Academy, to which ho had already added many valuable specimens. 



Mr. Taylor was the third son of Samuel Taylor, of New Buckenham, in Nor- 

 folk, England, and a descendant of Dr. John Taylor, the author of the Hebrew 

 Concordance. He was born at Banham, in Norfolk, Jan. ISth, 1789. His bro-

thers and cousins were men generally distlngnished by their great literary and 

 scientific acquirements. His younger brother, Edgar Taylor, was a distinguished 

 member of the legal profession in London, and an accomplished scholar. He was 

 the author of several works, and remarkable for his numerous learned reviews, 

 published in the most prominent periodicals in Great Britain. His cousm, 

 Richard Taylor, is the well-known and able editor of the Philoiophical Magazine, 

 which has been the leading scientific Journal of England for the last 25 years. 

 John and Phillip were equally distinguished as raining engineers. 



The great services Mr. Taylor had rendered science, have been acknowledged, 

 by his being made a member of the principal Societies in England and this 

 country, which embraced those branches of knowledge which he cultivated. He 

 was elected a member of the Geological Society of London, and of the Society 

 of Civil Engineers, of that city. In this country he was a member of this 

 Academy, as before mentioned; of the American Philosophical Society ; of the 

 Geological Society of Pennsylvania ; of the American Association of Geologists 

 and Naturalists, of the Franklin Institute, &c. &c. 



In a rapid survey of Mr. Taylor's scientific labors, it would be difficult to give 

 any thing more than a brief and imperfect list of his writings. In this sketch 

 will not be introduced his professional reports, which occupied the chief part of his 

 life, and which were generally executed in such a systematic and perfect manner, 

 as to remain models, worthy of imitation by all engaged in such works. Whether 

 his beautiful map of the Ordinance Survey, executed in 1813 14, was the first, 

 is not certain, but it seems to bear the earliest date. He subsequently published, 

 in the Trans. Geological Society of London, " Notice of two Models and Sections 

 of about eleven square miles, forming a part of the Mineral Basinof South Wales, 

 in the vicinity of Pontypool," (1830.) " On the Crag Strata at Bramerton, near 

 Norwich," (1823). "On the Alluvial Strata, and on the Chalk of Norfolk and 

 Sufl^olk, and on the Fossils by which they are accompanied," (1823). la the 

 Magazine of Natural History he published, in 1829, a paper called the "Progress 

 of Geology," which was followed, in 1830, by another, the " Introduction to 

 Geology," which was succeeded by " Illustrations of Antedeluvian Zoology and 

 Botany." These papers were illustrated with many beautiful drawings and sec- 

 tions, and were published before he came to America. His first papers published 

 in this country were, it is believed, in the Trans, of the Geological Society of 

 Pennsylvania, with the following titles': " On the Geological position of certain 

 beds, which contain numerous Fossil Marine Plants of the family Fucoides, near 

 Lewistown, Mifflin county. Pa.," (1831). "On the relative position of the 

 Transition and Secondary Coal Formations in Pennsylvania, and description of 

 some transition or Bituminous, Anthracite, and Iron ore beds, near Broad Top 

 Mountain, in Bedford county, and of a coal vein in Perry county, Pennsylvania, 

 with sections." " Notices of the evidences of the existence of an ancient Lake, 

 which appears to have formerly filled the Limestone Valley of Kishacoquillas, in 

 Mifflin county, Penna." " On the Mineral Basin or Coal Field of Blossburg, on 

 the Tioga River, Tioga county, Penn." "Memoir of a section passing through 

 the Bituminous Coal Field near Richmond, in Virginia." "Review of the Geo- 

 logieal phenomena, and the deductions derivable therefrom, in 250 miles of sec- 

 tions, in parts of Virginia and Maryland. Also, notice of certain Fossil Acoty 




296 [October, 



ledonous Plants in the secondary strata of Fredericksburg," (Vir.) In the 

 Transactions of the American Philosophical Society he published " Memoir of the 

 Character and Prospects of the Copper Region of Gibara, and a Sketch of the 

 Geology of the N. E. part of the Island of Cuba." " Notice of Fossil Arborescent 

 Ferns of the family Silliquaria and other Coal Plants, exhibited in the Roof and 

 Floor of a Coal Seam in Dauphin county, Penn." "Notice of a Vein of Bitu- 

 minous Coal recently explored in the vicinity of the Havana, in the Island of 

 Cuba." (This was jointly with Mr. Clemson). In Silliman's Journal he pub- 

 lished, ' Notes respecting certain Indian Mounds and Earthworks in the form of 

 Animal Effigies, chiefly in the Wisconsin Territory, U. S,, with Plans and Illus- 

 trations." "Notice of a Model of the Western portion of the Schuylkill, or 

 Southern Coal Field of Penn., in illustration of an Address to the Association of 

 American Geologists, on the most appropriate modes for representing Geological 

 Phenomena," (with illustrative sections). In the Journal and Proceedings of the 

 Acad. Nat. Sciences, "Table constructed from a few Meteorological Notes, 

 chiefly in regard to the daily temperature of noon, on the East Coast of the Isth- 

 mus of Panama, Port Royal, in Jamaica, and on the return voyage to New York, 

 for the month of October, 1849." " Substance of Notes made during a Geologi- 

 cal Reconnoisance in the Auriferous Porphyry region next the Carribean sea, in 

 the Province of Veraguas and Isthmus of Panama," 1851, with maps. At the 

 time of his suddeh illness he was engaged in a paper entitled, On a Vein of 

 Asphaltum of Hillsborough, in Albert county. Province of New Brunswick," 

 which he has left in an unfinished state, but which is so far complete as to justify 

 its publication in the Journal of the Academy.

Letters were read : 



From Isaac Chipman, Esq., dated Acadie College, October 3d, 1851, 

 ackuowledging the receipt of his notice of election as a Correspondent, 

 and announcing that he had transmitted a box of minerals from his 

 vicinity for the Academy. 



From the Librarian of the British Museum, dated October 7th, 1851, 

 acknowledging the receipt of No. 9, Vol. 5, of the Proceedings. 



From Mr. William H. Towson, of Philadelphia, stating that the col- 

 lection of minerals belonging to the late Dr. William Grambcl, was for 

 sale. Referred to the Mineralogical Committee. 



Dr. Leidy observed that he had examined the fossil saurian bones, consisting of 

 two teeth, two vertebrae, a fragment of a rib and an ungual phalanx, presented to 

 the Academy October 21st, by Mr. Robert H. Nash, who obtained them from the 

 Miocene formation of Westmoreland county, Virginia. Dr. Leidy found them to 

 belong to a new extinct species of Crocodile, for which he proposed the name of 

 Crocodilus antiquus. 



Mr. Theodore F. Moss read some remarks on the Geology of Texas. 



Dr. Fisher announced that the Trustees of the University of Pennsyl- 

 vania had granted the use of the College Hall to the Academy, for the 

 purpose of hearing the Memoir of the late Dr. Morton read by Dr. 

 Meigs.

 L. Le Conte, M. D.," which was referred to a Committee consisting of 

 Dr. Leidy, Dr. Hallowell, and Mr. Haldeman. 



Dr. Le Conte read a second paper, also intended for publication in the 

 Proceedings, entitled " Zoological Notes," which was likewise referred to 

 the above Committee. 



A letter was read from Mr. Alexander Vattemare, dated Paris, Octo- 

 ber 19th, 1851, announcing that he had addressed to the Academy a 

 box, containing three crania, procured from the Museum of Natural His- 

 tory of Paris, at the request of the late Dr. Morton, and calling the at- 

 tention of the Academy to the importance of a universal system of inter- 

 national exchanges between scientific institutions. 



Letters were also read : 



From the Trustees of the New York State Library, dated Albany, 

 November Sd, 1851, acknowledging the receipt of No. 10, Vol. 5, of the 

 Proceedings.

November 5th, 1851, requesting certain numbers of the Proceedings of 

 the Academy necessary to complete the series in the Library of that 

 Institution. 



From Dr. J. L. Burtt, U. S. N., dated U. S. Naval Hospital, New 

 York, November 8th, 1851, acknowledging the receipt of his notice of 

 election as a Member. 



Dr. Leidy presented a list of minerals offered by the Bavarian Govern- 

 ment, and also a list of minerals of this country desired by the same 

 in exchange. Referred to the Mineralogical Committee. 



Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to some fossil bones from the 

 Miocene formation of Virginia, which he characterized as having belonged to two 

 species of Whale, as follows : 



Bai.aena pal^atlantica, Leidy. This species is proposed upon a fragment 

 of a lower jaw, a dorsal vertebra, and the zygomatic portion of the temporal bone. 

 The specimens were discovered by Dr. R. Eppes in Virginia, and presented to 

 Prof. W. E. Horner, to whom they belong. They were found in association with 

 Pecten Jeffersonius, Venus tridacrioides, etc. The fragment of lower jaw, 8i 

 inches long, is stout in its proportions, is relatively straight, with no tendency 

 to curve downwards. In section it is vertically ellipsoid, but becomes more 

 cylindroid anteriorly. Internally it is convex, externally demicylindroid. The 

 upper margin is elevated, obtuse, and irregular. Just within it, in the specimen, 

 situated about two inches apart, are three gingeval foramina, about four lines in 

 diameter, and slightly oblique forwards in their direction. External to the up- 

 per margin at the anterior half of the specimen, about one inch apart, are two 

 large labial foramina, one four lines, the other five ^lines in diameter, directed 

 very obliquely forward. 



Measurements of the fragment.

Vertical diameter, 4Hnches, 3| inches.

The dorsal vertebra indicates an adult animal. Its articular faces are flat and 

 compressed circular. The transverse processes and neural arch are broken 

 away.

Balaena prisca, Leidy. This species is proposed upon a fragment of a lower 

 jaw and a caudal vertebra, found in association with Crocodilus antiquus, Pecten 

 Jeffersonius, &c., in Westmoreland county, Virginia. The specimens were ob- 

 tained by Mr. Robert H. Nash, and presented by him to the Academy. 



The fragment of lower jaw, fourteen inches long, is of much more slender pro- 




1851.] 309 



portions than that of the preceding, it is also more uniform in its breadth and 

 depth, and has a stron^i curve downards as in B. rorqual, Lac. It is very nearly- 

 flat internally and demi-cylindrical externally. The upper margin is angular but 

 not prominent, and forms the boundary between the inner and outer side. The 

 gingeval foramina, five in number in the specimen, are placed below the upper 

 margin internally, are about one line in diameter, and open very obliquely for- 

 ward into grooves almost horizontal, from half an inch to one inch long. The 

 labial foramina of which there are the remains of seven in the specimen, are 

 about half an inch external to the upper margin, are about two lines in diameter, 

 and open very obliquely forward. 



Measurementf! of the fragment.

The caudal vertebra found associated with the above fragment, and which I 

 suppose to belong to the same animal, is adult, and indicates a larger species 

 than the B. palaeatlantica, for it is as large as the dorsal vertebra of the latter. 

 Its articular faces are subcircular, and are moderately convex. The transverse 

 processes and neural arch are broken away in the specimen, as is also the case 

 with the abutments of the chevron bone. The transverse processes have their 

 origin 11 inches posterior to the anterior articular face.

Dr. Fisher, on behalf of the Committee on the Memoir of Dr. Morton, 

 announced that it had been read by Dr. Meigs on Thursday evening last, 

 November 6th, 1851, at the Hall of the University of Pennsylvania. 



Whereupon the following resolutions were offered, and unanimously 

 adopted : 



Resolved^ That the sincere thanks of this Society are due, and are 

 hereby presented to Dr. Charles D. Meigs, for his able and highly ap- 

 propriate Memoir of its late President, Dr. Samuel George Morton, read 

 before the Society on the 6th inst., at the Hall of the University of 

 Pennsylvania. 



Resolved, That the Memoir be published, and that the Committee on 

 Proceedings have charge of the same.

Zoological Notes. 

 By John L. Le Conte, M. D. 



During a visit to Panama, in December, 1849, 1 had frequent occasion to observe 

 many animals of such frail texture, as to render impossible any attempt to pre- 

 serve them, and took many notes respecting their appearance and habits. By an 




1851.] 317 



accident, my manuscript while oeing sent j-iome, was rendered nearly illegible, 

 and I am now able to recover only a few fragments of it. 1 have thought that 

 the animals observed, were of suflicient importance to warrant the publication of 

 my notes, although not relating to the subjects of my own special researches. 



I had intended to prefix a few observations respecting the geographical distri- 

 bution of organic beings on the Isthmus, but having recently received through 

 the kindness of friends, collections which serve to make a more minute compari- 

 son between the production of different parts of the year, I will postpone for the 

 present, the discussion of the phenomena observed, and merely state a single fact 

 which appears to me of great importance, in considerations regarding the limit of 

 the effects of physical causes. During the month of December, I labored assidu- 

 ously to procure a set of the Coleoptera of the vicinity of Panama, and was sur- 

 prised on looking over my collection, to find a complete absence of the genera 

 known to be confined to the tropics. In fact, with the exception of half a dozen 

 Chrysomelines, there was not a single species which might not have come from a 

 region far north of the tropic. It is known that in the southern part of the 

 temperate zone, the Carabica, Brachelytra, water beetles, &c., which first appear 

 in the spring at northern localities, are most abundant in winter, and this would 

 be naturally explained by the fact that the temperature in that season is most 

 nearly akin to to that of the regions in which they flourish best. But it is a little 

 alarming for the doctrine of physical causes, to find that the same arrangement in 

 the appearance of species, is kept up in a region where climate can have nothing 

 to do in producing these phenomena.

Color grayish yellow ; disc brown with closely approximated pale spots ; arms 

 seven times as long as the diameter of the disc, with every fourth dorsal plate 

 dark ; the scales of the disc are very small and imbricated, the radial ones 

 scarcely larger, and widely separated. The oral plates are rounded on the lateral 

 angles, and are not surrounded with papillas ; but from the apex of each, run two 

 rows of small papillae, which follow the inflexed margin of the fleshy part of the 

 disc. The oral papillae are distinct, four on each side. The tentacular pores have 

 each two small scales, the spines are arranged in three rows, their length is equal 

 to the diameter of the arms. This species apparently resembles 0. reticulata 

 MuUer, 95. Oi^lmira reticulata Say (J. Ac. 5, 148,) but the spines are longer.

 there are only three on each side : the tentacular pores have two small oblong 

 scales: the spines are in three rows, and their length is only one half the diameter 

 of the arms: the spines of the middle row are rough. This species seems very 

 similar to O. elongata Mul. 95. Ophiura elong. Say J. Ac. 5, 116.

Pale beneath, above blackish brown ; arms marked with a few paler bands ; 

 the scales are all finely granulated, the radial ones separated by two plates. The 

 oral plates are not surrounded with papillae, and on each side there is only a sin- 

 gle oral papilla; the tentacular pores are protected with single scales, the second 

 scale being spiniform and forming the lowest of the five series of lateral spines, 

 the longest of which is scarcely equal to the diameter of the arms.

Only a single specimen found very distinct by the hispid surface of the disc. 

 The oral plates have on each side 3 or 4 tolerably large papillas. The tentacular 

 pores have two small elliptical scales. 



Besides the species described above, a large one was given me by Dr. Duchas- 

 saing, which strongly resembles O. serpentaria, from the West Indies. The dor- 

 sal plates of the arms were a little more transverse, and the buccal plates more 

 rounded. Not having had sufficient opportunity for examining whether these 

 should be considered as specific differences, I forbear for the present expressing 

 an opinion on this specimen.

 This species is very variable as regards the closeness of the numerous short

serrate spiculae which clothe the disc; the radial plates are more or less distinct, 

 sometimes nearly free from spiculae ; they are large and granulate, the angle which 

 is above the base of the arm nearly touches the corresponding angle of the next 

 plate, and is whitish. The oral plates are wider than long, with the oral angle 

 distinct and the lateral angles rounded; the apex is acuminate. The inner series 

 of plates bounding the oral plates is very narrow. The brachial spines are ar- 

 ranged in 7 rows, the two inferior ones being the shortest ; the others are about 

 twice as long as the diameter of the arm, and serrate from base to tip ; they are 

 transparent, with the apex frequently black. The body is dark fuscous above, 

 and pale beneath ; every fifth ventral plate on the arms is sometimes red or 

 brown. 



Some of the varieties of this species may possibly be Ophiothrix ciliaris Mul. ; 

 the young are pale colored, and very like the adults ; the plates which margin 

 the oral plates are relatively larger, being one half the size of the latter. 



PLANARI^. 

 Glossostoma. n. g. 



Body vermiform. Head continuous with the body. Eyes 10 16 in each side 

 of the head. Mouth subterminal, with a retractile tentacle on each side. Intes- 

 tinal tube ramose. Marine. 



1. G. nematoideum, pallide flavicans, pellucidum, filiforme, ocellis utrin- 

 que 10 16 minutissimis ; caecis intestinalibus brevibus obtusis. Long '1. unc. 



This animal has so little the appearance of a Planaria, that 1 long hesitated to 

 refer it to this genus; but on careful examination, I could perceive no distinct 

 character by which to separate it. The mouth is situated near the end, and on 

 the inferior surface of the body ; it is furnished on each side with a small blunt 

 retractile appendage. The ocelli are very minute, and situated on each side in 

 an oblong group, about half a line from the extremity, the abdominal cceca are 

 large and blunt. 



Elasmodes. n. g. 



Body dilated, flat. Head continuous with the body, without appendages. 

 Ocelli 5 on each side. Mouth antero-inferior, a?sophagus ventral ; intestinal tubes 

 reticulated, radiating. Marine. 



1. E. discus, latissima, planissima, pallida, pellucida, tubulis intestinalibus 

 reticulatis, tenuibus, e ventre oblongo radiantibus, ocellis utrinque 5 valde ap-

Very flat and thin, pellucid, only rendered darker in the middle by the slight 

 color of the intestinal tubes, which are very fine and numerous, radiating from a 

 central cavity which is five times as long as wide. Ocelli five on each side, 

 closely approximated ; groups separated by a space equal to one-third the distance 

 from them to the margin or apex. 



Typhlolepta? extensa, planissima, supra purpurea vel brunnea, mar- 

 gine pellucido, tubulis intestinalibus tenuissimis ; numerosissimis, e canali tenui 

 orientibus. Long. 1-25, lat. -32 unc. 



Less dilated than the last, but equally thin; owing to the immense number of 

 small intestinal tubes the color appears uniform, the central tube extends to within 

 two lines of each extremity. There are no visible ocelli.

Remarkable for the shortness of the tentacula, which, when fully extended, are 

 scarcely longer than the diameter of their base; they are arranged in two series ; 

 those in the outer series are pale at the base. The disc is radiately rugose, bril- 

 liant green, margined both internally and externally with purple. The root is 

 broad, the animals closely associated, capable of extending 1-25 inches. 



1 have named this species as a feeble tribute of respect to the philosopher, to 

 whom we owe the first rational classification of Zoophyta. 



The Committee on the following paper, by Dr. Leidy, reported in 

 favor of publication. 



On some American fresh-water Polyzoa. 

 By JosEVH Leidy, M. D. 



Since I described several species of fresh-water ciliated polyps in the last 

 number of the Proceedings, we have received the Report of the British Associa. 

 tion for 1850, in which I find a very able and complete report upon "the present 

 state of our knowledge of the fresh-water Polyzoa," by Prof. Allman, M. D. 



Prof. Allman has very correctly appli d the term Polyzoa, of Thompson, to 

 the ciliated polyps, because it had been employed prior to the application to 

 them of the term Hryozoa, of Ehrenberg. 



Prof. A. has also invented some very happy terms, applicable to different 

 parts of the structure of the Polyzoa. Thus for the common dermal system and 

 solid basis of a colony of polypes he uses the word L'cencecium. The external 

 tunic of the latter he calls the Ectocyst, and that lining the tubes the Endocyst, 

 and the disk supporting the teutaculai is named the Lophophore. 



According to the characters given to the genus ('ristatella, Cuv., the species 

 which I described in the last number of the Proceedings as C. magnifica, cannot 

 belong to that genus, as I then suspected; for Cristatella has a ' common flat- 

 tened disk adapted for locomotion," nor can it belong to Lophopus, Dumort, for 

 although this has its base of attachment fixed, yet the ova of the animal have no 

 marginal spines, and it therefore must form a distinct genus between Cristatella 

 and Lophopus, with the following diagnosis : 



PECTINATELLA, Leidy. 



Ccencecium massive, gelatinoid, hyaline, fixed, investing bodies. Orifices 

 arranged in irregular lobate areola; upon the free surface. Lophophore ores- 

 centic. Ova lenticular, with an annulus and marginal spines. 



1. Pectin ATELLA magnifica, Leidy. 



Cristatella magnifica, Leidy. Proc. A. N. S., V. 265. 



Hemark. Found only in shaded situations, always incrusting dead branches 

 of trees. 




1851.] 321 



PLUMATELLA, Lamarck. 



1. Pltimatella diffusa, Leidy. Pr. A. N. S., V. 261. 



2. Pl.UMATELLA NITIDA, LeUlj/. 



More robust than the preceding, color light olivaceous brown, consisting 

 usually of only a few branches ; tubes amphoraeform, without a keel, smooth or 

 transversely corrugated near the orifices which are entire. Length of the 

 articuli one line, breadth one-fourth of a line. Polyp has the same form as in 

 the preceding, and also the same number of tentaculag. 



Hubilution. Found with the preceding. 



Remarks in connection iuith Plumalella. Almost every stone, in many parts 

 of the Schuylkill river, particularly below the dam at Fairmount, has adher- 

 ing to it numerous eggs of Plumatella in short rows, which upon superficial in- 

 spection resemble prismatic crystals of some mineral. 



PALUDICELLA, Gerv%is. 



1. Paludicella elongataj Leidy. 



Coenaciuin attached throughout, or attached by only a (e\v articulations, the 

 remainder floating; delicate, very much branching, colorless or ambreous, 

 shining. Articulations very long, claviform ; tubes of exit variable in length, 

 placed close to the distal extremities ; orifices entire, 



Poli/ps with sixteen tentaculas arranged ia the form of an inverted cone. 

 Stomach brown in color. 



Mcusurernent.s. Articuli of ctEncecium to I line in length, by 1.133d in. in 

 breadth at the dilated part, and l-28.5th in. at the narrow part. 



Habitation, On the under side of stones in the Delaware and Schuylkill 

 rivers. It is found in vast profusion below the dam of the Schuylkill at 

 Philadelphia. 



Besides the foregoing, I have observed what I suspect to be the ccenoecium of 

 a new genus of Polyzoa, although I have never been able to detect the polyps if 

 such exist. It resembles when viewed by the naked eye a very minute Isis 

 hippuris, or the corraline Amphiroa corymbosa. Under the impression that it 

 belongs to the Polyzoa, it may be characterized as follows. 



URNATELLA, Leidy. 



Ccencccium membrano-corneous, consisting of several divergent, unbranching 

 filaments, attached by a common basis. Filaments consisting of a series of urn- 

 shaped articulations, with a solid axis passing through the whole, and having 

 to each articulation one, occasionally two, tubes of exit with the orifices expand 

 ed, placed inferiorly near their commencement. 



Urjjatella gracilts, Leidy. 



Usually three to five filaments arising from a common basis of attachment. 

 Articulations up to nine in number to a filament, very regularly nrnform except 

 the distal two which are inverted pyriform, decreasing in breadth from the first 

 to the last. Body portion of each urnform articulation yellowish white, trans- 

 lucent, with fine transverse bands or stricp, and punctae of brown ; neck or pe- 

 diculate portion, columnar, transversely contorted, expanded at base, black. 

 Tubes of exit one, occasionally two, to each articulation except the last, which 

 has none, placed at the lower part of the body portion of the articulation, and 




322 [November, 



curving upwards, with the orifice expanded and horizontal or nearly so, amber 

 colored with darker piinct;i>. Interior axis white, opaque. 



Measurements. Length of a filannent of 9 articulations 1 line ; first articula- 

 tion l-14nth in. in breadth, last l-220th in. 



Habitation. Found growing on the under side of stones in the sanie situa- 

 tions as Plumatella and Paludicella, in the river Schuylkill below the dam, at 

 Philadelphia, below low water mark. 



Remarks, A very beautiful and graceful form, as before mentioned resembling 

 a minature Isis hippuris. 



The ccencecium is hard and resistant, and has no carbonate of lime entering 

 into its composition as might probably be suspected. When compressed, the 

 axis or interior central, white, opaque column is squeezed out of the ruptured 

 articulations in the form of transparent colorless oleoid granules, from the 

 1.32,000th to the l-4,000th of an inch in diameter. 



I have frequently found this enigmatic body, which I suspect to belong, as 

 previously stated, to a Polyzoon, but I have never been able to detect the polyp. 

 The filaments appear never to go beyond nine articulations, nor have I ever 

 found more than five filaments to a group.

The Corresponding Secretafy read a Report, embracing the last six 

 months, which was adopted. 



Dr. Fisher offered the following, which was adopted : 



Resolved, That a Committee of three members be appointed to inquire 

 into the expediency of enlarging the Hall of the Academy, so as to fur- 

 nish greater accommodation for the Museum and Library, and to report 

 a plan for the same, together with an estimate of the expense, and to re- 

 port at the annual meeting, December 30th, next. 



Dr. J. C. Fisher, William S. Vaux, and Dr. Bridges, were appointed 

 the Committee under this resolution. 



The following Resolution was also adopted : 



Resolved, That the privilege of endorsing tickets of admission to the 

 Museum on public days, be granted to Mrs. Emily Taylor, widow of 

 Richard C. Taylor, late a distinguished member of this Institution, and 

 that she be authorized and invited to visit at all times the Museum and 

 Library.

 Referred to a Committee, consisting of Mr. Vaux, Dr. C. M. Wetherill, 

 and Dr. McEuen. 



Professor Horner read a history of some cases of Articular Inflamma- 

 tion of the Knee, treated successfully with Urate of Ammonia. Referred 

 to Dr. Leidy, Dr. Hallowell, and Dr. Rand. 



Professor Horner introduced to the Society Monseigneur Demers, 

 Bishop of Vancouver, who gave much interesting information respecting 

 the habits, language, and traditions of the Indian Tribes of Oregon, forty- 

 one of which, out of seventy-one, had been visited by him. He also of- 

 fered the hospitalities of the Mission to which he was attached, to such 



42 




324- [December, 



members as might be visiting that region, and expressed his wish to fur- 

 ther the objects of the Society. 



Professor Horner exhibited some specimens of Adipocire, fragments of 

 human bones, and mould, obtained from a cemetery which had been in use 

 for upwards of a century, and from which the remains are now being re- 

 moved. One specimen of crumbling bone was proved to be more than one 

 hundred years old. 



He also read the following by Mr. John Rommel, Jr., giving some 

 particulars in relation to the subject. 



" The cemetery from which the specimens were obtained has been used for 

 more than a century. 



The ground for the depth of tenor twelve feet is of ordinary yellow clay, below 

 which it is of a gravelly nature, fn the majority of places it is very hard and 

 dry, but in some places it is quite moist, and in one or two places actually 

 swampy. The workmen in removing the remains, in order to save time, dig a 

 trench about eight feet wide and about twenty feet long, then the following 

 eight feet are undermined, and this is thrown into the dug trench ; hence there is 

 necessarily a great confusion as to the dates of the remains. 



But comparatively few remnants of coffins were found, but an immense number 

 of bones still remained. 



In situations which were very free from moisture, no vestige of bone or coffin 

 was found after a lapse of twenty to twenty-five years, and even in less time ; 

 but as the ground became more moist, the preservation was more complete; and 

 where it was swampy, the preservation was almost perfect ; pieces of shavings 

 from the coffin (originally left there by the undertaker) being found, which had 

 been interred above forty years, and the soft parts adhering to the bones, in the 

 shape of Adipocire. I saw a corpse removed (having been interred thirty-five 

 years) which was in an almost complete state of preservation: the countenance 

 was so perfect, that the friends of the deceased might easily have recognized 

 him ; the garments were in a good state, as was also the coffin. 



In removing the earth, the workmen would probably strike a skull ; the ground 

 being then carefully removed, the perfect skeleton was displayed, all the bones 

 being in their respective places, as if the anatomist had carefully arranged them 

 previous to making an artificial skeleton ; no ligament or muscle to be seen. 



1 he latter were not seen in some instances in five or six years after burial. 

 Accompanying the bones, I ahvays observed some black matter, which was pro- 

 bably the remains of the coffin ; and where no bones at all were found, about a 

 shovel full of this black earth was seen, indicating the spot where the individual 

 had lain. 



The Bones. There was of course every variety of sizes, and in all stages of 

 preservation; sometimes I only saw the shaft of the tibia, which had no other 

 mark of distinction than the spine ; sometimes the femur, known only by its 

 comparative magnitude, and by the linea aspera; some were crumbled to small 

 pieces, and the slightest handling reduced them to powder. They were nearly 

 all brown or blackish, many looking as if they liad been smoked. 




1851.] 



325 



The Oz-ior. The odor arising from the graves was not perceived unless in close 

 contact with the remains, and then it was but faint and slightly disagreeable, and 

 when the air came in contact with it, it was immediately dispelled. The bones, 

 after being removed, had an earthy odor, and not at all disagreeable. 



The Sl-ull.ln all instances where the sutures of the skull had not been com- 

 pletely obliterated previous to death, by old age, &c., I observed the partial or 

 complete separation of the bones, in many instances lying side by side, complete- 

 ly separated, and in good condition. 



The Hair. I had expected to find much more hair than I did ; some few speci- 

 mens were found well preserved; one belonged to a young man, and was as 

 smooth, and in as fine a state, as if the hair-dresser had just left him, but he had 

 not been buried many years. In the majority of cases where it was found it was 

 only in small quantities, and was torn with the utmost facility. 



The stature of many of the individuals was remarkable, judging from the bones, 

 many were over six feet, and many over six feet five inches in size. Quite a 

 number of iron handles (belonging to the coffins) remained, either in a state of 

 partial or complete oxidation, and remains of breast plates were also found, but 

 the engraving was totally unintelligible. 



The interring of jewelry does not appear to have been fashionable in those days, 

 or else the workmen overlooked it ; only a piece of one ear-ring was found, and 

 that was as highly polished as if it had just come from the hands of the jeweller. 



From the discrepancy regarding dates, these are all the facts which I have been 

 able to obtain; but having heard from good authority that a similar enterprise will 

 be undertaken shortly, I am in hopes I shall be able to obtain more facts on this 

 interesting subject." 



Dr. Leidy exhibited a number of fossil reptilian and mammalian remains, 

 which he characterized verbally as follows : 



CiMOLiASAL'Rus MAGNUS, Leidy. A saurian established upon thirteen vertebrae, 

 apparently from one individual, found in the Green Sand of New Jersy, and pre- 

 served in the Museum of the Academy. Two of the vertebrae are posterior 

 dorsal, the remainder lumbar. All of them have the processes broken off, ex- 

 cepting one of the dorsal, which still preserves its transverse processes nearly 

 entire. 



The vertebral bodies are broader than they are long, being compressed cylin- 

 droidal in form, gradually expanding from their middle to the angular edge of the 

 articular surface. The latter are slightly concave, about one-half the depth of 

 those of Poecilopleuron Bucklandii, Deslch., with the centre a little prominent 

 and becoming slightly convex towards the edges. 



The transverse processes remaining in one of the specimens of dorsal vertebrae 

 are prominent, thick, irregularly cylindroid tubercles, projecting from the middle 

 of the side of the vertebral body, with an oblique articular facet for the rib. 



In the lumbar vertebrae the transverse processes incline downwards from the 

 lower part of the bodies laterally, as in Mososaurus.

The body is about as large, and has a general resemblance to that of Plesio- 

 saurus pachyomus, Owen, ropreseuted in fig. 3, tab. xx., of the Monograph on the 

 fossil reptiles of the Cretaceous Formation. It differs most remarkably from the 

 vertebral bodies of Plesiosaurus, in the articular faces forming distinct concave 

 disks, separated from the body by a constriction or short neck. The body is 

 relatively much broader in relation to its length than in Plesiosaurus. The spe- 

 cimen is a cervical vertebra. Upon eaeh side it has a deep, concave, transversely 

 oval, costal pit, with a very prominent, sharp border.

The fragment of a vertebra described by Dr. Dekay in the Annals Lyceum of 

 Nat. Hist, of New York, Vol. 3, p. 165, and represented in PI. 3, fig. 11, from 

 the Green Sand of New Jersey, and observed by that gentleman to be allied to 

 the Plesiosaurus, probably belongs to the Discosaurus vetustus. 



The vertebra described by Dr. Harlan in the Journal of this Academy, Vol. 4, 

 p. 232, and represented in pi. xiv. fig. 1, was referred to the Plesiosaurus. The 

 specimen was from the Green Sand of New Jersey, and is preserved in the cabi- 

 net of the Academy. It does not belong to a saurian, but is a posterior dorsal 

 vertebra of a cetacean allied to the Delphinus. The vertebral body is relatively 

 twice the length of what it is found to be in the latter. The transverse process 

 is also relatively short and broad; at its extremity it has an articular facet for the 

 head of a rib. 



The vertebra is probably the type of a form existing in a distinct genus of 

 ancient Cetacea, for which I propose the name Priscodklphinus. The species I 




1851.] 327 



dedicate to the memory of Harlan, under the name of Priscodelphinus Haklani, 

 Leidy , 



In the collection of the Academy there are preserved two caudal vertebrae of a 

 young cetacean, from the Green Sand of Jersey. These specimens are larger 

 than the dorsal vertebra just described, but from the length of their bodies, and 

 the width antero-posteriorly of the neural arch, I suspect them to belong to the 

 same genus of the latter, but a larger species, for which I propose the name 

 Pkiscodelphinus gkandjEvus, Leidy.

The two species of Priscodelphinus possess more than ordinary interest, from 

 their being the first mammalia which have been discovered in the cretaceous 

 formations. 



Crocodihts fastigiatus, Lcidy. Established upon a tooth which Mr. T. 

 Conrad informed me was obtained by Mr. Smiley from the Eocene formation of 

 Virginia. The specimen is about the size of that of Crocodilus champsoides, 

 Owen, represented in fig. 11, tab. v,, of the Monograph of the fossil Reptilia of 

 the London Clay by Prof. Owen. The crown has about the same length as in 

 the last mentioned species, but is more robust, more curved and pointed, with 

 more numerous ridges but not so coarse, and between the larger are from one to 

 four fine corrugated linear ridges. The fang is also a little more robust. The 

 enamel is jet black, shining. The osteo-dentine is thick, dark brown with a 

 resinous lustre.

Dr. L. further called the attention of the members to some very remarkable 

 fossil remains of mammalia from Nebraska, belonging to the collection of Dr. 

 D. D. Owen. 



The fossils consisted of a nearly entire cranium of Rhinoceros occidentalis, two 

 crania of Oreodon priscum,a large portion of the face of Arcbaeotherium Mortoni, 

 which has true molars resembling those of Chocropotamus and Hyracotherium, 

 and a very perfect turtle, which vi'as characterized as follows.

The species is named in honor of Dr. D.D. Owen, of New Harnnony, Indiana,

Dr. Owen made the following observations on the locality of the fossils 

 from the " Mauvaises Terres " of Missouri. 



The region of country where the remains of the fossil mammalia exhibited 

 were procured, is a part of the district known to the French Canadian voya^eura 

 of the Upper JVIissouri as the Mauvaises Terres or Bad Lands, which lie between 

 the Missouri river and the base of the Black Hills, and the waters of the Shagea 

 and Moreaux. It presents the appearance of the great bed of some ancient lake, 

 the base of which is some three hundred feet below the general level of the wide 

 expanse of prairie which rises in terraces towards the Rocky Mountains. 



This depressed valley of the Mauvaises Terres appears more a valley of exca- 

 vation than of subsidence, as is proved by the multitude of isolated pinnacles, 

 mounds, and curious outliers, which, having resisted the denuding forces, 

 stand in all imaginable fantastic shapes, memorials of the excavating forces that 

 have been at work. These rise to the height of from two to three hundred feet, and 

 form between them a complete labyrinth of intricate passages stretching as far as 

 the eye can reach, that soon bewilder the incautious explorer. 



These remarkable insulated peaks, like the sides of this great valley, are com- 

 posed of horizontal beds of indurated clays, marly strata, and thin beds of quartz 

 ore conglomerates, all probably belonging to the age of the Eocene tertiary, and 

 are the receptacles of those unique fossil remains, presenting a most extraordinary 

 assemblage of pachyderms, some of which seem to have combined the at present 

 anomalous character of ruminants, associated with a few carnivorous animals. 



The skulls, bones, and fossil fre'sh-water turtles are mostly found on mounds of 

 white, pale flesh-colored, and light grey and greenish marly and argillaceous 

 earths, the debris of denuded strata. The Palseotherium bed lies towards the 

 base of the section, from ten to twenty feet above the bottom of this great 

 valley. 



Further details concerning this curious country and its ancient fauna, together 

 with a section of the strata composing it, will be found in the forthcoming geo- 

 logical report of the North West.

A letter was read from Dr. D. Leasure, dated Lewistown, Pennsyl- 

 vania, December 5th, 1851, announcing the transmission of the skin of 

 an adult American Black Bear, for the Museum. 



Dr. Le Conte presented for publication in the Journal, the conclusion 

 of his paper entitled " An attempt to classify the Longicorn Coleoptera 

 of America North of Mexico." Referred to the Committee on the former 

 portions of the paper. 



Dr. Leidy read a paper from Mr. Charles Grirard,- intended for publi- 

 cation in the Proceedings, entitled "Notice of twelve new genera of 

 exotic Planarise, by Charles Girard," which was referred to Mr. Lea, Dr. 

 Ruschenberger, and Dr. Leconte. 



Mr. Cassin read a paper, intended for publication in the Proceedings, 

 entitled " Description of Birds of the genera Laniarius, Dicrurus, Grau- 

 calus, Pipra, and Picus, specimens of which are in the Academy of 

 Natural Sciences of Philadelphia." Referred to a Committee consisting 

 of Dr. Fisher, Dr. Wilson, and Dr. Watson. 



Dr. Leidy exhibited several fossils, from the Green Sand of New Jersey, which 

 he characterized as follows : 



Chei.onia geand^va, Leidy. 



Proposed upon three vertebral plates from the Green Sand of New Jersey, pre- 

 sented to the Academy by Mr. Wetherill. 



One of these has its anterior extremity broken off, but the length of the frag- 

 ment is greater than the breadth ; its form has been quadrilateral, and it was pro- 

 bably the first vertebral plate. Length 2 in. 8 lines ; breadth 23 lines. 



A second plate is broad hexahedral, the two lateral sides equal and shorter 

 than the anterior, which is concave, and the posterior which has the stump of a 

 pointed process. 



Length 26 lines ; breadth 32 lines ; thickness 5i lines. 



The third plate is hexahedral, sinuated in front, with a pointed process behind. 



Length with process 28 lines ; breadth 28 lines. 



Trionyx priscus, Leidy. 



Indicated by a fragment of the proximal extremity of a costal plate, from the 

 Green Sand of New Jersey. 



Thickness of plate 3i lines, with the rib proper five lines. 



The attention of the members was also directed to a fossil cranium from the 

 Eocene of Nebraska, from the collection of Dr. D. D. Owen, which was charact- 

 erized as follows : 



Machatrodus priM/^vus, Leidy and Oioen. 



Established upon a mutilated cranium, one-fourth less in size than the panther, 

 Felis concolor. 



The greater portion of the canines is broken away, but suflScient remains of 

 that of the right side to indicate that it was long, compressed in form, and den- 

 ticulate upon its concave edge. 




330 [December, 



Upon the right side the second and third superior molars, and the first and 

 second inferior are exposed to view, the others, excepting the first superior, 

 which has been shed, are enveloped in the matrix in which the fossil was im 

 bedded. Upon the left side the three inferior molars are preserved nearly entire. 



The alveoli for the superior incisors remain and are very large, and leave no 

 interval between them and the canine. 



The interval between the latter and the second molar is unusually large, being 

 7 lines. 



The chin is broken away but ten lines anterior to the first molar, the anterior 

 broken margin of the jaw at its upper part is only one line thick, and presents no 

 disposition to expand for the reception of the inferior canines. The coronoid 

 process is very short, being only nine lines. The face above the infra-orbitar 

 canals is very broad, and its anterior aspect with the forehead form a very abrupt 

 angle with the parietal crest, or the forehead is very high above the post orbitar 

 processes.

Dr. L. also made the cranium of a Musk-rat, obtained from a marl pit in New 

 Jersey, presented this evening by Dr. Burtt, the subject of the following remarks. 

 He observed, the specimen served as a hint to be cautious how we refer remains 

 of animals of a recent character to older formations. There are preserved in the 

 cabinet of the Academy fragments of a lower jaw, tibia, and antler of a deer, and 

 the cranium of a beaver, which were also found in digging marl in New Jersey. 

 All the specimens have the color of true marl fossils, but it is evident from the 

 character of the animals to which the remains belong, that they are only acci- 

 dental inhabitants of the Green Sand. They may have fallen into a narrow fissure 

 of a marl bed which was afterwards closed up, or they may have sunken in marl 

 mud on the banks of a stream, whose bed afterwards may have been filled up by 

 drift material, and thus the mode of access to the marl be obliterated. In the 

 cabinet is a specimen of the distal extremity of an os femoris of a Snipe, found in 

 the New Jersey marl, and described by Dr. Harlan* as a true fossil of the latter, 

 but this is also a fragment of a recent animal belonging to the same category as 

 the bones above mentioned. It is doubtful whether birds appeared very anterior 

 to the Eocene period ; the ornithicnites of the new Red Sandstone may yet prove 

 to be of reptilian origin. 



Dr. Fisher remarked, in relation to tbe fruit of the Palm, presented 

 this evening, that it was probably the fruit of the Corozo, mentioned by 

 Humboldt in his "Aspects of Nature," as being the smallest of the 

 Cocoa Palms.

Dr. LeConte read a paper, intended for publication in the Pi-oceedings, 

 entitled "Synopsis of the Lampyrides of temperate North America." 

 Referred to Dr. Leidy, Dr. McEuen, and Mr. Lea. 



Dr. Leidy made some remarks upon the two species of Rhinoceros 

 from Nebraska, which he had named R. Nebrascensis and R. occidentalis, 

 and said he had satisfied himself they both belonged to the sub-genus 

 Acerotherium, Kemp., a good character of distinction of which, in the 

 teeth, is the presence of a well developed basal ridge. 



Mr. Lea exhibited a complete suite of specimens of Unio multiplicatus, 

 from the Western Rivers of the United States, and made some extended 

 remarks on the Family Naidee.

This very distinct genus forms the 3d division of Laporte's genus Photinus, 

 (An. Ent. Fr. 2, 144,) and to it he has given the uncouth name of Tclcphoroides; 

 fortunately his Gallic patriotism has led him to print this as a French word, so 

 that we are enabled to replace it by the hitherto unpublished name of Dejean. 

 While on this subject I may add, that Laporte in this, as in almost every other 

 instance, has completely overlooked the real distinguishing characters of the

These two species are very closely allied, yet the differences in the form of 

 the thorax are sufficient to distinguish them. I have received them from Dr.

 species has much shorter antenna than the others, and the terminal articula. 

 tions are more rounded.

 oribus, articulo 4to valde bilobato; ungues simplices, paranychio lato rotundato, 

 intermedio muniti; elytra abdomine multo breviora; caput pone oculos vix 

 angustatum. 



The form of the palpi sufficiently distinguishes this genus from the preceding; 

 it approaches much closer to Telephorus. The male has a small additional 

 anal segment ; the female has the penultimate joint of the abdomen deeply 

 emarginate. In both sexes the superior segment is dilated, thickened at the 

 edges and emarginate at apex, so that it projects on each side of the lower 

 segment like a lateral appendage. 



Another genus with short elytra, from Panama, approaches very closely to 

 this, but the second and third joints of the antennse together are not longer than 

 the fourth ; the palpi are strongly securiform, and the last joint of the tarsi has 

 no appendage between the claws.

The Committee on Mr. Cassin's description of new species of Birds, 

 reported in favor of publication. 



Descriptions of birdsofthe genera Laniarius, Dlcrurus^ Graucalus, Manacusand 

 PicuSj specimens of which are in the collection of the Academy of Natural 

 Sciences of Philadelphia. 



By John Cassin. 



1. Laniarius carbonarius, nobis. 

 Form. Strong and rather heavy, wings short with the fourth, fifth, sixth and 



seventh quills longest and nearly equal, tail rather short, somewhat rounded and 



45 




348 [December. 



with all the feathers having a crimped appearance throughout their length. 

 Plunnage of the rump long and silky. About the size oi Dryoscopus rufiventris^ 

 (Swainson.) 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 8i inches, 

 wing 31, tail 3i inches. 



Colors. Entire plumage above and below brownish black, palest on the quills, 

 feathers of the rump paler at their basis, bill black. 



Hab. Western Africa, discovered by Robert MacDowell, M. D., late of Sierra 

 Leone. 



Obs. This species resembles no other with which lam acquainted. Its rather 

 short wings and tail give it more the general appearance of a Thamnophilus than 

 I have noticed in any other African species. It is peculiar, so far as I know, for 

 the uniform color of its plumage, which is (rump included) black. 



2. Dicrurzis aculeatusy nobis. 



Form. Small, but rather larger than D. Lndwigii, A. Smith. Bill rather 

 long, curved at the tip, toothed and sharply pointed ; wings with the fourth quill 

 slightly longest, but the third, fourth and fifth nearly equal; tail distinctly though 

 not deeply forked. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about li inches, 

 wing 4J, tail 3! inches. 



Colors. Entire plumage black with a greenish lustre, inner webs and under 

 surface of quills pale brownish, bill and feet black. 



Hab. Fazogloa, Eastern Africa. 



Obs. Resembles D. miisicus, Vieill., but is smaller and has the bill longer and 

 much stronger, comparatively ; it is smaller also than D. canipennis, Swainson, 

 which it somewhat resembles in having the light colored webs of the quills, but 

 can easily be distinguished by its shorter wings and tail and stronger bill. It is 

 larger than D. Lndwigii, A. Smith, and differs from all the species here men- 

 tioned in the relative lengths of the quills. Bonaparte is mistaken in making 

 D. emarginatus (Licht.) a distinct species, it is described by Lichtenstein in 

 Verzeichniss, p. 52, and there expressly stated to be the bird figured by Le Vail- 

 lant, p. 167, (which is D. musicus, Vieill.) 



3. Graucalus azureus, nobis. 



Form. Small, about the size of G. hypoleucus, Gould. Specimen now about 

 to be described not in good plumage, ends of quills and tail feathers worn, wings 

 rather long. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 7i inches, 

 wing 4i, tail about 4 inches. 



Colors. Front, extending to each eye, quills and tail black, entire plumage of 

 other parts light blue, tertiaries tipped with irregular lines of white and black. 



Hab. Western Africa, discovered by Robert MacDowell, M. D., late of Sierra 

 Leone. 



Obs. This species which is remarkable for its color, appears to resemble the 

 bird figured in Voyage au Pole Sud (Astrolabe & Zelee) Ois. pi. 9, fig. 3, which 

 is named in Bonaparte's Consp. Av. " Graucalus Boyeri." It is however, much 

 smaller. I have seen only the specimen now described. 




1851.] 349 



4. Manacus flaveoltis, nobis. 



Form. Very similar to those of M. gutturosus, (Desm.) and M. Candei, 

 (Parz.) 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about SJ inches, 

 wing 2, tail about 1| inches. 



Colors. Very similar to those of M. gutturosus, but with the parts which are 

 white in that species, pale yellow in this. Top of the head, back, wings and 

 tail, black ; throat, breast, shoulders and broad collar around the back of the neck, 

 pale yellow, running into cinereous on the abdomen. 



Hab. Bogota, New Grenada. 



Obs. Two specimens of this little bird are in the collection, labelled as com- 

 ing from Bogota, and both presenting the singular variation in color, from the 

 common M. gutturosus^ on the strength of which I have considered it specifically 

 distinct. In point of color it may be stated as intermediate between M. guttur- 

 0S71S and Candei. It is smaller than the latter. 



5. Picics thyroideus, nobis. 



Form. Similar to that of P. varius, Linn., but rather larger and stouter, wings 

 with the third quill longest, legs and toes rather slender, tail rather broad. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 8| inches, 

 wing 5|, tail 31 inches. 



Colors. 9 Breast with a large transverse patch or belt of black; middle of 

 the abdomen pale yellow. Head and throat brownish buff, with obscure longi- 

 tudinal stripes of black, back, wing coverts, sides of the body beneath and under 

 tail coverts striped transversely with black and sordid yellowish white, rump 

 and upper tail coverts white, the latter with black marks on their outer webs ; 

 quills, and tail black, more or less spotted with white. 



Hab. California, discovered by Mr, John G. Bell, of New York. 



Obs. Mr. Bell's two specimens are females, and are as yet unique. This 

 species is a strict congener of Picus varius, Linn., but does not resemble it in 

 colors, nor any other species which I have met with. 



The Committee on Dr. Leidy's paper entitled, " Contributions to Hel- 

 minthology/' reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings. 



Contributions to Helminthology. 

 By Joseph Leidy, M. D. 



MICR0ST0MUM1 Oersted. (Eustomum.) 



Body elongated, compressed cylindroid, vibrillated ; increasing by transverse 

 segmentation in pairs. Head continuous with the body, furnished upon each 

 side with a respiratory fovea. Mouth antero-inferior ; intestinal canal produced 

 anterior to the mouth in the form of a coecum ; cesophagus amphoraform, mus- 

 cular, not protractile ; anus at first (after segmentation) open, afterwards 

 becoming closed. Ocelli none. Minute rhabdoccela inhabiting fresh, water. 



This genus is the Microstomum of Oersted, if what I have observed to be 




350 [December, 



lateral respiratory foveae of the head are, according to him and other authors, 

 ocelli destitute of pigment. 



In numerous individuals of what I have considered below to be of three dis- 

 tinct species of the genus, they were always observed to be in a state of division 

 by pairs, and the primary pair of segments about their middle had already 

 developed respiratory foveae, and were slightly indented preparatory to division 

 before the first pair were separated. 



1. MicRosTOMUM (Eustomum'^ Philadelphicum, Leidy. 



Body linear, slightly attenuated posteriorly ; head conoidal^ with the apex 

 surmounted by a small oval papilla ; tail obtusely rounded. Respiratory fovea 

 sub-hemispherical, placed at the base of the cone of the head. Mouth oval, pro- 

 tractile ; (Esophagus keg-shaped, intestine narrowed, cylindroid, dilated at the 

 commencement. Colorless, translucent, vibrillated ; Increasing by transverse 

 segmentation, always observed in the process of forming two segments. 



Length 2-5ths line, by l-500th in. broad. 



Habitation. Found in the water of marshes and ditches in the neighborhood 

 of Philadelphia. 



2. MiCROSTOMUM {Eustomum') variabile, Leidy. 



Body broad, linear ; anteriorly and posteriorly obtusely rounded. Respiratory 

 fovea, longitudinally oval, lateral. Intestine very broad. Colorless, increasing 

 by twos. 



Length from 1.80th to' 1. 24th of an inch by 1.800th to 1.400th in. 

 broad. 



Habitation. With the preceding. 



3. MicRosTOML'M (Eustomurn\ caudatum, Leidy. 



Body long, narrow, linear ; anteriorly obtusely rounded, posteriorly ending 

 in a narrow, blunt, elevated tail l-400th in. long from the position of the anus; 

 increasing by twos, the tail of the anterior segments projecting above and its 

 whole length posterior to the head of the succeeding segment. 



Length 3-4ths to 1^ lines; breadth l-SOOth to the l-250th in. 



Habitation. With the preceding.

 segmentation, from which the species was first described, preserved alone in a 

 glass vessel with some confervjE, upon the occurrence of cold weather passed 

 into the perfect condition as follows : 



Body long, cylindroid, hyaline, permitting the ash-colored or yellowish intes- 

 tine to be seen through the integument, divided into from 50 to 65 annulations, 

 furnished with a distinct girdle posterior to the third annulus from the mouth, 

 which extends the breadth of three annuli. Podal hooks in fasciculi of 10 to 

 12. Setae commencing after the girdle, usually one often two upon each side 

 of the annuli. Head obtusely rounded and prolonged into a cylindroidj very 

 moveable, digitiform, transversely wrinkled proboscis. Caudal annulus termi- 

 nating in two short lobes 




1851.] 351 



Length 3-4ths to 1 inch ; breadth l-5th to l-4th of a line. Length of pro- 

 boscis l-20th inch. 



Remarks upon the habits. When at rest the worm lies with the anterior 

 four-fifths of the body upon the surface of the mud at the bottom of the water, 

 with the tail fifth buried. It is very active in its movements. It also con- 

 structs tubes of mud. It is hermaphrodite, and copulates in the same manner 

 as the earth worms. 



In a number of individuals I observed bunches of spermatozoa, and in several 

 of the same from three to five nearly completely formed ova placed just poste- 

 rior to the girdle. 



The eggs when extruded were attached to the inside of the vessel in which 

 the worms were kept. They consisted of an oblong quadrilateral translucent, 

 whitish, papyraceous web, enclosing a light amber colored, bottle-like case, 

 with an open neck, and the body containing an opaque white globular mass 

 the true egg. 



The perfect worm after living about two months died. Some of the ova 

 several weeks after their extrusion were observed to have the young almost 

 perfected, and these a few days after their escape presented the following cha- 

 racters : 



Body cylindroid, divided into 35 annulations, each with a pair of fasciculi of 

 4 or 5 hooks ; posterior to the first three also provided on each side with one or 

 two setas. Tail bilobed. Head as in the parent. No girdle ; no indication of 

 division ; and no apparent developing annuli at the tail end. Length 2 lines. 



The Committee on Dr. Le Conte's paper, concluding his descriptions 

 of the Longicorn Coleoptera of the United States, reported in favor of 

 publication in the Journal. 



The Committee, consisting of Dr. J. C. Fisher, Wm. S. Vaux and 

 Dr. Bridges, appointed at a late meeting " to inquire into the expedi- 

 ency of enlarging the Hall of the Academy, so as to furnish greater 

 accommodation for the Museum and Library, and to report a plan, with 

 an estimate of the expense," offered a report, which was adopted, 

 recommending the raising of the roof of the building sixteen feet higher, 

 the division of the interior of the Hall into two compartments, by a 

 floor thrown across from the second main gallery, and the opening of 

 two windows into each hall on the north and south sides. 



The entire expense of the improvement, as estimated by a contractor, 

 was $6,500, to meet which the Committee proposed that subscriptions 

 be solicited, both from members and from the citizens of Philadelphia. 



Two resolutions appended to the report, one that it was expedient to 

 enlarge the Hall according to the plan submitted, and to appoint a 

 Committee for the purpose of obtaining subscriptions; and the second 

 giving the form of the subscription, were also adopted. Action on a 

 third resolution was postponed for the present.

[December, 



The following reports were read and adopted 



LIBRARIAN'S REPORT 



For 1851. 



The rapid and steady progress which the Library has made during the past 

 few years, in the departments of Natural and Physical Science, and various 

 kindred subjects, has continued during the present year the number of additions 

 amounting to 2,262. 



The usual table, showing the increase under each head, is herewith submitted : 



Of the whole number, 42 have been contributed by authors ; 32 by editors ; 

 77 by Societies and Corporations ; 927 by Dr. Wilson,- 1,025 by Mr. Edward 

 Wilson ; 87 by other members and correspondents ; 7 by Departments of the 

 United States ; and 65 have been derived from miscellaneous sources ; 

 total 2,262. 



In addition to these, nearly 700 volumes, periodicals, &c., and pamphlets pre- 

 sented by Mr. Edward Wilson, are also in the Hall, but not yet recorded. The 

 entire number actually contributed this year, by this most zealous friend of our 

 Institution, will not fall far short of 1,700 of all descriptions. 



Although far distant from us, Mr. Wilson has manifested the liveliest interest 

 in the success and advancement of the Academy, and has exerted his industry, 

 and given his time and attention in searching out rare productions for its Library, 

 to an extent which entitle him to our warmest thanks. Many of these works 

 have been drawn from sources where they were nearly lost to science and the 

 world. 



For Dr. Wilson's contributions, numerous as ever, no additional commendation 

 is needed here ; his eulogy is already written on all around us. 



Upon reference to the table, it will be seen that the additions to the different 

 departments of Natural History form a large proportion of the whole number. 

 Those also from authors, editors, societies, and from our own members and cor- 

 respondents, are as numerous as usual. These latter have averaged, for succes- 




1851.] 353 



sive years, several hundred volumes, periodicals and pamphlets, and, without 

 other aid, vsrould soon have filled our shelves. 



We most cordially invite such contributions, which are gratifying, both as 

 evincing a regard for the Institution, and as affording us opportunities for recipro- 

 cating. From Societies abroad, however, we have yet much to ask. Although 

 in correspondence and exchange with many of them of the highest distinction, 

 there are others which have failed to embrace the offers which we have 

 extended to them. On this account foreign Societies, previously receiving 

 our Journal and Proceedings, are now no longer on the exchange list, the only 

 return for our publications having been formal acknowledgments of their receipt 

 by these Societies. The value which we may now justly claim for the Journal 

 and Proceedings of this Institution, entitles us to hope for a better and more 

 liberal feeling hereafter. 



Among the members of the Academy most conspicuous this year for contribu- 

 tions to the Library, I may mention Mr. George Ord and Mr. Robert Pearsall. 

 To Mr. Ord we are indebted for 27 folio and quarto volumes of works; and to 

 Mr. Pearsall for eight 4to and folio volumes of valuable dictionaries in foreign 

 languages. To Mr. Haidinger, of Vienna, a correspondent of the Institution, we 

 are under obligations for numerous works, of which he is either author or 



editor. 



This constant and rapid influx of books and pamphlets has again nearly 

 exhausted our available room. Scarcely two years have elapsed since the 

 adjoining apartment was fitted up for the reception of books, yet but little space 

 remains for additions, even in single volumes, and certainly none for any large 

 series. Under such circumstances, and should our present rate of increase con- 

 tinue, it will be necessary to make further provision for accommodating the 

 books. I therefore respectfully ask the early attention of the Society to this 

 important matter, merely suggesting, on this occasion, that the apartment to the 

 North of the one just referred to, and adjoining it, and now occupied as a dupli- 

 cate room, and used also for unpacking parcels and boxes, could be very readily 

 altered, at a moderate expense, and made to answer the required purpose. 



[ would also suggest to the Society the propriety of selling the duplicate 

 volumes, now for the most part in the room last mentioned, and also the exten- 

 sive series of French Documents. This will even be necessary, should the pro- 

 posed alteration be determined upon, as no space could be spared for them, 

 except in the cellar, where they would not be likely to benefit by the change. 



The proceeds of the sale of these works would, even at auction rates, form a 

 fund which could be most advantageously applied at present to Library pur- 

 poses. 



1 also beg again to call the attention of the Society to a proposition made in 

 the last report, viz : to extend the prohibition of taking books from the Hall to 

 all the worhs in the Library. No reason now exists for permitting'any work to 

 leave the Hall, every facility for consulting them here being afforded, that can 

 be asked for. Although thus far we have sustained no losses, nor has any injury 

 been done, since their removal to the present'apartment, yet future contingencies 

 should be guarded against, and the fact steadily kept in view, that a single care- 

 less member may occasion a loss which neither time nor money could repair. 

 The practice of loaning keys to strangers, who are usually irresponsible persons, 




354 [December, 



and admitting thenri to the Library at hours when the proper officers are not pre- 

 sent, is of very doubtful propriety, and, unless checked, may sooner or later 

 cause the Society great regret. 



Respectfully submitted by 



Wm. S. Zanxzinger, 



Librarian. 



REPORT OF THE CURATORS 



For 1S51. 



The Museum of this Academy, placed under the charge of the Curators and the 

 Committees of the several departments, continues, up to the preseut time, in the 

 best state of preservation. The depredation of insects npon destructible objects 

 appears to be completely under control, through the combined influence of the 

 vapor of ether and the oil of turpentine. 



The collection of Mamm.alia, during the past year, has been classified and 

 arranged by Drs. Bridges and Fisher. 



All departments have received valuable additions, as follows : 



Mammalia. Of this class there have been presented 28 specimens, comprising 

 20 species, among which was a remarkably fine specimen of a Polar bear, for 

 which we are indebted to Dr. E. K. Kane, U. S. N.; also a large Rocky Moun- 

 tain sheep, presented by the Smithsonian Institution. The others are principally 

 from Dr. G. Watson, Mr. W. S. Wood, Dr. J. C. Fisher, and Mr. W. S. Vaux. 



Aves. 42 bird skins and 17 species of eggs have been presented, chiefly by 

 Col. Geo. A. McCall, U. S. A., Messrs. Joshua Lippincott, John Lambert, J. D. 

 Sergeant, and Dr. G. R. B. Horner. 



There were also presented 29 nests and eggs of common English birds by 

 Edward Wilson, Esq. 



Reptilia. We are under obligation to Prof. Franklin Bache, for the original 

 collection of reptiles formerly belonging to Dr. Jacob Green, consisting of 94 

 specimens in bottles and 15 species dried Cheloniae. Besides these we have 

 received 25 species, chiefly from Dr. G, Watson and Mr. R. H. Kern. 



Pisces. Of these 26 species have been presented, principally by Prof. F 

 Bache. 



Mollusca. 306 species of shells have been added to our collection, the princi- 

 pal donors being Dr. J. L. Burtt, U. S. N., Dr. Wier Mitchell, and Dr. Thos. 

 Stewardson. 



Insecta. Of which 200 species have been received, chiefly Coleoptera and 

 Lepidoptera. 



Crustacea. To this department we have received the greatest accession. 

 Altogether 2,384 specimens have been presented. Of these 1,482 specimens, 

 comprising 410 species, constituted the collection of M. Guerin Meneville, 

 presented to the Academy by Dr. T. B. Wilson. 



Annelida and Myriapoda. Of which we have had presented 12 species. 



Zoophyta. Of this class 117 specimens have been presented, chiefly by Mr. 

 Edward Wilson. 




1851.] 355 



Comparative Anatomy .In this department there have been presented and 

 deposited 43 crania of man, and other mammalia, 2 mounted skeletons, and 7 

 miscellaneous objects. In this collection are particularly worthy of notice, a 

 very perfect skeleton of a Narwhal with a tusk 8 feet in length, and four crania 

 of the polar bear, male and female, presented by Dr. E. K. Kane. 



The other skeleton presented is a remarkably fine one of a dog, articulated by 

 Mr. Robert Nash, and obtained from Dr. F. W. Lewis. 



Botany. 73 species of dried plants and fruits have been added to our collec- 

 tion, of which 64 species consist of fresh-water and marine algae, presented by 

 Mr. John Hooper, of New York. 



r alaontology . 380 species of fossils have been received, among which are 42 

 species of minute and rare Eocene tertiary British fossils, arranged upon tablets 

 accompanied by magnified views, prepared by the British Natural History 

 Society, presented by Dr. T. B. Wilson. Also, the specimens from which were 

 described the Crocodilus antiquus Leidy, and Balaena prisca Leidy, from the 

 Miocene tertiary of Virginia, presented by Mr. Robert E. Nash; and the original 

 specimens from which was described the Platygonus compressus Le Conte, pre- 

 sented by Dr. J. L. Le Conte. 



Mineralogy . 238 specimens of minerals have been presented. Among these 

 was a remarkably fine large group of crystals of quartz, from Cochin China, 

 presented by Dr. J, L. Burtt, and some fine specimens of Red Chabasie (Acadia- 

 lite), Stilbite, &c., from Nova Scotia, presented by our correspondent. J. L. 

 Chipman, Esq. The remainder were obtained principally from Dr. W. L. Sher- 

 man, U. S. N., and Mr. W. S. Vaux. 



As valuable additions to the Academy, for the use of its members, are two 

 excellent compound achromatic microscopes, one manufactured by Oberhaiiser, 

 and deposited by Dr. J. K. Mitchell ; the other manufactured by Pritchard, and 

 deposited by J. P. Wetherill, Esq. 



Considering the very great value of the property of the Academy we cannot take 

 too much care in its preservation, and without having the slightest wish that the 

 access of the members themselves, to the Museum and Library, should be re- 

 stricted, we think it would be of advantage if all were precluded from lending their 

 keys of entrance to the building to any other than members or correspondents, 

 excepting under such circumstances as a majority of the Curators and Librarian 

 may deem advisable. 



All of which is respectfully submitted by 



Joseph Leidy, 

 Chairman of Curators, 



The Annual Report of the Treasurer was read, and referred to the 

 Auditors. 



A note was read from Mr. Samuel Powel, declining a re-election as 

 Recording Secretary, in consequence of the necessity of his prolonged 

 absence from the city. 



The following Committee was appointed to solicit subscriptions for the 

 purpose of enlarging the Hall of the Academy, under the resolution
